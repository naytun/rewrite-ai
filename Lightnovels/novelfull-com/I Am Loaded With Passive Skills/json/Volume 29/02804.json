He scooped up some snow to wash his face, and when he looked again, he shivered violently:</p><p>“This isn’t a dream?”</p><p>“His Cutting Path is smoother than me pulling … uh, drinking water?”</p><p>While others were shocked, Xu Xiaoshou realized it was a bit too easy and panicked first; instantly, his second true body, looking deathly, flew out from nowhere.</p><p>——His true self was only half a step away from the Cutting Path, but the second true body couldn’t cultivate and evolve. If this one couldn’t keep up, it wasn’t the path being cut, it was the aggrieved second true body!</p><p>However, the second true body had come with a mission this time, and it went directly in front of Ye Xiaotian, who was a demi-saint with slightly reddened eyes:</p><p>“Master Dean, I have a question …”</p><p>“Dare I ask, am I in the process of Cutting Path, or am I ruining my cultivation level? Is Cutting Path really this simple?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian glanced at Xu Xiaoshou in front of him, then back at another Xu Xiaoshou who was undergoing Cutting Path not far away.</p><p>He was silent for a moment.</p><p>Not mincing words, your question is also what I have been contemplating…</p><p>Moreover, why is it, being sovereigns of Upanishad, that your Cutting Path seems so easy and effortless?</p><p>“Continue as you are, in any case, judging by the results, everything seems fine, and your way of Cutting Path has inspired me,” Ye Xiaotian spoke as he straightened up, posing as a highbrow sage as the Dao Imparting Mirror focused on him.</p><p>“You can say what you like, Master Dean, but don’t float away…” The second true body grabbed his ankles and pulled him down, “I need a drop of your blood.”</p><p>“What for?” Ye Xiaotian looked wary; blood was a very sensitive matter.</p><p>“I used to have confidence, but now I’m a bit anxious. It would be terrible if I finished Cutting Path but couldn’t grasp Upanishad. I need to borrow some of your blood to try out something…”</p><p>These words made Ye Xiaotian’s pupils dilate suddenly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, this trickster, was planning something again, and his ideology…</p><p>“What are they talking about?”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui tried to enlarge the image on the Dao Imparting Mirror while also capturing the sound.</p><p>Unfortunately, both image and sound were very blurry, and he could only whisper an improvised narration:</p><p>“We see Lord Shou pausing halfway through Cutting Path. Can a Spiritual Cultivator actually pause the Cutting Path mid-way? Seems a bit mysterious…”</p><p>“Lord Shou is pretty fierce, apparently stopping halfway through Cutting Path, discovering he lacked experience, and asking questions on the spot, since Ye Xiaotian, the demi-saint, is his former Master Dean…”</p><p>“Great! Now there are two Lord Shous, presumably one is his Clone, and the one transcending tribulation should be the true body…”</p><p>“Great! Demi-saint Ye gave the Clone a drop of blood. What are they up to?”</p><p>“The Clone teleported over, and Lord Shou’s true body picked up the drop of blood. He pulled out something … what is this thing? A clay figure? A statue? Blood, dripped onto it?”</p><p>“Someone who knows, please! I can hardly keep narrating!”</p><p>“Are all Spiritual Cultivator’s Cutting Paths this weird, watching it feels like child’s play?”</p><p>…</p><p>The audience from the five regions was astounded!</p><p>Unlike Feng Zhongzui, who was halfway informed about Spiritual Cultivation, those now in front of the mirror were experts!</p><p>“Can you just stop Cutting Path halfway, doesn’t Feng Zhongzui have any common sense? The strange and anomalous one isn’t the Spiritual Cultivator; it’s Lord Shou!”</p><p>“Who can stop Cutting Path? Who dares to perform Cutting Path publicly?”</p><p>“Shouldn’t one seek a secluded place, focusing wholly on making a breakthrough, not daring to be distracted?”</p><p>“Unbelievable, haha, this Feng Zhongzui, still talking about Lord Shou stopping midway because something felt wrong and asking for advice… Wait, blood? The Imitator?”</p><p>“That must be the Imitator! The fame-making item of the former Transformation Division Chief Yi, one of the ten Great Psionic Weapons… It’s said that dropping blood on the Imitator could mimic that person, gaining insights and usage as well as a wealth of experience, but all temporary… Lord Shou, ah? Couldn’t be, could it?”</p><p>“Lord Shou, is he thinking of, could he possibly…”</p><p>“He’s seeking Enlightenment at Jade Capital City and becoming a sovereign of Upanishad?”</p><p>…</p><p>Standing on the Space Dao Disc, with Unity of Man and the Heavens state activated, path energy flowed continuously around Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Indeed, he was about to open another Upanishad!</p><p>The blood-dripped Imitator was just a ruse.</p><p>After all, he had tried it, and the insights gained were not truly his, therefore could never achieve another Space Upanishad.</p><p>But the Field of Profound Dao, the Profound Dao Seed could—Ye Xiaotian’s blood was just to cover this layer!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was now playing a big game, more anxious amidst anxiety, wanting to devise a conservative plan for exploring new paths in Spiritual Cultivation through this thicket.</p><p>“Passive Points: 78114978.”</p><p>An Upanishad, in fact, doesn’t need ten million passive points, not even eight hundred thousand, just five to six hundred thousand will do.</p><p>Since he had a solid foundation, even with a lower percentage over ten percent progress, and higher would be hard to assimilate completely with the Great Path, thus it wouldn’t cost much passive points.</p><p>The previously reckless Life Upanishad cost only six hundred seventy thousand passive points.</p><p>Having strutted around Jade Capital City for so long, he had almost replenished a third of what he had expended.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he was using the Mang Upanishad at practically no cost!</p><p>With his prior experience, he was now able to do it effortlessly, spending tens of thousands of Passive Points without even counting, directly converting them into Profound Dao Seeds.</p><p>“Space Dao Disc (15%).”</p><p>“Space Dao Disc (16%).”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Space Dao Disc (23%).”</p><p>“Space Dao Disc (34%).”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Space Dao Disc (68%).”</p><p>“Space Dao Disc (77%).”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Huh?</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was momentarily dazed then rubbed his eyes, looking again at the Space Power Upanishad Formation beneath Xu Xiaoshou’s feet.</p><p>Suddenly, he glared fiercely, almost splitting his veins as fresh blood burst from his eyes!</p><p>Gazing at Xu Xiaoshou who was supposed to be at a “Cutting Path Moment” and supposedly unable to make any more significant breakthroughs, yet just because of a drop of his own blood…</p><p>The Space Power Upanishad Formation beneath his feet slowly lit up!</p><p>In the end, it nearly rivaled his own, as if it too had grasped the spatial upanishad!</p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiaotian went mad.</p><p>His heart felt as if it were torn out in the cold winter snow and left on the roadside by his kin (Lord Shou), attracting a wild dog (Lord Shou himself) that pounced forward and viciously bit it.</p><p>This dog was insane!</p><p>It was a real mad dog, definitely not human at all.</p><p>After biting the heart, it pressed down on Ye Xiaotian and continued to gnaw, crunching bite after bite, slowly consuming his sanity bit by bit, and finally, it even defecated a huge pile on his face—was the dog mastering spatial upanishad too?</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian, eyes blazing, charged forward, “Stop! Xu Xiaoshou, you stop!”</p><p>Using my blood, my understanding of space attributes, to fulfill yourself… well done, Xu Xiaoshou, what nefarious cunning, can’t you cultivate on your own?</p><p>Your mimicking is driving people into madness, you’re not human, you’re a lunatic!</p><p>The second true body from behind embraced Ye Xiaotian, “Master Dean, where are you going?”</p><p>“Get off me, give me back my blood, give it back…” Ye Xiaotian cried.</p><p>He watched as the Space Power Upanishad beneath Xu Xiaoshou’s feet fully formed.</p><p>He saw that it had become a settled matter, admitting that he was being petty.</p><p>He just didn’t like seeing another person mastering space upanishad, sharing the joy renowned across the world, he just didn’t like it, what could he do?</p><p>Under the heavens, who could be so magnanimous!</p><p>Ye Xiaotian wailed bitterly.</p><p>Just in time, Feng Zhongzui turned the Dao Imparting Mirror towards him.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian turned his tears into laughter, waving his sleeve nonchalantly, “Hey! Such a trivial matter.”</p><p>“Thank you, Master Dean,” said the second true body sincerely from behind.</p><p>I want to kill you, Sang Qiye, what kind of disciple have you raised… Hearing the thanks, Ye Xiaotian felt shattered as if his soul had left his body, yet he could still face the Dao Imparting Mirror, pointing at Xu Xiaoshou who was in the midst of Cutting Path, and numbly chuckled, “Guess I’m also somewhat his master, hehehe, haha!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Space Dao Disc (80%).”</p><p>With intent as his sword, Xu Xiaoshou slashed downward.</p><p>“Crack…”</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The Space Dao Disc shattered, and light merged into his body.</p><p>Heaven and earth fell silent, then an endless rush of spiritual energy howled toward him, furiously entering his body.</p><p>Energy reserve swelled, path energy like tidal waves.</p><p>In disbelief, it all became reality…</p><p>“Cutting Path!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
