those who could fly, took to the skies; the rest who were too slow to react, too late to avoid, were all shredded by the strand of sword cognition contained in the sword energy.</p><p>Compared to Penetrating Divine Senses 2.0, those third or fourth-grade defensive spiritual weapons were as flimsy as paper, easily destroyed with a flick of a finger.</p><p>The sword energy surged through the crowd like parting rivers and cutting waves, accompanied by curses and frightened screams, tearing towards the grey sky and striking at the great robed figure in the higher void.</p><p>“What the hell…”</p><p>The higher void figure waved a hand.</p><p>The blue thunder of the Power of the Higher Void then transformed into a gigantic hand, attempting to smash the covert sword energy attack.</p><p>But on contact…</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>Thunder, fragile as clay.</p><p>The great robed figure in the higher void hadn’t even lowered his hand when horror spread across his face, his right arm dragging half a torso that hadn’t managed to twist away was pierced, sliced through, and sent flying by the sword energy.</p><p>“Ah—”</p><p>Tearing blood sprayed across the sky.</p><p>There was no need to call for silence at this moment; everyone who witnessed the sword and the madness of the higher void perpetrator fell eerily silent.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“Who’s wielding the sword, an ancient swordsman?”</p><p>Those in the front couldn’t see the situation at the back.</p><p>Those behind saw the young figure who suddenly drew his sword, already disintegrating into an afterimage on the spot.</p><p>“Who dares to launch a covert attack on me?!”</p><p>The great robed figure in the higher void cried out miserably, then turned in anger, looking towards the origin of the sword light, but felt a chill at the back of his head.</p><p>“Behind.”</p><p>At these words, he turned around in shock, his left arm bursting with blue thunder, not thinking as he viciously slammed it behind him:</p><p>“Forbidden·Thunder Hand!”</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Thunder, broken…</p><p>The remaining left arm struck the oncoming person in the chest, spun around weirdly a few times, grazed past the right eye, the forearm hitting his own chest, then the upper arm vibrated in the wrong direction and broke away, getting thrown…</p><p>“Ah—”</p><p>The armless figure in the great robe let out a pained, shrill howl.</p><p>The moment his wide mouth gaped open, the throat was clearly compressing a point of dark thunder energy.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Hate filled his eyes.</p><p>In this Divine Relic, no matter the consequences.</p><p>When he found himself in such a sorry state, the only possibility was being torn apart and devoured by others, naturally, he would want to take someone down with him before his death.</p><p>Also, in that split second, the energy in his throat hadn’t yet been released when the armless higher void figure felt that this young face looked somewhat familiar, especially those deep, profound eyes…</p><p>“Hum!”</p><p>Soul Reading.</p><p>Zhou Tianshen, Dark Forest, six God Fated Stars, Big Cloth Bag, covert attack, having children…</p><p>In that instant, everything became clear.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lowered his eyelids, shifted his gaze away, and the Soul Reading was cut off, without even an extra move of his hand…</p><p>“No—”</p><p>In that moment of distraction, the uncontrolled energy burst from his throat, the face of the armless higher void being surged with a panicked, horrified expression, but in the end, he couldn’t even shout an extraneous word…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A thousand miles high in the sky, dark thunder swept away.</p><p>Stars shattered, souls departed from the ruins.</p><p>Beneath that terrifying shriek, everyone’s eardrums bulged, eyes reddened, as they watched a higher void figure fall from having two arms, to one, to none, and then to death, all in an instant.</p><p>And across from him, the other person hadn’t even made a move.</p><p>“Crap!”</p><p>Around Xu Xiaoshou, the previously packed forest cleared surprisingly, forging a safety distance of about thirty feet all around him.</p><p>Within these Divine Relics, indeed there were many at the Cutting Path stage and higher voids everywhere, but such a death, self-destructing like a toy, was truly excessive!</p><p>“Who is this divine being?”</p><p>“The Divine? I heard The Divine has a big bald head, right?”</p><p>“His physique… no, he’s an ancient swordsman, just now that sword of his clearly…”</p><p>As the dust settles, the figure clad in black robes with a black sword and black hair, standing with a bowed head, revealing only a side of his face, looks calm, composed.</p><p>“Lord Shou?!”</p><p>No one knew who shouted first.</p><p>Then the entire pursuit army, as if their sealed memories were pried open, trembled in pain as pupils widened.</p><p>“Saint Servant Lord Shou, he’s here?”</p><p>“Damn! I knew it, who else possesses Ancient Sword Technique, such a sacred physique, and also has Spiritual Cultivation Holy Power, turns out…”</p><p>“Not true, was Xu Xiaoshou that strong? Wasn’t he being chased to near-death in Sky City, and then luckily took Senior Rao Yaoyao as his subordinate?”</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“What? Buddy, you, um, okay.”</p><p>“What’s wrong, just speak up!”</p><p>“What’s wrong? You ask what’s wrong? Did you really not know that Lord Shou tore apart The Holy Emperor Qilin with his own hands in the Central Yuan world?”</p><p>“Brother, that’s old news, Lord Shou has already attacked Jade Capital City; right now, he’s clearly fighting Hallmaster Xuanji outside of Jade Capital City…”</p><p>“Hallmaster Xuanji, what’s that?”</p><p>“Er, let’s just say Hallmaster Dao has defected from the sacred mountain, and currently Dao Xuanji is the incumbent…”</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>“Dao Xuanji is nothing, he’s died twice already, right now Lord Shou is fighting Sword Deity Bei Bei!”</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>“Wait, if Lord Shou is fighting Sword Deity Bei, who is this person here?”</p><p>“One Person Produces Thousands of Children, do you understand the value in that phrase?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“In Reverence, Passive Points +1886.”</p><p>“Being Analyzed, Passive Points +3445.”</p><p>“In Awe, Passive Points +4849.”</p><p>No need to repeat “silence” anymore!</p><p>As the scene fermented to its peak, when all voices fell into stillness, everyone stared at the person standing high in the air, wicked and extremely evil.</p><p>He was clearly younger than everyone present.</p><p>Even younger than their sons, grandsons.</p><p>Standing there, he became the focal point of the world, and everyone unconsciously followed him with their gaze.</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
