Yet tossed into the sea of people in the Divine Relics, they almost seemed to fade into obscurity.</p><p>Without a doubt, where there were many people, there were bound to be opportunities.</p><p>“Run, it’s the Dark Forest!”</p><p>A sudden cry of alarm rang out in the distance, the words somewhat slurred.</p><p>Before Xu Xiaoshou could ask any questions, while his “Perception” swept across all directions, he casually patted the shoulder of a blue-clothed middle-aged man who was squeezing his way forward, his head throbbing with the effort.</p><p>“Hello…”</p><p>“Get lost!” The irate man didn’t even turn his head, swinging his palm backward, “Don’t block my chance to seize the God Fated Star!”</p><p>Smack.</p><p>Thump thump thump…</p><p>Blood splattered.</p><p>Spiritual weapons shattered one after another.</p><p>Following that, a severed arm was flung up into the ashen sky.</p><p>“Ahh——”</p><p>The man’s heartrending scream turned into a look of terror on his face, “You, you, you…”</p><p>He simply couldn’t believe that his strike, enriched with the Cutting Path spiritual source, not only failed to knock the other aside.</p><p>The person in question hadn’t even moved. His three Void Protection Treasure Pearls shattered, those could block three fatal attacks from the higher void!</p><p>The protective arm was broken, and that was a third-grade spiritual weapon!</p><p>His hand had flown off, sent flying!</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>The middle-aged man shouted in shock, what kind of physique was this…a Body Technique? Did he practice ancient martial arts? Was he that renowned Supreme Sovereign, The Divine?</p><p>“In today’s world, is there still anyone who does not recognize me?”</p><p>The corners of Xu Xiaoshou’s lips turned up, revealing a trace of an evil smile.</p><p>How long has this big brother been disconnected from the world?</p><p>The more the middle-aged man looked at this unruly face, the more familiar it became, and before he could react…</p><p>Hum!</p><p>His head vibrated.</p><p>The man’s eyes turned white, his tongue lolled out from his mouth, convulsing as he collapsed onto the ground.</p><p>“Soul Reading!”</p><p>Indeed, within these Divine Relics, everyone was fighting for their own opportunities, so why bother with pleasantries?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt he had been constrained by the etiquette of the ancient swordsman, foolishly hoping to show some courtesy to these desperados.</p><p>Why trouble with questions?</p><p>If he wanted to know something, he could just look for himself.</p><p>In a brief moment, he had read the entire life of this man.</p><p>A Cutting Path Spiritual Cultivator of little merit, who had passed seven out of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity and didn’t dare to continue, had come to the Divine Relics in search of an opportunity.</p><p>He had plenty of treasures, having used many inside the ruins, so now he could only dare to hang behind the main force and chase after others.</p><p>But he didn’t know much…</p><p>He only knew there was someone named Zhou Tianshen ahead with a big cloth bag containing six God Fated Stars, and he hadn’t even seen what the bag looked like.</p><p>He had chased Zhou Tianshen for two days, following behind the hunting army, and preyed on the lives of thirteen spiritual cultivators, taking countless benefits, including a spatial ring from an injured person of the higher void.</p><p>“Got something.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou let out a wry smile, stepping over the middle-aged man’s chest and passing by, resulting in the man turning into starlight and being sent to the Ran Ming ruins.</p><p>“Dead…”</p><p>“He’s dead?”</p><p>The surrounding few people who were also squeezing their way forward, accidentally caught a glimpse of this scene out of the corner of their eyes, and their faces turned pale.</p><p>Cutting Path!</p><p>An encounter!</p><p>Without even exchanging a few words, they locked eyes and one was trampled to death?</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>The situation was somewhat chaotic; the people at the back wanted to push forward, and those in front seemed frightened and tried to move back, with both forces opposing each other.</p><p>The few who had witnessed the death at the Cutting Path were now stuck, unable to run away, they could only look blankly as they met that youth’s kind gaze.</p><p>“It wasn’t my fault!”</p><p>“I don’t know anything!”</p><p>“Young man, you look somewhat familiar… Ah, you are! Uh?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sneered as he glanced over, the last one, an old man with streaks of black among his white hair, evidently recognized who he was.</p><p>Too many bullfrogs in shallow water. Being of that age and only at the Sovereign Dao Realm, how could he even dare to vie for the chance of the God Fated Star?</p><p>Oh, he can’t die, that indeed makes it easy to join the fray…</p><p>He glanced around.</p><p>Soul Reading activated.</p><p>He didn’t spare a single one, all the green-faced strangers who didn’t practice soul arts collapsed on the ground, but regrettably, he was unable to find any useful information.</p><p>“No wonder they’re trailing behind the main force.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked up towards the front, pushing and shoving, the noise making it irritating.</p><p>“Quiet!”</p><p>He shouted loudly, his voice carrying Holy Power that spread in all directions.</p><p>Whether flying in the sky, on the ground, or burrowing beneath… they were all silenced in a moment, leaving the exterior of the Dark Forest in dead silence.</p><p>But it was only for a moment, then someone shouted again:</p><p>“Move back!”</p><p>“Don’t squeeze, there’s trouble ahead, dammit! I don’t want to go in!”</p><p>“Who’s shouting from behind? Get lost, all of you, or die!”</p><p>“Scorned, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyebrows rose as his “Perception” ascertained the situation, and he spotted a figure standing in the void at the distant horizon wrapped in a large robe – a silhouette of the higher void.</p><p>Indeed, compared to the worm-like beings below, this figure exuded an arrogant aura of someone accustomed to authority, with an attitude of absolute supremacy in his gaze.</p><p>Presumably, he must know more…</p><p>Without further hesitation, Xu Xiaoshou gripped Hidden Bitter, drawing the sword.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>In the crowded masses, a silver-white sword light instantly shot up towards the sky, shredding dozens of people in the vicinity.</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
