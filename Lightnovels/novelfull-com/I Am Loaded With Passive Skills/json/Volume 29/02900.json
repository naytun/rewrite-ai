Fugui!”</p><p>In the Apricot Realm, Yu Lingdi, where the Holy Divine Palace once stood.</p><p>The super-large City Lord Mansion, created with the Crystal Palace as its main structure, suddenly emitted a pig-slaughter-like roar.</p><p>Li Fugui’s hand trembled, and the blueprint fell to the ground.</p><p>“You guys carry on, Lord Shou has summoned me!”</p><p>“If I don’t return… bah, if I don’t come back shortly, you’re responsible for the construction of the City Lord Mansion.”</p><p>He tossed these few words to the earth and wood-type Spiritual Cultivation Engineers by his side and pointed towards a middle-aged man before vanishing like smoke.</p><p>The remaining few exchanged looks:</p><p>“Has something happened to Lord Shou?”</p><p>“Impossible, right? In the Apricot Realm, he is the owner. How could anything happen to him?”</p><p>“But how do you explain that wretched scream? By my guess, the injury is severe! Could it be that Hallmaster Dao struck?”</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Li Fugui appeared in the Crystal Palace in great urgency and quickly saw Lord Shou, who was clutching his neck, standing before the statue of the turtle with a stele on its back with an expression full of resentment.</p><p>Strictly speaking…</p><p>This was Lord Shou’s second true body!</p><p>By now, Li Fugui had learned quite a lot.</p><p>He understood the delicate relationship between this person in front of him and the true Lord Shou; they weren’t the same person, but they were as good as one, also being the key core of “One Person Produces Thousands of Children.”</p><p>“Lord Shou.”</p><p>Li Fugui walked over quickly; he had rarely seen such a grave expression on Lord Shou’s face.</p><p>With a thought, since danger was unlikely in the Apricot Realm, then…</p><p>“Something happened at the God Executioner’s Ruins?”</p><p>His people had not yet returned from the ruins to bring first-hand news, which meant something “big” must have occurred in real-time to Lord Shou himself.</p><p>The matter could be considered small or big depending on the view!</p><p>“I almost died.”</p><p>No sooner had the second true body spoken than Li Fugui’s expression changed drastically, his entire demeanor becoming more serious.</p><p>But seeing Lord Shou remove his hand from his neck, where there was actually not even a hint of a bruise, he narrowed his eyes and spoke in an unpleasant tone:</p><p>“To be precise, I was almost succeeded upon by an idiot, sent out of the Divine Relics…”</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>The surprise in Li Fugui’s eyes didn’t diminish.</p><p>Did this mean that someone almost managed to kill Lord Shou’s physical body?</p><p>His intelligence department had conducted tests; the “death” within the Ran Ming ruins was vaguely defined.</p><p>Those who hadn’t practiced the Dao of the soul would be “invited” out of the ruins upon the shattering of their physical bodies;</p><p>For those who had practiced the Dao of the soul, unless they specialized in it, their lingering lives would also be sped up once their physical bodies were destroyed, meaning they’d be “invited” out of the ruins instantly as well.</p><p>Only a higher void like Number One from Li Fugui’s team, who had abandoned her physical body and could still wander inside the ruins in her soul form, escaped this fate.</p><p>Yet, she was primarily a practitioner of the Dao of the soul on the Shengshen Continent and her body was merely for show.</p><p>Even so, once she was severely injured in a skirmish, her soul body was immediately “invited” to leave.</p><p>The Ran Ming ruins prioritized the physical body over the Dao of the soul, even over the soul itself… This was the conclusion Li Fugui could only come to, yet he was not certain about the extent of it.</p><p>As for extreme cases like ancient swordsmen’s soul bodies…</p><p>Ancient swordsmen were too rare!</p><p>Li Fugui didn’t even have one to test with.</p><p>So, he didn’t know about those like Lord Shou, who had strong physiques and could wield the Phantom Swords Technique with only a soul left, though their soul defenses might not be as strong.</p><p>If their body were gone, leaving only a soul body or even just an intent, would they be “invited” out immediately, or would there be special exceptions?</p><p>There was no answer.</p><p>But before entering the ruins, Li Fugui had already relayed this information to Lord Shou.</p><p>And what his First Pavilion in the Sky’s small intelligence department knew, the Holy Divine Palace side likely figured out as well.</p><p>Lord Shou had only just entered the Ran Ming ruins when he hastily called for him, with a face that suggested something significant had happened.</p><p>Li Fugui had a hunch, just by moving his toes, that he had been ambushed by Yue Gongli.</p><p>His physical body or soul had almost been destroyed.</p><p>But!</p><p>That raised a question!</p><p>Today, apart from the Ten High Nobles, who, besides Yue Gongli personally taking action, could break through Lord Shou’s nearly unhuman defenses?</p><p>Even if the theory stood, on the off chance, it was possible…</p><p>Lord Shou’s battle consciousness was unquestionable; a covert attack should have been impossible too!</p><p>“I don’t have time to explain too much to you.”</p><p>However, the second true body didn’t say anything superfluous and, furrowing his brows in recollection, his Drawing Expertise flung a thick line into the void, sketching a lifelike figure:</p><p>“Within ten breaths, I want all the information on this person!”</p><p>Just as he had wept in the Ran Ming ruins and his first body fought Bei Huai fiercely outside.</p><p>Now, with his first body carefree in the ruins and the second true body in the Apricot Realm, he still meant to enter seclusion, Death Seclusion.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed impulsive but was incredibly fond of his life.</p><p>With both consciousnesses focused on his first body’s single life, not to guard against someone from the Divine Relics or whether he’d be kicked out after death, he was guarding against Ran Ming.</p><p>What if it housed an evil god?</p><p>What if the legacy was just a fishing expedition?</p><p>If Dao Qiongcang could do such things, why couldn’t Ran Ming?</p><p>The second true body was his last line of insurance.</p><p>But there was no need to be as extreme as he had been in the Ran Ming ruins, no need to dig a pit to bury himself and wail.</p><p>All he needed was to stay in the Crystal Palace, granting him a bit of freedom while he had to stay vigilant for his first body at all times to prevent accidents.</p><p>For this reason, the second true body didn’t even go out to consult Li Fugui or Dragon Apricot about the Di Ying Holy Plant. He had resolved to be a shut-in.</p><p>And so…</p><p>The potential calamity he had guarded against at Ran Ming didn’t come to pass.</p><p>But ironically, he had stumbled upon an entirely different kind of unexpected event!</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
