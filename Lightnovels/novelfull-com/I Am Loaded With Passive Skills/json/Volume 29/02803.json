After a slight nod, he quickly left the Arena.</p><p>Feng Zhongzui felt liberated and blurted out:</p><p>“Everyone says the firmer the foundations of the Sovereign Dao Realm, the harder it is to cut through the Path, but Lord Shou seems to have comprehended the Upanishad…”</p><p>“Perhaps you don’t know, but after contracting a ghost beast…”</p><p>“Cough cough cough!” Feng Tingchen suddenly coughed violently.</p><p>Feng Zhongzui’s back chilled, and he went straight to the point: “Okay, the Upanishad Lord Shou comprehended is the legendary Life Upanishad! With such solid foundational roots and other attributes, can he really succeed in Cutting Path?”</p><p>No sooner had he spoken than…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>In the mirror of the Dao Imparting Mirror, Xu Xiaoshou, dressed in black, concentrated his gaze and, using intent as his sword, first struck at the illusory Body Dao Disc.</p><p>He indeed lacked experience in Cutting Path…</p><p>But did the first Spiritual Cultivator have experience?</p><p>Bazhun’an was right, if one must tread a new path, then no one else’s experience can be borrowed.</p><p>Upon deciding to embrace the moment of Cutting Path, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t want to hear others’ experiences or abide by old rules, only following the voice of his heart:</p><p>Cut the Path, cut the Path…</p><p>With intent as the blade, split straight through the foundational roots.</p><p>Without destruction, there is no establishment; without discarding, there is no achievement!</p><p>“Crack—”</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The Body Dao Disc shattered, turning into endless light points, merging into his body.</p><p>As expected, Xu Xiaoshou felt his body grow stronger… though compared to his already formidable base, this slight progress was minimal.</p><p>Very good.</p><p>The path was right.</p><p>The Path is meant to be cut this way!</p><p>But, something seemed off?</p><p>…</p><p>“Too too too… too violent!”</p><p>Holding the Dao Imparting Mirror, Feng Zhongzui suddenly stuttered and after a moment of shock exclaimed:</p><p>“Although I am an ancient swordsman, I have also seen Spiritual Cultivators in action!”</p><p>“Cutting Path in the Sovereign Dao Realm, is this how it’s done? Shouldn’t one sit and observe in silence, gradually melting away the foundational roots with enlightenment, and finally return to its true origins, gathering energy into oneself?”</p><p>“The harder the foundational roots, the more difficult they are to dissolve and digest, just like eating food that is too hard… the ‘cut’ in Cutting Path is only a figurative word, not a literal one, and now, has Lord Shou turned it literal?”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui was genuinely dumbfounded.</p><p>He couldn’t understand Spiritual Cultivation, but he could understand “intent.”</p><p>From the perspective of an ancient swordsman, he clearly saw that just then, an intangible sword condensed from intent above Lord Shou’s head split his foundational roots in two, then completely swallowed them!</p><p>This method was too fierce, too crude, and too extreme!</p><p>It wasn’t just him; countless Spiritual Cultivators in Jade Capital City, the ancient swordsmen with half-baked knowledge of Spiritual Cultivation, as well as demi-saints, nearly all found it hard to understand Xu Xiaoshou’s actions.</p><p>Even Upanishad demi-saint Ye Xiaotian seemed thoughtful, and those before the Dao Imparting Mirror from the five regions felt overwhelmed, completely baffled.</p><p>“He just easily cut through the first attribute of Spiritual Cultivation he perceived?”</p><p>“That’s it! It must be because that wasn’t the main attribute, it was just an additional one…”</p><p>Full of anticipation, everyone turned their gaze back to the Dao Imparting Mirror.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou struck with another sword.</p><p>This time, he aimed at the Spirit and Will Dao Discs.</p><p>“Crack crack…”</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>All shattered!</p><p>Feng Zhongzui’s hand trembled, his eyes wide, “Another success? Is it really because these are additional attributes, so Lord Shou can cut them effortlessly?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was also stunned.</p><p>He realized what was strange; the process was too smooth, smooth like he was dreaming.</p><p>Could I really be a genius?</p><p>With the three basic discs of Body, Spirit, and Will, even without having touched a Profound Dao Seed, Xu Xiaoshou knew his foundations were not lacking.</p><p>Not comparable to Spirit Division and Ye Xiaotian’s level of Upanishad, but when compared to the vast group of Spiritual Cultivators, surely it was above average?</p><p>And it was this easy to cut…</p><p>How could it be said that Cutting Path is so difficult among Spiritual Cultivators?</p><p>Things others find impossible, are done in one thought by me… damn, sword cuts the path?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paused briefly, then raised several Will Swords again, targeting the remaining several Great Dao Discs.</p><p>“Boom boom boom boom…”</p><p>One after another, swords passed and Dao collapsed!</p><p>Sword, Fire, Metal, Array, Method… utterly ruthless, all cleaved open by him.</p><p>“Even the Way of the Sword Disc was cut?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was certain his Way of the Sword Disc was not simple!</p><p>If all these could be cut, could only the Life Dao Disc possibly resist him a little?</p><p>He suspiciously raised another sword, aiming at the brilliant Life Dao Disc, attained in the realm of Upanishad, thinking go big or go home!</p><p>“Crack—”</p><p>This time, the Life Dao Disc resisted for quite some time, enduring for about ten breaths.</p><p>Countless Path Principles powder splintered out first, merging back into him bit by bit, until the entire Great Dao Disc cracked and collapsed, exploding into fragments…</p><p>It too was cut!</p><p>It too was digested!</p><p>This was absurd!</p><p>Cutting Path was freaking easier than taking off pants, who said it was hard? Stand up and face your death!</p><p>“Perception” swept through, and Xu Xiaoshou saw the gaping crowd around him and the shocked gazes from Jade Capital City.</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points +8544.”</p><p>“Begrudged, Passive Points +1.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
