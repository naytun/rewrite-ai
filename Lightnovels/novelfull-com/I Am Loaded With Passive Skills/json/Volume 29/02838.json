How has it happened again?”</p><p>A twitch appeared in Feng Tingchen’s eye as he watched the Feng family disciple silently.</p><p>.com</p><p>“Uh.” It was only then that Feng Zhongzui realized something and apologetically said, “Sorry, family head. Nowadays, whenever I shout, my hand feels uncomfortable if it isn’t grasping something…”</p><p>The spectators before the Five Domains Preaching Mirror, who had no time to criticize Feng Zhongzui’s words, were stunned by what followed after Lord Shou closed his eyes.</p><p>In the past, rumors had it that Kui Leihan could gain Penetrating Divine Senses upon closing his eyes, sitting cross-legged, and standing up on the Ten High Nobles’ arena.</p><p>People heard but never deeply believed it, as it seemed too mystical.</p><p>Now, they had heard and seen many such geniuses, but all of them came from the same person – Lord Shou!</p><p>Lord Shou, since his time in Jade Capital City…</p><p>The first time he closed his eyes, he grasped the Life Upanishad. The second time, he formed a perfect contract with a ghost beast. The third time, he had insights about space before Cutting Path. The fourth time, he executed the Fierce Sword Heavenly Unravel. The fifth time, he understood the spiritual sword technique. The sixth time…</p><p>It was too much!</p><p>His talent was terrifying to the point that every time he closed his eyes, he would gain something.</p><p>However, before he was “playing around” and never said anything before closing his eyes, but now he was requesting Feng Tingchen to transmit his gains to the five domains of the continent using the Dao Imparting Mirror…</p><p>“Gained a little insight?”</p><p>Everyone had a bad feeling about it.</p><p>Considering the deceptive nature of ancient swordsmen, could it be that Lord Shou had made a significant breakthrough after his battle with Li Fuyu?</p><p>“Hum…”</p><p>The Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation started to spin open beneath Xu Xiaoshou’s feet.</p><p>Li Fuyu caught a glimpse of it, and the power of Heavenly Abandon above it was nearly gone, but what quickly lit up were the never before seen new divine path patterns.</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>Li Fuyu swore he wasn’t mistaken; the divine path patterns were all new, and their growth was rapid and getting brighter!</p><p>Swish.</p><p>Mei Siren appeared in time, landing beside Gu Yu.</p><p>While gripping the Taicheng Sword and vigilantly guarding against the demi-saints surrounding Xu Xiaoshou, Mei Siren managed to whisper softly:</p><p>“He didn’t want you to speak first.”</p><p>Living up to such an age, who isn’t astute?</p><p>Looking at the young man who could have instant insights, Gu Yu’s feelings were complex.</p><p>Yes, some words, once spoken, can’t be taken back and must be acted upon with one’s life.</p><p>But young man, to what astonishing extent does your “little gain” need to reach to withstand an old man’s final “drive towards the Path”?</p><p>…</p><p>“Passive Points: 77446663.”</p><p>What degree is a “little gain”?</p><p>It’s comprehending two Upanishads to the point where the Passive Points can climb back, just around a million less than the highest peak!</p><p>Nearly eighty million Passive Points after fiercely battling twice, now to be added to the Way of the Sword Disc.</p><p>Following the naturally realized Life Upanishad after the contract with the ghost beast, the Spatial Upanishad understood after adding the Imitator and Ye Xiaotian’s Holy Blood, and another Way of the Sword Upanishad would be recklessly realized…</p><p>No, seventy-seven million allows for the reckless realization of ten Upanishads!</p><p>“Who says I, Xu Xiaoshou, am not a genius?”</p><p>“Even if Elder Dao the Flamboyant is watching me now, isn’t my breakthrough speed fast enough to be considered ‘reasonable’?”</p><p>“Can he still see through my misdirection and calculate that I can directly add points?”</p><p>Of course, Xu Xiaoshou knew that fooling Dao Qiongcang or even Dao Xuanji with the imitation of Demi-Saint’s blood was impossible.</p><p>But does that mean he should forgo misdirection?</p><p>No.</p><p>No matter how far-fetched, he still needed to maintain a facade to cover up his deepest secrets.</p><p>A person’s talent can be outrageous enough to become a demi-saint overnight, and people like Dao Qiongcang will even give a thumbs up because it is within their understanding.</p><p>But to urinate on the spot and become a Holy Emperor without reason, not to mention Dao Qiongcang coming at you with a knife for dissection, even the Five Great Holy Emperors would need to bow down and take a closer look at what kind of being you are.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou isn’t ready to incite the Holy Emperor’s true body.</p><p>He can fight against Holy Emperors, even to the point of exhaustion.</p><p>But it’s one concept for Holy Emperors to contemplate getting rid of him, and another for them to seek him out, extract his secrets, and then analyze them.</p><p>The former will send an intent incarnation to mess around when they think of it. But the latter, that’s an unrelenting pursuit!</p><p>And now, after fighting twice with two astounding ancient swordsmen and gaining “a little insight,” Xu Xiaoshou finally could start adding points legimately.</p><p>Moreover, he specifically wanted the people of the five domains to watch and witness the legend!</p><p>Field of Profound Dao, Profound Dao Seed, Way of the Sword Disc binding…</p><p>“Reckless!”</p><p>Upon planting the first seed, Xu Xiaoshou felt like he had arrived on his wedding night, lifting the so long awaited and patiently endured veil of the ultimate mystery.</p><p>“Way of the Sword Disc (18%).”</p><p>Good, starting with an “18%” progress, this is simply too… His thoughts froze, Xu Xiaoshou was taken aback.</p><p>Wait, why so little?</p><p>The inadequately perceived Space Dao Disc started at “15%”.</p><p>A Life Dao Disc piled up purely with passive skills, starting at “13%”!</p><p>After cultivating ancient sword technique for so long, shouldn’t the Way of the Sword Disc have a starting value of 50%, or at least 40%…</p><p>18%, what’s going on?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
