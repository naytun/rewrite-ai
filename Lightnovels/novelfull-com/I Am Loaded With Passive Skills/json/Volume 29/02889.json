But even after the battle with Hallmaster Dao ended and the chiefs of the six divisions had all shown up, he had never appeared.</p><p>“Nian…”</p><p>There was no one else with that name in his memory.</p><p>Based on the characteristics of the Divine Relics, this Nian could only be the one he remembered.</p><p>His name being on the Ancestral God Ranking proved that his strength was definitely not weak…</p><p>“Of course, the possibility that someone is raising a pig cannot be ruled out.”</p><p>“It’s even possible that it was Yue Gongli who raised this homegrown pig in advance for the final countermeasure.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou focused his spiritual senses and noticed that the name of this Nian quickly had a subtle beam of light descend upon a distant place.</p><p>Interestingly, that light seemed to overlap with Zhou Tianshen’s…</p><p>Zhou Tianshen again!</p><p>The eye of the storm in the Divine Relics, Zhou Tianshen?</p><p>“Nian, are you starting to kill pigs?” Xu Xiaoshou’s expression changed, though it seemed unlikely.</p><p>Anyone who wasn’t stupid, seeing those resounding names on the Ancestral God Ranking, should know that whoever could kill Zhou Tianshen would qualify to be the next pig.</p><p>This person had obtained a God Fated Star; other than receiving it upon entering the Divine Relics and getting on the rankings under extreme circumstances, anyone who could hold their ground for half a day was definitely not a fool.</p><p>So, what was he doing by Zhou Tianshen’s side?</p><p>Thinking further was fruitless; after analyzing the situation, Xu Xiaoshou already knew what his next step should be.</p><p>Undoubtedly three words…</p><p>…</p><p>“Wow! Stop chasing me already, you guys are really annoying!”</p><p>Zhou Tianshen’s sword swing enveloped in golden light merged with Holy Power, turned into an enormous tidal wave, pushing away thousands of people behind him.</p><p>Ma Ma…</p><p>Looking at the thousands of people on the ground, thousands in the air, and who knows how many beneath the earth—in a glance, a densely packed mass more disgusting than locusts, Zhou Tianshen was overwhelmed.</p><p>He never had claustrophobia, but he had contracted it these past few days, along with a new aggravating symptom—seeing people made him annoyed!</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Out of nowhere, a sword light heavily struck his neck.</p><p>Zhou Tianshen’s head tilted, clutching the Big Cloth Bag tightly; his whole body was thrown backwards.</p><p>During the flight, bright purple flames, Heavenly Thunder, Hidden Needles, Head-cutting Devices… among others, numerous element attacks and covert and overt attacks greeted him.</p><p>Zhou Tianshen forcefully broke free from inertia mid-air, dodging left and right, and ended up catching all of them without missing a single one.</p><p>“Sigh.”</p><p>After landing, all he had left was a long sigh.</p><p>“Pfft…”</p><p>Zhou Tianshen was fine, but the covert attacker from the demi-saints and higher void, spat out a mouthful of blood, looking enviously, jealously, and hatefully at the cloth bag he wouldn’t let go of.</p><p>The Big Cloth Bag was flashing brilliantly, clanging loudly; that surge of energy had just protected Zhou Tianshen.</p><p>Everyone knew it contained six head-sized God Fated Stars, but Zhou Tianshen thought he had disguised it well. After rolling on the ground and struggling to his feet, he still managed to shout with full vigor:</p><p>“The God Fated Stars are really not on my person. I’ve handed them over to Lord Shou already; do you even dare to provoke him?”</p><p>“He’s a malicious Saint Servant, a ruthless expert, it’s best if you don’t fall into his hands, otherwise… otherwise… you won’t have any good fruit to eat!”</p><p>Initially, people ridiculed Zhou Tianshen’s childish speech.</p><p>Now, the pursuers were all silent, filled with killing intent.</p><p>Clearly, to a group of middle-aged and elderly aspirants, this little guy’s threat sounded like a joke.</p><p>Lord Shou?</p><p>It didn’t matter if he was a father or a grandfather.</p><p>Now, even the king of heavens would have to come, as those were “God Fated Stars”!</p><p>“But brothers, we can’t break the defense of the God Fated Stars at all, how are we supposed to kill Zhou Tianshen?”</p><p>“Damn it, I’ve been part of this pursuit for three days now, managed to get my hands on him four hundred sixty-five times, any demi-saint would have been chopped into ten thousand pieces by me, yet every time I’m pushed away by the power of the God Fated Stars…”</p><p>“How did Zhou Tianshen improve so quickly, I’m almost tired to death, and he’s not only reached the Sovereign Dao Realm but also manifested Holy Power?”</p><p>“Didn’t you see how this damn guy has been cultivating? Whenever he’s tired or hungry, he just holds the God Fated Stars and gnaws at them wildly; could his cultivation breakthrough not be fast?”</p><p>“Six God Fated Stars, ah! It’s like heaven itself is feeding him, I’m so jealous!”</p><p>“Ah, Ran Ming, my God, is it really ‘God’s Fate, all beings are equal’? Why do I only feel intense mockery and malice?”</p><p>The pursuing army was endlessly complaining.</p><p>Zhou Tianshen kept running while foolishly burying his head in the Big Cloth Bag, wildly sniffing and sucking at it.</p><p>Those who were injured or lacking in vitality and vigor quickly recovered!</p><p>The God Fated Stars were too powerful.</p><p>These things granted him the safeguard of immortality, a blessing for the Child of Destiny, certainly also a reward for enduring amidst countless armies without dying!</p><p>But actually, only Zhou Tianshen knew that he had died once…</p><p>Four days earlier, after arranging with the pursuing army for everyone to rest together for one night—a gentleman’s agreement that you don’t chase me, and I won’t run.</p><p>Zhou Tianshen experienced a bit of peaceful happiness.</p><p>But when he was soundly asleep, he was awoken by a shock, his neck “sizzled” with blood, the Big Cloth Bag was cut open, and one of the God Fated Stars was lost.</p><p>That was the first time Zhou Tianshen “Met a Saint”!</p><p>Just as he looked up, before he could scold the attacker for secretly breaking the agreement and acting covertly, before he could demand the covert attacker to return the God Fated Star…</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p><p>Paragraph copied</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
