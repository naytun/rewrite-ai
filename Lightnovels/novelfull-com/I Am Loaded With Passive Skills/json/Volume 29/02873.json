Lord Cang Sheng indeed deserves the title ‘the strongest’ nowadays.”</p><p>“And this ‘strongest’, not only downwards, but even if compared with the other Ten High Nobles, is still appropriate.”</p><p>Have you lost your mind?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but look towards the distant Jade Capital City, suddenly wondering if letting Li Fugui be responsible for this area was a bit inappropriate.</p><p>Look, what he has turned the kid into — speaking without thinking!</p><p>But Li Fugui’s gaze did not waver.</p><p>He was originally in charge of internal affairs, and his long-term intelligence work had bred a meticulous personality — people can be killed indiscriminately, but words cannot be spoken carelessly.</p><p>Even though now he was in the Apricot Realm, seemingly cut off from the outside world…</p><p>In reality, with the Apricot Realm Master Seal given by Lord Shou, Li Fugui was practically a half Lord of the Apricot Realm.</p><p>He could completely open a mini channel for himself, allowing communication beads to connect to the outside, keeping the link unbroken.</p><p>Furthermore, how long had Jade Capital City been in the Apricot Realm?</p><p>How long had Li Fugui been in the Apricot Realm?</p><p>Lord Cang Sheng was not like Lord Shou who feels ages apart after a day of not seeing each other; how could he progress that quickly?</p><p>His latest intelligence would be good if it was updated a few months ago!</p><p>And just on this point, Lord Shou had just arrived at Jade Capital City, and Li Fugui had already analyzed it earlier, now just waiting for Lord Shou to ask; how could he possibly be vague!</p><p>“Then tell me about it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, seeing his confident demeanor, dug at his ear, indicating he was ready to start.</p><p>Li Fugui took a deep breath, “First, I must declare, I am forever a man of the First Pavilion in the Sky…”</p><p>“Just get straight to the point. I’m ready,” Xu Xiaoshou “heh” sarcastically, with a clap of his hand, “Alright! Now you are from the Holy Divine Palace; start!”</p><p>Li Fugui was speechless.</p><p>Lord Shou was still the same Lord Shou, too strong, always knowing what was on his mind.</p><p>“Alright, if I am now a man of the Holy Divine Palace, I have at least, but not limited to, the following strength assessments of Lord Cang Sheng.”</p><p>“One, Lord Cang Sheng is one of the Ten High Nobles, and among them, he is capable of fighting; this is basic.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded.</p><p>The Ten High Nobles, after all, he understood their weight.</p><p>If nothing else, it would start with the combat strength of a Holy Emperor and go from there.</p><p>“Two, in the Council of Ten, Lord Cang Sheng has always been only responsible for logistics, but not the kind of logistics I manage… He is responsible for oversight, but not needing to exert force and not being able to exert force, are two different concepts.”</p><p>“Lord Shou, you should know, a hallmaster, two chiefs, three emperors, four divine oracles. Now the hallmaster has fled, one chief is in the ruins, Old Gou has defected, one of the four divine oracles has died, one is lazing around, one stays at home, one plots rebellion…” Li Fugui stuck to the old system because the newcomers were a joke.</p><p>“What rebellion?” Xu Xiaoshou frowned.</p><p>“Oh, one is about to defect to the light…” Li Fugui quickly corrected himself and was too lazy to argue that he was now a man of the Holy Divine Palace, “The remaining three emperors: Hallmaster Xuanji is useless, Wei Feng has left, and finally there’s Lord Cang Sheng, Elder Zhong was right, he must come forward to preside over the overall situation!”</p><p>For the sake of Passive Points, the scenes of battles outside were constantly being transmitted over the skies of Jade Capital City.</p><p>Thus, including the words Elder Zhong deliberately reminded of just now, Li Fugui knew all about it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou listened silently, nodding.</p><p>Li Fugui had sorted it out clearly, and he understood it clearly as well.</p><p>Just buff it up then; he must step out from behind the scenes to the forefront, and probably comes with towering rage.</p><p>“Three, among the Ten High Nobles, discussing neither personal goals nor future plans, only the current state.”</p><p>“Kui Leihan is constrained by his daughter and the weapon prohibition order, Bazhun’an fell below the Acquired Stage, Moonless Sword Deity’s endeavors are massive yet he struggles to take a step, and The Divine is trapped in the Cross Corner Street of the City of the Dead Bodhisattva.”</p><p>“The only news of the Buddha is a ‘inverted pagoda’, I can only offer a negative status speculation; the Holy Emperor of Bei Clan is too insane and is limited by the other four Great Holy Emperor Families, keeping a balance of power.”</p><p>“The rest, in the most perfect state, the least restricted, was originally one, now it’s two.”</p><p>Li Fugui paused, his expression serious, “The missing Hallmaster Dao and the perpetually charging up Lord Cang Sheng!”</p><p>“Oh, it’s three.” Another pause, he added, “Aunt Xiang’s state is also very perfect.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang might as well not be mentioned…Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his chin, sinking into deep thought:</p><p>Such a Lord Cang Sheng!</p><p>It was evident, Li Fugui had prepared thoroughly and for a long time.</p><p>What he provided was far more numerous and accurate than what one could blindly guess, and his definition of Lord Cangsheng was also more precise.</p><p>Not only that, he went into details about Old Gou, You Yuan, Bei Huai…</p><p>“Old Gou.” Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts drifted elsewhere.</p><p>“Yes.” Li Fugui was like a worm in Lord Shou’s stomach, seeing him in contemplation, he immediately said without hesitation:</p><p>“Lord Shou should also be aware, to ordinary people, a demi-saint is a demi-saint, and a Holy Emperor is a Holy Emperor, these are two higher realms.”</p><p>“But for the Ten High Nobles, a demi-saint is included in Holy Emperor, akin to the Sovereign Stage of the Dao realm.”</p><p>“The tenth level Holy Emperor isn’t cultivated, it’s charged up to!”</p><p>He cited an example: “Others sanctify…seal a demi-saint, like they’re tired from climbing a mountain, must stop halfway up the mountain to catch their breath.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
