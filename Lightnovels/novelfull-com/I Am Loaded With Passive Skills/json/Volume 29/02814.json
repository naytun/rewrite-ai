He’s Lord Shou, the one who just cut down Hallmaster Xuanji, the one who defeated Sword Deity Bei Bei!”</p><p>“A person like him, even if he is being pretentious, if he is willing to stoop down to shine my shoes… No! I don’t need him to polish them, if he says a word, I’d follow him right away.”</p><p>“I’m convinced! This is Lord Shou? Famous sights are less imposing than their reputations, but to see him in person is even more impressive!”</p><p>Thud—</p><p>Atop Jade Capital City, Zhong Yuanzi felt as if the world had lost all color and sound.</p><p>His tender heart felt as if it had been hammered fiercely, causing his heartbeat to skip.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Fang Wenxin yelled.</p><p>Seeing the “naive” explosion-haired person reacting like this, he felt his hair stand on end, scared half to death.</p><p>If Zhong Yuanzi were to go, it wouldn’t just be Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe losing an Elemental Divine Envoy, but the continent gaining a bomb-throwing god of death!</p><p>But just as he thought to speak again…</p><p>The explosion-haired person turned his head, with sincerity and earnestness, said, “If it’s for the sake of Jade Capital City, who but I should make the sacrifice?”</p><p>“No! It can’t—” Before Fang Wenxin could speak, from the distant Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, an ethereal and indignant voice descended.</p><p>“Dao Xuanji?!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stood up abruptly, glaring in the direction of the sacred mountain, “Cowardly turtle, if you have the guts, come out and talk, just shouting ‘impossible’ from a distance, what kind of hallmaster are you?”</p><p>How could Dao Xuanji possibly appear?</p><p>Inside the Saint Hall, when she received the emergency report, she was scared out of her wits.</p><p>Did she ever think Xu Xiaoshou was as deep as the sea, taking advantage of the sacred mountain’s emptiness to attack was one thing, but to think of abducting a demi-saint as well?</p><p>Jade Capital City is big, but isn’t an Elemental Divine Envoy with all the attributes more tempting?</p><p>“Elder Zhong must not listen to that thief…”</p><p>“Ah—”</p><p>Before Dao Xuanji could finish, Xu Xiaoshou interrupted with a roar, drawing the Fourth Sword and pointing angrily at the sacred mountain, his black hair wildly scattered:</p><p>“Dao Xuanji, if you dare influence Elder Zhong’s choice, I swear today I will turn this vast Jade Capital into a river of blood, with a million bodies lying prostrate!”</p><p>At this declaration, everyone around was horrified.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing almost laughed, although he had only met Xu Xiaoshou a few times, he knew that Xu Xiaoshou could never truly do something like that, yet how did this guy become more and more childlike in his actions…</p><p>However, he soon couldn’t laugh anymore.</p><p>Because when a person often acting like a child possessed the combat strength to destroy the world, even if it was just a threat, it was astoundingly effective.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>No sooner had Xu Xiaoshou’s words settled, than a heaven-wide aura of slaughter almost solidified into substance, they overshadowed Jade Capital City, stirring up a blizzard of snow.</p><p>The people inside the city didn’t dare gamble, they were nearly driven mad, clutching their heads and screaming:</p><p>“Old witch Xuanji, get out of here!”</p><p>“We don’t want you, please don’t come here, we’re begging you, let Elder Zhong choose for himself, Hallmaster Xuanji, you really shouldn’t show up… don’t bother.”</p><p>“I want to live, I want to survive, aaaaah—”</p><p>“Old granny, step back, Elder Zhong, save us!”</p><p>In the Saint Hall, when the saint’s will transmitted the terror and fear from the whole city, as if she herself was the demon.</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s head went “buzz,” and then everything went blank.</p><p>It’s not…</p><p>How?</p><p>Why?!</p><p>In just a few days, did the tide of Jade Capital City completely fall under his, Xu Xiaoshou’s, control?!</p><p>In an instant, Dao Xuanji’s pupils dilated with shock.</p><p>To be slain twice was not likely, but what was frightening was, given the small size of Jade Capital City compared to the vastness of the five regions, had she, Dao Xuanji who had just assumed the post, been brought down by that young man she previously looked down on?</p><p>When the time comes, even if Ai Cangsheng could return and reverse the situation…</p><p>“Can my authority be restored?”</p><p>Dao Xuanji gripped the black dragon throne’s armrest tightly.</p><p>It seemed she finally saw clearly why Xu Xiaoshou, seemingly unnecessarily, blustered and raged on top of Jade Capital City.</p><p>This guy, his plans were on the third floor…</p><p>…</p><p>Above Jade Capital City, Elder Zhong was in a tough position.</p><p>On one hand, there was Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, which he had served as a tribute for half his life, to say he had no feelings for it would be a lie.</p><p>On the other hand, there was Xu Xiaoshou, whom he hadn’t known for long, but shared his convictions, willing to give up the whole Jade Capital City, even willing to lower his proud stance, all for the sake of inviting him…</p><p>Speaking truthfully, Zhong Yuanzi hadn’t been moved by anything in his life, but was truly touched just now.</p><p>He wasn’t just a scholar.</p><p>He also had his worldliness and could see that Xu Xiaoshou’s actions just now were partly an act, and not a small part at that.</p><p>But in his lifetime, who had ever wiped his shoes for him? Even if those shoes had long been engraved with a no-dust array…</p><p>Elder Zhong really liked Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Not just his scholarship, his all attributes, his Great Path Diagram, Zhong Yuanzi also really liked his personality.</p><p>But could he agree?</p><p>All over Jade Capital City, they watched the hesitant demi-saint Zhong Yuanzi, the tension palpable.</p><p>Spiritual Cultivators from the five regions looking at the silent, explosive-haired man in the mirror were dumbfounded.</p><p>At first, everyone thought Xu Xiaoshou’s desire to dig out Elder Zhong in front of the public was a joke…</p><p>Now!</p><p>Dao Xuanji was being restrained!</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi was hesitating!</p><p>Has the world gone mad? A Saint Servant publically poaching from the Holy Divine Palace, and might even succeed?</p><p>But until now…</p><p>As people recalled every act of Lord Shou since his arrival in Jade Capital City, they found each action illogical, even absurd!</p><p>Yet in the end, was Lord Shou about to get his wish?</p><p>Over and over again, countless people tried to imitate Lord Shou, analyzing his motives, to see if there was any “meticulous planning” behind them…</p><p>In the end, they realized they couldn’t understand!</p><p>Finally, someone murmured in awe, “Lord Shou is too terrifying…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
