Fifty-four Sword Steps, unsolvable in ancient times, remains unsolvable today. This is the Sword God’s sword technique, gentlemen!”</p><p>“Lord Shou’s defense is there for all to see—talk as they may about limiting the fight to the Ancient Sword Technique, Lord Shou is playing by the rules. But his Forged Body, that’s a passive enhancement!”</p><p>“His physique is not like ordinary ancient swordsmen; I fear even the sacred physique of a common demi-saint would not compare. Such defensive power was broken by the fourth kill… the fifth kill! Both broken by Li Fuyu!”</p><p>Amidst the chaotic emotions, Feng Zhongzui clutches his head and wails, “One can only imagine, had it been an ordinary person, they would have been killed to the point of leaving no bones behind!”</p><p>…</p><p>Noisy!</p><p>So noisy!</p><p>Too noisy!</p><p>This was the first time Xu Xiaoshou found Feng Zhongzui’s voice so grating that he wished he could slap it away.</p><p>But…</p><p>Boom boom boom boom boom boom!</p><p>The sixth kill! Six Traceless Sword Lights attacked from all directions, their rhythms entirely chaotic and unpredictable.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s body swayed, and even the Recoil seemed hard to affect him, nearly stumbling before managing to steady his stance.</p><p>“How…”</p><p>But the six swords had already struck one after another.</p><p>Fifty-four Sword Steps, already killing into the rhythm.</p><p>Without any delay, the first sword of the seventh kill followed closely, with the subsequent six swords hot on its heels…</p><p>Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stumbled, pierced back and forth by the Traceless Sword Light—going from being struck to being controlled.</p><p>This kill is not yet over…</p><p>“The Eighth Kill!” Feng Zhongzui roared:</p><p>“There are already two Traceless Sword Lights coming at different rhythms. The Fifty-four Sword Steps…”</p><p>“It seems I see the end? The Ancient Sword Steps, unlimited piercing?”</p><p>With each kill, another sword is added!</p><p>At this moment, the world watching from the five regions was completely shocked by this so-called sword technique of the former Sword God.</p><p>Everyone could imagine, when these fifty-four kills progressed over time to the tenth kill, the twentieth kill… and even to the fortieth or fiftieth kills.</p><p>If one could perform them all, wouldn’t there be dozens, if not hundreds of sword lights piercing simultaneously in an instant?</p><p>And if each successive sword is stronger than the last, who could withstand the sword lights after thirty or fifty kills?</p><p>“No Sword, Intangible, Path, Method…”</p><p>“Aura, control, rhythm, initiative…”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui not only saw the supreme application of the Swordless Technique within the battle, he also saw the intangible other elements, “Continuing this way, Lord Shou will surely fall. The only way to break the Ancient Sword Steps, truly, there is only one, just that one!”</p><p>Indeed.</p><p>There is only one.</p><p>In everyone’s mind, they simultaneously remembered the most primitive method of breaking it that Feng Zhongzui had mentioned while Li Fuyu was unsheathing his sword—better to be a broken piece of jade than an intact pottery shard!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought the same.</p><p>“Unless I activate the Ultimate Giant and let her kill to her heart’s content until she’s exhausted and gives up on her own…”</p><p>“The only possibility left is to launch the strongest counterattack as soon as Li Fuyu strikes the first sword; otherwise, the longer it drags on, even the strongest swordsmanship might not be able to be executed…”</p><p>Unwilling to break the rules of the duel of ancient swordsmen, Xu Xiaoshou simply couldn’t bet on Li Fuyu’s body being able to endure until which kill.</p><p>Because by the time the sword light of the ninth kill arrived, he was already pierced through the chest and back, his wounds a bloodied mess!</p><p>“Dao Penetration, Mo Sword Technique, Transmit, Shock Path, Six Paths, Instantaneous Style…”</p><p>Stepped down on the Way of the Sword Disc and merged into the Unity of Man and the Heavens state, Xu Xiaoshou was able to analyze a vast amount of Way of the Sword knowledge in an instant.</p><p>It was the combination of these 3000 Sword Styles that formed the Ancient Sword Steps’ superb attack and intangible tracelessness.</p><p>And each kill, each sword, in an instant, could stack various applications of sword techniques, layer by layer weakening the enemy’s defense.</p><p>This is what it means to be an ancient swordsman!</p><p>The utmost crazed attacker, the embodiment of attack power!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou never imagined that Li Fuyu, with just one form of swordsmanship and without any defenses, could break through his own defenses and even injure him to this extent!</p><p>Sword scars added to his body.</p><p>Sword techniques even more deeply branded into his heart.</p><p>He couldn’t wait any longer; after experiencing dozens of strikes of the Fifty-four Sword Steps and getting an overall analysis,</p><p>the rest could only be extrapolated later; with the aid of the Sword Disc, he was not afraid of failing to complement or penetrate them.</p><p>Now…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not want to lose.</p><p>Even if the Ancient Sword Technique was just one among the many cultivation systems he practiced and wasn’t close to one-tenth of his combat strength, he did not like to lose.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>As his scapula took a direct hit and flesh flew, the wounds on his chest were already more or less repaired.</p><p>Capitalizing on his good physical condition, Xu Xiaoshou forcibly steadied himself at a moment when he should have been stumbling, erecting the Flame Python.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>Amidst the surging sword light of the Fifty-four Sword Steps and beneath the snowstorm, the splendid Power Upanishad Formation suddenly unfolded.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui, holding the Dao Imparting Mirror, took a startled step back, then retreated further, staying clear of the Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation’s coverage.</p><p>“The second realm?”</p><p>“Lord Shou, can you still fight back?!”</p><p>…</p><p>I’m sorry.</p><p>I’m not just an ancient swordsman; I possess an array of passive skills.</p><p>Ordinary people, after missing the first kill, find it hard to mount any counterattack and even after being controlled, can’t manage to “break rather than bend.”</p><p>I have a high margin for error, so high that even after watching forty-five swords and learning from them, I can still rebel at your tenth kill!</p><p>“Heart Sword Technique…”</p><p>Sword lights crisscrossed as suddenly, Taoist music transformed.</p><p>At the sound, the Nine Major Sword Techniques of the Nine Heavens suddenly came to a halt.</p><p>It seemed even Li Fuyu was stunned, not expecting that Xu Xiaoshou, struggling under her onslaught, could still move and strike with his sword!</p><p>The ancient swordsmen present at the scene, and everyone in front of the Five Domains Preaching Mirror, lost sight of the famed sword Flame Python.</p><p>Next, they lost sight of Lord Shou, Zhu Jian…</p><p>In their ears, only this resonant, soul-shaking, ethereal sound remained:</p><p>“Nine Swords of Chaos, Supreme Heart Technique at my command.”</p><p>“In the realm of imagination, every illusion bows as a humble servant.”</p><p>“Sinking in body and mind, burdened by scattered thoughts with no respite.”</p><p>“One thought divine, another thought devoid of wisdom.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
