Using Ancient Sword Steps first, then Heavenly Abandon?</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“She was holding back…”</p><p>“Was it really a teaching match?”</p><p>Realizing this, Xu Xiaoshou was both annoyed and amused.</p><p>Fortunately, he wasn’t exactly chasing after “winning” as an outcome, the process of understanding the second stage of the No Sword Arts was even more precious.</p><p>But this certainly didn’t mean Xu Xiaoshou liked to fail!</p><p>With his feet on the Way of the Sword Disc, in a state of Unity of Man and the Heavens, while undergoing Heavenly Abandon, Xu Xiaoshou had grasped what true “emptiness” was.</p><p>He also realized the reason why he could never find Li Fuyu’s whereabouts under Ancient Sword Steps:</p><p>“Supreme!”</p><p>Li Fuyu’s sword did not depend on the “Great Path of Nothingness.”</p><p>She built it directly on the genuine “nothingness” outside the Great Path, the “Supreme” that is not of this realm.</p><p>On such a lofty foundation…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou still tried to find her through the Way of Heavens, the Way of the Sword, and so on.</p><p>It was as if he were trying to locate Li Fuyu in the Shengshen Continent while inside the White Cave, utterly impossible!</p><p>But does that mean the position of “Heavenly Abandon” is higher than “Wisdom is Emptiness”?</p><p>Absolutely not!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s “Perception” focused on the descending white sun of the Heavenly Abandon Upanishad array diagram…</p><p>Those trying to transcend the Way of Heavens, to transcend this realm, if not becoming Gods and Ancestors, would inevitably get lost.</p><p>Li Fuyu had certainly not reached the realm of the Ancestral God, nor was she powerful enough to create a Third Realm.</p><p>Therefore, she still needed to establish a connection with the Great Path Principles of the Shengshen Continent, leaving an anchor.</p><p>Hence, the “white sun” came into being!</p><p>The white sun was not the source of Heavenly Abandon, but it could act as its source.</p><p>The white sun was not Supreme, yet it could stand for Supreme.</p><p>Because if that white sun were extinguished, Li Fuyu would become like a kite with its string cut, lost outside of this realm.</p><p>“Heart Sword Technique, Wisdom is Emptiness.”</p><p>The Flame Python once again gathered its power for a drawn sword strike.</p><p>This time, not seeking the extreme in attack, it only gathered all the remaining power after being abandoned by Heavenly Abandon and struck towards that white sun.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The crumbling Imaginary Divine Country suddenly shrank, and that white sun was detained within it.</p><p>The intangible sword light of Wisdom is Emptiness swept out again, the white sun swelled suddenly, about to be erased…</p><p>But at the same time!</p><p>Just as Xu Xiaoshou realized why Li Fuyu had put her weight behind that one sword strike, all the power of Heavenly Abandon also suddenly surged to the Way of the Sword Upanishad array diagram under his feet.</p><p>“Chi Chi…”</p><p>In an instant, the intricate divine path patterns within Xu Xiaoshou’s Upanishad array diagram dissipated by a tenth or two.</p><p>“What the hell? Heavenly Abandon, abandoning my Way of the Sword Disc… No, Upanishad array diagram?” Xu Xiaoshou was astounded, truly a Sword Maniac, that battle consciousness… perfect!</p><p>His Wisdom is Emptiness, the intensity inevitably dropped quite a bit.</p><p>Yet, the white sun representative of the “Supreme” was still erased by almost half with a single sword strike.</p><p>This led to the weakening of the power of Heavenly Abandon associated with Xu Xiaoshou’s Upanishad array diagram underfoot.</p><p>Therefore, the power of Wisdom is Emptiness was able to continue consuming the Supreme.</p><p>Therefore, the power of Heavenly Abandon could only continue to erode the array diagram.</p><p>And so…</p><p>And…</p><p>A vicious cycle!</p><p>The scene fell into a deadlock.</p><p>Both second-stage powers were meant to be a sword strike that obliterated everything, separating life from death in the blink of an eye, instantly taking control.</p><p>Under the reactions of Xu Xiaoshou and Li Fuyu, their further reactive responses, and follow-up reactions, they turned into a sustained force, caught in a stalemate of mutual consumption.</p><p>The laymen watching around the Dao Imparting Mirror couldn’t understand at all.</p><p>In fact, not just them, even Feng Zhongzui outside was a bit confused at this moment.</p><p>He wasn’t skilled in Heart Sword Technique, nor No Sword Arts; he hadn’t seen Wisdom is Emptiness, and he had never seen Heavenly Abandon either—utterly unable to commentate.</p><p>As the fight reached this level, after holding it in for quite a while, he had nothing to say.</p><p>When he felt that the power of Heavenly Abandon was weakening and his voice could carry again,</p><p>he took out a gourd from his ring and chugged a few mouthfuls, then squeezed out two words:</p><p>“So… strong…”</p><p>Compared to the somewhat green Feng Zhongzui.</p><p>Feng Tingchen, Mei Siren, and others, however, showed astounded faces, unable to hide their shock as they watched the battle.</p><p>Feng Zhongzui turned his eyes and flashed over to Master Siren with the Dao Imparting Mirror in hand, “Master Siren…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
