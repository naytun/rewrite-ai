When I was nothing, it was just a ninth-grade spiritual sword…”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui’s eyes immediately brightened, realizing Lord Shou was about to tell the story of his relationship with his saber.</p><p>This was huge news; all previous attempts to uncover it paled in comparison to hearing it straight from the person involved!</p><p>Considering the three consecutive battles against the Sword Deities, Lord Shou was bound to become famous throughout the world.</p><p>The secrets of his earliest saber, Hidden Bitter, once revealed to the world, were also sure to stir a major uproar.</p><p>Thus, the Dao Imparting Mirror shifted focus from the Number One Sword Deity Elder Gu and zoomed in on Lord Shou and his black sword, enlarging every pit and dent on the sword body.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said a few words to Elder Gu that stirred a lot, with quite some emotion:</p><p>“During my unawakened days in the Spirit Palace, my talent was indeed mediocre, just like everyone else’s. I couldn’t master even the first move of the White Cloud Sword Technique, Fleeting White Clouds, despite three years of practice.”</p><p>“And the most valuable asset I possessed was this ninth-grade spiritual sword named ‘Hidden Bitter,’ symbolizing the idea that if one could hide all past hardships, perhaps a turn of fate might be welcomed?”</p><p>Saying this, Xu Xiaoshou’s mood darkened, sinking into that boring, isolated, and lightless white hospital room.</p><p>He paused for a few moments, then added:</p><p>“I also went into seclusion.”</p><p>“I struggled desperately for a spot in the Windcloud Competition of the Outer Yard.”</p><p>“I told myself that this was my last chance. If not successful, then I would die trying!”</p><p>“Actually, I failed…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled, lifting his head and looking at Mei Ziyu, then glancing at Elder Gu, and finally, his gaze returned to Hidden Bitter.</p><p>Hidden Bitter seemed to empathize with its owner’s despondent mood, daring not to whine too loudly, instead making comforting noises.</p><p>Suddenly it tensed up again, curling and releasing sharp sword energy, about to affectionately pierce his owner’s heart.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grasped the broken sword, shaking his head as he laughed:</p><p>“I have died once.”</p><p>“Or perhaps more than once.”</p><p>“But in this world, who hasn’t died a few times?”</p><p>He looked towards Elder Gu. “Fate led us to this day, so there’s no need to cling to the past. Letting go is easier, isn’t it?”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui was startled.</p><p>Mei Siren startled.</p><p>All spectators across the five regions were equally taken aback, feeling as though Lord Shou’s words contained much, yet none could comprehend.</p><p>Gu Yu thoughtfully looked at Hidden Bitter, not expecting this short-lived sword to have such a dense story.</p><p>But in the end, he only mentioned Mei Ziyu, affirmatively saying:</p><p>“Yes, Xu Xiaoshou, letting go indeed makes things easier.”</p><p>“But if living is like being close to death, why not push it further at the end and see if we can break free from these shackles and constraints?”</p><p>“As you said…” Gu Yu steadily watched, lifting his sword as if to hand it forward, and said:</p><p>“If not successful, then die trying?”</p><p>So, does everyone live under strict rules, desperately striving to escape like trapped beasts?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked up at the sky without saying more, raising his sword to meet Elder Gu’s.</p><p>Whoosh…</p><p>An intangible Sword Intent spread.</p><p>From the battlefield came two eager voices, unrelated to self, solely honoring the names of their swords:</p><p>“Mei Ziyu, challenges the fight!”</p><p>“Hidden Bitter, challenges the fight!”</p><p>The spectators in front of the Dao Imparting Mirror immediately erupted.</p><p>Feng Zhongzui clutched at the mirror, struggling to contain his excitement, and said:</p><p>“The third battle of the Seven Sword Deities, not for their personal glory, but staking their sabers’ reputations on the line?”</p><p>He wasn’t the only one to see it—surrounding the battlefield, all the ancient swordsmen understood Gu Yu and Xu Xiaoshou’s intentions:</p><p>The outcome didn’t matter; after this battle, Mei Ziyu and Hidden Bitter were sure to become famous!</p><p>After the swords clashed, Elder Gu took the lead in stepping back, not immediately making a move, but laughing aloud and saying:</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I know you’ve ‘learned a little.’ I won’t embarrass myself too much.”</p><p>“Throughout my life, I’ve fought countless battles and also lived in seclusion; I’ve had epiphanies in battle and felt inspired by the countryside, even creating a sword technique and reaching several realms myself…”</p><p>Gu Yu softened his smile, his expression turning solemn:</p><p>“I will make only three sword strikes, please enlighten me!”</p><p>“If you withstand them, I willingly support you in ascending to become one of the Seven Sword Deities and will be at your disposal henceforth.”</p><p>“If not, after the battle you shall withdraw and return to Jade Capital City, with a promise to stay away for at least a month, how does that sound?”</p><p>Hearing this, Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows, a hint of mockery in his voice, “I wouldn’t presume to instruct, but Elder Gu… this kind of bet puts me at a disadvantage.”</p><p>“Hahahaha!”</p><p>Gu Yu laughed heartily and shook his head. “No, you won’t be at a disadvantage. Even if you’ve ‘learned a little,’ from battling with me, your gains will be immense!”</p><p>“Fine!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou readily agreed, too lazy to haggle any further.</p><p>He was eager to see just what this so-called elder was capable of, daring to speak so grandly after he had revealed his real Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
