Together, we will be invincible under heaven.'”</p><p>After a pause, Ai Cangsheng gazed vacantly at the sky of the Saint circle, “I have been watching for over thirty years…”</p><p>Xi, Beibei, and others peeked out from behind the pillar, feeling like the atmosphere wasn’t so tense anymore?</p><p>Dao Xuanji opened her mouth but ended up saying nothing.</p><p>Updated by ℕovG○.co</p><p>She really couldn’t understand Ai Cangsheng’s words, and he probably hadn’t finished…</p><p>“For thirty years, like a single day, I never closed my eyes for a moment, because I was protecting the people of the world.”</p><p>“During the time he tricked me into the ruins, I had no idea what kind of accident had occurred in the five regions. Even so, I knew his purpose.”</p><p>“God slayer, the realm of the Ten Ancestors… As long as one enters the ruins and gathers the eighteen God Fated Stars, one can get the Ancestral God Fate Chart.”</p><p>“He didn’t dare take the risk, and of course, the Ancestral God Fate Chart couldn’t fall into the various dark factions, especially into the hands of the Saint Servants. Naturally, I would take the risk.”</p><p>“Also, as long as I acquired the Ancestral God Fate Chart and returned, no matter what changes occurred in the five regions, I could suppress them with a flip of my palm.”</p><p>Gazing at the broken sky of the Saint Hall, Ai Cangsheng lowered his head to look at the biggest frog in the well and said calmly,</p><p>“Gone.”</p><p>Xi felt a chill at the back of his head.</p><p>Updated by NovG○.co</p><p>He did not quite understand.</p><p>But what Lord Cangsheng meant to express was not that he had finished speaking but that he had lost something very important…</p><p>“What do you mean?” Dao Xuanji frowned, no longer insisting that Ai Cangsheng put down the bow, just let him aim.</p><p>“I said, it’s gone.”</p><p>“What’s gone?”</p><p>“Everything’s gone.”</p><p>Dao Xuanji couldn’t hold back any longer, “Clarify your words!”</p><p>With the bow drawn like a full moon and the arrow nocked, Ai Cangsheng truly wanted to release his hold, but looking at his mentally not-so-quick sister, he was instead amused.</p><p>“Still don’t understand?” After raising his eyebrows, he said with a wry smile,</p><p>“While you were still struggling for power and position on Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, a group of people were thinking about sealing divinity and claiming to be ancestors.”</p><p>“When you successfully seized the position of Hallmaster, but at the same time gifted others with a double victory, that group of people began to take action, fighting for godhood and ancestry.”</p><p>“I could choose not to enter the Ran Ming ruins and then decide whether to destroy the ruins or the person trying to acquire the Ancestral God Fate Chart when it was about to be taken.”</p><p>“Or I could directly enter the Ran Ming ruins, in which case The Divine, Cao Yihan, Bazhun’an, Kong Yuhen, including Bei Huai… none of them, even if I don’t succeed, could possibly succeed.”</p><p>With a smile, Ai Cangsheng looked at his exceptionally intelligent sister and said further,</p><p>“I was halfway through when you summoned me out, saying that Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe had undergone a change and claimed that it was Hallmaster Dao’s command.”</p><p>“I thought Hallmaster Dao had some brilliant insight, letting me enter the game and then pulling me out midway. Turns out ‘Hallmaster Dao’ now means this.”</p><p>“After I returned, I thought you were playing a joke on me, saying that Jade Capital City was gone, that demi-saints had died… How absurd? I was actually hoping this joke was true, that you were still Dao Qiongcang, and you were teasing me, but it turned out you were really teasing me.”</p><p>“Good, now you also think I’m joking with you, and that my Evil Sin Bow is just a toy bow… Well, you can keep thinking that way.”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng tightened the string of the Evil Sin Bow and aimed at Dao Xuanji who was close at hand, shutting his left eye.</p><p>Sizzle…</p><p>Sinful energy entwined and converged.</p><p>The power of the evil god furiously compressed.</p><p>In an instant, everyone in the Saint Hall felt their scalp tingle, and Dao Xuanji, in particular, stepped back in alarm, “Ai Cangsheng, what are you trying to do!”</p><p>“Cangsheng…” The Ninth Divine Priest barely lifted a foot.</p><p>Bang!!!</p><p>The entire Saint Hall exploded.</p><p>An arrow nailed itself before her feet.</p><p>“Ai Cangsheng, listen to this old man’s advice…” Elder Yu, terrified, took flight, but just as he looked up.</p><p>Bang!!!</p><p>As space resisted overhead, that dreadful arrow, carrying the power of the ancestral source, was hammered into mid-air without causing the collapse of space.</p><p>The arrow trembled, quivering right above Elder Yu’s forehead, sending chills down his spine.</p><p>Fast!</p><p>Too fast!</p><p>Whether it was the Ninth Divine Priest or Dao Xuanji, let alone the young people around, no one had seen clearly when Ai Cangsheng had turned and fired the arrow…</p><p>But anyone who moved, be it an arrow pinning the foot or piercing the head, none failed to hinder their movement.</p><p>Long ago, Xi thought Lord Cangsheng was an archer, supposed to be strong at range but weak in close combat.</p><p>Now, Xi felt he was wrong.</p><p>Not that he had a misunderstanding about “archers,” but he had again underestimated one of the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>What kind of a long-range shooter was this?</p><p>When it comes to close combat, Emperor Cangsheng, who could fight with The Divine, definitely couldn’t have any weakness!</p><p>Dao Xuanji panicked.</p><p>She thought Ai Cangsheng was joking.</p><p>Only now, after he had finished speaking, did she finally understand why this man had such an aloof and laconic demeanor.</p><p>What she thought, what Ai Cangsheng thought…</p><p>“`</p><p>They’re not on the same level at all!</p><p>“Ancestral God Fate Chart?”</p><p>As Dao Xuanji retreated, she gestured with her hands and said, “Actually, the Ancestral God Fate Chart, the five great aristocratic families of the Holy Emperor…”</p><p>“None,” Ai Cangsheng’s bow trembled on the string.</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s face turned deathly pale as she blurted out, “Even if you now retreat from the God Executioner’s Ruins…”</p><p>“They haven’t come out yet, those who haven’t entered can still enter,” Ai Cangsheng’s bow brimmed with blood-red urgency.</p><p>Dao Xuanji shook her head fiercely, “There must still be a chance, just like you said…”</p><p>“Yes, one chance. I’ll call for Ran Ming again, and Ran Ming won’t let me in,” declared Gong Zhenxian, with his edge fully revealed!</p><p>Dao Xuanji felt like she was about to burst, scraping her guts for more words, she sternly rebuked with inward trepidation, “Ai Cangsheng! With such a formidable enemy before us! Are you going to kill the Hallmaster first?”</p><p>“How can one dispel external troubles without first eliminating internal worries? If Dao Qiongcang doesn’t leave, how can I ascend to the position? That was your frame of mind at the time, wasn’t it?”</p><p>“How insolent! I am the present Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace, and you are merely one of the three emperors; an outsider. By law, you should obey my command! Put down the bow!”</p><p>“I, the Holy Emperor, heed the edict, not the announcement.”</p><p>“I am a descendant of the Holy Emperor Dao Clan, Ai Cangsheng, dare you harm me and see what happens?!”</p><p>As these words were spoken, Elder Yu and the Ninth Divine Priest’s expressions changed dramatically.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng’s lips curled slightly.</p><p>“Sorry.”</p><p>Boom!!!</p><p>The air of the Saint Hall trembled.</p><p>Under the shocked gazes of Xi and others, the black-red Arrow of Evil Sin Bow, in a split second, shot through space and time towards Dao Xuanji, who had retreated to the back of the great hall…</p><p>“Screetch—”</p><p>Just in time, a cry of a golden roc resounded, and Elder Yu leapt out, his back sprouting wings, hands turning into golden claws, firmly grasping that Arrow of Evil Sin Bow!</p><p>Boom boom boom boom boom…</p><p>His body smashed into Dao Xuanji, blasting through the space of the Saint Hall and towards the Back Mountain, then penetrating a black hole to emerge from the opposite side of the void.</p><p>“Run!!!”</p><p>Elder Yu, unable to stop the arrow, roared this hysterically.</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s hairpin was completely destroyed, and her face was a picture of misery as she climbed up from the void to find her chest bones shattered by the golden roc’s wings.</p><p>Run?</p><p>She looked back in confusion, gazing in the direction of the distant Saint Hall.</p><p>“Boom!!!”</p><p>The black-red thunderbolt swept away all hints of the mountain’s osmanthus fragrance.</p><p>In the midst of the lightly swirling snow, a second Arrow of Evil Sin Bow already shot toward her face, filling Dao Xuanji’s pupils entirely with her favorite dark color.</p><p>Her soul was left with nothing but tremors.</p><p>“No!!!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Nine Sacrificial Osmanthus soared into the sky.</p><p>The branches could not contain the Arrow of Evil Sin Bow, filled with the power of the evil god; it had to be blocked by the trunk.</p><p>Boom boom boom boom boom…</p><p>But it was only for a moment, that terrifyingly powerful arrow, along with the body of the Nine Sacrificial Osmanthus, shuttled through space and time, finally pinning it heavily onto the protective array of Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>“Hum!”</p><p>The great array shone brightly.</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s eyes also brightened, as she suddenly remembered something.</p><p>“Heavenly Mechanism Three…”</p><p>Before she could finish her sentence, the space in front of her chest split open, revealing the tip of a black-red arrowhead.</p><p>What an incredible mastery of force that was!</p><p>Before the arrowhead emerged, Dao Xuanji couldn’t even detect any unusual fluctuations in the space an inch before her.</p><p>“Boom!!!”</p><p>The arrow pierced through her chest and the sound followed.</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s chest completely shattered, her head flew off, her pupils filled with an unbelievable terror.</p><p>“No, no…”</p><p>She could no longer think.</p><p>She hadn’t even considered that she might not die at the hands of Xu Xiaoshou, but by Ai Cangsheng’s hand?</p><p>“Ruins!!!”</p><p>Elder Yu’s heart-wrenching voice echoed from afar.</p><p>Dao Xuanji suddenly remembered something, her head spinning in the air, her mouth wide open:</p><p>“Ran…”</p><p>As the word left her lips, the arrow sealed her throat.</p><p>“Boom!!!”</p><p>“`</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
