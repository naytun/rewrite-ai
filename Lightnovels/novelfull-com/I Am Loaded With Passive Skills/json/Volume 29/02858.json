planting grains but losing the essence of life and death.</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>At that moment, Feng Zhongzui’s horrified exclamation echoed through the five domains of the continent:</p><p>“The Emotion Sword Technique, third realm, the Secular Sword?!”</p><p>“Elder Gu, integrating the second realm of the Seven Great Sword Techniques from mundane to transcendent, forcefully brought forth the Secular Sword…”</p><p>“Does he wish to become a God and be revered as an ancestor right here and now, to ascend as the Sword God of the new era?!”</p><p>The explosive tone and terrifying content instantly set off a bomb in the minds and eyes of all the viewers in front of the Dao Imparting Mirror.</p><p>In front of the Burial Sword Tomb, Gu Qinger, others, as well as the throng of ancient swordsmen and spiritual swordsmen, were full of fear and shock.</p><p>“This?”</p><p>Compared to other places where the Path of the Ancient Swordsman was not as prominent, everyone here had a common understanding:</p><p>.com</p><p>The path of the God of Sword, Gu Louying, is to first master the other Eight Great Sword Techniques, and then use the Emotion Sword Technique Secular Sword to seal their Godhood and ancestral reverence.</p><p>Indeed, what Gu Yu cultivated was also the orthodox path of the Sword God, the same path as Senior Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>Around the battlefield, aside from Li Fuyu, probably only his path was the purest; even Mei Siren couldn’t match up.</p><p>But there’s a reason why the Sword God could become a God and ancestor!</p><p>To invoke the Secular Sword, one must open the Mystical Gate, and the well-known premise is that your other Eight Great Sword Techniques must all be complete!</p><p>So…</p><p>What is complete?</p><p>Quite simply, at least the second realm of the eight major techniques in the Emotionless Sword Technique, the Phantom Sword Technique, and the Emotion Sword Technique must reach a level of proficiency and comprehension close to that of Mei Siren’s Wisdom is Emptiness… and above, only then it would suffice!</p><p>Could Gu Yu achieve that?</p><p>No, he couldn’t!</p><p>Even the number of Power Upanishad Formations he summoned at this moment appeared exaggerated, if compared to the actual threshold for invoking the Secular Sword, he was still one short.</p><p>— The Power Upanishad Formation of the second realm of the Phantom Sword Technique from the Lord of Phantom City is something that Gu Yu couldn’t even summon!</p><p>And even if he could summon it…</p><p>Looking at the varying degrees of brightness and darkness of each Power Upanishad Formation under Mei Ziyu’s Heavenly Unravel, in comparison with Lord Shou’s and bearing in mind Zhong Yuanzi’s Great Path Diagram theory.</p><p>It was evident that even with the strongest Nine Swords Technique, Gu Yu hadn’t reached the “complete” realm, and it was even possible that he couldn’t compare to Mei Siren’s Wisdom is Emptiness.</p><p>And as for the No Sword Arts and Mo Sword Technique, he was just beginning to grasp the threshold, clearly having just understood the second realm not long ago.</p><p>This deficiency in one of the eight, coupled with the inadequate second realm of the other seven, was like a bucket with uneven planks and a missing piece in the middle.</p><p>How could it possibly invoke the Secular Sword and fish out the opportunity to be revered as a God and ancestor from the Mystical Gate?</p><p>This was seeking death!</p><p>“Elder Gu’s action…”</p><p>In the vast Feng Family City of the Southern Region, most people before the First Viewing Platform had red eyes at this moment.</p><p>They could certainly see that this was a path to certain death; was Elder Gu such a fool who could not see this at all?</p><p>No!</p><p>He had deviated.</p><p>His path had already died once.</p><p>Knowing that he might never advance again, instead of returning to a peaceful, faded life,</p><p>he’d rather sacrifice himself, letting the world witness the true “mystery” of the Secular Sword, becoming a once-in-an-era “Master of One Sword” for all to see across the five regions!</p><p>“In the vast world, where sword immortals gather, to look upon each other and yet be underestimated, how many have the courage to open the Mystical Gate of the Secular Sword?”</p><p>Bazhun’an’s eyes were full of admiration.</p><p>Having watched the fight between the youngsters for so long, perhaps there were indeed a few moves that were refreshing, but they added nothing to the Path.</p><p>Now, with the appearance of the Secular Sword, although the outcome was bound to bring sighs of regret, he felt he had seen something worthwhile.</p><p>“The Secular Sword…” Gou Wuyue watched intently, unwilling to miss any detail.</p><p>Bazhun’an glanced at him, “When will your path reach this step?”</p><p>Gou Wuyue did not respond.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao looked to his left and right, then squinted his eyes.</p><p>A few married women passing by the Di Family’s courtyard looked at her from a distance and whispered to each other.</p><p>“Do you think the Di family’s new bride is not right? Her gaze is so straight, and she looks so foolish. Could it be because a high fever turned her into an idiot?”</p><p>“Don’t you know, this new wife of Di Yelei isn’t like any ordinary person. I heard that she had something going on with Businessman Zhang from the city… Anyway, she failed to escape marriage and jumped into the river on her wedding night. She ended up like this because of the cold she caught while having a high fever.”</p><p>“If you ask me, what’s the use of keeping such a shameless daughter-in-law? Better just tie her up and sell her to the brothel to save on medical expenses.”</p><p>“Di Yelei is pretty good actually. If it weren’t for his two children, he wouldn’t have married this disaster of a woman back home…”</p><p>The chirping in her ears made Liu Sisi gently close her eyes.</p><p>She had heard similar gossip over the past few days, but she simply did not pay attention to them!</p><p>Others thought she had caught a cold from escaping marriage and falling into the water, staying sick for several days. However, only she knew that she had changed her core by now, and she was no longer the same person.</p><p>The original her was just an orphan whose parents had died, grew up with her grandpa in their rural hometown. When she got her first month’s salary after graduating from college, she bought a bottle of red wine to celebrate, but after getting drunk, she woke up as this Liu Sisi, who had attempted to escape her wedding and drowned in an accident.</p><p>The gossip from a few married women suddenly woke up her idle thoughts, and she realized that she had forgotten about the big problem waiting for her!</p><p>A hurried footsteps were heard, and soon, a big man appeared before her eyes.</p><p>Di Yelei had just come back from the old house, and with a belly full of idle anger, he felt suffocated and irritable when he thought about his sickly wife lying in bed.</p><p>His biological mother passed away as soon as he was born, and tragedy struck his betrothed wife before their marriage. Years later, he finally found a new wife. Just when their lives were starting to improve, she had a fall and died, leaving him with two children and a mountain of debt.</p><p>Initially, Aunt Zhang had persuaded him, thinking about his young children, and hearing the matchmaker talking up the bride’s beauty and abilities. He gritted his teeth and agreed to the marriage, but in the end, it turned out like this.</p><p>“The Pilgrim!”</p><p>“No, the Number One Sword Deity!”</p><p>At this moment, the world watched in awe, and even Xu Xiaoshou was moved.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
