What Goes Around Comes Around, Li Fuyu, Another Round Of Riding The Sword Backwards_3</h1><p>Chapter 2835: Chapter 1508: What Goes Around Comes Around, Li Fuyu, Another Round of Riding the Sword Backwards_3</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Fengdu Sword suddenly surged, returning to its strongest form.</p><p>Before Li Fuyu, the sword light created for defense was reluctantly pushed back, even sharply caving in toward her direction.</p><p>Change in Feng Shui!</p><p>Previously, she dominated Xu Xiaoshou in the fight, but now Xu Xiaoshou, wielding her Fengdu Sword, was overpowering her… and he did not relent!</p><p>As the defensive sword light faltered, Xu Xiaoshou stomped on the sword’s hilt, causing Hidden Bitter to “clang” as it spun and flew into his hand.</p><p>“Phantom Swords Technique: Fengdu Sword!”</p><p>With Hidden Bitter in hand, Xu Xiaoshou coldly turned around and thrust the trembling black sword into the vast white light emerging from the defensive sword strike.</p><p>The Five Domains Spectator was all shaken by the sight, but under that stomp, Li Fuyu’s Fengdu Sword violently shattered, transforming into endless energy that surged into Hidden Bitter’s sword body.</p><p>And as the small Hidden Bitter stabbed into the great expanse of the defensive white sword light, a heavy, colossal, ancient Soul Sword explored from the widely opened gates of hell belonging to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>.com</p><p>“Point of Path: Space-Time Transition.”</p><p>Swish!</p><p>The massive Soul Sword thrust forward only to disappear midway through the air.</p><p>When it reappeared, the half-tip of the sword had already passed Li Fuyu’s Unsheathing Sword and stopped before her head.</p><p>Beneath the greatsword, a person is as insignificant as an ant.</p><p>In that moment, the whole world went silent.</p><p>Feng Zhongzui felt his heartbeat miss a beat, and in the next breath, he erupted, “Using his own method against him… well played, Lord Shou!”</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Mei Siren’s Taicheng Sword tightened, the spatial turmoil at his feet vanished, and he followed into the Space-Time Transition just as Xu Xiaoshou unleashed his sword.</p><p>Before the Fengdu Sword shattered Li Fuyu’s soul body, he appeared at her side.</p><p>With a “boom,” the sword image suddenly rose from the waist, and beneath it, Yama, without hesitation, launched directly at him, each one raising both arms, converging their palms onto the sword body of Xu Xiaoshou’s Fengdu Sword.</p><p>“Stop, Xiaoshou!” It was only then did the voice from behind catch up.</p><p>“Obstruction encountered, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou parted his lips, somewhat dazed as he glanced at Master Siren who suddenly entered the scene.</p><p>Immediately, his gaze shifted to the Yamas lined up in a single file under the Fengdu Sword, each one pressing their palms against the sword.</p><p>The faces of the Yamas were incredibly ferocious, but now, each seemed somewhat awkward.</p><p>“I didn’t intend to kill her,” Xu Xiaoshou hesitated to say.</p><p>An awkward expression also appeared on Mei Siren’s face, his expression twitching as he retracted his Taicheng Sword, and after a long while, managed only one word:</p><p>“Pity…”</p><p>Li Fuyu was also stunned.</p><p>She never expected so many changes in the final instant of her sword attack.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had strengthened her Fengdu Sword…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had shattered her Fengdu Sword…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou then summoned his own Fengdu Sword…</p><p>Point of Path combined with Space-Time Transition, using just Hidden Bitter, he disregarded the defense of the protective sword light, unleashed a close-range power move, nearly shattering his own soul body…</p><p>All these were completed in the blink of an eye!</p><p>The Xu Xiaoshou who had always been suppressed by her, never demonstrated such adaptive techniques and swordsmanship at different stages, neither was his response ever this swift.</p><p>So, had he set up all this, just to seize the moment when he detected a slack on her part, to counterattack, burst forth, and finish?</p><p>Li Fuyu took a deep breath, under the vast white sword light, she reverted from her soul body back to her human form dressed in blue clothes.</p><p>She first addressed Mei Siren, who was alternatively staring at the sky and scratching his sword, nearly whistling in an I-don’t-care manner:</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>Swish.</p><p>As if ready for this moment, Mei Siren flicked out a paper fan.</p><p>This made him feel his arrival wasn’t so sudden and that he wasn’t breaking any rules.</p><p>He just didn’t want either Xu Xiaoshou or Li Fuyu to die in this battle.</p><p>Whoever died, it would be a loss for the Ancient Sword Cultivation World.</p><p>However, Li Fuyu stared at the paper fan hesitantly, murmuring, “Deserved… punishment… right?”</p><p>Huh?</p><p>Mei Siren’s hand trembled, hurriedly flipping the fan over: “You read it wrong.”</p><p>A small effort?</p><p>Reading the words on the fan, Li Fuyu smiled broadly, seeming relieved about the outcome of the battle, and then she turned to Xu Xiaoshou:</p><p>“I lost.”</p><p>“According to our agreement, I belong to you.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
