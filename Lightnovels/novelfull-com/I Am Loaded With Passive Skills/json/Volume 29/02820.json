It’s happening!”</p><p>“Such things as Jade Capital City, we ancient swordsmen aren’t concerned with; it’s just a wager.”</p><p>“Next up is the second battle of the Sword Deities, let’s forget the weirdness that just happened and return to the pure enjoyment of the fight itself!”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui, grappling with the Dao Imparting Mirror, panned it between Lord Shou and Li Fuyu, providing ample pre-battle analysis and introductions of their respective strengths and sabers.</p><p>This battle had been delayed for a while, with many interludes in between…</p><p>Unexpectedly, when there was no trouble before, Hallmaster Xuanji had frequently shown up, flaunting her power.</p><p>But now that the city had been taken, she remained utterly silent.</p><p>Feng Zhongzui was somewhat scared, always feeling that while he was broadcasting, some unforeseen event might occur and he might just abruptly be cut off.</p><p>Yet with the highest-ranking individuals reluctant to show themselves, no one could change the overall situation, and the battle of the Seven Sword Deities was able to proceed.</p><p>Since everyone had come…</p><p>Feng Zhongzui glanced at Elder Fang, the family head behind him, and felt a slight sense of security.</p><p>The people from the five regions also regained composure, shifting their focus from the upheaval of Jade Capital City back to Feng Zhongzui’s impassioned pre-battle introduction.</p><p>Until the introduction gradually faded, and as the aura in the Arena solidified bit by bit, everyone became utterly focused.</p><p>“Apologies for the wait.”</p><p>The Dao Imparting Mirror, facing Xu Xiaoshou, assessed the woman dressed in a simple green sword robe from top to bottom once again.</p><p>After a slight pause, he spoke up, “I’m actually curious, why do you keep pursuing me for a fight, even willing to be used by the Holy Divine Palace, what is your purpose?”</p><p>Li Fuyu, holding a pure white sword, slowly said:</p><p>“I want you.”</p><p>With just one sentence, the atmosphere of the Arena suddenly became extraordinarily odd.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing tilted his head.</p><p>A blind man! His eyes covered with a black cloth!</p><p>At that instant, through Feng Zhongzui’s trouble-stirring Dao Imparting Mirror, the people of the five regions felt as if they could distinctly see flames burning in the place of Lei Shuangxing’s eyes, furiously “staring” at his sister.</p><p>Lei Xi’er, on the other hand, was utterly unphased.</p><p>Yet it seemed as if there was a scream inside her that sprang up but was immediately suppressed.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was very averse to self-absorbed people like Beibei, and at this moment, couldn’t help but point a finger at himself, astonished, “You like me?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
