Is there a Boss raising a pig?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered it, considering the stature of the other people on the Ancestral God Ranking.</p><p>Whether descendants of the demi-saint family, Chief Yama, or Palace Master of the Xu Yue Grey Palace…</p><p>How did Zhou Tianshen, with neither the qualifications nor the ability, manage to get six God Fated Stars!</p><p>Even if the hot potato were passed onto his hands, Xu Xiaoshou felt he would have to be on guard against bosses from all sides, to the point of seeing shadows in every sound…</p><p>“Uh.”</p><p>At this point in his thoughts, Xu Xiaoshou had a sudden epiphany.</p><p>Either Zhou Tianshen had a major powerhouse by his side, demanding he hold onto the God Fated Stars to appear on the ranking in an unconventional sense,</p><p>Or, everyone was tacitly waiting for this pig to be fully fattened before slaughtering it.</p><p>After all, aside from Zhou Tianshen, others had clear and familiar names, and everyone knew where they stood.</p><p>If anyone’s number of God Fated Stars became excessive, they could easily become the target of a collective attack.</p><p>One on one, perhaps those on the ranking would not fear.</p><p>But one against many, even Huang Quan would have to be wary, right?</p><p>“Little chap, this is just precious…”</p><p>Once again scanning the Ancestral God Ranking, Xu Xiaoshou noticed another peculiar detail.</p><p>The number of God Fated Stars held by the seven people on the ranking, when summed, was already more than eighteen—it was twenty-one.</p><p>“So, there are extras.”</p><p>“Even now, there are God Fated Stars scattered about unclaimed, with the number being unlimited, and whoever accumulates eighteen first will take the grand prize?”</p><p>In that case, Zhou Tianshen, that big fat pig, truly shouldn’t be slaughtered prematurely.</p><p>“If I were Yue Gongli, I’d collect twelve God Fated Stars, then hunt down Zhou Tianshen and fly to victory on the spot!”</p><p>“Of course, others aren’t fools, by the time I’m nearing twelve, there must already be someone lying in wait near Zhou Tianshen wanting to ambush me…”</p><p>“But I’m not stupid either, just keep another pig by my side, distribute the God Fated Stars in advance, slaughter Zhou Tianshen then the smaller pig…”</p><p>“But they can also watch the Ancestral God Ranking, any unfamiliar name that appears out of place could give away my plan…”</p><p>“I can only counter back…”</p><p>The Divine Relics, is it actually a game of strategy?</p><p>In the end, everyone might reap rewards, everyone might attain Godhood and seal their ancestors, and only Zhou Tianshen is destined to be eliminated?</p><p>—Such a miserable Zhou Tianshen!</p><p>Before even catching up with old friends from the Spirit Palace period, Xu Xiaoshou was already unable to contain his laughter.</p><p>He could almost see in advance this poor fellow being chased from north to south, seemingly indestructible, mistakenly believing he had become stronger, and his comically futile attempts.</p><p>“You’re absolutely going to survive until the mid-late stage, huh!”</p><p>While mumbling to himself, Xu Xiaoshou reined in his smile, and his gaze finally landed on the sixth place of the Ancestral God Rankings: “Six, Nian, one”.</p><p>“Nian…”</p><p>He was familiar with the other names.</p><p>It was this one that seemed excessively strange.</p><p>But to say he had never heard of it was not exactly true.</p><p>On the jade scroll of information given by Aunt Xiang in Yougui Pavilion, Xu Xiaoshou had seen this name:</p><p>“The new Dark Division Chief, Nian.”</p><p>“`</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
