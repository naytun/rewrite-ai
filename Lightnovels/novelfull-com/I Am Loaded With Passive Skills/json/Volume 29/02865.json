Whoever loves the broken mask can wear it; I sure as hell won’t!”</p><p>“Yay! Long live happiness! Senior Wei Feng, you’ve never let loose in your life, have you? In fact, you don’t even know that the real you is the one at the entrance to the Ran Ming ruins. Why not try on a mask for fun?”</p><p>“Get lost, I’d rather die than wear your damn mask!”</p><p>“Oh~ Old Gou…”</p><p>“Sorry, make way, please.”</p><p>“Yay~ Little brat…”</p><p>“Have you offended someone?” Bazhun’an pressed his four fingers against the spinning head in front of him.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang paused for a moment, his head emerging from the headgear before spinning elegantly to his feet, spreading his arms wide and smiling welcomingly, “No way~ why would you say that~”</p><p>With a smack, Bazhun’an tossed the flimsy headgear onto his face, “Nothing, it’s just that a phrase suddenly came to mind.”</p><p>Updated by NovG○.co</p><p>“Which phrase?”</p><p>“One does not slap a smiling face.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s smile remained unaltered as he let out a chuckle before readjusting the headgear, “That’s funny, little brat. How could you have such a naive thought?”</p><p>“I hope it is just my naivety.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang thus selectively ignored this dull fellow and spun around a few more times to arrive in front of Wei Feng, gesturing to his mask, “Want one? They’re really fun~”</p><p>Wei Feng, expressionless, pointed to the sky.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“Only if the sky falls.”</p><p>…</p><p>The atmosphere in the Saint Hall grew so tense it was as if the sky itself was about to collapse.</p><p>Beibei, Xi, and others kept their eyes on their noses and hearts, daring not to make a sound, afraid that even the slightest noise would draw Lord Cangsheng’s attention.</p><p>“Perhaps…” Seeing that no one else spoke up, Dao Xuanji had no choice but to stand and carefully choose her words:</p><p>“You don’t know, a lot has happened at the Holy Divine Palace in the time you’ve been away.”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng, of course, knew many things had happened.</p><p>The Saint Hall had changed, and even the vibe of the people here was different – from a glimpse within you could infer the whole.</p><p>If there truly was nothing wrong, then that certain someone wouldn’t have had Wei An guard him, breaking into the Arena time after time, forcing himself to give up the chance for the Ancestral God Fate Chart.</p><p>Nor would it have been possible for him to end his battle with The Divine early and return from the ruins by his own hand.</p><p>Therefore, something momentous must have befallen the sacred mountain.</p><p>And these things, Ai Cangsheng couldn’t be bothered to communicate with others only to receive a heap of lies before having to confirm them with Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>He only wanted to see that person first.</p><p>He trusts no one, only Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>“If the sky has fallen, then have Dao Qiongcang come see me first.”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng spoke again, not hiding his disdain for everyone present in the slightest.</p><p>Elder Yu’s eyes narrowed into slits, not daring to let out a laugh. His dead-fish eyes rolled within those slits, glancing towards the main seat.</p><p>Dao Xuanji took a deep breath and said plainly, “Dao Qiongcang has fled the sacred mountain!”</p><p>The great hall fell dead silent.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng’s mind wandered for three breaths before he finally grasped the meaning behind those words.</p><p>His lips twitched as if he was about to speak.</p><p>Just as Dao Xuanji anticipated his reaction would be off, afraid he didn’t understand, she added:</p><p>“I’m not joking, Dao Qiongcang colluded with the Saint Servant, joined forces with ghost beasts, and after slaying the Heavenly Ladder judges, he fled in fear of his crimes. He is now wanted by the Holy Divine Palace, subject to death on sight!”</p><p>The great hall fell into silence once more.</p><p>Ao Sheng, Fangfang, and others trembled with fear, not knowing what reaction Lord Cangsheng would have upon learning all this.</p><p>This time, Ai Cangsheng’s smile froze on his face for more than ten breaths before his mind returned.</p><p>This man who usually sat unsmiling in his wheelchair just lifted the corners of his lips again, still smiling.</p><p>Uh?</p><p>Everyone sensed something was amiss.</p><p>How could he possibly still manage to smile?</p><p>Lord Cangsheng was personally invited to guard the sacred mountain by Hallmaster Dao back in the day; they were said to be as close as brothers. How could he still smile upon hearing such news?</p><p>Dao Xuanji also found it absurd.</p><p>At this moment, Ai Cangsheng’s smile was more distressing than tears.</p><p>But Ai Cangsheng was indeed smiling, then he turned cold, sweeping his gaze across everyone in the great hall without mercy, meticulously observing cufflinks, collars, the insides of garments…</p><p>He then turned to the carvings on the pillars, the cracks on the walls, and the pearls on the ceiling…</p><p>Lastly, he even spared a glance at the rotting flesh beside him…</p><p>As though he was searching, identifying something?</p><p>“Stop the nonsense.”</p><p>After a pause, Ai Cangsheng spoke indifferently to the empty air, “I don’t have time to play with you, come out.”</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>Xi felt a chill across his forehead in an instant.</p><p>He felt like he understood, but he would have been better off not understanding like Fangfang — did Lord Cangsheng think that Hallmaster Dao was still on the sacred mountain and playing a joke on him?</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s eyebrows shot up, she appeared torn between tears and laughter, but eventually, her expression settled into calmness as she repeated:</p><p>“I am not joking.”</p><p>Touched on a sensitive nerve, Ai Cangsheng took another meticulous look at this person claiming to be “I,” from her faint brows, to her towering chest, to the horsetail whisk, to the black boots…</p><p>There was no slip-up!</p><p>And this, my friend, is exactly where your slip-up lies!</p><p>Ai Cangsheng sneered, “Always cross-dressing, is it fun for you?”</p><p>Uh? Xi’s eyes widened in shock.</p><p>What does that mean? Wait, there seems to be a lot of information in that response?</p><p>But it was exactly those two instinctive reactions that made Xi regret it, as Lord Cangsheng’s cold gaze suddenly slanted towards him.</p><p>“Uh…” he turned into a stunned goose, his words lodged in his throat, completely unable to emerge.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng did not speak either, just staring him down directly, as if to see right through him, to break him, to stare him to death!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
