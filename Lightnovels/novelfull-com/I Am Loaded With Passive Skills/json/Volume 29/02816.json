What kind of Yuan Mansion could contain Jade Capital City? You’re wildly fantasizing!”</p><p>“Then it must be Sky City, that so-called Sub-Face Gate, isn’t it said to be in the hands of the Saint Servant? Maybe Lord Shou has moved the city to an island…”</p><p>“Are you all deaf? Lord Shou said, ‘Today, enter my Apricot Realm’, he moved it into the ‘Apricot Realm’!”</p><p>“Then tell us, what is the Apricot Realm?”</p><p>“Uh, the Apricot Realm is… Look, could it be related to the Ancestral Dragon Apricot?”</p><p>Everyone started a fault-finding game, trying to spot a flaw in the blank space shown in the Dao Imparting Mirror.</p><p>Eventually, they speculated that the most logical assumption appeared to be that Lord Shou combined the Ancestral Dragon Apricot, transporting Jade Capital City into his world?</p><p>What Yuan Mansion?</p><p>That’s all in the past!</p><p>Using the Ancestral Dragon Apricot as the World Tree, indeed, it could create a world capable of accommodating Jade Capital City.</p><p>And that Dragon Apricot, it is said, started waving the flag behind Lord Shou as soon as he began his slaughter upon ascending to Jade Capital City.</p><p>Which means…</p><p>Had Lord Shou already set his sights on this heavyweight spiritual cultivation center of the Five Domains back then?</p><p>“Previously, when he caused explosions, we felt he was harming Heaven and Earth.”</p><p>“Now, he doesn’t even do explosions anymore, dare to provoke me, and he’ll take away both the people and the city?”</p><p>Buzz…</p><p>The golden patterns of the Ancestral Dragon Apricot in the horizon, accompanying the disappearance of Jade Capital City, seemed to validate most people’s guesses.</p><p>Apricot Realm.</p><p>Jade Capital City.</p><p>When there was a thunderous tremor beneath people’s feet, the tens of millions of inhabitants of the city fell into a stupor.</p><p>“Ownership of the cage has changed, now enter my Apricot Realm?”</p><p>Heads of large sects, families, and organizational forces quickly organized their personnel to confirm whether their spiritual arrays were still connected to Jade Capital City?</p><p>No.</p><p>Had their spiritual arrays suffered any damage?</p><p>No.</p><p>Were there any casualties?</p><p>No.</p><p>Could they communicate with their secret agents, subsidiary sects, or family branches located in various parts of the Five Domains outside Jade Capital City?</p><p>…No.</p><p>“What! No contact can be made?”</p><p>When it was found that everything inside Jade Capital City was as good as ever, but all links to the outside world were completely severed, as if they had indeed entered an entirely new world, all sects and families were thrown into panic.</p><p>This was truly “Jade Capital as a birdcage”!</p><p>The rules and order within the cage remained perfectly intact.</p><p>The people outside the cage moved the cage from one home to another new home…</p><p>To move an entire city, what immense power?</p><p>Could this really be something a Spiritual Cultivator who has just reached the Cutting Path stage could do?</p><p>Spatial Upanishad, to this extent?</p><p>Some worried, others were happy; at least for the forces in the city like the Xiang family, Ghost God gang, and old minions of tea houses, they suddenly relaxed their minds.</p><p>The feeling among all houses was that it had ended…</p><p>All stories of competing in wits and courage under Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe and at the foot of the Holy Divine Palace had come to an end.</p><p>They were about to start a whole new life in a strange but environmentally and Heaven and Earth spiritually rich new world.</p><p>Even to say, compared to the “aged” Shengshen Continent, it had a clearer, incipient breath of Path Principles more appropriate for cultivation?</p><p>It was like an ignorant egg, waiting for someone to incubate.</p><p>What it would eventually grow into depended on the one who laid the egg and those who would incubate it.</p><p>The blizzard was subsiding.</p><p>It seemed to comfort the newcomers that with the arrival of a new world, instead of resisting, they might as well enjoy it.</p><p>“Ah—”</p><p>On a carriage at the Southern Zone gate, Li Fugui suddenly let out a loud scream.</p><p>The people on the road were still watching the fight earlier, but now each immersed in the shock of the “moving,” heard the scream and thought someone had gone mad.</p><p>Li Fugui was indeed going crazy.</p><p>But not from fright, from joy.</p><p>“Jade Capital as a birdcage, Fugui as a golden canary… Fugui?”</p><p>“Well-versed in thousands of methods of swordsmanship, incapable of poetry but able to chant, in the first poem chanted by Lord Shou, my name, Li Fugui, is present, it demonstrates his consideration of me!”</p><p>Li Fugui was ecstatic.</p><p>How could Zhu Yike fight with him now?</p><p>Jade Capital as a birdcage, a golden canary? Hahahaha, that’s nonsense!</p><p>Sitting on the front seat of the carriage, he recklessly surveyed Jade Capital City with his spiritual senses, even daring to peer beyond Jade to see a strange, desolate, war-torn world.</p><p>The Aura was very familiar, it was the Apricot Realm!</p><p>Li Fugui could no longer contain himself, he jumped off the carriage and stood atop the new world, raising his arms and yelling:</p><p>“Lord! Shou! Mighty! Invincible!”</p><p>The majority who had just moved were unable to accept the new environment, and seeing such a direct declaration of subservience…</p><p>“You coward, you’ve started flattering so soon?”</p><p>“Get down here, man, don’t forget we are all from the Holy Divine Palace; we are under the protection of the Holy Divine Guards!”</p><p>“Holy Divine Guards, come quickly, there’s a rebel here, capture him… uh, Holy Divine Guards, why are you sitting on the ground, stand up, don’t be discouraged!”</p><p>“Red Coat, you’re part of the Red-robed Guards, right? Wake up, don’t pretend to sleep!”</p><p>“What about the White-robed Guards? Eradicating the dark factions is your duty, right… don’t run away! I just saw you taking off your robe, you are a White-robed Guard, go exterminate Xu Xiaoshou!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
