Has Elder Gu suddenly deviated from cultivation and been ejected from the Heavenly Unravel State?” Feng Zhongzui incredulously exclaimed, “What did Lord Shou do?”</p><p>No one knew what had happened in Lord Shou’s Second World just now, and no one dared to guess what could have happened in that instant of the Second World that caused Elder Gu, who had such a steadfast heart in seeking the Path, to self-destruct.</p><p>Indeed, it was self-destruction!</p><p>It seemed that Lord Shou’s Great Silver God’s Wrath didn’t have much effect; Elder Gu’s Three Realms Unity’s Unity Extreme Sword had shattered.</p><p>That failure could only be due to one reason…</p><p>There had been a severe problem with Elder Gu himself!</p><p>Lord Shou had found this problem and mercilessly rubbed salt into the wound — he was best at doing such things!</p><p>Feng Zhongzui quickly aimed the Dao Imparting Mirror at Elder Gu, hoping to see if he could recover from the deviated state and continue fighting.</p><p>After all, only two swords had passed since the three he mentioned to Lord Shou…</p><p>But the enlarged view through the Dao Imparting Mirror only conveyed the confused, stuttering mutterings:</p><p>“True Will, there’s True Will…”</p><p>“This contains True Will… words fail me upon trying to explain…”</p><p>That disheveled hair, that aged and tremulous appearance, those eyes filled with self-doubt, bore no resemblance to the vigorous “Number One Sword Deity” before the battle!</p><p>The viewers of the Dao Imparting Mirror felt a chill run down their spines, and as their thoughts turned, they saw another figure enlarged in the screen, following Feng Zhongzui’s thoughts — Lord Shou!</p><p>Lord Shou looked on with a complex gaze, beholding the old man before him with an expression tinged with a trace of compassion, sighing solemnly.</p><p>All thoughts went wild again.</p><p>“Indeed, it’s his doing, losing is the best possible outcome when fighting against Lord Shou.”</p><p>“It’s the kind of old man who’s easily brought to collapse, driven insane; Lord Shou specializes in manipulating people’s mentality!”</p><p>“So what happened, Elder Gu seemed to have the upper hand just a moment ago…”</p><p>As for Elder Gu’s outcome, Xu Xiaoshou had a bit of foresight.</p><p>To start with, Gu Yu was never a person fond of contention; his Path lay in the mountains and streams, in pastoral life, not on the battlefield.</p><p>Yet, to advance further, he had abandoned his past secluded life and approached the Saint Hall in search of a demi-saint position.</p><p>But where could the real Path be hidden within a demi-saint person’s place?</p><p>Even if he obtained the demi-saint position, having strayed from his original intentions, could his Path possibly lead to sanctification?</p><p>One might say that from the moment Gu Yu decided to ascend the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, his path had been incorrect.</p><p>But not setting out, deeply cultivating amidst pastoral life, he would never see even a ray of hope; he had no choice but to set forth.</p><p>——That’s too contradictory!</p><p>A person standing upon such a contradictory moment inherently had an extremely fragile Dao heart.</p><p>Naturally, Xu Xiaoshou’s stroke of Second World, which hadn’t even begun to exert its power, became the last straw that broke the camel’s back.</p><p>And the poem he recited to fan the flames was, in fact, another choice for Gu Yu at the crossroads:</p><p>Either give up the search for True Will, return to the original path, continue the cultivation, and perhaps achieve a breakthrough someday.</p><p>Or seize the True Will that I have given you, which you have now also comprehended, break through the confusion, and become a Saint on the spot.</p><p>Was it just a demi-saint position? Xu Xiaoshou could indeed afford that!</p><p>However, judging by Gu Yu’s outcome, he chose neither; he became lost once again.</p><p>Predictable!</p><p>Not everyone is like Kui Leihan or Bazhun’an, with such clarity and steadfastness in their heart towards the Path.</p><p>If Gu Yu had truly grasped the mood of another world’s pottery saint at that moment, it’s probable he wouldn’t have been entangled before and ended up so contradictory.</p><p>Talent determines one’s ceiling.</p><p>Personality determines success or failure.</p><p>It can only be said that it was fate.</p><p>And this, perhaps, is the life story of most people…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou withdrew his gaze from the ancient swordsmen around him who likewise showed sympathy, casting it upon the face of Elder Gu, desperately lost in the throes of cultivation deviation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
