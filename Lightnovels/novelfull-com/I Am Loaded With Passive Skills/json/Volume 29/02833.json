She was shocked to the point of spewing Soul Blood.</p><p>At that moment, Xu Xiaoshou was struck by a moment of inspiration, recalling the scene where The Divine taught the Hungry Ghost Path directly through his body:</p><p>“Hungry Ghost Path, feasting on myriad spirits, swallowing all practices…”</p><p>“All methods are emptiness; upon digesting the three thousand, substance is converted, leaving only reverse… Below the gates of hell, reality and void invert; by passing through Yin and Yang, one can reverse spirit and flesh…”</p><p>Could the “Mountains and Seas Converge” executed with the Phantom Swords Technique as its application and based on sword cognition, referencing Divine Secret and the Way of Spiritual Cultivation, be the ultimate?</p><p>No!</p><p>At this time, the Spiritual Sword Technique Mountain and Sea simply matched Li Fuyu’s Fengdu Sword evenly.</p><p>The reason she was injured was because she was delicate and had previously suffered backlash wounds from Heavenly Abandon.</p><p>If enhanced with the power of the Hungry Ghost Path, swallowing the myriad methods of the world and transferring all her physical strength to her spiritual power, could this Spiritual Sword Technique Mountain and Sea turn from a defensive sword technique into an offensive one?</p><p>Acting upon the thought!</p><p>“Nine Swords Formation, open the gate of hell.”</p><p>Swish! Nine miniature swords of the space whirled around Xu Xiaoshou’s body and swiftly conjured a sword formation, abruptly summoning another gate of hell.</p><p>Compared to Li Fuyu’s, this gate looked somewhat illusory.</p><p>But…</p><p>If it works, it works!</p><p>As the gates of hell flung wide open, Xu Xiaoshou’s body erupted with countless “Spider Legs” that pierced into the gate. The wailing spirit souls within had not even emerged before being completely swallowed.</p><p>“Burp.”</p><p>The abundance of power welling up from the various methods and spirits almost breached its containment, causing Xu Xiaoshou to involuntarily let out a satisfied burp.</p><p>This strange sound, falling across the battlefield, was truly grating!</p><p>“Not good…”</p><p>Li Fuyu’s soul body had a bad premonition. With a gesture, she promptly sacrificed the soul blood spewed from her mouth, transforming it into a dark light that shot into the Fengdu Sword.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>The body of the Fengdu Sword lit up with a bloody glow.</p><p>The massive and ancient Soul Sword, though seemingly still in the void, had lost its momentum, but now, as if reinvigorated, launched a second assault, aiming at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Bring it on!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou called out loudly.</p><p>Then, to the astonishment of Li Fuyu and all the spectators, he drew in his limbs, and the myriad Spider Legs on his body simultaneously retracted within him.</p><p>So bizarre…</p><p>Not just the sword technique was strange.</p><p>The way he withdrew the sword bore no trace of an ancient swordsman’s grace, completely out of line with “elegance.”</p><p>But its effect was undeniably clear…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Spider Legs of sword cognition retracted, and Spiritual Sword Technique Mountain and Sea vanished along with them.</p><p>The unobstructed Fengdu Sword broke through layer after layer of cyan light in the void, on the verge of shattering Xu Xiaoshou’s soul body.</p><p>—A negative effect?</p><p>“Has Lord Shou gone mad?” Feng Zhongzui couldn’t make sense of it, “Defending was working fine, why choose suicide?”</p><p>But just like his and the Five Domains Spectators’ feelings, nobody was Lord Shou; hence, nobody could understand Lord Shou.</p><p>As the Fengdu Sword pierced toward him, suddenly, Spider Legs surged out from Xu Xiaoshou’s body again. This time, they did not target the Way of the Heavens or penetrate space, but instead, all swords fiercely impaled the giant Soul Sword.</p><p>“Reversed Sword Style!”</p><p>With a roar on the verge of tearing apart the heavens.</p><p>The slicing approach of the Fengdu Sword, forcefully twisted by the sudden burst of soul power from Xu Xiaoshou, bent out of shape.</p><p>Then, it grazed past his shoulder, aiming towards the onlooking spectators.</p><p>“Damn!”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui jerked in shock, the Dao Imparting Mirror trembling in his grip.</p><p>Unfortunately, the sword was carving towards the space right above his head, and as Mei Siren, the great shield, sensed the danger, he made his escape first.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
