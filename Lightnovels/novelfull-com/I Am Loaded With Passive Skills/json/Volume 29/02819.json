Were you frightened by Elder Dao the Flamboyant?”</p><p>Dragon Apricot fell silent for a moment, not knowing whether to resist the nickname “Dragon Apricot” or to rebut Xu Xiaoshou’s mockery.</p><p>In comparison to this life-preserving tree, which appeared timid, Xu Xiaoshou was far too calm and clear-headed.</p><p>He certainly had reservations about Dao Qiongcang, but was not paranoid.</p><p>He knew clearly…</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s strength wasn’t in the moment he landed on the Apricot Realm — that was just the outcome.</p><p>He was strong because he started planning from the Four Symbols Secret Realm, using Bei Huai and Holy Emperor Qilin to exhaust his own essence, counting even his second true body trapped in the Ran Ming ruins, and finally doing everything possible to drive himself into a dead end like the Apricot Realm — his strength was in this process.</p><p>Even so, Xu Xiaoshou could still escape, jumping out of the dead-end, albeit with some elements of gamble in it.</p><p>Just as he wasn’t sure he could completely evade Dao Qiongcang’s capture plan, was Elder Dao the Flamboyant absolutely certain he could capture him?</p><p>Certainly not.</p><p>He also failed.</p><p>From the Four Symbols Secret Realm to Changde Town to Qingyuan Mountain, this long-drawn, exhaustive strategy, akin to devising the half-saint position of Holy Divine Palace with the Ten High Nobles from Abyss Island took as much preparation— the alignment of time, place, and people were indispensable.</p><p>The only difference might be that the Water Ghost didn’t betray Eighth whereas Dao Qiongcang was betrayed by his own people.</p><p>If it were to happen again, could Dao Qiongcang replicate or even perfect this strategy?</p><p>No… I don’t know.</p><p>Alright, even if he could!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wouldn’t fall for it again and try to save Aunt Xiang, who he now knew couldn’t be saved at all.</p><p>Everyone has grown up…</p><p>If it were to happen again, Xu Xiaoshou would only escape from the situation earlier — he wouldn’t choose to desperately fight against Bei Huai.</p><p>He would have to flee to the Southern Region to seek Bazhun’an, leaving Holy Emperor Qilin and the Ten High Nobles for Bazhun’an to deal with.</p><p>In doing so, there would be no subsequent series of events.</p><p>Therefore, even if relocating Jade Capital City into the Apricot Realm marked many of Dao Qiongcang’s anchor points, Xu Xiaoshou was not afraid of that guy showing up.</p><p>First, Elder Dao the Flamboyant had now become a traitor of the Holy Divine Palace, having an even worse status than a Saint Servant, and it was unlikely he would help backstab his sister.</p><p>Second, so what if he comes? With Xu Xiaoshou in his prime, possessing his second true body for protection and the capability of Spatial Upanishad to escape, what is there to fear?</p><p>Clearly, Dragon Apricot hadn’t thought this through and didn’t know that Xu Xiaoshou had already considered all the back roads while relocating the city, prompting it to speak again:</p><p>“What if once again, at the time of your exhaustion, his ‘Branding’ appears in the Apricot Realm?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head with a smile, “There won’t be a next time.”</p><p>He rarely set himself up with declarations, for fear of being proven wrong.</p><p>But this time, he reminded himself in the manner of making a declaration, that no matter what, he couldn’t fall into a state of “ultimate weakness” again.</p><p>The feeling of leaving his fate in someone else’s hands, tasting it once, was enough.</p><p>Dragon Apricot still wasn’t convinced, always feeling that relocating Jade Capital City was a hot potato, easy to cause self-harm:</p><p>“Then what about Dao Xuanji, who is Dao Qioncang’s sister, coming to the Apricot Realm with the ‘Great God Descending Technique’?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was taken aback, almost laughed out loud:</p><p>“Don’t worry, I won’t kill her.”</p><p>Dragon Apricot was shocked by the response, unsure how to proceed, feeling like they were not on the same wavelength:</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou continued:</p><p>“To be honest, I already regret killing Adorable Rao.”</p><p>“Back then I was too young, not knowing that killing Rao and Yue—while satisfying one’s desire for revenge—overlooked the importance of nurturing a potential future threat.”</p><p>“There are many ways to torment someone. Now unless Dao Xuanji’s remaining two bodies stretch their necks under my sword or my junior sister’s, I won’t completely eradicate her before I am fully powerful.”</p><p>“Why?” Dragon Apricot still hadn’t figured it out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
