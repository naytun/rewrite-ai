I want to know if you truly possess mysteries or strengths unknown to me?”</p><p>Everyone present was stunned for a moment, then thought it over carefully.</p><p>Indeed, Hallmaster Dao’s resignation had been halted by Ai Cangsheng last time, but the only person he had ever recommended was Zhong Yuanzi!</p><p>Swish, all eyes suddenly turned to Zhong Yuanzi, their hearts filled with doubts.</p><p>Could he…</p><p>Could he really?</p><p>And to think, Elder Zhong really did hide something.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou hadn’t attacked the Southern Zone gate of Jade Capital City, who would have known that Elder Zhong had developed the Great Path Diagram?</p><p>But the “Great Path Diagram” couldn’t lead the Holy Divine Palace momentarily, let alone guide the people to resist the onslaught of the dark tide led by Saint Servant and Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>So…</p><p>Only Hallmaster Dao knew whether there were certain qualifications in Zhong Yuanzi, more suitable for the Hallmaster than Dao Xuanji.</p><p>Previously, everyone merely suspected…</p><p>Now, faced with many doubtful but hopeful gazes, Zhong Yuanzi himself was also momentarily stunned.</p><p>Ah?</p><p>Am I mysterious?</p><p>Am I powerful?</p><p>Little Dao knew I could, but I myself didn’t know if I could?</p><p>“Subjectively speaking…”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi hesitated to speak, “I believe I am not capable of taking on the role of Hallmaster…”</p><p>“And objectively?” Elder Yu couldn’t wait, feeling that this old fellow was hiding some heavy artillery from him.</p><p>“Objectively speaking…”</p><p>Elder Zhong grabbed another handful of his explosive hair in despair, “I really can’t do it!”</p><p>He just wasn’t cut out to be a Hallmaster!</p><p>He, along with everyone from Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, blowing up the mountain and digging their own graves before Xu Xiaoshou’s return, that would have been easier.</p><p>To win as a Hallmaster?</p><p>Absurd!</p><p>And upon further thought, he still held the Apricot Realm jade talisman given by Xu Xiaoshou—am I even the type who’d think of colluding with the enemy, and you want me as Hallmaster?</p><p>“Are you mad?”</p><p>Elder Zhong did have some affection for Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe and didn’t want to destroy it himself. “Ai Cangsheng, could it be possible that Little Dao had already plotted this all back then by laying out the misleading clues?”</p><p>This statement successfully silenced everyone.</p><p>Had he already calculated the possibility of failure during the pledge at the sacred mountain and layouting against Saint Servant, setting off a smokescreen in advance?</p><p>If it were Dao Xuanji, everyone now knew she definitely lacked that ability.</p><p>If it were Hallmaster Dao…</p><p>“It’s not impossible, huh?” Elder Yu took another look at Elder Zhong’s stupid and foolish explosive hairdo, feeling more convinced by this speculation.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng also hesitated.</p><p>He really could not be sure anymore.</p><p>After all, that person was Hallmaster Dao; everything inconceivable linked to him had a potential element of intentionality.</p><p>If Elder Zhong were strong, and planning for the greater good, Ai Cangsheng would definitely wish for him to assume the Hallmaster to strategically position against Xu Xiaoshou’s return.</p><p>If that was Hallmaster Dao’s scheme, hiss…</p><p>“If you ask me, Ai Cangsheng should be Hallmaster, and then he wouldn’t need to worry about anything else, which is better than having a leaderless and disjointed group,” Elder Yu made a decisive comment, “after all, Little Dao isn’t likely to return!”</p><p>“Shouldn’t we at least search?” Xi knew he shouldn’t speak up, but he couldn’t help but interject at this moment.</p><p>He was the one who most hoped for Hallmaster Dao’s return!</p><p>Not to mention anything else, that purple vest at the Southern Zone gate of Jade Capital City, Xi vividly remembered it to this day—before this, he could never have imagined that someone could detect the Aura of the Ancestor’s Power from a three-finger-thick vest, using it to set up a trap to capture Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Even now, thinking back, it remains absurd…</p><p>But!</p><p>The fact is!</p><p>That was the closest they came to success—Xu Xiaoshou nearly fell into the trap, unfortunately, Dao Xuanji intervened.</p><p>From the little seen…</p><p>Hallmaster Dao had to be described as unorthodox and omnipotent.</p><p>Xi had not thought much of it before, but after following Hallmaster Xuanji for a while, day by day, he missed Hallmaster Dao even more!</p><p>His words obviously struck a chord with all the young people present, and even Beibei couldn’t help but nod vigorously.</p><p>All the saints around then turned to look at Xi together, their eyes focused.</p><p>Xi felt a tremendous pressure, wishing he hadn’t spoken.</p><p>But at that moment, the gaze of the elders was filled with sympathy and helplessness, without any hint of fault-finding.</p><p>The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body said softly, “Little friend Xi, you should know that it wasn’t that Hallmaster Dao wanted to be the Hallmaster, but that we… we used the position of Hallmaster to restrain him for over thirty years; he actually only wanted to research the Divine Puppet.”</p><p>The Ancestral Tree Nine Sacrifices Gui had seen more ups and downs on this sacred mountain than all the salt and rice the young ones present had ever consumed.</p><p>She had another thing she didn’t say: Hallmaster Dao was nearly another Bei Huai.</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi couldn’t help but interject, “He’s crazier than I am, okay? Even he was stopped, yet he managed to create a Number Two; luckily, there’s only one…”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng, also unaware of the Path Division’s situation, looking at the young ones before him, whispered back, “What do you think the first thing I wanted to do upon my return was? But the one who cannot be found has returned to the vast sea, without a trace.”</p><p>Elder Yu also laughed, “If you can bring back Little Dao, I think you’d be more appropriate as Hallmaster; Hallmaster Dao could even be your deputy.”</p><p>Xi was stunned upon hearing this.</p><p>Accustomed to Hallmaster Xuanji’s pace, that a single word from him would get feedback from all demi-saints, his first reaction was…</p><p>So gentle!</p><p>Could demi-saints really be so gentle, not interrupting, answering questions directly, purely responsive, and without Veiled Insinuations!</p><p>If only they were as blatantly condescending as the Dao siblings in their daily interactions, mocking how stupid his question was, Xi wouldn’t have been so moved.</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
