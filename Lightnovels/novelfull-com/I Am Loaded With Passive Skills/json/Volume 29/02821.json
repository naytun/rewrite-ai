What for?” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyeballs spun as a plan formed in his mind.</p><p>Li Fuyu said nothing further, but lightly lifted the sword in her hand, signaling not to waste words and that all would be clear after the fight.</p><p>“No, no, no…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou changed his approach, pointing to the empty basin beneath his feet, “I fought with Beibei over a bet involving a city, what’s your wager for fighting with me?”</p><p>Li Fuyu shook her head, “No bet.”</p><p>Wow, you really are a model student, aren’t you!</p><p>But it wasn’t about whether to bet or not—it was a question of fairness!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused. “So you mean, I lose I go with you back to the sword tower, but if I win, I get nothing?”</p><p>Li Fuyu parted her lips, appearing to realize for the first time the unfairness, and then immediately closed her mouth.</p><p>“Ah?” Xu Xiaoshou was momentarily stunned.</p><p>So, what now?</p><p>You’re going to stay silent?</p><p>What a marvelous way to solve a problem!</p><p>The scene suddenly entered an impasse…</p><p>Speaking of stubbornness, Xu Xiaoshou actually was the biggest mule. If you won’t talk, then I won’t talk either; let’s see who feels awkward.</p><p>Thus, after more than ten breaths, Li Fuyu for the first time in her life experienced what ‘discomfort’ felt like.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze was fixed on her.</p><p>The surrounding ancient swordsmen and demi-saints were staring at her as well.</p><p>And probably the entire audience in front of the Dao Imparting Mirror were watching her too.</p><p>She finally realized that this was not an issue she could dodge by keeping silent, and her mature face flushed slightly, struggling to say, “I don’t have… um, a wager.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze swished downward, glancing at the sword in her hand, “You do!”</p><p>One of the twelve swords of the sword tower, Hu.</p><p>Feng Zhongzui had just introduced it, and Xu Xiaoshou was extremely keen on it.</p><p>He didn’t know when, but he’d awakened a ‘stamp collecting’ obsession, wanting to gather all the famed swords—though only in thought, as he couldn’t be bothered to actually pursue them unless it was convenient.</p><p>Li Fuyu’s expression returned to being cold as ice, she firmly shook her head, “This isn’t possible.”</p><p>“This isn’t possible, that isn’t possible, you want this, you want that too, Miss Li, you’re just like Elder Zhong, insatiably greedy,” Xu Xiaoshou indicated the explosion-like hair in the distance.</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi turned his head down in shame.</p><p>Li Fuyu turned her head to ponder for a while, then said, “If you win, the sword tower will lend itself to you for a day of free activity, which will be greatly beneficial.”</p><p>Upon hearing this declaration, all the ancient swordsmen’s minds stirred once more.</p><p>Li Fuyu undoubtedly had a way to return to the sword tower, could take people with her, and knew most if not all of its secrets!</p><p>Otherwise, she wouldn’t have said such things—right from the start, she had spoken from the perspective akin to that of the tower owner.</p><p>Indeed…</p><p>They always say ‘Sword Human of the sword tower.’</p><p>But what specifically are their duties? Beyond the speculations of outsiders, what are they actually?</p><p>This train of thought passed through the minds of many interested parties, then was quickly forgotten.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also forgot about it.</p><p>But he couldn’t forget about what was gained or lost, and after hearing her offer, laughed out loud, “If you win, I go to the sword tower, if you lose, I still go to the sword tower; so in the end, it’s good for you, not for me, right?”</p><p>“No, you’ll be free to move around,” Li Fuyu stated earnestly, “for one day.”</p><p>“Oh, so it’s the difference between you catching me to confine, and letting me move freely for one day before confining me?”</p><p>“It’s not about confining…</p><p>“Then what is it?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Li Fuyu pursed her lips, looked down at her chest, and said no more.</p><p>She couldn’t outtalk Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>The crowd was dumbstruck for a moment, then they realized, maybe the best way to deal with Xu Xiaoshou was to play the mute?</p><p>At the very least, he would have fewer flaws to seize on, and he wouldn’t aggressively attack people…</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou was no pushover.</p><p>He was only troubled for a brief moment before he spoke again:</p><p>“Let’s do this instead, I don’t want your ‘Hu,’ let’s have a more equal contest, one that is absolutely fair.”</p><p>“The stakes have been set by you; if you win, I’m yours.”</p><p>“So, if I win, you’re mine, how about that?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
