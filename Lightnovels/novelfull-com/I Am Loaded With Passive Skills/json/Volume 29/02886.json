After it was shattered, that axe should be Ran Ming, who hooked back three fragments of the heavenly realm and threw them into the Shengshen Continent’s Four Symbols Secret Realm…”</p><p>“Is this the origin of the ‘Divine Relics’?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s breathing suddenly became heavier.</p><p>Right from the start, if the position was so high, perhaps Li Fugui wasn’t joking. Something like “Ancestral God Fate Chart” could really exist!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou became more focused, hoping to read more information from these external, unobtainable pieces of intel.</p><p>But in his mind, the images and lights shuttled through, after the divine battle, there was a long blur, where nothing could be understood.</p><p>“Did Ran Ming also die, so powerless…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought wildly, then again remembered the information he had been able to get just now, apparently, there was an “Ancestral Tree”?</p><p>“Yes, those three pieces of heavenly realm hooked over, if just thrown towards a continent like that, could only cause devastating natural disasters, and couldn’t constitute a ‘legacy.'”</p><p>“To integrate the three world fragments into one ‘Divine Ruins’, in the manner of an extradimensional space, hidden within the Four Symbols Secret Realm, then indeed, like my Apricot Realm, it would only be possible by planting a tree to connect them.”</p><p>“That is to say, the Divine Relics, at the very least, have one Ancestral Tree!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes heated up; this information also wasn’t provided by Li Fugui.</p><p>He was now very interested in planting trees, after all, he was already raising an entire world in his own home, the city was built, people were present, how could one Dragon Apricot be enough?</p><p>To develop a greater world like that of the Shengshen Continent, he would need to gather at least nine to summon a celestial dragon, right?</p><p>He had already gathered the Dragon Apricot, Divne Worship Willow Fragment, Bodhi Ancient Wood Fragment, Blood Tree Fragment.</p><p>None of these were likely to appear in Divine Relics.</p><p>What remained, the Nine Sacrificial Osmanthus was at Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, the ancient japonicum was at the Mournful Emperor realm, and the Sword Hemp was in the well-known Burial Sword Tomb at the Eastern Mountain.</p><p>“It could only be the Ashvattha or the Di Ying Holy Plant!”</p><p>The Ashvattha could give birth to heavenly flames and had once nurtured a holy emperor-level figure like the Great Infernal Ancestor. Its strength could be imagined.</p><p>Di Ying Holy Plant… Xu Xiaoshou narrowed his eyes.</p><p>What was that?</p><p>Do I just remember a name?</p><p>The images in his mind gradually became solid again, slightly more visible, and Xu Xiaoshou quickly refocused.</p><p>The divine battle was over.</p><p>Now, one could only vaguely see an island—the Divine Relics!</p><p>Like the Abyss Island, it was situated in the boundless chaos.</p><p>But the Abyss Island could still return to the continent; the chaos that the Divine Relics were rooted in didn’t seem like spacetime turbulence but rather seemed to stand alone outside of the Shengshen Continent…</p><p>The only connection might be now shouting “Ran Ming” and being guided there!</p><p>The Divine Relics, or the Divine Island, seemed small compared to the previously seen “Thirty-Three Heavens,” divided into upper, middle, and lower levels, resembling a pyramid that grew smaller as it went up.</p><p>“It’s those triangular heavenly domain fragments!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered and felt that the Divine Relics still emulated the suspected “Divine Realm” Thirty-Three Heavens structure.</p><p>But what special purpose did this structure serve in the Divine Relics?</p><p>Soon, the voice of the divine priest Ran Ming appeared in the mind.</p><p>Still hollow, still void, still ethereal, it didn’t sound like a real person, it must have been the sound of the legacy manifesting through intent, left behind at that time:</p><p>“The Divine Relics, forged from the triangle of the God Realm, are called the first realm, the Eighteen Heavens, the Thirty-Three Heavens…”</p><p>“The Divine Relics, forged a myriad of Great Paths, constructed the ladder of reincarnation, treasures abound, fate completely bound, all goodness exists here, and all evil is also present…”</p><p>This time, the voice of the god slayer was very clear, and the message was quite straightforward.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou listened intently; between the lines, Ran Ming was simply contrasting how strong he was and how many treasures there were in the Divine Relics.</p><p>But soon, they were all no longer yours… Xu Xiaoshou mused to himself, listening for a long time, until he finally heard the key message:</p><p>“Those who seek the legacy, discern me, transcend and Super Taoize, ascend the Feather Ascension Three Realms, and see the true name.”</p><p>“Next, gather eighteen Life Stars of God, inherit the Ancestral God Fate Chart.”</p><p>“Lastly, seal the Ancestral God Ranking, each with their own reward.”</p><p>With that, the incessant pleading came to an end, and all the images in the mind shattered, turning into a solemn and sacred Shadow of Divine.</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
