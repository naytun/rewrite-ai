Lord Shou, spare us—”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi also shuddered, “Impossible!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stopped mid-air, his eyes brightening, “Is Elder Zhong joining my First Pavilion in the Sky?”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi was at a loss for words for a moment and after a long while, he said, “The Holy Divine Palace has not treated me badly…”</p><p>Seeing Xu Xiaoshou’s expression change, he quickly added, “But you can’t kill Jade Capital City either!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately seemed like a deeply wronged housewife, speaking mournfully, “You want this, and you want that, why don’t you do like Elder Fang, and have me leave the First Pavilion in the Sky to join Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe under Dao Xuanji’s command and aid you as a fellow accomplice?”</p><p>Fang Wenxin felt dejected, but inwardly cursed at the young man’s veiled insinuations.</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi was extremely conflicted, pondering back and forth but still found no good solution, finally pleading, “Spare Jade Capital City, give me this favor…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou closed his eyes in resignation and said coldly,</p><p>“Elder Zhong, we stand on opposing sides. Saying such overly intimate words doesn’t seem appropriate, does it?”</p><p>“My First Pavilion in the Sky has its demi-saints, more than one at that. I too possess all attributes and have mastered the Great Path Diagram…”</p><p>“How should I explain to myself and to the people of my First Pavilion in the Sky—that I spared the enemy, spared Jade Capital City, must also spare Dao Xuanji, and even become a traitor who reneges on pre-war bets, all just to give you, Elder Zhong, a favor?”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi had mixed feelings, and just as he was about to speak.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou mocked himself with a laugh and then blocked him off by saying, “You want not just identity, you want Jade Capital City, you want everything, and then after you’re settled, you want to make it difficult for me, Xu Xiaoshou, huh.”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi opened his mouth, “Ah bah ah…”</p><p>Jade Capital City fell collectively silent.</p><p>Fang Wenxin gasped in shock, this wretch! This wretch!</p><p>Mei Siren, Lei Shuangxing and the others from his own side had convulsing expressions. Indeed, compared to Xu Xiaoshou’s combat power, his tongue was unbeatable!</p><p>Utter silence prevailed.</p><p>The despair of Jade Capital City was evident to all.</p><p>At this moment, Zhong Yuanzi, full of self-loathing, wished he could just grab the sword from Xu Xiaoshou’s hand and kill himself!</p><p>He treated me with such respect, yet I behaved like a mere person…</p><p>I am guilty!</p><p>What should I do? Teach me, who will teach me, Little Dao… Oh, Little Dao is gone.</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi gazed upward lifelessly, looked around, and realized Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe was not as it used to be, not even comparable to making one’s heart race like a Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Fine!”</p><p>Just then!</p><p>Just as he, Zhong Yuanzi, was speechless and unable to convey his thoughts!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou exclaimed loudly, and then firmly stated, “Even if I bear ten thousand infamies, today I, Xu Xiaoshou, will grant you, Elder Zhong, this favor. I will not massacre Jade Capital City!” He threw up his hand.</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi’s expression brightened, and as he looked up, he saw a hint of unfamiliarity in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes.</p><p>His heart tightened, and he instinctively stepped forward, but felt as if something was moving away from him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou retreated, shaking his head, his voice cold and resentful, “But though the death penalty can be avoided, the living penalty cannot be evaded…or rather, Jade Capital City should naturally come to be under my control, Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>The people of Jade Capital City heard this and all felt joy.</p><p>Some felt that something was off, what was there to be happy about? But they were simply relieved, at least they had survived…</p><p>“Young Master Xu, what do you mean?” asked Zhong Yuanzi eagerly.</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou gave Elder Zhong a deep look, retreated another step, and made no reply, quickly withdrawing his gaze.</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi felt an empty void in his heart, like sand slipping through fingers, elusive and ungraspable.</p><p>Feng Zhongzui hurriedly directed the Dao Imparting Mirror towards Lord Shou, utterly unable to guess what path Lord Shou would take now.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>Just then, a Space Power Upanishad Formation unfolded in the skies above Jade Capital City.</p><p>The array swept across all directions, beyond sight, boundless and vast, almost covering the entire Jade Capital City.</p><p>Inside the city, tens of millions of people, aside from old friends, the sick, and various mortals, and those who had previously fled, there still were at least several hundred thousand, if not a million, Spiritual Cultivators.</p><p>Each one felt terror, feeling infinitely small, their life and death hanging by a thread from the whims of the youth above.</p><p>Fang Wenxin and Zhong Yuanzi looked on, unclear of the reasons.</p><p>Mei Siren, Gu Yu, Feng Tingchen, Li Fuyu and others also gazed, uncertain.</p><p>Only Lei Xi’er, looking at the array covering the entire Jade Capital City, saw something astonishing in her God Devil Eyes, her head bowed in contemplation.</p><p>People of the five regions murmured non-stop, equally showing perplexity, not understanding what exactly Lord Shou had in mind.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Suddenly, like thunder, the Xuanji great array covering Jade Capital City started self-destructing substantially, its surface becoming crazily tainted with “divine path patterns” like a virus.</p><p>Lord Shou, high in the sky, suddenly had veins bulging on his forehead, his entire being seemed to be straining, but it was unclear against what.</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>This was not yet the end; he transformed into a Golden Giant, then expanded to a towering size, as the Spatial Upanishad array beneath his feet smashed down, plunging into the underground of the entire Jade Capital City.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Fang Wenxin and Zhong Yuanzi just felt something was wrong, when they heard Dao Xuanji’s voice filled with shock and rage:</p><p>“Stop him!”</p><p>“Quick, stop him!”</p><p>“He’s destroying the Xuanji great array, he’s going to…”</p><p>The voice suddenly stopped.</p><p>Underneath the Ultimate Giant, the Spatial Upanishad shone brilliantly, like a flat round white sun.</p><p>The space surrounding Jade Capital City, at that moment, seemed to disconnect from the entire world, including sounds, images, spiritual energy, Way of the Heavens, rules…</p><p>Everyone realized something was wrong.</p><p>But before they could act, a voice, utterly arrogant and cold, spread through the arena mirror across the five domains of the continent:</p><p>“Jade Capital is but a birdcage, a gilded canary.”</p><p>“As the master outside the cage changes, so it enters my Apricot Realm.”</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Space shifted.</p><p>As the world outside the mirror looked on, saints, Spiritual Cultivators, ancient swordsmen on the city’s battlements stared…</p><p>The vast Jade Capital City had vanished without a trace!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
