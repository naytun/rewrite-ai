burning down not only two of their own, but the entire Jade Capital City in the end…” Of course, Elder Yu would never dare say this last bit of slander aloud.</p><p>After sending his great-granddaughter back to the mountain, he felt like a Buddha.</p><p>Only resenting that when Little Dao betrayed the Holy Divine Palace, he didn’t take Elder Yu along for the fun.</p><p>Now, staying in the great hall, besides envying Elder Wuyue and Wei Feng for their freedom to rove outside, he secretly prayed that Hallmaster Xuanji wouldn’t call on him again.</p><p>I want to slack off, not fight!</p><p>“…Mystical Gate?”</p><p>“Yes, after this strike, I fear Elder Gu won’t last much longer.”</p><p>In the front, Dao Xuanji continued to inquire from Xi about the emotion sword technique, the latter’s tone tinged with sadness.</p><p>But now, having to uphold the situation, Hallmaster Xuanji, who must become the backbone in everyone’s eyes, rarely showed too fluctuating emotions anymore.</p><p>“He dares to…” Dao Xuanji showed just a hint of regret, then quickly returned to calm.</p><p>For her, Gu Yu was just a dispensable pawn.</p><p>She had just taken office and was indeed missing a handy sword, one that might stand up to Elder Wuyue or Rao Yaoyao — Beibei was too young to shoulder this responsibility.</p><p>If only Gu Yu hadn’t pushed so hard, hadn’t been so decisive.</p><p>Even if he couldn’t bring down Xu Xiaoshou, just a slight hint of submission upon returning would probably have earned him a demi-saint person rank from her.</p><p>But alas, the ancient swordsman’s nature was too stubborn.</p><p>That was also expected, after all, Gu Yu had earlier made clear he was used to a free-spirited life and couldn’t be used by her.</p><p>If useless, better to eliminate early, no need to worry more!</p><p>But still…</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s gaze swept over the faces of those around her, full of zest but still somewhat youthful, the only one with a full beard merely a big bald man uttering soft cries.</p><p>She fell silent too.</p><p>It’s difficult for a clever wife to cook without rice.</p><p>Divine Sorcerers were never ones to charge ahead in battle; she finally realized it, but why did the Holy Divine Palace just have to be stuck during her tenure, without any capable warriors!</p><p>Passing over several expectant gazes, Dao Xuanji finally rested her eyes on the somewhat evasive Elder Yu.</p><p>“Elder Yu, the battle of the Sword Deity has ended, what insight do you have for the upcoming situation?”</p><p>Elder Yu sighed to himself, what he feared had still arrived.</p><p>What insights do I have, ask me thirty years ago, then I could have told you quite a bit.</p><p>Now?</p><p>When Little Dao betrayed the sacred mountain, he packed up the brains of us old men while he was at it!</p><p>Despite the internal complaints, Elder Yu knew well how to play dumb; his dead fish eyes blinked twice, and he quickly looked around with a confused yet slightly hopeful expression, mumbling:</p><p>“Pastries?”</p><p>“What pastries?”</p><p>“Now that you mention it, I am a bit hungry too…”</p><p>The Saint Hall went quiet immediately.</p><p>Dao Xuanji wasn’t someone who couldn’t take a joke, but at this moment, she really wasn’t in the mood for fun, “I said ‘insight’, not ‘pastries’.”</p><p>This wasn’t even the same sound!</p><p>All the young people were standing, all staring wide-eyed at him, but Elder Yu was long past the age of embarrassment.</p><p>“Creeeak—”</p><p>He pulled out his own chair, sat down with his legs crossed, and after a chuckled ‘heh’, rested his left hand on the table while raising his right.</p><p>That’s it!</p><p>Everyone stared at him like that.</p><p>And he stared back at Hallmaster Xuanji like that.</p><p>Dao Xuanji waited three breaths, her eyes narrowing, “What do you mean?”</p><p>Elder Yu was amused; after finishing a scuffle outside, he’d developed a rebellious spirit, knowing that relentless evasion would only embolden his foes, so he said, “This is my insight, when Little Dao was around, this was how we all were.”</p><p>Dao Xuanji almost didn’t catch on.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
