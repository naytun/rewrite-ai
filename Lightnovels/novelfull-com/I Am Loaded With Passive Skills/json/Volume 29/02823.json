Are there really Nians without attributes? And such exquisite control…”</p><p>Then it turned into muttering to himself:</p><p>“Aside from the old man and me, is there someone else who understands the oppression-type?”</p><p>This outcry made many ancient swordsmen on the scene, who were still pondering over the sharpness of “Open Sword”, look back in unison.</p><p>They spotted a burly little giant running from afar, who turned out to be Cao Erzhu.</p><p>Cao Erzhu felt a bit shaky under the scrutiny of so many demi-saints.</p><p>The old man was so right; the higher void is full of dogs, demi-saints around every corner, with Upanishads as common as dirt—the world of Spiritual Cultivation is terrifying. You really can’t mingle carelessly!</p><p>With that in mind, after being blown away by the Xuanji Star Official, Cao Erzhu simply faded out of the battlefield. After all, Brother Shou could handle it himself.</p><p>It wasn’t until he noticed the oppression-type Penetrating Divine Senses that he couldn’t help but reveal himself, wanting to make a new friend.</p><p>“This, this is also Penetrating Divine Senses?”</p><p>Mei Siren withdrew his gaze from Erzhu with no suspicion.</p><p>Looking back at Li Fuyu, he finally felt that the post-“Open Sword” aura and pressure, similar to the one exerted by the sword image, shared a certain mastery of the same craft.</p><p>It’s just that the former emphasized a more tangible sense of oppression, while the sword image focused more on attack power; there was still a bit of difference.</p><p>“Oppression-type?”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui’s eyes lit up.</p><p>This looked like another Boss, who also understood Penetrating Divine Senses?</p><p>As he operated the Dao Imparting Mirror, he landed beside Cao Erzhu, “My fellow, you understand Penetrating Divine Senses well?”</p><p>Cao Erzhu waved his hands in negation: “No, no, I just have a bit of understanding…”</p><p>“Why not share with us, then?”</p><p>“Ah, this… the old man said that there are six kinds of Penetrating Divine Senses: basic type, possession-type, domain-type, release-type, oppression-type, and manipulation-type. This Miss Li is a very typical oppression-type, purely compelling with the force of her intent; cultivated deeply, one could open their eyes to annihilate Saints…”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui was baffled, what’s going on, are you really going to tell it?</p><p>And you’re so authoritative about it?</p><p>There are six kinds of Penetrating Divine Senses?</p><p>And they’re classified by your old man?</p><p>You blurted that out as if your father was Kui Leihan. Dare to blatantly divide these things, even the Eighth Sword Deity wouldn’t dare claim that his second-generation Penetrating Divine Senses sword cognition has six kinds of morph forms… states…</p><p>Feng Zhongzui’s thoughts suddenly stalled, and his hand also shook:</p><p>“Brother, what is your honored surname?”</p><p>“My name is Cao… Oh, my surname is Luo, you can call me Rock Luo.” Cao Erzhu scratched his head sheepishly.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Feng Zhongzui’s Dao Imparting Mirror dropped to the ground, he stared dumbfounded at the big guy.</p><p>Not only him, but Feng Tingchen, Yang Xizhi, Lei Shuangxing, Xuan Wuji, and other arrivals, also turned back in shock, or by sight, or with their spiritual senses, they began to scrutinize this self-deceiving little giant.</p><p>Throughout the lands of the five regions, the Dao Imparting Mirror only showed the sky and the snowflakes frozen in place. The next moment, everyone burst into action.</p><p>“Damn it, pick up the mirror, you damned Feng Zhongzui, what kind of broadcast is this, I haven’t gotten a clear look at him yet!”</p><p>“Penetrating Divine Senses are divided into six kinds? Isn’t that… what did I just see, is that Kui Leihan’s son?”</p><p>“After the Ten High Nobles!”</p><p>“Truly the first descendant of the Ten High Nobles! Kui Leihan actually has a son? I, I, I… I’ve gone mad. I wanted to marry him, and now there’s a son of the Ten High Nobles I can see? I want to go there! A son works too!”</p><p>…</p><p>The world on the other side of the Dao Imparting Mirror couldn’t disrupt the current battle at all.</p><p>Li Fuyu, after repelling the protection, felt her Sword Will climb with the sword as it was unsheathed bit by bit, and she muttered to herself:</p><p>“I held a sword at three, entered the path at six, and spent twenty-four years in sword observation at the sword tower.”</p><p>“Among the Nine Major Sword Techniques, apart from my emotion sword technique which still lacks maturity, I have gained something from the rest.”</p><p>Her cool voice, though a murmur, resonated with the snowflake sword energy and propagated outside.</p><p>Mei Siren, Feng Tingchen, and other ancient swordsmen promptly turned their heads back, looking towards the battlefield.</p><p>Feng Zhongzui picked up the Dao Imparting Mirror, daring not to slap it around anymore, and instead focused the mirror on the battlefield.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, not quite understanding her intentions, was simultaneously sensing this unique oppression-type Penetrating Divine Senses and comparing it to that of Kui Leihan’s, he asked,</p><p>“So?”</p><p>Li Fuyu’s eyes slightly narrowed, drawing her protector sword out to just half a finger’s breadth from its sheath. The Sword Intent within spiraled and coiled, climbing and transforming until it reached an apex.</p><p>For a moment, her chilling voice was colder than the wind and snow, piercing to the bone:</p><p>“The sword tower’s Sword Humans, through the ages have not contended with the world.”</p><p>“Since being uniquely blessed, cultivating for a duration tens of times longer than yours, and still must bring you back to the building, I ought to bind my own domain, and should not act with full intent…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was taken aback.</p><p>He actually understood that.</p><p>Was Li Fuyu, priding herself as an unparalleled Sword Human descendant of the sword tower, suggesting she would suppress her domain to fight him?</p><p>“That won’t be necessary!”</p><p>He laughed and interrupted, “You have your sword tower, and I am not without my own support. If we’re going to fight, you should just do your best. No need to hold back.”</p><p>But that was underestimating Li Fuyu’s resolve.</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>When her hand-held protector Sword Will extended to an extreme, as if about to burst forth, Li Fuyu sheathed her sword.</p><p>Swish.</p><p>The frozen flakes of snow in the sky, as if time had resumed from a pause, returned to their gently falling state.</p><p>After Li Fuyu sheathed her sword, her aura not decreased but instead increased, explosive air currents burst forth from beneath her feet while her green hair held up by bamboo pins cascaded down to her waist, her eyes shooting forth a gloomy and dark sword light.</p><p>“You are not adept at Swordless Sword Technique nor Phantom Swords Technique, I shall use the Swordless Sword Technique and Phantom Swords Technique to fight you,” Li Fuyu declared.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was taken aback after hearing this.</p><p>How do you know I’m not good at this… No, I’m actually quite skilled at these two, you must be dreaming!</p><p>“As you wish.”</p><p>Ancient swordsmen were stubborn donkeys; since advising once was useless, Xu Xiaoshou wouldn’t insist.</p><p>He had just brought out Hidden Bitter, thinking that perhaps he should teach her a lesson using the Fourth Sword or Flame Python…</p><p>Suddenly, Li Fuyu set down her protector sword!</p><p>Right there, at her feet!</p><p>“What do you mean by this?” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyelids twitched furiously.</p><p>Li Fuyu’s red lips parted slightly:</p><p>“Swordless Sword Technique.”</p><p>The ancient swordsmen present at the scene, and the spectators outside through the Dao Imparting Mirror were all ignited and exploded with excitement.</p><p>“So arrogant!”</p><p>“She’s even more arrogant than Lord Shou!”</p><p>“This Miss Li is fierce and succinct, does she truly have the skills, or is she going to get beaten badly by Lord Shou later?”</p><p>“I feel so slighted, won’t Lord Shou stand up for himself? Really teach her a lesson?”</p><p>Okay, okay, okay… Xu Xiaoshou was amused by his own anger.</p><p>A Swordless Sword Technique teaching session?</p><p>You, Li Fuyu, want to teach me a lesson?</p><p>He was so choked up for a moment that he didn’t know how to respond, only able to sigh and acknowledge that true ancient swordsmen knew how to pretend.</p><p>Swords were drawn, tensions running high!</p><p>As the battlefield atmosphere soared to a peak with just a few words, his opponent on the other hand could afford the leisure to bow respectfully and say,</p><p>“Sword tower, Li Fuyu.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also suppressed the raging waves in his chest, carefully put away Hidden Bitter, and said with calmness:</p><p>“First Pavilion in the Sky, Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>The view from the Dao Imparting Mirror suddenly expanded to envelop the entire battlefield, for Feng Zhongzui also understood the Swordless Sword Technique.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>It was merely a moment.</p><p>Above the old site of Jade Capital City, each snowflake burst open with astonishing “Nian,” as if it had been endowed with “spirits.”</p><p>The snowflakes turned into a blizzard, chaotic and wildly dancing.</p><p>The blizzard clouded everyone’s vision, and the images in the mirror from the Dao Imparting Mirror suddenly shifted.</p><p>After that, only Li Fuyu’s swaying green sword robe and her cold voice dispersing could be heard:</p><p>“Swordless Sword Technique…”</p><p>“No-Self Sword Step!”</p><p>The perception-enhanced Xu Xiaoshou suddenly stiffened.</p><p>In that instant, he lost sight of Li Fuyu’s trace, only able to see her clothes torn apart by Sword Will as they fell.</p><p>At the same time, the ancient swordsmen at the edge of the battlefield were all moved, even Mei Siren couldn’t help but step forward half a step, her face revealing shock.</p><p>Feng Zhongzui, holding the Dao Imparting Mirror, shouted and retreated, fearing being caught up in the battlefield:</p><p>“Sword Steps? Ancient Sword Steps?”</p><p>“Is it that long-lost Ancient Sword Steps, the God of Sword, Gu Louying’s Ancient Sword Steps?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
