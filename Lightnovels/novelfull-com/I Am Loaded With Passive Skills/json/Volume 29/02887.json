Only this residual image left? How mediocre…”</p><p>With no response, he had to change his approach:</p><p>“I spoke to the Heavenly Ancestor, bore the Sword God in my heart, attained the Great Path with the Dragon Ancestor, and battled the evil god, have touched both Holy and Demon Power, have half-mastered the Upanishad of life and death. Give me a chance, shall we talk?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pulled out all the stops, feeling that these were all Ran Ming was familiar with, not much more.</p><p>Suddenly, Xu Xiaoshou thought of something.</p><p>“Kong Yuhen, do you recognize him?”</p><p>He even pulled out the only connection he had among the Ten Ancestors, just unsure if this connection was real…</p><p>The god-slayer Ran Ming remained unresponsive.</p><p>Regrettably, it seemed like he was just a puppet.</p><p>The strange thing was, if one did not count the time Xu Xiaoshou spent talking to himself, the image of Ran Ming should have gradually faded away after completing everything, and yet it had lingered in Xu Xiaoshou’s mind for quite some time!</p><p>Perhaps, it had really listened?</p><p>Disdaining to respond?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought back to when he and Bazhun’an went to meet the Heavenly Ancestor… indeed, a deity would disdain conversing with ants, just like he wouldn’t ordinarily respond to an ant’s questions now.</p><p>Unless the ant was very arrogant, possessing the power to slay the gods!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, mimicking his past self, turned haughty and coldly shouted:</p><p>“For generations, there has been no one like me, this genius. For ten thousand years, no higher man has emerged. I will count to three, if you don’t come out to meet me, you’ll lose your chance.”</p><p>“Three!”</p><p>The words had barely left his mouth.</p><p>The residual image of Ran Ming disappeared.</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was left embarrassed on the spot.</p><p>Fortunately, there were no bystanders…</p><p>No, the process was right, but why was the result wrong? Looking down on me?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou remembered, weren’t Ran Ming and the Heavenly Ancestor good friends?</p><p>The “The fate of all good” Shattered Shield given by the Heavenly Ancestor was in the Ran Ming ruins, waiting to aid the Saint Servant!</p><p>“Strange indeed, you must have heard…”</p><p>“Do I have a problem? I’m sure I have no issue! It must be Ran Ming that has a problem…”</p><p>As his vision gradually cleared, and he could see his surroundings, Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his chin, furrowing his brows in deep thought, and his mind raced:</p><p>“Could it be that Ran Ming is deaf?”</p><p>In the Divine Ruins, the air wasn’t only filled with ordinary Heaven and Earth spiritual energy but also with Holy Power!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, looking at the strand of pure Holy Power flowing before his eyes, was taken aback with awe.</p><p>Good heavens…</p><p>What kind of divine place was this?</p><p>“Hiss.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou swallowed it in one gulp, savoring the treat while feeling a bit sympathetic towards others.</p><p>Those who had not ingested the Holy Miracle Fruit.</p><p>Those without the special opportunity to produce the first strand of Holy Power within their energy reserve.</p><p>Any Spiritual Cultivator below the demi-saint would dare not ingest the wild Holy Power from Heaven and Earth.</p><p>Because that wasn’t a Holy Miracle Fruit, but unrefined berserk energy, ingestion would surely lead to death!</p><p>To see such a tremendous opportunity float by right before one’s eyes, unable to be gathered…</p><p>“The higher void is literally weeping next door!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cheerfully walked forward, and in less than a tea’s time, unowned Holy Power was available to be ingested again.</p><p>He gulped it down in one bite.</p><p>No need for detailed calculations, he simply swallowed as usual.</p><p>After leaving the Ran Ming ruins, his master stage in Spiritual Cultivation would likely be no different from an ordinary demi-saint person in the outside world.</p><p>Even due to his robust constitution, he could swallow more Holy Power here, while other demi-saints had an upper limit!</p><p>Along the way, Xu Xiaoshou verified many things.</p><p>Firstly, the concentration of the Heaven and Earth spiritual energy was strikingly different. Just outside, there were ordinaries places where one could swallow Holy Power; finding a Sacred Secret Land would mean endless Holy Power!</p><p>“It is indeed the Divine Realm, God State, Thirty Three Heavens!”</p><p>Secondly, gravity was different, constraints were different, the rules, the Great Path, all were distinct here.</p><p>Here, there seemed to be no such thing as treasures being self-concealed; all could radiate their brilliance freely because the rules here were of a higher level.</p><p>The most obvious thing was that Xu Xiaoshou’s “Breathing Technique” was fully activated. Yet, now he could only swallow the spiritual energy within a ten-mile radius instead of thousands of miles.</p><p>And “Spatial Upanishad,” “Life Upanishad,” “Way of the Sword” and such, felt as if they had dropped from 80% to about 50% or 60%.</p><p>“This feeling of constraint…”</p><p>“No, it’s not ‘constraint,’ could it be that the Great Path here is more complete, allowing for greater enlightenment?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou recalled that Ran Ming had mentioned wanting him to inherit his three paths, which varied in rank.</p><p>Li Fugui spoke of the “Ancestral God Fate Chart,” which ranked only second.</p><p>First, he spoke of “Discerning oneself, Super Taoization, Feather Ascension Three Realms, to see the true name”…</p><p>“Discern what is ‘self’?”</p><p>“Transcending the Path Principles… Super Taoization, these three words, feel a bit like surpassing the feeling of an 80% Great Dao Disc…”</p><p>“Feather Ascension Three Realms, here the ‘Realm’ refers to the ‘God State.’ The three Realms would then mean the Triangular God State, implying Divine Relics…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gazed toward the murky sky, contemplative.</p><p>“From this First Heavens, Super Taoization ‘Ascension’ to the Eighteen Heavens, then ascension to Thirty Three Heavens…”</p><p>“To see the true name, does that mean being able to see the real god slayer, or his inheritance, to gain more?”</p><p>“Next would be acquiring the ancestral God Fate Chart, and lastly, those on the Ancestral God Ranking receive a consolation prize?”</p><p>Super Taoization, successive ascensions… indeed, it seemed somewhat fantastical.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly knew why Li Fugui only spoke of the method of inheritance like “Ancestral God Fate Chart”—perhaps the first method was such that, besides the Ten High Nobles, no one else even had the slightest qualification to consider it!</p><p>“It seems, Ai Gou didn’t just lose a little, but a massive amount, a blood loss indeed!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused.</p><p>The enemy’s loss is my gain.</p><p>He hadn’t received anything yet, but he already felt overwhelmingly fulfilled.</p><p>Looking at it, Dao Xuanji was truly a genius, a stroke of genius with every move, a talent among the talents at the sacred mountain.</p><p>“Calm down, calm down…”</p><p>“I can gain even more, let’s set a small goal first, plucking feathers as the goose passes, take all that can be taken, quickly pass through the Divine Relics!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickly returned to reality.</p><p>Super Taoization, he himself did not dare to think too much about it for the moment, as he was still uncertain if it was as he suspected.</p><p>And as for the Ten Ancestors…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt neither reverence nor could he trust them completely.</p><p>He vaguely remembered, while the Heavenly Ancestor had indeed passed down a legacy to him, it was also a malicious being, not a good god.</p><p>If he had made the slightest mistake, he feared he would have been played to the extent that nothing would remain, then was Ran Ming really a benevolent god?</p><p>He must remain cautious…</p><p>“Ancestral God Ranking!”</p><p>Returning to reality, the reality was that the ‘Ancestral God Fate Chart’ was the immediate necessity; even if he didn’t want it, he couldn’t leave it for the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>This thing, above the demi-saint person position and Holy Emperor person, was essential for becoming Gods and ancestor.</p><p>“Eighteen God Fated Stars seal the list, and once the trial concludes, those that acquire an ‘Ancestral God Fate Chart’ alongside the others getting their consolation prizes will head back to their respective homes.”</p><p>“The Ran Ming ruins wasn’t just idly sitting by; whoever won the God Fated Star, wherever they are now, all would be listed.”</p><p>“This so-called ‘Ancestral God Ranking’ is essentially a ‘Hunting List’ that, upon the conclusion of everything, would appear in the palm of the left hand.”</p><p>In his mind, after Li Fugui’s words ended, Xu Xiaoshou looked at his own left hand and indeed found a faint ax mark in the center of his palm.</p><p>With a probe of his spiritual senses.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>A scroll of illusory imagery unfolded before him, wordless and formless.</p><p>But upon observing, this wordless scroll could visualize the imagery most fitting of ‘Ancestral God Ranking’ in everyone’s mind.</p><p>After a blink of Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes, from having gained nothing, he could now see a name.</p><p>And speaking of which, that name was quite familiar!</p><p>“Ancestral God Ranking.”</p><p>“First, Zhou Tianshen, six.”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
