His devilish laughter grew more piercing and unrestrained, startling everyone watching the Dao Imparting Mirror in the Eighth Palace.</p><p>He just held his head, frantically shaking it, rhythmically mumbling:</p><p>“Heavenly Map, Life Pattern, Innate Saint Ability…”</p><p>“I’ve realized it, I understand now, my Path can now be realized!”</p><p>His speech suddenly picked up speed. Qiao Qianzhi’s gaze was vacant, yet he started muttering at an extreme speed:</p><p>“Everything displayed by mortal objects is a pattern, and every action of mortals shows something external…”</p><p>“Through stone, observe man and man shall become stone; through saints, observe man and man can only become a saint…”</p><p>“To seek the Ancestral God Realm, one must inspect the Ancestral God Map; to desire the pattern Dao Method, heaven corresponds to earth first…”</p><p>“The law of men, the law of scenes, the law of heaven, the law of rules, the law for others, the law for oneself, the law of the heart, the law of truth…”</p><p>“Manifest the spirit, the soul, the body, the divinity, the intent, the energy, the force, the thought…”</p><p>The voice grew louder!</p><p>The content grew more bizarre!</p><p>“Are you freaking sick?” Xiao Qixiu, overwhelmed by the barrage of words he couldn’t understand, slapped him across the face.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Suddenly, a wave of Holy Power exploded in the Eighth Palace.</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivator in front of the Dao Imparting Mirror, the Feng family’s Mirror Holder, Fu Xing, Fu Yinhong, and every life form in the vicinity suddenly saw darkness and fainted.</p><p>“Damn it! Old Qiao, you…”</p><p>Xiao Qixiu was thrown into the air, incredulously watching Qiao Qianzhi below him whose body was continuously producing waves of Holy Power.</p><p>He’s going insane, going mad!</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi, is he about to become a saint?</p><p>That’s not right, this guy is just at the Sovereign Stage…</p><p>Ever since he began to deviate at the Holy Palace, he decided to modify his path to focus on patterns, left the Holy Palace, came to Tiansang Spirit Palace, and up to now, he has made no progress!</p><p>Moreover, because of his long absence from battle and focusing only on research, his battle consciousness was degenerating. For decades, he had only become a spirit array master at the trash level of Sovereign, a mere Spiritual Cultivator!</p><p>And now, he’s about to break through?</p><p>And to break through to sanctification?</p><p>“You freaking sick man!”</p><p>Suddenly, Xiao Qixiu was at a loss for words, left with nothing but that phrase.</p><p>From the Cutting Path higher void to demi-saint, there are so many realms you haven’t experienced yet. How can you leap over so many levels to instantly become sanctified?</p><p>Are you also Cen Qiaofu?</p><p>Can you also achieve enlightenment overnight?</p><p>At this moment, Xiao Qixiu’s eyes reddened.</p><p>Why is it not me who’s enlightened? What virtues and capabilities does this Old Qiao have, how does he deserve it?</p><p>“Old Xiao, I need to go back for a bit,” Qiao Qianzhi, after being slapped across the face, completely woke up and looking around at the fluctuating energies, his eyes shone brightly.</p><p>“Come back here! Clear up the situation first!” Xiao Qixiu approached with sword drawn, his aura fierce.</p><p>“There’s no time, I need to go into seclusion for a while, listen to my advice…” Qiao Qianzhi couldn’t wait any longer, quickly fled towards the direction of Tiansang Spirit Palace, and soon turned into a speck of shadow.</p><p>“What advice!” Xiao Qixiu glanced at the people fainting in the Eighth Palace, unable to just leave and ignore them, and could only shout.</p><p>“Remember! Do not become sanctified, do not use the position of demi-saint!”</p><p>“Huh? Are you sick?”</p><p>“Trust me, don’t use it, that’s not… the correct answer… the limit… it has…”</p><p>“What? What are you saying? Then what should I use?” Xiao Qixiu could no longer see the figure, and his responses grew more intermittent.</p><p>“…” No response.</p><p>“Use what! Speak up, you madman!”</p><p>“…” No response at all.</p><p>Xiao Qixiu took a deep breath, holding back his anger.</p><p>With a flick of his sleeve, he formed a sword from spiritual energy, transformed it into the five elements, commanded it to form an array, and associated it with wood.</p><p>Soon, the people who were stunned in the Eighth Palace gradually awoke amidst the rich vitality.</p><p>“What kind of dumb luck, what kind of freak talent? Observing a battle led to a breakthrough?” The more Xiao Qixiu thought about it, the more he couldn’t calm down, the more irritated he felt.</p><p>Just as he decided to forget this nauseating matter, the people who just woke up in the Eighth Palace suddenly shuddered and then fainted again.</p><p>Holy will!</p><p>Xiao Qixiu tensed up, not yet drawing his sword.</p><p>But from above the Nine Heavens, down dropped the etherial Saint Language, boundless and purifying the soul:</p><p>“What heaven and earth bestow, there is nothing that cannot be used.”</p><p>Xiao Qixiu’s eyes trembled, he froze in place, deeply remembering this sentence, desperately furrowing his brow trying to enter the state of Divine Enlightenment but couldn’t.</p><p>What does it mean?</p><p>That which heaven and earth bestow…</p><p>What comes after that?</p><p>…</p><p>Cutting Path!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes suddenly snapped open, his microcosmic orbit’s spiritual source gathered completely into his energy reserve, and inside his body, cycles of spatial worlds began to form and fade.</p><p>He had broken through…</p><p>From the Sovereign Dao Realm to Cutting Path, the breakthrough was countless times simpler than imagined, and…</p><p>“Passive Points: 71663588.”</p><p>The passive points hadn’t even dropped below seventy million.</p><p>After advancing to Cutting Path, Xu Xiaoshou immediately exchanged for a Profound Dao Seed, bound it to the Fire Path Wheel, and planted it in the Field of Profound Dao.</p><p>“Fire Path Wheel (19%).”</p><p>“Fire Path Wheel (20%).”</p><p>The progress increased by “1%”!</p><p>This proved that the functionality of the Field of Profound Dao could be used in Cutting Path too, allowing for breakthroughs to employ Mang’s Upanishad!</p><p>“My guess was indeed correct, I am a genius!”</p><p>Feeling relieved.</p><p>The insights that he had no time to digest earlier, came rushing in.</p><p>The Spatial Upanishad was incredibly powerful, especially now after advancing through Cutting Path, all insights became profoundly deeper.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that with a single thought, he could travel across the five domains of the continent, as long as he found the coordinates of that place in advance.</p><p>“Is this even possible?”</p><p>It felt too uncanny!</p><p>But if his thoughts were to rely on space, then with the laws embodied, reaching the Cutting Path’s ability to hide within the Way of Heavens becomes possible, extending his thoughts through the Space Order for thousands upon thousands of miles…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, located in the Central Region, could remotely observe the Eastern Sky Realm, Dongtianwang City in the Eastern Region!</p><p>Though all the scenery was too blurry, only some familiar essences, like Dong Ling and Shi Ti, stood out distinctly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
