Even if Elder Gu’s reaction time was extremely fast, and he realized it was an illusion, the control effect had already been achieved!</p><p>Elder Gu’s attack rhythm was broken.</p><p>From within a pile of disordered flesh, Xu Xiaoshou extended his right hand, reversed his grip on Hidden Bitter, and pulled towards the direction of the sword hilt.</p><p>The sword was so fast that it left afterimages in the void.</p><p>.com</p><p>The sword was so slow that everyone could clearly see the ripples of air caused by the shaking of the sword body as Hidden Bitter was slashed out.</p><p>Those ripples were still too slow, so slow…</p><p>So slow that even to move the hair on Lord Shou’s body required a very long process.</p><p>It was as if time itself had gone awry beneath the Ancient Sword Hidden Bitter, taking a long while to hitch up its pants and return in a respectable manner.</p><p>“…”</p><p>Elder Gu froze for a moment, his thoughts fixed for a moment, and it felt like a long time had passed within that moment.</p><p>Only then did he realize that he absolutely could not let Xu Xiaoshou form the sword power. His own sword attack wasn’t finished yet—how could he allow it to be broken?</p><p>“Autumn… harvest…”</p><p>But as the sounds exited his mouth, Elder Gu was shocked to find that they were too slow.</p><p>It wasn’t an illusion!</p><p>Time was truly slowing down!</p><p>Time attribute? No, the Fantasy Sword Technique, the Power of Time!</p><p>Shocked, Elder Wuyue from the Southern Region widened his eyes and looked up from the battle image originating from Hallmaster Dao’s hands.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>All at once in that battle, did he see my sword?</p><p>At the same time, a raspy low chuckle came from the Dao Imparting Mirror, irking people to the core:</p><p>“Time Sequence, Reversal.”</p><p>Swish!</p><p>The light shifted.</p><p>Hidden Bitter returned to the handle, retreating into the endless hair.</p><p>The imagery of Eternal Vitality, under Elder Gu’s widened old eyes, crazily faded.</p><p>The disgusting limbs and withered hair that had grown wildly on Xu Xiaoshou’s body, including the granular flesh that blocked his throat, all retracted!</p><p>Winter returned, and the sword formation was unified.</p><p>Mei Ziyu returned from the void, flying back to Elder Gu’s hand, but upon touching the palm…</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Elder Gu bellowed, his surging Sword Will immediately trying to shatter this “Time Sequence, Reversal” in an attempt to make amends.</p><p>But Hidden Bitter in Xu Xiaoshou’s hand took the opportunity to fly out!</p><p>Like Mei Ziyu had leapt out before, it transformed into eight major imagery in mid-air, accompanied by Xu Xiaoshou’s smiling voice as it descended to suppress his foe:</p><p>“Born in spring, grown in summer, harvested in autumn, stored in winter, when Yin arrives, Yang follows, the muddy well becomes clear.”</p><p>“My sword now surpasses the original, this is not self-praise. Elder Gu, you should be cautious.”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The eight swords coalesced into a giant octagonal well, trapping Elder Gu, who had never seen such a sword-breaking method, such sword cognition, in the deepest part of the formation.</p><p>This time, it wasn’t the Fantasy Sword Technique… Every ancient swordsman’s pupils shrank simultaneously. So, Xu Xiaoshou truly replicated the Planting Eight Swords?</p><p>“This can’t be possible!” Feng Zhongzui exclaimed, then suddenly thought of something and turned the Dao Imparting Mirror toward Mr. Siren.</p><p>Before he could speak, Mei Siren angrily turned his head, “Xiaoyu challenged him on his own terms. How could I pass on a sword that I don’t even know to Xu Xiaoshou beforehand?”</p><p>Really? How did you know what I was going to ask… Feng Zhongzui held back his words.</p><p>Seeing his expression, Mei Siren flipped open a folding fan with a ‘swish’:</p><p>“Yue Ran.”</p><p>What did that mean?</p><p>Feng Zhongzui was momentarily confused.</p><p>“Yue Ran” on this folding fan… Wait, Yue Ran folding fan? On paper?</p><p>Feng Zhongzui’s lips twitched and he fell into contemplation:</p><p>“Was my suspicion that obvious?”</p><p>It wasn’t just him who had suspicions. At that moment, Elder Gu also doubted whether Mr. Siren had leaked his own sword tactics to Xu Xiaoshou before the fight?</p><p>But he quickly came back to his senses. Just like he didn’t specialize in the Phantom Swords Technique, Mr. Siren’s proficiency in the Fantasy Sword Technique was equally disdainful.</p><p>He didn’t know how to integrate the Nine Emotions of Illusion into a single technique of the Planting Eight Swords, nor did he understand the Heavenly Phenomenon.</p><p>How could Xu Xiaoshou deduce the entire “spring growth summer nurture” sequence just from his half-performed sword move?</p><p>“What is life, and what is death?”</p><p>“What is Yin, and what is Yang?”</p><p>As he was pondering, that young man across from him actually started reciting these concepts thoroughly!</p><p>Elder Gu was amused and frustrated.</p><p>Could you really deduce autumn and winter from my spring and summer, piece together the four seasons, reverse engineer Yin and Yang, amalgamate them into chaos, and return to the original with a single strike?</p><p>“Surprised, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Conjecture, Passive Points, +4.”</p><p>“Surprised, Passive Points, +9999.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou never needed cognition.</p><p>After all, he had already attained it.</p><p>“Green spit for life, silent leaves for death…”</p><p>“Life and death, prosperity and decline, the Nine Times of Illusion…”</p><p>When the young man across from him uttered the words “prosperity and decline,” Elder Gu’s face turned pale and he almost lost his composure on the spot.</p><p>No, wait!</p><p>This kid wasn’t playing around—he was really onto something!</p><p>Entering the path with the time aspect of the Fantasy Sword Technique, using the order of the nine swords formation, and taking the life cycle of plants as the sword—this was the very origin of the Planting Eight Gates!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s ability to pronounce those two words…</p><p>How was this different from Hallmaster Dao revealing the Way of the Heavens’ energy movement?</p><p>“Born in spring, grown in summer, chaos emerges with evil!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, with an empty grip on the array eye Hidden Bitter, controlled the Planting Eight Swords that had become his own. He shifted the focus to the word “life.”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Endless devilish energy exploded from Elder Gu’s body, his flesh split rapidly, and soon he became extremely frail.</p><p>Not everyone has Eternal Vitality that can withstand the rapid drain of body, heart, and intention.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
