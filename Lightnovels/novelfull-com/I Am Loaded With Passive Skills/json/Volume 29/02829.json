Besides, that boy had many enemies!</p><p>What he wanted to say was actually that after being dragged down by Xu Xiaoshou, Li Fuyu quickly reacted, focusing all her Heavenly Abandon power on the Upanishad Formation of Xu Xiaoshou’s sword path—this understanding was also exquisitely on point.</p><p>As expected, once the divine path patterns within the Upanishad Formation dissolved, Xu Xiaoshou’s power dwindled…</p><p>But the words came to his lips, and changed to:</p><p>“She found Xu Xiaoshou’s loopholes.”</p><p>“By dissolving Xu Xiaoshou’s Sword Will, sword power, and comprehensions of the Way of the Sword, she weakened Wisdom is Emptiness, resulting in a stalemate.”</p><p>The same meaning, a different phrasing, and it’s not misleading the young… Mei Siren gave himself a score of seven.</p><p>Feng Zhongzui exclaimed in surprise, “Comprehensions of the Way of the Sword, even those can be exiled by Heavenly Abandon?”</p><p>Will and soul can be, why not experiences and comprehensions, though it’s difficult… Mei Siren nodded solemnly, and responded no more.</p><p>Difficult!</p><p>This was precisely why he rated her so highly.</p><p>To see Heavenly Abandon that could exile the power of another’s Upanishad, let alone come across it, he’d never even heard of it before.</p><p>Even the young Bazhun’an back then had never cultivated the Swordless Sword Technique to such a realm; seeing it today, he would have to exclaim “as boundless as the skies.”</p><p>But then again…</p><p>With such control power, how could Li Fuyu be foolish enough to throw out the Supreme White Day casually, letting Wisdom is Emptiness chop it up and deplete it?</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>A sudden realization struck his heart.</p><p>Mei Siren reacted!</p><p>…</p><p>“A trap?”</p><p>The Upanishad Formation of Wisdom is Emptiness was dissolving away.</p><p>The light of Supreme White Day was extinguished, losing all its brightness.</p><p>At the moment when this deadlock was ending, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly pulled back a few thoughts from his frantic abandonment of self and realized:</p><p>“I could have severed her Supreme…”</p><p>“But if she forcibly ends this move before dying, returning to this realm first…”</p><p>“As long as she can withstand the backlash… my Wisdom is Emptiness would have been depleted, and the Way of the Sword Disc temporarily unusable, I would have nothing… but what if she could strike one more sword?”</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>At this thought, the sky darkened.</p><p>The Supreme White Day, disappeared on its own!</p><p>After the daylight vanished completely, the earth momentarily entered night.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>Above the high skies, a mouthful of soul blood suddenly sprayed out.</p><p>Then, the pale cyan translucent soul body of Li Fuyu appeared in the void.</p><p>She looked extremely weak, as if she was about to fall, like she had suffered a severe blow, her soul body even slightly cracked.</p><p>Yet her cold, indifferent eyes could still penetrate the Yin and Yang worlds, falling on the astonished face of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Damn it!</p><p>Guessed it…</p><p>“Buzz! Buzz!”</p><p>While Xu Xiaoshou realized something was wrong, he saw the soul body of Li Fuyu, having drained him, now had faint dark swords lit up in her eyes.</p><p>That pair of small swords gathered a cyan light at the brow…</p><p>Instantly, it turned blood red!</p><p>“With my soul blood, I summon the gates to Phantom City.”</p><p>“To descend to this mortal world, where humans and ghosts tread the same path.”</p><p>As her voice settled,</p><p>The mark of the Nine Heavens cracked behind Li Fuyu’s soul body.</p><p>Night tore open a corner, and a soul like mist floated out, swiftly forming a gate leading to the Nine Sereneties of h*ll!</p><p>Inside the gate, fierce ghosts shrieked.</p><p>To outsiders, it seemed like stepping into the Underworld.</p><p>“Woo…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
