On Abyss Island, he had seen this creature, which appeared cute but was actually an ice-type Demi-Saint level Ghost Beast!</p><p>For Lord Shou, it seemed a bit weak.</p><p>For him, Li Fugui, and indeed for the tens of millions of people in Jade Capital City, a single thought could determine life and death.</p><p>Second True Body glanced back at Li Fugui, placed both hands on the Xing Realm Master Seal he held, and said solemnly:</p><p>“It is acceptable.”</p><p>“In the Apricot Realm, seeing the seal is as good as seeing me.”</p><p>“And Elder Han, is the imperial sword I have bestowed upon you!”</p><p>Li Fugui’s lips trembled, and tears of emotion immediately spilled from his eyes, “Yes…”</p><p>“Don’t be too absolute, I have important uses for people,” Second True Body finally instructed surreptitiously before disappearing.</p><p>The emotional face and welled-up tears of Li Fugui vanished in an instant.</p><p>He clutched the great seal, his face now solemn, and turned his head to look towards Jade Capital City, proclaiming loudly:</p><p>“Ladies and gentlemen, I have a few words to say.”</p><p>With the instigation of concerned parties, Jade Capital City immediately erupted in noise.</p><p>With a glance from Li Fugui, Elder Han transformed into a vast Frost Ferret, filling the realm with ghostly energy and resolute Holy Power.</p><p>“A Demi-Saint!”</p><p>“Ghost Beast? An ice-type Demi-Saint level Ghost Beast!”</p><p>“Lord Shou still had such a card up his sleeve? Why didn’t we see it during the previous chaotic battles?”</p><p>Suddenly, the entire city was overwhelmed with awe.</p><p>A Demi-Saint is a Demi-Saint. Except in extreme cases like Jiang Buyi encountering Mei Siren, most can kill with a mere gesture in the Higher Void.</p><p>Using the Frost Ferret to suppress Jade Capital City was neither overkill nor insufficient—it was a perfect fit!</p><p>“Ahem.”</p><p>All eyes turned towards him.</p><p>Empowered by the ferret and holding the great seal, Li Fugui’s voice resounded through the entire Apricot Realm, speaking earnestly:</p><p>“Firstly, I have some heartfelt words for the elders in white, the elders in red, and all who are loyal to the Holy Divine Palace in the city…”</p><p>The red and white-clothed elders were taken aback.</p><p>Oh, so it’s targeted at us?</p><p>Each of them immediately prepared their minds for battle, ready to face death.</p><p>Seeing this, Li Fugui chuckled, caressing his cherished great seal, his tone becoming colder:</p><p>“I will not kill you; I merely want to tell you a simple and brief truth.”</p><p>He rose high into the air, sketching something in the void under the gaze of thousands:</p><p>“Think about this…”</p><p>“Now, if you were to leave the Apricot Realm, and I am Dao Xuanji, well, would I dare to entrust you with responsibilities?”</p><p>With that statement, the city fell silent.</p><p>In everyone’s minds arose the image of Lord Shou, gesturing and spewing words extravagantly in public:</p><p>“Break at least two arms… break at least two arms…”</p><p>—At that time, everyone thought it was merely a joke, unrelated to themselves.</p><p>Funny, isn’t it?</p><p>It was funny! At that time, Lord Shou looked just like a clown seeking attention—a clown!</p><p>And the clown was none other than myself!</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>In an instant, Li Fugui could clearly see that the hearts of the majority of the people from the Holy Divine Palace were dead.</p><p>The rest either had their Dao hearts shattered or destabilized, and at the very least, were emotionally shaken.</p><p>Li Fugui smiled.</p><p>Lord Shou was ruthless!</p><p>The tumult he caused outside had firmly planted the image of a “worthless, brainless Dao Xuanji” and an “inept ruler Dao Xuanji” in people’s minds.</p><p>Even if Li Fugui knew that Hallmaster Xuanji was not so incompetent, he felt somewhat dismissive at the moment.</p><p>How much more so for those who had only recently encountered the title “Hallmaster Xuanji”?</p><p>Taken down!</p><p>I am not skilled in combat, but when it comes to managing people?</p><p>Ha, do you really think the title “Lord Li” was just for fun?</p><p>“Alright, men and women, young and old of Jade Capital City.”</p><p>“The Apricot Realm can be your second home or a prison, however you choose to see it.”</p><p>“Since you’re here anyway, you’ve all seen for yourselves what kind of person Lord Shou is; he’s actually quite endearing. Who knows, if you make some contributions, he might genuinely let you return to seek out Hallmaster Dao.”</p><p>“Since you’re idle anyway, our new home is a bit broken. Line up! One row for the Higher Void, one for the Cutting Path, one for the Sovereign Dao Realm…”</p><p>Li Fugui directly summoned the assistants organized by the “coachman” within the city, utilizing the power of the Frost Ferret and the Apricot Realm Master Seal to scatter the various factions and categorize them.</p><p>After consulting Lord Shou through the Apricot Realm jade talisman, they began fervent brainwashing in batches:</p><p>“Shout it out loud, our slogan is…”</p><p>“A happy home, everyone’s responsibility!”</p><p>“Beautiful Apricot Realm, it starts with me!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
