Hiss, now that you mention it, Lord Shou is indeed still in the Sovereign Dao Realm, but with this cultivating strength, he can defeat Hallmaster Xuanji and Sword Deity Bei… impressive indeed!”</p><p>“It’s not easy to handle.” Clearly, everyone could only chant six as ancient swordsmen, but when it came to spiritual cultivation, everyone was an expert in this field.</p><p>Some began analyzing Lord Shou on the spot, frowning and assuming an air of pointing out strategies from on high:</p><p>“Look at his Upanishad array diagram, though it’s said that only one is lit, the others are very illusory…”</p><p>“Only one?”</p><p>“Don’t interrupt, let me finish! That means although it’s so, that brightest one still represents a Upanishad. Even if it can’t compare with Water Ghost or Demi-saint Ye, Lord Shou is still awesome, right?”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“To comprehend Upanishads in the Sovereign Dao Realm and seek to perform the Cutting Path, how difficult is that? The more stable the foundational roots, the harder it is to cut! And I see that Lord Shou has a huge ambition; he probably wants to wait until the other Upanishad array diagrams are also lit before performing the cut, so…”</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“So I bet, Lord Shou this time will likely suppress his insights and not perform the Cutting Path, just grind it out in the Sovereign Dao Realm and wait till he figures out three to five more Upanishads before doing anything.”</p><p>“You shouldn’t have said that, you really shouldn’t!”</p><p>“Humph, makes sense, right? I’ve been a ‘Shou’ scholar for two and a half months!”</p><p>“Brother, your insight is profound, Lord Shou has always been ambitious… But let’s not discuss that, how is he suddenly about to break through?”</p><p>…</p><p>Indeed!</p><p>How is he about to break through?</p><p>It had been only a few months since he broke through to the Sovereign Dao Realm at the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion on Abyss Island… Above the original site of Jade Capital City, Xu Xiaoshou internally observed the dramatic changes in his energy reserve and suddenly realized the reason.</p><p>Fame!</p><p>But could fame also affect the spiritual stage?</p><p>“No, or rather, it should be said that it affects the sword-bearer. The advancement of the sword-bearer’s vitality and vigor, indirectly prompts the loosening of the spiritual stage.”</p><p>“Though I hadn’t been in the Sovereign stage for long, I also consumed a large amount of heavenly resources and earthly treasures, and had the Greedy the Cat Spirit contract feed me with nearly endless swallowing energy.”</p><p>“Moreover, the Sovereign stage isn’t focused on spiritual essence; it values insight more. Not to mention, I’ve reached the Upanishad level in my life attribute…”</p><p>When water flows, a channel is formed!</p><p>It’s just this simple reason.</p><p>Just as Elder Yu cultivated the water-type Upanishad and Ye Xiaotian cultivated the Spatial Upanishad, during their cultivation process, were they really clueless about other attributes?</p><p>No, it might be slightly touched upon.</p><p>But when the main attribute is complete, the comprehension of secondary attributes or other paths becomes less important.</p><p>Once the timing is ripe, Spiritual Cultivators naturally experience the rising tide of their energy reserve, welcoming the so-called “Cutting Path moment”!</p><p>“The firmer the foundational roots, the harder it is to cut the Path…”</p><p>“If the Cutting Path fails and the roots are damaged, the second attempt becomes even more challenging…”</p><p>“Once the Cutting Path is performed, the best opportunity for enlightenment in the Sovereign Realm will have passed, will I then only have one life Upanishad?”</p><p>Some conventional beliefs rapidly surged forth, and in an instant, Xu Xiaoshou was plunged into hesitation.</p><p>To cut or not to cut?</p><p>This “Life Upanishad” point, the surge of “fame,” brought the Cutting Path moment too suddenly, he had no mental preparation at all!</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou soon came to terms, realizing he was obsessing over trivial details.</p><p>To others, indeed, the firmer the roots, the harder it is to cut, because they cultivate only one path.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, however, did not believe he couldn’t cut the Path!</p><p>As for the issue most concerned by the public – if cutting the Path would prevent further enlightenment in the Sovereign Realm…</p><p>“I freaking have the Field of Profound Dao and Profound Dao Seed!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tore through his confusion, deciding to daringly give it a try.</p><p>He had long doubted this; if one truly couldn’t achieve enlightenment after cutting the Path, then the path of spiritual cultivation was surely flawed.</p><p>Regarding this issue, Dao Qiongcang had discussed it, and his views were similar.</p><p>And it seems not only a few individuals thought this way, some were actually doing it!</p><p>Without reason, the figure of old man Sang flashed through Xu Xiaoshou’s mind. He recalled the last time they met in the Higher Void World and the thing that looked like an Upanishad array diagram under his feet as they parted…</p><p>This might be an illusion, but the Great Dao Diagram of Elemental Divine Envoy Zhong Yuanzi couldn’t possibly be a dream, right?</p><p>As a demi-saint, he could also continue to achieve enlightenment!</p><p>How could the Profound Dao Seed possibly not activate the Great Dao Disc after Cutting the Path?</p><p>“Since I’m here, then let it be.”</p><p>When the Cutting Path moment sought him out, missing it would mean a long wait, there was no reason not to breakthrough!</p><p>Just like the ethos of the ancient swordsmen, always advancing, never retreating.</p><p>So is the name, and so are the people!</p><p>“Then let it come!”</p><p>Under the gaze of tens of thousands, Xu Xiaoshou hesitated only for a few moments, then made his decision.</p><p>Stuck at this juncture, even if he was challenging the Holy Divine Palace outright, no person or demi-saint would dare to intervene.</p><p>Even Feng Tingchen realized something was amiss. The scene that followed might be even more worth recording than the battle of the Seven Sword Deities, and he instinctively angled the Dao Imparting Mirror towards Lord Shou and didn’t plan to switch it off.</p><p>If he turned it off…</p><p>Without even thinking, Feng Tingchen knew he would be pointed at by the people of the five regions in the future, and even the entire Feng family would be denounced vehemently.</p><p>“It’s coming, Lord Shou is about to perform the Cutting Path!”</p><p>“Look at his expression, he has already made his decision!”</p><p>Suddenly, an enthusiastic voice rang by his ear. This was a rather dramatic narration that Feng Tingchen had not been able to produce since acquiring the Dao Imparting Mirror. He turned his head and saw a sheepish Feng Zhongzui.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
