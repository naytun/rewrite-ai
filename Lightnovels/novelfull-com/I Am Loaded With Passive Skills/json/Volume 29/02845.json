Evil thoughts like rage, greed, and fear frequently emerged, eroding his rational self-thought and trying to seize control.</p><p>“Summer grows!”</p><p>As Gu Yu’s voice changed, the weather turned into scorching heat.</p><p>These chaotic emotions flourished like bacteria after the rain, reaching an extremity in an instant.</p><p>Within the sword formation, Xu Xiaoshou nearly transformed into a black-haired monster, his body erratically sprouting thin limbs and truncated arms, emanating all sorts of malevolent auras.</p><p>“Power of Life!”</p><p>A captivated Feng Zhongzui watched the arena without blinking.</p><p>Compared to the Emperor Sword Heavenly Unravel and the second stage, the Dao Imparting Mirror could analyze the details of the battle more precisely and transmit them.</p><p>He could naturally explain better:</p><p>“Elder Gu, emerging from and returning to the farm, crafted his Planting Eight Swords from this inspiration.”</p><p>“As the five grains nourish people, they can also obscure them. This sword uses the Nine Swords Formation to tilt the balance of power, elevating the importance of ‘life’ to the utmost, causing heart demons and strange visions to proliferate in the midst of the formation…”</p><p>“But the opponent is Lord Shou!” Feng Zhongzui now knew Lord Shou’s trump cards all too well and his tone shifted as he continued:</p><p>“His Heart Sword Technique is the Devil Sword Technique, and he also possesses the Life Upanishad. Could it be that regarding the ‘Power of Life,’ Lord Shou truly has nothing up his sleeve?”</p><p>“I believe, right now, he is doing just as he did when battling Sword Deity Bei and Liu the Sword Immortal – using his formidable body to comprehend Elder Gu’s sword!”</p><p>“So the question arises, how long does Lord Shou need to understand the Planting Eight Swords Technique?”</p><p>It must be said, these words were really disheartening.</p><p>Elder Gu, acclaimed as the Number One Sword Deity, crafted a primary sword capable of inducing heart demons and causing grotesque mutations – something exceedingly difficult to resolve.</p><p>Even if he had only given it a shot, its tricky attributes alone could make many future challengers think twice.</p><p>But at this moment, as Feng Zhongzui spoke out, no one felt there was anything unreasonable about it.</p><p>No help for it, Lord Shou’s previous two battles had raised expectations of him far too high!</p><p>He appeared, omnipotent!</p><p>“How long will he be trapped?”</p><p>Gu Yu himself didn’t even have a precise grip on Xu Xiaoshou who had gleaned some insight.</p><p>But he thought, given the strength the lad had shown before, even if there was some insight, using this sword to trap him for a moment or two shouldn’t be a problem.</p><p>Of course, that would only be the case if the sword was understood normally, not if the sword was forcibly shattered.</p><p>Who could have imagined, just as the thought passed, after the probing “spring birth, summer growth,” the power within the sword formation merely paused…</p><p>The long-haired monster with many arms, Xu the Beast, without the slightest break, lifted his indistinct face and cackled hoarsely:</p><p>“Why stop now?”</p><p>Gu Yu’s pupils suddenly dilated.</p><p>Impossible?</p><p>Not even a hint that he was distressed?</p><p>This cannot be!!</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>What’s impossible?</p><p>The Information Bar had barely jumped when Xu Xiaoshou hadn’t even completely felt the entirety of the Planting Eight Gates sword before he was on the verge of deducing it entirely.</p><p>No help for it, the insights brought by the Way of the Sword Disc were too strong!</p><p>It seemed to encompass everything, even analyzing the essence of the ancient way of swordsmanship at the highest level!</p><p>If Sword Technique Expertise allowed Xu Xiaoshou to replicate the abilities of various second realm experts without understanding them, then, the Way of the Sword Disc at 80% proficiency was telling him what the most fundamental things comprising the second realm were.</p><p>Moreover, it posed the question whether these established conceptions could be discarded in favor of other ways of the sword, sword techniques, and swordsmanship that could be merged to refine the second realm, enhance the second realm, or even deduce the third realm?</p><p>The third realm was, of course, too far away, and at present, he could only glimpse its threshold.</p><p>To truly want…</p><p>One either has to take the time to calmly comprehend;</p><p>Or continue to risk assimilation with the Great Path to level up.</p><p>Even so, the 80% proficiency in the Way of the Sword Disc was more than enough, or rather, it was exceedingly beyond!</p><p>If the second realm could be deduced and dissected, then this Planting Eight Gates sword was nothing more than a combination of the foundational roots of the first realm and various basic applications of the Great Path.</p><p>If it was used to probe Xu Xiaoshou previously, that was acceptable.</p><p>But at this moment, with the Holy Emperor glaring down, allowing you to take the first shot, and you foolishly threw a “Fleeting White Clouds,” saying you want to test the waters…</p><p>More than just presumptuous?</p><p>This is literally courting death!</p><p>Regarding the mutation of “life,” Xu Xiaoshou could even utilize it in reverse—his Life Upanishad need not be deployed, for the insight was present. It wasn’t that he wanted to cheat, it was just that the opponent walked right into his strongest point!</p><p>The overgrown hair acted as limbs and circled around, Hidden Bitter soared from the void and emitted a “yelp”…</p><p>“Nine Swords Formation, Planting Eight Gates!”</p><p>Lord Shou’s voice, suddenly resounding at that spot, was sharp and stunning.</p><p>A shivering Feng Zhongzui stumbled back exclaiming, “This can’t be possible, Elder Gu hasn’t finished his sword move, and Lord Shou can replicate the Planting Eight Gates Technique?”</p><p>Gu Yu felt a chill as well, about to act.</p><p>But at the same time, the cunning old man spotted some flaws around him and burst out laughing in spite:</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
