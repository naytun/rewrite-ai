We haven’t done anything!”</p><p>“You want the God Fated Star, just take it, we don’t want to go into that Life Forest anymore, this white flame…”</p><p>“Well said, I indeed want the God Fated Star, therefore, transgressors will die.” Xu Xiaoshou interrupted indifferently, and upon seeing everyone fall silent, he continued,</p><p>“I will only give you ten Aura of time, just to ask one question.”</p><p>“Nian, who is it?”</p><p>This out-of-the-blue question, instantly baffled everyone.</p><p>“Nian?”</p><p>“What Nian? Penetrating Divine Senses?”</p><p>“Ugh, on the Ancestral God Ranking, there’s a person named Nian, indeed in this region, is Lord Shou looking for him?”</p><p>Of course, Xu Xiaoshou was looking for him.</p><p>This Nian, very clever, must have thought he could hide the God Fated Star using his skills and mingled near Zhou Tianshen.</p><p>Without surprises, he should have morphed into a member of the pursuing troop, hoping to reap benefits from the confusion.</p><p>Unfortunately, the location provided by the Ancestral God Ranking was vague, earlier even Zhou Tianshen himself couldn’t be pinpointed, he had to rely on the flow of the crowd for guidance.</p><p>Now, the Nian that can morph forms without a trace, was even harder to lock down.</p><p>The only certainty was…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked again at the Ancestral God Ranking, then focused back on that name.</p><p>Light from the sky scattered over several dozen miles.</p><p>Nian, is right here!</p><p>His main approach was a surprise attack, even if Hallmaster Dao himself came, he likely couldn’t prevent this move, not to mention a mere Nian?</p><p>“…Three.”</p><p>As he counted down to three, the crowd became anxious, yet still no one came forward.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled, “If no one steps forward to claim their identity, I’ll massacare everyone here, I don’t believe the God Fated Star would fall out of the Divine Relics with you.”</p><p>This statement made everyone panic.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Someone rapidly dashed through, attempting to flee this place along the Great Path, but just as they crossed the White Flame Boundary…</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou remotely pointed with the 10 Sections of the Finger Sword.</p><p>As sword cognition burst forth, the person turned into starlight, withering away, and was escorted out of the ruins.</p><p>“That should be your scapegoat, right? I can’t be bothered to interrogate… two.” Xu Xiaoshou continued counting.</p><p>“I am Nian!” Suddenly, a man looking about twenty-eight or twenty-nine years old stood out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pointed with his Finger Sword, and the starlight shattered again.</p><p>“If you can’t even withstand a single strike from me, how could you be the Dark Division Chief, how could you protect the God Fated Star for so long? One!” As Xu Xiaoshou’s voice settled, his eyes curved, “Alright, ladies and gentlemen, please die…”</p><p>“The God Fated Star!”</p><p>Suddenly, from somewhere to the right, there was a shout, “Whose God Fated Star has fallen?”</p><p>Everyone turned their gaze immediately.</p><p>That human-head-sized, radiantly multicolored, multifaceted Spirit Crystal quietly laid on the ground.</p><p>The Ancestral God’s opportunity was just within reach!</p><p>The supreme treasure, which everyone had been chasing fruitlessly for days, was right there in the moment!</p><p>Not a single person rushed forward, nor did anyone dare to pick up that gemstone and hold it in their palm.</p><p>“Received gaze, Passive Points, +5442.”</p><p>Amidst numerous resentful and cursing eyes, Xu Xiaoshou turned back, “Perception” retracing, yet he couldn’t detect who had thrown the God Fated Star just now?</p><p>He felt surprised.</p><p>What kind of trick was this, that even he was fooled, it could only be the “power of oblivion” that a Holy Emperor could possess, right?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t believe in the supernatural, and as he made a gesture in front of him, he was about to use Space Retrospection…</p><p>Spatial Upanishad.</p><p>Seeing is believing.</p><p>His action suddenly halted, the spatial mirror image forming halfway also disappeared following his pause.</p><p>“Nevermind.”</p><p>If others are willing to drop everything and just escape, why be so ruthless?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled. Stepping into the sky, he appeared beside the God Fated Star, his spiritual source drawing it closer:</p><p>“Go back, or send someone back to tell Ai Cangsheng…”</p><p>“This is ‘one’.”</p><p>He grasped the human-head-sized crystal gemstone, lifted it to his chest, scrutinizing it closely, and eventually smiled:</p><p>“One, signifies the beginning, it represents infinite possibilities.”</p><p>“Tell Ai Cangsheng, if he leaves the sacred mountain now, I will forgive his past sins… after all, to err is human, who can be free from fault?”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
