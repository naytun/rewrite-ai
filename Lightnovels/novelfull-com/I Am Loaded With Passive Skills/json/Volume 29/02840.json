The real point was…</p><p>“Damn it, so it’s really a 1% progress bar for ten Profound Dao Seeds?”</p><p>“I made progress with seven seeds just now, was it because I had some ‘excess’ comprehension upfront?”</p><p>It’s a bit expensive.</p><p>The variation of ten seeds thoroughly verified Xu Xiaoshou’s idea, making the Way of the Sword Disc even more quantifiable.</p><p>Between 20% to the desired 80%, there’s a gap of sixty million!</p><p>“Reckless!”</p><p>“Passive Points: 74747198.”</p><p>“Passive Points: 73747198.”</p><p>“Passive Points: 72747198.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Way of the Sword Disc (21%).”</p><p>“Way of the Sword Disc (22%).”</p><p>“Way of the Sword Disc (23%).”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Soon, the pain was cast aside, and Xu Xiaoshou immersed himself in the pleasure of Enlightenment.</p><p>In the presence of many ancient swordsmen, the Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation beneath his feet gradually grew brighter.</p><p>Li Fuyu’s eyes widened, filled with shock.</p><p>She hadn’t exaggerated before the fight; she really did have a basic understanding of all the Eight Great Sword Techniques other than the emotion sword technique.</p><p>Now, she could clearly see the divine path patterns on the Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation beneath Xu Xiaoshou’s feet advancing in unison!</p><p>“I only used the Heavenly Abandon and Fengdu Sword, how could he, except for the No Sword Arts and Phantom Swords Technique, have gains in each Path, even having insights into the most difficult emotion sword technique?”</p><p>“Is it because of the ‘Spiritual Sword Technique·Mountain and Sea’ he used just now, which allowed his Spirit Sword Way to break free from the shackles of the Path of the Ancient Swordsman?”</p><p>It wasn’t only Li Fuyu whose eyes shone.</p><p>Almost every one of the ancient swordsmen present had high discernment.</p><p>Even the younger generation like Lei Shuangxing and Feng Zhongzui had seen much of the world—their elders were that world.</p><p>Naturally, everyone could see that Xu Xiaoshou’s direction of Enlightenment was too mixed, too full, but the progress…</p><p>It was ridiculously fast!</p><p>“This is ‘a little progress’?” Gu Yu was flabbergasted.</p><p>After closing her eyes, Xu Xiaoshou seemed even more outrageous than Kui Leihan in the rumors, or he should be called a young version possessed by Bazhun’an!</p><p>Even Bazhun’an had to travel to various places in the past, observing landscapes and emotions, spending several years to achieve “instant success” when they desired.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou just fought two battles in Jade Capital City…</p><p>Granted, the quality of his opponents was also very high.</p><p>But not so absurdly high that his “a little progress” could capture so much!</p><p>“Such talent…”</p><p>Gu Yu recalled Hallmaster Xuanji’s plans within Saint Hall, suddenly feeling a tinge of irony.</p><p>What was Hallmaster Xuanji doing with a delaying tactic?</p><p>She was feeding a Taotie of the Ancient Sword Technique… no, a Body of Devour… no, an evolved version.</p><p>Whatever came his way, he’d eat it; whatever he learned, he’d use it, and even exceeded expectations!</p><p>If this kept up, by the time she fought Xu Xiaoshou again, wouldn’t he have reached the final-stage of the Sword Dao Upanishad?</p><p>Even if there were plans at the sacred mountain, waiting for someone or another, could they contend with this mature “Lord Shou” of the Sword Dao?</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Gu Yu, looking at the increasingly dazzling Power Upanishad Formation, suddenly came to her senses:</p><p>Do they still need to fight?</p><p>Why hasn’t Xu Xiaoshou finished his comprehension?</p><p>If this continues, the challenge would rot in her heart, not even daring to voice it out!</p><p>…</p><p>“Passive Points: 64747207.”</p><p>“Passive Points: 54747216.”</p><p>“Passive Points: 44747235.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Way of the Sword Disc (31%).”</p><p>“Way of the Sword Disc (41%).”</p><p>“Way of the Sword Disc (51%).”</p><p>“…”</p><p>When the Way of the Sword Disc unknowingly broke through the 50% mark, Xu Xiaoshou could clearly understand the Second World above Abyss Island described by Big Mouth Xiao.</p><p>He could even infer the basic foundational roots of Swordsmanship from that Second World.</p><p>His life…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
