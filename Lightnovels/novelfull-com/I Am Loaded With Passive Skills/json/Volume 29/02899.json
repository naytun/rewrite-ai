He surveyed his surroundings, and everywhere seemed pregnant…</p><p>“Damn!”</p><p>Zhou Tianshen was shocked, and he sprung up from the ground forcefully.</p><p>Being a big man, he couldn’t endure such a thing happening, and he ferociously slapped his own stomach.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>His hand hadn’t yet landed.</p><p>The little thing inside the belly wasn’t dead yet.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Zhou Tianshen suddenly glimpsed a face, familiar yet unfamiliar…</p><p>He thought his eyes were deceiving him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>No, Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t that handsome, that tall, and he didn’t have freckles on his face…</p><p>But that face was staring straight at him, and soon, the corners of the eyes and lips curled up, forcing out a cheap-looking smile.</p><p>The face might be fake.</p><p>But that smile was unmistakably genuine!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“You really are Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Zhou Tianshen was overjoyed, forgetting even about the child, and rushed forward to give a bear hug as if renewing an old acquaintance…</p><p>duang~</p><p>He bounced off his own big belly and fell onto the ground butt-first, his head buzzing.</p><p>“Yo!”</p><p>The smile on Xu Xiaoshou’s face was about to overflow as he bent down and poked Zhou Tianshen’s pregnant belly:</p><p>“Long time no see, and you’re pregnant?”</p><p>“Whose seed is it~”</p><p>“Um, I’m pregnant…” Zhou Tianshen’s face flushed red, and after stammering for a while, he couldn’t squeeze out a half-sentence, his speech completely disordered.</p><p>“Glared At, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression subtly changed, turning back and pointing, “I heard just now thousands of people were chasing you, saying if they caught you, they’d…”</p><p>Zhou Tianshen’s brows twisted, erupting like a volcano:</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, stop talking nonsense!”</p><p>“When did I ever say such a thing?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s lips curled up, just about to tease little Zhou again, when a cry of astonishment came from nearby:</p><p>“God Fated Star!”</p><p>This isn’t good… Zhou Tianshen, snapping to his senses, didn’t care anymore if the miscarriage might injure him, and he threw himself towards the Big Cloth Bag.</p><p>At the same time, those guys who had recovered from the shock of learning they were pregnant also noticed the light on the ground, all swooping down towards it.</p><p>“Scram!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s demeanor turned serious, Hidden Bitter flying swords shot out, with a minor use of Shock Path, aiming at that Big Cloth Bag.</p><p>Boom—</p><p>The gathering shadows were all blown away.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was about to step forward…</p><p>At that very instant, from a distant place.</p><p>Relying on sword cognition to sense, he detected that weird vitality breath had stopped fleeing and returned to its source.</p><p>“It’s here!”</p><p>Also, at this instant, without turning his head back, the Information Bar also snapped up a notification.</p><p>“Ambushed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>…</p><p>From afar, outside the Dark Forest, following the tail of the hunting legion, a cold shout echoed:</p><p>“Nian!”</p><p>In an instant, the sky and earth grew cold.</p><p>Before Xu Xiaoshou could turn his head, his Perception sensed a figure pouncing towards him from behind.</p><p>It was someone dressed as a man but actually female, with copper waxen skin, plain looks, and no memorable features—the kind of person one could easily forget at a glance.</p><p>Her eyes were too plain, or more accurately, as blank as a piece of paper.</p><p>She came seizing, holding a dagger that was slightly chilling with its gleam.</p><p>Unlike herself, the dagger was intertwined with gold and silver, its pattern natural, and exceedingly exquisite.</p><p>Before she even approached, its edge felt painfully sharp.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pores dilated, feeling as if being targeted by the Evil Sin Bow or being pointed at by the Shang Xuan Sword.</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>His battle consciousness was too strong.</p><p>Clearly, in that instant, numerous methods of resistance flashed through his mind, but it felt as if something had devoured those thoughts, making him forget to resist.</p><p>When he came to his senses again, the gold and silver intertwined dagger had already slashed across his throat, cutting the skin, piercing the trachea, nearly decapitating him!</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Finally, the dagger was repelled.</p><p>The bearer of the dagger seemed to grunt silently, then…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts stalled abruptly, failing to recall what this person did in the end, what they looked like, their gender, their age, or where they dashed off to after delivering that strike!</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>He covered his throat, his pupils dilated, disbelieving.</p><p>Everything was over in an instant.</p><p>To the outsiders, it appeared that Lord Shou had fired the sword, turned around, and his head nearly flew off, his throat gushing blood, drenching Zhou Tianshen’s face.</p><p>As for the assassin, no one retained any memory!</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0
