I was just shocked that you two played quite a flamboyant game. I thought my verbal apology was already quite generous, could it be that I should… kneel down?</p><p>“Enough!” Seeing something and aware of Ai Cangsheng’s misunderstanding, Dao Xuanji intervened.</p><p>With the younger generation watching, as the new Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace, and as the one who would request Ai Cangsheng’s assistance next…</p><p>It was only right that she should not let Ai Cangsheng carry on this way, or let others ridicule him, so she had to speak up:</p><p>“Like you, my time is precious, and I never joke around,” she said.</p><p>“The fact is, Dao Qiongcang has defected from the sacred mountain, and I am temporarily taking his place as Hallmaster.”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng frowned upon hearing this and extended his hand, but his gaze unvoluntarily drifted towards Elder Yu…</p><p>Elder Yu’s body shook like a sieve.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng pondered.</p><p>His gesture was clearly meant to stop Dao Xuanji from spouting nonsense, but soon he shook his head with a chuckle and slowly turned his extended hand upwards to reveal the palm of his hand:</p><p>“It’s fine, continue.”</p><p>Elder Yu scratched his head desperately, his face turning beet red, yet he did not utter a word.</p><p>Too amusing!</p><p>What a sight, too amusing!</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s lips twitched twice as she felt utterly lost for words, her voice growing weaker:</p><p>“I’m really not joking…”</p><p>“Ai Cangsheng, Dao Qiongcang not only defected from the sacred mountain but also took away Gou Wuyue and Wei Feng, and even released Greedy the Cat Spirit to attack Jade Capital City, forcing Elder Fang and Elder Zhong to descend from the mountain to protect the city.”</p><p>“At the same time, Xu Xiaoshou attacked with a group, claiming he would massacre the city before ascending the sacred mountain. Caught off guard with the sacred mountain understaffed, I had no choice but to order someone to the God Executioner’s ruins to summon you.”</p><p>Dao Xuanji was trying her best to focus on the main points.</p><p>She had not expected that upon bringing Ai Cangsheng out of the Ran Ming ruins, the first thing she’d have to do was to gain his trust.</p><p>What games were those two men playing in everyday life!</p><p>Is this what the world of men is like?</p><p>Even though her heart ached, Dao Xuanji’s thoughts were clear. She selectively skipped over some indescribably difficult matters, trying her best to state the facts about the enemy:</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou fought one against three, his combat strength already capable of holding off multiple demi-saints.”</p><p>“As for our people, either they’ve entered the God Executioner’s Ruins or were taken away by Dao Qiongcang, leaving Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe conveniently vacant.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou made a contract with the ghost beast Greedy the Cat Spirit, comprehending the Life Upanishad… ”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, borrowing blood on the Cutting Path, with the help of the Imitator and Ye Xiaotian, also comprehended the Spatial Upanishad… ”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou fought the Sword Deity thrice, and although the strategy of delaying tactics was successful, he also thereby comprehended many aspects of the second stage, suspected to have comprehended the Way of the Sword Upanishad too… ”</p><p>Dao Xuanji paused here herself, finding it laughable—as if she was really joking with Ai Cangsheng.</p><p>But everyone in the great hall could testify that this was no joke. After the pause, Dao Xuanji continued:</p><p>“Even Jade Capital City, in order to slow down Xu Xiaoshou’s ascent, they gave him…”</p><p>“Enough.” Ai Cangsheng didn’t want to hear anymore, for it was simply intolerable. These excuses and scripts were too shoddy, too clumsy, and downright preposterous.</p><p>“I’m not joking!” Dao Xuanji didn’t know how many times she had repeated this phrase. She knew what he was thinking, and pointed outside the hall, “You have the Eyes of the Great Path, just look for yourself, look down the mountain.”</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang.” Ai Cangsheng simply stared at her calmly, “I said enough.”</p><p>“This Hallmaster! Is not making a joke!” Dao Xuanji suddenly erupted, her face growing red, “Not at all!!!”</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, you should know, you’re not funny.”</p><p>“Ai Cangsheng! You just need to take a glance downslope first! Just take a look before you speak!”</p><p>“One, retract your Illusion Array and apologize; two, I’ll shoot an arrow at you, choose for yourself.”</p><p>“This Hallmaster doesn’t choose! You look first! Look!”</p><p>The whole Saint Hall seemed to be cracked by the shouting, with everyone feeling as if walking on thin ice, frightened and apprehensive.</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng pressed his lips together, turned his wheelchair, and looked outside the hall.</p><p>The Eyes of the Great Path opened at that moment, and he saw that the protective great array of Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe was fully activated, and down at the foot of the mountain lay Jade Capital City…</p><p>Suddenly, Ai Cangsheng’s eyes blinked.</p><p>The city of Jade Capital under the mountain was gone?</p><p>In its place were several Spiritual Cultivators, and Ancient Swordsmen.</p><p>Well, the headcount wasn’t bad.</p><p>Elder Fang had come down from the mountain and stood like a puppet enjoying the spectacle; Elder Zhong was also there watching…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was indeed there as well, with Mei Siren, Ye Xiaotian, and others like Feng Tingchen… Quite a lot of people.</p><p>Not important.</p><p>Not important at all.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng turned his wheelchair around and came back.</p><p>“Did you see?” Dao Xuanji’s eyes lit up slightly.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng calmly looked at her and shook his head wordlessly, “One, retract the Illusion Array and apologize; two, I’ll shoot an arrow at you, I’ll apologize.”</p><p>“But you saw it!” Dao Xuanji was on the verge of madness, “You, you, you… You clearly saw it all!”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“So, you saw Jade Capital City too!”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“No, what I mean is, Jade Capital…”</p><p>“So, I say, retract the Illusion Array, apologize to me.”</p><p>“Ai! Cangsheng! What I mean is! Jade Capital City was taken by Xu Xiaoshou! He has a world! He took Jade Capital City… just like that, he took it in, the Xuanji great array, the great array of the Jade Capital City, it couldn’t stop him!” Dao Xuanji pointed toward Beibei, her fingers opening like a flower, “A bet! A tactic to delay! Understand?!”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng took a deep breath and turned his head to grab the taller-than-man Evil Sin Bow from his waist.</p><p>“Ai Cangsheng! This Hallmaster isn’t joking, all this, it’s true!” Dao Xuanji rapidly backed away.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng stood the bow upright and drew the right arm back, the bowstring tight like a full moon, directly locking onto the head opposite:</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, I can also tell you seriously…”</p><p>“My patience has limits.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
