It’s huge!”</p><p>“Even Lord Shou couldn’t withstand the power of the Dark Forest, his belly has swollen too, hahaha, he deserves it!”</p><p>The Pursuing Army completely turned into a crowd of onlookers at a play, their faces flushed with excitement, the atmosphere even more intense than when they were chasing Zhou Tianshen.</p><p>The temptation of the God Fated Star was too deadly!</p><p>For it, Zhou Tianshen willingly faced danger and became pregnant.</p><p>For it, hundreds of people couldn’t stop themselves, becoming collectively pregnant.</p><p>Now for it, even the unstumbling Lord Shou has slipped, has been made pregnant!</p><p>Who is Lord Shou?</p><p>He is none other than the Boss of the dark factions, whom even the Sword Saint Rao couldn’t defeat, Hallmaster Dao could only misstep, and Hallmaster Xuanji could only bitterly accept defeat double!</p><p>Even he couldn’t seize the God Fated Star.</p><p>Who then can block the power of this Dark Forest?</p><p>Contrastingly, the very root of the many sins that led numerous people to inflate — the God Fated Stars.</p><p>At this moment, they were stripped of their sackcloth garb, shyly and timidly exposed on the ground of the Dark Forest. Just steps away, they were releasing their alluring charm, while also seemingly signaling to the distant onlookers two words… Innocent.</p><p>“Hahahaha…”</p><p>Onlookers who were close by laughed wildly at Lord Shou’s swollen belly, while struggling with the difficult choice between preparation for pregnancy and seizing the opportunity.</p><p>Finally, everyone enviously looked towards those six calamitous stars, their teeth nearly softening from sourness, yet they could only give up, only manage to shout out helplessly, enviously:</p><p>“No one can have them, not even Lord Shou!”</p><p>“Let everything be destroyed, hahaha!”</p><p>Hum!</p><p>The laughter wasn’t over yet.</p><p>In front lay the Life Upanishad Array Diagram, suddenly pausing.</p><p>Lord Shou’s body shook, his belly deflated like a balloon losing air, quickly shrinking after reaching its limit.</p><p>At the same time, fresh red blood spilled from all the pores on his body and the seven orifices on his face…</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>“He, he aborted the child…”</p><p>This scene stunned all the onlookers.</p><p>Had Lord Shou awakened?</p><p>Among the many who stepped into the Dark Forest, he, as the only one, had resisted the strange power and successfully awakened to abort the child?</p><p>“Stunned, Passive Points +2445.”</p><p>“Respected, Passive Points +4686.”</p><p>Break it for me!</p><p>While the Information Bar was furiously updating, Xu Xiaoshou, his eyes nearly bursting, was no longer able to pay attention to these external matters.</p><p>At this moment, he was intently dealing with his own body…</p><p>Yes!</p><p>He was dealing with himself!</p><p>This Dark Forest, as it turned out, contained a life force of the same level as his, even stronger than 80% of his Life Dao Disc!</p><p>This strange power, as soon as he stepped in, invaded his body, simultaneously guiding the Life Dao Disc to whirl out on its own, and also planting a black seed in his energy sea…</p><p>“Are you also Elder Sang?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was scared out of his wits then.</p><p>He had traumas about being forcefully fed seeds, even if this time the object was a piece of Dark Forest.</p><p>But times were different now.</p><p>He was no longer a fish on the chopping block who couldn’t resist.</p><p>Once the dark life seed was planted, it seemed to sense that this body was different from others, full of endless vitality, and it immediately got excited.</p><p>Thus…</p><p>The seed plundered nutrients, sprouted, grew leaves, bloomed, and bore fruit, all nearly in an instant.</p><p>Inside Xu Xiaoshou’s energy sea, a baby’s head-shaped oval “thing” quickly grew – he couldn’t be sure what this thing was, after all, it had no intelligence, no spiritual intelligence, and even lacked a body.</p><p>He froze for a moment.</p><p>Not because he was controlled, but because he was shocked.</p><p>That overwhelming desire to reproduce, which could control Zhou Tianshen and others, simply couldn’t control the current Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He didn’t even need to “spiritually awaken”…</p><p>This strong desire, which didn’t even count as the force of the Holy Emperor’s guidance, was resisted by Xu Xiaoshou with his own resistance.</p><p>He focused on the baby’s head inside his Qi sea.</p><p>Rather than calling it a “child,” Xu Xiaoshou preferred to call it a “Dao Fruit.”</p><p>Because this thing was rich with the insights of all the great paths he commanded, there was fire, sword, space, life…</p><p>Even though it had just condensed, its level was not yet comparable to his Great Dao Disc.</p><p>Upon estimating, Xu Xiaoshou felt that the Dao Fruit possessed about 10% of the power of the Great Dao Disc.</p><p>But this thing had just been born, and it shouldn’t be consumable.</p><p>Because compared to the normal spiritual cultivation power it stealthily extracted and emulated, the fullness of the “Evil Power” stronger than its vital life force had polluted this Dao Fruit!</p><p>Even so…</p><p>“This is too exaggerated!”</p><p>Without a doubt, Xu Xiaoshou was scared.</p><p>What kind of thing, being higher than 80% of his own Life Dao Disc on the level of life, could in an instant invade his physique, exhaust all its power, and condense such about 10% of the Dao Fruit, also possessing a more strange “Evil Power” than the power of the evil god Ai Cangsheng?</p><p>And this, was just a beginning!</p><p>If this bizarre Dao Fruit were allowed to develop normally, could it possibly nurture another one of his “embryos,” possessing 80% of the Space Dao Disc, Life Dao Disc, Sword Way Disc etc.?</p><p>Who, who, who, if they ate it, while simultaneously going crazy, could become himself?</p><p>I am already strong enough!</p><p>A crazy version of me, how would that end?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thought process was already peculiar, and now considering such a possibility, he was utterly taken aback.</p><p>He didn’t want to do this experiment at all.</p><p>Or rather, if it had to be tested, it shouldn’t be by him; it should be by his second true body… His original self was too precious!</p><p>“Sizzle.”</p><p>Without any hesitation, with a flick of Qi Sea Sword Thought, he cut the Dao Fruit into two halves.</p><p>The Dao Fruit shaped like a baby’s head split apart, exploding into chaotic energy within the Qi sea, blasting his internal organs to pieces.</p><p>This seemed to be only an incidental…</p><p>The powerful vitality breath from the Dark Forest seemed to realize it had provoked an uncontrollable entity.</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
