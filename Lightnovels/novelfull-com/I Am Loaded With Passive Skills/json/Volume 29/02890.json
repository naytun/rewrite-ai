So that person also gave him a fruit…</p><p>Zhou Tianshen ate it, and, feeling dazed, a bit uncomfortable, yet somewhat relieved.</p><p>The next day when he woke up, he had broken through the Sovereign stage and had also mastered Holy Power.</p><p>From then on, using the God Fated Star for defense and energy replenishment and Holy Power for attacks, ninety percent of those chasing him in the army were no match for him!</p><p>Zhou Tianshen was very grateful to that feminine oriole.</p><p>He also noticed a special phenomenon: since that day, no “overqualified” opponents appeared in the assassination army.</p><p>There were no demi-saints.</p><p>No overly powerful experts from the higher void amounted to anything either.</p><p>He had once encountered a Master with just a broken iron sword who was so strong that he almost breached the God Fated Star’s defense, his attack power more outrageous than any ordinary higher void…</p><p>But after that day, such overqualified beings disappeared completely, and those chasing him became a disorganized rabble.</p><p>In truth, they were also strong.</p><p>How could experts of the higher void not be strong? Anyone in the assassination army was qualified enough to be considered a Chief Elder of the Blade Will Pishou Sect.</p><p>But Zhou Tianshen felt something was slightly amiss…</p><p>This was the Ran Ming Ruins, not the previous Tiansang Spirit Palace or Tiansang City.</p><p>If this was the intensity of the pursuit he faced, Zhou Tianshen would feel that he, the sect master of the Blade Will Pishou Sect, was shamefully played with.</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>Zhou Tianshen was not stupid. He knew something was wrong.</p><p>How could a Sovereign Dao Realm expert capable of founding a sect possibly be a naive and simple little bunny?</p><p>The savvy Zhou Tianshen was aware that he had entered into a trickery-filled circle like being trapped in a ghost wall—if he kept running, it was a dead-end road.</p><p>Although he couldn’t figure out where the trickery lay or how he would eventually be killed, he knew it was time to “break the game”!</p><p>How to break it?</p><p>Without the Chief Elder around…</p><p>He could only rely on himself, the sect master.</p><p>Zhou Tianshen racked his brains and could only think of one difficult but necessary method to proceed:</p><p>Recklessness!</p><p>This was the Ran Ming Ruins, the Divine Relics, with many forbidden grounds that one must not trespass, some of which even that scheming feminine oriole wouldn’t dare to enter unchecked.</p><p>Having been chased for so many days, Zhou Tianshen had also run all over the place and was somewhat of an experienced old relic hunter.</p><p>He knew of a strange place where people became very curious, very strange when they got near…</p><p>He had passed by before and didn’t dare to intrude.</p><p>Now, he thought, he’d reached what the wise and peerless Chief Elder mentioned as the “time to act without choice.”</p><p>“I’ve arrived…”</p><p>Grasping the Big Cloth Bag, he came to a sudden stop.</p><p>Behind him, dust billowed to the skies as the assassination army also halted urgently.</p><p>Zhou Tianshen looked up, ahead lay a gloomy black forest with trees taller than the Heavenly Pillar, so wide not even ten men could embrace one.</p><p>If the Divine Relics were perpetually cloudy,</p><p>then the darkness of this black forest would need to be doubled; it was a black sky.</p><p>The forest’s perimeter had a stark demarcation of gray and black.</p><p>Inside that boundary, under the shade of gargantuan trees, there were many, very strange people…</p><p>Zhou Tianshen squinted his eyes.</p><p>He hadn’t paid much attention the last time and was scared away by the eerie atmosphere, but upon taking a closer look this time, he saw that these people were all incredibly fat and bloated, with huge bellies.</p><p>They were clearly people from the Shengshen Continent, dressed in its style, with cultivation levels that bore its hallmark, but they behaved entirely differently from everyone else.</p><p>Too leisurely!</p><p>Normal people entering the Ran Ming ruins should turn into the crazed pursuit squadron behind them.</p><p>This group of fat folks was strolling leisurely around the outer circle of the forest, each with a big belly, patting it and stroking it, their faces showing happy and content smiles, as if they were muttering to themselves.</p><p>Zhou Tianshen edged closer, not daring to cross into the gray-black boundary, trying to hear clearly what those people were saying.</p><p>Whispers reached his ears, and his eyes widened bit by bit.</p><p>“Baby good, baby naughty, baby’s kicks aren’t cute at all.” That was a man!</p><p>“Healthy and beautiful, may you grow up strong – little girl, you’re definitely going to be such a cute little one.” That was an old man, a male!</p><p>“Sleep, sleep, Brother Yun; I always knew you weren’t dead, never have been, I’ll certainly give birth to you!” That was a woman, but…</p><p>Zhou Tianshen just listened for a while and felt his entire world view cracking.</p><p>They were even more outrageous than Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>This damn place, how is it feeling even more terrifying than the effeminate yellow sparrow? Do I really want to go in…</p><p>“Zhou Tianshen, don’t go in there, it’s no good!”</p><p>Suddenly, a cry of alarm erupted from the pursuit squadron behind him.</p><p>Zhou Tianshen whirled around; he didn’t want to go in anymore. Better to die than to give birth to a child in the Ran Ming ruins.</p><p>How could the Blade Will Pishou Sect ever recruit disciples after this got out, especially after only managing to recruit two this year…</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>He turned around.</p><p>An axe flew at his head.</p><p>Zhou Tianshen was sent airborne on the spot.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>“The God Fated Star is mine, hahaha!”</p><p>The world went silent…</p><p>In the moment as he passed midair, there was stillness, and there was eternity.</p><p>Life’s highlight reel flashed through Zhou Tianshen’s mind, ending with his pupils dilating in horror.</p><p>To be sent flying was not scary.</p><p>Death was not scary.</p><p>But giving birth…</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>As the color on the ground shifted from gray to black, Zhou Tianshen felt a warm current shooting into his head.</p><p>Warm and cozy…</p><p>I’ve become strange…</p><p>Zhou Tianshen fell heavily under the shadow of the dark forest’s massive trees, his mind briefly blank, followed by a sharp pain in his abdomen.</p><p>“Ah.”</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>“Ah!!”</p><p>Zhou Tianshen’s face was flush with eagerness and panic, as he abruptly sat up, touching his belly.</p><p>His stomach was bulging out at an incredibly fast pace!</p><p>The abs burst through the clothes!</p><p>The abs disappeared!</p><p>“Ahhh—”</p><p>Shouting in terror, Zhou Tianshen’s expression eventually softened.</p><p>He bowed his head, gently stroking his swollen belly, and a smile of maternal bliss spread across his face. As he strolled, he murmured to himself:</p><p>“Xiaoshou, grow up quickly…”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
