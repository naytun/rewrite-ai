How could he possibly be delayed for too long by matters outside this battleground?</p><p>Suddenly regaining his focus, withdrawing from those perceptions that directly pointed to the source of the Great Path, Xu Xiaoshou felt he had returned to his “human” self.</p><p>What was the point of merging with the Great Path?</p><p>The secular world brought true happiness!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>After the Cutting Path stage, the first to aggressively approach him was not one of his own, but an inexplicably excited Zhong Yuanzi.</p><p>He grasped Xu Xiaoshou’s hand, his gaze fixated on his feet, blurting out, “The Diagram, that Great Path Diagram, I know… no, I don’t quite understand… I feel…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clasped the explosive-haired hand and said earnestly, “Elder Zhong, I know you like me a lot, but we are on opposing sides right now, and if you get too close, Dao Xuanji will sever your arm.”</p><p>Those words suddenly jolted everyone back to reality!</p><p>Yes, mesmerized by Xu Xiaoshou’s breakthrough, they had forgotten the main point—the ongoing battle between the Saint Servants and the Holy Divine Palace was still not over!</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi still wanted to say something.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou slightly shook his head, releasing his hand, “If you have any questions, save them for the First Pavilion in the Sky.”</p><p>He slightly moved his fingertips.</p><p>Without a ripple in heaven and earth or a wave in the Dao,</p><p>the space enveloped them, casting a frozen projection of Zhong Yuanzi and Xu Xiaoshou at the spot, while Xu Xiaoshou pulled Zhong Yuanzi into another simply constructed, unperceived extradimensional space.</p><p>It truly became one…</p><p>Realizing he could now easily create extradimensional spaces on a whim, Xu Xiaoshou was astounded by the power of Spatial Upanishad.</p><p>Knowing time was of the essence, he hurriedly stuffed something into Zhong Yuanzi’s palm.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>The spatial projection, spatial coverage, extradimensional space vanished.</p><p>None at the scene sensed anything amiss, except for the ancient swordsmen proficient in Fantasy Sword Technique and practicing Space-Time Transition, who noticed something.</p><p>But it was only a slight spatial fluctuation they perceived; what exactly happened was beyond their comprehension.</p><p>An overtly filthy transaction!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, after scanning the crowd’s reactions, suddenly got excited.</p><p>He could now even think about pulling down his pants in front of everyone and peeing… cough, what was he thinking? The second true body was indeed disgusting!</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi looked slightly stunned, lowering his head as he returned to Fang Wenxin’s side, his eyes complicated.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Fang Wenxin asked, frowning.</p><p>“Nothing…”</p><p>“Don’t get too close to him, he is after all a person of the Saint Servants!”</p><p>“I know…”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi of course knew everything, but when comparing his path-seeking heart with his position, which weighed more, which weighed less?</p><p>He clenched his fists, his fingertips gently caressing his palm.</p><p>As an Elemental Divine Envoy, Zhong Yuanzi possessed both space and blood attributes.</p><p>He could clearly sense that within the micro blood particles in the depths of his palm’s blood vessels, a small extradimensional space had been created.</p><p>Unnoticed by anyone.</p><p>Even if a demi-saint arrived, they would not know.</p><p>But within that space, a jade talisman was deposited, given by Xu Xiaoshou, supposedly leading to that “Apricot Realm”?</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi discreetly glanced at Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>If Hallmaster Dao was still around, he wouldn’t hesitate a bit; joining forces to capture Xu Xiaoshou and bringing him to the sacred mountain would be his first priority.</p><p>Why enter the First Pavilion in the Sky?</p><p>The Holy Divine Palace was a perfect place for research, and Hallmaster Dao would take care of the external trivial matters.</p><p>Now, Zhong Yuanzi found himself faced with a difficult choice:</p><p>“Apricot Realm…”</p><p>“Should I go take a look?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
