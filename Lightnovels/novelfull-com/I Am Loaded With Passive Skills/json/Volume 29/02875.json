Seeing that Lord Shou had no more questions and after waiting a while, he brought back the main topic,</p><p>“Lord Shou, while discussing so many people, what I really want to compare is Lord Cang Sheng, with heaven’s timing, geographical, and human harmony, it’s time for his ‘Heavenly Unravel’.”</p><p>“Now to engage him directly would be the most… erm, not a very wise choice. Anyway, my thoughts are limited, this is what I believe.”</p><p>He took a pause, raised his wine cup high, drank it all in one go, seemingly apologizing for the ambiguity of his earlier words, yet he continued with a solemn voice,</p><p>“Of course, Lord Shou has his own considerations.”</p><p>“But in my view, the best strategy now is not to attack the sacred mountain, but to enter the God Executioner’s Ruins.”</p><p>He veered off to another topic, speaking with a serious tone,</p><p>“All the major figures are gathering there!”</p><p>“Lord Cang Sheng bowing out early, losing the initiative, leaving only Yue Gongli as a variable for the Holy Divine Palace.”</p><p>“And us, we have The Divine, the Water Ghost, Cen Qiaofu, and Lord Bazhun’an forming the array from behind, moving as in chess, deliberating the universe.”</p><p>“You can first enter the ruins and together with The Divine Lord seize the fortune of the god slayer, and at the same time find Lord Sleeveless to discuss the strategy to escape from the Dead Sea.”</p><p>Li Fugui grew more excited as he spoke, eventually standing up, raising his wine cup towards the distant sky, and loudly said,</p><p>“Once fortune is upon you, and everything is ready, Lord Shou, as the new powerful god slayer, will return strong, lead the saints, ascend the sacred mountain, stir the Dragon Melting Realm within the Dead Sea, witness the Withering Snow of the West Wind at the mountain peak, how extraordinary will it be?”</p><p>“That Ai Gou’s bow, with no one able to wield it, and outnumbered, will be left with nothing but a whining dog’s bark, how can it stand against such divine might of Lord Shou!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
