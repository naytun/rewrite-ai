This time, it’s the God Executioner’s Ruins…”</p><p>“It’s hard to imagine, if he were to obtain the inheritance, what kind of face he would show. Will Lord Cang Sheng really, as he said, no longer be his match?”</p><p>“Hope not, hope not, Hallmaster Dao protect us!”</p><p>“Ah, Hallmaster Dao, please come back soon, I am not even free in my dreams now, they are all about that demon Xu Xiaoshou, last night I was just about to be scared into wetting myself, riding a horse when suddenly the horse’s face changed…”</p><p>The entire mountain sank into a mournful atmosphere.</p><p>Some even started cursing or praying.</p><p>In the Saint Hall above, the elders looked at each other, sighing at the combat strength Xu Xiaoshou had just shown.</p><p>Everyone knew, during his time in the Eighth Palace, Xu Xiaoshou, facing one arrow, was helpless and sacrificed Elder Sang.</p><p>The Xu Xiaoshou of the present, however, could single-handedly grasp the Arrow of Evil Sin Bow that once brought him endless fear!</p><p>“His progress, too great, too fast…”</p><p>Elder Yu exclaimed in amazement, his glance inadvertently fell upon the figure in the wheelchair ahead.</p><p>By the standards of Tong Ai Cangsheng, in this world, demi-saint level combat strength could roughly be divided into two types:</p><p>Those who could withstand an arrow.</p><p>And those who couldn’t withstand even one arrow.</p><p>The latter, of course, refers to those demi-saints like Dao Xuanji and Jiang Buyi, who had low battle consciousness, experience, and realm.</p><p>In the face of absolute power, they perhaps had a bit of brains, but that was almost equivalent to none, they needed strategies like those of Dao Qiongcang to eliminate the difference in combat strength.</p><p>Among the former, “those who could withstand an arrow,” it again split into “only withstand one arrow” and “more than one arrow”.</p><p>The former was almost the same as if they had not withstood it at all, it was just the difference between falling immediately and delaying the fall.</p><p>It was the latter…</p><p>That was the truly pinnacle combat strength on this continent!</p><p>Undoubtedly, Xu Xiaoshou had already reached this level.</p><p>Just when everyone always felt he was still lacking a bit, he crossed that threshold.</p><p>Growth, they say, is like water carving through stone.</p><p>If one were to observe it, it occurred in one fell swoop!</p><p>By the time you realize someone had grown, it was already unstoppable, irrevocable.</p><p>Especially…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t in the Berserk Giant or Ultimate Giant form when he blocked the Arrow of Evil Sin Bow, he did it in his human form.</p><p>That simple grab, imperceptible to outsiders, Elder Yu saw too much:</p><p>The power of the Dragon Ancestor, the Heavenly Ancestor’s Power, and the similarly formidable Engulfing Power, Power of the Penetrating Divine Senses…</p><p>Power of the ancestral source!</p><p>To have any of them would make one invincible under the heavens!</p><p>Apart from the God Devil Eyes, Elder Yu had for the first time seen two compatible powers of the ancestral source in a pure human body.</p><p>How could his body withstand it?</p><p>“Golden scales are not something of the pool, once they encounter the storm and clouds, they transform into a dragon…” said Elder Yu, his words laden with meaning.</p><p>What he thought of, how could Lord Ai not think of it?</p><p>The wheelchair turned, and this Lord Cang Sheng then turned his gaze towards the young and old in front of the ruins of the Saint Hall, a beckoning in his eyes, motioning Elder Yu to come behind him first.</p><p>“What’s the matter?”</p><p>Elder Yu did not understand but came behind Lord Ai’s wheelchair, thinking he might need a push.</p><p>This kid, so capable… Elder Yu genuinely leaned on the wheelchair’s back, not minding at all, and began to push and pull it back and forth as if idly toying with a fish.</p><p>Following Lord Ai’s sways, he looked toward the remaining few people with a deep voice:</p><p>“Time is critical, so I won’t waste words.”</p><p>“Dao Xuanji is neither courageous nor resourceful, with a title that does not suit his capabilities, only capable of ruining the Holy Divine Palace and the five domains.”</p><p>“Combined, all of you present are not even a match for Xu Xiaoshou, hence we need a new Acting Hallmaster.”</p><p>Everyone was stunned, Elder Fang, Elder Zhong, Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body, all were at a loss for words.</p><p>That was too direct!</p><p>You could at least beat around the bush a bit, soften it a few grades!</p><p>Elder Yu paused in pushing the wheelchair, and then he laughed.</p><p>So be it!</p><p>You kid still left me with a bit of dignity by calling me to the back before starting your lecture?</p><p>“Very well, I agree, Lord Ai Cang to be the Hallmaster is not unacceptable,” Elder Yu spoke first with a spring in his step.</p><p>The younger generation dared not speak.</p><p>The other demi-saints thought that what Lord Ai said was not wrong, eventually held back, and thought to raise their hands in agreement.</p><p>Lord Ai waved his sleeve, cutting them off, looking towards Zhong Yuanzi: “Elder Zhong, there’s a question I would like to ask you first.”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
