Dao Qiongcang paused, then asked further, “So what are you smiling about?”</p><p>A wrinkle formed in Bazhun’an’s eyes, as if he didn’t hear the sarcasm:</p><p>“I’m delighted that although his path is incomparable and his future uncertain, today, I finally see a semblance of it.”</p><p>…</p><p>At Feng Family City, on the First Viewing Platform.</p><p>Feng Xiaose, disguised as an ordinary spiritual swordsman, when he saw the image of “Spiritual Sword Technique·Mountain and Sea” presented in three dimensions by the Dao Imparting Mirror…</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>He could no longer restrain himself and cried out in shock, his eyes filled with bloodshot lines.</p><p>What he sought after…</p><p>What he had yearned for daily over dozens of years…</p><p>Even betraying the Feng family to join Xu Yue Grey Palace, just to get a bit closer to it…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou got it with just a close and open of his eyes?</p><p>Impossible!</p><p>Absolutely impossible!</p><p>“The spiritual sword technique is mine!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose roared in his mind, his eyes nearly spitting fire.</p><p>At this moment, he wished he could rush to the Central Region and strike that youngster dead with the Wrath of the Great Crimson God.</p><p>How could he be worthy?</p><p>He has paid nothing!</p><p>Wasn’t it just him standing there, and she threw herself into his arms?</p><p>“I cannot accept this, I cannot…!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose was on the verge of breaking down.</p><p>And since when did the spiritual sword technique take such form?</p><p>It should be as lovely as something that belongs in the heavens, appearing in the Second World with the most magnificent posture.</p><p>Not some ugly mixture of bits and bobs, hastily assembled into a giant spider, and daring to call it “Spiritual Sword Technique·Mountain and Sea Converge” as though a “ghost thing”!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I’ll kill you, ahhh!”</p><p>“You can’t do this to me, wuuu…”</p><p>…</p><p>In the Eighth Palace, before the Dao Imparting Mirror.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian stared blankly at Xiao Qixiu beside him, who unexpectedly entered an Enlightenment State.</p><p>He didn’t understand.</p><p>He didn’t understand how, when he hadn’t been around, Xiao Qixiu couldn’t grasp the Way even when listening to the Saint’s teachings, as dumb as a pig!</p><p>And now that he was here, was Old Xiao also reaching that state?</p><p>Oh, so there had to be someone to play the foil?</p><p>When all four were in the Spirit Palace, Elder Sang sneaked out to make achievements, leaving three, and only when I grasp the Upanishad to become sanctified, leaving Old Qiao and Old Xiao, then Old Qiao first, and just Old Xiao left…</p><p>I really shouldn’t have come!</p><p>He’s having his breakthrough too? He’s not about to become a saint all of a sudden, is he?</p><p>I’m a demi-saint of space, and I haven’t even had my moment of glory yet. Could you all not chase so eagerly?</p><p>This Xu Xiaoshou, this giant spider, what’s there to enlighten about, isn’t it just that?</p><p>But still…</p><p>Xiao Qixiu’s eyes burned with passion, almost as if they’d be drawn into the Dao Imparting Mirror, yet he restrained himself remarkably.</p><p>After waiting for a long while, Ye Xiaotian could only hear a surprised murmur:</p><p>“So it turns out, it can be done this way?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
