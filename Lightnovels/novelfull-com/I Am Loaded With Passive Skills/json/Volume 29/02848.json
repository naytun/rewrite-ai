He was utterly unapologetic, mixing mockery and teasing as he said:</p><p>“Old Gu is still formidable, having declared three strikes ahead of time, you’ve really whet my appetite, otherwise, the celebration at the First Pavilion in the Sky would have already begun.”</p><p>How arrogant!</p><p>The surrounding ancient swordsmen, spectators from the five regions, and even those in the Apricot Realm, all contributed a large amount of Passive Points.</p><p>Gu Yu’s eyelids twitched wildly, but maintaining excellent composure, he laughed heartily: “Rest assured, Xu Xiaoshou, I promised you would gain something, and I will not go back on my word.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wiped the blood off the Hidden Bitter Sword, not even looking up: “If it’s still that Planting Eight Gates Sword…”</p><p>His eyelids twitched, and his gaze stung like a sword:</p><p>“Forget it.”</p><p>Before anyone could react, there was a loud “boom” as though thunder struck from a clear sky, and in everyone’s minds, it felt as though they had been battered by thunder, leaving nothing but blankness.</p><p>Li Fuyu’s eyes showed surprise.</p><p>Cao Erzhu couldn’t help but step forward a half step, “This is…”</p><p>Through the Dao Imparting Mirror, the spectators from the five regions looked again, only to feel Lord Shou, who was wiping his sword and glancingup, had magnified countless times.</p><p>Behind him, where there was nothing, seemed as if a Raging Giant half-risen into the clouds, towering high into the sky, was so oppressive it left people gasping for breath.</p><p>In contrast, Gu Yu, against such a backdrop, seemed almost to fade into the dust.</p><p>“Force…”</p><p>Gu Qinger beside the Burial Sword Tomb’s Dao Imparting Mirror started in astonishment and then changed his words, “No, is it like Li Fuyu’s… cognition?”</p><p>“Did Brother Shou also develop an oppression-type Penetrating Divine Senses?” Near the battlefield, Cao Erzhu finally dared to acknowledge that familiar yet unfamiliar sense of pressure.</p><p>Father said, oppression-type divine senses are built on absolute confidence, even arrogance.</p><p>It could either be cultivated through numerous victorious battles steeped in blood, or by holding a high position over years…</p><p>In short, first, you must possess an “I alone am honored” aura, then have a basic divine senses foundation, to infuse even a single glance with intangible form creating mental oppression, even capable of attacks.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
