Only Lord Shou has the capacity to launch a counterattack while under control… Li Fuyu! Liu Sword Immortal! Can she react in time and block this second stage?”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui, gripping the Dao Imparting Mirror, shook it wildly in excitement.</p><p>That’s not right.</p><p>This thing shouldn’t be shaken.</p><p>The others are watching!</p><p>Feng Zhongzui quickly realized something was amiss, steadied his hand, but still roared: “The Sword Deity’s second battle, is it a battle of the second stage? This aura is so shaking that even my hands are unsteady!”</p><p>The spectators from the five regions, after experiencing a spasm of the frame, had no time to curse as they were once again drawn to the battle scene within the mirror.</p><p>But in the domain, the old site of Jade Capital City had already become a blizzard crisscrossing, drawing a boundary between reality and the spirit.</p><p>This “boundary” was invisible to the Spiritual Cultivators and ancient swordsmen who were near the outskirts of the Arena.</p><p>The Dao Imparting Mirror, however, had this feature, visualizing the Sword Will, analyzing everything, and allowing those watching the battle see more clearly.</p><p>Soon, as far as the eye could see, wherever the Fifty-four Sword Steps were densely packed, wherever the Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation covered, a boundless Imaginary Divine Country seemed to be forged.</p><p>Men were like ants!</p><p>Within this Imaginary Divine Country, the Traceless Sword Light that shuttled back and forth became a joke.</p><p>After all, how could a sword that strikes within a spirit kingdom, piercing within the spirit kingdom, possibly break the barriers of the spirit kingdom?</p><p>This was akin to encountering the God of Killing domain of Wei Feng at Ran Ming ruins with the World Taboo, the Hand of Confinement from Holy Emperor Fengtian.</p><p>One was manifested at the entrance of the ruins.</p><p>The other covered the entire Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>——They were not on the same level at all!</p><p>“They’ve stopped!”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui suddenly fixed his gaze, “The Fifty-four Sword Steps have stopped?”</p><p>Clearly, Li Fuyu also realized that Xu Xiaoshou was no easy opponent.</p><p>If she were to release the Wisdom is Emptiness sword, even if she reached the twenty or thirty kills, it would be of no avail…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou might be severely injured, but he was more than just an ancient swordsman, he was unlikely to die.</p><p>But anyone struck by Wisdom is Emptiness must die!</p><p>“Hum.”</p><p>The space in the Arena paused momentarily.</p><p>Then, atop the Power Upanishad Formation of Wisdom is Emptiness, another completely new Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation unfolded!</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>This time, without waiting for Feng Zhongzui to explain, the Five Domains Spectator broke into an uproar, knowing what this meant.</p><p>“The second stage!”</p><p>“Only an ancient swordsman of the second stage can bring out such a Power Upanishad Formation, indeed, Li Fuyu can also…”</p><p>“Lord Shou is Wisdom is Emptiness, what about her?”</p><p>“She said except for nothingness, Phantom Swords Technique, she won’t use others, so could it be the Swordless Sword Technique?”</p><p>Without waiting long, Feng Zhongzui glanced at the divine path patterns overlaying the Upanished Diagram of Wisdom is Emptiness, seemed to have an epiphany, and screamed:</p><p>“No Sword Arts!”</p><p>“Miss Li’s is the second stage of the No Sword Arts, Heaven… forsaken…”</p><p>Suddenly, the scene within the Dao Imparting Mirror remained, while all other sounds vanished.</p><p>Instead, it was the cold, chant-like singing voice that could spread in all directions within this situation, like the sounds of nature:</p><p>“Countless are the bright days, barren sprouts cease to thrive.”</p><p>“Garments return to original resolution and vanish, the Supreme abandons and leaves.”</p><p>Sizzle…</p><p>When the voice settled.</p><p>A round of daylight lit up in the center of the Arena.</p><p>The echoed sounds of dissolving mist appeared all around the divine country, as if discarded by the highest powers, exiled by the supreme.</p><p>The daylight was extremely small, its white light pure and flawless, suddenly enlarging, filling the entire heaven and earth, and instantly the power of Heavenly Abandon surged in all directions to the far reaches.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The scene transmitted through the Dao Imparting Mirror suddenly turned into a blinding light.</p><p>Many who were still immersed in the artistic conception of Heavenly Abandon were abruptly overwhelmed by the covert attack, with eyes tearing up, they stumbled backward, yet unwilling to accept it so easily, each opened their eyes facing the day.</p><p>Relying on the analytical feature of the Dao Imparting Mirror, the mirror soon weakened the intensity of the white light and faintly revealed a bit of the scene within the Arena.</p><p>Under the absolute white brilliance…</p><p>The blizzard dissolved like gas.</p><p>Space writhed as if evaporating.</p><p>Way of the Heavens collapsed, and then the various powers of the Way of the Sword pulled away by Lord Shou, were also abandoned and left.</p><p>“This?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was startled.</p><p>He had clearly drawn his sword already.</p><p>His Wisdom is Emptiness had come out even before Li Fuyu’s sword of Heavenly Abandon.</p><p>But as the sword came out, he realized his second stage seemed to be cut off at the root, unable to summon any power.</p><p>And that was not all!</p><p>Heavenly Abandon was not only dissolving his country of Wisdom is Emptiness, but it was also dissolving his whole strength.</p><p>The hand holding the sword cracked bit by bit…</p><p>The power of the Flame Python separated, and the sword body became blotchy inch by inch…</p><p>His clothes disintegrated with speed, flesh and blood weightless, starting to peel off and float upwards…</p><p>“Hum!”</p><p>The Flame Python shook mightily, conveying a lofty, exhilarated emotion of meeting a worthy opponent:</p><p>“Awake, Heavenly Unravel!”</p><p>A second request!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly came to his senses, realizing that his thoughts were dissolving bit by bit.</p><p>And this was not a spiritual influence, it was a direct stripping of spirit—not an attack, more like it accelerated “when a whale falls, life abounds” in the natural cycle, towards returning to the embrace of Way of the Heavens, returning to nature’s embrace.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
