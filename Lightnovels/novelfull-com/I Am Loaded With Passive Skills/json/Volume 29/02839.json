the Path of Transcendence is beyond reach.</p><p>“My Sword Technique Expertise at Holy Emperor Level 0, the progress on the Way of the Sword Disc is only 18%?”</p><p>In an instant, Xu Xiaoshou almost lost his composure.</p><p>He quickly calmed his emotions and seriously pondered over this serious issue.</p><p>“That’s right, it’s called ‘Sword Technique Expertise’, not ‘Way of the Sword Mastery’…”</p><p>Sword Technique Expertise provided him with an abundance of basic knowledge of Ancient Sword Technique.</p><p>Upon reaching the Holy Emperor Level 0, it also endowed him with a photographic memory, allowing him to replicate any of the second stage Ancient Sword Techniques he observed.</p><p>However, there was a flaw, neither big nor small, for which there was no solution.</p><p>He always had to have seen it first before he could use it!</p><p>“Wisdom is Emptiness, Second World, Heavenly Abandon, half of the Wrath of the Great Crimson God, Mountains and Seas Converge… this counts as halfway to the Emotionless Sword Technique, right?”</p><p>.com</p><p>All these were pieces of the second realm that he had once observed.</p><p>Among them, except for Wisdom is Emptiness, which could barely be described as ‘handy’, the others could only be crudely imitated.</p><p>It was actually a matter of insufficient mastery, but Xu Xiaoshou felt confident that he could still manage to muster it if he gritted his teeth.</p><p>He believed that he had already mastered four second-stage techniques.</p><p>But now, the Way of the Sword Disc was telling him that all of these together accounted for only “18%”.</p><p>“If it were called ‘Sword Skill Plate’, the progress should indeed be around ‘50%’, but it’s called ‘Way of the Sword Disc’…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought, perhaps this was the fundamental difference.</p><p>At the Innate and Master stages, ‘Sword Technique Expertise’ could indeed be used as ‘Way of the Sword Mastery’.</p><p>Because it was so vast, it encompassed everything.</p><p>Everything that could be seen at that level could be found answers for within ‘Sword Technique Expertise’.</p><p>But at the Sovereign and demi-saint levels, as the height increased and they moved beyond that well, they reached the realms of ‘Sword Deity’ and ‘Sword Saint’.</p><p>The difference between the two naturally became apparent.</p><p>“Sword Technique Expertise only includes ‘techniques’.”</p><p>“Nine Major Sword Techniques, Eighteen Sword Forms, 3000 Sword Styles, all can find their answers within it.”</p><p>“Even Li Fuyu’s Ancient Sword Steps, which is called ‘sword technique’, essentially is also a ‘technique’, and can find its solution within ‘Sword Technique Expertise’.”</p><p>“But what the ‘Way of the Sword Disc’ encompasses is more than ‘Sword Technique Expertise’, it should be comparable to the ‘Way of Spiritual Cultivation’?”</p><p>No…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickly dismissed this hypothesis.</p><p>Way of Spiritual Cultivation was too “miscellaneous,” capable of encompassing the five elements, light and darkness, Yin and Yang, and even the grand pathways of Spirit Sword Way!</p><p>The Way of the Sword Disc was not as vast.</p><p>If it were, his mastery progress wouldn’t be just “18%,” it would be less than “1.8%.”</p><p>Way of the Sword Disc should refer to the ‘Path of the Ancient Swordsman’.</p><p>Path of the Ancient Swordsman includes Nine Sword Techniques, Eighteen Sword Forms, 3000 Sword Styles, but it’s not just these; there are also lost sword techniques and sword skills, and perhaps also includes some specialized pathways researched by some extraordinarily talented swordsmen of the Ancient Swordsman Era.</p><p>Overall, from the perspective of Spiritual Cultivation, it should be divided into “Nine Great Upanishads.”</p><p>Practitioners of the Path of the Ancient Swordsman, roughly speaking, are equivalent to Spiritual Cultivators possessing the Nine Attributes who also aim to develop towards the Nine Great Upanishads.</p><p>Naturally, its threshold is higher, and its combat strength in the same stage, stronger.</p><p>And since human energy is limited, those who are self-aware should have made new choices after coming into contact with this information.</p><p>Like Mei Siren, who put aside the other eight “attributes,” utilized them as auxiliary, and specialized in the “heart” attribute, thus achieving the “Heart’s Upanishad” — Wisdom is Emptiness.</p><p>Feng Tingchen most likely specialized in the “ten thousand” attribute, Elder Wuyue definitely specialized in the “no” attribute.</p><p>Senior Rao Yaoyao is “emotion,” Sword Deity Hua is “ghost,” You Tu specializes in “illusion,” and perhaps also specialized in one or two other types, which enabled him to outshine the previous generation of Seven Sword Deities.</p><p>Hmm, seems like there’s another person?</p><p>That’s right, what attribute did Wen Ting specialize in… sss, truly a mysterious and tragic man, pressed into obscurity.</p><p>From this perspective, it’s not unreasonable that only the Eighth Sword Deity is honored in Holy Sword Land, while the ancient Burial Sword Tomb, Fringe Moon Immortal City, and even the Feng family, with its Sword Pagoda, do not receive the same respect.</p><p>Bazhun’an specialized in nine attributes!</p><p>The foremost person below the Sword God!</p><p>“Way of the Sword Disc, encompassing the Nine Great Upanishads, I have only made achievements in Wisdom is Emptiness, but haven’t fully mastered it, quantitatively it’s about 10%?”</p><p>“The rest barely touched the threshold, all added up begrudgingly makes up 8%, totaling 18%?”</p><p>Once one understands, all become clear.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou not only clarified the Path of the Ancient Swordsman but also understood the essence of this era.</p><p>No wonder it’s said, in the Spiritual Cultivation Era, the path of the ancient swordsman is not easy to tread.</p><p>Merely the Water Ghost Cultivation developing the Water-type Upanishad would be considered world-class talent.</p><p>But to compare it with someone skilled in the Ancient Sword Path…</p><p>He would need to produce another seven Spirit Divisions, a family of nine, united as one, to stand on equal footing with them.</p><p>Such a path, who could feasibly tread it?</p><p>For someone like Bazhun’an with extraordinary talent, how many could there be in thousands of generations?</p><p>Returning to the topic of the Way of the Sword Disc itself.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw the distinction between the “Great Path” and the “Lesser Path.”</p><p>Here, ‘great’ does not denote nobility, ‘lesser’ can indeed be interpreted as ‘refined’.</p><p>“If my assertion is correct, the Space Dao Disc, Life Dao Disc, etc., are regarded as single, specialized ‘Lesser Paths’.”</p><p>“While the Way of the Sword Disc, which is muddled and encompasses at least nine ‘attributes’, is considered a cumbersome ‘Great Path’.”</p><p>“Then…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at his Passive Points.</p><p>“Passive Points: 77347182.”</p><p>He suddenly realized that perhaps eight million passive points might not be enough to tackle this Way of the Sword Disc.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
