After losing his child, does he want to strike at the child’s father… no, mother… no, some kind of parent, is he planning to cut down this Life Forest?”</p><p>The spectators outside the grey and black boundary line watched as Lord Shou stared at nowhere, Hidden Bitter unsheathing a slash.</p><p>When the resplendent silver-white sword cognition flew past, countless green Mo Swords were generated behind it, roaring like a river and cleaving through the forest.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>This bizarre Life Forest, with trees so broad that ten people couldn’t encircle them, was forcibly torn open by a huge gap!</p><p>Wherever the sword cognition and Mo Swords passed, darkness withered, life was reduced—truly surpassing the intangible, damaging at the very essence.</p><p>“This sword…”</p><p>Everyone froze in place, staring dumbfounded as the grey and black boundary line was pushed inward, to the far end of the sword-cleaved forest, pushed for a full ten miles!</p><p>“Isn’t it?”</p><p>“This line, it can be pushed inward?”</p><p>After a brief silence, the scene became noisy all at once.</p><p>It is said that Lord Shou is proficient in multiple paths, but compared to the ultimate Ten High Nobles, it is said that he is slightly lacking in each.</p><p>Why doesn’t it seem that way now?</p><p>He slashed Sword Saint Rao at Yunlun Mountain Range, didn’t it say he needed the power of other Holy Emperors?</p><p>How come now, his proficiency with Mo Sword Technique is so effortless, his sword cognition so naturally perfect, and even the Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation…</p><p>“I don’t remember it being this bright, was it?”</p><p>“When Lord Shou was in Qilin Realm, I watched his battle with The Holy Emperor Qilin, and what followed…”</p><p>“Anyway, it wasn’t like this!”</p><p>Considering what someone previously said, that Lord Shou had already ascended to Jade Capital City, killed Hallmaster Xuanji, and fought with the Seven Sword Deities for several rounds…</p><p>Even someone went as far as to say that Lord Shou had already opened the Mystical Gate and possessed a demeanor of Godhood-sealing and Ancestor…</p><p>Could it all be true?</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points +5113.”</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points +1849.”</p><p>As the boundary line was pushed towards the Life Forest, people outside the Arena stepped back more than just one step.</p><p>Everyone looked at Xu Xiaoshou as if he was more frightening than the Dark Forest itself.</p><p>Not only could he resist giving birth.</p><p>He also scared away the “trickery” that forced others to give birth with a single sword strike?!</p><p>“Scared?”</p><p>This Xu Xiaoshou did not agree.</p><p>He withdrew his gaze from the far end of the Life Forest, casually wiped the blood crust from his face, and gave a cold snort.</p><p>This was scared away by himself!</p><p>The trickery was a coward, fleeing helter-skelter back to its origin once it realized he had the power to resist.</p><p>“Life force, Dao Infant, Evil Power, trees…”</p><p>Based on all of this, Xu Xiaoshou had speculated about the origins of this trickery, letting the bullet fly for a while by not pursuing it.</p><p>From his point of view…</p><p>If he looked through the perspective of Life Upanishad.</p><p>One could see that with a slash of the sword, life diagrams perched on the surrounding ancient trees receded like a tide.</p><p>Each tree was a hand, an eye.</p><p>The origin, naturally, was that which he had truly damaged with his Mo Sword, carrying a wisp of sword cognition vitality breath as it fled in panic, leading the way in reverse.</p><p>Once it’s frightened enough to find its roots…</p><p>Your boy will charge headlong!</p><p>“Dragon Apricot.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried calling out to the Dragon Apricot.</p><p>There was no response.</p><p>He actually faintly sensed the fluctuations of the Dragon Apricot and even the Apricot Realm, and in an instant, he could return to the Apricot Realm.</p><p>But…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also felt that.</p><p>If he did that, he would become the next Ai Cangsheng, never able to return to this Divine Relic, missing out on various opportunities.</p><p>With a grasp on Spatial Upanishad, Xu Xiaoshou’s understanding of the essence of space became clearer.</p><p>If the Apricot Realm is attached to the Shengshen Continent like a small circle adjoining a large outer circle.</p><p>The Divine Relics, though small in scale, run parallel to the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>There’s no intersection, except through the method of calling “Ran Ming” to enter, the remaining methods are likely only to overcome by becoming Ran Ming himself.</p><p>Unable to receive a response from the Dragon Apricot, and with no Li Fugui by his side, there was no one to give an answer to him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had his own brain; he guessed that this thing was probably one of the Nine Great Ancestral Trees, the Di Ying Holy Plant!</p><p>“It’s just…”</p><p>“Holy Plant, Holy Plant, is it so evil?”</p><p>“Maybe change the name to Di Ying Evil Plant, wouldn’t that be better? The word ‘Holy’ always seems to mock the Holy Divine Palace…”</p><p>With silent clicking of his tongue twice, Xu Xiaoshou sensed his sword cognition vitality breath hustling and fleeing far away, and soon withdrew his gaze.</p><p>He was Spatial Upanishad.</p><p>No matter how large the Dark Forest or how far the vitality breath fled.</p><p>As long as the mark was there, if one couldn’t take the easy way out, just take a few more steps.</p><p>Returning to the present.</p><p>After the dark boundary line retreated inward, the hundreds who remained caressing their bellies with a compassionate mother’s smile gradually came to their senses.</p><p>“Hmm~”</p><p>“What happened, damn, why is my stomach so big!”</p><p>“Darn it, there’s a baby’s head in my energy reserve, what is this thing?!”</p><p>“You, your mother, who did it, step out… what’s going on, dammit!”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
