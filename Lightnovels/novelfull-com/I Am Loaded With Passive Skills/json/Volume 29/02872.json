Boom! Boom! Boom!”</p><p>A series of sounds, as loud as thunder.</p><p>Even from such a distance, that destructive force seemed to be transmitted through the sound.</p><p>It sounded very familiar.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils slightly dilated, he had heard it…</p><p>“Lord has returned?”</p><p>Nearby, Zhong Yuanzi suddenly spoke, with an overly exaggerated startle and shock.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but turn his head away.</p><p>Fang Wenxin was also silent, her eyes slowly shifting.</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi, seeming to notice nothing, clapped his hands loudly to himself,</p><p>“That’s great!”</p><p>“Hallmaster Xuanji couldn’t move, Lord Nine Sacrifices needed to guard the mountain, and Elder Yu, this dead salted fish, refused to exert any effort… Lord Cang Sheng could preside over the overall situation though!”</p><p>“He is one of the Ten High Nobles, and among those ten, his combat strength had been preserved most perfectly!”</p><p>“He is one of the three emperors, the only remaining emperor, and he is the most suitable combat unit available!”</p><p>“He is also, is…”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi’s voice gradually weakened, his old face reddened slightly as he glanced at Fang Wenxin, then turned to look at Cao Erzhu, Mu Zixi, and Lei Shuangxing, among others.</p><p>“No, why are you all looking at me?” Zhong Yuanzi’s tone finally became a bit faltering.</p><p>Fang Wenxin’s lips twitched, “Continue!”</p><p>“Um.” Zhong Yuanzi couldn’t say anything further, his gaze swept over Xu Xiaoshou and his fist swung downward, “This is great, from extreme adversity comes great fortune…” his voice faded into silence.</p><p>“Received a reminder, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Received a reminder, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Received a reminder…”</p><p>The Information Bar dinged incessantly, Xu Xiaoshou’s heart beat incessantly as well, finally it had come!</p><p>Yet his expression remained normal as he swept past Elder Zhong, looking at Cao Erzhu, Mu Zixi, and others:</p><p>“Enter my Apricot Realm.”</p><p>Mu Zixi, however, shook her head.</p><p>She was now predominantly guided by Lei Xi’er’s will, her identity being one of the Yama, and previously she did not want to stay in the Apricot Realm anymore.</p><p>But due to her injuries, she had been taken in by Xu Xiaoshou again.</p><p>Now that she had regained consciousness, why should she crouch back there, waiting to be outpaced by the rapidly growing Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>“I must go.”</p><p>She left these words, pouted her lips regretfully, waved her hand, “Xu Xiaoshou, goodbye!” and resolutely turned to leave.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing nodded in acknowledgment, then turned and left.</p><p>Xuan Wuji turned and left.</p><p>Everyone had gone, including Fang Wenxin and Zhong Yuanzi, who hurriedly rushed towards Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked around him, only to find he was left with one person beside him.</p><p>“Brother Shou…”</p><p>Cao Erzhu scratched his head naively, his eyes smiling into slits, “I won’t leave, we are friends.”</p><p>The Ten High Nobles, ah!</p><p>You dare to make friends with me!</p><p>Oh, your old man too, then it’s okay… but, would Ai Cangsheng give face to your old man?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fell silent for a moment, “Enter my Apricot Realm.”</p><p>“What is the Apricot Realm?”</p><p>“Something delicious.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew Cao Erzhu was strong, but truly dared not let him take on arrows; he planned to deal with Ai Cangsheng personally for a while.</p><p>And the others…</p><p>Even Mu Zixi knew that staying would only become a burden, for the battle was against Ai Cangsheng, naturally it wasn’t one that could be won by numbers.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, of course, wouldn’t start the fight directly.</p><p>At this point, even if he stormed the sacred mountain and managed to cut down Ai Cangsheng, Elder Sang was not in the Dead Sea, but rather at the Ran Ming ruins.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had only one plan:</p><p>To pressure Yu Lingdi, defeat Hallmaster Xuanji, oppose the saints, defeat the Sword Deity, let the time drag on, until the Holy Divine Palace was frantic and Ai Cangsheng had to return.</p><p>Once he emerged from the ruins…</p><p>Heh, deciding when to enter and then planning shoulder to shoulder with Elder Sang was up to him.</p><p>Cao Erzhu shook his head though, accepting the Apricot Realm jade talisman, but he didn’t want to enter.</p><p>“I’ll support you from the back.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, seeing his steadfastness, no longer persuaded him and turned his thoughts elsewhere.</p><p>As Ai Cangsheng would return, including the strengths of Wen Ting and even the matter of the Ran Ming ruins, he himself had inquiries to make.</p><p>And the answers were most likely more accurate than anyone else could provide!</p><p>Inside the Apricot Realm, his second true body directly sought Li Fugui.</p><p>Meanwhile, outside, Xu Xiaoshou looked at the naive giant in front of him, thinking of comparing him to Kui Leihan who was almost on par with Ai Cangsheng, and asked without much hope:</p><p>“Erzhu, have you ever heard of ‘Lord Cang Sheng’?”</p><p>Unexpectedly, Cao Erzhu nodded, speaking with a resonant voice:</p><p>“I know, my old man said he’s ‘the strongest right now’!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
