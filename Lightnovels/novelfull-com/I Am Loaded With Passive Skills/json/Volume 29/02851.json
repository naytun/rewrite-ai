Advancing to attack, retreating to defend.”</p><p>“Elder Gu’s sword has combined three second-stage realms and Mei Ziyu’s Heavenly Unravel, elevating him to an inhuman level?”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui seemed to understand, yet not quite, and only when he received affirmation from Master Siren did his voice become completely emphatic:</p><p>“It is so indeed!”</p><p>“Previously there was the Planting Eight Swords that combined various first levels, now there’s the Unity Extreme Sword Technique from the Three Realms Unity.”</p><p>“With such a sword technique, how is Lord Shou supposed to break it? Can he really solve it?”</p><p>The Five Domains Spectators were still jokingly saying “Flying Cloud, Flying Cloud,” still ridiculing “how laughable, how laughable”…</p><p>Gu Yu’s talent was indeed laughable.</p><p>.com</p><p>But laughable as it may be, as soon as the light from the Triple Upanished Array Diagram flashed out, all of them fell silent.</p><p>Who needs talent?</p><p>Strength alone can slap faces!</p><p>And when Feng Zhongzui’s commentary confirmed everyone’s speculation, let’s not even talk about the spectators outside the Arena, even the ancient swordsmen around the battle area had their expressions turn incredibly grave.</p><p>“Three realms, able to be fused…”</p><p>Li Fuyu stared intently at that sword strike.</p><p>An old sword bone is an old sword bone after all. Her intuition before was completely correct; Gu Yu achieved what she could not.</p><p>Releasing a second realm sword technique was something most of the ancient swordsmen present could accomplish.</p><p>Even after finishing one, they could then release another second realm sword technique; a small number could do so—after all, it was just mastering two second-stage realms!</p><p>But to simultaneously display the force of the three great realms during Heavenly Unravel, and to have them meld together harmoniously, without causing a backlash…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had many array diagrams on him, and he had not been seen displaying three at once; he too had to arrange them one after another.</p><p>This was definitely something that only a veteran ancient swordsman could accomplish, and it would take a considerable amount of time to comprehend and deduce Ancient Sword Technique—a culmination of time’s accumulation.</p><p>Li Fuyu couldn’t help but take a glance at Mei Siren beside her, unable to be sure that he could accomplish it, seeing as he seemed to excel mainly in Heart Sword Technique.</p><p>Then, could his student Xu Xiaoshou break this sword strike?</p><p>“Pitter-patter…”</p><p>Mei Ziyu after Heavenly Unravel became like acid rain imbued with the force of time’s decay, the intermittent drops causing bone-piercing pain, making one riddled with holes.</p><p>But that’s for ordinary people.</p><p>Harnessing the robust recovery ability of his passive skills, Xu Xiaoshou could withstand Mei Ziyu after Heavenly Unravel, ignoring such damage.</p><p>Yes, the Heavenly Unravel of a second-grade spiritual sword completely lacked the power to hurt him.</p><p>But using it as a connection, the immense force combined after the integration of the three second-stage realms was terrifying!</p><p>When within the surrounding landscape, those nine great illusory swords suddenly united, in mid-air transformed into a Unity Extreme Sword seen only by its blade and nothing else…</p><p>Even for Xu Xiaoshou, his heartbeat couldn’t help but slow down for a moment.</p><p>“Influenced, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Intimidated, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Oppressed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>The Information Bar kept jumping wildly; the sword hadn’t even fallen yet, and its exposed edge felt like it was about to split one’s skull open, the pain unbearable.</p><p>“This, is the Nine Swords Technique…”</p><p>Faintly recalling Master Siren mentioning that the Nine Swords Technique had two main schools, one the sword formation, the other stacking injury.</p><p>The power of the sword formation goes without saying.</p><p>The path of stacking injury, the Answer of Infinite Number had provided the answer.</p><p>And the Unity Extreme Sword, on top of that, integrates all subsequent attachable injuries into the most extreme, most concise slash.</p><p>Just one sword!</p><p>Success or failure in this one strike!</p><p>One could say that, purely in terms of offensive power, the Unity Extreme Sword ranked as the highest among the Nine Major Sword Techniques.</p><p>And now…</p><p>Facing this one sword that united three realms, Xu Xiaoshou hardly had any time to think about how to break it; the Unity Extreme Sword from the horizon had already slashed down without any politeness.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The void changed color.</p><p>Before the greatsword could even properly launch, Xu Xiaoshou felt blood being splintered out of his forehead, the Information Bar jumping continuously:</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>And that was just the damage brought by the space alone!</p><p>“I must not meet it head-on!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately reached this conclusion, but soon discarded any notions of fleeing or dodging.</p><p>Because the Unity Extreme Sword was not just a Unity Extreme Sword, Gu Yu’s sword releasing both Flying Cloud Token and Second World at the same time had already sealed off his path of retreat!</p><p>“Then let’s fight!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dodge or retreat; his Hidden Bitter was slanted aloft, his chin lifted.</p><p>“Ten thousand.”</p><p>With just one word.</p><p>Beneath his feet, the Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation also sprang forth.</p><p>“Chi Chi Chi…”</p><p>The countless falling Mei Ziyu drops froze in that instant, then sprayed out as chilling silver sword cognition.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the whole world became densely filled with sword cognition!</p><p>“Ten Thousand Sword Technique?”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui cried out in surprise, “Does Lord Shou intend to counter the Unity Extreme Sword with the Ten Thousand Sword Technique?”</p><p>“But what’s up with this sword cognition?” he questioned incredulously, clutching his head.</p><p>Such a vast number of sword cognitions…</p><p>And utilizing the Witness Sword Technique, with the principle of All Things are Swords at work, instantaneously forming shapes on the spot…</p><p>One could say that with this approach alone, Lord Shou has evolved countless times more than he had before!</p><p>But looking at that Power Upanishad Formation, if he intends to respond with the Ten Thousand Sword Technique, where does his second realm stand in such a deployment?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
