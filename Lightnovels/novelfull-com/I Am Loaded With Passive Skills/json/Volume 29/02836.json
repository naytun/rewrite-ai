Are the Seven Sword Deities’ calibers really so high now? Casually using first level techniques, and squeezing in second level ones too?”</p><p>“I’ve told you, this batch is different from the past; each one of them is extremely fierce. Think about it, even Sword Deity Bei could use Emperor Sword Heavenly Unravel, which even Sword Saint Rao couldn’t achieve till his death!”</p><p>“It’s a pity, I think Li Fuyu didn’t lose. She just broke the rules she set for herself before the battle, but no one limited her to using only the Swordless Sword Technique and Phantom Swords Technique, after all, might is right!”</p><p>“Yes, but regarding Lord Shou, why do I feel it wasn’t purely the Ancient Sword Technique? He also sneakily used some methods of Spiritual Cultivation, and perhaps other crooked and unorthodox tricks, always felt like he’s a miscellaneous cultivator from the Southern Region…”</p><p>“Hmm, it’s hard to say, let’s see what the Feng family in the Southern Region has to say about it.”</p><p>.com</p><p>“I’m actually a bit interested in Lord Shou’s Sword Soaring Technique at the end. At that moment, with his back to the arena, I thought he was going to soar out from the mirror, never expected he’d charge at Li Fuyu…”</p><p>The Sword Deity battle, in the end, concluded with a Reverse Sword Subduing Technique.</p><p>Regarding this, the spectators from across the five regions had different opinions, and even those at the scene had a different experience.</p><p>Mu Zixi, in a daze, recalled the first time this so-called “Reverse Sword Subduing” technique made its debut—it was before she fought with him at Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>Who would have thought that, as time and circumstances changed, this sword technique could be used to end Li Fuyu and uphold the name of a Sword Deity?</p><p>“Seven Sword Deity Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>The young girl smacked her lips, feeling somewhat uncomfortable, as Xu Xiaoshou’s growth was too rapid, always giving her a premonition that she couldn’t catch up.</p><p>Indeed, Li Fuyu had her own self-imposed rules, not acting with full force; there were other swordsmanship techniques she hadn’t shown before she lost.</p><p>Wasn’t it the same for Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>This was merely a challenge set by an ancient swordsman, some took it more seriously than life and death, while others merely made a light touch.</p><p>If it were a battle to the death…</p><p>A fully unleashed Li Fuyu versus a fully unleashed Xu Xiaoshou, who would be stronger and who would be weaker?</p><p>In any case, Mu Zixi firmly stood on Xu Xiaoshou’s side, having the most blind trust in her Senior Brother.</p><p>“Concession accepted.”</p><p>In the Arena, as Mei Siren awkwardly withdrew, Xu Xiaoshou also collected his Hidden Bitter with a smile.</p><p>Enough.</p><p>He didn’t want to continue fighting.</p><p>This battle had taught him enough, enough for him to digest properly both internally and before the public eye.</p><p>Of course, for Li Fuyu of First Pavilion in the Sky, Xu Xiaoshou would give her all the respect she was due.</p><p>“Don’t return to Holy Divine Palace.”</p><p>“You are from First Pavilion in the Sky now, go and follow Master Siren, and then you can follow me.”</p><p>After speaking to Li Fuyu, Xu Xiaoshou turned to look behind him, at the Dao Imparting Mirror, at Feng Zhongzui and Feng Tingchen, then slowly opened his mouth again:</p><p>“Actually, to say I won… but if we’re talking about the proficiency in Ancient Sword Technique, I lost.”</p><p>“Miss Li held back more than once. At the very beginning, she could have used Innate Heavenly Abandon, followed by Fifty-four Sword Steps…”</p><p>“I’m sure by the time I realized what was happening, I wouldn’t even be able to make a single counterstrike and would have to break the rules to use other methods to protect myself.”</p><p>Li Fuyu, who had already let go, paused in her departing steps and her expression became complicated upon hearing this.</p><p>She indeed had the chance to win.</p><p>But at that time, her approach to wielding the sword was truly from a teaching perspective, never considering the possibility of losing.</p><p>However…</p><p>A loss is a loss. There was nothing more to explain.</p><p>Failing to take Xu Xiaoshou back to the sword tower this time doesn’t mean there’s no chance in the future.</p><p>Before Feng Zhongzui could start the interview, holding the Dao Imparting Mirror, he saw this humble side of Lord Shou and murmured with his head bowed:</p><p>“To be honest, I’m not quite used to Lord Shou being this… humble…”</p><p>This time after winning, Lord Shou didn’t become arrogant!</p><p>Not only did he reflect on the previous battle, but he even continued to criticize himself after reflecting:</p><p>“Senior Feng…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked sincerely at Feng Tingchen and said, “I take back the disrespectful words I said before. The ranking of the Sword Pagoda does have some basis, and solely in terms of Ancient Sword Path, I still have shortcomings.”</p><p>This made not only Feng Zhongzui and Feng Tingchen uncomfortable.</p><p>Everyone felt a chill down their spine, unaware of what Lord Shou was plotting, but they felt there were clues to follow.</p><p>He didn’t become arrogant, but instead he planted his roots even deeper. What was he trying to do? Feng Tingchen had a gut feeling that something wasn’t right. He grabbed back the Dao Imparting Mirror from Feng Zhongzui’s hand without asking about the spiritual sword technique that was planned, and said:</p><p>“Lord Shou is being too humble.”</p><p>“To win is to win, to lose is to lose.”</p><p>“Before the Seven Sword Deities make their ranking, if you two wish to battle again, just give my Feng family a shout anytime.”</p><p>After a pause, Feng Tingchen spoke smoothly and started moving quickly, “If there’s nothing else, we’ll be heading back to the Southern Region.”</p><p>He turned and glared at Feng Zhongzui: Run!</p><p>Unwanted courtesies are often signs of hidden agendas or deceit.</p><p>And now suddenly acting humble, even trying to ingratiate himself with the Sword Pagoda…</p><p>He wouldn’t have set his sights just on the Feng family, but now seeing how strong Li Fuyu is, he wouldn’t also have his eyes on the Sword Pagoda, rivaling the sword tower, would he?</p><p>Good grief!</p><p>This robber!</p><p>The city of Yu Lingdi was already moved by him, so if one day the Sword Pagoda suddenly vanished without a trace, it would be understandable…</p><p>With this thought, Feng Tingchen didn’t want to stay in this ominous place for a moment longer.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
