I’m heading over to impart the Dao to you now!”</p><p>The crowd around the Dao Imparting Mirror immediately boiled over.</p><p>“Okay!”</p><p>“Flower Moon Tower, got it. As long as you dare to impart, I dare to host.”</p><p>“How much is a meal worth of Spirit Crystals? Brothers, charge! Let’s keep this kid soaked in wine his whole life, pickle him into a wine man.”</p><p>“Hahaha, a wine man? More like an Alcohol Sword Immortal! Sounds more elegant, and I see potential in him as a swordsman…”</p><p>Unconsciously, Feng Tingchen wanted to turn around and drag that suicide-seeking kid back home.</p><p>Suddenly, he stopped in his tracks.</p><p>Was there not any truth to what Feng Zhongzui said?</p><p>The ancient swordsmen who had never witnessed the battle between Sword Deity Hua and Bazhun’an, didn’t they feel regret too?</p><p>As long as he was not present, as long as the Feng family elder wasn’t there…</p><p>Feng Zhongzui admitted it was his own caprice. When it came down to it, wasn’t it just child’s mischief? Was there any consequence?</p><p>No!</p><p>Wasn’t the purpose of the Dao Imparting Mirror to allow the world to watch battles and attain Dao?</p><p>Correct!</p><p>So, should Feng Zhongzui’s actions be stopped?</p><p>No!</p><p>Feng Tingchen wiped his face, changed his appearance, leaped onto the treetops, and looked towards the distant Dao Imparting Mirror with a smile on his face.</p><p>“Worthy of being a Feng family boy, gutsy!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Ai Cangsheng!!!”</p><p>Thunderous sounds rolled from the sky, echoing around Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, shocking and startling the world:</p><p>“In the battle within the Eighth Palace that day, I was at the Innate stage, and you a demi-saint. Despite the vast distance and the difference between our stages, you dared to shoot me with the Arrow of the Evil Sin Bow, causing my master, Sang Qiye, to be struck by an arrow, deviate during cultivation, and be taken to your sacred mountain.”</p><p>“Good! A majestic demi-saint covertly attacking an Innate—aside from where your cultivated virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor are, I only ask you…”</p><p>“Did you ever think that in less than a year, I, the young master, would return with the Upanishad, step on the sacred mountain, and shatter your damn turtle shell array with one hand?”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a giant was born!</p><p>In the brilliance of the golden light, the Berserk Giant’s hands turned charred and withered, then visualized into red-gold dragon scales, and with one explosive palm, it struck down!</p><p>“Boom!!!”</p><p>There was not a trace of Weaving Expertise’s art.</p><p>Purely an aesthetic of violence.</p><p>With the loss of the Saint Stage Divine Sorcerer’s manipulation, the guardianships of the mountain guardians perished, and in the eyes of another Saint Stage Divine Sorcerer, flaws were everywhere!</p><p>This palm strike broke open a sky hole in the great array!</p><p>Inside the Apricot Realm, every person from Jade Capital City who saw this scene was dumbfounded.</p><p>They remember that day when even activating the Divine, Human Realm Dao, and Way of Asura—a total of three ancient martial arts techniques—and a God-Level Shattering Fist barely caught a gap before the great array of the Saint Mountain was activated.</p><p>In the end, it didn’t even damage the array, and all kinds of powers were erased by The Divine.</p><p>But now…</p><p>Lord Shou ascended the mountain!</p><p>The shackles of Jade Capital City were first removed by him.</p><p>The Dao Xuanji who could manipulate the great array of the Saint Mountain was cut down by him into two parts.</p><p>There’s only the Ninth Divine Priest who’s not adept at fighting, and Ai Cangsheng, who can only sit in his wheelchair and stare…</p><p>Really, could anyone still stop this madman’s advance?</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>In front of the Dao Imparting Mirror, when they saw Lord Shou shatter the protective array of Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe with one punch, the spectating crowd exploded completely.</p><p>They didn’t understand all the intricacies inside.</p><p>All they knew was that the holy land of the Spiritual Cultivators had been broken by a punch from Lord Shou, creating a gaping hole.</p><p>This was more impactful than the unseen “At the Gates of Hell, even The Divine is revered,” more thrilling than the legendary “Hua Ba Great Battle!”</p><p>“This fellow…”</p><p>At the Saint Hall ruins, Elder Yu unconsciously frowned and stepped half a step forward, as if he couldn’t stand it anymore.</p><p>He suddenly realized that there was no one around who needed his act.</p><p>Dao Xuanji is dead.</p><p>The judges have rolled away.</p><p>This was time to slack off, not a time to stand out.</p><p>“…Be careful, Ai Shengsheng, you’re fierce,” Elder Yu warned as he stepped forward, then backed away.</p><p>Lord Shou gazed into the sky at the Golden Giant, his expression undisturbed, not even retorting or raising his bow to silence anyone.</p><p>“Mute?”</p><p>“Nothing left to say?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was indeed shameless, and the idea of “Saints must not be insulted” didn’t exist in his dictionary. When it was time to insult, he would relentlessly stomp it into the ground.</p><p>“Good! I have another question for Emperor Lord Shou!”</p><p>“The great Holy Divine Palace, constantly proclaiming itself as the army of justice, has set the rules of the continent that humans must not associate with Ghost Beasts, and those above Sovereign rank must establish a bounded domain to take action.”</p><p>“Yet, internally, they indulge Ghost Beasts, harm the Red Coats, and externally, they go back on their own words, bullying the weak…”</p><p>“I would like to ask Elder Fang Wenxin, the first-generation Red Coat, if there are any errors in what I said? Dare you place your hand on your heart and ask yourself if “I, Xu Xiaoshou, speak with my eyes open”?</p><p>Above and below the mountain, countless gazes were cast towards the seen and unseen, Fang Wenxin.</p><p>Fang Wenxin, at the ruins of the Saint Hall, sighed deeply, unable to reply.</p><p>“Silence is correct!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou then looked back at Lord Shou and asked, “I ask Emperor Lord Shou again about so-called ‘Great Love for the People’ — what truly is fairness, and what is partiality?”</p><p>The young people on the mountain were somewhat confused, while the old folks felt a chill in their scalps.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth was terrifying, pinpointing the heart of all issues with lethal precision.</p><p>Lord Shou pushed his wheelchair forward, not speaking, and slowly raised the Evil Sin Bow.</p><p>“Hum!”</p><p>The power of the evil god gathered.</p><p>A black and red arrow from the Evil Sin Bow rapidly formed on the bow, causing the surrounding space to tremble layer by layer.</p><p>“Target locked, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed instead of being alarmed, laughing out loud:</p><p>“Truly in the style of the Holy Divine Palace, if you can’t solve the problem, then eliminate the person raising the problem!”</p><p>“What a Holy Divine Palace!”</p><p>“What a Lord Shou!”</p><p>“Good…”</p><p>Boom!!!</p><p>The screen on the Dao Imparting Mirror zoomed in abruptly, moving from the base of the mountain to the peak, yet in that same moment, the image of the arrow from the Evil Sin Bow was lost.</p><p>No one could keep up with Lord Shou’s Evil Sin Bow!</p><p>From the release of the string, to striking the target, to death, it didn’t even take half a breath!</p><p>This fact had already been physically verified by everyone in the Saint Hall.</p><p>But this time!</p><p>Beibei, Xi, and others saw for the first time what the words “Ancient Swordsman” meant and how they restricted Lord Shou!</p><p>“Awooo—”</p><p>Upon the startling release of the Evil Sin Bow, a dragon’s roar followed, and a red-gold dragon shadow appeared in the sky.</p><p>In just a moment, the dragon shadow vanished as if it were an illusion.</p><p>All that people saw, and what was transmitted through the Dao Imparting Mirror, was on the other side…</p><p>Lord Shou!</p><p>The human form of Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>With one hand, he had grasped the arrow of the Evil Sin Bow!</p><p>His robe was already gone, his scorched hand covered with red-gold dragon scales; the arrow trembled and vibrated in his hand as if alive, unwilling to be restrained.</p><p>But the full force of the evil god’s power gradually dissipated with time, and the Arrow of Evil Sin Bow ultimately vanished into nothing.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression was serene; he slowly lowered his arm and then said with a light chuckle:</p><p>“As an Innate, you only covertly attack.”</p><p>“As a Sovereign, you also only covertly attack.”</p><p>“Lord Shou, you seem to understand very well how to bully the weak? Rest assured, I didn’t come here to fight you this time.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stood proud at the top of the sacred mountain, even within the great protective array.</p><p>He looked around, his voice cold as he declared:</p><p>“I came to inform you.”</p><p>“The initiative at the God Executioner’s Ruins, once lost by you, will never allow you to catch up with others.”</p><p>“I have now climbed the sacred mountain, use all your means, weave an inescapable net; when I return, I hope, ‘bullying the weak’ will still be possible for you!”</p><p>Hum!</p><p>The Arrow of Evil Sin Bow abruptly gathered again.</p><p>Lord Shou seemed to understand what Xu Xiaoshou was about to do.</p><p>But at the same moment, divine light descended from heaven, enveloping Xu Xiaoshou, and he disappeared.</p><p>“God’s Fate, all beings are equal… Ran Ming!”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>1 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p><p>1</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
