in the Second World, it weakens the opponent, and even before weakening, it steals the power; when the person is at their wits’ end, the Unity Extreme Sword that has accumulated full power finally slashes down!”</p><p>“Thus, even if the Holy Emperor were to come, truly meant to be dragged down and exhausted to the limit, he might also be chopped into being severely injured!”</p><p>Gu Yu’s objective, perhaps at this moment among the watchers who could quickly see through it, would not exceed the number of a single slap.</p><p>Yet Xu Xiaoshou glimpsed the truth during this chaotic interaction of Dao techniques!</p><p>“Can’t delay.”</p><p>“If I delay any further, even if my endurance is at its maximum, without being exhausted to the bottom, his Unity Extreme Sword has the attribute of Infinite Number, capable of infinite growth!”</p><p>“Once it surpasses the Holy Emperor level attack, I’m afraid all that’s left for me is to forcibly activate the Ultimate Giant to resist a sword by brute force only.”</p><p>.com</p><p>With such a change in thoughts, Xu Xiaoshou simply did not unleash the Great Silver God’s Wrath; instead, he directly jumped out of this part of the battlefield and looked down with superiority:</p><p>Three Swords Unity, so what?</p><p>With just my Supreme White Day descending, what Flying Cloud Token, Second World, Unity Extreme Sword — all are abandoned!</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>Hidden Bitter retracted.</p><p>Below his feet, the Way of the Sword Disc spun.</p><p>Outside the battlefield, Li Fuyu instantly sensed that the rules had changed, changed into that most familiar scent to him.</p><p>“Swordless Sword Technique, Heavenly Abandon?”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui’s whole person seemed about to go mad, his face burning red, he screamed, “Indeed, Lord Shou only took a glance at Li Fuyu and then copied her sword!”</p><p>Li Fuyu could see in a glance what Feng Zhongzui could perceive; how could Gu Yu not see Xu Xiaoshou’s intentions?</p><p>Heavenly Abandon, if it’s as formidable as Mei Siren’s Wisdom is Emptiness, naturally, it can forcibly elevate his Gu Yu’s Three Swords Unity to the high-class Second Stage of major imagery and completely abandon them.</p><p>Could Xu Xiaoshou do it?</p><p>Gu Yu wanted to say no, but he felt yes.</p><p>But that’s not the point; the point is that he didn’t want to gamble at all!</p><p>At the moment, the array diagram under Xu Xiaoshou’s feet spun, the landscape within the Second World trembled again…</p><p>Once the power of the Swordless Sword Technique was unleashed, it returned!</p><p>“Time is retreating!”</p><p>“Elder Gu is also exerting force, he doesn’t want to let Lord Shou draw his sword at all!”</p><p>These two appearances of the power of time, the first time not keeping up might still be forgivable.</p><p>The second time, if it still couldn’t explain in time, how could Feng Zhongzui possibly obtain this renowned and favorable position from the fiercely competitive Feng Family City?</p><p>But still the same words…</p><p>If even Feng Zhongzui could perceive it, the mighty Lord Shou, wouldn’t he have that consciousness, to predict Gu Yu’s subconscious countermeasures against his Heavenly Abandon?</p><p>And if he could predict in advance, wouldn’t he have measures to counter the countermeasures?</p><p>“Elder Gu, you have aged indeed…”</p><p>A battle consciousness that is more than one step ahead, cultivated by Elder Dao the Flamboyant who always keeps an extra hand, made Xu Xiaoshou, after being affected by the time retardation, not startled but rather pleased.</p><p>Hidden Bitter, in an instant, threw him up into the air, and with an 80% boost from the Way of the Sword Disc, performed a Time-space leap for the first time with Xu Xiaoshou, not across space, but time!</p><p>In the image of the Dao Imparting Mirror, it seemed to the onlookers that behind Lord Shou, a phantom river of time emerged, with Hidden Bitter taking him back to the moment when Gu Yu’s Three Realms Unity and Unity Extreme Sword had just slashed down.</p><p>“How is that possible…”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui was shocked into silence.</p><p>Indeed practicing Fantasy Sword Technique, which correspondingly necessitated the study of both time and space, but that was just auxiliary; the primary focus of Fantasy Sword Technique was still on “illusion.”</p><p>To truly achieve a sword crossing time, this indicated that the swordsman’s comprehension of the path of time had reached a level comparable to a Spiritual Cultivator possessing time attributes!</p><p>To develop a time attribute from nothing…</p><p>How is this an exaggeration?</p><p>This is preposterous to the extreme!</p><p>Looking around at the ancient swordsmen, perhaps in terms of accomplishment in Fantasy Sword Technique, not one exists; one would have to reach the scope of the five regions of the continent.</p><p>“Elder You Tu, the Eighth Sword Immortal, and perhaps at most one Eldest Senior Brother…” Feng Zhongzui could count them all on his fingers, because they are all from the same lineage.</p><p>And now, one more must be added to them, the omnipotent Lord Shou!</p><p>A sword performing a Time-space leap, wanting to change the time under Gu Yu’s Flying Cloud Token is difficult, but changing just his own is very simple.</p><p>A sword at the first level, mixed among these three great second levels, was something no one had anticipated, completely disrupting Gu Yu’s attack rhythm.</p><p>Using minimal force to move a heavy weight!</p><p>On returning to the initial slash of the Unity Extreme Sword, with so much subsequent thought and practice, Xu Xiaoshou’s first choice was no longer only the Great Silver God’s Wrath.</p><p>He couldn’t make the sword cognition’s power in his Unity Extreme Sword return, naturally, he could not violate the time paradox, making the Great Silver God’s Wrath disappear.</p><p>All he did was, after that sword, quickly strike with one more sword.</p><p>“Fantasy Sword Technique, the Second World.”</p><p>Hidden Bitter effortlessly slashed with a sword.</p><p>The intangible sword light vanished into the air.</p><p>The Way of the Sword Disc then extended out, covering an unknown expanse of tens of thousands of miles…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t find Gu Yu, but the area Mei Ziyu could cover after Heavenly Unravel was that large, and his endurance was at its maximum, it could be even larger.</p><p>As such, his Second World, covering Gu Yu’s Flying Cloud Token + Second World + Unity Extreme Sword, was effortlessly accomplished!</p><p>What’s different is…</p><p>Gu Yu’s Second World focuses on the unchanging space, and the retardation of time, due to his shallow practice of Fantasy Sword Technique; his main practice is the Nine Swords Technique.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou however could make every sword his main practice, thus his Second World focuses on the core of Fantasy Sword Technique—Truth-seeking!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
