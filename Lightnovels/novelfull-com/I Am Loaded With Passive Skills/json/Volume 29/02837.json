Do you really think I’m deaf, that I can’t hear you speak?” Gu Yu pointed furiously at Mei Siren.</p><p>“Ah? Who’s speaking?” Mei Siren looked around, searching, and after a full circle, he finally located the source of the voice, his expression turning into one of utter surprise:</p><p>“Elder Brother Gu?”</p><p>“What? You’re really here!”</p><p>“I was saying I felt your presence just now, but I’ve been looking and looking and couldn’t find your eyes… whoa!”</p><p>Mei Siren patted his thigh with the fan as if he had an epiphany, exclaiming strangely: “So you were looking for me too?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gasped in shock; Master Siren also had this side to him?</p><p>He knew that this Gu Yu intended to challenge him in consecutive fights, but he hadn’t expected that the old man had such a particularly good relationship with Master Siren?</p><p>“Good, good, good, good for nothing Mei…”</p><p>Gu Yu, face black as ink, even called out the nickname, wishing he could just run him through with a sword, spearing his sarcastic old friend clean through.</p><p>But verbal skirmishes were meaningless, and he quickly gave up engaging the old fellow, as it would only make the other more smug.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Gu Yu looked back at Xu Xiaoshou with a smile on his face.</p><p>However, as soon as he opened his mouth, the image of Mei Siren wiggling his eyebrows and the faceless paper fan in his hand sprang into his mind.</p><p>The words he had so carefully considered, having steeled himself to challenge his opponent in a public gathering, just wouldn’t emerge after all this time.</p><p>“Elder Gu, please wait a moment, allow me to say a few words first.”</p><p>It was Xu Xiaoshou who spoke first, with a hint more respect in his tone.</p><p>He could tell that Gu Yu was not an enemy—his very essence seemed to declare that he was a man of the First Pavilion in the Sky in life, and would be a ghost of the First Pavilion in the Sky in death.</p><p>The matter of the challenge could naturally be postponed a bit.</p><p>“Please speak, young friend.”</p><p>Gu Yu gestured with his hand, his demeanor pleasant.</p><p>Inadvertently, his glance again caught Mei Siren, who was continuously clicking his tongue, his face scrunched up into an extremely ugly and disagreeable mess, and Gu’s insides nearly burst with anger!</p><p>Mei Siren, I am engaged in a very important matter right now. The ancient swordsman’s challenge ceremony is solemn and sacred!</p><p>What are you doing?</p><p>Look at yourself now; where is the elegance of an ancient swordsman? All that’s left of you is an offensive face, you shameless old disgrace!</p><p>Uh, maybe at this moment he’s thinking the same about me… Gu Yu hated himself for being so empathetic that, in the end, he simply couldn’t bring himself to curse out loud.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded again.</p><p>He had never imagined that Master Siren could contort his face into such vividly malicious expressions.</p><p>He had always prided himself on being dignified and composed. Even if he were to be frivolous, it was that kind of subtle frivolousness that naturally didn’t reveal the tricks up his sleeve, just lightly releasing a hint of mature male charm—the kind of “flirtatiousness” one would expect.</p><p>It was like that time in Taicheng when he had to change his clothes, comb his hair, and make a grand entrance at the last minute to save the day in front of Number Two.</p><p>He had never been like now, making faces, not resembling a teacher at all, but more like a troublesome friend below the podium.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickly regained his senses and took another look at Gu Yu before thoughtfully turning his gaze back to Feng Tingchen, then returning to the main topic:</p><p>“Elder Feng, I gained some insight from my fight just now,” Xu Xiaoshou started.</p><p>“If the Dao Imparting Mirror is to be turned off, it’ll be turned off sooner or later, and if I’m going to visit the Feng family in the Southern Region, I’ll go sooner or later… so why the rush, Elder?”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Feng Tingchen’s complexion immediately became darker than Gu Yu’s, and he spoke in a deep voice: “What do you mean?”</p><p>“Hehe, no particular meaning, just that I am not some pest to be avoided at all costs. Do you dislike us from the First Pavilion in the Sky that much?” Xu Xiaoshou was always straightforward. With a chuckle, he tore through the pretense, splashed the dirty water, and capped the pot, all quite elegantly.</p><p>Feng Tingchen was now in an awkward position: damned if he did, damned if he didn’t.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, however, immediately offered a way out, pointing to the Dao Imparting Mirror and saying, “Why not satisfy the curiosity of the people from the five regions and let them see what Lord Shou has realized from this fight?”</p><p>Feng Tingchen immediately lifted the Dao Imparting Mirror and said earnestly, “What I meant just now was, what do you mean by ‘gained some insight’?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
