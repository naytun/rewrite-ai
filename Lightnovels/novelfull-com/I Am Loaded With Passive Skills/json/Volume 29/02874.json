The God of Sword, Gu Louying, unifies the Nine Swords, ultimately opening the Mystical Gate with the emotion sword technique to transcend extraordinary… What he seeks is to enter the path with Hidden Sword Technique and then to emerge from it.”</p><p>“Gou, on the other hand, specializes in the Mo Sword Technique, studying the word ‘Mo.’ He has developed the Carefreeness, and lost this sword; he cultivated recklessly, and committed himself to the most strict Holy Divine Palace, becoming a mess like Senior Rao Yaoyao, who deviated in her sword path, with diminishing combat strength.”</p><p>“But actually, that’s not the case! I used to not understand why this was, but later the Pavilion Masters discussed this, saying, ‘In rules, find the rule-less; in cages, break the cage’… Hmm, exact words of Bazhun’an.”</p><p>Mo Sword Technique, third realm, huh?</p><p>Xiao Xu spaced out slightly, remembering that scene in the Eighth Palace.</p><p>He recalled that back then, Lord Bazhun’an had even advised Old Gou to give up struggling and leave the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>At that time, being young, he didn’t understand what Old Gou was struggling with.</p><p>Looking back now, it turns out that Lord Eight was asking someone to give up decades of hard cultivation, he was seizing the other’s path!</p><p>No wonder Old Gou, although defeated, refused to give up…</p><p>Xiao Xu then thought of Old Gou’s sworn enemy, who was also his own Master:</p><p>“Elder Sang, how do you see it?”</p><p>Li Fugui represented not just himself, but the entire intelligence aggregation of the Saint Servants!</p><p>If they were to discuss heroes over drinks, they might as well lay it all out.</p><p>At the sound, Li Fugui just sipped a bit and said:</p><p>“For Elder Sang, alchemy and combat strength are like combat strength and intelligence for Sleeveless—his former is low, his latter high.”</p><p>“The Four Disciples of the Holy Palace are also very strong. Currently, Demi-saint Ye might even surpass the Moon Sword Immortal.”</p><p>“But in terms of purpose…”</p><p>He put down his wine cup, one hand high, the other low:</p><p>“The Ten High Nobles alone are on this level,”</p><p>“The Four Disciples of the Holy Palace, the Water Ghost, Chief Yama, and other prodigies… are on this level.”</p><p>The gap between the hands was not large.</p><p>But the implication from Li Fugui was clear—hard to reach their back!</p><p>“Of course, that is not absolute.” Li Fugui dared not speak absolutely, “There are always exceptions, but I’m not clear on that.”</p><p>Xiao Xu tapped his fingers lightly against the cup, silent for a long time.</p><p>In terms of purpose, perhaps only Elder Qiao could match up, and of course, just like Old Gou, he feared aiming too high and failing.</p><p>“Inverted Buddha Pagoda.” He spoke again.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“The You Yuan Buddha, I can only recall following the Ten High Nobles’ incantation, he should be close to the Holy Emperor realm.”</p><p>“And indeed, no matter how much effort I put into gathering information, concerning this figure, there’s only one trace—the inverted Buddha Pagoda.”</p><p>Li Fugui mentioned this while squinting into the distance, remembering for a while before continuing:</p><p>“The inverted pagoda at Cross Corner Street possesses mysterious and formidable power, seemingly capable of blocking the Way of the Heavens’ energy movement… Mm, not Hallmaster Dao’s kind of Way of the Heavens’ energy movement, but it’s included nonetheless, hence no one can calculate it.”</p><p>“It is said to have come from ancient times, as mysterious as the sword tower, also suppressing something.”</p><p>“The Divine too chose it for a reason, he seeks to follow the Guidance of You Yuan, to reach the inverted Buddha Pagoda, to sanctify within…”</p><p>“What ‘Saint’?” Xiao Xu pursued, requiring a clear definition of ‘Saint’ for the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>Li Fugui shook his head vaguely, admitting his ignorance:</p><p>“Perhaps, the ‘Saint’ of the Holy Emperor.”</p><p>“Or perhaps, the inverted Buddha Pagoda still holds some opportunity, after all, You Yuan Buddha has reached the Holy Emperor State… this ‘Saint’ could naturally also be the saint of becoming Gods and Ancestor.”</p><p>Damn!</p><p>That reckless man!</p><p>Xiao Xu felt some sympathy for Ye Xiaotian’s jealousy, but temporarily suppressed it.</p><p>The Divine and the inverted Buddha Pagoda, including what You Yuan Guidance, all could find answers face-to-face in the Ran Ming ruins.</p><p>Li Fugui knew as much as that, asking further probably wouldn’t yield much more.</p><p>He then remembered another man he had somewhat crossed paths with—Soul Stirring Brother.</p><p>“And the Holy Emperor Bei Clan, what realm is he in?” Xiao Xu played with his wine cup.</p><p>“Unclear, but he must be a high realm Holy Emperor.”</p><p>“That means he possesses the power of the ancestral source.” Xiao Xu had his thoughts, “That’s enough for ordinary people, but for the Ten High Nobles, it’s just the beginning… if he gets stuck in high realm Holy Emperor, even if it’s Level Nine or tenth level Holy Emperor, if he’s just a half step away from becoming a legend and sealing his Godhood, how could he be content?”</p><p>Li Fugui was somewhat at a loss for words now, thinking, Lord Shou, you hold me in too high esteem!</p><p>“Lord Shou, as you know, Fugui doesn’t know everything, this question, you might have to discuss directly with Lord Bazhun’an.”</p><p>“Oh.” Xiao Xu couldn’t help being disappointed.</p><p>“But regarding that member of the Bei family, his little quirk from the era of the Ten High Nobles, I do know a bit.”</p><p>“Let’s hear it!”</p><p>“He’s a ‘research scholar’ similar to Elder Zhong, but he is obsessed with life; maybe if he’s ‘stuck’ in high realm Holy Emperor, it’s just to experiment?” Li Fugui was not entirely sure.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
