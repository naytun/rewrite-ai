Death_2</p><p>“`</p><p>He finally understood why Master Siren had offered that one piece of advice previously, but still allowed Elder Gu his freedom in the end, without any unnecessary interference.</p><p>It’s too beautiful!</p><p>The Way of transcendence that is beyond this world, who wouldn’t be moved?</p><p>But just like Gu Yu’s past conflicted choices, this was also a path destined for defeat and death!</p><p>With such a flawed foundation in the Great Path, how could Gu Yu survive forcibly opening the Mystical Gate of the Secular Sword?</p><p>But from another perspective…</p><p>Who could stop fireworks from blooming splendidly?</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou could only appreciate and ponder.</p><p>.com</p><p>“Perception” was able to detect all the ancient swordsmen present, as well as the Spiritual Cultivators, each of them deeply moved.</p><p>Mei Siren covered his face with a fan, staring absent-mindedly, the fan painted with a school, two withered trees, and the lonely silhouette of a solitary figure on a meditation cushion.</p><p>The light scattered on the paper fan as if it were blossoming with the fragrance of peach and plum.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing slightly tilted his head back, his expression stunned, the Divine-beating Crutch in his hand buzzing and vibrating, signifying that his heart was not as calm as it seemed on the surface.</p><p>The light fell on his eye-covering cloth, as if decorating new eyes upon the world.</p><p>Li Fuyu’s red lips parted slightly, also staring at that Mystical Gate opening at the apex of the sword tower.</p><p>She saw a figure with an indistinct face walk out from within the gate, and with a casual swing of the sword, divine light sprinkled across the five regions, descending with the “Way” of the sword.</p><p>Suddenly snapping to awareness, Li Fuyu returned from the “Mysteries” of the Mystical Gate, realizing that everyone around her was immersed in it.</p><p>“The Path…”</p><p>The Path, is invisible and intangible.</p><p>Yet, the Path can also be transmitted.</p><p>Coming from the sword tower, Li Fuyu, after mingling with the world, never underestimated the ancient swordsmen of this world.</p><p>The previous generation of Sword Humans of the sword tower told her that the Sword Humans of the sword tower only ever guarded “the Sword,” not “the Path.”</p><p>The Path is not locked in the tower, the Path is in the world.</p><p>The era of the ancient swordsmen has long passed, to be able to continue passing down in the Spiritual Cultivation Era, the sword tower only played a role like a guiding star.</p><p>The ones truly naming the nameless Path, and walking the unwalkable Path, are the people of the world!</p><p>Among them, there must be dazzling geniuses like Bazhun’an who amassed the strengths of all, leading the times uniquely, with unmatched elegance;</p><p>There must also be downward-compatible individuals like Mei Siren, who impart the Path and teach, carrying forward the essence of a hundred schools, encouraging the people in their modesty;</p><p>There are also new generations like Xiao Kongtong, Beibei, and Feng Zhongzui, who serve as the pillars of heritage, adhering to their own Path, and innovating upon the old;</p><p>Of course, there must be individuals like Elder Gu Yu, who in the end, burned themselves up, transformed into ashes, all to prove the correct direction.</p><p>Every person in the transmission of the Path of the Ancient Swordsman plays an indispensable role, whether they are aware of it or not.</p><p>It’s precisely this small group of people, who painstakingly forge ahead under the deluge of the Spiritual Cultivation Era.</p><p>And what they get in return is nothing but a meager hope for a wee bit of acknowledgment…</p><p>Fame!</p><p>…</p><p>Under the Mystical Gate, the Upanishad of the Great Path emerges.</p><p>Gu Yu turned around clearly, looking like he was struck by a Heavenly Abandon, his clothes and skin disappearing bit by bit, a literal merger with the light and dust.</p><p>He was clearly saying something!</p><p>In the Arena, facing the Dao Imparting Mirror, everyone eagerly strained their ears, hoping to catch some meaning.</p><p>Gu Yu was clearly speaking, but no one could hear the words from his mouth, nor grasp the meaning he wished to express.</p><p>The Path that can be tread is not the eternal Path.</p><p>The name that can be named is not the eternal name.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou even tried to understand what Elder Gu was saying using the Lip Reading Technique, only to eventually realize he had been fixated on the wrong thing.</p><p>Perhaps this moment was truly when Gu Yu was closest to the True Will of the Path, closest to Godhood-Sealing and Ancestor, but it was his opportunity.</p><p>Even if he wanted to leave something behind, his original intention was to prove the Path for the people.</p><p>But when it involves that level, even the Holy Emperor would be forgotten by the people, how could what he gained leave any trace?</p><p>The crowd saw an increasing desperation in Gu Yu’s eyes, his expression, and even his hands started moving, gesturing something toward the Dao Imparting Mirror.</p><p>Bathed in divine light, carrying the Mystical Gate on his back, he descended from Heaven, truly an Immortal of the Sword.</p><p>But exactly because he was so ethereal, unworldly, he seemed to have an insurmountable chasm separating him from humanity.</p><p>Communication impossible!</p><p>Unattainable aspirations!</p><p>This was never the intention of Gu Yu.</p><p>Mei Siren put down the paper fan, returning as well from the “Mysteries,” looked fiercely at Xu Xiaoshou, about to speak…</p><p>In that very instant, Xu Xiaoshou saw Gu Yu’s mouthing and hand gestures come to a halt, then he fixed his gaze firmly on him.</p><p>“Sizz!”</p><p>Every hair on his body stood on end in an instant, as if he was marked by the god of death.</p><p>The Information Bar also jumped:</p><p>“Ambushed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Sharp as he was, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t need any reminders from Master Siren to know what Gu Yu meant in this moment:</p><p>Explanations fail to express.</p><p>But this third sword is prepared for you.</p><p>If you can withstand it… surely, without saying, without stating, upon your very body, you ought to realize?</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shouted.</p><p>Fearing that Elder Gu couldn’t hear his voice, he even stretched out a finger, provocatively beckoning him.</p><p>But shout as he might, how could he be careless with the Mystical Gate opened by the Third Realm!</p><p>Rules of ancient swordsmen’s duel forgotten, his animalistic instincts ignited in his mind…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Raging Giant enters the Arena!</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The Ultimate Giant lowers its gaze!</p><p>“Hum!”</p><p>The Life Dao Disc unfolds!</p><p>“Human Realm Dao!”</p><p>Combination of the Six Paths of ancient martial arts!</p><p>“Meow~”</p><p>Err, ghost beast form…</p><p>It’s not a joke, at this moment, Xu Xiaoshou was truly frightened.</p><p>He tapped into every endurance boost he could muster, to avoid being instantly slain by Elder Gu.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
