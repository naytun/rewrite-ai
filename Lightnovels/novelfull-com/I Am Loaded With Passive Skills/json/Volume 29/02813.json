If it were anyone else, they would only get one sword strike in return…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s voice appeared in time, softening his tone, and finally added gravely, “The Holy Divine Palace is no longer the Holy Divine Palace it once was, neither in terms of its outward reputation nor its inner essence!”</p><p>Fang Wenxin’s body trembled, and he looked up in a daze, flashes of the dark organisation of Red Coats over the years in his mind, leaving him no room to refute.</p><p>After hearing this, Xu Xiaoshou really wanted to stuff an Apricot Realm jade talisman in his face…</p><p>But he knew that Fang Wenxin was not Zhong Yuanzi; he was not a fool and couldn’t be dealt with so directly.</p><p>His emotional attachment to Red Coat (first generation) and his concern for the safety of the continent far outweighed that of merely Xu Xiaoshou, a mere owner of the First Pavilion in the Sky by countless times!</p><p>Back in Jade Capital City, Xu Xiaoshou chuckled and said,</p><p>“Elder Fang’s words are all illusions; we needn’t talk more about it.”</p><p>“This Jade Capital City now belongs to me; all its people belong to me. Whether they are alive or dead, all are within a thought of mine.”</p><p>Jade Capital City immediately became chaotic.</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi glanced at the speechless Fang Wenxin and could only say, “We can let go of other things, but there must be other ways to trade a whole city’s populace with you, right?”</p><p>“Moved by plea, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned to look, seeing Elder Zhong with a compassionate look and a hint of pleading in his eyes.</p><p>Seeing this plea, Xu Xiaoshou felt an endearment as if only those close to him would have such emotions.</p><p>Good, half of Zhong Yuanzi belonged to the First Pavilion in the Sky now!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou added fuel to the fire and said firmly, “Yes!”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi’s eyes lit up, he quietly sent a grateful look, and for the sake of the civilians, he loudly asked, “Lord Shou, please tell us, what do you want?”</p><p>The countless civilians and Spiritual Cultivators inside Jade Capital City were filled with anticipation; as long as they could keep their lives, anything would do!</p><p>But Lord Shou remained silent for a while.</p><p>He stood there in the void, staring intently at the explosive-haired Elemental Divine Envoy who had just spoken, gazing until everyone was puzzled, gazing until even Zhong Yuanzi was baffled…</p><p>Finally, almost simultaneously, everyone shuddered, sensing something, with Zhong Yuanzi being particularly shocked!</p><p>It was at this moment that Xu Xiaoshou, after a long build-up, finally had tears welling up in his eyes:</p><p>“Elder Zhong has been considering the Spiritual Cultivators across the world, spending a century studying the ‘Great Path Diagram’ and vowing to benefit the five regions by forging a new path for Spiritual Cultivation.”</p><p>“For the sake of the residents of Yujing, you’re willing to condescend to make such a plea to a proud junior like me, filling my heart with sorrow.”</p><p>While speaking, Xu Xiaoshou “involuntarily” took a few steps forward, “unable to control” his urge to take Elder Zhong’s hand, but seemed to stop himself due to remembering their respective positions and the urge to hold hands.</p><p>In the end, he raised his hands solemnly, tossing the Dao Imparting Mirror back, and with tears in his eyes said from a distance,</p><p>“In my eyes, a mere Jade Capital City is nothing compared to a fraction of Elder Zhong’s threefold sincere emotions!”</p><p>This…</p><p>Jade Capital City was shaken.</p><p>Feng Zhongzui was shaken, clutching the Dao Imparting Mirror, broadcasting this “touching” scene everywhere.</p><p>The people of the five regions were even more stunned. Lord Shou was up to some trickery; this sudden display was only disgusting…</p><p>But in the scene, they saw Lord Shou, while speaking, squat down.</p><p>Behind him, Lei Xi’er, Mei Siren and others furrowed their brows, feeling almost sick at heart, and quickly turned away to avoid seeing any more.</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi was scared, thinking Young Master Xu had gone mad and wanted to kneel before him, “This should not be, this should not be…”</p><p>Of course, Xu Xiaoshou was not kneeling; he had just squatted down and touched Elder Zhong’s spirit boots.</p><p>Uh, there are no laces…</p><p>The atmosphere became awkward for a moment, but soon he grabbed his own sleeve, shook his head and said, “It’s dirty.”</p><p>Then, while wiping Elder Zhong’s gleaming, spotless spirit boots, he raised his voice and said,</p><p>“If you are willing to join the First Pavilion in the Sky, I, Xu Xiaoshou, might as well give up this whole great Jade Capital City.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
