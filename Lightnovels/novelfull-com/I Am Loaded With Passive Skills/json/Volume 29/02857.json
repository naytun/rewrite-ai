She didn’t know what Elder Gu intended, yet it felt like she could foresee the future.</p><p>In the Eighth Palace.</p><p>Having digested the insights from the Spirit Viewing Sword Technique, Xiao Qixiu’s eyes widened as he stared again at the Dao Imparting Mirror.</p><p>This mirror truly “imparted the Dao.” Just the three battles involving Xu Xiaoshou could elevate the realm of every ancient swordsman in the world by more than one level!</p><p>In the Southern Region.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng, Feng Xiaose, and others stared intently at the mirror.</p><p>.com</p><p>Elder Wuyue and Bazhun’an also appeared thoughtful, their gazes continuously shifting between Mei Siren and Elder Gu.</p><p>In the midst of the battle.</p><p>Seeing the heroic, self-sacrificing aura emanating from Elder Gu, Xu Xiaoshou tightened his grip on his sword and decisively proclaimed,</p><p>“I’m not fighting anymore!”</p><p>Elder Gu turned his head to look.</p><p>Everyone followed the view of the Dao Imparting Mirror.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou spread his hands and heh’d, saying,</p><p>“I concede.”</p><p>At that moment, he too sensed the ominous turn of events, because he also thought of Su Qianqian.</p><p>However, unlike her, Xu Xiaoshou felt he had become the Bazhun’an of that era, while Elder Gu was about to become a soul vanquished by his sword.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had gone from not approving of Bazhun’an’s actions against the Su family to now respecting the brave spirits of his era, who for honor and the Path could sacrifice their lives.</p><p>But respect is one thing; it didn’t mean he wanted to become that kind of person and similarly “achieve” that for others.</p><p>His sword would only strike those deserving.</p><p>Aside from that, unless necessary, Xu Xiaoshou would not recklessly play with “life.”</p><p>Elder Gu seemed to know what this young man was thinking.</p><p>This time, he struggled to his feet unaided and steadied himself.</p><p>He summoned the heavily damaged Mei Ziyu with a gesture—one that had been tempered in Heavenly Unravel.</p><p>Caressing the sword in his hand, his gaze swept over the faces of ancient swordsmen around him, finally settling somberly on the Dao Imparting Mirror, his voice growing impassioned:</p><p>“I wield a sword, to account for the past, to be responsible for choices, to seek clarity in the path ahead!”</p><p>“I wield a sword, to cut through cowardice, to sever indecision, to reflect on my true heart!”</p><p>“I wield a sword!” Elder Gu’s voice suddenly deepened, he turned his head, looking at Xu Xiaoshou, his tone becoming very low:</p><p>“I am lost, and I cannot return.”</p><p>“I hope you’ll remember it well, remember it for me.”</p><p>After a pause, he looked back at the Dao Imparting Mirror, his eyes lingering, he shouted loudly:</p><p>“Remember it!”</p><p>Just as Xu Xiaoshou was about to speak,</p><p>Elder Gu suddenly threw his sword upward, his eyes blazing with a fierce Sword Will, and in a flash, man and sword became one.</p><p>Mei Ziyu, Heavenly Unravel the second time!</p><p>“Pitter-patter…”</p><p>The gently falling raindrops descended once more, now filled with resolve and decisiveness, no longer hesitating as before.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s stunned gaze turned to Master Siren.</p><p>The latter said nothing, just sighed deeply, and then spirited away from the Arena.</p><p>No one knew better than Mei Siren how significant the change Elder Gu had made at that moment; he could have sheathed his sword and spared himself, as well as the Path of the Ancient Swordsman.</p><p>But that was his life.</p><p>Nobody could influence someone’s choice to live a peaceful life or to blaze brilliantly for a fleeting moment.</p><p>As a friend, the best wish at that moment was to fulfill his desire.</p><p>The turn of events in the Arena happened too quickly; Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t react, nor could anyone else.</p><p>Feng Zhongzui gripping the Dao Imparting Mirror didn’t know what would be shown next. He could only continue to enlarge the image, his sense of its magnitude growing.</p><p>Suddenly, within the area affected by Heavenly Unravel after Mei Ziyu…</p><p>“Humming trembling roaring!”</p><p>Sword energy surged wildly, combining the auras of the Nine Major Sword Techniques, finally coalescing into an array diagram.</p><p>Another one lit up!</p><p>And another one!</p><p>One more!</p><p>“One, two, three, four… seven? Seven Upanishad Formation Diagrams? A full seven from the second stage?” Feng Zhongzui clutched the Dao Imparting Mirror, his hands still, but his eyes nearly popping out, “What does Elder Gu want to do? Has he gone mad?!”</p><p>His response.</p><p>The response awaited by the world.</p><p>Was no longer the recurring “Flying Cloud,” nor the word-worn “flowing light,” but a decisively unstoppable voice:</p><p>“Entering this world, never to exit.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, watch closely… Unlock! Mystical Gate!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
