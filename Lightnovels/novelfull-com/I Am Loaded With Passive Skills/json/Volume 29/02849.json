Brother Shou’s strength lies in his learning talent, and this has some connection with what Li Fuyu showed before…”</p><p>Form merged with intent, intent with qi, and from this merger, consciousness was born.</p><p>Starting with the initial cultivation of consciousness on the Black Cliff of the Tiansang Spirit Palace, from the moment he harnessed Swallow the Mountains and Rivers, through Tiansang City, White Cave, Yunlun Mountain Range, to Abyss Island, and now to Sword Suppressing Jade Capital.</p><p>From being ambushed by killers like Feng Kong, Red Dog, and Golden Foot, to demi-saints like Rao Yaoyao and the Holy Emperor Rao Wangze, and then actively battling the Holy Emperor Qilin, Holy Emperor Bei Huai, Yu Fangzhong, and Dao Xuanji…</p><p>.com</p><p>It could be said that it was through this journey of battles, a chain of victories, coupled with the transition from a passive participant to actively volunteering, that Xu Xiaoshou cultivated his own unique brand of domineering confidence.</p><p>The moment his sword cognition turned intangible and merged with the pressure, becoming a deterrence, intending to force out Gu Yu’s trump card with an unconscious use, Xu Xiaoshou felt enlightenment for the first time.</p><p>An enlightenment all his own, without relying on Unity of Man and the Heavens or any of the Great Dao Discs!</p><p>“Oppression-type Penetrating Divine Senses?”</p><p>As if shackles before his eyes had shattered, Xu Xiaoshou felt like a dragon returning to the sea, utterly carefree and joyously unreserved.</p><p>This was the true feeling of enlightenment!</p><p>Was this the power of Kui Leihan’s “awareness” that he glimpsed?</p><p>His newly acquired ability subdued, his “Perception” scanning the astonished expressions of everyone around him, Xu Xiaoshou had some realizations:</p><p>Perhaps it wasn’t about becoming one of the Seven Sword Deities and thriving on the nourishment of fame that led to success.</p><p>It was because he had fought his way to the level of the Seven Sword Deities that all his past accumulations had thinly emanated at the moment when people noticed.</p><p>This created the illusion that just one look or one word could lead to mastering Penetrating Divine Senses, and a single closing of the eyes or sitting cross-legged could transcend an era.</p><p>But it wasn’t that way at all.</p><p>There was never a quick fix; it was all about letting things happen naturally.</p><p>This… this was true wisdom… Xu Xiaoshou deeply agreed, and quickly paused his thoughts to silently add that Bazhun’an, the talent hound, was an exception.</p><p>“What kind of monster is this?”</p><p>Gu Yu felt goosebumps rising all over him at that moment, sensing that Xu Xiaoshou had grasped a whole new power.</p><p>This was more exaggerated than the consciousness Li Fuyu had demonstrated during his observation because Xu Xiaoshou also cultivated various other great paths and systems.</p><p>His “awareness” was much stronger than that of others.</p><p>Combined with the potential for growth he displayed during his battle with many demi-saints from the Holy Divine Palace, he surely had many more tricks up his sleeve.</p><p>But the oppressive Penetrating Divine Senses were fleeting, and Xu Xiaoshou clearly did not want to show too much. Gu Yu certainly didn’t fancy the awkwardness of testing Xu Xiaoshou’s new trump card.</p><p>The abilities he openly displayed were already too much for anyone to cope with!</p><p>Hum…</p><p>Without a second word.</p><p>Once he realized this monster was truly beyond human, and that there was no room for holding back anymore, Gu Yu’s Power Upanishad Formation beneath his feet lit up.</p><p>At the same time, the sword held in his hand, Mei Ziyu, began to emit a misty rain ascending from the sword body.</p><p>“Here it comes!”</p><p>“The ultimate meaning of the Nine Swords Technique?”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui’s eyes heated up at the sight. It was a basic pairing for the second stage of the current generation of Seven Sword Deities, as expected.</p><p>“Wait a minute…”</p><p>His gaze suddenly fixed on the array diagram with a mix of shock and suspicion. “It seems there’s also a trace of other sword techniques?”</p><p>Nine Major Sword Techniques, Unity Extreme Sword, right?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quietly waited, but what flashed through his mind were the appellations of the major sword flows.</p><p>At this moment, following the order of Phantom Sword Technique, Emotionless Sword Technique, and Emotion Sword Technique, and after having experienced the Second World — Void, Wrath of the Great Crimson God, Void, Heavenly Abandon, Wisdom is Emptiness, Void, Void, Mountains and Seas Converge —</p><p>He hadn’t seen the “Four Great Emptiness,” which represented the second stage of The Unity Extreme Sword, Mo’s Desireless Sword, Lord of Phantom City, and the third stage of the emotion sword technique, Secular Sword.</p><p>Hidden Sword Technique had no second realm, so it wasn’t part of the “Void” category.</p><p>These four great second stages, the Way of the Sword Disc, had basically walked him through the beginner’s phase; if he wanted to use them, he could.</p><p>But, as with the examples in the books, without personal use or seeing others use them creatively, the impression is never as profound as actual practice.</p><p>The Lord of Phantom City seemed not to be deeply mastered even by Li Fuyu, who could only draw a sword; Xu Xiaoshou only had knowledge of Sword Deity Hua Changdeng majoring in ghost swordsmanship and dared not challenge him or learn the sword, especially since the latter was suspected of having reached sanctification.</p><p>As for the Secular Sword, it’s needless to say; it seemed no one practiced it, maybe Bazhun’an could? He’ll have to ask when he has the chance!</p><p>As for the Carefreeness, perhaps the only one who deeply studied it was Gou Wuyue, who still sought freedom under the strict order of the Holy Divine Palace; he should learn from him when he gets the chance.</p><p>That left only this Unity Extreme Sword…</p><p>Gu Qinger of the Burial Sword Tomb was a major in the Nine Swords Technique; his Supreme Master Wen Ting might know it, or might have a deep study of it, but there was no chance for a meeting in the short term.</p><p>Gu Yu today, who also practiced the Nine Swords Technique, could provide some direction at least.</p><p>However…</p><p>“These Nine Swords Technique… why does it not feel quite right? Neither truly phantom nor truly emotional…” Xu Xiaoshou furrowed his brow, sensing a big trap.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, this is the second sword.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
