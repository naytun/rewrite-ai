it can be said to be on the same level…”</p><p>“Are you certain?” Xiao Qixiu repeated like a broken record, but this time he didn’t wait for a reply before coming to his own conclusion.</p><p>Old Qiao couldn’t have seen it wrong.</p><p>Conflicted, Xiao Qixiu tried to deceive himself: “Is it because of the Imitator?”</p><p>“A red herring!” Qiao Qianzhi shook his head, “The Imitator is definitely just a red herring!”</p><p>“So, he’s purely relying on his realization quality?” The words made Xiao Qixiu even more confounded.</p><p>Outsiders might think Xu Xiaoshou’s realization quality is incredible, given he excels in various disciplines with mastery.</p><p>Yet those within the Tiansang Spirit Palace understood that while Xu Xiaoshou was exceptional in certain areas, such as swords, his fire and space attributes were actually ordinary.</p><p>This ordinariness wasn’t in comparison to normal Spiritual Cultivators, but rather in comparison with peers who were geniuses or with Ye Xiaotian.</p><p>At the very least, regarding Spatial Path alone, Xu Xiaoshou was too ordinary, even mundane.</p><p>Yet Ye Xiaotian took decades just to grasp Spatial Upanishad!</p><p>For the even more mediocre Xu Xiaoshou, from nothing to something, all it took was a drop of blood and a dozen or so Aura time?</p><p>“No, no, no, I need to think this through…” Xiao Qixiu felt his brain itching, something seemed about to split open – no, worse, it was his worldviews!</p><p>“Is it possible that the Imitator played a significant assistive role and Ye Xiaotian’s Holy Blood also had some influence?” Xiao Qixiu looked at Old Qiao, who was staring and pondering at the mirror, and communicated telepathically again.</p><p>“No,” Qiao Qianzhi dismissed the notion decisively without even bothering to explain.</p><p>If the Imitator was that miraculous, it would be more than just one of the Great Psionic Weapons; Yi wouldn’t have lost it due to a lack of ability.</p><p>Even with only one attribute, Yi could have fostered talents of that attribute from all over the world, harvesting them like eggs from chickens until the Upanishad was compiled.</p><p>Yi didn’t have it.</p><p>Clearly, that approach was a dead end.</p><p>Because the Imitator wasn’t that powerful… Xiao Qixiu could see this for himself quite quickly.</p><p>So, what path was Xu Xiaoshou actually taking while using the Imitator as a cover?</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi stared intently at the Dao Imparting Mirror, his eyes fixed on Xu Xiaoshou who had completed his breakthrough and now had his eyes closed in meditation, surrounded by a swirling spiritual source, full of vitality.</p><p>“Got any conclusions?” Xiao Qixiu leaned over to ask.</p><p>In Qiao Qianzhi’s mind flashed the various Upanishad ‘Diagrams’ that Xu Xiaoshou had severed, some illusory, some concrete…</p><p>But all had truly existed!</p><p>“There must be a way for him to illuminate the ‘Diagram’… and then nourish himself with it, perhaps?” Qiao Qianzhi speculated as his eyes lifted.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Xiao Qixiu was completely lost.</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi took a glance at him, then lowered his gaze again, muttering to himself as if he had an insight or was going insane, “Old Xiao, do you think…”</p><p>“What?” Xiao Qixiu promptly leaned in closer.</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi gestured with his fingers as if lost in a potential insight or delusion:</p><p>“Is there such a possibility?”</p><p>“Right now, I’m just an Innate Stage Spirit Array Caster, but what if I unexpectedly acquired a Saint Stage spirit array diagram, which I treat as the ‘standard answer’?”</p><p>“While I currently can’t comprehend the subtleties of this ‘standard answer,’ my talent lies in precise control, capable of setting up this Saint Stage spiritual array almost accurately, with similar effects…”</p><p>“Being such, should I be considered an Innate Stage Spirit Array Caster or a Holy-level Spirit Array Master?”</p><p>Xiao Qixiu was baffled.</p><p>We are talking about Xu Xiaoshou, why are you mentioning this… wait, this analogy?</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi’s eyes flashed with a glint, and as he continued gesturing, he abruptly raised his head, nearly bumping noses with Xiao Qixiu, and said:</p><p>“I first use this standard answer, strengthen myself with it, and while using it, I slowly digest and comprehend the underlying meanings within the answer, is that possible?”</p><p>“Stepping back and looking at it, isn’t this ‘using’ process just the ’embodiment’ process? And am I not bypassing Innate and approaching the Sacred Secret Land?”</p><p>“Because this is the standard answer! A direct standard answer to demi-saint!”</p><p>Xiao Qixiu spat and backed away, now even more puzzled, “What are you actually trying to say?”</p><p>“The answer, the answer…” Qiao Qianzhi murmured, his eyes growing brighter and pupils darting around, “That’s it. Then where does the standard answer come from, and what if it isn’t standard? Wouldn’t I just be stuck at Sacred Secret Land?”</p><p>“Old Qiao?”</p><p>“Old Qiao! Snap out of it!”</p><p>Xiao Qixiu felt the man wasn’t having an insight but was deviating… Forget Sacred Secret Land, first breakthrough Sovereign, man!</p><p>He slapped Old Qiao’s face, “Wake up! We are discussing serious matters here!”</p><p>With such a smack, Qiao Qianzhi’s gaze suddenly fixed on the mountain far behind the Dao Imparting Mirror.</p><p>The mountain range stretched on, dotted with tall trees, surrounding villages and towns, extending into the Eighth Palace, forming a “natural diagram;”</p><p>The people on the road, the mirrors in the marketplace, the winding grass paths leading straight up to the Sky, traced out lines of “natural patterns.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
