Raising his voice, he said, “Someone has lodged a complaint against you, saying…”</p><p>“Who approaches?”</p><p>The judge was interrupted and became flustered.</p><p>He looked incredulously at Ai Cangsheng, who had spoken, and then lowered his gaze to point at his own golden robe.</p><p>“I am a golden-robed judge from the judicial department atop the Stairway to Heaven, representing the Five Great Holy Emperor…”</p><p>“Are you a Holy Emperor?”</p><p>“Eh, no, I merely represent…”</p><p>“Are you the Supreme Judge?”</p><p>“Eh, not exactly, I am…”</p><p>“Then why do you not kneel upon seeing me, the Emperor?”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng turned the wheelchair around, but his gaze drifted past the judge and far off into the distance, as if ignoring air itself.</p><p>His shocking words rendered everyone speechless.</p><p>Beibei and the others were fearful, unsure why Lord Cang Sheng would dare to speak such words.</p><p>This was a golden-robed judge, someone who could admonish Hallmaster Dao and to whom even Hallmaster Xuanji had to speak politely.</p><p>Lord Cang Sheng’s surname was not Yue Bei Hua Rao Dao, it was just Ai. How could he be so bold?</p><p>The judge himself was also stunned, seldom having seen anyone who disregarded the authority represented by his golden robe. He stood in shock for a long while before erupting with rage:</p><p>“Ai Cangsheng, how dare you utter…”</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The Evil Sin Bow was raised and pulled to a full crescent, with Holy Power gathering.</p><p>The judge abruptly fell silent, his pupils trembling.</p><p>“What are you doing?!”</p><p>His voice almost shattered as he spoke, the knees hidden beneath his golden robe starting to shake uncontrollably as he yelled with feigned bravado, “Ai Cangsheng, to execute a judge is a capital offense!”</p><p>Boom!!!</p><p>The bowstring of the Evil Sin Bow resonated with an alarming twang.</p><p>This familiar sound jolted Elder Yu, who had almost slipped down completely from the great array, back to the surface.</p><p>What kind of joke was this?</p><p>Was Ai Cangsheng killing again?</p><p>Merely visiting the Ran Ming ruins had made him this murderous?</p><p>Leaping atop the peak of Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, Elder Yu came across Elder Fang and Elder Zhong, who were arriving in haste.</p><p>Their exchanged glances confirmed for each other that both the Saint Hall and the old site of Jade Capital City were largely secure, and their nerves slightly relaxed.</p><p>“It’s good no one’s gone…”</p><p>…</p><p>Central Region, City of the Dead Bodhisattva.</p><p>One after another, death apostles went to the Ran Ming ruins, and from there they were killed and sent back, causing the words “god slayer” to stir up a frenzy.</p><p>This was one of the few games in recent years where people could “travel” out of the city without dying.</p><p>Those manning the Divine Palace on this side were struggling to contain the chaos being wreaked by these mad apostles.</p><p>Rumors such as “Lord Cang Sheng has been slain by The Divine, and when The Divine returns, he will take command of the City of the Dead Bodhisattva at Cross Corner Street and launch a campaign against the Holy Divine Palace” were utterly outrageous.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
