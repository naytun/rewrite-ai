Why would he bother competing with the next generation?</p><p>With a Sword Path Disc at 80% proficiency, Xu Xiaoshou’s realm and vision were too high. He realized Gu Yu’s swordsmanship was clearly not at the same level of understanding as his.</p><p>But there must be some method that allowed him to temporarily rise above, breaching the 70% or 80% threshold for a brief moment.</p><p>.com</p><p>Then…</p><p>What was it?</p><p>The mist of rain on Gu Yu’s sword became denser until even the entire blade was enveloped in the mist, gradually dissipating.</p><p>At the same time, his whole being shook and transformed into a wisp of wandering cloud before merging into the heavens and earth.</p><p>“This is!” Feng Zhongzui screamed from in front of the Dao Imparting Mirror, followed by a pause, “…What is it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shaken. “Heavenly Unravel?” He quickly interrupted himself, “No… not just that!”</p><p>At that moment, from the Arena where Gu Yu’s trace was lost, a melodious voice pierced through the Dao Imparting Mirror:</p><p>“Jiangnan mist and rain, Dragon Apricot blooms and withers.”</p><p>“Flying Clouds mark the seasons, mountains and rivers return to…”</p><p>A pause came as everyone held their breath in anticipation, and the final word was revealed:</p><p>“Hometown.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stumbled, feeling exceedingly uncomfortable.</p><p>The semantics were incoherent, the rhyme was off, the imagery, if there was any, lacked focus, and if there wasn’t, several were still listed…</p><p>What did it mean?</p><p>What was Gu Yu trying to express?</p><p>This cryptic passage left everyone immersed in whether they lacked cultural knowledge to understand it.</p><p>At last, a voice everyone could understand came from between heaven and earth.</p><p>“Mei Ziyu·Heavenly Unravel!”</p><p>It really was Heavenly Unravel? Feng Zhongzui immediately abandoned the idea of delving deeper into that obscure segment to return his attention to the battle.</p><p>But then, as spring rain began to fall from the sky, an occasional drop landing on his arm…</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>The skin wrinkled instantly.</p><p>It was as if all moisture had been sucked dry, or rather, it had aged!</p><p>“Leave the range of Heavenly Unravel!”</p><p>Master Siren’s eye twitched, unclear what caused it, but he was already standing and shouting as he rapidly retreated.</p><p>Feng Zhongzui didn’t dare delay and hastened away from the Arena.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou extended his hand, and a drop of Mei Ziyu landed in his palm, aging it instantly before it recovered.</p><p>A soft pattering… The rain gradually intensified, each drop hitting his body felt like a long-lost touch of Yu Lingdi entering the Arena, bringing a sense of familiarity.</p><p>But the power was entirely different.</p><p>“Withering, blooming…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt the dual grandeur of time and life, unflinching.</p><p>He knew that merely a second-grade spiritual sword’s Heavenly Unravel, no matter how strong, couldn’t uplift Gu Yu to this realm.</p><p>There was something else!</p><p>Indeed, after another pause, that seemingly ethereal voice, accompanied by the soft pattering of Mei Ziyu rain, floated down again:</p><p>“The secular world is full of emotion, Flying Cloud serves as support…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyebrows lifted slightly, looking around with a hint of expectation. But after a long wait, only half a phrase managed to squeeze out:</p><p>“Using, the cloud as support!”</p><p>So?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened his mouth, his anticipation growing stronger.</p><p>The Five Domains Spectators also widened their eyes, and after another wait, Elder Gu’s voice finally fell:</p><p>“Secular Sword has emotion.”</p><p>Uh… Xu Xiaoshou smacked his lips, feeling a bit bitter, and his mood also turned somewhat bitter.</p><p>No.</p><p>After waiting so long.</p><p>You thought he was holding back something big, but he ended up dropping a big one?</p><p>What’s all this about? If you truly can’t do it, there’s really no need to put on such a dead act!</p><p>“Uh…” Feng Zhongzui fell silent, unable to produce even a fart after a long while, not daring to comment at all.</p><p>Just then, within the area of thousands of miles covered by Mei Ziyu’s field, a mix of mist and cloud music started to float in response.</p><p>The drifting clouds penetrated the Path Principles, anchored in heaven and earth, sealing off this entire realm completely.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation flashed by.</p><p>Caught within the drifting clouds, Xu Xiaoshou felt a familiar power, the “Ping” force of the emotion sword technique.</p><p>He finally understood, Elder Gu’s words about Heavenly Unravel and the second stage were all meant to mislead him; what he used was the Emotionless Sword Technique · Flying Cloud Token!</p><p>Using Mei Ziyu·Heavenly Unravel as the cue and the Flying Cloud as the base, he placed himself in intangibility and could transform into anything; was he about to construct this world—was he going to use this to lead out the second stage of his major Nine Swords Technique?</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The Power Upanishad Formation flashed again.</p><p>But the aura within wasn’t the Nine Swords Technique, but the Fantasy Sword Technique that Xu Xiaoshou was familiar with…</p><p>The familiar, difficult-to-deliver “Misty Taoist Music” descended from heaven and earth once again, still the very rhythmic, all-encompassing sound wave attack:</p><p>“Flying Cloud…”</p><p>No, not again, “Flying Cloud”? Is that all you have left?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mentality was fairly good, but at this point, he almost couldn’t hold back anymore. He opened his mouth wanting to say something, but then he remembered this was Master Siren’s friend… so he let it be.</p><p>His “Perception” glanced towards Master Siren and found that the old Sword Saint, at some point, had used a fan to cover his face, resorting to the Hidden Sword Technique to minimize his presence—</p><p>—as if he was afraid Feng Zhongzui would grab the Dao Imparting Mirror to ask him what Elder Gu’s second stage words meant.</p><p>“Flying Cloud as the pledge, illusion as the order!”</p><p>Though he didn’t expect it, he did press on the point a little!</p><p>But as the people of the five regions watched with eager anticipation, Elder Gu seemed constipated, emptying himself with two sentences, and then struggled a long time without farting out another word.</p><p>The cold icy rain heavily slapped against his face, and Xu Xiaoshou could no longer hold it in, shouting loudly:</p><p>“Is it so hard to admit you have no talent? Are we going to continue this until next year or what?”</p><p>“Don’t force things when you have nothing, Elder Gu. I’ve waited so long even the Dragon Apricot of the Ancestral Trees has withered!”</p><p>The Void Mist paused, then a voice filled with seething anger rang out:</p><p>“Fantasy Sword Technique, Second World!”</p><p>That was much clearer and smoother.</p><p>With a loud bang, the rain morphed into illusion, forging a vivid picture of mountainous and pastoral scenery all around.</p><p>Is this how the second stage is supposed to be used?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment, as he didn’t see what he had been yearning for within this scenery.</p><p>On the contrary, it looked more like something the old man with limited talent was fond of.</p><p>But soon, Xu Xiaoshou caught on to a clue…</p><p>Encircling the scenery of this misty and rainy Jiangnan, there stood nine ethereal swords reaching for the sky!</p><p>“Nine Limit Skill… Flying Cloud…”</p><p>Still Flying Cloud?</p><p>Are you sick?</p><p>“If it’s Infinite Number then say Infinite Number, if it’s Nine Swords Technique then say Nine Swords Technique. What limit is Nine Limit, what cloud is Flying Cloud?” Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t listen to a single word anymore, “Hurry it up!”</p><p>The pastoral scenery shook again, followed by a voice frustrated and red-faced with anger:</p><p>“Three Realms Unity, Unity Extreme Sword!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
