I didn’t shoot anything?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stumbled, turned around and glared at the big oaf, “I wasn’t talking to you!”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>“If I disappear later, whatever you hear me shout last, you just follow and shout the same, get it?”</p><p>“Sure thing, Brother Shou.”</p><p>Having given instructions, Xu Xiaoshou no longer paid attention to Cao Erzhu, he flicked his sleeve and with hands clasped behind his back, he stepped upwards as if taking the easy way out.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>At the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, in front of the protective great array, a brilliant Space Power Upanishad Formation suddenly unfolded.</p><p>That formation was so immense it seemed to cover the inverted mountain itself with its radiance.</p><p>This time, it wasn’t just the Eyes of the Great Path that could see it—all eyes were on it.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“Saint Servant, no, the First Pavilion in the Sky’s Lord Shou!”</p><p>“He he he… He has finally come to ascend the sacred mountain!”</p><p>At Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, from base to middle to peak, countless people craned their necks in anticipation, from the lowly mountain guardians to the demi-saints of the Council of Ten; every face was a picture of shock.</p><p>After many days, everyone already knew about Lord Shou’s bold proclamation when he had set foot on Yu Lingdi.</p><p>The city had not been destroyed, but was even more bleakly emptied.</p><p>His grand assertion was half fulfilled!</p><p>Some guessed that Lord Shou would stop here; even he must have a limit, after all, Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe was the place that came closest to the “Stairway to Heaven” on this earth.</p><p>Others said that during the era of Sky City, Lord Shou had already collided head-on with the Holy Emperor, and outside the Four Symbols Secret Realm, he even tore apart the Holy Emperor Qilin with his bare hands; he already Feared no one.</p><p>And now, as the Spatial Upanishad bloomed at the peak of the sacred mountain…</p><p>Everyone breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>It wasn’t ease.</p><p>But acceptance.</p><p>He’s come!</p><p>Finally, no more anxiety!</p><p>…</p><p>“Hurry, hurry, hurry!”</p><p>“Lord Shou has taken on the sacred mountain, let’s rush over to see!”</p><p>“Those who can perform Blood Escape, do so; those who can’t, well, you’re just too late, haha…”</p><p>Those who previously gathered around Jade Capital City, involved in Elder Zhong’s lecture and many others who came to witness the battle after seeing the Dao Imparting Mirror, now trailed Cao Erzhu’s footsteps towards the sacred mountain.</p><p>“Brothers, I’m loyal, right?”</p><p>Far away, Feng Zhongzui was holding the Dao Imparting Mirror and taking selfies with it—he still hadn’t left!</p><p>“I know you all have had your complaints about me.”</p><p>“Actually, this was my first time using the Dao Imparting Mirror, so it’s normal for my hands to be a little shaky; please don’t curse me.”</p><p>“Now it’s different, the times have changed and so have I! The old family head of my family, and the Feng family members, all left earlier, but I didn’t run. Why?”</p><p>“Because I know what you all really want to see…”</p><p>Having finished speaking calmly, Feng Zhongzui turned the mirror in another direction and screamed passionately:</p><p>“The Number One Sword Deity, Lord Shou!!”</p><p>Just as everyone was about to go home, stunned by the outburst that almost made their ears ring, they saw in the mirror’s reflection the outline of the Space Power Upanishad Formation that was spectacularly displayed outside the Inverted Mountain.</p><p>In that moment, all those who were about to head home stopped in their tracks and scrambled for a good view.</p><p>“Dammit!”</p><p>“Feng Zhongzui, you’re a real man; you’ve got guts!”</p><p>“Good, good, good, Feng Zhongzui charges ahead, and brothers, we will back you up!”</p><p>“Digging is fine, just for this move, in the future, I’ve got to invite you to Feng Family City for a drink!”</p><p>As Feng Tingchen passed by a Dao Imparting Mirror, he discovered that even though the battle between Sword Immortals had ended, these people still hadn’t left.</p><p>On the contrary, they were even more frenzied.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Feng Tingchen was just about to reach the southernmost part of the Central Region and couldn’t help but move closer.</p><p>Without even seeing the image, he heard Feng Zhongzui’s voice, hoarse from days of shouting, yet still filled with fiery passion:</p><p>“Remember the time!”</p><p>“The battle between Sword Deity Hua and the Eighth Sword Immortal was called ‘the greatest battle under heaven’!”</p><p>“Yet, the process was unknown to all, and the outcome also held its mysteries, becoming ‘the greatest regret under heaven’… Why?”</p><p>“Because at that time, I, Feng Zhongzui, hadn’t been born yet! I didn’t have the Dao Imparting Mirror! But now it’s different, the times are different!”</p><p>No, how could he say anything like that?</p><p>Feng Tingchen listened dumbfoundedly, struggling to keep up with the pace of the young people nowadays, when he heard a hysterical shout:</p><p>“Without me, Feng Zhongzui, imparting the dao would be like eternal night!”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
