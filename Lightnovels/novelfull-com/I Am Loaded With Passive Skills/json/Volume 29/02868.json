What should your punishment be!”</p><p>With a loud boom, the black and red power of the evil sin surged out from the bow like electricity, silencing the Saint Hall. You could hear a pin drop.</p><p>Several young people were terrified, keeping their heads down, not daring to look more.</p><p>It’s over…</p><p>The bubble has burst…</p><p>Updated by ℕovG○.co</p><p>Elder Yu gazed at Hallmaster Xuanji’s face, dark as charcoal, and after sighing, spoke, “If I may say…”</p><p>“Shut up!” The Evil Sin Bow turned.</p><p>Elder Yu jumped as if burnt and then crouched down, holding his head, “I’m not speaking, not speaking.”</p><p>“Love…”</p><p>The Ninth Divine Priest was cut off mid-sentence by the Arrow of Evil Sin Bow aiming at her, and she opened her mouth.</p><p>Lord Ai Cangsheng shifted his jaw to the side.</p><p>The Ninth Divine Priest could only hide in a corner and pleaded bitterly, “Don’t start fighting…”</p><p>“Hallmaster Xuanji.”</p><p>The arrow aimed at its true target, and Lord Ai Cangsheng’s expression returned to calm, “Give me a reason to put down the Evil Sin Bow.”</p><p>Updated by NovG○.co</p><p>That indifferent response echoed endlessly within the hall.</p><p>Xi’s heart jumped with terror, recalling her first encounter with The Divine and the vision brought up by that man.</p><p>Would Lord Cang Sheng really dare?</p><p>The Ten High Nobles, not a single coward among them?</p><p>That’s Hallmaster Xuanji herself, and her surname is Dao. Not giving any face, just forcibly confronting?</p><p>Hallmaster Xuanji swallowed, Lord Ai Cangsheng’s killing intent seemed all too real, she struggled to sound calm:</p><p>“Currently, I am the hallmaster. Is that reason enough?”</p><p>“It’s not enough.” Lord Ai Cangsheng’s eyelids drooped, his eyes gray and dull.</p><p>Hallmaster Xuanji took a deep breath, glancing towards Beibei.</p><p>In that moment, Beibei felt doomed!</p><p>Could it be, Hallmaster Xuanji wouldn’t sell me out, would she?</p><p>Back then, I also dared not accept that bet, it was your voice that tempted me to agree!</p><p>Beibei even thought about coming out from behind the pillar, but didn’t dare. Compared to Hallmaster Xuanji, Lord Cang Sheng at this moment was far more terrifying!</p><p>Hallmaster Xuanji, however, would not shift the blame onto the young people, she quickly withdrew her gaze, staring back at the Arrow of the Evil Sin Bow.</p><p>Suddenly, she relaxed completely and smiled in relief.</p><p>Would Lord Ai Cangsheng really dare to release that arrow?!</p><p>“Setting right and wrong aside, I hold the position of hallmaster. Under the Stairway to Heaven, I am to be revered.”</p><p>“With the current urgent situation, and you being part of the Holy Divine Palace and a member of the Council of Ten, we should unify against external forces first, and not act impulsively.”</p><p>“So, put down the bow!”</p><p>Hallmaster Xuanji was firm!</p><p>These words almost blatantly said that although the three emperors might carry great authority and high ranks, just below one is always another, their position remains lower than a hallmaster, and they must obey!</p><p>After hearing this, Elder Yu stared dumbfoundedly at this newly appointed emperor, recently appointed as hallmaster, not yet familiar with her subordinate’s temperament…</p><p>He sensed trouble brewing, quickly shedding his playful demeanor, and seriously intended to speak.</p><p>“Elder Yu, step back.”</p><p>Lord Ai Cangsheng stared at Hallmaster Xuanji, without turning his head, he also laughed.</p><p>In that moment, everyone in the great hall was unsure if his commands were out of respect or an order.</p><p>Elder Yu panicked.</p><p>When Lord Ai Cangsheng told him to “shut up,” he could shut up.</p><p>But when this fellow suddenly switched to honorifics, he didn’t dare “step back” at all, even going so far as to move forward, trying to shield Hallmaster Xuanji…</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The dome of the Saint Hall suddenly shattered.</p><p>At the top of Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, like a volcanic eruption, a surge of black and red evil sin energy erupted into the sky.</p><p>“Hum.”</p><p>The great array activated.</p><p>In an instant, it swallowed up the force that was about to become rampant.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“The energy of the sinful sins, has Lord Cangsheng returned?”</p><p>The guardians of the mountain saw the phenomenon at the mountain peak, all exclaiming with joy, “This is great, the situation at the foot of the mountain is now stable!”</p><p>…</p><p>Silence!</p><p>Complete silence!</p><p>Deathly silence!</p><p>In the Saint Hall where the dome had shattered, it wasn’t just the floor and columns that suffered. The Divine Array completely collapsed, exposing the dangerously cracked walls.</p><p>Elder Yu looked at the arrow shot into the floor, just half a step away from him, which eventually turned into the black and red power of the evil sin and disappeared, and his body shivered sharply.</p><p>“What a tragedy…” he sighed, touching his forehead, then stepped back.</p><p>The Ninth Divine Priest furrowed her brows tightly, her hand gripping her skirt, twisted it around her finger into a knot, and nervously murmured, “Don’t fight…”</p><p>But with an arrow already released, how was there room for mediation?</p><p>Hallmaster Xuanji’s body shook violently, unable to believe as she stared at the arrow transforming into energy and stepped forward abruptly, calling out:</p><p>“Lord Ai Cangsheng! Are you rebelling against the heavens?!”</p><p>“With such an enemy present, within the Saint Hall, you dare attack Elder Yu?!”</p><p>It wasn’t him, he didn’t, don’t speak nonsense… Elder Yu almost jumped up to argue, but after opening his mouth, he could only release a bubble of air, not daring to speak a second word.</p><p>Hallmaster Xuanji did not walk two steps before the Evil Sin Bow was drawn again, and she was once more stopped by the sharp arrow’s point, halting her steps and words.</p><p>“From the beginning, I did not wish to communicate with you all…”</p><p>Lord Ai Cangsheng muttered to himself with a hoarse voice, his indifferent eyes melted away the last bit of irritation, leaving them still and lifeless.</p><p>He wished Hallmaster Dao could now jump out from the outside, chuckle twice and say:</p><p>“Just a joke.”</p><p>It probably wasn’t.</p><p>It just needed to be more talkative with this group of people whose minds simply couldn’t turn.</p><p>He still held the Evil Sin Bow fully drawn, impolitely aiming at Hallmaster Xuanji’s head, his eyes empty.</p><p>He no longer asked, just talked to himself, as if telling a story:</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao tricked me into the God Executioner’s Ruins… well, now it’s fine to directly say the Ran Ming ruins, I’ve been through it once, there won’t be a second chance.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
