I thought you said it was possible… but I did mention I would be offensive just now, so there’s no need to apologize, right?”</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>…</p><p>The snowstorm raged, and the sword energy ran rampant.</p><p>“Ancient Sword Steps?”</p><p>“Fifty-four Sword Steps?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had only just heard Feng Zhongzui briefing the onlookers in front of the Dao Imparting Mirror on the knowledge of “sword technique”.</p><p>The traceless transparent sword light had already flashed from an unknown location in the snowstorm, sweeping fiercely over his body.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points +9999.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou remained unmoved, but the clothes on his chest exploded into pieces.</p><p>His body, as cold and luminous as jade emitting a rosy glow, had been slashed in an instant, as if tormented by ten thousand swords—a massive wound dense with numerous minor cuts!</p><p>“One sword, breached my defenses?”</p><p>Even though the wounds could heal in an instant, Xu Xiaoshou was alarmed.</p><p>With each consecutive attack of the Fifty-four Sword Steps being stronger than the last, this initial sword could penetrate the defenses of a holy emperor-level Strengthen…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to be negligent, “Perception” bloomed mightily as he searched for Li Fuyu’s whereabouts.</p><p>But…</p><p>No trace!</p><p>She seemed to also know the Vanishing Technique, leaving no trace in this world after striking with a sword.</p><p>“Merging with the Way of the Heavens?”</p><p>“Merging with the Way of the Sword?”</p><p>“Merging with the Way of Nothingness?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind flashed with many possibilities, trying and verifying each one, but he still couldn’t find any trace of Li Fuyu among these various paths and methods.</p><p>Swish! Swish!</p><p>Once again, the traceless sword light swept out, this time piercing from both west and east directions simultaneously.</p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points +9999.”</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points +9999.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s body trembled, he did not move, yet the flesh on his chest turned hazy with blood—this second strike could harm the meridians, and its power surged considerably!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s back chilled, he dared not take it lightly, and drew the Flame Python, slashing with his sword.</p><p>“Falling Flower World!”</p><p>In the midst of the snowstorm, Red Plum petals fluttered down.</p><p>He attempted to find the Formless Li Fuyu with the Swordless Sword Technique by switching between the illusion and reality, nothingness and existence.</p><p>——Still no trace!</p><p>Moved in his heart, Xu Xiaoshou who had “Perception” bloom grandly, could detect faint fluctuating traces of existence and nothingness in the void for a split second…</p><p>Was Li Fuyu transitioning from non-existence to existence at the same moment he turned into nothingness?</p><p>Or rather, did she slice out from “nothingness” that could possibly be a form of consciousness, entering another state of “nothingness” unknown to him?</p><p>“Blocked my vision?” Xu Xiaoshou grew angry.</p><p>This was not just Sword Steps but an advanced Shadow Concealing Step.</p><p>She was clearly right by his side, yet blocking his line of sight, vanishing from existence from an alternative angle of “Path” and “Nothingness”…</p><p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p><p>Before he could think further, the traceless sword light again advanced upon him.</p><p>This time, converging from above, below left, and below right simultaneously, as if there were three Li Fuyus attacking… no, launching a covert attack!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not find her, but he could catch the rhythm of the attacks, predicting his strikes:</p><p>“Way of Nothingness, Swordless Sword Form.”</p><p>“Mo’s Way, Green River Sword Borderline.”</p><p>The two swords burst forth nearly at the same time, melding together, forming a domain of sword light similar to the Close-bounds Force Field.</p><p>“No Sword Realm!”</p><p>He drew a sword straight in front of his chest.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s form faded along with the sword.</p><p>At the same time, around his body, the Mo Sword appeared out of nowhere, then transformed into void, turning into countless entities resembling the Glow of Sharpness, madly interweaving to protect a space of one zhang around him.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Blood blossomed before his legs.</p><p>Then, a large chunk of flesh and blood flew from his chest, this time reaching as deep as his ribs and heart.</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points +9999.”</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points +9999.”</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points +9999.”</p><p>He had parried nothing…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s sword parried air, and even his complexion shook.</p><p>Just by the lack of touch, just by that feeling of not having made contact with anything, he knew the defense of the No Sword Realm around him had failed.</p><p>Li Fuyu’s third strike of the Sword Steps disregarded the No Sword Realm!</p><p>Was she in another, higher plane of “Nothingness”?</p><p>What was this “Nothing”?</p><p>“Received Concern, Passive Points +2.”</p><p>“Received Understanding, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui clutched the Dao Imparting Mirror, staring intently at the Arena, so focused that he didn’t notice even when the mirror tilted, he just screamed:</p><p>“The first strike, the second strike…”</p><p>“It’s the Fourth Sword! It can’t be blocked, it simply can’t be blocked!”</p><p>“Li Fuyu’s Ancient Sword Steps, Lord Shou has never seen them before. In fact, not just him, I haven’t seen them either, and let me show you their expressions… they haven’t seen them either!”</p><p>The Dao Imparting Mirror straightened, and below it, a smaller view appeared, showing old Sword Immortals such as Mei Siren and Feng Tingchen.</p><p>Without exception, each of them wore a look of astonishment.</p><p>Even Mei Siren had stopped moving the fan in his hands, staring intently at the Arena and those traceless sword lights, trying to decipher something…</p><p>Boom boom boom boom!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s front and back, arms and ribs were all ripped open, the wounds so deep that bones were visible.</p><p>This time, he employed the Fantasy Sword Technique, leaving behind an illusion, while his true body used the Time-space Transition, vanishing into nothingness for a moment.</p><p>There was no Vanishing Technique, no Independence.</p><p>The Ancient Sword Technique encompassed a myriad of defenses, capable of impersonating invincibility, right?</p><p>The result…</p><p>Completely ineffective!</p><p>Li Fuyu saw through it as if it were crystal clear.</p><p>Such tricks and the Fantasy Sword Technique were child’s play before her, and the Time-space Transition had mistimed the rhythm.</p><p>With the Fifty-four Sword Steps, Li Fuyu could slow down a bit, waiting for Xu Xiaoshou’s Time-space Transition to revert to reality… then strike again!</p><p>“Can’t figure it out!”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui, seeing Master Siren’s solemn expression, knew everything:</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
