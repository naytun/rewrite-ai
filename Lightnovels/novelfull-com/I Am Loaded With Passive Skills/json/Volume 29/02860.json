Then, it explosively shattered into endless showers of sword rain, pouring down furiously.</p><p>The raindrops, promoting decay and flourishing, pierced through the air, dissolved muscles and disintegrated bones, and after shooting through the Ultimate Giant, left him riddled like a sieve.</p><p>The Mystical Gate abruptly shook as if a super-sized Great Sword, charged with the power of ages, shot out from within a scabbard.</p><p>Even before Xu Xiaoshou could react, the Unity Extreme Sword, as large as the Ultimate Giant’s head, had already pierced through his chest!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The screen of the Dao Imparting Mirror went black.</p><p>.com</p><p>Five Domains Spectators, who had nearly put their heads into the mirror to perceive the Sword Will, suddenly faced trouble and were so furious they almost split apart.</p><p>“What the heck!”</p><p>“Damn, look, let me see!”</p><p>“Damn Dao Imparting Mirror, damn Feng Zhongzui… did you just black out the mirror at the critical moment, is this the generosity of your Feng family? Talking about imparting the Dao, yet not letting us see?!”</p><p>“Useless, useless, useless, I knew I should have sent myself to the Central Region, arrgh I shouldn’t have bet, I want to be at the scene!”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui, stunned, heard a “crack” sound beside his ear, but he couldn’t shift his gaze away from the frontline battlefield.</p><p>But on the site of the old Jade Capital City…</p><p>The Ultimate Giant, violently exploded!</p><p>A Great Sword of light descended from the sky, pierced through him, submerged him, and fiercely plunged into the earth, shocking and astonishing!</p><p>That place… If Lord Shou hadn’t taken away Jade Capital City, wouldn’t the entire city have been bombed into dust by now?</p><p>Yet in a fleeting moment of hesitation, Feng Zhongzui blinked and saw that Lord Shou had not moved previously, nor had he transformed into a giant.</p><p>The Great Sword of light that descended from the sky, originating from the Mystical, had never actually entered the battle or pierced towards the earth.</p><p>It was all an illusion!</p><p>The Mystical had never descended!</p><p>“Thud.”</p><p>Dust and dirt splashed up from the earth.</p><p>Among countless curses, the image on the Dao Imparting Mirror returned, showing Gu Yu collapsed on the ground, his hair disheveled, barely clinging to life.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“Elder Gu… wasn’t he just deploying a sword technique, how did it end again?”</p><p>“Damn you, Feng Zhongzui, is this how you impart the Dao, huh? You’d better not let me find you in person, or I’ll get you!”</p><p>Again, curses filled the air.</p><p>Everyone stared at the image in the mirror, wanting to swipe away the black lines before their eyes, only to realize that the black lines emanating were not their own issue.</p><p>Just like at the beginning of the first battle of the Sword Deity, the image transmitted by the Dao Imparting Mirror had a fine black line in the middle.</p><p>Had this treasure been damaged before?</p><p>Even the grand power of the Feng family in the Southern Region couldn’t fix it.</p><p>“The rain continues to drizzle down…”</p><p>The earth was muddy from the rain.</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou broke out in a cold sweat, and upon regaining his composure to look at the image before him, noticed that the Mystical Gate was already closed without his knowledge.</p><p>Gu Yu had also returned from the illusion of the “Secular Sword” and ended his “Divine Transformation” state…</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>Did he just strike me with a sword just then?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his memory was somewhat blurry; he seemed to have deployed the Raging Giant to block, or perhaps not?</p><p>Checking his energy reserve, it was depleted.</p><p>In fact, he no longer had what is called an energy reserve, and even the various Holy Powers and spiritual sources that pervaded his body were all completely exhausted.</p><p>These signs clearly indicated that he had just gone through an extremely brutal battle, but…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also found it difficult to recall the process in the middle!</p><p>“What the heck?”</p><p>He didn’t want to fight anymore.</p><p>He flashed to Elder Gu’s side.</p><p>But by that time, there was already someone else beside Gu Yu.</p><p>His upper body was propped up, his tangled white hair was dry and curled without any luster, his face pale as paper, and densely wrinkled.</p><p>Mei Siren’s ever-present paper fan, for reasons unknown, was discarded on the ground.</p><p>With his left arm, he embraced his old friend, and with his right, he wrapped around the icy body, trying to impart some warmth while constantly patting Gu Yu’s back and sighing,</p><p>“Why bother? It’s just like watching the moon’s reflection in water, a great dream all the same.”</p><p>Gu Yu was exhaling more than he was inhaling, but at the sound, he sharply inhaled, choked, and while coughing severely, seemed to be laughing:</p><p>“Heh, ha…”</p><p>“Mei Siren, you saw, didn’t you…”</p><p>Mei Siren closed his eyes, struggled to recall, but his mind was a blank.</p><p>He held his friend even closer, resting his head beside his ear, letting the rain drift down from the sky over his cheeks, and spoke with a light laugh,</p><p>“Not just saw, I also remembered, I have remembered.”</p><p>Gu Yu’s body stiffened, a smile appeared on his face, then he lost all movements and sounds.</p><p>Mei Siren himself stiffened, grief transforming into tears welling in his eyes.</p><p>At that moment, the person in his arms convulsed, “hissed” as he choked on a turbid breath, and again initiated a series of heavy coughs:</p><p>“Mei Siren, then you… impressive…”</p><p>“I… anyway, I… don’t remember… anything…”</p><p>Mei Siren took a deep breath, then refrained from responding.</p><p>Just as he was about to speak, Gu Yu struggled within his embrace, laboriously lifting his hand, gesturing toward Feng Zhongzui.</p><p>“Child, come here.”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui’s eyes were already filled with tears, not bearing to aim the Dao Imparting Mirror at Elder Gu anymore, now he couldn’t help but get a bit closer.</p><p>“Right… I…”</p><p>He could only move the Dao Imparting Mirror again, broadcasting the desolate and crestfallen appearance of the Number One Sword Deity to the world.</p><p>Gu Yu seemed not to care at all, having done all this, he wanted to turn his body but had no strength left, could only quietly watch the rain.</p><p>“Mei Siren, under the Mystical Gate… I have realized… a poem…”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I said! I realized… a line of poetry! Cough cough…”</p><p>“Stop messing around,” Mei Siren resisted the urge to slap him, “You village bumpkin, what do you know about poetry and verse? Others might not know you, but don’t I know you? Planting melons and tending fields are indeed your strength, but poetry?”</p><p>Glancing once more at the Dao Imparting Mirror behind him, Mei Siren refrained again, “Perhaps it’s somewhat of a talent.”</p><p>Gu Yu, with a hoarse voice, coughed and laughed, and after a long while, managed to speak again.</p><p>“Mei Siren…”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“I said… give it… a review…”</p><p>“Ah, sure.”</p><p>Gu Yu then extended his hand toward the sky, letting the unfeeling rain, now devoid of its vitality, flow down his arm from his palm.</p><p>But there was no sensation.</p><p>He didn’t care and as if seeing the Mystical again, his aged eyes brightened, filled with emotion as he raised his voice,</p><p>“Picking chrysanthemums beneath the Eastern fence, leisurely! The South Mountain in plain sight…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou struggled to smile, his lips curling slightly.</p><p>Mei Siren knew immediately that this was plagiarized, though he didn’t know whose work had been borrowed, but still he praised,</p><p>“Good poem! Good lines! It seems that all these years of seclusion weren’t entirely…”</p><p>“Mei Siren!” The person in his arms convulsed heavily again, interrupting him.</p><p>Mei Siren lowered his head, “What now?”</p><p>Gu Yu’s gaze became fixed, staring dumbly through his fingers at the fragmented sky, at that Path which remained elusive unto this moment.</p><p>He stared for a long time, finally seeing a light descending from the Mystical Gate after the clouds had cleared…</p><p>Light?</p><p>There was light again?</p><p>It seemed like it wanted to guide him anew.</p><p>Gu Yu’s face hence gained a bit more luster.</p><p>But in the end, the light vanished and he found his mind was still as empty as ever, unable to be penetrated by light, as if the Mystical had never descended.</p><p>Gu Yu became lost in thought, using all his strength to grasp at the void, catching nothing.</p><p>It was all just an illusion!</p><p>His hand had already smashed into the ground, twisting into an odd position, even the hot inquiry within his throat could not be voiced.</p><p>“Mei Siren, Mei Ziyu, it’s stopped…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
