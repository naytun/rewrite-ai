Possible?”</p><p>At this moment, his mind recalled the words once said by the family head and a group of kids when he first learned Mo Sword Technique:</p><p>What is Mo Sword Technique?</p><p>First, you have to condense a Mo Sword.</p><p>So, what is Mo Sword? Or what is “Mo”?</p><p>Mo means true.</p><p>Mo Sword Technique, also known as True Sword Technique in ancient times.</p><p>To form a Mo Sword, first condense it with Sword Will, transforming one’s energy into a semi-void and semi-substantial state, only then can it achieve ignoring defense and causing true damage.</p><p>“Sword Will, energy…”</p><p>These two major factors emerged in Feng Zhongzui’s mind, and he reflected on Lord Shou’s actions:</p><p>“Did he use sword cognition, a higher level than Sword Will, to condense the Mo Sword?”</p><p>“He did not use his own energy, but instead took advantage of the uncontrolled soul energy of the Fengdu Sword, instantly transforming it into his own?”</p><p>Even as he spoke, Feng Zhongzui himself could hardly believe it.</p><p>Because, although theoretically possible, actually applying it in combat would be incredibly difficult.</p><p>Capturing the opponent’s fleeting weakness during battle and turning their sword into one’s own use, what kind of audacious genius would think of that move, and what boldness is required to execute it?</p><p>“Could it be, my understanding is incorrect?”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui looked towards the Old Sword Immortal, Master Siren, etc., but saw that these old Sword Immortals and Sword Saints were just as shocked as he was.</p><p>Until Mei Siren, shocked, turned his gaze towards the Dao Imparting Mirror and nodded slightly.</p><p>“Am I right?”</p><p>The moment Feng Zhongzui felt a surge of heat emanate from the soles of his feet right up to the top of his head, uncontrollable, he yelled:</p><p>“What is called Spirits Controlling Trickery? Your spiritual power, too, can be used by me!”</p><p>“What is called Mo Sword Technique? The vast Fengdu Sword, someday, also has to submit under my Hidden Bitter Sword!”</p><p>“This is Lord Shou—”</p><p>The shrill scream from outside the Arena completely failed to reach Li Fuyu’s ears.</p><p>She just stared blankly at the figure commanding the sword with his back towards her, feeling as though her brain had been hammered and couldn’t react for a while.</p><p>How did he do it?</p><p>Not knowing the true face of Mount Lu, only because one is right in the midst of it.</p><p>Li Fuyu temporarily couldn’t get the answer.</p><p>And by that time, the Fengdu Sword was already pointing directly at her head, leaving her no choice but to abandon further attempts to regain control over the sword and to turn elsewhere.</p><p>—Her own body was exhausted by now; she couldn’t instantly condense another sword capable of matching the Fengdu Sword. After all, not everyone is Xu Xiaoshou, with an inexhaustible stamina.</p><p>“Defend!”</p><p>A loud shout.</p><p>In a critical moment, Li Fuyu, concerned only with saving her life, no longer cared about the rules set before the fight and called out her sword.</p><p>Hum!</p><p>The saber, positioned on the edge of the Arena, responded by breaking through space, coming faster despite being later, and landed in Li Fuyu’s hand.</p><p>“Spacetime Transition!” Feng Zhongzui excitedly jumped:</p><p>“Broken! The rules are broken!”</p><p>“Li Fuyu picked up her sword, she has used the first realm of Fantasy Sword Technique!”</p><p>Stateless Li Fuyu’s soul body was as rootless as duckweed, immensely void.</p><p>Once the saber was in hand, her soul body solidified, and the human-like aura completely disappeared, as if she fully merged with the sword in her hand.</p><p>When the Fengdu Sword stabbed at her, she held the scabbard with her left hand and the hilt with her right, then resoundingly drew the sword.</p><p>“Unsheathing Sword.”</p><p>As masters of the Plane, a single person’s power could suppress a whole Plane, control the Origin, and guard the heavens and the earth.</p><p>Upon reaching the Dominion Realm, a cultivator’s cultivation abilities merged with their own Qiankun Heaven and Earth, making a person one with the heavens and earth.</p><p>That section of Qiankun Heaven and Earth also aligned with the Plane they resided in, sharing a mutual connection with the Origin.</p><p>When such a powerful being took action, every move they made was enhanced by the power of a Plane.</p><p>Without reaching Dominion, one cannot comprehend the grandeur of the Dominion Realm’s power.</p><p>“That is, the Dominion Realm!”</p><p>With their bodies locked in place and their souls trembling, the strong warriors from the Giant Origin Clan widened their eyes and exclaimed in a low voice.</p><p>One by one, the military formations of the Giant Origin Clan collapsed, and the gathered combat strength could not be manifested at all.</p><p>Fortunately, the same was true for the opposing Void Spirit Clan, whose combat strength was completely stripped away.</p><p>On the contrary, as Li Fuyu gave up control over the Fengdu Sword, the large amount of soul power he had just absorbed back into his body surged back.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
