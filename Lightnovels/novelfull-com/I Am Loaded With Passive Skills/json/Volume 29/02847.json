Can he keep up with the times?”</p><p>Pfft… Gu Yu almost burst out in blood from Feng Zhongzui’s heart-piercing words, but the attack with sword cognition truly could not be taken lightly.</p><p>“Heavenly Phenomenon!”</p><p>Without hesitation, the seasons evolved around Gu Yu, finally merging Yin and Yang, clarifying the murky, and visualizing into the form of chaos…</p><p>“Tap.”</p><p>At the same moment, the sound of a spiritual sword being sheathed came from behind.</p><p>Before Gu Yu’s “Heavenly Chaos” could strike, he was astonished to find that Xu Xiaoshou’s silhouette in front of him had dissipated.</p><p>He turned his eyes in stunned silence, looking towards the rear.</p><p>Feng Zhongzui, unable to keep up with the reaction speed, only managed to turn the Dao Imparting Mirror at that moment, following the turn to find Lord Shou who had, at some unknown time, appeared behind Elder Gu.</p><p>Lord Shou’s Hidden Bitter was sheathed.</p><p>The Heavenly Phenomenon of chaos behind also returned to the scabbard.</p><p>Dressed in black, he slightly lifted his chin, and with a touch of melancholy in his eyes, he slowly stretched out his hand, catching a snowflake falling from the sky, then gently blew it away, leaving the Dao Imparting Mirror with a perfect profile, and said faintly,</p><p>“This sword is called ‘Withering Snow of the West Wind.’</p><p>What does that mean?</p><p>Everyone looked on in discomfort, worse than accidentally swallowing flies when laughing, at Lord Shou, who suddenly started sheathing his sword and getting ready.</p><p>What are you doing? Elder Gu hasn’t made his strike yet, and you’re still fighting, are you ill to suddenly do this!</p><p>However, Feng Zhongzui was the first to recover, his expression changing dramatically as he said,</p><p>“Wait, am I seeing things, or did Lord Shou also display a ‘Heavenly Phenomenon’ just now?”</p><p>This outcry, like rolling thunder, instantly awakened everyone, jolting Gu Yu into alertness.</p><p>But he hadn’t even moved when… with a jolt of his waist…</p><p>“Whish whoosh!”</p><p>His upper garments fell apart, and rings of dazzling sword light swept out from his neck, chest, and waist.</p><p>Blood sprayed as his head tilted; clearly, Gu Yu saw his sword arm, along with his other arm, flying out with the sword light.</p><p>The sword light evolved with the power of four seasons, merged Yin and Yang, and turned into Chaotic Mist after leaving the body, dissipating.</p><p>— It was clearly the ultimate move of the Planting Eight Swords, Heavenly Chaos, which he had not managed to unleash before the final moment!</p><p>“I’m hit?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
