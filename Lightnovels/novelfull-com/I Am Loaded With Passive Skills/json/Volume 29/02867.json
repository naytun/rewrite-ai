How was that different from standing naked and exposed before the world?</p><p>One careless move could lead directly to a sudden death!</p><p>Dao Xuanji dared not speak further, fearful that Ai Cangsheng would tremble with irritation.</p><p>She raised her hands above her head to show that she had no threats or intent of resistance, while her eyes slanted towards Elder Yu.</p><p>“Calm down! Calm down!”</p><p>Elder Yu jumped up from his seat, no longer daring to watch from the sidelines.</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s glance was like she wanted to flay him alive, and further observation would likely lead to retribution after the fact.</p><p>“Surely, I couldn’t be Little Dao in disguise, right? You can believe me, right?” Elder Yu chuckled, pulling out his signature fishing rod and twisting his toes as he rolled up the cuffs of his pants.</p><p>“Yes, Ai Cangsheng, I, too, can vouch that she is not Dao Qiongcang,” the Ninth Divine Priest finally found an opportunity to insert a word, lifting his foot as he spoke… and putting it back in its original place.</p><p>To quench a fire is one thing.</p><p>When the Evil Sin Bow was drawn full-circle, Elder Yu had no desire to step forward as a shield, nor did the Ninth Divine Priest dare to come any closer.</p><p>The one closest to Ai Cangsheng was still a pile of rotting flesh beside the wheelchair.</p><p>The rot squirmed slightly, an eyeball within glancing upwards, not daring even to groan, knowingly ceasing all minor movements.</p><p>The Saint Hall was deathly quiet; those on the ground crouched, and those on the walls stayed put, their hearts pounding like heavy drums, daring not to make the slightest motion.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng glanced at Elder Yu, and the Evil Sin Bow slightly relaxed.</p><p>“Huh…”</p><p>Dao Xuanji exhaled softly, her hands just beginning to lower.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>A ripple passed through the space.</p><p>The Evil Sin Bow, which seemed to be lowering, was instead pulled even tighter!</p><p>“Calm down! Calm down!”</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s hands were once again raised by an intangible force, and Elder Yu reeled backward with a tingling scalp.</p><p>He dared not babble any longer, his robe billowing as Holy Power surged within him.</p><p>“Woo—”</p><p>Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe fell into darkness at its peak.</p><p>The song of the Kun echoed from south to north, as if an invisible giant beast passed over the Saint Hall, kicking up stones and dust.</p><p>When the pressure had passed and the waves stilled, Elder Yu patted his chest, affirming with conviction, “First off, I am the Kun Peng God, I am Elder Yu, you must believe this, because Little Dao can’t mimic me.”</p><p>Then he looked towards Dao Xuanji, “And I can vouch for her, she was indeed not fibbing just now… but if you still don’t believe it, then I shall not vouch at all.”</p><p>On a summer afternoon, Liu Sisi was leaning against the tree roots by the back wall, staring blankly at the sky above her head, still unable to recover from the current situation.</p><p>A few married women passing by the Di Family’s courtyard looked at her from a distance and whispered to each other.</p><p>“Do you think the Di family’s new bride is not right? Her gaze is so straight, and she looks so foolish. Could it be because a high fever turned her into an idiot?”</p><p>“Don’t you know, this new wife of Di Yelei isn’t like any ordinary person. I heard that she had something going on with Businessman Zhang from the city… Anyway, she failed to escape marriage and jumped into the river on her wedding night. She ended up like this because of the cold she caught while having a high fever.”</p><p>“If you ask me, what’s the use of keeping such a shameless daughter-in-law? Better just tie her up and sell her to the brothel to save on medical expenses.”</p><p>“Di Yelei is pretty good actually. If it weren’t for his two children, he wouldn’t have married this disaster of a woman back home…”</p><p>The chirping in her ears made Liu Sisi gently close her eyes.</p><p>She had heard similar gossip over the past few days, but she simply did not pay attention to them!</p><p>Others thought she had caught a cold from escaping marriage and falling into the water, staying sick for several days. However, only she knew that she had changed her core by now, and she was no longer the same person.</p><p>The original her was just an orphan whose parents had died, grew up with her grandpa in their rural hometown. When she got her first month’s salary after graduating from college, she bought a bottle of red wine to celebrate, but after getting drunk, she woke up as this Liu Sisi, who had attempted to escape her wedding and drowned in an accident.</p><p>The gossip from a few married women suddenly woke up her idle thoughts, and she realized that she had forgotten about the big problem waiting for her!</p><p>A hurried footsteps were heard, and soon, a big man appeared before her eyes.</p><p>Di Yelei had just come back from the old house, and with a belly full of idle anger, he felt suffocated and irritable when he thought about his sickly wife lying in bed.</p><p>His biological mother passed away as soon as he was born, and tragedy struck his betrothed wife before their marriage. Years later, he finally found a new wife. Just when their lives were starting to improve, she had a fall and died, leaving him with two children and a mountain of debt.</p><p>Initially, Aunt Zhang had persuaded him, thinking about his young children, and hearing the matchmaker talking up the bride’s beauty and abilities. He gritted his teeth and agreed to the marriage, but in the end, it turned out like this.</p><p>Although he no longer longed for a harmonious and loving married life, the bride’s suicide attempt on their wedding night made him both angry and annoyed!</p><p>Fortunately, there was no loss of life. That was the silver lining within this misfortune.</p><p>Being a man with a doomed and unfaithful destiny, it might have been fatal if he were to “taint” the bride to death on their wedding night. In that case, his already tarnished reputation would continue to plummet, and there would be no possibility of marrying again.</p><p>He and his two children might even be driven out of the village and forced to live in isolation.</p><p>Thinking like this, he could not help but hasten his pace.</p><p>Just as he approached the courtyard, he saw Liu Sisi sitting dumbfounded under the big tree roots, looking up at the sky overhead.</p><p>As daylight sprinkled over her head, creating a dappled halo that cast her pretty face in an extraordinary beauty, such otherworldly beauty was definitely not something an ordinary villager like him could match.</p><p>With this thought, Di Yelei felt an inexplicable irritation as he met her big eyes.</p><p>Their lost and helpless, teary, resentful eyes seemed like a frightened and pitiful deer, instantly striking the softest part deep in his heart. He could not help but sigh heavily.</p><p>“Are you awake? Why don’t you sleep a little longer? It’s hot outside, let’s go inside and talk.”</p><p>As his deep, muffled voice rang out, a pair of large, bronze-colored hands reached out, reflecting a shiny radiance under the sunlight.</p><p>Liu Sisi blinked, her disheveled mind not able to process the situation.</p><p>She pushed away his support, trying to get up with her weak legs, almost coming into intimate contact with the ground again, but was immediately caught by Di Yelei.</p><p>“Be careful! When you’re still weak, just lie down in bed, don’t come outside and try to act tough. You’re really driving me crazy!”</p><p>Finally, there was a hint of warm anger in Liu Sisi’s eyes, reminding her of everyone’s gossip and losing her temper.</p><p>Although the incident was caused by the original host, she didn’t inherit the information left by the original host. However, the man in front of her didn’t let her live or die on her own. He had taken care of her, sought medical treatment, and hadn’t sold her directly to the brothel. He had done more than enough for her!</p><p>Just as she was considering what to do, Di Yelei casually pulled her into the main entrance, and with a bang, the door was heavily closed behind them.</p><p>“Let go of me, you’re hurting my hand!” Liu Sisi struggled.</p><p>”</p><p>“Discuss what?” Ai Cangsheng elevated the Evil Sin Bow, halting Dao Xuanji’s advance with a fierce gleam in his eyes, shouting explosively:</p><p>“If Gou Wuyue brings back a Sleeveless, he must lose an arm.”</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao presided over the sacrifice of the chiefs of each faction, she must give her life for her post.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
