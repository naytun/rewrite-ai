Everyone will hear the voice of the god slayer; at that time, Lord Shou need not panic. In about the time it takes to drink half a cup of tea, He will personally introduce you to the background of the God Executioner’s Ruins.”</p><p>“Personally?”</p><p>“It should be. The impression the god slayer gives people doesn’t seem to be that of a killer; on the contrary, it is quite amicable… But as for what was actually said, everyone who came out has forgotten it. We have conducted many experiments on this, and not a single person has retained the memory.”</p><p>“Alright, there’s another question. My second true body has already entered the ruins once. Can my main body still enter?”</p><p>“It should be possible. We’ve already had Demi-Saint Zang Ren test this. The demi-saint incarnation entering the ruins hears nothing, does nothing, akin to the Heavenly Mechanism Puppet tested by the Holy Divine Palace—essentially the same as not having entered… If your second true body also didn’t hear the voice, then it’s probably deemed ‘false’ by the God Executioner’s Ruins. Only the true self can trigger…”</p><p>“The plot.”</p><p>“Uh… Yes, right, just like what Lord Shou mentioned, that ‘plot’ thing.”</p><p>“Good to know I can enter, I still want to take a stroll on the sacred mountain and give them a bit of pressure. If I can’t leave after causing upheaval, that would be quite the embarrassment.”</p><p>“Hehe, Fugui still suggests that Lord Shou could actually enter directly…”</p><p>“That’s a good suggestion, and I’ll keep it in mind.”</p><p>Unlike the usual trials, the biggest difference this time was that Xu Xiaoshou went from a chess piece at the mercy of others to one who holds the position of player—he could get to know a lot of information beforehand.</p><p>During the White Cave incident, he knew nothing. He plunged straight in, and after all the chaos, the exploding White Cave didn’t yield him much benefit.</p><p>The Flame Python, the Fourth Sword, were all traps, mere scraps of paper left for someone else to wipe their backsides with afterward.</p><p>On Abyss Island, he also was clueless, rushing in to fight a cockroach-like Spirit Division creature that seemed strangely invincible—how could it be so strong with just the Upanished Cutting Path technique?</p><p>In the end, he realized that this damn creature was one of his own. The Crystal Palace wasn’t keen on going back; to give everything to him, they beseeched him to stop fighting, there really was no need…</p><p>It wasn’t just Yan Wuse who was dumbfounded when the Water Ghost wore the mask!</p><p>But now things are different.</p><p>The times have changed.</p><p>Sitting in the Apricot Realm, enjoying a cup of tea, Xu Xiaoshou could indulge in the intelligence that others had secured at the cost of their lives.</p><p>He finally experienced the kind of joy of planning that Bazhun’an and Dao Qiongcang felt. He became the type of person he once loathed the most.</p><p>Slowing many others in their entrance to the Ran Ming ruins, he had considerably more control over the information inside due to Li Fugui’s presence, much more than most of those headless flies.</p><p>In the past, he was a character who fought fiercely for survival. Now, apart from not personally feeding the Infernal Fire Seed to others, lacking a bald head and dark circles under his eyes, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t feel much different from Elder Sang.</p><p>“Ah, the cost of growth…”</p><p>When he landed in the Ran Ming ruins, his “Perception” scanned the surroundings and transmitted the imagery into his mind before his eyes could adjust.</p><p>A barren wilderness.</p><p>No threat.</p><p>“That’s good. I didn’t land next to Yue Gongli. The Holy Divine Palace’s only chance to eliminate me is gone.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could then concentrate on the voice in his mind, and he realized Li Fugui still fell short:</p><p>It wasn’t just a voice.</p><p>After a moment, he also saw images, plots unfolding!</p><p>…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The chaotic world shook, heaven and earth cracked, and ultimately, the entire plane was torn to shreds by the chaotic forces.</p><p>“The Divine Battle…”</p><p>The hollow voice of the god slayer Ran Ming emerged.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou became acutely alert, and images and terms flashed through his mind—the void general, the Demon God, among others—all remnants of Abyss Island, thin threads connected to the unknown.</p><p>He realized that what was about to happen might not be something to gloss over with closed eyes, and it was important to watch closely.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thus gathered his thoughts, ready to penetrate the essence of the images in his mind, immersing himself in an attempt to discern some hidden details…</p><p>And indeed, he noticed some nuances!</p><p>In the midst of the Divine Battle, among the chaotic intertwining forces, included the Heavenly Ancestor’s Power, the Diabolical Force, the Power of Divinity, the Ancestor of Sorcery… or rather, something leaning towards a pure power of the evil god even more sinister than Ai Cangsheng’s.</p><p>“Such subtlety…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost missed this minor detail in the opening scene.</p><p>Because within it lay a thick presence of the power of guidance and the power of oblivion, tempting one to actively ignore it.</p><p>But lately, he had tasted this feeling of being guided and forgotten too many times, all thanks to Hallmaster Dao.</p><p>So even without using “Spirit Awakening” as a reminder, as soon as that uncomfortable sensation appeared, he knew “something was off.”</p><p>He found that he had become a bit desensitized…</p><p>Perhaps because he had reached the Upanished Level on various Great Dao Discs?</p><p>Or perhaps because he already possessed both the Heavenly Ancestor’s and Dragon Ancestor’s powers, as well as a basic understanding of other ancestral sources of power?</p><p>Perhaps it was a mixture of both, as he increasingly approached “Holy Emperor” status, becoming ever more sensitive!</p><p>“The Heavenly Ancestor’s Power…”</p><p>Feeling that familiar power, Xu Xiaoshou was certain the other demi-saints, and even The Divine and Ai Cangsheng, if they came, would likely not notice this detail.</p><p>Because they probably couldn’t distinguish that it was the Heavenly Ancestor’s Power—in this world, probably only he knew what the Heavenly Ancestor’s Power looked like.</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
