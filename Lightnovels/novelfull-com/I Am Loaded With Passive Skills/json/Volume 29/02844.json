He has a talent for creating illusions with all sorts of emotions; his expertise in the Emotionless Sword Technique is not low. The only pity is that he is not adept in the Phantom Swords Technique.”</p><p>“Elder Gu’s seniority is too great; he’s from many eras ago. He could discuss illusions with Elder You Tu, the compassionate heart with Master Siren, and tens of thousands with Elder Yang Xizhi and my family head. In the end, he concluded with the emotion sword technique and took the helm of the Way of the Sword.”</p><p>.com</p><p>“It can be said that he is the most standard ancient swordsman, unbiased, and maintaining serenity. Besides Li Fuyu, the Liu Sword Immortal, he follows the most orthodox path of the God of Sword, Gu Louying!”</p><p>“And now!”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui, looking at Elder Gu’s opening move, sensed the intent of the Nine Swords Formation and roared, “I’ll venture a guess for his first sword—it should be his most skilled ‘Planting Eight Gates Sword’!”</p><p>Swish.</p><p>The snowstorm halted.</p><p>The climate within the battlefield surprisingly began to warm slightly, giving an illusion that winter was leaving and spring was arriving.</p><p>Wait… It’s not an illusion!</p><p>It really warmed up, even the climate changed?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held his breath, feeling the surrounding world’s snow and ice dissolving, the barren branches turning green, and couldn’t help but sneak a peek at the old sword immortal opposite him.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Gu Yu tossed up Mei Ziyu, the sword vibrated, and dissolved into eight illusions before gracefully descending.</p><p>Hum…</p><p>Immediately, the Sword Will shrieked.</p><p>Around Gu Yu, waves of imagery of various weathers surged out, including the spring rain at dawn, the scorching heat drying the forest, the desolate autumnal silence, and the fierce winter glaciers.</p><p>In the midst of these seasonal weather changes, it quickly returned to a balance, creating the imagery of the reversal of Yin and Yang and the confusion of day and night.</p><p>Eventually, the sky cleared, the earth became muddied, converging into one breath, and formed the imagery of ten thousand miles of chaos.</p><p>“The emotion sword, the Secular Sword, the Heavenly Phenomenon!”</p><p>Just as Xu Xiaoshou was beginning to sense something, Feng Zhongzui had already cried out from afar, followed by a rapid-fire outburst:</p><p>“Everyone here has probably heard of Sword Saint Rao’s All Life Form and Master Siren’s Unity of Mentor and Disciple.”</p><p>“Some say the Way of the Secular World is the highest for all life, but in fact, why should there be any distinction in their rank? It is just that the God of Sword, Gu Louying, cultivated the Red Dust Phase, reached the hearts of people, and thus held the Secular as supreme.”</p><p>“However, aside from the Secular, the mentor and disciple’s path can also gather countless beliefs, standing firm in one’s own heart; Elder Gu’s Heavenly Phenomenon takes its stance between heaven and earth, drawing from chaos.”</p><p>“If you ask me, heaven, earth, and man have their ranks, but the phases do not differ in superiority. It all depends on how the ancient swordsmen use it. Wouldn’t you agree?”</p><p>To the Five Domains Refining Spirit Master’s ears, this statement wasn’t anything special.</p><p>But to other ancient swordsmen listening around, this was undoubtedly a groundbreaking declaration!</p><p>Feng Tingchen’s expression tightened, about to instruct this uninhibited youngster, but as the words reached his lips, he suddenly realized there was some reason in Feng Zhongzui’s words.</p><p>Mei Siren looked at the lawless young man in surprise. Before this, even he had believed that the Unity of Mentor and Disciple was slightly inferior to the Phase of the Secular, considered a ‘small phase’…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but glance back at Feng Zhongzui.</p><p>Gu Yu even laughed loudly, his spirits soaring as he declared:</p><p>“Well spoken, there is no high or low among the phases, but gods and buddhas exist above all. Many have seen through the ancient times, yet few have distinguished clearly from human beings. Xu Xiaoshou, this first sword of mine will indeed be the ‘Planting Eight Gates Sword’!”</p><p>“Drawing from the time ‘spring buds and summer grows, autumn harvests and winter stores’, the order ‘Yin arrives, Yang follows, the turbid well clears’, with the Time Illusion Rank Nine, and using the emotion sword technique, ‘Heavenly Phenomenon,’ as a tool, I will guide it when necessary with the ‘Flying Cloud Token.’ Now, let’s see how you will break this sword of mine!”</p><p>As he settled with his words, Spirit Sword Mei Ziyu, surrounded by the eight great heavenly phenomena, leaped through spacetime, suppressed thousands of miles, and encompassed Xu Xiaoshou in that self-contradictory, self-generating sword formation.</p><p>Gu Yu’s eyes turned cold, his Sword Will burst forth, and he pinched a decision and shouted fiercely:</p><p>“Planting Eight Gates Transformation, sword set to birth, chaos arises!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
