A flash of inspiration crossed his mind, and he conjured up a wildly imaginative idea:</p><p>“She attacks with the sword, I defend with the shield.”</p><p>“So what is the strongest shield of an ancient swordsman? Indomitable, able to block even spiritual attacks?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickly thought of Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>To be exact, he thought of her Emotion Sword Technique’s second stage, the Emotionless Sword’s killer move… no, the Great Defense Move—Mountains and Seas Converge!</p><p>Having just achieved sanctification, having just touched the threshold of the Mountains and Seas Converge.</p><p>With that technique, Rao Yaoyao blocked countless attacks back then, including those from beings at the level of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>Of course, her Mountains and Seas Converge was pierced through time after time, and she faced defeat repeatedly after her sanctification…</p><p>Was it because Adorable Rao was weak, or because the Emotionless Sword Technique’s Mountains and Seas Converge was feeble? No! It was because each of her opponents was stronger than her, while the weaker Xu Xiaoshou would use his brain.</p><p>However…</p><p>The negative effects of Heavenly Abandon were still present, and Xu Xiaoshou at this moment couldn’t even condense the Way of the Sword Disc.</p><p>Even if he barely formed it, many of the divine path patterns would be blurred, difficult to restore in a short time.</p><p>Under such conditions, how could he possibly skip the Secular Sword’s All Life Form of Emotion Sword Technique and directly reach for Mountains and Seas Converge of the Forget-about-emotions Sword?</p><p>But upon another thought:</p><p>“The first level of the Emotion Sword Technique is the Secular Sword. The All Life Form is developed after comprehending the Secular Sword, like Master Siren, who is not the All Life Form but Unity of Mentor and Disciple.”</p><p>“Similarly, Mountains and Seas Converge is not the second stage. The second stage of the Emotion Sword Technique is the Forget-about-emotions Sword, and Mountains and Seas Converge is also developed.”</p><p>“All Life Form and Mountains and Seas Converge with respect to the Emotion Sword Technique—having the third stage, upon mastery, can lead to Godhood-Sealing and Ancestor of this Ancient Sword Technique, or rather, this entirely new Great Path.”</p><p>“They are, in a way, similar to some of the higher-level spiritual techniques in the Way of Spiritual Cultivation within the Great Path, like the Saint Martial Arts.”</p><p>“In short, All Life Form and Mountains and Seas Converge are similar to the swordsmanship in the Ancient Sword Technique, like the Fifty-four Sword Steps, but perhaps with even higher requirements…”</p><p>The comprehensions of the Way of the Sword were difficult to condense, but the blurred Way of the Sword Disc could still use the Special Passive Skill—Unity of Man and the Heavens.</p><p>And under the state of Unity of Man and the Heavens, Xu Xiaoshou’s realization quality for the sword was extremely high!</p><p>Based on that, the question arose:</p><p>“Is there a method where I can simply follow the concept of Mountains and Seas Converge, integrate it into the swordsmanship through Spiritual Cultivation, and innovate over the old?”</p><p>“That way, without ever breaking through the Secular Sword or the Forget-about-emotions Sword, I can perform a spiritual sword version of Mountains and Seas Converge?”</p><p>The emergence of this idea already began to stir an inexplicable excitement.</p><p>At the same time, Xu Xiaoshou could think of a few other bits and pieces:</p><p>“But if spirit and sword combine, can it still be considered Ancient Sword Technique?”</p><p>“If I really do execute it, and block the sword of Li Fuyu, will the Feng family in the Southern Region recognize the outcome of this battle, the existence of this sword?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not clear.</p><p>But he was never a pedantic person.</p><p>When he wanted to have fun, he was happy to follow the rules.</p><p>When he wanted to flip the table, what Seven Sword Deities tradition, whatever recognition from the Feng family in the Southern Region… it was all bullshit!</p><p>…</p><p>His thoughts passed in a flash.</p><p>In that instant, all the spectators from the Shengshen Continent and Apricot Realm could feel the aura of the path energy around Xu Xiaoshou begin to surge.</p><p>“Under the Fengdu Sword, what’s Lord Shou doing? Insight?”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui was shocked beyond belief, “At a life-and-death moment, who dares to do this? Does he truly think everyone is like the Ten High Nobles, willing to give Kui Leihan time for enlightenment?”</p><p>Cao Erzhu turned his head upon hearing the words, his eyes filled with a trace of resentment.</p><p>Brother Shou fights Brother Shou’s battles. Don’t drag my old man into it.</p><p>“Truly give it?” Feng Zhongzui let out another strange cry.</p><p>And don’t mention it, although the thoughts of Xu Xiaoshou were only for a moment, Li Fuyu, seeing the ripples of path energy around him as if he’d attained something, halted the slashing momentum of his sword for a brief instant.</p><p>But the weakened soul body, just having withstood the backlash of Heavenly Abandon, didn’t allow Li Fuyu to hesitate for too long.</p><p>Sensing Xu Xiaoshou’s attention returning, Li Fuyu’s paused sword stroke resumed:</p><p>“Fengdu Sword, point!”</p><p>Suddenly, from the gates of hell, a Soul Sword burst forth, aiming directly at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>And this gigantic Soul Sword’s mode of attack was indeed the Point of Path, the most piercing force among the 3000 Sword Styles.</p><p>To point at the big with the small, to point at the weak with the strong, to point at the nonexistent with the existing—where was this a Point of Path?</p><p>If this sword struck, wouldn’t the entire soul body be completely shattered!</p><p>“Buzz.”</p><p>Mei Siren clenched the Taicheng Sword in his hand.</p><p>He knew Xu Xiaoshou didn’t need his worry, but in that moment, he still involuntarily took a half step forward.</p><p>After all, the scene that unfolded was shockingly terrifying!</p><p>But did Xu Xiaoshou need any saving?</p><p>Under the looming Fengdu Sword, with all eyes upon him!</p><p>The flash of thought in his mind wasn’t limited to Adorable Rao’s Mountains and Seas Converge.</p><p>It also included Divine Oracle Number Two’s “Path Principles as Decoration”—the Divine Secret that forcibly draws from the power laws of the Great Path for personal use;</p><p>Along with Yan Wuse’s “Ten Thousand Path Retreat”—securing the self with the power laws of the Great Path, where even the power of time meets its match against this exceptional defense.</p><p>A disciple of a hundred schools of thought are all my sword masters…</p><p>“Spiritual Sword Technique·Mountains and Seas Converge!”</p><p>The Flame Python sword was drawn.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s body exploded with countless sword cognitions, like sprouting numerous spider legs.</p><p>The dense web of sword cognition pierced into the power laws of the Great Path, into the microcosmic orbit of all living and dead beings.</p><p>Rivers of devouring power flowed towards the self, radiating in all directions, and in front of the rapidly approaching Fengdu Sword, condensed a sky-covering azure half-barrier.</p><p>“What is this?!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
