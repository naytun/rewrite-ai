The analysis team had just finished assessing everything and was about to speak when they rushed to Yue Gongli’s side. Seeing her expression, they felt there was no need for analysis and directly asked:</p><p>“Go over?”</p><p>“Or not?”</p><p>That was the question…</p><p>Yue Gongli’s head was throbbing.</p><p>If the one taking the bait were any other person on the Ranking, how great would that be?</p><p>A single action could set off a chain reaction. If Huang Quan dared to come, she had the power to even afflict the God Fated Star of Zhou Tianshen onto that guy.</p><p>Then, she would activate the other factions—Saint Servants, Xu Yue Grey Palace, and so on, to gradually devour it.</p><p>The reverse was also true.</p><p>But it was Xu Xiaoshou who came…</p><p>As much of a problem as he was, his relations with the various factions were too delicate!</p><p>He was already one of the Saint Servants; this didn’t even need to be mentioned.</p><p>On Abyss Island, he had cooperated with Yama’s Five Decays of Heaven and Man; clearly, he also had a deep relationship with Huang Quan.</p><p>From external intelligence, it was known that he had contracted Greedy the Cat Spirit in Jade Capital City, and Palace Master Bai Zhou might even be willing to hand over to him her three God Fated Stars…</p><p>One after another.</p><p>Apart from her own hands.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have just entered the Arena, but in a short time, he could gather a large number of God Fated Stars in his grasp.</p><p>And his first choice, unfortunately, was Nian, accompanied by Zhou Tianshen…</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“It’s no coincidence!”</p><p>Yue Gongli suddenly came to a realization.</p><p>Now, anyone who still thinks of Xu Xiaoshou as a big fool is truly beyond help.</p><p>This guy might have even started planning for the Divine Relics while fighting Dao Xuanji outside…</p><p>Even his entry at this crucial moment might not be a coincidence!</p><p>Yue Gongli counted. She was just one God Fated Star short of ten, which would allow her to ascend to the Upper Realm, to the Eighteen Heavens.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou might be nearly there as well, gathering everyone’s…</p><p>Now…</p><p>It was a race against time!</p><p>Nian’s, including Zhou Tianshen’s, must not fall into his hands… Yue Gongli abruptly turned back to look at everyone behind her:</p><p>“Go over immediately!”</p><p>…</p><p>The Dark Forest.</p><p>“This, is a God Fated Star?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou inspected the human-head-sized polyhedral crystal in his hand, feeling the abundant no attributes power of the ancestral source inside, and was taken aback.</p><p>What is this thing?</p><p>The purified ancestral source power, Ran Ming is this strong?</p><p>If he were to bite into it and absorb… Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes swiveled, his Finger Sword came together, and he stabbed viciously at the God Fated Star in his hand.</p><p>“Don’t!”</p><p>“Lord Shou, you mustn’t!”</p><p>Several schadenfreude-like cries of alarm suddenly rang out around him.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Dazzling divine light exploded from the God Fated Star.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s Finger Sword was shattered, and after a violent shake of his body, he took half a step back.</p><p>But the human-head-sized God Fated Star, as if equipped with a launcher, was jarred into the high skies at an utterly terrifying speed after the attack.</p><p>“Whiz…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hastily swept his hand, shooting out a spirit thread that wove through space, and grabbed the jolted God Fated Star.</p><p>If it couldn’t be pierced, then so be it…</p><p>This object was even undamaged!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou himself was taken aback, what kind of material was this, so exaggeratedly strong, stronger than his own physique?</p><p>“Damn…”</p><p>He was shocked by the God Fated Star.</p><p>But the people around him were all stunned by this Lord Shou.</p><p>There had already been those who were curious about the God Fated Star, and Zhou Tianshen even tested it in public.</p><p>Besides sucking the power inside it, any attempt to attack the God Fated Star, depending on the strength of the attack, would either be shaken to injury or shaken to death.</p><p>When Lord Shou wielded his Finger Sword with such terrifying sword cognition,</p><p>To only break two fingers and retract half a step, with the God Fated Star frightening itself into fleeing?</p><p>Someone in a daze spoke out, “The Ran Ming ruins are about to change…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tucked away the God Fated Star, no longer impulsive, feeling a tremor in the palm of his hand, he glanced at the Ancestral God Ranking after it popped out and then took it back.</p><p>Very good.</p><p>First time arriving, reaching the seventh spot on the Ranking, discreetly telling everyone…</p><p>I’m here!</p><p>Come over to greet me!</p><p>“The Dark Forest…”</p><p>Soon, turning his gaze back to the oddly-named foreboding forest in front of him, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes landed on Zhou Tianshen’s increasingly exaggeratedly large belly.</p><p>The latter had not yet come around.</p><p>In the midst of all the pregnant men and women, that big cloth bag was still flashing with the dazzling light of the God Fated Star, captivating.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated for a moment. Actually, he felt a bit wary in his heart, but still stepped forward to the dark and desolate border.</p><p>Having come this far, what’s the big deal about having a child?</p><p>If Qiongcang Xuanji couldn’t stop me, if Bei Huai’s life couldn’t stop me, could a Life Forest and a child stand in my way?</p><p>“Here we go!”</p><p>“Is Lord Shou also planning to rush into this Life Forest?”</p><p>“I did not feel much from the others, whether he slew Dao Xuan or not, I do not know the concept, but those who know the power of the Life Forest and still dare to touch it…”</p><p>“I can only say, true man, true hero!”</p><p>The hero Xu Xiaoshou stepped into the Dark Forest.</p><p>An intangible ripple seemed to spread at this moment, and the Life Dao Disc autonomously fanned open, Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils twitched, and he suddenly felt a warm current shooting into his mind…</p><p>“What the hell?!”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
