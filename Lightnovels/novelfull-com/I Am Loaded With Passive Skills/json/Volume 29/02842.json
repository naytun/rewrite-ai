Rather, it seemed like…</p><p>Contradictory?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned.</p><p>This was the first time he had ever encountered such a peculiar sword intent.</p><p>Gu Yu indeed appeared noncompetitive, but at this moment, he wanted to compete; he was as the sword, and at this moment, as his sword came out of its sheath, it felt ‘out of place’!</p><p>Unreasonably, Xu Xiaoshou felt a chill, as if windswept and desolate. He knitted his brows and glanced at Master Siren, his eyes seeking guidance.</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>Mei Siren sighed deeply, providing no response and simply shaking his fan before moving far from the arena.</p><p>This time he left decisively, and Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t even see what was on his fan.</p><p>Non-interference?</p><p>That was to be expected; at this stage, each old man had his own choices.</p><p>Since Gu Yu had spoken, that meant he had prepared for everything, including achieving fervor or accepting failure.</p><p>It didn’t matter how much an outsider said or how much they advised…</p><p>It was useless!</p><p>“Again?” Feng Zhongzui, who was outside the arena, just grabbed the Dao Imparting Mirror and aimed it at the soon-to-be battleground, ignoring the cold gaze of the old family head, excitedly said:</p><p>“The third battle of the Seven Sword Deities… After Lord Shou’s insight, will he fight the first Sword Deity of the initial ranking?”</p><p>“Two Elders, Yi Xiao, Li Fuyu, Hua Lai, Bei Tian welcoming Lord Shou; this is the last name, fighting the strongest one!”</p><p>“It’s worth mentioning that the strongest of that time may not be the supreme at this moment, because of the insight Lord Shou just had… All the points on his Way of the Sword Power were nearly all lit up!”</p><p>“So, true or false, donkey or horse, one fight will tell!”</p><p>One must say, Feng Zhongzui was extremely good at finding these gimmicks.</p><p>This statement not only excited the spectators from the five regions, arousing their appetite, but even made Yang Xizhi beside him look displeased.</p><p>As if the second Sword Deity was nothing…</p><p>“It’s called ‘Mei Ziyu’, a second-grade spiritual sword.”</p><p>A rather poignant voice arose in the arena, and the mirror’s image appropriately enlarged, the voice amplifying as well:</p><p>“A long, long time ago, it was already a second-grade spiritual sword.”</p><p>“It has accompanied me through countless mountains and rivers, fought against countless people, including those you know well like You Tu, Mei Siren…”</p><p>Seeing Gu Yu’s fingers gently stroke the sword body, Mei Ziyu slightly trembled, brimming with spiritual quality and humming softly.</p><p>Compared to the vicious sword, Fourth Sword, Supreme Emperor Sword, Flame Python, Hu, and others, it was quite calm.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou followed the gaze.</p><p>The sword was apricot-colored, three feet long, three fingers wide, with grey spots on the sword body like raindrops, blurring the sword body with a layer of mist, extremely mysterious.</p><p>“Good sword.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
