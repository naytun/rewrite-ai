Otherwise, she wouldn’t have been badgered all the way from the Dongtianwang City to the Abyss Island.</p><p>Therefore, Xu Xiaoshou immediately understood why Master Siren had mentioned about another person previously.</p><p>Master Siren seemed to share the same thought.</p><p>After the elderly Sword Deity finished his chat, he looked into the distant sky and stared at the endless sea of clouds. He felt that the clouds were like waves, each wave higher than the last. His face was filled with admiration.</p><p>“I’ve calculated all the secrets of Heaven, ghosts and Gods are unpredictable…”</p><p>“The Manifestation of all living things!”</p><p>“This is similar to a ghost. It is not an illusion nor is it a Fantasy Sword Technique. It’s the ‘Manifestation of all living things’ that Master Siren mentioned!</p><p>Under the ruins of the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes, Xu Xiaoshou, who hid in a blind spot among the fallen rocks and had used the Vanishing Technique and Stealth to conceal himself, felt the calamity power spread in this place. Memories flashed across his mind, and he felt his scalp go numb.</p><p>The Manifestation of all living things!</p><p>Saint Calamity!</p><p>Master Siren was right. Rao Yaoyao had really chosen to transcend the tribulation when she challenged Demi-Saint Elder Han. She wanted to be conferred the title of Demi-Saint here!</p><p>What she relied on was perhaps the final stage of the Manifestation of all living things that she had just cultivated!</p><p>Looking at the aura here, it was tens of thousands of times stronger than when Night Guardian transcended the tribulation in the Deep Sea.</p><p>At that time, Xu Xiaoshou still dared to go in and chat with Night Guardian amid the Nine Death Thunder Calamity. Now, he felt that if he didn’t leave this place quickly, he might not even be able to withstand the aftermath of the Demi-Saint’s Transcend the Tribulation even if he used his Vanishing Technique.</p><p>“I’m done for, I have to find a chance to escape. I can’t stay here for long!”</p><p>The Hall of Unforgivable Crimes had become a ruin. The Frost Ferret had destroyed the place with one move, but it was also afraid of the Demi-Saint’s tribulation. After it landed, it looked up at the sky in fear and then searched around as it tried to find an escape route.</p><p>As for Rao Yaoyao, who was frozen inside the Ganges River, she did not utter a single word from the beginning to the end. However, after the appearance of the Manifestation of all living things from the world of mortals around her, even the power of the Ganges River could no longer seal her.</p><p>“Ka…ka…ka…”</p><p>The sound of the ice cracking was endless.</p><p>Not long after, a melodious Sword Light shot up into the sky. It was Rao Yaoyao, who had broken through the seal of the Ganges River with her sword and leaped into the sky.</p><p>The Manifestation of all living things- the only thing that Rao Yaoyao could rely on to resist the Demi-Saint’s all-out attack!</p><p>The Manifestation of all living things, which seemed to have been cultivated after she traveled through the mortal world, was guided by the Cang Godhood Sword and after it gathered the Power of Fate, its defensive power was terrifyingly high.</p><p>Even though the Frost Ferret had made Ye Xiao disappear with one strike and caused half of Xu Xiaoshou’s frozen body to break, Rao Yaoyao was not injured at all under the protection of the Manifestation of all living things.</p><p>The cold might have frozen the ghosts from the other world to death, but not all of them were gone.</p><p>A Demi-Saint could kill a world, but he couldn’t destroy all living beings in the Five Domains of the continent.</p><p>As long as all living things were not destroyed, Rao Yaoyao, who had cultivated the Manifestation of all living things, could continuously draw power from it and use it to resist the Demi-Saint’s Power.</p><p>High up in the air, Rao Yaoyao’s eyes were devoid of any emotions and only focused on the sword in her hand. She squinted slightly, as if she was waiting for something. Then, she opened her eyes coldly and looked up at the Nine Heavens.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>On the Abyss Island, the calamity clouds finally gathered and covered the entire Giant Kingdom.</p><p>The sky was completely dark and thunder rumbled ominously, as if the end of the world had arrived.</p><p>Suddenly, a thick bolt of lightning blasted downward and went straight through the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>The ancient Great Hall, which could trap even a Demi-Saint, should have infinite ingenuity. At this moment, there were countless arrays inside, but they couldn’t withstand this Saint Calamity that directly broke through.</p><p>The Saint Calamity passed through the First Hall of Sins and blasted the First Pavilion in the Sky. A scholar was struck by the lightning and his hair stood on end. He rolled out and looked at everything in a daze, unaware of what had just taken place.</p><p>All the people in the labyrinth of The First Hall of Sins were confused and stopped in their tracks. They wanted to escape from this accursed place, but they couldn’t.</p><p>Even a Demi-Saint wouldn’t dare to test the Saint Calamity.</p><p>This was also the reason why Jiang Buyi was temporarily affected by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>This was because for the Saint Calamity, regardless of levels and realms, those who couldn’t cross it would die, and so would those who helped. Those who were involved in it, whether actively or passively, would also die.</p><p>Even if a Holy Emperor came, it would only anger and intensify the Demi-Saint’s tribulation and turned it into a Holy Emperor’s tribulation. It would not be able to force this tribulation back.</p><p>The thunderbolt passed through the First Hall of Sins and accurately locked onto the person who transcended the tribulation in the maze. It struck the figure in the sky above the ruins of the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he had gone deaf.</p><p>Even though he was in his disappearing state and was immune to direct attacks, he could also feel the aura of the Saint Calamity that affected him. His whole body was numb, and his inner demons rolled about. His Dao heart scattered and was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>After the Heart Sword Technique eased a little, Xu Xiaoshou realized that his body had been torn apart and was covered in blood when he came to his senses.</p><p>The calamity power surged around his wounds and even his passive skills couldn’t recover for the time being. He did not know how long it would take.</p><p>“Motherf*cker, I’m suffering from an undeserved disaster!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou trembled as he looked over. He could only watch helplessly as the Frost Ferret, like himself was trapped in the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes, unable to escape.</p><p>Following the aftermath of the Saint Calamity, Elder Han was like a little kitten. With a bang, he was blown into a bloody mess. He was thrown into the spatial fragment and hurriedly escaped. He was seriously injured.</p><p>This mighty Demi-Saint Ghost Beast, the Frost Ferret, was now only the size of a palm, but it only dared to resist the attack of the Saint Calamity with its body. It looked at the Nine Heavens in awe and did not dare to use or reveal its Demi-Saint power.</p><p>Because this would lead to the evolution of the Demi-Saint’s tribulation, and at that time, all the people here would die!</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>An ear-piercing cry sounded.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around and saw a bloody, mangled figure standing in the dark.</p><p>Her face and body were covered in dark red blood. Her whole body convulsed and then stiffened. In the end, she turned into many three-legged black owls and disappeared into an unknown place.</p><p>“Ye Xiao…”</p><p>This person was really in trouble!</p><p>Without the Vanishing Technique to take refuge in, after being forced to an unknown place by the Ganges River attack, and then being blasted out by the Saint Calamity on the spot, whether she lived or died was all up to Heaven’s will.</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>Elder Han was no longer in the mood to look for Chen Tan.</p><p>Even if that guy had mentioned ‘Third ancestor of the White Vein’ when he tried to frame him, he didn’t dare to stay behind to take him away.</p><p>The Saint Calamity had no laws, but the Way of the Heavens had emotions.</p><p>Under the onslaught of such a brutal attack, the space in the First Hall of Sins was thrown into chaos again. The Hall of Unforgivable Crimes was no longer sealed.</p><p>The chaotic labyrinth passage had been blasted out of control by the Saint Calamity.</p><p>There was such a collapsed passageway in the middle, just like when Rao Yaoyao had descended. It was suspended in mid-air, as if it was there to guide everyone away. However, the space was very unstable as it hung there and was on the verge of cracking.</p><p>“Is this the Sword Deity?…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou retracted his gaze after his eyes swept over the place. He looked intentlyat Rao Yaoyao, who transcended the tribulation under the protection of the Manifestation of all living things in the void, and he felt a ripple in his heart.</p><p>He would no longer dare to think that there were any second-rate cultivators among the Seven Sword Deity.</p><p>Perhaps Rao Yaoyao was not smart enough, but when she found the path that truly belonged to her, when the Sword Deity became the Sword Saint, there would be another big shot in the world.</p><p>When the general was only focused on leading the charge, even the Heavens had to give in to her!</p><p>“That’s scary.”</p><p>Looking at Rao Yaoyao’s Saint Ascension in front of him, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he wasn’t only looking at the person in front of him, but also the Black Hand behind the scenes who directed Rao Yaoyao’s Saint Ascension.</p><p>It was just like the illusion Xu Xiaoshou had encountered when he had obtained the Weaving Expertise in the Fantasy Realm, the hand that held the net of the Order of the Heavens laws.</p><p>This hand had led to Rao Yaoyao’s defeat, arranged her growth, and pushed her to the high position of a Demi-Saint.</p><p>If he had not received Master Siren’s guidance, Xu Xiaoshou might have really thought that this moment was a coincidence.</p><p>But now, he knew that this was not the case.</p><p>This move has been played for too long. It’s too far-reaching!</p><p>For the first time, Xu Xiaoshou was afraid of someone he had never met.</p><p>This was a chess player of the same generation that even Bazhun’an had to treat with caution. He was a rising star that even Master Siren praised when he mentioned him, but his name was a secret.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>“Chess, you guys take your time to play. I’ll die if I play with you. I’ll leave first…”</p><p>He didn’t dare to think about it anymore. Taking advantage of the gap before the Saint Calamity gathered again and fell for the second time, Xu Xiaoshou aimed at the spatial passageway that had been formed the spatial disorder and with a swish, flashed over.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
