Can you hear me?”</p><p>There was no response, so Xu Xiaoshou asked again, but there was still no reply.</p><p>Strange and weird…</p><p>It was indeed strange!</p><p>Without any hesitation, Xu Xiaoshou reached out and was about to pluck the Dragon Apricot.</p><p>If the Holy Medicine in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer had grades, then the Dragon Apricot was undoubtedly at the top.</p><p>For a Spiritual Cultivator, only the first Holy Miracle Fruit he took was of use. It could help one’s Holy Power to break through from zero to one, but after that, it would only be an ordinary Holy Medicine.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot was different. The more one ate, the stronger one’s body would be!</p><p>That was why Xu Xiaoshou decided to use this precious Holy Medicine to lay a perfect foundation for his breakthrough to the Sovereign Dao Realm!</p><p>“Swish…”</p><p>As soon as his hand touched the Dragon Apricot, an obvious resistive force that turned into actual physical fluctuations spread out.</p><p>Having been warned by Lei Xi’er, Xu Xiaoshou was already on guard and immediately dodged and retreated.</p><p>“Come out!” He shouted loudly, even more certain of his previous thoughts. The Dragon Apricot had a spirit, and as expected, the Dragon Apricot couldn’t be picked recklessly.</p><p>Amidst the buzzing sounds, layer after layer of fluctuations spread out from the golden Dragon Apricot. Finally, the Dragon pattern on the tree trunk was activated and appeared. The light gathered to form an illusory Dragon Shadow that occupied the top of the Dragon Apricot.</p><p>This Dragon Shadow was extremely huge and beautiful. It had a five-clawed golden body. Its spine curled up in the air and revealed its extraordinary aura.</p><p>The scales on the Dragon’s body were complicated. If one looked closely, one could see that there were mysterious runes that contained the true meaning of the Great Path.</p><p>The Dragon’s horns were like that of a deer, and it had an extremely noble bearing. The Dragon’s beard hung down, and it gave off an aura of ancient vicissitudes. It was an aura from historical times.</p><p>“Human, do not be insatiable!”</p><p>As soon as the golden illusionary Dragon Apricot Spirit appeared, a thunderous voice that spoke in the human language came from all directions like a thunderbolt from the Nine Heavens.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s scalp went numb.</p><p>The Spirit of the Dragon Apricot?</p><p>This aura was simply too overpowering!</p><p>However, why did such this powerful Dragon Apricot Spirit only make its appearance now?</p><p>Where was it when he emptied out the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer? Why didn’t it come out to stop him?</p><p>As he stared at the Phantom Spirit of the Golden Dragon Apricot and its sleepy looking dragon eyes that didn’t quite fit its extraordinary aura as it tried to widen it, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly had an absurd thought.</p><p>“It couldn’t have been asleep, right?”</p><p>He gulped, then he recalled that this was the Yuan Mansion and he was the master of this world.</p><p>In addition, this Dragon Apricot Spirit looked strong, but from its words, apart from its powerful aura, it did not seem to have any killing intent directed at him, so Xu Xiaoshou became a little bolder.</p><p>He took out the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale and found that it didn’t even have the slightest accelerated heartbeat.</p><p>“How strange…” Xu Xiaoshou recalled what Lei Xi’er had said before and experienced something else.</p><p>“What… what is this?” Before he could say anything, the Dragon Apricot Spirit’s drowsy eyes that had struggled to stay open suddenly flared with excitement. It stared excitedly at the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale in Xu Xiaoshou’s hand and asked.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot evolved after it bathed in the blood of the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot was once worshipped by ten thousand Dragons in the Dragon Cave.</p><p>Without a doubt, what the Dragon Apricot liked most was anything related to dragons. And what I have in my hand is the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale.</p><p>Various thoughts flashed through Xu Xiaoshou’s mind. He clenched the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale and seriously, “It’s not food.”</p><p>“Ow…”</p><p>The Phantom Spirit of the Dragon Apricot released a powerful aura and it pushed away all the Holy Medicine and Spirit Herbs in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou only felt a great pressure. That was the result of the Dragon Apricot Spirit finally turning its eyes to look at him.</p><p>“Human, give it to me. The Herb Garden of Divine Farmer is yours.”</p><p>It was the same as Hong and its speech was from the ancient times. Xu Xiaoshou deduced this point. He was certain that the Dragon Apricot Spirit could not keep up with the times already.</p><p>He put away the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale and said apologetically, “Senior Dragon Apricot Spirit, this doesn’t belong to me. It belongs to an important person. I actually want to give it to you, but I’m afraid that important person would not agree. It would only bring you unnecessary trouble.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was testing the waters.</p><p>His first instinct was that this Dragon Apricot Spirit was very powerful, and his second instinct was that this Dragon Apricot Spirit was afraid of trouble.</p><p>He couldn’t give a reason, but he could tell from the pureness in its sleepy eyes and the lack of any killing intent in its rejection of people.</p><p>A dragon who didn’t like to fight… Dragon Apricot Spirit?</p><p>Perhaps it had lived for too long and was no longer concerned about many things and had been too lazy to come out when he emptied the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer?</p><p>“There’s karma, so it’s fine, haha.” The little bit of desire in the Dragon Apricot Spirit’s drowsy eyes faded and he scanned the human from head to toe and remarked.</p><p>“Human, since you have the ability to come into this Herb garden, choose a few Divine Herbs, then leave.”</p><p>“If your greed is insatiable, I will kill you here and turn you into fodder for the Holy Medicine. Do you understand?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression froze. He was not afraid of the Dragon Apricot Spirit, but rather, there seemed to be an underlying meaning to its words.</p><p>“Senior Dragon Apricot, were you asleep after you underwent some recuperation before?” Xu Xiaoshou chose his words carefully as he asked.</p><p>“Oww…” The Dragon Apricot Spirit nodded. Its sleepy eyes were already filled with impatience. “I’m not good at talking. The Dragon Apricot is not meant for you. Leave quickly and don’t disturb my sleep.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
