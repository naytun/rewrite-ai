(3)</p><p>The word ‘Disappear’ flashed across Xu Xiaoshou’s mind, but he thought of Ye Xiao and gave up on the idea.</p><p>With a buzz, something that looked like a bounded domain appeared and enveloped him.</p><p>“Ah!” Xu Xiaoshou stopped in his tracks and heaved a long sigh.</p><p>He felt that this was probably the fastest he had ever fallen from grace. Chen Ruye’s identity had not even been established, and Xu Xiaoshou had to come out and clean up his mess. It was really a f*cking mess!</p><p>The surrounding environment changed.</p><p>It was no longer the labyrinth at the First Hall of Sins, but a vast field.</p><p>The entire area was a sea of green and looked vast and boundless. Other than the lack of herds of cattle and sheep, this was the perfect prairie.</p><p>The light from the sky, daylight, fresh greenery, the wind… It was a whole new world that was a sharp contrast to the darkness at the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>A brand new time and space!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou understood that this was definitely not the power of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, but the work of Yama Chief Huang Quan. That person was as nauseating as Kong Yuhen with the space attributes.</p><p>“Senior, why are you chasing me?” Xu Xiaoshou turned around and said respectfully.</p><p>“You’re calling me Senior now?” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man slowly walked over, one step at a time and his tone was very calm. “Didn’t you just say that we were peers and there was no distinction between us?”</p><p>Oh my, he’s such a petty person?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was so angry that he laughed. Even Elder Han wasn’t as petty as you.</p><p>He was a Demi-Saint and he was very magnanimous and tolerant.</p><p>You’re so petty that you’re the most despicable of all despicable people, the most shameless of all shameless people!</p><p>“Hehe, I didn’t know that you were Senior Deva’s original body, did I? Maybe someone could be impersonating you?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wiped his sweat. “To be honest, I’ve heard of Senior Deva’s name when I was in Xu Yue Grey Palace. That’s why I tried the experiment. Now I know my mistake.”</p><p>“Why did you think that I was someone else in disguise?” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man seemed to be very serious when he asked this question.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>F*cking hell, it was just a casual statement. Are you crazy? Will you die if you give me a way out?</p><p>Can’t you tell that the main gist behind what I said was to let you know I have the support of the Xu Yue Grey Palace. Do you dare to touch me?</p><p>“Hehe…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled and shrugged. He didn’t reply, but threw out another question. “Why did Senior stop me? There’s no enmity between us. Just now, you attacked first, so I had no choice but to retaliate, right?”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was obviously a veteran at controlling the flow of communication. He didn’t answer, but stared at the young man in front of him and said, “You’re Chen Ruye?”</p><p>“Uh…” Xu Xiaoshou was startled and nodded. “Is there a problem?”</p><p>“You’re from Xu Yue Grey Palace?” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s manner was overbearing.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyebrows shot up and he realized that something was wrong.</p><p>This guy wants to control me?</p><p>But I’m so familiar with your method; It’s useless to try it on me!</p><p>You’re playing tricks and showing off your skill in front of an expert</p><p>“Senior, there’s no need to try anymore. Your Three Loathsome Eye is useless against me. I can’t be controlled by you.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou easily diverted the topic and used the Five Decays of Heaven and Man for a purpose he had in mind.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man didn’t fall for it and asked, “Since when did a person like you appear in the Xu Yue Grey Palace? Chen Ruye… The Sovereign Level Physique, the Way of the Sword, the Sovereign Stage… And he has also mastered such a strange evil technique. I think an ordinary person would have easily suffered from cultural deviation?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat. He felt that he had met his match.</p><p>He was very familiar with this Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s technique. He had used it on too many people before, and it was all about psychological attack and defense.</p><p>However, he had used it this way before because he couldn’t beat his opponent, so he could only play dirty.</p><p>What’s wrong with this old man?</p><p>He was so strong and had even sealed himself with a special time and space. Now, he continued to press him aggressively, one step at a time… What was he after?</p><p>Just for fun?</p><p>This was a pure psychopath!</p><p>“Senior, what are you trying to say?” Xu Xiaoshou looked at him, his hands clenched into fists.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man stared at him with his phantom-like gloomy eyes and Xu Xiaoshou felt a little scared, then he said.</p><p>“I’ve met Lord Sha Shengluo, the palace master of the Xu Yue Grey Palace when I once represented Yama to discuss a cooperation. Chen Ruye, do you know what was the outcome?” He asked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
