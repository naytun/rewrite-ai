After he thought for a moment, he still felt uneasy. “Why don’t you return to the Yuan Mansion first? I’m afraid that you might be subject to a random spatial teleportation in this labyrinth or something like that. If that happened, you’ll be done for…”</p><p>With a snap, Xu Xiaoshou grabbed his Junior Sister’s hand, but he felt his vision blur, as if something had changed.</p><p>Master Siren and Xiao Kongtong who were supposed to be in front of them had disappeared.</p><p>The end of the labyrinth’s walls was originally a passage that stretched as far as the eye could see, but now it had been replaced by an ancient wall with murals carved on it.</p><p>“What’s this?” Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils shrank. No way, did I jinx it?</p><p>At this time, he was sharply aware that his Junior Sister’s hand felt different…</p><p>It didn’t seem to be the delicate, tender, and youthful skin that was unique to his little Junior Sister, but was furry and hard to the touch, as if he had grasped the feathers of a bird.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned his head at the speed of light.</p><p>In the instant that he turned around, his expression had completely undergone a Transformation. This was not only a display of anxiety, but also a talent that he had cultivated after he encountered countless dangerous accidents.</p><p>The person next to him was also shocked as she turned her head and her body.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw a stunningly beautiful face.</p><p>She had cherry-red lips, a high nose, and fair skin. Only her eyes were hidden by her hood and were not clearly visible.</p><p>However, the lower half of her face was extremely alluring.</p><p>“I’m sorry…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to be stunned for a moment, but his thoughts spun wildly. He searched his mind whether he recognized the person in front of him who wore a black feather coat and had such a delicate face despite her huge frame.</p><p>The answer was…</p><p>No!</p><p>I’ve definitely never seen her before!</p><p>His gaze swept over her and landed on the shoulder of this extremely tall beauty. There was a three-legged Crow perched there.</p><p>“I seem to have seen you somewhere before?” Without any pause, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were filled with reminiscence. “Miss, you look like a friend of mine…”</p><p>He suddenly felt a sharp pain in his hand.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat. He used his ‘Perception’ to scan the area and found that he still held the woman’s hand.</p><p>It was as if this person was enveloped in a bone-chilling cold, and his hand had entered the dark area around her and suffered from frostbite.</p><p>“I’m sorry, the space was chaotic just now and I caught the wrong person.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou released the hand that was covered by the feather coat. He looked up and felt that the woman’s face in his mind became a little blurry.</p><p>He stared solemnly at it a few more times before he said, “I am Chen Tan, may I ask for the young lady’s name?”</p><p>First of all, the ability to cause his body to feel pain was definitely not simple. This person was minimally guaranteed to be a higher void level.</p><p>Secondly, to be able to enter the First Hall of Sins alone, in theory, even Double Dumba*s and Hong Dang did not have this kind of disposition, so she definitely could not be any ordinary higher void level.</p><p>In the end, if he judged her based on her face…Could it affect other people’s memories of her? This was not much different from the highest level of ‘Stealth’, right? This woman was definitely extraordinary!</p><p>“+(Stared At, Passive Points,+)+1.”</p><p>He didn’t reply, and he didn’t make any additional movements.</p><p>The eyes of the woman in the black-feathered coat, hidden in the shadows, stared at Xu Xiaoshou quietly until the coldness around her became more intense, and the light became even more sparse, as if everything was about to fall under the Nine Sereneties’ prison.</p><p>“She can’t possibly have seen my face before my Transformation. My reaction was already the fastest.”</p><p>“I have ‘Stealth’. If we teleported together at the same time, I’ll be the first to discover the others. No one could sense me in advance.”</p><p>“I won’t expose myself, even if she’s Xu Xiaoshou’s enemy; an enemy that even Xu Xiaoshou is not aware of…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou instantly confirmed in his heart that he could change his expression faster than the speed of light. Then, he fearlessly met the woman’s gaze and looked into the darkness.</p><p>After a long time, he finally lowered his head.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Miss. If I was rude just now, I apologize. It was an emergency.” Xu Xiaoshou raised his hand to show that he didn’t do it on purpose.</p><p>“I think the most important thing for us now is to find out what was the Transformation that took place in the First Hall of Sins. We shouldn’t create new problems and become our own enemies, right?” He smiled.</p><p>There was no response.</p><p>Was she a mute?</p><p>The corners of Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth twitched and he couldn’t help but complain.</p><p>How could there be a person who simply remained silent after she encountered such a sudden change? Only people who couldn’t speak would be like this, right?</p><p>“This seems to be a Great Hall?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t bother anymore. He turned around and looked at the surrounding environment and felt worried about his little Junior Sister.</p><p>The walls of the labyrinth no longer existed, and it seemed that what he had prophesied was true. After the space became chaotic, he was separated from Master Siren and the others, and was transported to this Great Hall.</p><p>The Great Hall was held up by twelve extremely large pillars, and the surrounding walls were painted with ancient giant murals. There was an extremely high cliff in front…oh, there were steps.</p><p>If one went up and crossed the desolate wall, one would be able to enter the Hall.</p><p>“Is this the main Hall of the First Hall of Sins?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt like he was in a dream. If he managed to arrived at the target location just like that, wouldn’t that be too sudden?</p><p>However, he soon realized that he had taken it for granted. This should not be the main hall of the First Hall of Sins because when he looked up, he saw the plaque at the highest point. There were ancient words carved on it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
