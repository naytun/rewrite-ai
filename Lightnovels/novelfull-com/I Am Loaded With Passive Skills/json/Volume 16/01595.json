In that case, could Ye Xiao also be the same…</p><p>“That’s not very likely.”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man knew what was on Chen Ruye’s mind and he laughed awkwardly. “If you knew that you had the Body of Death, would you have hesitated for decades and never dared to seek a breakthrough?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately understood.</p><p>Yes, this was the logic!</p><p>Ye Xiao definitely knew what her own body type was, and the temptation of the Five Extreme Physiques was too great, not to mention the one known as the undying and indestructible Immortal Body.</p><p>This meant that the Dark Division Chief must have tried it in the past.</p><p>Even if the process of breaking through was to experience death, she would definitely use all kinds of means to try.</p><p>Since she had yet to break through to the Immortal Body, it meant that Ye Xiao’s previous attempts had failed.</p><p>She only had the Body of Death. In terms of strength, she could not compare to the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, who had an innate and developed body-the Body of Decay!</p><p>“I feel that she’s still alive.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his head to look at the sky.</p><p>He was a suspicious person, especially after he witnessed all kinds of situations where destruction and resurrection had occurred. He had a deep understanding of these as he had personally participated in the killing.</p><p>Other than a reckless man like Teng Shanhai, the other Chiefs of the six divisions were hard to kill!</p><p>Even a brute like Teng Shanhai could only be killed by Jiang Buyi. Xu Xiaoshou was alone, so he could not guarantee that he could win against Teng Shanhai.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man laughed. “Are you looking down on me?”</p><p>“Uh.” Xu Xiaoshou was startled. “Senior, what are you saying? Your battle was really an eye opener. I’ve never seen such evil… hmm, a powerful ability.”</p><p>“Ye Xiao is undoubtedly dead!” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man said solemnly.</p><p>“If she’s still alive, she won’t be able to leave my spacetime. Once she does, I’ll mark her.”</p><p>“That will just be a matter of time.”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man could not find any trace of Ye Xiao.</p><p>He could only come to this conclusion. In his heart, Ye Xiao was already a dead person.</p><p>He even dared to threaten Jiang Buyi. With his ability, would he be afraid of Ye Xiao?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not agree with this point of view. “Senior, you have to help someone completely. You must have other means to find her and… Hmm, a second killing curse?”</p><p>“Why waste your energy?” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s eyes were very calm. “Who do you think you are that I should help you to this extent?</p><p>As soon as he said this, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt that the atmosphere around him was a little off.</p><p>He smelled the stench again.</p><p>This stench was not the stench of his blood and sweat or the impact of the battle after his body was cooked. Instead, it was a nauseating smell that came from the bottom of his heart.</p><p>He looked at his entire body.</p><p>Sure enough, the aftermath of the battle couldn’t cover up his damaged vitality.</p><p>All his passive skills ran wildly within him but because he was too close to the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and had been with him for too long, the power of decay had invaded his body.</p><p>It was like a curse that slowly dragged his already bad state into the abyss.</p><p>“Speaking of which, I still don’t know why Senior helped me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t afraid of the power of decay.</p><p>After his initial panic, he had already discovered that this was an inevitable situation when one stood next to the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>However, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was clearly in control.</p><p>He could not perfectly restrain his own power, but he had tried his best to prevent himself from being seriously attacked by using the power of decay.</p><p>Now, with just the luck of a passive skill, this bit of power of decay couldn’t kill someone in a short time.</p><p>To me, he’s a good person… Xu Xiaoshou understood.</p><p>“I’ve already said before. You are Chen Ruye and Yama has cooperated with your Xu Yue Grey Palace before.” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man said indifferently.</p><p>“Just because of that?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t believe him at all.</p><p>He didn’t have time to question these words during the battle.</p><p>After the battle, this reason sounded rather ridiculous.</p><p>This was really like the excuse that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man gave him when he helped Chen Ruye.</p><p>Moreover, he had almost paid for this excuse with his life. He believed what Chen Ruye said unconditionally and without reason, as if he had been hypnotized.</p><p>Even when he was facing the attack of the Karma Fire Soul Blade, he still looked for an opportunity that he had not seen at that time.</p><p>How long had it been since he used the Acalanatha skill?</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was not like Lei Xi’er. How could he know that Chen Ruye also had such an ability? How could he be so sure that Chen Ruye would also be able to hurt Ye Xiao and then risk his life in order to seize the opportunity?</p><p>This Chen Ruye character was just a disguise, and his essence was Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>In other words, for the sake of a strange young man, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man risked his life to seize an opportunity that he had no confidence in, and in the end, he really succeeded in killing Ye Xiao with a curse.</p><p>How much trust did he have!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could understand if it was Yama’s men who were working with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>However, he had never met this person in front of him before. They were strangers who met by chance and could not even be considered as acquaintances!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
