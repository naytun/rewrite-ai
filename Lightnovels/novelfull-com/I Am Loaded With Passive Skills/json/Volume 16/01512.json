(1)</p><p>“Come, hit me.”</p><p>When she landed on the ground, Lei Xi’er, who had tidied herself up, was confused by Xu Xiaoshou’s words.</p><p>Did his illness really act up again?</p><p>She couldn’t help but reach out with her hand to check if Xu Xiaoshou’s brain had overheated, but she quickly restrained herself.</p><p>“Beat him up, quickly, beat him up. This is such a good chance!”</p><p>A little voice filled with joy and excitement suddenly echoed in her mind, but Lei Xi’er did not do that.</p><p>“You should take your medicine.” She stared at Xu Xiaoshou coldly.</p><p>“I’m serious!” Xu Xiaoshou, on the other hand, was extremely excited. He wasn’t joking about the damage that the ‘Freeze’ ability was immune to.</p><p>In the previous attempt, after he activated the ‘Freeze’ ability, he had only consumed a small amount of Spiritual Source as compared to the explosion, and he was completely immune to the attack. Even his clothes were not damaged!</p><p>According to Xu Xiaoshou’s guess, as a powerful Awakening skill, it might not only be used against an explosive attack, but also for spiritual and soul attacks. He could use the ‘Freeze’ ability and would be immune to them.</p><p>“Didn’t you use the God Devil Eyes, the Devil’s Might and God’s Fall to forcefully control Wang Dachui and Rao Yaoyao on the Lone Cliff?” Xu Xiao couldn’t help waving his hand. His eyes were filled with anticipation. “Come on, use your most powerful mind control technique. Control me and attack me!”</p><p>When Lei Xi’er looked at Xu Xiaoshou, she really felt that he was seriously ill. After such a long time, she still could not understand how this guy’s brain circuits worked.</p><p>“Oh…” At this time, Xu Xiaoshou frowned and muttered, “I’m afraid the Devil’s Might move can’t affect me now. Use the God’s Fall. That is your strongest mind control means, right?”</p><p>“Yes.” After staring at him for a long while, Lei Xi’er finally realized that Xu Xiaoshou did not seem to be joking. She immediately pointed to the Point of Path and said, “It’s not just a control. It’s actually a mental attack. It can destroy a person’s spiritual will to achieve the effect of control.”</p><p>“Is that the strongest?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“Currently the strongest.” Lei Xi’er’s God Devil Eyes began to spin, as if she wanted to give Xu Xiaoshou a blow to wake him up completely.</p><p>“How strong is it?” Xu Xiaoshou was not afraid at all.</p><p>“I’m now at the Sovereign Stage. I can control anyone below the Demi-Saint level. Lei Xi’er paused for a moment. “As for the duration of the control, it depends on who the opponent is.”</p><p>That was really strong!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself that there was really no one else in the world who could control powerful experts like Wang Dachui and Rao Yaoyao at the Sovereign Realm.</p><p>“Then do it!” He said without hesitation.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, white mist erupted from Lei Xi’er’s God Devil Eyes. The speed of rotation was raised to the extreme and dazzled everyone’s eyes.</p><p>In the next second, before Xu Xiaoshou could react, a White Reborn Lily bloomed under his feet. At the same time, his Information Bar jumped.</p><p>“+ Ambushed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>So fast!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally realized how powerful the control of the God Devil Eyes was!</p><p>There was no need for any pre-spell casting and distance was not an issue. As long as it was within sight, it could be controlled with a thought.</p><p>It was no wonder that Wang Dachui and Rao Yaoyao who were on the Lone Cliff were affected. The power of the God Devil Eyes was truly too terrifying!</p><p>However, no matter how scary it was, he was already prepared. There was even a ‘sneak attack’ prompt in the Information Bar. Xu Xiaoshou, who had also mastered an Awakening skill that did not require any pre-spell casting, instantly revealed his new precious skill.</p><p>‘Freeze’ ability!</p><p>As this thought flashed in his mind, a layer of faint golden light emerged from the surface of his body and turned into an illusory Buddha statue.</p><p>The critical blow that should have hit his mind instantly felt like it had passed through a layer of cotton and was ‘immunized’ by the ‘Freeze’ ability.</p><p>“I am really immune to the attack!”</p><p>After activating this ‘Freeze’ ability, no matter how slow one’s thoughts were or how immobile one was, it would only take a single thought for one to close this Awakening skill.</p><p>Therefore, in just a moment, Xu Xiaoshou had completed the activation of the ‘Freeze’ ability. After being immune to any damages, he immediately closed it again, and then took the easy way out and appeared with a swish behind Lei Xi’er.</p><p>The black sword Hidden Bitter had already been taken out, and it was positioned in front of the silver-haired Lei Xi’er’s throat.</p><p>“If it had been a real battle, you would be dead already, so don’t rely too much on your God Devil Eyes. It’s not invincible.” Xu Xiaoshou chuckled and put Hidden Bitter away.</p><p>Lei Xi’er felt a chill run down her spine. She had yet to recover from Xu Xiaoshou’s series of defensive counterattacks.</p><p>“How did the God’s Fall become so ineffective?” She turned her head in resentment and saw the sneaky smile on Xu Xiaoshou’s face. “This is a move I just comprehended. With this, I am ‘immune’ to physical and mental attacks, which was why I asked you to attack me.” After he explained, Xu Xiaoshou frowned again. “By the way, was that really your strongest attack? ”</p><p>Lei Xi’er : “…”</p><p>” + Feared, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“+ Glared At, Passive Points,+1.”</p><p>“+ Cursed, Passive Points, +1, +1,+1,+1”</p><p>“No!” Lei Xi’er was obviously enraged and as she moved away, her fighting spirit rose. “I was afraid I would hurt you just now, so I only used 10% of my strength to attack you!”</p><p>Without any pause, Lei Xi’er’s strength erupted fully. Her God Devil Eyes was turned to the extreme as it suppressed the power of the demonic nature to the minimum. She mobilized the power of divinity to its full strength and in an instant, she repeated the move just now.</p><p>However, she no longer held back.</p><p>After she discovered that Xu Xiaoshou had mastered a new strange skill, Lei Xi-er used 120% of her strength.</p><p>“God’s Fall!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
