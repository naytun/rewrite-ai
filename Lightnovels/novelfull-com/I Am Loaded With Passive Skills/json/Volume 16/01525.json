Legend had it that it was the place where the Evil God had his downfall.”</p><p>“What he advocated was ‘to break through order’ and ‘pursuance of freedom’. As time went by, these proposals became very abnormal and have become the ‘disorder’ of today, as well as ‘pursuance of the true freedom of the body and mind’, which was also known as ‘indulgence’.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong didn’t hold anything back and explained everything very openly. He then paused and said, “Yes, the so-called Evil God in the Southern Region is equivalent to the Sword God of the Eastern Region.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou understood immediately, but he was still a little puzzled.</p><p>It was a good idea to ‘break the order’ and ‘pursue freedom’. How did the Southern Region fall to this state?</p><p>“No wonder he’s an Evil God…” Mu Zixi also muttered.</p><p>“No,” Mei Siren suddenly said. “The Evil God is just a nickname for the Southern Region’s Spirit Cultivator. Among the ten ancient ancestors, his real name is the Ancestor of Sorcery, or the God of Sorcery.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze turned, and he was slightly moved.</p><p>Mei Siren picked up the paper fan, looked at his student, and said softly.</p><p>“All the spells in the world come from the Ancestor of Spells.”</p><p>“Whether it’s the path of spiritual array, the strange sect’s evil technique… In the past, the strange sect’s evil technique’s actual name was the Golden Gate Arts, or the Divine Secret Art; in essence, they’re all the techniques of the ancestors.”</p><p>“It’s just that most of the ancient inheritances have been lost, so it’s very difficult to trace the origin.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>The art of the Divine Secret also came from the Evil God of the Southern Region… Uh, the Ancestors’ techniques?</p><p>“Yes…”</p><p>He suddenly realized something. He’d heard that the Spiritual Cultivators of the Southern Region were unorthodox. Some of them had even studied the art of the Divine Secret and created strange things.</p><p>It turned out that these legends were without basis!</p><p>The things they researched about came from proper sources, but they just couldn’t learn the authentic ones.</p><p>Speaking of the authentic…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly thought, between his own Weaving Technique and Hallmaster Dao’s Divine Secret, which of the two was more authentic?</p><p>If they were all inheritances from the Spell Ancestor, perhaps the things given by the system were more orthodox? But where did the system find these inherited experiences from among the Great Path?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to think further.</p><p>He usually didn’t want to think too deeply about these terrifying things, because other than getting scared, there were no other benefits.</p><p>“Let’s end this topic.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyes and smiled. He looked at the two Seniors in front of him and returned to the main topic. “How much of your ‘countdown’ time is left?”</p><p>“Six days.” Xiao Kongtong replied.</p><p>Just like me…Xu Xiaoshou turned his head to look at Master Siren, “Teacher’s, eight days left?”</p><p>“Yes.” Mei Siren nodded.</p><p>It’s almost halfway through, and you two are not worried at all?</p><p>In fact, Xu Xiaoshou was a little anxious. He had wasted too much time in the Yuan Mansion, while he waited for Lei Xi’er’s transformation. He didn’t expect that after he came out, the two of them would still be so calm.</p><p>Alright, since you guys aren’t anxious, I should not be anxious, either.</p><p>At most, when the countdown ended, everyone would die together.</p><p>It couldn’t be that a mere Abyss Island would bury Master Siren, the Seven Sword Deity and Eldest Senior Brother of Fringe Moon Immortal City, right?</p><p>In that case, it would be normal for me, Xu Xiaoshou, to be buried with them. In comparison, I’m too insignificant!</p><p>“Then let’s stop our chat and go to the First Hall of Sins?” Xu Xiaoshou suggested.</p><p>“Sure, I’ll leave it to Master Siren.” Xiao Kongtong thought to himself, “If you, Xu Xiaoshou aren’t in the least anxious, and even took time off to cultivate in the Yuan Mansion, then I am sure you must have a backup plan.”</p><p>Since that’s the case, why should I be worried?</p><p>Moreover, they were with Master Siren this time, so at worst, they would all die together.</p><p>It would be normal for me to die on the Abyss Island. I don’t think it’s possible a mere Abyss Island can bury Master Siren, right?</p><p>“You don’t plan to break through to the Sovereign Dao Realm here?” Mei Siren looked at his student. He was actually a little anxious, but when he thought about how Xu Xiaoshou’s countdown was shorter than his and his lack of anxiety, then what was he so anxious about?</p><p>There were too many people behind this kid, including Bazhun’an and the Master of the Black and White Veins.</p><p>The Abyss Island was his home. If Xu Xiaoshou said that he didn’t have a backup plan and was willing to waste his time and life in the Yuan Mansion, Mei Siren would never believe it.</p><p>Bazhun’an must have definitely left a trump card for Xu Xiaoshou, that allowed him to be fearless, even if he only had six days left on the countdown!</p><p>Since that’s the case, I should not be worried either.</p><p>“Why don’t you take this opportunity to break through to the Sovereign Dao Realm first? After you gain additional life-saving means, it’ll be safer for you to enter the First Hall of Sins.”</p><p>“I would like to…”</p><p>When he saw how calm everyone was, Xu Xiaoshou felt less anxious.</p><p>However, when he compared the breakthrough to the Sovereign Dao Realm, he felt that it was better to get rid of the ‘countdown’ that threatened his life as soon as possible.</p><p>Only the Heavens knew how much time it would take to break through to the Sovereign Dao Realm?</p><p>If he meditated, even if he made a breakthrough, it would take half a month. When he woke up again… Uh, it was a possibility he wouldn’t be able to wake up by then!</p><p>“I feel that this is not the right time to break through to the Sovereign Dao Realm, but in the First Hall of Sins.” Xu Xiaoshou had an agenda in mind and he tried to find an excuse to make Master Siren and Xiao Kongtong enter the First Hall of Sins first.</p><p>He could break through at any time. After all, he had Master Siren, his guardian to protect him. How could there be any accidents?</p><p>However the premise was that this possibility would appear once one entered the First Hall of Sins. One would inexplicably encounter the Death Exemption Token, make a successful exchange for it, and then the ‘countdown’ would be lifted and the breakthrough would begin.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
