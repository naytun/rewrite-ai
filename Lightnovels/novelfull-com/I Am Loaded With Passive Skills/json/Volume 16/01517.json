That was why he had such high hopes for this last shot.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>After the 30,000 passive points were swiped, the exchange for the Awakening Stone was successful; the skills were bound and the water began to flow…</p><p>“Awakening failed!”</p><p>“Awakening failed!”</p><p>“Awakening failed!”</p><p>…</p><p>The six consecutive losses from the start made Xu Xiaoshou’s originally sunny mood turn moody and his face darkened.</p><p>Fortunately, this wave wasn’t completely unlucky and could only be considered normal.</p><p>When the seventh float was thrown out, the Awakening Stone sank to the bottom of the pool, and a different popup notification appeared.</p><p>“Awakening successful!”</p><p>“Transformation (Awakening: second true body)!”</p><p>It was done!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes immediately lit up, and he felt as good as if he had received the perfect treatment for his late-stage obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p><p>The last Extended Passive Skill was finally here!</p><p>“Second true body?”</p><p>“Demi-Saint incarnation?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately connected the two together, and the corners of his mouth lifted involuntarily.</p><p>“Let’s try.”</p><p>He did not wait but took action immediately.</p><p>With a thought, Xu Xiaoshou was about to summon this newly awakened skill.</p><p>“Second true body, activate!”</p><p>However, the Demi-saint’s incarnation didn’t come out directly. Instead, Xu Xiaoshou felt an intense tearing pain in his body, mind, and soul.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>His face contorted and he let out an ear-piercing scream.</p><p>The “Eternal Vitality”, “High Spirits”, and “Transformation” in his body began to operate crazily, as if he used some kind of spiritual technique that consumed a lot of energy. He actually pushed these three passive skills to their limits at the same time.</p><p>Amid the pain, with the God’s perspective brought by his “Perception”, Xu Xiaoshou could clearly see that his body was undergoing an abnormal transformation.</p><p>The crack in his chest represented the boundary as half of his body was being pulled out. Even his spirit and soul started to split and gathered towards his other Clone.</p><p>But this “splitting” wasn’t just a splitting.</p><p>The other half of the body, mind, and soul that had been split apart had quickly condensed into the other half at the cost of an overwhelming consumption of all his strength.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s missing half recovered rapidly.</p><p>Other than his mind which was on the verge of collapse, there was not a single drop of blood lost in this “fission”. In just a few breaths, the pain was over.</p><p>The consumption used by his body was quickly restored by his passive skills.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>He stared blankly at his mirror image in front of him. This mirror image had half of his clothes torn off too when it appeared. He felt that everything was so unrealistic, like an illusion.</p><p>“How are you?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou greeted him and covered his crotch. “What’s with this partial underwear being torn away? Can’t you create one yourself? You’re seriously sick!”</p><p>However, he could feel from his own spiritual will that he was conversing with himself, as if it were a heart-to-heart talk with himself.</p><p>However, the strange thing was that he clearly did not give any orders to his second “true body”, similar to when he issued thoughts to his portrait clones</p><p>The second true body laughed and covered his crotch with one hand in embarrassment. He raised his other hand and waved it twice. Then he spoke to Xu Xiaoshou in his own voice.</p><p>“Hello, Xu Xiaoshou. I’m Xu Xiaoshou. Nice to meet you.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
