(3)</h1><p>1572 Frozen Ghost of the Ganges River, Shocking the Saint Without Word! (3)</p><p>He didn’t know where Ye Xiao had disappeared to. Perhaps she was already dead. But since he was still alive, she shouldn’t have died so easily.</p><p>Half of the Necromancers were dead, while the other half were frozen at the edge of the Ganges River, like eternally solid ice fossils.</p><p>Not far away was the lower half of Xu Xiaoshou’s body, which was a very scary sight.</p><p>And Rao Yaoyao, who had been hit by such a peak Demi-Saint’s full-power attack…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t believe it. His Perception sensed that Rao Yaoyao, who was trapped in the Ganges River, had no vitality breath.</p><p>No way?</p><p>She’s dead?</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>The bleak cold wind brought the sound of Elder Han’s raucous laughter.</p><p>Elder Han was very happy. The first person who tried to stop him had died. Next, he had to capture Ye Xiao and Chen Tan.</p><p>As for the next one to die, Elder Han thought that it would probably be Yan Wuse or Yu Kunpeng.</p><p>“Where is Chen Tan? I’m a man of my word. We’re on the same side, so hurry up and come out and pay your respects to me. I’ll spare your life and give you a ride.”</p><p>“You must know that resistance is now futile. I’m about to leave the ruins and go somewhere else. This is your only chance.”</p><p>“It’s impossible to get out of this Sea of Suffering on one’s own without the help of a Demi-Saint.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou listened quietly. He held his breath and fell to the ground as if he was dead. He made full use of his ‘Stealth’ and then he gradually disappeared into a corner.</p><p>“Woo…”</p><p>He could still hear the noise in his ears!</p><p>It seemed to have been there since he came out. Xu Xiaoshou felt suspicious and listened carefully while he was in the disappearing state.</p><p>He heard all sorts of sounds.</p><p>There was the sound of students reciting their lessons, the sound of farmers using their tools, the sound of officials riding horses across the street, the sound of the rich and powerful drinking and singing, the sound of the Emperor issuing a decree to the people…</p><p>Some people wept and offered sacrifices to their ancestors, some people sailed across the river, some showed their emotions under the trees, and some bade farewell to each other…</p><p>Some were happy, some were crying, some were angry, some were sad, some were frightened, and some were fearless…</p><p>There were all kinds of things in the mortal world.</p><p>“An illusion?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat, because he suddenly saw countless illusory villains on the ruins of the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes.</p><p>There were so many people that it was like a shrunken version of the Greater World with all kinds of people…The sounds they made were the noises he had just heard.</p><p>Above the Nine Heavens, Elder Han’s joy ended abruptly.</p><p>Obviously, he had also noticed this unusual phenomenon. This didn’t seem like something that the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes had, but rather something that was man-made.</p><p>“Ka!”</p><p>It was as if a dark thunderbolt had flashed across the sky, and the frozen Ganges River suddenly cracked.</p><p>Elder Han’s expression changed. He seemed to have realized something. Disbelief appeared on his face as he hurriedly descended from the sky.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“It can’t be the Fantasy Sword Technique!”</p><p>In his Disappearing State, Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils also shrank. He recalled the question he had asked Master Siren and a phrase hidden in the depths of his memory suddenly jumped out.</p><p>“Secular Sword, the Manifestation of all living things?”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At that moment, outside the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes, in the sky above the First Hall of Sins and the Abyss Island, the wind and clouds gathered. The sky suddenly turned dark, and dark clouds floated over and caused a strange disaster.</p><p>“Buzz.”</p><p>The sound of sword cries rang throughout the entire Abyss Island and alerted the Demi-Saint Yan Wuse and the mysterious Heavenly Oracle Number Two.</p><p>The two of them stood in the deep pit and took in the scent of the Holy Medicine thatdissipated around them. Yan Wuchen stopped cursing the instigator’s ancestors, turned around and was about to jump onto Number Two’s hand.</p><p>Without another word, Number Two’s body swayed, and the two of them left the Forest of Miracles at the same time.</p><p>On the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, the fragrance drifted for thousands of miles.</p><p>“Da!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang placed a white piece on the board, stood up and smiled at the person in the wheelchair.</p><p>“I won.”</p><p>“The game is only halfway through. How can we talk about winning or losing…”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng’s voice suddenly stopped, his brows furrowed, and he turned to look toward the east.</p><p>The Path Principles suddenly appeared in his eyes. It was as if he had passed through countless worlds of two regions, and also broken the shackles between the plains, and saw the future.</p><p>However, even his Eyes of the Great Path could only see a blurred image and could not see the truth.</p><p>“Who is it?” Ai Cangsheng could not help but ask.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang chuckled and shook his head gently. He turned around and left after he sighed.</p><p>“The devil of the Ganges River, the shocked and speechless Saint. If the situation changed, the military would be more refined…You can figure it out yourself!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
