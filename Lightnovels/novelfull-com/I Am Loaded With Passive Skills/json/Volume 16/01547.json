It seemed there had been a fleeting figure in the spatial crack.</p><p>Before that, when he fought with Yi and did the Soul Reading of Yi’s memories, he seemed to have crossed paths with this figure many times.</p><p>In the early stages of the memories of the assassins such as Double Dumba*s and Golden Foot, there were also vague memories of this black-feathered woman.</p><p>“But I’m sure that I’ve never seen her before…” Xu Xiaoshou was very sure about this and he frowned.</p><p>So what was this? The interference of the Holy Emperor’s will?</p><p>No!</p><p>If he had reached the level of a Holy Emperor’s will, he wouldn’t have been able to recall the details even if he knew the name ‘Ye Xiao’.</p><p>“The Dark Division Chief…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered this title in his heart and seemed to get enlightenment.</p><p>She was indeed very ‘dark’.” She actually had the ability to erase outsiders’ memories of her form. This was simply a method tailor-made for killers and other underground workers!</p><p>It was a pity that no matter how strong this ability was, as long as it had not reached the Saint Stage, it could not affect the deep impression that people left on his ‘Perception’…Xu Xiaoshou remembered everything.</p><p>He looked up and saw Ye Xiao’s silent eyes peeking through the darkness under the hood, like the God of Death. Xu Xiaoshou could only see the lower half of her face.</p><p>The lower half of her face was breathtaking every time he saw it.</p><p>This was because he had basically forgotten all about her each time he shifted his gaze away.</p><p>“You recognize me?” Ye Xiao suddenly stated with certainty.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed in his heart. If this woman took off the black feather coat and changed into normal clothes, she could probably just walk past him. As long as she didn’t take the initiative to tell him her name, he wouldn’t have recognized her.</p><p>Of course, the only reason she didn’t do that was because she had absolute confidence in her own abilities.</p><p>That’s right, as the Chief of the Six Divisions, who wouldn’t be confident?</p><p>Self-confidence was a human being’s greatest flaw!</p><p>“Of course I’ve heard of you, Dark Division Chief, Lord Ye Xiao.” Xu Xiaoshou chuckled. He calmed himself down and felt it was fortunate that his first reaction to any accident was always to find a new identity. This method simply put an end to 99% of the danger.</p><p>Chen Tan was good!</p><p>Chen Tan saved my life!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled in his heart. He spread out his hands and took two steps forward. His tone was full of respect and said.</p><p>“One of the six divisions of the Holy Divine Palace, the dark side of the continent’s number one faction and an executioner who lived in the shadows of people without being noticed.”</p><p>“Even I, who lives in the Southern Region, have heard of your great name, Chief Ye Xiao.”</p><p>“It’s just that to see you in person is better than what I heard about you. I never imagined that you, the Dark Division Chief, would have such a beautiful face… Tsk tsk!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s tone was respectful but also a little cynical. He was full of curiosity about the Chief of the Six Divisions, a trait that was in line with Chen Tan’s character.</p><p>Since the person in front of him was the Dark Division Chief and who was in charge of the dark side of the Holy Divine Palace, she had the power to act first and report later, and had a close relationship with the Chief of the Transformation Division.</p><p>In that case, her wisdom, strategy, and means should not be underestimated.</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou walked on, he examined his current identity.</p><p>Was there still a flaw in the new identity that Chen Tan had so hastily fabricated just now? Could this escape the eyes of the Dark Division Chief?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou completed his self-reflection almost instantly. There were no flaws at all!</p><p>Even if Night Guardian turned up, it was impossible to connect Chen Tan, who lived in the Southern Region and had connections with the Feng family led by Feng Wuhen, one of the Seven Sword Deity, together with the strange set’s evil technique, Ancient Swordsman, Phantom Swords Technique and the Ghost Inscription with Xu Xiaoshou, the wastrel and Saint Servant from the Eastern region.</p><p>What Chen Tan knew, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t.</p><p>Yes, it was Xu Xiaoshou from a few days ago.</p><p>And it was under such circumstances that Ye Xiao still did not believe in the identity of ‘Chen Tan’, so she made a move to test the waters…Xu Xiaoshou was alerted by the vigilance of this Dark Division Chief and he was even more determined to be more careful in the future.</p><p>This taciturn Ye Xiao whose words were like gold was perhaps even harder to deal with than Rao Yaoyao. Rao Yaoyao rarely made a move to test the waters. She always waited until the overall situation was settled before she dared to make any moves. And the reason why the overall situation was the overall situation was that it was difficult to determine!</p><p>“Chief Ye Xiao, I didn’t expect that I would be able to travel with you during this spatial disorder. It’s really a blessing amid a misfortune. My safety is assured.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the Dark Division Chief who appeared unmoved by his praise. While he tried to perfect the identity and character of ‘Chen Tan’ in his heart and tried to separate it from the ‘Xu Xiaoshou’ persona, he stepped forward and tried to build a closer relationship.</p><p>“However, I think that similar to the temptation earlier, it’s best not to make an appearance again in the future.”</p><p>“I, Chen Tan, have never done anything that would harm the Holy Divine Palace. I dare to swear on this, so you don’t have to attack me.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his hand and said solemnly, “This labyrinth is extremely dangerous. The Hall of Unforgivable Crimes doesn’t sound like a good place. If we work together, it’ll be good for both of us. If we split up, it’ll be bad for both of us. Things like ‘backstabbing’ might be rare for you people from the Central Region, but it’s something that we people from the Southern Region fear the most.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
