She said condescendingly, “Give it to me. This is the last time.”</p><p>The last time what?</p><p>A warning?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stood in the great hall and looked up. He felt that the Dark Division Chief was unattainable, but he was not afraid to meet her eyes. After a moment of silence, he said, “If…My answer is no?”</p><p>Ye Xiao didn’t say anything else. Her hand stopped in the air for about two breaths, and then she gently curled it.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>The sky was suddenly replaced by night.</p><p>After the space collapsed, a long and narrow giant mouth opened, as if an unknown existence staring at everything from outside the plane had opened its eyes.</p><p>This was the single eye of the God of Death!</p><p>When Ye Xiao’s eye, which represented death, opened, the hall was filled with a thick aura of death, and everything began to wither.</p><p>The hundreds of giant instruments of torture displayed outside were mottled and decayed. With a “crack” sound, their parts fell off one by one, as if their spirits had died and their bodies had begun to decay.</p><p>The murals outside the hall cracked and blood flowed out. It was like a child crying, and there was even the sound of a baby crying!</p><p>A bleak wind blew from nowhere, carrying a thick stench that assaulted the nose, sweeping through the entire hall. Not long after, it formed nine black tornadoes that soared into the sky, wreaking havoc and insolence.</p><p>As if doomsday had arrived, Ye Xiao stood on the shoulder of the death mage with her back against the eye of death. She stepped on the disaster of the undead, and her aura could swallow mountains and rivers!</p><p>“You’ve mastered the aura of the evil god’s power, and I’m the walking God of Death in the human world… Chen Tan, my patience has run out. You only have three breaths time to think.”</p><p>Ye Xiao’s eyes were indifferent, and her feather clothes were fluttering in the air. Her tone was cold and murderous as she tried to persuade him that “The only price to pay for this stubborn resistance is death.”</p><p>“Startled. Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that the loss of life force in his body was accelerating.</p><p>If it had been “1” before, it was only the effect of the ultimate attribute of the First Hall of Sins. Now, it was ” 10000″!</p><p>“Endless life”, “High Spirits”, and ” Transformation” were all running wildly, but they couldn’t compare to the speed of his health loss under the gaze of “Death’s piercing eye”.</p><p>“This woman…” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t suppress the fear on his face.</p><p>Ye Xiao simply had control over Teng Shanhai’s explosive power. She had the same status as Rao Yaoyao and also had the decisiveness of Night Guardian after being tortured by him.</p><p>She was indeed the Dark Lord who had obtained the right to ‘act first and report later’ from the Holy Divine Palace. The aura she had now was comparable to the aura of the evil god’s power… No, it was comparable to Teng Shanhai’s Demon God power.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was certain that the Dark Division Chief had mastered some kind of special ancestral source power!</p><p>She was a hidden trump card of the Holy Divine Palace. After activating this power, her side effect would not be as violent as Teng Shanhai’s.</p><p>If he didn’t bring out the methods used by the “Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou”, his problem would not be about how to defeat her, but whether he could survive in this hall.</p><p>But…</p><p>The price of exposure was death!</p><p>“God execution token…” Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the token in his hand, which was half the height of a man, and was already thinking about whether he should give it away.</p><p>“It’s not worth it, my life is more important, I’m scared!” He thought.</p><p>“I really didn’t expect that you, Ye Xiao, would be so fierce. You’re even fiercer than that crazy Teng Shanhai!”</p><p>At this moment, before Xu Xiaoshou could send out the “God execution token,” the power of the battle seemed to have triggered some kind of will. A weak voice suddenly sounded out of thin air.</p><p>“Stop fighting, the hall is going to explode!”</p><p>“Save me first…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou and Ye Xiao were stunned at the same time, and they suddenly turned their eyes to look.</p><p>The source of this sound was the cell that Ye Xiao had stayed in before, room number “Sky Three”- Sky No. 3 cell!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
