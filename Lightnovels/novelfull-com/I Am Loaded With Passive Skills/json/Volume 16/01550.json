He raised the command token in his hand.</p><p>“You want it?” He sneered and his gaze fell back to the large characters on the command token. He asked curiously, “What is this? ”</p><p>“God Execution Order.”</p><p>Ye Xiao lifted her head and her movement was so violent that even her hood was lifted up by her action.</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou saw it clearly. After the shadow that temporarily covered her face disappeared, what was revealed were a pair of amber-like glowing eyes and there was a coldness and certain charm contained in her long and narrow eyes.</p><p>“As expected, it’s impossible for a person with such a beautiful lower half of a face to not have beautiful eyes…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was slightly startled, and his mind began to spin. However, when he came back to his senses, he found that Ye Xiao was already in front of him. At the same time, she reached out her left hand again and directly grabbed the God Execution Order.</p><p>“She can even make use of her appearance?!”</p><p>Xu Xiao was convinced. This woman had really made use of every weapon she had to the extreme. How many guys had she deceived with this trick? That was how they fell for it, right?</p><p>Unfortunately, you can’t fool me!</p><p>I’ve seen eyes that are more beautiful than yours. I’ve seen more than a handful of them, both in men and women and even learned about the Lei Family’s Eyes?</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou leaned back so quickly that he left a white afterimage on the spot. He just barely dodged Ye Xiao’s next wave of attack, and laughed again.</p><p>“If I don’t give it to you, are you going to force me?”</p><p>His words were slightly teasing, but undoubtedly, they were full of provocation.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had given the Chen Tan character the characteristics of not being afraid of the higher void level. Otherwise, Chen Tan would not have been sent to the First Hall of Sins and survived. As for his foul mouth, it was inevitable.</p><p>He initially wanted to be a good boy and create a new identity. However, sometimes he just couldn’t control his mouth. If that was the case, he decided to add such a trait to the Chen Tan character.</p><p>Sure enough, as soon as these words came out of his mouth, the air in the entire main hall of the Hall of No Pardon froze a little.</p><p>As the earth trembled, the sky turned dark and the night fell. The whining soul sound once again appeared in his ears.</p><p>“You really want to fight?” Xu Xiaoshou was startled and the Ghost Inscription immediately appeared in his eyes.</p><p>He was glad that he had learned this Phantom Sword Technique, which made up for his biggest shortfall in the soul attack and defense methods.</p><p>At least he could see that he would not die inexplicably under the enemy’s attack, nor did he not know how to defend or where to defend.</p><p>With this Ghost Inscription, as far as the eye could see, the Land of Dark Night spell was once again summoned by Ye Xiao. This spiritual technique seemed to connect to the Yin Cao world through the black ground and this allowed the ghosts to enter the world of the living.</p><p>Anyway, Xu Xiaoshou was scared.</p><p>He saw that Ye Xiao seemed to be serious this time!</p><p>A mass of bones dashed out of the black land on a giant dragon that only had a skeleton that clung on to it. It was so huge that it filled one-tenth of the hall…</p><p>The ugly giant-like soul body with bulging muscles and two horns on its head appeared again. With a kick, it sent the bone Dragon flying. It bent its knees and jumped out as it held up the sky and the earth…</p><p>One after another, hundreds upon hundreds of hideous and ugly undead creatures emerged from the black soil, each with a distinct personality and almost solid soul body.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils trembled. He suddenly felt that Master Siren’s modest words, when he said that he was not good at the Phantom Swords Technique, were not really over modest.</p><p>It was because in this current scene, the ghosts summoned by Ye Xiao were more than one level stronger than the ethereal ghosts summoned through the gates of hell when Mei Siren fought with Jiang Buyi!</p><p>At least, no matter how they used their swordsmanship, any one of them could instantly kill the ghosts summoned by Master Siren.</p><p>If they really wanted to fight, only the Sword Image of the old Sword Deity and Yama could fight against these ghosts!</p><p>“Wu…”</p><p>It didn’t stop. The summoning of the Land of Dark Night continued!</p><p>The most terrifying things were the hordes of ghostly creatures that squeezed out of the Great Hall and the three-legged black owls that covered the sky that screeched as they pounced down!</p><p>They were the main culprits that caused the sky to turn dark. Their numbers were unparalleled, like a swarm of locusts. After they dived down, they killed the terrifying monsters that emerged from the black soil…one at a time!</p><p>“艹!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s scalp went numb.</p><p>After they devoured the ghostly beings, the three-legged black owls condensed into a ball and turned into a black tornado.</p><p>The next second, the black tornado dispersed, and a death image with horns, clad in a Black Death robe, atop a white bone dragon, with a death scepter, appeared.</p><p>Its muscles were so taut that it tore its robe apart. Half of its head was embedded in the ceiling of the hall, where even Giants were able to stand up normally. Its two eyes that blazed like the fiery sun turned and an illusionary three-legged owl flew out.</p><p>It felt as if the Golden Bird that represented the sun of justice had been contaminated and turned into an unlucky object full of evil.</p><p>It transformed from a small object to a big one!</p><p>It was so big that it covered the sky!</p><p>In an instant, these two dark things attacked Xu Xiaoshou’s soul and Spiritual Universe. It was impossible to avoid them because they were so huge that they filled the entire Hall of No Pardon.</p><p>“What was this ability?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was terrified. He had never seen such a strange ability before.</p><p>The specialized spirit of the Dao of the soul had never displayed such abilities. Even the Phantom Swords Technique, which was the closest to ghosts, was nowhere near this direction of cultivation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
