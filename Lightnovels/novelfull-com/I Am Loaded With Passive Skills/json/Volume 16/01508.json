She went over to the space where the corpse of the gold-swallowing Dragon was, without leaving any trace. She nodded and smiled, “Alright,” she said.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit was still not satisfied. Its gaze fell and landed on on the little fat cat in Lei Xi’er’s arms. “Do you understand?”</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>Greedy the White Cat Spirit’s fur stood on end. It was so frightened by the big monster’s eyes that it shrank back into its owner’s arms. Finally, it stuck out half of its head and nodded vehemently. “Meow… meow…meow!”</p><p>“Three, go and pick them.” The Dragon Apricot Spirit shook its claws in satisfaction, and after it sniffed the Dragon blood, closed its eyes and rested on the Dragon Apricot’s body. The light gradually faded, and was about to disappear.</p><p>“Three plus one equals four.” Xu Xiaoshou said hurriedly. He hadn’t forgotten about the previous Dragon Apricot.</p><p>It was a good thing to have the ability to trade for something of equal value. After all, the Dragon Apricot Spirit had been thirsty for such a long time and needed the support. However, it was also very nice to be able to enjoy something for free. He believed that the Dragon Apricot Spirit would understand.</p><p>“Alright, four then.” The Dragon Apricot Spirit said magnanimously and then disappeared completely.</p><p>The Herb Garden of Divine Farmer reverted to its tranquil state.</p><p>What a good dragon it was! Xu Xiaoshou’s face was full of genuine emotion and fake piety. He decided he would treat the Dragon Apricot Spirit better in the future, and then reached out to pick the Dragon Apricot.</p><p>As expected, he didn’t encounter any obstacles this time, and he easily obtained four of these treasures.</p><p>When he landed on the ground with four Dragon Apricots in one hand, his free hand accidentally touched a fifth Dragon Apricot, and the Recoil almost cut it off.</p><p>At this time, the Dragon Apricot sent out an obvious resistive force. Xu Xiaoshou’s ‘Recoil’ and ‘Sharpness’ had not even been triggered before he was sent flying.</p><p>“Hehe…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not annoyed. After he fell to the ground, he rolled over and got up. He then scratched his head and said, “I’m not good at math, so I almost picked one too many. Please don’t blame me, Senior!”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit was clearly asleep and was too lazy to respond.</p><p>Lei Xi’er looked speechlessly at Xu Xiaoshou, who walked quickly away from the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer as if he was afraid of being beaten again. She thought to herself, “It’s so obvious you tried to squeeze one more fruit after you saw that it’s asleep, right?” She had never seen such a shameless person before!</p><p>“+ Criticized. Passive Points+1.”</p><p>“Its attack power is quite strong. It was obvious it held back its strength against me. It’s not someone to be trifled with.” Xu Xiaoshou was not affected by this and glanced at the silent Dragon Apricot.</p><p>This was definitely a Big Boss!</p><p>In the future, if anything were to happen to the Yuan Mansion, he would use two buckets of dragon blood in exchange for its help. If that didn’t work, he would use three buckets. If that too didn’t work, he would use dragon meat!</p><p>After all, it was one of the Nine Great Ancestral Trees. It could even bear a Dragon Apricot, so its personal strength was definitely sufficient!</p><p>However, the Dragon Apricot Spirit had an even more obvious flaw.</p><p>“I’ve never seen such a laid back big boss before.” Xu Xiaoshou walked toward Lei Xi’er and sighed.</p><p>“Lower your voice.” Lei Xi’er was shocked.</p><p>“Don’t worry, this is my world. It can’t hear me, as long as I don’t call it by its name. I suspect that it has the combat power of a Demi-Saint, but it’s very lazy, so its combat power was reduced by half.” Xu Xiaoshou held the Dragon Apricot in his hand and examined it and his eyes began to glow.</p><p>“Isn’t that one of the reasons how you managed to bring it here?” Lei Xi’er laughed.</p><p>“That’s true.” Xu Xiaoshou thought about it and agreed. He was happy and stopped talking about it. He took a Dragon Apricot and handed it over. “Would you like one?”</p><p>The Golden Dragon Apricot exuded the aura of a peak Holy Medicine.</p><p>If it were Double Dumba*s and Hong Dang who laid eyes on this item, there probably wouldn’t be any part left of this Holy Miracle Fruit.</p><p>However, Lei Xi’er was unmoved. She shook her head slightly and said coldly, “No thanks, I have no interest in this Holy Miracle Fruit.”</p><p>Before she could finish her sentence, her small face suddenly scrunched up into a ball. She clenched her fists in front of her and waved them about. At the same time, she stomped her feet on the ground. A strange high-decibel scream interrupted her words.</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s hand trembled, and he almost dropped the Dragon Apricot. He only felt that his eardrums were about to burst as he stared at the silver-haired woman in front of him.</p><p>After a long while…</p><p>“?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s pretty face instantly turned red. She turned and reached out for the Dragon Apricot. “I’ll take one.”</p><p>With a swish, she turned around and disappeared.</p><p>“What the hell was that about!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was numb with shock.</p><p>Why was it that in this Yuan Mansion, other than himself, there wasn’t a single normal living being around?</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit had already shown its colors, but you’re doing this too?</p><p>That was Little Junior Sister just now!</p><p>“What happened to you? Tell me, what’s there to be embarrassed about? I’m your Eldest Senior Brother!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou let out a long sigh. After he vented his frustration, he found something biting his robe under his feet.</p><p>“Meow…”</p><p>When he lowered his head, it turned out that Greedy the Cat Spirit had left Lei Xi’er’s arms and was now at his feet.</p><p>At this moment, it had an aggrieved and longing expression as it stared at the Dragon Apricot. Its entire body language could be summed up in one sentence: ‘I’m hungry.’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou went crazy.</p><p>“You’re already so fat, and you’re still hungry?”</p><p>“Here you go!” He flung the Dragon Apricot far away.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit turned into a stream of light and caught it like a frisbee.</p><p>“In future, don’t say that I mistreated you!” Xu Xiaoshou glared at the fat cat with hatred as it gulped down the Holy Medicine Dragon Apricot.</p><p>“Calm down, it doesn’t matter if everyone’s abnormal, as long as I’m normal…”</p><p>“This is the crucial time for me to use the Dragon Apricot and break through to the Sovereign Dao Realm. I need to calm down.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou calmed himself down and chose a geomantic place for himself to sit down. Then, he held a Dragon Apricot in each hand and began to examine it.</p><p>“Eeny…meeny…miny…moe! Then let’s eat the one on the left first!”</p><p>He wasn’t sizing up the Dragon Apricot’s external structure at all. He just had a hard time making a choice. In the end, he felt that the Dragon Apricot on the left was a little bigger, so Xu Xiaoshou decisively chose the one he wanted to eat the most.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot turned into pure spiritual Qi and was absorbed into Xu Xiaoshou’s body, who had a fearless expression, through his nose and mouth.</p><p>Although the ‘Cooking Expert’ said that the taste of this thing was not bad, and might be very sweet, in order to maximize the medicinal effect, Xu Xiaoshou still used the Breathing Technique.</p><p>At this moment, the Yuan Mansion was filled with uncontrollable cheers of joy.</p><p>“Hoho!”</p><p>“Hurray!”</p><p>A human-shaped salted fish stretched its body on the ground and slapped and rolled up and down. It was as if it had been placed in a pan of oil and was being fried. The fragrance of the medicinal power spread out, but it was sucked back in as if the juice was being sucked away.</p><p>“Awesome, awesome!”</p><p>“Yo… yo…yo…!”</p><p>At the broken tower.</p><p>The silver-haired Lei Xi’er slapped her cheeks lightly with both hands. After feeling the cold sensation, she glanced indifferently at Xu Xiaoshou, who bounced up and down in the distance and had completely lost control after he took the medicine.</p><p>“Hehe…”</p><p>She couldn’t bear to look at it directly and turned to glance at the Dragon Apricot in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer. She could vaguely see some light and shadows floating on it.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit, the indolent king, who was bored to death by everything in the world, actually appeared and looked at Xu Xiaoshou’s antics in shock.</p><p>“Wu…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s body trembled. She didn’t dare to imagine that if she also had such a reaction after she took the medicine, and if she was seen by more than one person, how terrifying would that be?</p><p>It was more terrifying than death!</p><p>She lowered her eyes.</p><p>Lei Xi’er accidentally saw Greedy the White Cat Spirit standing outside the 100000 alchemy cauldron with a sated expression on its face. It did not care about its master’s embarrassing behavior at all.</p><p>It was focused on using its two front paws to hold the half-eaten Dragon Apricot. It was unwilling to continue eating, so it put it into its mouth, then spat it out again, then put it in again, and spat it out again. It repeated this cycle with thorough enjoyment and satisfaction.</p><p>One Dragon Apricot gave the cat a sense of satisfaction that could only be brought by eating a hundred of them.</p><p>“Ai… ai… ai!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was silent for a long time before she sighed, unable to come to her senses.</p><p>In the Yuan Mansion, other than herself, were there any other normal living beings?</p><p>It’s fine to be a weirdo, but why were all those non-humans so crazy?</p><p>“Hurry up!”</p><p>In her mind, a little ‘Loli’ with two ponytails began to shout loudly. Lei Xi’er finally understood what the phrase ‘Birds of a Feather flock together’ meant.</p><p>She laughed coldly, as if she was an outsider. She was extremely calm and very careful to keep her form hidden.</p><p>Then, she took out the image recording bead and sneaked toward where Xu Xiaoshou was.</p><p>“The 1322nd time, success!”</p><p>“Hehe…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
