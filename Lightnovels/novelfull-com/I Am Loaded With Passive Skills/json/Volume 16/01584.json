(3)</p><p>However-this required the use of the advanced ability of the Three Loathsome Eyes that Lei Xi’er had mentioned-the Mind-changing Aperture. This ability could forcefully distort and change a person’s will and make them his slave.</p><p>Even Greedy the Cat Spirit could not do this at the moment.</p><p>That little fat cat’s Three Loathsome Eyes could only make people go ‘Meow Meow Meow’ at most…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou became alert. He looked past Gu Qinger and glanced at the main character in the distance. He said, “I’m Chen Ruye from Xu Yue Grey Palace.”</p><p>At this moment, the atmosphere froze.</p><p>Xu Yue Grey Palace…</p><p>Gu Qinger had never thought that he would run into someone so well known from the Southern Region. He was also the only person in the entire continent who dared to interact with the faction of the Ghost Beast. He was completely stunned.</p><p>The Eldest Senior Brother’s warning rang in his mind, and Gu Qinger subconsciously wanted to retreat.</p><p>But soon, his eyes flickered and he stopped his retreat and faced the attack head-on.</p><p>“Xue Grey Palace? You’re the Ghost Beast host body? What sort of Ghost Beast are you?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could clearly see that when Gu Qinger asked this question, at the same time, the three gray flowers in the right eye of the orange masked man who hid in the corner in the distance, turned and had infinitely enlarged when he gazed at it with his ‘Perception’.</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>“It’s really the Three Loathsome Eyes!”</p><p>“Who’s this guy? How did he get the right to use the Three Loathsome Eyes from Huang Quan. Was Huang Quan not afraid that he would be under his control?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind exploded.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit did not feel much when it used the Three Loathsome Eyes and it felt that the power of the Lei Family’s Eyes was not very strong.</p><p>Now, he saw the great Gu Qinger being used by a method that went against his own will and became a puppet in the hands of the orange-masked man and spoke on his behalf.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s goosebumps popped up all over his body.</p><p>He quickly used his Transformation to suppress the possible abnormalities on his body, because there were more than three people at the scene. The fourth person peeked at him all the time.</p><p>“Shh.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou put a finger to his lips and shushed Gu Qinger to indicate that he was too noisy and should shut up.</p><p>“Shush?” Gu Qinger’s eyes flickered, and the anger in his head was ignited. His hand directly grabbed The Bewitching Demon in the middle of the sword wheel behind him.”Chen Ruye, what do you mean by that?”</p><p>He pulled out his sword and was about to attack.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was also furious.</p><p>The Gu Qinger he knew wasn’t like this.</p><p>Even if he was noisy when he was with his Eldest Senior Brother, he was still a polite gentleman.</p><p>How could the Three Loathsome Eyes control a person to such an extent?</p><p>At this moment, his eyes turned serious, and a murderous intent filled the sky.</p><p>‘Swallow the Mountains and Rivers’ formed a dense aura between his brows and suddenly suppressed Gu Qinger.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>The air around them churned.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wanted to use his aura to knock Gu Qinger out, so that he would no longer be controlled.</p><p>But Gu Qinger didn’t move an inch!</p><p>He was the first person Xu Xiaoshou had met who was oblivious to the suppressive force of his Swallow the Mountains and Rivers.</p><p>This was something that was rarely seen even in some of the older higher void level!</p><p>The sword wheel on Gu Qing’er’s back sent the Nine Swords flying out and the Acquired Stage turned into an endless golden light in the sky behind him. A majestic aura also rose into the air and attempted to strike and push back Chen Ruye’s aura.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly remembered Gu Qinger’s ultimate technique that he had glimpsed on the Lone Cliff.</p><p>He didn’t dare to let this guy use his moves. This guy was a higher void now, an actual higher void!</p><p>He had been used to his utmost limit, and almost everything had been squeezed out.</p><p>If they were to fight now, they didn’t even need to fight for long. Just a little longer and Gu Qinger would collapse and die!</p><p>When he thought of this, Xu Xiaoshou immediately changed his tactic.</p><p>His eyes narrowed, but he didn’t move at all. Instead, devilish energy appeared in his eyes.</p><p>Heart Sword Technique, Present Gods and Buddhas!</p><p>With a swish, the soft sound of sword cries rang out from within the labyrinth of the First Hall of Sin.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already restrained most of his power and only targeted Gu Qinger, but it was inevitable that some Sword Will would leak out.</p><p>At this moment, Gu Qinger’s aura had not even fully formed but he felt as if he had arrived in a world filled with destruction.</p><p>There were Nine Heavens lightning disasters, volcanic eruptions, floods and tsunamis…It was an endless apocalypse.</p><p>At the end ofall the disasters, there was a lone building.</p><p>There was a shadow on the top of the building, and it looked over.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>TheHeavens and Earth were dyed completely black. The demon bared its fangs and brandished its claws as it devoured everything.</p><p>The imagery of Xu Xiaoshou’s Heart Sword Technique crushed ordinary people and could even crush the Ancient Swordsman.</p><p>The imagery of the Sword God was so powerful that even Master Siren would fall under its attack, what more for Gu Qinger who was in an extremely weak condition?</p><p>Just one look.</p><p>From the beginning to the end, Xu Xiaoshou had only used one look.</p><p>Gu Qinger’s mind seemed to have exploded, and he fell to the ground, unconscious and bled from his seven orifices.</p><p>The devilish energy that was just about to seep out of his body was all swallowed up by Xu Xiaoshou after he closed his eyes, and his Foundational roots were not damaged.</p><p>“Sword Will…”</p><p>The orange-masked man in the distance couldn’t stand it anymore. He looked up in surprise.</p><p>He knew Gu Qinger’s ability better than anyone else. After all, they had spent more than half a day together.</p><p>Among the younger generation, who could comprehend the first stage of the Nine Swords Technique, the Infinite Number? Who would be able to comprehend the first level of the Ten Thousand Sword Technique, the Absolute Imperial Control?</p><p>As far as he knew, there were no outsiders, only Gu Qinger!</p><p>But this Chen Ruye from the Xu Yue Grey Palace had defeated Gu Qinger with just one look?</p><p>Of course, one of the reasons was that Gu Qinger was extremely weak, with less than 10% of his combat strength left. However, it also proved that Chen Ruye’s cultivation of the Ancient Swordsman was also very terrifying.</p><p>The successor of Wen Ting from the Burial Sword Tomb was not that easy to defeat, even if he was in such a weakened state!</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou listened to the hoarse voice and watched the orange-masked man walk over, one step at a time. He only laughed and replied in a low voice. “It’s just something that can’t be shown in public. I call it the Devil Sword Technique.”</p><p>“There’s such a genius like you in the Southern Region? Does the Xu Yue Grey Palace also have cultivators of the Way of the Sword?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou heard the surprise in his voice and shook his head with a laugh. “There are so many of them. Not only the Way of the Sword, but also all kinds of unorthodox methods. Do you want to experience it? Mr. Three Loathsome Eyes?”</p><p>As for Chen Ruye, Xu Xiaoshou had given the impression that he was an important figure who had the backing of the Xu Yue Grey Palace. He was not afraid of anything or anyone in the world and was very knowledgeable.</p><p>After all, how could someone who could represent the Xu Yue Grey Palace in the outside world be so ordinary?</p><p>Therefore, he didn’t care that he had seen through this person’s Three Loathsome Eyes.</p><p>When he saw the man in the orange mask walking toward him, Xu Xiaoshou still felt his heart palpitate.</p><p>There seemed to be a thought in his mind that frantically urged him to leave. If he continued to stay, only death would await him.</p><p>This was a sudden whim!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou remained unmoved.</p><p>It’s good that you’re strong. I still have an invisible God of Death about me. Can you be stronger than him?</p><p>“Oh, that’s right.”</p><p>When he saw the orange-masked man approaching, one step at a time, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t seem to have any heavy burden in his heart. He chuckled and said.</p><p>“May I know senior’s name? I remember that all of Yama’s members have some very stupid and funny nicknames, right? Your Excellency is…”</p><p>Da.</p><p>The footsteps stopped in front of Gu Qinger, who laid limply on the ground, and then stepped on him without any hesitation.</p><p>The orange mask almost stuck to Chen Ruye’s face, and the tip of Chen Ruye’s nose was pressed against it. The Three Loathsome Eyes that were hidden in its right eye suddenly emerged.</p><p>“The Five Decays of Heaven and Man.”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the three gray flowers quickly turned and flowed into his pupil. There was only a small black hole left in the right eye of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>The next second, the hole suddenly enlarged, and the pupil filled the entire eyeball, like a black hole.</p><p>From the black hole, a needle like a will slave token shot out and pierced Chen Ruye’s Spiritual World.</p><p>Chen Ruye also…</p><p>He didn’t even blink!</p><p>After a length of full three breaths, a wave of slightly teasing laughter sounded from the depths of the labyrinth’s walls…</p><p>“Five Decays of Heaven and Man? That’s funny!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
