Xu Xiaoshou’s team was made up of four people; did this mean that they could just wait and do nothing and the three of them would be released from their death warrant? It was like waiting for a pie to drop from the sky; Quite impossible!</p><p>“Then let’s go.” Mei Siren waved his paper fan and indicated to Xiao Kongtong to lead the way.</p><p>When they heard his voice, the few of them set off.</p><p>The light from the sky shone down on the vast long street and elongated the figures of the four people, that added a bit of joy and laughter to the lifeless Giant Kingdom.</p><p>Everyone was very relaxed and did not feel in the least troubled.</p><p>Apart from Mu Zixi, the three of them knew that each of them had a backup plan. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have been so calm about the death countdown.</p><p>Although it was his first time to face such a strange countdown, it didn’t matter if he didn’t have any experience, as long as someone else had it.</p><p>As the saying went, “When three people travel, there must be a Teacher in their midst.”</p><p>If my Teacher is not anxious at all, why should I be?</p><p>As a result, the four of them were relaxed on this trip to the First Hall of Sins, as if they were on a sightseeing tour. All of them were in extremely high spirits.</p><p>Other than the slight anxiety that had been deliberately erased, he was only curious about the internal situation in the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>On a journey without danger, the most important thing was to appreciate the scenery!</p><p>“There is a bit of danger within the First Hall of Sins. Ye Xiaotian said that when he came out of there, the Ultimate Attribute had already been activated. Now that a few days had passed, I’m sure that place would turn out to be even more terrifying.” Xiao Kongtong said as he walked. He continuously elaborated on the information he had obtained from the time he traveled with Ye Xiaotian.</p><p>“Yes.” Xu Xiaoshou glanced at Master Siren and thought, “The Forest of Miracles is already in such a state, and the activation of the Ultimate Attribute had already been repeatedly suppressed. With this Sword Deity here, what was there to be afraid of?”</p><p>“Yes.” Mei Siren also nodded gently and glanced at Xu Xiaoshou discreetly. When he saw how calm this kid was, he wondered how great was the trump card that Bazhun’an left; he didn’t even care about the Head of the Nine Extreme grounds.</p><p>“Master Dean?” Mu Zixi’s attention was diverted by something else. “Master Dean has also been to this place? Where is he?”</p><p>“He’s gone home.” Xu Xiaoshou rolled his eyes. This little Junior Sister was even more ridiculous than him. Her ability to grasp the key points was almost zero.</p><p>“There are quite a number of Void Attendants in the First Hall of Sins. Ye Xiaotian said that he was chased out, which meant that he was the only one who managed to escape due to his Space Attributes. All the others died in there.” Xiao Kongtong felt that something was wrong, but he didn’t think too much about it after he glanced at Master Siren.</p><p>“I’m not afraid of the Void Attendant.” Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand.</p><p>He wasn’t even afraid of the Void Attendant that protected the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>After he formed a contract with the Void General and being aware that he was the leader of all the Void Attendants at that time, Xu Xiaoshou only wanted to meet the Void Attendant again and ask him if he still wanted to be the guardian of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>There was only one answer to this question.</p><p>“Tsk…tsk…”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s face was filled with emotion. They’re all so arrogant, I like it so much.</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou was so arrogant after he signed a contract with the Void General. Why would he still be worried?</p><p>“Then let’s go in?” He did not reveal that Ye Xiaotian had faced hundreds of Void Attendants. He felt that it was better not to tell them.</p><p>The team finally came to the Great Hall. Coincidentally, they had not met any living person along the way. Of course, the Abyss Island was so large that it was normal not tot meet any living person.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong did not dawdle. He glanced up at the plaque, and after he confirmed that it was indeed the First Hall of Sins, pushed the door of the Great Hall.</p><p>Of course, he had to be the vanguard.</p><p>He was probably the only one qualified for this position. Master Siren only took action when there was an unresolvable accident. Xiao Kongtong was well aware of this.</p><p>“Let’s follow him.”</p><p>Mei Siren did not follow this particular order. As he watched Xiao Kongtong disappear into the illusionary mist in the Hall, he turned their head, spoke to his student and then followed him in.</p><p>“I’ll go first!”</p><p>Mu Zixi was the first to run out. In this kind of exploration team, the safest place to be was naturally at the center of the team.</p><p>The vanguard had to be the first in line to face any accidents, while the last one who brought up the rear of the team had to face the unknown, coldness, horror, and their own fear, which was even more terrifying than being the vanguard.</p><p>The little girl felt that she was not qualified to take up the position at the end of the line, so she was the third in line to rush into the Hall.</p><p>“Then I’ll be the tank at the back.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled. It felt like the group of four were about to break into a haunted house. It was really fun!</p><p>He did not hesitate too much. He did not even subconsciously take out the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale to check the risk when they entered the First Hall of Sins. He directly stepped in.</p><p>If they wanted to place the blame on someone, it would have to be on the two big bosses in this team. They gave off such a great sense of security!</p><p>It was so great that it overflowed! It was so strong that it was explosive!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not aware.</p><p>The first three people were still fine, as they entered the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>When he stepped into the gate of the First Hall of Sins, his entire body was hidden in the mist of illusion.</p><p>There seemed to be some vague errors on the plaque at the entrance of the Hall, as if the time and space had been messed up. It changed from the three words ‘First Hall of Sins’ to the five words ‘All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion’.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
