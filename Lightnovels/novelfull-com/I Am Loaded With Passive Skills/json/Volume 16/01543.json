When he encountered the next Void Attendant, he was no longer in such a sorry state. He could occasionally use his physical body, spiritual source and the power of decay to withstand a heavy punch.</p><p>One, two, three sets of bodies…</p><p>Giants like the Void Attendants were like precious medicine. They could only be swallowed up by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>Now, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had just swallowed his seventh Void Attendant. After he had swallowed five Void Attendants, he could already use his physical body to resist the Void Attendant’s attacks and also to retaliate against the giants’ attacks.</p><p>Now…</p><p>Combined with its decaying body and the Three Loathsome Eyes, this guy could instantly kill a Void Attendant!</p><p>Jiang Buyi did not manage to find the exemption order in the First Hall of Sins, but he witnessed the transformation process of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>He knew that this monster’s body was no longer inferior to that of a giant’s.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man could no longer be considered as a higher void level. He was a Demi-Saint in the guise of a higher void level and now he had obtained the Blood World Pearl…</p><p>“If I recover, would I be able to defeat him?” Jiang Buyi could not help having this thought.</p><p>He realized that he had fallen into a trap.</p><p>The purpose of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was obvious. Before this, he didn’t know what the risks were like at the First Hall of Sins. It was very likely that he had pulled him over to be a bodyguard.</p><p>This could be seen from the way he was beaten up by the first Void Attendant.</p><p>And when he found that he didn’t need his help anymore, this guy would do everything by himself and did not even give him a share of the profit…Not that Jiang Buyi wanted any part of the Qi of decay that the corpse of the Void Attendant had turned into.</p><p>“It’s a pity…”Jiang Buyi sighed when he thought of this. He knew that his plan was useless. This was clearly a conspiracy. Perhaps this was the tribulation that he had to face in his life.</p><p>“If you want it, just tell me directly, I will give it to you.” When the Five Decays of Heaven and Man heard Demi-Saint Jiang sigh, he held up the Blood World Pearl. His eyes were calm, as if what he wanted to give away was not one of the top ten Great Psionic Weapons, but a mere orange.</p><p>“No need. Whatever you get after you solve your own problems are all yours.” Jiang Buyi did not even think and replied directly, “My only purpose is the ‘exemption order’. As long as you don’t secretly obstruct me, I will be your friend forever.”</p><p>“A friend…” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man murmured softly. After a long while, he laughed and said, “Don’t use the word ‘forever’, Demi-Saint Jiang. There is no absolute in this world, only relative.”</p><p>Weng…Weng…Weng!</p><p>As they chatted, the sound of the clanging of swords could be heard from the corner at the end of the wall on the right.</p><p>The two of them turned to look at the same time, only to see dozens of small Void Stilettos that shot out from within. They did not have any intention to harm anyone; they only swerved at every turn and burrowed through every crack they saw.</p><p>One of them, unfortunately, passed the two of them and went into the pit in the wall caused by the corrosion of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, but it brushed past another small void stiletto that flew out from inside.</p><p>The two swords were stunned and stopped for half a breath, as if they were shocked by their companions’ sudden appearance.</p><p>In the next second, they continued to fly and explore the route.</p><p>“Ancient Swordsman, the simple use of the Ten Thousand Sword Technique…”Jiang Buyi sighed with emotion. “This is indeed convenient in the labyrinth. Even I don’t have any spiritual technique that can compare to it.”</p><p>“Sword cognition…” The eyes hidden under the mask of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man narrowed. “Demi-Saint Jiang, I know where Xu Xiaoshou is. Do you want to go and take a look?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?” Jiang Buyi suddenly turned his head. Frankly, he did not believe that Xu Xiaoshou was still alive. That guy was definitely dead.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man chuckled, but his laughter was cold.</p><p>“Think about it, how many Ancient Swordsmen are there on the Shengshen Continent? How many Ancient Swordsmen are there on the Abyss Island? Since they’re all here for Xu Xiaoshou, why wouldn’t they be on the same side now?”</p><p>“After all, they should have come over to the First Hall of Sins.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
