He stared at Xu Xiaoshou and said, “I can see that you have it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou subconsciously touched the teacup, but he quickly stopped himself. He didn’t pick it up; he just wanted to clasp it in his hands.</p><p>He thought of Kong Yuhen’s words and lowered his eyes, “My second question, why did you address me as…’A guest from another world’?”</p><p>“What do you think?” Kong Yuhen asked.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou snorted and said, “I don’t need to tell you what I think. What I want to know is what you think.”</p><p>“An interesting answer.”</p><p>Kong Yuhen nodded and said, “My All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion is in another time and space. You came from the First Hall of Sins, so aren’t you a ‘guest from another world’?”</p><p>“Is that it?” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t believe him.</p><p>“The Abyss Island is outside of the Shengshen Continent.” Kong Yuhen said. “It’s equivalent to being in another space-time. You came from the Shengshen Continent, so aren’t you a ‘guest from another world’?”</p><p>“This explanation is also very far-fetched.” Xu Xiaoshou sneered.</p><p>Kong Yuhen didn’t continue this time. Instead, he muttered to himself for a long time. His eyes flickered slightly before he said, “You’ve come from the Shengshen Continent, and I’ve always been in this world. As we’ve just met, aren’t you a ‘guest from another world’ to me?”</p><p>“+(Startled. Passive Points,+) +1”.</p><p>Even though he was prepared, Xu Xiaoshou was still frightened by the words of the person in front of him.</p><p>This was the first time he had met someone who could see through his very being. When he heard Kong Yuhen’s words, he almost jumped up from the tea table.</p><p>However, if he really reacted like that, it would be akin to a confession.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou relaxed his tense body muscles. He held the teacup in his hand and blew on it a few times. He blew on the tea in the teacup but did not drink it. He put it down, shook his head, and laughed.</p><p>“Funny.”</p><p>“I came from the Tiansang Spirit Palace, and there are traces of my past deeds in the Spirit Palace. You can go and look for it. I am not the ‘guest from another world’ you mentioned… Xu Xiaoshou wanted to give such an explanation, but he didn’t in the end.</p><p>An explanation was a cover-up.</p><p>He laughed as if he was reminiscing about the joke the person in front of him just told and suppressed the urge to mock him. Then he laughed again.</p><p>“Ha.”</p><p>“Did I see the wrong thing?” Kong Yuhen frowned.</p><p>With this, Xu Xiaoshou was instantly sure that the person in front of him didn’t have any Mind Reading Technique. It was really possible to deceive him, and he wasn’t invincible.</p><p>After Kong Yuhen questioned himself, he confirmed it again.</p><p>“That’s impossible. Although I might have forgotten some things, I haven’t lost much of my ability. I shouldn’t be wrong. You’re a ‘guest from another world’, right?” His eyes blazed brightly as if he wanted to look into Xu Xiaoshou’s heart through his eyes, and then dig out all his secrets.</p><p>“Yes,” Xu Xiaoshou looked at him with a smile, as if he confirmed what he said. In the end, he added, “As long as you think so.”</p><p>“Tsk tsk…” Kong Yuhen rubbed his chin and his expression became rather interesting to watch.</p><p>He first picked up the teacup and took a sip. During this time, his eyes never left the person opposite him. Then he put down the teacup, got up and stretched. After a long sigh, he leaned on the edge of the tea table and slowly sat back down.</p><p>“Friend, you’re very anxious.”</p><p>Kong Yuhen laughed and said meaningfully, “I can’t be wrong. The better you hide it, the more it proves there’s panic in your heart. I have to admit that you hide it very well, am I right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt like he was on tenterhooks, but he held it in and didn’t show it.</p><p>“I don’t have any ill intentions,” Kong Yuhen reiterated, then he said slowly.</p><p>“There are many visitors from other worlds in the Shengshen Continent.”</p><p>“All kinds of creatures from different extradimensional spaces are the same.”</p><p>“I don’t think you need to be more nervous and anxious because of this. You’re just one of the ordinary members in the extraordinary minority group. You’re not that important.”</p><p>He paused for a moment and without giving Xu Xiaoshou a chance to speak, continued and said.</p><p>“I’ve always treated the All Time Forgotten Snow Pavilion as a place where I could forget my worries. Naturally, I’ve been a little more direct, but I really don’t have any ill intentions.”</p><p>“What I hope for is that every friend who comes here can do the same, look into their conscience and return to their normal state.”</p><p>“Why?” Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but ask.</p><p>“There are many questions that don’t have a reason. If you really want an answer…” Kong Yuen spread his hands. “I don’t know either. I’ve said before that I’ve forgotten a lot of things.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou actually wanted to ask more.</p><p>He felt that the person in front of him was probably more knowledgeable than anyone else in the world. At least, since he started his cultivation, this was the only person who could see through his essence.</p><p>However, because of this, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t stay in this All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion.</p><p>Kong Yuhen’s true intentions…No, he had a good heart, but after he gave the third explanation to the ‘guest from another world’, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had not forgotten about it. Instead, he felt even more worried.</p><p>“I have a third question.” Xu Xiaoshou said.</p><p>“Please speak.”</p><p>“When can I leave this place?” Xu Xiaoshou asked without hesitation. This was the question he had wanted to ask for a long time. The fact that he could endure it until now and ask in a normal way showed that the level of his patience was much higher than the level of his pain tolerance.</p><p>“Anytime,” Kong Yuhen’s answer was unexpected. He stood up straight and waved his hand at the door. “You can leave now. My intention was to let people forget their worries, but I don’t want people to worry because of me.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
