After Jiang Buyi and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man were separated due to the space disorder in the First Hall of Sins, he met this little girl.</p><p>She couldn’t speak, and seemed unable to act on her own accord. She didn’t look threatening at all and resembled a puppet. Her cultivation level was only at the Sovereign Dao Realm.</p><p>Jiang Buyi could see the essence of this phenomenon. He could also vaguely sense the Power of the World in the body of this little puppet-like girl.</p><p>How terrifying was that?</p><p>Jiang Buyi had encountered too many incredible people and things in his trip to the Abyss Island.</p><p>There was a Sword Deity who could kill a Demi-Saint, a Body of Decay who was the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and Teng Shanhai who had nurtured the Power of Demon God…It could be said that no ordinary mortal could enter the Abyss Island.</p><p>He was now in the First Hall of Sins, one of the nine extreme grounds on the AbyssIsland.</p><p>In this sort of place, Jiang Buyi did not think that there would be an ordinary little girl with such a low cultivation level.</p><p>If that were the case, the little girl would not even be able to withstand the Ultimate Attribute of the First Hall of Sins. Her Life force would have been drained long ago and she would have died.</p><p>Therefore, she had to be a special existence, similar to Teng Shanhai, whose combat strength had soared after he awakened the power of the Demon God.</p><p>Otherwise, she was the forbidden puppet hidden in the First Hall of Sins. Once some special mechanism was triggered, she would be awakened completely and embark on a killing spree.</p><p>“Same old method, is that okay?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi gently bent down and handed over a key that contained a special power. He looked at the little girl whose face was so pale that there seemed to be no trace of blood in it at all.</p><p>He did not forget that he only had a few chances to attack. Thus, when this little girl targeted him like a curse and chose to follow him, he did not dare to refuse.</p><p>He had been on the alert against any possible strange behavior from the little girl, just like how he was always on guard against the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>When he realized there were none, he tried to make use of the little girl’s power.</p><p>For example, she could use her Spiritual Source and her own ‘array-breaking key’ to open the spiritual array seals in the Great Hall.</p><p>This way, not only could he reduce the number of times he had to take action, but he could also enter the Hall to explore and find the ‘exemption order’. It was a very good method.</p><p>Just like the previous few times, Jiang Buyi saw the puppet-like little girl nod slightly and she took the key obediently-it seemed she could not refuse him.Mu Zixifelt extremely panicky and flustered!</p><p>Her current panic-stricken state was even worse than the time she secretly filmed a moaning Xu Xiaoshou being thrown into the cauldron used to brew medicine after he was discovered!</p><p>She had clearly been with the three bodyguards a moment ago, but in the next second, the space was in chaos, and only the old man was left by her side.</p><p>It would be great if the old man had been Master Siren, at least her safety was guaranteed.</p><p>However, when she looked up, the memories that were sealed away in her mind reopened. Mu Zixi saw the scene whereby the old man in front of her had torn apart the Elders of the Lei family with his bare hands.</p><p>Jiang Buyi!</p><p>Her heart stopped beating immediately, and the blood in her body drained away. Her face was as pale as a ten-day old corpse.</p><p>Once upon a time, Mu Zixi had asked her Senior Brother a question. “How did you manage to stay so calm in front of so many Masters? You didn’t panic at all. Were you a born actor from birth?”</p><p>“I do panic!” This was what Xu Xiaoshou had replied to her at the time. “But what can we do if we panic? You can only imagine that you’re more powerful than them; you’re Bazhun’an, and all of them in front of you are only trash that you can crush with one finger.”</p><p>Mu Zixi felt that this answer was ridiculous, but she pouted and asked shamelessly, “Then in that kind of situation, what should you do to save your life?”</p><p>“You interrupt when others speak, and you reply with a question when they ask questions. In short, you can’t answer, don’t play your cards according to logic, and don’t give others the appearance that you’re being controlled by them. You have to hold the right to speak in your hands, control the situation, clearly know what results you want, and lead without giving away any traces.” The cocky Xu Xiaoshou spoke with fervor and assurance.</p><p>“I understand…” Mu Zixi was deep in thought.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou continued, “But if it’s you, don’t even think about it. If I’m not by your side, you can just wait for death. After all, you’re not capable of doing what I just told you.”</p><p>Mu Zixi still remembered that her head had exploded the moment she heard this.</p><p>As expected, no matter how hard she punched or kicked, she couldn’t hit this d*mned Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“What if I really do encounter such an extreme situation?” Mu Zixi asked again.</p><p>“That depends on the situation. It depends on the timing, location, people, and other circumstances.” The infuriating Xu Xiaoshou laughed. “To put it simply, if the other side is a fool, it’s useless no matter what you do. You can just wait for death. But if the other side is someone smart…”</p><p>“So what if he’s smart?”</p><p>“Then keep your mouth shut. Don’t do or say anything. This is the best way to save your life. You just need to pretend to be profound and let them think their own thoughts.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
