Bang! Bang!</p><p>Ye Xiao’s body finally fell to the ground.</p><p>After her control over them was severed, the Three Gates of Suffering turned into spiritual energy and disappeared.</p><p>The hungry ghosts, boiling soup, and Karma Fire Soul Blade that had been summoned from the gates… All of them were gone and what was left behind was only a desolate battlefield, a testimony to everything that had taken place there.</p><p>The green fields had long gone.</p><p>The only thing left in this spacetime was endless desolation.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man didn’t respond. He silently landed in front of Ye Xiao’s corpse and scanned it.</p><p>He had to admit that Chen Ruye’s auxiliary attack had allowed him to skip the complicated battle process and end this powerful opponent’s life in an instant.</p><p>Logically speaking, any Spiritual Cultivator below the Demi-Saint level would not be able to survive his powerful Qi of decay and his last ‘killing curse’.</p><p>However, would the Dark Division Chief Ye Xiao have died so easily?</p><p>She only had time to release a little of her God of Death power..</p><p>Her strength in this battle was displayed when she used frontal attacks, but she was also a killer who was skilled at assassination…</p><p>Even though all of this was assisted by Chen Ruye’s special attack, which caught Ye Xiao off guard.</p><p>However, if the Dark Division Chief had died under his attack, even the Five Decays of Heaven and Man thought that it was a bit hasty.</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man murmured as he squatted down.</p><p>He stretched out two fingers to touch Ye Xiao’s blood-stained face, turned her head over and frowned as he scrutinized her.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou walked over.</p><p>However, before he could speak, the orange-masked man suddenly released his fist and smashed Ye Xiao’s head into pieces.</p><p>Blood and flesh exploded. Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>“One should cut the roots to eliminate the weeds, to make sure she’s really dead… If she still wants to use this body to resurrect, this attack was necessary.” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man turned and looked over.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could see the unparalleled calmness in his eyes.</p><p>This person was more like the representative of the God of Death than Ye Xiao. With his power of decay and coupled with his cold temperament, he was simply an executioner in the Spiritual Cultivation realm.</p><p>Whoever he had his eye on would die!</p><p>“A Body of Death can also die?” Xu Xiaoshou thought of Elder Han’s words in the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes and immediately asked.</p><p>He felt that Ye Xiao’s physique was extraordinary, and she had possessed the power of the God of Death.</p><p>These things that were related to ‘death’ might mean that Ye Xiao was still alive even after she died?</p><p>“Body of Death…”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man pondered and shook his head shortly after. If she had a Body of Death, she should be dead.</p><p>“Only just?” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyebrows twitched.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man glanced at him. “I have one of the Five Extreme Physiques, the Body of Decay that is the most sacred physique. The Body of Death physique is indeed extraordinary, but if I did not make a breakthrough, I can’t withstand my power of decay, not to mention…</p><p>With that, he did not need to say anything else for Xu Xiaoshou to understand.</p><p>Even a Demi-Saint might not be able to withstand the injection of such a large amount of Qi of decay.</p><p>Even if he managed to survive and escape, he would suffer from this onslaught of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and would suffer from misfortune. He might even die at any moment.</p><p>From this point of view, the judgment the Five Decays of Heaven and Man pronounced on Ye Xiao seemed to be reasonable.</p><p>Anyone who had fought with him, even if they won, would suffer from the attack.</p><p>If he couldn’t get rid of the invasion of the air of decay, after the battle, he still had a debt to settle and would die inexplicably in the true sense.</p><p>This sort of physique was really disgusting… Xu Xiaoshou panicked at the thought of this.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was indeed as difficult to deal with as the grey mist figure, Feng Yujin. The only thing he was weaker in than the former was probably his cultivation level.</p><p>“From what you’re saying, the Body of Death can make a breakthrough. How does it compare to your body?” Xu Xiaoshou asked as he looked at Ye Xiao’s corpse that slowly aged and decayed under the gaze of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man before it disappeared totally.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man stood up and did not seem to mind as he explained to the young man in front of him.</p><p>“The ‘Swallow’ body, the ‘Seal’ body, and the ‘Body of Decay’ are inborn. They’re undeniably the top three of the Five Extreme Physiques. There’s no dispute about it.”</p><p>“As for the latter two, there was a competition in the past, and many special physiques were listed. In the end, they were also set.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of the ‘Ultimate Life Demon Physique’ and felt that his little Junior Sister’s body should be ranked among the Five Extreme Physiques, but he did not dare to ask.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s next words were unexpected, and it was not the answer Xu Xiaoshou wanted.</p><p>“The latter two are Acquired Stage physiques that can be cultivated after birth, but it’s very difficult, as difficult as ascending to the Heavens.”</p><p>“The first one is the Voodoo Body. Once it was born, it crushed all the other physiques. Apart from the other four extreme physiques, there is basically no other physique that can withstand the ability of the Voodoo Body.”</p><p>“The last type is the Immortal Body… Yes, that’s what I wanted to say. Ye Xiao might have that breakthrough.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>“The Body of Death can break through to the Immortal Body?” He asked.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“You really can’t die’?”</p><p>“Undying and imperishable! It’s even more disgusting and difficult to deal with than the other four. Otherwise, how could it be called a Supreme Physique?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
