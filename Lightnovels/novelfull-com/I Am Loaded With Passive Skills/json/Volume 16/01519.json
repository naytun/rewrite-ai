It was simply amazing.</p><p>“The only disadvantage…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou covered his head and stood up, but he was still a little shaky on his feet and his vision was blurred. “When it died, I was really in pain!”</p><p>It took Eternal Vitality, High Spirits and Transformation a long time to heal the injuries to his body, spirit, and soul.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried to form his second true body again.</p><p>He watched his body split for the second time from God’s perspective, and then watched his second true body, which had died just now, come back to life.</p><p>“Fortunately, the split only needs to be done once. After the split is completed, as long as the second true body does not die, you can directly summon it again if you want to use it. You don’t have to go through the initial pain.” Xu Xiaoshou had learned a little about how to use his second true body.</p><p>“Congratulations, another successful delivery.” The second true body that had just appeared was very sassy. “I think I’m not the first ‘me’ that you summoned.”</p><p>After Xu Xiaoshou held his head to ease the pain, he felt a wave of dizziness.</p><p>“This guy really can twist his words…”</p><p>“Successful delivery…”</p><p>“D*mn!”</p><p>“So, is this the amount of energy that others need to use when they talk to me?”</p><p>“From the looks of it, talking to me can be rather tiring… I want to kill myself, d*mnit!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly thought of Night Guardian.</p><p>This ‘red-clothed person’ must have been in so much pain when he chatted with him, right?</p><p>After all, their exchanges had always been rather intense.</p><p>“Speaking of which, I haven’t seen Night Guardian ever since I entered the Abyss Island. I wonder if he survived the Nine Death Thunder Calamity.”</p><p>“How do you know you’re not the first one?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>The second true body chuckled, “How can I not know who I am? With my cautious nature, the first one to be born will definitely die, and it should be due to an explosion. He died without an intact body… ugh…” He shivered.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rolled his eyes. Please don’t use the word ‘born’. Also, when you speak in the future, use ‘you’ instead of ‘I’. I am me, and you are you. Don’t beat around the bush. It makes me dizzy.”</p><p>“Oh.” The second true body nodded and chuckled. “So you know about it too.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>No, you’re just born, where did you learn to speak in innuendos, and why are you so arrogant?</p><p>“I’ll blow you up if you continue to be so sarcastic.” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>“I’m sorry.” The second true body immediately admitted its mistake. It bowed sincerely and said, “I’m really sorry. If I have offended you in any way, I’ll bow and apologize to you. Please forgive me.”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>And then it exploded…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clutched his head and hit the ground with his head again and created a big pit on the ground. He still couldn’t believe that the second true body he had summoned had such a bad attitude!</p><p>Was it sick?</p><p>After Xu Xiaoshou criticized the other party, he suddenly realized that perhaps he was the one who had a problem?</p><p>“Do I really have a problem? It’s impossible!”</p><p>He held his head and staggered about. Xu Xiaoshou was the first to deny that the problem could be himself. It would be great if there was a third-party verification. It was definitely the second true body who had a problem!</p><p>‘D*mn, it’s not even the right style, when do I ever use the ‘F’ word… Eh?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou made up his mind and resolutely stopped himself from having such complicated thoughts.</p><p>With a swish, he appeared in front of the small, warm wooden house that Lei Xi’er had built near the broken tower. This was now Mu Zixi’s residence.</p><p>When he pushed open the door, a little girl in a green dress with two ponytails turned around in a panic. “What do you want?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou went straight to the point and asked, “Do I annoy you by the way I talk?”</p><p>Mu Zixi was speechless.</p><p>Are you crazy?</p><p>What sort of question was this?</p><p>+(Cursed. Passive Points+) 1,+1,+1,+1…</p><p>She didn’t answer Xu Xiaoshou’s question. She grabbed her dress and twirled about. She smiled and said, “Xu Xiaoshou, I’ve changed back. Do I look good?”</p><p>“You look good.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded at first, then looked at her from head to toe a few times. His eyes were fixed on her and he subconsciously compared her with Lei Xi’er. He said with some regret, ” You’re just a little small.”</p><p>Mu Zixi staggered and almost fell. When she heard this, her face was filled with shock and her eyes blazed with killing intent.</p><p>+(Cursed. Passive Points+) +1,+1,+1,+1…</p><p>Pa…pa…</p><p>She clapped her hands.</p><p>“Little Tree, rise!”</p><p>With a loud boom, Xu Xiaoshou was sent flying into the air by a towering ancient tree that suddenly emerged from the ground. His Junior Sister’s crazy shrieks could be heard from below.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, get lost…”</p><p>+(Cursed. Passive Points+) +1,+1,+1,+1…</p><p>…</p><p>“I can’t deny that I’m a little responsible for my second true body, but it’s not a big problem.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou washed his face with clean water. After he calmed down, he finally saw his true self.</p><p>He waited until his three great passive skills had almost completely healed his injuries before he split into a second true body.</p><p>In fact, the consequences of injuries to the spirit and soul were very serious even if the surface had been repaired by his passive skills, At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou felt very tired and mentally drained.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
