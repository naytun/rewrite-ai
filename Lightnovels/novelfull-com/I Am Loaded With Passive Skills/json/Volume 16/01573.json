You were able to kill Demi-Saint Jiang with one sword strike and forced him to use the Demi-Saint’s incarnation to survive, but these two people are not like that. They are…very weak, yes, given that they have the title of ‘Seven Sword Deity’, they are a little weak.”</p><p>“Then you must be mistaken.”</p><p>“Impossible, I once saw Gou Wuyue fight with Bazhun’an in the Eighth Palace. He was no match for Bazhun’an. He was one of the Seven Sword Deity, but he was defeated by someone who didn’t even have the title of Seven Sword Deity!”</p><p>“Then you’ve only seen what’s on the surface.”</p><p>“Oh? In that case…What’s the actual situation like?”</p><p>“Gou Wuyue and Bazhun’an have a deep friendship. His saber, The Voice of Nulan, was the sword that Bazhun’an used in the past… Can you imagine it? It’s just like how if you died, your Hidden Bitter immediately took someone else as its master.”</p><p>“That’s impossible. Hidden Bitter is a Owner Devouring sword.”</p><p>“But Gou Wuyue did it. After the ‘fall’ of Bazhun’an, their sabers were lost, either broken or lost. Only Gou Wuyue took in The Voice of Nulan, and the Demon Sword, the Voice of Nulan, was willing to acknowledge him as its master. What does this mean?”</p><p>“What’s the situation between the two of them?”</p><p>“..”</p><p>“Uh, I mean, doesn’t Gou Wuyue have his own saber? With their friendship, Gou Wuyue still accepted the Demon Sword, The Voice of Nulan. After that, would he still dare to enter the Holy Divine Palace?”</p><p>“I understand. So it was because of this relationship that Gou Wuyue went easy on him in the battle at the Eighth Palace? He can’t bear to kill him?”</p><p>“No, it’s because of this relationship that the Holy Divine Palace also wanted to see what choice Gou Wuyue would make when he faced Bazhun’an alone. Therefore, they would definitely send very few helpers, and they wanted to force Gou Wuyue to make a choice and not one or two choices.”</p><p>“Uh, they wanted him to die to prove his innocence? How could Gou Wuyue defeat Bazhun’an. He’s very cunning and had already called a large number of people over.”</p><p>“So Gou Wuyue hesitated…Either he fought the enemy to the death, so that no matter what the result was, he would be safe when he returned; Either he leaves the HolyDivine Palace directly, or when this matter is over, he would be subject to a trial, regardless whether he brings your Master back…That’s two different things.”</p><p>‘No wonder Bazhun’an advised him to turn over a new leaf and leave the Holy Divine Palace. Gou Wuyue was also stupid. He should have understood what it meant to have such a vague position. Wasn’t he seeking death? No wonder I heard that he was punished and I haven’t seen him until now.”</p><p>“Do you think this Seven Sword Deity was stupid?”</p><p>“Uh, I don’t dare to. Master, what do you mean?”</p><p>“Do you think Gou Wuyue can’t figure what you can?”</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>“You think that Gou Wuyue didn’t mull over Bazhun’an’s advice?”</p><p>“Oh…”</p><p>“Then you should think about it again. If you had thoughts about it, Gou Wuyue would definitely have the same idea. What was the reason for him to do that?”</p><p>“That’s what I don’t understand. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have asked my Teacher. Hehe!”</p><p>“Foolish! Gou Wuyue’s main cultivation is the Mo Sword Technique. Let me ask you, what are the two major realms of the Mo SwordTechnique?”</p><p>“I know the answer. ‘Green River Sword Boardline’ and ‘Carefreeness’. I’m not a Way of the Sword noob!”</p><p>“Has Gou Wuyue mastered the first realm?”</p><p>“Uh-huh.”</p><p>“Has he mastered the second realm?”</p><p>” I don’t know…”</p><p>“He did not, he’s still in cultivation!”</p><p>“Then I don’t understand. He’s still in the second realm. This has nothing to do with the choice he made in the Eighth Palace. He’s still hesitant and his stance is vague… Is there any connection?”</p><p>“Silly disciple, you have to know that one is not born with knowledge. If one wants to reach the state of ‘no desire’ and ‘reckless’, he first has to have ‘desire’ and ‘scruples’. After he experienced this, then only can he cut off his obsession and cultivate to the second realm!”</p><p>At that time, Xu Xiaoshou was silent.</p><p>This was a conversation he had with his teacher, Mei Siren, on the way to the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had asked other people similar questions, but no one had ever given him such an answer.</p><p>Master Siren was different. He was the first one to point out the problem and trace it to the source. He went straight to the core and gave people a clear solution.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou once again refreshed his understanding of this Big Boss of the world.</p><p>He finally understood why Gou Wuyue had to stay in the Holy Divine Palace even though he was so aggrieved.</p><p>It was because there was pressure from both inside and outside in the Holy Divine Palace. Once one could not withstand it, one’s Way of the Sword would collapse. However, if he could withstand it, he would pass through it.</p><p>The Sainthood was just around the corner!</p><p>Therefore, Xu Xiaoshou put aside the question about Gou Wuyue and turned to ask about the other Sword Deity that he was puzzled about.</p><p>The Seven Sword Deity comprised a total of eight people, and he felt that these two were the weak ones. Now that he had cleared his doubts, Gou Wuyue’s strength and resourcefulness had both soared in his estimation and that left only the last weak one.</p><p>“What about Rao Yaoyao? She was not even as good as Gou Wuyue…How did she manage to get to where she is now?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, are there any fools among the Seven Sword Deity?”</p><p>“Uh, teacher, you’ve already asked me this question…”</p><p>“Then what are you trying to imply?”</p><p>“I want to say that before you came to the Forest of Miracles, Rao Yaoyao had also arrived. Her surname is Rao and she had someone as her support. If she’s not weak, how could she just sit and watch Teng Shanhai die and turn a a blind eye to Demi–Saint Jiang’s actions?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
