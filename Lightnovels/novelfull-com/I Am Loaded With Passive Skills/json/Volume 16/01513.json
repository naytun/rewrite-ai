In an instant, countless White Reborn Lilies bloomed all over the mountain.</p><p>At this moment, it was as if Lei Xi’er had turned into a pure and holy fairy that descended from the sky. With a flip of her hand, she gathered endless divine power and turned it into waves of mental attacks that were visible to the naked eye and directed them toward Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>Outside the battlefield, Greedy the Cat Spirit held half a Dragon Apricot and appeared to watch the battle. It did not know why both its owners were fighting.</p><p>However, it continued to watch the show, while it ate the Dragon Apricot at the same time.</p><p>With its keen senses, it could perceive that there was only a desire for victory in this battle, and no desire to fight to the death.</p><p>“How come my attacks do not have such an effect? Xu Xiaoshou was so envious of the appearance of the blooming Reborn Lilies.</p><p>However, he could not afford to be distracted during a battle, so he didn’t use any extra moves and simply activated his Awakening skill.</p><p>“Freeze ability!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This time, it seemed that the ‘Freeze’ ability was not completely immune to the God Fall’s attack as it exploded in his mind.</p><p>However, at the cost of consuming more than seventy percent of his Spiritual Source, what truly fell on Xu Xiaoshou’s spiritual body barely had the ability to scratch the itch through his shoes.</p><p>“Ha.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused.</p><p>This ‘Freeze’ ability was truly the nemesis of all spiritual attacks!</p><p>Who would have thought that the toughness of this Awakening skill was the perfect interpretation of what ‘passive’ meant!</p><p>The golden light appeared and then disappeared and the damage was reduced by 99%. Xu Xiaoshou’s ‘Transformation’ changed again, which meant that he was not injured. Thus, he moved toward Lei Xi’er’s side again, brandished Hidden Bitter and stabbed her.</p><p>“It’s also ‘immune’?” Lei Xi’er’s pupils trembled. It was simply unbelievable.</p><p>But this time, she was prepared and dodged. She didn’t believe what Xu Xiaoshou said at all. Her divine power was suppressed to the extreme, and the black demonic power in her right eye overflowed.</p><p>“Devil’s Might!”</p><p>The cluster of Reborn Lilies spread all over the mountain turned black at this moment.</p><p>Lei Xi’er, who was wrapped in devilish energy also underwent a Transformation. She became beautiful and beguiling, like a demoness from the Nine Heavens.</p><p>After the pure mental attack was infected with the demonic power, it turned into endless demons that bared their fangs and brandished their claws.</p><p>“Ha, I told you not to use this move. You’ll regret it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s reaction was extremely fast. This time, he didn’t activate the ‘Freeze’ ability. Instead, after his eyelids drooped, they suddenly opened wide again.</p><p>“Heart Sword Technique, Present Gods and Buddhas!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The moment the Devil’s Might devoured Xu Xiaoshou, the world in Lei Xi’er’s eyes was dyed black.</p><p>In the next instant, she saw the Yuan Mansion transform into a world of apocalyptic catastrophes. In this world, there were Nine Heavens thunders, volcanic eruptions, avalanches and tsunamis.</p><p>Against the background of the devilish energy, a 99-story ancient tower rose into the sky. It was the familiar First Pavilion in the Sky!</p><p>However, on the peak of the First Pavilion in the Sky, the person who should have been swallowed by the Devil’s Might suddenly transformed and devoured all the demonic energy into his body that turned into a set of black clothes that fluttered in the wind.</p><p>He stood at the top of the ancient building and only a view of his back was visible. Under the silver moon, he cut a solitary and arrogant figure.</p><p>“What..is this?”</p><p>The shock brought by the scene in front of him was great.</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s God Devil Eyes widened, and her delicate body trembled. She felt as if she had encountered a Saint, and she was almost suppressed by this image.</p><p>When did Xu Xiaoshou master such a terrifying move?</p><p>However, before she could regain her senses, the giant-like figure on the tall building that had such a strong aura, turned his head and opened his eyes slightly.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>It was as if Lei Xi’er had been struck by lightning. She was sent flying by the impact of this gaze, and a mouthful of blood sprayed into the Nine Heavens.</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>Greedy the White Cat Spirit, who was watching the battle, was so scared that the Dragon Apricot dropped from its mouth. It hurriedly scrabbled about with its chubby little front paws before it picked it up again.</p><p>What on earth was going on?</p><p>Was the male owner out to kill the female owner?</p><p>“What is this?” After she adjusted her form in mid-air, Lei Xi’er’s beautiful face looked over in shock.</p><p>“The Heart Sword Technique. You can call it the Devil Sword Technique which I just mastered.” Xu Xiaoshou was secretly delighted. He felt that even when he used the Present Gods and Buddhas to defeat Elder Xie, he had not been as happy as he was now.</p><p>Lei Xi’er was a little angry.</p><p>Before she could figure out where the anger came from, a Loli’s voice rang out in her mind, “Ah! Xu Xiaoshou! You actually dare to use this kind of strength to hit me… beat him up, quickly beat him up!”</p><p>“Don’t be noisy.” Lei Xi’er finally understood that she had been affected.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at the silver-haired woman. After he saw that Lei Xi’er was only slightly affected by the aura attack and wasn’t hurt at the core, he smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I’ve only used a portion of my strength. If I were to add in the cultural deviation attack and not just an aura attack, you would be in an even more miserable state than you are now.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er : “…”</p><p>She didn’t even need to hear the strange yells from the voice in her mind. At this moment, she was really angry. This was the anger at being looked down on!</p><p>“Good, only a portion of your strength, very good…”</p><p>Lei Xi ‘er gritted her teeth, and her pretty face was a little flushed due to the force she used. After a long time, she spat out the words from between her teeth, “Then take this move of mine!”</p><p>Her God Devil Eyes narrowed and opened again. This time, the black and white areas of Lei Xi’er’s eyes seemed to merge and there was no longer any distinction between them. It was as if the divine power and the demonic power had blended perfectly together.</p><p>“?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded.</p><p>“That’s enough, the battle is over, the experiment is completed!’</p><p>He didn’t know how he had offended this lady. Why did she become so angry after they fought for so long?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
