It was the Infernal lineage Holy Blood from Elder Sang, that had no side effects.</p><p>He didn’t give her more because he was afraid that this girl would cause trouble everywhere after she took the Holy Blood. She really would do it!</p><p>He didn’t give her any lesser because he was afraid that if something really happened to her, one drop of Holy Blood would not be enough.</p><p>After all, she was a descendant of the Lei family who had the God Devil Eyes. Even if she didn’t cause any trouble, there would definitely be problems once she left the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was already prepared to clean up his Junior Sister’s mess. He would not let her out of his sight now.</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>The spatial passageway closed, and Xu Xiaoshou saw Master Siren and Xiao Kongtong waiting at the site for him. He waved and greeted them, “Sorry to have kept you waiting, Teacher, Eldest Senior Brother.”</p><p>He had invited the two of them to the Yuan Mansion, but they had declined his invitation.</p><p>The reason was simple. Mei Siren was afraid that if he entered an unstable small world in the Yuan Mansion, he might bring disaster to the small world.</p><p>After all, his true strength was enough to slay a Demi-Saint, and the aura he exuded could even influence or change the ‘Path’ of a newly-born small world. This was not beneficial to the development of the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>Although Xu Xiaoshou believed that his Yuan Mansion was strong enough to withstand the might of a Demi-Saint, Mei Siren didn’t want to take the risk.</p><p>He couldn’t afford to let anything happen.</p><p>As for Xiao Kongtong…</p><p>This man was extremely interested in the Yuan Mansion. After all, even he hadn’t managed to obtain one yet.</p><p>He had collected the abandoned Yuan Mansion before for research purposes. However, without those two prerequisites, it was impossible to activate it.</p><p>A Spirit Array Master could be found, but a Spirit Array Master proficient in the Spatial Path was as rare as Spiritual Cultivators with Space Attributes.</p><p>And for Spiritual Cultivators with Space Attributes, in this world, Xiao Kongtong only knew of three names.</p><p>Originally, he was very interested and wanted to enter Xu Xiaoshou’s Yuan Mansion to broaden his horizon.</p><p>However, after a glance from Mei Siren, he had also declined the invitation. Indeed, what if something happened?</p><p>It would be better if there were less trouble, so he obediently followed Master Siren and waited outside until now.</p><p>“You’re the Eldest Senior Brother from the Fringe Moon Immortal City?”</p><p>The two people waiting outside were a little surprised that Xu Xiaoshou had brought out such a young lady from the Yuan Mansion. However, before they could ask anything, Mu Zixi had already viewed Xiao Kongtong with curiosity and enthusiasm and fired a series of questions at him,</p><p>“I heard you’re Bazhun’an… Uh… is that the registered disciple of the Eighth Sword Deity or an anonymous disciple? No matter, that is the only one, right?”</p><p>“How did you two meet? Have you seen him before? I’ve seen him before!”</p><p>“What’s in your sack? This gunny sack doesn’t look very good. I’ll make one for you, the kind that’s made of twigs and is very tough. In exchange, can you show me the contents inside?”</p><p>“By the way, do you know Sword Cognition? It’s something like the ‘Penetrating Divine Senses’ and is a very high-level skill, so you should know about it, right?”</p><p>“Fringe Moon Immortal City… Oh, is there a moon that you guys worship? That sounds cool.”</p><p>“I read from a book that there were tens of thousands of ancient Ancient Swordsmen in the Fringe Moon Immortal City. All of them were very powerful. But didn’t they become extinct?”</p><p>“Your entire counties and cities in the Fringe Moon Immortal City, are as big as the world? Is it really as big as the Eastern Sky Realm or is that a mere exaggeration?”</p><p>“The Eastern Sky Realm. There are so many people in the Dongtianwang City… Is the Eastern Moon Realm really ruled by you alone? It’s been renamed Fringe Moon Immortal City?”</p><p>“..”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was stunned.</p><p>Where did this little girl come from and why did she have so many questions?</p><p>He didn’t respond and looked at Xu Xiaoshou in shock.</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou facepalmed himself. “It’s my fault…”</p><p>When he was in the Yuan Mansion, he had enlightened his little Junior Sister about the general situation of the outside world. Of course, he also introduced Mei Siren and Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>However, he no longer took Xiao Kongtong as an unfathomable great senior. Instead, after he met him in the Deep Sea World with Water Ghost, he regarded him as the big mouth of the Fringe Moon Immortal City.</p><p>Thus, Mu Zixi’s sense of respect and fear also seemed to have vanished thereafter.</p><p>Mu Zixi was curious about the Eldest Senior Brother of the Fringe Moon Immortal City. He was a big Boss who was featured in books and was the main character of all kinds of stories and legends while he was still alive. As soon as he appeared, Mu Zixi’s curiosity finally transformed into 100000 ‘why’s…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was also rather curious about most of the questions she asked.</p><p>“This is Master Siren, whom you’ve met before, Elder Mei.” However, Xu Xiaoshou had already realized that something was wrong. He quickly pulled his Junior Sister and introduced her to another person.</p><p>“Greetings, Elder Mei.” The little girl obediently bowed.</p><p>She did not dare to act rashly in front of the guest of the First Pavilion in the Sky, one of the Seven Sword Deity recognized by the Five Domains of the continent, and the big Boss, who, according to Xu Xiaoshou, had killed the Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi.</p><p>“Mu Zixi?” Mei Siren smiled. It was obvious that he still remembered such a lovely girl.</p><p>“Oh…” Mu Zixi cowered and looked at Xu Xiaoshou timidly. She was a little embarrassed to speak.</p><p>“Actually, her name is Mu Zixi. Mu Zixi is just an alias.” Xu Xiaoshou said with a smile. He didn’t think it was a big deal.</p><p>Mu Zixi…It was only when Xiao Kongtong heard her name that he recalled something. He said, “You’re Elder Sleeveless’s second disciple?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
