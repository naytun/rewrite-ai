(1)</p><p>The entire hall became deathly silent.</p><p>The “Sky Three” cell was actually a side hall. Like the other cells, it had a heavy and majestic palace door. Outside the door, there was a cold fence made of an unknown ore, firmly sealing everything inside.</p><p>However, at this moment, the fence, like the huge torture device on the other side, had an additional aura of decay, wilting, and death, as if it was affected by Ye Xiao’s aura of death.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>In the time it took for him to turn around, the fence had cracked open, and a piece of it fell to the ground as if some seal had been broken.</p><p>“Hey, hey, hey…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s scalp went numb. This d*mn place was called the “Hall of Unforgivable Crimes”. One could imagine what kind of unpardonable people were locked up in the cell of “Sky Three”.</p><p>He was able to foresee this kind of unknown time… It was possible that if the monster that had been sealed in the prison since ancient times were to escape now, it would bring about a terrible disaster.</p><p>“Why aren’t you withdrawing your divine ability?” Xu Xiaoshou turned to look at Ye Xiao. It was all her fault!</p><p>Ye Xiao was obviously shocked as well. Chen Tan might not be able to cause much trouble, but if an unknown existence was released, then even she might not be able to escape.</p><p>Not only her, but the worst case scenario was that the entire Hall of Unforgivable Crimes, and even the structure of the hall, might undergo a huge change.</p><p>After all, who could be sure that the prisoner in the hall was not a demi-saint from ancient times?</p><p>“Stop,”</p><p>Nightingale quickly raised her hand, and the power of the death god that was spreading in the hall stopped. In the next second, it was all retracted back into her body.</p><p>However, it was all too late…</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The sealing fence outside Sky Three’s cell cracked open again, and a large piece fell off. This time, a big hole in the seal became clearly visible.</p><p>“Chi…”</p><p>Frosty white cold air slowly seeped out from the hole.</p><p>Not long after, the ground outside Sky Three’s cell was frozen into ice crystals.</p><p>The cracking sound was endless. The cold air had a purpose. As soon as the seal was broken, it went around the bars of the cell first.</p><p>It was conceivable that if the fence was completely frozen and broken, the unknown existence inside would probably push open the door of Sky Three… The whole situation was at its fingertips.</p><p>“Stop him.” Nightingale suddenly looked back at him. Her voice was cold as if she was ordering her subordinates to do something that was only natural.</p><p>“Are you crazy?” Xu Xiaoshou spread his hands and with an exasperated expression, he exaggerated, “How can I stop him? Am I supposed to use my life to stop it? You’re the one who made this mess, so you have to clean it up. Do you really think that this Hall is your Secret Department and that I have to listen to you? In the Southern Region, I’ve never heard of a single order from the Holy Divine Palace!”</p><p>Ye Xiao’s face turned cold. She didn’t expect that two simple words could be exchanged for such a long rebuttal.</p><p>However, there was not much time. The current situation did not allow her to reprimand Chen Tan, this impolite person, hence she quickly moved.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>The necromancer pointed with her scepter, and a thick ray of light containing the will of extermination fell from the sky. It carried the power of the death god and blasted directly at the frosty white air that was trying to freeze the sealing fence.</p><p>No matter what level this power was at, with the “withering” and “extinction” abilities attached to the power of death, it should be able to annihilate it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. He felt that the energy contained in this spiritual attack from the scepter was really terrifying. He didn’t know if Acalanātha could take it.</p><p>Well, even if he couldn’t block it, Ye Xiao would still suffer the same amount of damage from the backlash, and he could trigger ‘Spirit Awakening’ with a backhand and then stab her with ‘Disillusionment Finger’…</p><p>It was obviously not the time to think about this.</p><p>Seeing that the necromancer’s light of Quietus was about to hit the frosty white air, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly had an idea.</p><p>“Wait…”</p><p>He subconsciously wanted to shout ‘stop’ because he thought of a terrifying possibility.</p><p>However, it was too late. The light of Quietus was extremely fast and instantly enveloped all the frosty white air outside Sky Three’s cell.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>With a loud explosion, Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded as he watched the moment before Ye Xiao’s attack arrived. The thick frosty white cold air was as scheming as he had expected, retreating back into the cell from the hole in the seal.</p><p>This caused Ye Xiao’s attack, which contained all the energy of the death God’s power, to pour onto the sealing fence without any mistake.</p><p>“Is your brain filled with paste?!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was so angry that he started to curse. “If you use your brain, you should know the consequences of that thing taking back its power. Are you stupid?”</p><p>Ye Xiao was stunned, not because she was scolded by Xu Xiaoshou, but because… Normal people wouldn’t have thought of this development, right? Shouldn’t they be trying their best to resist and test each other’s combat power?</p><p>“Since you’re so smart, you do it.” She looked at him coldly. After a moment of shock, she was filled with anger.</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>The internal strife in the hall seemed to have amused the existence in Sky Three’s cell, and it let out a burst of high-pitched and strange laughter.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but shiver. This was the kind of evil laughter that sounded like it came from fingernails scratching the blackboard, which was even more intolerable than Elder Qiao’s.</p><p>“Brat, it seems that you’re really cunning too. You actually predicted my thoughts.”</p><p>After the laughter, a mocking voice came from Sky Three’s cell, “I’m sure that you and I are the same kind of person… Come, help me break this seal, and you’ll follow me from now on!”</p><p>Thump!</p><p>He didn’t even need to help. After all, Ye Xiao’s previous attack had rotted another large piece of the sealing fence.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
