Don’t interfere and of course, you can’t stop me from leaving.”</p><p>“As for the future…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tilted his head and looked in the direction of the cell door. The image of Ye Xiao who had been in the same position when he first entered the Hall, flashed through his mind.</p><p>The other party was already on her guard, but he only realized it later.</p><p>Fortunately, he had taken the initiative and didn’t make a big mistake in the end.</p><p>He sighed and shook his head. “Who knows what will happen in the future?”</p><p>If it was possible, a smart person like Chen Tan would have sent out the God Execution Order as well to escape from the center of the vortex.</p><p>But it was a pity.</p><p>Chen Tan was not Chen Tan, he was just Xu Xiaoshou’s avatar.</p><p>Wasn’t giving the God Execution Order to the Holy Divine Palace just creating a great enemy for himself in the future?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had a premonition that even if the three God Execution Orders really fell into the hands of the Holy Divine Palace, Bazhun’an would not let the matter rest.</p><p>There was a high chance that he would enter the Ran Ming ruins after he stepped into the Four Symbols Secret Realm, just like how he had inexplicably wandered to the Abyss Island after he entered the Imperial City Trial.</p><p>“Wouldn’t it be better if he didn’t enter the Four Symbols Secret Realm?”</p><p>Ha! How naive of him!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had long passed the age where he would have such naive thoughts.</p><p>He had now understood a principle-in the martial arts world, one cannot act on their own will.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>On the shoulder of the Necromancer, Ye Xiao nodded slightly and gathered all the power in her body.</p><p>However, none of them disappeared. It was as if they were waiting for the arrival of a variable.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded in approval. Smart people still had their own ways of playing.</p><p>Since they couldn’t do anything to each other, it would be a good choice to take a break and recuperate.</p><p>After he left the cell, Xu Xiaoshou wandered around and was not afraid that Ye Xiao would launch a sudden attack.</p><p>Even if he didn’t warn Ye Xiao, he knew that with Ye Xiao’s cautious nature, she would definitely have left a backup plan on the Spiritual Array seal.</p><p>Even if there was a slight mistake, the seal would be removed.</p><p>After having been unsealed for so many times, perhaps Elder Han would really be able to escape.</p><p>At that time, the one who would die a miserable death would not necessarily be Chen Tan, but Ye Xiao, who belonged to the Holy Divine Palace and would definitely not be able to survive under the hands of a Demi-Saint, even if she had mastered the power of the God of Death.</p><p>“Da…da…da…”</p><p>The sound of footsteps was like an intangible clock that ticked away every minute.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had almost walked through the entire Hall of Unforgivable Crimes and his ‘Perception’ had searched every dead-end corner no less than ten times, but he still couldn’t find the exit.</p><p>The Inner hall, the Outer Hall, and the place where they first landed…</p><p>In this completely sealed off Hall of Unforgivable Crimes, it seemed that there really were no windows for any prisoners to escape.</p><p>He searched for an entire day.</p><p>The palace doors couldn’t be pushed open, and the passageway couldn’t be found.</p><p>Even if they used sharp blades to cut the space, the space here was tough and solid. It couldn’t be cut through via any normal means. Even if they could, the spatial storm was more than ten thousand times more terrifying than the outside world!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou secretly sent a portrait clone to test the power. Of course, this was disguised as some kind of evil and spiritual technique from the Southern Region.</p><p>As a result, the portrait clone shattered the moment it entered the spatial fragment.</p><p>The test showed that those who didn’t have the strength of a Demi-Saint didn’t need to think about leaving the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes through the spatial fragment.</p><p>“Wow…”</p><p>Ye Xiao had already landed on the giant table in the main hall from the Necromancer’s shoulder.</p><p>Her feet were suspended in the air and swayed gently like a willow branch in the night wind. Her upper body leaned forward slightly, with half of her face hidden in the shadow of the hood, and her fingers were interlocked as they supported her fair chin. Just like that, she quietly watched Chen Tan, who had been busy the whole day.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>The three-legged Black Owl on her shoulder looked curiously at the Spiritual Array that replaced the God Execution Order. Then, as if it had seen something complicated, its eyes became dazed, and it raised its head to scream.</p><p>Magpies represented blessings, while crows signified misfortune.</p><p>In fact, there was no such thing as a bird of fortune or a bird of disaster. It was just that the latter had a higher spiritual quality and could sense the arrival of some unknown variables and served as a reminder to people to make a decision quickly.</p><p>However, when the crows cawed, there were often no good news.</p><p>As time passed, people attributed the disasters to them and regarded them as ‘ominous birds’ or the ‘reincarnation of the God of Death’.</p><p>Ye Xiao who had been silent for the whole night, also moved with the cries of the black Owl on her shoulder.</p><p>She released her hands and looked up at the ceiling of the Great Hall. Her gaze pierced through the darkness as if she had seen the future.</p><p>“Chen Tan.”</p><p>After a long while, Ye Xiao jumped down from the table and landed on the shoulder of the Necromancer. She stopped Chen Tan, who was still busy and refused to give up, and said, “Actually, you have another option.”</p><p>“Thank you, but no thanks.” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even turn his head.</p><p>“This is my last advice.”</p><p>“Thank you, but we’re not compatible.”</p><p>Ye Xiao lowered her head, and the darkness under her hood hid all her expressions. She stopped trying to persuade him and waited quietly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also stopped.</p><p>He couldn’t find a way out even though he searched for a whole day.</p><p>He could either break the seal on Elder Han and let him take him away; The other option was to wait for any variable change, just like the spatial disorder in the First Hall of Sins. There would probably be a next time, and that would be his chance.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was afraid of death, so he chose the latter and placed his bet on an unknown possibility.</p><p>And now, the variable was here!</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>Accompanied by a deafening sound, a huge gap suddenly appeared in the void outside the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes, where the huge instruments of torture were displayed.</p><p>The space was chaotic and overlapping, and lights and shadows flickered rapidly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was prepared, saw many scenes that he didn’t notice before.</p><p>There were the bodies of Spiritual Cultivators lying in pools of blood, a group of tall Void Attendants who chased after something, and a Great Hall that had been silent since ancient times…</p><p>Everything was there!</p><p>But everything was blurry.</p><p>Finally, the space froze.</p><p>Above the crack in the void, a tunnel that belonged to the labyrinth of the First Hall of Sins extended out. It was surrounded by walls, and a cross-section of the tunnel had been cut off and left in this space.</p><p>“This is my chance!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes flickered. He was about to rush into the passage and return to the First Hall of Sins to look for Master Siren and his little Junior Sister.</p><p>The next second.</p><p>“Da!”</p><p>The sound of footsteps resounded from the passage.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly stopped, and his Spiritual Will instantly poured down like ice water.</p><p>Ye Xiao was still standing on top of the Necromancer with her eyes lowered. She didn’t look at the person in the tunnel at all. It was as if she didn’t care who it was.</p><p>“Bang Bang…”</p><p>“Bang Bang…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his heartbeat suddenly accelerate.</p><p>Who could it be?</p><p>The enemy?</p><p>Ally?</p><p>However, he only had one chance. No matter who was teleported here due to the spatial disorder, he had to get out of this one and only passageway.</p><p>If he didn’t, he wouldn’t have another chance.</p><p>The death countdown would not wait for anyone!</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>With this thought, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly rushed into the passage.</p><p>At the same time, Ye Xiao who stood on top of the Necromancer, suddenly raised her head.</p><p>She kept her promise and did not stop Chen Tan from leaving. However, when she looked up, the gloominess was no longer there. Under the dim light, the corners of her lips were slightly raised and formed an enchanting bow.</p><p>The three-legged Black Owl screeched in fear and flapped its wings.</p><p>“Swish!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
