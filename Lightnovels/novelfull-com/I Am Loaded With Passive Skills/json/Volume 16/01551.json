Although these two attributes are already very unusual, Ye Xiao’s attributes are definitely not either of them!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized what was special about Ye Xiao. This woman either didn’t attack or once she did, she would make sure that she kill the target.</p><p>She was the type of person he hated the most. The type that didn’t follow common sense and couldn’t be fooled at all!</p><p>“Acalanātha.”</p><p>In a split second, Xu Xiaoshou’s body emitted a faint golden light, which nullified the spiritual attack of the two three-legged black owls.</p><p>If he was an average person, he would have been interrupted by the terrifying sound of the undead when Ye Xiao decided to use her real power and summoned the “Land of Dark Night”.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou’s “Spiritual Awakening” was constantly triggered, hence he could always remain clear-headed and calm.</p><p>“This can be immune?”</p><p>The two three-legged black owls passed through the soul as if they were going through cotton.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was overjoyed. He understood that this was not an attack. Perhaps it was just an ability that Ye Xiao used to control and influence people’s minds.</p><p>Before he could do anything, Ye Xiao, who had summoned the Grand Mage of death with the aura of “martial virtue”, had already spoken coldly.</p><p>“Give it to me,”</p><p>These words were like Yama’s judgment and of course, she was referring to the God-execution token.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou’s spirit was attacked by the three-legged Black Owls, his will would probably be taken away, and he would listen to Ye Xiao completely.</p><p>“Oh…” His eyes immediately blurred, and he couldn’t help but move forward in a daze, wanting to hand over the “God-execution token”.</p><p>One, two, three…</p><p>As he approached Ye Xiao, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly attacked.</p><p>His entire body emitted an evil purple light as if an evil god possessed him. With a flip of his hand, he grabbed a “Cursed Yin Eye”, which was thicker than a human head, and fiercely slapped it toward Ye Xiao’s cold and delicate face.</p><p>“You want it? Then I’ll give it to you!”</p><p>With an explosive bang, the violent impact of the Cursed Yin Eye was clearly unexpected.</p><p>Ye Xiao also seemed to have not recovered from the fact that Chen Tan was not in a controlled state. Her beautiful face was immediately smashed by a slap, and the purple-glowing “Cursed Yin Eye” was embedded.</p><p>“Chi Chi…”</p><p>A strange purple evil energy scattered in all directions.</p><p>This was the power of the evil god, and even if it was just an aura, its level was probably not inferior to any form that Ye Xiao had summoned.</p><p>Almost in an instant, the purple energy that represented the Evil God’s aura filled Ye Xiao’s entire body.</p><p>The turbulent evil energy churned, and Ye Xiao was like a black leather ball filled with purple pus, about to explode.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The ball finally exploded!</p><p>However, the expected scene of brilliant purple light and Ye Xiao’s cultivation deviation did not appear.</p><p>After the Dark Division Chief exploded, her body turned into an illusory three-legged Black Owl, flapping its wings and shrieking as it flew onto the death mage’s shoulder, turning back into the real Ye Xiao.</p><p>“Suspected. Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Glared angrily. Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Locked. Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The information bar instantly started jumping.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked up and saw Ye Xiao’s frightened face. He grinned and said, “Chief Ye Xiao, why don’t you want it anymore? Snatching this thing off my hand is very easy, after all, I’m just an ordinary person, while you’re high and mighty. You can take whatever you want.”</p><p>“Watched, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Unexpectedly, Ye Xiao’s expression calmed down, and even her “angry glare” turned into a “stare”.</p><p>This was an enemy who could control her emotions. Goading her was useless, and she was simply difficult to deal with… Xu Xiaoshou was a little irritated.</p><p>“How did you dodge my attack?” On the death mage’s shoulder, Ye Xiao stood like the three-legged Black Owl.</p><p>“Ha!” Xu Xiaoshou’s lips curled into a mocking smile. “Miss Ye Xiao, do you really think that the 16th generation of Qingjing Sect’s sole heir is a pushover? Our sect cultivates the ‘peace and inaction, equality of the world’. Such underhanded means like yours will never corrupt my soul!”</p><p>Even though Ye Xiao rarely had big emotional fluctuations in her life, at this moment, she could not help but have her eyes dimmed, and her face was stunned.</p><p>Peace and inaction, equality in the world?</p><p>She thought of the faint golden light that Chen Tan’s body emitted just now. Was he talking about this?</p><p>However, in the next second, everything in Ye Xiao’s mind was filled up by the Cursed Yin Eye, which was ten thousand times more evil than her own and would be embedded into her human face even if she died.</p><p>He called this “peace”?</p><p>Who was more ‘sinister’ than who?</p><p>She thought, “Your sect has such a lofty ideal of ‘peace and inaction, equality of the world’, and the disciples of your sect only practice these ‘peaceful’ moves?”</p><p>“Swish-”</p><p>The three-legged Black Owl on her shoulder suddenly raised its head and cawed, as if it was mocking her.</p><p>Ye Xiao’s expression also immediately returned to being calm and stopped mocking him.</p><p>After exchanging blows with him just now, she concluded her previous thoughts that Chen Tan was not an ordinary person.</p><p>Even if she had never heard of the Qingjing sect, and even if there was no information about the higher void of the southern region, there was no mention of a person like Chen Tan.</p><p>However, just the appearance of the aura of the evil god was enough for Ye Xiao to conclude that Chen Tan was extraordinary.</p><p>The power of his spiritual technique seemed to be very small, probably barely enough to reach the output of a Sovereign Dao Realm expert. However, he was still very powerful.</p><p>It seemed that this person was as cautious as she was. They were both afraid of the unknown of the hall of no pardon and also on guard against their opponents. Therefore, they only used a small amount of power to test each other.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
