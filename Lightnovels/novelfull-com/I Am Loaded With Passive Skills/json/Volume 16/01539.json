Roar…Roar?”</p><p>Mu Zixi was also shocked. The Demi-Saint’s pressure, the Sword Image…</p><p>The details were as realistic as a fantasy realm, and the restored scene perfectly matched the battle in the Forest of Miracles that Xu Xiaoshou had described to her in the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>Just from this fantasy realm alone, she caught a glimpse of the magnificence of the battle at that time.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had dared to play tricks and make fun of the Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi in the presence of all these people?</p><p>He must have eaten a bear’s heart and a leopard’s gall! What if he had died?</p><p>“+(Cursed. Passive Points +1,+1,+1,+1)”</p><p>Amid the clatter of footsteps, Xu Xiaoshou appeared in front of the dark Void Attendant, who trembled and knelt on the ground.</p><p>He only had a serious look in his eyes and did not require Mei Siren’s help to increase his aura. The imagery of the Sword God of the Heart Sword Technique of the present Gods and Buddhas was only the tip of the iceberg. In the eyes of the Void Attendant, he had become the unattainable ‘Void General’.</p><p>“Be good. Nothing bad will happen if you don’t mess around.” Xu Xiaoshou said in the language of the Giant Clan.</p><p>“Roar?” The Void Attendant was stunned. “You would…”</p><p>“I’ll ask the questions, you answer.”</p><p>“Roar, Roar.”</p><p>“Do you know what a ‘Death Exemption Token’ is?”</p><p>“I know…”</p><p>“Where is it?”</p><p>“The main Hall…” The Void Attendant did not dare to resist. It already understood that this ‘giant’ was not the strongest. The companion behind him was stronger.</p><p>Under such circumstances, the price of resistance was death, and all information would definitely be extracted.</p><p>Rather than that, it was better to compromise now. If they could escape later, he would call his brothers to capture them all in one go.</p><p>“The main Hall?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could already visualize the ‘big’ in the First Hall of Sins from the ‘small’ of this labyrinth. Perhaps this should not be known as ‘to see the whole from a small part’ but rather ‘to see the width from the whole’!”</p><p>According to what the Void Attendant said, if there was a main Hall, then the First Hall of Sins must have side halls and so on?</p><p>“How do we get to the main Hall?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“Follow the Guidance of the heart…”</p><p>“Heart?”</p><p>“It is the Guidance of the ‘Spirit of the Heavenly Ancestor’…”</p><p>This unfamiliar term startled Xu Xiaoshou, but he soon recalled the first time he met the Void Attendant, when the guy gave him a mission.</p><p>These Void Attendants also seemed to rely on the mission instructions in their minds to carry out their actions…</p><p>In that case, this ‘Spirit of the Heavenly Ancestor’ should be the source of all the instructions, which was also the ‘Spirit of the Abyss Island’?</p><p>“Who is that?” Xu Xiaoshou asked as if he did not understand.</p><p>Who would have thought that his question would anger the Void Attendant?</p><p>The dark Void Attendant glared at him, as if it wanted to teach this rude fellow a lesson. However, its eyes swept past the three great beings behind him, and one of them had the aura of a Void General.</p><p>The Void Attendant restrained himself…</p><p>“He is the highest existence in our race. He is the Supreme Ruler above the generals. He is the eternal God of the Void Tribe!”</p><p>After a pause, the Void Attendant’s tone became reverent.</p><p>“Our God has never fallen!”</p><p>“He merely changed his style of existence to continue to protect the Void Tribe.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou understood that the Void Tribe was what the Giant Race called themselves. The Void Attendant’s words also confirmed his speculation.</p><p>The Spirit of the Heavenly Ancestor was the Spirit of the Abyss Island!</p><p>“Heavenly Ancestor…” Xu Xiaoshou stopped his speculation and continued to ask, “Without the guidance of the ‘Spirit of the Heavenly Ancestor’, how do I go to the main Hall of the First Hall of Sins?”</p><p>“You should know when to turn back if you lose your way. Leave the First Hall of Sins immediately. Without the Guidance of the Heavenly Ancestor’s Spirit, you will be lost here forever.” The Void Attendant said coldly.</p><p>“I don’t believe you.” Xu Xiaoshou shook his head.</p><p>“Uh…” The Void Attendant suddenly seemed to choke.</p><p>“You must have other methods.”</p><p>“No, I only follow the Guidance of the heart…”</p><p>The Void Attendant was being truthful. Xu Xiaoshou asked a few more questions and even tried various methods to trick and mislead it. This big guy really did not have any other way to go to the main Hall.</p><p>All the answers boiled down to the fact that one needed the Guidance of the Heavenly Ancestor’s Spirit to go to the main Hall. Otherwise, one would only get lost in this huge labyrinth.</p><p>“How many Void Crystals do I need to exchange for a Death Exemption Token?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could only change the topic.</p><p>“I don’t know. It used to be ten or thirty Void Crystals…”</p><p>In the past?</p><p>The price of the Death Exemption Token would even increase?</p><p>“In the past? How long ago was that?”</p><p>This question seemed to stump the Void Attendant. It pondered for a long time before it replied with uncertainty, “A few thousand years ago? These are the problems that sinners should be concerned about.”</p><p>“…” Xu Xiaoshou changed the topic. “How many Void Crystals do you have on you?”</p><p>“Ah?” The Void Attendant was stunned.</p><p>“I’m buying your life. Give me the Void Crystals and you can leave. I won’t kill you. I’m a good friend of the Void race and I’ve always been.” Xu Xiaoshou’s expression was sincere and solemn.</p><p>The Void Attendant endured this time and again. In the end, in utter humiliation, it finally took out 34 Void Crystals and offered them with both hands.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou unceremoniously took them all and wanted to get more.</p><p>However, the Void Attendant was very honest. He had already taken out all his entire wealth and could not squeeze out anything more.</p><p>When he waved his hand to let them go, the huge dark giant turned away with a rumble and left. It did not show any reluctance to leave and did not even try to fight back.</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou felt that this situation was unbelievable. Such a huge monster had been driven away so quickly with Master Siren’s help.</p><p>With the support of this big Boss, the trip to the First Hall of Sins was much safer than he had imagined!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
