He was about to put the Five Decays of Heaven and Man to the test.</p><p>This question was also an indication of Xu Xiaoshou’s self doubt that his true identity might have been exposed.</p><p>However, what he still didn’t understand was if the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had recognized him as Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>However, there had never been any interaction between Xu Xiaoshou and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man!</p><p>How could there be someone who would risk his life for a stranger?</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man turned around and seemed amused. The rusty nail on his forehead had not been pulled out, but there was no blood. “You can just take it as such.”</p><p>But I can’t!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was puzzled. He believed that with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s IQ, he should understand the underlying meaning of his words.</p><p>But why did he give such a soul-searching and ambiguous answer?</p><p>This wretch… Xu Xiaoshou frantically tried to recall if he had met Yama’s Five Decays of Heaven and Man at some point in the past, or if he had inadvertently saved his life.</p><p>But he had not!</p><p>The result of the memory search was that he first met the Five Decays of Heaven and Man in the labyrinth of the First Hall of Sins, not long ago.</p><p>The Xu Xiaoshou of old used to be super confident.</p><p>He could even vaguely control Bazhun’an’s thoughts. He could even arrange a cooperation without leaving any traces and became a reusable chess piece.</p><p>Now, Xu Xiaoshou realized that for the first time, he couldn’t figure out a person’s intentions.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was too mysterious.</p><p>In his presence… he became Xu Xiaoshou, and he himself became the one who would always be dallied with by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Senior!”</p><p>As he watched the person in front of him walk away gradually, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but shout, “Actually, I’m not Chen Ruye from the Xu Yue Grey Palace. I killed him and took his place. You’ve got the wrong person.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was in his mouth, but he pretended to be calm.</p><p>He watched as the orange-masked man slowly turned around. When he turned back, his eyes were still calm, without the slightest ripple of emotion in them.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Did he make up an excuse for himself?</p><p>He knew everything?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t understand and continued, “Actually, I’m… the only heir of the 16th generation of the Qingjing sect, Chen Tan! You must have heard heard Ye Xiao call out my real name before she died.”</p><p>Even though he had decided to reveal his identity, Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to reveal it completely.</p><p>He was still afraid.</p><p>The power of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was too terrifying.</p><p>What if his guess was wrong, and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was really a simple-minded chap?</p><p>What if he saw the real Xu Xiaoshou and remembered the grudge between Yama and the Saint Servant and chose to attack?</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was still calm. He didn’t even say a word and just looked at Chen Ruye quietly… Oh, Chen Tan. There was a hint of playfulness in his eyes.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his hair stand on end from being stared at. He couldn’t guess what the other party’s thoughts were at all.</p><p>“Aren’t you going to say anything?” Xu Xiaoshou said.</p><p>“You’re Chen Tan?”</p><p>“Right! My name is Chen Tan, not Chen Ruye… I actually have no relationship with the Xu Yue Grey Palace at all! I’m sorry, you’ve helped the wrong person!” Xu Xiaoshou said fearlessly.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man said softly as he reached out his hand.</p><p>“I don’t care if you’re called Chen Tan or Chen Ruye.”</p><p>“You only need to know that a person called Five Decays of Heaven and Man saved your life today. That’s enough.”</p><p>“In the future, others can stop him, but you can’t. If you do this, you’ll be repaying kindness with ingratitude.”</p><p>“Of course, you can also be a person who repays kindness with ingratitude…”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man seemed to have thought of something and turned away with a smile.</p><p>His form faded away step by step, and the space-time world around him also gradually disintegrated.</p><p>All that was left was the ethereal voice. Bit by bit, it drifted like rain into the ears of the stunned young figure who stood some distance way.</p><p>“But you must remember that you will be punished for all the bad things you have done.”</p><p>“Karma, reincarnation, grudges, deceit, lies… Heh, you will be punished for everything.”</p><p>“This world is relative.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
