One after another, it was a terrifying and strange sight.</p><p>“Holy Power!”</p><p>Floating above the Blood World, the golden-haired Yan Wuse suddenly turned his head and looked in the direction he had come from. His voice was filled with surprise.</p><p>“You’re right, it’s the Holy Power.”</p><p>Number two, who was taller than ordinary people and seemed to fit the size of this giant kingdom better, said emotionlessly, ”</p><p>“Including this one and the one I sensed when we got close to the Forest of Miracles, there are now two Demi-saint’s Powers on Abyss Island.</p><p>“That is Jiang Buyi.” Yan Wuse said with absolute certainty.</p><p>After entering the Blood World, he could already sense that the ultimate attribute of the Forest of Miracles in the distance had been activated. A great battle at the level of demi-saints had once erupted there.</p><p>He wondered who dared to provoke a demi-saint…</p><p>However, Yan Wuse felt that there was a higher possibility that Jiang Buyi had set his eyes on the “core” of the Forest of Miracles.</p><p>If that was the case, the Pu Xuan Jiang Clan of the Northern Region would cease to exist!</p><p>“Jiang Buyi, you are not that reckless.” The light of heaven’s secrets flickered in Number Two’s eyes. He had calculated that the possibility of Jiang Buyi targeting the “core” of the Forest of Miracles was almost zero.</p><p>“Maybe you’re right, but the most important thing now is…”</p><p>Yan Wuse turned his head and no longer thought about anything else. Instead, he stared at the seven blood tree phantoms at the center of the Blood World.</p><p>His expression turned grave, and his tone was filled with killing intent.</p><p>“No wonder the spatial passageway of Fallen Abyss is in chaos.”</p><p>“Who dared to steal the Blood World Pearl?”</p><p>…</p><p>“Achoo!”</p><p>At the entrance of the First Hall of Sins, Reverend Huang Yang suddenly sneezed and retreated from the blurry world of blood that he had just seen.</p><p>“How strange…”</p><p>He rubbed his nose, took a deep breath, and frowned.</p><p>Just now, following his spiritual intuition, he walked all the way here. When he woke up again, he had already arrived at the entrance of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>This was undoubtedly horrifying and strange!</p><p>Because before this, Reverend Huang Yang didn’t even know what the First Hall of Sins was and where it was.</p><p>However, just as he regained consciousness, he had already arrived at his destination – the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>As for what had happened in the middle, Reverend Huang Yang had almost forgotten everything.</p><p>He couldn’t remember at all. He only felt that he had just been possessed, and that sneeze had found him back.</p><p>“Is it a sudden impulse?”</p><p>After mumbling to himself, Reverend Huang Yang’s mind was already restless.</p><p>If he could, he wanted to leave Abyss Island right now. However, he did not even know where to go.</p><p>“Speaking of which, it’s strange that Elder Xie and Ghost Granny didn’t chase after me!</p><p>“Judging from the greedy nature of the assassins, I’ve already made preparations to defend against the assassination from an unknown place. They shouldn’t be satisfied with the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch.</p><p>“Yes, it’s too strange. It’s strange for no reason.”</p><p>Reverend Huang Yang rubbed his chin and stood under the plaque with the words First Hall of Sins, unable to move for a long time.</p><p>At a higher void level, he was not unfamiliar with the feeling of being plotted by others. However, with the reminder of his whim, he could always turn danger into safety as long as he responded well every time.</p><p>But this time, Reverend Huang Yang felt that even his impulse to turn danger into safety was about to be wiped out.</p><p>This strange feeling was not only reflected in the feeling of almost losing his memory of the journey here, but also not in the situation where Elder Xie and Ghost Granny did not pursue him.</p><p>It was more like…</p><p>Intuition!</p><p>His intuition that something was strange about him!</p><p>As soon as he put down the horsetail whisk, Reverend Huang Yang felt that he could not continue to go down for no reason.</p><p>He formed a hand seal and began to chant the Heart Clearing Incantation. He observed himself and tried to find the source of his own strangeness.</p><p>His spirit, soul, and even his will seemed to have been drawn out, and he began to examine his physical body from a second perspective. Soon, Reverend Huang Yang discovered the abnormality in his body.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>After his consciousness returned to his body, Reverend Huang Yang took out a blood-red pearl.</p><p>He had obtained this Blood Pearl in the Blood World. Before he obtained this Blood Pearl, he had been living a normal life of pursuing the Great Path in the higher void level. There was nothing strange about it.</p><p>However, after obtaining this Blood Pearl, the trajectory of fate seemed to have started to change.</p><p>“Is it because of you?”</p><p>Subconsciously, Reverend Huang Yang wanted to throw away this treasure that he himself didn’t even know the use of.</p><p>For him to be able to live until now and grow to this point in the way of cultivation, his greatest life-saving ability was to seek good fortune and avoid disaster.</p><p>After silently observing his true self, the answer he obtained through his spiritual intuition was to throw away this Blood Pearl and leave immediately, even if he was very reluctant!</p><p>However…</p><p>“Death countdown: nine days!”</p><p>In his mind, the death countdown that appeared after he obtained the Blood Pearl caused him to hesitate.</p><p>In this moment of hesitation, an almost imperceptible red light flashed across the Blood Pearl, and Reverend Huang Yang’s eyes also turned a bit red.</p><p>He paused for a full three breaths.</p><p>Then, he patted his head and his body trembled as if he was completely awake.</p><p>Looking back, he saw a plaque with the words First Hall of Sins hanging on the top of the great hall. He heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>“This is great. We finally arrived at this place after a day’s journey. This time, my death countdown should be able to find an opportunity to reset to zero.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
