He poured his spiritual source into the Blood Pearl and his bloodshot eyes quivered in fear.</p><p>“Retreat! Retreat! Retreat instantly!”</p><p>There was no reaction from the Blood Pearl and the heavy clomping of footsteps in front of him became louder and louder.</p><p>Reverend Huang Yang was on the verge of insanity, because at this time, he could already see the black color reflected on the smooth surface of the Blood Pearl.</p><p>It was totally black!</p><p>He looked up and saw a black giant that was over a thousand feet in height, one that he had never seen before!</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The giant bent its head and roared. The sound surged toward him like a wave and almost made Reverend Huang Yang’s heart collapse.</p><p>“I’ll let you absorb whatever you want!”</p><p>“But please drive it away. If it doesn’t, I’ll have to die here!” He begged.</p><p>The former successor of the Xuanmen United Path sect finally couldn’t suppress the fear in his heart and roared at the Blood Pearl.</p><p>Giant…</p><p>There really was such a tall giant in this Giant Kingdom!</p><p>This black giant could crush any so-called Spiritual Cultivation expert with a single step!</p><p>Be it a higher void level, a Xuanmen inheritance or a Blood Pearl supreme treasure… If he could use one of them, or even all of them in exchange to get this giant to retreat, Reverend Huang Yang would not hesitate to do so.</p><p>However, even after he shouted for so long, the black giant slowly walked over, and the Blood Pearl remained unresponsive.</p><p>“Trash!”</p><p>Reverend Huang Yang really wanted to smash this useless piece of junk into bits, but he was unwilling to do so. He could only put it away, look up with trembling eyes, and he saw the black giant’s…ankles!</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>After he took a deep breath, Reverend Huang Yang said, “Big Brother, please give me a chance. I’m an expert from the Xuanmen United Path sect and a future Demi-Saint. I’m sure you can understand what I mean. If you’re willing to let me go today…”</p><p>“Roar!” The Void Attendant didn’t wait for him to finish and kicked him hard.</p><p>“D*mn thing…Third Upper Lightning Mirror!” Reverend Huang Yang’s body flickered, and with a flip of his hand, he cast a pinching spell. What little spiritual source he had was stretched to the extreme, and a mirror filled with spiritual light that was more than the height of two people was formed.</p><p>The surface of the mirror was uneven and reflected a purple light. In the next second, thunder from the Nine Heavens gathered. With a turbulent momentum, it slithered like a snake and bombarded the black giant’s…toes.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>The spiritual technique that should have severely injured the defenseless higher void level seemed to have only seared a strand of hair on the black giant’s body. After that, there was no movement. It was as if it had been swallowed up and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>At this moment, Reverend Huang Yang’s face turned from green to white. Then, he vomited a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“D*mn!”</p><p>He only had a meagre amount of his Life force left after it had been sucked dry by the Blood Pearl. Who would have thought that he would encounter such a terrifying giant after he followed the inexplicable Guidance to get to this place?</p><p>The fear of the present and the future filled Reverend Huang Yang’s mind almost instantly.</p><p>“No, I can’t fall like this…”</p><p>“My progress has only just begun. This should be my land of opportunity. It’s just a whim, a whim…”</p><p>“Why!!!”</p><p>The black foot blocked out everything else in sight.</p><p>Reverend Huang Yang could no longer resist, his eyes were wide-open and staring and he was unwilling to give up.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>The giant foot stomped downward and the earth trembled. The sound waves that emanated surged forth in air waves that scattered in all directions. The space was distorted, as if the sky and earth would fall apart in the next second.</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>Reverend Huang Yang, who laid limply on the ground, was stunned by the sight of the huge black foot that hovered above his head.</p><p>This foot…did not trample him?</p><p>That’s not right!</p><p>Someone must have helped him resist the attack!</p><p>With a sweep of his spiritual sense, Reverend Huang Yang’s pupils dilated and he turned around in horror.</p><p>Behind him was the wall of a labyrinth, the kind that could not be destroyed no matter how violently one attacked it, even if one used their spiritual source to hammer it a thousand times over.</p><p>At this moment, there was actually a decayed hole that had been dug out, that was about the height of a person!</p><p>Behind the hole, a masked man dressed in an orange robe stood with one hand on the ground.</p><p>He was so relaxed and at ease. In the face of such an attack filled with Absolute Power that could crush the higher void level, he withstood it with one hand. From his eyes, which were devoid of any expression, there were no fluctuations at all. It was as if he did it with such great ease and proficiency.</p><p>“Gulp!”</p><p>Reverend Huang Yang’s Adam’s apple bobbed.</p><p>His intuition told him that this person was even more dangerous than the black giant!</p><p>“May I ask, this fellow Daoist…”</p><p>“Yama, Five Decays of Heaven and Man.”</p><p>With a thump, Reverend Huang Yang felt a little dizzy.</p><p>Yama’s man…Reverend Huang Yang knew about Yama, but he had never thought that any member of Yama could resist the giant’s attack with merely one hand. Was he a physical cultivator?</p><p>At this moment, Reverend Huang Yang suddenly realized that there was something even more terrifying!</p><p>The site where the black giant’s foot came into contact with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man started to change color at an extremely fast speed. It turned gray and started to decay.</p><p>Not long after, the giant’s foot turned into rotten flesh, and fell off in huge chunks to the ground.</p><p>“Roar…”</p><p>The black giant felt the pain and quickly retracted his foot as he retreated quickly.</p><p>As soon as the two sides separated, the gray color that had spread so rapidly stopped and was absorbed by the giant, just like the previous lightning attack.</p><p>“I…Huang Yang…” Reverend Huang Yang stammered out these words. He felt that everything that took place in front of him was simply unbelievable.</p><p>A giant who could crush him with one foot was crippled by this person called ‘Five Decays of Heaven and Man’ with only one hand?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
