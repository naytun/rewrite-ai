(2)</p><p>However, this was a giant palace door. Compared to the rest of the hall, the seal was less broken, but there were still cracks.</p><p>“My Lord, do you think I’m stupid?” Xu Xiaoshou looked at the hole.</p><p>“Call me Elder Han,” The being in the cell didn’t care about the question from the boy outside and corrected him.</p><p>“Alright, Elder Han, what kind of brain fart do you think I have to be like her to help you unseal the seal?” Xu Xiaoshou pointed at Ye Xiao as he spoke.</p><p>“Glared At, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>At the same time, Xu Xiaoshou’s perception had already analyzed the sealing fence.</p><p>It was just an ordinary first-grade ore that contained energy. Logically speaking, it was impossible to seal the monster inside. After all, the frosty white cold air just now was very powerful and of extraordinary quality.</p><p>Therefore, this should be an array!</p><p>Using his ‘Weaving Expertise’ to analyze the sealing barrier, Xu Xiaoshou quickly realized that this was a great array that connected the entire Hall of Unforgivable Crimes.</p><p>The huge instruments of torture in the hall, the ‘God execution token’ on the table, the sealing fence outside the prison cell…They were both essential elements in forming the great array.</p><p>In other words, from the moment the torture device was activated and the “God execution token” was taken away, “Elder Han”, who was inside the cell, had already woken up. He/it might have watched the battle for a while before choosing to speak.</p><p>“Elder Han is a smart fellow. They must have already analyzed Ye Xiao and me, and have made a choice between the both of us. There is a high probability that their decision will be the harmless me…” Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts were extremely clear.</p><p>“What did you say?” In the cell, Elder Han’s voice became impatient. “I’m giving you a chance now. You should seize it. When I come out, you’ll have everything you want.”</p><p>“Oh,” Xu Xiaoshou nodded. He glanced at Ye Xiao and thought, “Since you are the one who called me here, watch carefully now!”</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Ye Xiao stared at Chen Tan in confusion, not knowing what this guy wanted to do.</p><p>Very quickly, she saw Chen Tan’s hands dancing in the air, transforming into afterimages. The spirit threads in his hands were solid and extremely thick, all of them fitting the model of this great hall.</p><p>After a while, this guy randomly shot the threads.</p><p>Some of the spirit threads stuck to the instruments of torture on the outside and hung the broken pieces up, barely restoring them to their original state.</p><p>Some flew to the table and drew a complicated array at the place where the “God-execution token” had been placed as if they were replacing it.</p><p>The rest of the spirit threads hit the hole in the seal of the Sky Three’s cell. Light and shadow flickered, and the spirit threads were woven into a chaotic and incomprehensible spiritual array. However, at the same time, the damages were repaired.</p><p>“Knock knock.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou leaned against the cell door and knocked on the fence. Then, he poked a finger-sized hole in the spiritual array woven from the spirit threads and said,</p><p>“Elder Han, right? Speak. I’ll give you three chances to ask questions.”</p><p>“Are you looking to die, kid?” Elder Han, who was in the cell, was furious. They were obviously angered by Xu Xiaoshou’s attitude and tone. “Just you wait, when I come out…”</p><p>“Try and see if you can come out now.” Xu Xiaoshou was still staring at Ye Xiao, and the corners of his lips curled up.</p><p>The prison cell was silent for a while, and no sound could be heard. Elder Han should be trying to make a breakthrough.</p><p>Ye Xiao fixed her eyes on the hole. However, after a while, the frosty white cold air still did not come out of the finger-sized hole that Chen Tan had made.</p><p>“Suspected, Passive points, +2.”</p><p>Not long after, a terrified voice rang out in the cell.</p><p>“Brat, what have you done? The power of yours truly… Why can’t I get out? How was this possible? The seal has clearly been broken by both of you!”</p><p>Ye Xiao’s eyes, which were hidden in the shadows, were shocked.</p><p>The seal had been repaired?</p><p>She quickly scanned all the places Chen Tan”s threads had touched, including the instruments of torture outside, the simulated “God-execution token” array on the table, and the spiritual array outlined by the complex twisted-like spiritual threads at the hole.</p><p>He was a spiritual array master?</p><p>No! It was very likely that this fellow had not only found the core of the seal of the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes in such a short period of time, but he had also repaired the ancient seal that had been destroyed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Even in the Path Division, his attainments in spiritual arrays were among the best!</p><p>“Chen Tan…”</p><p>Ye Xiao softly muttered the name.</p><p>She really did not remember such an outstanding talent in the Southern Region. Not only did he grasp the aura of the power of the evil energy, but he also knew the Phantom Swords Technique.</p><p>Now, with the ease of a finger, this fellow had instantly restored an ancient array that only existed in ancient times and was probably impossible to find in the present day without any reference.</p><p>Who was he?</p><p>Who was Chen Tan?</p><p>Ye Xiao’s brain was spinning rapidly. She felt that the two terms “Qingjing sect” and “Chen Tan” had suddenly become extremely important in her heart.</p><p>It was a pity…</p><p>If Yi was still here, if Yi was still her partner, he would be able to find this place quickly no matter what the situation was.</p><p>With Yi’s vast knowledge, he could probably explain to her the story of the eighteen generations of Qingjing sect and Chen Tan in one go.</p><p>Ye Xiao’s eyes suddenly dimmed.</p><p>However, these thoughts were just a fantasy…Yi was already dead!</p><p>Now, her partner was Yu Lingdi, and Yu Lingdi had also been teleported away by the spatial chaos of the maze.</p><p>Instead of waiting for him to find her or take the initiative to find her, she might as well think about how to take Chen Tan down and kill that “Elder Han” at the same time.</p><p>“You seem to have understood something?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
