The next second, he was inside the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, everything was simple and old-fashioned.</p><p>The noble dark gold color was completely different from the appearance of the First Hall of Sins. It exuded a simple yet not too simple aura, low-key but hidden with a noble and restrained luxury.</p><p>The interior style and decorations of the First Hall of Sins were different from what he had expected.</p><p>This place could not be said to be big…No, it was actually very small!</p><p>Apart from a table on the left of the entrance, on which were some messy and dusty wooden figurines, there was only a tea table in the middle.</p><p>The tea table was also very small, about the height of one’s legs. There were small wooden chairs on all four sides. It looked like it had been placed there for children or friends of the owner of this place who did not need to sit down and play or chat.</p><p>Lastly, there was a wooden staircase that went up to the wall on the right and was hidden on the second floor of the attic.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment.</p><p>The internal structure of the First Hall of Sins was so small that it was beyond his expectations.</p><p>He still remembered what Xiao Kongtong had told him along the way. The First Hall of Sins that Master Dean had gone through was a dark, sealed, vast and enormous maze filled with a strange mist.</p><p>However, compared to the current situation…</p><p>“Hello?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou called out subconsciously. He didn’t expect the wooden pavilion inside the First Hall of Sins to have such good sound absorption. There was only a faint echo.</p><p>Impossible!</p><p>How could this be the First Hall of Sins?</p><p>It was so small that even a light whisper produced an echo. This place was clearly not the First Hall of Sins, but another place!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly became nervous. However, through his ‘Perception’, he could see that Master Siren, Xiao Kongtong and his little Junior Sister who had stepped into the First Hall of Sins before him had all disappeared.</p><p>“Random teleportation?”</p><p>“This is too absurd. Another one?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suspected that he had been randomly teleported to a small room in the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>His heartbeat started to accelerate and his palms began to sweat. Xu Xiaoshou subconsciously rubbed the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale, only to find that there was only a faint heartbeat.</p><p>“It’s not too dangerous…”</p><p>He put away the scale and turned to leave.</p><p>If he could enter through the door, he could leave through the door, right?</p><p>It was natural that he had this thought and he pressed his hand on the ancient wooden door that didn’t look like the inside of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>“Hum…”</p><p>An intangible fluctuation flowed out from the place where his palm had touched and spread to all the space in the area.</p><p>After that…</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>His heartbeat that had accelerated so rapidly suddenly slowed down after a heavy thud.</p><p>At the same time, everything in the attic seemed to have slowed down countless times and seemed to come to a standstill.</p><p>“C..c…c…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s movements slowed down after he turned his head. The horror in his pupils was magnified in an instant, but it could not be delayed any longer.</p><p>At this moment, the Transformation brought about by the Dragon Apricot displayed its function.</p><p>With his excellent eyesight, Xu Xiaoshou could still clearly see with the help of his Perception, the details of the messy wooden sculptures on the table to the left, with its back that faced the wooden door, even though his thoughts had been stopped.</p><p>He had been so nervous that he hadn’t noticed at first glance, but there was something familiar about these wooden figurines.</p><p>Even though the exterior craftsmanship was crude, Xu Xiaoshou could still recognize a few familiar faces when he saw the faces of the wooden figurines.</p><p>It wasn’t that these wooden figurines looked similar, but the aura that surrounded their faces was very similar to some people he had seen before. It was almost 99% similar!</p><p>“Oh…”</p><p>His thoughts about that were delayed and Xu Xiaoshou subconsciously turned his gaze to the tea table.</p><p>Among the dusty tea table and four small wooden chairs, the main seat that faced the door was clean and dust-free!</p><p>At the same time, there was water in the teapot, and a faint trace of steam came out of the spout. One of the teacups had been washed; it was obvious that it had been used.</p><p>All of this pointed to one fact…</p><p>“Bazhun’an! Dao Qiongcang! Gou Wuyue! Ai Cangsheng!”</p><p>“These nine little wooden figures. I recognize four of the faces that were carved… There’s no aura. What is the connection between them?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t have time to think anymore. He was terrified, and the noise in his ears became louder and louder.</p><p>He finally couldn’t help but look around again to search for the source of the noise.</p><p>His eyes then fell onto the wooden wall opposite the wooden door.</p><p>There were some strange and old wooden sculptures that hung from the wall. They were all very ancient and simple, but they all had extraordinary auras.</p><p>Apart from some background decorations, the most eye-catching ones were a strange-looking gear that hung on the left side and rotated slowly. In the middle was a wooden clock with a pendulum that swung from the left to the right at the same frequency, and on the far right side, there seemed to be an illusion of a transparent handmade scepter.</p><p>What was that sound?</p><p>What was that sound?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried hard to identify what the noise was, but his mind was filled with an even more horrifying thought.</p><p>“There’s someone!”</p><p>“This tea table is a clear indication that someone was here before!”</p><p>“That person must have left not too long ago, because the water in the teapot is still hot… Could it be the owner of this place?”</p><p>As his eyes moved with difficulty, Xu Xiaoshou had already darted to the wooden staircase that led upwards on the far right.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
