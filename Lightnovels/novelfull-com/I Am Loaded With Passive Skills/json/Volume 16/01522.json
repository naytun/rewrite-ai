He extended two fingers, imbued them with Sword Cognition and before anyone could react, he pointed them at Mu Zixi’s glabella.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>The sound of the sword rang out and shook the surroundings.</p><p>The little girl was shocked and quickly retreated behind Xu Xiaoshou. She touched the area between her eyebrows in a panic, but there was no blood.</p><p>W-what was that about?</p><p>Was he out to kill me just now?</p><p>I merely asked a few questions…</p><p>“I do know ‘Sword Cognition’. That was my ‘Sword Cognition’.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong smiled gently and as he lowered his finger, he explained, “Now, this ‘Sword Cognition’ is in your body. If something should happen, you can activate it and use it. As long as I sense it and am nearby, I will come over to help you take care of the problem.”</p><p>Was this a meeting gift?</p><p>Mu Zixi held her forehead and blinked. The fear in her eyes disappeared and was replaced with a sweet smile. “Thanks…Thank you, Senior Brother.”</p><p>“It’s nothing.” Xiao Kongtong laughed and waved his hand. It was only right that he took care of Elder Sleeveless’s disciple.</p><p>“Your ‘Sword Cognition’ can be used to summon yourself?” Xu Xiaoshou was confused. “Can I use that to contact you?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s brows twitched, and he said with slight disdain, “Don’t you have a way to contact Teacher? If something happened to you, don’t look for me, just look for my Teacher! After all, I might not even be able to settle your problem.”</p><p>“+(Disliked, Passive Points+) +1”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>Don’t belittle yourself, Eldest Senior Brother! You’re the owner of the Fringe Moon Immortal City and the Boss who ruled over an entire realm!</p><p>Xiao Kongtong didn’t see it in that way at all.</p><p>When he brought this up, the image of the Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi being provoked by Xu Xiaoshou flashed through his mind.</p><p>If it had not been for Master Siren who had appeared and killed the Demi-Saint’s incarnation, it was hard to imagine how things would have ended. At the very least, Xiao Kongtong didn’t think that he could kill a Demi-Saint.</p><p>He could only hold on for Ten Auras under the Demi-Saint’s attack…What a joke, Ten Auras only!</p><p>“Has everything been settled?” At this time, Mei Siren saw that the few of them were done and asked Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Yes.” After he killed Elder Xie and Ghost Granny, Xu Xiaoshou had already informed Master Siren about his plan to return to the Yuan Mansion and consume the Dragon Apricot.</p><p>Now that he was being questioned, he replied, “There were no big problems. My cultivation level has also been consolidated. I will be able to break through to the Sovereign Dao Realm in a few days’ time.”</p><p>With a swish, Mu Zixi turned her head when she heard this. So fast?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s cultivation level fluctuations had become so obscure that no one could see them clearly, so she had not known about it.</p><p>But she also remembered that before she fell into a deep sleep, Xu Xiaoshou had just broken through to the Master Stage not too long ago, right?</p><p>After she slept for a night, it became the Sovereign Dao Realm. Now Xu Xiaoshou was also about to step into this realm?</p><p>“How did you cultivate?” Mu Zixi’s eyes were filled with curiosity, and she felt a sense of danger. How could Xu Xiaoshou’s cultivation level advance so quickly? He would soon catch up with her again!</p><p>“It was tougher than yours.” Xu Xiaoshou glanced at his Junior Sister unhappily and didn’t want to answer. Was this girl doing this on purpose? You must be doing this on purpose! You want to rile me up…</p><p>“The Sovereign Dao Realm was a threshold. The Ancient Swordsman didn’t have this threshold, or rather, they did, but it wasn’t as obvious as the Spiritual Cultivators. To step into the Sovereign Dao Realm through this Spiritual Cultivation, you have to think about which path you want to cultivate in advance. You can’t bite off more than you can chew.” Mei Siren pointed out.</p><p>He knew that Xu Xiaoshou possessed many abilities.</p><p>Before one reached the Sovereign Stage, the combination of the various abilities might set off a strange and unpredictable fighting style, and the result might be more than what one bargained for.</p><p>However, after one achieved the Sovereign Stage and stepped into the Great Path, this method was no longer desirable.</p><p>Throughout the five regions, how many geniuses were there?</p><p>However, the number of Spiritual Cultivators who cultivated the Upanishad could be counted on one’s fingers. If he cultivated more than one path, his energy would be scattered.</p><p>Under such circumstances, if he still set the Upanishad as his goal, the time and cost he would have to spend to cultivate it would be too high.</p><p>Therefore, he had to choose one as the main and the rest as the supplementary. Only with a clear distinction of the primary and secondary would he be able to advance continuously. Otherwise, even a genius like Xu Xiaoshou, in the eyes of Mei Siren, would be trapped in the Sovereign Dao Realm for a few decades.</p><p>A few decades…</p><p>This was perhaps still a short-term calculation.</p><p>Once Xu Xiaoshou reached a dead end and split up his experience between Spirit Cultivation, the Way of the Sword and Physique Cultivator, he might not be able to reach the same level for hundreds of years.</p><p>“That’s what I wanted to ask.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded in agreement. He didn’t think that he was such a monster who could break all the established rules of the world.</p><p>He was already at the Sovereign Stage in the Way of the Sword, and his study of swordsmanship from Master Siren was one way.</p><p>However, he had to master the Sovereign Dao Realm This was related to another wave of upgrades for the Passive System, so he could continue to add points to strengthen it.</p><p>However, the problem lay in which to choose as the primary path in the Spiritual Cultivation.</p><p>“I’ve seen some Spiritual Cultivators before,” he said. “The bounded domain they mastered after they reach the Sovereign Dao Realm are very special?” Xu Xiaoshou was confused and posed this question.</p><p>Even though Mei Siren and Xiao Kongtong were both Ancient Swordsmen, they were born in the era of Spiritual Cultivation and had grown to such a level. How could they know so little about this Spiritual Cultivation?</p><p>Before Mei Siren could answer, Xiao Kongtong, who had killed countless Spiritual Cultivators during the battle in the Eastern Moon Realm spoke up.</p><p>“The Sovereign Domain is a domain with special rules. Usually, whoever opened the bounded domain will be the dominant one. Whoever’s bounded domain is stronger will be able to shatter the other party’s bounded domain. It’s simple and brutal.”</p><p>“The deeper one’s comprehension of the Force of Rules and the Great Path, the geographical advantage of the expansion of one’s domain would become increasingly evident.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
