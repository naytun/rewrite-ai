(2)</p><p>Suddenly, there was a loud crack. Under the force of the aura of decay, the Cursed Yin Eye dimmed, then shattered and turned into spiritual energy before it dissipated totally.</p><p>In the distance, Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils trembled, and he finally realized what ‘danger’ meant.</p><p>This Power of the Evil God was something that even Elder Han couldn’t handle for a short duration of time. He managed to force it out of his body only when he transformed into his true Ghost Beast form.</p><p>What’s with this Five Decays of Heaven and Man?</p><p>He had the ability to make the Cursed Yin Eye shatter in an instant?</p><p>Silence fell.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts surged.</p><p>He didn’t want to fight anymore. He wanted to run for his life.</p><p>The idea to turn the Five Decays of Heaven and Man into Xu Xiaoshou and let Ye Xiao deal with it, along with Gu Qinger’s rescue, disappeared at this moment.</p><p>This was a monster that could fight a Demi-Saint!</p><p>He was at the top level among the higher void level. He might not be as good as Master Siren, but in terms of weird methods, he was definitely better!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately determined the orange-masked man’s combat power.</p><p>“+(Suspected, Passive Points+)+1.”</p><p>“+(Affected, Passive Points)+1.”</p><p>“+(Conjecture, Passive Points,+)+1.” This suspicious soul’s thoughts never stopped.</p><p>Even if the Five Decays of Heaven and Man appeared calm on the surface, Xu Xiaoshou could see the waves of never ending thoughts hidden under his mask.</p><p>After a long while, he swallowed a few Elixirs to cover up his injury. When the injury on his arm was almost completely healed, Xu Xiaoshou looked up…</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was still in a dazed state!</p><p>He stared at his severed palm and did not display any emotion. Only the Information Bar showed that his thoughts had not stopped.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly smelled the stench that drifted from his body.</p><p>After his ‘Strengthen’ skill reached the Sovereign Stage, his treasured body was ethereal, no longer covered in impurities, and even emitted a dark fragrance, so how could there be a foul smell?</p><p>“There’s something wrong with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man!”</p><p>“This guy could be even more terrifying than Ye Xiao. I can’t mess around with him!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately ran away.</p><p>He took off at full speed and didn’t care about Gu Qinger’s fate. He almost turned into a bolt of lightning, as if he fled from the God of Death, and plunged into the darkness of the labyrinth.</p><p>“Chen. It was like that…also…”</p><p>It was not until the figure in the distance had almost disappeared from his spiritual senses that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man finally raised his head that was filled with intermittent thoughts.</p><p>He had been injured three times by the attack just now.</p><p>One was the damage caused by Chen Ruye’s physical attack. This physical body was at least at the Sovereign Physique level!</p><p>The second was the damage caused by the Sword Will. Chen Ruye was also an Ancient Swordsman. When he attacked, he used the Sword Will to cut his own body and almost severed his arm.</p><p>The third was the damage from the Cursed Yin Eye. Compared to the first two, the third damage was insignificant. Perhaps it was because this energy attack was just child’s play under the influence of the Body of Decay.</p><p>‘Physical body, Sword Will… Evil Technique?”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man first swung his hand, and after a few cracking sounds, the flesh and blood were regenerated, and the severed palm healed in an instant.</p><p>Then, suddenly a ray of bright light ignited in the pair of dull eyes hidden under the orange mask!</p><p>“Where are you running to?”</p><p>The hoarse voice of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had a faint tinge of perverted excitement as his body blended into the darkness.</p><p>He didn’t even care about Gu Qinger. He set his eyes on this new prey and took off in the direction where Chen Ruye had fled to.</p><p>“Old man, do you really think that I, Chen Ruye, am afraid of you?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou roared crazily from the front. His voice was calm, but he was still in a state of panic.</p><p>It was not because of the person who chased after him, but because he found that as time went by, not only did his body start to smell, but his armpits also began to sweat…</p><p>How was that possible?</p><p>I’m f*cking Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>I’m the Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou who committed all kinds of evil and killed people like flies. Even Rao Yaoyao feared me!</p><p>I even dared to play with the Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi, so how could I sweat due to fear and nervousness?</p><p>Not only did his armpits sweat, but all the luxurious stuff on his body started to corrode.</p><p>Jade hairpins, accessories, necklaces, rings… All the items that had spiritual quality started to lose their spiritual quality, just like the body that constantly lost its Life force.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt irritated.</p><p>The word ‘Affected’ appeared repeatedly in the Information Bar, and this word was magnified infinitely in his eyes.</p><p>“Ah!” Xu Xiaoshou suddenly let out a loud roar, as if he wanted to vent his anger.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Spirit Awakening.</p><p>“F*ck!” Xu Xiaoshou cursed and nearly went crazy.</p><p>He could have sworn that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man definitely did not use an illusion to control him.</p><p>However, he was affected by the Spirit Awakening, which meant that this strange weakening ability had affected his spirit and even his soul.</p><p>“Five Decays of Heaven and Man, Five Decays of Heaven and Man…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou mumbled as if he had understood something.</p><p>He was no longer a noob when it came to Spiritual Cultivation. He knew that this ability was called the Five Decays of Heaven and Man!</p><p>Not long ago, he had laughed at Yama’s nickname and how funny it was to be called the ‘Five Decays of Heaven and Man’.</p><p>Now, he realized that he was the clown.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man had really mastered the ‘Five Decays of Heaven and Man’ and had mastered the power of misfortune and curses.</p><p>He, the Xu Yue Grey Palace’s Chen Ruye, squeezed with all his might and strength, but he couldn’t even squeeze out the power of a Ghost Beast.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>From what he could see with his ‘Perception’, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s speed was extremely fast, the speed of a higher void level.</p><p>When he was about to catch up with him, he stopped and calmly took out a golden talisman and injected his spiritual source into it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
