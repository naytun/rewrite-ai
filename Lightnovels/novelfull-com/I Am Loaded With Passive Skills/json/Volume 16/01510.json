(2)", "volume": 16, "volume_title": "Volume 16", "body": "<h1>Chapter 1510 - 1510 Awakener! (2)</h1><p>1510 Awakener! (2)</p><p>First of all, the Holy Medicine was incomprehensible. Second, the Dragon Apricot’s target was the Dragon Clan in the Dragon Cave. The powerful physical enhancement for humans appeared only superficial to the Dragon race.</p><p>Therefore, he couldn’t compare his combat strength to humans after he ate 99 Dragon Apricot and obtained the ‘power of the Dragon ancestor’. He should really compare it to the Dragon Clan!</p><p>“A human-shaped Dragon?”</p><p>“The direction of physical growth?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were filled with fervor and he had the urge to finish 99 Dragon Apricots.</p><p>However, when he saw another dust-coated Dragon Apricot on the ground, he decisively put an end to this thought.</p><p>“Break through to the Sovereign Stage!”</p><p>“After I reach the Sovereign Dao Realm, my body’s endurance should be even stronger. At that time, I won’t activate the Breathing Technique first. I’ll use some time to enhance the ‘power of the Dragon ancestor’.”</p><p>“It’s impossible to continue to eat the Dragon Apricot now. Even if I want to, I would waste more than half a day after I eat one. The ‘death countdown’ of the Abyss Island would not wait till I get stronger!”</p><p>“Yeah, I need to calm down.”</p><p>As he suppressed his impulse, Xu Xiaoshou observed his energy reserve.</p><p>As a Holy Medicine, even if most of the Dragon Apricot’s power was used to strengthen the body, the excess medicinal power seeped into his energy reserve and was absorbed. At this time, Xu Xiaoshou could hardly suppress the breakthrough of his realm.</p><p>Above his energy reserve, all the forces competed with each other, such as the Infernal Original Seed, the Three Days Frozen Calamity, the Sword Cognition and the Holy Power. All these were very unstable.</p><p>This situation had already occurred after he had swallowed the Holy Miracle Fruit. With the intervention of the Holy Power, his energy reserve had become extremely turbulent, and small conflicts would occasionally occur.</p><p>The only change it brought was that Xu Xiaoshou’s Transformation was about to break through.</p><p>He could still suppress it before, but now that he had swallowed the Dragon Apricot, the excess medicinal power gathered in his energy reserve and formed an illusory ‘Dragon Pearl’ that was powerful enough to compete with the various Saint-Stage powers.</p><p>Even though this Dragon Pearl was very weak now and had been formed from the power of a Dragon Apricot, its level was extremely high.</p><p>The intervention in his energy reserve caused the already unbalanced energy reserve situation to become turbulent again.</p><p>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”</p><p>With his inner vision activated, Xu Xiaoshou could feel that his energy reserve surged continuously, each wave higher than the last. They constantly broke through the shackles of the Star Worship State as they tried to break through to the outside world.</p><p>“Within the next few days.”</p><p>This was the first time he could clearly sense the day he was so close to the Sovereign Dao Realm. Xu Xiaoshou knew that his energy reserve could no longer contain the various powers that almost overflowed from his body.</p><p>He needed a bigger vessel to store the various Saint-Stage powers in his body.</p><p>The only way was to break through.</p><p>“But not now!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought about it seriously. He still had one more thing to do. As long as he completed this task, he would be able to break through to the Sovereign Dao realm.</p><p>Looking at the Red Interface that belonged to the system in his mind, Xu Xiaoshou saw the Extended Passive Skill column at a glance.</p><p>He didn’t want to suppress his realm anymore. The enemy was getting increasingly stronger, so it would be good to break through as soon as possible.</p><p>However, the breakthrough of a major realm, according to his past experience, would inevitably be accompanied by an upgrade of the system.</p><p>Once the system was upgraded, the prices of the items in the store would increase, such as the Passive Key and the Awakening Stone.</p><p>The price of the former had been 1000 passive points at the start. As the system upgraded, the price had increased to 5000 passive points, and now it was 10000.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not expect the latter price to increase. He was scammed and his Passive Points rose from 10000 to the current 30000.</p><p>The Passive Key was used to draw passive skills. Xu Xiaoshou didn’t want to waste his Passive Points now. He felt that his various passive skills were adequate for now. He would save them for when the Sovereign Dao Realm leveled up.</p><p>However, there were still two skills in the Extended Passive Skill column that had not been awakened – Transformation and Toughness.</p><p>“Even if I am not awakened now, I’ll be awakened later.”</p><p>“However, if I were to awaken after my breakthrough, I would definitely be ripped off again. I should be the only one who can take advantage of others. How could I allow the system to take advantage of me time and again?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sneered as he looked at the Passive Points under the Information Bar.</p><p>“Passive Points: 2530206.”</p><p>“It had not increased by a lot.” He sighed slightly.</p><p>The enemies he had encountered recently were very strong. They were either the higher void level or Demi-Saints, but there were very few of them. There were only one or two, which were not conducive for the growth of his Passive Points.</p><p>This was because the Passive System’s awards occurred once every second, and depended on the number of people and not the level of cultivation.</p><p>“Forget it, it’s enough.”</p><p>Without any hesitation, Xu Xiaoshou decisively bought an Awakening Stone.</p><p>It costs 30000 for one Awakening Stone. Based on the frequency of the seven or eight Awakening Stones in the past, he felt that no matter how unlucky he was, he could at least awaken the two remaining Extended Passive Skills by throwing in 50000 Passive Points.</p><p>“Uh, the flag can’t be raised, take no offence of this childish babble, take no offence of this childish babble.”</p><p>“I didn’t say anything just now!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly exclaimed and abandoned all other thoughts. He began to bind skills to the Awakening Stone and sent it skimming across the water.</p><p>“Heavenly Spirit, Earth Spirit, Grand Supreme Elderly Lord, quickly show your Spirit!”</p><p>The Awakening Stone drew an elegant arc on the Awakening Pool and sank to the bottom.</p><p>“Awakening failed!”</p><p>“Awakening failed!”</p><p>“Awakening successful!”</p><p>“Toughness awakened: Freeze!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The Awakening was a success after three tries?</p><p>“Luck is finally on my side?”</p><p>“Freeze.”</p><p>“A defensive-type of Awakening Ability? Just from the name, it sounds intimidating”</p><p>After some thought, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t make a decision immediately. Instead, he tried his Awakening Skill without even thinking.</p><p>“Ha!”</p><p>“Freeze… activate!”</p><p>His first strike had no effect, but this action made Xu Xiaoshou feel as if his body had been petrified, and a faint golden light emanated from his body.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
