From their appearance, I guess they were comrades during the war. They were just acquaintances who had nothing in common.”</p><p>“But she couldn’t even take one move from Demi-Saint Jiang…She even had the Cang Godhood Sword, and her surname was Rao. If she wanted to save people, she should have a way to solve any subsequent problems…You said that the Seven Sword Deity are all very strong, so it’s impossible she hid her skills?”</p><p>“What if she really can’t win?”</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>“Is the relationship between Demi-Saint Jiang and Rao Yaoyao very good? If it were you, if someone asked you to cut the grass and leave its roots behind, and asked you to offer your head to this root in the future, what would you choose?”</p><p>“I’ll kill them all, but if I can’t beat them…I’ll kill him with a plan!”</p><p>“That’s why Rao Yaoyao had no choice but to leave. At the moment, she really can’t beat a Demi-Saint. Resistance would only lead to death for Demi-Saint Jiang, who had no other way out.”</p><p>“Then I finally understand. There are indeed weaklings among the Seven Sword Deity. Rao Yaoyao is the one. She’s really a noob!”</p><p>“Silly disciple, you’re wrong again.”</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao will be conferred the title of Saint!”</p><p>“???”</p><p>At that moment, Xu Xiaoshou once again felt that his train of thought could not keep up with Master Siren’s. He could not recall the shock he felt when he heard this statement.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“I met Rao Yaoyao in the First Pavilion in the Sky before and had a conversation with her.”</p><p>“I know that.” Xu Xiaoshou had eavesdropped before.</p><p>“At that time, I didn’t know why this little girl was in charge of the Dongtianwang City. I watched her grow up, so I knew her personality very well.”</p><p>“So, why…”</p><p>“When the night battle in the Imperial City started, many incidents occurred in the Yunlun Mountain Range and the Abyss Island fell and all of you came here. Then I understood that this was all a scheme, someone’s scheme!”</p><p>“Who was it?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, do you know which of the Nine Major Sword Techniques is stronger?” Master Siren did not answer directly, but changed the topic.</p><p>“There’s still a competition between the Nine Major Sword Techniques? This is the first time I’ve heard of it. Please tell me, Teacher.”</p><p>‘Nine Swords Techniques, Mo Sword Technique, Phantom Sword Technique…It’s said that the Sword God created the Nine Major Sword Techniques in this order. I don’t know the details, but I’m sure that the Emotion Sword Technique was created last.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“After he created the eight major sword principles, the Sword God traveled the world and hid his sword. Finally, he broke through the investiture of the gods, which prompted him to come out with this step that was the Emotion Sword Technique.”</p><p>“Love…”</p><p>“Well, you should have realized that the Nine Major Sword Techniques only has two realms. The last two Sword Techniques are exceptions. The Hidden Sword Technique had only one realm, while the Emotion Sword Technique had three realms.”</p><p>“The Secular Sword, the Emotionless Sword Technique, and the Immortal Sword?”</p><p>“That’s right. When other sword techniques were cultivated to the extreme, the two realms will only display one ‘move’ that is similar to a Spiritual Technique. However, the Emotion Sword Technique is different. Its three realms are all comprehension of Dao and corresponds to ‘man’, ‘earth’, and ‘heaven’, respectively.”</p><p>“So, the Emotion Sword Technique is the strongest? ‘This…Uh, it’s a little beyond my imagination!”</p><p>“You can understand it this way…The Secular Sword cultivation phase began to step into the mortal world. The most extreme of the ‘phase’ should be the ‘Manifestation of all living things. The Emotionless Sword Technique reliance phase, when one’s body entered the mortal world, they would not be stained by the mortal world. They would be as calm and unmoving as the mountains, rivers, and seas for eternity. This was the ultimate ‘rely’, called ‘reliance on the mountains and seas’. The otherworldly Swordsman, if he leapt into the world and did not enter the Path Principles, could knock open the gate of Outer Heaven, called the ‘mysterious gate’… If you can master these three, you don’t need any other sword techniques to rise above the Holy Emperor Realm and enter the God State.”</p><p>“What…Teacher, if that’s the case, why have I only seen one person cultivate the Emotion Sword Technique? Why did you not cultivate it?”</p><p>“I can’t cultivate it. The Emotion Sword Technique is too difficult. Even a poor man can’t reach the first realm in his life. Just to cultivate this small phase can take a lifetime to fulfill.”</p><p>“Small phase? There were other phases? What did Teacher cultivate, was it the Manifestation of all living things?”</p><p>“No, I only cultivated the ‘master-student phase, which is one of the’ all-life phases’. It’s very difficult to achieve just this.”</p><p>“Then, Rao Yaoyao…”</p><p>“What she cultivated was the most orthodox Emotion Sword Technique that the Sword God had ever used. It’s called the ‘Manifestation of all living things’. Once this technique was cultivated, she could be a Saint in no time.”</p><p>“You don’t even dare to cultivate this ‘Manifestation of all living things’, how would she dare…”</p><p>“Forgiveness.”</p><p>“Oh, I understand. What about her ‘Manifestation of all living things’?”</p><p>“It’s not complete yet, but soon. It’s just one step away.”</p><p>At that time, Master Siren sighed with emotion and said.</p><p>“This talented daughter of the Rao family has had a smooth journey and has never encountered any obstacles. However, she encountered such a setback in the Dongtianwang City, the Yunlun Mountain Range and even the Abyss Island.</p><p>“Either sink into ruin, or rise in destruction…I think that the next time Rao Yaoyao is defeated, it will be when she has cultivated the Manifestation of all living things and it will also bethe time for her to be conferred the title of Saint!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
