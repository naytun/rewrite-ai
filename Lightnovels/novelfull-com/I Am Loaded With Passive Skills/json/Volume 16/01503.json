This is the most precious supreme treasure among all supreme treasures!</p><p>The loss of life force was not scary. Reverend Huang Yang could already feel that he was about to become one with this supreme treasure. The connection between the two became deeper after this absorption.</p><p>Perhaps, after the complete fusion, he would be able to control the Blood Pearl without any side effects!</p><p>As he fantasized about the future, his blurry voice became clear in the hazy world illuminated by the Blood Pearl.</p><p>“I’ve almost attracted three saint calamities along the way with you. If it weren’t for the countdown to exile, I would have turned around and left.”</p><p>At first, he couldn’t hear what the demi-saint said and his face couldn’t be seen. But now, Reverend Huang Yang could see some bitterness and discomfort on the demi-saint’s face.</p><p>Did… Did he really get a hold of something?</p><p>The saint calamity… Reverend Huang Yang stared at the man in the orange mask. He felt that this man was not a demi-saint yet, but he could control a demi-saint, which meant that he was more terrifying than ordinary demi-saints!</p><p>“I’ve said it. This is a fair trade. I want Xu Xiaoshou’s head, and you need a helper below the demi-saint level to help you fight for the exemption order. We both get what we need.”</p><p>“Don’t forget what I told you before. Even if you’re in your best condition, you can’t attack as you please in the First Hall of Sins. Not to mention, your strength is greatly reduced and your attacks are restricted.”</p><p>The orange-masked man pushed open the door of the First Hall of Sins as he spoke. He stepped in without hesitation. He didn’t even care if the demi-saint would follow him. He disappeared into the darkness of the hall.</p><p>“Five Decays of Heaven and Man…”</p><p>The demi-saint behind him teleported to the entrance of the hall in an instant. After gritting his teeth and muttering, he followed him in.</p><p>…</p><p>“Goodness!”</p><p>Reverend Huang Yang’s heart was beating wildly, feeling as if he had touched upon a high-level secret.</p><p>Before he had obtained the Blood Pearl, he had been like a headless fly. He could only fly around Sky City, and he did not know when he would be in danger or in a dead end.</p><p>Now, he could actually come into contact with the secrets of the upper echelons. He could predict the future, or in another way, spy on the risks of the existence of a certain place that he could not have previously.</p><p>This gave Reverend Huang Yang a sense of superiority.</p><p>“The Blood Pearl is a true treasure! I’m afraid that the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch that Elder Xie and Ghost Granny have can only help them last one more breath against the demi-saint.</p><p>“But I’m different. After knowing the risk of the First Hall of Sins, I can choose to turn around and leave right now.”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A red light flashed from his eyes and Reverend Huang Yang suddenly shook his head with an excited look on his face.</p><p>“Interesting!”</p><p>“This is the battlefield that I, Reverend Huang Yang, should join!”</p><p>“Fighting with the higher void level, playing games with the demi-saint… Nothing more than this can make a man happy in the world!”</p><p>With that, he pushed open the door of the First Hall of Sins and strode in with the Blood Pearl in his hand, not caring about the outside world at all.</p><p>…</p><p>Thud.</p><p>At some point, footsteps were heard at the entrance of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>“This place seems a little familiar…”</p><p>A soft voice sounded, and a figure in brocade clothes landed in front of the palace door.</p><p>His forehead was full, his eyes were bright, and his black hair was tied into a bun without any messy strands. He should be a person who had read a lot of poetry and books. He was full of spirit and handsome, and his temperament was refined.</p><p>What was eye-catching was that there was a black rope around his neck, which was connected to a rough door-shaped wood carving. It looked like an amulet, but the cheap wooden ornament did not match his luxurious appearance.</p><p>“The First Hall of Sins…”</p><p>This handsome scholar who had just arrived softly read the words on the plaque at the entrance of the great hall. After muttering for a moment, he frowned and muttered to himself,</p><p>“This place shouldn’t be the First Hall of Sins, or did I remember it wrong again?”</p><p>After saying this much, the scholar stretched out his hand and swiped in the air.</p><p>There were no fluctuations of spiritual source, but an ancient, dark golden, three-story building appeared out of thin air where the First Hall of Sins was located.</p><p>It replaced the original majestic great hall, but it was vague, as if no one could see it.</p><p>“That’s more like it!</p><p>“Hmm, what am I here for?”</p><p>The scholar chuckled at first, and then his eyes were filled with doubt. However, he did not stop and walked into the pavilion while thinking.</p><p>As his back slowly disappeared into the dark golden three-story pavilion, the words engraved on the plaque that overlapped with the three-story pavilion in the First Hall of Sins began to become slightly jumbled.</p><p>A moment later, it was the “First Hall of Sins”.</p><p>After a while, it turned into “All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion”.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
