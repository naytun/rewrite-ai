(1)</h1><p>1570 Frozen Ghost of the Ganges River, shocking the Saint Without Word! (1)</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>The cat-like Frost Ferret suddenly retracted the black ghostly energy around its body, and a pair of black wings that spanned more than a hundred feet in size spread out on its back.</p><p>The wings were shaped like a bat’s wings and were pure black in color. They formed a sharp contrast to the white and flawless Frost Ferret.</p><p>When Elder Han released his Ghost Beast form, he felt the surging power in his body that was no longer being controlled. He couldn’t suppress the smile on his face, and shrieked in joy.</p><p>He could not remember how long it had been since he had been able to control all his strength…</p><p>Although it seemed that it could only possess this power for a short period of time, and he had to find a host body as soon as possible.</p><p>However, he was invincible during this period of time!</p><p>“Since you know my past, you should also know my true strength. How can you not be convinced and submit to me?” Elder Han’s black eyes stared at Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>As he spoke, the wings on his back flapped gently, and the mighty power of a Demi-Saint descended.</p><p>With a loud rumble, the huge instruments of torture in the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes dropped from the sky.</p><p>The nodes that maintained the seal were all frozen and shattered by the terrifying pressure; this did not allow the heretic cultivator from the Southern Region any chance to form a great array of seals.</p><p>At the same time, almost 99% of the pressure from a peak Demi-Saint was directed at Rao Yaoyao alone.</p><p>Elder Han was aware that if the covert attack failed, everyone would be on their guard.</p><p>At this moment, this Sword Deity was his most important opponent. Ye Xiao and Chen Tan were relegated to the back for the moment.</p><p>If this woman didn’t die, he wouldn’t be able to launch sneak attacks on Ye Xiao and Chen Tan.</p><p>“Ka ka!”</p><p>Ice crystals formed on Rao Yaoyao’s body, and her exposed skin turned deathly pale due to the extreme cold. It didn’t take long for her skin to crack and bleed.</p><p>But she remained motionless.</p><p>Just like that, she gently held the sword that was slanted at an angle to her chest, and the two fingers of her left hand slowly moved along the sword, inch by inch, without the slightest bit of panic. No one knew what was on her mind.</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>Elder Han was obviously angered by the blatant way she ignored him.</p><p>The giant beast roared in the air, and with a flap of its black wings, a frost storm began to form in the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes.</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>The tables fell and the pillars cracked.</p><p>Even the instruments of torture that could be used to execute Demi-Saints were attacked by the frost storm and shattered into pieces.</p><p>“Isn’t he too strong?”</p><p>Faced with such a destructive force, Xu Xiaoshou had no choice but to stand up and protect himself with his Spiritual Source. He had to move about.</p><p>If he continued to sit still, he would turn into an ice sculpture.</p><p>After Elder Han released his Ghost Beast Form, he didn’t even need to use his full strength. The impact of the Demi-Saint’s pressure on the surrounding environment was enough to affect everyone present.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao remained unmoved.</p><p>When her fingers touched the end of the Cang Godhood Sword, everyone heard a sound and saw the blood that dripped from the Sword Body.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>A loud and clear roar of a dragon could be heard and the illusionary Golden Fate Dragon rose into the sky and shattered the frost on the ground. Rao Yaoyao was on its back and they soared into the sky as they battled with the Frost Ferret.</p><p>Half of the frost was cleared away.</p><p>With the appearance of the Golden Fate Dragon, even with the power of a Demi-Saint, Elder Han’s influence on the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes was cut off.</p><p>His attacks no longer had any effect on Rao Yaoyao, much less Ye Xiao and Chen Tan, who she protected and were behind her.</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>When he saw this, Elder Han laughed out loud. As he flapped his wings, the void buzzed and cracked. “Ants, you dare to test the might of a Demi-Saint with the help of the Xuan Cang Divine Sword? Do you know how to spell the word ‘death’?”</p><p>Without waiting for a response, the Frost Ferret rose into the air again.</p><p>The Hall of Unforgivable Crimes’ tall dome was large enough to accommodate a giant’s leap and was originally above the clouds. With Elder Han’s leap, he folded up the wings on his back to protect himself, and the dome fell apart.</p><p>It wasn’t over yet. His wings suddenly spread out when it reached the highest point.</p><p>“Boom boom boom!”</p><p>The entire dome of the Great Hall was instantly blown away by the violent frosty air.</p><p>Under the onslaught of the Demi-Saint’s power, everything shattered.</p><p>The explosion seemed to have triggered the power core of the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes.</p><p>However, before the great array was formed, the Frost Ferret opened its mouth and spat out a cold stream of starlight.</p><p>“The Ganges River!”</p><p>At this moment, time seemed to have come to a standstill.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou watched as the space at the top of the sky exploded. Under the guidance of Elder Han, the spatial fragment that even he didn’t dare to step into obediently drew out its power, and a large amount of starlight flowed out.</p><p>No one knew how long nor how wide it was.</p><p>It was vast and misty, like the stars and fog.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t understand this move.</p><p>He didn’t sense any danger. Even when the starlight poured into his body, he didn’t sense any abnormalities.</p><p>But the next second, a clear light flashed in his mind, and he suddenly realized something.</p><p>Spirit Awakening!</p><p>The Information Bar jumped.</p><p>“+(Ambushed, Passive Points+) +1.”</p><p>“+(Threatened. Passive Points,+)+1.”</p><p>“+(Attacked, Passive Points+)+1.”</p><p>Almost at the same time, Xu Xiaoshou was about to blurt out the words ‘Vanishing Technique’, but he suppressed his impulse as hisPerception swept over Ye Xiao and Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>“Acalanatha!”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou’s body was surrounded by a faint golden light, the Frost Ferretabove the Ninth Heaven swiped with its two front claws. Chey!</p><p>“..”</p><p>The world suddenly fell silent.</p><p>The sound in his ears suddenly disappeared.</p><p>It was as if millions of flies buzzed away in his mind.</p><p>They didn’t seem to make any sounds, but he felt a heart-wrenching pain. It was the pain that came from one’s thoughts being torn apart and cut into pieces.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
