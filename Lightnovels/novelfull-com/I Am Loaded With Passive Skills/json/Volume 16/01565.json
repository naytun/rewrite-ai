(1)</p><p>“Come out, you filthy scum!”</p><p>When Rao Yaoyao raised the Cang Godhood Sword high and slashed at the entrance of the Tian San cell, the sword light wreaked havoc and completely destroyed the seal fence. Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes almost popped out..</p><p>She really dared to?</p><p>When did she become so reckless?</p><p>Where did she get her support from? Inside, Elder Han was a Demi-Saint. Could it be that in just a few days, Rao Yaoyao had already been conferred the title of Demi-Saint?</p><p>“+(Startled, Passive Point,+)+1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou really felt that Rao Yaoyao had changed.</p><p>She had become so ruthless that she had become the kind of enemy that he hated the most. She was totally unreasonable and did not consider the consequences of her actions. She only cared about the present.</p><p>Ye Xiao felt the same way. She was shocked by Rao Yaoyao’s Transformation.</p><p>Before this, the Rao Yaoyao that she knew would definitely not make such a move.</p><p>If she didn’t completely understand Elder Han’s identity, how would Rao Yaoyao dare to let him go so easily?</p><p>To go into battle with a Demi-Saint with the power of a Sword Deity and a higher void level? Rao Yaoyao wouldn’t be so impetuous and do something so stupid!</p><p>She originally had a gentle temperament…No, to put it another way, she was a person who considered the big picture and was not willing to make a move easily. She would only strike after she had made sure that there would be no mistakes.</p><p>But now?</p><p>It was completely different!</p><p>What had brought about this change?</p><p>Ye Xiao did not believe that a person could undergo such a big Transformation in such a short time.</p><p>She looked around her and thought that Rao Yaoyao might have brought some hidden help.</p><p>Perhaps the person was a Demi-Saint?</p><p>But why would a Demi-Saint need to hide and not show their tracks?</p><p>After she searched for a while, Ye Xiao still could not find any traces of the so-called Demi-Saint. She was a little confused.</p><p>Did this mean that Rao Yaoyao really wanted to face the Saint on her own?</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>While the two of them were deep in thought, the door to the Tian San cell that had its seal broken by a sword, was suddenly filled with strong frosty cold air.</p><p>The quality, the quantity…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could tell at a glance that this was a few hundred times more powerful than the ice wings that had protected him earlier. The energy capacity rose as if there was no end to it.</p><p>“Demi-Saint’s Power!”</p><p>Before this, it was only a faint Demi-saint’s might, that already made Xu Xiaoshou’s heart palpitate.</p><p>However, he had also mastered the Holy Power, so he could not feel anything when he was not the main target.</p><p>But now, when the frosty white cold air surged violently, the Demi-Saint’s pressure was completely suppressed and could not be hidden!</p><p>This was almost equivalent to Jiang Buyi’s energy capacity before he lost his temper. It was even more than that…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked because the seal had not been completely broken yet. Elder Han’s power was already displayed for everyone to see in the Tian San cell.</p><p>Therefore, Elder Han’s actual strength was probably more powerful and above that of Jiang Buyi’s!</p><p>Was he really an old Demi-Saint? He didn’t know how ancient it was, but to be locked up in such a hellish place like the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes, he couldn’t be anyone weak!</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>Loud laughter came from the cell. Elder Han really didn’t expect that things would develop in this direction-in the direction of his release!</p><p>“Good move, Sword Deity Rao, please give it a few more strikes.”</p><p>“If you want to fight, I’ll fight with you at any time. If you have the guts, break the seal completely!”</p><p>Ye Xiao, who hovered above the Necromancer, wanted to say something but stopped.</p><p>In the end, her eyes flickered as she stared at the indifferent Rao Yaoyao and swallowed back her words of dissuasion.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao wasn’t stupid, but if she was, she wouldn’t have been the Ruler of the red-clothed people.</p><p>She wasn’t weak either. If she was weak, she wouldn’t have been able to obtain the title of Seven Sword Deity.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s surname was Rao. There were also many people in the Holy Divine Palace who disapproved of her. They thought that her surname was Rao, so she had obtained everything she shouldn’t have.</p><p>Indeed, Rao Yaoyao’s battle record wasn’t that brilliant. It seemed that she couldn’t even compare to Gou Wuyue, let alone Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>But this would depend on who she was being compared to and who she competed against!</p><p>How many ‘Dao Qiongcangs’ and how many ‘Gou Wuyues’ were there in the world?</p><p>How many people were qualified to challenge the Giants of the top factions, such as Bazhun’an, to challenge one or two or even to wrestle with the other?</p><p>They didn’t know that even someone as strong as Dao Qiongcang was ranked behind Kui Leihan and Bazhun’an in the Songs of the Ten High Nobles. It did not matter whether this ranking was superior or inferior, but it must have been influenced by some subjective factors in the eyes of some people, right?</p><p>If it was anyone else in Rao Yaoyao’s position, would they definitely be able to do better than her?</p><p>No!</p><p>There was a high chance that even their corpses would have turned cold!</p><p>Ye Xiao had always felt that the surname ‘Rao’ was what made Rao Yaoyao successful, but more than that, it was because Yaoyao had been suppressed by the ‘Rao’ surname.</p><p>Too many people couldn’t see her brilliance and felt that her current achievements were taken for granted by the Raos or were even not enough.</p><p>But from another point of view, what if Rao Yaoyao’s surname wasn’t Rao?</p><p>If she had a different surname, she would have joined the ten-member council of the Holy Divine Palace as a woman and would be in charge of the clean-up of all the Ghost Beasts in the Five Domains of the continent and maintained the peace and prosperity until now. However, no one cared about her great achievements because of the word ‘Ghost Beast’.</p><p>Could an outsider achieve such a feat?</p><p>There weren’t many Raos in the world, but there weren’t too few either. There weren’t many young people in the Five Great Holy Emperor aristocratic families who loved power, but there were also quite a few…Would there be no conflict?</p><p>Why was it that only Rao Yaoyao could assume the position of the Ruler of the red-clothed people and no one else could?</p><p>Because she was the only one who could control it!</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>With a clear shout, the sword light disappeared without a trace.</p><p>The seal at the prison door, the Spiritual Array on the table, the Spiritual Thread on the huge torture instrument outside the Hall… This included a great array of every Array Eye of the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes. They were all affected and festered.</p><p>Ka!</p><p>Cracks appeared in all directions, and even the space nodes in the void shattered.</p><p>The unchanging rules of the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes were changed at this moment, as if some balance had been broken.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
