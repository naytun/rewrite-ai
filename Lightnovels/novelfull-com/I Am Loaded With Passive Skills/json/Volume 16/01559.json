Not only had he heard of it, but it was like the sound of thunder in his ears.</p><p>What was the purpose of the Yunlun Mountain Range’s Imperial City Trial? It was to compete for the thirty six spots in the Holy Palace Trial.</p><p>Where would the Holy Palace Trial be held?</p><p>Outsiders might not know, but after the battle in the Eighth Palace ended and through what Bazhun’an had personally told him, Xu Xiaoshou knew that this Holy Palace Trial would most likely be held in the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>In the past, he didn’t realize the significance of Bazhun’an’s three words.</p><p>But now that he thought about it, how could the information given by this person be false?</p><p>According to the Eighth Sword Deity, his next path was to go to the Imperial City Trial, to the Four Symbols Secret Realm, to the Holy Palace and to climb the Saint mountain.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had an appointment at the Dongtianwang City.</p><p>Things were a bit more complicated than he thought!</p><p>As a result, after numerous trials, his companions were still fighting with the Innate Stage and the Master Stage. He had come to the Abyss Island on his own and his enemies were all the higher void levels and Demi-Saints.</p><p>You could say that the Four Symbols Secret Realm was a piece of cake and Bazhun’an did not set up a trap for him, but now Xu Xiaoshou didn’t believe it at all.</p><p>The Ran Ming ruins mentioned by Elder Han was in the Four Symbols Secret Realm, and the path Bazhun’an had arranged also included the Four Symbols Secret Realm. How could there be such a coincidence in this world?</p><p>Absolutely not!</p><p>“Eighth Brother, are you the one behind this?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost questioned Elder Han on the spot if he was one of Bazhun’an’s men.</p><p>It was as if Eighth brother had arranged for a passerby who was a Demi-Saint, who encouraged him to take the next step as soon as they met.</p><p>If you don’t leave, I’ll give you a push!</p><p>But in front of him was the abyss!</p><p>However, he did not dare to ask and he did not know whether this Demi-Saint passerby was a friend or foe. When he asked this question, it would definitely reveal that Chen Tan had a close relationship with the Saint Servant.</p><p>Anyone with eyes could see that this was either Xu Xiaoshou or Lei Shuangxing or even the Saint Servant, the third young Swordsman. He could kill them all anyway.</p><p>Wasn’t this seeking death?</p><p>“Little Brother, why aren’t you talking? Have you heard of the Four Symbols Secret Realm?”</p><p>Elder Han’s teasing voice came out from the cell again.</p><p>He was really the most unscrupulous Demi-Saint Xu Xiaoshou had ever met.</p><p>Just a moment ago, he addressed him as ‘Big Brother’ out of fear. The next second, because he had revealed his strength as a Demi-Saint, he now addressed him as ‘Little Brother’ in order to get closer to him.</p><p>“I’ve heard a little about it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t hide the fact that he knew about it.</p><p>Because Elder Han’s words just now had indeed shocked him, and Ye Xiao must have seen his subconscious reaction.</p><p>But so what if they knew each other?</p><p>The Holy Palace Trial had been held in the Four Symbols Secret Realm before, so which Spiritual Cultivator wouldn’t want to go to the Holy Palace? To get some information about the Holy Palace’s Trial?</p><p>This naturally included the Four Symbols Secret Realm!</p><p>“I can tell that you’re very interested, kid…”</p><p>Elder Han’s voice came out again.</p><p>“I’m also very interested. How about this? Let me out and we can go and look for the treasure together?”</p><p>“This world is too boring. Only secrets and treasures can pique people like us. Isn’t that where the joy of adventure is?”</p><p>Only a ghost would want to go on an adventure with you!</p><p>After he understood how the God Execution Order worked, Xu Xiaoshou just wanted to burn all bridges and seal up the hole at the prison door.</p><p>“Then, don’t wait for too long…”</p><p>Elder Han immediately cried out and his voice contained a nauseating tinge of coquettishness.</p><p>“I’m serious. It’s really boring to be a Demi-Saint. If you let me out, I’ll do three things for you. How about it?”</p><p>He paused, and his words were filled with killing intent. “The first thing I’ll do is to kill the woman in front of you. I can tell that you don’t like her.”</p><p>“Everyone has the heart to appreciate beauty.” Xu Xiaoshou refuted.</p><p>“Come on, you appreciate beauty? Do you really think I can’t feel your killing intent?”</p><p>Was I really that obvious?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. He glanced at Ye Xiao and found that the Dark Division Chief was still unmoved.</p><p>She really was such a cool character!</p><p>They were talking about her and teasing her to such an extent, yet she could still keep her cool?</p><p>“You wanted to kill her, didn’t you?” Xu Xiaoshou chuckled.</p><p>“Oh?” As Elder Han continued to release cold air, he sniffed as if he was curious why Chen Tan said that.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t seem to notice Elder Han’s minute movements and continued.</p><p>“First, without any external help, you can’t get out of this cell. Even if the seal and bars have rotted, you won’t be able to get out for a while. That’s why you tried to persuade me to join forces with you.”</p><p>“Second, you’re not human!”</p><p>His tone was very certain, as if he already had enough evidence in his hands.</p><p>“What!”</p><p>In the cell, Elder Han laughed sharply.</p><p>However, his laughter came to an abrupt end after that.</p><p>“Ha…ha…ha…”</p><p>“Kid, are you stupid?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind did not contain any Spiritual Light, but he could still hear the guilt in these words, apart from the fact that he was not stupid.</p><p>“I’ve been wandering around the Abyss Island for so long. Besides the Void Attendants, there are only outsiders. There has never been a native. Why would you, a Demi-Saint be locked up in this Hall of Unforgivable Crimes?”</p><p>When he glanced at Ye Xiao, Xu Xiaoshou found that Ye Xiao still remained motionless.</p><p>He knew that Ye Xiao was a shrewd lady and must have known what he knew, but he still spoke without any scruples.</p><p>“It could be that you’re really from an ancient era and have been locked up until now, but as a virtuous Demi-Saint, why were you locked up in the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes Where were the other Demi-Saints on the Abyss Island? You’re the only one alive here?”</p><p>“Ordinary people do not know this, but I understand this all too clearly…The Abyss Island is a Land of Exile!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
