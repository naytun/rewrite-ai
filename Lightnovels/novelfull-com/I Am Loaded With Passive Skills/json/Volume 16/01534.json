Was it because of the environment of the All-Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavillion?</p><p>Or could it be that from the start, these two were unrelated people who walked their own paths?</p><p>“In the future, don’t trust anyone other than me.” Xu Xiaoshou touched his little junior sister’s head.</p><p>“Oh,” Mu Zixi nodded. She looked up and asked, “What if he can also transform and turn into you?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately choked.</p><p>This was an extremely messed up question.</p><p>“Hehe.” Hearing this, Mei Siren laughed. “There’s no need to think so much. At least for now, he doesn’t have any ill intentions toward you. He even gave you the ancestral shadow staff. Just as he said, everything may not develop in the worst way. You don’t have to worry too much.”</p><p>It was precisely because he did not know if the ancestral shadow staff was a blessing or curse that he felt uneasy holding it… Xu Xiaoshou rubbed the hand in his arms, suddenly rose up, and threw it into the sky.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>A stream of light streaked past, attracting the gazes of the three.</p><p>In the next second, the three of them looked away from the distance and returned to the staff in Xu Xiaoshou’s arms.</p><p>The staff lay there quietly, unable to be thrown away or sent out. It was like a maggot in his bones, a curse that he could never get rid of.</p><p>“Such a great item, hehe…” Xu Xiaoshou laughed dryly. “Even a demi-saint can’t take away my shadow staff. This is great!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong sighed. As expected of Xu Xiaoshou, even in the midst of suffering, he was still trying to find joy.</p><p>“I think you should ask the teacher about this.”</p><p>“At that time, my teacher was an arrogant genius. I don’t believe that he didn’t find an excuse to fight with such a mysterious person after knowing about them.”</p><p>“In the War of the Ten High Nobles, they were in the same world, so they must have contacted each other.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong couldn’t come up with a good solution, so he could only tell Xu Xiaoshou, “Find my teacher and you might have the answer. Don’t be afraid. You have my teacher behind you. He doesn’t have any mercy for anyone.”</p><p>Received comfort. Passive value,+1.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou heard this, he was relieved.</p><p>Indeed, no matter how ruthless Kong Yuhen was, could he be more ruthless than Bazhun’an in his youth?</p><p>Without any delay, Xu Xiaoshou took out his communication bead and found that he couldn’t contact Bazhun’an in the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>“Keep walking forward, don’t look back.”</p><p>Mei Siren laughed when he saw this. He knocked Xu Xiaoshou’s head with his paper fan and said, “If he really wants to touch you, he has to get past me first. Even if the time attribute is unpredictable and I can’t beat him, he’s not invincible. I can always call out someone who can help to beat him.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong also laughed.</p><p>It was hard for him to imagine the scene of Master Siren shaking his head after losing to someone.</p><p>For this old senior to be alive to this extent, his power must be great. What kind of scene would it be when the time came? Would it be an apocalyptic-level war?</p><p>“Master Siren is right. Now, let’s return to the First Hall of Sins.” He smiled and nodded.</p><p>“Yes.” Xu Xiaoshou felt relaxed quite a bit. He had so many people behind him, including the will of a Saint Emperor. It was unlikely that he would suddenly die.</p><p>Kong Yuhen seemed to be right about one thing, that he was too anxious.</p><p>He couldn’t always think of the worst. Now, he should think more. He had the ancestral shadow staff in his hands. Who cared about it? How to use it was the most important thing!</p><p>“Let’s explore the First Hall of Sins first.” Xu Xiaoshou echoed.</p><p>Looking around, the interior of the First Hall of Sins was shrouded in dark mist, and it was tens of thousands of times larger than the All-Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion.</p><p>This was indeed a maze.</p><p>However, just the small path in the labyrinth was tall and wide enough to allow several large void servants to walk side by side in the outside world.</p><p>Such a grand and majestic environment, even with the cover of the dark mist, gave people a more carefree and relaxed feeling than the narrow and cramped space of the All-Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that his anxiety had disappeared quite a bit.</p><p>Suddenly, his vision focused, and his “perception” also passed through the mist. He saw a small figure at the end of the maze path in the distance.</p><p>He was wearing a luxurious robe, his black hair tied into a bun, his face was beautiful, and his eyes were bright. There was a door-shaped wood carving accessory tied around his neck. He was sitting in front of the tea table, raising his cup high and nodding to him.</p><p>After a slight smile, the blurry figure burst like a bubble and disappeared.</p><p>“A friend…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
