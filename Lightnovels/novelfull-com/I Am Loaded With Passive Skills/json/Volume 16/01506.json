You’ve been sleeping the whole time?” Xu Xiaoshou was amused. He pointed toward the direction of the Yuan Mansion and tried his best to suppress his laughter. “Then, Senior Dragon Apricot, do you know that you’ve already moved?”</p><p>“Moved?”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit’s eyes suddenly froze.</p><p>It paused for a long moment before it seemed to realize what the word meant. It immediately shook its head and scanned the surrounding environment.</p><p>The smaller environment still had the unique and familiar aura of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, but the bigger space seemed to have really changed.</p><p>“Where is this place?” A hint of confusion showed in the Dragon Apricot Spirit’s sleepy eyes.</p><p>This place didn’t seem to be Abyss Island anymore, but the atmosphere seemed more suitable for the growth of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>It must have been very satisfied with this place. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been so reluctant to rouse itself until its Dragon Apricot had almost been plucked off twice.</p><p>“This is the Yuan Mansion that belongs to me. I’m determined to create a place that is suitable for the growth of the Holy Medicine and Divine Herbs, as well as a place where ancient beings can cultivate and recuperate.” Xu Xiaoshou was careful with his words and almost blurted out, “This could also be the best nursing home for you.”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit scanned its surroundings and easily sensed that this was The Beginning of Chaos World, filled with dense vitality.</p><p>Not only did this place have an environment that was more suitable for the growth of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, but there were also a large number of other spiritual plants and a strong fragrance of Elixirs.</p><p>He could also sense the other powers of the Nine Great Ancestral Trees, such as the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch and the Bodhi Root…</p><p>There was no lingering aura of the aftermath of a great battle. It was not like the Forest of Miracles that was always chaotic, but was more peaceful and quiet.</p><p>In addition to these benefits, this world also had a bit of the Primordial Purple Mist. Even if he did not inhale this Violet Qi, it was obviously more comfortable to sleep in its midst.</p><p>“A heavenly paradise, very good.” The Dragon Apricot Spirit nodded in satisfaction, and then laid its head on the crown of the Dragon Apricot tree. It said lazily, “Since that’s the case, I will continue with my sleep.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou went numb.</p><p>What was this, a Dragon with a laid back attitude?</p><p>In his Perception, the appearance of the Dragon Apricot Spirit had already attracted the attention of Lei Xi’er, who hid in the broken tower.</p><p>This girl carried Greedy the White Cat Spirit and watched them from afar. At this time, she was clearly shocked by the Dragon Apricot Spirit’s words as her face was filled with confusion and puzzlement.</p><p>Suddenly, the Dragon Apricot Spirit’s voice halted abruptly. The Dragon head that had been about to fall into deep sleep also suddenly lifted itself from the crown of the Dragon Apricot tree, as if it sensed that something was wrong.</p><p>In addition to the human’s words about “moved”, the Dragon Apricot Spirit suddenly thought of something and sobered up a little. “This place is no longer Abyss Island?” “Yes, that’s right.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit was furious, and howled in anger as it said, “I have been ordered to guard the Forest of Miracles on Abyss Island. It is the ‘core’ and cannot be moved without permission. How dare you move the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer?”</p><p>It finally realized that it had been moved to another world!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart tightened as he felt great pressure. If he did not handle this well, he might lose his life.</p><p>But he bit the bullet and said meekly, “But this place is more suitable for you, Senior. You don’t like it here? Or do you want me to send you back to Abyss Island?”</p><p>After a pause, Xu Xiaoshou pointed to a large patch of Holy Medicine in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer and said, “They seem to like this place very much. If you don’t like it, I’m afraid they’ll have to follow you back to Abyss Island.”</p><p>The Holy Medicine had spirits within them and they swayed in agreement with Xu Xiaoshou’s words. They were full of disdain for the environment of Abyss Island.</p><p>“You’re right.” The Dragon Apricot Spirit’s eyes showed that it was clearly conflicted. How could it not know that the environment here was much better than that of the Forest of Miracles?</p><p>“Senior, whose orders were you following?” Xu Xiaoshou suddenly asked.</p><p>“No comment.” The Dragon Apricot Spirit clearly didn’t want to answer.</p><p>“Then, Senior, are you protecting the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer or the Forest of Miracles? Is there a contract that you have to guard that place to the death?” Xu Xiaoshou knew that the answer was no. Otherwise, how could the Dragon Apricot sleep so deeply and was not even aware when its nest had been moved?</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit’s answer was as expected.</p><p>“Since that’s the case, the Dragon Cave will stay, the Forest of Miracles will stay and this blessed paradise as well. The environment here is obviously not bad, right?” Xu Xiaoshou spread out his hands and said with confidence.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit was silent for a long time before it finally spoke again, “That is true.”</p><p>“You’re really the apathetic type!” Xu Xiaoshou thought.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was slightly amused by the attitude of the Dragon Apricot Spirit.</p><p>He turned around and saw that Lei Xi’er’s expression was the same as his, stunned but also a little amused. He did not dare to look at her for fear that they would both burst out laughing.</p><p>Even if he had not taken out the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale, Xu Xiaoshou knew that his life would not be in danger.</p><p>He became a little braver, and stared directly at the Dragon Apricot who was on the crown of the Dragon Apricot tree and asked.</p><p>“Senior, as the master of this world, I urgently need the Dragon Apricot to increase my strength. Only then will I be able to better protect this paradise with you. I wonder if I can harvest one?”</p><p>As Lord of the world, the Dragon Apricot Spirit’s eyes swiveled toward him. As an ancient creature that had survived to this day, how could it not know the thoughts of the human in front of it?</p><p>But at the moment, the Dragon Apricot Spirit didn’t want to be too calculative.</p><p>In any case, the Dragon Apricot was an excess overflow of its own power, and there were no benefits if it kept them. These fruits that it had been ordered to protect had to be left for others in the end.</p><p>Now that its abode had been moved, and the people who gave the orders were nowhere to be found, why would it still need to stick to their principles?</p><p>If it had the energy and mind, it would be better for it to guard the Beginning of Chaos World and let the Primordial Purple Mist strengthen itself!</p><p>This place was indeed many times better than the Forest of Miracles!</p><p>When it had this thought, the Dragon Apricot Spirit felt relieved. Now it became bored and retracted into its main body’s trunk, closed its eyes, and said languidly.</p><p>“Then you pick one. I’ll sleep first.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
