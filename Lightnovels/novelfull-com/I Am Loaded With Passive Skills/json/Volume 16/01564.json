In reality, it’s impossible for me to complete this mission.”</p><p>“That’s the entire situation. I’ve told you everything now. You can form your own conclusion.”</p><p>“But I’m determined to stand on your side. That was my bottom line, my principle, and the way of survival that I’ve concluded in the Southern Region-I would never have anything to do with the dark powers!”</p><p>As soon as he said this, the entire Hall fell into dead silence.</p><p>Ye Xiao was stunned for a moment. She had not heard such a conversation between Elder Han and Chen Tan, but she had overheard Chen Tan say words like ‘White Vein’ Third Ancestor bloodline had appeared’.</p><p>According to what Chen Tan had said earlier, his knowledge of the Abyss Island was limited to that it was a Land of Exile. There might be more than one Demi-Saint imprisoned here.</p><p>However, the distinction between the Inner and Outer islands of Abyss Island and the power structure of the Inner Island…</p><p>Even if he asked 99% of the people on the Abyss Island, he wouldn’t be able to find that out, let alone an evil cultivator from the Southern Region!</p><p>Even Ye Xiao had only heard of the term ‘Third Ancestor of the White Vein bloodline’ and did not know what it meant.</p><p>She immediately turned to look at Rao Yaoyao, only to discover that the Ruler of the red-clothed people’s face was extremely cold. Her killing intent had shifted from Chen Tan to the cell door.</p><p>There was also silence in the Tian San cell.</p><p>However, at the next moment, a hysterical roar erupted from the cell.</p><p>“Chen! Tan!”</p><p>“Slander! He’s slandering me! I’m not a Ghost Beast…D*mn you Chen Tan!”</p><p>There was no way for him to explain it!</p><p>With a loud bang, the Spiritual Array woven from Spirit Threads at the door of the cell was suddenly shattered by the frosty white cold air.</p><p>The boundless ice-type energy was suddenly released and formed into a pair of bat-like ice wings in the air, which then slashed towards the worthless Chen Tan.</p><p>“Sword Deity Rao, save me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou covered his head and fled like a rat. His pupils dilated in shock, as if he was overwhelmed by the Dem-saint’s attack. In his heart, he had already prepared the ‘Acalanatha’, Vanishing Technique and the ‘take the easy way out’ abilities.</p><p>But if Rao Yaoyao could not save him, he had to reveal some of his trump cards.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>The Cang Godhood Sword was gently waved in the air, and the melodious sound of the sword cries rang through the Great Hall.</p><p>In the next second, the sword light was like the wind that brought with it streams of endless cold air as it slashed towards the ice wings that were headed for Chen Tan.</p><p>“Secular Heart Refinement!”</p><p>There were no fancy special effects. This simple and unadorned Sword Light was like a casual slash. It was not even comparable to the power of a Demi-Saint…No, it contained only a fraction of Ye Xiao’s God of Death power!</p><p>However, Elder Han’s wings quivered violently and the frosty white air that seeped out of the hole instantly cut off the connection between the attack and the ice wings in the distance.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>The ice wings that had lost control were easily split into two and melted into ice water.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was finally at ease, and he could hide his three life-saving trump cards.</p><p>“Emotion Sword technique, Secular Sword…”</p><p>As someone who had suffered badly from this sword strike, Xu Xiaoshou completely understood what Elder Han did.</p><p>The more a person had ill-intentions was, the harder it would be for them to go through this ‘Secular Heart Refinement’.</p><p>Elder Han halted his attack at the last moment because he was afraid that Rao Yaoyao’s sword would chase after him, cross the cell, and cut into his seven emotions and six desires.</p><p>Whether he could evade the attack of the Secular Sword at that time was another matter. As long as Rao Yaoyao exerted her strength, the muddleheaded Elder Han would probably reveal some secrets he didn’t want to reveal.</p><p>This Demi-Saint should be able to evade and escape being controlled by the Secular Sword…</p><p>But what if?</p><p>Everyone was afraid of accidents, especially a man of unknown origin like Elder Han.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s sword floated down from the void and landed in front of Chen Tan. She tilted her head and said.</p><p>“You step back, leave this to me.”</p><p>“+(Protected, Passive Points),+1.”</p><p>Ah!</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou stared at her beautiful face, his eyes shone and he felt extremely satisfied.</p><p>This sense of security was so immense!</p><p>“Keep an eye on him. Leave Elder Han to me.” Rao Yaoyao raised her eyes to look at Ye Xiao again and indicated that they could not afford to lose Chen Tan’s God Execution Order and that they could deal with it later.</p><p>Ye Xiao nodded silently.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have heard something unbelievable. He asked in a daze, “Sword Deity Rao, what are you trying to do? Don’t mess around!”</p><p>From the looks of it, you a Sword Deity want to fight against Elder Han? Fighting a Demi-Saint?</p><p>This is simply crazy!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao, however, slanted her sword and silently strode towards the Tian San cell.</p><p>With every step she took, the aura on her body increased. When she reached the door, a faint Holy Energy had already descended upon the surroundings.</p><p>From the Dongtianwang City to the Yunlun Mountain Range, to the Lone Cliff and to the Abyss Island…Rao Yaoyao had a clear understanding of herself.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang, Bazhun’an and even Xu Xiaoshou could play with tactics and she too could play with them.</p><p>After a dream, one had to return to reality.</p><p>“Ancient Swordsman, press forward with indomitable will!”</p><p>This was the most original path, and also the path that suited him the most.</p><p>The heretics had taught him, Huang Quan had taught him, Night Guardian had taught him, Teng Shanhai had taught him, Jiang Buyi had taught him, and even Xu Xiaoshou had taught himself…one principle:</p><p>Whenever in doubt, attack immediately!</p><p>He would rather kill the wrong person than let him off!</p><p>“The moment a person is indecisive, the sword would become blunt.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
