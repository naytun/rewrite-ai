(1)</p><p>“Oww…”</p><p>A weak dragon’s roar resounded throughout the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit that was entrenched on top of the Dragon Apricot nodded its dragon head in satisfaction. After seeing that the Dragon Apricot was indeed useful to that human brat, it was finally at ease and disappeared.</p><p>Just now, it even thought that its Dragon Apricot had turned into poison!</p><p>However, it was obvious that this was not the case. As long as the process and results of the Dragon Apricot’s enhancement effect on humans were still within the normal range.</p><p>Hmm, if the process was not normal, it should be the human boy’s own problem.</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had taken a long time to recover from the side effects of the drug, was left completely paralyzed on the ground and could not even look up at the sky.</p><p>“I survived…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed silently, his face as pale as a sheet of paper.</p><p>It was evident that after he took the Dragon Apricot, his body was in an extremely good condition. However he felt as if he was on the verge of death, and all that was left was a feeling of complete powerlessness.</p><p>“What a clear world it is!”</p><p>As he tried his best to roll his eyes, Xu Xiaoshou could clearly feel the super-strong effect the Dragon Apricot had brought to his body even without using his ‘Perception’.</p><p>Even though he was paralyzed at this moment, his eyesight was thousands of times better than before.</p><p>The dust in the air, the tiny spiritual physique and even the vague life forms that he had never noticed before appeared clearly in his sight.</p><p>“So my Yuan Mansion has already given birth to life forms?”</p><p>Even though these weak creatures were not even comparable to mayflies, Xu Xiaoshou did not know how to name them.</p><p>However, the appearance of a ‘spirit’ and the birth of independent life-forms meant that the Yuan Mansion had already started to evolve in the direction of the Greater World.</p><p>In time, this place would become an extradimensional space.</p><p>If he continued to add the Treasure of suppressing barrier to help this world evolve, and then used the Dragon Apricot from the Nine Great Ancestral Trees as a base, this place might really evolve into something similar to the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>However, that would take a long time.</p><p>“Is this the power of a ‘Dragon’?” he asked.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes continued to roll. He could see everything clearly within a fifty-mile radius as long as there was nothing that blocked his sight.</p><p>Such a change was already extremely unbelievable, because Xu Xiaoshou did not even use his spiritual senses or Perception at this moment. He was purely relying on his physical strength to observe the world.</p><p>“Just a single Dragon Apricot can bring about such an effect?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was quite shocked. After his body recovered a little, he continued to examine the Transformation in his body, and suddenly felt that he had discovered some secret.</p><p>He didn’t need to deliberately use his Perception. As if by instinct, Xu Xiaoshou could sense the ‘flow’ in the air.</p><p>“Wind!”</p><p>With merely a thought, he didn’t use his Spiritual Source nor did he summon Hidden Bitter, his body, which had lain limp on the ground, actually ‘borrowed’ the trajectory of these airflows and slowly floated into the air.</p><p>“D*mn!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>He could fly with just his physical strength?</p><p>“Dragon?”</p><p>“Summoning the wind and rain?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hadn’t felt the ability to summon the rain yet, but he felt that the ability to call the wind had been engraved into his blood and had become an innate ability.</p><p>After he twisted and turned in the air and adapted to the ability to fly purely with his physical body, Xu Xiaoshou keenly discovered that the Transformation brought by the Dragon Apricot were not limited to only this.</p><p>He clenched his fist and activated his physical strength. Illusionary golden scales appeared on his skin.</p><p>“Dragon scales?”</p><p>“No! It had not reached the height of dragon scales yet.”</p><p>“But the appearance of these ‘scales’ can double the power of my physical body, whether it’s for attack, defense, or speed!”</p><p>Once again, Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>When he used all his strength to activate the hidden higher potential in his physical body, he felt that the ‘scales’ were more pronounced and his physical strength continued to rise.</p><p>From one, to double, to triple.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou only felt he had reached the limit when the corners of his forehead began to ache and it felt as if something was about to erupt.</p><p>“If I use all my strength, it will be five times that of my previous physical strength!”</p><p>“Wouldn’t a punch like this be equivalent to five punches stacked together?”</p><p>“No, you can’t count it that way. This is actually equivalent to the combination of the attacks of five Sovereign Physique. Moreover, all of them have my passive skills.”</p><p>“The amplification of one punch is not just five times. It’s even possible that it is fifty times more!</p><p>His bones creaked and his blood flowed like a tide. Xu Xiaoshou felt the surface of his body start to burn and turn red and steaming.</p><p>He restrained the urge to use all his strength and had an endless expression of amazement.</p><p>“It’s too strong!”</p><p>It should be noted that it was only a single Dragon Apricot that had brought about this Transformation!</p><p>“Was this the power of the Holy Medicine?”</p><p>“My current physical strength can almost kill an ordinary Sovereign Physique in seconds, right? In other words, I can kill Elder Sang in seconds?”</p><p>“Even if it was the previous me, he could definitely defeat me with one punch!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression was strange. The Dragon Apricot’s amplification was too strong, so strong that it exceeded all his expectations.</p><p>If he could increase the level of his passive skill by himself, he believed that his Extended Passive Skill would strengthen and become higher than Level 1. It would definitely be upgraded by a few levels.</p><p>“Could this be the effect of the ‘power of the Dragon ancestor’?”</p><p>“Then, if I consume 99 Dragon Apricots and obtain the complete ‘ancestral dragon power’, I should be able to tear a giant dragon apart? ”</p><p>Surprised, Xu Xiaoshou immediately understood why the Transformation was so powerful.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
