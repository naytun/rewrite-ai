(3)</p><p>He wore his clothes in a haphazard manner, as if he was not used to it.</p><p>However, he did not care about it anymore. He waved his hand and said that. He seemed to like the tone of ‘bestowment’. He did not know where he had learned it from.</p><p>“What’s your true Ghost Beast form?” Rao Yaoyao actually stopped the fight and asked.</p><p>Elder Han looked over with a smile. He looked harmless, but his tone was a little teasing. “That’s two questions, right? I’ve already said that I’m not a Ghost Beast.”</p><p>“What is your true form?” Rao Yaoyao continued to ask.</p><p>Elder Han was elated. His big black eyes narrowed into two cute lines, and then he opened his eyes and said seriously, “This…It’s inconvenient to tell you.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao appeared to be in a trance.</p><p>At a certain moment, she even felt that this Elder Han had changed into Xu Xiaoshou. Everything he said was nonsense, and normal people couldn’t communicate with him at all.</p><p>Her expression turned cold along with the surrounding environment. She sneered and said.</p><p>“Alright, then one last question…As a Ghost Beast, how long will it take after your escape for you to regain your original cultivation level?”</p><p>As soon as these words came out, the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes froze for a full moment.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly had a moment of enlightenment and understood why Rao Yaoyao had dared to attack.</p><p>If her judgment was correct, and Elder Han was indeed lying, and his nature was that of a Ghost Beast, then according to her previous knowledge of a Ghost Beast…</p><p>Even Feng Yujin had to attach himself to Mo Mo after he was freed, and his cultivation had dropped by more than one level.</p><p>As a result, at the Tiansang Spirit Palace’s Tian Xuan Gate, he could only display the Master Stage strength because of the small world’s suppression and the restriction imposed on the Ghost Beast Host Body.</p><p>It was the same for Patriarch Wuji.</p><p>His Ghost Beast Host Body was relatively easy to find, so he found Liu Changqing, who was at the Cutting Path Stage.</p><p>But that was all.</p><p>The Divine Secret was said to be known only to Dao Qiongcang, who was second to Patriarch Wuji. Because of the restrictions of the Ghost Beast Host Body, he could not even afford to be distracted while he fought with Yi, and could only use most of his power to block Yi’s escape route.</p><p>Of the two above, one was a Holy Emperor and the other was a Demi-Saint, but after their escape, they were left with less than 10% of their strength.</p><p>Now, Elder Han was also a Demi-Saint…</p><p>If he was really a Ghost Beast, what kind of situation would he be in if he had not even found his host body?</p><p>The peak of his strength?</p><p>Or even worse?</p><p>Under such circumstances, why wouldn’t Rao Yaoyao dare to challenge him?</p><p>“However, all of this was based on the assumption that Elder Han was really a Ghost Beast…Where did Rao Yaoyao get her courage from? She dared to make a move even when she didn’t have a five point grasp?” Xu Xiaoshou gave Rao Yaoyao a strange look. She had changed, she had really changed.</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>Elder Han smiled and stared intently at Rao Yaoyao. He shook his head slightly and said, “I’ll say it one last time. I’m not a Ghost Beast, but I can answer your question.”</p><p>He raised his hand and inhaled the fresh air of freedom.</p><p>Not long after, he exhaled two frosty streams of air from his mouth and nose.</p><p>“The answer is, “It’ll be quick!”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Elder Han’s relaxed palm suddenly clenched into a fist.</p><p>At the same time, the Demi-Saint’s sudden surge of pressure almost materialized and pressed down from the sky accompanied by the sound of thunder.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao, Ye Xiao, and Xu Xiaoshou were all still immersed in the state of relaxation from earlier and were immediately stunned by the pressure of this Demi-Saint.</p><p>But they were all still prepared, and soon they used different methods to deal with it.</p><p>However, in the blink of an eye, a black cold current erupted from Elder Han’s body-the power of the Ghost Beast!</p><p>“Frosty Heavens Cold Domain!”</p><p>As his two fists smashed against each other, a cold light shot out from the depths of Elder Han’s eyes. With the soles of his feet as the center, a black cold current spread out in all directions.</p><p>In an instant, the space within the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes that belonged to the Hall of Giants shattered inch by inch, and then froze.</p><p>Tables, pillars, torture instruments…They all turned into black ice sculptures.</p><p>The surrounding world seemed to have turned into a broken mirror, and there was no intact space. It reflected the incomplete figures of a few people scattered about.</p><p>There were fragments everywhere!</p><p>The fragments were all frozen!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao, Ye Xiao, and Xu Xiaoshou, who had just recovered from the shock, were caught off guard by the Demi-Saint’s mighty power and were frozen-it was another form of strong control!</p><p>“Ghost Beast!”</p><p>The three of them had the same thought.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao didn’t make any move. The Cang Godhood Sword in her hand shone with a green light, and the ice crystals shattered and made it difficult for them to invade the depths of her body.</p><p>With a flip of her hand, she struck out with her sword. As expected, it always made sense to attack directly when one had any doubts!</p><p>However, Elder Han did not forcefully receive her sword attack.</p><p>With a strange ‘Haha’ laugh, Elder Han’s body turned into a stream of black air. With lightning speed, he streaked past Rao Yaoyao and Ye Xiao and attacked Chen Tan, who was at the back.</p><p>The image of the black cold current appeared enlarged in his pupils.</p><p>At this moment, all the thoughts in Xu Xiaoshou’s mind exploded!</p><p>He had originally thought that he was a member of the cheering squad for this battle and only needed to applaud and cheer for Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>He would just watch until the end of the battle and choose one side to join. He didn’t have to worry about the future anyway.</p><p>However, before he could fully collect his thoughts, he realized that something was wrong with the situation. Elder Han’s actions told him…</p><p>The main character was actually him!</p><p>“Damn it, if Elder Han is a Ghost Beast, then I must be the best candidate for the Ghost Beast host body in his eyes…What was I thinking of? Waiting for death?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
