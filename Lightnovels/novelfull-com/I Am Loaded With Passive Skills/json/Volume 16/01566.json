(2)</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>At this moment, the door of the Tian San cell that was no longer sealed was kicked open from the inside and flew up into the sky with a loud bang.</p><p>The gate of the Giant’s Palace shattered into pieces as it flew through the void, and turned into shards that fell to the ground.</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>A strange, carefree laugh resounded in all directions. This outburst was filled with the euphoria of one who had been released after being suppressed for a long time.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou weakly retreated to the edge of the battlefield as he stared at Elder Han’s figure in the cell.</p><p>After the main gate was destroyed, the Tian San cell was covered in a layer of frosty white fog.</p><p>It was a little different from the darkness that he had expected. The prison cell was somewhat bright, and the layout inside resembled an ice crystal cave that could refract light on multiple sides.</p><p>White and blue crystal icicles hung from the sky and on the walls. The air was cold and the fog was dense.</p><p>The prison cell was very large and matched the dimensions of the Great Hall.</p><p>The ice cave inside was huge, and it covered the entire area. It was practically the best home for an ice-type Spiritual Cultivator.</p><p>However, the man who emerged from the frosty mist was very small.</p><p>He was smaller than the average human being, no more than seven feet tall. His limbs were thin and lean and his skin was very white, as if he had been kept in a cold place for a long time and was frozen.</p><p>“This is Elder Han?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. This was not what he had expected.</p><p>Elder Han…From his title, he should be a tall, burly, bald man. How could he be a man who could only be described as ‘small’?</p><p>As the frosty mist swirled around him, the naked Elder Han swaggered out, without the slightest sense of shame.</p><p>He laughed as he walked.</p><p>“Hahaha…” His loud laughter suited his figure at this time. Elder Han only stopped laughing when he walked out of the cell.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw Elder Han’s face clearly.</p><p>To his surprise, it wasn’t the monkey-like face that matched his figure and strange smile.</p><p>On the contrary, Elder Han was very cute.</p><p>His eyes were round and black, almost without pupils. His skin was pale, but very smooth.</p><p>In addition, there was a long, fluffy, snow-white tail coiled around his waist. It perfectly covered his vulnerable spot and that included his front and back, as it was coiled a full circle and a half around his body.</p><p>Oh, this might also be the reason why he was so unabashed.</p><p>“Ah, this…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou blinked. He could tell at a glance that this Elder Han wasn’t human!</p><p>Normal people didn’t grow tails, and they didn’t look as strange as Elder Han.</p><p>Although it was very cute, Elder Han’s cuteness was based on the human perception of a pet’s appearance. It was not the kind of cuteness that was associated with humans.</p><p>Elder Han’s appearance was accompanied by a strong surge of frosty white cold air.</p><p>As soon as he came out of the cell, the entire Hall of Unforgivable Crimes was covered in thick frost, like a misty heavenly court.</p><p>In the next second, all the corners, the ground, the pillars, and the furnishings in the hall creaked loudly and blue-white ice crystals formed everywhere.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s eyes narrowed as she held on to the Cang Godhood Sword.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>“Wait, don’t speak first.”</p><p>With a swish, Elder Han held up his hand and stopped Rao Yaoyao from speaking.</p><p>He didn’t seem to have any intention to attack for the time being. He appeared to be hatching up something. Then, he bent down and laughed.</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>He laughed till tears filled his eyes, then he quickly wiped them away. He looked up and roared.</p><p>“Hahaha, d*med Yan Wuse, d*mned Yu Kunpeng! Now that I’m back, your good days are numbered!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. What was going on? He stopped Rao Yaoyao just to say this?</p><p>If you really wanted to shout, shouldn’t you have shouted right after you made your debut? Or did you forget?</p><p>Also, the two people he talked about…Who were they?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never heard of these two names.</p><p>However, he quickly noticed that both Rao Yaoyao and Ye Xiao’s expressions turned serious, as if they had heard an extremely somber message from this sentence.</p><p>“It should be Elder Han’s enemy, and most likely an expert from the Holy Divine Palace? The two that threw Elder Han into the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes?” Xu Xiaoshou silently committed these two names to his memory.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s expression quickly returned to normal. She flipped the Cang Godhood Sword and displayed a serious stance.</p><p>“You.”</p><p>“Hold on.”</p><p>With a whoosh, Elder Han’s hand that had been lowered reached out once more, and stopped Rao Yaoyao from speaking.</p><p>He sized up the woman who held the sword in front of him, then glanced at Ye Xiao on the Necromancer’s shoulder, and finally at Chen Tan, who hid in a corner.</p><p>“They are all dressed…”</p><p>After he mumbled to himself, Elder Han laughed, flexed his legs and cupped his fists at the people in front of him.</p><p>“I’m sorry if I was rude.”</p><p>He then looked at Chen Tan and in an unfriendly tone said, “Brat, give me a set of clothes to wear.”</p><p>You’re crazy!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned as he took out his clothes and threw them over.</p><p>He recalled what Elder Han had said earlier. This guy had actually said that he was very similar to him and that they were the same kind of people.</p><p>Since when was he like this person?</p><p>This kind of extremely preposterous, completely absurd guy who couldn’t figure out the main point of the ‘war’ was not like him at all!</p><p>Elder Han nonchalantly put on his clothes under the gazes of three pairs of eyes. Then, he used an ice blade to cut off his underclothes and sleeves. After he felt less uncomfortable, he smiled and said.</p><p>“That’s enough. I’ll give you three chances to ask questions as an expression of my gratitude.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
