He stood up from the tea table and walked to the wooden door.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Kong Yuhen did not try to stop his departure in any way. It was as if he watched a friend leave, with a trace of longing and reluctance hidden within the depths of his eyes.</p><p>Other than that, he did not show any traces of hostility either.</p><p>The Holy Emperor Dragon Scale did not display any signs. His heart rate was normal.</p><p>Back then, due to the weird combination of the time and space attributes, Xu Xiaoshou who could not put up any resistance at all, did not believe in the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale. He felt that ordinarily the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale could be used in common situations, but not around Kong Yuhen.</p><p>If Jiang Buyi were to appear here, he might also be confused and be killed by the combination of the space-time attributes!</p><p>However, from the start till the end, it really seemed like he was just here to make friends. He took the initiative to lure people into this dilapidated place so he could cultivate a friendship with someone and talk about everything in the world.</p><p>“I must be crazy!”</p><p>The moment before Xu Xiaoshou’s hand pressed on the wooden door, he felt he was being irrational as he chose to absolve this guy of unknown origin in the depths of his heart.</p><p>He regained a trace of reason and stopped his thoughts, then pushed the wooden door open. He turned around and asked, “What’s behind this door?”</p><p>Kong Yuhen could not help but laugh. “Friend, you’re really anxious. Do you think there is hell behind the door?”</p><p>“+(Startled, Passive Points,+)+1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed drily. If he was doomed, then so be it. He was about to press his hand on the door and open it.</p><p>“Wait,” A voice came from behind.</p><p>“+(Startled, Passive Points,+)+1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself that what he dreaded most was about to take place!</p><p>He turned around slowly and saw Kong Yuhen walking back. He had taken down the staff that contained the power of time that hung on the far right side of the wooden wall opposite the wooden door,.</p><p>Then, he brought the staff to him.</p><p>“What do you mean by this?” Xu Xiaoshou was on high alert. He looked at the staff as if it were a nuclear bomb that could explode at any time.</p><p>“This is the ‘Time Ancestor Shadow Staff’. You probably haven’t heard of it before, but a long time ago, some busybodies listed it as one of the top ten Great Psionic Weapons.” Kong Yuhen explained.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils contracted.</p><p>Ancestor Shadow…</p><p>The top ten Great Psionic Weapons…</p><p>It turned out that this was not a mere nuclear bomb…</p><p>“What do you mean?” Xu Xiaoshou asked again in an extremely low voice. He felt as if his entire body was being controlled, similar to when he first came in, and his back was covered in cold sweat.</p><p>He tried to move his fingers…</p><p>Eh?</p><p>They could actually move?</p><p>“This is for you, a parting gift between friends.” Kong Yuhen, who resembled a rich scholar, handed over the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff.</p><p>“+(Startled, Passive Points,+)+1.”</p><p>“For me?” Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth fell open and his face turned pale. “Any strings attached…What’s the price?”</p><p>Kong Yuhen was stunned for a moment before he laughed heartily. “Friend, you’re really anxious! Couldn’t it be a gift without a price attached to it? If a ‘gift’ required a price, then what is a transaction?”</p><p>But I can’t believe it at all. Someone just gifted me one of the top ten Great Psionic Weapons, the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff, for no reason. What’s the difference between this and if an alien ran over and gifted me an Imitator?</p><p>Who would believe that?</p><p>“Just tell me.” Xu Xiaoshou said after he inhaled deeply. “I don’t believe you.”</p><p>Perhaps this was a tracker…</p><p>Maybe one day, when I’m on the verge of death, the thing inside will come out and take over my possessions…</p><p>Perhaps with the help of this Time Ancestor Shadow Staff, you will devour me, one step at a step in the days to come…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already found countless reasons for Kong Yuhen’s action in his mind, but none of them were labeled as ‘gifts’. This didn’t quite fit his definition of a big Boss in this world.</p><p>There was no such selfless person.</p><p>He looked like a rich fool.</p><p>Kong Yuhen didn’t know what Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts were, but he nodded in satisfaction. “Friend, this is the only time you’ve been so honest during your time in the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion. I can see it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face froze and his thoughts stopped.</p><p>However, the next second, Kong Yuhen’s expression changed. “Perhaps from your perspective, I should change the concept of ‘gift’ and put it in another way?”</p><p>His expression became cold and fierce, like a ruler who looked down on all the common people. He stuffed the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff into Xu Xiaoshou’s hands and said, “You don’t seem to have the ability to refuse or resist the things I want to give you in this All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned, and he nodded dazedly.</p><p>“Since that’s the case, I can only accept it, so why would I decline it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff in his hands. He felt that he was affected by time and space again, and he could not collect his thoughts.</p><p>“Alright, you can go now. I look forward to your second visit. Kong Yuhen’s warm smile was back on his face. “I’m sure you’ll be able to release some of your anxieties and communicate with me calmly.”</p><p>The wooden door was pushed open with a creak.</p><p>Outside the door was a dark mist and an Intangible space-time tunnel.</p><p>Kong Yuhen gestured with his hand. “Alright, you can go now. Don’t worry, there’s no need to be anxious. There’s no Hell ahead.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
