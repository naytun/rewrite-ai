This was the first time she had seen someone send Xu Xiaoshou flying with a single punch. However, since this was a giant, it seemed understandable.</p><p>In this world, other than giants, no one seemed to be able to accomplish such a magnificent feat.</p><p>“Is it really okay?” Xiao Kongtong was slightly worried. He already found it ridiculous that Xu Xiaoshou could survive that attack with a human body against a void servant without using his spiritual source or sword techniques.</p><p>Mei Siren shook his head slightly. He had no intention to stop Xu Xiaoshou’s actions.</p><p>He could see that although Xu Xiaoshou looked crazy, he still had his own plans. Just like when he was cultivating the Heart Sword Technique, he was trying to verify his own ideas.</p><p>What Xu Xiaoshou was thinking about, outsiders would definitely not know.</p><p>“Don’t worry about him. His sacred physique is incredibly special and his life force is extremely tenacious.” Mei Siren said softly.</p><p>“Sacred physique?” Mu Zixi glanced at her senior brother and thought to herself, how could Xu Xiaoshou have a sacred physique? His body was trained into such a state, by himself, through step-by-step cultivation.</p><p>“Cough, cough, cough…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had slid down from the labyrinth’s wall, coughed twice and spat out a few mouthfuls of blood. He looked at his body, which had been severely injured.</p><p>If it was an ordinary person, even if he was an expert at the higher void stage, he would not be able to recover from such a serious injury without at least three months or without any Holy Medicine or high-grade elixirs to repair the body.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou only took a few breaths, and without even taking an elixir, his condition recovered to a perfect state.</p><p>“As expected. It’s barely enough…”</p><p>“Are all void attendants demi-saints?”</p><p>“Speaking of which, how does one estimate their physical body strength when they reach the demi-saint stage? Would the body also give birth to Holy Power, or would it become a sacred physique that has completely released all its powers?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stood up and did not retreat. He met the void servant’s scarlet eyes, and illusory scales appeared on his body.</p><p>“Groar!”</p><p>An inhuman dragon’s roar came out of his throat. The next second, he was full of fighting spirit and rushed forward again.</p><p>“Come on, who’s afraid of who? Just do it!”</p><p>Feared. Passive Points +3.</p><p>The three people outside the arena looked in shock at Xu Xiaoshou, who had charged back as if nothing had happened. They had seen people who were not afraid of death, but it was rare to see someone who was so cruel to himself. Why did he go back to get himself beaten?</p><p>Moreover, why did they have a feeling that Xu Xiaoshou’s physical aura was comparable to the void servant’s?</p><p>“He recovered so quickly?” Xiao Kongtong was puzzled.</p><p>“I told you. His physique is special…” Mei Siren was equally confused, but he responded calmly as if he knew everything about his student.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>This was the first time the void servant had seen a human that did not turn into a pulp of flesh by its single punch. Immediately, its fighting spirit was ignited and it threw another punch.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t back down and met the attack with a punch, wearing the scales of the Dragon Ancestors that he had brought with him after consuming the Dragon Apricot.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>Within the labyrinth’s walls, there was another explosion, and the echo of the impact was endless.</p><p>The turbulent waves were like tides, each higher than the last, pushing away the people behind.</p><p>This time, the void servant took half a step back, and Xu Xiaoshou, who was thrown far away, did not hit the wall. His feet held onto the void tightly, and he slid and knelt for a few hundred feet before barely stopping.</p><p>Blood flowed out continuously, but Xu Xiaoshou was still a few feet away from the wall behind him!</p><p>“He has become stronger?” Xiao Kongtong was shocked. What happened? Xu Xiaoshou could already exchange fists with the void servant? Was that some kind of forbidden technique or secret technique?</p><p>“It doesn’t seem damaged.” Mei Siren squinted his eyes and observed for a while. He determined that Xu Xiaoshou was not using a cultivation method that would damage his own Dao Foundation, but something similar to a ” spiritual technique” that could strengthen his physical strength.</p><p>“The Dragon Apricot is so strong?” Mu Zixi was the only person who knew the internal affairs. However, she had not eaten her Dragon Apricot yet, because when she was about to eat, Xu Xiaoshou was in need of someone to record it.</p><p>Mu Zixi had never expected that the Holy Medicine, Dragon Apricot, would be able to increase one’s physical strength to such an extent.</p><p>If it was given to Xu Xiaoshou to consume, it would be like adding wings to a tiger!</p><p>And now, it was only one… If he took 99 of them in a row, wouldn’t he be tearing the void servant apart with his bare hands?</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had been sliding down to his knees in mid-air, stood up, his eyes shining.</p><p>He had only wanted to vent his anger and test out his new physical strength after his breakthrough. He had not expected that he would be able to resist the void servant.</p><p>One had to know that even Double Dumba*s had turned into meat paste and died after facing a kick from the void servant!</p><p>“Since I can fight it… Does that mean that if I use more tricks, I can defeat it now?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind began to work. With this thought, golden light spots bloomed around his body. Then, he raised his fist and rushed forward at full speed.</p><p>Exploding Posture!</p><p>“Roar…”</p><p>Such a tenacious human ant had really opened the eyes of the void servant. However, as a member of the void giant race, how could the void servant retreat?</p><p>It met Xu Xiaoshou with another punch!</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>Yet another wave of shock.</p><p>This time, when the two fists met, the golden light spots exploded, and the void servant was knocked back more than seven steps.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had activated the dragon ancestor’s scale pattern with the ‘exploding posture’, only slid back a few dozen feet in the air before he suddenly stopped.</p><p>He looked up again, and the bloodstains all over his body ignited his fighting spirit to the extreme.</p><p>“So, this is all you’ve got?”</p><p>With just one dragon apricot and the buffs from his various passive skills, he could already fight against the void servant in his human form.</p><p>If he was to add in other means…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
