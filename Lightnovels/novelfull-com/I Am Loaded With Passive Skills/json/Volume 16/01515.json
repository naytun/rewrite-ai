Her curvaceous figure had also reverted to the small flat figure during Mu Zixi’s time… uh, small body.</p><p>“It can’t be?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held his head in shock.</p><p>If he had not seen his Little Junior Sister’s growth progress…</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that he himself had the Transformation ability…</p><p>At this moment, he simply couldn’t believe that the human body could really undergo such a great change without being aware of it!</p><p>The living, cold, and seductive Lei Xi’er had really reverted to her former appearance as a little ‘loli’ after a ridiculous and inexplicable fight!</p><p>“The Flower of Life was the cause of it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had caught a blind spot.</p><p>Little Junior Sister had a Life-devouring Wood Physique… No, the Ultimate Life Demon Physique!</p><p>Usually, because when one absorbed too much Life force, one’s body would continue to stay young, and one could not maintain a normal growth.</p><p>During Lei Xi’er’s time, the large amount of Life force she had absorbed in the past had been scattered in an abnormal way and thus, she had ‘returned’ as a different person.</p><p>According to what Lei Xi’er had said at that time, under normal circumstances, Little Junior Sister should look like Lei Xi’ er… well, in her appearance.</p><p>So, the current situation happened because the Holy Medicine, the ‘Flower of Life’ he had given her contained too much Life force?</p><p>Not only did he heal Little Junior Sister’s injuries, but he also forced the excessive Life force back into Lei Xi’er’s body and released a young version of Lei Xi’er, that was Mu Zixi?</p><p>“I was just fooling around!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt that everything was ridiculous.</p><p>Was this how the Ultimate Life Demon Physique was used?</p><p>Why did it feel like everything had gone off course?</p><p>This was clearly an ordinary test, so why did he suddenly cause his opponent to shrink?</p><p>“However, her last move, ‘Scourge from Heaven, Dao-breaking heart, was indeed very powerful.”</p><p>“If I didn’t have the ‘Freeze’ ability, I really might have died here… Why did she suddenly hit me so hard? Was she so certain that I’m immune to all sorts of mental damage?”</p><p>“Well, indeed I thought so and said so too. It’s my fault, it’s indeed my fault… It’s just that it was really hard to control the intensity of the battle.”</p><p>“This was a lesson. In the future, I must find Master Siren to test my moves. I can’t mess around with her anymore!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned and pondered.</p><p>This fight had simply gone too far!</p><p>The only mistake he made was that even he himself didn’t expect that after the ‘Freeze’ ability’s defense was broken, it brought the same rebound damage to the caster.</p><p>It was normal for Lei Xi’er to be overwhelmed.</p><p>However. judging from the fact that the Scourge from Heaven, Dao-breaking Heart move had shattered the ‘Freeze’ ability’s defense…</p><p>Under the Demi-Saint realm, as long as one didn’t have an extraordinary defense like the ‘Freeze’ ability, it would be very difficult for anyone to resist Lei Xi’er, who was only at the Sovereign Dao Realm but had mastered the power of the God Devil Eyes.</p><p>“She’s actually this strong?”</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou thought about it, he couldn’t help but pinch the face of his Junior Sister in his arms.</p><p>This face had reverted to its familiar appearance, and the feeling was also the same. He didn’t know if it would be Lei Xi’er’s will or Mu Zixi’s will that would take control when she woke up.</p><p>Ultimate Life Demon Physique…</p><p>He then glanced at the transformation in his Junior Sister’s body as she laid in his arms. Xu Xiaoshou still felt that it was incredible.</p><p>“During the battle, when she was on the verge of death, she changed from Mu Zixi who had no combat strength to Lei Xi’er. Now that she was attacked by the ‘Freeze’ ability, she could transform again from Lei Xi’er.”</p><p>“In other words, the true strength of the Ultimate Life Demon Physique is that if the ‘one will’ of the ‘two wills’ had not been destroyed at the same time, it would basically be impossible for Little Junior Sister to die?”</p><p>“From the point of the tenacious Life force, the Ultimate Life Demon Physique is indeed terrifying. It’s impossible to guard against it!”</p><p>“Also, the Lei Family’s Eyes…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of the Scourge from Heaven Dao-breaking heart tribulation that had perfectly fused with the Holy Power. It was not difficult to see that this was the” power of punishment – that belonged to the Lei family in the past – the power of the Heavenly Tribulation!</p><p>He suddenly understood why the Lei family had been destroyed.</p><p>She was able to do this with just a pair of God Devil Eyes and even break through the defense of the ‘Freeze’ ability.</p><p>Therefore, a family who only had a Spiritual Cultivator at the Higher Void State, even if he was a match for a Demi-Saint, this Spiritual Cultivator, as long he was in the Sovereign Dao Realm would be able to defeat the higher void level, and even with the Demi-Saint’s Power, if it could not be destroyed, then who could destroy it?</p><p>However, ‘the common man is innocent, but he is guilty for having kept a treasure’ was only a description. It could not be a reason or an excuse for people to cover up their own greed.</p><p>“It’s so difficult…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed silently and abandoned all thoughts about his Junior Sister’s background and landed under the Spirit Mark of Life with the girl in his arms. He let the power of the Holy Medicine and the Spirit Mark of Life nourish his Junior Sister’s body and looked forward to her return.</p><p>This wait lasted for more than half a day.</p><p>The Spirit Herbs and Holy Medicine in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer swayed in the breeze.</p><p>At the hundred thousand Alchemy Cauldron, Greedy the Cat Spirit secretly swallowed and spat out the Dragon Apricot while it pretended to be conducting alchemy. However, its eyes were always on its male and female owners.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind was blank, and he was unaware of the thoughts that went through his mind for most of the day.</p><p>Finally…</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>When the person in his arms stirred and moaned, Xu Xiaoshou was jolted out of his reverie.</p><p>“Little Junior Sister?”</p><p>He patted her face and realized that there was no response. He put her on his lap again, pinched her cheeks with both hands, and pulled her up.</p><p>“You’re awake?”</p><p>The Flower of Life was a Holy Medicine, and it was infused with the Qi from the Spirit Mark of Life.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
