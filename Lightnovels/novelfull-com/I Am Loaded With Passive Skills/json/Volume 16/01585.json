(1)</p><p>“+(Suspected, Passive Points+) +1.”</p><p>“+(Affected, Passive Points),+1.”</p><p>“+(Stared At, Passive Points,+)+1.”</p><p>“+(Conjecture, Passive Points,+)+1.”</p><p>“..”</p><p>The Information Bar was filled with pop-up boxes.</p><p>Since he wasn’t under the control of the Three Loathsome Eyes, the frequency of the notifications reached a new peak.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had rarely seen someone who was so suspicious.</p><p>The first few times he had experienced a situation like this was when he used all sorts of disguises to deceive the Night Guardian.</p><p>At that time, Night Guardian had been very suspicious, but was restricted by various means to make any moves, so he could only offer passive points in vain.</p><p>On this point, even Rao Yaoyao had to admit defeat.</p><p>And now, Xu Xiaoshou knew that there was one more person with the same traits.</p><p>Ever since he had encountered the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, this guy had contributed Passive Points to him, and now there were even more.</p><p>No one had ever thought that under under the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s seemingly calm appearance, there was such a suspicious soul inside.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know why he was so suspicious.</p><p>Could it be that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had met Chen Ruye from the Xu Yue Grey Palace before?</p><p>When the last mocking voice rang out, which indicated that he was out of control, Xu Xiaoshou knew that this suspicious soul was probably up to something.</p><p>This situation was very familiar.</p><p>When Night Guardian couldn’t hold it in anymore, he would often choose to take action by force, even if he didn’t have orders from his superior, such as that time on the Lone Cliff.</p><p>It wasn’t just Night Guardian; suspicious people were always like this.</p><p>“You’re actually not hypnotized?” The voice of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man sounded.</p><p>His voice was filled with shock and confusion, as if he didn’t expect that there was a person under the Demi-Saint level who could still have self-awareness after he looked at the Three Loathsome Eyes.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t see this.</p><p>He saw the Five Decays of Heaven and Man soar into the sky and strike out with his palm as he spoke.</p><p>It was a withered palm. It was extremely thin, but it was wrapped in a strange gray-black airflow. It looked extremely slow, but it was actually so fast that it left an afterimage. It directly broke through the space and blasted toward his chest.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was prepared.</p><p>He made his move almost at the same time. His body emitted endless streams of evil Violet Qi. He kicked Gu Qinger and sent him flying. He took out the Cursed Yin Eye that was the size of a human head and flung it at the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>“Swish…”</p><p>Clouds of violet and gray Qi bloomed at the same time.</p><p>The moment he raised his palm, Xu Xiaoshou felt that something was wrong.</p><p>Even if it was a small detail, this was his body. Xu Xiaoshou knew where the problem was.</p><p>His movements had slowed down…</p><p>It was only a trace, but it shouldn’t be!</p><p>Was it because of the effect of the Ultimate Attribute, or…</p><p>He didn’t have time to think about it, and even an stranger incident happened.</p><p>The moment before the two palms collided, the surrounding air was compressed and exploded, and even the space became distorted.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clearly saw the skinny hand of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man smash the surrounding space, which could only be shattered by his own Sovereign Stage body. His pupils shrank.</p><p>The Cursed Yin Eye remained in place and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was on his guard against it.</p><p>He used his palm, which was wrapped in a grayish-black air current, to smash the Cursed Yin Eye. His eyes were so calm that it was as if the person in front of him was already a corpse.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>There was a loud explosive sound.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou finally realized what was wrong.</p><p>In an instant, he used 120% of his strength, which he had only used because of his status. He even gritted his teeth so hard that they were about to break.</p><p>However, he still felt that what he faced was not an old man with one foot in the grave, but a Void Attendant in human skin…No, a Void General!</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou spat out a mouthful of blood, and his body was sent flying like a cannonball. The sleeve on his right arm was shredded to pieces along with the flesh.</p><p>A second ago, he was still in the middle of the void passage. The next second, when he regained consciousness, he was embedded into the corner wall at the end of the passage and his whole body trembled.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded.</p><p>He was stunned as he looked at the muscles that writhed and regrew on his broken arm.</p><p>He swore that this was the first person who had been able to beat him in terms of physical strength since he had embarked on the path of Spiritual Cultivation. Elder Sang and the Void Attendant were not considered as humans.</p><p>At the same time, after the gray-black energy that contained the aura of decay invaded his system, he also noticed the abnormalities that appeared in various parts of his body.</p><p>Weak…</p><p>It was a weakness that was visible to the naked eye!</p><p>Even with a passive skill like the Eternal Vitality, his Life force was being drained at a rate that did not match the Ultimate Attribute of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>The inconspicuous ‘affected’ caught Xu Xiaoshou’s attention, which was sandwiched between ‘suspicion’ and ‘speculation’ in the Information Bar from the beginning to the end.</p><p>From the first time they met until now, it had never stopped?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his blood run cold.</p><p>“Who was this Five Decays of Heaven and Man?”</p><p>On the other side, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was obviously not in a good state too.</p><p>Similarly, he had also realized that something was wrong the moment their palms met, and he had increased his strength from 10% to his full strength.</p><p>With the support of the physical strength of more than a dozen Void Attendants that he had swallowed, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was also blown away by the palm strike of the young man opposite him. He slid in an arc across the sky and smashed into the wall on the other side.</p><p>The Cursed Yin Eye had been embedded in his palm and almost destroyed it.</p><p>The strange evil energy invaded his body in a frenzy, but it quietly disappeared under the core of the darkness, swallowed up like the Void Attendant.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
