Mei Siren, Xiao Kongtong and Mu Zixi turned their heads in surprise.</p><p>“Are you alright?” The little girl ran over quickly. Her subconscious action was not to help, but to take out the image recording bead, but she resisted the urge.</p><p>This was too funny.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou actually fell in?</p><p>Even she could walk out of the spatial passageway steadily. Had Xu Xiaoshou’s spatial comprehension gone to the dogs?</p><p>“I’m fine…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stood up with his hand placed on his forehead and seemed to be in a daze.</p><p>The first question he asked after he came back to his senses was addressed to Master Siren who was not the type to make a joke. “Teacher, how long have you been here?”</p><p>“I just entered.” Mei Siren’s expression changed slightly. “On your body, not only were there traces of you having passed through space, but also the smell of time. What did you encounter?”</p><p>Time?</p><p>Xiao Kongtong felt slightly dazed. He sensed carefully and found that what Master Siren said was true.</p><p>It was as if Xu Xaoshou had entered a space-time tunnel instead of a spatial passageway like everyone else.</p><p>Those who had practiced the Fantasy Sword Technique and the Nine Swords Technique would definitely understand the two major elements of time and space.</p><p>The marks on Xu Xiaoshou’s body were not very obvious, but if one paid close attention, they could see some traces of it.</p><p>“Smell?”</p><p>On the other side, Mu Zixi was also stunned. She wrinkled her nose and sniffed a few times, and a suspicious look appeared on her face.</p><p>Did time really have a taste?</p><p>What kind of noses did they have…</p><p>“I just entered. This means that the time I fell was when I was together with the Teachers. There had been no time lapse in between.”</p><p>“And I clearly stayed for quite some time in the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion.”.</p><p>“The time…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head to clear the fog in his brain. He felt that everything that had happened just now was so unreal.</p><p>It was like waking up from a dream in grandeur, and in the eyes of outsiders, nothing had changed?</p><p>“What is that?”</p><p>Suddenly, Mu Zixi pointed at the staff in Xu Xiaoshou’s hand and asked.</p><p>Perhaps in the eyes of Mei Siren and Xiao Kongtong, it was normal for Xu Xiaoshou to have a treasure to protect himself after he entered an unfamiliar place.</p><p>However, Mu Zixi was sure that Xu Xiaoshou did not have this staff before.</p><p>Even in the Yuan Mansion, she had never seen this staff nor any trace of its unique aura.</p><p>It was a very powerful aura!</p><p>When they heard her question, Mei Siren and Xiao Kongtong looked over. In the next second, they both realized that the ‘time aura’ on Xu Xaoshou’s body was from this staff.</p><p>“A Time Attribute treasure?” Xiao Kongtong was a little surprised. After all, this was a rare sight.</p><p>“Have you all heard of the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff?” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t attempt to hide anything. He held up the staff and told them frankly. These people with him were his own people, so he did not have to be vague about it.</p><p>As soon as he finished his narration, both Mei Siren and Xiao Kongtong’s pupils contracted.</p><p>“I’ve heard of it.” Mu Zixi also nodded vehemently.</p><p>“You’ve heard of it?” Xu Xiaoshou was surprised. It was normal for Teacher and the Eldest Senior Brother to know about it, but even little Junior Sister knew about it.</p><p>“What have you heard about it?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“The name.” Mu Zixi blinked. “The Time Ancestor Shadow Staff. You just mentioned it just now.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a long while before he realized that his Little Junior Sister was playing tricks on him. This silly girl clearly didn’t know anything!</p><p>“You…”</p><p>He ruthlessly struck out at his Junior Sister’s head, but the latter dodged his blow with a giggle.</p><p>Fooled you, Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>I learned this from you!</p><p>“+(Played, Passive Points)+1.”</p><p>“Let me take a look.” Mei Siren stretched out his hand.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou handed it over without any second thoughts.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the staff was a real object in his hand. However, when he was about to pass it to Master Siren, it turned into an illusion and passed through the old Sword Deity’s hand.</p><p>As if the time and space had been messed up, the staff that should have fallen to the ground returned to Xu Xiaoshou’s hands, just like how Xu Xiaoshou had held the staff when he had first fallen.</p><p>This scene shocked Xu Xiaoshou, as if he was being targeted by some kind of curse. At the same time, Mei Siren and Xiao Kongtong’s expressions turned grave.</p><p>“What happened to you?”</p><p>“You’ve met Kong Yuhen?”</p><p>There were two questions thrown at him at the same time. The first one was from Xiao Kongtong and the second one was from Mei Siren.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have met his savior. Both he and Xiao Kongtong looked at Master Siren in surprise.</p><p>“Kong Yuhen?” Xiao Kongtong was in a state of disbelief.</p><p>“Teacher, you know him?” Xu Xiaoshou grabbed the Time Ancestor Shadow staff and only realized now what it meant to have an ‘old man’ at home; it was like he had a treasure.</p><p>“Who is he…you mean, Kong Yuhen from the Ten High Nobles?” Mu Zixi couldn’t react for a moment, but her eyes lit up after she thought about it.</p><p>Mei Siren’s eyes left the illusory staff in his student’s arms and swept over the three curious friends. He then said solemnly.</p><p>“This Time Ancestor Shadow Staff has been lost for a long time. The last time it appeared was during the War of the Ten High Nobles and it was brought by Kong Yuhen.”</p><p>“But after that battle, everything about him seemed to have been erased. Many people had forgotten about him.”</p><p>“I remember, because there were many geniuses among this generation’s Ten High Nobles.”</p><p>“I have been paying close attention to Bazhun’an and that is why I know a little about the Ten High Nobles, including Kui Leihan and the mysterious Kong Yuhen.”</p><p>“The reason why I guessed that you’ve met Kong Yuhen was also because of this deduction. There’s no way anyone in the world can snatch the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff from Kong Yuhen’s hands. The only possibility is that you’ve met him and he…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
