However, the words left behind were all ancient characters that could be traced back to the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>“Have you heard of the ‘Hall of No Pardon’?” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t turn his head as he said this. He walked inside; it was obvious he did not expect any answer from the mute.</p><p>“Your cultivation level is very weak.” At this moment, a deep and hoarse voice came from behind. The voice sounded very strange, neither male nor female; it was neutral, which was extremely inconsistent with her beautiful appearance.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stopped in his tracks, turned around, and laughed. “That’s right. My Spiritual Cultivation has yet to bear fruit, but that’s not my main cultivation. I have other abilities.”</p><p>“Why did you come here?” The black-feathered woman asked him calmly.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou was observing the surroundings, he had already thought about the questions the woman would ask once she spoke.</p><p>It’s just that you’re so weak, how dare you enter the First Hall of Sins? Why would he enter the Abyss Island? What do you want to do here? What was his goal? Is Chen Tan your real name? You look a lot like Xu Xiaoshou. After all, Xu Xiaoshou was the only one in the world who was so weak and so fat… And so on and so forth.</p><p>He had at least thirteen solutions to the questions.</p><p>“I’m from the Southern Region, and I’m the sole heir of the sixteenth generation of the Qingjing school.. I majored in the art of magic, but I like swordsmanship. I once sought a sword from the famous Feng family for a period of time, and I’ve made some small achievements. At least I can protect myself in this rundown place…” Xu Xiaoshou revealed the identity information that he had fabricated in his heart when he changed his appearance just now.</p><p>However, he knew when to stop. After a pause, he threw the question back with a smile, as if his original intention was to exchange information, which was why he talked so much.</p><p>“What about you, young lady? I’ve said so much, but why don’t you talk about yourself? What are you doing here?”</p><p>The black-feathered woman still did not reply.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a little bored.</p><p>As expected, this woman was reticent by nature. He turned around and wanted to continue to explore this ‘Hall of No Pardon’.</p><p>Suddenly, everything around him seemed to darken. Xu Xiaoshou’s heart thumped heavily, and a pop-up appeared in the Information Bar.</p><p>“+(Ambushed, Passive Points+)+1.”</p><p>“Land of Dark Night!”</p><p>With a low groan, darkness surged through the surrounding environment like a tide.</p><p>The Great Hall was filled with endless chill. Spooky ghosts emerged from the black soil and bared their fangs and brandished their claws. Some clung to the pillars of the Hall, some drifted about in the void, but most of them rushed towards Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“I knew that a battle was inevitable, wouldn’t it have been better if I had come earlier?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sneered. He turned around as if he had been prepared for this. He tapped his foot and the dark small sword named ‘Ghost Inscription’ in his eyes lit up. It immediately saw through everything and passed through the ghosts without even touching a single one. At the same time, he raised a finger to his chest and formed a seal with one hand.</p><p>As he dodged the attacks, his body shifted in mid-air, and as his black hair fluttered, his spiritual source surged forth.</p><p>In the next second, an evil-looking streak of purple light suddenly shone on the Land of Dark Night, and a mysterious looking pupil appeared on Xu Xiaoshou’s head.</p><p>The pupil glowed with purple light, like the sun and shone on all the ghosts.</p><p>“Cursed Yin Eye’, demonic transformation!”</p><p>“Wu…wu…wu…Screams of pain echoed in the gloomy darkness. Each of them held their heads and retreated. They seemed to have been attacked by the spiritual pollution and had completely lost sight of their target.</p><p>“Phantom Swords Technique and Ghost Inscription, Evil Technique of the Southern Region… Chen Tan… The black-feathered woman’s red lips were half-opened as if she was mumbling to herself. Then, the spiritual source around her body converged, and the power of the Land of Dark Night returned to her body.</p><p>The darkness came and went quickly, like the ebbing waters after the high tide and disappeared.</p><p>The dark-feathered woman took a step forward. She no longer seemed to have any doubts and took the initiative to say, “I’m Ye Xiao.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
