He cupped his fists and said solemnly.</p><p>“I came to Zhen Huang Palace to look for one thing. It’s called the ‘exemption order’. If I can exchange it for something, if not, I’ll take my leave.”</p><p>He clearly stated that he would not disturb or even break the silence of this place, as well as the thoughts of the sleeping giant statue. He also would not destroy it and only came in peace.</p><p>The giant statue took its time to respond.</p><p>After a long while, a white light appeared in front of it.</p><p>It was a light cluster that was surrounded by white Holy Power and inside it was an object that was in the form of a command token.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was overjoyed when he saw this. He stepped forward and said, “Can I have it?”</p><p>Exemption order!</p><p>This was definitely the exemption order!</p><p>This seemed to be the reason why Zhen Huang Palace was different from the other ‘halls’ he had encountered before and had the tag ‘Palace’. It was the main palace in the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>The thing that he needed was here.</p><p>He had come to the right place!</p><p>After a long pause, the giant statue replied mechanically, “Exemption order… Fifty… Void Crystals…”</p><p>Jiang Buyi was rooted to the spot. The burning fire of enthusiasm in his heart seemed to have been doused by cold water.</p><p>50 Void Crystals?</p><p>What was a Void Crystal?</p><p>Wait, didn’t the Five Decays Of Heaven and Man mention this before?</p><p>When he killed the Void Attendants, he found some special hexagonal crystals on their bodies…</p><p>That thing was the Void Crystal?</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s face turned green.</p><p>Along the way, he had followed the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. Since he had not done anything, he naturally did not obtain any Void Crystals.</p><p>Of course, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man wouldn’t be so kind as to give a part of the spoils of war to him.</p><p>Whenever they encountered a Void Attendant, they would avoid it as if they were avoiding a fierce tiger. They would choose to take a detour for fear that the battle would attract more unknown disasters.</p><p>Thus, Jiang Buyi did not have a single Void Crystal!</p><p>“Can you…” Jiang Buyi hesitated for a while. His face was slightly red as he asked softly, “Can I owe you first? ”</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>Suddenly, he heard a muffled sound beside him. It sounded like laughter.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was shocked. He quickly turned his head and saw that other than himself, the statue, and the Taboo Puppet, there was no fourth person in the great hall.</p><p>Then this muffled sound…</p><p>Jiang Buyi stared suspiciously at the Taboo Puppet.</p><p>Its face was pale and its limbs were stiff. It still had its head down and seemed to be muttering to itself.</p><p>Jiang Buyi walked over silently and the chanting in his ears disappeared.</p><p>He knew that this was the only incantation the Taboo Puppet could say. He didn’t know what it was used for, and he couldn’t make out the contents clearly.</p><p>It seemed to be something like ‘scrape’ and ‘hope’ and so on.</p><p>“Do you have any Void Crystals?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi squatted down and looked at the little girl who was as delicate as a doll. He asked softly, “It’s a kind of hexagonal crystal, black… It should look like this.”</p><p>He used the black cloud to simulate the Void Crystal that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had once collected. He was afraid that the Taboo Puppet would not recognize it, so he showed her its form.</p><p>Mu Zixi’s listless gaze swept across the black cloud and landed on Jiang Buyi’s face.</p><p>Of course, she recognized the Void Crystal. She had some with her!</p><p>However, could that be given out?</p><p>As long as she acted even slightly like a normal person or displayed the ability to communicate, what would follow would be endless probing and trouble.</p><p>Mu Zixi wasn’t stupid. She opened her mouth as if she wanted to say something.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s eyes gleamed with anticipation.</p><p>“Melon…”</p><p>In a flash, Jiang Buyi exited the hall, away from the Taboo Puppet.</p><p>If he stayed any longer, the power of the curse would fall on him.</p><p>As expected, it was impossible to successfully communicate with that thing!</p><p>“Is there any way? I will take your ‘exemption order’ now and give you some other items as a trade? I don’t have any Void Crystals.” Jiang Buyi threw the question to the giant statue that he could communicate with.</p><p>“Exemption order… Fifty… Void Crystals…”</p><p>The giant statue’s staccato voice sounded.. It was better than the Taboo Puppet and could at least communicate, but obviously not much.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was furious.</p><p>He thought about the possibility of ‘forcibly snatching’ the item.</p><p>At this moment, an ear-piercing scream suddenly came from the great hall.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>The Taboo Puppet’s body trembled and it looked up. Its face was pale, and its Holy Power flashed as if it was about to attack.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was frightened.</p><p>He wasn’t afraid of the scream, but was terrified of the reaction of the Taboo Puppet.</p><p>In a flash, Jiang Buyi appeared in front of the exquisite doll again. He held her down with both hands and spoke, “You don’t have to do anything. I’m here. Leave everything to me.”</p><p>Only then did the Taboo Puppet regain its calm, and its eyes became dazed again.</p><p>Jiang Buyi had enough of such a life of fear!</p><p>He swore that once he got the exemption order and was able to attack at will, the first thing he would kill would be this Taboo Puppet!</p><p>At that time, regardless of whatever Life force, world aura, or Holy Power fluctuations she had, he would take them all and deprive her of all her abilities.</p><p>If he couldn’t get them, he would take it out of the Abyss Island and bring it back to the Jiang Clan in Pu Xuan at the Northern Region to study it.</p><p>No matter how strong she was, could she be stronger than a Demi-Saint?</p><p>However, now, under the premise that his attacks were still limited, Jiang Buyi had to take the lead to stabilize the emotions of the Taboo Puppet in case of any danger.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
