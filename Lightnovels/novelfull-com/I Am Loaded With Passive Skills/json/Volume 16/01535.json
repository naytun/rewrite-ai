In a flash, he appeared at the far end of the labyrinth where Kong Yuhen was and threw a punch.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A punch, which had been strengthened by the Dragon Apricot, landed solidly on the maze’s wall that was so high that it was invisible.</p><p>The punch caused the wall to shake, but as the labyrinth’s walls wriggled, it seemed to have completely absorbed the attack. Xu Xiaoshou could not see any cracks.</p><p>The wall was undamaged!</p><p>“Kong Yuhen…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know what to think as he watched the figure disappear in front of him.</p><p>The conversation between him, Master Siren, Xiao Kongtong, and the others just now was all heard by this guy?</p><p>He had always been here, but it was as if he was in a second space. Even experts like Master Siren and Xiao Kongtong didn’t notice him?</p><p>Moreover, Xu Xiaoshou could see him. Was it because his inspiration was too strong, or… Did Kong Yuhen want only him to see?</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Almost at the same time, Mei Siren caught up and came to Xu Xiaoshou’s side. He looked at his own disciple, whose aura was fluctuating and whose expression was slightly tense. He looked around and asked in confusion.</p><p>“Who did you see?” Xiao Kongtong also came over, but his tone sounded as if he already had the answer.</p><p>Only Mu Zixi stepped forward and touched the labyrinth’s walls. She was shocked that the walls were so strong that they could actually withstand Xu Xiaoshou’s punch. At the same time, she looked at her senior brother worriedly. “Are you hallucinating?”</p><p>“Kong Yuhen.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou revealed his full name. He was not afraid of Kong Yuhen’s attention. Instead, he hoped that this guy would come out when Master Siren and Xiao Kongtong were present.</p><p>“I saw Kong Yuhen. He’s always been in this position, silently watching us.”</p><p>As soon as he said this, the three people beside him all felt their hearts palpitate. They only felt a sense of terror crawl all over their bodies. However, when they looked around again, they still did not notice anything.</p><p>“He’s gone.” Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and sighed. He grabbed the ancestral shadow staff and decided to let go of everything. “Forget it. Let’s not bother ourselves with him.”</p><p>Kong Yuhen was right. He was too anxious.</p><p>This guy didn’t have any hostility yet, so why should he go against him because of fear?</p><p>As long as he left the First Hall of Sins and found Bazhun’an, he believed that Kong Yuhen’s position would be clear.</p><p>If it didn’t…</p><p>Even if it didn’t, he shouldn’t be the one dealing with this guy. His opponent should be Bazhun’an. There was no reason for Kong Yuhen to only target him.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>As the few of them pondered, a roar sounded from the depths of the fog around the corner of the labyrinth.</p><p>This roar attracted the attention of the four present. Turning around, they saw a void servant, dark-skinned and scarlet-eyed, slowly walking over from the end of the tall wall.</p><p>“Ye Xiaotian said that the ultimate attribute of the First Hall of Sins has been activated. This must be the guardian of this place. He also said that there are many void servants here. I’m afraid there are definitely more than a few… ” Xiao Kongtong made a judgment.</p><p>Before the word “hundred” could come out of his mouth, he saw Xu Xiaoshou roar and raise his fist, like a mayfly trying to shake a tree, and rush straight at the tall void servant!</p><p>“What?” Xiao Kongtong was stunned. A human body compared to a void servant was like an ant to a giant.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…” Mu Zixi was also stunned. Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were red, and one could imagine how anxious he was.</p><p>“Is he alright?” The little girl couldn’t help but turn to look at the old Sword Deity, thinking that the only person here who could stop Xu Xiaoshou from seeking death was probably Master Siren.</p><p>“Let him vent his anger.” Mei Siren sighed, thinking of all the things that had happened to Xu Xiaoshou. “He’s too anxious, especially after he appeared.”</p><p>…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was very calm.</p><p>He just wanted to vent his strength all of a sudden.</p><p>When facing Kong Yuhen, the feeling of weakness and powerlessness was almost magnified to the maximum.</p><p>Even if he knew that anyone under the combination of time and space could feel the same way, even if he guessed that there was no hostility between them…</p><p>However, the feeling of not being able to control one’s own fate and leaving one’s life in the hands of an outsider was not a good feeling.</p><p>The sudden appearance of the void servant was a good outlet for him to vent his emotions.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he couldn’t defeat the void servant and is behaving like a moth flying into the fire, but he dared to be so impulsive because he had Mister Siren and Xiao Kongtong behind him.</p><p>A young man should be impulsive sometimes.</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>The red-eyed Xu Xiaoshou had no intention of using his spiritual source. He just wanted to have a head-on battle with the void servant using pure physical strength.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The void servant was also enraged.</p><p>In this hall, this ant-like person was the first one who didn’t turn around and run but chose to calmly face death when meeting it.</p><p>“I’ll grant you your wish!”</p><p>The black fist the size of a meteorite met the delicate attack of the human body. In this sudden physical battle, the first drum of the battle sounded.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>The explosion arrived, and the air billowed, twisting the space and pushing it all around the maze, causing the clothes and hair of the three people outside the battlefield to rustle.</p><p>With a whoosh, Xu Xiaoshou’s bloodied figure, who had been fighting the void servant, was sent flying in the next breath. He smashed into the labyrinth’s wall and slowly slid down.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
