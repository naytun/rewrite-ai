Tan!”</p><p>The black cold current arrived in an instant.</p><p>Elder Han’s laughter also became extremely presumptuous, as if the powerful body where all his power was stored would be easily available in the next second.</p><p>To be honest, none of the three present were the best choices.</p><p>If possible, Elder Han would have preferred an ice-type Spiritual Cultivator to be his puppet.</p><p>However, it was obvious that he had no other choice. Rao Yaoyao’s judgment was right. At the moment, Elder Han looked strong on the outside but was actually weak on the inside. He couldn’t unleash all of the power he had when he was at his peak.</p><p>Thus, in order to deal with Rao Yaoyao, he needed some support.</p><p>Of the three people present, Rao Yaoyao was out of the question. Other than that, the only candidates left to be the host bodies were Ye Xiao and Chen Tan.</p><p>In terms of ranking, Ye Xiao was actually ranked above Chen Tan.</p><p>Elder Han’s choice wasn’t very rational, because it was easy to tell which was stronger between the ‘Aura of the God of Death’ and the ‘Aura of the Ancestor’s Power’.</p><p>But in the end, he chose Chen Tan because this brat was of the same kind and gender. He also had a slightly familiar faint aura.</p><p>Of course, this choice was also mixed with the thought to exact a little bit of revenge.</p><p>Who asked Chen Tan to slander him just now?</p><p>In addition to these subjective and self satisfying thoughts, there was also the influence of objective factors.</p><p>Just now-in Chen Tan’s filthy remarks, these words appeared-the Third Ancestor of the White Vein!</p><p>“I’d like to see how much you know about the Third Ancestor of the White Vein!” Elder Han’s body turned into a black cold current that contained only his two black glowing eyes. He charged toward Chen Tan.</p><p>It’s here!</p><p>He’s already here!</p><p>Just as the black cold air was about to pierce through his nose and mouth, Xu Xiaoshou’s petrified body suddenly trembled, and a thought flashed through his mind.</p><p>“Acalanatha, release!”</p><p>He instantly turned off his Awakening skill, Acalanatha.</p><p>That’s right. He had used this skill the moment he realized that the situation wasn’t right. In the next second, the entire scene was controlled by Elder Han.</p><p>However, control was only control after all, not an attack.</p><p>Since Elder Han didn’t suffer any backlash, it meant that all his skills were immune to Xu Xiaoshou’s Acalanatha.</p><p>“How is that possible? How could this kid ignore my Holy Energy? Can’t be controlled?”</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>When he turned off his Acalanatha, Xu Xiaoshou could see the shock that flashed across the black cold eyes in front of him.</p><p>In the next second, his expression turned extremely ferocious and his body emitted a raging evil purple light. Then, with lightning speed, he grabbed a purple eyeball the size of a human head from his hand.</p><p>“Hand of great mercy!”</p><p>With a loud roar, Xu Xiaoshou slapped the Cursed Yin Eye onto the black cold current.</p><p>This strike was so powerful that a blinding golden light exploded when the two sides came into contact.</p><p>Exploding Posture!</p><p>How could Xu Xiaoshou allow Elder Han to get close?</p><p>This Ghost Beast of unknown origin was also a hypocrite who made up lies and had difficulties when it had to distinguish between the truth and the lies. Even if the will of many big Bosses had emerged in his body when he had faced the Demi-Saint Zang Ren, that was only because he had been passive.</p><p>If he allowed Elder Han to enter his body, not to mention whether those wills would reappear, it was something that Xu Xiaoshou could not accept.</p><p>I’m the master of my body.</p><p>In the past, I was weak and powerless.</p><p>Now that I have so many passive skills, I’m no longer an ant. How dare you, a mere Demi-Saint, covet my body?</p><p>BOOM! There was a loud explosion. The ‘Exploding Posture’ was indeed the ‘Recoil’ awakening technique. When it reached the Sovereign Stage, it had already shown adequate ferocity.</p><p>He didn’t even have time to react!</p><p>Logically speaking, the Ghost Beast’s Possession was a special attack that was slightly above the three stages of flesh, spirit, and will, and ordinary defensive means could not resist it at all.</p><p>However, Chen Tan was truly an evil cultivator from the Southern Region. He had actually mastered a method that could resist the Ghost Beast Possession!</p><p>That golden light…</p><p>Elder Han was already dumbfounded.</p><p>He didn’t even resist when he realized that something was wrong. He thought that Chen Tan’s attack would only pass through and not cause any real damage.</p><p>But the result was…</p><p>He flew out of the door of the Tian San cell, passed by Rao Yaoyao and Ye Xiao, and flew in front of Chen Tan. However, Chen Tan had slapped it so hard that it actually saw stars. It then streaked past the two of them and finally was embedded in the ice crystal Cave in the Tian San cell.</p><p>It was only then that Rao Yaoyao and Ye Xiao broke free from the Demi-Saint’s power.</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points +2.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao held her sword in the air before she froze and stared dazedly at Chen Tan.</p><p>Her original intention was to help Chen Tan, but this guy didn’t need any help at all. He resisted Elder Han’s Possession by himself!</p><p>So, what had happened just now?</p><p>A small evil cultivator from the Southern Region had sent a Demi-Saint Ghost Beast flying with a slap?</p><p>“You’re kidding me!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao subconsciously thought that this was a trick, a self-directed and self-played trick by Elder Han and Chen Tan.</p><p>How could a Demi-Saint be sent flying? This was impossible!</p><p>However, the next moment…</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>A hysterical roar came from the Tian San cell.</p><p>The frosty white mist there had been completely dyed with an evil purple color, and Elder Han clutched his chest and screamed in agony.</p><p>“The Power of the Evil God’s Aura…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao came to her senses. This was Chen Tan’s ability that Ye Xiao had told her about initially.</p><p>She suddenly realized that she had underestimated this sorcerer from the Southern Region. Not only she, but Ye Xiao and Elder Han had also underestimated Chen Tan.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
