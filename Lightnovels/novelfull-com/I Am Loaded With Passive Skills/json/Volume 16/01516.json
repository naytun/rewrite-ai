It was impossible that she hadn’t woken up, so she could only be pretending to be dead!</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>Sure enough, the moment he pinched her chubby cheeks, the little ‘loli’ who laid across his legs couldn’t take it anymore.</p><p>“Hey…Xu Xiaoshou, that hurts!”</p><p>“+(Cursed, Passive Points +) +1,+1,+1,+1…”</p><p>It was Little Junior Sister’s voice!</p><p>And the curse rang out when he pinched her cheeks!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up immediately. He cupped his Little Junior Sister’s face with both hands and propped her up. He said in surprise, “You’re back?”</p><p>“Hmph Hmph!” Mu Zixi opened her eyes. The God Devil Eyes had already disappeared and in its place were a pair of lively eyes.</p><p>She said, “What, can’t I come back?”</p><p>“Hahaha!” Xu Xiaoshou was overjoyed. She had really returned!</p><p>He gave her a tight hug, then pushed her away and asked, “Where is she?”</p><p>The ‘she’ he referred to naturally meant Lei Xi’er. She couldn’t have died, right? She should have only withdrawn.</p><p>“When I am awake, she’ll naturally be asleep.” Mu Zixi’s eyes flashed. She placed her hands on her hips and stuck her chest out. “What? You can’t bear the thought of that?”</p><p>“+(Cursed. Passive Points +)+1,+1,+1,+1…</p><p>“Tsk, tsk.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the Information Bar. He shook his head and sighed.</p><p>This was a big change.</p><p>Did he really get her back? If he had known, he would have tried it earlier. Actually, no, that was not a good idea!</p><p>But…</p><p>I’m not used to this!</p><p>How could a beautiful woman with such a graceful figure have withdrawn so completely?</p><p>“Can’t you change your will back without any changes to your body?” Xu Xiaoshou asked with a strange expression.</p><p>“You…” Mu Zixi was extremely angry. She clenched her fist and was about to hit him. However, just as she took a step, it was as if she was still not used to her body. “Ah!” she screamed, stumbled and almost fell.</p><p>This was too weak… Xu Xiaoshou was stunned and quickly held her. He thought to himself that when Lei Xi’er appeared, she didn’t have to go through this absurd process that required her to adapt to her body.</p><p>“Where are your God Devil Eyes? Can you still use it?” Xu Xiaoshou stared at his Little Junior Sister’s eyes and thought, “Could it be that your combat strength has returned to the Innate State? Your cultivation level is now at the Sovereign Dao Realm level.”</p><p>“Of course it can be used!”</p><p>The little lass obviously thought she was being looked down upon. She lowered her head unhappily for a while, then turned her face to the side and blinked a few times.</p><p>However, even after she blinked for some time, the God Devil Eyes still hadn’t appeared!</p><p>When she saw Xu Xiaoshou staring at her in shock, she was so angry that her face turned red. “Wait a minute, I have to get used to it…”</p><p>As soon as she finished speaking, a thick spiritual source was mobilized.</p><p>Mu Zixi’s eyes flashed, and black and white mist appeared in each eye. The God Devil Eyes seemed to have been summoned.</p><p>“Look!” The little girl immediately put her hands on her hips, and her little face was filled with joy. “My God Devil Eyes are invincible in this world!”</p><p>“You should stop bragging. In a battle, by the time you summon your skill, God knows how many people would have died already!” Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>She had transformed back, but her combat strength had not been reduced by 10% or 20%. Now her strength was as useful as that of a three-legged cat!</p><p>Mu Zixi seemed to have realized this as well. She lowered her head and blushed. “I just came out. I have to get used to my body…”</p><p>She gathered up her loose black hair and frowned. She then lowered her head and gripped her black dress as she pouted angrily.</p><p>It was obvious that she was not used to all of this.</p><p>Mu Zixi didn’t even care about her Senior Brother whom she had just met. She took a few steps, then flew away and said as she left.</p><p>“I’ll go and get used to it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared silently at the little ‘loli’ in the black dress. He felt that from the back view, apart from her height, figure, and hair color, she really did look like Lei Xi’er.</p><p>He didn’t stop her and just watched her leave.</p><p>“I really made you return…”</p><p>He had never expected that the biggest surprise brought by the ‘Freeze’ ability’s Awakening skill would be the return of his Junior Sister.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt like he was in a dream, and he had a new understanding of the Ultimate Life Demon Physique.</p><p>Perhaps, in the future, when Little Junior Sister encountered a life and death situation and couldn’t win, she could ask Lei Xi’er to come out and help?</p><p>What kind of situation was this?</p><p>Was this considered an illness?</p><p>How do I treat it!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou searched through the Cooking Expert but couldn’t find a solution.</p><p>After all, this was the Cooking Expert and not ‘Medical Expert’. Conducting Alchemy was just a side effect of this Expertise Passive Skill.</p><p>“Forget it, we’ll cross the bridge when we get there.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could only comfort himself in this way.</p><p>Little Junior Sister was not worried at all. She came back as if nothing had happened. It was as if she had just woken up from a long sleep. She did not forget anything from the past and was still the same person.</p><p>Then why was he so worried?</p><p>The Yuan Mansion suddenly became a brighter place and Xu Xiaoshou’s mood was inexplicably lifted. He felt that it was time to get back to business.</p><p>No matter how slow Little Junior Sister was, given some time to adapt, as long as she could control the God Devil Eyes with her Sovereign Dao Realm cultivation level, it would be a piece of cake for her to beat him before he had the ‘Freeze’ ability.</p><p>If he didn’t add any more points, he would really be surpassed by that girl!</p><p>“They’re all cheating. Each one is more outrageous than the other…”</p><p>After he complained silently, Xu Xiaoshou focused on the Passive System column on the Red Interface of the Extended Passive System in his mind.</p><p>There, there was only one skill left that had not awakened-Transformation!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
