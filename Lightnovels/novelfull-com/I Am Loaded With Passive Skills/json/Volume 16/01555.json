(3)</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Ye Xiao with a faint smile and knocked on the door of the Sky Three’s cell. He said calmly,</p><p>“Even if I take away all the instruments of torture here and remove the God execution token, I can still unseal and maintain your seal as I please. Do you know what this means?”</p><p>“Remember, you are Elder Han, right? You only have one question left. If you know how to talk nicely, then talk nicely. My patience is limited.”</p><p>The Hall of Unforgivable Crimes immediately fell into a deathly silence again.</p><p>In a hall with only two of them, Ye Xiao was undoubtedly the one who had the upper hand. She was in charge of all life and death here.</p><p>However, when this place became a tripartite balance, Xu Xiaoshou would be able to stand up for himself.</p><p>He was most afraid of an environment with few people because the factors that could affect the result would also be very few.</p><p>However, once the situation became complicated, he would be like a fish in water, just like when he was toying with Teng Shanhai and Jiang Buyi.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was never afraid of complications, but he was afraid of reckless men!</p><p>There was still a passage to the outside world at the hole in the seal of Sky Three’s cell, which was poked out by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He believed that Elder Han knew what the pros and cons were, just like how Elder Han was a smart man. When the seal was broken, they chose to observe the two people outside before appearing in the direction of the sound.</p><p>Not long after, an embarrassed and uneasy voice sounded in the cell.</p><p>“B-big brother, can you give me a chance? Yours truly… Uh, I don’t want to be sealed anymore. How long can your move seal this place… I-I want to come out…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and laughed.</p><p>“A year at least, three years at most.”</p><p>“If I’m willing to fork out some of my family’s resources, I’ll wait for the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes’ power to be completely drained by the spiritual array before putting in a few more… Yes, if it’s a high-grade spirit medicine or crystal, sealing you for ten years won’t be a problem.”</p><p>“In short, I can always wait until the First Hall of Sins space is distorted before I choose to leave. If I’m trapped here forever, you’ll never be able to get out.”</p><p>“Release…” Elder Han’s voice suddenly became high-pitched, as if they wanted to say something.</p><p>“Alright, you have used up your three questions.” Xu Xiaoshou blocked the hole he had made and repaired all the spiritual arrays. Elder Han’s voice also stopped.</p><p>He looked at Ye Xiao.</p><p>This Dark Division Chief was standing above the necromancer. She used to be arrogant and disdainful, but now it seemed that she could no longer suppress him.</p><p>“Miss Ye Xiao, may I ask you a question?” Xu Xiaoshou leaned against the cell door and asked casually as if he had found some security.</p><p>Ye Xiao was silent.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took her silence as consent and said, “God’s execution token? what is that?”</p><p>As soon as he said that, he felt Ye Xiao’s aura turn cold. At the same time, the necromancer’s muscular body moved and the scepter in its hand was raised.</p><p>Smart people knew what the other party wanted to do.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou instantly understood that Ye Xiao wanted to take advantage of the time when Elder Han was sealed again to end him.</p><p>After all, at this moment, without the influence of the third party, Ye Xiao was the master here!</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>The demonic eye of the god of death opened again in the sky behind Ye Xiao, and the darkness that represented death shrouded everything.</p><p>The necromancer swung its scepter, and thirty-six rays of soul-extinguishing light fell from the sky, more terrifying than the ones that it had used when attacking the sealing fence!</p><p>“Ambushed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed.</p><p>“You really deserve to die, Ye Xiao…”</p><p>In the face of such an attack, he didn’t even move. Instead, he gently shattered the spiritual array seal on the cell door behind him.</p><p>At the same time, the sounds from the cell door could finally be heard again.</p><p>“WAHH”</p><p>“Dammit! Die! Die!”</p><p>“Chen Tan, you’d better not let this Elder catch you… Ah?”</p><p>Without a doubt, Elder Han could sense the commotion outside. At the same time, it could hear someone knocking on the cell door.</p><p>“One chance.”</p><p>This was Chen Tan’s voice!</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>Without any hesitation, frosty white air began to seep out from the hole. The air rose up high, but it did not touch Chen Tan at all. Instead, it condensed into half a pair of huge bat-shaped ice wings in front of him.</p><p>These ice wings exuded the might of a demi-saint!</p><p>“Boom boom boom…”</p><p>With just one flap, thirty-six rays of destructive light containing the power of the death god were blown away by the ice wings, and they bounced toward Ye Xiao and the Necromancer. Meanwhile the ice wings… There wasn’t a single bit of damage!</p><p>At the same time, a bitter laugh mixed with a bit of hysteria and a horrifying voice that was forced to offer allegiance rippled from the hole.</p><p>“Who dares to touch my people? Ah!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
