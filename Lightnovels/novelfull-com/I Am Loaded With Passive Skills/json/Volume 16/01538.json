Xu Xiaoshou had used too many awakened skills, even the recently drawn “Acalanātha”.</p><p>The void servant thought that their opponent was only using his physical strength…Yes and no.</p><p>With a swoosh, Xu Xiaoshou became small and returned to his human form. He only used a very short “Vanishing Technique” to change into a new set of clothes to cover his embarrassment.</p><p>“I’ve lost my composure.”</p><p>When he returned to Master Siren and the others, Xu Xiaoshou’s irritation had been greatly relieved.</p><p>He didn’t want to think about it anymore. No matter what, he was destined to be defeated.</p><p>However, it was already a huge breakthrough to be able to grow to the point where he could rival the void servant in a short period of time. He had to look at everything in a positive light!</p><p>“The battle isn’t over yet …” Xiao Kongtong looked at the void servant who had returned and stood up amidst the roar, and said hesitantly.</p><p>The strength of a void servant was that it could even devour Holy Power and other forces, so even though it had been blown away by Xu Xiaoshou’s punch just now, it did not mean that it had been defeated.</p><p>On the contrary, after absorbing the power of the punch, the void servant’s condition did not drop much, and it still had the strength to fight.</p><p>At this moment, it patted its chest and roared, staring at the shrunken Xu Xiaoshou of the giant race. It shouted madly, but its heart was palpitating, and it did not dare to move forward.</p><p>Obviously, it knew that ordinary people would have exhausted their strength from such a punch, but the “fellow giant” was in the same state as it, still full of power.</p><p>“Yes, the battle isn’t over yet, but there’s no need to waste any more time.” After venting his anger, Xu Xiaoshou verified his current combat strength and said with a smile,</p><p>“If we continue fighting, I won’t be able to kill this big guy even if I use my Ancient Sword Techniques. I know this.”</p><p>“So, it’s time for you two great seniors to make your move. The countdown is still there, so we can’t waste time.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was silent for a moment.</p><p>These words were comforting because even he was not 100% sure that he could kill the void servant. This giant who could devour other people’s power was too strange.</p><p>Especially since they were in the First Hall of Sins on Abyss Island, which was their home ground.</p><p>“But you have a way to solve the problem faster without having to fight.” Xiao Kongtong said pointedly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew what this Eldest Senior Brother was implying, but he laughed it off, “Hong is not a captive. I can order it to do something, but I don’t think it’s a good idea to let it deal with its former subordinates.”</p><p>The four-man party only knew a little about the Death Exemption Token and had no idea where to exchange for it.</p><p>The first void servant they had encountered in the First Hall of Sin was undoubtedly the best choice to ask for directions. There was no need to mention it, as the three of them were well aware of this.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had also thought of asking void general Hong to take action. Presumably, with a “general”, it would be easier to ask questions compared to a “servant”.</p><p>However, when he put himself in Hong’s shoes and thought about it again, he felt that this was not a good idea. At least he needed to take care of Hong’s emotions and not just use him as a tool.</p><p>Moreover, if he was really released, void general Hong, who only knew how to “fight,” would probably kill everything and leave no survivors.</p><p>“I didn’t think of that, sorry.” Xiao Kongtong nodded in understanding, but to suppress the void servant, even he would have to pay a price.</p><p>“This old man will do it,” Mei Siren spoke.</p><p>From the moment he had been Xu Xiaoshou’s bodyguard, he had already been prepared to become a tool.</p><p>In a place as dangerous as the First Hall of Sins, letting Xiao Kongtong waste his energy to deal with the void servant would clearly be disadvantageous to them in the case of special situations that might arise later.</p><p>Therefore, the best choice against this void servant was for him to take action. After all, it would be a piece of cake.</p><p>“You just need to use ‘sword image’ to suppress it, and I’ll do the questioning.” Xu Xiaoshou chuckled and felt that Master Siren had already seen through his little plan.</p><p>“There’s no need for that.” Mei Siren didn’t care about this and just pulled out the stone sword from his back.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>When the sound of the sword rang out, the dark environment inside the labyrinth’s walls changed in an instant.</p><p>Everyone’s vision blurred as the scene changed to the battlefield in the Forest of Miracles.</p><p>The ruined ground, the broken ancient trees, and the flying dust… Everything was so lifelike, and the illusion was so intricately carved that every detail could be noticed and not easily detected.</p><p>In such an environment, all the existences that the void servant, who had been protecting the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, had feared the most had appeared!</p><p>There was demi-saint Jiang Buyi, who had turned into a cloud of immortal color and had the holy will’s pressure covering thousands of miles.</p><p>There was the Seven Sword Deity, Mei Siren, who had just killed the incarnation of a demi-saint with one sword while carrying a ferocious and evil sword elephant.</p><p>There was also a stream of light that came from the sky, a half-kneeling figure with a heavy sword piercing through his chest, void general Hong, whose eyes were filled with ghost fire!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t expect that Master Siren would use the illusionary sword technique to draw Hong out instead of summoning him.</p><p>The pressure from these three was too strong. As soon as they appeared, the dark void servant couldn’t withstand the pressure and fell to the ground on its knees. It looked up at the three monsters in front of him in shock.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
