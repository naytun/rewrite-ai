(3)</p><p>Perhaps, after I have always arranged for coincidences, I, Xu Xiaoshou finally encountered an actual coincidence this time?</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was an ally of the Xu Yue Grey Palace!</p><p>“I, Chen Ruye, also got involved in this by accident?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately puffed out his chest and said.</p><p>“Under my old master’s orders, I’m here to look for the Demi-Saint Ghost Beast, the Frost Ferret. Now that my mission is completed, I’m just waiting for Elder Han to be released from Sword Deity Rao’s hands. Her subordinate managed to locate me again.”</p><p>“When Elder Han is back, the Xu Yue Grey Palace will return to the martial arts world. Together with King Yama, we’ll be invincible!”</p><p>As soon as he said this, the world fell silent.</p><p>Ye Xiao, who was on the shoulder of the Necromancer, froze for a moment.</p><p>The eyes of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, who waited for his answer, was also dazed.</p><p>“+(Suspected, Passive Points+)+2.”</p><p>Ye Xiao was also dumbfounded.</p><p>She didn’t believe in Chen Tan and Chen Ruye’s identities.</p><p>But now, when she looked at the two figures below, no matter how absurd and ridiculous it felt to her, it seemed like this was the only explanation.</p><p>“Chen Tan, you really are…”</p><p>That was impossible!</p><p>How could Chen Tan be from the Xu Yue Grey Palace?</p><p>For a Ghost Beast host body, the first reaction when it encountered any danger would be to transform into a Ghost Beast.</p><p>Chen Tan… No, Chen Ruye had also been hit by the Ganges River in the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes and also been affected by Rao Yaoyao’s Saint Calamity. Then in the First Hall of Sins, he had been sent flying by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>From the beginning to the end, there was life-threatening danger all around!</p><p>However, other than his swordsmanship and evil technique, he did not reveal any Ghost Beast aura at all.</p><p>In this world, how could there be such a Ghost Beast host body?</p><p>Even Elder Han’s true Ghost Beast had been exposed when Chen Ruye attacked him. Which Ghost Beast Host Body could have so much endurance and did not even reveal even a little trace of its Ghost Beast power?</p><p>But…</p><p>“With your promise, I can rest assured.”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man believed it!</p><p>He actually believed it!</p><p>This Yama orange-masked man turned around and nodded solemnly at Chen Ruye from the Xu Yue Grey Palace.</p><p>“Remember, the alliance between the Xu Yue Grey Palace and Yama cannot be broken. Remember your promise.”</p><p>With that, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man no longer suppressed its power.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>The darkness in the sky suddenly dissipated like ice water that flowed down from the horizon.</p><p>The dense gray-black power of decay forced Ye Xiao’s power of death back and cleared half the sky.</p><p>At this moment, the desolation of the boundless wilderness emerged. The greenery that was full of vitality withered at a speed visible to the naked eye. It turned yellow, withered, and finally shattered.</p><p>The vitality of the entire space-time seemed to have been plundered by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. He slowly floated into the air, and the robe behind him suddenly exploded.</p><p>After his body absorbed the endless power of decay from the horizon, a huge, hideous monster condensed from the power of decay, the size and height of a Void Attendant, suddenly rose behind him.</p><p>“Lord of Calamity!”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s eyes flickered as he stared at Ye Xiao who was supposed to be a hunter, but instead it seemed he was staring at his prey. He slowly said, “This is my first gift to little brother Chen… And you, will die an unnatural death.”</p><p>Below, Xu Xiaoshou was in a mess.</p><p>He looked across the sky in the distance. On the left, there was an even larger Necromancer that was a thousand feet tall, had bulging muscles and had swallowed countless ghosts.</p><p>On the right was the Lord of Calamity that was as huge as the one on the left and belonged to the Body of Decay. Once it was born, even the world would tremble.</p><p>He was completely dumbfounded.</p><p>Why did the two strongest higher void and Demi- Saint start a fight?</p><p>So who can come over and tell me what the hell is going on?</p><p>Me!</p><p>Chen Ruye!</p><p>In short, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man challenged Ye Xiao for my sake?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
