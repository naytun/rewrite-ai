Sometimes, I have also been restricted by some strange abilities, so I’ve done some in-depth research on them.”</p><p>“In conclusion, there are only three ways to cultivate this bounded domain.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at his little Junior Sister and found that she was also listening curiously. He immediately asked, “Which three?”</p><p>“One, after the Sovereign Dao Realm, it will naturally form into a bounded domain. However, after the Dao Realm is perfected and the power of the Upanishad is comprehended, it will automatically transform into a bounded domain…This bounded domain is almost invincible. An ordinary bounded domain is as fragile as paper against them. This is the strongest bounded domain!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately thought of Master Dean’s ‘Lord of the Ten Thousand Realms’.</p><p>In the face of Ye Xiaotian’s Spatial Attributes, the flaws of the ordinary bounded domains were already exposed.</p><p>And when his Spatial Upanishad had reached the final-stage of the bounded domain, and the ‘Lord of Ten Thousand Realms’ opened, he could even break through hundreds of Sovereign Stage, regardless if their bounded domains were at the Dao Realm, Cutting Path Stage or Higher Void level.</p><p>He had already experienced this on the Lone Cliff.</p><p>It was indeed terrifying!</p><p>Mei Siren also nodded; he apparently agreed with what Xiao Kongtong said.</p><p>All his life, his focus had been on teaching the sword and fights were secondary. In this aspect, he didn’t have the right to speak like Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>“The second is when one reached the Sovereign Dao Realm and comprehended the power of the bounded domain. They can add special items to form a bounded domain.”</p><p>“The strength of such a bounded domain is related to the grade of the treasure that was added. It is even related to the special connection between different treasures. For example, it is best not to mix water and fire, or to mix yin and yang…”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong paused and said, “You should be able to imagine that even if the two water-type and fire-type supreme treasures at the Saint Stage were to fuse into the bounded domain, it would only bring about a huge explosion and not the formation of a bounded domain.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes immediately lit up. He felt as if he had been enlightened, and something that had been stuck in his mind had been jolted open.</p><p>Advanced explosion theory?</p><p>“I can indeed foresee that…” Xu Xiaoshou nodded thoughtfully. The door to a new world had suddenly opened.</p><p>Both Mei Siren and Xiao Kongtong nodded slightly. Only Mu Zixi felt that something was not right.</p><p>It can’t be…</p><p>What Xu Xiaoshou said about being able to foresee what would happen should be different from what you two imagined. He probably already had thoughts about the feasibility of this kind of ‘explosion’!</p><p>You guys should not have agreed, you should have stopped him!</p><p>The little girl’s eyes widened as she stared intently at her Senior Brother, as if she wanted to use her eyes to force him to reveal his true thoughts, but in the end, it was to no avail.</p><p>“+(Cursed, Passive Points+) +1,+1,+1,+1…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around and glanced at his Junior Sister. He thought to himself that this girl’s White Cave Small World should belong to the second situation.</p><p>At the same time as he cultivated the Sovereign Domain, he integrated an entire extradimensional space world.</p><p>Even in the five domains of the continent, this was extremely rare.</p><p>However, it was a pity that such a high-end ability had ended up in the hands of this silly girl whose eyes were filled with wisdom. It was a waste of such a heavenly gift!</p><p>“What if the second situation is added on to the first situation?” Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he could already see the bounded domain at the beginning, and the explosive transformation after he comprehended the profound mysteries.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong shook his head and gave a different answer. “It could be stronger, but it could also be weaker. In the worst case, it could even lead to the collapse of the bounded domain and damage the foundational roots.”</p><p>“Why?” Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>“Hehe!” Xiao Kongtong chuckled. “If the attribute of the special supreme treasure you added earlier turned out to be the same as the one you cultivated during your Spiritual Cultivation, but after you finally comprehended the power of the Upanishad, you realize that there is a fundamental difference between the two, wouldn’t the result of this situation be an even worse coexistence of water and fire, and the mixing of yin and yang?”</p><p>“I see…” Xu Xiaoshou’s imagination started to run wild again. There was such a concept? It’s more advanced than advanced!</p><p>When they saw how Xu Xiaoshou was enlightened, Mei Siren and Xiao Kongtong nodded in satisfaction.</p><p>To them, being able to lead a junior on the right path was a matter of great merit.</p><p>Only Mu Zixi, who was in a daze after what she heard, suddenly glanced at her Senior Brother. As expected, she saw him already deep in thought as he muttered under his breath and his eyes shone secretly…</p><p>It could not be!</p><p>Why did he give this guy so much information about ‘explosions’?</p><p>He was already a big enough threat to this world. They should not give him such high-level knowledge about explosives. He was already at the Sovereign Stage.</p><p>A battle at the Sovereign Stage, could cause the earth to shake and the space to crack.</p><p>Wasn’t summoning the bounded domain meant to ensure that the battle between them wouldn’t affect outsiders? If the purpose to summon the bounded domain led to a bigger explosion…</p><p>Mu Zixi shivered and shuddered.</p><p>She didn’t dare to let Xu Xiaoshou continue with his questions, so she forcibly changed the topic for her Senior Brother.</p><p>“What about the third situation?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
