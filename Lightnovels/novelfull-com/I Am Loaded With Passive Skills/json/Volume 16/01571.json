(2)</h1><p>1571 Frozen Ghost of the Ganges River, Shocking the Saint Without Word! (2)</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was sent flying.</p><p>He knew that he must have shouted aloud, but he couldn’t hear his own voice.</p><p>In the blurry and red world that rushed by him, he saw a line that stretched from the black hole in the Nine Heavens above. It penetrated through more than half of the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes and Rao Yaoyao was frozen in the middle. It stretched straight into the blue and white Ganges River in the abyss.</p><p>After the world spun one more round, Xu Xiaoshou caught sight of the outermost part of the ice-blue Ganges River, where the lower half of his body was also frozen.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally realized something.</p><p>It turned out that his frozen body had been shattered. The upper half of his body flew through the air and the blurry red world in front of him was caused by the blood that gushed out of his eye sockets.</p><p>He reached out his hand and wanted to wipe away the blood in front of him, but he found that he didn’t have any hands.</p><p>The image he received from his “Perception” was that the Ganges River had caused the lower half of his body to be frozen, while the upper half had been shattered by the explosive force of the river of starlight after it condensed into ice.</p><p>In the process of being flung away, his hands broke and his body turned into ice, inch by inch due to the small ripples of cold air at the edge of the Ganges River.</p><p>“You idiot!”</p><p>“You’re so stupid that you can’t be saved!”</p><p>“When a demi-saint attacking with all his might, how could you choose to use the Acalantha instead of disappearing?”</p><p>“You really think that you can use the Acalantha to resist what you think is a demi- saint’s attack after you tested it out, and that you can use it to resist the full-force attack of a true veteran demi-saint, right?”</p><p>“He was targeting Rao Yaoyao!”</p><p>“Your experiment can only partially block the Demi-saint’s Power. What level is Elder Han? How can you be so arrogant?”</p><p>In the Yuan Mansion, a man who looked exactly like Xu Xiaoshou roared crazily. Beside him, Greedy the Cat Spirit was so frightened that it didn’t dare to be distracted, and pretended to focus on conducting alchemy.</p><p>However, it saw its owner roar in rage as he ran toward the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer and muttered to himself.</p><p>“You’re really crazy. Is hiding your identity more important than your life? How could you make such a low-level mistake at such a critical moment?”</p><p>“Well, I don’t blame you… It was Jiang Buyi’s fault. That old man was too stupid and had been fooled by you. It’s also Mei Siren’s fault. He killed the Saint too easily and gave you the illusion that the Demi-Saint was not invincible.”</p><p>“You were only affected by the shockwaves, you won’t die. Your body will recover after a moment. After all, you have passive skills.”</p><p>“Even if it doesn’t work, a Rejuvenation Pill can bring you back to life. However, you’ll have to bear a bit of pain due to your broken limbs…”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit saw its owner muttering to himself. Then he suddenly stopped as if he was frozen on the spot.</p><p>In the next moment, he shuddered violently and clutched his chest as he panted heavily. The violent anger displayed earlier had also disappeared. His face was pale, as if he had been scared to death.</p><p>“Meow?” Only then did the Greedy the Cat Spirit dare to come over and ask.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hugged the cat tightly and took a deep breath. Then he raised it up and said solemnly, “Remember, I swear now that my life is more important in the future. I will never look down on anyone in the world. If I can’t do this, you can hit me and wake me up!”</p><p>“Meow?” Greedy the Cat Spirit raised its paw.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought for a while and laughed.</p><p>“But this time, I discovered another advantage of the second true body.”</p><p>“I would only feel the pain when he’s dead. He’s like an independent existence. He can even recover and help me bear the pain.”</p><p>“It’s just that it’s been hard on him. Forget it, I’ll make it up to him in the future!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou ran to the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer and wanted to pluck the Holy Medicine.</p><p>But after he thought about it, he realized that other than the pain, it seemed that the second true body would not die from the shockwaves of this battle.</p><p>Elder Han wasn’t targeting him, but Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>This time, he was almost killed purely because when immortals fought, mortals suffered.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought about it and did not pluck the Holy Medicine. He found the Little Rejuvenation Pill that he had made in his spare time and secretly sneaked it out.</p><p>The Hall of Unforgivable Crimes had been thoroughly penetrated by the icy blue Ganges River that fell from the sky.</p><p>The explosive power of the starlight not only broke Xu Xiaoshou’s Sovereign Level Physique and forced him to use his second true body to relieve the pain, but it also blew up the entire great hall.</p><p>All the instruments of torture, pillars, tables… All of them were destroyed.</p><p>The great hall had completely collapsed, and rocks rolled down continuously. It was like the ruins of a disaster.</p><p>And amid these ruins, Rao Yaoyao, who had been trapped in the center of the Ganges River and suffered the most intense injuries, didn’t seem to have put up any resistance and had frozen to death.</p><p>“Woo…”</p><p>Faint noises came from the four corners, but he couldn’t tell what they were.</p><p>The second true body had already recovered. It swallowed the Elixirs amid much cursing and used the medicinal power to quickly repair its damaged body.</p><p>He had been blasted into the cell and broke through a dozen sealing fences and thick walls before he stopped. At this moment, he hid in a blind spot among the ruins, as if he was dead.</p><p>At this point in the battle, everyone could not even protect themselves, so no one paid any attention to the others.</p><p>When the damaged body was repaired, the second true body trembled slightly. Xu Xiaoshou had returned.</p><p>“So miserable…”</p><p>As soon as he returned, he was shocked by the tragic scene. He shrank repeatedly into his damaged body and used his Perception to observe the outside world.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
