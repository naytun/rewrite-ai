(3)</p><p>Then, he stopped rigidly in midair, and even the speed of his thoughts slowed down, as if everything was frozen.</p><p>“What.. the hell… what’s the meaning of this?”</p><p>After decisively ending the Awakening ability, Xu Xiaoshou regained his mobility and scratched his head.</p><p>“I didn’t consume my Spiritual Source, and nothing else was consumed. This Awakening ability is used to restrain myself and help the enemy?” Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded.</p><p>He quickly realized that something was wrong.</p><p>Perhaps, this defensive Awakening ability was used to immobilize himself and to defend against the enemy’s attack?</p><p>“But I’m in the ‘Freeze’ state, so I can’t move, let alone use any other moves. This Awakening ability forced me to be controlled by one move… is that a rotten skill or what?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou never thought that an Awakening ability would deceive him. All the previous divine skills told him that it was impossible.</p><p>It was a dead end. If one wanted to walk ahead, one had to use various methods.</p><p>“Alright, let’s see how much damage this ‘Freeze’ ability can take!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked around, and finally, he arrived at a vacant desolate area in the Yuan Mansion. With a flip of his hand, he summoned the Infernal Original Seed.</p><p>“Seeds on All Five Fingers!”</p><p>The condensation of the five Refined Fire Seeds, under the influence of the Infernal Original Seed had already been upgraded to a Saint-Stage supreme treasure. Even Xu Xiaoshou himself was afraid of the explosion.</p><p>“In theory, if I don’t defend myself and only rely on my body to resist the five Refined Fire Seeds, then it will blow my body up. It won’t be enough to shatter my bones, but it could blow me into pieces.”</p><p>“If it’s the Saint Seeds on All Five Fingers, once you get hit, then you will definitely die!”</p><p>After he suppressed his trembling heart, Xu Xiaoshou threw the five Fire Seeds under his body.</p><p>He wanted to blow himself up!</p><p>He wanted to test the level of attack his new Awakened ability could defend against!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou used a pinching spell, then he flashed to the center of the explosion and shouted, “Freeze ability, activate!”</p><p>“Swish…”</p><p>A faint golden light spread out.</p><p>This time, he was prepared. Even if Xu Xiaoshou’s body was frozen and he couldn’t move, he could still see more clearly.</p><p>With his Perception, he could see that the golden light on the surface of his body had formed an illusion of a Buddha statue. It had a sacred look but upon closer inspection, the face was still his own face. It was the sacred version of Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>Other than that, his sluggish mind could also see that the five compressed Refined Fire Seeds below him were expanding at a rapid speed and then they exploded!</p><p>“Boom… boom… boom…”</p><p>A deafening blast reverberated throughout the entire Yuan Mansion.</p><p>Lei Xi’er, who was at the broken tower, instantly teleported over. She thought that someone had invaded this place. In the end, her God Devil Eyes swiveled about and she fixed her eyes on the Lord of the world, Xu Xiaoshou. Was he up to no good again?</p><p>“Huh!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was so angry that her cheeks puffed up. With a swish, she flew to the place where Xu Xiaoshou had destroyed.</p><p>“Didn’t I say this before? The Yuan Mansion cannot be blown up now! The Herb Garden of Divine Farmer is still here. Do you want to blow up all the Holy Medicine and destroy everything here?”</p><p>The huge mushroom-shaped cloud faded, but Lei Xi’er was still extremely angry.</p><p>But this time, she didn’t see the big fool who had been blown into black ashes in the explosion, unlike in the past. She only saw an even bigger fool who was clean and flawless, whose body was undamaged, but had gone completely crazy.</p><p>“Little Junior Sister!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was obviously very excited. When he turned his head and saw Lei Xi’er, he immediately hugged her and threw her up into the sky in celebration.</p><p>“Immune to damage!”</p><p>“It’s actually immune to attacks that are close to the Saint Stage power!</p><p>“We made it, Little Junior Sister, we made it!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er, who had been thrown into the air for no reason, was confused. She could not understand Xu Xiaoshou’s actions.</p><p>Did this guy’s illness act up again?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
