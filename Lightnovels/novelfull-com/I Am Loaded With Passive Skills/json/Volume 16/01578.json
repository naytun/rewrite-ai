Did it have any special meaning? Would he be able to get rewards and treasures if he broke this mechanism?</p><p>Her mind was filled with thoughts, but Mu Zixi did not dare to stop her actions.</p><p>This ‘Formation-breaking key’ came from Jiang Buyi. It was of a very high quality and might even be a holy product.</p><p>In short, he could even break the Spiritual Array seals of the various great Halls in the ancient First Hall of Sins, but he would need to inject a lot of spiritual source.</p><p>Fortunately, Mu Zixi didn’t lack spiritual source.</p><p>She drew upon the power of the White Cave Small World. Even if this key could drain an ordinary Sovereign Dao Realm dry, it would not consume too much of her energy.</p><p>Jiang Buyi waited quietly at the side. He was not impatient at all, even though the little girl in front of him poured out her spiritual source into the key at an extremely slow pace.</p><p>This was the only benefit of the forbidden puppet.</p><p>When he couldn’t make a move, he would use it to take his place and become a special spiritual source release machine.</p><p>Well, her spiritual source was endless…This was the same as the unknown in the First Hall of Sins. It was really strange!</p><p>Jiang Buyi did not dare to provoke this little girl. He was afraid of any accidents now. After all, there was the Five Decays of Heaven and Man before that.</p><p>After he got rid of the Body of Decay, Jiang Buyi made up his mind that before he found the exemption order, he would not break any anomaly that could operate in a stable manner.</p><p>Even if it came from the First Hall of Sins and was in the form of a forbidden puppet.</p><p>“Ka!”</p><p>The spiritual array cracked.</p><p>Not long after, the injection of spiritual source was complete.</p><p>Mu Zixi felt that as long as she twisted the key in her hand, the great array in front of her would be able to open the door that could allow three people to pass through, just like the previous three times.</p><p>She didn’t ask for permission, nor did she turn around. She calmly turned the key in her hand and twisted it gently.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>A violent explosion suddenly came from the distance. A strong sense of calamity covered the sky. The air waves rolled out from the shattered space and swept across the place.</p><p>“Pfft…”</p><p>Mu Zixi didn’t dare to resist. She didn’t even use her spiritual source and was swept away by the raging storm. Her small body was thrown into the air and she crashed heavily onto the ground and spat out blood.</p><p>Fortunately, the storm had been blocked by the labyrinth’s walls and had been considerably weakened by its many layers. Mu Zixi’s injuries were not serious, and she only felt a little pain in her butt and her internal organs shifted a little.</p><p>However, with such a strong Life force in her body, this was considered a slight injury.</p><p>“Saint Calamity?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi suddenly turned around and his pupils shrank. “Who would dare to transcend the Tribulation and become a Saint here? Are they crazy?”</p><p>The aura of the Saint Calamity was mixed with a trace of Sword Will. It was not obvious as it had been weakened by the various obstacles in the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>However, Jiang Buyi was not an ordinary person. He could still see it.</p><p>“Sword Will, Saint Ascension…”</p><p>All of a sudden, the encounter in the Forest of Miracles came to Jiang Buyi’s mind. He was bewildered. “Mei Siren?”</p><p>Not long after the Saint Calamity descended, Jiang Buyi felt the aura of a Demi-Saint from afar.</p><p>A cold gush of a Demi-Saint’s aura broke through the labyrinth’s wall from the left at an extreme speed and rushed to the other side without fear of death. It broke through countless obstacles, as if it didn’t care whether its actions would trigger an attack or the Ultimate Attribute punishment.</p><p>Behind it, the Sword Will aura that contained the Demi-Saint’s tribulation became increasingly obvious, and it chased after it.</p><p>“Ji…”</p><p>A shrill cry rang out.</p><p>Even though he did not see it, Jiang Buyi was slightly shocked when he felt it from afar.</p><p>Was there a Demi- Saint chase in the First Hall of Sins? And one of them had broken through the Way of the Sword to the Demi-Saint realm?</p><p>“He’s really crazy…”</p><p>Jiang Buyi, who had the ‘countdown to exile’ in his mind, could not understand this kind of suicidal move. He shook his head and stopped thinking about it. Anyway, he would not get involved.</p><p>At this moment, the spiritual array of Zhen Huang Palace was already open.</p><p>Jiang Buyi did not think too much and turned around to enter. However, when he turned his head, the forbidden puppet behind him had disappeared!</p><p>“D*mn!..”</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Buyi’s heart suddenly stopped. He was so scared that his scalp went numb.</p><p>His attention had only been diverted for a short while, and the forbidden puppet had disappeared? Where could she have gone to?</p><p>However, when he swept his eyes around, Jiang Buyi was surprised to find that the forbidden puppet girl was on the ground a short distance away. Blood flowed from the corners of her mouth. She did not disappear, nor did she enter his soul.</p><p>“Hu…”</p><p>Jiang Buyi heaved a long sigh of relief. Only then did the chills on his back disappear.</p><p>He immediately walked over and reached out to help the little girl up, but his hand stopped in mid-air, as if he had realized something. He then retracted his hand.</p><p>“Are you alright? Can you get up?” Jiang Buyi did not dare to touch the exquisite forbidden puppet and only asked in a gentle voice.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Jiang Buyi hesitated for a moment. He stared at the corner of the little girl’s mouth and gestured with his hand, “There’s blood.”</p><p>Mu Zixi looked at him calmly. After a long while, she stuck out her tongue and licked it.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s eyelids twitched. He chose to turn around and put some distance between them.</p><p>“Come, let’s go into the Great Hall first. It’s a little dangerous outside.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
