My mind and what I see are not on the same wave length anymore. Now, I am more than twice as slow!”</p><p>“There’s really someone here!”</p><p>“If he had wanted to attack me…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t believe it. In this situation where he had no power to resist, if someone really tried to attack him, he would have died easily.</p><p>However, he still did not give up.</p><p>“I can do it. I can get out of this predicament as long as I have the Spirit Awakening…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried his best to focus on the Information Bar, but other than the repeated ‘Startled’, the clicks, ticks, and buzzing of the sounds of time in his ears, he could not see any other information.</p><p>“It’s not about control…”</p><p>“It’s not an illusion…”</p><p>“It’s also not anything that would trigger my passive skill…”</p><p>“This is just a temporal displacement. It’s as if I’m in a normal space. It’s just that the timeline that my mind used and the timeline that my vision used have been perfectly separated into two parts.”</p><p>“Or it could be due to another state. My current physical state is normal, but because of the time displacement, my current state became very abnormal. This abnormality interfered with my normal state and made everything strange!”</p><p>“And I’m powerless to do anything about this!”</p><p>This terrifying transfer of the power of time almost drove Xu Xiaoshou crazy.</p><p>However, his body was already trembling with fear. The madness in his mind had just begun to brew and had not exploded yet!</p><p>“No, there’s no need to be afraid. Even in the most extreme of circumstances, I won’t die.”</p><p>“My second true body is hidden within the Yuan Mansion. I’ve already tested it out before. The functions of this awakened ability are ‘synchrony’ and ‘ability inheritance’…and ‘will transfer’ is a part of the ‘synchrony’.”</p><p>“Even if it’s in the Yuan Mansion, it’s still a part of me. As long as I want to, I can transfer the will of my main body to it, replace it and make it appear here and bear the risk of death.”</p><p>“As long as… there’s enough time for this thought to appear.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s consciousness was almost split into two parts. When the other half that was concerned about his own safety, thought of this, he heard the sound of footsteps on the stairs.</p><p>The other half of his consciousness, that had been paying attention to the movement here, was also affected. Finally, after the time delay when he saw the shadow of the person in the stairwell, he had an idea.</p><p>“Who… are… you!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shouted, but he felt that his shout was being broken down word by word, and his speech seemed to be very slow.</p><p>At the same time, the half-consciousness in his mind that was related to his own safety continued to move downwards.</p><p>“I don’t need to worry. Even if this thought of ‘will transfer’ can’t appear under this power of time, I won’t die.”</p><p>“As long as the second true body exists, how can the main body die? Even if my main body was completely destroyed, my thoughts and will can definitely be resurrected in my second true body!”</p><p>“After all, this second true body used half of my body, mind, and soul. It’s actually me!”</p><p>“At that time, I can use this ability to split again and create a second true body… There’s no end to it.”</p><p>“As long as this guy does not kill me and my second true body at the same time, I will not die instantly, just like the Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Ta!</p><p>The crisp sound of footsteps on the stairs shattered all of Xu Xiaoshou’s illusions.</p><p>In the next second, a soft gasp was heard.</p><p>“Oh, there’s someone here?”</p><p>The voice was warm and genial and instantly calmed the uneasiness and panic in one’s heart. It was as if it contained a great magical power that gave one a sense of peace.</p><p>After the soft gasp, the sound of rapid footsteps continued.</p><p>From the second floor of the attic, a young man who looked like a rich scholar came down the stairs.</p><p>He had a head of neatly combed black hair and not a single strand was out of place. His complexion was as smooth as jade, his eyes were as bright as the stars, and he had a noble temperament, like the spring breeze after the rain.</p><p>“I’m sorry. I didn’t expect anyone to come so soon. The environment here must have scared you.”</p><p>The young man who was dressed like a rich scholar hurried down the stairs, completely unaffected by the rich time power that filled the entire first floor. It was as if he walked in another time and space.</p><p>Under Xu Xiaoshou’s shocked gaze, he stopped and raised his right hand and pointed at the Void.</p><p>“Stop,”</p><p>One word settled everything.</p><p>The gears that hung on the wooden wall stopped rotating, the pendulum inside the wooden clock stopped at the highest point on the left, and the staff that transformed between illusion and reality was also stuck on the side that was visible.</p><p>Time had stopped!</p><p>“Chi…”</p><p>The invisible fluctuations rippled out again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could finally move.</p><p>He subconsciously lowered his hand that pressed on the wooden door, and he could clearly feel the soreness in his muscles. As he thought about it, he was shocked again.</p><p>“It felt like a century had passed, but everything that took place just now happened when I pressed my hand on the wooden door?”</p><p>All of his chaotic thoughts flooded back at this moment, and the jumbled thoughts that had been ‘controlled’ earlier exploded in his mind like fireworks.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a breath to match his reality with his thoughts, and his gaze fell on the face of the person who had arrived.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>He was just about to speak.</p><p>The scholar smiled brightly, and it was as if the world had lost its color. Only his warm words dominated everything.</p><p>“I’m really sorry. I’m used to the environment here and didn’t expect that the rich power of time here would trap the guests, so I stopped them first… You must’ve been scared, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou found it difficult to close his mouth. He felt that everything in the world, including time, had to wait till the scholar was done speaking.</p><p>It was only after that those outsiders could then interject.</p><p>But…</p><p>It’s good that you don’t have any ill intentions.</p><p>The Holy Emperor Dragon Scale would not lie. Damn it, I was scared to death just now!</p><p>Who was this guy?</p><p>Oh, right, I am not under anyone’s control now, so I can ask him directly.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>“Hello,” he said. The scholar discovered that the person in front of him remained speechless for sometime so he immediately took the initiative to speak in a friendly manner, “Hello, visitor from another world. I’m Kong Yuhen. Can you tell me your name?”</p><p>After a moment of stagnation, Xu Xaoshou’s thoughts exploded again like thunder, and he found it difficult to speak.</p><p>Visitor from another world…What did he mean?</p><p>And…Kong Yuhen? He was Kong Yuhen? The most mysterious of the Ten High Nobles, the Kong Yuhen who had completely disappeared after the War of the Ten High Nobles?</p><p>Was that really him?</p><p>Or was the name just a coincidence?</p><p>No!</p><p>The power of time here had already denied any kind of coincidences!</p><p>“Go ahead.”</p><p>Kong Yuhen, who was dressed like a young scholar, realized that he had interrupted the other party. He politely extended his hand and waited for the guest in front of him to introduce himself.</p><p>“Gulp!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s throat clenched.</p><p>At this moment, the images of Bazhun’an, Dao Qiongcang and all the other forms who were the equivalent of Kong Yuhen in their combat strength, flashed through his mind.</p><p>After he found out that this was a Spiritual Cultivator with the most unique Time Attribute, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t connect the name that had disappeared from the legends with this young scholar who didn’t look much older than him, who stood before him.</p><p>What he had faced just now seemed like the Ruler of time!</p><p>But now that he had appeared, he was so young and gentle…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was silent for a while. He suppressed all the ‘whys’ as well as his nervousness and fear. He decided to trust the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale and said very honestly…</p><p>“Hello, I’m Wen Ming.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
