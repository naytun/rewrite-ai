Instead, he asked curiously, “Senior Dragon Apricot, I heard that one can obtain the ‘ancestral dragon power’ after one has consumed 99 Dragon Apricots. Is this true?”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit’s drowsy eyes suddenly opened wide.</p><p>“Human, do not be too greedy!”</p><p>“Senior, I won’t take your Dragon Apricot for free. You’ve stayed in the Forest of Miracles for so long that I believe you’ve almost forgotten some of the pleasures from the past, right?” Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the 321 Dragon Apricots on the tree and said this calmly without any change in his expression.</p><p>If it bore fruit every 3000 years, even if there were still over 100 Dragon Apricots left on the Abyss Island when it was transplanted, it must have stayed in the Forest of Miracles for 5000 to 6000 years?</p><p>Oh, you can’t count it that way.</p><p>In theory, the Dragon Apricot bore fruit every 3000 years, but in fact, with the spiritual energy of the Abyss Island and the sustenance that the Dragon Apricot Spirit found for itself after it had a good sleep…</p><p>That would take thousands of years, right?</p><p>It was still a long time!</p><p>After such a long time, did the Dragon Apricot Spirit still remember the taste of dragon’s blood?</p><p>“Pleasures?”</p><p>After it heard this, a dazed look came over the Dragon Apricot Spirit’s two large dragon eyes and a look of reminiscence appeared in its eyes. It quickly narrowed them and asked, “Human, what do you mean?”</p><p>“What I meant was…dragon blood!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand and drew out a bucket of dragon blood from the corpse of the Gold-swallowing Dragon, that was half the height of a man, and was stored in the alchemy cauldron.</p><p>This amount was sufficient!</p><p>Ordinary people would find it a waste to use it for baths, let alone to drink it.</p><p>However, to match the Dragon Apricot Spirit and the Dragon Apricot’s large size, it was not too much, but at the same time, not too little.</p><p>As for the rest of the dragon blood…</p><p>Of course, Xu Xiaoshou had more!</p><p>However, he would not be so stupid as to offer up the entire corpse of the Gold-swallowing Dragon instantly. What was the difference between that and giving it away for free?</p><p>In the Yuan Mansion, as long as the master of that world, Xu Xiaoshou, wanted to, the Dragon Apricot, who was in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, would not be able to sense the existence of the corpse of the Gold-swallowing Dragon.</p><p>Thus, Xu Xiaoshou concluded that this cauldron of dragon blood could be exchanged for at least one more Dragon Apricot from the Dragon Apricot Spirit that had bathed in the ancestral dragon’s blood and turned into a spirit, but had not drunk the blood for tens of thousands of years!</p><p>Sure enough, just like when it saw the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale, the Dragon Apricot Spirit’s eyes exploded with light as it stared at the cauldron of dragon blood.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could even see that the desire in its eyes was even greater than when it saw the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale!</p><p>“Give it to me, and you can pluck an additional Dragon Apricot.” The Dragon Apricot Spirit issued the terms of the transaction instantly, even before Xu Xiaoshou said anything.</p><p>“You’ll be easily slaughtered at this rate!” Xu Xiaoshou snickered in his heart, but on the surface, he said with some embarrassment “Senior should know that dragon blood is hard to come by. I thought that you haven’t had dragon blood in a long while, so I only brought out a little.”</p><p>“Two, no, three!”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit tried to bargain, its gaze locked onto the cauldron of Golden Dragon blood, as it stood there without moving at all.</p><p>“Deal!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to haggle, so he decided on the price.</p><p>Dragon blood could not even be considered a Holy Medicine. Of course, Dragon blood from an entire Dragon corpse was an exception, and here, they were talking about a cauldron.</p><p>Its only use was that those who bathed in it would gain an increase in physical strength, but even ten cauldrons of dragon blood would probably not be worth as much as a single Dragon Apricot.</p><p>The corpse of the Gold-Swallowing Dragon lay in the Yuan Mansion. Xu Xiaoshou thought that he could probably extract a hundred or even a thousand times more dragon blood from it.</p><p>In one word:</p><p>It was valuable.</p><p>It was not a problem to take it out to do a trade and empty out the Dragon Apricot Spirit!</p><p>“Hold on.” At this moment, the Dragon Apricot Spirit seemed to have thought of something and vigilantly asked, “Where did this dragon blood come from?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little nervous, but he quickly realized what the Dragon Apricot Spirit meant. He smiled and said, “Senior Dragon Apricot, don’t worry. This is not one of the normal Dragon Clan from the Dragon Cave. This is dragon blood that I obtained after killing a traitor from the Dragon clan.”</p><p>After a pause, he added :</p><p>“There’s no karma!”</p><p>“Even if there’s karma, it’s my karma. It won’t bring you any trouble. After you are done drinking, you can continue to sleep.”</p><p>“Oof…” Only now did the Dragon Apricot Spirit nod its head in satisfaction. This human brat was quite smart; it knew what it was worried about.</p><p>“Hand it over.” After a wave of its claw, Xu Xiaoshou released his control, and the cauldron of dragon blood landed in front of the Dragon Apricot’s main body.</p><p>“Great…”</p><p>The moment the alchemy cauldron was tipped over, half of the viscous liquid directly flowed out. It passed through the Dragon Apricot Spirit’s wide open mouth and flowed onto the Dragon Apricot’s body.</p><p>“Delicious!”</p><p>“It’s really delicious!”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit was overjoyed.</p><p>He clearly didn’t drink it, which made Xu Xiaoshou puzzled. The dragon blood had passed through the Dragon Apricot Spirit’s spiritual physique, and it didn’t even swallow a single drop, so how could it be delicious?</p><p>However, on second thought, the Dragon blood was eventually poured onto the Dragon Apricot tree. As the main body of the Dragon Apricot Spirit, the spiritual physique of this ancestral tree could clearly taste it through this method.</p><p>Anyway, I still don’t understand what’s so delicious about this… Xu Xiaoshou still could not understand the pleasure derived from drinking blood.</p><p>“Awoooo…”</p><p>Soon, with a happy roar, the Dragon Apricot Spirit stopped itself from drinking all the Dragon blood and set the remaining half bucket of dragon blood in front of the Dragon Apricot and secured it with the power of law.</p><p>It lowered its head and sniffed deeply. Then, it looked up and said seriously, “It’s mine, outsiders are not allowed to touch it!”</p><p>“Yes, yes.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded in disdain.</p><p>It was just half a bucket of dragon blood, was that necessary?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
