Very useful! Smart people always like to overthink things. Their first reaction is always to overestimate the other party and think that they’re actually very wise but appear to be stupid. After all, it’s always right to treat trouble with caution. Smart people are always cautious.”</p><p>Mu Zixi once again fell into deep thought.</p><p>She felt that what Xu Xiaoshou said was all bullsh*t, but it seemed to make some sense.</p><p>She had a vague feeling that Xu Xiaoshou seemed to be insulting her with this sentence, but she couldn’t figure out where the insult lay.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed her head and said, “Great wisdom may appear to be stupidity. This is a brilliant realm. Some people need a lifetime to cultivate to this realm, but you are different…”</p><p>“How am I different?” Mu Zixi’s eyes lit up immediately. She felt that her Senior Brother was about to praise her.</p><p>Sure enough, Xu Xiaoshou was full of praises and did not hide his admiration and recognition for his cute little Junior Sister at all.”You were born to master this realm!”</p><p>Mu Zixi, who woke up a day later, had already forgotten what had happened next. In any case, she was sure that she had prevailed against Xu Xiaoshou and had not been put to work Conducting Alchemy to make soup.</p><p>She was glad that she had asked Xu Xiaoshou this question.</p><p>During the exchange, Mu Zixi had pretended to be Xu Xiaoshou and thought from Xu Xiaoshou’s point of view, either bluff her way through or get killed.</p><p>Now, Mu Zixi had learned her lesson. When she encountered Jiang Buyi, who was definitely a ‘smart person’, she chose the second method that Xu Xiaoshou had told her about.</p><p>Surprisingly, the method worked.</p><p>She did not answer any of Jiang Buyi’s questions.</p><p>Jiang Buyi chatted with her, but she ignored him.</p><p>Jiang Buyi wanted to kill her. He even released the Demi-Saint aura. She stared at Jiang Buyi blankly and then released the Demi-Saint’s Power.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was scared to death. He retreated hurriedly and addressed her as ‘Little Ancestor’ in such a humble manner!</p><p>He didn’t dare to act rashly anymore and chose to leave in the end.</p><p>Mu Zixi was afraid that this was a test. She was afraid that she would expose something when she was alone. In the end, what if Jiang Buyi had secretly monitored her every move and when he discovered something , he would kill her.</p><p>Or perhaps she might encounter another mishap after Jiang Buyi left.</p><p>In short, she did not dare to let Jiang Buyi, this scourge, leave. She could only grit her teeth and endure her fear. She imagined herself as a piece of dog-skin plaster, and then stuck to Jiang Buyi, this big oaf and used him as a bodyguard.</p><p>After Jiang Buyi was tailed by her, he became furious and wanted to attack again.</p><p>Mu Zixi stared at him blankly. She gazed at him calmly, without any murderous intent in her eyes.</p><p>Jiang Buyi addressed her as ‘Great Aunt’ and advised her to go her own way. After he received no response, he proposed that they leave together after some discussion and probing.</p><p>Mu Zixi finally reacted and nodded.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s face instantly turned pale. Then, he took a deep breath and turned to leave.</p><p>Mu Zixi did not understand why Jiang Buyi inhaled so heavily.</p><p>Mu Zixi did not understand why he addressed her as ‘Little Ancestor’ and ‘Great Aunt’.</p><p>However, Mu Zixi recalled another wave of teachings from her Senior Brother. He said, ‘When something works in a strange way, you should not interfere or change it forcefully. You should only follow the results.”</p><p>Mu Zixi did not understand why.</p><p>At that time, she had scoffed at her Senior Brother’s ‘teaching’ and didn’t even bother to ask why, because these words were sheer nonsense!</p><p>Now, she treated it as a valuable experience and put it to practice with her life.</p><p>“Brother Shou, come and save me! I’m really going to die soon!”</p><p>Mu Zixi wailed in her heart but her outward expression was calm and puppet-like. She took the key from Jiang Buyi in a dazed manner. She injected her Spiritual Source into the key and inserted it into the Spiritual Array in the Great Hall in front of her.</p><p>“Zhen Huang Palace!”</p><p>Without moving her eyes, Mu Zixi used her Spiritual Senses to scan the area and remembered the name of the Great Hall.</p><p>She didn’t know why there was a need to remember this, but it was the only thing she could do now. It might be meaningless, but it was very meaningful.</p><p>Jiang Buyi had very powerful abilities!</p><p>When she followed Xu Xiaoshou, Master Siren and Fringe Moon Immortal City’s Eldest Senior Brother, Mu Zixi knew that the three of them were still trapped in the maze and had lost their way.</p><p>However, when she followed Jiang Buyi…</p><p>In just one day, Jiang Buyi had used some unknown method to get out of the labyrinth many times.</p><p>Mu Zixi also remembered the names of the first three halls: Wu Xu Hall, Fei Yuan Hall, Netherworld Hall.</p><p>Compared to the ‘Zhen Huang Palace’ in front of her, Mu Zixi felt that what she did was meaningless but she had forcefully given it a meaning-her commitment of the names to memory had become really meaningful.</p><p>She found the difference.</p><p>The first three Great Halls were known as Halls, but this Hall was known as a palace.</p><p>This was a difference that was visible to the naked eye! A historic breakthrough! It was of great significance!</p><p>However, Mu Zixi couldn’t figure out what the inner meaning of this meaning that she had comprehended by herself had.</p><p>Jiang Buyi seemed to be searching for something.</p><p>However, he was extremely cautious and allowed himself to activate his spiritual array. After he entered every Great Hall, he was not tempted by the treasures at all and did not take anything.</p><p>He was like an idle tourist as he walked around in the hall. When he found that there was nothing he wanted, he left and carefully restored the Spiritual Array to its original state. It was a totally different image from the one she remembered when he tore apart the Elders of the Lei family.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
