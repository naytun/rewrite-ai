So, you were either extremely weak in the Demi-Saint realm and was thrown here; Or you were extremely strong and escaped from another place.”</p><p>“You’re not a human, because the Abyss Island has nothing to do with ordinary people!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly cut off his next sentence. “You are a Ghost Beast because the Ghost Beast is usually banished to the Abyss Island!”</p><p>He had his evidence.</p><p>From Elder Han’s previous remarks like ‘The one who was trapped in an inferior situation had to be humble’ and where he exposed himself when he said ‘You humans’. He had noticed that.</p><p>“You humans have an old saying that is good…”</p><p>Under normal circumstances, this should be what Elder Han was going to say!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou believed that Ye Xiao should have noticed it too. She was a smart woman, but she didn’t say anything and did not seem to care.</p><p>This was very normal!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t believe that the Holy Divine Palace had nothing to do with Elder Han being locked up here.</p><p>In other words, there was a high chance that Elder Han was Ye Xiao’s enemy, or at least, the two of them were on opposite sides.</p><p>In that case, what Elder Han wanted to do was to target Ye Xiao.</p><p>Now that he made such a big detour, what Elder Han had in mind was nothing more than to use him as a chess piece!</p><p>“I’m not a tool, Elder Han. Don’t treat me like a pig or a dog. That fool had already died on the way to the Abyss Island. Besides, this is the First Hall of Sins, the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes!” Xu Xiaoshou said meaningfully.</p><p>With the appearance of the Four Symbols Secret Realm, when he thought of Bazhun’an, everything made sense.</p><p>The only uncertainty was that Elder Han might be a third kind of existence besides the humans and Ghost Beasts, and that he might not be from the Inner Island of the Abyss Island and was not controlled by anyone. He might be an absolute Big Boss!</p><p>However, one thing was for sure. Ye Xiao was unwilling to mention this as she was afraid he might comprehend the whole situation and would completely lean towards Elder Han’s side…</p><p>Elder Han and the Holy Divine Palace were definitely on opposite sides. They weren’t completely unrelated!</p><p>“+(Surprised, Passive Points, +)+2.”</p><p>“+(Feared, Passive Points, +)+2.”</p><p>“+(Analyzed. Passive Points)+2.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The Information Bar was filled with pop-ups.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at Ye Xiao and was even more certain that this woman knew something. Just as he had expected, she knew everything but chose not to say anything!</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>There was only silence in the cell for a long time before a sharp burst of staccato laughter suddenly erupted. The sound was so shrill that it made people’s hair stand on end.</p><p>After a long time, Elder Han’s deep voice was heard. He sounded a little shocked and in disbelief.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>“You humans have already evolved to such a stage?”</p><p>“I’ve only made a slip of the tongue once. It’s just that I haven’t played such a trick for a long time, so I was a little negligent…”</p><p>He clearly knew where his only flaw lay, but his words also confirmed Chen Tan’s deduction.</p><p>“Brat, you’re right, you’re very smart, you’re really like me back in the days!”</p><p>Elder Han laughed again and said in a confidential tone.</p><p>“But you see, I will tell you everything you want to know. I can give you whatever you want.”</p><p>“We’re on the same side. With your intelligence, it would not be difficult for you to see our connection. You know what to do.”</p><p>“Let me out, and I’ll promise you three things, and you won’t regret it!”</p><p>In the cell, Elder Han made a solemn vow. His words were sonorous and powerful, as heavy as the weight of nine cauldrons.</p><p>“Pa!”</p><p>Xu Xaoshou struck the seal hole with a backhand.</p><p>Are you teasing a dog?</p><p>It’s like what I told you…</p><p>Do I really look that stupid and easy to fool?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned to look at Ye Xiao. He stood up and pointed at the water formed by the ice wings.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>The Necromancer waved his scepter, and Ye Xiao cooperated by clearing up the mess. She said, “You’re so smart that it’s frightening.”</p><p>Even she had not thought carefully through the information in Chen Tan’s words, in these circumstances even when he was under pressure from a Demi-Saint and then summarized in such a concise and orderly manner.</p><p>“+(Received praise. Passive Points),+1.”</p><p>“You’re too kind. You’re even scarier. Silence is golden and you’re a hundred times better than me.” Xu Xiaoshou chuckled indifferently.</p><p>“What do you want?” Ye Xiao asked bluntly.</p><p>Since they were all smart people, there was no need to beat around the bush.</p><p>Chen Tan knew that Elder Han was not on the same side as him, which was equivalent to having a handle on him.</p><p>Even if he didn’t know, as long as he guarded the door of the cell and released the seal when he was attacked, Elder Han would definitely protect him.</p><p>He was already in an undefeatable position!</p><p>Since that was the case, Chen Tan’s choice to point out all the problems must be in exchange for something.</p><p>Ye Xiao liked to get straight to the point, and she also hated nonsense, so she asked him bluntly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed. He held the seal on the cell door with one hand and opened it with the other. He was also being frank.</p><p>“First, I hope that you will stop thinking about the ‘God Execution Order’. At least, you won’t be able to remove it from the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes.”</p><p>Ye Xiao’s gaze fell on Chen Tan’s hand, which was placed on the cell door’s sealing Spiritual Array, and she nodded silently.</p><p>“Second, I have no intention of getting involved in the dispute between the Holy Divine Palace and this Demi-Saint. I chose to talk about it openly because I wanted to say this.”</p><p>“I’m not a tool nor am I an idiot. You guys can go ahead and fight, just don’t get me involved. I don’t want to die yet.”</p><p>Ye Xiao nodded again.</p><p>It was a wise decision for a gentleman to protect himself. She agreed with Chen Tan’s idea from the bottom of her heart. If she had been in Chen Tan’s position, she would have done the same.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
