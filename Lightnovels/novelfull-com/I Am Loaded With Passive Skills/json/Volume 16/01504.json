Just like this time, he looked much stronger than before.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>After he bid Master Siren and Xiao Kongtong a temporary goodbye, Xu Xiaoshou returned to the Yuan Mansion. The only thing he wanted to do was to make the best use of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer that he had shifted.</p><p>After all, his allergy to drugs had passed.</p><p>The Spiritual Source required for the three Master Stage realms had reached the final-stage with the support from the Holy Miracle Fruit and the contract with the Void General Hong.</p><p>This time around, he might even be able to break through to the Sovereign Dao Realm in the Yuan Mansion!</p><p>“I thought I could bring you a surprise gift. It was such a pity that I was a little careless when I went out this time round and almost got myself killed.” As he looked at the silver-haired girl in the Herb Garden, Xu Xiaoshou thought of his infatuation when he left the Yuan Mansion last time, and said this with some embarrassment.</p><p>“What do you mean?” The Holy Power on Lei Xi’er’s body flashed, and the small wooden pot in her hand also turned into a Spiritual Source that returned to her body.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou kicked the little white cat away and walked into the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer. He said seriously, “I met a Demi-saint from the Jiang clan in the Northern Region when I went out this time. ”</p><p>“Jiang?” Lei Xi’er’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>“Yes,” Xu Xiaoshou nodded. “Everything was already planned and he even fell into the trap. It’s a pity that I misjudged the strength of a Demi-Saint and couldn’t cut off his head.”</p><p>Even as he spoke of this, Xu Xiaoshou still had some lingering fear.</p><p>The Demi-Saint was too strong!</p><p>Even Master Siren’s sword could only cut off one of Jiang Buyi’s Demi-Saint Incarnations. What was he thinking at that time? How did he even dare to scheme against a Demi-Saint?</p><p>“Nonsense!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s beautiful eyes dimmed. She heard the underlying thrill of the process from his calm words. She couldn’t help but say, “I’ll settle my own matters in the future. A Demi-Saint is not someone you can deal with now.”</p><p>“You’re right.” Xu Xiaoshou agreed wholeheartedly.</p><p>He didn’t dwell on this matter. He looked around the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer and scanned it with his Perception. Xu Xiaoshou keenly sensed that the number of Holy Medicine had decreased by a little.</p><p>He was furious and turned to look at Greedy the Cat Spirit. “Little fat cat, you’ve stolen food again!”</p><p>“Meow, meow, meow,” Greedy the Cat Spirit protested.</p><p>There was a barrier around the Herb garden, and it couldn’t even enter, so how could it have stolen anything?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou easily understood Greedy the Cat Spirit’s message, and a strange look came over his face.</p><p>He discreetly used his Perception on Lei Xi’er who stood in front of him and found that her face was slightly red. Her expression was also a little stiff, and she seemed to be embarrassed.</p><p>“Uh, no way?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. Did Lei Xi’er secretly eat the herbs?</p><p>That’s impossible. She didn’t even care about the Holy Miracle Fruit before. How could she secretly eat the Holy Medicine in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer during his absence?</p><p>However, in the Yuan Mansion, other than Greedy the Cat Spirit and Lei Xi’er, there was no third party that would steal or eat the Holy Medicine.</p><p>For a moment, Xu Xiaoshou felt that this was very strange. After all, this kind of situation had happened before when his Junior Sister stole the life force of the Spirit Mark of Life.</p><p>“You…” Xu Xiaoshou paused for a moment and asked the silver-haired girl in front of him with a slightly amused smile, “Did you notice that some Holy Medicine has gone missing in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s delicate body trembled. She quickly turned her head and left the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer. She only made this parting remark, “I don’t know, but there’s something strange about the Dragon Apricot. You should be careful!”</p><p>Was this an inside job or what?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his chin and watched the girl leave with an amused smile.</p><p>There was so much Holy Medicine in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer. He didn’t care about those few Holy Medicine in that area. What he was surprised about was that Lei Xi’er’s behavior was like someone possessed by Junior Sister.</p><p>“Little Junior Sister, you’re really back?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou kept his curiosity in check and didn’t chase after her.</p><p>He felt that it was a good thing if she secretly ate the Holy Medicine. If Little Junior Sister was really awakened, it would be fine as long as she did it one step at a time.</p><p>If he was too deliberate and provoked Lei Xi’er and suppressed Little Junior Sister, then he would have done a bad thing even though he had good intentions.</p><p>“Dragon Apricot…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned to look at the center of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer as he mulled over Lei Xi’er’s parting remark.</p><p>There was no doubt that Lei Xi ‘er must have suddenly ‘craved’ the Dragon Apricot and had her eyes on it, but she encountered some accident when she tried to pick the Dragon Apricot.</p><p>After all, Xu Xiaoshou remembered the total number of Dragon Apricots there were: 321.</p><p>At this time, he counted again and found that there were no change to the number of Dragon Apricots.</p><p>“What kind of accident could have occurred?”</p><p>As he walked toward the direction of the Dragon Apricot, Xu Xiaoshou pondered in confusion.</p><p>His return to the Yuan Mansion this time around was precisely for the sake of the Dragon Apricot.</p><p>His cultivation level at the Star Worship State after the contract with the Void General Hong had already been pushed to the late-stage. If he had another Holy Medicine, his cultivation would definitely overflow.</p><p>As long as his comprehension of the realm could keep up with the overflow of his cultivation level, Xu Xiaoshou was sure that he was nearly at the breakthrough to the Sovereign Dao realm.</p><p>“After I consume 99 Dragon Apricots and obtain the ‘power of the Dragon ancestor’, I would then break through to the Sovereign Dao Realm. My combat strength would be pushed to another peak after I cultivate the two great sword techniques!”</p><p>This was Xu Xiaoshou’s plan.</p><p>But now, Lei Xi ‘er said that there was something strange about the Dragon Apricot?</p><p>“How are you?” Xu Xiaoshou asked curiously when he landed under the golden Dragon Apricot.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
