She was a little surprised, but that was all.</p><p>Elder Han used only one move to avert her attack that contained the power of the God of Death. Naturally, he couldn’t avoid exposing the Demi-Saint’s power contained in the Ice Wings attack.</p><p>However, even though he was sealed in the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes, Ye Xiao would never believe that Elder Han was just an ordinary higher void level.</p><p>Thus, this was something she had already expected, so she was not too surprised.</p><p>At the very least, he wasn’t a Holy Emperor.</p><p>But…</p><p>“This guy’s moves were a little too powerful. That’s an attack that contained the Power of the Ancestral Source and should not be that easily deflected?”</p><p>At this moment, the thought that appeared in Xu Xiaoshou’s mind was exactly the same as Ye Xiao’s.</p><p>He figured that Elder Han shouldn’t be only a simple Demi-Saint, and might even be one of the top Demi-Saints.</p><p>“I wonder how he fared when compared to Jiang Buyi…”</p><p>One was a Demi-Saint who had killed the threat in its cradle the moment the power of Demon God Aura emanated from Teng Shanhai.</p><p>One used his ice wings to deflect the attack of the God of Death with a mere wave of his hand.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not tell how Elder Han’s cultivation level was compared to Jiang Buyi’s. If these two people could compete in front of him and fight to the death…that would at best be a pure fantasy.</p><p>“You’re a Demi-Saint?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t pay much attention to Ye Xiao’s reaction after she was blown away by the attack. He glanced at the hole in the cell door with surprise and suspicion. “You’re a Demi-Saint, and you’re willing to address those below you as Big Brother? I don’t even dare to let you out.”</p><p>He was the first to show his weakness.</p><p>It was best to be clear about some things. He was afraid that the villain would remember these things and hold a grudge.</p><p>After all, the Demi-Saint had been forced to address Xu Xiaoshou as Big Brother due to the seal of the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes. Even if it was not his intention, it had become a fact.</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>When he heard this, Elder Han let out a strange cry, as if he didn’t care about such a small matter at all.</p><p>“You humans…Well, ‘the one who was trapped in an inferior situation had to be humble’. This is an old saying.”</p><p>“Kid, since you know my strength, I’ll give you one more chance. Will you let me out or not?”</p><p>“… Don’t worry, as long as I come out, I’ll let bygones be bygones and you can still live a good life.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at Ye Xiao, who no longer acted rashly, then he looked at the huge ice wings that protected him and said.</p><p>“I say, Elder Han, why don’t you wait for the seal to be completely broken before you say anything? This situation now is of your own making, so how would I dare to let you go?”</p><p>What he meant was that he was the one who had caused the current deadlock between the three forces.</p><p>If you Elder Han had taken advantage of the great battle to sneak out and put a stop to everything that happened in the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes with your Demi-Saint status, I’m afraid that so many things would not have happened and you would have been the one in control of the situation.</p><p>But now…</p><p>For someone who switched my identity to that of Chen Tan, would I dare to let out a Demi-Saint with an unknown background?</p><p>Elder Han, who was inside the cell, also fell silent. After a long time, he sighed and said, “Who would’ve thought that you would know about the Spiritual Array?”</p><p>Even if I don’t do anything about it, if you make a big ruckus here, it would have attracted Ye Xiao’s and my attention! So, it’s impossible for you to escape the normal way, and you can only rely on the power of others, right?</p><p>We were aware of this too. Everyone had a tacit understanding…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts started to wander.</p><p>He was actually quite knowledgeable, but through this conversation, he was even more certain that Elder Han was a smart person.</p><p>He was looking for a way out for him, but Elder Han was also giving him ‘face’. This was a Demi-Saint, shouldn’t he have the same high and mighty attitude as Jiang Buyi?</p><p>Even Ye Xiao issued orders in a brusque manner to her people when she summoned them</p><p>This Elder Han could be said to be the most polite, or rather, the most humble Demi-Saint he had ever met along the way. He could even address people below the level of Demi- Saint as Big Brother… Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t figure out Elder Han’s intentions.</p><p>“I feel like we can cooperate?” This thought flashed through his mind, but he was still a little uneasy. What if all this was just part of Elder Han’s trickery…</p><p>“Kid, you and I are the same kind of person. The only thing that is holding us back now is the ‘mutual trust’ rule. How about this, you help me break the seal of the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes and let me out first.”</p><p>“After I come out, I’ll help you deal with this woman. It’s just the power of the God of Death and the Body of Death, right? It’s useless against a Demi-Saint; what do you think?”</p><p>His tone was very sincere. Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes flickered as he began to plan his future.</p><p>The Information Bar jumped:</p><p>“+(Bewitched. Passive Points,+1).”</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Spirit Awakening!</p><p>The corners of Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth twitched. He scratched his head and said innocently, “I’ll have to consider it.”</p><p>“Chen Tan.” Ye Xiao, who was on the Necromancer’s shoulder, stopped her attacks and reminded him, “A Demi-Saint is like a king, you could get killed at any time. Don’t forget that the seal is still broken.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lowered his eyes, and as expected, the frosty white air in the cell constantly seeped through the holes into the ice wings that protected him and gave him a great sense of security.</p><p>“You stinky b*tch…” Elder Han’s rebuke rang out.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Elder Han. I need some time to think about it. I might have to lock you up for a while. After all, I can’t be sure if there will be two more corpses here after you come out.” Xu Xiaoshou’s tone was apologetic, as if he was embarrassed that he had to use a Demi-Saint as a tool to protect himself.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
