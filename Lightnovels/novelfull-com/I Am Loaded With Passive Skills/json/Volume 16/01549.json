It was made of an unknown dark silver ore and contained all kinds of gears and special springs. As long as one exerted a little force, the beast’s Fangs would snap and then rip apart.</p><p>The ‘cracked tooth’ instrument was not big, and it seemed to be custom-made for the size of a human. Very likely, it was used to deal with the ‘Abyss Island Sinners’ who had committed bad deeds.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshu was surprised… Well, of course, he was going to try it out in the role of a torturer, and not do something stupid like putting his foot in the mouth of a beast.</p><p>Bang! A loud sound echoed all around!</p><p>Merely with a light touch, the ‘cracked tooth’ instrument suddenly snapped shut and even tore apart the space. One could easily imagine how much pain the Abyss Island Sinner had undergone.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou broke out in goosebumps.</p><p>The loud noise also attracted Ye Xiao’s attention, but she only glanced at it and looked away without saying anything.</p><p>“Very powerful…” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes burned with passion.</p><p>Even a small tool had such a biting force. There were no less than hundreds of weapons here, and some were even very big. If they were to fight, they could just take them out and use them to smash people. It was simply a treasure vault.</p><p>“Split?” He looked up at Ye Xiao, but he did not get a response.</p><p>Boring…Xu Xiaoshou looked away from the dark-feathered woman and glanced at the cracked tooth instrument, then he shifted his gaze to Ye Xiao’s feet.</p><p>“No, endure it!”</p><p>“I’m not Xu Xiaoshou now, I’m Chen Tan. I’ve exposed too much greed… Uh, to covet the treasures is obviously not conducive to our next action. This woman is very sharp.”</p><p>In the end, Xu Xiaoshou suppressed the urge to bring the hundreds of treasures into his Yuan Mansion and followed Ye Xiao into the main Hall.</p><p>The layout of the main hall of the Hall of No Pardon was very strange.</p><p>There was only a huge table and chairs that could fit a giant. Some objects were scattered on top of it, and it faced the vast execution ground.</p><p>Obviously, this was the difference between the judge and the victim.</p><p>The strange thing was that there were no more murals around the main Hall, but only side rooms.</p><p>The size of the side rooms were the same. They were all very large and had the same door and standard iron bars. It was like a prison cell. The iron bars on the door looked cold and inaccessible.</p><p>Ye Xiao was the first to approach the third side room on the left side of the table. She seemed to have sensed something and stopped outside the door and she did not move or even touch anything there.</p><p>“Very cautious…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou came to the conclusion that this was actually the quality that an explorer should possess.</p><p>This ancient land was an obvious prison. Who knew what kind of danger lurked about should he touch the things here?</p><p>For a moment, Xu Xiaoshou felt ashamed at what he did at the ‘cracked tooth’ instrument and the idea he had to take all the torture instruments here.</p><p>That was clearly courting death, and he could have triggered some special Array, that may cause the Hall of No Pardon to collapse.</p><p>“Heavens…Three…”</p><p>His gaze shifted to the side room where Ye Xiao stood and there were two ancient characters there.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou read it out with a puzzled expression. Was this the third Heaven cell? Was his speculation true? Were there really prison cells around here?</p><p>“What?”</p><p>At this moment, as he followed her in, he looked up at the high table. There seemed to be something there that attracted peoples’ attention and made it even more alluring than the Heaven cell.</p><p>Treasure?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up and he flew up suddenly.</p><p>The table was meant for the Giants, and the legs of the table were as thick as the Pillars of Heaven.</p><p>In order not to expose his identity, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even dare to take the easy way out. He only relied on flying and landed on the table.</p><p>There were some giant objects scattered on the large platform, and on average, they were about a hundred feet in size.</p><p>However, these objects that were covered in dust did not attract Xu Xiaoshu’s attention. What he saw was a treasure that was about half the height of a man…A command token!</p><p>The old and ancient token emitted a faint glow. It was obviously a treasure, and it was extremely huge. However, compared to a giant, it was much smaller.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou picked it up and scanned it with his ‘Perception’. There was a distinctive character ‘Chi’ written on the front, which made people’s eyes go blank.</p><p>He flipped it over and two complex ancient characters were imprinted on it. They seemed to contain the power of Elites, and Xu Xiaoshou’s mind and soul were bombarded for a long time and he could not quite recover.</p><p>After he shook his head for a while, Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. He finally came back to his senses and recognized what the two big characters on the command token were.</p><p>“God-Slayer!”</p><p>Such great courage!</p><p>Who dared to write the word ‘God-Slayer’?</p><p>What did the ‘God’ here refer to? Was it the Sword God, Gu Lou Ying?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost laughed at the sight. Before he could think any further, a white hand covered in black feathers suddenly shot out rapidly and made a grab for him. At the same time, a hoarse and neutral female voice unique to Ye Xiao sounded beside him.</p><p>“Give it to me.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
