After he landed, there was a great battle after a verbal disagreement.</p><p>“Calm down, it’s time to get a hold of the situation!”</p><p>The outcome of the battle had undergone a shocking turn that Xu Xiaoshou had never expected.</p><p>This was crazy!</p><p>When did Rao Yaoyao become like this? She was really like a lunatic!</p><p>However, it had to be said that this fighting style was extremely suitable for her, a Sword Deity…No, perhaps in the future, she would be called a Sword Saint. Xu Xiaoshou didn’t think that this Rao character would fail to become a Saint.</p><p>“She’s not the key person now. I have to recall everything that happened in the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes and see if I had missed out on any details.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou diligently tried to gather his thoughts and focus on them.</p><p>In the Disappearing State, he had successfully turned from a marginal figure to being part of an irrelevant crowd, able to escape from all the attention, but this did not mean that he was fine.</p><p>What if he missed a single step, and Elder Han and Rao Yaoyao turned around to target him instead?</p><p>“First of all, Elder Han wanted to negotiate. According to Rao Yaoyao, this Frost Ferret came from the Inner Island of the Abyss Island, so there’s a high chance that he’s Bazhun’an’s chess piece and also a small chance that he’s not.”</p><p>“No matter what, since I know all this, I have to communicate with them even if I have to risk my life. If we can cooperate or even make use of them in the end…” Yes, he definitely couldn’t negotiate now. Whether Elder Han managed to escape Rao Yaoyao’s Saint Calamity was another matter. He was good at escaping, so perhaps he could…”Eh, I definitely can’t negotiate with them. When the time comes, I’ll hand them over to the second true body.”</p><p>In a split second, Xu Xiaoshou made a decision about Elder Han and his attention returned to the closed labyrinth passage behind him.</p><p>This meant that the only path to both the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes and the labyrinth of the First Hall of Sins had disappeared.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had emerged after the chase between Elder Han and Rao Yaoyao; it was just that they had run in different directions.</p><p>After he came out, he deliberately waited for a while, but unfortunately, he didn’t see the other person come out.</p><p>“Ye Xiao is dead?”</p><p>“Otherwise, why did she not come out?”</p><p>“She shouldn’t be dead…It’s just a Saint Calamity, and I’m still safe and sound. She looked seriously injured, but she must have a life-saving trump card. There’s no way she could be dead!”</p><p>“So, she might have already come out. But why didn’t I see her? When did she come out?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes swiveled and he subconsciously observed himself carefully.</p><p>There was no sign of being possessed, and there was no danger notification in the Information Bar. Ye Xiao could not have turned into a spirit and followed him. It was always at the blind spot behind his head, regardless of whether he turned back or not.</p><p>“I’m in trouble…”</p><p>No matter how crazy and chaotic things were on the surface, Xu Xiaoshou was not afraid, even if it was a Demi-Saint who played the long-distance chase and escape battle.</p><p>He was most afraid of this kind of person who took advantage of the chaos and slipped into the darkness like himself and then reaped the benefits from the confusion – a person who led the development of the situation.</p><p>The Dark Division Chief was truly a Dark Division Chief. When he disappeared, she also went missing.</p><p>“What a sinister and disgusting ability!”</p><p>He cursed in his heart and decided not to think about it anymore. He had disappeared anyway, and Ye Xiao couldn’t possibly still keep an eye on him, right?</p><p>He carefully recalled the details that he had stopped thinking about because of various reasons at the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes. It could be due to the tense situation, or it could be subjective.</p><p>From the beginning to the end, he did not miss out on a single thing.</p><p>After all, when one dealt with these smart people, one wrong move and one would die.</p><p>“My identity shouldn’t have been exposed. Chen Tan did a good job, but there’s one thing I have to be wary of…When I first entered the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes, I grabbed Ye Xiao’s hand, and that was the only time I’ve had any contact with her!”</p><p>“I have ‘Stealth’ and I had just entered the Great Hall. When under stress, the first choice of a normal person would definitely be to resist, not to infiltrate the other party’s body with spiritual source to observe the enemy. This is an act akin to seeking death… Well, I’ve never felt Ye Xiao do something like that before.”</p><p>“From Ye Xiao’s reaction, she didn’t recognize me, and there was no notification in the Information Bar…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chose to believe in his own deduction.</p><p>Otherwise, if Ye Xiao faced Chen Tan, whom she knew was Xu Xiaoshou, she would not have been so calm.</p><p>“There’s one more thing…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was the Ruler of the red-clothed people, so it’s normal for her to know about Elder Han’s past. But I’m merely Chen Tan. Why did she carry on with her explanation about the Ghost Beasts to Ye Xiao, even though she knew I was there?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fell into deep thought. This was something he had noticed at the time.</p><p>When Rao Yaoyao spoke to her, Ye Xiao’s expression clearly changed, but Rao Yaoyao remained unmoved and continued to tell her all the information about the Ghost Beasts.</p><p>Ghost Beast…</p><p>Rao Yaoyao did not mind that a stranger knew about the information of the Ghost Beasts on the Shengshen Continent, where everyone kept it a secret after they came to the Abyss Island?</p><p>Or was she so stupid that she didn’t realize that Chen Tan could eavesdrop on her conversation?</p><p>“She regarded me as one of her own!” Xu Xiaoshou quickly got the answer.</p><p>“… Chen Tan displayed the Power of the evil God and even Ye Xiao didn’t want to attack him. She wanted theGod Execution Order, and she wanted me to join the Holy Divine Palace.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
