It was understandable that Xu Xiaoshou was talented in swordsmanship, but how could his body be so abnormal?</p><p>He wondered what exactly was happening now… In the beginning, humans had no chance of winning against the Giant Clan with just physical strength. Now, they could even exchange two or three moves?</p><p>Three punches, each stronger than the last.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong couldn’t even tell the limits of Xu Xiaoshou’s physical body!</p><p>This guy wouldn’t force the void servant back with his next punch, would he? Could he actually be a giant that took the form of a human?</p><p>“Did he use the void general’s power?” Xiao Kongtong couldn’t help but turn to look at Master Siren, thinking that there must be some traces of the Phantom Swords Technique, but he didn’t see it.</p><p>“No, I haven’t taught him this move yet.” After Mei Siren regained his calm, he shook his head slowly.</p><p>“What an outstanding person.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong finally understood why Xu Xiaoshou was first the disciple of Elder Sleeveless, and then the person who had captured the attention of other big bosses.</p><p>The Infernal Lineage of the Holy Palace were all monsters with physical bodies.</p><p>“I think I can defeat you!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, in his human form, looked up in the air and waited for the void servant. His aura was bursting with confidence and was not inferior to the void servant.</p><p>For the sake of fairness, he didn’t even use his aura to crush the other party.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The void servant bowed and roared. He could hear the provocation and mockery in the human’s words.</p><p>However, before it could do anything, the human brat in its eyes had changed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly bent over and held onto the air. His body expanded by one foot, three feet, ten feet…Thirty feet!</p><p>The golden light on his body also became brighter and brighter, from tiny golden spots to dazzling, gorgeous, breathtaking… It was close to the golden sun!</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was dumbfounded. The appearance of such a huge person had made his head numb. He turned to Master Siren and asked, “You really didn’t teach him how to use the Red Ghost Inscription to manipulate his spirit soul’s power?”</p><p>Mei Siren looked at Xu Xiaoshou, who had suddenly grown in size, and hesitation appeared in his eyes. He replied, “I don’t think so?”</p><p>Only Mu Zixi, who already knew that ‘Xu Xiaoshou was a giant’ was not surprised at all. She had seen even more exaggerated changes than this. That was the Black Demon Giant version with Ice and Fire special effects.</p><p>“Do you know about this ability of Xu Xiaoshou?” It was obvious that this kind of calmness was unusual. Mei Siren and Xiao Kongtong immediately looked at Mu Zixi.</p><p>The little girl nodded and pointed her finger in the air. “Berserk Giant.”</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The Golden Giant descended from the sky and rose into the air. It was a hundred feet tall, dazzling and imposing.</p><p>As it stood side by side with the dark void servant, the passage in the maze suddenly became slightly crowded.</p><p>This place could accommodate giants.</p><p>However, it was clear that a battle between giants had never been set in stone.</p><p>“Roar?” The void servant was also dumbfounded.</p><p>Same race?</p><p>The human was from the same race as it?</p><p>But why was he golden?</p><p>Before it could open its mouth, it saw the Golden Giant, who had released his true form, raise his fist without any explanation. His scarlet eyes were full of fighting spirit.</p><p>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”</p><p>The void servant’s eyes were also filled with anger. It didn’t have time to think and followed up with a fist.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>The dark mist within the labyrinth’s walls seemed to have been instantly dispersed by this punch.</p><p>The black and golden airwaves in the sky were equally matched, like a battle between day and night.</p><p>The void servant could feel that its body was devouring the power of the other side. It tried its best to amplify its advantage. It wanted to knock down the other side and regain the dignity of the Black Giant Clan.</p><p>However, at the same time, Xu Xiaoshou’s Golden Berserk Giant could also feel his passive skills, such as “transformation,” “Eternal Vitality” and “High Spirits” running wildly. Part of it was devouring his opponent’s power for its own use, while the other part was creating vitality and healing its own wounds.</p><p>“Get…”</p><p>The exchange of fists lasted for more than ten breaths. When Xu Xiaoshou felt that he couldn’t hold on any longer, he no longer hid his trump card and closed “Acalanātha” after only 0.1 milliseconds.</p><p>At a certain moment, the void servant felt its power acting on cotton. This caused it to completely lose its balance and stagger.</p><p>In the next second, the giant, whose body seemed to have disappeared for a moment, poured all the power in his fist into the void servant’s body, which had lost its balance.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>One punch.</p><p>There was a loud explosion.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had transformed into a violent giant, used the most primitive way of fighting to send the void servant flying. The void servant slammed into the wall at the end of the maze and was embedded in it.</p><p>Suspected. Passive points +4.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
