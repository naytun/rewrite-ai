(3)</p><p>“Wait…”</p><p>However, before he could finish his sentence, half of the Reborn Lilies that covered the entire mountain turned white in an instant.</p><p>Black and white intertwined and formed an extreme balance between Yin and Yang. Lei Xi’er’s Holy Power gushed out and merged with the power of the God Devil Eyes.</p><p>“Ka!”</p><p>The Yuan Mansion split open, as spiderweb-like cracks appeared and spread throughout the Nine Heavens.</p><p>“Meow!” Greedy the Cat Spirit’s fur stood on end as it retreated to the back in fear.</p><p>“Holy Power? Are you serious?” Xu Xiaoshou was also frightened. “Why did you not stop? And you are even shamelessly using your Holy Power? The Yuan Mansion wouldn’t be able to withstand such an attack!”</p><p>However, Lei Xi’er did not stop.</p><p>Her aim was to defeat Xu Xiaoshou and this obsession had existed since Mu Zixi’s time.</p><p>If one were to trace the roots, it would have to go back to the semi-final stage of the Windcloud Competition in the Outer Yard of the Tiansang Spirit Palace. She had been thrown out of the Competition Platform by someone and had even been spat on…</p><p>Therefore, when Xu Xiaoshou took the initiative to fight, Lei Xi’er took it seriously and treated it as an opportunity to test her combat strength.</p><p>Thus, the ‘power of the gods and demons’ from the God Devil Eyes fused perfectly under the effect of the Holy Power. When the entire Yuan Mansion bloomed with the illusion of the translucent, black and white, two-colored Reborn Lilies…</p><p>The world in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes also underwent a change!</p><p>“Scourge from Heaven, Dao-breaking heart!”</p><p>A clear shout resounded from an unknown place.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that everything in the world had become an illusion and turned transparent. He felt as if he was in the clouds and he caught glimpses of the countless people he had met in his life.</p><p>There was Elder Sang, Bazhun’an, the Red Dog, Yu Lingdi, Double Dumba*s, the little girl… and a lot more. It was endless.</p><p>Even a passer-by in the mortal world, whom he had met by chance, also manifested in this world above the clouds.</p><p>Without exception…they laughed hideously and turned into illusory demons and flew into the clouds and formed a Calamity Cloud.</p><p>“A heart tribulation?” Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. He thought of the authority that had been taken away from the Lei family in the past – the power to control punishment!</p><p>Before he could ponder on this, the heart tribulation cloud that covered the entire world, that was as big as the Shengshen Continent, rumbled and thundered. Millions of illusory heart tribulations fell.</p><p>“I…” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were instantly filled with confusion. He was pulled into his own world by these heart tribulations and could not resist it.</p><p>After that, the cloud world glowed with a bright Holy Light.</p><p>Spirit Awakening!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou woke up in shock. He realized that if he had not been able to resist the thunder of the heart tribulation, he would probably have died on the spot, as long as Lei Xi’er didn’t stop.</p><p>“Freeze ability!” He subconsciously activated this new passive skill.</p><p>“Boom boom boom!”</p><p>In an instant, the thunder of thousands of the heart tribulations bombarded his mind, and the golden light emitted by Xu Xiaoshou’s body suddenly shattered.</p><p>It was as if countless steel balls had been forcibly stuffed into his mind. After these steel balls exploded, they turned into steel thorns that pierced in all directions and caused him so much pain that he wished he was dead.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face contorted in pain, but he could still hold on.</p><p>This was because the thunder of the heart tribulation, which had been weakened by his ‘immunity’, could no longer break through his spiritual body. He immediately summoned the Heart Sword Technique and stood at the top of the ancient building, and used the power of his imagery to suppress the thunder of the Heart Tribulation.</p><p>Only then did he feel as if the world had regained its clarity. Such a terrifying move had finally been blocked.</p><p>But…</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>On the other side, when Xu Xiaoshou’s ‘Freeze’ ability was smashed to pieces,Lei Xi ‘er’s delicate body trembled once again. With a pfft sound, she spewed out blood and her whole body was thrown up into the air.</p><p>This time, she completely lost her consciousness. She bled from all seven orifices and fell weakly from the sky.</p><p>It was inevitable that if that weak and defenseless body were to fall to the ground without the activation of the power of the Sacred Physique, it would really die on the spot and be shattered into pieces.</p><p>“What’s going on…”</p><p>Xu Xiashou was dumbfounded.</p><p>I haven’t even made a move, why did you fly away by yourself?</p><p>In a flash, he teleported toward Lei Xi’er and grabbed hold of her. Only then did the battle end, and he landed on the ground with her.</p><p>“Her spirit suffered a terrifying attack. She lost all consciousness and fainted…”</p><p>With just a glance, Xu Xiaoshou could see that Lei Xi’er’s injuries were very serious and she was on the verge of death. If it had not been for the self-defense power of the God Devil Eyes, she would probably have been brain dead by now.</p><p>He was instantly stunned and his eyes were filled with endless regret. He wished he could delete this ‘Freeze’ ability!</p><p>He hurriedly plucked a Holy Medicine, the ‘Flower of Life’, and fed it to Lei Xi’er. Only then did he realize that the frightful Awakening skill he had just obtained was even more terrifying than he had imagined!</p><p>“All physical, spiritual, and even spiritual attacks under the Demi-Saint realm would be nullified after I consume the Spiritual Source.”</p><p>“But once there’s a damage that even the ‘Freeze’ ability is not immune to, as long as the golden light is blown to pieces, the caster will also suffer the same damage as me?”</p><p>“I have passive skills, but she doesn’t!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared nervously at the limp and weak person in his arms.</p><p>After being fed the Holy Medicine, her breathing stabilized quickly, but Xu Xiaoshou was still filled with regret.</p><p>“D*mn it, if I knew this would be the outcome, I would have gone out directly and tested my new move with Master Siren!”</p><p>“Little Junior Sister, you can’t die…”</p><p>As he prayed silently, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt a strange transformation take place in the person in his arms.</p><p>It was an extremely overwhelming strange feeling indeed!</p><p>“Something’s wrong!”</p><p>“Little Junior Sister… No, Lei Xi’er, you seemed to have shrunk?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
