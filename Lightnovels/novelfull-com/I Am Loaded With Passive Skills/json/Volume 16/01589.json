(2)</p><p>He had activated Acalanatha, which was purely a means of self-protection.</p><p>However, he found that the torrent of decay that surged into his body did not hurt him at all. It only followed the connection of his body…</p><p>It flowed from his head to his feet like a stream of water.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou followed his ‘Perception’ path downward and was startled to find that the torrent of decay had merged into his shadow through the soles of his feet!</p><p>The sunlight shone down unobstructed on the wilderness of this strange world. The green grass swayed with the wind, and the faint shadows of the grass swayed along constantly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked to see that there was something very wrong with the short shadow under his feet!</p><p>A black shadow stood on his shoulder like a triangle without its obvious edges and corners.</p><p>However, when he used his ‘Perception’ to check, there was nothing on his shoulder!</p><p>The sunlight cast his shadow on the wilderness of time and space, but it also projected something that should not exist on his shoulder.</p><p>What kind of horrifying thing was this?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a chill run down his spine!</p><p>He didn’t even need to be reminded, as he immediately realized what the hell this was.</p><p>This was the ‘three-legged black owl’ that was on the shoulder of the Dark Division Chief, Ye Xiao, that could never be detected in the dark and gloomy First Hall of Sins. Even though he had combed through his entire body, he could not find a single trace of it!</p><p>The so-called ‘Stunned’ was from this!</p><p>It was Ye Xiao’s secret method to keep an eye on Chen Tan and Chen Ruye without being detected by Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>When the torrent of decay unceremoniously poured into the triangular black shadow on Xu Xiaoshou’s shadow, a shriek rang out.</p><p>At the same time, the sky in this spacetime darkened completely.</p><p>“Wuwuwu…”</p><p>The gloomy and cold cries of ghosts resounded from all directions.</p><p>The gate that connected the netherworld and the world of the living seemed to have been opened, and the earth turned black.</p><p>There were muscular giant spirit souls, skinny giant dragons with white bones who held on to boiling cauldrons and scampered about; there were countless imps held in their third and fourth arms as the King of the Hungry ghost tried to devour them.</p><p>“Wuuu!”</p><p>The cold screams pierced through one’s bones and Xu Xiaoshou had goosebumps all over his body.</p><p>This time, Ye Xiao no longer reined in her control. She was no longer afraid that her ability would affect the unknown in the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes and stimulate any unexpected danger.</p><p>Because this was no longer the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes!</p><p>“Pa pa pa…”</p><p>Hordes of three-legged black owls descended from the sky, devoured the hundreds of ghosts on the ground and finally merged into a Necromancer that towered into the sky.</p><p>On the shoulder of this Necromancer whose muscles bulged so much that his clothes seemed about to rip apart was a figure hidden within a black cloak.</p><p>On the shoulder of this black shadow was the three-legged Black Owl that had hidden itself on Xu Xiaoshou’s shoulder.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>The black owl shrieked.</p><p>The Dark Division Chief, Ye Xiao, tilted her head and looked at the two figures under her feet who should not have cooperated with each other. After a long silence, she said in a low voice.</p><p>“I don’t understand.”</p><p>I don’t understand either!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded.</p><p>What the hell was this Five Decays of Heaven and Man? How could he even see the greatest danger that he had accidentally discovered?</p><p>More importantly, why did he help me?</p><p>Why did he force Ye Xiao out to have a showdown with her here?</p><p>Or perhaps, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was not sure if he could kill me on his own, so he called out Ye Xiao to sought her help to kill me?</p><p>“Miss Ye Xiao?” Xu Xiaoshou suppressed his turbulent thoughts and addressed her. The disbelief and incomprehension in his eyes were evident. “You, why are you here?”</p><p>Ye Xiao was her usual calm self, like when she was in the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes, when she watched him search an entire day for a non-existent passage. “Chen Tan, you have one more chance.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fell silent.</p><p>Of course, he understood what this so-called one chance was.</p><p>That was to hand over the ‘God Execution Order’ and follow Ye Xiao back obediently. After their return to the Holy Divine Palace, he would join one of the six divisions, then contribute the ‘Power of the Evil God’ and explain how he obtained this ability. In the end, his fate would still be unknown, and it would be entirely up to the Holy Divine Palace to decide.</p><p>Well, it was like Gou Wuyue.</p><p>Who would not know what the outcome would be?</p><p>“Chen…Tan…?”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man laughed in a strange manner, but he didn’t care. He looked at the silent young man next to him and said.</p><p>“Chen Ruye, I can tell you the result of our cooperation. The final-stage was a complete success.”</p><p>“And now, I need to know why you’ve come to the First Hall of Sins on behalf of the Xu Yue Grey Palace?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and did not say anything.</p><p>Even though he had always prided himself on being smart, his brain was still a little muddled at this moment.</p><p>What did that mean?</p><p>So just now, when you told me about those things, you were not out to tempt me, and it was really true?</p><p>Was the palace master of Xu Yue Grey Palace really called Sha Shengluo?</p><p>No matter what, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t go with Ye Xiao.</p><p>The standpoint was very clear cut. The Five Decays of Heaven and Man showed goodwill, even if he didn’t know the reason why. Maybe it was just to go against the Xu Yue Grey Palace…</p><p>But it was enough!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t think that such a casual fabricated identity could be related to a member of Yama whom he had never met before.</p><p>But now, he had no choice but to believe that there was indeed something called ‘Coincidence’ in this world.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
