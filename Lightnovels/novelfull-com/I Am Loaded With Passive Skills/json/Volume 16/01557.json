This Demi-Saint really handed over his right of free movement to one of his minions to make a decision? Did he not want to preserve his image?”</p><p>“This is a rather difficult situation…”</p><p>What Xu Xiaoshou feared most were brainy people and he didn’t know how to make a decision.</p><p>As long as Elder Han did not give up and he felt that he harbored some ill intentions, he would seal him without a second thought.</p><p>However, the other party was so sincere that it could be said that he had placed his life in his hands. This made him feel a little uncomfortable.</p><p>“Not like a mortal!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed in his heart and immediately used the Spirit Threads to weave an array and paste the seal on the cell door.</p><p>Ka!</p><p>The ice wings on the outside lost their connection with their owner, and the Demi-Saint’s aura on them disappeared. They turned into broken ice cubes, dropped and finally melted into a pool of water that was full of spiritual energy.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at it casually and was about to purify the water.</p><p>Who would have thought that Ye Xiao would be faster than him? With a cold glance, the Necromancer swung his staff, and a deathly light silently absorbed the pool of water instantly. Xu Xiaoshou was so scared that he almost poked a hole in the seal of the cell door.</p><p>“D*mn it, they’re even more cautious than me. These two are not easy to deal with!” Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was in his throat again, and he didn’t dare to relax his guard at all.</p><p>“Chen Tan.” After Ye Xiao cleaned everything up, she looked at him coldly and raised her hands. “I won’t attack you anymore. Give me the God Execution Order and I’ll write off everything that happened here.”</p><p>She wanted the God Execution Order again?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused. “I’ve said it before, right? You and I worked together to explore the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes. What an individual gets is his own, and what a team gets is divided equally. Why are you so obsessed about what I’ve gotten?”</p><p>“You shouldn’t have taken the God Execution Order. It will only bring you disaster.” Ye Xiao shook her head as she said this.</p><p>“So what is it exactly?” Xu Xiaoshou had already hidden the God Execution Order well, and he was still as adamant as before when he replied. In fact, he knew that the more Ye Xiao valued it, the more he couldn’t give it to her.</p><p>This was already a matter of principle. It had nothing to do with the extended meaning of the God Execution Order. It was just that Ye Xiao would never understand that.</p><p>Ye Xiao was silent and once again, she had nothing to say.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was about to poke a hole in the cell door and ask Elder Han about the origin of the God Execution Order. The Demi-Saint felt that the token was very powerful and he did not know the origins of the God Execution Order.</p><p>When she saw this, Ye Xiao spoke again. “I will retreat for now. You can take the God Execution Order and I’ll give you a credit. You can follow me back to the Holy Divine Palace. As long as you pass the background test, you can also exchange your credit for cultivation resources.”</p><p>What?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>“You mean, you want me to join the Dark Division? Your Dark Division?”</p><p>“You can take it as that. Think about it, I can recommend you to the Path Division or the Transformation Division.”</p><p>In terms of spiritual arrays, Chen Tan was qualified to join the Path Division.</p><p>In terms of the Power of the Evil God, the Transformation Division could help him to research this spell technique, and both sides would get what they needed.</p><p>In terms of intelligence, technique, and strategy, this guy would have a bright future after he joined the Dark Division…</p><p>No matter which option he took, Ye Xiao believed that she had given Chen Tan the best options in life. She had helped a random cultivator from the Southern Region to join the number one organization on the continent, get to work with her and cultivate his skills. She did not believe that Chen Tan would not be tempted.</p><p>“I’m going to f *cking die!” Xu Xiaoshou cursed in his heart.</p><p>It was impossible for him to pass the background test, so how could he join the Holy Divine Palace? Why were Ye Xiao and Night Guardian so alike?</p><p>“I’m used to an idle and carefree life. I don’t want to go.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou brushed off her offer. He didn’t even bother to think about the possibility of betrayal if he pretended to agree.</p><p>After all, this meant that he would have to stay with Ye Xiao. The more he stayed, the more mistakes he would make, and the greater the risk of exposure would be.</p><p>Only a person with a sick mentality would casually join such a large organization. This meant that he would reveal himself to everyone, and unknown problems would soon follow suit.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had rejected Yama for the same reason.</p><p>Ye Xiao was silent. She didn’t expect that the olive branch she extended would be rejected so harshly. This was something she had never thought of. It was the first time she wanted someone so badly.</p><p>“You can…”</p><p>“I don’t need to think about it anymore.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and interrupted her. He lifted his head and grinned. A fierce light flashed in his eyes as he said.</p><p>“I’m not afraid to tell you, Miss Ye Xiao, the Qinjing court was destroyed after the old man taught me and he was almost like my father.”</p><p>“I was really tired of all those noisy voices. I still had a mission to complete and I don’t want to be anyone’s puppet.”</p><p>“This isn’t…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou spread out his hands and laughed teasingly. His eyes were filled with good memories as he sighed.</p><p>“The old man’s body is now buried under Mount Dafan. If Miss Ye Xiao is interested, you can go and search for him…Well, as long as he still has a bit of spiritual quality left.”</p><p>His words were calm, and his posture was also very indifferent, but it gave people a feeling of distaste.</p><p>This was the first time Ye Xiao had experienced the urge when she wanted someone so badly but she also wanted to kill him instantly in the next minute!</p><p>She was also cold-blooded, but she would never be as heartless as Chen Tan. If you listened to what he said…This was a bastard who deceived his master and destroyed his ancestors!</p><p>“Southern Region’s evil cultivator…” Ye Xiao murmured, and her eyes that were hidden in the shadows became even colder.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
