If another accident were to happen, Jiang Buyi’s heart would not be able to bear it!</p><p>The cawing of crows came suddenly, without any warning.</p><p>After he calmed the Taboo Puppet down, Jiang Buyi scanned the entire Zhen Huang Palace again. However, he still could not find the presence of any crows.</p><p>The giant statue suddenly moved.</p><p>A golden drop of water floated in front of it, and a blurry picture appeared inside.</p><p>It was a black crow that tried desperately to escape. Its shape was unclear, but perhaps it was a native creature of the First Hall of Sins like the Taboo Puppet?</p><p>Jiang Buyi had this thought due to what the giant statue said after the golden water drop appeared.</p><p>“Bring it… bring… The reward… The Void… Crystal…”</p><p>Reward?</p><p>Mission?</p><p>Jiang Buyi knew that the Void Attendant on the Abyss Island would occasionally issue missions.</p><p>“Alright.” he said.</p><p>He nodded and took the golden water droplet. He took note of the form of the crow inside, then he suddenly turned around and left Zhen Huang Palace with the Taboo Puppet.</p><p>There wasn’t much time left on the exemption order.</p><p>If this native of the First Hall of Sins could be exchanged for 50 Void Crystals, every second counted.</p><p>Because from the scene, the crow was obviously in danger and was on the run.</p><p>Even after Jiang Buyi left Zhen Huang Palace with the Taboo Puppet and the great array was sealed, the giant statue’s staccato voice did not stop.</p><p>Its gravelly voice echoed for some time, as if it had just identified the number of Abyss Island Sinners when the mission was issued.</p><p>Then, after careful consideration, it gave the number of rewards that could be obtained after the mission was completed.</p><p>“Two …”</p><p>The wilderness space-time created by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man collapsed after the disappearance of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou had just returned to the familiar labyrinth of the First Hall of Sins. Suddenly he heard a crow’s caw in the distance.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s hair stood on end, and his body seemed to have left together with his soul, and he appeared taller.</p><p>“She’s not dead!”</p><p>Not far from the labyrinth’s passage, the orange-masked Five Decays of Heaven and Man still held the golden talisman. The battle he had just experienced seemed just like a dream.</p><p>He retracted his hand and glanced at the broken pieces of the golden talisman. The broken pieces turned into an aura of decay and disappeared.</p><p>After he did this, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man finally looked up. “She’s already dead.”</p><p>“You must be deaf… Cough! Cough!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou restrained his rage and became docile. He tilted his head and asked ,”Senior, didn’t you hear the cry just now? That was Ye Xiao. She’s not dead yet.”</p><p>As he followed the trail of the three-legged owl’s shadow, a spiritual light flashed through his mind, and he began to connect the dots.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had a very bold and mysterious illusion. It was very close to reality-the possibility of why Ye Xiao could still be alive!</p><p>“Senior, did you notice that whenever Ye Xiao appears, she always has a three-legged black owl on her shoulder?”</p><p>“Your killing curse is so powerful. If it was a normal higher void… No, if a Demi-Saint were to appear, they might be gone by now.”</p><p>“With such a large amount of Qi of decay, how could she still be alive?”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was indifferent and didn’t want to talk at all. He said, “You don’t have to think too much. Once the space-time golden talisman appeared, everything you do will be tracked and seen by others. So, you can’t make any more moves.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly slapped his thigh, his thoughts clearly not on the same channel as the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. He said to himself.</p><p>“You said that she didn’t cultivate the Immortal Body. If it had been the Body of Death, she would have been killed by you!”</p><p>“But she’s still alive… That would mean that the Ye Xiao we killed might not be the Dark Division Chief, Ye Xiao, but her puppet.”</p><p>“Ye Xiao’s original form is that three-legged black owl??? ”</p><p>This idea was simply ingenious and Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had found the right direction.</p><p>If he was the Dark Division Chief, he would do the same thing. He would create an attractive body on the surface and direct all the danger to this body.</p><p>By the time the battle was over and the enemy finally reacted, all his means would have been used on the puppet’s body and everything would be stripped clean.</p><p>At that time, the one who would be damned would be that guy who was targeted by the true body of the God of Death.</p><p>Ye Xiao was not dead, she merely chose to escape at this moment…</p><p>This was purely because the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was too disgusting!</p><p>Even a Demi-Saint would not want to fight with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. This guy’s ability was simply too disgusting and difficult to deal with!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could almost imagine what would happen if he had faced Ye Xiao on his own after he exposed all his abilities and risked his life to kill Ye Xiao’s body.</p><p>When the three-legged black owl finally revealed her true form after she comprehended all of his abilities, what would happen to him?</p><p>Cold sweat trickled down Xu Xiaoshou’s body, and his lips turned pale.</p><p>Ye Xiao was too sinister!</p><p>The more sinister this Dark Division Chief was, the more Xu Xiaoshou was determined not to let her live.</p><p>He turned to look at the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. He wanted to attack together with him and stop the three-legged black owl, that was the Ye Xiao’s actual body.</p><p>In the end, he found that even after he said all these, the expression of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man did not change at all.</p><p>“You were aware of this?” Xu Xiaoshou was so shocked that he sweated profusely. “You knew all this?”</p><p>“You don’t need to know.” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was very calm.</p><p>“How can I not know? I was that fellow’s target. As long as she doesn’t die, maybe one day, I will…”</p><p>“I said, you don’t need to do anything.”</p><p>The voice of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was so calm and indifferent.</p><p>He stared intently at Chen Ruye in front of him, then turned around and looked up at the black shadow that had disappeared into the sky. His body turned into a mist of decay and disappeared.</p><p>“I will take action.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
