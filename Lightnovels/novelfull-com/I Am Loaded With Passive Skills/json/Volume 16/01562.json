He fell heavily to the ground and was very shocked.</p><p>“+(Startled, Passive Points,+)+1.”</p><p>The spatial dislocation in the First Hall of Sins lasted only for an instant.</p><p>After he missed the opportunity to escape from the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes, the spatial passageway that had cut across the void disappeared, as if no Transformation had ever taken place.</p><p>However, it was clear that everything had changed.</p><p>The spatial passageway had disappeared, but the person who walked out of it remained!</p><p>She hovered in the air!</p><p>She was wearing a white off-shoulder dress, and there were only two straps on her beautiful back. The two sunken dips at her waist could be seen and her bare feet stepped gently on the spiritual energy. She looked slender and graceful.</p><p>In her hand was a three-feet-long, green-and-white sword. The long sword had no scabbard, and the Sword Body had Dragons and Phoenixes carved on it. The sword was surrounded by auspicious clouds. The woman’s temperament seemed refined and untainted by the mortal world.</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart sank.</p><p>He had been waiting to seize the opportunity during the First Hall of Sins’s spatial disorder.</p><p>However, he had never thought that he would also be accompanied by the Ruler of the red-clothed people, the Seven Sword Deity, Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>“This motherf*cker…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nearly went crazy.</p><p>He had thought that even if someone was sent over this time, perhaps it would randomly be Master Siren.</p><p>Then, he wouldn’t even need to run. He could directly crush Ye Xiao and kill her on the spot!</p><p>But…</p><p>“What am I betting on?”</p><p>On second thought, there were only a few people from his side on the Abyss Island.</p><p>The remaining people were either the elites of the Holy Divine Palace, the higher void level of the red-clothed and white-clothed people, or the members of the third party factions or assassins who had come for his head.</p><p>If someone really came, there was a high chance that it would not end well.</p><p>“I am Chen Tan, greetings to Sword Deity Rao!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to think too much. Using Chen Tan’s identity, he quickly cupped his fists in greeting and with a Swish returned to the door of the Tian San cell without waiting for a reply. He seemed to have found a sense of security.</p><p>Run?</p><p>The spatial passageway had already disappeared, so how could he escape?</p><p>He had rushed into the passage just now when he saw that he had a chance to escape.</p><p>However, the moment he stepped in and saw Rao Yaoyao’s face, not only was he scared, but the sense of fear at the sight of a Saint’s face made Xu Xiaoshou subconsciously choose to retreat instead of taking the easy way out and pass by Rao Yaoyao in order to escape.</p><p>Yes, the feeling that Rao Yaoyao gave people… was a huge change!</p><p>She was no longer like what she was in the Dongtianwang City when she was angry about the comparison between the Cang Godhood Sword and the Fourth Sword’s superiority. She was also no longer the same person she was on the Lone Cliff, where she was afraid and fearful due to the appearance of Yama Huang Quan.</p><p>When their eyes met, Xu Xiaoshou felt a special aura from Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>It was similar to the Holy Realm of the Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi!</p><p>Furthermore, it was a very different feeling…</p><p>How should he describe it?</p><p>Untainted by the mortal world?</p><p>Too indifferent or senseless?</p><p>All in all, his instincts told him that he should not get too close!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw the coldness and sharpness that remained in Rao Yaoyao’s eyes. She no longer had the hesitancy and indecisiveness from before.</p><p>He didn’t dare to take the risk, so he chose to retreat and not cross over.</p><p>“Ye Xiao…”</p><p>Suspended in mid-air, Rao Yaoyao couldn’t even be bothered to look at that cowardly rat. She turned to look at her Dark Division Chief. “I sensed your aura, so I came over.”</p><p>The various traces of battle, the remnants of the power of the God of Death and the auras left behind by many other special powers told Rao Yaoyao what had taken place here.</p><p>However, the unknown guy did not choose to break out of the encirclement by force, and she was too lazy to make a move. She only used her momentum to force him back.</p><p>Before she understood everything, even a mosquito would not be able to fly out when she was here!</p><p>“Chen Tan, an evil cultivator from the Southern Region. He has the power of the Evil God, the Phantom Swords Technique, and was a Spirit Array Caster. His realm is unknown, but he is extremely intelligent. He has the ‘God Execution Order’.”</p><p>Ye Xiao emotionlessly shared her knowledge and judgment. After she said that, her gaze fell on Chen Tan’s back, and she spoke again.</p><p>“The only prisoner in the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes, Elder Han, Demi-Saint, ice-type, Temple of Hatred, suspected to be a Ghost Beast.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>She rarely heard Ye Xiao speak so much at one time.</p><p>This wasn’t even a ”sentence’, but just ‘words’. Only Rao Yaoyao was used to it and could extract effective information from it.</p><p>The last time she had received so many words from Ye Xiao was when she analyzed the Ultimate Life Demon Physique in the Yunlun Mountain Range.</p><p>The follow-up plans could not keep up with the Transformation and were all disrupted by accidents.</p><p>However, without exception, every time Ye Xiao opened her mouth, the situation would definitely not be good. She was like a mourning bird that only reported about deaths.</p><p>This wasn’t…</p><p>“Too much demonic wisdom?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao looked at Chen Tan. It was hard to imagine that Ye Xiao gave such a totally positive evaluation of humans.</p><p>This caused all the information about Chen Tan to become insignificant in the face of the word ‘too much demonic wisdom’.</p><p>How wise was he?</p><p>Almost on par with Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>“Ancient Swordsman?” Rao Yaoyao’s cold eyes swept over and fixed on the man who stood at the entrance of the side hall, trembling with fear.</p><p>“Yes.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded as he pretended to be neither humble nor arrogant.</p><p>“The Southern Region…Who is your master? The Feng family?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“You only know the Phantom Swords Technique?”</p><p>“I know a little.” Xu Xiaoshou answered tactfully and did not give a direct response.</p><p>Who knew that Rao Yaoyao’s expression would suddenly turn cold? She raised the Cang Goodhood Sword in her hand and her entire being was filled with killing intent. “The Feng family of the Southern Region only cultivated the Ten Thousand Sword Technique. Who are you trying to fool?”</p><p>“+(Startled, Passive Points,+)+1.”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou almost used his Transformation to simulate and control his own heartbeat so it would not stop suddenly and show the chaotic state he was in to the others.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
