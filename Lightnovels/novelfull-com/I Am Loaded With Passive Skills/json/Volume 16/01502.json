He muttered to himself,</p><p>“I’ve been studying this thing all the way and finally found out some of its abilities. Fortunately, I didn’t encounter any other danger or fight along the way. Now, I can verify my conjecture, hehe!</p><p>“Logically speaking, the First Hall of Sins has the ability to reset the death countdown. With so many battles taking place in Sky City, there should be many people who want to enter this place like me.</p><p>“Let’s take a look at who has been here before!”</p><p>Reverend Huang Yang’s eyes glowed with a red light, full of expectation.</p><p>With a hand seal, he mobilized the spiritual source in his body and injected it into the Blood Pearl.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>With a flash of red light, Reverend Huang Yang felt his connection with the Blood Pearl deepen.</p><p>Every time he used the Blood Pearl and injected a spiritual source into it, he could feel the bond between the two deepen.</p><p>Perhaps, this was another form of blood ownership?</p><p>His energy reserve and spiritual source began to fall rapidly.</p><p>It was not until Reverend Huang Yang’s face turned pale, as if his whole body had been sucked dry, that the suction force from the Blood Pearl disappeared. His eyes also turned scarlet.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>His vision blurred, and a hazy blood-red world appeared. The scene in front of the First Hall of Sins had also changed slightly.</p><p>…</p><p>“Thud, thud, thud.”</p><p>The footsteps stopped at the entrance of the hall.</p><p>A young man in a brand-new white robe glanced at the person beside him and said,</p><p>“I know what you want to say, but unlike the other nine extreme grounds, the ultimate attribute of the First Hall of Sins is the easiest to activate.</p><p>“There’s no need for a demi-saint to enter. Any Sovereign Dao Realm expert would be able to recover the power inside.</p><p>“Therefore, if we wait for the demi-saints from the headquarters to come to Abyss Island and ask them to enter the First Hall of Sins, what they will face will be even more terrible. It might not even be as easy as shutting down Abyss Island directly after we enter it.</p><p>“At least, if you and I work together, we can almost overcome the entire Abyss Island beneath the demi-saint level, can’t we?”</p><p>The blurry figure of a youth was reflected in the blood-red world. Reverend Huang Yang recognized him with a glance. It was the already dead Spirit Division Chief, Yu Lingdi!</p><p>“He’s still alive?”</p><p>Reverend Huang Yang was shocked.</p><p>Shutting down Abyss Island, the nine extreme grounds, the arrival of the demi-saint, and the activation of the ultimate attribute.</p><p>He had used the power of the Blood Pearl to travel back in time and had eavesdropped on and seen all these daunting contents.</p><p>“The Blood Pearl is indeed a supreme treasure!”</p><p>Reverend Huang Yang was overjoyed. Since it involved The Power of Space-Time, there was no doubt that it was a supreme treasure.</p><p>He didn’t dare to think too much, and hurriedly looked at the person beside Yu Lingdi. He couldn’t recognize who that person was at all, and even the Blood Pearl only reflected a black color, as if it was an existence hidden in the shadows.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>This dark man, who had a huge skeleton and was wearing a black feather coat, did not even say a word. The three-legged black owl on his shoulder opened its mouth and called out, and everything was over.</p><p>The next scene was Yu Lingdi pushing open the door and entering. The fellow wearing the black feather clothes blended into the black shadow and followed.</p><p>The scene ended.</p><p>“That’s it?” Reverend Huang Yang was stunned.</p><p>Who was this? Yu Lingdi was talking to him, and he didn’t even feel the need to reply. Wasn’t this attitude a little too much?</p><p>“He should also be a big shot…”</p><p>After making a simple judgment, Reverend Huang Yang once again stared at the blurry image transmitted by the Blood Pearl, because at this time, the scene changed and another figure came out.</p><p>…</p><p>“Thud.”</p><p>The footsteps stopped.</p><p>A man in an orange robe and an orange mask stopped at the spot where Reverend Huang Yang was.</p><p>He laughed strangely and looked back at the distance behind him. “You’re a demi-saint, after all. You don’t have to stay so far away. Are you waiting for an opportunity to run away?”</p><p>A demi-saint?</p><p>Reverend Huang Yang’s eyes immediately widened.</p><p>What’s going on? This orange-masked man had a demi-saint following him?</p><p>Then what was with his tone?</p><p>Who dared to speak to a demi-saint like this?</p><p>Was he also a demi-saint? And the one behind him was being controlled by him?</p><p>Any normal demi-saint would not be able to tolerate the orange-masked man’s blasphemy, right?</p><p>As he was thinking about this, the image shown by the Blood Pearl had already enlarged.</p><p>Reverend Huang Yang easily spotted the demi-saint who was hanging far behind the orange-masked man. His entire body was covered with illusory squares, and even the color of his clothes could not be distinguished.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The corners of his mouth immediately twitched. He wanted to comfort him, but he felt very helpless.</p><p>“The Blood Pearl is really a treasure. You even considered that my current cultivation is not enough to meet the Saint. You are really too considerate!”</p><p>“But I can’t see anything clearly like this. Is there no way to see the demi-saint without triggering the danger of meeting the Saint?”</p><p>Reverend Huang Yang had just started to mumble when he suddenly felt a crazy suction force coming from the Blood Pearl.</p><p>However, his energy reserve had not even recovered half of its spiritual source. With this one tug, his energy reserve was emptied. Reverend Huang Yang felt that his life force was starting to fade away. The figure and face of the demi-saint on the screen started to become clear.</p><p>“Enough! That’s enough!”</p><p>“If you continue, I’m going to die!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
