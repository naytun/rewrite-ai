It’s too big!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong turned around, but he did not retract his sword. Instead, he sent out a wisp of his spiritual senses in response.</p><p>“The interior of the First Hall of Sins is a little bigger than I thought. I’ve used the Ten Thousand Sword Technique to do a rapid search and calculated all the possible results, but I still haven’t found a regular answer.”</p><p>“After all, this is the most difficult way to solve the problem.” Xu Xiaoshou muttered.</p><p>Since he was the Eldest Senior Brother of the Fringe Moon Immortal City, there was no need to doubt Xiao Kongtong’s strength.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou estimated that in the duration of half an hour, Xiao Kongtong had probably used his small Void Stilettos to explore an area that was almost half the size of the Forest of Miracles.</p><p>However, there had been no results so far. Did this mean that there was a possibility that there would not be any results in the future?</p><p>“What if the labyrinth was just a cover to mislead people to figure out how to solve the mystery and then they realize that the labyrinth and the main Hall are not connected?” Xu Xiaoshou touched his chin.</p><p>“We can’t rule out that possibility.” Mei Siren nodded as he tapped his paper fan. “Perhaps it’s easier to crack it with brute force than with ingenuity…Yes, I mean, to solve the problem.”</p><p>“Brute force?” Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>“If Eldest Brother’s ‘Immortal guides the way’ could be considered as skillful, then what would his true barbaric behavior be like?”</p><p>“If I destroy this Hall with one strike, I might be able to trigger a reaction and find the way to the main Hall.” Mei Siren said with a serious expression.</p><p>“…” Xu Xiaoshou and Mu Zixi immediately fell silent.</p><p>“No.” Xiao Kongtong shook his head. “I saw a large number of Void Attendants in the Hall. There were almost no less than six or seven hundred of them. If I attack, I will only provoke them and waste a lot of time. After all, a change in quantity will lead to a change in quality…</p><p>“Mmm, other than that, I’ve also discovered something strange.”</p><p>“Oh?” The three of them looked over.</p><p>“Didn’t you notice? The Ultimate Attribute in the First Hall of Sins has been activated, and the power in our bodies is flowing out at an extremely slow rate. However, the speed of this loss of power is not equal, and it seems to be multiplying with each passing moment.” Xiao Kongtong’s expression was grave.</p><p>They then started to observe themselves.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was the first to discover that his Eternal Vitality ran quietly and slowly.</p><p>However, the circulation speed had increased little by little, which meant that the loss of the life force in his body had also accelerated.</p><p>Perhaps the initial speed wasn’t that rapid, but the acceleration was excessive!</p><p>According to the development of this situation…</p><p>In less than two hours, the ‘Eternal Vitality’, ‘High Spirits’ and ‘Transformation’ had all been activated to resist the loss of his Life Force.</p><p>In less than half a day, the confrontation between the ‘exit’ and ‘entry’ might be at a stalemate.</p><p>In less than a day, he would have to take medicine to save his life!</p><p>“It’s even more exaggerated than the draining power of the water ball when I faced Water Ghost in the Deep Sea…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his scalp tingle. This kind of initial weak nibbling was the least noticeable, but if he really didn’t pay attention, by the time he found that something was amiss, he might already be finished.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong swept his gaze over the group. After he saw that they were all on the alert, he continued.</p><p>“I also saw a few corpses in the labyrinth. A small number of them didn’t look like humans, so they were obviously attacked by the Void Attendant.”</p><p>“Most of the bodies were still intact, but their Life force were completely gone. They had been sucked dry.”</p><p>“I think they must have landed in the First Hall of Sins from the very beginning. After they encountered the Void Attendant, they tried to control their movements and proceed according to the situation. After that, they were unable to move anymore.”</p><p>Mu Zixi was so frightened that she took out an Elixir that looked like a jelly bean and popped it into her mouth to replenish her Life force. She mumbled, “Does this mean we don’t have much time left?” She was also an Elixir Master.</p><p>“Not much, not little either. At most three days, if no one tried to delay it.” Xiao Kongtong swept his gaze over the group and gave a more accurate assessment. After all, this group of people were not merely ordinary people.</p><p>Delay?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes flickered when he caught this word.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong looked over with a smile, paused, and said, “I found two people, the Demi-Saint of the Jiang clan and Yama’s orange-faced Five Decays of Heaven and Hell. They are on their way toward us, in the opposite direction of the void stilettos… I’ve already destroyed the void stilettos around that place.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced quickly at his Junior Sister as his heart raced. That old thing appeared again?</p><p>As for the Five Decays of Heaven and Man…Who on earth was that?</p><p>“Can you look for an entry point?” Mei Siren asked the key question. He did not care who came and who went. He only cared about whether the ultimate goal of this trip could be achieved.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong shook his head.</p><p>It was the same road with no end in sight…</p><p>The labyrinth was so huge that he couldn’t give a definite answer.</p><p>“Perhaps, Teacher’s suggestion earlier would be a good choice.” Xu Xiaoshou glanced at Master Siren. He suddenly felt that if he tore apart the Great Hall with his sword, that in turn would release the unknown, would be the best way to solve the problem.</p><p>Difficult?</p><p>Then don’t do anything!</p><p>At this moment, the entire First Hall of Sins exploded with a loud bang and began to shake.</p><p>The wall split apart, and smooth cracks appeared on it.</p><p>The space became distorted and the figures were displaced. It was as if all the rules had been messed up and reset after the loud noise.</p><p>“What’s going on?” Mu Zixi couldn’t help but edge closer to her Senior Brother; she felt a little panicky about the unknown changes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
