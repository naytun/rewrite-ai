I hope that Sword Deity Rao would not be distracted.”</p><p>“We’re on the same side now, and I’ve already submitted my voting certificate. You all know what Elder Han’s plan was, he definitely won’t let me off.”</p><p>“If his Possession really succeeded, the Holy Divine Palace would be disgraced!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face was pale, and his heart thumped rapidly. Blood spurted out of his mouth as if he was at the end of his tether. He sat down cross-legged and closed his eyes to rest, and did not speak anymore.</p><p>Ye Xiao was also stunned.</p><p>She did not expect that the evil cultivator of the Southern Region also cultivated Buddhist techniques. The ‘Hand of Great Mercy’ and the golden light that suddenly disappeared…</p><p>Why was the feeling so familiar?</p><p>However, before she could think about it, Elder Han, who had been hurled back to the Tian San cell, suddenly roared.</p><p>“Chen! Tan!”</p><p>“+(Called, Passive Points,+)+1.”</p><p>When the strange purple evil energy separated and the frosty white air descended again, Elder Han, who walked out of the cell had reverted to his human form.</p><p>His fair face was covered in black demonic patterns, and his eyes were filled with Violet Qi that made him look extremely evil.</p><p>What was most shocking was that the clothes on Elder Han’s chest had been completely ripped apart. A purple eyeball the size of a human head was embedded in his chest. It dripped with blood and overflowed with evil energy.</p><p>“He’s been hit!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao and Ye Xiao turned around and their expressions were serious.</p><p>No one had thought that Elder Han would fall into this trap. He had definitely underestimated Chen Tan. He had never thought that anyone below the Demi-Saint level would be able to instantly break the ice seal of the Demi-Saint Stage. As a result, the Cursed Yin Eye was embedded in his body.</p><p>“The Hand of Great Mercy…”</p><p>“What kind of ‘Hand of Great Mercy’ is this, Chen Tan…”</p><p>Elder Han was furious. He looked down at the eyeball in his chest and sauntered out. Even he couldn’t deal with this Cursed Yin Eye for the moment, so he could only seal it in ice.</p><p>Ye Xiao was scared when she saw this.</p><p>She had been hit by Chen Tan’s attack before.</p><p>She had been cautious at that time, so she removed the restrictions on her body in advance and split up the three-legged black owl to diffuse this move.</p><p>Who would’ve thought that even the Demi-Saint Elder Han would be helpless in the face of Chen Tan’s move!</p><p>In the distance, Xu Xiaoshou, who was resting with his eyes closed, heard the sound and peeped for a moment, then closed his eyes again. He pretended he was exhausted and continued to regulate his breath.</p><p>“Ruthless!”</p><p>“The Power of the Ancestral Source is not just an aura. It’s really ruthless. Even a Demi-Saint can’t resolve it in a short time!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered and finally understood why Jiang Buyi was so afraid of Teng Shanhai’s Power of Demon God.</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>With a head drenched in sweat and bloodshot eyes, Elder Han suddenly raised his head and laughed. He used his coldness to suppress his almost out of control emotions. His expression returned to normal and he was no longer affected by the Power of the Evil God.</p><p>“Little chap, I should not underestimate each and every one of you…”</p><p>He grabbed the Cursed Yin Eye that was embedded in his chest, as if he wanted to pull it out, but he also seemed to be worried.</p><p>Elder Han’s gaze swept past Chen Tan, glanced at Rao Yaoyao, and finally settled on Ye Xiao on the Necromancer’s shoulder. No one knew what he was thinking.</p><p>“Then come!”</p><p>Suddenly, Elder Han let out a loud roar and spread out his four limbs into a posture that was not human and flew up into the sky like a big cat.</p><p>The Nine Heavens suddenly turned icy cold.</p><p>The black Ghost Beast Aura gushed out from his body like a tide. It froze the void and turned the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes into a world of ice.</p><p>“Release!”</p><p>Elder Han shouted angrily toward the sky. His clothes exploded with a bang, and his body expanded.</p><p>It undid its original form and, in the form of a Ghost Beast, released the Cursed Yin Eye that had been embedded in its body and temporarily stopped the invasion of the Power of the Evil God.</p><p>Then, it turned into a creature that was over a hundred feet in size. Its body was slender, and its four limbs were short and small. Its entire body was covered in white hair, and it had a large and soft tail.</p><p>Even though he was in a furious state, Elder Han’s true form was still not quite ferocious. Compared to the Void Attendant, he could be considered as ‘small and cute’.</p><p>His cat-like face was still pure white. Apart from the black and cold ghostly energy, Elder Han’s entire body was black. Only his two huge eyes and a dozen soft whiskers were left.</p><p>“Frost Ferret!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was stunned for a moment and suddenly exclaimed.</p><p>On the shoulder of the Necromancer, Ye Xiao’s eyes that were hidden in the dark, looked up curiously.</p><p>Others didn’t know, but as the Ruler of the red-clothed people, who dealt with Ghost Beasts every day, how could Rao Yaoyao not know about this creature in front of her? She immediately explained.</p><p>“Frost Ferret, an ice-type Demi-Saint level Ghost Beast. Its origin is unknown, but hundreds of years ago, it was a beast that was hunted down by Elder Yan and Elder Yu.”</p><p>“At its peak, its combat strength was very strong. After it was captured, it was first sealed in the Infernal Hell Sea and could only be suppressed with the help of the extreme fire-type element.”</p><p>“After that, there was a change in the Infernal Hell Sea and it was transferred to the Four Symbols Secret Realm. Then, this fellow continued to cause trouble and was sent to the Inner Island of the Abyss Island. Only then did it become peaceful…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao spoke as if there was no one else around; it was as if she had completely forgotten that there was an outsider at the back of the battlefield.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked as if he was undergoing recuperation, with his eyes closed, but he had actually been paying attention to the battlefield with his ‘Perception’.When he heard what Rao Yaoyao said, he was shocked.</p><p>“Frost Ferret, Infernal Hell Sea?”</p><p>He already knew that the Infernal Hell Sea was one of the Seven Breaks and it was the predecessor of the White Cave.</p><p>So, Elder Han had once been sealed in the old White Cave, and was suppressed by the power of the Seven Breaks?</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought it was strange.</p><p>He thought of the Spirit Fusion Swamp and the Infernal Original Seed he had obtained there. He also thought of the final explosion where Ice and Fire intersected in that damned place.</p><p>In such a large fire-type extradimensional space, why was there only a Snow Mountain sealed by a spiritual array in the Spirit Fusion Swamp? Why was it forbidden to have a sacred object like the Three Days Frozen Calamity?</p><p>It can’t be?</p><p>The more Xu Xiaoshou thought about it, the more incredulous he felt.</p><p>What did this mean?</p><p>Could it be that the ice-type energy in the Spirit Fusion Swamp was formed due to Elder Han’s existence?</p><p>This fellow had even been sealed in the Four Symbols Secret Realm before. Could the trouble it had caused be the Ran Ming ruins it had mentioned?</p><p>In the end, he was even sent to the Inner Island of the Abyss Island…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyelashes suddenly trembled, and he almost couldn’t open his eyes to look.</p><p>Wasn’t the Inner Island of the Abyss Island the home of Bazhun’an?</p><p>There, the black and white lineages were respected by Bazhun’an, and even the HolyEmperor was no exception. Since Elder Han had stayed in the Inner Island before, he should be one of them?</p><p>In that case, he must be a backup left behind by Eighth Brother, and that was why he came to the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes from the Inner Island?</p><p>That was not right!</p><p>Even the Holy Emperor couldn’t do it, so how did Elder Han do it?</p><p>Ye Xiao obviously had the same question as well, but she still had her own concerns. Her eyes hidden in the shadows glanced at Chen Tan, whose eyes were closed and he remained motionless, but she did not say anything.</p><p>But before she could ask, Rao Yaoyao knew that she was a person of few words and once again spoke as if there were no outsiders, ”</p><p>“The Frost Ferret’s expertise is in its ability to escape. It can shuttle back and forth through all kinds of spatial cracks, time cracks, seal cracks, and cracks of the Great Path. It’s impossible to guard against it.”</p><p>“Other people on the Inner Island of the Abyss Island can’t come out, but if it’s a Frost Ferret, it can theoretically come out after it paid a certain price.”</p><p>“However, after it came out, it probably lost its way and got into the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes…That was why it was sealed again until you came along.”</p><p>So…</p><p>Was this a stray Demi-Saint Ghost Beast that had escaped from the Inner Island of the Abyss Island?</p><p>Xu Xiashou’s heart trembled when he heard this. He could accept this explanation more than anyone else, even more so than red-clothed people!</p><p>This might sound ridiculous, but it was based on facts.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never been to the Inner Island of the Abyss Island, but it seemed that the stronger the person, the harder it was to come out. Only those with strange abilities had a slight chance to escape.</p><p>Feng Yujin was one, Patriarch Wuji was another, and now it was this Elder Han, this Frost Ferret?</p><p>When he thought of this, Xu Xiashou couldn’t sit still anymore.</p><p>Because from this point of view, this Frost Ferret, also known as Elder Han, seemed to be one of their own!</p><p>“I’m on the wrong side?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
