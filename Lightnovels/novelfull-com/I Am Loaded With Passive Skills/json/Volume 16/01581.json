He tried to calm himself down.</p><p>“What do I have to do to make such a patient hunter let his guard down and give himself away?”</p><p>He found an answer very quickly.</p><p>“A dying bird can wait for the hunter’s last shot!”</p><p>Now that he was in the disappearing state, Xu Xiaoshou felt and was assured that Ye Xiao could not see him.</p><p>However, just like how Jiang Buyi could use the holy realm to roughly locate him, the Storyteller could use the method of elimination to continuously shrink the exile space to find someone.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought that someone as smart and weird as Ye Xiao should have a special way to sense his existence. After all, this was a woman who had mastered the power of the God of Death!</p><p>When he thought of this, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had to show himself.</p><p>If he didn’t remove the Vanishing Technique and lure Ye Xiao out, Xu Xiaoshou would never be at peace.</p><p>“Take the easy way out!”</p><p>In his disappearing state, Xu Xiaoshou was like a headless fly that dashed about randomly.</p><p>After he ran more than ten miles, he finally stopped after he had completely lost his way in the labyrinth.</p><p>“I’m already lost. If Ye Xiao can keep up with me while I teleported in my disappearing state, I’ll live-stream myself eating sh*t!”</p><p>This time, Xu Xiashou bet that he was definitely fighting with the air.</p><p>He had imagined an invincible enemy for himself, and his next experiment would never get a response.</p><p>He was just taking a risk…</p><p>He looked down and saw that his clothes had been ripped off after the battle, but his internal injuries had mostly healed. After all, there were still remnants of the aura of the saint calamity and his injuries could not be completely healed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gritted his teeth and used his Sharpness to cut himself until he bled. He restored the injuries he had suffered when he escaped from the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes and then removed the Vanishing Technique.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Somewhere on the labyrinth’s wall, a bloody figure fell and stopped when his head hit the ground and dragged himself forward for about ten feet. Finally, he leaned against the wall with difficulty, his face covered in dust, and propped up his broken body.</p><p>Chen Tan’s eyes were filled with horror. His pupils and his hands trembled slightly. Upon closer inspection, his eyelids still twitched uncontrollably.</p><p>“Saint Sword Deity Rao actually dared to become a Saint here, and I can’t even withstand the Ultimate Attribute…”</p><p>“Elder Han, that Frost Ferret is actually a ghost beast…”</p><p>Chen Tan muttered to himself in a low voice. He took out some Elixirs from his spatial ring and swallowed them with difficulty. After he calmed down, he took a deep breath.</p><p>“It’s alright…”</p><p>He looked around, as if he was trying to see if there were any people who followed him.</p><p>“Ye Xiao…”</p><p>“God Execution Order…”</p><p>“Why… No, something was wrong… It should be…”</p><p>After more than a quarter of an hour, Chen Tan changed his position several times and half reclined, but he still muttered to himself from time to time.</p><p>After he carried out this act for more than a quarter of an hour, Xu Xiaoshou reached his absolute limit. His “Perception” constantly searched for possible auras in the surroundings, and he even used the Information Bar and the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale.</p><p>But there was no one!</p><p>He suspected that maybe he was just a fool. He was really overthinking. If he told this to his little Junior Sister, she would laugh at him for the rest of her life!</p><p>But since it had come to this, the show had to continue.</p><p>It was better to fight wits with air than to compete with the actual person for patience.</p><p>At this time, the Elixirs should have taken effect. Chen Tan barely regained his mobility. He supported himself against the wall, stood up and smirked.</p><p>“No matter what, I’ve got the God Execution Order. The next thing is to find the exit and leave this d*mned place!”</p><p>He looked around and saw that there were no outsiders or Void Attendants, so he scooped some water from his spatial ring and rinsed his face violently.</p><p>He used so much force that it was as if he not only wanted to clean off the blood and dust on his face, but also wanted to rub his face off.</p><p>After a long while, Chen Tan finally stopped. He loweredhis hands in the dark labyrinth and raised his head.</p><p>“Well, Chen Tan’s identity has come to an end. Who should I impersonate next? Xu Xiaoshou? Ye Xiao?” Chen Tan muttered. He casually took out a bronze mirror from his spatial ring and gently raised it.</p><p>In the mirror, with the help of the faint light, one could see that after he washed his face, there was a completely flat and terrifying face without any facial features!</p><p>This was Xu Xiaoshou’s ultimate move, Transformation!</p><p>He believed that as long as there was someone who spied on him, they would be terrified when they saw Chen Tan muttering to himself after he washed his face. With the help of the bronze mirror, they would take a closer look and discover that this human face had turned into such a ghostly sight.</p><p>Especially now that he was in the First Hall of Sins, that had such an unknown and horrifying environment.</p><p>His flat face twitched slightly, and a soft chuckle came out of nowhere. Chen Tan rubbed his face and started to casually pinch his face.</p><p>At the same time, he focused his mind on the Information Bar that had not moved from the beginning to the end. He wanted to see if this ultimate move would bring about any Transformation.</p><p>At a certain moment, he was not sure if it was an illusion and Chen Tan’s movements froze for a second, but he quickly came back to himself. After he thought of the direction, he continued to pinch his face.</p><p>It was just that his facial features had not been revealed yet. Otherwise, Chen Tan, who was essentially Xu Xiaoshou, felt that he had been exposed.</p><p>The Information Bar moved!</p><p>A piece of information had really popped up!</p><p>In an environment where there was no one around!</p><p>“(Stunned, Passive Points), +1.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
