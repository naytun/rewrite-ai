Naturally, Xu Xiaoshou, who landed at the edge of the corner, was also targeted.</p><p>The Ghost Inscription in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up, and without any second thought, he forcefully controlled the group of hungry ghosts.</p><p>However, he never expected that the spirits in the heads of these d*mned things would be controlled by him too. With a twist, their heads were torn off from their bodies. Then, they would wave their arms about like a bunch of headless chickens, grab the air, and stuff them into their necks… It was simply horrifying!</p><p>If anyone was caught, who knew how many pieces its soul would be torn into!</p><p>“D*mn it, did they use this move to scare people to death?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked and retreated. He did not want to provoke this group of things at all.</p><p>This was a battle between Ye Xiao and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. He was very clear about his position and just watched the show.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>He was pursued by the ghosts all the way as he kept a close eye on the battlefield.</p><p>After the first gate opened, the second gate followed suit and opened with a bang.</p><p>This gate of death, which depicted the image of a large cauldron filled with people being boiled was different from the former. Once it opened, endless turbid yellow boiling water flowed out.</p><p>It looked like the waters of Huang Quan that had been boiled!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the endless mass of boiling soup had engulfed the entire field.</p><p>Moreover, the water level continued to rise, from ankles to knees… It kept rising!</p><p>“What the hell is this?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was forced into the sky, and his eyes were filled with horror.</p><p>He had once again experienced what it meant by ‘When the gods fight, the mortals suffer’.</p><p>The battle between the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and Ye Xiao had just begun, and he was actually the first one to be injured!</p><p>The space became distorted from the steam of the boiling soup.</p><p>Everything was gone, and he could not see anything clearly.</p><p>The extent of Xu Xiaoshou’s curiosity was limited. He didn’t want to know what the consequences would be should he be contaminated by these filthy things.</p><p>Just like the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, he kept flying up.</p><p>As long as the Five Decays of Heaven and Man doesn’t take action, I don’t have to do anything. I’ll do whatever he does. If he is defeated, then I’ll use the Vanishing Technique.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man also seemed to be shocked by Ye Xiao’s move. He had the same thoughts as Chen Ruye, who was behind him. He didn’t want to have a taste of the hot soup at all.</p><p>Just like how Ye Xiao chose to avoid his power of decay, he also had a strong fear of the power of Ye Xiao’s God of Death.</p><p>At this moment, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man keenly noticed that the Ye Xiao, who had opened the Three Gates of Suffering, seemed to be unable to support herself, and her body trembled slightly.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>The third door opened instantly at the same time.</p><p>This time, countless dark green soul blades flew out from it.</p><p>The soul blades were surrounded by karma fire, and everywhere they passed, they ignited the entire void. Even the boiling soup below was instantly dyed and turned into a sea of fire as it bubbled and boiled.</p><p>“D*mn!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou went berserk. He had been forced to the end of his tether.</p><p>You’ve taken over all the land, sea, and air, and used the geographical advantage of the entire space to the extreme. Ye Xiao, you’re really too much!</p><p>As he dodged to the left and right like the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, a thought suddenly came to Xu Xiaoshou’s mind.</p><p>Master Siren always said that his inspiration was extraordinary and he could see what ordinary people couldn’t, which meant that his soul body was also very powerful.</p><p>Ye Xiao’s Three Gates of Suffering was a group attack skill, so the damage incurred by a single soul blade shouldn’t be that terrifying.</p><p>He did as he thought!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou decided to give it a try. He couldn’t hide anymore.</p><p>He could hide today, but could he hide in the future?</p><p>In the future, if he encountered someone like Ye Xiao again, or if a situation arose where he had to face such a person alone and had no choice but to fight back, he would have to use all his strength.</p><p>If he did not know the strength of the other party’s attack, how could he come up with a counterattack?</p><p>The Ghost Inscription in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes glowed with a dim light. In high spirits, he directly lifted a large number of headless hungry ghosts with his All Things are Swords into the boiling soup and mixed them together to form a phantom sword.</p><p>He held the phantom sword made of hungry ghosts in his hand and slashed at one of the soul blades that aimed at his head.</p><p>‘Sizzle…”</p><p>The phantom sword didn’t even come into contact with the soul blade. It only got close to the karma fire on the soul blade and was reduced to ashes instantly!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned pale with fright and tilted his head.</p><p>The soul blade sliced through his scalp, but it didn’t hurt his soul body.</p><p>However, the karma fire had ignited on his head!</p><p>“Ah..:</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou covered his head and screamed in pain.</p><p>The karma fire did not burn his soul, but his seven emotions and six desires, and the three dirt stains on his Spiritual Intelligence!</p><p>When the karma fire ignited, Xu Xiaoshou felt that everything in his mind had turned demonic.</p><p>Desire, emotions, distracting thoughts, spiritual intelligence… They all bared their fangs and claws and started to tear his head apart.</p><p>“+(Attacked, Passive Points+)+1.”</p><p>“+(Attacked, Passive Points+)+1.” When a light flickered in his spiritual altar and after his Spirit Awakening, Xu Xiaoshou finally regained his consciousness after the pain.</p><p>At this moment, he was shocked to find that his body was falling. He was already submerged in the sea of boiling soup on the ground from his waist down.</p><p>The burning heat began to spread from his soles…</p><p>“+(Startled, Passive Points,+)+1.”</p><p>Attack!!!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou roared at the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. His eyes almost popped out and were bloodshot.</p><p>Ye Xiao was too strong!</p><p>One of the tens of millions of soul blades out of one-third of her spiritual technique could already inflict such damage on him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
