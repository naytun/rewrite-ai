(2)</p><p>Because in this world, Chen Ruye was the only one who truly understood Xu Xiaoshou the best!</p><p>As for who the lucky one was…</p><p>Who cares? “Whoosh!”</p><p>The golden sword light flashed in the dark labyrinth.</p><p>The decaying Void Attendant turned into minced meat and fell to the ground. In the end, with a sizzle, it turned into a gray-black stream of air and flowed into the orange robe.</p><p>“Senior Deva, it seems we still have to rely on you. I’m no match for the Void Attendant being the junior that I am.”</p><p>Gu Qinger’s entire body was stained with blood, his sword robe in tatters and even his face was covered with so much blood that it was difficult to make out his actual features, stood still and turned to the orange-robed masked man behind him.</p><p>Gu Qinger carried a sword wheel on his back that contained eight Spiritual Swords.</p><p>He also inserted the famed sword, The Bewitching Demon into the center of the sword wheel, then sat down cross-legged and began to regulate his breathing.</p><p>“Senior, I need to rest for a while.”</p><p>“You’re not afraid of the Ultimate attribute of the First Hall of Sins, but they’re a little too strong for me. I can feel my Life force being drained rapidly and I can’t hold on much longer.”</p><p>Gu Qinger said as he picked up the weeds on his shoulder and threw them away. He couldn’t bear the stench that emanated from his body and wanted to close his eyes.</p><p>His originally black hair had turned white, and his ophryon had turned black due to the blood stains. His entire body was lifeless, and he felt he didn’t have long to live.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man walked over from a distance and said calmly.</p><p>“You’re Sword Deity Wen’s disciple, how could you be so weak?”</p><p>“Stand up. You still need to lead the Way of the Sword. The main hall of the First Hall of Sins is not hidden behind your closed eyes, but in the distance ahead.”</p><p>Gu Qinger, who was extremely weak, didn’t refute. He immediately stood up, and his spirit was awakened. “Senior is right!”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man walked side by side with him and said as they walked.</p><p>“Kid, you can’t fall now. You have to hold on until someone comes to save you.”</p><p>“Remember, before that moment comes, you are the disciple of the Honorable Sword Deity Wen. You said that your Supreme Master has entered the Demi-Saint State, so no one in the First Hall of Sins would dare to touch you.”</p><p>“In the presence of outsiders, Yama and the Burial Sword Tomb make the best partners.”</p><p>“When there is danger, you’ll be my strongest shield, no one else.”</p><p>Gu Qinger’s dazed eyes lit up, he pounded his chest with his fist and shouted, “My honor!”</p><p>Da.</p><p>A noise could be heard from the end of the labyrinth’s passage that was like a drop of water falling to the ground. In the silence, and the crisp sound was magnified in their ears.</p><p>“Senior, someone is here.”</p><p>“Go. Ask what you need to ask and kill if you need to kill. This is a path for your growth.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the person in front of him calmly, and a flash of shock appeared in his eyes.</p><p>This bloodied and lifeless fellow was actually the Second Brother of the three brothers in the Gu family in the Burial Sword Tomb.</p><p>At the Lone Cliff, he had used the Ten Thousand Sword Technique, the Absolute Imperial Control and shattered the Internal World of the Cloud Realm and freed himself. In the next second, he had jumped off the cliff and committed suicide in grief and anger.</p><p>To think that the next time they met would be at the First Hall of Sins…</p><p>“What’s going on? How did he deteriorate to this extent? What happened to him?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded. He knew that this person was the beloved disciple of the Seven Sword Deity Wen Ting, the Sovereign Stage of the Way of the Sword.</p><p>He was so powerful… Even if he was not ranked on the Abyss Island, he was still one of the best among the younger generation.</p><p>He shouldn’t have ended up in this condition, based on his status and the treasures he had. Did he get beaten up by a Void Attendant?</p><p>Oh right, there was also the Ultimate Attribute here, and ordinary people would find it difficult to resist this Ultimate Attribute…</p><p>However, since Gu Qinger could survive under the Deep Sea until now, it meant that he should have the ability to deal with the spiritual source and his life force being sucked away. How could he have ended up in such a sorry state now?</p><p>Soon, Xu Xiaoshou saw the figure far behind Gu Qinger.</p><p>He was in an orange robe, an orange hood, and an orange mask. His entire body was exposed, and only his lifeless eyes were hidden in the shadows under the mask.</p><p>Yama’s man?</p><p>Orange…He didn’t seem to have seen this person before?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou closed his eyes slightly. It was as if a bolt of lightning had flashed in his mind, and in an instant, it had split into countless branches. His thoughts surged like a tide, and he couldn’t stop them.</p><p>“Who are you?” Gu Qinger folded his arms in front of his chest and shouted.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts stopped. He raised his head and looked at him and felt that the person in front of him was a different person.</p><p>In the past, Gu Qinger was at best young and frivolous, which was normal. If one was not frivolous, it would be a waste of youth, not to mention that Gu Qinger was a leading figure among the younger generation.</p><p>But now, this guy’s face was arrogant and resembled the hedonistic son of a rich family. He had changed.</p><p>Was he possessed?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at him calmly and asked instead of answering, “And who are you?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized that something was wrong.</p><p>How could this person change so much in such a short time?</p><p>You’re not Rao Yaoyao.At the very least, Rao Yaoyao had found a way and on the process to become a Saint.</p><p>You’re completely stupid!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s ‘Perception’ swept across the orange masked man in the distance. He thought of Yama and then he thought of the Lei Family’s Eyes, and soon associated it with the Three Loathsome Eyes..</p><p>In the Heavenly Prayer Forest, one of Jiang Xian’s two Three Loathsome Eyes was with the Greedy the Cat Spirit, and the other was obtained by Yama.</p><p>Could it be that this orange masked man had the other one?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that the only thing that could change a person so directly was the Three Loathsome Eyes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
