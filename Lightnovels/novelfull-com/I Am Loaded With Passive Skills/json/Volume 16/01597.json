The environment in Zhen Huang Palace was extremely humid.</p><p>Jiang Buyi crossed the small puddle in front of him and brought the Taboo Puppet behind him to the three-feet tall little giant in front of the table in the main hall.</p><p>It seemed like a statue of a giant?</p><p>It was clad in broken black-colored heavy armor and held a black trident in its hand. Silken spiderwebs draped over the gaps in its armor and its body was covered in dust. It must have been quite some time since someone had cleaned it.</p><p>This was normal. How many years had the Abyss Island been deserted?</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi had wanted to walk by the statue to search for what he wanted in the great hall.</p><p>Suddenly, just as his eyes left the giant statue, he felt as if he was being stared at by something, and the back of his head tingled.</p><p>But when he turned around, the giant statue had not moved.</p><p>Even its eyelids were closed, and only its eyeballs could be seen through the slits. Although the statue was lifelike, it had no vitality at all.</p><p>“Who’s there?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi said calmly. He was sure that it was not an illusion.</p><p>If the statue had not glanced at him just now, then there must have been someone else that secretly peeked at him in Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>Mu Zixi’s face was still pale, so Jiang Buyi’s shout did not cause her expression to change.</p><p>When she heard the old man’s words, she didn’t even look around. She only stared blankly at the tall statue that was a short distance away.</p><p>“Big watermelons, big watermelons, all of them are big watermelons, big fragrant and sweet watermelons…”</p><p>The puppet’s thoughts raced as she finally saw the statue of her good friend.</p><p>Since you’re a statue, then don’t dress up as God, play the devil. Just be like me.</p><p>Everyone, don’t mess around. Just be good and remain quiet, and don’t let anything happen, okay?</p><p>Jiang Buyi did not wait for a response and suddenly launched an attack. His palm that was wrapped with Holy Power, suddenly struck the head of the giant statue.</p><p>He had already verified that as long as he was not presumptuous, this level of probing would not waste the number of times he attacked.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the Holy Power from his palm was about to smashthe statue’s head.</p><p>At this moment, the giant statue suddenly trembled, and the dust flew off its body. Its eyelids suddenly lifted, and its pupils quivered and two rays filled with spiritual quality erupted from them.</p><p>Holy Power fluctuation!</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi did not hesitate and retreated instantly.</p><p>When the wind suddenly howled, he had already retreated a few hundred feet from the great hall and had stepped outside.</p><p>Only Heaven knew how torturous it was to have an exile order in one’s mind. This caused Jiang Buyi’s first reaction in the face of danger to alwaysretreat, and not to shatter anything radically.</p><p>However, with his retreat, a certain someone had also been sent to the front.</p><p>Mu Zixi was dumbfounded.</p><p>As soon as the giant statue awoke, the old bodyguard in front of her disappeared and left her to face so many horrors on her own!</p><p>Her legs felt leaden and she couldn’t even lift them.</p><p>Her entire body was like a machine that had just been wound up. Only her head turned back sluggishly, and her eyes stared at Jiang Buyi.</p><p>“Big watermelon, save me. How can you retreat and leave me alone…”</p><p>Mu Zixi did not dare to say anything, but Jiang Buyi’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>At this moment, even he, a Demi- Saint, felt his hair stand on end for no reason. That was because there were two pairs of eyes that stared at him!</p><p>Originally, he only had one enemy that was the statue.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s retreat seemed to have angered the Taboo Puppet. She even cast a cursed look at him…</p><p>“Hu!”</p><p>Without any hesitation, the Holy Power of the Cloud Attribute gently lifted the Taboo Puppet. Jiang Buyi carried her out of the palace and placed her far away from him.</p><p>At this moment, he sensed that the curse-filled gaze had disappeared.</p><p>I almost had to face two enemies…</p><p>Jiang Buyi glanced at the Taboo Puppet, who had lowered its head again as if it had given up any thoughts to attack. He finally let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>Only then did he have the time to re-examine the giant statue in the great hall.</p><p>“Sinner… Why… visit… Zhen Huang Palace…”</p><p>The giant statue spoke. Its voice was hoarse and sounded like dry stones that rubbed against each other.</p><p>Jiang Buyi barely understood the meaning of the giant statue’s words. He was still vigilant, but his worry had been greatly reduced.</p><p>They could communicate…</p><p>This was really great!</p><p>At the very least, it would be much better than the Taboo Puppet whose intentions were unknown.</p><p>“Who are you, and why are you here?” Jiang Buyi said coldly.</p><p>Even if he couldn’t attack now, the Demi-Saint’s aura was still strong and he did not need to look out for the unknown.</p><p>Even though this unknown came from the First Hall of Sins, it seemed to be different from the Void Attendant. Only the mysterious Taboo Puppet could compete with it.</p><p>Well, there were also Holy Power fluctuations…</p><p>Was this statue a creature at the Demi-Saint level?</p><p>While Jiang Buyi made a guess, the stone giant spoke again, “Void General… Sin…”</p><p>Void General?</p><p>Void Attendant?</p><p>It was hard for Jiang Buyi not to connect the two. Soon, he found some information about the Abyss Island from the depths of his memory.</p><p>There was still a living Void General on the Abyss Island?</p><p>‘Sin’ was its name?</p><p>Jiang Buyi did not dare to act rashly. If the statue in front of him was really a Void General, it meant that it most likely had the ability to kill a Saint.</p><p>The Abyss Island was perfect for the higher void, where opportunities and dangers coexisted. However, it was too difficult for a Demi-Saint.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
