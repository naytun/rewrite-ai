From the moment the Power of the Evil God appeared, Chen Tan was destined to fall into the hands of the Holy Divine Palace because the Power of the Ancestral Source can’t be exposed to the outside world, even if it’s just an aura.”</p><p>When he looked back at the whole thing from a third-person perspective, and put himself in the shoes of the Holy Divine Palace, Xu Xiaoshou found that all the explanations made sense.</p><p>Both Ye Xiao and Rao Yaoyao knew that Chen Tan had the Power of the Evil God, but they didn’t try to snatch the God Execution Order at the first instance. Instead, they chose to deal with Elder Han.</p><p>What this meant was that the Holy Divine Palace would definitely take you, Chen Tan, be it now or in the future.</p><p>The God Execution Order you have is equivalent to being placed in the treasure vault of the Holy Divine Palace, because you were already in the records of the treasure vault.</p><p>After all, the Power of the Evil God could never leak out!</p><p>“That was why Elder Xie cherished his life. After he obtained this secret skill, no one around him knew about it.”</p><p>“Even Ghost Granny, who was closest to him, only knew a thing or two about him. She knew that he practiced some kind of Southern Region evil technique, but she was not aware of the roots.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart trembled.</p><p>But fortunately, the one being targeted was Chen Tan, and had nothing to do with me Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>From the results of the deduction, it wasn’t difficult to deduce that Rao Yaoyao would immediately return after her battle with Elder Han and look for Chen Tan through some means.</p><p>Or…</p><p>“Before Rao Yaoyao and Elder Han started their battle, she specifically instructed Ye Xiao to keep an eye on Chen Tan, which meant to keep an eye on me!” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes suddenly turned cold, as he understood the underlying meaning of this sentence.</p><p>“So after Elder Han’s Ganges River assault, Ye Xiao disappeared, and she was already on the lookout for me. After the Saint Calamity, Ye Xiao even appeared to be blown to bits. Was that a show to give the impression that she was on the verge of death?”</p><p>“There’s still no news of her?”</p><p>He recalled how Ye Xiao had not appeared from the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes. He then concluded that she might have already come out.</p><p>According to his current deduction, Ye Xiao would likely be watching him at all times…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt a chill run down his spine!</p><p>He was currently in his Disappearing state and all traces of himself in the world had been erased. How could he be tracked?</p><p>“Am I scaring myself?”</p><p>Some absurd thoughts flashed through Xu Xiaoshou’s mind. He wanted to treat these as unnecessary worries, but then he thought about it…</p><p>It was understandable that a Chief of the Six Divisions like Teng Shanhai would die at the hands of Jiang Buyi. He died because of his stupidity.</p><p>Even after he stepped into Patriarch Wuji’s trap, it was still so difficult to die. He was smart, but from the current perspective, all of his abilities weren’t suitable for battle.</p><p>Even so, he had persevered for so long, longer than most of the higher void level he knew.</p><p>As an individual, he was very powerful, but in the six divisions of the Holy Divine Palace, he was just an intelligence worker.</p><p>The truly war-oriented divisions were the Dao division and two other divisions aside from the remaining four. Among them, the Dark division specialized in assassination!</p><p>“Assassination…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to equate Ye Xiao with that.</p><p>How could the combat strength of an intelligence officer be compared to that of an assassin?</p><p>Therefore, when he faced Ye Xiao, one had to vigilant. In fact, one had to be several times more vigilant.</p><p>“If we look at it from this perspective, there’s a high chance that I wasn’t just scaring myself. Everything was really being executed…”</p><p>“Ye Xiao kept me under surveillance!”</p><p>It was as if his mind had exploded, and Xu Xiaoshou felt as if the scene he had seen in the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes had come back.</p><p>The woman in the black cloak on the Necromancer’s shoulder suddenly looked up. The three-legged black owl on her shoulder shrieked, and the eyes of the God of Death behind her opened coldly and drowned out all the colors in the sky.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt goosebumps all over his body.</p><p>He once again checked all the places on his body that he might have overlooked, whether there was a crow feather hidden somewhere, and whether there wasany whiff of the dangerous woman’s aura.</p><p>But there were none.</p><p>Everything was normal, and there was no risk notification in the Information Bar.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heartbeat accelerated. Either he had overthought, or the situation was worse than he expected!</p><p>He wasn’t a happy-go-lucky person. Whenever he thought of the ‘dark group’, the ‘assassins’, and the ‘tri-colored hunting order’ that could only be obtained by the successful assassination of a Demi-Saint, he felt flustered.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s sense of danger about Ye Xiao increased by more than one level.</p><p>He suddenly thought of something.</p><p>Ye Xiao had mastered the Power of the God of Death. This was the same Power of the ancestral source as Teng Shanhai’s Power of Demon God. However, the Power of ancestral source was something that only the Holy Emperor could comprehend.</p><p>In other words, could the Power of the ancestral source achieve an effect that only the power of a Holy Emperor could achieve to a certain extent?</p><p>“Then is there a possibility that I have been guided?”</p><p>“Obstruct all the guidance from the outside world targeted at Xu Xiaoshou and Chen Tan. It’s best if you can block and remove it… Obstruct, obstruct, obstruct!”</p><p>Again and again.</p><p>He didn’t know if it was the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale’s ability or if it was a psychological effect, but Xu Xiaoshou felt his thoughts become much clearer.</p><p>“If I’m already a targeted prey and Ye Xiao is a hunter who hadassassinated a Demi-Saint before, then her greatest quality must be her patience…”</p><p>“D*mn, she was really patient! I spent the whole day looking for the way out of the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes, and she just stared at me the whole time. That f*cking look of a hunter staring at his prey!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
