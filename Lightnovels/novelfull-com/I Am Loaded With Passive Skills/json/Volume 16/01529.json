He didn’t move, but more self-introductory words came out of his mouth.</p><p>“I’m Wen Chong!”</p><p>“Tan Ji is just my name…I’m Xiao Shi.”</p><p>“Xu Deye.”</p><p>“To tell you the truth, senior, Xu Deye is indeed just a pseudonym. My actual name is Xu Fuji!”</p><p>“…Bazhun’an.”</p><p>“I am Saint Jiang Buyi!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Their tones were different, and there was a sharp contrast in their momentum.</p><p>This self-introduction ended after a long time.</p><p>At this moment, the entire first floor of the attic was deathly silent. Kong Yuhen stared blankly at him and Xu Xiaoshou’s face turned red as he felt that he had been stripped bare.</p><p>The two of them looked at each other and remained speechless for some time.</p><p>“What’s the situation?”</p><p>“Why did I babble on like that?”</p><p>“I didn’t say any of that, but they just came out of my mouth…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt numb, but he could vaguely remember when and where he had uttered the same self-introduction. After all, these words had come from his mouth before.</p><p>In the past?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou acutely noticed the blind spot, and his heart trembled.</p><p>“Could it be that Kong Yuhen had already used his ability when he posed this question?”</p><p>“From a higher time dimension, he managed to extract all my self-introductions when I was in a different situation in each time and space? ”</p><p>When he thought of this, Xu Xiaoshou felt an inexplicable fear.</p><p>What kind of weird ability was this? it was too terrifying. Didn’t this mean that no one could keep any secrets from Kong Yuhen?</p><p>“You’re a little untruthful.” It took a long time for Kong Yuhen to register the long list of names he had rattled off. He smiled and said, “So, who exactly are you?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou.” Xu Xiaoshou dared not lie now.</p><p>This was a big Boss whose attitude and position were still unclear. If he were to suddenly go against him, it might be too late for regrets.</p><p>The key was that after the number of identities given, he only needed to spend some time to dig out the correct information. Presumably, the person in front of him would immediately be able to determine what the face behind so many names looked like.</p><p>Therefore, there was no need to lie anymore.</p><p>“Then let me call you…friend!”</p><p>Kong Yuhen didn’t seem to accept the name ‘Xu Xiaoshou’. He laughed and walked back to the tea table located in the middle of the attic and sat on the main seat opposite.</p><p>He raised his hand and the dust on the left side cleared instantly. Then, he used the hot water in the teapot to brew a cup of tea and motioned for Xu Xiaoshou to sit down. “Friend, please have a seat.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou walked over, sat down and looked confused.</p><p>“I’m sure there are many things you don’t understand. This has made you very vigilant, so there’s no harm in asking.” Kong Yuhen smiled and added, “I have no ill intentions.”</p><p>“I can ask anything?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“Yes, you can ask anything.” Kong Yuhen nodded.</p><p>“Alright, my first question is, where is this place?” Xu Xiaoshou still didn’t dare to drink the tea, and asked as he stared at Kong Yuhen who held the teacup.</p><p>“This is the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion.” Kong Yuhen sighed and shook his head gently. He took a sip, closed his eyes and savored the taste for a while before he responded.</p><p>His movements and expression were extremely relaxed, as if he was an idle person outside of this world. He had no worries or anxieties and seemed out of place in this world.</p><p>It had to be due to this location…Xu Xiaoshou had expected this, and he was even more confused. “But I remember I entered the First Hall of Sins, if my memory served me correctly?”</p><p>“How can my memory be wrong? No one can change it…”</p><p>Kong Yuhen smiled and put down his teacup. He looked over and said, “I placed the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion in the First Hall of Sins. Those with weak inspirations can’t see me, but those with strong inspirations can enter different Land Realms from the same time and space and the same position, which is my Pavilion.”</p><p>“Inspiration?”</p><p>“Yes, to put it in layman’s terms so you can understand, the Spiritual power and Soul power are both different from that of ordinary people.”</p><p>“This is why I can see the Void General Hong, but Master Siren and Xiao Kongtong are not able to see it. Why was it that we entered the First Hall of Sins together, but they did not come to this place and I did?”</p><p>“How do we differentiate the strength and weakness of this spiritual inspiration and how do we cultivate it?” Xu Xiaoshou asked after a moment of silence.</p><p>“It’s easy to distinguish. Those who can enter are from one class, and those who can’t are from another class.” Kong Yuhen held the teacup in his hand and was extremely calm. “As for cultivation, let’s not talk about such serious topics here. Let’s just talk about these two situations.”</p><p>“You are really confident…” Xu Xiaoshou cursed silently. He didn’t dare to think too much and asked, “Which two?”</p><p>“One is those who are born with strong spiritual perception. This is a natural talent. There is no reason for it, and it cannot be imitated.”</p><p>“Second is that they are born with a weak spiritual sense, but they had undergone trials and tribulations in the mortal world and their spiritual senses had been tampered with. Their physical performance is poor but their spiritual sense is rich.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. He felt as if he had connected with something. He didn’t dare to think too much and asked, “But I have not undergone much training in my life. My body is rich, but my soul is lacking. As for talent, I know that my talent isn’t that extraordinary and is within the normal range.”</p><p>“Of course you don’t have the talent.” Kong Yuhen smiled and reaffirmed the second part of Xu Xiaoshou’s sentence. Then he changed the topic. “But you’ve had enough training.”</p><p>“I did not…” Xu Xiaoshou retorted subconsciously.</p><p>“Friend, you’re lying again. You like to lie a lot. That is a sign of anxiety. Maybe you haven’t noticed it yet.” Kong Yuhen said this slowly. He picked up the teacup and took a sip and gestured to Xu Xiaoshou to take a sip as well. “This tea is good.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
