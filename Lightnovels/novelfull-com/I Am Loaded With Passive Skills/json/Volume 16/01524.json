For example, Possession, the ability to forcibly plunder or also for example, the power of the Ghost Beast.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s eyes swept past Mu Zixi and landed on Xu Xiaoshou. He seemed to have some knowledge of some profound inside information.</p><p>The power of the Ghost Beast?</p><p>“What?” Xu Xiaoshou was slightly stunned. “How can the power of the Ghost Beast be added to the power of the bounded domain?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong spread his hands and chuckled, “I’m not too sure about that. The power of the Ghost Beast is something that low-level Spiritual Cultivators can’t get their hands on, and the elites among the Spiritual Cultivators don’t dare to get involved in. It’s a special power that only a few people are doing a research on. Unfortunately, I haven’t studied it before.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Master Siren and wanted to see if this knowledgeable Teacher knew anything about this.</p><p>“I don’t really understand, but I do have a vague idea. If we want to know the answer to this question, we might have to start from the Holy Divine Palace and the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.” Mei Siren shook his head.</p><p>Climb the Saint mountain?</p><p>This was not looking for an answer, more like looking for death, right?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had once bragged shamelessly to Elder Sang that he would kill his way up the Saint mountain when he reached the Sovereign Stage. After he witnessed the combat strength of the Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi, he felt that he had indeed underestimated the experts in the world.</p><p>It was still unknown whether a Sovereign Dao Realm expert could kill his way up the Saint mountain. It mainly depended on how much the system could increase his combat strength. However, if he wanted to find an answer for the bounded domain, going up the Saint mountain would be like throwing a meat bun at a dog. He would definitely not return.</p><p>As for…Greedy the Cat Spirit!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not want to sign a Ghost Beast contract with Greedy the Cat Spirit, just because of the bounded domain.</p><p>In his opinion, his relationship with Greedy the Cat Spirit would be nothing more than an intimate sort of connection after they signed the contract.</p><p>Moreover, the ‘contract’ was an additional layer of restraint. It was very likely that it would not only bring about an improvement in the relationship, but it would also be associated with strange powers like the Xu Yue Grey Palace.</p><p>If it involved Ghost Beasts, it would be difficult to escape from some of the karma.</p><p>With this in mind, Xu Xiaoshou thought for a while and asked, “Teacher, Eldest Senior Brother, do you know what kind of faction the Southern Region’s Xu Yue Grey Palace is?”</p><p>This was an abrupt change to the topic, but it did not seem to be without reason.</p><p>As if he had connected the dots, Xiao Kongtong’s expression darkened, and he said, “My suggestion would be that you don’t set foot there. The Xu Yue Grey Palace is indeed another way to cultivate a bounded domain, but it’s too chaotic there. The risk of going to the Xu Yue Grey Palace would be no less than if you were to go to the Saint mountain.”</p><p>I think you’ve misunderstood. I just want to understand what the faction of Xu Yue Grey Palace is like…Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself, but he didn’t explain.</p><p>What Xiao Kongtong said opened the door to another world for him.</p><p>“How strong is the Xu Yue Grey Palace?” Xu Xiaoshou was slightly surprised. The risk of going there was no less than going up the Saint mountain. Didn’t this reaffirm the power of Xu Yue Grey Palace?</p><p>However, if it was so powerful, why were the skills of the people from the Xu Yue Grey Palace such as Caramel and Xin Gugu…only average?</p><p>Xiao Kongtong stared at Xu Xiaoshou for a long time before he sighed.</p><p>“Think about it. Within the five domains of the continent, which force would dare to casually mention the term ‘Ghost Beast’? They’re basically all tight-lipped about them.”</p><p>“Under such circumstances, the Xu Yue Grey Palace in the Southern Region is the first and only one that dared to actively involve Ghost Beasts and do a study of their power.”</p><p>“Logically speaking, it should have been destroyed a long time ago under the suppression of the Holy Divine Palace. However, it managed to survive until now. Why?”</p><p>That’s right, why?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t want to think about it at all. This was clearly his question, and Xiao Kongtong should be the one to answer it.</p><p>“Why?” Mu Zixi asked this question on his behalf.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong glanced at his Senior Brother and Junior Sister, and said in a serious tone, “It’s because of ‘chaos’!”</p><p>“The Southern Region is too chaotic. It’s different from the Central Region and the Eastern Region. There are obvious rules and order there. The Southern Region is a place without any order.”</p><p>“The Holy Divine Palace does not have many branches there, and they are all the less important counties and cities. They don’t have much say.”</p><p>“The ones who truly hold the power and authority in the Southern Region, and are trusted by the Spiritual Cultivators are the self-made intelligence organizations and the prestigious families born and raised in the Southern Region.”</p><p>“For example, the Xu Yue Grey Palace, the Half-Moon Residence, as well as many other forces that have mastered the strange sect’s evil techniques and power.”</p><p>“You need to understand that all the Spiritual Cultivators in the Southern Region specialize in ‘unorthodox’ abilities. Perhaps that’s not an accurate term to describe them, but it’s a good way to describe them, because their abilities are all very strange.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong seemed to have thought of something, and his expression became a little sorrowful.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou recalled the power he had obtained from Elder Xie. The Cursed Yin Eye was indeed not something that a normal Spiritual Cultivator could cultivate.</p><p>“It’s similar to Elder Xie’s ability. He must have been to the Southern Region previously in order to obtain this inheritance.” Xiao Kongtong nodded in agreement with Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts.</p><p>“Why is the Southern Region in such a mess?” Mu Zixi spoke again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself that he’d found a substitute for his mouth in the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>Little Junior Sister was useful in this aspect sometimes. Her curiosity overflowed. No matter who the person was, she would ask questions that most people didn’t dare to ask or didn’t get a response to at all.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
