She totally ignored Chen Tan’s thoughts and actions and strode into the Hall of No Pardon.</p><p>“Let’s explore together? If you and I find something together, we’ll split it equally. If any of us finds something, then it’ll belong to the individual. It’s very fair, very much like the Holy Divine Palace, so is that alright?” Xu Xiaoshou smiled as he followed Ye Xiao into the Inner hall.</p><p>He had to think of a way to kill her!</p><p>His ‘Stealth’ hid the killing intent behind Xu Xiaoshou’s smiling face very well.</p><p>According to the memories of the Three Incenses killers such as Double Dumba*s and Golden Foot, Ye Xiao, this Dark Division Chief was probably the one who had issued the order for the Black Gold Bounty.</p><p>“This evil woman is here to kill me.”</p><p>“As long as she finds any clues or that something is off about ‘Chen Tan’…I’m afraid she won’t say it out loud. She’ll only find an opportunity to deal a fatal blow…Yes, she’s an assassin.”</p><p>Therefore, instead of being passive, he should take the initiative and keep her here!</p><p>But…</p><p>“Can I make her stay?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s footsteps did not falter. He flew up slowly, but this thought flashed through his mind.</p><p>His thoughts were different. This person was a higher void level, that was the most difficult to kill. Without Patriarch Wuji’s blockade, she would probably escape in the end.</p><p>He thought of Teng Shanhai, the simple-minded but brawny fellow…His four limbs were simply too developed! After he activated the power of the Demon God, he could only back off and could not fight head on.</p><p>As such, Ye Xiao, the Dark Division Chief from the Six Divisions, was not an ordinary person.</p><p>The Holy Divine Palace even gave her the right to act first and report later; that only affirmed her high stratagems and accurate judgments, and also reflected her terrifying combat strength and her secret methods.</p><p>“A higher void level who is strategic and has both combat strength and status; she is by no means just an ordinary higher void level. She can even assassinate a Demi-Saint.”</p><p>“And indeed, this person seems to be from the Three Incenses and could also be a ‘Three-colored hunting order’ killer.”</p><p>“Three-colored hunting order was ranked above the red, purple, and gold hunting tokens. The condition to be promoted was to successfully assassinate a Demi-Saint…was the memory of Double Dumba*s really trustworthy?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt very troubled.</p><p>This was because he came to the conclusion that even though he might be able to fight against an ordinary higher void level by himself, it would definitely be difficult to kill or capture him, much less a peak higher void level like Ye Xiao, whose attributes and abilities were all strange.</p><p>“Let’s bide our time!”</p><p>“After all, if I don’t die after one strike, I’ll have to face a peak higher void level head-on.”</p><p>“There’s no Spell Forbidden Barrier like the one in the Deep Sea here and she obviously has Holy Blood. I don’t have much of an advantage with my background.”</p><p>As he flew into the Hall, Xu Xiaoshou saw the plaque above his head, and a bright light flashed in his eyes.</p><p>“Hall of No Pardon…”</p><p>“I hope you can surprise me.”</p><p>When they stepped into the Inner hall from the Outer Hall, the furnishings were completely different.</p><p>The Hall of No Pardon was simply an open execution ground with no shelter at all, and the vast Inner hall displayed no less than a hundred types of torture instruments.</p><p>The torture instruments shone with a cold light, were blood-stained, huge and were hundreds of feet high. Some were very small, obviously built to fit a human’s body.</p><p>“This is an execution ground. Were these big torture instruments used to punish the Void Attendants?” Xu Xiaoshou came to this conclusion.</p><p>Ye Xiao suddenly came to an abrupt halt and turned her head to look over.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly sobered up and realized that he had let the cat out of the bag.</p><p>From the information he had obtained from the soul memory of the higher void level, it was clear that the name ‘Abyss Island’ was still ‘Sky City’ for the ordinary people on the Shengshen continent.</p><p>As for the Void Attendant, he only knew a little about it. At the very least, he only knew it was a dark giant.</p><p>Therefore, a man from the Southern Region who could casually mention the ‘Void Attendant’ was obviously no stranger to the Abyss Island and the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>“Hey!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t panic. His eyebrows shot up and he continued with a smile, “It seems that Ms Ye Xiao is very attuned to the news about Sky City. You know about the Void Attendant?”</p><p>He paused for a moment and then Xu Xiaoshou suddenly realized something and muttered, “That’s true. You’re from the Holy Divine Palace. In the central region, the Holy Divine Palace is a great faction…”.</p><p>He did not attempt to hide his knowledge about the Abyss Island.</p><p>Ordinary people don’t understand this place, but I, Chen Tan, am not an ordinary person. That should suffice, right?</p><p>Moreover, it was impossible for an ordinary person to survive to this point after they entered the First Hall of Sins. They would have died at the hands of the Void Attendant long ago.</p><p>“Where did you get the information about the Void Attendant?” It was rare that Ye Xiao was willing to speak.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately looked interested. He leaned closer and asked curiously, “Do you want to exchange information? I can tell you the information, but Miss Ye Xiao must also produce a similar bargaining chip.”</p><p>He did not forget that he was someone from the Southern Region.</p><p>The Southern Region revered the Evil God, and all the top powers there were basically factions. Even the branch of the Holy Divine Palace found it difficult to have a strong foothold, let alone try to squeeze into the top factions of the Southern Region</p><p>He had learned all of this from his chat with Xiao Kongtong, and Xu Xiaoshou had perfected his Chen Tan characteristics from the details.</p><p>Ye Xiao didn’t say anything more. She looked away and sized up her surroundings. It was obvious she was not in the least interested about the exchange of information.</p><p>“That was close!” Xu Xiaoshou exclaimed in his heart. “This woman was simply too attuned. It was best not to speak from now on. The more you spoke, the more mistakes you would make. It was tiring to deal with smart people.”</p><p>“Ai, compared to the Chief of the Six Divisions, I still prefer to fight with people like Teng Shanhai!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
