(1)</p><p>Do I know what the outcome was!</p><p>I don’t even know the name of the palace master of the Xu Yue Grey Palace. You’re just trying to trick me!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was clearly tired of this method, so how could he follow what the Five Decays of Heaven and Man said?</p><p>As long as he followed along, no matter what he said, he would definitely be exposed in the end.</p><p>So, he crossed his arms quietly and stared at the opposite side and waited for the next part, with a teasing expression.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man did not follow up.</p><p>His calm gaze met the young man’s and he kept quiet too.</p><p>The two of them just stood in the vast wilderness for a long time as they enjoyed the breeze and stared at each other.</p><p>“Ha.” Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but laugh out loud.</p><p>“Senior, are you trying to compete with me in the game of patience? Why don’t you continue? I’m waiting!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not give the Five Decays of Heaven and Man a chance to react before he paused and said.</p><p>“Senior Deva, I’ve met your boss Yama before. He once followed my Elder to discuss a collaboration on behalf of the Xu Yue Grey Palace. This… Do you know what the outcome was?”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was stunned and then he laughed for a long time.</p><p>His laughter went from scorn at the beginning to unrestrained, and finally converged into a sinister and cold laugh.</p><p>“Hehehe, little guy, it’s really rare to see someone at your age who can handle himself so impeccably.”</p><p>“You’re too kind.” Xu Xiaoshou was unmoved.</p><p>He still didn’t know why the Five Decays of Heaven and Man pursued him. There was no enmity between the two of them, so it couldn’t be that he opened up another space-time just for this meaningless nonsense.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was still waiting.</p><p>He felt that when this perverted Five Decays of Heaven and Man was done playing, perhaps it would end in a fight or something else.</p><p>“You’re not curious about my affairs, but I’m curious about yours.” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man strolled over. “So, what was the gist of the cooperation you discussed with Lord Hong Quan and what was the outcome?”</p><p>“You don’t know?” Xu Xiaoshou did not want to give any explanation at all. He spread out his hands in surprise. “Senior, have you ever thought of this possibility? Maybe, the reason why Lord Huang Quan didn’t tell you could mean that you don’t deserve to know about it?”</p><p>At this moment, the wind in the entire grassland seemed to stop.</p><p>“How could I dare to overstep my boundaries when even Lord Huang Quan doesn’t want to tell you?” Xu Xiaoshou took half a step back and forced himself to calm down.</p><p>After his first attempt, he realized that even if he irked the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, the consequences were not significant. The other side did not even make a move!</p><p>This was too mysterious. What was he trying to do?</p><p>“You’re not afraid that I’ll kill you?” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man came nearer.</p><p>“How could Senior do that? Hehe.” Xu Xiaoshou’s face turned pale and he said drily, “If Senior wanted to kill me, why would you talk so much nonsense to one who is about to die? You must have other reasons to keep me here.”</p><p>“Chen Ruye!” Anger and dissatisfaction flashed across the eyes of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. He shouted, “Smart people die when they talk too much, and conspirators die from conceit. Do you know how you will die?”</p><p>“Thank you for your guidance, but I don’t think I will die.” Xu Xiaoshou’s momentum also rose, and he was not suppressed by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man at all. They were evenly matched.</p><p>“Kekeke…” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man laughed wretchedly, and his eyes were once again calm as if it would penetrate the body of the young man opposite him. He murmured, “You will die an unnatural death.”</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a gray-black aura of decay erupted from the Five Decays of Heaven and Man that lifted his robe and shuttled through the boundless wilderness.</p><p>With a loud bang, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man raised his left hand, and an extremely compressed and condensed torrent of decay shot out from the depths of the darkness between his sleeves.</p><p>You’re crazy!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was scared to death.</p><p>This guy was indeed unreasonable. The previous wave of probing was still fine, but now he suddenly wanted to kill him?</p><p>He felt that what the Five Decays of Heaven and Man said was very wrong, but he didn’t have time to think about what was wrong. When he was attacked, his subconscious reaction was to dodge.</p><p>However, when he inadvertently glanced at the Information Bar, Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>“(Received a warning. Passive Points),+1.”</p><p>A warning?</p><p>At that moment, it was as if a bolt of lightning had exploded in his mind.</p><p>The words of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man resounded again, but Xu Xiaoshou interpreted the second meaning.</p><p>You will die an unnatural death…</p><p>You will die an unnatural death!</p><p>Did this ‘unnatural’ really refer to the power and the curse of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man?</p><p>No!</p><p>What he meant was that he would die under unknown circumstances and would die at the hands of Ye Xiao, who hid in the dark and no one had noticed!”</p><p>“Why did he give me a warning?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils contracted, but he couldn’t think of an answer.</p><p>However, smart people always have a tacit understanding. Xu Xiaoshou realized that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man didn’t seem to have any malicious intent against him. The Information Bar did not even show any ‘sneak attack’ pop up message.</p><p>He stopped moving.</p><p>Chen Ruye from the Xu Yue Grey Palace seemed to have been scared silly by the words and aura of Yama’s Five Decays of Heaven and Man. He froze on the spot and even forgot to dodge.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>The torrent of decay passed through the space and poured onto Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Acalanatha!”</p><p>Even though he knew that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man might not be targeting him.</p><p>However, due to the unknown and uncontrollable development of events, Xu Xiaoshou could not fully trust this Yama’s man, whose intentions were unknown.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
