I majored in martial arts and my swordsmanship is indeed from the Feng family. It’s just that my background isn’t very decent, so I try not to spout nonsense and offend others.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s expression mellowed a little as she asked again, “You’ve seen Feng Wuhen?”</p><p>“No, I didn’t.” Xu Xiaoshou shook his head.</p><p>He didn’t dare to pretend anymore!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was a Seven Sword Deity and so was Feng Wuhen.</p><p>Who knew what their relationship was like? if he pretended that he was close to the Feng family, she might see through his disguise in the next second.</p><p>Good, good…</p><p>From the very beginning, Chen Tan’s Ancient Sword Technique was not up to standard but the technique was on the right path.</p><p>I cultivate the power of the evil God, so don’t think too much and don’t ask too many questions!</p><p>“Hand over the God Execution Order.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was indeed no longer interested in Chen Tan. She didn’t ask any more questions and gave the order.</p><p>“Oh, d*mn it, here it comes again…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was irritated. With a thought, the seal at the entrance of the Tian San cell suddenly cracked.</p><p>It’s your turn now Elder Han, to create some havoc here!</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>An ear-piercing roar of raucous laughter came out of the cell, and then it turned into a voice that was filled with flattery.</p><p>“Brother Chen, you’ve thought it through, so you’re going to let me out? Don’t worry, I won’t go back on my words!”</p><p>“Who’s your brother Chen!” Xu Xiaoshou retreated in fear and hurriedly denied their relationship. He looked at Rao Yaoyao and said, “He’s full of nonsense. Sword Deity Rao, you can ask Miss Ye Xiao if you don’t believe me.”</p><p>Miss Ye Xiao?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was stunned and for a moment, did not realize who he meant when he used that title.</p><p>Then, she glanced at Ye Xiao, who was on the Necromancer’s shoulder, with a strange look. She knew that Chen Tan told the truth when she saw that Ye Xiao remained silent.</p><p>Well, it was also true.</p><p>I would never have thought that you would be able to get close to Ye Xiao…</p><p>Rao Yaoyao secretly shook her head and laughed. Her attention had also been drawn to the Demi-Saint in the cell. This was the true master of this place!</p><p>“You’re Elder Han?”</p><p>“Huh?” Elder Han was surprised and a little delighted.” There’s another person here and a woman at that?”</p><p>D*mn…you’re a real master, you’re so audacious…Xu Xiaoshou trembled when he heard that, and subconsciously moved away from the cell door.</p><p>This place was no longer safe. Out of the thirty-six strategies, leaving was the best option.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s gaze turned cold.</p><p>The momentum she gave off when she entered was obviously not only felt by Xu Xiaoshou, but also by Elder Han who was in the cell.</p><p>Her red lips parted and without any ado, asked directly:</p><p>“You’re a Ghost Beast?”</p><p>There were still some chattering noises in the cell, and no one knew what Elder Han muttered to himself, but it suddenly became quiet.</p><p>After a short pause, Elder Han’s emotionless voice was heard again.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>“I am the Ruler of the red-clothed people, Rao Yaoyao!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had injected almost all of her aura in this sentence and this made it hard for Xu Xiaoshou to breathe in the Great Hall. In the end, she sniffed slightly and asked again in a loud voice.</p><p>“You’re a Ghost Beast?”</p><p>At this moment, even Xu Xiaoshou felt that as the Ruler of the red-clothed people, Rao Yaoyao was well-versed about Ghost Beasts.</p><p>She only needed to get a whiff of it, and even through the cell door, she was certain that Elder Han was a Ghost Beast!</p><p>But the next second, Xu Xiaoshou noticed that something was off.</p><p>It was because the Rao Yaoyao he knew in the past didn’t have this ability.</p><p>If she had any, the Ghost Beast Lair in the First Pavilion in the Sky, would long have been emptied!</p><p>So…</p><p>“She’s faking it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost slapped the table and praised her.</p><p>It all depended on how Elder Han dealt with this move. If there was even a slight hint of fear, then he was undoubtedly a Ghost Beast.</p><p>Who would have thought that Elder Han, who was inside the cell, would suddenly shout, “Rao Yaoyao, I know you. You’re the Seven Sword Deity!”</p><p>After he said that, he did not continue the conversation. Instead, he turned to Chen Tan. His tone was filled with deep worry, and he transmitted a message to him through telepathic communication.</p><p>“Brother Chen, the situation is not good now. There are two people from the Holy Divine Palace. In my current state, I can only help you block the original one.”</p><p>“But in this case, you definitely won’t be able to beat Rao Yaoyao, so you don’t have to rush to complete that mission.”</p><p>“Hurry up and unseal me. It might be too late if you delay any longer,”</p><p>The telepathic communication was very bad!</p><p>The seal on the cell door was extremely weak by this time.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even need to think twice to know that this would definitely be intercepted by Rao Yaoyao and Ye Xiao.</p><p>But…</p><p>“Mission?”</p><p>“What mission?”</p><p>In his daze, Xu Xiaoshou’s hair stood on end when he sensed Rao Yaoyao’s bitingly cold killing intent behind him.</p><p>“Dog thief!”</p><p>This guy was actually trying to show that they were in this together.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was a ‘fraud’, but Elder Han seemed to want to ‘slander’ him. Other than himself, were there any other good people in this Hall of Unforgivable Crimes?</p><p>When he saw that the ball had been kicked into his court, Xu Xiashou was determined that he would not be the one to take the blame.</p><p>He retreated in a panic and pointed to the sky as though he was making a vow. He explained to Rao Yaoyao nervously.,</p><p>“Sword Deity Rao is a wise person. I really have nothing to do with this Ghost Beast!”</p><p>“This Elder Han… Hmph, this d*mned Elder Han, he secretly gave me a mission just now. Even Miss Ye Xiao was not aware of this.”</p><p>“He only said that we should first escape from this place, then find a person called Xu Xiaoshou, tell him about the White Vein, the Eighth Sword Deity and lead them to this Hall of Unforgivable Crimes, then, my mission would be completed.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
