It was hard to imagine how Xu Xiaoshou learned it. This guy seemed to know all the clans. Now, everyone would believe him even if he said that he knew the language of beasts.</p><p>“There’s not much useful information, but I managed to get something about a ‘Spirit of the Heavenly Ancestor’. Do you guys know anything about it?” Xu Xiaoshou looked at the group and told them everything that had just happened.</p><p>“The Heavenly Ancestor…” Xiao Kongtong’s eyes narrowed as he mulled over this strange yet familiar term.</p><p>“One of the Ten Ancestors…I know very little about him. Well, I should say that I know almost nothing about him. Mei Siren returned the stone sword onto on his back, clutched his paper fan, and frowned. You mentioned the ‘Spirit of the Heavenly Ancestor’ and the ‘Spirit of the Abyss Island’.”</p><p>“I suspect they are the same person.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded.</p><p>The Heavenly Ancestor, the Void Giant race, the Abyss Island, the Sky City…</p><p>The conclusion drawn from this could be said to be unexpected but reasonable.</p><p>However, after they thought about it, they still found it somewhat unbelievable.</p><p>An Island that had been blessed by Spiritual Gods and still had traces of the Gods’ Imperial Decree, that floated in the Void all year round and was not involved in any fights with the world, had actually deteriorated to this point?</p><p>“Let’s split the loot first. We’ve obtained 34 Void Crystals this time.” Xu Xiaoshou saw that no one had anything to say and knew that there would be no answers to these questions no matter how much they talked about it. He took out all the 96 Void Crystals he had.</p><p>He didn’t mind sharing it. After all, after he thought about it, with Master Siren’s help, there shouldn’t be a situation where he couldn’t exchange them for the Death Exemption Token.</p><p>No matter how much Void Crystals he lacked, it was nothing more than a problem that could be solved by robbing a few more Void Attendants.</p><p>The only limitation now was whether they could find the main Hall of the First Hall of Sins within these few days.</p><p>He shared the 30 Void Crystals among the group. Xu Xiaoshou was worried about what the Void Attendant had just said.</p><p>If everyone were to lose their way in this maze at the last moment and were separated by some unknown force, then that would not prevent all the eggs to rot in the basket and cause Master Siren and Xiao Kongtong to perish due to the lack of time.</p><p>Although such an extreme situation would likely not happen, he still had to be prepared.</p><p>“Where’s mine?” Mu Zixi was in high spirits. She stared at the remaining 36 Void Crystals in Xu Xiaoshou’s hands. She felt that if it didn’t work out, she should at least get some, maybe six.</p><p>“Here.” Xu Xiaoshou took out one of the crystals and handed it over. He said calmly, “This is what Xi-er earned when we were on a mission together. I’m returning it to you.”</p><p>Xi…er?</p><p>The little girl grabbed the Void Crystal in a daze, but she was so angry at her Senior Brother’s affectionate way of addressing her.</p><p>“I’ll smash you to death!”</p><p>She angrily threw the Void Crystal at Xu Xiaoshou’s head, but with a ‘Duang’ sound, the shattered stone bounced back and left a bump on her forehead.</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>I’m so angry!</p><p>“+(Cursed. Passive Points+)+1,+1,+1,+1…</p><p>After he teased her, Xu Xiaoshou stopped fooling around and turned to Mei Siren and Xiao Kongtong. “What do we do now? Even the Void Attendant does not have any idea how to get into the main Hall.”</p><p>“Then I can only use the most primitive method…” Mei Siren glanced at the end of the ‘labyrinth path’ in the distance, then glanced at Xiao Kongtong. “Do you want to do it or shall I do it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was puzzled. What were these two talking about?</p><p>“What method?” Mu Zixi clutched her forehead as she blinked, then glared at Xu Xiaoshou. She wanted to kick him again, but Xu Xiaoshou managed to dodge her attack.</p><p>“I’ll do it.” Xiao Kongtong glanced at the girl and explained with a smile, “It’s a one at a time elimination.”</p><p>With that, the Void behind him split and turned into small Void Stilettos.</p><p>The densely packed swords had an abnormally well-proportioned beauty and were simply fatal for those with trypophobia, but were the best healing Elixirs for those with obsessive-compulsive disorders.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong pointed with his finger, and the small Void Stiletto behind him flew towards the labyrinth ahead and turned at every bend and burrowed through every crack. It sounded like a swarm of locusts that whistled their way through.</p><p>‘Ten Thousand Sword Technique… Immortals lead the way!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
