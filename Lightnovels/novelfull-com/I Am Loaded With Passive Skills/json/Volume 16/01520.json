Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even consider this, as he never had time to sleep.</p><p>Next, he would use the Holy Medicine that could repair his spirit and soul and restore his condition immediately.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou was afraid that he wouldn’t be able to withstand the impact of the medicine. He had just taken the Dragon Apricot not too long ago, so he did not want to continue taking any more pills and only used his passive skills to bear his delivery… Ptui, to split the second true body.</p><p>“I think I’m the third party?” The second true body’s appearance this time seemed a little more normal, but it also seemed like it wasn’t.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled. He understood that since he didn’t want to take the risk of getting choked by his own words, it made sense for him to be himself. So he said, “Then think again about how the other two before you died.”</p><p>“I don’t think I need to think to understand.” The second true body seemed to be a little afraid. It sneaked a glance at the main body and did not dare to be sassy and tried its best to let the main body speak.</p><p>This was a life-saving method!</p><p>It was evident that the first two had died because of their sassy remarks!</p><p>“I’m very satisfied with your attitude. At least up until now, you can read the situation and know what to say and what not to say. I think you’ll also know what to do and what not to do in the future.” Xu Xiaoshou tried to rile him up.</p><p>The third one seemed to be doing fine. At least, he didn’t want to bear the pain of splitting for the time being…Uh, the pain of splitting.</p><p>” I will. I know what you like the most. I’m just a tool. I’ll bear with it for a while. I’ll be fine.” The second true body said.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>Can’t you just keep the ‘forbearance’ stuff to yourself and not say it?</p><p>However, when he saw how the three of them couldn’t control their words, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had understood something.</p><p>Could it be that he had wrongly blamed the first two?</p><p>This ‘second true body’ was like him having a heart to heart talk with himself and it didn’t care about anything.</p><p>Or from a subjective point of view, they all thought that they were ‘me’ – I’m having a conversation with myself, so what was there to worry about?</p><p>Well, in that case, I’ll reluctantly treat you as me… Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had to put up with the other party… Oh, no, he had to put up with himself.</p><p>At this moment, he rolled his eyes and an interesting idea came into his mind.</p><p>“You, come over.” Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand. When he saw that the second true body didn’t move, he took the initiative to walk up and whispered something in his ear.</p><p>Who would have thought that the second true body would immediately take a step away and glanced at the main body with a slight disdain, as if it was very concerned about this kind of intimate action between men.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face darkened. He instantly understood the second true body’s thoughts and almost blew it up.</p><p>“Wait!” The second true body was shocked. It realized that it had overstepped its boundaries again and explained, “Just think about it. You don’t have to say it out loud. Our minds are connected. I know what you’re thinking.”</p><p>“..” Xu Xiaoshou suppressed his suicidal thoughts. This was indeed a little too painful.</p><p>“Then follow me.” He waved his hand and gestured to the second true body to follow him.</p><p>“You don’t have to say it, you just need to think about it…” The second true body subconsciously mumbled, but it soon noticed that there was a killing intent in front of it, so it immediately kept quiet and looked away and did not dare to meet his eyes.</p><p>The wooden house.</p><p>Mu Zixi spent some effort to rebuild the small wooden house that had been destroyed by the ancient trees. At this time, she was in her room and cursed as she pulled off the flower petals.</p><p>“D*mn Xu Xiaoshou, stinky Xu Xiaoshou, detestable Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>+(Cursed, Passive Points+) +1,+1,+1,+1…</p><p>Bang… Bang… Bang.</p><p>At this moment, there was a knock on the door.</p><p>The little girl’s eyes lit up. She jumped off the bench and ran to open the door. As expected, it was Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>She put her hands on her hips and said coldly, “Why are you here? Do you have a death wish?”</p><p>“I’m here to apologize,” Xu Xiaoshou’s attitude was very sincere. He bowed and said, “I’m sorry I made you angry just now. It was my fault. I won’t do it again. I promise!”</p><p>Mu Zixi was speechless.</p><p>Did the sun just rise from the West?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had learned to apologize?</p><p>Mu Zixi was touched and wanted to say “It’s all right.” This was what she expected from her good Senior Brother!</p><p>Who would have thought that after Xu Xiaoshou was done with his apology, he moved away from the wooden door, stuck his hand to the side, and said fiercely, “You come over and apologize too. It’s all your fault!”</p><p>Mu Zixi looked on in a daze and did not understand what was going on.</p><p>In the next second, she saw Xu Xiaoshou pull over another Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>What in the blazes was going on… The little girl’s lips immediately formed an ‘O’ shape, and her God Devil Eyes opened wide. In the end, the second Xu Xiaoshou she saw was not the portrait clone she had imagined, but the real person!</p><p>It’s real, it’s real, he was identical to the first Xu Xiaoshou, a real person without any difference at all!</p><p>+(Suspected. Passive Points+) +1.</p><p>The second Xu Xiaoshou was dragged along by the ear. He bowed and apologized sincerely, “I’m sorry I made you angry just now. Actually, it was all my fault. If you want to blame someone, blame me. If you want to kill me, you can do it.”</p><p>Mu Zixi was speechless.</p><p>What in the world…was going on…?</p><p>Her little face was dazed and full of shock. Her eyes moved back and forth between the first and second Xu Xiaoshou, and even the God Devil Eyes couldn’t tell the difference between the real and the fake. So, Xu Xiaoshou actually had a twin brother?</p><p>At this time, the two Xu Xiaoshou saw that their little Junior Sister couldn’t even distinguish who they were, even with her God Devil Eyes. They laughed, put their hands in their pockets, and scattered the petals in front of them.</p><p>“Surprise!!!”</p><p>The two evil guys bent down at the same time, grinned at the same time, and moved closer to Mu Zixi at the same time. Then, they revealed the exact same creepy expression and action that made one’s hair stand on end.</p><p>“Hahaha, you did not expect this, right? I’ve split up!”</p><p>With a thump, Mu Zixi was so frightened that she fell backward onto her butt to the ground. Her face was pale and she scrambled backward as if she had seen a demon.</p><p>Then, she realized that this was another prank by Xu Xiaoshou. Her face turned red with anger. She grabbed the Buddha Slaying Blade and the Empty Hell Magic Staff and rushed forward as she shrieked in anger.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I’m going to kill you…”</p><p>+(Cursed, Passive Points+) 1,+1,+1,+1…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
