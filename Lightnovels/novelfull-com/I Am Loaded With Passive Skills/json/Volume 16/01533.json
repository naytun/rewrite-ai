No one could find him. It was as if he’ became a passerby in the world of mortals; he came and went when it suited him.”</p><p>Came and went when it suited him…</p><p>It had to be said that this description suited the Kong Yuhen that Xu Xiaoshou met in the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion, perfectly.</p><p>The ‘forgotten worries’, the ‘friend’ and the ‘many things without a reason’ that he said could be done just because he wanted to. Xu Xiaoshou felt that it was incredible and envied him.</p><p>Regardless whether this was fake or not, this realm was indeed what Xu Xiaoshou was after.</p><p>However, his current strength and the environment he was in didn’t allow him to be as detached like Kong Yuhen.</p><p>Anxiety… was normal!</p><p>It was impossible for anyone in his current position not to be suspicious about the motives behind everything. How could he not be anxious?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gripped the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff that switched between reality and illusion in his hands, and the anxiety in his heart grew.</p><p>He quickly recounted his encounter to the three of them and asked in confusion, “I still don’t understand why he would give me this. This was one of the top 10 Great Psionic Weapons. I think he might have an ulterior motive.”</p><p>Mei Siren frowned and pondered for a while. After a long while, he said, “What level do you personally think he is at now?”</p><p>“Combat level?” Xu Xiaoshou tilted his head and thought for a while. He felt that the combination of time and space attributes and Kong Yuhen’s ability to make use of these two abilities were simply unparalleled.</p><p>“I didn’t sense any Holy Power fluctuation from him, but I think even if he’s not a Demi-Saint, the one from the Jiang clan can’t beat him.”</p><p>“Yes…” After a pause, Xu Xiaoshou felt that this was a little exaggerated and that some factors were missing. He immediately added, “At least, in his All Time Forgotten Pavilion, in his territory, a Demi-Saint should not be able to defeat him…Yes, that ‘s just my intuition.”</p><p>“Just because you didn’t sense any Holy Power doesn’t mean he’s not a Demi-Saint. ” Xiao Kongtong said in a low voice. “There could be another explanation. He’s passed the Demi-Saint’s four tribulations, and his strength is close to that of a Holy Emperor. Perhaps he’s already a Holy Emperor.”</p><p>“What?” Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. “That terrifying?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong stared at him for a long while before he chuckled and said.</p><p>“Don’t doubt the geniuses of the previous generation, Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>‘More than half of the Ten High Nobles back then should have reached this level by now…In other words, he may not have not made a breakthrough in his cultivation level due to subjective and objective reasons, but his combat strength is definitely at the Demi-Saint stage.”</p><p>“And with space…That person’s space attribute is already extremely strange, so it’s hard to tell what level he’s at now.”</p><p>At this point, Xiao Kongtong frowned and turned toward Mei Siren. “Master Siren, in your impression of Kong…what is his attribute?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed when he saw how Xiao Kongtong didn’t even dare to use his full name. He felt that he had really courted death when he uttered Kong Yuhen’s full name so many times just now. He couldn’t say what he wanted to say here, in case he overheard.</p><p>“Time.” Mei Siren said with great certainty after he glanced at the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff.</p><p>“But I remember that he had the space attributes? ” Xiao Kongtong was stunned for a moment and his hair stood on end before he said, “In your impression, he really had the time attribute?”</p><p>“I am certain he has.” Mei Siren nodded.</p><p>“This seems to have given me the answer that I don’t want to know at all…” Xiao Kongtong suddenly fell silent and did not speak anymore.</p><p>“Ah, this… Mu Zixi bit her finger.</p><p>What, why were everyone’s memories so messed up?</p><p>Time was time, and space was space. How could they be confused?</p><p>Didn’t Xu Xiaoshou just say that Kong Yuhen had a dual attribute of time and space?</p><p>“You…”</p><p>As soon as the little girl turned her head, Xu Xiaoshou, with a look of horror in his eyes said, “I’m sure he had both time and space attributes!”</p><p>Mu Zixi suddenly shivered and cowered among the three of them. Only then did she feel a little safe.</p><p>“Space time…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly thought of Huang Quan.</p><p>This Yama boss also seemed to have the space-time dual-attributes.</p><p>“Could it be the same person? Time and space are so rare. It’s impossible for two people to have these two attributes in the world, right?” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t say who it was, but Mei Siren seemed to know what he meant.</p><p>“According to what you said, that person’s temperament is not like Yama Huang Quan. He is very open-minded…Mei Siren flapped his paper fan and pondered on this. “What did you say about his appearance just now?”</p><p>“Scholar. He’s very handsome.” Xu Xiaoshou said without thinking. “He’s dressed like a wealthy scholar in a luxurious outfit, and his temperament…Hmm, it’s a good match, it feels like he’s a learned man.”</p><p>“I have actually forgotten what the appearance and temperament of the previous Ten High Nobles were like. But I vaguely recall that among the ten people inside, there is absolutely no one with the appearance and temperament you described.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt that this world was quite scary.</p><p>Even Master Siren had forgotten what Kong Yuhen looked like?</p><p>Didn’t this mean that the face under Huang Quan’s mask might really be that of Kong Yuhen? After all, it had both the time and space attributes. How could there be such a coincidence in this world?</p><p>But…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at his little Junior Sister and felt very uneasy.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
