(1)</p><p>D*mn…d*mn…d*mn!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he would not be able to sleep for a long time.</p><p>He originally felt that his battle of wits and courage with the air was already extremely off the mark. This was an action that could only be done by someone who was so cautious that it was slightly abnormal.</p><p>However, he had never thought that even this seemingly frivolous self-verification would really prove something to himself.</p><p>“Someone is watching me!”</p><p>Ye Xiao?</p><p>There was a 99% chance that it was Ye Xiaol!</p><p>The only one left could be Kong Yuhen…No, it was definitely not Kong Yuhen!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was almost certain that it was the dangerous woman he had not been able to wait for after he escaped from the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes, and not Kong Yuhen.</p><p>Even if it was Yul Lingdi or Bazhun’an, Gou Wuyue or Rao Yaoyao, they would at least ‘notify’ the person beforehand and cause the Information Bar to issue a warning.</p><p>However, the way this Dark Division Chief stalked a person…</p><p>She didn’t even stalk him; she just followed him like a tarsal maggot, a malignant growth!</p><p>If it had not been for the fact that he had startled her when he washed his face and attracted her attention slightly, Xu Xiaoshou would have inadvertently shown his true identity and the price to pay for that would be high.</p><p>A real killer would never reveal any killing intent before the dagger was inserted into the target’s neck.</p><p>A mature hunter would never believe in any opportunity that could speed up the hunting operation before the prey closed its eyes and breathed its last.</p><p>Without a doubt, Ye Xiao was such a person!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t believe that he had pretended to be weak for so long…If it was Rao Yaoyao, she would have already slashed out with her sword. Who would be able to resist the temptation?</p><p>But Ye Xiao could!</p><p>Her endurance limit was so strong that she didn’t even take advantage of the various flaws and opportunities that were presented to her just now. She just followed her own hunting instinct and just watched silently.</p><p>“Was it because of what I said in the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. He felt that the plan he had made in the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes was just mediocre. Why did Ye Xiao have such a high opinion of Chen Tan?</p><p>No matter what, Xu Xiaoshou had labeled Ye Xiao as the most dangerous hunter.</p><p>He realized that the fear he had for this higher void was even greater than when he faced Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi, Elder Han and Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>“Ka ka!”</p><p>As these thoughts ran through his mind, Xu Xiaoshou looked into the bronze mirror and quickly pinched his face. His bones cracked audibly as his skin and flesh underwent a Transformation.</p><p>When he saw the notification on the Information Bar, he froze for a moment, but he managed to cover it up as he thought about whose image he would borrow.</p><p>He believed that Ye Xiao’s ‘shock’ at that moment meant that she was also frightened. In her moment of distraction, she should not have been able to see through his disguise.</p><p>No matter what, Xu Xiaoshou followed Chen Tan’s idea and quickly transformed himself into a jade-faced scholar.</p><p>This face was very delicate with a fair and smooth complexion and looked very weak, but his eyes were bright and his temperament was refined and gave the impression that he was well read and knowledgeable.</p><p>However, in the First Hall of Sins, most people valued martial arts over knowledge.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face, when compared to the people here, should be considered very ordinary.</p><p>However…</p><p>This was Kong Yuhen’s face!</p><p>After he pinched his face and put down the bronze mirror, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t take out the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff. He just glanced imperceptibly at the Information Bar.There was no response.</p><p>“So Ye Xiao had never seen Kong Yuhen before?”</p><p>“Well, it’s also possible that she’s seen it before. She knows this face, but she didn’t dare to show any reaction after she exposed her ‘horror’ earlier…”</p><p>“No! Absolutely not! Anyone who has seen Kong Yuhen before can’t remain calm after they see my face. This should be even more terrifying than a faceless man without any facial features!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickly realized that Ye Xiao definitely did not know who Kong Yuhen was.</p><p>Otherwise, the face of the most mysterious person among the Ten High Nobles, who had mastered the Time and Space attributes, had appeared on the body of a Southern Region heretic practitioner. How could this not be shocking?</p><p>Not to mention Ye Xiao, even Dao Qiongcang would definitely be surprised if he came!</p><p>In the labyrinth of the First Hall of Sins, the fog remained and the place was dark.</p><p>From time to time, there would be a big explosion in the distance. Occasionally, the aftermath of the battle would break the walls of the labyrinth and froze everything there. Then, it would be torn apart by the Sword Will, but it seemed that it did not affect this place.</p><p>The Saint Calamity was already very far away. No one knew where the battlefield had gone.</p><p>Chen Tan seemed to like his new face very much.</p><p>After everything was done, he patted his cheeks with both hands and pinched the flesh on his cheeks. He tugged and then released them and watched the flesh bounce back in place</p><p>“Very good. Next, I’ll be called ‘Chen Ruye’.”</p><p>Chen Ruye also seemed not to be aware of anything. He muttered to himself, looked up at the sky, and then randomly chose a direction to start running to.</p><p>Time was life.</p><p>There were only two ways to save himself.</p><p>First, under the premise of finding the main hall of the First Hall of Sins, find your own people, such as Master Siren and Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>Second, under the same premise, as long as the person you meet is not one of your own, you can use an external force to divert Ye Xiao’s attention. For example, the person you meet by chance is Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was Ye Xiao’s lifelong enemy!</p><p>Ye Xiao knew this and so did Chen Ruye. Xu Xiaoshou could be anyone, because he had the Imitator.</p><p>The second method was extremely difficult to achieve, but Chen Ruye also knew that it wasn’t impossible to make an innocent and lucky person turn into Xu Xiaoshou.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
