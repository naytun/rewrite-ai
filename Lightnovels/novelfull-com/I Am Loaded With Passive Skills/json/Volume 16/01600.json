Passive Points), +1.”</p><p>In the dark labyrinth, Xu Xiaoshou stared at the message that popped up in the Information Bar and he could not speak for a long time.</p><p>This was not the first time he had received the ‘care’ from the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>After this guy had caught up to him and crushed the space-time golden talisman, he had thought that he was here to deal with Chen Ruye. Only later did he realize that he was here to help him get rid of Ye Xiao.</p><p>If there was an explanation, it could only be due to the close relationship between Yama and Xu Yue Grey Palace…</p><p>So, what about now?</p><p>“Protection…”</p><p>As he leaned against the wall of the labyrinth, Xu Xiaoshou frowned and subconsciously said it out loud.</p><p>Even the system had given a clear affirmation that the various actions of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man were indeed ‘protection’ and not ‘exploitation’ with ulterior motives.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Even if Yama and the Xu Yue Grey Palace had a profound relationship that could not be revealed, there was no need for the Five Decays of Heaven and Man to take such good care of an ordinary member of another faction, right?</p><p>What’s more, Xu Xiaoshou felt that Five Decays of Heaven and Man had already known that he was not a true member of the Xu Yue Grey Palace!</p><p>“If he knew that I’m Xu Xiaoshou, would he still be so nice to me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his chin. In his mind, the images of Elder Sang and then Master Siren flashed by, then there was nothing else.</p><p>Even the care that Bazhun’an had given him was a bit exploitative. In this world now, besides Elder Sang and Master Siren, were there any other good and pure people?</p><p>“Could it be that he is my… Uh, the original owner’s father?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked by his own imagination, but he quickly denied this possibility.</p><p>They died long ago.</p><p>Both his parents were dead.</p><p>This body had no blood relatives.</p><p>Furthermore, ever since he had embarked on the path of Spiritual Cultivation, ordinary people and Spiritual Cultivators, as well as the mortal world and the world of Spiritual Cultivation were two completely different worlds.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou searched through his memory to see if there was such a similar person in his impression. Could the Five Decays of Heaven and Man have been one of his seniors in the Spirit Palace, the Holy Palace, or a Saint Servant?</p><p>This was his usual trick.</p><p>The result was obvious. He couldn’t find any.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was unique and too iconic.</p><p>This was completely different from the Ancient Sword Technique. The Ancient Sword Technique could be imitated, but the power of decay was probably the only one in the Spiritual Cultivation world.</p><p>Just like Feng Yujin, who had the Seal Attribute, the power of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man could not be replicated unless someone had the Imitator.</p><p>But this was not sheer nonsense!</p><p>He had the Imitator in his body…</p><p>“This is a good thing. In terms of the result, I have one more ally.”</p><p>“He should be a good friend of Bazhun’an. Anyway, whatever I don’t understand would always be related to Bazhun’an.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried to psych himself in order to forget about the unpredictable turn of events and focus solely on the results.</p><p>In the end, he found that he couldn’t bear this kind of unknown ‘care’. If he was really Bazhun’an’s man, there was no need to be so secretive.</p><p>If he didn’t figure this out, what if this ‘care’ became a ‘backstab’ one day, that would directly or indirectly lead to his death?</p><p>“You, get ready!”</p><p>In the Yuan Mansion, the second true body was currently fishing for poisonous fish. When it received the notification, it stood up abruptly with a reluctant look on its face. “What for?”</p><p>“You know how to use the Vanishing Technique; why are you sitting around fishing the whole day, what sort of skill is that? I’ll give you a mission. Follow the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and Ye Xiao. If one of them dies in the end, I want you make sure you personally witnessed that person’s death.”</p><p>“You don’t have to tell me, I know what you’re thinking…”</p><p>“Then why are you still asking?”</p><p>“You should understand what I mean. I don’t want to go…”</p><p>“I don’t care if you want to or not!” Xu Xiaoshou was furious and immediately ordered, “Get lost! What was the point of creating you? Was it to let you slack off… Oh, I’m the one who created the Yuan Mansion and you’re the one to enjoy it?”</p><p>The passageway to the Yuan Mansion split open.</p><p>There seemed to be something that came out, but then again, it seemed there was nothing.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the space in front of him. He and the true body shared a vision, even if the second true body used the Vanishing Technique.</p><p>In other words, if the second true body managed to go where the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and Ye Xiao had their battle, he would be able to witness the battle from a first-person perspective.</p><p>Of course, there would definitely be some surprises during the course of the battle…</p><p>“Never touch the Vanishing Technique! You’re not me. You only have one mission-to watch the show. Don’t add any more scenes for yourself.” Xu Xiaoshou issued this order to himself silently and the second true body could hear it.</p><p>The second true body had inherited all of his abilities, but there were some things that could not be inherited.</p><p>For example, the Infernal Original Seed and the Three Days Frozen Calamity… Oh, Xiao Kongtong’s Sword Cognition, his Holy Blood and all sorts of treasures.</p><p>The treasures included the Fourth Sword, the Flame Python, the Imitator and so on.</p><p>The second true body couldn’t duplicate anything that was external.</p><p>This was in accordance with the law of conservation of energy. Otherwise, Xu Xiaoshou could have mass-produced the Fourth Sword by himself, and even skip the forging process.</p><p>“What if I’m discovered? You know, the Vanishing Technique is not omnipotent. The Holy Realm and the Storyteller can target it. Even Ye Xiao could detect the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s decrepit phenomena, so how can she not locate you… Uh, me?” The second true body’s inner voice sounded.</p><p>“Run if you’re discovered.” Xu Xiaoshou sneered and thought, “How did my split self have a personality that’s afraid of death; that’s so unlike me?”</p><p>“What if you can’t run?”</p><p>“If you can’t run, just kill yourself. I can still create another, anyway. You just have to avoid being caught and get dissected for research purposes.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
