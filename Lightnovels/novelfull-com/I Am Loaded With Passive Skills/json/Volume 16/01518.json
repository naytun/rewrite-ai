After a long time, he said, “You, what do you know?”</p><p>“Whatever you know, I do too.” The second true body said with a smile.</p><p>“How much?”</p><p>“100%.”</p><p>“Any passive skills?”</p><p>“I have.”</p><p>“Thinking?”</p><p>“If I want to, I can think.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a sense of horror for no reason. It was the fear of the unknown and what he could not control. He immediately asked, “Then what’s the difference between you and me?”</p><p>“There’s the biggest difference. You’re the true body and I’m the second true body.” The mirror image clone of Xu Xiaoshou said.</p><p>“The second true body…” Xu Xiaoshou pondered. “It’s not a clone, nor a Demi-saint’s incarnation, but a second true body. It inherited all my abilities, not only my combat abilities, but also my thoughts. It’s like another me.”</p><p>Then, what if it yearned for freedom?</p><p>“I have a question.” Xu Xiaoshou raised his head and asked. His eyes were cold and terrifying.</p><p>“Please speak.” The second true body was very polite, as if it had not noticed anything.</p><p>“After all, I’m the only one and you’re the second. You and I are not equal. Is that right?”</p><p>“Yes, that’s right.”</p><p>“If that’s the case, then it’s not a matter of there being two tigers on one mountain, but a matter of ruler and subject, right?”</p><p>Without waiting for the second true body to reply, Xu Xiaoshou continued, “Since it’s a discussion between the ruler and his subject, then if the ruler wanted his subject to die, what should the next sentence be?”</p><p>The second true body’s face stiffened, as if he had understood something. His lips suddenly turned white, and he said hesitantly, “I… I am a commoner?”</p><p>You brat really have some of my style!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost spat out blood.</p><p>He did not hesitate and directly hurled Hidden Bitter at him, like a judge who had issued an Imperial Decree. Then he said indifferently, “Kill yourself!”</p><p>“Sir. Please spare me…” The second true body knelt on the ground with a thud, and his hand inadvertently touched Hidden Bitter, who suddenly became so excited that he wriggled non-stop.</p><p>“I know what you’re thinking, but there’s no need for that. If you want me to die, just one thought from you will do. You said it yourself, you’re the only one, and I’m the second. I won’t go against your will. The second true body trembled as it placed Hidden Bitter across its neck. It seemed it could not disobey Xu Xiaoshou’s orders.</p><p>“Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…”</p><p>Hidden Bitter’s sword body twisted wildly. It seemed to kick the air with its feet and aimed for its owner’s artery with its sharpest side – this seemed to be its dream.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the scene coldly like a god from the clouds. He said indifferently, “I’m sorry, but I have to test an idea, so you have to die once.”</p><p>The second true body teared up, and it tried its best to swerve backward to avoid the blade, but unintentionally, it drew closer and closer to Hidden Bitter.</p><p>He said sorrowfully, “Even so, you can just blow me up. Why do you have to let this broken sword taste the sweetness? You can’t let it activate this Owner devouring ring!”</p><p>“When a person is about to die, his words are also kind.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded, as he acknowledged the second true body’s last words. He retracted Hidden Bitter despite its resistance and indicated with his eyes, “Then you can die now. Blow yourself up!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Blood and flesh scattered everywhere, the air currents surged, and the second true body died on the spot.</p><p>“D*mn!!!”</p><p>At the same time, Xu Xiaoshou was in so much pain that he curled up like a shrimp, held his head and smacked it against the ground.</p><p>The so-called second true body was, after all, half of his body. When it died, its physical body, spirit, and soul were also destroyed.</p><p>This was akin to Xu Xiaoshou cutting himself in half. How could it not hurt?</p><p>When he faced Jiang Buyi before and had to cut off one of his arms to survive, he was in so much pain – not only the physical pain, but also the pain when he had to cut off his own arm!</p><p>This feeling was such that you could bear to be cut by the enemy’s knife, but you couldn’t get over it psychologically if you had to hurt yourself.</p><p>However, this experiment also allowed Xu Xiaoshou to confirm the definition of a ‘second true body’.</p><p>“The second true body can perfectly copy all the abilities of the main body, passive skills included. It also contained another ‘self’. In addition to being controlled by the ‘self’, it had its own ‘spiritual intelligence’.”</p><p>“But it will not transcend my ‘self’ or even harm my ‘self’, because it must accept the orders of my ‘self’, or in other words, me.”</p><p>Therefore, it will not become another ‘me’ but a ‘tool’, a perfect tool!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a long time to recover from the pain.</p><p>After he understood the true meaning of the ‘second true body’, the pleasure he felt was more than the comfort he felt after the pain.</p><p>“Since it can’t become another ‘me’, then the ‘second true body’ is undoubtedly a divine skill!”</p><p>“If I had this second true body in the Spirit Gem Trade Fair, I might not even need to ask Bazhun’an for help. If there’s a second true body in the Yunlun Mountain Range, Xu Xiaoqi need not even make an appearance.”</p><p>“Even when I face the Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi, I do not need to cut off one of my arms. I could use my second true body to simulate a more realistic death. I could play with the old Demi-Saint and even trick him again. After all, I am not afraid of death. Only my second true body would die.”</p><p>“What’s more, in the future, Young Master Xu, Xu Deye, the Demi-Saint descendant of the Taixiang Xu family in the Northern Region. will be able to confront Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou at the same time. From the previous concealment to the present ability to create something out of nothing…The Xu family of the Northern Region, grow bigger and stronger!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
