Hatred was not the only thing in life, and pursuing happiness was what everyone should do.</p><p>Su Qianqian vaguely remembered from the pearl of inheritance she saw her grandfather have a genuine and blissful smile in the Second World.</p><p>On the other hand..</p><p>Su Qianqian knew that if her grandpa had been still alive, he would have wanted to see her in her Second World filled with loneliness.</p><p>There was nothing but hatred in this world!</p><p>“But, other than hatred, what else can I have…”</p><p>Su Qianqian saw the Epitaph of City Snow in her arms suddenly disappear, and the corpse of her enemy under her feet disintegrated into starlight. She looked around helplessly, trying to catch something but couldn’t.</p><p>At this moment, she heard something.</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>A silly laugh entered Su Qianqian’s ears, and she woke up. The world in front of her had fallen apart, and she returned to the Eighth Dragon Range.</p><p>“What… what did I just experience?”</p><p>Su Qianqian was confused, for she felt like she had a spiritual journey but didn’t know how.</p><p>She turned around and saw Gu Qingsan sprawling on a large rock with a silly smile on his face. Apparently, he still hadn’t woken up.</p><p>“Second World?”</p><p>Su Qianqian thought of something and suddenly looked up into the sky.</p><p>However, there was nothing in the sky. Not only the sword light but even Sky City was gone!</p><p>“Third Senior Brother! Third Senior Brother!”</p><p>Su Qianqian shook her third senior brother’s body.</p><p>However, Gu Qingsan was still giggling, stuck in his Second World.</p><p>To die in something greater, to live forever in an endless sin… Su Qianqian suddenly thought of the Upanishad of the Second World and was a little flustered.</p><p>At this moment, Gu Qingsan was still giggling.</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>“Gu Qingyi, Gu Qingyi, it;s your turn now! Write the Sword Sutra ten thousand times! Come on! Move your ass!”</p><p>“And you, Gu Qinger! How does it feel to be defeated by a single sword strike? Are you sad? Hahahaha…”</p><p>“Wen Ting! Hahaha, bastard Wen Ting, I’ve wanted to defeat you for a long time. Tell me, Swordless Sword Technique is the best, right? Hahaha…” Gu Qingsan was with left arms akimbo.</p><p>Hearing Gu Qingsan’s words and seeing him moving, Su Qianqian was stunned.</p><p>He was alive!</p><p>He wasn’t dead yet!</p><p>But..</p><p>“Third Senior Brother, what are you dreaming about?” she thought.</p><p>Also, how dare he call Supreme Master by his name?</p><p>“Slap!”</p><p>Everyone disappeared.</p><p>Gu Qingsan suddenly felt his left face become red and swollen as if someone had slapped him hard. The next second, he woke up.</p><p>“What the… Supreme Master, why did you slap me?”</p><p>Gu Qingsan looked around. In the dream, Supreme Master appeared and slapped him hard.</p><p>However, he didn’t see where Supreme Master was after waking up.</p><p>Suddenly, Gu Qingsan came back to his senses and looked up into the sky.</p><p>“Second World?”</p><p>“That was… Second World? Who attacked me then?”</p><p>Lowering his head, Gu Qingsan saw Su Qianqian’s adorable face. At this moment, who slapped him in his dream was no longer important.</p><p>He was dumbfounded. “Qian… Su Qianqian? Did you wake up before me? You… you didn’t hear anything, did you?”</p><p>Su Qianqian stared blankly at her third senior brother. Suddenly, she understood what her grandfather meant by “somewhere greater,” covered her mouth, and burst out laughing.</p><p>“Third senior brother, I heard everything.”</p><p>Gu Qingsan covered his swollen face and was dumbfounded.</p><p>..</p><p>Water Ghost and Cen Qiaofu quickly soon woke up in Lone Cliff’s ruins. Then, they looked at Xiu Yuanke, who was able to affect them with the aftershock of the sword attack.</p><p>“Did… did this guy just do it?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu could not believe the guy who could only imitate him and was trapped by Water Ghost’s water ball had just performed a stunning sword strike.</p><p>However, he didn’t have much time to think about this matter.</p><p>“Thud!”</p><p>After Xiu Yuanke, Bazhun’an also fell to the ground.</p><p>“Oh no…”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu panicked, moved over, and held Bazhun’an.</p><p>“Cough, cough, I’m fine… Cough!”</p><p>Bazhun’an coughed up blood that stained his entire face and pointed at Xiu Yuanke with his trembling finger. “Go to check on him!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu was speechless.</p><p>Was he fine?</p><p>If Bazhun’an kept acting recklessly, he might lose him!</p><p>After putting a pill in Bazhun’an’s mouth, Cen Qiaofu quickly put him down and turned to the other side. Then, he pinched the arm of Xiu Yuanke, whose whole body was cracked and covered in blood.</p><p>“He’s dead.”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu sighed.</p><p>As expected, that slash was the most glorious moment of his life.</p><p>It would have been a miracle if he had survived!</p><p>“He’s dead?”</p><p>Bazhun’an was stunned and raised his voice. “He shouldn’t be! He hid his sword for more than ten years, so he should be able to survive…”</p><p>At this moment, Water Ghost went forward, checked Xiu Yuanke’s breath, and touched his chest.</p><p>“He is not breathing anymore, and his heartbeat has stopped…” he calmly stated, but something suddenly came to his mind. He stretched out his hand to touch Xiu Yuanke’s neck.</p><p>It seemed that he could slightly feel a pulse in his artery.</p><p>Water Ghost sighed in relief and said, “He’s still alive but very weak. In this state, he’ll probably never wake up. Let me be a living corpse.”</p><p>“He’s still barely awake…” Bazhun’an sighed as he listened, but he still had hope. “As a spellcaster, he’s just stuck in his Second World. He will wake up when he can.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
