(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio  Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Everyone was silent.</p><p>God of Killing, Wei Feng’s mouth twitched and he said unhappily, “Then can Elder Yan explain to everyone?”</p><p>“Hehehe…” Yan Wuse’s expression changed and he sat back in his high-back chair.</p><p>Explain?</p><p>What a joke!</p><p>He had only held a few meetings and concluded that “White is the norm”, “Gold is an opportunity”, and “Red is a vicious divination”.</p><p>If they really wanted to discuss the details…</p><p>Was this something that humans could play with?</p><p>Who could understand it?</p><p>“If you don’t understand, don’t babble.”</p><p>God of Killing, Wei Feng, berated again before everyone turned their gazes back to Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang glanced at the divine Sinan and then turned his gaze to the people at the round table and said.</p><p>“What I deduce is a little complicated. Let’s talk one by one.</p><p>“Firstly, the water-attribute five elements naturally refers to the situation at the Lone Cliff. It is really set up by the Water-type Upanishad.</p><p>“Combining it with the heavenly stem, it is the speculation on the demi-saint that everyone is focusing on… To be honest, the Holy Divine Palace didn’t convey any message to me that the demi-saint is involved in this situation.”</p><p>“But with the heavenly stem and water in the north, it’s not hard to see that the demi-saint who acted on his own can investigate the northern region.</p><p>“Heavenly stem is highly compatible with water. We don’t talk about coincidences in the divine deduction. We only talk about guidance. That means this demi-saint and the Water-type Upanishad controller should still be in contact, or in other words, they collude with one another…”</p><p>Yan Wuse interrupted in shock, “Has he gone mad?”</p><p>A demi-saint of the Northern Region? If someone from the Demi-Saint Family acted on his own outside the Holy Divine Palace, everyone knew what that meant.</p><p>Furthermore, Dao Qiongcang also said that this demi-saint and the Water-type Upanishad controller had a conspiracy…</p><p>The latter was an enemy!</p><p>Wouldn’t the actions of the demi-saint lead to his own death?</p><p>“Noisy!”</p><p>Finally, Elder Yu couldn’t take it anymore. He used his fishing rod to give Yan Wuse a violent blow and looked at Dao Qiongcang with a hint of surprise in his eyes. “Continue.”</p><p>This human kid was amazing!</p><p>He was able to obtain so much information with just this broken Sinan?</p><p>What was the difference between this and the master of the Way of the Heavens?</p><p>Was Divine Secret really that powerful?</p><p>on the spur of the moment, Elder Yu once again had the thought of learning the Divine Secret. But again he quickly let go of the urge.</p><p>Even humans couldn’t learn this thing, let alone a race that wasn’t known for intelligence.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang paused and said again.</p><p>“The eight doors ended between the deaths and injuries. What Senior Yan said is right. This is a bad omen. It’s either death or injury.</p><p>“There’s intervention from a demi-saint and it’s such a bad omen. It means the pressure is great at Rao Yaoyao’s end. One person is not able to withstand it.</p><p>“Perhaps among you seniors, you do need to make a few moves now.</p><p>“As for the lines…</p><p>“Hold on!” Before Dao Qiongcang could finish his sentence, the spiritual physique of the Nine Sacrifices interrupted him. His beautiful eyes were filled with surprise. “When you said that Rao Yaoyao wasn’t able to attend the meeting, you were actually saying that she was involved in the operation in the Eastern Region?”</p><p>“Yes, she was in charge.” Dao Qiongcang looked over.”What’s the problem?”</p><p>Nine Sacrifices fell into silence for a long time and said, “Isn’t she the same as Wuyue, not yet a demi-saint?”</p><p>“Yes.” Dao Qiongcang nodded.</p><p>Even a demi-saint would find it hard to move.</p><p>Therefore, among the Ten-member Council, the only two rulers who needed to make big moves were at the higher void level.</p><p>They were Gou Wuyue and Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>If they would not do anything, who would?</p><p>“Did you predict a vicious divination?” Nine Sacrifices looked at the blood-red light on the divine Sinan, feeling puzzled, and asked.</p><p>“Yes, I did.” Dao Qiongcang nodded.</p><p>“Then why did you let her go? She’s just a kid…” Nine Sacrifices became anxious.</p><p>The key was Rao Yaoyao was not just a kid. Her ability and experience were not enough to take charge of the situation.</p><p>Her surname was Rao. Her cultivation level had yet to reach the higher void level. How could she be sent to carry out such an important operation?</p><p>And even demi-saint was involved.</p><p>She could not have a demi-saint following her…</p><p>Dao Qiongcang knew what Lord Nine Sacrifices was thinking. He smiled and said, “That’s why I approved the Cang Godhood Sword to go out. With Xuan Cang around, nothing will happen to her.”</p><p>“This…” Lord Nine Sacrifices was still worried.</p><p>“Lord Nine Sacrifices must have worried too much. What you could think of, this kid must have already thought of it. There must be a reason why he dared to do this.” Elder Yu couldn’t care less and looked at Dao Qiongcang. “Right?”</p><p>Everyone turned their gazes over again. Dao Qiongcang sighed and smiled before nodding his head.</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao is lacking in tempering. This time, she will have to face the arrangement by Bazhun’an and others alone. It is naturally the best form of training.</p><p>“If she succeeds in the operation this time, with her firm and steadfast mind, it will be of great benefit to her cultivation and growth. In the future, she will be able to take a step further and take charge of a larger operation.”</p><p>“What if she fails?” Nine Sacrifices asked.</p><p>How could he not know the worth of the little girl who had surrounded him since she was young? The girl who liked to break twigs and practice swordsmanship, and eat a bite of osmanthus cake when she was hungry?</p><p>Against Bazhun’an, it was still fine if Dao Qiongcang went along.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao?</p><p>Wouldn’t she be fooled?</p><p>“It’s even better if she fails.” The corners of Dao Qiongcang’s lips curled up. “I also expect her to fail. After being defeated, and realizing she is useless, she will specialize in the Way of the Sword. Perhaps the demi-saint is just around the corner.”</p><p>Everyone was speechless.</p><p>From the beginning, he had deduced till death!</p><p>“As expected of you!” thought everyone.</p><p>Nine Sacrifices was speechless. For a moment, he didn’t know what to say.</p><p>Elder Yu clicked his tongue. He felt that this kid was a fox that had turned into a demon. His schemes were simply ridiculous. He could reasonably explain both the good and the bad.</p><p>“Aren’t you afraid of causing her death?” He raised his eyebrows and asked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
