It was as if the Holy Emperor was fighting, and ordinary people were not allowed to get close.</p><p>At the same time, in the bushes by the side.</p><p>Amidst rustling sounds, a one-armed crippled old man who carried a large mahogany box on his back and a ‘Thousand Paper Crane’ in his palm, appeared. As he walked in by himself, he asked in a doubtful voice, “Where is Eldest Senior Brother?”</p><p>“Why can’t I lock onto Eldest Senior Brother’s location?”</p><p>“Wasn’t it said that no matter where you were in this world, you can locate him through this ‘Thousand Paper Crane’?”</p><p>Xiu Yuanke sighed.</p><p>He had been frightened by a few Gold Hunting Token killers in Dongtianwang City, so he had been delayed for a while. How come he could not keep up with Eldest Senior Brother’s pace?</p><p>He had clearly said that he would wait for him…</p><p>Suddenly!</p><p>Xiu Yuanke’s footsteps came to a stop, and he saw three figures on the cliff some distance away.</p><p>The person in the lead had a very prominent image.</p><p>From the side, Xiu Yuanke could see his eight fingers slowly dancing on the Golden Scroll. Then, when he focused his eyes, he saw that the person who was writing something had a prominent sword scar on his neck…</p><p>“Eldest Senior Brother!”</p><p>Xiu Yuanke was pleasantly surprised.</p><p>“Was this Eldest Senior Brother’s disguise, pretending to be Bazhun’an?”</p><p>” Wait, where was his sack?”</p><p>That was not important!</p><p>What was important was that after searching for so long, Xiu Yuanke finally found Eldest Senior Brother, Xiao Kongtong. He leaped over and cried out.</p><p>“Eldest Senior Brother, I’ve had a hard time looking for you. What are you doing…”</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence.</p><p>Xiu Yuanke’s pouncing figure stopped in mid-air as if he had hit a barrier. He fell rapidly and crashed into the mountain with a bang.</p><p>Water Ghost and Cen Qiaofu had obviously noticed this uninvited guest and looked over at the same time.</p><p>“What kind of game is this?”</p><p>Xiu Yuanke was stunned.</p><p>He did not recognize the guy with the Golden Beast Mask on his head.</p><p>But Cen Qiaofu’s appearance…</p><p>“I’m familiar with that!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
