There was a murderous intent in Lei Xi’er’s eyes.</p><p>“I understand.”</p><p>“I hope you really understand…” Xu Xiaoshou watched this transformation and thought to himself, “I didn’t let you out to send you to your death.”</p><p>However, the person standing in front of him was Lei Xi’er, not Mu Zixi. Xu Xiaoshou also knew that this girl had made her own decision.</p><p>He didn’t want to interfere too much with Lei Xi’er’s thoughts. After Lei Xi’er calmed down and restrained all her power, he asked again, “How much do you know about Abyss Island, which is also Sky City?”</p><p>Only by knowing yourself and your enemy can you win every battle.</p><p>Abyss Island was a legend… Xu Xiaoshou was born in the grassroots, so he only knew so much about this place.</p><p>However, the Lei family used to be the prosperous Higher Void Family. The expert of the family was even comparable to a Demi-Saint, so she should have more information than him.</p><p>Lei Xi’er shook her head slightly when she heard this:</p><p>“I don’t know much. After all, when the Lei family was around, I was still very young.”</p><p>“I’ve only heard some information about Abyss Island, but it’s limited to the Void Suppression Stele, the Pilgrimage Square, the Hall of Sins, the Void Attendant, and…”</p><p>As Lei Xi’er spoke, she looked over with a serious expression.</p><p>“This place is extremely dangerous. Countless dangerous places exist here. If you’re not careful, a Demi-Saint might even die here.”</p><p>“Startled, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>“This was the outer island of the Abyss Island. It couldn’t be regarded as the Seven Breaks, right?”</p><p>After all, the Seven Breaks referred to the Inner Island of Abyss Island. It was the Land of Exile for those at the Saint Stage.</p><p>“However, even the so-called ‘dangerous places’ on the Outer Island could kill a Demi-Saint?”</p><p>“…wouldn’t that be deceiving someone?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>“Water Ghost Dog Thief! What happened to the so called opportunity?”</p><p>It was said that wealth came from danger, but if one wanted wealth, one had to go to these dangerous places that could kill a Demi-Saint… wasn’t this playing with people?</p><p>“Let me calm down first.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought for a moment and stopped pretending.</p><p>He took out the Famed Sword Flame Python from the Yuan Mansion World. The Vicious Sword was made up of four swords. He held a pair tightly in each hand and said, “Please continue.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er looked at Xu Xiaoshou, who was fully armed, as if he was about to face a great enemy and her mouth involuntarily curved into a smile.</p><p>“So you are afraid of death too?”</p><p>At this moment, before she could say anything, the Famed Sword Flame Python, which had emerged from the Yuan Mansion world, suddenly vibrated violently. With a buzzing sound, its sword body straightened and it was about to fly higher.</p><p>“What’s happening now?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickly tightened his grip on the broken sword.</p><p>“Had it been assimilated by Hidden Bitter? What kind of power was this? The Flame Python was clearly very gentle in the past!”</p><p>He could not help but call out for Hidden Bitter as well. When the broken black sword became so excited that it twisted into a maggot, he ruthlessly used the Flame Python to smack it.</p><p>“What a good deed you’ve done!”</p><p>Hidden Bitter came close to breaking. He raised its sword body and there was three consecutive question marks:</p><p>“? ? ?”</p><p>“It’s none of my business. Who wouldn’t be excited to come out for some fresh air?”</p><p>“Master Flame Python was one of the two Elders. How would I dare to assimilate with it?”</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned. As he questioned Flame Python, he couldn’t help but look at Lei Xi’er, hoping to get some answers.</p><p>Flame Python: “Let’s go! You’re finally here. I’ll bring you on a treasure hunt!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: “? ? ?”</p><p>He looked at Flame Python, then at Hidden Bitter, and then at the bored Fourth Sword. In the end, he had no choice but to look at Lei Xi’er.</p><p>“There’s only one normal person left by my side?”</p><p>“It said it would take me on a treasure hunt …” Xu Xiaoshou raised the Flame Python, and the corners of his mouth twitched. “What do you think it means by that?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er: “? ? ?”</p><p>“Cursed, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“When you have this kind of owner, you will have this kind of Sword?” Lei Xi’er raised her eyebrows.</p><p>“Satirized, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: “It seems to be serious!”</p><p>“Serious…” Lei Xi’er fell into deep thought. If Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t joking, all of this should be real.</p><p>“Flame Python, where did you get it?” She thought of something and suspected that there was some connection between Flame Python and Abyss Island.</p><p>“White Cave!” Xu Xiaoshou said confidently.</p><p>“How did you get it?”</p><p>“It’s very ordinary…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly paused and thought of the Wretched Saint he met when he got the Flame Python from White Cave.</p><p>He was confused and his eyes started to twitch. He said weakly,</p><p>“It’s very ordinary. A treasure given to me by a Holy Emperor…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
