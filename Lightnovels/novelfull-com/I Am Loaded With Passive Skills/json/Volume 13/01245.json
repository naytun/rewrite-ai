He asked in shock, “After you were sealed by him, how did you come to this place? Also, from what I can see, the power in your body doesn’t seem to be in a sealed state.”</p><p>After seeing it clearly, Huang Quan realized that, unlike Meng Po, the power of Five Decays of Heaven and Man was still at its peak.</p><p>If he was also sealed, the water ball would have appeared, right? Otherwise, the water pressure would have crushed the Five Decays of Heaven and Man to death!</p><p>“I also..don’t know…”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man seemed to have his memories sealed and needed to be awakened bit by bit.</p><p>After a long time, he said helplessly, “I really can’t remember. I don’t know what happened after I was sealed. I only remember that when I woke up, I was in this deep sea.”</p><p>Huang Quan’s eyes were filled with doubt.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man had been thrown here by Holy Emperor Fengtian?</p><p>Then, what had happened to him after he was thrown here that led to the breaking of the seal on his power?</p><p>It couldn’t be that after Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s defeat against Holy Emperor Fengtian, the latter didn’t seal his opponent’s power, right?</p><p>“What about him?” Huang Quan didn’t ask any more questions. He shifted his gaze to the deep sea.</p><p>“He’s dead,” Five Decays of Heaven and Man replied calmly. He knew that Lord Huang Quan was talking about the tribulation transcender.</p><p>“How did he die?”</p><p>“The Nine Death Thunder Calamity itself is already difficult, not to mention the fact that he forcefully transcended 972 thunder tribulations in the Spell Forbidden Barrier… Heh! In the end, he even wanted to drag me down with him, but he obviously chose the wrong person.”</p><p>The corners of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s mouth curled up as if he had thought of something funny.</p><p>With just a few words, Huang Quan could already imagine the scene of a person trying to drag someone down with him before he died. However, this person had no choice but to drag someone with a decaying body. As a result, he was plagued by bad luck, and the Nine Death Thunder Calamity became even more terrifying.</p><p>He smiled as well.</p><p>However, soon, his smile froze.</p><p>This was because after chatting for a while, Huang Quan could already smell the foul stench on his body.</p><p>“As expected, I can’t talk to him much…”</p><p>The last trace of doubt in his heart was dispelled.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was still the person himself, the one who even he was a little afraid of.</p><p>Now that both of them were engaged in the topic, Huang Quan knew that he couldn’t continue this conversation, so he changed the topic again and asked, “How is it? Have you adapted to the power of the three loathsome eyes?”</p><p>“Three loathsome eyes?” Five Decays of Heaven and Man was slightly stunned.</p><p>“Hm?” Huang Quan looked over. “Why? Is there a problem?”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man frowned slightly and paused for a moment before saying, “There’s no problem, but I tried just now and still couldn’t open my eyes.”</p><p>“Seems like you still can’t get used to it…” Huang Quan muttered softly. He did not really mind.</p><p>The power of the three loathsome eyes was too strong after all, and Five Decays of Heaven and Man didn’t deliberately integrate into it. It was already very difficult for him to install the Lei family’s eyes.</p><p>As for opening his eyes…</p><p>Let time slowly erase all barriers.</p><p>“Wear a mask.”</p><p>While Huang Quan was still thinking, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had already opened the corners of his mouth, revealing a slightly kind smile.</p><p>He bent down and took a handful of water, washing away all the remaining blood stains on his face.</p><p>After doing all this, he took out an orange mask from the spatial ring and slowly put it on, covering all the stiff expressions in his words just now.</p><p>“Done.”</p><p>He straightened his body and adjusted his hands slightly as if he was adapting to this brand-new mask.</p><p>Huang Quan smiled as he watched.</p><p>Yama members were used to wearing masks. When they showed their real faces to others, they did occasionally feel uncomfortable.</p><p>Even he was used to not showing his real face to others.</p><p>However, in the past, he didn’t realize that this kind of situation would also happen to the Yama members…</p><p>“Lord…Huang Quan.” Five Decays of Heaven and Man pinched the mask on his face and asked in a much calmer tone, “What do you plan to do next?”</p><p>Huang Quan felt the full strength of Five Decays of Heaven and Man and said with a smile, “Your recovery is not bad. If Meng Po had ten percent of your strength, she probably wouldn’t have fainted.”</p><p>After he teased him, he went straight to the point. “There’s a Spell Forbidden Barrier here. Next, I might have to deal with a big enemy. Do you want to stay or go up ahead?”</p><p>If he went up, he would naturally leave the deep sea and return to Lone Cliff.</p><p>Fighting side by side with Five Decays of Heaven and Man was indeed not bad. After all, he would be a great addition to his combat strength, however, Huang Quan did not really want to.</p><p>This was because if the battle dragged on…</p><p>Perhaps, he and the demi-saint of the Jiang clan would have some accidents!</p><p>“Against who?” Five Decays of Heaven and Man asked.</p><p>“The Jiang clan’s demi-saint, the one I mentioned to you before. Now, he should have gone into the water and is on his way to find me,” Huang Quan said calmly.</p><p>Under the mask, Five Decays of Heaven and Man raised his eyebrows as if he was very surprised. However, he quickly regained his composure and said calmly, “Then I’ll stay and help Lord Huang Quan.”</p><p>“He actually decided to stay…” Huang Quan sighed in his heart.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was not a busybody.</p><p>Normally, if there was no mission, there would be no trace of him.</p><p>However, now that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man knew that his opponent was a demi-saint, he was indeed reluctant to leave.</p><p>Nonetheless, he decided to throw out the question and give the other party a choice.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
