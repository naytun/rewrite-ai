Along with this sentence, he heard the noise of the mortal world.</p><p>“There are buildings…”</p><p>The chaotic world of his consciousness was separated by this sentence, and the world was clearly divided.</p><p>Amidst the vast mist, there were tall buildings rising. They were made of azure bricks and tiles, and everything was floating. He did not know how tall the buildings were, but he could see clouds lingering around them and hear cranes singing.</p><p>“Sir!”</p><p>Xiu Yuanke looked as if he was on a pilgrimage. Suddenly, he saw a person standing at the top of the tower. The figure’s face could not be seen, and he was alone.</p><p>In the mist, that person raised his sword and danced at the top of the tower with the cranes singing in the background…</p><p>“Buzz Buzz Buzz!”</p><p>He could see some waves coming toward him from the graceful sword marks.</p><p>“Fantasy sword technique, Mo Sword Technique, Ghost Sword Technique, Emotion Sword Technique…”</p><p>Xiu Yuanke was stunned.</p><p>These were the secrets of the various sword techniques that he had not been able to break through for decades!</p><p>He was like a sponge, immediately calmed down and absorbed everything crazily, wanting to understand everything.</p><p>But suddenly, he thought of his teacher’s words.</p><p>“Do you know Fantasy Sword Technique?”</p><p>Greed made a man blind and foolish!</p><p>Xiu Yuanke immediately concentrated, resisted the temptation, and only pursued Fantasy Sword Technique according to his teacher’s instruction.</p><p>Space-time Transition and a single thought created eternity.</p><p>Xiu Yuanke forgot about time and space.</p><p>After some time, he finally understood what the sword that his teacher wanted to pass down to him was about.</p><p>He suddenly stood up.</p><p>Xiu Yuanke, who was holding the Immortal Peach Wood Sword, opened his eyes and looked at the chaotic world in front of him.</p><p>“It’s not a single sword!</p><p>“He wants me to absorb everything here!</p><p>“Fantasy Sword Technique, Ultimate Upanishad… Second World!”</p><p>Clang!</p><p>At this point of enlightenment, an ear-piercing sword chime resounded and tore the world in front of him into pieces.</p><p>Xiu Yuanke woke up from the chaos. The first thing he felt was the powerful Sword Will out of his body and reaching the clouds.</p><p>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”</p><p>He was like an evolving human who could blast Lone Cliff into pieces by emitting his aura.</p><p>He could hear the thrilling song of the sword flow around the Yunlun Mountain Range. It was Immortal Peach…</p><p>In front of him was an ancient city that stopped in the void, and it originated from his own power..</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Xiu Yuanke was at a loss.</p><p>Had he mastered the power of this peak-level ancient swordsman?</p><p>Wasn’t this something that he could or even dared to imagine in the past?</p><p>But now..</p><p>The dream had come true!</p><p>Xiu Yuanke was stunned. His gaze unconsciously swept over Cen Qiaofu and Water Ghost, who had witnessed his transformation from behind.</p><p>“Boom!”.</p><p>The Sword Will was surging like tides in his eyes, tearing the cliff apart and pushing the two in the back several dozen feet.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Xiu Yuanke was stunned again.</p><p>This was something he could do with just one glance.</p><p>He saw the shock in Cen Qiaofu and Shui Gui’s eyes at his transformation, but he couldn’t believe it. This was the power that he had obtained after waking up!</p><p>“Slap!”</p><p>In his daze, a weight appeared on his shoulder.</p><p>Xiu Yuanke turned around and saw his teacher’s weary face, but his eyes were still filled with encouragement and approval.</p><p>Bazhun’an truly did not expect that Xiu Yuanke, with his comprehension of the first realm of the Fantasy Sword Technique, would be able to receive this much from him. Moreover, he had comprehended so much of the second realm of the Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>He smiled and pointed at the sky.</p><p>Sky City had stopped moving because of Xiu Yuanke!</p><p>“Ten years to hide the sword, listen to the song of the sword…</p><p>“Go! Now is your time!”</p><p>After his teacher said so, Xiu Yuanke felt a crazy power surging in his heart. It was more stimulating than any Elixirs and more encouraging than any forbidden move.</p><p>“Ten years to hide the sword, listen to the song of the sword…”</p><p>Xiu Yuanke repeated this sentence. He felt that the world was vast, and only his teacher could understand him.</p><p>He raised his eyes and looked up.</p><p>Amidst the hazy red, Xiu Yuanke thought that this was the reflection of the fire of the ancient majestic city. He did not know the blood was from him.</p><p>He did not hesitate anymore.</p><p>He raised his sword.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>A resplendent sword light bloomed, and it was so huge that it covered the entire sky city.</p><p>Under the terrified gazes of all the Spiritual Cultivators in the Yunlun Mountain Range, this sword light submerged everything. It even slashed out a brand new resplendent light from the end of the world.</p><p>“What a beautiful sword strike!”</p><p>Xiu Yuanke’s eyes widened as he stared in disbelief at the sword he had slashed out.</p><p>Second World!</p><p>This was the Second World that he had dreamed of!</p><p>From this sword, he saw the figure dancing on the top of the sword tower. It wasn’t his teacher or the god of swords, but himself.</p><p>He, Xiu Yuanke, had slashed out with such a stunning sword!</p><p>This was the Second World that he had dreamed of!</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>After dancing in the wind, the wood sword Immortal Peach immediately cracked.</p><p>“Thud!”</p><p>Xiu Yuanke’s back was smashed to the ground on the cliff. His entire body was covered in blood, and everything before his eyes was blurred.</p><p>However, there was still a strong sense of amazement and beauty in the world in his eyes.</p><p>With happiness, what was the difference between death and life?</p><p>He had spent his whole life chasing after the ultimate swordsmanship…</p><p>The sword strike had been the most beautiful thing in his life!</p><p>“I made it!</p><p>“I made it!</p><p>“I made it!</p><p>“It was a strike… but sir, Eldest Senior Brother! I, Xiu Yuanke, made it!”</p><p>Xiu Yuanke didn’t close his eyes and shouted silently.</p><p>In the dust, between the gray and another beautiful world, he stared at the sword in his mind and finally stopped everything in his mind.</p><p>He was willing to die for swordsmanship.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
