(2)</p><p>While everyone was fighting and snatching treasures, Xu the Beast was carrying the Void Suppression Stele which was even taller than him. He staggered as it passed by, panting and shouting, “Give me a hand, give me a hand”– this scene was too cute!</p><p>“Liked, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the information bar.</p><p>What the hell!</p><p>Junior sister, what are you thinking of again?</p><p>“I’ll carry it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered for a long time. In the end, he still could not let go of this big treasure.</p><p>However, it was indisputable that the Void Suppression Stele would suppress the ability of a Spiritual Cultivator.</p><p>“Look at me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wanted to take the Void Suppression Stele away, but he did not intend to carry it himself.</p><p>He opened the world of Yuan Mansion and called out the two big guys who had been quietly cultivating and had not appeared for a long time.</p><p>“Ice, Ember.</p><p>“Come out! It’s finally your turn to show up!</p><p>Lei Xi’er was puzzled.</p><p>What familiar names! Where did she hear it before… She looked over in confusion.</p><p>The Yuan mansion world’s spatial passageway responded with two exciting cries.</p><p>“Hohoho!”</p><p>“Roar…”</p><p>Following that, the spatial passageway expanded, becoming several hundred meters long and wide.</p><p>From which stepped out a huge skeleton foot with burning white flame. In the end, Infernal White Skeleton Ice excitedly jumped out.</p><p>“Hohoho.”</p><p>As soon as he appeared, Ember was dancing with joy.</p><p>Ever since Xu Xiaoshou used the Infernal Original Seed to entice him into submission in the White Cave, he began his journey of serious cultivation.</p><p>How long had it been since it last came out of that skeleton nest?</p><p>Ember had lost count.</p><p>But at this moment, it had already undergone a qualitative change.</p><p>The benefits of the Infernal Original Seed to a creature like the White Skeleton were too great. Even if Xu Xiaoshou had only given a bit of the Infernal Original Seed’s power for it to swallow and comprehend.</p><p>At this moment, Ember had evolved from the Sovereign Physique to a stage comparable to the Cutting Path.</p><p>It was the Cutting Path of the Infernal Original Seed, not an ordinary Cutting Path.</p><p>Even though it wasn’t the Infernal lineage, Infernal White Skeleton Ember had inherited the signs of the Infernal lineage.</p><p>High combat strength, strong muscle… uh, strong bones!</p><p>Furthermore, its explosive ability was top-notch. Other than not knowing how to conduct alchemy, everything else was very Infernal!</p><p>It had long mastered the Infernal White Flame. It was only waiting for coming out of seclusion to conquer the world, casually crushing a Cutting Path or a Higher Void.</p><p>“Roar…”</p><p>Right after Ember, the Ice Blue White Skeleton, Ice also appeared.</p><p>It was also 500 feet tall. It was very compatible with the Giant Kingdom of Abyss Island.</p><p>With the catalyst of Three Days Frozen Calamity’s controllable power, Ice naturally had grown to the height of the Cutting Path during this time.</p><p>It looked quiet and gentle, but its combat strength could be said to be shocking the world.</p><p>When it was at the Sovereign Stage, he had been able to use the power of the Three Days Frozen Calamity to activate the ice-type Upanishad spirit array and prompt ice-type magic… no, forbidden spell, to attack the grey mist figure, Feng Yujin.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou hadn’t taken down the Three Days Frozen Calamity in the end, the grey mist figure’s sealing power would have been unsolvable. Ice wouldn’t have acknowledged and followed him even if it was beaten to death</p><p>The three-lineup arrangement, Aje, Ice, and Ember were all fierce.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to bring them out to the Shengshen Continent. Firstly, he wasn’t using the identity of Xu Xiaoshou. The three-lineup arrangement was too representative. It was easy to expose his identity.</p><p>Secondly, Aje was still fine, as he could become smaller.</p><p>The appearance of the two giants, Ice and Ember, would probably attract the attention of countless people and eventually become the target of public criticism.</p><p>Of course, these worries were gone after coming to Abyss Island.</p><p>Here seemed to be the giant kingdom. Was there anything wrong with letting Ice and Ember out to play?</p><p>And also…</p><p>“I am Xu Xiaoshou. I dare to bring out Ice and Ember now. I am not afraid of anyone!”</p><p>His current realm and ability.</p><p>Apart from demi-saint, Xu Xiaoshou was not afraid of any Spiritual Cultivators.</p><p>Furthermore, if he couldn’t defeat the other party, he could easily call back Ice and Ember to return to the world of Yuan Mansion world and escape via spatial teleportation.</p><p>With such a guarantee, what was there to be afraid of?</p><p>Abyss Island was a dangerous place. Who would dare simply follow and run around?</p><p>Hey, I had the Four Pillars of Destiny Token, I dared!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>On the side, Lei Xi’er looked at the two giants with fierce eyes and was stunned for a moment.</p><p>She knew the existence of Ice and Ember, but she had never seen them in the Yuan Mansion world. How would she have imagined that not only were these two still alive, but their combat strength had become even more terrifying than before?</p><p>“In the past, they were all cultivating. Hehe…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou explained with a smile.</p><p>The world of Yuan Mansion was very big. He had divided it into two parts. He copied the Spirit Fusion Swamp’s state of ice and fire. It was an easy task to let Ice and Ember cultivate and grow separately on their own.</p><p>Now, after a thousand days of training, it was time to use the army.</p><p>Now, it was time for them to shine.</p><p>“Hohoho…”</p><p>Ember couldn’t stop its excitement after coming out. It was as if its entire body was covered in fleas as he scratched and screamed.</p><p>He liked this place very much!</p><p>It was big enough!</p><p>This street, this building, this city… it didn’t look like it was for humans to play with. Could it be another old home?</p><p>“Hohoho…”</p><p>Where was this place?</p><p>Ember let out a strange cry, jumping up and down, and stomping the ground until it hummed.</p><p>“Don’t worry about this.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t in the mood to introduce tAbyss Island to the two of them. They wouldn’t understand even if he explained it to them.</p><p>At this moment, he glanced at Ember’s realm and physical strength, nodding his head in satisfaction.</p><p>“The power of the Infernal Original Seed and the Three Days Frozen Calamity, do you like them?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“Hohoho!” Ember was excited. He liked them!</p><p>“Roar.” Ice nodded.</p><p>“Now, you’ve become stronger too, right?” Xu Xiaoshou asked again.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
