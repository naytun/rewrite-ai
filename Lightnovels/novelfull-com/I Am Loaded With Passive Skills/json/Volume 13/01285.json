It was clear that she was still very interested in this stele. She didn’t know if it was because of the Lei family’s Memory Legacy Secret Technique that she had a greater understanding of the Abyss Island.</p><p>“Then I’ll do it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression became solemn. He looked carefree, but he was very cautious when it came to the Abyss Island.</p><p>Void Suppression Stele…</p><p>He didn’t know what it was, but it made him curious.</p><p>He brought out the Famed Sword Flame Python.</p><p>After thinking about it, he reckoned that this thing would be the key to the Great Infernal Ancestor’s treasure. It would be a pity if it was broken.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou switched to the Fourth Sword.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>With a light slash, the moss fell.</p><p>On the stone stele, a small and messy part of the stele was exposed. There was the character “Eight” carved on it.</p><p>“Sword Will?”</p><p>Sensing the Sword Will on the word, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyebrows shot up.</p><p>There were not many things related to the word “Eight” on the Abyss Island. Even on the Shengshen continent, Xu Xiaoshou could only find one word related to ‘Bazhun’an’ and ‘Eight’.”</p><p>Since there was no risk in using a sword to pick up the moss…</p><p>“Swish, Swish, Swish!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not stand on ceremony… He quickly and neatly removed all the moss in no time.</p><p>The large stone stele’s original appearance was revealed. It was a shock to the two people in front of it.</p><p>Because there were so many names on it!</p><p>“Hua Weiyang, Chengxue, Blackie, Feng Wuhen…”</p><p>“Who were all these people?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou and Lei Xi’er looked at each other; it was clear from their expressions that they had never heard of those names.</p><p>However, they were familiar with the row below.</p><p>“Bazhun’an, Dao Qiongcang, Bei Huai, Kong Yuhen, Sang Qiye, Yu Lingdi, Cao Yihan, YouTu, Gu Qingyi, Gu Qinger…”</p><p>“This?”</p><p>“They’ve all been here before?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s scalp tingled when she saw this line.</p><p>Most of these people were from the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>Even Elder Sang’s name had been left here, did that mean that almost all of these people had been to Abyss Island before?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was also stunned.</p><p>However, what stunned him were not the names of these big shots, but the last two.</p><p>“Gu Qingyi? Gu Qinger?”</p><p>“What’s going on? Could it be that these two brothers from the Burial Sword Tomb were the reincarnations of Boss?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought that among the three brothers from the Burial Sword Tomb, who were in the same row as Bazhu’an, the first two were actually Elders.</p><p>However, he soon figured it out.</p><p>These two should be the ones who had recently arrived at the Abyss Island, because on the Lone Cliff, a certain someone even jumped off the cliff in a suicide attempt, although he didn’t know why.</p><p>However, at the bottom of the cliff was the Deep Sea, so it was normal for Gu Qinger to arrive at the Abyss Island before them.</p><p>“This is the Void Suppressing Stele!” Lei Xi’er identified it and said with certainty.</p><p>“Oh…” Xu Xiaoshou sized up the stone stele and didn’t bother about those names. He walked around to the back and used his sword to pick off the moss, then saw the three big characters “Abyss Island”.</p><p>“Hmm, this should be the front, and that should be the back?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er heard this and came around. She also saw the difference between the front and the back.</p><p>“Weng!”</p><p>As the two of them were thinking nervously, the stone stele vibrated slightly and made a staccato sound:</p><p>“Please… leave… your… name…”</p><p>“Startled, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grabbed Lei Xi’er’s hand and took a step back. He quickly realized that other than the stone stele being able to speak, it did not have any intention of attacking anyone. He let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>“Dammit, you scared me to death!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cursed. The Void Suppression Stele did not respond either. He immediately became bolder.</p><p>Having lived for so long, it should have a spirit, right?</p><p>He freed his hand and went forward. He used the Fourth Sword to knock on the Void Suppression Stele. Xu Xiaoshou asked, “Is there a reward for leaving my name? My name is worth a thousand gold coins. If you spray out a precious bone for me, I will leave my name.”</p><p>“…” There was no response.</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s eyelids twitched wildly as she watched from the side.</p><p>“He is really good at this!”</p><p>“Was Xu Xiaoshou really not afraid of death?”</p><p>“Blessed, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>“Blessed?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced behind him with a strange expression. He then averted his gaze and looked at the Void Suppression Stele that remained silent. This time, he was not in a good mood.</p><p>He took out the Four Pillars of Destiny token and slapped it violently on the surface of the Void Suppression Stele.</p><p>“Do you recognize this Command Token? Seeing the Command Token is like seeing a person. I am the Master of the Black and White Veins. The Master of the Black and White Veins… speak to me!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Void Suppression Stele? What kind of trash are you!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Dammit! You have such a good temperament. Is that true? I don’t believe it!” Xu Xiaoshou angrily raised his Fourth Sword</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his Fourth Sword fiercely. “Speak! Otherwise, I’m going to chop you up!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
