She lifted her head and glanced at Water Ghost. After hesitating for a while, she finally braced herself and said, “Lord Huang Quan, it’s me, Meng Po. I think you may need to come over to Lone Cliff to pick me up now…”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Ahem! It was a long story. It is hard for me to explain to you now too. But, it was Water Ghost who saved me just now…”</p><p>Huang Quan was speechless.</p><p>The other side went silent all of a sudden.</p><p>Water Ghost could not hold it any longer. He burst into laughter upon hearing it.</p><p>Without letting Meng Po speak any further, he gestured with his hand and drew the communication bead over to himself. Then, he hung up instantly without giving Huang Quan a chance to ask further. He stopped Meng Po from talking too much as well.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>Meng Po was so confused when Water Ghost cut off the conversation all of a sudden.</p><p>Water Ghost leaned toward Meng Po again. A man with sophisticated features and a charming face was hidden under the Golden Mask. He emitted a seductive charm when his hair swayed with the breeze.</p><p>He did not answer Meng Po’s question directly. On the contrary, he restrained his smile and asked Meng Po in a seductive voice, “Meng Po, do you believe in me?”</p><p>What?</p><p>Meng Po was still immersed in the man’s charm at that time. She was so confused that she nodded vigorously.</p><p>Water Ghost then shook his head and sighed. He said, “Then, I shall teach you a lesson today. You may have heard about it before. But, it will not work on me…”</p><p>As he spoke, he came closer to Meng Po and lifted her chin with his hand. Then, he whispered in her ears. Meng Po’s face blushed instantly. Her heart was pumping fast as well.</p><p>“Never trust anyone in this world. Not even your benefactor. Do you understand?”</p><p>Meng Po’s heart skipped a beat upon hearing what he said.</p><p>Meng Po trembled upon feeling the warm breath in her ear. She had mixed feelings all of a sudden. Her body reacted strangely as well.</p><p>However, after she figured out what the Water Ghost meant, she felt so disappointed. She was stunned.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Without giving her any chance to talk further…</p><p>The next moment after he finished his words…</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Water Ghost reached out his hand and knocked Meng Po out. Meng Po became unconscious instantly.</p><p>“So naive!”</p><p>Water Ghost shook his head and burst into laughter. He then carried her in his arms and straightened his back. He took a few steps to the edge of the Lone Cliff and looked at the sea of clouds surrounding the cliff. He sighed.</p><p>“It seems that the plan is surprisingly smooth…”</p><p>He continued, “It is a bad sign. As the saying goes, after woe comes weal. I wonder if it is true?”</p><p>“But I have to admit that it feels good indeed,” said Water Ghost.</p><p>“Next, we shall see who would arrive first. Will it be the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan? Or Yama? I am so looking forward to it!”</p><p>The sunset shone onto the ruins of the Lone Cliff.</p><p>The dusk poured on Meng Po’s delicate body, reflecting the horror that was still lingering on her pretty face.</p><p>At the same time, it shone onto the Water Ghost’s golden mask, highlighting his charm through his smile.</p><p>The scene seemed to look warm though.</p><p>However, if a member of Night Cat like Yuan Haisheng came over and saw such a warm and romantic scene at the cliff, he would be terrified for sure!</p><p>It was because in the Night Cat Organization, even though everyone respected the gentle chief, they were afraid of him as well.</p><p>There was always a saying in the organization.</p><p>Once Water Ghost burst into laughter, one’s life would be unpredictable.</p><p>“Phew!”</p><p>After Water Ghost sighed, he was utterly incomparable. He threw Meng Po off the cliff just like the way he threw the Five Decays of Heaven and Man into the water.</p><p>After doing it, the Water-type Power Upanishad formation under his feet rotated. He grabbed from an abyss and pulled out three to four figures from the Way of the Heavens.</p><p>“What the fuck!”</p><p>All these stowaways from Cutting Path and Higher Void were eavesdropping initially. They were shocked by Water Ghost’s conversation over the call. However, they did not expect to have someone who was not a demi-saint to have the ability to pull them out from the abyss easily. So, all of them were terrified.</p><p>However, before they could say the words, “Please spare our lives!”, they were already being thrown into the deep sea by the Water Ghost like rubbish.</p><p>No need to ask!</p><p>Water Ghost knew that the connection to the Lone Cliff was too wide that it would attract a lot of people from Cutting Path and Higher Void.</p><p>More than half of them were assassins from the Three Incenses, who came here for the Black Gold Bounty that Xu Xiaoshou offered.</p><p>However, since they had the guts to come, they had to be prepared to become sacrificial offerings.</p><p>Otherwise, what was the point of having Water Ghost guarding the Lone Cliff at all times?</p><p>“What a busy job indeed!”</p><p>Water Ghost shook his head as he turned his head around imprudently and looked at the sky behind him.</p><p>The demi-saint of the Jiang Clan and Lord Huang Quan should be arriving soon.</p><p>He had contacted them just now. First, he called the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan. Then, he contacted Lord Huang Quan.</p><p>Water Ghost had promised to give them a “surprise”!</p><p>For the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan, Water Ghost gave him the conclusion that Yama had entered the water. In order to prevent him from suspecting, he offered the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan Meng Po and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man as bonus gifts.</p><p>On the other hand, he had to return Meng Po to Lord Huang Quan. At the same time, he had to let Lord Huang Quan enter the water as well. That was the only way for him to lure the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan into water.</p><p>Well, it seemed to be contradicting though.</p><p>What should he do it?</p><p>How could he get more bang for his buck?</p><p>By treating them as idiots and lying to them directly?</p><p>“Haha…”</p><p>Water Ghost gave it a thought as he laughed.</p><p>It really looked like “mission impossible” for both situations. If it were someone else, of course, it would be absolutely impossible.</p><p>However, Water Ghost was the master of Water-type Upanishad. The moment he planned to be the double agent, he had already come out with a solution.</p><p>Snap!</p><p>Water Ghost took two fist-sized blue beads out of his spatial ring. He held both beads in each hand and put them close to his temple. Then, he closed his eyes and started to imagine the scene.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
