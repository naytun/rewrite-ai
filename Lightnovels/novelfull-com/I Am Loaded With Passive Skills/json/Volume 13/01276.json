Two figures, one tall and one short stepped out of the teleportation portal.</p><p>War Machine Number Two, who was more than 30 feet tall, landed silently on the shattered mountain ground with Yan Wuse in its hand.</p><p>As the most mature Divine puppet, Number Two was equivalent to a domain-level teleportation portal.</p><p>It could go anywhere in the world.</p><p>As soon as they landed, Yan Wuse frowned.</p><p>“The power of Sword Cognition and Fantasy Sword Technique… Bazhun’an has been here before and made a move.”</p><p>“Hmm, traces of time and space attributes… this should be Yama’s Huang Quan, right?”</p><p>“Also, could-type demi-saint’s power…”</p><p>Yan Wuse pondered, and the words that Dao Qiongcang had said during the meeting of the Ten-member Council of the Holy Palace flashed through his mind. “This demi-saint acts on his own. Check Northern Region.”</p><p>Yan Wuse immediately had a person in mind.</p><p>“Demi-saint, Jiang Buyi?”</p><p>Yan Wuse analyzed almost all the people who had fought in this battle in a few seconds based on their auras and traces.</p><p>Behind him, Number Two, who was as huge as a giant, had many data streams flashing through his eyes. “You’re right,” it hummed.</p><p>Yan Wuse raised his eyes and glared at it. “Of course! Who the f*ck who am I? Also, you’ve been ordered to follow me, but don’t you have to hide as my ace in the hole?”</p><p>Number Two nodded. “You’re right.”</p><p>Then, it turned invisible.</p><p>Yan Wuse didn’t know what to say.</p><p>Forget it. Let’s go to Abyss Island first!</p><p>Yan Wuse could see Abyss Island hidden in the Second World when he looked up, but he was stunned.</p><p>How could he get in?</p><p>Behind him, Number Two seemed to have read his mind and appeared again. After, it spread out its hand and showed a small command token in his palm.</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao knew that you would forget to bring the void token, so he already asked me to bring one before the meeting.</p><p>“As expected, you forgot.”</p><p>Yan Wuse looked at the void token and fell into deep thought.</p><p>“What was going on?</p><p>“I am in charge of this operation, but Dao Qiongcang already predicted everything before the meeting,” he thought.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
