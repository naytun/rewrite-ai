Other than that, on the top left side of the extremely clean Void Suppression Stele, there were two more words.</p><p>“Shou… God”</p><p>Lei Xi’er muttered, and her beautiful face immediately turned red.</p><p>This was too shameless!</p><p>She even felt extremely ashamed when she read out these two words. “How could Xu Xiaoshou write that?”</p><p>“Shameless.”</p><p>“Shou God? Is he not ashamed?”</p><p>“Despised, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>While she was still thinking about this, Lei Xi’er suddenly saw that Xu Xiaoshou had finished writing ‘Shou God’ but did not stop there. He continued to write “Shou”…</p><p>“Shou God?”</p><p>“What does that mean?”</p><p>Before she could think, the fourth word was written.</p><p>“Shou God, Shou God…”</p><p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p><p>“Shou God Shou God Shou God…”</p><p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p><p>“…”</p><p>This time, no matter how stupid Lei Xi’er was, she could figure out what Xu Xiaoshou was trying to do.</p><p>This fellow actually planned to completely fill up the front of the Void Suppression Stele before it could react!</p><p>Was he really a human, not a demon?</p><p>Lei Xi’er stared blankly at Xu Xiaoshou’s increasingly impudent words as she fell into deep thought.</p><p>“Surprised, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>The more Xu Xiaoshou wrote, the crazier he became. The expression on his face also gradually became abnormal.</p><p>“Wahahaha, I’ve already helped you to do the calculations, little stone stele, just now. Your reaction is very slow. You need thirty breaths of time.”</p><p>“In thirty breaths of time, I can write two full sides for you, but today I’ll only write one side, I’ll consider it as giving you face.”</p><p>“Not much, 999 signatures. In the future when I become famous, you can cut off this stone stele and sell it for a sky-high price.”</p><p>“Are you excited? Isn’t this exciting?</p><p>“Heehee Heehee…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wrote until his laughter sounded really abnormal.</p><p>Following the afterimages in his hands, the Fourth Sword carved 999 names on the stone stele.</p><p>He did not believe that the Void Suppression Stele would not be angry enough to hit someone after being played like this.</p><p>“It was fine if you did not give me the treasure, but if you can resist hitting me today, I will remove the word ‘Shou’ from my name!</p><p>“Weng!”</p><p>Finally, after thirty breaths, the Void Suppression Stele reacted.</p><p>“Sinners… Shou God Shou…God Shou…God Shou God… Beast… Rope… eh?”</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>The Void Suppression Stele let out an ‘Eh’ sound.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up. He turned to look at Lei Xi’er and pointed at the Void Suppression Stele and laughed maniacally. “It, it’s stuck! I’m dying of laughter!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er: “…”</p><p>She was flabbergasted. She could not understand the scene which left a person speechless in front of her.</p><p>So why was it funny that the stele was stuck?</p><p>“Yes.” The corners of Lei Xi’er’s mouth twitched a little as she finally understood the ‘Shou style of humor.’</p><p>“What happened here, did it break down?”</p><p>At this moment, the Void Suppresion Stele was still struggling..</p><p>“Shou God… Beast… Aunt…God… Shou Aunt… Receive… Uh Uh uh UH UH…”</p><p>After a while…</p><p>The uttering of “Shou Shou” and ‘Aunt’ disappeared and only the short and rapid sounds of ‘UH UH UH’ could be heard.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou guessed that after millions of years on this Abyss Island, the Void Suppression Stele was not functioning too well and its energy was insufficient.</p><p>“But I didn’t think it could be so bad that it couldn’t even say the last two sentences.”</p><p>“Void Suppression Stele, Void Suppression Stele, you are really a big baby!”</p><p>After he used the Fourth Sword to slash it twice, he realized that no matter how humiliated it was, the Void Suppression Stele would not attack anyone. Xu Xiaoshou was happy.</p><p>“Make way.” He braced himself and got into position.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Lei Xi’er was nervous. “Is this another trick?”</p><p>“The Void Suppression Stele had already been damaged, what else do you want to do?”</p><p>“Baby!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou put away the three swords and rolled up his sleeves, turned his head and said excitedly, “This big treasure only knows how to say ‘Uh uh uh’. Although it can’t spit out a mini treasure, even Four Swords can’t cut through it. What level do you think it is at?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was dumbfounded. “You mean…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t reply.</p><p>But in the next second, Lei Xi’er knew what he meant.</p><p>After this guy had positioned himself, he stretched out his hands and actually grabbed the oval boulder that was taller than a person and then exerted some force.</p><p>“Peng! Peng!”</p><p>The ground beneath his feet shattered. Xu Xiaoshou’s knees sank into the ground. One could imagine how heavy the Void Suppression Stele was.</p><p>However, in the next second…</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Golden spots of light glowed on Xu Xiaoshou’s body as he activated his ‘Exploding Posture’.</p><p>The Void Suppression Stele was lifted up by a human amidst the sounds of ‘Uh uh’!</p><p>“Lei Xi’er, let’s go!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lifted the Void Suppression Stele and balanced it on his shoulder. He turned his head and his eyes burned with passion. “If I use this thing to hit a Demi-Saint, it will definitely hurt! It will be great! As for the Higher Void level… it will definitely hit one at a time!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er: “Uh…”</p><p>The Void Suppression Stele: “Er er er er…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
