In the end, a bare-chested Elder with shackles on his wrists could be seen..</p><p>His eyes were closed and he seemed to be fast asleep amid the center of the scorching magma. It was as if the white sparks and the entire volcano made up the lower half of his body.</p><p>An unknown amount of time passed.</p><p>“PFFT…”</p><p>A strange sound appeared, and the Elder who was asleep in the center of the flower petals suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p>At this moment, a strong wave of Holy Power rippled out.</p><p>After a loud rumble, the entire volcano instantly erupted. White magma spewed out and rose to the Nine Heavens.</p><p>“It’s finally here… .”</p><p>“A hundred years? Three hundred years? How long has it been?”</p><p>“It’s been so long, but at least I, this old Ancestor have waited for the arrival of an heir!”</p><p>The Elder muttered. His eyes were filled with primitive and violent thoughts as well as a strong flash of pleasant surprise.</p><p>Not long after.</p><p>Seeing that the volcano had come to life, a stream of Holy Power descended in the distance. It took the form of a human and was extremely far away from the volcano. It bowed and said respectfully,</p><p>“Elder Ancestor, you’re awake?”</p><p>“The Black Vein Dragon is roaring in fury again. This time, it wants to challenge you.”</p><p>“It said that should it lose, it will shift thirty percent of their people over and will not disturb us for three years.”</p><p>“But if you don’t agree, all the activities of the White Vein will be disrupted… This madman!”</p><p>Within the white sea of volcanic magma, the Elder sneered, “Black Dragon? Didn’t Seven Trees fight with it last time?”</p><p>“Yes, the Seven Trees Emperor only managed a tie in the fight. There was no victory or defeat, so the bet last time was invalid. And with the Black Dragon’s physique, it will only take a few months for it to regain its vigor.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Okay, I’ll send it away now… Ah? Elder Ancestor, what did you say just now?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Yes? Elder Ancestor, didn’t you decide not to fight with it? This fellow is so arrogant because of his invincible physical body. Elder Ancestor, you don’t need to bother with him at all…”</p><p>“Today, I’m happy.”</p><p>“… Alright, then I’ll go reply to that Black Dragon right now! This time, when Elder Ancestor makes his move, there’s definitely no coming back for him!”</p><p>“Tell the Black Dragon that if he loses this time, he’ll have to fulfil this condition, which is to add three more drops of his ‘Dragon Heart Blood’. One drop will be sent to me, one drop will be handed over to the White Vein treasury for them to hold their event. There’s still one more drop…”</p><p>Holy shit!</p><p>Dragon Heart Blood!</p><p>“Was Elder Ancestor really going to have a showdown with the Black Dragon this time?”</p><p>The Demi-Saint outside the volcano was excited when he heard this.</p><p>There would be a big show to watch on the Inner Island.</p><p>Also, if Elder Ancestor could win, one drop of the ‘Dragon Heart Blood’ would be added to the White Vein treasury.</p><p>In other words, there was a chance for the people from White Vein to win?</p><p>“Then the last drop of the Dragon Heart Blood…” the Demi-Saint carefully probed.</p><p>“Have the Black Dragon personally hand it over to someone on the Outer Island.”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“This Elder Ancestor’s descendant, the one who holds the Famed Sword Flame Python, a young man from the Infernal Lineage.”</p><p>“Young man… What’s his name?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>…</p><p>“Achoo!”</p><p>“Who’s trying to trick me?”</p><p>Abyss Island, in front of the big stone stele.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his nose and looked around vigilantly.</p><p>This place didn’t look dangerous at all, but he believed that danger lurked everywhere. Only then could it live up to its title of ‘Sacred Secret Abyss Island’.</p><p>Moreover, if nothing unexpected happened, a large number of his enemies should have gathered here already.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao, Ye Xiao… These were from the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>Double Dumba*s, Elder Xie, Ghost Granny… These were the last of the Three Incenses that had not been killed. What a pity.</p><p>Huang Quan… with his ability to become the Yama Chief, there was no need to suspect that there was something wrong with his IQ. Therefore, if nothing unexpected happened, this person could only think that he had been trapped by Water Ghost.</p><p>As for the Saint Servant Water Ghost, and the Saint Servant, Xu Xiaoshou, they were of the same origin.</p><p>If they met by chance in this place, it was understandable that the other party would kill the Saint Servant, Xu Xiaoshou, to vent his anger.</p><p>“I wonder if his invitation to me to join Yama and conspire with him is still valid?” Xu Xiaoshou was still obsessed with this thought. He felt that if he really met this person, he could let him join Yama and resolve the enmity between them. It would be considered a gentlemanly move.</p><p>After all, a gentleman would not stand under a dangerous wall.</p><p>And…</p><p>Jiang Buyi!</p><p>This was a Demi-Saint!</p><p>It was likely that this was the greatest hidden danger in the Abyss Island apart from the original danger.</p><p>Of course, Jiang Buyi probably did not know that his being trapped on the Abyss Island had something to do with Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>However, this did not stop Xu Xiaoshou from making a clear path for himself in his heart.</p><p>In short, this Demi-Saint could either hide or if he could not hide, then he could only continue to deceive the others. In short, he could not fight.</p><p>“I’m only a Master Stage…”</p><p>Recalling his cultivation level, Xu Xiaoshou panicked once more.</p><p>He didn’t have enough time!</p><p>It was fortunate that Water Ghost had promised him that the Abyss Island was a place where risks and opportunities coexisted. He hoped that before he ran into danger, he could encounter some opportunities and raise his cultivation level!</p><p>“More power…”</p><p>After he encouraged himself, Xu Xiaoshou stopped thinking about the risks. Instead, he was filled with curiosity about the Abyss Island.</p><p>He had matured to this point and already had his own opinions and judgments about the so-called ‘big situation’.</p><p>In a chaotic situation, small characters thrived better.</p><p>Under Water Ghost’s ‘tutelage’, now that he was in a dangerous situation, Xu Xiaoshou’s first reaction was no longer to protect himself. Instead, he began to think about how to seek greater benefits for himself.</p><p>After all.</p><p>“It should be very difficult for me to die in this place!” Xu Xiaoshou clenched his fists.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
