As the Fourth Sword’s sword energy slashed down, Double Dumba*s split into two and dodged the two ends of the sword energy.</p><p>Putting everything else aside, how could a Master (Stage) be comparable to the battle consciousness of the higher void (level)?</p><p>It was true that Xu Xiaoshou was very strong with the Fourth Sword. He could ignore the attack damage from the difference in cultivation realms.</p><p>However, in the eyes of Double Dumba*s, his movements were as slow as a baby holding a sword.</p><p>Double Dumba*s thought that if he were hit once by the Fourth Sword, he would be considered lost! And the price was death!</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>Transforming his body into streams of light, Double Dumba*s and his second clone pounced forward at the same time.</p><p>As they were running, their hands suddenly shone with golden light, turning into four golden triangular bayonets.</p><p>“Spirit Severing Strike!”</p><p>This strike contained a high concentration power of the gold-type path principles.</p><p>As long it struck the target, it could instantly destroy the target’s energy reserve. At the very least, the spiritual source would become chaotic. And at most, the target would die on the spot.</p><p>If nothing went wrong, as long as Xu Xiaoshou was hit by this technique of his, it was impossible for a Master (Stage) junior to only be lightly injured!</p><p>“So fast…”</p><p>Two golden rays of light flew over, and Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils constricted.</p><p>It was fortunate that he had the “Agility” reaction of the Sovereign Stage. Otherwise, if it was any other Master (Stage), no matter how strong his combat strength was, it would be impossible for him to catch the speed of Double Dumba*s at the higher void level.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou admitted that he had underestimated the other party…</p><p>When he killed Yi, he had a connection with Patriarch Wuji. When he killed Golden Foot and Little Ninja, he had help from the Spell Forbidden Barrier of the deep sea world.</p><p>These higher voids indeed were all dead, but the process could not be ignored. They all happened at the right place and at the right time.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had thought the same for Double Dumba*s.</p><p>After all, this guy had been smashed by the void attendant. When he showed up, he had to rely on the void attendant to move his feet…</p><p>But it was different in reality!</p><p>Even if Double Dumba*s was at his dead end, a wisp of spiritual source in his energy reserve could still unleash terrifying combat strength.</p><p>In addition, there was no Spell Forbidden Barrier in this place, not even the intimidating presence of Patriarch Wuji. This had caused him to face hindrance everywhere.</p><p>As long as he squeezed out the last wisp of spiritual source and stimulated some potential, Double Dumba*s could also unleash 60-70% of his peak stage combat strength.</p><p>But…</p><p>“That’s all!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not retreat at all.</p><p>He was also thinking that if the attack of Double Dumba*s could break through his defense, then the Sovereign Physique that he had strengthened with so many passive points, as well as all the other passive skills, would be going down the drain!</p><p>Moreover, in the face of this spiritual technique, he did not only use his physical body to resist it.</p><p>“Close-bounds Force Field!”</p><p>With the swirl of the Fourth Sword, Xu Xiaoshou revealed his all-rounded offensive and defensive Awakening Skills without hesitation.</p><p>Since he might not be able to dodge the attack of Double Dumba*s, and since this fellow was an assassin and would definitely have a way out to counterattack if he failed in one strike…</p><p>Then, to completely eliminate his way out, he would use the Close-bounds Force Field. I would be considered lost if you could get close to me!</p><p>“Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang…”</p><p>The intangible Close-bounds Force Field instantly exploded with countless sword lights after Double Dumba*s got close to him, blocking the Spirit Severing Strike.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the triangular bayonet and the sword energy clashed countless times.</p><p>“What method is this?”</p><p>Double Dumba*s was stunned by this strange spiritual technique. However, he couldn’t think too much about it during the battle.</p><p>Since you were defending, I would force my way in!</p><p>“Golden Buddha Body!”</p><p>The instant they were bounced away by the Close-bounds Force Field, the two Double Dumba*s shouted out at the same time. And their bodies were covered in indestructible golden scales.</p><p>“Om…”</p><p>Like striking a bell, the spiritual attack that came with the Golden Buddha’s Body exploded in Xu Xiaoshou’s mind.</p><p>“Dizzy! Let’s see how you can defend!”</p><p>The corners of Double Dumba*s’s lips lifted. He had long known that Abyss Island had a strange suppressive power against the spiritual source. Therefore when he used his previous move, he had modified his spiritual source and was waiting for the second combo.</p><p>At this time, would a mere Master (Stage) be able to recover in less than three or four breaths under the spiritual attack of the Golden Buddha Body that could affect the higher void?</p><p>And to determine the victor in a battle, why would it take such a long time?</p><p>An instant was enough!</p><p>“Your head on top is mine!”</p><p>Double Dumba*s grinned maliciously. With the defensive power of the Golden Buddha Body, he was going to forcefully break through the Close-bounds Force Field.</p><p>No one knew how much Xu Xiaoshou’s head was worth more than this gold hunting token killer.</p><p>“Dizzied, Passive points +1.”</p><p>His mind went blank.</p><p>Spirit Awakening was triggered.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou instantly recovered. In his pupils, the two golden Double Dumba*s that looked like Buddha were enlarged.</p><p>“God Devil Eyes, open!”</p><p>A delicate voice sounded behind him.</p><p>At the same time, a white Reborn Lily bloomed under the feet of Xu Xiaoshou and Double Dumba*s.</p><p>Lei Xi’er had never let her guard down.</p><p>This time, her opponent was a higher void. Thus how could she not go all out?</p><p>Double Dumba*s’s Spiritual Dizziness was a joke under the self-defense mechanism of the God Devil Eyes.</p><p>After realizing that Xu Xiaoshou might be controlled, she immediately chose to resolve the control.</p><p>While the divine power in her left eye was strengthening Xu Xiaoshou, the demonic power in her right eye tapped on Double Dumba*s… As she didn’t know which was his real body, she tapped on both of them!</p><p>“Purified, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Bathed by the holy divine light, Xu Xiaoshou at this moment felt that his spirit was clear. Even his reaction speed had increased to more than doubled.</p><p>As far as his eyes could see, the two Buddha Double Dumba*s who had been acting recklessly just now were now tainted with devilish energy. There was a look of hesitation in their eyes, and even their movements had become slightly sluggish.</p><p>“Dumba*s, spiritual attacks are useless against me. Just forcefully control this guy.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
