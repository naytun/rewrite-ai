You don’t even know how to write the word ‘death’!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s eyes welled with tears when he heard this. He finally dispelled the absurd thoughts in his heart. The Spiritual Cultivation world was really terrifying.</p><p>“I got it…”</p><p>“Don’t even think about going out. I don’t have any more wine here. Go to the wine cellar and fetch some wine.”</p><p>“Oh, okay.”</p><p>Watching his child walk into the basement, Cao Yihan fell into deep thought.</p><p>“A hundred generations in exchange for Bazhun’an…”</p><p>“Ha, how crazy is that! Is this a declaration that you are coming back?”</p><p>He turned around and wanted to stand up.</p><p>However, with this movement, his Energy Reserve Saint Origin exploded with a clap of thunder, seemingly about to be revived.</p><p>The surging power gushed through his limbs and bones, as if it was about to break through the layers of shackles…</p><p>“What the…!”</p><p>Cao Yihan cursed angrily and quickly laid down again.</p><p>The more he thought about it, the angrier he got. He tore off the iron ring from his neck. There were nine Command Tokens hanging on the iron ring, each with the word ‘Forbidden’ written on it.</p><p>He gripped it in his hand and was about to crush it to vent his anger.</p><p>However, in the end, Cao Yihan endured it.</p><p>“Damn this Weapon Prohibition Order. Even nine of them can’t suppress the Demi-Saint Sub Level. Dao Qiongcang, you’re a piece of trash!” The giant in the backyard pointed at the ceiling and cursed angrily:</p><p>“Old Daoist, if you want me to stay still, bring me more wine!”</p><p>…</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>Because of the Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict and the phrase ‘A hundred generations in exchange for Bazhun’an.’</p><p>Almost all the people from the previous era could hear this declaration:</p><p>“I’m back!”</p><p>This time, it was not only speaking to the Holy Divine Palace. It was not just a vague figure who stood back between the battle of the Saints and acted as the mastermind behind the scenes.</p><p>Instead, in a majestic manner, Saint Servant, Bazhun’an, solemnly declared to the Five Domains of the Continent,</p><p>“I’m back!”</p><p>If the reverberation of the Holy Power of the Yunlun Mountain Range last time created a bubble of disillusionment, many people thought but didn’t dare to confirm whether Bazhun’an had really recovered from his passive state.</p><p>This time, when the Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict was issued, no one believed it anymore!</p><p>The Swordsman of the Eastern Region celebrated while the Demi-Saint of the Five Regions trembled in shock.</p><p>The initiator, Bazhun’an, was high in the sky above the Lone Cliff. After the edict was issued, he lost the protection of the Holy Emperor’s Power, and he fell instantly like a meteor.</p><p>“Unlucky.”</p><p>One second, Water Ghost was still immersed in the artistic spirit and conception created by Bazhun’an, and the next second, he saw the imageless ‘Old Eight Sword Diety’ coming at him. His mouth twisted with anger.</p><p>Too weak!</p><p>He raised his hand and the current of water caught the powerless Bazhun’an, preventing him from being smashed into pieces and dying. Water Ghost let out a long sigh.</p><p>“Water, water…”</p><p>Bazhun’an seemed to have been drained dry. After he got up, he was so weak that he didn’t even have the strength to speak.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu covered his face and handed over the flask of wine. He didn’t say a word, as if he could not bring himself to look at the current state of the person who announced the Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict.</p><p>“Gulp, Gulp, Gulp.”</p><p>Bazhun’an gulped down a few mouthfuls of medicinal wine before he felt his weak body regaining some strength. He finally didn’t look like a weak shrimp anymore.</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>There came the sound of explosions in the air.</p><p>Bazhun’an raised his eyes. The Sky City that descended from the sky was falling in their direction.</p><p>The ancient city was falling at an extremely rapid speed. It was estimated that it would smash everyone here to death in less than fifteen minutes.</p><p>“Close the net.”</p><p>Bazhun’an turned his eyes and looked at Water Ghost.</p><p>“You, you, you…”</p><p>Before Water Ghost could move, an untimely voice sounded from the side.</p><p>Bazhun’an was in a daze as he looked over.</p><p>He saw an old man with one arm and lame in one leg, who had reverted to his original form due to the Holy Emperor’s aura. He was so excited that his face was flushed red.</p><p>His fingers were stuffed into his mouth and his feet were clamped tightly together. He kept jumping up and down like a little girl.</p><p>When he saw his idol looking at him, the old man’s old eyes widened and blazed like a light bulb. They emitted a fanatical light, and white steam came out of his scalp.</p><p>“You, you, you…” Xiu Yuanke was so excited that he couldn’t say a complete sentence.</p><p>“?” Bazhun’an raised his eyebrows.</p><p>“I, I, I…” Xiu Yuanke almost fainted on the spot.</p><p>“…”</p><p>Bazhun’an took a deep breath and looked at the stranger, then turned to Cen Qiaofu and Water Ghost.</p><p>“Who’s this stutterer?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
