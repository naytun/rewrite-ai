Thump!”</p><p>“Thump! Thump!”</p><p>After a short pause, the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale started resounding again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that Jiang Buyi was on his way.</p><p>With the Demi-Saint’s speed, he should be able to suppress the Higher Void Level even without the help of any holy elements as it rushed toward him.</p><p>However, no matter how fast he was, it could not surpass the speed of Teleportation…</p><p>“It’s time to run.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Situ Yongren and slowly stretched out his hand.</p><p>Situ Yongren was like a puppet that was at the mercy of others. He closed his eyes in despair as he was very familiar with the escape process.</p><p>In the next second, Xu Xiaoshou grabbed his collar and threw him onto his shoulder. Spatial Power rippled around him.</p><p>The moment the light from the Spell Forbidden Barrier was triggered, the two figures disappeared on the spot.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>Three breaths later, a flash of light appeared.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s Demi-Saint Clone landed on the spot. When he saw the empty Deep Sea, a look of anger appeared on his face.</p><p>“Damn it, it runs faster than a rabbit!”</p><p>This was already his eleventh chase attempt.</p><p>However, every time he was about to catch up with him, Huang Quan’s clone would take Situ Yongren and flee using Spatial Teleportation.</p><p>Under the Deep Sea, the other party could use his Spatial abilities, but he could not use any Spiritual Technique… Jiang Buyi had not experienced such humiliation for a long time.</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>Without any hesitation, Jiang Buyi followed the guidance of the Dao-seeking pearl again and quickly ran in the direction where Huang Quan’s clone was hiding.</p><p>His speed was extremely fast.</p><p>And every time he landed, he would leave a Demi-Saint’s Will on the spot.</p><p>As long as Huang Quan’s clone made a mistake and teleported to the area where it had been teleported to, the Demi-Saint’s Will would be triggered and turn into a Demi-Saint’s Clone of Will.</p><p>Huang Quan’s clone always fled in this way and didn’t even dare to talk or fight. This meant that his combat strength was extremely weak.</p><p>As long as he was caught, the Demi-Saint’s Clone of Will would attack forcefully without the Demi-Saint’s Will Incarnation. It would turn into a Spiritual Attack and suppress his teleportation.</p><p>This was an extremely time-consuming method.</p><p>However, at the moment, it seemed that Jiang Buyi had no other way except to traverse through the entire Deep Sea to catch Huang Quan.</p><p>As for time…</p><p>Jiang Buyi was not short of time at all!</p><p>In the time it took to brew a cup of tea, it was already his eleventh attempt at chasing after Huang Quan’s clone.</p><p>Moreover, each Demi-Saint’s Will covered an area of a mile.</p><p>How wide was the Deep Sea?</p><p>How long could Huang Quan’s clone run?</p><p>Within two hours, the Deep Sea would be filled with the clones of Demi-Saint’s Will that could be activated at any time.</p><p>Jiang Buyi didn’t believe that Huang Quan’s clone would be able to find a place that hadn’t undergone Spatial Teleportation after two hours.</p><p>At that time, Huang Quan’s clone might be able to complete the teleportation, and the surrounding Demi-Saint’s Will would be activated at the same time…</p><p>“Do you think you can escape?”</p><p>“Not a chance!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Senior, this is already the 36th time. When will it end?”</p><p>Situ Yongren was once again thrown onto his shoulder, and his face was livid.</p><p>Even if he could withstand the high-frequency Spatial Teleportation, his body, which had lost the protection of his Spiritual Source, would soon be unable to withstand the repeated blows.</p><p>“Yue”</p><p>He suddenly retched.</p><p>Huang Quan’s shoulders were extremely tough, but they were also extremely sharp.</p><p>Even though Huang Quan was controlling his strength, Situ Yongren’s chest and stomach were already bleeding from the constant friction.</p><p>“It’s still going to take a long time…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said. He didn’t know when it would end. After the Spatial Teleportation was completed, he fell into deep thought.</p><p>“Why wasn’t Water Ghost here yet?”</p><p>“This wave of enticement was already very successful, right?”</p><p>It had already been more than a quarter of an hour… who else in the world can slip away from a Demi-Saint with the cultivation level of a Master Stage for such a long time?</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“Let’s not talk about a Master Stage!”</p><p>“Even the Higher Void level wouldn’t be able to slip away from a Demi-Saint for such a long time, it’s like walking a dog in the Deep Sea, right?”</p><p>In Xu Xiaoshou’s impression, his mission was to hook… Pei, draw in.</p><p>To hook was to procrastinate.</p><p>“Wasn’t the purpose of this delaying tactic so that Water Ghost could have a better way to slaughter the Saint?”</p><p>Fifteen minutes…</p><p>“Even the casting of the Forbidden Spell did not take this long!”</p><p>“Did Water Ghost already start the casting and chanting of the spell, or had it completely forgotten about him and focused on other things?”</p><p>“Senior, I have to remind you that the Deep Sea isn’t that big. If you keep teleporting like this, something might happen,” Situ Yongren said while trying to hold back his nausea before the teleporting started again.</p><p>“Something might happen?” Xu Xiaoshou scoffed. “What could possibly happen?”</p><p>He had the ‘Vanishing Technique’ and the “Ascending to the Heavens in a Single Step.’</p><p>What more for a Demi-Saint who couldn’t even summon a spell.</p><p>Even if the Master of the Deep Sea, Water Ghost, came down, he wouldn’t be able to stop him if he really wanted to run away.</p><p>Situ Yongren’s intelligence was always on overdrive when faced with a life-and-death crisis.</p><p>He immediately said,</p><p>“Even if 99% of a Demi-Saint’s power is sealed by the Spell Forbidden Barrier, it’s not that simple.”</p><p>“Let’s not talk about anything else. He only needs to leave a Demi-Saint’s Will in the Deep Sea after every landing. At that time, if we were to teleport to the same location, I’m afraid we won’t be able to come out.”</p><p>“Because under the pressure of the Demi-Saint’s Will, Senior might not be able to withstand it.”</p><p>Situ Yongren hesitated.</p><p>Huang Quan’s combat strength was extremely formidable. Not only was he able to use the Time and Space Attributes in the Deep Sea, he was also familiar with all aspects of the Deep Sea… he was simply invincible!</p><p>“However, the spirit and soul should be his weakness, right?”</p><p>There were too many ways for a Demi-Saint to deal with the Higher Void level. The example he gave was just a drop in the ocean.</p><p>“Why didn’t you say so earlier!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost blurted out when he heard this.</p><p>He had encountered a Demi-Saint before, but he had only met Demi-Saint Zang Ren once from afar. He basically did not understand the constitution of a Demi-Saint’s combat strength.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
