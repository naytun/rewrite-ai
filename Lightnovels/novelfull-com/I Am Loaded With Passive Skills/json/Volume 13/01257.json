As he hammered away, he couldn’t help but think back to the strange phenomenon that had made him delay returning the knife.</p><p>“A hundred generations in exchange for Bazhun’an, I summon the Divine Light by my command…”</p><p>“He’s such a cultured person, unlike me, who only knows how to babble like a child.”</p><p>“Hmm… this person should be the Eighth Uncle that father mentioned, right?”</p><p>The little giant had two eyeballs sandwiched between his fierce face, and his eyes were filled with longing.</p><p>He was twenty-six years old, just at the age of vigor and vitality.</p><p>Who wouldn’t feel excited and yearn for the holy miracle that occurred earlier?</p><p>Cao Erzhu thought back to his life.</p><p>His mother passed away due to a difficult labor; his sister had enough of his father’s bad temper and ran away from home, and he had been forging iron in this rundown blacksmith shop for more than twenty years.</p><p>Sometimes, he really had enough of this kind of mortal life.</p><p>He was clearly very strong, but he could not use any of his abilities. He was just like a piece of trash.</p><p>He also wanted to walk out of the blacksmith shop and step into that mysterious domain to fight with those immortal Spiritual Cultivators. However, his father had only allowed him to fight with wild beasts and did not allow him to step into the Spiritual Cultivation World at all.</p><p>“A hundred generations in exchange for Bazhun’an…”</p><p>Cao Erzhu bombarded the iron billet as he recited this chant. Suddenly, his blood energy surged up and hot air spewed from his seven orifices. He felt an inexplicable power appear, which built up in him a feeling of resistance.</p><p>“Father!”</p><p>He turned his head, his hands still moving unceasingly. However, he shouted and looked at the backyard, which was sealed at the top and did not let in the sun.</p><p>In the dark backyard, there were occasional flashes of blue lightning, outlining the silhouette of an even more burlier giant.</p><p>This giant was also bare-chested. In this small blacksmith shop that looked like the inside of a volcano, he still had on a large cloak.</p><p>He was holding a huge wine barrel in his hand. It was like a huge stone mound which filled up the entire backyard.</p><p>The lightning flashed and illuminated the time. One could vaguely see the muscles on his arms. They were knotted and huge, so big that they could match up to three times the size of the pig slaughterer’s head just now!</p><p>“Burp”</p><p>A heavy burp, accompanied by the strong smell of alcohol, and a nasal ‘En’ sound greeted Cao Erzhu’s call, indicating that his father was still awake.</p><p>Cao Erzhu took a deep breath and said loudly,</p><p>“Father!”</p><p>“I’ve mastered the God Punishment Tribulation and the six forms of Penetrating Divine Senses. I’ve also mastered up to the twelfth stage of your ‘Gentleman’s Hammer Technique’. I can’t level up my Sovereign Physique anymore. There’s also the Spiritual Cultivation Realm. I’m also at the Sovereign Dao Realm…”</p><p>“BURP!” A hiccup interrupted Cao Erzhu’s spell casting. Following it was a faint, raving thunderous voice. “Get… to the main point, Burp!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu shivered and said weakly, “Dad, I, I want to go out.”</p><p>“Where to?”</p><p>“Just, just out.”</p><p>“How far?”</p><p>“Quite far.”</p><p>“When will you come back?”</p><p>“No, I don’t know…”</p><p>There was a loud bang.</p><p>The blacksmith shop exploded with a sound like muffled thunder, followed by two intersecting electric bolts that rushed over. “Er Zhu, what are you talking about?”</p><p>Cao Er Zhu didn’t dare to meet his father’s gaze at all. He turned his head and knocked on the iron block. He thought of the heroic spirit of ‘Bazhun’an’ and said forcefully, “I actually want to go to the outside world… and catch a glimpse of it.”</p><p>“If you leave, who will take care of me?” In the darkness, a voice as loud as thunder sounded again.</p><p>Cao Erzhu stopped knocking and scratched his head with a big red hammer. There was a hint of confusion in his eyes. “It seems to be…”</p><p>“Burp!”</p><p>Another heavy burp. The giant in the backyard gulped down the contents of the wine barrel and then threw it away. After wiping his mouth, he became much more sober and said,</p><p>“It’s too dangerous outside. Were you tricked by your Eighth Uncle? He’s lying to you and just waiting to lead a child like you to your death.”</p><p>“How old are you? Even if you have mastered what you said just now, do you know how dangerous the Spiritual Cultivation World is outside?”</p><p>Cao Erzhu cowered. His eyes were full of curiosity. “How dangerous?”</p><p>The giant in the backyard let out a long sigh. This time, he did not scold him directly. Instead, he said earnestly,</p><p>“Your Eighth Uncle is an Innate Stage fighter who can fight against a Master Stage and a Higher Void level fighter who can fight against the Holy Emperor. However, he was still defeated by others for decades. Do you know how dangerous the outside world is?</p><p>“The Spiritual Cultivation World is filled with geniuses like your Eighth Uncle! And your Eighth Uncle couldn’t even defeat me back then!</p><p>“Can you defeat me? If you can’t, why don’t you go out and deliver vegetables?”</p><p>Cao Erzhu was submissive.</p><p>He couldn’t even beat his father with one hand, so how could he beat those geniuses outside?</p><p>But according to the rumors, there weren’t that many geniuses like his Eighth Uncle?</p><p>The giant in the backyard seemed to know what his child was thinking. His cold snort erupted like thunder, which caused the ceiling to roll and dust to fall:</p><p>“What’s the use of listening to all the rubbish from the neighbors?”</p><p>“Your father is from the same era as your Eighth Uncle. You don’t listen to my words, but you listen to the legends?”</p><p>Cao Erzhu was ashamed. What his father said made sense and seemed very civilized.</p><p>The giant in the backyard seemed to be determined to completely stop his child from running away from home. After a pause, he asked, “Have you mastered the Lightning Upanishad?”</p><p>“Still, just a little bit more.” Cao Erzhu was so ashamed that his face blushed a bright red.</p><p>“Humph! You haven’t even mastered the Upanishad, and you still want to go out and mingle?”</p><p>His father’s mocking voice was still as piercing as before:</p><p>“The outside world is full of Upanishad! I can easily give an example of Bazhun’an’s and Yu Mo’s deeds. Just think about how terrifying those people are?”</p><p>“Geniuses are everywhere, and you’re going out to hang yourself?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
