She was impressed by Xu Xiaoshou’s style of operation.</p><p>But clearly, the Void Suppression Stele did not pay any attention to the Four Pillars of Destiny Token, much less this rude person in front of it.</p><p>No matter how Xu Xiaoshou used the Command Token to intimidate it or how much he insulted it, he could not get any response.</p><p>“Damn it, it really ignored me.”</p><p>After cursing for a while, Xu Xiaoshou realized that the Void Suppression Stele was not bothered by his threats. Xu Xiaoshou stopped talking.</p><p>He did not dare to really use his sword to chop it down. After all, his life was important.</p><p>It was enough to fight it using a war of words. If he really angered this broken stone stele, what if a ray of light shot out from the inside and killed him? What would he do then?</p><p>“Leave a name…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his chin as he pondered.</p><p>“Could it be that only after he left a name, there would be a reaction?”</p><p>“Was that why so many seniors had left their names on this broken stone stele?”</p><p>“Why don’t you give it a try?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Lei Xi’er.</p><p>After all, he had already humiliated the Void Suppression Stele in this manner. Even if he left a name, the stone stele would probably not give him any treasures.</p><p>However, Lei Xi’er was different.</p><p>She was good-looking and was good natured. She was such a sharp contrast to him, maybe the Void Suppression Stele might prefer Lei Xi’er.</p><p>If she left her name behind, wouldn’t the chances of getting a treasure be much higher?</p><p>“I’ll give it a try.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was not afraid as she gathered her Spiritual Source.</p><p>Not long after, a sharp vine protruded from her palm. She wanted to leave her name on the Void Suppression Stele.</p><p>“Keng…”</p><p>However, when the vine came into contact with the Void Suppression Stele, it emitted a metallic sound.</p><p>She failed to leave her name!</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s vine did not damage the Void Suppression Stele at all, let alone manage to leave her name.</p><p>“Oh!” Xu Xiaoshou’s temper was starting to show. “Little stone stele, you still dare to bully my Junior Sister?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er looked over speechlessly, “…”</p><p>“Use this and slash it ruthlessly!” Xu Xiaoshou gave her an encouraging look. As he spoke, he even handed over the Fourth Sword.</p><p>Lei Xi’er looked down and glanced at the Fourth Sword that was filled with Devilish Energy. Then, she silently looked up at Xu Xiaoshou and did not say anything.</p><p>“Cursed, passive points + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>“Uh!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately reacted. If Lei Xi’er touched the Fourth Sword, she would probably die before she could leave her name.</p><p>“Negligence, negligence.”</p><p>With an awkward smile, Xu Xiaoshou handed over the Famed Sword Flame Python, “I have many swords. You can try again with this. It should be fine.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er did not say anything.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded and said, “Gu Qingyi was able to leave his name. It must be because of the Demonic Sword, Yue Lian. The first brother on the list can do it. The third brother on the list is also a brother. The Flame Python can definitely do it!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er: “The main thing is, will it agree?”</p><p>“Weng!”</p><p>As expected, the Flame Python vibrated violently and spat out flames, as if it resisted being used by others.</p><p>“Wait a moment.” Xu Xiaoshou said with a smile.</p><p>Turning around, he fiercely flicked the Famed Sword Flame Python with his finger and began to teach it a lesson:</p><p>“Are you stupid! This is one of us, and this is my Junior Sister!”</p><p>“Also, the Void Stele, Oh, this is the Void Stele on the Abyss Island. To be able to leave your name on it, how great of an honor is that?”</p><p>“You haven’t left your name on it, right? You also know the importance of fame to the Famed Sword, right? If you continue to be so arrogant, I’ll use the Fourth Sword to leave my name on it later, and you can go to the Yuan Mansion World yourself and have a good cry!”</p><p>“Too stupid, how could I raise such a stupid bunch of swords? You guys did not even want to grasp such a good opportunity.”</p><p>Deng Deng Deng Deng!</p><p>After Hidden Bitter came out, it jumped and played about on the ground like a child with boundless energy.</p><p>When it heard its owner’s lecture, it leapt up excitedly and jumped in front of Lei Xi’er.</p><p>“Buzz Buzz Buzz!”</p><p>“Use me, use me, Big Sister use me, I also want to leave my name in history!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pulled Hidden Bitter back unhappily. “Take a look at yourself, what rank are you at and you want to leave your name on the Void Stele? Who the hell do you think you are? Cultivate well. When you become a Famed Sword, you might be able to be put to good use.”</p><p>Hidden Bitter cried bitterly, “Sob, sob, sob…”</p><p>When the Flame Python saw this scene, it seemed to have realized that leaving a name was a good thing.</p><p>However, it still had its arrogant attribute. It was a little embarrassed and did not know how to lower its pride.</p><p>“Give me some face. Just do it.” Xu Xiaoshou gave it a way out.</p><p>The Flame Python hummed and the tip of the sword nodded and agreed.</p><p>Lei Xi’er watched this scene silently. She felt as if her outlook had changed.</p><p>“Was it because of Xu Xiaoshou? That was why all the swords around him were like this…”</p><p>“Or was it because she was ignorant?”</p><p>“Was this how the Ancient Swordsman trained his swords?”</p><p>“Suspected, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Here.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>After receiving the Flame Python, Lei Xi’er felt the surging power suppressed within it. She still could not understand the earlier scene.</p><p>Her sleeping spirit was awakened and she did not care anymore. With the Flame Python in hand, she turned around and stared at the Void Suppression Stele.</p><p>She did not activate any Spiritual Source.</p><p>However, this time, it was unexpectedly smooth. As the tip of the Flame Python’s Sword fell on the Void Suppression Stele, a rustling of stone chips could be heard. Soon, three beautiful words with sharp and cold edges were carved onto the monument.</p><p>“Lei Xi’er.”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>After the words were written, the Flame Python hummed. It seemed to have completed something that gave it a great sense of accomplishment. It flew back to Xu Xiaoshou’s hands joyfully.</p><p>“Where’s the treasure? Where’s the treasure?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held three swords in his hands and stared at the Void Suppression Stele. He shielded Lei Xi’er, wanting to see what transformation there would be.</p><p>After a long time.</p><p>“Hum!”</p><p>The Void Suppression Stele vibrated again and finally there was movement from within. Then there came a suppressed mechanical sound:</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
