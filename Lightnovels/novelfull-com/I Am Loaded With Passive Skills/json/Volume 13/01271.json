That was why he would not allow Sky City to fall like this.</p><p>Moreover, there were Saint Servant’s younger generation and the geniuses from First Pavilion in the Sky in Yunlun Mountain Range.</p><p>No matter what, these people could not die.</p><p>The rumbling sound became more and more ear-piercing.</p><p>Looking up, people could already see the edge of this ancient city burning with flames.</p><p>According to the original plan, Water Ghost was in charge of the mission about Sky City.</p><p>He had to hold on until Bazhun’an recovered before he could give the second order to make Sky City stop and float in the air.</p><p>However, doing so would be a waste of time.</p><p>Once Holy Divine Palace reacted and had Ai Cangsheng shot an arrow, Water Ghost would be unable to move and would have to take the arrow head-on. He would definitely die!</p><p>Holy Divine Palace probably would not shoot such an arrow for the sake of the Spiritual Cultivators of Yunlun Mountain Range.</p><p>However..</p><p>Bazhun’an stopped looking at the horizon and stared at Xiu Yuanke, who still had the heart of a child. He knew that he had a better choice now.</p><p>“Do you want to save them?” Bazhun’an asked with a smile.</p><p>Xiu Yuanke was stunned. “I do want to, but…”</p><p>He looked at the giant city in the sky and knew that if he wanted to resist the force, he would need to create a power as strong as destroying all the buildings in Fringe Moon Immortal City.</p><p>“I’m afraid I can’t do it…”</p><p>Xiu Yuanke swallowed and smiled wryly. How could he be so strong?</p><p>Bazhun’an didn’t question whether Xiu Yuanke could do it or not but glanced at Cen Qiaofu and Shui Gui, asking the two to give them some privacy.</p><p>After the two moved back dozens of feet, he raised his eyes and continued to look at the approaching giant city in the sky. Without turning his head, he said softly, “Ancient swordsman?”</p><p>“Ah?” Xiu Yuanke was stunned for a moment before he realized that his teacher was asking him a question. He immediately nodded and said, “Yes.”</p><p>“What sword techniques do you major in?” Bazhun’an’s dim eyes reflected the fire of the giant city.</p><p>“I know something about Nine Major Sword Techniques…” Xiu Yuanke said. Suddenly, his eyes lit up as he turned thrilled. “Sir, what do you mean?”</p><p>“Do you know Fantasy Sword Technique?” Bazhun’an asked calmly.</p><p>“Yes!” Xiu Yuanke nodded.</p><p>“What’s your level now?”</p><p>“The first realm, Space-Time Transition!”</p><p>“How long have you been learning swordsmanship?”</p><p>“Thirty-four years!” Xiu Yuanke did not hesitate. “Sir, I changed my major to ancient sword technique halfway through. Just like most people in Fringe Moon Immortal City, I was influenced by you… I never believed that you would die!”</p><p>“Thirty-four years, the first realm, changing of major halfway through…”</p><p>Bazhun’an muttered. Suddenly, his lips curled up. “Not bad.”</p><p>Xiu Yuanke’s face turned red. He scratched his head and said, “You are way stronger than me, sir.”</p><p>Bazhun’an shook his head slightly.</p><p>How could they be compared?</p><p>He paused for a moment, finally turned his head, looked at Xiu Yuanke to size him up, and said with a smile, “It’s very difficult for me to teach you sword cognition in a short period. You might be able to learn it if we meet up again in the future, but now…”</p><p>As he spoke, he squinted his eyes and looked at the mahogany sword case behind Xiu Yuanke.</p><p>“I can teach you a sword technique.</p><p>“However, with your current realm, you’ll either die or be injured after completing it!</p><p>“If that’s the case… are you willing to learn?”</p><p>Xiu Yuanke froze and didn’t know how to react for a moment.</p><p>Soon, his eyes widened, and even his body began to tremble with excitement. It was too much happiness.</p><p>He didn’t care to be dead or hurt, and Bazhun’an’s words only meant one thing to him..</p><p>Was he going to pass him a sword technique?</p><p>“Thud!” Xiu Yuanke kneeled on the ground, creating a huge crater. He didn’t even realize that his knees were bleeding, and his eyes were filled with sincerity.</p><p>“I am willing to die for the sword technique!”</p><p>Behind him, Cen Qiaofu, Shui Gui, and Shui Gui saw this scene, looked up at the huge city in the sky, and seemed to understand what was going to happen next.</p><p>“That’s rare!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu shook his head and sighed. “Thirty years ago, he was more arrogant and wouldn’t even care about a nobody like Xiu Yuanke!”</p><p>“But times have changed, right?” Shui Gui also muttered.</p><p>All of a sudden, the scene of the second time he had met Bazhun’an and been invited to join Saint Servant came to his mind.</p><p>At that time, the prodigy of the generation had already been beaten to the point that his saber was scattered, and he only had eight fingers on his hand.</p><p>Not to mention raising a sword, Bazhun’an hadn’t been considered a swordsman!</p><p>After receiving the invitation, Water Ghost laughed mockingly. “You can’t even hold a sword. Inviting me to join Saint Servant is a joke, right?”</p><p>However, even though his neck was scarred, his body was crippled, and even his eyes had lost the light, Bazhun’an had never given up.</p><p>“Now that my body is crippled, why not giving up my sword? All the swordsmen in the world are under my command! Let alone the fact that I can’t leave without a sword, I can’t do anything without the spirit!”</p><p>Such a peaceful response made Water Ghost realize that the man who had tried to overthrow the whole world alone was no longer there.</p><p>After being injured, he changed.</p><p>He had learned how to use his power and the title he had gained after three years, Eighth sword deity..</p><p>Men were his swords, and he would ascend to the clouds when the time came!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
