Then, he saw Huang Quan looking above. Suddenly, he knew what was happening.</p><p>“The demi-saint is here?” he asked in fear.</p><p>“That’s right,” said Xu Xiaoshou as he nodded.</p><p>Situ Yongren felt weak on his knees all of a sudden.</p><p>The demi-saint had arrived. Yet, Huang Quan could still be so calm. The demi-saint might be coming for his life!</p><p>“I beg upon you. Could you stop pretending now?”</p><p>“Elder…”</p><p>Situ Yongren intended to say something. But, he hesitated. In fact, he really wanted to shout out loud. “Run for your life and take me with you!”</p><p>After all, he already knew about the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan’s plot. With the demi-saint’s ability, it was not difficult for them to figure out that he had already known about it. Thus, both of them might be silenced!</p><p>However, both of them were on different sides. Hence, Situ Yongren was a little embarrassed to ask Huang Quan to bring him along.</p><p>“Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump!”</p><p>The Holy Emperor Dragon Scale was pumping faster and faster.</p><p>It meant that the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan had entered the Spell Forbidden Barrier in the deep sea. The speed in tracking the Power of Space-Time had increased drastically as well.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not know what kind of means did the other party use.</p><p>But, based on the demi-saint’s ability, it was so terrifying that he could feel the chill down his back.</p><p>“What are you afraid of?”</p><p>Even though Xu Xiaoshou was afraid, he still tried his best to suppress his fear and remain calm at all times. He looked at the void indifferently. In fact, he did not know what he was looking at. Then, he said, “There is a Spell Forbidden Barrier in the deep sea. Do you know how much combat strength the demi-saint would be left with after he entered the deep sea?”</p><p>“Although the combat strength of the demi-saint will be sealed, you did not seem to be any better, do you?” Situ Yongren almost blurted out the sentence. Fortunately, he managed to hold on to it.</p><p>In fact, the ability that Huang Quan could use under the Spell Forbidden Barrier was already beyond his expectation.</p><p>However, no matter what kind of means he had used to evade the seal of the barrier, there would still be a limit to it.</p><p>Furthermore…</p><p>If Huang Quan had his means to evade the seal, what made the demi-saint not have it?</p><p>Under such a situation where both parties were on par, how could the demi-saint win the Higher Void under the seals?</p><p>“Elder, are you thinking of a counter-attack now?” Situ Yongren stuttered as he asked. He could not see anyone else at that moment. But still, he could feel the chill down his spine. On a whim, he figured out that what Huang Quan said might be true.</p><p>With the great enemy approaching!</p><p>“Counter-attack?’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled.</p><p>He was still persisting.</p><p>He had to hold on till the end and force Situ Yongren into a desperate situation in order to let him join forces with him. Only then that he would be able to take down the overall situation.</p><p>“It is absolutely impossible to counter-attack him. He is a demi-saint after all. I am not stupid enough to fight him head-on. The most important thing now is…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around and gazed at Situ Yongren. Upon seeing how panicky he was right now, he said, “I shall take my leave first. Take care.”</p><p>As soon as he finished his words, he lifted his foot and released the spatial power with his hand. He was about to step into the vortex and teleport away.</p><p>“Wait! Elder, please wait!”</p><p>Situ Yongren’s face turned pale instantly. He became so anxious all of a sudden.</p><p>“What should I do after you left?”</p><p>“Should I say it out or not? With such a situation, the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan did not have to silence me at all. After he left, the deep water pressure would crush me for sure. How am I going to protect myself?”</p><p>“Elder, could you bring me along?” Finally, Situ Yongren spoke.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou twitched his mouth into a smile.</p><p>He had succeeded by using the mean, retreating to advance!</p><p>“Bring you along with me?”</p><p>He did not agree immediately. On the contrary, he teased him.</p><p>“You have to understand that you are the Holy Son of the Holy Divine Palace. But, I am from Yama, the dark faction.”</p><p>He continued, “We are of different sides. We will never be on the same page. What if someone bumps into us when we walk together?”</p><p>“I am afraid that before the arrival of the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan, you would not be able to defend yourself with such a ridicule act,” said Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>How could Situ Yongren not know the pros and cons now?</p><p>But the problem was, he had no other option to choose from at that moment.</p><p>All his protective spiritual weapons had been destroyed by Huang Quan. Wasn’t he being forced to the verge of the cliff now?</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Situ Yongren was so anxious that he already intended to scratch his head. However, he could still able to analyze the situation calmly and fight for himself.</p><p>“Elder, don’t worry about this now. As long as I can survive, these trivial matters could be settled easily.”</p><p>He then continued, “But the key point is that you and I are already on the same boat. Both of us are inseparable.”</p><p>“Besides, you have destroyed all my protective spiritual weapons. Aren’t you trying to force me into boarding the… Ahem! The same boat as you?” asked Situ Yongren.</p><p>“You need the help from Holy Divine Palace to fight against the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan. I need to survive to gather specific information about this situation to report to the Holy Divine Palace. Aren’t we on the same boat?”</p><p>Situ Yongren halted for a while. Obviously, he was very anxious. He gritted his teeth and said, “Well, why don’t we put it this way? You have a plan, and I want to make a contribution. Now, we have the same goal. In fact, you are helping yourself by helping me. Am I right?”</p><p>“You are calm indeed.” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were filled with admiration as he spoke.</p><p>This guy was indeed something. At this time, he could still bring out so many principles in order to stay alive.</p><p>However, wasn’t it Xu Xiaoshou’s initial intention?</p><p>Situ Yongren risked his life desperately to help him spread the rumor to defame both the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan and Yama. He also needed the backing of this fellow’s supreme master to intimidate the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan.</p><p>Therefore, he could actually agree to Situ Yongren’s request immediately.</p><p>However, what it meant by “leaving something at large” was to get both parties to be bound together tightly so that they could be more indistinguishable.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou ignored the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale that was pumping vigorously. He frowned as he said, “You have to think it through clearly. These are your requests, not mine. Okay?”</p><p>“Okay!” Situ Yongren nodded vigorously.</p><p>He knew very well that the other party was trying to leave something at large so that he could get it eventually.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
