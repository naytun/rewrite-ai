Some were very small and could only sit one person. Some were very large, so large that they didn’t seem to be for people to sit on. Instead, they seemed to be used as traps for giant beasts.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang pushed Ai Cangsheng’s wheelchair to the side of the main seat. After he walked the length of the round table, he slowly walked to the main seat and sat down. He looked over with a smile. “So, what do you think?”</p><p>“I’ll be an observer,” Ai Cangsheng said.</p><p>“You’re also a member of the Council, so you have to express your views.” Dao Qiongcang was helpless.</p><p>“I’ve seen enough. I’m very tired… if we really want to discuss the matter, it’s really up to the rest of you.” Ai Cangsheng paused for a moment and looked around the round table, “Moreover, this Council meeting is just for show only. With you, Dao Qiongcang present, is there anything in the world that can’t be predicted? Any outcome that can’t be foreseen?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang sighed, “There’s an error in the Divine Force. It’s not advisable to act arbitrarily. I still need your opinion to control the Divine Force.”</p><p>“That’s true.” Ai Cangsheng’s lips smirked as he looked at him in a strange manner. “But each time, wasn’t it only because you already had the final answer that the meeting was held? And each time, were you ever wrong?”</p><p>“I’m not afraid of ten thousand possibilities, I’m only afraid of a single possibility.” As someone who was aware of the secrets of the Divine Force, Dao Qiongcang had always a deep reverence for the Way of the Heavens and the Holy Path.</p><p>“He’s here…”</p><p>At this moment, Ai Cangsheng did not continue speaking. He turned his gaze towards the entrance of the Great Hall.</p><p>Just as he finished speaking.</p><p>The osmanthus flower on the Holy Mountain bloomed as a surge of Holy Power burst forth.</p><p>A faint light erupted from the horizon before transforming into a golden ray that converged into the Council Hall at the speed of light and transformed into an old figure.</p><p>“Hahaha, Dao Qiongcang, it’s been a long time since I’ve seen you!”</p><p>“What’s the purpose of holding a meeting this time?”</p><p>“Having said that, with your brains, why don’t you just do whatever you need to do? Why do you need us to come here in person?”</p><p>The Elder was dressed in a luxurious gold robe. Even his hair was light gold in color.</p><p>Along with his hearty laughter, a golden light flashed in his eyes. He looked at Dao Qiongcang and his aura didn’t diminish in the slightest. In fact, it even surpassed Dao Qiongcang’s.</p><p>One of the three Emperors of the Holy Divine Palace, Yan Wuse, Fire Attribute, Demi-Saint!</p><p>“Elder Yan.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang did not stand up. He only nodded with a smile to pay his respects.</p><p>This was an Elder. When the previous Hallmaster was around, he was a member of the Ten-member Council. Now, he rarely fought, so it was normal that he did not receive much attention from the world.</p><p>In terms of seniority, a Demi-Saint was naturally one level higher than Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>However, in terms of status, the current Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace would not even bow to the Holy Emperor, what more for a Demi-Saint?</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng also followed suit and greeted the Demi-Saint Yan Wuse with a slight nod.</p><p>He usually did not talk much, and he was too lazy to talk. Now, his legs were crippled, so it was even more impossible for him to stand up to greet him.</p><p>“Tsk Tsk.”</p><p>Yan Wuse shook his head helplessly. He could do nothing about these two people’s perfunctory attitude toward him as a senior.</p><p>However, he had arrived early after all, and he did not receive any welcome from the others. Thus, he brought his own misfortune upon himself and sat down alone.</p><p>“Hu…”</p><p>Outside the hall, a gentle breeze blew, and the Holy Power fluctuated again.</p><p>Then, a mocking voice sounded:</p><p>“Yan Wuse, are your eyes blind due to old age? Didn’t you see the Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict?”</p><p>“I hate official greetings like yours the most. If you have the ability, come out and fight!”</p><p>The sound of footsteps could be heard. This time, it was a black-clothed Elder carrying a broadsword walking over. He was very short and was roughly on the same level as Ye Xiaotian.</p><p>But strength, identity, status…</p><p>One of the three Emperors, Wei Feng, no Attributes, Swordsman, Demi-Saint!</p><p>“Senior Wei Feng.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang smiled and greeted him once again.</p><p>Wei Feng, God of Killing, was a legend during his era. He was also an old man with a bad temper and was the vanguard of the Council.</p><p>When he was young, he had killed all over the Five Regions. Now, he was much better. He was only interested in killing Saints.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng nodded indifferently once again.</p><p>Wei Feng, God of Killing was not someone to his liking. He was too murderous.</p><p>Although he was also an old Elder, he was also one of the three Emperors. He did not need to give face to anyone.</p><p>In this world, seniority did not depend on age. It only depended on the fists.</p><p>If the fist was strong, anyone could ignore it.</p><p>If he really wanted to, he could simply take care of any trivial matter.</p><p>However, it was clear that using the Eyes of the Great Path to stare at all living things was already very tiring. Ai Cangsheng did not have the extra energy to make meaningless greetings.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
