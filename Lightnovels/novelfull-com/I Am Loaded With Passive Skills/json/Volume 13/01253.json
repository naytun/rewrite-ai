He dared to pretend to be Cen Qiaofu in the presence of the original Cen Qiaofu.</p><p>The key was…</p><p>“What was in it for the old man to pretend to be him?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu looked at ‘himself’ in the Water Ball and was completely speechless.</p><p>It was easy for everyone to understand if you were pretending to be Bazhun’an. Bazhun’an himself was here, so he probably wouldn’t be blamed.</p><p>“However, I’m just a nameless Higher Void. I didn’t commit any big crimes nor did I accomplish any extraordinary battle achievements in my life.”</p><p>However, he was just an ordinary ‘One against 100 in the Eighth Palace’, an ordinary ‘woodcutter who cuts a path in one night.’</p><p>“Even if you pretended to be Water Ghost, you would have a better future than pretending to be Cen Qiaofu, right?”</p><p>The corners of Cen Qiaofu’s mouth twitched. He wanted to say something, but he hesitated. In the end, he had no choice but to look at Water Ghost.</p><p>Water Ghost also looked at him. After the two of them looked at each other, they suddenly burst out laughing at the same time.</p><p>“What are you laughing at?”</p><p>Xiu Yuanke felt that their laughter was filled with strong mockery. He was mortified and furious, but before he could say anything…</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Water Ghost waved his hand, and the Water-type Upanishad Formation started to spin beneath his feet, which prevented this guy from interrupting Bazhun’an’s spellcasting.</p><p>Xiu Yuanke felt his heart twitch, as if he was completely restrained by someone.</p><p>Just as he was about to speak, he felt a surge of power from the Water Ball seeping into his body’s muscles, bones, and veins. His entire body seemed to have been blocked off.</p><p>He couldn’t move at all!</p><p>“What kind of devilish ability…”</p><p>Xiu Yuanke was shocked.</p><p>He couldn’t make out what this ability was.</p><p>But he could clearly see the Power Upanishad Formation under the feet of the man with the Golden Beast mask!</p><p>“Water-type Upanishad?”</p><p>“This guy was Yu Lingdi?”</p><p>“? ? ?” Xiu Yuanke was stunned.</p><p>“How did Eldest Senior Brother get involved with Yu Lingdi, the Spirit Division Chief?”</p><p>“This, this, this…”</p><p>“No way?”</p><p>“Eldest Senior Brother was from the Holy Divine Palace?”</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Then there was only one explanation left…</p><p>“Yu Lingdi is one of us?”</p><p>“! ! !” Upon reaching this conclusion, Xiu Yuanke’s jaw dropped in shock.</p><p>He didn’t dare to resist for a moment, afraid that his actions would cause even more trouble.</p><p>Of course, the most important thing was that in this delicate situation, Eldest Senior Brother’s arrangements were obviously more important. It was best that he didn’t cause any more trouble.</p><p>His eyes darted around…</p><p>Xiu Yuanke garnered all his strength and glanced in Eldest Senior Brother’s direction.</p><p>He was still writing something on the Golden Scroll…</p><p>Xiu Yuanke could clearly feel the surging power on the scroll even though he was separated by the Water Ball.</p><p>“Holy Power…”</p><p>“Good, good…”</p><p>“My Eldest Senior Brother, what bigger scheme are you planning behind the Fringe Moon Immortal City’s back?”</p><p>At the side.</p><p>Bazhun’an’s attention was completely focused on the Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict.</p><p>He couldn’t sense the person behind him at all.</p><p>However, the fact that he was comfortable enough to leave his back wide open showed Bazhun’an’s absolute trust in Cen Qiaofu and Water Ghost’s abilities.</p><p>As the Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict was written in blood, the Will of the Holy Emperor on it became even more obvious. The golden light on the Lone Cliff that repelled the masses also pushed everyone out of the surrounding Land Realm.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu, Shui Gui, and Xiu Yuanke, who was in the Water Ball, were all attracted by this change and did not say anything more.</p><p>The three of them were forced back by the golden power. They stared at the unflinching back of ‘Bazhun’an Eldest Senior Brother’ who was trying his best to write the ancient text.</p><p>Finally, when the last word was written…</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict shook violently as if it had absorbed a full amount of power and was actually glowing with vitality.</p><p>At the same time, the surging power of the Holy Emperor erupted from it and the Water Ball that trapped Xiu Yuanke cracked.</p><p>However, at this moment, Xiu Yuanke acted like he was possessed.</p><p>Like Water Ghost and Cen Qiaofu, his knees trembled, and he was almost suppressed by the terrifying power of the Holy Emperor to the point of kneeling on the ground.</p><p>“Edict!”</p><p>Hearing this, the three of them tried their best to look up.</p><p>As far as they could make out, in the Acquired Realm, Bazhun’an Eldest Senior Brother broke away from the suppressive pressure and slowly floated in the air. This was obviously the Holy Emperor’s power to receive people of high status.</p><p>At this moment, although Bazhun’an’s state became even more dispirited due to writing the edict, his entire body was bathed in the golden light emitted by the Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict, as if a God had descended.</p><p>The clouds and mist swirled around him, accompanied by a cool breeze.</p><p>Before long, under the guidance of all living things in the world, Bazhun’an floated above the Nine Heavens.</p><p>He held the Golden Edict with both hands, and his gaze was solemn. He gazed upon the Five Regions and Four Seas as if he could swallow the mountains and rivers with his aura.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Without further delay, he stood in front of the Nine Heavens.</p><p>Bazhun’an casually flung the Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict away, which turned into a stream of light and merged into the Way of the Heavens.</p><p>…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>In the Yunlun mountain range, the Nine Heavens shook.</p><p>The sky shattered like a mirror. A golden spot bloomed in front of everyone’s eyes, and then it shone like the blazing sun.</p><p>Soon after, the pressure of the sky descended.</p><p>At this moment, be it the Guardian who was fighting for the Nine Dragon Range, the Trial-taker who was wandering around the inner and outer regions, the Trial-taker who was searching for his own opportunity, or the Trial-taker who had sneaked into this world, the Trial-taker from the Cutting path stage or the Higher Void level…</p><p>None of them prostrated or crashed to the ground in fear!</p><p>“It’s… It’s happening again… ?”</p><p>The Trial-takers were confused.</p><p>“How many times had it been!”</p><p>“Could they still allow the Imperial City trial to continue as normal?”</p><p>There was the battle of the Saint and the suppression of the Black Dragon; there was the person who controlled the sea, the Trident Exterminating Sin Bow; and now, there was this Golden Sun falling into the world and tens of thousands of people prostrating…</p><p>Did Dongtianwang City commit some kind of sin!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
