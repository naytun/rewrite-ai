Maybe you can bring the information out of this place after going there.</p><p>“Remember, if you manage to get out of here, tell Rao yaoyao that no one is allowed to enter this island unless they are at Saint Stage!” he sighed helplessly.</p><p>Yu Lingdi had kept his hopes, but now he was completely in despair.</p><p>After saying this, a stream of light flew out from his body.</p><p>Gu Qingyi stretched out his hand and caught it. It was a command token.</p><p>“Void token.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi glanced at him and said, “Find the city gates. With this void token, you will be able to return to Shengshen Continent.”</p><p>Gu Qingyi took the void token but fell silent.</p><p>His idea was to explore the legendary Sky City before going home but not returning without seeing anything.</p><p>After all, there were many opportunities here.</p><p>If it was possible, Gu Qingyi didn’t want to just stroll around and leave without any gains.</p><p>This was too ridiculous!</p><p>Countless people couldn’t get their hands on the foundational roots of Saint Ascension! He came here early, so how could he go back without searching?</p><p>However, after looking at the void token in his hand and the young man on the pole…</p><p>“Why did you go up?” Gu Qingyi asked.</p><p>Having the void token meant that he could return home, so he was not in a hurry at the moment.</p><p>Now, he was curious about why Yu Lingdi had gotten onto this totem pole without anyone else.</p><p>“There was someone.” Yu Lingdi glossed over.</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>Yu Lingdi stayed silent.</p><p>Obviously, he didn’t want to answer this question.</p><p>Gu Qingyi held the void token and suddenly smiled. “I can help you bring the information out, but I’m more interested in this place than this mission… If you don’t tell me, I might as well explore this place first.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi still didn’t say a word.</p><p>He had already expected this situation.</p><p>By the time Gu Qingyi finished exploring this island, the information might already be outdated.</p><p>However, he still chose to give him the void token..</p><p>He had no choice!</p><p>This was the only way to solve the problem!</p><p>At this moment, Yu Lingdi was filled with hatred. Why was the first person to come here and see him not someone from Holy Divine Palace or close to them? Even anyone wanting to have a connection with them was better.</p><p>Gu Qingyi..</p><p>The ancient swordsman’s power, wealth, and influence in Burial Sword Tomb probably could not satisfy or force him.</p><p>Curiosity and interest might be the only two things that could influence Gu Qingyi’s decision at this moment.</p><p>“Bazhun’an.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi finally said this name. “I encountered Bazhun’an and was chased to Saint Punishment Square. In the end, he tied me to Saint Punishment Pillar.”</p><p>“Saint Punishment Square..</p><p>Saint Punishment Pillar…” Gu Qingyi muttered to himself.</p><p>As expected, the Spirit Division Chief knew much more about this place than he did.</p><p>“Saint Punishment…”</p><p>From these similar names, it was not difficult to see what the true meaning of this square and the totem pillar was.</p><p>However..</p><p>“Why did Bazhun’an tie you to Saint Punishment Pillar?” Gu Qingyi was curious.</p><p>He was not only curious about this but also about why Bazhun’an was here. Moreover, he wanted to know what kind of battle it had been between them and how powerful Bazhun’an’s combat strength was… and so on.</p><p>However, it was unlikely that Yu Lingdi, who had been defeated and tied up here, would go into detail about how he was humiliated and bound. That was Gu Qingyi directly cut to the point.</p><p>“I also want to know…” There was confusion in Yu Lingdi’s eyes when he heard the question.</p><p>He was tied up to Saint Punishment Pillar but did not experience the so-called Saint Punishment. Instead, he felt that Saint Punishment Pillar was constantly absorbing the spiritual source in his body.</p><p>However, the speed of absorbing the spiritual source was too weak for a Spiritual Cultivator who had cut the path after fulfilling his Dao realm!</p><p>Yu Lingdi could deal with the loss of his spiritual source just by relying on the basic recovery speed of the energy reserve from his spiritual source.</p><p>He felt that he would have to hang here for a long time until Bazhun’an achieved his goal!</p><p>“You don’t know either?”</p><p>Gu Qingyi frowned and asked again, “Then what have happened since you were hung here?”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Yu Lingdi’s body suddenly convulsed violently.</p><p>At the same time, the entire Saint Punishment Square lit up, and the path pattern formed by water-type Upanishad instantly burst out with light.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
