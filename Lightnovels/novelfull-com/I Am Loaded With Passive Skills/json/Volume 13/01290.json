Holy Miracle Fruit! (2)</p><p>It was so difficult to achieve demi-saint. One needed to reach the peak of Spiritual Cultivation and be a demi-saint person.</p><p>Holy Emperor was even more unachievable!</p><p>Based on the understanding of the higher void (level) memory of Double Dumba*s, Holy Emperor indeed existed on the continent.</p><p>However, there seemed to be only 18 Holy Emperor persons on the entire continent. As for the additional, Double Dumba*s didn’t have any idea.</p><p>But he didn’t hope for the Holy Emperor.</p><p>He had a chance in demi-saint!</p><p>This was also why he was attracted by Xu Xiaoshou’s head. It was because the Black Gold Bounty had promised the foundational roots of Saint Ascension-related resources.</p><p>He had thought that he was against the path of Saint Ascension due to his failure in hunting Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He had never thought that he would enter Abyss Island and come to this place that was suspected to be the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer. How could Double Dumba*s resist this?</p><p>Restrictions and barriers were nothing to him.</p><p>On the surface, Double Dumba*s had a gold attribute. In reality, when his innate attribute was awakened, he had a second special attribute, Dissolve.</p><p>The ability of the Dissolve attribute could dissolve his body into molecules without any energy characteristics. They could invade anywhere without being discovered.</p><p>It was with this method that Double Dumba*s could dissolve his body and enter the bodies of others, and then completed the feat of successfully hunting the veteran higher void (level) after entering the higher void (level).</p><p>He could even enter a human body. The restrictions and barriers of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer could block living beings, but it definitely could not block “molecules” that were like dead objects!</p><p>With this method, Double Dumba*s successfully entered the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>After that, he was shocked.</p><p>“Too much! It’s too much!”</p><p>In the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, spiritual ingredients filled with a strong aura were everywhere.</p><p>With just a glance, it was a feast for the eyes without an end.</p><p>It wasn’t a dream!</p><p>Here, there were at least first and second-grade weeds. Holy Medicine was countless too… It was far more exaggerated than what Double Dumba*s had imagined!</p><p>After all, no one had ever set foot in this ideal world before.</p><p>The medicinal herbs grew and died, and then grew again. The process iterated. The medicinal herbs grew from one to two, two to three, and three to ten thousand…</p><p>“This is a fairyland!”</p><p>Double Dumba*s watched with fervor, and his rationality instantly disappeared.</p><p>He reached out his hand and plucked the rare Holy Medicines in front of him–the fruit on the Holy Miracle Tree. It was the head-sized Holy Miracle Fruit that he was holding in his arms.</p><p>This Holy Miracle Fruit was extremely powerful.</p><p>It was a super Holy Miracle Fruit that allowed a Spiritual Cultivator below demi-saint to generate the first wisp of Holy Power from his energy reserve after eating the fruit!</p><p>After the unattributed Holy Power from the Holy Miracle Fruit was generated, it would continue to digest the medicinal effects of the fruit. After some time, it would undergo a qualitative change and possess the characteristics of self-growth and strengthening.</p><p>In other words, even if Double Dumba*s hadn’t obtained the “demi-saint person” yet…</p><p>As long as he ate this Holy Miracle Fruit, he would become the first higher void (level) below the demi-saint!</p><p>A higher void (level) with Holy Power!</p><p>He might even be able to defeat the Eighth Sword Deity!</p><p>After that, no matter how long it took for him to obtain the demi-saint person, the Holy Power of the Holy Miracle Fruit would be converted into his own Holy Power, allowing Double Dumba*s to separate from the initial realm of demi-saint.</p><p>He could even be comparable to a veteran demi-saint!</p><p>It was simply a supreme treasure that a higher void (level) could consume the Holy Blood all the time without any side effects. And after becoming a demi-saint, one could advance successfully and instantly complete the qualitative transformation from Spiritual Cultivation to Saint Ascension!</p><p>How could Double Dumba*s not go crazy when he saw this?</p><p>He picked a Holy Miracle Fruit.</p><p>Before he ate it.</p><p>The Herb Garden of Divine Farmer buzzed and the sky turned dark.</p><p>An ancient giant that was more than a thousand feet tall pushed away the dust at his feet and stood up.</p><p>“?”</p><p>Double Dumba*s was dumbfounded.</p><p>He recognized it at a glance. This ancient giant that had the power to kill a higher void (level) with one punch was none other than the void attendant that guarded the ruins of Abyss Island in his memories!</p><p>“But why is the void attendant so huge?</p><p>“No one has told me that the void attendant looks like this!</p><p>“How is this a f*cking ‘attendant’? It should be called a ‘void giant’!”</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>Double Dumba*s quickly ran away.</p><p>He did not even dare to pick the extra fruit on the Holy Miracle Tree.</p><p>But even so, with a Holy Miracle Fruit in his arms, the void attendant’s eyes turned red as he stared at him.</p><p>With a step.</p><p>He stepped across the space.</p><p>With a bang, Double Dumba*s couldn’t react in the first instant and his body was stomped into pieces.</p><p>Fortunately, he had turned into his molecular form in time and was only severely injured. Thus he didn’t die on the spot.</p><p>At the critical moment, he threw out the Holy Miracle Fruit and then caught it. Thus he didn’t cut off his path to Saint Ascension.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>After that, he continued to run wildly.</p><p>The Holy Miracle Fruit contained boundless Holy Power. The moment it was placed into the spatial ring, the ring exploded.</p><p>His body was blown up and so many treasures were blown away. Double Dumba*s did not have time to feel sorry for himself. At this moment, he only wanted to protect the Holy Miracle Fruit, which was his only hope.</p><p>However, the strange gravity and the strange order of Abyss Island made it difficult for him to resist. It was also difficult for him to escape.</p><p>Therefore, after enduring the pain and being crushed a few more times, Double Dumba*s finally used his escape spiritual technique–Nine Chasing Clouds!</p><p>Nine Chasing Clouds transformed his legs into a cloud that possessed extremely high speed.</p><p>To be honest, this spiritual technique of the higher void (level) wasn’t as fast as using the escape techniques after merging with the Way of the Heavens.</p><p>But there was no other way!</p><p>This was Sky City.</p><p>The strange Order of the Heavens in the surroundings completely repelled Spiritual Cultivators from merging with their bodies.</p><p>Being helpless, Double Dumba*s could only use the spiritual technique of escape that he had eliminated for more than ten years.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
