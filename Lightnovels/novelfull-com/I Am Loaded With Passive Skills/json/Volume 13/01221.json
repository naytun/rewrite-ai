The dragon shouted out at the person who chased after it, “Yama, Water Ghost?”</p><p>Bai Lian raised his eyebrows. He had never heard of this before.</p><p>Teng Shanhai immediately looked at Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s pale face, which appeared weak because she had saved too many people, also had her doubts. She had never heard of this too.</p><p>“This old body has heard of it…”</p><p>Granny Tianling raised her hand meekly and said, “The dragon is a Gold-swallowing dragon. It almost came toward this old body. Fortunately, it veered off in another direction and this old body stayed far away in order to avoid the danger.”</p><p>Teng Shanhai nodded.</p><p>He would have done the same thing.</p><p>“Who would want to encounter danger under the Spell Forbidden Barrier in the Deep Sea?”</p><p>At that time, he had seen and heard Yama Water Ghost, chasing after a dragon from afar. He had thought that this was a person who could move freely within the Spell Forbidden Barrier. He had also exchanged an arrow with Ai Cangsheng in the Yunlun Mountain Range and was not at a disadvantage…</p><p>“Who would dare to approach?”</p><p>Teng Shanhai felt that he managed to make a quick escape, which was why he was still alive.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was stunned by this information. “So, this arrangement is not the work of the Saint Servant, but what is Yama planning? They are even coveting Sky City?”</p><p>She thought of Yama, Huang Quan, whom she had met on the Lone Cliff.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao suddenly felt that her speculation might come true. “Otherwise, why would Huang Quan go to the Lone Cliff by himself?”</p><p>His goal was to lead himself and the people of the Holy Divine Palace to the center of the layout!</p><p>“Ah, yes, yes, yes…” Xu Xiaoshou nodded repeatedly, holding the cat in his arms while still in the Disappearing State. He didn’t expect that his previous act of framing would have such a wonderful effect.</p><p>But in the next second, Bai Lian spoke.</p><p>“Could it be that he’s out to frame him and trying to shift the blame to him?” Bai Lian expressed his doubts.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: “? ? ?”</p><p>“Don’t say that!”</p><p>“It shouldn’t be.” At this moment, the taciturn Ye Xiao spoke up, “Little Ninja, the Three Incenses’ Gold Hunting Token killer has no enmity with Yama. I don’t think they’ll go to that extent.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: “Huh…”</p><p>“The Three Stooges killed Zhuge Liang.”</p><p>“Then I really don’t know.”</p><p>Bai Lian spread his hands and looked at his Supreme Master. He realized that he still had no intention of speaking, so he said solemnly, “This is all I can figure out. After all, I’m new here and I don’t know the root of many things…”</p><p>Having repaid Rao Yaoyao for saving him, he didn’t want to continue to help her. He immediately changed the topic and stared at Rao Yaoyao:</p><p>“Sword Deity Rao, there’s something that I might need your help with.”</p><p>“That disciple of mine has fallen into the water too. She’s only at the Sovereign Stage. Although she has elixirs on her, she might not be able to hold on for long.”</p><p>“Since there’s nothing going on here, why don’t you do me a favor and help to bring my disciple here as well?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was still immersed in the bigger picture. She didn’t expect Bai Lian to suddenly change the subject to a personal matter. Her expression turned ugly.</p><p>“If it wasn’t to save the two of you from the Holy Palace, why would I waste the power of the Cang Godhood Sword?”</p><p>“Now that the matter has not been settled, and with the risk of not being able to find anyone at all, why would I still waste my time on your disciple?”</p><p>“How great do you think your disciple is?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao did not want to bother with Bai Lian at all. She turned her head to look at the Void Gate, and Dao Qiongcang’s warning before she fell into the water flashed in her mind:</p><p>“Enter from the bottom of the Lone Cliff, retrieve the ‘Sea God’s Trident’, try to find out the identity of the person holding the Trident and seize the opportunity!”</p><p>Yama, Water Ghost, emerged from the water.</p><p>As for the opportunity…</p><p>“This should be the ‘opportunity’ that Dao Qiongcang was talking about, right?”</p><p>Without any hesitation, Rao Yaoyao said :</p><p>“Since this door leads to Abyss Island, and since the sacrificial ritual can no longer be stopped, the fruits of Sky City have yet to fall into their hands…</p><p>“If we don’t enter the tiger’s den, how can we obtain the tiger’s cub?”</p><p>Granny Tianling’s face turned green when she heard this, and her lips involuntarily quivered.</p><p>As expected, in the next second, Rao Yaoyao turned her head and looked at her:</p><p>“You, go and push the door.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
