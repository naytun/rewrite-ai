So the Sword God is actually me? I’m the reincarnation of the Sword God?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Of course, some people were still stuck in their own world and didn’t want to wake up.</p><p>“Who is the strongest at the end of Spiritual Cultivation? Eeverything is in our mind!”</p><p>“Haha, come, my baby girl! Come to me!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Su Qianqian and Gu Qing stared at the resplendent sword light with infatuation from the Eighth Dragon Range, still obsessed with their fantasy.</p><p>In the midst of the white snow, Su Qianqian held the Epitaph of City Snow in her hand, beheaded Bazhun’an, and turned around. However, what she saw was endless loneliness.</p><p>“Grandpa, dad…”</p><p>“I’ve already avenged your death, but where are you…”</p><p>She couldn’t see where to go in the wilderness.</p><p>She had finally avenged their death and killed the guy destroying the Su family.</p><p>However, everything still didn’t go back to how it was before..</p><p>Su Qianqian held the huge snow-white sword and squatted down, sobbing softly.</p><p>The scene changed. Su Qianqian was about to be sent to Tiansang Spirit Palace to take refuge in the starry night.</p><p>“Grandpa, why so many people want to steal our family’s sword? Why are they not afraid of death? They are so weak…” Su Qianqian sat on the steps of the front yard of the Su family, hugging her knees as she looked at the night sky. She understood nothing.</p><p>Grandpa lovingly touched her head, smiled, and said, “Everyone is following our dream and chasing their goral. We all have something greater in our hearts. They want the famed sword to reach the top. As the aristocratic family of sword owner, we can only protect our glory. That’s all.”</p><p>“Then what is something greater in your heart, Grandpa?”</p><p>“Of course, it’s you.”</p><p>“Oh, no, no, no! I’m not talking about that. I’m talking about… What’s your goal?”</p><p>“My goal…” Her grandpa looked at the starry sky with hope in his eyes. “My biggest dream is to be able to see Second World before I die.”</p><p>“Second World? What’s that?”</p><p>“That is the greater world where every swordsman yearns for it!”</p><p>“Well, not for me.”</p><p>“You are still young, hahaha…”</p><p>Grandpa touched Su Qianqian’s head again, suddenly stopped laughing, and became much more serious.</p><p>“My baby girl, don’t forget that we live for something greater but not hatred!”</p><p>“If someone takes my life one day, that will be the battle for the famed sword. It is nothing new, alright?”</p><p>“You must never forget it. You must not let your hatred get to your head and go off the deep end. The only purpose of your life is to chase after something greater in your heart!”</p><p>Su Qianqian shook her head. “Grandpa, what are you talking about? You will never be defeated!”</p><p>Grandfather laughed. “Of course! I am the strongest swordsman! There is no one better than me! Hmm, maybe there will be because I will be the second when you grow up. You will be the best swordsman, right?”</p><p>“Yes!” Su Qianqian waved her fists with an excited face.</p><p>The scene changed again. Su Qianqian returned to the Su family’s courtyard, and the third uncle had given her the pearl of inheritance.</p><p>The pearl of inheritance recorded the battle between her grandfather and Bazhun’an.</p><p>The final move was her grandfather’s Space-time Transition. Afterward, he jumped into Bazhun’an’s Second World and left his last words.</p><p>“I am willing to die for swordsmanship.”</p><p>“Wah…” Su Qianqian’s memories gradually cleared up, and she burst into tears.</p><p>She was only 14 years old, and she still couldn’t quite understand what her third uncle and grandfather meant by what they said. At this moment, she still hated the person who had ruined all her happiness.</p><p>But..</p><p>As an ancient swordsman who had already received the inheritance, Su Qianqian also understood what her current situation was.</p><p>“Second World…”</p><p>“Grandfather, I am at the Second World, somewhere greater, but why am I alone here…”</p><p>The sobbing gradually became softer.</p><p>Su Qianqian wiped away her tears, pulled up the Epitaph of City Snow, glanced at the eight corpses by her feet, and woke up.</p><p>“I’m sorry, grandpa, I’ve gone off the deep end as you said…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
