I’m afraid the judicial department will only give us face if Lord Nine Sacrifices is involved.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang smiled and put the matter aside for the moment. He returned to the main topic. “Everyone, eight of the Ten-member Council are here. I’m sure you all know why.”</p><p>“Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict?”</p><p>One of the three Emperors, Demi-Saint Yan Wuse, had a hint of killing intent in his eyes. He said, “It’s that Bazhun’an again. If we need to make a move this time, I can cooperate.”</p><p>“Are you sure it’s not for personal revenge?” Wei Feng, God of Killing sneered.</p><p>He knew that Yan Wuse had a disciple with a Light Attribute. He seemed to have died at the hands of the Bazhun’an during a mission.</p><p>“I’ve delayed for too long. That junior has become very arrogant. I need to exercise my muscles and bones.” Yan Wuse, God of Killing turned around.</p><p>“It’s still an uncertainty whether you can beat him or not.” Wei Feng, God of Killing continued to mock.</p><p>Bazhun’an was a name that he had heard many times over the years.</p><p>The Master of the Black and White Veins of Abyss Island, the leader of the younger generation, and the Master of the Nine Major Sword Techniques. He was almost on par with You Tu…</p><p>Even if he had not reached the Demi-Saint cultivation level, it would not be difficult for him to break through before he died, right?</p><p>Seeing that the two in front of him were about to come to blows because of a few words… Dao Qiongcang quickly seized control of the situation. “The Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict is one thing, but this small matter isn’t enough to bring everyone together. The bigger reason is actually Abyss Island.”</p><p>“Abyss Island?” Yan Wuse looked over.</p><p>“Wait a minute.” Elder Yu spoke up. He glanced at Zhong Yuanzi, who was still studying the blasting plan on the paper. He sighed and said,</p><p>“Matters have to be resolved one at a time. Even I have heard of Bazhun’an. He is not an ordinary person. Tell me about the solution to the Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict first.”</p><p>Everyone turned their heads and looked at Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>To be honest, before Dao Qiongcang took office, everyone did not behave in such a manner.</p><p>The Ten-member Council would give their opinions. In the end, the Hallmaster would make the decision or reject it with a vote.</p><p>However, ever since this unpredictable young man took office, everyone realized that no matter how much they discussed, the final result would always be the same as what he had decided on earlier.</p><p>As time passed, everyone lost the concept of ‘thinking’.</p><p>If there were problems, you would come up with a plan and a final decision would be made. If there was not a big deal, then the matter would be settled. After that, the meeting would be adjourned and everyone would return to their own homes.</p><p>This was the current deliberation process of the Ten-member Council.</p><p>Seeing so many pairs of eyes that showed no signs of having any thoughts looking over, Dao Qiongcang pondered for a moment and helplessly said,</p><p>“My idea is…</p><p>“Ever since I fought Bazhun’an across the space in the Yunlun Mountain Range, he drew the world’s initial attention to the foundational roots of Saint Ascension on Abyss Island… There’s no doubt that this is just the beginning.”</p><p>“The Sky City gradually appeared, and the Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict was the last straw that broke the camel’s back, as it pulled it completely out of the Spatial Fragment… without a doubt, this was Bazhun’an’s affirmation of Sky City’s foundational roots of Saint Ascension in the eyes of the world.”</p><p>“And no matter how torturous the process was, how many dubious characters appeared, how much right and wrong were derived.”</p><p>“We jumped out and looked at the big picture.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang paused for a moment. He had the pearl of wisdom in his hand, and he was confident in his mind:</p><p>“It’s not difficult to see that this entire game of chess was played by one person.”</p><p>“From the beginning of the Abyss Island Rift until the arrival of the Abyss Island… If I’m not mistaken, this person also wants to go to the Abyss Island. Perhaps it’s not just the Outer island, but the Inner Island as well.”</p><p>“The others were just illusions. From the beginning to the end, Bazhun’an was the only chess player.”</p><p>“It’s obvious, isn’t it?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
