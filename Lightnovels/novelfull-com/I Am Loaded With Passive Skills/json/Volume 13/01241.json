He intended to use the space-time attributes to teleport out of this dangerous place with Situ Yongren.</p><p>However, no matter how hard he tried, he could still unable to move, not even his eyelids.</p><p>The pressure from the three realms of the Sovereign was not that obvious to the master stage, especially when Xu Xiaoshou had a full set of passive skills.</p><p>However, in the face of the demi-saint, it would be a crushing blow for the master stage.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Even though he could not move, he still had his mind control.</p><p>Under the Spell Forbidden Barrier, the strength of a demi-saint would not be as ridiculous that he could control one’s mind forcefully.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had no choice but to reveal some of his trump cards.</p><p>He could only pin all his hopes onto some of his trump cards. Indeed, in the form of appearance, it would be impossible to see through his tricks with naked eyes and experiences.</p><p>Thus, the demi-saint, Jiang Buyi, should not be able to deduce their true identities.</p><p>Therefore…</p><p>“Vanishing Technique!”</p><p>With a thought, Xu Xiaoshou’s figure disappeared on the spot!</p><p>The reason why Xu Xiaoshou was so confident in being reckless was all because of the possession of his Awakening Skill.</p><p>But, he had disappeared indeed.</p><p>Situ Yongren, who was beside him, was so nervous now. He was shocked to see Lord Huang Quan abandon him at such a critical moment and ran away instead.</p><p>“Fuck!”</p><p>Situ Yongren’s mind was blown instantly. His handsome face twisted awkwardly all of a sudden.</p><p>Didn’t they agree to get out of here together?</p><p>What happened to the so-called honesty?</p><p>How about a tiny bit of trust among people?</p><p>He was not going to talk about it anymore, right?</p><p>Those promises that they made in confidence earlier on were all rubbish! Situ Yongren sighed.</p><p>He trusted the wrong people.</p><p>Situ Yongren was stunned after cursing and swearing in his mind.</p><p>Upon seeing the demi-saint, Jiang Buyi, standing right in front of him without being affected by the water pressure. He felt that his doom was just around the corner.</p><p>“Humiliated, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Condemned, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The information bar kept popping up like crazy.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not expect that his escape would attract such a strong reflection from SItu Yongren.</p><p>However, he did not intend to abandon Situ Yongren.</p><p>After all, Situ Yongren was a useful protective talisman to him.</p><p>“Come in, Situ Yongren!”</p><p>In the disappearing state, Xu Xiaoshou managed to condense the spatial teleportation vortex. He used his finger to connect reality with the void. He threw the voice via the spatial vortex to reach out to the young man who was in stun.</p><p>Of course, he could take Situ Yongren directly without the need to speak to him.</p><p>But, he could not do so.</p><p>He should fool Situ Yongren till the end.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wanted Situ Yongren to be in a cahoot with Huang Quan of Yama. He wanted Jiang Buyi, the demi-saint to witness everything so that it would be embedded in his mind forever.</p><p>“You are still here?”</p><p>Situ Yongren did not think too much at first.</p><p>Suddenly, he saw a light in the darkness of despair. He stepped into the vortex without further hesitation. He was so afraid that Jiang Buyi would stop him from leaving if he did not react fast enough.</p><p>It was until the dazzling light of the Spell Forbidden Barrier triggered…</p><p>It was until the spatial vortex disappeared as he teleported Situ Yongren away…</p><p>In fact, Situ Yongren did not wait for Jiang Buyi to do anything to stop him.</p><p>Before he was teleported, he glanced his last gaze at the Elder not far away from him. he was surprised to see that Jiang Buyi’s expression was filled with shock and disbelief.</p><p>“What is going on?”</p><p>Situ Yongren was confused at first. Then, he realized something and went out of his mind again.</p><p>“What the fuck! What the fuck! What the fuck!”</p><p>“Why did he call my name just now?”</p><p>Obviously, Jiang Buyi had forgotten that they had met each other before at the demi-saint clan’s celebration.</p><p>After all, no matter how talented he was, Situ Yongren was just a small fry to demi-saint. It was normal for Jiang Buyi not to remember his name!</p><p>In addition, he was too down and out right now. He looked completely different from his previous magnificence. In fact, Jiang Buyi’s attention was on Lord Huang Quan. Therefore, it was reasonable for Jiang Buyi not to recognize his face.</p><p>However, Huang Quan shouted his name before the teleportation.</p><p>Wasn’t it equivalent to putting Situ Yongren at stake?</p><p>Even though he managed to escape eventually, if the demi-saint, Jiang Buyi, did not die, he would definitely use all his means to track him down in the future!</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Vanishing Technique plus spatial vortex plus shouting out his name aloud plus teleportation. Everything happened so fast that it was only in a blink of an eye.</p><p>Situ Yongren had escaped from a dead end. In the end, he could not stand Lord Huang Quan’s torturous act anymore. Thus, he questioned Huang Quan, “Why? Why do you want to expose my identity?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled as he said, “If I didn’t call you, the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan would not be stunned. Do you think you can enter the spatial vortex and teleport so smoothly if he was not in stun?”</p><p>Situ Yongren was stunned. However, he could still unable to calm himself down. He then said seriously, “You can use other means, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said, “In the moment of desperation, that is the only way to do it.”</p><p>“Crack!” Situ Yongren’s knuckles made a crisp crackling as he clenched his fingers into fists. His face had turned ghastly at that moment. Obviously, he was extremely angry right now.</p><p>“Glared At, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shifted his gaze from that fellow’s fist to his face. He then said in a serious tone, “Why? Do you have a problem with it?”</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>“Problem? What problem?”</p><p>Situ Yongren put on a wry smile. He regained his own self again as he placed his fists right in front of his chest. Then, he took a 90-degree bow and gritted his teeth.</p><p>“Thank you for saving my life, Elder.”</p><p>“I will never forget your life-saving grace!”</p><p>…</p><p>On the other side of the deep sea.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s face darkened. He stood in the same spot for quite some time. But, he did not seem to have any intention to attack or chase after them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
