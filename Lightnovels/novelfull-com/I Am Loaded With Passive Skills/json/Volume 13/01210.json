As long as I don’t go back to those places with the Spell Forbidden Barrier, with your current strength and my strength, as long as no demi-saint comes out of the five regions, you can do whatever you want.”</p><p>“So, why do you want to go to the Lone Cliff?”</p><p>Mo Mo replied calmly, “Outside the Eighth Palace, you have already promised Bazhun’an that you will protect Xu Xiaoshou. People have to keep their word. Have you forgotten the guarantee you made yourself?”</p><p>“Of course I keep my word!” Feng Yujin was furious, “But now is such a good opportunity. You have been separated from him. We can use this opportunity to help him clear the obstacles outside of Lone Cliff. Isn’t this a different kind of protection? Do you know what it means to contribute secretly?”</p><p>Mo Mo stopped her step and did not say anything. She only reached out her hand and pressed the sound recording bead.</p><p>“Feng Yujin, please cooperate.”</p><p>This monotonous and emotionless voice instantly provoked a certain someone’s anger.</p><p>“F*ck you, Demonic Emperor Black Dragon!” Feng Yujin cursed, “Mo Mo! Now, immediately! Crush it for me!”</p><p>“I won’t.”</p><p>“If you don’t crush it, do you believe that I will seize your body and then crush it?!”</p><p>“Don’t you dare. I will never speak to you again.”</p><p>“Haha!” Feng Yujin was so angry that he was amused. “Do you really think that I need you to chat with me?”</p><p>Mo Mo was silent.</p><p>She didn’t have any other tool that could be used to restrain this temperamental Holy Emperor Fengtian.</p><p>But when a person was not afraid of death, would he or she still care about the interpersonal relationship or manner?</p><p>Mo Mo pressed the sound recording bead again.</p><p>“Feng Yujin, please cooperate.”</p><p>“Ahhhh!!!”</p><p>A maniacal and ear-piercing roar instantly sounded in her mind. It could make one break down, but Mo Mo was already used to it. Her state of mind was as calm as an ancient well.</p><p>“Do you still want to live? Dare you press it again? !”</p><p>“Feng Yujin, please cooperate.”</p><p>“If you have the guts, try again!”</p><p>“Feng Yujin, please cooperate.”</p><p>“Ahhhh!!!”</p><p>With a “bang” sound, the gray sealing aura exploded from Mo Mo’s body.</p><p>In the next second, Feng Yujin took over control of the body, raised the sound recording bead in his hand, and was about to use force.</p><p>“If you have the guts, try crushing it!” Mo Mo’s calm voice suddenly appeared in his mind.</p><p>Feng Yujin was instantly rooted to the spot.</p><p>Even though this voice didn’t sound very different from before, there wasn’t much emotion in it.</p><p>However, Feng Yujin, who was familiar with Mo Mo’s personality, could already hear the overflowing anger that was suppressed under the calm voice.</p><p>In a split second, Feng Yujin had countless thoughts flashing through his mind.</p><p>For example, in the days to come, he would only be able to entertain himself in someone’s mind without receiving any response.</p><p>For example, no matter how much he tried to save back, he would not be able to make up for the consequences of crushing the sound recording bead. Even becoming a flatterer who only knew how to curry favor was no exception.</p><p>However…</p><p>“Would I be afraid of these things?”</p><p>Feng Yujin sneered and had this second thought at the same time.</p><p>However, he made up his mind in an instant.</p><p>Sealing aura returned to her body. Feng Yujin returned to her mind and returned control of her body. He sneered and said, “It’s just a sound recording bead. I can pinch or keep it if I want to. Today… I’ll give you face.”</p><p>Mo Mo solemnly took back the sound recording bead, lowered her head, and gently wiped the wounds on it. She said calmly, “You broke the three-point agreement again. You came out without my consent.”</p><p>“Uh!” Feng Yujin was silent for a moment.</p><p>Very soon, a tsundere voice that was trying to curry favor appeared in her mind:</p><p>“It can’t be that serious, right? You used the sound recording bead to play with me this time. What I hate the most is the voice of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon. It’s understandable that I want to crush it.</p><p>“I promise that I won’t touch the sound recording bead in the future to make up for the price of appearing this time. You see, no outsiders saw your abnormality, right?</p><p>“This matter is over!”</p><p>Feng Yujin said it absolutely like an overbearing sect master. He waved his hand and made the decision.</p><p>“…” Mo Mo was silent.</p><p>“Say something!” Feng Yujin suddenly shouted.</p><p>“…” There was still silence.</p><p>“It’s just a broken bead. Are you crazy? Why aren’t you saying anything? Do you think it’s interesting to let a person ramble on in your mind without responding?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Mo Mo, listen carefully. If I have a second choice, I will kill you directly and jump onto another person. When that happens, you will die without a complete corpse and be dismembered into thousands of pieces! Even your ashes, I will throw them to the Lian River in your village!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Ha, it’s really funny. Do I still need to flatter you? Forget it if you don’t want to say anything!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Mo Mo remained silent. She treasured the voice drop that had a few cracks on it. She quickened her pace and walked in the direction of Lone Cliff.</p><p>“There’s someone there!” Her mind was filled with shock.</p><p>Mo Mo did not stop.</p><p>“There’s really someone there. To your left, next to that big black rock, there are two higher void, stowaways! If I lie to you, I will die in a horrible way!” Feng Yujin was a little annoyed by his oath just now.</p><p>Mo Mo finally stopped, held the bronze cauldron, and turned her head to look.</p><p>In fact, she had long seen that there were two people staring at her, but because Feng Yujin reminded her, she didn’t want to turn back.</p><p>But now, she had to turn back.</p><p>Because those two people suddenly emitted some… hostility?</p><p>“People from the First Pavilion in the Sky?”</p><p>The two uninvited guests, the orange-masked man in the lead, were the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. He held the portrait in his hand and looked at it from afar, and spoke to confirm.</p><p>It’s for me… Mo Mo remained calm. She nodded and said, “I am. Seniors, what can I do for you?”</p><p>“Hahaha, seniors? What a big joke! Mo Mo, didn’t I use my recovered power to enlighten you? With your current strength, once you open your domain and let me out, no one below the demi-saint realm can defeat you. You don’t have to respect them. Just treat them as equals,” Feng Yujin said angrily in his mind.</p><p>Mo Mo turned a deaf ear to his words.</p><p>On the opposite, Five Decays of Heaven and Man exchanged a glance with Fengtang Meng Po. The latter immediately turned her head away, but there was still surprise in the former’s eyes.</p><p>“Isn’t this a little too much of a coincidence?”</p><p>“The person you’re looking for just appeared on the Road?”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man quickly walked up to her and asked curiously, “You’re from the First Pavilion in the Sky. Do You Know Mu Zixi?”</p><p>“Mo Mo, there’s something strange about this person. Don’t stare at him. Do you see your power of fate? It’s contaminated… Oh, you can’t see it. Forget it. This person’s constitution is a little special… leave, just leave, don’t care about him!” Feng Yujin suddenly became more talkative. He said this in his mind with some surprise.</p><p>Mo Mo ignored him and nodded in response to this unknown stowaway in front of her. “I know her. She’s my friend.”</p><p>“Ahhhh! I ask you to leave!”</p><p>Feng Yujin was driven mad from being ignored, but he also felt a strange sense of disgust.</p><p>He was afraid that he would get into big trouble before his power fully recovered, so he roared crazily in his mind:</p><p>“Your power of fate is abnormal now, and something has happened to your body. This precious body can’t be in trouble…”</p><p>“Did you see that? You’re sweating! Your dress, your beloved dress is dirty…”</p><p>“Wait, dirty? Misfortune?”</p><p>Feng Yujin seemed to have thought of something as he shouted:</p><p>“Mo Mo, leave!”</p><p>“This is the body of decay. Just like your body of seal, it’s rare in the world. It’s one of the five ultimate bodies.”</p><p>“But he’s even worse. He can bring five decays to the people around him. Leave quickly and don’t talk to him… How did he survive until now?”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man didn’t even know that there was a will that was shouting at the scene. Upon receiving mo Mo Mo’s affirmative response, his eyes lit up under the mask.</p><p>“Meng Po.” He turned his head.</p><p>Without waiting for instructions, Fengtang Meng Po understood and took out a talisman paper.</p><p>“Space-Time Alternate World!”</p><p>The talisman paper sliced through the air, shattering and becoming intangible. Then, the surrounding space was pulled out and entered another world.</p><p>The power of the Cloud Realm World in the Yunlun Mountain Range had also disappeared from the three of them at this moment.</p><p>“The power of time and space, this talisman paper still has the power of time and space!”</p><p>Feng Yujin was shocked.</p><p>This person they suddenly encountered had the power of time and space, and it was coming for Mo Mo…</p><p>If Mo Mo was dead, how could he find another person to host?</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>Feng Yujin immediately shouted, “Speak to me! The power of time and space is not invincible. I will now teach you three methods to crack this ‘Space-Time Alternate World’. Listen carefully, the first method is…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
