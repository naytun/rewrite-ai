Who is the Black Hand behind everything… and so on and so forth. Everything is so chaotic!”</p><p>If she wasn’t capable enough, why did she have to show off and take on the role of commander?</p><p>The situation here wasn’t something that an ordinary person could grasp. It had to be an extraordinary person…</p><p>“If you ask me what to do next, who will I ask?”</p><p>“I don’t even know why the Void Gate is here.”</p><p>“I don’t even know if the place behind the Void Gate is Sky City or some other forbidden ground. After so many trials, I still don’t know.”</p><p>“How can I answer you?”</p><p>The corners of Rao Yaoyao’s lips twitched, but she couldn’t say anything.</p><p>“Sword Deity Rao?”</p><p>Teng Shanhai looked at Rao Yaoyao’s blank expression and was speechless.</p><p>He couldn’t feel the same despair. After all, his brain wasn’t as smart as Rao Yaoyao’s.</p><p>However, he could vaguely sense that Rao Yaoyao had too many things</p><p>on her mind. But now, all these interlinking problems had yet to be solved. Instead, it seemed like… everything was about to collapse?</p><p>Buzz…</p><p>The Void Gate continued to vibrate. This time, it was not just a crack in the door that appeared. Instead, there were signs that there were two doors opening.</p><p>Dazzling light swirled about as a suction force appeared.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“What the hell Is this thing? Why is it sucking me in?”</p><p>Screams continued to ring out. There were already many Higher Void levels that were trapped in the Water Ball and were relentlessly sucked in by the Void Door.</p><p>The rest of the people used their own abilities to resist the suction force.</p><p>“What did you say just now?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s Demi-Saint Incarnation resisted the suction force of the Void Gate and looked at Teng Shanhai in disbelief.</p><p>Teng Shanhai glanced at Rao Yaoyao. Seeing that she had no desire to speak up, he answered, “This Void Gate, wasn’t that the reason why you came?”</p><p>“Came for this?”</p><p>“The Saint came for the Void Gate, what a joke!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi started to panic. Outsiders might not know, but he knew very well.</p><p>The Void Gate was connected to Sky City. Sky City was also known as Abyss Island. On the surface of the Abyss Island were the Foundational Roots of Saint Ascension, but in reality, it was the place for the exiled Demi-saints and the Holy Emperor.</p><p>“This thing, I can’t even avoid it. Why would I be drawn to it?”</p><p>“Drawn to the fortune of the Demi-Saint?”</p><p>“I was a Saint to begin with!”</p><p>“I’ve been played…”</p><p>At that moment, Jiang Buyi thought about it and could only come up with the answer that he had been tricked by Night Cat, Water Ghost and Yama, Huang Quan.</p><p>These two guys forced him into the water and quickly caught Situ Yongren. They then shifted the blame on him in front of Rao Yaoyao and without even waiting for him to explain everything to the Practitioner of the Rao clan, they opened the Void Gate…</p><p>“If this wasn’t a deadly move aimed at him, then what was?”</p><p>“These two damned tricksters!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi wanted to protest.</p><p>He had been severely wronged!</p><p>He was clearly not guilty of such a big crime, but he had become a pure innocent victim!</p><p>How could he not proclaim his innocence?</p><p>However, the Spell Forbidden Barrier had restricted his ability. Like Rao Yaoyao and the others, he could not help being absorbed into the past.</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao, you are from the Holy Emperor clan. The Holy Emperor’s Will can resist the suction force of the Void Gate!” Jiang Buyi could not help but shout before he was banished.</p><p>“Resist?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao raised her eyelids listlessly and glanced at Jiang Buyi.</p><p>“Why should she resist?”</p><p>She could not confirm anything at the moment, but the only thing she could be sure of was that Jiang Buyi was scheming for the position of Holy Emperor. Thus, he was the enemy of the Rao clan!</p><p>Since she couldn’t figure out how complicated it was, she would return everything to its original state…</p><p>If Jiang Buyi was the enemy, what he wanted the most, she couldn’t help him with.</p><p>Wasn’t this a very simple logic?</p><p>“You… are… dreaming!”</p><p>Before being sucked into the Void Gate, the corners of Rao Yaoyao’s lips curled into a sneer as she mocked loudly.</p><p>“I’m tired!”</p><p>“Destroy!”</p><p>“I’ve ruined everything!”</p><p>“Everyone, let’s enter the Void Gate together. No matter what’s behind it… my surname is Rao. I won’t die, so feel free…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
