Immediately, it gathered another part of its power and attacked.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>Huang Quan held the Shang Xuan Sword on his back.</p><p>He waited until the arrival of the Thunder Calamity’s attack before raising his sword, splitting the lightning into two.</p><p>“BZZZ BZZZ…”</p><p>The electric snake on his body swam away, but Huang Quan didn’t show any abnormality.</p><p>The invasion of calamity power didn’t do anything to his body.</p><p>Shang Xuan Sword, one of the nine supreme divine weapons, was best known for its ability to ignore all defenses. It cut through the lightning like cutting vegetables.</p><p>With one slash, it could split mountains and seas.</p><p>Its title as the world’s sharpest sword was not undeserved.</p><p>Other than the famed sword, Heavenly Unravel, there was probably no other weapon in the world that could withstand the attack of the Shang Xuan Sword.</p><p>“Deva…why is he here?”</p><p>Huang Quan put the Shang Xuan Sword back on his back. With a slight doubt in his heart, he quickly flew toward the center of the tribulation.</p><p>The deep sea could not form a water ball around him, and the water pressure could not crush his body. This showed Huang Quan’s ability.</p><p>Even in the Spell Forbidden Barrier, his time and space attributes were sealed.</p><p>However, his time and space-sacred physique could still make him feel like he was in another plane, and he could not be attacked by anything.</p><p>In terms of combat, he had the Shang Xuan Sword and Hun Che on his back. One for physical attack, and the other for spiritual attack.</p><p>This was why Huang Quan dared to go into the sea that even had the saint’s will alone.</p><p>“Meng Po has been found.”</p><p>“The Deva has obviously fallen into the deep sea for some time, seeing that he has fallen to such a deep position…”</p><p>“What happened to him?”</p><p>Up until now, Huang Quan only knew that Meng Po had gone into the sea because she had met the demi-saint of the Jiang clan on the Lone Cliff.</p><p>The five decays of Heaven and Man had acted together with Meng Po, but they had been separated and fell into the deep sea ahead of time.</p><p>This matter still needed to be considered.</p><p>If it weren’t for the soup causing Meng Po to still be unconscious under the seal…</p><p>If it weren’t for the critical situation at the moment and that they had to find someone as soon as possible…</p><p>Huang Quan couldn’t wait to wake Meng Po up and let her tell him everything that had happened before.</p><p>Of course, it would be a waste of time.</p><p>Huang Quan wasn’t sure if there would be a water ball protecting Meng Po after he took her out of the second dimension.</p><p>If there wasn’t, then Meng Po would be attacked by the water pressure and she would die!</p><p>Therefore, the most important thing now was to find her.</p><p>As long as he found the five decays of Heaven and Man, he would have all the answers!</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>He flew at lightning speed.</p><p>Since he couldn’t use his spatial power, he naturally couldn’t teleport under the deep sea.</p><p>However, the sacred physique of time and space abandoned the restriction of water pressure, and Huang Quan’s speed was already at the highest level of a higher void.</p><p>Not long after he had destroyed the lightning with one strike, he finally arrived at the center of the tribulation.</p><p>At the same time, the thunder calamity above the nine heavens showed signs of dissipating, and no more lightning fell.</p><p>“It’s over?”</p><p>Huang Quan raised his eyes.</p><p>The fading of the calamity power in the deep sea meant that there were two possibilities.</p><p>Either the person transcending the calamity died.</p><p>Or the person transcending the calamity succeeded, and the nine Death Thunder Calamity faded on its own, adding another higher void to the world.</p><p>He scanned his surroundings.</p><p>Soon, Huang Quan found a floating figure not far away.</p><p>The person wore an orange robe, tattered and tattered. The mask on his face had been shattered, revealing a bloody face of the five decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>There was no water ball.</p><p>However, the water pressure could not crush his body.</p><p>This was because the five decays of Heaven and Man was not weakened to his limit, and hence did not trigger the protective mechanism of the water ball.</p><p>“Hu…”</p><p>Huang Quan heaved a sigh of relief when he saw this.</p><p>It was good that the person was not dead.</p><p>He walked quickly to the side of the five decays of Heaven and Man. After thinking for a moment, he took out the Shang Xuan sword on his back and shook it slightly from a distance.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>Sword cries sounded, and the water rippled.</p><p>Under the effect of the external force, the eyelids of Deva, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, quivered and showed signs of awakening.</p><p>In the next second.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
