Even with the scabbard thrust upside down at the base, it still towered into the clouds.</p><p>In the Eastern Mountain, the Sword Will was rampant.</p><p>The melody was rhythmic, as if someone was singing a opera, and they were in high spirits.</p><p>It was not until the Golden Light Scroll in the Nine Heavens was withdrawn, then the domineering and decadent Taoist music finally disappeared, and the opera-like singing in the Eastern Mountain also stopped.</p><p>“A hundred generations in exchange for Bazhun’an…</p><p>“Tsk tsk, after having suppressed myself for so long, I’ve finally found some of the unrestrained feeling from decades ago…</p><p>“I really miss it.”</p><p>Wen Ting, dressed in a costume, walked barefooted among the dusky mountain, his tone full of nostalgia.</p><p>Not long after, a low sobbing sound from the Sword Washing Pool in the distance attracted his attention. Wen Ting listened carefully for a while, then the corners of his mouth curled in a sneer and he quickly walked over.</p><p>“Splash.”</p><p>He stomped his foot into the Sword Washing Pool and water splashed in all directions.</p><p>He found the source of the sobbing sound. It came from a broken sword.</p><p>Logically speaking, all the swords in the Burial Sword Tomb were swords that had no owners. The owner had either died or lost contact with them. It was rare for a broken sword to be abandoned and still have such a strong vitality.</p><p>However, the broken sword in front of him was crying bitterly and there were still water droplets on its Sword Body.</p><p>It was unclear whether it was the water from the Sword Washing Pool that splashed on to it, or whether it was really the tears from the iron sword, which had rarely been seen in a thousand years.</p><p>Wen Ting squatted down with a smile and looked at the broken sword in front of him, which was trembling with grievance. He stretched out his hand and flicked it lightly.</p><p>“Buzz, Buzz, Buzz!”</p><p>The broken sword struggled violently, unable to bear the humiliation.</p><p>Wen Ting smiled mockingly:</p><p>“Qingju, ah, Qingju Sword, why are you so stubborn?”</p><p>“I told you to find another owner, but you didn’t listen. Now, he’s back, but you’ve been abandoned. You’d better stay with me in this dark Eastern Mountain for the rest of your life…”</p><p>“Hahaha, that’s so funny!”</p><p>“Sob, Sob, sob!”</p><p>The broken sword cried even harder.</p><p>It really wanted to pull itself out and fly up and slash the human in front of it.</p><p>However, if the sword in the Sword Washing Pool had no owner, it would never be able to come out, and it would definitely not be able to see the light of day again.</p><p>“Tsk Tsk Tsk…”</p><p>Wen Ting clicked his tongue and grinned evilly.</p><p>Seeing that the broken sword was crying even harder, he took out a jade bottle and collected the water droplets from the broken sword’s body, one drop at a time.</p><p>“Go on, continue crying, cry more…”</p><p>“Tears of a sword, this is a rare sight in a thousand years! There’s not much to collect, you’d better cry harder.”</p><p>“Keng Keng Keng Keng…”</p><p>The broken sword couldn’t bear the humiliation and a sharp burst of strong Sword Will erupted from its body. Some of the rusty ancient swords in the Sword Washing Pool couldn’t withstand the pressure and shattered, one after another.</p><p>“Can this hurt me?”</p><p>Wen Ting was indifferent. He let the Sword Will continue to wreak havoc, which was like a breeze blowing on his face and merely stirred up the ends of his hair and clothes.</p><p>He stretched out his hand and gave the broken sword a hard blow.</p><p>Instantly, Qingju Sword cried out in pain again.</p><p>Wen Ting laughed out loud as he picked up the jade bottle while continuing to mock.</p><p>“Go ahead and cry!”</p><p>“Let’s see how long you and I will stay here… You don’t take me as your master? Soon, you’ll only have the word ‘cry’ left in your life!”</p><p>“You’re still waiting for Bazhun’an?”</p><p>“Why don’t you go to Heaven!”</p><p>..</p><p>In an ordinary blacksmith’s shop in the Central Region.</p><p>Under the iron-cast plaque which read ‘Cao’s Blacksmith’s Shop’, a half-naked man who had ‘unicorn arms’ was pacing around anxiously, but he didn’t dare to make any noise.</p><p>However, it was clear that he had been waiting for a long time. Finally, he couldn’t help but shout at the blacksmith’s shop.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
