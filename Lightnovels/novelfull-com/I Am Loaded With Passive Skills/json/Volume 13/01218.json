He could either fight with them or seal them off.</p><p>Mo Mo glanced back at the coffin on her shoulder. She thought for a moment, put it down, and sat on it.</p><p>She looked into the distance.</p><p>The mountains were silent and the wind was strong. There was no one around.</p><p>“What am I resisting?”</p><p>After waiting for a long time, Mo Mo finally snapped out of her daze and subconsciously thought about it.</p><p>Feng Yujin had a good attitude and she approved of it.</p><p>“What was there to hate about the Ghost Beast Host Body?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could calmly accept himself as the Ghost Beast Host Body and became friends with him.</p><p>However, she was subconsciously resisting the identity of the Ghost Beast Host Body.</p><p>Fate could not be chosen.</p><p>Since it was destined to be a symbiotic state, what was she resisting?</p><p>The wind was blowing again.</p><p>Mo Mo thought for a long time and when she finally had the answer, she smiled in relief.</p><p>Perhaps, what she was resisting was just a stereotype.</p><p>The rumors from the continent about the Ghost Beast Host Body, were the filthy kind of stereotypes.</p><p>However, Feng Yujin…</p><p>“He’s also a living person.”</p><p>Mo Mo sat on the coffin and smiled. The setting sun of the Yunlun mountain range shone on her serene face and the wind rustled her clothes.</p><p>Everything in this world was beautiful in her eyes.</p><p>“Sha…”</p><p>At some point in time, the space moved, and a figure landed on the spot, breaking the silence.</p><p>“Sorry to disturb you. I’m here to collect something.”</p><p>Mo Mo stood up and looked to the side. It was a man with a Golden Beast Mask and a trident in his hand. His image was clearly outlined. He was the one who rode the waves in Yunlun and was the Demi-Saint who had confronted Ai Cangsheng.</p><p>“Hello.”</p><p>Mo Mo nodded slightly. She realized that this should be the person that Feng Yujin had asked her to wait for.</p><p>Even if he was in a deep sleep.</p><p>But before that, all he could do was to make all the arrangements and wait for his awakening again.</p><p>It turned out that this Water-type also knew Feng Yujin…</p><p>Mo Mo’s thoughts ran wild. If it had been before, she wouldn’t have hesitated and would have directly sent out the Godhood Sealing Coffin.</p><p>But now, she wanted to know more about Feng Yujin, so she asked, “You are?”</p><p>“The Fifth Saint Servant, Water Ghost.”</p><p>Water Ghost smiled and said, “Senior Feng Yujin used his Holy Power, so he would erase all traces before he fell asleep. I don’t know what happened exactly, but he asked me to come and get something, so I guessed that he must have done it.”</p><p>“Saint Servant…” Mo Mo thought for a while, then turned and pointed at the Godhood-Sealing Coffin. “Take it.”</p><p>“What’s inside?” Water Ghost was also curious.</p><p>Mo Mo suddenly jerked in shock. The Godhood-Sealing Coffin indeed required Sealing Power in order to be opened.</p><p>It had been quite a long while already. She immediately injected Sealing Power into the coffin and the coffin board opened with a bang.</p><p>Water Ghost stepped forward and waved his hand to push the coffin board away. When he saw the two immobile masked people inside, his pupils constricted.</p><p>“Yama?”</p><p>“It should be.” Mo Mo nodded.</p><p>Water Ghost’s mind went blank.</p><p>“Granny Feng Meng Po and I were just in contact with each other not long ago, and now she is in the hands of someone else?”</p><p>She wasn’t weak either…</p><p>“Oh, then Holy Emperor Fengtian should be fine.”</p><p>“This is?” Water Ghost looked at the orange-masked man. He didn’t recognize this person.</p><p>“He has mastered the power of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. He should be a decaying body. Feng Yujin… Senior, in order to seal him, fell into a deep sleep,” Mo Mo said.</p><p>“… The Five Decays of Heaven and Man. I heard that Yama has mastered this. It’s actually true.” Water Ghost pondered for a while. This means the Seal Attribute can be defeated. If he was summoned, he might not be able to handle it.</p><p>“It’s the Plague!”</p><p>“How do you want to deal with him?” Water Ghost raised his eyes and asked.</p><p>Mo Mo looked at the two people lying in the coffin, who were unable to move.</p><p>Before this, she didn’t even know these two people.</p><p>“Do whatever you want.” She put them down.</p><p>Water Ghost’s eyebrows shot up in surprise. He thought this woman was going to take revenge, but he didn’t expect her to have no inclination whatsoever. He immediately nodded and said, “Then I’ll take them away?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Goodbye.” Water Ghost picked up the coffin and said goodbye.</p><p>“Wait…” Mo Mo seemed to recall something and asked, “Xu Xiaoshou, where is he now?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Water Ghost stopped in his tracks. There was a silver-haired woman reflected in one of his eyes and in the other eye, there was a reflection of the woman in front of him. Then, both his eyes lit up.</p><p>He really wanted to ask more questions.</p><p>However, the message from Feng Yujin flashed through his mind. He did not dare to say anything more and turned his head away.</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
