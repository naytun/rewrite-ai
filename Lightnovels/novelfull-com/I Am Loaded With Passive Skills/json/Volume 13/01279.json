It means that the void gate has been opened… many people came in at once?”</p><p>Gu Qingyi held the void token in his hand and suddenly realized that running to the edge wasn’t a good idea.</p><p>Although he didn’t know how many people would come from Deep Sea World, there was no way back.</p><p>Abyss Island should be lively now.</p><p>“It’s definitely too late for me to send out the information now. Also, I don’t know if I can find Sword Deity Rao after getting out of here.</p><p>“I am late anyway. Since everyone is here, I might as well fight for the opportunity…”</p><p>The void token in his hand suddenly became a bit hot.</p><p>Gu Qingyi took the void token from Yu Lingdi but didn’t plan to help him, which made him feel strange. After all, he was not a person tend to go back on his words.</p><p>However..</p><p>When he thought about the fact that the closest place to Deep Sea World was Lone Cliff, and his second junior brother was there.</p><p>If a large number of people entered Deep Sea World…</p><p>Would Gu Qinger also jump off the cliff?</p><p>“Yu Lingdi…”</p><p>“Second junior brother…”</p><p>He had two choices.</p><p>Gu Qingyi hesitated for a moment before coming to a decision.</p><p>No matter what he had received from the stranger, as the eldest senior brother of Burial Sword Tomb, he couldn’t just give up on his family to complete a sudden mission.</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>Gu Qingyi raised his eyes and bowed to Yu Lingdi, who was about to lose consciousness.</p><p>“If my second junior brother comes here, I am sure something will happen to him sooner or later.</p><p>“I am returning you this void token now. I must find him here!”</p><p>After saying this, Gu Qingyi threw the void token back despite Yu Lingdi’s response or the fact that he couldn’t answer.</p><p>He then made up his mind and followed the familiar Sword Will.</p><p>“Sow nothing, reap nothing,” he thought.</p><p>If the second junior brother was in trouble, he didn’t want the key to go home!</p><p>..</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt like he had fallen from the sky.</p><p>A second ago, he was still in Deep Sea World.

Some people even call here the land of exile, so the the place that trapped demi-saint and even Holy Emperors is… Abyss Island?”</p><p>He looked up.</p><p>In front of him was a huge rock, and in the distance was the ancient city’s street that was gradually climbing higher.</p><p>At this moment, his vision, five senses, and even six senses were blocked by the strange magnetic field of Abyss Island, so he could not see very far.</p><p>However, his perception still worked perfectly.</p><p>Looking in from the perception perspective, he found the deeper he went, the bigger the buildings became.</p><p>Abyss Island was simply a kingdom of giants!</p><p>It seemed those building this country were all Berserk Giants!</p><p>“This is Abyss Island?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not afraid of the giants, but he was anxious and uneasy because of the legends of Abyss Island that he had learned in the past.</p><p>However, the proverb was right.</p><p>He should take things as they came.</p><p>If Water Ghost did not lie to him, Abyss Island was a land of death and opportunities!</p><p>However..,</p><p>“Where is he?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned his head and looked at his right hand.</p><p>He was in Deep Sea World with Situ Yongren. How did he disappear after the teleportation?</p><p>“Random teleportation?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fell into deep thought.</p><p>He wondered if he lost his perfect hostage, Situ Yongren, who could be his scapegoat if Rao Yaoyao or demi-saint Jiang Buyi were here?</p><p>“F*ck!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
