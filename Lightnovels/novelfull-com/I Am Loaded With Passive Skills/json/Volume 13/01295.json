The face of Double Dumba*s was distorted. Both his legs turned into the Nine Chasing Clouds as he continued running frantically.</p><p>At this moment, his state of mind exploded.</p><p>What the hell was a void attendant?</p><p>Why was his attack that contained Holy Power not effective?</p><p>The giant behind him… it could swallow the Holy Power and turn it into its own energy. It then maintained a perfect state and continued to use its strong body to kick people crazily like chasing a duck.</p><p>“What exactly is its body structure like?”</p><p>Double Dumba*s couldn’t understand.</p><p>He was in such a state now. He had swallowed the Holy Miracle Fruit and even produced the Holy Power.</p><p>Now, he was already the number one person under the demi-saint. Why did he still fail to defeat the void attendant… with one strike?</p><p>But that was the reality…</p><p>Just now, after saying “Now, it’s my turn to feel good!”, Double Dumba*s had casually used the Holy Power to attack. He had thought that he could easily crush the void attendant.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after the attack, the void attendant only swayed slightly, and then…</p><p>It burped!</p><p>“It could eat up all attacks in the form of spiritual cultivation energy?</p><p>“In other words, if you want to crush this guy, you have to use physical strength or ancient swordsman?”</p><p>When he derived this conclusion, Double Dumba*s almost vomited blood.</p><p>As expected, in the following few experiments, the void attendant ate all of his attacks.</p><p>Regardless of a normal spiritual technique or a move with added Holy Power…</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>At this moment, Double Dumba*s didn’t dare to think anymore if he felt good or not.</p><p>At this juncture, he only wanted to survive. He only wanted to escape from the pursuit of the void giant, because all of his attacks were just like the flimsy paper in front of the void attendant!</p><p>“As long as I can escape, I just need a few months.</p><p>“With the power of the Holy Miracle Fruit, I can quickly evolve into a demi-saint. By then, I should be able to fight this big fellow.</p><p>“But now…”</p><p>The face of Double Dumba*s was covered in blood as he was running away desperately. On his way, he couldn’t help but look back, only to see the sky turn dark again.</p><p>“But now, I can’t escape at all…”</p><p>With a bang, another stomp of feet, Double Dumba*s was crushed into pieces again.</p><p>“I’m split open…”</p><p>Double Dumba*s was stunned and in complete despair.</p><p>He had thought that entering the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer and obtaining the Holy Miracle Fruit would be the beginning of his rise. He had never expected it to be a sign of the road open to self-destruction.</p><p>The void attendant wasn’t something that humans could fight against.</p><p>He still wanted to struggle…</p><p>But the spiritual source in the energy reserve had bottomed out. Double Dumba*s couldn’t dissolve again.</p><p>He knew that as long as the void attendant stomped on him once again, he would turn into minced meat…</p><p>“Heavens want me to die!</p><p>“But I’m not willing!”</p><p>Double Dumba*s roared at the top of his lungs.</p><p>He wasn’t willing to die in this place in such a muddle-headed manner. Clearly, the opportunity of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer opportunity was at a fixed location. As long as he was given time to find his way back, he would be able to prosper in an instant…</p><p>This feeling of falling from heaven to hell was very uncomfortable!</p><p>At this moment, just as Double Dumba*s was in despair, the clown-like void attendant behind him suddenly stopped stomping his stout right foot that it had lifted.</p><p>“Intruder…”</p><p>The void attendant stared at the ant beneath his feet and muttered. After a long while, he retracted his foot and looked into the distance.</p><p>“What’s going on? You’re not going to kill me anymore?”</p><p>Double Dumba*s didn’t understand what was going on, but he was ecstatic as he watched. He immediately took out elixirs and swallowed them.</p><p>His high-grade pills had long been used up in the world of the deep sea, but there were still some low-grade pills left. If he used them now, it would undoubtedly save his life.</p><p>Taking advantage of the recovery of some of the spiritual sources in his energy reserve, Double Dumba*s used the Nine Clouds Chasing spiritual technique again and began to run frantically.</p><p>He didn’t even turn his head.</p><p>He expected the void attendant not to kill him. It would be pointless to ask. He might as well take advantage of this time and rush a bit further.</p><p>Perhaps he could survive!</p><p>“As long as I can live, as long as I can live…”</p><p>Double Dumba*s ran hard with all his might. Where there was life, there was hope.</p><p>If he could survive, when the wisp of the Holy Power in his energy reserve grew stronger, he would have the Demi-saint Physique.</p><p>He would definitely empty the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer!</p><p>But after running a few steps, Double Dumba*s stopped again.</p><p>“Bang! Bang! Bang…”</p><p>Right in front of the escape route, he could hear the sound of a giant running!</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>Double Dumba*s was stunned.</p><p>Another void attendant?</p><p>Hearing the rapid running sound, could it be that there were many of them, and…</p><p>Void attendants, the high speed type?</p><p>The void attendant that had been chasing him all this time was, at the very least, a carefree master. Basically, he was taking it one step at a time.</p><p>But the voice in front…</p><p>Was running frantically?</p><p>“What’s wrong with you? I only picked a Holy Miracle Fruit. Is there a need to send so many void attendants chasing after me?” Double Dumba*s fell from heaven into hell again.</p><p>He was surrounded, and there was nowhere to run.</p><p>He gave up completely. If he had to die, so be it. As expected of Sky City. There were foundational roots of Saint Ascension. But if one wanted to take it, one had to exchange his life for it.</p><p>After he calmed down, he could hear even more sounds with his higher void (level) hearing ability.</p><p>The void attendant behind him no longer moved. However, there was a subtle yet abrupt sound mixed in with the sound in front of him.</p><p>“Honk! Honk! Honk! Honk! Honk…”</p><p>Double Dumba*s was stunned.</p><p>What the hell was that?</p><p>A void attendant that brought along a goose?</p><p>…</p><p>“It’s coming from this direction!</p><p>“The sound came from here. It’s not much different from Flame Python’s guidance. It could be the same opportunity…</p><p>“Fierce duck, fire beast!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
