He saw that there was a hidden power which was of the same origin as the ancient words of the imperial edict. It was like the Ashvatta Divine Tree Seed he had eaten back then.</p><p>Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, Land of Screen and Candles.</p><p>Hua Changdeng, who was lying under the God Worship Willow Tree suddenly had a look of surprise and pity in his eyes. The candle flame on the table in front of him suddenly lit up.</p><p>Swoosh.</p><p>The Ghost Hunter flew into his hand. Hua Changdeng looked up at the sky, where the Sword Will of the Land of Screen and Candles was wreaking havoc.</p><p>Seeing that it was the Power of the Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict in the sky and not his old friend, he shook his head with a smile and sighed. His sigh was filled with emotion and then he lay down again.</p><p>What he saw was the power of Sword Cognition.</p><p>Under the Four Seas.</p><p>A woman with all four limbs bound and dressed in prison garb, whose mortal appearance failed to hide her beauty, looked up from the water prison. In her eyes, there was also the light of the Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict.</p><p>Unlike everyone else, what she saw was not power, nor light.</p><p>It was a man with a full beard, an unkempt appearance, and whose eyes were a turbid yellow.</p><p>Two streams of tears flowed into the water prison.</p><p>The woman’s eyelashes fluttered and she silently closed her eyes. It was as if she was thinking of the beautiful past. An indescribable smile lurked at the corners of her pale lips.</p><p>…</p><p>All the living things in the world raised their heads at this moment. They were shocked to see the figure under the light.</p><p>The Jiang clan’s Demi-Saint, Huang Quan, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, Rao Yaoyao, Xu Xiaoshou, Mu Ling, and the others who were standing in front of the Void Gate were all facing each other under the Deep Sea at the Lone Cliff.</p><p>They were no exception!</p><p>The Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict interrupted the progress of the world, making everyone in the world free up space to listen to the words of Guidance.</p><p>“A hundred generations in exchange for Bazhu’nan, I summon the Divine Light by my command…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was still thinking about these words and thought that he would still need a few months practice to be able to reach the level of being the center of attention and pulling the wool over everyone’s eyes in the world.</p><p>In the Nine Heavens, Bazhun’an’s listless state was swept away, and a sharp glint that had not been seen for decades appeared in his eyes.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>The last two lines of the Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict suddenly lit up, with the Taoist music echoing in everyone’s ears. It dawned on everyone that this sound… was not a sacred voice , but came from a human!</p><p>“A hundred generations in exchange for Bazhun’an, I summon the Divine Light by my command.”</p><p>With a buzz, a stream of golden light erupted forth.</p><p>The power of the Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict was completely activated by the ancient blood characters. It turned into a nine-colored Divine Light that descended from the sky and landed on… The Lone Cliff!</p><p>Bazhun’an gazed into the Void. The turbid yellow was no longer there. His gaze shifted and fell on the Lone Cliff where the Divine Light had landed.</p><p>He took a deep breath, waved his sleeve in that direction, and said softly,</p><p>“Abyss Island, let’s land.”</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>As soon as his voice stopped, the chains of the Way of the Heavens could no longer restrain Sky City. They exploded with a massive bang.</p><p>Meanwhile, Abyss Island that had been floating above Dongtianwang City for almost a month, as well as the ancient city located on Abyss Island…</p><p>Finally, like the fallen Buzhou Mountain, it tilted and fell toward the direction of the Lone Cliff in the Yunlun Mountain Range.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>The sun and moon were terrified, and the people of the world paled!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
