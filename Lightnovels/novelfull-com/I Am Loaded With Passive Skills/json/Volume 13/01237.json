It was because he would backfire on someone when he knew that one had made a wrong move.</p><p>However, he could not kill Situ Yongren yet. “Dao Qiongcang” was the protective talisman of Situ Yongren. No demi-saint dared to touch him too.</p><p>Since none of the demi-saint dared to touch this person, Xu Xiaoshou found that this person was useful though.</p><p>“One thing,” he became serious all of a sudden. Then, he asked, “Do you know the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan?”</p><p>“Yes,” said Situ Yongren as he nodded. He did not understand why the change of topic all of a sudden. But, he said sincerely, “Do you mean the Jiang Clan of the Pu Xuan in the Northern Region? I met them once during the celebration of the demi-saint clan.”</p><p>Indeed, he had met with quite a number of saints… Xu Xiaoshou then gave it a thought. Fortunately, he was careful enough not to use the Soul Reading on him just now. He might not be able to read anything from him at all.</p><p>“Have you heard about the tragedy of the Lei family?” Xu Xiaoshou asked again.</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>This time, Situ Yongren did not respond to him directly. On the contrary, he lifted his head and looked at Xu Xiaoshou in shock.</p><p>Just now, he mentioned information. But later, he asked about “the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan”. Now, he asked about the tragedy of the Lei family.</p><p>Situ Yongren felt that things seemed to be more tricky now.</p><p>Would Lord Huang Quan reveal some terrifying information to him?</p><p>“You can choose not to believe what I say. But, I will say it anyway,” said Xu Xiaoshou calmly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand casually and said frankly.</p><p>“The demi-saint of the Jiang Clan has involved themselves in the investigation of the Lei Family’s tragedy. They intended to overturn the case. They even set their eyes on the Lei Family’s Eyes.”</p><p>He continued, “I bet that you know Yama is collecting the Lei Family’s Eyes. But, we are a dark fraction. So, we are not afraid of letting the Holy Divine Palace know about it.”</p><p>“However, the demi-saint of Jiang Clan has crossed the line. They tried to take over the authority of the Lei Family and the Lei Family’s Eyes. I don’t think you know about this yet, do you?”</p><p>Situ Yongren widened his eyes upon hearing it.</p><p>The authority of the Lei Family?</p><p>The Lei Family’s Eyes?</p><p>Overturning the case?</p><p>Was this something that Situ Yongren could come into contact with at this stage?</p><p>Situ Yongren’s first reaction was that he was lying to me. His second thought was not necessary for him to know. As for his third reaction, he believed in what Lord Huang Quan said.</p><p>The demi-saint of the Jiang Clan was involved?</p><p>For what?</p><p>The Lei Family’s Eyes? Was that all?</p><p>No!</p><p>It did not seem to be the case!</p><p>Demi-saint had always been content to retain sovereignty over a part of the country. They sought to protect themselves. However, if they made a move, it would mean they were up to something big.</p><p>Furthermore, only the Holy Emperor was above the demi-saints.</p><p>Could it be that the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan intended to ascend the throne of the Holy Emperor?</p><p>Did they intend to kill the Holy Emperor?</p><p>What a joke!</p><p>Situ Yongren’s heart was stirred. Upon hearing the words from Lord Huang Quan, he felt that the war of the world was about to begin.</p><p>“Are you serious, Elder?” Situ Yongren finally spoke. But, he could not hide the shock he was suffering now.</p><p>“I never lie. The demi-saint of the Jiang Clan will be arriving soon to verify what I have said,” Xu Xiaoshou’s tone was indifferent. He then smiled as he spoke.</p><p>“This piece of information is both a credit and a death sentence.”</p><p>He continued, “Since you know it now, it means that you are involved as well. I don’t think I need to say anything further, do I?”</p><p>“I only hope that you can survive to pass the information to your supreme master. The demi-saint of the Jiang Clan is eyeing the Lei Family’s Eyes too. This indeed interfered with Yama’s interests.”</p><p>Situ Yongren’s heart was pumping fast. He seemed to understand everything in an instant.</p><p>Both the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan and Yama were having the same goal, which was the Lei Family’s Eyes.</p><p>So this time, Yama was targeted by the demi-saint. Hence, Lord Huang Quan had no choice but to seek the official’s cooperation.</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>Who was not afraid of the demi-saint?</p><p>Lord Huang Quan had never entered the saint realm. Thus, it was absolutely normal for him to be afraid of the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan.</p><p>Was this the reason Lord Huang Quan spared his life?</p><p>Also…</p><p>“This would be a great merit!”</p><p>Situ Yongren knew that the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan had crossed the line and acted without seeking permission from the Holy Divine Palace. As long as he reported it to the Holy Divine Palace, he would definitely gain great merit as it concerned the demi-saint.</p><p>Perhaps, he would be able to ascend to the throne of Path Division Chief!</p><p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p><p>Situ Yongren’s heart was pumping faster as he thought about it. He had a feeling that this was a blessing in disguise.</p><p>On the other hand, Xu Xiaoshou could sense his heartbeat.</p><p>He trembled as he observed carefully. He found that the source of the heartbeat was not only from Situ Yongren but also from the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale.</p><p>The Holy Emperor Dragon Scale?</p><p>His heart skipped a beat all of a sudden.</p><p>It meant that the demi-saint had arrived!</p><p>“What the hell! So soon?”</p><p>At that moment, Xu Xiaoshou confirmed that the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale had started to beat. As the heart rate increased, Xu Xiaoshou understood what was going on.</p><p>Suddenly, he had an urge to run away as soon as possible.</p><p>But, he came to think of the person next to him who needed to be fooled as well.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could only calm his mind and look above the deep sea.</p><p>He did not know what he had forgotten. But, Xu Xiaoshou emptied his mind and suppressed the nervousness that might cause him to stutter as he talked. He then put his hand behind his back and said faintly.</p><p>“He is here.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
