He slapped it on the table and spun it in front of Ai Cangsheng.</p><p>“Him.”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng’s lowered his head and looked at the bright smile on the Black Gold Bounty Order. He did not need to look at the name to say it aloud.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou? I know this person and have paid attention to him.”</p><p>“Yes, even you know him…”</p><p>“Then, the variable isn’t him?”</p><p>“I only got this one.”</p><p>“Then it can only be him!” Ai Cangsheng smiled and confirmed.</p><p>This young man was indeed so outstanding that he could be considered a “variable.”.</p><p>Based on his experience and growth rate, he could be called “Junior Bazhun’n.”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng had seen this person during the battle in Eighth Palace. As expected, this fellow was able to stir up trouble in front of Rao Yaoyao in Dongtianwang City.</p><p>Among the younger generation, very few people could be at the same level as him.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang saw Ai Cangsheng staring at the Black Gold Bounty Order on the Round Table and could tell that he knew Xu Xiaoshou pretty well.</p><p>He took a long breath, but he could not let it out.</p><p>However, he still could not say anything in the end.</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>Pushing the wheelchair to the entrance of the Great Hall, Dao Qiongcang felt a flickering light in the east, raised his eyes, and stopped.</p><p>“Like an enemy but also like a friend, a friend but also an enemy… will he bring me luck or agony…</p><p>“Does this ‘variable’ mean Xu Xiaoshou will help me one day?</p><p>“However, the ‘variable’ that can be calculated, so is he still a legit one?”</p><p>..</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>In the sky above Yunlun Mountain Range, a huge rumbling sound was getting closer and closer, and the sky was getting dimmer and dimmer.</p><p>After observing closely, people thought that the landing point of Sky City seemed to be Lone Cliff.</p><p>However, the entire Yunlun Mountain Range and the surrounding areas would be destroyed if such a giant thing fell here.</p><p>At this moment, all the Spiritual Cultivators in the land of Yunlun Mountain Range looked up and had despair in their eyes.</p><p>What would happen when such a huge sky city crashed down on them..</p><p>Would they be able to survive?</p><p>“Help!”</p><p>“Where is Sword Deity Rao? Sword Deity Rao, please lead the battle!”</p><p>“Jesus Christ, why are you immortals fighting in Yunlun Mountain Range? I just want to pass a trial in peace. If I’m guilty, please let the trial officer punish me but not Sky City.”</p><p>“Save me, save me, save me…”</p><p>Everyone in Yunlun Mountain Range was crying for help.</p><p>Sky City… Although this ancient city was known as Sky City, it clearly had no intention of staying in the sky.</p><p>If it landed, how would a higher void be able to stop it?</p><p>Even a demi-saint might not be able to do it!</p><p>Along with the explosion in the ruins of Lone Mountain, Bazhun’an, Water Ghost, and Cen Qiaofu remained calm.</p><p>There was only one person with one arm pointing to the sky, and his knees were trembling.</p><p>“Sir, sir, sir, it’s coming down…”</p><p>Xiu Yuanke’s lips turned purple. If he hadn’t known the men in front of him were real people, he would have thought they were blind. How could they turn a blind eye to this great terror?</p><p>How many lives would be buried in Yunlun Mountain Range when this city fell?</p><p>“Are you afraid?”</p><p>Bazhun’an smiled and turned his head to look at him.</p><p>“I’m not afraid!”</p><p>Xiu Yuanke was calm for a moment but turned anxious the next second. “Honestly, sir, I… I am a bit…”</p><p>“The main thing is that there are many young people here, and they are all innocent. They can’t be crushed to death like this, right?” Xiu Yuanke added.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Water Ghost and Cen Qiaofu also turned their heads and looked at him.</p><p>“What What?”</p><p>Xiu Yuanke shrunk, suddenly realized something, and said nervously, “I, I didn’t mean that you are not humans. I just… , you are human, human… uh, that’s not right… I mean, should we…”</p><p>He raised his hand slightly. “Stay… uh, that’s not what I mean… well, maybe we should be more aware?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
