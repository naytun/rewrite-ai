She was prepared, but she didn’t dare to act rashly. She only asked in a slightly shocked tone, “Why are you here?”</p><p>She remembered that there was an anti-sack ‘Eighth Sword Deity’ on the Lone Cliff.</p><p>However, she had fought that fellow during the night battle in Dongtianwang City. He was an impostor.</p><p>The person before her…</p><p>He fitted every aspect of the information that Gou Wuyue had submitted, including his appearance, cultivation level, turbid eyes, and listless temperament. Furthermore, he was able to stand so calmly amid the raging sea.</p><p>The familiar lingering whiff of Sword Cognition which pervaded his whole body from inside out could not be disguised at all.</p><p>Based on her intuition alone, Rao Yaoyao was dead sure. This was indeed Bazhun’an!</p><p>“Don’t! There’s no need to fight.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s Bazhun’an incarnation felt greatly relieved as he faced Rao Yaoyao’s Cang Godhood Sword. He smiled and said,</p><p>“Today, I’m not here to fight.</p><p>“Moreover, under the Spell Forbidden Barrier in the Deep Sea, your Spiritual Source and Attributes are gone. Even if you combine them together, they can’t hurt me.”</p><p>“Of course, we can just have a little chat. There’s no need to make a big deal out of it.”</p><p>“Have a little chat?”</p><p>“What would the Holy Divine Palace and a Saint Servant possibly chat about?”</p><p>Teng Shanhai sneered. He suddenly remembered Bazhun’an’s words and said, “What do you mean? This Void Gate…”</p><p>“It’s a trap!” Xu Xiaoshou interrupted with a smile, exposing the fear in the hearts of the people in front of him.</p><p>He had heard all this when he was in the Disappearing State, so how could he not understand what the people of the Holy Divine Palace were most afraid of.</p><p>And the trick to is to naturally say what the people were most afraid of hearing.</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>All of this had to be built on the premise of being ‘very strong’, or at least ‘pretending to appear very strong in the eyes of others’.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou ignored Teng Shanhai and Rao Yaoyao and turned to look at Mu Ling.</p><p>In order to prevent the Master’s disciple from ambushing him and causing his disguise to be revealed, he still had more tricks up his sleeve.</p><p>“Dong!”</p><p>He casually took out Elder Sang’s Three-legged Auspicious Dragon and Phoenix bathtub and Xu Xiaoshou leaned beside him and said, “Let’s be a little more cordial today! We should have met this person from the Holy Palace before…”</p><p>He looked at Mu Ling and smiled:</p><p>“Let’s not talk about the old stuff anymore. We don’t have time. Let’s talk about new things!”</p><p>“Your disciple is now in my hands. This Alchemy Cauldron is the best proof.”.</p><p>“Of course, due to our relationship, I won’t hurt her. I’ll just use her as a shield. After we’re done talking, I’ll let her go. What do you think?”</p><p>Bai Lian was stunned.</p><p>“This, this wasn’t the Hua Ying’s Alchemy Cauldron, right?”</p><p>But he suddenly remembered that this was the ‘Hua Ying Alchemy Cauldron’ that had appeared on the Lone Cliff… and he seemed to have understood something.</p><p>Mu Ling appeared stunned too. Then, his brows relaxed and calm was restored.</p><p>“What do you want to do?”</p><p>He asked on behalf of Rao Yaoyao. At the same time, he moved slightly to the side between Rao Yaoyao and ‘Bazhun’an’ to prevent anyone from launching a surprise attack on her.</p><p>“It’s very simple…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou really liked this astute Grandmaster. He looked back at Rao Yaoyao and said, “Today, I am merely a simple and warm-hearted citizen. I want to report something.”</p><p>“Report?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao, Teng Shanhai, and Ye Xiao were stunned. They thought that they had heard wrongly.</p><p>“You, the Leader of the Dark Faction want to report something to the official justice of Holy Divine Palace?</p><p>“Is there something wrong with you?!”</p><p>“That’s right, I want to make report.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded. He would not rest until his words gave them a shock:</p><p>“Everyone here is not an outsider. There’s nothing we can’t talk about. I’ll speak frankly.”</p><p>“I want to report that Yama, Water Ghost and the Demi-Saint of the Jiang clan is in collusion with the Northern Region’s Pu Xuan. They conspired to ruin the Lei Family’s Eyes. At the same time, they tried to rehash the massacre of the Lei family in the previous year in an attempt to make a big profit. Now, they have laid a plot at the Lone Cliff and buried hundreds who were at the Sovereign Stage, the Cutting Path Stage and even at the Higher Void level on the continent…”</p><p>“Well, you don’t have to look at me like that. The Jiang clan’s Demi-Saint will be here soon to verify my words if everything goes according to plan.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
