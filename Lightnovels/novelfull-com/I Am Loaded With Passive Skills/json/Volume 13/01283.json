What Kind of Rubbish Are You? ! 1</p><p>Lei Xi’er: “? ? ?”</p><p>“An ordinary Holy Emperor?”</p><p>“A treasure?”</p><p>“Is he for real?”</p><p>Speaking of which, back in the White Cave, she was still in Mu Zixi’s form.</p><p>Although she was the same as everyone else, she knew that Xu Xiaoshou had obtained tremendous benefits in the small White Cave.</p><p>One Vicious Sword that came with four swords, and the other was the Famed Sword, Flame Python.</p><p>The former was Bazhun’an’s former saber, so it was reasonable for Xu Xiaoshou to obtain it. But for the latter, who would think that it was a treasure bestowed by the Holy Emperor?</p><p>Everyone thought that it was a normal opportunity for a normal person, and that it was a normal burst of good luck for him to obtain such an abnormal sword. So be it!</p><p>Now it seemed like…</p><p>“You.” Lei Xi’er gaped and her thoughts suddenly became a little unclear. “Was it really the Holy Emperor?”</p><p>“Mm-Hmm.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded and described the scene he saw at that time:</p><p>“I called him the Wretched Saint…”</p><p>“Should I say it or not? It was true that he appeared at that time… uh, it was just that it didn’t mean that he was forced.”</p><p>“His hands and feet were shackled, and it was as if he sneaked out on a date. Later on, it seemed as if someone found about about this private meeting, and then he ran off in dejection and left behind only a sword. Tsk Tsk…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er: “? ? ? ?”</p><p>“You call this a Holy Emperor?”</p><p>“Suspected, passive points + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could clearly read Lei Xi’er’s facial expression and said,</p><p>“You can doubt his ability, but you can’t doubt my judgment.”</p><p>“At that time, when he appeared, he had Holy Power. I thought he was a Demi-Saint. Now that I think about it, a Demi-Saint probably can’t exude such a great sense of oppression. He could only be a Holy Emperor.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was silent.</p><p>She didn’t ask too specifically about how Xu Xiaoshou had gotten the Flame Python then, because no one would have thought that it was a gift from the Holy Emperor, so why would she ask about it now?</p><p>Glancing at the excited Flame Python, Lei Xi’er said solemnly, “I think there may be risks involved.”</p><p>“The Holy Emperor gave you a treasure for no reason?”</p><p>“How could there be such a good thing in the world?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er didn’t even need to think about it. She felt that this could be a trap.</p><p>“Have more confidence and remove the ‘maybe’.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pinched the Flame Python to calm it down and said with a smile.</p><p>He had long known that the Holy Emperor used him as a chess piece to set up the overall situation for a hundred years.</p><p>There would certainly be risks involved.</p><p>However, when he encountered Demi-Saint Zang Ren last time, so many ‘Wills’ emerged from his body. One of them seemed to belong to the Wretched Saint.</p><p>There was definitely a plot, but there was also goodwill.</p><p>If a little Master Stage was not useful, why would the Holy Emperor give him a treasure?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou put away his sword calmly. At this moment, he did not care about the risks at all. He knew that as long as he continued to be of value and satisfied the Wretched Saint, it was unlikely that anything would happen to him.</p><p>After all, the other party would only give him the sword in advance if he needed something in return.</p><p>Moreover, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know the identity of the Wretched Saint in the past. Now he had learned some things about the Inner island of the Abyss Island through Bazhun’an and so on.</p><p>He also had some speculations about the Wretched Saint.</p><p>“Do you know who the Holy Emperor is?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er coincidentally asked. She knew that Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t someone who was easily manipulated by others, so he must have secretly looked for information about the Holy Emperor.</p><p>“If nothing unexpected happened…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paused and looked at her with a smile. “The Inner Island of the Abyss Island, one of the three ancestors of the White Vein, the ultimate grand ancestor of the Great Infernal Ancestor!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s pupils constricted.</p><p>The Great Infernal Ancestor… She had never heard of him!</p><p>However, with so many prefixes, it was terrifying and unclear!</p><p>“Infernal Ancestor?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er rejected this term quickly and fell into deep thought.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded. “Maybe it’s a demon, but the greater probability could be that it was a previous generation of Elder Sang’s previous generation… perhaps Demi-Saint Infernal’s rise is also thanks to the Great Infernal Ancestor,” he speculated boldly.</p><p>‘Holy Emperor’… Lei Xi’er’s small face was filled with worry. She subconsciously grabbed her silver hair and curled it into two strands, like a pair of ponytails that she would grab when she was thinking.</p><p>After a long time, she said, “After all, he is a Holy Emperor. Perhaps we should be more cautious.”</p><p>“Indeed, we should be cautious, but there’s no need to be too nervous.” Xu Xiaoshou laughed when he heard what she said.</p><p>After he stopped speaking, he suddenly took a deep breath and raised the Famed Sword Flame Python and shouted toward the sky, “Great Infernal Ancestor! Great Infernal Ancestor! I’m coming to find you. Quick, show yourself!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was so scared that her face turned pale. She was completely confused by Xu Xiaoshou’s action.</p><p>“What are you doing!”</p><p>She could not help but reach out to pull Xu Xiaoshou’s sleeve.</p><p>“This was the Holy Emperor! Do you think you’re at the vegetable market selling vegetables, shouting in that manner? Are you courting death?”</p><p>“There was no response…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was pulled back and let out a long sigh. “I just don’t know the Great Infernal Ancestor’s real name. Otherwise, maybe I could really call the old man out to meet me.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was still in a daze. She did not understand why Xu Xiaoshou, who used to be so afraid of death, would become so impudent after coming to the Abyss Island.</p><p>“Are you crazy?”</p><p>“I’m not crazy.”</p><p>“Then you…”</p><p>“I have a trump card.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled and took out the ‘Four Pillars of Destiny Token’ from his ring:</p><p>“The Master of the Black and White Veins is Bazhun’an. This is the Command Token he gave me.”</p><p>“It’s said that when you see a Command Token, it’s like seeing a person. It won’t work for weaker Spiritual Cultivators, but we have to give face to anyone who has a bit of knowledge.”</p><p>“I was thinking that if we call out to the Great Infernal Ancestor, maybe we’ll have one more great bodyguard. This way, we’ll be much safer on the Abyss Island.”</p><p>Even now, Xu Xiaoshou was still brooding over the loss of Xiao Kongtong, the great bodyguard from Fringe Moon Immortal City.</p><p>Lei Xi’er: “…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
