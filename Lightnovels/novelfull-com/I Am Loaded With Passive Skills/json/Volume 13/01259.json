Then you must be Teacher!”</p><p>Some time ago, Xiu Yuanke thought that the person in front of him was disguised as Eldest Senior Brother.</p><p>However, after reading the Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict, the phenomenon of the Five Regions, and the few imperial edicts that said ‘Swallow the Mountains and Rivers’, no matter how stupid he was, he still realized something.</p><p>This stage was not something that Eldest Senior Brother was capable of.</p><p>Xiu Yuanke still vaguely remembered that when he was in Fringe Moon Immortal City, Eldest Senior Brother had said that he might meet his Teacher on this mission, so he decided to participate.</p><p>But he had never thought that they would meet so quickly.</p><p>He had just arrived at the Lone Cliff, and coincidentally, he saw the instant scene of his Teacher announcing his return to the Five Regions.</p><p>To a fanatical admirer of the Eighth Sword Deity, this was no different from Lord Ye Gong actually encountering a real dragon, and a devout believer encountering a miracle.</p><p>It was simply…</p><p>Like a dream!</p><p>Bazhun’an was still in a daze.</p><p>“Teacher?”</p><p>“When did I take in an unfamiliar disciple?”</p><p>“It can’t be that this fellow is also Xu Xiaoshou, right?”</p><p>“It’s me…”</p><p>Xiu Yuanke saw his Teacher’s blank expression. He pointed at himself and said,</p><p>“I, Xiu Yuanke, a Swordsman from Fringe Moon Immortal City!”</p><p>“The Nine Major Sword Techniques were taught by Eldest Senior Brother. Eldest Senior Brother also told me that after meeting Teacher and obtaining your approval, I would be qualified to practice Sword Cognition.”</p><p>This…</p><p>Cen Qiaofu and Water Ghost’s expressions immediately became strange.</p><p>“So after sparing him for so long, he was actually one of their own?”</p><p>Since he was Xiao Kongtong’s junior brother, it was obvious that this trivial matter should be handled by Bazhun’an. The two of them immediately lost the desire to deal with him.</p><p>Bazhun’an finally realized that this Xiu Yuanke belonged to one out of ten million people on the continent who claimed to be his student.</p><p>As for Sword Cognition…</p><p>“Amazing!”</p><p>Bazhun’an obviously didn’t expect that Xiao Kongtong would pass the ball back to his court.</p><p>How could he have any spare time to teach an irrelevant Swordsman the ‘Sword Cognition’ skill?</p><p>Even an important person like Xu Xiaoshou was given the Sword Observation Manual by Xiao Kongtong. From this, one could see how stretched Bazhun’an was for time.</p><p>There were thousands like Xiu Yuanke.</p><p>If Bazhun’an really were to spend his time guiding each one of his admirers, then there would probably be no ‘Master Siren’ in this world. Instead, there would be a ‘Master Bazhun’an’…</p><p>The important thing was…</p><p>Now that Sky City was about to fall, it was really not the appropriate time to discuss such trivial matters.</p><p>“Wait a moment.”</p><p>Bazhun’an said gently to Xiu Yuanke.</p><p>“Good, good! I can wait! I can wait for any length of time!”</p><p>Xiu Yuanke was so excited. When his idol spoke to him, he felt as if a flower had bloomed above his head. He couldn’t be happier.</p><p>“Let’s collect the net first.”</p><p>Bazhun’an turned to Water Ghost and said.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Water Ghost nodded indifferently.</p><p>As soon as Sky City fell, he knew that the big net he had laid at the bottom of the Lone Cliff should be able to collect all the big fish.</p><p>Without any hesitation, he spun the Water-type Upanishad Formation under his feet.</p><p>At this moment, the three people on the ruins of the Lone Cliff ruins couldn’t help looking over.</p><p>Xiu Yuanke was secretly shocked.</p><p>“This was the power of the ‘Upanishad Formation’!”</p><p>“This person didn’t look young, and he didn’t look like Yu Lingdi, the Spirit Division Chief of the Holy Divine Palace. Then who was he?”</p><p>The point was that his Teacher wasn’t Eldest Senior Brother in disguise, so the people around him should be real bigwigs, right?</p><p>It was very likely that each of them was a Saint Servant Nine Thrones!</p><p>“Oh my God!”</p><p>Xiu Yuanke felt that he had come into contact with a group of people with the highest status at the top of the world.</p><p>He glanced at Cen Qiaofu again and thought it was good that nothing unexpected happened as he might have caused an accident just now…</p><p>This Elder should be Cen Qiaofu himself.</p><p>“What on earth was I thinking of just now?”</p><p>Thinking of this, Xiu Yuanke was so embarrassed that he almost covered his face and burrowed into the ground.</p><p>Fortunately, Cen Qiaofu didn’t care about such trivial matters. After finding out that Xiu Yuanke was one of his own, and now when he saw this little Swordsman stealing a glance at him, he put the past behind him and smiled to indicate that there was no need to hold any grudges.</p><p>“Good man!”</p><p>Xiu Yuanke was so touched that he almost cried. As expected, the people around his Teacher were all extremely good people!</p><p>As his thoughts wandered, in a flash, Water Ghost had already completed the seal formation, and the strong Spiritual Source on his body rippled out.</p><p>Xiu Yuanke and Cen Qiaofu did not move at all.</p><p>On the contrary, Bazhun’an was swept away by the aura, his footsteps faltered and he almost fell.</p><p>Before Cen Qiaofu could take action, Xiu Yuanke helped him up first.</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>After Bazhun’an thanked him, Xiu Yuanke suddenly forgot about everything else. He looked at his teacher’s hands with a burning gaze. He had already made up his mind..</p><p>In the next few decades, he would never wash his hands again!</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>When the Water-type Upanishad Formation was pushed to its limit, the sea of clouds in the Lone Cliff shook and the sound of waves crashing against the shore was heard.</p><p>Then, under the push of the current, the vast Deep Sea under the cliff shrank, turning into a floating ball that was dozens of feet in size. Under the guidance of the Sea God’s Trident, it slowly rose above the sea of clouds.</p><p>“Deep Sea World!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s eyes were solemn.</p><p>This was Water Ghost’s Bounded Domain, the ‘Deep Sea World’ that had merged with the Sea God’s Trident.</p><p>From the outside of this world, he could see a vague, shrunken figure. Upon closer inspection, there were a lot of familiar people inside.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
