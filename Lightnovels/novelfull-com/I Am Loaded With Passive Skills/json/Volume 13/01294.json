(3)</p><p>“Hohoho!”</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>It was an affirmative response.</p><p>Seeing the conceited looks on the two’s faces as if they wanted to start a big fight right now, Xu Xiaoshou laughed.</p><p>He pointed at the Void Suppression Stele on the ground and said, “You guys have indeed become stronger, but let’s make a bet. There’s no need to talk about beating up others. Just this piece of broken stone, you guys can’t lift it.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Ember was stunned.</p><p>It was the first not convinced!</p><p>Now that it had received the power of the Infernal Original Seed, it was invincible. How could it not lift a piece of broken stone?</p><p>“Hohoho!”</p><p>Get out of the way, I would do it!</p><p>Ember pushed away Ice. It bent down and sneered at the stone below that was not even as big as its fingernail.</p><p>It bent its finger.</p><p>With a flick.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The intense infernal white flame exploded. The powerful Recoil caused the space to ripple and a strong wind started blowing in the surroundings.</p><p>Lei Xi’er raised her eyebrows. She could not believe that such a light touch could cause such a strong energy ripple.</p><p>However…</p><p>Sovereign Physique.</p><p>This was at the same physical body level as Xu Xiaoshou. Looking at Ember’s physique of Infernal White Skeleton, its current physical body could be even stronger than Xu Xiaoshou’s.</p><p>Then it was fine.</p><p>In front of the Void Suppression Stele, Ember knew that Xu Xiaoshou would not simply joke around. In fact, it had already used up some of its strength.</p><p>However, after a flick, the Void Suppression Stele did not move at all. Instead, it was shaken back three steps.</p><p>“Huh?” Ember looked over in disbelief.</p><p>“Huh?” Xu Xiaoshou smiled and imitating its tone, he also let out a “Huh”.</p><p>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”</p><p>Ember felt that he was ridiculed and jumped up and down in anger.</p><p>After that, it calmed down and then seriously stretched out two fingers, pinching the Void Suppression Stele.</p><p>“Bang! Bang!”</p><p>The earth shattered with a bang. Ember’s two huge feet sank into the deep pit, but it could only move the Void Suppression Stele a little.</p><p>“Hohoho!”</p><p>This broken stone was too small, so it was not easy to use force!</p><p>Ember turned around to complain, indicating that it was not its fault for not picking it up as the Void Suppression Stele was too small.</p><p>“Look at me.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled. Golden light blossomed all over his body. The moment the Exploding Posture was activated, both of his hands directly lifted the Void Suppression Stele.</p><p>Ember was stunned.</p><p>Ice was stunned too. From Ember’s performance, Ice could tell how heavy the stone was. But their owner could lift it in an instant.</p><p>Was he a real human?</p><p>He must be a transformed White Skeleton giant!</p><p>Lei Xi’er was also speechless.</p><p>Without comparison, she would feel what Xu Xiaoshou did was normal.</p><p>The moment these two huge White Skeleton giants appeared, she realized that Xu Xiaoshou’s physical strength was simply at the level of a fierce beast!</p><p>“Give me your hand.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not hold on any longer. He quickly pretended to be calm and said to Ember.</p><p>Ember reached its hand, trembling. Without a trace of politeness, Xu Xiaoshou handed over the Void Suppression Stele.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>In an instant, Ember’s body pounced forward. His overlapping hands were pounded to the ground by the Void Suppression Stele. He also fell to the ground.</p><p>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”</p><p>Ember was furious.</p><p>This was an accident. He did not use his full strength just now.</p><p>“Roar?”</p><p>Ice could not stand watching from the side anymore. It signaled to Ember if it needed help.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>No need!</p><p>The stubborn Infernal White Skeleton Ember used all his strength. It finally lifted the Void Suppression Stele high up and placed it on its shoulder.</p><p>“Hohoho!”</p><p>This time, Ember was happy. It was as if it had accomplished something that gave him a special sense of accomplishment. He gestured to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>You lost. I had already lifted this broken stone.</p><p>“So powerful!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clapped and sighed. “As expected of you, Ember. So powerful… well, since you’re so powerful, I’ll leave the mission of carrying the Void Suppression Stele to you. Let’s go and find the treasure!”</p><p>Ember was stunned.</p><p>Ice was speechless.</p><p>Lei Xi’er was lost for words.</p><p>Her eyes twitched as she watched.</p><p>This was really cheating!</p><p>“Condemned, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Hohoho…”</p><p>Ember was about to cry. It hinted that this broken stone was really heavy. Could it put it down?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled as he jumped onto Ember’s head and gestured for Lei Xi’er to get on the mount, Ice.</p><p>Then, he patted the head of the White Skeleton giant beneath him and said, “You don’t carry your bag when you go shopping and let your girlfriend do? That’s not good, Ember.”</p><p>Ember was dumbfounded.</p><p>Ice was dumbfounded too.</p><p>Lei Xi’er was lost for words.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
