Bazhun’an, in that state, was the only person who was stronger than him and could give him an answer.</p><p>He came back to his senses, and the scene returned to Lone Cliff again.</p><p>The background was a majestic ancient city with raging flames and falling like a meteorite.</p><p>Above the dark cliff, there was an elder with a one-armed cripple kneeling piously. In front of him, Bazhun’an calmly stretched out his hand and crooked his finger.</p><p>“Sword.”</p><p>There was a crack.</p><p>“Clagn!” After the mahogany sword case on Xiu Yuanke’s back cracked, a wide and long mahogany sword flew out. It drew a bright arc of sword light in Nine Heavens and fell into Bazhun’an’s hand.</p><p>Water Ghost took a deep breath when he saw this scene.</p><p>A moment ago, he had thought it was crazy that Bazhun’an had chosen Xiu Yuanke to block the city instead of him. However, he couldn’t disobey him but followed his order to move back.</p><p>Now, he felt calm.</p><p>“Why can’t I trust this person?”</p><p>Bazhun’an held the mahogany sword in his left hand on the cliff, and his right hand slowly slid across the blade.</p><p>Wherever his gaze landed, the peach wood sword would shine with a white radiance inch by inch.</p><p>“Schwing!”</p><p>Even though Xiu Yuanke wasn’t the one wielding the sword, he could feel the joy of his saber and see the psychokinesis coming from the peach wood saber after his teacher’s fingertip passed through it..</p><p>This was sword cognition!</p><p>Moreover, Xiu Yuanke even felt that his saber had seen his teacher as the new master after being touched!</p><p>As long as his teacher wanted to, this saber seemed to be able to Heavenly Unravel!</p><p>It was simply..</p><p>Unbelievable!</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>The flames behind him lit up the darkness, illuminating the figures on the cliff. The booming sounds were incessant as if it was the end of the world.</p><p>“What is the name of the sword?” Bazhun’an asked calmly.</p><p>As Xiu Yuanke raised his eyes, his gaze passed his teacher and looked at the ancient city that was within reach. He was panicking, not understanding why his teacher could be so calm.</p><p>“Immortal Peach,” he replied in fear.</p><p>“Immortal Peach, the wood sword…”</p><p>“What a nice name.”</p><p>Bazhun’an suddenly moved his left four fingers and gently held Immortal Peach.</p><p>At this moment, the blade of the wood sword surged with white light, and the sound of the sword rang in the air.</p><p>“Schwing!”</p><p>Xiu Yuanke’s instantly had goosebumps and felt that the surrounding space and time slowed down along with the sword singing!</p><p>Bazhun’an sensed the surging power contained within the wooden sword that was similar to him and said in slight astonishment, “You’re hiding a sword?”</p><p>“Yes!” Xiu Yuanke was nervous and scared. “I’ve been hiding a sword for thirteen years, four months, and 26 days, sir…”</p><p>Bazhun’an had a faint smile.</p><p>If so, Xiu Yuanke might still be able to survive after the sword strike.</p><p>“Close your eyes.”</p><p>A gentle voice sounded. Xiu Yuanke did not understand, but he did as he was told.</p><p>“Stretch out your hand.”</p><p>He stretched out his hand and felt some weight on his palm, which came from Immortal Peach Sword.</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>As he closed his eyes, the booming sounds in his ears became even more ear-piercing.</p><p>Xiu Yuanke was so nervous that his entire body tensed up. He was excited to receive the sword from his teacher, but there was also the fear that he was not qualified enough.</p><p>This should be a moment that the Eldest Senior Brother would be envious of, right?</p><p>“Relax and focus.”</p><p>Xiu Yuanke immediately relaxed.</p><p>“Meditate.”</p><p>He focused his mind and suddenly felt that the noise in his ears seemed to have quieted down a little.</p><p>“Next, I will transmit my Way of the Sword to you. As for how much you can learn, it all depends on your comprehensive skills,” Bazhun’an said with an emotionless voice and stretched out a finger.</p><p>Xiu Yuanke was so excited that he was about to start trembling again.</p><p>“Relax.”</p><p>The voice came again.</p><p>At this moment, Xiu Yuanke put everything down and followed his teacher’s guidance.</p><p>At one point, he felt a warmth between his eyebrows, which should be the power coming from his teacher’s finger pointed.</p><p>“Buzz…”</p><p>In the next second, Xiu Yuanke felt his soul tremble. The world became quiet.</p><p>Behind them, Cen Qiaofu and Shui Gui saw the Bazhun’an touch between Xiu Yuanke’s eyebrows. A strong power of time and spatial power spread out.</p><p>Visible ripples spread out into the void, merging with the Way of the Heavens.</p><p>In the next second..</p><p>The world stopped!</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Shock flashed in Water Ghost’s eyes.</p><p>How long had it been since he had seen Bazhun’an make a move?</p><p>However, Bazhun’an, who was still in a sealed sword state, could even affect space and time just by passing down his sword.</p><p>He tried his best to look around.</p><p>The flowers, plants, and trees stopped swaying. The sound of the wind and the cries of beasts turned silent. At this moment, the blazing flames at the tail of Sky City, which had fallen from the sky, stopped flashing..</p><p>“Is this fu*king Acquired Realm?”</p><p>“This is fu*king called the weak state?”</p><p>Water Ghost was absent-minded.</p><p>Bazhun’an was weak, but even just an iceberg of his leaking power frightened a master of Water-type Upanishad.</p><p>What would happen if he unsealed the sword…</p><p>How would the world change with Bazhun’an sword?</p><p>“Thump!”</p><p>Along with Shui Gui and Cen Qiaofu, Xiu Yuanke also felt incredulous.</p><p>At this moment, he felt that the world had disappeared. In his mind, he and his teacher were the only ones left in this world.</p><p>“There’s wind…”</p><p>An ethereal voice came to him.</p><p>In the Fantasy Sword Technique world, Xiu Yuanke felt the sound of the wind around him.</p><p>“Someone…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
