Thus they were unable to react at the first instant.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, the situation that you are talking about is the worst-case scenario. The Inner Island of the Abyss Island’s seal has been like this for tens of thousands of years. I’m afraid that Bazhun’an alone isn’t enough to break the seal.”</p><p>Yan Wuse was the first to express his view.</p><p>The Inner Island of the Abyss Island had so many holy emperor-level existences. However, they still couldn’t break the seal even after so many years.</p><p>Even with the addition of Bazhun’an, and the power within was as powerful as a strand of rope, he couldn’t ignore the Spell Forbidden Barrier.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked over with a smile and said, “When the judicial department sentenced Bazhun’an to the Inner island of the Abyss Island, they didn’t expect him to become the Master of the black and white veins. He could even kill his way back to the five regions without anyone knowing, under the suppression of the Spell Forbidden Barrier and the weapon prohibition order.”</p><p>After he said that, everyone fell silent.</p><p>Indeed, Bazhun’an was unlike a human at all.</p><p>No one could imagine that the guy who was only at the higher void cultivation level and couldn’t even get the title of Seven Sword Deity could take down the living fossil-like Holy Emperors when he entered the Inner Island of Abyss Island.</p><p>How did he do it?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang smiled and said, “Starting from the worst-case scenario and dealing with it, every transformation, no matter how bad it is, is essentially developing in a good direction, isn’t it?”</p><p>Everyone was silent.</p><p>You had the brain. You were right.</p><p>“So, what do you plan to do?” Yan Wuse asked.</p><p>“In recent years, the frequency of the opening of extradimensional space in the five regions has increased. Among them, the probability of the birth of the original ghost beast remained the same as before. However, those who escaped from Abyss Island have greatly increased.</p><p>“It’s not difficult to see that ever since Bazhun’an broke out of the Inner Island of the Abyss Island, they have started to take action on their scheme.</p><p>“Moreover, it’s quite impressive!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked around at everyone. Seeing that no one was refuting him or giving him a suggestion, he continued.</p><p>“My view is that breaking the seal is difficult, but strengthening the seal is simple…</p><p>“We don’t even need to strengthen it. The Inner Island of the Abyss Island has the essence of the Seven Breaks. We only need to make a slight move before Bazhun’an and the others succeed so that the Seven Breaks will restore the essence of the order of the land of exile.</p><p>“In this way, the Saint Servant’s many plans will all be for naught.”</p><p>A “plop” sounded.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang tapped his finger on the round table, and the echo in the great hall reverberated.</p><p>In the silence, everyone felt as if the clouds had cleared and the sun had risen. The situation instantly turned from crisis to clarity.</p><p>That was right!</p><p>The Inner Island of the Abyss Island couldn’t even kill Bazhun’an with his strong physiques.</p><p>Now that he had returned, he would definitely have multiple Holy Emperor’s wills. It would be as difficult as ascending to the heavens to take him down.</p><p>However, if Bazhun’an’s problem could not be solved, they could trouble him to solve the problem of timing and place.</p><p>No matter how strong a person was, how long could he last?</p><p>If Bazhun’an could overturn the situation in the five regions by himself, he would have not remained silent for so many years after escaping from the Abyss Island and choosing to accumulate his strength.</p><p>Before hearing these words from Dao Qiongcang, everyone had known that Bazhun’an had established the Saint Servant to take advantage of the faction of the Inner Island of Abyss Island.</p><p>The Inner Island of the Abyss Island was one of the Seven Breaks. So how could it be so easy to break the seal?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
