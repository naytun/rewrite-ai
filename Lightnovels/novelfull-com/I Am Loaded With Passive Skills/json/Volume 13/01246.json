Huang Quan was still a little uncertain.</p><p>The power of Five Decays of Heaven and Man was very strange. If used well in this deep sea, it might even be more effective against the demi-saint than Shang Xuan Sword or Hun Che.</p><p>Since the other party wanted to stay…</p><p>Then he would carry the Five Decays of Heaven and Man of the Deva. It would then be a matter of whether the Jiang clan’s demi-saint would die first, or Huang Quan would bring bad luck ahead of time!</p><p>“Is it him?”</p><p>While he was thinking, Huang Quan saw that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had turned his head and looked to his left. He stretched out his finger.</p><p>“Someone is there?”</p><p>Spiritual senses could not be used because of the barrier in the deep sea. After Huang Quan turned his head, he could not see anyone.</p><p>However, in less than a few seconds, a black dot appeared in the distance. It turned into a human figure and stopped in front of them.</p><p>“Demi-saint, Jiang Buyi!”</p><p>Huang Quan’s heart skipped a beat. He felt the strong pressure of a demi-saint, but he couldn’t help but turn his head to look at the demi-saint beside him.</p><p>He didn’t expect that he couldn’t use his spiritual senses.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man, this old fellow, actually had better eyesight than him. He was able to discover Jiang Buyi’s arrival so long in advance.</p><p>“Keng–”</p><p>Huang Quan placed his hands on the swords behind him. He slowly unsheathed the two supreme divine weapons, Shang Xuan Sword and Hun Che.</p><p>Inside the Spell Forbidden Barrier.</p><p>Spiritual source was ineffective, saint’s origin was ineffective</p><p>Spiritual senses were ineffective, saint’s will was ineffective</p><p>The power of attributes could not be used, and all kinds of spiritual techniques could not be used</p><p>The gap between a demi-saint and a higher void was reduced to a true demi-saint and a naturally born sacred physique.</p><p>Shang Xuan Sword could make up for this small gap.</p><p>Moreover, Huang Quan had an additional Hun Che.</p><p>Fighting against a demi-saint under such circumstances, even as a higher void, what was there to be afraid of?</p><p>“Jiang Buyi…”</p><p>With the Shang Xuan Sword in his left hand and Hun Che in his right hand, Huang Quan’s eyes, hidden under the golden mask, were filled with madness. He sneered and said, “I heard that you are looking for me, and you want to take all of the Lei family’s eyes from Yama?”</p><p>Demi-saint Jiang Buyi used his real body to chase after Huang Quan. He was surprised to see that Huang Quan’s real body was not like his space-time clone, which was suppressed till it could not speak to him at all.</p><p>On the contrary, he even dared to exchange blows with swords.</p><p>For a moment, he was in a daze.</p><p>“Shang Xuan Sword? Hun Che?”</p><p>Flames ignited in Jiang Buyi’s eyes. He really didn’t expect that apart from Huang Quan and Lei family’s eyes, he would also obtain two supreme divine weapons during this operation.</p><p>This was a supreme treasure comparable to Ai Cangsheng’s evil sin bow!</p><p>However, very quickly, Jiang Buyi’s gaze moved away from Huang Quan.</p><p>He had a whim when he arrived at this place.</p><p>However, when he faced Huang Quan’s true body this time, he vaguely sensed that the source of the whim did not seem to be this person, but…</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s gaze shifted to the unremarkable orange-masked man behind Huang Quan.</p><p>With just a glance, he sensed a familiar scent.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
