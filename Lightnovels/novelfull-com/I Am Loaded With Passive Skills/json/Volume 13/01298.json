He stole a glance at the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale from the corner of his eyes. Seeing that there was no danger, he continued.</p><p>“Lord Void Attendant, I feel that this mission’s level should be raised.</p><p>“Of course, I’m not here for any mission reward. I just feel that this mission is quite dangerous. After all, the intruder is at the higher void level.</p><p>“I definitely want to accomplish the mission. When the mission level is raised, the reward can just follow the mission level. There’s no need to intentionally give me an extra reward.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze was sincere. He wondered if the void attendant’s spiritual intelligence was high or not. Could he hear the hidden meaning behind his words?</p><p>Lei Xi’er was stunned.</p><p>Was this something that could be bargained?</p><p>“Received Concern, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>The void attendant sounded impatient. He said gravely, “Sinner number 800802, please execute the mission immediately!”</p><p>He did not answer!</p><p>The Holy Emperor Dragon Scale still did not show an increase in the heartbeat. Xu Xiaoshou pondered for a moment and said.</p><p>“Lord Void Attendant, I did not commit any crimes outside. I was just victimized by a scoundrel and sent to Abyss Island. Actually, I am a good person…”</p><p>“I’m new here. I don’t know what the rules of Abyss Island are. Can you tell me roughly how the level of this mission was derived?</p><p>“And what’s the use of this Void Crystal?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was like a curious kid. His mind was filled with 100,000 questions.</p><p>“You’re so flattering.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er couldn’t bear to see the way he behaved anymore. She said in telepathic communication.</p><p>“This is called a gentleman.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not even turn his head as he said in telepathic communication, “A wise man foresees and mitigates risks. We should at least know something. This void attendant seems to have developed limbs and is very smart. Maybe we can obtain some information from him.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was lost for words.</p><p>“Received Concern, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>At this moment, the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale suddenly jumped violently.</p><p>“Thump thump! Thump thump!”</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked, but he saw that the void attendant no longer spoke to him. Instead, he turned his head and looked in Lei Xi’er’s direction.</p><p>“Sinner number 152384, another mission is assigned now…”</p><p>F*ck!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou instantly panicked.</p><p>Could it be a mission for Lei Xi’er to kill him?</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>He suddenly jumped up to stop it. After attracting the void attendant’s gaze, he said righteously, “Lord Void Attendant, where is the intruder you mentioned? I want to kill him now!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was silent.</p><p>The void attendant was silent too.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The void attendant didn’t say anything else. He was extremely impatient now. With a shift of his foot, a corpse-like figure appeared in the cracked ground below.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Double Dumba*s saw the sun again and looked up at the sky furiously.</p><p>He had been crushed by the void attendant many times along the way. It was due to the Dissolve attribute that he could survive.</p><p>At this time, the pain had become numb and it could no longer trigger any change of emotion in Double Dumba*s.</p><p>However, when he was beneath the void attendant’s feet just now and heard the conversation between the sinner number 800820 and the void attendant, he was really angry.</p><p>“I’ve become a trade item!”</p><p>The sinner had tried to get more and trade more. The void attendant might not be able to get it due to his low spiritual intelligence. However, how could Double Dumba*s not get it?</p><p>He widened his eyes and wanted to see what that scoundrel looked like.</p><p>At a glance…</p><p>“Xu, Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was far on top of the tall white skeleton giant’s head.</p><p>But how could Double Dumba*s forget this face?</p><p>In the Shengshen Continent, this face was his only hope before he obtained the Holy Miracle Fruit.</p><p>A Master (Stage) junior, but his head could be exchanged for Saint Ascension resources with Three Incenses. It was a rare sight in a thousand years!</p><p>“It’s you!”</p><p>Double Dumba*s barely managed to regain some mobility. He immediately took out the pills and swallowed them. He then dissolve and gathered himself before standing up.</p><p>He looked behind him.</p><p>At this moment, after Xu Xiaoshou accepted the “void mission”, the void attendant no longer hit him. It seemed that it also did not intend to interfere in the battle between the two parties.</p><p>It crossed its arms across its chest and retreated to a long distance. It looked at the battlefield with interest like a prison warden who had been bored for thousands of years and finally saw activity in his prison again.</p><p>“The hope of Life!”</p><p>Light resumed in the eyes of Double Dumba*s.</p><p>As long as the void attendant did not make a move, even the mere Master (Stage) had monstrous means, could he still fail miserably?!</p><p>“It’s actually you…”</p><p>On the head of the Infernal White Skeleton Ember, Xu Xiaoshou looked down at the person who was bathed in blood and was shocked too.</p><p>Double Dumba*s, a gold hunting token killer of Three Incenses, had wanted his head in Shengshen Continent. The information was obtained by reading the soul memories before Xu Xiaoshou killed his fellow killer.</p><p>“Good fellow, I don’t even need a void mission. If I had known it was you, I would have just struck with my sword directly.” Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and laughed. He immediately took out the Flame Python and the Fourth Sword.</p><p>“Who is he?” Lei Xi’er’s God Devil Eyes swirled as she asked warily. This was a higher void. Even though he was currently in a weakened state, it wasn’t easy to kill him.</p><p>“An enemy.”</p><p>“You really want to kill him?”</p><p>“Definitely!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled.</p><p>He had looked for this Double Dumba*s in the deep sea world. Unfortunately, he didn’t find him.</p><p>If it were at any other time when Double Dumba*s was in his peak state, perhaps he would have turned around and left.</p><p>However, the combat strength of this fellow had clearly been reduced to less than 10% by the void attendants. If he still couldn’t take him down, wouldn’t he let down the name of the Heavenly Image State of Master (Stage)?</p><p>“Sinner number 800802, sinner number 152384, please carry out the mission immediately!”</p><p>At the back, the giant void attendant who was standing with his arms crossed couldn’t wait any longer and urge.</p><p>Hearing this, Double Dumba*s recalled Xu Xiaoshou’s bargaining just now. He suddenly turned his head and looked at the void attendant.</p><p>“Lord Void Attendant, may I ask if I am an intruder now, but if I kill this sinner of Abyss Island, would I be considered guilty and qualified to join the sinners of Abyss Island?”</p><p>When he was being hunted, Double Dumba*s had never thought that he could still reason with…</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou’s appearance undoubtedly brought him light.</p><p>It could be done this way.</p><p>Double Dumba*s knew that if he could not obtain the void attendant’s guarantee, even if he killed the two people in front of him, he would still end up buried in the hands of the void attendant.</p><p>“Not her.”</p><p>The void attendant pondered for a long time. His gaze swept past Lei Xi’er and finally fell on Xu Xiaoshou. As if he had not spoken normally for a long time, he stuttered and said, “But him. If you kill him, you can replace his sinner number.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>“Good fellow!”</p><p>He had asked so many questions but the void attendant did not respond. Double Dumba*s only said one sentence but the void attendant had actually answered. Obviously, there were two very different treatments… Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but call him a good fellow!</p><p>Was this serious?</p><p>What about the law of Abyss Island? You decided everything by your say, did you?</p><p>Lei Xi’er was also stunned.</p><p>Sure enough, even the void attendant couldn’t stand Xu Xiaoshou’s nagging!</p><p>And he wanted to kill Abyss Island’s sinner using the intruder’s hand!</p><p>“How can it be so easy to be Abyss Island’s sinner? You can’t even leave your name on the Void Suppression Stele!” Xu Xiaoshou sneered at Double Dumba*s.</p><p>Forget about the Shengshen Continent. On Abyss Island, you still wanted to make use of my head?</p><p>“Ice, Ember, take him down!”</p><p>Without giving Double Dumba*s any more time, Xu Xiaoshou immediately gave the order.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, he lifted his two swords and jumped down from Ember’s head.</p><p>While he was flying, he also conveniently brought with him the Void Suppression Stele that was honking.</p><p>He had indeed spent a lot of effort to shift it here.</p><p>Void Suppression Stele, Void Suppression Stele…</p><p>If it wasn’t to suppress the higher void, there was no point in naming it such a name!</p><p>“Lei Xi’er, find a chance to control him. I’ll leave Greedy the Cat Spirit to you. Once you have the chance, control him to death!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not plan to fight alone.</p><p>He had Ember and Ice in the three-lineup arrangement. He could also form a three-way team with Lei Xi’er and Greedy the Cat Spirit. Couldn’t they work together to beat him up?</p><p>If they were to engage in a gentleman’s battle, it would be pure madness.</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit showed up. In a daze, he flew toward the female master first.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>The battle immediately started.</p><p>Subsequent to the sound of the swords, the black sword light was the first to fly over.</p><p>As soon as he entered the stage, Xu Xiaoshou used the Fourth Sword.</p><p>Not to mention Double Dumba*s was currently in a weakened state, even if he was at his peak, as long as he was hit by Fourth Sword, he would probably be doomed!</p><p>Master (Stage)…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that he was only a Master (Stage).</p><p>However, the reason why he dared to be so stubborn was that all the equipment and skills he had on him were all for the sake of surpassing his stage.</p><p>No matter how hard it was to kill Yi, he was already dead.</p><p>You, Double Dumba*s, how could you be harder to kill than Yi?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
