It was very difficult to mobilize the Spiritual Source.</p><p>“Pfft…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried to condense the Infernal Fire Seed.</p><p>Only after a full breath of time was he able to fully manifest his ability.</p><p>“In other words, even if it’s the Higher Void level, as long as it belongs to a Spiritual Cultivator, it will be restricted by the Earth Order and will be extremely uncomfortable in battle.”</p><p>“If I need to use my Spiritual Cultivation Ability, it will take me quite a while. Then even if the Higher Void level is stronger than me, it will still take half an instant before it can use any attacking means.”</p><p>“Half an instant is a very long time.”</p><p>“In other words… This is my domain!”</p><p>Thinking about this, Xu Xiaoshou became excited.</p><p>Not only was he a Spiritual Cultivator, he was also a Physique Cultivator, and he was also an Ancient Swordsman.</p><p>The latter two were not restricted by the Earth Order of this place at all. He could attack at will, and both skills could be used instantly.</p><p>In addition to his strange Passive Skill…</p><p>If he really wanted to fight here, he could take advantage of the Spiritual Cultivator’s delay when it came to condensing attacks, then to get rid of the Higher Void level shouldn’t be too difficult, right?</p><p>“One can never be too careful…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shed his arrogance and proceeded to assess his own situation.</p><p>“The head bodyguard, Xiao Kongtong, had disappeared, and the hostage, Situ Yongren, has also flown away. I’m alone now, and I still need a partner…”</p><p>With that thought, he opened his Yuan Mansion.</p><p>On the Outer Island of the Abyss Island, as expected, there was no Spell Forbidden Barrier. There were only some irritating rules and regulations.</p><p>However, this was definitely not all of Xu Xiaoshou’s various means.</p><p>Not long after, the Spatial Passageway opened and a girl dressed in black walked out.</p><p>“This is?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er had just stepped onto the grounds when she sensed that the rules of this world were different from those of the Shengshen continent. She looked at Xu Xiaoshou in confusion.</p><p>“Do you still remember what I said before? The next time we meet, I’ll bring you to a good place,” Xu Xiaoshou said with a smile.</p><p>Lei Xi’er, who was in the Sovereign Stage level, had the Bounded Domain, White Cave Small World, and even the God Devil Eyes that Rao Yaoyao could control.</p><p>In this place, if she cooperated with him, she might even be able to trick a Demi-Saint.</p><p>This was an excellent fighter!</p><p>“So?” Lei Xi’er was indifferent.</p><p>“This…” Xu Xiaoshou pointed at the ground. “Abyss Island.”</p><p>“Abyss Island?” Lei Xi’er was stunned.</p><p>“Why did they come to Abyss Island?”</p><p>The last time they met, they were still at the Lone Cliff in the Yunlun Mountain Range.</p><p>No matter how much trouble Xu Xiaoshou caused, how could he get to Abyss Island in just a few days?</p><p>“Is the Abyss Island you’re talking about a training ground called ‘Abyss Island’ in the Yunlun Mountain Range, or… ?”</p><p>“It’s located in the Yunlun Mountain Range. It’s in the Yunlun Mountain Range now, but the training ground…” Xu Xiaoshou replied.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought for a moment and nodded. “That’s right. It’s also a training ground. It’s the kind of place that has the Foundational Roots of Saint Ascension.”</p><p>“Wasn’t this the Sacred Abyss Island, Sky City?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s red lips parted slightly. She was a little stunned.</p><p>“How did he end up here?”</p><p>“Was this realistic?”</p><p>Based on Xu Xiaoshou’s inertia, there was no place in the Eastern Region for him to blow up. Now, he was going to wreak havoc on the Abyss Island?</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er opened her mouth and was about to say something, but she hesitated.</p><p>She had only been locked up in the Yuan Mansion World for such a short period of time, yet she felt that she was so out of touch with the world. What was going on?</p><p>“Hehe, don’t worry about the process. It’s just a small matter. Anyway, now that we’re here on the Abyss Island, we have to be on guard against some people. You’d better be mentally prepared.” Xu Xiaoshou indicated that it was a long story, so it was better not to say it.</p><p>“Be on guard against who?” Lei Xi’er glanced forward, sizing up this legendary world that she had heard of since she was a child.</p><p>“The Demi Saint from the Jiang clan of the Northern Region.” Xu Xiaoshou stared intently at the silver-haired girl in front of him. He knew that perhaps these words could cause her to have some special reaction.</p><p>“The Jiang clan…” as he predicted, after Lei Xi’er was stunned, her God Devil Eyes suddenly released a thick black and white fog. She suddenly turned to stare at him. “What did you say?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed. “As expected, the Jiang Clan and the Lei family have some sort of bond…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was silent for a moment and said softly, “The Lei family was destroyed. The Jiang Clan, the Demi-Saint of the Northern Region, was one of the accomplices.”</p><p>“Was it a feud?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had thought of this long ago.</p><p>Jiang Xian was able to produce the Three Loathsome Eyes directly under the close scrutiny of the Holy Divine Palace, but he had not been investigated by the authorities. This in itself explained the problem.</p><p>When Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi entered the trap, he understood even more clearly that the Jiang clan had experienced the benefits of the Lei family’s Eyes and wanted more.</p><p>After all, a normal Faction, even a Demi-Saint Faction, wouldn’t dare to cross the Holy Divine Palace to look for forces that were related to the Lei family in the past.</p><p>This indirectly showed that.</p><p>The Jiang clan wanted and dared to take the Lei Family’s Eyes. They must have gained some benefits from the Lei family’s tragedy. Now that it had been so long and the matter had already passed, they wanted to make more profits.</p><p>But it was obvious…</p><p>Jiang Buyi didn’t expect that the Lei family’s incident was not over yet.</p><p>The two orphans of the Lei family had grown up under the care of different people other than the Saint Servant.</p><p>Under certain conditions, they even had the ability to influence and even counterattack their enemies from the past.</p><p>“You should be very rational now, right? You know that we can’t go looking for our enemies for the purpose of seeking revenge?” Xu Xiaoshou asked uncertainly.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Lei Xi’er ‘s eyebrows rose instead. “You mean, there are people from the Jiang Clan here?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
