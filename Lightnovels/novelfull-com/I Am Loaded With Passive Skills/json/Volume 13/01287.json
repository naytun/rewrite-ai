Please… strictly observe… Abyss Island… Order. Violators… Die!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er: “? ? ? ?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: “? ? ? ?”</p><p>Both their hearts skipped a beat. They could not believe what they had just heard.</p><p>The words that came from the Void Suppression Stele, coupled with the terrifying legend of the Abyss Island, made their hearts feel as if they were shrouded in a fog. They felt an inexplicable sense of panic.</p><p>Sinners…</p><p>Die…</p><p>“What kind of damned joke is this!”</p><p>After recovering from his daze, Xu Xiaoshou flew into a rage.</p><p>It was fine if there were no treasures, but this was still a stone stele with the names of criminals carved on it?</p><p>The panic that came after the warning issued by the Void Suppression Stele did not manage to suppress the fury in Xu Xiaoshou’s heart. If he had known earlier, he would have left his name on it. How could he let his Junior Sister take the risk?</p><p>“Bastard!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held the Fourth Sword and no longer suppressed it. He wanted to split open this broken stone stele with one stroke of the sword.</p><p>“What kind of rubbish name-leaving game is this?” He didn’t want to play anymore!</p><p>Perhaps touching this stone stele would really cause an accident, but he didn’t care anymore.</p><p>This place was so close to the big Bosses on the Inner Island, and he still had the Command Token that represented the Inner Island’s supreme twin Veins. What kind of waves could a mere Void Suppression Stele cause?</p><p>No matter how big it was, could it be bigger than Bazhun’an?</p><p>Moreover, if something really happened, the big Bosses’ Wills would be responsible for it!</p><p>So…</p><p>“I want to see what kind of treasure is hidden in this broken stone stele of yours!” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes shone with a fierce light. His Fourth Sword streaked through the air and slashed downward.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er had never expected Xu Xiaoshou to suddenly go crazy. She wanted to stop him, but it was already too late.</p><p>A patch of white mist instantly appeared in her left eye. In her God Devil Eyes, divine power burst forth and wrapped around Xu Xiaoshou’s body, in order to help him withstand any accidents that might happen next.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou only felt that his one thought had been enlightened, and all other distracting thoughts were discarded. There was even a surge of power pouring into his body, which caused his sword to become even more powerful.</p><p>“Xiu!”</p><p>Fourth Sword dropped down.</p><p>It struck the top of the Void Suppression Stele.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The Void exploded, and air currents surged.</p><p>But after this, not only did the Void Suppression Stele not crack, on the contrary, it actually withstood the Vicious Sword Fourth Sword’s attack.</p><p>“Keng!”</p><p>The Sword Body and the stone stele were equally matched. At the interface of the weapons, intense sparks were produced from the friction, and the Sword Will raged ferociously. Hidden Bitter’s sword body was even more frightened, and it bent toward Xu Xiaoshou’s neck.</p><p>“Wu Wu Wu…”</p><p>“You guys should stop fighting. If you want to fight, let me go first. I don’t want to be stuck in the middle of the battlefield!”</p><p>On the side, Lei Xi’er looked at this scene in shock.</p><p>“Fourth Sword was one of the Five Great Divine Instruments of Chaos. Even with Its honorific title, Vicious Sword, was actually not able to split open the Void Suppression Stele with a single sword strike?”</p><p>This truly came as a surprise to her.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou was not injured…”</p><p>The power of the God Devil Eyes was extremely strong. Even though they were separated by the turbulent space, the intense sparks, and the Sword Will that shot out in all directions, Lei Xi’er was still able to see the spot where the Sword Body and the stone stele came into contact. There was not even a mark left on it.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>After ten breaths of exchanging blows, Xu Xiaoshou, who had a strong ‘Toughness’, was unable to hold on any longer. He received all of the ‘Recoil’ force.</p><p>“Sizzle!” His palm was split open by the impact. Fourth Sword flew out in an inverted position and his eyes filled with shock.</p><p>“What kind of joke is this? I can’t even be compared to a piece of broken rock?”</p><p>After he removed the blood scab from his palm, Xu Xiaoshou looked at the new, tender flesh on his palm. He could not believe it.</p><p>The Void Suppression Stele was still good-tempered. Even if it pretended to be furious with his sword, it did not show any other abnormalities, much less attack.</p><p>But the power of that ‘Recoil’, his body could not withstand it?</p><p>“It’s so strong, it actually made me bleed.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou summoned back the Fourth Sword. He did not believe in its evil and continued to attack, using all kinds of moves.</p><p>“Keng Keng Keng Keng…”</p><p>“Bang Bang Bang…”</p><p>Time and time again, the Fourth Sword was sent flying. Xu Xiaoshou was injured and healed.</p><p>But the Void Suppression Stele was not damaged at all.</p><p>“You’re too weak! The Flame Python can leave its name, but you can’t even make a sword mark?” Xu Xiaoshou passed the buck to the Fourth Sword and scolded it seriously.</p><p>The Fourth Sword: “…”</p><p>It indicated that it did not want to speak and returned to this weak owner who could not even grasp a sword. It was speechless.</p><p>“It can’t be that bad, right?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was someone who knew what Xu Xiaoshou’s physical body strength was. If this guy really fought, his physical body alone would be able to withstand the Higher Void level, let alone having the Fourth Sword?</p><p>However, it was a fact that the Void Suppression Stele was unharmed…</p><p>“I’ll leave my name.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t believe it anymore.</p><p>If striking a stone didn’t work, leaving his name might work.</p><p>Perhaps the setting of the Void Suppression Stele was that it was impossible for you to hit me, but if you obediently left your name like a criminal, that would be within the rules.</p><p>After having scanned so many names on the Void Suppression Stele, Xu Xiaoshou was a little hesitant.</p><p>Soon, he nodded vehemently and came to the opposite side of the Void Suppression Stele.</p><p>There were three big words, “Abyss Island”, carved there. Other than that, there was nothing else.</p><p>Everyone was a person of quality. They all left their names on the back… Xu Xiaoshou sighed in his heart. They were not like me.</p><p>“I’m going to leave my name!”</p><p>He shouted at the Void Suppression Stele and used the Fourth Sword and pointed gently at the stone stele.</p><p>“Sizzle”</p><p>A shower of stone chips fell.</p><p>It was impossible to slash it, but it was really possible to leave a name!</p><p>“Strange.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er muttered and walked over, wanting to see if Xu Xiaoshou could make the stone stele lose its temper.</p><p>According to past experience, after he found out that he had been deceived, it was unlikely that Xu Xiaoshou would seriously leave his name.</p><p>After all, after the Trial Jade Pendant experience on the Yunlun Mountain range, the extremely long name ‘Xiao Wanfeng, come look for me quickly’ was still vivid in his mind.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
