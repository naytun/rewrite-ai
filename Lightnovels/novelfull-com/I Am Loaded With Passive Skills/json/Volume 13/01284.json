What Kind of Rubbish Are You? ! 2</p><p>She was completely speechless.</p><p>“What kind of operation was this?”</p><p>“The Inner Island of the Abyss Island and the Outer Island were two different worlds. Would the Holy Emperor let you summon him in this way?”</p><p>However…</p><p>“Command Token?”</p><p>She carefully examined the Command Token in Xu Xiaoshou’s hand. She was very curious about its function. Was it as great as Xu Xiaoshou said it was?</p><p>Strictly speaking, the reason why she and Lei Shuangxing were able to survive the destruction of the Lei Family that day was all thanks to Bazhun’an’s help during that time of crisis.</p><p>So, this was her savior’s Command Token?</p><p>“Do you like It? I’ll give it to you to play with.” Xu Xiaoshou did not care about it at all and threw the Command Token over.</p><p>Lei Xi’er quickly caught it. Her beautiful eyes turned sideways and she cast Xu Xiaoshou a look of reproach.</p><p>However, she could not help being curious about it. After she received the Command Token, she flipped it over and instantly saw the image of the naked woman on the back. Her hands were clasped to her knees and she seemed to be weeping softly. Her four limbs were shackled and extended beyond the boundary of the Command Token.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was a little stunned. When she looked at the carved image, she felt that this woman was as beautiful as a celestial being. She could not help but feel pity for her.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at her, shook his head and sighed. “In the past, I was just like you. I naively thought that this was the faith of a Saint Servant. He carved a beautiful statue and said, “If you don’t become a Saint, you will become a slave, then everyone would be loyal to Bazhun’an.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was stunned. Wasn’t that the case?</p><p>“Then what about now?”</p><p>“Now…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of what the big mouth of Fringe Moon Immortal City had said and laughed. “Maybe this is Bazhun’an’s old lover. That’s all.”</p><p>“Bazhun’an?” Lei Xi’er was dumbfounded.</p><p>“Suspected, passive points + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw that his Junior Sister’s demeanor had changed. When she heard this, her eyes lit up when she heard the burning gossip from the past. He immediately smiled and said,</p><p>“Yue Gongnu, I heard that she was the top beauty on the Peerless Beauty list. It’s a pity that I haven’t seen her in person.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s delicate hand that was holding the Command Token trembled as soon as she said those words. Xu Xiaoshou had also keenly sensed that something was wrong and was immediately stunned.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry…”</p><p>“Take no offence at this child’s babbling, take no offence at this child’s babbling!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er immediately clasped her hands together and bowed in all directions.</p><p>“Good heavens, she was an old aunty during Bazhun’an’s era. To be able to become Bazhun’an’s … Bah! … ptui! Dao companion, she should be a Demi-Saint right now, right?”</p><p>“If I call out this holy name directly, will something happen to me?”</p><p>“Aunty, we’re on the same side! We’re on the same side!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cowered in embarrassment. He was so nervous that he was about to die. He knew that he had been a little too presumptuous just now.</p><p>Abyss Island was a dangerous place to begin with, and he still dared to call out the holy name so indiscriminately…</p><p>How could he dare to court death like this!</p><p>“Cursed, passive points + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er clearly understood this as well and rolled her eyes at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>However, when she saw that nothing untoward happened, she heaved a sigh of relief and handed the Command Token back. She snapped, “Watch your mouth. When you’re about to die, you’ll definitely die by your unrestrained mouth.”</p><p>“You don’t want it?” Xu Xiaoshou shook the Command Token in his hand.</p><p>“This is something that the Eighth Sword Deity gave you. I won’t take it. Take good care of it.”</p><p>“That’s a pity. I was thinking that I would say that I lost this Command Token and ask for another from Bazhun’an in the future. No matter what, it can be considered a Protective Talisman.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er: “…”</p><p>“Received a supercilious look. Passive points + 1.”</p><p>“You really don’t want it?”</p><p>“There’s no need. Keep it well.”</p><p>“Forget it. When I become famous in the future, I’ll make another Protective Talisman for you.” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t insist and kept the Four Pillars of Destiny token.</p><p>This was a good thing. If it was on Abyss Island, it might be able to display combat strength that far surpassed a Demi-Saint’s.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was very clear how powerful this ‘face fruit’ was!</p><p>..</p><p>The cognitive discussion on the Abyss Island came to an end.</p><p>Lei Xi’er didn’t dare to be as outstanding as Xu Xiaoshou. At this moment, she began to study the huge stone stele in front of her.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, come here.” Not long after, she waved her hand.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Did you find something?” Xu Xiaoshou was still using his ‘Perception’ to find a path for his future with his two swords in hand. When he heard her call, he ran over eagerly.</p><p>His original intention was to follow the guidance of the Flame Python and abandon all the things that were a waste of time in order to look for the treasure that the Great Infernal Ancestor might have left for him.</p><p>However, Lei Xi’er’s obsessive-compulsive disorder and curiosity were clearly stronger than his. She insisted on studying the disgusting, slippery stone stele that was covered in dust and moss.</p><p>“There’s an indentation. It seems to be a word?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er did not dare to touch it. She only voiced out what she had discovered.</p><p>“Word?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at it and said nonchalantly, “It’s a word.”</p><p>“Looking at the thick moss, this stone stele probably had not been touched for thousands of years. It’s definitely not a treasure.”</p><p>“It’s not as if no one had ever been to this Abyss Island before. Bazhun’an knows the goods. If this stone stele was a treasure, he would have studied it thoroughly long ago. How could it be covered with moss?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er did not say anything.</p><p>What Xu Xiaoshou said sounded reasonable.</p><p>However, he said this only because his knowledge was shallow.</p><p>“Do you still remember what I said earlier about the ‘Void Suppression Stele’?” Lei Xi’er asked.</p><p>“Oh ho, you mean this thing?” This time, Xu Xiaoshou’s interest was piqued. He leaned over and looked at it carefully. However, he soon frowned. “What’s the use of a Void Suppression Stele? If it was a treasure, it would have been taken away long ago, right?”</p><p>“It’s not a treasure. The Void Suppression Stele represents the entrance to the Abyss Island. There are many pieces…”</p><p>“Tsk.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou instantly lost interest.</p><p>Many meant miscellaneous and not valuable.</p><p>The rarer the item, the more valuable it was. No wonder there was so much moss on this broken stone stele.</p><p>He figured that it might be dangerous to touch it because so many people had been to the Abyss Island, but none of them wanted to touch it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
