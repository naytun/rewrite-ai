Finally, she saw his face clearly. Her words held a touch of incredulity.</p><p>“How did Situ Yongren fall into Huang Quan’s hands?”</p><p>“Sword.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the Cang Godhood Sword with a smile.</p><p>Every time he used an impossible deal to persecute someone, he was very happy because the other party’s entanglement could bring him a large number of passive points.</p><p>Similarly, a variety of expressions that he had never seen before were filled with surprise.</p><p>“Huang Quan, do you know what you are doing?!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was infuriated by Huang Quan’s audacity.</p><p>“How could this person be so greedy and covert the mysterious Cang Godhood Sword? Did he not know that it was impossible to trade this sword?!”</p><p>At that moment, she pointed at Situ Yongren and said angrily, “The person in your hand is Dao Qiong…”</p><p>Before she could finish her words, Situ Yongren suddenly raised his eyes and interrupted her loudly, “Don’t say it!”</p><p>Calling the Supreme Master by his name could indeed make the Supreme Master pay attention to this place.</p><p>But just now, Situ Yongren had already promised that he would not choose this method to ease his way through.</p><p>If he were to go back on his words with the help of others while he was still in Huang Quan’s hands, who knew what Huang Quan would do to him in a fit of rage!</p><p>Most importantly…</p><p>Situ Yongren himself also knew very well that his value was far less than the Xuan Cang Godhood Sword.</p><p>Therefore, this transaction was absolutely impossible to complete. After that, he would still be in Huang Quan’s hands!</p><p>Naturally, he could only lie low for now.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was stopped by her own people. Her expression froze, but she realized that this should be some kind of transaction between Situ and Huang Quan. She immediately stopped talking.</p><p>“Peng Peng Peng…”</p><p>“Peng Peng Peng…”</p><p>The Holy Emperor Dragon Scale struck rapidly once again. The clingy Spirit was about to appear again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t have time to engage in idle talk with Rao Yaoyao and the others. He patted Situ Yongren’s face and turned his head:</p><p>“It’s time for your show.”</p><p>“Remember, you only have time to say one sentence. If you talk too much, that guy behind will come and take your life.”</p><p>Situ Yongren’s body trembled.</p><p>He didn’t know why Huang Quan would not let him down. He insisted on carrying him and making him talk to the seniors of the Holy Divine Palace and the Holy Palace and the Higher Void level in such a shameful manner.</p><p>But obviously…</p><p>The Demi-Saint behind him was even more terrifying!</p><p>“Sword Deity Rao!”</p><p>Situ Yongren pushed back his hair and opened his eyes wide. He announced loudly, “I’m Situ. I’m not being coerced. But right now, I have something important to report to you!”</p><p>He looked back in a panic. Seeing that the Demi-Saint hadn’t caught up, Situ Yongren started to shout:</p><p>“Pu Xuan of the Jiang clan in the Northern Region! Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi. Plotting for the position of Holy Emperor!”!</p><p>“He crossed the Holy Divine Palace and attacked without permission. Now he has come to the Eastern Region and is still following me. He wants to… kill me to silence me! ! !”</p><p>His voice was loud.</p><p>It spread far and wide.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao, Teng Shanhai, Ye Xiao: “? ? ?”</p><p>Mu Ling, Bai Lian: “? ? ?”</p><p>Higher Void Level : “?”</p><p>No one had the time to question him.</p><p>Amid the sounds of the loud heartbeat of the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale, Jiang Buyi’s Demi-Saint incarnation, who had suddenly barged into everyone’s line of sight, collided head-on with Situ Yongren’s crazy outpouring of his dirty deeds in public. Following that, Rao Yaoyao’s incredulous gaze turned into one that was about to devour someone…</p><p>“? ? ?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s head expanded into two.</p><p>On one side, Xu Xiaoshou silently moved aside so Rao Yaoyao could see the Demi-Saint’s face more clearly. Hidden under his mask, there was an outline of a meaningful smile at the corners of his mouth.</p><p>Demi-Saint’s extermination.</p><p>This matter was a resounding success!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
