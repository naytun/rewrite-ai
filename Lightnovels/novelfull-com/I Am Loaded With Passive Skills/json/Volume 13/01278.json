What could it be?</p><p>10 seconds…</p><p>30 seconds…</p><p>60 seconds…</p><p>Saint Punishment Pillar didn’t plan to stop draining his energy out!</p><p>A large amount of energy dazzled the path patterns on Saint Punishment Square.</p><p>Gu Qingyi couldn’t feel any power threatening him, which meant the strange movements of Saint Punishment Square were coming for Yu Lingdi but not an outsider like him.</p><p>“Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s blood flowed from his body to Saint Punishment Pillar.</p><p>“Too bad for him.”</p><p>Gu Qingyi looked at this scene but couldn’t do anything.</p><p>After a while, he finally felt a sense of familiarity.</p><p>The way Saint Punishment Pillar absorbed energy was very similar to how water balls sucked Spiritual Cultivators’ spiritual source in Deep Sea World?</p><p>Gu Qingyi had been to Deep Sea World, so he had experienced the process of the spiritual draw.</p><p>He was a pure ancient swordsman, which was why there was not much spiritual source in his energy reverse that could be drawn out. Therefore, he began to lose his life energy almost right after the water ball appeared.</p><p>However, after mastering Swordless Sword Technique, Gu Qingyi quickly broke through the difficult situation in Deep Sea World and finally found the ancient door connecting to Abyss Island at the bottom..</p><p>“Void gate?”</p><p>Thinking of the ancient gate, Gu Qingyi thought that he had the answer.</p><p>At this moment, since the ancient door in Deep Sea World had led him to Abyss Island, it was a void gate.</p><p>Opening a void gate required a sacrifice and a large amount of energy.</p><p>Did water balls absorb the spiritual source of Spiritual Cultivators in Deep Sea World to open the void gate?</p><p>“I understand!”</p><p>Gu Qingyi finally understood.</p><p>The void door in the outside world needed energy to be opened so it could connect to Abyss Island and send people in.</p><p>In that case, there had to be an energy-receiving point in Abyss Island to connect to the void door at the bottom of Deep Sea World and create a two-way… spatial passageway?</p><p>“In other words, Yu Lingdi is… this side of the spatial passageway’s sacrifice?”</p><p>Gu Qingyi widened his eyes, and his lips were quivering.</p><p>Bazhun’an had found Yu Lingdi here, forced him to Saint Punishment Square, and tied him to Saint Punishment Pillar to use Yu Lingdi’s majestic spiritual source, which was at the peak of the Sovereign Dao Realm, to create the deep-sea gate of the void. Like this, it would be easier to send people to Abyss Island, right?</p><p>This was too cruel!</p><p>Gu Qingyi couldn’t believe what was on his mind.</p><p>At this point, not only did he not fully clear his doubts, he was even more confused.</p><p>Why had Yu Lingdi entered Abyss Island in advance?</p><p>How had Bazhun’an known that Yu Lingdi was here?</p><p>Fulfilling the Dao realm, Water-type Upanishad, and an enormous spiritual source… Yu Lingdi was the perfect target as someone under the demi-saint realm and the best sacrifice in the spatial passageway… Was it a coincidence or an accident?</p><p>“A trap?</p><p>“No! Impossible!”</p><p>“This must be a coincidence!”</p><p>On the other side, Gu Qingyi still doubted if such a chance existed.</p><p>Yu Lingdi was still on Saint Punishment Pillar and couldn’t hold on any longer.</p><p>“Uhg, uhg, uhg…”</p><p>“Lea… leave…”</p><p>“Find… Rao Yaoyao…”</p><p>“Send… information… Thank you…”</p><p>He was still struggling!</p><p>Gu Qingyi was speechless.</p><p>How strong Yu Lingdi was.</p><p>After thinking about how pathetic Yu Lingdi was, Gu Qingyi planned to leave.</p><p>He was afraid that after Saint Punishment Pillar sucked out Yu Lingdi, it would send its holy power and take him down before slapping him.</p><p>That situation was about to go completely out of control!</p><p>Carrying the gravity, Gu Qingyi started to run.</p><p>He kept turning back and thinking.</p><p>As Spirit Division Chief, wouldn’t it be… too pathetic if Yu Lingdi died like this?</p><p>At this moment, there was a subtle Phenomenon in the distant sky, which drew Gu Qingyi’s attention.</p><p>“There is Phenomenon again?”</p><p>Every time Yu Lingdi trembled, the sky would have a strange change.</p><p>Gu Qingyi didn’t know if the distance made the Phenomenon seem to be very subtle or if it was like this all the time.</p><p>He figured out the connection between Yu Lingdi’s abnormal reaction and the void gate, so he knew what the meaning behind the Phenomenon was.</p><p>“Yu Lingdi was able to survive after trembling for a few seconds… It means that the void gate in Deep Sea World was pushed open, but not many people came in. Maybe there was only one?”</p><p>Gu Qingyi looked back and saw Yu Lingdi, who didn’t want to die just like that, was still struggling desperately.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
