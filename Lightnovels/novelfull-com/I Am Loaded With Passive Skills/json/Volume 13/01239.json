Of course, Situ Yongren knew it better than anyone else. He was just playing dumb now.</p><p>Anyway, it was rare for him to be muddle-headed!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou remained the same expression and spoke again.</p><p>“The demi-saint of the Jiang Clan will understand your choice if he sees you walking the same path as me.”</p><p>“He will not care whether your choice is active or passive. He will not care about your supreme master’s reputation as well. It is because you already know about his plan,” he continued.</p><p>“By then, you might already be a dead man before you could convey the message.”</p><p>“Do you understand that?”</p><p>Situ Yongren kept looking around. Even though he could not see anyone around, the strange feeling made him feel a chill down his spine.</p><p>He nodded vigorously. He seemed to be choked with sobs too.</p><p>“I am not stupid too, Elder…”</p><p>“There is only one way for me now!”</p><p>Poor kid!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought it in his mind. Perhaps, Situ Yongren’s hatred toward Lord Huang Quan was greater than his hatred toward the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan now. Just that he did not show it on his face.</p><p>But all these…</p><p>Was targeting Huang Quan. It had absolutely nothing to do with the Saint Servant, Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“Alright!” he nodded hard. “Since you wish to do so, I will bring you along and save your life then.”</p><p>Situ Yongren’s eyes lit up instantly as he said, “Thank you, Elder!”</p><p>He took a step forward and was about to hang onto the body of Lord Huang Quan and teleported with him.</p><p>However, when he reached out his hand, he found that the man with the golden mask was still acting indifferently.</p><p>Situ Yongren was stunned.</p><p>“Elder, what are you waiting for? Why aren’t you leaving yet?”</p><p>Was he waiting for death to arrive?</p><p>“Take me away from here immediately!”</p><p>Situ Yongren was about to be out of his mind.</p><p>“Wait a moment.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said calmly. However, a hint of craziness flashed through his eyes.</p><p>What one heard was false, but what one saw was true.</p><p>Until now, Situ Yongren learned about all the plans of the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan through Lord Huang Quan’s words.</p><p>In such a critical situation, of course, he would choose to agree with Lord Huang Quan.</p><p>But once he managed to escape from here, would he still take it seriously?</p><p>Situ Yongren said that he wanted to make a contribution. But, after interacting with him, Xu Xiaoshou found that he was not a good person too. He was full of bad ideas and smart too.</p><p>Therefore, he had to let Situ Yongren see the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan in person!</p><p>As long as the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan saw him, he would be able to recognize him.</p><p>Without further conversation, Situ Yongren would acknowledge all the psychological hints such as “the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan intended to overthrow the Lei Family’s tragedy”, “the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan is plotting against the authority of the Lei Family”, “The demi-saint of the Jiang Clan had crossed the line and set their eyes on the throne and also some other benefits”, etc… that he had conveyed to him subconsciously.</p><p>All these crimes were many times more serious than “the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan had set their eyes on Lei Family’s Eyes”.</p><p>The latter was just an act of an individual.</p><p>However, the former was a monstrous plot of the demi-saint family!</p><p>As long as Situ Yongren survived the disaster, he would report all these plots to the headquarter of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>The latter, which only cast greedy eyes on the Lei Family’s Eyes, might not be enough to set the alarm at the higher management.</p><p>But the former charges were absolutely different…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou believed that the Jiang Clan of Pu Xuan in the Northern Region was about to meet their doom!</p><p>The mission that Water Ghost assigned to Xu Xiaoshou was to lure the demi-saint into the deep water and followed by sacrilege. Of course, the best outcome was the death of demi-saints.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou did not seem to be satisfied with all these.</p><p>This matter was somehow related to his junior and the Lei Family’s Eyes.</p><p>If he did not get rid of this harm, he would still have to face endless trouble in the future.</p><p>Since he had encountered someone from the Holy Divine Palace, Situ Yongren, he could make use of him to get rid of an adversary.</p><p>He could use the Holy Divine Palace’s might to get rid of the entire Jiang Clan of Pu Xuan in the Northern Region completely!</p><p>“Thump! Thump!”</p><p>“Thump! Thump!”</p><p>“Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump!”</p><p>Three of them were having their hearts pumping fast at that moment.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suppressed the fear of meeting a demi-saint in him as he set his eyes in the direction above him. Without turning around, he asked, “You could recognize the face and the aura of the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan, right?”</p><p>Gulp!</p><p>Situ Yongren swallowed hard. His face turned pale all of a sudden.</p><p>He understood what Lord Huang Quan was up to now. Hence, he replied, “Of course, I could recognize him.”</p><p>“Don’t worry. I will not lie to you.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around and grinned. There were fears in the eyes under the golden mask. However, he said gently, “If you follow what I say, the information you obtained this time will definitely help you in obtaining anything you want!”</p><p>“Gulp!”</p><p>Situ Yongren swallowed hard again. However, it was not fear this time but envy.</p><p>He nodded vigorously and said, “I understand.”</p><p>Lord Huang Quan of Yama intended to make use of the Holy Divine Palace to get rid of the Jiang Clan of Pu Xuan in the Northern Region. Situ Yongren had only one choice now, which is to be forced to become the medium to kill out of desperation.</p><p>Of course, forcing someone to do something was never comparable to having someone in doing something willingly.</p><p>As the saying went, the achievement of a general cost many lives. Since it was his destiny to walk on this path, he would dare to make use of the Holy Divine Palace to achieve his success.</p><p>As long as what Lord Huang Quan said was true… No! As long as 30 percent of them were true!</p><p>Later, he, Situ Yongren could make use of the statement “the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan had an intention to ascend to the throne of the Holy Emperor” to get rid of the Jiang Clan.</p><p>Then, he could take down the position of the Path Division Chief with the help of such great merit.</p><p>In fact, he could even make more profits out of it.</p><p>Of course…</p><p>When it came to such a situation, the “truth” was no longer important anymore.</p><p>In Situ Yongren’s eyes, he had nowhere else to go now. It would be either the death of the demi-saint of the Jiang Clan or himself.</p><p>As long as the person he saw later was a demi-saint of the Jiang Clan in person.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
