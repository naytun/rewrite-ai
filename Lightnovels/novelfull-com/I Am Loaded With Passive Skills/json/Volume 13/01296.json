Although Ice and Ember were driving side by side, it was more than enough.</p><p>Not to mention others, just having Ice and Ember on the road, the strange gravity on Abyss Island could basically be ignored.</p><p>The only possible risk was…</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, is this really fine?”</p><p>On the ice blue White Skeleton’s head of Ice, Lei Xi’er asked worriedly.</p><p>She always felt that Abyss Island was such a dangerous place. Using these two giants to rush around recklessly would cause such a loud sound.</p><p>Was this not afraid of death?</p><p>What if all the dangers in various places were attracted by the sound of rushing and came over? What should they do then?</p><p>“I’m not afraid.”</p><p>On Ember’s head, Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand and didn’t care at all.</p><p>“A real man should be brave enough to fight. There are so many opportunities on Abyss Island. It’s too much of a waste of time to search for them one by one.</p><p>“It has been said that opportunities come with risks. In other words, It’s equivalent to danger being an opportunity.</p><p>“As we travel, we summon opportunities. Maybe we can break through faster!”</p><p>That would mean dying even faster… Lei Xi’er had no strength to retort.</p><p>But seeing Xu Xiaoshou’s fearless attitude, she could not say much.</p><p>After all, in her impression, Xu Xiaoshou was not a person who was brave enough to die. On the contrary, he cherished his life very much. Since he dared to do this, he would definitely have a backup plan.</p><p>“Hehe! We won’t die.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at Lei Xi’er who was on Ice’s head and smiled as he took out a piece of Holy Emperor Dragon Scale.</p><p>“This thing contains the will of the Holy Emperor. It can be said to be a risk-sensing device.</p><p>“What I’m giving it now is not only the intention to avoid danger, but also to pursue the opportunity.</p><p>“Unfortunately, both of them are pointing in this direction.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pointed to the front as he spoke.</p><p>This direction was where the strange sound broke out in the distance while the two of them were pondering in front of the stele. It was the route from the ancient city’s construction zone to the forest zone in the suburbs.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was very relieved about the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale.</p><p>Water Ghost’s words had been verified. The Holy Emperor Dragon Scale could even sense the risk of a demi-saint chasing after him. With this thing, what was he afraid of?</p><p>The Jiang Clan demi-saint was the only one on Abyss Island. As long as they came close, the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale would notify him.</p><p>Thus there would be no problem with rushing around recklessly!</p><p>If there was still a problem, he could just run away. If not, everyone would be put into the Yuan Mansion. He could use the vanishing technique himself… Xu Xiaoshou had a trump card.</p><p>He expected that with such a huge opportunity on Abyss Island, no one would be foolish enough to wait on the spot when they could not find it.</p><p>And since he had the trump card that could save his life, he could afford to act a little unbridled when he made a move.</p><p>“Thump! Thump…”</p><p>“Thump! Thump…”</p><p>Ice and Ember continued to run happily releasing their nature that had long been suppressed. Suddenly, a faint heartbeat sound from the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale sounded in Xu Xiaoshou’s hand.</p><p>Lei Xi’er was always on alert. When she noticed the abnormality of the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale, her brows also twitched. “What does this mean?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou instantly tightened his grip on the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale.</p><p>The sudden sound of the heartbeat alerted him.</p><p>However, this heartbeat was very slow and steady. It was not like the demi-saint Jiang Buyi’s suppressed and high-frequency rapid heartbeat that made one’s head explode before showing up.</p><p>Therefore…</p><p>“There’s danger, but not big,” Xu Xiaoshou said.</p><p>Lei Xi’er was silent.</p><p>She kept feeling unsure.</p><p>Was this tiny dragon scale reliable?</p><p>“Received Concern, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>After a while, at the end of the road, the sound that had remained steady in rhythm disappeared. Xu Xiaoshou immediately raised his hand and stopped Ice and Ember from running frantically.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>The two White Skeleton giants stopped moving when they heard him, and the chaotic noise in their ears disappeared.</p><p>The sudden silence highlighted how stuck the Void Suppression Stele in Ember’s hand was.</p><p>“Honk! Honk! Honk! Honk! Honk…”</p><p>A few of them could not help but look at the Void Suppression Stele at the same time.</p><p>Until now, the Void Suppression Stele had not recovered from its downtime.</p><p>But that was not important…</p><p>“Anything wrong?” Lei Xi’er glanced at the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale and shifted her gaze to the front.</p><p>“No…” Xu Xiaoshou shook his head slightly.</p><p>The heartbeat of the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale did not become heavier or faster. This meant that the risk ahead was still constant and within a controllable range.</p><p>What he was curious about was why the “bang” sound that was extremely similar to the White Skeleton giant’s sound of running stopped.</p><p>The wind rustled, accompanied by the strange cries of the goose. There was a faintly somber atmosphere.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but look around the surroundings.</p><p>They had already left the ancient city’s construction zone and arrived at the forest zone in the suburbs.</p><p>The ancient trees around them were towering, and each of them was several thousand feet tall. They were even taller than Ice and Ember. They were incomparably huge, perfectly blocking one’s line of sight.</p><p>It was undoubtedly a perfect battlefield for a wood attribute Spiritual Cultivator.</p><p>The forest was lush, and there was a faint medicinal fragrance…</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sniffed, feeling refreshed.</p><p>This medicinal fragrance…</p><p>Could it be that the so-called opportunity was the ancient medicine on Abyss Island?</p><p>This was great news!</p><p>Right now, he was most in need of high-quality spiritual ingredients. Perhaps eating an ancient medicine here could push his cultivation level up rapidly!</p><p>“Gulp…”</p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Xiaoshou could not help but swallow his saliva.</p><p>At this moment, the heartbeat of the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale increased slightly, and his pupils constricted.</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Before he could find out the reason, the sky suddenly darkened.</p><p>In the next second, there was the sound of an explosion in the distance. Smoke and dust filled the air.</p><p>Lei Xi’er instantly tensed up. She looked up, and her God Devil Eyes began to spin rapidly.</p><p>Without a doubt, the opportunity or danger… was coming!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also looked in that direction.</p><p>Perception could clearly analyze the scene in the smoke and dust that was not visible to the naked eye.</p><p>It was a black object that was as huge as a pillar falling from the sky. It looked like something had fallen from the clouds. The shape of its bottom was like a foot which had five forks. Its scientific name was a toe.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>A toe?</p><p>Forget about the toe, why did it even have a fingernail?</p><p>This, could it be a real foot?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face turned pale.</p><p>In the dust, as the incomparably huge foot solidified, the connecting calves, thighs, and whole body on the foot also converged into the real form from the illusory state.</p><p>It was a giant!</p><p>A super giant that first stepped through space with a foot and then brought its whole body over!</p><p>“F*ck! It’s so huge!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets when he saw this. The corners of his lips twitched.</p><p>Ice and Ember were already big enough. But a height of 1500 feet was like a dwarf in front of this new super giant, only reaching its waist!</p><p>“This is definitely more than 3000 feet, right?</p><p>“F*ck… It’s a thousand, thousand-meter tall giant?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou placed his hand on his forehead and sucked in a cold breath.</p><p>“Honk! Honk! Honk! Honk! Honk…”</p><p>“Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump…”</p><p>The sound of the Void Suppression Stele’s goose and the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale’s heartbeat continued in an orderly manner.</p><p>On the side, Lei Xi’er had clearly seen the super giant’s true form. And her God Devil Eyes stopped spinning.</p><p>“Void, void attendant?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned his head when he heard this and asked in disbelief, “Void attendant? This thing is the void attendant you were talking about?”</p><p>“It should be…”</p><p>“How is this an ‘attendant’? It should be called ‘void general’, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was on the verge of a breakdown.</p><p>Such a huge void attendant… He had originally thought that “attendant” meant a guard or a cute maid. Who would have thought that “attendant” to be so huge?</p><p>However, everything on Abyss Island was so huge.</p><p>It seemed that it was normal for the void attendant to be a little bigger.</p><p>“F*ck…”</p><p>This was not normal at all!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried his best to calm himself down. However, he was unable to calm down his fear of giant objects.</p><p>He stared blankly at the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale that had only sped up a little but still maintained a steady heartbeat rhythm…</p><p>“This thing is quite useful. I shouldn’t have sensed it wrongly, right?</p><p>“In other words, the arrival of the void attendant might not be hostile?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er muttered.</p><p>Hopefully so.</p><p>Just as she was thinking, the void attendant that was several times larger than the White Skeleton giant opened its mouth.</p><p>“Sinner… Lei Xi’er…”</p><p>“Sinner… receive from god… receive from god… receive from god…eh?”</p><p>It suddenly stuck, causing Xu Xiaoshou to feel delighted. He thought to himself if he successfully defeated the void attendant just like that. As expected, he had to rely on magic!</p><p>The next second.</p><p>The void attendant, who was not as rigid as the Void Suppression Stele, knew how to change the concept and hummed.</p><p>“Sinner number 152384…</p><p>“Also, sinner number 800820…</p><p>“Please atone for your sins and perform meritorious deeds. Accept the void mission to clear the intruders from Abyss Island. Mission reward–Void Crystal.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
