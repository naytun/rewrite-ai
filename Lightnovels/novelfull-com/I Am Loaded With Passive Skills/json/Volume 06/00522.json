His eyes immediately turned cold.</p><p>“Looks like you guys really don’t know what’s good for you.”</p><p>He raised his hand and the ground suddenly began to tremble.</p><p>The sand and stones bounced and then cracked, turning into white sword qi.</p><p>“Pa Pa…”</p><p>In an instant, the sword intent that filled the sky pressed down on the ground.</p><p>This time, all the unnecessary words stopped abruptly.</p><p>“Innate Sword Intent?”</p><p>Su Qianqian’s eyes flashed with surprise.</p><p>This scene was extremely interesting to her.</p><p>It was one thing to pretend to be Brother Xiaoshou, but this person actually had Innate Sword Intent?</p><p>However, to be able to do this…</p><p>Why didn’t he recognize Brother Xiaoshou himself?</p><p>Everyone once again looked at Xu Xiaoshou in unison.</p><p>Even Rao Yinyin had taken a back seat at this moment, focusing all the flashlights on the young man in front of her.</p><p>“Heh, you still say that you’re not the leader?”</p><p>The black-robed Xu Xiaoshou snorted coldly and pointed with his finger. Sword of the Void intent swept in all directions. “I’ll give you another chance. Scram, or die?”</p><p>“Threatened. Passive value, + 1.”</p><p>“Yoo-hoo.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was so angry that he was amused.</p><p>It was fine to pretend to be me, which meant that I was very popular.</p><p>But I, Xu Xiaoshou, don’t seem to have ever been so arrogant before!</p><p>You’re ruining my reputation like this. If word of this gets out, how am I going to live my life?</p><p>Isn’t this making enemies for no reason?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, right?” He asked.</p><p>“That’s right!” The other person raised his chin.</p><p>“If you’re Xu Xiaoshou, do you know who I am?”</p><p>“You?”</p><p>The black-robed Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. “You’re just an ant. I, Xu Xiaoshou, have no interest in knowing your name.”</p><p>“What about her?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pointed and said in a soft voice, then looked around. “What about them? You’re not interested in knowing?”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>The black-robed Xu Xiaoshou roared furiously, and the air suddenly trembled. “You don’t want to leave without seeing the famous sword, right?”</p><p>“So powerful. How did you do it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou asked curiously.</p><p>When he saw that this fellow wasn’t angry or worried, he immediately thought of ‘Swallow the Mountains and Rivers’.</p><p>But the key point was that the opponent was a fake!</p><p>It was impossible for him to have ‘Swallow the Mountains and Rivers’.</p><p>So, this was also a fake spiritual technique?</p><p>But it seemed like this was the first time that his “Swallow the Mountains and Rivers” had appeared against Tan Ji!</p><p>What was going on..</p><p>“So much nonsense. If you want to die, just say it. Why do you have to circle around?”</p><p>Black-robed Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand. “Go!”</p><p>The people behind him were not afraid at all. They directly exploded the spiritual mist and pounced forward.</p><p>This group of people who looked like little lambs had already encountered them many times in the White Cave.</p><p>Disciples of the Tiansang Spirit Palace?</p><p>Heh, their appearance was indeed very bright!</p><p>However, a fledgling was still a fledgling. No matter how gorgeous their appearance was or how weak they were, they still could not escape the ferocious jaws of the wolf pack.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The black shadows in the storefront instantly rushed over, and the Tiansang Spirit Palace team looked as if they were facing a great enemy.</p><p>“Hold on.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly raised his hand and shouted.</p><p>This shout caused not only the hearts of the black-robed people on the opposite side to suddenly thump.</p><p>Even the Tiansang Spirit Palace team and the people on their side felt their hearts skip a beat.</p><p>The rising sky’s killing intent froze, and everyone stopped in their tracks.</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was pleasantly surprised.</p><p>The one-time mood change of “Swallow the Mountains and Rivers” actually had such a magical effect?</p><p>If this was to suddenly explode in the middle of a battle, wouldn’t it be able to directly cause one to die on the spot?</p><p>“Interrupting divine skill, this is…”</p><p>As he thought about it, he suddenly forgot to continue speaking.</p><p>“What are you trying to… be noisy about again?”</p><p>The black-robed Xu Xiaoshou was also extremely uncomfortable from this shout.</p><p>However, the youth opposite him did not seem to be simple. He waved his hand and dismissed his own people.</p><p>“It’s nothing. I’m just returning the favor.” Xu Xiaoshou came back to his senses.</p><p>“You’ve introduced yourself. Logically speaking, I should also introduce myself. This is a polite greeting from both sides.”</p><p>“But I’m really not the leader.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded sincerely. He pointed at Rao Yinyin and said, “She is.”</p><p>Rao Yinyin: ? ? ?</p><p>“Suspected. Passive value, + 1.”</p><p>“Do you know who she is?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t wait for the others to speak and continued, “This is the handsome and charming senior sister from the Tiansang Spirit Palace, Rao Yinyin.”</p><p>“This is!”</p><p>He pointed at Su Qianqian and said, “She is the beautiful and talented junior from the outer court, Su Qianqian.”</p><p>“And this one!”</p><p>He pointed at Mu Zixi again and opened his mouth.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, do you have any sense of shame?” Mu Zixi’s face was as black as charcoal.</p><p>“Ahem.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou coughed twice and ignored him. He continued, “This one has the surname Mu and is called Charcoal.”</p><p>Mu Zixi: ? ? ?</p><p>“Cursed, passive value, + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>Everyone laughed when they heard this.</p><p>Even the people from the Tiansang Spirit Palace who were originally not on good terms with each other became interested under the influence of external forces.</p><p>This real and fake Xu Xiaoshou..</p><p>Interesting!</p><p>Really Interesting!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Although Mu Zixi’s voice was low, the black-robed Xu Xiaoshou also heard it.</p><p>“Boss, this…”</p><p>The black-robed second brother who had just introduced the black-robed Xu Xiaoshou suddenly became anxious. He turned his body to the side and wanted to communicate with him.</p><p>“Hahahaha!”</p><p>Suddenly, the black-robed boss threw his head back and laughed loudly. It was as if he was about to burst into tears.</p><p>“?” The black-robed second brother.</p><p>Even an intimate person like him did not understand the meaning of this action.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“What a good Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>The black-robed boss said angrily, “In front of me, Xu Xiaoshou, you are the twenty-seventh person who dares to pretend to be Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“As for your tacit cooperation…”</p><p>He glanced at people like Mu Zixi and nodded.</p><p>“I admit that you are very strong!”</p><p>“At least, among these twenty-seven people, you are the one who pretended to be the best.”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>Before the black-robed boss finished speaking, Xu Xiaoshou skillfully interrupted him.</p><p>“Are you mistaken? I’m not pretending to be Xu Xiaoshou, okay? I also feel that I’m not worthy of Xu Xiaoshou’s outstanding and heroic image.”</p><p>“Don’t talk nonsense. I’m not pretending. Xu Xiaoshou is too great. I’m not worthy.”</p><p>Black Robe: “…”</p><p>He reached out his hand and his lips trembled a few times. Suddenly, he did not know what to say.</p><p>This guy, why didn’t he act according to common sense?</p><p>He kept praising and did not repeat himself.</p><p>How did you come up with so many words to describe Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>If he had not seen Xu Xiaoshou’s portrait, Black Robe would have almost been fooled by the fake Xu Xiaoshou No. 2.</p><p>This guy did not mention “I am Xu Xiaoshou” at all.</p><p>But his words and actions.</p><p>Resembled!</p><p>Really resembled!</p><p>Strong.</p><p>Really strong!</p><p>“Little brat, don’t think that you can escape this disaster just because you flatter me.”</p><p>Black-robed Xu Xiaoshou was uncertain and suddenly did not want to say anything more. “Go, destroy them!”</p><p>Even though the other party was pretending as well.</p><p>But since she knew that it wasn’t the case, then that was right.</p><p>And as long as it wasn’t Xu Xiaoshou, how could those small fries who didn’t even have a Grandmaster cultivation block the firepower that she had specially gathered?</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Under the command, everyone charged forward once again.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately shouted again.</p><p>At this moment, everyone’s hearts jumped again.</p><p>The first time could be an illusion.</p><p>However, if the second time was the same, then it wouldn’t make sense.</p><p>“Boss?”</p><p>“This guy doesn’t seem right. How about…”</p><p>The black-robed second in command reminded his boss. He looked at the only young man who couldn’t see through his cultivation and panicked.</p><p>It’s also Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>God damn it, this can’t be real!</p><p>“What spiritual technique?”</p><p>The bad feeling in the black-robed Xu Xiaoshou’s heart grew even stronger.</p><p>He looked at his subordinates who had stopped halfway and were hesitating.</p><p>He knew that they would not give up until they produced something.</p><p>The other party probably would not give up.</p><p>“Very good.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou? Very good!”</p><p>“It seems that you are determined to keep the famous sword if you don’t see it.”</p><p>Then.</p><p>The black-robed Xu Xiaoshou flipped his hand and a long box appeared in his palm.</p><p>“Pa da.”</p><p>After a sound, the long box was flipped over.</p><p>In an instant, sword intent soared into the sky.</p><p>“Weng Weng Weng –”</p><p>As if they had met the master of ten thousand swords along the way, the swords in the hands of the many sword cultivators present instantly shook uneasily.</p><p>“This is?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils constricted.</p><p>He had originally thought that this was a naive fake.</p><p>However, in the long wooden box that that fellow had taken out, there was a sword lying quietly. It seemed to be a famous sword?</p><p>A long sword!</p><p>“Crap, is a famous sword so common?!”</p><p>“How can such a person possess it?”</p><p>He was stunned for a moment.</p><p>“A famous sword?”</p><p>Su Qianqian also exclaimed in surprise. She had only felt the once familiar fluctuations of the famous sword in the air before she blurted out, “Green Scale Ridge!”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the lady.</p><p>Su Qianqian explained, “Green Scale Ridge is made from the bones of a dragon. It is ranked 15th on the famous sword list and is titled Dragon Sword.”</p><p>“Hiss.”</p><p>What a good fellow.</p><p>This was a qualified sword wielder!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed in admiration. Only then did he confirm that his feeling was not wrong.</p><p>However, how could a famous sword appear in the hands of such a person.</p><p>Wasn’t this sword wielder a little too weak?</p><p>“Where did you get your sword from?” Xu Xiaoshou was questioned.</p><p>“Why do you care where I came from? Also, what ‘Green Scale Ridge’? This is ‘Flame Python’!”</p><p>The black-robed Xu Xiaoshou felt that there was a small chance that he might have met an expert.</p><p>With such a convincing appearance, even the ranking of the famous sword was revealed. He almost believed it.</p><p>“Kid, this thing in your hand might kill you. Do you understand?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not in the mood to joke anymore. He took a step forward and covered the sky with his imposing manner. He asked, “Where did the Green Scale Ridge come from?”</p><p>Boom.</p><p>The ground slightly collapsed.</p><p>Everyone seemed to be in a gravitational space, and their movements were very obscure for a moment.</p><p>“It’s this move again?”</p><p>Rao Yinyin frowned.</p><p>This was the second time she had seen this strange spiritual technique, but she still couldn’t figure out what it was.</p><p>It was obvious that he didn’t even release his spiritual essence.</p><p>How did Xu Xiaoshou manage to materialize his aura?</p><p>“What Green Scale Ridge!”</p><p>The black-robed Xu Xiaoshou seemed to be in a mess.</p><p>With his Master Stage Spiritual cultivation, he was actually suppressed by that young man with just a single step.</p><p>How could this be justified?</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>With a hiss, he grabbed the ‘Green Scale Ridge’ from the long wooden box and swung it fiercely.</p><p>This time, the Innate Sword intent followed.</p><p>The long sword swept across the sky.</p><p>A magnificent green sword ray tore towards the people from the Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>Everyone panicked.</p><p>The Innate Sword intent itself wasn’t an ordinary existence.</p><p>With the support of the famous sword.</p><p>Just this casual slash of the sword ray could probably surpass most of the spiritual techniques of grandmasters!</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wanted to move, but she saw Su Qianqian shoot out.</p><p>“Ya –”</p><p>She pulled out a huge white sword from her ring and slashed at the green sword ray that was sweeping through the air.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The huge sword slashed down, and the void seemed to be split apart.</p><p>The sky was filled with green light spots that shattered.</p><p>The heavy sword had no edge, and even the sword radiance did not appear.</p><p>However, the wooden box in the hands of the distant black-robed Xu Xiaoshou exploded with this explosion.</p><p>“Chi Chi Chi!”</p><p>Following closely behind.</p><p>The clothes on her body shattered, and the mask on her face cracked. It completely fell off, revealing a panicked face.</p><p>It was a man with a silly face.</p><p>He had a square face, and his sideburns were full of stubble.</p><p>He was holding a famous sword, so he naturally looked down on everyone.</p><p>But looking at the little girl in white, his whole face turned green.</p><p>“Grandmaster-level Sword intent?”</p><p>The black-robed Xu Xiaoshou felt that his mind was blank.</p><p>This damn Xu Xiaoshou hadn’t come out yet, and a random little girl jumped out, and it was Grandmaster-level Sword intent?</p><p>“What kind of joke is this!”</p><p>He refused to believe it and once again held the ‘Green Scale Ridge’ in his hand and slashed it down.</p><p>“Weng!”</p><p>At the same time, a stream of sword aura shot out from the black-robed boss’ body.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou made his move.</p><p>The man was the sword, and he stopped that guy.</p><p>He drew his hand again, and the white sword aura filled the entire ‘Green Scale Ridge’. Under the intense resistance of the famous sword, it was pulled back into his hand.</p><p>“Does the famous sword have an owner?”</p><p>Seeing such intense resistance, Xu Xiaoshou turned his head and asked Su Qianqian.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Su Qianqian nodded. There was a little hesitation on her face.</p><p>“But, this guy is so weak and Green Scale Ridge is so arrogant. How could he listen to him?”</p><p>“He…”</p><p>“He’s not the sword wielder!” Xu Xiaoshou stared at the famous sword and suddenly said.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Everyone looked at him in surprise. Even the black-robed Xu Xiaoshou’s entire face was filled with fear.</p><p>These two guys..</p><p>Were real.</p><p>They were the real ones!</p><p>“Respected, passive value, + 1.”</p><p>“Feared, passive value, + 1.”</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held the famous sword and looked at it carefully.</p><p>This “Green Scale Ridge” was very slender.</p><p>The body of the sword was green and there were dragon scale patterns on it. It was simply extraordinary.</p><p>The handle was very narrow, but it was very thick. It looked like the body of a dragon was curled up.</p><p>In the middle was a golden reverse scale. It was blooming under the Crimson Sky.</p><p>And the handle of the sword was where the dragon’s head was.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held it and directly held half of the dragon’s head.</p><p>“Good sword!”</p><p>A strong spirituality came from the sword. Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise.</p><p>Every time he saw a famous sword, he would unconsciously sigh at nature’s craftsmanship.</p><p>The heavens and earth could actually produce such a spiritual sword.</p><p>It was simply unbelievable!</p><p>“Weng –”</p><p>The sound of vibration came one after another.</p><p>The resistance of this “Green Scale Ridge” was too strong.</p><p>Even though Xu Xiaoshou was a Grandmaster level, he couldn’t help but feel his palm split open from the tremors.</p><p>“I seem to have seen this sword before?”</p><p>There was a bit of doubt on his face. Xu Xiaoshou felt that this long sword seemed familiar.</p><p>He tilted his head and pondered for a moment before coming to a realization.</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>He had indeed seen this long sword before, but he had never crossed swords with it before.</p><p>At that time, when the ‘Flame Python’ was born, three sword cultivators that he had paid attention to had come.</p><p>Two of them were Gu Qinger and Gu Qingsan.</p><p>The remaining one was a young man who was wrapped in a mask and was heavily armed. However, he seemed to be trying to hide something.</p><p>This sword was a glimpse from his back.</p><p>“Red Robe?”</p><p>He still remembered that when the ‘Flame Python’ ended, the night watchman had called out to the young man. However, the young man did not listen and ran away.</p><p>So now, it was him who came over?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not speak.</p><p>“Perception” swept through all the black-robed men present.</p><p>As expected, not far behind the black-robed boss, among the few black-robed men who were still protecting him, he saw a youth who was very thin and small in comparison. His entire body was wrapped up tightly.</p><p>“Ha!”</p><p>“Still pretending?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grabbed the famous sword ‘Green Scale Ridge’ and sneered, “It’s already so late, why aren’t you showing yourself?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
