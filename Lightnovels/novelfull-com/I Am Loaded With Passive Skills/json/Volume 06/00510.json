When he had almost completely used up all the spiritual sources in his body, he chose to find a place to hide and then escape into his Yuan Mansion.</p><p>Now, he finally understood why space-type teleportation was a divine skill.</p><p>Even someone as powerful as the grey mist figure could only steal the Way of the Heavens’ energy movement to speed up his escape.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou was different.</p><p>Within the range of his Perception, he could appear at any time with a thought.</p><p>And the distance between each step was close to ten miles.</p><p>If his Perception became a bundle, he could even cover ten to twenty miles in a single step!</p><p>After six or seven consecutive Ascending to the Heavens in A Single Step teleportations, Xu Xiaoshou had left the battlefield seventy to eighty miles away.</p><p>This distance…</p><p>No matter how strong the Night Guardian was, he couldn’t catch up!</p><p>“Hu!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was on the run, finally had the strength to breathe a sigh of relief when he finally hid into his Yuan Mansion space.</p><p>He patted his chest, feeling that his back was completely drenched in a cold sweat.</p><p>In fact, Xu Xiaoshou had already seen the Storyteller come out of the ice layer the moment he decided to run away.</p><p>Although he had not sensed the subsequent discussions and battles between the three parties.</p><p>However, the outcome was no longer important.</p><p>“That guy…”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou was curious about who the man in the Red Dress was.</p><p>He was frozen to such a state, but he could still unseal himself?</p><p>According to his sixth sense, it was very likely that the man in the red dress who could trap him and the grey mist figure still had a backup plan!</p><p>In other words.</p><p>The final winner might not be the grey mist figure or the Night Guardian.</p><p>But the man in the Red Dress!</p><p>“Tsk tsk.”</p><p>“If that’s the case, then it’ll be very interesting…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and did not think too much about it.</p><p>Who the winner was in the end, and how he was doing, was no longer something that a small ant like him could pay attention to.</p><p>He only knew that after this escape, he would definitely be blacklisted by the Red Coat man.</p><p>Perhaps in the future, when he went out and met someone from the Holy Divine Palace, he would have to wear a mask, hide his figure well, and then go the opposite way.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>A low voice called out by his ear.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyes and looked over.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen!</p><p>“UH…”</p><p>He was stunned for a moment.</p><p>He had almost forgotten that there was a proud daughter of the Holy Divine Palace hidden in his Yuan Mansion!</p><p>“You’re awake?” he asked.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen nodded and looked around. “Where… is this?”</p><p>“Yuan Mansion.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that this young lady was smart enough to recognize that this was a Yuan Mansion space, so she immediately admitted it.</p><p>“Yuan Mansion? Cheng Xingchu’s piece?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was surprised.</p><p>Although she had guessed it earlier, when she found out that Xu Xiaoshou had completely restored his Yuan Mansion, she couldn’t help but be shocked.</p><p>A space-type spirit array master…</p><p>There wasn’t even a single one in the main division of the Holy Divine Palace!</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Mu Zixi took large steps and directly jumped in front of her Senior Brother. Her face was full of joy, and it was impossible to see the hidden curse.</p><p>“How is it outside? Is it dangerous?” She asked as she hugged Xu Xiaoshou’s arm.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen lowered her eyebrows and immediately looked away. Her red lips unconsciously pursed.</p><p>“It’s quite dangerous.”</p><p>“The seal ghost beast, Red Coat, and a guy who appeared out of nowhere… they are all very strong.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou bared his teeth and pulled her hand out of the tablet. He flicked his sleeve and said, “But who am I, your Senior Brother? I easily beat them until they were scared shitless. Then, I swaggered away with all the treasures… Bah, I ran away!”</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, +4.”</p><p>“You don’t believe me?”</p><p>He sneered and an ice lotus bloomed in his hand. “Check this out.”</p><p>“Three Days Frozen Calamity!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen immediately cried out in surprise.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what are you up to again? Didn’t you want to take that…” Mu Zixi was still full of doubt.</p><p>“I took it along the way!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled. “I’ve finished eating the watermelon, and there’s a bigger and more attractive pineapple in front of me. Do you want to eat it?”</p><p>“You had so much fun but you did not bring me along!” She snorted.</p><p>“Fun?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou recalled the previous scene and felt a lingering fear. “If you go out, it won’t be fun. It’ll be too good!”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>“Let’s not talk about this.”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Xu Xiaoshou stopped the two girls and stepped forward.</p><p>In this Yuan Mansion space, there were still many things that had yet to come to an end.</p><p>First, he looked up.</p><p>Little Monk Bu Le was still helplessly dangling as he was tied up by Dark Jade Whip.</p><p>This little cutie, who was muted, could do nothing but kill Xu Xiaoshou with a gaze filled with love.</p><p>Apart from that.</p><p>Above the three layers of spiritual herbs, there was still the Infernal White Skeleton, whose body was mostly broken, and the Ice Blue White Skeleton that was sent in later.</p><p>The sealing aura was still raging.</p><p>Obviously.</p><p>Until now, the latter still hadn’t broken free from the grey mist figure’s restraint.</p><p>The Ice Blue White Skeleton, which was fighting with a pure spiritual source, was completely restrained by the sealing power.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, isn’t this the White Skeleton that was trying to kill you? Why did you send it in?”</p><p>Mu Zixi followed her Senior Brother’s gaze and couldn’t help but ask, “And this… is it its sister?”</p><p>“It shouldn’t be its sister.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the Infernal White Skeleton that had a face full of hatred.</p><p>This fellow seemed like it wanted to roar.</p><p>However, in the Yuan Mansion space, Xu Xiaoshou trapped its thoughts and kept its mouth shut. How could it make a sound?</p><p>“If it’s not the sister, why did you pack it up and send it in?” Mu Zixi was puzzled. “It can’t even fit in anymore…”</p><p>These words were true.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the surrounding space with a headache.</p><p>The Yuan Mansion was small, to begin with.</p><p>The three layers of Spirit Fusion Swamp’s medicinal herbs were originally suspended in the air, so there was still a lot of space.</p><p>However, once these two big fellows entered, there was practically no extra space above them.</p><p>It was fortunate that the body of the Infernal White Skeleton was still incomplete.</p><p>If it had fully grown back.</p><p>He reckoned that one of these two big things would have to completely extend its feet into the chaotic mist in order to alleviate the crowded situation.</p><p>“It’s a little cramped…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his forehead and sighed.</p><p>He used to think that the Yuan Mansion space was quite big.</p><p>But now, it seemed like it wasn’t enough at all!</p><p>If any larger treasures wanted to enter in the future…</p><p>Based on the rate at which the Yuan Mansion space was expanding on its own, he reckoned that he could only choose to discard the inferior objects.</p><p>“I still have to find the second world-suppressing treasure as soon as possible. It would be best if it could help expand the Yuan Mansion space.”</p><p>“Otherwise, inside here…”</p><p>“Path Pattern Initial Stone!” Yu Zhiwen suddenly said from the side.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned his head to look.</p><p>“The Path Pattern Initial Stone can help to repair the space of the Small World. This thing is found in the White Cave. You can look for it later,” Yu Zhiwen said.</p><p>“Path Pattern Initial Stone?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up, and he became interested. “Tell me in detail.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen looked at the chaotic mist around her and finally fixed her eyes on the Spirit Mark of Life.</p><p>“This small world of your Yuan Mansion shouldn’t have been repaired by a spirit array master.”</p><p>“Otherwise, there wouldn’t be a situation where only the aura of life is enough and the space isn’t large enough.”</p><p>She paused for a moment and pointed at the chaotic mist around her. “The rules of the Small World are missing, but the space is activated by a treasure of the life attribute like you.”</p><p>“So, there won’t be any void cracks in your Yuan Mansion.”</p><p>“But this chaotic mist also occupies a large amount of available space.”</p><p>“If you don’t think of a way to get rid of it, just waiting for it to recover on its own. I estimate the time it will take…”</p><p>A smile appeared on Yu Zhiwen’s face. “It’s the entire process of a small world forming from nothing to something!”</p><p>From nothing to something…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face stiffened. “Doesn’t that mean that it will take hundreds of years?”</p><p>“Heh.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen couldn’t help but laugh. “You’re missing the words ‘ten thousand’.”</p><p>“Millions of years?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen nodded. “But it’s different with the Path Pattern Initial Stone.”</p><p>“This thing contains almost all of the Order of the Great Path of a complete world. This is a supreme treasure used by powerhouses above the Sovereign Stage to comprehend the Way of the Heavens.”</p><p>“Similarly, it also has the ability to repair the force of rules of a small world</p><p>“Once you obtain the Path Pattern Initial Stone and place it here, it can at least instantly expand your Yuan Mansion space by dozens of times</p><p>“In addition, the rate of spatial growth and the degree of perfection of the laws will be multiplied exponentially every day from now on</p><p>“In less than a few decades, perhaps your Yuan Mansion can really develop into a real-world!”</p><p>Hearing this, Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth immediately turned into an ‘o’ shape.</p><p>He was completely uninterested in the things that were said to be decades old.</p><p>But the part “expand your Yuan Mansion space by dozen times”…</p><p>“Dozens of times?” He asked in surprise.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen nodded her head in a slightly strange manner and said, “So what if it’s dozens of times? I’m even conservative in my estimation.”</p><p>“Your Yuan Mansion space has a life supreme treasure. What it lacks is the remaining Order of the Great Path. This is already far more perfect than other space-type treasures.”</p><p>“Then…” Yu Zhiwen pointed at the Treasure of suppressing barrier.</p><p>“The Spirit Mark of Life,” Xu Xiaoshou added.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen nodded. “In a sense, the Spirit Mark of Life is even more precious than the Path Pattern Initial Stone.”</p><p>“Because this thing is a treasure of suppressing barrier. As time passes, there will be a chance for it to merge with this world and undergo a qualitative change.”</p><p>“When that time comes, your Yuan Mansion space might even be able to give birth to life.”</p><p>“Hiss!” Xu Xiaoshou was shocked once again.</p><p>He had never thought that the thing he had stolen from Tianxuan Gate would be so precious.</p><p>But when he thought about it, it made sense.</p><p>His Yuan Mansion was only for private use.</p><p>As for the Tianxuan Gate, it was a large-scale extradimensional world that could be explored and trained by many people as a secret realm.</p><p>In comparison…</p><p>Yes.</p><p>There was no comparison at all.</p><p>“That’s not right.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts suddenly stopped. “That’s impossible too. Tianxuan Gate has possessed the Spirit Mark of Life for a long time. Why haven’t I seen any small life being born in it?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen couldn’t help but laugh.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you’re too naive.”</p><p>“Let alone intelligent life forms, even a life form without any intelligence wouldn’t appear so easily.”</p><p>“If you were to wait until your Yuan Mansion space can give birth to a life form, it would probably be tens of millions of years later.”</p><p>“All of this would have to be built upon the fact that you have already completely restored this space, including everything in the Way of the Heavens.”</p><p>“Tsk!” Xu Xiaoshou instantly lost interest. “What are you telling me about something that is going to take so long?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen covered her mouth and chuckled. “It’s because I see that your Yuan Mansion space is already ahead of many people. The possibility is a little low, but there is indeed a chance.”</p><p>“Enough, enough.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand repeatedly.</p><p>He estimated that he would pass this Yuan Mansion to his great-great-great… granddaughter.</p><p>Perhaps, everything that Yu Zhiwen said could be realized.</p><p>However, this girl’s wishful thinking gave Xu Xiaoshou a realistic hope.</p><p>“Path Pattern Initial Stone…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered and asked, “Do you know what this thing looks like and roughly where can it be found in the White Cave?”</p><p>“I’m not sure about that.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen shook her head. “The Path Pattern Initial Stone can appear in any form. It’s not fixed every time. It could be a stone, a leaf, or even a person…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes shone with a green light as he looked directly at Xu Xiaoji.</p><p>Xu Xiaoji was completely dumbfounded.</p><p>What’s going on?</p><p>What are you looking at me for?!</p><p>“I’m not the Path Pattern Initial Stone!” Xu Xiaoji said in terror.</p><p>He had already tried his best to keep himself in line. No matter what kind of big shot entered the White Cave, he did not make a sound.</p><p>But at this point, this Xu Xiaoshou… still wanted to sacrifice himself to the heavens?</p><p>“You must be a devil, right?!”</p><p>Glancing at the Spirit Mark of Life that was still hanging in the air and constantly being drained of its power, Xu Xiaoji was so terrified that his soul was panicking.</p><p>If he could only live like this in the future, he might as well find a piece of tofu and kill himself!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s voice paused, and she followed Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze and saw Xu Xiaoji.</p><p>She naturally knew that there was such a strange guy who didn’t speak in the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>But it was very obvious that this guy wasn’t the Path Pattern Initial Stone!</p><p>“Stop looking. This is a person, not a stone.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen rolled her beautiful eyes and glared at Xu Xiaoshou before continuing, “No matter what form the Path Pattern Initial Stone takes, it will have the strongest Way of the Heaven’s aura.”</p><p>“Even if you don’t know what it looks like, if you saw it, you would definitely be able to recognize it at a glance.”</p><p>“Don’t you have that ability?” As Yu Zhiwen spoke, her words suddenly turned sour.</p><p>“What ability?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen glanced at Mu Zixi. This little girl didn’t care.</p><p>However, when she looked at Xu Xiaoji beside him and the little monk above.</p><p>There were outsiders here, so it wasn’t appropriate to say it out loud.</p><p>“Just… that inner one.”</p><p>She looked up and indicated.</p><p>“An inner one?” Xu Xiaoshou was confused. “An inner one?”</p><p>Mu Zixi looked at the two people in front of her and was so angry that her ponytails were raised.</p><p>“Inner one…”</p><p>She seemed to have thought of something and her face suddenly turned red. She clenched her small fists tightly.</p><p>Good, Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Both of you have something going on behind my back?</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>Again?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the sudden curse and glanced at his Junior Sister.</p><p>Then, he looked at Yu Zhiwen drawing something in her hand, and suddenly understood.</p><p>The map of the White Cave!</p><p>Yes, and he also had the white bead in his mind.</p><p>If he wanted to find the Path Pattern Initial Stone, she only needed to sense where the Way of the Heavens’ energy movement was the densest. Then, he could follow the map and get it directly?</p><p>“Good fellow!”</p><p>“Little Yu, you’re too great. I understand.” Xu Xiaoshou was ecstatic and nodded repeatedly.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen saw that Xu Xiaoshou understood and smiled without saying anything more.</p><p>Previously, she had only doubted that Xu Xiaoshou had an accurate map of the White Cave.</p><p>But at this moment, she was completely certain.</p><p>Unlike the two’s riddles, Mu Zixi looked left and right. For a moment, her nose was wrinkled with anger.</p><p>What the hell is this!</p><p>What are the two of you hiding that I don’t know?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what is it?”</p><p>She suddenly appeared in front of Xu Xiaoshou and stopped the two of them from continuing to flirt with each other.</p><p>“What do kids know? I’ll tell you when you’re older.” Xu Xiaoshou pulled his Junior Sister away.</p><p>Great!</p><p>Only when I grow up?</p><p>As expected, the thing that you’re talking about is exactly what I think it is!</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>“Disliked, Passive Points, +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>“Sob sob.” Mu Zixi wiped her tears and staggered away. “Xu Xiaoshou, you’ve changed. You weren’t like this in the past.”</p><p>“What’s wrong with me now?” Xu Xiaoshou looked confused.</p><p>“Sob, sob, sob, you’re dirty…”</p><p>He was instantly stunned.</p><p>This Junior Sister, what was she always thinking about in her little head?</p><p>He couldn’t be bothered with this dirty-minded Junior Sister.</p><p>After getting the information about the Path Pattern Initial Stone, Xu Xiaoshou immediately had a new target.</p><p>After entering the White Cave, he didn’t have any special missions, to begin with.</p><p>Therefore, taking advantage of the fact that this experiential learning trip wasn’t over yet, he had to obtain all the treasures that could perfect his strength system.</p><p>If that was the case…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the space in his Yuan Mansion as if he could see the boundless prairie in the future.</p><p>In his own Yuan Mansion Prairie, he could plant spiritual herbs, conduct alchemy, raise fish, and play with cats.</p><p>If he had nothing to do, he could take pictures of the Infernal White Skeleton. If he was tired, he could tease his Junior Sister. If he was sleepy, he could…</p><p>Ugh.</p><p>Glancing at Yu Zhiwen, whose face had turned red from Mu Zixi’s words, Xu Xiaoshou decisively interrupted his thoughts of letting go.</p><p>The danger of the White Cave had yet to be completely resolved!</p><p>If he encountered a Red Coat, he reckoned that he didn’t even need to think about the Path Pattern Initial Stone.</p><p>Hiding in a White Cave to retire and wait for death was indeed achievable.</p><p>He might just have to wait it out. Once the space was broken, the Night Guardian would drag him out to purify his thoughts!</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>His body trembled. Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to delay any longer.</p><p>Strength!</p><p>Or rather, before his strength reached the standard, he needed two bodyguards.</p><p>The two were extremely muscular and their strength was also extremely terrifying. They were at least bodyguards above the Sovereign Stage.</p><p>He raised his head.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the two big guys in the space above him and his thoughts spun wildly.</p><p>That’s right.</p><p>After possessing the Infernal Original Seed, Xu Xiaoshou no longer had any interest in the Advanced Infernal Fire Seed in the skull of the Infernal White Skeleton.</p><p>What he had his eyes on was this skeleton!</p><p>All of them!</p><p>With a swoosh, Xu Xiaoshou immediately flew into the sky and arrived in front of the Infernal White Skeleton.</p><p>“Hohoho…”</p><p>The White Skeleton was actually roaring.</p><p>However, under the Way of the Heavens’ silence, the only sound that came out of its mouth was an intense exhale.</p><p>“Hehe.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled as he looked at the thing in front of him. He recalled the painful experience of being chased for several hours.</p><p>“Little guy, I can let bygones be bygones. Now, I have a plan for you. I need your cooperation.”</p><p>“Can I?”</p><p>“Hohoho…” the White Skeleton roared silently, its eyes full of hatred.</p><p>“Don’t be so resistant.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou patted its head and pointed at the crack on its body. “I know you have spiritual intelligence, and you can understand me.”</p><p>“Now, I’ll give you two choices.”</p><p>“First, I’ll tear open the wound on your body and throw all your bones into the chaotic mist to melt. Then, I’ll smash your skull and take out the thing I want.” Xu Xiaoshou pointed at the chaotic mist.</p><p>“Ho…”</p><p>The skeleton’s voice suddenly lowered, and a hint of fear appeared in his eyes.</p><p>Even though it had never experienced it personally, its instincts told him that if he was really thrown into the chaotic mist, there was no hope of recovering from his injuries.</p><p>There was only death!</p><p>“Are you afraid?”</p><p>“It’s good that you’re afraid.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded in satisfaction. He extended his second finger and said, “The second way is to submit to me. I can…”</p><p>“Hohoho!”</p><p>Before he could finish his words, the fellow in front of him started to riot.</p><p>Along with the violent cries, the void started to distort as if it was going to be shattered in the next second.</p><p>“Darn…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was enraged. “You want to tear down my house right under my nose? Even a dog is not as arrogant as you!”</p><p>He suddenly pulled out the Flame Python and slashed at the ankle of the skeleton’s incomplete body.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Under the void sword intent, the White Skeleton’s ankle was instantly broken.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lifted it up with his sword and directly threw it into the chaotic mist.</p><p>“Chi Chi…”</p><p>In an instant, the sound of corrosion was heard.</p><p>After more than ten breaths, the White Skeleton’s foot was completely destroyed by the chaotic mist.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>A painful sound was heard.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sheathed his sword and stood still. “Scream again? If you scream again, do you believe that I will chop off your other foot?”</p><p>“Hohohohoho…”</p><p>The White Skeleton went crazy and twisted its body.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sneered. He did not want to be polite at all. He lifted the Flame Python and was about to chop it down with his foot.</p><p>“Hu!”</p><p>“Hu!”</p><p>The Infernal White Skeleton panicked. Its roar turned into an exhale, and he blew at Xu Xiaoshou with a defiant look in his eyes.</p><p>“Isn’t that good?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou snorted. “It’s good to be a good baby. My Baby Aje is a role model that all of you need to learn from!”</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoji, who was hiding in a corner, could not help but shiver when he saw Xu Xiaoshou, who looked like he was possessed by a devil.</p><p>“Baby Aje…”</p><p>“Is this his nickname for Aje?”</p><p>“As expected, they are all devils!”</p><p>Tears were coming out of Xu Xiaoji’s eyes. He felt helpless and lost. “Oh God, when will I be free? Only then will I be able to leave, sob sob sob…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
