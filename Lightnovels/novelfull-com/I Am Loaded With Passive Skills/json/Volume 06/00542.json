It’s not the time yet!”</p><p>“Sit, don’t, down…”</p><p>Blue veins popped out on He Yuxing’s forehead. He shouted at the top of his voice, “I can feel the Sword Will in the body of ‘Fourth Sword’. It can see me too. It’s…”</p><p>“Summon me!”</p><p>Summon?</p><p>Lan Xinzi was stunned.</p><p>In the next second.</p><p>The flying fierce sword seemed to have finally come to an end. It shook in the void excitedly.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>In an instant, the void cracked and the earth disintegrated.</p><p>The black sword qi spread out in all directions, slashing the people behind it who had not had time to chase after it and forcing them to retreat.</p><p>“Fourth Sword. There’s movement!”</p><p>Everyone was envious.</p><p>Previously, even if someone had touched or even held ‘Fourth Sword’, there had never been a time when its reaction was so intense.</p><p>Now, just by flying in a certain direction, it had such a reaction.</p><p>“Fourth Sword, what did you sense?”</p><p>Everyone subconsciously felt that something was wrong.</p><p>If this situation continued, wouldn’t the sword wielder of the fierce sword come out?</p><p>Then what should they do?</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>The spiritual source blocked off the fierce sword’s intent, and everyone immediately chased after it.</p><p>At the same time, on the path of the ‘Fourth Sword’, a pile of rubble exploded, and a white-clothed figure soared into the sky.</p><p>“‘Fourth Sword’, belong to me!”</p><p>A roar reverberated in the air.</p><p>Lan Xinzi was dumbfounded as she watched He Yuxing soar into the sky. Then, under everyone’s incredulous gazes, she tightly gripped the ‘Fourth Sword’ that brushed past her!</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>As expected, the demonic qi that instantly surged into her body exploded with a loud bang in the air.</p><p>“PFFT, another idiot…”</p><p>The pursuers behind her stopped in their tracks as they snickered.</p><p>However, before they could finish mocking her, they saw that the demonic qi had dissipated. A half-naked man whose clothes had been blasted to the point that only strips of blood could be seen was standing there with a fierce sword in his hand. His eyes were filled with disdain!</p><p>“He, he didn’t die?”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>This was the first person who had not been blown to death by the backlash of the demonic qi after holding the ‘Fourth Sword’!</p><p>Not only that.</p><p>The Sword Will of this man with a large number of devil veins on his body was actually faintly complementary to the ‘Fourth Sword’. It was full of the same origin.</p><p>“He Yuxing…”</p><p>Lan Xinzi’s beautiful eyes were filled with shock. She looked at the man standing in the air with a sword in his hand in a daze.</p><p>It had to be said that He Yuxing, whose black hair was fluttering in the sword qi, had an unspeakable wild and unruly temperament when paired with the devil veins that covered his entire body like a black snake.</p><p>He Yuxing lifted the ‘Fourth Sword’ in the air with one hand.</p><p>Dark red blood beads seeped out from his cracked body.</p><p>The blood beads gathered in the crevices of his streamlined muscles and turned into droplets that dripped down the mermaid line.</p><p>“Take a step forward and die!”</p><p>He raised the sword upside down.</p><p>With that, the Sword Will shattered the surroundings and shook the entire space until it split apart like the Eight Trigrams Sword Net.</p><p>To be honest, He Yuxing did not want to take the sword.</p><p>Even if Lan Xinzi did not say it, he knew that he was being used.</p><p>However, when ‘Fourth Sword’ shot directly in the direction where he was hiding, the calls that came from the same source were not something he could suppress at all.</p><p>He flew out.</p><p>It was not voluntary, it was also voluntary!</p><p>However.</p><p>If he took this sword, he would just take it!</p><p>Only when the fierce sword was in his hands and he felt the terrifying power that could destroy the world with just one hand.</p><p>Only then did He Yuxing realize that all the worries he had before were all false.</p><p>Anyone, anything that obstructed him..</p><p>Fourth Sword, and he could kill them with just this one sword!</p><p>“TA.”</p><p>The person who wanted to take this opportunity to steal the vicious sword stopped in his tracks and froze in mid-air.</p><p>“He really caught it?”</p><p>“Who is this guy? Where did he come from? Why does he look so unfamiliar?”</p><p>“I’m not sure, but I’m very clear…”</p><p>The person who spoke looked at the Eight Trigrams Sword Net that spread out for thousands of feet under He Yuxing’s feet, and the demonic qi on the cracks kept rising. He couldn’t help but swallow a mouthful of saliva.</p><p>“I only know that if I take another step forward, I will really… die, right?”</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>A light figure shot out from the crowd that had stopped moving.</p><p>Some people were shocked, while others didn’t believe it at all.</p><p>Everyone already knew the power of the ‘Fourth Sword’.</p><p>This person in front of him had the cultivation of a grandmaster. Just by suppressing the continuous demonic qi from the fierce sword into his body, he had almost exhausted all of his strength.</p><p>How could he still have the strength to use the true power of the ‘Fourth Sword’?</p><p>“Playing tricks, go to Hell!”</p><p>The golden spiritual source fluctuation exploded in the air along with the scolding sound.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the person who charged forward condensed a ball of scorching energy that was as hot as the sun.</p><p>“The light of fireflies…”</p><p>He Yuxing narrowed his eyes, his gaze complicated.</p><p>The ball of scorching energy in front of him..</p><p>If this was in the past, this grandmaster might have been able to use this spirit skill to deal damage to him.</p><p>But at this moment, with ‘Fourth Sword’ in hand, he even felt that he didn’t need to use a sword at all.</p><p>With just a look, he could kill the other party.</p><p>“Scram!”</p><p>His palm tightened.</p><p>The demonic qi that ‘Fourth Sword’ had entered his body stopped for a moment. Then, it responded to the surging Sword Will that exploded and swept towards the person who was rushing over like a wave crashing onto the shore.</p><p>However, He Yuxing’s Sword Will had yet to cover the person who came.</p><p>A black force circle surged out from the body of the Fourth Sword, but it had already covered the person in front of him.</p><p>In just an instant.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The black sword qi that exploded in the person’s body was like an expanding hedgehog. It directly cut his body into pieces and scattered in all directions.</p><p>Following closely behind was He Yuxing’s Sword Will that covered the sky.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The ground sank, and the pieces of flesh were directly pressed into the ground.</p><p>“…”</p><p>The scene was deathly silent.</p><p>They only tightened their hands, and they didn’t even raise their swords.</p><p>The person who launched the sneak attack was destroyed in body and soul?</p><p>“What the hell…”</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>As long as one had eyes, it wasn’t difficult to see that the power of the ‘Fourth Sword’ itself was much stronger than that of the sword wielder.</p><p>He Yuxing did not even need to make a move.</p><p>His heart was where his thoughts were.</p><p>This fierce sword could help him tear the enemy in front of him into pieces!</p><p>“Wait, Sword Will!”</p><p>Finally, someone saw He Yuxing, who had lost his luster, from the light of the ‘Fourth Sword’.</p><p>Although his attack was slower than the fierce sword.</p><p>But the surging Sword Will that pressed the pieces of flesh to the ground..</p><p>“Grandmaster Level?”</p><p>“This guy is actually a master swordsman!”</p><p>Everyone’s pupils constricted again.</p><p>It was only at this moment that everyone shifted their gaze away from the body of the ‘Fourth Sword’ sword and saw He Yuxing, who was also looking at the ‘Fourth Sword’ in a daze in midair.</p><p>Grandmaster Sword Will!</p><p>It wasn’t a spirit skill, nor was it some other miscellaneous Way of the Heavens.</p><p>This pure Sword Will was something that could only be comprehended by having an extremely deep understanding of the Sword Will itself.</p><p>“Could it be that the lowest bargaining chip to be able to hold ‘Fourth Sword’ is grandmaster Sword Will?”</p><p>Someone spoke out in a daze.</p><p>If that was really the case, then none of these clowns had the qualifications to touch that fierce sword.</p><p>It was already difficult to find an innate Sword Will.</p><p>Sword ancestor..</p><p>“I’m getting tired.”</p><p>He Yuxing looked at the group of people in front of him who had suddenly become disheartened and didn’t say anything.</p><p>After this ‘Fourth Sword’ strike, it was already a declaration that he was invincible among his peers.</p><p>Why would he need to look at these ants in front of him?</p><p>He turned his head and looked into the distance. “Senior Red-robed, does what I said earlier still count?”</p><p>Red-robed had said before.</p><p>If anyone could take down ‘Fourth Sword’, they could even protect him and prevent him from getting hurt in the White Cave.</p><p>Everyone turned their heads.</p><p>At this moment, as long as Red-robed nodded his head, then ‘Fourth Sword’, everyone would have no chance.</p><p>“Lan Ling?”</p><p>Xin also turned his head to look at Lan Ling.</p><p>Obviously, the red-robed consul should have come out to speak at this moment.</p><p>“Information.”</p><p>Lan Ling didn’t reply. She turned her head to look behind her.</p><p>Although there was only a short period of time just now.</p><p>But given this period of time, the red-robed consul would be able to completely dig out the information of the person in charge of the ‘Fourth Sword’.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>A red-robed person took a step forward and spoke:</p><p>“He Yuxing, Master Heavenly Image State. He broke through not long ago, Grandmaster Sword Will. He broke through not long ago, and is one of the thirty-three people in the inner court of the Tiansang Spirit Palace.”</p><p>“The innate attribute energy is very special. It is a sword that can condense into the form of illusion. It is considered a top-notch talent in the field of Sword Arts.”</p><p>“As for the rest, there is no record of it. However, based on the initial observation, the runes on his body should be from the ‘Sacrificial Carving’. In other words, he has comprehended a tiny bit of the Eighth Sword Deity’s Sword Will.”</p><p>“This should be the reason why he was able to grasp the ‘Fourth Sword’.”</p><p>“That’s it?” Lan Ling asked.</p><p>“That’s it.” The red-robed lady replied, “We have to send someone to the Tiansang Spirit Palace to obtain the specific information. Currently, there’s only so much that the outside world can give us.”</p><p>“Go and investigate immediately!”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Lan Ling paused for a moment before asking, “What about the other one?”</p><p>She did not say it directly, but the red-robed lady already knew that she was talking about the lady who He Yuxing had previously been hiding in.</p><p>“An ordinary grandmaster, no threat.”</p><p>Lan Ling nodded. With a wave of her hand, Red-robed retreated.</p><p>She turned to look at He Yuxing who was still waiting. With a smile, she said loudly, “Red-robed’s promise is naturally effective!”</p><p>With a whoosh, the rest of the people who were still waiting immediately became anxious.</p><p>If she agreed, wouldn’t it be the same as announcing the result of ‘Fourth Sword’?</p><p>There were so many people here, and they could only watch helplessly as the man with the Devil Vein… took the sword and left?</p><p>He Yuxing’s eyes couldn’t help but flash with hidden joy.</p><p>Admittedly, he was confident that he could face the other contenders for the ‘Fourth Sword’, but this fierce sword..</p><p>To be honest, the demonic qi that continuously entered his body was almost over the limit.</p><p>At this moment, he was also in a state of overload.</p><p>If he continued to hold on, he would probably explode and die. That was the inevitable outcome.</p><p>Red-robed could keep her promise, and Lan Xinzi and he could leave the Lijian Grassland in peace.</p><p>This ending could not be better.</p><p>“Thank you…”</p><p>“But!”</p><p>Lan Ling interrupted him with a smile and said, “What we said earlier was that if anyone could obtain the recognition of ‘Fourth Sword’, Red-robed could even escort them out of the White Cave.”</p><p>“As for you, have you really obtained the recognition of ‘Fourth Sword’?”</p><p>He Yuxing’s expression stiffened.</p><p>As if he was echoing Lan Ling’s words, his chest suddenly trembled and he let out a muffled groan. Black and red blood seeped out from the corner of his lips.</p><p>“He can’t hold on anymore!”</p><p>Someone with sharp eyes immediately cried out in mid-air, “This fellow is also trying to hang on. Although he has obtained ‘Fourth Sword’, the grandmaster Sword Will can only protect him for the first wave.”</p><p>“How can it be so easy to obtain the recognition of the ‘Fourth Sword’?”</p><p>“That’s right!”</p><p>“This fellow is fighting to the death. He’s bleeding profusely. He’s not getting recognition at all. He’s forcefully suppressing the fiendish aura of the ‘Fourth Sword’!”</p><p>“Let go of the ‘Fourth Sword’ and let me do it –”</p><p>He Yuxing could not even be bothered with these people who made everyone speechless.</p><p>This was because the swords were in his hands. That was why everyone would follow the red-robed man’s words.</p><p>If the swords were in their hands..</p><p>The faces of these people would definitely be another exciting scene.</p><p>He fixed his gaze on the red-robed Lan Ling and said deeply, “I didn’t expect that a dignified red-robed man would actually play a so-called word game?”</p><p>“This isn’t a game.”</p><p>Lan Ling shook her head calmly. “What we’re looking for is the true sword wielder of ‘Fourth Sword’, and not someone with a strong will.”</p><p>“There are plenty of people like you in White Cave. There’s no need for the red-robed person to go through so much trouble to protect you.”</p><p>“And before ‘Fourth Sword’ truly recognizes its master…”</p><p>Lan Ling smiled and said, “It’s just a treasure of a slightly higher level. Fighting for it is a necessary path for the birth of a supreme treasure. We, the red-robed people, will not stop it.”</p><p>Everyone in the air was excited.</p><p>Red-robed’s words were a confirmation of everyone’s qualification to fight for the ‘Fourth Sword’.</p><p>And as long as the final outcome was not set in stone.</p><p>Even if Devil Vein man obtained the ‘Fourth Sword’, he would not be able to escape death!</p><p>Quality could not compete with quality.</p><p>Quantity, even if everyone added together, would they not be able to defeat this person who was on the verge of death due to the fierce sword?</p><p>“A bunch of trash!”</p><p>He Yuxing was finally angered by the ugly faces of these people in front of him.</p><p>“There are ‘Fourth Sword’ here. Anyone who wants them can come and take them!”</p><p>He tilted his sword slightly and grandmaster Sword Will filled the sky. Majestic Demonic Qi rose from the sword and surged into his body.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>All the Spiritual Cultivators’ swords in the Lijian Grassland trembled. Even the famous swords were affected.</p><p>The demonic qi that entered He Yuxing’s body finally exploded after a few breaths.</p><p>In an instant, the remaining demonic qi within a radius of ten miles was summoned. As the mist rose, it formed a huge black devil ball that surrounded half of the Lijian Grassland.</p><p>“Realm, realm?”</p><p>Not to mention the group of youths, they were all shocked.</p><p>Even the people in the red-robed were shocked by the power of the ‘Fourth Sword’.</p><p>He Yuxing was only at the celestial phenomenon realm.</p><p>However, the moment he held the sword, he opened up a domain that was no weaker than the throne realm?</p><p>“Seizing the sword… right?”</p><p>A scarlet light appeared in He Yuxing’s eyes. He suspended the sword in the air and raised both his hands. He was completely immersed in the domain that belonged to the ‘Fourth Sword’.</p><p>At this moment, He Yuxing was the ruler!</p><p>“Come!”</p><p>“Come and fight!”</p><p>He shouted.</p><p>He Yuxing formed a fist and nodded.</p><p>The black demonic sphere that covered half of the Lijian Grassland shook and completely formed.</p><p>— the domain was activated, the fierce demon world!</p><p>“Chi Chi Chi…”</p><p>Suddenly, black sword qi shot out from all over the void and instantly tore the group of people in front of He Yuxing into pieces.</p><p>At this moment, everything was silent.</p><p>Blood splattered and withered. Everything appeared peaceful and beautiful.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
