Why were they acting so surprised?</p><p>“Is this really a Saint Servant?” the White-clothed people looked at each other.</p><p>They couldn’t be blamed for eavesdropping.</p><p>It was true that Elder Wuyue was able to ignore a few mighty figures. It was already extremely eye-catching that he had chosen to talk to this young man first.</p><p>And now, even Gou Wuyue himself seemed to have come into contact with such a situation for the first time…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth seemed to be a little too sharp.</p><p>Gou Wuyue tightened his grip on his sword.</p><p>The corners of his mouth twitched slightly. After muttering to himself for a while, he opened his mouth…and closed it again.</p><p>Following which, under the probing expression of the young man before him, he pressed down on his twitching eyebrows and said in a slightly strange voice, “You, are you serious?”</p><p>“Uh-huh,” Xu Xiaoshou gave a snort.</p><p>“Blown away, passive points +421.”</p><p>“Impressed, passive points +669.”</p><p>“Admired, passive points +342.”</p><p>The group of White-clothed people went crazy.</p><p>“Uh-huh?”</p><p>“D*mn, this kid is crazy. He used ‘Uh-huh’? He talked to Elder Wuyue and used ‘Uh-huh’?”</p><p>“Even if the King of Heavens falls is in front of me today, I, Old Sun, will definitely not bend down and help him up. Today, I’m in awe of this guy!”</p><p>“Uh-huh… how confident is he?”</p><p>“He’s obviously so ordinary and he’s just a young man. He… how did he have the confidence to say such a thing and even naively want Elder Wuyue to agree to his rude request?”</p><p>“If the sandpiper and clam fight, who will win, and who will leave?”</p><p>“F*ck! F*ck!”</p><p>The scene was deathly silent.</p><p>However, under White-clothed’s crazy telepathic communication, the space rippled slightly.</p><p>Everyone looked at the naive and silly guy. It was hard to imagine how well protected this greenhouse flower was by the elders. Only at this age could he still maintain such a childlike innocence and say such childish words.</p><p>This…</p><p>His words were so childish that it was as if water could be squeezed out. There was this strong urge that one could not help but want to crush it on the spot!</p><p>Gou Wuyue took a deep breath.</p><p>In his mind, the flashy operation that Wen Ming had done to the Night Guardian in the ancient book’s space appeared. At that time, he did not know why the Night Guardian had been forced into such a state by a mere youth. Now that he was in a similar position, he understood.</p><p>“You know who I am, don’t you?” Gou Wuyue couldn’t help but laugh.</p><p>He felt relieved and let go.</p><p>He seemed to see the child version of himself.</p><p>“I know!” Xu Xiaoshou nodded seriously, “Didn’t I say it just now… Hmm?”</p><p>As he said that, his eyes suddenly lit up, and he murmured, “So you’re the Moonless Sword Deity…”</p><p>Then, with a solemn bow, Xu Xiaoshou straightened his back and shouted loudly, “Aren’t you the legendary person who could kill the second Saint Servant and cause him to flee, as well as chase after the seventh Saint Servant…”</p><p>“? ? ?”</p><p>Everyone immediately staggered and almost fell to their knees.</p><p>Gou Wuyue’s old face instantly turned red.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>With a shout that was several decibels higher than that of the young man in front of him, he suppressed the exaggerated praises, and his hand that was grabbing the sword began to tremble slightly.</p><p>They had only met once, and he, Gou Wuyue, who had been a hero for his entire life, had almost been turned into an existence that liked to suck up by this brat. He had almost been destroyed!</p><p>Who could withstand this?</p><p>“Since you know who I am, you still dare to joke with me?” Gou Wuyue’s expression became serious. The clouds in his eyes were treacherous, and there was already a cold Sword Will in them.</p><p>“I’m not joking. I’m serious.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded, “I have something on you, Moonless Sword Deity.”</p><p>Something…something…</p><p>“? ? ?”</p><p>“Being suspected, passive points +733.”</p><p>“Impressed, passive points +666.”</p><p>This time, not only were White-clothed stunned, even the Storyteller, who couldn’t help but want to drag that embarrassing thing back, stopped in his tracks.</p><p>He and Cen Qiaofu looked at each other.</p><p>The latter was carrying an unconscious person on his back. He had a dumbfounded expression on his face as if he was asking this kid if he had always been in this kind of situation?</p><p>The Storyteller responded with a look. How could he know? Cen Qiaofu might as well ask the person on his back!</p><p>“You’ve got something on me?”</p><p>Gou Wuyue whispered and raised the famed sword up high.</p><p>He said coldly, “You can choose to say it, but if this doesn’t constitute a so-called ‘leverage’, I will ‘draw the sword’. Understand?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately felt a chill down his spine.</p><p>Understand his a*s!</p><p>He’s f*cking poisonous!</p><p>Why would he dare to speak to Gou Wuyue like this if he didn’t have something on him?</p><p>Even though he had something on him, Gou Wuyue was still making a move?</p><p>If he wanted to do this…</p><p>“Then I choose not to speak.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou flashed and directly hid behind the Storyteller. He glanced at the red coat in front of him and silently moved to Cen Qiaofu’s back.</p><p>Then, he poked his head out from behind the masked man’s shoulder, “You said that I can choose.”</p><p>The veins on Gou Wuyue’s forehead twitched.</p><p>“Being glared at, passive points +1.”</p><p>The crowd of White-clothed people suddenly began to rustle.</p><p>All sorts of small movements were about to appear, but they suddenly sensed that the Sword Will that filled the sky had already come down. Instantly, they became solemn and obedient, turning into White-clothed sculptures that stood straight.</p><p>“In awe, passive points +315.”</p><p>“Hahaha…” Cen Qiaofu raised his head and laughed loudly.</p><p>He did not know why the Chief always treated this young man differently, but after this confrontation, he already felt that the temperament of the kid hiding behind him was just to his taste.</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>With a solemn face and a low voice, Cen Qiaofu sneered as he threw his small ax and said disdainfully, “Gou Wuyue dared to ‘draw his sword’, but he can’t ‘remove it’. If the sky falls today, this old man will hold it up for you!”</p><p>Then, he turned his head.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s gaze was burning, “Xiao Shi, Tan Ji, do you understand?”</p><p>What the h*ll did he know!</p><p>He was not a curse, remove what!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stole a glance at Gou Wuyue, and it made him panic.</p><p>He is the Sword Deity!</p><p>With Cen Qioafu’s old body, could he hold it up?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to say anything else. He felt that he was being too impulsive.</p><p>In this kind of gathering of big shots, the best way was to eliminate his sense of presence. How could he stand out and speak like this!</p><p>His reckless mouth would cause trouble, but did he not know how to act?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lowered his waist even more.</p><p>But Cen Qiaofu was also angrier.</p><p>“Xiao Shi, Tan Ji!”</p><p>With a shout, the admiration in his eyes turned into pressure. Xu Xiaoshou’s body trembled and he immediately flashed behind the Storyteller.</p><p>The Storyteller slightly pulled open his high leg red coat. His skin was as fair as jade, and he had a kind and pleasant countenance.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart twitched, and he immediately retreated.</p><p>What kind of person is this? F*ck!</p><p>What kind of pile has he entered?</p><p>Why did they all have to stare at him and speak first? Can’t they fight amongst themselves?</p><p>There was the pressure of Gou Wuyue in front of him, and there was the pressure of Cen Qiaofu beside him…</p><p>A Holy Divine Palace, a Saint Servant…</p><p>These two men were advancing and retreating!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had no choice but to admit defeat. Who asked the Moonless Sword Deity to grab him for no reason?</p><p>He took a few steps back and distanced himself from these two groups. After hesitating for a moment, he said weakly, “It’s hard for me to deal with you guys like this…”</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Xu Xiaoshou asked with an inquisitive look, “How about this? I have something on you, and I won’t say much. I’ll just say half of it, this way I won’t offend anyone?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>One breath.</p><p>Two breaths.</p><p>Three breaths.</p><p>The scene was silent for a full three breaths, and then…</p><p>“Being doubted, passive points +741.”</p><p>“Acknowledged, passive points +666.”</p><p>“Praised, passive points +232.”</p><p>“Respected, passive points +418.”</p><p>After everyone was stunned, the information bar suddenly started to sputter.</p><p>Then, the information suddenly changed.</p><p>“Being glared at, passive points +2.”</p><p>“Hostile, passive points +2.”</p><p>“Suppressed, passive points +2.”</p><p>“Sneak attack, passive points +1.”</p><p>F*ck!!!</p><p>When he saw the “Sneak attack” message, Xu Xiaoshou’s heart almost jumped out of his chest.</p><p>“F*ck… Hold back your sword! Hold back your sword!” he cried out in surprise.</p><p>Without thinking, he cast the ‘Vanishing Technique’ on the spot followed by ‘Ascending to the Heavens in A Single Step’ out of his shell and moved away.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A streak of sword energy shot out, but it was cut off by Cen Qiaofu’s ax when it got close to him.</p><p>The void rippled.</p><p>Then, in all directions, as if the mirror was shattered by the sound waves, it was immediately torn apart.</p><p>However, the space was not completely shattered yet. Under the guidance of the Sword Will of the Ten Directions, it turned into countless small void stiletto swords and returned to the space.</p><p>The Mirror of Heaven and Earth wanted to be broken, but human power did not want it to be broken.</p><p>Human power sewed the Heaven and Earth, and the world of Sword Realm was born.</p><p>“Sword Realm… bounded domain!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu paused for a moment and then realized that Gou Wuyue’s bounded domain had opened. He shouted.</p><p>At the same time, the Storyteller flipped his palm and stood up. The golden light of the ‘Yin Yang Life and Death Trap’ in his hand dissipated.</p><p>A single word danced and floated out, reflecting the entire world.</p><p>“Wrong!”</p><p>The spirit was summoned, and Heaven and Earth returned to sound.</p><p>The laws of the Order of the great path were forcefully thrown into disorder at this moment. Time and space were staggered and overlapped as if two clouds had converged and were indistinguishable from each other.</p><p>Then, the Storyteller pinched his hand into orchid-shaped fingers and tapped lightly in the air.</p><p>“Split!”</p><p>All the White-clothed people felt the scene in front of them blur.</p><p>The Sword Realm world created by Gou Wuyue seemed to have been moved away and disappeared.</p><p>In its place was a brand-new space.</p><p>It was as if…</p><p>Everything returned to the moment when the Saint Servant and the other two stepped out of the spatial crack in the White Cave.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>Everyone felt their scalps go numb.</p><p>Very few people could fully understand the violent collision that had happened just now.</p><p>However, at that moment, the Way of the Heavens was in chaos, and everyone felt as if they had completely lost their defenses.</p><p>If the enemy had chosen to attack at that time…</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>“What ability does this red coat man have? It’s been so long, but the research team still can’t give an accurate assessment?”</p><p>“It’s always like this. You won’t even know how you died!”</p><p>Some people were terrified, while others were calm and collected.</p><p>“Don’t worry, we still have Elder Wuyue watching over us!”</p><p>..</p><p>On the other side, Xu Xiaoshou was so scared that he almost peed.</p><p>This motherf*cker didn’t even make a single movement, and he directly wanted to kill him!</p><p>Did he have to be so exaggerated? He was just a baby…</p><p>He didn’t even dare to remove his disappearing state. He moved through space many times, but at a certain point, he stopped as if he had hit a barrier.</p><p>“As expected…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart turned cold.</p><p>It was the same as when he encountered the Storyteller.</p><p>As expected, he couldn’t get out!</p><p>But thinking about it, it made sense. The Storyteller was already so strong.</p><p>If the White-clothed were so well-prepared and still didn’t banish the entire space, then Cen Qiaofu and the others probably wouldn’t be interested in listening to his nonsense.</p><p>“But…”</p><p>“Should I strike?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt the atmosphere that was suddenly suppressed. Then, he looked at Gou Wuyue and Cen Qiaofu, who were full of killing intent, and felt their legs go soft!</p><p>“Hold on.”</p><p>He dispelled his disappearing state and reappeared from far away.</p><p>The arena immediately turned their heads and looked over.</p><p>“Being suspected, passive points +611.”</p><p>“Conjecture, passive points +499.”</p><p>“This guy…”</p><p>“That’s right, did that guy just disappear? He didn’t die? I thought he died on the spot.”</p><p>“Vanishing Technique!”</p><p>“If he’s Wen Ming, it should be the Vanishing Technique… and Spatial Movement. Good lad, what’s his origin? He has so many divine skills!”</p><p>“It is already very impressive that he is still alive with his cultivation level…”</p><p>White-clothed people discussed amongst themselves animatedly. Finally, they recalled that the fuse that caused the confrontation between the two parties was actually this young man who should have died in the collision.</p><p>“Xiao Shi, Tan Ji…”</p><p>Gou Wuyue turned his head to look at the young man, and a look of certainty flashed across his eyes.</p><p>The mysterious Vanishing Technique, as well as the Space Order that should not appear on a young man with a low cultivation level…</p><p>No wonder this guy was able to trick the Storyteller in the White Cave!</p><p>After the first round of testing, Gou Wuyue got the answer he wanted.</p><p>He didn’t continue to comment. Instead, he turned his sword sideways and slowly closed it towards the scabbard.</p><p>“Ta.”</p><p>“Sneak attack, passive points +1.”</p><p>F*ck!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw Gou Wuyue put away his sword and thought that things were over. He was considering his words, thinking about how he should say them.</p><p>Who would have thought that this was actually the same move as his “Withering Snow of the West Wind”…</p><p>No!</p><p>It’s the stronger version!</p><p>His body disappeared and reappeared.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked as if he was unmoved.</p><p>However, with his powerful “Sword Technique Expertise”, he was able to find a tiny gap at the critical moment, allowing the intangible sword energy to pass through his body.</p><p>He was indirectly immune to damage!</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>However, a muffled sound came from the distance behind him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned his head in shock and saw a scene that he would never forget in his entire life.</p><p>He could only see the shadow of the mountain that was buried within the clouds and fog. He did not know how many tens of thousands of miles away the mountain was. At this moment, it was as if a painter had added a stroke of color to it.</p><p>A straight horizontal line cut across. Smoke and dust billowed like the clamor of a volcano before it erupted.</p><p>The mountain range was actually broken!</p><p>From the west to the east, it was difficult for the naked eye to see where the boundary was. However, under this sword, the mountain range was cut up and down…</p><p>And it broke!</p><p>A sword cut through the peak, and the strength penetrated through the sky!</p><p>“Oh my God…”</p><p>“This is the Sword Deity?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had seen a god!</p><p>How was he a human?</p><p>He was a celestial being!!</p><p>If he had not seen it with his own eyes, he would have thought that he was dreaming. It was so ridiculous that it made people laugh and daydream.</p><p>But it was true.</p><p>The dream had actually happened. It was right in front of him, thousands of miles away.</p><p>The scene that should have been far-fetched was now shocking.</p><p>One could imagine how big the commotion that happened thousands of miles away was.</p><p>It was even more terrifying than a volcanic eruption!</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not hide it anymore. He felt that if he did not say anything, he would not have the chance to say anything.</p><p>But…</p><p>He did have a weakness.</p><p>That weakness was Gou Wuyue’s disciple, Lu Ke, who was still frozen in the Abrogated Origin Residence’s refrigerator.</p><p>But now, did he dare to bring it up? Did he dare to say it?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s legs and stomach were trembling.</p><p>He had seen the true Higher Void, the true power of the Sword Deity.</p><p>A true almighty who was not suppressed by the small world’s space and was one of the world order makers, so he did not have any scruples about making a move.</p><p>The damage done by the sword had really refreshed his worldview on the peak of combat strength.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou swallowed his saliva, but he stuttered twice.</p><p>His fingers trembled a few times, and he felt that his clothes could no longer cover the sweat under his armpits. Something was dripping down.</p><p>Could he really bring up the Lu Ke-shaped ice sculpture?</p><p>Could he say it out loud?</p><p>Could these be considered as “leverage”?</p><p>Will Gou Wuyue be afraid of threats?</p><p>“Hu~”</p><p>With mixed feelings in his heart, Xu Xiaoshou closed his eyes heavily.</p><p>God, where are you? Please hurry over and save me!</p><p>I can kowtow ahhh!!!</p><p>Please save me —</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
