He directly absorbed the power of the Fourth Sword of devil invasion into his body.</p><p>“He swallowed it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>This was the first non-ancient swordsman who was not affected by the Fourth Sword?</p><p>“Sizzle”</p><p>As if he had eaten his fill, Aje’s chest slightly swelled.</p><p>In the next second, an earthy yellow aura rose from the soles of his feet.</p><p>“The Power of the Higher Void?”</p><p>The Storyteller was shocked.</p><p>At this moment, he even directly abandoned Wen Ming’s existence.</p><p>The Power of the Higher Void was nothing for a peak-stage Cutting Path cultivator who had yet to overcome the first tribulation of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity, the Night Guardian.</p><p>How could such a divine puppet, who didn’t even have the battle awareness of a second level cultivator, have the Power of the Higher Void now?</p><p>“I’m the one who said that the book isn’t worthy?”</p><p>..</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost jumped three feet high in surprise when he saw this earthy yellow aura.</p><p>So that’s how it was!</p><p>So, Aje’s Power of the Higher Void could only be squeezed out like milk when he was full and had the strength?</p><p>Then, back at the City Lord Mansion…</p><p>It had relied on the continuous absorption of heaven and earth spiritual energy, as well as the energy produced after it transformed into a berserk giant.</p><p>The Power of the Higher Void that it had accumulated continuously?</p><p>“This is easy!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was immediately relieved.</p><p>The Power of the Higher Void was easy to maintain?</p><p>“Ma Ma?”</p><p>In the dark, Aje felt the disappearing Ma Ma calling to it.</p><p>It turned its head.</p><p>From an unknown place in the void, a black light shot over.</p><p>“Aje, receive the sword!”</p><p>The voice that had disappeared could not be heard, but Aje subconsciously raised his hand.</p><p>“TA.”</p><p>Fourth Sword steadily fell into Aje’s grasp.</p><p>With a sizzle, the demonic power instantly surged out.</p><p>But in the next second, it was absorbed into Aje’s body without missing a single cent.</p><p>The Power of the Higher Void beneath his feet was growing and strengthening at a visible speed!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The Storyteller, who was not far away, was stunned.</p><p>Divine puppet and Fourth Sword?</p><p>“Suspected, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>Aje clenched his vicious sword, and an endless amount of power surged out of his body.</p><p>He subconsciously waved his hand.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The space several miles behind the Storyteller collapsed.</p><p>Then, a black aura slowly seeped out of the void.</p><p>“This speed…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded.</p><p>With just this wave, he couldn’t even catch the disappearance of the sword energy.</p><p>It exploded a few miles away?</p><p>“That’s not right!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly realized that this space should have been banished by the storyteller.</p><p>In other words, the power of the Fourth Sword under Aje’s control was enough to break this confinement?</p><p>“Well done!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but praise in his heart.</p><p>But in the next second, his expression froze.</p><p>The Storyteller, who was also in a daze, suddenly burst into blood flow on his left shoulder. Then, his entire arm broke, and blood dripped down.</p><p>“Injured?”</p><p>At this moment, even the Storyteller himself showed an expression of disbelief, and he slowly lowered his eyebrows to look.</p><p>It was broken!</p><p>It was really broken!</p><p>Aje unceremoniously slashed down. The Storyteller’s shoulder was really broken!</p><p>The folded space bounced back.</p><p>But last time, the Storyteller was able to use this move to avoid Aje’s attack.</p><p>This time, it was completely ineffective.</p><p>“Is it because of… the Power of the Higher Void?”</p><p>Sensing the faint earthy yellow aura where the shoulder was broken, the Storyteller understood everything. His eyes instantly darkened.</p><p>Luo Leilei landed at the back. The sword energy moved in the same direction as Luo Leilei, almost cutting into her.</p><p>Fortunately, it was indeed a bit off, and the speed of the sword energy was also very fast.</p><p>Thus, there wasn’t much of the ferocious demonic power left along the way.</p><p>Thus, Luo Leilei wasn’t injured.</p><p>But seeing the injuries of the Storyteller, the shock in her soul wasn’t even as much as the fear she felt when she almost died on the spot.</p><p>“Senior Storyteller, you were injured by a slash?”</p><p>“Suspected, passive points + 1.”</p><p>..</p><p>“Good… Good!”</p><p>The Storyteller’s silent gaze suddenly exploded with light after a few breaths.</p><p>He muttered unconsciously.</p><p>When he raised his eyes to look at Aje again, his eyes were already filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>“What a divine puppet, you can even take the Fourth Sword and the Power of the Higher Void… What breed is this, Dao Qiongcang’s newly developed pet?”</p><p>“Why are you in Wen Ming’s hands?”</p><p>Raising his eyes to look at the void, the Storyteller seemed to be questioning Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>However, after Aje absorbed some energy, he completely adapted to the feeling of having the Fourth Sword in his hands.</p><p>With a few sword strokes… it was as if he was using his arms and fingers.</p><p>“Ma Ma.”</p><p>With a swish, its sound disappeared.</p><p>The old tune was repeated. When it appeared again, it had already landed behind the Storyteller.</p><p>But this time, the Storyteller did not have the courage to forcefully receive Aje’s attack.</p><p>“Yin Yang Life and Death Trap, seal!”</p><p>With a flip of his hand, he flipped open the ancient book in his hand.</p><p>With a single word, the space in front of Aje suddenly shook, as if it was about to turn into a piece of paper, falling down gracefully.</p><p>But what followed closely.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>With a wave of the Fourth Sword, the ancient book’s space was directly broken.</p><p>The crystal-clear space fragments dissipated and fell down.</p><p>After Aje’s sword strike, another sword strike struck towards the direction of the Storyteller.</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>The Storyteller did not even understand why he had suddenly lost control of his emotions.</p><p>However, as soon as he finished speaking, it was like Rolling Thunder.</p><p>Aje, who was charging towards him from the sky, was directly repelled by the hieroglyphs that appeared on the Yin Yang Life and Death Trap.</p><p>The Power of the Higher Void covered Aje’s entire body, but Aje was not sent flying very far away.</p><p>His body shook, and he broke free from the Way of the Heavens power.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>In an instant, another black shadow flashed across the sky.</p><p>The Storyteller rolled on the ground in a sorry state, barely avoiding the sword energy of the demon.</p><p>“Boom.”</p><p>Another space in the distance exploded.</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>A red light flashed in Ah Jie’s eyes. He had tasted the joy of a long-range battle.</p><p>“SWISH SWISH SWISH…”</p><p>His arm turned into an afterimage, and in an instant, countless black sword energy shot out.</p><p>This time, even Xu Xiaoshou and Luo Leilei, who were watching from the side, felt their scalps go numb.</p><p>It was too terrifying!</p><p>The Power of the Higher Void, the power of the Sovereign Physique, and the extremely fast devil sword. Even one of them might not be something an ordinary sovereign could contend against.</p><p>But now..</p><p>There were countless of them!</p><p>“Boom Boom Boom Boom…”</p><p>The surrounding space was like a firecracker, easily detonated by the black explosion.</p><p>The majestic power of the devil churned in the air, dyeing this place into a pitch-black ink pool.</p><p>“Well done!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not even have the time to look at the injuries of the Storyteller.</p><p>He took a step forward, directly stepping out of the space that the storyteller had banished.</p><p>The scene in front of him blurred.</p><p>It was pitch black..</p><p>Even the earth, the rocks, the dust… everything that could prove the existence of the world was gone.</p><p>All that was left was pitch black.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was confused.</p><p>The area outside the red-dressed pervert’s banished place was also the space of the White Cave.</p><p>“Why is the scenery completely different now that we’re out of this banished place?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s body stiffened. He felt that the scene in front of him seemed familiar.</p><p>The next second, he suddenly came to a realization.</p><p>“Ancient book space!”</p><p>This was an ancient book space that even the Storyteller did not have the time to duplicate!</p><p>Therefore, after leaving the banished lands, everything around him was pitch-black.</p><p>It was as if chaos had never been born.</p><p>Even the world had not been opened. Where did the light come from? Where did the entity come from?</p><p>He placed his spiritual senses on the information bar.</p><p>As expected.</p><p>“Imprisoned, passive points + 1.”</p><p>Imprisoned!</p><p>But..</p><p>“When did this happen?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou panicked.</p><p>He did not expect the Storyteller to be so powerful.</p><p>He could actually unwittingly imprison himself and Aje into the space of his ancient book again.</p><p>It was simply impossible to guard against!</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>Aje, who was scattering the devil sword with the Fourth Sword, also realized that something was wrong.</p><p>It seemed to have lost its target?</p><p>The human in the Red Dress, who had been dodging the sword energy and was in a sorry state, suddenly disappeared?</p><p>Was he gone just like that?</p><p>“Ma Ma?”Aje looked over in confusion.</p><p>“Aje, don’t do anything rash. Get close to me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t wait any longer and took a step closer to Aje’s side.</p><p>If they separated now, they would be waiting for death.</p><p>But how could they break this space of the ancient book?</p><p>“Suck…”</p><p>While he was still racking his brain, a strange sound suddenly came from his side.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but turn his head and saw that Aje had already put away the Fourth Sword and was hanging upside down on his back.</p><p>The Power of the Higher Void on the other hand was being sucked into his stomach along with the power of the demon, and it had solidified to the point that it was about to undergo a qualitative change.</p><p>“Ma Ma!”</p><p>A punch was thrown out.</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>The space was instantly covered with spider webs, and the entire world shook, and then collapsed with a loud bang.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>Aje also realized that he was being imprisoned, so he broke this space with one punch?</p><p>One punch? !</p><p>His heart shrank, as if he was facing a great enemy.</p><p>As expected, the world collapsed. What he was about to face was the spatial fragment, which was the Storyteller.</p><p>However, the predicted spatial fragment did not appear.</p><p>The space in front of him collapsed.</p><p>When the image appeared again, it was actually a White Cave world that was even more complete than before.</p><p>However, it was still incomplete!</p><p>“It’s still in the ancient book’s space?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was in a frenzy.</p><p>He looked at the information bar.</p><p>“Imprisoned, passive points + 1.”</p><p>As expected!</p><p>Nested space!</p><p>This perverted man in a red dress was too terrifying.</p><p>Fighting and fighting, yet he directly put himself out of the battlefield?</p><p>If the enemy wasn’t paying attention, he would probably use all his strength and finally scatter all his energy into the air!</p><p>“This is too disgusting. How can there be such a spiritual technique?”</p><p>Seeing Aje raise his fist again, Xu Xiaoshou held it with one hand and stopped it from moving.</p><p>“It’s useless.”</p><p>“If there’s one, there’ll be two.”</p><p>“If this space is shattered, there’s still another space.”</p><p>“I don’t know if the Storyteller’s ability will be exhausted, but…”</p><p>Glancing at the faint devil vein that appeared on Aje’s body, Xu Xiaoshou knew that with the Fourth Sword, not everyone could easily grasp it.</p><p>Even if Aje could absorb devilish energy, there must be a limit.</p><p>If he really passed this.</p><p>The situation would probably take a turn for the worse!</p><p>“Ding Ling Ding Ling…”</p><p>The compressed energy light in his hand leaked out a little of its aura.</p><p>“Ka Ka!”</p><p>The ground beneath Xu Xiaoshou’s feet was instantly frozen by ice.</p><p>The ice crystals spread out, instantly freezing the area within a radius of tens of miles.</p><p>Just like the last time, he found the space node… Xu Xiaoshou was methodical.</p><p>A lesson learned from the past, a lesson learned from the future.</p><p>The first time he was confined by the spatial confinement of the ancient book, his method of array shattering was very special. It was to sense the world of the White Cave.</p><p>Using the world as a furnace, he burned everything, broke everything, and finally returned to the White Cave.</p><p>Similarly.</p><p>At this moment, no matter how many layers the Storyteller’s space was nested within.</p><p>Within a certain space, there would always be a space node that could lead directly to the White Cave.</p><p>As long as it was found, Aje would be able to resolve the situation with a single punch.</p><p>“I’m counting on you.”</p><p>In his palm, the power of the Three Days Frozen Calamity surged out. Following the Order of the Heavens, it began to search for the world of the White Cave that it was familiar with.</p><p>As for the other part of the infernal energy, it was being compressed by Xu Xiaoshou, continuously condensing, condensing, and condensing!</p><p>“Weng!”</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the ice-type element of heaven and earth suddenly surged into a certain node.</p><p>“That’s it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up, and he directly viewed this space as the outer wall of the alchemy cauldron, refining the world of White Cave.</p><p>“Aje!”</p><p>The infernal condensing method of Infernal Heavens didn’t require much effort.</p><p>With a shout.</p><p>Aje raised his fist that was filled with the Power of the Higher Void, and transformed it into the final step of condensing the pill, suddenly swinging it towards the space node.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>When the world collapsed, a black hole appeared, and the spatial fragment filled everything.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stepped on the ground and transformed into a berserk giant. He directly picked up Aje and rushed into the space node.</p><p>“You want to trap me, Xu Xiaoshou? No way!”</p><p>..</p><p>White Cave.</p><p>“Senior Storyteller…”</p><p>Luo Leilei landed beside the Storyteller. Looking at the spot where his arm was broken, black and earthy yellow auras mixed together, she couldn’t help but worry.</p><p>“It’s fine.”</p><p>The Storyteller gritted his teeth in pain, but he was also using the Power of the Heavens power bit by bit to destroy the Power of the Higher Void and the sword will.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>The injuries that could have healed in the blink of an eye became very complicated because of these two troublesome powers.</p><p>But..</p><p>“It’s in.”</p><p>The Storyteller grinned, his eyes full of happiness.</p><p>Little Wen Ming was too powerful!</p><p>The divine puppet he summoned and the Fourth Sword had combat strength that was not something he could imagine.</p><p>He had been careless, but he had brought this upon himself.</p><p>However, the result was not bad.</p><p>“Divine puppet…”</p><p>The Storyteller who had interacted with white-clothed knew how terrifying this thing was. It was almost comparable to the higher void.</p><p>“Little Wen Ming’s divine puppet is a little strange.”</p><p>“But why does it feel like its initial combat strength isn’t enough?”</p><p>The Storyteller frowned and pondered.</p><p>Whether it was in terms of size, combat strength, or reaction speed..</p><p>That cute little boy was much weaker than the monotonous war machine that he had encountered in the past.</p><p>“There is actually a divine puppet that only has the battle awareness of the first realm. Is this still called a divine puppet?”</p><p>It was a little hard to figure out.</p><p>But the Storyteller did not care.</p><p>Everything would be revealed when he showed it to his brother.</p><p>“Yes, I can see it.”</p><p>“But Little Wen Ming is already mine.”</p><p>After weighing the Yin Yang Life and Death Trap in his hand, the Storyteller’s red lips lifted and he smiled in satisfaction.</p><p>“Yo!”</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>The surrounding space suddenly turned completely dark, as if it had turned into the beginning of chaos. There was no more light.</p><p>Following closely behind, a red-robed faintly flew over with the only white light in the darkness.</p><p>“The Power of the Higher Void again?”</p><p>The Storyteller felt the power of the person who came, and his smile instantly froze.</p><p>“Injured?”</p><p>The Night Guardian, who was dressed in a brand new red coat, could not help but smile when he saw the wound on the Storyteller’s arm.</p><p>If it were any other time, he would not even dare to believe that the Saint Servant, the Storyteller, would be beaten to such a miserable state.</p><p>However, thinking about it with his toes, he knew that the masterpiece of all this must have come from that young man who could not be reasoned with.</p><p>“Where’s Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>The Night Guardian’s grand vital energy landed several feet away from the storyteller. He frowned and said, “He ran away?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
