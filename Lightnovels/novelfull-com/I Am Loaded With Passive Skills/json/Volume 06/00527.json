He slowed down and found a hidden place to hide.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what happened? Are you afraid?”</p><p>Mu Zixi jumped down from her Senior Brother’s embrace with a red face.</p><p>If possible, she actually hoped that her Senior Brother’s panic could last for a few more days.</p><p>“Afraid?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou panted heavily and sneered disdainfully, “Do I, Xu Xiaoshou, look like a person who would be afraid?”</p><p>You look like you’re even more afraid of ghosts than when you met your master. That’s not being afraid?</p><p>“Hehe.”</p><p>“Doubted, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Ridiculed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glared at his Junior Sister and didn’t say anything else.</p><p>Even after flying for such a long distance, he was still unable to calm himself down.</p><p>This wave of Red Coats was also the impact of the ghost beasts. It was simply too strong.</p><p>But if that was all there was to it…</p><p>No matter how much he didn’t believe it, Xu Xiaoshou could still give himself an explanation that there was a one in 10,000 chance that it really happened.</p><p>In short, it was a coincidence.</p><p>But Yu Zhiwen’s reaction and performance…</p><p>“It can’t be a coincidence.”</p><p>“There must be some unspeakable secret hidden within this.”</p><p>“Perhaps, the number one organization of the continent, the Holy Divine Palace…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts were sluggish, and he didn’t dare to think about it anymore.</p><p>Even though he had doubts in his heart, it was undeniable that the existence of the Holy Divine Palace had saved this continent a lot of trouble and suffering.</p><p>The number one organization of the continent indeed didn’t need to do such unrighteous things in the name of “justice”.</p><p>Even if they really wanted to do it, it didn’t seem necessary.</p><p>They were already the number one faction on the continent. What else was there to be afraid of? Why would they need to do such things in secret?</p><p>But if it wasn’t like this, what was the point of hiding a ghost beast in a Red Coat?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paused for a moment before his thoughts came back to him.</p><p>“Maybe it was just a bad apple that spoilt the whole basket of apples?”</p><p>He was not sure.</p><p>But at the moment, he could only make this deduction.</p><p>It was not advisable to generalize.</p><p>With the lack of information, the only thing he could believe was that there was something wrong in the Holy Divine Palace, and someone was trying to do something in secret.</p><p>“But, how was this not discovered? It was such an obvious thing…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated for a while and ended his deduction.</p><p>These things didn’t seem to be something that a person of his level could guess.</p><p>Elder Sang was right.</p><p>Before one had the strength, it was enough to be a serious chess piece.</p><p>“Junior Sister.”</p><p>Turning around, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to be careless. He asked with a serious expression, “Do you know about ghost beasts?”</p><p>“Uh-huh.”</p><p>Mu Zixi grabbed her twin ponytails and nodded. “Isn’t Senior Sister Mo one of them?”</p><p>“Yes, she is.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded and said, “But I realized that things have started to go wrong. There are too many ghost beasts around me.”</p><p>“So?” Mu Zixi’s eyes widened.</p><p>“I’m very worried.”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“That’s it?”</p><p>“More than that.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated for a moment before sighing. “Do you know that right now, I only have you left?”</p><p>“Uh.”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s face turned red as she subconsciously crossed her arms across her chest.</p><p>She looked left and right and realized that even though there wasn’t much shelter in this place, it was indeed a desolate and uninhabited area. Hence, she slowly lowered her arms.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Mu Zixi answered softly like a mosquito. She said weakly, “So, what do you want to do…”</p><p>With a click, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly put his hands on his Junior Sister’s shoulders in excitement.</p><p>“Okay”</p><p>“Resisted, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Hated On, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Encouraged, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Mu Zixi raised her head shyly. There was a hint of anticipation in her eyes, but more than that, she was nervous.</p><p>“Hmm?” A nasal voice sounded.</p><p>“I have a very serious question to ask you!” Xu Xiaoshou’s body started to tremble.</p><p>“Hmm, you, you ask…”</p><p>Mu Zixi tried her best not to let go of this precious opportunity.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen left and Xu Xiaoshou was injured.</p><p>Now, it was a good opportunity for her to take advantage of… bah, to comfort him.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gulped. With a burning gaze, he said in a serious voice, “Are you a ghost beast?!”</p><p>“I am willing… huh?”</p><p>Mu Zixi answered at the speed of light. Halfway through her words, her mind suddenly went blank.</p><p>“What, what did you say?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression was solemn as he said word by word, “I’m asking you, are you a ghost beast or not!”</p><p>“Ghost your head!”</p><p>Mu Zixi suddenly jumped up in anger as her head hit the top of Xu Xiaoshou’s head.</p><p>The next second, she let out an “ah-ah”. After curling up, she covered her fingers and squatted to the side to let out a cold breath.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>“What the hell?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment. “What are you acting crazy for? I just wanted to ask you a question. If you don’t want to answer, then forget it. Why are you hurting yourself?”</p><p>“Me!” Mu Zixi choked for a moment.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>“Answer me.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also chose to squat down and asked seriously, “As your Senior Brother, I want to know about your previous situation, but you’re almost an adult, so it’s reasonable for you to have your own secrets.”</p><p>“But now, the situation is not right. I have to get it clear, or else…”</p><p>“Or else what?” Mu Zixi glared at him. “I won’t say it. Xu Xiaoshou, what can you do to me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was silent for a moment before he stood up and said, “Then we can only go our separate ways.”</p><p>As he said that, he walked back without looking back.</p><p>“Hey, hey, hey!”</p><p>Mu Zixi immediately panicked.</p><p>She felt that this scene was so familiar.</p><p>Wasn’t this the reason why Xu Xiaoshou left Yu Zhiwen just now?</p><p>Could it be that he really thought that she was a ghost beast, just like Lu Ke?</p><p>“I’m not a ghost beast!” Mu Zixi shouted.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stopped and turned around. “I also think that you’re not a ghost beast, but if you don’t explain clearly, I’m afraid…”</p><p>He didn’t dare to continue.</p><p>Mu Zixi’s growth speed was very fast.</p><p>She wasn’t even inferior to him at all.</p><p>No, it should be said that she had completely surpassed him!</p><p>He had risked his life again and again, and with the addition of the Passive System, he had barely reached the peak of his cultivation along the way.</p><p>But Mu Zixi…</p><p>A fool who had nothing to do all day and who had some boring thoughts in her mind was actually in the Upper Spiritual Level!</p><p>The Upper Spiritual Level! Do you dare to believe it?</p><p>Under normal circumstances, if someone were to break through, they would at most be able to break through to the Origin Court State like Zhou Tianshen.</p><p>The Upper Spirit…</p><p>Ha! Xu Xiaoshou didn’t believe that his Junior Sister was a simple person.</p><p>Or rather, he felt that everything around him existed.</p><p>Other than himself being a normal person, the rest were all hidden cheats!</p><p>They either had extraordinary backgrounds or had shocking backgrounds.</p><p>As for the rest, other than the ghost beast host body, what explanation could there be?</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s small face was conflicted. She crossed her fingers and hesitated for a moment before saying, “I’m really not a ghost beast.”</p><p>With a slap, Xu Xiaoshou turned around and left.</p><p>Great! This time, even his Junior Sister couldn’t be trusted.</p><p>As expected, there would never be a free pie in the world.</p><p>This life that he had obtained so cheaply was destined to be lonely and forlorn. He wouldn’t be able to have a true friend along the way, right?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, stop right there!”</p><p>Mu Zixi shouted from behind. A resolute look flashed across her face. “I’ll tell you!”</p><p>With a smack, Xu Xiaoshou stopped again.</p><p>He turned around and was about to ask a question.</p><p>Mu Zixi suddenly said angrily, “Shut up!”</p><p>He glanced at the information pane. After being scolded, there was actually no reaction?</p><p>“Good! Junior Sister, you’re getting bolder, aren’t you? How dare you talk to me like that?” Xu Xiaoshou was also furious.</p><p>“Uh.”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s expression turned awkward. “I wasn’t talking to you just now.”</p><p>“There are only the two of us here. Weren’t you talking to me? Are you talking to ghosts?” Xu Xiaoshou sneered.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Mu Zixi actually nodded. “There’s a ghost in my body. This is my secret.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned on the spot.</p><p>“Ghost beast?”</p><p>“Darn… You’re really lying to me!”</p><p>He subconsciously took a step back, ready to turn around and run at any time.</p><p>“Aiya, it’s not a ghost beast…”</p><p>Mu Zixi was irritated.</p><p>She was about to explain something when she suddenly became schizophrenic again. She scolded angrily, “Shut up, I didn’t let you speak!”</p><p>He looked at his Junior Sister and realized that he might have completely ignored this girl’s existence in the past because of his cultivation.</p><p>She was seriously ill!</p><p>“I’ll tell you my secret, and you have to tell me yours.” Mu Zixi held her small head. There seemed to be a pain in her eyes as if she was enduring some special pressure.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned.</p><p>Something was wrong, his Junior Sister was too strange.</p><p>“Can you tell me?”</p><p>He moved closer and could see that Mu Zixi’s pretty face was already covered in a fine sweat.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little flustered.</p><p>This casual question wouldn’t explode into a shocking melon, right?</p><p>He smeared some honey on the girl’s lips.</p><p>Seeing that there was no reaction, he hesitated for a moment before lightly letting out a breath.</p><p>“Ha!”</p><p>A rich aura of life instantly seeped into Mu Zixi’s mouth and nose.</p><p>The little girl immediately clamped her calf and her body tensed up. Even her face was flushed red.</p><p>“No, don’t give it to me…”</p><p>“Resisted, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless when he heard this. “What’s wrong with you?”</p><p>Mu Zixi trembled for a long time before she completely digested the sweet life force.</p><p>She wiped the sweat off her forehead, closed her eyes, and opened them.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The air current rippled outwards.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils constricted.</p><p>He saw that his Junior Sister’s large eyes, which were just ordinary, were now filled with a black and white mist.</p><p>Because he was close enough, Xu Xiaoshou could even see the strange patterns that flowed between the strange pupils.</p><p>One was as gloomy as hell, and the devilish energy was surging.</p><p>Perhaps even the ultimate yin power of the ghost beast was not as horrifying as the devil’s eyes.</p><p>The other was the complete opposite, bright and righteous, and grand.</p><p>With just a glance, Xu Xiaoshou felt that his soul had been cleansed and purified, so ethereal that he almost ascended to immortality on the spot.</p><p>“What… is this?” Xu Xiaoshou forcefully pulled back his ethereal soul.</p><p>“God Devil Eyes!”</p><p>Mu Zixi opened this pair of God Devil Eyes, and her temperament completely changed.</p><p>The little girl from next door’s temperament completely disappeared.</p><p>On the contrary, with this aura that was both good and evil.</p><p>If she were to say that she was a Saint that walked out of a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood, Xu Xiaoshou would believe it!</p><p>“My secret is this pair of God Devil Eyes.”</p><p>Perhaps it was because she had opened the God Devil Eyes, but Mu Zixi’s tone had changed. It was a little indifferent and ethereal.</p><p>“I don’t know why either. Ever since I saw that blind man in the Spirit Palace, there seemed to be some special power awakening in my brain.”</p><p>“Then, another ‘me’ was born.”</p><p>“Me?” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes twitched.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Mu Zixi nodded. “It’s not very accurate to say ‘me’. Or to put it another way, another consciousness?”</p><p>He was silent for a while, and then he suddenly asked, “Do you remember what happened in the past?”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s pair of God Devil Eyes suddenly showed the usual surprise. “How do you know that I don’t know what happened in the past?”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment.</p><p>It can’t be, you really don’t know?</p><p>He continued to ask, “You mean that you really don’t remember what happened when you were young. Then, you were accidentally stimulated and began to awaken another consciousness?”</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes.”</p><p>With such a pair of magical God Devil Eyes,” Mu Zixi nodded her head like a chick pecking on rice, which was indescribably strange.</p><p>“That consciousness can talk to you?” Xu Xiaoshou continued to ask in disbelief.</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes.”</p><p>“Then… did she tell you that she was actually you? You were only born after she was stimulated and sealed herself when she was young?” Xu Xiaoshou’s voice gradually weakened.</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes.”</p><p>“How did you know?”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s eyes lit up.</p><p>She felt that Xu Xiaoshou was a god. How could he know everything? He was so amazing!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you can even predict the future?”</p><p>In her heart, her Senior Brother had been inexplicably molded into a mysterious existence that no one in the world could compare to.</p><p>At this moment, having a method to predict the future was nothing out of the ordinary.</p><p>After all, this was Xu Xiaoshou’s normal state.</p><p>“I’m not a Doctor…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not continue.</p><p>He was not a doctor, but when he looked at this matter from a medical point of view that surpassed the current world…</p><p>“This is definitely schizophrenia. Why does he need to predict the future?”</p><p>He took a deep breath.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou truly felt that his previous speculation was not wrong.</p><p>There wasn’t a single normal person around him!</p><p>“Eyes, God Devil Eyes…”</p><p>He looked at Mu Zixi’s eyes and said absent-mindedly, “So, that little monk chased you because he felt the devilish energy in your eye and wanted to purify it?”</p><p>He pointed at his Junior Sister’s devil eye.</p><p>“I think so?”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s expression returned to indifference.</p><p>“I’m not used to it, this little girl!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his teeth ache as he looked at her. What was going on?</p><p>Schizophrenia?</p><p>Second personality?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know much about such illnesses.</p><p>The only thing he could rejoice about was that his Junior Sister’s condition didn’t seem too serious. She wouldn’t unconsciously switch her personality.</p><p>But… having a second personality seemed to be a very difficult thing in itself, okay?</p><p>“Exciting?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fell silent and muttered absent-mindedly.</p><p>He had a vague feeling that he had seen this pair of eyes somewhere, and it wasn’t unfamiliar.</p><p>It was very difficult to forget the scenes that his Perception had seen before.</p><p>But it had been too long, and Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t remember it for a while.</p><p>It wasn’t until he recalled the “blind man” that his Junior Sister had mentioned just now…</p><p>“Lei Shuangxing?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou who was in shock, blurted out, “You mean, you only awakened the second… er, another consciousness after seeing that blind man?”</p><p>“Seems to be?”</p><p>Mu Zixi herself wasn’t sure.</p><p>“That’s right!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils suddenly constricted.</p><p>He remembered!</p><p>When Ye Xiaotian was fighting against Lei Shuangxing, the latter seemed to have used a strange spiritual technique and directly controlled the Dean.</p><p>And when the Dean was controlled, didn’t the same thing appear in his eyes as Mu Zixi’s?</p><p>“What the heck!”</p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Xiaoshou was immediately terrified.</p><p>“Mu Zixi, you’re not a ghost beast, but you’re actually a Saint Servant?!”</p><p>He took a few steps back. The panic in his heart was much more than when he saw Lu Ke transform into a ghost beast host body.</p><p>“Saint Servant?”</p><p>Mu Zixi blinked, and her God Devil Eyes disappeared.</p><p>She rubbed her slightly dry eyes and said in confusion, “Xu Xiaoshou, what nonsense are you talking about? How can I be a Saint Servant?”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>Mu Zixi was not a Saint Servant.</p><p>However, her second consciousness and the memory that she had lost, what identity did she have.</p><p>This was probably an even more shocking secret.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing…</p><p>A pair of eyes that were exactly the same as Lei Shuangxing of a Saint Servant. Was this not enough to prove something?</p><p>“That’s not right!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly woke up.</p><p>If Lei Shuangxing was blind and Mu Zixi had the same pair of eyes as him.</p><p>“Darn, were your eyes dug out?”</p><p>“So you’re the one who is Tuan Zang?”</p><p>She was stunned for quite a while before she realized that Xu Xiaoshou was talking about Lei Shuangxing.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, are you crazy?!”</p><p>“How can I dig out someone’s eyes? Besides, if I dig them out, how would I be able to catch them… bah, do I even have the strength to dig them out?” Mu Zixi said angrily.</p><p>“Insulted, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Belittled, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was terrified.</p><p>Miss, you don’t have the strength, but who knows what kind of existence your so-called second personality would be.</p><p>You don’t know how to dig, but others might!</p><p>“Can you communicate with ‘her’?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried to ask.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Mu Zixi shook her head straightforwardly. “Only when she’s in a good mood will she appear in my mind. I won’t be able to find her.”</p><p>“Why don’t you try scolding her?” Xu Xiaoshou advised.</p><p>Her eyes went blank for a moment before she suddenly covered her head and let out an “ugh” sound.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you tricked me!”</p><p>This time, he didn’t know what to ask.</p><p>It was obvious that this second personality was also a proud existence.</p><p>Even when Mu Zixi wanted to tell him the truth, she was also warning Mu Zixi by harming her body.</p><p>However, compared to her second personality, his Junior Sister was obviously closer to him, as her Senior Brother.</p><p>Therefore, she chose to tell him without any hesitation.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou, who knew all of this, didn’t know what to do.</p><p>It was better not to ask!</p><p>It would be fine if he didn’t ask. All the strange things could be treated as the ghost beast host body.</p><p>This question posed an even bigger problem.</p><p>His Junior Sister could actually be related to the Saint Servant?</p><p>This… Xu Xiaoshou immediately had the following thoughts.</p><p>This was unsolvable!</p><p>How could he break this?</p><p>Should he leave in time and let this little girl bear all of this?</p><p>It seemed like a good choice… bah!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou slapped himself silently in his heart.</p><p>She was, after all, a Junior Sister who had been with him for such a long time. Although she would occasionally give him a large wave of curses, humans were not plants. Who could be heartless?</p><p>“Why don’t I run? We can talk about money, but talking about love hurts our lives…” he was wavering again.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, it’s my turn to ask you!”</p><p>While he was still indulging in his wild thoughts, Mu Zixi consciously finished explaining everything. She excitedly tiptoed and patted her Senior Brother’s shoulder.</p><p>“Ask away!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou replied numbly. He was still immersed in the thought of moving to another place to live and also getting out of Elder Sang’s control.</p><p>“Oh, what should I ask?”</p><p>Although she said that she wanted to ask something, Mu Zixi’s face was red. She seemed to be thinking about something difficult to ask.</p><p>However, she couldn’t ask and said, “Tell me your biggest secret!”</p><p>“Biggest?”</p><p>“Hmm…”</p><p>Looking at his Junior Sister’s calm expression, Xu Xiaoshou finally regained his senses.</p><p>No matter what happened in the future, he just had to take care of the present.</p><p>He began to think seriously.</p><p>“The biggest secret…”</p><p>The Passive System?</p><p>No, no, no. This couldn’t be said.</p><p>After a long time, he seemed to have made up his mind. Xu Xiaoshou looked around and after confirming that there was indeed no one around, he leaned over with a mysterious expression.</p><p>“What? What?” Mu Zixi was looking forward to it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held his Junior Sister’s ear and said, “Actually, I’m not from this world.”</p><p>She was stunned for a long while before she reacted.</p><p>Then, she suddenly jumped away and a huge wooden mallet materialized in her hand. She directly smashed it towards her Senior Brother’s head.</p><p>“Pa!”</p><p>The mallet shattered.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was in a daze for a moment.</p><p>“What are you doing!” He roared angrily.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you big liar. I’ve already shared my secret, and you’re saying this?” Mu Zixi was extremely angry. Two even bigger mallets flew out from her hands, chasing after Xu Xiaoshou and about to strike.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>“I’m telling the truth…”</p><p>“If you’re not human, are you a ghost?”</p><p>Mu Zixi glared at him, not listening at all. She pounced on him again.</p><p>“PA PA!”</p><p>“Beaten, Passive Points, +2.”</p><p>“Darn, your focus is really weird. Is my focus on ‘humans’? Are you crazy!” Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>“PA PA!”</p><p>“Beaten, Passive Points, +2.”</p><p>“Stop.”</p><p>“PA PA!”</p><p>“Beaten, Passive Points, +2.”</p><p>“Wait, there seems to be something up ahead?” Xu Xiaoshou braked.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, are you lying to me again?”</p><p>Mu Zixi didn’t fall for it at all. She used two hollow wooden mallets that had no lethality and directly slammed.</p><p>At this moment, a woman’s voice with a delicate smile suddenly drifted down from the sky.</p><p>“Yo, Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“I’ve finally found you. You still have the leisure to flirt in the White Cave, huh?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
