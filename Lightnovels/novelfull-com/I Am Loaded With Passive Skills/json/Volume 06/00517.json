It was a sight that was filled with traces of explosions.</p><p>No one had discovered him!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was slightly surprised.</p><p>He looked over and saw Xu Xiaoji curled up in a corner alone.</p><p>This fellow seemed to be in a particularly relaxed mood at the moment. He did not seem as stiff as usual. It was probably because he could not see Xu Xiaoshou’s existence.</p><p>He coiled his fingernails and muttered something.</p><p>However, it was a little far away. Xu Xiaoshou relied on his Perception to hear it vaguely. It sounded like babbling and it was too soft.</p><p>He was in high spirits, rushed directly into the face of Xu Xiaoji.</p><p>Usually, this guy looked like he’s seen a ghost when he saw Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>But now, he’s picking his fingernails like nobody’s watching!</p><p>“Yoo-hoo, did I completely vanish?”</p><p>“Can’t you feel it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was excited.</p><p>This feeling of doing something surreptitiously in broad daylight was particularly stimulating.</p><p>He turned his head and put his ear close to Xu Xiaoji’s mouth as if he was going to lie on top of him.</p><p>“Darn it, darn it…”</p><p>“How do I get out of here…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoji frowned, his eyes full of contemplation.</p><p>Hearing this, Xu Xiaoshou was amused.</p><p>What a guy.</p><p>It turned out that those who had nothing to do every day were thinking of sneaking out!</p><p>Ignoring this guy, Xu Xiaoshou turned around and floated behind the big rock.</p><p>“Little girl, what are you doing?”</p><p>Looking at his Junior Sister who was drenched in sweat and sprawled on the ground, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but ridicule her in his heart.</p><p>There was no battle happening here before!</p><p>Why did she look like she had exhausted herself?</p><p>“There’s something strange.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou floated to his Junior Sister’s side and squatted down. He glanced at the message board.</p><p>“Oh, you’re actually so obedient. There’s no cursing?”</p><p>He came back to his senses and looked at Mu Zixi.</p><p>He saw that this girl was holding her head with her small hands. Her eyes were half-rolled, and she looked like she had just survived a disaster.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>He couldn’t help but ask.</p><p>In the end, the other party didn’t respond.</p><p>Only then did Xu Xiaoshou suddenly realize that the disappearance of the Vanishing Technique was related to everything about himself.</p><p>This included the spatial fluctuation caused by him flying toward Xu Xiaoji or the sound of the wind.</p><p>It also included the sound that he was making at this moment.</p><p>“So, it would make my entire body disappear?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t shocked, but rather delighted.</p><p>Such a complete disappearance was truly too terrifying.</p><p>If he had the plan to become an assassin at this moment…</p><p>Looking at the defenseless little Junior Sister in front of him, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but shake his head.</p><p>Who could withstand this!</p><p>Whether it was stealing intelligence or wanting to kill someone, he could catch them with one shot!</p><p>“I won’t let you out.”</p><p>Mu Zixi suddenly muttered to herself, but her voice was filled with determination. “Xu Xiaoshou, I won’t give it to you!”</p><p>“Subjected to Contention, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Talking in her sleep? She must be crazy!</p><p>His mind suddenly went blank as he looked at the information that had just popped up.</p><p>“Competition?”</p><p>“That’s not right. There’s only Junior Sister here. Who is she fighting with?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows. He realized that with just this sentence, he seemed to have uncovered a little of Mu Zixi’s secret.</p><p>He wanted to guide the girl to continue speaking.</p><p>However, the Vanishing Technique was too thorough.</p><p>She couldn’t even hear him speak, so how could he guide her?</p><p>With a frown, Xu Xiaoshou watched as the girl stopped speaking. He could only helplessly let go of this matter.</p><p>He had already sensed that there was something wrong with his Junior Sister.</p><p>After that, the appearance of Monk Bu Le was very abrupt. However, the words “there is devilish energy on her body” verified his feeling. There was nothing wrong with his suspicions.</p><p>But at that time in the Spirit Palace, after his Junior Sister had a high fever, Xu Xiaoshou did ask the girl for the reason.</p><p>But since she refused to say, he didn’t force it.</p><p>“Very good. You are not growing up, but you are hiding a lot of little secrets!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had a sudden inspiration and shouted in his heart, “Partially vanish”.</p><p>In the next second, his idea came true.</p><p>In his Perception, a small finger appeared out of thin air.</p><p>Other than that, Xu Xiaoshou did not see any other parts of his body.</p><p>“Can that be done?”</p><p>He was amused.</p><p>So the Vanishing Technique was not only able to make him completely disappear, but he could use his own thoughts to control the parts of his body that he wanted to disappear?</p><p>In an instant, all the major strategies floated out of his mind.</p><p>The appearance of the Vanishing Technique was too timely.</p><p>This was simply an existence that could subvert his entire current combat system!</p><p>If it was combined with Ascending to the Heavens in A Single Step…</p><p>“Interesting!”</p><p>Suppressing the excitement in his heart, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t allow his thoughts to run wild. He focused his attention and seriously sized up his Junior Sister.</p><p>It seemed to be the first time he was so close to her. Moreover, he didn’t have any outsiders to disturb him, so he carefully scrutinized her.</p><p>“Tsk, she’s quite pretty!”</p><p>If she were to abandon her current image, Mu Zixi was indeed very pretty just by looking at her face.</p><p>Even though her twin ponytails drooped weakly on the ground and her bangs were drenched in sweat.</p><p>However, the face that was completely exposed was indeed very cute and delicate.</p><p>Her small face was slightly fleshy and her cheeks were pink and tender like two cherries. However, her chin was slightly pointed.</p><p>The combination of her facial features was also very exquisite.</p><p>Especially her pair of big eyes, Xu Xiaoshou felt ashamed.</p><p>Even though she was rolling her eyes at this moment, he could visualize how Mu Zixi would look if she matures.</p><p>“By the way, how old is this girl? Can she still grow?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought in amusement.</p><p>Suddenly, he stretched out his finger that had never disappeared and lightly poked his Junior Sister’s cheek.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Mu Zixi woke up on the spot and sat up straight.</p><p>She looked around but did not find anyone suspicious.</p><p>Confusion flashed through her eyes and the little girl immediately tidied up her hair.</p><p>She lowered her head and patted her bangs. She straightened her ponytail and the ponytail bounced slightly outwards.</p><p>After doing all this, she softly probed, “Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>There was no response.</p><p>The air was extremely quiet.</p><p>Mu Zixi immediately pouted, her eyes filled with hatred.</p><p>“Darn it, was it an illusion…”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>This little girl was imagining things. Why did you curse me?</p><p>How could you keep cursing me?</p><p>You must be so bored!</p><p>He couldn’t help but use a tactic. Four fingers appeared at the speed of light and pulled down the little girl’s twin ponytails.</p><p>“Aiyo!”</p><p>Mu Zixi immediately cried out in surprise. She turned around in disbelief, but there was still nothing.</p><p>“Rub rub rub rub.”</p><p>She was terrified and her butt rubbed against the ground as she retreated.</p><p>“Ghost?”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was so angry that his lungs hurt.</p><p>He wanted to continue teaching this girl a lesson, but suddenly, a gentle voice came from not far away.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen looked over, but besides the big rock, Mu Zixi was looking around suspiciously.</p><p>“There’s a ghost!”</p><p>“A ghost?” Yu Zhiwen was surprised.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Mu Zixi kept nodding and suddenly raised her voice, “Xu Xiaoshou, come out! Are you the one behind this?”</p><p>“Don’t think that I can’t tell just because you used an array to tease me!”</p><p>As she spoke, she suddenly tilted her head and asked in a low voice, “Is there an array?”</p><p>A funny look flashed across Yu Zhiwen’s eyes.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“That’s strange…”</p><p>Mu Zixi grabbed her twin ponytails and frowned. “Where’s Xu Xiaoshou? Has he come out yet?”</p><p>When Yu Zhiwen heard that, she swept her gaze in the direction where Xu Xiaoshou had buried himself alive.</p><p>“There’s no movement.”</p><p>“He should still be inside…”</p><p>Since Xu Xiaoshou wanted to cultivate on his own, she naturally wouldn’t use her spiritual senses to spy on others.</p><p>Not to mention that it might disturb others.</p><p>In the spirit cultivation world, it was already very impolite to use spiritual senses to spy on others’ secrets.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen would definitely not do that.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou watched as the two women returned to silence after their shock and doubt. They continued to cultivate and secretly laughed in his heart.</p><p>“This is too interesting!”</p><p>He sneakily bypassed Mu Zixi and arrived in front of Yu Zhiwen, who was sitting cross-legged.</p><p>Ever since the veil was removed, this girl seemed to have completely forgotten about this matter.</p><p>She was like a quiet lotus flower that bloomed alone. Even in this messy Yuan Mansion space, she was still beautiful by herself. She would not lose her image like Mu Zixi.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou squatted down and looked at this girl carefully.</p><p>“Tsk tsk, she’s pretty too.”</p><p>It was different from Mu Zixi’s feeling of a pretty young lady from a small family.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen gave people a temperament that was very intuitive and stunning.</p><p>Even if she closed her eyes to cultivate at this moment and covered her pair of star eyes that were enough to amaze the world.</p><p>Her beauty could cause the moon to hide and flowers to feel ashamed.</p><p>It was difficult for Xu Xiaoshou to come up with a very powerful adjective, but he felt that this should be the most beautiful girl he had ever seen.</p><p>Not only was her face beautiful, but her figure was also extremely slim.</p><p>“Try it?”</p><p>As the saying goes, one can steal a bell if one covers one’s ears, but one is bold if one closes one’s eyes.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind was stirred up. He also conjured a finger and poked the girl’s cheek.</p><p>However this time, he seemed to have gone overboard.</p><p>When his finger was close enough and he was just about to touch it.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen suddenly opened her eyes. Her pair of starry eyes shone, and then her pupils constricted.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>She looked ahead in a daze as if she was completely shocked. “When did you come out? Why didn’t I feel it?”</p><p>He sized himself up.</p><p>“You, you can see me?”</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>In his Perception, he could already see his squatting body.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>He probed his energy reserve.</p><p>It was empty!</p><p>No, it wasn’t empty. There was still a trace of spiritual source left.</p><p>However, this trace of spiritual source that was constantly growing was obviously nourished by the High Spirits after the energy reserve was completely empty.</p><p>In other words…</p><p>“As long as the Vanishing Technique is activated, it will continue to consume spiritual source?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>All of his previous passive skills had rarely involved the consumption of spiritual sources.</p><p>As a result, even if he had activated the Vanishing Technique, he didn’t think about it immediately.</p><p>But now, it seemed that he had indeed overlooked it.</p><p>Perhaps, strictly speaking, as long as the Berserk Giant and Exploding Posture were activated, they would continuously consume spiritual sources.</p><p>But the consumption of spiritual sources wasn’t continuous.</p><p>Hence, the existence of the High Spirits was replenished.</p><p>But the Vanishing Technique…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou completely understood.</p><p>This kind of awakening technique that continuously disappeared couldn’t even be sensed by Yu Zhiwen. In other words, it could even deceive the Way of the Heavens.</p><p>As long as he maintained his vanishing state, the consumption would definitely be huge!</p><p>“But isn’t this consumption too fast?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was secretly speechless.</p><p>He had only come out to play for a few minutes and his energy reserve had already been emptied.</p><p>At this time, if he were to peep, the amount of time to sustain his vanishing status wouldn’t even be enough for others to wash their head!</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen watched as Xu Xiaoshou froze in front of her and then started to daydream. She was stunned for a moment.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Not only did he suddenly appear, but this finger…</p><p>Her eyeballs rolled down as she looked at Xu Xiaoshou’s finger that was about to touch her face. For a moment, she felt that it was extremely funny!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s posture and actions were indeed comical!</p><p>It completely overturned his image as an invincible God of war in her heart once again.</p><p>It was fine for him to appear out of nowhere.</p><p>But you squatted in front of me in this posture and even stretched out a finger…</p><p>Are you trying to tease me?</p><p>A teasing look flashed across Yu Zhiwen’s eyes. She did not dodge and raised her chin slightly. “What are you doing?”</p><p>“Uh!”</p><p>The atmosphere immediately froze.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a headache coming on. He looked at his fingers.</p><p>He did not know whether to retract it or not.</p><p>He simply tapped on it directly. After poking her skin, he stopped as if nothing had happened.</p><p>“No, I saw that you were cultivating, so I’m here to bother you.” He chuckled.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s mind went blank.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou… how, how would he dare?</p><p>At this moment, her face turned red. Yu Zhiwen stood up at lightning speed and retreated.</p><p>“What are you doing!”</p><p>“Doubted, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou spread his hands and said inexplicably, “Didn’t I say that since you’re cultivating, I wanted to ask you if your cultivation is over?”</p><p>She pointed at Xu Xiaoshou’s hands. “Your hands…”</p><p>“What’s wrong with me?”</p><p>This lazy tone immediately angered Yu Zhiwen so much that she stomped her feet. “You clearly…”</p><p>She wanted to question him, but when the words came to her mouth, she suddenly couldn’t bring herself to say it.</p><p>How could she say it?</p><p>Say that you poked me?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen felt her head swell.</p><p>She couldn’t bring herself to say it!</p><p>“Have you finished your cultivation?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled and casually turned the page on this matter that might put him in an awkward situation.</p><p>“If you’ve finished your cultivation, then should we go back to the White Cave?”</p><p>“Every moment in the White Cave is worth a thousand gold. We can’t waste our time in the Yuan Mansion.”</p><p>“Shameless!” Yu Zhiwen’s pretty face hadn’t cooled down yet. It turned red again, and she immediately scolded and turned her head away.</p><p>“Insulted, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Behind the rock, Mu Zixi heard the commotion and hurriedly ended her recuperation.</p><p>After turning around and sticking her head out, she said with a fierce expression, “Xu Xiaoshou, was it you who played a trick just now?”</p><p>“No.” Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand repeatedly. “I didn’t pull your braids.”</p><p>Mu Zixi was so angry that she put her hands on her hips and jumped onto the rock. She wanted to curse a few words, but she didn’t know what to say.</p><p>Darn it Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>White Cave.</p><p>In a concealed spiritual array boundary, two groups of people were sitting down.</p><p>The bonfire was raging and was also divided into two groups.</p><p>One group had a few people, but there were only two people in the other group.</p><p>“Zi Zi…”</p><p>There was a burnt spiritual meat smell coming from the larger group, causing everyone to frown.</p><p>“Zhou Tianshen, are you sure you can do it?”</p><p>“No, don’t waste my food. It’s been so many days since I ate meat that I’m about to curse right now.”</p><p>A tall, rough-looking man stood up, his voice full of dissatisfaction.</p><p>“If you can do it, then go ahead. Why did you call me?”</p><p>Zhou Tianshen did not even raise his head.</p><p>Other people were afraid of him, Tan Ji, but Zhou Tianshen, was not.</p><p>“Are you asking for a beating?”</p><p>Tan Ji’s expression instantly turned cold. “Do you want me to loosen your bones again?”</p><p>“TSK!”</p><p>Zhou Tianshen sneered and slapped the golden broadsword on the ground. He laughed arrogantly and said, “To be honest, your strength is pretty good. I quite enjoy it.”</p><p>“You!”</p><p>Tan Ji’s expression instantly changed. He raised his fist and was about to rush out.</p><p>“Sit down!”</p><p>Rao Yinyin, who was standing at the side, finally couldn’t help but speak out.</p><p>At this moment, she felt a headache coming on. She completely didn’t understand why the Dean would let these people enter the White Cave.</p><p>Wasn’t this finding trouble?</p><p>And Zhou Tianshen…</p><p>You’re just like the others when you’re weak. Can’t you restrain yourself a little?</p><p>Why did you have to be so stubborn against this thorn? Aren’t you asking for trouble?</p><p>She knew that in the successive battles in the White Cave, Tan Ji had already caused many problems for Zhou Tianshen.</p><p>Although he had gone out to train himself for two years, this fellow’s personality had already become much more restrained than before.</p><p>But even so, he wasn’t someone that Zhou Tianshen and the others could deal with!</p><p>If not for the orders of the Dean, Rao Yinyin wouldn’t even have bothered with this person in front of her.</p><p>“Sit down!”</p><p>Seeing that Tan Ji had stopped in his tracks and was about to ignore her, Rao Yinyin spoke up once more, “Don’t forget, in the White Cave, you are under my control!”</p><p>“I am under your control?”</p><p>Tan Ji turned his head and sneered, “Woman, just like you, I am also the leader. What do you mean by I am under your control?”</p><p>“It is the order of the Dean. If you are unhappy, go and talk to him yourself. Let’s see how he will deal with you,” Rao Yinyin echoed lazily.</p><p>Seeing that this fellow still wanted to continue his actions, she immediately added, “If you are not afraid that I will snitch on you, then you can continue. In any case, I am too lazy to bother with the two of you.”</p><p>“But after we get out, I will report everything truthfully.”</p><p>Tan Ji clenched his fists.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>After glaring at Zhou Tianshen, he finally chose to stop.</p><p>“Arrogant my ass!”</p><p>“Just a lousy temporary leader. Taking advantage of Xu Xiaoshou’s absence, he slipped through the air and entered. He really thinks that he’s very powerful…”</p><p>Zhou Tianshen chuckled softly as he muttered to himself.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Tan Ji’s body, which had barely settled down, stood up after hearing that. His killing intent immediately exploded, causing the bonfire to dance wildly.</p><p>“You want to kill me?”</p><p>Zhou Tianshen directly threw the spirit beast meat into the fire seed. With one arm, he struck the ground heavily. With a knife in his hand, he also stood up.</p><p>The scene was on the verge of eruption.</p><p>Everyone was shivering.</p><p>Whether it was the new thirty-three or the old thirty-three groups of people, they were all a little dumbfounded at this moment.</p><p>This was too rigid!</p><p>How could Zhou Tianshen dare to do this?</p><p>Was he really not afraid of death?</p><p>“Sit down!”</p><p>Rao Yinyin’s eyes were sullen, and she also slammed the table and stood up. She glared at Zhou Tianshen and said, “You are full of nonsense. Can’t you grill the meat properly? Can’t you be mute?”</p><p>“Mute?”</p><p>Zhou Tianshen looked at the two opponents in front of him whose strength had completely surpassed his current cultivation level. Then, he thought of Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>“Others can do it, but I, Zhou Tianshen, can’t!”</p><p>He swung his broadsword horizontally and his aura soared into the sky.</p><p>“Dong!”</p><p>The next second, Rao Yinyin narrowed her eyes and swept her cold gaze across. This fellow fell limply to the ground.</p><p>“Sit down.”</p><p>Turning her head, Rao Yinyin spoke coldly to Tan Ji.</p><p>“Chi.”</p><p>“Consider yourself lucky.” Tan Ji snickered and returned to his seat.</p><p>However, looking at the spirit beast meat that was completely burnt by the bonfire, his anger couldn’t help but flare-up.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>After muttering softly, Tan Ji narrowed his cold eyes. No one knew what he was thinking about.</p><p>In the next second, he turned his head and took out another piece of spirit beast meat. He inserted the piece of meat into a wooden branch and passed it to a young lady dressed in a tight white dress. Then, he said passionately,</p><p>“Junior Sister Qianqian, why don’t you roast it?”</p><p>Su Qianqian looked at the piece of meat and her eyes shifted upwards.</p><p>Is this guy sick?</p><p>Does he not know about my relationship with Big Brother Shou?</p><p>“Sorry, I refuse.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
