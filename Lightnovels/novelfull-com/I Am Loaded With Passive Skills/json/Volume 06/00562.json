He was both amused and touched.</p><p>Lan Ling’s mind had indeed collapsed.</p><p>No one present could think straight.</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou was almost trapped by himself at this moment, let alone others.</p><p>Previously, when Yu Zhiwen betrayed him, he thought that he was doomed.</p><p>At the very least, with the information that Yu Zhiwen shared, it would be easy for Red-robed and the others to expose his identity.</p><p>But now.</p><p>Seeing the reaction of Night Guardian, Lan Ling, and the others, Xu Xiaoshou realized it.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen had guessed his identity, and even stood on the level of Red-robed and directly chose to expose him.</p><p>However, the way she exposed her identity only meant that Xu Xiaoshou might be here.</p><p>However, being here meant two things.</p><p>First, Xu Xiaoshou had another person hiding here.</p><p>Second, it was herself.</p><p>“But she didn’t explain in detail…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was secretly glad that he didn’t kill her in a hurry and instead kept her in the Yuan mansion.</p><p>Otherwise, the misunderstanding would be huge!</p><p>Judging from Lan Ling’s reaction, it wasn’t hard to guess that Yu Zhiwen wasn’t the only one who had doubted his identity.</p><p>It was even possible that Lan Ling’s speculations about him were even higher than Yu Zhiwen’s.</p><p>Under such circumstances, perhaps under normal circumstances, Yu Zhiwen chose to reveal her identity step by step. It was indeed possible for her to keep her secret.</p><p>However, there was a greater possibility that Lan Ling might not believe it in the end, or she might have chosen to do the experiment because she felt that she was lucky.</p><p>Then… Xu Xiaoshou knew that he would definitely not be able to accept the experiment.</p><p>However, Yu Zhiwen had chosen to do the opposite.</p><p>She had directly led the thoughts of the people in red-robed in the direction that she was the real Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>If she did that, it would indeed be very easy for her to attack in a fit of rage and directly nip the problem in the bud.</p><p>But she still dared!</p><p>She even dragged it to the last step. When the word “Run” was spoken, it caused Lan Ling’s entire mind to collapse from the root, causing her to lose even the courage to verify her identity.</p><p>It had to be said that this was really too extreme.</p><p>But..</p><p>“Why did she want to protect me?” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t understand.</p><p>The word “Run” was indeed true. At the last moment, Xu Xiaoshou also thought of this usage.</p><p>Using the “Transformation” to transform into Yu Zhiwen’s voice, in the White Flame’s burning barrier that could isolate spiritual senses, she burned the person to death. At the same time, her words destroyed Lan’s spiritual senses, causing her mind to completely collapse.</p><p>This was also Xu Xiaoshou’s method of self-rescue at the last moment.</p><p>There was no other way.</p><p>However, he never expected that before he could use the “Transformation” to make a sound, Yu Zhiwen had already shouldered the heavy pressure and shouted this sentence at him.</p><p>With a single “Run”, he could turn the tables and resolve the deadlock.</p><p>“But…”</p><p>“Why are you protecting me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could see Yu Zhiwen’s stance.</p><p>She was definitely a typical person of the Holy Divine Palace. It was impossible for her to protect her opponent, even though he had traveled with her for a few days.</p><p>But for such a small reason, she gave up on telling Red-robed the truth and chose to protect him?</p><p>If she couldn’t figure it out..</p><p>She might as well not think about it!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t have any more time to spend on Yu Zhiwen’s method.</p><p>Facing so many powerful enemies, he had to muster up all his energy.</p><p>After all, the show wasn’t over yet!</p><p>“I really didn’t expect that you guys would be so scared that you wouldn’t dare to make a move after directly burning the Holy Maiden of the Holy Divine Palace.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou only dared to mock her in his heart.</p><p>The plan where Red-robed would riot because of Yu Zhiwen’s death and break through the space of the ancient book didn’t happen at all.</p><p>Obviously, the word “Run” not only turned the situation around, it even made Red-robed cower a little.</p><p>So..</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the people around him and fixed his eyes on the furious Night Guardian. He smiled indifferently.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I don’t want to say anything more.”</p><p>“But!”</p><p>He changed the topic and teased, “The bet from before will not change because of the death of that little girl.”</p><p>“After all, I only took half of the debt.”</p><p>“You dare? !” Night Guardian instantly shouted angrily, but surprisingly, he did not go forward. Instead, he just shouted and stood still.</p><p>“Then… try?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t afraid.</p><p>He actually didn’t want to court death like this and provoke Red-robed at this critical moment.</p><p>But the show had already come to this point..</p><p>No, no way!</p><p>Swish.</p><p>His gaze swept across the red-robed crowd, and everyone felt their hearts turn cold.</p><p>At the last moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze focused on the youth who always fell behind red-robed in the arena, as if he had no sense of presence at all.</p><p>“Yu Zhiwen has nothing to do with you, so you can’t get angry.”.</p><p>“Then this guy should be able to do it, right?”?</p><p>“He has the secret of the Red-robed’s Ghost Beast and is also the disciple of the Wuyue Sword Deity — Lu Ke!”</p><p>“Lan Ling, it’s Xiao Ke!”</p><p>Xin realized that the eyes of the Saint Servant’s Second Brother were focused, and he was completely dumbfounded.</p><p>“Is this guy poisonous?”</p><p>“He doesn’t target anything, but the one with the most powerful background?”</p><p>Fortunately, no one knew that Xiao Ke was the disciple of the Wuyue Sword Deity.</p><p>Otherwise, the first target of the Second Brother of the Saint Servant would definitely be this kid!</p><p>“Protect Xiao Ke!”</p><p>Xin roared. At this time, his injuries had almost healed with the help of elixirs.</p><p>As long as it wasn’t an accident like before, he could still fight.</p><p>“Little guy, did you come here to train?” Xu Xiaoshou did not care and only stared at Lu Ke with a smile.</p><p>He could see that Red-robed might have a plan. Otherwise, she would not let him stare at her like that.</p><p>But, it was a good plan!</p><p>It would be best if she could help me blow up the space of the ancient book so that everyone could escape together. That would be the final stage.</p><p>“Hum –”</p><p>The famed sword Green Scale Ridge trembled violently as if it felt an absolute pressure.</p><p>However, even if it was like an indomitable swordsman who raised the famed sword high up in the air…</p><p>Lu Ke was so terrified that he couldn’t even make a sound.</p><p>This was a powerhouse of the same generation who had fought against his master!</p><p>If it was someone else, perhaps even stronger, Lu Ke felt that he could be indifferent.</p><p>But..</p><p>The contrast was so sudden.</p><p>His master, who was unattainable in his heart, and his opponent, had set their eyes on him!</p><p>“The second-in-command of the Saint Servant, does he not have any awareness of being a strong person? He only targets the weakest person to kill?” Lu Ke’s forehead was covered in sweat.</p><p>He did not know whether he should say that the old man had no grace or that he had a sharp eye.</p><p>“Hu ~”</p><p>A clear wind swept across the void.</p><p>The third time, the old man’s figure holding onto straw hat disappeared into thin air.</p><p>The Storyteller’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>This was already the third time he had seen this spiritual technique.</p><p>However, with his current realm, he could not see clearly how Second Brother had done it?</p><p>There was not even the slightest fluctuation of the way of the heavens.</p><p>Even the aura of the holy path was not sensed by the Storyteller at all.</p><p>What… was the Second Brother’s skill?</p><p>“Lan Ling!”</p><p>Night Guardian shouted. He could not stand still anymore and gave up on his plan. “Teleportation portal, follow me!”</p><p>With that said.</p><p>He kicked through the void. When he reappeared, he reached out from the spatial crack and grabbed Lu Ke’s stiff left shoulder.</p><p>“Pa.”</p><p>At the same time, the figure of the old man in straw hat appeared on the other side of Lu Ke. He also put one hand on Lu Ke’s right shoulder.</p><p>Both of them turned their heads at the same time and looked at each other on Lu Ke’s head.</p><p>The Night Guardian did not wait to make his move.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already retracted his surprised gaze from the spatial crack. He smiled and said, “So soon? You want this doll too?”</p><p>He paused for a moment and added, “Half for each person?”</p><p>With a click, Night Guardian was immediately stunned.</p><p>This thick style of flirtatious words..</p><p>At a certain moment, he even felt that he was not facing the legendary second-in-command of the saint servant, but that Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>But his mind was in a trance for a moment.</p><p>The Night Guardian realized that he was already one step too late.</p><p>He only heard a light sound by his ear.</p><p>The second-in-command of the Saint Servant had already turned his body sideways. He raised the Fourth Sword in his hand and slashed fiercely in his direction.</p><p>The huge force coming from Lu Ke’s body was also warning him that if Night Guardian really wanted to use force, the only result would be to tear Lu Ke apart and split him in half.</p><p>What made people even more desperate was that this dead old man with dark circles as thick as ink had actually not slashed in his own direction with the fourth sword.</p><p>Instead, it was Lu Ke’s left shoulder!</p><p>He wanted to pull Lu Ke over..</p><p>Not to mention that Lu Ke could not withstand the huge force tearing him apart.</p><p>If he really could withstand it, with such a side of his body, it would be enough for the fourth sword to strike Lu Ke’s right shoulder.</p><p>“Shameless!”</p><p>The Night Guardian was going crazy.</p><p>He had no way to retreat. He could only shake lightly at Lu Ke and send him towards the direction of the Green Scale Ridge.</p><p>At the same time, he hurriedly dodged and dodged the slash of the Fourth Sword that was filled with evil qi.</p><p>Black tore through the void.</p><p>The corner of the second son of the Saint Servant’s smug smile was so detestable at this moment.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ke’s eyes were filled with despair and fear.</p><p>“I failed…”</p><p>The heart of Night Guardian was about to crack as he watched Lu Ke leave him.</p><p>At this moment, he wished that the second son of the Saint Servant could die on the spot.</p><p>But he was powerless.</p><p>“Your senior has given up on you.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou leaned over and said to Lu Ke, whose body was completely stiff, “He pushed you here with his own hands. Do you feel it? Do you remember his face?”</p><p>“Hate it! Hate it! In despair…”</p><p>“I’ll kill you! ! !” Lu Ke could no longer bear the coercing by his ears. Anger surged in his heart. His body regained its strength. He lifted the famed sword and slashed it horizontally at the ugly, withered old face.</p><p>“Good sword.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou swung his sword in the air. With just a gentle push of his hand, he flipped Lu Ke, who was completely defenseless against spiritual source, causing his sword to slash down from the sky.</p><p>At the same time, a deep roar came from behind him.</p><p>“Old man, die for me!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The air was directly blown up by Xin’s kick.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou had eyes on his back, and he could even observe the entire scene.</p><p>How could he not know that Xin was also rushing towards him when the Night Guardian was moving?</p><p>He turned his body happily and aimed Lu Ke’s sword at Xin’s kick.</p><p>“Crap!”</p><p>Xin swore on the spot.</p><p>He never thought that a person could be so shameless!</p><p>There was not even a trace of the grace of a strong person on the second-in-command of the Saint Servant. It could be said that it was a negative value!</p><p>At the critical moment, Xin withdrew his leg in time. All of his strength and spiritual source were withdrawn by Xin.</p><p>Even though his qi sea was shaking violently, xin xin still could not slap his leg onto Lu Ke’s face.</p><p>It would be a small matter if his head exploded.</p><p>It was absolutely impossible for him to attack his own people.</p><p>However, Xin had the time to withdraw his hand. He also had this self-control.</p><p>Lu Ke, who was furious and slashed across with his sword, did not have any sense of propriety.</p><p>Under the crazy infusion of Sword Will, the Green Scale Ridge was even cut into black lines in the air.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>Without any suspense, the sword fell.</p><p>Half of his foot flew out and hit Lu Ke’s left face heavily, leaving a large patch of blood. Then, he was sent flying.</p><p>The air became quiet.</p><p>“AH –”</p><p>Lu Ke completely collapsed!</p><p>Dark red blood slid from the tip of his nose into his aghast mouth. Lu Ke’s pupils trembled. He could not even hold his sword steadily and fell down powerlessly.</p><p>“Xin, Wlder Xin?”</p><p>His sword was aimed at the second-in-command of the Saint Servant.</p><p>How could it be Elder Xin who was injured? !</p><p>Lu Ke held his head. His lips squirmed and closed a few times. He wanted to ask a question, but when the words reached his mouth, they only trembled twice and then disappeared.</p><p>“Xiao Ke…”</p><p>Xin’s mouth was bitter.</p><p>He did not blame Lu Ke for not being able to stop.</p><p>If he wanted to blame someone, he should blame someone. This famed sword and Green Scale Ridge was really too sharp.</p><p>In addition to being used by an inhumane old man, Lu Ke was practically a perfect weapon in the other party’s hands to deal with the Red-robed!</p><p>“Yes, that’s how it is.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled as he brought the youth who had completely lost his will closer to him. Like a devil, he said,</p><p>“Red-robed abandoned you, and your sword was aimed at them. This is the most natural and correct choice.”</p><p>“Well done!”</p><p>“Hatred, betrayal, hatred… it is indeed the best motivation for a person to grow.”</p><p>“You see, you can already hurt the Cutting Path. You are very powerful.” Xu Xiaoshou praised from the bottom of his heart.</p><p>“You shut up! ! !”</p><p>Lu Ke covered his ears and screamed hysterically. His eyes were full of regret.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled and stabbed the famed sword that fell to the ground.</p><p>“You don’t want it anymore? This is good stuff.”</p><p>Lu Ke suddenly woke up.</p><p>He curled his hand and summoned the famed sword, Green Scale Ridge, back.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded with a smile.</p><p>He had experimented before. This kind of famed sword that recognized its master could not even be kept in the Yuan mansion.</p><p>At this moment, he would not lower himself to take the sword and then be summoned back.</p><p>The Second Brother of the Saint Servant had a big face, but he could not afford to lose face.</p><p>When the famed sword, Green Scale Ridge, fell into Lu Ke’s hands, the void became a little quieter.</p><p>Night Guardian and Xin did not dare to go forward anymore.</p><p>They did not know what Lu Ke would do if the Second Brother of the Saint Servant had him.</p><p>As for Xu Xiaoshou..</p><p>“Well done.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the young man picking up the famed sword and praised, “After all, it is a famed sword. You must not let it fall into the hands of these heartless Red-robed.”</p><p>“Help me keep it for now. If anyone tries to attack you again, kill them. Don’t be polite.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The whole place was dead silent.</p><p>Lu Ke’s face was pale. The corner of his mouth twitched and he choked on his sobs.</p><p>He did not know what to do.</p><p>He wanted to throw the sword, but he was also afraid that the sword would be taken away by the saint servant.</p><p>If he did not want to throw the sword, the sword would hurt the people in the Red-robed again.</p><p>“Hiss.”</p><p>The Storyteller, who was watching from afar, could not help but shiver when he saw everything.</p><p>“Demon, Second Brother is the real demon.”</p><p>“Who can withstand this? This guy is the real pervert…”</p><p>“Cursed, passive points + 16.”</p><p>“Feared, passive points + 19.”</p><p>“Lan Ling! ! !”</p><p>The Night Guardian, who didn’t dare to go forward, couldn’t hold it in any longer and roared angrily.</p><p>“SWISH SWISH SWISH…”</p><p>With this sound, several rays of light suddenly descended from the sky and directly enveloped the Red-robed.</p><p>“Swish.”</p><p>When one of the rays of light tried to encircle Lu Ke, Xu Xiaoshou took a step forward and directly replaced the position of the young man in his hand.</p><p>Lan Ling’s face instantly twisted.</p><p>With a move of her hand, the beam of light turned in midair, shot into the ground, and disappeared.</p><p>Even if she could not bring Lu Ke back, there was nothing she could do at this time.</p><p>The space of the ancient book had to be broken.</p><p>This was the only way to save herself after so long of preparation.</p><p>Otherwise, in this space, the Saint Servant would be the butcher’s knife, and the red-robed would be the fish’s meat.</p><p>He was at the mercy of others!</p><p>Lan Ling put her hands together and shouted, “Heaven Sealing Array, sky-falling!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
