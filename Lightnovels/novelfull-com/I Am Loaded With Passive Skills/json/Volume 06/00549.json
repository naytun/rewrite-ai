He could feel that the patterns on it corresponded with the heaven-sealing array.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also believed that with the help of this array box, he could even seize control of the Thirty-Six Heavens Sealed Array from the hands of the human-controlled Red Coat.</p><p>But without Yu Zhiwen… it was so difficult!</p><p>“These damned patterns! There are so many of them.”</p><p>Just a glance at the densely packed array patterns was enough to make one go bald.</p><p>And right now, he only had the weaving expertise of a level one master.</p><p>It was too difficult to decipher.</p><p>The weaving expertise at the master stages had only a few things that were related to the Divine Secret.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was able to see the divine path pattern because he was enlightened by Yu Zhiwen’s words.</p><p>Now, he had to seize control of the great array from the other party.</p><p>It was admittedly very difficult.</p><p>“I can’t seize it. I’ll die…”</p><p>Glancing at the Red Coat and Ghost Beast who were fighting fiercely in the battlefield, Xu Xiaoshou felt a splitting headache.</p><p>He didn’t want to die.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou knew that if he remained a bystander in the battlefield, the longer the fight took, the greater the possibility that he would be involved in it.</p><p>When the time came, how would he escape?</p><p>With Elder Sang’s face?</p><p>He would only die faster!</p><p>The storyteller seemed to have been paying attention to Xu Xiaoshou’s movements.</p><p>“Second Brother, what are you trying to do…”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had no time to explain.</p><p>When he was in the City Lord Mansion of Tiansang City, he had seen part of the blueprint of the Thirty-Six Heavens Sealed Array that Night Guardian had brought over.</p><p>At that time, he could solve it easily.</p><p>Now, as long as he calmed his heart, he should be able to solve it … Right?</p><p>As his palm touched the cardinal wheel, Xu Xiaoshou began to sense it.</p><p>However..</p><p>He couldn’t figure out anything!</p><p>“No, it won’t work. This kind of difference in level and ability cannot be made up in a moment.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou understood in the blink of an eye.</p><p>A level one master was a level one master. Its ability was different from that of someone at the sovereign stage.</p><p>According to Xu Xiaoshou’s current understanding of the divine array, he couldn’t even comprehend the path patterns of the cardinal wheel, let alone control the great array.</p><p>“Oh right, last time…”</p><p>He changed his train of thought.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of the last time he saved his junior sister, when he used Xu Xiaoji to transform into a sword and enter the space inside.</p><p>“Perhaps, from there, I can sense everything and control the great array?”</p><p>He did as he thought.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou used his spiritual senses to communicate with the straw hat on his head. Then, he immediately threw it into the Yuan Mansion, disregarding the opposition of the other party.</p><p>When he took it out again, Xu Xiaoji had already turned into a black sword.</p><p>“Fourth Sword?”</p><p>A cry of surprise immediately sounded in his ears. The storyteller was obviously shocked as well.</p><p>“Second Brother, how did you…”</p><p>“That’s not right!”</p><p>The storyteller clearly saw Fourth Sword in the Holy War Black Angel’s hand. That was the real sword.</p><p>And the sword in second brother’s hand was undoubtedly a counterfeit!</p><p>But didn’t this counterfeit seem far too real?</p><p>The body of the sword, the aura, and even its feeling..</p><p>If Second Brother wasn’t holding it, the devil vein wouldn’t have appeared on his body. The storyteller even felt that the Fourth Sword had actually been split into two.</p><p>And the one in Second Brother’s hand was the other half.</p><p>To be honest, when Xu Xiaoshou saw the sword in his hand again, he was also stunned.</p><p>It was too similar!</p><p>Anyone who had seen the Fourth Sword would understand how similar the sword that Xu Xiaoji had transformed into was to the Fourth Sword.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but come up with a new idea.</p><p>“Second Brother, I’ve suddenly thought of a new tactic…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou understood instantly. The storyteller also thought of something.</p><p>But how could he agree?</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>“Just pretend that I don’t exist. My mission here is different from yours.” He immediately refuted.</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>“Hated. Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou inserted the Ji Sword into the Cardinal Wheel.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>At the same time, the Heaven Sealing Array that had sealed off the entire Lijian Grassland trembled.</p><p>The magnitude was very small.</p><p>But it was still discovered by Lan Ling.</p><p>“There’s a Grand Master!”</p><p>Lan Ling said in surprise, “Someone is spying on the great array. He wants to seize control!”</p><p>“A Spirit Array Master?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen looked back and said, “A stowaway?”</p><p>“It should be. He didn’t run away…”</p><p>Lan Ling hesitated, and then said with some doubt, “But it’s impossible for a Grand Master. I studied the ‘Thirty-Six Heavens Sealed Array’ for so long before I finally figured out the Heaven Sealing Array.”</p><p>“If the other party is a stowaway, how can he reach my level in such a short time?”</p><p>“The only explanation…”</p><p>Lan Ling’s pupils suddenly constricted. “A dao-cutting path-level divine sorcerer?”</p><p>“That’s impossible!”</p><p>Yu zhiwen immediately retorted, “Not to mention the fact that divine sorcerer is rare on the continent, there are only people in the path division who can cultivate it.”</p><p>“A Divine Sorcerer at the cutting path stage?”</p><p>“Absolutely impossible!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen shook her head and said with certainty, “These are either my master’s brothers or my senior brothers and sisters who have already left the path division.”</p><p>“It’s impossible for these people to betray the Holy Divine Palace.”</p><p>Lan Ling was silent for a moment and said after a long time, “Are you sure?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Then…”</p><p>This time, Lan Ling was speechless.</p><p>Indeed, those who could enter the six divisions of the Holy Divine Palace definitely had clean backgrounds.</p><p>Betrayal?</p><p>It was completely impossible!</p><p>Under the power of the divine force of the Hallmaster Dao, even the past, present and future lives of those people could be investigated thoroughly. How could there be betrayal?</p><p>He wasn’t a Divine Sorcerer at the level of the Cutting Path Stage, so how could he so easily trigger the Heaven Sealing Array?</p><p>“Could he be a Spirit Array Master who sneaked into the White Cave and has been studying there for a long time?”Yu Zhiwen tried to ask.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Lan Ling immediately denied that possibility. “Red Coat has already ruled it out. Even a fly can’t get into the area of the Thirty-Six Heavens Sealed Array, let alone a human…”</p><p>“Wait, there’s another possibility.”</p><p>Lan Ling suddenly thought of something and blurted out, “Cardinal Wheel!”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“There’s no need for a Divine Sorcerer at the level of the Cutting Path Stage. As long as a Spirit Array Master has the Cardinal Wheel, he can indeed control the great array through it, but…”</p><p>Lan Ling frowned as she spoke.</p><p>Red Coat had also sent people to look for the Cardinal Wheel.</p><p>However, it was only recently that they discovered that the Cardinal Wheel, which no one could ever find, had always been in the City Lord Mansion of Tiansang Prefecture.</p><p>Even Fu Zhi, who had gone missing after obtaining the Cardinal Wheel during the last opening of the White Cave, was also in the City Lord Mansion.</p><p>It was only because he was too obsessed with the Divine Secret that he had locked himself up.</p><p>“Fu Zhi didn’t enter the White Cave.”</p><p>“And if the Cardinal Wheel were to fall into the hands of someone else, he wouldn’t be able to come up with anything in a such a short period of time.”</p><p>“So, this possibility can basically be ruled out…” Lan Ling muttered to herself.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen suddenly interrupted, and a certain figure flashed through her mind.</p><p>That fellow in the Yuan Mansion. The array box filled with divine path patterns that lay quietly in a corner.</p><p>“I know who it is.”</p><p>For some reason, Yu Zhiwen didn’t say this out loud. It only echoed in her mind.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Lan Ling tilted her head and looked at Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>“No, nothing.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen hesitated for a moment. She looked at the battlefield and said, “Why don’t you continue to control the great array to help Red Coat. Leave the one who usurped the control of the great array to me?”</p><p>Lan Ling’s eyes were filled with suspicion.</p><p>Clearly, the woman in front of her had discovered something.</p><p>But if she didn’t want to say it, Lan Ling wouldn’t be able to force her.</p><p>After all, Yu Zhiwen was hallmaster Dao’s niece.</p><p>In terms of status, she was several levels higher than Lan Ling.</p><p>Strictly speaking, this was a superior sent by the higher-ups..</p><p>“Alright, I’ll leave it to you.”</p><p>Lan Ling didn’t say anything else.</p><p>No matter what Yu Zhiwen was thinking, her background and status determined that she would never betray the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>Some things were destined from birth.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s hands were empty, and her spiritual senses were connected to the great array just like Lan Ling’s.</p><p>After hesitating for a while, she was worried and sent a part of her spiritual senses to the Thirty-Six Heavens Sealed Array.</p><p>Although unlikely, but if it was him..</p><p>“I’d better be more careful!”</p><p>..</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>“It’s connected.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was ecstatic.</p><p>When the Ji Sword was inserted into the indentation of the Cardinal Wheel, he immediately sensed the internal space of the Cardinal Wheel.</p><p>At the same time, a faint connection seemed to be established between the Cardinal Wheel and the Thirty-Six Heavens Sealed Array.</p><p>“Can it be controlled?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was instantly shocked.</p><p>As he stroked the Cardinal Wheel, the structure of the Thirty-Six Heavens Sealed Array appeared in his mind.</p><p>He could clearly sense if the level of the spiritual array was reached.</p><p>With this thought, this great array could be adopted for his own use.</p><p>“There’s no need to solve it…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>He completely understood.</p><p>This so-called Thirty-Six Heavens Sealed Array was similar to the other Heaven and Earth Great Array in the White Cave. It was created to protect the Cardinal Wheel and the Fourth Sword.</p><p>However, because the Fourth Sword was too powerful, the level of this great array that was created from heaven and earth was also increased tremendously.</p><p>But in essence, these things were all the same.</p><p>It was like taking the Three Days Frozen Calamity and being able to control the Frost World, making it shatter.</p><p>After obtaining the Cardinal Wheel, the Thirty-Six Heavens Sealed Array could also be used in this way.</p><p>However, because the level of the great array was too high, it had already formed its own body.</p><p>If one wanted to use it fully, they also needed to have a certain standard of the spiritual array level.</p><p>With Xu Xiaoshou’s current level, it was indeed impossible to use it completely.</p><p>However, it was possible for him to partially utilize it.</p><p>“Genius, I’m really a genius!”</p><p>At this moment, it was as it the words Fu Zhi had spoken at the Sea of Flowers in the City Lord Mansion had returned Xu Xiaoshou’s mind.</p><p>That fellow was obsessed with spiritual array. He had worked for many years, but had yet to crack the Cardinal Wheel.</p><p>However, a tool was a tool.</p><p>Most of the time, the user didn’t need to fully understand its internal structure and the process of its creation.</p><p>Knowing how to use it was enough!</p><p>Just like how Fu Zhi could use the Cardinal Wheel as a tool to store his junior sister into its internal space, Xu Xiaoshou could also use the Cardinal Wheel to control some of the functions of the Thirty-Six Heavens Sealed Array.</p><p>Yes, it was not just the great array.</p><p>It was the Thirty-Six Heavens Sealed Array!</p><p>The great array was only a derivative of the latter. In front of the Cardinal Wheel, it was nothing.</p><p>“It’s too awesome!”</p><p>When he realised that he could now manipulate and fight unpredictably, Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>The feeling of being able to secretly use an omnipotent perspective to peep at the big shots while they while they were fighting to the death and simultaneously borrow part of the God’s power was really too great.</p><p>“No, I can’t do it recklessly.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wanted to use the power of the great array to trap someone and test it out, but he quickly suppressed his impulse.</p><p>“Now that I have control of the great array, it should attract Yu Zhiwen and Lan Ling’s attention.”</p><p>“With the Storyteller’s Divine Secrets Shield, they won’t be able to find me.”</p><p>“But with the power of the great array, it’s different. When the time comes, it’ll be easy to find out.”</p><p>“The most important thing now…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned to look at the great array in front of him.</p><p>He wanted to take control of the great array to escape, not to attack.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never forgotten his initial intention.</p><p>“I’ll use the great array to open the barrier door secretly. As long as I run out, everything will be successful.”</p><p>“As for Fourth Sword, whoever wants it can have it. I, Xu Xiaoshou… can’t afford to provoke them!”</p><p>The sensing of the Heaven Sealing Array was very simple.</p><p>Holding the Cardinal Wheel, Xu Xiaoshou could sense the great array in a short while.</p><p>With a slight movement of his spiritual senses, the barrier in front of him was thinned layer by layer.</p><p>..</p><p>“There’s movement.”</p><p>Lan Ling sensed it immediately.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen nodded her head and locked right onto the pursuit.</p><p>However, halfway through the power of the great array, it was directly intercepted and killed.</p><p>The entire Lijian Grassland, the large swath of land near the great array and the Way of the Heavens were directly cut off, and there was no trace of it at all.</p><p>“Someone is interfering…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s face turned pale.</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>Lan Ling asked while assisting Red Coat in the battle.</p><p>“Cutting Path!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen said in panic, “The Peak of Cutting Path. It might even be the Higher Void…”</p><p>Lan Ling’s body suddenly trembled.</p><p>In other words, in the Lijian Grassland, there was not only a Spirit Array Master who seemed to have the Cardinal Wheel, but also someone at the Peak of Cutting Path?</p><p>“Saint Servant, Storyteller!”</p><p>Lan Ling immediately came to a realization.</p><p>The top combat strength in the White Cave could only be matched by the Saint Servant, who had yet to make a move.</p><p>However, Ghost Beast was fighting Red Coat.</p><p>The Saint Servant had to fight the White-clothed!</p><p>Those existences were far beyond what the current Red Coat could withstand.</p><p>“Contact the outside world. If necessary, Elder Wuyue might have to act.” Lan Ling transmitted her voice to Red Coat behind her.</p><p>Red Coat nodded slightly and retreated immediately.</p><p>However, not long after, he returned to Lan Ling’s side in shock.</p><p>“I can’t, I can’t contact…”</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>..</p><p>“It’s about to open, it’s about to open.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the thin layers of small barrier doors and became excited.</p><p>At this time, the defensive strength of the small barrier doors in front of Xu Xiaoshou could no longer withstand the power of his Perception.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately focused all his mental energy on Perception and tried his best to extend it.</p><p>He wanted to find a way to escape in advance!</p><p>However..</p><p>Chi, chi, chi.</p><p>The image that came from Perception was a piece of darkness and nothingness. There were also extremely high frequency spatial blade fragments that were constantly moving through the outside world.</p><p>“Spatial fragment?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was completely stunned. “This…”</p><p>Had area outside the Lijian Gassland exploded?</p><p>It had all turned into spatial fragment?</p><p>Xu Xiashou continued to extend the range of his Perception in disbelief, but the more he looked, the more panicked he became.</p><p>It was gone.</p><p>Everything was really gone.</p><p>The entire White Cave, apart from the Lijian Grassland, had all turned into spatial fragments!</p><p>“This, does this mean that if we leave, we will die?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart stopped. His face turned pale, and his thoughts went blank.</p><p>What happened outside?</p><p>Was the White Cave gone?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
