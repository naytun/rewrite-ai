Why would they take a fancy to them?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s face darkened.</p><p>You are the Chief of the Saint Servant. How can you belittle yourself like this?</p><p>“Ha,” The masked man seemed to know what he was thinking and was immediately amused.</p><p>“But besides these three in the White Cave, who else could catch the eye of the Holy Emperor?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu didn’t care and continued to ask, “The rest are all insignificant young people… could it be that they are stowaway?”</p><p>“They look down on people who are sneaky,” the masked man said.</p><p>“Then… an Experiencer?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu was shocked. “So it’s really a young person?”</p><p>He couldn’t imagine that the Holy Emperor’s plan would actually focus on a young person in the end.</p><p>“But doesn’t the young person still need to grow up?”</p><p>“Let’s not talk about whether or not they will die halfway. Can they wait for the young man to grow up?” Cen Qiaofu didn’t believe it.</p><p>Hearing this, the masked man laughed.</p><p>“They have already waited for so long, why would they still be in such a hurry?”</p><p>“Who is it!” Cen Qiaofu was anxious.</p><p>He could not think of any young person in the White Cave who would be able to catch the Holy Emperor’s attention.</p><p>Luo Leilei?</p><p>Lei Shuangxing?</p><p>No.</p><p>One was not qualified, the other had his mission, how could he be free?</p><p>So, was it someone from the Holy Divine Palace then?</p><p>“No.”</p><p>The masked man rolled his eyes and knew that Cen Qiaofu’s thoughts had gone astray.</p><p>“You know that person as well, and you’ve even ‘met’ him before.”</p><p>“Met?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu was stunned by the Chief’s purposefully emphasized tone. All of a sudden, a hedgehog flashed through his mind.</p><p>“It’s him?”</p><p>“Yes, the person I like…”</p><p>The masked man did not respond facing him. Instead, he shifted his gaze to the direction of White Cave.</p><p>“But theoretically speaking, after this trip to White Cave, I might not be the only one who sees him.”</p><p>“Wen Ming!” Cen Qiaofu blurted out.</p><p>At this moment, the blurry figure in his mind directly materialized into a young man.</p><p>However, during the collision at Tiansang Spirit Palace, both parties had only met each other. He did not see how powerful this young man was.</p><p>But why did the Chief always praise him so much?</p><p>Even before entering the White Cave, he specially recommended this person to the Storyteller.</p><p>“Is he that strong?” Cen Qiaofu asked curiously.</p><p>“Let’s see!”</p><p>The masked man smiled and didn’t comment.</p><p>See if the person he liked didn’t die halfway.</p><p>Then, at least in the White Cave, there would probably be a few who targeted him.</p><p>The Holy Divine Palace, the Ghost Beast, and the Holy Emperor’s plan…</p><p>“Tsk tsk.”</p><p>A strange emotion suddenly flashed through the masked man’s turbid eyes.</p><p>That feeling was like a child’s favorite toy was seen by others because it was too dazzling.</p><p>The kind of happiness one had from possessing it alone and was suddenly forced to choose. There was an additional feeling that it had to be shared with others…</p><p>It was indeed very distressing!</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>The masked man did not say much but walked outside.</p><p>“Where are we going this time?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu immediately followed.</p><p>“To see if the Storyteller can successfully bring Wen Ming here, or…”</p><p>The masked man suddenly stopped, as if he had also noticed the movement from the outside world. He suddenly laughed, “I’m just joining in on the fun.”</p><p>..</p><p>White Cave.</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou landed on the ground with a bang. The golden light shattered and turned into a human form.</p><p>Feeling the empty energy reserve, he finally had the time to look back. Then, he clenched his fist and waved it fiercely.</p><p>“Oh my, I escaped!”</p><p>When the Storyteller and the Night Guardian attacked at the same time, he was still able to take that step forward.</p><p>It had to be said that this was something that could only be achieved with the courage that he had accumulated all his life.</p><p>He was very glad that he had succeeded.</p><p>The energy that exploded from the compressed form of Song of Ice and Fire was not something that an ordinary person could withstand.</p><p>That was a power that was enough to destroy the entire Spirit Fusion Swamp!</p><p>The collision force between the Infernal Original Seed and the Three Days Frozen Calamity would not be reduced just because they had been subdued.</p><p>On the contrary, under Xu Xiaoshou’s deliberate manipulation, more energy was pressed into the balance point between the two.</p><p>The power of the explosion would only be more terrifying.</p><p>However…</p><p>“Hiss.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s body spasmed as he took big mouthfuls of elixirs.</p><p>He looked at his cracked body in pain yet felt refreshed and comfortable. His left hand, which had been completely corroded by the destructive aura, was recovering bit by bit.</p><p>“This is too terrifying.”</p><p>“If I use this move, I’ll be able to kill a thousand enemies. Seven hundred and fifty would be lost, and I’ll only be left with two hundred and fifty.”</p><p>“With my Master Physique, I won’t be able to hold on…”</p><p>Feeling that even with Eternal Vitality, the injury on his arm was still recovering at the speed of a tortoise, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to relax.</p><p>This was the consequence of relaxing once.</p><p>Who would dare to relax?</p><p>And to wait for this arm to finish restoring itself, would probably take more than half a day.</p><p>The only thing worth rejoicing over was that this was still a problem that could be solved with time.</p><p>“Then, where do I escape to next?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held the Fourth Sword in his hand and looked around, somewhat confused.</p><p>In theory, if an ordinary White Cave experiencer wanted to give up on his experiential training, he only needed to crush the exquisite stone to get the care of the Red Coat and then leave the realm.</p><p>However…</p><p>“This is too unscientific.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not even dare to put the exquisite stone in his ring now because he was afraid that he would get special treatment from the Red Coat.</p><p>If he wanted to break the realm, he could only rely on himself!</p><p>“Buzz, buzz, buzz –”</p><p>The surrounding space fluctuated, and the power grew stronger.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that this was the effect of the explosion of Ice and Fire seed that he had left behind.</p><p>He estimated that once the time was up, even if the energy of the explosion was stopped at the last moment, the White Cave would be broken!</p><p>But… it needed time!</p><p>“Then, where can we go during this period?”</p><p>“Find a place to hide, wait for the White Cave to shatter, and reap benefits from the confusion?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had such a thought.</p><p>He even wanted to take out the Abrogated Origin Residence and directly seek shelter from it.</p><p>But…</p><p>“Being watched, passive points +1.”</p><p>He looked at the information bar that refreshed every once in a while, and he was unable to calm down.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little flustered.</p><p>It was impossible for the Night Guardian to catch up.</p><p>At the final moment, his “Perception” saw that the red-robed man had sacrificed his life for justice and chose to swallow the Ice and Fire seed in one gulp. Tears almost burst out of his eyes as a tribute to the Night Guardian.</p><p>After the other party forcefully received that attack, it was impossible for him to have the strength to track him down.</p><p>Then…</p><p>Storyteller?</p><p>“No, no.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s “Perception” could not even catch a trace of the Storyteller’s aura.</p><p>Previously, the Night Guardian was able to catch up to him purely because of Lu Ke’s famed sword, Green Scale Ridge.</p><p>Now, putting aside the fact that he used “Ascending to the Heavens in A Single Step” when he disappeared…</p><p>Even if he did not use it, he would stay where he was.</p><p>It was likely that the Storyteller would choose to leave so that he could stay alive and would not pay attention to the center of the explosion.</p><p>Therefore, there was no reason for him to catch up to him.</p><p>“Then who could it be?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou faintly felt that he had overlooked something.</p><p>After thinking hard, he finally remembered that when he fought with the Storyteller, almost every time he checked the information bar, he would accidentally catch a glimpse of the existence of this “Being watched” message.</p><p>At that time, he thought that it was because the Storyteller was constantly paying attention to him.</p><p>But now?</p><p>The other party had disappeared.</p><p>Then this “Being watched” message, just who was looking at him?</p><p>“I’m so flustered…”</p><p>“I should be feeling very perturbed, but why is it that I’m only a little anxious and not overly worried?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that something was wrong with his current state.</p><p>In the past, when he saw the message “Being watched,” he was always scared until his scalp went numb.</p><p>But this time…</p><p>“Being watched, passive points +1.”</p><p>It appeared again!</p><p>But, why did it feel like it didn’t matter after a brief feeling of “oh it appeared again”?</p><p>“Something’s wrong with me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s energy reserve recovered a little of his spiritual source. Xu Xiaoshou clearly felt that he should panic, but he was too calm, so calm to the point that it was somewhat abnormal.</p><p>“Disappear.”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, he disappeared on the spot. Only then did he feel a bit better.</p><p>“Who is looking at me?”</p><p>Looking around…</p><p>Everything was silent, and there was no one.</p><p>Other than Aje’s stone, there was no other creature watching him.</p><p>“Calm down…”</p><p>“No, be more anxious.”</p><p>“Who is it, who is looking at me?!”</p><p>“Being watched, passive points +1.”</p><p>The information bar jumped again, and Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils constricted.</p><p>He realized that something was wrong!</p><p>The ‘Vanishing Technique’ was supposed to make him disappear completely, so how could it seem that others could still see him even though he had disappeared?</p><p>Thinking carefully…</p><p>When he had fought the Storyteller previously, even when he had disappeared, there seemed to be a situation where this ‘Being watched’ message had appeared before.</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had disappeared, could finally feel some panic.</p><p>This was because some external forces that were silently affecting him seemed to have been blocked by the ‘Vanishing Technique’.</p><p>However, a person couldn’t be blocked?</p><p>How was it that the unknown fellow was still able to see him?</p><p>“Calm down and think. Use your brain, Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Forcing the noisy thoughts to stop, Xu Xiaoshou opened his arms, as if wanting to embrace this world that was about to disappear.</p><p>As his mind quieted down, he seemed to hear more voices.</p><p>“Rustle, rustle, rustle…”</p><p>The sound of the wind!</p><p>“Crack, crack –”</p><p>The sound of space shattering!</p><p>It came from far away. It seemed that the White Cave was really about to shatter…</p><p>So, what other sounds had he been ignoring all this time?</p><p>He tried his best to let go of himself.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou subconsciously raised his head. He felt that his soul had left his body and completely fused into this world.</p><p>“Buzz.”</p><p>Fourth Sword was vibrating?</p><p>The vibration was very light. Why?</p><p>No, it wasn’t because of this…</p><p>The Fourth Sword shouldn’t be enough to trigger the message “Being watched”.</p><p>What else?</p><p>What else had he forgotten all along?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s energy reserve gradually bottomed out. He felt that he couldn’t hold on any longer and was about to disappear.</p><p>All of a sudden, his soul that had merged into the Way of the Heavens, seemed to have risen to the highest point and touched something icy cold.</p><p>What was this?</p><p>“Pitter-patter…”</p><p>Rain!</p><p>The rain continued to fall.</p><p>Above the Nine Heavens, the curtain of rain that could only pull apart a height of fewer than three meters had covered the entire White Cave. It was not easy for it to barge into Xu Xiaoshou’s “Perception”.</p><p>“Is this it?”</p><p>With a whoosh, his energy reserve once again bottomed out.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt as if something flashed past his mind, but he could no longer recall it.</p><p>“Rain?”</p><p>“It’s raining in the White Cave?”</p><p>He seemed to have just realized it.</p><p>However, in the depths of his memory, there was a vague and seemingly never-before-seen image of the rain as soon as he came out of the ancient book’s space.</p><p>“I…forgot?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the curtain of rain above the Nine Heavens in a daze.</p><p>After a long while, he lowered his head and began to think again.</p><p>“Being watched…”</p><p>“Who sent this?”</p><p>The information bar suddenly moved and another message popped up.</p><p>“Being hypnotized, passive points +1.”</p><p>Buzz–</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s hair stood on end!</p><p>“F*ck!!!”</p><p>“Hypnotized?”</p><p>“Rain?”</p><p>He looked up in horror again and saw the curtain of rain in the sky. It was as if a bolt of lightning had struck his mind!</p><p>“It’s looking at me!”</p><p>His breathing suddenly became intense.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils constricted and his eyes widened as if they were about to split open.</p><p>“Moreover, not only is it looking at me, but it’s also hypnotizing me?”</p><p>“It…”</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt something flash past his mind, but he could not catch it at all.</p><p>“What am I doing?”</p><p>Twisting his neck, which seemed to be in pain because he had raised it forcefully, Xu Xiaoshou frowned and slowly lowered his head.</p><p>His pupils slowly dilated.</p><p>Following that, his brows also relaxed.</p><p>Even the anxiety on his face seemed to have been smoothed out by an unknown hand.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but mutter.</p><p>“Why do I feel a little flustered…”</p><p>“Who on earth is watching me?”</p><p>He subconsciously glanced at the information bar.</p><p>However, the information bar didn’t move at all. Xu Xiaoshou also felt that he was a little baffled.</p><p>Why did he subconsciously look at the information bar even though he had already escaped danger…</p><p>“Crazy!”</p><p>He pursed his lips and shook his head.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou threw away the messy thoughts that seemed to be running wild just now, but he couldn’t remember anything at all. He returned to his original train of thoughts.</p><p>“Damn it, how do I break this White Cave?”</p><p>With his face twisted, Xu Xiaoshou was extremely distressed. “It’s clearly something that can be done with just the exquisite stone…”</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>Fourth Sword suddenly vibrated even more violently. It seemed to have sensed something.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face lit up.</p><p>He knew that because of the sword cognition, the vicious sword had initially recognized him.</p><p>Could it be that it had sensed his intentions?</p><p>“Do you have a way to break the realm?”</p><p>“Clang –”</p><p>Fourth Sword shook violently as if it was about to leave his hand.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly followed its footsteps.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll count on you!”</p><p>He loosened his grip a little.</p><p>As expected, the already obedient Fourth Sword soared into the air on its own with him behind as it headed straight for a certain point.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were filled with joy.</p><p>As expected, at the critical moment, he still needed the guidance of the Master of the White Cave, the vicious sword!</p><p>His entire mind was focused on seeing if there was any danger ahead. He completely forgot that no matter how dangerous the situation was, he would spare even the slightest bit of spiritual senses and place it on the information bar.</p><p>Silently, the information bar jumped again.</p><p>“Being watched, passive points +1.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
