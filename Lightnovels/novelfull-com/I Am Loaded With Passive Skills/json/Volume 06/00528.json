If he knew how to speak, he should have said it earlier and said more!</p><p>“Hated On, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Watched, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s Perception was activated, but he couldn’t find anyone.</p><p>He couldn’t help but panic.</p><p>What other special movement technique couldn’t even be detected by his Perception?</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>The voice sounded vaguely familiar, but Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t figure out who it was at all, so he shouted and asked.</p><p>“Keke.”</p><p>With a laugh, a crack opened in the air, and a woman in a simple gray robe appeared.</p><p>Mu Zixi’s eyes immediately popped out.</p><p>Although this woman was dressed in a loose gray robe, due to her hot figure, the parts of her body that were supposed to be tight were so tight that they almost split open… it was as if they were about to pop out!</p><p>In addition, there was a large purple chain that was intertwined and bound from all parts of her body, deeply embedded in the crevice of the robe.</p><p>Her chest was even more eye-catching.</p><p>It was hard to imagine!</p><p>Mu Zixi simply couldn’t imagine what she had eaten while growing up to obtain such a figure.</p><p>The flames of envy burned fiercely.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, who is this woman?” She couldn’t help but turn around and ask.</p><p>“Questioned. Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Jiao Tangtang?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at this face that he had met once before and couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise, “You’re looking for me?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang took a step forward and her gaze landed on Mu Zixi.</p><p>However, with just a glance, she ignored it.</p><p>“I’m specifically looking for you.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s brows raised and his heart relaxed.</p><p>He looked behind the woman and asked, “Why are you looking for me? Where’s Xin Gugu?”</p><p>“He didn’t come.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang said, “At the Fourth Sword’s area, the method of gathering a large number of Spirit Array Casters by the Red Coats was very effective. More than half of the Thirty-Six Heavens Sealed Array has already been broken. I’m afraid that in a few days, the things inside will truly be unsealed.”</p><p>“After Xin Gugu met with me, he has already gone to complete his mission.”</p><p>“The Fourth Sword?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang nodded without any hesitation. “His mission is the ‘Fourth Sword’. Whether he can get it or not is another matter. At the very least, he has to create chaos in the White Cave. Only then will we have a chance to escape.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was keenly aware of the error in Jiao Tangtang’s words.</p><p>“Only then will we have a chance to… escape?”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang smiled and said, “Let’s not talk about other things first. Let me tell you about the current situation outside the White Cave.”</p><p>“The Seven Sword Deity, Gou Wuyue has brought a group of White-clothed and has completely sealed off all the spatial passageways to escape from the White Cave Small World.”</p><p>“Even though they seemed to have been stopped midway, the remnants of the White-clothed people are enough to deal with all the stowaways in the Small World of White Cave who had already become ghost beasts.”</p><p>“The situation is not optimistic. I need your help.”</p><p>Hearing this, Xu Xiaoshou’s face stiffened.</p><p>“What did you say… White-clothed? Gou Wuyue?”</p><p>“Yeah, why?”</p><p>“The Seven Sword Deity, Gou Wuyue?” Xu Xiaoshou’s lips turned white.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang nodded and said, “He is one of the two rulers of the Holy Divine Palace, the Sword Deity with the title of one of the Ten High Nobles, Gou Wuyue. Is there a problem?”</p><p>“No problem…”</p><p>“No problem my foot!” Xu Xiaoshou cursed in his heart.</p><p>He felt his heart turn cold at this moment!</p><p>What the hell is this!</p><p>He had just finished beating up his disciple not long ago, and his master came so soon?</p><p>After beating up the little one, the old one came out… this wasn’t the way to play!</p><p>Shouldn’t he give others some room to grow?</p><p>Even novels weren’t written like this!</p><p>Was he trying to torture people to death?</p><p>Moreover, how did this Sword Deity, Gou Wuyue learn from the outside world that his disciple was beaten up in the White Cave, and in the blink of an eye, he came from…</p><p>“He came from the headquarters of the Holy Divine Palace, the Central Region?” Xu Xiaoshou asked in surprise.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>A positive answer.</p><p>“Darn it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou swore that he would not dare to touch anyone with a background in the future.</p><p>There was no need for this protector to be so exaggerated, right?</p><p>He directly teleported across two regions just to… mess with me?</p><p>Jiao Tangtang looked at Xu Xiaoshou’s pale face and realized that this guy seemed to have misunderstood something.</p><p>“Gou Wuyue rushed here from the Central Region to capture the Seventh Chief of the Saint Servant, an existence called… the Storyteller.”</p><p>“Did you offend Moonless Sword Deity?” Jiao Tangtang raised her eyebrows. She felt that it was completely impossible.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not reply directly. Hearing this, he felt relieved.</p><p>Saint Servant?</p><p>That Moonless Sword Deity probably did not come to look for him on purpose.</p><p>But suddenly, his little heart started to throb as if it had suffered a heart attack.</p><p>That’s not right!</p><p>“Saint Servant?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly turned his head to look at his Junior Sister.</p><p>Mu Zixi’s large eyes blinked innocently, and two large wooden mallets appeared in her hands once again.</p><p>This time, they were solid.</p><p>“Storyteller, what does he look like?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou asked as he described with his hands and said, “Is that person around this height and has two twin ponytails…”</p><p>“Pa! Pa!”</p><p>“Beaten, Passive Points, +2.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang looked at the pair of Senior Brother and Junior Sister with a strange expression.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart relaxed.</p><p>Then, he heard the opposite party continue, “But his appearance is indeed very iconic. If you’ve seen him before, you definitely won’t forget him.”</p><p>“The Storyteller usually wears a red dress, but that person seems to be a man. He’s not old and looks to be in his early 20s, but his bone age must be more than that.”</p><p>“He seems to be a little sissy…”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang frowned. “I don’t know much about the Saint Servant either. These are all information from the spies outside…”</p><p>“En, Xu Xiaoshou, what’s wrong?”</p><p>Halfway through her sentence, Jiao Tangtang looked at Xu Xiaoshou who had suddenly collapsed to the ground with a baffled expression.</p><p>This fellow seemed to be undergoing some kind of terrifying baptism. His face was as pale as paper, and not even a trace of his ruddy color could be seen.</p><p>Looking at him in this manner, he was simply a corpse that could still breathe!</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his legs go soft.</p><p>The man in the red dress?</p><p>Wasn’t he the fellow that he had seen during the great explosion of the Spirit Fusion Swamp?</p><p>As expected, there wouldn’t be a normal person that I, Xu Xiaoshou, had met by my side, right?!</p><p>This kind of existence that could make the grey mist figure so afraid that it had to work together with me to break through the ancient book space was a legendary big shot!</p><p>Saint Servant…</p><p>Seventh Chief…</p><p>That was the Masked Man’s subordinate?</p><p>“Oh my God!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind went blank.</p><p>At this moment, he was purely having a lingering fear.</p><p>His clothes were instantly drenched in a cold sweat.</p><p>Other than fear, he didn’t have any other emotions.</p><p>Fortunately, he had fallen out with the Night Guardian and didn’t stay in that place for too long.</p><p>If he was the Saint Servant’s Seventh Chief, then the Night Guardian and the grey mist figure might truly be in danger!</p><p>“I was just very lucky, right?”</p><p>“Fortunately, I left first. Luckily…”</p><p>After regaining his composure, Xu Xiaoshou wanted to stand up, but he realized that his legs were a little weak.</p><p>He pretended to be indifferent and patted the ground.</p><p>“Sit down. What are you in a daze for?”</p><p>“If you have something to say, it’s good to sit and chat. Isn’t your waist hurting from all that talking while standing?”</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, why is your voice trembling?” Mu Zixi wasn’t as polite as Jiao Tangtang and directly said it. As she said it, she squatted down curiously.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glared at his Junior Sister.</p><p>You won’t die if you shut up!</p><p>Can’t you just obediently be mute?</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang sat down indifferently and was quite close to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>“Where were you just now? The amount of information is a bit too much. Let me slow down.” Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his head.</p><p>“Cooperation.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang smiled and said, “Based on this, I need your help to escape from White-clothed’s encirclement.”</p><p>“How can I help?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned pale with fright. “Are you crazy? That’s the Seven Sword Deity! His name is Gou Wuyue! I’m just a small fry. How can I help? Becoming a cannon fodder and escort you away?”</p><p>He slowly moved away from Jiao Tangtang’s side. All of a sudden, he felt a lot of strength gushing out of his body. He jumped up and grabbed his Junior Sister’s hand. He had a guarded expression that said that if something went wrong, he would use Ascending to the Heavens in A Single Step and flee far away,</p><p>Mu Zixi’s face turned red. Her hand symbolically struggled two times.</p><p>“Resisted, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang laughed.</p><p>“Little underling… you’re quite self-aware.”</p><p>She teased and her expression became serious as she said slowly, “In your current state, you can’t be of much help in the overall situation.”</p><p>“However, there’s a method that can let us get out of this mess!”</p><p>“What method?” Xu Xiaoshou was startled.</p><p>“What do you think?”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang patted her butt and stood up. The big purple chains that were tied around her body were clanging loudly, causing Mu Zixi’s eyes to become absent-minded.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned.</p><p>Jiao Tangtang was able to find him, and she was even able to resist Gou Wuyue’s power out of thin air?</p><p>What kind of joke was this?</p><p>There was such a thing on my body?</p><p>Suddenly, his pupils constricted. Xu Xiaoshou thought of something and said in disbelief, “That, that broken cat?”</p><p>“What broken cat!”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang’s expression turned sullen and she said furiously, “That’s Greedy the Cat Spirit!”</p><p>“Alright, alright, Greedy the Cat Spirit, Greedy the Cat Spirit…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou repeated two sentences in a daze and asked in surprise, “What do you mean?”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang didn’t say much nonsense. Under Mu Zixi’s widened eyes, she stuck her hand into her chest and took out an old beast skin scroll that was still warm.</p><p>“Contract!” She said firmly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou subconsciously took a step back.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“It’s already called a ‘contract’. What else do you think it meant?”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang sneered and paced around. “Greedy the Cat Spirit has been with you for a while. I believe that he has already developed feelings for you. Now is the best time to sign the Ghost Beast Contract.”</p><p>Ghost Beast Contract?</p><p>Upon hearing this term, Mu Zixi finally pulled her soul out of her fleshy brain.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, this…”</p><p>She had just listened to Xu Xiaoshou explain how terrifying the ghost beast host body was.</p><p>Now, this woman came over and wanted her Senior Brother to sign a contract with the ghost beast?</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>The two sentences in unison overlapped.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou and Jiao Tangtang looked back at the little girl at the same time.</p><p>Mu Zixi’s face stiffened. She gripped her Senior Brother tightly as if she was afraid of losing her beloved lollipop. She said loudly, “Xu Xiaoshou can’t sign a ‘Ghost Beast Contract’ with you!”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang opened her red lips in surprise and wanted to say something.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already calmed down.</p><p>“My Junior Sister is right. I can’t sign this contract.”</p><p>“You won’t sign It?”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang’s eyes narrowed. “Xu Xiaoshou, what’s the situation now? Do you still think you can do whatever you want?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t reply. He just shook his head indifferently.</p><p>How could he sign the Ghost Beast Contract?</p><p>He had just promised the Red Coat Night Guardian that he would never be the host body of a ghost beast. He would only use Greedy the Cat Spirit to see the truth of the Ghost Beast World.</p><p>The situation with Lu Ke, who was both a Red Coat and a ghost beast had just been discovered. This was a good opportunity to see the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>Under such circumstances, how could Xu Xiaoshou let himself fall into this swamp that he did not know whether it was a blessing or a curse?</p><p>A blessing? It was impossible.</p><p>At best, it was just a pool of muddy water with big and small disasters.</p><p>“Greedy the Cat Spirit, I’ll return it to you. The contract is impossible.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered for a moment and felt that the situation had exceeded his ability. He didn’t want to get involved in this muddy water.</p><p>Hence, he caught the little white cat that had gained weight from the Yuan Mansion and passed it to her.</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>The little white cat was still in its cute and ignorant state.</p><p>When it saw that Xu Xiaoshou was finally willing to get close to it, it licked Xu Xiaoshou’s wrist vigorously the moment it appeared.</p><p>“Slurp”</p><p>“Slurp”</p><p>“This… is a ghost beast?”</p><p>Mu Zixi was stunned.</p><p>In the past, she could not see the existence of the little white cat.</p><p>However, ever since she had awakened the God Devil Eyes, she was able to discover that there was such a cute little cat in the Yuan Mansion space.</p><p>But, this was a ghost beast?</p><p>Shouldn’t a ghost beast be one of those dark giant beasts with big bloody mouths, sharp fangs and angry horns, and a mouth filled with stinky saliva?</p><p>At the very least, shouldn’t they be the mysterious and unfathomable existence of the grey mist figure who could seal everything and make people lose consciousness with a single palm?</p><p>A little kitten?</p><p>What bad thoughts could a little kitten have?</p><p>How could it be a ghost beast!</p><p>Mu Zixi felt that her worldview had suffered a blow.</p><p>So, it might have been something like this cute little thing that scared the fearless Xu Xiaoshou so much that he escaped from the Path Pattern Initial Stone to this place?</p><p>This was too timid, Xu Xiaoshou is too timid!</p><p>So you are such a timid person?</p><p>“Belittled, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang looked at the kitten in the young man’s hand and laughed out loud.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you are too naive!”</p><p>“Do you really think that an existence like the ghost beast is something that you can mess with if you want to? If you don’t want it, you can just give it away?”</p><p>“Yes.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded expressionlessly.</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang choked and angrily flung the animal skin roll in her hand. She shouted, “You have to sign this contract today. Even if you sign it, or you don’t want to, you still have to sign it!”</p><p>“What do you mean ‘even if you sign it’?” Xu Xiaoshou looked confused. “Isn’t signing it just signing it? There’s no such thing as ‘even if you sign it’. With your level of education…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang angrily interrupted Xu Xiaoshou. “I dare you to try making jokes again?”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pulled Mu Zixi back and said in disbelief, “If I try it, I will die?”</p><p>“Take a guess!”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang’s eyes became dangerous, and a strange black mist appeared in her pupils.</p><p>“Enter Yuan Mansion.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around and ordered.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Mu Zixi didn’t say anything else.</p><p>At the critical moment, she definitely wouldn’t become the chain that would fall off Xu Xiaoshou’s body.</p><p>The sound of her voice fell.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wanted to use his spiritual senses to open the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>However, the Yuan Mansion’s spatial passageway seemed to have completely lost its effect and couldn’t be opened!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, there’s no need to try. This space has long been sealed by me. Any possibility of escape that you have imagined will not appear.” Jiao Tangtang sneered.</p><p>“Darn it, Xin Gugu…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart sank to the bottom.</p><p>Xin Gugu must have revealed the existence of his Yuan Mansion to Jiao Tangtang in advance.</p><p>It was even possible that he had revealed all of his special abilities. That was why Jiao Tangtang could treat him so seriously.</p><p>Otherwise, it was just a one-time encounter.</p><p>When a Sovereign faced an ant, like the Innate, they wouldn’t prepare so much in advance!</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>While he was in a daze, a soft shout sounded from behind him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked back, only to see the yin-yang fish in Mu Zixi’s eyes retreat.</p><p>This time, he felt the space loosen up.</p><p>With another spiritual sense, the Yuan Mansion spatial passageway appeared.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I’ll go in first. You guys can chat slowly.”</p><p>Mu Zixi stepped into the spatial passageway and didn’t forget to turn around and glare at him. She threatened, “Don’t act recklessly!”</p><p>With that, a light flashed and she disappeared.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang was shocked.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>She couldn’t see Xu Xiaoshou’s cultivation level clearly, but with Xin Gugu’s instructions, she was already on high alert.</p><p>But this Junior Sister of his…</p><p>What was going on!</p><p>A cultivation level of the Upper Spiritual Level could break the space blockade of a Sovereign with just a glance?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, she…”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang could not help but feel curious. Just as she wanted to ask something, Xu Xiaoshou stopped her.</p><p>“Wait, I’m a little flustered. I’ll call someone first.”</p><p>He waved his hand.</p><p>Then, a light flashed in the air and the world suddenly turned completely dark.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Two towering giants that were nearly a hundred meters tall landed.</p><p>One was white and the other was blue.</p><p>One on the left and one on the right.</p><p>Like a close-fitting yin-yang protector, they directly smashed onto the back of Xu Xiaoshou and stood apart.</p><p>The Ice Blue White Skeleton, Ice, was still fine.</p><p>It had a quiet personality. The moment it was summoned, it would sit down quietly.</p><p>Then, it quietly felt the frozen power in its master’s body and slowly comprehended the profound meaning of ice.</p><p>The Infernal White Skeleton, Ember, was an irritable fellow.</p><p>As soon as it appeared, it was as if it had lice all over his body. It scratched up and down and was so excited that it almost performed a bonfire dance.</p><p>When it felt the familiar temperature of the small world in the White Cave, the joy and excitement in its heart completely melted. In the end, it curled up and stuck in its throat that it had to spit it out.</p><p>“Roar –”</p><p>A deafening roar.</p><p>The earth was shaken and cracked, and the ravines were everywhere.</p><p>Gravel flew in all directions, and grass and trees were cut into the air.</p><p>Jiao Tangtang did not have time to react before she was pushed back by the roar for hundreds of feet.</p><p>The great purple chain clanged wildly, and even her gray robe was torn apart.</p><p>“What the hell is this!”</p><p>She subconsciously raised her spiritual source barrier, and the black mist around her body surged. Only then did she dare to look in the direction of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>High in the sky, the Ice Blue White Skeleton half-bent over and crossed its hands.</p><p>Below it, a blue hemisphere-shaped ice shield was in front of Xu Xiaoshou, blocking the roaring attack for him.</p><p>On the other hand, the Infernal White Skeleton was directly behind the two of them, dancing with excitement.</p><p>“Boom, Boom, boom…”</p><p>The earth trembled as it danced, and the ground cracked.</p><p>However, everything in front of her was not as shocking as the waves in Jiao Tangtang’s heart.</p><p>“What… what the… hell is this?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou let out a deep breath and stepped forward. He stepped past the protection of the ice shield and was about to speak.</p><p>“Ka!”</p><p>Another layer of ice shield appeared and blocked his way.</p><p>Clearly, Ice felt the strength of its opponent and could not bear to let Xu Xiaoshou face it alone.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I know what to do.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned to the back before crossing the ice shield again.</p><p>After thinking for a while, he adjusted his posture, leaned against the ice shield, and raised his head 45 degrees.</p><p>At this moment, he felt that something was missing from his hand.</p><p>He calmly used the Three Days Frozen Calamity to condense a wisp of ice smoke.</p><p>The white flame was ignited.</p><p>With a “poof” sound, the mist began to evaporate.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath and exhaled a cloud of icy mist. Then, he said in a neutral tone, “Speak, you can continue what you were saying just now.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang kept clenching her fists so tightly that her nails were deeply embedded in the flesh of her palm.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou looked like he wanted to be beaten up…</p><p>It almost caused her to lose all reason due to her anger that she almost transformed into a ghost beast and wanted to give this fellow’s fair and tender face a ruthless kick in the form of a ghost beast.</p><p>The kind of kick that if Xin Gugu became a puddle of blood that he couldn’t recover from it!</p><p>“How hateful!”</p><p>“Glared At, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang was so angry that smoke was coming out of her body.</p><p>Real smoke, the black kind!</p><p>She really wanted to do that, but she couldn’t.</p><p>The two unknown creatures behind Xu Xiaoshou… the strength of a Sovereign!</p><p>No! Peak Sovereign strength!</p><p>And this was in a one-on-one situation.</p><p>If these two big guys joined hands, she reckoned that even if she transformed into a ghost beast, it was very likely that she would only become a slightly bigger ball that would be wildly kicked by these two fellows!</p><p>Although she had yet to experience the strength of a large white skeleton.</p><p>However, a woman’s sixth sense made Jiao Tangtang realize that she could not afford to offend it!</p><p>Moreover, there was also Xu Xiaoshou who was eyeing her like a tiger eyeing its prey.</p><p>An Innate expert who even Xin Gugu was a little afraid of and had the strength to threaten a ghost beast!</p><p>This…</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what do you mean?”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang took a deep breath and calmed her chest which was trembling from anger. She swallowed her anger and asked.</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finished smoking one ice-cold cigarette at the speed of light. Then, he lit three bigger ones, stuck them between his fourth finger, and took a deep breath.</p><p>“Huff”</p><p>The smoke was spat out, forming a peach heart in the air.</p><p>“Didn’t you say that I have to sign the Ghost Beast Contract today?”</p><p>“Come on, force me.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou put down the large ice cigarette in his hand and his eyes turned cold.</p><p>“What I hate the most in my life is being passive, but what I like the most is also being passive!”</p><p>“Come on, force me. How do you want me to sign it? Give me an explanation.”</p><p>“Say it!”</p><p>As the last sentence was spoken, the ground suddenly sank and collapsed three feet down.</p><p>The heavy pressure in the air caused Ember, who was dancing with joy, to be stunned. It stood properly and placed its hands between the gaps of his fire-breathing legs. It looked like an obedient baby.</p><p>“This aura…”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang’s pupils constricted, and her heart tightened even more.</p><p>She could completely sense that this wave of terrifying aura did not come from the two white skeletons that blotted out the sky, but from Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>This fellow had the ability of a Sovereign. Could he really threaten a ghost beast?</p><p>“Surprised, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Hu.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finished smoking another three cigars.</p><p>Recalling the time when the Flame Python was born and he was beaten to the ground by that ordinary ghost beast, he took a deep breath.</p><p>“Is there enough people?”</p><p>“There’s more if there’s not enough!”</p><p>As he said that, he did not hesitate to put his hand into his pocket. Very quickly, he took out a black stone and threw it on the ground.</p><p>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”</p><p>This time, the Infernal White Skeleton showed fear on its face and retreated a few steps back.</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>A soft cry echoed in the air.</p><p>The sound was not loud, but the penetrating power was very strong.</p><p>Jiao Tangtang felt that her heart was about to stop beating.</p><p>This little boy looked pink and tender, harmless to humans and animals…</p><p>“A Sovereign?”</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points, +1.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
