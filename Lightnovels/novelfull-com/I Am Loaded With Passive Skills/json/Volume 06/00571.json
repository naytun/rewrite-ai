The Terrifying Storyteller</p><p>“Little Wen Ming, what will you do…”</p><p>The Storyteller’s eyes were filled with anticipation and love.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s battle record was too brilliant.</p><p>Even if he didn’t want to admit it, in the ancient book’s space, he had indeed been fooled from beginning to end.</p><p>Now that he thought about it, the Atoryteller actually felt ashamed.</p><p>But at his level, his priorities were very clear.</p><p>He could deceive everyone in the ancient book’s space with a mere Xiantian realm.</p><p>The storyteller knew how much potential Xu Xiaoshou had.</p><p>He knew more than anyone else how important he was!</p><p>In the entire continent, there were very few people who didn’t dare to fight with him.</p><p>But under such circumstances, Xu Xiaoshou was still able to do so..</p><p>It had to be said that at this moment, the reason why he could suppress the shame in his heart and the desire to attack in anger was because of the Atoryteller’s soul, his desire for outstanding young men, and his love for talent.</p><p>“Wen Ming…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“It’s not important anymore!”</p><p>“At this moment, only extreme pressure can squeeze out a person’s true potential!” The Atoryteller thought to himself.</p><p>“Expected, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>Luo Leilei, who was far away, also looked at Xu Xiaoshou, who was a little lost and listless.</p><p>This was the first time he had seen the young man in front of him act like this.</p><p>Usually, no matter what kind of situation he was in, even if the Tianxuan gate was about to collapse, that fellow would still have a calm expression on his face.</p><p>But now..</p><p>“Received concern, passive points + 1.”</p><p>..</p><p>“What should I do? What should I do?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was as anxious as a grasshopper on a hot pot.</p><p>But on the surface, he didn’t show it at all.</p><p>“Since Aenior won’t give me even half a chance…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou enunciated each word and said solemnly, “Then I, Xu Xiaoshou, can only choose to resist.”</p><p>“Brother ~” the Storyteller corrected the young man’s slip of the tongue with a smile.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to delay any longer.</p><p>The White Cave could not be blown up.</p><p>He actually believed that even if he comprehended “Weaving expertise” and communicated with the Order of the Heavens and earth, it would be very difficult to detonate it in a short period of time.</p><p>And during this period of time, it was enough for the storyteller to kill him several times.</p><p>So now..</p><p>Since it was difficult to find a way out, he had no choice but to use his trump card!</p><p>He clenched his fist.</p><p>The Fourth Sword was once again tightly clenched.</p><p>On his body, the devil vein that had just retreated appeared once again.</p><p>Looking at the Storyteller’s expectant eyes, Xu Xiaoshou slowly raised the vicious sword in his hand.</p><p>“Are we really going to fight?”</p><p>The Storyteller raised his eyebrows, unmoved in the slightest.</p><p>In his eyes, Xu Xiaoshou was able to escape the Night Guardian’s pursuit purely because the other party had some scruples.</p><p>But was the ability to Cut Path really that simple?</p><p>Taking ten thousand steps back, he was a storyteller, but he did not have any misgivings at all!</p><p>A cooked duck, could it still grow wings and fly?</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou roared angrily, raising his Fourth Sword and was about to slash down.</p><p>The Storyteller’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Luo Leilei hurriedly retreated, giving way to the battlefield.</p><p>But just as the two of them were looking forward to it, Xu Xiaoshou, who was in the distance, slashed down with his sword, but there was not a single ripple.</p><p>The void trembled.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who seemed like he was facing a great enemy, who seemed like he was about to fight with blood, suddenly disappeared.</p><p>“It’s that vanishing technique again?”</p><p>“Suspected, passive points + 1.”</p><p>The Storyteller was stunned for a moment.</p><p>He immediately raised his hand and sealed the space.</p><p>“Little Wen Ming, don’t try anymore. Your move is fresh, but what about the spiritual source?”</p><p>The Storyteller smiled and advised, “You can’t break this space. I can’t see you now, but can you get out?”</p><p>..</p><p>Who cares, run!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou only wanted to take the easy way out.</p><p>Fight?</p><p>What a joke!</p><p>Don’t you know what you’re capable of?</p><p>As soon as he activated the vanishing technique, he immediately followed suit.</p><p>However, he suddenly realized that his teleportation was able to run nearly a mile.</p><p>At this moment, he was more than a hundred feet away, and it was as if he had hit a wall.</p><p>It came to an abrupt stop!</p><p>The atmosphere was somewhat awkward and solemn.</p><p>A drop of cold sweat slid down from the corner of his brows.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s little heart fell straight to the bottom.</p><p>“As expected… It won’t work.”</p><p>Although he had long been prepared, when this result arrived, Xu Xiaoshou still realized that death was about to arrive.</p><p>The Storyteller was right.</p><p>The “Vanishing technique” was powerful, but it was not invincible.</p><p>When his spiritual source was exhausted, it was the moment when he died and his path vanished!</p><p>And now, this space was once again banished?</p><p>There was no way out!</p><p>“I don’t have time to waste…”</p><p>His thoughts spun wildly in his mind. At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou could no longer find a countermeasure that could solve the difficult problem in front of him from his own perspective.</p><p>He finally took out the tightly clenched stone-shaped Aje from his chest.</p><p>“Jie Bao, I might really not be able to pass this test for Ma Ma…”</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>Aje in his hand trembled, and then a red light flashed.</p><p>In the next second, he transformed into a little boy and appeared directly in front of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Aje, who was more than a head lower than his own Ma Ma, suddenly opened his hands and cut off the front and back, as if he had opened up a brand new world.</p><p>“Protected, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not even touched in the slightest.</p><p>There was only guilt in his heart.</p><p>Aje did have the power of the higher void, but it was indeed too void.</p><p>That kind of unstable ability, whether or not it could be released again, if it was really released, would it be able to withstand the storyteller’s combat strength?</p><p>In the past, although Aje was said to be strong in the face of strength.</p><p>Theoretically, there was a limit to how strong he could be.</p><p>If Aje was really a divine puppet that could contend against a peak-stage Path Cutting level expert who had transcended the Nine Death Thunder Calamity.</p><p>Would it be purely confined in the Tianxuan Gate and treated coldly?</p><p>There were no fools in Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>There must be someone who knew Aje’s value.</p><p>If it could not be taken out, then it meant two problems:</p><p>One, he did not dare.</p><p>Two, he was not worthy!</p><p>And with Elder Sang around, what else could he not dare?</p><p>Then..</p><p>“Aje!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou reached out and put his hand on Aje’s shoulder, his eyes revealing his determination.</p><p>He could stand up for Xin Gugu and face a few of the great cutting path and a dozen sovereign thrones alone.</p><p>At this moment, there was no reason to throw away the more intimate ring treasure and let him take care of the rear and leave by himself.</p><p>“Hold on for a while. It’ll only take a little while…”</p><p>“Ma Ma, I want to try something big.”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou only had madness left in his heart!</p><p>..</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>He saw a little boy wearing a straw hat and hemp clothes suddenly appear in the direction where the young man had disappeared.</p><p>Surprise flashed across the Storyteller’s eyes.</p><p>“It’s him again?”</p><p>This thought only flashed through his mind, but the Storyteller immediately rejected it.</p><p>The aura on this little boy’s body..</p><p>No.</p><p>There was no aura at all.</p><p>This was a dead object!</p><p>“Divine puppet?”</p><p>Staring for half a breath, the storyteller’s eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s divine puppet, that Little Wen Ming, also had it?</p><p>“Good guy!”</p><p>At this moment, the Storyteller’s desire for Wen Ming had risen to an unparalleled level.</p><p>He licked his bright red lips and said, “Little Brother, you, I’m definitely going to have him!”</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>Aje muttered softly. A red light flashed in his eyes. He did not fail his mission.</p><p>Xiu.</p><p>He disappeared in an instant.</p><p>When he reappeared, he had already landed behind the Storyteller.</p><p>“So fast!”</p><p>The Storyteller subconsciously lowered his body. The sound of wind above his head instantly exploded.</p><p>Aje swung his leg.</p><p>Seeing that there was no result, he directly twisted his body, and with a twist of his body, his elbow struck towards the low altitude.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The void was directly exploded.</p><p>However, the Storyteller had already bent his calves, and his entire body bounced up high.</p><p>He even had the leisure to lean over, and directly picked up Aje’s straw hat, and touched his smooth head along the way.</p><p>“It has temperature?”</p><p>Slightly startled, theStoryteller was somewhat dumbfounded.</p><p>This was simply like a living person, completely different from the reckless divine puppet he had seen before.</p><p>“Ma Ma!”</p><p>Aje was furious.</p><p>The red light in his eyes gradually changed to a scarlet red.</p><p>In just two moves, he had already sensed that this human in front of him was too strong.</p><p>At that time, his invincible close-range attack had been completely dodged by his opponent.</p><p>Then, it was time to change the fighting method!</p><p>“Wu –”</p><p>The pores all over her body bloomed.</p><p>An extremely high and ear-piercing high decibel sound suddenly spread in all directions.</p><p>Luo Leilei, who had retreated to the rear, did not have time to react for a moment. She was directly pierced by this sound until her pores exploded, and blood directly flowed out of her ears.</p><p>“What sound is that!”</p><p>She immediately sealed her six senses, but that sound wave attack was omnipresent, directly penetrating through her body.</p><p>His sea of energy reserve instantly surged.</p><p>Even his soul seemed to be directly pierced through by this sound.</p><p>Luo Leilei immediately put on the mask of pain.</p><p>“Way of the Heavens!”</p><p>The Storyteller was also stabbed in mid-air until he was slightly dazed.</p><p>But in a flash, he reacted. With a wave of his hand, he cut off the way of the heavens in the space where Luo Leilei was, protecting her.</p><p>But in just this one moment of delay, Aje’s fist had already enlarged in his pupils.</p><p>“Very strong…”</p><p>The Storyteller’s red lips curled up.</p><p>He didn’t even choose to dodge. Just the space in front of him slightly distorted, and his face seemed to have sunken.</p><p>Then, in front of the folded space, Aje’s fist directly brushed past the Storyteller’s skin.</p><p>It didn’t injure him in the slightest!</p><p>It seemed to only be a millimeter away, but in reality..</p><p>“Open.”</p><p>The Storyteller’s pearly teeth opened slightly, and he smiled casually.</p><p>The folded space before the smooth skin on his cheeks was released, and Aje’s fist was instantly bounced back a few feet away.</p><p>“Little Brother, you want to touch me too?”</p><p>The Storyteller stretched out his hand with a charming smile, and his head exploded.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The space directly exploded.</p><p>The terrifying explosive impact directly hit Aje’s forehead.</p><p>With a boom, the hemp clothes on Aje’s body directly shattered, and Aje’s body was sent flying several hundred feet away.</p><p>“So hard…”</p><p>The Storyteller looked at his middle finger in shock.</p><p>The part of his fingernail had been completely bruised.</p><p>After many encounters with the white-clothed, the Storyteller had actually come into contact with the divine puppet many times. He naturally knew that this kind of existence basically had a steel body that was comparable to a sovereign physique.</p><p>However, he had long been prepared. What his brain had collapsed was not Aje’s body, but space!</p><p>However!</p><p>The recoil from the recoil had actually injured him..</p><p>“You’ve angered me!”</p><p>Looking at the cracked fingernails, the beautiful patterns on the nail polish had already been corroded. The Storyteller’s expression became sullen.</p><p>Without any pause, he took out the “Yin Yang Life and Death Trap”, turned around and ruthlessly whipped it toward the sky behind him.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Aje, who had arrived behind the Storyteller in an instant and was about to punch him, was whipped into the sky before he could even react.</p><p>“The battle awareness of a cultivator at the peak of the first realm… is very strong.”</p><p>The Storyteller clicked his tongue in surprise and then changed the topic. “But he is at the second realm. Your reaction and speed are nothing in his eyes!”</p><p>With a look in his eyes, the Storyteller formed a seal with his fingers.</p><p>“Rustle, Rustle, Rustle…”</p><p>The Yin Yang Life and Death Trap floated in the air. The pages of the book moved without the wind and automatically flipped. Rustling sounds reverberated in the lonely void in all directions.</p><p>“Netherworld Dragon Head!”</p><p>The Storyteller pointed with his finger. The pages of the book stopped flipping and landed on a blank page.</p><p>In the next moment, a hieroglyph with golden light appeared on it.</p><p>The words converged and turned into a ferocious dragon head that leaped onto the paper.</p><p>The sky and earth suddenly turned dark, as if there was something that could blot out the sun, blocking the scarlet sky of the White Cave.</p><p>“Roar –”</p><p>A loud and clear dragon roar rose from the high sky, stopping the moving clouds.</p><p>At this moment, even the curtain of rain that was constantly falling on the horizon seemed to be directly interrupted.</p><p>“Confine!”</p><p>The Storyteller pulled with his hand, and the dark dragon head that was thousands of feet in size that descended from the sky opened its mouth wide and fell down.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Aje, who had been sent flying, did not have time to resist and landed between the steel teeth of the dragon’s mouth.</p><p>The space within a radius of several kilometers that had been restored to its original state exploded in an instant.</p><p>The law of the Order of the Heavens appeared, and the White Cave was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>The Storyteller flipped the page again and pointed with his slender finger.</p><p>“Condense.”</p><p>Golden Hieroglyphs jumped out of the page. With a flick of the storyteller’s sleeve, they merged into this world.</p><p>The turmoil in the White Cave immediately stabilized.</p><p>However, in midair, Aje, who was restrained by the dragon head, could not escape no matter how hard he struggled.</p><p>..</p><p>“Damn it…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had not even had the time to form the high-intensity, compressed form of “Song of Ice and Fire” that he had used for the sacrificial refining. When he saw this scene, his heart was about to break.</p><p>“Ma Ma!”</p><p>“Ma Ma!”</p><p>Aje was clearly not calling for help, but struggling loudly.</p><p>But at this moment, in Xu Xiaoshou’s ears, it was a sign that his own child had been bullied.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but take a step into the sky. He held up the ice and fire energy to compress the light dot. On the one hand, he tried his best to control the energy balance of the light dot so that it would not explode.</p><p>On the other hand, he ruthlessly stabbed the Fourth Sword into the Dark Dragon’s head.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The dragon’s head shook violently.</p><p>The Storyteller’s eyes moved.</p><p>What did he see?</p><p>The Green Light Netherworld Dragon’s head, which had always been successful, was actually dyed black by the black patterns at this moment?</p><p>He could not see Xu Xiaoshou in his Vanishing technique state.</p><p>However, with the scene before him, it was not difficult to see that Xu Xiaoshou had already made his move!</p><p>He still used Fourth Swords!</p><p>“Take the easy way out!”</p><p>The corners of his mouth curled up slightly, and he didn’t say anything else.</p><p>The Storyteller directly reduced the area of the spatial confinement and locked down the area of a hundred feet around the Netherworld Dragon’s head.</p><p>“Take the easy way out!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finished his job and wanted to escape, but he realized that this move was already useless.</p><p>Although the “Vanishing technique” had the penetration attribute.</p><p>However, the imprisonment of the Storyteller was not completely controlled by the space.</p><p>He used another method of exile to completely abandon a certain space from the Way of the Heavens.</p><p>This caused Xu Xiaoshou, who was in the exiled space, to feel as if he was being held by the Storyteller… the world was vast and there was nowhere to go!</p><p>“Several hundred feet…”</p><p>“Dozens of feet…”</p><p>“Then dozens of feet, then dozens of feet…”</p><p>With a thought, Xu Xiaoshou instantly understood the Storyteller’s thoughts.</p><p>Every time he moved, the other party would be able to compress the area.</p><p>And if he moved too many times, when the banished dimension was reduced to only a few feet, or even a few feet..</p><p>“The Vanishing technique will lose its effectiveness indirectly!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who understood everything, felt a wave of shock in his heart.</p><p>This was incredible!</p><p>This pervert in a red dress had incredible battle awareness!</p><p>He couldn’t see.</p><p>He used a spatial compression technique, and when he was confined to a small area of space..</p><p>Did It matter if he could see or not?</p><p>The turtle was in the jar.</p><p>It was only a matter of time before he pulled in the net!</p><p>“Damn it, I met a tough guy…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p>He felt the grim reaper beckoning at him.</p><p>When did the Storyteller lose his playful heart? Did It mean that he was already on the verge of death?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
