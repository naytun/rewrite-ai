This should be his Wen Ming.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu sighed and revealed an expression of ‘as expected’.</p><p>When the masked man heard this, his heart was filled with excitement. He was suddenly stunned and reacted. His face became stern, “At this juncture, you still want to play tricks with me, right?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s passion was extinguished on the spot.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?” The masked man asked back, “You want to fool me? Does this count? Swear on Wen Ming!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou:”…”</p><p>“My name is really Xu…”</p><p>“Wen Ming!”</p><p>“OH.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless and said sadly, “Saint Servant, I, Wen Ming, choose to join…”</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes.”</p><p>Only then did the masked man nod his head in satisfaction. He patted the shoulder of the young man in front of him and said, “Your command token is mine. Keep it for now. I’ll carve another one for you when I’m free later.”</p><p>“Theoretically speaking, I still have some connections in the mainland.”</p><p>“Although I don’t know what kind of enemies you will meet in the future, if you really can’t solve anything, you can try to take out the command token. Maybe the Dragon King Temple will be flooded and the other party may choose to let you go.”</p><p>“Like this?” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up and asked, “What about Red Robed and White-clothed?”</p><p>“I advise you not to.”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu silently added, “You’d better find a chance to destroy it. If you really take it out, you will only die an even more miserable death.”</p><p>The masked man was amused. “Yes, taking out the command token also depends on the situation.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: “…”</p><p>This.</p><p>Then what was the use of this command token?</p><p>Seeing the young man in front of him suddenly look a little disgusted, the masked man added, “But if it’s a situation where death is inevitable, we can give it a try.”</p><p>“One will die an even more tragic death, and the other might be able to escape. It gives us a bit more hope, doesn’t it?”</p><p>“Yes.” Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and quietly put away the command token.</p><p>“Then, welcome to join us.”</p><p>The masked man released his hand, feeling as if he had accomplished something important. He turned to look at the storyteller and said, “Let me introduce you.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also turned his head to look.</p><p>He knew that the other party was probably going to introduce him to the internal situation of the Saint Servant.</p><p>The Storyteller pouted, but he did not refuse.</p><p>“The Saint Servant has a total of ten chairs, each representing the ten people with the strongest combat strength. They are scattered across the continent, each carrying out different missions.”</p><p>“He is ranked seventh, which means he is the seventh chief of the Saint Servant.”</p><p>The Storyteller pointed at the masked man and said, “This is the chief of the Saint Servant. As you know, he is ranked first. The organization of the Saint Servant was created by him.”</p><p>The eyes of the masked man slightly flickered, and he slightly puffed out his chest.</p><p>The Storyteller pointed at Cen Qiaofu again. The latter stood up straight, and his aura also straightened up.</p><p>“This old man… the fourth-in-command of the Saint Servant. He’s just a little older, nothing special.”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s face immediately darkened. “Storyteller, what do you mean?”</p><p>“That’s what I mean. You just came in earlier than me. It’s not a big deal.”</p><p>The Storyteller curled his lips. “If he could live for so many years, his strength would definitely not be at his current level.”</p><p>“You!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu pulled out his hatchet.</p><p>“Hey, there’s still a rookie here.” The masked man suddenly glared at Cen Qiaofu. Cen Qiaofu then blew his beard and glared at him as he put down his hand.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou listened until his hair stood on end.</p><p>“Fourth?”</p><p>“Fourth is Higher Void. Then the one in front…”</p><p>He suddenly thought of Elder Sang. “Oh right, the second-in-command of the Saint Servant?”</p><p>“That is your master.”</p><p>The Storyteller continued, “He is ranked second. He is also experienced, but he has known Elder Brother for a long time.”</p><p>“What about his strength?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that there was something wrong with the strength of this organization.</p><p>The Fourth was Higher Void.</p><p>Shouldn’t the top three be even stronger?</p><p>However, Elder Sang felt that he was only as strong as a sovereign the first time!</p><p>Even Cutting Path was a little weak.</p><p>“Power…”</p><p>The Storyteller frowned. “It’s hard to say. We haven’t seen each of them for a long time, and their power is fluctuating.”</p><p>“Some are rising, some are injured, and some are falling. They are very unstable.”</p><p>“But you only need to know that your master was more than ten years ago… more than ten years ago, right?”</p><p>The Storyteller turned around and glanced at the masked man. Seeing that he was completely confused, he said to himself, “In any case, it wasn’t more than ten years ago. It was more than ten years ago.”</p><p>“He was already able to fight with Gou Wuyue!”</p><p>This..</p><p>Although Xu Xiaoshou already had some confidence, when Elder Sang’s true strength was recognized from the mouth of an expert of the current age, he still felt shocked.</p><p>Gou Wuyue was also one of the Seven Sword Deities.</p><p>The sword deity was the peak of combat strength in the Higher Void.</p><p>Elder Sang had already reached this realm more than ten years ago?</p><p>Then when he was in Tiansang Spirit Palace..</p><p>“He’s injured.”</p><p>The Storyteller knew what Wen Ming was thinking and said, “Even if he can injure Gou Wuyue in the battle, the might of the sword deity is not so easy to bear.”</p><p>“After that battle, he lost the Saint Servant’s largest stronghold in the central region, and his strength almost fell from the sovereign’s throne.”</p><p>“Fortunately, he returned to the eastern region and seemed to have found a medicine that could restore his realm. Over the years, he slowly improved.”</p><p>“I see…” Xu Xiaoshou nodded and asked, “What about the others?”</p><p>He stole a glance at Cen Qiaofu. “If the Fourth is Higher Void, then who is the Third? and the strength of the others…”</p><p>“I won’t say much about that.”</p><p>The masked man interrupted, “Anyway, you only need to know that the ten chairs of the Saint Servant are not made of hollow wood. They are real.”</p><p>“Every chair is placed in a certain place, and there will be a great turmoil in that place. For that, it is the ultimate goal.”</p><p>“As for whether we are afraid of the others…”</p><p>The masked man paused for a moment as if he was thinking. After a long while, he said, “Let’s put it this way. Including the Storyteller who is about to break through, almost all of the ten chairs of the Saint Servant are about to be filled with air.”</p><p>“Filled with air?” Xu Xiaoshou did not understand.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>The masked man nodded. “The power of the Higher Void.”</p><p>“Hiss.”</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>Ten, ten Higher Void?</p><p>“This is only the power on the surface.”</p><p>The masked man smiled and said, “In the dark, there are still many people who can not be contacted, but they are all the same as our ultimate goal.”</p><p>“They are waiting, and so are we.”</p><p>“Waiting for a suitable opportunity, I reckon that we can completely break out of this world’s cage.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was secretly speechless, but he could not help but ask, “What is the ultimate goal?”</p><p>“That is your goal.”</p><p>The masked man sighed, “If you don’t become a saint, you will become a slave!”</p><p>Slave?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt the shackles in his brain being lifted, and he seemed to understand something.</p><p>In the past, he could always feel the existence of this layer of imprisonment, but he could not say it. It was difficult to understand what kind of feeling it was.</p><p>But now..</p><p>“Saint Servant, Saint Servant. If I don’t become a Saint, I’ll become a Servant?”</p><p>“So that’s what it means?”</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>He was wandering around and hitting a wall everywhere. Wasn’t it the true portrayal of him not being strong enough and only being a slave?</p><p>Those powerhouses who killed their way through the chess game, no matter how impressive they looked, weren’t they just chess pieces under someone else’s hand, a “Servant”?</p><p>“If you don’t become a Saint, you will become a Servant…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou murmured and asked, “What is a Saint?”</p><p>He thought of the wretched saint.</p><p>If he became a Saint, could he really leave the slave registry?</p><p>The masked man paced with his hands behind his back. He looked up at the drizzling rain and said, “Saint means a Saint.”</p><p>“Subdivided into Higher Void realms, which are demi-saint and tenth level Holy Emperor.”</p><p>“At this stage, you can be considered to have half a foot on the top of the world…”</p><p>The masked man replied with an “En” and added, “Truly, the top of the world!”</p><p>Half a foot… Xu Xiaoshou heard his voice and the wretched saint’s image flashed in his mind again. He could not help but ask, “Then, once you become a saint, can you really be free?”</p><p>As soon as he said this, Cen Qiaofu, the Storyteller, and even the masked man looked at him in surprise.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a few steps back in fear. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>“To be able to ask such a question…”</p><p>The masked man seemed to be deep in thought. “Have you seen someone before?”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“Where’s your Flame Python? Let me take a look.” The masked man reached out his hand.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated for a moment and refused to take it out.</p><p>“Membership fee?”</p><p>This was too expensive!</p><p>Black lines appeared on the forehead of the masked man. “No! I just want to take a look.”</p><p>“OH.”</p><p>Only then did Xu Xiaoshou reluctantly take out the famed sword, Flame Python.</p><p>“It’s really it…”</p><p>The Masked Man took the famed sword.</p><p>The famed sword trembled violently in an instant, but after it was stroked by his palm, it actually quieted down completely and let out a joyous cry.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was surprised, but he didn’t say anything.</p><p>Famed sword recognized its master, so it would naturally reject others.</p><p>But if the person in front of him was really..</p><p>“Why would it listen to you?” Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but be curious.</p><p>He remembered that when he touched Su Qianqian’s Epitaph of City Snow, the sword flew back to its master without giving him a chance.</p><p>However, the masked man couldn’t help but laugh, “Well, the famed sword is also psychic. If you want to make friends with it, it naturally won’t object.”</p><p>“Is it really that simple?” Xu Xiaoshou was a little suspicious.</p><p>“Of course not.”</p><p>The masked man smiled and handed the sword back, “But if I really want to make friends with it, would it dare to refuse?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou choked to death.</p><p>When he received the sword, he could actually feel a sense of relief from the Flame Python.</p><p>Was this sword nervous in the masked man’s hand just now?</p><p>“There is such a wisp of aura.”</p><p>The masked man tightened his fingers and turned to Cen Qiaofu. “It’s him.”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu nodded.</p><p>Even if he didn’t believe it in his heart, he completely understood at this moment.</p><p>This young man in front of him probably had more potential than what he had seen.</p><p>It was fine if the chief monk had taken a fancy to him.</p><p>But the Holy Emperor of Abyss Island had actually taken a fancy to this person?</p><p>Terrifying!</p><p>“What do you mean? What secrets do you have that others don’t know?” The Storyteller saw the two of them flirting with each other in front of him and could not help but get angry.</p><p>However, the masked man did not explain. Instead, he looked at Xu Xiaoshou and answered the question he had just asked.</p><p>“Becoming a Saint does not necessarily mean that you can break out of the cage.”</p><p>“After all, there are more than one pair of eyes staring at you from the sky.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his head again and saw the curtain of rain.</p><p>He already knew that the masked man was not lying.</p><p>After all, the “being watched” in the Information Bar that refreshed every once in a while basically came from the Rain Curtain in the White Cave. There was no other explanation.</p><p>“It’s hard to cry alone, but it’s also hard to destroy mountains.”</p><p>The masked man stared at the Rain Curtain of the Nine Heavens and said seriously, “The cage that the only saint can’t break. Once there are more of them, they won’t be able to hold them.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that it was somewhat absurd.</p><p>It was already very difficult for a demi-saint.</p><p>In this world, how could there be so many saints for you to find and still be able to organize?</p><p>It was a fantasy!</p><p>However, he thought about it again and recalled what the masked man had said.</p><p>How many talents were there in the world?</p><p>Was it true that everyone could only stop at the Cutting Path and the Higher Void?</p><p>There were even more.</p><p>How could the Hallmaster Dao of the Holy Divine Palace, who was only a demi-saint, be above the world?</p><p>Wasn’t the Holy Emperor the peak of combat strength in this world?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had already understood the situation of some of the peak powerhouses in the Shengshen Continent, doubted this statement for the first time.</p><p>Either Dao Qiongcang was not just a demi-saint state.</p><p>Or Caramel’s metaphor was not a metaphor!</p><p>“I have one more question. One last question.” Seeing the masked man’s expression, Xu Xiaoshou spoke again.</p><p>“Speak.”</p><p>The masked man averted his gaze from the Rain Curtain of the Nine Heavens. He really didn’t want to say anymore.</p><p>But the last question..</p><p>Forget it, let’s answer it again!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held the Flame Python in his hand. Su Qianqian’s figure that seemed to have grown overnight after the sword was snatched flashed through his mind. For a moment, he didn’t know how to speak.</p><p>“What question?” The masked man turned around.</p><p>“The sword.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paused for a moment and asked resolutely, “If it’s the famed sword, why did you… Take it away?”</p><p>“Famed sword?”</p><p>The masked man looked at the flame python in his hand, not understanding what was going on.</p><p>“Epitaph of City Snow!” Xu Xiaoshou looked as if he was ready to die.</p><p>“Oh, you mean it…”</p><p>The masked man was amused and said, “Just like you, it couldn’t withstand the sword-bearer. In the end, it had to give up the famed sword. It just so happened that I needed this power.”</p><p>“I’ll say it again. Instead of falling into someone else’s hands, why don’t you hand it over to me for the time being, understand?”</p><p>For the time being..</p><p>Was that really the case?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of Su Qianqian’s pain and looked at the masked man, who didn’t seem to be in a bad mood. He asked again, “But why did you kill everyone in the Su Family?”</p><p>This time, the Storyteller and Cen Qiaofu raised their eyebrows at the same time.</p><p>After Xu Xiaoshou finished his question, he felt that the atmosphere was a little strange. He took a step back and blocked the Flame Python in front of his chest.</p><p>“Ha.”</p><p>The masked man laughed and didn’t care at all.</p><p>“Kill?”</p><p>“No, not to mention that I didn’t kill everyone. I only killed a few people who dared to attack me.”</p><p>“Just at that level, it can’t be called ‘kill’. Such a serious word.”</p><p>“Mm.” Xu Xiaoshou’s tone was sinking, but his expression was one of doubt.</p><p>He did not say much, quietly waiting for the masked man to continue.</p><p>“I actually don’t like killing people.” The masked man spread his hands.</p><p>He actually did not want to explain.</p><p>But he guessed that if Wen Ming also knew the sword-bearer in Tiansang Spirit Palace, it would be a knot in his heart, so he had to say it.</p><p>“Do you know what is the greatest honor for a true swordsman?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head.</p><p>The masked man continued, “The greatest honor is to die under my sword.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: “…”</p><p>“I’m not lying to you.”</p><p>The masked man looked at him and said seriously, “They choose to defend, and I choose to fulfill them. If you want to understand it as killing, that’s fine. After all, that’s the truth.”</p><p>“Of course, you won’t understand if I tell you this now.”</p><p>“When you can fully understand it, it will be when you truly grasp the way of the sword. At that time, I welcome you to ‘fulfill’ me…”</p><p>“If you dare to attack me.”</p><p>There was a relieved smile in the masked man’s eyes. There was a hint of respect and admiration for his opponent at that time.</p><p>“I can only explain this much to you.”</p><p>“If you really want to fully understand the situation, perhaps you can understand it by making a trip to the Su family in person.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fell silent.</p><p>He really could not understand it.</p><p>He clearly wanted to snatch the sword and even killed all the higher-ups of the sword-bearer’s family. He could actually say it in such a dignified manner.</p><p>However, on second thought, he had exchanged blows with the Saint Servant several times.</p><p>The sentence that the other party shouted the most seemed to be “Don’t hurt anyone”..</p><p>Looking at the awe-inspiring righteousness on the masked man’s body, it did not seem like he was lying either.</p><p>“Are you sure you’re not making this up?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“I’m sure,” the masked man answered.</p><p>“You said yes.”</p><p>“HMM?” The masked man raised his eyebrows.</p><p>The corner of the Storyteller’s mouth also twitched.</p><p>The tone of this order almost made him unable to restrain himself from attacking.</p><p>The masked man did not say “Yes.”.</p><p>“When you have the real strength to verify whether what I said is true or not, I might answer you with this tone.”</p><p>“But now…”</p><p>The masked man’s turbid eyes contained a smile, but his voice was very serious. “In this world, indeed, no one dares to order me like this.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a chill in his heart.</p><p>He really was just used to using it unconsciously. He wanted to conveniently make use of the masked man’s words and let the Information Bar verify it.</p><p>But it was fruitless.</p><p>Forget it.</p><p>See!</p><p>Seriously going to death, killing and respect, the glory of a swordsman..</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that it was very funny.</p><p>But when these words came out of the masked man’s mouth, he had another misconception that it was originally like this.</p><p>He was unable to determine whether this person was confident or just speaking his own words.</p><p>However, it was clear that he was now in the great whirlpool of the Saint Servant.</p><p>Su Qianqian alone, with such a small obsession, was unable to shake the overall situation.</p><p>“Su family, huh…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered softly to himself and did not pursue the matter further.</p><p>He had become a Saint Servant.</p><p>However, he still had to see his own path clearly, no matter how flowery the other party’s words were.</p><p>Indeed, to put it bluntly, this was only a ‘choice’.</p><p>And under this choice, if he could be given more time…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou believed that in the near future, even a Saint Servant would want to use a cage to frame him. At that time, he reckoned that he wouldn’t be able to restrain himself.</p><p>“What I need is only time.”</p><p>“Time will also prove everything. Whether you are the masked man, the chief of the Saint Servant, or… the Eighth Sword Deity?”</p><p>He felt relieved.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked up at the sky.</p><p>“What’s the next step? How do I go?”</p><p>The masked man twisted his body and took a step forward. The storyteller and Cen Qiaofu immediately followed.</p><p>“Use your feet.”</p><p>Thud.</p><p>The masked man raised his foot and lightly stepped on the ground. Behind him, the Fourth Sword suddenly trembled and flew over again.</p><p>“Go back.”</p><p>He gently tilted his head.</p><p>The momentum of the vicious sword froze on the spot and stopped in front of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened his hand. He thought about it but did not dare to.</p><p>“Hold it. When you can get this sword to recognize you as its master, then you have the right to ask me questions.”</p><p>“OH.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grasped it.</p><p>The vicious sword actually did not resist. It quieted down again, as if..</p><p>The anger had already been vented.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wanted to follow the footsteps of the three people, but the information bar jumped again.</p><p>“Watched, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Isn’t it important, him?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the sky. “If this is a pair of eyes, can he hear what we said just now?”</p><p>“If he can see, he naturally has the ability to hear.” The masked man didn’t even turn his head.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly woke up and was a little scared.</p><p>“Then why did you say so much?”</p><p>He turned his head and looked at the storyteller. “So we are actually in the ancient book’s space, and ‘his’ vision is blocked by you?”</p><p>“No.” The Storyteller shook his head. “We have always been in the White Cave world.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: “…”</p><p>This perverted man really made it hard for him to understand reality and fantasy realm.</p><p>“But, is it okay to be heard?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was panicking. What the masked man had said just now was an extremely big secret!</p><p>About ten higher void..</p><p>If this news spread to the Shengshen Continent, the entire world would probably be in turmoil, right?</p><p>If White-clothed and Red Robed came out together, the Holy Divine Palace would also make up their minds to surround and annihilate the Saint Servant.</p><p>If he chose to join at this time, wouldn’t he be courting death?</p><p>“It’s not a problem.”</p><p>The masked man waved his hand indifferently. Step by step, he slowly but firmly walked forward towards scarlet.</p><p>“After the matter of the White Cave is settled, we naturally have to go out.”</p><p>“What are we staying here for? Are we waiting to die of old age?”</p><p>“And outside, you should know that there’s still a large group of people waiting for us.”</p><p>“Those words just now weren’t just meant for you to hear.”</p><p>“Huh?” Xu Xiaoshou’s raised foot paused.</p><p>The masked man’s relaxed and carefree voice drifted over from the front.</p><p>“It was also meant for Gou Wuyue to hear.”</p><p>Pa..</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s foot landed heavily on the ground, but he could no longer lift it up.</p><p>He raised his eyes in astonishment as he looked at the Rain Curtain of the Nine Heavens, which was still unmoved. His expression was complicated, and he did not know what expression he should squeeze out.</p><p>On purpose?</p><p>Declare war?</p><p>He looked at this world of the White Cave, which was on the verge of destruction. Other than the Night Guardian, who was still bitterly holding on, there was no one there.</p><p>If the words of the masked man were said to Gou Wuyue…</p><p>Then..</p><p>“The Shengshen Continent is really going to be restless!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
