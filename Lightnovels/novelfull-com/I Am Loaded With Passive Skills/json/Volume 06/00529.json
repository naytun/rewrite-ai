Continue?” Xu Xiaoshou lifted his chin.</p><p>The corners of Jiao Tangtang’s eyes twitched wildly, and the black mist on her body suddenly rose to a height of 30 feet.</p><p>“Oh my God, wait, wait!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. “It was a slip of the tongue, a slip of the tongue. Actually, I didn’t want to fight with you either. It’s good that everyone is communicating at such a distance.”</p><p>Seeing that the lady was about to charge at him, Xu Xiaoshou quickly admitted defeat.</p><p>This was a ghost beast!</p><p>If they could communicate calmly, he wouldn’t want to start a real fight either.</p><p>Otherwise, if his two new bodyguards were killed before they could get to know one another, Xu Xiaoshou’s heart would ache to death.</p><p>“Phew!”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang took a deep breath and said angrily, “Xu Xiaoshou, if you say another word of nonsense, do you believe that I will really risk my life to chop you into pieces today?”</p><p>“I don’t believe it…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head subconsciously, but when he saw the flushed face on the other side, he quickly changed his words, “I believe it, I believe it, I believe in Jesus!”</p><p>“Glared At, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“So what do you say?”</p><p>The other party remained silent, and the atmosphere was extremely tense as if it was about to explode at any moment. Xu Xiaoshou could not help but force himself to speak, “There’s an important principle that I don’t know if I should speak of…”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>“Alright.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded and continued, “It’s this Ghost Beast Contract, I really can’t sign it with you…”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang angrily took a step forward.</p><p>“Protect me.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately retreated behind the ice shield and directly pulled Aje in front of him.</p><p>“This is the principle!” He stuck his head out and shouted.</p><p>“Hiss.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang took a deep breath and calmed her breathing. She ignored the young man’s words and continued, “Xu Xiaoshou, I’m not really forcing you to sign the Ghost Beast Contract…”</p><p>“This isn’t forcing? Do you have some misunderstanding about the word ‘force’?”</p><p>“Shut up!” Jiao Tangtang scolded angrily, “Hear me out!”</p><p>“Oh.” Xu Xiaoshou finally shut up.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Jiao Tangtang changed the topic, “Xu Xiaoshou, do you know the truth about ghost beasts?”</p><p>“Oh?” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The truth?</p><p>Yes, the woman in front of him seemed to be an organized and well-connected ghost beast host body.</p><p>With his previous confusion about the Red Coat and the ghost beast, it seemed like he may be able to find a breakthrough from her?</p><p>There were many thoughts in his mind, but Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to say it.</p><p>“Say something!” Jiao Tangtang’s eyes widened.</p><p>“Didn’t you tell me to shut up?” Xu Xiaoshou shrunk his head.</p><p>“Chi!”</p><p>This time, the large purple chain on Jiao Tangtang’s body seemed to be unable to suppress the black mist that was gushing out.</p><p>The ground was directly invaded by the sinister force. The eyes of the furious woman turned scarlet red.</p><p>“Not to the extent, not to the extent…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly became nervous. “I am so confused. You told me to shut up and yet you want me to speak. What do you want me to do? I’m also very helpless!”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>The black mist that was rising from Jiao Tangtang started to tremble.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The Infernal White Skeleton let out a low roar that was filled with hostility. It calmed her down at the right time.</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>She glanced at him again and saw that the little boy who refused to leave Xu Xiaoshou’s side was right beside him.</p><p>Obviously, it was not realistic to rush forward and give him a good beating.</p><p>If they started an internal war, it would only benefit the others and be a waste of effort.</p><p>“I’ll endure!”</p><p>“Jiao Tangtang, endure! This is Xu Xiaoshou. It’s not like you’re not used to his way of speaking. Endure!”</p><p>After comforting herself in her heart, Jiao Tangtang pressed down with both of her hands and withdrew the ghost beast’s black mist into her body.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, don’t joke with me anymore. There’s a limit to my patience.”</p><p>Ignoring the young man’s reaction, she immediately continued, “The ghost beast is not as simple as you think. You should know that I come from a place called the Xu Yue Grey Palace.”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded and did not dare to play around anymore.</p><p>Obviously, Jiao Tangtang wanted to reveal some insider information.</p><p>“Your what palace is a pure ghost beast force?” Xu Xiaoshou asked uncertainly.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>After getting a positive answer, Xu Xiaoshou was a little surprised.</p><p>He had this suspicion when he saw Xin Gugu and Jiao Tangtang.</p><p>However, after seeing the iron-blooded methods of Red Coat, he couldn’t help but dismiss this idea.</p><p>After all, on this continent, how could ghost beasts that were almost exterminated still exist in groups and not be discovered by the Holy Divine Palace?</p><p>But now, the other party admitted it!</p><p>“Aren’t you afraid of the Holy Divine Palace?” He continued to ask.</p><p>“Yes, but it’s useless.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang shook her head and said, “The Xu Yue Grey Palace is located in the southern region. It’s a chaotic place. Even the order of the Holy Divine Palace is difficult to establish in that place.”</p><p>“Unless they are determined to clean up those miscellaneous but troublesome forces in the southern region, they won’t be able to catch the Xu Yue Grey Palace.”</p><p>“I see…” Xu Xiaoshou nodded.</p><p>No wonder the southern region was in chaos.</p><p>Most of the Holy Divine Palace’s forces were concentrated in the central and eastern regions, so they could not interfere for the time being?</p><p>“But if that’s the case, when they are free, your palace will be destroyed sooner or later, won’t it?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“Xu Yue Grey Palace!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, can you say something nice?”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang was angered again and said, “It’s impossible to be destroyed. Where there is oppression, there is resistance. There are many situations where ghost beasts have no choice but to huddle together to keep warm. It’s just that the Xu Yue Gray Palace is doing it a little bigger.”</p><p>Only when there is oppression will there be resistance… Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>Was this sentence used in such a way?</p><p>“You guys sound like you’re the ones who are righteous,” he could not help but mutter.</p><p>“Glared At, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“I’m not going to talk about this with you!”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang forcefully pulled back the topic that was sidetracked and said, “Before you sign the contract, I can’t reveal too much about ghost beasts to you.”</p><p>“But there’s one thing you can know for now.”</p><p>“What?” Xu Xiaoshou looked up curiously.</p><p>“The source of the ghost beasts!” Jiao Tangtang said.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was confused, “Aren’t ghost beasts born in the extradimensional space?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang nodded and continued, “But these ghost beasts born in the extradimensional space need to grow, just like Greedy the Cat Spirit in your hand.”</p><p>“These ghost beasts have a very long growth period. Only after signing a contract with a spiritual cultivator and continuously feeding spiritual objects can they shorten their growth period.”</p><p>“However, the growth period can be shortened, but the growth of spiritual intelligence is not that fast.”</p><p>“Just like an ordinary human being, no matter how talented they are, they can cultivate to become a Master or a Sovereign at a very young age.”</p><p>“But the way of thinking, the way of doing things… without the accumulation of time, it’s impossible for these things to grow.”</p><p>“Do you understand what I mean?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at her.</p><p>After a long while, he blinked.</p><p>Wasn’t this a very normal thing? Why would she need to explain it?</p><p>“I understand.”</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“You don’t understand.” Jiao Tangtang sighed. “Think about the ghost beasts you’ve encountered in the past.”</p><p>The ones I’ve encountered?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately thought of the grey mist figure.</p><p>However, was there anything special about them?</p><p>He looked at Jiao Tangtang across him in confusion.</p><p>However, the latter did not say anything. She only stared at him with a calm and indifferent gaze.</p><p>It was as if as long as he did not realize it, she was not prepared to say anything else.</p><p>The birth of a ghost beast and the growth of spiritual intelligence?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried hard to keep his thoughts up to Jiao Tangtang’s frequency.</p><p>After a long time, his thoughts came to a halt.</p><p>Doing things as a person?</p><p>Spiritual intelligence?</p><p>He felt a strange tug in his heart. He felt as if he had caught hold of some crucial information. However, if he really tried his best to think about it, he would not be able to explain it clearly.</p><p>“What exactly do you mean?” Xu Xiaoshou asked in surprise.</p><p>“That’s all I can tell you. You should think about what I said just now.” Jiao Tangtang obviously did not want to say anymore.</p><p>“How would I know what you said…” Xu Xiaoshou felt very uncomfortable.</p><p>He vaguely felt that something was wrong, but he didn’t know what it was.</p><p>He pulled Greedy the Cat Spirit down from his head.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked carefully, but he didn’t find anything wrong.</p><p>“Meow”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit stuck out his tongue and licked Xu Xiaoshou’s wrist.</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou was shocked awake.</p><p>“Wait, spiritual intelligence?”</p><p>If there was any difference between the grey mist figure and Greedy the Cat Spirit, it would be that the former would never stick out his tongue and lick himself like this little fat cat. Then…</p><p>“You just said that from the birth of a ghost beast to the maturity of its spiritual intelligence, it needs some time to develop similar to a human?” Xu Xiaoshou swallowed a mouthful of saliva.</p><p>“That’s right.” Jiao Tangtang nodded.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was horrified.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>The White Cave had only opened twice in total.</p><p>And the last time it opened, it was also the first time that the White Cave Small World was born.</p><p>At that time, the ghost beast that accompanied it was the grey mist figure.</p><p>But in just a few years, according to Jiao Tangtang’s theory, how could the grey mist figure form such an experienced way of doing things?</p><p>Without looking at its strength, just by looking at its battle awareness, as well as its various handling of people, things, etc…</p><p>It was completely an old monster that had seen through the mortal world and was well-versed in human relations!</p><p>And it only took a few years!</p><p>In just a few years, how could it be possible to cultivate and form such a thought, and how could it allow spiritual intelligence to grow to such a high level?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts were somewhat chaotic again.</p><p>He tried his best to recall what Jiao Tangtang had said just now. His memories flashed back and forth like a replay until the scene in his mind froze.</p><p>“This kind of ghost beast that was born from another extradimensional space…”</p><p>His sharp senses caught the information that Jiao Tangtang had inadvertently revealed. Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat. He raised his head and asked, “There are two kinds of ghost beasts?”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang’s red lips curled up. She only shook her head gently and did not speak.</p><p>“Tell me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was anxious.</p><p>This woman was she crazy?!</p><p>We have already reached this critical juncture, why are you still keeping us in suspense? Is this fun?</p><p>“I told you already before you become a ghost beast host body, there isn’t much information I can reveal to you,” Jiao Tangtang said.</p><p>“Okay, I won’t ask you for specific information. You just need to shake your head or nod your head,” Xu Xiaoshou said differently.</p><p>“Isn’t that answering?” Jiao Tangtang laughed. “I won’t do it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost threw Aje in front of him to beat this woman up.</p><p>He forced himself to calm down.</p><p>“Okay, I’ll do it another way.”</p><p>“Next, I’ll ask you a question. You don’t have to do anything. You can even say whatever you want with your expression and tone. You just need to cooperate with me and say one word, okay?”</p><p>Before the other party could say anything, Xu Xiaoshou raised Greedy the Cat Spirit in his hand up high. “If you don’t do it, I’ll strangle it to death!”</p><p>“Meow.”</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Just one word.” Xu Xiaoshou took the opportunity before the other party could get angry and quickly put down the little white cat. “It’s just a game. Do you want to play?”</p><p>“A game?” Jiao Tangtang asked angrily.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“What word?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded. “It’s similar to me asking you if you’re a woman and you reply yes.”</p><p>“You!” Jiao Tangtang almost raised her leg and rushed in front of the young man to whip him to death.</p><p>“It’s just a game. Don’t take it seriously.” Xu Xiaoshou shrank behind Aje.</p><p>“Ha, Xu Xiaoshou, you really know how to play… I am talking to you about ghost beasts, and you are talking about games?”</p><p>“Yes, only after we finish this game can we proceed to the next step.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou squeezed out a smile and said, “We’ll talk about signing a contract or something later. If the game is not completed, I won’t cooperate at all.”</p><p>“Okay!”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang was so angry that she was amused.</p><p>Since Xu Xiaoshou wants to go crazy, she would play with him.</p><p>“What question? Tell me.”</p><p>“The first question…” Xu Xiaoshou raised a finger and said, “Are you a woman?”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang’s face turned black.</p><p>“Game!” Xu Xiaoshou emphasized.</p><p>“Yes!” Jiao Tangtang answered unhappily.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the information column and heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>Very good, this woman with a bad temper was indeed a tigress.</p><p>“Second question…” he raised his second finger and said, “Is Xin Gugu a woman?”</p><p>“No…”</p><p>“A game!” Xu Xiaoshou raised his voice and interrupted, “You don’t need a brain. You only need to answer with one word and that’s ‘yes’!”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang gritted her teeth.</p><p>She felt that this kind of game… was so shameful!</p><p>Not only shameful but also retarded!</p><p>But… indeed, it was a disturbing move that Xu Xiaoshou knew how to play.</p><p>Okay, I’ll endure it.</p><p>“Yes!” She replied loudly.</p><p>“Deceived, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou exhaled lightly and flicked out the third finger. He said calmly, “There is only one type of ghost beast, Greedy the Cat Spirit, yes or no?”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang’s eyes narrowed and she muttered, “Xu Xiaoshou, don’t tell me you have some kind of mind-reading ability?”</p><p>“How did you know?” Xu Xiaoshou looked surprised.</p><p>Jiao Tangtang was stunned. “Really?”</p><p>“That’s right!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded. “I can still read that you are feeling very ashamed of this game. If it weren’t for these two big friends behind me, you would even want to come up and slap me to death. Am I reading it right?”</p><p>At this moment, she only felt pain in her liver, lungs, and all over her body.</p><p>Was this guy really acting crazy and acting dumb, or did he have some special ability?</p><p>Could it be that he thought that he could peek into her heart through her small actions and small details that were inadvertently exposed when she answered the questions?</p><p>Very good! If you, Xu Xiaoshou, have such an ability, then what’s the harm in exposing it to you?</p><p>“You read it wrong.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang was completely relaxed. She opened her red lips and said, “I don’t like to use my hands. All problems can be solved with my legs.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou subconsciously looked down.</p><p>It was a pair of full and round long legs that were exposed in the air because of the broken gray robe. The luster flowed and the elasticity was astonishing.</p><p>“Your legs had never gone through surgery before, yes or no?”</p><p>This Xu Xiaoshou… was sick!</p><p>She crossed her arms across her chest. She really didn’t care anymore. She lifted her chin as if she was ready to be interrogated.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>The Information bar didn’t move at all.</p><p>This is a real leg… Xu Xiaoshou nodded to himself.</p><p>“Continue.”</p><p>“There is only one type of ghost beast, Greedy the Cat Spirit. Yes or no?” Xu Xiaoshou brought up the previous question again.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang’s face had a seductive smile on it, and no one could see the ripples anymore.</p><p>“Deceived, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw it, but his expression did not change.</p><p>He spoke faster, and the questions and nonsense were thrown out at the same time.</p><p>“In the White Cave space, you only have one companion, and that is Xin Gugu. Yes or no?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Deceived, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Darn it, there was someone else?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face was expressionless. “The Xu Yue Gray Palace is a third-rate force, yes or no?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Deceived, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Darn it, how high-class was that force?</p><p>“The true strength of the Xu Yue Gray Palace is almost comparable to the Holy Divine Palace, yes or no?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“You’re very…” Xu Xiaoshou was halfway through his sentence when he suddenly felt that something was wrong.</p><p>Darn it! Where was the message?</p><p>Where was the “Deceived” message?</p><p>What the hell!</p><p>He almost stumbled, so he took a few steps forward and continued to ask, “You really want me to be your companion, yes or no?”</p><p>“Yes.” Jiao Tangtang didn’t see anything wrong.</p><p>Heh, you’re quite sincere?</p><p>“I’m very handsome, yes or no?” Xu Xiaoshou raised his chin and continued to ask.</p><p>“Pfft!” Jiao Tangtang couldn’t help but laugh. “Sorry, I couldn’t hold it in for a while… yes.”</p><p>There was actually no response from the message board?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment and confirmed, “I’m really very handsome?”</p><p>“Hehe, yes!”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang rolled her eyes at him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself that a woman’s heart was like a needle in a haystack. If it wasn’t for the message board, he would have been fooled by this woman.</p><p>So, I’m really handsome!</p><p>After he composed himself, Xu Xiaoshou asked happily, “There are only two types of ghost beasts, yes or no?”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang stopped smiling. “Xu Xiaoshou, after wasting so much time, are you finally going to reveal your true purpose?”</p><p>“Yes or no?” Xu Xiaoshou was unmoved.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>The information column remained motionless.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed in his heart.</p><p>Then, this was as he had expected.</p><p>The grey mist figure and Greedy the Cat Spirit were two different types of ghost beasts.</p><p>And Greedy the Cat Spirit was truly born from the extradimensional space.</p><p>Then, what kind of existence was the grey mist figure?</p><p>He really wanted to ask.</p><p>But according to Jiao Tangtang, if he did not sign the Ghost Beast Contract, she would definitely not reveal it.</p><p>Asking too much was obviously useless.</p><p>“Is it done?”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang put down her arms that were crossed in front of her chest, “I don’t have much time, I don’t have time to play such a boring, childish, and shameful retarded game with you!”</p><p>“Last question.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression finally became serious.</p><p>“If you have something to say, then say it!” Jiao Tangtang snorted and chose to accept.</p><p>“Phew!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath and then another deep breath. With a solemn expression, he said, “I, Xu Xiaoshou, am the most handsome man in the world. Yes or no?”</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>It was as if Jiao Tangtang had been poked at her laughing point. She was laughing so hard that she was shaking like a flower. Even Xu Xiaoshou was dazed for a moment.</p><p>Can you not make such a big commotion, you stupid gray robe.</p><p>“What are you laughing at?”</p><p>When the girl was almost done laughing, Xu Xiaoshou frowned and asked, “Be more serious. This is the last question. You have to answer it.”</p><p>“Serious?”</p><p>“Okay, I’ll be more serious.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang held her stomach and stopped smiling. She raised a finger and said seriously, “First of all, you’re not even a man…”</p><p>“Acknowledged, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>He looked at the information bar and felt his anger rise. He was furious…</p><p>Darn it! This trash system!</p><p>There must have been a bug, right?</p><p>At a time like this, what are you doing here?</p><p>Is this the time for you to show your presence?</p><p>Can you just die obediently?!</p><p>He was raging in his heart, but Xu Xiaoshou remained unmoved. He said seriously, “You’re wrong. The game is over. Let’s not talk about this anymore.”</p><p>“No, Let’s talk! Let’s talk!”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang was overjoyed. Looking at Xu Xiaoshou’s reaction, she understood everything. “I haven’t answered your question yet. Are you really not playing anymore?”</p><p>“I’m not playing!”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang looked at the dark-faced Xu Xiaoshou and felt that there was nothing funnier than this.</p><p>However, this fellow had been provoked to such an extent. Would it be difficult for them to work together in the future?</p><p>No, she had to give him a way out.</p><p>“Let’s continue, I’m not teasing you anymore, ask again.” Jiao Tangtang stopped smiling.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also felt ashamed and he wanted to turn the tables around and said, “Should I… forget it, I can’t ask anymore. Just tell me the answer!”</p><p>“Yes!” Jiao Tangtang immediately replied.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s smile had yet to bloom.</p><p>“Deceived, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Trash system! Go to hell!</p><p>“Aje, let’s go.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around and left.</p><p>“Ma Ma?”</p><p>Aje looked at Xu Xiaoshou whose face was as dark as ink. He was a little confused for a moment.</p><p>Game?</p><p>It had learned the human game, but it had not learned it thoroughly yet?</p><p>So human’s game always finished with an unhappy ending?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Looking at the young man who turned around and left, Jiao Tangtang could not laugh anymore.</p><p>Was he really hurt?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, come back here. We haven’t explained our matters clearly!” she shouted.</p><p>“There’s nothing to explain between us. What could there be between us? We are not cooperating, see you… never again.” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even turn his head.</p><p>“See you… never again?”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang was furious. “I’ve already played the game and you are telling me this?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
