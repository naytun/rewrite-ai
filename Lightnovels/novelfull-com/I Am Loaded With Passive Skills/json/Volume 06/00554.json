Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>“Dead?”</p><p>“They’re all going to die? !”</p><p>Looking at the sweat on his withered palm, Xu Xiaoshou curled up his Ji Sword in pain, completely absent-minded.</p><p>“Xin Gugu is dead?”</p><p>“And I. . . What am I doing?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s footsteps came to a halt, and his hands suddenly supported the soil on both sides.</p><p>He raised his head and realized that he had passed through the sea of blood barrier that Xin Gugu had summoned from the deep pit underground.</p><p>He was just one step away from breaking out of the ground.</p><p>“No, no, no…”</p><p>“Saint Servant, that’s the Saint Servant!”</p><p>“Xu Yue Grey Palace, that’s the Xu Yue Grey Palace!”</p><p>“This is a war between a bunch of big shots at the Cutting Path Stage. What can I do if I go?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grabbed his hand desperately, trying to calm himself down.</p><p>“Putting everything else aside, what about the other side, even if we completely forget about the Storyteller and the Ghost Beast?”</p><p>Like him, more than ten red-robed were watching the battle from the sidelines, waiting for an opportunity to make a move.</p><p>“There are all Red-robed, Night Guardian, Lan Ling, Yu Zhiwen, and the Heaven Sealing Array.”</p><p>“I’m just a little innate ant, what am I thinking?”</p><p>“Get out?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s red eyes were filled with a primitive desire to destroy. Xu Xiaoshou’s breathing became faster and faster.</p><p>“Hu!”</p><p>“Hu!”</p><p>“Hu…”</p><p>He grabbed a handful of soil and rubbed his face.</p><p>Even the wrinkles on his old face, the pain of his skin being crushed and embedded into the sand, were not felt at all. He allowed his face to bleed and heal.</p><p>“Buzz, Buzz, Buzz.”</p><p>Ji sword tried his best to suppress his screams.</p><p>At this moment, his fear was not due to Xu Xiaoshou’s huge force that was about to strangle him to death. Instead, it was due to the demon king’s crazy emotions.</p><p>What was wrong with this guy?</p><p>Was he having a seizure?</p><p>“Feared, passive points + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou panted heavily.</p><p>“I can’t go out, I can’t go out.”</p><p>“What can I do?”</p><p>“The most I can do is to release Aje, and then watch Aje get maimed, beaten to death, and then expose my identity.”</p><p>“Finally, I’ll be beaten to death by the Storyteller, who is both embarrassed and angry, as well as Red-robed!”</p><p>“What can I do?”</p><p>“I have a skill of ‘Passive Fist’ that can heavily injure myself and leave half of my body behind, begging others on the battlefield not to kill me?”</p><p>“What can I do…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered to himself and answered his own question, “I can’t do anything!”</p><p>“If I go out now, I’ll die!”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>Seeing that Caramel could swallow the ghost beast bead that knew the outcome without any scruples, he wholeheartedly fought for Xin Gugu.</p><p>“What about me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind went blank.</p><p>A thought suddenly appeared in his mind.</p><p>Hiding in the ground like this, even if he really survived in the end..</p><p>What was the purpose of living?</p><p>“For myself?”</p><p>“For selfishness?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clutched his heart, and a hint of confusion appeared in his bloodshot eyes.</p><p>The former him might really have lived only for himself.</p><p>No one could say that he could live for the world after being terminated by a disease and having a lifetime of experience.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t do it either.</p><p>Windcloud Competition, assassination in the rainy night, Tianxuan Gate of the inner yard, City Lord Mansion framing Zhang Taiying as a ghost beast..</p><p>Which time did Xu Xiaoshou not live for himself?</p><p>But along the way, he realized that he had changed.</p><p>Everyone would grow.</p><p>No one could really “only” live for themselves!</p><p>But!</p><p>When the black hole shattered Xin Gugu, blood rained down from the sky.</p><p>The scene that appeared before Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes was the first time the two of them had met.</p><p>At the entrance of the Plenty Gold Company, that guy was hiding behind Caramel.</p><p>He had forgotten whether he had spoken to him or not.</p><p>He had roughly spoken a few words. He was basically a passerby that no one would remember.</p><p>But why was this scene..</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held his head and lowered it to hide.</p><p>Even so, the scene in front of him was still playing.</p><p>After Red Dog’s subordinate fainted, the first thing he saw when he woke up was the person drooling on his bed.</p><p>The person who had been at the front line during the night attack on the Zhang Mansion.</p><p>The person who had turned into a ghost beast under the virtual image of Zhang Taiying of the city Lord Mansion..</p><p>“Xin Gugu, what is he living for?”</p><p>“Also for himself?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sneered.</p><p>He felt that this answer was too ridiculous.</p><p>A discerning person could tell at a glance that the bull’s head did not match the horse’s mouth.</p><p>His vision suddenly blurred, and he saw Xin Gugu holding the gold card when he bought the manor in Tiansang City. A hint of envy flashed in his eyes.</p><p>“If you can, leave a room…”</p><p>Bang.</p><p>In the underground pit, the mud and rocks in all directions suddenly exploded with a dull thud. Then, they were suppressed by an unknown pressure and were firmly embedded into the mud layer.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly had tears in his eyes.</p><p>He did not understand what Xin Gugu was living for and why he was risking his life for.</p><p>This kind of question..</p><p>Perhaps, even that fellow himself did not know!</p><p>But suddenly, there was a moment where he could sympathize with it.</p><p>“If it weren’t for those brutal ghost beasts, there wouldn’t be a Red-robed who loved genocide.”</p><p>“And if it weren’t for those brutal Red-robed, these ghost beasts who lived for unknown reasons wouldn’t have to fight for hatred.”</p><p>“If…”</p><p>There were no ifs!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts suddenly stopped.</p><p>Reality was so cruel.</p><p>If… It could never exist.</p><p>And those vicious cycles of karma were left all over the place!</p><p>The people of the world were not stupid.</p><p>Everyone knew that they had long been trapped in a chess game. The more they struggled, the tighter they would be bound by the outside world.</p><p>But if they did not struggle, they would die.</p><p>Under such actions, what was the point of living?</p><p>It was already good enough to be alive.</p><p>“That’s not right!”</p><p>“This kind of world is deformed, isn’t it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly understood what he longed for and what he was trying to pursue.</p><p>It was not an extremely complicated matter of living for anything. It was just a simple yet pure word:</p><p>“Freedom!”</p><p>Just like a sparrow in a cage yearning to come out of its cage, a fish in a pond trying to leap into the air, a tiger in a mountain wanting to come out of the forest..</p><p>Freedom, there was no reason.</p><p>But freedom was simple. Every step one wanted to take was a restriction.</p><p>How could one break out of a cage in a battle between trapped beasts?</p><p>When everything about fate was arranged properly, everyone was like a cannon soldier who had been given the rules to advance since birth. Freedom was easier said than done?</p><p>There was a thud.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou collapsed on the ground, allowing the soil above his head to bury him.</p><p>He understood that what he had been fighting, rejecting, and pursuing… was nothing more than freedom!</p><p>Night Guardian, Saint Servant, Ghost Beast..</p><p>Every big shot and power who had offered him an olive branch seemed to be saying, “You, Xu Xiaoshou, are the strongest, the one with the most potential. Join us!”</p><p>But?</p><p>“I can’t do anything!”</p><p>Xin Gugu, Caramel..</p><p>Under the pressure of the Storyteller, one by one, they seemed to be friends, but he could only watch them die before his eyes.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had witnessed everything… was powerless!</p><p>What was the use of having potential?</p><p>Everyone knew that he, Xu Xiaoshou, was out now.</p><p>Other than sending himself to his death, he could do nothing.</p><p>But, just because of this, was he going to choose to continue living?</p><p>“Live…”</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed at himself.</p><p>The soil around him was clearly supported by the spiritual source, opening up a spherical living space.</p><p>But at this moment, the soil and rocks were still falling in large pieces, as if a small earthquake had occurred.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that even the earth was laughing at him.</p><p>He lowered his head and looked at the Ji Sword that had been deformed by him. His hand loosened.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I forgot about you.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoji desperately whimpered, as if he wanted to make a sound, but the sword body trembled violently and could not speak at all.</p><p>“Feared, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Feared, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the information bar and could not help but laugh.</p><p>He knew that Xu Xiaoji was very afraid of him, but he did not expect this guy to be so afraid.</p><p>Was it necessary?</p><p>“Xiaoji…”</p><p>“I remember your name. It seems that I gave it to you, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he was watching a movie. The funny scene of this guy desperately calling his brother outside the City Lord Mansion suddenly appeared in front of him.</p><p>“Wu Wu, Wu Wu.”</p><p>Large chunks of soil fell down.</p><p>The ground trembled slightly, and fine lines were cracking.</p><p>“Feared, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Received plea, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Not speaking?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the Xin again. Plea?</p><p>He laughed bitterly, raised the Ji Sword, and stabbed it into the ground.</p><p>“Pa!”</p><p>However, the Ji Sword was like a bent straw, directly sticking to the ground.</p><p>“It softened?”</p><p>“Am I that scary?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment, as if he thought of something and said, “Don’t be afraid. I had a plan earlier, and you should have heard it. The storyteller and I have exactly the same thoughts.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoji’s incarnation had four swords. It was too similar to the Fourth Sword.</p><p>As long as the battle reached a critical moment, everyone would go all out. They would not borrow the strength of the Fourth Sword.</p><p>The Storyteller gave him the Fourth Sword. After the switch, no one would be able to detect it.</p><p>But..</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered to himself and sighed.</p><p>“But living like this is really meaningless.”</p><p>“At least you’ve followed me for so long. It’s good to think about the underhand.”</p><p>“Now…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked up at the tragic scene in the battlefield. “I really can’t do such a thing.”</p><p>“Am I right?”</p><p>“SOB, sob…”</p><p>“Feared, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Received plea, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Sick!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rolled his eyes and held the Ji sword again.</p><p>“Turn into a straw hat.”</p><p>“SOB SOB…”</p><p>It couldn’t be changed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoji was about to cry.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Why was it that in this small pit, it was as if the gravity was increased by hundreds of times.</p><p>I can’t even stand up, how can I turn you into a straw hat?</p><p>“Then forget it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tightened his grip on the Ji Sword and suddenly raised his eyes.</p><p>The image in front of him flashed, and it was as if the chaotic space and time had been restored. The soul that was muttering to himself had returned to his body.</p><p>..</p><p>“Second Brother, take the sword!”</p><p>In a split second, the Storyteller’s voice that had no scruples was finally heard from the battlefield.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>There was also the vicious sword that was flying through the air under the pursuit of many Red-robed’s gazes!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou swept away his confusion with a glance and broke out of the ground, holding onto the Fourth Sword in one go.</p><p>There was no spiritual barrier.</p><p>He had no other worries.</p><p>He grabbed onto it.</p><p>He really grabbed onto it!</p><p>The suppressed emotions that had been completely gathered in the area of the underground pit, when they saw the light of day again, were like a mountain flood breaking through a dam, suddenly bursting out.</p><p>“Freedom…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s body trembled as he took a deep breath of the dust that was filled with the remnants of the battle.</p><p>It was different from the darkness underground.</p><p>It was different from the cramped and narrow space.</p><p>The sky and flying were the simplest freedom that everyone yearned for.</p><p>The spying in the darkness had been going on for too long.</p><p>It was so long that Xu Xiaoshou had become numb to himself. He was single-mindedly focused on the so-called survival.</p><p>But he clearly knew.</p><p>That so-called cozying up to his thigh. If he really left the ancient book’s space, how would he be able to escape?</p><p>There was no other way!</p><p>The strategy of not thinking about the outcome was just out of fear of the unknown, and he chose to deceive himself.</p><p>If he could survive, he could survive.</p><p>If he couldn’t survive, that was how life should be!</p><p>Then he should be like the free Cheng Xingchu after the silence of the darkness, blooming with his own glory.</p><p>Sometimes, fate was about not compromising, it was about the unexpected turn of events that occurred during the resistance.</p><p>“Freedom…”</p><p>The moment he held the Fourth Sword, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly realized that everything was no longer important.</p><p>This sick world was not worth thinking about.</p><p>When everyone was fighting for the peak, if there was nothing he could do, then he would hold the Fourth Sword and stand at the peak!</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>The arena of qi that could last for an entire battle, swallow the mountains and rivers, how powerful it was, Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to say.</p><p>The black hole above the Lijian Grassland had already been repaired, and the space had been restored to its original state following the truce between the Storyteller and the Red Twin Dragon Pythons.</p><p>However, the instant Xu Xiaoshou’s aura exploded, the space within a radius of several kilometers collapsed again, and the Earth was destroyed again.</p><p>The black hole spread, and the path mechanism was in disorder.</p><p>A small space of an ancient book had already suffered too many injuries.</p><p>At this moment, it was as if it was about to completely collapse. The mountains and rivers changed color, and the sky turned dark.</p><p>“Freedom…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou let out a low groan. Devil vein wrapped around his body, and Fourth Sword slanted in the air.</p><p>“Fight! There’s no reason!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
