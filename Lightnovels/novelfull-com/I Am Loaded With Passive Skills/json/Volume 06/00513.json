He’s just a child!”</p><p>“Bully?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused. “Little Junior Sister, can you wake up? Your Senior Brother is standing up for you.”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>Mu Zixi hesitated.</p><p>He was right!</p><p>She was being chased for no reason. Wasn’t her dream to have such a Senior Brother to stand up for her?</p><p>But…</p><p>She watched as the Little Monk was completely defeated step by step from his words to his heart under the watchful eyes of Xu Xiaoshou. In the end, even the remaining treasures on his body were taken away.</p><p>If she didn’t make a sound to stop him, wouldn’t the monk lose his skin in the end?</p><p>“Isn’t this too much…”</p><p>The little girl muttered.</p><p>The Little Monk was too miserable.</p><p>Even though she was the victim, she couldn’t help but sympathize with him.</p><p>“Why don’t we just forget about it?”</p><p>“He’s already in this state…” Mu Zixi pointed at the Little Monk on the ground and said timidly.</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes.” Bu Le nodded his head with all his might.</p><p>At this time, when he looked at the female benefactor whom he thought was a devil, his eyes were filled with cordiality.</p><p>“This kind of state?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rolled his eyes. “It’s not like there are any missing limbs. He has two eyes and a nose, and he’s completely unharmed. You’re making it sound like I’ve done something inhuman.”</p><p>Everyone present was speechless.</p><p>This Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>Indeed, he didn’t do any actual harm.</p><p>But with your words and actions, didn’t you see that the Little Monk’s entire soul was riddled with holes?</p><p>“Empty Hell Magic Staff, Buddha Slaying Blade…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen muttered.</p><p>Her attention was not on these small details at all. After thinking for a while, she asked in surprise, “Are you a disciple of the Western Region Buddhist Sect?”</p><p>“UH… Yes.” Bu Le hesitated and turned his head to look.</p><p>He had long noticed this beautiful big sister.</p><p>But at that time, the two sides did not talk, and he could not speak, so he did not know the big sister’s… uh, the background of this female benefactor.</p><p>However, it seemed that Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t moved by his words.</p><p>On the other hand, this female benefactor…</p><p>Was she the only person present who knew his identity?</p><p>“You Yuan Buddha…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen muttered again and asked with a frown, “If Buddha was resentful, the prison should be filled up. The northern locust tree without tears will also be hurt… the master you mentioned is this ‘You Yuan Buddha’, right?”</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes.” Monk Bu Le nodded his head vigorously.</p><p>Great!</p><p>This time, he was saved!</p><p>Finally, someone knew the background of his master!</p><p>He said in surprise, “Do you know my Master?”</p><p>“I know him, but he can’t know me.” Yu Zhiwen smiled and said, “I’ve only heard of the legend of ‘You Yuan Buddha’.”</p><p>“Is that so…” the Little Monk’s eyes immediately dimmed.</p><p>That’s right.</p><p>His master had already left for so many years.</p><p>This female benefactor was so young, how could he really know her?</p><p>He was… daydreaming.</p><p>“What kind of riddles are you guys playing?” Xu Xiaoshou looked over curiously. “What are you talking about?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen smiled faintly. “Haven’t you heard of it? The legend of the Ten High Nobles of The Central Region.”</p><p>“Ten High Nobles?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>He had heard of this title before.</p><p>If he remembered correctly, the Eighth Sword Deity was also one of them?</p><p>“So, this has something to do with those… if Buddha was resentful you mentioned?” Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows.</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen said, “Perhaps the most widespread legend in the Eastern Region is the legend of the Eighth Sword Deity.”</p><p>“But back then, the competition for The Ten High Nobles of The Central Region was really bloody.”</p><p>“Just his master…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen pointed at the Little Monk and said, “During his master’s term of the Ten High Nobles were the highest in history. Almost all the experts in the five regions of the continent were sent out just to compete for the ten supreme thrones.”</p><p>“The poem I said was a small password given by the wandering poets who had done good deeds in the past. They arranged the thrones according to the rank of the Ten High Nobles.”</p><p>“Who were they?” Xu Xiaoshou was immediately interested and asked.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen gently let out a sigh of relief. There was a look of yearning in his eyes as she softly recited,</p><p>“Kui Leihan, Bazhun’an, mysterious and unfathomable heavens.”</p><p>“Gou Wuyue, the scent of a woman, kill the mortal world and defeat the ghosts.”</p><p>“If Buddha was resentful, the prison should be filled up. The northern locust tree without tears will also be hurt.”</p><p>“In the drunken moon, there is a lingering hatred, half love for the common people and half cold!”</p><p>She tilted her head and smiled. “It’s easy to remember, right?”</p><p>“This is indeed very easy to remember…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou unconsciously echoed and was slightly dazed.</p><p>In just a few short sentences, he not only heard a few familiar names.</p><p>In fact, he could even get a glimpse of the glory of the era when geniuses were born, as well as the clanging sounds of swords and sabers.</p><p>This poet’s recitation was way too good!</p><p>“Ten thrones, ten people?” he asked.</p><p>“Yes.” Yu Zhiwen nodded. “One sentence, one person.”</p><p>“Hiss.”</p><p>After being hit by this, Xu Xiaoshou finally understood the origins of this Little Monk.</p><p>You Yuan Buddha?</p><p>If a Buddha was resentful, the prison would be filled up?</p><p>He looked in disbelief at the Little Monk who had collapsed to the ground.</p><p>This fellow’s origins were so great?</p><p>The Eighth Sword Deity was also one of the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>In other words…</p><p>Wasn’t this Little Monk equivalent to the personal disciple of the Eighth Sword Deity?</p><p>“Darn…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was going crazy.</p><p>This time, he suddenly had the idea of returning the Empty Hell Magic Staff and the Buddha Slaying Blade.</p><p>It was easy to invite Buddha, but difficult to send Buddha away!</p><p>He had already pulled the sheep’s fur. What if they came to settle the score in the future?</p><p>Bu Le looked at the shock in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes. He could completely see how much this fellow respected his master.</p><p>His chubby face wrinkled, and his eyes narrowed into a slit with a smile.</p><p>“How is it? My master is very powerful, isn’t he?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at this fellow’s smug look as if he could even see the words in his heart.</p><p>Now that you know my master’s identity, you still dare to provoke me?</p><p>He immediately felt extremely displeased. “Little Fellow, your master is so powerful. Is this how you’re going to embarrass him?”</p><p>“The three precepts of Buddhism have all been broken, and you almost became a devil.”</p><p>“Aren’t you embarrassed?”</p><p>The corners of Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth twitched as he said hatefully, “If I were you, I would probably be so ashamed that I would just commit suicide on the spot.”</p><p>Bu Le’s smile froze.</p><p>For a moment, his face was flushed red. He was about to find a hole in the ground and bury himself in it.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>Mu Zixi called out once again. There was a hint of worry in her eyes.</p><p>Previously, she didn’t know that the Little Monk had such a huge background, so she could allow Xu Xiaoshou to teach this little fellow a lesson.</p><p>But now…</p><p>She was fine.</p><p>The other party had such a powerful background.</p><p>Her Senior Brother didn’t need to offend the other party just to stand up for her.</p><p>“It’s fine.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew what this girl was thinking.</p><p>He didn’t really care.</p><p>It could be seen that the Little Monk’s upbringing was actually not bad. He was a person who could distinguish right from wrong.</p><p>He had just spoken out and enlightened him, helping him to understand his own demonic barrier and even breaking through it.</p><p>This favor could not be said to be insignificant.</p><p>In the end, Bu Le had come to this point because he was too young and too willful. He had no ill intentions.</p><p>“The Ten High Nobles…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was instead attracted by the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>He came back to his senses and asked, “You said that the little password of these Ten High Nobles is ranked accordingly.”</p><p>“Then, who is the ‘Kui Leihan’ in the first sentence?”</p><p>“Can he be ranked ahead of the Eighth Sword Deity?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t believe it.</p><p>In the Eastern Region.</p><p>Even in the entire continent, the Eighth Sword Deity, who was rumored to be amazing, was only ranked second?</p><p>Then, what kind of person was the one who’s ranked first?</p><p>“Kui Leihan…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s eyes revealed a look of respect.</p><p>“Kui Leihan, Bazhun’an, mysterious and unfathomable heavens!”</p><p>“This senior is not only ranked above the Eighth Sword Deity.”</p><p>“With him around, even the current Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace can only be ranked third…”</p><p>Only then did Xu Xiaoshou react.</p><p>Indeed.</p><p>This awesome person had suppressed the two most powerful people he knew!</p><p>One was the Way of the Sword.</p><p>The other was the Divine Secret.</p><p>They were both extremely awesome people.</p><p>“So, who is he?” Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but ask again.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen calmed himself down and slowly said, “Kui Leihan’s real name is Cao Yihan. He is an architect. The reason why he is ranked first among the Ten High Nobles…”</p><p>1</p><p>After a pause, Yu Zhiwen suddenly frowned.</p><p>“Actually, the ranking of the Ten High Nobles shouldn’t be like this. Many people have no interest in fighting until the end.”</p><p>“Just like Ai Cangsheng who’s at the bottom and the empty hatred at the end.”</p><p>“One is one of the three emperors of the current Holy Divine Palace, and the other has mastered the time attribute.”</p><p>“If they were to fight, even the Eighth Sword Deity might not be his match.”</p><p>“Time?” Xu Xiaoshou was shocked beyond belief.</p><p>He had heard of the space attribute.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian had it.</p><p>But time…</p><p>The only person he had seen who could use a little bit of the time-related order was probably the swordsman with nine swords of the three swordsmen, right?</p><p>And that was just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>So, there was really someone in this world who had mastered the time attribute?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>This talent…</p><p>As expected, comparing people would only anger people to death!</p><p>“So?” He continued to ask, “So, why is Kui Leihan ranked first?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen changed the topic and said, “The reason why Kui Leihan is number one is that he used an unparalleled power during the fight for the Ten High Nobles.”</p><p>“It’s a product that transcends eras. It’s a power that has never appeared before!”</p><p>“What power?”</p><p>This time, not only was Xu Xiaoshou attracted.</p><p>Even Mu Zixi, the Little Monk, Xu Xiaoji who was curled up in a corner, and Aje who liked to learn all stretched out their necks and listened.</p><p>“Psychokinesis!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen said calmly, “It was just psychokinesis at the beginning. Later on, after the battle and comprehension, Kui Leihan completely transformed it into a new form of power — penetrating divine senses!”</p><p>“Psychokinesis?”</p><p>“Penetrating divine senses?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded.</p><p>He felt his brain buzzing as if something was connected to him.</p><p>“The psychokinesis you mentioned, could it be…”</p><p>“What is it?” Yu Zhiwen turned his head.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou exhaled and thought of his ten sword fingers. He thought of the kind of “psychokinesis” that he had comprehended in Tianxuan Gate.</p><p>Could it be… the same kind?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen didn’t care and continued to explain, “Psychokinesis is a special power that combines the shape, energy, and spirit of the body to transform the mind into substance.”</p><p>“This kind of power can only be considered average.”</p><p>“Although in terms of conceptual output, it has indeed surpassed all previous thoughts.”</p><p>“But in terms of actual strength, when encountering a spiritual technique that truly possesses the ability to destroy the world, it can only be described as ‘average’.”</p><p>“But ‘penetrating spiritual sense’ is different.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen sighed in surprise and continued, “The penetrating spiritual sense is based on the original psychokinesis, adding the spiritual cultivator’s thoughts and completely communicating with the Way of the Heavens.”</p><p>“Moreover, it can also intercept in a short time… no, it should be said to completely control part of the Way of the Heavens’ power!”</p><p>“Control…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen said so much that she couldn’t believe it herself, but she continued.</p><p>“Isn’t the power of controlling the Way of the Heavens the power of a God?”</p><p>“Who can believe this?”</p><p>“No one!” she answered herself.</p><p>“So, under the circumstances where everyone didn’t believe it, Kui Leihan used his thunder attribute and combined his psychokinesis to communicate with the Way of the Heavens. Then, he turned into the original body of the first generation of the Penetrating Divine Senses — God Punishment Tribulation!”</p><p>“God Punishment Tribulation…”</p><p>She shook her head with admiration in her eyes. “The appearance of the first generation of Penetrating Divine Senses had subverted the previous power system. It successfully allowed Kui Leihan to grasp the Power of the Higher Void with a Cutting Path’s ability.”</p><p>“He even stole a trace of divine power above that of the Holy Emperor!”</p><p>“I heard that even a Demi-Saint would avoid him!”</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>Everyone gasped.</p><p>Even the Monk Bu Le was shocked.</p><p>His master was indeed a You Yuan Buddha of the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>However, he left early, and he rarely revealed the legends of his peak.</p><p>As a result, Bu Le didn’t know about such secrets or anything about it.</p><p>In the past, he only knew that his master was very powerful, but he didn’t know how powerful his master was.</p><p>But now, he understood.</p><p>To be able to be ranked on the same Ten High Nobles as a person who could threaten a Demi-Saint at the Cutting Path realm, his master was darn… er, he was very powerful!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thinking was completely different from Bu Le’s.</p><p>What shocked him was his ‘psychokinesis’.</p><p>According to Yu Zhiwen, the power that he had comprehended in Tianxuan Gate was indeed the initial form of the ‘Penetrating Divine Senses’.</p><p>But!</p><p>Didn’t he comprehend it from the 10 Sections of the Finger Sword?</p><p>Didn’t the Eighth Sword Deity comprehend it himself?</p><p>How was it related to the Kui Leihan?</p><p>Among them…</p><p>“The psychokinesis you mentioned, ah no, Penetrating Divine Senses and God Punishment Tribulation? Was it really something that Kui Leihan comprehended on his own? It wasn’t plagiarized?” Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>“Plagiarized?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was immediately amused.</p><p>“As the founder of the first generation of the Penetrating Divine Senses, how can he be described as plagiarizing?”</p><p>“Who can he plagiarize?”</p><p>“Who can provide him with the idea of plagiarism?”</p><p>“To put it in reverse, all the second generation of the Penetrating Divine Senses that appeared in the world today are the true crystallization of Kui Leihan’s ideas plagiarism.”</p><p>“However, in terms of power, there are very few who can reach the level of the first-generation Penetrating Divine Senses.”</p><p>As she spoke, her gaze suddenly stopped on Bu Le. She smiled and said, “Little Monk, if I’m not mistaken, the Golden Buddhist light that bloomed on your body just now should be the ‘Penetrating Divine Senses’, right?”</p><p>“Uh…” Bu Le’s face turned red.</p><p>Plagiarism…</p><p>He couldn’t accept this term.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen turned her head to look at Xu Xiaoshou. “The Buddhist sect’s ‘Power of Will’ is the second generation of Penetrating Divine Senses. It was developed by You Yuan Buddha according to the first generation’s Penetrating Divine Senses, God Punishment Tribulation, and combined with Buddhism.”</p><p>“It belongs to one of the very few existences in this world that can contend with the first generation’s Penetrating Divine Senses.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly understood.</p><p>No wonder.</p><p>No wonder when the virtual image behind the Little Monk appeared just now, the Buddhist light around his body burst out.</p><p>He couldn’t even stabilize his Master Physique with the Recoil and was sent flying.</p><p>“Second generation’s Penetrating Divine Senses?”</p><p>He muttered and suddenly asked, “In that second generation’s Penetrating Divine Senses, other than the Power of Will of the Western Region’s Buddhist Sect, what else is famous?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen smiled and said, “You are a swordsman. You should ask yourself this question.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>He immediately reacted and exclaimed.</p><p>“Sword cognition?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen nodded with a smile.</p><p>“Legend has it that the Eighth Sword Deity and Kui Leihan are best friends.”</p><p>“This sword cognition was developed by him based on Kui Leihan’s God Punishment Tribulation and after the two of them discussed it together. It is the highest level of the second-generation’s Penetrating Divine Senses.”</p><p>“Kui Leihan used the path of a spiritual cultivator to enter the Penetrating Divine Senses.”</p><p>“The Eighth Sword Deity is different. He is both a spiritual cultivator and an ancient swordsman.”</p><p>“He did not use the so-called spiritual cultivator to enter the path when he tried to surpass the thoughts of his predecessors. Instead, he used the most direct psychokinesis to condense it.”</p><p>“Then, he used the cultivation method of the ancient swordsman to completely integrate the system of sword cognition.”</p><p>“It’s different from other Penetrating Divine Senses.”</p><p>“In terms of pure Penetrating Divine Senses, even Kui Leihan himself termed the sword cognition as number one.”</p><p>“Moreover, unlike the second-generation’s Penetrating Divine Senses of other spiritual cultivators, this sword cognition, which belongs to the Way of the Sword, is second to the number one.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen raised a finger. “It’s the only one!”</p><p>“I see…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally understood what he had comprehended just now.</p><p>It turned out that after going round and round, this was the origin of his psychokinesis.</p><p>He suddenly thought of something.</p><p>Since sword cognition was the only one.</p><p>Didn’t that mean that its cultivation method was also the only one?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils suddenly constricted as he felt that he had discovered a blind spot.</p><p>“How do you cultivate sword cognition?”</p><p>When this ridiculous question was asked, not only the Little Monk, but even Mu Zixi was stunned.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, are you stupid? If you ask someone else how to cultivate sword cognition, wouldn’t you…”</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>She was stunned when she heard that.</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>How did Xu Xiaoshou know how to cultivate sword cognition?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen glanced at Xu Xiaoshou with a strange expression.</p><p>She was still immersed in the magnificence of the past era and could not extricate herself. She did not think of this at the moment and only said softly,</p><p>“Sword cognition had a cultivation method that was passed down, but unfortunately, I don’t know it.”</p><p>“Legend has it that after the Eighth Sword Deity comprehended sword cognition, he combined all the essence of ancient swordsman and wrote a book called the ‘Sword Observation Manual’.”</p><p>“If you want to cultivate this sword cognition, you can only find the lost Sword Observation Manual.”</p><p>“Why are you asking about this… hmm?”</p><p>She suddenly stopped talking.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou… also knew sword cognition!</p><p>“Your sword cognition…”</p><p>Rub, rub, rub.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face was shocked, and he stepped back one.</p><p>He couldn’t hear anything.</p><p>When the three words “Sword Observation Manual” appeared, his mind buzzed once again as he completely understood everything.</p><p>“The scruffy-looking man!”</p><p>“That scruffy-looking man was the one who gave him the Sword Observation Manual…”</p><p>“So!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared in disbelief.</p><p>So he had actually seen the Eighth Sword Deity?</p><p>That person was the Eighth Sword Deity?!</p><p>“No, no, no!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou instantly overturned his own reasoning.</p><p>If the Eight Sword Deity was that scruffy-looking man.</p><p>Where should the Saint Servant Masked Man, whom he had speculated, be placed?</p><p>It was impossible, that these two guys… a ridiculous speculation came up…</p><p>“They’re the same person?”</p><p>“Saint Servant was created by the Eighth Sword Deity?”</p><p>“Oh my God…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt like his brain had turned into mush!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“Called, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Called, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>The voices in his ears became louder and louder. Xu Xiaoshou finally came back to his senses. He looked at Yu Zhiwen and Mu Zixi, who was looking at him worriedly.</p><p>“I’m fine.”</p><p>He hurriedly waved his hand.</p><p>“I know you’re fine.” Yu Zhiwen wasn’t worried about that. “What did you think of…”</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook her head. He couldn’t even say another word.</p><p>“The Eighth Sword Deity?”</p><p>“No,” Xu Xiaoshou denied.</p><p>“Oh…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen narrowed her star eyes. She was also shocked by her own speculation, but she immediately refuted it.</p><p>“It can’t be the Eighth Sword Deity.”</p><p>“The Sword Observation Manual has long been lost, but there is still a cultivation method of sword cognition left behind. Although it’s incomplete, there are still two places that can be found.”</p><p>“Perhaps, what you obtained is an incomplete cultivation method of sword cognition from those two places.”</p><p>Lost…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself, how could it be lost.</p><p>At that time, that scruffy-looking man had killed Red Coat with two fingers, and an ancient book had been slapped in front of him.</p><p>That manual was not lost.</p><p>This was the original copy of the Sword Observation Manual!</p><p>“What place?”</p><p>He did not show it, but instead followed the conversation and asked.</p><p>“The Fringe Moon Immortal City and the Burial Sword Tomb,” Yu Zhiwen said.</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou instantly came back to his senses.</p><p>The Burial Sword Tomb?</p><p>He remembered that the three swordsmen seemed to have come from this place, right?</p><p>That’s right.</p><p>They also knew sword cognition…</p><p>“Tell me about it?” Xu Xiaoshou raised his head and ended his thoughts.</p><p>“The Fringe Moon Immortal City was actually established in the last few decades, but it has been in the limelight. It’s about to seize the title of the number one swordsman faction in the Eastern Region.”</p><p>“Because its founder is said to be the in-name disciple of the Eighth Sword Deity.”</p><p>“If the Sword Observation Manual is lost, the place that it is most likely to appear would be the Fringe Moon Immortal City.”</p><p>“As for the Burial Sword Tomb…”</p><p>“The Burial Sword Tomb is a place that has been passed down since ancient times. It was originally a mountain and was named Eastern Mountain.”</p><p>“But because it gathered the fate of all the swords in the world, it collapsed and fell, so it was also called the Burial Sword Tomb.”</p><p>“Speaking of the Burial Sword Tomb…”</p><p>As Yu Zhiwen spoke, she paused for a moment, and a hint of a smile appeared on her face.</p><p>“There’s a very interesting legend in the Burial Sword Tomb.”</p><p>“What legend?” Xu Xiaoshou looked over.</p><p>“Actually, it’s not a legend. It’s a fact.”</p><p>The smile on Yu Zhiwen’s face grew even wider.</p><p>“The leader of every generation in the Burial Sword Tomb is known as the ‘Sword Bearer’. And this generation’s Sword Bearer, Wen Ting, is a good friend whom the Eighth Sword Deity made before he thrived and traveled the world together.”</p><p>“He’s very strong.”</p><p>“But no one knows how strong he is.”</p><p>“Because no matter how strong he is, as long as he is a swordsman, no one can compete with him under the light of the Eighth Sword Deity.”</p><p>“But in the end, the world still saw his light…”</p><p>“It was after the fall of the Eighth Sword Deity!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen kept them guessing.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Without a doubt, everyone’s interest was piqued.</p><p>“Because…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen covered her mouth with her hand, and there was an uncontrollable smile on her face.</p><p>She seemed to be imitating the tone of the Storyteller at that time, and there was a hint of mischievousness and ridicule in her tone.</p><p>“Because it was only after the fall of the Eighth Sword Deity that the people of the world discovered…”</p><p>“Ah! So the person who killed all over the five regions with the Eighth Sword Deity was not only at the top of the famous sword rankings — the Sword Bearer of Yuelian was also one of the Seven Sword Deities?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
