It seemed that he had followed Lu Ke’s famed sword, the Green Scale Ridge.</p><p>But it was different!</p><p>At the very least, he had dispelled his disappearing state that time.</p><p>Could this masked man really sense it just by feeling it?</p><p>“Is it an illusion?”The masked man on the ground muttered. After glancing at the two people beside him who had disbelief on their faces, he added.</p><p>Then, he set his gaze in the direction of the explosion.</p><p>“Old Seven, the space has been dispelled. It’s time to go out.”</p><p>“Oh ok.”</p><p>The storyteller nodded his head, not caring much.</p><p>..</p><p>Releasing the space?</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou heard this, he was immediately delighted.</p><p>As expected!</p><p>His deduction just now was not wrong.</p><p>This perverted man in the red dress was really an extremely cautious character.</p><p>Even though he met his Saint Servant’s chief here, he was still worried and sealed off the entire space.</p><p>That meant that if he had really taken a step to escape from this place, he would have only brought about his own destruction!</p><p>“Snap.”</p><p>After hearing the storyteller snap his fingers, the void seemed to shake.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart became active.</p><p>Just the short process of hiding and eavesdropping had almost depleted his elixirs.</p><p>The amount of spiritual source consumed by the vanishing technique was too large.</p><p>If the storyteller didn’t undo the spatial banishment technique, Xu Xiaoshou might really self-destruct.</p><p>In this situation, there was only one path left.</p><p>“One step towards…”</p><p>He shouted in his heart.</p><p>But when his spirit was about to reach its peak, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly restrained his impulse.</p><p>Because at this time, he inadvertently glanced at the information bar.</p><p>Information Bar..</p><p>“Watched, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Framed, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>“Watched?”?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s first reaction was why someone could still watch him after he disappeared.</p><p>But in the next second, he was attracted by the second message.</p><p>“Framed…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could barely suppress the steps he was about to take.</p><p>He was dumbfounded.</p><p>Who else could it be besides the Saint Servant trio?</p><p>In that case, wasn’t the meaning of framing him the same as saying..</p><p>“Ta-ta-ta.”</p><p>He raised his head.</p><p>The three people above him walked past him without any strange emotions.</p><p>However, with this tacit cooperation, Xu Xiaoshou used “Perception”to examine them closely.</p><p>The corners of the storyteller’s mouth curled up slightly..</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s hand, which was as usual, lightly slung over the small axe at his waist..</p><p>The masked man’s slightly curled ring finger and little finger..</p><p>To put it another way, he extended his sword finger!</p><p>“F * ck, these three people, are they acting on me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s little heart almost jumped out of his throat.</p><p>He used his “Perception”to probe into the distance.</p><p>The scene before his eyes was all familiar with the landscape of White Cave.</p><p>Even the slightest movement of the wind and grass, as well as the dancing of gravel, was so realistic.</p><p>But at this moment, Xu Xiaoshou was extremely certain.</p><p>He was still in the space of the ancient book!</p><p>Take the easy way out.</p><p>The sky would collapse!</p><p>“Ta.”</p><p>The three people above walked directly above Xu Xiaoshou. The masked man stopped in his tracks and sighed in disappointment, “It didn’t take the bait, this person.”</p><p>“Ha, it’s been a long time since I’ve seen such an exquisite concealment technique that could deceive even the Cutting Path.”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu smiled and took out his small axe. “Who could it be?”</p><p>Only the storyteller’s expression was completely stiff.</p><p>If it was a day ago, he would even dare to say that the person hiding here had a cultivation level of at least Higher Void. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to deceive his brother.</p><p>But now.</p><p>In the White Cave.</p><p>There was such a young man who had a concealment technique that even he himself could not see through.</p><p>“Wen Ming…”</p><p>“Hmm?”The masked man and Cen Qiaofu turned their heads at the same time.</p><p>“Wen Ming.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”Cen Qiaofu was stunned and could not say the second half of the sentence.</p><p>“Wen Ming!”</p><p>The storyteller’s tone became heavier.</p><p>This time, even the masked man understood what he meant.</p><p>“You mean, you fought with him and he has a concealment technique that even you can’t see through?”</p><p>“Gulp.”</p><p>The storyteller swallowed his saliva.</p><p>He simply couldn’t imagine how gutsy Little Wen Ming was that he would dare to come here.</p><p>But now..</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>The storyteller nodded his head lightly, and Cen Qiaofu’s entire face changed color.</p><p>Could that innate cultivation level Wen Ming have such a concealment technique?</p><p>“A day apart, it’s like three years. The ancient advice from ancestors truly do not lie to us.”</p><p>The masked man slowly reached out his hand and clapped his palm. His line of sight moved around, but he could not see where Wen Ming was at all.</p><p>“Come out, don’t hide anymore.”</p><p>He was silent for a moment before saying, “You should know, I can’t hurt you, based on… various reasons.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clenched his fists in pain.</p><p>I know that because of Elder Sang, you might not hurt me.</p><p>But that pervert..</p><p>And what if..</p><p>And so what if you don’t hurt me? Why do you want to catch me..</p><p>All of this is even more heartbreaking than hurting me!</p><p>“I, Xu Xiaoshou, will not appear in front of the three of you even if I die,”Xu Xiaoshou swore secretly.</p><p>Shua.</p><p>At this moment, the three people above turned around in unison and looked at the ground at the same time.</p><p>Judging from the magnification of their pupils, these three people were not staring at the ground.</p><p>But, where was he?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s body tensed up.</p><p>In the next second, he felt a pressure coming from deep underground.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind froze.</p><p>“Pressure…”</p><p>“Vanishing technique, why does it feel like pressure?”</p><p>His head moved with difficulty, and Xu Xiaoshou felt as if some mud was being pressed into his ear canal.</p><p>This real feeling made him feel as if he had been struck by lightning.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Checking his energy reserve.</p><p>Empty.</p><p>“F * ck!”</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou’s mind was flabbergasted and his whole body almost split open on the spot.</p><p>Just because he forgot to eat another handful of elixirs in such a short span of time..</p><p>His energy reserve bottomed out.</p><p>He couldn’t maintain the vanishing technique anymore?</p><p>“Little, Wen, Ming –”</p><p>The corner of the storyteller’s lips almost reached the edge of his earlobe, and his smile became more and more impudent and perverted as he called out each word.</p><p>“Hiss.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou kept quiet out of fear, and shuddered on the spot.</p><p>“Called, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>“Startled, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>“Watched, passive points + 4.”</p><p>“F * ck…”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou had mixed feelings. He simply did not know what expression to use to express the chaotic emotions in his heart.</p><p>A smile appeared in the masked man’s turbid eyes.</p><p>He raised his two fingers.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The earth was directly torn apart by the intangible sword will, and a huge gully that was ten feet wide split open on the spot.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that his naked body was exposed under three burning gazes.</p><p>One was the perverted man’s.</p><p>One was the old man’s.</p><p>The last one was a cripple’s..</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>The pores all over his body exploded. Xu Xiaoshou suddenly discovered a method that could allow him to instantly reach high tide even without taking drugs.</p><p>He subconsciously tightened his clothes.</p><p>The clothes were still there.</p><p>But this layer of covering cloth on the ground had completely disappeared under the two fingers of the masked man!</p><p>“Ha, Ha Ha…”</p><p>The atmosphere froze.</p><p>A little..</p><p>No.</p><p>To Xu Xiaoshou, it was extremely awkward.</p><p>“You are Wen Ming?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu looked as if he was sizing up a monster. He used a first-time look to carefully observe the person underground.</p><p>It was as if he wanted to use his gaze to see through every single pore on the young man’s body.</p><p>“Long time no see.”</p><p>A smile appeared in the masked man’s turbid eyes as he slowly released his ring and Pinky Fingers. “If I remember correctly, this is our third… no, our fourth meeting?”</p><p>Fourth?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind was suddenly jolted awake.</p><p>Things had come to this.</p><p>Since he had been exposed, he would no longer worry about everything that he had been worried about before he was exposed.</p><p>Moreover..</p><p>“Fourth?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts began to spin crazily.</p><p>The first time he met the masked man was by the Greater Goose Lake in Tiansang Spirit Palace. At that time, he had killed Feng Kong and then stabbed the masked man’s heart with Hidden Bitter.</p><p>Yes, a little bit.</p><p>The second time they met was at the back mountain. At a turn, he sent Hidden Bitter into the masked man’s chest.</p><p>The third time they met..</p><p>He couldn’t remember!</p><p>“I… lost my memory?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that ever since the passive skill “Perception”was activated, his memory was definitely the best in the world.</p><p>But now…</p><p>He didn’t know whether it was because he was nervous or something else, but he couldn’t remember the third time he met the masked man?</p><p>Could the masked man have remembered wrongly?</p><p>It wasn’t likely.</p><p>In other words, at a certain moment that he had not noticed, the masked man had met him a third time.</p><p>Moreover, from what the other party had said, “To you”…</p><p>He himself also knew about the existence of the masked man!</p><p>“It’s more than that.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately shrugged his shoulders when he thought of this. He was a little stiff, but also a little relieved. He said, “It should be the fifth time?”</p><p>The masked man raised his eyebrows. “If you say fifth, then it should be fifth!”</p><p>It was not the fifth time!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately understood that the masked man did not intend to haggle with him on this small issue.</p><p>And judging from the other party’s micro expression, he did not agree with his words at all.</p><p>That was to say, it was only four times.</p><p>He had indeed met the masked man for the third time.</p><p>Which time?</p><p>Two scenes flashed through Xu Xiaoshou’s mind.</p><p>One was the sculpting uncle he had met in the spiritual library division before bidding farewell to Elder Sang and leaving the Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>The other time was the Three Incenses’killer, Red Dog, and the scruffy-looking man.</p><p>Which one?</p><p>“Five times!”He said firmly again.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>The masked man nodded with a smile.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was about to break down.</p><p>Not five times!</p><p>In other words, only one of the two times was the real masked man?</p><p>His previous speculation was that the scruffy-looking man was the chief of the Saint Servant.</p><p>However, the relationship between the chief of the Saint Servant and Elder Sang had also drawn out the sculpted man in the spiritual library division who looked very similar to the scruffy-looking man.</p><p>If they had only met four times.</p><p>These two people would not be the same person.</p><p>So, which one was the chief of the Saint Servant?</p><p>No, this was not important at all!</p><p>What was important was..</p><p>Which one was the eighth sword deity? !</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seriously suspected that the one who gave him the “Sword Observation Manual” was the true chief of the Saint Servant, and also the true eighth sword deity.</p><p>But if he was…</p><p>The person from the spiritual library division could appear in the spiritual library division, which showed his relationship with Elder Sang, and he looked so much like the scruffy-looking man, and they were not the same person..</p><p>How could he explain it?</p><p>If the scruffy-looking man was not the masked man, he would not be the eighth sword deity.</p><p>His “Sword Observation Manual”..</p><p>And why would the Fourth sword attack a person he had never met so crazily..</p><p>“I’m going to explode!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s temples bulged. He was going to be dizzy from his own thoughts.</p><p>As he thought about it, his gaze suddenly fixed on the masked man. Xu Xiaoshou felt that the big stones in his heart had shattered.</p><p>How stupid!</p><p>The person was right in front of him. Why not just ask him directly?</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou threw away all his thoughts and went straight to the point.</p><p>The masked man did not seem to be surprised at why the other party would ask such a devious question. He only replied, “Saint servant, Chief.”</p><p>“So your surname is Saint Servant and your name is Chief?”Xu Xiaoshou clenched his fists and was a little nervous.</p><p>This time, even the two people on the side could hear the hidden meaning of Xu Xiaoshou’s words.</p><p>But a strange situation appeared.</p><p>The storyteller and Cen Qiaofu actually took half a step back and looked at the masked man with a very expectant gaze.</p><p>The scene was silent for a few seconds.</p><p>“Sizzle.”</p><p>The masked man chuckled and ignored the burning gazes of the two people on the side. He only stared at Xu Xiaoshou and said, “Are you sure you want to ask my name?”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost blurted out, “I’m sure.”.</p><p>But he suddenly could not say it.</p><p>Yes!</p><p>Was it important?</p><p>Was it important who the chief of the Saint Servant was?</p><p>He, who did not know everything, could still stay away from the center of the vortex of the storm.</p><p>Now that he knew everything, he felt lost and helpless, as well as the irresistible force of external forces.</p><p>If he knew a little more, even if it was just a little..</p><p>Would it be the last straw that broke the camel’s back?</p><p>In this world, there were some causes and effects, some mysteries, some indescribable things, and some people who were secretive, they all had their reasons.</p><p>Would knowing too much really be beneficial to him?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou asked himself.</p><p>“Name…”</p><p>He didn’t know what he was expecting.</p><p>It was the title that was deified by the world in the past.</p><p>Or perhaps, the other party would blurt out a title that he had never heard of in his entire life?</p><p>He didn’t know.</p><p>But just like the moment when he was thrown on a coin, when he was forced to make a decision, the gears of fate had already closed.</p><p>Did he know?</p><p>Did he know..</p><p>Was it important?</p><p>It was important!</p><p>However, because it was too important, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he could not shoulder it.</p><p>“Wait a moment.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held his head with one hand and reached out with the other to stop the other party from speaking. “Allow me to think…”</p><p>“You’re afraid.”</p><p>The masked man was still full of smiles. “As an ancient swordsman, bravely advancing forward is the correct path that the world should pursue. Now, a title is pressing down on you.”</p><p>“No, you are wrong.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou denied it.</p><p>“Ancient swordsman who advanced courageously, without exception, are all defeated, including…”</p><p>He paused for a moment and did not continue. He continued, “What the world thinks is not necessarily accurate.”</p><p>“Moreover, I am not just an ancient swordsman.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou loosened his fists as he spoke, and his tense muscles also relaxed.</p><p>“I have no interest in your title or what Saint Servant wants to do.”</p><p>“Even if I was accidentally dragged into it earlier, it was only because of Elder Sang… who is the second-in-command of the Saint Servant. He dragged me into it without my knowledge.”</p><p>“Now!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou became more and more agitated as he spoke, but his aura weakened after a pause.</p><p>“I only have one small request…”</p><p>“No.”The masked man shook his head.</p><p>“It is to let me go. I’m not worthy. I can’t participate in your plan… Ah?”Xu Xiaoshou bowed halfway before he seemed to hear the masked man’s voice.</p><p>“Not.”</p><p>The loud words directly pressed down on the young man deep underground until he could not straighten his back.</p><p>The scene was once again silent.</p><p>All was silent, leaving only the lonely sound of the world being shattered. It was as if the Holy Dawn that could not be broken or established was about to arrive.</p><p>The masked man raised his head and looked at the world of the White Cave that was on the verge of death. He said, “The world is so big, but you have come to my side time and time again and stood by my side. Isn’t this fate?”</p><p>“Fate is fated. Where else do you want to go?”</p><p>..</p><p>PS: April 1st. It’s the first anniversary of the Xiaoshou. Let’s celebrate</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
