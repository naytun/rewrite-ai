He no longer tried to force her. Instead, he said, “So, according to what you said, you guys are only here to treat your injuries. There’s nothing else, right?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rao Yinyin looked up. “What is it?”</p><p>“That’s great.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clapped his hands in satisfaction. “You guys can rest. What I want is none of your business.”</p><p>“What you want…”</p><p>Rao Yinyin’s eyes narrowed. She finally could not hide it anymore. She asked, “What do you want?”</p><p>“That’s none of your business.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lazily placed his hands on the back of his head. “Anyway, I don’t need your help. You guys can just leave after you rest. It’s fine as long as you don’t drag us down.”</p><p>“You!”</p><p>“Receiving angry looks, passive value, + 1.”</p><p>Rao Yinyin paused for a moment, but she still couldn’t help but make it clear. “Xu Xiaoshou, you also want the ‘Path Pattern Initial Stone’?”</p><p>“Hehe.”</p><p>“Also?”</p><p>“Don’t you all want to rest?” Xu Xiaoshou pointed at the others.</p><p>This time, the people in groups of three or five nearby were also attracted by the quarrel between the two of them.</p><p>Initially, they thought that it was just a private quarrel between the two of them, and no one wanted to pay too much attention to it.</p><p>But now..</p><p>The situation seemed to be different?</p><p>“Path Pattern Initial Stone, what is this thing?”</p><p>“I don’t know, I’ve never heard of it before. But looking at Senior Rao and Xu Xiaoshou’s expressions as if they were fighting over it, it might be a supreme treasure.”</p><p>“It’s not a possibility, it’s a certainty!”</p><p>“Path Pattern Initial Stone…”</p><p>Some people voiced out their doubts, while others began to mutter and ponder.</p><p>The people present were not ordinary people.</p><p>Those who could enter the Tiansang Spirit Palace and rank among the thirty-three people in the inner court all had some sort of background.</p><p>Therefore, after some thought, someone finally seemed to recall something.</p><p>“Isn’t the Path Pattern Initial Stone a treasure used for the realization of the Way of the Heavens at the level of a throne?”</p><p>“This thing is practically the best treasure used for the realization of the Way of the Heavens outside of the Bodhi ancient wood, one of the nine great divine trees.”</p><p>“I heard that if we can find the legendary Path Pattern Initial Stone, we can even directly rely on a stone to comprehend and become a Saint!”</p><p>“Hiss, so powerful?” Someone was shocked.</p><p>“That’s right!”</p><p>“However, how did Senior Rao and Xu Xiaoshou know that there was a ‘Path Pattern Initial Stone?”</p><p>Everyone fell silent upon hearing that.</p><p>Their eyes were filled with confusion, and their intentions were unclear.</p><p>They were indeed on the same team.</p><p>And more than half of them came from the Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>However, the inner court battles were like a small-scale spirit refinement world.</p><p>Moreover, the Tiansang Spirit Palace didn’t stipulate that the treasures found by the White Cave had to be handed over.</p><p>Under such a prerequisite, although the team had also detailed the distribution of the treasures, in front of such a peerless treasure..</p><p>There was only one Path Pattern Initial Stone.</p><p>How was it distributed?</p><p>Sliced up?</p><p>What a joke!</p><p>Only by taking it into their own hands and giving the others some extra compensation would they be able to do the right thing.</p><p>“Senior Rao, is what Xu Xiaoshou said true?”</p><p>“Is there really a ‘Path Pattern Initial Stone’ here?”</p><p>Someone couldn’t help but ask.</p><p>Rao Yinyin’s eyes narrowed, but she didn’t reply.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused by what he saw.</p><p>“Oh, so you didn’t tell anyone else. Does that mean that this was your own idea?”</p><p>“Taking advantage of the fact that no one else was paying attention to it and waiting for the treasure to appear, we should first take it down, then explain ourselves, and then send others away at will?”</p><p>“Or perhaps…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!” Rao Yinyin suddenly shouted, “Don’t go too far!”</p><p>“UH.”</p><p>Looking at Rao Yinyin, who suddenly became serious and somewhat serious, Xu Xiaoshou was taken aback.</p><p>He lowered his eyes and fell into deep thought.</p><p>During this period of time, he had been facing supreme existences like Zhang Taiying, the grey mist figure, and the Night Guardians.</p><p>Fighting with these individuals.</p><p>The slightest carelessness would almost always result in death on the spot.</p><p>So much so that every time before he used a trick, he would habitually think in the worst direction.</p><p>As time passed.</p><p>This kind of speculation and thinking of evil nature did indeed affect his normal words and actions.</p><p>For example, right now.</p><p>Rao Yinyin was only a Tiansang Spirit Palace disciple.</p><p>What bad thoughts could she have?</p><p>At worst, she was just like him, wanting to take the ‘Path Pattern Initial Stone’.</p><p>Not to mention how she got the news.</p><p>Even if her intentions were unclear, anyone would have feelings after being rooted in the Tiansang Spirit Palace for such a long time.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou himself was the same.</p><p>And now, she was using the kind of destructive thoughts that only the grey mist figures would have to maliciously speculate about such a woman.</p><p>It had to be said that even Xu Xiaoshou herself felt that he had gone too far.</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>He nodded solemnly, but his gaze also became serious. “But, I can’t let the Path Pattern Initial Stone go.”</p><p>The scene fell silent.</p><p>The atmosphere suddenly became a little somber.</p><p>Everyone quietly moved and stood together with their friends who were familiar with them.</p><p>Soon, the situation could be seen at a glance.</p><p>Although everyone had their own thoughts.</p><p>At the critical moment, the team from Tiansang Spirit Palace still stood together.</p><p>Behind Xu Xiaoshou, there were only two people, Mu Yu and Zhou Tianshen.</p><p>As for Su Qianqian..</p><p>Even though this little girl was already mature, she was still in a dilemma.</p><p>On one side was her Sister Rao.</p><p>On the other side was Brother Xiaoshou..</p><p>This…</p><p>Why did it suddenly seem like they were going to fight?</p><p>Su Qianqian pursed her lips and wanted to speak.</p><p>But when she saw the two of them looking at each other without saying a word, she didn’t know what to say.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>Rao Yinyin retracted her gaze from the cowering Zhou Tianshen and said calmly, “If I remember correctly, the back mountain, the waterfall, and the Sovereign Pill.”</p><p>“UH…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s stoic face immediately relaxed, and his mouth that was ready to fire was momentarily silenced.</p><p>“Cough cough, yes, I, Xu Xiaoshou, am a man of my word. I still owe you a Sovereign Pill.”</p><p>“Very good.” Rao Yinyin’s red lips curled up. “So?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head. “So it still won’t do. The Sovereign Pill is the Sovereign Pill. When we get out of the White Cave, I can even buy it for you.”</p><p>“But the ‘Path Pattern Initial Stone’ is different. This thing is very important to me. I have to get it.”</p><p>“It’s also very important to me.” Rao Yinyin bit her lip. Her voice was equally determined.</p><p>“Since it’s so important, let’s use our own methods. After all, there are only the two of us here…”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou spoke, his voice suddenly stopped.</p><p>The two of them turned their heads at the same time.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>At the same time, the protective barrier around them exploded after a wave of light.</p><p>“Crack crack.”</p><p>Rao Yinyin clenched her fists so tightly that they made cracking sounds. She gave Xu Xiaoshou a fierce look.</p><p>“Jinx!”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not expect that he could be so effective.</p><p>Did he open his mouth?</p><p>He had not even spoken when he was already here?</p><p>He looked over and saw that after breaking the formation, a huge number of black figures had arrived.</p><p>There were more than twenty of them.</p><p>In terms of numbers, they couldn’t even compare to the people in the area.</p><p>Similarly, in terms of quality..</p><p>With a single glance, he could see that more than half of them were Grandmaster Realm experts.</p><p>There were elder and young people, both of them.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“Where did this group of people come from?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that even if there were illegal immigrants in the White Cave.</p><p>In name, it was also a training ground for the younger generation.</p><p>These guys weren’t young on average, and they didn’t look like the descendants of normal aristocratic families.</p><p>Instead, they looked more like..</p><p>A thought flashed through her mind.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou recalled that there was indeed a special group of people in the White Cave.</p><p>However, shouldn’t these people who came to the White Cave as Spirit Array Caster be restrained by Red Robe and focused on cracking the so-called “Thirty-Six Heavens Sealed Array”?</p><p>“What happened to the Fourth Sword?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately thought of many things.</p><p>Not many people could be remembered by “Perception”. After all, it was too complicated.</p><p>However, it was true that there were several faces inside. He had seen them at the big teleportation array in the eight palaces.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Fu Xing put out the bonfire and stood up.</p><p>He was the one who had set up this protective barrier. Now that it was broken, he was the first one who couldn’t get through.</p><p>“Who are you…”</p><p>The leader of the uninvited guests was a man wearing a black robe, a big hood, and a mask. His face couldn’t be seen clearly at all.</p><p>Judging from his voice, he seemed to be very young. At least, he wasn’t a middle-aged man.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>He glanced at the people inside the enchantment and suddenly burst into laughter.</p><p>The laughter was so abrupt.</p><p>However, when he laughed, the people behind him had to laugh as well.</p><p>Instantly, a series of casual and dry laughter rang out in the scene.</p><p>“What the hell…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was embarrassed when he heard it.</p><p>If he had not been able to directly see the cultivation level of the opposite party, he would have thought that the “Saint Servant” had come just by looking at his attire.</p><p>But, Saint Servant?</p><p>This was at most a low-quality version!</p><p>And it was the lowest-quality version, without a doubt.</p><p>Rao Yinyin looked at each other, and both of them saw the strange look in each other’s eyes.</p><p>They did not say anything.</p><p>At the same time, everyone chose to continue watching.</p><p>“Who am I?”</p><p>After the black-robed boss finished laughing, he suddenly stopped. “Brothers, tell them who I am and what we are going to do!”</p><p>Under everyone’s gaze, the black-robed second brother walked out from the side of the black-robed boss.</p><p>“You coming into the White Cave, do the people in Tiansang Spirit Palace know?” He flung his sleeves and stood with his hands behind his back.</p><p>“Uh huh.”</p><p>Fu Xing nodded.</p><p>How could he not know about the county under his jurisdiction?</p><p>“Then, does the City Lord of Tiansang Spirit Palace know about it?”</p><p>“Uh Huh.”</p><p>Fu Xing and Fu Yinhong looked at each other before nodding.</p><p>My house, what’s wrong?</p><p>“Hahaha, if you all know each other, then it’s easy to handle!”</p><p>That person laughed out loud and continued to ask, “Since you’ve come to the White Cave, you shouldn’t have only stayed here before, right? Did you know about the birth of the famous Swordsman Flame Python?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was suddenly startled.</p><p>He looked at the attire of the leading man beside the speaker, and suddenly, a strange feeling rose in his heart.</p><p>He opened his mouth.</p><p>He suddenly wanted to say something, but in the end, he chose to wait and see again.</p><p>Fu Xing frowned. He did not know what the opposite party was trying to say.</p><p>Famous Swordsman?</p><p>Was It related to this group of people coming over?</p><p>“I’ve heard of it.” He continued to nod.</p><p>“You’ve heard of it too? That’s even better!”</p><p>The black-robed man who spoke seemed to be even happier. He continued to cross his fingers. “Spirit Fusion Swamp, have you heard of it?”</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils constricted.</p><p>Why did this string of nouns seem to be related to him?</p><p>Fu Xing, on the other hand, was confused. “I’ve heard of it, but what does it have to do with you?”</p><p>“Heh.”</p><p>The black-robed man sneered disdainfully. “What does it have to do with me? That’s a big one.”</p><p>“This one!”</p><p>He pointed at the leading man and said in a respectful tone,</p><p>“He was the one who seized eighteen spots in the White Cave in the mansion of the City Lord of Tiansang Spirit Palace. He was the first to take down the famous swordsman Flame Python in the White Cave and then went to the Spirit Fusion Swamp to empty the treasures inside. He also blew up that place — Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“Excuse me, do you know him?”</p><p>With a bang, Fu Xing staggered.</p><p>His face twitched as he looked at the leader of the so-called “Xu Xiaoshou” and was momentarily speechless.</p><p>Know him?</p><p>Not only know him?</p><p>I even sat with Xu Xiaoshou just now!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Almost at the same time.</p><p>As the black-robed man finished speaking.</p><p>Fu Xing and the others, including everyone in the Tiansang Spirit Palace team, turned their heads at the same time and saw where Xu Xiaoshou was.</p><p>Surprise, strangeness, confusion..</p><p>All kinds of emotions were present.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“No way, he came to the White Cave and has already done so many things?”</p><p>“Famous swordsman?”</p><p>“I heard that when that wave of famous swords appeared, not only were there people from the legendary sword burial mound in the Middle East region, even Red Coat and Ghost Beasts appeared.”</p><p>“So, it was Xu Xiaoshou who took the famous swords?”</p><p>“That’s not important, alright? The Spirit Fusion Swamp is where the real ghost beasts appeared. I heard that it was even a sealed ghost beast.”</p><p>“But wasn’t it rumored that the battle between the Ghost Beasts and Red Coat led to the explosion of the entire Spirit Fusion Swamp?”</p><p>“Why? Is it related to Xu Xiaoshou again?”</p><p>“This fellow doesn’t change at all. He appears every time there’s an explosion?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The discussion went wild.</p><p>Almost everyone subconsciously chose to ignore that “Xu Xiaoshou” opposite them. Instead, they looked at the real Xu Xiaoshou they knew and started discussing.</p><p>The situation was very obvious.</p><p>No matter how real the story was.</p><p>Li Gui met Li Kui.</p><p>It could only be said that the information was well done.</p><p>However, these people seemed to have never seen the real Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“It seems that you are the leader?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou”, who was sitting across from him, looked at the group of people who turned around at the same time and shifted his gaze from Fu Xing to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Leader?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately shook his head and denied, “No, I’m not.”</p><p>“You’re not?”</p><p>That person sneered, “If you’re not the leader, then why are they looking at you? They’re waiting for you to make a statement!”</p><p>“What stance do I want to express?” Xu Xiaoshou was startled.</p><p>“Hehe.”</p><p>“What stance? Isn’t it obvious?”</p><p>“We have more than twenty brothers and we’re tired of fighting everywhere. Now, we need to use this place to rest.”</p><p>“As for you guys…”</p><p>As he spoke, he looked around at everyone and swung the back of his hand, “Scram!”</p><p>“Hua!”</p><p>His indifferent tone immediately ignited the spirit palace team’s anger.</p><p>“Buzz off! We were the ones who came here first. The protective barrier has already been set up. You guys broke the spirit array without saying anything and even trespassed.”</p><p>“The ones who should scram are you guys!”</p><p>“That’s right. What Xu Xiaoshou… I think you’re tired of living.”</p><p>“Let me give you a piece of advice. Take advantage of the fact that a certain someone hasn’t lost his temper yet and quickly leave. Otherwise, when the time comes, you won’t even know how to cry.”</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>“Get out of here!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
