He looked up and said, “You said that you would not force me to make a choice.”</p><p>The storyteller could not help but laugh when he heard this. He opened his mouth and spoke.</p><p>The masked man reached out his hand to stop him and said calmly, “I never break my promise to others. But Wen Ming, you have to think clearly. Do you really want to run?”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>The storyteller immediately became anxious.</p><p>This was a young man whom he had paid a great price but still could not catch.</p><p>Did his brother mean to let him go?</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“He’s mine!”</p><p>The storyteller brazenly defended his sovereignty.</p><p>The masked man turned his head and glared at him.</p><p>The latter retracted his long neck and obediently fell silent.</p><p>Damn it..</p><p>As expected, he still couldn’t hold on until the third sentence?</p><p>Wen Ming is mine! ! ! !</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou ignored this fellow and only looked at the masked man. He said resolutely, “That’s right, I don’t want to go with you.”</p><p>“Do you have a way out?”The masked man asked.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Where?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around and looked behind him.</p><p>“The world is so big, there will definitely be places which will become my home?”</p><p>“Do you really think so?”The masked man pressed him step by step.</p><p>“Or what?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head. “If I really go with you, I will really be in a quagmire, right? Although I don’t know what the Saint Servant is going to do, but…”</p><p>He hesitated and could not continue.</p><p>The Saint Servant’s goal was very clear and grand.</p><p>Even if Xu Xiaoshou did not know what it was, he could still sense it from his repeated contact with the masked man.</p><p>If he really joined, if nothing unexpected happened, he would have to face the entire Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already decided when the masked man had first invited him.</p><p>Rather than joining the dark and evil organization, it would be better to directly choose the Holy Divine Palace, the number one power on the continent.</p><p>At least, in there, he should still be considered as one of the good and kind!</p><p>Disappointment appeared in the eyes of the masked man.</p><p>He seemed to have seen through Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts.</p><p>“Turn around.”</p><p>Seeing that Xu Xiaoshou was looking over, the masked man pointed behind him and said, “Look over there.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated and turned his head again.</p><p>The end of the ravine behind him was the horizon of the White Cave.</p><p>Further up was the space world of the white cave that was about to be shattered.</p><p>“What do you see?”The masked man asked.</p><p>“The road, and hope,”Xu Xiaoshou answered.</p><p>“Ha!”</p><p>The masked man could not help but laugh. “Is that true?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded heavily.</p><p>“Is the White Cave Big?”The masked man asked again.</p><p>“It’s very big.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated for a moment. “But it’s also very small.”</p><p>After all, it was such a big white cave, yet he could always run into a wall. It was really rare!</p><p>“Yes, the White Cave is not big.”</p><p>The masked man heaved a sigh of relief and continued to ask, “So what did you encounter in the White Cave?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou could not say anything. He could vaguely sense that the masked man was trying to hide from him.</p><p>“Opportunity, hope, and the future.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was evasive and added, “If it weren’t for you guys…”</p><p>“You’re wrong!”</p><p>The masked man interrupted him on the spot.</p><p>His shoulders were slightly stretched back. He had never puffed out his chest, but in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes, it was as if he had grown a few feet taller. His aura had reached its peak with such a slight movement.</p><p>“If I’m not wrong, you met the famed sword in the White Cave,”the masked man asserted.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded.</p><p>He, could really sense it?</p><p>“The ultimate fire attribute, infernal power… Only the famed sword Flame Python is left. Am I right?”The masked man smiled confidently.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his throat dry up.</p><p>His famed sword had already recognized its owner, and he had placed it in the Yuan mansion.</p><p>How could the masked man still be able to detect it?</p><p>“You…”</p><p>“You don’t have to say anything. I can just say it.”</p><p>The masked man once again interrupted Xu Xiaoshou and said, “You encountered the famed sword, but this sword doesn’t belong to you. It was given to you by someone else.”</p><p>“If my guess is correct and you took this sword, you should be very regretful now.”The Masked Man’s eyes contained a smile.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou:”…”</p><p>“The White Cave is so big. This is the opportunity you mentioned.”</p><p>The masked man said, “A charitable donation from someone else… Sorry, it’s too harsh. It should be said to be a gift!”</p><p>“I don’t regret it.”Xu Xiaoshou was stubborn.</p><p>“You are just being stubborn.”</p><p>The masked man smiled brightly and said, “The last time I saw Zyou, the infernal power in your body was not so strong…”</p><p>“Infernal original seed?”</p><p>Sensing the aura in Wen Ming’s body, the masked man turned his head to look at the storyteller and asked, “You should be able to sense the existence of this thing when you entered the White Cave. If nothing unexpected happens, will you go and fight for it?”</p><p>“UH…”</p><p>Cold sweat broke out on the storyteller’s forehead.</p><p>He had never told his brother about this..</p><p>But how could this be pushed out?</p><p>“It’s normal.”</p><p>“It’s for second brother.”</p><p>The masked man couldn’t stop smiling. He looked at Xu Xiaoshou again and said, “You took the infernal original seed, and then the storyteller took a fancy to you. Am I right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little flustered.</p><p>He felt that this masked man was worthy of being the chief of the Saint Servant.</p><p>His brain was simply amazing!</p><p>It was as if he had been watching this world from the perspective of God.</p><p>“The white cave was so big. You wandered around twice and obtained a famed sword and the infernal original seed</p><p>“Then, you were sucked into two whirlpools</p><p>“Do you regret it?”</p><p>Without waiting for Xu Xiaoshou’s reply, the masked man answered his own question, “I regret it.”</p><p>“If I could throw away these two things in exchange for freedom, I think it would be acceptable…”</p><p>“Have you thought about it?”</p><p>“When you are at your most helpless.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was silent.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu was watching from the side with his arms crossed.</p><p>Looking at the hesitant expression of the young man below, he could sense the other party’s true thoughts.</p><p>It was probably more than just thinking about it. It was possible that he would regret it too late!</p><p>But..</p><p>Secretly glancing at the chief, Cen Qiaofu was a little surprised.</p><p>The last time the chief spoke so much in one go was when he met that child in the ruins of that broken family.</p><p>Then, there was Lei shuangxing.</p><p>Was this Wen Ming worth it?</p><p>The masked man looked at the silent Xu Xiaoshou and his voice sank:</p><p>“The White Cave is so big. When you turn around, you will see the hope you spoke of — gain, but also loss!”</p><p>“Isn’t that ridiculous?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart trembled.</p><p>He already knew what the masked man wanted to do.</p><p>Opportunity, hope, and the future..</p><p>The three directions that he had mentioned just now, this fellow actually wanted to completely deny himself?</p><p>“My future, I can control it myself!”Xu Xiaoshou’s voice was filled with anger.</p><p>“Is that really so?”</p><p>The masked man looked disapproving. “Go back to the question I asked you just now…”</p><p>“Turn back.”</p><p>He suddenly spoke in a commanding tone.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was determined not to turn back.</p><p>How could he let the other party get what he wanted?</p><p>“Woodcutter.”</p><p>The masked man turned his head to look at Cen Qiaofu, who was looking forward to a good show.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu held his forehead as if he had a headache.</p><p>“Seriously, do it yourself!”</p><p>His fingers on his waist trembled.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was below him, realized in horror that the scene in front of him had completely changed.</p><p>In front of him, except for the three saint servants, they were still in their original positions. However, everything that he could see had become a scene that he could only see when he turned his head.</p><p>“Forced to turn back?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded.</p><p>In the next second, he suddenly came to a realization, and great waves surged in his heart.</p><p>No.</p><p>It was not turning back.</p><p>But, the world had changed?</p><p>He looked at Cen Qiaofu with a shocked expression. At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was filled with helplessness.</p><p>Cutting Path..</p><p>This was cutting path?</p><p>How could he change the world? !</p><p>“See?”</p><p>The masked man spread his hands.</p><p>“In this small white cave, even if you don’t want to turn back, there are still people who can let people see everything that you don’t want to see</p><p>“And reality is really like this.”</p><p>“What you don’t dare to face is the fear of the unknown that comes from the depths of your soul.”</p><p>“But, is it useful?”</p><p>“When you stand here, you are already at the center of the vortex of the storm.”</p><p>“No matter how determined, no matter how stubborn…”</p><p>“At the end of the day, you are just deceiving yourself.”</p><p>There was a hint of mockery in the masked man’s eyes. It was as if he was not only targeting Xu Xiaoshou, but also looking at himself.</p><p>“The gears of fate bite together and push forward step by step. Do you think that you can stay out of this by covering your eyes?”</p><p>“Wrong!”</p><p>“Doing this will only cause you to be crushed by the gears in your numbness.”</p><p>“Open your eyes and face reality!”</p><p>The masked man’s tone had a hint of helplessness. “You have already stood here…”</p><p>He pointed at the ground.</p><p>“Beside me.”</p><p>..</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his heart shake.</p><p>If this was a speech, he could even give the masked man an eighty-two point rating.</p><p>Even if he did not want to admit it, the current Xu Xiaoshou really felt as if he had been enlightened.</p><p>The other party’s words were very reserved.</p><p>However, how could Xu Xiaoshou not hear it.</p><p>“After being involved, it’s going to be difficult to stay out of it!”</p><p>There were also all sorts of excuses, such as Elder Sang’s coercion, Red Coat’s sniping, Caramel’s liking, and the wretched Saint’s choice..</p><p>These were all facts!</p><p>Even if there were all sorts of preconditions, the fact was that there were no preconditions.</p><p>Even if it was passive.</p><p>At this moment, he had indeed stepped into the eyes of many people.</p><p>“To be independent?”</p><p>For the first time, Xu Xiaoshou felt how ridiculous the choice he made was!</p><p>In a situation where big shots gathered, he actually wanted to be independent?</p><p>Just because he wanted to be independent, he had walked step by step from Elder Sang’s arrangement to the sight of Red coat, then to the Saint’s chess game, and then to being targeted by the Ghost Beast..</p><p>Thinking back.</p><p>Wasn’t all of this already a fact, warning him that his choice was wrong!</p><p>“Self-deception…”</p><p>To be honest, Xu Xiaoshou did not want to face this term.</p><p>But what the masked man said did expose the bloody reality.</p><p>Choosing to stay on his own.</p><p>He had encountered so many things in just this short period of time.</p><p>If he continued to persevere, would he be able to hold on?</p><p>Now, all parties had chosen him.</p><p>But did he really have the potential to allow them to have the patience to wait until he grew up?</p><p>It wouldn’t go that far..</p><p>Once one of the chains broke.</p><p>They wanted to use force.</p><p>The layer of gauze between fantasy and reality couldn’t even withstand a gentle poke.</p><p>“Night Guardian…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of the night guardian.</p><p>From the indulgence in the beginning, to the tolerance after understanding his own thoughts, to the incomplete break at this moment..</p><p>How long did it take?</p><p>If he persisted, would it be a real break?</p><p>At that time, would he be able to withstand the real anger of the cutting path expert?</p><p>Would the night guardian still act like a child and let his temper run wild?</p><p>“And the Ghost Beast, and the Saint Servant…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath.</p><p>He finally understood.</p><p>He was indeed too naive.</p><p>The White Cave was very big, but it was also very small.</p><p>The Shengshen continent was very big, but it was also very small.</p><p>At the moment, he was barely a good chess piece and could play a bit of a role in the future, so the chess player would indulge his little temper.</p><p>However, once his strength broke through and reached a certain critical point…</p><p>Could the other party tolerate such willfulness?</p><p>“Because it’s about to get out of control, he has no choice but to make a move and kill it in advance?”</p><p>“Destroy it if he can’t get it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou understood these people’s train of thoughts too well.</p><p>In fact, it was very likely that the masked man in front of him had the same thoughts.</p><p>Then, in this cruel reality..</p><p>“Compromise?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little shaken.</p><p>The words of the masked man tore open his hand that was covering his eyes.</p><p>After seeing the direction clearly, Xu Xiaoshou finally understood how difficult the road in front of him was.</p><p>Compromise was really a good choice!</p><p>Taking a side..</p><p>At the very least, after taking a side, this kind of difficult situation would no longer appear, right?</p><p>It was better to lean against a big tree for shade.</p><p>With someone behind him, even if he had finished playing the cards in his hands, they would still present him with dozens of stacks of cards, right?</p><p>This was completely different from fighting alone.</p><p>There were no worries. He only needed to crush all the enemies in front of him.</p><p>Then..</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts came to this point, and he suddenly froze.</p><p>Then, what was it?</p><p>Why did he do this?</p><p>To become a real chess piece?</p><p>A chill suddenly seeped out from his soul, and Xu Xiaoshou felt a chill permeate his body.</p><p>He thought of the firm belief he had when he stood up in the ancient book’s space.</p><p>“For freedom!”</p><p>And if he chose to compromise, was it still for freedom?</p><p>..</p><p>“You are wrong.”</p><p>The masked man remained silent until Xu Xiaoshou’s expression underwent a drastic transformation. He then interrupted, “I know what you are worried about.”</p><p>“However, humans are not lonely animals.”</p><p>“A person’s path, no matter how straight it is, will always be incomplete.”</p><p>“At this moment, I am by your side.”</p><p>“To you, I am the sky, the umbrella, the resistive force.”</p><p>“But to me, you really don’t have much value now. You are a useless chess piece.”</p><p>“It’s very cruel, right?”</p><p>The masked man smiled and said, “But what about from another angle?”</p><p>“Tool!”</p><p>“Before you grow up, I am your tool. Just use me well. Why think so much?”</p><p>“The reason why humans can improve is because they constantly use tools.”</p><p>“Stone weapon, fire weapon, spiritual weapon…”</p><p>“Body, Will, Spiritual Source…”</p><p>“Which step of growth and evolution does not involve the so-called ‘Tools’?”</p><p>“All things can be used as tools, humans included. They are not more noble than plants, flowers, and stones. Why can’t they be used?”</p><p>“And why…”</p><p>The masked man’s tone turned cold as he pierced into the depths of his soul, “When you picked up the famed sword, you could be undistracted and yet when using humans as a sword, you began to worry about gains and losses?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt as if his brain was pierced through by the sword will. The pain caused him to bend his back and curl up with his head in his hands.</p><p>The storyteller was a little surprised.</p><p>“Take it easy, take it easy…”</p><p>He looked at Little Wen Ming with worry in his eyes.</p><p>The other party was just a child, he could not be so violent!</p><p>The masked man did not care. He stretched his hand to the side and spread four fingers.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu looked at the hand in front of him and was stunned. What did he mean?</p><p>“My Gourd.”The masked man rolled his eyes and said.</p><p>“Oh, oh.”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu finally reacted and complained, “Seriously, can’t you bring your own things with you?”</p><p>As he spoke, he took out a small black gourd and slapped it onto the masked man’s hand.</p><p>..</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>The masked man’s sword will was too strong.</p><p>With just a few words, he felt his soul split open.</p><p>But..</p><p>Compromise?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou really couldn’t do it!</p><p>He insisted on himself and his freedom. If his faith had collapsed, how could he continue to walk down the road?</p><p>The masked man had his reasons for what he said.</p><p>But it was not realistic to put it on himself!</p><p>And he could not empathize with it either!</p><p>“Sigh.”</p><p>A low sigh echoed in the air.</p><p>The masked man reached out his hand and pressed it against his neck. He pulled it up and lifted the mask up to his nose.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression suddenly shook.</p><p>In the image transmitted by “Perception”, there was a large scar on the other party’s neck. wasn’t it the same as the sculpted man he saw in the spiritual library division?</p><p>Wasn’t it the unique symbol on the scruffy-looking man’s body when he had encountered red dog that day?</p><p>This..</p><p>Was it the same person?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts suddenly became chaotic.</p><p>The jaw line of the masked man was very tough, but his beard was unkempt, and there were also dried blood scabs. He was simply in an extremely chaotic state.</p><p>He wiped his mouth and removed the blood that he had spat out earlier. Then, he flicked the stopper of the gourd with his fingers.</p><p>The air was suddenly filled with the smell of strong alcohol.</p><p>It was very strong.</p><p>It was very pungent.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was woken up by the sudden smell.</p><p>“Young people are always so stubborn!”</p><p>The masked man aimed the wine gourd at his mouth. Just as he was about to raise his head, he suddenly thought of something.</p><p>“I have said enough, but I should add one more sentence.”</p><p>He put down his hand and looked up at the sky.</p><p>“White Cave, what color is it?”</p><p>The two people on the side couldn’t help but look up.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also recovered slightly from the pain in his soul and raised his head.</p><p>“Crimson…”</p><p>The three people murmured at the same time.</p><p>There was no sun and moon in the world of White Cave, but the sky had always been crimson.</p><p>“Yes, Crimson.”</p><p>The masked man sighed, “So, this world is not black and white, so how can there be absolutes?”</p><p>“Right and wrong, good and evil, light and darkness, earth and the sky…”</p><p>“These are just words given to things by people, how can there be absolutes?”</p><p>“If that’s the case, then compromise and freedom, are they really opposing?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind felt like it was being struck by lightning, and his train of thought was split open.</p><p>These words were very familiar.</p><p>It was exactly what he had said to the night guardian previously.</p><p>However, the content that was used to avoid the night guardian at that time, when it came out from the mouth of the masked man, had a different flavor?</p><p>“Ha!”</p><p>The masked man shook his head and chuckled.</p><p>“If the White Cave is broken and the Shengshen continent is broken, is it really the end of the world?”</p><p>“Not exactly!”</p><p>He pondered for a moment, as if he was speaking to himself:</p><p>“You use subjectivity to define the world, but you demand yourself to follow the opposing rules of the subjectively defined world. Isn’t it ridiculous?”</p><p>“Ridiculous!”</p><p>“Compromise and freedom are not a set of words that restrict each other.”</p><p>“He is merely a choice of your subjective consciousness.”</p><p>“It is merely a ‘choice’!”</p><p>“The point is, it is merely a ‘choice’!”</p><p>“No matter how you look at it, it comes from yourself…”</p><p>“That’s all I have to say.”</p><p>Looking at Wen Ming, whose eyes were filled with endless confusion, the masked man kept his mouth shut.</p><p>He wiped his mouth again and wiped away the dry dead skin on his lips. Holding the wine gourd, he raised his head.</p><p>The space was shattered and the sound of the wind was chilling, causing his black robe to rustle.</p><p>“Freedom, who doesn’t yearn for it?”</p><p>His adam’s apple rolled.</p><p>“Gulp Gulp…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
