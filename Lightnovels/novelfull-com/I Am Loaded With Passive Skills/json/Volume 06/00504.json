The spiritual source in his energy reserve shook, and the calamity power was instantly swallowed by the darkness.</p><p>He looked at the ancient book.</p><p>After a long time, he seemed to finally understand something.</p><p>“Phantom spiritual weapon?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>The Storyteller nodded without any hesitation.</p><p>The Night Guardian’s eyes finally had a hint of realization.</p><p>When he looked at the ancient book again, his face was even more surprised.</p><p>“The phantom spiritual weapon is already so strong. If the real body comes, wouldn’t it be able to directly seal the Small World White Cave?”</p><p>As he thought of this, he felt that he had already found the reason why the other party was so weak.</p><p>“Wait…”</p><p>“The real body?”</p><p>His thoughts suddenly came to a halt, and the Night Guardian was stunned. “So, the ancient book is fake. What about you? Are you fake as well?”</p><p>The Storyteller finally revealed the most brilliant smile, and his silver teeth shone brightly under the crimson sky.</p><p>“You can say that.”</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>“No wonder…”</p><p>The Night Guardian shook his head and could not help but exclaim, “No wonder! I was wondering how could the seventh master of the Saint Servant be taken down so easily by me.”</p><p>“Wait.”</p><p>“You’re fake?”</p><p>Only then did he came back to his senses and shock surged in his heart.</p><p>“How could fakes give off such a real feeling?”</p><p>“How could it be? I can’t even tell the difference when I’m in the Cutting Path State…”</p><p>The Night Guardian thought of an unrealistic idea. He couldn’t help but exclaim, “Avatar? Demi-Saint State?”</p><p>“Hehe.”</p><p>The Storyteller’s eyes were filled with mockery. He clicked his tongue and said, “Your combat strength is not bad, but your brain… compared to that guy outside, you’re much slower!”</p><p>“That guy outside, Heiming?”</p><p>The Night Guardian completely understood.</p><p>It turned out that after fighting for so long, he was only fighting with an avatar.</p><p>Even under the weapon prohibition order, he had fought an avatar that the other party could abandon at any time?</p><p>But he could not understand…</p><p>“Even if it’s an avatar, I can see that your cultivation has not reached the Demi-Saint State, not even the Higher Void.”</p><p>“How did you do it?”</p><p>The frost power in his hand surged even more strongly.</p><p>But the Night Guardian didn’t care.</p><p>He was completely attracted.</p><p>He could create an avatar in the Cutting Path State?</p><p>It was completely impossible!</p><p>“Do I have to answer you just because you asked?”</p><p>The Storyteller wiped away the blood on his face. He suddenly stopped and asked, “Actually, it’s not impossible, but you have to tell me first.”</p><p>“You are at the Cutting Path State and yet you haven’t even gone through the Nine Death Thunder Calamity.”</p><p>“How did you figure out the Power of the Higher Void?”</p><p>Night Guardian’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>“Exchange?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Ha, impossible.” Night Guardian sneered.</p><p>How could he exchange the biggest secret of the Holy Divine Palace just like that?</p><p>“If you don’t tell me, let me guess.”</p><p>The Storyteller pinched his fingers, and the scene of the battle reappeared in his mind.</p><p>“The dark type is an innate attribute. Even if one successfully reaches the Cutting Path and transcends the Nine Death Thunder Calamity, the Power of the Higher Void that one can comprehend will not be the Grand Vital Energy.”</p><p>“How can two opposite powers be combined in one body?”</p><p>“So, your Power of the Higher Void is not something that you comprehend on your own, but from someone else!”</p><p>The Storyteller smiled. “Did I guess correctly?”</p><p>The Night Guardian did not say anything. His expression did not change, and nothing could be seen at all.</p><p>The Storyteller continued, “This should be your biggest secret, right?”</p><p>“That’s true. You have heard of me, so without knowing that I’m an avatar, you went all out.”</p><p>“Even when you realized that my power was strange and stopped, it was already too late.”</p><p>He leaned over and giggled. He covered his red lips and said in a low voice, “You want to use all your strength to take me down so that you can take credit for it, right?”</p><p>“What a pity. In the end, you realized that you were only fighting an avatar.”</p><p>“It was a futile effort.”</p><p>“You didn’t catch me, but instead, you exposed your biggest secret to me.”</p><p>“The Power of the Higher Void…”</p><p>The Storyteller chuckled.</p><p>After a long while, his expression turned solemn and his voice turned cold. “Which teammate of yours did you kill and then plunder him?”</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The Night Guardian waved his ice crystal hand that was holding onto the ancient book.</p><p>The Storyteller was instantly shot into the sky like a cannonball.</p><p>After a long while, there was a loud bang and he crashed onto the ground again.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>“Cough cough, heh, heh heh…”</p><p>The Storyteller touched the blood at the corner of his lips and laughed again. “You’re so embarrassed that you’re angry.”</p><p>The Night Guardian’s face darkened as he stepped forward.</p><p>But at this moment, he did not wait to make another move.</p><p>The sound from the ancient book seemed to have completely changed, becoming clear and audible.</p><p>“Ka Ka –”</p><p>“Ka Ka –”</p><p>The temperature of the air suddenly dropped.</p><p>This time, not only did the Night Guardian’s hand that was holding the book turn into ice crystals.</p><p>Under the influence of the frozen power, his entire arm and half of his body were instantly frozen.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The Night Guardian’s body shook, once again shattering the icy aura.</p><p>He looked at the ancient book in surprise.</p><p>Why does it feel like something’s wrong?</p><p>He came back to his senses and looked around again.</p><p>While he was in a daze, the surrounding scenery had undergone an earth-shattering change.</p><p>A thick layer of ice crystals had frozen everything within a radius of several hundred feet.</p><p>Even the Storyteller, who was lying on the ground and could not get up in time, had turned into an ice sculpture that could not move under the sudden drop in temperature.</p><p>“This?”</p><p>The Night Guardian was shocked.</p><p>What he sensed earlier was only the aura of the ancient book’s space being shattered.</p><p>However, after a few sentences, the Way of Space inside was completely suppressed by the Way of Ice?</p><p>“How is this possible?”</p><p>How could there be an aura that was stronger than the shattered Way of Space in the ancient book’s space?</p><p>“All?”</p><p>The Night Guardian suddenly remembered the word in the Storyteller’s words just now.</p><p>“Could it be that this guy did release some mighty figure that was sealed inside before he died?”</p><p>The Night Guardian’s expression became uncertain.</p><p>He couldn’t be blamed for being paranoid.</p><p>When this ice crystal world overthrew everything, he could feel a very familiar feeling. He was about to face it, but he didn’t dare to…</p><p>Calamity power!</p><p>This calamity power would only appear when he was transcending the Nine Death Thunder Calamity.</p><p>Now, this aura was mixed in with a large amount of the icy aura. This would mean that…</p><p>The person who was about to escape from the ancient book’s space would at least be a Cutting Path existence who had truly transcended the Nine Death Thunder Calamity?</p><p>Perhaps, it wasn’t just a Cutting Path existence!</p><p>Perhaps, it wasn’t just one!</p><p>“Chi Chi!”</p><p>Cold air began to rise from the ground.</p><p>In just an instant, the snowflakes that filled the sky slowly withered.</p><p>The Night Guardian felt that he could no longer hold on to the ancient book.</p><p>The dense frozen power that came from his palm had instantly seeped into his energy reserve.</p><p>Caught off guard, a small portion of the spiritual source in his energy reserve had already been frozen.</p><p>“Darkness, devour the sky!”</p><p>The Night Guardian couldn’t help but put aside the ancient book and put his palms together.</p><p>In an instant, his energy reserve turned into a dark vortex that spun crazily and devoured the frozen power in his body.</p><p>He glanced at the sky.</p><p>Heavy snow was falling.</p><p>At this moment, he didn’t even see a trace of redness when he looked up at the sky. Only dense snowflakes covered his eyes.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>The order was given.</p><p>Darkness began to engulf the ground and crept into the sky, dyeing this white world completely black.</p><p>Only then did the Night Guardian feel relieved.</p><p>But soon after.</p><p>“Crack –”</p><p>A sound unexpectedly came from the darkness that was supposed to devour all the scenery in the world!</p><p>The Night Guardian was shocked.</p><p>He raised his head to look and finally found that his Night Curtain only covered an area of several thousand feet in circumference.</p><p>However, snowflakes were still flying outside!</p><p>“What… is this?”</p><p>He was shocked.</p><p>The darkness that he had summoned seemed to be restricted by the ice power.</p><p>It was as if there was an invisible spatial barrier that trapped him inside.</p><p>An absurd thought suddenly appeared in the Night Guardian’s mind.</p><p>This situation was as if he was sitting inside a huge invisible alchemy cauldron.</p><p>The ice power was like a flame, roasting him inside.</p><p>And he, who was inside the cauldron, was as tiny as a pill.</p><p>No matter how much he struggled, the darkness wanted to expand.</p><p>Once he touched the wall of the cauldron, it would be difficult for him to expand.</p><p>“What the hell!”</p><p>The Night Guardian didn’t dare to be careless. He stepped forward, kicking the ice crystal that trapped the Storyteller into pieces.</p><p>“Was it a seal ghost beast or ice ghost beast that was sealed in your ancient book space?”</p><p>“Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle…”</p><p>“Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle, gurgle…”</p><p>The Storyteller’s entire face was frozen into a greenish-purple color.</p><p>Under the weapon prohibition order, the spiritual source in his body could not be used at all. How could he withstand the frozen power?</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>The Night Guardian pressed his palm down and directly absorbed the power in his body. Only then did the Storyteller feel better.</p><p>“I… I…I’m…”</p><p>“N-no, n-not, su-sure…”</p><p>“Speak in human language!”</p><p>The Night Guardian slapped the stuttering person’s face.</p><p>“Clack, Clack!”</p><p>The Storyteller’s silver teeth were slapped away.</p><p>However, the pain seemed to have awakened a little bit of consciousness. He covered his face, his eyes filled with shock.</p><p>“No, something’s not right…”</p><p>“I, I am only…”</p><p>He suddenly stopped talking.</p><p>There were some things that the Night Guardian did not know, but the Storyteller knew everything.</p><p>This phantom ancient book of his had not been created for a long time, and it had only been completed before he returned to the Eastern Region.</p><p>And once he arrived in the Eastern Region, he found his brother and entered the White Cave.</p><p>Although there was some time during this period.</p><p>However, there weren’t any almighty experts that were truly sealed within the ancient book space.</p><p>It was even more impossible for ice attribute experts to exist.</p><p>The truly good stuff was all within the ancient book space!</p><p>The only thing that could make sense…</p><p>Seal ghost beasts?</p><p>“So, this ice attribute comes from the Three Days Frozen Calamity, and it comes from the seal ghost beast?”</p><p>“But, that’s not right!”</p><p>The Storyteller was confused again.</p><p>Even though he knew that the seal ghost beast might choose to devour the Three Days Frozen Calamity in the ancient book space.</p><p>But if it wanted, it would devour it.</p><p>Even if the seal attribute could seal the Three Days Frozen Calamity but if it wasn’t given time to do so, it wouldn’t be able to subdue it.</p><p>Even if the ghost beast had special methods or was lucky that the Three Days Frozen Calamity would choose to recognize it as its master.</p><p>But how could it master it to such an extent in such a short time?</p><p>“That’s the Three Days Frozen Calamity!”</p><p>Even if the Storyteller didn’t care because the attributes didn’t match, but it didn’t mean that the Three Days Frozen Calamity wasn’t strong.</p><p>Even if the Three Days Frozen Calamity recognized its master, the seal ghost beast could master it freely.</p><p>What he had done before was just to help crack open the space and give it a chance to escape. Then, he would see what kind of life-saving method he had in the chaotic situation.</p><p>“But how did it do it? How could it use the power of the Three Days Frozen Calamity to directly affect the world outside through the broken space?”</p><p>“And to such a serious extent!”</p><p>The Storyteller looked at the snowflakes flying in the sky in disbelief.</p><p>The ice and snow were pressing down inch by inch.</p><p>The darkness was retreating.</p><p>At this time, even if the Night Guardian wanted to resist again.</p><p>While inside the enchantment, he couldn’t seem to suppress the Way of Ice and Snow devouring the darkness.</p><p>This degree of spatial suppression was comparable to the ice bounded domain!</p><p>“You, Red Coat, can’t deal with that ghost beast?”</p><p>The Storyteller turned around and asked in shock.</p><p>The Night Guardian bared his teeth, almost impulsively slapping this fellow’s head away.</p><p>However, he forcefully restrained himself and no longer cared about this perverted man as he couldn’t get anything out of him.</p><p>He gazed around.</p><p>The darkness disappeared and was completely engulfed by ice and snow.</p><p>The Night Guardian knew that he had fallen into a trap!</p><p>First, he used an insignificant amount of frozen power to attack him, causing him to take it lightly and completely letting down his guard.</p><p>Then, when he was distracted, he secretly imprisoned the world and fully concealed it.</p><p>Under such a prerequisite, even if his dark attribute was stronger than the frozen power.</p><p>But what the other party used was not just the power that seeped out from the ancient book!</p><p>It secretly used the wisps of the frozen power as a guide and successfully communicated with the Way of the Heavens.</p><p>When the bounded domain opened.</p><p>At this moment, what was suppressing him was no longer the frozen power in the ancient book, but the ice-type order of the Small World in the White Cave!</p><p>It was the will of the heavens.</p><p>How could humans defeat the heavens?</p><p>The Night Guardian was conceited, but not to the extent where he thought that he could contend against the ice-type order of the entire White Cave space by himself!</p><p>“What a fellow…”</p><p>The Night Guardian shook his head and couldn’t help but exclaim in admiration as he stared at the Storyteller on the ground, who was shivering from the cold and had started to freeze again.</p><p>“I’ve never admired anyone before, but your scheme has indeed amazed me.”</p><p>“You can think of such a far-reaching move just by looking at the weapon prohibition order.”</p><p>“You even managed to communicate with the existence in the ancient book space without me noticing, scheming against me…”</p><p>He gave a thumbs up.</p><p>“Amazing!”</p><p>The Storyteller was stunned.</p><p>What was the Night Guardian talking about?</p><p>He only had so much time trying to make sense of what he was saying before he turned into an ice sculpture again with confusion.</p><p>“Very good!”</p><p>“Such a great plan!”</p><p>The Night Guardian soared into the sky, not daring to touch the ground.</p><p>He bent down and stared deeply at the ancient book on the ground, feeling the broken space around him and sealing this space.</p><p>Since he couldn’t get out, he would wait for someone to come out and fight it out!</p><p>“Reinforcements, right?”</p><p>“Very good, then let this old man see, who exactly are you?!”</p><p>…</p><p>In the ancient book space.</p><p>“Boom Boom Boom –”</p><p>As the sky collapsed and the earth cracked, the hailstones were like falling boulders, smashing down one by one.</p><p>Countless spatial cracks were flying in the ancient book space.</p><p>They were like black lightning.</p><p>One moment they appeared here, and the next moment they appeared in another void.</p><p>The white hailstones were mixed with black spots.</p><p>But even so, the grey mist figure was still holding onto the grey mist umbrella to guard against being smashed.</p><p>The grey mist figure was totally in shock.</p><p>Although Xu Xiaoshou had previously boasted shamelessly that he wanted to collect the Three Days Frozen Calamity.</p><p>But it had never thought that this fellow would just claim it.</p><p>How could he create such a huge commotion?!</p><p>This scene was similar to a divine realm collapsing.</p><p>The grey mist figure was the one who created the seal. It wouldn’t dare to believe that this was something that could be done by a fellow with an Innate cultivation level if it didn’t witness with its own eyes.</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>Aje stood beside the grey mist figure and muttered.</p><p>The two of them, who were playing around with each other in comparison to this disaster scene, had long been forcefully stopped.</p><p>Under the descending storm.</p><p>As long as there was an umbrella, everyone would be good friends.</p><p>Aje rubbed against the umbrella. At this moment, just like the grey mist figure, he was hiding under the Sealing Power to avoid the ice. He stared at the distant iceberg in a daze.</p><p>If he had not seen it with his own eyes.</p><p>This Divine Puppet would not believe that the snow mountain that towered into the clouds was actually Ma Ma’s true body…</p><p>“Darn it, what on earth is your master doing?”</p><p>The grey mist figure could not help but curse, “He didn’t tell you anything?”</p><p>Aje turned his head.</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>At this moment, it was completely speechless from the bottom of its heart.</p><p>In the beginning, everyone was playing happily in the chase game.</p><p>However, when Xu Xiaoshou was keeping silent, everything changed.</p><p>It was as if he had completely taken control of the Three Days Frozen Calamity.</p><p>As this fellow took more time to collect the treasures, the power of the Three Days Frozen Calamity that he could release increased exponentially.</p><p>From light snow to heavy snow…</p><p>From ice graupel to hail…</p><p>To the scene of the apocalypse!</p><p>When the power of the Three Days Frozen Calamity was fully released, even the Heaven and Earth Great Array that was supposed to explode beside him was frozen.</p><p>“The Way of the Heavens’ Energy Movement Order of the Small World have been frozen…”</p><p>The grey mist figure’s face was filled with disbelief.</p><p>However, looking at the scene before him, he had no choice but to believe it.</p><p>When the power of ice and snow spread out, Xu Xiaoshou turned from an ice sculpture into a ball of ice, then into an icicle, and then into an iceberg…</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>Even if the perverted man in the red dress from the outside world was suspected to be interfering with the Heavens and Earth Order of this world, it would be useless.</p><p>With the Way of the Heavens power being interfered with, that fellow couldn’t enter.</p><p>Perhaps, with a forceful charge, he could only enter the spatial fragment directly.</p><p>After all, this was a spatial crack that even the grey mist figure did not dare to meddle!</p><p>“Boom Boom Boom –”</p><p>Hailstones fell from the sky.</p><p>The space could no longer withstand such a force and collapsed one after another.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>The grey mist figure grabbed Aje’s small hand and flew directly towards the direction of the Snow Mountain.</p><p>The most dangerous place was the safest place.</p><p>Even if he did not believe it, he realized it at this moment.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou might really be able to grasp the Three Days Frozen Calamity.</p><p>He held Aje in his hands.</p><p>Only then would it have a chance to follow this fellow out of this collapsed small world and fish in troubled waters, dodging the pursuit of the perverted man in the red dress!</p><p>Aje lowered his head, and a red light flashed in his eyes.</p><p>This action of holding hands…</p><p>If he didn’t comprehend wrongly, it should be a way for these humans to express their goodwill.</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the snow mountain.</p><p>“Ding Ling Ding Ling…”</p><p>“Ding Ling Ding Ling…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were out of focus. His spirit seemed to be accompanied by the joyful sounds of the Three Days Frozen Calamity as he flew outside the ancient book space.</p><p>It was originally just an attempt.</p><p>It was really just an attempt to stir-fry vegetables.</p><p>However, when he truly used the Cooking Expert method to comprehend the Three Days Frozen Calamity, the feedback he received was too surprising!</p><p>The Three Days Frozen Calamity was indeed fire.</p><p>However, it was not the Infernal Heavenly Flames.</p><p>It was not the most overbearing type of flame in the world.</p><p>On the contrary.</p><p>It was very calm and docile.</p><p>And how docile was it?</p><p>Even the Ice Blue White Skeleton, which had been frozen in the snow mountain all year round, had borrowed some of its power when it came out.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was the same.</p><p>When he tried to communicate with this ice flame instead of devouring it.</p><p>The other party’s response was also generous!</p><p>As a fire controller, Xu Xiaoshou’s application of the Three Days Frozen Calamity had also exceeded the expectations of the Three Days Frozen Calamity.</p><p>This human was too powerful!</p><p>All kinds of methods and techniques…</p><p>This was a pleasure that was never experienced from that wooden and slow Ice Blue White Skeleton.</p><p>It was like dry firewood… bah!</p><p>It was like a single man… bah!</p><p>It was like…</p><p>They hit it off at once!</p><p>In short, they complement each other!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could also sense that the Three Days Frozen Calamity was not as overbearing and arrogant as the Infernal Original Seed.</p><p>Even though the Infernal White Skeleton had been waiting by its side for years, it was still unwilling to let the other party hold its hand.</p><p>It was more like it was waiting quietly and patiently.</p><p>Waiting for a suitable host to arrive.</p><p>It did not have any thoughts of concealing itself and flying away.</p><p>The Three Days Frozen Calamity itself was waiting for the fated person to be able to control it well.</p><p>Hence.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou came.</p><p>He sensed the intention of the Three Days Frozen Calamity and knew that this fellow could be persuaded but can’t be forced.</p><p>So with communication, it was completely in his grasp.</p><p>He had swallowed the Infernal Original Seed and taken the famed sword, the Flame Python.</p><p>But there had never been a time when the treasure it wanted come to him voluntarily and not forcibly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was ecstatic.</p><p>He tried his best to release the power of the Three Days Frozen Calamity.</p><p>This was his first time putting theory into practice. With just one attempt, he succeeded.</p><p>He had successfully communicated with the space outside!</p><p>With the help of the ice flame, he could even see the Way of the Heavens clearly — the ice-type order of the White Cave World!</p><p>“Too powerful!”</p><p>With this experience, he didn’t even need to fully unleash the power of the Three Days Frozen Calamity. He only needed to use half of it and Xu Xiaoshou could sense it.</p><p>He didn’t even need to use the Infernal Fire Seed to blow up this space.</p><p>He could even rely on the ice flame in front of him to pass through the spatial fragments and reach the outside world without any injuries!</p><p>There was a way out.</p><p>But before that…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath. The ice crystals that trapped his lips turned into spiritual sources and poured into his energy reserve.</p><p>“Do you want to come with me? The kind that roams the ends of the earth,” he said softly as he looked at the ice flame in front of him that was constantly moving.</p><p>“Ding, Ding, Ding…”</p><p>The Three Days Frozen Calamity was jumping with joy.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou understood.</p><p>But he still had to confirm it.</p><p>“In my energy reserve, there is the Infernal Original Seed that confronted you earlier. You are two extreme existences. If you want to follow me, you have to learn to accept it first.”</p><p>As expected.</p><p>The Three Days Frozen Calamity froze.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was anxious and quickly added, “But it has already decided to follow me. With me around, it won’t act recklessly, and it won’t dare to do anything to you.”</p><p>Eh?</p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, Xu Xiaoshou felt that something was wrong.</p><p>Why, did it have the smell of dregs?</p><p>Fortunately, the Three Days Frozen Calamity did not understand. It only hesitated for a moment before it continued to move its lotus petals rhythmically.</p><p>“Are you sure? Once you agree there’s no turning back.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou asked again and again.</p><p>The Ice Lotus stopped and started to move again.</p><p>“Is that okay?”</p><p>“Ding Ling Ding Ling…”</p><p>Hearing this sound, Xu Xiaoshou’s smile bloomed.</p><p>The Three Days Frozen Calamity did not say anything, but he could hear the other party’s response.</p><p>“Yes.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
