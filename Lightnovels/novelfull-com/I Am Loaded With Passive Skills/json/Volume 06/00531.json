Aje seized this opportunity and subdued her.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, get down here!”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang raised her head and called out unwillingly.</p><p>“What did you say?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stretched his head and held his hands by his ear.</p><p>“Come, down!” Jiao Tangtang roared.</p><p>“The wind is too strong up there. I can’t hear you. Speak louder,” Xu Xiaoshou shouted as well.</p><p>He stood in the eye socket of the Infernal White Skeleton. He was more than a hundred meters above the ground. He felt the warm white flame behind him. Only then did he feel a little safe.</p><p>Go down? That was impossible!</p><p>“Calm down. If we can have a good talk, I’ll tell Aje to let you go.” He continued to shout.</p><p>“I’m very calm!”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang could actually resist.</p><p>However, if she really wanted to break free from Aje’s great strength, she would probably have to transform into a ghost beast form.</p><p>Just as Xu Xiaoshou had said, it was absolutely unwise to expose her ghost beast aura in this meaningless battle.</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>Aje seemed to have sensed something and let go of his foot.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang instantly disappeared.</p><p>“Ascending to the Heavens in A Single Step!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s scalp immediately went numb. He took a step forward and directly went into the eye socket of the Ice Blue White Skeleton.</p><p>As expected.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The eye socket of the Infernal White Skeleton was hit by a whip kick in the next second.</p><p>The skull that was as hard as a rock actually had an additional “Ka ka” sound. In an instant, the crack collapsed.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The White Skeleton, Ember cried out in pain. Its cheekbones swelled up, and in the next second, white flames poured out.</p><p>“Stop, stop fighting!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked by what he saw.</p><p>If they were to really start a war, once everyone’s tempers flared up, it would be very easy for them to lose control of the situation!</p><p>Fortunately, Jiao Tangtang had also learned from Xin Gugu about the power of white flames, so she did not forcefully receive it.</p><p>With a leap of her horse, she dodged Ember’s attack.</p><p>“Calm down.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou used his spiritual senses to stop the three bodyguards from attacking while he tried to persuade Jiao Tangtang.</p><p>“I told you, I’m very calm.” Jiao Tangtang was so angry that her chest was heaving up and down.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself if you call this “calm down”, that would be ridiculous.</p><p>However, this wave of tentative attacks clearly made this woman realize that his three bodyguards were not to be trifled with.</p><p>She did not want to fight anymore.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not want to fight as well!</p><p>“Teleportation… and other skills?” Jiao Tangtang narrowed her eyes and asked.</p><p>“That’s not important.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand and said, “What’s important is that I did not lie to you about what I told you just now. Indeed, I don’t know the whereabouts of the seal ghost beast that you’re looking for.”</p><p>“But the Red Coat Night Guardian and the Saint Servant Storyteller are very likely to have captured it.”</p><p>“Of course, we can’t rule it out… that it managed to escape by itself in the end.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang immediately sneered. “You’ve said all three possibilities. Aren’t you talking nonsense?!”</p><p>“Of course it’s not nonsense.”</p><p>Seeing that she could communicate with him, Xu Xiaoshou heaved a sigh of relief and said, “At the very least, I’ve ruled out these three possibilities for you. You don’t have to search the entire White Cave aimlessly, do you?”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang fell silent.</p><p>Even though it made sense, but she would probably never want to say the word “Yes” in this lifetime.</p><p>“Are you done?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou asked tentatively, “If there’s nothing else, you can go your way, and I’ll go mine?”</p><p>Seeing that the other party did not respond, Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand.</p><p>“Aje, come back.”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A light flashed and Aje instantly appeared by his side.</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang looked at this violent criminal gang and felt a throbbing pain in her head.</p><p>She realized that she was now completely unable to capture Xu Xiaoshou by herself.</p><p>With that teleportation skill, Xu Xiaoshou would be in an invincible position.</p><p>And once she failed to capture this guy first, the three bodyguards behind him would surround her…</p><p>This was no longer a question of whether she could take down Xu Xiaoshou, but the reality of whether she could escape from these three terrifying things!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, give me all the information you know about the Storyteller, and then you can leave.” Jiao Tangtang gave up the idea of forcing Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>There were not many people who could force this guy now.</p><p>“How much information can I know about the Storyteller?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused. “I only found about this person who is the Storyteller part of the Saint Servant after listening to your introduction.”</p><p>“You experienced the battle you mentioned earlier, and you didn’t know anything about it?” She didn’t believe it at all.</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“I told you what I know earlier. There’s no reason to lie to you.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rolled his eyes. Just as he was about to continue ridiculing her, he suddenly thought of something. “Oh right, there’s a detail I can tell you.”</p><p>“Tell me!”</p><p>“It was during that time the seal ghost beast and I were trapped in the Storyteller’s ancient book space. When we came out, the Storyteller was already dispirited.”</p><p>“And the Night Guardian was outside!”</p><p>“It’s not hard to see that the two of them had a battle, and the Storyteller was defeated.”</p><p>“But after hearing what you said…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated. “The Saint Servant, Storyteller shouldn’t be this weak, right?”</p><p>“Impossible.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang shook her head. “If the person you’re talking about is really the Storyteller, no matter what happened, the Red Coat Night Guardian wouldn’t be able to defeat him.”</p><p>“You have to know that this is a huge commotion in the central region. Even the Seven Sword Deity, Gou Wuyue, wasn’t able to capture him in time, and he wasn’t even able to touch the corner of his clothes even after chasing him to the White Cave in the eastern region.”</p><p>“Let alone a Red Coat Night Guardian, even if ten more people came, they wouldn’t be able to defeat him.”</p><p>“That’s strange…” Xu Xiaoshou began to calculate in his heart and said seriously, “But what I saw at that time was that the Storyteller really didn’t have the strength to fight. As for the rest, I’m not too sure.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang also fell silent.</p><p>It could be seen that Xu Xiaoshou was not lying this time.</p><p>“It’s impossible!”</p><p>She still shook her head. “The seal ghost beast should have found the ghost beast host body by now, which is why it was able to hide so well. Other than fighting, it didn’t reveal even a single trace of its aura.”</p><p>“But at the same time, because the cultivation of the ghost beast host body couldn’t keep up, its strength was bound to be limited.”</p><p>“And if the Saint Servant Storyteller is present, then no matter what you see… Everything can only be on the surface.”</p><p>As Jiao Tangtang spoke, her tone became completely certain. “Elder Feng has surely fallen into the hands of the Saint Servant!”</p><p>Whether it’s your Elder Feng or not, it’s still a question… Xu Xiaoshou was ridiculing in his heart, but he didn’t dare say it out loud.</p><p>“Do you have a way to find the Storyteller?” Jiao Tangtang suddenly asked.</p><p>“You’re going to find the Saint Servant?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. “Are you crazy? You can’t even beat me. Are you going to send yourself to death?”</p><p>The corners of her eyes twitched wildly. She almost couldn’t suppress the primal energy in her body again and chose to fight this guy to the death.</p><p>“I have my own way,” she said unhappily.</p><p>“But I have no way.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said helplessly, “I haven’t even touched the Storyteller. From the beginning to the end, that guy was sealed in the ice. I couldn’t even get a piece of his clothes.”</p><p>“If you want to find him, maybe you can only go to the battle scene to find some scent.”</p><p>“If it’s a ghost beast, the nose should…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stopped his mouth in time. Some words were better left unsaid.</p><p>“He’s really useless…” Jiao Tangtang’s head was splitting.</p><p>Useless?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t angry.</p><p>At that time, he hadn’t tamed the two white skeletons yet. It was already good enough that he could escape, and this was called useless?</p><p>Which Innate expert could survive the chaotic battle between the Red Coat and Saint Servant, as well as a ghost beast?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was confident that what he had achieved in this battle was rare in this world.</p><p>Even if the Eighth Sword Deity was reincarnated, it would probably be impossible… even if they were at the same cultivation level!</p><p>Yes, it was impossible!</p><p>I, Xu Xiaoshou, said it!</p><p>“Buzz –”</p><p>While the two of them were silent, the void suddenly trembled.</p><p>In the next moment, the ground also began to shake.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately became alert and turned around to look in a certain direction.</p><p>Almost at the same time, Jiao Tangtang also turned around to look.</p><p>“Om…”</p><p>As if the white bead was broadcasting in his mind, the entire map of the White Cave was spread out.</p><p>On top of it, a certain point of black devilish energy suddenly burst out, instantly enveloping several small light spots around it.</p><p>Although they were light spots, the map of the White Cave was so small, yet there were such obvious traces of black covering it.</p><p>It was imaginable.</p><p>At this moment, the entire White Cave Small World was covered by the devilish energy and it was estimated that it was more than the size of a few Spirit Fusion Swamp.</p><p>“The Fourth Sword?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou exclaimed, “The Fourth Sword is born?”</p><p>“It shouldn’t have been born yet.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang’s eyes were serious as she said, “But from the looks of it, it’s not far from Red Coat breaking the Thirty-Six Heavens Sealed Array.”</p><p>“It hasn’t even been born yet?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>It hadn’t even been born yet, and there was already such a huge commotion?</p><p>From the looks of it, the momentum of the Flame Python when it was born was nothing compared to it.</p><p>“After all, it’s one of the five great chaotic divine instruments of the continent. The Fourth Sword was also known as a vicious sword. This commotion can only be considered as a prelude, and it’s a relatively small one.” Jiao Tangtang sighed.</p><p>“Buzz Buzz Buzz.”</p><p>At this moment, a strange sound suddenly came from within Xu Xiaoshou’s ring.</p><p>He hurriedly sent his spiritual senses in.</p><p>In the next second, a spirit wheel that was vibrating at a high speed flew out.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>After a long time, he finally remembered that this was something that came from the ring of that old man from the Zhang Residence.</p><p>However, at that time, he had checked this ring.</p><p>Most of the wealth inside was visible to the naked eye.</p><p>Only this spirit wheel was completely incomprehensible.</p><p>Now that there was a movement from the Fourth Sword, there was movement from this thing… could it be that it was connected?</p><p>“Tiancheng Spirit Wheel?” Jiao Tangtang exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>“You know it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned his head and looked over. He raised the spirit wheel. The direction that the needle on the plate pointed to was the direction where the Fourth Sword was about to be born.</p><p>“Of course I know it.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang looked at Xu Xiaoshou strangely and said, “They are in the few counties around the White Cave. They are famous for being expensive.”</p><p>“It is said that when the White Cave was opened last time, someone found the Sacrificial Carving. The Tiansheng Spirit Wheel is one of the few spiritual objects that recorded the aura of the Sacrificial Carving.”</p><p>“Through this spirit wheel, once you enter the White Cave, you will be able to lock onto the location of the Sacrificial Carving and eventually find the Fourth Sword.”</p><p>“Of course, these are all first-mover statements.”</p><p>“The thing you are holding now is basically worthless. After all, the location of the Fourth Sword has already been exposed. A large number of Red Coats are surrounding it. Whoever goes will die… this is a trash spirit wheel.” Jiao Tangtang’s gaze was fixed on the spirit wheel.</p><p>“Sacrificial Carving?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not care about the trash spirit wheel that she had mentioned. Instead, he was attracted to this new term.</p><p>He had always been curious about how the two great Sovereigns of the Zhang family had found his position.</p><p>If it was a coincidence, then that was another matter.</p><p>However, the White Cave was so big, so there was no reason for him to meet his mortal enemy every time.</p><p>Therefore, he guessed that the two elders of the Zhang family had found him through this “Tiansheng Spirit Wheel”.</p><p>And the spirit wheel was bound to the aura of the Sacrificial Carving…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly thought of something related to the carving piece that he had.</p><p>It came from the bronze carving piece in the magic box on the top floor of the Hidden Scriptures Pavilion of the Zhang Family!</p><p>“What is the Sacrificial Carving?” he asked.</p><p>“Some of the rust that fell off the body of the Fourth Sword, right?”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang frowned and said, “I’m not too sure either, but it’s said that during the last White Cave opening, someone obtained this carving piece and comprehended the sword intent of the Fourth Sword from it.”</p><p>“And the Fourth Sword was one of the swords of the Eighth Sword Deity in the past. Therefore, the sword intent in it can be said to be the legacy of the Eighth Sword Deity.”</p><p>“At that time, the Sacrificial Carving was sold at an extremely high price. Even the Tiancheng Spirit Wheel was hard to come by. That’s all.” Her gaze continued to stay on the spirit wheel, unable to move.</p><p>“R-r-rust?” Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>He was already certain that the bronze carving piece that could transform him into a Berserk Giant with just one grip was undoubtedly the Sacrificial Carving.</p><p>After all, this carving piece and the spirit wheel were both obtained from the Zhang Residence and could be combined into a set. This explanation made sense.</p><p>But… rust?</p><p>Darn it!</p><p>Was this Fourth Sword really that strong?</p><p>Just the rust on the body of the sword alone could make people despair and go crazy?</p><p>“Are you kidding?” Xu Xiaoshou was in disbelief.</p><p>“Why would I lie to You?”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang glared at him and said, “The Tiancheng Spirit Wheel is useless, but its function is indeed very powerful.”</p><p>“As long as we can find the Sacrificial Carving, with the sword intent on it, if someone can really comprehend it, there is a high chance that he will be recognized by the Fourth Sword and become the sword-bearer of the fierce sword!”</p><p>“This thing of yours…”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang started to feel a little embarrassed. She wanted this spirit wheel.</p><p>After all, the Fourth Sword had yet to be born. As long as she could find the Sacrificial Carving through this spirit plate during this time, she would have more confidence in bringing the Fourth Sword home.</p><p>“I can’t possibly give you the spirit wheel…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou subconsciously rejected it.</p><p>Suddenly, he thought about it. He already had the Sacrificial Carving. It would be useless to take this thing. Why not exchange it for some valuable information?</p><p>“I can give you the spirit wheel, but I have a few questions to ask you!”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang was stunned. She suddenly shook her head, “Impossible. I’ve already said that before signing the Ghost Beast Contract, I won’t reveal anything to you.”</p><p>“It’s not about these questions.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately threw the spirit wheel out and said, “It’s about the Fourth Sword.”</p><p>There was a clatter.</p><p>Jiao Tangtang took the spirit wheel and tightened her grip. “What do you want to know?”</p><p>“Everything!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said seriously, “Everything about the Fourth Sword, the White Cave problem, and the situation outside the White Cave that you mentioned just now.”</p><p>Although he already said that he did not want to take the Fourth Sword.</p><p>But being kept in the dark, at the mercy of others, was what Xu Xiaoshou could not accept.</p><p>At the very least, it is necessary to fully understand how a mere Fourth Sword can provoke a group of big shots who are not even swordsmen.</p><p>Just because the Eighth Sword Deity used to carry a sword?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not believe it.</p><p>“Ha!”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang sneered, “Xu Xiaoshou, you really are asking for too much. You want to exchange information from me for a mere Tiansheng Spirit Wheel?”</p><p>“Shoo!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pulled the spirit wheel in his hand, and the spirit wheel was directly pulled back. “Forget it if you don’t want to talk about it.”</p><p>What ability was this?</p><p>Spider silk?</p><p>“Surprised, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“I’ll tell you!” She was so angry that her teeth were itching.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou threw out the spirit wheel again and shrugged. “With me, you can stop being so arrogant, okay? Be straightforward!”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang put the spirit wheel into her ring and said, “There’s a legend of the Fourth Sword. It’s very simple. It’s the Eighth…”</p><p>“Are you fooling a child?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rolled his eyes. “The Red Coat man wants the Fourth Sword, the Saint Servant wants it, and so do you. Now, the Seven Sword Deity has come to the White Cave</p><p>“It seems that everyone’s primary goal is not the Fourth Sword, but the last common point is that they can take whatever they want</p><p>“So, don’t tell me that everyone is here for the lousy title of the Eighth Sword Deity’s sword</p><p>“These things can attract young swordsmen, but lying to me? Impossible!”</p><p>“White Cave… has a secret!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of the wretched saint who was hiding in an unknown place.</p><p>If the White Cave had some kind of supreme treasure that could be related to the saint realm, there was no doubt about the Fourth Sword!</p><p>Jiao Tangtang’s eyes flashed with surprise.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you are very…”</p><p>“I am very smart. There is no need to talk nonsense. Say something practical!” Xu Xiaoshou interrupted.</p><p>She clenched her fists tightly. She really wanted to turn around and leave at this moment.</p><p>What on earth did this fellow eat to grow up? Was his innate attribute strength a worm in someone else’s stomach?</p><p>“The Fourth Sword…”</p><p>“If you want to say the Fourth Sword or White Cave, then I have to mention a new term…”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang pondered for a long time before she finally decided to speak. “Xu Xiaoshou, do you know the Infernal Hell Sea?”</p><p>“I’ve only heard of ‘Infernal’…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression was calm, but his heart was already beginning to surge.</p><p>As expected, the secret of the White Cave was very explosive!</p><p>He could connect many things with just the beginning of the term.</p><p>White Skeleton, Infernal Heavenly Flames, White Flame…</p><p>How could cultivation resources that were completely compatible with his Infernal Heavens appear in the White Cave?</p><p>This time, the direction seemed to be clear.</p><p>Also, Elder Sang’s mission without any direction, as well as the wretched saint’s ability to burn the sky and boil the sea…</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart palpitated. He did not dare to speculate on his own anymore. He wanted an explanation of the real situation.</p><p>Jiao Tangtang exhaled lightly and said, “The Infernal Hell Sea is a different extradimensional space, but it’s different from the White Cave. Its danger level is almost the highest in the world, and it’s one of the continent’s Seven Breaks.”</p><p>Seven Breaks was another new term…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded and didn’t interrupt Jiao Tangtang’s explanation. His eyes signaled her to continue.</p><p>“Every time the Seven Break’s level extradimensional space opens up, it’s almost a disaster.”</p><p>“And the last time the Infernal Hell Sea appeared was here.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang extended her finger and pointed at the ground. “Or to put it another way, White Cave’s predecessor was the Infernal Hell Sea!”</p><p>As expected… Xu Xiaoshou’s expression turned solemn and he remained silent.</p><p>Jiao Tangtang said, “It’s impossible to train in such a forbidden ground. Just to seal the Infernal Hell Sea, the Holy Divine Palace sacrificed a large number of Red Coats and White-clothed and lost countless experts.”</p><p>“In the end, they successfully sealed it.”</p><p>“But this is only temporary…”</p><p>With a sigh, Jiao Tangtang continued, “The reason why the Seven Breaks is called Seven Breaks is that it has a relapse.”</p><p>“Once the Infernal Hell Sea is completely shut down in the White Cave, it will not disappear.”</p><p>“On the contrary, it will appear in another place next time.”</p><p>“At that time, not only will the location of its appearance be unknown, the danger level will rise.”</p><p>“Therefore, in order not to completely shut down the Infernal Hell Sea, this extradimensional space, the Holy Divine Palace can only choose to seal and weaken it. They can break it, but not all of it…”</p><p>“You can understand such a tortuous process, right?” Jiao Tangtang glanced at the young man who seemed to be very calm.</p><p>“I understand.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded.</p><p>This kind of thing was already very terrifying.</p><p>It couldn’t be completely destroyed, but it had to be sealed…</p><p>This was like trying his best to capture a Sovereign… No, a demi-saint!</p><p>It couldn’t be killed, it could only be captured.</p><p>It was already difficult to capture a Sovereign, let alone a demi-saint?</p><p>One had to grasp this degree well. One could imagine how much effort the Holy Divine Palace had put in.</p><p>Jiao Tangtang continued to explain, “Sealing and weakening is the only way to prevent the Seven Breaks restriction from relapsing</p><p>“The Holy Divine Palace’s method is to suppress it with a treasure of suppressing barrier and reduce the danger level of the Infernal Hell Sea year by year.”</p><p>“Therefore, the Fourth Sword and the Cardinal Wheel were born.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat, and he asked, “Let’s talk about something else. What is the function of the Cardinal Wheel?”</p><p>“That’s even more impressive.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang chuckled, “The Cardinal Wheel that the Hallmaster Dao personally led the Path Division to create is completely compatible with the Way of the Heavens of the Small World of the Infernal Hell Sea.”</p><p>“Through this wheel, the Way of the Heavens can be manipulated to achieve a reduction in the Way of the Heavens…”</p><p>“You don’t understand, right?”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang looked at Xu Xiaoshou’s dumbfounded expression and knew that this fellow’s knowledge reserves were insufficient.</p><p>“To put it another way, it is to carry out a downgrading attack from the world level and then gradually weaken the danger level of the extradimensional space.”</p><p>“It is similar to how the Holy Emperor can control the Way of the Heavens and then suppress the development of the five domains of the Holy Divine Continent so that no one can break through to the demi-saint realm… Do you understand?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face instantly turned as white as paper, and his heart was beating wildly. It was as if it was about to jump out of his chest.</p><p>What kind of crap metaphor was this?</p><p>“Your way of saying it… is very problematic!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou licked his dry lips and said, “Let’s not talk about the White Cave first. Let’s discuss your metaphor.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang immediately burst into laughter.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, aren’t you being too paranoid? It’s just a metaphor.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
