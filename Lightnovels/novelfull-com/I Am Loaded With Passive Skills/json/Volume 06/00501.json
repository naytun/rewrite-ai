No matter what method he used, even if he used his spiritual senses to communicate, there was no response at all.</p><p>“Playing dead, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned.</p><p>He glanced at the Infernal Original Seed whose power was forcibly withdrawn and said angrily, “You could communicate just now, and you could also hear me. What’s going on now?”</p><p>“You picked it up?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>After waiting for a long while, his angry words were like a stone that sank into the ocean, and there was no reply.</p><p>“You’re quite arrogant…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew in his heart that using such a conventional method was destined to be unable to communicate with that unknown fellow.</p><p>His eyes rolled, and his face darkened.</p><p>“Are you crazy? You’re already in my Origin Court. Can’t you see my situation?”</p><p>“I need to use the power of the Infernal Original Seed now. I need to use it, do you understand?!”</p><p>“How can I activate it when the energy is completely sealed? How can I use the energy of this fire seed to combine with the Three Days Frozen Calamity to blow up this small space?”</p><p>He said in exasperation, and his spiritual senses suddenly wrapped around the Infernal Original Seed.</p><p>“Look!”</p><p>“Previously I could still feel a little bit of temperature, but now I can’t do it no matter how hard I try.”</p><p>“So, do you want to find the fire seed by yourself, or do you really want to help me increase my strength so that I can help you again?”</p><p>“If you have such a plan, loosen the seal for me so that I can easily absorb the power inside the fire seed.”</p><p>“In that case, my strength will increase, and I’ll be able to do things for you when I’m out, won’t I?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou used his spiritual senses to conjure a physical body and danced along with the words.</p><p>He did not know if the other party could see everything in the Origin Court, or if he could only hear the sounds.</p><p>However, he had to express his anxiety completely.</p><p>“…”</p><p>There was no response.</p><p>No matter how intense his emotions were this time, the white bead did not have the same reaction as last time.</p><p>Without the Great Path’s chanting, the White Cave map would not appear.</p><p>If the map did not appear, the void rift would not exist either.</p><p>As such…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned and seemed to have understood something.</p><p>“Could it be that only when the white bead called out, then it could sense that I was communicating with it and give a timely response?”</p><p>It was very likely!</p><p>He recalled the previous situation.</p><p>He had communicated with the fire seed and the white bead at the same time, causing the chanting of the Great Path to continue to appear. Only then would there be a response from within the crack.</p><p>The current situation was equivalent to hanging up the phone.</p><p>No matter how intense his emotions were, it couldn’t sense it.</p><p>“That’s still alright…”</p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Xiaoshou’s heart slightly calmed down.</p><p>At least, this guy didn’t just come and go as he pleased.</p><p>There was probably more than one small world between them. Even if the wretched saint wanted to help, he had to pay a price.</p><p>“How’s the situation with the grey mist figure?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou released his spiritual senses and saw the scene on the other side.</p><p>Obviously, without the ice or fire attributes, even if the grey mist figure’s seal attributes were very powerful, it was indeed difficult to collect treasures like the Three Days Frozen Calamity.</p><p>Looking at the sealing mist that was getting thicker and thicker, Xu Xiaoshou guessed that the other party have not even solved the riddle.</p><p>After all, the reason why he was able to keep the Infernal Original Seed in the Origin Court so quickly was because of the special existence of the white bead in his mind.</p><p>“Very good…”</p><p>Knowing that he was already a big step ahead, Xu Xiaoshou was no longer in a hurry.</p><p>After slightly calming his mind down from the shocking reasoning just now, he silently remembered the time.</p><p>Now that the power of the Infernal Original Seed was completely sealed, he could not continue to communicate with the will in the white bead by combining the two.</p><p>But there was another way…</p><p>Ten minutes!</p><p>Every ten minutes, the white bead would wake up.</p><p>If his deduction was correct, then three minutes later, everything could be verified successfully!</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>In the sealed bounded domain, Aje called out softly by his side.</p><p>It did not know what Xu Xiaoshou was doing.</p><p>But this kind of situation where he could stay in a daze for an entire night after completely settling down…</p><p>Aje indicated that it was used to it.</p><p>“Soon!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou monitored the time closely and saw that nothing unexpected had happened in the outside world, so his attention was completely focused on the white bead.</p><p>As expected.</p><p>When the time was up.</p><p>“Om…”</p><p>The voice that cleansed the soul appeared once again.</p><p>At the same time, the small map that covered all the terrain and treasures of the White Cave also appeared.</p><p>He threw away all other distractions.</p><p>When the voice appeared, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes immediately locked onto the crack at the end of the map.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>After shouting, he continued to speak.</p><p>“I’m going to use the power of the Infernal Original Seed now, but you’ve completely sealed off the power of this thing. What’s going on?”</p><p>“If I can’t activate the power of the fire seed, then I can’t blow up this space. If I can’t blow up this space, then that guy outside wants me dead. After I die, your plan will be ruined. No one will run errands for you, do you understand?!”</p><p>“If you understand, then unseal it for me!”</p><p>“Don’t completely unseal it. If you do, I’ll die too. Just a little bit of power, and it’ll be fine as long as it can be used by me?”</p><p>“As for that degree…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly stopped. Looking at the map of the White Cave that disappeared after a single sound, he felt his mouth became dry.</p><p>He uttered the rest of his words weakly.</p><p>“As for that degree, it should be about the same as the Advanced Infernal Fire Seed. Perhaps it can be a little lower than the Infernal Fire Seed.”</p><p>“After all, it won’t be tiring for me to cultivate like this…”</p><p>“Forget it, you can grasp it yourself…”</p><p>He gave up.</p><p>The map of the White Cave was gone. How could the other party still hear it?</p><p>As for whether the first half of the words could be transmitted over…</p><p>“Sigh.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was distressed.</p><p>What the hell was this!</p><p>He had transformed into a physical entity and was roaring in the Purple Mansion Origin Court. If outsiders were to see this, wouldn’t they think that he was a lunatic?</p><p>“Om…”</p><p>Before he could finish mocking himself, Xu Xiaoshou heard the sound that had ended just now ring out once more.</p><p>He looked over in surprise, only to see that the map had once again appeared on the white bead.</p><p>And in the deepest crack, a wave of irresistible power surged out.</p><p>The power transformed into a beam of light that continuously shone on the Infernal Original Seed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had seen a miracle.</p><p>This was… actually useful?</p><p>“Awesome!”</p><p>The beam of light didn’t disappear.</p><p>Soon, Xu Xiaoshou felt that the temperature of his Purple Mansion Origin Court was rising.</p><p>“Aren’t you leaving yet?”</p><p>Under the injection of the beam of light, the milky white fire seed gradually faded away from its dust color and gradually emitted its own luster.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately understood.</p><p>The other party probably didn’t know what temperature he wanted either.</p><p>Therefore, he chose this method of increasing the temperature step by step. As long as he felt the limit, he could stop it at any time?</p><p>“Smart!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou praised loudly, but when he saw the light beam tremble. He immediately became anxious. “Hey, hey, steady, steady!”</p><p>“Chi Chi!”</p><p>His spiritual senses gradually emitted sounds of being unable to bear the burden. Xu Xiaoshou began to feel pain.</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The information bar also began to pop up, but he did not stop immediately.</p><p>If the wretched saint had chosen this method to gradually unseal the power of the Infernal Original Seed, he could have used it as the Advanced Infernal Fire Seed.</p><p>In this way, even if he hadn’t gotten the seed in his Yuan Mansion, he could still cultivate it until it becomes a white flame through the Infernal Original Seed!</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>The temperature was rising rapidly and Xu Xiaoshou felt like he was about to burn up.</p><p>After all, he had seen the White Skeleton’s white flame and Elder Sang’s battle, so he roughly understood the extent of his next step of cultivation.</p><p>Now, no matter how painful it was, he had to endure it.</p><p>“It’s still okay, a little more, just a little more!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gritted his teeth and held on.</p><p>The position where the Infernal Fire Seed appeared was too awkward.</p><p>If it was above the energy reserve, he could use his spiritual source to withstand the pain.</p><p>But now, he was in the Purple Mansion Origin Court. Other than spiritual sense, which had no defense, there was no other way to isolate the temperature.</p><p>“Om…”</p><p>The light beam suddenly became smaller.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>“Don’t, I can still do it. Keep going, keep going!”</p><p>“Ugh!”</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>Hearing the muffled groan, Aje turned around and saw Xu Xiaoshou, who was in a daze out of nowhere. At some point, blood had begun to seep out of his glabella.</p><p>Soon his seven orifices, his neck, and his entire body…</p><p>“Ma Ma?”</p><p>It looked around in a panic.</p><p>But this time, it was the same as before. He did not see any enemies.</p><p>“Ma Ma!”</p><p>Aje turned its head around angrily and suddenly looked in the direction of the grey mist figure.</p><p>Aje tried to lift his leg, but he realized that this time, Xu Xiaoshou did not stop him at all.</p><p>Didn’t this mean that the guy who was emitting the mist was a demon and was hurting its “Ma Ma”?</p><p>“Swoosh!”</p><p>Aje was as fast as lightning, rushing to the other side and forming a big ball of sealing grey mist.</p><p>“Ma ma, Ma Ma!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The Purple Mansion Origin Court seemed to have been hit by a giant hammer. When the temperature reached a certain level, it began to shake violently, and a heavy sound was heard.</p><p>“Xiu!”</p><p>As soon as the sound was heard, the beam of light immediately disappeared.</p><p>“Om…”</p><p>As the last sound fell, the white bead and map disappeared.</p><p>“It’s gone?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou came back to his senses in surprise. Only then did he realize that his spiritual sense had completely shrunk under the high temperature, and had become a mass.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>The intense pain assaulted Xu Xiaoshou, and he gasped.</p><p>However, in the next second, he discovered that even though his spiritual sense had shrunk by more than half, not only did his detection range not decrease, it had even increased by a little?</p><p>Moreover, the image transmitted by the spiritual sense seemed to be much clearer than before?</p><p>“Compressed into essence?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately understood something.</p><p>Although the image in the spiritual sense was not as clear as his Perception.</p><p>However, he seemed to have unintentionally found a way to train his spiritual senses?</p><p>One had to know that apart from the increase in cultivation level, there were no spiritual techniques that focuses on the cultivation of spiritual senses that existed in the entire continent.</p><p>“But this training process is too painful!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt like he was about to faint.</p><p>He glanced at the information pane.</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The speed of the bullet box was still updating every second.</p><p>However, unlike the previous burning of the Infernal Fire Seed, this wave of mental damage was truly agonizing.</p><p>“Hold on, stay still!”</p><p>Forcefully calming his chaotic mental strength, Xu Xiaoshou immediately went to the location of Infernal Original Seed.</p><p>He couldn’t take it anymore.</p><p>Even if this was also a cultivation method.</p><p>However, if the fire seed that had released its temperature was placed in the Purple Mansion Origin Court, he believed that within a day, it would definitely burn Xu Xiaoshou into a fool.</p><p>“I must move it to the energy reserve as soon as possible!”</p><p>The compressed spiritual senses once again attached themselves to the Infernal Original Seed, but the fire seed that had released a portion of its power wasn’t something that a spiritual sense of this level could touch.</p><p>After a “Chi” sound, the spiritual sense was instantly incinerated.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held his head, feeling like he was about to collapse.</p><p>He suddenly thought of the Breathing Technique.</p><p>“Yes, breathe it out first, then breathe it in!”</p><p>He did as he thought.</p><p>With all his attention on the fire seed, Xu Xiaoshou channeled his spiritual senses and exhaled deeply.</p><p>“Weng!”</p><p>The Infernal Fire Seed trembled.</p><p>“There’s hope?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was overjoyed.</p><p>Since it could move, it meant that there was still hope for him!</p><p>“Heh!”</p><p>He continued to exhale.</p><p>The fire seed shook once more, and this time, it seemed to move a little further away.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gritted his teeth and used the Breathing Technique to push the fire seed bit by bit, sending it to the entrance of the Purple Mansion.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>His spiritual sense collided, and the Purple Mansion gate opened wide.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou spat it out with all his might.</p><p>The Infernal Original Seed directly broke through his forehead and was pushed out from between his eyebrows.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>Not daring to relax, Xu Xiaoshou, who was afraid that the fire seed would break the seal once it was out of the white bead’s range of control, saw that after he had sent this thing out of his body, he once again imitated what he had done in the Spirit Palace and suddenly sucked it in.</p><p>“Chi Chi!”</p><p>The fire seed, carrying a scorching temperature, was directly melted through the throat and then sent to the energy reserve and energy center.</p><p>“Darn…”</p><p>The intense pain as if he had swallowed a fire clamp almost sent Xu Xiaoshou on the way to death.</p><p>Fortunately, the plan was successful.</p><p>The Infernal Original Seed was successfully moved to the upper part of the energy reserve.</p><p>The injuries left by the series of actions from just now were rapidly recovering under the effect of the Eternal Vitality.</p><p>“Chi Chi Chi…”</p><p>His body was burnt red as dense steam was released from his pores.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou reckoned that if he did not have Eternal Vitality, he would have died of dehydration under such temperature.</p><p>Fortunately, this time was different from the last time.</p><p>With the energy reserve core that had already turned into the Infernal Spiritual Source as the foundation, the pain was temporary when faced with a higher level power of the same origin.</p><p>In less than a few breaths time, Xu Xiaoshou began to feel the quality of his spiritual source starting to compress and condense!</p><p>Raising his palm and looking at the dense steam on it, Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he had switched to the second gear.</p><p>He began to observe the power of the Infernal Original Seed after a portion of it had been unsealed.</p><p>“The energy intensity is about the same as the Advanced Infernal Fire Seed…”</p><p>“But, it’s a pity.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed.</p><p>He had the Advanced Infernal Fire Seed.</p><p>But if it had the same power, then the one in his Yuan Mansion would be useless.</p><p>If that wretched saint could continue to unseal a bit more power, Xu Xiaoshou indicated that he would be able to withstand it.</p><p>In this way, the one in his Yuan Mansion and the current one would be able to completely link up with his cultivation system. If given enough time, he might even be able to directly cultivate the sacred physique.</p><p>“But there’s no other way…”</p><p>After all, they were in the Purple Mansion Origin Court at that time.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou believed that the wretched saint had also sensed it. If he continued to release the power, Xu Xiaoshou would be burned into a fool by this fire seed.</p><p>“Very good!”</p><p>He looked at the information bar that was jumping up and down.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that until now, he had completely grasped this Infernal Original Seed.</p><p>The next step of his cultivation was nothing more than to find a place to breathe in and out the higher-quality infernal aura after breaking through this space.</p><p>“The Sovereign Physique, White Flame, Dragon Melting Realm… It’s only a matter of time!”</p><p>He clapped his hands in excitement. Xu Xiaoshou could not be bothered with the pain that kept coming from his body.</p><p>It was not like he had never experienced such a situation before.</p><p>He could still hold on under the passive situation at that time. Now that he had taken the initiative to absorb the fire seed into his body, how could he be defeated by a mere pain?</p><p>“Aje, let’s go. Let’s go and deal with that fellow…”</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>“Where’s Aje?”</p><p>Turning his head, Xu Xiaoshou wanted to pat Aje on the shoulder, but he realized that he was gone.</p><p>Very soon, he shifted his attention to the outside world. He heard a continuous “Bang Bang” sound.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned his head immediately and his eyes turned cold when he saw it.</p><p>He saw that on the other side, the grey mist figure, who was supposed to be collecting treasures in peace, had unknowingly ended his collection of treasures. He turned his head and started a physical battle with Aje’s fist.</p><p>“Darn, you’re bullying Aje while I’m not here?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was enraged.</p><p>He knew that the grey mist figure had no good intentions.</p><p>What kind of evil intentions could Aje have?</p><p>As long as he did not give the order, it would definitely protect him even if it died!</p><p>Now that this situation could happen, there was no doubt that the grey mist figure wanted to launch a sneak attack, but Aje found out and forcefully stopped him!</p><p>“Good for you, a fellow who went back on his words. I already said that we would cooperate. What do you mean by this? Are you trying to play tricks on me?” Xu Xiaoshou immediately flew over and angrily rebuked in the air.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>In the distance, the grey mist figure was directly blasted into a cloud of mist by Aje’s punch.</p><p>It suddenly condensed and took form in another space, and only then did it say in exasperation, “Xu Xiaoshou, I’ve already planned to cooperate with you. I didn’t expect that you wouldn’t give up after all!”</p><p>“I knew it, I knew it, you…”</p><p>“Xiu!”</p><p>The sound of rushing wind interrupted the words.</p><p>Aje was like a maggot in the bone, completely not giving the grey mist figure any time to rest.</p><p>After his figure condensed and appeared for less than a breath’s time, he flashed again and smashed down with a fist.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The mist exploded.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused. “Are you courting death? How many times have I told you this? With Aje around, you can’t succeed in your sneak attack.”</p><p>“It would have been better if you had obediently collected your Three Days Frozen Calamity. Why did you have to play such petty tricks with me? Look at what you have done.”</p><p>“You didn’t receive the treasure and even angered Aje. Let’s see what you can do!”</p><p>“I…” The grey mist figure hurriedly took form on the other side. Its lungs were about to explode from anger.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou must have gone crazy!</p><p>My Three Days Frozen Calamity is about to succeed. Why would I need to do this?</p><p>I’m just waiting for the space fragment to take shape and take your corpse along with me to retrieve the treasure. Doesn’t that sound good?</p><p>I don’t have the energy to sneak up on you, a brat with the Sovereign Physique!</p><p>“Xiu!”</p><p>Another sound of wind breaking could be heard.</p><p>Aje seemed to be really angry.</p><p>It was completely used to the combat style of the grey mist figure and had learned from their experience. Before his opponent’s body was formed, he smelled the seal aura and directly threw a punch.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The space exploded!</p><p>The grey mist figure’s body was directly sent flying over a hundred feet away.</p><p>“Pu!”</p><p>It opened its mouth and spat out blood.</p><p>“You, you despicable and shameless person!”</p><p>The grey mist figure clutched its chest, its face completely ashen.</p><p>Because it had absorbed the Three Days Frozen Calamity, at this moment, more than half of its energy reserve’s spiritual source was still in a frozen state.</p><p>Even if its spiritual source could be used.</p><p>The frozen power had slowed down most of its muscles’ reaction speed and it could not keep up with Aje’s unparalleled attack!</p><p>The grey mist figure was so angry that he stomped his feet. “I…”</p><p>“Aje, beat him up!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could also see that this guy’s reaction was not right.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, this guy would not choose to fight with Aje.</p><p>Since this was the case, it meant that for some reason, even if it wanted to sneak attack him, its current state was not optimal!</p><p>Although he did not know why the grey mist figure, who was in a bad state, would do such a thing, it did not prevent Xu Xiaoshou, who was still extremely fearful of this fellow, from directly choosing to add insult to injury at this moment!</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>Upon receiving the affirmative order, the red light in Aje’s eyes became even more intense as he pounced on the grey mist figure like a madman.</p><p>“Darn it…”</p><p>The grey mist figure’s body trembled and he even swore. However, he immediately stopped and chose to turn around and flee.</p><p>“As if I’ll give you the chance to ambush me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou snorted and sneered.</p><p>He wiped away the bloodstains on his body and burned the blood scabs that had already solidified. He glanced at the grey mist figure, who was being chased away by Aje and found that funny.</p><p>“Is this guy crazy? How could he be so unwise and dared to launch a sneak attack…”</p><p>At that time, he trusted Aje, so he dared to place all his attention on the Origin Court. Naturally, Xu Xiaoshou did not know what was happening outside.</p><p>But now, things had already come to this…</p><p>“If you dare to launch a sneak attack, then don’t blame me… hmm, for returning the favor!”</p><p>Nodding slightly, Xu Xiaoshou set his gaze on the Three Days Frozen Calamity.</p><p>The grey mist figure wanted the Infernal Original Seed, and Xu Xiaoshou was also coveting the power of this cold flame as well?</p><p>Since that fellow couldn’t free himself at this moment, then he had the obligation to take down the Three Days Frozen Calamity as well, to create a foundation for the explosion of space and save the three people inside!</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>He thought about it and did it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s body broke through the wind and directly flew to the location of the Three Days Frozen Calamity.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>A heart-wrenching and indignant roar sounded out. The grey mist figure was going crazy. He did his best to roar, “I dare you to touch the Three Days Frozen Calamity!”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned his head to look at the fellow who was being chased away like an old dog. His heart was filled with unpleasantness.</p><p>Only state officials were allowed to set fire to the place, but the people were not allowed to light the lanterns?</p><p>He sneered and raised his chin arrogantly.</p><p>“Why wouldn’t I?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
