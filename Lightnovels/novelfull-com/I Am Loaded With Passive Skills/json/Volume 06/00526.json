Ghost Beast!</p><p>“White flame?”</p><p>Rao Yinyin, who was standing behind Xu Xiaoshou, was completely dumbfounded.</p><p>She had guessed that Xu Xiaoshou had an unknown relationship with Elder Sang, so she had asked for the Sovereign Pill from Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>But if she insisted on saying that they were master and disciple…</p><p>Rao Yinyin didn’t believe it!</p><p>With the Vice Dean’s weird personality.</p><p>As his disciple, he could only be tortured to death. He couldn’t grow up.</p><p>But when Lu Ke’s body was burning with Elder Sang’s signature white lame, Rao Yinyin was completely certain.</p><p>It wasn’t impossible.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was Elder Sang’s disciple!</p><p>If it was just the Infernal Heavenly Flames in the past, then it could be said that Xu Xiaoshou was only one of the Vice Dean’s test subjects.</p><p>However, the power of the white flame was something that only those who had stayed in the Inner Yard for a long time had seen.</p><p>The ability to burn half of the Chuyun Peak in the Tiansang Spirit Palace into a Chuyun Platform with just one glance was not something that anyone was qualified to cultivate.</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Previously, she still had some thoughts in her mind.</p><p>But this time, Rao Yinyin didn’t dare to act rashly.</p><p>The terrifying extent of the Infernal Heavenly Flames was enough to threaten all spiritual cultivators.</p><p>As for white flame, even if one comprehended the path and was enlightened, it was an ability that could directly burn away the Way of the Heavens.</p><p>It didn’t have a fixed direction.</p><p>But if one had to say it.</p><p>Everyone present, be it swordsmen, physique cultivators, or spiritual cultivators… was all targeted by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>This was the extent of white flame’s terror!</p><p>“Withdraw!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stood in the air. Seeing that the entire area was being suppressed, he no longer hesitated. With a wave of his hand, he moved the Path Pattern Initial Stone along with the Divine Array into his Yuan Mansion.</p><p>Such a thing could change if it was delayed.</p><p>Not to mention that there were still people coming here continuously.</p><p>“Pu Pu…”</p><p>“Pu Pu…”</p><p>The strange sound of fire echoed in the silent scene.</p><p>The people on the ground were completely helpless.</p><p>Even if they watched Xu Xiaoshou take the Path Pattern Initial Stone that they had always dreamed of, there was nothing they could do.</p><p>At this moment, the only extravagant wish in their hearts had turned from seeking treasure to hoping that Xu Xiaoshou would not vent his anger on themselves.</p><p>After all, no one in the entire scene could withstand that anger, including Lu Ke!</p><p>“Hiss! Ah –”</p><p>“What the hell Is this thing?!” Lu Ke screamed.</p><p>His scream contained 30% panic, 30% pain, and 994% helplessness.</p><p>He was completely unable to undo the damage caused by Xu Xiaoshou’s white flame!</p><p>And the white flame, which was born from the Infernal Heavenly Flames, had a qualitative leap in its burning speed.</p><p>In the past, even the spiritual source of an Innate would need to burn for half a day before it was completely burned out.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ke could not even last twenty breaths of time, and his energy reserve was almost depleted.</p><p>However, he understood that this method of using spiritual sources to exchange for the time was treating the symptoms but not the root cause.</p><p>Once his energy reserve was empty, the object that white flame was burning would be transferred from the spiritual source to his real body.</p><p>And judging from the temperature…</p><p>In a few seconds, he, Lu Ke, would be gone!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Lu Ke looked up in horror, his eyes full of begging for mercy.</p><p>However, the young man was suffering for his pride.</p><p>Even if he could not hold on any longer, his lips only quivered a few times. He could not utter those begging words at all.</p><p>“Little guy, I have already said that you should not go against me.”</p><p>“Yet you refused to listen. Why?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed helplessly. “It’s not my intention to kill. Moreover, you’re a Red Coat. I had a friendship with the Elder Night Guardian. I really don’t want to see you die tragically.”</p><p>“Then quickly get rid of the flames on my body!” Lu Ke was anxious.</p><p>At this moment, his energy reserve was completely empty.</p><p>Without the spiritual source barrier, once the high-temperature lands, he would not be able to resist since he didn’t have a Master Level Physique, and he didn’t even have an Innate physical body.</p><p>“Freeze!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grabbed with his empty palm and the white flame was being controlled.</p><p>It did not invade Lu Ke’s body, but the remaining heat could slowly roast him.</p><p>An unpleasant smell of burnt meat spread out.</p><p>Lu Ke was stunned and he was puzzled…</p><p>“What are you trying to do?!” He was going crazy.</p><p>This was the so-called life worse than death, or the pain worse than death!</p><p>Lu Ke never thought that one day, he would also become a pile of meat on the grill in the eyes of others.</p><p>He might as well just let himself die with dignity!</p><p>“I won’t kill you.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said slowly, “It’s the same as what you said when you came. I just want to make a deal with you. After all, I’m a businessman.”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Lu Ke broke out in cold sweat and hot sweat, but they evaporated in an instant.</p><p>“What deal?”</p><p>“A very simple deal.”</p><p>Lu Ke clenched his fists for a moment but found that his hand was empty.</p><p>He looked down and saw that in such a short time, even if Xu Xiaoshou controlled the temperature, the flesh on his hand had completely dried up.</p><p>In some places, even his charred bones were exposed.</p><p>“A demon…”</p><p>Everyone’s bodies began to tremble.</p><p>This guy, who wasn’t sure if his name was Tan Ji or Xu Xiaoshou, was simply a demon.</p><p>A true demon that had crawled out of the Abyss!</p><p>Someone was about to be roasted into a dried corpse, yet you were still leisurely saying such nonsense…</p><p>Was this on purpose? He must be doing it on purpose!</p><p>This guy was taking revenge!</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points, +162.”</p><p>Lu Ke felt that his mind was already in a trance.</p><p>At this moment, he had no energy to criticize Xu Xiaoshou’s actions.</p><p>“What simple deal, you, you tell me quickly…”</p><p>“It’s very simple.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pointed at the long sword on his back with a smile.</p><p>This might be the only divine object on Lu Ke’s body that was completely unaffected by the white flame.</p><p>Even under such a high temperature, the Green Scale Ridge did not move nor was it burned at all.</p><p>“You want my sword?”</p><p>Lu Ke felt as if there was ice water pouring down from his brain, and he regained his consciousness for a moment.</p><p>Then, he said furiously, “This is impossible! Even if I, Lu Ke, am burned to death by you, I will not hand over my Green Scale Ridge!”</p><p>“Then you can go to hell.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not hesitate at all. He clenched his fist.</p><p>“PFFT.”</p><p>“Argh –”</p><p>A mask of pain was instantly plastered on Lu Ke’s face. The sound of his wailing was so loud that it made people feel sorry for him.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, this isn’t good, right?”</p><p>Mu Zixi quietly touched the air and stretched out her small hand to poke Xu Xiaoshou’s kidney.</p><p>“After all, he’s the disciple of the Seven Sword Deity. If he were to be burned to death in front of everyone, the situation after that would be out of control.”</p><p>In the Yuan Mansion, she had heard of Yu Zhiwen’s legends about the Ten High Nobles and the Seven Sword Deity.</p><p>Naturally, she also knew that Lu Ke’s background was extraordinary.</p><p>“Dissuaded. Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around and glanced at Lu Ke.</p><p>He knew that even if Mu Zixi lowered her voice and spoke, it wouldn’t be difficult for her to eavesdrop with her spiritual senses based on the other party’s strength.</p><p>However, even under such circumstances, Lu Ke could only hold on bitterly. He didn’t say anything like, “That’s right, my master is the Moonless Sword Deity. You can’t kill me.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but think highly of him.</p><p>It had to be said that this young man was very stubborn.</p><p>Of course, he was also very difficult to deal with.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned and turned around.</p><p>If that was the case, then let’s put on an act!</p><p>Coincidentally, his Junior Sister had also come over. He might as well be a good cop and a bad cop, forcing that guy to submit until he gave in.</p><p>The famed sword appeared in front of him just like that.</p><p>Such a good opportunity was made through a trade.</p><p>Even if a little bit of coercion was used, it was still a trade.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou would not let such an opportunity go to waste.</p><p>He looked at Mu Zixi and frowned. His eyeballs rolled and he gestured a few times before he said in a serious voice.</p><p>“What you said was true, but now I’m also on the Red Coat’s blacklist. He forced me to kill him. If I don’t kill him, I’ll lose my reputation. If I kill him, I can still get a famed sword. Why not?”</p><p>“Moreover, if a dog is desperate, it will jump over the wall!”</p><p>“No matter how big this guy’s background is, I, Tan Ji, have killed many people with great backgrounds.”</p><p>“If they wanted to find me, then so be it. If they want to take revenge, they have to take a queue number and line up obediently!”</p><p>The people below trembled for a moment.</p><p>Lu Ke, who was surrounded by white flames, also trembled. His face was full of despair.</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points, +121.”</p><p>Mu Zixi was obviously stunned.</p><p>She did not understand what Xu Xiaoshou was trying to express with that wink. She also did not understand how her Senior Brother, who was inherently afraid of death, suddenly became so ruthless.</p><p>“If you want to kill him, you can’t do it openly, right?”</p><p>“Oh?” Xu Xiaoshou went along with her words and asked, “Then what do you think?”</p><p>“Hmm…”</p><p>Mu Zixi hesitated for a moment as if she was thinking of a countermeasure.</p><p>After a short while, she pointed at the crowd below and said in a low voice, “We can’t do it secretly now. After all, so many people witnessed you burning him just now.”</p><p>“After Lu Ke died, everyone knew that it was you… Tan Ji who did it.”</p><p>“Then…”</p><p>After a pause, his Junior Sister’s eyes became fierce. “I suggest that we silence all of them to prevent the information from leaking out!”</p><p>Everyone below was stunned.</p><p>What?!</p><p>Where did this little girl come from? You’re here to cause trouble, aren’t you?!</p><p>The group of people who were originally hoping to get lucky all panicked at this moment.</p><p>“Miss, something’s wrong!”</p><p>“We don’t have any grudges against each other. Why are you so heartless?”</p><p>“None of us saw this… hey, wait, why is it getting dark?”</p><p>“Hmm? What’s wrong with you… oh, right, right, why is it getting dark! Darn it, why is it so quiet? Why can’t I hear anything!”</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>The next second, everyone was in an uproar.</p><p>“Darn, it’s true. Did someone cast a spell? I can’t even see anything since just now. Even my spiritual senses are blocked. This, this, this…”</p><p>“Help, someone, help me. I can’t hear anything!”</p><p>“Darn it, why are you shouting so loudly? My ears are going deaf. No, I can’t hear anything either. Get lost if you want to shout.”</p><p>“I’m blind, I’m blind. Where’s my eyeball? I can’t even feel my eyeball!”</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Sought Help, Passive Points, +86.”</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points, +155.”</p><p>The scene completely lost control.</p><p>All kinds of wails and shouts rose and fell. Even Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>What the heck… what a bunch of actors!</p><p>But, Mu Zixi, what’s wrong with you?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at his Junior Sister in disbelief.</p><p>I called you here to play the good cop, so how did you suddenly become so fierce and evil?</p><p>As expected, you’re the real black-bellied demon king, right? I, Xu Xiaoshou, didn’t even have the intention to destroy the entire scene…</p><p>“Xu, Xiao, Shou!”</p><p>“Called, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>A voice that seemed to have been roasted completely sounded behind him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart palpitated, and he suddenly looked back.</p><p>He saw that Lu Ke, who was burning in white flames, had unknowingly started to exude wisps of black mist from his body.</p><p>Once the cold black mist appeared, even the temperature of the air seemed to have dropped somewhat.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, do you really think that I can’t do anything?”</p><p>Lu Ke’s face was completely twisted.</p><p>Pain, resistance, dissatisfaction…</p><p>All kinds of emotions appeared as if the devil in his heart was about to be released, had begun to release his evil power.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils suddenly shrank.</p><p>He could actually feel the ultimate yin power in Lu Ke’s body that he could only feel from the host body of the ghost beast.</p><p>However, how was this possible?</p><p>His mind was in a mess.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought that his eyes were playing tricks on him.</p><p>However, when his Perception was completely focused on Lu Ke’s body, he realized that this was the truth!</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>He exclaimed in his heart, but Xu Xiaoshou did not believe it at all.</p><p>Who was Lu Ke?</p><p>He was a Red Coat!</p><p>He was one of the Seven Sword Deities — the disciple of the Moonless Sword Deity!</p><p>As a Red Coat and a White-clothed man, how could he collude with the ghost beasts?</p><p>Furthermore, look at the increasingly eerie black mist.</p><p>This fellow had definitely touched more than the edges.</p><p>He was definitely a ghost beast host body!</p><p>“But, something’s not right…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts were numb.</p><p>At this moment, all kinds of strange emotions surged into his mind.</p><p>Red Coat, ghost beast?</p><p>Extermination, experimental subject?</p><p>Seven Sword Deity, White-clothed, the Holy Divine Palace, and…</p><p>Justice, evil?</p><p>“What the hell is this?!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was confused.</p><p>At this moment, his mind was really in a panic.</p><p>What he panicked about was not the power of the ghost beast that suddenly burst out from Lu Ke’s body.</p><p>It was the fear of doubting the Holy Divine Palace’s usual righteous style because of the unknown.</p><p>It was also a fear of the fact that the Red Coat organization, which had always claimed to be righteous and tried to carry out a genocide against the ghost beasts, was hiding a ghost beast host body that was impossible to be undetected.</p><p>Lu Ke… was a ghost beast host body?</p><p>This was impossible!</p><p>But now, such an impossible thing had appeared in front of his eyes.</p><p>How could he not believe it?</p><p>Perception surveyed the entire scene. Everyone was also surprised by the unknown power that appeared on Lu Ke’s body.</p><p>But looking at their expressions, Xu Xiaoshou could tell.</p><p>Each one of them definitely did not recognize the so-called ghost beast power.</p><p>Even the words “ghost beast host body”, they should have only read about it in books.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou was different!</p><p>He had dealt with this thing countless times. How could he not know how to deal with it?</p><p>“This is muddy water. If I get involved, I might die!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had discovered some unspeakable secret.</p><p>He also wanted to think that it was a coincidence.</p><p>But… was it possible?</p><p>It was still possible for another Red Coat person to come.</p><p>But a person like Lu Ke who had a big background had become the host body of a ghost beast. Could this be a coincidence?</p><p>This was definitely a huge secret!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou understood that if he continued to dig into this secret, it might be a consequence that he could not bear at all.</p><p>No, it was not possible but it would be inevitable!</p><p>“AH –”</p><p>A heart-wrenching roar interrupted Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts that had been rolled up into a ball of hemp. He suddenly came back to his senses.</p><p>After the black mist rose, Lu Ke’s back seemed to have opened up an invisible giant mouth.</p><p>The terrifying white flame was swallowed by the single mouth and completely disappeared.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>After doing all this, Lu Ke raised his eyes.</p><p>The pair of scarlet eyes pierced through the void like a sharp sword and pierced into Xu Xiaoshou’s mind.</p><p>“Ghost beast!”</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou was completely certain.</p><p>Just based on this pair of iconic red eyes, Lu Ke, the ghost beast host body was real!</p><p>“Brother, calm down.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pulled Mu Zixi and took a step back.</p><p>Mu Zixi was stunned. “Xu Xiaoshou, you…”</p><p>“Don’t speak, the situation isn’t right.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou interrupted his Junior Sister’s question. He didn’t have time to explain at this moment.</p><p>According to the previous situation.</p><p>If Lu Ke released the ghost beast in his body, then with his current strength, he would definitely not be able to withstand it.</p><p>The last time he narrowly escaped death, it was because the Night Guardian came to clean up the mess.</p><p>The ghost beast was not something that ordinary people could afford to play with.</p><p>They start at the Sovereign Stage, but the top was not capped.</p><p>Who could withstand it?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Lu Ke muttered unconsciously. His white bones clenched his fists tightly, but his eyes were tightly shut as if he was fighting against something.</p><p>“Calm down.”</p><p>“Calm down!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou retreated again. He did not have time to think and grabbed Yu Zhiwen’s wrist with another hand.</p><p>“Will you use the teleportation portal? Get ready, use it to save yourself if necessary!”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen did not reply.</p><p>Just as Xu Xiaoshou was about to continue asking, he suddenly saw the girl’s expression with his Perception.</p><p>She was very worried.</p><p>But, other than worry in Yu Zhiwen’s eyes, no other special emotions could be seen.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart sank to the bottom of the valley.</p><p>This doesn’t make sense!</p><p>As the… Holy Maiden of the Holy Divine Palace?</p><p>Let’s treat her as a Holy Maiden or something like that!</p><p>It was impossible for Yu Zhiwen to not have heard of the existence of the ghost beast like those ignorant fellows who came out from the corners.</p><p>She had even seen the ghost beast when the Flame Python was born!</p><p>Under such circumstances, shouldn’t her first reaction to the ghost beast’s aura from a Red Coat person be shock and disbelief?</p><p>Worry? What was that about!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quivered and unconsciously let go of Yu Zhiwen’s hand.</p><p>This girl definitely knew something!</p><p>In fact, not only did she know, it couldn’t be that she…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou dragged Mu Zixi and took a few steps back.</p><p>At this moment, he completely felt the malice of this world towards these ignorant commoners.</p><p>Perhaps, everyone knew about this kind of information in the upper buildings?</p><p>But… why was it completely different from the information about the ghost beasts that spread out in the world?</p><p>The way the Red Coats acted, the existence of the Holy Divine Palace, the plight of the ghost beasts…</p><p>Was everything as simple as he knew?</p><p>Elder Sang’s face inexplicably appeared in Xu Xiaoshou’s mind.</p><p>Under the completely dark background, the withered old man with the straw hat on his head suddenly became so tall and profound.</p><p>“Before you have absolute power, be serious and be a good chess piece!”</p><p>He spoke slowly again, and the content was the same as before.</p><p>But the meaning in Xu Xiaoshou’s ears changed completely.</p><p>“Chess piece, chess master?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that perhaps he had to find a breakthrough. Elder Sang should be the one who knew the inside story the most.</p><p>After all, almost every word that the old man had said in the past was proof of the truth of the real world that Xu Xiaoshou had discovered!</p><p>“So… what’s the situation?”</p><p>Turning his head, Xu Xiaoshou asked Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen hesitated for a moment and said, “What you saw.”</p><p>“What I saw, and what I know…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head, unable to continue.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen fell silent.</p><p>“What do you know?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held his Junior Sister’s hand tightly.</p><p>If possible, he hoped that he could get an explanation from Yu Zhiwen, and not find Elder Sang to verify something as a posterity.</p><p>Moreover, he still had a little extravagant hope in his heart.</p><p>This experience of sharing life and death together could be considered a beautiful memory. Was it worthy for Yu Zhiwen to tell him everything that he wanted to know?</p><p>On the side, Mu Zixi was in so much pain that she wanted to cry out.</p><p>However, she realized that the atmosphere was not right and forcefully suppressed her cries of pain.</p><p>Her gaze moved back and forth between the two people in front of her, and her small mouth pouted.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>After waiting for a short while, Yu Zhiwen still did not say anything.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou understood and he closed his eyes deeply.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Without much hesitation, seeing that Lu Ke seemed to be unable to suppress his own strength, Xu Xiaoshou picked up Mu Zixi and turned around to leave.</p><p>At this moment, the only person he could catch was his silly Junior Sister.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen… forget it.</p><p>Some beautiful memories were destined to end with a word, pity.</p><p>“If you don’t want to die, run away quickly!”</p><p>After throwing these words from afar, Xu Xiaoshou, who had regained all of his imposing manners, released everyone from their imprisonment.</p><p>The only thing he left behind was a black shadow that was thrown down from the sky.</p><p>He had promised others that even if he could not do it in the end, he would do his best.</p><p>“Pa da.”</p><p>The black shadow fell from his palm. Yu Zhiwen reached out to grab it, and her eyes immediately dimmed.</p><p>The Black Scabbard!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>She looked at the back of the young man who had fled into the distance and muttered, her eyes filled with a complicated look.</p><p>Not long ago, she had indeed wanted this scabbard of the Fourth Sword and had chosen to form a team with him.</p><p>But now… she had clearly obtained the scabbard.</p><p>Why couldn’t she feel the slightest bit of happiness in her heart?</p><p>“AH –”</p><p>A painful cry interrupted everyone’s thoughts.</p><p>The people underground who had obtained their freedom, including the people from the Spirit Palace, also felt that the atmosphere was not right and began to scatter.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>“Run! The Demon King is gone. The crisis is over.”</p><p>“But, what’s wrong with Lu Ke? Why do I feel…”</p><p>“Who cares about his feelings? He looks like he’s going mad. With a famed sword, will you be able to withstand it?”</p><p>“Hmm, that’s true.”</p><p>The people from the Heaven and Earth phenomenon gathered together and flew away separately.</p><p>In this space, only Yu Zhiwen and Lu Ke were left.</p><p>“Xiao Ke…”</p><p>“Did you see that?”</p><p>Fu Xing asked softly among the two figures flying far away.</p><p>Fu Yinhong was confused and said, “What happened? Why did Xu Xiaoshou suddenly give up on the famed sword? He…”</p><p>“Ghost beast!”</p><p>Two words interrupted Fu Yinhong’s words.</p><p>She was stunned for a moment and raised her eyebrows. “You mean that Lu Ke?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Impossible!” Fu Yinhong seemed to be frightened and cried out, “He, he is not a Red Coat?”</p><p>“Yes…”</p><p>Fu Xing sighed softly and recalled his father’s repeated exhortations and exhortations in the study that night.</p><p>If he didn’t know a little bit of the inside story, his father wouldn’t have kept the information about Xu Xiaoshou being suspected of being a ghost beast from the Night Guardian in Red Coat a secret?</p><p>“You don’t have to think about anything. You just need to remember one thing.”</p><p>Fu Xing came back to his senses and said solemnly, “In the future, stay far away from anything related to the ghost beast!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
