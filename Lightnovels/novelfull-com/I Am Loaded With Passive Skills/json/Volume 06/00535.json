We’ll take care of this place. Why don’t you go back and recuperate?”</p><p>The base of the original red-robed was now occupied by a group of white-robed.</p><p>Everyone had their own duties and handled the matter in an orderly manner.</p><p>However, when a middle-aged man in a light blue robe walked out of the tent, everyone immediately fell silent and stood up.</p><p>The white-robed guard at the side hurriedly advised them.</p><p>Gou Wuyue only waved her hand lightly. “The injuries aren’t a problem. How are your preparations going?”</p><p>“All the work has been completed. We’re just waiting for the people in the white hole space to come out.”</p><p>The white-robed guard standing by the side said, “Also, the other injured brothers in Azure Dragon Prefecture have been treated. The others who died in battle have also been notified. Their families have helped take care of them.”</p><p>“Well done.”</p><p>Gou Wuyue nodded. Seeing that almost half of the people in the tent were gone, he couldn’t help but ask softly, “Is there any new information?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>The white-robed guard said, “According to the information that Red Robed left earlier, the storyteller was not the only Saint Servant who entered the Small World of White Cave.”</p><p>“Before this, they actually discovered a total of three figures. They were the Chief Saint Servant, Cen Qiaofu, and the storyteller.”</p><p>“In other words, there are at least three ‘Saint Servant’ in White Cave right now.”</p><p>Gou Wuyue was stunned. “Chief Saint Servant?”</p><p>“Yes.” White-robed nodded.</p><p>“He’s here too?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Gou Wuyue immediately lowered her head, as if she was thinking about something. After a long while, she raised her head and asked, “Where’s Xiao Yi?”</p><p>“Here.”</p><p>The void suddenly flashed, and another white-robed Chang Yi appeared.</p><p>“Who is the person in charge of the branch of the Holy Divine Palace in the Dongtianwang City?” Gou Wuyue asked.</p><p>“Jiang Bianyan,” answered Chang Yi.</p><p>“Jiang Bianyan? I think I remember it…” Gou Wuyue frowned.</p><p>Chang Yi immediately said, “Jiang Bianyan. He is at the peak of the throne realm, and he has been trying to sever the Dao. As for whether he succeeded or not, we don’t know yet.”</p><p>“He has some relationship with the Chief of the Spirit Division, Yu Lingdi. He seems to be a distant relative. He has a healthy root and is definitely not a problem.”</p><p>Gou Wuyue then took out a token and handed it over. “Pass down my orders. Transfer all the white and red robed that can be transferred to the Dongtianwang City and its vicinity.”</p><p>“All of them?”</p><p>Chang Yi was stunned.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Gou Wuyue said, “There are three people who have entered the White Cave. You have already told us this important information very late.”</p><p>Chang Yi immediately bowed in panic. “We are afraid of disturbing senior’s treatment…”</p><p>“We didn’t mean to blame you.”</p><p>Gou Wuyue stretched out her hand and patted his shoulder. She smiled warmly and continued, “Now, the three Saint Servants have already entered the White Cave, and even the Chief Monk is no exception.”</p><p>“You dare say that they don’t have anyone to contact outside?”</p><p>“This can be seen from the person who attacked us earlier. Not only do they have people outside, but their reinforcements are also very powerful.”</p><p>“At that time, if I am delayed any longer, the ones who will suffer heavy casualties will be you guys.”</p><p>“And…”</p><p>Gou Wuyue looked around and said, “Currently, there is a serious shortage of manpower in the vicinity of White Cave, and they lack the best combat strength.”</p><p>“You guys can’t hold on to the banner, so you can only call more people over.”</p><p>“Yes.” Chang Yi nodded in shame.</p><p>“Also, has Yu Lingdi arrived yet?”</p><p>“Not yet, not yet.”</p><p>“Tell him not to come over for now.”</p><p>Gou Wuyue gazed into the distance and said, “Tell him to turn back first and go to Dao Qiongcang to borrow ‘Demon Chief’ first. If he can’t borrow it, then tell him to bring all six of his troops over!”</p><p>“Six Troops?”</p><p>The white-robed people at the side all raised their heads in shock.</p><p>Gou Wuyue gave a faint smile. “This battle is of utmost importance. It’s not as simple as you think. Be prepared to die.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Everyone shouted in unison.</p><p>“And…”</p><p>Confusion flashed across Gou Wuyue’s eyes. “Have you found out the identity of the last person who appeared in Azure Dragon Prefecture?”</p><p>Chang Yi’s body trembled. “Not yet, not yet…”</p><p>“How much have you found out?”</p><p>“There’s not much information available at the moment. After all, when that person appeared, he only used the ‘Great Buddha Chop’, and it was used to save people.”</p><p>“However, from the sword intent aura that leaked out of his body, as well as the habits of his moves, cultivation, and even his facial features…”</p><p>Chang Yi raised his eyes hesitantly and saw Gou Wuyue’s indifferent expression.</p><p>“The Eighth Sword Immortal?” Gou Wuyue asked.</p><p>“Yes.” Chang Yi weakly replied.</p><p>“Little Yi, how many years have you been following me?” Gou Wuyue sighed.</p><p>Chang Yi’s legs went soft.</p><p>“Ten, thirteen years?”</p><p>“Elder!”</p><p>“Elder Wuyue, I also know that it might not be so, but from those characteristics…”</p><p>Gou Wuyue interrupted, “Characteristics? If the Eighth Sword Immortal hasn’t fallen and has reappeared this time, do you think that he would reveal so many obvious characteristics for the sacred divine hall to see?”</p><p>“Uh…” Chang Yi choked.</p><p>“He isn’t the Eighth Sword Immortal,” Gou Wuyue said with certainty.</p><p>“Hum!”</p><p>A sword chime suddenly rang out from within the tent.</p><p>When the sword chime rang out, the curtains on the windowsill fluttered, and sword qi spread out in all directions.</p><p>Everyone was shocked by what they saw, and they all knew that it was the “The Voice of Nulan” inside that had heard the ripples caused by the conversation of the Outsiders.</p><p>After all, the previous owner of this famous sword was the Eighth Sword Immortal!</p><p>“But…” Chang Yi was still a little hesitant.</p><p>“No buts.”</p><p>Gou Wuyue waved his hand, and the famous sword, the voice of the slave mist, flew over.</p><p>He gently stroked the famous sword with one hand, his eyes filled with reminiscence.</p><p>After a long while, he couldn’t help but laugh.</p><p>“Xiao Yi, do you think that your judgment is right, or my feeling is wrong?”</p><p>“This…” Chang Yi carefully raised his eyes.</p><p>Gou Wuyue said helplessly, “You haven’t fought against the Bazhun’an, so you naturally don’t know how arrogant that person is.”</p><p>“If he had really come that day, let alone you guys, even I don’t know if I would have made it here.”</p><p>He pointed at the ground in the eight temples. His voice was very soft, and his tone was extremely grave.</p><p>“Bazhun’an, only fight, not retreat!”</p><p>With a bang, Chang Yi’s mind went blank.</p><p>Only now did he fully realize that they were indeed making deductions based on the so-called “Facts.”.</p><p>But the person standing in front of him was someone who had fought the Eighth Sword Immortal in the battle for the seat of the Ten Masters!</p><p>Such an existence, even if he had not fought with that sloppy man that day.</p><p>With just a glance, he could probably determine the other party’s identity.</p><p>No matter how real their deductions were, what was the point?</p><p>“Understood. We’ll go and overthrow the redo now,” Chang Yi said with a bow.</p><p>“There’s no need to redo it.”</p><p>“Sword cognition, Great Buddha Chop, eight fingers, neck scar…”</p><p>Gou Wuyue muttered.</p><p>In this world, how many people could impersonate the Eighth Sword Immortal to such an extent?</p><p>He raised his voice and raised his hand. “Send someone to the ‘Fringe Moon Immortal City’ and the ‘Burial Sword Tomb’ to take a look. If any of the leaders of these two houses aren’t here, just confiscate them!”</p><p>“Hum –”</p><p>The ‘Voice of Nulan’ shook.</p><p>The sword chimes sounded melodiously and the ground shook.</p><p>Everyone felt a chill in their hearts. Feeling the extremely cold killing intent in the air, they couldn’t help but lower their heads.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>..</p><p>White Cave.</p><p>Not far from the sword grassland.</p><p>“Disciple, do you think I look like this?”</p><p>An old and withered voice that sounded like someone who had not drunk water for ten thousand years appeared.</p><p>“I don’t.”</p><p>Mu Zixi frowned. She looked at the skinny old man in front of her and said, “He won’t say ‘I’. You have to say ‘this old man’!”</p><p>“Oh oh.”</p><p>“He won’t say ‘Oh oh’ either. Xu Xiaoshou, can you be a little more flamboyant and have a bad temper?”</p><p>Mu Zixi said angrily, “Is he as gentle as you?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pressed the straw hat on her head and couldn’t help but retort, “Oh, now you know that I’m gentle? Did you not compare yourself with that old fellow before? Do you still dare to curse me?”</p><p>“Cursed, passive value, + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>“Crap!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sprinkled a few more sticks of withered grass on his clothes and said in a deep voice, “Now, do you look like one?”</p><p>“Raise your head,” Mu Zixi said unhappily.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his head.</p><p>“Dark circles, can you be a little heavier? It’s not right for you to be like this. It’s obvious that you’ve only lasted for a year and a half without the effect of ten years of dark circles!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: “…”</p><p>“Fine, a year and a half and ten years of dark circles, you can still tell them apart?”</p><p>With a thought, the dark circles in his eyes intensified.</p><p>“Yes, yes, there’s that smell. Don’t laugh!” Mu Zixi jumped up and lifted the straw hat of the old man.</p><p>“Oh, right, hair.”</p><p>She seemed to have thought of something. “Hair isn’t that thick and sparse. After all, you’re someone who often stays up late. You’ll definitely lose a lot of hair!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: “…”</p><p>Speaking of which, did Spiritual Cultivators also lose their hair?</p><p>He continued to fine-tune the details.</p><p>To tell the truth.</p><p>If it wasn’t for Mu Zixi, he would have felt that his current image was already 120% similar to that of old sang.</p><p>However, this girl had managed to find out 880% of his flaws.</p><p>As expected, there were thousands of people and thousands of faces. It turned out that in the little junior sister’s heart, Elder Sang’s image was even more unbearable!</p><p>“Is that enough?” He asked.</p><p>“Silly, is master an old man who would ask such questions?”</p><p>Mu Zixi grabbed her twin ponytails angrily and commented, “Xu Xiaoshou, you must always remember that you are pretending to be your master. There is no problem with your image.”</p><p>“But temperament is the most important thing!”</p><p>“Your current temperament doesn’t look like it at all. If you meet an acquaintance, you might be caught on the spot.”</p><p>“Hehe.” Xu Xiaoshou sneered. “That’s because I haven’t started acting in front of you.”</p><p>“Pa!”</p><p>Mu Zixi jumped up and smashed her senior brother’s head in anger. She said, “It’s not ‘hehe’, it’s ‘Hehe.’ It’s a very cheap and cheap kind of smile. The kind that makes people panic when they hear it… a lewd smile?”</p><p>“Great!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was immediately shocked. He pointed at his junior. “Lewd smile? You’re finished. I’m going to tell that damned old man!”</p><p>“UH…”</p><p>Mu Zixi was stunned. She said angrily, “Xu Xiaoshou, I’m teaching you now. Do you still want me to teach you?”</p><p>“Hehe, I’ll let you go. Remember, there won’t be a next time!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou bent over and covered his head with a straw hat. Then, he pinched his junior sister’s chin. There was a meaningful lecherous smile in his eyes.</p><p>Mu Zixi’s face turned red. “Yes, that’s the smell. Do It again.”</p><p>“Hehe, I’ll let you go…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s hand that had just been released pinched her junior sister’s chin again. “Remember, there won’t be a next time.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>“Very good!”</p><p>“Don’t put your hand down. Do It again.” Mu Zixi’s earlobes were red.</p><p>“Hehe, I’ll let you go…”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou said this, she suddenly felt that something was wrong. She patted her junior sister’s head. “Little girl, what are you thinking about!”</p><p>“Aiyo.”</p><p>Mu Zixi retracted her head in pain. The redness was gone and her face had turned pale.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, where did you learn the ‘Disguise Technique’? Why don’t I see you use anything to disguise it?” She asked after a long while.</p><p>“If I can let you see it, wouldn’t I have learned the ‘Disguise Technique’ for nothing?” Xu Xiaoshou sneered.</p><p>“Old Man!”</p><p>“Oh, OH, Old Man… wouldn’t I have learned this ‘Disguise Technique’ for nothing?”</p><p>“Humph.”</p><p>“Cursed, passive value, + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, where are we going now?”</p><p>As Mu Zixi said this, she affectionately hooked her arm around the old man’s arm.</p><p>“Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?”</p><p>“I’m your master now. Don’t call me by my name, or else you’ll be exposed!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly pulled his hand away. “Also, are you and I, master and disciple, that close?”</p><p>“That’s right!”</p><p>Mu Zixi said matter-of-factly, “Xu Xiaoshou, you rarely see the interaction between me and my master. You don’t know that our relationship is already very close.”</p><p>“He often carries me around on his back. You can try it now.”</p><p>After she said that, she was about to jump up.</p><p>“I’m so beautiful, why would i carry you around on my back?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately kicked him.</p><p>“Ouch.”</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Mu Zixi directly hit a wooden stake and stood up in pain.</p><p>“Cursed, passive value, + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>“I’m warning you, don’t mess around!” Xu Xiaoshou said seriously.</p><p>“Cursed, passive value, + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>“You too!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took off the straw hat on his head and said, “Don’t drop the ball at the critical moment, understand? If you encounter any more threats, shrink back. You won’t have to leave Abrogated Origin Residence for the rest of your life, understand?”</p><p>“Tut Tut.”</p><p>The straw hat shrank twice and flew to Xu Xiaoshou’s head to put it on in fear.</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>“Where are we going? Where are we going?” Mu Zixi ran over again and held Xu Xiaoshou’s arm.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou struggled for a while. After thinking about it, he decided to let her go.</p><p>“Let’s go look for ‘Fourth Sword’.”</p><p>Originally, his goal was not ‘Fourth Sword’, but that strange spatial crack.</p><p>However, once he left Abrogated Origin Residence, the crack at the end of the White Cave map in his mind stopped calling out.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that something was wrong.</p><p>He did not dare to act rashly.</p><p>Perhaps the red-robed man had already found the place.</p><p>If that was the case, wouldn’t he be courting death if he went there now?</p><p>Therefore, his target changed.</p><p>There was Fourth Sword!</p><p>The letter Elder Sang had written to him at that time was not bad.</p><p>It didn’t matter if he had the “Fourth Sword” or not. At the very least, it couldn’t fall into the hands of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>“Close your eyes.”</p><p>“HMM?” Mu Zixi raised her eyes. She didn’t know what Xu Xiaoshou was talking about.</p><p>“Close your eyes.”</p><p>“OH.” She obeyed and closed her eyes.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou brushed her eyes and put straw hat and the little girl into her Abrogated Origin Residence. Then, he took a step forward.</p><p>“Open your eyes.”</p><p>“OH.”</p><p>Mu Zixi opened her eyes and her pupils instantly contracted.</p><p>The space in front of her had completely changed.</p><p>The abandoned forest had become a vast grassland.</p><p>Moreover, in the distance of the weeds in front of her, a group of people in red clothes were trying their best to guard the formation.</p><p>Within the formation, there was a monstrous murderous aura that raged for miles.</p><p>In the center of the sky, there was a black sword floating.</p><p>Mu Zixi was dazed.</p><p>“This is… The Fourth Sword?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
