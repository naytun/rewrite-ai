His voice was trembling as if he had been electrocuted.</p><p>“Questioned, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held the straw hat on his head and was about to say something.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou? !”</p><p>The Night Guardian’s voice suddenly became louder. He stretched his chin and his neck leaned forward.</p><p>“Questioned. Passive points + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was silent for a moment.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou! ! !”</p><p>The Night Guardian shouted, as if his worldview had exploded. At this moment, other than roaring, he couldn’t do anything else.</p><p>He trembled and unconsciously stretched out his fingers, shaking up and down.</p><p>His entire body was trembling from shock, trembling from shock, and staggering..</p><p>He was clearly an expert at the level of the Cutting Path.</p><p>But now, even when he stepped into the Void, the Night Guardian felt that his footsteps were weak and his body was completely unstable.</p><p>“You are Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“How can you be Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>At this moment, the Night Guardian was really going crazy.</p><p>In his mind, in the ancient book’s space, the actions and words of the “Second Brother of the Saint Servant” were replayed, one scene after another, and then replayed.</p><p>However, the more replayed the scene, the stronger the impact.</p><p>The words and actions of the so-called ‘Second Brother of the Saint Servant’ were once again fiercely impacting the soul of the Night Guardian.</p><p>His mind was blank. The lips of the Night Guardian opened and closed, unable to say a single word.</p><p>“You’ve mistaken me for someone else.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou understood in his heart that his subconscious response had already responded to everything.</p><p>At this moment, he only hated himself for being so lucky to have survived the disaster so quickly. Why couldn’t he run a few more steps after swallowing the elixirs.</p><p>Why did the Night Guardian rush over… So quickly!</p><p>He clearly had “Stealth” and “Transformation”. There was no reason for the Night Guardian to be able to sense his aura!</p><p>“How did you find me?” Xu Xiaoshou held onto the straw hat and straightened his expression.</p><p>He was not a person who would give up easily.</p><p>If he could use his mouth to deceive the past, he definitely could not take action.</p><p>Because he could not beat him!</p><p>“I…”</p><p>For the first time, Night Guardian was shocked by a title.</p><p>The corner of his mouth twitched as if he wanted to laugh. Suddenly, he felt inexplicably sad and wanted to cry.</p><p>Amazing!</p><p>This Xu Xiaoshou was really amazing!</p><p>How did he dare to pretend to be the second son of the saint servant in such a situation where there were so many sovereign thrones and cutting path, and still do it perfectly?</p><p>How did he make the Storyteller confide in him without any doubt?</p><p>How did he imitate the second son of the Saint Servant, and still pretend to be so vivid and realistic?</p><p>He..</p><p>Night Guardian’s thoughts froze.</p><p>He paused for a moment, and then asked in a daze, “So, the Saint Servant, Sleeveless, is Elder Sang of Tiansang Spirit Palace, the Vice Dean of Tiansang City’s Alchemist Association.”</p><p>“That is, your master, Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>The suspicion that had appeared at the beginning, but was cast aside by everyone, now resurfaced in his mind.</p><p>Night Guardian could no longer remember how Red-robed and the others had forgotten this suspicion.</p><p>However, if the person in front of him was Xu Xiaoshou..</p><p>“So, that day in the city Lord Mansion, the Ghost Beast was you, and Zhang Taiying was innocent?”</p><p>“So, you are not only related to the Saint Servant, but also the Xu Yue Grey Palace and the Ghost Beast itself?”</p><p>“This, is also why you have been rejecting me?”</p><p>Night Guardian felt that his thoughts were all connected, and he suddenly roared angrily, “Yes or no!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was silent for a short while.</p><p>Surprisingly, Night Guardian did not disturb him.</p><p>After a long time, the straw hat was taken down. Xu Xiaoshou sighed.</p><p>“Yes and No.”</p><p>As his face changed, hair grew out of his slightly bald head. His deep, black eye sockets transformed into the clear eyes of a young man.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were sincere and filled with apology.</p><p>“I’m sorry for lying to you, but the situation forced me to do so. I had no choice but to do this. Otherwise, neither of us would have escaped from the Storyteller’s ancient book space.”</p><p>“To put it another way…”</p><p>“To put it another way, you saved my life?” Night Guardian roared.</p><p>“You can’t say it so directly…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled embarrassedly and said, “You can say it in a more tactful way. It’s more or less the same.”</p><p>“I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Night Guardian shouted and was about to pounce on him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was like a frightened bird. His body shook and he disappeared on the spot.</p><p>“Senior, please wait a moment. Let me explain to you…”</p><p>“What else do you have to quibble about!” Night Guardian went crazy. He changed his direction and pounced on him again.</p><p>“That’s right. Quibble. Whatever I say now is just quibbling. But I also have my difficulties!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou ascended to the sky in one step and appeared in the other side of the void again. He said seriously, “If it wasn’t for a reason, why would I be here? Don’t you agree?”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>“Okay, I’ll shut up.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately shut up.</p><p>The Night Guardian pounced on him a few times and finally calmed down.</p><p>Only then did he realize that Xu Xiaoshou did have skills like space transfer.</p><p>He immediately touched his cracked chest and panted, “Tell me everything. Tell me all the stupid things you’ve done.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately nodded. He could not be more obedient. He said, “It’s a long story. I’ll start from Tiansang Spirit Palace. I still remember that it was a sunny afternoon…”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Night Guardian was so angry that his face turned green.</p><p>Who had the time to listen to you, kid, start from Tiansang Spirit Palace?</p><p>You probably think that I’m not lame enough after being tricked by you!</p><p>“You told me to say it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pushed his hand forward. “Senior, calm down. Let’s talk about it properly. I’ll never forget the kindness of giving you a sword.”</p><p>He took out the famed sword, Flame Python.</p><p>However, when Night Guardian saw this sword, he felt like his entire body was about to split apart.</p><p>What did I do to fall for such a ridiculous junior and treat him as his successor?</p><p>How was he even human?</p><p>A madman!</p><p>A freak!</p><p>A weirdo and a pervert!</p><p>None of this was enough to describe this Xu guy!</p><p>Was this kid crazy?</p><p>How could he dare to reprimand the Storyteller like that? How could he dare to lie to more than ten sovereign thrones and Cut Path?</p><p>How could he dare..</p><p>Night Guardian was so mad that he couldn’t get any crazier.</p><p>He might have thought about it, but it really happened in front of him.</p><p>It had happened in the past, in the form of a memory that had been successfully realized..</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was simply intolerable to the heavens!</p><p>“Crossing the sky and crossing the sea, like a cicada escaping its shell…”</p><p>The Night Guardian clapped his hands together, mumbling listlessly.</p><p>He did not even know what reaction he should have given to this matter.</p><p>His heart was shocked and excited.</p><p>Admiration and worry were mixed.</p><p>But more than that, it was incomprehensible and unbelievable..</p><p>How did he do it? !</p><p>He must be the devil!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>Night Guardian suddenly calmed down. All the emotions in his body converged into one place and he threw it to the back of his mind.</p><p>“I don’t care what you did or why you did it, but there are two things that you can’t explain, so…”</p><p>“I didn’t kill anyone!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately understood.</p><p>When he realized that he had been exposed, he began to think of countermeasures.</p><p>“I didn’t kill anyone, and the Ghost Beast was only saved as a friend.”</p><p>“I won’t join any power.”</p><p>“The Saint Servant has nothing to do with me… My master is the Saint Servant, and I didn’t know until I entered the ancient book’s space and the Storyteller suddenly telepathic communication with me.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou kept on talking.</p><p>However, the Night Guardian suddenly sighed softly, “Xu Xiaoshou, do you think that I still dare to believe you?”</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>The Night Guardian believed that if it were anyone else, they wouldn’t be able to believe the young man in front of them. Which of his words were true and which were false.</p><p>“You don’t have to believe me.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened his heart and suddenly paused for a moment, “Look at my eyes.”</p><p>Night Guardian raised his eyes and looked over.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were clear, like a pool without fish, so clear that the bottom could be seen.</p><p>It was said that the eyes were the window to the soul.</p><p>But this time, Night Guardian suddenly felt that Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was like a vast ocean.</p><p>A mere window like this could give him a glimpse.</p><p>But what about the other side of the ocean tens of thousands of miles away, as well as the other side beneath the tip of the iceberg?</p><p>If it was in the past, the Night Guardian was confident that he could capture the mentality of any young man who was ignorant of worldly affairs. He was absolutely accurate.</p><p>But facing this young man in front of him, he suddenly lost all his courage.</p><p>“This old man can’t see through you…”</p><p>The Night Guardian said weakly, “So, this old man will never believe a single word of your words, no, not even a single word, not even a single tone!”</p><p>“I…” Xu Xiaoshou was speechless and could not say anything.</p><p>“Come with this old man. If you have anything to say, the prison of the Red-robed will be opened to you. Everything you said and did will become the final proof of your words.”</p><p>The eyes of the Night Guardian tightened. This place was directly shrouded in darkness.</p><p>At this moment, after he had completely lost the ability to judge the person in front of him, the only path he could choose was to follow his original intention and bring Xu Xiaoshou back.</p><p>In the Red-robed prison, there was always a lot of time to have a heart-to-heart.</p><p>To say..</p><p>It was not too late to say it after he had gone!</p><p>“I said, I won’t go with you.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head. “Xin Gugu was my friend, so I saved the Ghost Beast. Yu Zhiwen was my friend, so I didn’t kill her.”</p><p>“Everything I did was out of my own heart. I didn’t want to have anything to do with any power, nor did I want to be swayed by the one-sided words of the secular world.”</p><p>“Use your own eyes and walk your own path. That’s all!”</p><p>Night Guardian was very touched when he heard this.</p><p>You brat, how many connections do you have with these powers?</p><p>He waved his hand. “Xu Xiaoshou, the biggest mistake I’ve ever made in my life was meeting you at the City Lord Mansion’s entrance.”</p><p>If it weren’t for you, that Ghost Beast..</p><p>Night Guardian closed his eyes heavily.</p><p>“No, that wasn’t a mistake.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said resolutely, “That was luck!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The scene was silent for a long time.</p><p>Night Guardian slowly reached out his hand. “Don’t struggle anymore.”</p><p>“I’m not struggling.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou flipped his hand and took out Lu Ke’s human-shaped ice sculpture. “If you want to catch me, I’ll crush it.”</p><p>Night Guardian: ? ? ?</p><p>The corner of his mouth twitched again, and the veins on his face bulged.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou..</p><p>You Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>I was wondering, how could there be two people with such similar temperaments in this world?</p><p>In the ancient book space, they should have taken you down a long time ago!</p><p>“I didn’t kill him.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said sincerely, “What I did was for everyone. You can’t deal with the Storyteller. My friend is going to die.”</p><p>“What can I do?”</p><p>“I also want to live on my own, but I realized that I can’t do it!”</p><p>“I stood up, but…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the sky helplessly. “But I’m only an innate master. Will you listen to me? I have an idea. Will you let me carry it out? I dare to stop the Storyteller. Can you let me try?”</p><p>“I just want a result. A good result. That’s all.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou swallowed his saliva and nodded. “Can you?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Night Guardian shook his head.</p><p>He understood. He felt the same way, but he was also afraid.</p><p>He was afraid that Xu Xiaoshou was still the same Xu Xiaoshou, or that Xu Xiaoshou was no longer the same Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He was afraid of being cheated.</p><p>He was being lied to by Xu Xiaoshou, and his words were not the same!</p><p>“Come with me. When everything is explained, if you are not a suspect, I will definitely be able to protect you…”</p><p>“Bullshit!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly shouted. He paused and apologized, “Sorry, I spoke carelessly.”</p><p>“It’s okay, I don’t care.”</p><p>Night Guardian opened his arms. “Come with me, Xu Xiaoshou. Don’t make any more mistakes. Give me back the Lu Ke in your hands first.”</p><p>“I can’t give it back to you…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt a lump in his throat.</p><p>He understood the Night Guardian’s understanding of him, and he could also feel the tolerance of the elders in front of him.</p><p>But..</p><p>It was impossible to go back with him!</p><p>Not to mention Xin Gugu, not to mention caramel.</p><p>In his Yuan Mansion, there was a greedy cat spirit and a contract with the Ghost Beast.</p><p>Once all of this was revealed, even if he jumped into the Yellow River, he would not be able to clear his name!</p><p>But..</p><p>How could he not save him?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clenched his fists tightly. He felt that his real self suddenly felt powerless in the face of this world.</p><p>“Senior…”</p><p>“I can’t let you go!”</p><p>Night Guardian interrupted him, “Saint Servant, Ghost Beast, and you, Xu Xiaoshou, in the face of Red-robed, all of your deceitful acts. Strictly speaking, you can’t escape death.”</p><p>“Senior!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou interrupted him again in a loud voice, “How many times have I said that I’m not only doing this for myself, but also for…”</p><p>He could not go on.</p><p>“Saint Servant?” Xu Xiaoshou changed the topic and said bitterly, “I know you don’t believe me, but how can I resist when the Saint Servant wants me?”</p><p>“In the Tiansang Spirit Palace, in the outer yard, and even then, I was still struggling for the competition.”</p><p>“The roots were planted!”</p><p>“The roots were planted!”</p><p>“When I turned around, everything was already set in stone…”</p><p>“Elder Sang is already my master!”</p><p>Night Guardian’s eyes dimmed.</p><p>He did not believe Xin.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes suddenly turned red.</p><p>“Ghost Beast?”</p><p>“Ghost Beast, what can I do?”</p><p>“I, Xu Xiaoshou, have already told you about your belief in Red-robed. I don’t agree!”</p><p>“What I feel and agree with is the person who appeared in front of me with love and righteousness, not the Ghost Beast!”</p><p>“Do you dare to say that when you saw the determined minotaur of the Ghost Beast and the eight-winged Red Twin Dragon Python that had lost their reason, your heart didn’t waver at all?” Xu Xiaoshou shouted angrily.</p><p>I have..</p><p>Night Guardian agreed in his heart. However, their paths were different, and they didn’t conspire together.</p><p>Those who deserved to die, those who deserved to be exterminated, no matter how much the last rays of light bloomed, they were just struggling to survive and were powerless to resist.</p><p>They were worthy of sympathy.</p><p>However, any red-robed who was conscientious would not hold back for this.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was furious.</p><p>He saw the expression of the Night Guardian and had already guessed his inner reaction.</p><p>“But what about me?”</p><p>He roared and roared, “I’m just like most people who go to the Lijian Grassland and want to try my luck.”</p><p>“Who would have thought that there was a Storyteller there and an ancient book space that had been dormant for a long time?”</p><p>“They died…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of the young experiencer who died on the spot because of the Red-robed and the Storyteller.</p><p>“What about me?”</p><p>He asked back, “I entered the ancient book space. I’m not dead yet, and I don’t want to die yet!”</p><p>“What I’ve done, I’ve done it in a grand manner. The sacrifice is small, but the greater the better. Everyone, come out together.”</p><p>“A more selfish way of saying it…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered for a moment and said heavily, “I’m doing it for myself! I just want to survive, that’s all.”</p><p>“Is there anything wrong? !”</p><p>There was nothing wrong… Night Guardian closed his eyes heavily, but..</p><p>“I just want to survive…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of the White Cave, the City Lord Mansion, and the Tiansang Spirit Palace. He suddenly felt tears welling up in his eyes.</p><p>He thought of Xin Gugu.</p><p>He also thought of that lonely white ward.</p><p>His suppressed emotions, which were about to roar like a ferocious beast, seemed to be softened by all these memories. Xu Xiaoshou lowered his voice, as if he was talking to himself.</p><p>“I just want to have more friends while I’m still alive. That’s all.”</p><p>“Is there anything wrong with that?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
