Kid, aren’t you a Red Coat? Have you forgotten the rules of the Red Coat? Do you think it’s appropriate to pretend to be someone else and ruin someone’s reputation here?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grabbed the famed sword, Green Scaled Ridge, and swept a cold glance over.</p><p>After these words were said, all the black-robed people panicked.</p><p>“Red Coat?”</p><p>“This doesn’t seem right!”</p><p>“Boss, is this really a Red Coat? If this fellow is a Red Coat, why would he ignore our actions?”</p><p>The black-robed second brother was shocked.</p><p>He was completely unaware of this point and he was even more confused.</p><p>If this youth was a Red Coat, how could he do the opposite and urge them to do such a thing?</p><p>The black-robed youth looked around and clearly saw the panic in the eyes of his companions.</p><p>“I’m not a Red Coat. You’re mistaken,” he said in a low voice.</p><p>“Deceived, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sneered.</p><p>“Why are you still pretending?”</p><p>“Little Red Coat, do you really think I don’t know anything?”</p><p>“If I remember correctly…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of the Night Guardian’s words at the end of the Flame Python incident and said, “Lu Ke?”</p><p>“Uh.”</p><p>The black-robed youth was obviously startled.</p><p>“What? I’ve called your name and you can’t keep up with the pretense?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled. “Little brat, the Night Guardian is looking for you. He told me that if you don’t return to the team, he’ll beat your ass to a pulp.”</p><p>“You!”</p><p>“Glared At, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>The young man in the black robe, Lu Ke, was obviously shocked by Xu Xiaoshou’s tone, but he did not respond. Instead, he said, “Xu Xiaoshou, don’t forget that you’re now ranked first on the Red Coat’s blacklist of the White Cave.”</p><p>“Even though I am not in the team at the moment, I still received the notice from the Night Guardian.”</p><p>“Now that you have encountered a Red Coat, don’t you think it’s very interesting to show off here instead of giving up?”</p><p>He snorted coldly, and a trace of coldness appeared in his eyes.</p><p>However, after these words, Xu Xiaoshou did not have much of a reaction.</p><p>On the other hand, the group of black-robed people who were originally gathered around him was like frightened birds, feeling uneasy.</p><p>“It’s really a Red Coat?”</p><p>“Darn it, how could such a young Red Coat man appear? Boss, why didn’t you say anything?”</p><p>“Do you know something?”</p><p>“If this fellow is a Red Coat, then if we run away from the Thirty-Six Heavens Sealed Array, wouldn’t that be…”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>The black-robed boss couldn’t help but shout because he was also kept in the dark.</p><p>But it did not matter if the youth in front of him was a Red Coat or not.</p><p>When that fellow attacked and took him down, the ability that he revealed was not something that an ordinary spiritual cultivator could resist.</p><p>What could he do?</p><p>Other than obeying and acting according to the youth’s orders, what else could he do?</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Seeing the black-robed boss’s iron-faced silence, the crowd finally could not hold on any longer.</p><p>They were originally a team formed at the last minute.</p><p>At this moment, even the boss’s will was shaken. How could this team be maintained?</p><p>After a shout burst out, and the crowd dispersed like birds and beasts.</p><p>“Who dares to leave?”</p><p>Seeing that the person in front of them was about to leave, the young Lu Ke gave a clear shout and the sword intent that filled the sky directly locked down the entire scene.</p><p>This time, the people surrounding the Spirit Palace were all shocked.</p><p>They saw that the people around them who had raised their legs preparing to run, their bodies exploded with white sword aura. Not only did it lock down their bodies, but they were also battered.</p><p>“Master Sword Intent?”</p><p>Su Qianqian was shocked.</p><p>Looking at the level of this young man’s sword intent, although they were both at the Master Stage, he was many times more powerful than her, who had just entered the sect.</p><p>Just by looking at the usage of this, All Things are Swords skill, it was completely not at the level of someone who had just become a master swordsman.</p><p>At the very least, in terms of the swordsmen present that could contend against that young man…</p><p>Su Qianqian could not help but look back at Big Brother Shou.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also had a surprised look on his face.</p><p>He could also use the “I Am the Sword” skill.</p><p>However, if he wanted to be like this young man, not only did he have to control people, he could also hurt people.</p><p>Not only could he injure others, but he could also injure them to the point of perfection. According to each person’s constitution, the corresponding amount of sword intent would be distributed differently.</p><p>It would completely cause the accused to be unable to resist, but he would have to continuously endure the pain…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou indicated that he could not do it.</p><p>It was too exquisite!</p><p>Moreover, after this move, this youth was still so relaxed.</p><p>It could be seen that this burst of sword intent was based on his wishes, and he could do it with ease.</p><p>“I want to make a deal with you.”</p><p>Seeing that everyone was controlled and could no longer interfere with his actions, the youth, Lu Ke, said.</p><p>“A deal?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows and looked at the famed sword in his hand.</p><p>“Not this one.”</p><p>The corner of Lu Ke’s eyes twitched, and he pulled it with his hand.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The Green Scale Ridge on Xu Xiaoshou’s hand suddenly buzzed and shook until his palm was numb.</p><p>“Go in.”</p><p>He casually threw this thing into his Yuan Mansion. Xu Xiaoshou smiled and said, “What deal?”</p><p>“Where did you lock my sword?” Lu Ke was shocked.</p><p>He actually couldn’t sense any aura of the Green Scale Ridge after Xu Xiaoshou’s action.</p><p>This meant that the place where Xu Xiaoshou closed the Green Scale Ridge was definitely not the spatial ring.</p><p>After all, if it was that kind of space, with a casual summon of his hand, the Green Scale Ridge would definitely return.</p><p>“You don’t need to know…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said with a smile.</p><p>But halfway through his words, he saw the young Lu Ke form a seal in his hand, and a loud and clear dragon’s roar suddenly came from his Yuan Mansion.</p><p>“Ang –”</p><p>After the roar, the sword intent soared into the sky.</p><p>A green light shot out from his Yuan Mansion and flipped in the air twice before landing directly in Lu Ke’s hand.</p><p>“Green Scale Ridge?”</p><p>After seeing that it was the famed sword that he had locked up, it was Xu Xiaoshou’s turn to be surprised.</p><p>He could summon the famed sword even if it was in his Yuan Mansion?</p><p>“It’s useless.”</p><p>Su Qianqian laughed lightly and explained, “Big Brother Shou, if he is the real famed sword sword-bearer, then no matter where the famed sword is, it will be able to return in time when its owner calls for it.”</p><p>“This is the famed sword!”</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>Lu Ke snorted and continued, “Xu Xiaoshou, I just wanted to make a deal with you, but I didn’t expect you to…”</p><p>“Who doesn’t love a famed sword?” Xu Xiaoshou interrupted him indifferently.</p><p>Although he didn’t expect such an existence like the famed sword to be able to break through the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>But if he couldn’t keep it, then he couldn’t keep it. It wasn’t a big deal.</p><p>No wonder this young man didn’t seem to panic at all when his own sword was taken away by someone else.</p><p>It turned out that the famed sword had recognized him as its master and was actually so powerful.</p><p>“Yuan Mansion…”</p><p>He murmured and Xu Xiaoshou asked, “What deal?”</p><p>“The Flame Python!”</p><p>Lu Ke went straight to the point and said, “I want your Flame Python.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“You’re also thinking about my sword?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused. “Isn’t that strange? I’m thinking about your sword, and you’re also thinking about mine. Why don’t we exchange?”</p><p>As he said that, he took out the Flame Python from his ring.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes fixed on it. Even Rao Yinyin was stunned.</p><p>“Is it really a famed sword?”</p><p>No one could tell that it was a Flame Python.</p><p>However, the dark red sword in Xu Xiaoshou’s hand gave off an aura that was on the same level as the one in Lu Ke’s hand…</p><p>Was it on the same level?</p><p>“Big Brother Shou…”</p><p>Su Qianqian was stunned.</p><p>When she saw Xu Xiaoshou take out the famed sword, she was not surprised or happy at first.</p><p>On the contrary, a deep-rooted phantom that looked like a nightmare appeared in her mind.</p><p>It was the Masked Man!</p><p>“If it’s really the famed sword, Big Brother Shou, will you be targeted by that guy too?”</p><p>“Received Concern, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Sure enough, it can only be in your hands.”</p><p>Lu Ke exclaimed and his eyes became fiery. “Xu Xiaoshou, give me the famed sword. I can guarantee that I won’t reveal your whereabouts. The Red Coat men will also not get the information of your location.”</p><p>“That’s it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>“Isn’t that enough?”</p><p>Lu Ke was also stunned. “Do you know that the first target on the Red Coat’s blacklist is no longer the ghost beast, but you!”</p><p>“Do you know the dangers of your current circumstances?”</p><p>“I know.” Xu Xiaoshou spread out his hands. “But, so what?”</p><p>Lu Ke was speechless and he was suddenly choked by these crazy words.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou… chi.”</p><p>He couldn’t help but laugh. Lu Ke’s eyes were full of sarcasm. “You are too naive. There is an inescapable net outside the White Cave. You can’t escape, do you know that?”</p><p>“I see…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes finally calmed down.</p><p>But he thought about his Vanishing Technique.</p><p>“Little fellow, you do not need to be worried about my safety.”</p><p>“If this is all you have to offer, then you should take advantage of my good mood and leave quickly!”</p><p>“Otherwise, I don’t need you to save my life. As long as no one here has the opportunity to leak the news, then naturally, no one will leak my whereabouts.”</p><p>After saying this, everyone felt a chill in their hearts.</p><p>Seeing Xu Xiaoshou’s smiling face, they suddenly felt an inexplicable pressure.</p><p>Even the people from the Spirit Palace were silent for a moment.</p><p>“Hahaha, you want to kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ke laughed, “It’s a good idea, but you don’t have the strength at the moment!”</p><p>“Maybe.” Xu Xiaoshou frowned.</p><p>To be honest, he couldn’t see the young man’s strength clearly.</p><p>Not just anyone could be the owner of a famed sword.</p><p>People like Su Qianqian wouldn’t be able to pass if they didn’t have a strong background.</p><p>They wouldn’t be able to protect the famed sword at all.</p><p>The words were a little harsh but it was true.</p><p>Lu Ke not only had the identity of the sword-bearer but he also belonged to the Red Coat.</p><p>“He has a powerful background.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand.</p><p>“You should leave. If you want to reveal my whereabouts, go ahead. Since I dare to come here, I won’t be afraid of this.”</p><p>At the moment, the Path Pattern Initial Stone was more important.</p><p>Once he got the treasure, he would immediately escape. No one would be able to retain him.</p><p>When Lu Ke heard this, he was a little surprised and uncertain.</p><p>There was still someone in the White Cave who was not afraid of the Red Coat?</p><p>And it was a young man?</p><p>“You…”</p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Lu Ke said again, “Give me the famed sword, and I’ll give you the Path Pattern Initial Stone!”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes immediately lit up. “You have the Path Pattern Initial Stone?”</p><p>“I don’t.”</p><p>Lu Ke shook his head and pointed at the ground. “But there’s one here.”</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately laughed out loud. “You brat, you’re really funny. I’m here. Do you think that I don’t know that there’s one here?”</p><p>Lu Ke said, “I know that you know, but… I’m also here!”</p><p>The people from the Spirit Palace were originally happy.</p><p>However, their laughter suddenly stopped.</p><p>Mu Zixi was stunned for a moment before she slowly said, “Xu Xiaoshou, I’ve finally met someone who’s even more arrogant than you.”</p><p>“Crushed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the random information column and gritted his teeth as if he was having a toothache. He was just about to say something.</p><p>“Draw!”</p><p>Lu Ke placed his long sword behind his back and formed a hand seal with both of his hands before he suddenly struck the ground.</p><p>“Dong Dong.”</p><p>A muffled sound, like the beating of a heart, shook the ground twice.</p><p>The ground suddenly shook.</p><p>In the next moment, it shook violently.</p><p>“Ka Ka!”</p><p>Along with the sound of cracking, a beam of light shot out from under Xu Xiaoshou’s feet.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly dodged it.</p><p>“The Heaven and Earth phenomenon?”</p><p>He looked at everything in front of him in surprise.</p><p>Lu Ke could stir up Heaven and Earth phenomenon?</p><p>“All the treasures in White Cave have been sealed by a Red Coat.”</p><p>“They don’t take them just because they don’t need them.”</p><p>“Even though it’s called a training ground, to put it bluntly, these treasures are used to reward those who dare to enter the White Cave and have the ability to take them.”</p><p>Lu Ke explained, and suddenly there was a hint of a smile on his voice.</p><p>“However, if it is really necessary, it only needs a seal. Even if it is a treasure that has yet to be unearthed and urgently needs to be nurtured, the Red Coat can take it back too!”</p><p>He removed the seal and looked up at the sky.</p><p>The light beam produced by the Heaven and Earth phenomenon of the Path Pattern Initial Stone was no less than the one produced by the famed sword Flame Python when it was unearthed.</p><p>Not only that, as the Heaven and Earth’s Power of Punishment gradually decreased, the dense path mechanism also spread out in an instant.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>Rings of path mechanism ripples spread out from the center of the light beam.</p><p>In just an instant, they enveloped everyone present and continuously spread out.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>This was because everyone could sense that along with the fluctuations of this path mechanism, their cultivation base seemed to be starting to loosen.</p><p>The bottleneck that was normally difficult to comprehend and break was faintly showing signs of being broken.</p><p>And those spiritual techniques that had yet to be mastered were also enlightened by the ripples of this streak of opportunity.</p><p>The ones with the most intense reactions were the spiritual cultivators who were already at the peak of the Upper Spiritual Level.</p><p>Tan Ji was originally lying on the ground, but suddenly, like a dead fish that had been hit by a knife, he bounced up from the ground and sat up straight.</p><p>“This!”</p><p>He had woken up a long time ago.</p><p>He didn’t want to talk, because he couldn’t face Xu Xiaoshou and the people of the Spirit Palace.</p><p>However, with the appearance of the Path Pattern Initial Stone, he couldn’t pretend anymore.</p><p>The cultivation level that he was desperately suppressing was like a rocket that was ignited at this moment, and he couldn’t help but jump up.</p><p>“Suppress it!”</p><p>Tan Ji roared furiously in his heart and his expression turned savage.</p><p>He mobilized all the strength in his body to suppress the turbulent energy reserve.</p><p>Master Stage?</p><p>If this thing wanted to break through, Tan Ji would have been able to do so long ago.</p><p>However, wasn’t the reason he had been maintaining his cultivation level was for the sake of Dongtianwang City?</p><p>If his cultivation level was really broken through for no reason at this moment, then wouldn’t all his previous efforts go down the drain?</p><p>It wasn’t just him.</p><p>At the moment of the excavation, more than ten people present almost couldn’t suppress their cultivation and wanted to complete the breakthrough.</p><p>And those who couldn’t be suppressed… were also present!</p><p>“Buzz.”</p><p>Mu Zixi raised her twin ponytails and wilted again.</p><p>Inexplicably, her cultivation level had broken through to the Upper Spiritual Level.</p><p>It was as if someone had hit her head with a stick, and it took her quite a while to regain her senses.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face was also filled with disbelief.</p><p>With just this one wave of path mechanism, he began to feel that the door to the Upper Spiritual Level was opening for him.</p><p>However, it was different from the others.</p><p>His door to the Upper Spiritual Level seemed to be much more solid.</p><p>Even if he had the tendency to push it open, if he didn’t give it a big push, with just this small wave of energy…</p><p>Could only affect it, not push it away!</p><p>“But this, isn’t it too strong?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was still very surprised.</p><p>This was just a fluctuation when it was just unearthed, yet it had such an influence.</p><p>If it was to be used for cultivation… it would be amazing!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was excited.</p><p>As expected, this Path Pattern Initial Stone was indeed worthy of being called a supreme treasure that could be used by Sovereign powerhouses to comprehend the Way of the Heavens.</p><p>It had just been unearthed and was already so useful.</p><p>If it was embedded in the Yuan Mansion, not only would the space of the Yuan Mansion be greatly expanded, but in the future, cultivating in it would be even faster!</p><p>“How about it? Think about it?”</p><p>“You should know that as the ripples of the Path Pattern Initial Stone spread, it will soon attract more people here. When that time comes…”</p><p>Lu Ke’s eyes were full of smiles and he did not say anything more.</p><p>He naturally knew how powerful the Path Pattern Initial Stone was.</p><p>He had brought many black-robed men here intending to take out this item for his own cultivation.</p><p>He had also used the name of Xu Xiaoshou to lure that fellow out.</p><p>However, he did not expect that he would not be able to find it even after he had worn out his iron shoes.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was actually here!</p><p>Then, compared to the Path Pattern Initial Stone, the famed sword was clearly more attractive.</p><p>The transaction would naturally take place.</p><p>“Nothing much.”</p><p>Before Xu Xiaoshou could say anything, Yu Zhiwen, who was by his side, spoke indifferently.</p><p>“Red Coat is in charge of exploring the extradimensional space. At the same time, they are also in charge of sealing unstable and incomplete treasures. This is their duty.”</p><p>“But there is no rule that says that you can break the seal at any time as long as you want it.”</p><p>“It is still a supreme treasure that did not come into being on its own!”</p><p>She pointed at the Path Pattern Initial Stone in the void and said coldly, “On this point, you have seriously violated the rules. Do you know your crime?”</p><p>“Who are you?” Lu Ke’s pupils constricted.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter who I am. What is important is that you should not use the treasures here to trade.” There was anger in Yu Zhiwen’s tone.</p><p>How important was the Path Pattern Initial Stone?</p><p>After she came here, she could already feel that this thing was less than half a day away from being nurtured to the peak and being unearthed on its own.</p><p>This should be the reason why Rao Yinyin was waiting here.</p><p>However, Lu Ke actually broke the seal for his own benefit.</p><p>If it was something else, Yu Zhiwen might not be so angry.</p><p>However, she could not stand seeing such a supreme treasure that could be used to assist the Divine Secret being destroyed like this.</p><p>“Seal!”</p><p>With a wave of her hands, a light screen of the Divine Secret directly wrapped around the Path Pattern Initial Stone in the void.</p><p>Before the Power of Heaven’s Punishment had completely fallen, she had gathered the Heaven and Earth Path Energy and directly pressed it into the Path Pattern Initial Stone, wanting to help it grow to the peak.</p><p>The treasure had already been unearthed.</p><p>Sealing it back was also possible, but it was not something that Yu Zhiwen’s current cultivation level could do.</p><p>The only thing she could do was to take advantage of the short time when the Path Pattern Initial Stone was born to speed up the process of nurturing the Way of the Heavens’ energy movement.</p><p>Otherwise, although this Path Pattern Initial Stone could be born, it would definitely leave behind irreparable flaws.</p><p>“Divine Secret?”</p><p>Lu Ke looked at all of this with disbelief in his eyes.</p><p>“You, you’re from the Path Division?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen glared at him hatefully.</p><p>This fellow might not even know how much of an impact this half a day had had on the real Path Pattern Initial Stone.</p><p>But at this moment, she did not have the spare energy to explain.</p><p>“How did the people from the Path Division… The headquarters of the Holy Divine Palace come here?”</p><p>Lu Ke saw that Yu Zhiwen was silent, and his heart was slightly flustered.</p><p>He suddenly thought of the Red Coat’s previous message.</p><p>Could it be that his master had already arrived?</p><p>His heart was suddenly shocked. At this moment, Lu Ke even had the thought of turning around to leave.</p><p>But on second thought, even if his master had arrived, the only thing he should be concerned about was the fight between the upper echelons of the White Cave.</p><p>How could such a small fight be noticed?</p><p>“Steady, steady.”</p><p>Forcefully suppressing his impulse, Lu Ke raised his head and asked Xu Xiaoshou again, “What do you think? Handover the famed sword and the Path Pattern Initial Stone will be yours?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw that Yu Zhiwen was trying her best. He narrowed his eyes slightly and said, “Nothing much!”</p><p>“So what if you’ve broken the seal?”</p><p>“Putting aside the fact that this thing doesn’t belong to you in the first place, just the fact that my friend has put in so much effort for it, this Path Pattern Initial Stone is no longer a treasure that you can use to trade.”</p><p>“Needless to say, the famed sword, the Path Pattern Initial Stone is also not something that you can get your hands on!”</p><p>Lu Ke frowned.</p><p>Why was Xu Xiaoshou so stubborn?</p><p>“Handover the famed sword. Not only will I give you the Path Pattern Initial Stone, but I will also guarantee that you will escape from the White Cave and not be caught by the Red Coat people!” He took another step back.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but look sideways. “Are you sure?”</p><p>“That’s because…”</p><p>Before Lu Ke could finish, Yu Zhiwen looked at him coldly again. “Lu Ke… is it? Don’t forget that you are a Red Coat as well!”</p><p>Although she was on Xu Xiaoshou’s side at the moment.</p><p>However, when she saw that such a rascal disregarded the rules in her organization, she naturally could not hold back.</p><p>“Even though I am a Red Coat, but I am only an intern.”</p><p>Lu Ke shook his head. “My true ambition is not with the Red Coat, so you don’t have to use the rules of those Red Coats to suppress me. Compared to the rules, the famed sword is more suitable for me.”</p><p>“But you are still a Red Coat!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen said angrily, “At least, you are still wearing the Red Coat.”</p><p>“Ha.”</p><p>Lu Ke pointed at the black robe and said, “How do you know that I am wearing…”</p><p>However, he was not finished.</p><p>In the Void, the power of Divine Secrets twisted and crushed the black robe inch by inch.</p><p>The wind blew, and the Red Coat, which had been curled up a little, opened up with a rustling sound.</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>He was indeed a Red Coat!</p><p>Even though he was so young, it was undeniable that this young man was wearing the Red Coat, which symbolized one of the two most transcendent special organizations in the continent!</p><p>“Lu Ke.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen took a deep breath and said, “Before you take off this Red Coat, even if it hasn’t become official, you are still a Red Coat.”</p><p>“And Red Coats have to follow the rules.”</p><p>“Rules are rules. No one can break them.”</p><p>“This is not only the rule of the Red Coats but also the… rule of the Holy Divine Palace!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
