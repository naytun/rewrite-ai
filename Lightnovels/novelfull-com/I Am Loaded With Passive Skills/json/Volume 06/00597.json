I was under the impression that your injuries weren’t healed yet!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang smiled.</p><p>After a long while, seeing that the person in front of him wasn’t saying anything, he finally stopped smiling and faced the other party’s question.</p><p>“I don’t dare to think about dying.”</p><p>“But the damned person has already been resurrected.”</p><p>As he spoke, he shifted his gaze downwards and glanced at the famed sword on his neck. Without batting an eyelid, he said, “Get out of the way.”</p><p>“What exactly are you trying to say?” Hua Changdeng narrowed his eyes with a sharp gaze. Killing intent seemed to be overflowing from his eyes.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang simply sighed helplessly.</p><p>“Bazhun’an has been resurrected.”</p><p>A faint voice echoed through the screen. In this place where not even the slightest sound of wind could be heard, the scene became deathly silent and terrifying.</p><p>Hua Changdeng remained silent.</p><p>He recalled the ghost hunter and disappeared with a whoosh. He then returned to the broken willow to take a nap.</p><p>“If you’re bored and are just joking around…”</p><p>“It’s not a joke.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang interrupted him. With a wave of his hand, a light curtain appeared in front of him.</p><p>On the light curtain was the scene of the confrontation between the masked man and Gou Wuyue in the eighth palace.</p><p>Below the large screen were the images transmitted from the four small crystal balls in the Eighth Palace of the eastern region. Above them were four people who appeared very anxious.</p><p>They seemed to be waiting for a response from the headquarters.</p><p>Although they didn’t say a word, it was obvious that they had many questions.</p><p>“Anyway, I can’t exactly tell. You actually fought with him. Do you know who he is?” Dao Qiongcang pointed at the masked man and asked.</p><p>“You’ve never fought with him before?” Hua Changdeng asked.</p><p>“I have, but the Way of the Heavens’ energy movement can no longer detect this person’s existence anymore. The Holy Emperor’s power has blocked his aura. He has people helping him!”</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>Hua Changdeng sneered. “Is this the so-called supreme great path? If you can’t even tell if a person exists or not, how can you talk about mastering the Great Path?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang choked.</p><p>He didn’t refute but asked again, “So, is it him? Bazhun’an?”</p><p>“Snore!”</p><p>Hua Changdeng started snoring.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was rendered speechless by this.</p><p>He was furious.</p><p>“Hua Changdeng! Say something!”</p><p>“Is it time to fool around?”</p><p>“If not, then the saint servant has the support of the Holy Emperor.”</p><p>“If it is, then not only does the saint servant have the support of the Holy Emperor, but the person in charge is also the Eighth Sword Deity!”</p><p>“Can you imagine the consequences?”</p><p>“If he raises his arm and shouts…”</p><p>“You’re so noisy!” Hua Changdeng turned over in annoyance, sniffled, and said lazily, “Isn’t Gou Wuyue there?”</p><p>“Yes! So?”</p><p>“So you think that a guy who can’t even break through the realm of sword deity can escape from the hands of the Seven Sword Deity?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had been angered again. He said angrily, “Did you lock yourself up for decades just to make a fool of yourself?”</p><p>“If he was Bazhun’an, how could Gou Wuyue attack him?”</p><p>“The Voice of Nulan is in his hands. Gou Wuyue hasn’t repaid Bazhun’an the favor he owes him. How could he attack him?”</p><p>Hua Changdeng was thoroughly annoyed.</p><p>“Imbecile!”</p><p>He stood up and scolded, “Can you not decide between the Holy Divine Palace’s power and Bazhun’an’s favor?”</p><p>“Since the two of them have met, then it’s the perfect…”</p><p>“Didn’t you say that Gou Wuyue doesn’t like the Holy Divine Palace?”</p><p>“Isn’t this an opportunity?”</p><p>“Let him do it!”</p><p>“If he dares to let him go, then he must be prepared to pay a corresponding price after letting him go. And if Gou Wuyue doesn’t dare to let him go, as long as he kills Bazhun’an, do you still think that there’s anything in the world worth him turning hostile for?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was startled by the shout. After a long time, he sighed and said, “So, it really is Bazhun’an…”</p><p>“He didn’t die!”</p><p>Hua Changdeng closed his eyes and lay down again. “That day, I only severed two of his fingers and cut off his head. How could I behead him before he became a Saint?”</p><p>As he spoke, he lowered his voice and looked at the other side of Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>Even so, this way of doing things also attracted disaster.</p><p>On Luoshen Peak, there was an unknown gravestone.</p><p>“But didn’t you disable Bazhun’an?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang asked, “What about the weapon prohibition order? Didn’t you send it out as well?”</p><p>Hua Changdeng sighed.</p><p>“Yes, I did…”</p><p>“Can’t you see that he’s just acquired his current cultivation level?”</p><p>“But the world is so big. Not everyone can be restricted by the weapon prohibition order.”</p><p>“At the very least, it is able to seal off swords, seal off people’s killing intents, and stop their desire to kill… But once they break free, these desires will all bounce back.”</p><p>The scene fell silent again.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s eyes wandered, and he could not make up his mind.</p><p>He was silent for a long time before he said, “Are you really not afraid that Gou Wuyue will let him go?”</p><p>“Anyway, I can’t go out now.” Hua Changdeng fell asleep on the ground.</p><p>“I can help you.”</p><p>“How?”</p><p>Hua Changdeng sneered. “Don’t tell me that you brought You Tu here? Or you killed him?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>A mysterious smile appeared on Dao Qiongcang’s face. “I can help you block the way of the Heavens’energy movement and temporarily solve this predicament. Then, I’ll send you there. You will have fifteen minutes of freedom.”</p><p>“Just a mere fifteen minutes…”</p><p>Hua Changdeng knew his predicament and said, “My mission is no longer to wander around the various regions of the continent.”</p><p>“Scared Mountain Gui Zhe is not bad. It’s a natural prison, I can be locked up there by that old man, You Tu.”</p><p>“With Gou Wuyue in the eastern region, you don’t need to worry blindly. He knows what’s important.”</p><p>“And…”</p><p>After a pause, Hua Changdeng added, “A demi-saint’s power is capable of influencing many things. Do you really think that Wen Ting will choose to stand by and do nothing if I actually do something?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was stunned.</p><p>He turned his head to look at the distant Eastern Mountain. His gaze seemed to pierce through time and space and saw the eastern mountain that was suffused with decaying Sword Will Possession.</p><p>“Yes…”</p><p>He murmured.</p><p>There was still someone in the burial sword tomb who could invite the sword of the Eastern Mountain.</p><p>Even if the way of the Heavens’ energy movement was not big, that guy was probably only one step away from demi-saint.</p><p>It was hard to say if a stimulus would help him move forward and enter that realm.</p><p>With Wen Ting’s friendship with Bazhun’an, would he sit back and watch Hua Changdeng hurt his old friend?</p><p>“It’s a pity.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked disappointed. “Looks like the show has ended.”</p><p>He turned his head and glanced at Hua Changdeng one last time.</p><p>“You really don’t want to go out for a walk?”</p><p>Buzz —</p><p>Before Hua Changdeng could say anything, the famed sword of the Ghost Hunter’s spiritual quality quivered as if it had already given an answer.</p><p>“Silence.”</p><p>Hua Changdeng swept his cold gaze over, and the Ghost Hunter immediately returned to silence.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Hua Changdeng said this word heavily, and then he snorted. His voice weakened a little. “But not now.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang waved his sleeve and was about to take the light curtain and leave.</p><p>“Wait.”</p><p>Hua Changdeng suddenly stopped him.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked over and saw that the person sleeping on the ground had widened his eyes at some point in time. He was staring at an unremarkable figure on the light curtain.</p><p>“Who is he?” Hua Changdeng asked.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang took a closer look and realized why Hua Changdeng paid special attention to this square-faced, bearded young man.</p><p>“Fourth Sword?”</p><p>“Who is he?” Hua Changdeng asked again.</p><p>“Er…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang didn’t know how to say this for a moment. He thought for a moment and then said, “Wen Ming? Xu Xiaoshou? Xiao Shi Tan Ji?”</p><p>“I don’t know. This person has many names, but…”</p><p>“The successor of the Eighth Sword Deity?” Gou Wuyue looked at Fourth Sword and stopped talking.</p><p>“Xiao Shi Tan Ji… Huh?”</p><p>Hua Changdeng took a deep look, as if he wanted to carve that figure into his memory. Then, he looked away.</p><p>Long hair, beard, square face.</p><p>Very good.</p><p>I, Hua Changdeng, will remember you!</p><p>..</p><p>In the eighth palace.</p><p>“Da da da!”</p><p>The rain seemed to be heavier here.</p><p>This “heavy” was actually really heavy.</p><p>From the moment the masked man broke through the dark clouds to the moment the dark clouds gathered.</p><p>The whole process only took about 15 minutes.</p><p>When the rain started to fall again, the raindrops that were supposed to be cut into powder by Chang Yi’s ‘light rhythm’ suddenly became fearless of the light as they fell.</p><p>The rain seemed to have lost its surface tension.</p><p>Even if it was cut open by a ray of light as it fell, it stuck together the moment it left the light.</p><p>From the sky to the ground.</p><p>The end of a raindrop’s life.</p><p>However, when he landed on the ground, a deep hole was created.</p><p>“Dong dong dong…”</p><p>The rain inexplicably became heavier.</p><p>It had already become like the sound of a dull drum, and the ground began to become bumpy.</p><p>Every drop of rain hitting the ground seemed to be able to stir up the heartbeat of dozens of people in this deathly silent scene.</p><p>“Achoo!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not stop himself from sneezing. He immediately transformed into his disappearing form to solve the problem. Then, he adjusted his comfortable posture and hid behind the masked man. Only then did he reveal himself.</p><p>That was close…</p><p>In this completely stiff atmosphere, it was as if he had caught a cold. He could not even control the urge to sneeze.</p><p>However, such a sudden sound on a normal day would definitely bring back hundreds and thousands of passive points.</p><p>At this moment, the information bar could only contribute to this one.</p><p>“Attention received, passive points, +2.”</p><p>“Only two people noticed me…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself that he was lucky. These white-clothed, red-clothed, and gray-clothed people were really shocked by that sentence just now.</p><p>“My name is Bazhun’an!”</p><p>Even though he had made a similar guess before, when he heard this sentence with his own ears, Xu Xiaoshou could not help but feel his blood boiling.</p><p>It was only now that he fully understood why Cen Qiaofu, the storyteller, and even Elder Sang were willing to follow in this person’s footsteps.</p><p>It was also only now that he truly understood what the masked man by the Goose Lake in Tiansang Spirit Palace meant when he said, “Your path has long been ruined.”.</p><p>“Bazhun’an…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou mumbled.</p><p>He had never thought that a person’s name alone could be so domineering.</p><p>He stole a glance at the other people beside him.</p><p>He saw that the storyteller’s eyes were full of stars, but even Cen Qiaofu’s face was full of excitement. It was simply intangible.</p><p>“You guys, don’t you know that he’s Bazhun’an?” Xu Xiaoshou asked in a low voice through telepathic communication.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu replied in a rare instant.</p><p>“I’ve guessed, but I haven’t been able to verify it.”</p><p>After a pause, he added, “I’ve confirmed it with my own mouth!”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded. “So you believe him when he says that he is Bazhun’an?”</p><p>“?”</p><p>The stars in the storyteller’s eyes instantly disappeared and turned into sharp swords, slashing viciously at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a chill down his spine.</p><p>“Of course I f*cking believe it. I really believe it. I really do!”</p><p>“Bling!”</p><p>The stars appeared once again.</p><p>Only then did Xu Xiaoshou heave a sigh of relief.</p><p>F*ck, was this the deterrent power from the fans?</p><p>It was really terrifying!</p><p>..</p><p>“Stand down!”</p><p>Gou Wuyue, who had been silent for a long time, spoke again.</p><p>This first sentence was not said to the so-called Bazhun’an, but to his subordinates.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Everyone present was like a spring that had been waiting for a long time. In an instant, they had disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“Cen Qiaofu.”</p><p>The masked man said the same thing.</p><p>Old Woodcutter’s motionless body had finally finished accumulating power. There was not the slightest movement. The small ax in his hand suddenly flew up. He was not afraid of the light-bounded domain that had super strong cutting power.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>It expanded in midair and exploded with airwaves. It turned into a mottled giant ax that was about ten feet long.</p><p>“Pan Xian Axe, heaven and earth return to origin!”</p><p>The Axe slashed down from the sky.</p><p>Space and earth did not move at all.</p><p>However, the “light-bounded domain” suddenly turned into a blurry purple color and was sucked into the ax body by the Pan Xian Axe.</p><p>“It broke?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at this inexplicable situation and did not dare to try it easily.</p><p>It seemed like Chang Yi’s bounded domain was broken.</p><p>However, the light of Heaven and earth wasn’t completely gone. It was just a little weaker.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but move his fingers, but he still tried to test it out.</p><p>However, his fingers didn’t directly shatter into a bloody mist like before. Xu Xiaoshou then heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>“It’s really broken.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt rather regretful that he had really lost his bounded domain.</p><p>“What a pity. I should have moved a few more times just now…”</p><p>It was indeed a wonderful feeling to be able to sneeze without using the vanishing technique.</p><p>However, even if he could move, Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to make any big moves at this moment.</p><p>He shifted his position and quietly stepped in front of Cen Qiaofu and the storyteller. Then, he looked at the legendary Bazhun’an in front of him and felt a sense of security.</p><p>The triangle had stability.</p><p>Now, if others wanted to kill me, they had to break through the three giants of the saint servant.</p><p>So this time, I, Xu Xiaoshou, should be able to survive.</p><p>No one cared about the small details of Xu Xiaoshou, and the main character present was not him.</p><p>Gou Wuyue cleared the white-clothed area and his gaze returned to the masked man.</p><p>“Bazhun’an?”</p><p>The Voice of Nulan, the famed sword slave, was sheathed. He did not even raise his eyes as he shook his head and said, “I don’t believe you.”</p><p>The corners of the masked man’s mouth curled up. “You don’t dare to believe me, or you don’t want to believe me?”</p><p>“I don’t believe You!”</p><p>“You don’t believe me? Then why did you sheathe your famed sword, and why did you clear the arena?”</p><p>“Because…”</p><p>Gou Wuyue raised his eyes once again, and his eyes were filled with fervor. “I want to fight you one on one!”</p><p>“Hehe.”</p><p>“One on one?”</p><p>The masked man laughed. “Are you afraid that I’ll accidentally kill those people? Don’t worry, I don’t enjoy killing people now.”</p><p>“And…”</p><p>The masked man sized up Gou Wuyue, and a hint of mockery appeared in his turbid eyes. “You’re almost a demi-saint, and you still want to bully me, someone of just Acquired Realm?”</p><p>“Acquired Realm?”</p><p>Gou Wuyue laughed out loud. “Can Acquired Realm experts crush Cutting Path Level experts so easily? Chang Yi was brought up by me. I know his strength, so…”</p><p>He instantly changed the topic. “You’re sealing your sword?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
