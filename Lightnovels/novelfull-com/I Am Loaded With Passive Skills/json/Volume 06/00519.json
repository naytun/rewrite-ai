After all, it had nothing to do with him.</p><p>After observing that he was indeed out of danger and no Red Coat person was catching up to him, he once again found the place with the densest Way of the Heaven’s aura from the white bead map in his mind, which was the location of the Path Pattern Initial Stone.</p><p>What was worth mentioning was the location of this thing was very far away from the Spirit Fusion Swamp.</p><p>It was even somewhat close to the location of the large mass of devilish energy.</p><p>If nothing unexpected happened, it should only be the Fourth Sword</p><p>Without a doubt, even if one used one’s knees to think about it, one could foresee that the most powerful figures would almost always meet at the final stop of the Fourth Sword.</p><p>The large Red Coat army would definitely be at that place.</p><p>Could the Path Pattern Initial Stone be let go just like that?</p><p>In the past, Xu Xiaoshou did not have a choice and might have planned to give up.</p><p>But now, with the Vanishing Technique and Transformation, he was pressing forward!</p><p>Inside the barrier.</p><p>“Big Big Big… Big Brother Shou?”</p><p>The moment Fu Yinhong turned her head, Fu Xing also looked towards the place where the voice came from.</p><p>In the next second, his expression was as if he had seen a ghost. He was so shocked that he couldn’t even hold on to the spirit beast meat that he had just finished roasting and was about to fall into the bonfire.</p><p>“Freeze!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took large strides forward and used the high-level All Things are Swords to freeze the spirit beast meat in mid-air.</p><p>“Did you see a ghost? Why are you so flustered?”</p><p>“Tell me the truth. Are you secretly talking bad about me behind my back?”</p><p>As he spoke, his figure flashed and he directly appeared in front of Fu Xing. He picked up the spirit beast meat, took a bite, and tore it.</p><p>“Gulp!”</p><p>After not tasting meat for many days, he swallowed it in one mouthful and was satisfied.</p><p>“Your cooking is not bad, just a little worse than mine.” Xu Xiaoshou finished up all the meat in no time.</p><p>He threw the bone and the wooden branch into the fire.</p><p>Fu Xing’s little heart also jumped.</p><p>“This, this, this…”</p><p>He was completely dumbfounded.</p><p>How could it be such a coincidence?</p><p>He mentioned “Xiaoshou,” and Xiaoshou arrived?</p><p>He probably didn’t hear what he said just now!</p><p>He definitely didn’t hear it!</p><p>There was a protective barrier, how could he have heard it!</p><p>Darn it, he should have used telepathic communication just now…</p><p>“Big Big Big Brother Shou. Hehe, when did you come? You didn’t even inform me, I could have roasted meat for you!” Fu Xing squeezed out a smile.</p><p>“Just now.”</p><p>“Uh, just now, how long ago was it?” Fu Xing’s face twitched.</p><p>“Do you know what ‘just now’ means?” Xu Xiaoshou sat down next to him.</p><p>Mu Zixi and Yu Zhiwen also came to the bonfire. The two of them nodded to Fu Yinhong and sat on the ground.</p><p>“Cough Cough.”</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes, I really…”</p><p>“You’re acting weird.” Xu Xiaoshou looked at him with amusement. “Are you really talking bad about me behind my back? Are you afraid that I’ll hear you?”</p><p>Fu Xing looked at Xu Xiaoshou’s face and felt that he had learned face reading for nothing.</p><p>He could not tell whether Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth… expression was real or fake!</p><p>“It’s nothing. Don’t talk nonsense.”</p><p>“I just…”</p><p>His tone was long, and his eyes suddenly stopped on the protective spiritual array. “Yes, I’m just curious. The level of this spiritual array isn’t low either. How did you enter without us noticing?”</p><p>Fu Yinhong held her forehead with one hand and closed her eyes heavily.</p><p>What a silly brother!</p><p>Although you should still be in a coma when the Spirit Array Casters in the banquet room fought.</p><p>But that guy could even tamper with the spiritual array in the back garden, can’t you think straight?</p><p>What kind of nonsense were you asking!</p><p>“Hehe.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t say anything and chuckled twice.</p><p>Fu Xing panicked even more.</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Let’s get to know each other.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t tease him anymore. He pointed at Yu Zhiwen and said, “The Divine Sorceress from the Holy Divine Palace, Yu Zhiwen.”</p><p>“Your so-called high-level spiritual array is like paper in front of her.”</p><p>“You should practice more in the future.”</p><p>Then he pointed at Fu Xing and said to Yu Zhiwen, “Young Master Fu from the City Lord Mansion of Tiansang city, except for the fact that he looks a little worse than me, everything else about him is very outstanding.”</p><p>“He knows everything, but he is not good at anything, just like his spiritual array.”</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Hello.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen nodded and greeted.</p><p>Fu Xing quickly regained his senses and wanted to return the greeting.</p><p>However, when he swept his gaze over, it was the first time he noticed that the woman behind Xu Xiaoshou was so shockingly beautiful.</p><p>This pair of terrifying star eyes almost sucked his eyeballs out.</p><p>Fortunately, he only lost his composure for an instant, and Fu Xing quickly recovered.</p><p>He flung his sleeves and wiped his hands on his lapels before reaching out.</p><p>“Hello, Miss. I’m Fu Xing.”</p><p>“Pa.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held his hand and held his other hand. He pointed at Fu Yinhong and said, “His sister, Fu Yinhong.”</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>Seeing the two women nodding at each other, Fu Xing’s heart suddenly calmed down after this random introduction.</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>No matter how much he suspected, at least the Xu Xiaoshou in front of him was still the familiar Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>The ghost beast theory… it was just a guess.</p><p>Why was he so flustered before it even happened?</p><p>He took a deep breath and regained his composure.</p><p>“Big Brother Shou…”</p><p>“Hey, wait!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lifted Fu Xing’s hand and covered his mouth. “According to seniority, you can’t call me Big Brother Shou now.”</p><p>“You can change the way you address me, for example…”</p><p>“Uncle Shou.”</p><p>As he spoke, he turned to look at Fu Yinhong. “Right, niece?”</p><p>The corner of her lips twitched, and she nearly picked up a stone to throw at the young man’s face.</p><p>This was too infuriating!</p><p>How could this fellow stir up the anger of others so easily the moment he appeared!</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Cough cough…”</p><p>Fu Xing was also having a headache. Naturally, he knew about the relationship between Xu Xiaoshou and his father, so he chose to avoid addressing him.</p><p>“Come, come, come, have a sit.”</p><p>“To be able to meet again in the White Cave is fate. I’ll roast meat for everyone to eat.”</p><p>As he spoke, he hurriedly took out meat ingredients and seasoning from his ring and became a mute-like roast man.</p><p>“Little fellow, you’re quite clever.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled. He did not choose to barbecue with them. Instead, he stood up and said, “We’ll talk about the meat later. I’m not here to look for you guys.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Fu Xing shut his mouth and raised his head.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth flew into a rage. Everyone followed his gaze and saw the team from the Spirit Palace at the bonfire.</p><p>They had obviously noticed the commotion over there.</p><p>At this moment, the meat was no longer roasted.</p><p>There were a few people who stood up.</p><p>“Senior Sister Rao…” Mu Zixi muttered.</p><p>She said “Senior Sister Rao”, but her gaze landed on the young lady in white.</p><p>As expected, her Senior Brother looked over, and Su Qianqian’s dimples sunk in.</p><p>“Big Brother Shou!”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou walked over, Mu Zixi and Yu Zhiwen couldn’t sit still any longer and follow closely behind.</p><p>“There will be a good show to watch.”</p><p>Fu Xing mumbled, then suddenly paused. “No, it’s time to leave.”</p><p>“Leave for what?”</p><p>Fu Yinhong looked over with interest and said, “It’s not like we’re taking the initiative. We’re just watching the battle. What danger could there be?”</p><p>Seeing Fu Xing’s face darken, she immediately added, “Don’t you think that after just a few days of not seeing him, Xu Xiaoshou seems to have changed even more?”</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>Fu Xing was stunned. “Where?”</p><p>“Everywhere!”</p><p>Fu Yinhong frowned and said in puzzlement, “Moreover, even if it’s just his cultivation level, can you see through it now?”</p><p>“Cultivation level?”</p><p>Fu Xing glanced at the two of them suspiciously and his gaze landed on Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>It was as if he was surrounded by a dense mist.</p><p>Not to mention the cultivation level.</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou’s energy movement fluctuation was completely undetectable with just a glance.</p><p>How was this a spiritual cultivator?</p><p>If he was placed in a crowd, no one would say that he wasn’t an ordinary person!</p><p>But… was he ordinary?</p><p>Fu Xing hesitated.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou could be associated with the word “ordinary”.</p><p>All the talented people in the world would have become ordinary people!</p><p>“Or rather…”</p><p>“Return to the basics?”</p><p>“Watched, Passive Points, +13.”</p><p>“Hated On, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou came to the front of the Spirit Palace team. Looking at Su Qianqian, he couldn’t help but sigh.</p><p>This little girl…</p><p>In the end, she had changed.</p><p>If the tragic incident with the Su family hadn’t happened, she would still be that little girl from the Spirit Palace in the past, and she would be the first to pounce on him and hug him after not meeting for so long.</p><p>However, except for the slightly surprised “Big Brother Shou”.</p><p>He couldn’t see any other signs of joy on Su Qianqian’s face.</p><p>“Saint Servant…” Xu Xiaoshou narrowed his eyes.</p><p>Life always smoothed out the edges and corners of people.</p><p>Even if she wasn’t used to it, when the burden of responsibility fell on a person, no matter how difficult it was, she still had to shoulder it.</p><p>His gaze swept across the others.</p><p>Apart from a few familiar faces from the Spirit Palace, there were also some young people he didn’t know.</p><p>Judging from the location, they should be from the Su family.</p><p>In other words, Su Qianqian’s team had found the Spirit Palace’s main team in the White Cave and had come to this place together.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Suddenly, a rough and burly man who he didn’t know at all stood up. With a fierce expression, he walked up to everyone.</p><p>He pointed at the bonfire of Fu Xing and Fu Yinhong and said, “If you’re not looking for them, then you’re looking for me?”</p><p>He narrowed his eyes, and a murderous intent that was neither painful nor itchy came down from the sky.</p><p>“Questioned. Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Multiple question marks appeared on Xu Xiaoshou’s face.</p><p>He turned his head to look at the team from the Spirit Palace and found Zhou Tianshen behind this person who was continuously punching his palm and sending out some unknown signal.</p><p>Then he looked at Rao Yinyin who was standing with her arms crossed over her chest with a teasing look in her eyes.</p><p>In the end, he returned to this person.</p><p>“I’m sorry…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated. “Who are you?”</p><p>The killing intent in Tan Ji’s body suddenly froze, and the wild words that were about to come out of his mouth were stuck in his throat.</p><p>“Pfft.”</p><p>The Zhou Tianshen burst out laughing on the spot.</p><p>He clapped his hands while pointing at the rough and wild man and said happily,</p><p>“Hahaha, Tan Ji, I can’t believe something like that would happen to you.”</p><p>“As you’re a lousy temporary leader, I have told you not to be arrogant.”</p><p>“Great, now that Xu Xiaoshou is here, hurry up and step aside, or else you’ll have a hard time later!”</p><p>“Shut up!” Tan Ji couldn’t help but turn his head and berate him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face was immediately wrinkled.</p><p>“My friend… first of all, eavesdropping on other people’s conversations is impolite, even if my two good friends over there and I didn’t say anything important.” He pointed at Fu Xing.</p><p>“Secondly, I’m not here to look for you. You don’t have to be so agitated. I don’t like men.”</p><p>“Lastly, I can tell that you’re a very arrogant person, but please don’t talk to my good friends like that. It’s very displeasing.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gestured to Zhou Tianshen and his tone was very sincere.</p><p>He really couldn’t remember when he had offended this person.</p><p>Even though he had seen the conflict between the Zhou Tianshen and this person from afar, he didn’t intend to stand up for him.</p><p>After all, his target wasn’t a person.</p><p>It didn’t seem like Zhou Tianshen would like him to stand up for him.</p><p>But this fellow… Tan Ji?</p><p>You are only at the Peak of Innate Stage, and you don’t even have a Master Stage cultivation level. How did you have the guts to jump out and suppress me, Xu Xiaoshou, with a killing intent?</p><p>I, Xu Xiaoshou, won’t kill Innate Stage cultivators, alright?</p><p>He was still a rookie!</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Hearing Xu Xiaoshou’s words, Tan Ji laughed maniacally.</p><p>After laughing, he stopped. With a disdainful look in his eyes, he said, “Not happy? You, Xu Xiaoshou, came here for the leader position… sigh.”</p><p>“Go away.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stepped forward and placed a palm on Tan Ji’s right cheek, pushing him to the side.</p><p>“Rub rub rub rub.”</p><p>Tan Ji staggered and was pushed away just like that. In the end, he fell to the ground with a thud and he was stunned.</p><p>This power… something wasn’t right!</p><p>Holy crap! What did this guy do?</p><p>He turned his head and saw everyone standing high above him. With a backhand, he pinched the sand and stones on the ground.</p><p>Only then did he reacted.</p><p>He was slapped to the ground by Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Looking at everyone’s dumbfounded and disbelieving expressions, Tan Ji was about to go crazy.</p><p>Embarrassment and shame surged from his heart, and in an instant, his entire face turned red.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, how dare you launch a sneak attack?!”</p><p>He stood up angrily, wanting to regain some of the reputations he had lost from being knocked to the ground. Tan Ji pulled out his long spear and pointed the tip at Xu Xiaoshou. His killing intent exploded wantonly.</p><p>In an instant, the scene was filled with sand and gravel. The bonfire was quickly extinguished on the spot.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou went straight to Zhou Tianshen and frowned. “Your sworn enemy? I’ve only been gone for a short while. Are you that good at causing trouble?”</p><p>“My sworn enemy?”</p><p>Zhou Tianshen was stunned for a moment. “No, no, no. Not my sworn enemy. Your sworn enemy.”</p><p>“Me?” Xu Xiaoshou pointed at himself in disbelief.</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>Zhou Tianshen nodded. “You’re the second leader of the White Cave team appointed by the Dean. This guy is a temporary leader. Once you come over, the position of leader will change.”</p><p>“Now…”</p><p>As Zhou Tianshen spoke, he glanced behind Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He felt that it wasn’t very good to leave the guy behind who had shot out his spear like a dragon.</p><p>Looking at that fellow, his face was ashen.</p><p>He didn’t know if he was stifled or angry.</p><p>But… if Xu Xiaoshou didn’t care, what was there to be afraid of?</p><p>“Now that you’re here, this fellow’s position as the team leader is gone. Naturally, he wants to challenge you.” Zhou Tianshen returned to his senses and pretended as if nothing had happened.</p><p>“What do you mean by team leader?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sneered, “I’m not going to accept such an arduous task. The Dean is just trying to oppress me…”</p><p>“Yes, that’s right. Is there a salary for this job?” His expression suddenly changed.</p><p>“Salary?”</p><p>“Uh, I mean reward.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“No?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his voice and said in surprise, “What kind of joke is this! Protecting so many people without a reward, which idiot would do it?”</p><p>Rao Yinyin was stunned for a moment.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!” Tan Ji roared.</p><p>His eyes were spitting fire and were filled with madness. He looked like a madman.</p><p>Seeing the two people in front of him chatting like there was no one else around, there was even a hint of innuendo in their words.</p><p>What was this?</p><p>How could you disregard me, Tan Ji?</p><p>What about the long spear that I pulled out?</p><p>How dare you ignore it?</p><p>Tan Ji was so angry that his teeth were chattering.</p><p>Do you have the qualifications to disregard me, Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>He raised the long spear and shook it. Spiritual source enveloped the body of the spear, and it directly transformed into a yellow dragon that smashed towards the clear sky.</p><p>Boundless energy exploded out from his body, causing the bonfire to fly in all directions with crackling sounds, and sparks flew in all directions.</p><p>Everyone retreated with thumping sounds, and they looked at this crazy fellow with astonished expressions.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>“He even used the Green and Yellow Dragon Spear. It can’t be that serious, right?”</p><p>“Although Tan Ji is a little arrogant, would he dare to kill his own people?”</p><p>“Has he gone crazy?”</p><p>“I don’t think so. He’s probably using his fake craziness to take someone’s life. When the time comes, he’ll ‘timely’ stop and repent, and the matter will be over.”</p><p>With the strength of retreating, everyone discussed in low voices.</p><p>Even Rao Yinyin was a little anxious when she saw this scene.</p><p>However, Tan Ji charged forward like a madman, and Xu Xiaoshou was still unmoved.</p><p>“What does he want to do?”</p><p>“When this guy left the Spirit Palace, he was only at the Origin Court State. It can’t be that he really didn’t notice anything, right?”</p><p>With this thought in mind, Rao Yinyin quickly denied herself.</p><p>Only a fool would believe that a guy who could obtain eighteen White Cave quota in the City Lord Mansion would not notice this awe-inspiring killing intent.</p><p>“Let’s see first.”</p><p>Temporarily suppressing the impulse to stop this battle, Rao Yinyin suddenly wanted to see how Xu Xiaoshou would break the situation.</p><p>“Be careful…”</p><p>Zhou Tianshen had just recovered from Xu Xiaoshou’s words but when he saw Tan Ji coming over with a spear, he could not help but remind him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, however, patted his butt indifferently and suddenly sat down.</p><p>Coincidentally, after this action, the long spear that was pointed at his back pierced through the area above his shoulder.</p><p>He did not seem to be disturbed at all. He asked, “Tell me, how did you contact each other after you came to the White Cave?”</p><p>“I didn’t know that this place had a random teleportation, so I had to search for someone or spread my spiritual senses all over the White Cave before I could find them.”</p><p>Right above.</p><p>“Darn you!”</p><p>Tan Ji realized that what he had pierced through with his spear was just an illusion and he was burning with anger.</p><p>When he came back to his senses, Xu Xiaoshou had already sat down on the ground.</p><p>He was unharmed.</p><p>In an instant, Tan Ji’s eyes were about to pop out of their sockets, and his lungs were about to explode from anger.</p><p>“You’re pretending again! How dare you pretend in front of me?”</p><p>He stopped his spear in mid-air, retracted his hand, and pressed it down. Using the momentum, he directly somersaulted into the air.</p><p>Following that, taking advantage of the fact that he had swung his spear in a full round, and the pressure of the air was so great that it was about to explode from the sound, Tan Ji fiercely whipped it down.</p><p>“What the heck!”</p><p>“Die for me!”</p><p>“Pu Pu Pu –”</p><p>The air was directly blown up.</p><p>The long spear turned into a shadow and smashed down on his head.</p><p>“Gulp.”</p><p>Zhou Tianshen tried his best not to raise his head.</p><p>However, as he felt the crazy state of the air being compressed repeatedly, he could not help but swallow a mouthful of saliva.</p><p>However, when he looked at Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>He was indifferent.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou still chose to ignore him.</p><p>“What a guy!”</p><p>At this moment, Zhou Tianshen was full of pride. He wasn’t the one fighting, but he felt the same way and his blood was boiling.</p><p>He completely ignored the commotion above him and tried his best to remain calm.</p><p>He waved his hand.</p><p>Then, like a pea shooter who had his speed increased by ten times, he said continuously,</p><p>“The Dean has a self-made thing called the Connection Jade. As long as you take this thing, forget about the White Cave, you can contact your teammates in any secret realm in the world… be careful!”</p><p>He could not help but raise his head and exclaim.</p><p>The spear was about to hit his head!</p><p>“Oh, I see.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was pulled over and slightly tilted his butt.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, he gathered the firewood that had been blown away earlier.</p><p>Then, he released the fire seed and ignited the white flame.</p><p>“Eat while you talk. My culinary skills are awesome, and I’m proficient in barbecuing meat. Let me show you something.” He patted Zhou Tianshen’s shoulder.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The ground was directly blasted apart by the long spear.</p><p>The terrifying spiritual energy layer exploded in the shape of a ripple from the side of his buttocks, instantly sweeping in all directions.</p><p>The surrounding crowd had already hidden more than a hundred feet away.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou had only moved half of his buttocks.</p><p>“Darn!”</p><p>Zhou Tianshen cried out in surprise, and his body subconsciously tilted to the side.</p><p>However, when dust flew everywhere, only then did he realize that he had landed at the center of the battle and was actually unharmed.</p><p>“This, this, this…”</p><p>His eyes instantly opened wide, and his eyebrows almost rose to the back of his head.</p><p>Brother, can you calm down?</p><p>Even if you don’t want your life, I, Old Zhou, still want it!</p><p>By the way, how did you manage to protect me?</p><p>“When… did… did you, you, learned how to barbecue?” He couldn’t even speak fluently.</p><p>“Darn you…”</p><p>In the sky, Tan Ji was completely dumbfounded.</p><p>Was this… a coincidence?</p><p>Why did he feel that he was a little bit off?</p><p>Speaking of which…</p><p>Even if these two people weren’t hit, why were they completely fine after being struck by the spiritual essence?</p><p>“Is everything I knock out air?”</p><p>At this moment, he even started to doubt himself.</p><p>“Die, die, die, die!”</p><p>However, when he saw that these two people had ignored him once again and started roasting meat in the center of the explosion, they even successfully started a fire…</p><p>Tan Ji exploded, he grimaced and couldn’t care less about the rules of the Spirit Palace anymore.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>“All of you die!”</p><p>The long spear was pulled upward fiercely.</p><p>Tan Ji suddenly staggered backward because the spearhead seemed to be held by something and couldn’t be pulled out at all.</p><p>“This?”</p><p>He narrowed his eyes, and only then did he see Xu Xiaoshou pressing the other half of his butt on his spearhead again.</p><p>“What are you arguing about? You are so annoying!”</p><p>“I’m talking to a friend, and you’re buzzing like a mosquito. Don’t you have any sense of civic-mindedness?”</p><p>“This is a public place!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally turned around. He slapped his hand on the ground, and the spearhead was jolted up.</p><p>He did not avoid the sharp tip at all and grabbed the spearhead and pulled it in his direction. Tan Ji felt a huge force that had knocked him down earlier reappear.</p><p>There was no room for resistance!</p><p>“Wu.”</p><p>He grunted and his entire body was about to pounce into Xu Xiaoshou’s embrace.</p><p>The scene seemed to freeze in this frame.</p><p>As his pupils constricted, he could vaguely see Xu Xiaoshou turning his head, and his faintly contained eyes suddenly widened in anger.</p><p>“Scram.”</p><p>Just one word and there was not the slightest movement.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The area within a radius of a hundred feet collapsed three feet.</p><p>Tan Ji seemed to have seen a giant stepping down.</p><p>That destructive aura had yet to land on his body, and the rest of the force was not something he could withstand.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Blood splattered.</p><p>The figure that pounced over directly bounced in the air, and as if it was hit by a heavy hammer, it flew up into the sky.</p><p>“Ding –“</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
