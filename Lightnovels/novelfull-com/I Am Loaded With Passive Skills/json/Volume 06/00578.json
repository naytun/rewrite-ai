His eyes were white, and he had a pair of dead fish eyes. He used his “Perception”to watch as Aje continued to absorb the demonic aura in his body.</p><p>This process of absorption lasted for a full half a minute.</p><p>Finally, the black energy in his body, which was so full that it was about to explode, was slightly weakened, and he could barely regain a bit of consciousness.</p><p>“I, I’m saved?”</p><p>He looked around.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw the three terrifying figures huddled together in the distance.</p><p>Saint servant, a group of three!</p><p>Who could withstand this?</p><p>If he hadn’t used Aje’s explosive attack at the critical moment to directly use the vanishing technique to remove the restriction of the Fourth Sword..</p><p>If he hadn’t only used the vanishing technique to activate and remove the two states, he wouldn’t have had to unconsciously maintain his disappearing state..</p><p>If not for the fact that the real target of the Fourth Sword was not him, but instead, it was crazily trying to attack the body of the Saint Servant’s chief..</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou dared to assert.</p><p>At this moment, he would be either dead or out of control.</p><p>Or perhaps, he would end up with the most terrifying outcome — being targeted by the Saint Servant’s chief and the storyteller at the same time!</p><p>“Oh, my sin…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not imagine why his trip to the white cave was so difficult.</p><p>As expected, the source of all this was still the overwhelming confidence after he had swallowed the Infernal Original Seed and the Three Days Frozen Calamity?</p><p>If he hadn’t thought about the Fourth Sword at that time and the mission that Elder Sang gave him that even he didn’t care about..</p><p>“I’m tired.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt very tired.</p><p>Even the old man must have expected the result of fighting for the Fourth Sword.</p><p>Why was he so naive to take the first step to the Lijian Grassland?</p><p>That was the path to the Abyss!</p><p>“Hide, hide.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wanted to take a step to the sky and escape from this place, but he didn’t dare to do so.</p><p>God knew if the storyteller would be very cautious and banish this space when he arrived here.</p><p>If that was the case, not only would he not be able to take the easy way out, he would even expose his position to the perverted man in the red dress when he reached the critical point.</p><p>If that was the case..</p><p>“Hide well!”</p><p>Holding Aje, Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to think too much.</p><p>Sensing that the demonic aura in his body was gradually decreasing and that it was basically difficult to affect his movements, he lowered his head and directly went underground.</p><p>..</p><p>He finished off his negative state in front of the Saint Servant’s group of three. Even with the vanishing technique, Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was still beating wildly.</p><p>While he was underground, he heard the Saint Servant’s chief pay all his attention to the so-called “Wen Ming”that he had announced earlier.</p><p>“The sword has already arrived. where is the Wen Ming you mentioned?”</p><p>As soon as the masked man finished speaking, the storyteller’s reaction was obviously stunned.</p><p>“Yes, where is he?”</p><p>He turned his head to glance at the Fourth Sword and said hesitantly, “In theory, with the Fourth Sword under Wen Ming’s control, he won’t let go easily. It’s impossible for Wen Ming to give up on this vicious sword.”</p><p>“After all, he’s also an ancient swordsman, right?”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>The storyteller paused and Cen Qiaofu immediately continued, “But with the Fourth Sword in this state, can he let go?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The storyteller nodded and frowned, “So, he should already have let go of the Fourth Sword earlier? But how could he be aware of the unusual movements of the Fourth Sword?”</p><p>“What’s Wen Ming’s cultivation level?”Cen Qiaofu suddenly asked.</p><p>“Around Innate stage.”</p><p>“Yes, Innate…”</p><p>“Yes? Innate? !”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s tone changed and he turned his head to look at the turbulent world of the White Cave far away.</p><p>The explosion started there.</p><p>And by the previous storyteller’s words, the movements were caused by the so-called Wen Ming.</p><p>“Are you sure that he is only at the Innate stage?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu asked again, his tone was full of doubt.</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>The storyteller froze for a moment. He also turned his head to look at the movement behind him and said submissively, “Yes… I think?”</p><p>Seeing the disbelief on Cen Qiaofu’s face, the storyteller added, “In short, he’s not strong. He’s around Innate. At most, he’s only at the Grandmaster realm. But his fighting strength should be comparable to… The Sovereign stage ?”His voice became softer and softer.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s face darkened.</p><p>The storyteller had a headache, but he had no choice but to continue, “If we add in some external forces, even if we encounter the Cutting Path… well, I’m referring to the various restrictions in the white cave world, so…”</p><p>“?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu slowly asked a question mark.</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>The storyteller wiped his sweat. He knew how unbelievable his words were, but he still insisted on finishing.</p><p>“So, under all kinds of restrictions, Wen Ming should be able to fight against someone of the Cutting Path stage…”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s face turned from black to green.</p><p>“Are you serious?”</p><p>“I’m serious.”</p><p>“You’re not joking?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Is this what you mean by ‘not strong in any case’?”Cen Qiaofu’s eyes almost popped out.</p><p>“Phew”</p><p>The storyteller heaved a sigh of relief. “You’ll know once you fight with him. This kid is a little strange.”</p><p>As he spoke, he turned to look at his brother. “Is that right?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu also turned his gaze over.</p><p>He did not know why the chief valued that Wen Ming so much in the past.</p><p>Even the Holy Emperor used that guy as a chess piece in his scheme.</p><p>But now, if all of this wasn’t exaggerated..</p><p>“He’s not a Grandmaster.”</p><p>The masked man said, “When I first met him, he should only be in the Acquired realm. It’s only been a few months? Has he reached the Grandmaster level in a month?”</p><p>“No matter how talented he is, he wouldn’t be able to directly comprehend the Heavenly Image state and reach the Grandmaster stage.”</p><p>“In theory, it’s already pretty good that Wen Ming has reached the Innate Origin Court level or Occupied Void at this time.”</p><p>“Of course, we can’t rule out the possibility that he has some opportunities to reach the Upper Spirit…”</p><p>“Hmm? What’s with your expression?”</p><p>As the masked man spoke, he saw Cen Qiaofu’s strange expression.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s jaw couldn’t close anymore.</p><p>“That hedgehog, Upper Spirit level, can he make such a big commotion?”He pointed at the shattered space behind him.</p><p>“Upper Spirit, it’s just a conjecture,”the masked man said.</p><p>“Are you missing the main point? What I mean… is not this!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu said as he looked at the storyteller and roared:</p><p>“A mere Innate expert can achieve such a level?”</p><p>“Comparable to Cutting Path Stage?”</p><p>“What kind of joke are you making? !”</p><p>“He’s not joking.”The storyteller was silent for a moment before saying, “He has a divine puppet on him.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>This time, not only Cen Qiaofu was stunned, even the masked man was shocked.</p><p>“Divine puppet?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>The storyteller nodded and said, “A divine puppet that doesn’t look like a divine puppet…”</p><p>“Wait.”</p><p>The masked man suddenly reached out and interrupted the storyteller. When the two people in front of him looked over, he said, “Is the divine puppet you’re talking about not in human form?”</p><p>“You know?”The storyteller was surprised.</p><p>“Little Boy?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>“Bald?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>“Very weak?”</p><p>“That’s right… Err, it can’t be said that it’s very weak, right?”</p><p>The storyteller’s excited thoughts calmed down and he explained, “It’s weaker than a normal divine puppet. It only has the battle consciousness of the first level, but it’s very strange, as if…”</p><p>“Like a real person?”The masked man spoke again.</p><p>“Yes, yes, that’s the feeling!”</p><p>The storyteller nodded crazily and said, “If it wasn’t for the fact that it didn’t have any human vital signs, I would have been fooled. If I glanced at it, I definitely wouldn’t be able to tell that it was a heartless divine puppet.”</p><p>“Understood.”</p><p>The masked man fell silent.</p><p>The storyteller raised his eyebrows and glanced at Cen Qiaofu. Seeing him shrug his shoulders, he immediately understood that this old man was also confused.</p><p>He could only ask himself, “Brother, do you know it?”</p><p>“I don’t think so. We met once… No, twice. I think.”</p><p>A hint of memory appeared in the masked man’s turbid eyes as he said slowly,</p><p>“The first generation divine puppet, a defective product that Dao Qiongcang self-proclaimed. If I remember correctly, it was thrown into the Abyss Island.”</p><p>“At that time, it seemed to have no consciousness.”</p><p>“But the second time we met, it had already given birth to spiritual intelligence and seemed to be able to grow on its own.”</p><p>“It was very strange and dangerous.”</p><p>“In the end, it seemed to have been destroyed by White-clothed in the Abyss Island twice.”</p><p>The two spectators were speechless for a moment.</p><p>Divine puppet, giving birth to spiritual intelligence, destroying it twice?</p><p>“It’s obviously very strong, why don’t you use it?”Cen Qiaofu felt that something wasn’t right. This didn’t seem like something stupid that the holy divine palace would do.</p><p>“It is strong, but there’s no upper limit.”</p><p>The masked man shot him a meaningful glance. “If you can’t truly control what’s in your hands, do you think those people will keep it?”</p><p>“But according to Dao Qiongcang’s personality…”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu was anxious.</p><p>He absolutely did not believe that the Great Hallmaster Dao, who was addicted to the Divine Secret technique, would give up such a good research opportunity.</p><p>The masked man smiled and shook his head, interrupting him.</p><p>“The group of people I’m talking about is not that group of people, but “that” group of people.”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu froze for a moment.</p><p>The storyteller’s pupils constricted. He seemed to have thought of something as he shuddered and a cold air seeped through his body.</p><p>..</p><p>“Which group of people?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was deep underground, was immediately confused by these words.</p><p>From the tone of these words, the legendary Hallmaster Dao should have wanted to keep Aje.</p><p>But, he was stopped?</p><p>How was that possible?</p><p>Wasn’t the peak of this world the Holy Divine Palace and its current hallmaster, Dao Qiongcang?</p><p>Was he stopped from researching?</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>Aje suddenly murmured.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou jumped in fright and immediately clenched the stone-shaped iron ball.</p><p>“Don’t make a sound. They’re not talking about you. Don’t be afraid, Be good!”</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>AJE seemed to be in a bad mood.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could completely understand.</p><p>If he didn’t use the vanishing technique to hide underground, he might not even know about these secrets.</p><p>However, why would Aje, who was supposed to be destroyed on the Abyss Island, appear in Tianxuan Gate of Tiansang Spirit Palace?</p><p>“Elder Sang?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately thought of such a person.</p><p>The masked man said that he had seen Aje before. could he have gone to the Abyss Island with Elder Sang, the second-in-command of the Saint Servant?</p><p>That did not seem right!</p><p>If the two of them had gone together, there was no reason for Aje to appear in a small place like Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>He should have fallen into a large organization like the Saint Servant and been fully utilized.</p><p>Moreover..</p><p>“Abyss Island?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought about it and suddenly remembered something.</p><p>He vaguely remembered Caramel’s words.</p><p>Abyss Island, wasn’t it that terrifying place that seemed to seal a Saint?</p><p>If nothing went wrong, the crack in the extradimensional space here was created by the wretched Saint, which was the crack leading to Abyss Island.</p><p>Among them..</p><p>“Oh my god!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that his mind was going to be in a mess.</p><p>When all these things were combined, it was extremely terrifying.</p><p>When he didn’t know everything, he still felt that this world was wonderful.</p><p>However, every time he knew a little bit more and understood more secrets, Xu Xiaoshou always felt a sense of panic.</p><p>Why did it seem like everything was related to me, Xu Xiaoshou, and was targeted at me, Xu Xiaoshou… ?</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>“Hey hey, it’s fine, it’s fine. Don’t worry, Ma Ma won’t abandon you.”</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou heard Aje’s muttering, he immediately hugged the poor little fellow even tighter.</p><p>He was afraid that if it couldn’t help but fly out and be exposed, then the matter would be..</p><p>Big Trouble!</p><p>..</p><p>“Oh right, there’s another matter that I’m more concerned about,”the storyteller said hesitantly.</p><p>“Speak.”</p><p>“Wen Ming, is he second brother’s disciple?”</p><p>The masked man was stunned, “How do you know?”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The storyteller recalled the scene of him being teased in the ancient book’s space. His face turned red and he found it difficult to speak.</p><p>“It’s a long story, so I won’t go into details.”</p><p>“I just want to know, where exactly did second brother go when he disappeared?”</p><p>The masked man smiled, “You already know the answer, why are you asking me?”</p><p>“So, it really is…”the storyteller could not believe it, but he could not continue.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu laughed and shook his head, recalling the “Dragon Melting realm”of Elder Sang from the Spirit Palace.</p><p>To be honest.</p><p>If he had not followed the chief to the Spirit Palace, he would not have imagined that Elder Sang would go to such a remote place.</p><p>“For that Wen Ming?”Cen Qiaofu asked.</p><p>Other than this explanation, he could not imagine why Elder Sang would go to such a place.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>The masked man shook his head.</p><p>“Wen Ming was just an accident. Second Brother did not stay in Tiansang Spirit Palace much. He went back this time just to stop my plan and not let the famed sword fall.”</p><p>“But it was useless.”</p><p>Masked man laughed and continued, “More importantly, it’s a plan.”</p><p>“What phlan?” The Storyteller asked curiously.</p><p>The masked man casually glanced behind him and said, “It’s done.”</p><p>Both of them looked back at the same time.</p><p>The Void was nameless, and there was no other existence.</p><p>But they knew that in this space, there was an extradimensional space crack that led to Abyss Island.</p><p>It was invisible to the naked eye.</p><p>“Then there’s one more thing…”</p><p>The storyteller understood. He rolled his eyes and a happy expression appeared on his face. Then, he squeezed out a flattering smile as if he wanted to say something.</p><p>“Wait a minute.”</p><p>Seeing this, the masked man knew that it was not a good thing. He stopped him and looked around.</p><p>Then, he lowered his head and looked at the ground.</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>“I keep feeling that something is wrong…”</p><p>“You really only brought one sword?”</p><p>The masked man looked at the storyteller in confusion.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>The storyteller glanced at the Fourth Sword that was still floating behind him and said hesitantly, “Wen Ming came?”</p><p>“It’s not Wen Ming…”</p><p>The masked man curled his hand that was wrapped tightly in a black glove. He twisted his wrist to shake off the discomfort and said, “But it’s not just the Fourth Sword.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>The storyteller and Cen Qiaofu spoke at the same time.</p><p>The masked man was a little uncertain and his gaze was hesitant.</p><p>“Is it an illusion? I keep feeling that there’s the aura of a famed sword at the scene…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
