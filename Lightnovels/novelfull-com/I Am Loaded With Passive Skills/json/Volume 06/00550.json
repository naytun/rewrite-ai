How could the White Cave explode?”</p><p>“Could it be that all the Red Coats have arrived at the Lijian Grassland, and there are stowaways above the Sovereign Stage fighting outside, thus destroying the White Cave?”</p><p>“No, no!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was panicking.</p><p>It was the first time he was so powerless.</p><p>However, seeing as there was no help around, he could only force himself to calm down again and again.</p><p>If he were to lose control of his situation at this time, then there would really be nothing left.</p><p>“I must survive!”</p><p>There was not a moment when Xu Xiaoshou’s will to survive was so resolute.</p><p>This will even surpassed his desire to escape from this place.</p><p>“Calm down. It’s impossible for the White Cave to be gone. Not too long ago, the Night Guardian had just entered from the outside.”</p><p>“If the White Cave really exploded, he would either have died in the spatial fragment, or had broken through space and arrived outside the White Cave.”</p><p>“How is this possible? How could he have arrived in such a timely manner?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had discovered a blind spot.</p><p>Although the outside of the Heaven-Sealing Array was filled with spatial fragments, this did not mean that the White Cave was gone.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had actually seen a familiar scene before.</p><p>“But… That’s impossible!”</p><p>However, when he thought of that possibility, Xu Xiaoshou nearly went crazy.</p><p>How similar was all of this to the scene of the explosion of the ancient book space?</p><p>At that time, space itself had exploded. Xu Xiaoshou even had the intention to test the the grey mist figure’s heart, so he had actually been lost in the spatial fragment for quite some time.</p><p>Now, putting aside the unhappiness of this past battle.</p><p>Wasn’t the Lijian Grassland very similar to the ancient book space on the eve of the world’s destruction?</p><p>However, instead of the Spirit Fusion Swamp, it was the Lijian Grassland this time.</p><p>“Storyteller…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought about the Storyteller. From the beginning, the Storyteller was always calm, steady and stable. Xu Xiaoshou was almost overwhelmed.</p><p>“That’s right!”</p><p>“So, he has already started!”</p><p>“Everything that has happened so far is not in the White Cave at all, but in the Storyteller’s ancient book space!”</p><p>“He knows how to make copies!”</p><p>“Yes, his ability is to copy everything, including the terrain, including the Way of the Heavens…”</p><p>“He can finish a complete copy of the Spirit Fusion Swamp and move it into the ancient book space. Then, he can copy an image of the Lijian Grassland here. When everyone’s attention is focused on another place…”</p><p>“He’ll move in?”</p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Xiaoshou was so terrified that his knees went soft.</p><p>He tried hard to suppress the impulse to collapse on the spot, forcing himself to look as if nothing had happened. It didn’t matter at all.</p><p>“This is the only explanation left.”</p><p>“When the battle between the Red Coats and ghost beasts began, the Red Coat had no time to contact the outside world. The Storyteller had already made his move. He cut off the space and secretly moved everything.”</p><p>“And Red Coat, who was tied down by the ghost beast and couldn’t even handle the internal affairs of the great array, had no time to pay attention to the world outside of the great array.”</p><p>“When the Red Coasts finished dealing with the ghost beast and wanted to descend the great array, they realized that they were already captured!”</p><p>“At that time, Red Coat, who was exhausted from the battle and couldn’t even contact the outside world for help. There was no way to resist the Saint Servant or the Storyteller!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was terrified.</p><p>He was a chess player!</p><p>He was a true manipulator!</p><p>Under the circumstances where no one noticed, the Storyteller turned them into his own chess pieces and then kept himself out of it, quietly watching the chess pieces in the game fight.</p><p>The two armies were destroyed, and those who were eliminated died.</p><p>And those who entered the game, there was no way they could break out of the situation even if they could survive until the end.</p><p>It was fine if their strength didn’t match up, but even their strategic levels weren’t in the same league!</p><p>This was definitely a situation of being toyed with by others without even realizing it!</p><p>“Damn it…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou once again spoke to his master, Elder Sang, and had another opinion.</p><p>This world was really too terrifying.</p><p>These people weren’t people he could go up against at the moment.</p><p>He, Xu Xiaoshou, was a rather clever.</p><p>But compared to the Storyteller’s elaborate plan, saying that Xu Xiaoshou was more than humiliated was not enough to describe all of this.</p><p>“I’ll kneel in front of you, okay?”</p><p>“My whole damned mindset is exploding!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his hand as calmly as he could toward the Cardinal Wheel.</p><p>It was useless to struggle.</p><p>At this time, the only way to save himself was..</p><p>To get on his good side!</p><p>To get on the good side of the Storyteller!</p><p>At this moment, he was still Elder Sang, and the Storyteller respected him enough as long as he used him well.</p><p>It might not be difficult to get out.</p><p>But after getting out..</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s scalp went numb.</p><p>He had no way to break out of this situation.</p><p>Forget it, he would just have to adapt to the situation after getting out.</p><p>At this time, how could he think so far ahead?</p><p>“That’s not right.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had been forcing himself to calm down, suddenly came to a realization. The Storyteller could toy with everyone. Wouldn’t the Storyteller be able to see through Xu Xiaoshou’s little trick of disguising himself as the second-in-command of the Saint Servant?</p><p>Thump, thump, thump..</p><p>His heart suddenly thumped wildly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou instantly felt like a clown, directing and acting in front of others naked. He even shamelessly thought that in the eyes of others, he was actually beautiful and well-dressed.</p><p>Little did he know that it was just like the story of the emperor’s new outfit.</p><p>“No, no, there’s still some hope.”</p><p>“If this man in the red dress recognized me and scolded me like that, why didn’t he do anything?”</p><p>“Moreover, his reaction was nothing but ‘curse’ and ‘hate’…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was already full of self-doubt.</p><p>But at this moment, he had no choice but to believe in his own passive skill.</p><p>Even Mu Zixi couldn’t find any fault with the divine “transformation” skill.</p><p>Unless the Storyteller was a close friend who spent day and night with Elder Sang…</p><p>Otherwise, it wasn’t realistic to see through his true identity.</p><p>“Then, could they be close friends?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that the possibility wasn’t high.</p><p>He had met the Storyteller a few times.</p><p>The Storyteller wasn’t close in age to Elder Sang. He was just a young man.</p><p>Moreover, Elder Sang had a violent temper. If anyone, let alone a man, were to speak in such a delicate manner in front of him…</p><p>“Phew.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. The Storyteller could not tell.</p><p>Taking a step back, even if the facade was seen through, he had to continue acting.</p><p>Because there was no other way.</p><p>“Life is like a play. It all depends on acting skills…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed with tears in his eyes.</p><p>He pulled out the Ji sword and threw the cardinal wheel into Yuan mansion. Then, he took out a straw hat from his ring and put it on with one hand, covering his slightly bald head.</p><p>“Old Seven.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>The Storyteller’s voice immediately came over.</p><p>He was very curious.</p><p>There was not the slightest bit of worry about the battle situation.</p><p>At this time, Xu Xiaoshou already understood why.</p><p>He raised the Ji Sword in his hand, flicked his finger, and the sonorous sword cries reverberated underground.</p><p>The Ji Sword softened.</p><p>But under Xu Xiaoshou’s stern gaze, which was as if he wanted to eat someone alive, it hardened slightly.</p><p>“You said earlier that you have a strategy?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“Mmm-hmm?”</p><p>The storyteller did not understand what was going on, and his voice suddenly became a little more excited.</p><p>“Second Brother, are you willing to cooperate with me?”</p><p>“I damned well can’t!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou roared in his heart, but did he dare to say no? Could he say no?</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded his head emotionlessly as he looked at the battle situation.</p><p>Xin Gugu’s ability was very strange. He was attacked by Xin and many Red Coats and was directly dismembered.</p><p>However, he was split into four parts.</p><p>The four bloodied minotaurs seemed to be risking their lives as they attacked the Red Coat time and time again.</p><p>The people on the other side could see that this was going to be a big headache for them.</p><p>They couldn’t kill him, and he was dismembered and disintegrated. He was simply here to disgust them.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou could see that with the support of the great array, Xin Gugu, whose combat power was also divided into four, couldn’t deal any effective damage anymore.</p><p>It was only a matter of time before he was taken down.</p><p>As for Cheng Xingchu…</p><p>Well, it should be said that he was the Holy War Black Angel.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could no longer sense the slightest bit of Cheng Xingchu’s consciousness from the super ghost beast whose strength was constantly rising.</p><p>He was dead.</p><p>However, he had changed to another form and held Fourth Sword. Even with the cooperation of Lan Ling and Heiming, he was pulled into the gates of the Netherworld Corpse Hell.</p><p>Yet, he broke the spell with one sword!</p><p>When he came out again, his aura had reached the Cutting Path Stage. He was practically invincible!</p><p>“I’ve stalled him, but once Xin Gugu is taken down, the Holy War Black Angel will be exhausted.The ghost beast host body Cheng Xingchu is indeed a little weak.”</p><p>“It’s not enough to face Lan Ling, Heiming, and Xin at the same time.”</p><p>“And Night Guardian…”</p><p>This was a character that Xu Xiaoshou was very wary of.</p><p>He did not seem to be an ordinary Red Coat. He had even beaten the Storyteller into ice crystals once before.</p><p>At this moment, Night Guardian, who was searching for Caramel, had locked onto a certain location. He had even shattered the spatial fragment and darted into it, wanting to find out who the mastermind of Xu Yue Grey Palace was.</p><p>“It’s simply terrifying!”</p><p>However, none of this was important.</p><p>“Old Seven, do you think you can still hide?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>The storyteller was shocked.</p><p>With just this sentence, he knew that his little trick of inviting Second Brother into the ancient book space had been discovered.</p><p>However, it was very normal for Second Brother to be able to see through his trick.</p><p>And the meaning behind this sentence..</p><p>Had Red Coat discovered it too?</p><p>The storyteller hurriedly gathered his spiritual senses beside Lan Ling.</p><p>However, the group of people there were calm orderly. There was not the slightest fluctuation in their expressions. It was as if they had not discovered anything.</p><p>“Second Brother, what you mean is…”</p><p>“Red Coat is not as simple as you think.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said slowly, “Although you’ve blocked the way of the Divine Force, causing Red Coat to be unable to find me, they only need to sense that someone nearby is interfering with the Divine Secret. That’s enough.”</p><p>“The few of you came in too obviously. Red Coat has long known about it.”</p><p>“At this time, even if you randomly match your combat strength, they’ll know clearly that either you’re here or the Saint Servant’s group of three are all here.”</p><p>“The only person in the White Cave who can still hide his identity is me.”</p><p>The channel that the storyteller used to communicate with his spiritual senses was slightly unstable.</p><p>Obviously, the Storyteller had listened to what Xu Xiaoshou said.</p><p>“So?”</p><p>However, the Storyteller still managed to question calmly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but laugh and shake his head.</p><p>This fellow…</p><p>Obviously, the storyteller wasn’t stupid, he just hadn’t thought of this.</p><p>He was simply too arrogant. He did not pay attention to Red Coat at all.</p><p>However, was what he was going to face next only Red Coat?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said in a tone that reminded the Storyteller, “From the beginning until now, the combat strength that Red Coat has displayed is quite average.”</p><p>“Even when they encountered the Holy War Black Angel, they did not use any other forces.”</p><p>“That means that the forces they displayed in the Lijian Grassland are all they have.”</p><p>“At this time, do you think that they can spare the extra energy to deal with us while dealing with the Xu Yue Grey Palace?”</p><p>“Of course not.” The Storyteller was suddenly in high spirits.</p><p>In his plan, he was the going to reap the ultimate benefit when both sides suffered in their fighting</p><p>What could the Red Coat use to resist?</p><p>“Then what does Red Coat need to do after knowing about our existence and not having extra energy?” Xu Xiaoshou was disappointed.</p><p>“You mean…”</p><p>The Storyteller was shocked. His thoughts were suddenly and he said, “Contact the outside world?”</p><p>“No, they’re like caged birds They don’t even know what’s happening to them.”</p><p>The shocked voice was immediately suppressed, and the Storyteller’s tone instantly turned into one filled with ridicule.</p><p>“Second Brother, I have to say that your brain is indeed better than theirs, but even if they found out, so what?”</p><p>“Within the ancient book space, there’s no way to contact the outside world.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed in his heart.</p><p>It was as expected.</p><p>His speculation came true!</p><p>This area of the Lijian Grassland was a copy made by the sSoryteller.</p><p>Everyone had fallen into an huge intagible net.</p><p>He didn’t show it. Instead, he cursed angrily:</p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>“Red Coat can’t contact the outside world. What if the outside world can’t contact them?”</p><p>“You should know…”</p><p>“That old dog?!” The Storyteller suddenly yelled. Apparently, he had completely understood.</p><p>What if Gou Wuyue realized something was wrong and cut off White Cave with a single sword?</p><p>His brother and the others had not come out yet.</p><p>When that time came, everything here would have to be taken care of by him… No, by himself and Second Brother?</p><p>In an instant, the Storyteller’s scalp went numb.</p><p>“Sigh.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed faintly. “After all these years, not only have you not grown at all, you’ve even regressed so much.”</p><p>“Old Seven, you have to know that arrogance and disregard for others will eventually bring disaster to you!”</p><p>“Do you understand?”</p><p>“I…” The Storyteller’s tone was a little ashamed as he was scolded until he could not speak.</p><p>“Acknowledged, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>“In Awe, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>At this moment, the many Red Coats who were fighting the ghost beast seemed to have received some orders at the same time as they all flew away.</p><p>At the same time, Lan Ling shouted.</p><p>“Gather, in formation!”</p><p>“Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…”</p><p>Many figures of Red Coats, including Heiming, Xin, and the Night Guardian who had disappeared into the spatial fragment, appeared in the sky.</p><p>They stood in line, secretly following the path of the Heaven-Sealing Great Array.</p><p>“Break the realm!”</p><p>As soon as Lan Ling said these three words, the Storyteller immediately admired second brother.</p><p>Sure enough, there was a reason why he was able to take second place.</p><p>Red Coat clearly did not perform at all, but he had already secretly notified everyone and immediately changed the policy, trying to break open the ancient book space.</p><p>He did not realize that Second Brother knew it like the back of his hand.</p><p>However, would the plan stop here?</p><p>Was everything really that simple?</p><p>The Storyteller, who was hiding in the spatial fragment, smiled faintly.</p><p>“So what if I’ve discovered it?”</p><p>“In front of absolute strength, brains are just decorations!”</p><p>He watched as the spiritual source of the Red Coats exploded one by one, and they were about to join forces to destroy the ancient book space.</p><p>The Storyteller waved his hand.</p><p>“Freeze!”</p><p>With a buzz, the blood-soaked minotaur’s momentum was halted, and the Holy War Black Angel’s wings could no longer flap.</p><p>Within the Red Coats, including the Night Guardian and the others, all of them felt that the spiritual source in their bodies had solidified. It was as if a tremendous force had been exerted on them. It was so obscure that it was difficult for them to move it.</p><p>The entire space of the Lijian Grassland was frozen.</p><p>Before the shock in everyone’s eyes could be revealed, a delicate voice had already fallen from the sky.</p><p>“Not bad, not bad. It’s faster than I expected.”</p><p>“I didn’t expect to be discovered so easily by you guys. It’s really annoying.”</p><p>A red dress fluttered down in front of everyone’s shocked eyes.</p><p>The Storyteller appeared beside Lan Ling. He held her slender waist with one hand and blew gently into her ear.</p><p>“Ha!”</p><p>“It’s you, right? I shouldn’t have guessed wrongly… brains are so useful!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
