He seemed to have seen the real possibility of an ant shaking a tree.</p><p>This was a bloody monster!</p><p>“A sovereign at the Dao realm can comprehend to the perfection of the Upanishad, but not after Cutting Path?” Zhao Xidong calmed down and asked.</p><p>Xiao Qixiu nodded in response.</p><p>“Then what’s the point of cutting path so quickly?” Zhao Xidong was stunned. “When one is in the Dao realm of the throne, only when one has comprehended to the perfection of the final-stage can one Cut Path. Isn’t that the most perfect ending…”</p><p>He suddenly couldn’t continue.</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>If it was so simple, why would Boss Xiao emphasize that there was only one place in the world that was cultivating talents in this area?</p><p>“Spirit Division, huh…”</p><p>Zhao Xidong mumbled absent-mindedly.</p><p>Xiao Qixiu knew that this kid had finally figured something out. He smiled and said, “Upanishad is not so easy to control.”</p><p>“The Dao that you have comprehended in the sovereign realm is the foundation for you to continue to advance in the future.”</p><p>“This foundation stone is indeed more perfect, which means that your future is more and more limitless. You can even break through the Cutting Path, enter the Higher Void, and become a demi-saint very quickly.”</p><p>“But similarly, the more perfect the foundation stone is, the more indestructible it becomes.”</p><p>“Everyone can try to comprehend it. It’s just a matter of whether or not they are willing to spend this time.”</p><p>“But too many people try to break through to the perfect realm. In the end, they can’t comprehend the Upanishad. However, because their comprehension is too deep, it exceeds the limits of their talent. In the end, they can’t break through their foundational roots.”</p><p>“If that’s the case, then you will forever remain at the sovereign’s throne realm, and you will not be able to become a sovereign of the Cutting Path.”</p><p>So that was the case!</p><p>Zhao Xidong finally understood what it meant to truly be at the sovereign’s Throne Dao realm, as well as the Cutting Path.</p><p>He did have such a vague concept in the past, but this explanation was very clear, and it allowed him to completely comprehend it.</p><p>“Then…”</p><p>After hesitating for a while, Zhao Xidong finally turned his head to look at the sovereign.</p><p>A few years ago, when he was still a disciple of the inner yard, the sovereign was still the sovereign.</p><p>A few years later, when he had already graduated and even returned from his adventures outside, the sovereign was still the sovereign.</p><p>But the sovereign at that time was completely different from the sovereign today!</p><p>Every time they met again after not seeing each other for a long time, Zhao Xidong could feel that the sovereign’s strength had improved greatly, but he always thought it was an illusion.</p><p>After all, they were both sovereign seats.</p><p>“It’s not an illusion.”</p><p>Xiao Qixiu laughed and voiced his thoughts. “Your Headmaster Ye is walking on the path of ‘profundity’… Space attributes, it can be said that the difficulty of his future Path-Cutting will only be higher than Yu Lingdi’s! Much higher!”</p><p>“Hiss.”</p><p>Zhao Xidong sucked in a breath of cold air. He finally understood why Gou Wuyue had offered an olive branch to the dean earlier.</p><p>However, at the same time, Zhao Xidong was even more in awe of Ye Xiaotian who had the confidence to reject him on the spot.</p><p>Taking the risk of not being able to sever his foundational roots, he had flatly rejected the help of the Holy Divine Palace..</p><p>As expected of the headmaster!</p><p>“Upanishad, is it really that difficult?” Zhao Xidong pondered for a long time before asking again.</p><p>“It’s very difficult.”</p><p>“How difficult is it?”</p><p>“Look.”</p><p>Xiao Qixiu pointed at the rain that filled the sky and said, “In the entire spirit division of the Holy Divine Palace, there’s only one person who has comprehended Upanishad. How difficult do you think it is?”</p><p>“UH.”</p><p>This time, Zhao Xidong choked.</p><p>Even such a huge organization like the Holy Divine Palace could not mass-produce, and there was only one..</p><p>“Then in this world, other than the Holy Divine Palace, wouldn’t no one else be able to comprehend the Upanishad?” Zhao Xidong was shocked.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian suddenly spoke from the side.</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi and Xiao Qixiu also laughed out loud.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>Zhao Xidong looked at these three people who were baffled and was somewhat puzzled.</p><p>“Keng.”</p><p>Xiao Qixiu pulled out his sword. “What’s this?”</p><p>“Vital organ?” Zhao Xidong hesitated for a moment before saying.</p><p>“Dong!”</p><p>“Aiyo, what the hell!”</p><p>“This is a sword!” Xiao Qixiu said unhappily.</p><p>“Oh, OH, a sword. What’s wrong?” Zhao Xidong held his head and was in so much pain that tears were coming out.</p><p>Xiao Qixiu took a deep breath and said in a serious voice,</p><p>“Ancient sword technique is also known as the most difficult great path in the world. It contains everything. There are nine major sword techniques, eighteen flows, 3000 sword styles… and so on</p><p>“There are even people who call it the most difficult and unrivaled great path in the world!”</p><p>“And then?” Zhao Xidong’s eyes widened.</p><p>“But in this world, there is still someone who has comprehended the Way of the Sword!”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“You know.” Xiao Qixiu laughed and didn’t reply directly.</p><p>I know… Zhao Xidong frowned. His thoughts were mixed, and he couldn’t remember who it was at all.</p><p>All of a sudden, an image of a legendary man that he had never seen before flashed through his mind. But at the same time, he was described as mysterious by all kinds of rumors in the world. At the same time, he also had a full body.</p><p>He cried out in surprise, “No…”</p><p>“It’s coming!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian suddenly spoke out and interrupted the conversation between the two.</p><p>The black hole in the Nine Heavens grew bigger and bigger until it completely collapsed. After a loud crash, countless surging and majestic destructive forces raged out from within.</p><p>“Boom, Boom, boom…”</p><p>The grayish-black airflow was like a mountain flood breaking through a dam, and a tsunami bursting through the dike.</p><p>It was difficult for everyone present to imagine what had happened in the white cave to cause this magnificent scene to appear.</p><p>But now…</p><p>White-clothed had long been prepared. Once the grayish-black air current that poured out from the White Cave world appeared, it was completely absorbed by a white-robed person holding a spiritual gourd.</p><p>“Rustle, Rustle…”</p><p>The energy that exploded from the black hole was completely swallowed.</p><p>Zhao Xidong’s throat was dry as he watched. “Did the White Cave explode? Such terrifying energy… who did it?”</p><p>“It might not have exploded.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi said from the side, “If it exploded, I reckon that even the spiritual array here wouldn’t be able to withstand it. The worst possibility, but at the same time, it’s also the best possibility…”</p><p>“Even if there’s still a red-robed inside, or if there’s the protection of Yu Lingdi, it’ll be able to protect the White Cave world that’s about to explode and reduce the damage to a certain extent. At least half of it!”</p><p>“As for who did it…”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi suddenly felt a chill.</p><p>A cheeky thing appeared in his mind. The key thing was that this thing had a human face!</p><p>“No, no, no, it can’t be that, he’s just a mere innate…” Qiao Qianzhi thought to himself and shuddered.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian, who was in front, suddenly trembled.</p><p>Even Xiao Qixiu’s mouth twitched slightly.</p><p>Zhao Xidong was stunned.</p><p>A figure appeared in his mind, but he immediately denied it.</p><p>“By the way, Xu Xiaoshou should have come out a long time ago. At this moment, he’s also imprisoned there?” He thought, and his eyes couldn’t help but glance at the space that Ye Xiaotian didn’t take down.</p><p>“Ye Xiaotian, it’s time to go.”</p><p>Xiao Qixiu looked at the movement of this world and could not help but advise, “If we wait any longer, we will probably have a hard time getting out even if the Saint Servant’s people come out.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian shook his head slowly. “Even if there is still one person missing, as long as he is still a disciple of the Tiansang Spirit Palace, I have the responsibility and obligation to bring him home.”</p><p>After a pause, he added, “Moreover, there is more than one person missing.”</p><p>“Maybe he is dead,” Xiao Qixiu said expressionlessly.</p><p>“Darn jinx!”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi turned around and cursed, “That kid is very lucky. I watched him grow up. How could he die so easily?”</p><p>Zhao Xidong was confused and was about to ask something.</p><p>Suddenly, a streak of color appeared in the darkness above the nine heavens.</p><p>Everyone immediately looked over vigilantly.</p><p>“Whoosh Whoosh Whoosh…”</p><p>A few figures descended from the sky. They were all dressed in ragged clothes and looked like refugees. Even their bodies and faces were stained with blood. There was not a single piece of flesh left.</p><p>“Elder Wuyue.”</p><p>The moment these people landed, they bowed to Gou Wuyue.</p><p>The vigilant white-clothed people finally heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>Fortunately, fortunately, they were on the same side..</p><p>Gou Wuyue’s eyes swept over the people who had come.</p><p>He still remembered the last scene from the intelligence report. There were still more than a dozen people in red-robed.</p><p>But at this moment, only six people had actually come outside.</p><p>The casualties were heavy!</p><p>Looking at one of the figures who seemed to have his belly cut open, Gou Wuyue finally recognized a few strands of a familiar smell from his unsightly face.</p><p>“Night… Guardian?” He asked in bewilderment.</p><p>“Yes! I’ve embarrassed Elder Wuyue.” Night Guardian’s figure turned solemn, but his expression was extremely unsightly.</p><p>In the end, he still wasn’t able to rely on himself to swallow that wave of energy.</p><p>Just a small leak had caused the already badly damaged White Cave world to shake.</p><p>Under the chain reaction, even if Lan Ling was controlling the formation at the Li Sword Plains, she wouldn’t be able to withstand it.</p><p>The White Cave had really exploded!</p><p>However, it had only exploded halfway. The rain in the sky had repaired most of the space, leaving behind the seed of a dimensional space.</p><p>When the time came, the White Cave might have a chance to make a name for itself again.</p><p>In this way, one of the Seven Breaks, the Infernal Hell Sea, wouldn’t disappear, and then be transferred and reborn.</p><p>— A blessing in disguise!</p><p>“You’ve done well.”</p><p>Gou Wuyue had a smile on his face. He reached out and patted the Night Guardian’s shoulder, then looked at the others. “Everyone, go and rest. Leave the rest to me.”</p><p>“Hum –”</p><p>The famed sword trembled.</p><p>That warm voice that seemed to be able to calm people’s hearts caused Baldy Xin’s eyes to fill with tears.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The red-robed men shouted in unison and disappeared in a flash.</p><p>“Night Guardian.”</p><p>Gou Wuyue finally called out to the Night Guardian.</p><p>“What orders does Elder Wuyue have?”</p><p>The Night Guardian was actually a little excited.</p><p>When he saw Gou Wuyue again, he seemed to recall the days when he fought everywhere.</p><p>Although there were only a few familiar faces left in this group of white-clothed brothers, the hot-blooded feeling of encircling the saint servant that would make people boil with excitement after a long time was a completely different feeling from the battle with the Ghost Beast.</p><p>If possible, he wished that he could stay and fight alongside Elder Wuyue!</p><p>Gou Wuyue stretched out his hand and put it on the shoulder of the Night Guardian.</p><p>The bloody wound on the latter’s stomach began to heal at an accelerated pace.</p><p>It was only after the other party had barely recovered a few wisps of essence, Qi, and spirit that Gou Wuyue said, “I already know everything in the White Cave.”</p><p>“Rain?” The Night Guardian asked.</p><p>It was only in the end that he realized that something was wrong with the rain.</p><p>“Yes, Yu Lingdi’s ability.”</p><p>Gou Wuyue glanced at the black hole in the void. It was obvious that he did not want to linger on this question. He directly went straight to the point, “That Wen Ming, do you know who he is?”</p><p>“Wen Ming?”</p><p>The Night Guardian was startled.</p><p>He did not expect that Elder Wuyue would ask this question first.</p><p>However, when he thought about the situation in the White Cave, Elder Wuyue already knew about it, so..</p><p>Wen Ming, Xu Xiaoshou, ice sculpture, Lu Ke, famed sword, master and disciple..</p><p>Night Guardian immediately understood.</p><p>He said dejectedly, “Wen Ming is Xu Xiaoshou, the disciple of the second-in-command of the Saint Servant. Of course, this deduction is still open to discussion, but it is probably not far from the truth…”</p><p>“I discovered it too late.”</p><p>The Night Guardian changed the topic and said with some self-blame, “If I could have seen the uniqueness of this kid earlier and brought him back to the red-robed directly, maybe Xiao Ke wouldn’t have…”</p><p>“I’m not asking about that.”</p><p>Gou Wuyue shook his head and said, “Lu Ke is his own choice.”</p><p>“Since I dared to put him in the red-robed team, I was prepared for him to die at any time.”</p><p>“Without experiencing life and death, how can he really grow?”</p><p>“What I want to ask…”</p><p>Gou Wuyue pondered for a moment, “Wen Ming, the Xu Xiaoshou that you mentioned, who is he?”</p><p>Who?</p><p>Night Guardian was momentarily at a loss for words and didn’t know how to reply.</p><p>Gou Wuyue counted his fingers.</p><p>“Master physique, Giant Transformation, master sword intent, famed sword, Fourth sword, Infernal Power, Three Days Frozen Calamity… but I think his cultivation level isn’t high?”</p><p>Night Guardian was stunned for a moment.</p><p>Only when Xu Xiaoshou’s abilities were truly counted did he truly realize what Elder Wuyue wanted to ask.</p><p>Swallowing a mouthful of saliva with difficulty, Night Guardian said, “Yes, innate cultivation level at most.”</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>“I’m sure!”</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>“Absolutely!”</p><p>Night Guardian had already realized the seriousness of the matter.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had caught Elder Wuyue’s eye!</p><p>His expression was solemn, his tone was extremely serious, “You haven’t seen everything yet. From what I’ve seen, not only does he possess the abilities you mentioned above, he’s also a spirit array caster, conducting alchemy… exploding… conducting alchemy… un… how should I put it…”</p><p>“Un?” Gou Wuyue tilted his head and asked.</p><p>“Magic Pill Technician!”</p><p>“They’re all of very high rank, and they’re also very surprising!” Night Guardian wiped his sweat and said seriously, “This kind of person is definitely a talent!”</p><p>Gou Wuyue silently lowered his head.</p><p>After pondering for a long time, he finally raised his head and said with a smile, “But he has joined the Saint Servant.”</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The black hole in the nine heavens exploded, as if something was going to spew out again.</p><p>Night Guardian’s mind also exploded.</p><p>He subconsciously wanted to say “Impossible”.</p><p>However, Elder Wuyue didn’t seem to be the type of person who would joke around..</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Night Guardian still said this sentence.</p><p>Then, regardless of how Elder Wuyue’s expression was, he continued to speak:</p><p>“He, Xu Xiaoshou, is a little cowardly and a little cowardly, but this kind of person is naturally proud and unyielding. It’s impossible for him to choose to submit to others, absolutely impossible!”</p><p>“Oh right, I forgot to tell you…”</p><p>Night Guardian suddenly closed his eyes and suddenly opened them again.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou’s greatest ability is not his powerful skills, but his ability to run his mouth like a train.”</p><p>“This guy…”</p><p>“I don’t know what image you saw from Yu Lingdi, but if he’s more sincere and sincere, the credibility will be lower!”</p><p>“If nine out of ten sentences are true, then that’s enough.”</p><p>“It’s best not to listen to the rest.”</p><p>Night Guardian’s words came one after another.</p><p>“…” Gou Wuyue was stunned.</p><p>“Senior.”</p><p>Night Guardian clenched his fists. “Xu Xiaoshou is not a saint servant!”</p><p>“Are you saying this because you want to train him as a successor?” Gou Wuyue raised the corner of his mouth and raised his eyebrows.</p><p>The Night Guardian panicked and said, “There might be a reason for this, but it’s definitely not the case.”</p><p>“You know, I won’t misjudge him because of this little thought…”</p><p>“What is that?” Gou Wuyue asked back. This was his former subordinate, and he knew the Night Guardian’s temperament the best.</p><p>And the first-hand information could only be the most accurate if it came from the judgment of the person closest to him.</p><p>Night Guardian was silent for a moment before he said, “Other than that mouth of his, that strange spiritual technique of his, his ambition and arrogance are almost the same as when I first entered the white-clothed state! It’s absolutely true!”</p><p>The scene fell silent for a moment.</p><p>Gou Wuyue could not help but laugh out loud.</p><p>“I understand. Go ahead and stand by at any time.”</p><p>“Yes…”</p><p>Night Guardian subconsciously responded, suddenly realizing what he meant by “stand by at any time.”.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>With a loud shout, he turned around and disappeared.</p><p>..</p><p>“Rumble –”</p><p>There was another explosion in the void.</p><p>Half of the pitter-patter of rain was absorbed into the black hole, and the other half fell to the ground.</p><p>“Hehe.”</p><p>A low laugh suddenly came out of the black hole, and then turned into a silver bell-like laughter.</p><p>“Hehehe, there are so many people, Brother, I’m so scared.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
