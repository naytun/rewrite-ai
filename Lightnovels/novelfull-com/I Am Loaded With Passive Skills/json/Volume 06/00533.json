If they did not personally feel the Divine Array’s might, Xu Xiaoshou would not be able to make a move.</p><p>“Weng!”</p><p>The moment his palm touched the Divine Array’s spatial barrier, the dao mechanisms in the void surged.</p><p>In the next second.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>An intense explosion sounded.</p><p>As the airflow surged, a worried expression appeared on Mu Zixi’s small face.</p><p>“Xiu.”</p><p>After a soft sound, the shadow that was reflected was actually the body of the ‘Path Pattern Initial Stone’.</p><p>Mu Zixi:”…”</p><p>As expected, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t need anyone to worry about him.</p><p>Everything that he came into contact with, outsiders should be worried about him!</p><p>“He’s quite strong…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered and flipped his palm.</p><p>The large bloody wound in his palm had already healed during the process of raising his hand.</p><p>The ruptured tendons and bones within his body had also recovered to their peak condition under the ‘Eternal Vitality’.</p><p>“To be able to injure a grandmaster with just a touch, it’s obvious that the idea of breaking the formation with brute force isn’t realistic.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered.</p><p>With just this touch, he was able to understand the strength and form of the Divine Array’s attack.</p><p>“Rebound… or rather, it’s similar to a ‘rebound’.”</p><p>However, it was obvious that the rebound from the touch was unable to withstand his own ‘toughness’.</p><p>Therefore, the one that was ejected was the body of the ‘Path Pattern Initial Stone’.</p><p>However!</p><p>“If I break it with brute force, it will probably only cause more damage.”</p><p>“There’s no need to consider whether I can block it or not, as long as it’s…”</p><p>“What if the berserk giant’s punch breaks the Divine Array, and the ‘Path Pattern Initial Stone’ is destroyed as well? Then what should I do?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his chin, feeling conflicted.</p><p>So difficult..</p><p>Others might be conflicted about whether or not their attacks were strong enough.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was mainly worried about how strong the defense of the ‘Path Pattern Initial Stone’ was after it lost the Divine Array’s protection.</p><p>If it was like an ordinary stone, then even if he broke the Divine Array, it would be useless.</p><p>If it couldn’t withstand the damage, then wouldn’t all his efforts be wasted?</p><p>“Use the ‘Weaving Expertise’ to undo it!”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou thought about it, his spiritual sense enveloped the Divine Array.</p><p>However, before he had the time to observe the entire situation, his spiritual sense, which had been tempered, turned into ashes when it came into contact with it.</p><p>“UH.”</p><p>“Can spiritual sense be isolated?”</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou felt a headache coming on.</p><p>Without Yu Zhiwen’s existence, he, a half-baked Divine Sorcerer, actually had no idea what to do with this Divine Array.</p><p>“Damn it…”</p><p>Without using spiritual sense, Xu Xiaoshou began to perceive the existence of the Divine Array with his naked eyes.</p><p>With Yu Zhiwen’s previous enlightenment, he quickly saw the complicated divine path pattern.</p><p>However, he was completely confused!</p><p>The layers of the Divine Array were like a few large balls of hemp that had accidentally fallen to the ground.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t even tell how many layers of the spirit array were embedded in it, so how could he unravel it?</p><p>“This isn’t the Divine Array that Weaving Expertise can unravel at the moment.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was disappointed.</p><p>Weaving Expertise was only grandmaster LV. 1.</p><p>According to his expectations, in order to come into contact with the Divine Array, he had to raise his cultivation by a few levels.</p><p>However, due to the limitations of his cultivation, being able to reach Grandmaster level was already his current limit.</p><p>It was impossible for him to go any higher!</p><p>“What should I do…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated in midair.</p><p>With a swoosh, Mu Zixi flew to his senior brother’s side.</p><p>“How is it? Can you undo it?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Then what about smashing it open?” He said Xu Xiaoshou’s usual style.</p><p>“I don’t dare.”</p><p>“Then what else can we do?” Mu Zixi was conflicted.</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>Mu Zixi:”…”</p><p>She casually pointed at the “Cardinal Wheel” and said, “Can you undo it with this thing?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned his head to look. His eyes lit up, but they quickly dimmed.</p><p>“Theoretically, it’s possible, but I shouldn’t be able to do it at the moment.”</p><p>“Is that so…”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s brain spun rapidly, and she said again, “Isn’t this your Abrogated Origin Residence? Shouldn’t it be able to be solved with just a glance?”</p><p>“Theoretically, it’s the same.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a headache coming on and said, “But I’ve tried it. It’s useless. It should be the power of the rules in the little world of White Cave. It’s far greater than the current incomplete level of the rules in Abrogated Origin Residence, so it’s useless.”</p><p>“OH.”</p><p>Mu Zixi nodded as if she had understood something.</p><p>She looked around and her gaze suddenly fell on Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“What, what?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. “I don’t know anything. I’m a good-for-nothing.”</p><p>“I’m not looking at you.”</p><p>Mu Zixi waved her hand and pointed at the primal chaos fog behind him. Her big eyes flashed.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, grind It!”</p><p>“Isn’t this Chaotic Mist very powerful? Use It to melt the Divine Array. When the array is damaged, you can take out the ‘Path Pattern Initial Stone’. Isn’t that enough?”</p><p>“Oh?” Xu Xiaoshou was enlightened. He held his junior’s face and said in surprise, “When did you become so smart?”</p><p>“Hehe.”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s face was deformed from being pinched. She couldn’t even speak clearly, but she put her hands on her hips with a haughty manner. “I was originally a fool…”</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou received a punch and sent the ‘Path Pattern Initial Stone’ into the Chaotic Mist.</p><p>“Zi Zi Zi –”</p><p>The next second, the Divine Array and the Chaotic Mist seemed to have an intense chemical reaction, and a sizzling sound could be heard.</p><p>“Bang Bang Bang…”</p><p>The sound of explosions exploded from the Chaotic Mist time and time again.</p><p>The air current suddenly swelled up and rolled up heavily.</p><p>Bang Bang Bang.</p><p>Xu Xiaoji’s heart was flustered as he watched.</p><p>This Big Devil King was here again!</p><p>The Abrogated Origin Residence was supposed to be peaceful every time, but as soon as Xu Xiaoshou appeared, it would definitely cause some destruction.</p><p>If he didn’t stay a little further this time, he really didn’t know how he would be blown up again.</p><p>Quietly, it turned into an inconspicuous stone and moved step by step in the opposite direction of the ‘Path Pattern Initial Stone’.</p><p>“Zi Zi Zi –”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou closely watched the movements of the Divine Array.</p><p>It was very obvious that no matter how powerful an existence was, after entering the Chaotic Mist, the corrosion that should occur was unavoidable.</p><p>However, thinking about it, it made sense. On one side, it was a terrifying existence that would only be born when heaven and earth were born.</p><p>On the other side, it was merely the Divine Array formed to protect the spiritual treasure.</p><p>It was easy to tell who was stronger.</p><p>However, the Divine Array’s defensive strength was quite high after all. Based on the current rate of progress,.</p><p>Even if the corrosion was completed in the end, it would be impossible without ten days or half a month.</p><p>Every second in the white cave was precious.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou would not waste her time guarding the ‘Path Pattern Initial Stone’.</p><p>“Condense!”</p><p>With a thought, the power of law in the small space of Abrogated Origin Residence was mobilized. In an instant, the Chaotic Mist began to circulate and gather in the direction of the ‘Path Pattern Initial Stone’.</p><p>“Bang Bang Bang!”</p><p>The sound of the explosion became even more intense.</p><p>It was obvious that as the density of the Chaotic Mist began to increase, the Divine Array’s dissolution rate also increased linearly.</p><p>Just by observing, Xu Xiaoshou could see that the foundational roots on it was beginning to become unstable and the divine path patterns were dissolving.</p><p>“Be careful.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know what consequences this method would cause, but he still whispered to his junior beside him.</p><p>However, when he turned around, Mu Zixi was gone.</p><p>“En, where did she go?”</p><p>He turned around and saw his junior run to the opposite side of the “Path Pattern Initial Stone”. There was even a wood element enchantment set up there.</p><p>The thick and solid layers of tree stumps wrapped around her. It was obvious that they were specially prepared for the big explosion.</p><p>Outside, a small stone that could move was launching repeated attacks, trying to squeeze into the wood pillar enchantment to take refuge.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: “…”</p><p>He moved slightly to the back.</p><p>After thinking for a moment, he took out a Spirit Defense Shield from the throne of the Zhang family and erected it.</p><p>“Ice and Ember, come in front of me.”</p><p>“Right, that’s it. Just block with your feet. There’s no need to move. There’s no space in the Abrogated Origin Residence for you to move around.”</p><p>“Very good, keep it that way.”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou spoke, he took out another black stone and threw it on the ground.</p><p>“Mama…”</p><p>The moment Aje appeared, he curiously cast his gaze in the direction of the ‘Path Pattern Initial Stone’.</p><p>..</p><p>“Boom Boom Boom!”</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, the explosion seemed to have leveled up.</p><p>The Chaotic Mist scattered in all directions, dissolving deep pits in the ground of the Abrogated Origin Residence.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sat upright in Ember’s eye sockets while Aje was in front of him.</p><p>He was constantly paying attention to the movements of the ‘Path Pattern Initial Stone’.</p><p>“It’s about time.”</p><p>The Chaotic Mist was too strong.</p><p>The Divine Array, which no one could touch, had already been corroded beyond recognition during this period of time. Xu Xiaoshou could see the remaining nesting structure at a glance.</p><p>“There’s basically no nesting structure left.”</p><p>“According to this progress, the Divine Array will completely collapse in less than the time it takes for an incense stick to burn.”</p><p>“At that time, will the Chaotic Mist hurt the ‘Path Pattern Initial Stone’…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was being suspected.</p><p>At this moment, the Divine Array, which could not hold on at all, seemed to be fighting back at the last moment as it expanded simultaneously.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was immediately gripped in his heart.</p><p>As expected.</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>In the next second, a loud explosion reverberated in all directions, directly blasting a black hole in the primal chaos fog.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was about to shrink his head.</p><p>However, he saw the terrifying suction force in the space fragment. In the blink of an eye, it was about to pull the ‘Path Pattern Initial Stone’ that had already appeared into it.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>“Mummy…”</p><p>Before he had the time to rush out, a shadow flashed in front of him. Aje had already turned around.</p><p>He spread out his small palm. A small white skeleton that was glowing appeared in his palm.</p><p>“Path Pattern Initial Stone?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was pleasantly surprised.</p><p>Aje, when did he become so humane?</p><p>He didn’t even have the time to give it an order, but it had already learned to analyze and judge, and brought the ‘Path Pattern Initial Stone’ over?</p><p>“Smart!”</p><p>Stroking Aje’s smooth head, Xu Xiaoshou took the ‘Path Pattern Initial Stone’ over.</p><p>As he took it, the ‘Path Pattern Initial Stone’ that was originally a white skeleton with spirit patterns wrapped around it actually began to change.</p><p>As it slowly squirmed, it transformed into Xu Xiaoshou’s appearance.</p><p>It was naked and lifelike!</p><p>In the next second, Xu Xiaoshou slowly rose into the air.</p><p>“Weng!”</p><p>When it reached a certain height, it was on par with the life spirit seal. After a crisp sound, it seemed to have completely embedded itself into this space.</p><p>“Ka Ka.”</p><p>A new Divine Array began to form on its own.</p><p>Layers of nested spirit arrays began to be born, locking it tightly and finally fixing it in the sky.</p><p>Xiu</p><p>When the Divine Array was completely formed, a stream of light shot out from the ‘Path Pattern Initial Stone’, turning into colorful stars that scattered among the surrounding Chaotic Mist.</p><p>Rumble Rumble..</p><p>The stars touched the fog, and the fog melted.</p><p>Then, rumbling sounds came, and the earth began to extend outwards.</p><p>The speed was extremely fast, and in the blink of an eye, it expanded by several times.</p><p>Not only that, all kinds of surface shapes began to appear.</p><p>At the beginning, it was just flat ground.</p><p>Later on, small hills, mud and stone ground appeared one after another.</p><p>Then, small hills, small basins, small mud..</p><p>“Junior!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately shouted.</p><p>How could he not let his junior see the world in such a spectacular world?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, this is…”</p><p>Mu Zixi popped her head out of the wooden pillar enchantment and was immediately shocked.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, the Abrogated Origin Residence had completely changed.</p><p>Not only did the space expand to more than ten miles, but the various surface forms were simply a miniature version of the real world!</p><p>“The Divine Array has been cracked?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around and glanced at her.</p><p>If it hadn’t been cracked, how could there have been such a change?</p><p>The two of them didn’t say anything more.</p><p>At this moment, the speed of the Earth’s expansion began to slow down.</p><p>But a new change appeared.</p><p>The “Path Pattern Initial Stone” once again spewed out a ray of multicolored light.</p><p>This ray of multicolored light didn’t shoot up into the sky. Instead, it took on the shape of a circular ripple and spread out from the center of the circle.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, it affected the entire Abrogated Origin Residence.</p><p>“Elements?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s “Perception” had sharply caught the large number of ice and fire element light spots that had appeared in the air.</p><p>Not only that, he could also sense that the number of elements in those different systems had also doubled in an instant.</p><p>He turned his head.</p><p>As expected.</p><p>The junior who was bathed in the aura of life and the dense wood element had already raised her two ponytails with a satisfied look on her face.</p><p>“The spiritual energy has appeared!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was overjoyed.</p><p>The Abrogated Origin Residence also had spiritual energy, but it was almost impossible to use it for cultivation.</p><p>Because that little bit of spiritual energy was drawn from the outside world by the Abrogated Origin Residence.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was cultivating here..</p><p>Rather than saying that it was cultivation, it was more appropriate to say that it was absorbing the life spiritual energy of the ‘Spirit Mark of Life’.</p><p>Because at that time, the Abrogated Origin Residence only had the attribute of life.</p><p>But now, after the rules of the Great Path were perfected, there was the first ray of multicolored light emitted by the ‘Path Pattern Initial Stone’.</p><p>The Abrogated Origin Residence world could finally be self-sufficient.</p><p>“The embryonic form of the world has appeared.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the Abrogated Origin Residence that had once again quieted down and was filled with excitement.</p><p>Even though the land that had just appeared was still extremely desolate.</p><p>But with the land, he could cultivate and even have the most important life attribute.</p><p>Wasn’t the rest slowly cultivated?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, so big…”</p><p>Mu Zixi flew over, her mouth already shocked into an “O” shape.</p><p>The space in the Abrogated Origin Residence at this moment was more than twice as big as the Spirit Fusion Swamp from before.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had said that it was more than twice as big.</p><p>It was even more than a hundred times!</p><p>And the originally worried problem of Ice and Ember’s movements wasn’t a problem at all at this moment.</p><p>Even the two big guys were wrestling, rolling, jumping..</p><p>Everything was fine!</p><p>“Yeah, it’s a little big, but it still feels like something is missing…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the landscape in front of her and felt that it wasn’t perfect.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s big eyes rolled as she had an idea.</p><p>She clapped her hands.</p><p>“Little Tree, rise!”</p><p>Crackle, crackle.</p><p>The saplings that had risen from the ground grew crazily under the nourishment of the spiritual essence of life and Mu Zixi’s control.</p><p>In an instant, a large patch of green appeared in front of her.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, isn’t this fine?”</p><p>Mu Zixi clapped her hands and turned her head to look at Xu Xiaoshou as if she was taking credit.</p><p>“…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the patch of green in front of him and didn’t know what to say for a moment.</p><p>So, the thing that Abrogated Origin Residence lacked… was green?</p><p>“Isn’t it enough?”</p><p>Mu Zixi looked at Xu Xiaoshou who was in a daze and didn’t say anything. Her small face wrinkled.</p><p>“If it’s not enough, then give me some more!”</p><p>She looked in the other direction and hit the ground furiously.</p><p>In an instant, weeds grew crazily on the barren land.</p><p>This time, it wasn’t the forest but the grassland. The amount of energy spent was many times smaller.</p><p>In less than a few breaths, Mu Zixi had almost turned half of her Abrogated Origin Residence green.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was flustered by the green in front of her. She immediately hugged the girl from the ground.</p><p>“Enough, enough. It’s already green enough. There’s no need to continue…”</p><p>“Not enough, not enough!”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s eyes lit up with excitement when she saw the green.</p><p>How could she not plant this piece of her own land in front of her?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, just you wait. I’ll plant another piece of green for you…”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou angrily covered the girl’s mouth.</p><p>Immediately, the girl punched and kicked.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, shake me…”</p><p>How could Xu Xiaoshou let her have her way?</p><p>With a wave of his hand, he drew a piece of land close to the “Life spirit seal” in the space of his Abrogated Origin Residence and planted the spiritual medicine left behind by the big explosion.</p><p>“What should I do next?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that his Abrogated Origin Residence had been reborn. He had a lot of things to do, and he would have to spend a lot of time not being able to go to the White Cave. He could only transform here.</p><p>He had to admit that this idea was actually very good. He could also avoid all the risks in the White Cave.</p><p>However, looking at the emptiness in front of him, he did not know where to start.</p><p>“Pitter-patter…”</p><p>Suddenly, water elements gathered in the sky and drizzle began to fall.</p><p>Feeling the coldness on the top of his head and the back of his hand, Xu Xiaoshou looked up in surprise.</p><p>The sky of Abrogated Origin Residence was no longer empty.</p><p>The dark clouds in the blue sky were so vivid at this moment.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, it’s raining…”</p><p>Mu Zixi also stopped struggling and turned her head to look at the first rain in Abrogated Origin Residence with difficulty.</p><p>“Yes, it’s raining.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou murmured softly.</p><p>He didn’t have a good impression of the rain on the sacred divine continent.</p><p>He still remembered that when he was in the Tiansang Spirit Palace, he was attacked by Feng Kong and Shao Yi in the first rain and almost lost his life.</p><p>Later on, every rainy night, he didn’t seem to have a good experience either.</p><p>However, the first rain in Abrogated Origin Residence completely extinguished the anxiety in his heart.</p><p>Sage layout, the birth of Fourth Sword, Abrogated Origin Residence space transformation..</p><p>What’s the hurry!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt relieved.</p><p>It’s gonna happen.</p><p>Instead of hiding, thinking of using something else to fool yourself, and then accomplishing the shameful purpose of self-deception.</p><p>Rather, directly choose to face!</p><p>“Hoo!”</p><p>The sound of the wind blowing, blowing two people are not wet clothes ripples.</p><p>Mu Zixi was stunned for a moment and said in surprise, “Xu Xiaoshou, the wind! It’s the wind!”</p><p>“There’s wind in the Abrogated Origin Residence now. It’s finally no longer the shockwave from the explosion. Oh Yeah!”</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou heard this joyous sound, it was as if his state of mind had started to fluctuate along with the ripples of the raindrops.</p><p>“Perception”, Xu Xiaoshou had already stealthily transformed into his physical form and reached out his hand to hold it.</p><p>At the intersection of his palms, a similar ticking sound could be heard.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The ember skeleton tore at the rainwater on its body in frustration.</p><p>It hated this cold feeling.</p><p>“Mummy…”</p><p>Aje slowly walked out and walked past Ember, walking towards the direction of Xu Xiaoji.</p><p>“Hohoho, Hohoho ~”</p><p>Ember’s chaotic cloak fist technique combined with his dance steps, turning into a campfire rain dance.</p><p>“Ha…”</p><p>Ice raised her head and called out softly.</p><p>The raindrops fell within a hundred feet of its body and directly turned into ice grits.</p><p>The surface of the ground was flowing with luster, and there were crisp sounds of falling from the layer of ice.</p><p>“Junior.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grabbed Mu Zixi’s wet twin ponytails and flipped her over from her hands.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Junior turned her head away and pulled the twin ponytails back with a frown.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, can you put me down first?”</p><p>“Cursed, passive value, + 1.”</p><p>“Do you want to go out for a walk?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou put Mu Zixi down and looked into the distance.</p><p>“Where to?”</p><p>Mu Zixi keenly sensed that her senior brother was not in the right mood.</p><p>A strange feeling..</p><p>She did not mess around anymore.</p><p>Instead, she looked at the fertile green grassland behind her and said, “Why don’t I take it back?”</p><p>“PFFT.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused. “No need. Green is good. Abrogated Origin Residence just lacks this.”</p><p>Hearing this, the little girl’s smile bloomed again. Her two little canine teeth were shiny.</p><p>“Then where are we going?”</p><p>She went forward and held her senior ‘s hand. Her big eyes blinked. “Well, actually, anywhere is fine…”</p><p>“Go outside.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pointed at the sky in the distance and the dimensional crack at the end of the map of the White Cave appeared in her mind.</p><p>“The Fourth Sword, the White Cave and those places. You can go and take a look.”</p><p>“There is the Fourth Sword?”</p><p>Mu Zixi was shocked. “Xu Xiaoshou, didn’t you say that you don’t want ‘the Fourth Sword’ anymore?”</p><p>“I used to be.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou replied with a smile. Her gaze looked through the void and seemed to see that pair of beautiful star pupils again.</p><p>“But now, I suddenly feel that if ‘the Fourth Sword’ fall into the hands of the Holy Divine Palace, it might be a bad thing.”</p><p>“HMM?”</p><p>Mu Zixi did not understand the best outcome. How could it be considered a bad thing? But she only asked, “But your ‘Black Scabbard’…”</p><p>“It was given away.”</p><p>“Yes.” Mu Zixi blinked her innocent eyes and nodded her head.</p><p>“Cursed, passive value, + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t say anything else.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the spatial vortex appeared.</p><p>In the distance, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes immediately revealed a look of envy.</p><p>After being imprisoned in the Abrogated Origin Residence for so long, how could he not yearn for freedom?</p><p>However, compared to freedom, Xu Xiaoshou felt that if he asked the great demon king, not only would he not get a positive answer, he would also ruin his future.</p><p>Stowaway!</p><p>She had to find a time to completely leave this Abrogated Origin Residence space.</p><p>Otherwise, as the “Path Pattern Initial Stone” settled here, the space became more stable.</p><p>She would never have a chance to escape.</p><p>“Then let’s go!”</p><p>Mu Zixi jumped into the space whirlpool.</p><p>As long as she was with Xu Xiaoji, she could go anywhere.</p><p>Xu Xiaoji took half a step forward, but she suddenly turned her head to look at Xu Xiaoji.</p><p>“Together?”</p><p>“Together?” Xu Xiaoshou pointed at himself in surprise, “Me?”</p><p>“Besides you, who else is there?”</p><p>“No, no…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself that this must be a plot of the great demon king.</p><p>But the desire for freedom urged him to slowly move his feet.</p><p>“Hurry up.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s body trembled, and he turned into a stone, pouncing into Xu Xiaoshou’s embrace at the speed of light.</p><p>“Aje.”</p><p>“Mama…”</p><p>With his hand holding Aje’s raw stone, the corners of Xu Xiaoshou’s lips curled up, and he finally stepped into the spatial vortex.</p><p>One step.</p><p>The sea of qi was born, and spiritual waves rippled through the rain.</p><p>Upper Spiritual Level!</p><p>This Upper Spiritual was the world’s new upper spirit!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
