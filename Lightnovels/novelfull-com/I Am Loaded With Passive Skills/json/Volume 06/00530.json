Aje crossed his arm and Jiao Tangtang’s powerful whip kick was blocked. His body was sent flying into the air.</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>After receiving the attack, Aje’s eyes shone with a red light. He was about to jump out and continue fighting.</p><p>“Stop.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly pressed him down and looked at the bewildered Jiao Tangtang in the sky. He said, “Why are you fighting? You didn’t fight before, and now you’re starting this?”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang’s eyes were filled with anger. “Xu Xiaoshou, I promised to play that stupid game with you, but in the end? You haven’t even finished what you said, and you want to leave already?”</p><p>“What did I say?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at her and said, “I told you to play the game first. We’ll talk about the rest later. Think about it carefully. Did I promise you to sign the Ghost Beast Contract after the game is over?”</p><p>“I didn’t!” He answered his own question.</p><p>“You!”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang thought about it carefully. It seemed that this guy had only made an ambiguous statement from the beginning.</p><p>However, she had already played that stupid game…</p><p>Just like that?</p><p>“So you want to go back on your word and waste my time?” Her eyes became dangerous.</p><p>No matter how powerful the people around Xu Xiaoshou were, if she really wanted to fight, she would definitely make this guy suffer.</p><p>“Go back on my word?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sneered, “No promises were made in the first place, so why would I go back on my word?”</p><p>“Then you’re courting death!”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang gave an angry rebuke, and black mist rose from her body once again.</p><p>“Threatened, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>“Whoa.”</p><p>Before Xu Xiaoshou could move, the three bodyguards in front and behind him shouted in unison. Jiao Tangtang’s soaring figure suddenly stopped in midair.</p><p>“Think carefully before you attack.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou persuaded and said, “Let’s not talk about a battle above the Sovereign Stage. It won’t take long for you to attract the attention of a Red Coat person. Just based on your identity as a ghost beast host body, can you withstand the consequences of being exposed?”</p><p>“I’ll drag you down with me!” Jiao Tangtang’s eyes were red.</p><p>“I’m not a ghost beast. Moreover, you won’t do this.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head. “No matter how big the matter is, it’s not as important as your mission. If you really came here with the determination to die, why did you have to waste your breath on me just now?”</p><p>Darn you, Xu Xiaoshou, you still know how to waste your breath!</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you’re very smart.”</p><p>“Praised, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Jiao Tangtang restrained all the anger in her body. She laughed and said, “Sure enough, Xin Gugu is right. Your ability to analyze the situation is far better than your combat ability.”</p><p>“You’re right. I didn’t come here to fight to the death with you.”</p><p>As she spoke, the beast skin roll in her hand flew away.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly caught it.</p><p>“I’ll give you the contract first. Whether you sign it or not is up to you. But let’s make a bet. I bet that even if you don’t sign it now, you’ll sign it yourself in the future,” said Jiao Tangtang.</p><p>“I don’t want it.”</p><p>It was as if Xu Xiaoshou had received a hot potato. Without thinking, he threw the contract and Greedy the Cat Spirit out.</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit picked up the contract in mid-air and flew to Xu Xiaoshou’s head with a whoosh.</p><p>Then, he threw the beast skin roll to Xu Xiaoshou’s hand, who was in a daze. He stuck out his tongue and licked his cheek.</p><p>“Meow! Meow!”</p><p>“Licked, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you can’t run away.” Jiao Tangtang smiled.</p><p>She could see that Greedy the Cat Spirit had fallen in love with Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Under such circumstances, no matter what Xu Xiaoshou did, the other party would not abandon him.</p><p>With this bond, whether to sign the contract or not, it was only a matter of time.</p><p>Moreover, she came to look for Xu Xiaoshou because this fellow’s current strength was insufficient. She needed Greedy the Cat Spirit’s help to break the situation.</p><p>Now that she looked at it.</p><p>There’s Aje and two super large white skeletons.</p><p>This strength completely surpassed the level of an ordinary Sovereign.</p><p>And… three Sovereigns!</p><p>“Keep the contract for yourself first. In any case, you really don’t need it now.”</p><p>As Jiao Tangtang spoke, she saw that Xu Xiaoshou was about to throw this thing away again. She hurriedly said, “If you don’t sign this thing, it’ll be no different from an ordinary treasure map on your body.”</p><p>“It’s impossible for Red Coats to find you through the contract. You can rest assured about that.”</p><p>“Then I can’t take it either.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou understood very well.</p><p>Once he kept this thing on him, there was a possibility that one day, he might not realize it or fall into a predicament that he couldn’t do anything about and it would then be used as a life-saving straw where he had no choice but to sign it.</p><p>In that case, wouldn’t he really become a ghost beast host body in the future?</p><p>Jiao Tangtang seemed to know what he was thinking and said, “When you really fall into a predicament and are unable to resolve it on your own, would you choose to die on the spot or become a ghost beast host body and live?”</p><p>“Die.” Xu Xiaoshou did not even think about it.</p><p>What kind of person was he?</p><p>During this period of contact, she had long learned to automatically block Xu Xiaoshou’s nonsense. She immediately said,</p><p>“Don’t delude yourself into thinking that you have many trump cards on you, so there will be no chance for you to use the contract.”</p><p>“When you connect with the ghost beasts, it is destined that you will have to fight with the Red Coat men for the rest of your life. They are not an ordinary force! What you have now…”</p><p>She pointed at Aje and the two white skeletons and said, “In the eyes of the Red Coat men, it is nothing.”</p><p>“If they really get into trouble, they will die even earlier than you. The only thing you can rely on is your… yes, innate cultivation.”</p><p>“Ha.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang sneered and continued, “Innate… before you grow up, if you are really caught, even if you are suspected to be a ghost beast, you will definitely die.”</p><p>“So, without the help of Greedy the Cat Spirit, you will never be able to escape.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was silent for a long time before he said, “You want to run away from me?”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>She was speechless for a moment.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou is so annoying! He must be poisonous!</p><p>The scene quieted down.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was surrounded by three bodyguards, actually listened.</p><p>It was undeniable that Jiao Tangtang’s words were very reasonable.</p><p>However, he still did not want to take this hot potato in his hands.</p><p>If he became a ghost beast host body, he was afraid that he would be forced onto a pirate ship, completely under the control of others.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, don’t hesitate anymore.”</p><p>“Ghost beast, it’s not as simple as you think.”</p><p>Seeing that Xu Xiaoshou was already showing signs of interest, Jiao Tangtang once again strengthened her tone and said, “This kind of ghost beast that was born from another extradimensional space, you can even treat it as a spiritual beast or a spirit pet.”</p><p>“There are no disadvantages to signing a contract with them. There are only benefits, as long as you don’t get…”</p><p>“As long as I don’t get what?” Xu Xiaoshou asked casually.</p><p>Jiao Tangtang stopped talking and shook her head, “I’ve said it before. If you don’t sign the contract, I won’t be able to reveal more information to you.”</p><p>“If you don’t reveal it, I won’t sign it.” Xu Xiaoshou’s temper flared up.</p><p>“Up to you.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang didn’t care anymore. “These rules don’t mean that I can tell you just because I want to. Rules are rules. I can’t…”</p><p>“Then strangle it.” Xu Xiaoshou grabbed Greedy the Cat Spirit’s neck.</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit’s hair stood on end.</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang was angered again. “Xu Xiaoshou, do you really think I don’t dare to kill you?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Xu, Xiao, Shou!”</p><p>“Called, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Present.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou exerted force on his hand, and Greedy the Cat Spirit cooperatively changed from a regular meow to a pained meow.</p><p>“Meow –”</p><p>“Meow –”</p><p>“Okay!”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang took a deep breath. “I’ll reveal some information to you.”</p><p>“Please go ahead.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou listened attentively.</p><p>Jiao Tangtang said, “A real ghost beast, an existence like Greedy the Cat Spirit in your hands, is the power that every major force craves.”</p><p>“This power is not evil, but it depends on how people use it.”</p><p>“This is like a weapon. It is innocent, but the user…”</p><p>“I understand the logic. Continue, don’t interrupt,” Xu Xiaoshou interrupted.</p><p>Darn it, darn it, darn it!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, you’d better not fall into my hands!</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang said calmly, “Well, this power is not only used by Xu Yue Grey Palace. The others are also using it.”</p><p>“Who?” Xu Xiaoshou already had an answer in her mind.</p><p>“Holy Divine Palace!”</p><p>“You’re not lying to me? Are you telling the truth?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>There was no change in the information column.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou closed his eyes heavily.</p><p>She was not lying.</p><p>In other words, all of this was real.</p><p>He believed that Jiao Tangtang would not have made a mistake at this time and had said “Red Coat” as “Holy Divine Palace”.</p><p>Even if she had made a mistake, the information column would have been able to detect it.</p><p>Then, this meant that the fact that Lu Ke was a Red Coat and a host body of a ghost beast was not an isolated case.</p><p>Such a situation might be very common in the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>Therefore, Yu Zhiwen was only worried about the ghost beast aura that came out of Lu Ke’s body and was not shocked.</p><p>“Therefore, the Holy Divine Palace claimed to exterminate the ghost beast under the banner of justice.”</p><p>“On the other hand, they secretly used the power of the ghost beast and kept it a secret.”</p><p>“What are they trying to do?”</p><p>“Is this really the work of the number one force on the continent?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered in his heart and began to doubt his previous judgment.</p><p>He felt that the truth might not be that simple.</p><p>But if he didn’t become the host body of a ghost beast, it would seem that there would always be such an insurmountable gap in front of him. No one would really reveal such information to him.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Xiaoshou nodded and stored Greedy the Cat Spirit and the beast skin scroll into his Yuan Mansion.</p><p>He chose to accept it.</p><p>Although he really wanted to use his own method to find out the truth of this world.</p><p>But if it really didn’t work, when necessary, he might have to do what he had to do!</p><p>“This is a wise choice.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang smiled as she floated down from the sky. She stood far away from Aje and said, “When you have thought it through and signed the Ghost Beast Contract, come to the southern mountain range to find me.”</p><p>“At that time, I will answer whatever you ask.”</p><p>“If you have any needs, Xu Yue Grey Palace will definitely be able to satisfy them!”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou replied absent-mindedly. Suddenly, he felt that something was wrong.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“Any needs can be satisfied?”</p><p>He could not believe it.</p><p>He immediately used a flirtatious gaze to glance at the woman in front of him. The question in his eyes was self-evident.</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang nodded with a smile. There was no hint of shyness. She said firmly, “Yes, anything, including turning you into a man.”</p><p>So exaggerated?</p><p>He did not choose to use words to fight against Jiao Tangtang. Instead, he was shocked by this woman’s tone.</p><p>I’m just a mere Xu Xiaoshou. How can I…</p><p>His thoughts immediately turned around. Xu Xiaoshou quickly thought of the way Jiao Tangtang and Xin Gugu addressed the little fat cat… Greedy the Cat Spirit!</p><p>“Is it because of Greedy the Cat Spirit?” He turned his head and asked.</p><p>“Well, if not for it, could it be for you?” Jiao Tangtang rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Is the position of Greedy the Cat Spirit very high?” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t believe it at all.</p><p>Little fat cat, what right do you have to have to be more important than me, Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Jiao Tangtang covered her red lips and giggled, “Xu Xiaoshou, you only need to know that if Greedy the Cat Spirit dies in your hands, the Holy Divine Palace won’t be able to protect you even if they come.”</p><p>Without saying a word, he took out the little fat cat from his Yuan Mansion and threw it over.</p><p>“Sorry, I can’t afford to offend you, how can I afford to hide?”</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit instantly felt wronged.</p><p>It didn’t understand why this human always despised it. It had clearly done nothing wrong, and it wasn’t greedy anymore…</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Seeing the little white cat flying back, Jiao Tangtang’s eyes were still twitching. She said angrily, “You’d better show some respect. This is a bond that you can’t get rid of.”</p><p>“I’ll kill…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wanted to say, “If I kill it, won’t the bond be broken?” But when he grabbed the fur collar on the fat cat’s neck again, he suddenly had no way to do it.</p><p>Darn it! So you had such a complicated background?</p><p>Even the entire Holy Divine Palace can’t protect me?</p><p>I, Xu Xiaoshou, don’t believe it!</p><p>“Kill it.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang didn’t care anymore. She could finally see it.</p><p>It wasn’t that Xu Xiaoshou was soft-hearted, but if it wasn’t to the extreme, this guy could completely ignore it.</p><p>But now…</p><p>“I don’t want it anymore, okay? I really can’t afford to offend you. I’m just a mere Xu Xiaoshou, what right do I have!” Xu Xiaoshou said with a sad face, “I’m just an Innate…”</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>Jiao Tangtang also fell silent.</p><p>You’re just an Innate, but I, Jiao Tangtang, have never met an Innate like you in my entire life!</p><p>This little boy, these two white skeletons, and you yourself have completely surpassed the Innate Stage…</p><p>No. He might have already surpassed the combat strength of a Master!</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit had spent a lot of time and effort to come all the way from the southern mountain range. In the end, he only had eyes for you. There really was a reason.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, let’s not talk about this anymore. Let’s just leave it at that.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang sighed and didn’t want to say anymore.</p><p>She looked at the sky and knew that she had already wasted too much time. She asked, “I still have one last thing to ask you.”</p><p>“Can you not say it. I have to say…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, be serious. Your current situation is very dangerous. This matter concerns your life and safety!” Jiao Tangtang had mastered the method to communicate with Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately snapped out of it. “You’re threatening me again?”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang ignored him and said, “I should have told you that Xin Gugu and I came here because we have a mission that is more important than getting the Fourth Sword.”</p><p>“Hmm.” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to mess around anymore. He looked more serious and said seriously, “Can you not tell me about your mission?”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>If it didn’t implicate you in the end, do you think I would want to come to you?</p><p>She roared in her heart, but she didn’t dare to say it out loud.</p><p>Otherwise, who knew how Xu Xiaoshou would change the topic later!</p><p>Jiao Tangtang went straight to the point. “Feng Yujin, Elder Feng, do you know him?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>“Alright, let me rephrase it. Have you ever seen a ghost beast with the seal attribute?” Jiao Tangtang continued to ask.</p><p>Thud!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Grey mist figure?</p><p>Why the hell am I involved with you again?</p><p>“I don’t know him.” He shook his head like a rattle-drum.</p><p>“You know him.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang gave him a cold look. “I entered the White Cave and followed the seal aura that Elder Feng leaked all the way to the Spirit Fusion Swamp.”</p><p>“The explosion there was obviously caused by you!”</p><p>“And the last place where the seal aura disappeared was not far from the Spirit Fusion Swamp.”</p><p>“I also found your aura there…”</p><p>She pointed at the Ice Blue White Skeleton behind Xu Xiaoshou. “Or rather, your aura.”</p><p>Frozen power?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately understood.</p><p>So after entering the White Cave, Jiao Tangtang had followed him all the way here and finally intercepted him at this place?</p><p>“Okay, I admit that I did have some dealings with the seal ghost beast, but what does this have to do with you?” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t plan to hide it anymore.</p><p>“Elder Feng had contact with you?” Jiao Tangtang’s eyes suddenly lit up with joy.</p><p>“Don’t be happy too early.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and wanted to retell the scene, but he suddenly stopped.</p><p>“Tell me what Elder Feng, the seal ghost beast, and your mission are all about.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang’s expression froze.</p><p>“If you don’t tell me, I won’t tell you about the grey mist figure!”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang suddenly felt as if she had been forcefully fed to a fly.</p><p>Wasn’t this what she had said to Xu Xiaoshou just now?</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“I’ll say.”</p><p>She said helplessly, “I rushed here from the southern domain because I received a mission from the higher-ups. My goal is to find Elder Feng, the seal ghost beast that you mentioned.”</p><p>“Wait.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou asked in confusion, “How can you be so sure that the seal ghost beast that I mentioned is the same target as that mission of yours?”</p><p>“The seal attribute is rarely seen in this world. Even if I’m looking for the wrong one, the seal ghost beast that was born in the White Cave is something that I have to bring back,” Jiao Tangtang replied.</p><p>“Okay, continue.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded and didn’t comment.</p><p>“That’s it.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang spread her hands. “This is my entire mission. What else can I say? The rest is up to you.”</p><p>That’s it? It’s so short?</p><p>I didn’t get any information out of you, and you’re telling me it’s over?</p><p>Forget it!</p><p>“Then let me ask you a question…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered for a moment and didn’t continue to dwell on this matter. He asked, “Elder Feng, is he a person?”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang narrowed her eyes.</p><p>“I’m sorry, this involves insider information. I can only tell you after you’ve signed the Ghost Beast Contract.”</p><p>“Okay.” Xu Xiaoshou raised a finger. “Then how about this, let’s play a game…”</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes!”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang instantly became impatient and said angrily, “He’s a human, alright! I don’t have that much time to play that kind of retarded game with a kid like you. Hurry up and tell me!”</p><p>He’s a human…</p><p>If it was any other time, Xu Xiaoshou would have gone all out to argue with the other party about whether he had grown up or not.</p><p>But now, he was just looking at the message window in silence.</p><p>“Urged, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>There was no “Deceived”…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was going crazy!</p><p>This also meant that what Jiao Tangtang said in her seemingly angry reply was all true.</p><p>That Feng Yujin was really a human!</p><p>But he was also a ghost beast!</p><p>Then, weren’t the two types of ghost beasts obvious?</p><p>A human could also be a ghost beast?</p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Xiaoshou felt a chill down his spine. At this moment, he felt his scalp go numb.</p><p>This was… impossible!</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>Yes, there was another possible explanation.</p><p>The grey mist figure and the Feng Yujin that Jiao Tangtang was talking about were not the same person.</p><p>And this could perfectly solve his misunderstanding, which was the secret that Jiao Tangtang did not want to tell him even if he was beaten to death.</p><p>But… was it valid?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was powerless.</p><p>The seal attribute was rarely seen in the world. This kind of self-delusion might really be something that he could not accept at the moment, so he forcefully answered.</p><p>The probability of its existence was not even one in ten thousand.</p><p>“Ghost beasts are also humans…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou closed his eyes in pain.</p><p>He suddenly felt that this world was so comical and ridiculous.</p><p>On one hand, the Red Coat man was crazily surrounding the human-shaped ghost beasts.</p><p>On the other hand, they were using this power.</p><p>They even kept it a secret…</p><p>No! It was not “kept it a secret”!</p><p>It was the news leaked by the Holy Divine Palace that was not the truth at all!</p><p>In the eyes of the people, the ghost beasts had long become synonymous with evil, cruelty, and demons.</p><p>It was not just the people.</p><p>Even the Night Guardians in the Red Coat division had the same opinion.</p><p>One could imagine how big the scope of the brainwashing was.</p><p>How could the real conflict be resolved under such prejudice? And how could he, who had been sucked into such a whirlpool, be on his own?</p><p>“No, this is only a conjecture.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou calmed down. No matter how terrifying the conjecture was, it was only a conjecture. If it was not proven, it would never be true.</p><p>Moreover, the information that he had imagined based on the tip of the iceberg was very likely that there was another side that he had never come into contact with before.</p><p>What was the truth?</p><p>“You might be disappointed…”</p><p>With a sigh, Xu Xiaoshou was not in the mood to be confused. Instead, he spoke frankly, “The last time I came into contact with the seal ghost beast, I was not the only one present.”</p><p>“Oh?” Jiao Tangtang’s heart was burning with anxiety. She did not notice the change in Xu Xiaoshou’s mood.</p><p>“Then who else was there?” She asked.</p><p>“The Red Coat Night Guardian, and…”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou felt that the situation was a little serious. He said with difficulty, “The Seventh Chief of the Saint Servant, the Storyteller!”</p><p>With a boom, Jiao Tangtang’s brain seemed to have been struck by lightning. In an instant, it was completely blank.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated for a moment, then took a step back and comforted her, “Sis…”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang covered her head and shouted. For a moment, her thoughts were in a mess.</p><p>“Storyteller?”</p><p>“How could he be there? That’s impossible!”</p><p>“This is reality.” Xu Xiaoshou took another step back and moved Aje in front of him. He said, “There’s an old saying, I don’t know if I should say it…”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>“That’s what it said. The ideal is very full, reality…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, shut up!”</p><p>“Scolded, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>The atmosphere suddenly became dead silent.</p><p>After shutting his mouth for a long while, Xu Xiaoshou could no longer hold it in. “You said before that almost all the major factions want to possess the power of a ghost beast.”</p><p>“Then, the seal attribute is so rare, Saint Servant…”</p><p>With a “buzz”, the purple chain on Jiao Tangtang’s body disintegrated. Black mist enveloped her entire body, and the roaring of lions from the east shook the void.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, can you shut your mouth for me? Do you believe me…”</p><p>“There’s a piece of good news. I don’t know if I should say it or not.” After Xu Xiaoshou said this, he immediately stitched up his mouth.</p><p>“Say it!”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang regained her composure and swept her cold gaze across. The temperature in the air suddenly dropped, and it was even scarier than the Three Days Frozen Calamity.</p><p>“Speak!” The corner of Jiao Tangtang’s mouth twitched.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!” Jiao Tangtang had really gone crazy!</p><p>“Called, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Didn’t you tell me to shut up?” Xu Xiaoshou was amused. He had finally avenged himself for being choked earlier.</p><p>Woman, I told you not to tell me your secrets.</p><p>I’m going to piss you off!</p><p>“Ambushed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>The information bar jumped.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned pale with fright. He instantly took a step into the sky and jumped to an extremely high altitude.</p><p>There was an explosion below.</p><p>Obviously, Aje and Jiao Tangtang were fighting again.</p><p>“Ambushed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou almost couldn’t react on time.</p><p>“Don’t fight, I’ll tell you!”</p><p>He kept on firing and his words were as precise as a machine gun.</p><p>“When I ran away earlier, the Storyteller was sealed in the ice, so the seal ghost beast might not have fallen into the hands of the Saint Servant.”</p><p>“Besides, I don’t think he can take down the grey mist figure with just a Red Coat.”</p><p>“You don’t believe me? If you don’t believe me, you can immediately go and ask the Red Coat. His name is Night Guardian… ouch!”</p><p>“Darn it! I said don’t fight!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
