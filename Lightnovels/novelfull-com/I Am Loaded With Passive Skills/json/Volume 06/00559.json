It seemed like he was going to make a move, but in reality, it was all psychological suppression.”</p><p>“This person, his true strength hasn’t even been fully unleashed once…”</p><p>“Yes! Once!”</p><p>“Is it because he’s disdainful, or is it really not?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen pondered and felt that she had figured out a little possibility.</p><p>If the second son of the Saint Servant only displayed this level of ability…</p><p>Relying on the Infernal Original Seed, the three days frozen calamity..</p><p>It seemed that if it was really Xu Xiaoshou, he would be able to do it?</p><p>“The most important thing is that they are too alike. Although the Saint Servant said that he didn’t know them… but if the two of them don’t know each other at all and only rely on an insignificant opportunity to form a bond…”</p><p>“Can they be so alike?”</p><p>Thinking up to this point, Yu Zhiwen was already certain in her heart.</p><p>Even if the second son of the Saint Servant couldn’t be Xu Xiaoshou, it must have something to do with him.</p><p>After all, judging from his actions just now…</p><p>If she thought about it from another angle, she faintly felt that he was protecting his own people.</p><p>“Do you want Xu Xiaoshou to have nothing to do with the Saint Servant…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen did not turn around, but she could already feel Lan Ling’s encouraging gaze.</p><p>She had given everything to her.</p><p>Was this the feeling of trust?</p><p>If she still made a mistake in her judgment under such circumstances..</p><p>Her thoughts paused.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen knew that the game had already begun.</p><p>At that moment, she had no way out.</p><p>In front of her, she could only go all out!</p><p>..</p><p>“Since Senior has already said this, then I’ll admit it. Three questions, three lives.”</p><p>Ignoring the resentful gazes behind her, Yu Zhiwen continued, “But you also said that you’re not a person who doesn’t follow the rules.”</p><p>“Then, since it’s a game, according to the rules, there will definitely be a win or loss.”</p><p>“If we only ask three questions, we will have to sacrifice three lives.”</p><p>“The arena is a game of results. There is no winning or losing.”</p><p>“In other words, no matter how good the girl is… no matter how sharp the questions are, she will still lose.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen paused and looked. She said without any fear, “Then, how do you decide if we win?”</p><p>“PFFT!”</p><p>The Storyteller immediately laughed out loud.</p><p>You still want to talk about rules when playing with Second Brother?</p><p>It was already good enough for you to ask questions, but you actually still want to win!</p><p>However, it had to be said that Yu Zhiwen’s thorough consideration of all of this had already caused the Storyteller to think highly of her.</p><p>In such a tense atmosphere, she was actually able to analyze so calmly and even contend with an expert of the current era without any disorder. It was truly admirable.</p><p>“What a pity, she’s just a girl.”</p><p>The Storyteller shook his head, but in the end, he wasn’t too interested.</p><p>..</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that Yu Zhiwen was indeed extremely intelligent.</p><p>But after two consecutive waves of attacks, he still had a whole new level of respect for this girl.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, he waved his hand.</p><p>“A very good ‘question’.”</p><p>The Red-robed crowd didn’t have the time to wait for a long time before they were instantly crushed by Xu Xiaoshou’s specially emphasized ‘question’.</p><p>Thinking about it carefully.</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s tone just now seemed to be really skeptical..</p><p>“How do we determine whether we win?”</p><p>But, this also counted?</p><p>For a moment, the people in red-robed, including Yu Zhiwen, were so angry that their livers hurt, but they were helpless.</p><p>“Resisted, passive points + 18.”</p><p>“Cursed, passive points + 16.”</p><p>“As for the definition of winning or losing…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lowered his head and pondered for a moment, then said slowly, “As long as your question can interest me a little, then you win.”</p><p>He spoke with conviction, and Red Coat’s face indeed turned green.</p><p>This subjective judgment again?</p><p>This was simply playing rogue!</p><p>“Then, what kind of question…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen subconsciously followed the straw hat old man’s words, but was suddenly startled awake.</p><p>Damn it!</p><p>So it was all guided by his words?</p><p>This old fox was too cunning!</p><p>If he really asked another question, wouldn’t the game be directly terminated?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen immediately changed the topic, “The interest that I think I’m interested in should be the same as Senior’s. It’s when you don’t dare to answer my question directly that you’re interested!”</p><p>She deliberately emphasized her tone in order to prevent the straw hat old man in front of her from saying, “The game is over.”.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes shone with a gratified light.</p><p>“Very good, you are very smart.”</p><p>“But people live in this world. Every step of growth requires a price.”</p><p>“No matter who you are, or what your background is, no one has the obligation to teach you and lecture you without holding back, without charging any fees.”</p><p>As everyone listened, they already felt that something was wrong.</p><p>As expected, in the next second, Xu Xiaoshou said the most unpleasant words.</p><p>“Today, you little girl have grown up and know how to speak, but the price is between you red-robed and the others…”</p><p>“The second person is already dead.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s expression instantly changed.</p><p>Lan Ling, Night Guardian, and the others were collectively speechless.</p><p>The faces of the red-robed people behind them all turned ashen, and they once again became anxious.</p><p>“Cursed, passive points + 12.”</p><p>“Criticized, passive points + 18.”</p><p>..</p><p>“The third question.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled as he extended his middle finger and retracted his thumb and index finger.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen didn’t dare to speak carelessly at this moment.</p><p>Only god knows if she accidentally said something at this moment, this old man straw hat would be able to end the game and kill people wantonly.</p><p>If that was the case, then she, Yu Zhiwen, would have committed a great sin!</p><p>“I have some speculations, I don’t know what to say…”</p><p>“Bah!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen spat heavily.</p><p>This damned upbringing!</p><p>With a red face, she did not care about the other party’s reaction and directly said,</p><p>“I won’t hide it from Senior. The friend that I mentioned earlier, Xu Xiaoshou, should be here.”</p><p>“When we were controlling theGreat Array earlier, we encountered a wave of attacks.”</p><p>“And if Senior Lan Ling and my judgment aren’t wrong, then there should be someone trying to seize control of the Great Array.”</p><p>The Storyteller’s brows suddenly moved.</p><p>It was very obscure.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat when he saw it.</p><p>He immediately used his spiritual senses to look inside and looked at the Information Bar that he had almost forgotten.</p><p>As expected.</p><p>As he flipped through the information bar, there were a series of “Cursed”, “Cursed”, and “Resisted, passive points +”. Occasionally, there were a few “Suspected”.</p><p>Furthermore, the passive points were always “+ 1”.</p><p>During this period of time, facing so many big shots at the same time, Xu Xiaoshou found it difficult to pay attention to the small details in the information bar.</p><p>It was only at this moment that he noticed this crucial information!</p><p>“Oh my God, could it be that Little Yu has already guessed something?”</p><p>“How can she be so daring…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was instantly horrified, and his heart couldn’t help but beat faster.</p><p>He wanted to stop this girl from continuing to speak.</p><p>However, in his “Perception”, the storyteller already had a rather interested look on his face.</p><p>Obviously, this guy had connected it to his previous attempt to break through the ancient book’s space and escape from this place.</p><p>Moreover!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen had previously said that if he didn’t dare to answer her question directly, it meant that… he had lost.</p><p>Winning or losing wasn’t important at this moment.</p><p>However, under the precondition of being emphasized in advance, if he still didn’t dare to face it, then he must have a ghost in his heart.</p><p>Intangible, it was equivalent to acknowledging Yu Zhiwen’s words.</p><p>“Good guy!”</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou’s horizons were really broadened.</p><p>“You didn’t pay much for the tuition fees, you little girl. Your academic results actually improved by leaps and bounds…”</p><p>It had to be said that at this moment, Xu Xiaoshou was a little flustered.</p><p>He felt that the situation was a little chaotic.</p><p>But at this moment, there was no way to stop it.</p><p>“So?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou asked back indifferently, perfectly concealing the various emotions that were surging in his heart.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen did not reply.</p><p>She had learned to be smarter.</p><p>This old man in front of her must have an unclear relationship with Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Otherwise, it was impossible for such a subtle trick to be so similar.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen, who had already learned not to reply to Xu Xiaoshou’s words, directly regarded the old man in the straw hat as Xu Xiaoshou at this moment and said to herself,</p><p>“According to the information from our red-robed, in addition to my own judgment, it is impossible for there to be an expert at the spirit array master level or above near the Lijian Grassland.”</p><p>“And without these conditions, no one can successfully touch the core of the Great Array in such a short time.”</p><p>“Even if the core of this Great Array was copied by Senior Storyteller.”</p><p>As she spoke, she turned her gaze to the Storyteller.</p><p>The interest in the Storyteller’s eyes grew.</p><p>“Little girl, you’re very powerful. You can actually see that this Great Array isn’t the other array.”</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>He proudly nodded. “It’s different from the ‘Thirty-Six Heavens Sealed Array’ in the White Cave. It took them a whole day and a half to successfully copy all the great arrays here.”</p><p>With a glance, it was done.</p><p>Everyone felt their scalps go numb.</p><p>It was obvious that the storyteller wasn’t even an ordinary spirit array caster.</p><p>But he used the ancient book’s space to forcibly copy all the path patterns of the Divine Secrets Array. It was the type that could be operated!</p><p>“Only one and a half days…”</p><p>Even as a divine sorcerer, Yu Zhiwen was shocked.</p><p>Imprinting the complicated Heaven and Earth Great Array in such a short time, wasn’t this inhuman?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned.</p><p>His mood at this moment was completely not on the topic that the storyteller had changed.</p><p>There was something wrong with Yu Zhiwen!</p><p>The way she spoke had a sense of déjà vu. He did not know where he had felt it before, as if something was brewing.</p><p>But at this moment, the things that she was talking about were one after another.</p><p>If he did not connect them together, he would not be able to understand her final meaning.</p><p>“What exactly are you trying to express?” Xu Xiaoshou did not interrupt her in the end.</p><p>After all, if she admitted defeat in advance…</p><p>The arena might end in tragedy.</p><p>“What I’m trying to say…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was secretly glad that she wasn’t interrupted.</p><p>The old man in the straw hat didn’t stop her, so no matter what the final result was…</p><p>At least, she tried her best.</p><p>“It’s just a hunch.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen said calmly, “I still have the same words. I have a friend, his name is Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>“All the prerequisites mentioned before can be applied to anyone, but to him, they are all invalid!”</p><p>“Oh?” The Storyteller’s curiosity was immediately piqued. The figure of the young man who broke out of his ancient book’s space and fled for his life appeared in front of him.</p><p>Was he really that outstanding?</p><p>“Expected, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>Without waiting for the straw hat old man to react, Yu Zhiwen knew that she couldn’t stop, so she sped up and said,</p><p>“My friend is very outstanding. Elder Night Guardian has seen it and acknowledged it.”</p><p>She pointed at the Red-robed Night Guardian and said continuously, “My friend once broke part of the blueprint of the ‘Thirty-six heavens sealed array’ at the City Lord Mansion of Tiansang City with a glance.”</p><p>“And a spirit array caster with such a foundation is also a high-grade spirit array caster who has touched the divine secret technique. As long as he uses an item as a support, he can control the Heaven Sealing Array in a short period of time!”</p><p>“That is…”</p><p>“Wu!”</p><p>As Yu Zhiwen spoke, her eyes suddenly bulged and her words were completely choked, as if she was under great pressure.</p><p>In the next second.</p><p>“Pu!”</p><p>Her knees crashed into the air and she spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Zhiwen!” Lan Ling cried out in surprise.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. This sudden change..</p><p>When they suddenly turned around, they saw that second brother of the Saint Servant’s pair of terrifying black eyes were staring fixedly at Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>“Shameless!”</p><p>Lan Ling directly cursed.</p><p>In the game, she actually interrupted him in advance and even made such a vicious move against a junior.</p><p>Was this the bearing of a powerful expert in this world?</p><p>“Second Brother!”</p><p>The Storyteller suddenly shouted loudly, and his tone was already somewhat impolite.</p><p>He was also frightened by Yu Zhiwen’s words.</p><p>For some reason, the box-shaped object that second brother had taken out from underground suddenly appeared in his mind.</p><p>And when he first discovered Second Brother, Luo Leilei’s insignificant reminder seemed to be directly magnified at this moment.</p><p>Everything seemed to be in a line.</p><p>“Second Brother, let her speak. What exactly is that thing?” The Storyteller stared straight at his Second Brother.</p><p>“Suspected, passive points + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou ignored it.</p><p>How could he let Yu Zhiwen speak?</p><p>Sure enough, his premonition wouldn’t be wrong.</p><p>This girl was crazy.</p><p>She had grown too fast.</p><p>She had actually reached the point where she could use words to trap him step by step.</p><p>After three days of separation, he would treat her with new respect.</p><p>The ancient people were truly not deceiving him!</p><p>..</p><p>“Cough cough, cough…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen wiped the blood at the corner of her lips. She felt the aura that should have been enough to crush everyone present, but when it landed on her body, she faintly felt as if she had been stopped.</p><p>She tugged at her red lips that were overflowing with blood and was actually smiling.</p><p>“S-senior, you’ve lost.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen struggled to say this sentence again. She called him Senior.</p><p>In her eyes, it was already the same as her peers.</p><p>No matter how much she didn’t Xin.</p><p>At this moment, she already knew.</p><p>This person who dared to wantonly scold and act recklessly in front of so many cutting path and more than a dozen sovereign thrones was really… Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“How dare he…”</p><p>“How dare he? !”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s heart was filled with mixed feelings.</p><p>It turned out that Xu Xiaoshou had really arrived at this place ahead of time.</p><p>He was everywhere!</p><p>“Impressed, passive points + 1.”</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou saw this message, he already understood something.</p><p>He ignored the furious crowd. At this moment, he only wanted to understand what had happened to Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>She was clearly just a silly and sweet girl..</p><p>“Who taught you these things? Was It also your extraordinary master? Have you been lying to me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that the experience he had with this girl was somewhat unreal.</p><p>Did people really have to wait until they were separated before they could see the truth clearly?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was stunned.</p><p>What did she hear?</p><p>Telepathic Communication? !</p><p>Since when did Xu Xiaoshou know telepathic communication?</p><p>She looked around for a while, but no one noticed.</p><p>Obviously, it was really Xu Xiaoshou’s voice!</p><p>At this moment, Yu Zhiwen smiled.</p><p>Her starry eyes curved, and her pretty face felt dizzy.</p><p>Under the heavy pressure, she actually straightened her body and stared straight at the old man.</p><p>It was not telepathic communication.</p><p>She raised her chin, and her stubborn voice spread throughout the whole place.</p><p>“It’s still the same… I have a friend, his name is Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>“He taught me!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
