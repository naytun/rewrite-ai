Have You Asked!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou’s last word fell, the Night Guardian finally gave up on the last glimmer of hope in his heart. He stepped through the air and shot out explosively.</p><p>Refuse?</p><p>If he had nothing to hide, why would he be afraid?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou repeatedly rejected him. Even if it was as he said, the connection between him and the ghost beast was not as excessive as he had imagined.</p><p>However, there must be something!</p><p>And as long as there was something.</p><p>As a Red Coat, it was his duty to take down Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“Night Coverage.”</p><p>Accompanied by a low shout, the Night Guardian turned into a pure black light and directly drilled towards Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>How could Xu Xiaoshou dare to be careless?</p><p>This was the Peak of Cutting Path!</p><p>This was the first time in his life that he faced a Cutting Path expert at his peak, and he was even one of the best. How could he dare to relax?</p><p>“Ding Ling, Ding Ling…”</p><p>The ice lotus petal on his palm vibrated, and then Xu Xiaoshou suddenly pulled.</p><p>“Ice Chamber Cage!”</p><p>With an order, the huge hailstones that fell from the sky were instantly summoned.</p><p>The majestic power of the frozen power whistled out from the ice flame, connecting all the hailstones and instantly enveloping the entire space in front of him.</p><p>“Condense!”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking.</p><p>“Crack crack –”</p><p>A huge ice cage completely confined the black shadow that was the Night Guardian’s incarnation.</p><p>This “Ice Chamber Cage” move, was inspired by Zhao Shu.</p><p>He still remembered that when he was in the Inner Yard of the Tiansang Spirit Palace, Yuan Tou and Zhao Shu came looking for him in the small forest. The latter had used a similar ice-type method to trap him.</p><p>Nobody was around to help him and he couldn’t escape.</p><p>Even his cries for help could not be transmitted out.</p><p>This move, the Ice Chamber Cage, which was condensed from the power of the Three Days Frozen Calamity, was accompanied by the terrifying frozen power.</p><p>It was many times stronger than Zhao Shu’s move.</p><p>Of course, to prevent the situation where he was attacked from the inside, Xu Xiaoshou did not seal himself into the ice layer to fight.</p><p>His brain must have been stuck before he chose to fight the Night Guardian, right?</p><p>That was a Cutting Path!</p><p>He was not going to engage in an actual fight.</p><p>If he could seal it and seize the time to escape, that would be enough.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>He urged in his heart.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to delay.</p><p>Even though he had dealt with the Night Guardian many times, Xu Xiaoshou did not know what exactly this old man’s ability was.</p><p>And looking at the appearance of that shadow just now…</p><p>It could only be said that it was very troublesome!</p><p>“The power of darkness…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of a person with a black beard.</p><p>On one hand, he unleashed the frozen power, continuously increasing the thickness of the ice layer, to imprison the Night Guardian.</p><p>On the other hand, he raised his head to look at the sky, and in an instant, he unleashed the power that belonged to the Heaven and Earth Oven to remove the power of imprisonment.</p><p>After doing all this, his entire body shot up into the void.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>However, it was as if he had touched an invisible barrier.</p><p>When his body broke through to a height of over a thousand feet, Xu Xiaoshou was knocked back by the space and fell.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>He knew that the Night Guardian might choose to seal the void ahead of time.</p><p>Therefore, the force of this collision was a full-force sprint!</p><p>However, even with Recoil and Strengthen techniques, he still couldn’t break through the spatial barrier.</p><p>On the contrary, he was blasted into a mess.</p><p>“Cutting Path…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had a headache.</p><p>How was he going to fight?</p><p>It was on a completely different level from the Power of the Sovereign!</p><p>He flipped his hand and took out the exquisite stone. Xu Xiaoshou wanted to pinch it down.</p><p>Even if it was a spatial barrier, if it was spatial teleportation, he should be able to ignore it, right?</p><p>As he thought of this, a mocking voice came from below.</p><p>“Enough, Xu Xiaoshou. It’s useless to struggle anymore. Can’t you see that I’m still here?”</p><p>The grey mist figure’s voice was filled with ridicule. “The exquisite stone was created by the Red Coat. Do you think that under the circumstances where the other party thinks that you’re a ghost beast, the exquisite stone can still be used?”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but berate him.</p><p>It didn’t matter if this fellow was just watching from the sidelines, but it had to add fuel to the fire.</p><p>Only the heavens knew that the suspicion that the Night Guardian had in his heart was most likely because of the few words that this fellow had said at the side.</p><p>“Crack crack –”</p><p>The sound of ice cracking suddenly came from below.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou activated his Perception and could easily see that the black figure within the ice layer was desperately drilling towards a certain spot.</p><p>Even a large amount of frozen power had been shifted in that direction by him.</p><p>The Night Guardian did not care about it and he only wanted to break through the ice layer.</p><p>“But… just this?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly glanced at the ice sculpture of that frozen the red-dressed man not far away. He vaguely felt that the power released by the Night Guardian at this moment did not seem to be as powerful as he had imagined.</p><p>However, he could not care less.</p><p>“You, grey mist figure, don’t just stand there.”</p><p>“If I, Xu Xiaoshou cannot escape today. You will be next.”</p><p>“I brought you out because of Mo Mo. Are you just going to stand there and watch?” Xu Xiaoshou looked at it coldly.</p><p>The grey mist figure sneered. “Brought me out?”</p><p>“Are you mistaken? At the last moment, if not for my mercy, you would have died in the spatial fragment!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not be bothered to explain to him that he too could pass through the space node.</p><p>He pointed at the invisible confinement in the void. “Do you want to do it?”</p><p>“I can’t break it.”</p><p>The grey mist figure said lazily, “I can leave the spatial barrier to you. I know you can break it. I’ll help you with that red dress guy.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. “I can’t break it.”</p><p>“Yes, you can.”</p><p>The grey mist figure smiled and said, “Just because you can’t break it doesn’t mean that your pet can’t!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately clenched his fists.</p><p>This grey mist figure deserved to be taught a lesson.</p><p>If he, Xu Xiaoshou, wanted to expose Aje in front of the Red Coat, he would have taken it out long ago.</p><p>However, it was obvious.</p><p>If he didn’t do something now, the grey mist figure wouldn’t help to deal with the Night Guardian no matter what.</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded. He grabbed the black stone in front of his chest and threw it out. “Go, cut it for me!”</p><p>A stream of light shot out. At the instant Aje was thrown out, he transformed into a huge monk’s knife and smashed into the spatial barrier.</p><p>“Pa da Pa da…”</p><p>In an instant, the void was covered with spider webs.</p><p>In the next second, Aje exerted more strength, and a yellowish aura seemed to emerge from it.</p><p>With a rumbling sound, the space was completely shattered.</p><p>“Come back.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a step forward and directly flew into the air, pulling Aje into his embrace.</p><p>…</p><p>“This is?”</p><p>Trapped in the ice chamber, the Night Guardian was startled.</p><p>He held back his strength for Xu Xiaoshou because he wanted to see what kind of method this fellow would use to break through his space blockade.</p><p>If nothing went wrong, the seal ghost beast that had successfully parasitized this space wouldn’t be able to break through it.</p><p>If it wanted to break through it, it would have to pay a huge price.</p><p>As for Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>If he wanted to break through it, he would have to transform into his ghost beast form. He would also have to pay the price of his physical body being crippled to break through the spatial barrier.</p><p>However!</p><p>“What the hell was that monk’s knife?”</p><p>The Night Guardian was confused.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not display his ghost beast ability. Instead, he took out this monk’s knife that was filled with vitality. This greatly exceeded his expectations.</p><p>Not only that.</p><p>Looking at this monk’s knife, the Night Guardian felt a strange sense of familiarity.</p><p>He was certain that he had never seen this type of weapon on Xu Xiaoshou before.</p><p>Then, where did this sense of familiarity come from?</p><p>Ever since he found out that the explosion was caused by Xu Xiaoshou, he no longer dared to doubt his intuition as a Cutting Path.</p><p>As he thought about it, his heart suddenly palpitated.</p><p>“Divine… Puppet?”</p><p>Such spiritual energy and the fluctuation of the Way of the Heavens’ energy movement…</p><p>Wasn’t it the Divine Puppet’s undulations that he had come into contact with when he was still a White-clothed that belonged solely to the research of the Path Division?</p><p>“That’s not right!”</p><p>“Not at all!”</p><p>The Night Guardian instantly denied his own judgment.</p><p>Although the Divine Puppet could transform, it was only a part of it. For example, it could transform its arm into a weapon to attack. How could it have the ability to completely transform?</p><p>As for the space blockade that contained the Power of the Higher Void…</p><p>How could it be cut open by an ordinary Divine Puppet’s transformation weapon?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, how much more are you hiding from me?”</p><p>The Night Guardian gritted his teeth.</p><p>Even though he could tell that it wasn’t a Divine Puppet developed by the Path Division.</p><p>This aura definitely had something to do with the Divine Puppet.</p><p>In other words…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was also suspected of stealing the Holy Divine Palace’s internal secrets?</p><p>“Hand of Heaven Punisher!”</p><p>He shouted and dark lines appeared on his hands.</p><p>The Night Guardian who was no longer holding back shot out two streaks of black light and shattered the Ice Chamber Cage in an instant, bringing him to the outside space.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>He shouted and disappeared from where he was.</p><p>The void’s path mechanism surged and turned into ripples that rushed toward the direction where Xu Xiaoshou was flying.</p><p>“Chased, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned pale with fright.</p><p>As expected, the Night Guardian was indeed holding back.</p><p>When he saw that he had broken through space and had an opportunity to escape, he immediately could not hold back and chase after him.</p><p>This escape technique had completely entered the Way of the Heavens, and Xu Xiaoshou did not even know how to defend against it.</p><p>Even if he used the Three Days Frozen Calamity to freeze the Way of the Heavens’ energy movement again.</p><p>Just now, he had used the ice-breaking move…</p><p>The Night Guardian would still be able to tear it apart just like that?</p><p>“Chased, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Chased, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The information bar transmitted one message after another.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his scalp go numb, but he still maintained his original speed and pushed forward into the distance.</p><p>When ripples created from the Way of the Heavens’ energy movement of the Night Guardian’s incarnation approached him inch by inch and was only a few feet behind him.</p><p>He suddenly turned around and stepped out in the opposite direction towards the Night Guardian’s head.</p><p>“Ascending to the Heavens in A Single Step!”</p><p>“Weng!”</p><p>The space trembled.</p><p>The pounce that the Night Guardian’s incarnation had made from the Divine Escape Technique was completely missed.</p><p>He somersaulted in the air and came to a stop. He suddenly looked back, his eyes filled with shock.</p><p>“Teleportation?”</p><p>“Darn it, just how many tricks does this kid have up his sleeves?”</p><p>Looking at Xu Xiaoshou, who was a few miles away from him, the Night Guardian went crazy.</p><p>Since when could a sword wielder and a body player comprehend the space attribute and directly learn the space type divine skill — teleportation?</p><p>This was ridiculous!</p><p>“Thump thump…”</p><p>“Thump thump…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suppressed his racing heart.</p><p>With just one pounce from the Night Guardian, he felt even more nervous than facing ten Zhang Taiying.</p><p>The difference in strength was no joke.</p><p>Even if he hadn’t fallen into the net yet, he was completely sure that if he was caught by the Night Guardian.</p><p>Not to mention that he had a Master Physique, even a Sovereign Physique would kneel down on the spot.</p><p>“Cutting Path!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou dared to say that he had never had such a strong desire for cultivation strength like this in his entire life.</p><p>Similarly, he was actually able to escape from a Cutting Path’s attack.</p><p>It could be said that the practicality of Ascending to the Heavens in A Single Step technique was also fully displayed at this moment.</p><p>After probing his energy reserve, Xu Xiaoshou’s heart calmed down slightly.</p><p>His cultivation level had broken through to the peak.</p><p>At this moment, he had used up less than one-seventh of his spiritual source from using a teleportation technique.</p><p>As both parties were in a deadlock, High Spirits began to work with all their might.</p><p>“Freeze the heart.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s palm that contained the frozen power covered his chest. He barely managed to stop the little heart that was about to jump out of his throat. Only then did he look coldly in the direction of the grey mist figure.</p><p>“Why are you in a daze, you useless thing!”</p><p>“What are you waiting for?”</p><p>He wished that he could use his eyes to kill the grey mist figure who did not forget to scam him even at the final moment.</p><p>This fellow was too hateful.</p><p>He had broken through the spatial barrier, so why didn’t it immediately make a move?</p><p>“Yo-ho, teleportation?”</p><p>The grey mist figure was similarly shocked.</p><p>He glanced at Xu Xiaoshou, and in his heart, he was extremely envious of this kid’s various abilities.</p><p>“What a pity…”</p><p>“If you, Kid, had an additional seal attribute, I would have completely abandoned this silly girl and switched to another ghost beast host body.”</p><p>Sighing in its heart, the grey mist figure no longer hesitated.</p><p>Since Xu Xiaoshou had proven his strength, then it was time for it to display its divine might.</p><p>It formed a seal with both hands.</p><p>“Black Death Mark!”</p><p>The grey mist figure gave an order.</p><p>The Black Death Mark that had been planted from the beginning and seeped into the White Cave world from the ancient book space was finally activated.</p><p>“Hah –”</p><p>The falling momentum of the hail in the void immediately stopped.</p><p>As the air currents shot out, the black spots on each piece of hail exploded with a majestic Sealing Power.</p><p>It was different from the grey mist on the body of the grey mist figure.</p><p>The air currents that emerged from the Black Death Mark were all pure black.</p><p>Almost at the instant, the dense aura of death appeared, all traces of the path mechanisms in this world were wiped away.</p><p>“Chi”</p><p>The elements disintegrated, and the hail melted.</p><p>The low temperature in the sky was directly sealed, turning into the normal temperature of the White Cave.</p><p>“Shua!”</p><p>The dark elements that were hidden in the darkness in the void also revealed their true forms under this seal.</p><p>Then, under the repulsion of the Black Death Mark, they were directly forced into the spatial crack that had been cut open by Aje and had yet to be completely repaired.</p><p>“Is it the Sealing Power?”</p><p>A trace of solemnity appeared in the eyes of the Night Guardian.</p><p>He looked at Xu Xiaoshou with disappointment on his face. “I could have trusted you, but in front of a Red Coat you colluded with the ghost beast and refused to be judged…”</p><p>“You’re finished!”</p><p>The Night Guardian no longer showed mercy and raised his arms.</p><p>The dark aura in his energy reserve gushed out and then expelled all the black sealing aura in the vicinity, dyeing it into the darkness that the six senses could not recognize.</p><p>“Night Curtain!”</p><p>He closed his eyes and opened them.</p><p>There was no more light in the eyes of the Night Guardian, turning into the pitch-black darkness in the deepest part of the night.</p><p>The earth was engulfed by the darkness, and the nine heavens were not seen.</p><p>In an instant, a radius of dozens of miles was about to be swallowed by the true power of darkness.</p><p>“Threatened, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Locked-on, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>The information window jumped.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s frozen heart could no longer hold it in.</p><p>He quickly retreated. He no longer believed that the grey mist figure had the means to resist this bounded domain power.</p><p>“Step up…”</p><p>“Chi!”</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>The calm grey mist figure interrupted Xu Xiaoshou’s actions with a single word.</p><p>As his hands danced, the black sealing power that filled the sky condensed in the air, turning into a cold “Death” word.</p><p>Not only that.</p><p>The dark power that engulfed half of the sky and earth, which had yet to completely cover all of it, suddenly stopped after this word was spoken.</p><p>“This?”</p><p>“Rescued, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou saw this line of information, a light flashed in his eyes, and he subconsciously swallowed the last word of Ascending to the Heavens in A Single Step.</p><p>“What is this?” The Night Guardian shivered.</p><p>He realized that even though he had rejected the black sealing power at the first possible moment, his body was still affected.</p><p>He looked at his energy reserve, and there were many black spots!</p><p>“It’s not my dark power… but the power belonging to the seal ghost beast?”</p><p>The Night Guardian was stunned. “When did this happen…”</p><p>His thoughts paused for a moment, and then he completely understood.</p><p>“That’s right!”</p><p>The grey mist figure said with a savage smile, “From the beginning, from the moment you didn’t dodge the frozen power, it meant that you had already fallen for it.”</p><p>“My Black Death Mark can parasitize other powers.”</p><p>“The incessant hailstones hitting the ground and smashing down on your body meant that you had long been invaded by my sealing power.”</p><p>“When to release and when to seal you. It’s just a matter of a thought!”</p><p>The grey mist figure laughed loudly and raised both of his hands abruptly.</p><p>“Seal it for me!”</p><p>He roared angrily.</p><p>The dark bounded domain that should have closed up directly exploded and turned into black elemental light spots that disappeared.</p><p>As for the Night Guardian himself.</p><p>After the same sound, the dark power that was surging all over his body collapsed.</p><p>Even his energy reserve was suppressed by the black spot, and he couldn’t mobilize his spiritual source for a moment.</p><p>“I made a mistake…”</p><p>The Night Guardian fell from the sky.</p><p>This sealing power had even blocked his Perception of the Way of the Heavens, and he had lost his basic ability to maintain flight.</p><p>“As expected, I can’t hold back in front of this guy.”</p><p>The Night Guardian’s brows were tightly locked.</p><p>He had not expected that this seal ghost beast’s trump card would actually start brewing in the ancient book’s space.</p><p>This fellow was indeed as cunning and shrewd as ever, never letting himself fall into a desperate situation.</p><p>Even if the Night Guardian did not hold back against Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He reckoned that after Xu Xiaoshou was taken down, this grey mist figure would definitely use this skill and take the opportunity to escape.</p><p>And he, who had completely ignored the hail and black spots…</p><p>From the beginning, the outcome was determined!</p><p>“Since normal methods can’t deal with the two of you…”</p><p>“Grand Vital Energy!”</p><p>The Night Guardian’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Just as his body was about to land on the ground, he suddenly blew up the white mist in his mind.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The layers of black spots on his energy reserve, under this power, exploded like an evil demon encountering a completely restrained righteous path, burning to ashes with sizzling sounds.</p><p>“The Power of the Higher Void?”</p><p>The grey mist figure turned pale with fright. “How is this possible?”</p><p>It could not believe that this Cutting Path that had not even passed the Nine Death Thunder Calamity would actually possess the Power of the Higher Void!</p><p>Moreover, it was the Grand Vital Energy that could completely suppress its current level of power!</p><p>“Seal.”</p><p>Gritting its teeth, the grey mist figure did not dare to relax.</p><p>It directly sealed the large-scale “Death” word that had been successfully condensed in the air into the body of the Night Guardian.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The figure of the Red Coat Night Guardian was sent flying backward.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that the grey mist figure had the upper hand.</p><p>He did not expect that after completing this move, the grey mist figure would directly soar into the air as if the ground was burning its feet.</p><p>“Stinky brat, run quickly.”</p><p>“That’s the Power of the Higher Void. My current ability can’t hold it for too long. In a short while, this guy will be able to unseal it.”</p><p>“At that time, everyone will really die together!”</p><p>“The Power of the Higher Void?” Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>He knew about this thing.</p><p>Aje also had it.</p><p>However, he wouldn’t know if Aje’s unpredictable khaki-colored Power of the Higher Void would drop the ball at a critical moment. How could it resist the ability of the Night Guardian?</p><p>Even if he could, he would not be stupid enough to use Aje to fight against the people of the Holy Divine Palace!</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>He did not dare to think too much. He immediately chose a direction and was about to run away.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>The Night Guardian’s shout came at the right time. “If you dare to run away today, the next time we meet, it won’t be me.”</p><p>He prostrated on the ground as if he could not even catch his breath.</p><p>However, the Grand Vital Energy was rapidly destroying the Black Death Mark’s energy, so he did not panic at all.</p><p>“Threatened, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stopped in his tracks.</p><p>Indeed, he did not want to fall out with the Night Guardian.</p><p>But since things had developed to this point, there was nothing more to say.</p><p>“I’m sorry, the path I have chosen is different.”</p><p>“The path is different, we don’t conspire together.”</p><p>When Ascending to the Heavens in A Single Step was used, Xu Xiaoshou disappeared into the horizon.</p><p>“The path is different…”</p><p>The Night Guardian clutched his chest as he lay on the ground, muttering in a daze.</p><p>He could feel the true “justice” from Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Perhaps it was just as this kid said, he was using another way to explore this world by himself.</p><p>Or perhaps it was just as he had said, that his so-called collusion with the ghost beast was indeed his wrong judgment.</p><p>From the depths of his heart, the Night Guardian was willing to believe this.</p><p>After all, he had dealt with this kid a series of times and completely understood his way of thinking.</p><p>Even if he had many deductions, the Night Guardian was willing to trust his intuition at this moment.</p><p>However…</p><p>“But why?”</p><p>“A fearless resistance will allow you to escape for a while. What about the ending?”</p><p>He thought of the Eighth Sword Deity.</p><p>The final outcome of the continent’s number one person was also destroyed by Hua Changdeng.</p><p>A ghost beast was a ghost beast.</p><p>Any large family or faction, even the Higher Void Families, who were involved with them, would end up implicating the entire family in the end.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, what right do you have to be able to transcend?</p><p>The Night Guardian closed his eyes and did not think any further. He tried his best to refine the Black Death Mark.</p><p>…</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>“Darn it!”</p><p>The grey mist figure was furious when he saw Xu Xiaoshou running away faster than a rabbit.</p><p>This fellow’s ability to escape was even stronger than all his abilities combined.</p><p>“I can’t delay.”</p><p>Knowing that its current strength could not withstand the Night Guardian, the grey mist figure did not give up on Mo Mo, who was a rather good ghost beast host body and unsealed all of its powers.</p><p>The only choice it had now was to “escape”!</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Choosing a path that was opposite to Xu Xiaoshou’s, the grey mist figure turned into a stream of light and broke through the sound barrier.</p><p>“Ka Ka –”</p><p>Just as it passed through the inconspicuous ice sculpture on the ground that belonged solely to the man in the red dress, a soft sound appeared.</p><p>Then, the ice sculpture exploded.</p><p>The Storyteller whose lips had turned purple from the cold staggered from within.</p><p>“Hehehe…”</p><p>He seemed to be laughing, but more than that, it was probably because he was frozen.</p><p>“Old Man!”</p><p>After cursing in a bad mood, the Storyteller tilted his head and looked in the direction of the Night Guardian. “Should I say that you’re strong, or are you really stupid?”</p><p>“Your combat strength is so strong, but your brain isn’t bright, and you’re even sealed?”</p><p>“I’ve been waiting for this Black Death Mark to end, and it took such a long time…”</p><p>As he spoke, he suddenly raised his orchid-like fingers, covered his chest like a sickly and delicate person, and suddenly vomited.</p><p>“Urgh!”</p><p>The next second.</p><p>His lips and teeth split open, and a brand new Storyteller filled with mucus was spat out.</p><p>The newly appeared Storyteller seemed to be several times weaker than the previous Storyteller, but this second incarnation… had spiritual sources!</p><p>The Storyteller raised his head suddenly, and his eyes looked crazy. He looked at the grey mist figure flying above him as if he had seen his beloved toy.</p><p>“Trying to leave?”</p><p>“Have you asked!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
