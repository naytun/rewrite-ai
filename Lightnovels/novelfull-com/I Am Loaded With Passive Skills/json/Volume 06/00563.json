Instead, I took advantage of this period of time to attract everyone’s attention and secretly dug a small hole in the ancient book’s space…”</p><p>“From there, I was connected to the outside world?”</p><p>It had to be said that at this moment, Xu Xiaoshou really wanted to clap his hands and cheer for Red-robed.</p><p>This unexpected turn of events was something that he hadn’t even thought of.</p><p>And now that the situation was like this, he could actually see it very clearly.</p><p>With the Storyteller around, it was definitely impossible to forcefully break through the ancient book’s space.</p><p>Because if Red-robed moved, the Storyteller would definitely forcefully suppress her.</p><p>But under the accumulation of so many things earlier, Red-robed actually did not forget to secretly dig a small hole?</p><p>A thousand-mile-long dike was destroyed by an ant’s nest.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly understood why Yu Zhiwen shouted “Run” at his face.</p><p>Not only was she disturbing Lan Ling’s thoughts earlier, more importantly, she wanted to tell him.</p><p>Red-robed had a plan?</p><p>“Once the ancient book’s space is destroyed and the White Cave is returned, the ‘Thirty-Six Heavens Sealed Array’ will really return to Lan Ling’s hands, and it’s the kind that even the Storyteller can’t interfere with.”</p><p>“At that time, Lan Ling’s strength will definitely soar.”</p><p>“And most importantly, as long as she returns to the White Cave, with Red-robed’s methods, she will definitely be able to communicate with the outside world.”</p><p>“And in the Eighth Palace, Gou Wuyue is eyeing us like a tiger watching its prey!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts were like sparks and lightning as he immediately understood everything.</p><p>“Run?”</p><p>He thought of Yu Zhiwen’s final shout.</p><p>But..</p><p>It was impossible to run. It was impossible to run for the rest of his life.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that he had no way out.</p><p>Even if Yu Zhiwen shouted this word, whether or not he could return to the White Cave would determine whether or not he had a chance to escape.</p><p>Therefore, not only would Xu Xiaoshou not stop her, but he would also help her.</p><p>He would also help Red-robed blow up the ancient book’s space!</p><p>“Seventh brother!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils suddenly constricted, and he met the Storyteller’s gaze with a face full of surprise.</p><p>“Can’t do it?”</p><p>The Storyteller suddenly understood something.</p><p>The spiritual source in Xu Xiaoshou’s hand burst forth, and he continuously poured it into the Cardinal Wheel, causing it to start buzzing.</p><p>It’s not that I can’t fix it!</p><p>That small hole in the Heaven Sealing Array is too small!</p><p>I, Xu Xiaoshou, can easily fix this kind of thing.</p><p>Relying on the Cardinal Wheel is as simple as putting a piece of mud on it.</p><p>But..</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“These guys have communicated with the ‘Thirty-Six Heavens Sealed Array’ in the White Cave. They have been making preparations all along, and without your spatial power in the White Cave, no one can control it.”</p><p>“Once Red-robed goes out, she can contact Gou Wuyue. No one can make up for it!”</p><p>“So…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou spoke very quickly and directly told him the details through telepathic communication.</p><p>The Storyteller stared at the trembling Cardinal Wheel in his hand and hesitated. “Even you can’t control it…”</p><p>“So what exactly are you doing? !”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou instantly flew into a rage. He changed the topic and directly interrupted, “In your space, Red-robed secretly dug a hole. Did you not notice at all?”</p><p>“Your mission here is to watch the show?”</p><p>“AH? !”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was so angry that his neck was red.</p><p>The Storyteller almost spat out a mouthful of blood when he heard that.</p><p>Ever since you took out the Cardinal Wheel, who would still pay attention to that Heaven Sealing Array?</p><p>Moreover, even if they paid attention to it, the great array could not be broken. He was just a storyteller. What could he see?</p><p>Not to mention, your series of flashy actions had affected so much that no one paid attention to the space anymore.</p><p>Taking ten thousand steps back.</p><p>The space of the ancient book was shattering at any time and place. If there was an extra small opening secretly, who would be able to detect it!</p><p>Do you think that I, the Storyteller, am the omnipotent Holy Emperor?</p><p>“Second Brother, you’re right to reprimand me. It’s my fault…”</p><p>Cursing in his heart, the Storyteller lowered his head in the next second, feeling wronged.</p><p>“Instant.”</p><p>On the other side, Lan Ling had already used the power of the Heaven Sealing Array once again. Light enveloped the Red-robed and the others, and they were teleported randomly at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>“Good guy.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded.</p><p>He also felt that the gap in the Heaven Sealing Array was too small. The energy that the Red-robed had secretly stored earlier did not have the time to detonate the great array in an instant.</p><p>However, he had not expected that Lan Ling would actually do such a thing in order to prevent the Storyteller from sneak attack on Red-robed.</p><p>It was very comical.</p><p>However, he had to admit that it was very practical!</p><p>“Stop right there.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to be in control of the great array with all his heart. In reality, he was using the Cardinal Wheel to light up the path patterns of the great array once again.</p><p>In terms of explosions, he reckoned that no one present was more experienced than him.</p><p>The seven or eight layers of nested structure of sea of flowers in the City Lord Mansion of Tiansang city was already very unstable. Xu Xiaoshou could detonate it on the spot with just one setup.</p><p>The nested structure of the Heaven Sealing Array here was several layers more than that of the sea of flowers and spiritual array.</p><p>The stability of the array would definitely be dozens of times more than that of the sea of flowers if it was normally tightly clenched.</p><p>But now..</p><p>It was detonated.</p><p>But it was just one of the key points that was broken.</p><p>Red-robed didn’t dare to detonate it directly because she was afraid that the ancient book would explode on the spot and many of her own people would die.</p><p>They had some considerations, but Xu Xiaoshou..</p><p>Didn’t!</p><p>“A bunch of fools. They’ve already done it to this extent, and they still dare to hold back. Do they really think that the Storyteller is a vegetarian?”</p><p>“If they’re suppressed again, how are they going to get out?”</p><p>“They’ll be locked up in someone else’s space for hundreds of years!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cursed in his heart. With the help of the Cardinal Wheel, he used his weaving expertise to connect the dots for the path mechanism.</p><p>The formation of the spiritual array pattern did not need to be filtered by the brain at all. It directly messed up the path mechanism of the Heaven Sealing Array in front of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>The next second.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>A loud boom directly shook the defenseless Xu Xiaoshou until he fell back repeatedly.</p><p>The storyteller was dumbfounded.</p><p>“Second Brother, this…”</p><p>“Don’t move. Leave this place to me. I don’t believe that I can’t defeat these Red-robed with the Cardinal Wheel!” Xu Xiaoshou said</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have gone mad. He directly stopped the storyteller who was trying to move.</p><p>Spiritual source once again crazily poured into the Cardinal Wheel.</p><p>“Bang! Bang! Bang!”</p><p>The air that had exploded in all directions was like dark thunder that had been touched by a finger. It directly blasted the Storyteller who was far away until his ears were ringing.</p><p>However, looking at the crazy look on Second Brother’s face, the Storyteller felt that he had tried his best.</p><p>Although he felt that there was something wrong with this effort.</p><p>But he couldn’t say what was wrong with it..</p><p>“Second Brother, what on earth are you doing?”</p><p>Just as he was filled with doubt, he saw Second Brother’s face filled with ecstasy as he shouted.</p><p>“Freeze!”</p><p>With a whoosh, the group of Red-robed who were teleporting in all directions seemed to have been pressed on a switch and stopped at a random spot.</p><p>They looked at each other.</p><p>They were all dumbfounded.</p><p>Lan Ling’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Red-robed’s forehead was covered in sweat.</p><p>The Storyteller’s face was filled with ecstasy. “Second Brother, did it stop?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth twitched awkwardly. He flipped the Cardinal Wheel in his hand and put it away. Then, he held the straw hat and raised his head.</p><p>“Seventh Brother, to tell you the truth, I haven’t studied the way of spirit array for very long…”</p><p>The Storyteller did not have time to think about the hidden meaning of this sentence.</p><p>Lan Ling also had not figured out who was helping her in white cave.</p><p>Suddenly.</p><p>The space in front of Xu Xiaoshou exploded, and silver snakes danced.</p><p>As if the firing line had been ignited, the silver light followed the densely packed divine path pattern net and instantly attached to the entire Heaven Sealing Array.</p><p>In the next second.</p><p>Silver replaced Crimson.</p><p>The world suddenly lit up.</p><p>The dazzling light swallowed everything!</p><p>Then, the sound of wind, cries, and chaos..</p><p>Disappeared in unison.</p><p>Another breath later.</p><p>“Rumble! ! !”</p><p>The world collapsed and the great path collapsed.</p><p>The huge net that covered the entire Lijian Grassland was like a giant nuclear bomb that wrapped everyone in the space of the ancient book.</p><p>It directly detonated and ignited!</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>The surging explosion aura tore apart every inch of space and skin in the world.</p><p>After the piercing silver light and the explosion sound, everyone instantly felt as if they had fallen into hell.</p><p>Darkness engulfed everything in front of them.</p><p>The black hole shatterer had replaced the space of the ancient book.</p><p>The giant mushroom cloud that had not yet reached the sky had already been sucked in and eliminated by the terrifying suction force of the black hole.</p><p>The end of the world had arrived.</p><p>The world was in a miserable state!</p><p>“Second Brother, you swindler…”</p><p>The voice of the Storyteller, who had been swallowed by the black hole until his line was almost cut off, could be heard from afar.</p><p>Following that, Lan Ling had used all her strength at the final moment to shout out “Protect yourself” to all the Red-robed..</p><p>It was gone.</p><p>In this shocking explosion, no one had the time to pay attention to anything else.</p><p>Everyone could not even take care of themselves. They could only wrap their bodies with spiritual source without saying a word, trying to pass through this endless stream of black holes and find a way to survive.</p><p>“Space node!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at his surroundings and instantly lost everyone’s figures. His scalp went numb.</p><p>He knew that the explosion of the ancient book’s space actually could not kill people.</p><p>After all, there had been experiments like this before..</p><p>But the explosion couldn’t kill anyone.</p><p>The black hole could even swallow the beheading path.</p><p>The last time he could easily escape from the ancient book’s space, it was all because the entire process of the explosion was within his grasp.</p><p>He could even choose to slowly advance.</p><p>So much so that after finding the space node, he still had the mood to verify the grey mist figure’s true thoughts.</p><p>But this time, under the Storyteller’s pressure, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even consider the consequences… he directly detonated it!</p><p>Weaving expertise’s spiritual array’s path patterns were messy, and in addition, he used the condensing method of Infernal Heavens at the last moment.</p><p>Using the world as a furnace, he ignited the chaotic path patterns elixir, and forcefully blew up the furnace!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could already be considered to be able to do this sort of thing with ease.</p><p>But it was easy to explode. If he could not find the space node this time.</p><p>He, Xu Xiaoshou, could really kill himself in this explosion!</p><p>“Wu Wu…”</p><p>The black hole tore at the Red-robed. Lu Ke could not say a word.</p><p>Even his flesh and blood were fluttering under this crazy suction force.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou heard this guy’s painful whimper. He lifted his hand and brought the young man in front of him.</p><p>“If you want to live, Nod your head.”</p><p>“Wu Wu…”</p><p>Lu Ke nodded like a chicken pecking at rice.</p><p>“Okay, close your eyes. I will make sure you don’t die.” Xu Xiaoshou was halfway through his words. He felt that he could not hold on any longer, so he directly grabbed this guy and did not wait for him to make a move.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes.</p><p>“Freeze!”</p><p>Crack —</p><p>The person in his hand instantly turned into an ice sculpture.</p><p>The power of the “Three Days Frozen Calamity” could even freeze one’s soul.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the existence of the Storyteller and the fact that he was just an ordinary young man in red-robed…</p><p>How long he could last depended entirely on fate.</p><p>“Don’t worry. If I survive, I’ll definitely unfreeze this ice sculpture for you.”</p><p>With a flip of his hand, Xu Xiaoshou threw the human-shaped ice sculpture and the frozen famed sword into the Yuan mansion.</p><p>Lu Ke could not die.</p><p>Gou Wuyue was outside.</p><p>Perhaps, this youth was also a card.</p><p>“Now…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that his body was no longer under his control. He was being pulled around by the black hole. Finally, he could no longer suppress the demonic power of the Fourth Sword in his body.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Immediately, golden light bloomed in the black hole. The berserk giant had arrived.</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>With two feet stomp between the black hole, a huge ice lotus suddenly bloomed under the feet of the golden berserk giant, who had barely stabilized his body.</p><p>The Ice Lotus was grade 12, and its petals were dancing.</p><p>“Ding-ling, ding-ling…”</p><p>“Little guy.”</p><p>The berserk giant shook his head in the air, as if shaking off the dizziness in his mind. Then, he said to the ice lotus under his feet in a muffled voice, “Have you felt the ice-type element in the White Cave? Find it, that is the space node!”</p><p>“Ding-ling-ding-ling…”</p><p>..</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A beam of silver light shot out of the sword of separation, and half of the White Cave became a silver cave.</p><p>After an explosion.</p><p>The real White Cave and the green grassland above the real Lijian Grassland were directly destroyed.</p><p>With the Lijian Grassland as the center, half of the boundary of the white cave was torn apart inch by inch, and the earth was broken into pieces.</p><p>The gray destructive airflow was raging, like the scythe of the grim reaper sweeping across the human world, instantly taking the lives of countless creatures of the white cave.</p><p>Darkness.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>There were indeed a large number of white skeleton, or other creatures, who did not have high intelligence, who died directly in the explosion and died inexplicably.</p><p>However, the experiencer of the White Cave, including those who were injured in the previous battle, those who were not included in the space of the ancient book of the Storyteller, and those who had not entered the Lijian Grassland and were only training in the outer area..</p><p>They were all gone!</p><p>Yes.</p><p>They were gone.</p><p>It was not because of the explosion.</p><p>Instead, before the explosion, the huge White Cave had already returned to its original state before the White Cave’s experiential learning event.</p><p>If it was not for the Spirit Fusion Swamp, the supreme treasure that had already been unearthed, and the potholes left by the battle and the explosion..</p><p>All of this seemed like a dream.</p><p>Da</p><p>A raindrop suddenly appeared and fell from an unknown place onto the black hole.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, it was swept up into water chips and then turned into nothingness.</p><p>The next second.</p><p>Pitter-patter..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
