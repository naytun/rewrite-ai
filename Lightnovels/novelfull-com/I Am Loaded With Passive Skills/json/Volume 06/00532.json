Where was I?”</p><p>“Yes, the Cardinal Wheel.”</p><p>Caramel did not seem to care about the metaphor at all. She continued:</p><p>“The Cardinal Wheel and the Fourth Sword are not used to suppress White Cave in essence, but the Infernal Hell Sea”</p><p>“Under the effects of the two treasures and the various seals, the danger level of the Infernal Hell Sea was weakened layer by layer. Then, it half-disappeared</p><p>“It’s said to be half-disappeared because, in essence, it still exists. It’s just that outsiders can’t see it at all.”</p><p>“The birth of the White Cave’s small world was mostly due to the influence of the remnant power of the Infernal Hell Sea.”</p><p>“So, here, you can find many remnants of the power of the Seven Breaks.”</p><p>“Of course, those White Cave creatures can be weakened. Some things can’t be suppressed.”</p><p>“What things?” Xu Xiaoshou asked in shock.</p><p>“Some special existences…”</p><p>Caramel frowned and said, “Actually, I’m not very clear about this. I’ve only heard some hidden news.”</p><p>“It seems that every time the Seven Breaks appeared, it was actually somewhat related to the Abyss Island.”</p><p>“Abyss Island?” Xu Xiaoshou was startled. “What is this?”</p><p>“I told you, I’m not too sure about this either!”</p><p>Caramel rolled her eyes.</p><p>However, looking at Xu Xiaoshou’s anxious expression, she recalled that she had already taken advantage of Xu Xiaoshou, so she tried her best to explain:</p><p>“A wonderful and happy place!”</p><p>“Legend has it that it’s an empty island that floats above the auspicious clouds in the nine heavens. There are countless supreme treasures and spirit herbs inside.”</p><p>“Even if an ordinary person entered, with the immortal spirit qi inside, he would be able to cultivate the post-liminary sage physique.”</p><p>“Of course, these are only legends. I’m not sure about the rest.” Caramel’s face was filled with yearning.</p><p>An empty island… Xu Xiaoshou frowned, unable to believe it.</p><p>An island floating in the air, how powerful would one have to be to do it?</p><p>Or could it be that the Abyss Island was actually a foreign land?</p><p>The magnetic field there was abnormal and the gravity there was reversed, so the island could float in the air?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was puzzled and asked, “If the Abyss Island is as blessed as you say, why would it be associated with something as terrifying as the Seven Breaks?”</p><p>“Also, every time the Seven Breaks appears, it has a connection with the Abyss Island. How does it connect?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had a map of the White Cave in his head.</p><p>However, he could not find anything that had a connection with the so-called ‘blessed Abyss Island’.</p><p>“There definitely isn’t any now!”</p><p>Caramel said matter-of-factly, “Xu Xiaoshou, you have to remember that the place you’re at now is called the White Cave. It’s no longer the Infernal Hell Sea.”</p><p>“En…”</p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Caramel said, “But it does seem to be related. Hehe, Hehe…”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was confused for a moment. “Tell me!”</p><p>“Do you still remember what I said just now? There are some things that will not be banned even if the ‘Infernal Hell Sea’ small world is weakened?”</p><p>“Yes.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded. “So?”</p><p>“Let me tell you this…”</p><p>Caramel’s eyes rolled. “Every time the Seven Breaks appears, the connection with the Abyss Island is the spatial crack.”</p><p>“The thing I’m talking about that will not be banned is this spatial crack.”</p><p>“If you go around the White Cave more now, you might really be lucky enough to encounter this thing.”</p><p>“According to the legends, if you can pass through this spatial crack, you can successfully reach the ‘Abyss Island’!”</p><p>As Caramel spoke, she couldn’t help but laugh when she saw Xu Xiaoshou suddenly stop in her tracks.</p><p>“However, you don’t have to hope too much.”</p><p>“How terrifying is the ‘Seven Breaks’? The remaining spatial crack are completely different from the normal spatial crack in the White Cave.”</p><p>“Even if one enters the throne, there is a high probability that one will be hanged on the spot.”</p><p>“Therefore, these legends can only be said to be legends. Without strength, if you encounter an opportunity, you will die!”</p><p>“Shocked, passive value, + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was actually lost in thought halfway through the sentence.</p><p>It was not until Caramel’s last syllable that he recovered from the shock in his heart.</p><p>“Crack?”</p><p>He asked in disbelief.</p><p>“Uh huh, what’s the problem?”</p><p>Caramel tilted her head and replied.</p><p>After obtaining the “Tiancheng Spirit Wheel”, she was in a great mood. Even if it was the hateful Xu Xiaoshou in front of her, she was still interested in answering a few more questions.</p><p>“No problem…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou mumbled, completely out of the situation.</p><p>Spatial crack..</p><p>At the end of the White Cave map, wasn’t there such a thing?</p><p>The chanting of the Great Path came from within!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was completely dumbfounded.</p><p>He wasn’t able to contact this at the first moment because he was misled by Caramel’s words.</p><p>“The blessed ‘Abyss Island’…”</p><p>Where was the blessed ‘Abyss Island’?</p><p>If the ‘Infernal Hell Sea’ was related to the ‘Abyss Island’, it would be the spatial crack on the map of the White Cave.</p><p>That so-called ‘Abyss Island’ was definitely not blissful!</p><p>After all..</p><p>“Wretched Saint!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately thought of the saint who had given him the name ‘Flame Python’ and the White Pearl in his mind.</p><p>If he had any doubts about the White Cave, that was all he had.</p><p>The saint who seemed to be wearing chains was the most pathetic almighty he had ever seen in his life.</p><p>Not only did he have to sneak around to meet him, but he seemed to have been discovered in the end.</p><p>A sword intent appeared out of thin air and struck that guy so hard that he couldn’t even hide the sound of the chains on his body.</p><p>“Wait, sword will?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was terrified by the thought and broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>Who could this sword will be?</p><p>She still remembered that when the embarrassing saint’s final image was completely destroyed, he even shouted out in panic, “Holy Divine Palace?”?</p><p>In that case, the Holy Divine Palace, the sword will, and the existence that was near the White Cave..</p><p>“Gou Wuyue!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was in turmoil.</p><p>It was all connected!</p><p>It was all connected!</p><p>The Wretched Saint had used the spatial crack left behind by the Infernal Hell Sea to communicate with himself, who was from the same branch of Infernal Hell Sea. They were not far from each other..</p><p>No!</p><p>Not far from him, he forcefully controlled the famous sword Flame Python to give it to him.</p><p>Before he could say what he wanted, it was cut off.</p><p>Now, it seemed like he wanted Xu Xiaoshou’s help… to save him?</p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Xiaoshou went crazy.</p><p>What the hell was this!</p><p>He was just an innate ant saving a half-saint?</p><p>What kind of joke was this!</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou felt a headache coming on as he accepted the hot potato, the Flame Python.</p><p>Sure enough, he shouldn’t have held that sword at that time.</p><p>With this grip, he might not be able to escape the trap set by the saint.</p><p>And, most importantly..</p><p>His secret tryst was discovered!</p><p>And it was one of the Seven Sword Immortals, Gou Wuyue!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Despair rose in Xu Xiaoshou’s heart.</p><p>He finally understood.</p><p>If the “Abyss Island” really had a real explanation…</p><p>Perhaps it was the same as the news of the Ghost Beast released by the Sacred Temple. It was not what Caramel had said at all.</p><p>“Abyss Island, a banished place where half-saints are imprisoned?”</p><p>After coming to this conclusion, Xu Xiaoshou fell to the ground like a limp shrimp.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>The calls in his ears grew louder and louder. Xu Xiaoshou snapped out of his fear. He only regained his senses when he saw Caramel’s torn clothes.</p><p>“What happened to you?” Caramel asked in shock.</p><p>“I’m fine, I’m fine…”</p><p>Caramel: “…”</p><p>“Suspected, passive value, + 1.”</p><p>“Are you sure you look fine?” She leaned over and tried to help.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stammered, unable to speak clearly. “I, no, that… I’m just a little shocked. I’m fine, I’m fine…”</p><p>“Shocked?” Caramel looked at the pale young man and asked, “Xu Xiaoshou, what are you shocked about?”</p><p>What did this guy think of this time?</p><p>Caramel tried hard to recall.</p><p>But she couldn’t remember what particularly shocking secret she had revealed.</p><p>She had said everything she could.</p><p>As for the things she shouldn’t have said, she indicated that she hadn’t revealed a single word.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, what happened?</p><p>“It’s a little… big…” Xu Xiaoshou swallowed his saliva.</p><p>“Big?”</p><p>Caramel raised her eyebrows. “What big?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou extended a trembling finger and pointed at the lady’s chest. “Her clothes… are torn.”</p><p>Caramel lowered her head and her face instantly turned red.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>She swept her whip leg over, but it hit Aje’s right arm, which blocked it. Immediately, she staggered and was bounced back.</p><p>“Mama…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, receive!”</p><p>“Received call, passive value, + 1.”</p><p>“I’m here, I’m here.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou received closed her eyes and tried hard to digest her speculations and images. Only then did she open her eyes completely.</p><p>Her thoughts returned to normal.</p><p>Her calm state of mind suppressed all of these secrets.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou received the news.</p><p>If the series of conjectures he had just made were to be revealed, the world would probably be shocked to death.</p><p>Of course, the first one to die would probably be him.</p><p>“I understand, I completely understand.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what do you understand?” Caramel recovered from her embarrassment and anger. She didn’t care and asked while puffing out her chest.</p><p>He was very interested in Xu Xiaoshou’s loss of composure just now.</p><p>This guy’s personality wasn’t like that.</p><p>If he didn’t think of anything particularly horrifying, he would never completely expose his emotions to outsiders.</p><p>Therefore, he must have discovered something just now!</p><p>“Say, Xu Xiaoshou, what exactly do you understand?”</p><p>“You are pretending!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou just glared at her and said seriously and seriously, “Caramel, you are so shy… you are not a woman at all!”</p><p>Caramel: ? ? ?</p><p>She was speechless in an instant..</p><p>So the reason why you lost your composure just now was because you found out about this?</p><p>“I’ll tear you apart!”</p><p>She roared and pounced on Xu Xiaoshou. She could no longer hold back the violent emotions in her heart.</p><p>This Xu Xiaoshou… was sick!</p><p>“Aje, protect me.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a “Ascending to the Heavens in A Single Step” and directly stepped into Ice’s eyes.</p><p>“Ember, beat her up. This crazy woman… No, the crazy girl, she just needs to be taught a lesson.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“Ice, freeze her. First, freeze her mouth and fill it with ice.”</p><p>“Xu… Wu!”</p><p>“Received angry stare. Passive value, + 1.”</p><p>“Cursed. Passive value, + 1.”</p><p>“Received concerned. Passive value, + 1.”</p><p>..</p><p>Abrogated Origin Residence.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lay on the ground in a daze.</p><p>Caramel naturally left.</p><p>She couldn’t beat him, and she had finished talking. She had no other choice but to leave to find the sealed ghost beast.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was left alone in Abrogated Origin Residence, dejected..</p><p>Looking at the “Path Pattern Initial Stone” in the air, which was surrounded by a nested Divine Array and couldn’t release too much power, Xu Xiaoshou felt as if she could see herself.</p><p>Dense fog!</p><p>As expected, he had been tricked again after coming to the white hole.</p><p>Elder Sang was just the beginning.</p><p>This damn old ghost didn’t say anything about the goal of the mission. As expected, he must have been framed even more miserably.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was very suspicious now.</p><p>It was actually Elder Sang’s responsibility to accept the so-called mission of accepting the famous sword and then going to rescue the wretched saint.</p><p>After all, they were both from the Tiansang Spirit Palace..</p><p>However, Elder Sang had coincidentally taken in a disciple in the Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>It just so happened that this disciple had matured too quickly and was completely qualified to inherit his mission and enter the White Cave to bear all of this for him.</p><p>It was even more perfect that he couldn’t resist his greed at that moment..</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hugged his head and rolled on the ground.</p><p>A famous sword!</p><p>That was a famous sword!</p><p>As an ancient sword cultivator who came out of nowhere, how could he not take a famous sword when he encountered one?</p><p>Therefore, the consequences of all this resulted in..</p><p>“I really went crazy!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou roared.</p><p>He originally thought that Fourth Sword would be a disaster.</p><p>Now, it seemed that the purpose of his existence was to be a disaster!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what’s wrong?”</p><p>Mu Zixi bent down and walked over worriedly.</p><p>“I’m fine. It’s just that I’m a little irritable. You know, men have a few days every month, so their moods are very bad.”</p><p>Mu Zixi:”…”</p><p>“Cursed, passive value, + 1.”</p><p>“Then, how did your conversation with the woman outside go?” He silently cursed and continued to ask without leaving a trace.</p><p>“First of all, she’s not a woman!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou perked up and solemnly raised a finger.</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s small face immediately became nervous. “Xu Xiaoshou, how do you know that she’s not a woman?”</p><p>“UH…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression turned awkward. “It’s a long story. I’ll make it short!”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Mu Zixi replied with a doubtful expression.</p><p>“If you want to make it short, you might as well not say it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knocked on this girl’s head and said, “Besides, what can a brat like you know? You won’t know even if I tell you.”</p><p>Mu Zixi:”…”</p><p>“Cursed, passive value, + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what exactly happened between you and her?” Mu Zixi stood up angrily and looked down at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt the empty field of vision on his face and sighed softly. “I didn’t see anything, and she didn’t show it to me on purpose…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“Received call, passive value, + 1.”</p><p>“Shh.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly raised a finger and hissed, “Listen, what did you hear?”</p><p>“What?” Mu Zixi was stunned. “Nothing…”</p><p>“That’s right! Because there was nothing in the first place.”</p><p>Mu Zixi: ? ? ?</p><p>“Cursed, passive value, + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>After being teased by this cute little junior, Xu Xiaoshou finally felt better.</p><p>“Look.”</p><p>He jumped up and faced the air.</p><p>“Look your head!”</p><p>How could Mu Zixi fall for it again?</p><p>She jumped up and threw a huge wooden mallet at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“I said watch!”</p><p>After Xu Xiaoshou teleported around, she hugged the girl’s head and turned her head away from the sky. That was the position of the “Path Pattern Initial Stone”.</p><p>“Will the Divine Array be broken?”</p><p>“If this thing is broken, our house will at least double in size!”</p><p>“Ugh!” Mu Zixi froze on the spot.</p><p>Our… house?</p><p>Her face instantly turned red.</p><p>“Hated, passive value, + 1.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
