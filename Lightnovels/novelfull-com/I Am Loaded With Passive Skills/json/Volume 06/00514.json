His hands were hammering on the ground.</p><p>Mu Zixi couldn’t help but laugh as well. She covered her mouth and laughed softly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was the only one who couldn’t laugh at all.</p><p>As Yu Zhiwen told this story, why did it feel like everything was related to him?</p><p>The Eighth Sword Deity, the Sword Bearer of the Burial Sword Tomb, You Yuan Buddha, and Kui Leihan who suppressed everyone…</p><p>So, unknowingly, he had already known so many amazing seniors?</p><p>Fortunately, he had not offended all of them.</p><p>Otherwise, the days that followed would be a little difficult to bear.</p><p>He temporarily let go of these emotions. For a time, the stressed Xu Xiaoshou found it hard to listen to any stories.</p><p>He had a premonition.</p><p>If he continued to develop like this…</p><p>He might not only have to go against Red Coat.</p><p>He might even have to face the Holy Divine Palace or these legendary big shots one by one.</p><p>“It’s so hard to resist…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had a headache.</p><p>Looking at the Little Monk who was rolling on the ground with a smile, he didn’t have the mood to continue teasing him.</p><p>He directly picked him up.</p><p>“Do you want to go out?” Xu Xiaoshou asked immediately.</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Before he could react, Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand and summoned the teleportation light door, throwing the little guy back to the White Cave.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you.”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s smile froze.</p><p>“Since I don’t plan to oppress this kid, I can’t let him stay in the Yuan Mansion for too long.”</p><p>“My place is very precious.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled and pointed at the Spirit Mark of Life in the air.</p><p>With this thing, even if the rules of his Yuan Mansion were not complete, it was undoubtedly a precious place.</p><p>He ignored the reactions of the people in front of him.</p><p>“The pressure is a little too much. I’ll go and think about how to become stronger. You guys can do whatever you want.”</p><p>As he spoke, Xu Xiaoshou bid farewell to the two women. He found the collapsed tower of the Hidden Scriptures Pavilion from the Zhang Residence and entered it.</p><p>An empty and quiet environment could always calm people down a little.</p><p>“Become stronger…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered silently.</p><p>Although he had already escaped the pursuit of the Night Guardian.</p><p>But based on the current situation, once he returned to the White Cave, he reckoned that what he would face again would really be the words of the Night Guardian.</p><p>“It won’t only be the Red Coat anymore?”</p><p>It was very obvious that Xu Xiaoshou could feel the indulgence of the Night Guardian towards him. It could even be said that he doted on him.</p><p>If it was any other Red Coat, under such circumstances, they would probably not have let him explain anything and would have directly captured him and brought him back to the Red Coat base for trial.</p><p>But that Night Guardian…</p><p>“Perhaps he was also a person with dreams when he was young!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but laugh.</p><p>Sometimes, when one was old, they might not be able to control themselves.</p><p>However, he was still young and his blood was still warm. How could he allow others to dictate his fate and judge him?</p><p>“Become stronger!”</p><p>His voice became solemn.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that only by becoming stronger could he break all the shackles.</p><p>Then, how could he become stronger?</p><p>Improving his cultivation level was definitely the most important thing.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was already sprinting like a rocket after he had Stealth.</p><p>But it was not enough!</p><p>In the end, there was still not enough time.</p><p>After all, he had always been lacking in time.</p><p>Even if the Three Days Frozen Calamity had raised his cultivation level to the peak, it was still not enough.</p><p>But there was nothing he could do.</p><p>If he grew too fast, he would have to face too many people and things that should only be faced by others in ten to twenty years.</p><p>Such troubles would definitely appear.</p><p>“It’s a pity that the Infernal Original Seed didn’t have a breakthrough in cultivation level, but it’s still alright. The quality of the spiritual source has been compressed, so it’s not bad.”</p><p>“It’s just that…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was troubled.</p><p>A breakthrough in his cultivation level didn’t just mean that his strength would increase like others.</p><p>More importantly, it could raise the upper limit of the passive skill!</p><p>However, without reaching Master Stage, it was unlikely that he would be able to obtain a Sovereign Stage passive skill.</p><p>In that case…</p><p>“Lucky Draw, Awakening!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou composed himself and focused his attention on the red interface that he had not seen for a long time.</p><p>I remember the last time I upgraded my skill, it was in Tiansang City.</p><p>This White Cave has come a long way, even though he had decided it was time to finish counting the spoils.</p><p>But now, not likely!</p><p>The enemy is too strong, they must fill up!</p><p>His eyes darted to the bottom of the information bar:</p><p>“Passive Points: 315,568.”</p><p>1</p><p>Three hundred thousand!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>He had broken the record!</p><p>Although he had been prepared for this, when he saw this string of numbers led by “3,” he felt that his strength would be able to reach a climax again.</p><p>“Awesome…”</p><p>The total amount of damage he had received during this time should be very little.</p><p>Therefore, most of the increase in his passive points should not have been from the battle.</p><p>At most, he would have been trapped in the ancient book space by the red-dressed man. After receiving the Infernal Original Seed, he would have been able to accumulate some damage for a few hours.</p><p>The main source should have come from the emotional contributions of others.</p><p>“The exquisite stones at the entrance of the Eighth Palace town are for sale…”</p><p>“The teleportation portal is for sensationalism…”</p><p>“The birth of the Flame Python…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou guessed that the real main source should be the contribution of the group of people at the entrance of the teleportation portal.</p><p>After all, there was a sea of people there.</p><p>Moreover, all of them were spiritual cultivators.</p><p>In that place, the contribution of a single passive point could sometimes break through several thousand.</p><p>Even if the duration was a little short, it shouldn’t be a big problem to get a few hundred to two hundred thousand passive points.</p><p>“Tsk tsk, it’s good to have more people…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed and put down all of his thoughts. He began to rub his hands fervently.</p><p>“So, how do I use three hundred thousand?”</p><p>“Um, first of all, I should focus on upgrading my skills!”</p><p>He placed his attention on the interface.</p><p>The layout of the interface was neat, and most of the passive skills were already at the Master Stage.</p><p>Fundamental Passive Skill:</p><p>Breathing Technique (Master LV. 1)</p><p>Eternal Vitality (Master LV. 1)</p><p>High Spirits (Master LV. 1)</p><p>These three skills were the most basic skills necessary for survival.</p><p>Under Xu Xiaoshou’s high attention, it couldn’t be any more full.</p><p>Crossing the long line in the middle, his gaze landed below.</p><p>Expertise Passive Skill:</p><p>Sword Technique Expertise (Master LV. 1)</p><p>Cooking Expert (Master LV. 1)</p><p>Weaving Expertise (Master LV. 1)</p><p>These were three ultimate skills that could save one’s life at critical moments. There were still too many things that had yet to be developed.</p><p>However, the inspiration for these developments basically came from battles every time.</p><p>Hmm… and conducting alchemy!</p><p>It was a waste of time just to sit and think.</p><p>Anyway, he was a freestyle player.</p><p>He was proficient in passive skills, and it would be fine as long as his level was full. The rest would be left to improvise!</p><p>“Then…”</p><p>His gaze fell on the big piece in the middle, and Xu Xiaoshou clenched his fists.</p><p>Extended Passive Skills:</p><p>Strengthen (Master LV. 1) — Berserk Giant</p><p>Recoil (Master LV. 1) — Exploding Posture</p><p>Agility (Master LV. 1) — Ascending to the Heavens in A Single Step</p><p>Perception (Master LV. 1)</p><p>Sharpness (Innate LV. 1)</p><p>Toughness (Innate LV. 1)</p><p>Stealth (Innate LV. 1)</p><p>“There are still three skills at the Innate Stage…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered.</p><p>If he were to upgrade all of them, three would be 150,000!</p><p>He only had 300,000, how could he squander it like that?</p><p>“These passive points are too little…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that the passive points were insufficient.</p><p>He began to consider carefully.</p><p>Sharpness, there was no need to consider it.</p><p>Perhaps, when this skill reached Master Stage, it would undergo a qualitative transformation.</p><p>But no matter how much it transformed, he, Xu Xiaoshou, could see the end.</p><p>No matter how strong it was, it couldn’t be stronger than the Flame Python!</p><p>Perhaps, when his cultivation broke through to Master Stage, he would be able to push it to the Sovereign. Only then would he be able to make his entire body as sharp as a sword?</p><p>“There’s no rush. I’ll give it a try then.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought happily. His gaze went past the word ‘Sharpness’ and landed on ‘Toughness’.</p><p>This was also a skill that could be seen at the top.</p><p>Perhaps when he reached the level of a Sovereign, he would be able to combine it with the reaction force and shatter the world like the white-bearded uncle. It shouldn’t be a big problem.</p><p>But if he was only at the Master Stage…</p><p>“Let’s not consider it for now.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s attention was completely focused on ‘Stealth’.</p><p>Without a doubt, this was a divine skill!</p><p>Ever since he had it, he didn’t have to worry about his cultivation level advancing too quickly, resulting in him being captured and dissected for research.</p><p>His cultivation level didn’t have to be concealed. He could use the Breathing Technique to openly level up.</p><p>This feeling was simply too great!</p><p>Even someone as strong as the Night Guardian would probably be confused after seeing his cultivation level?</p><p>“This should be one of the few passive skills that allow one to communicate with the Way of the Heavens at the Innate Stage and possess the ability to confuse a Cutting Path, right?”</p><p>“If he were to level up to the Master Stage, perhaps… Even Higher Void would be stunned!”</p><p>“Furthermore, at the Master Stage, there will be a chance to evolve.”</p><p>“What will it become?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered.</p><p>At this moment, he didn’t think that the highest level of Stealth was concealment.</p><p>Stealth was powerful.</p><p>However, after witnessing the true power of space, if it was just a physical body that couldn’t be seen, and someone else shattered space, he would still die.</p><p>As a passive skill of the system, “Stealth” couldn’t only have such a weak function.</p><p>“Perhaps, after becoming a Master, it can completely eliminate my energy movement fluctuations, and those who want to kill me would be unable to find me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was pleasantly surprised by this sudden thought.</p><p>If that was the case, then it would be too great.</p><p>It was a situation that suited his current body!</p><p>Waving his hand, Xu Xiaoshou no longer thought about it and directly spent 50,000 passive points.</p><p>“Stealth (Innate LV. 1)”</p><p>“Stealth (Master LV. 1)”</p><p>Level 1: Master.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately felt as if he had merged with the Way of the Heavens.</p><p>No.</p><p>It didn’t seem like an illusion…</p><p>It was a “feeling”!</p><p>He felt as if even if he was in this small Yuan Mansion space, in this collapsed tower of the Hidden Scriptures Pavilion, he wouldn’t be able to discover himself at all.</p><p>It was like an inconspicuous grain of sand on the ground or the most ordinary leaf in the dense canopy of a tree.</p><p>No matter how seriously he tried to find it, it would be very easy for him to be filtered out.</p><p>“This is too strong, isn’t it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>He used his spiritual senses to look at himself, but under the influence of his subjective consciousness, he still ended up like this.</p><p>If someone else came…</p><p>“I’m afraid that even if I were to stand at the entrance of someone else’s bathroom and peek at the shower, no one would notice, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was ecstatic.</p><p>Naturally, he was not ecstatic about being able to peek.</p><p>Of course, that was also a little part of it…</p><p>But it was not important!</p><p>More importantly, if he did not use his Perception, his Perception would not be able to lock onto himself at all.</p><p>This meant that his energy movement wouldn’t be able to lock onto him at all…</p><p>It would lose its effectiveness!</p><p>As long as he disappeared from the enemy’s sight, the other party might not even be able to find him even if he took out an investigative spiritual weapon!</p><p>“Isn’t this too awesome?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly probed his energy reserve once more.</p><p>It was as if his energy reserve was covered by the Way of the Heavens’ energy movement. At this moment, his spiritual senses couldn’t detect anything at all. He was just like an ordinary person…</p><p>“This!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly had an idea. Instead of extending his Perception outward, he retracted it inward.</p><p>Through a small experiment, he discovered a new function.</p><p>The skill, Perception, was indeed able to see inward.</p><p>Furthermore, through inward vision, he could see the bones, blood, veins, spiritual source, and other parts of his body clearly!</p><p>“It’s a little disgusting.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou withdrew from this state.</p><p>Given how bloody the area was, it was likely that a physician would be able to perform some impressive maneuvers after obtaining this ability.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t used to such a scene.</p><p>“Stealth at the Master Stage…”</p><p>“It’s very powerful!”</p><p>“Even though it’s not invisibility, it’s a different kind of concealment when used in conjunction with Ascending to the Heavens in A Single Step.”</p><p>“If I were to disappear in an instant, I might even be able to erase my energy movement…”</p><p>“If I were to lie to them before the battle starts and find an opportunity to sneak away, I’m afraid that no one would be able to find out where I went even under the watchful eyes of others, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou slapped his thigh in excitement. Suddenly, he thought of something.</p><p>“That’s right. There’s also spatial fluctuation…”</p><p>He hesitated for a moment, but he quickly came to a realization.</p><p>The space type was too difficult.</p><p>If he were to rely on spatial fluctuation to find someone, it was impossible to say if the other party had such a powerful comprehension of the Way of Space.</p><p>Even if he did have it.</p><p>As long as he could shatter a few more dimensions and confuse the enemy’s line of sight, wouldn’t the enemy have no target?</p><p>“Hehe, Night Guardian…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed slyly. “This farewell is forever!”</p><p>“Hahaha –”</p><p>He laughed loudly with his hands on his waist.</p><p>It wasn’t until the message bar appeared “Suspected” that he realized that there was an outsider here. He immediately restrained his emotions.</p><p>1</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>“Steady, steady.”</p><p>He glanced at the bottom of the message bar.</p><p>“Passive value: 265,571.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded in satisfaction.</p><p>260,000.</p><p>If he were to estimate 100,000 for a passive skill that he had awakened, he still had 150,000 to use.</p><p>Then, which would be better to awaken?</p><p>“Perception, Sharpness, Toughness, Stealth…”</p><p>Xu Xiaobei focused his attention on “Perception” and “Stealth”.</p><p>Without a doubt, these two were too practical.</p><p>It was hard to decide.</p><p>“Perception is enough for now. If I awaken it again, I don’t know what direction it will take.”</p><p>“But Stealth might really be able to erase any traces of myself in this world…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated.</p><p>Stealth was too great!</p><p>At first, he didn’t pay much attention to this passive skill, but as more and more important figures paid attention to him, such as that wretched saint.</p><p>If he could completely disappear from this world…</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Bah!”</p><p>“How can I curse myself?”</p><p>He hurriedly slapped his face twice but suddenly froze.</p><p>“Wait, isn’t this system unable to produce passive points by itself?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had found a bug, the kind that could ruthlessly rip off billions of sheep’s hair.</p><p>The curse once again floated through his mind:</p><p>“If I could completely disappear from this world…”</p><p>He glanced at the information bar.</p><p>“No reaction?”</p><p>The silence made Xu Xiaoshou feel dazed.</p><p>“What’s going on? It comes and goes. Could it be that an unconscious curse can do it, but a conscious one can’t?”</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly came to a realization.</p><p>“That detestable Junior Sister…”</p><p>“I’m so angry!”</p><p>He clenched his fists and almost rushed out to hang his Junior Sister and beat her up.</p><p>This was really…</p><p>Ridiculous!</p><p>Cursing for no reason?</p><p>He was happy for nothing!</p><p>Without thinking further, Xu Xiaoshou once again focused his attention on the lottery draw.</p><p>Although it was unrealistic, awakening was indeed something that had to be done after the lottery draw.</p><p>What if the lottery draw could produce two goods at once?</p><p>And they were all passive skills that could surpass the level of “Stealth”?</p><p>“Hehe.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled.</p><p>He was always so conceited. Although he always returned empty-handed, this did not hinder the nature of human delusions, right?</p><p>“Let’s test the waters with a ten consecutive draw first!”</p><p>He waved his hand.</p><p>Anyway, there are 260,000 passive points, 50,000 in large numbers, but a drop in the bucket.</p><p>“European Emperor Possessed!”</p><p>Breaking a shout, inserted the passive key, Xu Xiaoshou piously came to a western-style amen, this will be the line of sight on the information bar.</p><p>“Thank you for your patronage!”</p><p>“Thank you for your patronage!”</p><p>“Thank you for your patronage!”</p><p>“You got one key!”</p><p>“Thank you for your patronage!”</p><p>“Thank you for your patronage!”</p><p>“Thank you for your patronage!”</p><p>“Thank you for your patronage!”</p><p>“Extended Passive Skill acquired: Transformation!”</p><p>“Thank you for your patronage!”</p><p>Transformation?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was surprised.</p><p>“Holy crap, it’s delivered!”</p><p>He widened his eyes in disbelief. He bent over, wanting to see if all of this was just an illusion.</p><p>However, the information window was in the Purple Mansion Origin Court.</p><p>Bending down would only make people fall down. How could he see it better?</p><p>1</p><p>“Dong!”</p><p>With a muffled sound, Xu Xiaoshou’s head hit the ground, creating a huge crater in the ground.</p><p>Even so, he didn’t pull his head out immediately. Instead, he continued to stare at the line of words on the information window in a daze…</p><p>“Cluck Cluck Cluck –”</p><p>His entire body began to twitch and spasm.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou went crazy.</p><p>“Transformation?”</p><p>He screamed in surprise, his voice full of surprise and joy.</p><p>Suddenly, when the loud and clear scream was about to end, Xu Xiaoshou felt that his voice could change at any time.</p><p>“Transformation?”</p><p>He called out again. This time, it was actually Mu Zixi’s voice.</p><p>“What the hell…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s voice came out as well. It was filled with a sense of horror that didn’t fit in.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held his head and his face was filled with shock.</p><p>“Voice transformation?!”</p><p>He immediately flipped over and took out a mirror. He felt that at this moment, he had the entire world.</p><p>However, no matter how much he winked, there was still no change in his expression.</p><p>“Right, right.”</p><p>“My level isn’t high enough!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately came to a realization.</p><p>5,000 passive points to Innate.</p><p>Another 50,000 passive points to the Master Stage!</p><p>“Transformation (Master LV. 1)”</p><p>“Transform!”</p><p>“Transform for me!”</p><p>With a twitch of his eyebrows, the old wrinkles on Xu Xiaoshou’s face appeared.</p><p>In the next second, he completely changed into the same face as the Night Guardian.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth was crooked from laughing.</p><p>“Hur Hur, hahaha, hahahaha!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Pinching his throat, Xu Xiaoshou’s voice became the voice of the Night Guardian. “Let’s see how you’re going to escape this time!”</p><p>Exactly the same!</p><p>“Hahaha –”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was bewitched.</p><p>He looked at the mirror and roared like a sick person, “Night Guardian, let’s see how you’re going to find me now, Haha…”</p><p>“Transformation” and “Stealth”, this was a complete set!</p><p>The face in the mirror suddenly changed into the face of the man in the Red Dress.</p><p>“Big Brother!”</p><p>A pretentious call directly made Xu Xiaoshou’s goosebumps rise to the top of his head.</p><p>Like a basin of cold water being poured on him, he instantly woke up.</p><p>“Pa!” He flipped over and stood up. Xu Xiaoshou slapped himself hard.</p><p>“Darn it, why did I make such a disgusting sound?”</p><p>“Darn…”</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but shiver again. He returned to his original appearance.</p><p>He stood still on the spot for a short while.</p><p>After a long time.</p><p>“Hahahahaha…”</p><p>After a wild laugh.</p><p>“Withdraw!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou regained his calm.</p><p>At this moment, he knew that he was invincible.</p><p>Invincible in the world!</p><p>“After leaving the White Cave, I have to change my clothes immediately.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>“One set of white robes, one set of red robes, one set of Masked Man’s, one set of Elder Sang’s, and one of that red dress. What else is there…”</p><p>“Forget it. Since I still have a few billion left, I’ll buy his clothes that are worth 100 million first!”</p><p>“What Buddha? What Monkey King…”</p><p>“Even if I don’t have any, I want all of them custom-made for me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clenched his fists tightly and his face was filled with excitement.</p><p>“Oh right…”</p><p>He suddenly thought of the system’s “Transformation”. Could it really be such a superficial change that he had thought of?</p><p>“Not necessarily.”</p><p>“No, I should say it’s definitely more than that.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou calmed down and frowned as he thought hard.</p><p>Every passive skill in the past had great use.</p><p>Although this “Transformation” was also very useful at this moment.</p><p>The skill was the word “Transformation” itself.</p><p>If the system produced something, it must be of high quality.</p><p>There must be some other “Transformation” that his current imagination had not been able to develop yet.</p><p>“Foreign object?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up as he casually grabbed a piece of gravel from the ground.</p><p>But under his control, there was no reaction at all.</p><p>“As expected, passive skills can only be used on one’s own body.”</p><p>“If other things can also be changed, then it’s an active skill.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t discouraged.</p><p>“My own body…”</p><p>He muttered to himself as he looked at the hand holding the stone. Suddenly, he had a thought.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>His arm instantly grew longer, directly piercing through the doors and windows several meters away from the collapsed tower.</p><p>“Clack, Clack, Clack…”</p><p>Broken pieces of wood fell to the ground. The scene was deathly silent.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s entire body froze.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>“This!”</p><p>In just an instant, the expression on his face changed to over a hundred different expressions.</p><p>“Darn it, this makes so much sense!”</p><p>“Transformation… it’s not a disguise, but it can completely change every part of the body!”</p><p>“This short hand of mine can change into other forms.”</p><p>“But other people’s hands also have different lengths!”</p><p>“Then, if I want to change into a longer and thicker hand of others…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned by his thoughts, and his eyes were filled with ecstasy.</p><p>He suddenly pulled his right arm back, and a scar appeared under his left eye.</p><p>In the next second, a low shout rang out from the collapsed tower.</p><p>“Third gear!”</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>What followed was a gigantic arm that had expanded to the point of breaking through the ceiling of the first floor of the collapsed tower.</p><p>That right arm that was as tall and sturdy as a god’s hammer, with a fingernail cover, was comparable to a normal human body.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>He only had a flash of inspiration in his mind, but he did not expect…</p><p>“This is truly invincible!”</p><p>He did not dare to hammer down.</p><p>Xu Xiaohe knew his strength.</p><p>He slowly withdrew his hand and stared at his thick and long arm in a daze.</p><p>“This should be the limit of the current size change.”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>After a pause, Xu Xiaoshou still muttered in disbelief, “Can I really change anything?”</p><p>The air became quiet again.</p><p>The atmosphere became strange.</p><p>Time seemed to slow down as well…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lowered his head slowly. After experiencing it for himself, he slowly raised his head.</p><p>1</p><p>His face turned red.</p><p>“Hehe…”</p><p>“Hehe…”</p><p>“This, this is really…. invincible!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
