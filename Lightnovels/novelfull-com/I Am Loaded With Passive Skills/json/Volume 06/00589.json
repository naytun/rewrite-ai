Suddenly, the corners of their mouths twitched, and they felt uncomfortable all over.</p><p>The situation had clearly reached such an exciting point that they should have drawn their swords at each other.</p><p>But listening to this “Heehee” demonic laughter..</p><p>At first, everyone didn’t think it was that ear-piercing.</p><p>But now, they were filled with the desire to ridicule.</p><p>“What’s going on with the spiritual array?”</p><p>“He did it?”</p><p>“This guy is a spirit array master?”</p><p>“But it can’t be that serious! How could our spirit array caster team be pried open so quickly? He’s not just a spirit array master?”</p><p>“No, it’s mainly because of his laughter…”</p><p>“Crap, don’t! I’ve said it, I can’t hold on any longer. You guys carry him first, I’ll go behind and laugh.”</p><p>“Look, look, Elder Wuyue can’t hold it in any longer. Look at the corner of his mouth…”</p><p>“Crap! Elder Wuyue is looking over!”</p><p>“Dodge! Dodge!”</p><p>The surrounding white-clothed people seemed to be eating melons.</p><p>When they saw Gou Wuyue’s cold gaze, they were immediately frightened into silence.</p><p>However, the aura from each of them was also brought up along with the discussion and ridicule.</p><p>Although this joy of moving into a new home kept saying “I’m not here to fight,” this laughter that was full of ridicule made people want to fight!</p><p>“Calm down, calm down.” Qiao Qianzhi bent his body and lowered his posture.</p><p>Other people couldn’t put down their face, but as the Chief Elder of the Spiritual Affairs division, he was the best at this.</p><p>“Elder Wuyue…”</p><p>“Ye Xiaotian!”</p><p>Gou Wuyue didn’t want to put this matter down easily. After glancing at Qiao Qianzhi, he interrupted him again and looked at the white-haired Dao child.</p><p>“Be soft.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi was helpless. Obviously, he couldn’t interrupt.</p><p>He hooked his finger and was about to pull Ye Xiaotian’s hand, but it went straight through.</p><p>“If you want to kill me, you can try.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was not afraid at all. Hearing this, Zhao Xidong’s crotch felt a little chilly.</p><p>This..</p><p>This was different from what they had agreed on!</p><p>Didn’t they say that they would only come here to ask for people and not fight?</p><p>There were so many excuses, and they even asked me to ignore the information, and they even gave me the first impression..</p><p>This was too deep!</p><p>He was going to do it!</p><p>Zhao Xidong’s body trembled, and he wanted to say something.</p><p>Xiao Qixiu’s steps slanted, and he stood in front of him, not saying a word.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>Zhao Xidong’s eyes directly stared at him.</p><p>Now was not the time to be polite with boss Xiao.</p><p>If things went wrong, my wife would probably become a widow!</p><p>“Watch and learn. When the sky falls, someone will hold it up,” Xiao Qixiu said telepathic communication calmly.</p><p>Zhao Xidong fell silent.</p><p>He glanced at the Dean’s stature..</p><p>Hold it up with him?</p><p>Are you serious?</p><p>..</p><p>The arena was filled with anxious scenes of a duel.</p><p>However, even though Gou Wuyue had drawn his sword, Ye Xiaotian was not afraid at all.</p><p>Even though Ye Xiaotian had spoken arrogantly, and even white-clothed and the others felt that it was intolerable, Gou Wuyue still held his sword.</p><p>He didn’t even have the slightest intention of slashing out.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>After resting for more than ten breaths, when everyone was drenched in cold sweat, Gou Wuyue shouted loudly and sheathed his sword.</p><p>“That’s it?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian raised his right eyebrow. His provocative words almost caused Zhao Xidong to die on the spot.</p><p>“Ye Xiaotian, I didn’t expect that after such a long time, you would still be like this. I understand what you mean.” A smile appeared on Gou Wuyue’s face once again. “Perhaps this is the reason why you and I don’t share the same beliefs.”</p><p>“It has nothing to do with this.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian floated backward and glanced at the terrified onlookers outside. Then, he looked at the person in front of him and said,</p><p>“Cutting Path, I want to rely on myself, not external forces.”</p><p>“As for you, Gou Wuyue, you just chose to submit in the end.”</p><p>“Different paths, not because of your temperament, but because of your ambition.”</p><p>“My heart is facing the sea. Although I live in a remote corner, I can still see the entire continent.”</p><p>“You claim that white-clothed people are above the clouds, but at this moment, you don’t even dare to draw your sword.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>The corners of Gou Wuyue’s mouth twitched, and he almost couldn’t even squeeze out a smile.</p><p>Everyone outside was also stunned by what they heard.</p><p>They had no idea how this white-haired Dao child had become the Dean of Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>Other people had already reached this step, but he didn’t know how to walk down it?</p><p>“You didn’t come here to mock me, did you?” Gou Wuyue’s face was expressionless.</p><p>He had no intention of explaining.</p><p>There were too many things in the world, and the bystanders had their own opinions.</p><p>If everyone wanted to get the expectations in his heart, then wouldn’t the person involved have to spend a great deal of effort to argue and explain?</p><p>The matter was man-made, not something that could be determined by public opinion.</p><p>Gou Wuyue knew that Ye Xiaotian definitely had a misunderstanding about him, but he did not intend to say it.</p><p>There was nothing else. He did not have the energy.</p><p>Everything should be left to time to judge.</p><p>The arena paused for a moment before Ye Xiaotian slowly shook his head.</p><p>“Of course not.”</p><p>“But here, I just want to say a few more words.”</p><p>“I don’t think you just want to say a few more words, right?” Gou Wuyue sneered.</p><p>“Naturally.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian didn’t say anything else. Instead, he swept his gaze across the voice of Lan, a famed sword slave, before landing on the ground and raising his head.</p><p>“I came here just to pick someone up.”</p><p>His tone was extremely friendly.</p><p>For the first time, an extremely gentle smile appeared on the white-haired Dao child’s face.</p><p>However, that smile that made people feel as if they were bathed in a spring breeze almost made the eyes of the onlookers pop out of their sockets.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>That guy who was so aggressive just now… he turned hostile faster than flipping through a book. He must be talking about this kind of thing!</p><p>Zhao Xidong was also dumbfounded.</p><p>He turned his head to look at boss Xiao with uncertainty and pointed at him. “Learn, learn this?”</p><p>“Dong!”</p><p>Xiao Qixiu directly hit him on the back of the head, causing him so much pain that he almost squatted down with his hands covering his head.</p><p>“Damn, if I didn’t learn this, what would I learn? The principal of the academy? I have to be as tall as him!” Zhao Xidong cursed in his heart.</p><p>However, there were some words that he clearly couldn’t say out loud.</p><p>He looked at the arena once again.</p><p>The atmosphere seemed to have become less subtle as the two big shots relaxed at the same time.</p><p>Although it was indeed still very subtle, the current subtlety was no longer as subtle as before.</p><p>There was a kind of..</p><p>“To rise, first suppress?”</p><p>“Or to rise, first suppress?”</p><p>Zhao Xidong shook off the water in his head. He realized that his knowledge reserves were clearly unable to give a definite assessment.</p><p>He could only feel one… feeling, that indescribable feeling!</p><p>“Have you figured it out?” Xiao Qixiu sent telepathic communication over.</p><p>Zhao Xidong nodded and shook his head again.</p><p>“Stupid!” Xiao Qixiu cursed in a low voice and didn’t say anything else.</p><p>A group of old geezers, playing some kind of riddle… Zhao Xidong cursed in his heart and also focused on looking over, no longer distracted.</p><p>After ye Xiaotian finished speaking, Gou Wuyue clearly understood something and revealed a slightly enlightened look. He wanted to suppress it, but he couldn’t. He revealed an expression of helplessness after being seen by others.</p><p>“Pick someone up?” His tone was somewhat mocking.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian, on the other hand, seemed to be burning with anger. “Yes, pick someone up!”</p><p>“Pick who up?” Gou Wuyue asked.</p><p>“Don’t you know who to pick up?”</p><p>“If you don’t tell me, how would I know?”</p><p>“If you know, why should I tell you?”</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was so angry that his white hair fluttered in the wind. he shouted angrily, “Tiansang Spirit Palace!”</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>“The people of Tiansang Spirit Palace!”</p><p>“What’s wrong with them?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The scene was dead silent.</p><p>Everyone felt their hearts clench again. Cold sweat, which had just been dried by the wind, broke out again.</p><p>It turned out that the opposite was going to happen again, right?</p><p>In the past, they had never seen these people play around like this.</p><p>Today, they all looked like children?</p><p>Ye Xiaotian restrained his anger and calmed his tone. “Gou Wuyue, I know that you and I are not on good terms, but today, I came not only for old scores, but also for new people.”</p><p>“OH.” Gou Wuyue’s face was expressionless.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian clenched his teeth and then said with relief, “Since they have already come out of the White Cave, why do you still want to lock them up and not release them directly?”</p><p>Hearing that, the white-clothed people were stunned, and they looked like they were sitting upright.</p><p>“Come out?”</p><p>Gou Wuyue smiled. “When did you see them come out?”</p><p>“Now! Now!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian pointed at the white-clothed people outside. “Isn’t their reaction obvious enough?”</p><p>“Heh.”</p><p>Gou Wuyue smiled indifferently and said, “Since when can ‘reaction’ be used as evidence in court? If there’s no evidence, I don’t like to say it, and I don’t like to hear it from others either.”</p><p>“This is ‘Tang’?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian pointed at the ground and glanced sideways at the tent that had been split by the sword will. “The cover has been chopped off by you, and if there was a plaque, it would have been cut off long ago. Tell me, ‘Tang’?”</p><p>“Yes, indeed. Hall has rules. If it’s not hall, then there are no rules.”</p><p>Gou Wuyue spread out his hands. “But now there are no rules. Are you talking about reactions with me?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s forehead twitched. He sighed and forced himself to calm down.</p><p>“Gou Wuyue, a straightforward person doesn’t beat around the bush. Did you bring him out?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Alright, what if I did?”</p><p>“If you did, you can take him away.”</p><p>“Sure, you can say it!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian flew up into the sky and glanced at one spot. “There’s only one space in this world that I can’t sense. Do you dare to bring me there to see it?”</p><p>Gou Wuyue also flew up into the sky.</p><p>“It’s not that I don’t dare, but I really can’t.”</p><p>“You know, white-clothed has his own rules when it comes to handling matters. You’ve already broken the rules by coming here for no reason.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian laughed out loud. “Old… Gou Wuyue! You said yourself that there are no rules!”</p><p>Instantly, there were people below who felt that the battle situation was about to escalate.</p><p>This roar was so loud that it almost caused them to shed all pretense of cordiality, right? !</p><p>Gou Wuyue was also greatly angered by this “Old what”, but he was still an elderly person, so he could remain calm. “There are no rules, but that doesn’t mean that the white-clothed here don’t have rules either!”</p><p>“This is the rule you spoke of? !”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian let out an angry roar, and his entire figure instantly disappeared.</p><p>Gou Wuyue was momentarily shocked. He clearly did not expect Ye Xiaotian to dare to be so impudent, and he immediately rushed over.</p><p>However, how could spatial teleportation be compared to ordinary speed?</p><p>Gou Wuyue barely moved, and he felt that the surrounding space had completely squeezed out of him.</p><p>His body only paused for a moment.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian had already stabbed his hand into the sky from above that space, directly breaking off a whole piece and smashing it down viciously.</p><p>Rumble..</p><p>Everyone’s hearts suddenly constricted.</p><p>This move, the “Hand of Ripping Heaven” that broke the sky with his bare hands, was really too shocking.</p><p>The sky leaked out of the sky, and the black hole shattered.</p><p>Something seemed to be about to be exposed in that unknown space.</p><p>“Take a look at what this is!” Ye Xiaotian turned his head and pointed behind him, glaring angrily at Gou Wuyue.</p><p>A dazzling light suddenly pierced through from behind him, almost blinding everyone’s eyes.</p><p>“What is it?” Gou Wuyue’s lips curled. He was no longer in a hurry and crossed his arms as he looked over.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian secretly felt that things were not looking good and immediately turned around.</p><p>In his line of sight, the experiencer of the White Cave, who was supposed to be exposed under everyone’s eyes and was hidden deep within the spatial confinement, was actually replaced by a dazzling ball of light that was as bright as the sun.</p><p>Under the isolation of this ball of light, it was impossible to see what was going on inside.</p><p>“Good fellow!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was so angry that he was amused. He glanced at the person beside Zhao Xidong and shook his head. “Since when did white-clothed’s methods become so dirty? Is this the team led by you, Gou Wuyue?”</p><p>White clothed was immediately provoked.</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>“Shut up, you little dwarf!”</p><p>“What nonsense are you saying! Not only did you break the rules first, you even dare to criticize others?”</p><p>The scene instantly became noisy.</p><p>Gou Wuyue narrowed his eyes and swept his gaze across, only then did everyone obediently shut up.</p><p>“Damn, siding with outsiders!” There was actually someone who dared to ridicule.</p><p>“Shut up, are you courting death? One look and you can tell that this Shorty has a great relationship with Elder Wuyue. It might even be that kind of relationship. Don’t you know how to ridicule him in your heart?”</p><p>“I’m telepathic communication!”</p><p>“DAMN, then why did you send it to me? !”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Gou Wuyue turned his head around and asked with a smile, “Ye Xiaotian, what exactly do you want to show me?”</p><p>“Ha!”</p><p>“Do you really think that just the light attribute can block out all the truth?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian snorted. His hands slid through the air, and the space suddenly became crystal clear.</p><p>Then, in the Void, a group of people in groups of two or three appeared in the darkness, clustered together.</p><p>Everyone with discerning eyes knew that scene very clearly. It was the scene that had been replaced by the light just now.</p><p>At this moment, it was captured by the spatial backtrack.</p><p>White-clothed, who was at the bottom, retracted his head somewhat paradoxically, not daring to say anything more.</p><p>However, Gou Wuyue did not take it to heart at all.</p><p>“Is this what you wanted to show me?”</p><p>“The scene in that space?”</p><p>“I’m sorry…”</p><p>He shrugged. “You have strange space attributes. Forgive me for not agreeing with what these subjective consciousnesses are displaying.”</p><p>“Hu ~”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was really angry.</p><p>After taking a deep breath, he took a deep breath and opened his eyes wide, as if he was going to roar.</p><p>At this critical moment, Qiao Qianzhi suddenly appeared in front of him.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>He snapped his knuckles on Ye Xiaotian’s head. The latter was so angry that he didn’t have time to react. He was knocked three times on the head and lost his breath.</p><p>Turning around, Ye Xiaotian glared at him.</p><p>“Heehee Heehee…”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi pressed his head down and said apologetically to Gou Wuyue, “Elder Wuyue, since it’s a misunderstanding, we won’t bother you anymore. Goodbye.”</p><p>“What are you playing at… Oh.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi covered Ye Xiaotian’s mouth and dragged him to the ground.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
