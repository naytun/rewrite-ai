In front of the Storyteller Senior, he couldn’t even make a splash and was directly suppressed.</p><p>..</p><p>“AI ~”</p><p>The storyteller was extremely comfortable with this shout.</p><p>He enjoyed it for a long time before saying, “Then, Brother Wen Ming, since you really want to know, I will tell you.”</p><p>“Avatar…”</p><p>The Storyteller exhaled a breath of hot air and his voice was full of temptation, “Do you want to learn?”</p><p>“I don’t want to! ! !”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost lost his soul on the spot. Even his ears were red. He didn’t know what the reason was.</p><p>However, could he really say “I don’t want to”?</p><p>“Don’t you want to learn?”</p><p>Looking at the hesitant Xu Xiaoshou, the Storyteller’s face suddenly turned stiff. He said heavily, “This is an avatar that only a demi-saint can master. He thinks highly of you, so he wants to teach you!”</p><p>“I want to…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was about to cry. He said helplessly, “Human… Ah Pei! I really want to learn…”</p><p>Luo Leilei almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>What did I just hear?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was almost homogenized?</p><p>“Yes, yes, that’s more like it!”</p><p>The Storyteller finally let go of Xu Xiaoshou’s shoulder. He turned around and walked over to Xu Xiaoshou with light steps.</p><p>“I know that you actually want to learn, but there’s a prerequisite for me to teach you…”</p><p>“What prerequisite?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“You have to go with me.”</p><p>The Storyteller stretched out his slender fingers and pointed at Xu Xiaoshou’s chest. His red lips opened slightly. “I know that Big Brother likes you very much, but now, I also like you very much.”</p><p>“So, if you want to learn, you have to promise to go with me in the end. As for after that… you can’t be taken away by Big Brother, understand?”</p><p>Looking at the red-dressed man in front of him, he was about to get close to him.</p><p>Feeling the binding force, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even have the ability to take a step back.</p><p>He could only try his best to lean back his soul and ask with difficulty, “Big Brother, who? The Eighth Sword Deity?”</p><p>The Storyteller’s action of getting close to him suddenly froze, and his eyes became a little funny.</p><p>“Rascal, it’s already at this point, and you still dare to try to get information from him?”</p><p>“Do you really think that I’ve forgotten what you’ve done just now?”</p><p>“UH…” Xu Xiaoshou’s expression froze, as if he had no intention of doing so. He asked again, “What information? I’m just curious.”</p><p>“Don’t you all want to know why I can last longer than Lei Shuangxing?”</p><p>As he spoke, his gaze turned to Luo Leilei, and he said, “It’s because I met an uncle previously, and he gave me an ancient book.”</p><p>Luo Leilei’s face darkened.</p><p>Before he could speak, the Storyteller’s interest was piqued.</p><p>“What book?”</p><p>“Sword Observation Manual!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally felt a normal person’s curious gaze on the Storyteller’s face. He felt a sense of relief as he continued,</p><p>“That uncle saved my life. Seeing that I have extraordinary talent, he gave me an ancient book, the ‘Sword Observation Manual’.”</p><p>After saying this, Xu Xiaoshou pursed his lips and didn’t say anything. His gaze was still on Luo Leilei.</p><p>However, his ‘Perception’ in the dark had been observing the storyteller’s reaction.</p><p>“Sword Observation Manual…”</p><p>Doubt appeared in the Storyteller’s eyes. “The sword observation manual created by the Eighth Sword Deity?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded as a hint of surprise appeared in his heart.</p><p>Could it be that his guess was wrong?</p><p>That scruffy-looking man and the Saint Servant’s chief were not the same person?</p><p>“What does he look like?”</p><p>The Storyteller frowned. It was obvious that his brother’s matter had overshadowed all his other matters at this moment.</p><p>“Scruffy, long hair, covered in oil, and dragging a big sack…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said as he observed his reaction. Seeing that there was no response, he pondered and said, “Eight fingers, there is a big scar on his neck.”</p><p>The Storyteller’s pupils faintly trembled.</p><p>If it wasn’t for Xu Xiaoshou’s sharp perception, he wouldn’t even be able to observe this small detail.</p><p>He immediately glanced at the information bar.</p><p>“Suspected, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Watched, passive points + 1.”</p><p>Suspected?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was dazed.</p><p>What did this mean? What was the Storyteller suspecting?</p><p>Was he doubting the authenticity of his words?</p><p>Or was he doubting the identity of the scruffy-looking man?</p><p>Or was he doubting his so-called “Brother” because of his words?</p><p>“You’re lying to me!” The Storyteller suddenly said confidently.</p><p>“I won’t.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately shook his head like a rattle-drum, his gaze sincere. “I, Xu Xiaoshou, never lie to anyone!”</p><p>“Ah Pei!”</p><p>Luo Leilei, who was at the side, immediately spat and said anxiously, “Senior Storyteller, don’t believe his lies. It’s already very good if nine out of ten of this guy’s sentences are half true!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s forehead was filled with black lines.</p><p>He’s trying to trick me!</p><p>You little brat, you better not be alone and let me, Xu Xiaoshou, catch you!</p><p>Otherwise, I’ll teach you a lesson!</p><p>“Hehe…”</p><p>The eyes of the Storyteller rolled, and the interest in his eyes grew.</p><p>“Liked, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>“Liked, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou saw these messages, he felt like a muggle.</p><p>As expected, the next second, the Storyteller said, “Little brother, I’m getting more and more curious about you.”</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>He paused for a moment and thought, “I can let bygones be bygones. You don’t have to worry that I’ll kill you.”</p><p>“But, there’s only one condition!” The Storyteller raised a finger.</p><p>“Let me out first.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even ask for any conditions and immediately interjected.</p><p>The Storyteller raised his eyebrows.</p><p>“Pop”</p><p>The void rippled gently.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou instantly felt that he was once again recognized by the Way of the Heavens.</p><p>Whoosh.</p><p>He took a step forward and directly flashed a few hundred feet away.</p><p>“Don’t run, you won’t be able to escape.”</p><p>The Storyteller narrowed his eyes. “But, if you really want to play the game of eagle catching chicken, I will risk my life to accompany you!”</p><p>“Expected, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wanted to directly use the vanishing technique to become invisible and then leave this place.</p><p>However, he didn’t know the specific ability of the Storyteller.</p><p>Compared to the Night Guardian, this guy was too troublesome.</p><p>The vanishing technique could protect him for a while, but not for long.</p><p>If the other party really had that ability to lock onto him… it was only a matter of time before he was caught.</p><p>“I’m not running.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou heaved a sigh of relief. He looked around and muttered, “I just prefer to have my own personal space.”</p><p>The Storyteller’s eyes were filled with a smile.</p><p>A distance of several hundred feet was just a short distance to him.</p><p>Since his Brother Wen Ming wanted to maintain a distance, he should give him enough respect.</p><p>He shook his vertical finger.</p><p>“One condition.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a headache coming. He could only ask, “What condition…”</p><p>He shifted his gaze to Luo Leilei, “If it’s the condition you mentioned at the Tianxuan Gate, then I’m sorry. I, Xu Xiaoshou, will not accept it.”</p><p>“What did you say?”</p><p>The Storyteller turned his head to look at Luo Leilei.</p><p>Luo Leilei had a headache and replied, “It’s what Senior wants to ask.”</p><p>The Storyteller’s gaze froze.</p><p>The temperature in the world began to drop.</p><p>It wasn’t the freezing attribute.</p><p>Instead, under the cold killing intent, even the Way of the Heavens began to keep silent in fear.</p><p>“They gave you a chance, you should reconsider.” The Storyteller narrowed his eyes. “Remember, you only have one chance.”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou choked for a moment.</p><p>His rationality told him that he could not act tough anymore.</p><p>But..</p><p>He could not do it!</p><p>If he really wanted to follow the Storyteller, he might as well follow the night guardian and return to the Red-robed prison with him for a while.</p><p>God knows what terrible things would happen next to this perverted man in the Red-robed.</p><p>If he lost his integrity, what should he do?</p><p>But refuse..</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was in a dilemma.</p><p>He really hoped that something unexpected would happen at this time, such as a meteorite falling from the sky and being smashed to death by the Storyteller.</p><p>How could someone be like this?</p><p>How could someone be so terrifying?</p><p>What kind of freaks and oddities did this “Saint Servant” recruit!</p><p>“Your brother said that he wouldn’t take me away by force. He respects me very much.” With a flash of inspiration, Xu Xiaoshou added a few more words.</p><p>But the Storyteller was unmoved.</p><p>“Brother is brother, he is me.”</p><p>“Now, it’s none of his business. He has taken a fancy to you.”</p><p>Tilting his head, the storyteller smiled and said, “What do you think?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was silent.</p><p>It was impossible to leave with the Storyteller!</p><p>But not with..</p><p>A fight?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s hand touched his chest. Even when facing the night guardian, he did not take out the ring treasure.</p><p>But now, he seriously suspected that even if Aje came out, could he defeat the Storyteller in front of him?</p><p>This guy was not the Night Guardian. Would he be afraid of blowing up the White Cave in a battle?</p><p>Obviously..</p><p>No!</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>Aje’s low moan came. He seemed to feel “Ma Ma’s” panic.</p><p>This was an emotion that he had never felt before.</p><p>“Don’t move.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou interjected with his spiritual senses and advised, “Don’t worry, don’t come out now. He won’t kill me.”</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>“Comforted. Passive points + 1.”</p><p>A warm current surged in his heart.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held Aje in his hand and looked at the storyteller. “May I ask, what realm are you in now?”</p><p>The interest in the Storyteller’s eyes grew.</p><p>“You want to fight with him?”</p><p>At this moment, even Luo Leilei felt her heart clench.</p><p>She thought of what Xu Xiaoshou had said in the Tianxuan Gate.</p><p>“I will see my own world, even if… I am covered in wounds?”</p><p>“Senior Storyteller!”</p><p>Luo Leilei immediately sent telepathic communication. “You must not kill him. This is the person whom the chief thinks highly of. If you kill him, then…”</p><p>The Storyteller turned around and glanced at him indifferently.</p><p>Luo Leilei’s voice suddenly stopped.</p><p>It’s over..</p><p>It’s over!</p><p>How did it turn out like this? Xu Xiaoshou was not only the person that the chief thinks highly of, he was also Senior Sleeveless’ disciple.</p><p>Senior Storyteller, you can’t! ! !</p><p>However, no matter how much she wanted to stop him, the Storyteller’s casual glance made Luo Leilei realize.</p><p>In this arena, she had no right to speak.</p><p>The cowardice and coyness on the surface was just an illusion. In reality, the Storyteller wasn’t afraid of anyone!</p><p>How could the person he fancied give up so easily?</p><p>“Received concern, passive points + 1.”</p><p>..</p><p>“I don’t want to fight, I don’t want to fight.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand and said, “I’m just curious… I’m just a little more curious.”</p><p>The Storyteller’s attitude towards the young man in front of him was many times better than Luo Leilei’s.</p><p>“Cutting Path.”</p><p>He smiled and answered, “The peak of Cutting Path.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not believe him. “Red-robed’s Night Guardian is also a Cutting Path. Why do I feel that you’re much stronger than him?”</p><p>“There’s no need to flatter him.”</p><p>The Storyteller looked refreshed and said again, “That old guy didn’t dare to go through the nine Death Thunder Calamity, but he did.”</p><p>“How many tribulations?”</p><p>“All of them.”</p><p>The Storyteller answered straightforwardly, but Xu Xiaoshou’s mind went blank.</p><p>If he really went through the nine Death Thunder calamity..</p><p>The Storyteller was only half a step away from the higher void?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>This was the person he had faced before who was the closest to the strongest realm in the world.</p><p>The wretched saint who was unreachable and could only communicate with him through a few planes was not counted.</p><p>He was also different from the Saint Servant chief who was half-crippled and on the verge of death.</p><p>The Storyteller was at his peak!</p><p>How could a mere innate expert like him be able to contend against such a person?</p><p>After weighing the pros and cons, Xu Xiaoshou still wanted to struggle for a while.</p><p>“If this brat wants to recklessly ask for advice, will Senior Storyteller be merciful and give way to me?”</p><p>Luo Leilei’s forehead broke out in cold sweat.</p><p>Do you want to die? !</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, are you crazy? !</p><p>“Blocked, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou ignored Luo Leilei’s gaze and met the Storyteller’s gaze.</p><p>The Storyteller’s eyes were filled with admiration and love.</p><p>“How do you want me to give way to you?”</p><p>“Is one move enough?”</p><p>He suddenly shook his head. “It’s too little. How about this, they’ll let you take the initiative to attack, and when you’re tired, they’ll replace you?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was instantly covered in goosebumps.</p><p>As he quietly comprehended ‘Weaving Expertise’ and communicated with the rules of this White Cave world, he wiped off his cold sweat and said,</p><p>“No, what I mean is, Senior, can you let me run first, and then after a period of time, you’ll chase after me?”</p><p>The Storyteller burst out laughing, then covered his mouth and said, “You’re so interesting.”</p><p>“Run?”</p><p>He tilted his head and thought for a while, then his expression suddenly became serious.</p><p>“If you want to run, why are you communicating with the Way of the Heavens? Are you trying to follow the method you did in the ancient book’s space and blow up the White Cave?”</p><p>He raised his hand.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou instantly felt that the rules of the heavens that he communicated with were directly blocked.</p><p>This time, even his weaving expertise seemed to have lost its effectiveness.</p><p>No matter how much he tried to enter, he would never be able to sense the rules of this world.</p><p>Exile… a word that suited his state of mind came to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>There was nothing he could do.</p><p>If he couldn’t even detonate the White Cave, how could he escape this calamity?</p><p>This is impossible..</p><p>Death!</p><p>Death without a chance of survival!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
