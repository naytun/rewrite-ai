He used his spiritual senses and shouted at the Infernal Fire Seed.</p><p>“I’m from the same lineage as you. I gave you a chance and brought you in. Yet, you’re still so arrogant. Do you really have to burn my Origin Court?”</p><p>“Now, the Three Days Frozen Calamity has completely accepted me.”</p><p>“Once I fully connect its main body into the energy reserve, its power will be at its peak. If you’re already sealed, how are you going to resist?”</p><p>“If you resist again, you best believe that I will directly seal you with the Three Days Frozen Calamity!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou threatened.</p><p>He fully understood that when dealing with this kind of tyrannical type of supreme treasure.</p><p>The other party cannot be persuaded with a soft approach.</p><p>The moment his aura weakened a little, this fire seed would probably seize the opportunity and completely devour him.</p><p>“PLOP PLOP!”</p><p>But he was very surprised.</p><p>Even if it was threatened, the Infernal Fire Seed was not to be trifled with. It burned the remaining frozen power even more savagely.</p><p>“You don’t believe it, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou snorted coldly.</p><p>At that time, he was afraid that if he channeled both of them into the energy reserve at the same time, it would cause the energy reserve to collapse. That would be the case if he was unable to control it.</p><p>But now…</p><p>The Three Days Frozen Calamity had completely accepted him. One thing was inferior to the other.</p><p>And now the possibility of his energy reserve collapsing?</p><p>Heh.</p><p>That wouldn’t happen!</p><p>“Since that’s the case…”</p><p>Completely ignoring the feelings of the Infernal Original Seed, Xu Xiaoshou placed his gaze on the Three Days Frozen Calamity.</p><p>“Are you ready?”</p><p>“Ding Ling Ding Ling…”</p><p>“Then come!”</p><p>After exhaling deeply.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou activated the Breathing Technique and sucked the ice flame in front of him.</p><p>“Hiss –”</p><p>The majestic frozen power was instantly swallowed through his throat. Then, guided by the Breathing Technique, it arrived above his energy reserve.</p><p>“Ka-ka.”</p><p>The Infernal Original Seed panicked.</p><p>At this moment, the large amount of frozen power had completely suppressed it.</p><p>Even the fire seed itself was covered in a layer of frost.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stopped his energy.</p><p>“I’ll give you one last chance. Are you continuing to resist, or do you choose to accept your ice flame companion? Think about it carefully.”</p><p>After those ruthless words, his voice became gentler.</p><p>“You have spiritual intelligence as well, and you completely understand that this wave of frozen power is only the afterglow of its power</p><p>“Now, I want to bring in the main body of the Three Days Frozen Calamity. You can slowly think about it.”</p><p>“Do you want to repent during the frozen days until you come to your senses?”</p><p>“Or do you choose to receive the Three Days Frozen Calamity after I have suppressed its power, and become friends with it…”</p><p>“I won’t force you.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind was filled with gentleness, “Because no matter which method you choose, I can borrow your power.”</p><p>“Pu Pu –”</p><p>The Infernal Fire Seed began to vibrate crazily.</p><p>Endless infernal aura was released, and the ice crystals on Xu Xiaoshou’s body were burned to ashes. Steam began to rise again.</p><p>“I understand what you mean.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not surprised at all.</p><p>The Infernal Original Seed was the most domineering thing in the world, so it was normal for it to have such a reaction.</p><p>If the other party were to become listless at this moment, Xu Xiaoshou would really look down on this fire seed.</p><p>But no matter what kind of reaction it had, he would have a way to deal with it.</p><p>“Come on, I have high hopes for you. Continue to resist!”</p><p>After giving the fire seed a round of encouragement, Xu Xiaoshou no longer bothered with the fiery temper of this fellow. Instead, he opened his mouth and sucked in the Three Days Frozen Calamity.</p><p>“Enter my body!”</p><p>With a whoosh, the Three Days Frozen Calamity turned into a stream of light and shot into Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth.</p><p>The Breathing Technique was once again activated. Following the tendons and bones, it connected the supreme treasure, the ice flame, to the upper part of the energy reserve.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The moment it entered his energy reserve.</p><p>The infernal power and the frozen power immediately clashed together. In an instant, they stirred up a myriad of waves of spiritual source, creating a deafening sound.</p><p>“Ding Ling Ding Ling…”</p><p>A puzzled thought came from the Three Days Frozen Calamity.</p><p>It was wondering that Xu Xiaoshou had clearly said that the other party had also accepted it.</p><p>But now, there seemed to be something wrong with the situation?</p><p>“It’s fine, it’s just throwing a little tantrum.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled lightly, “After all, the two of you have complete opposite powers. When you face each other, even if everyone accepts each other, you still have to put up a symbolic resistance.”</p><p>“Everyone has pride.”</p><p>“It just depends on when to put it down.”</p><p>“Ding, Ding, Ding…”</p><p>The Three Days Frozen Calamity lotus petal withdrew and completely restrained its power.</p><p>In an instant, other than where it was, the energy reserve was enveloped by the infernal aura.</p><p>“You don’t have to be polite!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw that this ice flame was so introverted and immediately ordered, “That guy is too arrogant. You can’t always be so soft, or else you’ll be bullied.”</p><p>“Let’s teach it a lesson first. Let’s talk after the ice is sealed.”</p><p>The Three Days Frozen Calamity paused.</p><p>It seemed like it couldn’t keep up with its new master’s train of thought.</p><p>But the order was given.</p><p>Even if it couldn’t figure it out, it didn’t affect its execution of the order.</p><p>“Ding, Ding, Ding…”</p><p>The lotus petal bloomed.</p><p>The frozen power completely erupted.</p><p>The infernal aura which seemed as if it wanted to swallow everything, finally met its opponent. Under the attack of the frost, it was slowly retreating.</p><p>Finally.</p><p>The frozen power directly occupied everything, forcing the Infernal Original Seed into a dead end.</p><p>“Ding-ling-ding-ling…”</p><p>The Three Days Frozen Calamity couldn’t bear it anymore.</p><p>This wasn’t its personality.</p><p>In the past, it wouldn’t take the initiative to attack and force any spiritual treasures of the same kind to such an extent.</p><p>“Don’t be afraid, seal it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gave an unsentimental order once again.</p><p>This time, the Infernal Original Seed finally panicked.</p><p>It didn’t like this icy aura.</p><p>Therefore, it couldn’t bear to be trapped in this ice-type power and stay in Xu Xiaoshou’s upper energy reserve for the rest of its life.</p><p>Since it was used to being overbearing, after feeling the unbreakable shackles on its body, it finally chose to lower its head for the first time.</p><p>“Pu Pu…”</p><p>A weak moan sounded. The Infernal Original Seed seemed to be begging for mercy.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused.</p><p>“It’s too late.”</p><p>“I gave you a chance just now. It’s useless to show weakness now!”</p><p>The voice became cold, and Xu Xiaoshou ordered again.</p><p>“Seal it!”</p><p>Since the Infernal Original Seed’s power was no longer needed to explode the outer space.</p><p>In that case, to prevent this fellow from causing any damage at the critical moment.</p><p>The most appropriate method at this time was to let the fire seed calm down and reflect on what it had done wrong.</p><p>“Ka Ka!”</p><p>There was no hesitation at all.</p><p>After getting used to Xu Xiaoshou’s rhythm, under an order, the power of the Three Days Frozen Calamity enveloped the Infernal Original Seed and completely froze it.</p><p>“Hu”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou exhaled.</p><p>This time, what he exhaled was finally not the scorching power, but a wave of frost.</p><p>And after the Three Days Frozen Calamity completely accepted him, it would no longer harm his physical body.</p><p>All the power was transferred through the Breathing Technique and then sent out.</p><p>It was like an arm and a finger!</p><p>“Very good.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought.</p><p>The layer of ice that covered his body made cracking sounds and turned into pure spiritual strength, pouring into his energy reserve from his mouth and nose.</p><p>His limbs returned to their normal state and he could move.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was filled with joy.</p><p>Suddenly, his energy reserve shook.</p><p>After the Three Days Frozen Calamity had completely taken over the dominant power, it began to take root and truly recognize its master.</p><p>“Buzz –”</p><p>An obscure sound was emitted from the ice flame’s body, and then spread to the entire energy reserve, and then to the outside of his body.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a chill run through his body.</p><p>In the next second, he could sense something.</p><p>There was an extremely intimate connection between him and the Three Days Frozen Calamity.</p><p>“Recognize its Master?”</p><p>This was the first time that a spiritual object had voluntarily recognized him as its master, and it was a new experience for Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>When the binding was over, he could feel that everything had changed.</p><p>Suddenly, there were some dense blue light spots between the elements of heaven and earth that his spiritual senses could detect.</p><p>“Ice element?”</p><p>Not only that.</p><p>Apart from the ice element that covered heaven and earth, the Three Days Frozen Calamity itself as a flame also gave him the ability of fire.</p><p>The fire element could also be seen.</p><p>However, the amount was too little.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that this didn’t mean that the fire element of the Three Days Frozen Calamity was inferior to the ice element.</p><p>It was only because of the large amount of frozen power that the elements in the world had been assimilated by the ice element.</p><p>“That’s great!”</p><p>Previously, when he had stepped into the Origin Court State.</p><p>Originally he had the opportunity to awaken the fire-type Innate Elemental Power.</p><p>But because of the devouring of that broken system, he had completely lost this opportunity.</p><p>Now, with the acceptance of the Three Days Frozen Calamity, not only had it made up for the fire-type Innate Elemental Power, but it had also brought along an additional ice-type ability?</p><p>“Strong!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was ecstatic.</p><p>However, the pleasant surprise brought by this kind of world treasure recognizing its master clearly did not stop there.</p><p>Almost at the same moment when he saw the heaven and earth elements, Xu Xiaoshou felt that the Three Days Frozen Calamity had completely stabilized in his energy reserve.</p><p>In the next second, when it felt that its master could completely absorb the ice-type ability to replenish his body.</p><p>The ice flame poured out, and endless pure ice-type spiritual strength gushed out from it.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou felt that every cell in his body was filled with this ice-type energy.</p><p>He started to expand.</p><p>He was really expanding!</p><p>“Darn, I won’t explode, right?”</p><p>“Take it easy, take it easy, don’t do anything rash!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gave the order in panic.</p><p>However, after the spiritual object took root, its energy was fed back. It was obviously not something that the Three Days Frozen Calamity could easily control.</p><p>Even though it knew that the current host’s body was too weak and might not be able to withstand its own power.</p><p>However, as it tried its best to control it, the majestic energy continued to push forward step by step.</p><p>The Three Days Frozen Calamity was too powerful!</p><p>Almost every time such a supreme treasure appeared, it would be fought over by experts above the Sovereign Stage.</p><p>How could there be a situation where an Occupied Void State Innate would obtain it?</p><p>For a moment, even Xu Xiaoshou, who had a Master Physique, cracked under the power.</p><p>The Breathing Technique sensed that something was wrong.</p><p>The appearance of this power was a great opportunity for it to contribute.</p><p>The passive skill operated on its own. In an instant, most of the energy was converted into spiritual sources and poured into his energy reserve.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>His energy reserve rose.</p><p>After the first wave of spiritual sources was gathered, Xu Xiaoshou felt that his cultivation level of the initial stage of the Occupied Void was about to be filled up.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>Another wave of spiritual sources was converted, and his cultivation level broke through, reaching the mid-stage.</p><p>The quality and quantity increased at the same time, and with the decrease in ice-type energy, the feeling of fullness on his body disappeared quite a bit.</p><p>It was obviously very cold, but Xu Xiaoshou’s face was flushed red. He gritted his teeth as if he was suppressing something.</p><p>“Weng!”</p><p>The Breathing Technique changed again.</p><p>Under this wave, more than half of the ice-type energy was assimilated.</p><p>“Ah Ah!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally couldn’t hold it in anymore, and his body began to tremble violently.</p><p>This was even stronger than taking a bunch of Origin Court Pills.</p><p>Such a majestic power was injected just like that.</p><p>And the method to inject it was a Breathing Technique of the Master Stage. Who could withstand this?</p><p>“En!”</p><p>“AH!”</p><p>“Good good good good, continue…”</p><p>With “Stealth”, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t care about the breakthrough in cultivation level.</p><p>Right now, this passive skill was only at the Innate Stage, and it was enough to make a Sovereign and Cutting Path look ambiguous.</p><p>He believed that as long as he could reach the Master Stage, he could confuse everyone.</p><p>Under such circumstances, how could Xu Xiaoshou suppress his cultivation level?</p><p>“Go, go, go!”</p><p>The energy reserve rose again and again.</p><p>Inside the Snow Mountain, a series of chants could be heard.</p><p>After a long time.</p><p>Along with a loud sound that stopped the moving clouds.</p><p>Peace was restored.</p><p>“Hu…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou heaved a heavy sigh of relief.</p><p>His entire body went limp and fell into the layer of ice.</p><p>Under the countless assault of spiritual sources, he felt that at this moment, even moving a finger was strenuous.</p><p>Weak…</p><p>Incomparably weak…</p><p>Fortunately, when everything ended, the Breathing Technique stopped, and the Eternal Vitality that was constantly working immediately noticed.</p><p>Not long after, the vitality cleared away all the negative states.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he had been reborn.</p><p>“Peak of Occupied Void!”</p><p>He checked his energy reserve, and he was in disbelief.</p><p>Because of his Master Physique, his energy reserve had always been unusually large.</p><p>Whether it was quality or quantity, it was several times stronger than the young people of the same level.</p><p>He still remembered that when he obtained the infernal energy liquid from those ordinary White Skeletons, it wasn’t even enough to allow him to breakthrough from the early stage of the Occupied Void to the mid-stage.</p><p>But now…</p><p>Just this wave of spiritual object feedback had helped Xu Xiaoshou break through the mid-stage and the late-stage in one go and reach the Peak of Occupied Void.</p><p>“How powerful!”</p><p>On the other hand, Xu Xiaoshou could imagine how terrifying the Three Days Frozen Calamity was this time.</p><p>In fact, during the highlight moment, he felt that he could almost breakthrough to the Upper Spiritual Level.</p><p>However, it came to an abrupt stop.</p><p>It seemed that it wasn’t just the Occupied Void.</p><p>His Upper Spiritual Level was also much stronger than ordinary spirit cultivators because of the abnormal appearances in his body.</p><p>The ice energy was strong.</p><p>However, it wasn’t enough for him to directly break through the door of the Upper Spiritual Level.</p><p>Even so.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was also filled with emotions.</p><p>“It’s too substantial…”</p><p>He knew that his deduction wasn’t wrong.</p><p>The Upper Spiritual Level…</p><p>If he wanted to break through to the Upper Spiritual Level, other than his comprehension of the Way of the Heavens, he wouldn’t be able to match up to a Master.</p><p>In terms of quality and quantity, his spiritual source could definitely be compared.</p><p>After all, if he were to think about it from another perspective.</p><p>For a powerful spiritual object like the Three Days Frozen Calamity, and the additional feedback after recognizing its master.</p><p>It unexpectedly managed to level up an Occupied Void who was a weak Innate, from the early-stage of cultivation level, breaking through to the peak.</p><p>If this gets out, nobody would believe it!</p><p>“Breakthrough complete.”</p><p>“Now is the time to get out!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou came back to his senses.</p><p>It was as if he could see through the snow-capped mountains into the outside world.</p><p>“Red Dress Man, how dare you trap me, Xu Xiaoshou. Just you wait!”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>“I’ll show you how I escape!”</p><p>Even if he was at the Peak of Occupied Void, or mastered the Three Days Frozen Calamity, Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t arrogant enough to think that he could deal with the red dress man.</p><p>After all, he was an existence that could even chase away the grey mist figure when it was at its peak state!</p><p>He felt the dense ice elemental light spots around him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned his head to look at the iceberg that was trapping him.</p><p>This towering behemoth was condensed from the remaining power of the Three Days Frozen Calamity.</p><p>At that time, he still felt that it was unshakable.</p><p>Even if he used the Infernal Original Seed, he probably wouldn’t be able to melt it in a short amount of time.</p><p>But now…</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>With a thought, it was as if a god was guiding it.</p><p>Just a single word, the iceberg instantly collapsed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was ecstatic.</p><p>This ability to command the elements was indeed real, and it was something that every spiritual cultivator could have.</p><p>In the past, Xu Xiaoshou did not have it.</p><p>Now, he could say it in an upright manner.</p><p>Not only was he an ice-type, he, Xu Xiaoshou, was also both ice-and fire-type spiritual cultivator!</p><p>He closed his palm, and then another.</p><p>The energy in the void gathered the three flowers gathered at the top, and the spiritual source flowed back, forming a dancing ice lotus in front of his chest.</p><p>Three Days Frozen Calamity!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held the ice flame with one hand and curled his fingers.</p><p>“Gather!”</p><p>Then.</p><p>The towering ice mountain collapsed and turned into endless elemental light spots, which were absorbed into the ice lotus.</p><p>Then, the Breathing Technique was activated, and all of them were swallowed into the energy reserve.</p><p>“Boom Boom Boom –”</p><p>The sound of space cracking in the outside world was clearly heard.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his head and looked over. In front of him was a scene of doomsday where the void had collapsed.</p><p>He did not mind it.</p><p>If this was the first time seeing such a scene, people would panic.</p><p>However, after getting used to such a sight, there was nothing to be afraid of.</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>He turned his head.</p><p>Aje flew over.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held the ice lotus and opened his arms with a smile. He wanted to give a warm hug for a reunion.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>There was an explosion.</p><p>In the next second, his body was sent flying dozens of feet away by Aje.</p><p>Even though there was a Recoil, Aje only trembled a little. His little feet stepped back and neutralized the attack.</p><p>“Ma Ma?”</p><p>Darn it!</p><p>Your Ma Ma had just obtained the Three Days Frozen Calamity and just comprehended the ability of ice and fire types. Can you not give me such a big blow right from the start?!</p><p>“Alright, alright, there’s no need for a hug. There’s no need for you to come over.” Seeing that Aje was about to rush over again, Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly tried to dissuade him.</p><p>Who could withstand Aje’s hug?</p><p>He was afraid that he would have to refine half of the Infernal Original Seed and climb up to the Sovereign Physique with his physical body. Only then would he be qualified to be intimate with this fellow.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>The grey mist figure muttered.</p><p>He looked at the ice lotus in Xu Xiaoshou’s hand with a complicated expression.</p><p>“You managed to refine the Three Days Frozen Calamity completely?” He could not help but ask in shock.</p><p>“Isn’t that obvious!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rolled his eyes and gestured for the Ice Lotus in his hand to move forward. “If I didn’t completely refine it, would I be able to summon this thing?”</p><p>He glanced at the sky. “How did you create such a ruckus?”</p><p>“But, you’re not of the ice attribute…”</p><p>“I’m of the fire attribute!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou beamed. “No matter how low the temperature of the Three Days Frozen Calamity is, it’s still fire.”</p><p>“Since it’s fire, how could I, a fire-type spiritual cultivator and an Elixir Master, not be able to control it?”</p><p>“Do you think I’m you?”</p><p>The fog around the grey mist figure twitched.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Fine!”</p><p>“I won’t talk to you anymore.”</p><p>The grey mist figure held back and looked up at the sky. He said faintly, “Since you have obtained the Three Days Frozen Calamity, that’s your luck. Now, it’s time to get down to business.”</p><p>“Business is business, but…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled and said, “Why do you care what I do?”</p><p>He’s not going to forget what this guy did to him when he absorbed the Infernal Original Seed.</p><p>Cooperation…</p><p>If this guy did not insist on wanting his Infernal Original Seed and provoked Aje.</p><p>Maybe he would not even bother with the Three Days Frozen Calamity!</p><p>And now, the insatiable grey mist figure had told him that it was his luck that he was able to obtain the ice flame”…</p><p>Who would believe that?</p><p>If this fellow did not trip him up when he broke the space and forcefully took the treasure, Xu Xiaoshou would have thought that the grey mist figure had changed his personality!</p><p>“What does it have to do with me?”</p><p>The grey mist figure was amused by anger. “I was quietly collecting the Three Days Frozen Calamity. It didn’t matter if you sent your pet to disturb me.”</p><p>“Now, the two treasures belong to you.”</p><p>“What do you think breaking the space has to do with me?”</p><p>“Hehe.” Xu Xiaoshou responded with a chuckle.</p><p>He was not convinced by anyone in the past.</p><p>However, the grey mist figure was lying with his eyes wide open and was reasoning well had opened his eyes a lot.</p><p>“Then let me ask you.”</p><p>He put away the ice lotus and said, “We talked about cooperation before. We’ll break the space together. I’ll do my part, and you’ll do yours. In the end, we’ll escape together.”</p><p>“What about now?”</p><p>“I can help now but what about you?”</p><p>“What can you do to break through the space?”</p><p>“I…” The grey mist figure was dumbfounded by the question.</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>What can I do?</p><p>What Xu Xiaoshou said didn’t seem unreasonable, right?</p><p>It didn’t have the Three Days Frozen Calamity or the Infernal Original Seed…</p><p>The only thing it could do was to watch Xu Xiaoshou destroy the place and beg the other party to take it out?</p><p>“Bah!”</p><p>The grey mist figure slapped its head and finally realized that it had been led astray.</p><p>“You’re bullshitting!”</p><p>He said angrily, “I only want to ask you when we were working together, how did we discuss the distribution of treasures?”</p><p>“One for each person, right?”</p><p>“What about now?”</p><p>“Where are the treasures now?”</p><p>“Whose fault is this? Don’t you know?”</p><p>“Do you dare to say that you, Xu Xiaoshou, didn’t have any selfishness in this cooperation? You were doing it for me?”</p><p>The more the grey mist figure spoke, the more agitated he became.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waited for him to calm down before nodding slightly.</p><p>“The space is about to explode. The outside world is starting to interfere.”</p><p>“You failed to collect the ice flame. I’ll help you collect them and then bring you out. If this isn’t for you, then who is it for?”</p><p>“Is it for myself?”</p><p>“Bah!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou spat, “I, Xu Xiaoshou, am such a person? I’m impartial!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The air suddenly became quiet.</p><p>“Surprised, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Stared At, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>The grey mist figure was completely stunned.</p><p>It felt the nameless karmic fire burning in its heart, constantly instigating it to commit crimes.</p><p>Even if it had to pay a small price, it had to completely unseal itself and ravage the brat that’s in front of it. Only then would it be able to slightly ease its crazy emotions.</p><p>The grey mist figure admitted that this time, it had to act impulsively.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was too detestable!</p><p>He had gone too far!</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>An explosion sounded in the air. As the sealing aura surged, the grey mist figure’s entire body shot out.</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>Aje had barely moved when Xu Xiaoshou had already crossed him, indicating that he would deal with this himself.</p><p>He extended his palm.</p><p>He did not even use a single bit of his spiritual source. He just stuck close to the grey mist figure’s fist and directly pushed forward.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>In the next second, the boundary was formed by the exchange of fists and palms.</p><p>The grey mist figure, including all the space behind him, directly turned into an ice crystal world with a loud explosion.</p><p>Hail that fell from the sky…</p><p>Endless cracks in the void rift…</p><p>Including the grey mist figure who came charging at him with an irresistible force…</p><p>Everything was frozen!</p><p>The scene was layered.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou slowly retracted his hand before flicking his sleeves. He raised his chin and looked at Aje, who seemed to be “worshipping” him.</p><p>He said nonchalantly, “This move… should be called ‘Ice Age’, right?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
