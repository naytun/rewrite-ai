If you get ‘Fourth Sword’, you’ll be the Ghost Beast Host?”</p><p>“This guy probably broke through to the throne in the White Cave. He hasn’t even confirmed the identity of the stowaway yet. How did you determine that he’s the Ghost Beast Host?”</p><p>“If we calculate according to this, wouldn’t we be the next ghost beast host after we obtain the ‘Fourth Sword’?”</p><p>“Oh, what are you guys talking about? A Ghost Beast Host… What is it?”</p><p>Clamorous discussions broke out one after another.</p><p>The appearance of Lan Ling’s inappropriate voice was indeed too easy for people to misunderstand.</p><p>Even though deep in their hearts, due to their trust in the red-robed man, everyone chose to stop their footsteps.</p><p>Similarly, after using their bodies to bring them in, no one was willing to be slandered.</p><p>Even though they weren’t the ones who received the ‘Fourth Sword’ at this moment, they all chose to speak out in unison.</p><p>But it was obvious.</p><p>These people who spoke lightly weren’t enough to cause the red-robed to stop.</p><p>Just as Lan Ling finished speaking, several teleportation portals suddenly flashed around the man holding the sword in the air.</p><p>In the next second, more than ten red-robed men flew out.</p><p>“Slander!”</p><p>“Red-robed… Slander!”</p><p>The square-faced man holding the fierce sword had an unconcealable look of panic on his face.</p><p>As he cursed angrily, he turned his head to look at the people who were standing still in the air.</p><p>“This is red-robed’s attitude. Did you see it?”</p><p>“If I am captured without any reason, the next person to die will be someone among you!”</p><p>“Ghost Beast Host, what a huge crime. Red-robed, you guys are really…”</p><p>Halfway through his sentence.</p><p>The man seemed to choke as his voice suddenly stopped.</p><p>In the next second, his body swelled up crazily.</p><p>“Bang! ! !”</p><p>After an explosion.</p><p>A terrifying demonic aura burst out from his body and passed through the body of the red dress who was protected by spiritual aura.</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>How did the person who was still fine just now explode just like that?</p><p>Everyone looked over and saw that the person who was still physically healthy just a moment ago was completely disintegrated after this explosion.</p><p>His four limbs were broken, his waist and back were crushed, and his entire person..</p><p>No, not even half of him was left.</p><p>Whether he had any consciousness left or not, it was still a question!</p><p>“This is also a red-robed’s method?”</p><p>In the crowd, someone cried out in fear.</p><p>“Fierce sword backlash!”</p><p>One of the red-robed men turned around and cursed angrily before waving his hand.</p><p>“Take it down!”</p><p>Shua Shua Shua.</p><p>All the red-robed men took out a white jade slip.</p><p>As the light shone on it, the man with the ‘Fourth Sword’ in his hand did not even have the chance to resist before his entire body was sealed and subsequently absorbed.</p><p>“Hiss”</p><p>The Void Man and the others were all shocked.</p><p>Such a swift method..</p><p>He did not even say two words.</p><p>A throne level battle strength was taken down just like that?</p><p>This was the true strength of the red-robed man?</p><p>“That’s not right. There needs to be an explanation for this matter!”</p><p>“Whether that fellow is a Ghost Beast or not is another matter. It is clearly child’s play for you to take him down without distinguishing between right and wrong! Child’s play!”</p><p>“Ha, an explanation?”</p><p>The letter in front of Lan Ling sneered and flew up into the sky. A piece of paper flew out from her hand.</p><p>“This, is an explanation!”</p><p>No matter how messy the piece of paper fell, the amount of time it faced the crowd was only for an instant.</p><p>However, all of the people present were Spiritual Cultivator. They all had spiritual thoughts.</p><p>With a glance, they all saw the face on the wanted poster.</p><p>One of the faces was the same as the man from before!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>In the deep pit underground.</p><p>Mu Zixi closed her eyes as if she was covering her ears to steal a bell. However, she couldn’t help but say the name of one of the familiar faces on the wanted poster.</p><p>“Master?”</p><p>She turned her head and closed her God Devil Eyes, which had consumed a lot of energy, to look at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Did you see it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed and rubbed his junior’s head. “Don’t worry, I’m not a ghost beast, but the red-robe did put a bounty on my head. That’s why I had to transform before I dared to come here.”</p><p>“I believe you.” Mu Zixi nodded her head vigorously.</p><p>“I received affirmation. Passive value, + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a warmth in his heart.</p><p>Sometimes, it wasn’t good to know a person’s true emotions too clearly.</p><p>He was really afraid that at this time, a message would suddenly appear on the message board saying that he had been deceived, then..</p><p>“It’s too real, this verification system.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoyu shook her head and didn’t think anymore.</p><p>The wanted poster that the bald man had sent out had indeed shocked him.</p><p>It was not because he had seen his own face on it.</p><p>It was because Hong Yi’s judgment was almost correct!</p><p>On those few pieces of paper, Xu Xiaoshou had seen many familiar faces.</p><p>Xin Gugu, Caramel, Mo Mo..</p><p>He was even certain that these people had never interacted with Red-robed before.</p><p>But under such circumstances, Red-robed had also completely locked onto the target of the trial.</p><p>Even though this target might still be in a state of doubt.</p><p>However, this ability to doubt was just too terrifying.</p><p>“How did he do it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little flustered.</p><p>It was fortunate that he did not sign a ghost beast contract with Greedy the Cat Spirit at this moment.</p><p>Otherwise…</p><p>With just a glance, he reckoned that he might even have the intention to turn around and retreat.</p><p>Red-robed was indeed a little terrifying!</p><p>“Master, why does Red-robed’s net seem to be retracting a little fast?” Mu Zixi turned her head and asked.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was slightly surprised.</p><p>Junior actually knew the word “Retracting”?</p><p>When Mu Zixi heard that there was no response from the other side, she immediately understood her senior’s thoughts.</p><p>“Cursed, passive value, + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clicked his tongue and said, “The net seems to be retracting a little fast, but think carefully. What you can think of now, would red dress not be able to think of?”</p><p>“HMM?” Mu Zixi did not understand what she meant.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated for a moment.</p><p>He did not really want to explain, but when he thought of his junior sister’s strange ‘God Devil Eyes’.</p><p>What if one day, this lady fell into a similar situation by herself, what should he do?</p><p>“Junior, remember this well. In this world, no one who can cultivate to the level of Red-robed is stupid.”</p><p>“Since even you think that they are closing the net fast, why do they still want to keep the Red-robed?”</p><p>“Why don’t they wait a little longer?”</p><p>“They exposed the array so quickly to let more people hiding in the dark know that they are actually surrounded. Is this really a good idea?”</p><p>“So?” Mu Zixi blinked her big eyes. “Why?”</p><p>“I don’t know either. Think about it yourself.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said, “But you just have to know that they are not stupid. They dare to do this. They must have their reasons.”</p><p>Mu Zixi:”…”</p><p>“Cursed, passive value, + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t say anything.</p><p>Did he really not know?</p><p>No.</p><p>He could vaguely guess some of it.</p><p>Perhaps this was not much for the red-robed man’s true plan.</p><p>But it was definitely not like Mu Zixi, who was completely confused and could not make heads or tails of it.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>In their ‘Perception’, after the ghost beast host that did not even have the time to resist was subdued, the group of red-robed men actually did not choose to take out ‘Fourth Sword’. Instead, they allowed it to choose another direction to leave.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The people who were suspended in midair were bewildered for a moment. They didn’t dare to directly chase after it.</p><p>“Senior red-robed, what’s going on?”</p><p>“Yeah, this ‘Fourth Sword’. Are we going to take it or not?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Lan Ling smiled and replied, “I solemnly declare that the red-robed men aren’t interested in the ‘Fourth Sword’ at all. We are only responsible for the ghost beasts and stowaways.”</p><p>“I have also said that as long as you enter the White Cave through the proper channels, ‘Fourth Sword’ is one of the treasures. That is all.”</p><p>“Whether you can get it or not depends on your abilities.”</p><p>“But if outsiders want to interfere…”</p><p>She paused for a moment and pointed at the direction where the Ghost Beast’s body was sealed. She said faintly, “This is the end!”</p><p>There was an uproar in the air.</p><p>After she said that, everyone finally chose to believe in red-robed once again.</p><p>Not only did the people who had stopped in the air immediately return to pursue the sword.</p><p>Even more than ten figures shot out from below.</p><p>The sword left, and the people chased after it!</p><p>However..</p><p>They simply could not catch up!</p><p>On the Lijian Grassland that was filled with demonic qi, the white-hot scene was torn apart.</p><p>The scene was both funny and sad.</p><p>In the underground pit.</p><p>“Is what Red-robed said true?” Mu Zixi turned around and asked with a face full of disbelief.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sneered, “Think about it with your knees. You know that it’s impossible.”</p><p>“But they said so. In front of so many people…”</p><p>“You mean they won’t go back on their words, right?” Xu Xiaoshou said, “Yes, Red-robed did say that they won’t take action, but what about White-clothed and the Holy Divine Palace?”</p><p>“Yu Zhiwen, have you seen her?”</p><p>“This girl was walking with us just now. After she left, she could already stand in front of the red-robed leader. This is enough to show her status.”</p><p>“Under such circumstances, even if red-robed wanted to take the sword, wouldn’t the final result fall into her hands?”</p><p>“Rather than that, it’s better to push the boat along with the current and give this group of White Cave experiencers a hope. At the same time, let them stir up the situation.”</p><p>“Understand?”</p><p>Mu Zixi nodded as if she didn’t understand. “I think it’s more than that.”</p><p>“Oh, why do you say that?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little surprised.</p><p>This lady could think of a deeper level?</p><p>It’s like the saying, ‘What’s near cinnabar goes red’, this is!</p><p>Mu Zixi lowered her voice and said, “I feel that once these words are said, as long as no experiencers can walk out of the White Cave, then Red-robed will not break her promise.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless for a moment.</p><p>He was a little shocked. How could his junior’s mind be filled with such crazy thoughts?</p><p>Exterminate all the survivors?</p><p>Just as he was about to retort, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly hesitated.</p><p>Wasn’t this in line with Red-robed’s usual style?</p><p>Genocide..</p><p>“It should be impossible!”</p><p>After thinking for a moment, Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and said, “No matter how much you resist Red-robed, this organization that belongs to the number one force on the continent would not do such a cruel thing.”</p><p>“OH.”</p><p>Mu Zixi nodded her head and didn’t say anything. She continued to look at the battlefield.</p><p>“Fishing for law enforcement huh…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed.</p><p>Using ‘Fourth Sword’ as bait to fish for big fish like “Saint Servant” and Ghost Beasts.</p><p>Perhaps only a super power like the Holy Divine Palace had the confidence to choose to act like this.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Continuous explosions sounded in the air.</p><p>Every time this sound appeared, it meant that the sword wielder of ‘Fourth Sword’ had a new iteration.</p><p>The last time he got this fierce sword, he couldn’t resist the backlash of the fierce sword.</p><p>Without exception, all of them exploded and died.</p><p>“So cruel…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou watched as more and more pretentious people flew toward ‘Fourth Sword’ like moths to a flame, and he couldn’t help but sigh in his heart.</p><p>People died for wealth, and birds died for food.</p><p>This was a famous saying in any world.</p><p>“What big fish will be next…”</p><p>He no longer paid attention to ‘Fourth Sword’.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that with these people and their strength, not to mention wielding ‘Fourth Sword’, just the wave of demonic qi that entered their bodies when they touched the sword was something few people could withstand.</p><p>These cannon fodders were not the big fish that red robe wanted to catch.</p><p>Then..</p><p>He turned his head to look at the huge enchantment that covered the entire Lijian Grassland.</p><p>“Just with Red-robed’s ability, can she do this?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was very doubtful.</p><p>Because he saw more than just a tiny bit of divine path pattern on this huge array.</p><p>“Lan Ling is only a spirit array master. If she wants to do this, Yu Zhiwen must have helped a lot.”</p><p>“Just as Mu Zixi said, the net was drawn too quickly. At this moment, no other big fish would be willing to jump out and die.”</p><p>“Even so, Red-robed still managed to break this barrier. What is her intention?”</p><p>His thoughts spun crazily.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou racked his brains and could only come to one conclusion:</p><p>Red-robed could see all the potential sword snatchers.</p><p>Moreover, their ultimate goal had all fallen into the sword-leaving plains.</p><p>Only then could they open the enchantment without hesitation!</p><p>“Saint Servant, Ghost Beast…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s “Perception” instantly landed in Xin Gugu’s direction.</p><p>This fellow was so calm that it did not seem like his personality.</p><p>Even though there were several times when ‘Fourth Sword’ flew past his head, he was completely indifferent.</p><p>“What is he waiting for?”</p><p>“Waiting for Caramel?”</p><p>“That’s not right.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not sense Caramel’s aura.</p><p>After that woman obtained the spirit plate, she should have gone to look for the Sacrificial Carving piece. It was possible that she was not here, but it was also possible.</p><p>However..</p><p>When he thought about how Caramel had appeared in front of him without a sound.</p><p>The greater possibility was that she had used the Tiancheng Spirit Wheel to lock onto Lan Xinzi and the man beside her.</p><p>At this moment, they were also in the sword separation prairie!</p><p>“How are they going to break out of the siege?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t figure out how Caramel and the others were going to get the ‘Fourth Sword’ and break out of the white hole when they were surrounded by more than ten thrones.</p><p>They even had to break through the blockade outside the White Cave, which was..</p><p>“Wuyue Sword Deity!”</p><p>“How the hell is this possible?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t figure it out himself, so he didn’t dare to act rashly.</p><p>Red Robed, Ghost Beast, Saint Servant..</p><p>And the other miscellaneous forces.</p><p>A small place like the Lijian Grassland actually had the overall situation of no less than three major forces!</p><p>At this moment, he could only see the intentions of one side, and it wasn’t even complete.</p><p>In this situation, it was wise to protect oneself.</p><p>“Junior, listen to me. We must not move recklessly until the last moment. Moreover, we must be prepared to escape to the Abrogated Origin Residence and escape the scene at any time!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression was very grave. “Did you hear that?”</p><p>“OH.”</p><p>Mu Zixi looked straight ahead and obediently replied.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wanted to continue instructing her.</p><p>At this moment, his spiritual sense suddenly moved as if he was pulled into a certain channel.</p><p>The next second, a pleasantly surprised voice was heard.</p><p>“Second Brother, why are you here as well?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
