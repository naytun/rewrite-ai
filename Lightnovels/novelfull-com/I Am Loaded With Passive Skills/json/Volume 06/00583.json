All of them were extremely stifled.</p><p>From Afar, the students of the Spirit Palace could not hold on any longer. After a few “Hello, principal” and “Hello, Elder Qiao”, they ran away and disappeared.</p><p>“They’re all gone, and it’s quiet now.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi stopped in front of the white jade railing and held onto the railing with one hand. As he watched the fat goose frolicking in the water, dishes floated past his mind.</p><p>“How long have they been in there?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian asked as he landed steadily and looked straight ahead.</p><p>However, his line of sight was blocked by the white jade railing and he immediately stood on Tiptoe.</p><p>Helpless.</p><p>He floated in the air again.</p><p>“About half a month ago.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi tapped on the railing with his fingers and said, “Taking into account the time that Old Xiao sent those kids there and then had to bring them back, plus they don’t know when they will come out, I reckon that they should be able to come out in another half a month.”</p><p>“I think it will be soon.” Ye Xiaotian disagreed.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Qiao Qianzhi looked up.</p><p>“Look.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian held the sky above the calm Goose Lake. The reflection of the sky disappeared and was replaced by the ripples of raindrops falling on fan kai.</p><p>“Rain?” Qiao Qianzhi’s eyes moved and looked at the sky.</p><p>The sky was clear and the fleeting white clouds lingered.</p><p>How could there be rain?</p><p>“Yes, it’s rain.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian nodded his head and said, “This is Rain from the Eighth Palace. It only falls within the area of the eighth palace. In other places, no matter how close you are, it won’t be affected at all.”</p><p>“Artificial rain…”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi had already sensed that something was wrong. “Who?”</p><p>“That’s not clear.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian shook his head and looked up. “There are too many water-type ability users in this world. If it’s only at this level, we can’t tell who it is. But the problem is already very serious.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Qiao Qianzhi asked again.</p><p>Just this little bit of rain, how is the problem serious?</p><p>“Look again.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian touched the picture of Goose Lake again.</p><p>This time, it was a middle-aged man in a light blue robe. He had a dignified appearance, black hair, and a blue and white tie on his forehead.</p><p>He carried a golden and pink sword on his back, looking like an immortal. He had a refined temperament and stood out among the group of white-robed men.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi’s gaze did not fall on him, but on the group of unremarkable white-robed men behind the man in the picture.</p><p>“White-clothed!”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi was astonished.</p><p>A person’s temperament could actually overpower the group of white-clothed men in the Holy Divine Palace?</p><p>“He…”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, the man in the picture seemed to have sensed something and turned around.</p><p>Boom</p><p>Huge waves surged up from Goose Lake as if a sword energy had slashed out. The fat geese were so shocked that they flapped their wet short wings and flew in all directions.</p><p>With a whoosh, Ye Xiaotian retracted the image with his little heavenly hand.</p><p>When he turned around, his face was solemn.</p><p>“Gou Wuyue?” Qiao Qianzhi asked.</p><p>“Gou Wuyue,” Ye Xiaotian answered.</p><p>The two of them fell silent at the same time.</p><p>The water of the lake rippled, circle after circle, gathering clouds and twisting the sky.</p><p>Spirit fish that turned white slowly floated up, allowing the waves of the Goose Lake to push them away and reverberate..</p><p>“White Cave, something’s wrong.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi held it in for a long time before he finally said this.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s expression was very solemn. “The communication jade that I refined for those brats in the inner yard previously, I can’t sense it at all now.”</p><p>“Originally, even if we were in the white cave and encountered danger, I could have directly pulled them out.”</p><p>“But now, there’s no movement at all. It’s as if…”</p><p>“Everyone has been imprisoned!”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Qiao Qianzhi knew of Ye Xiaotian’s ability.</p><p>Even in the entire continent, the space type was as rare as a Phoenix’s feather or a Qilin’s horn.</p><p>Even though Ye Xiaotian was currently only a sovereign, in terms of the degree of strangeness of his attributes, he had even surpassed most of the cutting path.</p><p>It was definitely not an easy task to kill Ye Xiaotian’s connection to the communication jade without making a sound.</p><p>“Unless, the White Cave experiencer of the inner yard died in battle at the same time, or they fell into a certain forbidden grounds at the same time and lost contact?” Qiao Qianzhi speculated.</p><p>“It’s possible.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was noncommittal, but he also gave his own opinion. “But the probability is too small. I’m more inclined to think that all the White Cave experiencers have already left the White Cave.”</p><p>“Then, under Gou Wuyue’s watch, no one can send a single message to the outside world.”</p><p>“This possibility is even greater!”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi’s gaze became very serious. “What you said is very likely, but why did the Holy Divine Palace do this? Once they come out, shouldn’t they inform the various powers and the Spirit Palace in time to go and pick them up?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s body floated a little higher and started to spin slowly.</p><p>“That is naturally the case in theory.”</p><p>“But if there are any changes in the White Cave, such as some major suspects entering, those experiencer would be suspected before the matter is settled.”</p><p>“Naturally, they wouldn’t be able to send a message.”</p><p>“And Gou Wuyue was able to bring so many white-clothed people to the White Cave. Previously, all of us thought that he was only going to help capture the Seal Ghost Beast, but now it seems that it’s too ridiculous.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian crossed his hands behind his back and pondered for a moment. With some hesitation in his eyes, he slowly said,</p><p>“If they chased the Storyteller from the central region and lost their way halfway, then Gou Wuyue’s target should still be the Saint Servant.”</p><p>“From the looks of it, not only is it possible that the Storyteller entered the White Cave, but there are also many people inside with the Saint Servant.”</p><p>“This… This is also the reason why Gou Wuyue alone is not enough, and he still needs to call for reinforcements.”</p><p>“Reinforcements?” Qiao Qianzhi was shocked.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian smiled.</p><p>“Otherwise, why do you think I showed you the rain?”</p><p>“Does it seem like it will rain in the Eighth Palace?”</p><p>He pointed at Goose Lake and said, “This picture has been hanging in my spiritual site for a long time, but it suddenly changed two days ago. I had a premonition that something was wrong.”</p><p>“Then what are we waiting for?” Qiao Qianzhi was anxious. “Those are children. Hurry up and find them!”</p><p>“Wait a little longer.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian clasped his hands behind his back and did not move. He looked in another direction.</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi looked in the same direction.</p><p>The two of them did not wait for long.</p><p>In about the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, they saw a young man who was panting and running towards them with his chest wide open.</p><p>The young man had a blade of grass stuck between his teeth.</p><p>In a breath, he appeared in front of the two of them.</p><p>“Principal, Elder Qiao… Hu!” He leaned on his knees and panted.</p><p>“Zhao Xidong?”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi frowned. “You’re back?”</p><p>Ever since he assigned that mission in the cottage, Zhao Xidong had been running around, collecting evidence from all over the place.</p><p>During this period of time, he had not been seen at all.</p><p>Now that he was back..</p><p>“Have you found everything?” Ye Xiaotian asked.</p><p>“Gulp.”</p><p>Zhao Xidong swallowed with difficulty. He opened his mouth and smoke came out of his throat.</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi threw over a water bottle. The latter held it and gulped a few mouthfuls before he said in relief, “We have found everything. However, the information is a little explosive. You have to be mentally prepared.”</p><p>The eyes of the two people in front of them narrowed, and their hearts were filled with anxiety.</p><p>They knew that Zhao Xidong would definitely bring something with him this time.</p><p>And if it was as they had guessed, then Elder Sang..</p><p>“This, this, and this…”</p><p>Zhao Xidong waved his hand without any explanation, and more than ten Jade scroll appeared in the air.</p><p>He puffed up his cheeks and smoothed out his breath before saying, “These are all the information that I’ve found recently about the Vice Dean’s travels around the world. I’ve sorted it out. You can take a look.”</p><p>“Then, let me summarize it first.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian and Qiao Qianzhi each picked up a jade scroll. Their hands stopped in mid-air as they cast their gazes over.</p><p>Zhao Xidong’s face was filled with immense pressure. He shook his head to clear his mind before saying,</p><p>“Sixteen years ago, the Wuyue Sword Deity led a group of white-clothed people and destroyed a huge stronghold of a dark power in the central region. As for the exact power and who they were fighting against, there was no news of it.”</p><p>“But the intelligence that I gathered indicated that the Wuyue Sword Deity was injured in that battle.”</p><p>“And the leader of that stronghold seemed to be a fire-type ability user. It is suspected that… infernal power is called Sleeveless. If nothing goes wrong, he is the Saint Servant’s second-in-command.”</p><p>Crack.</p><p>The jade scroll in Ye Xiaotian’s hand was immediately cracked.</p><p>His gaze paused, and he raised his hand to place the jade scroll between his brows.</p><p>With a sweep of his spiritual senses, the jade scroll shattered into fine powder.</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi’s pupils trembled.</p><p>He did not expect the first piece of information to be so explosive. He carefully put down the jade scroll and said, “Continue.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Zhao Xidong secretly glanced at the Dean’s expression and did not dare to look at it again. He said to himself, “At the same time, our spirit palace is still in its embryonic form. The Vice Dean was still the first dean at that time.”</p><p>“In theory, he didn’t have that much time to leave the Spirit Palace.”</p><p>“At first, I didn’t think about it in this way, but later on, I found out that in the past few months, the Vice Dean wasn’t in the Spirit Palace many times.”</p><p>“And at the time when the Wuyue Sword Deity destroyed the central region’s Saint Servant’s stronghold, he went on a business trip for a long time.”</p><p>“You should know this better. The Spirit Palace’s application requirements are very strict, and there are all sorts of procedures and procedures. At that time, the Lord Dean, who was also the Vice Dean, wanted to personally visit the headquarters of the Holy Divine Palace.”</p><p>“And the headquarters of the Holy Divine Palace is in the Central Region.”</p><p>Zhao Xidong stopped the car in time.</p><p>When he looked up again, he found that the two people in front of him were already calm, and he couldn’t help but think to himself.</p><p>Did he just lose his composure for a moment..</p><p>“Continue.”</p><p>“Oh, OH.”</p><p>Zhao Xidong did not force his own deduction.</p><p>He knew that his duty was to list out the information he had gathered, that was all.</p><p>“After that period of time, the Vice Dean’s temper… well, how should I put it? He was originally quite irritable… cough, cough, I was just being a little direct, right?” Zhao Xidong asked in embarrassment.</p><p>“There’s no harm in saying it.” Ye Xiaotian did not mind. At this moment, he was only paying attention to what Elder Sang had done all these years.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Zhao Xidong continued, “Although he was originally quite hot-tempered, he would not go so far as to violate the rules that he set himself.”</p><p>“But with that period of time as the dividing point, the Vice Dean’s temper has clearly changed.”</p><p>“The most direct feedback was that he violated the Spirit Palace’s rules many times and ignored the notice of the Holy Divine Palace many times.”</p><p>“In the end, he even injured an inner yard disciple who didn’t abide by the rules…”</p><p>Zhao Xidong felt that it was a bit painful to say these words, but he still said with an iron head, “Then he will really become the Vice Dean.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian nodded with a face full of emotions.</p><p>He had been through these things before.</p><p>He only needed a memory to connect them all together.</p><p>“And then?” Qiao Qianzhi asked.</p><p>Zhao xidong said, “After he became the Vice Dean, he basically only focused on conducting alchemy. During that period of time, he built the spiritual medical division of the Spirit Palace very well, and he even received unanimous praise from the founding Elder.”</p><p>“But according to my investigation, during that long period of time, the spiritual medicine division had the most healing elixirs among the abandoned furnaces of the spiritual medicine division, and most of them were top-grade!”</p><p>“Vice Dean even became the Vice President of the Alchemist Association of Tian Sang City. He and Shi Ti had worked together to refine pill formulas many times.”</p><p>“The most direct feedback was the completion of the rejuvenation pill and the development of the most respected healing pill of the fire-type spiritual cultivator — the Chai Yan Pill.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian and Cen Qiaofu nodded at the same time.</p><p>They knew that the Chai Yan Pill was a grade-six healing elixir, at the master stage.</p><p>The price wasn’t high.</p><p>But even for a peak fire-type spiritual cultivator at the sovereign’s seat, it had excellent healing effects and a high value-for-money ratio.</p><p>They all remembered that the Tiansang Spirit Palace had relied on the appearance of this elixir and the cooperation with the Magic Pill Technicians Association to directly solve the financial problem of the Spirit Palace’s early-to-mid-stage development, earning countless benefits.</p><p>However, what did grade-six elixirs mean?</p><p>Zhao Xidong knew what they were thinking and said, “The evolved version of the grade six firewood flame elixir is the grade three ‘Sun Illumination Elixir’.”</p><p>“The reason why the Sun Illumination Elixir is rare is because of the elixir formula that no one knows.”</p><p>“But I used the name of the Vice Dean to communicate with President Shi Ti. I used some underhanded methods, and he vaguely admitted it.”</p><p>“Among the main ingredients of the sun illumination pill, there is a rare thing — Ember Illumination Liquid!”</p><p>This time, Ye Qiao and Zhao Xidong couldn’t stand still.</p><p>Ember Illumination Liquid was something that could only be produced in the brain of the white skeleton, which was unique to the White Cave.</p><p>However, the last time the White Cave opened was only a few years ago.</p><p>The timing of the Sun Illumination Pill’s appearance was too advanced.</p><p>This couldn’t be explained at all!</p><p>Zhao Xidong took a deep breath and said, enunciating each word, “Infernal hell sea.”</p><p>Ye Qiao and Ye Xidong’s expressions froze.</p><p>“Dean, Elder Qiao, you should know.”</p><p>“Vice Dean grew up because of his master’s words in the Holy Palace and his experience in the Infernal Hell Sea alone.”</p><p>“As for White Cave, according to my investigation, it’s basically a weakened version of the Infernal Hell Sea.”</p><p>Zhao Xidong was speechless. He seemed to still be afraid of the shocking information that he had seen for the first time. After a moment of silence, he said,</p><p>“I won’t tell you the details. In any case, I’ve carved the relationship between the fourth sword, the White Cave, and the Infernal Hell Sea into the Jade Scroll. You can learn more about it later</p><p>“Generally speaking, after the battle between the second-in-command of the Saint Servant of the central region, Sleeveless, and the Wuyue Sword Deity, the Vice Dean of the Tiansang Spirit Palace in the eastern region began to improve his healing medicine like a butterfly effect</p><p>“But this still doesn’t mean anything.”</p><p>“But there’s one more thing…”</p><p>Zhao Xidong watched the reaction of the two in front of him and said carefully, “You should have heard about the attack on the Wuyue Sword Deity in Azure Dragon Prefecture a few days ago?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Ye Qiao and Qiao Xidong replied at the same time.</p><p>Azure Dragon Prefecture was very far away from here, and they had never deliberately tried to understand it, so they naturally didn’t know the inside story.</p><p>But at this moment, Zhao Xidong asked this question.</p><p>The problem was big.</p><p>“There’s a connection?” Qiao Qianzhi asked urgently.</p><p>“Yes, there’s a big connection!”</p><p>Zhao Xidong gulped again and said, “Azure Dragon Prefecture had one person who attacked the Wuyue Sword Deity, and one person who assisted him.”</p><p>“Let’s not talk about the latter for the time being, but the attacker displayed a powerful fire-type ability.”</p><p>“I went to the scene to investigate. Although the traces were all wiped away, the smell of the infernal power was something I had experienced when I was still in the inner yard. It’s impossible to get rid of it.”</p><p>“It’s the strengthened version of the Vice Dean!”</p><p>Zhao Xidong’s voice was very powerful. “There aren’t that many people in the world who have the infernal power. Even Xu Xiaoshou in the White Cave can’t do that.”</p><p>“Vice Dean isn’t that strong, and he can’t do it.”</p><p>“Then, there’s only one person left, demi-saint infernal of the Holy Palace, who is also the Vice Dean’s Master!”</p><p>Ye Qiao and Qiao Qianzhi were stunned at the same time.</p><p>“You’re bullshitting!”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi immediately cursed, “Demi-saint infernal would come out and attack the Wuyue Sword Deity. Are you kidding me?”</p><p>Zhao Xidong pulled on his mask of pain and wiped the saliva off his face. He said helplessly, “You know it’s impossible. Then there’s only one outcome.”</p><p>“The attacker is the vice dean of Tiansang Spirit Palace, the second-in-command of the Saint Servant, Sleeveless, who we all thought had the strength of a sovereign.. But in fact, he has already recovered to his peak state in the Central Region.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
