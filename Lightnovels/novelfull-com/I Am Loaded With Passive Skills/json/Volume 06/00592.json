He was almost scared to death by this sudden number.</p><p>“782?”</p><p>There are more than 700 people watching me at the same time?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that it had been a long time since he had seen such a large number of people watching him.</p><p>In the past, the only people who were able to climb up to such a number were those in the platform competition or the surging crowd on the eve of the opening of the Eighth Palace.</p><p>But now..</p><p>Using his “Perception”to scan the crowd, Xu Xiaoshou was able to instantly determine that there were only 60 to 70 white-clothed people in front of him.</p><p>Then, where were the remaining seven hundred eyes hidden?</p><p>For a moment, Xu Xiaoshou felt his heart go numb.</p><p>“Yo, not bad!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu jumped out of the spatial crack and stood in the air. He pulled out the small axe on his waist and loosened his belt.</p><p>The rain on the horizon followed his body and seemed to be completely held up.</p><p>His surging aura rose steadily, and his aura of the Path-Cutting path also began to transform step by step, slowly climbing up to that shocking realm.</p><p>“It really is the Higher Void…”</p><p>Gou Wuyue muttered silently. His gaze moved away from the unconscious masked man on Cen Qiaofu’s back, and then fell on the young man behind the two.</p><p>Square face, full beard, long hair..</p><p>No matter how one looked at it, it didn’t seem like the person from the first-hand information Yu Lingdi had sent.</p><p>And the words that the Night Guardian had just said echoed in his ears once again.</p><p>“That Xu Xiaoshou, if nine out of ten of his words are half true, then that’s enough. As for the remaining half, it’s best not to listen!”</p><p>Gou Wuyue laughed.</p><p>Sure enough, if one wanted to say who had the deepest understanding of Xu Xiaoshou, it would be the Night Guardian who had personally dealt with him several times.</p><p>“Saint Servant?” Gou Wuyue shifted his gaze and asked in a loud voice.</p><p>“Saint Servant!” Cen Qiaofu nodded and said in a deep voice.</p><p>“Hum –”</p><p>The voice of Lan, the famed sword, suddenly trembled, as if it was about to open a new chapter in the battle.</p><p>Gou Wuyue clenched his fists tightly. He did not lower his head, but he could already feel the resentment of the famed sword.</p><p>It seemed that this sword had a grudge with the person who had come!</p><p>“Clang –”</p><p>The fourth sword in Xu Xiaoshou’s hand also shook violently.</p><p>The clang instantly flattened the awe-inspiring sword will that came at him, and the Void was once again quiet.</p><p>“Pitter patter…”</p><p>Rain fell again.</p><p>The silent confrontation seemed to have begun from the first time the two sides met.</p><p>..</p><p>“Where’s Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>On the other side, Qiao Qianzhi was eagerly looking at the three people who had jumped out of the crack and the unconscious corpse… The Saint Servant’s chief?</p><p>He didn’t pay too much attention to them. Instead, he looked behind them.</p><p>However, after the appearance of the four saint servants, the spatial crack behind them started to heal.</p><p>This also meant that the White Cave incident was completely over.</p><p>Everything was over!</p><p>“But… What about Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi couldn’t believe it.</p><p>If that was really the case, they wouldn’t be able to find him in the space that Gou Wuyue had imprisoned, nor would they be able to walk out of the White Cave..</p><p>Where could Xu Xiaoshou go?</p><p>Was he dead?</p><p>“That young man…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian stared at the square-faced, bearded young man. His eyelids drooped as if he had fallen into deep thought.</p><p>“Retreat.”</p><p>After a short while, he beckoned with his hand and brought the few people beside him to the back of the battlefield in a flash, far away from the battlefield.</p><p>“Ye Xiaotian!”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi immediately became anxious. “Xiaoshou is still here…”</p><p>“Calm down.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian reached out his hand to stop Qiao Qianzhi from speaking further and said, “All of you, step back first. I’ll be right back.”</p><p>“Wait…”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi glared and was about to stop him, but the white-haired Dao child disappeared in a flash.</p><p>When he reappeared, he was already in the middle of the confrontation between the white-clothed and the Saint Servant.</p><p>“Gou Wuyue, before you started the battle, you said that as long as I see the person I want to see, I can take him away,” Ye Xiaotian first turned his head to look at Gou Wuyue and said.</p><p>“As you wish.”</p><p>Gou Wuyue extended his hand very generously, as if he did not care at all about what the Master of the Spirit Palace was going to do next.</p><p>He was actually very curious. The person that Ye Xiaotian was going to take away from the Tiansang Spirit Palace would be the Storyteller, Cen Qiaofu, and the Saint Servant’s chief?</p><p>Or was it that Wen Ming who did not look like Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian nodded and cast his gaze on the square-faced, bearded youth. He said indifferently,</p><p>“I am the principal of the Tiansang Spirit Palace’s inner yard. This trip is only to bring back the disciples of the Spirit Palace to the White Cave for training. All the disciples of the Tiansang Spirit Palace’s inner yard can leave with me at this moment.”</p><p>His eyes were burning. He paused for a moment and added, “Just nod.”</p><p>After he said that, everyone could not help but turn their eyes to the young man.</p><p>“Invited, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Received concern, passive points + 4.”</p><p>“Watched, passive points + 782.”</p><p>Headmaster..</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a warmth in his heart.</p><p>With just these words, he was certain that the headmaster had not been subdued by white-clothed, nor was he using those little tricks to verify his identity.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never thought that after the thrilling battle in the White Cave.</p><p>Outside, there were still people waiting for him bitterly.</p><p>“So, I’m not fighting alone…”</p><p>But it was too late!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grinned.</p><p>He already understood that he had reached this step from the middle of the windcloud competition in the outer yard. It was destined from the moment he met Elder Sang.</p><p>The dean was indeed a classic example of a sharp tongue but a soft heart.</p><p>But your appearance was more than one step too late!</p><p>Elder Sang was a Saint Servant. If he hadn’t fed the seed so early, ruo..</p><p>“Cough, cough.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou coughed lightly and interrupted his wild thoughts.</p><p>His face returned to calm and said calmly, “There are more seniors, but I, Tan Ji, am not a disciple of the inner yard of Tiansang Spirit Palace. Perhaps, you have mistaken me for someone else.”</p><p>Tan Ji?</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s heart clenched. This familiar tone..</p><p>He was immediately sure that this person was definitely Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>Fang wanted to continue speaking, but he suddenly remembered something.</p><p>“Inner yard disciple?”</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>Subconsciously, he also thought that the people who came to participate in the White Cave’s experiencer were all inner yard disciples.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t seem to have become an inner yard disciple.</p><p>In name, he was only the eldest senior of the outer yard.</p><p>Although he had secretly become the Vice Dean’s personal disciple, he didn’t have any status, nor did he enjoy the treatment of an inner yard disciple.</p><p>He had even earned the spot to enter the White Cave by himself.</p><p>“Is he holding a grudge?”</p><p>This thought suddenly flashed through Ye Xiaotian’s mind, and he immediately refuted it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not such a stingy person!</p><p>He opened his mouth again, “The inner and outer yard treat each other as their own. As long as you are a member of Tiansang Spirit Palace, you only need to nod your head at this moment…”</p><p>He paused and glanced at the Storyteller and Cen Qiaofu who were watching from the side. Ye Xiaotian said firmly, “No matter who it is, as the principal of Tiansang Spirit Palace’s inner yard, I will take you away!”</p><p>Outer yard is fine too… Xu Xiaoshou found it a little funny.</p><p>He was indeed still remembering that day when he won the windcloud competition, but he could not enter the inner yard.</p><p>But at the moment, he couldn’t care less.</p><p>It wasn’t because he was unwilling, but because he couldn’t!</p><p>Shaking his head indifferently, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t reply.</p><p>He wouldn’t go back with the headmaster.</p><p>Because if he did, perhaps white-clothed’s target would completely shift to the Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>Elder Sang was so secretive. wasn’t he trying to avoid bringing disaster to the Tiansang Spirit Palace?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not that great.</p><p>But he was not sang.</p><p>He would not use the same method to cultivate his disciple just because his master had fed him seeds.</p><p>Similarly, he would put his heart into his heart.</p><p>He, Xu Xiaoshou, would not want to force the fear and trepidation of being trapped in an inexplicable situation on a person from the Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>After all, there were still some memories of the first time he came to this world.</p><p>Other than that damned Wen Ming and Zhang Xinxiong, who were also dead, there were also Elder Qiao, Judge Xiao, Judge Zhao who were looking forward to it from afar..</p><p>There were Zhou Tianshen, Su Qianqian, Mu Zixi..</p><p>There was the spiritual library division that was almost burned down, and the Tianxuan Gate that was almost destroyed..</p><p>There were so many of them!</p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Xiaoshou really wanted to return to his spiritual site and continue to study the art of conducting alchemy. Then, he would find a time to take off the Alchemist badge that did not match his own strength and take the Spirit Array Caster badge to fulfill his hobby of collecting.</p><p>But..</p><p>“Goodbye.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said softly in his heart. He shook his head lightly and took a small step back.</p><p>This step announced his decision.</p><p>Crack</p><p>Ye Xiaotian clenched his fist.</p><p>A crack seemed to have appeared in the air.</p><p>The raindrops and figures disappeared from the sky, leaving only the white-haired Dao child and the square-faced young man.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!” Ye Xiaotian shouted angrily.</p><p>“Called, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked and immediately realized that this was the sovereign’s bounded domain.</p><p>But… wouldn’t they notice it?</p><p>After scanning the surroundings, the rest of them seemed to have really disappeared?</p><p>Was the sovereign really that strong?</p><p>“I have something to say to you.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian paused for a moment before saying in a deep voice, “Alone.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a strange sourness in his nose.</p><p>In such a lonely environment, facing such an elder from the past, the thrilling memories of the white cave flooded his mind. He almost shouted out, “I have some too.”</p><p>But pursing his lips, Xu Xiaoshou did not say it.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian also had a thousand words to say, but his lips and teeth suddenly closed.</p><p>Then he spoke again:</p><p>“Elder Sang…”</p><p>He paused, frowned, and changed the word:</p><p>“Aje…”</p><p>He stopped.</p><p>The two looked at each other in silence.</p><p>There was no wind in the air, and even time had stopped.</p><p>It was as if at this moment, every single matter, big or small, could be brought out and discussed separately.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was like this, and so was Ye Xiaotian.</p><p>He could only feel the worries in his heart. He desperately wanted to jump out of his mouth in such a short period of time and enter the ears of the young man in front of him, so that he could listen in and feel at ease.</p><p>However, every subject of every sentence at this moment was so inappropriate and out of place.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian seemed to have lost the ability to speak. He struggled for a long time, but he could not utter a complete sentence.</p><p>He could see Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes, which had changed his appearance and remained unchanged since ancient times.</p><p>Those eyes would not deceive anyone.</p><p>The young man’s experience was not enough to fool the white-haired Dao child who had been wandering the jianghu for most of his life.</p><p>Who could not tell that this guy, just like Elder Sang, was planning to take on everything by himself so as not to bring disaster to Tiansang Spirit Palace?</p><p>Who was that stupid? !</p><p>Ye Xiaotian heaved a sigh of relief and held his eyelids. No matter how dry his eyes were, he did not dare to blink.</p><p>He floated a little higher and placed his hand on Xu Xiaoshou’s shoulder.</p><p>“Thank you for your hard work.”</p><p>One sentence, three words.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian suppressed all his emotions. “And… survive!”</p><p>Thud.</p><p>He slapped his palm down.</p><p>The scene in front of him blurred and the pitter-patter of rain appeared once again. The tall and straight white-clothed figure entered his eyes once again.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou regained his senses, Ye Xiaotian had already disappeared without a trace.</p><p>He hurriedly looked in the direction of Qiao Qianzhi and saw Elder Qiao, who was secretly wiping his snot and tears away, as well as the four people from the Spirit Palace who had completely disappeared after the headmaster flicked his sleeves.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>With a roar, there were 30% unwillingness and 70% helplessness.</p><p>The mournful flowers and grass scattered all over the ground were swaying in the wind and rain alone.</p><p>“There are so many people standing here…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt that he could feel the temperature of the rain. It was the cold of loneliness!</p><p>..</p><p>“Your name is Tan Ji?”</p><p>Gou Wuyue did not seem to care about the other Saint Servant at all. He kept talking to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Questioned, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Watched, passive points + 782.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his body and shook off the rain that had soaked his clothes. He immediately regained his composure and collected his emotions.</p><p>Now was not the time to be sentimental.</p><p>A great battle was waiting in front of him!</p><p>If he was a little careless, he would be caught in the crossfire..</p><p>He regained his senses and asked, “Is a name that important?”</p><p>“Yes,” Gou Wuyue said with a smile.</p><p>“Alright, I can tell you solemnly that my name is not Tan Ji!”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“Tan Ji, it’s just my name…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded solemnly. “My surname is Xiao Shi.”</p><p>“Xiao Shi, Tan Ji?”</p><p>Gou Wuyue was stunned.</p><p>“Suspected, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Doubted, passive points + 782.”</p><p>“Mocked, passive points + 345.”</p><p>“Liked, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Hehehe…”</p><p>The Storyteller covered his mouth and laughed. After a long while, he said, “Little Shi, Tan Ji, there’s no need to talk to them. No matter how much we talk, Will they let us go?”</p><p>“Questioned, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Yes.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded seriously.</p><p>This time, not only was he talking about books, everyone was shocked by his confidence.</p><p>He was obviously so ordinary..</p><p>How could he dare to be so sure?</p><p>Could it be that he was a fool?</p><p>“Suspected, passive points + 780.”</p><p>“Criticized, passive points + 663.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not care about talking about books. Instead, he looked up at the middle-aged man who was dressed like a swordsman and had an extraordinary bearing.</p><p>Then, he bowed deeply.</p><p>After pondering for three breaths, he stood up, took a deep breath, and said seriously,</p><p>“I believe that Elder is the legendary person who was able to kill Saint Servant No. 2 and escape. He chased after Saint Servant No. 7 and ran all over the two regions. He even nurtured disciples with excellent bearing and amazing potential. He even led white-clothed to destroy countless evil forces many times. He was the ruler of the Holy Divine Palace and fought for the title of ten seats. He was one of the top experts in the world among the seven sword deity. Gou Wuyue, gou… Ah pui, Elder Wuyue?” Xu Xiaoshou’s face was full of respect.</p><p>Gou Wuyue: “…”</p><p>White-clothed: “…”</p><p>Storyteller, Cen Qiaofu: ? ? ?</p><p>“Suspected, passive points + 780.”</p><p>“Mocked, passive points + 423.”</p><p>“Conjecture, passive points, + 644.”</p><p>What was he trying to do?</p><p>At this moment, the corners of everyone’s mouths twitched, and this question popped up at the same time.</p><p>Even the usually calm Wuyue Sword Deity couldn’t remain calm at this moment.</p><p>For a moment, he didn’t dare to completely agree.</p><p>This title was too important, and he almost didn’t hear everything. He had no idea what the young man in front of him wanted to do.</p><p>However, the other party had a respectful expression on his face. If he didn’t reply, it would be too ungraceful.</p><p>“What do you want to express?”</p><p>Gou Wuyue pressed down on the famed sword that was about to move.</p><p>“I just want to express my deep respect for Elder Wuyue…”</p><p>Looking at the trembling hands of the other party, Xu Xiaoshou increased the speed of his speech, eliminating the ten thousand words of flattery that would follow. He went straight to the end, “As well as the fact that I am an esteemed person, I don’t dare to speak recklessly and interfere in Elder Wuyue’s matters.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“Matters?”</p><p>Everyone was stunned. Gou Wuyue also frowned, unable to understand.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled embarrassedly and rubbed his hands. After scanning the crowd for a week, he said,</p><p>“To put it simply, it’s a war between the elders of the sovereign stage and above. This junior might not be able to interfere. Can I choose to watch?”</p><p>He shrank his neck and said timidly, “Who will win? Who will I follow? The kind who will leave obediently and never resist…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
