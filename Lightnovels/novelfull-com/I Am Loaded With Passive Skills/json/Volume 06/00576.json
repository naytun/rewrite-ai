Do you still think that the current you is the old you?”</p><p>“You’re only at the Acquired Realm now, why are you still rushing at the spatial fragment?”</p><p>“I’m so angry!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu even wished that he could give the person on the ground a few more slaps.</p><p>But he also realized something.</p><p>This kind of slapping was unable to wake up the unconscious person on the ground.</p><p>“Damn it.”</p><p>Gritting his teeth, Cen Qiaofu pulled out the small axe on his waist. With a fierce expression, he raised it high.</p><p>“Cough cough…”</p><p>At this moment, the unconscious person on the ground suddenly coughed violently twice, and then…</p><p>“Plop!”</p><p>The sound of blood spurting only lasted for half a second before it was forcefully suppressed back.</p><p>The masked man flipped over on the ground at the speed of light.</p><p>“What are you doing?!”</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>A drop of sweat dripped down from Cen Qiaofu’s face. He sheepishly withdrew his hand, “It’s not what you think.”</p><p>“Then what is it?”</p><p>“Saving you!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s anger flared up at the mention of saving him.</p><p>“I already said to let me do it. Can’t you be obedient?”</p><p>“Are you a child?”</p><p>“Can you withstand the spatial fragment?”</p><p>The masked man said nothing, his eyes still fixed on his small axe.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu rolled his eyes, “If I can’t wake you up with normal methods, I can only wake you up with pain!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The scene was a little silent.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu took two steps back, looked away, and looked at the world of the White Cave.</p><p>After saying “Ah,” he said, “Sure enough, there is movement in the White Cave. I guess it won’t be long before it breaks.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Where is that Storyteller?”</p><p>“Shouldn’t he appear at the first moment and send the information over?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Ha, the weather is pretty good…”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu was finally embarrassed by himself. He couldn’t help but turn his head and roar, “You won’t die anyway. One swing of the axe will definitely wake you up. In this situation, can you sleep?”</p><p>“That’s true,” The masked man finally swallowed back the blood that had flowed out of his mouth.</p><p>He could feel that his injuries had become more serious.</p><p>“Something is wrong.”</p><p>He staggered to his feet. The masked man looked around, but there was no one around.</p><p>He closed his eyes and opened them. There seemed to be sword light flashing in his eyes.</p><p>“There’s no one.”</p><p>“The guys from White Cave, including the Experiencer, all seem to have left?”</p><p>Turning his head, he looked at Cen Qiaofu with an inquiring look.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu sighed, “You have indeed regressed.”</p><p>After calming himself down, he continued, “One wave from the Lijian Grassland and one at the entrance of the black hole should be the key point of the collapse of the White Cave. As for the Storyteller…”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s pupils were out of focus. He looked around and said in disappointment, “That guy’s ability to escape is great. Basically, he won’t let his real body come out to meet people. It’s normal that he can’t be found.”</p><p>“What else?” the masked man asked.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu didn’t understand, “What else?”</p><p>The masked man didn’t say anything. He slowly raised a finger, and the two of them fell silent at the same time.</p><p>“…”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>“Rustle…”</p><p>The sound of the wind.</p><p>“Crack–”</p><p>The sound of space cracking.</p><p>“Pitter-patter…”</p><p>The sound of rain!</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s pupils suddenly constricted.</p><p>“Rain?”</p><p>He suppressed the head that he subconsciously wanted to raise and turned his head to look at the Chief in disbelief.</p><p>“Ha,” the masked man sighed and laughed. He did not have any intention of concealing it.</p><p>“When did it start to rain in the Infernal Hell Sea?”</p><p>Without even the slightest intention of concealing it, the masked man raised his head and looked directly at the curtain of rain in the Nine Heavens.</p><p>He was obviously still very weak, but in his dictionary, there did not seem to be the word ‘retreat’ at all.</p><p>If there was a problem, there was no other way to solve it other than facing it directly.</p><p>“Hum –”</p><p>An extremely subtle but very ear-piercing high-frequency sword cry seemed to rush out from those turbid eyes and cut straight at the sky.</p><p>“Sizzle~”</p><p>The curtain of rain broke.</p><p>Then.</p><p>“Pitter-patter…”</p><p>It continued to fall without any other movement.</p><p>The curtain was three feet high, tied to the Nine Heavens, hanging above the hearts of people.</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu was uneasy.</p><p>He did not want to expose the other party so quickly.</p><p>But his Chief was exposed, so he could not let him confront that inexplicable person.</p><p>Taking a step forward, Cen Qiaofu stood in front of the masked man and shouted again, “Who is it?”</p><p>“Who is it?!”</p><p>“Pitter-patter pitter-patter…”</p><p>The rain was still pouring. There was not even a hint of sluggishness. It was as if it had been hanging in the sky above the White Cave since ancient times.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu seemed to feel that his neck was numb. He subconsciously lowered his eyebrows.</p><p>Then, as if he had been electrocuted, his entire body tensed up and he suddenly raised his head again.</p><p>“Who is it?!”</p><p>This time, his heart was in turmoil.</p><p>He had overlooked it?</p><p>Just now, he was staring straight at it, but at that moment, he was in a daze, as if he was…</p><p>“Hypnotized?”</p><p>The masked man’s amused gaze finally shifted from the rain curtain to Cen Qiaofu, and he said slowly, “To be able to hypnotize you until now, it means that this is a person who had at least mastered the Power of the Higher Void.”</p><p>“But the Higher Void can not enter the Infernal Hell Sea, or it will only backfire.”</p><p>“That means that this person is at most at the peak of the Cutting Path Level and has transcended the nine Death Thunder Calamity, yet he has the power to fight against the Higher Void.”</p><p>“Or perhaps, the last explanation…”</p><p>The masked man paused for a moment and looked at Cen Qiaofu’s shocked gaze. He nodded and said, “Just like you, he has sealed his cultivation level.”</p><p>“I’ll chop him up!”</p><p>With a whoosh, Cen Qiaofu pulled out the axe from his waist and was about to charge into the sky.</p><p>“Don’t worry.”</p><p>The masked man reached out his hand to stop him. He glanced at the sky and smiled. “That person just wants to be an open peeping tom and is not going to make a move. Why are you being so impolite?”</p><p>“Besides…”</p><p>He shifted his gaze. Wherever he looked, there was a curtain of rain.</p><p>“The rain is so heavy. Can your small axe cut through it?”</p><p>“Even if it can’t, it can still cut through this world.”Cen Qiaofu was anxious. This kind of sneaky person should be cut into halves!</p><p>“Sigh.”</p><p>The masked man nodded to show his approval, and then he said, “But the others are still here. This world can’t be broken…”</p><p>Glancing at the sky, he seemed to be thinking.</p><p>“It can not be broken either.”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu: “…”</p><p>Since the Chief had said so, he was not angry to the point of being enraged. He immediately put down the hand holding the axe.</p><p>“Who?” He asked.</p><p>“I’m not sure,” the masked man shook his head, “But it should be someone from the Holy Divine Palace? Without him, this White Cave should have been broken… so who can it be?”</p><p>He changed the topic and threw the question to the elder in front of him.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu rolled his eyes, “The people I know have already turned into ashes. How could I remember such a person?”</p><p>“That’s true.”</p><p>The masked man nodded immediately. He thought for a moment and tapped his fingers. “I remember now. It seems that there was a child before. He was a water-type with great potential?”</p><p>“Oh, you still remember people?” Cen Qiaofu was surprised.</p><p>“I told you, his potential is not bad.”</p><p>The masked man did not care and said, “I forgot about what happened decades ago, but if nothing unexpected happens, his father should be…”</p><p>He slowly raised his head.</p><p>“He died at my hands.”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s eyebrows jumped, and he also looked up into the sky.</p><p>“Pitter-patter…”</p><p>The rain was still the same. There was no sign of it getting bigger or smaller.</p><p>It didn’t even feel like it was slowing down.</p><p>It was continuous and had no sudden movement at all.</p><p>“Good disposition!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu laughed, “As expected of a water-type ability user. The sea accepts all rivers. There is tolerance!”</p><p>The masked man frowned when he heard that.</p><p>“It’s just a normal fight. Why are you mocking him? He might just be a child.”</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu choked for a moment and didn’t know what to say.</p><p>“Pitter-patter…”</p><p>The rain continued to fall, and the scene fell silent.</p><p>The two of them retracted their gazes and looked at each other in silence.</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>At this moment, the masked man’s expression suddenly changed, and he looked into the distance.</p><p>“Someone is coming?”</p><p>..</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>A sword pierced through the air.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gently held the hilt of the Fourth Sword, allowing it to freely fly to the other shore of happiness.</p><p>Travelling at high speed did not cause much pain to the Master Physique.</p><p>At this moment, the desire for freedom in Xu Xiaoshou’s heart suppressed the pain in his body even more.</p><p>“Soon…”</p><p>“Soon!”</p><p>He could completely sense that the direction in which the Fourth Sword was heading was so straight.</p><p>If he continued on his way, he might really be able to pass through the weakest space node of the White Cave and return to the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>However, not long after, the white light bead in his mind reported again.</p><p>This time, it seemed to be much louder than usual.</p><p>“Om…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind was suddenly jolted awake.</p><p>“What does it mean?”</p><p>“White bead, abnormal movement?”</p><p>Suddenly, he clenched the Fourth Sword in his hand, and Xu Xiaoshou forced himself to stop.</p><p>This white bead was the inheritance of the wretched saint.</p><p>By relying on the map of the White Cave on top of it, Xu Xiaoshou had already obtained great benefits.</p><p>However, in the past, this thing would not fluctuate randomly.</p><p>The only time that was unusual was when he had asked the wretched saint to help him suppress the Infernal Original Seed.</p><p>Now…</p><p>“Something’s wrong!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the Fourth Sword in his hand that was shaking more and more violently. He suddenly realized that what if this sword did not sense his intentions and wanted to take him out of the White Cave?</p><p>Then what was it doing now?</p><p>Taking advantage of the moment when the map of the White Cave appeared, Xu Xiaoshou looked up and his heart suddenly tightened.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>The place where the Fourth Sword took him was actually the deepest part of the map of the White Cave, where the extradimensional cracks were located.</p><p>“Are you kidding me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was scared silly.</p><p>He didn’t think that the crack could lead to the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>If what the Storyteller had said was true, the Chief of Saint Servant should be in the crack at this moment.</p><p>If he went over like this, wouldn’t he be walking into a trap?</p><p>“Calm down…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wanted the Fourth Sword to stop trembling but it seemed to really sense his intention.</p><p>“Clang!” There was a huge tremor.</p><p>The vicious sword directly released the demonic power and pulled Xu Xiaoshou forward at the speed of light.</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wanted to let go of the Fourth Sword, but at this time, he realized that his palm seemed to have been completely sucked in.</p><p>The demonic power continuously poured into his body.</p><p>He couldn’t even let go of it!</p><p>“F*ck…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was going crazy.</p><p>“Am I Tang Seng? Do you really want to make things difficult for me?”</p><p>He had just escaped from the jaws of a tiger, and now he was going to enter the death realm again?</p><p>“Open it for me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou compressed the force in his hand again. He wanted to use the recoil force to bounce himself away from the hilt of the Fourth Sword.</p><p>But he couldn’t do it.</p><p>He didn’t even have the time to exert force. The demonic power that crazily surged into his body almost destroyed his consciousness completely.</p><p>“Ma Ma…” Aje’s stone muttered softly and began to absorb the demonic power.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou regained a bit of clarity and immediately shouted, “Break your hand!”</p><p>“Ma Ma?” Aje was stunned.</p><p>“Quick, chop off my hand!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced ahead and was already very close.</p><p>He could faintly feel that there was a vitality breath in front of him.</p><p>That was the Chief of the Saint Servant!</p><p>How could he go over?</p><p>“Quick!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and said anxiously.</p><p>When Aje was in a daze earlier, his mind was almost destroyed by the demonic power.</p><p>Has the Fourth Sword gone mad?</p><p>How could it suddenly have such a huge force?</p><p>“Ma Ma!” Aje called out firmly.</p><p>Aje could not hurt Ma Ma, who had brought it to freedom.</p><p>“Rejected, passive points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost vomited blood.</p><p>He did not have time to explain too much to Aje.</p><p>But now, it seemed that he could not do it without explaining.</p><p>“Listen to me…”</p><p>The words were on the tip of his tongue, but before he could finish, Xu Xiaoshou froze.</p><p>Up ahead…</p><p>Sword Will!</p><p>That familiar Sword Will, even if he had only seen it once in Tiansang Spirit Palace… he would never forget it!</p><p>“Gulp.”</p><p>His throat suddenly felt a little dry. Xu Xiaoshou suddenly realized that there was nothing he could do.</p><p>He had yet to meet the person, but he felt that he was only left with a dead end.</p><p>How could it be like this?</p><p>Why is this world so malicious towards him?</p><p>..</p><p>“It’s coming.”</p><p>At the spatial crack, the masked man stared ahead with a slight smile in his eyes.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu took a step forward and directly blocked his chest.</p><p>As expected, a figure flew out in the next moment.</p><p>“Brother~”</p><p>“How did you sense him? He even thought he was hiding well!”</p><p>The Storyteller opened his arms and completely ignored the elder in front of the masked man.</p><p>The corner of Cen Qiaofu’s mouth twitched.</p><p>So it was this guy?</p><p>He was hiding nearby?</p><p>No wonder he couldn’t find him just now…</p><p>Seeing the person in front of him was about to pounce on him, Cen Qiaofu immediately dodged to the side and gave way to the masked man behind him.</p><p>He didn’t want to be hugged by this pervert!</p><p>“Big Brother~” the delicate voice called out again.</p><p>A trace of doubt flashed through the masked man’s eyes, but he soon understood.</p><p>He waited for the Storyteller to approach before suddenly lowering his body.</p><p>Then.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>“Aiyo.”</p><p>The battered Storyteller pulled himself out of the mud and punched the masked man in the chest with his small fist.</p><p>“You’re so hateful~”</p><p>“You came alone?” the masked man slapped his hand away.</p><p>“Uh-huh~”</p><p>The Storyteller pouted, “What?”</p><p>The masked man sensed that something was wrong, “You brought me a famed sword?”</p><p>“Famed sword?” the Storyteller repeated in a daze, “No!”</p><p>The Storyteller only brought him a ghost beast as a gift and hadn’t given it to him yet.</p><p>Famed sword?</p><p>He had seen a few of these, but how could it be so easy to snatch them?</p><p>The last one was still on that Wen Ming!</p><p>“That’s strange…”</p><p>The masked man frowned, “Why do I smell the aura of a sword?”</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>A ray of black light suddenly rushed towards him at lightning speed.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu was originally far away, afraid that his ears would be stained. This time, he could not help but roar and fly over with the small axe in his hand.</p><p>At the same time, the Storyteller’s face also paled.</p><p>“Brother, be careful!”</p><p>He immediately took a step forward and pushed the masked man away, and then stood in his place.</p><p>However, the black light seemed to have eyes. When it reached the chest of the Storyteller, it turned towards the direction where the masked man fell, directly penetrating his chest.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>The eyes of the masked man almost popped out.</p><p>He opened his mouth and with a “Plop” sound, blood covered his face in the mask.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>His head tilted and the masked man fainted on the spot.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
