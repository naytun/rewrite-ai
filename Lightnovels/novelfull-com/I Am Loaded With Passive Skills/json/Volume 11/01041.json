Qiao Qianzhi'S Request (2)</h1><p>Chapter 1041: Another Path to Saint Ascension! Qiao Qianzhi’s Request (2)</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was stunned. He understood that the Holy Divine Palace had decided to exterminate the Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>He had not thought about it before, but now that he heard Qiao Qianzhi’s words, Ye Xiaotian felt a chill down his spine.</p><p>That was right!</p><p>His subjective impression of the Tiansang Spirit Palace was still normal.</p><p>However, as time passed, more and more things happened. Elder Sang, who came from the Tiansang Spirit Palace, had been taken away. Xu Xiaoshou joined the dark faction, and he had also inexplicably become opposed to the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>This…</p><p>Ye Xiaotian felt troubled in an instant. He stared at the Saint Origin Crystal in his hand as if he saw a hot potato.</p><p>“Ye Xiaotian, what have you done out there?” Qiao Qianzhi could no longer suppress his anger after he finished speaking. “If you want to die, why don’t you just find a place to bury yourself? There are still so many little fellows in the Spirit Palace. Do you want them to be buried with you?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was silent for a long time before he spoke up.</p><p>“I have already resigned and become a free man. Now that Xiao Qixiu is the new dean, anything I do has nothing to do with the Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>“No matter how powerful the Holy Divine Palace is, if they really want to punish the Spirit Palace, they have to get the approval of the Holy Palace. They will never be able to get around this.</p><p>“If they want to by past the Holy Palace, Elder Sang, you, me, and Old Xiao still have a way to get past the Holy Palace. So don’t worry, they will never be able to touch the Tiansang Spirit Palace.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi was furious when he heard that.</p><p>“But what about you?</p><p>“What have you done in the Yunlun Mountain Range? Even the Holy Divine Palace came after you. If you continue to do this, you will die!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian chuckled. He flicked his sleeves casually and said, “You don’t have to worry about me. Don’t forget, I’m now at the final stage of Space Upanishad.”</p><p>He paused for a moment as if he had recalled something, he then sneered and said, “Just now, I met Yama’s boss, Huang Quan. That guy’s cultivation level is Higher Void (level), and he can control the power of space and time. He was very fierce… But when he met me, what was the outcome?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian stretched out his hand and grabbed the air. He fiercely slapped down and said, “I almost smashed him into pieces with my Hand of Ripping Heaven!”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi seemed to be shocked. Only now did he realize that there were some traces of blood on Ye Xiaotian’s clothes. He asked worriedly, “Are you injured?”</p><p>“Injured?” Ye Xiaotian’s voice became louder as he pulled at his collar and laughed. “This… is his blood!”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi was stunned for a long time before he muttered softly, “Spatial Upanishad, is it really that strong…”</p><p>“I’ve long told you to cultivate seriously,” Ye Xiaotian sneered, and his eyes filled with disdain. “Anyway, you don’t have to worry about me. Even if you encounter Bazhun’an… I can immediately take revenge for the night battle of the Spirit Palace.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi rolled his eyes, “Take care of yourself. Leave the Spirit Palace to me and Old Xiao. You don’t have to worry about the escape route. We will take care of it. After you are done with Elder Sang’s matter, you should quickly leave that troublesome place in the Yunlun Mountain Range!”</p><p>“I can leave anytime,” Ye Xiaotian weighed the Saint Origin Crystal in his hand.</p><p>At this moment, Qiao Qianzhi seemed to have thought of something and hesitation flashed across his eyes.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian caught it and immediately asked, “What else do you want to say?”</p><p>“You…” Qiao Qianzhi was still a little hesitant. However, when he thought of what Ye Xiaotian had said about the final stage of the Spatial Upanishad, he calmed down and said, “Since you can come and go as you please now and are still in the Yunlun Mountain Range, I may need your help. You just need to do what you can.”</p><p>“What kind of help?” Ye Xiaotian paused as he spoke, and a look of realization appeared on his face. “Has there been any results from your research on the Divine Secret technique?”</p><p>“Hehehe…” Qiao Qianzhi was so happy that he couldn’t help but laugh out loud as he corrected him, “It’s the final step in the research on the Divine Puppet. I’ve found a way to crack it. If it succeeds, I’ll be one step ahead of Hallmaster Dao and develop a Demi-Saint stage Divine Puppet that can evolve on its own!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was petrified on the spot. He was a little dumbfounded.</p><p>After a long while, he panted and said, “You’re not kidding, are you?”</p><p>“Hehe…” Qiao Qianzhi chuckled and retorted, “I’ve told you to learn the Way of Spirit Array and the Divine Path from me. They’re the foundation of breaking the mysteries of the world… Spiritual Cultivation? Hmph, isn’t it enough as long as you have hands?”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi held his chopsticks with his hands behind his back and puffed out his chest proudly.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was choked and speechless. His mind was filled with thoughts.</p><p>Back in the time of the Holy Palace, there were many geniuses. Qiao Qianzhi proposed the idea of “not following the same path as the secular world”. He then had resolutely walked the path of spiritual array.</p><p>With his comprehension quality, he was able to surpass the rest on the path of Spiritual Cultivation. If he really decided to walk the path of Spiritual Array, everyone believed that he would have good achievements.</p><p>After all, the Holy Palace was a place to cultivate a saint.</p><p>Theoretically speaking, those who could enter that place to cultivate were all geniuses from the five regions, and all of them had the potential to become a saint.</p><p>However, it was already too late to change halfway.</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi’s choice had been ridiculed by many of his peers. In fact, for a long time, his cultivation level had fallen to the bottom of his peers’ level, and he had almost been expelled from the Holy Palace under the survival of the fittest.</p><p>At that time, Spirit Array and Divine Seceet were not the goals people would pursue.</p><p>Even Dao Qiongcang wasn’t famous at that time. The Divine Secret technique was occasionally heard of in the continent, but no one could be the leader of the world.</p><p>Without a goal, Qiao Qianzhi still persisted. He still firmly believed that “vein” was the secret of all things.</p><p>For example, the bones and veins of the human body, the growth rings of the plants, and the growth texture of all things…</p><p>As long as one could master these “biological vein patterns” that corresponded to the “Spiritual Vein” and “Path Vein” that evolved from Spiritual Array, Divine Array, and the dead objects, one could easily become a saint.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
