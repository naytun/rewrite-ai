It could be said that there was nothing wrong with Night Guardian being seriously injured.</p><p>What shocked Rao Yaoyao the most was that at this moment, what did Huang Quan mean by taking out Night Guardian?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao already had a bad premonition in her heart.</p><p>The law enforcers were just as hesitant and shocked as Sword Deity Rao. At the same time, Ye Xiaotian and Lei Xi’er, who were on the same side, were also shocked.</p><p>The former was shocked because, in his speculation, Night Guardian should have fallen into the bottom of Lone Cliff. How could another Night Guardian appear?</p><p>Ye Xiaotian simply could not understand.</p><p>Lei Xi’er was even more confused. She had seen with her own eyes that Night Guardian had been kicked off the Lone Cliff by Xu Xiaoshou, but now, there was another Night Guardian…</p><p>“Is that his… that kind of clone?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er realized something, but at the same time, she could not believe it.</p><p>This new Night Guardian and the two members of Huang Quan with Lei family’s eyes were too lifelike!</p><p>…</p><p>“What do you want?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao could not remain calm and spoke in a dignified tone.</p><p>She realized that ever since Huang Quan had transformed into Xu Xiaoshou, then into Yi, before returning to his real body, the situation was all under the control of the other party.</p><p>Moreover, at this time, even if she wanted to make a move forcefully, she felt that it was not realistic at all when she thought of the other party’s time attribute.</p><p>She could only wait!</p><p>Wait for that brat to complete his plan!</p><p>“As I said, let’s make a deal.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was sitting upright in the space, was still as calm as ever. It was as if taking down a Night Guardian was not a problem at all. It was not even something worthy for him to be proud of.</p><p>“What’s the deal?” Rao Yaoyao asked, in an attempt to drag out the situation.</p><p>Upon seeing that the other party was falling into his trap step by step, Xu Xiaoshou smiled lightly and said, “One person, in exchange for a sword.”</p><p>Sword?</p><p>Hearing this, everyone present was shocked.</p><p>The value of Night Guardian… what sword could he be exchanged for?</p><p>It was not to the extent of…</p><p>All the law enforcers turned around with a whoosh and focused on the Cang Godhood Sword in Rao Yaoyao’s hand.</p><p>No way, no way?!</p><p>“What sword?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao also saw the look in Huang Quan’s eyes under the mask. She suddenly found the situation humorous. What was he thinking of? Did he really think he could control the situation just because he took down Night Guardian?</p><p>“Cang Godhood Sword.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said what everyone was thinking indifferently.</p><p>As soon as he said this, the entire place was in an uproar.</p><p>“Cang Godhood Sword? Huang Quan must be crazy. Even if Elder Night Guardian is powerful, how can he match up to the value of the Cang Godhood sword alone?”</p><p>“Exactly, this is the fate suppression treasure of the headquarters. Is he joking?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Just as the commotion started, Wang Dachui snorted and the entire place fell silent.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao shook her head. She didn’t expect Huang Quan to be so brazen.</p><p>How could Night Guardian and the Cang Godhood Sword be equivalent?</p><p>If it was something else, Rao Yaoyao could admit that she was unlucky and make the exchange. She would first redeem Night Guardian before anything else.</p><p>But the Cang Godhood Sword…</p><p>It could not be used as a trade!</p><p>“Are you joking?” Rao Yaoyao snorted coldly. She lifted the Cang Godhood Sword and slowly floated in the air, facing off against Huang Quan who was sitting upright in space.</p><p>“Of course, I was joking…” Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself. How could he possibly offer an equivalent trade and make her, Rao Yaoyao, agree to it? If he really swapped Night Guardian’s portrait clone with her, wouldn’t he be exposed on the spot?</p><p>However, did he make the identity of “Huang Quan” seem rather brainless by using Night Guardian to propose this completely unequal deal?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was naturally confident in his actions.</p><p>“I’m not only swapping this person with you but also many of his secrets…”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou spoke, he pointed in the direction of Night Guardian. At the right time, he used his spiritual senses to control Night Guardian to struggle and wriggle. The portrait clone then ended up failing and his face was filled with despair.</p><p>No more words were needed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that Rao Yaoyao could imagine what he was going to say next.</p><p>Night Guardian had big secrets!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could see this point from the power of a higher void that Night Guardian had displayed earlier.</p><p>If there was no special reason, how could a cutting path possess the power of a higher void?</p><p>This was simply unrealistic!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not know how Night Guardian obtained the power of a higher void, but he immediately thought of a young man in the red-clothed, Lu Ke!</p><p>Lu Ke was a member of the red-clothed that he once met in the White Cave. The young man had once lost control of his body and revealed ghostly energy, a power that belonged solely to the Ghost Beast!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not know if the power of the higher void in Night Guardian was inextricably linked to the young Lu Ke’s ghostly energy.</p><p>However, he knew that even if there was no connection, Night Guardian was not an ordinary red-clothed member.</p><p>He also believed that he did not need to say what he did not know personally, because Rao Yaoyao, as an internal member of the Holy Divine Palace, must know everything!</p><p>Just click it.</p><p>As expected, after he said “Secret,” Rao Yaoyao fell silent.</p><p>Under the shocked expressions of all the law enforcers, she seemed to be weighing the pros and cons of the secret between the Cang Godhood Sword and Night Guardian.</p><p>“Is this secret so important?”</p><p>Even though Rao Yaoyao quickly recovered her usual expression, the momentary weighing still gave Xu Xiaoshou some hope.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
