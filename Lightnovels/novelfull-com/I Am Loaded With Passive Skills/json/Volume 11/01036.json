(2)</p><p>“What had happened to Senior Yi that had caused him not to break the deadlock in the first instance and to choose to flee?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s eyes were unperturbed. She was not affected the slightest by Night Guardian’s impassioned words.</p><p>What Night Guardian said was also the doubt in her heart. It was… hitting the nail right on the head.</p><p>Wang Dachui swept a glance at Deity Rao. The corners of his mouth twitched as he mocked, “In your deduction, are you trying to use your deduction to prove that your deduction is valid?”</p><p>Night Guardian glanced at Wang Dachui in astonishment. He did not expect such a person to be able to say such a mouthful of words.</p><p>He still did not respond. He only looked at Rao Yaoyao and continued.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“If Xu Xiaoshou was involved in this matter, he must be the mastermind of it.</p><p>“Storyteller of the Saint Servant has the ability, but most of his abilities are displayed in escape, control, fake spatial abilities, and so on. He lacks the agile thinking to lead the entire battle against Yi, which is the ability to see the big picture.</p><p>“Patriarch Wuji, assuming the Divine Sorcerer is Patriarch Wuji… Patriarch Wuji has been trapped in Abyss Island for so long, and he has been estranged from the battle, especially in this kind of battle that requires meticulous planning… If he really met Yi in the Yunlun Mountain Range, even if he had made thorough preparations, his desire for revenge would have destroyed his rationality. Yi couldn’t be killed silently without even finding a flaw in the divine secret.</p><p>“He must have been deterred by someone… or to put it bluntly, he must have been led by the nose.”</p><p>Night Guardian paused for a moment, and his voice became solemn. “It could only be Xu Xiaoshou. He is best at defeating the strong with the weak, leading the situation, and making the enemy walk step by step into the trap that he has hidden beforehand!”</p><p>“Pfft!” Wang Dachui finally could not help but laugh out aloud.</p><p>After laughing for a long while, he finally restrained his emotions, and the corners of his mouth curled up as he ridiculed, “Night Guardian? You’re Night Guardian, aren’t you… Night Guardian, I don’t know what had happened between you and that Saint Servant, Xu Xiaoshou. But you, a Cutting Path (stage), seem to have been scared out of your wits by that brat?”</p><p>Night Guardian calmly glanced at Wang Dachui, thinking that Yi might have died because of such contempt.</p><p>He ignored Wang Dachui, who was rather angry because he had neglected him. After all, he was a member of the Physique Division. But even if he was the chief of the Physique Division, Night Guardian was directly under Rao Yaoyao. As he was not under the jurisdiction of the Physique Division, he didn’t need to give him face.</p><p>Night Guardian looked at Rao Yaoyao, the Ruler of the red-clothed people who followed the path, and who had fallen into deep thought because of his words. He quietly waited.</p><p>At this moment, he suddenly thought that if the leader of this move was Gou Wuyue, then perhaps he did not need to make these remarks.</p><p>It was because Moonless Sword Deity had personally experienced Xu Xiaoshou’s ability. With his gentle reminder, the other party would take it very seriously.</p><p>However, Sword Deity Rao was different. Before what happened in Dongtianwang City, she had never even heard of the Saint Servant, Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“What do you want to say?” Rao Yaoyao pondered for a while, then finally spoke.</p><p>Night Guardian took a deep breath and said sincerely, “I would like Sword Deity Rao to pay more attention to Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou. He’s not the type of person whom we can afford to only pay attention to for a while. The existence of this person, if we ignore him, will somehow interrupt our rhythm. He…”</p><p>Night Guardian thought for a long time, but he could not find a suitable adjective for Xu Xiaoshou. He could only try his best to describe it: “He is very ‘cunning!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao smiled and said, “You seem to be very sure that Xu Xiaoshou was transformed by Bazhun’an. Are you very sure?”</p><p>Night Guardian lowered his head and shook it imperceptibly. He then said, “Not only about this matter, but I also want to say that if this person is left alone, there will definitely be an even bigger mess in the future!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao nodded and resumed her solemn expression. “Xu Xiaoshou, I have always attached great importance to him.”</p><p>Night Guardian still lowered his head and shook his head.</p><p>However, this time, he shook his head harder, to the extent that he even spoke impudently.</p><p>“No! Sword Deity Rao, the importance you speak of is only the kind of importance that a senior has on a junior…</p><p>“I’ve had such importance on him before, and I’m certain that all the higher-ups of the Holy Divine Palace will have it.</p><p>“But it’s far from enough!</p><p>“What I mean is…”</p><p>Night Guardian paused for a moment, and said solemnly, “Xu Xiaoshou can no longer be considered a junior. If you ‘belittle’ him with the name of ‘attaching importance’ to him’… Even you might be in danger!”</p><p>“Impudent!” Wang Dachui shouted angrily. He could not believe that a subordinate of the red-clothed people would dare to speak to Deity Rao in such a manner.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s eyes also flashed with displeasure. She did not think she ever had the “contempt” toward Xu Xiaoshou as Night Guardian had said.</p><p>But when Night Guardian’s words came out and he placed Xu Xiaoshou on the same level as her, she felt that it was ridiculous.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>It was ridiculous!</p><p>“How can a mere junior, a Master (stage), be on the same level as me, Rao Yaoyao?” No matter how much she tried to hide it, this was the thought that emerged in Rao Yaoyao’s mind.</p><p>After that, she was shocked.</p><p>“Yi, to a certain extent, was on the same level as me. However, he had died in the hands of Xu Xiaoshou…” Rao Yaoyao seemed to have come to a sudden realization and finally understood the hidden meaning in Night Guardian’s words.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s age and cultivation level were too deceiving.</p><p>This deceiving nature did not mean that if I had realized it, I could overcome it if I wanted to.</p><p>It was that I wanted to overcome it, but it was just my thought that I had overcome it, and it was not in reality.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
