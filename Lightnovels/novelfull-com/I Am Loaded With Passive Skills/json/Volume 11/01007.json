His eyes flickered as he looked back at the sky. He seemed to have seen the battle between the Black Dragon and the Saint just now.</p><p>He sighed, and his heart filled with shock.</p><p>“Elder Sang, Elder Sang, how dare you team up with these existences? I’m afraid they will devour even your bone remains!</p><p>“Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, Eighth Sword Deity… all of them, how can they be easy to deal with?</p><p>“They’ve even directly started a fight with the Holy Divine Palace. How dare you get involved in these things!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian subconsciously figured out his old friend based on his impression of Sang Qiye of the Holy Palace, the Vice Dean of the Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>However, on second thought, his old friend also had a terrifying name.</p><p>“Second-in-command saint servant, Sleeveless!”</p><p>Therefore, Ye Xiaotian fell silent.</p><p>He thought about the time when he got the letter from Elder Sang and the news that the second-in-command saint servant was captured by the Holy Divine Palace during the battle of the White Cave…</p><p>Elder Sang had vanished during the time in the White Cave.</p><p>In the end, the letter clearly said “Yunlun Mountain Range, Saint Origin Crystal”.</p><p>How long had this been planned in advance?</p><p>And in the end, it actually materialized!</p><p>Ye Xiaotian seemed to have vaguely seen the scene of Elder Sang laughing complacently in front of him. The corners of his eyes twitched a little, and he replaced the last sentence of ridicule in his heart.</p><p>“How dare you? How dare you direct this kind of thing? Even if you want to die, you don’t have to play in this manner!”</p><p>However, after coming to the Yunlun Mountain Range and stepping into the center of this whirlpool, it was very difficult for Ye Xiaotian to escape.</p><p>Moreover, this was Elder Sang’s last request. To be honest, Ye Xiaotian did not want to take the initiative to escape.</p><p>“So, where is the Saint Origin Crystal?” Ye Xiaotian guessed.</p><p>He was thinking that since Elder Sang was Saint Servant Sleeveless, Bazhun’an was suspected to be the Chief of Saint Servant, and Bazhun’an seemed to be related to Abyss Island, then Elder Sang should have been the one who masterminded the fight between the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon and Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>Then, as half of his “own people”…</p><p>Elder Sang wanted him to help get the Saint Origin Crystal, so he should have left some clues to help him get the target among all the stowaways faster. The kind that even red-clothed people could not react to.</p><p>But the clues…</p><p>Ye Xiaotian thought and fell into hesitation.</p><p>Were there any?</p><p>Not at all!</p><p>Other than the words “Saint Origin Crystal” mentioned in Elder Sang’s letter, there were no other clues.</p><p>“D*mn it, you don’t even have the most important information. Are you trying to embarrass me?” Ye Xiaotian cursed in his heart.</p><p>He was a decent person, and he was a disciple of the Holy Palace previously. Even if he entered the Yunlun Mountain Range, he had the intention of not exposing himself if he could.</p><p>If he simply revealed his space attributes and searched the entire Yunlun Mountain Range, Rao Yaoyao would probably be able to land a sword on his face in less than three breaths’ time.</p><p>However, that was not the way to look for it…</p><p>If he were late, then he might have to take the risk of being exposed later on to obtain the Saint Origin Crystal that others had discovered in advance.</p><p>“D*mn it!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian cursed again and gritted his teeth. He felt that no matter what, he could not easily let go of Elder Sang’s last request.</p><p>He waved his hand in the air and the space turned into a mirror. Light began to flow.</p><p>However, at this moment…</p><p>“Whoosh.”</p><p>A light sound of air being torn interrupted Ye Xiaotian’s movements.</p><p>He turned his head and saw from afar, a crystal clear glittering hexagonal crystal of the size of a fist, emitting a faint holy light, and flying toward him.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was puzzled.</p><p>I did not need to look for it, did I?</p><p>Did it look for me instead?</p><p>Soon, he recovered from his dazed state because there was an anxious cry of a human following closely behind the hexagonal crystal.</p><p>“Stop him!”</p><p>“D*mn it, this is a Holy Power treasure worth 100,000 points. Brothers, let’s charge! Eh…is there someone at the front?”</p><p>“Hey! The shorty in front, help me stop this treasure. Don’t submit it, I’ll give you 50,000 points!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
