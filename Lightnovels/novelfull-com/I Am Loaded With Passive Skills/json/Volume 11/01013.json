I need your help.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er turned around and said, “No.”</p><p>“Really?” Xu Xiaoshou still didn’t believe it. Yuan Mansion World had such a huge life force, and even the Bodhi Ancient Wood had a chance of being cultivated. Couldn’t Lei Xi’er take a few more breaths and change back to her junior sister’s appearance?</p><p>Xi’er seemed to know what he was thinking, and the corner of her mouth curled up. She quickly regained her calm expression and said in an ethereal voice, “Can you turn smaller by taking a few more breaths of vitality and spiritual energy?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou choked. Indeed, she couldn’t.</p><p>“I can’t either,” Lei Xi’er immediately released the small wooden pot. The small wooden pot turned into wood-type energy and retracted back into her body. “This is my normal appearance. What you saw before was an anomaly.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fell silent.</p><p>If she couldn’t, then half of his thoughts would have gone down the drain.</p><p>“I want to go out,” Lei Xi’er walked in front of Xu Xiaoshou and looked straight into his eyes. Her words were clear.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could faintly smell the fragrance and said with some difficulty, “It’s still very dangerous outside. Rao Yaoyao should still be making some moves after this. Bazhun’an also just made some moves…”</p><p>“I want to go out,” Lei Xi’er interrupted. Her voice was very soft, but her eyes were full of determination.</p><p>“This…” Xu Xiaoshou hesitated.</p><p>Lei Xi’er tucked her silver hair behind her ear and looked to the other side. “I’m not Greedy the Cat Spirit, and I’m not your pet. You have no reason to keep me here all the time.”</p><p>She paused and swallowed the last part of her sentence, “This place is very boring.” She did not say it out loud.</p><p>Not far away, Greedy the Cat Spirit, who was eavesdropping on the conversation between the two of them, was frightened and immediately lowered his ears. With a meow, he busied himself with conducting alchemy again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly realized what his problem was.</p><p>He was indeed worried about the safety of his junior sister, but he had neglected the personal freedom that Lei Xi’er had as a person.</p><p>Who would want to be locked up by someone else?</p><p>In the past, Xu Xiaoshou could use danger as an excuse to temporarily lock up his junior sister and the others whom he thought were important in the Yuan Mansion World to tide over the dangerous period.</p><p>But that was because, at that time, his junior sister was indeed still weak, and she didn’t dare to refute his words.</p><p>Now, his junior sister’s strength had increased, and her name had also changed.</p><p>She was the Sovereign (stage), and she had the White Cave of the bounded domain, the God Devil Eyes, and other mysterious and special abilities.</p><p>In terms of combat strength, if he was caught off guard, he might not even be a match for her as long as he was controlled.</p><p>What other reason did he have to keep her locked up in the Yuan Mansion?</p><p>Lei Xi’er was not canary.</p><p>The Yuan Mansion world was not her cage either…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of a point that he had deliberately overlooked in the past.</p><p>He wanted to keep his junior sister by his side, and from the looks of it now, it was purely being selfish.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said guiltily. Suddenly, a spiritual light flashed in his mind, and he had a new idea.</p><p>His original intention was that if Lei Xi’er could change back to her junior sister’s appearance, she could replace his identity as “Mu Zixi” in the Yunlun Mountain Range… well, this was her identity, to begin with.</p><p>No matter what, as long as Lei Xi’er could change back, even if it was just her appearance and not personality, Xu Xiaoshou could still free up his hands.</p><p>He could either become “Young Master Xu” or transform into “Saint Servant, Xu Xiaoshou”.</p><p>In short, his combat strength would be freed, and he could complete his next move better.</p><p>He had initially thought that if Lei Xi’er couldn’t change back, his plan would be aborted. But now Xu Xiaoshou suddenly realized that he didn’t need a real person to replace Mu Zixi.</p><p>With so many important things happening, Rao Yaoyao didn’t have time to pay attention to Mu Zixi.</p><p>In such a situation, he could use a clone to cover her tracks, but he…</p><p>No!</p><p>Not only him, but Lei Xi’er could also leave the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>Her combat strength was very strong now, and she might not be able to fight against Yi in a one-on-one fight. However, her God Devil Eyes could even control Yi. Wouldn’t it be easy for her to deal with other people?</p><p>If the portrait clone was used as a cover, and the Saint Servant, Xu Xiaoshou, and the descendant of the Lei family, Lei Xi’er, were summoned in the Yunlun Mountain Range…</p><p>This strongest combination of the younger generation, not to mention the stowaways of the Higher Void (level)…</p><p>But at least, most of the Sovereign (stage) and Cutting Path (stage) experts were unable to withstand it!</p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Xiaoshou expression changed and he said, “I can let you out of the Yuan Mansion, but for the sake of my junior sister’s safety, you have to agree to a condition.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
