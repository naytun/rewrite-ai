It was the spitting image of Mu Zixi. It was able to walk and speak eloquently like a real human.</p><p>At this moment, in the Yunlun Mountain Range, on the mountain road leading to the Nine Dragon Range, there was a young girl in a green dress with twintails running in.</p><p>Suddenly, she stopped.</p><p>It was as if she was stuck in a frame. Under this subtle detail, Xu Xiaoshou’s body was swamped with the portrait clone.</p><p>The portrait clone continued to move forward on the mountain road, but it slightly changed its direction.</p><p>The original one escaped into the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>When his original body returned to the Yuan Mansion World, Xu Xiaoshou no longer disguised himself.</p><p>With a shake of his body, he returned to the appearance that ‘Xu Xiaoshou’ should have. He was extraordinarily handsome. He also had a slender and well-proportioned body.</p><p>This time, he didn’t even bother to hide his shining treasured body anymore, and he completely revealed his magnificence.</p><p>He didn’t belong to the saint servant, Xu Xiaoshou, who had been hiding his head and tail in the past.</p><p>He didn’t belong to the ordinary-looking Xu Deye of the first pavilion in the sky.</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou was just Xu Xiaoshou. He didn’t have any prefix at all!</p><p>“So comfortable…”</p><p>After maintaining the ‘Transformation’ for a long time and using the ‘Imitator’ to imitate others, Xu Xiaoshou felt that the world had become much cooler when he returned to his original self.</p><p>Lei Xi’er looked at the person who had appeared in the image of “Mu Zixi”. Then, that person shook his body and transformed back into the familiar but slightly different “Eldest Senior Brother”. When Lei Xi’er saw that, her thoughts suddenly went blank.</p><p>She smiled as brilliant as a blooming flower. Then, she stretched out her hand and gestured at the person in front of her. With a tap of her toes, she blurted out, “You’ve grown taller?”</p><p>This voice no longer had the charm that was unique to Lei Xi’er’s voice. Instead, it was like a junior sister from the past. Lei Xi’er had not seen this familiar person for a long time. She was stunned that he became taller, and his look had changed a lot.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned when he heard this.</p><p>She had a gentle action and soft tone that only a junior sister had.</p><p>Lei Xi’er was…</p><p>Before he could think further, the silver-haired woman in front of him quickly withdrew her hand after saying that. She looked sideways and her face was slightly red.</p><p>“Hmm?” Xu Xiaoshou instantly understood something. He scratched his head and said with a silly smile, “It should be. There were some changes when I broke through to the Sovereign Physique the last time.”</p><p>As he spoke, he lowered his head and realized why he felt so cool.</p><p>It turned out that the green dress that belonged to his junior sister had been shortened by him. Now, he was a big guy in cross-dressing!</p><p>“I’ll go out first. When the spatial passageway appears later, you can just leave the Yuan Mansion.” the silver-haired woman said to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also had an awkward look on his face. He hurriedly used the Vanishing Technique to change his clothes. He then flashed out of the Yuan Mansion and rushed back to the Yunlun Mountain Range. He split way with the portrait clone, Mu Zixi, and headed straight for the nine Dragon Range.</p><p>In the Yuan Mansion World, after losing Xu Xiaoshou and Greedy the Cat Spirit, only Lei Xi’er was left alone.</p><p>“How can it be…”</p><p>When they were alone, Lei Xi’er relaxed slightly. She bit her lip and bashfully blamed herself.</p><p>She stared at the hand that she had reached out to indicate Xu Xiaoshou’s height.</p><p>After a long time.</p><p>Lei Xi’er felt that it was this hand that destroyed the image that she wanted to establish in front of Xu Xiaoshou. It was the two different images of “the past me” and “the present me” so that the other party would know their limits.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou was aware of his limits.</p><p>She, on the other hand, would still mess up her limits!</p><p>“D*mn it…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er stretched out her hand, wanting to hit herself, but when her hand reached into the air, her movements naturally changed.</p><p>She squatted down with a face full of resentment. With one hand supporting her cheek. She was upset, and the corners of her eyes were curved downwards. With the other hand on the ground, she unconsciously drew circles in the sand.</p><p>“D*mn it, Xu Xiaoshou, you abandoned me again…”</p><p>With a buzz, a spatial passageway that could allow one person to pass through suddenly appeared in front of her. Following that was Xu Xiaoshou’s voice, “Come out!”</p><p>As if she had just woken up from a dream, Lei Xi’er suddenly raised her eyes and looked at the spatial passageway.</p><p>Her face instantly turned red. It was like blood could drip out from her red face. Even her delicate earlobes had turned completely red.</p><p>Lei Xi’er looked around guiltily. After realizing that there were no other people around, she patted her chest and let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p>However, this action seemed to have triggered some sort of mechanism. Lei Xi’er’s body trembled and she suddenly pouted.</p><p>“What are you rushing me for?”</p><p>After mumbling, she lifted the edge of her skirt and jumped into the spatial passageway.</p><p>“Coming!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
