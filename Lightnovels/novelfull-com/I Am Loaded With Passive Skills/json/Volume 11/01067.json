Xu Xiaoshou had Fourth Sword in his hand and forced her to compete with him in the game of “who could fly the highest”.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was still unable to let go.</p><p>However, even though she had been teased at that time, Rao Yaoyao had never taken Xu Xiaoshou, this young man, to heart.</p><p>Now, with the reminder from Night Guardian and witnessing Xu Xiaoshou’s heroic feat, she could not help but be wary of him. Simultaneously, she was curious.</p><p>“What kind of person can be this nosy?”</p><p>With the overall situation basically settled, Rao Yaoyao was not in a hurry to make a move.</p><p>To her, it seemed that it was more important to clearly see the face of that young man who was extremely capable of causing trouble.</p><p>However, anyone with discerning eyes in the arena could see that what Rao Yaoyao wanted was not just Xu Xiaoshou. She wanted to obtain more!</p><p>On the Lone Cliff that was so quiet that only the howling of the demonic wind could be heard, the female sword deity walked step by step to the edge of the cliff with her sword pointing diagonally. She casually asked the question that had not been answered before.</p><p>“I’ll ask again…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what exactly is the reason that made you dare to wait for me here?”</p><p>He would like to know too… Xu Xiaoshou felt as if Rao Yaoyao was stepping on his heart with every step she took, which made his heart beat even faster.</p><p>Without leaving a trace, he glanced at the Lone Cliff behind him, thinking to himself that he really didn’t want to go down. In his heart, this was the last resort.</p><p>Moreover, there was a Spell Forbidden Barrier at the bottom of the Lone Cliff. He didn’t know who left it behind.</p><p>According to his previous thoughts, Xu Xiaoshou thought that the possibility of Bazhun’an leaving it behind was greater. The sword will that drifted off from the Lone Cliff further proved this point.</p><p>However, what if it wasn’t…</p><p>What should he do if he ended up like Murong Ying, who disappeared or died without any news, after falling down?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he could still mediate with the other party on the cliff.</p><p>Therefore, he reached out his hand toward Rao Yaoyao, who was still ten feet away from him, and gently pushed the air forward.</p><p>“Sword Deity Rao, please have some self-respect. If you continue to move forward, I might not be able to hold myself back.”</p><p>This voice was not loud, but it drifted into the ears of all the law enforcers on the quiet Lone Cliff, causing everyone to be stunned.</p><p>As expected of the slanderous Xu Xiaoshou… The law enforcers could be considered to have personally verified the accuracy of the information.</p><p>“Impressed, passive points + 29.”</p><p>“Detested, passive points + 66.”</p><p>“Guarded, passive points + 103.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was also stunned. Then, she stopped and said with a smile, “Sure, but in exchange, you should answer my last question.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath and raised a finger.</p><p>“First, my name is not Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Before he could finish, his “Perception” saw that not only the law enforcers’ eyes had become stunned, but even his own people, Ye Xiaotian and Lei Xi’er, subconsciously tilted their heads and looked at him strangely.</p><p>The Greedy the Cat Spirit on top of his head suddenly stretched out two front paws and covered its face.</p><p>“How is it that a cat like you have expressions too…” Xu Xiaoshou thought while he was driven mad in his heart. However, on the outside, he kept his composure and said calmly, “My surname is actually Wen. My name is Wen Ming.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao did not expect that Xu Xiaoshou would still try to wear a fake identity when his death was imminent… No, he even brought out a name that she had never heard of before!</p><p>“If your name isn’t Xu Xiaoshou, then you… ” Rao Yaoyao looked at the short white-haired youth beside Xu Xiaoshou expressionlessly. “You… aren’t called Ye Xiaotian too?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian glanced sideways at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He felt that there was nothing he could do to get Xu Xiaoshou out of this situation, but perhaps the saint servant, Xu Xiaoshou, had a way.</p><p>Was he stalling for time now?</p><p>Waiting for backup?</p><p>Would there even be backup?</p><p>That couldn’t be right…</p><p>No matter what, Ye Xiaotian felt that he should cooperate with Xu Xiaoshou and try to keep up with him. There was no logic to it, but there might be some deep-seated and meaningless actions.</p><p>At that moment, Ye Xiaotian nodded slightly. “Yes, I am Zhou Shen.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned his eyes, his face full of shock.</p><p>Zhou Shen?</p><p>Zhou Tianshen?</p><p>“Dean, you are even more ridiculous than me!” Xu Xiaoshou thought.</p><p>On the mountain by the cliff, more than a hundred law enforcers also turned their eyes at the same time, staring at Ye Xiaotian. At this moment, everyone’s faces were filled with ridicule.</p><p>Before the operation, they had already learned that Rao Yaoyao had received the report that Ye Xiaotian had resigned from Tiansang Spirit Palace, and his whereabouts were currently unknown.</p><p>There were only a few experts with space attributes on the continent.</p><p>If this could not be matched, the intelligence of the law enforcers could be fed to the dogs.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
