Then, he turned into a mortal and fell rapidly.</p><p>“What special existence is at the bottom of the cliff?”</p><p>“That dazzling light earlier… can seal all the power of a cutting path?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou furrowed his brows as he speculated. He stared fixedly at the sea of clouds on the cliff.</p><p>He suddenly thought of something and looked at Ye Xiaotian. “Headmaster, how did you know that this cliff was dangerous?”</p><p>“I tested it before…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian bent down and picked up a stone before throwing it at the sea of clouds.</p><p>The stone did not cause any abnormalities. It fell downwards, pulled by gravity naturally.</p><p>However, at this moment, a mysterious aura was emitted from the bottom of the cliff. It was like a call that possessed a seductive allure.</p><p>...</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart palpitated. He realized that at that time, it was not that the headmaster did not know Murong Ying wanted to chase after the battle communicator. The headmaster knew that Murong Ying wasn’t trying to ambush him.</p><p>He knew!</p><p>But he just wanted to use Murong Ying to verify his thoughts!</p><p>What a sly person… Xu Xiaoshou was secretly speechless, but on the surface, he said with great respect, “Headmaster, if you didn’t stop me, I might really try to stop Murong Ying and rush towards the sea of clouds… that would be dangerous!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian nodded indifferently and continued to look at the sea of clouds. After a long time, his eyes lit up and he said with a slight frown, “I don’t know what exactly is going on at the bottom of the cliff, but that dazzling light just now made me think of a possibility…”</p><p>“What possibility?” Xu Xiaoshou immediately looked back.</p><p>“Spell Forbidden Barrier!” Ye Xiaotian said solemnly, enunciating each word with a pause.</p><p>Spell Forbidden Barrier…</p><p>What was that?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lowered his head with a confused look and continued to stare at the headmaster.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian slowly floated in the air. After he was as tall as Xu Xiaoshou, he said with a solemn expression.</p><p>“I’ve never seen a Spell Forbidden Barrier before. This is only a possibility, so it doesn’t rule out the chance that my speculation could be wrong…”</p><p>He paused for a moment before continuing.</p><p>“That dazzling explosion just now made even a law enforcer at the cutting path level unable to resist at all. This is somewhat similar to the information I learned through a few words in the past, and it reminds me of the Spell Forbidden Barrier.”</p><p>“Mm… The reason I know all this is because of your Elder Qiao.”</p><p>Elder Qiao?</p><p>The Chief Elder of Tiansang Spirit Palace’s Spiritual Affairs Division, Qiao Qianzhi? It had been a long time since he last met the elder..</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt nostalgic as some boisterous laughter echoed in his mind.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian did not pause and continued.</p><p>“Spell Forbidden Barrier, a saint-level array!”</p><p>“Your Elder Qiao once said that the most powerful array is this ‘Spell Forbidden Barrier’. It can completely seal all the abilities of a spiritual cultivator, turning them into a weak mortal who is completely powerless.</p><p>“This includes… includes demi-saint!”</p><p>Even Ye Xiaotian himself couldn’t believe what he had just said.</p><p>A saint-level array…</p><p>An array that was capable of sealing the abilities of all spiritual cultivators, including demi-saint?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts were pulled away from his memories. He was so shocked by this information that his scalp went numb.</p><p>How was that possible?</p><p>Demi-saint had already surpassed the realm of a spiritual cultivator, right?</p><p>They grasped the ‘holy path’ and not the ‘way of the heavens’. Even if the ‘Spell Forbidden Barrier’ was a saint-level array, how could it be so powerful?</p><p>Didn’t this mean that even if Dao Qiongcang came to this place, he would be completely sealed off and become an ant that was at the mercy of others?</p><p>“Headmaster, are you joking?” Xu Xiaoshou was silent for a moment before he said this jokingly.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian shook his head slightly.</p><p>“These are Elder Qiao’s exact words.”</p><p>“I haven’t verified it which is why I said that this is only a possibility…”</p><p>“The array at the bottom of the cliff might not be that legendary ‘Spell Forbidden Barrier’. After all, even your Elder Qiao only know that this array exists in three places on the continent.”</p><p>“Which three places?” Xu Xiaoshou felt like an extremely curious baby.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian muttered to himself as if he was hesitating on whether to answer.</p><p>After he swept a glance at Xu Xiaoshou who was in front of him, he felt the boundless power contained within this kid’s body. He recalled that Xu Xiaoshou had once saved him, and his strength had long since changed.</p><p>It could be said that the current Xu Xiaoshou already possessed the basic qualifications to come into contact with this world’s top secrets.</p><p>Moreover, after coming into contact with these secrets, he would have the strength to protect himself.</p><p>Thus, Ye Xiaotian slowly said, “The ‘Shengxuan Gate’ of the Holy Palace, the ‘Dead Sea’ of the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, and Abyss Island… in other words, it’s the ‘Sky City’ in the eyes of the world.”</p><p>“Sky City?” Xu Xiaoshou was slightly stunned.</p><p>Initially, he did not think much of the ‘Spell Forbidden Barrier’. However, when he was told that it was related to the Holy Palace, the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, and Abyss Island, he immediately felt that it was high and mighty.</p><p>“I’ve heard of the ‘Shengxuan Gate’ of the Holy Palace. The ‘Tianxuan Gate’ of the Tiansang Spirit Palace seems to be an imitation of its existence, just like the ‘Goose Lake’ of the Spirit Palace and the ‘Greater Goose Lake’ of the Holy Palace?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“Yes.” Ye Xiaotian nodded.</p><p>“But what’s the Dead Sea?” Xu Xiaoshou asked again.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian smirked when he heard that and said indifferently, “Your master’s current home.”</p><p>“My master… Elder Sang…” Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment and had a strange expression. “Home?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian regained his seriousness and nodded. “The Dead Sea is located under the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe and is also known as the Sacred Mountain Prison by the world. Of course, very few people know the true name of the Sacred Mountain Prison, the Dead Sea.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou went quiet.</p><p>That was the Sacred Mountain Prison!</p><p>“No matter what, Elder Sang was still your old friend. Headmaster, how can you use such a mocking tone to talk about Elder sang? Do you have any humanity left?!” Xu Xiaoshou silently thought.</p><p>He was speechless for a moment.</p><p>Soon, he realized that the reason for the ‘Dead Sea’ to have a ‘Spell Forbidden Barrier’ was probably to seal the spiritual cultivators in the Sacred Mountain Prison.</p><p>However, why did the ‘Shengxuan Gate’ of the Holy Palace also have a ‘Spell Forbidden Barrier’?</p><p>Did it have a similar existence to the Dead Sea?</p><p>Could it be that the Holy Palace also need to seal something, or… a person?</p><p>And…</p><p>“Headmaster, how did you know that Abyss Island also has a ‘Spell Forbidden Barrier’?” Xu Xiaoshou thought of this and was very curious.</p><p>That was the Sky City. The world only heard of it, but it was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>How could the headmaster know so much about it? Could it be that he had been there before?</p><p>As if he had understood the thoughts behind Xu Xiaoshou’s question, Ye Xiaotian laughed, “I have never set foot on Abyss Island before, but your master, Elder Sang, has been there before. Aje was brought out by him, and he was the one who told Elder Qiao about the ‘Spell Forbidden Barrier’ there.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly recalled that when he brought Aje out of the Tianxuan Gate, Elder Qiao had indeed told him about Aje’s origins. It was Elder sang who brought Aje out.</p><p>The chief of the saint servant was Bazhun’an and Elder Sang was the second-in-command. He was also the master of the black and white veins of the inner island of Abyss Island.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was convinced now!</p><p>Even though he took a huge detour…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally understood why the little Tiansang Spirit Palace had the first generation of divine puppets.</p><p>When they were talking about Aje, Ye Xiaotian suddenly smiled and said,</p><p>“It’s a coincidence that just when I got the saint origin crystal, Elder Qiao’s research on the divine puppets had a major breakthrough, and he needed the item.”</p><p>“After I gave him the saint origin crystal, he specifically told me to bring Aje back to the Spirit Palace if I ran into you in Yunlun mountain range.”</p><p>“I was thinking about how I should find you or get into contact with you. Little did I expect you to find me and even had a clash with me…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian sighed.</p><p>This coincidence was way too coincidental!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t understand. The Dean wanted to bring Aje back?</p><p>“What for?” He subconsciously wanted to touch his chest, but he immediately stopped himself from doing so.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian calmly said, “To do research.”</p><p>“Research?” Xu Xiaoshou instinctively resisted. “The research you mentioned, is it dangerous?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian narrowed his eyes. He keenly sensed that Xu Xiaoshou’s words sounded rather distant.</p><p>Previously, Xu Xiaoshou had used the term “headmaster” to refer to him, but this time, he used the word “you” directly…</p><p>“I can only tell you that there is no research that is not dangerous.” Ye Xiaotian still chose to be frank.</p><p>“Then I refuse.” Xu Xiaoshou took half a step back and blurted out without the slightest hesitation.</p><p>When he brought Aje out of the Tianxuan Gate, he had already promised to bring it out to see the colorful world outside and experience happiness.</p><p>And Aje chose to come out with him because of trust.</p><p>Both sides had already established an intimate relationship in the numerous life-and-death crises.</p><p>To Xu Xiaoshou, Aje was a guardian that had high combat strength. Although it could protect his safety, it was also a baby that did not know the affairs of the world. It needed to be cared for. How could it go back for a so-called “research”?</p><p>Aje was Aje, not a lab rat!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
