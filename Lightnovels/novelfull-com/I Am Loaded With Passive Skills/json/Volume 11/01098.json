Only then did he calmly turn off the saint statue.</p><p>“If I don’t come out now, are you, Teng Shanhai, going to kill my disciple here?” Mu Ling said emotionlessly.</p><p>At this time, Teng Shanhai already knew that the situation was over, and there was nothing he could do.</p><p>“I don’t dare.” He let out a long sigh.</p><p>Bai Lian rolled his eyes from behind and said in a low voice, “Supreme Master, he can’t kill me.”</p><p>Mu Ling snorted coldly and turned his head, “Carelessness could get both sovereigns and higher voids killed by someone at the dao realm, let alone a mere cutting path like you?”</p><p>Bai Lian’s face turned red, and he didn’t dare to say anything more.</p><p>Teng Shanhai didn’t have time to listen to this master-disciple nonsense.</p><p>Since Mu Ling had appeared, although he wasn’t sure of the situation, he knew that only by telling the whole story could the ancient swordsman not affect the battle.</p><p>However, just as he wanted to say something, Mu Ling waved his hand, “No need to say anything more. The power of the internal world of the Divine World won’t be affected by that kid’s breakthrough. If the situation changes, I can take action and stop the power of both sides.”</p><p>A barely noticeable look of surprise flashed across Bai Lian’s eyes. He did not understand what was going on.</p><p>What was going on with Supreme Master? Was he planning to help the Holy Divine Palace?</p><p>Teng Shanhai was both surprised and delighted when he heard this.</p><p>He was shocked that Mu Ling, a battle-type fire user who knew nothing about the art of Divine Secret, actually had a special method that could affect the Divine Path Principles?</p><p>He was delighted that since Mu Ling dared to make such a claim, everything would be guaranteed. He no longer had to fear that the swordsman’s breakthrough would affect Rao Yaoyao’s plans.</p><p>Both sides suddenly fell silent.</p><p>The only sound left in the air was the sword cries.</p><p>After a short interlude, Gu Qinger’s breakthrough had clearly come to an end.</p><p>Mu Ling’s control over the saint statue was extremely strong. It did not affect the progress of this trial-taker’s breakthrough in the slightest.</p><p>Not long after, the power of the golden sea of swords on the Lone Cliff stabilized. Under the gazes of everyone present, the figure floating in the middle swayed slightly, as if he had recovered from his epiphany.</p><p>“Hahahaha!”</p><p>The first to ring out was the same arrogant laughter, followed by a few sounds of joy.</p><p>“Gu Qingsan, you’re finished. I’ll beat you to the ground and make you beg for mercy!”</p><p>“Gu Qingyi, just you wait. As long as you dare to come back, I’ll definitely let you have a taste of the Ten Thousand Sword Technique!”</p><p>“And you, Wen… Cough Cough!”</p><p>Gu Qinger was bathed in golden color. Before he could even open his eyes, he had already spoken arrogantly.</p><p>At the end of his words, he suddenly coughed twice and stopped acting arrogant.</p><p>Feeling the large amount of knowledge he had absorbed from the Great Path of the sword in his mind, Gu Qinger had already come to a realization that he had broken through the first stage of the technique.</p><p>He stretched out his hand.</p><p>“Swish swish swish…”</p><p>Out of the 129,600 golden swords, only the nine spiritual swords with corporeal forms flew back to the sword wheel on his back.</p><p>After doing all of this, Gu Qinger opened his eyes. Sword Will shot out from his eyes, tearing apart the ground and space on the Lone Cliff as he looked disdainfully in all directions.</p><p>Then, when his gaze returned to focus…</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>Gu Qinger froze on the spot!</p><p>In his memory, there was no one on the Lone Cliff before the short breakthrough.</p><p>However, when he opened his eyes, there were more than ten figures not far away… those fellows with extraordinary aura were sizing him up with a mocking gaze.</p><p>“???”</p><p>The look of confusion was not only owned by the dozen or so people on the opposite side, Gu Qinger had it too.</p><p>He stared at the other side in confusion for a long time. Finally, his face turned from red with ecstasy to red with embarrassment.</p><p>Someone was here?</p><p>Why didn’t he sense them at all?</p><p>When did these guys arrive? They should have appeared after he said the last sentence, right? They definitely couldn’t have been here from the beginning to the end, right?”</p><p>“Little guy…”</p><p>Before Teng Shanhai could say anything, Mu Ling had already taken a step forward. He tried his best to put on a gentle face and asked amiably, “Did you have any accidents during your breakthrough?”</p><p>No matter how hard he tried to put on an expression, his high cheekbones, deep eye sockets, and gloomy face without eyebrows would only look like a dead corpse suddenly coming to life. It was extremely frightening.</p><p>Bai Lian, who was at the side, suddenly shivered. He was shocked by his supreme master’s face.</p><p>He immediately realized what his supreme master was planning…</p><p>Bai Lian wasn’t the only one. Everyone present was shocked by the expression Mu Ling had after his ‘effort’ of making himself seem gentler. However, from their point of view, it wasn’t a problem for Mu Ling to show some concern for the younger generation.</p><p>Whereas, when Gu Qinger saw the expressions and reactions of these people, all of them seemed to be extremely shocked.</p><p>That guy in black with no eyebrows asked him about his progress… what did he mean by that?</p><p>“What does my breakthrough have to do with you?” He thought.</p><p>Gu Qinger looked at the gloomy face in front of him and was so scared that he almost ran away.</p><p>However, he remembered that he had made a breakthrough in the way of the sword. These people in front of him looked like they had high cultivation levels and were wearing strange clothes. They didn’t look like good people, so they were perfect for him to test his new technique on.</p><p>Gu Qinger had met the law enforcers.</p><p>The law enforcers were all wearing black robes and big hoods. Each of them had an extremely clear and righteous image.</p><p>However, the people standing in front of him were a pretentious old man in a Daoist robe, a weird old lady in hemp clothes, a muscular man with a fierce face, a one-eyed man in armor, and a browless monster that looked like a corpse…</p><p>How could these people be good guys?</p><p>Thinking that they were a group of stowaways and that they might have witnessed his “venting” just now, Gu Qinger was both embarrassed and angry.</p><p>He raised his hands, and nine swords flew out from the sword wheel.</p><p>Teng Shanhai’s heart clenched, and he realized that Mu Ling’s appearance had scared the young man, so he hurriedly said, “Wait…”</p><p>At the same time, Mu Ling, who was in front of him, also reached out his hand and said, “Hold on, young man, we are not bad guys. You can’t attack us!”</p><p>…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
