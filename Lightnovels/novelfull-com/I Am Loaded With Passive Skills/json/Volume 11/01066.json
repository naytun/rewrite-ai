(3)</h1><p>Chapter 1066: Senior Rao, Save Me… (3)</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was under a great deal of pressure, her lips and teeth trembled. She didn’t dare to look directly at the person opposite her, so she could only avert her gaze.</p><p>“I’ll speak.”</p><p>“Then speak!” Bai Lian waved his hand.</p><p>“There’s… A small problem here. It’s that… a portion of the Cloud Realm World’s power was used to locate the stowaway, and as a result, it neglected… erm, the trial-takers…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen could not believe how she had said that. Her face was flushed red. After she regained her senses, she added,”… safety.”</p><p>“A portion?” Bai Lian raised his right eyebrow and asked.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen curled her fingers into her palm. She felt the pressure that only when one was facing a supreme master would feel. Although it was obvious that Bai Lian was trying his best to appear friendly…</p><p>However, there was indeed something wrong with what she said just now.</p><p>That so-called “portion” was too exaggerated!</p><p>If one was to really think about it, it was the fact that almost seventy percent of the image on the spirit mirror was used to locate the stowaway. The remaining “portion” belonged to the trial-takers and was placed in an inconspicuous corner.</p><p>“A portion…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen said hesitantly, “Well, actually it’s a portion… uh, that was used to locate the trial-takers… but this is just a coincidence, j-just…”</p><p>She originally wanted to say, “Just when you guys came over, the spirit mirror image was cut away.”.</p><p>But looking at Bai Lian’s half-smiling expression, Yu Zhiwen decisively stopped speaking.</p><p>The other party was not a fool. If she dared to say this, he would have the intention to beat her up.</p><p>.....</p><p>“I made a serious mistake. I will definitely correct it!” Yu Zhiwen raised her hand to take an oath.</p><p>“It’s not your fault. If it wasn’t for Rao Yaoyao’s request, you wouldn’t dare to do this.” Bai Lian naturally would not make things difficult for the little girl and gave her a way out.</p><p>However, after that, he changed the topic. “But a mistake is still a mistake. Since I’ve seen it as an emissary of the Holy Palace, I have no choice but to report it…”</p><p>Speaking up to this point, Bai Lian paused.</p><p>He originally wanted to say, “Report it up.”</p><p>This was because his Supreme Master, Mu Ling, was right behind him. Bai Lian would unconsciously lower his attitude and treat his Supreme Master with the same kind of service and respect as before.</p><p>However, on second thought, even if he reported it up, the current Supreme Master Mu Ling wouldn’t pay attention to these small matters.</p><p>It was more likely that after the information was reported to the Holy Palace, he would have to wait until he returned to the Holy Palace to deal with it. That would be really troublesome!</p><p>Hence, Bai Lian paused and laughed, “I can solve it now.”</p><p>“How are you planning to solve it?” Yu Zhiwen was trembling with fear.</p><p>Bai Lian glanced at his Supreme Master, Mu Ling, from the corner of his eye. Seeing that there was no reaction, he told her about the true purpose of this trip, “Yu Zhiwen, right? I forgot to mention this. Please send my regards to Dao Xuanji on behalf of my Supreme Master and me.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was stunned. She did not understand, but she promised, “I will definitely pass on your regards.”</p><p>So what happened after that?</p><p>Her gaze was still filled with doubt.</p><p>Bai Lian continued, “There is something that I might need your help with… Do take note that this is not a request or a mission. It is just a personal request of mine.”</p><p>“I won’t dare to treat the task as such. Senior, please speak.” Yu Zhiwen immediately bent down, but she did not immediately agree. She could hear the “terrifying” tone in his voice.</p><p>Bai Lian smiled, “It’s not anything particularly difficult. It’s just that some time ago, our Holy Palace wanted a person from your Holy Divine Palace, but until now, the person hasn’t been given to us yet. Therefore, I would like to ask you to speak to your Supreme Master and do me a favor by giving that person to me.”</p><p>“Don’t worry!” Without waiting for the other party to react, Bai Lian immediately continued, “I, Bai Lian, will definitely remember this favor to you and your supreme master, Dao Xuanji.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s scalp went numb when she heard this. Who could make Bai Lian owe two favors at the same time?</p><p>“Who does senior want?” She asked.</p><p>“Saint servant, Sleeveless!” Bai Lian sneaked a glance at the people behind him. Seeing that his supreme master still had no reaction, he said passionately, “The traitorous disciple of the Holy Palace will have to be dealt with by the Holy Palace itself!”</p><p>The atmosphere suddenly turned cold.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen trembled slightly. She felt that there was an additional deathly stillness in this space, which made people shiver.</p><p>Bai Lian’s performance was even worse. His body trembled violently, and he did not dare to look back at his supreme master at all. He only coughed lightly and said, “Cough, hmm… there’s only this small matter, nothing else.”</p><p>Small matter… Yu Zhiwen thought to herself that this was a huge matter! How could anyone in the Dead Sea be taken out just because of a single word from her Supreme Master?</p><p>“I can only say that I’ll try my best to help say a few words…” She was full of hesitation. She could not refuse, but she also could not directly agree.</p><p>“Thank you for your hard work. Regardless of whether this matter succeeds or not, I will definitely remember your contribution,” Bai Lian said with a chuckle. Then, he turned around and waved his hand, preparing to leave, “Don’t worry, I will not talk about the Spirit Mirror’s image… Yes, with the higher-ups of our Holy Palace.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen stayed quiet.</p><p>She did not dare to say anything more. She watched Bai Lian turn around and leave with Elder Mu Ling, who had not said a word from the beginning.</p><p>Suddenly, Mu Ling’s footsteps stopped, and he turned around.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s heart stopped beating. That dark and cold face without eyebrows stared at her until her entire body trembled.</p><p>“Elder?”</p><p>“Turn off the spirit mirror image of Lone Cliff.”</p><p>Mu Ling’s low and unquestionable voice sounded. After a pause, he looked at Yu Zhiwen, who was so nervous that she didn’t dare to move. His voice became gentler, but it was still rather distant and cold.</p><p>“Protect your eyes well.”</p><p>With that, he turned around and left.</p><p>“What did he mean by protecting my eyes well?” She thought.</p><p>“Was he implying that the battle that would take place at the Lone Cliff would damage my Pearl Gem Star Eyes, which would be watching it through the spirit mirror?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen didn’t dare to resist, so she could only do as she was told and turn off the spirit mirror of the Lone Cliff.</p><p>After doing that, she turned around and saw Bai Lian summoning a special spirit telepathy array and then a majestic crane.</p><p>Then, Bai Lian led the crane, and Mu Ling leaped onto the crane’s back.</p><p>The two of them and the crane rode the clouds to the north.</p><p>“Sigh.”</p><p>It was not until then did Yu Zhiwen feel completely relieved and exhausted.</p><p>So this trip was actually requested by Elder Mu Ling, but some trivial matters had to be handed over to someone else. Therefore, his disciple, Bai Lian, put down all the work in the Holy Palace and acted as the crane guide?</p><p>“The infernal lineage is indeed terrifying…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen looked back at the spirit mirror that had already been turned off and suddenly felt very curious.</p><p>What would happen at Lone Cliff next?</p><p>According to the inheritance, Sword Deity Rao’s main target, Xu Xiaoshou, should be Elder Mu Ling’s martial nephew, right?</p><p>Then, would the Holy Palace… choose to be partial?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
