He paused for a long time as if he was hesitating on how to say it.</p><p>He did not notice the small movements from his team member Wang Chao. Murong Ying brought a sovereign here not as a help, but to warn him about something.</p><p>“Wang Chao, I have some heartfelt words to say to you…” Despite being hidden in the dark, when Murong Ying spoke, he still appeared somewhat guilty and lacking in confidence.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou secretly frowned, he could hear a different tone.</p><p>Based on Murong Ying’s performance, this guy might not have the evil intention of killing people to silence them.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to let down his guard. He was afraid that the other party was intentionally showing weakness to their enemy. So, he said with a slightly pained tone, like Wang Chao.</p><p>“Brother Murong, there are only the two of us now. If you have anything to say, just say it. It’s just that… your stuttering manner actually makes me very uncomfortable. Could it be that I, Wang Chao, have done something to let you down?”</p><p>“Eh? That’s not true!” Murong Ying rubbed his hands together and chuckled. At the same time that he did something that made Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes pop out of their sockets, he leaned over and said, “Just about what happened earlier, weren’t we both watching the battle under a big rock?”</p><p>“Yeah?” Xu Xiaoshou nodded. “What’s the big deal?”</p><p>“Of course, it’s big deal!” Murong Ying’s voice became louder as he sneered. “You haven’t become a team leader yet. I wonder how high Sword Deity Rao’s requirements for the team leaders are. If…”</p><p>He stopped for a moment and looked around. When he saw that there was indeed no one around, he lowered his tone and said again.</p><p>“If Sword Deity Rao finds out that the two of us have stayed under that big rock for so long and only informed the higher-ups when the battle situation has changed, then something bad will happen! This can already be considered as hindering military operation and opportunity!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked by these words.</p><p>He looked at Murong Ying with a face full of shock.</p><p>He thought silently, “Look at our current situation. Captain, how can you say this to me at such a time? Aren’t we on the road of pursuing the enemy?”</p><p>The most urgent matter at hand was to take down the enemy as much as they possibly could. How could they waste their time on such a trivial matter?</p><p>So, Murong Ying was such a captain…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s worldview was refreshed in an instant. He immediately let down his guard and felt that there was no need to unsheathe the Fourth Sword.</p><p>“Speak!” Murong Ying saw that Wang Chao did not speak for a long time and urged him anxiously.</p><p>The corner of Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth twitched. He knew that at this time, he should make the situation less awkward for Murong Ying. Thus, he said righteously,</p><p>“Captain, what are you saying? The reason why we were waiting there was that we felt that we have the confidence to defeat him with just a small team!”</p><p>“After that, the Eighth Sword Deity appeared, followed by Yama’s Huang Quan. These were all unexpected circumstances, even if…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paused for a moment, he continued, “Even if the captain hesitated for a moment before issuing the highest alarm, that was understandable. After all, at that time, even my thoughts had stopped. Captain, it was not easy for you to still issue the alarm!”</p><p>When Murong Ying heard what he wanted, he finally let out a sigh of relief. Soon, his face turned serious and he said, “This is what I wanted to tell you.”</p><p>“Which one?” Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. What did he say just now? It was all flattery, nothing important…</p><p>“Delay communication!”</p><p>Murong Ying said heavily, “You saw it too. The two of us had delayed the communication for some time, which caused Sword Deity Rao to not be able to rush over at the first moment. Thus, the boss of Yama and the Eighth Sword Deity escaped. This has happened before, and it was a big one. If we were to be discovered later…”</p><p>As he spoke, he stopped, his face filled with palpitations.</p><p>“You were clearly the one who delayed the communication, not the two of us. My channel was a one-way battle channel…” Xu Xiaoshou silently ridiculed in his heart, and then said, “How could this be discovered?”</p><p>His face was filled with disapproval.</p><p>At that time, Murong Ying was indeed mentally deranged, but the delay was not long. The crucial matter had already passed, so how could Rao Yaoyao be concerned about such trivial matters?</p><p>“You’ve underestimated Sword Deity Rao’s ability. It’s possible for her to use means and go back in time or something!” Murong Ying was worried.</p><p>Go back in time? Did Rao Yaoyao know how to go back in time… Xu Xiaoshou had a hesitant look on his face. He did not think that Rao Yaoyao had mastered such an ability. After all, her main focus was the emotion sword technique.</p><p>Murong Ying saw Wang Chao’s disbelief, he laughed coldly and said, “This matter concerns the Saint Servant and the boss of Yama. In the end, there will definitely be a huge problem. So even if Sword Deity Rao doesn’t know how to control the power of time, the headquarters will still send people to go back in time.”</p><p>With such an explanation… Xu Xiaoshou immediately understood.</p><p>At this moment, Murong Ying lowered his head again. He rubbed his hands and said, “This is it. This is what I want to talk to you about…”</p><p>His voice suddenly stopped, and his face was full of embarrassment.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind was full of thoughts. As he sneered in his heart, he already understood that this guy in front of him wanted to align his words with his, so he continued to say.</p><p>“Brother Murong, when the Eighth Sword Deity and Huang Quan came out, I was immediately controlled by an unknown mental strength. It’s not that I didn’t want to remind you, but I really couldn’t move my body at all!”</p><p>“Thinking about it, brother, you were also like this at that time?”</p><p>Murong Ying’s eyes lit up and he said loudly, “Ah, right, right, right! I also felt the same way at that time, so…”</p><p>“That’s why we delayed the operation!” Xu Xiaoshou continued and laughed mischievously.</p><p>Murong Ying took a deep breath and sized up Wang Chao from head to toe as if he had gotten to know this person again. “You kid, you’re really good. You’ve hidden yourself well enough. Why didn’t I notice that you were so cunning before!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
