How could they guard the mountain?</p><p>How could Xu Xiaoshou not have thought of this? He chuckled and took out the “Dragon Lord’s flag”.</p><p>He turned his head and swept his gaze over, and his gaze fell on a familiar face.</p><p>“Li Yan!”</p><p>“Ah?” Li Yan was stunned. He stared at Leader Mu’s “Dragon Lord’s flag” and he seemed to have realized something.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou passed the flag over and patted his shoulder. He then said earnestly, “I’ll leave the Dragon Range Grand Array to you. I believe in your ability and talent. You need a platform to show your ability!”</p><p>Li Yan’s face darkened and he almost knelt. He then shouted, “Leader Mu, think it over. I don’t have the ability to take on the ‘Dragon Lord’s flag’. Moreover, I, Li Yan, don’t have the intention to usurp the position!”</p><p>What was he thinking… Xu Xiaoshou then said happily.</p><p>“I know you’re very loyal to the Xu Faction. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have given the ‘Dragon Lord’s flag’ to you.”</p><p>“Don’t worry. As long as the Xu Faction still exists and its reputation is still out there, very few people would dare to have any plans on the Fourth Dragon Range.</p><p>“What I’m worried about is only ‘what if’.</p><p>“As long as you hold the ‘Dragon Lord’s flag’ and have the support of the Dragon Range Grand Array, you can eliminate the possibility of ‘what if’!”</p><p>Li Yan was still trembling with fear. “But…”</p><p>“There’s no but!” Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand and said solemnly. “Everyone, listen up and immediately return to defend the Fourth Dragon Range. If anything happens to our Xu Faction’s headquarters, you can bring your heads to see me!”</p><p>With this military order, the Xu Faction members did not dare to disobey.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The ten or so people responded and carried the “Dragon Lord’s flag” as they hurried back.</p><p>…</p><p>“They’ve left.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the departing figures of the Xu Faction members and began to have a bold idea in his mind.</p><p>With a heavy heart, he sank into the Yuan Mansion world.</p><p>In the Yuan Mansion world, which was full of vitality and spiritual energy, poisonous flowers, plants, and vines were growing wantonly. There was the collapsed tower, the fish pond, the expanding land area, and the chaotic mist at the edge of the space as usual.</p><p>At the center of the world, there were treasures like the Bodhi ancient wood, the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch, and the Nine Great Ancestral Trees. Surrounded by all kinds of high-grade spiritual ingredients, they were growing healthily.</p><p>On the other side, Greedy the Cat Spirit, who had put in a lot of effort, was constantly moving among the 100,000 alchemy cauldrons, jumping back and forth.</p><p>“How did it become like this?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou entered the Yuan mansion with his thought and was immediately stunned.</p><p>The originally chaotic structure of the Yuan Mansion world had been well-organized.</p><p>The most eye-catching spiritual herb fields had all been moved to the center of the world. It was located under the Spirit Mark of Life, Path Principles Origin Stone, and so on.</p><p>“Lei Xi’er?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts entered his portrait clone, and the corners of his mouth suddenly curled up as he thought of a person.</p><p>Without a doubt, the only one who could clean up the dirty and messy situation of the Yuan Mansion world to such an extent was undoubtedly the newly promoted little gardener Lei Xi’er.</p><p>He turned his gaze toward the center of the herb field.</p><p>As expected, the silver-haired Lei Xi’er was dressed in a robe that belonged to Xu Xiaoshou. She was carrying a watering jug and moving around among the various spiritual plants.</p><p>A dignified Sovereign (stage) expert, a dignified descendant of the Lei family, and a dignified host of the God Devil Eyes…</p><p>Due to the monotony of the Yuan mansion world, it had fallen to such a state!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression became awkward. He walked to the vicinity of the herb field. He opened his mouth and subconsciously wanted to call out “Junior Sister”, but when he looked at the tall and graceful silver-haired woman, he paused for a moment.</p><p>“Lei Xi’er,” he called out her real name.</p><p>“Mmm?” Lei Xi’er stopped and turned her head around. The breeze brushed past her silver hair and landed on her delicate face.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. “What are you doing?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er regained her composure and gently gestured at the small wooden pot in her hand. She bent down again to water the spiritual plants.</p><p>Artificial cultivation of spiritual ingredients indeed required regular watering, but Xu Xiaoshou did not understand these things.</p><p>His aggressive cultivation method was to move all of these things to the Yuan Mansion world and use vitality and spiritual energy to madly irrigate them.</p><p>It was all thanks to the birth of the Yuan Mansion world and the Spirit Mark of Life.</p><p>Otherwise, these spiritual ingredients would have long withered to death in other places.</p><p>At this moment, Lei Xi’er walked past the spiritual herb field and came to the side of the Bodhi ancient wood. She squatted down and gently stroked the ancient wood as if she could feel the aura of the same origin.</p><p>“I can help you raise the Bodhi ancient wood. You already have the primordial purple mist. The rest is just a matter of time. With the Nine Great Ancestral Trees guarding it, your Yuan Mansion world will be very stable when it takes shape in the future.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er paused for a moment and looked at the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch beside her. “This won’t do. It’s just a withered branch that broke off from the blood tree. Although it contains the power of the blood tree, it has no chance of becoming a tree.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly remembered that his junior sister had a wood attribute, to begin with. Raising these things was indeed her specialty.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
