His tone gradually became heavier, but he soon realized that the current Xu Xiaoshou no longer belonged to the Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>His last sentence became gentler, and he said with a sigh, “You are Xu Xiaoshou, not Aje. What right do you have to stop Aje from becoming a normal person?”</p><p>This gentle last sentence was like a bolt of lightning that suddenly exploded in Xu Xiaoshou’s mind.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was somewhat persuaded.</p><p>The headmaster’s words were not without reason.</p><p>Aje was like a child with an innate stage defect, and the symptoms were almost unsolvable.</p><p>But even so, there was still such a doctor in this world who was willing to spend decades studying the symptoms and trying to treat them.</p><p>Was this a bad thing?</p><p>No! This was actually Aje’s luck!</p><p>...</p><p>However, even though he knew this, Xu Xiaoshou was not bereft of reason.</p><p>He knew that if Hallmaster Dao could cure Aje, Aje would not have fallen into his hands.</p><p>But if even the unpredictable Dao Qiongcang could not cure Aje, then who else in this world would dare to say that they could truly cure Aje?</p><p>“How confident is Elder Qiao?” Xu Xiaoshou closed his eyes. His voice was like a mosquito, almost inaudible.</p><p>“He didn’t say, and I didn’t ask… but I believe him. Just like how your master believes me, you can also believe what your master believes,” Ye Xiaotian said honestly.</p><p>“30%? 50%?” Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t leave Aje to fate. He urgently needed a positive answer.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian sighed and didn’t respond directly. “If Aje succeeds, it may reach the demi-saint level. If it fails, it may be injured, dead, or crippled. At most, it will retain its current appearance.”</p><p>“How am I supposed to hand Aje over to you?!” Xu Xiaoshou flew into a rage.</p><p>If Aje succeeded in reaching the demi-saint level.,.</p><p>This sounded gratifying, but even the Hallmaster Dao could not do it, right?</p><p>Could Elder Qiao succeed?</p><p>Such a huge amount of success was bound to be accompanied by an unbearable ending of failure.</p><p>If it really failed…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to think further.</p><p>At this moment, he even wanted to stretch out his hand and slap Ye Xiaotian away before leaving. He felt that Ye Xiaotian was messing with him.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian took a deep breath, his heart was heavy.</p><p>He knew that being honest was disadvantageous to the outcome. Perhaps at this time, as long as he was a little roundabout and directly answered a “70%” or “90%”, Xu Xiaoshou would give up Aje without a second word.</p><p>However, Ye Xiaotian would not do that. He also disdained it.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, perhaps you do only know a little about your master. However, you don’t know about Tiansang Spirit Palace and the seniors you’ve met before.” Ye Xiaotian sighed.</p><p>“Headmaster, if you have something to say, just say it.” Xu Xiaoshou lost his respectful tone for a moment as he became alert. He knew that the headmaster might try to hide things from him.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian didn’t blame him. He just smiled and said shockingly, “I, your master, Old Qiao, and Old Xiao are all from the Holy Palace.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyebrows jumped, but he didn’t look surprised. “So?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian remained calm and continued.</p><p>“What does the Holy Palace mean?”</p><p>“To put it simply, it means that you have passed the Imperial City Trial and are now in the top 36. You will also have to go through the next round of continent-level selection. After a great wave of gold mining, you will have to be chosen out of the absolute elites to be qualified to enter the Holy Palace.”</p><p>“And this is only the basic qualification.”</p><p>“The legacy of the Holy Palace has not been severed. There are a lot of outstanding geniuses and evildoers in it. These people would make those who had just entered the Holy Palace be ashamed of themselves and be depressed for a few years before they are unable to catch up.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian suddenly paused, and his eyes lit up. He said in a heavy voice, “But at that time, the four of us were known as the four strongest among the young generation of the Holy Palace, namely… The Four Disciples of the Holy Palace, Qiao Xiao Ye Sang!”</p><p>The Four Disciples of the Holy Palace?</p><p>Qiao Xiao Ye Sang?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t hold in his surprise any longer.</p><p>It was the first time he had heard of this term, but through the introduction of the headmaster, he could already imagine what kind of title it was.</p><p>Previously, when Elder Sang had revealed his strength bit by bit and disclosed later that he was from the Infernal lineage of the Holy Palace, Xu Xiaoshou had felt that Tiansang Spirit Palace was a little scary and that there should be a lot of power hidden in it.</p><p>After which, when Ye Xiaotian displayed his space attributes, Xu Xiaoshou thought that he was just a “special case under normal circumstances”.</p><p>However, after entering the martial arts world and witnessing so many Sovereigns and Cutting Paths, Xu Xiaoshou had already understood the meaning behind the space attributes. Furthermore, Ye Xiaotian had also comprehended the Spatial Upanishad, which was comparable to the Spirit Division Chief.</p><p>At this moment, he felt that the Tiansang Spirit Palace was even more terrifying.</p><p>However, what he didn’t expect was that the ordinary Elder Qiao and the plain and unadorned Xiao Qixiu, were on the same level as Elder sang and Ye Xiaotian in the Holy Palace?</p><p>They were at the highest level… the Four Disciples of the Holy Palace?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he was listening to a story, a fantasy story that was very unreal. He didn’t make a sound. Instead, he silently watched and quietly waited for Ye Xiaotian to continue.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian gave the ignorant young man enough time to calm down before he continued.</p><p>“In the Holy Palace, your master’s temper was the most explosive, and I was the one with the best self-control.”</p><p>“However, in terms of talent, your Elder Qiao was the strongest. In terms of methods and combat strength… at that time, your Elder Xiao, was known as the ‘Butcher of Ten Thousand Blood’.</p><p>“The three of us were the ones who had to settle his mess. Basically, we were the ones who had to wipe his ass.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned by this vulgar description.</p><p>This…</p><p>Was very unscientific!</p><p>Xiao Qixiu, the Butcher of Ten Thousand Blood?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou vaguely remembered that night in the Spirit Palace, when Elder Xiao tried to stab Bazhun’an with his sword but ended up being pierced through the chest and almost died.</p><p>This was the only time he had an impression of Xiao Qixiu’s attack.</p><p>He had to admit that it was also the time that made him feel that Elder Xiao was… very, uh, somewhat ordinary!</p><p>“Hehe, did you also remember that sword strike?”</p><p>As if he could read Xu Xiaoshou’s mind, Ye Xiaotian smiled and said, “Actually, you didn’t need to expect so much from your Elder Xiao. Because that night, I was also amputated by Bazhun’an.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly woke up.</p><p>That was Bazhun’an!</p><p>At that time, even the headmaster could not defeat him. Even Elder Sang could not keep him there, let alone Xiao Qixiu.</p><p>Just as Xu Xiaoshou was thinking about this, Ye Xiaotian continued.</p><p>“Everything that you didn’t understand at that time should be clear to you now.</p><p>“Bazhun’an is very arrogant. Under normal circumstances, no one in this world who dares to point a sword at him will be able to survive.”</p><p>“Yes, Xiao Qixiu survived… I know it’s lame to say this, but Bazhun’an is, after all, a rare monster. He is comparable to an ash-level expert of the older generation. You can carefully consider his choice and think about what exactly this means?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was at a loss.</p><p>He thought of Su Qianqian’s family again, who died while trying to defend themselves.</p><p>That’s right. Why was Elder Xiao able to survive at that time? Was it because he was special?</p><p>What was special about him?</p><p>Did the Holy Palace produce all the geniuses because Bazhun’an valued talent?</p><p>So, what special talent did Elder Xiao have that he, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t discover?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought about it again and again, but he still didn’t understand.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian didn’t describe Xiao Qixiu too much, because he was only used as a contrast to Qiao Qianzhi. He only paused for a moment and then continued.</p><p>“Let’s not talk about other topics. Among the Four Disciples of the Holy Palace, the most talented one is not the three of us, but your Elder Qiao.”</p><p>“At that time, Qiao Qianzhi’s talent was so outstanding that he was almost comparable to the Eighth Sword Deity. However, after he broke through to the sovereign stage, he made a crazy decision…”</p><p>“He wants to become a pure spirit array caster!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment, but he soon felt relieved. He felt that this was indeed a decision made by a mad man. At this time, he already thought that all the F4 in the Spirit Palace were madmen. They were very abnormal.</p><p>Moreover, he also concluded that the “Spirit array caster” defined by Elder Qiao was probably not a normal “Spirit array caster”.</p><p>When Ye Xiaotian said this, he seemed a little helpless. He then shrugged and said,</p><p>“Qiao Qianzhi believes that in this world, ‘diagram’… Yes, the ‘formation diagram’ is the external manifestation of all things. While ‘pattern’… you can understand it as a simple ‘spiritual pattern’, ‘path pattern’, and so on.”</p><p>“‘Pattern’ is the internal form of all things.”</p><p>“And the abstract mental will that a person possesses has the ability to change and even create ‘diagram’ through ‘pattern’, thereby ‘materializing abstract things’.</p><p>“In short, it is the ability to turn ‘Fantasy’ into ‘Reality’.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
