Her expression instantly became much more relaxed.</p><p>“Huang Quan, do you really think that after taking down Night Guardian, you can influence my decision?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao held her Cang Godhood Sword inversely, gradually revealing the sharpness of a Sword Deity. Her aura burst forth, and in an instant, she walked out from Xu Xiaoshou’s guidance, as if she had regained control of the scene.</p><p>What happened?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not understand, but he suddenly had a bad premonition in his heart.</p><p>He knew that Rao Yaoyao would wait since she was also stalling for time. She was waiting for an opportunity to take down everyone.</p><p>However, after such a long time, the targets in front of her changed again and again, from Xu Xiaoshou to Yi, and then to Huang Quan.</p><p>Theoretically speaking, without making any prior preparations, the opportunity that Rao Yaoyao was waiting for might not be able to withstand Huang Quan’s combat strength.</p><p>However, just a moment ago, Xu Xiaoshou could sense that Rao Yaoyao’s mentality had changed.</p><p>She had returned to her identity as the red-clothed’s law enforcer as if she had obtained a power that could counterbalance “Huang Quan’s” space-time power.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not know what other arrangements the law enforcer had. He could only adapt to the changing situation by remaining unchanged. He smiled nonchalantly and said,</p><p>“You don’t want to trade, right?</p><p>“My interest in your subordinate is actually not much less than the Cang Godhood Sword in your hand. Since you don’t want to trade…”</p><p>He spread out his hands.</p><p>“The deal is over.”</p><p>Thump thump!</p><p>Thump thump!</p><p>His heart began to beat faster.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that he was being impulsive and that this was just his prediction based on spiritual quality.</p><p>Next, Rao Yaoyao would surely be prepared to take action. The reason why she suddenly chose to jump out from the topic of “Huang Quan” was definitely because she had a terrifying power.</p><p>Run!</p><p>After calmly finishing the last sentence and perfecting Huang Quan’s image, Xu Xiaoshou only had the thought of “Run” in his mind.</p><p>From his appearance to the end, Huang Quan’s goal was very clear.</p><p>He had originally come here for the God Devil Eyes. After being discovered by the law enforcer, he took the opportunity to capture the Night Guardian of the red-clothed and expressed his interest in the Cang Godhood Sword as well as his desire to discover the secrets of the Night Guardian.</p><p>All of this was enough!</p><p>It was enough for Huang Quan to kill Yi, take the imitator, and pour all the blames on the saint servant. In the end, he wanted to make another profit, but if he couldn’t, he would leave. This was very reasonable!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that until now, Huang Quan’s performance wasn’t too abnormal.</p><p>He had successfully shifted the murder of Yi to Yama and removed the hatred the law enforcer team had toward the saint servant, Xu Xiaoshou, so…</p><p>If he didn’t run now, when else should he do it?</p><p>“Everyone, we shall meet again someday.”</p><p>Without giving Rao Yaoyao more time to react, Xu Xiaoshou pointed at the void and continued to “slow down time”.</p><p>Under the situation where everyone’s body suddenly stiffened, he did not hesitate at all. He took the lead to look in Lei Xi’er’s direction and directly opened the Yuan Mansion world’s spatial passageway above the latter’s head.</p><p>Even at this critical moment, Xu Xiaoshou did not forget to cover up the Yuan mansion world’s spatial passageway.</p><p>He used ‘drawing expertise’ to draw the real ‘spatial vortex’ that Huang Quan would use when he left the arena on the spatial passageway.</p><p>“Enter!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not use telepathic communication as he was afraid that he would be intercepted by a higher being, and this would expose his identity.</p><p>However, with just a glance, Lei Xi’er managed to read his thoughts. She initially wanted to jump into the spatial passageway without hesitation…</p><p>At this moment, a sudden change occurred!</p><p>In the sky above the cliff, wind and clouds suddenly gathered and took the form of dozens of clouds and morph forms.</p><p>These huge beasts covered the sky and the sun. They had a ten-foot-long horn on their head and stood on seven-colored auspicious clouds. Their bodies were like big fish with scales of clouds. They carried wings that could cover half of the sky on their backs. They looked like the ancient beast, Kun Peng.</p><p>Cloud Beast!</p><p>A total of thirty-six cloud beasts appeared and filled up the entire sky.</p><p>What was worse was that these mild-mannered cloud beasts seemed to have been provoked when they appeared. They went crazy and cried out one after another.</p><p>“Wu!”</p><p>“Wu Wu Wu!”</p><p>“Wu Wu Wu Wu Wu…”</p><p>The terrifying mental attack caused Xu Xiaoshou’s head to go dizzy.</p><p>In a daze, the ‘time delay’ power was forced to stop, and the Yuan mansion space above Lei Xi’er’s head also shattered.</p><p>Lei Xi’er had the self-protection mechanism of the God Devil Eyes, so she was completely unaffected by the Cloud Beast’s mental attack.</p><p>But when she jumped forward, the Yuan Mansion world’s spatial passageway was gone!</p><p>This sudden change made Lei Xi’er slightly dazed, but she quickly calmed down.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t the ‘real’ Huang Quan. Facing Rao Yaoyao’s backup plan, he wouldn’t be able to handle the situation alone! Moreover, this time, it was a strange cloud beast with mental attack power… dozens of them!</p><p>Compared to entering the Yuan mansion, staying behind would be more helpful to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Lei Xi’er did not hesitate at all. She turned her head and faced Xu Xiaoshou’s direction. Her God Devil Eyes Spun.</p><p>“Release!”</p><p>A white mist appeared from her left eye.</p><p>The moment the divine power was released, Xu Xiaoshou’s dazed state was instantly relieved. He immediately came back to his senses.</p><p>There was no time to thank her. Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have sensed something and looked to the other side.</p><p>At the same time, Ye Xiaotian’s dizzy state was also relieved with the help of Lei Xi’er’s God Devil Eyes.</p><p>The three of them looked at the culprit of this change in fear…</p><p>A person!</p><p>A rather handsome and suave young man.</p><p>He was surrounded by a total of 365 golden array tokens. His luxurious clothes were inlaid with gold and jade, and on his belt hung small pagodas, bell cauldrons, small shields, and other morph forms of spiritual weapons.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
