It was unexpected and yet reasonable.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could see it.</p><p>At this time, after losing the reminder from the key figure Night Guardian, Rao Yaoyao and the others were completely unaware of their thoughts being led astray by him.</p><p>In short, the rhythm of the other party had been messed up!</p><p>It was true that the powerful aura brought about by the Swallow the Mountains and Rivers was the foundation. Subsequently, the firm belief of “I am Huang Quan” had affected the emotions of everyone.</p><p>But more importantly…</p><p>Logic!</p><p>If there was a mistake in the underlying logic, any random person could unveil his disguise, let alone a peerless wise general like Rao Yaoyao!</p><p>Facing hundreds of gazes, Xu Xiaoshou remained calm. He narrowed his eyes as if hundreds of watermelons were in front of him. He looked at each of them fearlessly and took a few breaths of time to create the heavy psychological pressure that made the entire crowd silent before the big boss spoke.</p><p>Only then did he begin to speak.</p><p>“I would like to make a deal with Sword Deity Rao.”</p><p>He slightly turned his head back and twirled his fingertips lightly. It seemed like he was quite serious about this matter, but there was a hint of cynicism in his words. He then raised his “motive” in a relaxed manner.</p><p>A deal…</p><p>Among the Law Enforcer Team, everyone turned their heads in unison to look at their leader and thought that making a deal with boss Yama wasn’t a good thing.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao similarly narrowed her eyes, concealing her shock and doubt.</p><p>She did not think that she could continue chatting with the other party. However, by saying so, Huang Quan must have had some confidence.</p><p>In that case, she would listen to what he had to say.</p><p>“What deal?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao spoke indifferently, neither agreed nor declined. She was very experienced.</p><p>“I like your dignified and steady look…” the corners of Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth that were hidden under the mask curled up slightly. He thought to himself, “Let’s see if you can still maintain this kind of mature and steady look later!”</p><p>“Let’s put the deal aside for now…</p><p>“Before that, I have a grand gift that I would like to invite everyone to take a look.”</p><p>Huang Quan, the golden-masked Sovereign (stage) sitting in the air, stretched his hand to the side as he spoke. He pointed at… the void in the mountain forest on the opposite side of the ocean of clouds among the Lone Cliff, that was far away from the law enforcers and outside the bounded domain!</p><p>His posture was extremely similar to that of an extremely high-ranking big shot who had deigned to step down from the stage and personally lifted the veil of the final secret treasure during the auction.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao narrowed her eyes and hesitated for a moment before waving her hand and saying, “Close the bounded domain.”</p><p>The law enforcers all held their breaths. After executing their orders, they turned their heads in the direction that Huang Quan was pointing at with slight curiosity. Even Lei Xi’er and Ye Xiaotian were no exception.</p><p>Everyone could see three figures had appeared outside the bounded domain in the empty void!</p><p>On the left, a masked person was in a red robe. She had a slim figure and seemed to be a woman. Under her mask, there was a pair of beautiful eyes with cherry-pink tints. There seemed to be layers of blooming stamens in them.</p><p>On the right, a masked person was in a light green robe. He was a man. His body was covered by a long robe. No one could tell his features, but at the same time, his eyes were very eye-catching. It was a pair of strange eyes. The green and orange eyes overlapped each other and formed a cross. It seemed to contain a terrifying power.</p><p>Between the two of them, there was a man in tattered black clothes. His body was stained with blood and his hair was disheveled. His head was low and his face could not be seen clearly. His aura was extremely dispirited. At this moment… anyone with a discerning eye could tell that he was not in a good condition.</p><p>In the entire scene, the first person to react to those two pairs of extremely strange eyes was not Rao Yaoyao, nor was it someone from the Law Enforcer Team.</p><p>It was Lei Xi’er!</p><p>She recognized the origins of those two pairs of eyes at a glance, and she was instantly shocked.</p><p>She then tilted her head and looked at Huang Quan, who was sitting steadily in the air with a posture of having everything under control. In Lei Xi’er’s eyes, they were filled with shock, doubt, disbelief… a myriad of emotions!</p><p>Without thinking too much, Lei Xi’er quickly lowered her head to prevent her reaction from being seen by the law enforcer, thus exposing Xu Xiaoshou’s disguise.</p><p>“Respected, Passive points +1, +1 , +1, +1…”</p><p>On the other end…</p><p>What did he want to show me?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao didn’t recognize what Huang Quan had wanted her to see first.</p><p>But at this moment, a law enforcer who was originally under the white-clothed people had been deployed because of the urgent need arrived behind Rao Yaoyao with a shocked expression.</p><p>“Sword Deity Rao!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao looked back at the person who spoke out.</p><p>The law enforcer whispered into her ear, “According to the white-clothed people’s internal intelligence… the red-robed masked man on the left is suspected to be a member of Yama’s organization, ‘the Visitor from the Netherworld’. He has a cultivation level of the Cutting Path (stage), but he possesses the Lei family’s eyes — Flower Fairy Eyes.”</p><p>Instantly, Rao Yaoyao raised her eyes and stared at the red-robed masked man’s cherry-pink eyes. The image of the silver-haired woman beside her, “God Devil Eyes”, flashed through her mind.</p><p>The Lei family’s eyes, Flower Fairy Eyes?</p><p>That pair of eyes that possessed supreme Illusion Technique?</p><p>Yama was indeed collecting the Lei family’s eyes! And he had already obtained a great harvest!</p><p>At this moment, Rao Yaoyao’s deduction of Huang Quan’s appearance just now had been confirmed with even more certainty.</p><p>The law enforcer of the white-clothed did not stop talking. After a pause, he said solemnly, “The green-robed masked man on the right should be ‘Hundred Ghost Night Walk’. There’s even less information about him, but if nothing goes wrong, that pair of eyes should be the ‘Cross-shaped Eyes’.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
