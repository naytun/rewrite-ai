However, he could only reach out his hand. He wanted to completely disintegrate the ultimate crystal of the power of space.</p><p>Just like every single time he fought back, Ye Xiaotian called out.</p><p>However, after the Way of the Heavens responded, all of his targets seemed to have landed on another sky fragment in a parallel space-time continuum.</p><p>The fake one was gone.</p><p>The real one was still attacking him.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>There was an explosion, and blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>Even though Ye Xiaotian had already placed himself into the great path of space, his opponent also had space attributes, so he was still able to hit him.</p><p>The sky fragment hit his body, and Ye Xiaotian was thrown out of the Way of the Heavens. He crashed heavily into the wall of the bounded domain and slowly slid down. He was in the blink of death.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was watching from the outside, sucked in a breath of cold air. He unconsciously clenched his fists.</p><p>This was the difference between heaven and earth, the difference between clouds and mud!</p><p>Inside the bounded domain, Huang Quan looked at Ye Xiaotian, who was on his last breath and had no strength to struggle. Huang Quan slowly said, “Ye Xiaotian, don’t be discouraged. Your Space Upanishad is unrivaled in the world, and you can even kill the higher void. It’s a pity that you’ve met me this time.”</p><p>“Originally, we only wanted to take the Saint Origin Crystal in your hands, but after seeing your ability, I have to say that I admire you very much.</p><p>“Join Yama. I need your strength!”</p><p>Huang Quan invited him seriously, but Ye Xiaotian, who was on the ground, still didn’t reply.</p><p>“You have a backbone.”</p><p>Huang Quan praised. He turned around and said to the Nine Serenities Ghost Child and Reborn Lily, who were far behind him, “See? This is the combat strength that you should have after reaching the final stage of the Attribute Upanishad.”</p><p>“I can give you two the inheritance of the Upanishad. However, you can’t just learn the knowledge from the books. You lack battle experience with your opponents. The current you are not even one-tenth of Yu Lingdi and Ye Xiaotian’s strength.</p><p>“Just like the Nine Sereneties…”</p><p>As Huang Quan spoke, he looked at the Nine Serenities Ghost Child who was trembling in fear, and said with a smile, “Last time, you said that it was the Saint Servant, Xu Xiaoshou defeated you because he had Fourth Sword and also the Divine Puppet.”</p><p>“However, if you truly grasped the power of the ‘Iron Upanishad’, not to mention the Fourth Sword and the Divine Puppet, even a hundred Xu Xiaoshou would not be a match for you.</p><p>“At the very least, the possessor of the attribute Upanishad would always be in an invincible position, just like Ye Xiaotian…”</p><p>He paused for a moment, then pointed his finger behind him.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was on his last breath, but he still made some moves in the dark. He wanted to use the bounded domain to transform himself and then escape from this place. However, he was sealed by Huang Quan’s space-time power and completely lost the chance to escape.</p><p>“Upanishad is the strongest power in this world.”</p><p>“The ways of the sword are innumerable. It’s really complicated. In thousands of years, only one Bazhun’an has been born to master it.”</p><p>“Spiritual cultivation is different. It’s one of the 3,000 great paths. Anyone who masters it can grasp the power of Upanishad, so it’s more suitable for this mediocre world.”</p><p>“This is also why the era of spiritual cultivation can replace the era of the way of the sword!”</p><p>Huang Quan’s words shook the deaf and enlightened.</p><p>After he finished speaking, his gaze landed on the two fresh blood in the organization. He sighed and said, “The two of you still need to continue training…”</p><p>Nine Serenities Ghost Child and Reborn Lily didn’t even dare to refute him. They nodded their heads in agreement as if they were little chickens.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou recalled Huang Quan’s thought-provoking words in his heart, but he didn’t think too much about it at this moment.</p><p>He couldn’t stand it anymore, and he couldn’t wait any longer.</p><p>He knew that the Dean wouldn’t surrender. At this rate, he would only die in battle.</p><p>Huang Quan’s strength wasn’t ordinary, but he was clearly not a demi-saint. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be unable to sense the situation outside from within the bounded domain.</p><p>Of course, this could also be because Ye Xiaotian’s bounded domain was too powerful.</p><p>No matter what, the Dean had already revealed his bounded domain and asked the red-clothed for help.</p><p>He had to think of a way.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned his head to look at Murong Ying. He couldn’t help but ask, “Captain, the other team members haven’t arrived yet? Are we just going to wait like this?”</p><p>“What’s the rush?” Murong Ying turned his head and said, “The two stowaways inside must have gotten into a fight before they opened up their bounded domain. Looking at this bounded domain, the people inside are at most capable of Cutting Path. When both of them are injured and come out, our team members will arrive just in time to take them down.”</p><p>“When Huang Quan comes out on his own initiative, you won’t even be able to touch his shadow! Most importantly, Ye Xiaotian, you, me, and that team member who hasn’t arrived yet might all die!” Xu Xiaoshou cursed in his heart.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was anxious. Then, he suddenly thought of a plan.</p><p>He looked into the distance, towards the direction above the bounded domain. Pointing with a finger, he said with a terrified expression, “Captain, look, there’s a Bazhun’an over there!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
