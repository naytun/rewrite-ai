It was also eying at the treasure of suppressing barriers in the Yuan Mansion World — the Eye of Heaven.</p><p>It was evolved from the Heaven Pearl that Xu Xiaoshou had swindled from Jiang Xian in Bazhun’an identity.</p><p>The Eye of Heaven was originally trapped in the Heaven Pearl and entered the Yuan Mansion World, turning into a treasure of suppressing barrier. Only by borrowing the power of the world could its power be released.</p><p>However, until now, Xu Xiaoshou still couldn’t figure out what function the Eye of Heaven had.</p><p>However, there was a person with the bloodline of the Lei family standing in front of him…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that if he didn’t tell the whole story, Lei Xi’er’s God Devil Eyes, which were spinning at high speed, would probably cut him into a thousand pieces with just its ocular power alone!</p><p>Immediately, he told everything about how he disguised himself as Bazhun’an, entered the Jiang clan’s mansion, and seized the Heaven Pearl, and how he used Elder Sang’s body to enter the Heaven Prayer Forest and seized the Three Loathsome Eyes from Yama’s organization.</p><p>After telling everything, Xu Xiaoshou added, “I know you don’t believe me, but that’s the truth. The Three Loathsome Eyes were accidentally swallowed by the Greedy the Cat Spirit. I had no choice. This was not intentional blasphemy, it was just an accident… and the Eye of Heaven, if you want it, I can immediately return it to you.”</p><p>He felt that he had never been so humble, especially in front of his junior sister.</p><p>But there was nothing he could do about it…</p><p>The Lei family’s eyes belonged to them. He had inexplicably obtained two of them, and they were discovered by the owner.</p><p>Even though he explained it, Xu Xiaoshou still felt he was like a thief.</p><p>Lei Xi’er listened in a daze.</p><p>The details that Xu Xiaoshou said were things that Mu Zixi had never heard of before.</p><p>For example, she knew that Xu Xiaoshou had acted alone before, but she didn’t expect him to be so bold as to pretend to be Eighth Sword Deity and trick the Demi-Saint’s descendant, Jiang Xian, into giving him the Eye of Heaven.</p><p>Wasn’t he afraid of death?</p><p>What if he was caught!</p><p>And then there was the Heaven Prayer Forest…</p><p>For an organization like Yama that coveted the Lei family’s eyes, its Cutting Path members had both the Flower Fairy Eyes and the Cross-Shaped Eyes at the cultivation level.</p><p>Under such circumstances, Xu Xiaoshou could still obtain the Three Loathsome Eyes with his Innate (stage) cultivation level.</p><p>It was unbelievable!</p><p>Did this guy even have a brain? If the plan failed, wouldn’t he have to pay with his life?</p><p>Looking at Xu Xiaoshou in front of her, she was a little scared as if she wouldn’t believe his words. However, Lei Xi’er was actually more frightened by Xu Xiaoshou’s boldness and actions.</p><p>She was silent for a moment and did not say anything else. She only muttered the word “Yama” in Xu Xiaoshou’s words and seemed to have come to a realization.</p><p>“I believe you.”</p><p>Under Xu Xiaoshou’s nervous gaze, Lei Xi’er regained her calm expression. After speaking softly, she pointed at the Eye of Heaven in the sky and said, “I won’t forcefully take the Three Loathsome Eyes, but you have to return the Eye of Heaven to me.”</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand, and the Eye of Heaven, which was still hanging in the sky, flew down.</p><p>He handed the eye over and said, “Return it to its original owner. This is its destiny.”</p><p>Destiny… Lei Xi’er took the Eye of Heaven and stared at it silently for a long time. The Eye of Heaven suddenly stopped spinning, and her eyes showed grief.</p><p>“Uncle Tian…” she muttered to herself.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the long eyelashes of the silver-haired woman in front of him and trembled. He felt as if he was about to cry. His heart clenched as he felt the sorrowful aura around Lei Xi’er.</p><p>He could not imagine how Lei Xi’er, who was still a child then, escaped from the great calamity when the Higher Void (level) Lei family was exterminated.</p><p>Perhaps, the appearance of the junior sister was fated and not an accident.</p><p>Or perhaps, she could wake up again, which was the choice of fate and not the work of human power.</p><p>But…</p><p>Sometimes, not knowing might be a kind of happiness!</p><p>“I’m sorry, I made you recall bad things,” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know how to comfort her, so he could only stand by the side and wait quietly.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit seemed to have noticed that the atmosphere wasn’t right, so it hid in its owner’s arms and didn’t dare to move.</p><p>It thought of how this girl with a familiar aura had fed it in the Yuan Mansion world a long time ago.</p><p>Although she had changed her appearance, Greedy the Cat Spirit could recognize that she was the same person.</p><p>It slowly stretched out a claw as if to comfort her. It scratched in the void and meowed softly.</p><p>Xi’er returned to her senses and looked at Greedy the Cat Spirit. Suddenly, she smiled sweetly.</p><p>She stretched out her delicate hand and stroked the soft white fur on Greedy the Cat Spirit’s head. Then, she looked up at Xu Xiaoshou. Her eyes were filled with determination, “We should go now.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked by the murderous intent in her eyes. He hesitated for a moment, and he still tried to persuade her. “Although I told you about Yama, Yama is too strong and mysterious. Even I don’t dare to act rashly… With your current cultivation level, you can’t even defeat one of the members. After you go out, you must not act rashly.”</p><p>“Don’t worry,” Lei Xi’er said indifferently.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath and didn’t say anything else.</p><p>Junior Sister was no longer here. What would happen to Lei Xi’er was something that needed to be considered in the future.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
