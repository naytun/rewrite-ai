Xu Xiaoshou’s heart couldn’t help but beat faster.</p><p>If he was to calculate his options, he could travel to another location while avoiding the spatial fragment by “Ascending to the Heavens in A Single Step”, “Teleport with the array wheel”, or “Taking the easy way out of the spatial passageway that Ye Xiaotian opened in the Tiansang Spirit Palace to the Tianxuan Gate”.</p><p>This seemed to be the first time that he had truly stepped into the spatial fragment and experienced the power of this unknown place.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was nervous, but he was also a little excited.</p><p>Other than Murong Ying’s spiritual source as a barrier, the current him didn’t seem to have any obstacles with the spatial fragment. It was as if they were facing each other openly.</p><p>In the air…</p><p>No, there was no air!</p><p>On the opposite side of this shattered and dark space, there wasn’t anything from the heaven and earth element.</p><p>There was only the space node. It was fragmented and dense, messy and complicated.</p><p>Coming to this unique place that was filled with violence, chaos, unknown, and mystery, Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he had come to the dark side of the Shengshen continent.</p><p>Every space on the continent could be broken, and one could enter the spatial fragment.</p><p>However, without a powerful foundation, this place could swallow anything, even a demi-saint. If one was to get lost in such a dark place, one could very well die.</p><p>To those without space attributes, the spatial fragment was a place of chaos. It was a place where one could not stay for long.</p><p>However, when Xu Xiaoshou came here, it was as if he had returned to another home. It was dilapidated, lawless, chaotic, and filled with a violent aura.</p><p>He had all attributes, or rather, no attributes.</p><p>After experiencing the long process of having “no attributes”, the first thing he comprehended was the space attributes.</p><p>Therefore, it could be said that other than the way of the sword, Infernal White Flame, and other special attributes that were imposed by external forces, Xu Xiaoshou’s true main attribute was space.</p><p>Therefore, although the spatial power of the spatial fragment was violent, when he was in this place, he was able to perceive the path of space more clearly. It was like holding a spatial origin stone and comprehending it all the time.</p><p>However, when the spatial fragment was used by the spatial origin stone, the former had the risk of death after comprehending it for a long time, while the latter was extremely safe as the basic rule of the way of space.</p><p>After staying in the spatial fragment for a short while, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had gained a deeper understanding of path and was enlightened.</p><p>Among the knowledge he had just gained, there was not only the enlightenment of the way of space.</p><p>His state of mind, structure, and so on were also opened up when he was in the spatial fragment.</p><p>It was as if he had seen the door to a new world…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickly thought of many new methods of committing crimes, ways to destroy corpses and evidence, ways to deal with stolen goods, ways to lure the enemy in, and even ways to bring the power of the spatial fragment into the real world, using a short-term, efficient, and powerful blasting method.</p><p>“This place is very suitable for me…” Xu Xiaoshou muttered silently.</p><p>He had a premonition that this place would very likely become his second home, the kind that he would frequent.</p><p>Of course, the prerequisite was that he had to have the means to protect himself from the danger in his home.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>At this moment, a sharp spatial blade flew past from the side. There was no sound, but that speed allowed Xu Xiaoshou to imagine a sound in his mind.</p><p>What followed was a spatial storm that suddenly rose like a butterfly effect.</p><p>Countless spatial blade fragments coiled up and formed a tornado that was ten thousands foot tall and ten foot in size. It wreaked havoc in all directions, causing Xu Xiaoshou to break out in cold sweat.</p><p>“This place is too dangerous!”</p><p>He immediately dispelled the idea of making this place a second home.</p><p>Just as his thoughts turned, the spiritual source around him moved. Xu Xiaoshou discovered that he had been moved to another place by his captain, a place far away from the spatial storm, and was temporarily safe.</p><p>“Wang Chao!”</p><p>In the darkness, a faint telepathic communication came over. Xu Xiaoshou became vigilant and immediately remembered that there was actually another person beside him.</p><p>“Captain?” Xu Xiaoshou narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p>With that said, he pressed the Aje on his chest with one hand and held it with the other hand. His spiritual senses had already reached the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>As long as there was a need, the fourth sword could be unsheathed at any time.</p><p>After doing these actions, Xu Xiaoshou finally had some confidence. He asked in a deep voice, “Captain, what exactly do you want to tell me? What secret need you to come to this damned place to tell me?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
