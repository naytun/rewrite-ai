Their hair was disheveled, and their faces were dirty. Their bodies were filled with a cold murderous intent as if they were soldiers who had temporarily retreated from the battlefield to recuperate.</p><p>“Experienced and tough…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian could tell at a glance that among these people, the strongest expert was only at the Master (stage) Ying Yang State.</p><p>However, this was under the circumstances that they were able to release the suppression of their cultivation level in the Yunlun Mountain Range. Within the same cultivation level in Tiansang Spirit Palace, most of them might not be able to defeat the top of the Inner Yard Thirty-Three.</p><p>For example, Rao Yinyin, Su Qianqian, and even Zhang Xinxiong who had already passed away but had suppressed his cultivation level for a few years because of the Imperial City trial.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian took a deep breath and slowly exhaled.</p><p>Even though these people had disrupted him, how could he be angry with these juniors?</p><p>Ye Xiaotian stretched out his hand and grabbed the hexagonal crystal that was flying toward him without turning a corner.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Among the people who rushed over from behind, the man with a scar on his face shouted and became excited. He said, “Brother, you did well. Give me this Holy Power treasure and I’ll give you 50,000 points.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian floated in the air slightly and looked at the group of people approaching him indifferently.</p><p>These 10 or so people were a little far away. After a while then only did they finally arrive in front of him. As they were riding the wind to come over, they also lowered their voices and muttered.</p><p>“This is strange. Is this Shorty a fool? Or is he a mute who can’t speak?”</p><p>“No, the strangest thing is that the Holy Power treasure has a spiritual quality. Why did it run away when we chased after it, but when it came to the shorty…”</p><p>“It didn’t run away?”</p><p>These people were not stupid. They all noticed that something was strange.</p><p>Not only that, but the shorty also looked strange.</p><p>A graceful man in a white robe was deep in thought. Very soon, he patted the head of the scarred man on the shoulder and whispered in his ear, “Brother Lei Zhou, there’s something wrong with this person. I can’t tell if his cultivation level is real or not. He’s either a mortal or a monster.”</p><p>How could there be a mortal in the Yunlun Mountain Range?</p><p>The scarred man Called Lei Zhou landed in front of Ye Xiaotian when he heard the voice. His expression was solemn as he carefully sized up the person in front of him.</p><p>He looked to be in his twenties, but he was only as tall as a teenager. He only reached his chest… if it was a teenager who had grown faster, he would probably be more than this height in his teens.</p><p>Lei Zhou narrowed his eyes and asked tentatively, “This… Sir, my brothers’ words just now were quite offensive. I apologize to you on their behalf. May I ask, who are you?”</p><p>He cupped his fists and bowed, but his gaze quickly fixed on the hexagonal crystal in Ye Xiaotian’s hand.</p><p>A treasure containing Holy Power was originally psychic and could not withstand restraint. Now that it had fallen into the hands of the person in front of him, it was as if it had returned to its original owner. There was no sign of struggle at all. It was very strange.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s eyes were still lowered. He only floated slowly in the air, allowing himself to be the same height as the people in front of him so that there was no need for him to look up at them. Then, he said indifferently, “I am Zhou Shen.”</p><p>Zhou Shen?</p><p>Lei Zhou and the others looked at each other and shook their heads, indicating that they had never heard of such a person in the Yunlun Mountain Range.</p><p>They knew Zhou Tianshen. After all, he had been at the top of the leaderboard before, but Zhou Shen…</p><p>Lei Zhou felt relieved and said with a chuckle, “Brother Zhou Shen, what I said earlier is still valid. Return this Holy Power treasure to me, and I will give you 50,000 points. How about it?”</p><p>Without waiting for the person in front of him to reply, Lei Zhou paused and added.</p><p>“Up until now in the Imperial City Trial, those who can survive are all great people. I, Lei Zhou, don’t like to make enemies unnecessarily. Instead, I prefer to make friends.</p><p>“Seeing that you dare to walk alone near the Nine Dragon Range, you must have something to rely on. To be honest, I, Lei Zhou, also can’t see through you…</p><p>“Since that’s the case, how about we meet by chance and give each other some face?”</p><p>The group of people behind him were a little noisy as if they were not satisfied with their boss’s attitude towards such an unarmed short man. However, Lei Zhou only raised his hand and stopped them from talking nonsense.</p><p>It was still the same old saying. To be able to survive until now in the Yunlun Mountain Range, other than being lucky, they were all capable people.</p><p>Lei Zhou did not think that he would encounter a lucky person by coincidence. Therefore, he believed that the person in front of him should have some of his very own skills.</p><p>If he could avoid evil, he would try his best to avoid evil. This was also one of the reasons why he, Lei Zhou, could survive until now.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian looked at the dozen or so people who had landed in front of him and started to covet the treasures that belonged to him, the resentment toward the “shorty” in his heart was erased by Lei Zhou’s good words.</p><p>Without leaving a trace, he glanced at the void without people by his side. Ye Xiaotian pondered for a moment, then suddenly waved the hexagonal crystal in his hand and said with a smile, “50,000 points, I’m afraid it’s not enough.”</p><p>Lei Zhou raised his eyebrows. Seeing that the person in front of him had an extraordinary temperament and was not shocked at all, he immediately suppressed the profanity of his brothers behind him and said.</p><p>“The Holy Power treasure is only worth 100,000 points. I, Lei Zhou, am willing to give you half of it. This is already giving you enough face, Brother Zhou Shen. If you want to ask for more…”</p><p>His words came to an abrupt end. He shook his head slightly and did not speak anymore. He thought that a wise person did not need to point out too much.</p><p>“We are not to be trifled with!” the brothers behind him could not suppress their anger anymore. They said angrily, “Shorty, don’t go too far!”</p><p>Lei Zhou’s face darkened. He suddenly turned his head and shouted, “All of you shut up!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
