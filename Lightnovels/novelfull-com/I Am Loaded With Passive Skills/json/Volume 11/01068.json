This was unable to fill her stomach completely.</p><p>“If you are called Zhou Shen, then you…” Rao Yaoyao’s gaze swept through them one by one and finally landed on Lei Xi’er. “How should I address you?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was as calm as ever, allowing the demonic wind on the cliff to brush past her silver-white hair. That strange and mysterious God Devil Eyes rotated faintly, and a faint revulsion was reflected in her eyes.</p><p>The Rao clan… Lei Xi’er did not make a sound.</p><p>She did not want to answer such a meaningless question.</p><p>Furthermore, she disdained to be like Xu Xiaoshou and Ye Xiaotian, who created a meaningless fake identity, even if it was to stall for time.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao raised her eyebrows in surprise, clearly sensing the silver-haired girl’s hostility towards her. She said, “You seem to hate me very much? Have we met before?”</p><p>The wind blew past. Lei Xi’er pursed her lips and did not speak.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had no choice but to come out and rescue her.</p><p>Although he did not know if there would be any reinforcements coming, he guessed that the ‘guidance’, which was suspected to be Bazhun’an’s, did not lead him to send them to their deaths.</p><p>Therefore, it was better to stall for some time now.</p><p>“Sword Deity Rao’s question is a little too much…”</p><p>One sentence from him took away Rao Yaoyao’s attention.</p><p>Seeing that the other party and all the law enforcers’ eyes were fixed on him, Xu Xiaoshou cleared his throat and pointed at Lei Xi’er. “This person is mute. She doesn’t know how to speak. Please forgive her.”</p><p>With a click, Lei Xi’er seemed to have been petrified. She stood there for a long time before she turned her head with difficulty. Her pupils became extremely deep as if they could swallow a person whole.</p><p>“Cursed, passive points + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>The inconspicuous Night Guardian, who was among the law enforcer team, suddenly closed his eyes and let out a long sigh from the bottom of his heart.</p><p>Ever since Xu Xiaoshou’s first few words came out, that familiar scent made him conclude that the person opposite him was 120% the one he had been looking for but could not find.</p><p>For a split second, Night Guardian fantasized about how good it would be if he was wrong this time and Rao Yaoyao was wrong as well?</p><p>However, it was only a split second before he came back to his senses.</p><p>The person opposite him was the enemy…</p><p>Looking at Xu Xiaoshou who was still stubbornly resisting, Night Guardian felt that the other party was powerless. He could not help but recall the scene of him inviting Xu Xiaoshou to the White Cave.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou had chosen to agree at that time, to join the red-clothed and to become a member of the Holy Divine Palace, perhaps there wouldn’t be such a situation where the two sides were at loggerheads.</p><p>“You were wrong in the end, Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt a strange aura from the edge of the cliff. using his “Perception”, he quickly saw the complicated expression that the Night Guardian sent him.</p><p>He smiled slightly to show his friendliness. He planned to take a step forward and draw everyone’s attention back to prevent Rao Yaoyao from paying too much attention to Lei Xi’er.</p><p>At this moment, the hunchbacked second brother, Wang Dachui, who had been silently observing, jumped out.</p><p>“If I’m not mistaken… with that Ultimate Life Demon Physique and God Devil Eyes, your surname should be ‘Lei’?” Although he was pointing at Lei Xi’er, his head was facing towards Rao Yaoyao’s direction.</p><p>Lei?</p><p>Upon receiving the information, Rao Yaoyao suddenly realized that this girl’s eyes were indeed somewhat special.</p><p>As for the Ultimate Life Demon Physique…</p><p>She didn’t doubt the judgment of the Chief of the Physique Division, but Wang Dachui’s prompt had reminded her of some of her previous speculations.</p><p>Some time ago, she thought that Mu Zixi, who was by Young Master Xu’s side, was the Ultimate Life Demon Physique, so she had sent Yi to probe.</p><p>It was this mission that sent Yi to the saint servant’s ambush and killed him.</p><p>When the word “Lei” appeared, Rao Yaoyao felt that her thoughts had been cleared even though the silver-haired girl opposite her did not admit or deny it.</p><p>Suddenly, many things could be linked together!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was suspected to be the demi-saint’s descendant, Young Master Xu, but the timing of his appearance did not match Young Master Xu at all. The two had appeared at the same time.</p><p>The silver-haired girl’s physique was very similar to Mu Zixi, who was by Young Master Xu’s side. However, after this meeting, Rao Yaoyao felt that they should be two independent people as there was no similarity between them at all.</p><p>In that case, the fact that she still fell into the trap of the saint servant and sent Yi into an ambush…</p><p>It was either due to the saint servant using the difference in the amount of identity information obtained by both sides, or he had used his “ever-changing” ability to direct blames on the demi-saint’s descendant, Young Master Xu and the people around him to make her suspicious of the young master.</p><p>Then, the saint servant used her suspicion and the unrelated Young Master Xu and Mu Zixi as lure to lead Yi into the fight.</p><p>There was no way to find a connection between the demi-saint’s descendant, Young Master Xu, and the saint servant, so she didn’t take it seriously or care about it at all, which led to Yi not taking any precautions in advance…</p><p>Was this how the saint servant took advantage of her ignorance and carelessness to trap and kill Yi in the Yunlun mountain range?</p><p>“There’s more!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao felt that her mind was getting clearer and clearer.</p><p>When Yi died, she speculated that he was attracted by something, which caused him to not choose to run away immediately.</p><p>The reason, “Yi ran into Xu Xiaoshou and wanted to take him down”, might make sense, but it was a bit far-fetched.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
