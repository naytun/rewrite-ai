In the middle of the sword wheel was the second-ranked blood sword on the famous sword list, the Bewitching Demon. With extreme vigilance, he landed on Lone Cliff.</p><p>After confirming that there were no dangers, special arrays, or ambushes on the mountain edge of the cliff, he nodded to the back, motioning his eldest senior brother to land on the cliff.</p><p>Gu Qingyi tapped his toes, and the evil sword Yuelian fell into his arms. He landed on the Lone cliff with a mixture of surprise and vigilance.</p><p>“There’s no one here…” Gu Qinger walked around the cliff and didn’t see anyone. He said with a slightly relaxed mood, “We are indeed the chosen ones. Only we have this kind of special guidance.”</p><p>Gu Qingyi was silent for a moment and then said with puzzlement, “It’s a little too quiet…”</p><p>“Since there’s no one, isn’t it normal for the area to be quiet? If there’s a sound, it would be like seeing a ghost,” Gu Qinger complained while taking out the saint origin crystal that he had just obtained.</p><p>“Eldest senior brother, this thing is what the Eighth Sword Deity claimed… the origin of Saint Ascension? How will it ascend me? If I eat it now, will I become a sword saint?” He asked.</p><p>Gu Qingyi glanced at him. “Are you planning to take over the role of the brainless one while our junior brother isn’t here?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Gu Qinger shook his head, put away the saint origin crystal, and curled his lips. “So there are times when eldest senior brother doesn’t understand too…”</p><p>Gu Qingyi couldn’t be bothered to argue with his junior brother.</p><p>The unusual silence around him made him very vigilant.</p><p>Because there were obvious signs of a fight on the cliff.</p><p>And yet, all of them had disappeared…</p><p>Gu Qingyi was on full alert. As he verified his thoughts, he walked to the edge of the cliff.</p><p>“Wu-”</p><p>The strange demonic wind whimpered year-round.</p><p>Gu Qingyi squatted down and rubbed the rocks on the edge of the cliff. His eyes lit up as he beckoned, “Come here.”</p><p>Gu Qinger immediately ran over and squatted down. “Eldest senior brother, what’s the matter?”</p><p>“I touched it.”</p><p>“I touched it. Then what?”</p><p>“What did you touch?”</p><p>“… Sword will?”</p><p>“Whose sword will?”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Gu Qinger was stunned for a moment. He realized that there was something strange about this sword will. After analyzing it seriously, he said in shock, “The sword will of the Eighth Sword Deity… this… is the remnant of the Great Buddha Chop?”</p><p>Gu Qingyi nodded. “That’s right. I suppose you can be considered to have made some progress. At least in the way of the sword, you haven’t been stupid before.”</p><p>Gu Qinger was still shocked. He thought of what his eldest senior brother had said just now and probed, “The Eighth Sword Deity is here?”</p><p>Gu Qingyi was silent for a long time. After a while, he said in a hoarse voice, “In terms of the brain, yours is still not working. This is clearly the place where the Eighth Sword Deity summoned the Sky City!”</p><p>“Oh, oh.” Gu Qinger didn’t know what could be studied from this discovery and he didn’t understand. “Eldest senior brother, what’s about it then?”</p><p>“Go down.” Gu Qingyi pointed at the bottom of the cliff.</p><p>Go down?</p><p>Gu Qinger was shocked.</p><p>The bottom of the cliff looked very dangerous. How could he go down?</p><p>He picked up a stone and threw it, but it didn’t echo for a long time… he didn’t know how to summarize this discovery.</p><p>“It’s unfathomable,” Gu Qinger said after holding it in for a long time.</p><p>“Do I need you to say that?”</p><p>Gu Qingyi thought as he glared at his junior brother and returned to the main topic. “That special guidance overlaps with our Supreme Master’s new guidance. Since there’s no answer at the edge of the cliff, I plan to go down and take a look.”</p><p>Gu Qinger’s face immediately turned bitter. “Eldest senior brother, there’s no need to take such a risk. If you fall off the cliff and your bones shattered…”</p><p>“Go back and look for junior brother. Protect junior sister with him. I don’t feel at ease with him alone,” Gu Qingyi said calmly.</p><p>“No, I’m not backing down. I just feel that it’s too dangerous to go down the cliff, but it might not be impossible to give it a try.” Gu Qinger understood his eldest senior brother’s intention to chase him away and immediately changed his words.</p><p>“I’m not chasing you away. I’m serious.” Gu Qingyi smiled, “We’re just trial-takers. We can go anywhere we want… If it wasn’t for junior brother’s incident that caused the law enforcers to issue a law against the ancient swordsman in time, this place wouldn’t be dangerous to us at all.”</p><p>“But it’s different down there!” Gu Qingyi pointed to the bottom of the cliff as he spoke, his voice sinking. “In a dangerous and unknown situation, I’ll go down first to investigate. Once there’s an opportunity, I’ll immediately call you guys over.”</p><p>“I’m not going back.” Gu Qinger’s head was like a rattle-drum. “Junior brother isn’t weak now. He has enough strength to protect junior sister alone. It’s too boring for me to go back.”</p><p>“Didn’t you also say that you wanted to protect junior sister previously?” Gu Qingyi’s face was full of amusement.</p><p>“That opportunity has been snatched away by him…” Gu Qinger silently ridiculed.</p><p>Gu Qingyi immediately laughed and shook his head, not saying anything more.</p><p>He thought about it again and looked at the sea of clouds on the cliff. He felt the unknown risks, however, his eyes were filled with determination.</p><p>“Since you’re not going back, you can stay here and wait for me so that you can take care of the situation if anything goes wrong.”</p><p>“Remember, don’t come down without my message, and don’t leave either.”</p><p>“If I’m not back within two hours, you… can send a message to our supreme master. Tell him that I’m going to die, and force him to come and save me.”</p><p>Gu Qingyi paused and looked at the bottom of the cliff. “I’ll be back soon.”</p><p>Ah?</p><p>Before Gu Qinger could finish his sentence, he saw his eldest senior brother leap into the sea of clouds on the cliff and started to fall freely.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
