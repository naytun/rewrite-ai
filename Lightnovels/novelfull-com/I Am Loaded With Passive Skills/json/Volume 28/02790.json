If you want to die, don’t drag Hidden Bitter down with you, this sword has such spiritual quality… Give it to me?”</p><p>Snap!</p><p>The invincible sword cognition suffered its first setback, torn into pieces by the golden dragon materialized from the will of Absolute Imperial Control after the Emperor Sword was unleashed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression grew solemn, this was the first time he had seen someone overpower the Penetrating Divine Senses with frontal attack methods.</p><p>“Execute!”</p><p>The Empress decreed, and the golden dragon lunged at him directly.</p><p>At the critical moment, Xu Xiaoshou instinctively thought to block with his sword horizontally, but sensing the trembling emotion of Hidden Bitter, realized this weapon’s quality might not suffice.</p><p>Therefore…</p><p>When facing such a high-level attack, when only the methods of an ancient swordsman could be used.</p><p>My first choice was also the Fourth Sword.</p><p>Hadn’t I relied on the notorious reputation of the Fourth Sword for a long time?</p><p>If I were Bazhun’an or Mei Siren, with only a broken sword in hand, how would this Emperor Sword Heavenly Unravel turn weakness into strength?</p><p>At the nick of time!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could only draw his sword, and around him bloomed the Green River Sword Borderline.</p><p>As Hidden Bitter followed, it transformed into a massive, sky-scraping blue greatsword.</p><p>In that instant, the advancing time of the golden dragon even slightly delayed.</p><p>“Three Streams of Red Plum Blossoms, Qingshi Sword!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Qingshi Sword, condensed from the entire Green River Sword Borderline and unleashed in a space-time breaking manner, fiercely chopped at the head of the Dual Phoenix Dragon’s right arm, the golden dragon.</p><p>“Lord Shou has gone mad!”</p><p>Outside the Arena, Feng Zhongzui’s hand trembled at the sight.</p><p>He had not yet continued to speak when in the next instant, everyone understood why.</p><p>“Snap!”</p><p>The Qingshi Sword cracked open.</p><p>Inside, Hidden Bitter violently shook, and even blasted a piece of black fragment from above the sword body.</p><p>“To counter force with force, this method is indeed good, but Hidden Bitter is too fragile—it’s not usually fragile, but it really can’t compare to Emperor Sword! Is Lord Shou intending to nurture a successor to the broken sword Qingju, this broken sword Hidden Bitter?” Feng Zhongzui’s eyes bulged.</p><p>Can’t endure…</p><p>Just that one touch, Xu Xiaoshou realized even the second stream of the Three Streams of Red Plum Blossoms couldn’t withstand the impact of the Emperor Sword Heavenly Unravel.</p><p>The others probably couldn’t either.</p><p>Too hard!</p><p>The man-sword unity of Bei Bei and the Emperor Sword elevated her combat strength to an extreme pinnacle.</p><p>Is this the power of “Perfect Heavenly Unravel”?</p><p>Retreat!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t bear to have Hidden Bitter just broken like this.</p><p>At the moment of the clash with the Qingshi Sword, he withdrew his sword on the spot.</p><p>But with this withdrawal, it wasn’t just the Qingshi Sword or Hidden Bitter that he pulled back, but also all the momentum that had been building up from the start!</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>The phantom of the golden dragon pierced through the chest immediately, spraying blood across the entire Emperor’s Palace.</p><p>Feng Zhongzui’s scream of shock timely resounded:</p><p>“He’s wounded!”</p><p>“They say even in Hallmaster Xuanji… Ouch, Old Family Head, don’t hit me!”</p><p>“Anyway, they say Lord Shou hardly ever gets made to bleed by someone, nowadays even some… oh, demi-saints completely fail against him.”</p><p>“For Hidden Bitter, he grimly took a hit from the Dual Phoenix Dragon himself, I love it… but, he will regret it!”</p><p>Within the Emperor Palace, Xu Xiaoshou groaned, glanced down and found the wound on his chest already healing…</p><p>At this moment!</p><p>He suddenly felt something amiss, his internal energy blood boiling rapidly, generating streams of golden sword energy.</p><p>The sword energy transformed within his body into myriad swords wreaking destruction, and finally was recalled by the massive Emperor Sword suspended above the pinnacle of the Emperor Palace…</p><p>“Xu xi!”</p><p>In the image of the Dao Imparting Mirror, Lord Shou erupted with countless golden sword energies, dragging with them a sky-</p><p>filled blood mist, returning to the colossal sword piercing the clouds above the pinnacle of the Emperor Palace.</p><p>This world sword phantom that broke through the clouds immediately solidified a bit more.</p><p>…</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou got injured?”</p><p>At this moment, in front of the Dao Imparting Mirror, Gu Qingyi, Qiao Qianzhi, Xiao Qixiu, Xin Gugu, Storyteller, and everyone else who was in good terms with Xu Xiaoshou all leaned forward, their faces tense.</p><p>This man, who even dared to tear apart the Holy Emperor Qilin, now that his combat strength was restrained, was he truly unable to handle the Emperor Sword Heavenly Unravel?</p><p>Is the Seven Sword Deity Bei Bei so terrifying?</p><p>“He underestimated the Emperor Sword and also the Heavenly Unravel…” Elder Gou murmured softly.</p><p>“Exactly, as a ruler of the white-clothed people, how could I be baselessly notorious?” Dao Qiongcang still instinctively stood on the side of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>Elder Gou silently glanced back at him.</p><p>Sometimes he genuinely couldn’t tell whether Elder Dao the Flamboyant was unconsciously satirical, or if he did it deliberately, or perhaps, it was his own sensitive nerves, overthinking something.</p><p>Of course, there was one last possibility…</p><p>This guy was inherently flamboyant, so much so that a simple sentence from him could be interpreted straightforwardly, or inversely, containing dual meanings, and not lacking in indirect criticism either.</p><p>“And you, how do you see it?” Dao Qiongcang didn’t pay attention to Elder Gou, cupping his hand around his breath, and glanced toward Bazhun’an…</p><p>In the end, he still turned his head, giving Elder Gou a cunning smile.</p><p>He was indeed doing it on purpose!</p><p>Elder Gou didn’t even bother to frown any more, following with a look towards the focused Bazhun’an.</p><p>Bazhun’an had been staring at the image in the Dao Imparting Mirror for a long time, his eyes somewhat dry and farsighted, after rubbing them, he rasped,</p><p>“He still lacks something and underestimated the heavenly solution of a famed sword.”</p><p>“But don’t forget, it has been just over a year since he debuted, and the strongest Heavenly Unravel he has seen is also Mr. Siren’s counterfeit.”</p><p>“You and the Voice of Nulan can’t unravel it, Mr. Siren and the Taicheng Sword don’t have enough compatibility, Rao Yaoyao trades sesame for watermelon, Xuan Cang utterly ignores her, and I’m even less capable now…we’re all useless.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
