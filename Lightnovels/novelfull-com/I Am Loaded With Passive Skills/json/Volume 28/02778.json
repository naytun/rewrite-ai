Is there anyone else who wishes to join us?”</p><p>Feng Tingchen breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>He did not want to make an enemy of Demi-Saint Ye. He was unsure how he had provoked such a formidable figure, but the situation was undeniably intimidating.</p><p>It would be best if everyone could take a step back.</p><p>“We’re old now, so we can only supervise the battle.”</p><p>“The Feng family will also send a young junior to Jade Capital City to handle important matters and deal with some trivial affairs.”</p><p>“Demi-Saint Ye, please take the three of us. We appreciate your effort.”</p><p>After Feng Tingchen finished speaking, he waved his hand downward, but no one appeared. His expression changed.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was not in a hurry and cast a curious glance.</p><p>Feng Tingchen turned back, offering an apologetic smile. “Feng Zhongzui.”</p><p>“Ah, here he comes, here he comes…”</p><p>A young figure in white robes then emerged from the Feng mansion.</p><p>He looked no more than fifteen or sixteen years old, strikingly handsome, with a slightly flushed face and wet, disheveled hair.</p><p>He wore a white shirt with a simple black belt tied around his waist. His chest was half-open, and the knot was crooked, indicating he had hastily dressed.</p><p>“Sorry, Elder Ye, Elder Yang, Elder Feng… Oh no, Old Family Head.”</p><p>The young man looked terrified and kept apologizing. “I was so eager to welcome Demi-Saint Ye that I went to bathe and change my clothes, which caused a delay. I will punish myself with three…”</p><p>Smack!</p><p>As he spoke, he slapped himself, covering his face and awkwardly correcting himself, “I’ll take one slap as punishment, haha.”</p><p>The slap was quite solid!</p><p>The young man’s mouth twisted, and four red marks appeared on his cheek.</p><p>Feng Tingchen, even from a distance, could smell the alcohol, and his face turned ashen.</p><p>The Demi-Saint had arrived in person and made it clear not to be negligent, yet this young man had been drinking!</p><p>It wasn’t about showing respect by bathing and changing clothes—it was clear he was trying to mask the smell of alcohol.</p><p>Feng Tingchen shot Demi-Saint Ye an apologetic look and then glanced at the wine pouch on the young man’s waist, anger rising in him. He was about to take action.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The Crane Sword, Tingchen trembled slightly.</p><p>The young man’s hands were slippery as if coated with oil. He quickly stashed the wine pouch he had almost forgotten into his spatial ring.</p><p>“Ahaha… Burp.”</p><p>The awkward laugh was meant to ease the tension, but he ended up burping.</p><p>Feng Zhongzui tried to cover his mouth, his nervous and grateful eyes darting around. He discreetly glanced at the old family head’s famed sword, took a deep breath, and tried to eliminate the alcohol smell.</p><p>“Well, it’s getting late.”</p><p>“Boss, please get moving. We can’t keep Master Siren waiting, can we?”</p><p>Feng Tingchen nearly drew his famed sword.</p><p>Feng Zhongzui pounced and hugged his leg while holding onto Crane Sword, Tingchen.</p><p>“Don’t…” he begged.</p><p>Feng Tingchen sighed deeply and turned helplessly.</p><p>“I am ashamed. Demi-Saint Ye must have seen this.”</p><p>“This child is the most talented of the younger generation in our Feng family, but he is also the most mischievous, often missing important matters.”</p><p>“If Demi-Saint Ye is offended by this, I will immediately replace him. He will not go to the Central Region this time!”</p><p>“Ah?” Feng Zhongzui panicked, clutching Feng Tingchen’s leg with one hand and grabbing Ye Xiaotian’s leg with the other. With tears streaming down his face, he pleaded, “Senior Ye, please give me a chance. I want to go to the Central Region. I have a promise… Uh, please, just give me a chance!”</p><p>As he spoke, he attempted to reach out with his foot towards Yang Xizhi, but with no success. He extended his leg, trying to hook Yang Xizhi’s feet.</p><p>Yang Xizhi, stroking his beard and watching the scene, took a step back, his expression turning solemn.</p><p>Unable to reach anyone, Feng Zhongzui sniffled and said, “Elder Yang, please say something for me. This is a rare opportunity. I was wrong. I won’t drink again…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian had been quite upset earlier.</p><p>In the entire Southern Land of Sin and Feng Family City, anyone who saw Demi-Saint Ye would bow and show respect.</p><p>This youth, reeking of alcohol, was extremely disrespectful. Despite his earnest words, there was no trace of respect in his eyes.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian had considered using this opportunity to express his anger and teach the Feng family a lesson, while also doing them a favor.</p><p>However, when he saw the youth daring to grab Feng Tingchen’s thigh with one hand and his thigh with the other, even trying to hook Yang Xizhi…</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was suddenly reminded of the Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>It felt like a certain fool who, after destroying the Tianxuan Gate, had held a bunch of Treasure of suppressing barrier and dared to hook the seal ring fallen right under his nose…</p><p>It was very similar!</p><p>Aside from the mismatched characters, the “vicious” feeling was the same.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian snapped out of his daze, waved dismissively, and asked, “What’s your name?”</p><p>“Feng Zhongzui!” The young man jumped up, wiped his nose, and proudly proclaimed, “I’m Feng Zhongzui, the most outstanding genius of the younger generation in the Feng family, the future successor to Crane Sword, Tingchen, and of course, the future head of the Feng family… Ow!”</p><p>Feng Tingchen gave the young man a sharp tap on the head with his sword, causing him to wince in pain. Finally, he sighed, “I apologize for making Demi-Saint Ye laugh.”</p><p>“It’s fine…” Ye Xiaotian said, gazing at the young man who, despite his pain and awkward stance, was still trying to look for something on the ground, feeling a pang of sympathy.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
