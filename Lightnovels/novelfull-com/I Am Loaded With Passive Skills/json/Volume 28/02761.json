Could these things really be passed down?</p><p>“You don’t have to help me.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen suddenly calmed down and stubbornly pushed Elder Yu away.</p><p>Her gaze shifted from her Supreme Master to Lei Xi’er’s God Devil Eyes, and then to Lei Shuangxing, whom she had met once when she was a child.</p><p>She looked at the black cloth covering his eyes and at his once complete face, which was now only white and had blurred facial features.</p><p>“Your face…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen wasn’t someone who liked to poke at people’s scars, but she just wanted to get the answers to all her questions.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing was as indifferent as ever. “I have my face on the Sacred Mountain. Your Supreme Master has also seen my face. Don’t worry. This is not their doing…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing continued, “Your Supreme Master is not so merciful. If she had captured me, she would have only scarred my face.”</p><p>The surroundings suddenly became deathly silent.</p><p>The distant Mei Siren couldn’t help but look away.</p><p>He couldn’t imagine what pain these children had experienced in the past and now, but they were so strong that it made his heart ache.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s hand trembled as she subconsciously reached for her spatial ring.</p><p>She wanted to apologize on behalf of her Supreme Master.</p><p>She had the Rejuvenation Pill.</p><p>However, she quickly stopped. How naive!</p><p>Would Lei Shuangxing not have a Rejuvenation Pill?</p><p>His face wasn’t caused by her Supreme Master or the person who had destroyed the Lei family. It was caused by him escaping from the pursuit.</p><p>Since that was the case, was it because he didn’t want to recover when he grew up?</p><p>No!</p><p>He always remembered this hatred on his face!</p><p>“The Lei family secretly plotted against the Abyss Island…”</p><p>Only at this moment did Yu Zhiwen realize how much weight her Supreme Master’s words carried.</p><p>“I’m sorry…”</p><p>She lowered her head in a trembling voice, tears streaming down her face.</p><p>She reached out to wipe away the tears on her face, but her tears flowed like a fountain and could not be stopped at all.</p><p>“Sorry, sorry…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen covered her face and cried, her shoulders trembling.</p><p>The blood from the nails in her palm mixed with the tears from her eyes, making her face dirty and smelly.</p><p>When a little salty bitterness came from the corner of his lips…</p><p>Suddenly!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s body trembled, and her eyes widened. She covered her face and wiped her tears, and her ten fingers bent as she stabbed straight at the Pearl Gem Star Eyes!</p><p>…</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Lei Shuangxing tightened his grip on the Divine-beating Crutch, lifted it with his heel, and stepped back.</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s God Devil eyes narrowed slightly, but she didn’t do anything.</p><p>Elder Yu was right beside his great-granddaughter!</p><p>However, the person closest to her was the one who could not react in time.</p><p>He watched as Yu Zhiwen cried and cried. Suddenly, her actions changed, and she wanted to dig out her eyes as an apology!</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Old Man Yu was numb.</p><p>He stretched out his hand, but it was too late…</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Among the people present, there was one who reacted the fastest and was always on guard. He chose to step in at the right moment.</p><p>The moment Yu Zhiwen calmed down, Xu Xiaoshou sensed that something was wrong.</p><p>According to Bei Huai…</p><p>Her divine soul suddenly lost its excitement.</p><p>Extreme emotional changes would inevitably lead to extreme changes in behavior.</p><p>Just as Yu Zhiwen was about to make a mistake, Xu Xiaoshou stretched out his hand and slapped Elder Yu, who was standing in front of her, away.</p><p>At the same time, he formed a palm with his fingers and pierced through space, blocking Yu Zhiwen’s path.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>This action of digging out the eyes was not a small one.</p><p>With both the recoil and the sharpness, Yu Zhiwen did not even touch her eyes. Instead, she only poked Xu Xiaoshou’s palm.</p><p>Her finger bones were broken, and blood splattered all over her face!</p><p>She was stunned, but she seemed to not feel the pain. She retreated out of Xu Xiaoshou’s defensive range and scratched her face again.</p><p>“Are you crazy?!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou flashed in front of Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>His left hand locked the girl’s two restless claws, and his right hand lifted her neck as if he were lifting a chick. He scolded her,</p><p>“What are you doing? Are you stupid?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen resisted and struggled. She had no face to look at this face that was so close to her. “Let go of me!”</p><p>“Let you go, and then you gouge out your eyes. I’ll help you put the Pearl Gem Star Eyes on Lei Shuangxing’s face,” Xu Xiaoshou sneered, getting right in their face. “Then, let’s also swap your blood with his. From now on, Lei Shuangxing will give up the Ancient Sword Technique and switch to Divine Secret… Oh, and he could also become your Supreme Master’s disciple, right?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s mind went blank. What was all this?</p><p>Lei Shuangxing’s mouth twitched at the same time. Was Xu Xiaoshou crazy?</p><p>“Criticized, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen opened her mouth, but before she could say anything, Xu Xiaoshou continued to curse,</p><p>“You can’t even do that?”</p><p>“Then return it to its original owner! Let’s be kinder. I’ll help you dig out your eyes, and you’ll dig out my junior sister’s.”</p><p>“I’ll put the Pearl Gem Star Eyes back on my junior sister’s face, and you’ll return the God Devil Eyes to Lei Shuangxing…That’s perfect! Then Lei Shuangxing will lend you his current pair of eyes.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s thoughts froze again, and her body stiffened as well. She stared at Xu Xiaoshou in disbelief.</p><p>“Surprised, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>This time, not only did Lei Shuangxing’s mouth twitch, but Lei Xi’er’s eyes also turned cold.</p><p>Everyone watching from the side was shocked. They didn’t expect that the ultimate villain wasn’t Dao Xuanji but Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t stop, his spittle even landing on Yu Zhiwen’s face, and he continued to deride,</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
