Had it spread?</p><p>Glancing from the corner of his eye, he also saw someone he knew.</p><p>Xin Gugu!</p><p>“Eh! Gugu, Lord Gu!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoji hurriedly called out a few times, finding an acquaintance in a foreign land was too good, especially since he seemed to be losing control.</p><p>But something terrifying happened…</p><p>No one perceived him at all!</p><p>Even Xin Gugu completely ignored his calls.</p><p>Upon closer thought, he had clearly bumped into many people, yet he passed right through them, as if suddenly he’d gone from a solid entity to a spiritual physique…</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>With this realization, Xu Xiaoji almost wanted to cry.</p><p>He held tight to a tree, trying to stop himself from flying off, but suddenly he embraced empty air and passed through Xin Gugu…</p><p>Oh no—</p><p>Swish swish swish!</p><p>Time was an illusion, and space was distorting.</p><p>Xu Xiaoji felt like he had traversed hundreds of miles in an instant, which was impossible; with his meager cultivation level, how could he have such speed?</p><p>But the fact was as such…</p><p>He was still traversing, still fleeing far!</p><p>“This direction?”</p><p>Seeing more and more golden osmanthus trees, Xu Xiaoji somewhat recollected; he should be heading in the direction of Jade Capital City.</p><p>Or in other words…</p><p>Jade Capital City, was something there summoning him?</p><p>“A ghost?”</p><p>“Ah, help, I’m so scared of ghosts!”</p><p>Time suddenly froze.</p><p>Coming from afar, the distorted figure of Xu Xiaoji in a flash saw such a scene.</p><p>It seemed not to be something he saw, but something “shared” by someone else:</p><p>In the scene, there were many ancient swordsmen with an air of immortality, many Spiritual Cultivators with awe-inspiring auras…</p><p>But what caught the eye most was the golden sword that blasted through the Emperor’s Palace, striking down towards a dark shadow below.</p><p>Such grandeur!</p><p>If only I could be like that, even for a moment, wouldn’t it be wonderful?</p><p>“Supreme Emperor Sword…”</p><p>Without reason, Xu Xiaoji could call out the name of the sword, though he had never seen it.</p><p>But as a crack formed in his memory, a flood of things came bursting out.</p><p>Not just the Supreme Emperor Sword, Xu Xiaoji also recognized the true names of the sabers in the hands of the three ancient swordsmen nearby:</p><p>Staff Sword Chou Shen, Crane Sword Ting Chen, Sword Tower’s Guarding Sword.</p><p>And there was more!</p><p>Mystic Sword Taicheng, it was there too?</p><p>Xu Xiaoji suddenly felt dazed, how could he have the thought “It’s here too”?</p><p>But in the next instant, he felt it truly was like an eagerly awaited reunion; if Buddha Sword Furious Immortal, Godhood Sword Xuan Cang were also present, they could have a “grand celebration” in their human world.</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>Their human world?</p><p>Xu Xiaoji was bewildered; am I not human?</p><p>At that moment, he started to doubt his own identity, and simultaneously, glimpses of Lord Shou’s speculations about his origins flashed through his mind…</p><p>No need to confirm it!</p><p>Xu Xiaoji’s vision blurred, and all these images disappeared, with the last being filled by a black sword.</p><p>This was…</p><p>The vicious sword, the Fourth Sword!</p><p>No…</p><p>It was me!</p><p>All memories awakened upon returning:</p><p>Just like being born from warmth, finding that first crack, and scrambling out into the White Cave;</p><p>Then learning to take human form, exit through a second crack, and arriving in the human world;</p><p>Later, drawn by the Fourth Sword’s aura, the true self, finding the key to break the seal, the Cardinal Wheel;</p><p>Finally binding to the new owner of Black Scabbard and the Fourth Sword, following the Guidance to the end, meeting Lord Shou, creating bonds in a process that mirrored the beginning.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
