Lord Shou gained widespread fame after cutting off Dao Xuanji.</p><p>At this time, it was best for them to retreat after succeeding. It was too irrational of him to charge into the Jade Capital City and the Sacred Mountain.</p><p>Rumors had already spread that Sleeveless, the Saint Servant, had entered the Ran Ming Ruins. The information from Flower Pavilion also mentioned that someone had seen Sleeveless’s Scarlet Scorched Hand in the ruins.</p><p>Therefore, if they were to charge up to the Sacred Mountain now, they could at most save one Zhu Yike.</p><p>However, what was there to save Zhu Yike?</p><p>At this moment, retreating was the wisest choice.</p><p>“Lord Shou is acting impulsive. Could it be the effect of the Blood World Pearl?”</p><p>Li Fugui looked to the south. The information he received said that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had been following Lord Shou.</p><p>However, once the entrance to Jade Capital City opened, he disappeared. Li Fugui believed that he hadn’t left but was hiding.</p><p>The Chaos of Jade Capital…</p><p>It really resembled the source of a world’s calamity, the guidance of death!</p><p>However, Li Fugui had complete confidence in Lord Shou.</p><p>Since Lord Shou dared to use the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, he definitely had prepared in advance.</p><p>It was hard for him to understand the deeper meaning behind Lord Shou’s actions. Just like how Lord Shou was on the fifth level and he, Li Fugui, was on the third level…</p><p>While he was thinking about this, Li Fugui suddenly saw Lord Shou, who had blown up Xuanji great array in the distance, bending down like a demon and laughing maniacally.</p><p>“Hahahaha! Hahahaha!”</p><p>“Run, run! I want to see where you can run to. Today, I must blow up this city!”</p><p>Li Fugui was stunned for a moment before running away.</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points +9999.”</p><p>“Condemned, Passive Points +9999.”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +9999.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>With just a laugh, the information bar popped up non-stop.</p><p>These people were so gullible. Did he seem that cruel? He, Xu Xiaoshou, was a good person…</p><p>“Passive Points: 82,814,429.”</p><p>After flaunting his power outside the city for a while, his Passive Points surged by over six million, rising from more than seventy million.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that after this battle, he might be able to break a hundred million.</p><p>Speaking of which, after the main body woke up, he rushed here without stopping.</p><p>He had wanted to spend the time he wasted while fighting and rely on his passive points to recover the time he wasted while sleeping.</p><p>At the very least, he would be able to resist the pressure of the Holy Divine Palace with an Upanishad Spiritual Cultivator.</p><p>Who would have thought…</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was actually afraid of the name ‘Lord Shou’ and fled before fighting!</p><p>Dao Xuanji was really just a younger brother…Uh, sister, he had tricked her out of the city in one move and cut off her!</p><p>So far, these tens of millions of passive points have not been used.</p><p>Why did Xu Xiaoshou dare to challenge Jade Capital City like this?</p><p>That was because he had figured it all out. This time, it just so happened to be the intermission period of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>Dao Qiong Cang of the Ten High Nobles was no longer there, nor was Ai Cangsheng.</p><p>The third emperor, Yan Wuse, was dead, and Wei Feng was sealed in the Black Water Stream. Dao Xuanji was just a younger sister.</p><p>There were only three of the four God Emissaries left, one was slacking off, one was retarded, and one was a shut-in.</p><p>As for the two cutting path rulers, the one from red-clothed people had entered, while the one from white-clothed people was only a baby. He wasn’t even a demi-saint…</p><p>What is there to fear?</p><p>If he didn’t attack the Sacred Mountain now, when would he have the chance to attack again?</p><p>When all of them were gathered, they could even invite Bazhun’an to fight together.</p><p>Bullsh*t!</p><p>If he didn’t give them a good beating now, to the point where they had to get a Holy Emperor to save the situation, his surname would not be ‘Xu’!</p><p>“Fang Wenxin!”</p><p>Looking back at the only demi-saint who was willing to fight, wanted to fight, but was still determined to fight, Xu Xiaoshou did not wait for his answer.</p><p>This person’s character was indeed worthy of recognition.</p><p>At the very least, the Blood Shadow Copper Coin had captured so many ghost beast souls, which meant that the higher-ups of the red-clothed people only had a few for research.</p><p>He had shouldered all of this. It was still unknown whether he could truly redeem himself, but his spirit was commendable.</p><p>However, he didn’t even have a definite answer. He couldn’t even compare to Yu Zhiwen. Xu Xiaoshou had waited for so long and finally understood.</p><p>It should be like this!</p><p>It was just as Bazhun’an had said in the White Cave.</p><p>In this world, there were very few people who dared to answer as bluntly as he did.</p><p>In the end…</p><p>If Fang Wenxin wasn’t afraid, why would he guard the Sacred Mountain in vain?</p><p>If he had no scruples, how could he still be a demi-saint?</p><p>If he dared to fight, he would either be dead by now, or at least reach the level of the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>Talent determined the bottom line.</p><p>Courage determined the upper limit!</p><p>What others did not dare to do, Xu Xiaoshou did.</p><p>Not only did he want to blow up the Jade Capital in front of Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, but he also wanted to do something big and take back Greedy the Cat Spirit!</p><p>“Whoosh!” Seeing the silent Fang Wenxin looking over, Xu Xiaoshou took out the Ghost Beast Contract from Caramel from the Apricot Realm.</p><p>At this moment, everyone was moved.</p><p>Fang Wenxin wasn’t the only one who could tell what it was.</p><p>Elder Yu, the invisible Zhong Yuanzi, and Yu Zhiwen, who had crawled back from the space debris, all recognized the ghostly contract.</p><p>Before everyone could speak, Xu Xiaoshou sighed and said,</p><p>“Elder Fang, you’re tired. It’s time to rest.”</p><p>“This is the era of the younger generation. The elderly should retire. There’s no need to continue fighting on the front lines. It’s not worth it.”</p><p>“And the answer you can’t give, the choice you can’t make, I’m young, I’m impulsive, I can give it for you, I can decide for you!”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou spoke, he opened the Ghost Beast Contract.</p><p>At this moment, Fang Wenxin’s pupils were trembling. He knew what Xu Xiaoshou had done.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen shouted anxiously.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
