He could not even leave a drop to feed the Imitator.</p><p>However, how could Xu Xiaoshou let the Holy Blood hatch the Divine Puppet after being hit by one move?</p><p>“Infernal Heavens!”</p><p>With a pull, all Holy Blood was ignited.</p><p>However, it was full of Holy Power and could not evaporate for a short time.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not think of evaporating. It was just a mark. He raised his head and shouted,</p><p>“Dragon Apricot!”</p><p>Jade Capital City, outside Dragon Melting Realm.</p><p>The Ancestral Tree Dragon Apricot Diagram that had been serving as the background suddenly lit up.</p><p>Previously, he had lost a gamble in the Apricot Realm. After he came out and recalled his betrayal, Ancestral Tree Dragon Xing was extremely ashamed.</p><p>His pride had fallen to its lowest ever.</p><p>Therefore, even after Xu Xiaoshou was revived, he wanted it to be the backdrop to set off the coolness of his debut…</p><p>Ancestral Tree Dragon Apricot agreed with tears in its eyes.</p><p>This was obviously not enough!</p><p>At this moment, hearing that Xu Xiaoshou wanted to borrow the power of the Ancestral Tree and only called out to “Dragon Apricot” instead of the “Senior Dragon Apricot” from before, his words were even less respectful…</p><p>Dragon Apricot was vexed to the core!</p><p>Not keeping its promise to protect the Apricot Realm to its best ability and being tempted by the Nine Sacrificial Osmanthus was the thing it regretted the most in its life.</p><p>It regretted so much to the point it was disgusted.</p><p>In the entire Shengshen Continent, there were two people he found the most disgusting. One was Dao Qiongcang, and the other was Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He hated two kinds of people the most. One was Divine Sorcerers, and the other was still Diving Sorcerers.</p><p>“Swoosh swoosh…”</p><p>It was fine to criticize it, but Dragon Apricot still did not want to disobey Xu Xiaoshou’s orders, who was currently in the limelight.</p><p>Countless golden lights fell from the sky, turning into Dragon Apricot branches that accurately pierced into the jade-gold Holy Blood.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>The energetic Holy Blood was suddenly sucked dry.</p><p>Seeing this, Xu Xiaoshou smiled.</p><p>He had no other way to deal with this Holy Blood. He was afraid that something might happen if he kept it, and it would be difficult to destroy it all in a short period of time.</p><p>However, Ancestral Tree Dragon Apricot was really not picky when it came to feeding. Dragon blood was the best, and Holy Blood was not bad either.</p><p>As expected, it ate everything in an instant!</p><p>With the Holy Blood gone and the female bodyguards gone, was the only one left not the half-sliced and powerless Dao Xuanji?</p><p>As for Elder Yu…</p><p>He did not even need to stop him.</p><p>Although this old fellow was filled with killing intent for some reason, he was just about to step forward when a golden and resplendent Dragon Apricot branch hung down in front of him.</p><p>Little Dragon Apricot was expressing its goodwill again, taking the initiative to retreat…</p><p>“Whoa.”</p><p>The wind moved slightly.</p><p>Mei Siren also appeared in the Dragon Melting Realm.</p><p>He lowered his head and held Taicheng behind his elbow with his left hand. He waved his folding fan with his right hand and said nothing.</p><p>On the fan, the four big words had changed:</p><p>“Hold it right there.”</p><p>Elder Yu was startled.</p><p>Fang Wenxin, who followed behind him, was also stunned.</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi was not startled, because he turned around and touched the flames of the Dragon Melting Realm. He was blowing at white flame, whose fingertips were hurting.</p><p>The two Saints in front no longer had the elegant interest of studying during this battle. They both recalled the fan they had seen when they were controlled.</p><p>“It’s just mediocre.”</p><p>With a whoosh, their anger soared. The two Saints said in unison,</p><p>“Ancient Swordsman, get lost!”</p><p>Swish.</p><p>Not only did Mei Siren not leave, but he also flipped his fan and stroked his beard without saying anything.</p><p>“Take it easy.”</p><p>…</p><p>Boom!</p><p>In the Arena separated by the branches of Dragon Apricot, a crazy battle suddenly broke out.</p><p>Both sides seemed to be fighting for real, and the level of the battle was getting higher and higher. The aftershock could actually pass through the protection of the Ancestral Tree Dragon Apricot’s branches.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s “Perception” swept across the area and saw two furious demi-saints, as well as Master Siren, who was dodging left and right.</p><p>With a glance, when he saw the paper fan that was the first to be sent flying, he understood something…</p><p>If Dao Qiongcang was said to be ostentatious, then the ancient swordsmen were all reserved, except for themselves.</p><p>Disgusting people also had a way.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to look any longer and returned to the two halves of Dao Xuanji’s body.</p><p>Within it, life force was surging. The divine path pattern was actually repairing itself, trying to connect and come back to life.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>He released his hands and countless spirit threads shot out from his palms, piercing into Dao Xuanji’s acupuncture points.</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s body trembled, and his eyes became extremely complicated. There was hatred, unwillingness, and humiliation…</p><p>This was a great humiliation!</p><p>Losing power, Xu Xiaoshou started to snowball. He did not give her any space to continue casting spells and took her down directly.</p><p>This suffocating feeling of being entangled by a python, the methods that were linked from one arm to the sword, and the calculations that were made step by step from the city to the outside…</p><p>For some reason, Dao Xuanji thought of Dao Qiongcang, and the resentment in her eyes became even stronger.</p><p>“Give up!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou flicked his finger and controlled the Divine Sorcerer with the method of a Divine Sorcerer, the Puppet Manipulation Thread.</p><p>After the night at Qingyuan Mountain and the baptism of Elder Dao the Flamboyant, he was too well-prepared to defend against the Divine Sorcerer.</p><p>After all, it was just a small incident. He wanted to save Xiang Yaoyao in the Jade Capital City, but in the end, not only did he fail to save her, but his house was almost robbed.</p><p>Just a little more and the main body in the Apricot Realm would have been captured…</p><p>How could Xu Xiaoshou not be frightened? How could he not be on guard?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was unpredictable. He could even scheme against his second true body and predict Independence. He even used the “Collection of Excuses” to create a time difference and leave a mark on him. In the end, he used this to target his main body and was ridiculous enough to descend into the Apricot Realm…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
