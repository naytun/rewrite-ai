It was also Greedy the Cat Spirit’s Body of Devour that was like a bottomless pit.</p><p>It constantly absorbed its own Life force!</p><p>“I didn’t sign a contract with you to become your tonic. Little Fat Cat, wake up!”</p><p>Weng!</p><p>Beneath his feet.</p><p>The Life Dao Disc spiraled and expanded and he entered directly into the Unity of Man and Heaven state.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>He controlled the Feast, the Breathing Technique, and even transcended to try to control Greedy the Cat Spirit’s Body of Devour!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sucked in countless spiritual energy and vitality from Heaven and earth to nourish himself.</p><p>This time, he could clearly sense…</p><p>The quantity had exceeded the limit!</p><p>The majority of this feeding force came from the Body of Devour!</p><p>“The contract was successful?”</p><p>“I am able to control Greedy the Cat Spirit’s Body of Devour to help in my recovery?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was overjoyed.</p><p>However, he still paid close attention to Greedy the Cat Spirit and its subconscious act of draining his Life force.</p><p>“No, it’s not very good, but it’s at least partially successful.”</p><p>“What’s left could be a little difficult to deal with…”</p><p>“But it’s not like there’s no other way!”</p><p>As long as it was within the plan, Xu Xiaoshou would rarely do something he was not confident in, just like the contract he just signed.</p><p>This was not due to impulsiveness, nor was it entirely because of Fang Wenxin. It was because he had planned it beforehand.</p><p>After he ripped apart the Holy Emperor Qilin in the Central Yuan World, Xu Xiaoshou realized how high the limit of the Ultimate Giant was.</p><p>However, the threshold for this second awakened skill was also too high.</p><p>Therefore…</p><p>As he slept, Xu Xiaoshou thought of this and had an idea:</p><p>If the problem of ‘not able to make ends meet’ was resolved and allowed the Ultimate Giant to maintain its usual activation, how much higher would its combat strength be?”</p><p>“A peak demi-saint or even a low level Holy Emperor?”</p><p>“I don’t know if I were to fight with the actual body of a Holy Emperor, but at the very least, I won’t be so hard-pressed when I need to fight against the thought incarnation of a Holy Emperor…”</p><p>“Then! How can we solve the problem of this ‘not able to make ends meet’?”</p><p>When he first entered the Sovereign Stage after the system evolved, Xu Xiaoshou obtained ten Great Dao Discs.</p><p>In addition to the Great Dao Discs of body, spirit and mind, this provided some support to the body, but it was very limited.</p><p>There was only one Life Dao Disc that focused on recovery and vitality!</p><p>“If I light up the Life Dao Disc and activate it to the level of the true Life Upanishad, will my recovery power be able to offset the consumption of the Ultimate Giant?”</p><p>“Even if it’s still not possible, the Ultimate Giant will still have to break through its upper limit. It will have to use its Penetrating Divine Senses, and even the Weaving the way of the Heavens in its giant state…”</p><p>“Then we should fight to support the war!”</p><p>“However, it’s clearly not enough to just rely on the ‘Breathing Technique’ and the ‘Feast’. I still need something bigger…”</p><p>“It should be as big as the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. You can get an Indestructible Body when you defeat Ye Xiao. You can also be reborn after you self destruct. It’s a perverted thing that’s close to the infinite recovery flow and that meant…”</p><p>“Body of Devour!”</p><p>It was impossible for Xu Xiaoshou to take possession of Greedy the Cat Spirit’s Body of Devour.</p><p>He was not a child either. He could only choose between the two.</p><p>I want them all!</p><p>The Life Dao Disc and the Body of Devour!</p><p>The bottom layer would self replenish and when it was not enough, it would devour others and transform them into its own and complete the normal activation of the Ultimate Giant!</p><p>In this way, even if the demi-saints of Jade Capital City returned, they might not even need to run. They could directly charge up the Sacred Mountain and save Elder Sang…</p><p>This was a bold idea.</p><p>And now, Xu Xiaoshou had made it happen.</p><p>Not only did he manage to successfully contract with Greedy the Cat Spirit, but he also wanted to make Greedy the Cat Spirit work for him and resolve any problems with the Ultimate Giant.</p><p>However, before that, he had to first get rid of its ‘Owner devouring’ nature-who knew where it had learned that from!</p><p>Of course Xu Xiaoshou would not go all the way to solve the root of the problem of Greedy the Cat Spirit.</p><p>Since Greedy the Cat Spirit wanted to devour, he would simply fulfill its desire. He wanted to see if there was a limit to the bottomless pit of the Body of Devour!</p><p>“Profound Dao Seed: 100000 Passive Points.”</p><p>“Passive Points: 83128840.”</p><p>One Profound Dao Seed, 100,000 Passive Points.</p><p>Based on the previous experience when it came to the accrual of points, it could increase the progress of the Great Dao Disc by about 1%.</p><p>Even if it would exceed the limit in the future, the speed of the experience bonus might also slow down with the accumulation of experience…</p><p>I have 80 million Passive Points. Theoretically, it can bring me eight mature Power Upanishad Formation. I don’t believe that I can’t produce a Life Upanishad!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was ruthless. He opened the Profound Dao Seed and smashed it onto the Life Dao Disc.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>“Let’s see if Greedy the Cat Spirit has a bigger appetite, or if I, Xu Xiaoshou, have a bigger one. Charge!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
