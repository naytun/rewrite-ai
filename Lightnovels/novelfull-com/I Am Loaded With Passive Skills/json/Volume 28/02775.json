All we need is a little push… And that push just so happens to be within our power to provide, to bring over the representative of the Feng family.”</p><p>As soon as the words were spoken, everyone turned their heads, simultaneously realizing something.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian could feel countless gazes from above and below the city walls focused on him, and he felt completely numb.</p><p>Wait a minute…</p><p>He thought, “I’m Ye Xiaotian! A demi-saint! I came here to protect Jade Capital City. That much is understandable. Saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda.</p><p>“But now, you want to use me as a teleportation portal that can cross regions without any time difference and cost no money? Are you still human?”</p><p>“I refuse,” Ye Xiaotian said, his face ashen.</p><p>A Saint cannot be humiliated, and the Spatial Upanishad wasn’t meant to be used in such a way.</p><p>Mei Siren paid no mind to Ye Xiaotian’s rejection and turned his attention to Xu Xiaoshou. Without giving him a chance to speak, he explained to everyone present, “Once the Saint War truly breaks out, the ones who will suffer the most casualties will be the common citizens of Jade Capital City.”</p><p>“Elder Zhong, Elder Fang, Elder Yu, and I have all held back because of this.”</p><p>“But the most distressed one is Demi-Saint Ye, who has protected Jade Capital City for a day and a night, saving countless lives. He is truly compassionate. He must be the most unwilling to see these tragedies happen!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s eyelids twitched violently as he listened. Under the stares of the crowd, his chest seemed to have been forcibly puffed out a bit. Despite his small stature, he appeared rather imposing.</p><p>He inwardly cursed, “How annoying! Ancient swordsmen are so annoying! I’ve been vexed by them ever since the days at Tiansang Spirit Palace, and it’s not without reason…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s lips gradually curled into a grin.</p><p>“Hallmaster Xuanji has already been killed by you. If there are any doubts about the Lei family, we can discuss them later…”</p><p>Mei Siren’s gaze shifted from Xu Xiaoshou to Lei Shuangxing and Lei Xi’er. After nodding slightly, he looked around at everyone and continued, “I ask for a favor from all of you.”</p><p>“The battle between the Sword Deity will replace the Saint War. The outcome will determine the honor and disgrace for both sides.”</p><p>“No matter what the result of this battle is, I, Demi-Saint Ye, Elder Yu, Elder Fang, Elder Zhong, and the other Saints should all keep the continent in mind. We must refrain from further action to avoid widespread suffering.”</p><p>“Are you all willing to agree to this?”</p><p>Before the Saints could react, the people of Jade Capital City were deeply moved.</p><p>From the moment Lord Shou arrived, he threatened to blow up the city, massacre the city, and even fight his way up to the Sacred Mountain. He was even crazier than Wei Feng, the God of Killing.</p><p>Hallmaster Xuanji wasn’t a good person either. In her eyes, the lives of ordinary people were no different from those of ants.</p><p>If they could back down, they would.</p><p>But if it came down to it, she would still crush them.</p><p>Only Mei Siren, only this Master Siren, treated people as human beings and cared about the lives of the people below!</p><p>He truly deserved to be called “Sir”!</p><p>“I agree,” Lei Shuangxing said after a brief telepathic communication with Lei Xi’er.</p><p>Elder Yu and Elder Zhong raised their hands at the same time. “No objections.”</p><p>Fang Wenxin glanced at Xu Xiaoshou, who had transformed into a ghost beast. He frowned but didn’t speak immediately. After a moment, his ears twitched. “Agreed.”</p><p>He wondered if he could represent the Holy Divine Palace in such a big matter.</p><p>Seeing that the three Saints on her side had agreed, Beibei didn’t dare act rashly.</p><p>A demi-saint could agree not to take action, but she did not have the authority to make such a decision on behalf of Hallmaster Xuanji.</p><p>Because if another order came down to continue the battle, should she obey the command of Xuanji Hallmaster or Master Siren?</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Beibei hesitated, and at that moment, her ears twitched. The voice of Hallmaster Xuanji came through, “Agree with him.”</p><p>In an instant, many thoughts flashed through Beibei’s mind.</p><p>Knowing the temperament of Hallmaster Xuanji, this was probably just a delaying tactic. Surely, she would resume the fight later.</p><p>Beibei remained hesitant.</p><p>An even more solemn voice came through her ear again, “Agree with him!”</p><p>Beibei had no choice. “I agree.”</p><p>…</p><p>Just as Bei Huai had taught, after a few voices of agreement, Xu Xiaoshou could see the souls of two people boiling with rage.</p><p>Fang Wenxin and Beibei.</p><p>They didn’t agree on their own. They seemed to have been forced into it.</p><p>It was a pity that he didn’t manage to control the Xuanji great array in time to block any possible telepathic communication…</p><p>Master Siren looked at him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to view all these developments with naive idealism.</p><p>Dao Xuanji would surely betray them as soon as reinforcements arrived…</p><p>Although the three Saints, Gu Yu, Zhong Yuanzi, and Fang Wenxin, had agreed for now, if there were orders to be passed down later, they would still have to obey…</p><p>This verbal agreement, though seemingly endorsed by multiple demi-saints, upon closer examination, was nothing more than a thin piece of paper that could easily be torn apart.</p><p>Even if Master Siren had put it this way…</p><p>Should he agree?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised both his hands and even lifted a foot. “Master Siren, whatever you say, I agree with both hands and feet!”</p><p>Was Master Siren naive?</p><p>No, he was an old fox, well aware of every angle.</p><p>This agreement could be broken later, but in front of everyone’s eyes, it would create a reputation for justice.</p><p>If everyone truly adhered to this reputation later on, then all would be well.</p><p>But if, in the future, the Holy Divine Palace were to lose and then try to break the agreement, it would be Xu Xiaoshou who could act with moral authority.</p><p>Of course, he wouldn’t massacre a city. Xu Xiaoshou had always used such threats as a bluff, never intending to follow through.</p><p>However, exposing their true nature by claiming the mantle of righteousness, was the sort of thing Xu Xiaoshou enjoyed doing.</p><p>At that moment, his mind was filled with countless creative ideas for dealing with the dirty side of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>“In that case, great,” Mei Siren said.</p><p>He smiled warmly as he saw everyone respect him. He then turned to Ye Xiaotian, his smile deepening.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
