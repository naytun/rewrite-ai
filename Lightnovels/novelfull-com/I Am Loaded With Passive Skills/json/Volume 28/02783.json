It looks like just an ordinary spiritual sword… Fourth grade? Third grade? It certainly is expensive, but does it befit the distinguished status of Lord Shou?”</p><p>“Where is Xu Xiaoshou’s Fourth Sword? And the Flame Python? An ordinary spiritual sword would probably break upon contact with the Supreme Emperor Sword, so is he joking around with this lousy sword?”</p><p>“Not at all, I’ve heard that Lord Shou used Hidden Bitter to slay Sword Saint Rao; Hidden Bitter is no ordinary item, it transforms into a serpent upon encountering storms!”</p><p>“Pfft! A fine serpent, but I remember he used the Fourth Sword back then?”</p><p>“Bullshit! I saw it with my own eyes; he used the Flame Python, the Flame Sword Python, combined with the Infernal White Flame. That is Lord Shou’s exclusive saber!”</p><p>“Gentlefolk, stop quarreling, maybe Lord Shou is nurturing his sword. Haven’t you seen Qingju emerge just like that, nourished by its ‘name’?”</p><p>“Ridiculous! Do you think any old sword has the grace of Qingju, or just anyone has the elegance of the Eighth Sword Deity?”</p><p>“Hidden Bitter? I’ll make a bold prediction—Broken Hidden Bitter!”</p><p>Before the great battle began, Xu Xiaoshou vaguely saw the Dao of heaven and earth, from all directions, wafting towards him whisps of “Qi” like silken fog.</p><p>These qi eventually drifted into Hidden Bitter’s sword body, causing it to become even more disheartened and its fighting spirit to wane even further.</p><p>Far from the earlier stance of defiance.</p><p>After touching the Supreme Emperor Sword, its spirit weakened once it softened.</p><p>“Name…”</p><p>Perception swept the four corners, yet nobody made a move on its behalf.</p><p>Only Brother Shuangxing seemed to sense something, stretching a finger to touch something in front of him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou instantly understood.</p><p>This was the “name” that could nourish all things, visible only to those who had practiced the Witness Sword Technique and cultivated “sword cognition.”</p><p>However, names achieved upon completion could forge Bazhun’an and Qingju, whereas names of decline and doubt seemed only to have the opposite effect, offering no nourishment to Hidden Bitter.</p><p>“Not so.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stood still in the air, pensive.</p><p>These nearly substantive “names” coming from the five regions, if he should ultimately face defeat, might indeed render Hidden Bitter unable to recover.</p><p>But if he won!</p><p>All doubts would then be empty.</p><p>And after reaching the point of no return, they would become the foundation for Hidden Bitter’s leap from fish to dragon, its success and reputation.</p><p>“In the dark past before you achieved your names, I was like this, and thus the origin of your name ‘Hidden Bitter’.”</p><p>“Besides, currently, you are merely a mere Grade Three spiritual sword, right?”</p><p>“Are they wrong to doubt you?”</p><p>With silver sword cognition shining in his eyes, Xu Xiaoshou murmured while his fingers lightly caressed the sword body of Hidden Bitter.</p><p>The black sword hummed and trembled, swiftly emitting satisfied moans, and in the blink of an eye, it forgot all external skepticism.</p><p>Fight!</p><p>“Ying—”</p><p>The Ying Sword tensed, rigid and straight.</p><p>Sword cognition ebbed and flowed between the swordsman and the saber, growing incessantly, and flashing a devouring brilliance.</p><p>Beibei’s gaze shifted from that black sword without acting first. Instead, she advised:</p><p>“You only have one chance. Change back to the Fourth Sword now, and it won’t break… This is not how you nurture a sword.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, however, lifted his eyes with a serene smile, “This is how I came to be.”</p><p>“Fine! Be bold and have no regrets!” Beibei exclaimed sharply as the Supreme Emperor Sword suddenly erupted with dazzling golden light.</p><p>She knew well Xu Xiaoshou’s level of swordsmanship and never took it lightly.</p><p>Since warnings were futile, going all out was the ultimate respect for one’s opponent!</p><p>“Ten Thousand Sword Technique…”</p><p>With palms opening, the Emperor Sword within vibrated madly, gradually elevating, and its aura rose layer by layer.</p><p>The fight was on just as soon as the stance solidified, combat erupting without delay!</p><p>The citizens of Jade Capital City, immersed just a breath ago in Lord Shou’s Lip Spear, Tongue Sword, suddenly found every spiritual sword in the entire city airborne.</p><p>“Hum hum hum…”</p><p>All Swords to the Master.</p><p>This was truly the thousands of swords that worshipped him.</p><p>Not the Void Solidifying Sword Technique, but the real swords of Jade Capital City!</p><p>“First level, Absolute Imperial Control?”</p><p>Holding tightly to Hidden Bitter, which was also being drawn in, Xu Xiaoshou looked askance, yet didn’t immediately intervene.</p><p>As a psychological high-placer, he indulged Beibei because he was certain she couldn’t beat him.</p><p>As someone beneath the Ten Thousand Sword Technique, he sought to learn from Beibei. He needed her to unleash her swordsmanship fully.</p><p>“Way of the Sword Disc.”</p><p>Without hesitation, Xu Xiaoshou stepped on the Way of the Sword Disc and concurrently entered the Unity of Man and the Heavens status.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
