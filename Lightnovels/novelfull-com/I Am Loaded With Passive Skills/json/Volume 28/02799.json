Xu Xiaoshou put on an innocuous smile and waved:</p><p>“Hello everyone, I’m Xu Xiaoshou meow~”</p><p>The waving stopped abruptly as Lord Shou’s smile froze.</p><p>Every person in front of the Dao Imparting Mirror froze as well, thinking it was an auditory hallucination.</p><p>Even Feng Zhongzui, who was within an arm’s reach, got goosebumps from what he heard.</p><p>…Meow?</p><p>Ancient swordsmen never doubt themselves.</p><p>Feng Zhongzui gave “Lord Shou” a skeptical look, his mouth curling into an awkward smile as he uttered:</p><p>“Lord Shou, how adorable?”</p><p>Sensing the murderous intent forming around him, Feng Zhongzui quickly changed the subject, speaking very quickly:</p><p>“The first battle of the Seven Sword Immortals has captured the world’s attention. Lord Shou, you have defeated Sword Deity Bei to take the stage. What do you feel right now?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath, fiercely warning Greedy the Cat Spirit within him that had calmed down but then came out again to cause trouble, especially in front of the public.</p><p>“Heh heh.”</p><p>He then put the smile back on, continuing to wave at the mirror:</p><p>“Actually, it’s nothing much, I was just a bit lucky and narrowly defeated Beibei by a hair meow…”</p><p>The words hung in the air, and he stopped waving again, his expression gradually growing stiff.</p><p>“Ah haha.” Feng Zhongzui chuckled awkwardly, his gaze shifting, thinking that “meow” was Lord Shou’s verbal tic, and he joined in:</p><p>“Lord Shou, you’re too modest meow, being too modest is insincere meow, how about some honesty meow?”</p><p>I’ll meow your head off!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou really wanted to lop off this guy’s head with a sword, his mouth twitching as he warned Greedy the Cat Spirit once again fiercely…</p><p>“Honest words?” He glanced back towards Beibei and said, “It’s nothing much.”</p><p>Good!</p><p>Feng Zhongzui’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Not just him, but viewers from every corner of the five regions held their breath at this moment, expecting juicy details.</p><p>Who wants to hear nonsense?</p><p>What everyone wanted were these explosive details!</p><p>Soon, Feng Zhongzui, who loved to stoke the flames, glanced at the family head and resumed his questioning:</p><p>“This generation of Seven Sword Immortals has rankings, and as the last-seated among them, Lord Shou, you have defeated Sword Deity Bei, ranked a notch higher.”</p><p>“May I ask, do you have any words for the Feng family in the Southern Region, who established the new rankings for the Seven Sword Immortals?”</p><p>Feng Tingchen felt a sudden surge of anger at the question, almost drawing the Crane Sword to chop down Feng Zhongzui.</p><p>Are you sick?</p><p>Aren’t you a member of the Feng family?</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou paused for a moment, questioning if he truly bore the Feng surname.</p><p>“Meow!” Before he could speak, Greedy the Cat Spirit, after taking part in a great battle, excitedly cried out again from within.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickly spoke up, trying to overpower the cat’s meow coming from his throat:</p><p>“I actually quite recognize the Feng family’s ranking, after all, when I was at Yunlun Mountain Range, I indeed relied on external forces meow…”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui winked, tilted his mouth and chuckled, “Lord Shou, don’t hesitate to tell the truth meow?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
