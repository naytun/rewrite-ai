His mind was controlled, which triggered the Spirit Awakening.</p><p>By the time he reacted, Fang Wenxin had already jumped above Greedy the Cat Spirit’s head.</p><p>The nine Blood Shadow copper coins spun around him rapidly. He closed his eyes and chanted something. Suddenly, he spat out a mouthful of blood essence and sprinkled it on the copper coins around him.</p><p>“Thousand Ghost Soul Capture, imperial order!”</p><p>With this shout, the color immediately faded from the sky.</p><p>When everyone regained their senses and looked back, they saw tens of thousands of ghost beast phantoms in the sky behind Fang Wenxin.</p><p>These ghostly beasts used their hands filled with ghostly energy to pull Greedy the Cat Spirit’s head as they tried to extract its soul.</p><p>Among the ghost beasts, there were lions and tigers, dragon pythons, tree monsters, and elves…</p><p>Some of them had physical bodies of the living creatures that humans knew.</p><p>Some of them were in the form of elements, sound waves, or a strange seven-colored ball…</p><p>Everything that should be there was there!</p><p>Everything that shouldn’t be there, the Blood Shadow copper coins had it too!</p><p>Tens of thousands of ghost beast phantoms pressed down, and the world was like a mirror that was about to be crushed. How similar was this scene to the appearance of the Inner island of the Abyss Island?</p><p>“Ghost beast…”</p><p>“They are all ghost beasts!”</p><p>That shocking scene was too terrifying.</p><p>Someone in Jade Capital City could not resist the oppressive power of the Power of Demons and Beasts and fainted.</p><p>“Stop…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wanted to stop him.</p><p>It was obvious that Fang Wenxin had released all the ghost beasts in the Blood Shadow copper coins.</p><p>His intention was probably to suppress Greedy the Cat Spirit with his Great Psionic Weapons like those ghost beasts.</p><p>However, at first glance, the scene was horrifying.</p><p>When he looked over again, Xu Xiaoshou saw even more!</p><p>After they wreaked havoc filled with ghostly energy and monstrous resentment, the ghost beast spirits filled the sky…</p><p>Once they turned to look at Fang Wenxin, one could actually see the gratitude in their eyes!</p><p>“Gratitude?”</p><p>At a certain moment, Xu Xiaoshou thought that he was seeing things.</p><p>Did the spirits of the ghost beasts suppressed within the Blood Shadow copper coins actually feel grateful toward Fang Wenxin?</p><p>What kind of perverted mentality was this?</p><p>However, he was not stupid. At the same time, he trusted his eyes and intuition. He immediately thought deeper into the matter…</p><p>“Swish.”</p><p>Elder Yu appeared in front of Greedy the Cat Spirit and faced Xu Xiaoshou from afar. It seemed that he would dare to kick Xu Xiaoshou if the latter made any strange movements.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou flashed away, but he didn’t appear in front of Greedy the Cat Spirit. Instead, he went over to Master Dean’s side.</p><p>He was curious.</p><p>He wanted to see if Fang Wenxin could suppress Greedy the Cat Spirit, who possessed the power of space, time, the Penetrating Divine Senses and the power of the ancestral source.</p><p>He wanted to verify his own guesses- about Fang Wenxin, the phantom copper coins, and even the first generation of the red-clothed people!</p><p>“Ta.”</p><p>He reached out and placed his hand on the weapon prohibition order.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s body was currently covered with dozens of weapon prohibition orders. It seemed as if he was even more powerful than Kui Leihan.</p><p>“Haha, how was it?”</p><p>The demi-saint with the Spatial Upanishad power seemed somewhat embarrassed.</p><p>But he was extremely strong… He forced out an expression that said, “Kid, you’ve finally grown up. My long journey here to save you was not in vain.” He looked at the senior disciple of the Outer Yard of the Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not say anything. He quietly probed the power of the weapon prohibition order.</p><p>He quickly read up on the power of forbidden spells; the extremely pure Power of Divinity, the Sealing Power that was very similar to Feng Yujin’s ability, and many other special powers that he did not recognize but had reached the level of the Holy Emperor…</p><p>These forces were mixed and intertwined, but they were also clearly separated. They seemed to have fused together, but each of the ‘stitcher’ had their own ideas and wisdom.</p><p>“Under normal circumstances, there is no solution.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked seriously at Master Dean. He didn’t explain how advanced or special this weapon prohibition order was. He only gave a conclusion.</p><p>“I know your style.” Ye Xiaotian said with a warm smile. “You like to do things in an abnormal way…”</p><p>“It will hurt a little.”</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was startled and had a bad feeling.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have transformed into Greedy the Cat Spirit. After he bent over, he took a snort of the weapon prohibition order around his neck as if he inhaled drugs.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>The weapon prohibition order suddenly lit up.</p><p>The power of the Path Principles and the Element power disappeared.</p><p>There seemed to be no process at all. It was all absorbed into Xu Xiaoshou’s energy reserve and body by this Breathing Technique.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A mass of violent destructive energy exploded in front of Ye Xiaotian.</p><p>This was the result of the various Holy Emperor powers being disrupted by the destruction of the weapon prohibition order.</p><p>“F*ck…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
