She knew where that strange feeling came from and quickly retracted her sacred physique.</p><p>The diagram had dimmed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could clearly feel the ‘self obscurity’ of life.</p><p>Little Yu’s life Diagram turned from bright to dim for only a moment. The surging Life force inside returned to the level of an ordinary person.</p><p>If he had gained anything.</p><p>At this moment, the Field of Profound Dao was filled with Profound Dao Seeds, and countless resplendent life forms bloomed.</p><p>“Life Dao Disc (49%).”</p><p>“Life Dao Disk (50%).”</p><p>Once he reached the 50 point mark, Xu Xiaoshou felt that the world had changed.</p><p>The ‘profundity’ from this enlightenment caused his soul to tremble and his spirit to groan.</p><p>It felt so good!</p><p>The thrill of the breakthrough was like flowing water!</p><p>As he swept his eyes across, Xu Xiaoshou saw not only the material world but also the spiritual world.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit who had formed a contract with him and had greedily devoured its own Life force, had a much weaker life Diagram than Elder Yu.</p><p>But if Elder Yu was the deep sea, then Greedy the Cat Spirit was a bottomless pit!</p><p>Its upper limit was so high that Xu Xiaoshou did not even know how to fill it up!</p><p>“This fellow…”</p><p>At this moment, the Life Dao Disc that was at 50% was only slightly inferior to Ye Xiaotian’s Spatial Upanishad array diagram. It was inferior to a few people but superior to billions of people.</p><p>He had transformed into an Ultimate Giant, and his blood circulation and lifeforce was much faster and higher than that of the humanoid Elder Yu.</p><p>But even so, Greedy the Cat Spirit still sucked in happily and could not seem to get enough!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized that the key to his Enlightenment was not to comprehend life and the nature of the world, but to contract with Greedy the Cat Spirit.</p><p>He maintained his state of epiphany but he drew out more of his mind and focused on the addition of points.</p><p>“Profound Dao Seed, smash!”</p><p>“Life Dao Disc (55%).”</p><p>“Life Dao Disc (60%).”</p><p>“Life Dao Disk (65%).”</p><p>“Life Dao Disk (70%).”</p><p>The faster he progressed, the more comfortable he felt when he interpreted the world from a vital perspective.</p><p>When he broke through the 70th mark, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had become extremely carefree.</p><p>He was about to enter the Great Path of Life and live as long as the heavens.</p><p>With just a thought, it was like the Cutting Path Stage, able to enter the Path Principles of Heaven and Earth.</p><p>In this state, in this world, not only could human-shaped creatures be understood as life, but mountain rocks, great arrays, spiritual weapons… Inanimate objects could also be understood as living things.</p><p>“Everything in existence is life!”</p><p>“The act of thinking is the representation of the dynamic state of life; the stillness of a mountain is the representation of the stillness of life!”</p><p>“The former explored the vastness of the spatial world, while the latter followed the rise and fall of the long river of time…”</p><p>“Vegetation is abundant, sea rocks have their lives, Heaven and earth are created, and all things have their names…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou became more energetic.</p><p>The life form became more static.</p><p>In the vortex of ghostly energy, the path energy around the Nine-Tailed Giant were condensed to the extreme. Decadent Taoist music suddenly sounded from all directions of Jade Capital City.</p><p>It was not someone who chanted this.</p><p>The Life Dao Disc that broke through to the corporeal state was like the Ancestral Tree, Bodhi Ancient Wood that bore fruit. Anyone who got close to it would gain something.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what are you doing?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was stunned.</p><p>He had personally witnessed how the Nine-Tailed Giant’s Life Great Path Diagram went from dim to dazzling.</p><p>At this moment, it was almost comparable to his Spatial Upanishad array diagram!</p><p>Was this still Xu Xiaoshou of the Tiangsang Spirit Palace?</p><p>Was this still the guy who cultivated the White Cloud Sword Technique Acquired stage spiritual technique and needed three years to cultivate one move?</p><p>He must have been possessed!</p><p>How could there be such a huge improvement after he had a contract with a ghost beast?</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi was not the only one who was tempted. Ye Xiaotian suddenly wanted to try and have a contract with a Ghost Beast as well.</p><p>He was really jealous!</p><p>He had comprehended the Great Path space for decades before he reached his current level. It could already be said that he had advanced rapidly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>It would not be an exaggeration to say that it was done overnight, right?</p><p>“In the past, I didn’t really understand how the Ten High Nobles, Kui Leihan, could comprehend the Penetrating Divine Senses in just a short period of time after he sat down.”</p><p>“Now, I seem to have gained something.”</p><p>Fang Wenxin was shocked as he looked at the Great Path of Life under the feet of the Nine-Tailed Giant.</p><p>No!</p><p>At this moment, it wasn’t an exaggeration to say that it was a Life Power Upanishad Formation!</p><p>“There really is such a gap between people.”</p><p>As a demi-saint, this was the first time Fang Wenxin had been so shocked.</p><p>Not only were the Saints in the city surprised, but the Spiritual Cultivators in Jade Capital City looked at the scene as if it had been a miracle.</p><p>They realized that they had witnessed history.</p><p>If one were to talk about the most talented people in the continent, there was Bazhun’an with his Three breaths for innate stage, three years for Sword Diety, Kui Leihan who received instant Enlightenment and The Divine, who was known for his Godhood called a god at the gates of hell…</p><p>No matter how strong they were, they couldn’t compare to Xu Xiaoshou’s current Upanishad!</p><p>The Ancient Sword Technique, Penetrating Divine Senses, and ancient martial arts were too off limits for most people.</p><p>However, even the lowest level of Spiritual Cultivators in Jade Capital City knew how difficult it was to comprehend the Upanishad. Even those who were not Spiritual Cultivators had heard of it.</p><p>And now…</p><p>Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, it wasn’t even a rumor or legend. They had seen it with their own eyes…</p><p>“That’s an Upanishad!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is crazy! Is his talent at such a high level?”</p><p>“What exactly are ghost beasts? I want an answer! Since Lord Shou can do this, I think the red-clothed people are in the wrong. We should accept the ghost beasts!”</p><p>“Life Upanishad, Life Upanishad… Heavens! I haven’t seen many life attributes before, but now there’s a Life Upanishad!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
