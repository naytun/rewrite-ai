Staring so hard that his eyes moved from the storyteller’s eyes to the corner of his mouth.</p><p>One breath, two breaths, three breaths…</p><p>Suddenly, he hooked the corner of his lips, then fiercely pressed it down.</p><p>This broken expression easily displaced the stone holding back the floodwaters, and the storyteller could no longer contain his laughter.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>But after laughing out loud, he quickly regained his composure with a face void of expression.</p><p>Without looking sideways or glancing at Bazhun’an or Gou Wuyue.</p><p>Respect must be given after all, for that is a brother…</p><p>“Hahahaha!”</p><p>In contrast, Hallmaster Dao seemed to lack any subtlety.</p><p>He laughed freely, even excitedly slapping his thigh, pointing at the storyteller as if finding kindred spirit, “You understand what I’m saying!”</p><p>“Shut up, will you?” Gou Wuyue couldn’t bear it any longer as the Demon Sword grew restless.</p><p>“Wahaha…” Hallmaster Dao’s laughter followed his pointing finger, almost plastered to his face, saying nothing, the smile growing increasingly twisted.</p><p>Gou Wuyue took a deep breath, “Boring.”</p><p>Hallmaster Dao’s smiling face instantly stiffened, and then he dramatically changed, his voice sharpening a bit, “Boring? He’s calling me boring?!”</p><p>He pointed at the storyteller, “He’s in his fifties or sixties, and all he has left to say is ‘boring’. Speechless, hahahaha… ”</p><p>The storyteller could no longer laugh.</p><p>Why go to such lengths, to peel away at someone’s scars, layer by layer?</p><p>Watching the man in front of him clutching his belly in laughter, bent over, laughing without any former image of a Hallmaster, suddenly felt terrifying.</p><p>The brother was right…</p><p>This man had been pressured by the title “Hallmaster Dao” for thirty or forty years, had upheld it for as long, and finally hit rock bottom and rebounded.</p><p>His teenage rebellion had come on powerfully at the age of midlife crisis.</p><p>He had removed the mask of the “Hallmaster Dao” to be himself again, and what he did was a self that even his laughter made others afraid!</p><p>The Divine Oracle had a liberated state.</p><p>Had Hallmaster Dao gone directly into a liberated, abnormal form?</p><p>“Isn’t it funny?”</p><p>Realizing no one else was laughing with him, Hallmaster Dao wiped away the tears and, without any hint of embarrassment, sat back in front of the Dao Imparting Mirror.</p><p>Without any hesitation, he shifted the topic with remarkable smoothness, pointing to the mirror, and said to Gou Wuyue:</p><p>“The ruler of the white-clothed people hasn’t lost yet, right?”</p><p>Gou Wuyue didn’t even shift his gaze.</p><p>Clearly, he was too lazy to deal with this character who had lost control and now had no cares and no one to restrain him.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao then looked at Bazhun’an and calmly said:</p><p>“If one word could ruin an ancient swordsman, Old Gou would have died long ago in the Eighth Palace, and Beibei would have had no chance of becoming an ancient swordsman… Right, oh great Eighth Sword Deity?”</p><p>Bazhun’an’s right eyelid twitched violently, and finally, taking a cold breath, he turned his head away, “Can’t you be quiet for a while?”</p><p>Hallmaster Dao then silently returned his gaze to the mirror.</p><p>Just as those around him thought he might finally be quiet.</p><p>The man exploded out of his seat in front of the entirely packed, noisy Dao Imparting Mirror and shouted:</p><p>“What a Fantasy Sword Technique!”</p><p>“What a Seven Sword Deity!”</p><p>The murmuring crowd halted, and their eyes turned as one.</p><p>But there, the actor playing Hallmaster Dao, after drawing attention from everyone in the room, spread his arms wide and sang with all his heart and soul:</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
