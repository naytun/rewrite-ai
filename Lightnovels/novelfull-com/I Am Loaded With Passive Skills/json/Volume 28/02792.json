if this final strike truly comes down…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, absolutely can’t resist it!</p><p>He will die!</p><p>In her heart, Sword Deity Bei treasured talent; she absolutely didn’t want to see such a dazzling ancient swordsman die like this.</p><p>But from the ancient traditions of swordsmen’s duels to the present…</p><p>A free-for-all battle is the greatest respect for an opponent, regardless of life or death of either side!</p><p>Moreover, apart from being an ancient swordsman, Xu Xiaoshou had other means to survive; he was even better at turning dire situations around…</p><p>“Submit or die!”</p><p>Sword Deity Bei bellowed, giving him a second chance, but there wouldn’t be a third.</p><p>“It’s just Absolute Imperial Control…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou below the Heavenly Giant Sword smiled, spun the Fourth Sword in his palm, and pointed upward.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The air exploded with demonic aura.</p><p>With the sword pointed at the sky, it formed a shockwave downward, turning Xu Xiaoshou’s body black while also breaking through the floor of the Emperor’s Palace.</p><p>The demonic aura fragmented and morphed into countless black small swords, which then assembled into a massive vicious sword of the same size as the Supreme Emperor Sword, heading upward!</p><p>“Clang—”</p><p>Thousands of swords that worshipped him!</p><p>This time, they were not worshipping the Supreme Emperor Sword or Sword Deity Bei.</p><p>But it was the uprising of the vicious sword, Fourth Sword, and the sword deity Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>The screen of the Dao Imparting Mirror timely zoomed in rapidly, again and again.</p><p>People looked like mere bullets, and at this moment in Xiao Ye’s hand, Jade Capital City wasn’t even as big as a brick of the Emperor’s Palace.</p><p>But what fell into the eyes of the people from the five regions at this moment was not these trivial matters but the dividing line at the Emperor’s Palace, with the gold Heavenly Emperor Sword piercing the clouds, upholding the figure of the Empress above the clouds.</p><p>Below, with the demonic aura forming ten thousand swords, creating Absolute Imperial Control, was the vicious Heavenly Giant Sword plunging into the Netherworld, the only difference being that Xu Xiaoshou, holding the sword, was the tip, the edge, the peak of this vicious sword.</p><p>This scene was too shocking!</p><p>The entire world within the Dao Imparting Mirror was filled with these two great swords confronting each other, gold and black intermingling!</p><p>Feng Zhongzui’s eyes seemed about to pop out as he covered his head, muttering quietly, “Who can survive this… Who can? Who might?”</p><p>Even having acquired the Fourth Sword.</p><p>Even if sword cognition could release such a vast amount.</p><p>Lord Shou was ultimately limited, unable to rely on external forces beyond ancient swordsmanship, so with what would he counter the final strike of Emperor Sword Heavenly Unravel?</p><p>The unstable second realm?</p><p>Or maybe, having accompanied him for less than a year, the Fourth Sword could achieve Perfect Heavenly Unravel, or perhaps unstable Heavenly Unravel?</p><p>Time seemed to pause.</p><p>The Empress above the Emperor Sword gave no further advice, her aura fully unleashed, and she stomped down fiercely.</p><p>In that instant, the world was enveloped in brilliant gold.</p><p>The Emperor’s Palace suddenly indented, the ten thousand Path Principles shattered, and the Heavenly Emperor Sword, as if its sky-suspending chain was cut, thunderously crashed down.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
