It spread to her entire face bit by bit, and then the corners of her lips parted.</p><p>She was about to mock him…</p><p>Suddenly, she saw that Xu Xiaoshou’s body had split open. There was no blood on his head that had been hit by the 26 starlight long knives?</p><p>“That’s not right!”</p><p>In the Jade Capital City, someone reached out to hold the plum blossoms that descended from the sky. Suddenly, her pupils trembled.</p><p>This Hong plum definitely did not come from Master Siren’s sword energy river. Its sharpness should belong to another ancient swordsman.</p><p>In the Arena, there were only two ancient swordsmen, and the other could only be…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“Ka-”</p><p>The image constructed by the Fantasy Sword Technique suddenly shattered.</p><p>Another explosion sounded from the collapsed black sky.</p><p>Everyone looked up and saw that the 26 Starlight Long Knives had revealed themselves. They bounced off Xu Xiaoshou’s head and exploded into divine energy with a bang. Then, they were hit by a red Taotie Beast Head. It was a Feast!</p><p>The twenty-six Xuanji Star Officials were also shaken by the backlash and revealed themselves. Their starry gauze clothes exploded in the wind, and their snow-white skin was festered from the backlash. It could be said that…They were completely mutilated!</p><p>“Just a joke.”</p><p>In the storm, Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows at the old woman and asked himself,</p><p>“You believed it?”</p><p>“Then you’re really stupid!”</p><p>The power of the Xuanji Star Official could not break through his Acalanātha’s defense, but the Power of Divinity had pushed him to the limit.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou withdrew some of his strength at the critical moment, and Acalanātha was broken.</p><p>After taking on the attack that had absorbed 99% of his power, he remained unmoving like a mountain.</p><p>The female Divine Puppets were also severely injured in an instant.</p><p>What they received was not ordinary damage, but the most violent and undiluted power. It was as if they had been struck in the head by twenty-six Starlight Long Knife.</p><p>Therefore, after a short pause…</p><p>“Boom! Boom!”</p><p>The twenty-six beautiful Veil-robed Stars were torn into fifty-two dismal pieces of the Divine Puppets, which then exploded into fine powder in the sky.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou received the power of the Flame Python’s sword in his hand, inheriting the direction of the Acalanātha, and adding the Power of Divinity that the Starlight Long Knife had devoured…</p><p>Under everyone’s shocked gazes, it ruthlessly chopped onto Dao Xuanji’s slender neck that could be chopped and burnt by lightning.</p><p>The scene was shocking!</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>White flames burst out from Dao Xuanji’s tilted head in the air, spreading out a pair of dazzling single-sided fire wings.</p><p>“Supreme Master!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen jumped up in shock.</p><p>The 26 Xuanji Star Officials could not break through Xu Xiaoshou’s defense and were blown up by his brain?</p><p>What kind of terrifying defense was this?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, stay…”</p><p>How could he hold back?</p><p>The Supreme master did not slack off at all and also killed him.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou’s brain was not hard, he would have been the one to be chopped into pieces by the twenty-six God-like Star Blades.</p><p>In the Struggle for the Great Path, how could one ask one person to hold back for another? And what kind of identity did one have to plead for mercy?</p><p>…Friends?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s sudden exclamation was drowned out by the heated discussion in the Jade Capital City,</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>“Hallmaster Xuanji has been killed!”</p><p>“It’s bleeding! F*ck, this is crazy, this is crazy. Lord Shou is too violent. Is his head made of iron? No, even iron isn’t that hard!”</p><p>“Oh my god, what did I just see…”</p><p>The third famed sword, the sharpness of the Flame Sword Flame Python, was fully displayed at this moment.</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s body had clearly been strengthened in various ways and was unbreakable.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou even had to use the Ultimate Giant to kick and pull him forcefully. Only then could he break an arm.</p><p>However, under the Flame Python Sword, although there was a great sense of sluggishness in the process of chopping down.</p><p>Along the way, the flames carried purple lightning. From the right side of his neck to the back of his left rib kidney, he had hacked and destroyed countless layers of spiritual arrays…</p><p>On Dao Xuanji’s body, countless pieces of gold, pearls, and precious jade exploded. Even her belt exploded into pieces, and her spiritual quality was completely gone.</p><p>“Psst!”</p><p>When the final tearing sound rang out.</p><p>Jade golden Holy Blood splattered all over the sky. It could no longer be counted in drops. It should be described as pouring.</p><p>Flame Python passed through Dao Xuanji’s waist!</p><p>Slash!</p><p>Her body was split in half!</p><p>The Holy Blood echoed the remains of the body that was thrown away, and there was also Dao Xuanji’s shocked expression of disbelief…The scene was fixed in the sky above the Jade Capital City.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou put away his sword and puffed out his chest. He stood still like a pine tree, neither sad nor happy.</p><p>The jade-gold Holy Blood on his face and nose burned away in the dazzling light.</p><p>The storm created by the explosion of the Xuanji Star Official even lifted the hem of his black robe, spreading the killing intent in the air.</p><p>Real, brutal, and bloody!</p><p>The world was completely silent.</p><p>No one had expected such an outcome.</p><p>Perhaps they had thought Xu Xiaoshou would win, that the possibility was one in a million…</p><p>However, when the outcome was so one-sided that it was so fast that it was impossible to think, everything felt like a dream, as if everyone was still immersed in the presentation of the Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>“You will eventually pay the price for arrogance and contempt.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sneered and turned his head coldly. He saw the Three Saints come to his senses from the Mei Siren’s sword attack, but he was stunned. He saw the Spiritual Cultivator masters in Jade Capital City who were clutching their heads in shock. He also saw Yu Zhiwen, who was standing on the city wall, looking as if she wanted to say something, but she stopped herself.</p><p>He sighed.</p><p>Green Plateau, a love affair.</p><p>Elder Dao the Flamboyant seemed to be really unpredictable. He had calculated everything to his bones and planted the seed of his heart being restless.</p><p>He paused for a moment and seemed to have thought of something.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou reached out and grabbed the illusion of Time Ancestor Shadow Staff.</p><p>“Freeze!”</p><p>Before the three demi-saint of the Holy Divine Palace could finish their words, time stopped.</p><p>With a whoosh…</p><p>After Xu Xiaoshou had killed her, she actually multiplied in public and revealed a second true body!</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“Hall Master Xuanji?”</p><p>“Little Xu Xiaoshou, stop!”</p><p>Demi-Saints Fang, Zhong, and Yu were stunned by Mei Siren’s sword. When they came back to their senses, Hallmaster Xuanji had been killed.</p><p>At that moment, the three Saints were so frightened that their faces turned pale as they rushed over.</p><p>At this moment, he looked at the sky full of jade-gold saint blood and looked at Dao Xuanji, who had been broken into two but still had signs of life…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that the old witch was not completely dead yet.</p><p>Even if this was only her demi-saint incarnation, even if she had the ability to resurrect, she should know…</p><p>When an ordinary person was enraged, blood would splatter everywhere!</p><p>If she dared to touch the people of the First Pavilion in the Sky, stab them in the back, and leave the city recklessly, she must be mentally prepared to bear the consequences!</p><p>She should know better…</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou who had returned was no longer a weakling of the Tiansang Spirit Palace, a coward of the Dongtianwang City, or even a hesitant person on the Abyss Island who was still tied up and did not want to make a move.</p><p>One wrong step could lead to more mistakes.</p><p>Taking advantage of her illness to take her life!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou would not let Dao Xuanji off, no matter who begged for mercy or not.</p><p>But before that…</p><p>On the wall of the Southern Zone, Yu Zhiwen’s eyes were shaking violently. Her body was trembling uncontrollably, but she refused to close her eyes.</p><p>At this moment, a pair of large hands covered her eyes. Darkness came and her spiritual senses were sealed.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s heart stopped beating and all the pores on her body opened. Her star compass flipped over and she was so scared that she wanted to attack.</p><p>Someone sneaked an attack on me in the chaos?</p><p>Who was it?</p><p>However, a familiar scent and a deep voice came from behind him in time…</p><p>“Children can’t watch whatever happens next.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
