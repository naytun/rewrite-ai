Looking back now, it carried a different charm.</p><p>“Brother! I’ve finally waited for you, why did you take so long?”</p><p>“Little brother?”</p><p>“Brother, it’s me. Do you remember me?”</p><p>“I don’t remember.”</p><p>“How could you forget me? After all, we were…”</p><p>“We were what?”</p><p>“You really forgot me? You can’t even remember my name?”</p><p>“Your name is…”</p><p>“Hmm, what’s my name?”</p><p>“I remember now… Is it you! Xu Xiaoji?”</p><p>I am not Xu Xiaoji. How could someone bear such an unpleasant name and not change it?</p><p>I am the Fourth Sword, the vicious sword, Fourth Sword!</p><p>Only the name of the Five Great Divine Instruments of Chaos is worthy of me!</p><p>When the Supreme Emperor Sword unleashed End’s Fury, the will of Xu Xiaoji, combined with the spirit of the Fourth Sword, could easily sense the sword-bearer whose Heavenly Unravel State was more than halfway through, and suddenly felt a strong resistance.</p><p>“Lord Shou, you truly are a soft-hearted person…”</p><p>The sword spirit’s origin did not intervene too much but, like countless choices since the dawn of chaos, chose to let go and allow the sub-spirit to make its own choice.</p><p>Of course, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t want to give up his old acquaintances so easily.</p><p>But to Xu Xiaoji, what is the best destiny for a life without purpose, for hurried steps not knowing the meaning of the path ahead, and for reluctantly accompanying them to the end of life?</p><p>No!</p><p>No one can stop even a name like “Xu Xiaoji” from having the right to shine brilliantly!</p><p>For from the moment of its creation, it was destined for this moment of brilliance and glory!</p><p>Heavenly Unravel is not led by the will of the sword-bearer, but by the will of the sword itself, the spirit of the sword…</p><p>Xu Xiaoji didn’t resist Lord Shou’s rejection, but merely shared a sliver of his desire for freedom—in the state of Heavenly Unravel, not only can the sword sense the emotions of the sword-bearer, but the sword-bearer can also feel the sword’s:</p><p>“Lord Shou, I yearn to blaze brilliantly!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts paused, and in that moment, he understood why the “names” of ancient swordsmen and the Seven Sword Deities existed.</p><p>It was the entire Su family, who could die contentedly after hearing the Dao in the morning;</p><p>It was the vicious sword spirit, eager to shine brightly and return to its origin.</p><p>Whether it is the sword-bearer or the sword-bearer’s sword.</p><p>What they have been pursuing and passing down from the very beginning is the pride of the ancient swordsman, the belief that “one may die, but one’s name must never be lost.”</p><p>What I pursue…</p><p>What Xu Xiaoji pursues…</p><p>Aren’t they different?</p><p>As the End’s Fury spread throughout his body and bent the Fourth Sword in that instant, Xu Xiaoshou let go of his resistance.</p><p>He then saw Xu Xiaoji taking over the will of the Fourth Sword’s spirit origin, and also taking control of his own body, laughing unrestrainedly, proudly proclaiming his glorious moment!</p><p>And so, the world before the Dao Imparting Mirror witnessed the supreme Emperor Sword’s End’s Fury piercing Lord Shou and shattering the Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation, blooming bloodlessly.</p><p>There was only endless demonic aura, cascading in the layers surrounding the plunging Heavenly Emperor Sword.</p><p>They were then accompanied by mournful melodies, insanity spreading across heaven and earth:</p><p>“Paths twist and turn, rolling through the wild.”</p><p>“Spirits become demons, original thoughts rewritten.”</p><p>“Divergent roads share the same root, life should not be lived carelessly.”</p><p>“Good establishes Tiansang, evil culminates in Heavenly Unravel.”</p><p>“Fourth Sword·Sacrifice!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
