Eventually, he noticed that the Greedy the Cat Spirit had gained weight and teasingly called it “Little Fat Cat” for sneaking too many treats.</p><p>The nightmare reached its climax!</p><p>It turned out that the Greedy the Cat Spirit was considered a top-tier ghost beast by humans.</p><p>Some were even powerful enough to cross the boundary of worlds, reaching into the Yuan Mansion world that had evolved into the Apricot Realm just to capture it.</p><p>Without a doubt, the owner protected it once again.</p><p>But this time, after issuing a flurry of orders, he fell into an unprecedentedly deep coma.</p><p>The Greedy the Cat Spirit desperately engaged in conducting alchemy!</p><p>Using its most advanced conducting alchemy techniques, it refined the Life force that leaked from its owner’s body into large Elixirs… and ate them!</p><p>The owner didn’t need many Elixirs.</p><p>He only needed to remain unconscious for a while, and then he would wake up. The Greedy the Cat Spirit was certain of this.</p><p>However, it needed this great opportunity to fill its stomach and allow its strength to complete a breakthrough to walk in front of the owner.</p><p>It no longer liked being coddled by its owner, who treated it like something fragile, afraid it would break or dissolve in his care.</p><p>It wanted to deal with the Holy Emperor Qilin and the Holy Emperor Bei Huai…</p><p>Nightmare!</p><p>This truly was a nightmare!</p><p>The Apricot Realm had been breached once again. The owner was now forced to use the Greedy the Cat Spirit as bait to escape the Apricot Realm.</p><p>This was something that would have been unthinkable before.</p><p>The Greedy the Cat Spirit knew what kind of person its owner was. He could never abandon it.</p><p>Desperation!</p><p>He had fallen into a dire, life-threatening situation!</p><p>The Greedy the Cat Spirit felt that its combat strength had grown significantly, yet it still wasn’t included in the owner’s calculations because the bond between them only allowed for a vague sense of each other, not direct communication.</p><p>Even if it could say something, the owner probably wouldn’t believe it…</p><p>So, as usual, the Greedy the Cat Spirit acted dazed and adorably agreed. Perhaps that was how a pet or mascot should behave.</p><p>The Greedy the Cat Spirit knew that by staying in the Apricot Realm, it would face the most terrifying enemies its owner had ever encountered.</p><p>The Greedy the Cat Spirit was not afraid.</p><p>It wanted to see for itself the dangers that its owner faced during his hunts, to see what they looked like…</p><p>He arrived!</p><p>The figure appeared to be a normal human, although there was no doubt he was evil.</p><p>However, unlike the owner and the guests of the Apricot Realm, he was the only human who had acknowledged the existence of a Saint Beast like it.</p><p>“Little guy, have you eaten dragon meat before?”</p><p>When that person brought out the blood food…</p><p>The Greedy the Cat Spirit knew that its trial was approaching.</p><p>From Palace Master Bai Zhou of Xu Yue Grey Palace to owner Xu Xiaoshou, they were all strictly forbidden it from consuming blood food.</p><p>So, even though it could have tasted the two eyeballs, which they called the Lei Family’s Eyes, the Greedy the Cat Spirit resisted the powerful primal urge and instead used its Engulfing Power to digest them.</p><p>Even with the entire dragon corpse, where the owner’s defenses were ineffective. The Greedy the Cat Spirit could easily break through the space blockade, yet it had been salivating for countless months without taking a bite.</p><p>No one could force it!</p><p>The Greedy the Cat Spirit was unwilling to do anything that might displease the owner!</p><p>But from the beginning to the end of the dream, the Greedy the Cat Spirit had never encountered someone who respected it like this.</p><p>It could easily perceive the temptation in the words of this human named Dao Qiongcang. However, it could not deny that…</p><p>He had indeed explained the concepts of swallowing and eating, defined satiety and hunger, and provided answers and choices that differentiated between life and death and companionship’</p><p>The Greedy the Cat Spirit didn’t want to eat even a single bite of blood food.</p><p>Even if this human named Dao Qiongcang forced it into its mouth, the Greedy the Cat Spirit would choose to use its Engulfing Power to digest it.</p><p>However, after his attempts to lure it failed, he seriously said, “If you eat this, there is a fifty percent chance that you will die quickly. You will be liberated, you will be destroyed, you will go mad. Perhaps you will die at the hands of red-clothed people, the Sacred Mountain’s great array, or ultimately, at my hands.”</p><p>“However, there is also a fifty percent chance that you will become one with him and never be separated. You will not remain as weak as you are now, nor will you be imprisoned in this world forever. You will walk by his side but face even more terrifying risks… Yes, that will no longer concern me. You will bear it together.”</p><p>“In my view, life has only one choice, but that is outcome theory.”</p><p>“In your eyes, there is still a choice.”</p><p>The dream came to an end.</p><p>The Greedy the Cat Spirit understood what was right and wrong, what was black and white.</p><p>It was no longer willing to be bound by this sense of confusion and restraint. It wanted to break out of this cocoon, this invisible cage that trapped it!</p><p>It made its choice—eat, not swallow!</p><p>The stimulation from the first taste of the forbidden fruit was far beyond its previous imagination. The Greedy the Cat Spirit watched itself go mad and even attack the owner.</p><p>It easily broke through the barrier of worlds.</p><p>It bit off the body of the demi-saint.</p><p>It sensed a vast amount of blood food around it, and couldn’t stop the overwhelming hunger. It wanted to come into the city for a full meal.</p><p>When it was restrained…</p><p>When it was repeatedly pushed back…</p><p>Perhaps its life was nearing its end, but the Greedy the Cat Spirit did not regret its choice. In its final moments of complete loss, it chose to eat its owner.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
