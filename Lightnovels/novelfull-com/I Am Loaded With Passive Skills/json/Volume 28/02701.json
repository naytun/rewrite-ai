Half of it was suffused with a demonic aura; the other half was a wall of infernal white flame.</p><p>No one could get a clear picture of what was going on.</p><p>“Fourth Sword?”</p><p>“There’s also an infernal white flame. That one seems to be his sword. There’s also that Golden Giant from earlier…”</p><p>“Lord Shou? Xu Xiaoshou of the Eastern Region?”</p><p>“How is that possible? Wasn’t the demi-saint taken down in the ghost beast saint calamity? Would he really have the guts to come?”</p><p>The crowd was shocked.</p><p>Too many people did not believe Xu Xiaoshou would dare to risk his life alone.</p><p>However, at this moment, countless spiritual swords were trembling in the sky above Jade Capital City.</p><p>Many apricot trees were growing below, and their branches and leaves released intense Sword Will.</p><p>It was a reaction to the arrival of an ancient swordsman.</p><p>In this present era, the only one who had such an astonishing Sword Will and dared to make enemies of the Holy Divine Palace was the so-called Saint Servant, Lord Shou.</p><p>“Clang! Clang!”</p><p>At this moment, the sound of a sword humming could be heard outside the city.</p><p>The Fourth Sword and Flying Flame Python were nailed to the Xuanji great array. The black-and-white radiance dimmed, having tested the strength of the formation.</p><p>The two swords left black marks in the sky and a trail of vile ghostly energy as they flew.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Greedy, the Cat Spirit poked its huge head out of the raging ghostly energy. Atop his head stood a person.</p><p>In his right hand, that person held a sword, and in his left, he controlled another, a sword of fire. Fourth Sword, Vicious Sword, and Flame Python hung at his waist. The figure was in high spirits.</p><p>Something unexpected happened!</p><p>A voice resounded from outside the city limits, penetrating the Xuanji great array in an extremely domineering fashion, echoing loud and clear.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou of the First Pavilion in the Sky is here to visit Jade Capital City!”</p><p>“A distinguished guest has arrived. Old granny, it’s fine if you don’t welcome me, but shouldn’t you at least say so in my face? Why aren’t you granting me passage through the great array? Could it be? Are you afraid of me?!”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>When they saw the true appearance of the black-robed youth in the sky, Jade Capital City erupted in disbelief.</p><p>“It’s Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“Isn’t he the Saint Servant? What is this First Pavilion in the Sky?”</p><p>“No, that’s not the issue! The real question is, how is it that he is still alive? Shouldn’t he be dead? I heard Holy Emperor Qilin tore him apart…”</p><p>“Rubbish! He was the one who tore Qilin apart!”</p><p>“He’s a jinx. He causes trouble wherever he goes. I was wondering how a disaster could suddenly befall Jade Capital City… Now, we know the answer!”</p><p>“Did you hear that? He even called Hallmaster Xuanji… Old granny?”</p><p>“Hiss, terrifying.”</p><p>Jade Capital City spiraled into chaos.</p><p>While some people in the central region did not know the name of Dao Xuanji, the same couldn’t be said of ‘Lord Shou.’</p><p>He who wielded the sword that slashed Rao Yaoyao, the one who wreaked havoc in the Four Symbols Secret Realm, and who tore apart Holy Emperor Qilin…</p><p>Even if one did not consider the mess Xu Xiaoshou had caused in the distant Eastern Region, there were still plenty of things worth mentioning, particularly his time in the Central Region and his escapades with the Spiritual Cultivators there.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a peerless, fierce existence!</p><p>And now, this fiend had descended upon Jade Capital City?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Dao Xuanji stood in the air above the city, glaring at the uninvited guest who had come knocking at her door, killing intent kindling in her eyes.</p><p>She had used all sorts of methods to increase her power, not wishing to benefit from the influence Qiongcang’s name could bring, to the extent that she had even left Jade Capital City for a time. Now, she had raised the banners, marching south with her army, conquering those who stood in her way, starting with Xu Yue Grey Palace and, thereafter, the five regions.</p><p>Yet, at this crucial juncture, her momentum had vanished, stopped by one person!</p><p>Not only was he unrestrained in his actions, but he also humiliated her twice in quick succession.</p><p>More aggravating, however, was the glory he had snatched from her open arms!</p><p>It was supposed to be her time to shine, to show the world the power Jade Capital City wielded, and her timely intervention through the Xuanji great array. Everything was planned to the last detail, all to boost her reputation. She, Hallmaster Dao Xuanji! Her plans were not meant to be some wedding gift for some piddling upstart, least of all Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>Moreover…</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s brows knitted in thought, ripples forming waves in her heart.</p><p>The great array had not been breached and, under her control, displayed no flaws.</p><p>Yet, how did Xu Xiaoshou’s voice reverberate through the city?</p><p>His attainments in the heavenly Dao were unquestionable, but how and where had he learned these techniques?</p><p>Dao Xuanji flicked her horsetail whisk and withdrew her gaze from the Ancestral Dragon Apricot Tree pattern, still lost in thought.</p><p>Perhaps it had nothing to do with Xu Xiaoshou’s abilities…</p><p>Dao Xuanji took this opportunity to properly assess the black-robed young man she had heard of and finally had the chance to meet.</p><p>No matter what, a battle was inevitable since things had come to this.</p><p>His blood would serve as an offering to the Holy Divine Palace in the Southern region!</p><p>“You are Xu…”</p><p>“Stop! Are you deaf? Can’t you hear me?”</p><p>Just as Dao Xuanji opened her mouth, Xu Xiaoshou crushed the Three Days Frozen Calamity and stepped on Greedy the Cat Spirit’s head. He waved his hand brazenly as if he had not intentionally interrupted her.</p><p>“Everyone in the five regions knows who I am.”</p><p>“Only the deaf, blind, and mute… Oh, and perhaps you, an illiterate old hag who is practically deaf.”</p><p>“If you still can’t confirm my identity, just listen to those calling my name at your feet!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou spun around and activated the Art of Spiritual Array Disc while perched on Greedy the Cat Spirit’s head.</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi’s eyes lit up as he carefully examined it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou instantly entered a state of heightened comprehension, achieving the Unity of Man and the Heavens as he sought enlightenment.</p><p>He flung his hands, and countless spiritual threads flew out, stabbing into the Xuanji great array with great precision… In the area above the array eye?</p><p>“This array…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered for a moment, but he was not surprised. Instead, he was happy.</p><p>This array was clearly derived from the capital’s great array, a new version of the old one.</p><p>With the skill of a seasoned weaver, it was child’s play to make changes to the array.</p><p>Everything fell into place.</p><p>If Dao Xuanji’s power could so easily eclipse the decades of research her older brother had put in, then his life would have lost all meaning.</p><p>Indeed, she would have been crowned one of the Ten High Nobles instead!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
