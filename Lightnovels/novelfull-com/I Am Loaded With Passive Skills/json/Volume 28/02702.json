He had been studying it since he entered the city.</p><p>Every time he gained something, he would sigh. Elder Dao the Flamboyant was disgusting…</p><p>“Rise!”</p><p>Despite being distracted, Xu Xiaoshou raised his hand and used his spirit thread to control the great array as if he had extracted a small part of the Xuanji great array.</p><p>Although it was still impossible to truly crack it, it was a piece of cake to destroy the small soundproof array attached to it.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>In an instant, the clamor in the Jade Capital City was heard as he raised his hand.</p><p>“Watched. Passive Points: +9999.”</p><p>“Debated. Passive Points: +9999.”</p><p>“Admired, Passive Points,+9999.”</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points,+9999.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Notifications popped up on the Information Bar.</p><p>It felt like a month of constipation had been cleared. Xu Xiaoshou’s expression was bright.</p><p>“Awesome!”</p><p>He retracted his hands and placed them behind his waist.</p><p>When he reached the peak of Jade Capital, he raised his head and climbed to the peak, looking like a giant in a fantasy realm, preparing to Swallow the Mountains and Rivers whole.</p><p>Fourth Sword and Flame Python danced, crisscrossing around his body, drawing a gorgeous sword flower. It was only a gaudy one, without any practical significance.</p><p>With the crazed Greedy the Cat Spirit under his feet, Xu Xiaoshou raised his chin and said:</p><p>“Tell this old woman who I am.”</p><p>The sound of his voice drifted in all directions of Jade Capital City.</p><p>Silence held the city in an iron grip. It was as if they were under the influence of an invisible and intangible force, the Black Hand, guiding the course of events in a particular direction.</p><p>Tens of millions of people shouted in unison:</p><p>“Grandpa Shou! Grandpa Shou! Grandpa Shou!”</p><p>After three cheers, everyone seemed to wake from a dream. They looked around in shock, not knowing what had just happened.</p><p>“Cheered. Passive Points: +9999.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally had his dream come true, and it felt like he was on top of the world.</p><p>He casually picked his ears, his lips curling into a mocking smile. “I’m sure you all know who I am, then?”</p><p>“Haha…”</p><p>The body can be restrained, but the mind can not.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian, under the restrictive spell’s chains, looked as pleased as if he had just swallowed honey when he heard that. He slapped his thigh and said:</p><p>“Good! Good! Haha!”</p><p>As expected of you…</p><p>Leaning on the wall facing the Southern Zone, Yu Zhiwen looked up at the shining figure in the sky.</p><p>The corners of her eyes curled up. She wanted to laugh.</p><p>However, she could not laugh because to do so would be the height of disrespect toward her Supreme Master.</p><p>Fang Wenxin, Yu Kunpeng, and Zhong Yuanzi hovered in the air outside the city. They stared blankly at the man standing atop the ghost beast, their expressions a sight to behold.</p><p>It was the kid who had toyed with everyone outside the city.</p><p>He must have swallowed the courage of a bear or leopard. How else could he have had the courage to mess around with the whole city?</p><p>Even now, he was toying with them right in front of Dao Xuanji!</p><p>However, this technique…</p><p>This Force…</p><p>What kind of spirit technique was this?</p><p>Dao Xuanji, the first to bear the brunt of the attack, had an extremely ugly expression. It was as if Jade Capital City was no longer her city but a city controlled by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>At this moment, a figure leaped over. It was Jiang Nayi.</p><p>Jiang Nayi did not know what kind of dog had the audacity to kick up such a big fuss. As she took her place by Dao Xuanji’s side, she whipped out a portrait and compared its likeness to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Palace Master Xuanji, It’s Xu Xiaoshou. Don’t you remember…?”</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Dao Xuanji paused, pulling back her outstretched palm, but it was too late.</p><p>Jiang Nayi felt her world tilt on its axis as two bloody teeth flew out of her mouth. Her whereabouts would remain a mystery after she received that blow.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was overjoyed.</p><p>He sat down, his sudden action causing Greedy the Cat Spirit a wave of nausea. He cupped his chin as he rested on one knee and sneered.</p><p>“That was a good hit!”</p><p>“When two armies face each other, taking down the military advisor first is important. It seems you know how wars are won!”</p><p>Dao Xuanji felt her eyes twitch, her pupils narrowing into pinpricks. Even the feathers of her horsetail whisk trembled as she sought to restrain her emotions.</p><p>“Glared At, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Oh, was she angry just like that?</p><p>It seemed like she hadn’t learned enough under Elder Dao the Flamboyant, that showy old codger! It was a surprise that she still lacked self-restraint!</p><p>“Your soul is boiling…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou commented with interest.</p><p>He smiled and leaned forward, shaking his finger. “That’s not good. A Divine Sorceress such as yourself should have better control over your emotions. Who knows? It might lead to mistakes…”</p><p>“Fang Wenxin!” Dao Xuanji could not take it anymore. She hollered, “What is the punishment for colluding with a ghost beast?”</p><p>It was an entertaining spectacle.</p><p>Was it wrong that, despite their opposing stances, Xu Xiaoshou’s every word struck a chord in Fang Wenxin’s heart?</p><p>If he were a hundred years younger, Fang Wenxin would have done the same…</p><p>Unfortunately, he was old.</p><p>When Dao Xuanji’s words were thrown at him, Fang Wenxin knew he could not sit back and do nothing, so he responded.</p><p>“It’s the death penalty.”</p><p>Dao Xuanji waved her horsetail whisk.</p><p>“Then kill him!”</p><p>“Wait!” Xu Xiaoshou reached out his hand in time and said regretfully, “Before you kill me, may I ask something of you? I hope I’m not inconveniencing this Old Lady with my paltry request.”</p><p>“Puchi.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen, on the wall facing the Southern Zone, burst into laughter. Fortunately, this laugh was mixed with the crowd below, so no one should have noticed.</p><p>She quickly covered her mouth.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s ability to give nicknames was exceptional!</p><p>Although her master did not look old, “old granny” was an appropriate description of her serious, old-fashioned master…</p><p>Ah, no, it was a sin…</p><p>‘Little Yu, oh Little Yu, what are you thinking? That’s your master you’re thinking about!’ Yu Zhiwen slapped her cheeks anxiously.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, riding atop Greedy the Cat Spirit, did not give Dao Xuanji any time to reply. He pointed at the people below suspiciously and asked…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
