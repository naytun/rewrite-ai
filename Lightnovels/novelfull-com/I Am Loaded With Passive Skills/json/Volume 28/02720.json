He used the Blood Shadow copper coins, one of the ten Great Psionic Weapons, to kill so many ghost beasts and capture their souls and caused them to be filled with resentment. However, he was frustrated and lived a miserable life on the Sacred Mountain.</p><p>However…</p><p>The word he used was not ‘kill’ but ‘redeem’!</p><p>Redemption for what?</p><p>Did the ghost beasts require redemption?</p><p>When Fang Wenxin imprisoned the soul of the ghost beast, it could be considered as a redemption.</p><p>Who were the people who had betrayed him, who were the relatives and friends who had abandoned him?</p><p>The red-clothed people?</p><p>Or the Holy Divine Palace?</p><p>Nonsense, this was completely impossible!</p><p>“Lord Shou, what are you talking about? Why don’t I understand?”</p><p>“Did they use some secret language? Or was it just Lord Shou’s itchy mouth that tried to rile the old senior from the red-clothed people?”</p><p>“I don’t think so. Look, he didn’t even stop old Senior Fang from capturing the soul of the ghost beast Greedy the Cat Spirit. He only said one sentence and was fearless…”</p><p>“Then according to your understanding, what else do we not know about the ghost beast?”</p><p>“Oh, redemption…”</p><p>There was a great commotion in the city.</p><p>Countless people mulled over this sentence, but they could not understand it.</p><p>After all, in the Shengshen Continent, the word ‘ghost beast’ was a forbidden word. Few people had actually seen one before.</p><p>Even Liu Changqing from the Eastern Region, who had cultivated to the Cutting Path Stage, had to take the risk to understand the ghost beast after he became the ghost beast host body.</p><p>Even the Cutting Path Stage was like this.</p><p>He knew nothing about the world below the Cutting Path Stage.</p><p>High up in the sky, Elder Yu’s eyes narrowed when he heard the voice. There was no expression on his face.</p><p>But his hands hung at his side.</p><p>He did not just set Zhong Yuanzi down. He also put down his weapon, the fishing rod.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi looked at Fang Wenxin.</p><p>For the first time, he saw a dull expression on the face of this old but vigorous senior of the red-clothed people. It was as if he had been struck by lightning.</p><p>Not only did the Blood Shadow copper coins’ Ten Thousand Ghost Soul Capture technique stop because of his words, but Fang Wenxin’s soul seemed to have drifted away and he appeared completely lost in his own thoughts.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi didn’t understand and turned to look at Elder Yu.</p><p>“Don’t say a word!”</p><p>Elder Yu turned his head and said in a serious tone. “Leave it to them. We shouldn’t interfere in the current situation.”</p><p>“What was that about?” Zhong Yuanzi was puzzled. It sounded like everyone was aware of some secret, but he was not?</p><p>“Don’t ask.”</p><p>“I’m curious…”</p><p>“If you know too much, you won’t even be able to do any research.”</p><p>“Then I’m not curious anymore.”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi drew back and erased all his presence in the sky. However, he suddenly sensed something and frowned as he glanced towards the south.</p><p>In the south of Jade Capital City, a figure that was as lifeless as a corpse slid silently out of the Deathly Path.</p><p>It was an orange figure who donned a faceless mask.</p><p>He held a blood-red pearl and injected Holy Power into it, but his hands suddenly slid down weakly.</p><p>However, he only froze for a short moment before he regained his senses.</p><p>His form flashed and returned to the Great Path.</p><p>“There’s a situation…”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi pointed to the south and was about to speak.</p><p>“Don’t say anything!”</p><p>Elder Yu nudged his butt in frustration and stared intently at Fang Wenxin.</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi wanted to say something but hesitated. In the end, he sighed and pretended that he didn’t see anything.</p><p>Surrounded by the nine copper coins that revolved around him, Fang Wenxin quickly came back to his senses. He shook his head and looked at Xu Xiaoshou expressionlessly.</p><p>“I don’t understand what you’re saying.”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit struggled on.</p><p>However, the Ten Thousand Ghost Soul Capture technique was not activated. Instead, it maintained its position.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed. “Do you not understand? Or do you not wish to understand? Or are you afraid of too many things? You clearly understood, but you pretended not to understand?”</p><p>Fang Wenxin looked away calmly.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The void shook, and the Ten Thousand Ghost Soul Capture technique continued to drain Greedy the Cat Spirit’s soul.</p><p>“Old Senior Fang!” Xu Xiaoshou still did not stop him. Instead, he raised his voice and said loudly.</p><p>“You’re too arrogant!”</p><p>“In this world, is there no one you can trust who is willing to share your hardships and walk side by side with you?”</p><p>Fang Wenxin was indifferent, but his hands moved more rapidly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the people in Jade Capital City and took a deep breath. He pointed at Greedy the Cat Spirit and said.</p><p>“This ghost beast Greedy the Cat Spirit, from Xu Yue Grey Palace followed me when I was still an insignificant fellow. It has never killed anyone before.”</p><p>“I’ve even restricted its food intake. It can’t eat meat and can only eat spirit herbs and elixirs. It led a very difficult life.”</p><p>“What I taught it was not the Dao of killing, but the art of conducting alchemy to save people!”</p><p>Fang Wenxin’s hands suddenly trembled.</p><p>The people in the city were surprised.</p><p>Ghost beast…</p><p>Conducting alchemy?</p><p>Could these be combined together?</p><p>It was hard to imagine what kind of super imagination Xu Xiaoshou had when he said that this Beast of Disaster had been conducting alchemy all this time?</p><p>Everyone felt that this scenario was very comical. How could it be real!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou ignored the crowd and didn’t look at Fang Wenxin anymore. He just muttered to himself.</p><p>“It did its conducting alchemy day and night. From a harmless little white cat, it became a third-grade conducting alchemy cat.”</p><p>“You didn’t hear the wrong thing. Right now, it’s equivalent to a Sovereign Stage Elixir Master.”</p><p>The city was in an uproar.</p><p>There were doubts, mockery, and all kinds of curses…</p><p>Elder Yu fell silent when he heard this.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
