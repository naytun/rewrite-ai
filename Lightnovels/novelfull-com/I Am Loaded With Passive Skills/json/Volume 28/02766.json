She spat out blood and her face was filled with shock and confusion.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>“This was impossible!”</p><p>How was it impossible?</p><p>The Six Paths of the Human Realm Dao. The moment Xu Xiaoshou comprehended the Life Upanishad, he realized why it was so powerful.</p><p>This was because it relied on the power of the law of life.</p><p>An ancient warrior was not boorish in the literal sense. On the contrary, the level of their Dao was higher and more obscure.</p><p>Therefore, ordinary people couldn’t tell.</p><p>The Human Realm Dao could borrow the vitality of all things in the world. It could temporarily absorb the power from the land within a radius of a few miles and transform sand into a tower. It could turn the virtual image of The Divine into reality.</p><p>Then…</p><p>After he had mastered the Life Upanishad and understood thoroughly the Law of Life, he made a slight change to it.</p><p>What if he did not borrow the lives of other living beings; instead he absorbed the vitality of only one person?</p><p>Of course this was impossible!</p><p>The Human Realm Dao was not the Body of Devour.</p><p>However, what if the life force in the person he absorbed was also something she had just borrowed and had yet to digest?</p><p>It would be a natural outcome!</p><p>Dao Xuanji lost to Xu Xiaoshou in terms of the comprehension of the essence of the Great Path. Therefore, even with the help of the God Worship Willow Tree, she inexplicably lost all her power.</p><p>And at this moment, Xu Xiaoshou from the Sovereign Dao Realm, who had suddenly obtained the life force of thousands of prisoners from the Dead Sea, was about to explode.</p><p>A portion of that power was swallowed by the Dragon Pearl, a portion underwent a transformation, and a portion was stolen by Greedy the Cat Spirit…</p><p>The rest were still full!</p><p>“A fool who talks about dreams also does foolish stuff; You overestimated your abilities!”</p><p>“Dao Xuanji, how dare you with your Demi-saint Physique compare yourself to me, Lord Shou?”</p><p>Two orbs of wind and snow exploded under Xu Xiaoshou’s feet. His body turned into a streak of black lightning and dashed into the sky. With this force, his Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand appeared and it was covered with scarlet golden dragon scales.</p><p>A palm strike through the heart!</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s entire body cracked, and a bloody shadow appeared in the distance.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seized the opportunity to seize the life force that was incompatible with the life pattern in his body.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>Like an octopus, Dao Xuanji’s heart, that was also the heart of the God Worship Willow Tree, that pranced about frantically among the willow branches, was pulled out by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou who was dressed in black, hovered in the air. His eyes were filled with disdain as he flung the heart of the God Worship Willow Tree away.</p><p>“This is for you, Dragon Apricot.”</p><p>Away in the Nine Heavens, Dragon Apricot who had transformed into a pattern of golden light happily lowered its branches and easily swept it into the Apricot Realm.</p><p>As for Dao Xuanji, who had been flung far away and stripped of the protection of the God Worship Willow Tree, with all her escape routes cut off…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou leaped up and looked away. He glanced at Lei Xi’er and Lei Shuangxing.</p><p>“The rest is up to you.”</p><p>Lei Shuangxing gripped his Divine-beating Crutch tightly. His Qi was not locked onto Dao Xuanji at all. Instead, it was firmly anchored on Xu Xiaoshou. He was moved by the attack just now.</p><p>The Human Realm Dao pierced through one’s heart.</p><p>The red-scorched hands gripped the God Worship Willow Tree.</p><p>He recalled that the last time they met, this person was worried about the Chief of the six divisions, Yi and also Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>Now when they met again, Hallmaster Xuanji was like an ant in his eyes!</p><p>Lei Shuangxing turned around and looked at Lei Xi’er. “You, or me?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er looked up. Her God Devil Eyes were calm as she muttered to herself.</p><p>“It’s just a body…”</p><p>“Up until now, I have not seen the Lei Family’s Eyes that were lost back then, nor have I seen the ones that she had retrieved from the various Demi-Saint families…”</p><p>Lei Shuangxing nodded slightly.</p><p>Of course, Dao Xuanji kept some things hidden.</p><p>With her status, how could she reveal the Lei Family’s eyes in public?</p><p>As for the possibility of ‘nothing’…</p><p>What a joke!</p><p>If it were not for the Lei Family’s Eyes, what was Dao Xuanji’s motive to destroy the Lei family back then?</p><p>If it wasn’t for the sake of supremacy, how could she endure Xu Xiaoshou’s punches and kicks?</p><p>“It’s just a body Then I’ll treat it as having received some interest money in advance.”</p><p>Lei Shuangxing pulled out his Divine-beating Crutch and pointed at the sky. His sword cognition turned into a condensed silver line that shot through Dao Xuanji’s body.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The sky exploded in a cascade of silver flowers.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
