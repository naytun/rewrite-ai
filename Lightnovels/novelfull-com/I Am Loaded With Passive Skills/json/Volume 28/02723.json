He went straight to the point. “Xu Xiaoshou is making a ruckus in the Jade Capital City. He wants Elder Fang to give him an answer. He was asking about whether the ghost beasts are good or bad.”</p><p>“What about the ghost beast?” Beibei thought she had heard wrong. Was there such an innocent side to Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>“Whether ghost beasts are good or bad!”</p><p>“Your ‘bad’ means ‘very bad’, or…”</p><p>“Good and bad!”</p><p>“Oh, oh.”</p><p>Beibei finally understood. She still felt that Xu Xiaoshou was naive, but she didn’t interrupt and looked at Hallmaster Xuanji.</p><p>“Let him ask. We lack time the most now.” Dao Xuanji looked beyond the sky.”</p><p>“The main point is that Elder Fang is an upright person. Since he couldn’t answer, the Jade Capital City fell into a commotion. Everyone is arguing about the term ‘ghost beast’…”</p><p>Xi opened his mouth, but he stopped.</p><p>He believed that Hallmaster Xuanji understood what he meant. If he mentioned too much, someone would point fingers at the red-clothed people.</p><p>“Do you believe the Saint Servant’s mouth or the world’s conventional thinking?” Dao Xuanji asked instead of answering.</p><p>Xi shook his head.</p><p>Of course, he knew what Hallmaster Xuanji meant.</p><p>It was nothing more than the dark forces throwing misinformation. Time would make people forget everything, and history would only be written by the victors.</p><p>However, there was another important point…</p><p>“It’s mainly because Yu Zhiwen stood up!”</p><p>“What did you say?” Dao Xuanji’s expression changed when she heard that. She finally looked over.</p><p>“She directly answered Xu Xiaoshou’s question and pointed out that the Red-clothed people had indeed gone astray, but the situation was not as bad as what Xu Xiaoshou thought…”</p><p>“Tell her to come back!” Dao Xuanji interrupted.</p><p>Xi choked.</p><p>As expected, the content after the “but” would always be habitually ignored by people because it was not too important compared to the first part.</p><p>“It’s a little difficult,” Xi hesitated for a moment and said, “Because Xu Xiaoshou suddenly attacked and sent the Kun Peng God Envoy flying with a punch…”</p><p>“Elder Yu was sent flying by a single punch?”</p><p>Killing intent instantly appeared in Dao Xuanji’s eyes.</p><p>She felt that it was only right and proper for her body to be cut off considering her level.</p><p>After all, she had been influenced by the power of guidance and underestimation of the enemy. As a Divine Sorceress, she had chosen the most disadvantageous method of confrontation. It was normal for her to lose.</p><p>But who was Elder Yu?</p><p>His original form was the Kun Peng Sacred Beast, and his physical strength was boundless.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou hadn’t transformed into that giant, how could he have been sent flying with a single punch?</p><p>If he really transformed…</p><p>Just outside the Jade Capital City, and the Saint Hall couldn’t see it?</p><p>“Who is he acting for!” Dao Xuanji’s expression was slightly angry. “Call him over too!”</p><p>“It’s still a little difficult,” Xi did not dare to stop, “It’s mainly because Xu Xiaoshou announced his intention for the Sacred Mountain after he beat up Elder Yu. He even overturned the Xuanji Formation in one fell swoop…”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>“What?” Dao Xuanji slammed the table and stood up. “You’re only telling me about such an important matter now?” She said angrily.</p><p>Xi was stunned.</p><p>He thought to himself, “It’s very important, so don’t interrupt me!”</p><p>Xi looked over in a daze and thought of more. “I thought Hallmaster Xuanji knew…”</p><p>The Xuanji great array was personally created by Dao Xuanji.</p><p>As a Divine Sorceress at the Saint Stage, she didn’t know anything about her things being destroyed?</p><p>Did this mean…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had cut off her entire body, and she had yet to fully recover? Xi did not dare to think further.</p><p>The Ninth Divine Priest and Beibei looked back at Dao Xuanji at the same time, as if they had thought of the same thing.</p><p>“Are you alright?” The Ninth Divine Priest sounded worried.</p><p>“I’m fine,” Dao Xuanji waved her hand and took two deep breaths, feeling her head swell.</p><p>Not only was she angry, but she was also angered by Xu Xiaoshou’s impudent actions. After all, she had just made a promise to protect the Jade Capital City for a hundred years…</p><p>“What else do you have?” Dao Xuanji regained her calm.</p><p>“Yes!” Xi was now certain that Hallmaster Xuanji really didn’t know anything about the outside world. How serious was her injury?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou threatened to blow up Jade Capital City and topple Sacred Mountain. He has the intention of killing his way up to Sacred Mountain.” Xi did not dare to delay. He cupped his fists and bowed his head as he hurriedly said.</p><p>Dao Xuanji waited for a moment.</p><p>Xi also waited for a while. After waiting for a while, he raised his head and looked at Hallmaster Xuanji.</p><p>“Continue,” Dao Xuanji raised her hand.</p><p>Xi felt awkward, “Uh, there isn’t anything else…”</p><p>The great hall suddenly fell silent.</p><p>Beibei hissed and hid behind Lord Nine Sacrifices, “Xi, how dare you? Are you playing with me?”</p><p>The atmosphere in the hall became extremely oppressive!</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s head buzzed and she felt the world in front of her become a little blurry. She didn’t know if it was because of her headache or if it was the aftereffects of being cut off.</p><p>After she stood up abruptly, she saw that Xi was as quiet as a cicada in winter. She swallowed her anger and her brain hurt even more.</p><p>She didn’t flare up and just ordered,</p><p>“Tell the three Saints, especially Yu Kunpeng, to stop Xu Xiaoshou with all their might. Jade Capital City cannot be damaged.”</p><p>“I will personally repair the Xuanji array…He can only attack the great array when I am not present!”</p><p>“Beibei, get ready. Follow Xi and challenge him if necessary. Remember to pick a good time. Don’t pick a time when he’s angry. He might not accept it.”</p><p>Challenge?</p><p>Xi glanced at Beibei, who looked younger than him and raised an eyebrow.</p><p>It can’t be the kind of challenge he was thinking of, right?</p><p>“Understood!” After Beibei received the order, she picked up the sword case and walked to the entrance of the hall. She gestured to Xi, who was also an ancient sword cultivator, “Shall we go?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
