These things would interweave together and form a new contradiction called “Xu Xiaoshou”!</p><p>He would stand on the opposite side of the world.</p><p>With the support of the Body of Devour and Xu Xiaoshou’s shocking talent, the Five Great Holy Emperor Families were all alarmed.</p><p>The moment the Ghost Beast Contract was torn…</p><p>Bazhun’an in his youth had retreated to the secondary position.</p><p>In today’s world, the ruler of chaos in the Dark World and the leader of all the paths had to change his name to Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“Dissuaded, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Surprised, Passive Points, +4.”</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points +9999.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>As the city suddenly fell silent and Fang Wenxin shouted, “No!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held the Ghost Beast Contract and smiled.</p><p>“I once thought that Greedy the Cat Spirit was my trump card. When I was in my most difficult time, I could use the contract book to contract it and save myself from danger…I was wrong. I was too selfish.”</p><p>“I once thought that forming a contract with a ghost beast was equivalent to completely binding the two worlds together. They were like water and milk. Once mixed, there will be no distinction between them…I was wrong again. Someone told me from experience that humans and ghost beasts can live in harmony.”</p><p>“It seems that the inertia of thinking has led everyone to be deeply secretive about this matter. Therefore, they hide and lock the secret behind an extremely high position, regarding it with extreme significance…”</p><p>After a pause, Xu Xiaoshou’s face was filled with suspicion.</p><p>“But is there a possibility that everyone has placed too much, perhaps excessive, value on it?”</p><p>“Is the root of the silence born from fear because the truth has been distorted or manipulated through guidance?”</p><p>“It’s not important. It’s not important anymore.”</p><p>“I once promised a red-clothed person that I would find the answer myself. Now that I have the ability, I’m here to fulfill my promise.”</p><p>He raised the Ghost Beast Contract high up. Under the illumination of the sunlight, everything glowed faintly.</p><p>“At least, in my eyes now…”</p><p>“This contract is just a way to deepen the connection between me and my friend. That’s all.”</p><p>Puff! Puff!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, white flames appeared on Xu Xiaoshou’s hand and burned the Ghost Beast Contract to ashes in front of everyone.</p><p>“No-”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen cried out in alarm, her eyes filled with panic and anxiety. Suddenly, she realized something, “Eh?”</p><p>The Ghost Beast Contract disappeared.</p><p>However, the power within did not come out.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou only burned the item and didn’t choose to contract it?</p><p>“Glared At, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Tears welled up in Yu Zhiwen’s eyes. Her cheeks turned red, and she was about to burn a hole through Xu Xiaoshou with her glare.</p><p>Why was he still joking at a time like this?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around in front of everyone and smiled at her. “I don’t dare to believe or use the things given by Xu Yue Grey Palace.”</p><p>What did he mean?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen had just wiped away the tears from the corner of her eyes when her eyes suddenly trembled.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stepped on the Spiritual Array Disc and drew the outline of the Divine Secret with his hands. He actually weaved a brand new bloodline contract book with the contents of the Ghost Beast Contract as the root!</p><p>“Greedy the Cat Spirit.”</p><p>This call was accompanied by the spinning of the contract.</p><p>It was so fast that no one could react in time. It hit the soul of Greedy the Cat Spirit who was captured by the Ten Thousand Ghost Soul Capture Technique from afar.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit struggled violently and resisted subconsciously. Suddenly, its nine tails drooped down and its scarlet eyes moved. It turned its head stiffly and said,</p><p>“Meow?”</p><p>A ferocious beast actually let out such a hesitant meow. It carried a faint doubt, as well as a thick expectation that had been waiting for a long time.</p><p>The corners of Xu Xiaoshou’s lips curled up as he looked over with a gentle smile.</p><p>“I no longer wish to rely on my perception to understand what you are saying to me. This is too complicated…”</p><p>“I want to hear your voice, the most direct and authentic voice.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
