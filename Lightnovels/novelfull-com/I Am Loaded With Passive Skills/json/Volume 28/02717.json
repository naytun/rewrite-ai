When they looked again, all they saw was the eye-catching sight of Xu Xiaoshou, who was dressed in black.</p><p>As for the Hallmaster Xuanji, no one knew her whereabouts.</p><p>“Dao Xuanji had been slain by my sword!”</p><p>“The three of you are my respected seniors. The outcome of this battle has already been decided. There’s no need to continue.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said this calmly and put away his sword.</p><p>Hidden Bitter coiled around his arm like a snake and seemed eager to continue.</p><p>The three Saints were stunned when they heard what he said.</p><p>Was it over?</p><p>On the Southern Zone wall, Yu Zhiwen snapped out of her trance and quickly reached out her hands to grab something in front of her.</p><p>She had clearly caught some of the warmth.</p><p>She hurriedly turned around, but there was no one behind her.</p><p>Her star pupils looked toward the north, but all she saw was the bleak snow.</p><p>“Supreme Master is dead…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen lowered her head and looked at her empty hands with a complicated gaze. It was as if she had lost something precious, and her heart was empty.</p><p>In Jade Capital City, a huge commotion erupted.</p><p>“Hallmaster Xuanji is dead?”</p><p>“That’s impossible, she just took office!”</p><p>“A new official will change things when he or she takes over, but she got burned instead?”</p><p>“She’s a demi-saint! Didn’t a demi-saint have many means to resist? Even if she was at a disadvantage for a moment… demi-saints can’t be killed!”</p><p>The demi-saint was indeed out of reach.</p><p>To ordinary people, it was the peak of this world’s combat strength.</p><p>However, demi-saints were not immortals. This had been proven many times on Abyss Island.</p><p>“Lord Shou has killed more than one Saint…”</p><p>After the commotion in Jade Capital City boiled over, it suddenly became quiet as if the raging fire had been extinguished.</p><p>It was unknown who recalled it first and he said faintly.</p><p>“I remember that the previous Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace was also beheaded by the… Seven Sword Deity?”</p><p>This sentence ignited like a raging inferno and instantly burnt the dead silence in the city to ashes.</p><p>“You Tu!”</p><p>“Now that you mention it, wasn’t Lord Shou’s action exactly the same as what the previous Seven Sword Deity You Tu did?”</p><p>“The only difference was that at that time, You Tu was old, and the old Hallmaster was also old. Now, Lord Shou is young, and Hallmaster Xuanji…”</p><p>“Hallmaster Xuanji isn’t young!”</p><p>The soundproof array formation of Jade Capital City had long been destroyed by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>When the heated discussion in the city reached the ears of the three Saints of the Holy Divine Palace, Yu, Fang, and Zhong’s expressions became extremely excited.</p><p>Although he was unwilling to admit it, Xu Xiaoshou was just a young man, yet he could do this.</p><p>He could even be compared to You Tu!</p><p>However, it seemed that the truth was…</p><p>While his peers were still searching for the path, he had already fulfilled his talent and potential. He had surpassed the era and walked before the older generation!</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>Elder Yu turned to look at Fang Wenxin.</p><p>He didn’t try to seek Zhong Yuanzi’s opinion. There was no need for that.</p><p>Fang Wenxin let out a deep sigh, suppressed all the waves, and shook his head slowly.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The ghost beast Greedy the Cat Spirit jumped out from the black hole in the sky.</p><p>There was a faint smell of time on its body!</p><p>Elder Yu turned his head and immediately knew why Fang Wenxin made that choice.</p><p>Regardless whether Dao Xuanji lived or died, whether she was defeated or had retreated, the older generation of the red-clothed people could not leave the battlefield.</p><p>Because the ghost beast, Greedy the Cat Spirit was still here!</p><p>The original intention of the birth of the red-clothed people was to maintain the world’s order, eliminate the ghost beasts of other dimensions that could cause trouble in the human world, and uphold true justice.</p><p>Even though now, there were fewer people who adhered to this path.</p><p>Some people walked on and on and when they reached the elites level, they forgot their original intentions…</p><p>Fang Wenxin did not.</p><p>The white shadows of the copper coins were filled with resentment, but the blood stained red-clothed people had no regrets.</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was furious when he saw Greedy the Cat Spirit who caused so much trouble. He kicked it hard.</p><p>There seemed to be a mistake in the time.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit did not manage to dodge the attack, but Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had kicked only the air.</p><p>With a turn of its head, Greedy the Cat Spirit’s nine tails brought all kinds of power. It included the power of the ancestral source, and bombarded the Xuanji great array in Jade Capital City.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The unmanned great array was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit was not happy about this. It stuck its head out and pounced toward the sky.</p><p>“Ah!!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian, who had been trapped in the air and was like a kite that watched the entire scene, let out a strange cry.</p><p>He dodged Greedy the Cat Spirit’s fangs.</p><p>There seemed to be an error in the time again.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian had clearly dodged the attack, but Greedy the Cat Spirit seemed to have bitten him before he could dodge.</p><p>The tongue wrapped around him and darkness engulfed everything.</p><p>“Save me!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!” Ye Xiaotian’s hysterical yells could be heard from the mouth of Greedy the Cat Spirit. “I wanted to tell you this before, but can you save me before you go out and fight?!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was slightly alarmed.</p><p>Elder Yu had kicked Greedy the Cat Spirit into the time fragment. Had it actually found some method to use time?</p><p>This was beyond belief!</p><p>If we delayed any longer, even if the heavens came, they would not be able to take it away!</p><p>However, just as he was about to make a move, Fang Wenxin had already reached for the copper coins slung around his waist. He tossed all nine of them and suspended them in the air in front of him.</p><p>“Zhen!”</p><p>Thump thump thump…</p><p>The nine Blood Shadow copper coins were all arranged in a row. They let out a low groan as if someone had stroked them.</p><p>The strange vibration frequency gradually deepened, and finally evolved into a very high-pitched and strange tone.</p><p>“Eh…”</p><p>It went on until it became inaudible to one’s ears!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
