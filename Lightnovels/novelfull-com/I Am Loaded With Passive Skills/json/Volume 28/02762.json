After all, it requires the origin blood to perfectly activate the Origin Lei Family’s Eyes…”</p><p>“I can’t handle this! However, I can ask Xuan Wuji to help. I’ll exchange your blood for my little junior sister, and my junior sister’s blood for Lei Shuangxing. As for Lei Shuangxing’s…Uh, throw it away.”</p><p>“Are you satisfied now? Apologized? Is everyone happy with this outcome”</p><p>Lei Shuangxing almost pulled out his Divine-beating Crutch.</p><p>Xuan Wuji, who was far away from the scene, froze. He thought, “What did it have to do with me? I was just watching the show…”</p><p>But it had to be said!</p><p>Watching such a show up close was an amazing experience!</p><p>The information bar popped up as if it had been provoked.</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points +3849.”</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points +2666.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen almost forgot what she wanted to do.</p><p>This was how emotions were. Once they were interrupted, they would not be full.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen looked down at her locked hands, her pale lips squirmed, and tears flowed out of her eyes. She begged,</p><p>“Let go of me…”</p><p>“Alright.” Xu Xiaoshou let go of Yu Zhiwen’s hand and neck.</p><p>Everyone was stunned and silent.</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points +6689.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was also petrified.</p><p>However, she reacted in an instant.</p><p>The ten severed fingers, controlled by the divine path pattern, moved like a Divine Puppet, swiftly reaching for her own eyes once again.</p><p>“You still want to do it again?”</p><p>Shocked, Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly used his hand to knock the girl’s neck.</p><p>The latter’s body went limp and was about to fall to the ground. He picked her up by the waist.</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>With such a “sinner” in his arms, Xu Xiaoshou turned around and felt uneasy.</p><p>He had clearly decided not to interfere…</p><p>Forget it!</p><p>It’s all this girl’s fault for being too stupid!</p><p>He looked at Lei Shuangxing. “Although she took action without your permission, I think even you don’t want to see her dig…”</p><p>Lei Shuangxing opened his mouth and interrupted without any emotion, “Every grievance has its source, and every debt has its owner.”</p><p>Then he understood.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded heavily as he thought, “Lei Shuangxing, you’re a real man, you are responsible!”</p><p>As he hugged Yu Zhiwen, he suddenly felt a chill at the back of his head. He tilted his head and twitched twice before he looked back at Lei Xi’er.</p><p>“Received cold stare, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s eyes were slightly watery.</p><p>There was no expression on her face, but the God Devil Eyes were spinning at high speed under her eyes. Black and white mist even splashed out of her pupils.</p><p>Her cold gaze moved from Yu Zhiwen’s body to the hand that was holding Yu Zhiwen, and then to Xu Xiaoshou’s face.</p><p>She didn’t say anything and just stared coldly into Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes.</p><p>It was extremely uncomfortable!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt Dao Xuanji wake up behind him. She was secretly poking his back with a needle-like gaze, which made his hair stand on end.</p><p>He opened his mouth and was about to speak.</p><p>“Heh.” Lei Xi’er’s red lips curled up.</p><p>“Huh?” Xu Xiaoshou was like a sensitive muscle that exploded at the slightest touch.</p><p>He didn’t even turn his head and threw Yu Zhiwen to Elder Yu, who was about to attack. “Keep an eye on her. Don’t let her do anything stupid again.”</p><p>Once the telepathic communication ended, he finally turned around, his back now straightening considerably.</p><p>“What was that ‘heh’ for!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er did not make any strange sounds.</p><p>She raised her eyebrows with a hint of disdain. She turned her face to the side and looked away from Xu Xiaoshou’s fierce face. She glanced at Lei Shuangxing and said,</p><p>“I’ve settled the score. It’s time to make a move.”</p><p>“Ignored, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>For the first time, Xu Xiaoshou felt provoked by a silent gaze.</p><p>He accidentally caught a glimpse of the strange expressions of the saints around him, and he immediately felt even more embarrassed.</p><p>His face stiffened as he shouted,</p><p>“I didn’t do anything!”</p><p>“I just stopped something that a normal person would have stopped!”</p><p>“Yu…Even if she wants to apologize, it shouldn’t be now, let alone in this way…”</p><p>“Heh.”</p><p>His sharp teeth and sharp mouth stopped abruptly, and his face turned ashen.</p><p>The nine tails behind him stood up, and the pores all over his body opened up like a hedgehog that had exploded!</p><p>Of course, he wasn’t going to make a move.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried to explain again.</p><p>“Pfft.”</p><p>At this moment, an extremely faint snicker suddenly came from the back.</p><p>It was even more ear-piercing than the saint calamity!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glared at the source of the voice.</p><p>Xuan Wuji covered his mouth with both hands, his expression extremely terrified. He said repeatedly,</p><p>“I’m sorry, Lord Shou. Listen to me. Uh, no, in short, it’s not what you think. I’m not laughing…”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Before he could finish, Xuan Wuji felt like his head was being grabbed.</p><p>A golden giant appeared and lifted him up. After flipping him in the air for two rounds, he smashed him down into the air.</p><p>“I’ll make you laugh!!!”</p><p>Xuan Wuji’s expression twisted as he lost control of his body.</p><p>“Lord Shou! I’m Liu Changqing, I’m Liu Changqing, he went in…Ah, damn it, come out! You’re the one laughing, not me…Ah-”</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were attracted by the sudden accident.</p><p>After the guy who called himself Liu Changqing fell, the receiver in the void had already dispelled the golden giant and returned to his human appearance.</p><p>His expression was indifferent, and there was no trace of embarrassment on his face. He extended his hand forward, his expression elegant and calm.</p><p>Yes, no one could make Xu Xiaoshou feel awkward.</p><p>If there was…</p><p>Time Reversal!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took out Time Ancestor Shadow Staff and looked at Lei Xi’er from afar.</p><p>“Heh.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er lowered her eyes and looked away. She couldn’t be bothered with this childish ghost.</p><p>When she looked at the other side, the God Devil Eyes suddenly trembled and she opened her eyes.</p><p>A sudden change occurred!</p><p>She saw people surrounding the Jade Capital City.</p><p>The location of Dao Xuanji, which had been temporarily forgotten and contaminated by the Fourth Sword’s ferocious demonic aura.</p><p>Although the black devilish energy was still surging…</p><p>At this moment, an extremely eye-catching green color flashed inside!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
