The latter suddenly suppressed Senior Wei Feng.”</p><p>“I was outside the Black Water Stream and watched as the two of them escaped from the entrance of the god slayer ruins. I was about to challenge Xu Xiaoshou when the Holy Emperor Fengtian blocked me with another strike.”</p><p>Beibei looked very angry. She jumped back into her seat and said with a helpless look.</p><p>“There was no way to fight at all!”</p><p>“Fortunately, they were all sucked into the ruins.”</p><p>She wasn’t even a demi-saint, so how could she withstand a blow from the Holy Emperor Fengtian Feng Yujin?</p><p>His combat level was too high!</p><p>The Ninth Divine Priest, who was dressed in a palace robe and had a translucent spiritual physique, looked over.</p><p>“So you’re sure that the two of them have entered the god slayer ruins. The Holy Emperor Fengtian can’t return, and Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>She paused for a moment, and there was a hint of doubt on her face.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang’s real-time battle report from the Qingyuan Mountain stated that he killed Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>“After he entered his world, he found Xu Xiaoshou’s main body, but he was unconscious.”</p><p>“When the ghost beast Greedy the Cat Spirit appeared at the Southern Zone gate, Xu Xiaoshou was there, but he committed suicide.”</p><p>“Now even though he was killed… hmm, yes, there is still a Xu Xiaoshou outside Jade Capital City. His combat strength even superseded the previous one!”</p><p>“Then…”</p><p>“Who was that Xu Xiaoshou?” The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body asked a philosophical question.</p><p>Beibei was stunned. She pondered for a long time before she said, “Who knows? There must be a reason why there were so many rumors outside that he is one person with thousands of descendants. They could all be Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“But Dao Qiongcang concluded that there were at most only two Xu Xiaoshou. He told me himself.” The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body looked at Dao Xuanji.</p><p>At this moment, only Dao Xuanji was left to solve this question. Although she had just been killed, the forte of a Divine Sorceress was not direct combat.</p><p>“My apologies.” The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body apologized for her slip of the tongue and rudeness. She couldn’t stop herself and had said the word ‘kill’.</p><p>“Lord Nine Sacrifices, there is no harm in speaking frankly. This is the truth.” Dao Xuanji was rather magnanimous and said calmly.</p><p>“For the Holy Emperor Fengtian, based on my understanding of him, once he entered the god slayer ruins, he won’t come back on his own accord. We can eliminate the Saint Servant’s combat strength.”</p><p>“Back to Xu Xiaoshou. Although, there can only be two of himself at the same time, and their combat strength seemed to be the same, they are actually very different in nature.”</p><p>Her words piqued the interest of the two people beside her. Beibei grabbed the edge of the table. “Please elaborate, Hallmaster Xuanji.”</p><p>Dao Xuanji recounted the feelings she encountered previously.</p><p>“I deliberately put myself in danger to confirm the fact that Xu Xiaoshou had received an inheritance similar to the ‘enlightenment’.”</p><p>“This included his Divine Secret, spiritual array technique, disguise technique, and perhaps his conducting alchemy technique and the Ancient Sword Technique.”</p><p>“Oh?” Beibei’s eyes lit up when she heard that. “Didn’t Xu Xiaoshou learn the Ancient Sword Technique himself? That’s what I told you!”</p><p>The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body was also surprised. Xuanji had mentioned this theory before, but she didn’t elaborate on it.</p><p>Because if she was not sure, she would not say much.</p><p>However, after just one battle, Xuanji had figured everything out?</p><p>Dao Xuanji took a deep breath. After she had calmed down after the battle, she sorted out all the information about Xu Xiaoshou and organized them.</p><p>“He knows a lot about the Divine Secrets, but he understands very little. This doesn’t seem like an ability he cultivated himself.”</p><p>“His Way of Spirit Array had always only displayed the power to break arrays and improve on them. This can be seen from the traces of array activation of the Eight Trigrams Pilgrimage Map array in the Pilgrimage Tower in the Eastern Region, that was the former site of the First Pavilion in the Sky. He only knows how to borrow arrays, not create them.”</p><p>“The same example can be seen in the presentation of his conducting alchemy skills. His conducting alchemy skills are extremely high, but the time he spent in its cultivation is extremely short.”</p><p>“I’ve consulted the top Elixir Masters from the Magic Pill Technicians Association in the City of the Living Bodhisattva. I asked them to analyze Xu Xiaoshou’s ridiculous ‘black chicken conducting alchemy technique’ at the Eastern Region conducting alchemy convention…”</p><p>“How was it?” The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body and Beibei asked at the same time.</p><p>They were also aware of this matter. After all, there had been more than one meeting on the Sacred Mountain that was targeted at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>From the Tiangsang Spirit Palace to Abyss Island, everything that needed to be studied had been studied. However, at that time, Hallmaster Dao did not give an answer with regards to Xu Xiaoshou’s conducting alchemy skills.</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s tone was filled with disdain as she said.</p><p>“The conclusion was that his conducting alchemy skills are not strong. It can even be said that his conducting alchemy skills are extremely ordinary, and his alchemy technique is extremely poor.”</p><p>“His strength lies in his understanding of medicinal ingredients and medicinal properties, as well as his control of the temperature of fire. All of these required a lot of time to accumulate.”</p><p>After a pause, Dao Xuanji changed the topic.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou has only been famous for a year. Even if he has a piece of blessed land, he can’t master so many things if he cultivated at different times!”</p><p>“The only explanation is that someone ‘enlightened’ him and instilled the legacy into him. What he did was to digest and evolve, a little at a time!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
