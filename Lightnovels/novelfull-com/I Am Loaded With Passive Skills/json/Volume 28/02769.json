Why didn’t the demi-saints come out to fight? Why did they send a little girl instead?”</p><p>“Had Hallmaster Xuanji suffered such a sudden and brutal death that her troops resorted to send out such a thing?”</p><p>Naturally, some people quickly recognized Beibei.</p><p>“Brother, that’s the Seven Sword Deity, the Ruler of the white-clothed people! Her name is Beibei!”</p><p>“Beibei? Sword Deity? Then let me ask you, is Xu Xiaoshou a Sword Deity?”</p><p>“Uh, yes…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is still a Spiritual Cultivator who has mastered the Life Upanishad Life. Beibei? Sword Deity?”</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is also a Divine Sorcerer. He can control the Xuanji great array and instantly kill Hallmaster Xuanji. Beibei? Sword Deity?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is also…”</p><p>“Enough, how can you boost the morale of others and diminish your own prestige!”</p><p>“Brother, you can’t lie to yourself and deceive others. You’re being blindly arrogant. He’s Xu Xiaoshou, he’s Lord Shou!”</p><p>“… That’s true.”</p><p>In the end, the dawn of Jade Capital City had yet to arrive.</p><p>Everyone seemed to know in advance what the outcome would be. The mighty Sword Deity was like a small soldier, being used as cannon fodder in the battle!</p><p>Such a desperate situation could be seen clearly when she was high up in the sky.</p><p>Even though Beibei had a good temperament, she was still angry at the mournful atmosphere in Jade Capital City.</p><p>Defeat was not scary.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao had admitted that he had lost the battle on Abyss Island!</p><p>However, he worked hard after that. He was still able to set up a plan from the Four Symbols Secret Realm and borrowed the power of the Holy Emperor. He thought out each step carefully and almost caught the arrogant Xu Xiaoshou on Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>If not for Xuan…</p><p>Sigh, forget it.</p><p>Let’s not bring it up.</p><p>The scary thing was that her heart energy was gone!</p><p>Wasn’t the current situation in Jade Capital City a sign that everyone couldn’t see what the future would be like and all their hearts were defeated by Xu Xiaoshou’s sword?</p><p>The unity of the city was strong!</p><p>So much dejection, what was going on?</p><p>Beibei held the Emperor’s Sword and her clothes fluttered in the wind. She stared at Xu Xiaoshou and her aura slowly gathered. Finally, she said.</p><p>“I am…”</p><p>“You’re the Ruler of the white-clothed people and the Seven Sword Deity. Why aren’t you qualified to challenge me? Xu Xiaoshou interrupted her with a flick of his sleeve and spoke on her behalf</p><p>Ah! D*mn it…</p><p>Beibei’s aura subsided. It was bad enough that she was interrupted. She tried to speak and again Xu Xiaoshou interrupted her.</p><p>“Listen! In my presence, you even used the word ‘qualified’.”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter if we fight or not. From the very beginning, you’ve placed yourself below me. How can you defeat me like this?”</p><p>Beibei almost had a cerebral hemorrhage and she retorted. “What’s this about ‘qualified’ or not, it’s all your own words. I didn’t say anything!”</p><p>“Alright, let’s not talk about ‘qualified’. Let’s talk about something else…” Xu Xiaoshou looked at Supreme Emperor Sword and reached into the void. He produced Fourth Sword with a brandish as he shouted.</p><p>“You have the Emperor’s Sword, and I have the Vicious Sword. They are all Five Great Instruments of Chaos.”</p><p>“You are one of the Seven Sword Deity, and I am also one of the Seven Sword Deity. Alright, let’s just say that you were ranked above me.”</p><p>“However, other than this, you are honest but poor. To me, the vicious sword and Sword Deity are all additional titles…”</p><p>After a pause, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes blazed. His thunderous voice echoed all over as he shouted,</p><p>“My status is above yours!”</p><p>“What do you have to defeat me? Your passion and your own emotions?”</p><p>Beibei’s chest heaved as she panted heavily. She tried to speak…</p><p>“You can’t beat me even if I lend you a hand.” Xu Xiaoshou interrupted coldly.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!” Beibei closed her eyes and shouted, her face scrunched up.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Can you let me say something?”</p><p>“Alright, go ahead.</p><p>A deathly silence descended upon the surroundings.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were on the flustered Beibei, even those in Jade Capital City… She was the center of everyone’s attention.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Beibei’s brain suddenly short-circuited.</p><p>Speak?</p><p>Yes, what was I supposed to say?</p><p>What did I want to say just now?</p><p>The words that she had prepared to set off the scene, flaunt the sword power and reverse the decline of Jade Capital City were all forgotten after this interruption!</p><p>One breath, two breaths, three breaths later…</p><p>Beibei finally remembered something, but Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t wait any longer. He frowned and said.</p><p>“I said to go ahead and speak, so why didn’t you say anything? Is it because you don’t like to talk?”</p><p>“Since that’s the case, why were you still so brazen as to ask me to give you time to talk?”</p><p>“I thought you had some profound thoughts to share, something shocking. Perhaps you want to be like that Eighth Sword Deity and recite a poem before you fight…”</p><p>“Ah, shut up!” Beibei almost spat out a mouthful of blood. She waved her sword and broke the spell.</p><p>She didn’t dare to delay any longer and chose to get straight to the point. She took out the bronze invitation letter from her pocket.</p><p>“I have come this time around for…”</p><p>“Oh, right!” High up in the sky, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly slapped his thigh and turned to Master Siren and ignored his opponent’s intentions.</p><p>“Beibei, you’re a junior.”</p><p>“Master Siren is right here. You haven’t even greeted him and you’ve already embarrassed yourself. How dare you ignore a Senior?”</p><p>“Oh, now that you’ve become the new Seven Sword Deity, you don’t care about any of the old ones, do you? You’re really something else, Beibei!”</p><p>Beibei clung to the invitation letter and she seemed to have lost her focus. She could not speak for a long time, as if her speech function had gone haywire.</p><p>Her current mood was akin to a cow that chewed grass and had just eaten the toughest part of the root. Just as she was about to tear it off and swallow it, she realized that it was coated with a pile of dog shit!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
