It opened its mouth and forcefully drew in the delicious Life force from those faces that were so close.</p><p>Just as it was about to feast, a leg, a human leg reeking of alcohol swung at it.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit was sent flying!</p><p>The dream then entered a long cycle.</p><p>During this cycle, there were spiritual plants, gems, Elixirs… everything it could want.</p><p>Whenever it called out, someone would bring it food.</p><p>Even so, Greedy the Cat Spirit still endured a relentless “hunger.”</p><p>It had always been believed that this hunger was something all living beings had to suffer through.</p><p>Until it was taken out of that place known as Xu Yue Grey Palace and brought into a strange, yet vibrant, new world.</p><p>This marked the end of the dream’s cycle.</p><p>Driven by hunger, Greedy the Cat Spirit secretly devoured the Life force of this new world, drawing from the essence of various plants.</p><p>The two guardians weren’t particularly strong, so they didn’t seem to notice.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit finally realized it was different from other life forms. Its only sustenance was “life” itself.</p><p>Replenishing its Life force could slightly suppress that innate hunger.</p><p>Eventually, the guardians noticed something was off and loosened some restrictions. They often brought various potent spiritual medicines brimming with vitality.</p><p>The dream entered a recovery phase.</p><p>But it was never enough. The hunger couldn’t be eradicated, only slightly alleviated.</p><p>If it was only consuming spiritual medicines rich in Life force, the quantity required was far too great…</p><p>The guardians were always vigilant about one thing.</p><p>They never allowed it to come into contact with the real food it yearned for the most, the essence of all life that it had wanted to devour from the moment it was born—Life itself!</p><p>As time passed…</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit also came to understand that this wasn’t a good thing.</p><p>Consuming blood and devouring Life would lead to dire consequences.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit had already realized it was a Saint Beast, a supreme life form in their eyes.</p><p>As such a powerful existence, it seemed only natural to learn to endure and suppress its instincts.</p><p>This shift in perspective occurred because the dream had changed, entering an adventure phase.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit had met a special human.</p><p>He smelled too delicious!</p><p>He radiated a more fatal allure than any other being, constantly tempting it to leap toward him!</p><p>As long as it asked, it could have it.</p><p>As long as it got close, it could stave off its hunger.</p><p>The vitality breath he exuded wasn’t the highest it had ever encountered, but it was rare because it was endless!</p><p>He fulfilled Greedy the Cat Spirit’s vision of perfection.</p><p>The adventure phase of the dream was the most beautiful. Without many obstacles, it transitioned into the sweet dream phase, where that person chose to stay by Greedy the Cat Spirit’s side.</p><p>He had a small world.</p><p>He placed it in that world rich with vitality spiritual energy, allowing it to play and devour spiritual medicine at will.</p><p>He would go out hunting for long periods, but every time he returned, his Life force would become even more delicious.</p><p>He never refused its requests. Though sometimes he would push it away symbolically, as long as it pounced on him again, he didn’t mind.</p><p>He changed its perspective. As long as it avoided the “taboo,” a Saint Beast should act freely, devouring Life force as it pleased.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit once believed it had found the best pet in the world!</p><p>His self-discipline made him even more delicious.</p><p>His devotion made the world brimming with vitality.</p><p>He was so pious that he offered up a method to condense Life force into Elixirs using fire and bathing tools, making them even more delectable.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit found joy in conducting alchemy.</p><p>With only a small investment of time and effort, it could obtain the king of delicious foods.</p><p>That sense of accomplishment and happiness was even more fulfilling than the effortless harvests from its time in Xu Yue Grey Palace!</p><p>Life quietly progressed.</p><p>But the sweet dream ended, giving way to the nightmare phase.</p><p>It couldn’t pinpoint when it started, but Greedy the Cat Spirit realized that its pet didn’t always return from hunting unscathed.</p><p>Sometimes, he came back injured, severely so!</p><p>He needed to stay in the Yuan Mansion world for a while to regain his vitality.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit suddenly realized that maybe he wasn’t its pet, but rather its owner.</p><p>And it, who had been pampered and provided for, was the pet.</p><p>But that didn’t matter!</p><p>The shift in the owner-pet dynamic meant nothing to Greedy the Cat Spirit, as long as he continued to thrive.</p><p>But the nightmare only grew worse…</p><p>Each time he returned from hunting, his injuries were more grievous than before.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit grew anxious, but it couldn’t offer any support or aid. Its master never asked for its help.</p><p>Guests frequently visited the Yuan Mansion world.</p><p>Through their conversations, or the musings of the ponytailed girl who often shared her thoughts while holding her…</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit began to understand more about the world beyond its comfort.</p><p>It started to want more!</p><p>It wanted to converse, to stay by his side, to fight alongside him, to leave this world, to walk beside him, not be sheltered behind him.</p><p>The reason a nightmare was a nightmare was because nothing ever went as people wished.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
