The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body fell into deep thought. “Little Dao actually mentioned a similar guess to me…”</p><p>Dao Xuanji immediately turned to look at her.</p><p>She didn’t like her brother, but she recognized his ability.</p><p>The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body sighed. “But you know his personality. He was in the process of verification. Perhaps he had already obtained the answer, but he betrayed the Sacred Mountain…”</p><p>Dao Xuanji couldn’t help but mock. “He pursued perfection and was very careful in everything he did. However, he was not aware that this would also limit his actions. Some things can be confirmed even when there is a 30% chance.”</p><p>Beibei didn’t comment. “Is it possible that Xu Xiaoshou is a genius?” She suggested. “He seems to know everything.”</p><p>Dao Xuanji glanced over coldly. “Have you ever met anyone who is talented like Kui Leihan, The Divine, and Bazhun’an? Who is on par with all of them or even surpassed them?”</p><p>“There is none…” Beibei mumbled, but she felt that her guess was not entirely impossible.</p><p>There were none in the past, but now there could be one!</p><p>She still held a grudge against Xu Xiaoshou for spilling the tea on her. This person was not only talented, but also had a bad personality!</p><p>The Nine Sacrificial Osmanthus had a clearer picture.</p><p>She didn’t care if Xu Xiaoshou was really a genius, but she cared about Dao Xuanji’s intention when she brought up this matter.</p><p>“So?”</p><p>Dao Xuanji was perceptive and said with confidence.</p><p>“That’s why any power similar to the inheritance received by Xu Xiaoshou can be mastered by observing it, grasped by seeing it and broken when it is understood. If we want to defeat him, we have to look for other aspects.”</p><p>“Furthermore, his incarnation should only be able to inherit the power he had received. As for other aspects, such as the power of the Dragon Ancestor, they have yet to be seen. Therefore, his incarnation usually would not fight to the death. It will only support him.”</p><p>“Only when his main body appears and he feels that he has a clone as a way out, will he do whatever he wants. Just like in Jade Capital City, the one that fought was his main body.”</p><p>“At this moment, the Clone remained hidden… The priorities were clear and the battle situation was clearly under control and a check and balance can be performed.”</p><p>“Actually…” The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body seemed to be deep in thought and hesitated.</p><p>“I know what you want to say, but it’s impossible.” Dao Xuanji didn’t listen. She leaned back, released her aura and directly rejected it.</p><p>There was a touch of anger in the Ninth Divine Priest’s eyes. She did not back down and instead remonstrated.</p><p>“I know that you don’t like to hear it, but I still have to say it!”</p><p>“At this moment, Ai Cangsheng is not here and Yue Gongli had also entered the ruins.”</p><p>“You also said that the one of the Three Emperors Wei Feng was taken away by Dao Qiongcang. Gou Wuyue escaped from the Dead Sea and there is no possibility of his return.”</p><p>“Yan Wuse and Number Two had fallen on Abyss Island earlier. Most of the people who could be of use to the Sacred Mountain died suddenly…”</p><p>“At this moment, the Holy Divine Palace faced the greatest shortage of manpower in decades. The Saint Servant is eyeing us covetously. Bazhun’an has yet to make a move. Xu Xiaoshou is at the height of his power. Even you… You were even killed!”</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s brows furrowed and her expression was icy cold.</p><p>Beibei’s eyes widened. She looked around and bit her lower lip as she tried to make her presence as invisible as possible.</p><p>This was the first time she had seen Lord Nine Sacrifices, who was always so gentle and kind to everyone, lose her temper.</p><p>How terrifying!</p><p>She actually dared to confront Hallmaster Xuanji so directly. Was a war about to start?</p><p>The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body didn’t stop talking. After she paused for a while, she said bluntly.</p><p>“Your internal problems have yet to be resolved, and our people have yet to return, yet you’ve already declared war on the Xu Yue Grey Palace and even the entire Southern Region. This would likely cause more external trouble.”</p><p>“What if Bazhun’an’s faction in the Southern Region made use of this opportunity to join forces with the Xu Yue Grey Palace?”</p><p>“When you use your weakness to attack the opponent’s strength and use an egg to hit a rock, how can we win?”</p><p>“I feel that your decision is not rational. You have been influenced by the power of guidance of the blood tree. It is very intense… Dao Xuanji, you need to calm down!”</p><p>The Saint Hall fell silent after her final shout.</p><p>Beibei trembled violently.</p><p>Don’t, I just got promoted and haven’t seen much of the world.</p><p>In the past, when the Council of Ten held a meeting, was it also like this?</p><p>Why did it seem a little different from what she had heard?</p><p>Dao Xuanji did not get angry.</p><p>She had no right to be angry at the Ancestral Tree that guarded the Sacred Mountain.</p><p>Not to mention her, no one in the Holy Divine Palace, the former Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang included, dared to be angry at the Ninth Divine Priest.</p><p>She waited for the Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body to calm down quickly and gave her a look that said, “I’m sorry, I’ve been rude, but I won’t apologize this time…” before she said.</p><p>“Lord Nine Sacrifices’ words are reasonable. I can explain it to you now.”</p><p>“Oh? Then why?” The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body returned to her seat. She folded her hands across her skirt and her gentle tone was back.</p><p>Dao Xuanji did not speak directly. She turned to Beibei. “What if you were to fight Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“Ah?” Beibei suddenly became the main topic of the conversation. She was stunned for a moment. When she regained her senses, her mouth was agape. “Me?”</p><p>“Yes, you!”</p><p>Beibei’s thoughts froze.</p><p>If you asked me this question at the Black Water Stream, my answer would be yes.</p><p>However, you’re a demi-saint. If you ask me this question after being killed by Xu Xiaoshou, my answer can only be…</p><p>“I’m not as good as him.”</p><p>Beibei admitted candidly.</p><p>She had wanted to fight him before, but when she thought about how Xu Xiaoshou could fight the Holy Emperor Qilin after he increased in size and how he had Master Siren as his support…</p><p>She only wanted to hold her sword and stay behind in the battlefield.</p><p>It would be too difficult to fight!</p><p>It was a thankless task!</p><p>If she wasn’t careful, she might end up like the previous Ruler of the white-clothed people and get shot in the head…</p><p>Speaking of which, Xu Xiaoshou had managed to blow up the Moonless Sword Deity’s head when he was at the Innate Stage. Now that she thought about it, there was a reason how he had achieved so much!</p><p>“Then if we put aside the other people and sects, in terms of the Ancient Sword Technique, how do you compare to him?” Dao Xuanji asked again.</p><p>“You mean…”</p><p>Beibei suddenly thought of something.</p><p>A duel between the ancient swordsmen?</p><p>That’s right, this was the time for the new Seven Sword Deity to fight for their honor.</p><p>In accordance with the rules, if she issued the battle invitation, Xu Xiaoshou had to accept it, and he couldn’t use other techniques during the battle.</p><p>Otherwise, the Feng family of the Southern Region would never acknowledge him as a Sword Deity.</p><p>And Bazhun’an had already given his answer with regard to the importance of ‘name’.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was his half-successor, and he had also learned the Witness Sword Technique. He would definitely want to compete for it.</p><p>He had cultivated his saber Hidden Bitter for so long and he had improved rapidly in the Witness Sword Technique. Any ancient swordsman would know why he had undergone sword cultivation. The Qingju Sword was the answer.</p><p>Hidden Bitter also needed the nourishment of the subsequent ‘name’…</p><p>She looked up and saw Dao Xuanji’s slight nod. Beibei knew that her guess was correct.</p><p>However, Hallmaster Xuanji’s proposal still needed to be weighed.</p><p>Beibei was very confident that she would be able to take on Xu Xiaoshou with the ancient swordsman cultivation method.</p><p>Now when she thought of what Hallmaster Xuanji had said, this fellow understood everything when he looked at it; he could grasp it by sight, and break it after he comprehended it…</p><p>“My sword. If he knows how to use it just from a mere glance, then I can’t fight him.” Beibei’s main point was honesty.</p><p>“This requires time and process.” Dao Xuanji said.</p><p>“But in the end, I still lost.” Beibei was unhappy. She pouted and muttered. “My ranking was higher than his!”</p><p>The two Elders Yi Xiao and Li Fuyu, together with Hua Lai and Bei Tian welcomed Lord Shou.</p><p>There was a ranking for this year’s Seven Sword Deity. Beibei’s initial ranking was just one rank higher than Xu Xiaoshou’s.</p><p>The original rule of the Seven Sword Deity was:</p><p>Candidates of the Seven Sword Deity could ask the Seven Sword Deity for a battle, and those who were at the lower ranks of the initial rankings could also challenge the ones at the higher ranks to a battle.</p><p>Although there was no restriction on how the higher ranked opponent could challenge the lower rank, no one would do so.</p><p>This was essentially bullying the weak!</p><p>All the ancient swordsman had to have the strength of character.</p><p>If he shamelessly fought with someone of a lower rank, he would end up being the loser because someone had stolen his technique…</p><p>Beibei felt terrible when she thought of this. Her whole body itched and she started to scratch it. She didn’t want to take the risk.</p><p>She could even fight those top ranked players but she did not wish to fight against Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>That fellow…</p><p>D*mn it!</p><p>It was so annoying!</p><p>He would never be liked by a girl in his entire life!</p><p>“But when the time comes, for the sake of the ranking, he will still fight his way up one step at a time. You might be his first target.” Dao Xuanji looked calmly at Beibei, who was the Ruler of the white-clothed people, but was still a little childish, as she stood in the Saint Hall. She paused for a moment before she said.</p><p>“Are you afraid of him?”</p><p>“Why would I be afraid of him?”</p><p>Beibei jumped up from her chair and the sword case beside her trembled slightly.</p><p>She suddenly became listless again and as her eyes focused on the ground, she said with a little frustration.</p><p>“Actually, yes, a little… But the main thing is that I don’t want him to steal my sword!”</p><p>Dao Xuanji didn’t comment and waved at the door.</p><p>“What if we include these two?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
