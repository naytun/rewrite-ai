She wanted to turn around and leave, but she felt that she had already eaten half of it and had endured the taste for a long time. She was quite unwilling to leave.</p><p>However, that pile of dog poop still hovered in front of her mouth, and she was in a dilemma. It simply drove her crazy!</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Beibei really wanted to scream and vent her frustration in front of everyone.</p><p>No!</p><p>She was the Ruler of the white-clothed people, so she had to give it a go.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou really managed to break down her defenses with just a few words and this was made known, even her predecessor, Moonless Sword Deity, would lose all his dignity!</p><p>Beibei looked at Mei Siren with a blank expression. Like a puppet, she cupped her fists and bowed stiffly.</p><p>“Beibei greets Master Siren…”</p><p>Mei Siren’s face showed signs of empathy.</p><p>From Xu Xiaoshou’s perspective, when he saw how he blocked her words, he could just imagine how uncomfortable Beibei must feel.</p><p>Putting aside their standpoint, Mei Siren also valued every junior ancient swordsman.</p><p>Moreover, since he was a person who had great empathy, he understood how distressed Beibei must be.</p><p>“Tone it down!”</p><p>Mei Siren glared at Xu Xiaoshou harshly. Then, he looked back at the little girl and said gently, “We are on different sides. There is no need to be so polite. You can talk about your own business.”</p><p>Beibei finally turned around and looked at Xu Xiaoshou. “Are you satisfied?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the dazed little girl and suddenly his interest was piqued. He raised his voice and said.</p><p>“Oh? Did you perform the sword ritual to appease me?”</p><p>“What did that have to do with me? Didn’t you want to pay your respects to Master Siren?”</p><p>“I!” Beibei’s heart was in a knot. At that moment, her eyes were filled with a murderous intent. She gritted her teeth and said, “Of course!”</p><p>“What?” Xu Xiaoshou cupped his face and said in surprise.</p><p>“You really wanted to pay your respects to my Master Siren, from the bottom of your heart? The old man had already said that we are enemies!”</p><p>“Beibei, you’re the Ruler of the white-clothed people in the Holy Divine Palace. In broad daylight, you even dared to collude with the Teacher of the leader of the dark faction. You deserve to be punished!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked around.</p><p>He mainly glanced at the Saints from the Holy Divine Palace, and then pointed rudely at Beibei.</p><p>“If I were Dao Xuanji, she would have to break at least two arms, more than two arms!”</p><p>There was silence everywhere.</p><p>Killing people was just a mere nod of the head.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou never just killed people, he also wanted to kill people’s hearts.</p><p>His last sentence was filled with veiled insinuations; it hinted at the number of people from the Holy Divine Palace who were involved!</p><p>Elder Zhong and Fang Wenxin’s faces turned ashen.</p><p>The people in Jade Capital City looked at Beibei, who trembled violently and was on the verge of collapse and felt a chill in their hearts. They whispered.</p><p>“Lord Shou’s mouth…”</p><p>“If I were Beibei, I would die without a fight.”</p><p>“No? Brothers, why don’t I understand? Why did the Northern Sword Deity suddenly stop talking? What is Lord Shou talking about?”</p><p>“Ah, don’t you understand… With your intelligence, you can’t even catch up to his powerful words!”</p><p>Li Fugui was among the crowd, and he almost wanted to applaud loudly for Lord Shou. He turned his head and tried to explain to the people around him,</p><p>“Listen up! What Lord Shou meant when he talked about ‘broken arms’ is…”</p><p>“The Judicial Division’s punishments were too excessive, Hallmaster Dao stood on the sidelines and the Council of Ten did nothing. Hallmaster Xuanji was tyrannical and unreasonable, and she loved to talk nonsense. In addition, the Moonless Sword Deity had contributed and worked hard, but in the end, he was framed!”</p><p>“All of you should put more thoughts into this…”</p><p>“Back then, the Moonless Sword Deity took down the second-in-command of the Saint Servant, Sleeveless and he lost an arm. Rao Yaoyao died for the Holy Divine Palace and even after her death was condemned during Hallmaster Xuanji’s inauguration ceremony. Let’s not talk about the Chief of the six divisions. Let’s just look at Hallmaster Dao…”</p><p>“Didn’t Hallmaster Dao, who worked so diligently for more than thirty years, end up with both his arms broken? The Sacred Mountain’s foundation was taken away, the position of the Hallmaster was snatched away-they were all stabbed in the back!”</p><p>“So what did Lord Shou mean?”</p><p>“What Lord Shou meant was that the lesson of the past is the teacher of the future. Can’t you see that the three Saints of the Holy Divine Palace were afraid to fight to the death. Only you the Northern Sword Deity are powerful and have a strong cultivation? Deep realm? Your brain is filled with spiritual light, do you dare to draw your sword against our Lord Shou?”</p><p>“Bullsh*t!”</p><p>“Even if she, the Northern Sword Deity managed to take down Lord Shou in the end, what will await her? Would it be a reward? A promotion?”</p><p>Li Fugui’s face turned red as he spoke, and his spittle flew everywhere. He swung his sleeves and said passionately.</p><p>“No, that would be two broken arms!”</p><p>“She could not even take down Demi-Saint Ye and Master Siren. She only took Lord Shou who is at the Sovereign Dao Realm. It would be easy for her to break both arms. Beibei might even lose her head!”</p><p>This profound insight shocked everyone around and made their scalps tingle.</p><p>“Brother, what’s your name? You… are too strong! Your understanding of this matter is remarkable! I admit defeat.”</p><p>“Wow, if I had your brains and understanding, I wouldn’t have to worry about the Master Stage not being able to comprehend the Dao and break through the Yin Yang Stat?”</p><p>The group of people gathered together and almost wanted to deify this person. Li Fugui smiled and stroked his fake beard.</p><p>“My surname is Zhu.”</p><p>He then said meaningfully,</p><p>“The Dao can be broken, but human feelings are difficult to break. The body can die, but the name can’t die… Let’s see what the Northern Sword Deity Bei’s choice would be.”</p><p>“Lord Shou has a very good saying. The elders here have all learned it, but the Norther Sword Deity Bei is still too young and has yet to comprehend it.”</p><p>“What saying?” Everyone’s curiosity was piqued.</p><p>Li Fugui chuckled and looked at the void. He revealed the temperament of a charlatan. He sighed. “It’s rare to be muddle-headed.”</p><p>Was it rare to be muddle-headed?</p><p>This time, everyone frowned and lowered their heads. They mulled over it as if they had understood something. “Brother, you have a brilliant idea. Your words… Amazing!”</p><p>“I’m not the one who’s amazing. It’s Lord Shou who’s amazing.”</p><p>Li Fugui chuckled and said, “There are swordsmen in the Eastern Region who studied Bazhun’an’s ‘one sword and one song’. I’m not one of them. I’ve been a ‘Shou’ scholar for a year and a half; I specialize in the study of Lord Shou’s words. It’s normal that you can’t keep up with my progress.”</p><p>At this moment, a holy voice exploded from the Nine Heavens. It came from Fang Wenxin, and its murderous aura was truly awe-inspiring.</p><p>“Who’s spouting nonsense down there?!”</p><p>With a smack, everyone’s faces were bombarded by their shoes. Li Fugui had long disappeared.</p><p>Not to mention.</p><p>It was just a joke.</p><p>When the whispers in the Jade Capital City faded away, Beibei was affected.</p><p>That so-called scholar’s understanding was indeed exaggerated, but it was undoubtedly unique and hit the nail on the head!</p><p>Beibei touched the invitation letter in her hand and hesitated…</p><p>Let’s not talk about it for the time being.</p><p>If she lost, Xu Xiaoshou’s words sounded like child’s play. Could she really protect her self?</p><p>Behind him, Lei Xi’er silently watched the scene before her.</p><p>During Mu Zixi’s time, she had seen Xu Xiaoshou kill people intangibly with his Lip Spear, Tongue Sword technique countless times, so her emotions were no longer affected.</p><p>But when even the Ruler of the white-clothed people was stunned by this shout, she felt dazed.</p><p>Beibei was indeed not famous. Only when the new Seven Sword Deity rankings were released were some of her achievements made known…</p><p>But there was no doubt that she was strong.</p><p>The Seven Sword Deity wouldn’t act rashly, and no matter how stupid the Holy Divine Palace was, they wouldn’t randomly assign a rank to someone.</p><p>Just look at the previous Ruler of the white-clothed people. Beibei was on par with him. At the very least, she had Gou Wuyue’s combat strength when she first took over.</p><p>However, when she faced Xu Xiaoshou, she really seemed like a child!</p><p>On the other hand, Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>After this fellow finished speaking, boundless ghostly energy appeared under his feet.</p><p>He once again sat arrogantly on the ghostly energy throne. He looked the people around him, especially Lei Shuangxing, and smiled.</p><p>“I’m invincible among my peers!”</p><p>“I’ll give you another chance, and also a piece of advice.”</p><p>“If you retreat now, you can still maintain your position as the Ruler of the white-clothed people and preserve the reputation of the Seven Sword Deity. Think twice!”</p><p>Lei Shuangxing tightened his grip on the sword in his hand and wanted to test his strength.</p><p>However, he could still read the situation.</p><p>Later, he could challenge Xu Xiaoshou. In front of Jade Capital City and the Holy Divine Palace, the Saint Servant was like his family.</p><p>Beibei fell silent.</p><p>She looked back and saw Gu Yu and Li Fuyu behind her as they stared at her from afar.</p><p>No one spoke, no one mocked.</p><p>But perhaps, no one would think that she could win, right?</p><p>Jade Capital City broke out in an uproar. Under everyone’s gaze, Beibei smiled and threw the invitation letter to the front. She held her sword and bowed formally.</p><p>“I, Seven Sword Deity Beibei, officially challenge Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>“This battle will be known to the world and the five regions. The Southern Region’s Feng family will supervise this battle. We sincerely invite the ancient swordsmen from the continent to the Central Region to watch the battle.”</p><p>“The venue is Jade Capital City. The time is set for three days later.”</p><p>Beibei paused for a moment, and a provocative look appeared in her eyes. She glanced at the young man in black and said.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, do you dare to accept the challenge?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
