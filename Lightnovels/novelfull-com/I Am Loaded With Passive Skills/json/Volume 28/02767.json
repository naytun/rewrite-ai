The Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou, the new Seven Sword Deity, had blocked the entrance to Jade Capital City for two days already.”</p><p>“My clan is in the city. I heard some news that Hallmaster Xuanji was killed twice in just two days!”</p><p>“What was that? Twice?”</p><p>This bit of news attracted the attention of quite a number of people.</p><p>After all, everyone was ‘trapped’ in the Sacred Mountain and couldn’t go down.</p><p>Although Jade Capital City was not far from the foot of the mountain, the people who guarded the mountain could not leave the Sacred Mountain due to their duties. They could only drink in the rumors from afar to quench their thirst.</p><p>“Yes! At least two of Hallmaster Xuanji’s demi-saint incarnations have perished!”</p><p>“That’s rather incredible! When Xu Xiaoshou beheaded Sword Saint Rao, everyone thought that it was a joke and something that was impossible to achieve…”</p><p>Some people sighed, and some people also reflected on it.</p><p>“That shouldn’t be the case. When Hallmaster Dao was in power, he worked hard for decades and had never suffered such a huge failure. How long had Hallmaster Xuanji been in power?”</p><p>“Just two days!”</p><p>“If one of her incarnations died each day, then tomorrow… Oh, no, there’s going to be another transition ceremony the day after tomorrow?” Someone teased.</p><p>“Shh! You brat, that is so disrespectful!”</p><p>“Haha, compared to my disrespectful words, Hallmaster Xuanji had become something of a joke. I heard Xu Xiaoshou even brought up the Lei family’s tragedy in public?”</p><p>This immediately caused another wave of discussion.</p><p>However, it was too far away. Even among the guardians of the mountain, some of their clansmen were still in Jade Capital City, and they only dared to spread the news that could be spread.</p><p>As for the Lei family’s matter, they would definitely be suppressed later.</p><p>At this time, if they were to stir up trouble and publicize it wantonly, wouldn’t they be caught and killed after the matter was settled as a warning to others?</p><p>“I don’t know the specifics about the Lei family, but Hallmaster Xuanji’s crushing defeat could be said to be a portent.”</p><p>“Oh? What do you think, brother?”</p><p>“Think about it. On the first day of Hallmaster Xuanji’s appointment, so many people died on the Sacred Mountain. The entire Path Division was wiped out. That was already an ominous sign.”</p><p>“After that, there were ghost beasts that wreaked havoc in Jade Capital City. Xu Xiaoshou threatened to massacre the city. Under such circumstances, she still declared war and wanted to lead her troops to the Southern Region. That was too unwise.”</p><p>“Not only that, it’s fine if she did not care about the external threats. Before she had completely eradicated the internal threats, she already abolished the rules that were set by Hallmaster Dao previously set in the Saint Hall.”</p><p>“What rules?” Everyone jostled each other to get closer.</p><p>“Ha, you guys know who Jiang Nayi is, right?”</p><p>“Yes, yes.”</p><p>“The Jiang Clan of Pu Xuan from the North Region had managed to produce someone like Jiang Buyi. Even though he suffered the Saint Fall in Sky City, at least he still maintained the pride of a demi-saint and would not admit defeat even if he died.”</p><p>“This Jiang Nayi? He is vulgar and good at flattery. He followed Hallmaster Xuanji the moment she arrived and even barged into the Saint Hall. I heard that he was even disrespectful toward Lord Xi!”</p><p>“In my opinion, the reason why Hallmaster Xuanji failed so miserably was because she kept this male escort…”</p><p>Before his teasing remark was over, a thunderous roar suddenly erupted from the peak of the Sacred Mountain.</p><p>“Xu! Xiao! Shou!”</p><p>The killing intent in this voice was so evident. It scared everyone who fled and hid and did not dare to make any more comments.</p><p>Dao Xuanji!</p><p>Hallmaster Xuanji had risen!</p><p>“Whoosh.”</p><p>It was like being hit by the Flower Fairy Eyes technique.</p><p>In the dark secret chamber, Dao Xuanji once again emerged naked from the spring. She felt a familiar pain in her head.</p><p>She clutched her head in agony.</p><p>This was the second time!</p><p>She had experienced this kind of fantasy realm pain twice in two short days!</p><p>A demi-saint had been killed twice by a young man. Even if she, Dao Xuanji, wasn’t the Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace, she would the laughing stock in the demi-saint circle.</p><p>Moreover, she was!</p><p>This was such an embarrassment and even the Holy Emperor aristocratic family were aware of this.</p><p>Not only would Dao Xuanji be too ashamed to face the others in the future, but the image of the Holy Divine Palace would also suffer a disastrous decline.</p><p>In the future, whenever the name of the Holy Divine Palace was mentioned, everyone would think of the First Pavilion in the Sky and the image of Xu Xiaoshou on the Sacred Mountain!</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The dark room exploded and the light disappeared.</p><p>Even if she didn’t want to face anyone, Dao Xuanji still had to come out of seclusion.</p><p>Even if she could hear endless criticism through the activated great array on the mountain…</p><p>When she arrived at the Saint Hall, Dao Xuanji’s anger was already at its boiling peak. She would kill anyone who dared to talk about this on the Sacred Mountain.</p><p>But if that was really the case, then not only would the Path Division perish, the entire Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe would be emptied.</p><p>“Where is Jiang Nayi?”</p><p>“Jiang Nayi, get over here now!”</p><p>Dao Xuanji shook her head and the moisture on her wet hair dissipated instantly. She sat on the Hallmaster seat and slammed the table hard as she shouted.</p><p>Outside the Saint Hall, a boy suddenly walked in.</p><p>This was the person who usually attended to Ai Cangsheng and pushed his wheelchair.</p><p>The rest of the boys who waited outside didn’t dare to enter the tiger’s lair at this moment.</p><p>The boy bowed and said respectfully.</p><p>“Hallmaster Xuanji, Lord Jiang Nayi entered the god slayer ruins and had yet to return.”</p><p>Ruins?</p><p>Dao Xuanji was stunned for a moment before she recalled that she had sent Jiang Nayi to summon Ai Cangsheng.</p><p>“It’s already been more than a day, why is he not back yet?”</p><p>“It’s only Ai Cangsheng, did he require such a lengthy invitation?”</p><p>“Could it be that Jiang Nayi was lazy and refused to advance, or could it be that Ai Cangsheng refused to come back and help? Tell me!”</p><p>The boy trembled.</p><p>How would I know about this?</p><p>Hallmaster Xuanji must have gone crazy. How could she say these words to a boy?</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>When she saw how the boy fell to his knees and begged for mercy as he kowtowed repeatedly, Dao Xuanji calmed down.</p><p>Her expression became indifferent and she flicked her sleeves and said.</p><p>“Tell the Jiang Clan of Pu Xuan from the Northern Region to enter the god slayer ruins together with those who are able to. We must find Jiang Nayi.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
