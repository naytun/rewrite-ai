Lei Shuangxing was a Saint Servant, he was lying! Miss Zhiwen could never be like this. She’s my…”</p><p>“How is it impossible? It was a fact that Hallmaster Xuanji had destroyed the Lei family. Although the process had not been passed down, the results were traceable…Oh, now I understand why there’s no record of the process of annihilating the Lei family!”</p><p>“My God, if what Lei Shuangxing said is true, then Hallmaster Xuanji is simply evil…Uh.”</p><p>“I don’t believe it! I still don’t believe it! Miss Zhiwen is so gentle and kind. How could she…”</p><p>“Stop sucking up to her, brother. How could she not know whether those eyes were hers? Gentle and kind? All of this can be faked!”</p><p>“Impossible, shut up!”</p><p>“Wake up, brother. It’s time for the dream to end!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The entire Jade Capital City had never experienced such a huge upheaval even after Xu Xiaoshou’s Explosive Bounded Domain.</p><p>The discussions around them gradually grew louder and more ear-piercing, each sounded like a knife or sword, ruthlessly cutting into people’s hearts.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s mind went blank.</p><p>She did not even know who was standing in front of her at this moment, nor did she know what he was saying.</p><p>She felt as if she was isolated by the world. Her body became so cold, and her starry eyes emitted waves of pain. The colors around her gradually lost color…</p><p>“I’m not!”</p><p>“I didn’t!”</p><p>“Pearl Gem Star Eyes, is-isn’t it…It’s not like that!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen panted heavily as tears flowed out of her eyes, blurring her vision and blurring the world.</p><p>She felt her chest tighten and her breath short, like a drowning fish. Her worldview was collapsing.</p><p>“Master…”</p><p>She looked at her Supreme Master.</p><p>Her master’s body was surrounded by devilish energy, and it suddenly turned into a bloody nightmare ghost, pouncing over from the sky.</p><p>“Xu…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen dodged with difficulty, like a drowning person grabbing onto a life-saving straw, and turned to look at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>However, at this moment, she saw that person’s eyes were filled with shock and his face was filled with horror.</p><p>The gaze he looked at her with was only suspicion and disbelief. In the end, it turned into indifference, hostility, and hatred…</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen hugged her head and shouted.</p><p>A red light flashed in the Pearl Gem Star Eyes, and the sound of a mirror cracking could be heard.</p><p>Devilish energy seeped out of her seven orifices, and then her entire body was stained with a faint evil intent.</p><p>…</p><p>“Wake up!”</p><p>“Little Yu, wake up”</p><p>“Yu Zhiwen, wake up!”</p><p>Elder Yu had appeared beside Yu Zhiwen at some point in time. He grabbed his great-granddaughter’s stiff shoulders and shook them.</p><p>However, after Lei Shuangxing’s words, Yu Zhiwen was petrified and didn’t move.</p><p>No matter how hard he shook, she did not wake up.</p><p>“Ka-”</p><p>The Taoist music collapsed.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s body was covered in devilish energy.</p><p>At this moment, Elder Yu felt a chill run down his spine. His foundational roots had collapsed?</p><p>“Yu Zhiwen!”</p><p>He shouted, but Yu Zhiwen felt as if her soul had been pulled away, and she could no longer wake up.</p><p>At this time, the criticism in Jade Capital City became more and more intense.</p><p>“The Lei Family’s Eyes were seized by Hallmaster Xuanji…”</p><p>“No, it’s possible that Yu Zhiwen specifically asked for the Pearl Gem Star Eyes, so Dao Xuanji went to get them for her. It’s not hard to tell with the intimate attitude between the master and her disciple.”</p><p>“Damn! What you say makes sense, but isn’t it a little too much to destroy the entire Lei family for a pair of Pearl Gem Star Eyes?”</p><p>“A little too much? If you don’t uproot the weeds, they will grow again with the spring breeze…”</p><p>The rumors in the city turned into an invisible storm that could even overturn the snow on the city and the heart of the Great Path.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou let out a deep sigh and could no longer sit idly by.</p><p>He came to Elder Yu’s side and put his hand on his shoulder. “Get up.”</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Elder Yu’s eyes were red as he turned around and roared.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. His eyes turned red as he shouted,</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>He struck out with his palm.</p><p>The power of the ancestral source and the Space Dao Disc directly blasted this troublesome old man a thousand miles away.</p><p>Then, he bent down and let his energy sink into his energy center, before shouting angrily,</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>The sound waves swept up the snow, swallowing the mountains and rivers.</p><p>With this shout, the sound wave crossed the Xuanji great array and swept through the Jade Capital City.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>After a series of painful cries.</p><p>“Thud thud thud…”</p><p>In an instant, 90% of the people in the entire Jade Capital City had fallen.</p><p>The rest of them hugged their throbbing heads and squatted on the ground, trembling. They did not dare to make another sound.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>Elder Yu had returned and had yet to make a move.</p><p>Seeing Xu Xiaoshou touch the spot between Little Yu’s eyebrows, the devilish energy that had just escaped was swallowed by the thread.</p><p>Elder Yu rubbed his chest and took two deep breaths. His anger was suppressed and his nervous emotions were somewhat relieved. He rubbed his hands and muttered,</p><p>“Very good, very good…”</p><p>Outside the Jade Capital City, in the southern area where no one cared about, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was slightly dazed.</p><p>With the help of the Body of Devour, Yu Zhiwen’s condition improved a little, and her eyes gradually regained consciousness.</p><p>Dao Xuanji, who was surrounded by devilish energy, trembled slightly. Her eyes returned to emptiness from the complicated emotions.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing did not stop Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He knew that Yu Zhiwen should wake up. There were still too many things that needed to be confronted and too many things that needed to be cleared.</p><p>Being unconscious didn’t give her a chance to escape from anything…</p><p>Behind them.</p><p>Lei Xi’er, who remained silent, slightly tilted her God Devil Eyes.</p><p>From Xu Xiaoshou’s focused expression and firm hand, her sight was extended to Yu Zhiwen’s soft and weak face.</p><p>“Heh.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
