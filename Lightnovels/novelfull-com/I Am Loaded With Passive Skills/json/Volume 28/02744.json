It looked over with an incomparably terrifying gaze.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>…</p><p>The rumbling thunder came layer by layer, causing people to lose their minds.</p><p>The Heavenly Ancestor Image?</p><p>Cold sweat broke out on Elder Yu’s back. With this glance and shout, the momentum of his Kun body was halted.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had received the Heavenly Ancestor’s Legacy and obtained the Ten Ancestors Image.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>He had never used it before…</p><p>“Oh, that’s right, there was no need for it before… No! How much had this young man hidden?”</p><p>The Heavenly Ancestor’s will blocked the way.</p><p>Not to mention that Elder Yu already wanted to retreat.</p><p>Even if he wanted to charge forward, his Kun body was powerless to do so.</p><p>The Heavenly Ancestor’s eyeball that had split the sky…</p><p>With just one look, Elder Yu felt that if he took half a step forward, a shocking change would happen.</p><p>If he didn’t die, he would be severely injured!</p><p>“Sob…”</p><p>From Dao Xuanji’s perspective, nothing was visible.</p><p>The Kun Beast came from the horizon, and after pausing for a moment, it returned to the horizon to slack off.</p><p>“Yu Kunpeng!”</p><p>Dao Xuanji was furious. He thought, “Either you don’t come, or if you do, you block desperately. This advance and retreat, are you playing with me?”</p><p>However, it still bought some time.</p><p>When the Fourth Sword came at her face, she wanted to block them.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>In the distance, Beibei cried out in surprise.</p><p>A sword materialized, and she arrived before the vicious sword of the Five Great Divine Instruments of Chaos.</p><p>Only then did Dao Xuanji realize that she had been distracted by the power of guidance again.</p><p>There was a Fourth Sword in the vicious sword. If one wasn’t an ancient swordsman and thought they could block it with their physical body… they would die without even knowing how!</p><p>“A mere Beibei can be broken with a snap of a finger.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t have the arrogance of an ancient swordsman. After his expression changed, he locked his Three Loathsome Eyes onto her.</p><p>Beibei slapped her sword case, wanting to pull out the Supreme Emperor Sword…</p><p>The movements were cool, but the fancy front swing took too long.</p><p>Under the guidance of the aura, she looked over and saw Xu Xiaoshou’s strange left eye…</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>Beibei’s body went limp, and she fell to the ground.</p><p>…</p><p>Dao Xuanji controlled the Xuanji great array and directly flashed into the array.</p><p>However, the fleeting teleportation gate, she wondered how Xu Xiaoshou, the sovereign of the Weaving Technique, could miss it.</p><p>The Fourth Sword slipped through the door crack, following into the Xuanji great array!</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>The people of Jade Capital City were thrown into chaos.</p><p>They were seized by Ye Xiaotian.</p><p>Outside, Dao Xuanji was colossal, like a giant.</p><p>The Fourth Sword was also massive, slicing through the explosive waves, its sword energy boundless.</p><p>But suddenly, Dao Xuanji shrank as she entered, and the Fourth Sword shrank and followed.</p><p>There was no escape!</p><p>Did Xu Xiaoshou truly intend to kill Dao Xuanji every time he saw her?</p><p>He was utterly unreasonable!</p><p>“Elder Gu!”</p><p>Dao Xuanji let out a heart-wrenching scream.</p><p>Never in her life had she been in such a pitiful state!</p><p>In front of everyone, she was about to be chased by Xu Xiaoshou’s sword into Ye Xiaotian’s protection!</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s Dao Heart was on the verge of collapsing.</p><p>At that critical moment, Gu Yu, the current “Number One Sword Deity” of the five regions, sighed and stepped forward.</p><p>“A mere Sword Deity, do you dare to face me?”</p><p>Before he even moved, Xu Xiaoshou’s words reached him, and Gu Yu glanced over.</p><p>Amidst the dazzling light, the figure seated on the ghostly energy throne changed.</p><p>He transformed into a figure clad in black, standing on the rooftop of a lonely building beneath the full moon, with only a blurred silhouette of his back remaining.</p><p>“This!”</p><p>Gu Yu’s heart trembled.</p><p>He didn’t know that Xu Xiaoshou’s Heart Sword Technique imagery was that of the Sword God Gu Louying!</p><p>He didn’t have time to prepare for it.</p><p>At that moment, the black figure stood on the rooftop of the lone building, sword tilted, glancing sideways.</p><p>“In my eyes, all beings are devils.”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Gu Yu barely pulled himself away from the imagery of the Sword God Gu Louying, but endless devilish energy began to rise from his body.</p><p>He could barely manage himself, let alone rescue Dao Xuanji.</p><p>…</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>The black sword whistled through the air, right behind his head!</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s eyes widened in shock. She hastily formed a seal and turned to block.</p><p>“Divine Thirty-Six Forms, Grand…”</p><p>“Grand what? Dao Xuanji, your heart is in chaos!”</p><p>A faint chuckle suddenly echoed in her ears, “This is the Fantasy Sword Technique, didn’t you notice?”</p><p>As the voice fell, the scenes of the world turned into fluttering Hong Mei petals.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou still sat calmly on the ghostly energy throne high in the sky.</p><p>But Ye Xiaotian had not taken control of Jade Capital City. Instead, Xu Xiaoshou, his second true body, stood beside him, holding his hand, stopping everything.</p><p>Everything that happened in Jade Capital City was real.</p><p>The only illusion was that the one holding the city was Xu Xiaoshou’s second true body. He also possessed space attributes and had a photographic memory, with the help of the Imitator, he could temporarily mimic Ye Xiaotian’s spiritual technique.</p><p>What Dao Xuanji entered wasn’t Ye Xiaotian’s World in the Palm, but Xu Xiaoshou’s second true body’s World in the Palm!</p><p>From start to finish, she was within Xu Xiaoshou’s control!</p><p>With a hiss, the word “Grand” was uttered, and the world froze.</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s pupils dilated as she watched the Fourth Sword pierce through her glabella and fly out from the back of her head.</p><p>In the distant world beyond, the ghostly beast figure sitting on the ghostly energy throne was enormous. It shook its head with a mocking smile.</p><p>“Remember, Dao Xuanji…”</p><p>“I’ll kill you every time I see you!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
