He had transformed into a ghost beast and had the Body of Devour!</p><p>This habitual way of thinking was truly dangerous.</p><p>However, all the energy, spiritual energy, and holy power that had vanished with this roar were condensed into a blurry sphere in Xu Xiaoshou’s palm as the three Saints loomed before him.</p><p>It was a blurry sphere.</p><p>If it were enlarged, he wondered if it would resemble a… bounded domain.</p><p>But the energy within was anything but blurry. Infernal, Frozen Calamity, sword cognition, Elemental power, Power of Demons and Beasts, power of the ancestral source… anything you could imagine was present!</p><p>For the first time, this Explosive Bounded Domain had gathered all these energies, pushing the instantaneous explosion to the extreme of what Xu Xiaoshou could achieve.</p><p>When he launched this attack, there wasn’t even a hint of protection. It was merely a gentle swipe in front of the Blood Shadow copper coin and the three Saints.</p><p>Everyone realized something was wrong…</p><p>Yet in this world, the only word that remained, transmitted through Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts, was, “Explode.”</p><p>…</p><p>Rumble…</p><p>A slight earthquake shook the Central Yuan world.</p><p>Everyone looked around in confusion, exchanging glances, sensing an ominous familiarity, like the prelude to a catastrophe.</p><p>After all, the last time a similar earthquake struck, an Ultimate Giant appeared in the Central Yuan world and tore apart the Holy Emperor Qilin!</p><p>“Look, over there!”</p><p>“Is that… the direction of the Qilin Realm?”</p><p>“No! It seems even further, maybe the Jade Capital City?”</p><p>“It looks like something’s happening in Jade Capital City. Has Elder Yan been resurrected?”</p><p>In the direction of the distant Jade Capital City, it looked as though a massive sun had fallen, covering half the sky.</p><p>From the vantage point of the Central Yuan World, under that terrifyingly bright white light, mountains lost their color, and the world dimmed as if the apocalypse had arrived.</p><p>Luckily, it wasn’t happening in the Central Yuan world.</p><p>“It can’t be Lord Shou, right?”</p><p>“Not. Lord Shou must be weakened after that battle with the Holy Emperor.”</p><p>“But I heard that there’s indeed chaos in Jade Capital City. It seems like the Hallmaster Dao is trying to capture the Ten High Nobles’ Xiang Yaoyao. Could it be Aunt Xiang stirring up trouble?”</p><p>“Pfft! Bro, stop joking. Aunt Xiang? Hahaha!”</p><p>…</p><p>Above Jade Capital City.</p><p>“No way…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was dumbfounded.</p><p>For the first time, he witnessed Xu Xiaoshou, who had transformed into a ghost beast, make a move, and it almost made him lose his confidence.</p><p>His role here wasn’t to help Xu Xiaoshou fend off the lower demi-saint. Instead, it was to put out fires.</p><p>Besides protecting Jade Capital City, it seemed all he could do was protect Jade Capital City.</p><p>As for the rest, even if the three Saints were to face him, he wondered if Xu Xiaoshou could send them flying by himself.</p><p>When the terrifying explosion shook…</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi slowly turned into ashes and disappeared.</p><p>Fang Wenxin vomited blood from the Blood Shadow copper coin. The spirits of the ghost beasts protected themselves and disappeared one after another.</p><p>In the end, Elder Yu, who was only left with half of his body, pulled him away and barely escaped from the center of the explosion!</p><p>Mei Siren couldn’t take care of himself and could only flee in a sorry state.</p><p>He was the only one who could protect the Jade Capital City.</p><p>“How could he…”</p><p>“He’s only at the Sovereign Dao Realm. How can he be so powerful…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian shook his head incredulously as he moved to isolate the battlefield with tears in his eyes, taking Jade Capital City into his hands.</p><p>When he was done, he looked back at the center of the explosion. His eyes turned red when he saw Xu Xiaoshou, who was still standing at the peak of the ghostly energy.</p><p>“This is… ghost beast form?”</p><p>At this moment, a hand was placed on his arm.</p><p>…</p><p>The bounded domain that had gone out of control was completely beyond Xu Xiaoshou’s control.</p><p>Thanks to this, the control of the Three Loathsome Eyes was broken when Dao Xuanji was about to leave the city!</p><p>Dao Xuanji snapped out of her daze and raised her eyes. The scene of the end of the world followed the soundless explosion and invaded her face.</p><p>“What is this…”</p><p>She didn’t even remember what happened just now, but she knew that her life was in danger again.</p><p>“This Dao is prohibited!”</p><p>At the same time that Dao Xuanji retreated, the Celestial Scroll under her feet started to spin.</p><p>In the nick of time, she successfully activated the Xuanji great array and set up countless restrictive spell chains, stabbing them into the explosive energy.</p><p>However, at this moment, a low laugh sounded in her ears.</p><p>“This Dao is mine!”</p><p>Dao Xuanji turned her head and quickly closed her eyes.</p><p>However, when her saint’s will swept over, Xu Xiaoshou’s mocking expression when he flicked his sword deeply pierced into her heart.</p><p>He didn’t use the Three Loathsome Eyes anymore!</p><p>He seemed to be certain that she would close her eyes and seize the opportunity while she was controlling the Xuanji great array to shoot out the Fourth Sword!</p><p>The black sword pierced through the shadows and quickly charged forward amidst the waves of explosions.</p><p>Dao Xuanji only felt the desire to die.</p><p>She had never thought that Xu Xiaoshou would be able to kill her so forcefully when she appeared again and was fully prepared.</p><p>“Unwilling!”</p><p>“I’m unwilling!”</p><p>“Sob…”</p><p>At this moment, the cry of a Kun rang out, and her savior appeared.</p><p>Elder Yu was truly afraid. He did not dare to let Dao Xuanji be killed twice by Xu Xiaoshou in front of him.</p><p>This was not just a sin of dereliction of duty.</p><p>The Holy Divine Palace had some dignity!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, get lost!”</p><p>Facing the impact of the explosion, the enormous Kun body was still able to quickly crash over like a wave.</p><p>This attack not only contained the hatred of Elder Yu being sent flying and his great-granddaughter Little Yu being blinded, but it also contained the intention of teaching him a lesson.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
