I agree with this fight. No need to head to the Southern Region, that saves a lot on travel expenses. Lord Shou is indeed a practical man!”</p><p>“Go, Northern Sword Deity! I’ll always support you!”</p><p>“Fight! Fight!”</p><p>The people of the Central Region weren’t as particular as the Feng family from the Eastern and Southern Regions.</p><p>To watch a match for free, right in front of them and happening now… Compared to the Saint War, where the mere aftershocks of a fight could determine one’s life or death, a battle between Sword Deity was much, much more entertaining.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou’s remarks sounded completely inappropriate and against the rules to Mei Siren, Gu Yu, and the others.</p><p>Mei Siren quietly pulled out a jade scroll from behind his paper fan and placed it against his forehead, recording something unknown.</p><p>Then, like releasing a messenger pigeon, he sent the jade scroll flying into the spatial fragment.</p><p>On the other hand, Gu Yu was the first to object. He sternly stated, “What kind of nonsense is this?”</p><p>“There are no rules for a wheel battle, no group brawl, or a one-versus-three situation.”</p><p>“Moreover, without the Feng family of the Southern Region supervising the fight, I refuse to engage with you today. We can reschedule for another day.”</p><p>Not fighting?</p><p>Beibei’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised an eyebrow but remained silent. Instead, he turned his gaze to Li Fuyu.</p><p>He recalled this young woman’s fighting spirit. It had been evident since the moment he entered the city and had persisted until now, yet they hadn’t crossed swords.</p><p>This was likely why the Holy Divine Palace had invited Li Fuyu to here for support.</p><p>As for her combat strength… Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the exceptional sword hanging at her waist and was confused.</p><p>“What about you?” he asked, thinking the sword tower’s Sword Human couldn’t be lacking in skill, could she?</p><p>“Whatever,” Li Fuyu responded indifferently. “According to the rules of this world, it’s best to have the Feng family oversee the fight, but if not… whenever you’re ready, I’m prepared to engage.”</p><p>What an arrogant tone!</p><p>From her calm demeanor, Xu Xiaoshou sensed deep confidence, while the Spiritual Cultivators of Jade Capital City saw unparalleled arrogance!</p><p>With Lord Shou’s impressive achievements already in the past, with half the city bearing witness to his victories, every single person in Jade Capital City had been beaten to submission.</p><p>Yet here was Li Fuyu, whose origins were barely known, and she seemed to imply that it wasn’t she who should challenge Lord Shou, but rather, Lord Shou who should fight her!</p><p>“This woman is too arrogant. I can’t stand it anymore. Lord Shou, quickly teach her a lesson and make her turn over a new leaf.”</p><p>“To be fair, I have to admit Xu Xiaoshou’s combat strength is something I respect. If he could even cut down Hallmaster Xuanji, then as for Li Fuyu… well, good luck to her.”</p><p>“The arrogance must come from some hidden trump card, surely?”</p><p>“But she doesn’t see who she’s facing. That’s Lord Shou! Many have tried to be arrogant in front of Lord Shou, Demi-Saint Jiang, Demi-Saint Rao, even the Hallmaster Xuanji…”</p><p>“Shh!”</p><p>“Well, anyway, let’s just see how she meets her end!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Expected, Passive Points, +8466.”</p><p>“Supported, Passive Points, +2333.”</p><p>Drawing his focus back from the commotion in the Arena, Xu Xiaoshou looked at Beibei, slightly disappointed. “It seems no one is willing to help you. The Holy Divine Palace has lost the people’s favor.”</p><p>Beibei’s face turned dark. She angrily glared at Gu Yu. She even put down her sword and gestured at the round thing, which had the sharp edges of a semi-saint person.</p><p>“We only agreed to the fight, but it must follow procedure,” Gu Yu replied firmly, her principles unwavering.</p><p>“I have already sent people from the Southern Region to the Feng family. The Feng family knows how important this battle is. At the very least, it’ll take half a day, at most a full day, for the supervisors to arrive!” Beibei stomped her foot in frustration.</p><p>“I can’t wait half a day for you.” Xu Xiaoshou chuckled and said, “What’s the matter, some internal conflict?”</p><p>“Shut up!” Beibei snapped back.</p><p>“Just a reminder. Usually, in a situation like this, it means your chips aren’t enough… Double or even triple, quadruple the stakes. After all, with a rich reward, there will surely be brave souls,” Xu Xiaoshou telepathically communicated.”</p><p>“Shut up! Who’s listening to you?”</p><p>After her outburst, Beibei fell into deep thought…</p><p>Double, triple?</p><p>That would mean three semi-saint persons.</p><p>That was too valuable. Even if she sold herself, she wouldn’t gather enough chips!</p><p>Just as the situation was stuck in a stalemate and Beibei was at a loss for ideas…</p><p>Mei Siren, who was outside the Arena, stepped forward with a faint smile and said loudly, “I have a compromise.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickly turned his head, raising his eyebrows and winking. “Master Siren, you’re on my side, don’t go helping them!”</p><p>Everyone in the Arena turned their gaze towards him.</p><p>Beibei’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Oh, she had forgotten about Master Siren.</p><p>He had been famous for a long time, and rumor had it that he had once guided Senior Feng Tingchen.</p><p>While the Feng family might not have anyone available to supervise the fight for now, Master Siren’s qualifications were more than enough, as long as they informed the Southern Region’s Feng family in advance.</p><p>Even though he was associated with Xu Xiaoshou, when it came to fairness and justice, the people of the Holy Divine Palace trusted Mei Siren more than they did Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“Master Siren, I have a presumptuous request…”</p><p>“No need, young lady, I already know what you’re going to ask, but there’s no need,” Mei Siren waved his hand, smiling as he continued,</p><p>“I have already contacted Feng Tingchen and informed him of the situation here. He undoubtedly places great importance on this battle.”</p><p>“I believe that by now, the Feng family is already making preparations.”</p><p>“And as for things like the Dao Imparting Mirror, those preparations were made long ago, ever since the new Seven Sword Deity rankings were released.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
