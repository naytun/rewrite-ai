He has the body of a demi-saint!”</p><p>Fang Wenxin, Elder Yu, and Zhong Yuanzi were all shocked. They did not know why Dao Xuanji was so impulsive.</p><p>However, when it came to intervening in the battlefield to provide support…</p><p>“The Dao of the heart, the Godhood is left to my will, and troubles are sleepiness.”</p><p>“Mo Zhidao cut off the true body, cut off the world into a river.”</p><p>Taicheng Xingtian!</p><p>He arrived first!</p><p>In front of Third Saint, a surging river of swords appeared out of thin air, and red plums surged like waves.</p><p>As soon as Third Saint stepped on it, the red dust invaded their mind, and many troubles bubbled to the surface, causing the Mo Sword’s red plums to slash wildly at the true body.</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi was exhausted. He wanted nothing more than to return to the Sacred Mountain and continue his research on elemental fusion…</p><p>Fang Wenxin looked back at her life and wondered what it would have been like if she had joined the red-clothed people…</p><p>Elder Yu saw a chubby little child toddling over and dropped to his knees in a wailing heap.</p><p>“Ahh!”</p><p>He was so angry that he split the ground, scrambling in search of his precious great-granddaughter as if his actions would conjure her from the depths of the sea.</p><p>One sword had controlled three Saints!</p><p>Just then, an old figure appeared in the distance. He controlled the sword with barely any effort as he stroked his beard; his other hand held a folding fan, which he threw out.</p><p>On it were penned the words resembling snakes and dragons, carefree and unrestrained. Four words appeared in stark contrast:</p><p>“Just so very mediocre.”</p><p>Cao Erzhu was sent flying by the old immortal. He stared wide-eyed in shock, exclaiming, “And I thought I was mistaken, Brother Shou. Have you already achieved Penetrating Divine Senses?”</p><p>“Shut up. Isn’t your dear father’s God Punishment Tribulation able to control people from afar? You still have a long way to go.”</p><p>“What? Are you looking down on me?”</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s furious roar freed Dao Xuanji from her fugue.</p><p>She realized that she had been affected by the power of guidance from an unknown source and sought to retreat.</p><p>“God Firmament Leader Path!”</p><p>With a shout, a sea of lightning descended from the sky, almost drowning half of Jade Capital City.</p><p>A tall and sturdy lightning giant stepped out from the eye of the storm. It was thousands of feet tall, dressed in blue armor and a purple cloak. It stood atop a huge wine barrel that stored energy, holding a shield in its left hand and an axe in its right.</p><p>The shield was so large that it seemed to dwarf the lightning giant that wielded it.</p><p>Not to mention Dao Xuanji, even Xu Xiaoshou was stunned by Cao Erzhu’s display…</p><p>There had to be something wrong with him!</p><p>That wasn’t the strength a Sovereign (Stage) expert should possess.</p><p>Moreover, wasn’t that a sword image? And a Thunder Elephant at that?!</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s eyebrows stood on end. He reached out with his left hand and raised his right hand up high.</p><p>Within this sea of lightning, God Firmament Leader Path smashed down with his shield while accumulating power in his axe. His power bleached the world.</p><p>He did not need to use his axe; his shield cast a shadow over the sky, becoming a blow far more than Dao Xuanji could handle.</p><p>Amidst the thunder and lightning, her black hair once combed into a tight bun, bristled like the spines of a porcupine.</p><p>She lost all sensation. When the lightning shield struck her, her whole body, even her face, turned the color of charcoal.</p><p>“Zi zi…”</p><p>A current continued, crackling as it swept through Dao Xuanji’s body, causing her to tremble violently.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou undid his Vanishing Technique. Seeing Hallmaster Xuanji in such a sorry state had left him scared and stiff.</p><p>As he cursed Cao Erzhu for not distinguishing between friend and foe, he grabbed Dao Xuanji’s stiff and trembling forearm and used his sleeveless scarlet-scorched hand to grab it, pulling it forcefully.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A sonic boom ensued.</p><p>The force of his pull sent violent ripples through the air.</p><p>Dao Xuanji convulsed, but her body stayed strong and wholly intact.</p><p>“Ridiculous!”</p><p>Shocked, Xu Xiaoshou chose to activate the power of the Dragon Pearl in his chest.</p><p>Unlike the second true body, the main body had too much energy that the former could not replicate.</p><p>Little by little, piece by piece, the energy slowly wore down the second true body.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>A dragon’s roar resounded.</p><p>Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand, a scarlet-gold scale armor, formed.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes widened in anger, promising pure, unadulterated violence.</p><p>“Dao! Xuan! Ji!”</p><p>Golden light exploded. As Xu Xiaoshou shouted, he kicked Dao Xuanji’s chest and grabbed her right arm with both hands, pulling it in opposite directions.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The sky darkened.</p><p>First, Berserk Giant appeared, and then Ultimate Giant shrouded the sun.</p><p>Between these two forces, a kick and a pull, Dao Xuanji’s shoulder emitted cracking sounds as if it could not bear the strain.</p><p>In the end, with a bang, a sparkling jade-gold liquid sprayed out.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had broken Dao Xuanji’s arm, and her body was sent flying by Ultimate Giant’s kick, slamming into the Xuanji great array.</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>She spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Who dared show such disrespect to her in the past thirty years?</p><p>For a moment, Dao Xuanji felt like she had been beaten silly. Under this pure baptism of violence, it was as if she could relive all the suffering Dao Qiongcang had experienced while he still held her position.</p><p>Her position was one fraught with troubles!</p><p>Once activated, no external force could penetrate the Xuanji great array.</p><p>Thus, Dao Xuanji crashed into the array, her waist forming an arc as the force diffused against the barrier.</p><p>Judging from the direction they were heading, it had to be where Xu Xiaoshou had cut down Hidden Bitter and found Fourth Sword.</p><p>The distance closed in in the blink of an eye.</p><p>In that brief span, Dao Xuanji recovered from the paralysis inflicted by the God Punishment Tribulation. She could see Xu Xiaoshou’s ferocious face and the murderous sword coming at her.</p><p>Even as Xu Xiaoshou continued his assault, he could not help but pepper her with his Lip Spear, Tongue Sword.</p><p>“Remember, Old Lady — and I’m talking to you very seriously — You can’t even compare to a strand of hair on Elder Dao the Flamboyant’s head.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
