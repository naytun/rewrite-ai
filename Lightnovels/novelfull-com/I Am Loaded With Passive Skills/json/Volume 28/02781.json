And there’s also Master Siren, Senior Feng Tingchen, Elder Gu, Yang Xizhi… Sword Deity Li Fuyu is here too. Good heavens, is this a mix of all the Sword Deities?”</p><p>“Gu Qinger and Gu Qingsan are here. Eh, where’s Gu Qingyi? Second Brother Gu, Third Brother Gu, what’s your take on this battle?” Someone pointed to the back.</p><p>The crowd parted to reveal Gu Qinger, carrying a sword wheel on his back and thrusting Nine Swords into the air. He walked over silently and sat on a large rock in front of the Dao Imparting Mirror, looking displeased.</p><p>On the other hand, Gu Qingsan kept a smile on his face and waved at the crowd. “I think Xu Xiaoshou will win. He’s incredibly strong. After all, I taught him some Point of Path back in the day.”</p><p>“Oh? The Point of Path of the Three Thousand Sword Styles? You have such a connection?”</p><p>“Yes, my second senior brother was also saved by Xu Xiaoshou on Abyss Island. We do have a good connection…”</p><p>Gu Qinger shot him a glare.</p><p>“Hahaha!” Gu Qingsan scratched his head with a chuckle and pointed to the back. “You should be asking my little junior sister these questions.”</p><p>Everyone turned to see a young lady in white, holding a heavy black sword, walking over with measured steps.</p><p>“Su Qianqian!”</p><p>“Her luck is incredible. When she was in the Yunlun Mountain Range, Sword Deity Wen Ting from afar accepted her as a disciple… Oh my god, I wish I had that kind of luck!”</p><p>“Look over there, is that the Myriad Weapons Demon Ancestor? I heard that the Holy Divine Palace offered a huge reward at that time. Anyone who handed it over would rise to the top… But who would hand it over?”</p><p>“I know, the Devil Sword specifically sought out Su Qianqian. It took many twists and turns to avoid the Holy Divine Palace’s search net!”</p><p>“Wow, this girl is a bit terrifying. Not only is she extremely talented, but even famed swords are scrambling to reach her. I heard she was once the sword-bearer of Epitaph of City Snow?”</p><p>“I know! And the entire Su family challenged the Eighth Sword Deity one after another and all perished in battle… Sigh, I can only say the Su family is full of pride and courage!”</p><p>“Shh…”</p><p>Su Qianqian walked over calmly amidst the crowd’s chatter.</p><p>Just as her Senior Brothers once defended her, now it was something everyone was used to.</p><p>She had also begun to understand the meaning of not being joyful for things or sorrowful for oneself. She no longer held an excessive attachment to the past.</p><p>“He will win.” Su Qianqian calmly raised her eyes and looked at the Dao Imparting Mirror as she spoke softly.</p><p>“Oh? Are you also supporting Xu Xiaoshou? Oh, I forgot you have your history… By the way, where’s your Eldest Senior Brother?” Someone turned to ask.</p><p>“He’s preparing for the next battle.”</p><p>“What battle?”</p><p>“The upcoming battle, a past promise to meet at the peak.”</p><p>…</p><p>Fringe Moon Immortal City.</p><p>Blood flowed everywhere, and bones littered the ground.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong, wielding the Kongtong Formless Sword, carved a bloody path to the Dao Imparting Mirror. After glancing at the figure displayed, he laughed and turned back to continue his fight.</p><p>…</p><p>Dongtianwang City.</p><p>At the pilgrimage square, in front of the former site of the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>Dong Ling and Shi Ti of the Magic Pill Technicians Association, Nangong Yin and Yuan Haisheng of the Night Cat, and the new Pavilion Master and Sect Master of the Returning Sound Pavilion and Great Xuantian Sect… all looked up attentively.</p><p>…</p><p>Half-Moon Bay.</p><p>The Bazhun’an, Storyteller, Dao Qiongcang, Gou Wuyue, Wei Feng, and others, all stood with their arms around each other, closely watching the figure.</p><p>“I had a feeling about this.”</p><p>“Be quiet!”</p><p>“Thus Greedy the Cat Spirit, to be honest, I had anticipated that it was either not contracted or was contracted…”</p><p>“Stop talking nonsense. It’s either life or death. Isn’t living the same as being contracted? You’ve already given two possibilities, is that Finger Pinching Divination? My brother could do that too.”</p><p>“Only women and villains are hard to deal with.”</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, are you calling me a villain?”</p><p>“A gentleman does not insult. Instead, he offers advice.”</p><p>“You!”</p><p>…</p><p>Four-hill mountain.</p><p>On Thunder Peak, in front of a solitary Dao Imparting Mirror, there were too many old fellows scratching their heads and faces.</p><p>Long Rongzhi, Lou Yu, Chi Jia, Da Yao, Xiao Yao, Mu Ling…</p><p>The younger ones were only Bai Lian and Hua Ying, who had come here to observe out of respect for the elder Long Rongzhi.</p><p>High above, a white dragon with a jade-like body coiled, holding a little girl on its head.</p><p>She wore purple clothes, had a tender face, and her hair was styled in two buns. She was playful and cute but spoke with an old-fashioned tone.</p><p>“Is this Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“That’s right.” Lou Yu pointed at him and then shifted his finger. “This traitor is Ye Xiaotian! But he has Spatial Upanishad…”</p><p>“Then don’t call him a traitor!”</p><p>“Oh, Lord Zi Chong is willing to protect him. Ye Xiaotian’s ancestors are surely smiling. He’ll survive the battle.”</p><p>“Let’s watch the show.”</p><p>“Alright, Lord Zi Chong.”</p><p>…</p><p>From Acquired Stage Spiritual Cultivation to demi-saint Holy Emperor.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou never imagined that one day his dream would come true so naturally, with the whole world paying attention to him.</p><p>At this moment, he saw the Dao Imparting Mirror focusing on him, showing a broad grin to the world. He shifted his gaze back to Beibei.</p><p>“This is such a grand event, and we’ve invited so many esteemed seniors to attend. Ending it hastily would be disrespectful to everyone here and those watching in the mirror.”</p><p>“Let’s add some excitement. How about that?”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui grabbed the Dao Imparting Mirror and zoomed in on Beibei’s expression.</p><p>Beibei’s face was stiff, and her expression was unnatural.</p><p>Clearly, she understood the significance of the Dao Imparting Mirror and how many people were watching her.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
