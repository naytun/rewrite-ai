Or rather, he had spoken up for the ‘convention’ of the ancient swordsman.</p><p>Even Master Siren…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked over and realized that his Teacher, who was usually kind, did not look at him at all this time. His expression was calm, but oh that deep furrow between his eyebrows…</p><p>He was not being calm, rather it was the case of ‘out of sight, out of mind’!</p><p>The old sword saint clearly knew what his student was like.</p><p>Since he knew that persuasion was futile, Xu Xiaoshou was right from his point of view.</p><p>That was because he was determined to stand on Beibei’s side. He could not speak up for Xu Xiaoshou, but he would also not ignore his position and speak up for Beibei, who was on the opposing side.</p><p>It would be better to keep quiet!</p><p>He looked at Beibei with pity. He knew that she would face Xu Xiaoshou, and the little girl would suffer a lot.</p><p>“You guys make it seem as if I am the one at fault here…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but smile bitterly, but his heart was deeply moved.</p><p>He had been in the Spiritual Cultivation world for too long, especially after he faced the sinister Dao Qiongcang. He realized that he had also been corrupted.</p><p>Even someone as intelligent as myself became like this.</p><p>These stubborn ancient swordsman had never changed.</p><p>Should he say that they were conservative, or should he describe them as people who would rather break than bend?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not too sure, but he suddenly understood why the ancient swordsman were so unique in the Spiritual Cultivation world.</p><p>In today’s world, there were too many people who would go with the flow. There were also those who yearned for new ways and worshipped foreign methods.</p><p>However, there were very few people who could still persist in the ancient rites and pass on the culture and character of the ancient era for decades when they had no encouragement.</p><p>This was the ancient swordsman!</p><p>A gentleman should be cautious when he is alone and even more so, when there was no supervision.</p><p>Those who could do this would naturally be able to persevere in the major sects, and then stand out among the crowd.</p><p>They might not be understood, but their spirit was indeed worthy of respect!</p><p>“Fight for the fame…”</p><p>As he stroked the thick invitation letter in his hand, he looked at the ancient swordsman Beibei, who stood there and endured the humiliation. He could feel the wind and snow around him. Xu Xiaoshou finally understood the meaning of this sentence.</p><p>This fame definitely did not refer to the fame of the Seven Sword Deity.</p><p>This battle wasn’t just to enhance the fame of the seven.</p><p>The ranking of the Seven Sword Deity and the competition of the Seven Sword Deity were just a formality.</p><p>The true inheritance was the spirit of the era of the ancient swordsman. Its aim was to continue the spirit of ‘moving forward courageously and never bending’ that the name of ‘ancient swordsman’ represented!</p><p>In the Spiritual Cultivation era, under the opposition of so many sinister villains, this was an extremely precious treasure.</p><p>“A group of wanderers…”</p><p>Swish.</p><p>Under everyone’s gaze, Xu Xiaoshou sighed and stood up from the ghostly energy throne.</p><p>He restrained his playful attitude and became very solemn. He waved the invitation letter in his hand and said seriously.</p><p>“First of all, I apologize for the joke I made just now.”</p><p>“Ah… apologize?”</p><p>Beibei raised her sword and was stunned.</p><p>Was it because she had experienced too much shock in one day that she actually started to hallucinate?</p><p>The arrogant Xu Xiaoshou even humiliated Hallmaster Xuanji before he killed her…Uh, insulted her, I mean.</p><p>Now, he apologized to me?</p><p>Could it be that he likes me?</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s God Devil Eyes that spun wildly slowed down and she was also stunned.</p><p>This did not match her impression of Xu Xiaoshou. Had he been possessed?</p><p>Only Lei Shuangxing smiled and shook his head.</p><p>Behind him, Mei Siren was stunned for a moment before he laughed out loud and took out his paper fan.</p><p>“Brat, you dare?”</p><p>Stunned, the old man saw that he could actually see the words, ‘This child is teachable’ on the other side. He hurriedly flipped the paper fan over and continued to fan it as if nothing had happened.</p><p>Only an ancient swordsman understood another ancient swordsman.</p><p>However, the female ancient swordsman did not quite understand…</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, are you sick?” Beibei shook her head in front of everyone. “I won’t accept it, and I am not in love with you.”</p><p>What?</p><p>Before Xu Xiaoshou could even finish the second half of his sentence, he was speechless.</p><p>No, did you jump to some 18+ forbidden channel? Did you think too far ahead and misunderstood something?</p><p>“What I mean is…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held back his laughter and shook the invitation letter in his hand hard to get the topic back on track.</p><p>“I noted your respect.”</p><p>“I can see how serious you are about the fame of the Seven Sword Deity.”</p><p>“I apologize for my rudeness just now. This apology is mostly directed at your identity as an ancient swordsman… Of course, some of it is also meant for you, but not much of it.”</p><p>Beibei’s face reddened when she heard the first half of his sentence. She knew she had misunderstood. When she heard the second half, her face darkened and she rolled her eyes.</p><p>“You’re really insane! You even need to distinguish so clearly between your apologies. Did you have to speak so confidently so that it would make you appear confident?”</p><p>“You can interpret it in that manner…” Xu Xiaoshou shrugged and his serious expression vanished. With a hint of mockery, he said, “But from your invitation letter, I saw not only respect, but also some form of teasing.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Beibei frowned. Although the order came from Hallmaster Xuanji, she was very serious about the battle.</p><p>“Three days…” Xu Xiaoshou pointed at the bronze letter and said with a faint smile.</p><p>“Do you think I’m a fool? Three days later, it’ll be too late. This isn’t the way to stall for time.”</p><p>“Let me guess who did you really invite to deal with me…Yue Gongli, Ai Cangsheng?”</p><p>After a pause, Xu Xiaoshou snorted and said, ” Where’s your confidence, Beibei?Don’t you know it’s a great taboo to be so timid before a fight!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
