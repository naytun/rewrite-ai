He drew out Hidden Bitter and chopped at the white tail behind his waist.</p><p>As a result, the white tail grabbed him and began spinning in circles in the sky…</p><p>To onlookers, it looked just like a cat chasing its tail.</p><p>“Tsk.” Yu Zhiwen covered her mouth and laughed.</p><p>She wondered if ghost beast transformation was supposed to be a serious, life-or-death matter.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou’s ghost beast form looked so…cute.</p><p>What started as a serious issue and a serious negotiation shifted completely when Xu Xiaoshou raised his sword and began playing with his tail.</p><p>Everyone in the city was watching this farce.</p><p>Fang Wenxin couldn’t respond. He looked at the young man spinning in the sky and slowly closed his eyes.</p><p>Being young was truly wonderful…</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The Xuanji great array trembled.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen snapped back to reality and realized she had lost control of the great array.</p><p>When she looked up, a dignified figure appeared in the sky above Jade Capital City and declared, “Xu Xiaoshou’s contracted ghost beast is spreading lies and confusing the public!”</p><p>“The dangers of the Body of Devour are obvious to all. To ignore the drawbacks and only promote the benefits while spreading the path of ghost beast form is utterly unjust!”</p><p>“Today, I order the three Saints to work together to capture Xu Xiaoshou. No more delays or procrastination. Those who disobey will face severe punishment!”</p><p>Everyone looked on in shock.</p><p>“Hallmaster Xuanji!”</p><p>“The Hallmaster has returned. She’s indeed alive. Xu Xiaoshou deserves punishment!”</p><p>“Xuanji… Uh, cough cough, Hallmaster’s words are quite apt!”</p><p>…</p><p>Not just the people in the city, but also the Saints on the city walls turned to look.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou heard that repugnant tone, he also stopped his actions and turned back in surprise.</p><p>“Dao Xuanji, you dare show your face again? Aren’t you afraid I’ll kill you again?”</p><p>Dao Xuanji gave a cold, scornful smile as he looked at Xu Xiaoshou, who was left in such a pitiful state that he resembled neither a human nor a ghost. Dao Xuanji’s lips curled with disdain.</p><p>“What a joke.”</p><p>D*mn! This statement hit Xu Xiaoshou’s biggest pain point.</p><p>He usually didn’t fall for such provocations, but this time, it was different.</p><p>With a whoosh, white fur sprouted behind Xu Xiaoshou’s ears and stood on end.</p><p>The white tail behind his waist also stood upright, and even his butt arched high… then slammed down.</p><p>“Dao Xuanji, you’re courting death!”</p><p>The roar was accompanied by a storm of blood-black ghostly energy, exploding everywhere.</p><p>In the hazy scene, everyone saw the three blood lines on Xu Xiaoshou’s forehead become extremely prominent. The fluffy white tail behind his waist swept out and transformed into nine tails.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>He thrust out a claw, which not only wielded his power but also some force from the God Punishment Tribulation that didn’t belong to him, and slammed it into the Xuanji great array.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The great array of the water screen illusion was not shattered this time.</p><p>Dao Xuanji, inside the great array, looked on with contempt. As long as she stayed within the array, she believed Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t possibly kill her again.</p><p>Even if he was enraged, if the three Saints joined forces, he would be easily subdued!</p><p>At that moment…</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s attention was drawn to the strange look in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes as he glared fiercely at her.</p><p>She noticed three gray floral spots shifting rapidly in the left eye, which resembled a cat’s, and they quickly vanished.</p><p>“Mind-changing Aperture?”</p><p>“No! Three Loathsome Eyes!”</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s face turned ashen.</p><p>She tried to look away, but her mind buzzed with a thunderous noise.</p><p>Her thoughts were scrambled…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pressed down on the Xuanji great array with his claws. His cat-like form bounced up with a thud, flipped in the air, and then settled onto the newly formed throne of ghostly energy.</p><p>The nine tails behind him swept out.</p><p>Holy Power splattered beneath his feet.</p><p>He crossed his legs, tilted his head, and let the ghostly energy burst from his Three Loathsome Eyes like lightning. He shouted coldly, “B*tch, get out of the great array!”</p><p>His roar was so forceful it nearly caused everyone’s ears to ring.</p><p>When they looked up again…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was seated atop the ghostly energy throne, acting recklessly!</p><p>Inside the great array, Hallmaster Xuanji trembled, as if a cat following its owner’s command, and dared to move forward.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“Hallmaster Xuanji, wake up!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, stop this madness!”</p><p>Above the city, Fang Wenxin, Elder Yu, Zhong Yuanzi, and the three Saints were all astonished.</p><p>No one had expected the situation to change so rapidly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s transformation into a ghost beast and the inheritance of the Body of Devour from the Greedy the Cat Spirit was already terrifying, but the Three Loathsome Eyes…</p><p>Was this Xu Xiaoshou’s power? Or had he inherited it from the Greedy the Cat Spirit?</p><p>“Greedy the Cat Spirit!”</p><p>The Saints recalled that the Greedy the Cat Spirit not only had the Three Loathsome Eyes but also the Three Tribulation Eyes.</p><p>It seemed these abilities had indeed been inherited by Xu Xiaoshou after his transformation into a ghost beast.</p><p>Who could defend against that?</p><p>Dao Xuanji had been meticulous, but she hadn’t considered this.</p><p>On the other hand, Xu Xiaoshou was like a highly sensitive trigger. The moment he activated his Three Loathsome Eyes, it was instant!</p><p>It was all happening too quickly!</p><p>Despite this, the Saints were not slow to react. The three demi-saints were indeed worthy of their title.</p><p>As Dao Xuanji trembled and struggled under the orders, nearly forced out of the Xuanji great array…</p><p>The three Saints launched their attacks on Xu Xiaoshou, who was seated on the ghostly energy throne.</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi unleashed ten different types of energy from his fingertips…</p><p>Fang Wenxin sent out nine Blood Shadow copper coins in rapid succession…</p><p>Elder Yu was numb with shock. He wanted to retreat as he flew, but he could only shout, “Zhong Yuanzi, stop your divine arts!”</p><p>On the ghostly energy throne, Xu Xiaoshou laughed and rose into the air.</p><p>“Good timing!” He bent forward, then straightened up and inhaled.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
