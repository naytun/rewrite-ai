It had not chopped off its head with a single strike, but it had retracted its head. Xu Xiaoshou had made so many preparations in vain.</p><p>“Swish swish swish…”</p><p>The spirit threads in the air trembled as Xu Xiaoshou controlled the two halves of Dao Xuanji’s body to seal his energy reserve and stop any variable. He was deep in thought.</p><p>His Weaving Expertise had already reached Holy Emperor Level 0.</p><p>However, this was the first time he had controlled the body of a demi-saint.</p><p>After quickly analyzing Dao Xuanji’s life pattern, he confirmed that it was a human body and not a Divine Puppet.</p><p>In other words, according to Zhong Yuanzi’s experiment…</p><p>Dao Xuanji was dead, and this was her true body. She could only resurrect as a demi-saint.</p><p>This was a demi-saint incarnation, and her main body would be severely injured. The consumption of a demi-saint incarnation was too great. In the short term, it was almost as if she lost one life.</p><p>Today, he could still take Dao Xuanji’s life.</p><p>In the future, he might not be able to cut away all variables.</p><p>“Interesting…”</p><p>He could sense the countless complicated Divine Secrets Array in Dao Xuanji’s body. Although half of it had been cut off by the Flame Python, it could actually repair itself as if it had consciousness.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was extremely curious.</p><p>He finally understood how Dao Qiongcang and Dao Xuanji’s indestructible bodies had done it.</p><p>The two of them actually treated themselves as Divine Puppets and used their bodies to inscribe divine path patterns. They were incomparably crazy.</p><p>After years of accumulation, the traces of the Divine Secret left on their bodies were almost more than the traces on the body of Divine Oracle Number Two!</p><p>Not only that, even the physical body itself…</p><p>“Was it modified by spirit herbs and other natural treasures, or was it directly changed into something else?” Xu Xiaoshou asked as if he did not understand, as if he was treating his own family, completely not polite.</p><p>Dao Xuanji stared at the youth.</p><p>From the intention of the spirit thread in his hands, she could read the secrets he was exploring in her body.</p><p>She could also analyze that Xu Xiaoshou understood Divine Secrets, but he seemed to know nothing about the essence of Divine Secrets.</p><p>However, his attainments in this path were extremely high…</p><p>It was as if a mighty figure had enlightened him with something, but he had not mastered it.</p><p>This kind of person would be very powerful in deciphering the Divine Secret</p><p>However, if he were to fight with the Divine Secret as his foundation, it would be very difficult for him to do anything unexpected.</p><p>Of course, Dao Xuanji knew what Xu Xiaoshou was asking. This question further accentuated his ignorance!</p><p>As for the answer…</p><p>How could she explain?</p><p>“I was a bit lacking, I admit it.”</p><p>After understanding Xu Xiaoshou’s Divine Secret proficiency level, the hatred in Dao Xuanji’s eyes dissipated, and his gaze returned to its empty state.</p><p>In Xu Xiaoshou’s perception, all the divine path patterns in Dao Xuanji’s body suddenly lit up.</p><p>“Next time, you will die even more miserably than me.”</p><p>“I hope that by that time, you have refined more than one clone.”</p><p>After saying that, Dao Xuanji’s body suddenly swelled.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression changed. Was this the self-destruction of a demi-saint?</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>He held the thread with both hands and wanted to stop it before dissecting Dao Xuanji.</p><p>This action seemed to have angered a certain layer of Divine Secrets Array and instead accelerated the self-destruction process.</p><p>“Goodbye.”</p><p>The corners of Dao Xuanji’s lips curled up. He closed his eyes and his body suddenly exploded…</p><p>“You want to have fun? That’s impossible!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glared angrily and grabbed Time Ancestor Shadow Staff in exasperation.</p><p>“Reverse!”</p><p>…</p><p>Dao Xuanji ignited all the Divine Secrets Array in his body. Just as he chose to self-destruct, he suddenly heard sword cries in the distance.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>Just as her body swelled up, Fourth Sword came from the back to the front and strung the two halves of her body together.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>The endless demonic aura was wantonly destroying the vitality of the human body and the Divine Secrets Array.</p><p>Dao Xuanji was like a balloon that had suddenly expanded to its limit. In an instant, it was filled with energy and deflated on the spot.</p><p>Her face was stunned as she turned around in disbelief and saw the black-robed young man…</p><p>“Ah, goodbye ~”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou mimicked his words in a sarcastic tone. The corners of his lips curled up and he closed his eyes.</p><p>He had Fourth Sword in his hand and displayed the Acquired (Stage) spiritual technique, the White Cloud Sword Technique Fleeting White Clouds.</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s two parts were dismembered into countless pieces, which were devoured by the Dragon Apricot’s branch.</p><p>…</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>At the Back Mountain of Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, Xuanji Cave.</p><p>A naked woman who was bathing in a medicinal vat suddenly opened her eyes. She stood up from the medicinal vat and covered her head with her hand as she let out a sharp cry.</p><p>“Chi chi…”</p><p>The medicinal liquid splashed and the fragrance spread.</p><p>However, Dao Xuanji’s hair was disheveled and he looked like a mad demon as he roared,</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, how dare you humiliate me like this? I must kill you! I must kill you!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
