Master Siren couldn’t teach such flamboyant stuff.”</p><p>Bazhun’an did not even turn his head: “Is it possible that after being with you for a while, anyone would become somewhat flamboyant? Especially since he was already a flirt?”</p><p>…</p><p>How outrageous!</p><p>Under the attitude befitting an emperor, Beibei was furious yet speechless.</p><p>Under the suppression of Absolute Imperial Control, Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t psychologically shattered, it didn’t even seem difficult for him, and he could still make bold declarations?</p><p>What a blatant disdain!</p><p>The boundless ocean was the epitome of the attack from the Ten Thousand Sword Technique. The charged-up and consolidated Sword Will could surge forward in waves, toppling people over.</p><p>This thrust aimed at the throat could unleash ten thousand swords from Jade Capital City, while famous swords from all around contributed their Sword Will, offering support from all directions like loyal subjects protecting their monarch.</p><p>Yet, even so, as Beibei’s sword lunged towards Xu Xiaoshou’s throat, this guy still acted as if he saw nothing.</p><p>“Fantasy Sword Technique?”</p><p>Beibei’s pupils narrowed.</p><p>At the same time, she heard Feng Zhongzui’s cry:</p><p>“Fantasy Sword Technique, this is the Fantasy Sword Technique!”</p><p>“Don’t forget, everyone, Lord Shou was not only a student of Master Siren but had also been with the Eighth Sword Immortal for a while.”</p><p>“And as everyone knows, the Eighth Sword Immortal is skilled in the Fantasy Sword Technique. Even his named disciple, Xiao Kongtong, is good at it. How could Xu Xiaoshou not specialize in it?”</p><p>Beibei’s mind reacted, changing her sword technique on the fly, turning the cut aimed at the throat into a downward suppression.</p><p>“Heart Sword Technique, my mind is clear, break!”</p><p>A burst of golden light exploded, turning the offensive waves into a defensive bubble around her, attempting to break through the Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>At the very least, she had to find a flaw or boundary in the Fantasy Sword Technique, right?</p><p>Nothing!</p><p>Beibei scanned the horizon and the world seemed utterly real, without a single flaw.</p><p>Had the Fantasy Sword Technique already been dispelled?</p><p>Was the Fantasy Sword Technique still in effect, but undetected?</p><p>It was then, before she could figure it out, she saw Xu Xiaoshou in front of her move.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gently thrust Hidden Bitter forward in the slowest, most easily defensible, but also the most bizarre stuttering manner, piercing the sword tip into the utterly unguarded chest of Beibei.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>This Xu Xiaoshou, who during her sword thrust at his throat, was so obviously fake, showing not a hint of panic or retreat or defense, whose movements of drawing the sword were so exaggeratedly fake, clearly an illusion.</p><p>His sword brought the most real pain!</p><p>Beibei numbly looked down at her chest, seeing a large pool of blood spilling out, feeling the piercing pain in her heart.</p><p>And at that moment, she heard Feng Zhongzui’s scream again:</p><p>“What did I just see?”</p><p>“Lord Shou used my voice for his Fantasy Sword Technique, with just a few words and in combination with his odd movements, easily deceived Sword Deity Bei?”</p><p>“The sword of Supreme Emperor Sword, he himself stripped away its Force; the grade three spiritual sword Hidden Bitter, just like that, easily breached the defense? Attacking the mind is paramount, only now is this called the Fantasy Sword Technique!”</p><p>Beibei’s pupils trembled fiercely, and her face flushed with color.</p><p>If before that stabbing had yet to awaken her, the “truly heart-piercing” statement was what utterly broke her on the spot.</p><p>Was there no Fantasy Sword Technique?</p><p>Or was the Fantasy Sword Technique not perceived at the moment she “realized” it, but rather arose in the wake of that realization?</p><p>Had she dared to make the cut at that time, would it have been Xu Xiaoshou’s neck that was severed by the boundless ocean?</p><p>Regret was too late!</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>Hidden Bitter was pulled out from Beibei’s chest, lightly touched, causing Beibei’s hand holding the sword to soften, knocking away the Supreme Emperor Sword.</p><p>Using minimal force to overcome the strong.</p><p>But the determination of victory and defeat, wasn’t it a bit too swift?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned; his anticipated ardent duel with Sword Immortals, where both sides would fight with all their might, was unfulfilled.</p><p>He still wanted to steal more…</p><p>Quickly though, Xu Xiaoshou cleared his head of stray thoughts and realized the reason, his tone indifferent:</p><p>“Ancient swordsmen are indifferent to Present Gods and Buddhas, I hold too high and too strong a position in your heart, so strong that I don’t even need to make a move, and you’ve already failed.”</p><p>“You haven’t lost to me, you’ve lost to yourself.”</p><p>Paused. Hidden Bitter swiftly drew across, puncturing the major artery on the side of Beibei’s snow-white neck, blood gushing like a fountain.</p><p>“To borrow a phrase from someone…”</p><p>“With my sword, I slay the gods in your heart, hoping you will take it to heart.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
