So, what’s left to do?</p><p>“I don’t believe it. I still can’t believe it…”</p><p>“There’s too much information! Is Hallmaster Xuanji really this weak, or is Lord Shou really this strong?”</p><p>“She’s Dao Xuanji! She’s Hallmaster Dao’s sister! How could she be killed by Xu Xiaoshou twice in one day? Is he a demi-saint?”</p><p>“Shh! Bro, be quiet. It’s disrespectful to call a Saint’s name directly…”</p><p>“I couldn’t care less about respect! I’ve been in Jade Capital City for over thirty years. What haven’t I seen? The Holy Divine Palace has never been so embarrassed as it has with Dao Xuanji today.”</p><p>“If Hallmaster Dao were still here, would Xu Xiaoshou dare to be so impudent? Is there no one in Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe who can handle him?”</p><p>“Sigh…”</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang! Dao Qiongcang!”</p><p>“D*mn, are you serious? Stop shouting…”</p><p>“Dao… Oh, let go of me. I can’t stand looking at this damned Xuanji anymore!”</p><p>…</p><p>The city was plunged into doubt and chaos.</p><p>After all, at the foot of the Holy Mountain, supporting the Holy Divine Palace was the mainstream.</p><p>Though the villain in the eyes of the world, Xu Xiaoshou, was unpopular, he was overjoyed at this moment.</p><p>“Awesome!”</p><p>From high above the ghostly energy throne, as Xu Xiaoshou watched the Fourth Sword pierce through Dao Xuanji’s head by unraveling the illusion, he felt a deep sense of satisfaction and release.</p><p>This was the first time he had used the Fantasy Sword Technique on a demi-saint without detection.</p><p>“When the Bazhun’an arrives, they’ll all have to praise ‘wonderful to the finest’!” Xu Xiaoshou was extremely pleased.</p><p>It was undeniable that this was another sneak attack.</p><p>Upon careful reflection, Dao Xuanji had still underestimated her enemy.</p><p>In a life-or-death battle for the robbing path, it was nothing like a Platform Competition. There were no honorable codes of conduct to follow.</p><p>That was nonsense!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had learned from Dao Qiongcang just how hard it was to kill a Divine Sorcerer.</p><p>To deal with such a person, one had to land a decisive blow.</p><p>Otherwise, it would become a prolonged tug-of-war, dragging on and falling into the opponent’s rhythm.</p><p>Who knew what kind of accident or variable might occur, allowing Dao Xuanji to turn the tables? At that time, it would be Xu Xiaoshou who would suffer.</p><p>But with the Fourth Sword piercing through, all variables would be eliminated.</p><p>Unless Dao Xuanji was also an ancient swordsman…</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could tell at a glance that Dao Xuanji didn’t know any Ancient Sword Techniques. He couldn’t even sense the aura of Innate Sword Intent on her.</p><p>If the sword pierced through the body, the person would die!</p><p>He leaned on top of the ghostly energy throne and looked around.</p><p>At this moment, he finally felt that after all the hardship, he had the appearance of a noble and invincible figure.</p><p>Calculating the time…</p><p>Ever since Xu Xiaoshou woke up and fought against the Saint, he had used the Profound Dao Seed to comprehend the Life Upanishad and contracted the ghost beast.</p><p>Jade Capital City was plunged into darkness, with no distinction between day and night. Xu Xiaoshou had been blocking this door for over a day.</p><p>This day was not short!</p><p>At the foot of Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, at the entrance of Jade Capital City.</p><p>The Holy Divine Palace was blocked by the leader of the so-called “dark power” for more than a day, and the new Hallmaster was killed twice…</p><p>If word got out, it would be a huge joke!</p><p>Even when You Tu, the leader of the Seven Sword Deity, attacked the Sacred Mountain and beheaded the previous Hallmaster, it was not this exaggerated.</p><p>After all, he managed to suppress the ugliness at that time.</p><p>Now, with everyone having watched and rumors having flown everywhere, it soon spread to every corner of the five regions, becoming the talk of the town and a favorite subject of gossip.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced coldly.</p><p>Everyone in the Jade Capital City trembled.</p><p>At that moment, no one dared to look him in the eye!</p><p>The old demi-saints were terrified. They didn’t expect Xu Xiaoshou to be so ruthless!</p><p>Really…</p><p>There was nothing more frivolous than this!</p><p>Back then, the Bazhun’an did not come to Jade Capital City, and Xu Xiaoshou directly killed Dao Xuanji and mocked her.</p><p>How could this scene be described as “ruthless”?</p><p>…</p><p>“After being blocked for so long, the only ones Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe can bring out are the Three Saints, Elder Yu, Zhong Yuanzi, and Fang Wenxin.”</p><p>“That’s probably what I thought. Either Dao Xuanji lacks popular support, or all the important figures have gone to the God Slayer Ruins.”</p><p>“The Scared Mountain is empty… Elder Sang should have come out of the ruins by now. I could pick him up and leave today.”</p><p>“Do I still need his little gift? What a loss, what a loss…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked coldly at the face deformed by the vicious sword in the distance and shook his head.</p><p>She was too weak, not half as good as his brother!</p><p>If it were Dao Qiongcang, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t believe he would fall for such a shallow trick. Dao Xuanji didn’t even guard against the Three Loathsome Eyes, nor did she see through the Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>In terms of battle consciousness, Dao Xuanji lost to her brother by more than half a point.</p><p>At the critical moment, she couldn’t use the Divine Thirty-Six Form!</p><p>He still remembered that in the self-destruction scene of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man sent over by Dragon Apricot, the Elder Dao the Flamboyant could cast the Divine Secret that covered the sky with just a thought.</p><p>However, he only took a glance at the crowd. As a demi-saint, he was forced into self-destruction to survive.</p><p>That was what it meant to be oppressed!</p><p>Dao Xuanji was just a loser.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that she lacked actual combat experience, and her battle consciousness should not have reached the third realm.</p><p>Even if she had reached two realms, he would still have doubts.</p><p>Being defeated twice was enough to prove there were many problems. Whether she was meticulous or not, and whether she was capable enough were both open to question.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
