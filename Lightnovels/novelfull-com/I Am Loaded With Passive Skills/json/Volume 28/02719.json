He had no spiritual source defense and almost turned into a Sleeveless red scorched Ye!</p><p>Fortunately, he had become a demi-saint and his body had undergone a qualitative leap.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took advantage of this short period of time and started to eat heartily of this feast from behind. With the help of his Breathing Technique, he swallowed the destructive energy into his stomach.</p><p>“Hot!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian shrieked in alarm.</p><p>Just as he was about to reprimand Xu Xiaoshou for his actions, he suddenly saw Xu Xiaoshou’s body swell up after he swallowed the chaotic energy of the weapon prohibition order.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>His sacred physique cracked.</p><p>There were even cracks that appeared all over his body.</p><p>He emitted a charred smell, and at the same time, there was a faint fragrance of life…</p><p>Ye Xiaotian fell silent.</p><p>He knew how strong Xu Xiaoshou’s body was.</p><p>This guy’s method of rescue was indeed very tricky and looked very brutal. He actually had to silently endure the pain of his body explosion!</p><p>In comparison…</p><p>He had only been scorched for a moment, but he already complained incessantly. It was beneath his dignity as a demi-saint.</p><p>“Thank you for your hard work.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian felt a lump in his throat. He felt that his efforts were worth it. Xu Xiaoshou was a person who knew how to repay others.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>After he absorbed that violent power, Xu Xiaoshou felt that the Dragon Pearl was almost close to bursting.</p><p>As for Ye Xiaotian, he still had more than thirty weapon prohibition orders on him…</p><p>He didn’t say anything. He breathed out a mouthful of vitality spiritual energy at the teary-eyed Master Dean and continued with his rescue work.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>“Boom…”</p><p>The sky rumbled continuously.</p><p>The people in Jade Capital City felt their scalps go numb. They felt that this was the prelude to a storm.</p><p>However, the people present did not share the same thoughts.</p><p>Just like how Xu Xiaoshou and Mei Siren did not disrupt Fang Wenxin’s attempt to suppress the ghost beast, Elder Yu watched quietly as the young fellow swallowed copious amounts of the explosive energy to resolve Ye Xiaotian’s predicament. His body was covered in wounds.</p><p>He was rather moved.</p><p>This young man had some redeeming qualities.</p><p>At the very least, he was willing to risk his life for his own people!</p><p>He glanced at the obedient Little Yu who was at the city wall of the Southern Zone. Xu Xiaoshou had already disappeared behind her, and Elder Yu released the little grudge he had previously.</p><p>Both sides seemed to have a tacit understanding.</p><p>Neither of them wanted to interrupt each other.</p><p>As an outsider, Elder Yu was touched by the scene even as Xu Xiaoshou absorbed the nutrients amid his pain and joy.</p><p>“(Passive Fist, charge point : 25.38%).”</p><p>“(Passive Fist, charge point : 31.66%).”</p><p>“(Passive Fist, charge point : 52.43%).”</p><p>“(Passive Fist, charge point :: 93.79%).”</p><p>After the battle on Abyss Island and since his strength had increased, Xu Xiaoshou had not suffered any major injuries.</p><p>One of the few that could hurt him was the Holy Emperor Bei Huai.</p><p>However, that fellow cultivated the way of spirit and soul. The one who attacked was the Holy Emperor Qilin.</p><p>Therefore, compared to the increase in the charge points of the Disillusionment Finger, the Passive Fist was very much slower.</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou was replete!</p><p>After he devoured all of the 30-plus weapon prohibition orders on Ye Xiaotian, he looked at his two special passive skills:</p><p>“Disillusionment Finger, charge point : 91.09%.”</p><p>“Passive Fist, charge point: 108.86%.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fell silent.</p><p>He had secretly accumulated the charge point of the Finger of Disillusionment when he watched the battle between the God of War and Bei Huai. He had borrowed the influence of Bei Huai’s Holy Emperor level soul power.</p><p>This had already broken through the limit and surpassed the peak when he shot down Rao Yaoyao’s soul. It had reached the highest point in history.</p><p>But now, after he used his body to withstand the explosive energy of more than thirty weapon prohibition orders, his Passive Fist had broken through 100%…</p><p>It could even break through 100%?</p><p>After the Disillusionment Finger reached 86.34%, Rao Yaoyao could only rely on the spiritual sword to actively disintegrate the remnant thoughts and survive, before she was executed.</p><p>Then this Passive Fist broke the limit…</p><p>Could Dao Xuanji’s main body withstand it?</p><p>Could the main body of a Holy Emperor take it?</p><p>If he used both methods, the left Passive Fist and the right Disillusionment Finger…Could Bazhun’an, Kui Leihan, Dao Qiongcang, and the others handle it?</p><p>“Thank you, thank you.”</p><p>As he stood in front of him, Ye Xiaotian who seemed to have received a pardon, thanked him profusely as he adjusted to his newfound strength.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked weak. He waved his hands and didn’t say anything.</p><p>“I know, I will remember this. If you’re in trouble in the future, just call me!” Ye Xiaotian patted his chest and made a promise…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was revived to full health!</p><p>What can’t kill me will only make me stronger!</p><p>At this moment, he felt as if he had the tattoo of the Azure Dragon on his left and the White Tiger on the right. He felt inexplicably heroic as if he had fought with a prodigy.</p><p>He glanced sideways.</p><p>Fang Wenxin used the resonance power of the ten Great Psionic Weapons to directly cross the barriers of time and space. This made Greedy the Cat Spirit tremble and lose its mind.</p><p>The enormous hand formed by the Thousand Ghost Soul Catcher technique behind him whooshed with ghostly energy and had already extracted more than half of Greedy the Cat Spirit’s divine soul.</p><p>Both sides were still in a stalemate!</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit had clearly never swallowed the power to battle against the divine soul.</p><p>Otherwise, the Blood Shadow copper coins’ Ten Thousand Ghost Soul Capture technique would not have been so easy to deal with.</p><p>“Old Senior Fang!”</p><p>After he saved Ye Xiaotian, Xu Xiaoshou looked at Fang Wenxin from afar under Elder Yu’s watchful gaze.</p><p>“What do you want to do?”</p><p>Elder Yu felt a little regretful.</p><p>This fellow had broken the tacit agreement between gentlemen. After he saved people, he still wanted to interfere in the affairs of the ghost beast?</p><p>“Zhong Yuanzi!”</p><p>He called out to Elder Zhong, but there was no response. He hurriedly threw out his fishing rod and reeled in that fluffy afro.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you’d better behave yourself!”</p><p>Elder Yu threatened as he held on to the afro as if it was a deadly weapon.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand and smiled. He did not try to go forward and only said softly.</p><p>“Old Senior Fang, I won’t make a move. I just want to ask you a question.”</p><p>Everyone’s curiosity was instantly piqued.</p><p>Now everyone knew that Greedy the Cat Spirit belonged to Xu Xiaoshou. What did he want to do if he did not plan to stop Fang Wenxin’s ‘evil act’?</p><p>“Don’t listen to him.”</p><p>Elder Yu reacted quickly and transmitted this telepathic communication to Fang Wenxin.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s words were even more terrifying than his attack.</p><p>Fang Wenxin hesitated for a moment, but he didn’t seal his six senses. He continued to suppress Greedy the Cat Spirit, but turned to look at the young man.</p><p>He didn’t really dislike Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>In fact, he even had a favorable impression of Mei Siren, Ye Xiaotian, and the others because they were only here to suppress the ghost beast.</p><p>“Speak.”</p><p>When he heard what Fang Wenxin said, Elder Yu sighed inwardly. He felt that the situation was hopeless, but he was powerless to stop it. He could only look back at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He was actually quite curious.</p><p>If he didn’t make a move, how could Xu Xiaoshou control Fang Wenxin’s heart? The determination of this first generation of the red-clothed people was absolutely resolute!</p><p>“Roar, roar, roar…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou ignored Greedy the Cat Spirit who howled in pain.</p><p>He swept his gaze over the tens of thousands of ghost beast souls summoned by the Blood Shadow copper coins.</p><p>This was the badge of honor of the first generation of the red-clothed people, Fang Wenxin. It represented his unparalleled battle achievements and the lives he had cut off!</p><p>They were dead.</p><p>But in a sense, they survived.</p><p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p><p>Lu Ke, one of the little red-clothed people, and Night Guardian, who was at the Cutting Path Stage but with the power of the Higher Void and Grand Vital Energy, flashed through his mind. There were also too many thoughts and questions that he had previously had in mind…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath and suppressed the waves in his heart. In front of the tens of millions of people in Jade Capital City, he raised his voice and said.</p><p>“Senior Fang, I’m only asking you!”</p><p>“On the path to redeem the ghost beast, if everyone leaves and their relatives and friends abandon them, and he can only shoulder the burden on his own,… Wouldn’t this person get tired?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
