With the same tone and emotion, she timidly called out, “Owner?”</p><p>…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s hair stood on end.</p><p>In his field of vision, the life pattern faded away. He saw the one who had pounced on him…</p><p>“A human?”</p><p>“A woman?”</p><p>She hugged him!</p><p>Those slender and rounded thighs, now pressed against her soft chest, skillfully nestled her entire body into his arms like a kitten.</p><p>The fluffy white tail raised high from her back, coiled around his waist like a snake, holding him tightly.</p><p>It was an unfamiliar face, but there was an inexplicable sense of familiarity…</p><p>Her pupils were vertical but would occasionally turn round. Within them, faint gray and red flowers swirled, though no power leaked out.</p><p>Three faint blood lines adorned her forehead. As her sharp nose approached, her wet tongue licked him affectionately!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>This wasn’t a human, this was a cat!</p><p>Blood lines, a white tail…</p><p>Traces of the Three Loathsome Eyes and the Three Tribulation Eyes…</p><p>This familiar intimacy and strange form of address, this most primitive way of closeness…</p><p>“Little Fat Cat?” Xu Xiaoshou called out in disbelief. He stretched out his hands but found them unable to touch the woman’s smooth back.</p><p>Why was this happening…</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>Something was wrong!</p><p>No! It seemed right.</p><p>Little Fat Cat was a female… But… Xu Xiaoshou wondered if it had transformed.</p><p>Ghost beast’s morph forms…</p><p>Yes! It made sense!</p><p>Caramel, Xin Gugu, Xuan Wuyi, Feng Yujin, no matter who it was, they all hey could all transform. Even Sovereign experts could transform.</p><p>But…</p><p>But, but…</p><p>Something was wrong with her!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou yanked the “person” off him. She was still licking something in a daze—Life force. This creature was still draining people’s Life force!</p><p>That fluffy, soft white tail, like a cat’s, seemed to have its own will. It stretched from behind to the front and curled around her waist.</p><p>“Speak!” Xu Xiaoshou commanded.</p><p>“Owner…”</p><p>“Ah! Shut up!”</p><p>“Meow…”</p><p>“You, you are the Greedy the Cat Spirit?”</p><p>“… Xu, Xiao Shou…”</p><p>When the “person” in his hands stuttered out his name with effort, Xu Xiaoshou realized something was wrong.</p><p>He took a deep breath and hesitated. However, he needed to confirm that the human-form Greedy the Cat Spirit still retained some beastly traits. He gently pushed her away…</p><p>…</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>A heart-wrenching scream suddenly pierced the sky above Jade Capital City.</p><p>Everyone looked up to see the Nine-Tailed Giant vanish from the ghostly energy vortex.</p><p>The surging ghostly energy in the sky receded like a retreating tide, quickly coalescing into a hazy human figure.</p><p>“Is it over?”</p><p>The fusion of the Nine-Tailed Giant could not be stopped by anyone.</p><p>When the Life Upanishad was completed, the Heaven and Earth phenomenon disappeared, and the ghostly energy vortex followed suit. Everyone realized that…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou and Greedy the Cat Spirit had likely completed their contract.</p><p>“Whoosh…”The wind began to stir.</p><p>The Life Dao Disc vanished, and so did the ghostly energy.</p><p>The blurry figure gradually solidified, and an irritated voice that sounded like it was talking to itself came from where it stood.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>“Meow…”</p><p>“Maybe I was wrong. Mo Mo misunderstood me. D*mn it!”</p><p>“Meow…”</p><p>“Can you speak human language now?”</p><p>“Meow…”</p><p>“Can you go out? Wait! I can’t go out yet. I need to find some clothes…”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>When the figure solidified, the murmuring stopped.</p><p>Everyone looked up to see an imposing figure in black robes standing in the sky. However, there was something different about him.</p><p>His shoes were torn, and sharp nails were poking out.</p><p>His pupils had turned vertical, with occasional grayish-red flashes of three flowers, hinting at hidden tribulation intent.</p><p>Three blood lines were now on his forehead, seeming to gather all the power that did not belong to him.</p><p>His hair was now the white of Greedy the Cat Spirit, and a white tail rose behind his waist. This tail, unconventional and seemingly self-aware, continuously changed its form.</p><p>“Ghost beast transformation…”</p><p>Fang Wenxin’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>The outcome he dreaded had finally come to pass.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit had been successfully contracted by Little Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“Senior Fang…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suppressed the triumphant voice in his mind as he turned his gaze back to the Saints in Jade Capital City.</p><p>He worked hard to maintain his composure, making the situation seem under control, and casually remarked, “Perhaps this is not what you wanted to see.”</p><p>“But in my current state, no one can stop me. The tribulations I will face in the future will come together… Meow!”</p><p>The corner of Little Xu Xiaoshou’s lips twitched. His eyes filled with horror, and his voice abruptly cut off.</p><p>“What’s that sound?”</p><p>The Saints on the city wall were still absorbed in Xu Xiaoshou’s defiant demeanor. They seemed to have heard something out of place but dared not confirm it.</p><p>“Heh.” Xu Xiaoshou chuckled lightly, choosing to ignore it.</p><p>No one could have imagined that the illusory meow was coming from his mouth.</p><p>He continued, “You should rest. The First Pavilion in the Sky welcomes you.”</p><p>“From now on, I will bear the tribulations of the ghost beast transformation… Meow!”</p><p>The world went silent.</p><p>Jade Capital City erupted into confusion, with Spiritual Cultivators in the city looking bewildered.</p><p>The Saints on the city wall had strange expressions. It didn’t seem like they were hallucinating.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen stared at Xu Xiaoshou, who had transformed into a ghost beast, her gaze fixed on the tail behind him. Suddenly, her lips curled up, and she nearly laughed out loud.</p><p>“After this calamity, I will… Meow!” Xu Xiaoshou’s expression froze.</p><p>The voice in his mind had come out. No, it was “we”!</p><p>“After this, we will bear the tribulation… Meow!” Xu Xiaoshou’s face went pale as he wiped his sweat.</p><p>Wrong, the order was wrong!</p><p>“From now on… Meow, meow, meow!”</p><p>“Meow, meow, meow. The owner understood. So happy!”</p><p>“Surprise. Passive Points: +9999.”</p><p>“Favor. Passive Points: +9999.”</p><p>“Conjecture. Passive Points: +9999.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was furious. He raised his hands, and the ghostly energy around him surged skyward. Facing the distant Sacred Mountain, he shouted, “Dao Xuan, meow. Come out and accept meow!”</p><p>“Ah, shut up!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
