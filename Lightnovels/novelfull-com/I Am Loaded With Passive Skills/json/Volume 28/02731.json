It was as if it had swept from the Eastern Region of the miniature version of the Shengshen Continent to the Western Region, but it could never come out again.</p><p>“That’s about it.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian chuckled.</p><p>The Spatial Upanishad, how could an ordinary demi-saint have any inkling of the depths of its power?</p><p>There was no need to have any additional defense as long as he was still here and could move.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou and Elder Yu would definitely not be able to harm the people of Jade Capital City!</p><p>“Oh…”</p><p>At that moment, Ye Xiaotian caught sight of Yu Zhiwen, who controlled the Xuanji great array beneath his feet from the corner of his eye. She trembled and groaned in pain and was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Her face was deathly pale and even the Kun Peng Saint Statue behind her was on the verge of shattering.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>With a sweep of his saint’s will, a portion of the energy passed through his Outer World, bypassed the Xuanji great array and entered Jade Capital City!</p><p>As for Yu Zhiwen, she had been on high alert and was the first to sense it. She used the Xuanji great array to restrain the huge force and endured it alone!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian shuddered in fright.</p><p>He could withstand the attacks of the Nine-Tailed Giant and the Kun Peng God, but even if Yu Zhiwen drank the Holy blood or opened the Holy Blood, how could she withstand even a tiny bit of the impact?</p><p>She wasn’t even a demi-saint!</p><p>“Don’t mess around…”</p><p>“World in the Palm!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian placed his hand above his head.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen, who had taken a great risk felt her control over the Xuanji great array disappear.</p><p>Her starry pupils trembled as she opened her eyes and looked over. She was shocked to see that the original location of Jade Capital City, the city walls, the tall buildings, the crowd, the osmanthus apricots…</p><p>Everything had disappeared!</p><p>The ground below the city was still there, but Jade Capital City that was rooted in the land had completely disappeared!</p><p>When she looked up…</p><p>There in Ye Xiaotian’s palm, which was raised high above his head, was a miniature version of Jade Capital City, that was filled with panic-stricken people!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen didn’t even have time to think. Without the protection of the Xuanji great array, she should have been attacked by the gray mass.</p><p>Suddenly, the world became incomparably huge!</p><p>Mei Siren, Zhong Yuanzi, and even Ye Xiaotian had become as tall and imposing as giants!</p><p>“This is?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen sudden realized something. She had also entered Ye Xiaotian’s World in the Palm and was under his protection.</p><p>The people in Jade Capital City who were also protected were very shocked.</p><p>“Oh my God!”</p><p>“How did Demi-Saint Ye get so big?”</p><p>“Why do I feel like I’m no longer in Jade Capital City… No, look below!”</p><p>It was as if the people on the ground had suddenly been teleported to a castle in the air.</p><p>When the people in the city swept their spiritual senses downwards, they only saw the originally disintegrated land of Jade Capital City that had been swept away by the gray mass.</p><p>And they were unharmed!</p><p>All of this was because they were nestled safely in Ye Xiaotian’s World in the Palm, that was like a stroke of genius!</p><p>The reality was…</p><p>The sky fell and the short man held it up?</p><p>Be it Mei Siren, Zhong Yuanzi, or Fang Wenxin, their perception of Ye Xiaotian changed and they saw him in a new light.</p><p>In their impression, wherever this fellow went, he would be beaten up.</p><p>When he was on Abyss Island, he received a semi-saint person. He didn’t even dare to try his luck and just ran away.</p><p>He had undergone sanctification in the Central Yuan world and had just received the Spatial Upanishad demi-saint title. Then he was chased away by Wangze Holy Emperor. He had escaped from the spatial fragment and sought refuge at the Shengxuan Gate of the Holy Palace.</p><p>Then, he had just arrived at Jade Capital City and was caught by the Xuanji great array and could not use any of his skills.</p><p>It was as if this Spatial Upanishad was a fake.</p><p>Compared to Water Ghost who was a Upanishad demi-saint, he could not even match a speck of the latter’s brilliance!</p><p>But at this moment…</p><p>It was only at this moment that the Saints realized that it was not that Ye Xiaotian was not strong, but that his fate was too tragic.</p><p>With just this single palm that held Jade Capital City, who knew how vast his Holy Power reserves were!</p><p>His use of the Way of Space was far superior to that of any other Spiritual Cultivators’ understanding of their respective attributes!</p><p>Ye Xiaotian, who was the center of attention, was in high spirits at this moment. Wasn’t this the exact reason why he had cultivated to this point?</p><p>He felt that he needed to say something.</p><p>The image of Xu Xiaoshou’s rebelliousness flashed across Ye Xiaotian’s mind, and his expression returned to its usual state. He said calmly.</p><p>“Even if you Dao Xuanji is like a feral dog that bites, I, Ye Xiaotian, will still hold Jade Capital City in my hands and save people from fire and water. It’s all because the demi-saint has compassion for the world.”</p><p>After he said that.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian lowered his hand down gently.</p><p>The toy-like Jade Capital City was returned to the shattered land by the demi-saint’s power and reverted to its previous size.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>Jade Capital City was in an uproar.</p><p>This was the first time in their lives that they had experienced going to another world!</p><p>“Demi-saint Ye is mighty!”</p><p>“Thank you, demi-saint Xiaotian, for saving my life!”</p><p>“Spatial Upanishad, World In the Palm… How terrifying!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s lips curled up in a smile, but he quickly suppressed it and stood there proudly.</p><p>He suddenly understood what Xu Xiaoshou had tried to do all this while.</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>Beibei came down from the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe with a letter of invitation in her hand.</p><p>When she barged into the battlefield without permission, she encountered a violent storm. Then she avoided the front, but could not see Jade Capital City.</p><p>Beibei’s first thought was that she had come to the wrong place.</p><p>Was this the Central Region?</p><p>Was there such a desolate place in the Central Region?</p><p>Even the mountains were gone, and the world was in a mess. The Land of Sin in the Southern Region had never committed such a great crime or suffered such a great punishment from Heaven!</p><p>Suddenly…</p><p>Jade Capital City was back!</p><p>It was released from the Spatial Upanishad Ye Xiaotian’s palm and returned without a scratch!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
