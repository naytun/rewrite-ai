No matter what method he uses, if he still can’t get Ai Cangsheng to return, then he himself need not come back too.”</p><p>“The Jiang Clan from Pu Xuan will be wiped out from the continent in one day!”</p><p>The sound waves in the Saint Hall surged and echoed around the beams.</p><p>The boy kowtowed repeatedly and hastily agreed.</p><p>“Go then.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Only then did the boy feel relieved. He stood up and took three steps back before he turned around.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>The boy’s body stiffened when he heard this. He turned his head back with difficulty. “Is there anything else, Hallmaster Xuanji?”</p><p>“Are you the one who serves Ai Cangsheng?”</p><p>“Yes, Hallmaster Xuanji.”</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s eyes flashed with killing intent, but it eventually disappeared. She said calmly, “When Ai Cangsheng is back, tell him everything that happened just now.”</p><p>“This subordinate does not dare!” The boy was so frightened that he fell to the ground.</p><p>“It is a command!”</p><p>“… Yes.”</p><p>Dao Xuanji leaned forward and pondered for a long time before she spoke softly. “In your opinion, can Ai Cangsheng defeat Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>What?</p><p>In my opinion?</p><p>The boy’s eyes widened as he raised his head and he was utterly shocked. Hallmaster asked for my opinion?</p><p>I’m just an attendant. I can’t even be compared to the guardians of the mountain. I’m not even at the lowest level of the white and red-clothed people…</p><p>If she did not ask the Council of Ten, how could she ask a mere attendant?</p><p>However, Dao Xuanji seemed to be serious. After she asked, she waited calmly.</p><p>The small boy felt helpless and could only rack his brains to find an answer. He said cautiously.</p><p>“He definitely can.”</p><p>“Lord Cangsheng was one of the Ten High Nobles a few decades ago. I have served him for many years and have a certain understanding of his strength.”</p><p>“He can keep watch over The Divine, who was also one of the Ten High Nobles, and monitor the five regions at the same time. He has remarkable abilities.”</p><p>“As long as Lord Cangsheng returns, he will definitely be able to turn the tide. He will kill the Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou and the others or imprison them in the Dead Sea.”</p><p>Dao Xuanji took a deep breath and quelled her panic. She knew that it had been totally inappropriate to ask the boy that question.</p><p>She stopped talking.</p><p>The two defeats gave her a clear picture.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was indeed detestable, but his words were not wrong.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had the bearing of the Ten High Nobles, so he could only be beaten by one of the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>She had just taken up her position as a Divine Sorceress and her foundation was not stable. She also did not have complete control over the Xuanji great array, so it was normal for her to fail.</p><p>“Victory and defeat are common in the military…”</p><p>Dao Xuanji reined in her emotions as she looked out of the hall.</p><p>She would not go out again and would only plan her strategies in this hall.</p><p>Even if Jade Capital City was destroyed, Xu Xiaoshou could still be held off for many days with the help of the mountain’s great array if he wanted to attack the Sacred Mountain.</p><p>As for the tens of millions of people in Jade Capital City…</p><p>Ten Jade Capital Cities could not raise a Saint, so naturally, they couldn’t produce even a demi-saint incarnation.</p><p>One could tell at a glance which was more important.</p><p>Dao Xuanji was truly afraid now.</p><p>If she were to die again, she could only use her real body and fight openly.</p><p>However, as the Hallmaster, she had to face more than just Xu Xiaoshou. There were many unknown difficulties.</p><p>Apart from this, Bazhun’an, whom Dao Qiongcang regarded as his mortal enemy and treated with extreme caution had not shown up even once nor made a single move!</p><p>“You may leave.”</p><p>Dao Xuanji tapped her fingers on the armrest and regained her composure. She said indifferently.</p><p>“Notify Beibei and tell her, Gu Yu, and Li Fuyu to make preparations. We should drag out the situation in Jade Capital City for as long as we can.”</p><p>“I will take action at the critical moment.”</p><p>The boy went out with the order.</p><p>Outside the door, three or five boys of similar height and appearance immediately came closer. After they were far away from the Saint Hall, they asked.</p><p>“How was it?”</p><p>The boy shivered and did not dare to speak. He only looked up into the distance, and felt as if the sky was about to collapse.</p><p>When Hallmaster Dao held the reins then, who on the Sacred Mountain had been so terrified for decades?</p><p>He created an illusion.</p><p>It was as if there were demi-saints everywhere on the Sacred Mountain, and each of them were as talented as the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>Those whose cultivation levels were not high enough had the potential to reach the level of the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>No matter how chaotic the various dark forces on the continent were, Hallmaster Dao merely raised his flag and sent out his troops. Then the problem was solved.</p><p>At that time, the Council of Ten did not even need to take much action.</p><p>Other than the battle at Sky City, the people who came out of the Sacred Mountain were the higher void and the Chief of the six divisions.</p><p>Now that Hallmaster Dao had left…</p><p>The boy suddenly realized that even the Chief of the six divisions had also become weaker!</p><p>It turned out that on the Sacred Mountain, the only one who had the title of the Ten High Nobles, the appearance, and the reality was Lord Ai Cangsheng!</p><p>If Hallmaster Xuanji was unable to continue…</p><p>At that time, Lord Cangsheng’s main job was not only to keep an eye on The Divine.</p><p>He would have to fight against all the demons and monsters in the five domains of the continent by himself.</p><p>And these ‘demons and monsters’ were not even ‘shrimp soldiers and crab generals’ in the past. Why would they make people feel so afraid now?</p><p>When he thought of this, the boy burst into tears and prayed silently.</p><p>‘Lord Cangsheng, please return quickly. The Sacred Mountain might no longer exist otherwise…’</p><p>“Beep.”</p><p>He put down the communication bead.</p><p>Beibei’s face was as ugly as that of a dead pig.</p><p>“Me?”</p><p>“Can the three of us really work together to bring Xu Xiaoshou down from his lofty position?”</p><p>Dao Xuanji had been killed twice, and Xu Xiaoshou’s force had already been established. Now, whoever went up would die. How could they take him down?</p><p>They had agreed that all the Saints would capture him together…</p><p>Due to the fact that Jade Capital City was beneath their feet, they were unable to launch a full-scale Saint war.</p><p>Since the Saint Servants still had Ye Xiaotian and Mei Siren on their side, Elder Fang, Elder Zhong, and Elder Yu were unable to go all out.</p><p>Furthermore, Xu Xiaoshou himself was not an ancient swordsman. He could fight against many demi-saints on his own; there was no such ancient swordsman who was so powerful!</p><p>She complained endlessly in her heart, but she still had to keep up the pretense.</p><p>There had never been a moment in her life when Beibei felt that the position of the Ruler of the white-clothed people was a hot seat.</p><p>However, she forced herself to turn around and calmly glanced at Gu Yu and Li Fuyu beside her. She deliberated and said.</p><p>“Both of you, Hallmaster Xuanji has a plan. First, let him win two rounds. One to boost his ego and the other to let him become arrogant.”</p><p>“As the old saying goes, pride will lead to defeat. Right now Xu Xiaoshou’s momentum is flourishing, however…”</p><p>“However, this is also a sign of being too hard and easily broken! His sword is about to break.”</p><p>Even Beibei herself did not sound very confident when she said this.</p><p>Gu Yu looked over and thought to himself, ‘Little lass, do you think you can fool this the old man?’</p><p>“Before his sword breaks, I want to ask, isn’t he a little too tough?” Gu Yu looked into the distance and pondered.</p><p>“Yes, a little…”</p><p>Beibei nodded in agreement. She then quickly reacted and said.</p><p>“But only a little.”</p><p>“There’s an ancient saying, ‘Once, twice, never a third time’. His power has reached its limit. Hallmaster Xuanji had already figured out his background.”</p><p>“If we battle him now, this would be a great opportunity to dampen his momentum and destroy his might!”</p><p>Gu Yu said, “If the ancient sayings are so powerful, you should let them challenge him instead of me.”</p><p>“No, please!”</p><p>Beibei panicked. She could tell that Elder Gu was about to retreat.</p><p>If the two ladies were to challenge Xu Xiaoshou, would they be able to return?</p><p>“Elder Gu, please listen to me. That Xu Xiaoshou is a mere…”</p><p>“Who called my name?!”</p><p>Suddenly, a loud roar came from afar.</p><p>Beibei’s cheeks quivered in fear and she stumbled on a pile of dirt and almost rolled down the hill.</p><p>At a certain moment, she even felt Xu Xiaoshou was already a demi-saint. It was disrespectful to call him by his real name!</p><p>That’s not right…</p><p>He was only at the Sovereign Dao Realm, how could he have such a sensitive reaction to his name?</p><p>“I did!”</p><p>Beibei slapped her sword case and took the lead to grab the Supreme Emperor Sword. Then, she stood up and replied in a neither servile nor overbearing manner.</p><p>Since she had already been discovered, there was no point to stay hidden.</p><p>The ancient swordsman will press forward with an indomitable will!</p><p>She muttered a few words and flew forward without a backward glance.</p><p>“Both of you.”</p><p>“I’ll go and meet that fellow first.”</p><p>“After we find out the truth, I hope that Elder Gu and Miss Li will not forget their promise and fight with Xu Xiaoshou again.”</p><p>“Of course…”</p><p>Beibei paused for a moment and had a proud look on her face. “Who knows, you might not need to do it.”</p><p>Little lass!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost laughed when he saw the small person from the white-clothed people fly over.</p><p>Of course he knew who Beibei was.</p><p>He had met her before at the Black Water Stream in the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>At that time, he wasn’t confident that he could take down this new Sword Deity in a short time, so Feng Yujin sealed her off with one strike.</p><p>However, the combat strength of an ancient Swordsman was obvious to all.</p><p>When the Explosive Bounded Domain exploded, Xu Xiaoshou had deliberately asked his second true body to pay some attention to the girl, after he had captured her.</p><p>This was why he could sense it when the other party called out his name.</p><p>Since the three great ancient swordsman were already in Jade Capital City, they couldn’t possibly just be here to watch the show, right?</p><p>But things were different now!</p><p>After the ghost beast transformation and Dao Xuanji being defeated twice, Beibei still dared to stand out…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had a high regard for her.</p><p>“You want to fight with me?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
