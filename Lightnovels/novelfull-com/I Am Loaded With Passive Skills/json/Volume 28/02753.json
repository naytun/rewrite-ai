The ones remaining were the real big shots.</p><p>Gou Wuyue, Dao Qiongcang, and Bazhun’an—counting carefully, three of the Ten High Nobles were here.</p><p>Along with the renowned teahouse Storyteller and the Three Emperors, Wei Feng.</p><p>No one knew where this drama would lead, but one thing was certain…</p><p>“The Divine Sect is quite impressive!”</p><p>…</p><p>Bazhun’an watched Lei Shuangxing depart and then turned back around.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang met his gaze, facing this friend.</p><p>The War of the Ten High Nobles felt like it was just yesterday…</p><p>The battle at Abyss Island was still fresh in his memory…</p><p>Over the years, endless bloody storms, both public and secret, had never ceased.</p><p>The former supreme leader of the Holy Divine Palace had encountered the dominant figure of the dark power, the first-in-command saint servant, in the Southern Region’s Land of Sin. Yet, this was the first time they had met outside of battle.</p><p>Behind them were the resentful gazes of the Storyteller and Gou Wuyue.</p><p>God of Killing Wei Feng looked around, realized he had no stake in this, and took the lead in sitting down.</p><p>In the small Riches Inn, under the combined scrutiny of these figures, it seemed like a flood that could swallow the five regions was brewing.</p><p>Just as everyone thought it was time for things to get tense…</p><p>The few people present exchanged smiles.</p><p>“Sit!” Dao Qiongcang pointed to the tea table where Wei Feng had taken a seat. There were still a few empty spots.</p><p>“No, no, no. Hallmaster Dao, please go ahead.” Bazhun’an also gestured.</p><p>“Don’t, don’t, don’t. I’m already a former Hallmaster, and you’re still the first-in-command saint servant,” Dao Qiongcang said with a wry smile.</p><p>“Oh? Is that so? Then…” Bazhun’an turned to Gou Wuyue. “Moonless Sword Deity should take a seat first!”</p><p>Gou Wuyue twitched at the corner of his mouth, unable to tolerate the hypocrisy. He glanced at the Storyteller and said solemnly, “I chased from the Central Region to the Eastern Region, from Azure Dragon Prefecture to the Eighth Palace…”</p><p>“I didn’t expect to find you in the Southern Region.”</p><p>The Storyteller, Ning Honghong, covered her mouth and chuckled, then gracefully sat down beside them.</p><p>With a sweet smile, she said, “Brother Moonless is no longer the white-clothed Ruler. Please don’t take me to Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe and hand me to those bad people. I’m terrified!”</p><p>After a moment, her gaze fell on Gou Wuyue’s severed arm, and she exclaimed, “Oh! What’s this? How did a Sword Deity lose an arm?”</p><p>“D*mn it!” Wei Feng couldn’t hold back any longer. He slammed the table and stood up. “Can you speak properly?!”</p><p>The Storyteller shot a mischievous glance, her long legs nearly touching Wei Feng’s chest as she looked around dismissively.</p><p>“Hmm? Who’s talking? I don’t see anyone.”</p><p>Wei Feng’s killing intent flared. He drew Yama’s Banquet and prepared to strike.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang quickly intervened. “It’s all in the past. Since we’re all gathered here today, let’s set aside past grievances and discuss the future. How about that?”</p><p>“Oh? The faithful lackey of the Holy Divine Palace is finally about to face the darkness?” The Storyteller smiled.</p><p>“Impudent!” Wei Feng glared coldly and tightened his grip on his weapon.</p><p>“Good weapon,” Bazhun’an remarked, and with a hum, Yama’s Banquet trembled violently, emitting silver-white sword cognition.</p><p>“Swords are swords, sabers are sabers. Since the sword has been sealed here, do you want to break through?” Gou Wuyue’s gaze sharpened, and The Voice of Nulan was unsheathed with a clang.</p><p>“Heh, my sword,” Bazhun’an replied, and the Demon Sword quivered, preparing to fly over.</p><p>“No, it’s my sword!” Gou Wuyue’s Sword Will surged, green light overflowing from The Voice of Nulan, shattering the silver-white sword sense.</p><p>“A breakthrough?” Bazhun’an’s eyes lit up as he looked at Gou Wuyue. “Did Hua Changdeng provoke you?”</p><p>“It’s not just me. I’m afraid you can’t hold it in anymore, right?”</p><p>“No, no…”</p><p>“Bazhun’an, it’s better to meet in person than hear about you. Today, I’ll test you on behalf of Elder Yan!”</p><p>“Why is this short fellow so irritable?”</p><p>“Enough! Speak properly to me!”</p><p>“What if I don’t want?”</p><p>“Then die…”</p><p>The Riches Inn was filled with murderous intent.</p><p>Suddenly, another sword cognition exploded, sweeping in all directions.</p><p>Then thousands of green Mo Swords flew out, forming the Green River Sword Boardline.</p><p>However, all of this was instantly compressed and condensed into the Yin-Yang Book of Life and Death…</p><p>The people outside were so shocked.</p><p>“D*mn… Is it all real?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang could no longer endure the chaos. His Holy Power erupted, and the entire Riches Inn shattered into pieces.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>“We’re here to discuss cooperation!”</p><p>“Give me some respect!”</p><p>“Bazhun’an, give me some respect!”</p><p>Before Bazhun’an could respond, Dao Qiongcang broke the silence and mused, “Oh, so this is what it feels like to talk like that?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
