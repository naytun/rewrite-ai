He had to handle the affairs of the Sacred Mountain and also the Heavenly Group’s operations.</p><p>In short, he didn’t meet Gu Yu immediately.</p><p>When Gu Yu asked to see him for the second time, the Sacred Mountain just happened to have a change in leadership.</p><p>The one he met was Dao Xuanji. After they discussed this matter, he became a member of the audience and witnessed how Dao Xuanji achieved the position of Hallmaster.</p><p>To be able to come to the Sacred Mountain and enter the Saint Hall, his background had naturally been investigated into. It was extremely clean.</p><p>Gu Yu wasn’t in cahoots with Dao Qiongcang, this was very important!</p><p>Dao Xuanji really wanted this person to stay.</p><p>A semi-saint person was not enough to express her sincerity.</p><p>Look at You Tu, Mei Siren, and the others, there were very few ancient swordsmen. Among those who became famous, which one was just an ordinary person?</p><p>These swords were too useful!</p><p>The Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe had cultivated for so many years, but only Hua Changdeng had been nurtured among their own people.</p><p>The rest, including Rao Yaoyao, either died prematurely, or like Beibei, Xi, and the others were too far off. They couldn’t even be compared to the likes of Xiao Kongtong during this era.</p><p>If Gu Yu could join the Holy Divine Palace…</p><p>“If Elder Gu were to take a seat here, the Saint Hall will have another pillar!”</p><p>Dao Xuanji stretched out her hand as she pointed. In front of everyone, she was not stingy with her praise.</p><p>Elder Gu closed his eyes and let out a long sigh. How could he not understand what she meant?</p><p>He immediately stood up and bowed. He apologized sincerely.</p><p>“I’m indebted to Hallmaster Xuanji’s favor, but I’m used to wandering around the world.”</p><p>“The Saint Hall is a grand hall. To me, it is too high above the clouds and beyond my reach.”</p><p>“It had been an honor to enter the hall today. I had no other presumptuous thoughts. If I were to live here for a long time, I’m afraid I will break the rules of this hall because I’m used to being free.”</p><p>He shook his head vigorously. He thought for a while and said. “I don’t dare. I really don’t dare. I don’t deserve it. I am not worthy of this position.”</p><p>Beibei’s short legs dangled over the seat. She blinked and looked at Hallmaster Xuanji.</p><p>The conversation between these two people was rather interesting.</p><p>“Rules?” Dao Xuanji gestured for Elder Gu to sit down. There was no need for such formality.</p><p>“During Dao Qiongcang’s term, the rules were too strict.”</p><p>“Under my reign, everyone in the Saint Hall is equal, there are no rules!”</p><p>“If Elder Gu is afraid he would suffer the same fate as Gou Wuyue, I can guarantee you that this will never happen again.”</p><p>“If Elder Gu stays in the Sacred Mountain, you can come and go freely. You also have the right to receive a one time exemption. Even if you really commit a major offense, I will allow you to leave the Sacred Mountain and let bygones be bygones.”</p><p>“Words are not enough. This is an oath!”</p><p>As Dao Xuanji spoke, she took out the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree and wanted to rip it open on the spot.</p><p>Wow!</p><p>This was not ‘somewhat interesting’.</p><p>It was very interesting, very interesting indeed!</p><p>Beibei turned around and took out some melon seeds from her pocket. She was about to nibble on them, but decided against it. She looked at Elder Gu.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“You mustn’t!”</p><p>Gu Yu raised his hand and was so agitated that he even used his Sword Will to suppress the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree in Dao Xuanji’s hand.</p><p>“This old man has committed many sins!”</p><p>“But Hallmaster Xuanji, you can’t break the rules of the Sacred Mountain all because of a certain Gu.”</p><p>“If that’s the case, then I will be a sinner in the Holy Divine Palace. Hallmaster Xuanji is trying to put me in an unjust position!”</p><p>Siren, what should I do…</p><p>Back then, did you also encounter this?</p><p>Gu Yu stood up and pushed the chair back and said apologetically,</p><p>“Actually, I don’t have full confidence to deal with Xu Xiaoshou. I can only repay Hallmaster Xuanji’s kindness one day.”</p><p>He looked out of the hall and sighed that this path would not work. He cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“I will take my leave now. We will meet again if fate permits.”</p><p>What?</p><p>He wanted to leave?</p><p>How should she deal with this?</p><p>Beibei then turned to look at Hallmaster Xuanji, her eyes filled with eagerness and anticipation.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>Dao Xuanji extended her hand to stop him. “If Elder Gu really left due to my neglect, who in the world would dare to enter the Saint Hall in the future? Please stay!”</p><p>Gu Yu stopped in his tracks and could only bow and turn around. “Hallmaster Xuanji has already treated me well. How can she be said to be negligent…”</p><p>He paused.</p><p>Because Dao Xuanji had suddenly taken out a glass-like crystal gem from her spatial ring. It emitted a faint Saint light and looked magnificent.</p><p>“A semi-saint person…”</p><p>Beibei was stunned and sat there with her mouth agape.</p><p>Did she really need to go to the extent to take out the semi-saint person? He had not even fought with Xu Xiaoshou yet!</p><p>Dao Xuanji walked over with the crystal gem and personally handed it to Gu Yu. She said in a subtle manner.</p><p>“I was too eager to recruit new talents and forgot that Elder Gu was used to freedom. That was my mistake.”</p><p>“You said that you don’t have full confidence to fight Xu Xiaoshou. Now that I’ve given you the semi-saint person, do you have the confidence?”</p><p>That was just my excuse!</p><p>How could anyone in this world be so thorough? I haven’t even joined the Holy Divine Palace and my path of retreat was already sealed?</p><p>But…</p><p>But…</p><p>Gu Yu looked at the stuff of his dreams in her hand. His eyes were dull and he fell into a daze and his breath became heavier.</p><p>Soon, the corners of his eyes trembled and he regained his senses. He quickly handed the hot potato back.</p><p>Beibei cupped her chin with her hands and rested them on the table.</p><p>What would he do?</p><p>Anyway, if it were me, I wouldn’t be able to handle Hallmaster Xuanji…</p><p>Soon, she saw Elder Gu’s fear and trepidation. He spoke in a trembling voice.</p><p>“I haven’t made any contributions, how can I obtain this status?”</p><p>“Apart from the fact that this is against the rules, even I feel guilty and would not sleep well at night!”</p><p>He returned the semi-saint person.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
