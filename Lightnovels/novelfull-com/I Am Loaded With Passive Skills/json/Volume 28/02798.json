Absolutely impossible! This must be an illusion sword technique, or my eyes are deceiving me…”</p><p>“Feng Zhongzui, speak up!”</p><p>After all, separated by a Dao Imparting Mirror, no matter how real it looked, it couldn’t compare to seeing it directly on the battlefield.</p><p>Although many ancient swordsmen had their reservations about Feng Zhongzui, 99% would candidly admit that their knowledge fell short of his.</p><p>Not understanding what they saw, everyone screamed out; some even shook the mirror-holder of the Feng family, urging them to send messages faster, calling someone to explain.</p><p>The eagerly awaited Feng Zhongzui was stunned for a moment, then rattled off:</p><p>“Brothers, I know you are anxious; don’t rush it, and you’re panicking; don’t panic… I’m even more anxious! More panicked! I need to verify this first…”</p><p>“Heaven! What am I seeing? The visualization of the Holy Emperor’s will? Lord Shou is playing with conceptual stuff, he’s a Conceptual God!”</p><p>“If Heart Sword Technique, the imagery of God of Sword, Gu Louying, is an illusion that can be guarded against, or dismissed if one is as indifferent as I am, without being controlled, this time it’s different!”</p><p>“You’re not mistaken; this is Lord Shou’s Heart Sword Technique second-rank Heavenly Unravel! And this visualization of his imagery is truly the Holy Emperor’s power, capable of physical attacks!”</p><p>“But how is that possible? Heart Sword Technique capable of physical attacks? No! It’s possible… with the powers of space and time! Lord Shou’s sword, it’s not just the Heart Sword Technique second-rank Heavenly Unravel; he has also used a Space-Time Transition!”</p><p>“An imperceptible Space-Time Transition, I was even fooled—I’m certain Lord Shou has bypassed the true existing powers of the four Holy Emperors, and he momentarily transported the power of the Four Saints, which he received in the past, to the present!”</p><p>“Which means…”</p><p>The more Feng Zhongzui spoke, the more terrified he became, the more he thought his claims were preposterous.</p><p>He didn’t even dare to look at the family head, only daring to look at Master Siren, and received encouraging eyes from him.</p><p>Then, he almost went berserk on the spot, hysterically ranting:</p><p>“Which means!”</p><p>“If Lord Shou’s sword, in the state of Fierce Sword Heavenly Unravel, can achieve a second-rank Heavenly Unravel Demons Under Eyes and, with a Space-Time Transition, temporarily transfer the power from the past back to the present…”</p><p>“With such a method that turns decay into magic, such a grasp of turning the false into reality, Lord Shou must have brushed the threshold of the Second World!”</p><p>“Isn’t he using the Second World?”</p><p>“Is he holding back?”</p><p>“Is this his full strength?”</p><p>“Brothers, I’m going crazy! The Sword Deity Bei isn’t fighting a Sword Immortal; she’s contending with a peerless freak, a Conceptual God!!!”</p><p>The ancient swordsmen of the Burial Sword Tomb exploded.</p><p>The spectators of the Eighth Palace were shocked.</p><p>The mass of evil cultivators at Half-Moon Bay were clutching their heads in a daze of madness.</p><p>Gu Qingyi, Xiao Wanfeng, Xiao Qixiu, and Elder Wuyue stood up.</p><p>In the distant Western Desert, where few watched the Dao Imparting Mirror, the swordsman Ah Lai, Elder You, and August stood up.</p><p>Atop Jade Capital City, Mei Siren was smiling like a flower, Feng Tingchen, Gu Yu, Yang Xizhi were dumbfounded with wide eyes, and Li Fuyu’s lips slightly parted, her eyes flashing with shock and amazement.</p><p>Bazhun’an got up from the big rock, turned, and left.</p><p>“Brother?” The storyteller was confused, hurriedly following.</p><p>“What are you doing!” Hallmaster Dao, who was engrossed, couldn’t help but glare at the back of the killjoy.</p><p>“No need to fight anymore,” Bazhun’an didn’t even turn his head, waving his hand with only four fingers, “You don’t need to see what he’s going to do next.”</p><p>Hallmaster Dao was stunned.</p><p>Going to do next?</p><p>…</p><p>“Sword Deity Bei?”</p><p>In the midst of battle, a booming voice filled with doubt came from the Ultimate Giant, which was momentarily endowed with the powers of the Four Holy Emperors through the Fourth Sword Heavenly Unravel.</p><p>The Sword Deity Bei was merely stunned for an instant, still not having grasped the meaning of Feng Zhongzui’s rapid-fire words. As those in the midst of it were even less capable and more challenged to understand Xu Xiaoshou’s sword tactic…</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>The Extremely Evil Ultimate Giant’s imagery stepped into the void and leaped from afar, its withered arms wrapping around the Heavenly Emperor Sword and yanking it out fiercely.</p><p>“Boom——”</p><p>The colors of the heaven and earth changed, mountains and rivers shattered.</p><p>With the Heavenly Emperor Sword in its grasp, the Ultimate Giant exuding a demonic aura wielded the sword as if it were a mere toy, slashing wildly in all directions…</p><p>“Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom…”</p><p>It even pierced through the spacetime turbulence!</p><p>Empress Beibei, merged within, experienced the collapse of her thoughts, knowing nothing as she felt her brain being thoroughly shaken.</p><p>The last clear image seen by her clarity of spiritual altar…</p><p>The Ultimate Giant grasped the tip of the Supreme Emperor Sword with one hand and the hilt with the other, and after infusing it with the power of the Four Divine Pillars, it heaved its knee up and then pressed down on the greatsword in its hands.</p><p>“Crack… Bang!!!”</p><p>At this moment, the eyes of the people in front of the Dao Imparting Mirror nearly popped out.</p><p>The Emperor Sword Heavenly Unravel was broken forcibly!</p><p>The Empress Beibei, merged within, was blasted out from an unknown height in the sky, her consciousness dim and eyes descending into darkness.</p><p>With a scoop of its palm, the Ultimate Giant dissipated the layers of vicious sword imagery, and the subsequent release of the Four Divine Pillars’ power gradually unwound…</p><p>It didn’t care.</p><p>It was over!</p><p>“Supreme Emperor Sword above all?”</p><p>No sooner had one crisis subsided than another arose.</p><p>The monstrous figure raised the unconscious little Beibei, who was powerless to resist, and with a threatening roar, hurled her towards the ground.</p><p>Its strength and speed were so intense and fast that they created a sonic boom:</p><p>“I decree that all swords under the heavens shall honor me above all. How dare you claim to be Emperor?!”</p><p>Mei Siren was so frightened that his Taicheng Sword trembled; he rushed ahead before Beibei was smashed into a pulp and dived to catch her.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“Lord Shou, stop! Such a prodigy deserves to live!”</p><p>Whoosh.</p><p>Dust sprayed all over the ground.</p><p>The hand of the Ultimate Giant’s imagery stopped a yard above the earth. The ground cracked with a snap, and the dust slowly spread outward.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>The sound of heated air dissipated.</p><p>The power borrowed for the Time-space Transition, released.</p><p>The Heavenly Unravel State of ‘Demons Under Eyes’ Rank Two, released.</p><p>The Fierce Sword Heavenly Unravel of the “Fourth Sword,” released.</p><p>As the dust filled the air, the wicked Lord Shou reverted to his harmless original self, Xu Xiaoshou, gently placing the small Beibei on the ground.</p><p>He bowed his head and brushed his hands, dusting off the scant dirt on his black clothes, then slowly turned around, calm and collected, full to the brim as if nothing had happened.</p><p>But that cold gaze swept across the many ancient swordsmen present, sending a slight chill down the backs of the sword-bearers…</p><p>How could this not be a declaration that the frenzied battle just now had truly occurred?</p><p>Finally, his gaze settled on the Dao Imparting Mirror, as if he saw the thousands of spectators from the five regions.</p><p>The killing intent on his face faded, and with a wicked smile on his lips, he lightly chuckled:</p><p>“Just kidding.”</p><p>Then he bared his teeth, emitting a cruel and bizarre imitative laugh:</p><p>“Heeheehee…”</p><p>…</p><p>In the five regions, in front of the Dao Imparting Mirror.</p><p>Utter silence.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
