He was indeed a bit weaker, but there’s something he said that holds…” Dao Qiongcang paused and flicked his long sleeves, transforming into a performer as he sang, “My flesh and blood are weak, Heaven’s secrets soars…”</p><p>People outside the door shivered and some left due to the unpleasantness of the voice. “D*mn it, that’s awful.”</p><p>“Are you serious?”</p><p>Lei Shuangxing could no longer stay calm and stood up.</p><p>If Dao Qiongcang wasn’t here because of the Struggle for the Great Path, it was very likely he had come to build a good relationship.</p><p>“Don’t you believe me?” Dao Qiongcang stopped acting and turned to Gou Wuyue, pinching his fingers.</p><p>Pop, pop, pop!</p><p>His fingertips moved swiftly, producing a dazzling golden light.</p><p>Finally, he pointed towards the distance, and the golden light soared towards the Jade Capital City in the Central Region.</p><p>“I’ll help you see your fortune again. You really shouldn’t be in the Southern Region, whether it’s for the Seven Sword Deity or another mission.”</p><p>“At this time, you should head to the Central Region and travel non-stop.”</p><p>“Otherwise…” Dao Qiongcang paused, drawing everyone’s curiosity, and then laughed.</p><p>“Heaven’s secrets must not be divulged.”</p><p>Riches Inn erupted again.</p><p>“D*mn it! I can’t take this!”</p><p>“Are you seriously setting this up? Still talking about Heaven’s secrets? If you reveal the heaven’s secret, I’ll reward you again!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang shook his head repeatedly, not swayed by the offer of five buckets of Spirit Crystals. “I said the Heaven’s secrets cannot be revealed. It just can’t.”</p><p>Everyone rolled up their sleeves.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang quickly changed his tune. “However, if you join my Divine Sect, I might reveal a little of Heaven’s secrets… achieving godhood is just around the corner.”</p><p>Everyone laughed again.</p><p>“Missionaries!”</p><p>“So they came to preach. I’m so angry. The Divine Sect has become quite flashy recently. Is this their way of spreading the word?”</p><p>“Not to mention, Dao Qiongcang is quite impressive. That was the genuine Finger Pinching Divination,’ right?”</p><p>“Successor of the Golden Technique Sect?”</p><p>“Who knows, who knows. My flesh and blood are weak, Heaven’s secrets reveal… Interesting…” Someone seemed intrigued.</p><p>“D*mn it! Don’t think I can’t see through you just because you’re close to me. Get lost!”</p><p>“Oh…”</p><p>The door was in chaos.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing’s spiritual senses swept over the two Saints and Sword Deity again, falling into deep thought.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang wouldn’t travel thousands of miles just to amuse himself…</p><p>But!</p><p>“But there must be a reason you’re here. Who are you waiting for? The Bazhun’an?” Dao Qiongcang suddenly spoke.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing seemed to snap out of it. “Mind reading?”</p><p>He even drew his Divine-beating Crutch, ready to act.</p><p>The Riches Inn trembled with shock. The Sword Will swept through everyone’s robes, flinging open the doors and windows.</p><p>Suddenly, Gou Wuyue stood up from the shadows. The sudden bleakness flowed like water before finally disappearing without a trace.</p><p>“Hmm?” The people in the inn were baffled, sensing that some danger had been erased.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>“That’s a mysterious feeling…”</p><p>“Yes! They have some skills. Two ancient swordsmen…”</p><p>“No!” Suddenly, someone exclaimed, “Isn’t Lei Shuangxing the real deal?”</p><p>This voice seemed to be trying to clear up some confusion. At that moment, an excited voice came from afar, “He’s here! So it’s a troupe!”</p><p>“The Bazhun’an and the Storyteller are here. These two have been quite active lately, traveling everywhere and even coming here!”</p><p>The crowd at Riches Inn parted as if pushed by a giant hand.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang, Wei Feng, and Gou Wuyue turned to look, and Lei Shuangxing adjusted his bamboo hat, focusing on the door.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The Divine-beating Crutch was suddenly agitated.</p><p>The Voice of Nulan buzzed as well.</p><p>The effect was truly spectacular. Just as everyone was marveling, a loud laugh rang out from the distance.</p><p>“Elder Dao the Flamboyant, you were sealed as a Hallmaster for thirty years. Now that you’re free, you’ve finally entered your prime?”</p><p>“I can smell your stench from thirty miles away. It’s even more distinctive than your Innate Sword Intent!”</p><p>The crowd erupted into chatter.</p><p>When the lifelike Bazhun’an and the vivid Storyteller walked into the inn, everyone was stunned.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing lowered his head and pulled out his Divine-beating Crutch.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s eyes gleamed as he smiled and awaited the guest from afar.</p><p>The one-armed Gou Wuyue held the Voice of Nulan in his hand. He was truly impressive. His expression was complex, surprised, unwilling, joyful, and contemplative…</p><p>He portrayed a former friend, a Sword Deity who had lost his arm in the Struggle for the Great Path and had returned a sword because of a past gift, with great skill.</p><p>Almost everyone in the inn applauded enthusiastically!</p><p>“So this is how you preach?”</p><p>“Good, good, good. The Divine Sect… I’ll remember this name. You guys are impressive.”</p><p>The Bazhun’an strode into the inn.</p><p>In front of Dao Qiongcang, he looked nothing like the sickly figure from before.</p><p>Smiling and nodding at his arch-enemy, he then turned to Lei Shuangxing and handed him a jade talisman.</p><p>“Put everything else aside for now.”</p><p>“Contact Xuan Wuji first, then head to the Central Region. No need for the great array. Remember to hurry.”</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang is right. Jade Capital City needs you now.”</p><p>Lei Shuangxing took the jade talisman in disbelief.</p><p>But since the Bazhun’an had said so, he had to believe that Dao Qiongcang was truly helping him… It felt like a dream!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
