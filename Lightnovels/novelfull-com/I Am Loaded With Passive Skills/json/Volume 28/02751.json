This pretty boy looks so high-class. I instantly understand what ‘graced by your graciousness’ means.”</p><p>“Wow, a cultured person. You even know the phrase ‘graced by your graciousness’?”</p><p>“Yeah, what do you think? You ignorant lout.”</p><p>“D*mn! Tell me honestly, what does that mean?”</p><p>“It means to help you get rich.”</p><p>“Oh, I see… Hehe, thanks for the blessing! Haha!”</p><p>At the table by the window, Lei Shuangxing was on high alert, unlike the mocking crowd outside.</p><p>He had never imagined encountering such righteous figures in a filthy place like the Southern Region!</p><p>His spiritual senses swept over Gou Wuyue and Wei Feng, finally settling on Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing spoke in a deep voice, “Dao Qiongcang!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang shook his head and laughed. Even the setting sun seemed to dim as he responded with gravity, “Lei Shuangxing!”</p><p>Outside the door, someone burst out laughing. He covered his mouth, sneering, and felt awkward.</p><p>“I can’t handle this anymore. They’re exchanging names so seriously. It feels like I’m watching an act by someone I know.”</p><p>“I feel the same…”</p><p>“Shut up. Maybe they’re just from a troupe. Just watch.”</p><p>“Hahaha, that’s true.”</p><p>The two at the square table remained unaffected.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was remarkably composed in the face of awkwardness and silence. Lei Shuangxing was the first to break the quiet, “What do you mean?”</p><p>These words reminded everyone of the earlier conversation. It was clear he was addressing the “no” and refuting the manager’s reasonable speculation.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang shrugged. “Nothing much. I read your fortune. You shouldn’t be in the Southern Region right now. Jade Capital City is more suitable for you.”</p><p>“You’re no longer Hallmaster Dao!” someone outside corrected him.</p><p>“Oh.” Dao Qiongcang turned around and waved with a smile. “You’re right, brother. I’m Saint now.”</p><p>The people in the Riches Inn burst into laughter once again.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing couldn’t manage a smile. He asked again, “What do you mean?”</p><p>“The gist is that the manager’s guess is indeed reasonable. I’d also share that view. Who knows, maybe after a few decades, Lord Shou might dig up the Lei family’s murder case for you. If you miss it, you won’t catch the good show,” Dao Qiongcang said indifferently.</p><p>“Seriously, Dao Qiongcang, you’re the elder brother of Hallmaster Xuanji. Which side are you on?” someone outside the door complained. They questioned how they could act if the alignment was off.</p><p>“Yeah, Saint Servants and the Holy Divine Palace are enemies. How could you two sit and chat? Get to fighting!”</p><p>“Well said, start the fight!”</p><p>The crowd began to jeer. Wei Feng could no longer tolerate it. He slammed his Yama’s Banquet on the ground and shouted, “Be quiet!”</p><p>The Riches Inn fell silent.</p><p>“There’s something to this God of Killing…”</p><p>“Don’t provoke him. He kills people.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang managed to turn back and joke, “I’ve been betrayed and am no longer the Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace. Why should I still be enemies with the Saint Servants?”</p><p>“Wouldn’t it make more sense to cooperate and storm the Sacred Mountain to reclaim my position?”</p><p>In the darkness, Gou Wuyue rubbed his forehead and closed his eyes.</p><p>He regretted coming along once again…</p><p>“That makes some sense.”</p><p>“Bro, you must have some understanding of Dao Qiongcang. Keep up the act! Perform well, and you’ll be rewarded!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang raised his voice, “Thank you in advance, bro.”</p><p>“Hahaha, reward!” A bag of Spirit Crystals was thrown in from outside.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing could hardly believe what was happening in the inn.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang bent down, picked up the bag of Spirit Crystals, and sat back in his chair. He poured himself a cup of tea to soothe his throat.</p><p>“You guys…” He was momentarily at a loss for words. “How did you find my location?”</p><p>“Is it believable if I say I was just passing by and happened to run into you?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang finished his tea in one gulp. He then put the cup down and tapped his fingers on the table. “Meeting is fate. I’m doing you a favor. It’s reasonable.”</p><p>“Lord Shou?” someone outside asked in surprise.</p><p>“Of course!” Dao Qiongcang cupped his fists in the direction of the Central Region Sacred Mountain and said passionately, “They said that I was the one who released the Greedy the Cat Spirit. Xu Xiaoshou is suffering right now!”</p><p>“I cherish my life greatly. I feared that Lord Shou would come with the Saint Servants to seek revenge. Once I figured there was a turning point here, I rushed over to form a good relationship.”</p><p>“It’s never too late to mend fences!”</p><p>This line was masterfully delivered.</p><p>The people inside and outside the door couldn’t help but get into the plot, feeling transported to the distant Jade Capital City. The Dao Qiongcang before them seemed all too real.</p><p>“Your troupe is pretty impressive. What’s it called? I’ll come to support you later!” someone shouted.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang quickly stood up, cupped his fists, and bowed, “We are from the Divine Sect.”</p><p>Wei Feng turned his head away upon hearing this.</p><p>Gou Wuyue buried his head in the shadows, too embarrassed to face anyone.</p><p>“Divine Sect?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
