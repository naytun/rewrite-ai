This latter method sacrifices a great deal of straightforward offensive attributes.</p><p>But at the same time, it added a smidge of trickery to its capabilities.</p><p>Interestingly, Xu Xiaoji/Xu Xiaoshou, who are both inclined towards trickery, had the same simple thought without prior agreement:</p><p>“Just like the Fourth Sword contaminates a regular Spiritual Cultivator, from the inside out, break through the Heavenly Unravel imagery of the Supreme Emperor Sword by contamination!”</p><p>With such a cunning plan, how could Beibei, who had already been hit, not realize it?</p><p>However, in an instant, just as the Supreme Emperor Sword was about to be entirely dyed black, Beibei lived up to the name of Sword Deity and made a decisive call:</p><p>“The devil is heavy desire, desire originates from the Secular Sword;”</p><p>“The Secular Sword is an attribute, the attribute returns to the compassionate heart;”</p><p>“The compassionate heart is void of self, self is devoid of those devilish desires!”</p><p>This string of nested reactions was undeniably swift and seamlessly connected.</p><p>The ancient swordsman watching in front of the Dao Imparting Mirror was utterly fascinated, for above the Supreme Emperor Sword, the auras of the three major realms of the Red Dust Sword, the Present Gods and Buddhas, and the Swordless Sword Form successively emerged.</p><p>Under the combination of the three realms, Empress Beibei merged with the Supreme Emperor Sword, and with a tremor of the sword body, she shattered the thousands of devilish energies of the fierce demons.</p><p>Suddenly, All Things are Swords transformed everything into a Devil Sword.</p><p>“Absolute Devil Control!”</p><p>The Ten Thousand Sword Technique, a mutation of Absolute Imperial Control, in the Devil Sword version?</p><p>Feng Zhongzui’s eyes nearly popped out, and even his commentary halted for a moment as he stared dead at the scene.</p><p>It was evident that the Sword Deity Bei’s comprehension of the first level of other sword techniques was not deep, but he was barely able to use them.</p><p>And this instantaneous adaptation was so exquisitely executed that it deserved to be recorded in the annals of ancient swordsmanship history as a reference for handling situations specific to Lord Shou and the Devil Sword Technique of the vicious Fourth Swords, and the demonic power.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>As Sword Will erupted with a roar, the demonic aura that originally belonged to the Heavenly Unravel Imagery of the Fourth Swords was now a thousand swords under the control of “Absolute Devil Control.”</p><p>This ownership was temporarily stripped away by Beibei!</p><p>Leveraging this temporary ownership, Beibei also found the true form of Xu Xiaoshou hidden within the Heavenly Unravel Imagery.</p><p>“Emperor…”</p><p>She was just about to exert force…</p><p>But Beibei was a genius, and how could Xu Xiaoshou’s battle consciousness and spontaneous reaction be any less shrewd than anyone else’s?</p><p>Before she could even speak, a deafening reverberation from the Nine Heavens thundered:</p><p>“If you want to slay demons, I will become the demon!”</p><p>“Let’s see whether your novice Absolute Devil Control is superior or if I, being a Demon Under Eyes, am crazier than you!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoji!”</p><p>The Supreme Emperor Sword quivered, and Beibei, merging within, sensed the omen of misfortune, while on the other side, Xu Xiaoji, who had fully grasped Lord Shou’s will after Heavenly Unravel, had already made his move.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>Under the controlled ten thousand Devil Swords, suddenly, a Mo Sword swung rhythmically like a shadowy reflection, transforming into a river.</p><p>“Green River Sword Boundary!” Feng Zhongzui’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The Devil Swords, whose ownership was temporarily stolen by the Heavenly Unravel of the Emperor Sword, concealed themselves for a moment, while the Mo Sword, still not under Beibei’s control, solidified instead.</p><p>The Devil Sword turned a green hue.</p><p>The Mo Sword took on a deep black.</p><p>The two had switched places!</p><p>“No Sword Arts? A switch between void and substance? Lord Shou is brilliant, using the truth of the Mo Sword Technique to swap out the control of one’s self under Absolute Devil Control…”</p><p>“I, I, I’m going to go insane!”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui, holding his head, was intoxicated, immersed in the moment.</p><p>The smoothness of Lord Shou’s transition between the great sword flows and the madness of his philosophy were even beyond that of Beibei!</p><p>Even old swordsmen like Mei Siren and Feng Tingchen were shocked at that moment, not anticipating such a solution immediately.</p><p>It was unexpected!</p><p>But very Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>Having activated the combat strength of the Fourth Sword’s Heavenly Unravel Imagery and turned passivity into aggression, Xu Xiaoshou certainly wasn’t going to wait idly for Beibei to come at him again.</p><p>The ten thousand Mo Swords, dyed into Devil Swords, all aligned themselves at a tilted angle and began to flow in the fashion of the Green River Sword Boundary, eventually rapidly outlining an actual Sword God’s imagery!</p><p>Lonely Building, silver moon, black sword, silhouette…</p><p>“My heavens! What is this?”</p><p>“Fantasy Sword Technique? Heart Sword Technique? Swordless Sword Technique?”</p><p>“This is an attack on the spiritual world of the Sword Deity Bei, materialized by Lord Shou. What does he want to do?”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui’s eyes were wide open with bewilderment, “This is a battle of Sword Deities, a battle of Heavenly Unravel! Xiao Wanfeng, are you watching? I can’t keep up with their thinking anymore!”</p><p>If Feng Zhongzui couldn’t keep up, Beibei had never seen this kind of swordsmanship.</p><p>The Heart Sword Technique, the attack of Demons Under Eyes imagined, materialized in a physical way—what harm could it do?</p><p>A mental attack affecting the body was like the contrary example of hitting a human spirit with a stone—could it hit at all?</p><p>“This is my chance!”</p><p>This sword technique was clearly Xu Xiaoshou going mad with play, hitting a snag in the process.</p><p>Not to seize the Gifts From The Universe and send this guy packing directly? Beibei was contemplating this when she hadn’t moved yet, but suddenly felt a distortion in the fabric of spacetime…</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>The imagery of the Sword God, Gu Louying, suddenly fragmented.</p><p>Empowered by the infinite might and ingenious ideas of the Heavenly Unravel State, this entity manifested from the Heart Sword Technique’s imaginary attack, was directly shattered by Xu Xiaoshou himself!</p><p>Too weak.</p><p>No need.</p><p>If one is to play, then play big!</p><p>“Roar——”</p><p>A terrifying sonic boom surged within the endless demonic energy.</p><p>The phantom forms of the Four Great Fierce Beasts transfigured and ultimately converged into one point, merging with the imagery of the Sword God, Gu Louying, that had just crumbled…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
