Dao Xuanji’s, or Xu Xiaoshou’s?</p><p>Why didn’t anyone care to take charge!?</p><p>He thought about staying to live and die together, but it felt like too much trouble. In the end, with a twist of his eyes, he still lifted the World in the Palm and pulled away.</p><p>“The Heavenly Unravel of the Supreme Emperor Sword…”</p><p>“An outbreak in a state of perfect fit…”</p><p>“Beibei really isn’t just testing the waters; he has even brought out his trump card… But indeed, worthy of a Sword Deity!”</p><p>Positioned within the grand palace, Xu Xiaoshou was neither shocked nor fearful; he took in all the surrounding transformations, even daring to risk his life.</p><p>He had witnessed the heavenly solution of a famed sword.</p><p>The strongest one had to belong to Master Siren’s Taicheng Sword Heavenly Unravel, capable of withstanding the Holy Emperor’s thought incarnation!</p><p>But even the strongest…</p><p>Master Siren and the Taicheng Sword were not in tune; it was a forced Heavenly Unravel, considerably weaker in power.</p><p>Like Beibei, who embodied a Sword Deity, wielding the Heavenly Unravel of a renowned sword at the level of Five Great Divine Instruments of Chaos, Xu Xiaoshou was seeing it for the first time.</p><p>And it was a Perfect Heavenly Unravel!</p><p>The only regret was that her realm was more than a notch below Master Siren’s…</p><p>“Preliminary estimations suggest she has combat strength at the demi-saint stage, and not just an ordinary one at that.”</p><p>“This might very well be the foundation of her being able to rank among the Seven Sword Deities and qualify as the ruler of the white-clothed people.”</p><p>“Afraid?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked down at the Hidden Bitter which was stubbornly unbent and trembling.</p><p>“Woo…”</p><p>Hidden Bitter was almost sobbing—who wouldn’t be afraid?</p><p>Even atop the Supreme Emperor Sword, Xu Xiaoshou had never seen a sword spirit imbued with such rich emotions.</p><p>He provoked it, “If you’re scared, I can bring out your two big brothers right now, but you can forget about surpassing them in this lifetime.”</p><p>Thump!!</p><p>Hidden Bitter suddenly sprang up, straightening its sword body.</p><p>The sound of the sword’s cry resonated endlessly within the brilliant palace.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled and grabbed it, giving it a gentle shake and twirling a sword flower, “Here it comes…”</p><p>…</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The wind howled and the colors of heaven and earth changed.</p><p>Under the gaze of tens of thousands, those in front of the Five Domains Preaching Mirror saw a towering eight-sided phantom of the Supreme Emperor Sword materializing on top of the giant Emperor’s Palace that trapped Lord Shou.</p><p>It reached up into the clouds, suspended yet unlanded, its colossal tip already piercing into the Emperor’s Palace.</p><p>It stood there, receiving no Imperial Decree, yet drawing endless Sword Wills from within tens of thousands of miles to fortify itself step by step.</p><p>“Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…”</p><p>The World in the Palm outside Jade Capital City was penetrated by spacetime leaps as numerous flying swords came screaming through.</p><p>One sword after the other turned golden en route and spat out sword flashes, gathering into a golden Dragon.</p><p>“Boom, boom, boom…”</p><p>Outside the city, the onlooking Sword Deities and sword saints, and the sword forces from the surrounding areas of Jade Capital City, followed suit, contributing to a spectacularly surging tide of swords.</p><p>This tide rose up from all directions, outlined by various Sword Wills, and eventually also poured into the making of a golden Sword Dragon.</p><p>The two Sword Dragons then struck against the grand gates of the Emperor Palace, breaking in to assault the insides of the Supreme Emperor Sword.</p><p>The screen of the Dao Imparting Mirror switched to the scene within the Heavenly Unravel Imagery.</p><p>One could see the palace’s dome had been shattered, admitting a greatsword’s tip that seemed capable of ending the world.</p><p>Beneath the sword, one seemed like a desert dweller catching drips from a hanging sword for thirst relief—seemingly trivial.</p><p>“Emperor Sword·Twin Phoenix Dragon!”</p><p>With that call, the only Sovereign throne within the palace revealed a regal phantom of an Empress.</p><p>She merely floated her arms slightly upward…</p><p>“Boom! Boom!”</p><p>Outside the palace, the two huge Golden Dragons, bearing the onslaught of ten thousand swords, rushed to protect their monarch.</p><p>The mere ripples that swept past were like towering waves that inundated the solitary boat, submerging Xu Xiaoshou, who was trapped within the Emperor’s Palace.</p><p>“Is Lord Shou dead?!”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui cried out in shock, hastily enlarging the image.</p><p>Everyone hastily looked on, only to see Lord Shou amid the tide of Sword Intent—floating like rootless duckweed…</p><p>But he was the root!</p><p>He was rooted in the void, allowing the surging Sword Intent to pass through him unfazed.</p><p>He formed Sword Cognition from Observation, brushed Hidden Bitter with his fingertips, then followed through with a light flick.</p><p>“Sword Style.”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The countless tidal waves, at that moment, reversed their course.</p><p>Elegantly following Hidden Bitter’s sword cognition, he slashed toward the Empress’s figure on the throne.</p><p>“Reversing Path?”</p><p>“Inverting Path?”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui cried out, “He reversed the Sword Intent tide of the Dual Phoenix Dragons and with sword cognition as the edge, has returned a strike! This is the Penetrating Divine Senses 2.0!”</p><p>The screen switched to the Empress’s phantom on the throne.</p><p>Seeing her standing in the air, with Golden Dragons swirling beneath both arms, emanating presence without anger.</p><p>“No mistake!”</p><p>“What we saw earlier from the Dual Phoenix Dragons was merely an aftermath.”</p><p>“The Dual Phoenix Dragons are the visualization of the Absolute Imperial Control by the Ten Thousand Sword Technique, and Sword Deity Bei’s command of this realm is simply impeccable.”</p><p>“Now, it’s time for the real attack following the Emperor Sword Heavenly Unravel. You’d better keep your eyes peeled for this!”</p><p>Along with Feng Zhongzui’s fervent commentary, a chilling voice suddenly erupted inside the Emperor’s Palace:</p><p>“Rebels, be slain!”</p><p>The Empress flicked her sleeve, and a Golden Dragon darted from her right arm, “Go!”</p><p>With a dragon’s roar lifting waves through space, even the image on the Dao Imparting Mirror began to distort.</p><p>In the next instant, it collided with the Sword Intent tide, led by sword cognition.</p><p>“Bang, bang, bang, bang…”</p><p>The explosive sound and the cascading layers of distorted space seemed ready to blow through the Dao Imparting Mirror, hitting the viewers across the five regions in the face.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
