This laugh did not seem to be mocking, but rather, it seemed to be self-deprecating.</p><p>On the southern wall, Yu Zhiwen looked at the black-robed youth in the sky and clenched her fists.</p><p>How similar was Xu Xiaoshou’s question to the one she had asked Lu Ke before the Path Pattern Initial Stone in the White Cave?</p><p>There was once an opportunity in front of her. If she had made the decision to turn “left” or “right”, the road ahead would have been different and beautiful.</p><p>But because of her usual cowardice, Yu Zhiwen chose to retreat.</p><p>This was the decision she regretted the most in her life.</p><p>Back in the Four Symbols Secret Realm, Yu Zhiwen had abandoned her past self and found her true heart.</p><p>Therefore, when Xu Xiaoshou’s question required a high-ranking official of Holy Divine Palace to answer, and the old red-clothed person wanted to say something but hesitated…</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Fang Wenxin didn’t say anything.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen leaped into the sky.</p><p>The dazzling divine path pattern transformed into a pair of butterfly wings that brought her away from the eyes of countless people in the Jade Capital City.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>“Saintess, Yu Zhiwen!”</p><p>“The new Chief of the Path Division. Why is she here?”</p><p>While everyone was still in shock, Yu Zhiwen joined the battle without permission. She faced Xu Xiaoshou, who was still in shock.</p><p>“Yes, Xu Xiaoshou. There are good and evil ghost beasts. The red-clothed people have gone astray and are secretly studying ghost beasts…”</p><p>“But in fact, it’s not as bad as you think.”</p><p>The entire city was in an uproar!</p><p>Most people couldn’t hear the second half of Yu Zhiwen’s sentence because the first half was already shocking enough.</p><p>At that moment, Spiritual Cultivators in the city thought they had heard wrongly.</p><p>Path Division Chief Yu Zhiwen personally came forward to answer Xu Xiaoshou’s question. No, she confirmed his problem.</p><p>The red-clothed people have gone astray.</p><p>They even studied the ghost beasts?</p><p>Why were the red-clothed people studying the ghost beasts in secret?</p><p>What was Yu Zhiwen saying? What nonsense was she spouting?</p><p>On the horizon, Elder Yu turned around and saw that the speaker was his obedient Little Yu. He was so scared that he lost his calm and scolded angrily,</p><p>“Leave!”</p><p>“Yu Zhiwen, leave!”</p><p>“You do not have the right to speak here. Hurry up and leave.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was also stunned.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” He thought.</p><p>“I wanted to kidnap Fang Wenxin, and I wanted to mess with his mentality. I wanted him to ask himself if Dao Xuanji or his path was more important!”</p><p>“As the disciple of Hallmaster Xuanji, do you know the consequences of saying such rebellious words in public?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyebrows shot up and he shouted, “Leave!”</p><p>“Who do you think you’re shouting at?”</p><p>Elder Yu rushed in front of his Little Yu and was about to pull her away when he heard the voice. He turned around and said angrily, “Xu Xiaoshou, who do you think you’re shouting at? I dare you to say another word loudly!”</p><p>“She’s the one I’m shouting at!” Xu Xiaoshou shouted again and pointed at Yu Zhiwen,</p><p>“Did I ask her a question?”</p><p>“You’re just the Chief of Path Division, a mere Divine Sorceress. Why don’t you take a look at yourself in the mirror and see what level you are at? How dare you come out and confront me?”</p><p>“If you know what’s good for you, get lost now. I’ll pretend I’ve never seen anything!”</p><p>Tsk…</p><p>Elder Yu’s entire body trembled, and two streams of green water vapor suddenly spurted out of his nostrils.</p><p>Weng weng!</p><p>The entire Jade Capital City instantly shook.</p><p>“Screech-”</p><p>In the sky, the cry of a roc rang out.</p><p>Elder Yu’s Holy Power burst out from his body and was about to release his sacred physique.</p><p>“Grandpa Yu.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen hurriedly stretched out her hand and grabbed the Kun Peng God Envoy who was on the verge of anger.</p><p>“Don’t stop me!”</p><p>“Grandpa Yu, I want to kill him. I want to help you kill this arrogant human!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen shook her head lightly.</p><p>Although Xu Xiaoshou’s words were hurtful, she was smart and could tell…</p><p>His hostility was to better defend his position?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen looked over calmly and said softly,</p><p>“Since your Innate Stage, you dared to say whatever you want and you dared to do as you please at the Master stage. Now that you’re at the Sovereign Stage, you even dared to question the Holy Divine Palace.”</p><p>“I’m already the head of the Dao Division, how can I not be qualified to answer your question?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath. Seeing that this silly girl still did not retreat, his eyes instantly widened as he threatened,</p><p>“Qualified?!”</p><p>“I am in the Sovereign Dao Realm and can kill you as easily as chopping vegetables. Taking down your Sacred Mountain Hallmaster would be like slaughtering a chicken. How could you possibly compare to me?”</p><p>“I am a Sovereign. I despise the demi-saints like pigs and dogs. I despise the Holy Emperor aristocratic families like dust. How dare you and how are you worthy of talking to me?”</p><p>Rustle!</p><p>Golden light exploded!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly transformed into a Berserk Giant, gathering the power of the Heavenly Ancestor, and with a thunderous roar, he smashed a foot down onto the Xuanji Great Array.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The water-curtain-like array was forcefully kicked open!</p><p>With a swoosh, the entire city fell silent.</p><p>The wind and snow were blowing, and the people in the city were trembling in fear. They were all afraid of this world-shocking giant.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was stunned.</p><p>She was well aware of Xu Xiaoshou’s sharp tongue, but it was only when she faced him directly again that she was startled to realize that even in defense…</p><p>He was really hurtful!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen pursed her lips, feeling wronged. Under that imposing aura that could swallow mountains and rivers, she was secretly trembling like rootless duckweed.</p><p>“How dare you!”</p><p>Elder Yu couldn’t take it anymore.</p><p>He stood up and pounced in Xu Xiaoshou’s direction, the holy power swirling around his body.</p><p>“Bullsh*t!”</p><p>Elder Yu still knew how to stop, but Xu Xiaoshou was burning with rage. When he was about to face him, the power of the Heavenly Ancestor and the Dragon Ancestor covered him.</p><p>Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand was wrapped in a layer of golden dragon scales.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Elder Yu’s attack was sent flying by the Berserk Giant.</p><p>“Grandpa Yu!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen couldn’t even reach out to grab Grandpa Yu. She could only watch helplessly as he was sent flying into the space debris.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>Everyone in the Jade Capital City gasped.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou did not stop. Instead, he pushed his luck and punched the Xuanji great array.</p><p>Crack crack!</p><p>The array cracked open with patterns like a spider web.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at Fang Wenxin from the corner of his eyes. Seeing that she still did not move, he was furious.</p><p>He looked at Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe in the distance and took a deep breath. In the next second, he circulated his holy power and shouted,</p><p>“I think this Holy Divine Palace is seriously ill. I think the red-clothed people are rotten to the bone from top to bottom!”</p><p>“Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe is a beautiful place. It has raised countless demi-saints and Holy Emperors, yet all it can produce are these spineless people who only know how to bow.”</p><p>“The name ‘Guizhe’ is a good name!”</p><p>“There’s actually no one on the Sacred Mountain who has the guts to come out and answer my words. Since you all could only rely on a woman, in that case…”</p><p>The Berserk giant inserted his hands into the Xuanji great array and lifted it under everyone’s shocked gaze.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The water-curtain-like great array was immediately flipped upside down.</p><p>Heaven and earth exploded and shattered divine path patterns were everywhere. Thunderous rumbles echoed in all directions.</p><p>“Today, I will blow up this city and tear down this mountain. Let’s see what kind of snakes, rats, birds, and insects are hiding under this grand justice!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
