He glanced at Fang Wenxin and saw that he had stopped his act of absorbing Greedy the Cat Spirit’s soul.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was never troubled by criticism, nor did he stop talking.</p><p>“…While conducting alchemy, I used Greedy the Cat Spirit’s Body of Devour to test poisons and create new Elixirs.”</p><p>“You might not believe it, but you may or may not have eaten the Elixirs made by the Greedy the Cat Spirit before.”</p><p>“In the Eastern Region, during my cooperation with Magic Pill Technicians Association of Dongtianwang City, the first batch of the ‘Amber Juice’ came from the hands of the Greedy the Cat Spirit!”</p><p>Fang Wenxin turned her eyes abruptly and looked at Xu Xiaoshou with trembling eyes.</p><p>Amber Juice?</p><p>He did not know what this was.</p><p>Neither Elder Yu, Zhong Yuanzi, nor the others knew.</p><p>However, the large number of low-level Spiritual Cultivators in Jade Capital City were all in a state of uproar, after hearing Xu Xiaoshou’s words.</p><p>“Amber Juice?”</p><p>“Impossible, I’ve eaten Amber Juice before! I still have three boxes on me. These are from… Uh, I think the shop owner did say that it’s a medicine that originated from the Eastern Region’s Dongtianwang City…”</p><p>“Is Xu Xiaoshou joking? He’s a Saint Servant, how could Magic Pill Technicians Association cooperate with him?”</p><p>“No! He isn’t joking, I’ve heard about this ‘Amber Juice’ before, it was something he started working with Magic Pill Technicians Association before he became a Saint Servant,”</p><p>“Yes, and Spirit Cultivation Juice! Putting everything else aside, the two elixir formulas he sold to the Magic Pill Technicians Association have benefited the low-level Spiritual Cultivators of the five regions.”</p><p>“No! How could I have received a favor from this jerk? I’m someone who wants to join the Holy Divine Guards! I don’t believe it!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The criticism from the Jade Capital City was heard by the demi-saints in the sky.</p><p>Mei Siren smiled at his student with pride in his eyes. He slowly opened his fan and said,</p><p>“You’re worth teaching.”</p><p>The three Saints of the Holy Divine Palace didn’t need any further verification.</p><p>They could tell from the discussion that Xu Xiaoshou was not joking this time.</p><p>The Holy Emperor’s aura of Swallow Mountains and Rivers guided the emotions of everyone in the city back to calm.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said slowly,</p><p>“It’s not just Amber Juice and Spirit Cultivation Juice.”</p><p>“In the process of reaching the Sovereign stage in elixir alchemy, Greedy the Cat Spirit also studied the Origin Court Juice and the Soul Resting Juice… etcetera,”</p><p>“Unfortunately, at that time, I had no choice but to sell these elixir formulas…Mm, I mean give them to the Magic Pill Technicians Association to benefit the five regions.”</p><p>Ignoring the people in the city, Xu Xiaoshou looked at Fang Wenxin and said,</p><p>“I’m not saying this to plead for Greedy the Cat Spirit but to state a fact.”</p><p>“Before Greedy the Cat Spirit was driven mad by your previous Hallmaster Dao, it was indeed a good cat, a good cat that benefited mankind.”</p><p>“Maybe it doesn’t know how to catch mice, but it really shouldn’t have fallen into its present state. It shouldn’t have become a street rat that everyone hates.”</p><p>After a pause, in front of the first-generation red-clothed people, Xu Xiaoshou asked the question that had puzzled him for a long time,</p><p>“Elder Fang, I would like to ask another question…”</p><p>“Ghost beasts, are there really no good beasts?”</p><p>At the southern end of Jade Capital City.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man retreated from the Deadly Path.</p><p>He put away the Blood World Pearl, leaned on his knees, and sat on the tallest rock on the lone mountain.</p><p>The mountains were silent, and the wind and snow were lonely.</p><p>Soon, his body was covered in a layer of white.</p><p>Under the mask, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man looked into the distance, lost in thought.</p><p>He suddenly reached out and moved his mask.</p><p>However, after thinking about it, he did not take it off. Instead, he wore it even tighter.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators of Jade Capital were divided into two factions.</p><p>One faction had a strong thirst for knowledge. They were suddenly curious why they had not learned more about the ghost beasts before.</p><p>Why was there not even a bit of information about the ghost beasts on the continent?</p><p>For example, there was a creature called “tiger” in this world. It was actually quite common and could be seen in the mountains and forests, but it had never been recorded in ancient books or jade scrolls.</p><p>Even in the academy, they vaguely summed it up with the two words ‘tiger’ and quickly moved on. They did not recall any more information.</p><p>If they didn’t understand Ghost Beasts, how could they guard against them?</p><p>The other faction was still following their past thinking habits and thought that Xu Xiaoshou was still spouting nonsense.</p><p>Under the rule of the Holy Divine Palace, the supreme being was the Holy Divine Palace itself.</p><p>The Saint Servant’s words were heresy, so there was no need to pay attention to them.</p><p>However, no matter which faction it was, they all hoped that the higher-ups could give an answer.</p><p>They turned to look at Fang Wenxin.</p><p>He was said to be a first-generation red-clothed person, so he definitely had the most convincing and authoritative answer to the question of “Ghost Beast”.</p><p>“Elder Fang, say it!”</p><p>“What exactly is a ghost beast? Xu Xiaoshou is talking nonsense, right?”</p><p>“Anyway, I don’t think much of the ghost beast. Look at this Greedy the Cat Spirit. It’s extremely ferocious and wants to eat anyone it sees…”</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Greed, the ghost beast, seemed to have seized the opportunity when Fang Wenxin was distracted and almost broke free.</p><p>Fang Wenxin suddenly woke up and took control of the Blood Shadow Copper Coin in time.</p><p>But at this moment…</p><p>It wasn’t just Xu Xiaoshou, nor the Spiritual Cultivators in Jade Capital… He was also the one who would like to know the truth.</p><p>Fang Wenxin opened his mouth and lost his focus again.</p><p>“Elder Fang!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s words woke up the old red-clothed person who had almost lost his mind.</p><p>“Human nature is good. Without teaching, there is no change. They will still be a saint.”</p><p>“The nature of the beast is evil. It has never been taught to be good. Kill it when you see it.”</p><p>“Am I right?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
