He gave a brief “Mm” in response, stepped onto the Power Upanishad Formation beneath his feet, and vanished without another word.</p><p>…</p><p>Southern Region, Feng family.</p><p>Located in the Land of Sin, this clan, inheriting the spirit of the ancient swordsman era, could be considered a lone wolf in the Southern Region.</p><p>They were one of the few who were not bounty hunters!</p><p>As long as someone bore the Feng surname in the Southern Region and didn’t commit any grave offenses, even if they weren’t a Feng family member… if they had a sword at their waist, people would still show them some respect.</p><p>The Feng family ruled a city simply named Feng Family City.</p><p>Feng Family City was quite small, far from comparable to Dongtianwang City. It more closely resembled a small city like Tiansang City.</p><p>In the Southern Region, there were still counties and cities delineated by the Holy Divine Palace, but the Holy Divine Palace had little influence there, and the people of the Southern Region didn’t recognize it.</p><p>As a result, the Southern Region’s land was very fragmented, with chaotic armies and a mix of good and bad elements. Those who could control a nominal city were already extremely powerful.</p><p>Feng Family City was divided into the main family and the auxiliary city.</p><p>The Feng residence, built around the three famous spots of “Perched Crane Residence,” “Sword Pagoda,” and “Wind Listening Pavilion,” was the main residence.</p><p>The thirty-three streets built around the main house, spread out like the Eight Trigrams Array Diagram, constituted the auxiliary city.</p><p>At this moment, the Feng mansion was in an uproar.</p><p>Gray-clad servants and maids hurriedly moved in and out, relaying messages.</p><p>Feng family members in various colored attire flew on their swords with lightning speed.</p><p>“Quick, quick, quick!”</p><p>“Master Siren personally issued the order. Feng family disciples, move out quickly!”</p><p>“Everyone, listen up… The family head has ordered those who are free to immediately mobilize and contact the Dao Imparting Mirror holders in the major royal cities of the five regions. The first battle of the Sword Deity Battle is about to begin!”</p><p>“Especially the Dao Imparting Mirror in the Eastern Region’s Holy Sword Land. We must ensure nothing goes wrong. Let the people there keep a close watch… The Eighth Sword Deity has dominated the ancient swordsman circle for so long. The Fringe Moon Immortal City, as a rising star, is already surpassing us… It’s time to reclaim our Feng family’s glory!”</p><p>“Yes, sir!”</p><p>“Where is Feng Xiaohan? The family head has ordered him to immediately activate the first spectator stand in the Feng family’s auxiliary city. The pre-battle glory of Sword Deity Beibei and Sword Deity Xu Xiaoshou must be recorded… Especially Lord Shou! The spectator stand has been prepared, and everyone is waiting. Hurry up and go!”</p><p>“Yes, sir!”</p><p>“Where is Feng Xiaoshuang? The family head has ordered him to immediately go to the Perched Crane Residence to invite Senior Yang Xizhi to the Wind Listening Pavilion to await the Saint… Demi-Saint Ye is arriving. This is a grand event for the Feng family. We cannot be negligent! Remember, Demi-Saint’s surname is Ye. If you get the name wrong, don’t bother coming back. Just end yourself!”</p><p>“Yes, sir!”</p><p>“Where is Feng Zhongzhi? The family head has ordered him to immediately head to the Sword Pagoda and respectfully invite He Jian and Ting Chen out of the pagoda to burn incense, wash the sword, test the gold, and seal the scabbard… You’re responsible for the entire process! Remember, this is your honor. You only have one chance. Go quickly!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>“Where is Feng Zhongzui? You brat, drinking secretly again! The family head’s order…”</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The excited and frantic Feng family suddenly stopped, turning their gaze toward the sky.</p><p>In the auxiliary city of the Feng family, the sword-wielding spiritual cultivators were all fired up and eagerly looked up into the sky.</p><p>In the center of the first spectator stand, a massive square that could hold 100,000 people, a gigantic Dao Imparting Mirror—300 meters wide—stood. This mirror could transmit sound, images, and intent. The swordsmen suddenly felt something and looked up.</p><p>“Younger Master Xu…”</p><p>In the crowd, Xiao Wanfeng touched his chest, feeling the sword intent boiling within him.</p><p>His fervent gaze shifted from the halo on the Dao Imparting Mirror to the sky.</p><p>High above, Holy Power pulsed, quickly unfolding into a dazzling Power Upanishad Formation.</p><p>The Path Principles within were complex and profound, surprising all who beheld them.</p><p>At the Feng mansion, atop the Wind Listening Pavilion, an old figure led the way, emerging with the sound of a sword.</p><p>“Welcome, Demi-Saint Ye!”</p><p>His voice was strong and resonated throughout Feng family City.</p><p>All the ancient swordsmen and spiritual cultivators in Feng Family City were shaken, and they shouted in unison, “Welcome, Demi-Saint Ye!”</p><p>The sound waves surged like a tide, shaking the space.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian appeared above the Power Upanishad Formation. Looking down, he saw all the beings on the ground bowing their heads and cupping their hands.</p><p>At that moment, he felt unexpectedly relieved.</p><p>So be it, the teleportation portal!</p><p>D*mn, after so long, this was the first time he felt genuine respect.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian flicked his sleeve with a broad smile. “Good.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
