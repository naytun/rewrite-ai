So, what about Hallmaster Dao?”</p><p>“Aren’t you Dao Xuanji of the Three Emperors? You’re on the same level as Ai Cangsheng…”</p><p>After a pause, Xu Xiaoshou looked around.</p><p>“Where’s Arrow of Evil Sin Bow? You’ve deployed such a great array, yet he isn’t around.”</p><p>“I called him by his real name, but he did not respond. Could it be…”</p><p>“Has he also been moved by the mortal world and is eyeing the inheritance of the god slayer?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was surprised and secretly delighted.</p><p>Elder Yu was startled and called him ‘little chap.’</p><p>This young man’s thinking was just as Little Dao had described. He was too knowledgeable of the finer details.</p><p>To think he would discern as much with only a few words!</p><p>Dao Xuanji thought Xu Xiaoshou was only beginning to fear her identity as Hallmaster and the power of the Sacred Mountain she wielded.</p><p>Finally afraid? She sneered:</p><p>“I am Dao Xuanji!”</p><p>“Hey,” Xu Xiaoshou let his words drag as he spoke in disdain, “Don’t start with that nonsense. I mean, your ears might not be functional, but at least your brain should still be, shouldn’t it? I’m asking you where the real Hallmaster is if you can’t tell. Now, where did Elder Dao the Flamboyant run off to?”</p><p>“Haha…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s laughter had only just petered when she was struck again, convulsing with tear-inducing giggles. “Ahh! White, White Dragon, save me, save…”</p><p>Dao Xuanji suddenly understood.</p><p>On the bounty listed by the Sacred Mountain for Xu Xiaoshou, his persona had been tagged with things like ‘glib tongue’ and ‘speaking without thinking.’</p><p>Was this the Lip Spear, Tongue Sword that her brother had noted in his profile of Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>If one had never encountered his skill, one would never have understood the horror or the rage Xu Xiaoshou induced…</p><p>One sentence was all Xu Xiaoshou needed to retort in three different ways!</p><p>Any comebacks were futile, for it merely gave him more ammunition!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s skill was so formidable that it left one speechless!</p><p>“The best way to deal with him isn’t to engage him in dialogue but to meet him head-on.”</p><p>However, Dao Qiongcang added a qualifier, “That’s the case for anyone other but me.”</p><p>Dao Xuanji did not believe her brother until she was the victim of Xu Xiaoshou’s vicious tongue.</p><p>As the current head of the Holy Divine Palace, how could she not suppress this ignorant upstart that was Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang killed the judge of the Stairway to Heaven and absconded in fear of punishment. No one is above the rules. All those who defile them must face the consequences.” Dao Xuanji’s words echoed to those listening in Jade Capital City, her words conveying her indomitable pride.</p><p>Now, she no longer had to introduce herself; Xu Xiaoshou’s question had done it for her, pushing her reputation as Hallmaster to greater heights.</p><p>A heated discussion broke out in the city again.</p><p>Even Yu Zhiwen, who was on the city wall, could not help but frown. She still had doubts about this theory, but…</p><p>Since her Supreme Master had said so, it was unlikely to be a joke. What’s more, she had made such a declaration to the public.</p><p>Her master cared deeply about her reputation, if nothing else.</p><p>Atop Greedy the Cat Spirit, Xu Xiaoshou listened in petrified silence.</p><p>“So, you’ve replaced Elder Dao the Flamboyant, I take it?”</p><p>“I took over!” Dao Xuanji spat, angered that Xu Xiaoshou would diminish the prestige of her position by suggesting that she was a mere replacement.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stood abruptly, his eyes twinkling brightly.</p><p>His lips curled into a faint smirk, which he quickly forced down. He was only marginally successful, and his mouth twitched uncontrollably, eventually cracking a smile that was all teeth.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou covered his mouth as he eyed the old granny, Xuanji. Then, he thought about how “Unfathomable Dao Qiongcang” was no longer around. Now, his enemy was “Nameless Junior Dao Xuanji…”</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>A snicker still escaped him.</p><p>Jade Capital City fell into pin-drop silence.</p><p>There was no need for him to say anything else.</p><p>All that had been said was conveyed in his laughter.</p><p>Dao Xuanji had never felt more humiliated in her life!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s smile was as if he had stepped on her head and ground it into the ground.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed dangerously as her gaze swept over all the Saints with their heads bowed. All of Jade Capital City trembled, knowing they were on thin ice.</p><p>No one spoke.</p><p>However, the reaction they had to Xu Xiaoshou’s words was enough. They probably all thought…</p><p>‘Am I inferior to him?’</p><p>Dao Xuanji quivered, gritting her teeth in barely controlled rage.</p><p>“You. Dare. Laugh?!”</p><p>“Sorry, sorry…” Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly placated, but his lips seemed to have a mind of their own and continued twitching uncontrollably, saliva dribbling out of his mouth.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” he said, wiping the saliva away in shame. “I just remembered something funny, that’s all.”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A sonic boom sounded.</p><p>A Celestial Scroll unfurled under Dao Xuanji’s feet. She was so furious that she almost lashed out.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried to change the topic. He pointed at her feet, exclaiming in surprise:</p><p>“Wow, it’s the Celestial Scroll. I’ve heard about it. It isn’t easy to cultivate… Did your brother teach you?”</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>Elder Yu gasped, his back drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not just playing with fire.</p><p>He was dancing into forbidden territory!</p><p>There were many things Dao Xuanji could tolerate, but this?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s eyes turned crimson. Stepping on the Celestial Scroll with her horsetail whisk in hand, Dao Xuanji, a Divine Sorceress, stepped out of the protection the Xuanji great array afforded and confronted Xu Xiaoshou directly.</p><p>As the wind whistled, her arm fell back along with her sleeve, revealing her jade-white skin.</p><p>Divine path patterns lit up, and inscriptions so complex that they made one’s scalp go numb upon looking traveled up her skin.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s carefree smile disappeared as he turned into ash with a wave of his sleeves.</p><p>All that remained was the jade-white hand that had blocked the Holy Emperor’s attack on Abyss Island, that same hand that he used to face Dao Qiongcang…</p><p>The Sleeveless Scarlet Scorched Hand of Penetrating Divine Senses…</p><p>Boom!</p><p>“No!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
