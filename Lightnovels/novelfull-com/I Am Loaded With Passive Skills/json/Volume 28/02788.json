No, from the Supreme Emperor Sword!</p><p>…</p><p>“Something’s not right…”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui, with his strong combat senses, also realized something was amiss.</p><p>The image in the Dao Imparting Mirror shifted, and everything returned from the illusory ideology.</p><p>What everyone first saw was the Sword Deity Beibei, in all her nobility, stained with black devilish energy.</p><p>Secondly, they saw Xu Xiaoshou, who looked slightly bewildered.</p><p>“Has Sword Deity Bei deviated?”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui cried out in shock with a hint of disbelief, yet he answered his own question:</p><p>“Yes, she has deviated. You may not know this, but Xu Xiaoshou’s Heart Sword Technique imagery is that of a ‘Sword God’!”</p><p>“Such imagery has too great an impact on ancient swordsmen; I too was briefly absent-minded.”</p><p>“But as for me, to put it simply, I’m heartless and thoughtless. If I were to elaborate…”</p><p>“Shut up!!!” Beibei suddenly roared.</p><p>The Supreme Emperor Sword, tinged with black devilish energy, was forcefully planted by her into the void upon her command.</p><p>“Boom—”</p><p>Golden black sword waves rolled out and spread.</p><p>All the swordsmen present quickly drew back, swiftly retreating from the Arena.</p><p>Devilish energy invasion was not something desirable.</p><p>Especially Mei Siren, who after glancing at the Dao Imparting Mirror, had countless possibilities flash through his mind and fled even faster than a rabbit.</p><p>Feng Zhongzui was startled and fired off a rapid succession of words, “I’ll shut up for a bit then, cultivation deviation isn’t easy to deal with after all. If Sword Deity Bei can come out of it, her state of extreme despair will surely advance further. If not, she might well lose her life today…”</p><p>“Shut up!!!”</p><p>Beibei furiously drew the Emperor’s Sword towards herself.</p><p>She was indeed capable of restraining herself from lashing out at those not involved in the dry conflict, directing all her fury at her opponent across from her:</p><p>“I! Never! Lose!”</p><p>Hum!</p><p>As the eight-sided Emperor’s Swords were drawn from the spaces, like being unsheathed with a clang, they vanished.</p><p>The final image left to everyone was the furious eyes on the Emperor’s Sword hilt, now tainted red and black with overwhelming killing intent!</p><p>The state of battle suddenly changed all around.</p><p>Beibei abruptly looked up, and her body, mad with devilish energy, shone with a dazzling golden light, somehow snapping back to clarity from her deviated state.</p><p>Utilizing the shock from this bout of deviation…</p><p>The Supreme Emperor Sword had not disappeared; it had merged into one with her!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized this, his pupils constricted. Understanding the reason, he straightened up Hidden Bitter, who had curled up against his arm in fear, “Be brave, it’s not like you haven’t seen big scenes before!”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui was also stunned, his commentary coming to a halt, “What, what is this?”</p><p>Sword Deity Bei, honored as one of the Seven Sword Deity, managed to emerge from the ‘Demons Under Eyes’ state so swiftly, which he could understand.</p><p>With the aid of devilish energy to become deviated, then using the wrath of the devil’s might to break through the deviation, and upon returning to take control of the Demon Lord’s Holy Intent, the one who has become man and sword as one…</p><p>This, what kind of swordsmanship is it?</p><p>Feng Zhongzui had yet to reach that bold conclusion.</p><p>At the horizon, beneath Sword Deity Bei’s feet, a golden Power Upanishad Formation began to slowly unravel and expand!</p><p>Above the Nine Heavens, even more ethereal and faint sounds could be heard, devoid of emotions, as if witnessing the birth and death of all:</p><p>“The lord is not the lord, and the vassal is not the vassal… ”</p><p>“The world is not the world, and the people are without order… ”</p><p>“The law is not the law, and the path is not the path… ”</p><p>“The sword is not the sword, for I alone am honored… ”</p><p>…</p><p>Boom!</p><p>That overwhelming golden black Sword Will almost burst forth from the Dao Imparting Mirror, overturning ancient swordsmen from all over the five regions who were watching the battle.</p><p>“I alone am honored… ”</p><p>“Alone honored… ”</p><p>“Honored… ”</p><p>The rolling echoes, spreading through heaven and earth.</p><p>All who heard it couldn’t help but feel startled and filled with an indescribable reverence.</p><p>“What a sword!” Gu Qinger and Gu Qingsan leaped up in front of the Burial Sword Tomb, their eyes wide open, almost sucked into the scene.</p><p>“Eldest Senior Brother should have come to see this…”</p><p>“No! He does not need to, but we do!”</p><p>“That’s also true.”</p><p>“What are you talking about…” Some were at a loss.</p><p>But the obsessed swordsman had no time to answer, all were immersed in the Sword Will that came through the Dao Imparting Mirror.</p><p>“Perfect harmony…” Su Qianqian held the Devil Sword Myriad Weapons Devil Lord tightly, her heart squeezed by the realization.</p><p>If Epitaph of City Snow were still here, would they also have cultivated such understanding?</p><p>…</p><p>“Using the devil to break the method, using man to break man, acting as one wishes but not overstepping bounds… Good, she has made progress!”</p><p>On the other side, Elder Wuyue fixed his gaze on the young girl in the mirror, seeing through the figure to the sword behind her.</p><p>He tightly gripped the Demon Sword Nu Lan’s Voice, but there was not a hint of envy in his eyes.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang, who was bruised, turned his head to look at the impassive Bazhun’an.</p><p>He knew this person had the deepest insight into this path, even claimed he could solve any sword technique.</p><p>“Mhm.”</p><p>Bazhun’an said nothing, only nodding in approval.</p><p>…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Sword Will didn’t just penetrate the Dao Imparting Mirror, it also raged across the entirety of the Yu Lingdi.</p><p>Within a radius of tens of thousands of miles, during the moment of Beibei’s man and sword as one, amidst the rising sounds of Taoist music, suddenly an Emperor Palace of splendid gold and jade soared.</p><p>Above the palace, countless swords converged, forming a gesture of subservience like vassals, with none in the heavens and the earth not yielding.</p><p>Outside the palace, incessant sword cries like thousands of troops and horses, rushed forth amidst the engulfing battle smoke.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was trapped alone and defenseless.</p><p>He could no longer see Master Siren, nor could he see the noisy Feng Zhongzui.</p><p>Yet, with one hand gripping the Hidden Bitter Sword Handle and the other the Hidden Bitter Sword Point, he straightened them while…</p><p>With closed eyes, he felt the vast imperial grace, the endless imperial might, silently digesting this unique sight of “perfect harmony”.</p><p>Suddenly, a cold reprimand rose to his ears, like the deep tolling of an ancient temple bell, shaking the spirit.</p><p>“Emperor’s Sword·Heavenly Unravel!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
