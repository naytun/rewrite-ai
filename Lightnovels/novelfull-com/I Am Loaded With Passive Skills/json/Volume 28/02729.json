He could not understand the situation.</p><p>The only obvious point was that the level of the Thousand Ghost Capture technique was completely suppressed by this special Ghost Beast Contract!</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit’s soul had broken free from his technique and was about to merge with Xu Xiaoshou’s!</p><p>“Stop him!”</p><p>Fang Wenxin shouted at Elder Yu and Zhong Yuanzi.</p><p>He did not want to see Xu Xiaoshou being detained by the ghost beast and then he would shoulder the same heavy mission as himself.</p><p>Perhaps this young man had spoken about it in a casual manner.</p><p>But when he really reached that step, it was already too late, because there was no way out!</p><p>The nine Blood Shadow copper coins shot into the air and grew bigger as they flew towards the vortex of ghostly energy, in an attempt to separate the man and beast inside.</p><p>But at this moment…</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The roars from Greedy the Cat Spirit and the Berserk Giant echoed in unison.</p><p>Within the huge vortex of ghostly energy, the nine tails swept out, and the Berserk Giant’s fists and feet followed suit…</p><p>It was as if he controlled it with his mind!</p><p>Their cooperation was too tacit!</p><p>Up and down, front and back, the bombardment came in a steady stream. Fang Wenxin’s Blood Shadow copper coins were sent flying back before they could even hit anyone.</p><p>“Peng peng…”</p><p>The Blood Shadow copper coins that were sent back with such terrifying force were blocked by the ghost beast’s spirit that descended from the Nine Heavens.</p><p>However, the great force also made Fang Wenxin spit out blood and take a step back.</p><p>“We can’t block it at all!”</p><p>Fang Wenxin was shocked.</p><p>He tried to use the resonance to deflect the force, but he was still hit by the backlash of the mighty force.</p><p>Both Greedy the Cat Spirit’s body and Xu Xiaoshou’s body had boundless divine power.</p><p>How could a mere human body withstand such a special ‘ghost beast host’ body that was temporarily formed by the vortex of ghostly energy?</p><p>“Elder Yu!”</p><p>Fang Wenxin glared at Elder Yu, who fingered his own ribs cautiously. This guy was clearly not seriously injured, he just didn’t want to fight!</p><p>“Sigh.”</p><p>Elder Yu sighed.</p><p>Xi had already told him to pay attention to his safety, so how could he not know how terrifying Greedy and Xu were?</p><p>But since Fang Wenxin had already summoned him, he couldn’t slack off.</p><p>“Woo…”</p><p>A melodious Kun song sounded.</p><p>A water curtain rose up in the world and the deep blue sea appeared in the distance like a mirage. A gigantic sea beast whose entire appearance was hard to spot crashed into the vortex of ghostly energy.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>In the vortex of ghostly energy, Greedy and Xu’s forms had mutated, and a nine-tailed Ultimate Giant had risen from the center!</p><p>White fur sprouted on its body, and three blood lines were engraved on its forehead. They flowed down its back toward its huge nine tails.</p><p>Suddenly, a punch was thrown. It was covered in purple lightning, sword cognition, dragon scales, space and white and cold flames…</p><p>Before it even made any contact, the Nine-Tailed Giant’s punch caused the sky to shatter and the earth to split!</p><p>Fang Wenxin, Elder Yu, Ye Xiaotian, Mei Siren, and the others were all shocked.</p><p>During the fusion!</p><p>The man and beast had undergone a transformation and entered the second berserk form!</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen jumped up and shouted in shock.</p><p>When she saw Grandpa Yu’s Kun body and the Nine-Tailed Giant’s heavy fist about to collide, she glanced at the terrified people in the city…</p><p>Her face turned pale!</p><p>Regardless who won or lost, just the scene of full firepower was equivalent to the attack of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>Under the aftershock of such an attack, wouldn’t Jade Capital City that had lost its defenses, be destroyed and its people killed?</p><p>Tens of millions of lives!</p><p>It was understandable that Xu Xiaoshou had lost consciousness, but why was Grandpa Yu so impulsive?</p><p>“Blood World Pearl!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen suddenly realized something. This must be the thing that Hallmaster Dao had always told her to be wary of.</p><p>However, it was too late to salvage the situation, the damage was done.</p><p>“Demi-Saint Ye!”</p><p>“Master Siren!”</p><p>“Elder Fang, Elder Zhong, help protect them!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen called out the names of the four Saints simultaneously. When the four Saints turned around, she took out a drop of Holy Blood.</p><p>She bit the tip of her tongue again, and her hands formed a blood seal between her eyebrows.</p><p>“Separate!”</p><p>With a whoosh, clouds and mist rose above Jade Capital City.</p><p>The people who trembled under the suppression of the Holy Energy looked up into the distance and saw the clouds in the sky that rapidly transformed into a…</p><p>Sea of stars?</p><p>It was a blue sea of stars!</p><p>Amid the hazy mist, a shy and gentle mermaid was released along with the Holy Power.</p><p>Her hair was slightly curly and light gold in color, and it swayed under the starlight, as it highlighted her slender swan-like neck. It slid over her fragrant white shoulders and fell behind her slim waist.</p><p>Her upper body was naked, and her chest was covered with a pearl-like clam shell. Her lower limbs were like the slender body of a fish and covered with scales that glittered on her body and was faintly visible in the sea of stars.</p><p>Her Pearl Gem Star Eyes concealed everything, but she immediately activated the power of her Holy Blood and sacred physique to the extreme and it exploded in a burst of starlight!</p><p>“Xuanji great array, activate!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
