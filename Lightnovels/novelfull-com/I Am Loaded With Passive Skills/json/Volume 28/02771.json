They are fighting for the fame, right?”</p><p>“But the Northern Sword Deity’s ranking is higher than Lord Shou’s. Why would she lower herself to challenge him? This doesn’t seem to be in line with the rules.”</p><p>“Don’t talk nonsense if you don’t understand. If it’s not against the rules, then you can challenge it. It’s just that no one had ever challenged someone who’s lower than them.”</p><p>“I know! I agree! I’ve also heard that the rules of the competition between the Seven Sword Deity state that anyone who fights for the sake of fame must abandon all other Taoist techniques; this included the Spiritual Cultivation and, of course, Power of Demons and Beasts. The competition is purely based on the strength of the Ancient Sword Technique. This Northern Sword Deity is wise!”</p><p>“Heh, she might have ulterior motives. This little Beibei is too evil. Not only did she want to limit our Lord Shou’s combat strength, but she arranged to meet him three days later. It’s obvious she’s stalling for time!”</p><p>“Oh? Brother Zhu? What are your thoughts on this?”</p><p>“Three days later, perhaps the people of the Holy Divine Palace will bring reinforcements from the god slayer ruins… Didn’t Lord Shou make a guess that Lord Cangsheng was trapped in the ruins? They’re probably gathering their people now and need to rely on the ancient swordsman’s battle to stall for time…”</p><p>“Hiss! Brother Zhu is indeed brilliant!”</p><p>“It’s no big deal. We can see through it, but Lord Shou’s vision is even clearer”</p><p>High up in the sky, Xu Xiaoshou could easily read Beibei’s mind.</p><p>He pointed at the girl and turned to look at Lei Xi’er and the others behind him and he was amused.</p><p>“She must be joking.”</p><p>Beibei’s expression froze.</p><p>She was serious! The ancient swordsman was also serious!</p><p>As an ancient swordsman, Xu Xiaoshou still held onto her invitation letter. This was an acceptance of the challenge.</p><p>However, he continued to tease her verbally. This was not serious at all!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, don’t you know that you’ve already agreed?” Lei Shuangxing suddenly said.</p><p>He knew Xu Xiaoshou’s personality.</p><p>This fellow had only learned the Ancient Sword Technique, but he was not a pure ancient swordsman. He did not fully understand the circle of ancient swordsman and the spirit of the ancient swordsman.</p><p>In this chaotic world, there was a group of people who had inherited the ‘chivalrous spirit’ that was passed down from ancient times. It seemed to be undesirable, but it created people with distinct personalities-these were the ancient swordsman.</p><p>The fame of the Seven Sword Deity was sacred to every pure ancient swordsman.</p><p>If there is a battle, we must fight.</p><p>We will always keep any appointment.</p><p>In just one short month, some ancient swordsman had to accept hundreds or even thousands of challenges.</p><p>As long as the situation permitted it, there would not be a situation like when Elder Gu went into seclusion and forgot about the world.</p><p>Even if the person who accepted the battle was exhausted to death.</p><p>From the perspective of most people in the world today, the chivalrous spirit of the ancient swordsman was a little redundant.</p><p>After all, if he was too straightforward, he would be easily exploited.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>How should he put it? He was in between the two.</p><p>He had learned the ‘good’ spirit of the ancient swordsman, but he ignored the ‘bad’ spirit.</p><p>This ‘bad’ was not really that ‘bad’.</p><p>He was tough, but also not tough at the same time. It depended on the situation.</p><p>He had pride, but at the same time he didn’t have pride. At least in this situation, he would definitely needed to be coaxed but not forced.</p><p>“Did I accept her challenge?”</p><p>As expected, Xu Xiaoshou turned around and said angrily, “I didn’t even say anything. How could I have accepted her challenge? What kind of rule is this?”</p><p>Lei Shuangxing shook his head. “Since you’ve accepted the invitation letter, you’re deemed to have accepted the challenge. This isn’t just a rule of the Feng Clan. It’s also an established custom among the ancient swordsman.”</p><p>“She threw it over! I just wanted to see what was written inside…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou mumbled and opened the invitation letter.</p><p>He scanned through it and found that the contents were almost identical to what Beibei had said.</p><p>But it had to be said that it was really formal!</p><p>The invitation letter was made of thin bronze and its texture felt very good.</p><p>There was a sword tower embossed on its surface, but there was no human figure on it. There were only two crossed swords, that represented the battle at the peak under the Sword God’s testimony.</p><p>When he flipped it open, he could see that the words on the invitation letter were square, bold and unyielding. Its form was full and spirited and the words seemed to jump off the paper.</p><p>From the decorative patterns at the edges, the honorific title at the beginning, the words used in the writing, the gilded signature at the end, the stamp, and the personal sword mark and aura left behind by Beibei… All of them expressed formality, courtesy and respect.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could almost see Beibei as she sat on the chair and wrote this on the table, her lips pursed in concentration.</p><p>He was a little surprised.</p><p>He folded the invitation letter and aimed it at Beibei.</p><p>When he saw the little girl’s angry expression and a hint of humiliation in her eyes, Xu Xiaoshou could not help but be moved.</p><p>She was too serious!</p><p>To be honest…</p><p>From the very beginning, Xu Xiaoshou was not the least interested in Beibei, let alone have a gentleman’s duel with her.</p><p>This could be seen from his ‘attack of the heart’ and even how he berated the people and rules of the entire Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>He didn’t want to give Beibei and the Sacred Mountain any face. He just wanted to humiliate them.</p><p>As for the Southern Region…</p><p>The Feng Clan of the Southern Region might be ranked, but the Seven Sword Deity were the Seven Sword Deity. Xu Xiaoshou didn’t care about them at all!</p><p>He believed that he had relied on his strength to get onto the rankings.</p><p>When he obtained the title of ‘Number One Sword Deity’ in the future, the value of this generation’s Seven Sword Deity would also rise because of his existence.</p><p>Naturally, the honor of the fame of the Seven Sword Deity ‘Lord Shou’ would belong to the Feng family of the Southern Region, not Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>But…</p><p>The ancient swordsman’s understanding of this battle seemed different from his.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
