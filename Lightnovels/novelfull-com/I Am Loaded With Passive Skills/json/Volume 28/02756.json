Lei Xi’er is the last survivor of the Lei family. She isn’t looking at the Hallmaster Xuanji. Instead, she’s looking at Path Division Chief Yu Zhiwen…Wait!”</p><p>“She’s focused on the Pearl Gem Star Eyes?”</p><p>A chill ran down everyone’s spines as they realized what was happening.</p><p>At that moment, the world’s attention was undoubtedly on the two peerless beauties in the sky, each with contrasting temperaments.</p><p>Elder Yu gripped his great-granddaughter’s hand tightly, his old face knotted in tension.</p><p>But Yu Zhiwen didn’t look at him. Instead, she kept her gaze fixed on the woman with the God Devil Eyes in the distance.</p><p>“Don’t go!” Elder Yu urged.</p><p>“I have to go,” Yu Zhiwen replied softly.</p><p>“None of this matters, this isn’t your…”</p><p>“My what? My fault?”</p><p>“No! Uh, that’s not what I meant…”</p><p>“Grandpa Yu, I have a very important question that needs an answer.”</p><p>“If you come with me now, I can give you any answer you want!”</p><p>“But…” Yu Zhiwen turned her head, smiling even as tears glistened in her eyes. “I don’t believe you anymore.”</p><p>“Little Yu!”</p><p>Elder Yu reached out to grab her.</p><p>But Yu Zhiwen shook off his hand, rising into the sky, falling into the gaze of thousands—the scene she had once feared the most.</p><p>…</p><p>“Watched, Passive Points +9999.”</p><p>“Expected, Passive Points +9999.”</p><p>“Revered, Passive Points +9999.”</p><p>The Information Bar kept popping up notifications.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned. He felt more annoyed than ever before. He wondered if this dumb Information Bar could ever stop.</p><p>Looking to the left, Lei Xi’er’s silver hair fluttered slightly, the light from her God Devil Eyes icy cold.</p><p>Looking to the right, Yu Zhiwen’s eyes were calm, but the hands hidden in her sleeves trembled, causing ripples in her clothing.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s head started to ache!</p><p>He had once guessed this might happen.</p><p>He had even fantasized about this moment.</p><p>But now that it was real, he realized he was utterly unprepared. He didn’t know how to handle this situation.</p><p>“Leave…”</p><p>A voice came weakly from the demonic energy’s cloud behind her—it was Dao Xuanji.</p><p>Even now, her tone carried a hint of command, “Little Yu… I order you to leave this place…”</p><p>“Shut the hell up!” Xu Xiaoshou spun around, ready to shout in anger.</p><p>But at that moment, he saw Dao Xuanji’s eyes filled with struggle. The only emotions emanating from her boiling soul were nervousness and worry.</p><p>“Leave…”</p><p>“Shut up!” Xu Xiaoshou shouted.</p><p>“Xu…” Yu Zhiwen stretched out her hand, but she did not dare to pull on Xu Xiaoshou’s clothes, only grasping at the air. Her Pearl Gem Star Eyes were filled with a pleading look. “She is my Supreme Master…”</p><p>“You’re courting death!” Elder Yu couldn’t take it anymore. He spread his wings and leaped into the air, his claws grabbing at the void.</p><p>As soon as he moved, Zhong Yuanzi and Fang Wenxin followed suit.</p><p>Just as the two Saints from the Holy Divine Palace were about to act, Xu Xiaoshou, Ye Xiaotian, and Mei Siren, who were holding the line, also prepared to move.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen knew the consequences of an all-out Saint war and could only close her eyes, shouting in a trembling voice, “Everyone, stop!”</p><p>Elder Yu flapped his wings and changed direction, grabbing Fang Wenxin and Zhong Yuanzi on the spot. He furiously shouted, “Are you trying to get us all killed? Do you want to destroy the entire city? I’ve been talking about you all from the beginning!”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi and Fang Wenxin were petrified on the spot.</p><p>The entire arena fell silent, and even in Jade Capital City, the sound of a pin drop could be heard.</p><p>The spectators didn’t even dare to shuffle their feet, fearing they might step on a broken branch and make a sound.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s Pearl Gem Star Eyes trembled slightly. She tried to remain calm as she looked at Dao Xuanji, who was surrounded by devilish energy, and asked in a sorrowful voice, “Supreme Master, I want to ask you…”</p><p>“Do I have Lei family blood?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath of the Fourth Sword’s demonic aura.</p><p>Dao Xuanji, having waited for this opportunity, glared coldly and charged straight at Lei Xi’er!</p><p>“God’s Fall…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er didn’t even have time to react.</p><p>But suddenly, a figure appeared in front of her. She spread her arms wide and stood defenseless, shielding herself.</p><p>Dao Xuanji could only pull back at the last moment, suffering a backlash and spitting out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s fury surged to its peak. He raised his Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand and shouted, “Dao Xuanji, you’re courting death!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen, with a sorrowful expression, reached out and grabbed at the air, “Don’t hurt her anymore, Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>“Pleaded. Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath, deliberately avoiding looking at Yu Zhiwen. He even shifted the focus of his Perception to the other side of the world.</p><p>He didn’t dare to look.</p><p>His only concern was Lei Xi’er’s safety, but he stepped back, allowing these three women to take over the battlefield.</p><p>At this moment, he stood only on the side of his little junior sister and the only true family member he had met in this lifetime. He wouldn’t soften his resolve!</p><p>Dao Xuanji stopped in front of Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>She no longer looked at Lei Xi’er, who possessed the God Devil Eyes and Ultimate Life Demon Physique.</p><p>With trembling hands and pained eyes filled with tenderness and heartache, Dao Xuanji seemed as if she wanted to cup Yu Zhiwen’s face and wipe away her tears.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was about to strike, but Dao Xuanji suddenly stopped. She realized that the demonic aura of the Fourth Sword within her was too much for Yu Zhiwen to bear.</p><p>“Sigh…”</p><p>Under everyone’s gaze, the once-dignified Hallmaster Xuanji, now tainted by madness and despair, no longer had any trace of her former authority.</p><p>She shook her head and sighed. She said in the tone of a relative and elder, doting with a hint of criticism, “Silly child, you do indeed have Lei family blood…”</p><p>“The Pearl Gem Star Eyes are yours. What are you doubting?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
