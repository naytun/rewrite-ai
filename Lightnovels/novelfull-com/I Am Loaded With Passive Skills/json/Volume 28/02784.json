It’s not just that!”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui, spitting excitedly, answered his own question, “The majority of my Feng family practice the Ten Thousand Sword Technique, and it definitely doesn’t have this effect, this is the influence of the Supreme Emperor Sword!”</p><p>Feng Tingchen looked over with a gloomy face.</p><p>Feng Zhongzui’s passion faltered for a moment, he quickly turned the mirror towards him, and countered, “Family head, did I say anything wrong?”</p><p>Feng Tingchen’s expression suddenly appeared much improved, though in reality it became even uglier.</p><p>“You’re not wrong,” Mei Siren glanced over and said, “You do know quite a bit.”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui was overjoyed, as if he had received the greatest encouragement, and rattled off:</p><p>“Supreme Emperor Sword, the sword that resonates most with the Ten Thousand Sword Technique.”</p><p>“The more auxiliary swords it has, the stronger the power it can release!”</p><p>“My Feng family has schemed… no, dreamed for so long to acquire this sword, and today it is finally seen to be in perfect harmony with the ancient swordsmen.”</p><p>“If I’m not mistaken, Sword Deity Bei will use the Supreme Emperor Sword to exert power over all the other swords to enhance her own… Here it comes!”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui may have been a blabbermouth, but his perspective on swords was extremely precise.</p><p>Just as his words fell, a suppressive and fascinating sound emitted from the Supreme Emperor Sword above Beibei’s head:</p><p>“I command the worship of thousands of swords, my sword alone reigns supreme!”</p><p>This command seemed to come from the ancient past, seemingly from the sword itself, but in actuality, it manifested from Bei’s voice, turning intangible into substance.</p><p>At the moment of conclusion, a golden dragon’s shadow leapt from the sword.</p><p>All the famed and spiritual swords present had a portion of their power siphoned and integrated into it.</p><p>As the sky was sprinkled with golden light, the shadow of the golden dragon dove back into Beibei, dyeing her white clothes with noble gold, as if crowning her head with an invisible crown.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Void sword energy ran wild, and all swords in Jade Capital City bowed.</p><p>Feng Zhongzui knew the effect; he zoomed the image out, focusing on the surging tide of sword energy.</p><p>…</p><p>Throughout the five regions, in front of all the Dao Imparting Mirrors.</p><p>“This guy sure talks a lot…”</p><p>“Can you Feng family folks send a message to hush him up a bit?”</p><p>Many were still berating the incessantly noisy Feng Zhongzui, but as the image in the mirror changed, revealing a figure dyed in prestigious gold, they fell silent.</p><p>The figure passed quickly through the frame, then slowed down as it moved toward the sword in Sword Deity Bei’s hand, now transmuted by the golden sheen.</p><p>“The Emperor Sword!”</p><p>The sword was painted gold from hilt to tip.</p><p>From the sword guard, with its imposing and angry golden patterns…</p><p>To the duel-edged hilt with embedded dragon patterns, exuding a palpable killing intent—the eight-sided sword body…</p><p>It had the dignity of an emperor while possessing the unspoken authority of one—especially now that the Supreme Emperor Sword was unsheathed!</p><p>The viewers covered their faces in shock and retreated, because the sword in the mirror appeared as though it would shatter the mirror and emerge.</p><p>The Dao Imparting Mirror can convey many things.</p><p>Aside from impact and injuries of the scene, Sword Will, sword energy, and sword power could be transmitted almost entirely through the mirror.</p><p>At that moment, in front of the Burial Sword Tomb, Demon Sword Myriad Weapons Devil Lord, Blood Sword The Bewitching Demon, the Demon Sword Voice of Nulan at Half-Moon Bay, the Kongtong Formless Sword in Fringe Moon Immortal City…</p><p>Nearly all notable swords stirred.</p><p>Those before the mirror were yet to subdue their unease.</p><p>The image in the mirror zoomed in as Sword Deity Bei, now wielding the Supreme Emperor Sword, coldly aimed a sword at Xu Xiaoshou and Hidden Bitter.</p><p>“Absolute Imperial Control, submit!”</p><p>A thunderous sound reverberated, and the world within the mirror rippled, unleashing waves of golden tide that nearly drowned those before the mirror, leaving them gasping for air.</p><p>It wasn’t an illusion!</p><p>That aura truly crossed the distance, left people floating like adrift weeds, teetering on the brink of capsizing.</p><p>“What kind of swordsmanship is this?”</p><p>“Is this the effect of Absolute Imperial Control? Isn’t it just a suppressive force?”</p><p>“Damn it, why isn’t Feng Zhongzui speaking now? He keeps blabbering when he shouldn’t, and stays silent when it’s time to talk…”</p><p>After a brief pause, an overexcited voice rang out:</p><p>“The Sea Path, the sea is boundless!”</p><p>“Ladies and gentlemen, you’re not mistaken, this is one of the most supreme among the 3000 Sword Styles…”</p><p>…</p><p>Absolute Imperial Control?</p><p>The Sea Path, boundless sea?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, standing on the Way of the Sword Disc, gobbled up the “knowledge” that he had once digested like a Taotie beast, insatiable and ravenous.</p><p>He didn’t activate the Field of Profound Dao or Profound Dao Seed for self-improvement with the Mang Sword Way Upanishad Array.</p><p>Because he realized that his own level of swordsmanship was already not low.</p><p>Beibei’s sword strokes indeed borrowed the Force of the Supreme Emperor Sword and were powerful, but they were not invincible.</p><p>As soon as she made her move, and with some explanation from Feng Zhongzui, Xu Xiaoshou understood.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
