At least she knew how to interact with people in the most basic way.</p><p>After she looked around, she looked at the person on the main seat and saw that this was the person with the highest status. She said.</p><p>“Your people said that Xu Xiaoshou could be caught here?”</p><p>Dao Xuanji suppressed the strange thoughts in her heart, but she could not hide the expression in her eyes.</p><p>She had indeed asked someone to summon Li Fuyu because everyone knew that Li Fuyu had entered the city.</p><p>If she wanted to defeat Xu Xiaoshou, she would naturally need as many people as she could find.</p><p>But summoning Li Fuyu was just a casual move.</p><p>It was so casual that even Dao Xuanji didn’t know who was sent to summon her and how they had invited her.</p><p>She also did not know that Li Fuyu’s background was so terrifying. In fact, she had heard of the sword tower Li Fuyu, but who dared to think that this sword tower was actually that renowned sword tower?</p><p>There were a lot of Bazhun’ans that could be easily found on the streets, and eleven out of ten of them were fake. After all, even the pregnant ones dared to pretend to be him.</p><p>It was too normal the way that a sword tower just happened to suddenly pop out!</p><p>Unexpectedly, a real sword tower Sword Human had returned, and she had even brought out the Sword God’s former saber…</p><p>A willow tree that was unintentionally planted grew into a shady tree!</p><p>Dao Xuanji felt like she was in a dream, and it felt so unreal.</p><p>Her first reaction was that Xu Xiaoshou was no longer important. Her priority now was to keep this woman at the Sacred Mountain Guizhe.</p><p>But it seemed like…</p><p>She seemed to be only interested in Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Why was it that everything was related to Xu Xiaoshou? Dao Xuanji frowned inwardly, but she quickly calmed down. “Have a seat.”</p><p>Gu Yu and Li Fuyu took their seats.</p><p>For the first time, the seats in the Council of Ten of the Holy Divine Palace welcomed an owner who was not part of them.</p><p>Dao Xuanji looked around and said calmly.</p><p>“You are both interested in Xu Xiaoshou. He is also one of the Seven Sword Deity. For the sake of fame, he will also challenge you, one after the other.”</p><p>“This is what I think. There is no time like the present.”</p><p>“It just so happened that there is a ghost beast that besieged Jade Capital City and its force has overwhelmed the city. If you can challenge Xu Xiaoshou to a duel in the way of the ancient swordsman, defeat him or take him down, it will be considered a great achievement.”</p><p>“The Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe welcomes everyone and hope they will stay.”</p><p>As she said this, Dao Xuanji sized up Li Fuyu’s expression out of the corner of her eye.</p><p>Unfortunately, this woman just sat upright, and there was no emotion on her face, not even the slightest movement or expression.</p><p>Her posture was neutral, neither open nor closed; she neither resisted nor accepted, as if she had no interest in the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>As she paused for a moment, Dao Xuanji looked at Gu Yu.</p><p>“We happen to have a vacancy in the Council of Ten. There are vacancies in the Three Emperors and the four Divine envoys; It is not just one seat.”</p><p>“If anyone can take down Xu Xiaoshou’s main body, you can take over as the owner of this seat.”</p><p>Gu Yu lowered his head and smiled when he heard that. He shook his head and declined politely.</p><p>“The positions of the Three Emperors and four divine envoys are too important and formal for me. It is out of my reach and I can’t adapt to them.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is definitely not just any ordinary person. He mastered his swordsmanship from Bazhun’an and Siren. He can’t be taken down that easily.”</p><p>As he spoke, he raised his head and sighed. “If I can defeat him, I don’t want anything else. I just want a semi-saint person.”</p><p>Sanctification was too difficult!</p><p>To ordinary people, it was as difficult as ascending to the heavens!</p><p>Sky City was an opportunity that could only be encountered by chance.</p><p>When Gu Yu heard about it and rushed over, the city gates were wide open as they had invited all the Spiritual Cultivators in the world.</p><p>For a wily old fox, this sounded like a trap.</p><p>For the sake of his life, Gu Yu naturally passed up the opportunity offered by Sky City. He chose to rely on the normal way to obtain the opportunity to become a demi-saint.</p><p>As for what the normal route was…</p><p>Gu Yu had a friend called Mei Siren.</p><p>He roamed around the world and cultivated his sword skills. He had no fixed Occupied Void and had never joined any faction. He was more like a wanderer than himself.</p><p>The reason why he was able to obtain the semi-saint person and dared to undergo sanctification on Abyss Island was because he was once known as the Seven Sword Deity. He was invited by the Holy Divine Palace to pass down his sword skills to the five Great Holy Emperor aristocratic families!</p><p>Whatever was said and done were legitimate.</p><p>Mei Siren could progress from being a Sword Deity to a sword saint… It was all due to time and accumulation through normal means!</p><p>At this time, Gu Yu had no way out and could not advance an inch.</p><p>After he obtained the title of the new Seven Sword Deity, he was naturally tempted. He had the ability and wanted to improve.</p><p>Naturally, he would seek out the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>However, at this critical juncture, the Holy Divine Palace had a change in leadership; it lost a lot of members and experienced all sorts of problems. It was obviously not secure at this moment.</p><p>Gu Yu wanted to walk the path of Mei Siren, not Gou Wuyue.</p><p>He didn’t want to waste hundreds of years after he joined the Holy Divine Palace. He didn’t want to be left with only one arm when he left the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>Of course, he knew that he would never receive the same treatment as Mei Siren.</p><p>After all, the latter was passively invited, while he was the one who took the initiative.</p><p>If he really accepted Dao Xuanji’s gift, it would be difficult for him to leave even if he wanted to, but that was a story for the future.</p><p>If he did not undergo sanctification…</p><p>Gu Yu looked back at the cold wind and snow outside the Saint Hall.</p><p>He lagged behind You Tu and Mei Siren, by a big gap, too big a gap…</p><p>He would always be mediocre if he did not fight for it.</p><p>It was either win or lose a fight or die or be injured.</p><p>However, he had worked hard and had no regrets in this life.</p><p>“Of course.” Dao Xuanji nodded calmly. I will not go back on my word.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
