Despite her dislike for his Supreme Master’s personality and the immense pressure her Supreme Master had put on her… in the end, she was still her Supreme Master!</p><p>She had raised Yu Zhiwen from a young age, taught her the Divine Secret, and guided her life’s direction.</p><p>But…</p><p>Could she blame Xu Xiaoshou for this?</p><p>Under such immense pressure, two extremes were bound to emerge!</p><p>Dao Xuanji failed to make Yu Zhiwen as heartless as she was. On the contrary, her disciple went to the opposite extreme.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s sympathy was overwhelming.</p><p>Just by seeing her Supreme Master’s current suffering, she could feel the same pain Xu Xiaoshou had endured in the Eight Palaces that day!</p><p>One was pierced by a sword, the other by an arrow.</p><p>One was tainted by demonic aura, the other by the power of evil.</p><p>The outcome was the same. Both Supreme Masters were powerless to resist and could only be slaughtered.</p><p>Elder Sang was also Xu Xiaoshou’s Supreme Master!</p><p>How much effort had Xu Xiaoshou put in to reach this point? It was evident to all.</p><p>“The Struggle for the Great Path…”</p><p>Hallmaster Dao, Supreme Master, Grandpa Yu, and the various seniors in the Path Division spoke extensively, but Yu Zhiwen felt that their words were very distant.</p><p>Experiencing it firsthand today, she finally understood why everyone said the Struggle for the Great Path was brutal and the battle for the robbing path was bloody.</p><p>Different positions, different paths, different defenders…</p><p>Those who achieve their goals were never delicate flowers nurtured in a greenhouse. They were always those who had fought through bloody storms and licked blood from their blades!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen had been protected too well.</p><p>Her life had been full of tests and training.</p><p>From Dongtinawang City to the Yunlun Mountain Range, from the Four Symbols Secret Realm to Qingyuan Mountain…</p><p>Even when taking on a significant role as the Chief of the Path Division, she felt independent and mature.</p><p>Everything she did, under the arrangements of the Hallmaster Dao, avoided confrontation and minimal impact.</p><p>Even setting up an array on Qingyuan Mountain seemed pointless and unclear in purpose. It might not have even needed her involvement. It was perhaps just to give people a sense of participation…</p><p>What kind of impact could she have received?</p><p>Now that the protective umbrella of the great tree had been removed, and with Hallmaster Dao gone, Yu Zhiwen had to face this bloody world directly.</p><p>The overwhelming shock shattered her psychological defenses again and again, with no one to shield her eyes or block the impact.</p><p>Thus, the floodwaters that had been dammed up for half a lifetime surged forth like a burst dam.</p><p>She felt like rootless duckweed, instantly swaying and shattering.</p><p>Drowning, suffocation, depression, collapse… all sorts of emotions and mixed feelings came flooding in.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s vision blurred, and she staggered, nearly collapsing to the ground.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>Elder Yu appeared with a swoosh, catching his dazed great-granddaughter just in time. When he looked up and saw the confrontation between Dao Xuanji and Xu Xiaoshou, he began to understand.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
