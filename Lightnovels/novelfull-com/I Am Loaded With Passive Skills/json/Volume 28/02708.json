This would have tarnished the awe-inspiring image of “Lord Shou”.</p><p>Furthermore, this was when he was about to become famous after slaying Dao Xuanji.</p><p>When he raised his left hand and clenched it into a fist above his head, as if he had grasped the world’s force, the Fire Path Wheel under Xu Xiaoshou’s feet began to spin.</p><p>“Dragon Melting Realm.”</p><p>His indifferent voice drifted in all directions.</p><p>White flames rose from the collapsed spatial fragments and gathered into a realm. On the top of the Jade Capital, it turned into a dazzling scene like the white sun descending into the world.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The Blood Shadow copper coin was the first to be thrown in the air, and it gradually became larger as it moved forward.</p><p>Fang Wenxin did not like Dao Xuanji, but she was still the current Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace. It would be too humiliating for Xu Xiaoshou to kill her with one sword.</p><p>This was not just damaging Dao Xuanji, but also the reputation of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>The supreme leader of the continent’s number one faction was killed by a small fry from an underground faction. If word got out, would people not laugh their heads off?</p><p>However, this conclusion of this matter was already set. The current plan did not seek to turn things around, but to minimize the negative impact.</p><p>After all, there were casualties in battle everywhere.</p><p>If the Holy Divine Palace won in the end and Dao Xuanji returned, the storm would be minimized.</p><p>The temperature in Dragon Melting Realm was extremely high.</p><p>Blood Shadow copper coin crashed into Xu Xiaoshou’s head, but he did not move. Therefore, he was not fighting alone.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit, who was no longer suppressed by his owner, had been freed in the battle just now.</p><p>It looked around and saw that there were no more chains to restrain it. It wanted to take revenge on the human who had stepped on its head, but it suddenly saw the Blood Shadow copper coin flying over, and the unbearable memories in its mind suddenly came back to life.</p><p>This thing had captured him before!</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>After a long roar, the space under his feet rippled. Greedy the Cat Spirit leaped up and caught the Blood Shadow copper coin in his mouth at the critical moment.</p><p>The huge resonance force brought its huge body to the horizon, and even its canine teeth seemed to be about to collapse.</p><p>However, after devouring Xu Xiaoshou’s second true body, Greedy the Cat Spirit’s physical strength increased greatly.</p><p>It sucked in all the remnants of the Xuanji Star Official and the remnants of the Power of Divinity that had been destroyed in the battle into its stomach.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>In an instant, Blood Shadow copper coin was bitten by the Greedy the Cat Spirit!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Fang Wenxin felt a chill down her spine as she looked at the huge ghost beast that was emitting a faint Power of Divinity.</p><p>Body of Devour was too terrifying!</p><p>No matter how fast other ghost beasts grew, they still needed a certain amount of time.</p><p>Ghost beast, Greedy the Cat Spirit, could eat casually in battle. Even if it was some leftovers or cold food, it could improve after digesting it.</p><p>As this goes on, one side would become more and more tired, while it would grasp more and more abilities…</p><p>In the end, even the three Saints might not be able to withstand it!</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>With the Blood Shadow copper coin in his mouth, Greedy the Cat Spirit swung his head again, and the copper coin was blown into the spatial fragments.</p><p>When it reappeared, it had already smashed in front of Fang Wenxin’s face with a huge force.</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>Before Fang Wenxin could move, Elder Yu stepped into the air and reached out with one hand.</p><p>With a mere human body and the power of his five fingers, he managed to grab Blood Shadow copper coin, which had been enlarged to almost match the size of the Greedy the Cat Spirit and had the Power of Divinity!</p><p>“Woo-”</p><p>The Nine Heavens Kun’s song was melodious and soul-stirring.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit was dazed for a moment. When he came back to his senses, he saw that the human Elder Yu was holding a huge Blood Shadow Copper coin that did not match his size. It was not even his weapon.</p><p>A vicious blow was aimed at his head as if he had teleported.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>This smash destroyed the Path Principles.</p><p>With just one move, Greedy the Cat Spirit was hammered into the spatial fragments from the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>Elder Yu was clearly furious.</p><p>For some reason, his anger suddenly soared!</p><p>After beating Greedy the Cat Spirit, he was still not satisfied. He followed up with a stinky foot and kicked the head of the huge ghost beast.</p><p>“…”</p><p>The spatial fragment could not transmit messages.</p><p>The spatial storm exploded and the debris was penetrated.</p><p>From the spatial fragments, Greedy the Cat Spirit was kicked into the time fragment again.</p><p>Being stuck there, it had already raised its head and roared, struggling to escape.</p><p>In the next moment, he appeared at the Southern Zone’s entrance, in a state of confinement.</p><p>After a while, he returned to the spatial fragment, returned to Elder Yu’s feet, and was kicked into the time fragment.</p><p>Time became chaotic and space changed.</p><p>The two strikes had trapped the Greedy the Cat Spirit in the cracks of the spacetime fragments.</p><p>“Let’s not bother about it for now!”</p><p>After briefly strangling the irrational Greedy the Cat Spirit, Elder Yu threw the Blood Shadow copper coin back to Fang Wenxin.</p><p>He glanced at the Southern Zone’s wall and looked back at Xu Xiaoshou. He rolled up his sleeves and said,</p><p>“Beat this kid up first!”</p><p>Fang Wenxin looked at the furious Elder Yu, then lowered her eyes to look at her own Blood Shadow copper coin. She was confused for a moment.</p><p>Was this not…</p><p>This seems to be my weapon?</p><p>Also, you’re not from Xuanji Faction. Is there a need to be so angry?</p><p>…</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>On the other hand, the formation of the Dragon Melting Realm was not to evaporate all the demi-saints inside. It was impossible.</p><p>It was to complement the spatial attribute!</p><p>With a shout, the Inner and Outer Realms were exiled.</p><p>At this point, Dao Xuanji could undergo thousands of Transformations. Her body only belonged to the Dragon Melting Realm, and nothing from the Outer Realm could enter.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit was beaten up…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not help at all.</p><p>While he was shocked by Elder Yu’s astonishing combat strength, he seized the opportunity to ignite all the Star Path Principles and the Divine Path Principles in the Dragon Melting Realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
