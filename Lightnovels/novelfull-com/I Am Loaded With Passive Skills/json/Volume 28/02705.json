This should have been her first battle to make a name for herself.</p><p>However, her hand was torn off by Xu Xiaoshou in an instant!</p><p>“Blood…”</p><p>On the Southern Zone wall, Yu Zhiwen looked at the Supreme Master’s body that was out of control and could not help but send her sword toward the tip of Fourth Sword.</p><p>All attention fell on the Holy blood that was spilling out from the broken arm.</p><p>Jade gold blood!</p><p>It was crystal clear and clear, and it contained endless power.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen circulated her spirit source and shouted.</p><p>It was unknown if she was worried about Supreme Master’s broken arm or if she was thinking about something else.</p><p>“Received notification. Passive Points,+1.”</p><p>The Information Bar appeared.</p><p>Fourth Sword had yet to pierce Dao Xuanji’s head. Xu Xiaoshou’s expression changed and he looked down as if he had sensed something.</p><p>“Buzz, buzz, buzz…”</p><p>The drops of jade-gold Holy blood under his feet lit up with small but complicated divine path patterns.</p><p>With a cracking sound, the Holy blood split open, and young human-shaped things hatched from it.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>These little things suddenly expanded in size, each turning into a Divine Puppet that was thirty feet in size.</p><p>It was very different from the appearance of Divine Oracle Number 2. The Divine Puppet hatched from Dao Xuanji’s Holy blood was covered in a thin starry gauze. Its body was curvaceous and more feminine.</p><p>Their skin was snow-white, and they had three pairs of wings on their backs. They were also transformed from starlight illusion, and they were very beautiful.</p><p>As soon as they appeared, the 26 pure Divine Puppets disappeared.</p><p>“What is this?” Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. “A female Divine Puppet?”</p><p>An explosion sounded beside him.</p><p>Before they could see who was attacking, Cao Erzhu’s body suddenly arched like a prawn, as if he had been sent flying by a kick.</p><p>“Boom! Boom!”</p><p>As he tore through the air, various explosion sounds came from his body, and he made all kinds of extremely distorted movements.</p><p>Either he was kicked until he vomited and has his tongue hanging out…</p><p>Or be punched until his waist was folded in half, and his fingertips could even touch his toes…</p><p>Some of them had just raised their knees to block the invisible enemy’s attack when they were punched in the back…</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu grunted and swallowed back the blood he almost spat out.</p><p>His father had said that the blood of a Spiritual Cultivator was very precious and that one should never spit it out during a battle, because one would never know what the enemy could do with it.</p><p>The surface of his body was covered with a layer that looked extremely faint and a thin layer of God Punishment Tribulation. However, the layer was in fact extremely condensed.</p><p>That invisible Divine Puppet was too powerful!</p><p>If not for this layer of defense blocking nearly 90% of the damage…</p><p>If it was someone else, Cao Erzhu would feel that those few hits just now would have caused him to disintegrate!</p><p>However, as his thoughts slipped…</p><p>He had been hammered from the middle of the Arena to a thousand miles away!</p><p>“Brother Xiao Shou…”</p><p>…</p><p>“Divine Puppet!”</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators in Jade Capital City were all excited.</p><p>He had heard of the legendary Divine Puppet but he had never seen it before.</p><p>After all, those who had seen it were either captured or killed.</p><p>Now, Hallmaster Xuanji was facing off against the Saint Servant Lord Shou. Although he was injured in the first round, he was able to release so many Divine Puppets.</p><p>Although it was only for a moment, they had become invisible.</p><p>However, that short-lived beauty was deeply imprinted in everyone’s hearts.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is done for!”</p><p>“A total of 26 Divine Puppets. What is he going to use to fight them?”</p><p>“I’ve heard that the birth of Divine Spirits was created to counter Spiritual Cultivators. Each of them has the power to instantly kill someone with Sovereign (Stage) combat strength.”</p><p>“The top-notch Divine Puppets are also known as War Machines. It can be said that… It has no weaknesses!”</p><p>Unlike most who did not know Divine Secrets, Yu Zhiwen knew more as an outsider.</p><p>“Xuanji Star Official!”</p><p>This was the name that belonged to her Supreme Master Dao Xuanji’s Divine Puppet. They were all names that came after the eleventh generation of Divine Puppet.</p><p>Attack, defense, and speed were all maxed out.</p><p>Each of them had the combat strength of a higher void level.</p><p>Other than not having the same self-awareness as Number Two and being limited to not reaching the Saint Stage, all the other basic configurations could be said to be not inferior at all.</p><p>The 11th-generation Divine Puppet was a War Machine that possessed the ability to exterminate an entire race.</p><p>But that was a long time ago.</p><p>These Xuanji Star Officials were nourished with the Holy blood of their Supreme Master, Dao Xuanji, and improved in the days to come.</p><p>At this stage, Yu Zhiwen did not even know which version it was.</p><p>At the very least, the Xuanji Star Official in her impression did not have the ability to become invisible and could not deal with Penetrating Divine Senses.</p><p>However, the group who beat Cao Erzhu up just now had even secretly evolved their Holy Power!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen had never worried about her Supreme Master, Dao Xuanji, because she knew how powerful he was.</p><p>What she was afraid of was the 26 Xuanji Star Officials, the Xuanji great array, and the three demi-saints who were eyeing her covetously from behind…</p><p>Grandpa Yu was one of them!</p><p>How would Xu Xiaoshou fight?</p><p>One against many?</p><p>Could he do it?</p><p>“Received Concern, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>…</p><p>“Little chap!”</p><p>In a flash, Cao Erzhu was blasted out of the battlefield.</p><p>Fourth Sword had yet to land, and many messages popped up on the Information Bar.</p><p>“Locked on, Passive points +26.”</p><p>This number was just enough to match the number of female Divine Puppets.</p><p>But to make the Information respond…</p><p>Should it not be a creature with spiritual intelligence?</p><p>These female Divine Puppets actually all had intelligence, or perhaps they had the embryonic form of becoming true living beings?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
