Don’t you have any discernment?”</p><p>“With my strength, you’re making me a gatekeeper for the Seven Sword Deity? Do you want this generation’s Seven Sword Deity to not even make it through the door?”</p><p>Feng Tingchen was like a man getting an unearned scolding at home—dumbfounded and instinctively moved closer to Master Siren, “It wasn’t arranged by Feng someone, it was arranged by the Sword Pagoda…”</p><p>“Then tell your Feng family’s crappy Feng Sword Tower to open their eyes and rank again!” Xu Xiaoshou scolded Greedy the Cat Spirit while at it, cursing the Feng family too. He had been unhappy for a long time—who liked being ranked seventh?</p><p>Feng Zhongzui carefully explained, “The Sword Tower is a tower, not a person, it doesn’t have eyes…”</p><p>“If it doesn’t have eyes, then install a pair for it!”</p><p>Well, well, Lord Shou is really as Xiao Wanfeng described, a wonderful person… Feng Zhongzui glanced at the elder family head again, was about to stir the fire further when suddenly, he felt a chill down his spine and sensed murderous intent.</p><p>He didn’t dare to act rashly and quickly changed the topic, steering the interview back on track,</p><p>“Lord Shou, on behalf of the Five Domains Ancient Sword Cultivators, I want to ask you a question.”</p><p>“In the battle just now, that final sword, was it using the imagery of Heavenly Unravel from Present Gods and Buddhas of the Heart Sword Technique? Is there any experience you could share with us?”</p><p>“Meow!” Before Xu Xiaoshou could speak, the cat cried out first.</p><p>From completing the contract with Greedy the Cat Spirit to now, from dealing with Dao Xuanji to confronting the five regions of the continent…</p><p>He had endured for so long, and could no longer bear it!</p><p>“Wait a moment.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gestured with his hands to the mirror and his consciousness slipped into the spiritual world, lightly pulling.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The void exploded with a wave of air, and nine tails swept across.</p><p>His black hair was dyed white, and three blood marks appeared on his forehead, spreading ghostly energy throughout the air, filled with killing intent.</p><p>Ghost beast form?</p><p>Hearing a bit of the rumor earlier, Feng Zhongzui’s pupils tightened with shock, nearly backpedaling.</p><p>It was with great difficulty that he stopped his subconscious impulse, “Lo… Lord Shou?”</p><p>Lord Shou, with a face full of chilling intent, pointed at the Dao Imparting Mirror and said in a deep voice,</p><p>“Xu Yue Grey Palace, I know you’re watching.”</p><p>“I don’t care if it’s the war faction or the conservative faction, send someone over immediately to negotiate with my First Pavilion in the Sky.”</p><p>“After discussing the Ghost Beast and Ghost Beast Contract, we might possibly move on to the next step of cooperation. Otherwise, your Greedy the Cat Spirit is in my hands right now…”</p><p>He didn’t continue.</p><p>But Feng Zhongzui’s hand trembled, sensing something was amiss, and with a tingling scalp, he turned to look at the old family head behind him.</p><p>Feng Tingchen appeared utterly hopeless and finally closed his eyes heavily.</p><p>You can’t avoid it, you just can’t! Had been dodging for so long, yet with a single sentence from Xu Xiaoshou, the whole Feng family was sent into the game—linking the Saint Servant to the ghost beast affair for the whole world to see, wasn’t that a mistake?</p><p>Anything to do with the ghost beast was a mistake!</p><p>Or to say…</p><p>Was Lord Shou unintentional?</p><p>No! That kid was too shrewd.</p><p>Feng Tingchen had studied him and knew well this young man was out of the ordinary.</p><p>One could only say…</p><p>It was the trend of the times; when it was time for the calamity to come, who could truly escape unscathed?</p><p>In front of the Dao Imparting Mirror, the onlookers from the five regions were first stunned, then as if they had just hit upon some exciting news, they became thrilled.</p><p>The group watching wasn’t just Ancient Sword Cultivators. Compared to Spiritual Cultivators, swordsmen were a minority.</p><p>The majority of the people who enjoyed watching were the gossips, who were the most capable and also most fond of spreading hot topics of the moment!</p><p>Everyone was still immersed in the comical incident of Lord Shou mimicking a cat’s meow when suddenly, the tone changed drastically; Lord Shou dragged the stage up to global affairs.</p><p>He even emphasized in front of everyone the “cooperation” with Xu Yue Grey Palace, and had already contracted with something called “Greedy the Cat Spirit” from Xu Yue Grey Palace…</p><p>To say there wasn’t some relationship between his First Pavilion in the Sky and Xu Yue Grey Palace, the top ghost beast faction—all could disbelieve, but could the Holy Divine Palace pretend as if nothing ever happened?</p><p>Open conspiracy!</p><p>The astute could read from this single sentence by Lord Shou how Xu Yue Grey Palace was forcefully attached to his First Pavilion in the Sky’s chariot.</p><p>Those who couldn’t fathom this layer were still pondering the word “ghost beast”…</p><p>They heard touching this stuff could kill you?</p><p>Dying from hearing about it, too?</p><p>All bluff?</p><p>Up in Jade Capital City, Feng Zhongzui felt a chill in the air; while Lord Shou could make jokes, he himself found it hard to continue.</p><p>This scene was no longer suitable for a junior to stay; it was a bit terrifying.</p><p>Is this headed toward world war…?</p><p>Luckily, the old family head saw through the youngster’s embarrassment and flew over in time, grabbing the Dao Imparting Mirror from him.</p><p>Feng Zhongzui, like he had received amnesty, quickly backed away, then began to seriously observe and learn how the old family head managed to dodge the crisis urgently.</p><p>“Hehe, Lord Shou, we are now in the middle of the battle of the Seven Sword Deities, and the Dao Imparting Mirror is certainly facing the people, but there are some matters that we still need to deliberate upon…”</p><p>“Elder family head? That kid Feng Zhongzui, he calls you elder family head?”</p><p>“…Yes.”</p><p>“Alright, elder family head, are you now trying to restrict my freedom of speech?”</p><p>“Uh, no, the main thing is…”</p><p>“It’s not, so that’s settled. Since the Dao Imparting Mirror is already in use, just lend it for a while, what’s the fuss about being so stingy, eh, elder family head meow?”</p><p>“Hehe, alright, alright… The battle of the Seven Sword Deities is the focus, and we, the Feng family members, including the Dao Imparting Mirror, come secondary. As the saying goes, the guest follows the host’s lead, our Feng family won’t force it, we won’t force it…”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui saw the elder family head mopping up metaphorical sweat.</p><p>“No, no, no!”</p><p>Immediately after, Lord Shou embraced the elder family head and spoke as if they were old acquaintances who had known each other for a long time, “Elder family head, Feng Zhongzui is a friend of my life-threatening friend, Xiao Wanfeng. By this calculation, the Feng family is also a friend of Xu someone.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
