It was soft and slender, and green in color.</p><p>The willow branches swayed in the wind and messed up people’s minds.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>In an instant, it sucked away all the demonic aura around it and revealed its actual appearance.</p><p>It had taken root in Dao Xuanji’s chest and had absorbed all the nutrients for an unknown period of time. With the help of the demonic aura it swallowed, it had grown into a thick branch that was about ten feet long.</p><p>“Ha…”</p><p>Dao Xuanji let out a suppressed cry and her eyes suddenly opened.</p><p>The redness in her eyes faded, and at the same time, her expression turned ferocious. It was as if she had regained her consciousness.</p><p>At the same time, above the Nine Heavens, a merciless verdict was proclaimed.</p><p>“The Lei family secretly hatched a plot to destroy Abyss Island.”</p><p>“Members of the Holy Divine Palace, capture the descendants of the Lei family, Lei Shuangxing and Lei Xi’er immediately. No errors are allowed.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou has caused trouble in Jade Capital City. His crimes are unforgivable. Arrest him as well!”</p><p>Jade Capital City was in an uproar.</p><p>Hallmaster Xuanji had woken up?</p><p>When one glanced at her, her current state was extremely strange.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou and Greedy the Cat Spirit coexisted, there was still some semblance of beauty in their appearance.</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s entire body was slightly bloated and there was a thick, tail-like willow branch on her chest.</p><p>Her limbs were tangled up, and sharp thorns stuck out from her fingertips. Even the flesh on her face showed faint signs of roots that protruded through.</p><p>It was like a human-shaped petri dish that cultivated green willow seedlings on it!</p><p>Fang Wenxin, Zhong Yuanzi, and the others looked at each other.</p><p>The white and red-clothed people from the Holy Divine Palace who had gathered in the city for a long time were hesitant to speak.</p><p>Let alone the shock that the Lei family incident had brought to everyone.</p><p>At this time, whether to capture these Saint Servants was no longer the problem.</p><p>The problem was whether they could take down Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“Willow tree spirit?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned and was completely oblivious to Dao Xuanji’s nonsense.</p><p>Instead, he seemed to have discovered some shocking secret as he looked at Elder Yu and the other members of the Saint Hall in disbelief.</p><p>Before these people could explain, they heard Master Siren’s solemn voice.</p><p>“God Worship Willow Tree!”</p><p>Uh, did I get it wrong…</p><p>“The God Worship Willow Tree, the first of the Nine Great Ancestral Trees?” Xu Xiaoshou looked towards the source of the voice. “Didn’t it get hacked off by Elder You Tu?”</p><p>“It was hacked off, but it seemed that it had revived. Dao Xuanji used her… In other words, they used each other so they could grow together!” Mei Siren explained.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t ask anymore.</p><p>He already held the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff in his hand.</p><p>The next step should be child’s play, the reversal of time so everyone would forget the awkwardness just now…</p><p>As he stared at the willow branch and thought for a moment, Xu Xiaoshou stopped his actions.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>In just a breath’s time, the God Worship Willow Tree that had taken root in Dao Xuanji’s body and revived with her power, sprouted more willow branches as if a goddess scattered flowers about.</p><p>These willow branches had no consciousness.</p><p>Dao Xuanji, who controlled them, tilted her head back, and her eyes lost their sparkle.</p><p>Therefore…</p><p>Some of the willow branches that were out of control shot toward Ye Xiaotian, Mei Siren, and even the demi-saints of the Holy Divine Palace, such as Fang Wenxin and Zhong Yuanzi.</p><p>Some of them locked onto Lei Shuangxing, Lei Xi’er, and Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>Finally, they charged toward the ground in an attempt to enter Jade Capital City. To their great horror, they seemed to target the countless Spiritual Cultivators who were there.</p><p>“Too slow!”</p><p>This time, the strength of the explosion was too weak, and the attack speed was not as fast as everyone’s reaction speed.</p><p>After Ye Xiaotian slashed the willow branch in front of him, he concluded that none of the people present would be struck by the branches based on their strength.</p><p>He stepped out of the Spatial Upanishad array diagram and protected Jade Capital City.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The Saints just dodged to avoid the attacks.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing pulled out his Divine-beating Crutch and slashed through the branch of the God Worship Willow Tree with one strike.</p><p>Lei Xi’er only tilted her head, and the willow branch brushed past her ear, unable to hurt her at all.</p><p>“This is the Ancestral Tree…?”</p><p>Dao Xuanji was so weak and the God Worship Willow Tree was also weak, who could they battle against?</p><p>Lei Xi’er frowned and even had a trace of doubt. However, she was shocked to see that the God Worship Willow Tree’s branch had pierced through Xu Xiaoshou’s palm!</p><p>“Sizzle.”</p><p>It penetrated through his flesh and blood.</p><p>It should be an excruciating pain.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s God Devil Eyes spun, and her Ultimate Life Demon Physique appeared.</p><p>As she flew over, she slapped away the branch of the God Worship Willow Tree. “You can’t dodge it?”</p><p>“+(Doubted, Passive Points+) +1.”</p><p>She was not the only one. Everyone present turned their heads to look at her in disbelief.</p><p>Could it be that the one that targeted her was weak?</p><p>Dao Xuanji had gathered all her strength just to attack Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Otherwise, Xu Xiaoshou in his ghost beast form could even send Elder Yu flying. How could he not have avoided this sneak attack?</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Before Lei Xi’er could grab the God Worship Willow Tree branch, Xu Xiaoshou shouted at her to stop.</p><p>She looked over in shock and realized that this fellow did not look panicked at all. Instead, he had a slightly curious look…</p><p>Did he get stabbed on purpose?</p><p>“+(Cursed. Passive Points+) +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did it on purpose.</p><p>He had a set of passive skills and the ghost beast Greedy the Cat Spirit.</p><p>It could be said that he was not afraid of anything on Heaven or earth. Why would he be afraid of a mere God Worship Willow Tree that had just awakened?</p><p>Moreover…</p><p>It was the main body of the Ancestral Tree, the main body of the Dragon Apricot, who watched from afar.</p><p>How could Xu Xiaoshou lose?</p><p>Nothing ventured, nothing gained. He just wanted to test the ability of the head of the Ancestral Tree, the God Worship Willow Tree.</p><p>“Gulp, gulp, gulp…”</p><p>The willow branch that pierced through his palm wriggled.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that a large amount of blood essence in his body had been devoured.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
