Let them settle their matters.”</p><p>“You’re young, thinking and worrying too much will only cause yourself pain. The sins of others are not your sins, and their mistakes are not your faults.”</p><p>“Let the older generation handle the matters of the older generation…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou isn’t much older than me!” Yu Zhiwen sobbed. Only in front of her true family did she dare to let her emotions be so unrestrained.</p><p>“Uh…” Elder Yu was at a loss for words.</p><p>He then realized that Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t human.</p><p>While his peers hadn’t even overcome the psychological barrier, this guy had already killed a demi-saint.</p><p>“They’re not good people anyway. You should stay away from the Sacred Mountain and them. After that, I will take you somewhere else to play. We’ll stay away from the continent.” Elder Yu had an idea.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen wiped her tears and remained silent.</p><p>“Alright?” Elder Yu forced a smile.</p><p>“Not good.”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>“Stay away?” Yu Zhiwen’s mind went blank.</p><p>She suddenly realized that even though Hallmaster Dao had gone, Grandpa Yu and her Supreme Master were still around.</p><p>As long as they were still watching, she couldn’t grow, let alone catch up with Xu Xiaoshou’s progress.</p><p>Only by truly disappearing and distancing herself…</p><p>“Alright.” With this thought, Yu Zhiwen finally agreed.</p><p>“Alright?” Elder Yu was overjoyed.</p><p>He didn’t know what his great-granddaughter was thinking and only laughed.</p><p>“It’s good that you’ve let it go. Xu Xiaoshou and Hallmaster Xuanji still have many unresolved matters. You mustn’t get involved. I’m so happy that you’ve let it go…”</p><p>“What is it?” Yu Zhiwen’s Pearl Gem Star Eyes trembled, and her hand stopped in front of her eyes as she turned to look at him.</p><p>“Uh, uh, uh…”</p><p>Elder Yu’s body shook, his eyes darting back and forth three times. He looked up at the sky and hurriedly pointed.</p><p>“Eh? Little Yu, look! Xu Xiaoshou has pulled someone out!”</p><p>…</p><p>High in the sky.</p><p>Facing the dying Dao Xuanji, Xu Xiaoshou had no intention of letting her go.</p><p>Before he killed this person last time, he had studied the body structure of the Dao siblings.</p><p>This time, he wanted to ask a question in front of the person who had once been involved.</p><p>“Dragon Apricot!”</p><p>Without lifting his head, he gave the command.</p><p>The space around the ghostly energy throne fluctuated, and a delicate figure appeared in Xu Xiaoshou’s arms.</p><p>It was a woman in a black dress. Her silver-white hair fell over her shoulders, her eyes tightly closed, and her lips colorless. She was unconscious.</p><p>“Dao Xuanji, you should know…”</p><p>“I have a junior sister.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou carried the person in his arms and stood up from the ghostly energy throne expressionlessly. He stepped forward through the air with firm strides.</p><p>As he advanced, the Life Dao Disc opened beneath his feet, creating the Life Power Upanishad Formation.</p><p>The air trembled, and everyone felt as if they were bathed in spring rain, sensing the surrounding vitality surging.</p><p>However, this boundless vitality was being wildly absorbed by the beautiful figure in Xu Xiaoshou’s arms, who was doing so unconsciously.</p><p>The entire world fell silent.</p><p>Everyone suddenly sensed something was amiss and merely watched. They were too apprehensive to make a move.</p><p>In the quiet Jade Capital City, only Xu Xiaoshou’s voice slowly echoed, “Her name is Mu Zixi.”</p><p>“Of course, you might have heard of her long ago. She also has another name… Lei Xi’er.”</p><p>“Lei?”</p><p>In front of Dao Xuanji, the Lei family, whom he hadn’t seen for a long time, appeared.</p><p>At this moment, the people in Jade Capital City were stunned and unable to react immediately. However, the Saints in the city felt a chill, realizing that something was very wrong.</p><p>Fang Wenxin’s pupils shook. Even those who hadn’t emerged from seclusion for a long time knew about this.</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi’s eyes widened. Even as a researcher, he had heard of this.</p><p>Mei Siren and Ye Xiaotian took deep breaths and exchanged worried glances, knowing that there was no way Jade Capital City would remain peaceful today.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian felt it even more profoundly!</p><p>In Ye Xiaotian’s memory, Xu Xiaoshou and Mu Zixi, the pair of Senior Brother and Junior Sister, had been busy in the Spiritual Library Division of the Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>They were always running around, causing explosions and creating chaos.</p><p>He never expected…</p><p>The scene shifted. The two troublemakers from the Spirit Palace had somehow made their way to the head of Jade Capital City!</p><p>And even confronted Dao Xuanji!</p><p>Back then, they were young and endured many humiliations.</p><p>Now, they had returned to avenge those past grievances.</p><p>“I have a very important and serious question. Please answer it before you die.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, holding Lei Xi’er, who was slowly regaining her vitality, approached Dao Xuanji with a cold expression.</p><p>“Ultimate Life Demon Physique?!”</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s eyes shone brightly under the surging devilish energy, as she seemed to regain clarity and recognized the deeply etched memory, the Ultimate Life Demon Physique!</p><p>—</p><p>“Ah, this…”</p><p>Below, Elder Yu pointed at the sky and suddenly felt it would be better to avoid discussing the topic.</p><p>Ultimate Life Demon Physique?</p><p>This was overwhelming!</p><p>“Little Yu, how about I take you to play in the Southern Underworld?” Elder Yu hurriedly grabbed his great-granddaughter’s hand, trying to move away from the center of the storm.</p><p>He couldn’t budge her.</p><p>He couldn’t pull her away.</p><p>“Let’s go. We can’t stay here!” Elder Yu urged urgently.</p><p>“I won’t leave.” Yu Zhiwen’s tone was calm but resolute.</p><p>It was as if her feet were rooted to the ground, yet her delicate body trembled.</p><p>Her Pearl Gem Star Eyes quivered as she looked over, her mind flashing back to the brief yet piercing question from the Five Decays of Heaven and Man on Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>“Sinner…”</p><p>“Who is the sinner?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
