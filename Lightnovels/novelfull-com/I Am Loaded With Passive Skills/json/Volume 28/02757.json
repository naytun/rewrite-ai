This battlefield belongs to the Lei family, the Yu Family, and Hallmaster Xuanji!”</p><p>“This voice…Mm, I haven’t heard of it.”</p><p>All Spiritual Cultivators in the city looked around but couldn’t find the person who had spoken.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian seemed to have sensed something and took out a Divine Array Wheel, which was shimmering with a faint Holy Light.</p><p>This array wheel came from Xuan Wuji after he and the so-called Patriarch Wuji were chased by Wangze Holy Emperor and hid in the Holy palace.</p><p>At that time, he thought that this array wheel might be useful later…</p><p>He supposed now is the time to send it out on the battlefield?</p><p>Ye Xiaotian did not hesitate to infuse his Holy Energy into the Divine Array Wheel and tossed it far away.</p><p>The divine path pattern in the void was outlined, and soon, it transformed into a blurry Door of Space.</p><p>Behind the door, two blurry figures stepped out one after another.</p><p>The person in the lead was a black-robed young man. He held a walking stick in his right hand. As he walked forward, he took off his bamboo hat, revealing a grizzled face.</p><p>He looked very scary, and there was a black cloth tied around his eyes. He was dressed like a blind man.</p><p>Following closely behind was a white-haired old man holding a Divine Disc in his hand.</p><p>This old man’s presence was extremely low as if he was deliberately concealing his aura, not wanting to attract too much attention.</p><p>Not many Spiritual Cultivators in Jade Capital City paid any attention to the old man behind them. Their eyes were all fixed on the blind young man’s face.</p><p>Soon, someone exclaimed,</p><p>“Lei Shuangxing?”</p><p>“He’s Saint Servant Lei Shuangxing, and he’s holding the famed sword, Divine-beating Crutch!”</p><p>The identity of the newcomer was obvious.</p><p>If the name “Saint Servant Lord Shou” had risen to fame recently, then “Saint Servant Lei Shuangxing” had been famous for far too long.</p><p>In the years before Lord Shou was born, he was known as the number one youth in the underworld.</p><p>In recent years, although the limelight had been stolen by a certain someone and he rarely carried out heavy missions, back then, he was rumored to be the successor of the Saint Servant.</p><p>Later, Bazhun’an’s identity was revealed, and for a time, Lei Shuangxing was rumored to be Bazhun’an’s personal disciple.</p><p>This personal disciple of the Eighth Sword Deity was much more valuable than that in-name disciple, Xiao Kongtong. He was also much luckier.</p><p>At that time, countless people were too envious to even react, but now looking back on it…</p><p>Lei Xi’er, Lei Shuangxing, Yu Zhiwen’s Lei Family’s Eyes, and Dao Xuanji, who caused the Lei family’s extermination…this was a circle!</p><p>This circle should have been closed more than ten years ago, but because of a person called Bazhun’an, it had not ended yet.</p><p>In the Jade Capital City, there were already people frowning and whispering,</p><p>“I heard that when Bazhun’an was young, he traveled the world with his sword, making quite a few enemies but also many friends. It seems he had some kind of relationship with the family head of the Lei family from that generation.”</p><p>“So, when the Lei family was destroyed, Lei Shuangxing was actually saved by Bazhun’an, who was the Saint Servant Chief. Perhaps, that was why he joined the Saint Servant?”</p><p>“If you ask me, who should I ask?”</p><p>“Sigh, aren’t we using our brains together…Speaking of which, why did the Lei family get destroyed? How could I forget such detail?”</p><p>“The reason seems to be colluding with the ghost beasts?”</p><p>“Yes, no wonder I forgot about it…So his sister Lei Xi-er, who is also Xu Xiaoshou’s junior sister Mu Zixi, joined the Tiansang Spirit Palace and was raised by the Saint Servant, Sleeveless?”</p><p>“I know a bit about that. It seems Mu Zixi hasn’t been in the Tiansang Spirit Palace of the Eastern Region for very long…”</p><p>“That’s not important! The important thing is the fact that they were raised separately, brother! They didn’t put all their eggs in the same basket just for today’s return? Damn, I’m getting a little fired up…”</p><p>“So Hallmaster Xuanji is the sinner? After all, Lord Shou had just verified that nothing would happen to the contracted ghost beast!”</p><p>“How can you frame Hallmaster Xuanji? Are you a Saint Servant?”</p><p>“Don’t spout nonsense. I’m not. But if Hallmaster Xuanji isn’t a sinner, how could her disciple, Yu Zhiwen, question her Supreme Master at such a delicate moment? What can’t be discussed later?”</p><p>“Sigh, my Yu Zhiwen…”</p><p>After a round of discussion in Jade Capital City, the topic shifted back to the young man in the Central Region, whom the public only dared to observe from a distance.</p><p>At this moment, everyone felt that this discussion was a little roundabout.</p><p>Some people found Yu Zhiwen pitiful.</p><p>There were also some who felt that she was pretending to be pitiful and was not worthy of sympathy.</p><p>The truth was that she had used the Lei Family’s Pearl Gem Star Eyes as an outsider.</p><p>As for the issue of “bloodline”…</p><p>Things that were unclear had to be explained by the people involved.</p><p>…</p><p>Yu Zhiwen, who was in the limelight, was not paying attention to the outsiders at all.</p><p>She turned her eyes when she heard the voice and saw the tall, thin, white-faced young man with blurry facial features walking out of the door of light.</p><p>As he approached her, through the black cloth that covered his eyes, through the obstruction of light and darkness…</p><p>Their gazes from different time and space crossed each other, triggering the broken memories in Yu Zhiwen’s mind that had been sealed for a long time.</p><p>In the scene, it was a sunny afternoon. Beside a laurel tree with fragrant flowers and chirping birds, on the shore of a spiritual pool…</p><p>A little girl, who was still waiting for a fish to bite and feeling quite bored, glanced back and saw a young boy holding another little girl who looked like a porcelain doll.</p><p>“I guess your surname is Lei and you followed the elders of the clan up the mountain? Wow, is this your sister? She’s so cute…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
