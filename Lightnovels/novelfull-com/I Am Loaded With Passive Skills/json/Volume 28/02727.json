He was about to issue the order for the three Saints to block Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He suddenly froze.</p><p>He looked into the distance and saw that the Ghost Beast Contract formed by the Divine Path Principles had turned into two rays of light.</p><p>The soul of Greedy the Cat Spirit had fallen under the Thousand Ghost Soul Capture technique.</p><p>It landed on the Purple Mansion between the eyebrows of Xu Xiaoshou’s main body.</p><p>“Ghost beast contract?!”</p><p>Xi ‘s eyes widened and he let out a cry of surprise. His entire body went completely cold from his palms to his feet.</p><p>Who was this Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Apart from the other unorthodox methods, he still had the unparalleled Body Technique, the unparalleled swordsmanship and the almost unparalleled Spiritual Cultivation. He also had the Great Path Diagram that Senior Zhong Yuanzi had just researched.</p><p>With such talents, he still wanted to add another Body of Devour?</p><p>Let’s not talk about the failure of the contract.</p><p>If he succeeded, he would become a giant that could rival a Holy Emperor and easily defeat Fang Wenxin, Yu Kunpeng, and Zhong Yuanzi…</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>When he thought of this, Xi went numb with shock.</p><p>A Sword-devouring Kunpeng that was proficient in all attributes?</p><p>The kind that when a Holy Emperor came, he could crush, eat, and digest with a single slap?</p><p>“Pay attention to your safety!”</p><p>Xi didn’t have time to issue Elder Yu the order to stop them. After his exhortation, he amended some of his instructions, then turned around and ran towards the Saint Hall.</p><p>If he didn’t send this information back in time, the next time Hallmaster Xuanji came out, she would probably be eaten to the bone!</p><p>“Lord Shou…”</p><p>Li Fugui had almost left Jade Capital City when he suddenly saw the change in the high-altitude fighter jet. Lord Shou suddenly on a whim wanted to contract Greedy the Cat Spirit?</p><p>It shouldn’t be!</p><p>How did the battle situation turn out this way?</p><p>Even if Lord Shou had great respect for Fang Wenxin and did not want to take advantage of the situation.</p><p>There was no need for him to use such a method that would push him to the cusp of the storm to take Greedy the Cat Spirit back, right?</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Perhaps it wasn’t such a superficial reason?</p><p>When he recalled what Lord Shou had stated in front of the world, Li Fugui seemed to have understood.</p><p>What he understood about Lord Shou was actually still based on the information he got about Xu Xiaoshou before and on Abyss Island. It was slightly different from the current Lord Shou.</p><p>And the truth was…</p><p>Ever since Abyss Island, Xu Xiaoshou had really become Lord Shou and even his mentality had changed completely!</p><p>This could be seen from the fact that outside the Four Symbols Secret Realm, he could have chosen to ‘escape’ in order to have a better face-off with the Holy Emperor Bei Huai. Instead he chose to face the difficulties head-on!</p><p>Similarly, in Jade Capital City…</p><p>Previously, Li Fugui had suspected that Lord Shou’s attack on Jade Capital City and the Sacred Mountain might have been influenced by the Blood World Pearl. It was an irrational decision.</p><p>Now he understood that this was not the case!</p><p>To take a ‘detour’ seemed to be the best choice at the moment, but just like his previous escape, it was too passive.</p><p>As long as the timeline was extended, anyone could see Lord Shou’s long-term vision:</p><p>For example, during the Four Symbols Secret Realm, the Holy Emperor Bei Huai might have pursued him relentlessly and eventually caught up with Lord Shou again for another battle.</p><p>For example, if they didn’t fight now, they would still have to fight after all the Saints of the Holy Mountain returned. It didn’t matter if Lord Shou was still in Jade Capital City.</p><p>Instead of that, it was better to turn the passive into an active and launch a direct attack!</p><p>“He, has really changed…”</p><p>This was a huge change in his mentality.</p><p>After Lord Shou became independent, he had matured a lot.</p><p>In the past, from the Spirit Palace to Abyss Island, he had just passively followed whatever arrangements Bazhun’an made; he was a mere pawn and accepted his orders.</p><p>Now, he had combined everything and turned all his passive skills into instant active skills. He was now the master chess player!</p><p>When he considered this level in the change of his mentality and perceived how Lord Shou entered into a contract with Greedy the Cat Spirit, Li Fugui understood it in an instant.</p><p>No matter how difficult the situation was, could it ever be as difficult as Abyss Island?</p><p>No matter how strong the enemy was, could he ever be as strong Hallmaster Dao?</p><p>No matter how great the danger was, could it be greater than the pressure brought by the Holy Emperor Bei Huai?</p><p>Lord Shou had endured everything. What was there to fear now?</p><p>“Beep.”</p><p>After Li Fugui left the city and the shattered Xuanji great array, he took out his communication bead.</p><p>As the Tower Master of the First Pavilion in the Sky was out at the frontlines, he, the future second-in-command, had to do the logistics work well.</p><p>Soon, the communication bead contacted the internal department of the Flower Pavilion.</p><p>“It’s me. I’m Li Fugui.”</p><p>“Lord Shou has contracted the ghost beast Greedy the Cat Spirit in the Central Region of Jade Capital City. It’s a foregone conclusion. Please contact the Xu Yue Grey Palace in the name of the First Pavilion in the Sky.”</p><p>“… oh right, Palace Master Bai Zhou doesn’t like Bazhun’an, so don’t use the name of the Saint Servant. It’s fine to use the First Pavilion in the Sky. I’ve already established some connections with them, but currently I can’t get away and can’t go over for the time being. You just have to send someone else .”</p><p>“… we are not allies! Times are different now and you can take a tougher stand in the negotiations. The First Pavilion in the Sky will be the leader, and Xu Yue Grey Palace will be the support. This is the bottom line. You can negotiate the rest on your own. You should know what Lord Shou is like.”</p><p>“… Heh, Lord Shou will definitely succeed! After the Seven Sword Deity are done with the ranking, we will go to the Southern Region. I will tell Lord Shou to bring Lord Greedy the Cat Spirit to visit the Xu Yue Grey Palace. You should also ask them to plan a welcome ceremony in advance.”</p><p>“…. That’s right, the war faction will look for Feng Xiaose, the conservative faction will look for Caramel and Xin Gugu, and follow this line to look for the Palace Master Bai Zhou… Eh, Elder Wu Xia can do it as well. He has met Lord Shou before.”</p><p>“Trust me, Palace Master Bai Zhou will definitely agree! If he is still hesitant, just inform him that Hallmaster Xuanji had declared war on the Southern Region, especially his Xu Yue Grey Palace. This news will spread throughout the five domains of the continent in no time. Yes, it’s confirmed that Hallmaster Dao has stepped down. The one in charge now is his younger sister, the handiwork of Lord Shou!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
