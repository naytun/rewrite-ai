(×)</p><p>Not even one in ten thousand! (✓)</p><p>But after all, Heavenly Unravel still needs to be quantified.</p><p>Thus, “long time” and “deep cultivation level,” even if not decisive factors, have been used by the world as standards to measure whether one can achieve Heavenly Unravel, or even a perfect Heavenly Unravel.</p><p>How long has the Fourth Sword been with Lord Shou?</p><p>The vast majority are still unable to properly transition from recognizing its identity as a sword wielded by Bazhun’an in the past to now being with Xu Xiaoshou, which says a lot.</p><p>Considering the time since the Fourth Sword was unsealed and re-emerged in the world at White Cave, if we really calculate it, it’s only been around half a year.</p><p>And in such a short time, it could achieve Heavenly Unravel?!</p><p>Even if we take into account that the Fourth Sword might have had covert contact with Lord Shou before, and Lord Shou has learned the Witness Sword Technique, which greatly helps with Heavenly Unravel…</p><p>One year?</p><p>In one year, to conquer the temperamental viciousness of one of the Five Great Divine Instruments of Chaos and achieve Heavenly Unravel?</p><p>Even Beibei was momentarily stupefied, feeling like his decade of effort was wasted, unable to compare with a true genius who just by stretching lazily might have famed swords offering themselves as a pillow.</p><p>Holding the Dao Imparting Mirror, Feng Zhongzui, who was accustomed to big scenes, was even more shocked, dropping his jaw in awe, while his family head, Feng Tingchen, found it unbelievable.</p><p>But the term “Fierce Sword Heavenly Unravel” had already come out.</p><p>The overwhelming and tyrannical aura that spread with great ferocity slapped the faces of the spectators harshly, inflicting deep, heartfelt pain.</p><p>—It wasn’t an illusion; it really was Heavenly Unravel!</p><p>At this moment, everyone suddenly remembered that Heavenly Unravel couldn’t be quantified after all…</p><p>Just as not even half of the Seven Sword Deities from the previous generation could perfectly achieve Heavenly Unravel at the time they were sealed on the list, yet the Eighth Sword Deity who came after surpassed this number by himself.</p><p>Lord Shou was also accomplishing some cross-generational feats!</p><p>He even surpassed the mark left by the Eighth Sword Deity, conquering the so-called strongest sword-bearer, becoming an even mightier person holding the Fourth Sword!</p><p>Every Venation Sight Arena in front of the Dao Imparting Mirror was boiling over, with everyone realizing that this battle was destined to become legendary!</p><p>Not to speak of Feng Zhongzui, who was close by the battlezone; he was even more hysterical, screaming his lungs out:</p><p>“Is the first battle of the Seven Sword Deities actually a Heavenly Unravel battle?”</p><p>“The Supreme Emperor Sword versus the vicious sword, in the end, who will last, my brothers? I’ll have a sneak peek first!”</p><p>…</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Inside the battlezone, End’s Fury, while executing those confined in the Emperor’s Palace, suddenly lost its target.</p><p>And when the word “Sacrifice” from the Fourth Sword’s Heavenly Unravel was set, the sky, previously filled with glittering golden scales, was suddenly tainted insane by the endless black demonic aura.</p><p>“Whoo——”</p><p>Billowing black mists surged around, pushing up in circles where the towering Heavenly Emperor Sword was descending, and then slowly solidifying into four colossal fierce beasts in the east, south, west, and north directions.</p><p>The beasts were fierce in appearance, baring teeth and claws, with ferocity laid bare. Each had blood-red eyes, exhibiting boundless madness.</p><p>The Supreme Emperor Sword had never witnessed it, but Feng Zhongzui had long heard of the reputation of the vicious sword. He immediately danced with joy, his excitement reaching a breaking point:</p><p>“One of the Four Sword Heavenly Unravel forms, the Four Fierce Beasts Sword once released by the Eighth Sword immortal!”</p><p>“It’s said that during the War of the Ten High Nobles, the Eighth Sword Deity used this move, with the power of the Qiong Qi, to bite off the arm of the previous Hallmaster Dao… Oops! Okay, the old family head will stop here.”</p><p>“Anyway, I don’t know if it’s true or not, but I’ve said everything I can, you all need to judge the truth for yourselves!”</p><p>In front of the Dao Imparting Mirror at Half-Moon Bay, Dao Qiongcang narrowed his eyes and grinned while delivering a combination of punches into the air in front of Bazhun’an.</p><p>He then turned to Elder Wuyue and said, “Why don’t you also go and practice the Witness Sword Technique?”</p><p>Elder Wuyue kept his gaze fixed: “No need anymore.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang then looked back at Bazhun’an, bumped his shoulder, and said ingratiatingly, “I already have Innate Sword Intent. Give me Witness Sword Technique for thirty Spirit Crystals, how about it?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Or else, when I achieve Heavenly Mechanism Godhood-Sealing, I’ll bring you along, okay?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Huh? Such a rubbish Eighth Sword Immortal, a miser!”</p><p>While grumbling, a loud bang erupted, and the vicious beast Qiong Qi, displayed in the Dao Imparting Mirror as a full panoramic transmission without frames, appeared to almost step on everyone’s heads.</p><p>This frightened the crowd into retreating in an uproar, soon realizing that an attack from far away in Jade Capital City couldn’t reach the Southern Region, let alone themselves.</p><p>It was too realistic!</p><p>The Dao Imparting Mirror was so realistic it made people feel as if they were on the spot!</p><p>But when the Qiong Qi stepped down, its sky-covering form burst into black radiance, its mouth fiercely biting down on the Heavenly Emperor Sword.</p><p>“Clang——”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
