Bang! Bang!”</p><p>Three more earth-shattering explosions followed as Taotie, Taowu, and chaos beasts tore and bit in succession.</p><p>Several great beasts from all directions—some shaking the sword hilt, some biting the sword guard, some clamping onto the sword body…</p><p>With a fierce jerk of their heads, the ferocious beasts pulled viciously.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>As eyes bulged in shock, the Heavenly Emperor Sword seemingly torn asunder by the mighty tugs, suddenly misaligned harshly.</p><p>“Rebels, die!”</p><p>Empress Beibei appeared abruptly, her seemingly insubstantial form striking the Sovereign Emperor Sword with a palm, her aura surged immensely.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The displaced Heavenly Emperor Sword realigned, merging into one.</p><p>The Four Great Fierce Beasts were sent flying by the recoil of the greatsword, their forms hurtling backward as though to be blasted from the Jade Capital City to the spectating arena within the Five Domain.</p><p>“Beasts as slaves, ferocity as sin.”</p><p>“Rampant and devoid of form, such sins must be punished!”</p><p>As the chilling voice fell, just like a statement of law, Empress Beibei’s stature suddenly soared, reaching the heights of the heavens.</p><p>She grasped the Heavenly Emperor Sword with both hands, then swept and flung it wide, cleaving across all directions.</p><p>Under the Dao Imparting Mirror’s broadcast, the sword seemed massive enough to have swept across spectating sites like the Burial Sword Tomb, the Heavenly Immortal City, and Half-Moon Bay.</p><p>While everyone flinched and ducked in horror and haste, the sword looped back overhead to its original position above Jade Capital City.</p><p>“Boom boom boom boom!”</p><p>The Four Great Fierce Beasts were subdued once and for all, exploding into endless demonic auras.</p><p>“Woah…”</p><p>At this moment, spectators across the five regions felt their scalps tingle.</p><p>Belonging to ancient swordsmen was a relentless and cutting display of violent aesthetics, providing a lesson for countless Spiritual Cultivators.</p><p>Could battle be fought this way?</p><p>Could swordsmen be so powerful?</p><p>To think that just focusing on attack power, even at the Sovereign stage one could be acknowledged as a Sword Deity, could unleash an attack rivaling that of a demi-saint…</p><p>No! Surpassing the attack power of an ordinary demi-saint?</p><p>“Ancient swordsmen really are all madmen; I’ll never provoke them again in the future. Beibei, while looking so cute and chubby…”</p><p>“Has Lord Shou fallen? With the Fourth Sword Heavenly Unravel Imagery, just like that, taken down? So, he never truly achieved the Perfect Heavenly Unravel, unable to match the fit between the Sovereign Emperor Sword and Sword Deity Bei, right?”</p><p>“Of course, he cannot compare in terms of fit. After all, they share over a decade of emotional bondage. But if you look at Sword Deity Bei’s empress-like demeanor below, after that strike, she reverted back to her original form, and even her aura…”</p><p>“Right! Falling short; she’s becoming insubstantial!”</p><p>“Ancient swordsmen are all like that, lacking in physical endurance, inherently frail to death. The Heavenly Unravel further depletes the sword-bearer’s vitality and spirit. If the fight drags on, it won’t bode well for Sword Deity Bei!”</p><p>“Unfavorable? Lord Shou has been slain, and you say unfavorable… huh?”</p><p>The voice of doubt had no chance to grow as the view transmitted by the Dao Imparting Mirror revealed, upon the Four Fierce Beasts’ destruction, the Sovereign Emperor Sword also began to be tainted with a streak of demonic aura.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>That thing was like a virus corroding the Divine Secrets Array, spreading fast along Beibei’s Sword Intent and rapidly turning the Heavenly Emperor Sword pitch-black.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang of Half-Moon Bay froze for a moment, then abruptly stood, finding the scene eerily familiar: “Is Xu Xiaoshou using the same method to decipher the Sovereign Emperor Sword’s Heavenly Unravel Imagery that he used to hack my great array of the Jade Capital City?”</p><p>“Is that possible?” Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang grasped Bazhun’an’s shoulder with a look of disbelief on his face.</p><p>Bazhun’an curled his lips slightly, not stingy with praises, “Unbound imagination, unconventional.”</p><p>“He’s cheating!” exclaimed Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang, pointing at the blackened sword in the mirror, “Xu Xiaoshou should be disqualified. He cannot continue the fight, Beibei has won!”</p><p>“No,” Gou Wuyue shook his head, “he didn’t use the Way of the Heavens’ energy movement or rather, in his understanding, does Ancient Sword Technique encompass… um, a ‘Weaving Heavenly Secret’ method to ‘Weave Sword Intent’?”</p><p>Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang suddenly turned towards the ex-Holy Divine Palace person who seemed inclined to disagree, then noticed Gou Wuyue, surrounded by a faint hint of path energy, deep in thought.</p><p>Upon looking at Bazhun’an, he realized Bazhun’an had also achieved an understanding, his eyes flickering with contemplative light.</p><p>Could it be?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s swordplay could inspire these two experienced swordsmen?</p><p>Had he created this technique himself? If this continued, how could Beibei possibly overcome him?</p><p>Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang covered his head, exaggerating disbelief to lighten the mood and break the concentration of the two engrossed in enlightenment.</p><p>He repeated the word “Weaving” that Gou Wuyue had just uttered, eventually squatting down and staring vacantly at the Dao Imparting Mirror as well.</p><p>“No way?” Wei Feng was close to madness.</p><p>He turned his head only to find the three beside him had all entered an epiphanic state, “What are you guys doing?!”</p><p>There was no response.</p><p>Shock mixed with speechlessness, Wei Feng looked towards the Storyteller, who shrugged with a look of normalcy:</p><p>“Don’t forget, we may be geniuses, but they are the Ten High Nobles.”</p><p>“A casual step on a blade of grass by the roadside can be enough for them to comprehend the cycle of life and reincarnation.”</p><p>Wei Feng stiffened at the sound.</p><p>The Storyteller pointed towards the Dao Imparting Mirror with a secret smile and whispered, “My Big Brother Shou is the same~”</p><p>…</p><p>Big Brother Shou was in a state of Divine Traveling Void~</p><p>Heavenly Unravel was too powerful.</p><p>Under Xu Xiaoji’s will, Xu Xiaoshou was practically sailing across a vast ocean of Sword Intent, continuously absorbing the battle experience being fed back by the vicious sword, Fourth Sword.</p><p>With a rich foundation of knowledge, in his current state of inspired serenity, he could exhibit a Hand of Godhood’s precision, further evolving into peak forms of swordsmanship.</p><p>Take, for instance, this moment…</p><p>It was merely the beast Taowu biting the sword that made Xu Xiaoshou think of Qingyuan Mountain’s Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang’s control over Mei Siren, a beast gnawing on the Taicheng Sword.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
