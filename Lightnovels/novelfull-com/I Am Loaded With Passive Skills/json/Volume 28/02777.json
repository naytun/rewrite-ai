He was neither humble nor overbearing, making everyone feel as if they were bathing in a spring breeze.</p><p>He did not have the sharp aura of a swordsman. He appeared more like an ordinary elder.</p><p>Dressed in a simple and plain green-white sword robe, his long white hair at the temples added to his tall, upright posture and gave him a free-spirited, unrestrained temperament.</p><p>“There’s no need for such courtesy, Elder Feng.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian glanced calmly and first noticed the saber at Feng Tingchen’s waist.</p><p>One of the 21 Famed Swords, the Crane Sword “Tingchen.”</p><p>The sword was over three feet long, with a handguard engraved with the image of a red-crowned white crane spreading its wings. Its entire blade was dark yellow, exuding an otherworldly quality.</p><p>Much like Feng Tingchen himself, the sword was not widely known, hidden away from the world, yet it didn’t lack a fighting spirit.</p><p>He raised his head slightly.</p><p>The elder’s eyebrows were faint, and his forehead had wrinkles.</p><p>His face showed the marks of old age, yet his eyes were more spirited than those of a young man, bright and penetrating.</p><p>“Ancient swordsmen are all the same. They seem polite on the surface, but their ambitions reach higher than the heavens…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian cursed inwardly, rising slightly to maintain his level with Feng Tingchen without surpassing him.</p><p>In terms of cultivation level, he was a demi-saint, while Feng Tingchen was only a Sword Deity.</p><p>However, the latter’s combat strength was unknown. Considering his mastery of returning to true essence, he was likely not much weaker than an ordinary demi-saint.</p><p>In terms of experience, Feng Tingchen was extremely old, only a generation lower than Mei Siren and You Tu, yet he was a generation above other Sword Deity of his era, such as Gou Wuyue and Rao Yaoyao… Who else? In any case, they were all a generation younger!</p><p>Ye Xiaotian had heard of Feng Tingchen’s reputation when he was young. Now, facing him as a sanctified saint, he naturally wouldn’t dare act recklessly. That wasn’t his style.</p><p>“Time is tight. Master Siren should have already informed you of everything.” Ye Xiaotian got straight to the point. “Where is the Feng family’s combat supervisor? Follow me to the Central Region now!”</p><p>“It’s me.” Feng Tingchen smiled, pointing to himself.</p><p>“You?” Ye Xiaotian was surprised. He thought, “Wasn’t this man supposed to have withdrawn from worldly affairs? How could Xu Xiaoshou’s battle with Beibei still involve him?”</p><p>“There’s also Elder Yang.” Feng Tingchen added, pointing behind him.</p><p>Another ancient swordsman leapt out from the Feng family’s Wind-Listening Pavilion.</p><p>This man was thin, with a prominent forehead, a sword on his back, and an aura that could uproot mountains.</p><p>In stark contrast to Feng Tingchen, his temperament was not reserved. It was fully unleashed, like a sword drawn from its sheath.</p><p>“Elder Yang, Yang Xizhi.” Feng Tingchen introduced.</p><p>“Greetings, Demi-Saint Ye.” Yang Xizhi had a goatee, and his eyes were sharp as if they could pierce through a person. His genial tone carried a hint of sharpness, clearly showing he was not someone content with being subordinate.</p><p>Yang Xizhi was from the same generation as Gu Yu, You Tu, and Mei Siren, a generation older than Feng Tingchen.</p><p>However, he was only ranked among the Seven Sword Deity this year. In the “Two Elders, Yi Xiao and Li Fuyu”, the Two Elders referred to Elder Gu and Elder Yang.</p><p>“The second Sword Deity?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian looked over with a faint smile.</p><p>With someone like Feng Tingchen, he would speak politely.</p><p>But with an ancient swordsman who openly displayed his prowess, Ye Xiaotian enjoyed provoking them.</p><p>It was like provoking Xiao Qixiu in his youth. A single remark could provoke many reactions from these hot-tempered swordsmen.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Yang Xizhi nodded heavily, without displeasure or retort. He calmly acknowledged his ranking, seemingly unaware of any slight mockery in Ye Xiaotian’s words.</p><p>Seeing Yang Xizhi’s composure, Ye Xiaotian didn’t feel embarrassed.</p><p>Ancient swordsmen were often inwardly reserved. No one knew what they were thinking at this moment.</p><p>Feng Tingchen chuckled lightly and interrupted, “Demi-Saint Ye is indeed humorous.”</p><p>“However, the new ranking of the Seven Sword Deity has just been established. These rankings are only temporary. The true results will be revealed when the rankings are finalized. Elder Yang’s strength is not limited to this.”</p><p>Hearing this, Ye Xiaotian turned his head. Recalling how this man had dared to stand taller than him earlier, he remarked, “I have a question I’m curious about…”</p><p>“This Seven Sword Deity ranking was determined by your Feng family in the Southern Region. Since Elder Yang is on good terms with Elder Feng and is also a guest in Feng Family City, I’ve heard that the two of you are close and have even slept in the same room.”</p><p>“Then why, in ‘Two Elders Yi Xiao’, was Elder Gu ranked before Elder Yang?”</p><p>Yang Xizhi remained unmoved and even looked at Feng Tingchen as if he wanted to hear his answer before others.</p><p>Feng Tingchen continued to talk and laugh, not giving the demi-saint Ye the cold shoulder. Smiling, he replied, “If Demi-Saint Ye wishes to ask that…”</p><p>“Should I give a serious answer, ranking them according to the ‘Sword Pagoda’s’ assessment, or should I make a joke and say it’s to avoid suspicion?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian raised an eyebrow, detecting a subtle sharpness hidden within his words.</p><p>For Feng Tingchen to manage the Feng family in the chaotic Land of Sins in the Southern Region, he was certainly not an ordinary person.</p><p>His words directly addressed the doubts of those unfamiliar with the Seven Sword Deity while subtly mocking Ye Xiaotian’s over-the-top jest.</p><p>Yet when he spoke, it was gentle and not difficult to accept. At the same time, he deftly passed the ball back, allowing the questioner to answer and choose, based on their response.</p><p>No hostility.</p><p>However, if you were here to cause trouble, the Feng family was no pushover. They could take your jest and had the power to counter your provocations!</p><p>“Haha…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian laughed heartily.</p><p>He was certainly not here to cause trouble. He was just here to pick someone up.</p><p>His question stemmed purely from curiosity, with perhaps a bit of personal annoyance, limited to the level of height and not directed at the Feng family.</p><p>Seeing Feng Tingchen’s hardened stance, he stepped down and moved on from the topic.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
