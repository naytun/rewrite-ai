The Ten High Nobles’ Dao Qiongcang, the unfathomable Dao Qiongcang, and the former Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace are here with you, eating and drinking together. How does that feel?”</p><p>The burly man being embraced felt elevated. His pores seemed to open up, and with a face of pure delight, he exclaimed, “Awesome! D*mn awesome, I’m honored to call you Dao Qiongcang my brother.”</p><p>The Elder Dao the Flamboyant chuckled at this and set down the wine pot, asking, “So, which feels better, being hugged by Bazhun’an or by me, Dao Qiongcang?”</p><p>“D*mn! You know how to tease me!” The burly man was excited. “It’s all great! Having you all together is the best! Hahaha…”</p><p>The atmosphere in the inn was pushed to the extreme.</p><p>Meeting such a big shot was the best entertainment for the Southern Region’s death apostles.</p><p>Inside the Riches Inn, the mood was lively.</p><p>Outside, the place was packed. Everyone nearby knew Dao Qiongcang was here and wanted to come over and see for themselves.</p><p>“Hey, don’t push me. Who are you…”</p><p>“D*mn! You’re a show-off too!”</p><p>Amidst the commotion outside, a one-armed swordsman in a white robe pushed his way through. He had a long sword at his waist, pale gold with pink accents, and a melodic sound.</p><p>He kept his head lowered, his face slightly shadowed and quickly moved to a corner. He almost became translucent before sitting down.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked over with pride.</p><p>Once everyone’s attention was focused on him, he dramatically flung his sleeves and asked loudly, “Gou Wuyue, do I have the demeanor of a Sword Deity?”</p><p>The inn fell into an instant silence, followed by a burst of excitement.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>“D*mn! Gou Wuyue? I was just wondering who this one-armed guy was playing. He’s the Moonless Sword Deity!”</p><p>“D*mn it, are you going to make me laugh so hard that I give you all 723 Spirit Crystals, Dao Qiongcang? And you, Gou Wuyue! Haha, this name feels so good. I’m having this too!”</p><p>“Amazing, amazing. But I must say, they got their information right. I also heard that the Moonless Sword Deity has escaped the Dead Sea…”</p><p>“Pfft, help me up. I can’t get up.”</p><p>“Who are you? You’re pushing in too. Are you a character too?”</p><p>A short old man in black squeezed through the crowd outside the inn. Not only was he striking in appearance, but his aura was also quite formidable.</p><p>However, after some time, the people blocking the door still couldn’t figure out who this third figure was supposed to be.</p><p>“The little old man isn’t tall, but his broadsword is quite long and looks impressive. What grade of spiritual weapon is that?”</p><p>“Ah! My hand!”</p><p>The man had just reached out when the old man in black’s broadsword whirled and severed his hand. Blood spurted out.</p><p>This turn of events caused everyone’s mood to chill.</p><p>“Who is this?”</p><p>The man clutched his severed hand, his voice trembling, “Who the hell are you supposed to be?”</p><p>“I’m the God of Killing… Bah!”</p><p>The old man in black shot him a cold glare and retorted, “I’m Wei Feng. If you keep making a scene, I’ll kill you. Get lost!”</p><p>“Wei Feng? Who’s Wei Feng?”</p><p>The old man’s patience wore thin. “You know Gou Wuyue but don’t recognize me?”</p><p>“I’m God of Killing, Wei Feng!” he shouted back.</p><p>“Who the hell is this… Ah…”</p><p>Before he could finish, his head was severed by the broadsword known as Yama’s Banquet.</p><p>Wei Feng wiped the blood from his blade on the corpse. He sighed in exasperation and then shook his head as he walked into the inn.</p><p>Behind him, someone slapped their forehead.</p><p>“D*mn it! I know who he is now. He’s playing Wei Feng, the God of Killing, from the Three Emperors!”</p><p>“Haha, then he nailed it. He went straight to killing without a word!”</p><p>This person seemed to handle killing as effortlessly as chopping vegetables and didn’t look like someone to mess with.</p><p>But dead bodies were common in the Southern Region. If these three could make it through tomorrow, they’d be considered quite capable.</p><p>For now, the most interesting scene was still inside the inn.</p><p>The trio from the Holy Divine Palace…</p><p>Saint Servant…</p><p>Something big was bound to happen!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
