He had successfully crossed two regions!</p><p>“So this is the Spatial Upanishad…”</p><p>“Look! The one in the lead is the Seven Sword Deity, Feng Tingchen! Oh, he’s from the previous batch.”</p><p>“Is that Elder Yang? I’ve seen his portrait before, the old Sword Deity with the goatee, from the same generation as Master Siren?”</p><p>“And that young man?”</p><p>“I don’t know, but it’s not important.”</p><p>“Yes, yes. Someone from the Feng family has arrived. The Sword Deity battle can begin now!”</p><p>…</p><p>The scene in Jade Capital City was vibrant, while the dilapidated battlefield outside the city was a stark contrast, leaving Feng Zhongzui stunned.</p><p>Feng Family City was also thriving.</p><p>But when compared to a large place like the capital, it was like a small fish in a big pond.</p><p>“Master Siren.”</p><p>As soon as Feng Tingchen appeared, he cupped his fists and bowed to Mei Siren, while also indicating the young man behind him.</p><p>“Oh, hello, Master Siren. I’ve admired you for a long time!” Feng Zhongzui greeted as he took out a small mirror from his spatial ring.</p><p>He was mindful of his role, sharing the scene and his awe with everyone across the five regions so they could also experience the moment.</p><p>He paused.</p><p>With his wet hair slightly tousled by the wind, his Sword Will spread out and flowed into the Dao Imparting Mirror.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The city was filled with cheers.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt the tremor of several swords around him. He turned around with surprise in his eyes.</p><p>“Sovereign of the Way of the Sword?”</p><p>Mei Siren looked over as well, intrigued by this promising young talent.</p><p>Feng Zhongzui’s Sword Will carried a unique sense of freedom as if he had never truly cared about the world, including his greeting to Mei Siren.</p><p>Respect was given, but to him, the primary focus was on his task, the Dao Imparting Mirror couldn’t be neglected!</p><p>“Feng Zhongzui, a descendant of the Feng family. This young man is quite mischievous. I brought him here to temper his character,” Feng Tingchen introduced with a smile.</p><p>“How old?” Mei Siren asked, pulling out his fan.</p><p>“Sixteen.”</p><p>“Good!” With a flick of the fan, the words “A promising child is worth teaching” appeared.</p><p>Feng Tingchen’s eyes narrowed in response.</p><p>A sixteen-year-old Sovereign of the Way of the Sword… Xu Xiaoshou was momentarily taken aback. Setting himself aside, this was the age of Xiao Wanfeng and the realization of Su Qianqian’s talent!</p><p>At the very least, being a Sovereign of the Way of the Sword meant he was qualified to challenge the Seven Sword Deity. Given his background in the Feng family, how could he not be well-versed in the Way of the Sword?</p><p>The Sovereign of the Way of the Sword, like the Spiritual Cultivation Sovereign, encompassed three minor realms.</p><p>Sword Deity could also be considered Sovereign of the Way of the Sword. Even before becoming a Saint, Master Siren, who could defeat Jiang Buyi, could be counted among the Sovereign of the Way of the Sword.</p><p>This realm was deep and complex!</p><p>There were many hidden people, each one wanting to be an unexpected contender. It wasn’t until they made their move that one could truly gauge their abilities.</p><p>“Not bad!” Xu Xiaoshou remarked sincerely, “He is indeed a good talent.”</p><p>Feng Tingchen’s expression grew odd.</p><p>This young man spoke with such old-fashioned words…</p><p>He didn’t recognize the white-haired, nine-tailed youth but found his face somewhat familiar, probably from a portrait he had seen somewhere.</p><p>From the battle’s atmosphere, the opponents of the Northern Sword Deity were all dependent on this youth.</p><p>He was Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>“This is my student, Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>Mei Siren indicated with just a name, no further description needed.</p><p>Feng Tingchen’s expression became solemn as he cupped his fists and nodded in respect.</p><p>“Lord Shou?”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui’s eyes lit up, directing the mirror toward the legendary figure.</p><p>At this moment, the ethereal image in the Dao Imparting Mirrors across the five domains of the continent solidified.</p><p>…</p><p>In the Eight Palaces.</p><p>The Feng Family had set up an additional Dao Imparting Mirror in this small town specifically because Lord Shou came from the Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>At this moment, the Eight Palaces were bustling with activity.</p><p>Tiansang City’s Fu Xing and Fu Yanhong, along with their accompanying elders…</p><p>The Tiansang Spirit Palace’s Qiao Qianzhi and Xiao Qixiu, as well as all the Inner Yard disciples, had gathered to watch and learn, including Zhao Xidong, Rao Yinyin, and Tan Ji…</p><p>People from nearby Spirit Palaces and counties and cities who could make it were also present. The crowd was so dense that it was almost chaotic.</p><p>“What a huge change…” Zhao Xidong muttered, still chewing on a blade of grass, staring in disbelief at the mirror. He could hardly believe that the white-haired, nine-tailed figure was once Xu Xiaoshou, who had blown up the Spiritual Library Division.</p><p>“I almost couldn’t recognize him.” The main body of Tan Ji, who was the substitute “Xiao Shi Tan Ji,” said that he didn’t know this guy at all. Even though he had been questioned multiple times by the Holy Divine Palace due to this person’s nonsense.</p><p>“Jade Capital City…” Rao Yinyin gazed at the Dao Imparting Mirror, observing the influential figures around Xu Xiaoshou. Her eyes dimmed as she quietly reminded herself, “You still owe me a Sovereign Pill…”</p><p>Fu Xing pointed at the figure in the mirror, both annoyed and relieved. “I knew he was no ordinary person!”</p><p>Fu Yanhong glared at him, well aware that her brother would have something less than favorable to say.</p><p>Fu Xing smiled again, “Fortunately, you didn’t end up with him. It’s not ideal for my husband to be too powerful. I feel relieved now.”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Fu Xing sighed, “Sigh, after hearing so many legends, I can finally see him in action. It’s a pity we didn’t get to see the Eighth Sword Deity…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
