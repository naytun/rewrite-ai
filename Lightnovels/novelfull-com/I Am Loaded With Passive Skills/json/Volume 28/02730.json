What a beautiful mermaid!”</p><p>in Jade Capital City, everyone seemed to have been temporarily captivated by the sight of this incomparably beautiful star sea mermaid.</p><p>When the four Saints in the city saw it, it triggered a memory.</p><p>“Star Shark sacred physique!”</p><p>The Path Division Chief Yu Zhiwen had always been known for her unique Divine Secret technique.</p><p>However, it was only at this moment that everyone remembered that she was the descendant of the Kun Peng God, Elder Yu.</p><p>The deep sea hid great mysteries!</p><p>Not only could it give birth to a Kun Peng Saint like Elder Yu, but there was also the ancient and rare blood inheritance of the Star Shark.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s uniqueness didn’t stop there.</p><p>As soon as the sacred physique of the Star Shark was activated, her form changed. In the sea of stars around her, a shoal of starfish leapt about.</p><p>These fish were of different sizes.</p><p>The smallest one was smaller than a goldfish, and the largest one was illusory and transparent. It seemed to be the phantom of the Kunpeng!</p><p>The sea of stars shook and suddenly condensed into a huge sea beast that covered the sky. It had wings on its back and was covered in water and clouds.</p><p>Saint Statue, Kunpeng!</p><p>All the Saints, including Fang Wenxin, were moved at this change in such a short period of time.</p><p>The bloodline power of the Kun Peng race was so powerful.</p><p>If he also had such a bloodline and such a sacred physique, why would he be afraid of Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>With the Blood Shadow copper coins, he would be able to pursue the Nine-Tailed Giant!</p><p>“Woo!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen, who was in the form of the Star Shark, raised her head and let out a long moan. The frequency of this strange chant seemed to match Elder Yu’s.</p><p>In mid-air, Elder Yu, who was in his Kun body, collided head on and slowed down slightly.</p><p>At this moment, Yu Zhiwen borrowed the power of the Holy Blood and the Saint Statue and released a burst of dazzling starlight from her Pearl Gem Star Eyes.</p><p>She controlled the shattered Xuanji great array and repaired everything at an extreme speed that did not match her strength.</p><p>Jade Capital City’s barrier was rebuilt in the form of a curtain of water.</p><p>It emerged from the ground, crossed the tall buildings, rose into the air, and finally quickly closed at the highest point.</p><p>Under Yu Zhiwen’s control, countless divine path patterns were reconstructed and layers of protection were pulled open!</p><p>The four Saints reacted in unison…</p><p>The intention behind Yu Zhiwen’s impromptu action was to restart the Xuanji great array and protect Jade Capital City in this tragic battle.</p><p>“You must block it!”</p><p>Amid the sea of stars, Yu Zhiwen’s eyes were filled with worry.</p><p>In the sky, Ye Xiaotian was the first to respond as he activated the Power Upanishad Formation beneath his feet.</p><p>“Outer World!”</p><p>The world suddenly changed.</p><p>The battlefield split into two.</p><p>It was clearly right in front of him, but it was as if there were countless planes in between.</p><p>“Let me help too.”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi followed closely behind. A slightly illusory Great Path Diagram appeared under his feet, and his entire body was dyed green.</p><p>It was as if his form had been transformed from the inside and he turned into a jade statue with an afro.</p><p>“God Jade Statue!”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi’s body rippled with Holy Power. He reached out with difficulty and pressed his hand on Jade Capital City’s Xuanji great array.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The entire water curtain barrier instantly became as solid as a rock.</p><p>“Jade attribute…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen looked back in surprise.</p><p>She had once seen a female senior in the Path Division who also had this attribute, but she could not use it to fight at all. She could only cultivate in the direction of auxiliary healing.</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi’s jade attribute seemed to have a higher defense than the earth attribute and gold attribute?</p><p>“Falling Flower World.”</p><p>Mei Siren suddenly pulled out his sword, and the sword image behind him rose.</p><p>Jade Capital City that had transformed into jade, under the fluttering red plum blossoms turned reality into illusion and was placed onto a nameless site.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>On the horizon, Elder Yu had just heard his precious great-granddaughter’s voice and realized that something was wrong. He had only just retracted some of his strength.</p><p>In the vortex of the ghostly energy, the Nine-Tailed Giant’s punch, that had too many layers of additional power stacked on it, took the opportunity to advance.</p><p>It transcended space and time and smashed into his head that was in the form of a Kun body.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>As soon as they came into contact, a loud bang exploded in the Nine Heavens. In an instant, the whole world fell silent.</p><p>The gray destructive airflow that exploded completely solidified and quickly attacked in all directions in the form of shock waves.</p><p>Chi Chi Sizzle…</p><p>The golden osmanthus trees on the highway were directly destroyed. After the road outside the city exploded, it was slowly obliterated along with the wind and snow.</p><p>The greenery on the mountain range in the distance was also gradually swallowed by the gray airflow. Then, even the mountains melted away like the ice and snow.</p><p>The red plum blossoms that drifted down on Jade Capital City were shredded by the sword energy under the violent resistance.</p><p>Even the Azure Mo Swords within the sword image could not completely block this sudden attack.</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>Mei Siren spat out blood.</p><p>The body of an ancient swordsman was far too fragile, even more so than that of a Spiritual Cultivator.</p><p>He was knocked out of his form by the Path Principles. His face was pale and he was forced back by the gray airflow in the sky.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>As soon as Mei Siren retreated, Jade Capital City turned from virtual to real.</p><p>The second person to suffer was Zhong Yuanzi!</p><p>After being attacked by the gray airflow, the jade water barrier cracked rapidly and finally exploded into pieces.</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi grunted as blood seeped out from the corners of his lips.</p><p>He was an Elemental Divine Envoy, not an ancient martial arts envoy. When this self-created Saint Martial Arts spiritual technique shattered, he immediately suffered a huge backlash.</p><p>Fortunately, Mei Siren had already taken the biggest blow. His injuries weren’t serious, and as long as he retreated, he would recover quickly.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian stood at the edge of the city on his Spatial Upanishad array diagram. His hands were clasped behind his back and his expression was proud and arrogant.</p><p>The surging gray airflow had broken through the defense of the first and second Saints. However, it could not break through the defense of his Outer World!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
