They were too shocked.</p><p>The mighty Saint Servant Lord Shou was meowing like a cat in public!</p><p>It was too ridiculous.</p><p>It was a stark contrast to his grand image of battling Dao Xuanji and resisting the Kun Peng God.</p><p>“Is this what the side effect of becoming a ghost beast looks like?”</p><p>“Also, when it comes to being a host, the ghost beast is the main entity, and the host body is just supplementary.”</p><p>“Why is it that after the contract is made, Xu Xiaoshou’s will still dominates? The Greedy the Cat Spirit has minimal influence on him and only meows occasionally?”</p><p>The lower-ranked people were enjoying the spectacle. They couldn’t escape anyway, so if things went wrong, Demi-Saint Ye would handle it.</p><p>They watched as Xu Xiaoshou, who was vexed by his tail, shouting and cursing at himself, and meowing from time to time in the sky. They found it quite amusing.</p><p>“Becoming a ghost beast seems pretty entertaining?”</p><p>Some of the more forward-thinking individuals began to contemplate the future of the Shengshen Continent. It would become the future of the ghost beast!</p><p>Without a doubt, since Kui Leihan of the Ten High Nobles established the Penetrating Divine Senses and led an era, the world had been in upheaval.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s actions had opened up a new path for cultivation.</p><p>He demonstrated that ghost beasts were not to be feared.</p><p>The contract was easy to succeed, and one wouldn’t die from it. One could even become the dominant force in the ghost beast’s will, rather than being possessed as everyone had imagined.</p><p>If the side effect was just meowing, it was something anyone could accept.</p><p>The key question was whether Xu Xiaoshou’s combat strength could significantly improve in his ghost beast form. If he could…</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>In the sky, Lord Shou suddenly went berserk.</p><p>He was pulling out the white tail behind him and making forceful meows to stop himself.</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators with foresight were left dumbfounded.</p><p>They wondered if his combat strength could see a major increase.</p><p>It seemed funny…</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I have a question.” Fang Wenxin looked over seriously.</p><p>As a first-generation red-clothed people, his understanding of ghost beasts was far beyond that of the ignorant citizens of Jade Capital City.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou contracted with the ghost beast, he should have stopped him. This was out of the Red-clothed people’s compassion, not wanting to see him bear too much.</p><p>But now that he had successfully transformed into a ghost beast and could still maintain his own will as the primary force, Fang Wenxin had to reconsider his approach.</p><p>Hearing this, Xu Xiaoshou momentarily gave up fighting the excited Greedy the Cat Spirit in his mind and addressed Fang Wenxin, “Senior Fang, meow! Uh… Please go ahead…”</p><p>The surroundings fell silent in an instant.</p><p>The sudden meowing made even Lord Shou give up struggling, and everyone gradually chose to accept it.</p><p>Fang Wenxin looked at the young man.</p><p>He could easily tell that Xu Xiaoshou was still rational and not pretending. The transformation into a ghost beast host body had little effect on him.</p><p>All of this seemed to have originated from Xu Xiaoshou’s modified special Ghost Beast Contract.</p><p>“Your Ghost Beast Contract doesn’t seem to come from Xu Yue Grey Palace, but rather you created it yourself?” Fang Wenxin asked.</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>As soon as Xu Xiaoshou spoke, his anger flared up. “Shut up, d*mn it!”</p><p>“I wasn’t talking about you, senior…” He looked at Fang Wenxin apologetically. “Yes, it’s… meow that I created it.”</p><p>That one sentence threw Jade Capital City into chaos and joy.</p><p>“Surprised. Passive Points: +9999.”</p><p>“Mocked, Passive Points: +9999.”</p><p>“Liked. Passive Points: +3666.”</p><p>Fang Wenxin wanted to say more, but Xu Xiaoshou shifted his focus and said with a faint smile, “Senior Fang, don’t tell me you want me to generously contribute this Ghost Beast Contract to the Holy Divine Palace… Teach it to all the… meow… in the world?”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, his facial muscles twitched violently, and tears flickered in his eyes.</p><p>His esteemed reputation!</p><p>He held back his shame, wiped away the tears, and glared at Fang Wenxin.</p><p>He could have discussed this calmly, but now he was angry at everyone!</p><p>Fang Wenxin was momentarily speechless.</p><p>He had indeed had such thoughts earlier.</p><p>In front of Xu Xiaoshou, he didn’t even need to say anything to understand his thoughts.</p><p>He heard the other party chuckle and then meow. His face turned ashen as he said, “Actually, it’s possible. As long as Senior Fang leaves the Holy Divine Palace, and joins the First Pavilion in the Sky, we can meow… Alright, we can teach the world the Ghost Beast Contract!”</p><p>Fang Wenxin quickly understood his meaning.</p><p>After Xu Xiaoshou contracted with Greedy the Cat Spirit, he wondered if Greedy the Cat Spirit’s rationality also returned.</p><p>Both seemed to be in perfect condition and could even engage in deep self-conscious conversations.</p><p>In other words…</p><p>“Did Xu Xiaoshou have to add the Body of Devour to his talents?”</p><p>“This is impossible.” Fang Wenxin firmly denied it. He wouldn’t make a mistake on principle matters.</p><p>“Hahaha, if I were Dao Xuanji, you would already be doomed. You failed to capture Greedy the Cat Spirit and allowed me, Xu Xiaoshou, to contract with a ghost beast. Afterward, you even discussed these rebellious matters in front of everyone…” Xu Xiaoshou sneered. “You’d have to break both your arms, meow!”</p><p>Jade Capital City erupted.</p><p>This Veiled Insinuation was spot-on.</p><p>This was akin to mocking the Sacred Mountain and criticizing its earlier punishment of the Moonless Sword Deity.</p><p>After cursing Greedy the Cat Spirit in his mind, Xu Xiaoshou continued, “Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe can’t accommodate outsiders. It can’t tolerate even half of another surname. Senior Fang’s surname is Fang. Sooner or later, something will go wrong, meow…”</p><p>“Whoosh! Why not join my First Pavilion in the Sky? You and I can freely study the ghost beast. Once we have results, we can share them with the world and benefit the five regions. Why not, meow?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
