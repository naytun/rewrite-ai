If the nine tails and the vortex of ghostly energy were removed…</p><p>Did he not resemble the giant version of Xu Xiaoshou who tore apart the Holy Emperor Qilin?</p><p>Bad memories flooded back in her mind!</p><p>Beibei had almost forgotten about the matter of the Holy Emperor Qilin.</p><p>When she saw the Nine-Tailed Giant, she lowered her eyes and saw the letter of invitation in her hand.</p><p>She fell silent.</p><p>Am I really going to challenge this guy?</p><p>Even if Xu Xiaoshou had agreed to fight in the style of an ancient swordsman and fought with true fire during the battle, he had unleashed such a form…</p><p>“Can I still survive this?”</p><p>Beibei suddenly felt she had a headache.</p><p>She didn’t understand the logic behind Hallmaster Xuanji’s decision that she challenge such a monster!</p><p>If it was Hallmaster Dao…</p><p>He would definitely have another way, right?</p><p>As she turned around, she saw the two ancient swordman behind her. Li Fuyu’s expression appeared calm and unmoved.</p><p>On the contrary, Old Senior Gu Yu’s face was solemn and he was hesitant.</p><p>Beibei did not even need to ask what his thoughts were at the moment. It should be similar to hers.</p><p>“You can reconsider this.”</p><p>Beibei would never force others to do something that she herself didn’t want to do, or that she might not be able to complete even if she wanted to.</p><p>Li Fuyu looked into the void and did not answer.</p><p>Gu Yu hesitated. After he looked away from Mei Siren’s figure, he sighed.</p><p>“A pair of old bones…”</p><p>“But whether or not it will work, we have to give it a try.”</p><p>Beibei was surprised.</p><p>He still wanted to fight?</p><p>Was Senior Gu Yu really that fearless, or was he simply blinded by his semi-saint person?</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>She did not try to persuade him anymore.</p><p>She looked up into the sky and waited quietly.</p><p>In this state, Xu Xiaoshou could not be challenged at all.</p><p>She could only hope that he would regain his rationality soon!</p><p>In front of the vortex of ghostly energy.</p><p>Elder Yu, who had transformed into a kun, was punched in the head.</p><p>For the first time in his life, he had lost in terms of physical strength to someone who wasn’t even a demi-saint.</p><p>This shocked Elder Yu!</p><p>In his impression, the only person who could compete with him in terms of physical strength was probably that kid called The Divine, but he had never fought with him before.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had caught up from behind and also reached this height?</p><p>“Nine-Tailed Giant…”</p><p>With a swish, Elder Yu retracted his Kun body and did not attack again. He returned to Fang Wenxin’s side.</p><p>“I can’t defeat him.”</p><p>He admitted this candidly.</p><p>When he received Little Yu’s message earlier, he knew that he had been impulsive again. He should not have tried this.</p><p>Fortunately, Ye Xiaotian managed to defend Jade Capital City in the end. Otherwise, he would have been the culprit who destroyed the capital.</p><p>“Thank you for your help.”</p><p>Elder Yu nodded at Ye Xiaotian before he turned to look at Fang Wenxin.</p><p>He pointed at the Nine-Tailed Giant in the vortex of ghostly energy and with a somber expression gave a detailed evaluation of the collision just now.</p><p>“It can’t be forcefully shaken, can’t be stopped, and can’t be separated by ordinary people!”</p><p>“In my opinion, unless Xu Xiaoshou failed to contract the ghost beast, even if we attack together, the one who will suffer will only be Jade Capital City, not him.”</p><p>After a pause, Elder Yu continued.</p><p>“Don’t forget, his recovery ability is very strong.”</p><p>“My attack just now did not even cause much damage to him. His condition…”</p><p>Elder Yu clicked his tongue and shook his head vigorously. “It’s really hard to evaluate!”</p><p>Fang Wenxin fell silent.</p><p>He knew that when even Elder Yu said these words, there was nothing they could do to save the situation. There was no way to stop Xu Xiaoshou from contracting the ghost beast.</p><p>“I understand.”</p><p>Fang Wenxin nodded and put away the nine Blood Shadow copper coins.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had chosen his own path.</p><p>His only hope now was that this guy wasn’t merely talking nonsense. He could really reach a height that he could not attain!</p><p>“Don’t mess around!”</p><p>Elder Yu advised him seriously…</p><p>His old face trembled as he rushed to Yu Zhiwen’s side. His face was filled with worry as he said.</p><p>“Oh dear, my little sweetheart!”</p><p>“How are you? Are you hurt?”</p><p>“Sigh, I told you not to mess around. It’s all that Fang Wenxin’s fault. Xu Xiaoshou made a contract with a ghost beast, so be it. What did it have to do with us? We’re just meddling in other people’s affairs…”</p><p>“Oh, okay, okay. If you don’t want to talk about it, then it’s fine. Grandpa Yu won’t bring this up anymore. It’s good that you’re fine!”</p><p>“Later, Grandpa Yu will catch a few big crabs for you to build up your body. Then, we can go to the Cold Palace secret realm or return to the Southern Underworld… The Southern Underworld is more fun!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen, whose lips were pale, held a large pile of bottles and jars in her arms. Not only were there all kinds of rare Elixirs, but there were also Holy Blood from the various races.</p><p>However, Elder Yu’s deep love could not make her turn back.</p><p>She even forgot to retract her sacred physique, the Star Shark. Grandpa Yu’s evaluation still echoed in her mind as she stared at the Nine-Tailed Giant.</p><p>Since there was no way to turn back…</p><p>She had to succeed!</p><p>Within the vortex of ghostly energy.</p><p>The sudden extreme transformation of the Ultimate Giant was not part of Xu Xiaoshou’s plan at all.</p><p>A punch was thrown.</p><p>In just a few breaths, he felt that he was about to be drained dry again.</p><p>Although the Nine-Tailed Giant still had the strength to fight the Kunpeng, this came as a pleasant surprise.</p><p>However, the after effects of the fight with the Holy Emperor Qilin were still fresh in his mind. Xu Xiaoshou did not want to experience that state of exhaustion again.</p><p>“Come back!”</p><p>With the help of the Spirit Awakening, he forcefully roused himself from his frenzied state and also Greedy the Cat Spirit, who affected his mental state constantly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
