With the help of the recoil, she rushed into Jade Capital City.</p><p>“Buzz.”</p><p>The space didn’t budge and there was no easy way out.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pulled out the severed roots of the God Worship Willow Tree from his palm, rolled it into a ball, and threw it into the Apricot Realm.</p><p>He laughed as he appeared in front of Dao Xuanji and placed his recently healed hand on the old woman’s shoulder.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Countless willow branches bounced off Dao Xuanji’s shoulders.</p><p>However, this did not affect Xu Xiaoshou. Instead, she was sent flying into the buildings in the city.</p><p>The people who watched the battle felt as if they had been hit by a cannonball. Everyone scrambled and fled in a hurry.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>“They’re headed our way! Run, run!”</p><p>“D*mn it, so this is how it feels to be in such close proximity with Lord Shou. That smile of his… F*ck, it’s too terrifying!”</p><p>“If I were Hallmaster Xuanji, I would have nightmares tonight!”</p><p>“Bullsh*t! Hallmaster Xuanji can’t defeat him at all. She’s doomed!”</p><p>As everyone watched in shock, Xu Xiaoshou leaned nearer to Dao Xuanji. He was about to attack again when he felt that something was not quite right.</p><p>Even if Dao Xuanji was afraid of him, why would she show such fear on the surface?</p><p>As expected, when he looked at Dao Xuanji, who had crashed into the building, he saw no panic, only mockery.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you’re finished!”</p><p>Weng!</p><p>The Celestial Scroll unfolded.</p><p>Jade Capital City’s Xuanji great array lit up with a blazing light, as it resonated from afar with the great array that protected the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>“Swish, swish, swish…”</p><p>In the sky, the phantoms of the Dead Sea suddenly appeared. Then hundreds and thousands of people clad in prison uniforms fell from the sky.</p><p>All of these people looked ferocious and their cultivation levels were extremely high and they gave off overwhelming baleful auras. They were all at the Cutting Path Stage or higher void level.</p><p>Among them, there were all kinds of spiritual beasts and fierce beasts that seemed devoid of any rationality. They had powerful cultivation levels, but they could only roar.</p><p>“Respects to the Ancestral Tree, God Worship Willow Tree!”</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s figure vanished and reappeared in the sky.</p><p>After her shout, with a whoosh, thousands of willow branches shot out from the ground of Jade Capital City. They pierced through the air and interweaved into a net.</p><p>Without exception, the willow branches pierced through the prisoners from the Dead Sea and devoured their flesh, blood and souls in an instant.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils trembled.</p><p>He finally understood what Dragon Apricot spoke about.</p><p>Just a moment ago, they were still alive and resembled ferocious beasts, but in an instant, their bodies had turned totally black.</p><p>They hung by their waists on the willow branches and swayed along. Their upper bodies seemed to bow toward Dao Xuanji.</p><p>This was the true God Worship Willow Tree?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have realized something and looked around.</p><p>They didn’t dare to touch the people of Jade Capital City, and they couldn’t touch the many Spiritual Cultivators and Saints in the city. Yet, they dared to touch the Dead Sea’s…</p><p>Indeed!</p><p>From this point of view, weren’t the prisoners that came from the Dead Sea the best nutrients for the God Worship Willow Tree?</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>High up in the sky, Dao Xuanji couldn’t help but let out an extremely satisfied moan.</p><p>There were nearly a thousand Sovereign Stage Spiritual Cultivators and beasts. The blood, flesh, vitality, and soul power that they had brought to her almost replenished what she had just lost.</p><p>Even under the transformation of the refined essence of the God Worship Willow Tree, there was still progress!</p><p>With this, Dao Xuanji almost recovered to her peak state.</p><p>Other than the fact that she had chosen to coexist with the God Worship Willow Tree and not have a master-servant relationship, she could be said to have…</p><p>Started over!</p><p>“This is your trump card?”</p><p>Under Jade Capital City, Xu Xiaoshou looked over from afar, and a hint of mockery appeared on his lips.</p><p>In his line of sight, Dao Xuanji was not the same Hallmaster Xuanji who had been in a good state.</p><p>He didn’t even need to use the Life Dao Disc…</p><p>He could clearly see that Dao Xuanji’s life patterns flowed with power that did not belong to her.</p><p>The influx of this external force created a temporary illusion of fullness.</p><p>However, just like Elixirs and Holy Blood…</p><p>It was external after all, and it was the complete opposite of what she had cultivated.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you are already on the road to death!”</p><p>Dao Xuanji couldn’t be bothered to waste any more words. She knew that even if there was a chance to turn the tables, she absolutely couldn’t fight with this person.</p><p>She made a seal with both hands, and the Celestial Scroll under her feet swirled. The surrounding Xuanji great array transformed into mottled but powerful divine path patterns…</p><p>Everyone in the city was shocked.</p><p>Lei Xi’er looked at Xu Xiaoshou from afar and found that he was still very confident, as if he was not afraid of what Dao Xuanji’s future plans were.</p><p>“Wait a moment.”</p><p>She stretched her hand out and stopped Lei Shuangxing, Mei Siren, and the others from moving forward.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian raised an eyebrow when he saw this and stopped in his tracks as well. He then turned to look at Xu Xiaoshou’s feet with envy and jealousy-the Power Upanishad Formation there shone as brightly as his did!</p><p>“Life…”</p><p>As soon as the Unity of Man and the Heavens was activated, Xu Xiaoshou felt that the world had turned clearer.</p><p>At this moment, he forgot that Dao Xuanji had cast a spell, forgot about the attention of everyone around him, and even forgot about the existence of Jade Capital City.</p><p>In his eyes, there was only the life force in Dao Xuanji’s body that didn’t belong to her.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>He bent his knees and positioned himself in a horse stance.</p><p>On the streets of Jade Capital City, there were only the slight sounds of the falling snow and dust.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes narrowed as he shouted.</p><p>“Human Realm Dao!”</p><p>With a whoosh, the airflow in the sky was split apart.</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s hand seals had yet to form when she realized that the vitality she had just borrowed had completely disappeared!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
