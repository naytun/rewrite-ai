Who?” Feng Tingchen turned his head to look. Among the younger generation of the family, he liked Feng Zhongzui the most. He was straightforward and fearless, with no pretense of divinity. He was a natural-born ancient swordsman.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian shook his head and didn’t reply, thinking to himself that soon enough, he would get to see him.</p><p>“Shall we go now?” he changed the topic.</p><p>“Sure.” Feng Tingchen nodded. With everyone already gathered, it was ideal that Demi-Saint Ye didn’t mind Feng Zhongzui.</p><p>“Then let’s go!” Ye Xiaotian turned to look at Elder Yang, who nodded in agreement.</p><p>He then looked at Feng Zhongzui…</p><p>The young man was still hunched over, ignoring the presence of the bosses around him. He kept his head lowered, staring intently at the ground.</p><p>“Do you have something else to do?” Ye Xiaotian’s lips curled into a smile.</p><p>“Oh, no! No! Let’s go. Forget about him.” Feng Zhongzui suddenly realized that these influential figures were waiting for him, and he was greatly unsettled.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian smiled and didn’t press further. He activated the Spatial Upanishad array diagram beneath his feet and said, “Be careful, the three of you.”</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The Power Upanishad Formation appeared and vanished quickly.</p><p>The people of Feng Family City looked up as the four figures in the sky transformed into faint lights and were about to disappear.</p><p>At that moment, just as the teleportation was nearly complete…</p><p>Feng Zhongzui, who hadn’t given up searching, suddenly fixed his gaze on the enormous Dao Imparting Mirror on the first viewing platform.</p><p>He jumped up with excitement, covering his mouth with one hand and shaking his wine bag with the other. Most hysterically, he shouted, “Hahaha, Xiao Wanfeng, I found you!”</p><p>“Stay right there and watch my valiant figure in the Dao Imparting Mirror. Don’t fall in love with me later!”</p><p>“When I return, don’t forget our agreement… A drink in front of the Flower Moon Tower, to test the sword in your chest! You will become famous! When that time comes, I will be…”</p><p>“Ugh, don’t hurt my ears! It hurts!”</p><p>The phenomenon of spatial teleportation vanished, and there were no traces of the figures in the sky.</p><p>The well-trained Feng Family City finally erupted in long-suppressed excitement.</p><p>“Spatial Upanishad! Demi-Saint Ye is incredible. He transported the old family head with just his power. Amazing.”</p><p>“I didn’t expect the old family head to personally oversee the battle between Lord Shou and Northern Sword Deity. Elder Yang also joined in. The Dao Imparting Mirror is going to be full of Sword Deities later!”</p><p>“I heard that Master Siren will also be there! I’ve long admired Master Siren. He wields the Taicheng Sword, which belonged to Elder You Tu’s saber. So Elder You Tu must also be present!”</p><p>“I heard that Lord Shou has blocked the entrance to the Central Region’s capital. I can finally see the battlefield. I’m so looking forward to it…”</p><p>At the first viewing platform, in front of the Dao Imparting Mirror.</p><p>The discussion wasn’t limited to big shots. Some people noticed the details as well.</p><p>In the final moments, Feng Zhongzui was shouting and staring at this place…</p><p>“By the way, who has the Young Master Zui recently befriended? Xiao Wanfeng? I’ve never heard of him. Is he also an ancient swordsman?”</p><p>“Young Master Zui makes friends every day. He once stayed drunk at the Flower Moon Tower for three months. If you count him as a friend, then all corners of the world are his friends, haha!”</p><p>“He’s quite a character. I’ve had a drink with him before. I’m not exaggerating. He has a deep understanding and cultivates the sword with great passion. If he had been born a few years earlier, he might have made it to the Seven Sword Deity this year!”</p><p>“It’s hard to say. He’s too young, but he said Xiao Wanfeng would become famous. I’ve rarely heard Young Master Zui give such high praise, especially in front of Demi-Saint Ye, the old family head, and everyone in Feng Family City!”</p><p>“Who is Xiao Wanfeng? Could you stand up?”</p><p>Everyone around, holding their swords, looked around but couldn’t find the person.</p><p>Indeed, for the renowned “Young Master Zui” of Feng Family City, Xiao Wanfeng was practically unknown.</p><p>Among the nearby ancient swordsman factions, there didn’t seem to be any prominent family with the surname ‘Xiao.’</p><p>But soon, everyone’s focus shifted back from Young Master Zui’s shout before he left to the Dao Imparting Mirror.</p><p>The huge mirror lit up as Demi-Saint Ye disappeared!</p><p>Initially, there was a rustling sound with blurry image particles, floating above everyone’s heads like a mirage.</p><p>Soon after, the scene inside became clear, showing a grand and prosperous city. Snow was falling from the sky, and laurel trees swayed in the wind.</p><p>The fragrance seemed to travel from the Central Region to the first viewing platform of Feng Family City in the Southern Region.</p><p>“Look!”</p><p>“It’s Jade Capital City!”</p><p>“What a huge city!”</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were instantly captivated, their faces flushed with excitement as they stared at the Dao Imparting Mirror and watched the figures appear on it.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng turned to look.</p><p>Unlike everyone else, he remained a bit dazed, still immersed in</p><p>Young Master Zui’s shouts.</p><p>“I will become famous?”</p><p>Back then, Xiao Wanfeng had only happened to pass by the Flower Moon Tower. He was momentarily distracted by the elegantly dressed girls, and then Young Master Zui jumped down from three stories up and dragged him inside for a forced drink.</p><p>Yet, it was just a drink. Young Master Zui chatted freely and made a promise of “a meal of wine, a sword in the chest.”</p><p>He was even so certain of his success.</p><p>He even knew…</p><p>“Young Master Xu knows me, Young Master Zui knows me, but I don’t know myself.”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng looked at the familiar yet unfamiliar figure of the nine-tailed black-robed youth that finally appeared in the Dao Imparting Mirror.</p><p>That figure drew cheers from the crowd!</p><p>The world seemed to isolate itself from him, and the cheers gradually faded away.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng remained in a daze, his hand slowly resting on his chest where the sword intent was boiling, almost bursting out.</p><p>“Xuan Cang, can I do this?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
