It should contain the power of a Holy Emperor. No wonder he could take a punch from my Ultimate Giant!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts settled. He suddenly remembered that Elder Yu was still in his human form.</p><p>In the previous few attacks, he had only summoned the phantoms of the Kun and Peng bodies…</p><p>He had kept it too well hidden!</p><p>This old fellow was even deeper than the deep sea!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou even saw specks of starlight around the moon…</p><p>It was a mermaid whose tail trailed among the sea of stars. Her facial features were exquisite, and her skin was as white as snow. She was breathtakingly beautiful.</p><p>“Mermaid…”</p><p>“No, it’s Little Yu?”</p><p>It was only when he saw the pair of Pearl Gem Star Eyes that Xu Xiaoshou recognized the mermaid’s identity and almost left his state of epiphany.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen, Yu Zhiwen…</p><p>So after the sacred physique was liberated, it was really a fish, but not a little goldfish, but a mermaid?</p><p>Something did not seem quite right!</p><p>Since she had inherited the Kunpeng bloodline, he thought that she would also transform into that kind of Kunpeng…</p><p>However, when he thought of the ferocious and enormous sea beast Kun body that appeared after Elder Yu’s transformation.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought for a moment and decided to forget about the Kunpeng. This mermaid, or rather, the Star Shark’s sacred physique that they had mentioned, was quite good!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s life diagram was a little special.</p><p>Hers differed from outsiders, and was also different from her Grandpa Yu. It was like a divine spiritual array that was embedded in two layers.</p><p>“Oh…”</p><p>This time Xu Xiaoshou did not understand.</p><p>He first summarized the conclusion he had just observed and found that the life diagrams of the people in the city were all ordinary.</p><p>Only those with the spiritual physique or special attributes could surpass others in their Life force.</p><p>On the other hand, in the sky, regardless whether it was Mei, Ye, Zhong, Fang or the other people who could enter the game, all their life diagrams were more exquisite.</p><p>Soon, he understood.</p><p>“The level of life of a spiritual physique and a sacred physique is higher than that of an ordinary person. This meant that their upper limits were higher.”</p><p>“In essence, they are no longer ‘humans’. Spiritual cultivators were indeed stronger than ordinary humans.”</p><p>“But Yu Zhiwen…”</p><p>Her Divine Secret seemed to have been cultivated to the bone, and she could even separate the life diagrams into two layers.</p><p>Double sacred physique?</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, why did it seem like… an insight?”</p><p>At Jade Capital City, when the Nine-Tailed Giant’s frenzy stopped and the Life Dao Disc under his feet lit up.</p><p>He had gained enlightenment from many living beings, but they also spied on him.</p><p>However…</p><p>Had there been a mistake during the process of the contract with the ghost beast?</p><p>It was either a failure or a success. Why was there still half of the contract that entered the state of enlightenment?</p><p>“It’s an insight indeed!”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi’s eyes focused and he pointed at the Great Path Diagram under the Nine-Tailed Giant’s feet. He said in excitement.</p><p>“This is the Great Path Diagram of Life. I’ve studied the essence of life for a while. He must have entered into a contract with Greedy the Cat Spirit and obtained a large amount of life force. I think he has gained something…”</p><p>“No, not just gained something, he gained a lot!”</p><p>The brilliance of the Great Path Diagram and the complexity of the Dao patterns inside slowly increased with the passage of time.</p><p>This progress was visible to the naked eye, and it also came as an extreme shock.</p><p>Others might not understand, but as an Elemental Divine Envoy, Zhong Yuanzi had studied this on a daily basis. How could he not understand?</p><p>His eyes were ablaze with excitement as he scratched his fluffy afro. His scalp was about to bleed from the incessant scratching, but he still could not get an answer.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“How can his Enlightenment speed be so fast? This doesn’t make sense…”</p><p>“You can receive so much when you contract with the ghost beast in such a short time?”</p><p>Fang Wenxin was so frightened when he heard this. He looked at him and said, “Don’t have any weird ideas!”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi glanced at him but did not answer him directly. He continued to look at the Nine-Tailed Giant in excitement.</p><p>“We have witnessed a miracle of life!”</p><p>Fang Wenxin fell silent.</p><p>He suddenly thought that if Xu Xiaoshou succeeded in the future, he would not answer Zhong Yuanzi’s questions…</p><p>After today, would the Sacred Mountain lose an Elemental Divine Envoy, and would the First Pavilion in the Sky gain an explosive demi-saint?</p><p>“Someone is observing me.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian frowned as he surveyed his surroundings. After he confirmed that there was nothing unusual, he hesitated for a moment before he went on to describe the strange feeling.</p><p>“I had the same feeling!” Mei Siren turned and said in surprise.</p><p>“Was there?” Zhong Yuanzi’s attention was not on this but his expression was wary.</p><p>Fang Wenxin fell silent again. He only felt that something was different, and it was hard to describe.</p><p>Elder Yu looked around and finally fixed his gaze on the Nine-Tailed Giant.</p><p>He tugged Little Yu’s hand. “Did you notice anything unusual?”</p><p>Unusual?</p><p>When she heard that, Yu Zhiwen really felt something was wrong.</p><p>For a moment, she felt as if she had been spied on by someone and thought it was an illusion.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was an introvert and didn’t like to stand out.</p><p>When she was at the Sacred Mountain, her veil had never left her face as she tried to reduce her presence to zero.</p><p>Even so, the number of heads that turned was still very high.</p><p>This time, if it had not been for the life and death of the people of Jade Capital City, she would not have released her sacred physique in front of the world.</p><p>It was easy for some people, such as Xu Xiaoshou, to show off.</p><p>To Yu Zhiwen, it was too difficult. It was a huge breakthrough!</p><p>Now that Grandpa Yu said this, she suddenly noticed that only a small portion of the rumors in Jade Capital city under her feet came from the Nine-Tailed Giant.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
