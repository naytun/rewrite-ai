In a swish, his figure disappeared.</p><p>Fourth Sword stabbed towards the direction where it had rebounded from, but it could only pierce through the air. Dao Xuanji was protected by the three Xuanji Star Officials, so she was sent to the side!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around abruptly.</p><p>At this moment, there was no surprise on his face, only a sinister smile.</p><p>“Run?”</p><p>“Can you run away?”</p><p>It was just that he had used the power of the stars to hide. It was not a pure Vanishing Technique. Even the divine path pattern when casting the technique had appeared.</p><p>Although there was a concealment array formation on it in advance to block the spiritual sense Perception of outsiders.</p><p>However, in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes, the more he tried to cover it up, the more obvious it was!</p><p>He never used spiritual sense, but “Perception”.</p><p>Just in terms of breaking the array, his Weaving Expertise in Divine Secret could be considered to be the best in the world.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The Space Dao Disc beneath his feet spun.</p><p>The three Xuanji Star Officials at the side suddenly removed their invisibility and protected a sneering Dao Xuanji. They each set up a defensive formation.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had disappeared!</p><p>However, he was not teleported to one of the Xuanji Star Officials. Instead, he was teleported behind the three demi-saints, Fang, Yu, and Zhong.</p><p>In the Jade Capital City, everyone was shocked to see Xu Xiaoshou sweep the air and pull out Hallmaster Xuanji, who had a panicked expression!</p><p>“Your technique is too unscrupulous.”</p><p>When this mocking voice bloomed in the sky, everyone realized that the Hallmaster Xuanji who was being protected…</p><p>Was fake!</p><p>“Pufft.”</p><p>As the strange sound was heard, the Space Dao Disc under Xu Xiaoshou’s feet switched to the Fire Path Wheel.</p><p>White flames suddenly appeared in all directions. Including the three Xuanji Star Officials who were not invisible, as well as the fake Dao Xuanji…</p><p>There were exactly 26!</p><p>Only the Dao Xuanji in Xu Xiaoshou’s hand was not on fire.</p><p>“He’s looking for someone!”</p><p>No matter how stupid the Spirit Cultivators in Jade Capital were, they understood what was going on.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou found a way. He used the method of the Infernal lineage to ignite certain Path Principles.</p><p>This Path Principles was most likely the power that the Xuanji Star Official had used to beat Cao Erzhu.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou remembered his Great Path aura!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was stunned.</p><p>She thought the Supreme Master had escaped from the tiger’s mouth…</p><p>She thought Xu Xiaoshou would choose to protect himself this time and would not find trouble with the Supreme Master in the three Xuanji Star Officials…</p><p>She did not expect the Supreme Master to be a fake! And Xu Xiaoshou dared to go up and even found his true body!</p><p>At this moment, Yu Zhiwen was the only one who felt the difference in their battle consciousness. Even Xi, Cao Erzhu, and the others who were watching from afar felt the huge difference.</p><p>It was hard for someone who was not experienced to find so many flaws in such a short time.</p><p>“Flame Python!”</p><p>Fourth Sword that were thrown out but did not return. Xu Xiaoshou grabbed it and pulled out the Flame Sword Flame Python from his back.</p><p>He grabbed Dao Xuanji’s neck and glared at her. As if he was chopping a chicken, his famous sword brushed away the white flames and chopped down from the sky.</p><p>“Pufft.”</p><p>In an instant, twenty-six internal white flames shone on the horizon.</p><p>This included the Xuanji Star Official who had disguised himself as Dao Xuanji and the three people who had appeared around.</p><p>Their right arms transformed into a sharp saber made of starlight. Not only was there Holy Power on it but there was also the aura of the power of the ancestral power…</p><p>No!</p><p>It was not an aura.</p><p>This was truly the Power of Divinity!</p><p>Even the Four Xuanji Star Officials who had revealed their forms were like this.</p><p>One could imagine that the 22 Invisible Beings who had surrounded Xu Xiaoshou in an instant should have done the same.</p><p>Twenty-six Starlight Long Knives appeared and disappeared with the power to split mountains. When Xu Xiaoshou slashed at Dao Xuanji, they slashed at his head.</p><p>Rather than attacking directly, he attacked something else.</p><p>Everyone read Dao Xuanji’s intentions:</p><p>He had to take the risk of being hacked into pieces, seriously injured, or dying to take these 26 attacks head-on and kill Dao Xuanji at the same time.</p><p>Or should he turn around to block and let go of the person in his hands?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Mei Siren could not help but shout back.</p><p>The coldness of the 26 Power of Divinity could be seen from afar.</p><p>“Stop fighting…”</p><p>On the wall of the Southern Zone, Yu Zhiwen muttered silently, her heart clenched.</p><p>On one side was Xu Xiaoshou, and on the other side was the Supreme Master. No matter which side was defeated or injured, she could not bear it.</p><p>Of course, she could tell that Xu Xiaoshou was faced with a choice.</p><p>According to Xu Xiaoshou’s personality that she was familiar with, there was a high chance that this guy…</p><p>“Old granny, you’re too naive! Can this level force me to make a choice?”</p><p>Twenty-six flames surrounded Xu Xiaoshou tightly.</p><p>However, as the disdainful voice rang out, Xu Xiaoshou, who was in the crack, suddenly stopped his sword on Dao Xuanji’s head.</p><p>Faint golden light radiated from his body…</p><p>Acalanātha!</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>The Starlight Long Knife slashed down on the top of Xu Xiaoshou’s skull.</p><p>The surrounding sky collapsed under the explosion of the Power of Divinity.</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>The sky above the Jade Capital City seemed to have been torn apart, leaving only darkness.</p><p>26 Xuanji Star Officials’ combined attack!</p><p>Everyone watched helplessly as cracks began to appear on Xu Xiaoshou’s head. The cracks spread along the bridge of his nose, mouth, neck, and chest… Bit by bit, it crawled to the soles of his feet!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
