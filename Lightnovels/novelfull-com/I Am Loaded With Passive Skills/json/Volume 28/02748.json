Death apostles and abominators from all corners of the world were chatting excitedly.</p><p>“Oh my god! Have you heard? Hallmaster Dao has been demoted to a commoner, and there’s a reward for the time it takes for Three Incenses to burn!”</p><p>“Where did you hear such nonsense? Are you talking about Hallmaster Dao from the Ten High Nobles?”</p><p>“Yes, that’s right! Now his sister is in charge, known as Hallmaster Xuanji. Oh my god, I’ve already imagined a backstabbing plot. It’s so d*mn exciting!”</p><p>“Pfft, are you kidding? Hallmaster Dao would backstab someone?”</p><p>“I also heard that Lord Shou has gone to the Jade Capital City and signed a contract with the ghost beast. This is fresh news!”</p><p>“Hahaha, I think that’s possible, but don’t you think it’s too fast? The Jade Capital City is at the foot of Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, and there are so many demi-saints watching. Is Lord Shou just going there to die?”</p><p>“Bro, you don’t understand!”</p><p>“Oh, do you have any other insights?”</p><p>“Fury for the sake of beauty! As you all know, Lord Shou has a junior sister, the last of the Lei family… And the newly appointed Hallmaster Xuanji—some of you might not know her yet, but I’ve done my homework. She’s the one responsible for the destruction of the Lei family, who once held great renown with their Lei Family’s Eyes. Surely you’ve heard of them!”</p><p>“Oh? Are these two related?”</p><p>“Absolutely. Given Lord Shou’s personality, if Hallmaster Xuanji dares to attack the Jade Capital right after taking over, wouldn’t he need to explain to his junior sister? This debt must be settled!”</p><p>“This is also intelligence?”</p><p>“Uh, this is my reasonable speculation…”</p><p>“D*mn, get lost!”</p><p>The inn immediately erupted into chaos.</p><p>However, those involved were careful not to overstep. The old man spreading the reasonable speculation information was smiling and begging for mercy as he was beaten up. He was used to it.</p><p>By the window, a black-robed young man sat at a square table, leaning against the wall with a walking stick.</p><p>He wore a bamboo hat that covered half of his face. As he raised his head in the noisy inn hall, it became clear that his eyes were covered with a black cloth.</p><p>“Yo, bro, are you pretending to be Lei Shuangxing?”</p><p>A burly man with a jug of liquor swayed as he walked over, casting a lecherous gaze at the young man sitting upright with a perfect physique. A sleazy grin spread across his face.</p><p>“You have good taste. I’ve been walking down Riches Street for ten years. Everyone cosplays the Bazhun’an, but I’ve rarely seen anyone dressed as Lei Shuangxing.”</p><p>“Not to mention, your Divine-beating Crutch looks quite similar. Burp…”</p><p>A burp followed.</p><p>The drunkard took advantage of the situation and stumbled, nearly falling into the black-robed young man’s arms. His hand brushed the walking stick by the wall.</p><p>The commotion by the window quickly drew the attention of most in the inn. Everyone looked over.</p><p>“Lei Niao is here again!”</p><p>“Is he eyeing a new prey again and planning to snatch a civilian man?”</p><p>“That guy doesn’t look like someone to mess with. I have a feeling Lei Niao is going to fail!”</p><p>“So what if he fails? Within a seven-street radius, who doesn’t give a face to the Blackhawk Gang? Lei Niao is the deputy of the Blackhawk Gang…”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, Lei Niao collapsed into the black-robed young man’s arms.</p><p>The young man’s elbow pressed into Lei Niao’s chest, causing it to cave in. Several of his ribs broke, and he spewed out blood.</p><p>“D*mn it!”</p><p>Lei Niao came to his senses and tried to fight back.</p><p>The young man hooked his leg around Lei Niao’s knee, forcing him to kneel on the spot.</p><p>As Lei Niao’s head was about to crash onto the square table, he managed to halt himself with a forceful effort. Just as he was about to curse, the young man’s knee pushed the table up, sending a powerful surge of hot tea into Lei Niao’s face.</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>Lei Niao screamed, his face covered in blood and tea leaves, looking utterly miserable.</p><p>“Kid, you’re asking for death!”</p><p>He had barely raised his fists when the young man grabbed the chopstick holder from the table, flicked his fingers, and two wooden chopsticks pierced through Lei Niao’s throat.</p><p>“Uh, uh, uh…”</p><p>Lei Niao clutched his throat, his eyes bulging as blood gushed out from between his fingers.</p><p>“Dead?!”</p><p>This killing was too swift!</p><p>Although such events weren’t rare in the Southern Region, Lei Niao was a prominent figure locally.</p><p>His cultivation level close to Cutting Path was yet to be revealed. It was reasonable to expect him to have decent martial skills, but he died on the spot from chopsticks piercing his throat.</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>A dozen men jumped up from their tables, their eyes wide.</p><p>“Do you know who Lei…”</p><p>Bang, bang, bang!</p><p>After the chopsticks were used up, the black-robed young man lowered his sleeves, and the dozen burly figures fell, clutching their throats.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At that moment, Lei Niao’s weakened body finally hit the ground.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing slapped a Spirit Crystal on the now-damaged table.</p><p>“Drag him away and serve tea.”</p><p>The entire inn fell into a deathly silence!</p><p>The waiter was the first to react.</p><p>After a loud sigh, he quickly served the new tea and then hurriedly removed Lei Niao’s corpse from the premises.</p><p>Everyone in the inn was trembling with fear. They helped each other throw the remaining ten or so corpses onto the street.</p><p>“Lei Shuangxing?”</p><p>“D*mn, it’s the Saint Servant Lei Shuangxing, it’s real!”</p><p>“Holy shit, I’ve learned something today. So, it is the Divine-beating Crutch?”</p><p>“It must be a famed sword. Why else would he come to the Southern Region?”</p><p>“Then it’s the Seven Sword Deity. They might even go to the Southern Region’s Feng family and demand to know why Lord Shou is on the rankings and he isn’t.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
