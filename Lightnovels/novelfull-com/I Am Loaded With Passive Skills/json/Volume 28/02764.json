After a small dark sword lit up in his eyes, he used the Phantom Swords Technique to examine his soul.</p><p>The God Worship Willow Tree had indeed started to absorb his spiritual power!</p><p>“After it pierced through the human body, it can swallow flesh, blood, and soul to strengthen itself. Was this the ability of the God Worship Willow Tree?” Xu Xiaoshou asked in surprise.</p><p>Lei Xi’er was shocked.</p><p>The people behind him were also shocked.</p><p>They weren’t shocked by this conclusion. They were shocked that Xu Xiaoshou had risked his life to become a lab rat in order to get this conclusion.</p><p>“+(Doubted, Passive Points+)+ 6.”</p><p>The Ancestral Tree Dragon Apricot knew how terrifying Xu Xiaoshou’s body, the Master of the Apricot Realm was, so it was not worried at all. It sent a telepathic communication from afar.</p><p>“The Ancestral Tree God Worship Willow Tree was born after the flesh and soul of all living things were sacrificed. It can obtain supreme sacrificial power and enslave thousands of people that were sacrificed.”</p><p>“However, there is a process required for this. Its higher void level is currently too weak…”</p><p>“In its mature state, it can control a region in a breath and enslave the people in that region.”</p><p>“It is not only the Holy Emperor, but even the Ancestral God can be devoured. This is where the fame of the God Worship Willow Tree came from.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Would I become the servant of this willow tree after it drew my blood?</p><p>But why…</p><p>Why didn’t he feel anything?</p><p>As he looked aside, Xu Xiaoshou was amused.</p><p>The speed at which the God Worship Willow Tree devoured the energy was not even as fast as the recovery speed of the various passive skills in his body.</p><p>Did it overestimate its skill?</p><p>“Gulp, gulp…”</p><p>The willow branches squirmed and swallowed the energy in large mouthfuls. Dao Xuanji’s body became even stronger and her long robe was propped up.</p><p>“Release it!” Lei Xi’er shouted anxiously.</p><p>“Release?” The corners of Xu Xiaoshou’s lips curled up. “Why should I release my grip? You shouldn’t be saying these words to me…”</p><p>What did he mean?</p><p>Before anyone could react, Xu Xiaoshou raised his nine tails.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>He inhaled sharply.</p><p>The Breathing Technique, the Feast, and the Engulfing Power were activated at the same time.</p><p>The energy that was slowly absorbed by the God Worship Willow Tree suddenly rushed back like a runaway horse.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>Dao Xuanji, who by now was almost bursting at the seams, suddenly deflated like a balloon and almost turned into a dried up husk!</p><p>“God Worship Willow Tree?” Xu Xiaoshou grabbed the willow branch that pierced through his palm and suddenly laughed wildly like a madman.</p><p>“I should be the one to be worshipped!”</p><p>“You’re doing all this weird stuff to me? How can you possibly defeat me!”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>After the demon Xu Xiaoshou spoke, he pulled it out violently.</p><p>The branches of the God Worship Willow Tree were extremely tough. They didn’t break under the monster’s immense strength, but the husk that was Dao Xuanji couldn’t hold on any longer!</p><p>Her entire body was out of control, and she regained consciousness as she sailed through the air.</p><p>“Devour? I’ll let you devour it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s Engulfing Power surged to the limit.</p><p>“Uh, uh, uh…”</p><p>Dao Xuanji could not speak. Her body trembled violently, and in the end, her entire head was grabbed by Xu Xiaoshou along with the twisted branches.</p><p>“Come out!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face contorted in his anger and his eyes were bloodshot. He pressed her head with one hand and lashed out at Dao Xuanji’s chest. His right arm was wrapped around the branches of the God Worship Willow Tree and he exerted extreme force.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>With this pull and kick action, everyone understood…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was trying to pull out the roots of the God Worship Willow Tree from Dao Xuanji’s body!</p><p>Pulling out the God Worship Willow Tree!</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>This time, he could not pull out the long roots of the God Worship Willow Tree from Dao Xuanji’s body. Her body seemed to have merged with the roots of the God Worship Willow Tree.</p><p>But this was the terrifying part!</p><p>Under the tremendous force, Dao Xuanji’s entire body shrank inward. It deflated into a meatball before it bounced back into her original form.</p><p>Instantly, the cracking sound of shattered bones could be heard.</p><p>All the Saints, Lei Xi’er and Lei Shuangxing included, shuddered.</p><p>“Hiss! This fellow…”</p><p>Fang Wenxin’s palms were clammy with sweat and his back was chilled.</p><p>This pull almost caused his brain to shrink.</p><p>It was hard to imagine the excruciating pain that Dao Xuanji, who had borrowed the power of the God Worship Willow Tree, had to endure even if she could not extract the nutrients…</p><p>One could just imagine the agony she suffered!</p><p>It was fine if only her body was hurt.</p><p>From the looks of it, the degree of injury to her soul was no less than the pain her body suffered.</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s face was completely distorted.</p><p>Her expression collapsed in an instant.</p><p>After the first wave of pain subsided slightly, she heard a soft exclamation that came from behind her.</p><p>“Eh? So tough?”</p><p>“You’re tougher than a strip of air-dried beef jerky!”</p><p>Dao Xuanji felt uneasy.</p><p>At this moment, her heart and lungs twitched violently. For the first time in her life, she experienced actual fear.</p><p>He could not force Dao Xuanji to lower her head even if he was strong.</p><p>Death could not stop his desire for revenge.</p><p>However, a lunatic with a twisted mind who brought up something like ‘a strip of air dried beef jerky’ in the next breath after he pulled out the God Worship Willow Tree…</p><p>Who dared to get close to him?</p><p>He simply didn’t play by the rules at all!</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Dao Xuanji suddenly slashed out with her hand.</p><p>The withered hand that had been sucked dry suddenly turned into a saber that was as thin as a cicada’s wing.</p><p>“Sizzle.”</p><p>The shadow of the saber unintentionally cut off the branch of the God Worship Willow Tree and severed the connection with Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Everyone was dumbstruck.</p><p>So…</p><p>The truth was that when the God Worship Willow Tree appeared, Xu Xiaoshou was not shocked but instead he was happy and faced the difficulties head-on.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
