Beibei will be his best teacher, helping him overcome the deficiency that no one else can teach.”</p><p>“And after this…”</p><p>Bazhun’an paused, causing Elder Wuyue, Hallmaster Dao, the storyteller, Wei Feng, and even some who were attracted by the high-quality discussion in front of the Dao Imparting Mirror to glance over.</p><p>Bazhun’an chuckled and spread his hands lightly:</p><p>“With Hidden Bitter now so full of spiritual quality, I can’t imagine the scene of it undergoing Heavenly Unravel along with the Fourth Sword and the Flame Python… No!”</p><p>“Perhaps there’s no need to imagine; you all can recollect.”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Hallmaster Dao’s eyes narrowed, and his mind conjured an image of the white-robed swordsman surrounded by Immortal Sword Purple Sky Drunk, Demon Sword Nu Lan’s Voice, the vicious sword, Fourth Swords, Sword of Great Sorrow Tears No Sword, and Qingju, which was not yet the Injured Sword, all simultaneously undergoing Heavenly Unravel conjuring a terrifying scene.</p><p>His lower teeth quickly bared, his face contorting as he said sardonically, “Oh my, you all can…”</p><p>He stretched out his hand, “Imagine this!”</p><p>He fanned his hands in front of Bazhun’an as if blooming like a flower, “Imagine this!”</p><p>Then, he moved towards Elder Wuyue, “Just imagine!”</p><p>Next, to the storyteller, “Have you thought about it?”</p><p>And to Wei Feng…</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>“Oh, okay.”</p><p>…</p><p>The Golden Fate Dragon pierced through him, and Xu Xiaoshou felt the sword energy within his body breaking free uncontrollably, continuously forming and breaching his body.</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points +9999.”</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points +9999.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>I underestimated her!</p><p>I thought that with Hidden Bitter, capturing Beibei would be easy.</p><p>Little did I expect that after her Heavenly Unravel, she would be this difficult to deal with, and countless sword strokes flashed through Xu Xiaoshou’s mind…</p><p>Some were from Master Siren, some taught by Big Mouth Xiao playing Bazhun’an.</p><p>Without exception, they were sufficient for others, but to confront the Perfect Heavenly Unravel of Supreme Emperor Sword, they still fell short.</p><p>“Ahh—”</p><p>After the Golden Fate Dragon appeared, another came.</p><p>“Slay.”</p><p>Upon the Sovereign Stage, the Empress raised her left hand and another Golden Fate Dragon shot into the sky, accompanying the returning first dragon…</p><p>Dual Phoenix Dragon playing with beads!</p><p>And that bead is none other than the laughable Lord Shou!</p><p>“Chi Chi Chi…”</p><p>The Dao Imparting Mirror displayed a bloody scene, with a blood fog enveloping half the sky, ceaseless.</p><p>The sword energy bursting from within Lord Shou coalesced into the Heavenly Giant Sword.</p><p>Everyone realized.</p><p>Lord Shou can’t withstand the Dual Phoenix Dragon!</p><p>If he couldn’t handle that, once that greatsword materializes into reality, delivering the final strike after Supreme Emperor Sword’s Heavenly Unravel…</p><p>“Where to, Lord Shou?” Feng Zhongzui’s eyes dimmed as he stared intently at the mirror’s image, not wanting to see him lose, as he was actually rooting for Lord Shou.</p><p>“Ying—”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hadn’t moved, but Hidden Bitter couldn’t hold back any longer.</p><p>After numerous close encounters and brushes with the Golden Fate Dragon, its sword body had begun to show cracks, and its edge had curled.</p><p>Yet it seemed the scars could no longer suppress Hidden Bitter’s will!</p><p>When sensing its sword-bearer caught in a deadlock, Hidden Bitter let out a pained cry, transmitting a strong call:</p><p>“Merge!”</p><p>“Join with me!”</p><p>“Like her… unleash, Heavenly Unravel! We can do it too! Don’t be afraid!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who has been enduring the pain for so long, finally received Hidden Bitter’s first intense invitation to battle.</p><p>Is this the same sword that fears death?</p><p>He gently curved the corners of his mouth.</p><p>Heavenly Unravel?</p><p>Even if Hidden Bitter underwent Heavenly Unravel at this moment, could it stand against Emperor Sword Heavenly Unravel?</p><p>It’s possible to conduct a reverse Heavenly Unravel, dominated by the sword-bearer with Hidden Bitter assisting…</p><p>Yet can I, who am of today, solely by my prowess as an ancient swordsman, surpass one of the Five Great Divine Instruments of Chaos, the Supreme Emperor Sword itself?</p><p>“Humm!”</p><p>The Dual Phoenix Dragon made another probe.</p><p>Before Xu Xiaoshou could react, the Fourth Sword flew out on its own, cutting in front of the dark dragon head—it couldn’t stand by any longer.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Space churned, darkness turned into life, and both sides were equally matched.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Hidden Bitter’s sword body tensed up even more, as if it would snap under the humiliation.</p><p>“Merge with me!!!”</p><p>Humm!</p><p>Another Golden Fate Dragon leapt forth; before Hidden Bitter could move, the Flame Python followed, thrusting its sword into the dragon head and fiercely sending it flying.</p><p>Hidden Bitter’s pain almost tore it apart.</p><p>Such talent!</p><p>I’m so capable!</p><p>I must become stronger!</p><p>“Merge!!!”</p><p>But is Heavenly Unravel the only thing that can fight?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou actually held many cards in his hand, but compared to those, he had greater endurance.</p><p>He didn’t just want to make Hidden Bitter anxious.</p><p>He also wanted to make the Fourth Sword and the Flame Python anxious!</p><p>These two bosses, accustomed to looking down from high, were full of pride. On ordinary days they wouldn’t even reveal their spiritual quality, yet they could crush their enemies.</p><p>For a sword-bearer to wield their Heavenly Unravel, how easy could it be?</p><p>And now…</p><p>The Emperor Sword Heavenly Unravel, peerless in the whole world!</p><p>This was more than just a taunt at the Flame Python, which even looked down on the Devil Sword Myriad Weapons Devil Lord—it also defecated on the head of the Fourth Sword, another one of the Five Great Divine Instruments of Chaos!</p><p>Could they tolerate it?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know if they could tolerate it, but he could endure even more!</p><p>Hidden Bitter, not receiving a response from its owner, grew so anxious that it spun and leaped in midair, unable to mix into the arena.</p><p>Because the Dual Phoenix Dragon was divided by the Fourth Sword and the Flame Python, they each drew their battle lines, dignified and unbending.</p><p>But the Dual Phoenix Dragon was merely one of the imageries following the Emperor Sword Heavenly Unravel — how could it be everything?</p><p>In front of the Emperor’s Palace throne, the proud Empress flicked her finger, and that piercing sound rang out again:</p><p>“Emperor Sword·Seven Pillars of Slaughter!”</p><p>Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom…</p><p>As the sound fell, the Nine Heavens sent down seven phantoms of Emperor Swords, breaking through the palace ceiling, forming a sword formation that trapped Xu Xiaoshou and the Three Swords within it.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A command was uttered.</p><p>The Sword Formation Seven Pillars lit up with golden light, and inside the palace an Infinite Number shimmered, giving rise to countless majestic Emperor Swords.</p><p>At the hilt of each sword, eyes glared furiously, blazing with rage the moment they woke.</p><p>“Chi Chi Chi Chi Chi…”</p><p>Myriad swords crisscrossed within the Seven Pillars of Slaughter, moving back and forth, slashing through all laws.</p><p>This not only pierced through Xu Xiaoshou, but also sent the Three Swords flying, pummeled by countless sword energies into chaos.</p><p>Even, it freed the Dual Phoenix Dragon!</p><p>Every collision between sword and sword…</p><p>Every shattering between sword energy and Sword Will…</p><p>They each drew out strands and strands of emperor’s Sword Intent, converging back into the Heavenly Giant Sword.</p><p>Once the Sword Formation Seven Pillars took shape, this reconvergence accelerated at a rate of thousands, even tens of thousands of times.</p><p>That enormous Emperor Sword grew increasingly bright.</p><p>It became so heavy it seemed like it was going to fall from the sky, ready to blast through the entire Emperor Sword Heavenly Unravel Imagery—the Emperor’s Palace!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you’ve lost.”</p><p>Just as Xu Xiaoshou had previously gained the upper hand with a single stroke without taking her life, at the critical moment, Beibei’s voice floated out.</p><p>Unknown when, she had disappeared from the Emperor’s Palace, having climbed atop the Heavenly Emperor Sword, controlling the final decimating blow yet to fall.</p><p>“Submit, or die!”</p><p>Yet, unexpectedly, as this phrase appeared, Hidden Bitter, the Fourth Sword, and the Flame Python, all caught in the Sword Formation Seven Pillars and tossed about, quivered in unison.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou laughed.</p><p>He received three intense invitations.</p><p>“Merge!!!” Hidden Bitter went mad.</p><p>“Come, let’s give it a try.” The boss, Flame Python, spoke.</p><p>“Let me go crazy, let her go crazy, and let you go crazy…” the Fourth Sword, holding back until the end, declared, “Release me, then there will be no sword in the world!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
