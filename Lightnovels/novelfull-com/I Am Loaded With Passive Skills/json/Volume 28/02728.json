Thank you for your hard work. I’ll pass on the message to Lord Shou regarding the help received from the Flower Pavilion. After all, I’m also from the Flower Pavilion. We should help each other.”</p><p>“Alright, that’s it.”</p><p>The communication bead beeped and the call ended.</p><p>Li Fugui’s hands dropped to his side and his face blazed with excitement.</p><p>He clenched his fists and looked at the figure in the sky as his heart surged.</p><p>“The First Pavilion in the Sky…”</p><p>“It will be number 1 in Heaven and on earth!”</p><p>This was a sort of mysterious feeling.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was now certain that the contract Caramel had given him to contract Greedy the Cat Spirit was not something simple.</p><p>He used his Weaving Expertise to see through everything and memorized all the patterns and functions inside.</p><p>Then, he used the Weaving Technique to do some modifications, corrected the sketches and discarded many clauses and removed all kinds of sacrifices and costs.</p><p>The brand-new contract that was drawn up basically only had the connection between the contracting person and the ghost beast. There was no more concept of master and servant, only the consequences of breach of contract, and so on.</p><p>This way, he would be free from the possibility of being controlled by the Xu Yue Grey Palace.</p><p>At this moment, the contract turned into two rays of light; one entered the Purple Mansion and the other entered the soul of Greedy the Cat Spirit.</p><p>This kind of special bond that only existed in concept instantly flowed out in the form of physical feelings.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was instantly curious…</p><p>The abnormal ghost beast had forcefully possessed the body and resulted in a relationship like the one between Mo Mo and Feng Yujin.</p><p>The normal ghost beast who had a contract appeared to be in a similar situation as that of Mo and Feng.</p><p>He still didn’t know whether Xin Gugu was a pure ghost beast, or a ghost beast that possessed a human body. Or if the human and beast had become one and shared the same consciousness since they were young.</p><p>In any case, what was shown was that they had merged into one!</p><p>Then was there a possibility…</p><p>After a Ghost Beast Contract was formed between a human and a ghost beast, the spiritual connection would be strengthened, and the concept of ‘symbiosis’ would be weakened?</p><p>Or perhaps, if they were bolder, they could merge when they wanted to merge and separate when they wanted to separate. The flow and borrowing of power between the two was no different from a ghost beast host body?</p><p>In short:</p><p>There were only benefits and no disadvantages!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was never a person who conjured up beautiful illusions; he was a doer.</p><p>However, he was very lazy, and the second true body was the one who carried out all the actions.</p><p>When his second true body became bored in the Yuan Mansion, he did not only study the Divine Secret. After all, the Weaving Expertise was only one of his passive skills.</p><p>He had also studied the concept of a contract between a ghost beast and a human.</p><p>The new contract that Xu Xiaoshou had casually drawn up was one of the results of the second true body’s long-term efforts.</p><p>What he drew up…</p><p>This was exactly what Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts were!</p><p>However, there was indeed a gap between illusion and reality.</p><p>This was inevitable. After all, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t really draw up contracts with a few ghost beasts as an experiment.</p><p>The feeling during the first time was always wonderful…</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>When the power of contract flowed into the Origin Court of the Purple Mansion, Xu Xiaoshou entered into a mysterious space.</p><p>This was a brand new experience.</p><p>His consciousness seemed to have been pulled out of his body.</p><p>He saw with great clarity that everyone in Jade Capital City had become gloomy and unimportant.</p><p>At the center of the world, only Greedy the Cat Spirit and himself were left. They stood out in stark contrast.</p><p>The special connection from the contract turned into two visible streams of light. One hit his soul and the other hit Greedy the Cat Spirit.</p><p>It was as if a person had grown a third hand…</p><p>Or rather, it was similar to the second true body that had split for the first time…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could clearly feel his other ‘self’!</p><p>It underwent a whole myriad of emotions, cheer, rage, craving, madness, greed and confusion…</p><p>It was too contradictory!</p><p>This wasn’t him, it was Greedy the Cat Spirit!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had yet to fully experience the new feeling brought by his other self when he lost control instantly due to the chaos.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>In the sky above Jade Capital City, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes suddenly turned red. He was filled with bestial desires and with an eruption of golden light, he turned into the Berserk Giant.</p><p>At the same time, under the Thousand Ghost Soul Capture technique, the red color in Greedy the Cat Spirit’s eyes receded like the tide.</p><p>Its nine tails retracted, and it turned gentle. There were even some traces of confusion in its eyes.</p><p>“Meow?”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit looked hesitantly at the chaotic city and the humans who stared warily at it.</p><p>Wasn’t I refining my owner in the Apricot Realm?</p><p>It was not important!</p><p>Soon Greedy the Cat Spirit saw its owner, the guy with the golden light as he rushed toward it.</p><p>“Meow…”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit was filled with joy. It forgot about its current size, and out of habit, flew over.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Berserk Giant lashed out with its foot as it used its small body to fight the large body and directly sent the terrifying giant beast flying back.</p><p>“Woo…”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit moaned in its grievance. It didn’t know what it had done wrong that its owner wanted to punish him.</p><p>Before it could gather its thoughts, its eyes turned scarlet and its nine tails stood up.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>A violent beast roar made Xu Xiaoshou regain his senses.</p><p>When he looked up, he saw that Greedy the Cat Spirit’s claws were right in front of him. It was like a turn-based game, each player had to fight to regain the field.</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shouted.</p><p>At this moment, he understood that his calmness and Greedy the Cat Spirit’s violence had completed the first transformation after the fusion of spirit and soul.</p><p>Now, it had switched back.</p><p>This was a drawback in the contract that he had not considered before. After all, he did not have any experience so Xu Xiaoshou could only act according to the situation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
