I am Dao Qiongcang of the Holy Palace, I’d like to see who dares to… Ouch!”</p><p>…</p><p>Unlike the farce happening before the Dao Imparting Mirror in Half-Moon Bay, the atmosphere in Jade Capital City at this moment was incomparably grim.</p><p>Beibei clutched her neck, blood seeping through her fingers, her eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p>“I, lost?”</p><p>This had only just begun!</p><p>Not even a single sword had been crossed!</p><p>She hadn’t even used one thousandth of her moves.</p><p>In the widely anticipated first battle of the Sword Immortal, Beibei envisaged her own defeat, but that was only to happen after exerting all her strength, or perhaps due to a minor misstep in strategy?</p><p>It certainly wasn’t like this, with the battle ending just as it started.</p><p>Everyone was watching, ah!</p><p>The Burial Sword Tomb of the Eastern Region, the Feng family in the Southern Region… the entire community of ancient swordsmen across the world was watching!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s sword, being merely third-grade, didn’t even match the quality of the scabbard used by the Supreme Emperor Sword. How could it possibly defeat me in one stroke?</p><p>“It’s not…” Beibei froze, speechless as she stared at the black-clad figure before her.</p><p>“What do you mean ‘it’s not’?” Xu Xiaoshou sheathed his sword and stood still, calmly speaking:</p><p>“Admitting defeat can sometimes be harder than the defeat itself.”</p><p>“Acknowledging that you’ve been defeated by a single sword, and moreover, defeated by yourself, is even more difficult than admitting defeat.”</p><p>Beibei wore a look of acute embarrassment.</p><p>Her restless eyes glanced over Master Siren, elder Feng Tingchen, and caught glimpses of Elder Yang, Elder Gu, Li Fuyu…</p><p>Not one of them showed anything but a calm expression.</p><p>They did not scoff openly; their demeanors only conveyed a touch of pity and compassion.</p><p>This was even more unbearable than outright mockery!</p><p>This pity, like alms to the undeserving, made the proud Sword Immortal feel endlessly humiliated!</p><p>“I haven’t lost—”</p><p>Beibei, reversing her grip on the Emperor Sword, suddenly leaped into the air, hovering high as she looked down at the myriad ancient swordsmen below and cried out in horror: “Xu Xiaoshou, I have not yet lost! Not at all!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked up only to see a boiling soul.</p><p>Gazing at the Sword Immortal Bei, crowned with an invisible diadem, as majestic as an Empress, he seemed to see yet another proud and vibrant flower.</p><p>They grew in the greenhouse of the Holy Emperor Rao clan, the Bei family, indulging in the finest resources, defeating all enemies in the world, yet never truly facing themselves.</p><p>Whether it was the narrow-minded emotion sword technique or the Supreme Emperor Sword augmented with the Ten Thousand Sword Technique…</p><p>All were high above the clouds.</p><p>Yet all were just castles in the air.</p><p>With a single word, Xu Xiaoshou stripped away Beibei’s veil of modesty: “You’ve simply never lost before, not that you’ll never lose.”</p><p>“You’re full of shit! Shut your mouth, Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Beibei was furious, her eyes flashing crimson, “If I had lost, wouldn’t I be able to accept it? It’s merely the Fantasy Sword Technique, and I know it too!”</p><p>She held the Emperor Sword horizontally before her neck.</p><p>With a sudden slash, dazzling sword light shattered the heavens and vanished into nothingness.</p><p>“Dao Penetration!”</p><p>This sword traversed space and even time.</p><p>Not only did it incorporate the Dao Penetration from the 3000 Sword Styles, which could ignore all defenses, but it was also deeply versed in the true will of the Fantasy Sword Technique and approached the bounded domain of “Space-Time Transition.”</p><p>“Fantasy Sword Technique, first level, the Sword Immortal Bei knows it too!”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui’s voice rang out just in time, focusing the camera back on Lord Shou, “Does this count as a covert attack? Can Lord Shou react in time?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even budge. His figure simply shifted within the frame of the mirror.</p><p>“Whoosh…”</p><p>The north wind brings snow, and the Red Plum Blossoms gracefully twirl.</p><p>The sword light passed right through him, and Xu Xiaoshou’s form turned into nothingness.</p><p>Feng Zhongzui knew swordsmanship too well.</p><p>He instantly dedicated half of the screen to a smiling Mei Siren, excitedly exclaiming:</p><p>“Three Streams of Red Plum Blossoms, Falling Flower World!”</p><p>“This is Master Siren’s swordsmanship, Falling Flower World employs the Heart Sword Technique, the Swordless Sword Technique… a combination of several major Sword Flows. This is swordsmanship on a higher level than Sword Immortal Bei!”</p><p>Then the Dao Imparting Mirror was focused back on the Arena.</p><p>As expected, accompanied by the drift of falling blossoms, Lord Shou and Sword Immortal Bei became illusory; their real forms no longer visible in the Arena.</p><p>“Watch me!”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui planted his feet firmly, his eyes taking on a different look.</p><p>Grasping the Dao Imparting Mirror and infusing it with Sword Will, he activated its advanced features, wielding it like a sword and slashing across.</p><p>“No Sword Arts, Swordless Sword Form!”</p><p>Reality and illusion switched instantly, and the screen of the Dao Imparting Mirror was swapped for a blurred state of consciousness.</p><p>In that view, the heavens and earth were ethereal, and spiritual energy burst with all the colors of the spectrum.</p><p>All other present became translucent as if their mere existence was being erased.</p><p>However, in the midst of battle, a radiant Golden Fate Dragon and a towering black edifice appeared.</p><p>At the summit, stood a figure holding a black sword at an angle, with a cold gaze upon the scene.</p><p>…</p><p>“This isn’t good!”</p><p>Mei Siren burst forth in a dash.</p><p>He immediately recognized that Xu Xiaoshou was casting Falling Flower World to draw Bei Bei into a battle of consciousness. Simultaneously, he invoked his Heart Sword Technique from the start.</p><p>His Heart Sword Technique was a critical hit for any ancient swordsman!</p><p>How could Feng Zhongzui possibly withstand it?</p><p>However, just as he was about to enter Falling Flower World, immersed in illusion, Mei Siren saw a joyful haze of alcohol, effortlessly commentating:</p><p>“Heart Sword Technique, Present Gods and Buddhas!”</p><p>“Lord Shou has initiated the attack… No, he pre-empted it; his Heart Sword Technique isn’t about Present Gods and Buddhas, but rather related to devilish energy?”</p><p>Mei Siren was stunned.</p><p>This kid…</p><p>Even if Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t targeting him, the ripples of his Heart Sword Technique could affect any ancient swordsman, especially since Feng Zhongzui volunteered to step into Falling Flower World.</p><p>Yet he remained utterly unfazed by the aftermath!</p><p>His mental fortitude was extraordinarily strong!</p><p>…</p><p>“Heart Sword Technique, Demons Under Eyes!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
