It was solely Xu Xiaoshou, standing on the Life Power Upanishad Formation, who managed to feed it!</p><p>“You’re awake?”</p><p>When the little junior sister in his arms sat up, a smile appeared on Xu Xiaoshou’s lips.</p><p>This was one of the reasons he chose the first Reckless Life Dao Disc.</p><p>Not only would it effectively resolve his Ultimate Giant’s endurance issues, but it would also allow his junior sister to recover quickly.</p><p>The Saint Emperor’s attack was indeed devastating.</p><p>But with the Ultimate Life Demon Physique, as long as life force was sufficiently provided, even the gravest injuries could heal quickly.</p><p>Moreover, the little junior sister had also consumed many Life Elixirs from Greedy the Cat Spirit in the Apricot Realm, providing a solid foundation for further recovery.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Mu Zixi stared blankly at the handsome man in front of her as if she had lost her memory.</p><p>Her mind was in a whirl.</p><p>This person looked like Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou’s ears did not have so many small hairs, nor were they pointed. His hair was not white, and there was no red diagram tattoo on his forehead.</p><p>Most importantly…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t have a tail!</p><p>The guy holding her in his arms had nine white fluffy tails behind him. After Mu Zixi woke up, she gathered her disheveled hair into two bunches and casually grabbed a handful.</p><p>That was so soft!</p><p>“Liked, Passive Points, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>“Meow!” The nine-tailed quivered, and Xu Xiaoshou shuddered, letting out a surprised sound.</p><p>Her eyes lit up. A catman!</p><p>“Favored, Passive Points, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>Smack!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gave his junior sister a light knock on the head and said with a touch of annoyance, “Mind your image!”</p><p>“Ouch.” Mu Zixi cried out in pain, but her shock turned into delight.</p><p>This familiar gesture, tone, and intimacy immediately made her recognize her senior brother Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>But…</p><p>She thought, “Mind my image? Why?’</p><p>As she scanned the scene with her spiritual senses, the little girl immediately felt a shiver.</p><p>The city was packed with people trapped inside Jade Capital City.</p><p>Numerous demi-saints floated above the city. Some were unfamiliar, including Master Siren and the Master Dean…</p><p>“Was that the Master Dean’s twin demi-saint brother?”</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“Aren’t we in the Central Yuan world, fighting Holy Emperor Qilin and Holy Emperor Bei Huai?” Several questions came into her mind.</p><p>Mu Zixi still remembered the Holy Emperor’s power. In Lei Xi’er’s state, she had only taken one hit and fainted on the spot.</p><p>Now, waking up, Xu Xiaoshou had already returned to Jade Capital City.</p><p>There were so many demi-saints. Apart from the ones she recognized, were they all from the Holy Divine Palace?</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Her thoughts were suddenly jolted.</p><p>Mu Zixi’s gaze froze.</p><p>The images her spiritual senses had scanned faded from her mind.</p><p>As she looked back, the female figure in front of her filled her with a surge of inexplicable anger!</p><p>This person was enveloped in devilish energy. There was a bloody hole between her eyebrows, and her face was extremely blurred.</p><p>Yet, the faint trace of meanness and ruthlessness between her delicate brows and lips…</p><p>Mu Zixi trembled, her body shaking as if struck by lightning, after just a single glance.</p><p>“Who is she?”</p><p>“I’ve never seen her before. But why, why…”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s thoughts erupted like a volcano, and her entire body began to tremble violently.</p><p>When she lifted her hand, she noticed her fingers twitching with excitement, and her knuckles were stiff.</p><p>These were all subconscious reactions!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what… what’s happening to me?”</p><p>She was in a panic.</p><p>How could this be?</p><p>What kind of spiritual technique is this?</p><p>She hadn’t done anything to herself, but her body was completely out of control!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>At that moment, the thoughts boiling like a volcano in her mind burst out after internal collapse, spewing countless fragmented and frozen images.</p><p>Mu Zixi’s pupils suddenly lost focus.</p><p>What was she seeing…</p><p>Broken corpses and shattered blades.</p><p>Resolute backs and ferocious roars.</p><p>A headless corpse lying in a pool of blood under the person wielding the saber.</p><p>Neatly arranged square jade boxes on the ground, with familiar and unfamiliar heads beside them.</p><p>“Why…”</p><p>Why did these heads have no eyes?</p><p>Suddenly, the jade boxes began to open one by one!</p><p>Inside were pairs of bloody eyes, unwilling to close, yet full of vitality.</p><p>“The Eye of Heaven, Three Loathsome Eyes, Soul-Fixing Eye, Flower Fairy Eye, Cross-shaped Eye, Red Sorrowful Spiritual Pearl, Three Tribulation Eye, Dong Ruo Eye, Pearl Gem Star Eyes, Eye of the Unknown…”</p><p>The scene was too horrifying!</p><p>Dozens of pairs of eyes appeared suddenly in her mind, opening simultaneously from the depths of her sealed memories!</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Mu Zixi clutched her head and screamed.</p><p>Her pupils spun rapidly, one black and one white, emanating God Devil Mist…</p><p>“God Devil Eyes!”</p><p>“It is you!”</p><p>Dao Xuanji, seeing those eyes amidst the devilish energy, let out a mad roar. Desperate to drag someone down with her, she lunged forward forcefully. “Die!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stepped forward with a stoic expression.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He dug his nails into Dao Xuanji’s arm.</p><p>With his other hand, he pushed upward, using the combined power of the Heavenly Ancestor and Dragon Ancestor, along with the monstrous strength of the ghost beast, shattering the sword on the spot.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
