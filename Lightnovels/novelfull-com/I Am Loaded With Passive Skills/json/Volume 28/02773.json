This is a competition meant to be watched.”</p><p>“Challenging each other is just the beginning. After that, I need to ask the Southern Region’s Feng family to send someone over to supervise the battle and wait for the spectators to enter the Arena.”</p><p>“Once the Feng family sends people, we also need to set up a ‘Dao Imparting Mirror,’ which will broadcast the images of the battle between the Sword Deity to all the major royal cities in the five domains of the continent. Additionally, the Feng family will keep a recording as a memento for future generations.”</p><p>“This battle will capture the attention of everyone!”</p><p>Beibei finished counting on her fingers, pressed down on her sword, and looked over seriously once more.</p><p>“In the end, three days is a short time, considering our battlefield is in the Central Region and not the Southern Region.”</p><p>“Most of the ancient swordsmen had already moved to the Southern Region when the new Seven Sword Deity rankings were released, waiting for the challenge and to observe the fight.”</p><p>Seemingly remembering something, Beibei appeared excited and said, “If you want to fight in the Southern Region, that’s even better! I’ll fight you anytime!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought, “Why would I go to the Southern Region? If I went there, wouldn’t it mean letting that old lady off the hook?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned as he listened, turning his head to look at Lei Shuangxing. He completely forgot that this guy was blind. He only focused on raising his eyebrows and giving him a significant look.</p><p>Fighting in front of the whole world interested him greatly.</p><p>Even though there was a chance he might not gain any Passive Points through the Dao Imparting Mirror, there were plenty of people in Jade Capital City, so it didn’t matter.</p><p>Mainly, it was all about “fame”!</p><p>Nurturing of Fame, the Sword Deity.</p><p>Nurturing of Fame, the famed swords.</p><p>When it comes to “fame,” Bazhun’an started this trend, and Xu Xiaoshou wanted to get a piece of the action.</p><p>But he didn’t expect the challenge between the Seven Sword Deity to involve such a complicated process.</p><p>After hearing all of this, whatever respect he had gained for the ancient swordsmen vanished completely.</p><p>What nonsense about “better to break than bend”—they’re just a bunch of stubborn mules stuck in their old ways!</p><p>And Lei Shuangxing, being the head of the stubborn mules, naturally didn’t side with his people. Instead, he nodded and said, “I just came from the Southern Region.”</p><p>This guy…</p><p>He was already in the Southern Region and was planning to challenge each person on the Seven Sword Deity rankings one by one. Did he also want a piece of the action?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly became vigilant. Would he challenge me next?</p><p>He hadn’t even figured out what level Lei Shuangxing was at yet. He always seemed cold, dismissive, and full of himself. Xu Xiaoshou had never seen him fight with his full strength.</p><p>“Do we have to go through this whole process?” Xu Xiaoshou turned to Master Siren and asked for confirmation again.</p><p>“If you want to fight, you have to follow the process.” Mei Siren smiled gently, his face kind and benevolent, as he flipped the fan in his hand.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at the bold words, “You dare”, and fell into deep thought…</p><p>Stubborn old mule!</p><p>Lei Xi’er watched, amused.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hadn’t changed. He had just suddenly awakened his conscience and reflected on himself. He had become more serious from his usual flippant self. Everyone had moments of emotional outbursts.</p><p>“Three days is too long!”</p><p>Soon, Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand impatiently and said, “Three days is enough for me to massacre a city thirty times over. Don’t think about stalling for time.”</p><p>The people in the Jade Capital City were terrified out of their wits.</p><p>Beibei’s face also darkened. “The ancient rules are the ancient rules. Since you want to enjoy the privileges brought by the title of Seven Sword Deity, you must fulfill the corresponding obligations. Etiquette must not be abandoned!”</p><p>“What obligations? I haven’t even begun to enjoy any privileges yet. All I’ve gotten is a lot of trouble, and now you’re talking about obligations? Ridiculous!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou swung his sword, looking towards the other two ancient swordsmen outside Jade Capital City, and called out, “You there, and you! Do you also want to challenge me?”</p><p>“You’re all ancient swordsmen. Stop pretending. You look like you want a fight.”</p><p>“My time is valuable. I’ll give each of you the time it takes for one incense stick to burn, consider that the greatest respect I can offer.”</p><p>“After three incense sticks, I want to end this fight and storm the Sacred Mountain. I don’t have time to waste here with you!”</p><p>The people in the city followed Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze, looking back to see two figures flying into the air outside the city.</p><p>“Elder Gu?”</p><p>“The number one Sword Deity, Elder Gu Yu, is he going to challenge Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“Who’s that girl? I’ve never seen her before…”</p><p>“Li Fuyu! She’s Li Fuyu of the sword tower, ranked fourth among the Seven Sword Deity, right below Xiao Kongtong!”</p><p>“Wow, this is going to be interesting…”</p><p>The crowd felt excited about the upcoming battle, but Gu Yu’s face didn’t look pleased. He was also a premium breed of stubborn mule. “Etiquette is etiquette. After Beibei’s battle, once you’ve recovered, I will challenge you.”</p><p>“Oh? A series of duels?” Xu Xiaoshou was amused. “No need for all that trouble. My endurance is invincible. You can all gang up on me, or better yet…”</p><p>“I will take on all three of you by myself!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
