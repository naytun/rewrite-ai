D*mn! This is amazing, I want to see it! By the way, does he have the Lei Family’s Eyes…?”</p><p>“Shh! I heard that those eyes were taken out when he was young. Didn’t you see the black cloth covering them? The only reason we survived was because of the Bazhun’an!”</p><p>“D*mn! D*mn! Good buddy, let’s move the bodies first. Let’s get out and talk. Let’s get out and talk!”</p><p>After a brief period of stunned silence, the inn erupted again, with people pointing towards the person by the window.</p><p>As long as they didn’t provoke him, they wouldn’t die. The Saint Servant was very principled, and Lei Shuangxing didn’t look like a bloodthirsty person.</p><p>“Slap.” The waiter finished serving tea and moving the bodies.</p><p>He turned and saw a black command token on Lei Shuangxing’s table.</p><p>There was a moment of silence in the inn, then it exploded again. Two or three burly men were so excited they embraced each other.</p><p>“D*mn! Saint Servant Token!”</p><p>“Holy shit, I’ve learned something new. After being a death apostle for so many years, I’ve finally seen a genuine Saint Servant Token!”</p><p>“I came from the City of the Dead Bodhisattva, and I’ve never seen a Saint Servant Token.”</p><p>“Wow, and you’re bragging? I’m from the Fringe Moon Immortal City!”</p><p>“Then I’m from the Holy Divine Palace. No, I’m Hallmaster Xuanji himself!”</p><p>The waiter could no longer hear the discussions behind him. In fear, he knelt and prostrated himself at the table, “Sir, is there… anything… you need?”</p><p>Lei Shuangxing picked up his teacup and said calmly, “This is the Flower Pavilion’s stronghold, right? Have your manager come out for a moment. I need detailed information on Xu Xiaoshou from Jade Capital City.”</p><p>“Hey, hey, hey!”</p><p>The waiter nodded and turned around, shouting, “Boss!”</p><p>Under the astonished gazes of the crowd, the person who had spread the “reasonable speculation” pushed his way out of the crowd. “I’m the manager.”</p><p>“D*mn!”</p><p>In an instant, the entire inn was filled with vulgar exclamations.</p><p>“Speak.” Lei Shuangxing didn’t even glance back as he placed another Spirit Crystal on the table.</p><p>“Senior Lei, I’ve already provided all the first-hand information I have. It’s all accurate and verified…”</p><p>“Right, the only thing we’re unsure about is that Lord Shou allegedly killed Hallmaster Xuanji in public. We’re still confirming this.”</p><p>“Lei Xi’er.” Lei Shuangxing said softly.</p><p>A low murmur spread through the inn.</p><p>“That’s right, they’re all from the Lei family. Lei Shuangxing is also a remnant of the Lei family!”</p><p>“D*mn, now that you mention it… Lei Shuangxing, Lei Xi’er, are they biological siblings?”</p><p>“Most likely…”</p><p>The manager was stunned for a moment before quickly clarifying, “That’s just my speculation.”</p><p>“No!” A voice suddenly called out from outside Riches Inn.</p><p>Thump thump thump…</p><p>The chopsticks, spiritual swords, and even the Divine-beating Crutch leaning against the wall began to buzz.</p><p>“Sword Will!”</p><p>Everyone turned around in shock.</p><p>Outside the inn, a middle-aged man stepped over corpses as he approached.</p><p>He had bright eyes, white teeth, red lips, and a clean gaze. His white shirt, open at the chest, added a wild, untamed aura to his otherwise righteous presence.</p><p>“Who is this?”</p><p>“Another ancient swordsman? But I’ve never seen this person before!”</p><p>“Sword Will, what level of Sword Will is this? It seems a bit… weak. Innate Sword Intent?”</p><p>As the white-robed middle-aged man entered the inn, those who had been trying to get a better look finally saw his face.</p><p>Suddenly, someone let out a startled shout, “D*mn! Hallmaster Dao?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao, Dao Qiongcang?”</p><p>This left everyone in shock.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang, the Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace who sat atop Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, hadn’t shown himself in public for decades!</p><p>People’s impressions of his appearance…</p><p>Only existed in the portraits of people being stabbed by flying knives!</p><p>And on the Spirit Crystal cards issued by the Plenty Gold Company, where his likeness was depicted in simplified, engraved sketches for verification purposes!</p><p>“You’re Dao Qiongcang?”</p><p>“D*mn impostor, can Hallmaster Dao be here in the Southern Region? Haha, I’m dying of laughter!”</p><p>“Pfft, I can’t hold it in anymore. Dao Qiongcang with Innate Sword Intent? You guys must be kidding. Hahaha… Cough!”</p><p>“Everyone, calm down and think about it. Hallmaster Dao seems to be on the wanted list. It makes sense for him to come to the Southern Region to seek refuge…”</p><p>“Hahaha, Dao Qiongcang seeking refuge? Bro, what kind of joke are you making with the Bazhun’an? Hahaha!”</p><p>“D*mn! This is too much! Your intelligence is timely. You’ve already started acting… I’m impressed! I’m convinced. Amazing!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang, dressed in white, walked into the inn amidst the laughter and mockery.</p><p>His unusual aura made the discussions gradually quiet down.</p><p>Suddenly, he spread his arms wide. After enjoying the vibrations of the spiritual swords in the inn, he forcefully brought his hands down.</p><p>“Silence.”</p><p>Swish…</p><p>The chopsticks stopped shaking.</p><p>The spiritual swords ceased their trembling.</p><p>The entire Riches Inn fell into a deathly silence.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked around arrogantly, he smiled faintly.</p><p>“Do I have the demeanor of a Sword Deity?”</p><p>Everyone in the Riches Inn was stunned for a moment. In the blink of an eye, everyone on the ground burst into laughter, slapping their thighs and wiping their tears.</p><p>“D*mn!”</p><p>“Amazing, too amazing!”</p><p>“Bro, your performance is so realistic… I heard that Hallmaster Dao is known as the Elder Dao the Flamboyant. You’re embodying that flair!”</p><p>“Yes! This move isn’t just about the Seven Sword Deities. It’s about being the number one Sword Deity. Hua Lai and Bei Tian might choose not to welcome Lord Shou, but he would welcome an Elder Dao the Flamboyant like you!”</p><p>“Hahaha, bro, you are too interesting…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang with Innate Sword Intent was not the only interesting thing.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
