What do you mean you can finish me in a few moves? Be careful of your words.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed. “You and I are both fighting to protect Jade Capital City. If you win, you will gain fame, and profit, and be conferred a title. If I win, I can only turn around and leave. I won’t get anything. This is too unfair.”</p><p>“Senior Feng, don’t you agree?” With that, he looked at Feng Tingchen.</p><p>Feng Tingchen lowered his head and thought to himself, “Don’t drag me into this. You guys decide for yourselves. Just let me know when you’re done. Feng Zhongzui will record the battle, and the Sword Pagoda will provide the results.”</p><p>Beibei was nervous. She raised the Supreme Emperor Sword. “Xu Xiaoshou, the war is over. What are you trying to do?”</p><p>“The emperor will take turns. Next year, it’s my turn!” Xu Xiaoshou laughed and pointed at Jade Capital City beneath his feet.</p><p>“You have won. What should be yours is yours. I will no longer pursue the faults of your Hallmaster Xuanji and will leave.”</p><p>“But if I win, this Jade Capital City will belong to me!”</p><p>Jade Capital City fell into a dead silence.</p><p>Everyone in front of the Dao Imparting Mirror was puzzled, not understanding what he meant.</p><p>“What he means is that he will be in charge of the Jade Capital City’s great array?” Qiao Qianzhi understood it this way.</p><p>“Does the First Pavilion in the Sky want to establish a foothold in Jade Capital City, or open a branch there like the Magic Pill Technicians Association, and gain the recognition of the Holy Divine Palace?” Shi Ti wondered aloud.</p><p>“Does he also want to settle down?” Xin Gugu was stopped by the Dao Imparting Mirror on the way to the Central Region to ask for the Saint Beast.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Beibei frowned and looked down from the city wall.</p><p>“I mean it literally!” Xu Xiaoshou spread out his hands. “If I win, the land of Jade Capital City will belong to me, the great array will belong to me, the wealth will belong to me, and the people will belong to me… Everything will belong to The First Pavilion in the Sky, not to Jade Capital City or the Holy Divine Palace.”</p><p>“You’re dreaming!” Beibei’s eyes turned red. This Xu Xiaoshou has such big ambitions.</p><p>“Anyway, Hallmaster Xuanji didn’t protect you. She even wanted to swallow you with the God Worship Willow Tree. Demi-Saint Ye protected you a few times, and I protected you a few times…” Xu Xiaoshou looked down and said.</p><p>Jade Capital City was suddenly filled with whispers.</p><p>What Xu Xiaoshou said was not without reason.</p><p>Compared to Demi-Saint Ye, Hallmaster Xuanji was almost an enemy of Jade Capital City!</p><p>It was fine if the great array couldn’t protect everyone, but it had gone out of control previously. It was indeed trying to suck living people to provide vitality for her survival.</p><p>“I agree.”</p><p>“I disagree!”</p><p>“I think Lord Shou is stronger than Hallmaster Xuanji.”</p><p>“You’re a traitor! You’re protected by the Holy Divine Palace and benefit from the spiritual source gathered by the capital’s great array. How can you side with outsiders?”</p><p>“But Lord Shou makes a good point. The emperor will take turns. Next year, I’ll follow whoever can make my life better!”</p><p>“How dare you!”</p><p>“Bullshit!”</p><p>…</p><p>There were complaints everywhere in the city.</p><p>Not only were the people in front of the Dao Imparting Mirror shocked, but even Beibei was shocked.</p><p>She had never thought that anyone in Jade Capital City would be moved by Xu Xiaoshou’s suggestion. Just as she was about to reject him again, a soft voice sounded in her ear.</p><p>Feng Zhongzui, who was watching the battle excitedly, suddenly had a thought. “There’s a situation!”</p><p>He zoomed in on Northern Sword Deity’s expression, focusing on her slightly moving ears. He explained to the Dao Imparting Mirror, “You might not be able to see it clearly, but I’m here. I can accurately tell you that someone just sent a telepathic communication!”</p><p>Feng Tingchen’s entire body went numb. He turned around, about to get angry, when he saw Feng Zhongzui pointing his sperm at him.</p><p>He immediately became gentle and refined, his chest puffed up a little, and his expression became profound.</p><p>He even turned his body slightly, revealing half of the Crane Sword, half real and half hazy, making it look even more Godhood-like and alluring.</p><p>This was a public meeting, and the image was the most important!</p><p>Seeing this, Feng Zhongzui snorted silently. He was not afraid of anything.</p><p>As the most qualified spectator, what they focused on while gossiping in the past, they now make public.</p><p>He thought, “I’m Feng Tingchen, and I’m the least obedient!”</p><p>“I agree,” Beibei said with difficulty.</p><p>“Wow!” Feng Zhongzui immediately cried out in shock. He covered his mouth and whispered, “That must be Hallmaster Xuanji’s order. Otherwise, no one could change the will of an ancient swordsman so quickly. You should know that, other than me, all ancient swordsmen are stubborn, including our old family head, Feng Tingchen…”</p><p>“Feng Zhongzui!” Feng Tingchen couldn’t take it anymore. “If you want to die, don’t drag the Feng family down with you!”</p><p>Old family head, times had changed… The young man pointed the Dao Imparting Mirror at Lord Shou and said with a smile, “I bet Lord Shou will win. I bet the student will surpass the master. What about you guys?”</p><p>Feng Tingchen choked and could no longer speak.</p><p>“How refreshing!” In the Arena, Xu Xiaoshou laughed loudly and raised the Fourth Sword high.</p><p>“In that case, I have no other questions…”</p><p>“I’ll give you this chance to defeat me in front of the world!”</p><p>Beibei also raised the Supreme Emperor Sword. Her face was ashen, and she did not say anything else.</p><p>Feng Tingchen was truly afraid that Feng Zhongzui from the family would spout nonsense again. He immediately said, “In that case, the first battle of the Seven Sword Deity rankings will be transmitted through sword contact to show the world… Please fight!”</p><p>“Seven Sword Deity Beibei, Sword Name Supreme, please fight!” Beibei cupped her fists and threw her sword into the air.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment. He turned to Master Siren. “During the battle, can only one sword be used?”</p><p>“Usually, because most people only have one sword, but there’s no restriction,” Mei Siren responded via telepathic communication.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou then breathed a sigh of relief and looked at the Fourth Sword in his hand.</p><p>As one of the Five Great Divine Instruments of Chaos, this sword could naturally defeat the Supreme Emperor Sword, but having the Fourth Sword was already quite famous…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou put away the Flame Sword, Flame Python, and the vicious sword, Fourth Swords. Instead, he shot a black snake into the sky, wriggling wildly and excitedly.</p><p>“Sob…”</p><p>When the black snake and the Supreme Emperor Sword touched, they began to rub against each other in a greasy manner. Then, both of them emitted shocking sword cries that were either resistant or comfortable.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face twitched, but he did not look sideways. He cupped his fists and pretended to be calm.</p><p>“Seven Sword Deity Xu Xiaoshou, the sword name is Hidden Bitter…”</p><p>“Please fight!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
