It was slight and there was also a progress bar.</p><p>At the same time, Xu Xiaoshou’s spirit was lifted, and he entered another state that he had never entered before. He began to comprehend this seemingly new world.</p><p>“Life…”</p><p>His body emitted a faint aura of path energy, as if he had entered a state of epiphany that he had not entered for a long time.</p><p>The Field of Profound Dao and the Profound Dao Seed could be controlled to gain insight!</p><p>However, a one percent improvement was really insignificant. It did not provide any substantial help to comprehend the Great Path of Life.</p><p>But now, Xu Xiaoshou was not the same as before. He had a lot of Passive Points in his inventory and could spend them freely.</p><p>“Then bring it on!”</p><p>The Passive Points were spent in quantities of 100,000.</p><p>The Profound Dao Seed was exchanged one at a time.</p><p>The Life Dao Disc under his feet underwent a special state of Enlightenment. It gradually lit up in a way that made it visible to the naked eye.</p><p>“Life Dao Disc (14%).”</p><p>“Life Dao Disc (15%).”</p><p>“Life Dao Disc (20%).”</p><p>When he broke through the number twenty mark, Xu Xiaoshou clearly felt that some shackles had been removed.</p><p>He realized that this was probably the limit that the ordinary Spiritual Cultivator could achieve in their entire lives.</p><p>If they wanted to gain further insight, they would need to advance further and deepen their understanding of the attributes. Each step would be extremely difficult.</p><p>The Profound Dao Seed did not have this drawback.</p><p>There was controlled insight that allowed one to break through in their comprehension of the Great Path. It was as simple and smooth as eating and drinking.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t stop and continued to open the Profound Dao Seed.</p><p>“Life Dao Disc (21%).”</p><p>“Life Dao Disc (21%).”</p><p>“Life Dao Disc (30%).”</p><p>When the progress reached the number 30 mark, the feeling that he would break through the bottleneck reappeared.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt refreshed.</p><p>All the living things in the world, flowers, plants, and trees included, cheered and waved at him, even those that had their roots uprooted.</p><p>His body had become the center of a vortex that subconsciously absorbed all life force.</p><p>The circulation of the Fundamental Passive Skill in his body also appeared as a visual presentation.</p><p>Eternal Vitality. It turned out that his own blood and Qi had split rapidly. It was the ‘micro life’ in his body that self-reproduced and pushed his ‘Da Sheng’ form, to flourish.</p><p>High Spirits referred to the energy reserve. This meant that all the spiritual sources and energy reserve in the body split and reproduced on their own. It replenished whatever he had consumed and resisted the bad state of ‘not able to make ends meet’.</p><p>“The spiritual source is also a kind of tiny life?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was deep in thought, but he quickly understood.</p><p>Not only the spiritual source, but the Heaven and Earth spiritual energy could also be regarded as a kind of tiny life.</p><p>Their movements were irregular. When they were absorbed by the plants, they turned into the essence of the plants, and when they were absorbed by the human body, they became the essence of the human body…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized that the appearance of his Life Dao Disc was related to his Eternal Vitality and High Spirits, as well as his gradually growing Spiritual Cultivation realm and life form.</p><p>The Great Dao Disc would not appear for no reason. It was meant to deepen and strengthen one’s ability.</p><p>And wasn’t the essence of the human body a basic life form that could grow?</p><p>Then…</p><p>Other than me?</p><p>As he maintained this controlled state of epiphany, Xu Xiaoshou continued to cultivate the Profound Dao Seed. He could also clearly observe all the human-shaped life forms around him through his Perception.</p><p>If one were to understand them from the perspective of the Weaving Technique, they could easily be read as life diagrams in one’s field of vision. The light inside shone brightly, and each had its own merits.</p><p>Let’s take Zhong Yuanzi. If we set aside his crazy research concept and his Spiritual Cultivation attributes, the demi-saint’s Spiritual Cultivation life diagram was quite normal.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw that Master Siren had an unremarkable Life force. The ancient swordsman was not outstanding in this aspect and was very mediocre.</p><p>Master Dean’s Life Force was much higher. After all, he was relatively young and had mastered the Spatial Upanishad. His future was bright.</p><p>Fang Wenxin was aging!</p><p>He looked on par with Master Siren, but his Life Force was much weaker, like an Elder in his twilight years.</p><p>“A Spiritual Cultivator should have a very long lifespan…”</p><p>After careful observation, Xu Xiaoshou found that the life in Fang Wenxin’s body was scattered about.</p><p>It flowed through intangible threads to the ghost beast’s soul inside the Blood Shadow copper coin, and it never came back.</p><p>With the powerful self-recovery ability of a demi-saint, he could sustain this kind of consumption, but he could not resist the bad state of ‘not able to make ends meet’.</p><p>“Was his life force stolen by a ghost beast?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart trembled. He had to pay such a price in order to control the Blood Shadow copper coin?</p><p>Very quickly, he realized that Fang Wenxin must be well aware of it.</p><p>Then, the only explanation was that he fed the ghosts with his body to maintain the ghost beast’s soul essence in the Blood Shadow copper coin…</p><p>When he thought of this, Xu Xiaoshou was slightly moved.</p><p>This first-generation of the red-clothed people was indeed an old senior that was worthy of praise. He truly lived up to his reputation.</p><p>When he turned his Perception, Xu Xiaoshou saw the people in Jade Capital City who were as insignificant as ants. There were also three ancient swordsman outside the city who also had ordinary Life Force.</p><p>Suddenly, he saw something that gave him a tremendous shock!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked over and saw Elder Yu, whose blood and Qi surged boundlessly. It was as if he faced an unfathomable vast ocean.</p><p>This old man’s vitality was too majestic!</p><p>Compared to Zhong Yuanzi and the others, there was a thousand times, ten thousand times difference!</p><p>However, in the previous battle, his performance was ordinary. He was not weak. He had some brilliance, but he was certainly far from the level of a peak demi-saint.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
