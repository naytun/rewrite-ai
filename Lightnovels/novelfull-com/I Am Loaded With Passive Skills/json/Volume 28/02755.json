He tore open Dao Xuanji’s abdomen with his claws, pulling out countless spirit threads from her body.</p><p>Puppet Manipulation Thread!</p><p>With the help of the Body of Devour, he quickly began to swallow the demonic aura of the Fourth Sword surrounding Dao Xuanji.</p><p>By maintaining a balance of the demonic aura, he could keep Dao Xuanji alive, causing her to lose all combat strength while keeping her mind clear.</p><p>Then… she would answer his questions!</p><p>“If you move again, you will die.”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Dao Xuanji became irritable.</p><p>She had never suffered such humiliation, being reduced to a state where even her death was controlled by someone else.</p><p>Her body suddenly swelled as she tried to self-destruct, just as she had done before.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou was ready. He was already prepared after the lessons of the past.</p><p>The moment the Engulfing Power was cut off, the demonic aura of the Fourth Sword surged, causing Dao Xuanji to go berserk, her movements abruptly halted again.</p><p>…</p><p>It was utterly humiliating!</p><p>Under the gaze of thousands of people in Jade Capital City, they couldn’t bear to see the current Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace being humiliated in such a manner.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Fang Wenxin, Zhong Yuanzi, and the others, who had recovered from their injuries after the earlier explosion, couldn’t stand it any longer. They immediately shouted and charged forward.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>With a spin of the Life Dao Disc, Xu Xiaoshou transformed into an Ultimate Giant in an instant.</p><p>Jade Capital City was suddenly plunged into fear once again.</p><p>The giant’s palm sent the two demi-saints flying, smashing them into spatial fragments, where they disappeared without a trace.</p><p>After shrinking back down, Xu Xiaoshou returned. He turned sideways in mid-air, holding the Flame Python in his hand, and with a single slash behind him, unleashed a roaring blaze.</p><p>“Those who cross the boundary, die.”</p><p>The entire arena fell into a deathly silence.</p><p>Everyone watched the black-robed, nine-tailed figure who had publicly humiliated Hallmaster Xuanji, and they could feel an overwhelming killing intent.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was furious.</p><p>When he saw his little junior sister have such a massive reaction just from glancing at Dao Xuanji, he didn’t fully understand what she was going through at that moment, but it was clear that she was enduring immense pain.</p><p>Mu Zixi’s consciousness had emerged as a means to escape pain. If she was reacting this way, the Lei family must have suffered severe injuries.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>The young girl’s body trembled lightly, tears streaming down like rain. She clung to her senior brother’s hand, too afraid to let go, her voice filled with fear.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sheathed his sword and turned to her, gently rubbing her head before closing her eyes softly.</p><p>“Sleep for a while. You’ll feel better after you sleep.”</p><p>He pulled his little junior sister into his arms and activated his Engulfing Power.</p><p>But instead of using the Life Dao Disc to supply Life force to Mu Zixi, he began to plunder it.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>As her Life force dissipated, Mu Zixi’s eyes rolled back, her “juvenization” was undone, and her body gradually lengthened, filling out the loose dress she wore.</p><p>Finally, Xu Xiaoshou felt that the boiling soul fluctuation of the person in his arms had calmed. Only then did he stop the Engulfing Power.</p><p>“Whoa!”</p><p>A massive Reborn Lily bloomed in the void.</p><p>Mu Zixi fell into a deep sleep. When she opened her eyes again, stepping through the black and white God Devil Mist, it was Lei Xi’er, with even her hair now returned to a silvery white.</p><p>Fury was wordless.</p><p>Vengeance was silent.</p><p>The one who had the most right to scream and vent all her past emotions was calm after she awoke.</p><p>“You can take revenge. No matter the method, I’ll be by your side. Absolutely!” Xu Xiaoshou said softly.</p><p>Lei Xi’er looked up at the face in front of her and gently shook her head.</p><p>She broke free from Xu Xiaoshou’s embrace. With her God Devil Eyes, she glanced at the figure shrouded in devilish energy.</p><p>“Dao Xuanji…”</p><p>She said nothing more.</p><p>Lei Xi’er lowered her gaze, looking down at Jade Capital City.</p><p>…</p><p>“What is he trying to do!”</p><p>Fang Wenxin was held back by Zhong Yuanzi.</p><p>The two Saints stopped before the white flame sword mark. After returning, they dared not step forward.</p><p>The Ultimate Giant hadn’t truly fought them. He had only slapped the two away from the Arena.</p><p>But regardless of the distance, for demi-saints, it could be reached in an instant.</p><p>“We can’t go over.” Zhong Yuanzi was unusually clear-headed and advised, “When I’m in my ghost beast form, Xu Xiaoshou can swallow most of my abilities and then reflect them.”</p><p>“Your Blood Shadow copper coin can’t capture the soul of Greedy the Cat Spirit anymore. If you rely on brute strength, you won’t withstand the giant that can tear apart a Holy Emperor!”</p><p>“Right now, Xu Xiaoshou isn’t much weaker than either of us. Even in a death battle, it’s very likely we’d be the ones to fall.”</p><p>“If we want to stop him, there’s only one person in the Arena who can do it…”</p><p>Fang Wenxin followed Zhong Yuanzi’s gaze, looking at Elder Yu.</p><p>But Elder Yu’s focus wasn’t on the Arena. He was holding his great-granddaughter’s hand, softly trying to persuade her of something.</p><p>“Who is she looking for?”</p><p>Fang Wenxin didn’t eavesdrop. Instead, he turned back to the Arena and looked at Lei Xi’er.</p><p>To his surprise, he didn’t see any hatred in the girl’s eyes towards Dao Xuanji. There wasn’t even the desire to stab or cut her.</p><p>Once she regained consciousness, it seemed that something more important than revenge occupied her mind…</p><p>Searching for someone?</p><p>…</p><p>Lei Xi’er was indeed searching for someone.</p><p>She didn’t know what had transpired in the world during her unconsciousness.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had managed to fight his way from the Central Yuan world to Jade Capital City and capture Dao Xuanji.</p><p>But she knew that accomplishing all of this was no easy feat!</p><p>Since there was now an opportunity to reveal past secrets to the public, venting personal emotions was secondary. The primary goal was to restore the honor of the Lei family.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
