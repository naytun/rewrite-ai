Could I be the next one?”</p><p>“D*mn, keep dreaming!”</p><p>…</p><p>Under everyone’s gaze, Xu Xiaoshou was suddenly pulled back from his “carefree” state by the violent emotions of Greedy the Cat Spirit.</p><p>He broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>He had only comprehended seventy percent…</p><p>He had almost assimilated with the Great Path! He thought, “Was this the terrifying aspect of the Way of the Heavens?”</p><p>However, being connected to Greedy the Cat Spirit’s Godhood at this moment was a great opportunity. At least he wouldn’t truly wander into the higher void and never return.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought, “And seventy percent, is that my limit?”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“According to Dao Qiongcang’s theory and my current understanding of ‘life’…”</p><p>“The Life Dao Disc is at most at the same level as the Celestial Scroll. It even falls short compared to the Master Dean’s Spatial Upanishad array diagram…”</p><p>“D*mn it, Water Ghost and Ye Xiaotian are indeed extraordinary geniuses. How can humans comprehend eighty percent of the Power Upanishad Formation?”</p><p>“Oh, right, there’s an even more terrifying Yu Lingdi. He’s even younger!”</p><p>The closer he got!</p><p>The more Xu Xiaoshou realized just how terrifying the talents of the geniuses in this world were!</p><p>Perhaps because the first Great Dao Disc he comprehended was the Life Dao Disc, Xu Xiaoshou dared to assert that Dao Qiongcang’s theory might be correct.</p><p>Eighty percent was the limit for Spiritual Cultivators!</p><p>If he truly wanted to gain enlightenment beyond this, it might not be about whether a Spiritual Cultivator could achieve it.</p><p>The real question was whether continuing to comprehend would lead to assimilation by the Great Path, or if it would result in “death” or “eternal life”!</p><p>With this basic evidence, he reflected on Dao Qiongcang’s claim…</p><p>Xiao Kongtong achieved eight out of ten in the Way of the Sword, and the Bazhun’an achieved nine out of ten.</p><p>Ninety percent! Or even higher!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt deep respect and skepticism for the Eighth.</p><p>“Seal the sword to old age, and I become a Saint.”</p><p>He wondered if the term Saint could have referred only to the tenth realm Holy Emperor, or if it implied something even beyond, directly achieving Godhood.</p><p>Respect was one thing, but Xu Xiaoshou never belittled himself.</p><p>He steeled his resolve and thought that if Bazhun’an could reach ninety percent, aiming for eighty percent was not too much to ask for!</p><p>“Life Dao Disc (71%).”</p><p>“Life Dao Disc (72%).”</p><p>“Life Dao Disc (80%).”</p><p>He didn’t stop and broke through directly!</p><p>When the progress under his feet broke through the eighty mark, Xu Xiaoshou felt that the world had become a form of life, and he was the Ruler of this world.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The ghostly energy vortex shook.</p><p>The Nine-Tailed Giant let out a long howl.</p><p>A miraculous phenomenon descended from the heavens, as a saintly rain fell, nourishing all living things.</p><p>Everyone in Jade Capital City felt their bodies and souls being cleansed by the surging life energy as if they had taken precious medicine.</p><p>Countless people cheered and sang, intoxicated by this wave of life.</p><p>Nine-Tailed Giant’s feet suddenly blossomed. It was so immense that it covered the entire Jade Capital City. It even extended into the spatial fragments and flowed towards the nameless Life Power Upanishad Formation, without being detected.</p><p>Even Zhong Yuanzi was lost in this splendid scene.</p><p>Only Ye Xiaotian remained awake!</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s eyes were bloodshot. Beneath his feet, a similarly vast but less majestic Spatial Upanishad array diagram blossomed.</p><p>He made a comparison…</p><p>His Power Upanishad Formation, apart from differences in attributes, was nearly identical in brilliance and complexity to the Nine-Tailed Giant’s formation.</p><p>He couldn’t tell if it was an illusion, but Xu Xiaoshou’s seemed to be brighter than his.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian glared at the Nine-Tailed Giant, clenching his fists in jealousy and gritting his teeth.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you deserve to die…”</p><p>…</p><p>The world was lost.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou woke up from the warm and vast sea of life. He saw a graceful human figure beside him.</p><p>He realized he was still in the spiritual world.</p><p>He was lost in thought.</p><p>Suddenly, the human figure jumped over and pounced on him. His cheeks were wet, and then he heard a low call.</p><p>“Meow.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>What he heard wasn’t just a cat’s meow, but another beautiful sound.</p><p>“Master”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
