Hallmaster Xuanji, please don’t put me in a difficult position again.” Gu Yu’s face was deathly pale.</p><p>“It’s just to add a bit of weight, to aid Elder Gu to defeat Xu. There’s actually no difference if I give this semi-saint person now or later.”</p><p>“It’s inappropriate, it’s totally inappropriate!”</p><p>Beibei almost burst out in laughter when she heard that. She covered her mouth as her shoulders heaved in mirth.</p><p>It was wonderful.</p><p>Had he run out of ideas?</p><p>Hallmaster Xuanji was too good at the art of manipulation!</p><p>The two of them pushed and shoved as they exchanged the art of Lip Spear, Tongue Sword. It could be seen that Gu Yu did not try to resist but he really did not dare to take it.</p><p>In the end, he simply picked up the semi-saint person and placed it on the long table.</p><p>But at the same time, there was an empty space in front of everyone. Dao Xuanji had moved the long table in advance.</p><p>“Ouch!”</p><p>Beibei fell to the ground, face first with a thud. Suddenly, she felt a Sword Will sweep across the hall, and she quickly raised her head.</p><p>The semi-saint person was placed on the table that silently shifted to a corner of the Saint Hall.</p><p>Dao Xuanji looked at Gu Yu silently.</p><p>Gu Yu could only sigh as he cupped his fists and did not dare to look at her.</p><p>No one dared to speak, nor did they dare to speak up for Dao Xuanji or Gu Yu.</p><p>“Space-Time Transition.”</p><p>Li Fuyu waved her hand, either in surprise or if she used her sword, but the table immediately returned to its original position.</p><p>She reached out for the semi-saint person and examined it with great care.</p><p>“This is the sanctification item of this era…”</p><p>“Miss Li is also interested in the semi-saint person?” Dao Xuanji turned around in time, but Li Fuyu had already put down the semi-saint person.</p><p>“I’m only interested in Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>It could be seen that this girl really had no other desires. The semi-saint person was just another piece of stone to her.</p><p>Dao Xuanji immediately lost the will to try and persuade him further.</p><p>She understood the Sword Maniac…. Dao Xuanji returned silently to the main seat and her tone was filled with self-blame.</p><p>“I was rude.”</p><p>“The Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe is always open to wise men. As I said, Elder Gu is free to come and go, but don’t forget about the battle.”</p><p>When Gu Yu heard that she was willing to let him go, he heaved a sigh of relief. He quickly cupped his fists and bowed. He did not dare to say anything else and quickly left the Saint Hall.</p><p>“Miss Li…”</p><p>Dao Xuanji looked at Li Fuyu.</p><p>Li Fuyu nodded, then stood up and walked out of the Saint Hall.</p><p>“That did not seem too pleasant?”</p><p>Beibei pulled the table over and shrugged as she looked at Lord Nine Sacrificial Osmanthus.</p><p>The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body patted Beibei’s head lovingly and looked back at Dao Xuanji.</p><p>“You said it yourself. Xu Xiaoshou learned everything by observation. Beibei and the two of them are both ancient swordsmen. Isn’t this not giving them away for free?”</p><p>Yes! Giving it away for free!</p><p>Beibei nodded intently. Lord Nine Sacrifices had the most insight.</p><p>However, Hallmaster Xuanji was not stupid. She must have understood what was going on. Beibei did not say anything. She just watched.</p><p>A fool should talk less and learn more.</p><p>Dao Xuanji had already made up her mind and she muttered.</p><p>“First of all, digestion takes time.”</p><p>“Beibei and Li Fuyu might still be lacking, but Xu Xiaoshou definitely can’t digest Gu Yu’s realm.”</p><p>“You’ve seen the retraced images of the Yunlun Mountain Range. Xu Xiaoshou’s Wisdom is Emptiness and Mei Siren’s…”</p><p>Dao Xuanji paused and did not wait for the demi-saint to lower her eyes. She was slightly disappointed and said. “The difference is like a cloud and mud.”</p><p>Indeed…</p><p>Beibei nodded in agreement.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou’s second realm was just the beginning, then Master Siren’s should be perfect, just one step away from reaching the peak.</p><p>“In other words, the second realm of the Ancient Sword Technique is his limit.” Dao Xuanji sneered. “If you want to feed him, then feed him until he explodes!”</p><p>“What if it didn’t explode and was digested by him? Beibei said weakly. She was really afraid of this. After all, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t be compared with common sense.</p><p>Dao Xuanji leaned back in her chair again and her posture became more relaxed. “That’s why I said from the very beginning that we have to start from other aspects.”</p><p>The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body realized that the siblings had something in common!</p><p>“Tell me quickly.” She urged, afraid that Dao Xuanji would suddenly say, “Heaven’s secrets cannot be revealed.”</p><p>Dao Xuanji didn’t have the bad habit of keeping people in suspense, but her habits weren’t very good either. At least, she didn’t like to speak openly.</p><p>She looked into the sky and called out.</p><p>“Jiang Nayi!”</p><p>Jiang Nayi, who was covered in blood and whose face was swollen, appeared.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Dao Xuanji waved her hand, and Jiang Nayi hurriedly nodded. After he took a deep breath, he shouted.</p><p>“Ran Ming!”</p><p>Divine light descended from the sky and Jiang Nayi disappeared.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Beibei was dumbfounded.</p><p>The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body seemed to have realized something and said. “You want to use him to call people back from inside?”</p><p>The people who died in the Ran Ming ruins would not really die. Instead, they would return to their original positions, which was beneficial for the god slayer trial.</p><p>This was something that the Holy Divine Palace had instructed the people to verify under Dao Qiongcang’s consideration.</p><p>“Lord Nine Sacrifices, please understand.”</p><p>Dao Xuanji stroked the armrest of her chair and muttered to herself. “There’s no need for anyone else. The three of you just need to hold him back. Once Ai Cangsheng is back, Xu Xiaoshou will definitely be executed!”</p><p>When she heard these powerful words, the Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body finally understood that Dao Xuanji wasn’t arrogant after her defeat and didn’t dare to underestimate Xu Xiaoshou anymore.</p><p>She treated it as if the Ten High Nobles were at war!</p><p>She would lead the mature Ten High Nobles to kill those who had the potential to become the Ten High Nobles according to Dao Qiongcang, but hadn’t fully matured!</p><p>“I’ve lost any consideration.”</p><p>The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body pondered for a moment and apologized for her previous doubts. She agreed with Dao Xuanji’s explanation.</p><p>After all, if even the Ten High Nobles couldn’t kill Xu Xiaoshou, then there would be no one to stop him. If that happened, the Holy Emperors would have to lower themselves.</p><p>“Will it work? Xu Xiaoshou is good at running, and Hallmaster Dao is good at chasing. He could not catch him before?” Beibei was very skeptical.</p><p>“He won’t run.” Dao Xuanji said calmly.</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Because his Master is in our hands.”</p><p>Beibei was stunned. She suddenly shuddered.</p><p>Although Hallmaster Xuanji and Hallmaster Dao were siblings, they had two different personalities and these two were extremes.</p><p>“Then what if, what if…”</p><p>Beibei used the word what if twice in a row. She still thought like how Hallmaster Dao thought. What if something unexpected happened and Xu Xiaoshou ran away?”</p><p>Dao Xuanji fell silent.</p><p>Her blank eyes made Beibei’s heart palpitate.</p><p>When the Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body pulled the child behind her, she looked away indifferently.</p><p>“Beibei.”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“You don’t know this, right? The only time Bazhun’an was defeated was through my hands… Can Xu Xiaoshou surpass him?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
