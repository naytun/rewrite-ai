He turned to look at Hallmaster Xuanji, “Xu Xiaoshou is very impulsive. If three Saints can’t stop him…”</p><p>“With three Saints and three ancient swordsmen behind him, he doesn’t have the energy to attack the Sacred Mountain,” Dao Xuanji shouted coldly.</p><p>So…</p><p>Would it really just be a challenge from an ancient sword cultivator to fight for the name of the Seven Sword Deity?</p><p>Would this work?</p><p>Xi suppressed his doubts. There was no need to ask about things that the Hallmaster had already decided on. This was a good habit that he had developed.</p><p>“If the three Saints fight to the death, and the destroyed Xuanji great array is unable to be repaired in time, I’m afraid there will be countless casualties…”</p><p>“What?” Dao Xuanji felt as if her scar had been touched. She glared coldly. “Are you doubting my ability?”</p><p>“I wouldn’t dare!” Xi was frightened and stepped back.</p><p>“Even if the great array can’t be repaired and Xu Xiaoshou dares to make a ruckus, will he really dare to massacre the city?!” Dao Xuanji flicked her sleeves.</p><p>As soon as she said this, the Saint Hall suddenly fell silent.</p><p>Xi looked over in shock, and Beibei also turned around in shock. The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body’s expression also turned blank.</p><p>Dao Xuanji realized that she had misspoken and took a deep breath before saying,</p><p>“I’ve investigated Xu Xiaoshou before. He did the same thing when he was in Dongtianwang City.”</p><p>“On the surface, he looks bold and reckless, but in reality, he’s just playing with Rao Yaoyao’s mind and has other motives.”</p><p>“He won’t go too far.”</p><p>Perhaps he won’t, but they can’t gamble like this!</p><p>If Hallmaster Dao was still around, he would definitely put the lives of the people of Jade Capital City at the top of his list. He wouldn’t treat it as part of the gamble!</p><p>Xi wanted to say something but stopped.</p><p>In the end, it was Beibei who reached out and pulled him back.</p><p>“Hallmaster Xuanji, we’ll set off first!”</p><p>“Remember to repair great array quickly. Don’t forget…”</p><p>Beibei grabbed Xi and left without turning her head.</p><p>There were only two Saints left in the hall.</p><p>The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body stared at Dao Xuanji without making a sound.</p><p>“I made a slip of the tongue just now. My thoughts and considerations have yet to turn to my identity as the Hallmaster. I won’t make such a mistake again in the future.” Dao Xuanji sighed and admitted her mistake.</p><p>“Even the Three Emperors, even if they are free, they can’t say such a thing!” The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body said in a deep voice.</p><p>“Lord Nine Sacrifices is right,”</p><p>“Rest well… Hmm, the Xuanji great array has been broken, so there’s no time for you to rest.”</p><p>The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body turned around and disappeared from the hall.</p><p>Dao Xuanji watched as he left. She stared in the direction where he disappeared and was lost in thought for a long time.</p><p>The empty Saint Hall regained its peace.</p><p>Far below the Sacred Mountain, the chaos and abnormal movements in the Jade Capital City seemed to have nothing to do with her as long as she closed her eyes.</p><p>Dao Xuanji turned around and looked at her seat on the long black table.</p><p>In reality, the things and matters they fought for in childhood, once they use every means to obtain them as adults, they find that the happiness they bring is far less enduring than they had imagined.</p><p>There were two sides to everything, just like Dao Qiongcang liked to say, good fortune and bad fortune depended on each other.</p><p>To put it bluntly, this seat was just a chair.</p><p>Only when one really sat on it would one know what it felt like to be sitting on pins and needles while looking extremely glorious on the surface.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Dao Xuanji muttered to herself silently. She pinched the space between her eyebrows and walked out of the hall to the screen.</p><p>The land of Screen and Candles of Sacred Mountain Guizhe was a forbidden area.</p><p>When Hua Changdeng was in seclusion, even Dao Qiongcang had to ask for permission to enter. Only Yue Gongli dared to enter.</p><p>But now, there was no such restriction.</p><p>Dao Xuanji walked to the core of the Land of Screen and Candles.</p><p>It was still dark here. There was a broken willow, a square table, and a broken lamp. However, everything had changed. Hua Changdeng had already left.</p><p>“Lord God Worship Willow Tree, you have awakened. The Sacred Mountain is in trouble, and I need your help.” Dao Xuanji’s expression was pious and her tone respectful.</p><p>Wu—</p><p>The screen lit up the ground, and the candles flickered, emitting a strange humming sound that made people shudder.</p><p>At the base of the Ancestral Tree, where the God Worship Willow Tree’s broken stump stands, there was no response.</p><p>“Lord Nine Sacrificial Osmanthus cannot leave the mountain so easily. Now that Jade Capital City is in trouble, the Sacred Mountain is empty.”</p><p>“I need strength to help the Sacred Mountain overcome this crisis.”</p><p>“He’s an ancient swordsman, and he’s a disciple of You Tu’s lineage.”</p><p>The God Worship Willow Tree seemed to sway.</p><p>Soon, with a cracking sound, the fresh green on it fell.</p><p>Dao Xuanji reached out to hold it.</p><p>Balls of light shrunk, and the object in her palm turned into a tiny willow leaf, but its surface was dull.</p><p>“Thank you for your help, Elder.”</p><p>Dao Xuanji didn’t keep this leaf. After turning around and leaving, she casually consumed it.</p><p>…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The sky above the Jade Capital City was grotesque and motley.</p><p>The moment the Xuanji great array was broken, the countless Divine Array’s patterns exploded like fireworks in the sky.</p><p>“Run, the great array has been broken!”</p><p>“Impossible! Hallmaster Xuanji said that this array can protect the Jade Capital City for a hundred years. How can it be broken in half a day?”</p><p>“Then continue with this disbelief. I’ll leave first as a form of respect…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, he…he hasn’t even turned into his biggest giant form yet. He only turned into a golden giant. How could he break the great array with just a step?”</p><p>“Hallmaster Xuanji is dead! She has already been beheaded, and you’re not running? Are you waiting for Xu Xiaoshou to slaughter the whole city?”</p><p>“No need to run.”</p><p>“Get lost. Don’t stop me. If you want to die for the city, die for yourself. I’m not a fool…If we don’t run now, when will we?”</p><p>“I am Li Fugui. Trust me, Lord Shou will not massacre the city.”</p><p>“As if I will believe you!”</p><p>“Ouch.”</p><p>Li Fugui took a punch for no reason, and his figure became even more miserable. Almost no one noticed him in the crowd.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
