He had a pleasant look and there was condensed qi around his body. He looked alert and ready to attack and his sword power was strong.</p><p>“Gu Yu, Old Senior Gu?”</p><p>Beibei turned around and her eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>This was an ancient swordsman from You Tu and Mei Siren’s era. In terms of the Way of the Sword, she could not be mentioned in the same breath as him.</p><p>He was supposed to be one of the Seven Sword Deity from the previous year. Coincidentally, he had gone into seclusion to comprehend the sword during the Seven Sword Deity selection.</p><p>He did not accept any of the battle invitations and this caused him to be eliminated from the top position in the initial rankings.</p><p>After that, Bazhun’an defeated the other sects with the Witness Sword Technique and came in from behind to get the title of the Eighth Sword Deity. He continued to fight even as the Seven Sword Deity’s value continued to rise.</p><p>Elder Gu had fallen behind by an entire era and had no fame or power. The entire community of the ancient swordsman felt sad for him.</p><p>This time, he had once again been selected into the initial ranking for the Seven Sword Deity. He was clearly here to serve as a stabilizing pillar to suppress the ranking of the Seven Sword Deity.</p><p>Two Elders, Yi Xiao and Li Fuyu.</p><p>The Two Elders referred to Gu Yu and Yang Xizhi.</p><p>In other words, Gu Yu was at the top of the initial ranking of the Seven Sword Deity, the first Sword Deity!</p><p>His benchmarks were the previous batch of people, You Tu and Mei Siren.</p><p>You Tu the Seventh Sword beheaded the previous Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>On Abyss Island, Mei Siren could use his higher void body to kill the incarnation of demi-saint Jiang Buyi.</p><p>Gu Yu was their fellow practitioner; they had grown up through their sword battles, how could his strength be weaker?</p><p>This old senior was also here to beat up Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Don’t bully others!</p><p>“Oh…”</p><p>Beibei glanced at Hallmaster Xuanji in shock.</p><p>She really didn’t know how she managed to persuade Elder Gu to lower himself to fight the younger generation. This would even make his good friend Mei Siren laugh at him.</p><p>However, Beibei did not ask further. She only looked at the woman behind Elder Gu as if she had sensed something.</p><p>It was only because of the intuition of the ancient swordsman…</p><p>Beibei’s pupils constricted. She was certain that this woman was not much weaker than Old Gu!</p><p>“You are…”</p><p>The woman had a graceful figure that was ten times better than her own and she wore a simple sword robe. Her hair was casually tied up behind her head with a wooden hairpin.</p><p>Her appearance was even more outstanding. Even without makeup, she still looked natural and elegant. If she put on a little makeup, who knew how beautiful she would be.</p><p>However, this woman did not seem to know how to dress herself up at all. She was extremely simple and unadorned. The only highlight on her body could only be understood by an ancient swordsman…</p><p>“Good sword!”</p><p>Beibei’s eyes lit up when she noticed the pure white sword at the woman’s waist.</p><p>Even though the sword had yet to be unsheathed, she could feel the Sword Will that surged within. It was full of charm and should not be inferior to the Supreme Emperor Sword.</p><p>Among the Five Great Divine Instruments of Chaos, how could there be a sword that looked like this?</p><p>However, other than those five swords, other than the most famous ones among the famed swords, what other swords could match this kind of Sword Will?</p><p>There was no such sword among the 21 Famed Swords… Beibei was confused. She actually had a sword that she couldn’t recognize. This was very strange!</p><p>“Little girl, there is no need to doubt your judgment. This was because the old me had once doubted myself. However, later I saw it…”</p><p>Gu Yu laughed lightly and spoke up for the ancient swordsman beside him. He knew that this Sword Maniac might not answer.</p><p>The reason why he could recognize this sword was because he had lived for a long time already and had seen some ancient secret diagrams.</p><p>“Sword tower, guardian of the seven of the twelve swords!”</p><p>Inside the Saint Hall, Gu Yu’s words fell, but Dao Xuanji and the Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body remained indifferent.</p><p>Beibei stood up abruptly and said in disbelief.</p><p>“Sword God Gu Louying’s saber?!”</p><p>As soon as she said that, Dao Xuanji and the Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body were stunned. They looked at the saber that belonged to the plainly dressed woman and their eyes gradually filled with shock.</p><p>Sword God’s sword?</p><p>The twelfth sword of the sword tower was called the sword tower sword. The Holy Divine Palace had searched for an entire era, but they couldn’t even find any trace of it.</p><p>The ancient swordsmen of the Shengshen Continent, and even the Spiritual Cultivators, had searched for hundreds of years, but they could not find any trace of it.</p><p>Now…</p><p>It had appeared on the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe!</p><p>The Southern Region’s Feng family was ranked on the Seven Sword Deity listing, and everyone in the continent had never doubted it. Why?</p><p>This was because their ancestors could be traced back to the era of the Sword God. There was a man known as Feng Wuhen, who was second only to one person and above ten thousand people.</p><p>Feng Wuhen had created the sword pavilion and left behind his legacy that protected the Feng family through countless generations. Even if there was a storm, the bloodline would last forever.</p><p>However, this sword pavilion was recorded in the internal history of the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe. It was built to compete with the sword tower and was unwilling to be outdone.</p><p>Then what was the sword tower?</p><p>Sword God Gu Louying wasn’t his original name, but a name that was used by the world to commemorate something after it was forgotten, so it was created through form visualization.</p><p>The origin of this name came from the only image left behind by the Sword God, one of the Ten Ancestors, in this world. It was a picture.</p><p>It was a picture of ten swords that suppressed a tower. In the picture, it was night time and there was a building. The top of the tower appeared as a silhouette under the moon, hence the name Guo Louying.</p><p>The building referred to the sword tower!</p><p>No one knew the location of the sword tower. It was even more mysterious than Abyss Island.</p><p>The latter would appear once in a thousand years, but the former had always been a legend and was never a reality.</p><p>Outsiders might not be aware of this, but everyone in the Saint Hall knew…</p><p>The Nine Major Sword Techniques, the Eighteen Sword Forms, and the 3000 Sword Styles, all of these originated from the sword tower!</p><p>The picture of the ten swords that suppressed the tower was handed down from a certain Sword Human of the sword tower after he was drunk!</p><p>The Sword God’s twelve sabers were all locked in the sword tower!</p><p>The Southern Region’s Feng Family owned the sword tower that protected their clan from destruction. The things passed down from the sword tower gave rise to all the ancient swordsmen in the world today.</p><p>Legend had it that the divine sword Feng Wuhen imitated the Sword God and left his legacy in the sword pavilion. Up until now, no descendant of the bloodline had been able to inherit it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
