Only Xu Xiaoshou’s finger was gently tapping on her forehead.</p><p>Just now…</p><p>Was it all an illusion?</p><p>She swept her surroundings with her spiritual sense.</p><p>Her Supreme Master was still on the spot, and she didn’t turn into a Nightmare Ghost to pounce on her.</p><p>There was no coldness or hatred in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes.</p><p>He was an outsider. While maintaining the current balance of the situation, he prevented her cultivation deviation</p><p>Her energy reserve fluctuated, and her spiritual source was unstable.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen hurriedly stepped back and avoided Xu Xiaoshou’s direct gaze. She felt so inferior that she didn’t dare to meet his eyes.</p><p>Her face was as white as a sheet, and she seemed to have lost her soul.</p><p>As she looked at everyone in disbelief, Lei Shuangxing’s words echoed in her mind.</p><p>“So…”</p><p>“My Pearl Gem Star Eyes, whose are they?”</p><p>In the end, Yu Zhiwen’s despairing gaze landed on Lei Shuangxing. She had to verify it.</p><p>“The Pearl Gem Star Eyes aren’t yours. They belong to my younger sister,” Lei Shuangxing’s voice was indifferent.</p><p>Younger sister?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s thoughts froze and she turned her head to the side.</p><p>She wasn’t the only one. All of the conscious Spiritual Cultivators in Jade Capital, all of the Saints in the city, including Elder Yu, were all staring at Lei Xi’er in astonishment.</p><p>Pearl Gem Star Eyes…</p><p>Hers?</p><p>The hatred of having her eyes stolen could be avenged immediately!</p><p>The person who stole the eyes was right in front of her face!</p><p>What kind of strength supports Lei Xi’er to maintain such a calm demeanor, even waking up without saying a word and simply searching for Yu Zhiwen?</p><p>The sparkling and translucent Pearl Gem Star Eyes could analyze the secrets of the Way of Heavens. The vast galaxy was deeply embedded in the bottom of her eyes, and one glance was enough to intoxicate people…</p><p>Now, it seemed that there was only endless sin!</p><p>Lei Xi’er was still calmly looking at Yu Zhiwen, looking into her eyes.</p><p>Under the other party’s despairing and chaotic gaze, which was still yearning for the final answer, she nodded slightly.</p><p>“My eyes.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s eyes suddenly lost color.</p><p>At this moment, too many images flashed through her mind.</p><p>There was their first meeting in the Tiansang Spirit Palace, their encounter in the White Cave, their interaction in the pocket dimension of Yuan Mansion, and their observation in Yunlun Mountain Range…</p><p>And now!</p><p>Too many interactions.</p><p>From going down the Sacred Mountain to the Jade Capital City, they had experienced too much, even if she did not interact with her for long every time…</p><p>She, Yu Zhiwen!</p><p>Was using Lei Xi’er’s eyes.</p><p>All the time, while acting recklessly in front of her.</p><p>She even received the world’s reputation and received thousands of praises.</p><p>As for her, Lei Xi’er, whenever they met, she would only pay attention behind her back and not say a word.</p><p>Thinking of this, Yu Zhiwen’s mind, which had yet to recover, was about to collapse.</p><p>How cruel!</p><p>She swore that she really did not know about this.</p><p>She could even swear a deadly oath in front of the world!</p><p>But…</p><p>Who would believe that?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen subconsciously retreated as if she feared the devil, but it was more like she was afraid of herself. Her voice became incoherent,</p><p>“I don’t know, I really don’t know…”</p><p>“In my memories, I was born with the Pearl Gem Star Eyes. I have the Lei family bloodline. I am not a sinner…”</p><p>“The Pearl Gem Star Eyes are mine? Not mine?”</p><p>Her voice suddenly stopped.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen turned her head, her eyes wide open as she looked at her Supreme Master who was covered in demonic energy.</p><p>In her mind, the figure of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man on Qingyuan Mountain appeared.</p><p>His question was like knocking on the door of her heart.</p><p>“Who told you these things?”</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>Who told her that?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen almost screamed. She covered her mouth and felt the world in front of her blur.</p><p>Supreme Master!</p><p>Her memories have been tampered with by her Supreme Master?</p><p>But how could it be…</p><p>Although Supreme Master was a little strict, that was because she had high hopes for her.</p><p>Although her Supreme Master wasn’t loving at all, she had cared and cared for her since she was young. Other than Grandpa Yu, she cared for her the most.</p><p>She was not a gentle person but from her attitude towards others and herself…</p><p>Yu Zhiwen didn’t believe that her Supreme Master would hurt her.</p><p>She felt that she had touched the truth, but why was the truth even more cruel and bloody?</p><p>…</p><p>“Calm down!”</p><p>Elder Yu managed to get to his great-granddaughter’s side in time to support her staggering figure.</p><p>He didn’t want Yu Zhiwen to have no one by her side anymore, or else a cultivation deviation may occur to her.</p><p>He frowned. He could sense that the Saint Servants did not have much hostility towards Little Yu. He could only look at Lei Shuangxing suspiciously.</p><p>“You said that the Pearl Gem Star Eyes are your sister’s…”</p><p>“But her eyes are clearly the God Devil Eyes. How do you explain this?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen suddenly woke up. When she looked back, a trace of hope appeared in her eyes.</p><p>This time, before Lei Shuangxing could say anything, Lei Xi’er said calmly,</p><p>“I died once.”</p><p>“Back then, I was still young. My Pearl Gem Star Eyes were dug out, my origin blood marrow was extracted, my meridians were broken, and my vitality was completely extinguished.”</p><p>“It was only with the Ultimate Life Demon Physique that I could, within the briefest moment after death, snatch back a breath and live on, concealing the truth from the heavens and the sea,”</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s gaze shifted from Elder Yu to Yu Zhiwen,</p><p>“This is still not enough.”</p><p>“The God Devil Eyes aren’t mine. It’s my brother’s.”</p><p>“He gave me the God Devil Eyes and gave me the blood of the God Devil Eye’s origin. With the power of the God Devil Eyes’ divinity, I was able to regain my life.”</p><p>Her voice was so calm, but it sounded like a hammer striking their souls.</p><p>The saints looked back at Lei Shuangxing and the black cloth around his eyes.</p><p>“Hallmaster Xuanji…”</p><p>Fang Wenxin looked at Dao Xuanji, who was in a state of madness, with only shock in his heart.</p><p>If it is said that ghosts and beasts deserve to be punished and can be killed at birth, how much should Dao Xuanji be punished?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
