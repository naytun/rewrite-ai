She’s asleep.”</p><p>“Oh, what’s her name?”</p><p>“Lei Xi’er.”</p><p>“I was learning how to fish from Grandpa Yu. He went to procrastinate again… Oh, right, my name is Yu Zhiwen. I’m Yu Zhiwen from Xia Mei Qiu Liang.”</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>“What’s your name?”</p><p>“Me? My name is…”</p><p>Her memory suddenly collapsed.</p><p>They had met a few times when they were young and played with each other a few times, but after they grew up, they became strangers.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that she had seen him in Tiansang Spirit Palace, Yu Zhiwen wouldn’t have been able to recognize this figure so quickly.</p><p>She looked into the distance.</p><p>The sound of a sword being thrust into the void grew increasingly piercing.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s thoughts were still shattered.</p><p>At a certain moment, her mind went blank again.</p><p>Just like what she had experienced when she met Lei Shuangxing in Tiansang Spirit Palace, when Lei Shuangxing got closer, the cold and resolute voice of her Supreme Master, which had also been sealed for a long time, echoed in the depths of her soul.</p><p>“The Lei family is secretly plotting to destroy Abyss Island!”</p><p>Swish. Her memory turned blood-red, but it was blurry.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s body trembled violently, but apart from the broken memories of their first meeting and ending, she could not help but feel a chill down her spine.</p><p>She realized that there should have been some childhood experiences between her and Lei Shuangxing, but she could not recall them at all.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing walked closer and closer.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen trembled uneasily.</p><p>Her instincts told her that she should retreat and stay away from this place. Otherwise, something bad would happen…</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s gaze was firm, and she didn’t take half a step back.</p><p>She came to find the truth.</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>Suddenly, she felt a sharp pain in her head, as if her soul was twitching. Yu Zhiwen covered her head and groaned in pain.</p><p>However, this time, she didn’t fall from the sky like she did when they met at the Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>She gritted her teeth and endured the inexplicable pain. She said with difficulty,</p><p>“Lei Shuangxing…”</p><p>…</p><p>Lei Shuangxing came with his sword.</p><p>He looked around calmly.</p><p>He didn’t even get close to Lei Xi’er. Instead, he walked toward Yu Zhiwen with a firm goal. He said coldly,</p><p>“Just as your Supreme Master said, you indeed have the Lei family bloodline.”</p><p>“If there was no Lei family bloodline, how could the Lei Family’s Eyes be activated?”</p><p>“If you didn’t have the Lei family bloodline, how could you have used the Lei Family’s Eyes to gain such great benefits in the Divine Secret and become famous as part of the Path Division?”</p><p>What did he mean?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned unconsciously.</p><p>So Yu Zhiwen was really half a Lei family member?</p><p>But if that was the case, how could Dao Xuanji accept her as a disciple? Wasn’t this raising a tiger to invite disaster?</p><p>Dao Xuanji was somewhat agitated, seeming on the verge of speaking up, even displaying a hint of killing intent directed at Lei Shuangxing’s sudden appearance.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly controlled the old woman by making her go crazy to restrict her from attacking.</p><p>“You guys continue.”</p><p>He looked at Lei Shuangxing, whom he had not seen for a long time, and nodded at Xuan Wuji, who had zero presence behind him.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing did not look back.</p><p>He had long lost the ability to “see” and only spoke out indiscriminately, as if announcing to the world, saying indifferently,</p><p>“Although you can possess and use the Lei Family’s Eyes, there is a limit. If you use it too much, it will cause harm to you and prolonged use will lead you to ruin.”</p><p>“Only by possessing the Lei family bloodline and using the origin blood to activate the origin Lei Family’s Eyes can you, Yu Zhiwen, become the current Chief of the Path Division.”</p><p>Origin blood?</p><p>Origin Lei Family’s Eyes?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s brows furrowed for a long time as he looked back at Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s eyelashes trembled slightly, but her starry eyes were still calm. After glancing at her speechless Supreme Master, she stared at Lei Shuangxing and said,</p><p>“So, my Supreme Master didn’t lie to me!”</p><p>Turning her eyes, she looked at Grandpa Yu, who was standing at the side, ready to attack. She seemed to be verifying and affirming herself.</p><p>“I have the Lei family bloodline!”</p><p>“The Pearl Gem Star Eyes were also not taken by force!”</p><p>Elder Yu’s eyelids twitched. He opened his mouth but couldn’t say anything.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen waited for a long time, but there was no response. The light in her eyes slowly disappeared.</p><p>“Ha!”</p><p>Lei Shuangxing shook his head and sneered, “Of course, your respected Supreme Master would not lie. However, the truth that was taken out of context is not a lie?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen found it difficult to make a sound, and could only stare blankly.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing’s voice sank, filled with grief as it spread in all directions,</p><p>“How simple is it to possess the Lei family bloodline?”</p><p>“Back then, the Lei family had rivers of blood and corpses all over the ground. Using the Divine Secret to obtain blood and replace them, wasn’t it easy?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s body trembled, and her pupils gradually dilated. However, Lei Shuangxing’s voice did not stop,</p><p>“The Pearl Gem Star Eyes are yours. That’s perfectly normal.”</p><p>“Because in your Supreme Master’s eyes, none of the Lei family’s Eyes belong to the Lei family!”</p><p>“They grow in the bodies of my Lei Family members, just like crops growing in the ground. Crops don’t belong to the earth. Once the Lei family members grow ripe, they should naturally be harvested!”</p><p>After a pause, Lei Shuangxing suddenly raised his head.</p><p>At this moment, through the black cloth covering his eyes, everyone in the Jade Capital City saw that Lei Shuangxing had a pair of eyes that could see. He stared at the Pearl Gem Star Eyes and shouted in a deep voice,</p><p>“And go into the bodies of high and mighty saints like you!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen staggered and almost fell.</p><p>The entire Jade Capital City was in a clamor, and the Spiritual Cultivators couldn’t believe their ears.</p><p>“So Yu… the Chief of Path Division borrowed, no, snatched the eyes?”</p><p>“The Pearl Gem Star Eyes aren’t Yu Zhiwen’s. Her Supreme Master dug them out for her. From the body of a Lei family member? Damn!”</p><p>“With her pretentious demeanor… Ugh, she should have known better, considering she’s used the Pearl Gem Star Eyes for so many years.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
