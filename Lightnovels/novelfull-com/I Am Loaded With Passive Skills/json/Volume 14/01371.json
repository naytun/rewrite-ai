It could not be that Xu Xiaoshou was Jiang Buyi, and Jiang Buyi was Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao felt that her brain wasn’t smart enough to process this.</p><p>“Sword Deity Rao!”</p><p>On the other side, Jiang Buyi could not bear it anymore.</p><p>He glared at Rao Yaoyao, unable to understand how this woman could tolerate her subordinate’s blasphemy towards a demi-saint!</p><p>However, Rao Yaoyao was confused and hesitated to speak.</p><p>“Alright, you won’t say anything, right?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi nodded slightly and lifted his sleeve. Holy Power gathered in his hand as he said, “Then if I attacked someone from the Holy Divine Palace today, it would have nothing to do with anything else but Teng Shanhai and his impertinent words.”</p><p>Teng Shanhai was amused.</p><p>He knew what Rao Yaoyao wanted him to pay attention to.</p><p>However, he was a boorish man, so how could he know how to phrase his words? Not to mention facing Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>He just couldn’t stand this appearance of Xu Xiaoshou. He was obviously putting on an act and didn’t even dare to make a move, but he still acted so high and mighty. Did he really think that he was a true demi-saint?</p><p>“If you have the guts, come over!”</p><p>“I’ll stand here today. Why don’t you try touching me?” Teng Shanhai curled his hand and mocked.</p><p>Just as he finished speaking.</p><p>With a boom, the world changed.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s hair and beard fluttered in the wind as his figure instantly disappeared from his original spot.</p><p>“W-”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao finally realized that something was wrong. The level of Holy Power on Jiang Buyi’s body really did not seem like it could be imitated by taking Holy Blood.</p><p>However, before she could say “wait,” Jiang Buyi moved and the time and space in the holy realm froze.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>Before Teng Shanhai could react, his vision turned dark as a figure blocked his view.</p><p>Jiang Buyi closed in. His palm, which was wrapped with cloud-type Holy Power, was like a sharp sword. It pierced through Teng Shanhai’s Cang God Armor like paper. His palm pierced through his chest and came out.</p><p>There was no mercy!</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Teng Shanhai’s single eye was as round as a ball as he glared at his opponent. The focus in his eyes disappeared and his mind went blank.</p><p>It wasn’t until the heart-piercing pain in his chest attacked him that he spat out blood on his face with a “pfft”.</p><p>“I-impossible…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou really attacked him?</p><p>Moreover, he broke through his Cang God Armor’s defense with one palm?</p><p>For any attack under the demi-saint realm, the Cang God Armor was unbreakable. Xu Xiaoshou was only at the master stage, so he could not do this. So he was not Xu Xiaoshou, but the actual Jiang Buyi?</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Teng Shanhai didn’t believe it!</p><p>If this guy was Jiang Buyi, why did he toy with him earlier?</p><p>This guy had even admitted that he was Xu Xiaoshou and told him about what had happened on Lone Cliff… On the Lone Cliff where Jiang Buyi was not there!</p><p>This was impossible, this was impossible, this was absolutely impossible!!!</p><p>Teng Shanhai’s mouth was full of blood and he could not speak clearly. He felt as if he had been crippled. Under Jiang Buyi’s gaze, he could not even move, let alone counterattack.</p><p>“Since you wanted to ‘try’, I granted you your wish.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi had one hand through his chest, but he did not pull it out. After saying this coldly, he lifted Teng Shanhai, who was more than a head taller than him and turned sideways, staring at Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>“I attacked because a demi-saint is not to be blasphemed.”</p><p>He paused for a moment and narrowed his eyes, hiding the coldness in them. “I won’t kill him, because your surname is Rao.”</p><p>“Gulp.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao swallowed her saliva.</p><p>She was only a Sword Deity and a higher void. Facing a demi-saint at such a close distance was no different from facing a Saint.</p><p>With just a glance, she felt that the image of the person in front of her was infinitely enlarged, bringing about a mental pressure that was completely irresistible!</p><p>Demi-saint…</p><p>They were not to be blasphemed by mortals!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao lowered her eyes, not daring to look him in the eye.</p><p>She had already understood that this was not Xu Xiaoshou, but the real Jiang Buyi.</p><p>However…</p><p>Did Teng Shanhai really get the wrong person?</p><p>“I’ll f*ck you! Ptui!”</p><p>At this moment, Teng Shanhai suddenly attacked. He pulled out his spear in anger and spat on Jiang Buyi’s face. He still wanted to fight back.</p><p>“Holy Blood, body forging, Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand! Only by combining these can one break through the Cang God Armor’s defense. Rao Yaoyao, can’t you see that Xu Xiaoshou is pretending?” At the same time, Teng Shanhai roared like a mad demon.</p><p>As soon as he said that, the entire place fell silent.</p><p>That mouthful of blood mixed with thick phlegm covered half of Jiang Buyi’s face. Some of it even shot into his ears. Jiang Buyi did not expect that Teng Shanhai would still not come to his senses and even dared to make false accusations!</p><p>He was stunned and did not react in time to dodge.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was also stunned.</p><p>Teng Shanhai was too confident. He was really too desperate!</p><p>However, during the night battle in the imperial city, Xu Xiaoshou did gather the Holy Blood, Saint Statue, and Holy Power. He had indeed used the “Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand” to take a hit from Xiao Divine Spear. Teng Shanhai was right, wasn’t he?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was hiding in the air, was also stunned by this scene. He clenched the communication talisman that was still ticking in his hand and felt that the world had suddenly become bright.</p><p>He had thought that as long as the three of them calmed down and had a conversation, he would be exposed.</p><p>He had never thought that…Man proposes but God disposes!</p><p>This Teng Shanhai was too dedicated! He was the male lead! He was the only one in any director’s heart! He gave him a sense of security!</p><p>“You even managed to round out the ‘Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand’? I didn’t give you a script, so how did you carry on a scene that even I couldn’t act anymore so smoothly?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was excited.</p><p>He felt that he might really be able to lead to a big ending, the kind that was unexpected.</p><p>Have a look at this.</p><p>Teng Shanhai’s blood and phlegm had even smeared a demi-saint’s face!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
