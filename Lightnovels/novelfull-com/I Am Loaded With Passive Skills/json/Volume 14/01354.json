Countdown to your death : Nine days, please atone for your mistakes!”</p><p>“Ha?”</p><p>As soon as Xu Xiaoshou stepped out of the Yuan Mansion with the face of the Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi and landed on the ground of the Abyss island, a piece of information suddenly flashed in his mind.</p><p>He was stunned.</p><p>“The Abyss Island Sinner must-kill list?”</p><p>“Nine days countdown to his death?’</p><p>“Does this mean I’m on the wanted list ? Just because of that small medicine garden?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickly found out why. This was the only big thing he had done on the Abyss Island.</p><p>So…</p><p>“The Holy Emperor’s Dragon Scale heartbeat did not sound just because of the Void Attendant. It is also due to the will of the Abyss Island?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pulled out the Holy Emperor’s Dragon Scale. He felt that the heartbeat was at the same rate as before, but he felt like he had comprehended something.</p><p>He suddenly felt a little nervous.</p><p>The Herb Garden of Divine Farmer had already been moved, so he couldn’t waste any time on regrets.</p><p>What he should consider now was whether the will of the Abyss Island would directly kill him or would an executioner be sent to do the job once the death countdown started?</p><p>“If it’s the former, the only way for me to survive is to hide in the Yuan Mansion or maintain the Vanishing Technique.”</p><p>“If it’s the latter, perhaps there’s still a chance to turn things around?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes narrowed as he pondered over this.</p><p>It could be said that he did not panic to the point of losing his mind after he received this information. This was because the Holy Emperor’s Dragon Scale heart rate had not increased.</p><p>This meant that the threat of the message in his mind was not as great as that of the ‘faceless Saint’.</p><p>Similarly, it meant that there were still many ‘chances to turn things around’ and that death was not a certainty.</p><p>“Atone for his mistake?”</p><p>When he recalled the earlier message, Xu Xiaoshou really couldn’t think of any way to atone for his mistake.</p><p>He couldn’t just return the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer to its original site, right?</p><p>Not only was he reluctant to do so, but Xu Xiaoshou also did not think that this act would ‘make up for one’s mistake with merit’. On the contrary, it was more like something that would provoke the Void Attendant and courted death.</p><p>“Oh right, there seems to be another way to make up for one’s mistakes…”</p><p>Suddenly, he remembered that he had asked the Void Attendant about the use of the Void Crystal. Xu Xiaoshou slapped his thigh and thought of something.</p><p>“Exemption order!”</p><p>The ‘exemption order’ was a resource that could be exchanged in the First Hall of Sins. According to the Void Attendant, it seemed that no matter how serious a crime one committed on the Abyss Island, one could be exempted from death once?</p><p>However, he did not know how many Void Crystals were needed to exchange for this ‘exemption order’.</p><p>“Are you forcing me to make a trip to the First Hall of Sins?”</p><p>“Speaking of which, other than carrying out a Void Attendant’s mission, how else do I obtain Void Crystals?”</p><p>“Damn it! I should have caught an old Spiritual Cultivator and asked him about it. I know too little about the Abyss Island. I’m a little flustered.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind was in a mess, mainly because he felt that he was too ignorant.</p><p>Of course, he was a little afraid.</p><p>However, ever since he had communicated with Water Ghost in the Deep Sea, his mentality had adjusted accordingly.</p><p>Perhaps before becoming a Master Stage, Spiritual Cultivators had to constantly give up certain things in order to survive.</p><p>However, after becoming a Master Stage, there would then be the Sovereign Stage, which would be a step toward the Struggle for the Great Path.</p><p>It was impossible not to shed any blood in the Struggle for the Great Path.</p><p>‘A general’s success was built on ten thousand bones!’</p><p>If he did not have mentality where he had to risk his life for resources, he would probably be surpassed by others very quickly and become a ‘super resource’ in the eyes of other lunatics.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew his worth and was still a little calculative.</p><p>This so-called ‘using his life to fight for opportunities’ was also one of the reasons why he still chose to do so even though he knew that he might face many risks after he emptied the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>“I’ve moved the Herb garden.”</p><p>He didn’t know what would happen next, but he would deal with it as it came.</p><p>The heart of an Expert should be like this!</p><p>“The First Hall of Sins.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind was still on the death countdown as he walked forward.</p><p>It was inevitable that this gave him a lot of pressure.</p><p>“I don’t even know where the First Hall of Sins is now, but I guess it’s not any weaker than the Forest of Miracles. The risk should be higher. After all, the name alone speaks for itself,” he said.</p><p>“Oh, risk?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his chin and pondered.</p><p>At this moment, the information bar jumped.</p><p>Watched, Passive Points +2.</p><p>“Who was it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s scalp went numb, and he immediately focused all his attention on his ‘Perception’, but he could not see anyone around him.</p><p>“Someone is spying on me?”</p><p>“From some unknown place?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s body immediately tensed as if he faced a great enemy. Suddenly, he remembered that he was disguised as the Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi.</p><p>And according to his past experience when faced with a Saint…</p><p>“This generation of ants even dare to spy?”</p><p>He relaxed, put his hands behind his back, looked up at the sky, and sneered. He was like a big boss who didn’t care about the mortals ‘gazes.</p><p>A faint Holy Power fluctuation spread out from his body.</p><p>With a loud boom, the area within a radius of several miles trembled. Ancient trees cracked, the floor split, and even the space began to distort.</p><p>As expected, the tingling feeling quickly disappeared when the Holy Power leaked out. It meant that the cultivation level of the ‘peeper’ was not that of a Demi-Saint and had been scared away by him.</p><p>“Each and every one of you…like a cunning old man!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered in his heart. He still couldn’t find the enemy.</p><p>He couldn’t help but feel that the Abyss Island was really full of crouching tigers and hidden dragons. There were enemies that even his ‘Perception’ couldn’t detect, and every step was dangerous.</p><p>Rumble Rumble Rumble Rumble Rumble.</p><p>Before he could continue to keep up his act, a strange phenomena appeared in the distant sky. A thunderous explosion occurred, and then half of the sky shattered as if it was the end of the world.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
