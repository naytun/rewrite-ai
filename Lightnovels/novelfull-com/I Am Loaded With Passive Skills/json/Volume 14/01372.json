Now, even the gods couldn’t save him!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at the three people in the arena and counted softly, “Three, two, one…Boom!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A deafening sound suddenly erupted in the Forest of Miracles. The ground within a radius of ten thousand miles sank, and the mountains and rivers collapsed. The space above the Nine Heavens was like a mirror that fell apart.</p><p>All of the spiritual cultivators who were still hiding in the forest looked up into the sky, and all of them saw a beam of holy light descending from the sky and landing somewhere far away.</p><p>“Swish-”</p><p>The sound of Taoist music filled the battlefield, and Holy Power surged.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s other hand trembled as he wiped off the stinky blood foam from his face and ears. At this moment, even his pupils were trembling.</p><p>“You, are, seeking, death!”</p><p>With a bang, the Holy Power on his body was no longer suppressed and turned into a soaring Holy Light, shining in the sky.</p><p>The Holy Power gathered and turned into an illusionary giant figure that reached the sky behind him. It was Jiang Buyi himself.</p><p>“Demi-saint’s will!”</p><p>Caught off guard, Rao Yaoyao’s knees hit the ground with a bang. She tried her best to raise her eyes, only to see an illusory, transparent crystal core on the forehead of the illusory giant.</p><p>“A demi-saint person!”</p><p>Her eyes lost focus as she cried out involuntarily, her delicate body beginning to tremble.</p><p>This was a big misunderstanding!</p><p>This was a true demi-saint, definitely not Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>How could Jiang Buyi be pretending when he was so angry that he even showed his demi-saint person?</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>“Demi-saint Jiang, please stop!”</p><p>“Teng Shanhai didn’t do it on purpose. There must be a misunderstanding!”</p><p>Holding Cang Godhood Sword, Rao Yaoyao drew out the power of fate and was barely able to straighten her body in front of the demi-saint’s true body.</p><p>At this moment, she didn’t want to think about anything else. She just wanted the demi-saint to calm down.</p><p>Teng Shanhai should not die. Even if this fellow blasphemed a Saint, he should not die.</p><p>Blasphemy against a Saint…</p><p>A Saint…</p><p>He really deserved to die! What did he just say? If she was a demi-saint, she would kill him too!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao clutched her head, her expression chaotic. She was about to go crazy.</p><p>Initially, she had also thought that the other side was Xu Xiaoshou mocking Teng Shanhai for being so confident. Scolding a Xu Xiaoshou was really nothing.</p><p>However, who would have thought that he was not!</p><p>Since that was not the case, then all of Teng Shanhai’s obscenities just now had been poured onto a demi-saint.</p><p>How could a dignified demi-saint tolerate such blasphemy?</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao, shut up.”</p><p>Without turning his head, Jiang Buyi stared at his hand, which he had pierced through Teng Shanhai’s chest. He could feel Teng Shanhai’s body trembling under the pressure of the Holy Power, unable to even say a word.</p><p>At this moment, there was only killing intent left in his eyes.</p><p>“Demi-saint Jiang, I apologize to you on behalf of Teng Shanhai. You can’t kill him. There must be a misunderstanding. Give him a chance and I’ll owe you a favor. Can you do that?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s brain worked quickly, and her eyes lit up as she added, “That’s right, Xu Xiaoshou! He was definitely the one behind this! Teng Shanhai can’t be sure that you’re Xu Xiaoshou for no reason. He has his own reasons to make a fuss.”</p><p>“I don’t care what reason he has!” Jiang Buyi turned around and roared. He could no longer maintain his gentle and elegant demeanor because his left hand dug out a lump of sticky blood foam from his ear.</p><p>“He…”</p><p>“He…”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s left hand trembled and he could not continue.</p><p>This was too humiliating!</p><p>As a dignified demi-saint, how could he, Jiang Buyi, stay in the demi-saint circle in the future if he was scolded by a junior with the dirtiest words and had stinky saliva shot on his face and even got into his ears?</p><p>Holding the Cang Godhood Sword, Rao Yaoyao slowly approached him, her pretty face grave. “Jiang Buyi, you must never, ever kill him.”</p><p>“Even you are going to attack me?” Jiang Buyi shouted fiercely. Without waiting for Rao Yaoyao to come close, his dirty and messy left hand guided, and the Saint Statue condensed by the demi-saint’s will behind him burst out with surging Holy Power.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao could not even resist. Cang Godhood Sword left her hand and fell into Jiang Buyi’s palm.</p><p>“Get lost!!!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi seemed to have gone a little crazy. He did not care who was behind Rao Yaoyao and did not fear the crazy struggle of the Cang Godhood Sword in his hand.</p><p>With a tap.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>The divine sword Xuan Cang turned into a stream of light and ruthlessly pierced into Rao Yaoyao’s chest, nailing her body to the barrier of the holy region a hundred miles away.</p><p>“Swish-”</p><p>“Pfft!” Rao Yaoyao spat out a mouthful of blood, her beautiful eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p>Not only did Jiang Buyi really want to attack, but he had also injured her?</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao…”</p><p>The trembling Jiang Buyi slapped away the person who was in his way and raised Teng Shanhai up high. His voice was filled with iciness as if it had pierced through the Nine Serenities hell.</p><p>“I don’t want to kill you, but that doesn’t mean you can blaspheme a Saint.”</p><p>“Today, I will not only kill Teng Shanhai, but I will also take his head and personally visit the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe. I will question Dao Qiongcang, why has he trained such a person!”</p><p>Teng Shanhai struggled with all his might. His single eye was filled with fear.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>How could Xu xiaoshou be so powerful?</p><p>“Watch carefully!” Jiang Buyi said coldly. Without further ado, he used his right hand that was pierced through Teng Shanhai’s chest to cut through his entire body.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>The world fell silent.</p><p>Flesh and blood, as well as the fragments of the Cang God Armor, scattered into the sky. It was a shocking sight.</p><p>The abstract fear was almost tangible, magnified in the eyes of Rao Yaoyao, who was nailed to the wall of the holy realm, and also reflected in the pupils of Xu Xiaoshou, who was in his disappearing state.</p><p>Teng Shanhai was split into two!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
