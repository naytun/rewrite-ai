He had thousands of words to say, but he only said one in the end.</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>Is Jiang Buyi dead?</p><p>Master Siren killed a demi-saint with one sword?</p><p>He was dead, right? Then, he remembered that when he killed the Yi, he first destroyed the physical body, then their souls.</p><p>The difference between Master Siren’s “Soul Controlling” and “Disillusionment Finger” tricks was that the latter could silently destroy a person’s soul. But, conversely, the former could bring more pain to the enemy!</p><p>Even his soul body had been eaten. So what could Jiang Buyi use to resurrect?</p><p>Even so, Xu Xiaoshou still could not believe it.</p><p>If it was already difficult to reach the Sovereign Dao Realm, getting to the Cutting Path Stage and the Higher Void Level was even more challenging.</p><p>It was reasonable to say that a demi-saint could not be so dismissive. Or was it not Jiang Buyi who was dismissive, but Master Siren’s position that could not be measured by ordinary higher void level or ordinary demi-saints?</p><p>In Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes, the Mei Siren was no longer part of the higher void level.</p><p>This was the demi-saint Iron Wolf in the sheepskin of a Sword Deity. Other than looking harmless, it was more terrifying than anything he had ever seen when it was angry!</p><p>Just as the onlookers were still immersed in the shock of Mei Siren killing the demi-saint Jiang Buyi with a single sword, suddenly, thunderclouds gathered in the Nine Heavens. An angry roar resounded through the entire Forest of Miracles.</p><p>“Mei! Si! Ren!”</p><p>It was Jiang Buyi’s voice!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked up in shock and saw the outline of the thundercloud in the void. It turned into the face of Jiang Buyi, twisting and changing in the endless clouds of flames.</p><p>“As expected, you’re not dead.”</p><p>“I knew it! A demi-saint won’t die so quickly!”</p><p>However, a hundred ghosts have completely devoured his soul, and the nine-arrow sword has also shattered his physical body. So how could he still be alive?</p><p>“By sheer will?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of the battle against Yi the other day. His body had been destroyed, but his soul was still there. His soul had been destroyed, but his will was still there. His face immediately darkened.</p><p>However, completely different from Yi, Jiang Buyi’s will, which had turned into thunderclouds in the sky, did not seem to be without the power to fight. On the contrary, the thundercloud about to blow up the entire Forest of Miracles was more like a big move brewing for a long time, no weaker than the sum of all the Saint Martial Arts he had released.</p><p>“Sigh…”</p><p>Mei Siren also looked up and sighed for a long time.</p><p>He had expected all of this, but he still could not help but sigh when it happened.</p><p>He wished that he had just destroyed the demi-saint incarnation of Jiang Buyi.</p><p>For a demi-saint to grow to this level and be suppressed by the Holy Divine Palace, it was reasonable to say that his true body would only be in a corner and would not appear randomly.</p><p>This was because they were more afraid of accidents than anyone else. What they were most fearful of was naturally “man-made” accidents.</p><p>Whether it was from the various dark powers on the continent or because of someone’s trap, his semi-saint status was recovered.</p><p>Therefore, Mei Siren guessed that Jiang Buyi’s true body would not come to Abyss Island, which was dangerous!</p><p>If it were only the incarnation of a demi-saint, his sword attack just now would have sealed all his escape routes.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s demi-saint incarnation could not even send a single message back to his main body before he died.</p><p>Even if it could be transmitted, it was still an Abyss Island away. Whether the news could be sent back to the main body of the Shengshen Continent was another matter entirely.</p><p>However, Mei Siren had never thought that Jiang Buyi would be so daring!</p><p>He did not come to Abyss Island in his demi-saint incarnation but in his true body!</p><p>The combat strength of the demi-saint’s true body and the incarnation was not much different. The only thing affected was external: the demi-saint’s incarnation might not carry as many life-saving objects as the true body.</p><p>However, in addition to their combat strength, the essential difference between the two was that if the demi-saint’s incarnation died, it would be an actual death.</p><p>However, if a demi-saint’s true body accidentally died, all the damage would be transferred to its incarnation before death, saving the life of the true body.</p><p>Why were demi-saints so powerful?</p><p>It was not only because they had interacted with the Holy Path but also because they could condense the demi-saint incarnation.</p><p>Why was the demi-saint’s incarnation so powerful?</p><p>This was because they could inherit 100% of the power of the real body, and as long as they had a demi-saint’s incarnation, the demi-saint himself would have an extra life. So three corpses meant three more lives!</p><p>Mei Siren was puzzled.</p><p>He had thought that the situation would not be so bad. He did not expect Jiang Buyi’s real body to dare to come to Abyss Island. So what was he up to?</p><p>Was it to take Xu Xiaoshou’s life?</p><p>Was he crazy? Xu Xiaoshou was just a junior. How could he have provoked the true body of a demi-saint to come and kill him?</p><p>But what else could he be after other than Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>The Jiang Clan of the Northern Region…</p><p>That’s right, with that past reason, he was after Lei’s Family Eyes?</p><p>However, how did Lei’s Family Eyes end up on Abyss Island? Could it be that Jiang Buyi was tricked into Abyss Island?</p><p>“I’m tired…”</p><p>Mei Siren did not want to fight anymore.</p><p>He was very clear about his condition. He only looked impressive, but the sword had consumed too much of his energy.</p><p>He was like an old adult who had not exercised for decades and suddenly became young and hot-blooded again and ran five laps around the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>After the run, he was both mentally and physically exhausted.</p><p>“Fighting is not my speciality. I want to be a teacher who doesn’t need to exercise,” Mei Siren thought, looking at the calamity clouds of thunder and fire above Nine Heavens. Nonetheless, he could not show it, which made him even more helpless.</p><p>“Stop, Jiang Buyi.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
