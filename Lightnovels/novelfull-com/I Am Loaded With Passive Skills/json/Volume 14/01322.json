His voice buzzed and roared like thunder. “Another reckless invader.”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Hong Dang’s hand tightened and his heart jumped. He almost crushed the Miracle Fruit instantly.</p><p>“This?”</p><p>“This!”</p><p>“What the hell is this?!”</p><p>He tried his best to look around and carefully discern the situation.</p><p>Finally, he saw that the Black Mountain was actually an ancient Giant that was three thousand feet in size. Hong Dang’s pupils constricted, and his mind exploded on the spot.</p><p>“Damn…damn…damn!”</p><p>“Double Dumba*s, come out and explain this to me!”</p><p>“Guardian? Giant? You call this a thirty feet Giant?”</p><p>“A Sovereign Physique? This is what you meant when you said it was a match for a Sovereign Physique? What the hell is this creature?”</p><p>With a bang, the ground under his feet exploded, and soil flew everywhere.</p><p>Hong Dang didn’t dare to waste even a second. Holding the Holy Miracle Fruit which was the size of a human head, he ran as fast as he could.</p><p>As he ran towards the exit of the barrier, Hong Dang was still roaring in a deranged manner.</p><p>“You bloody idiotic Double Dumba*s, curses on your father!”</p><p>“I curse all eighteen generations of your clan to die a terrible death!”</p><p>“Giant, you damned scammer, you tricked me! You animal!”</p><p>His voice sounded tearful.</p><p>At this moment, in his frenzy, he recalled all the details that he had overlooked previously.</p><p>“Why did the Double Dumba*s still charge forward after breaking the Barrier? if so, what was the point of him looking for a partner outside the Barrier?”</p><p>“The Double Dumba”s was clearly at the Higher Void level, so why was he the one who struck first, yet was still slower than him? He had been the first to enter the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, so what was he waiting for?”</p><p>“The Double Dumba*s had entered the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer and disappeared without a trace. What was he afraid of?”</p><p>Giant!</p><p>The answer was the 3000-feet-tall dark Giant above them!</p><p>Hong Dang went crazy.</p><p>His hysterical vulgarities accompanied his figure as he dashed out of the Barrier channel like a bereaved dog. His voice echoed around every corner outside the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>Man would die for the sake of wealth.</p><p>Hong Dang had thought that the Double Dumba*s would trick him, so he had been prepared for the possibility that what the other party had said wasn’t entirely true.</p><p>But he didn’t expect that the Double Dumba*s would trick him so thoroughly!</p><p>With such a huge Giant as the Guardian, how did the Double Dumba*s still dare to attack? Did he have the guts to go to the Heavens?</p><p>“How dare he!”</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>“I can only run!”</p><p>“Prepare? What preparations? A mantis trying to stop a chariot is like an ant trying to shake a tree. All our preparations were merely toys in front of this Giant!”</p><p>Hong Dang cursed with all his might and ran at full speed.</p><p>The most important thing now was to save the Holy Miracle Fruit and survive this ordeal.</p><p>As for the Double Dumba*s…</p><p>He would settle the score after autumn!</p><p>Outside, on an ancient tree.</p><p>Hearing the ferocious curses and seeing a mad dog rushing out of the Barrier, Lei Xi-er took a deep breath and remained silent.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you’re really ruthless!”</p><p>“Sacrifice yourself instead.”</p><p>Just by thinking about it, Lei Xi ‘er knew how desperate Hong Dang must have been when he saw a dark Giant outlined against the sky after plucking the Holy Medicine.</p><p>She half-squatted on the crown of the ancient tree, held the two small front paws of Greedy the Cat Spirit with both hands and pinched them as she said in a low voice, “Greedy the Cat Spirit.”</p><p>“Meow…”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit looked up, confused.</p><p>Lei Xi-er’s red lips pouted. After a long time, she sighed, “In the future, don’t cast your Three Loathsome Eyes at Xu Xiaoshou, understand?”</p><p>“Purr?”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit tilted its head. “Why?”</p><p>Lei Xi-er was speechless.</p><p>“Just look at your innocent manner…”.</p><p>“Greedy the Cat Spirit, do you know that if one day Xu Xiaoshou should devour you until not even a strand of cat hair is left, you will still be happy before your death!”</p><p>“It’s nothing,”</p><p>However, after a pause, Lei Xi-er no longer said anything. “Hide. Don’t let the Void Attendant discover our presence.”</p><p>As an outsider, even if she couldn’t see what was happening in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, Lei Xi-er was smart, so how could she not figure out what the situation inside was like?</p><p>The Void Attendant didn’t react to the destruction of the Barrier of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>As soon as Hong Dang took the Medicine and started cursing, the Void Attendant responded.</p><p>Without a doubt, Xu Xiaoshou had disappeared and left Hong Dang to bear the wrath of the Void Attendant on his own.</p><p>According to the circumstances…</p><p>The Barrier of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer was not important!</p><p>The Void Attendant was there to protect the Spiritual and Holy Medicine.</p><p>Therefore, the best way for Hong Dang to save his life was not to run, but to put down the Holy Miracle Fruit. He could even throw it on the ground.</p><p>Perhaps, the Void Attendant would not pursue him anymore.</p><p>But…</p><p>“Is that possible?”</p><p>The scene of the Double Dumba*s tragic death flashed through Lei Xi’er’s mind.</p><p>She had not seen Double Dumba*s swallowing the Medicine, but based on her last glimpse of him, the fragrance of the Holy Medicine that emanated from his body, and the circumstances whereby he at the Higher Void level had mastered the Holy Power…</p><p>No one could let go of the Holy Miracle Fruit!</p><p>Since the treasure was already in his hands, it was only logical for all the herb harvesters to put down the Holy Medicine and become ‘Buddha on the spot’, as in to let go immediately.</p><p>However, everyone had this ‘fluke’ mentality.</p><p>“What if?”</p><p>“What if I can escape the pursuit of the Void Attendant?”</p><p>“Then wouldn’t it be a huge loss and an extreme stupidity for me to let go of the Holy Miracle Fruit that I risked my life to obtain?”</p><p>“Greed…”</p><p>Lei Xi-er muttered to herself.</p><p>“Greed, the original sin!”</p><p>“But when it came to ‘greed’ who could be more greedy than Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Others would run away after picking a Holy Medicine, but Xu Xiaoshou, who had experienced the Void Attendant’s Combat Strength, still had his eyes on the entire Herb Garden of Divine Farmer. The entire Garden!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
