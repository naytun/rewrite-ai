He felt that at this stage, only Bazhun’an, who was still at the Master Stage a few decades ago, could challenge him to a fight.</p><p>But with the Holy Power, it was a different story.</p><p>This was the real Demi-Saint below the Master Stage!</p><p>Bazhun’an at the Master Stage level?</p><p>He was just a toy!</p><p>With a single thought, he activated his Holy Power.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened his eyes and a sharp light flashed in them.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>In the Yuan Mansion, a majestic pressure descended from the sky.</p><p>At this moment, the wind blew, the Spiritual Medicine bent, the poisonous fish hid, and the sand and stones trembled.</p><p>Even Ice and Ember, who were in the neighboring space, sensed something and growled softly.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>It was a level of power that could suppress anyone and any creature below the Demi- Saint level.</p><p>Ice and Ember looked around in shock and fear. Finally, their eyes locked on Xu Xiaoshou in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>“Wuwuwu?”</p><p>Ember struggled to straighten his body and scratched his head curiously.</p><p>“Wasn’t this the ability of the guy I killed before? My owner has it too?”</p><p>“And looking at this pressure, it seemed to be more powerful than those so-called assassins?”</p><p>“Can this even be compared?”</p><p>Feeling Ember’s thoughts, Xu Xiaoshou laughed.</p><p>He had swallowed one hundred percent of the Holy Miracle Fruit, while the Double Dumba*s had wasted ninety-nine percent of their power!</p><p>The initial Holy Power energy that the two of them had been waiting for was not on the same level at all!</p><p>Xu Xaoshou had never specifically suppressed this pressure on a specific person. Otherwise, even a giant like Ember would have to kneel down if he was caught off guard.</p><p>“it’s quite strong, but it can’t compare to the Holy Blood for now.”</p><p>Clenching his fist and feeling the Attribute of the Holy Power, Xu Xiaoshou came to a preliminary conclusion.</p><p>The Holy Blood was the pure power extracted from a mature Demi-Saint. Generally, those who took it might also have a Saint Statue.</p><p>However, the accompanying Holy Power of the Holy Miracle Fruit was only brought by a small Holy Medicine. It was at the Innate Stage which was weaker than a real Demi-Saint, so how could it be compared?</p><p>Of course, it was not fair to compare the Holy Power of the Holy Miracle Fruit with the Holy Blood of a real Demi-Saint.</p><p>You can’t become a Demi-Saint even after eating 100 Holy Miracle Fruits. How can you compare the Holy Power of one of these fruits with the Holy Blood of a Demi-Saint?</p><p>This was not a joke!</p><p>The Holy Power of the Holy Miracle Fruit was originally used to show off one’s superiority to those below the Demi-Saint level!</p><p>“Hehe, I’m so strong.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought and laughed.</p><p>He did not value the power of his own Holy Power at the current stage, although it was still Holy Power after all, and should not be underestimated.</p><p>But what he was really interested in was the growth of the Holy Power of the Holy Miracle Fruit.</p><p>“It’s just as I thought. After becoming a part of my body, not only can the Holy Power of the Holy Miracle Fruit grow on its own, but it can also be affected by passive skills which speeds up its self-cultivation!”</p><p>He looked at the Holy Power in his Energy Reserve, which constantly drew power and accelerated its growth from ‘High Spirits’,’ Eternal Vitality’, and his own qi and blood due to the existence of ‘Transformation’.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that the Cutting Path Stage and Higher Void level cultivators on the Abyss Island were finished.</p><p>“How could it take months or even years to reach the peak of power after consuming the Holy Blood?”</p><p>He had so many passive skills, and with ‘Transformation’ as the medium, this Holy Power could grow, split, and grow to a terrifying level in a few days, right?”</p><p>If you still think it’s too slow…</p><p>One had to consciously consume the Holy Medicine. Even if it was a waste of the medicinal power, one had to maintain their consciousness and then use ‘Transformation’ to transfer all the energy to the Holy Power.</p><p>“Ha..ha..ha…ha…”</p><p>Xu Xiao Shou laughed in an abnormal manner.</p><p>He was sure that if he really did this, he would be able to create the number one Master Stage Demi-Saint in a few hours. He would be able to consume Holy Blood all the time and be in peak condition without any side effects!</p><p>Xu XiaoShou?</p><p>No, no, no, no, my name is Xu Mengshou!</p><p>Cutting Path Stage?</p><p>Higher Void level?</p><p>It’s a different story if you have the Holy Blood, but if you have the Saint Statue, please take another path.</p><p>But if you don’t have…</p><p>I’m sorry, if you meet me in the future, take a detour, okay?</p><p>Otherwise…</p><p>All of them were toys!</p><p>In the end, all of them would die!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly stood up, flicked his sleeves, and stuck out his chest. “What I’m fighting for is the suppression of resources!”</p><p>In the next second, Xu Xiaoshou, who had forgotten to keep a distance between his clothes and his sensitive muscles due to his pride, suddenly fell from the air.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>“Er…er…er…er…”</p><p>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I was wrong, I know I was wrong.”</p><p>“So, are there any Elixirs that can heal sensitive muscles? Waiting online, very urgent! It’s very urgent!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
