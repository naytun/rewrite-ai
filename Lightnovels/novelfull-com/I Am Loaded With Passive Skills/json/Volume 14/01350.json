He will still be able to find me eventually; it’ll just take some time.”</p><p>“This should be the reason why even though the enemy this time is the Void Attendant, who is not inferior to the Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi, the heartbeat of the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale is not as rapid as it would have been, had I been at the point of a certain death.”</p><p>“This is because the Void Attendant is rather stupid!”</p><p>The more he thought about it, the more excited Xu Xiaoshou became. He was not afraid of a strong opponent, but he was afraid that a strong opponent would be intelligent as well.</p><p>In that case, he would have to spend more effort to make the other party fall into his trap.</p><p>The Void Attendant was obviously an easy target!</p><p>“I’m the assassin who emptied the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, but the Void Attendant has not seen my face. Even if it did, the face of the medicine thief might have been disguised, and there’s no way to verify it.”</p><p>“But if it were to locate me by my smell…”</p><p>“In other words, no matter whose face I use to return to the Abyss Island with, whoever it is, will be the real culprit who emptied the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at the Spatial passageway in front of him and a sinister grin stretched across his face and almost reached his temples.</p><p>He felt like he had received an invitation from the Grim Reaper.</p><p>If you want someone to die, just write their name and hand it over to the Spatial passageway.</p><p>In the middle of the night, when the Grim Reaper knocked on the door, people would undoubtedly die!</p><p>“Damn, I’m too sinister, hehe.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held his head in disbelief. Even he was completely shocked by his own thoughts.</p><p>“How could there be such a sly old man in this world?”</p><p>“How did I become like this?”</p><p>“This is too evil, it must be Hidden Bitter’s fault. I’ve also been influenced by it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and gasped for breath. He finally calmed down.</p><p>Half of his Foot Stomp was in the Spatial passageway that connected the Yuan Mansion and the Abyss Island. He could hear the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale’s heartbeat’s increased acceleration and he felt an adrenaline rush.</p><p>This was simply too exciting!</p><p>“But here’s the problem…”</p><p>“Now, who do I wish to send to his death?”</p><p>Gripping the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale tightly, Xu Xiaoshou’s heart began to beat at the same frequency as the Scale’s. It made his body heat up and his mind spin.</p><p>“Elder Sang? Bazhun’an? Water Ghost?”</p><p>“No, no, no. It’s too small. The scale is too small. These are all characters who can personally take revenge when they mature. ”</p><p>“Yu Lingdi? Rao Yaoyao? Ye Xiao?”</p><p>“No, no. They may have committed grave sins, but it’s not to the point where we need to waste the only strike of a powerful executioner like the Void Attendant to kill them.”</p><p>“Then, who else is there?”</p><p>The faces of his enemies flashed through his mind. Xu Xiaoshou shifted through the images, one by one and pondered on his decision.</p><p>From the memories of the Double Dumba*s, the Void Attendant could even devour the Holy Power. it was simply invincible on the Abyss Island.</p><p>it would be a waste to use such a powerful helper to fight against the Higher Void level.</p><p>Then, there was only one candidate left.</p><p>“Swish.”</p><p>His thoughts stopped.</p><p>The face that made the Holy Emperor’s Dragon Scale jump in the most rapid way that he had ever seen in the Deep Sea was fixed in his mind.</p><p>He had a compassionate face, white hair, and was surrounded by clouds. He was invincible.</p><p>The Demi-Saint, Jiang Buyi!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had a perverted smile on his face.</p><p>He did not even need to use the Imitator. With his ‘Transformation’, his height, body shape, and face resembled the Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi to a tee.</p><p>He then changed his clothes. It didn’t need to be exactly the same, a simple white robe would do.</p><p>With a thought, the non-attribute white Holy Power in his Energy Reserve bloomed, and white mist appeared all over his body, like the power of the cloud attribute.</p><p>Appearance, Holy Power, temperament, and aura.</p><p>Except for the soul that did not bear the surname of Jiang, Xu Xiaoshou dared to guarantee that at this moment, when Jiang Xian came to see him and felt the clear and visible Holy Power, he would immediately kneel down and call him ‘Great-grandfather’!</p><p>‘Jiang Buyi’ made his appearance.</p><p>He turned around and glanced at the Collapsed Tower. The Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi stroked his beard and smiled. He did not linger and with a Foot Stomp entered the Spatial passageway.</p><p>“Little Junior Sister, when this Saint returns, I’ll give you a big surprise!”</p><p>“Oh, maybe it might be a scare…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
