It was not something that one realm could resist, nor could one person resist the power of thousands.</p><p>“The stars represent the unknown…”</p><p>“This means that even if I cultivate the Energy Reserve into a Bounded Domain or the Higher Void World, I’ll still only walk on one of the paths of Saints, the Way of Spiritual Cultivation.”</p><p>“And those stars that represent the unknown are another path, the cultivation path leading to the Demi-Saint and the Holy Emperor?”</p><p>The more Xu Xiaoshou thought about it, the more he felt that the Way of the Heavens was broad and profound.</p><p>With the tens of thousands of Spirit Cultivators on the Shengshen Continent as the foundation, and at the cost of countless years, the world had finally managed to figure out how to refine the Spiritual Cultivation in the era before the decline of the Way of the Sword.</p><p>This could be used to become a path of a Saint, and it was closer to the trend of the times, so it could become the mainstream.</p><p>However, this was only one path. Just because no one in the world had found another path, it didn’t mean that it didn’t exist.</p><p>The thousands of Great Paths would be there forever, waiting quietly.</p><p>They were just waiting for a genius from a certain era to unearth them and reveal them to the public.</p><p>This other Path was a star in the sea of Energy Reserve. If it surpassed the Way of Spiritual Cultivation, the next era might arrive soon!</p><p>“But it’s too difficult.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and sighed.</p><p>Why else would the unknown be greatly feared?</p><p>What was even more terrifying than this was that what he knew was minimal when he saw the sea of stars and the vastness of the universe just as he stepped into the threshold. When he realized that he would never be able to reach this realm in his life, he felt depressed.</p><p>‘When one understood the path in the morning, it was fine to die in the evening.’</p><p>In a dazed state, Xu Xiaoshou seemed to understand why there was such a phrase.</p><p>He looked at the stars in his Energy Reserve and realized that they were great ways to the Great Paths of the Saints. They were not weaker than the Way of the Sword or the way of Spiritual Cultivation. He then realized how insignificant he was.</p><p>‘Sending mayflies to the heavens and earth, it is merely a drop in the ocean.’</p><p>There was a limit to one’s strength, and geniuses like Bazhun’an who could reach the peak of the Way of the Sword and the Way of Spiritual Cultivation were already very rare.</p><p>Find another path and create… No! How could one person find another path to become a Saint?</p><p>After one had survived an era, they might be able to succeed!</p><p>‘I mourn the fleeting moment of my life, and envy the infinity of the Yangtze River. I know these things cannot be obtained suddenly, the sad wind sounds…’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and sighed with emotion. He was not moved by ‘Infinity’ and ‘Future’, and he quickly recollected himself and calmed down.</p><p>‘3000 weak water, but only one scoop is enough.’ There are many beautiful things in life, but to hold on to one of them is enough.</p><p>Since he could attain the Saint realm by using both the Way of Spiritual Cultivation and the Way of the Sword, he just had to focus on one of them.</p><p>To be able to attain these two realms, he had to be a genius that surpassed an entire era.</p><p>He wasn’t one of those inflexible academics. Why would he waste his time on meaningless stuff to discover another path for others?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou admired these people.</p><p>However, he knew that he could not become such a person.</p><p>Therefore, he decided to freely walk the path left by his predecessors. If he could master it, he would find another way, which was appropriate for him.</p><p>“I’m already at the Star Worship State without my knowledge.”</p><p>“Breakthroughs are like flowing water, it happens inadvertently.”</p><p>After he collected his thoughts, Xu Xiaoshou felt slightly inspired.</p><p>From the Master Stage Heavenly Image State to the Master Stage Star Worship State, he was only one realm away from the Sovereign Dao realm. This speed was indeed fast.</p><p>Of course, he couldn’t be compared to a freak like Lei Xi-er.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was quite satisfied with the breakthrough of his current realm.</p><p>However, even though he was satisfied, he still couldn’t help but feel puzzled.</p><p>“That’s not right. Even in the ancient times, the Holy Miracle Fruit was a treasure that only people of the Higher Void level could enjoy.”</p><p>“After being used by a mere Master Stage, why did he only manage to break through two Sub-levels?”</p><p>“Moreover, the Star Worship Stage hasn’t reached its Final Stage yet. It’s only the beginning?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at his Energy Reserve again.</p><p>His Energy Reserve surged continuously.</p><p>It looked extraordinary, but it was only a thin layer of water at the foundation of the widened basin. There was still a long way to go before it was full.</p><p>This preliminary judgment was that he was only at the Early Stage of the Star Worship State, which was a huge gap from the Final-Stage of the Star Worship State that Xu Xiaoshou had expected.</p><p>“Is it because my Energy Reserve is too big and the Holy Miracle Fruit can’t fill me up?”</p><p>“It’s not to the extent of being awkward.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head.</p><p>“Even for Sovereign Dao Realm, the Holy Medicine could bring about a qualitative leap, not to mention a Master Stage Sub-level.”</p><p>“The Holy Miracle Fruit must have other powers. Someone must have secretly eaten it!”</p><p>It looked like he broke through from Heavenly Image State to the Star Worship State, but it was actually just from the peak of Heavenly Image State to the Early Stage of Star Worship State. How could the energy of the Holy Miracle Fruit only fill up the Yin Yang State?”</p><p>“So, there’s a thief in my body!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickly locked onto his target and viciously sized up the treasures above his Energy Reserve.</p><p>There were too many thieves in his Energy Reserve such as the Infernal Original Seed, the Three Days Frozen Calamity, the Little Blue Flower of the Tranquil Lake, his own Sword Cognition, his uncle’s Sword Cognition and the White Light Bead from the Wretched Saint who had been shifted above his Energy Reserve…</p><p>It was fine to steal some power from the Holy Medicine!</p><p>But if you steal it, you have to give me some feedback, or I’ll kill you!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked around at all the treasures that he was familiar with before, and his attention was quickly attracted to a source of Saint power.</p><p>“Holy Power!”</p><p>His eyebrows shot up and he was overjoyed.</p><p>This wisp of Holy Power was brought by the Holy Miracle Fruit, and it appeared in his Energy Reserve as expected.</p><p>“Come on, let’s do a test first!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
