A New Storm Had Appeared… 2</p><p>“Hehehe…”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s teeth chattered.</p><p>It wasn’t due to fear, but excitement.</p><p>“Was he really a Demon God?”</p><p>“Were all the legends true?”</p><p>The Demon God’s corpse had been found by him in the cave in the Sleeping Valley. The door didn’t even have a seal and it was so easy for him to enter?</p><p>“Could it be that my true destiny was not to meet Teacher and become an Ancient Swordsman, but to obtain the Demon God’s legacy at this very moment?” Xiao Kongtong was slightly excited.</p><p>The Giant’s corpse was very valuable, but he had no intention of desecrating it.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong didn’t even want to pry open the Demon God’s hand and snatch away the great spear.</p><p>After all, he was a Swordsman, not a Spear Demon. He wasn’t interested in any weapons other than swords.</p><p>However…</p><p>There was something else on the Demon God’s body that made Xiao Kongtong envious.</p><p>There was a very eye-catching black necklace around the neck of the Demon God who sat on the throne. Each of the clasps was very big, bigger than a normal human body.</p><p>However, the crystal-like gemstone at the core of the necklace was only the size of a normal human fist.</p><p>“Holy Power!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was moved.</p><p>The crystal gemstone, which was the size of a fist, emitted strong waves of Holy Power. It looked like the core of a Demi-Saint.</p><p>“It can’t be! It can’t be!”</p><p>He glanced at it, then looked again and again…</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s expression turned a little crazed. In the end, he scratched his head in disbelief.</p><p>“Semi-Saint Person! ! !”</p><p>“There’s a Semi-Saint Person in this crappy place!”</p><p>“How was that possible? Didn’t they say that the Void Island was passed down from ancient times? Did the Semi-Saint Person exist at that time?”</p><p>“Or could it be that the Demi-Saint level was just a title used in ancient times during the period of Spiritual Cultivation, and the Semi-Saint Person is just a title that fits the current era?”</p><p>No matter what.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong believed that he was not wrong about the Semi-Saint Person on the Demon God’s pendant.</p><p>He had been in Fringe Moon Immortal City for more than 30 years. Even if he used all the power of the Ancient Swordsman that he had cultivated with his faction, he could not find any Semi-Saint Person that had been lost in Shengshen continent.</p><p>Now, he had come across a cave?</p><p>“I can’t take it, I can’t take it, I absolutely can’t take it!”</p><p>“Xiao Kongtong, don’t be silly. Think about the Sleeping Valley, the half-closed door, and the legend of the Demon God…”</p><p>“There’s not even a seal here, what are you? You’re not the Lord of the Abyss Island, and you’re not the Lord of the Black and White Veins. What right do you have to get the Semi-Saint Person rank without any effort?”</p><p>“This is a trap!”</p><p>The persuasive little man in Xiao Kongtong’s mind stood up again.</p><p>But in the next second, he was stabbed to death by the evil little man.</p><p>“I am the eldest Senior Brother of Fringe Moon Immortal City. Who in the world can stop me?”</p><p>“In the Way of the Sword, we must advance courageously. Swordsmen of our generation must be resolute and sharp!”</p><p>“God does not take, but bears the blame instead!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>This sonorous and powerful declaration made Xiao Kongtong’s blood boil with excitement.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong jumped onto the Sword of the Space and flew up to the huge Demon God’s corpse. Under the gaze of the Demon God’s closed eyes, he wasn’t even sure if he was watching…</p><p>“Sorry!”</p><p>He reached out his hand.</p><p>He held the crystal gem.</p><p>“Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom…”</p><p>In the next second, a shocking explosion came from outside the cave. The sound was as loud as thunder, as if the end of the world had arrived and the sky was about to fall.</p><p>“Damn, damn, damn!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong had only grabbed the crystal gem with the ‘Semi Saint Person’, in less than half a breath. His expression changed drastically, as if he was holding the scythe of death. He was so scared that he threw the gem into the sky.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I really didn’t do it on purpose. I was just curious. I was curious about what this gem looked like. I’ll put it back for you right now, Senior.”</p><p>“Return it to the original owner, return it to the original owner. Don’t hurt anyone, don’t hurt anyone…”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was trembling as he tried to put the crystal gemstone on the necklace, but he accidentally touched the clasp on the side.</p><p>The clasp, which was thicker than a human being, turned into dust with a sizzle…</p><p>It turned…</p><p>Into dust…</p><p>Xiao Kongtong: “? ? ?”</p><p>“Without the clasp, how can I put the gemstone back? How can I put it on your heart?”</p><p>“Rumble, Rumble, Rumble, Rumble…”</p><p>Outside the cave, the rumbling noise suddenly became louder. It was as if the Giant’s footsteps was approaching the area.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I really didn’t mean to break your necklace!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong wanted to cry, but he had no tears. He looked up at the tightly shut eyes of the Demon God Giant, afraid that in the next second, those eyes would open and the Demon Good would wake up.</p><p>Fortunately, things had not come to this point.</p><p>The Demon God did not wake up.</p><p>“Die, die, die, die…”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong did not dare to delay any longer.</p><p>The clasp was not there, but the Demon God’s body was still in front of him.</p><p>“I’ll give you the Semi-Saint Person back to you. Without the clasp, I can stuff it into your nostrils, right?”</p><p>Although the Demon God’s nostrils were very big, he might not be able to wedge such a small gemstone inside.</p><p>However, the seven orifices of a person were connected. Xiao Kongtong aimed and threw the crystal gemstone through his nostrils into the Demon God.</p><p>“Sizzle”</p><p>As a result, when the gemstone touched the Demon God, the Demon God turned into ashes and disintegrated too.</p><p>The Demon God’s spear that pierced through the sky did not disintegrate. It tilted and smashed downward toward Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>“Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom…”</p><p>The footsteps outside the cave seemed to be extremely furious. It struck fear into Xiao Kongtong’s heart and his face turned pale with fright.</p><p>“Don’t trick me!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong almost burst into tears.</p><p>“So the power of the Semi-Saint Person was used to preserve the Demon God’s corpse?”</p><p>His one move reduced the corpse to dust. Even if he didn’t mean to steal the treasure, it would be the end!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
