Her blood energy was drawn away, and her mood became even more irritable. Her entire body was covered in a layer of darkness.</p><p>It was as if the entire world was going against her!</p><p>“I can’t stay here any longer…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s heart tightened slightly as she estimated her own condition. She felt that in the time less than it would take to brew a cup of tea, the spiritual source in her energy reserve as well as her own blood energy would be completely sucked dry by the Forest of Miracles.</p><p>By then, even if she was physically weak, she would still be able to control Cang Godhood Sword. However, as long as she could not walk out of this place, the Forest of Miracles would continue to wear her down and exhaust her to death!</p><p>“Jiang Buyi, you are not leaving?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao discreetly glanced at Jiang Buyi, who was still in the Holy Realm. Seeing that his eyes were still on her, she could only helplessly choose to stay away.</p><p>Even a demi-saint could not withstand the nine deathtraps that had awakened. Jiang Buyi must leave.</p><p>However, it seemed that he was watching her leave because he didn’t want her to find out why he was still there.</p><p>Unfortunately…</p><p>Rao Yaoyao knew all this, but she couldn’t force herself to stop and wait.</p><p>First, she could not wait.</p><p>Second, Jiang Buyi would not let her do as she wished.</p><p>“What a failure…”</p><p>With a bitter smile, Rao Yaoyao looked up at the sky and laughed at herself.</p><p>The broken sky was just like her current state of mind. She had achieved nothing ever since she took control of the situation. Yi had died, and now she could not even save Teng Shanhai.</p><p>“I, what have I done?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao felt her heart aching.</p><p>Gou Wuyue was all alone, but he could take down a Saint Servant, Sleeveless.</p><p>What about her?</p><p>What did she do?</p><p>Nothing!</p><p>Yi’s death and Teng Shanhai’s death were all linked to the name “Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou”. However, Rao Yaoyao couldn’t figure out how Xu Xiaoshou had done it.</p><p>Before this, she really didn’t take this junior to heart.</p><p>A competition of who could fly higher?</p><p>What kind of strategy could a little fellow who could only fly high have?</p><p>Now, Rao Yaoyao only felt that the biggest threat to the Holy Divine Palace might really be that person who was surnamed “Xu” in the future.</p><p>Looking back, she realized that she had indeed started to fight against Xu Xiaoshou under the persuasion of Night Guardian and the rest.</p><p>However, she still couldn’t figure out when Xu Xiaoshou would make his move, when he would counterattack, what method he would use, and the goal he wanted to achieve!</p><p>She hadn’t even placed her focus on this junior, yet she didn’t know when she had fallen into Xu Xiaoshou’s trap.</p><p>Just like what Night Guardian had said, the best way to deal with Xu Xiaoshou was not to deal with him but to take him down directly.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao finally understood the meaning of Night Guardian’s words!</p><p>However, these lessons that she had learned with blood did not seem to be able to keep her going.</p><p>“Night Guardian…”</p><p>Thinking of Night Guardian, Rao Yaoyao thought of those helpless cries for help in the deep sea.</p><p>She closed her eyes heavily.</p><p>In the end, even Night Guardian seemed to know something and might choose to rebel.</p><p>The only fortunate result was that Cutting Paths would inevitably not escape the devouring of the Deep Sea and would die a tragic death.</p><p>“Ha!” Rao Yaoyao laughed bitterly.</p><p>She was all alone and only had Cang Godhood Sword to accompany her.</p><p>Holding Xuan Cang tightly, Rao Yaoyao shook her head, her gaze determined again.</p><p>“Let it go, Rao Yaoyao, let go of everything!”</p><p>“You’re no longer the young miss you used to be. It’s time for you to pay the price for your actions!”</p><p>Only now then did she realize that she did not have the talent in commanding.</p><p>Why was it that a few decades ago, the task assigned to her was to command the red-clothed people, who deal with the unintelligent ghost beasts? Moreover, for her task, she only needed to command and not deal with the cunning dark forces on the continent?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao seemed to understand a little.</p><p>If she wanted to use her power to prove that her intelligence was not inferior to Dao Qiongcang’s, she would only end up with a tainted reputation.</p><p>Perhaps sitting in seclusion for thirty years like Hua Changdeng and becoming a saint on the spot was the best form of respect for the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, can you even calculate all these?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao looked up at the sky in silence, but she couldn’t get an answer.</p><p>If Dao Qiongcang could calculate all the divine secrets, how could he not have predicted Yi and Teng Shanhai’s death? Under such circumstances, how could he still allow himself to command the Eastern Region?</p><p>If he couldn’t…</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>Gripping the Cang Godhood Sword tightly, Rao Yaoyao didn’t think too much and directly flew over the place, leaving the Forest of Miracles.</p><p>Just like what she understood at that moment.</p><p>She would just admit that she was an idiot!</p><p>She would ask what she should ask, and kill the person who should be killed with her sword. This was her way of the sword. Why waste decades and neglect the essentials to play with the so-called “power” and “influence”, “schemes” after “schemes”?</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>In the ancient forest, there was no one left, only a rippling cyclone with a faint Holy Path.</p><p>“Holy Power…”</p><p>Jiang Buyi retracted his gaze and narrowed his eyes in deep thought.</p><p>As expected, had Rao Yaoyao already come into contact with this level?</p><p>However, just now, when she attacked, why didn’t she have any trace of touching the Holy Path?</p><p>Without thinking too much, Jiang Buyi felt the changes in Forest of Miracles and knew that he did not have much time left.</p><p>Things had to be solved one by one.</p><p>Now that Teng Shanhai’s matter was over, it was time to settle the score with the brat who had used him as a weapon!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou? That’s your name, right?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi paced with his hands behind his back and said calmly to the void, “She has left, and now only the two of us are here. Would you like to come out and have a chat?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
