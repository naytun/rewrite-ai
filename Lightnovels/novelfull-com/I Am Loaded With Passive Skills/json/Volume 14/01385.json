It’s called the Mo Sword Technique, which can create tens of thousands of swords that can hurt the true self.”</p><p>Mei Siren was no longer gentle with the red plum in his hand. His eyebrows and eyes focused, and his body was like a sword as his aura broke through the clouds.</p><p>With a swish, a cyclone appeared a hundred miles away.</p><p>Then, countless green Mo Swords appeared out of thin air along with the Mei Siren’s voice and turned into a turbulent river. It roared and rolled, instantly crushing Jiang Buyi’s holy realm!</p><p>The flood of sword energy turned into an endless green light, pouring into the red plum on Mei Siren’s fingertip.</p><p>For a moment, the red plum was like a sword, and the fragrance drifted for thousands of miles like sword cries.</p><p>“The first realm of the Mo Sword Technique, Green River Sword Boardline!” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes widened.</p><p>He knew about this technique. It was the same technique that Gou Wuyue used when he fought against Bazhun’an.</p><p>Could Master Siren also know it?</p><p>Furthermore, the “Green River Sword Boardline” that he controlled could even break the holy realm.</p><p>“This is crazy!” Xu Xiaoshou held his head, his eyes filled with shock.</p><p>Was this the power of an experienced swordsman at the highest level?</p><p>Was this the ability that the sword cultivators of the same generation as You Tu, the previous Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace and the number one out of the three swordsmen, had mastered?</p><p>A Sword Deity wanted to fight against a demi-saint?</p><p>Therefore, he wasn’t as good as he thought he was and wasn’t worthy of being the spokesperson of Mo Sword Technique.</p><p>Just as Xu Xiaoshou was thinking about this, he saw that Master Siren, who was holding the red plum blossom in his hand, was like a sharp sword that had been unsheathed. His sharp killing intent had completely torn apart Jiang Buyi’s pressure.</p><p>“Sword World Walking, Sword River Splitting Clouds…”</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>With the final word, Mei Siren threw it out.</p><p>The red plum flower flew over and turned into a blooming red sword flower before the Holy Light of Saints could reach it. It completely resisted the impact of the Holy Power.</p><p>“No matter how strong the power of a Sword Deity is, in theory, it can’t be stronger than the Holy Power.”</p><p>Just as Xu Xiaoshou was on tenterhooks, the Red Sword that was resisting the Holy Light of Saints trembled slightly. Then, as if it was responding to Master Siren’s words, green swords emerged from it.</p><p>“Swish, swish, swish…”</p><p>The red plum flower, which had devoured the endless Mo Swords of the Green River Sword Boardline, was able to resist or even counter the suppression of the Holy Light of Saints and the power of evil extermination.</p><p>The Holy Light of the cloud attribute could not hide Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes.</p><p>He could see that the Mo Swords were completely piercing through the Holy Light of Saints from the bottom to the top in an indestructible manner!</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gasped.</p><p>Even Rao Yaoyao’s Cang Godhood Sword could not withstand the Holy Light of Saints.</p><p>Could Master Siren’s Mo Sword Technique break one move of the demi-saint Jiang Buyi?</p><p>This could no longer be called Mo Sword Technique. Or could it be that the Mo Sword Technique he had seen in the past was something that wasn’t up to standard?</p><p>“Mo Sword, Mo Sword…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of something.</p><p>The greatest ability of the Mo Sword Technique was that it could ignore defense and attack with real damage.</p><p>In other words, it wasn’t that Gou Wuyue was weak, but if one had cultivated Mo Sword Technique into the realm of Master Siren, he could even break the Holy Power with one move.</p><p>It was normal to challenge someone of a higher realm. However, a higher void surpassed a Saint…</p><p>Could this be considered normal?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not sure and decided to wait.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, watch carefully…”</p><p>The words that Master Siren said before he attacked flashed through his mind. At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou finally understood Master Siren’s intention.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought, “Was he going to teach me how to break the Holy Power like Elder Sang did the other day?”</p><p>He began to get excited.</p><p>Previously, he did not take the Nine Major Sword Techniques of the ancient swordsman to heart because he felt that he had Sword Technique Expertise and did not need others to teach him the sword.</p><p>However, along the way, he realized that this was not the case.</p><p>Sword Technique Expertise was like a library of swordsmanship being forcefully stuffed into one’s mind. How to use it and how to unleash the full power of the knowledge within required other sword moves to activate.</p><p>Without a doubt, the Nine Major Sword Techniques, Eighteen Sword Forms, and 3000 Sword Styles of the ancient swordsman were the key to opening this library of swordsmanship.</p><p>After experiencing so much, Xu Xiaoshou had long wanted to seriously ask Bazhun’an about the ancient swordsman’s swordsmanship, the types of the sword, and the Way of the Sword.</p><p>However, before Bazhun’an arrived, Master Siren gave him another chance. Master Siren came to him again and personally displayed it.</p><p>“Mo Sword Technique…”</p><p>“What Master Siren is applying now is the Mo Sword Technique. He is teaching me the highest level of the Mo Sword Technique.”</p><p>“No, it’s not the highest level yet. But it’s already a very high level for him to use the higher void level Mo Sword Technique to fight against a demi-saint.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were fixed on the green Mo Swords that shot out from the red plum blossom. He felt that the illusionary Mo Swords were being broken down into comprehensions of the Way of the Sword in his mind.</p><p>These comprehensions could be verified and explained from his knowledge base of Sword Technique Expertise.</p><p>He was like a greedy sponge, crazily absorbing the knowledge he needed.</p><p>“The Mo Sword Technique is open and different. It can stand on its own and advance forward.”</p><p>“It corroborates the Dao Penetration of the 3000 Sword Styles, the defense disregard, and the real damage.”</p><p>“This is the second sword of a swordsman. It came from a parallel universe. All physical defenses in the current universe can’t withstand its attack. Even the Holy Power should not.”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou thought about it, he unconsciously held his Hidden Bitter.</p><p>Even he didn’t notice that the black sword Hidden Bitter, which was writhing like a maggot in excitement now, had a faint green light.</p><p>He looked at Master Siren.</p><p>This arrogant swordsman in purple robes was forming the grandest image of the Sword Deity in Xu Xiaoshou’s mind.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
