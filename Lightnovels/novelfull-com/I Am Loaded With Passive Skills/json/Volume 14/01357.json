I’m Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou spread his hands. He didn’t morph into his own appearance, but his voice reverted to his original tone.</p><p>He had never felt so defeated before.</p><p>He had fooled so many smart people on the Shengshen Continent, but what was going on with his identity on the Abyss Island?</p><p>It was fine to have his identity uncovered, but to have it disclosed so instantly was too much…</p><p>It would have been fine if it had been Rao Yaoyao who had recognized him, but this Teng Shanhai’s brain didn’t seem to have much of a Spiritual Light. How did he do it?</p><p>“How did you recognize me?” Xu Xiaoshou stroked his beard, his eyes full of curiosity.</p><p>“Hahahahahahahaha!” Teng Shanhai laughed out loud. His single eye was filled with joy but also a little bit of disbelief. “So, you really are Xu Xiaoshou? ”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>“Are you trying to trick me?”</p><p>He was a little dazed initially, but when he recalled the information in the information bar just now, it had clearly changed from ‘suspected’ to ‘confirmed’.</p><p>In other words, Teng Shanhai must have used some method to confirm his identity.</p><p>For him to ask such a question now, it was obviously a subconscious reaction after being deceived in the past, and not really deceiving himself.</p><p>Right!</p><p>So, it was like this!</p><p>After giving himself a way out, Xu Xiaoshou’s expression was sincere as he said, “Tell me, so I can die with a clear understanding?”</p><p>“Hmph, you still want to prolong the time?”</p><p>Teng Shanhai was no longer the Teng Shanhai of the past. The first thing he thought of was Xu Xiaoshou’s trick, a trick that smart people often used to stall for time!</p><p>But it was good that he wanted to stall for time!</p><p>It would take some time for the power for his Holy Blood to reach its peak power.</p><p>Although Teng Shanhai didn’t know where Xu Xiaoshou’s Holy Power came from, he felt that with Xu Xiaoshou’s ability, he might have already discovered his traces.</p><p>At this moment, he had already consumed the Holy Blood and had waited for his arrival!</p><p>However, how could a Master Stage and a Higher Void level be on the same level when they consumed Holy Blood?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I admit that you have some skills. Your method of suppressing the treasure is indeed powerful. There was a time when I couldn’t find it. I even lost contact with it.”</p><p>Teng Shanhai shook his head and sighed. He stared at Xu Xiaoshou, who looked like Jiang Buyi, with his single eye and said solemnly, “What’s mine is mine. Even if you take it by force, you can’t break the bond between me and it!”</p><p>Treasure…</p><p>It…</p><p>Snatch it away forcibly…</p><p>With Xu Xiaoshou’s intelligence, he instantly understood what Teng Shanhai meant. He said in surprise, “You’re talking about the Xiao Divine Spear?”</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Teng Shanhai sneered and clenched his fist in the air. It seemed that he was about to summon something through space.</p><p>The reason why the Divine Instrument Inscription Stele was known as a Divine Instrument was because in that era, it was a treasure that was not inferior to the 21 Famed Swords.</p><p>“The reason why it’s on the Inscription Stele was because it had been lost for a period of time. However, it did not mean that its strength had weakened.”</p><p>“On the contrary, under the precipitation of time, it could even make great progress and improve further!”</p><p>“Ka!”</p><p>The Void cracked.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could feel the trembling of his Yuan Mansion.</p><p>The suppressed spear, the Xiao Divine Spear, which he had snatched from Teng Shanhai during the night battle in the Imperial City, struggled madly as it tried to break out of the realm.</p><p>“Dog thief, now I see!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cursed angrily in his heart when he thought of the Famed Sword of the Green Scale Ridge that he snatched from Lu Ke’s hands back in the White Cave. Because of the other party’s summons, it would break out of the realm again.</p><p>He had thought that this was an ability that only the 21 Famed Swords had. He had never thought that the bond between Teng Shanhai and the Xiao Divine Spear was as profound as the bond between the Famed sword and its Sword-bearer.</p><p>And the level of the Xiao Divine Spear was obviously not any weaker than an ordinary Famed Sword!</p><p>“What’s your plan?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t believe it.</p><p>If this was a backup plan that Teng Shanhai had left behind during the night battle in the Imperial city, then this person was just pretending to be ‘a pig to eat the tiger’. His true intelligence was probably not inferior to Rao Yaoyao and Gou Wuyue.</p><p>He had definitely underestimated him!</p><p>When he heard this, Teng Shanhai was stunned for a moment. then, he puffed out his chest proudly as his eyes filled with confidence.</p><p>“That’s right!”</p><p>“That’s right, your ass!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw his subconscious reaction and knew that this guy thought he was taking advantage of the situation. He had a lightbulb moment and suddenly he understood something.</p><p>“Teng Shanhai, don’t flatter yourself. If this was really your backup plan, why did you not recognize my true form on the Lone Cliff?” Xu Xiaoshou sneered.</p><p>“The Lone Cliff?”</p><p>When he heard this, Teng Shanhai’s imposing aura suddenly stagnated.</p><p>Indeed, he had a faint feeling that Xu Xiaoshou was hidden among the crowd when he was on the Lone Cliff.</p><p>Because at that time, he also felt the faint restraint of the Xiao Divine Spear, even if it was not as strong as it was now.</p><p>However…</p><p>“On the Lone Cliff, I believed Huang Quan’s slanderous words and really thought that you had died at his hands. Even the Xiao Divine Spear had been taken by him, so I naturally didn’t want to put up a fight.”</p><p>“Moreover, Rao Yaoyao was the leader there. If I were to make a move, wouldn’t I disrupt her plans?”</p><p>It had been a long time since Teng Shanhai had been acknowledged as someone with brains. Moreover, the person who had acknowledged him was the intelligent Xu Xiaoshou, who had repeatedly foiled the plans of the Holy Divine Palace.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
