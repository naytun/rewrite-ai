This was a place that was on par with the Hall of Sins and other places of absolute death.</p><p>Normally, the nine most dangerous places were not very dangerous. There was not even a living creature to be seen.</p><p>However, once someone triggered some mechanism, the nine most dangerous places would be activated, turning into the abyss of gluttony that devoured life. No one, not even a demi-saint, could escape from it.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was panicking now…</p><p>That was because, until today, no one on Abyss Island had been able to find out where the mechanism that would activate the nine most dangerous places was and exactly how it was activated.</p><p>However, now that he had seen the spiritual physique of the Ghost City, it meant that the Ghost City was slowly recovering.</p><p>Once the spiritual physique of the Ghost City was fully activated, he might really die here.</p><p>“I have to find a way out and leave this place.”</p><p>To others, the foundational roots of Saint Ascension were within reach, but not exactly within their reach.</p><p>Jiang Buyi would abandon it like a worn shoe!</p><p>He was a demi-saint!</p><p>He didn’t even have the slightest intention of coveting the position of Holy Emperor!</p><p>The Jiang clan in the northern region didn’t have the position of Holy Emperor at all. This meant that if he wanted to become a Holy Emperor, he would need to hunt down a Holy Emperor before he could succeed.</p><p>How could he succeed?</p><p>“I didn’t have the intention to rebel, but I was exposed.”</p><p>“Not only did I come to Abyss Island, I even directly entered the Ghost City. What’s going on? !”</p><p>Jiang Buyi was furious that he was in danger before he could get the Lei family’s eyes.</p><p>However, this place was like a maze. He didn’t specialize in the path of soul and spirit, so he couldn’t find his way out. Unless there was an external force involved, Jiang Buyi felt that he would have to continue fighting in this place.</p><p>At this moment…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A white light bloomed in the distant sky, like a blazing sun descending into the world, bringing hope and guidance.</p><p>“In this direction!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s eyes lit up.</p><p>This was definitely a fight on Abyss Island.</p><p>Although it was definitely not to save him, such a huge commotion could even be seen by Jiang Buyi, who was far away in the Ghost City.</p><p>“Benefactor!”</p><p>“No matter who you are, as long as I find you, I will definitely reward you properly!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi deeply remembered the location of the explosion. This energy attribute made him afraid that he would still be lost in the various predicaments of the Ghost City like how he had been many times before.</p><p>Then, he protected his body with holy power and headed straight forward.</p><p>“Bang Bang Bang…”</p><p>Wherever he passed, whether solid walls, ancient trees, or spiritual physique, all of them exploded on the spot.</p><p>Afraid that something would change, Jiang Buyi intended to rush out of the Ghost City in the shortest amount of time!</p><p>As for the obstacles…</p><p>In front of a demi-saint, everything was an illusion.</p><p>Jiang Buyi charged forward!</p><p>…</p><p>“PFFT! PFFT!”</p><p>White flames shot out from the cracks in the ground.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>In the next second, the active volcano behind them spewed a large amount of white lava into the sky.</p><p>In front of the Inferno Zone, Mei Siren was breathing in the scorching wind. His movements as he waved his paper fan were no longer sage-like.</p><p>He sat cross-legged on a big rock and closed his eyes to rest. It seemed like he had been waiting here for a century.</p><p>Beside him were two stone swords that he had carved himself.</p><p>The stone swords were simple and unadorned. They didn’t have any exquisite patterns or any special abilities. They couldn’t even be considered a grade-ten spiritual weapon.</p><p>However, this was something that Mei Siren had prepared for himself and his next disciple.</p><p>“Sigh,”</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Mei Siren felt that the white lava was about to flow to his feet. He had no choice but to get up and change his position.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, when will you arrive?”</p><p>Beside the Temple River, at the request of Bazhun’an, Mei Siren held the void token in his hand. Before anyone knew it, he had already arrived at Abyss Island.</p><p>However, after waiting for so long, Xu Xiaoshou still hadn’t arrived.</p><p>On second thought, by the time Xu Xiaoshou arrived at Abyss Island and spent some time in the Inferno Zone, he wouldn’t know how long it would be before the other party could find him.</p><p>Mei Siren regretted it.</p><p>He had wasted so much time and was sweating bitterly in front of the embers of the fire. This didn’t match his identity as “Master Siren” at all.</p><p>Why would a teacher wait for their student to come to class?</p><p>This action of his had seriously devalued his status!</p><p>Mei Siren wanted to leave Abyss Island. He looked into the distance and found the position of the City Gate. He decided to wait for another three days.</p><p>If nothing happened within these three days, it meant that Xu Xiaoshou and he were fated to be apart!</p><p>At this moment, a white light lit up in the distant sky.</p><p>Then, a low rumbling sound was heard in the distance.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Mei Siren’s expression froze.</p><p>What kind of luck was this?</p><p>Just as he didn’t want something to happen, something did happen.</p><p>Mei Siren was very far away, so he didn’t know what had happened in that place.</p><p>However, seeing that from so far away, the sound of explosions and the white light could reach his ears and eyes…</p><p>One could imagine how powerful the sound was at the center of the explosion.</p><p>“Explosion…”</p><p>Mei Siren muttered to himself. After waiting for a long time, his dried eyes lit up slightly.</p><p>He remembered the conversation he had with Bazhun’an at the riverside of the temple.</p><p>“After entering Abyss Island, how do I find Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“You don’t need to find him. You just need to wait in front of the Inferno Zone. Xu Xiaoshou will go there.”</p><p>“Inferno Zone…but what if I wait too long?”</p><p>“If you wait too long, then you should look for the place where an explosion will take place.”</p><p>“Explosion?”</p><p>“Yes, wherever there is an explosion, there will be Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>This was really ridiculous…Mei Siren mocked in his heart again. However, he bent down and picked up two stone swords. Then, he rushed in the direction of the explosion in a hurry.</p><p>Although he felt that this was too absurd and too comical, Bazhun’an had already said so. No matter how unrealistic the matter was, he had to go and take a look personally to confirm it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
