Run! Run!”</p><p>Hong Dang wasn’t the only one running. Xiao Kongtong was running as well.</p><p>Even Ye Xiaotian was on the run after he completed the dirty deal at the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>Everyone’s goal seemed to be the same. They would rather their friends die instead of themselves; they wanted to live as long as possible.</p><p>He had thought that the Abyss Island was really full of opportunities as what Bazhun’an had said. The Foundational Roots of Saint Ascension were available to anyone.</p><p>After they arrived, everyone realized.</p><p>What Bazhun’an said was true.</p><p>However, he only mentioned the advantages of Sky City and did not mention the disadvantages.</p><p>All the opportunities here had to be exchanged with their lives!</p><p>“Bang Bang! Bang Bang! Bang Bang Bang Bang!”</p><p>Forest of Miracles, The Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>The sound of the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale’s heartbeat was so rapid that it made people feel dizzy.</p><p>Exchanging Hong Dang’s life was not a guarantee of his own opportunistic rise, so Xu Xiaoshou was busy expanding his Yuan Mansion Space World.</p><p>He had no idea what was happening in the outside world.</p><p>The only thing he knew was that he couldn’t miss the opportunity that brother Hong Dang had exchanged his life for.</p><p>Wasting even a single stalk of the Holy Medicine would be a form of disrespect to Hong Dang!</p><p>Absolutely not!</p><p>“Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz…”</p><p>The Spatial Passageway expanded as much as it could while the Holy Emperor Dragon Scales tried frantically to interfere.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou had gone crazy. Even if he knew that the Holy Emperor Dragon Scales tried to stop him, he couldn’t suppress the Great Demon King Xu’s desire. He had to ‘grab everything’!</p><p>Finally…</p><p>When the Spatial Passageway that spanned thousands of miles was constructed, even Xu Xiaoshou felt that he could not manage such a huge Spatial Passageway.</p><p>Through his ‘Perception’, he could see that the plot of land in the Yuan Mansion Space World was finally a perfect fit for the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Void Attendant!”</p><p>“I’m sorry, Brother Hong Dang!”</p><p>“I’m sorry, fellow Spiritual Cultivators who haven’t had time to come to the Abyss Island to pick the herbs.”</p><p>“The Herb Garden of Divine Farmer is surnamed Xu!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face suddenly turned ferocious. He closed his hand forcefully and the thousands of miles wide Spatial Passageway completely covered the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>There was a slight sound.</p><p>In this place, the rich Spiritual Energy and medicinal fragrance were no longer present.</p><p>What replaced it was a huge pit that spanned thousands of miles and was three thousand feet deep!</p><p>That’s right, the size of the Void Attendant was the depth that Xu Xiaoshou dug.</p><p>He didn’t want even a single stalk of the innocent weeds to be hurt. They still had to survive in the Yuan Mansion Space World. They couldn’t be destroyed.</p><p>Therefore, it was impossible to dig a pit that was only three feet deep.</p><p>Digging a three thousand feet pit was Xu Xiaoshou’s conservative and bottom line!</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>In a breath’s time, he had emptied the entire Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even dare to return to the Yuan Mansion. He took to his heels and flashed out of the Barrier Passageway.</p><p>Initially, his plan was to pick a few Saint Herbs or dig up one-tenth of them first, which was quite normal.</p><p>After a few more trips, all of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer would be his.</p><p>However, now that he was here in person, Xu Xaoshou understood why the Double Dumba*s could not give up the Holy Miracle Fruit, even when they were about to die.</p><p>“It’s not that I can’t let it go, I really can’t!”</p><p>“It’s not that I’m a scumbag. It’s that I have given every stalk of Spirit Medicine in this Herb Garden of Divine Farmer a portion of love!”</p><p>“Their final destination should not be to be buried in this Abyss Island where no one cares about them. Instead, they should be washed and turned into fertile and round pills in Elder Sang’s Auspicious Dragon and Phoenix bathtub!”</p><p>Weng…</p><p>Wiping away his drool, Xu Xiaoshou flashed to the ancient tree where Lei Xi-er had hidden herself.</p><p>“You got it?”</p><p>Lei Xi ‘er looked at Xu Xiaoshou’s crazed face. She was worried, expectant, terrified, and nervous. She asked carefully, “How much did you get?”</p><p>“A little bit.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand and said,</p><p>“There’s no time to explain. The Holy Emperor Dragon Scale is currently jumping around madly. Hurry up and hide in the Yuan Mansion.”</p><p>“Greedy the White Cat! Don’t you dare eat it! If you dare to touch even one stalk of Holy Medicine, I’ll make you swallow your cat’s fur!”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit white fur exploded.</p><p>“Meow”</p><p>“How much did you actually take?”</p><p>Lei Xi-er was silent.</p><p>She also felt that Xu Xiaoshou’s condition was a little off. She felt that he needed to use the God-Devil Eye’s purifying power to cleanse himself.</p><p>This was crazy!</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou didn’t blabber any nonsense to her as he dared not waste any more time.</p><p>He held Lei Xi ‘er in his left hand and picked up the little fat cat in his right. Then, he opened the passage to Yuan Mansion and threw the two of them inside.</p><p>“Vanishing Technique!”</p><p>“Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry…”</p><p>“Void Attendant, I’m so sorry!”</p><p>“But please, please, please, please don’t come and look for me!”</p><p>…</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Forest of Miracles.</p><p>The giant foot stomped down and the blood shadows flew across.</p><p>Dragon Fighter Hong Dang was a standard Physique Cultivator. His escape Spiritual Technique was not as good as the Double Dumba*s…</p><p>After running for so long, he had not even managed to run out of the perimeter of the Forest of Miracles.</p><p>Hong Dang, who was bruised and covered with blood, and whose wounds gushed with Holy Power, had gone crazy.</p><p>“I can’t die. I can’t die.”</p><p>“I’ve just swallowed the Holy Miracle Fruit. I’m the number one Higher Void level below the Demi-Saint realm. How can I die here?”</p><p>“I want to challenge Bazhun’an. I want to tear apart the clothes of that bitch Rao Yaoyao. I want to ruthlessly stomp on Teng Shanhai and treat him like a piece of rag!”</p><p>“I want to do that! I want to do that!”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>“Double Dumba*s… I want, I definitely want to kill you!”</p><p>Possessing a Dragon Soul, Hong Dang, who was 100 feet tall, was clearly like a small Giant. He could hold most of the Higher Void Level in the Shengshen Continent in his hands and kick them like a ball.</p><p>But now, he had become the ball, as he rolled and crawled under the feet of the three thousand feet tall Void Attendant and was as distressed as a dog.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
