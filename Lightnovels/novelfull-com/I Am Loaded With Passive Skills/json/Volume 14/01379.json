(2)</p><p>Ye Xiaotian gazed into the distance and said softly, “Although I place my hopes on Xu Xiaoshou, I don’t know how long it will take for him to grow. I might as well wait till I reach the higher void level and save him myself.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong did not turn back. The more he looked into the distance, the more nervous he became.</p><p>Of course, he understood how powerful a higher void would be if one cultivated the Spatial Upanishad. As long as they could find a way, they would be able to go anywhere in the world.</p><p>Hence, Ye Xiaotian’s choice was understandable.</p><p>However…</p><p>“This can’t hide the fact that you’re afraid.” Xiao Kongtong’s eyes shifted.</p><p>“That is a demi-saint! It’s not a higher void who consumed the Holy Blood, nor is it one of the imposters that Xu Xiaoshou put up!” Ye Xiaotian retorted in a fit of rage, “You can joke around with your life, but why did I spend my life cultivating so hard for?”</p><p>Upon hearing that, Xiao Kongtong was amused. He replied, “For the sake of ‘not daring’ or to ‘survive’?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was taken aback. Bristling with anger, he gathered his spatial spiritual source and was about to make a move.</p><p>“This is the difference between you and Sang Qiye,” Xiao Zhenzhen was unmoved, and with one sentence, the latter suddenly stopped.</p><p>“He can separate ways with me because our paths are different, and he can do his own things by himself for decades.”</p><p>“As for you, you’ve been hiding in that tiny Tiansang Spirit Palace. After so many years, I’m afraid that even your will has been obliterated.”</p><p>“Ye Xiaotian, think about it!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong turned around and said earnestly, “How old is Yu Lingdi when he comprehended the Water-type Upanishad. With your talent, you should have reached this step long ago!”</p><p>“If you’re still smug about this breakthrough that’s decades late, perhaps your future path will end here. Yet you still want to talk about the higher void level?”</p><p>“Comfort and ease won’t allow one to improve.”</p><p>“Retreating bravely and protecting oneself will also not allow any genius to become a saint!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian shuddered, and his pupils constricted.</p><p>He’d heard these words before.</p><p>Every time Elder Sang returned from his travels, he would drink and chat with them in the thatched house.</p><p>Every time, the thing he said the most was none other than…</p><p>“Tiansang Spirit Palace is like a cage. A caged bird that can’t see the outside world will be pleased with its current peaceful situation, but it will still demand a greater breakthrough. If this cage isn’t broken, a majestic sparrow will still be a sparrow, and a swan will still be a swan.”</p><p>In his memory, Elder Sang’s last words to him after his arm was cut off by Bazhun’an in Tiansang Spirit Palace were the same.</p><p>“Ye Xiaotian, be more decisive in the future. I’ve already told you so many times!”</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>He was one of the Four Disciples of the Holy Palace in the past. When did he develop such a cowardly and yes-man mentality?</p><p>It was like the admonishment of a close relative. A person’s natural reaction was to hear it in one ear and out the other. However, the care of a stranger could make one feel warm.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian felt as if he had been enlightened. He finally realized that Elder Sang had realized his problem many years ago and had even advised him many times.</p><p>As for himself, he had always be kept in the dark!</p><p>Did he not realize it?</p><p>No!</p><p>He didn’t dare!</p><p>He didn’t dare to break through that layer, didn’t dare to look at the sky outside again, and was willing to stay ignorant about the outside matters while guarding a safe land!</p><p>“Heh.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian shook his head and suddenly laughed.</p><p>He finally understood why the last barrier that had trapped him had inexplicably been broken after observing the battle in the Eighth Palace.</p><p>He should have broken through long ago!</p><p>However, it was precisely because he had lived in the cage for so many years that he had wasted so much time.</p><p>Why was Yu Lingdi able to grasp the Water-type Upanishad at around twenty? That was because he was battling all the time!</p><p>As one of the Four Disciples of the Holy Palace, he had delayed his spiritual cultivation journey for so long because of his so-called ‘cowardice’.</p><p>Even though he had mastered the Spatial Upanishad, he was still afraid of being slaughtered by Huang Quan as soon as he made a move. Unknowingly, he was so afraid that he sealed himself up.</p><p>Yes!</p><p>He was “afraid”!</p><p>The fellow in front of him was right, he had hit the nail on the head!</p><p>He, Ye Xiaotian, was afraid of Bazhun’an and Huang Quan. He had only attacked twice in so many years, and he had been beaten into seclusion both times. He was extremely afraid of them!</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s state of mind was in turmoil as he looked at the fluctuations of the Holy Power in the distance. Path Principles appeared around him, and wind and thunder gathered above the Nine Heavens, forming the clouds of calamity.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong raised his eyes.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>What happened to him?</p><p>Ye Xiaotian looked up at the calamity clouds of the Nine Heavens and suppressed his impulse.</p><p>His gaze became firm, and his gaze fell back on the person in front of him who had woken him up from his dream. He sighed.</p><p>“I have to say, not only are you, a rascal, good at acting, but you’re also very strong. You’re also very good at talking. You’re really something.”</p><p>A rascal?</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s eyelids twitched, and he snorted coldly, “Ye Xiaotian, show some respect when you speak!</p><p>“You’re not Bazhun’an, are you?” Ye Xiaotian smiled, and he did not even sound like he was asking.</p><p>“Oh?” Xiao Kongtong’s heart tightened.</p><p>“If you’re really Bazhun’an, with your trashy tracking methods, I’m afraid that Xu Xiaoshou would have died countless times. He wouldn’t even be able to get your support before he dies.” Ye Xiaotian’s eyes were filled with amusement.</p><p>“And from the way you’ve protected Bazhun’an to this extent, and from the level of your strength, you’re no longer as simple as a fanatic admirer of the so-called Eighth Sword Deity.”</p><p>“In this world, there are only a few people who can do this for Bazhun’an and master so many first stages of the Nine Major Sword Techniques.”</p><p>“Sword Deity Wen is one of them. He is a good friend of Bazhun’an, but he wouldn’t risk his life to this extent.”</p><p>“So, your identity is self-evident…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian paused for a moment before he said with absolute confidence, “Fringe Moon Immortal City’s Eldest Senior Brother, Xiao Kongtong!”</p><p>The mocking smile that had just appeared on Xiao Kongtong’s face immediately froze. He felt that the person in front of him seemed to have a different soul. Ye Xiaotian suddenly became a little scary!</p><p>“How are you going to prove that?”</p><p>“Drop your act. There aren’t many ancient swordsman who can cultivate to this level. It’s not like I haven’t seen the world.” Ye Xiaotian interrupted.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong sighed heavily, no longer putting on an act. He bowed slightly and said respectfully, “I’m Xiao Kongtong from Fringe Moon Immortal City. Greetings, senior.”</p><p>Whether he should say it or not, he was born half a generation later.</p><p>The white-haired person in front of him was Sang Qiye’s good friend and Sang Qiye was his teacher’s good friend. After some conversion, he should indeed refer to him as a senior.</p><p>In Xiao Kongtong’s heart, respecting his teacher was always his top priority.</p><p>“Not bad.” Ye Xiaotian smirked and said, “You’re quite well-mannered and your tone of voice is rather respectful too.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong felt a little awkward. Why was it that his status had changed all of a sudden, and it was now his turn to serve others?</p><p>“Don’t say anymore, senior. No matter how good Xu Xiaoshou is at holding on, he can’t hold on for much longer. Let’s hurry over.” Xiao Kongtong didn’t want to dwell on this topic.</p><p>The smile on Ye Xiaotian’s face had also disappeared, replaced by a solemn expression.</p><p>His body floated in the air as he slowly moved forward. He said, “I can go with you to see the demi-saint, but I have to say that I’m not strong enough to fight a demi-saint now.”</p><p>“Ha.” Xiao Kongtong subconsciously puffed out his chest. “It’s okay, I’m…”</p><p>“You’re not the Eighth Sword Deity, and you don’t have the ability of Bazhun’an! You may be able to fool the others, but a demi-saint isn’t as simple as you think, ” Ye Xiaotian interrupted.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian turned around with a grim expression. “Since you’re not Bazhun’an, you probably haven’t seen many demi-saints in your life. After all, if you ever need to deal with demi-saints, your teacher won’t let you take action.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong wanted to say something but stopped. What he said was right.</p><p>“I’m not the same…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian mumbled to himself with fear in his eyes, “The demi-saint in my memory could crush both of us with just a finger!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong gritted his teeth again, but he couldn’t say anything to refute him.</p><p>“I have to try.”</p><p>The task given to him by his teacher was to protect Xu Xiaoshou, so he couldn’t turn a blind eye to the situation.</p><p>“We should try, but we can not be as stubborn as you. We have to make some plans.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian paused for a moment and lowered his body, taking the initiative to lower half of his head to the person in front of him. He then spread out his hands and said in a carefree manner,</p><p>“Let me make this clear first. I can’t fight against Huang Quan and I can’t even take a single blow from a demi-saint, so…”</p><p>“You, how high are you?”</p><p>“Me?” Xiao Kongtong was slightly startled, then he took a deep breath and puffed out his chest, “As high as the sky!”</p><p>“Oh? You’re that tall?” Ye Xiaotian did not believe it. The strongest person below demi-saint was Bazhun’an. Who would dare to take on even half of Qingju?</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was strong, but compared to the truly famous seniors of the five regions, he could only be considered a powerful figure, if not unknown.</p><p>Where did he get the confidence to be as high as the heavens and only lower than Bazhun’an?</p><p>“It’s this high!” The smiling darling was resolute and decisive.</p><p>“How long can such height last under the hands of a demi-saint?” Ye Xiaotian raised his brows.</p><p>“Ten breaths!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
