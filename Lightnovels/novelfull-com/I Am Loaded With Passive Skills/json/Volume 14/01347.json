With nothing to do, he suddenly felt extremely bored.</p><p>According to the after-effects of taking the Holy Medicine, it would probably take more than a day to eat one Holy Medicine in this vast Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>Perhaps the time to take the Medicine could be shortened when the drug resistance increased and the sensitivity was not very high.</p><p>“But I definitely can’t eat the Dragon Apricot now.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the Dragon Apricot ancestral tree. He couldn’t help drooling and felt helpless.</p><p>He still cherished his life, so he didn’t dare to eat the Dragon Apricot now.</p><p>“Actually, the plan went very smoothly. I got the resources just like that. It’s a little surprising.” Xu Xiaoshou thought and sighed.</p><p>He originally thought that he would need to spend a lot of time and energy to find the legendary Foundational Roots of Saint Ascension after he entered the Abyss Island.</p><p>He had never thought that his first step would be to empty the entire Herb Garden of Divine Farmer. After breaking through to the Sovereign Dao Realm, the Cutting Path Stage, Higher Void Level, and even the Saint realm, he would probably not lack any more resources.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was at a loss.</p><p>During the past few months, he never had that much success in his whole life!</p><p>In his original plan, he could temporarily slow down the collection of passive points at this stage and spend more time looking for resources to break through to the Sovereign Dao Realm.</p><p>Because of this, the Passive System would be upgraded again, and he could give his passive skill babies some level points.</p><p>According to the plan, it would take a long time to collect resources. If he just used some passive points, he would have enough.</p><p>From the looks of it now, these plans really could not keep up with the Transformation!</p><p>Isn’t that right? He had collected all the resources. Now that he wanted to quickly break through to the Sovereign Dao Realm, he didn’t even know how many levels he could gain from the Passive Points.</p><p>He glanced at the bottom of the Information Bar.</p><p>Passive value: 2462232.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had not paid attention to this number for a long time.</p><p>He felt that he had almost forgotten about the Passive System.</p><p>However, that was not the case. After all, it was a passive skill. The greatest advantage of being passive was that it would always work even if you might forget about it sometimes.</p><p>He had intentionally accumulated more than two million Passive Points before.</p><p>After all, a large part of the reason why the Yunlun Mountain Range had hundreds and thousands of people under its command was to build up their Passive Points.</p><p>How?</p><p>Every day, he would take a little time to hold a plenary meeting and the Passive Points would come in.</p><p>Even if Xu Xiaosho spent most of his time doing his own stuff and didn’t walk with the team, he would talk to them whenever he had time. The Passive Points he accumulated numbered more than two million in this way.</p><p>“How many levels can it upgrade to?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know.</p><p>After all, he had yet to break through to the Sovereign Dao realm, and the Passive System had yet to awaken.</p><p>However, now that he had the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer and other resources, he would have to change his next goal.</p><p>Continue to gain more Passive Points in preparation for when he broke through to the Sovereign Dao Realm and he could instantly amass high-level passive skills!</p><p>“Will I be stuck in the Higher Void level, or will I directly break through to Demi-Saint Level 1?”</p><p>The Master Stage Heavenly Image Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to think so much, but the Master Stage Star Worship Xu Xiaoshou was already in high spirits at the thought of his Sovereign Physique body directly evolving into a Demi-Saint’s Physique and killing someone with a single punch.</p><p>He could kill his way up the Saint mountain within a few days!</p><p>“Hmm, I wonder how much trouble the Void Attendant has caused outside?”</p><p>It was really boring to stay idle. Even though he knew that the situation was not ideal right now and he needed to lie low for a while, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help wanting to go out and cause trouble.</p><p>It had been almost a day!</p><p>Perhaps the Void Attendant already had his fun outside?</p><p>Perhaps he could go out and check out the situation on the Abyss Island?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
