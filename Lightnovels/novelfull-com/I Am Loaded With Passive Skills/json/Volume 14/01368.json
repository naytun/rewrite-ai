It turned red at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>He shouted and his clothes fluttered even though there was no wind. His Holy Power formed a huge palm in the air which was about to slap the arrogant and disrespectful Teng Shanhai.</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>Teng Shanhai’s single eye also turned solemn as he shouted.</p><p>How could he not know that this slap was just an illusion conjured by Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Even though the Holy Power fluctuations on the other side were extremely realistic, Teng Shanhai endured the pressure and took out another drop of Holy Blood, ignoring the unwillingness in his heart. He was about to consume it and use its strength to overcome the other side’s power.</p><p>He had prepared for this for a long time already!</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>Before the two of them could complete their actions, a delicate shout sounded from the distance.</p><p>A ray of light whistled through the sky and transformed into the Godhood Sword Xuan Cang. It pierced the space between the two of them and separated them.</p><p>Teng Shanhai, who held the Holy Blood in his hand and had only contempt for the world, felt ashamed and angry. He only wanted to teach Jiang Buyi a lesson. However, after the arrival of this sword, they all froze and no longer moved.</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had disappeared in the air, saw the sword and knew that he could not stay here any longer.</p><p>He immediately started to shift his body and carefully observed whether Jiang Buyi would react to his actions in the disappearing state.</p><p>The answer was no.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was overjoyed. He quickened his pace and wanted to escape.</p><p>This place had become extremely dangerous, and all three of them held grudges against him. If he was discovered, he wouldn’t even know how he died.</p><p>Earlier, due to Teng Shanhai, the plan had surprisingly turned around and was being carried out smoothly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wanted to leave at that time and let the two fight.</p><p>However, Teng Shanhai’s brilliance stopped him from doing anything. The human sense of curiosity and the soul of gossip stopped Xu Xiaoshou in his tracks. He wanted to see how Teng Shanhai would court death.</p><p>This time, he could not.</p><p>If he didn’t leave now, his life would be in danger!</p><p>A hundred miles away, the Void Attendant was still deeply embedded in the space. It constantly swallowed the Holy Power around it as it tried to break free from its shackles.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou only gave it a mere glance before he looked away and tried to escape.</p><p>Similarly, when he was a hundred miles away from Jiang Buyi, the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale’s heartbeat suddenly accelerated. Its crazy heartbeat was at a frequency that even surpassed the speed when it encountered the Saint in the Deep Sea.</p><p>Startled. Passive Points, +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat. What did this mean?</p><p>Could it be that it was a warning to himself that if he took one more step out of this Arena, Jiang Buyi, who should not have noticed him, would discover the clues?</p><p>“Saint…”</p><p>When he thought of Jiang Buyi’s status, Xu Xiaoshou glanced back at the Void Attendant, who happened to be trapped a hundred miles away from Jiang Buyi, just like himself, and his heart sank.</p><p>He activated his ‘Perception’, held the Imitator, and switched to Ye Xiaotian. He then used the clearer Space Attributes to try to see through the distribution of the space node in this place.</p><p>As expected!</p><p>With Jiang Buyi as the center, the space node was densely packed within a hundred-mile radius and formed a spherical form field that was not inferior to Ye Xiaotian’s bounded domain!</p><p>If he had not used the space attributes, Xu Xiaoshou would not have been able to see this Intangible Domain at all!</p><p>“Bounded domain?”</p><p>“No! The power of this space node alone had completely surpassed the bounded domain. It should be called the holy realm!”</p><p>“The Demi-Saint has his own world. Without the suppression of the Spell Forbidden Barrier of the Deep Sea, Jiang Buyi had instinctively divided the surrounding hundred miles into his own world?”</p><p>“I have disappeared from this world and it is difficult for him to find me. However, a person who had disappeared had left his world and returned to the world of the Abyss Island.”</p><p>“This process will definitely cause a stir, no matter how minor it is, Jiang Buyi, who is at the Demi-Saint level, will definitely be able to detect my existence. Then, he will use a thunderbolt to lock onto my position and kill me.”</p><p>Looking at the space node that emitted the Holy Power, Xu Xiaoshou instantly understood.</p><p>He gulped visibly and his Adam’s apple bobbed, and his face was full of fear.</p><p>In the White Cave, the Storyteller was able to use the ‘Way of Heavens’ technique to reduce the range one by one and lock onto his own existence with this method of elimination, when he could not find him.</p><p>That was the first time Xu Xiaoshou had been restrained after he used the Vanishing Technique</p><p>This made him realize that the ‘Vanishing Technique’ was not infallible. As long as it was used too often, someone would always be able to find a way to counter it.</p><p>However, he had never expected that Jiang Buyi, who did not know who he was, would use his Saint’s instinct to trap him to death without even being aware of his existence!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was certain that Jiang Buyi’s ‘Holy Realm’ had not been deliberately created. It was just that a Demi-Saint had settled there and created his own world.</p><p>Even so, he was at his wit’s end.</p><p>“D*mn!”</p><p>In a moment of panic, Xu Xiaoshou held onto the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale and did not know what to do.</p><p>He had to thank Water Ghost for giving him this thing. If not for that, he would have met with an undeserved disaster at this moment, and there was a 90% chance that this disaster would destroy him!</p><p>Glancing back at the still-struggling Void Attendant, Xu Xiaoshou had a moment of enlightenment.</p><p>Perhaps, it was not because of Jiang Buyi’s perfect control of his power that the Void Attendant was only blasted a hundred miles away without dragging along a space crack that was thousands of miles away.</p><p>However, after Jiang Buyi’s attack, the Void Attendant was sent flying and crashed into the intangible Holy Realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
