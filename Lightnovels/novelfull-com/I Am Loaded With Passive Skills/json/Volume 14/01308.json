He decided that he would not be fooled again.</p><p>This time, his main purpose was not to find the so-called saint-ascension opportunity on the island.</p><p>This was hard to find for others, but it was nothing to Mu Ling.</p><p>The Holy Palace was a base to cultivate saints.</p><p>What Mu Ling wanted more was to find his disciple, Bai Lian, as soon as possible.</p><p>With Bai Lian’s cultivation level, even if he had many treasures, there was still a 10% risk of death on Abyss Island.</p><p>Bai Lian couldn’t die!</p><p>His disciple Hua Ying hadn’t matured yet. Once he died, Mu Ling didn’t even need to think about it. He knew that the authority of the infernal lineage would fall into his hands again.</p><p>In short, he would lose his freedom…</p><p>After painstakingly grooming a disciple and giving away the mess, he would be as carefree and happy as his master, Long Rongzhi, the Molten Dragon. How could Mu Ling pick up the troublesome work that he hadn’t done for decades?</p><p>“But this Dragon Melting Realm doesn’t look like something that Bai Lian can send out…”</p><p>Mu Ling looked into the distance and fell into deep thought.</p><p>How long had it been since Bai Lian had fought?</p><p>As of now, this guy only had the means to smash people with treasures. How could he bear to use the meager spiritual source of his life-saving cutting path stage to release such a huge spiritual technique?</p><p>The key was…</p><p>The intrinsic power of Dragon Melting Realm far surpassed that of the ordinary Infernal White Flame.</p><p>Even though they were far apart, Mu Ling could still vaguely smell the “Infernal Original Seed” from the power of the same origin.</p><p>Even he had never eaten this thing before. He had only felt it on his supreme master, Long Rongzhi.</p><p>If his senior brother, Sang Qiye, was not in the Sacred Mountain Prison’s Dead Sea, Mu Ling would definitely think that Sang Qiye was showing off again.</p><p>However, it was obviously not…</p><p>“Bai Lian has never eaten the Infernal Original Seed before. If that’s the case, then this skill of Dragon Melting Realm could only be unleashed by Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>“Is he in danger?”</p><p>“Something’s not right. Xu Xiaoshou is only at the master stage after all. How could he unleash such a level of Dragon Melting Realm?”</p><p>Mu Ling’s hand suddenly burst into black flames.</p><p>He felt that the level of that Dragon Melting Realm was almost close to his power.</p><p>“No matter what, let’s go and take a look.”</p><p>“People from the infernal lineage, even on the Abyss Island, can not be bullied!”</p><p>…</p><p>“What a huge explosion!”</p><p>Somewhere on Abyss Island, the orange-masked man with the five decays of Heaven and Man silently gazed at the white light in the distance.</p><p>After being forcefully dragged into Abyss Island by the void gate, he lost the location of Huang Quan and demi-saint Jiang Buyi and became alone.</p><p>However, the strange gravity here, as well as the restrictions of the rules and the various changes in the Sky City above Dongtianwang City before he entered the deep sea…</p><p>It was not difficult to come to the conclusion that this was Abyss Island.</p><p>“So, where are the so-called foundational roots of Saint Ascension?”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man pulled the mask off his face as if he was disgusted.</p><p>However, after thinking for a while, he put it back on.</p><p>“Just a little bit more.”</p><p>According to the plan, the deep sea would be the best time to hunt demi-saint Jiang Buyi.</p><p>At that time, he had the help of Huang Quan, a powerful space-time ability user. It could be said that the probability of killing a demi-saint was many times higher than now.</p><p>Unfortunately, the plan couldn’t keep up with the change in the situation.</p><p>It might be easy to find the foundational roots of Saint Ascension after coming to Abyss Island, but it would be as difficult as ascending to the sky to get the demi-saint’s identity.</p><p>“Of the 108 demi-saint qualifications, only those wandering around will be met by others. If the others want to ascend to the saint realm, they must first slaughter the saint and take his demi-saint qualification…”</p><p>“How difficult is it?”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man seemed to be troubled as he stared at the white light in the distance. He didn’t move his eyes for a long time.</p><p>“Infernal White Flame…?”</p><p>“Also, when we first arrived at Abyss Island, everyone wanted to avoid risks. Even I didn’t want to meet Huang Quan and Jiang Buyi again.”</p><p>“Which idiot dares to show off and announce his arrival with explosions?”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man suddenly sneered and walked toward the white light.</p><p>No matter what, since he had left the Deep Sea World, then this Abyss Island was the last chance to obtain the foundational roots of Saint Ascension and the demi-saint status.</p><p>If he couldn’t obtain it here, then it would be even harder for him to return to the Shengshen continent!</p><p>And now…</p><p>When everyone was hiding in the dark, this explosion attracted everyone’s attention.</p><p>Without a doubt, everyone would rush over.</p><p>They didn’t want to obtain any treasures, but they wanted to obtain some information about Abyss Island so that they could live better.</p><p>Since that was the case.</p><p>The hunt would begin at the center of the explosion!</p><p>“Explosion…”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man understood this point, and his footsteps became faster and faster. Finally, he rose into the air and turned into a dark stream of light, rushing toward the center of the target.</p><p>“That familiar explosion, it really makes me miss it…”</p><p>…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>With a finger, Jiang Buyi shattered the strange spiritual physique in front of him and obtained the Spirit Crystal. However, Jiang Buyi’s expression was extremely unsightly.</p><p>“The Ghost City of the Netherworld…”</p><p>“Damn it, how did we end up in this damned place!”</p><p>Outsiders didn’t understand Abyss Island, but as the ruler of a demi-saint family, how could Jiang Buyi not know?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
