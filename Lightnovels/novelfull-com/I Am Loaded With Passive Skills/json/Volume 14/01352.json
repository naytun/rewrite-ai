It was because of the commotion that the kid had caused in the Dongtianwang City.</p><p>The First Pavilion in the Sky was established right under Rao Yaoyao’s nose and was very successful. In the end, they entered the Yunlun Mountain Range and Xu Xiaoshou even managed to trick so many people.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong felt that Xu Xiaoshou was still a junior and his Combat strength was not as powerful as his own and could not be compared to the older generation.</p><p>However, to have just this kind of strong game ability was not something that ordinary people could do.</p><p>To put it bluntly, this guy had the ‘shit stirrer’ attribute.</p><p>On the bright side, this method of fighting with his brain and achieving success time and time again was no less than that of Dao Qiongcang and his teacher, Bazhun’an, when he was young.</p><p>Most importantly, Xu Xiaoshou had been using his Master Stage Cultivation level as a chess piece to fight against the other players.</p><p>Using chaos to deal with chaos.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian had been living in seclusion for many years, so it was unlikely that he could do it at the moment.</p><p>After the Fringe Moon Immortal City was established, Xiao Kongtong rarely did this.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou was there at the right time, so he could definitely do it.</p><p>“Find Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>After he thought of this, Xiao Kongtong had already decided on the direction to take. “You said that Xu Xiaoshou is here. I don’t believe that the condition of the Forest of Miracles has anything to do with him. He’s definitely in danger and might need help.”</p><p>“Help him…” Ye Xiaotian muttered to himself.</p><p>He believed the first half of the sentence, but for the second half, was it really Xu Xiaoshou who needed help and not Bazhun’an?</p><p>Once again, Ye Xiaotian began to doubt the identity of the person before him.</p><p>“What do you want to do?” Ye Xiaotian asked.</p><p>He had not reached the point where he needed the help of a disciple from the Tiansang Spirit Palace. At the same time, he was wary of the guy in front of him. It wasn’t Bazhun’an himself, but a fake who wanted to trick the Saint Servant.</p><p>After all, anyone who had seen Xu Xiaoshou’s transformation ability would not readily trust anyone in the world.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong shook his head slightly. He wanted to say ‘I really don’t know’, but he did not continue.</p><p>This was too degrading, and it would damage the teacher’s image.</p><p>“Find Xu Xiaoshou and subject him to a test!” He gave the ultimate instruction.</p><p>He turned his head to the side and stared at Ye Xiaotian with a serious expression as he continued,</p><p>“If he has a plan, it will be like ‘offering someone charcoal in the winter’. If he doesn’t have a plan, then that’s considered normal.”</p><p>“When the chaos here has reached this point, Xu Xiaoshou will be in a difficult situation. I can’t bring anyone with me through the Space-Time Transition, but your Space Attributes can pick him out and we can teleport away.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t that be the best of both worlds?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian slapped his forehead.</p><p>“Your wishful thinking has no content at all, but it’s clanking so loudly!”</p><p>However, despite his silent criticism, he had to admit that Xiao Kongtong was right about one thing. Xu Xiaoshou might be in danger, and Ye Xiaotian could not possibly ignore him if he chose to leave. After all, he was Elder Sang’s only hope.</p><p>“I’ll try.”</p><p>Without wasting any time, Ye Xiaotian immediately took out the Spatial Mirror, and layer by layer, he focused on the area within the Forest of Miracles in an attempt to find someone.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong moved closer without displaying any undue curiosity. He craned his neck to look at the powerful peeping attribute, and once again his knowledge of the white-haired youth was refreshed.</p><p>“You’re so skilled. You’ve done a lot of stealthy stuff like this, haven’t you?</p><p>“No one’s there…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian had located the position where Xu Xiaoshou had appeared earlier.</p><p>However, there was no one there, not even the herb garden. All that was left was a deep, black pit. It looked as if the land had been completely plundered by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“That’s impossible, right?”</p><p>“It can’t be, right?”</p><p>“Such a large medicine garden was really emptied?”</p><p>“How did Xu Xiaoshou do it?”</p><p>“Was this where Xu Xiaoshou was before?” Xiao Kongtong’s expression changed. Such a deep pit, was it caused by an explosion? As expected of you, Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“Yes.” Ye Xiaotian did not say much, but he suddenly thought of something.</p><p>Yuan Mansion!</p><p>He still remembered that Cheng Xingchu had sent him an abandoned Yuan Mansion in the Tiansang Spirit Palace as a bet with Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>The Yuan Mansion originated from a withered Extradimensional space. It had a great history, but it was basically impossible to activate it successfully. It required the assistance of a Spiritual Cultivator who was proficient in the Spatial Path and required the support of a Spirit Array Master.</p><p>This was something that the Tiansang Spirit Palace happened to have, which was why Cheng Xingchu had used it as a bet.</p><p>However, the reason why he still dared to take out the forsaken Yuan Mansion despite knowing this was purely because those were only the initial conditions.</p><p>The probability of activating the Yuan Mansion was still too small!</p><p>If not for the fact that Ye Xiaotian was born in the Holy Palace and had cultivated the Spatial Upanishad and that Qiao Qianzhi was not just any ordinary Spirit Array master, but the most talented genius among the Four Disciples of the Holy Palace, they would not have been able to activate the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>This led to Xu Xiaoshou obtaining an active Yuan Mansion in the end!</p><p>There were probably less than a handful of people in the world who had mastered the active Yuan Mansion!</p><p>After all, Ye Xiaotian only knew of three Spiritual Cultivators in the Continent’s Space : Ye Xiaotian himself, Huang Quan and Kong Yuhen.</p><p>Kong Yuhen and Ye Xiaotian knew only the bare minimum.</p><p>However, Huang Quan’s strength was in the coordination of Space Attributes. His attainments in the Spatial Path were far inferior to his. Even if he had had Qiao Qianzhi, he might not be able to activate his Yuan Mansion successfully.</p><p>Needless to say, Ye Xiaotian was well aware that Xu Xiashou had the prerequisite skills to empty out such a huge herb garden.</p><p>However, he also remembered that the space in his Yuan Mansion was very small, only equivalent to a slightly larger spatial ring. It was only good for storing living things.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
