Moreover, there was nothing he could do, so he had no choice but to fight head-on.</p><p>“Hahahaha!” Jiang Buyi, who had turned into a cloud of celestial colors, laughed wildly. He was amused by Mei Siren’s arrogant attitude.</p><p>After all, that man was just a Sword Deity and higher void cultivator.</p><p>If he could kill a Saint at this level, why was a demi-saint called a demi-saint?</p><p>“Show me what you got!”</p><p>Mei Siren sighed again and closed his eyes.</p><p>“I am sorry then.” After saying this, Mei Siren let his killing intent out and widened his eyes.</p><p>He no longer hesitated, held his left hand in front of his chest as if he was holding a huge scabbard, raised his right hand above his head, gently pinched, and lifted it.</p><p>“Swordsmanship is well-known. It’s called ‘nothing.’ The Dao of nothing combines illusion and reality, the mixing of real and fake. There is nothing in the world, but I say there is.”</p><p>The soft murmurs were heard first, followed by the surging of the wind. Then, the sky collapsed, and the earth cracked. Finally, everything turned into nothingness. The next second, they turned into a void sword in front of Mei Siren’s chest and were slowly pulled out.</p><p>Chi… Chi… Chi… Chi… Chi …</p><p>The shattering sound stopped, and time seemed to have stopped at this moment.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes widened. He knew why Mei Siren would explain the origin of each sword attack. This would give Jiang Buyi enough time to react, but he had another purpose.</p><p>It was time for teaching again.</p><p>Master Siren was dedicated, so he had to memorize every step.</p><p>“This is the first realm of Swordless Sword Technique, Swordless Sword Form!”</p><p>Intangible Sword was finally completely pulled out and hung in the air, reminding Xu Xiaoshou of the day when he fought Gu Qing San in City Lord Mansion of Tiansang City.</p><p>The only difference was that Gu Qingsan had transformed his body into a sword that hung in the sky, completely void.</p><p>On the other hand, Master Siren pulled out his sword in the air without moving his body, and it seemed that he could continue to attack.</p><p>“Look carefully, Xu Xiaoshou. You have to learn everything…” Mei Siren looked up silently as if he was talking to someone and whispered in her heart.</p><p>In the end, he retracted his gaze and returned to the battlefield. “Jiang Buyi, you have already made two moves. It’s my turn now,” he shouted with a different tone.</p><p>“The sword image’s debut!”</p><p>Even a calm man like Mei Siren could be triggered.</p><p>His sword showed his anger.</p><p>He was a teacher now but not the impulsive boy anymore, so Mei Siren didn’t plan to destroy everything and run riot!</p><p>And this moment was his first counterattack after being attacked by the demi-saint twice!</p><p>He hadn’t made a move, but he was ready to go big!</p><p>His sword had been quiet, but it was ready to defeat its enemy!</p><p>Intangible Sword was slashed out.</p><p>At this moment, the world twisted, and light and shadow changed. An inexplicable cold and dark aura attacked, making people shiver.</p><p>Mei Siren didn’t move his lips at all, but every onlooker in the Arena could hear Taoist music.</p><p>“The sword technique has a name, and it’s called Nine. The Dao of Nine is the extreme of the number and can give rise to countless possibilities. This is the formation, and the gate of hell is opened! ”</p><p>Intangible Sword slashed into the air, and Mei Siren’s body and Nine Swords flew to catch up. The formation was set in the middle, and then the heaven and earth entered Nine Sereneties. The invisible gate of hell opened, and an absolute chill suddenly invaded the entire Forest of Miracles.</p><p>Buzzing…</p><p>The dark objects passed through the gloomy sky.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes widened. This was the first realm of the Nine Swords Technique, Infinite Number?</p><p>Wait, when Gu Qinger was fighting Flame Python in White Cave, his Nine Swords Technique clearly showed the time attribute.</p><p>No!</p><p>At that time, Gu Qinger used the time attribute, but his and Master Siren’s Nine Swords Technique had one thing in common, formations!</p><p>Did it mean that the nine Swords Technique was used to form a sword formation?</p><p>The time attribute was only one of them?</p><p>When Master Siren used Nine Swords to fix the formation and open the gate of hell, did he turn the attribute of the sword formation into a phantom?</p><p>However, why did he set the phantom attribute and open the gate of hell?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>Could it be that…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
