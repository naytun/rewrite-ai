He would think that Teng Shanhai was the hidden tenth Saint Servant!</p><p>Teng Shanhai was too desperate!</p><p>If he didn’t cut off the head that was sent to his sword, how could he stop his arrogance?</p><p>It could be said that Teng Shanhai’s death was all because of his dirty mouth.</p><p>Jiang Buyi didn’t even think that “Xu Xiaoshou” could control people’s minds to such an extent and lead Teng Shanhai to do such blasphemous things.</p><p>Or maybe the plan itself didn’t consider the death of the person and only went along with the flow.</p><p>Teng Shanhai was rather disappointing…</p><p>However, from another perspective, he was too determined!</p><p>“Tap, tap, tap…”</p><p>At the border of the Holy Realm, the sound of footsteps was gradually getting softer.</p><p>Jiang Buyi took a deep breath. He did not think too much about those troubles.</p><p>With Teng Shanhai’s death, this matter could be considered both big and small. Whether it could be resolved or not would depend on how he would deal with it.</p><p>“Stop.” He finally opened his eyes and his gaze landed on Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s footsteps paused. She lifted her Cang Godhood Sword and turned around in a towering rage. “Jiang Buyi! You’ve disregarded me and killed him. What? Now, you even want to keep me?”</p><p>“Sword Deity Rao’s words are too harsh…” Jiang Buyi’s gaze moved down from the beautiful face of the woman in the distance, swam past her blood-stained dress, and finally fixed on her blood-stained jade-like feet.</p><p>To be more precise, his gaze was on the shoes that Rao Yaoyao was stepping on.</p><p>“You can leave, but leave your shoes.” Jiang Buyi only took a glance at her before moving his gaze away.</p><p>Within the Holy Realm, nothing could hide from him.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao thought that her tricks had worked, but little did she know that Jiang Buyi had already grasped everything in his hands.</p><p>She stepped on the blood foam and used the Cang Godhood Sword to support herself to prove that she was empty-handed when she left. She wanted to take away Teng Shanhai’s blood sneakily?</p><p>Did she think that he, Jiang Buyi, grew up sheltered?</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>Hearing this, Rao Yaoyao clenched her fists tightly. She knew that she could no longer hide her little thoughts. With a kick, she kicked her right shoe over.</p><p>“Here you go,”</p><p>With a whoosh, the Holy Light of Saints descended and crushed the shoe into nothingness. Jiang Buyi did not even dare to use his hands to hold the shoe, for fear that he would be used as a host.</p><p>“The other one.” He continued.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was furious.</p><p>She had used her right shoe to step on the blood. She did not have the time to stain her left foot. Since Jiang Buyi had noticed her small movement, it was impossible that he did not notice this.</p><p>“I’m sorry.” However, Jiang Buyi did not back down. He faced the anger of the other party and said calmly, “You know, it’s not very convenient to walk with only one shoe.”</p><p>“Here you go!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao kicked with her left foot again, sending the remaining shoe flying.</p><p>“Sizzle~”</p><p>Exterminated!</p><p>Jiang Buyi did not release her. His gaze locked onto Rao Yaoyao again.</p><p>“Huh?” Rao Yaoyao was amused. “What? Could it be that I’m covered in blood, and you can’t tell which is mine and which is Teng Shanhai’s? Do you need me to take off my dress for you?”</p><p>“I don’t dare to.” Jiang Buyi shook his head.</p><p>What he was staring at wasn’t Rao Yaoyao’s dress, but her Cang Godhood Sword!</p><p>This sword was indeed like Rao Yaoyao’s dress. It had not been stained with the slightest “trace” of Teng Shanhai.</p><p>However, as one of the five chaotic divine weapons, perhaps it had its own mysteries?</p><p>“You also want to check the fate suppression weapon of the Holy Divine Palace?” Rao Yaoyao understood his gaze and her face turned cold.</p><p>Jiang Buyi really wanted to investigate!</p><p>However, he knew that he didn’t have the ability to understand the divine sword. Even if he had it, he wouldn’t be able to study it.</p><p>Moreover, Rao Yaoyao and the Cang Godhood Sword had previously received the baptism of the Holy Light of Saints. Even if they had really swallowed something, they would probably have been washed clean.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was just worried about the shoes.</p><p>“I won’t send you off.”</p><p>He no longer insisted and chose to let her leave.</p><p>It was best not to provoke those he shouldn’t provoke.</p><p>After all, the person in front of him wasn’t an ordinary higher void or sword deity. Her surname was Rao!</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao snorted coldly and called away Xiao Divine Spear. She turned around and was about to walk out of the Holy Realm.</p><p>“You can leave, but not with the spear,”</p><p>Jiang Buyi stopped her halfway and kept Xiao Divine Spear in his bag. Facing the flustered and exasperated look, he added, “After this, the Jiang clan of the Northern Region will present an Inscription Stele of the same level to the Sacred Mountain in return.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao gritted her teeth.</p><p>This damn old thing really didn’t want to leave her with a way out!</p><p>“Sigh.”</p><p>She let out a long sigh of relief and didn’t plan to say anything more. She picked up her sword and left.</p><p>…</p><p>“Boom boom boom-”</p><p>Just as she left the Holy Realm, the scenery changed.</p><p>The oppressive feeling of dark clouds pressing down on the city brought by the demi-saint’s anger was no longer there. In its place was the sky that the Forest of Miracles had completely cracked.</p><p>This feeling of oppression was even more terrifying than when she was facing Jiang Buyi in the Holy Realm!</p><p>“Extreme grounds…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was startled and seemed to understand something.</p><p>Demi-saint Jiang Buyi’s all-out attack had stimulated the Forest of Miracles.</p><p>As one of the nine deathtraps, the Forest of Miracles had been activated. It had turned into a giant mouth of a Taotie, devouring all the spiritual cultivators who were trapped within.</p><p>The Way of the Heavens had completely abandoned its disdainful nature…</p><p>The spiritual source in the energy reserve was rapidly flowing away, and it couldn’t be stopped…</p><p>The originally dilapidated Forest of Miracles was once again filled with lush ancient trees. It was as if a broken wood had transformed into another form, the trees became even denser.</p><p>These ancient trees were no longer as useless as before.</p><p>On the contrary, they moved and changed their form, baring their fangs and brandishing their claws. As if they had become a spirit, several branches whipped out from their crown.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
