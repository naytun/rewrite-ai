They didn’t look like Void Attendants, but like giants pieced together from stones.</p><p>The numbers were extremely terrifying!</p><p>A total of three to four hundred stone giants stepped out.</p><p>The smallest was as big as the Void Attendant, the guardian of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, while the largest was more than a thousand feet in size!</p><p>“Damn you!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who hadn’t even started his plan yet, was so frightened that he almost retreated back into his Yuan Mansion.</p><p>He immediately concluded that they were definitely coming for him. In his mind, it was the executioner who led the countdown to his death!</p><p>“But don’t I still have nine days?”</p><p>“Aren’t you going to give me a chance to atone for my mistake?”</p><p>Summoning the Spatial passageway into the Yuan Mansion, what was left of Xu Xiaoshou’s remaining rationality told him to calm down. There should still be nine days left, and the will of the Abyss Island would not lie.</p><p>He pinched the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale, but the heartbeat did not increase.</p><p>These hundreds of stone giants were either good-for-nothings who appeared huge and their combat strength were not worth mentioning, or…</p><p>“These stone giants were not looking for me?”</p><p>He looked at the stone giants who flew in different directions. Some of them even flew over his head, but they didn’t stop to look at him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded.</p><p>“No way! There’s someone who’s even crazier than me on the Abyss Island and managed to provoke so many stone giants?”</p><p>“He can’t possibly have shifted the other Herb garden, right?”</p><p>“That’s not right. Shifting a Herb garden would only cause the ire of one Void Attendant. Who was that guy? Don’t tell me he even grabbed a Demi-Saint?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned as he watched these stone giants rush crazily into the Forest of Miracles. It was so obvious that they were frantically searching for someone.</p><p>They roared as they wreaked havoc along the way, and it looked like even the bitter tea seeds had been stolen.</p><p>“Oh my God!”</p><p>For the first time, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he was too conservative.</p><p>As expected, everyone went crazy after coming to the Abyss Island.</p><p>For the sake of resources, he even managed to provoke hundreds of stone giants. He simply didn’t know what kind of heaven-defying antics the initiator had done!</p><p>“In comparison, I’m so weak, right?”</p><p>“How could he achieve great things if he became so timid after he provoked a Void Attendant?”</p><p>“No, I can’t be reckless. I have my own code of conduct. How can I compare myself with others? This is not a good thing and not a good example for children.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou patted his chest and decided that since they weren’t here for him, he wouldn’t bother about them.</p><p>In any case, the more chaotic things were, the better it would be. Before he moved the Herb garden, his original intention was that the more chaotic the Forest of Miracles was, the more stuff he could have.</p><p>Wasn’t the current situation exactly what he wanted?</p><p>“It’s time to find the Void Attendant.”</p><p>“I’ve been here for so long, why hasn’t it come to me yet?”</p><p>“It’s too weak. I really don’t know how this guy managed to be the guardian of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer for so long.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned and felt that the Void Attendant’s reaction was a little too slow.</p><p>Could it be that he had only disappeared for a day, and it had offended some big Boss and was killed?</p><p>“It can’t be, it can’t be that bad.”</p><p>“The Void Attendant should still be quite invincible.”</p><p>When he thought about this, Xu Xiaoshou decided to retrieve the Void Suppression Stele first.</p><p>Before he stole the medicine, he had thrown the Void Suppression Stele away, a short distance from the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>Now, with Jiang Buyi’s face, he set out to search for the Void Attendant. In this case, it would be easier to meet the Void Attendant when he returned to its hometown.</p><p>It just so happened that the Void Suppression Stele was right there, so he could retrieve it in case he needed it.</p><p>“I’m trying to frame a dragon. I hope that the Void Attendant’s Spiritual light is still not as bright. I hope that it will conscientiously remember my ‘Jiang Buyi’s face’. If it can’t find me in the future, it will just hunt him down.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was excited. He quickened his pace and rushed to the original location of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>…</p><p>‘Er…er…er…er…er…”</p><p>Among the ruins, broken stones and messy wood scattered everywhere laid a stone stele that seemed to be unchanged since ancient times, and which could only make some er…er…er.. sounds.</p><p>“No one is here?” As the smoke and clouds dispersed, Xu Xiaoshou, who had transformed into the Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi, walked out of the space and murmured softly.</p><p>He had never obtained Jiang Buyi’s blood, nor had he seen Jiang Buyi’s style of attack. naturally, he could not use the ‘Imitator’ to mimic his moves.</p><p>Therefore, he only used the Morph Forms techniques that Jiang Buyi had used when he chased him under the Deep Sea. Combined with the abilities of all his attributes, he managed to imitate a little of his cloud attributes.</p><p>It was just an empty show of power, devoid of any attack power.</p><p>But when he thought about it, the Void Attendant would probably fall for it. After all, its brain wasn’t that good.</p><p>When he arrived at the Void Suppression Stele, this place was already very close to the site of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer. The Holy Emperor’s Dragon Scale heartbeat also began to accelerate.</p><p>He thought that the Void Attendant must have gone out to find him. Perhaps it had sensed the aura of the Spiritual Medicine and was searching for it.</p><p>“Why was there so much black liquid?”</p><p>As he squatted down in front of the croaking Void Suppression Stele, Xu Xiaoshou reached out and touched the thick black liquid.</p><p>The fact that the ‘Transformation’ in his body did not activate meant that the Void Attendant had not suddenly become smart and sprinkled poison on his Void Suppression Stele.</p><p>“There’s a slight smell of blood?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sniffed and felt that the black liquid was a bit like blood. Subconsciously, he frowned.</p><p>“Whose blood was black in color?”</p><p>He had seen golden blood on Holy Blood before.</p><p>“This black color was truly strange. Could it be that some non-human had fought here, lost their heads, and spilled their blood?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
