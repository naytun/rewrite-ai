He nodded and said, “You said it, ha ha.”</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, Xu Xiaoshou realized something, much to his shock.</p><p>He could not take back the five energy seeds that had been condensed!</p><p>A surge of power erupted in the air. Lightning and sparks were faintly visible within this destruction aura, as if they would explode in the next second.</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s face was solemn. She didn’t care about anything else and took the lead, “Withdraw your Godhood abilities.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had even used his Breathing Technique, but he found that his Sovereign Stage Breathing technique had reached a bottleneck for the first time.</p><p>He could slowly absorb the power of Sword Cognition and the Little Blue Flower of the Tranquil Lake.</p><p>However, it could not absorb even half of the other three Saint Stage powers at all!</p><p>“I-I can’t take it back.”</p><p>Beads of sweat seeped across Xu Xiaoshou’s forehead, and he was about to use his Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand to wipe his sweat. Fortunately, he discovered it in time and resisted the urge.</p><p>“You can’t take it back?” Lei Xi ‘er glared at him. “You can’t take back your own power?”</p><p>“Wasn’t this the result of the extreme compression? It’s beyond my control!” Xu Xiaoshou was also flustered. “Wasn’t this the same logic as conducting Alchemy? If I had perfect control over the Elixirs, why would there be a cauldron explosion?”</p><p>“If you can’t control it, why did you do all this?” Lei Xi ‘er felt her vision going dark.</p><p>“Since this move came out, I don’t intend to take it back,” Xu Xiaoshou said as if it was a matter of course. “The more unstable the power of an explosion is, the better it is. Why do I have to be able to control it before I create it?”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Lei Xi-er choked.</p><p>“What you said makes so much sense!”</p><p>Cursed. Passive Points: +1, +1,+1,+1…</p><p>“Bang Bang Bang!”</p><p>The area where the void shattered grew larger and larger, and more and more sweat beads appeared on Xu Xiaoshou’s forehead.</p><p>He was really about to lose control of the power in his right hand.</p><p>“You can’t throw it!”</p><p>Lei Xi-er saw Xu Xiaoshou’s intention and hurriedly stopped him.</p><p>This technique was too terrifying. His Yuan Mansion hadn’t even fully formed yet, he really couldn’t withstand it.</p><p>“If I can’t throw it away, what should I do?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. He felt that he could throw it away.</p><p>His Yuan Mansion had already evolved. It wasn’t so weak that it couldn’t even handle three Saint-Stage powers in the zone and two pseudo-Saint-Stage powers.</p><p>Perhaps it could, but the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer would definitely be affected.</p><p>Lei Xi-er looked down.</p><p>These were all Holy Medicines. Under the impact of the aftermath of the explosion, the entire medicine garden would probably be reduced to nothing.</p><p>As for throwing it far away…</p><p>Once the Saint-Stage powers combined and exploded, what would be considered a far distance?</p><p>Lei Xi-er and Xu Xiaoshou were completely ignorant of this.</p><p>Was the Yuan Mansion big?</p><p>Big!</p><p>However, to a Saint-Stage power, it was not explosive enough!</p><p>“Throw, throw it outside?” Lei Xi-er said after a moment of silence.</p><p>She suddenly felt that she had been corrupted. She had actually gotten used to this kind of mindset where she would put her own interest before others.</p><p>If the Yuan Mansion couldn’t handle this move of Xu Xiaoshou’s, then the Abyss Island definitely could. If it didn’t work, he could find a Void Attendant and throw it at its head so it could eat it… this should work, right?</p><p>“We won’t be able to leave the Yuan Mansion.” Xu Xiaoshou shook his head.</p><p>To exit the Yuan Mansion, one needed a Spatial Passageway. If he were to enter the Spatial Passageway with a nuclear bomb in his hand, wouldn’t the Spatial Passageway collapse in an instant and he would be lost in the Spatial Fragment?</p><p>“Then what should we do?” Lei Xi ‘er looked around, infuriated at Xu Xiaoshou’s constant antics in the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>“Damn!” Xu Xaoshou wiped his sweat with his other hand as his brain worked quickly. Suddenly, his eyes lit up and he said excitedly, “Greedy the Cat Spirit! Greedy the Cat Spirit has the Swallow Attribute.”</p><p>“Shut up!” Lei Xi-er rebuked him.</p><p>“How could Greedy the Cat Spirit withstand such a terrifying move?”</p><p>“Wouldn’t it be blown to pieces from inside out?”</p><p>Cursed. Passive Points: +1, +1,+1,+1…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stuck in a dilemma.</p><p>He felt that Lei Xi ‘er was overthinking things. He was just a tiny Master Stage. Even if he had broken through to the Star Worship State, he shouldn’t be able to destroy the entire Yuan Mansion with a single move.</p><p>But since the other party didn’t allow it, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t do anything.</p><p>“I can’t hold it any longer!”</p><p>“Look at me,” Lei Xi ‘er suddenly spoke, and a white Holy Power appeared on her body. At the same time, her God Devil Eyes began to spin at high speed. White mist dispersed from her left eye, and her entire body emitted a Godhood radiance, like a fairy from heaven.</p><p>“What are you doing? Don’t provoke my precious seeds.” Xu Xiaoshou panicked.</p><p>It was already very difficult for him to control the five powers. If Lei Xi-er were to interfere, he would not even be able to use the ‘Saint Seed on All Five Fingers’ and then there would be two more corpses here.</p><p>“I’ll use the power of Godhood to help you control your power. You throw them one by one, try to suppress the explosion as much as possible, and then throw them far away! Lei Xi ‘er gritted her teeth, and a white Reborn Lily bloomed beneath her.</p><p>With just a glance, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt his soul being cleansed and his mind cleared up. Even his control of the power over his opponent had improved a lot.</p><p>At this moment, he felt that the five precious seeds in his hand had quietened down.</p><p>As long as he wanted to, he could merge all five of them together and fulfill his dream and make them become one.</p><p>“Your God Devil Eyes have such an ability?” Xu Xiaoshou was surprised, and his voice became excessively overbearing. “I feel that the last step can be done. I can fuse them!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
