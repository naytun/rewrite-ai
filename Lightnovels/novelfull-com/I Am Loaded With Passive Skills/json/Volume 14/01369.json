It swallowed the Holy Power even though it did not know where it came from, which was actually absorbed from the Space Node, and tried to break free from its control after it swallowed it.</p><p>“The Holy Realm is like a spider web. If I step over it, even if I’m in the disappearing state, will I get stuck?”</p><p>“Or perhaps, even if he was not stuck and could escape, how could Jiang Buyi, the one who created the spider web, not be aware that the fish had escaped?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou exhaled heavily and suppressed the nervousness in his heart.</p><p>He clutched the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale and retreated back silently into the world there.</p><p>At this stage, he could only pray that Rao Yaoyao’s arrival would break the situation. With her identity as the ruler of the Red-clothed people, she could forcefully order Jiang Buyi to take back the Holy Realm.</p><p>But was this possible?</p><p>In the distance, Rao Yaoyao, who wore a green dress that showed off her snow-white shoulders, calmly floated down from the Nine Heavens after the Cang Godhood Sword landed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou calculated the distance. Rao Yaoyao had floated over from a hundred miles away.</p><p>In other words, she knew about the existence of the Holy Realm. However, she was not afraid of being discovered by Jiang Buyi. Therefore, she entered the battle directly.</p><p>If this was the case, she did not need to order Jiang Buyi to take back the Holy Realm even if she wanted to take Teng Shanhai away!</p><p>It was unrealistic to count on ‘accidents’ and ‘coincidences’!</p><p>“I’m done for…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou once again realized the power of a Demi-Saint.</p><p>This was a sense of despair that could render any Spiritual Cultivator below the Demi-Saint level powerless just by standing there. Perhaps only Teng Shanhai, who was still in the dark, had not felt it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind was a mess, but he quickly calmed down. The more critical the situation was, the more he needed to calm down.</p><p>“Jiang Buyi…”</p><p>“I really shouldn’t have provoked this guy. I’m only at the Master Stage.”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou calmed down, the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale also stopped its excessive pounding and its heartbeat began to slow down.</p><p>When he held this powerful danger foretelling treasure, Xu Xiaoshou felt a slight sense of security.</p><p>At a certain moment, Water Ghost’s face and what he had said in the Deep Sea suddenly flashed through his mind. It was related to the ‘Hand of Godhood’.</p><p>For a Master Stage Cultivation Level to participate in the Struggle for the Great Path was a matter of self-destruction. Only greed and ambition could support a Spiritual Cultivator in the next stage of growth.</p><p>It was due to these words that Xu Xiaoshou became overly ambitious and dared to plot against Jiang Buyi.</p><p>“And now I’m in a difficult situation.”</p><p>“Opportunity and danger coexist. A chess piece only needs to shine and show the chess player that he has the qualification to be the ‘Hand of Godhood’. The chess player will naturally step up to solve whatever problems that the chess piece cannot solve.”</p><p>In his current state, these words were simply absurd.</p><p>After all, in the Arena, only those from the Holy Divine Palace and the Jiang Clan were enemies.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was isolated and helpless, but he did not think what Water Ghost had said previously was unreasonable and that he was just trying to fool him.</p><p>He believed in Bazhun’an and knew that he also valued him greatly. They knew that he would cause trouble everywhere he went, so they would definitely have a trick or two up their sleeves for him as a way to solve his current predicament.</p><p>What could it be?</p><p>“Bazhun’an knew of my uniqueness and allowed me to act on my own, but he can’t just abandon me.”</p><p>“So, if I really encounter a situation that I can’t solve with my own ability, he should have made a move.”</p><p>“After all, Rao Yaoyao is not stupid. As long as I negotiate with Teng Shanhai and Jiang Buyi, no matter how stupid they are, they’ll know that I’ve played them and that I’m probably still hiding nearby, unable to escape.”</p><p>“But it’s impossible for Bazhun’an to come over now!”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou thought about it, he began to get agitated again. After all, the current situation was too special.</p><p>Calm down! Calm down!</p><p>He kept telling himself that he needed to stay calm.</p><p>His ‘Perception’ brought with it a powerful memory, and it began to search for the so-called ‘support’. Xu Xiaoshou quickly realized that because of his special nature, Bazhun’an wouldn’t be able to pay attention to him all the time and help him in time.</p><p>But he must have left something for him to make use of.</p><p>“Should I contact him?”</p><p>That’s right…</p><p>“Communication Bead!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took out his Communication Bead first and tried to contact Bazhun’an. Perhaps this guy was also on the Abyss Island now?</p><p>But he failed…</p><p>There was no response from the Communication Bead. The Abyss Island was in a world of its own and had no connection with the Shengshen continent.</p><p>“The Four Pillars of Destiny Token!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took out the Four Pillars of Destiny Token again and quickly injected his Spiritual Source.</p><p>“Save me, save me, I’m in danger now…”</p><p>He hid in the Disappearing State, held the Command Token, and in a low voice asked for help without a care about his image.</p><p>This wasn’t something to be ashamed of. It was just a way for the chess piece to take advantage of chess players in the game.</p><p>But it still failed…</p><p>The Four Pillars of Destiny Token obviously did not have a communication function.</p><p>“D*mn!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was anxious. He didn’t even dare to listen in on the conversation between the three people at the Arena. He felt that he would be discovered in the next second, and then he would be dragged out to be executed.</p><p>“What could it be? What could it be?”</p><p>As he scratched his head in a panic, Xu Xiaoshou wished he could split his head open to see if he had made any mistakes.</p><p>Suddenly, his thoughts settled and his eyes lit up.</p><p>“Yes, I still have one item that I have not used!”</p><p>With a flip of his hand, the two Spirit Talismans that Lei Shuangxing and Luo Leilei had risked their lives to bring from the Yunlun Mountains Range appeared in his hands. Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he had seen a lifeline.</p><p>At that time, the two of them didn’t clearly explain what the talismans could be used for.</p><p>However, with Bazhun’an’s abilities, he must have known that no one below the Demi-Saint Realm would let him fall into a dead end. Therefore, the intention behind getting Lei Shuangxing and the other person to bring the talismans must have been to deal with the current situation!</p><p>“Communication Talisman, Death Talisman”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered over the two Talismans whose functions he was not aware of and picked the Communication Talisman.</p><p>He didn’t think that the Death Talisman would work at this moment. Xu Xiaoshou would never believe that it could kill a Demi-Saint if he threw it out.</p><p>However, the Communication Talisman was different.</p><p>“Psychic? Or communication?”</p><p>“Let’s hope it’s psychic and can directly summon Bazhun’an out.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clasped his hands together and hurriedly injected his Spiritual Source into the Communication Talisman, only to discover that…</p><p>There was still no reaction!</p><p>“D*mn!”</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou broke down.</p><p>“Could it be that my deduction was wrong?”</p><p>Bazhun’an had really abandoned him and didn’t even leave a backup plan for him. Even in such a situation, he had to deal with it alone?</p><p>“I don’t believe it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were red, but he didn’t believe it.</p><p>He had even used the Holy Power of his Energy Reserve and poured it all into the Communication Talisman.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>The Communication Talisman quivered.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s hands trembled, and he was overjoyed.</p><p>It worked!</p><p>It really worked!</p><p>However…</p><p>“Why does this Communication Talisman need Holy Power to be activated? If I didn’t have the Holy Miracle Fruit, what would I have done?” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were wide open, and he began to curse in his heart.</p><p>However, on second thought, the only time he would think of using this Communication Talisman was when he still couldn’t defeat the enemy after taking the Holy Blood.</p><p>Or could it be that this Communication Talisman could be taken out to block the attack of the opponent’s Holy Power, and then be activated passively?</p><p>“D*mn it! What if I die if I have to go to such trouble to call someone?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless. He could only hope that the Communication Talisman would give him a stronger helping hand. If the Storyteller came alone, he was afraid that it would not be enough to deal with the current situation.</p><p>“Beep…”</p><p>The Communication Talisman trembled and made a slight beeping sound. It didn’t have any ‘communication’ or ‘spiritual’ functions. It just rang calmly like a signal transmitter.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt numb and began to look around.</p><p>There was no response yet. If this had been used in battle, it would be too late by the time any help came!</p><p>“Beep…”</p><p>However, the Communication Talisman continued to chime in this way. Other than that, no other strange phenomenon occurred.</p><p>“Still not done?” Xu Xiaoshou felt his teeth hurt. He held the Communication Talisman tightly and looked around anxiously.</p><p>When no one came, he could only turn his gaze back to the three people in the Arena.</p><p>After Rao Yaoyao entered the Arena, she had already contained the tense atmosphere between Jiang Buyi and Teng Shanhai. She turned sideways and stood in front of her own people. Her eyes narrowed as she looked at Jiang Buyi.</p><p>Before she could say anything more, Teng Shanhai saw that it was his own people who had come.</p><p>He excitedly pointed to the opposite side and shouted, “Rao Yaoyao, he’s Xu Xiaoshou! You and I will work together to kill him here. This time, we can’t let him escape!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
