The True King Of The Giant Kingdom! 2</h1><p>1303 Xu Xiaoshou, Who Had Unleashed All His Power! The True King Of The Giant Kingdom! 2</p><p>Up until this moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s physical strength was still unable to completely withstand Infernal Original Seed’s full strength.</p><p>However, he understood that…</p><p>At this moment, the reason why he could borrow Infernal Original Seed’s strength for a short period of time…was because of body tempering.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s fundamental reason for cultivating a sovereign physique was to be able to better withstand the various types of “Fire seed” of the infernal lineage.</p><p>At this moment, the Infernal Original Seed’s strength was indeed strong…</p><p>However, to deal with a higher void, this method was far from enough!</p><p>“Transformation!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou began to use transformation to raise his figure.</p><p>This passive skill reached the sovereign level during the Yunlun mountain range trial. As there were people watching the cloud realm world, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to test it.</p><p>However, on Abyss Island, he was unbridled!</p><p>“Bigger!”</p><p>“Bigger!”</p><p>“Bigger!”</p><p>“Transformation” of the master stage would be limited by the size of the human body. One wouldn’t be able to transform into a true giant or shrink into gravel or particles.</p><p>However, a sovereign-level “Transformation” was a qualitative transformation!</p><p>This was the first time Xu Xiaoshou had used the “Transformation” to its full power. In an instant, his figure and height, which had been a small ant, suddenly expanded.</p><p>One feet…</p><p>Three feet…</p><p>Ten Feet…</p><p>The two white skeleton giants, the void attendants, and even Lei Xi’er watched in astonishment as Xu Xiaoshou’s human form suddenly collapsed and transformed into a hundred-meter-tall giant that was three hundred feet tall.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was stunned.</p><p>When did Xu Xiaoshou master this ability?</p><p>Had he always been a giant?</p><p>“Suspected, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“It really works!”</p><p>As he felt the spiritual energy in his energy reserve rapidly decrease, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly came to enlightenment. The “Transformation” of the sovereign level really had no limit.</p><p>Or perhaps the only thing that could suppress his body from surpassing the void attendant was the spiritual source.</p><p>But…</p><p>300 feet was enough!</p><p>This body could contain even more explosive power of the Infernal Original Seed!</p><p>However, to destroy the higher void world, he had to kill Double Dumba*s in an instant…</p><p>He was just a little bit away!</p><p>Just a little bit!</p><p>“Berserk Giant, enter the arena!”</p><p>A beast roar sounded.</p><p>The 300 feet tall Xu Xiaoshou’s body expanded once more as the golden light descended, turning into a 300 feet large berserk giant!</p><p>The era of the 3-feet-tall giant had passed, and he was now a complete freak!</p><p>“Roar!!!”</p><p>This time, even the Infernal White Skeleton, Ember, and ice-blue White Skeleton, Ice, were stunned.</p><p>“Hehehe…”</p><p>Ember was excited. So its owner was really from the same race. If his owner was a little bigger, he would be able to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with it. It really didn’t want to poke him!</p><p>“Roar…”</p><p>Ice was also shocked and puzzled.</p><p>Could this really be done by a human? The owner had clearly never used such an ability before.</p><p>So he was really from the White Skeleton race?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou has evolved into Xu the Beast!”</p><p>The thousand feet large Berserk Giant, Xu Xiaoshou, was willing to call this form… Xu the Beast form! The true king of the giant kingdom!</p><p>As he felt his own strength rise to the limit, similarly, his energy reserve was in a frenzied state of depletion. Even the various passive skills were somewhat unable to be transformed.</p><p>Xu the Beast, who had used all his firepower, immediately shot a glance at all the double dumba*s that was a dozen miles away.</p><p>This distance was originally very long.</p><p>Now, however, the world had become smaller.</p><p>Xu the Beast felt that his palm could smash this small world into pieces!</p><p>“Infernal Heavens!”</p><p>The sound was settled.</p><p>“Sizzle~”</p><p>The Ice River world that had been constructed by the ice-blue White Skeleton, Ice, melted in an instant.</p><p>The temperature within a radius of 100 miles rose steadily. In the blink of an eye, it reached its limit. The compressed white flame emitted threads of fire from the cracks in the ground.</p><p>The space started to distort!</p><p>“Buzz…”</p><p>The void attendant, who had just swallowed the power of the ice crystals, felt his body turn cold. Suddenly, the surrounding environment changed again, as if he had entered the Ember Zone.</p><p>He couldn’t help but be surprised.</p><p>What was going on with this human?</p><p>His cultivation level was clearly so low, yet his body contained such terrifying power!</p><p>Not only could he become bigger, but he could also control all kinds of ridiculous energy attacks.</p><p>Forget about the extreme ice type, but how could this white flame be so similar to the Infernal White Flame in the Infernal White Flame Field?</p><p>The key was…</p><p>How could his body withstand it?</p><p>It wasn’t that he hadn’t seen the giant tribe’s void attendant before, but his physical body was just slightly stronger.</p><p>The power that this human had displayed consecutively… The void attendant felt that the demi-saint and holy emperor that he had seen before would rarely dare to combine these two opposing extreme ice and fire powers into one, right?</p><p>This sinner’s serial number was 800820…</p><p>A humanoid walking bomb core?</p><p>“Damn it, damn it, damn it!”</p><p>On the other side, while double dumba*s was running with all his might, his heartbeat also began to accelerate.</p><p>This was too crazy!</p><p>This was really too crazy!</p><p>It’s one thing for Xu Xiaoshou to be powerful from the outside, but to be able to affect the higher void world just by relying on the energy released from his body?</p><p>No matter how weak his ‘Higher Void World’ was, it was still a higher void level ability.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was only a grandmaster, yet he was able to burn through his higher void world with his own strength!</p><p>And…</p><p>“What’s going on with this pressure?”</p><p>Even though he was already 20 miles away, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t chase after him.</p><p>However, double dumba*s still felt that he was going to be taken down by that little master in the next second…</p><p>No!</p><p>It wasn’t a feeling!</p><p>At a certain moment, double dumba*s’s heart rate soared to its peak, and a soft murmur seemed to come from beside his ears…</p><p>“Ember, Dragon Melting Realm!”</p><p>A loud bang sounded.</p><p>In an instant, mountains and rivers were destroyed, and ancient forests were burned to the ground.</p><p>Within a radius of a hundred miles, a thick white flame that was like a barrier rose from the ground. It covered all directions without any blind spots as if a white blazing sun had descended into the world.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
