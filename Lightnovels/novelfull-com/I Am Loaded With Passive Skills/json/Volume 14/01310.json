Achoo! Achoo!”</p><p>On the road leading to the Forest of Miracles, Xu Xiaoshou kept sneezing.</p><p>“Did you catch a cold?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er glanced at the person in front who had mastered the Ice-Type Upanishad and couldn’t help but ask.</p><p>“Are you kidding me… I’m so strong, how can I catch a cold?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou woke up with snot in his nose. Sometimes, he was really tired of this Whim.</p><p>It was fine for his heartbeat to accelerate and to have palpitations was also fine. What was the point of sneezing all the time?</p><p>“If it was in a battle and I had such a Whim, wouldn’t I, the dignified Saint Servant, Xu Xiaoshou, die due to snot?”</p><p>“What’s going to happen then?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er looked at Xu Xiaoshou with slight disgust as he discarded his snot into the Ember Flame. She decided it was better not to look, so she turned her head and asked.</p><p>“Ho ho ho.”</p><p>Poor Ember Flame was too big, it did not know what the owner threw at it, but fortunately it didn’t eat it. Everything was burned cleanly in the fire.</p><p>“It’s just a very ordinary Whim…” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even turn his head and used some water to clean his hands.</p><p>Lei Xi’er was silent when she heard that. After a long time, she said, “This ordinary Whim of yours is a little unusual.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused. “Sometimes it’s hard to understand. I guess it’s because of the fight just now. It made too much noise and attracted people’s attention.”</p><p>“I told you not to fight like that,” Lei Xi’er muttered.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou spread his hands. “That was a Higher Void level. If I don’t show my trump card, can I stop him?”</p><p>“That won’t do either. It’s too ostentatious.”</p><p>“If it’s not ostentatious, can it be me, Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>This time, Lei Xi’er choked. After a long time, she said, “Didn’t you say all those here are guaranteed to be the Higher Void level? When someone comes, you will know how the word ‘death’ is spelt!”</p><p>“Hehe.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was fearless. He stood at Ember’s head, pointed at the land and stared at the ancient forest.</p><p>“It’s good to have more people. It’s more lively when there are more people.”</p><p>“It’s easy to kill a person if it’s a one-on-one fight as you fight with the body. You have to use your brains if you fight with many people.”</p><p>“What misfortunes are drawn to the East; the golden cicada escapes from its shell, then drives the tiger to swallow the wolf, borrows the knife to kill, and then watches the fire from the other side, stokes up the fire, and finally sits back and reaps the profit, the biggest winner… Is this a strategy that can be used for a one-on-one fight?”</p><p>“In a word, I can’t fight a one-on-one fight, but I’m the fierce thug in a one-on-many fight!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er: “…”</p><p>She couldn’t help but roll her eyes at Xu Xiaoshou. “What kind of weird imagination was that?”</p><p>“The battle hasn’t even started yet, and you’ve already taken a bystander’s attitude toward this?”</p><p>“The problem is, who will cooperate with you?”</p><p>“You don’t even know who will come. Do you think you’ll succeed?” Lei Xi’er’s tone was full of mockery. She felt that Xu Xiaoshou treated her as his Junior Sister and was bragging.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand indifferently. “Where did we see a person’s rehearsal? Who is so daring to let me personally rehearse with him? The stage of the Forest of Miracles is on a first come, first serve basis. As long as he dares to come, I can arrange it for him!”</p><p>“I’m waiting for something to happen to you!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was a little angry, but in the end, she was still worried. “Don’t forget, there’s still a Demi-Saint on the Abyss Island!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows and looked at Lei Xi’er, who looked angry and acted like a Junior Sister. He smiled and said, “But don’t forget, we still have a big bodyguard on the Abyss Island. One punch for each of our little friend.”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er looked around.</p><p>“Ice? Ember? Fourth Sword?”</p><p>Impossible, that was not enough to stop a Demi-saint!</p><p>“The Void Attendant.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pointed ahead. “It headed for that direction just now. I told you to keep it in mind, but you forgot so quickly? Could it be you have amnesia?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er: “…”</p><p>“Cursed, passive points + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>“Void Attendant, since when did it become your big bodyguard?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was speechless. This was clearly the next biggest enemy.</p><p>Because according to Xu Xiaoshou, the next step was to go to the Forest of Miracle’s Herb Garden of Divine Farmer to pick herbs.</p><p>Even the ‘treasure crisis’ that the Flame Python had pointed out needed to be moved back a little.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked ahead and could faintly smell an even stronger medicinal fragrance.</p><p>He chuckled aloud.</p><p>“Later.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
