He had also said that as long as the holy realm shrank, his location would be revealed.</p><p>In that case, whose life should I take to avoid further embarrassment?</p><p>Was this a valid problem?</p><p>“You son of a b*tch!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was so angry that his teeth hurt. So he couldn’t beat Master Siren and wanted to get back at him?</p><p>The Holy Emperor’s Dragon Scales were still beating wildly. At this moment, the information bar was no longer calm.</p><p>“Missed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Buzz off!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was flustered. His speculation was almost spot on, and now the word “Missed” ultimately proved his theory. Jiang Buyi was planning to take his life!</p><p>How?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not think of how Jiang Buyi was planning to take his life, so he could only think of a way to escape.</p><p>“I’m still in the disappearing state. The Holy Emperor Dragon Scale is only a warning. I still have some time to waste.”</p><p>“Should I remove the Vanishing Technique now and hide behind Master Siren?”</p><p>“No! That damn old thing is already determined to kill me and will attack first. I’m afraid Jiang Buyi will be able to take me down and kill me before Master Siren’s sword can help!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind was spinning.</p><p>Take the easy way out, coupled with the space attributes, and then take some medicine to run ten thousand miles away? ”</p><p>He looked up and saw that hundreds of thousands of miles were covered by Jiang Buyi’s immortal cloud body.</p><p>After running so far away, Jiang Buyi would catch him, but it was also inevitable that Mister Siren could not keep up with him!</p><p>In the current situation, if he ran far, he would die!</p><p>Only by staying in the battle could he possibly save his life.</p><p>“However, if I stay here and remove the Vanishing Technique, Jiang Buyi’s demi-saint will lock onto me faster than Master Siren. If I don’t, I’m just waiting for death. He’ll be able to lock on to me in the end.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clutched his head, almost going crazy.</p><p>There was no gap between the natural world and the disappeared world in his eyes, but at this moment, it had suddenly become a world of Yin and Yang, Heaven and Hell.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s “Perception” spread out, and his attention spread out from the battle. He saw two figures squatting under the spatial barrier in the distance. The dean and… who is that?</p><p>Behind them, there were hundreds of stone giants that did not dare to move forward, but they were ready to make a move.</p><p>There was another person in the arena other than Mei Siren and Jiang Buyi: the void attendant!</p><p>The holy realm had long been broken!</p><p>This big guy was still pretending. Its four limbs were wide open, struggling against the original wall of the holy realm, which was gone now, like an actor.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never seen a giant with such clumsy acting skills!</p><p>However, the void attendant was too cowardly. It did not dare to advance or retreat. It was afraid that if it moved or stayed still, it would attract the attention of the two warped beings in the battle.</p><p>Then, his life would be taken away.</p><p>As such, it could endure the aftershocks of the battle and persist until now, standing solidly in this forest of wolves!</p><p>“There are so many people, even giants, but Jiang Buyi did not pay attention.”</p><p>“This means that other than Mei Siren, his attention is only on me!”</p><p>“No! It’s not ‘me’; but Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at the void attendant’s clumsy acting. He looked at the dried black blood on the void attendant’s body. Then, suddenly, his pupils dilated, and the corners of his mouth curled up.</p><p>“Blood?”</p><p>He reached out his hand, and there were still traces of black blood on his fingertips.</p><p>This was the liquid he had obtained from the Void Suppression Stele when he met Teng Shanhai. He did not know what it was before, but now he understood.</p><p>The void attendant had started bleeding on the Void Suppression Stele!</p><p>His left arm wriggled and began to “transform.” Ultimately, his left arm turned into a person that looked precisely like Xu Xiaoshou. The two were tightly attached.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou endured the pain and cut apart this part of his body.</p><p>“The portrait clone cannot fool Jiang Buyi. I can only rely on you, my left hand!” Xu Xiaoshou solemnly pressed down on the “twin brother” that appeared after the transformation.</p><p>Blood is thicker than water!</p><p>I’m relying on you! You got to act well!</p><p>If we’re discovered, we’ll all die!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face twitched as he watched his original body’s severed left arm regenerate and heal quickly. The “twin brother” felt like he had been abandoned as a spare tire. Two lines of tears flowed, and he wanted to say something.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou reached out and covered his mouth, not giving him any chance. At the same time, his body grew more prominent and infinitely more significant…</p><p>Finally, he reached the critical point of a thousand feet. When he felt that his energy reserve could not hold on any longer, Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly turned to the imitator and wiped the remaining black blood on his fingertip.</p><p>“Roar!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
