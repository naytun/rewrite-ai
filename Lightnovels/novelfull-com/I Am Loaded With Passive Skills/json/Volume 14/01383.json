A life and death decision? Don’t I need to think?”</p><p>“When Bazhun’an wanted me in the White Cave, he didn’t even threaten me like this! You’re bullying me!”</p><p>In the disappearing state, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t hold it in and began to curse madly.</p><p>However, in the next second, he suddenly understood why Jiang Buyi had suddenly ended the conversation and asked him to make a choice. That was because…</p><p>“Beep… Beep… Beep…”</p><p>The sound of the Communication Talisman was still in an orderly manner, but at one moment, it emitted a faint light, and a guiding power was vaguely generated in Xu Xiaoshou’s mind, pointing him in a certain direction.</p><p>In Jiang Buyi’s holy realm, Xu Xiaoshou’s “Perception” was affected, and he could not see the outside world.</p><p>When he turned around, he saw a clear figure in the blurry world outside the holy realm.</p><p>That was an old man dressed in a light purple swordsman’s robe, holding a folding fan in his hand. He was so graceful and otherworldly.</p><p>Other than the two stone swords on his back that slightly affected his temperament, he was like a banished immortal. His entire body exuded the faint light of a Savior, like an angel descending.</p><p>“Master Siren?” Xu Xiaoshou was overjoyed.</p><p>He recognized this person. He was a guest of the First Pavilion in the Sky. After he failed to accept a disciple, he left the imperial city after the night battle. No one knew where he went.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never thought that at the most critical moment, he would appear outside Jiang Buyi’s holy realm with the Communication Talisman in his hand.</p><p>He was like a stabilizing force.</p><p>If he wasn’t a Savior, what was he?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said inwardly, “At this moment, Mei Siren, you’re my God!”</p><p>“No, is Master Siren qualified? Jiang Buyi is a demi-saint…” Xu Xiaoshou quickly calmed down, but his heart began to beat wildly.</p><p>“No, no, so what if he’s a demi-saint? Master Siren is one of the most experienced Seven Sword Deities. With his talent, he would have become a demi-saint long ago. Why had he waited until now?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of the conversation he had with Master Siren that night and tried to comfort himself. “He just doesn’t want to become a Saint now, but it doesn’t mean he can’t fight against a demi-saint!”</p><p>After finding an excuse for himself and knowing that he had finally called over someone, Xu Xiaoshou was no longer humble.</p><p>He controlled the portrait clone, which only had half of its body left, to meet Jiang Buyi’s gaze.</p><p>He said in a loud voice, “Demi-Saint Jiang, as a junior, I respect you, so I spoke with respect just now.”</p><p>“But you have to know that even when Bazhun’an invited me to become a Saint Servant, they didn’t threaten me like this!”</p><p>Half of his body floated up into the air, and with a wave of his sleeve, his voice was filled with anger, “I won’t easily die, and I’m never born to bend my back!”</p><p>“Swish…”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Jiang Buyi raised his eyes. With a flash of light in his eyes, Xu Xiaoshou’s portrait clone was broken at the waist and turned into spiritual energy.</p><p>“It’s a pity that you’ve made a wrong decision…”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s eyes were filled with killing intent. He wanted to attack immediately, but suddenly, he turned to look into the distance as if he had understood something.</p><p>“I was wondering what made you suddenly speak so firmly. So it’s because you saw this person outside the bounded domain, right?”</p><p>Then there was a clatter.</p><p>A hundred miles away, everything in the world seemed to slow down.</p><p>The light footsteps entered the holy realm, but they were heard by Jiang Buyi and Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“You’re looking down on me with your words, Demi-Saint Jiang…”</p><p>Accompanied by a low laugh, Mei Siren gently waved his paper fan. His footsteps were neither fast nor slow. He used his skills to shorten the distance, and in just three steps, he arrived in front of Jiang Buyi.</p><p>He smiled and faced Jiang Buyi, who was filled with killing intent. They looked at each other. He did not release any Holy Power, but his aura was not at all inferior.</p><p>Standing still, Mei Siren closed his folding fan and tapped his palm. He asked with a smile, “Demi-Saint Jiang, even I don’t have the right to make people feel at ease?”</p><p>“Master Siren, save me…”</p><p>In the disappearing state, Xu Xiaoshou was about to cry.</p><p>Master Siren was too strong. He could be called the most handsome man in this battle!</p><p>Now, unless Bazhun’an personally appeared, Xu Xiaoshou felt that the strongest person in his heart would have to be replaced.</p><p>Mei Siren, with the posture of a Sword Deity, fought against a demi-saint and did not fall into a disadvantage.</p><p>This kind of nonchalant attitude was completely incomparable to the void attendant, who had been instantly killed by a single punch, or Teng Shanhai, who had his chest pierced by a palm.</p><p>They were all in the higher void level, but the difference between them was huge.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know the combat strength ranking of the Seven Sword Deity before, but now he understood.</p><p>Among the great voids and Sword Deities, Bazhun’an and Mei Siren belonged to a level of their own. And below them were people like Gou Wuyue and Rao Yaoyao. As for the void attendant and Teng Shanhai, they were ranked even lower.</p><p>And below these, the true “higher void experts” could be ranked, such as Double Dumba*s, Hong Dang, Little Ninja, and other insignificant figures.</p><p>With one’s own strength, one could forcibly open up a “realm” called each name between the realm of the demi-saint and the higher void. This was an expert! This was the peak!</p><p>However, in the holy realm, just as Xu Xiaoshou thought that he was about to be saved, Jiang Buyi’s eyes turned cold, and his aura suddenly changed.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The demi-saint Jiang Buyi merely squinted his eyes and condensed his killing intent. But the space within a hundred miles collapsed, and everything was renewed.</p><p>Nine Heavens seemed to have fallen into a cold abyss, and the scenery changed.</p><p>Heavy snow began to fall, and the bone-chilling wind seemed to freeze all Spiritual Cultivators below the demi-saint level to death.</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou, who had disappeared, could not help but shiver. His scalp was numb as if he had been electrocuted. He felt that even though he was in a different time and space, he was affected.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
