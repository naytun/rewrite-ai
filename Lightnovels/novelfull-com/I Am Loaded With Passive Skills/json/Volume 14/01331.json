They were only a small part of the Nine Great Ancestral Trees.</p><p>Instead, this was the true body of the Nine Great Ancestral Trees, the true body of the Dragon Apricot!</p><p>“It’s said that when the dragon ancestor of the ten ancient ancestors died, he was too powerful and caused the surrounding area to become one of the Seven Breaks’ restrictions, the Dragon Cave.”</p><p>“And all of its power after it fell was absorbed by this Dragon Apricot.”</p><p>“Or rather, the Dragon Apricot became a Dragon Apricot because it absorbed so much of the dragon ancestor’s power. From ordinary, it became extraordinary!”</p><p>“Later on, this so-called ‘Dragon Apricot’ became the tree of worship for the Dragon Clan in the Dragon Cave.”</p><p>“Each of its plums will become the ‘blessing of the Dragon God’ and be given to the best of the Dragon Clan to cleanse their bloodline and obtain stronger dragon power.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er walked around the Dragon Apricot, and all kinds of information flashed through her mind.</p><p>However, she fell silent as she looked at the hundreds of apricot seeds on the Dragon Apricot.</p><p>“How? How is this possible…”</p><p>“Didn’t they say that the apricots on Dragon Apricot are very difficult to bear?”</p><p>“Also, shouldn’t this Dragon Apricot be worshipped by all the dragons in the Dragon Cave? Why is it in the center of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer?”</p><p>“Why is this happening?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er held her head and looked at the Dragon Apricot silently. She felt that the world was full of absurdity.</p><p>This move by Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>The main body of the Nine Great Ancestral Trees, Dragon Apricot, had entered his Yuan Mansion?</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>Just as she was deep in thought, the passageway to the World of Yuan Mansion opened, and Xu Xiaoshou entered.</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit was the first to discover it. Its eyes lit up, and it flew into the arms of the recipient on the spot.</p><p>“Swish swish~”</p><p>It kept licking Xu Xiaoshou’s face, trying to please him.</p><p>“Meow, meow, meow~”</p><p>“Master, master, I’m sick, please let me take the medicine~”</p><p>“Move away.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou threw away the little white cat and looked at the herb garden. He couldn’t help but laugh.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>In a flash, he landed beside Lei Xi’er.</p><p>“Sob sob!”</p><p>Outside the barrier, Greedy the Cat Spirit helplessly drew circles of curses with his claws.</p><p>Damn it, with a new love, he forgot about his old love meow meow meow meow meow…</p><p>“How is it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou landed and swept his hand over the herb garden. He held his head high and stuck out his chest, looking like he was going to say, “This is the Empire that I have fought for you.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er looked at the man in front of her and found that there was no blood on his body. After a long time, she said,</p><p>“A little bit?”</p><p>“Ha.” Xu xiaoshou laughed, “For such a huge Abyss Island, isn’t a small Herb Garden of Divine Farmer just a ‘little bit’?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was speechless.</p><p>So, his ambition was to empty the entire Abyss Island?</p><p>It appeared that she was too narrow-minded.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points: +1,+1,+1,+1”</p><p>“Lei Xi’er,” Xu Xiaoshou said as he looked at the herb garden. He suddenly became serious and said, “This medicinal garden is big enough, right?”</p><p>“Huh?” Lei Xi-er’s beautiful eyes looked over, not knowing why he asked this.</p><p>“Under the heavens, there is no other world that is larger than my Yuan Mansion, nor is there any world that has more spiritual herbs.” Xu Xiaoshou smiled. “Don’t you like to grow flowers and trees? There are so many spiritual herbs here. It’s enough for you to take care of for a lifetime.”</p><p>A lifetime?</p><p>Lei Xi’er was slightly startled, and then her eyes narrowed as she asked, “Xu Xiaoshou, what are you trying to say?”</p><p>Xu xiaoshou took a deep breath and said seriously, “Lei Xi’er, stay here and become a little gardener in the Yuan Mansion. You should like this place more than I do.”</p><p>He would always remember what his little Junior Sister had said to him when she had recovered to this state.</p><p>After this trip to the Yunlun Mountain Range, she would leave.</p><p>Where to?</p><p>Revenge.</p><p>On Lei Xi’er’s shoulders, she would always carry the weight of “revenge”. Even if she spent her free time in the Yuan Mansion, planting flowers and trees, she would never forget the tragedy of the Lei family.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou used to think.</p><p>Was little Junior Sister really not coming back?</p><p>If he let Lei Xi’er absorb a large amount of life force, would it trigger the ‘Infant transformation’ mechanism and make that innocent and naive Junior Sister come back?</p><p>However, the reality was that no matter what, since Lei Xi’er had come out, it was impossible for her to take the initiative to go back.</p><p>Since little Junior Sister was a “consciousness” born from her self-protection mechanism when she was a child, in the end, the two were also of the same origin.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou would never forget how happy Mu Zixi had been before she had the identity of Lei Xi’er.</p><p>Now, if he could not make Lei Xi’er take the initiative to leave and let Mu Zixi appear, would the two consciousnesses merge and become one after he avenged her?</p><p>A single Mu Zixi was not complete, and a single Lei Xi ‘er was also not complete!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already understood that when Lei Xi’er could also have the innocence of Mu Zixi, then this person would be considered complete!</p><p>“You, stay here.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pointed at the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer and said, “I’ll help you take revenge!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er listened silently, her beautiful eyes staring at Xu Xiaoshou without blinking.</p><p>She had thought about how Xu Xiaoshou would show off to her when he came in after emptying the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer. He would tell her all about the wonderful process of the matter and how smart he was.</p><p>She also thought that she had to maintain her cool this time and she couldn’t give Xu Xiaoshou a word of praise and let this person become even more arrogant.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
