Moreover, he almost knelt.</p><p>The holy realm that had sealed off the world suddenly crumbled in the distance. A red plum blossom bloomed, and then Mo Sword turned into Green River Sword Boardline, crushing the Holy Light that descended from the sky.</p><p>In the next second, after the Holy Light, a Saint Statue stood in the air, and the Holy Light turned into the Hands of Saint Judge!</p><p>Without the demi-saint’s aura that had been sealed off by the holy realm, Ye Xiaotian could still feel chills down his spine and his heart racing even though he was far away.</p><p>“Is the demi-saint going all out?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was shocked. He wondered if the Eldest Senior Brother of the Fringe Moon Immortal City could withstand such a force for Ten Aura.</p><p>In the whole world, only a demi-saint could fight a demi-saint!</p><p>Even the real Seven Sword Deity would be helpless against such saintly might! Let alone a rising star, Xiao Kongtong, who hadn’t even obtained the title of Seven Sword Deity?</p><p>However, in the next second, just as Ye Xiaotian was about to give up all hope, a monster with no holy power but a will that was even more powerful than a saint’s pressure stood in front of the Saint Statue. The giant figure suddenly appeared!</p><p>The monster didn’t make any move other than rising, but the Hands of Saint Judge falling from the sky were directly shattered!</p><p>“Holy…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was dumbfounded as he stared at the scene in the distance.</p><p>That Saint Martial Arts was shattered by a virtual image?</p><p>Without Holy Power and Holy Energy, it was just an illusion, right? An image that even a cultivator from the great void could manifest!</p><p>However, this virtual image…</p><p>How come it didn’t seem virtual but even more real than a Saint Statue?</p><p>“What the hell is this?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian glanced at the person behind him in a daze. He could not understand what was happening, but he was greatly shocked. He could only associate the monster’s intimidating Sword Will with ancient swordsmen.</p><p>“This is the first level of Heart Sword Technique, Present Gods and Buddhas,” Xiao Kongtong swallowed saliva hard and replied with difficulty.</p><p>“Present Gods and Buddhas?” Ye Xiaotian was still dumbfounded.</p><p>He had heard of this before, and he had even seen Bazhun’an use it when he was peeking at Eighth Palace War. It was this move that had killed seven hundred white-clothed people and shattered Gou Wuyue’s will.</p><p>However, even the image that Bazhun’an had visualized was not as shocking as the monster in the distance now!</p><p>“Who manifested the Present Gods and Buddhas?” Ye Xiaotian was nervous. It wouldn’t be a big deal if it was from their allies, or it would be complicated.</p><p>He couldn’t imagine.</p><p>If there was such a monster among the enemies, he felt that there was no need to save Xu Xiaoshou. They’d better run away while there was still time, and maybe they would still be alive.</p><p>“The caster isn’t our enemy!” Xiao Kongtong knew what Ye Xiaotian was thinking and said excitedly, “It’s Master Siren’s Present Gods and Buddhas!”</p><p>Master Siren?</p><p>Ye Xiaotian could not react to the title for a moment.</p><p>Very quickly, someone came to his mind… Seven Sword Deity, Mei Siren.</p><p>“It’s the senior of ancient swordsmen?”</p><p>“Yes, that’s him!”</p><p>Xiao Yingying clutched the sack on his shoulder tightly and said in a thrilled tone, “I once mentioned that Master Siren’s will might be stronger than mine.”</p><p>“Master Siren is devoted to education. As a teacher, he reviews what he knows every day, so he is also improving all the time.”</p><p>“He has truly embodied the idea of loving his enemies and living in Way of the Sword.”</p><p>“Do you see it? This is what Master Siren’s inner world looks like, and this is the real him…”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong pointed at the monster in the distance with a smile, and his eyes lightened up when he talked about swords.</p><p>“Colorful illusionary clothes, nine in number, body full of worldly affairs, watching the decay of love. Ghosts resist the tower and worship it, carrying the peerless green sword in their palm. Qiongqi was nurtured in its heart, while its body was as dispirited as old wood. The four Seas are full of consciousness and will. How can I let others know?”</p><p>As the Eldest Senior Brother of Fringe Moon Immortal City, he was now tugging at Ye Xiaotian’s sleeve like a child seeing his favorite toy.</p><p>“This is it! This was what I was talking about! Ye Xiaotian, did you see that? Did you see that?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was dumbfounded for a while and didn’t know what to say.</p><p>“I saw it.” He gently moved Xiao Kongtong’s hands away. “But, what are you talking about? I don’t understand a word…”</p><p>“Dumba*s!” Xiao Kongtong started to curse. “You are not a real cultivator! How can you not understand anything? Oh my…”</p><p>At this moment, he wished he could have made everyone from Fringe Moon Immortal City come over and show them what Present Gods and Buddhas looked like!</p><p>“It’s called Nine Major Sword Techniques! Are you blind? You might not be at that level yet, but you should know this, right?” Xiao Xuanji was so angry that he even forgot to respect his teacher.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian did not mind. After all, power talked, and he was indeed no match for Ye Xiaotian at his current stage.</p><p>After the brief explanation, he glanced at the monster in the distance again and finally realized what the strange words that Xiao Kongtong had said just now meant.</p><p>Not to mention, he knew about Nine Major Sword Techniques.</p><p>Looking at that giant figure again, he could really see the features.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
