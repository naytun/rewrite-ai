I don’t care about this thing!” Ye Xiaotian was exasperated.</p><p>“I’ve already said that there’s no reason for me to take back the gift I’ve given you. You can just accept it with peace of mind. What’s the meaning of returning a gift that came from a thousand miles away?” Xiao Kongtong, who was disguised as Bazhun’an was also a little irritated from being pursued. “Can’t you change your route? Why do you have to keep following me?”</p><p>“The problem is, why did the stone giants that you lured here follow me? You’re clearly trying to make me bear the Fire Power for you!”</p><p>“That’s the way it is. Was it wrong to give you a ‘Semi-Saint person’ and let you bear some Fire Power? Opportunities come with risks!” Xiao Kongtong said as if it was a matter of course.</p><p>“To hell with your ‘Opportunity with risk’!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>After getting the ‘Semi-Saint person’, he was chased by hundreds of stone giants.</p><p>These things looked even bigger than the Void Attendants of the First Hall of Sins. If even Bazhun’an had to run away from them, Ye Xiaotian would not be so stupid as to stop and exchange blows with these stone giants.</p><p>To be honest, Ye Xiaotian had also tried to run elsewhere while he was fleeing.</p><p>He felt lucky, the stone giants chased after Bazhun’an for the Semi-Saint person, right?</p><p>However, it was clear that his luck had run out.</p><p>As soon as they parted ways, most of the hundreds of stone giants chased after him in the direction he had fled to. Ye Xiaotian was so frightened that he hurriedly changed his route and followed after Bazhun’an.</p><p>Even a fool would know which to choose between traveling alone and having a companion!</p><p>“Besides, you’ve given me a hot potato. You can’t just leave and let me bear everything on my own, that’s too immoral!’</p><p>Ye Xiaotian rejoiced. It was only because he had the Space Attributes that he was able to run for such a long time and had the ability to track his way back to Bazhun’an if anything went wrong. This allowed him to share the Fire Power of the battle he would have to face alone.</p><p>If it had been anyone else, they would have been tricked to death by now!</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong, who was in front, panted heavily. He suddenly came to a halt and stretched out his hand as he stopped in front of an ancient messy forest.</p><p>“Hehe, Bazhun’an, I really didn’t think that you would be reduced to such a sorry state one day. You even used the Space-Time Transition to run for your life. This really opened my eyes.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian followed suit and stopped right behind him. He was furious, but he also glanced behind him with a lingering fear.</p><p>It was clearly empty there, but he knew that it would only take a moment for the hundreds of stone giants to locate them and they would soon break through the space and follow him.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong did not have the time to fuss over Ye Xiaotian’s rude attitude toward his teacher.</p><p>This ‘dog skin plaster’ who could not be shaken off, no matter how rude he was, had a purpose that happened to coincide with his.</p><p>Live on!</p><p>“It seemed a great battle took place here. Perhaps our chance has come?” He turned to look at Ye Xiaotian with a smile.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian scanned the area with his Spiritual Senses and realized that this was the Forest of Miracles, the center of the storm that he had seen through the Spatial Mirror in the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>“How did it become like this?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was shocked by the chaos. He had been on the run for less than a day, and yet, the vast Forest of Miracles had been reduced to such a miserable state?</p><p>Broken pieces of wood were scattered all over the ground, and it was extremely dilapidated and messy.</p><p>It was as if the ‘Forest of Miracles’ had become the ‘ruins of the Forest of Miracles’.”</p><p>“A fight between Demi-Saints?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s eyebrows shot up as he recalled the Demi-Saint he had seen in the mirror world but did not dare to look at.</p><p>He did not believe that any Demi-Saint would dare to make a move on the Abyss Island.</p><p>However, if it were the Higher Void level, its combat power should not be so strong that they could create such an upheaval and destroyed most of the Forest of Miracles in one battle.</p><p>“Could it be Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian thought of the second possibility.</p><p>Other than a Demi-Saint, there was only one person in the entire world who could turn the Forest of Miracles into a pile of shit in a day.</p><p>“There’s a Demi-Saint here?” Xiao Kongtong was startled at first, but then his attention was diverted to something else. “Is Xu Xiaoshou here too?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian glanced at him and recalled the relationship between Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou and the first-in-command Saint Servant Bazhun’an. Then he nodded and said, “Yes, I’ve seen Xu Xiaoshou with my Spatial Power. He’s in one of the herb gardens here.”</p><p>“Oh, by the way,” he paused and added, ” There’s indeed a Demi-Saint nearby. He’s not a native species of the Abyss Island, but a Spiritual Cultivator from the Shengshen Continent.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong sized up this white-haired youth and could not help but sigh in his heart. “The Space Attributes were really useful.”</p><p>With this kind of understanding of the overall situation, there was no need to worry about the arrangements and just bury the stone giants here?</p><p>“It’s time we turned the situation around!” Xiao Kongtong had a look of determination.</p><p>“You have a plan?” Ye Xiaotian, who was afraid of being chased by the stone giants, said in surprise and joy.</p><p>“Ha.” Xiao Kongtong laughed and waved his hand. “Just based on this point, you’ve lost to your disciple, Xu Xiaoshou. He could deal with so many factions and can even beat a rapid retreat. He passed through the green bushes without even being brushed by a single leaf.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian snorted coldly. “You’re still mocking me at a time like this?”</p><p>However, his life was more important now, and Ye Xiaotian did not care about that. He said, “So, what’s your plan?”</p><p>“I don’t have a plan,” Xiao Yingying shook his head directly.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was speechless.</p><p>“Then, what are you trying to say here!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
