Furthermore, it was such an unexpected person!</p><p>“Mei Siren, do you know how your position will change after you get involved in this matter?” Jiang Buyi sneered.</p><p>“It’s just that I’ll become a Saint Servant,” Mei Siren thought.</p><p>He smiled, understanding everything in his heart.</p><p>In fact, he should have announced his position to the world a long time ago, perhaps after he saved Xu Xiaoshou in the night battle in Dongtianwang City.</p><p>But at that time, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t need him to do anything, so Mei Siren only felt that the time was a little late, but it didn’t matter.</p><p>“Whoosh, whoosh…”</p><p>The cold wind pierced into his robe.</p><p>The anger of a demi-saint brought about a change of all things, which could crush an ordinary higher void.</p><p>However, Mei Siren still stood straight like a javelin. He did not even tremble.</p><p>“I have my own plans, so there’s no need for you to worry about me, Demi-Saint Jiang. However, this guy in front of you…” He glanced around but couldn’t find Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>If not for the Communication Talisman in his pocket, Mei Siren would have thought that Xu Xiaoshou had already sneaked away. Facing the demi-saint’s pressure, Mei Siren chuckled and said, “I want to take him away. Would you agree for my sake, Demi-Saint Jiang?”</p><p>“Huh!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi snorted coldly. With a boom, the ground beneath Mei Siren collapsed and sank a few feet.</p><p>“What do you think?”</p><p>That terrifying demi-saint’s pressure appeared along with the deep voice. Jiang Buyi had not even made a move, but even Xu Xiaoshou, who was in a disappearing state, could not help but step back in shock.</p><p>This aura was even more terrifying than when he was facing Teng Shanhai!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Jiang Buyi’s front in a daze.</p><p>The hundred-mile holy realm presented two distinctly different views.</p><p>The cold winter brought by Jiang Buyi had affected the entire holy realm, but he stood still because this was his home ground.</p><p>However, with just a glance, except for the position occupied by Mei Siren remaining unchanged, the earth behind him crumbled and collapsed, much shorter than the opposite side.</p><p>This was a huge blow in terms of aura!</p><p>But at this moment, Xu Xiaoshou could still see a withered branch stubbornly sticking its head out of the cracks in the rocks from the ground that had been crushed by the demi-saint’s pressure.</p><p>In the cold winter, a new green spot emerged and turned into a dark red plum flower, which then bloomed.</p><p>“What…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes widened.</p><p>He could feel that this red plum flower contained a strong will that was not weaker than that of the demi-saint Jiang Buyi.</p><p>“Demi-saint’s Power?”</p><p>“No! There’s no Holy Power fluctuation at all. Is this just the will of Master Siren?”</p><p>“But Master Siren hasn’t even broken through to the demi-saint realm. How can he change the weather and the way of the world in the holy realm of a demi-saint?”</p><p>On one side was Jiang Buyi, who was standing on the ground with a cold and solemn face.</p><p>On the other side was Mei Siren, who was still standing on the only stone pillar that remained unchanged in the collapsed earth.</p><p>Tit for tat!</p><p>They fought as equals!</p><p>“But one is a demi-saint, and the other is a Sword Deity in the higher void level!”</p><p>“Even Rao Yaoyao couldn’t take a single move of Jiang Buyi. Master Siren is only a Seven Sword Deity like her…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared blankly at the two sides, who were equally matched, and then glanced at Mei Siren, who had become even more arrogant because of the collapse of the earth. He only felt a surge of heroic spirit in his heart, and he did not know how to describe it.</p><p>He thought, “Shouldn’t we be like this?”</p><p>Just like plum blossoms, the colder the wind, the stronger the fragrance.</p><p>Jiang Buyi finally saw the true combat strength of this well-known Master Siren. With a look of praise, he slowly said, “So, you’ve touched the Holy Path and will be a Saint soon?”</p><p>Mei Siren seemed to be vague in the face of a demi-saint, but he was actually vigilant.</p><p>When he heard this question, he tapped his paper fan and answered with a smile, “Becoming a demi-saint is just a thought. Freedom is what I’ve been seeking my whole life.”</p><p>These words seemed to have touched Jiang Buyi’s sore spot. He closed his eyes, and his hair and beard fluttered in the wind. His posture became even more arrogant as he said angrily, “However, as long as you don’t become a Saint, you won’t be able to defeat me!”</p><p>There was no nonsense.</p><p>After finishing speaking, Jiang Buyi raised his hand in anger. The Saint Statue conjured by the demi-saint’s will behind him rose up again and almost towered into the sky.</p><p>“This is the Saint Statue that destroyed Teng Shanhai’s physical, spiritual, and will senses…” Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils shrank as if he could see the miserable state of Mei Siren being destroyed by this move.</p><p>Even Rao Yaoyao, who was holding the Cang Godhood Sword, could not resist Jiang Buyi’s Holy Light of Saints!</p><p>Sure enough, in the towering statue, a semi-saint person embedded in the forehead of the Saint Statue burst out endless Holy Power under Jiang Buyi’s summoning.</p><p>At that moment, Jiang Buyi did not seem to care whether the ultimate attribute of the Forest of Miracles would be stimulated even more by his full-power attack.</p><p>All the Demi-saint’s Power was gathered!</p><p>A beam of Holy Light fell from the sky!</p><p>Holy Light of Saints!</p><p>He did not hold back. Jiang Buyi felt that as long as a demi-saint did not face a demi-saint, he would not show any mercy.</p><p>As long as one was below the semi-saint level, regardless of whether he was a Spiritual Cultivator or a swordsman, it would be considered blasphemy if he dared disobey the semi-saint’s will.</p><p>Blasphemer deserved to die!</p><p>Holy Light of Saints fell from the sky at an extreme speed and was so powerful that it made people go crazy.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even dare to get close, afraid that he would be killed in one move in the disappearing state.</p><p>As he retreated, he even wanted to throw out a portrait clone to remind Master Siren that Teng Shanhai had died under this move.</p><p>The higher void could not even be resisted!</p><p>The power of Demon God was destroyed!</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>However, Mei Siren, who was standing on the trembling earth pillars, only raised his eyes to look up and then looked away.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, watch carefully,” Mei Siren muttered.</p><p>He knew Xu Xiaoshou was still here and had not left.</p><p>He also knew that he was not only here to save this guy but also to take in a disciple and teach him the sword.</p><p>If a teacher who had not been acknowledged was defeated in front of his students in the first battle, how could he, Mei Siren, teach his student the sword?</p><p>The demi-saint…</p><p>So what if the other party was a demi-saint?</p><p>“Holy Power isn’t invincible. If a Spiritual Cultivator didn’t become a Saint through the path of the Upanishad, he could only control one Holy Path.”</p><p>“However, what we have learned as swordsmen are Nine Major Sword Techniques, Eighteen Sword Forms, and three thousand kinds of Ways of the Sword, which include countless attributes and the changes of the five elements in the heaven and earth. All of them are in my heart.”</p><p>“Even if I don’t enter the Saint realm, I can still blaspheme a Saint!”</p><p>The first few sentences of Mei Siren were still acceptable because it was like he was explaining to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>However, the more he spoke, the more profound his words became. It actually drew out the Way of the Heavens of the Abyss Island, which was difficult for ordinary people to touch. It turned into Saint Language that reverberated between heaven and earth.</p><p>He was clearly a mortal.</p><p>However, at this moment, Master Siren, with the posture of a Sword Deity, spoke the Saint Language and wanted to fight a demi-saint!</p><p>After finishing speaking, he raised his right hand in the air. With a hum, the world froze, the snow froze, and even time and space stopped moving.</p><p>In the disappearing state, Xu Xiaoshou’s face was filled with endless confusion.</p><p>He seemed to have understood the meaning of Mei Siren’s words.</p><p>But was this real?</p><p>In the face of the demi-saint Jiang Buyi’s attack, Mei Siren did not want to dodge, defend, or disperse the force. He actually wanted to fight against it with his sword.</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he had returned to Eighth Palace, back to the time when Elder Sang suddenly appeared in front of him and told Yu Lingdi without any explanation that there were three ways to resolve the Upanishad.</p><p>He became nervous. He only hoped that Master Siren would not go too far this time and get him involved.</p><p>Words were spoken at the right time, but the situation of the battle would always change in an instant.</p><p>Mei Siren only took a glance at the Holy Light of Saints that could even destroy the power of Demon God and stopped it in midair.</p><p>Even Jiang Buyi felt like he was in a dream. However, he could feel the changes in the Path Principles around him. For some reason, they were filled with the strong smell of time and space.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s eyes flickered. “Space and time attributes, what all Spiritual Cultivators dream of…”</p><p>Way of the Sword indeed included thousands of things as expected.</p><p>Mei Siren made his move.</p><p>He pinched his fingers, and the red plum that had grown in the deep pit instantly flew into his palm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
