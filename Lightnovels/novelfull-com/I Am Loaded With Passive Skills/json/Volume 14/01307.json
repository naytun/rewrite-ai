He hummed and replied,</p><p>“Void Crystal can be used to assist in cultivation or you can go to First Hall of Sins to exchange for the survival resources of Abyss Island.”</p><p>First Hall of Sins?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tilted his head. He remembered that Lei Xi’er had mentioned this place.</p><p>“I only mentioned it, but I don’t know what First Hall of Sins looks like and what resources can be exchanged for.” Lei Xi’er looked over, and Xu Xiaoshou understood.</p><p>“May I ask, Lord Void Attendant, what survival resources does the Hall of Sins have that can be exchanged for?”</p><p>“A lot.”</p><p>“Like what?”</p><p>“Like the ‘Death Exemption Order’, which can allow you to avoid death once.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned when he heard this.</p><p>Avoid death…</p><p>Was this saying that the person who was a sinner of Abyss Island could be exempted from the death penalty?</p><p>There were some things, but not many.</p><p>“What else?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stuck his head out and asked again. He felt that the void attendant’s words were too much.</p><p>If no one pushed it, he would not give out anything. If they pushed a little, he would only give out a little. If you stopped, he would stop as well… He did not know how to keep a conversation going at all, nor did he tell him some of the problems of Abyss Island. How annoying.</p><p>“For example, a ‘free pass’. A pass that will allow one to enter a restricted area.”</p><p>The void attendant did reply to his question, however, his answer was not very helpful.</p><p>“What else?”</p><p>“There’s also… all sorts of treasures. You’ll know when you find the Hall of Sins. There’s an introduction there.”</p><p>The void attendant stopped again. At the same time, he impatiently rejected all of Xu Xiaoshou’s subsequent questions and said, “Mission over. I should return to the land of protection.”</p><p>“UH…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had indeed never come into contact with such a super giant before, so he could only wave his hand and bid farewell. “Then, goodbye.”</p><p>The void attendant stood high above them, crossed his arms, and said mockingly, “You don’t want to see me again.”</p><p>Then, with a rumble, he took a long step and left.</p><p>“But we’ll see each other again…” Xu Xiaoshou looked in the direction he left, but he muttered silently.</p><p>“What did you say?” Lei Xi’er tilted her head and looked over.</p><p>“Nothing.” Xu Xiaoshou pointed at the void attendant’s back and said, “Remember, this back, this road.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er looked in the same direction.</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“Remember it, Big Baby!”</p><p>“Big Baby? What do you mean?”</p><p>“Have you seen 10,000 kinds of holy medicine similar to the Holy Miracle Fruit?” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes suddenly became fervent as he stared at Lei Xi’er, who had an exquisite little face.</p><p>“…” Lei Xi’er took a step back and really wanted to touch Xu Xiaoshou’s forehead. Was he daydreaming or did he have a fever?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held the cat and waved it around.</p><p>“I’ve seen it before!”</p><p>“One Piece was real!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
