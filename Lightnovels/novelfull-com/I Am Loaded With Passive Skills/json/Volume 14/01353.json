How did you come to this conclusion?”</p><p>“It’s a long story. Ye Xiaotian had no intention of explaining at all. However, the fact that we can’t find Xu Xiaoshou means that he’s safe at the moment.”</p><p>The spatial image flashed, and it showed a frenzied Void Attendant running frantically through the forest, as if it was searching for something.</p><p>Even though it was always careful not to cause any damage, its huge body still caused broken wood to fly about at each site it passed.</p><p>“Void Attendant!” Xiao Kongtong’s expression turned serious. He was clearly aware of the terrifying Combat strength of this Abyss Island’s native giant.</p><p>When he saw this, Ye Xiaotian was even more certain of the object of the Void Attendant’s search. The person was definitely Xu Xiaoshu!</p><p>This big mess…</p><p>“It’s really your style of doing things, Xu Xiaoshu!”</p><p>“I inexplicably obtained a Semi-Saint person and was chased by hundreds of stone giants.”</p><p>“You, on the other hand, were able to anger a Void Attendant on the Abyss Island and destroy the Forest of Miracles like this on your own.”</p><p>“Wait a minute!”</p><p>“The Forest of Miracles and the herb garden?”</p><p>“If I’m not mistaken, this should be the Forest of Miracles.”</p><p>“In that case, the medicine garden in the Forest of Miracles that had been emptied by Xu Xiaoshou probably, possibly, could not be the legendary Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, right?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s eyes widened at this possibility.</p><p>At this moment, he recollected all the knowledge he had learned about the Abyss Island in the Holy Palace. He felt that what Xu Xiaoshou had done would have incurred the wrath of heaven and the resentment of men!</p><p>If he had really emptied the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, then it was absolutely impossible that there would only be one Void Attendant chasing after him.</p><p>“This guy, is he crazy?”</p><p>“Didn’t he know that the commotion he caused would likely be even greater than the hundreds of stone giants chasing after him and Bazhun’an?”</p><p>“It’s over, it’s over…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s fingers trembled as he touched the spatial image. He was shocked by his own guess. He prayed that things would not develop in that direction and fervently hoped that his guess was wrong.</p><p>“Bang Bang Bang!”</p><p>The void in the distance behind him shattered and the stone giants were about to appear.</p><p>Time was running out.</p><p>“You’re looking for someone!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong patted the white-haired youth’s head in confusion. ‘What the hell? Are you sick in the head to be so scared by these two spatial images?”</p><p>“So, where is Xu Xiaoshou?” he asked urgently.</p><p>“I hope that Xu Xiaoshou’s figure will never appear on my Spatial Mirror. Ye Xiaotian looked behind him with a heavy heart. He then looked back at the Spatial Mirror and felt as if he was being attacked from both sides.</p><p>He swiped with his finger and the two images in front of him disappeared at the same time and was replaced by a new one.</p><p>He froze at what he saw.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s entire body tensed up, his scalp tingled, and his eyes widened in shock.</p><p>Even Xiao Kongtong inched closer in disbelief. Then, he immediately looked away and dared not take another look.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>Just a second before the figure in the Spatial Mirror turned around, Ye Xiaotian hurriedly stopped his ability and shattered the image.</p><p>“What did I just see?” Xiao Kongtong gulped, unable to believe what he had just seen.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was equally shocked. “If I’m not wrong, it should be two Demi-Saints?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong slapped the white-haired youth. Ye Xiaotian clutched his face and grimaced in pain. However, the two of them had a tacit understanding not to dwell on such a small matter.</p><p>“I’m not dreaming!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong tightened the sack on his shoulder, even more shocked.</p><p>“So, Ye Xiaotian, can you explain why there were two identical Demi-Saints in your spatial image, and why were they both in this forest?”</p><p>“Wait, could there be an error in the image?”</p><p>“The image can’t be wrong!” Ye Xiaotian’s lips twitched and he felt as if the world was turning absurd. “Perhaps, the two Demi-Saints are twins?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
