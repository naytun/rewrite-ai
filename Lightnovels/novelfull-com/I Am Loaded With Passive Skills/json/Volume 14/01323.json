He didn’t care about the others.</p><p>She then looked in the direction of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>Until now, there was still no news of the third person inside.</p><p>However, it was conceivable that as long as Xu Xiaoshou touched the Holy Medicine, the Void Attendant would definitely sense it. At that time, would it continue to pursue Hong Dang, or would it immediately return to the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer?</p><p>Lei Xi-er couldn’t help but hug Greedy the White Cat Spirit tightly. Her eyes were filled with deep worry.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, how many will you pick?”</p><p>“One, two? Or one or two batches?”</p><p>“Please, please, please, remember to stop while you’re ahead!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Mine! Mine! They’re all mine!”</p><p>“100% of this, I want it all!”</p><p>In the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, Xu Xaoshou’s eyes were red. After holding back for so long, he had finally gone crazy.</p><p>Hong Dang had indeed lured the Void Attendant out. This was exactly the same as the Medicine-picking process of the Double Dumba*s that he had gleaned from his Soul Reading!</p><p>There was no deviation from the plan!</p><p>“It’s flawless!”</p><p>“Brother Hong Dang has left, and the Guardian has gone after him.”</p><p>“There’s no outsider in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer now. The Holy Medicine and weeds are all mine!”</p><p>The last time he moved a third or fourth- grade Spiritual Medicine field from the White Cave, Xu Xiaoshou regarded it as a treasure and didn’t even allow Greedy the Cat Spirit to learn the art of Conducting Alchemy.</p><p>This time, it had been directly upgraded to a Holy Medicine. How could Xu Xiaoshu Shao hold back?</p><p>He calculated the time and suppressed his excitement, as he looked at it for a full 10 breaths of time.</p><p>Thinking that the Void Attendant and Hong Dang should have gone far away by now, Xu Xiaoshou decisively dispelled the Vanishing Technique and landed beside the Holy Miracle Fruit Tree.</p><p>This was not the one that Hong Dang and Double Dumba*s had picked from. It was a species that was located further in, and still had seven Holy Miracle Fruits!</p><p>“If I pick it up and eat it, I’ll be able to become a Master Stage with Holy Power.”</p><p>“From now on, when I battle with a Higher Void level, as long as he doesn’t consume any Holy Blood, it will be like the Void Attendant battling with Double Dumba*s and Hong Dang. It’ll be as easy as blowing off dust!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s Adam’s apple bobbed as he gulped. He stretched his demonic hands toward the Holy Miracle Tree and and reached for the roots of the Tree.</p><p>“Possessed by the flower monk! I’m going to uproot it! I will plant them in the Yuan Mansion and nurture some Demi-Saints!”</p><p>“Wahahahaha!”</p><p>“No, you can’t laugh, you can’t laugh!”</p><p>“It’s easy to get into trouble if I’m too arrogant. I’m like a devil villain now.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held his breath and stopped smiling. He grabbed the tree trunk with both hands and was about to exert some force.</p><p>At this moment, the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale’s heartbeat suddenly increased from a slight beat to an accelerated rate, just like when he faced the Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi in the Deep Sea.</p><p>“Bang Bang! Bang Bang! Bang Bang!”</p><p>“Received shock. Passive value,+1.”</p><p>A pop-up window appeared in the information bar, and the red-eyed Xu Xiaoshou calmed down a little.</p><p>“Was there danger lurking about?”</p><p>He immediately abandoned the idea of ‘Uprooting the Willow’.</p><p>As expected, the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale’s heartbeat returned to normal.</p><p>“Will the Void Attendant sense it if I touch the Holy Medicine?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned and reached for the Holy Miracle Fruit. He didn’t pick it, but just as he was about to pick it up…</p><p>“Bang Bang! Bang Bang! Bang Bang!”</p><p>The Holy Emperor Dragon Scales started beating so quickly that it was clear that he would definitely die if he picked up the fruit.</p><p>“Dammit!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was furious.</p><p>“The cooked duck was right in front of his mouth, it didn’t fly away and he couldn’t even eat it?”</p><p>He swept his gaze across the entire Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>“It’s too small, the layout is too small.”</p><p>“It’s impossible to give up. Since there’s only one chance to make a move, then…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered for a moment, before opening up the Spatial Passageway to the Yuan Mansion. It began to expand and continuously expanded widely.</p><p>“I’ll state a number, once only. Move this Herb Garden of Divine Farmer in one go!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
