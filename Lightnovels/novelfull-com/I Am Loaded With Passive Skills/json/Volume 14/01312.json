With a solemn expression, she watched the blackened Xu Xiaoshou rush up to her and hand over the equally black Elixirs.</p><p>“For me?” She pursed her red lips and had a defiant look on her face.</p><p>“Of course it’s for you. What Saint Refining Pills would I need? I have the Breathing Technique…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paused and explained, “Well, it means that my Cultivation is very powerful. I can eat the Holy Miracle Fruit even without the Saint Refining Pill. I might even be able to release some of the medicinal efficacy.”</p><p>“I. . .” Lei Xi’er’s lips twitched and she glanced at the blackened Elixirs. “Can it really be eaten?”</p><p>“You don’t believe me?”</p><p>“I don’t believe you.”</p><p>“It’s right that you don’t believe. After you’ve eaten this Elixir, then you’ll believe me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stretched out his hand and grabbed the blackened Elixirs. Without any further explanation, he stuffed the Elixirs into Lei Xi’er’s palm and even left some dust on her palm.</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s God Devil Eyes stared at her hand that had suddenly become so dirty. She wanted to use the power of Purification, but she couldn’t. She wanted to rub it on Xu Xiaoshou’s body, but she was afraid of the pain…</p><p>She could only fetch water and as she washed her hands, she asked hesitantly, “Can I not eat it?”</p><p>“Don’t worry. Your Senior Brother would not be so heartless as to use you as the subject for his first experiment.” Xu Xiaoshou chuckled. His gaze moved down and landed on the little fat cat.</p><p>“Meow?”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit’s little head tilted. It didn’t understand what it meant.</p><p>“Little guy, that was the process of Conducting Alchemy for fourth-grade Elixirs just now. Did you remember it at all?” Xu Xiaoshou asked kindly.</p><p>“Meow”</p><p>Greedy the Cat spirit nodded. It was indeed interested in Conducting Alchemy.</p><p>At the current stage, Innate Stage and Grand Master Level Elixir Master had quite a high success rate after 007’s work. It felt that it was time for this Conducting Alchemy cat to break through the Sovereign Stage.</p><p>“It’s good that you remember it. If you have time in the future, you can use any high-grade Spiritual Medicine in the Yuan Mansion World. You can try this fourth- grade Elixir.”</p><p>“It’s much simpler than the other fourth-grade Elixirs. If you really succeed in Conducting Alchemy, I’ll lend you the Alchemist Badge of a fourth-grade Elixir master to wear.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took out his Alchemist Badge and waved it.</p><p>“Meow Meow”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit drooled instantly.</p><p>It didn’t care about the badge, but previously, its owner was in charge of the high-grade Spiritual Medicine field in the Yuan Mansion World, so he didn’t want to let it go to waste.</p><p>“Now, what kind of Bodhisattva’s spirit had been activated in him, that he became so kind?”</p><p>“But there is one condition.” Xu Xiaoshou’s words suddenly took a twist.</p><p>“Meow?” Greedy the Cat Spirit had a human-like expression. As expected…</p><p>“Well, I won’t say it’s a condition, it’s a bit unpleasant to hear…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou flipped his hand and took out a blackened Elixir and in an extremely seductive devilish tone, he said, “It’s like this. Unfortunately, as your owner, I just happened to have two Elixirs, so now you’re in for a treat. You can have a taste of this Saint Refining Pill first!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er: “? ? ? ?”</p><p>Her beautiful eyes widened in disbelief when she heard this.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you’re crazy!”</p><p>“You failed to trick me? Now you chose to trick the Cat Spirit?”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit also had a question mark on his face.</p><p>“These blackened Elixirs are even worse than the ones i refined. Do you really think that I’m still the ignorant Conducting Alchemy fellow from my past life?”</p><p>“It’s very delicious!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sensed that Greedy the Cat Spirit was showing signs of disobedience. He quickly grabbed the scruff of its neck and picked it up. “Come, open your mouth, ah!”</p><p>“Meow Meow Meow! ! !”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit resisted violently. Its four short legs scrabbled helplessly in the air, but it could not break free from the shackles of fate. It even looked at its mistress in fear.</p><p>“Meow Meow Meow!”</p><p>“Help, help, someone is trying to poison little meow meow!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er could not bear it and tried to dissuade him. “Little Greedy the Cat Spirit is so cute…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes swished over. “There are only two Saint Refining Pills. If it won’t eat them, then you eat them.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er : “…”</p><p>In the end, under Greedy the Cat Spirit’s helpless gaze, she turned her face away slightly.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Greedy the Cat Spirit. In the future, when I manage the medicinal fields, I’ll let you have ten percent of the Spiritual Medicine. I definitely won’t tell Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>“Meow! Meow! Meow!”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit went berserk. The white fur all over its body stood up, and at this moment, it resembled a hedgehog.</p><p>However, no matter how much it tried it couldn’t use its hedgehog spines to prick Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Good boy, stop struggling. This is a fourth-grade Elixir. I won’t even let anyone who sucks up to me try it,” Xu Xiaoshou said with a chuckle. “Do you know that you’re like me when I had my first injection when I was young…”</p><p>“Meow! awooo! !”</p><p>“I won’t! ! !”</p><p>“Open your mouth.”</p><p>“Awooo!”</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>“Awooo! ! !”</p><p>“Are you rebelling? It’s all for your own good.” Xu Xiaoshou finally revealed his savage devilish nature. He pried open Greedy the Cat Spirit’s mouth and was about to force the Saint Refining Pill into its mouth.</p><p>Lei Xi’er looked at this scene in shock and felt extremely terrified.</p><p>Fortunately, Xu Xiaoshou would not treat his Junior Sister like this…</p><p>“Roar! ! !”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit’s cry suddenly changed. At this moment, its body squirmed and actually showed signs of becoming bigger.</p><p>“What the hell?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. “Greedy the Cat Spirit still had a battle form?”</p><p>“But this battle form, the way it appeared seemed a bit ridiculous?”</p><p>“Shrink your size immediately!”</p><p>He immediately used his big hand to grip Greedy the Cat Spirit’s head firmly.</p><p>Poor Greedy the Cat Spirit’s body swelled up into a ball, but the transformation of his head did not succeed. In the end, like a deflated ball, it reverted to its original state. He could only let Xu Xiaoshou feed the Elixir to him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
