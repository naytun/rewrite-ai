The Aura around his body transformed, and his figure slowly floated into the air.</p><p>He placed his hands behind his waist. In a flash, the monster on his back seemed to be summoned and twisted, rushing into his body.</p><p>The oppressive feeling the monster brought disappeared as soon as it disappeared.</p><p>However, something happened the next second.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>The sound of metal clashing rang out incessantly, and everyone could hear the sword singing.</p><p>At this moment, Mei Siren had recalled Present Gods and Buddhas.</p><p>He raised his foot and stepped on Yama. With a flip of his hand, the green light entered his palm without a sword.</p><p>As soon as he opened his eyes, the nine swords formed an array around him, and the chaos of the mortal world appeared. Everything began to chant in unison like kids in school studying before sunrise.</p><p>Wherever his gaze landed, the scenery within a radius of ten thousand miles would change. It was grotesque and variegated. Broken wood and floating rocks were used as swords, and ten thousand swords were worshipping, returning to the sect as one.</p><p>Present Gods and Buddhas in front of him had disappeared, but Mei Siren was now the true body of the monster!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Before he could make a move, the ground beneath Jiang Buyi’s feet crumbled and forced him to retreat.</p><p>Mei Siren’s move of pulling back the monster and displaying their momentum had destroyed even the only place where the other side could stand. They could only step into the black hole of space and were inexplicably shocked.</p><p>“What…” Jiang Buyi was stunned.</p><p>Nobody knew who represented Dao in this world.</p><p>At this moment, in Jiang Buyi and Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes, they had the answer. The respreentor was Mei Siren!</p><p>Mei Siren, who had collected all the unusual phenomena of Present Gods and Buddhas in front of them, had all the traces of the Nine Major Sword Techniques on their bodies. They were like the embodiment of Dao, with extraordinary postures, as if they were about to become Saints.</p><p>However, even though he had the power to become a Saint, he still had no holy will on him!</p><p>“What’s a sword saint?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou touched his forehead, and goosebumps crawled down his body. He had never seen such a scene in his life.</p><p>He couldn’t believe what he was seeing, but he understood that Mei Siren, in this state, had already surpassed the level of Sword Deity and the higher void.</p><p>Mei Siren wasn’t called a sword saint, for he didn’t want to despite his ability.</p><p>However, there was a problem.</p><p>If he refused to be called a sword saint, who else dared to use this title in the future?</p><p>On the battlefield, Mei Siren almost lost control of his aura.</p><p>After all, this was the first time he had used an unfamiliar ability. Unless he had no other choice, he seriously did not want to fight back.</p><p>However, swordsmen would never give up!</p><p>Jiang Buyi had already attacked him twice, so he could fight back with aura to avoid the third one, right?</p><p>“It’s called sword image.”</p><p>Mei Siren said with a slight frown as he tried his best to control his aura and observed the phenomena on his body.</p><p>He felt that his sword image went against his “teacher” public image, for he didn’t use to keep a high profile. That was why he chose the name to keep the balance.</p><p>Even so, his cold Sword Will forced Jiang Buyi to use his Holy Power to protect himself and retreat hundreds of miles away.</p><p>Now, even a small part of the Forest of Miracles within a radius of ten thousand miles had become Mei Siren’s holy realm.</p><p>He had not become a saint yet, but he had already controlled this land. Although Jiang Buyi retreated, it wouldn’t help too much.</p><p>Mei Siren was also very helpless.</p><p>The sword image was too strong, and he couldn’t do as he pleased, so he could only let it show its edge.</p><p>Retracting his gaze and looking forward, Mei Siren smiled and said, “Demi-Saint Jiang, I still stand by my words. Do I have the right to ask you to stop as respect for each other?”</p><p>“The sword image…” Jiang Buyi’s slightly hidden eyes flickered with a cold light. He did not want to quit at all, but what could he gain after fighting in this situation?</p><p>Just as Teng Shanhai humiliated a Saint before, Mei Siren spoke respectfully, but the demi-saint found him disrespectful and acted like a savage!</p><p>A saint could not be humiliated or disgraced!</p><p>Jiang Buyi had been forced to retreat a hundred miles. If he turned around and left, what would other demi-saints think of him?</p><p>“There’s a saying from Saint Servant, ‘if you don’t become a saint, you’ll be a servant forever.” Jiang Buyi’s face was cold as he said with an emotionless tone.</p><p>Mei Siren sighed and understood his choice. “I am not able to stay in this state for long, so I can only make three strikes at most. Demi-Saint Jiang, if you want to try, then go for it,” he sighed and said.</p><p>“You should have been the one retreating from the beginning!” Jiang Buyi shouted, and the Saint Statue manifested again. This time, it was not the Saint Statue that made a move, but it became part of him, just like what had happened to Mei Siren.</p><p>For a moment, demi-saint Jiang Buyi’s body glowed with holy light and turned into a colorful cloud. His momentum reversed and tore apart more than half of Mei Siren’s illusionary sword domain.</p><p>A storm was born, and a calamity descended.</p><p>Even though Xu Xiaoshou was in a disappearing state, he was in great pain, as if a monster was roaring and rampaging in his head.</p><p>When two top cultivators fought against each other, others could get caught in the crossfire.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou kept stepping back and even activated Close-bounds Force Field to relieve pressure and pain, but his knees were still trembling. There was no way for him to take this kind of power.</p><p>Mei Siren still didn’t want to fight and was still trying to talk the demi-saint out of it.</p><p>“This is the debut of my sword image, so I can’t control the power. However, I am sure that…”</p><p>“It will hurt or even kill you, but I don’t know what will happen.”</p><p>His expression was grave, and there were worries in his eyes.</p><p>“Are you sure about this?”</p><p>If the demi-saint didn’t die, he would.</p><p>If the demi-Saint died, it would be more troublesome.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
