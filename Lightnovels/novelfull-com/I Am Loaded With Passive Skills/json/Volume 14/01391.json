Even bards called Bazhun’an the second in Songs of the Ten High Nobles, which showed their ranks.</p><p>Without a doubt, after the ten Supremes, Penetrating Divine Senses was on fire.</p><p>Kui Leihan’s God Punishment Tribulation was considered the first generation’s Penetrating Divine Senses. To commemorate this heroic feat that transcended the era, any techniques inspired by God Punishment Tribulation in the later generations were all classified as Penetrating Divine Senses 2.0.</p><p>As a senior, Mei Siren naturally hadn’t lowered his status to participate in the younger generation’s War of the Ten High Nobles, so he had never seen the first generation of Penetrating Divine Senses.</p><p>What he was showing now was only a self-deduction based on the concept of Penetrating Divine Senses.</p><p>It could be called Penetrating Divine Senses 2.0, but Mei Siren didn’t dare to claim it belonged to the category of Penetrating Divine Senses.</p><p>Whoever invented this technique had the authority.</p><p>He knew he had to discuss it with Kui Leihan and gain his approval first to have his technique recognized. Only then could he gain a proper reputation.</p><p>However, Mei Siren didn’t care about vanity.</p><p>He only knew that this move combined the Way of the Sword, psychokinesis, and will. The original heart that was manifested by Present Gods and Buddhas was as magnificent as Holy Power and even greater.</p><p>“What makes Penetrating Divine Senses so powerful?</p><p>It was the way for those Spiritual Cultivators below the demi-saint level to have a chance to defeat the Saints!</p><p>The Saints here referred to Holy Emperors.</p><p>“When God Punishment Tribulation first appeared, it didn’t reach this level.”</p><p>However, this road had just been developed at that time, so it was normal that it didn’t exist. What everyone saw was its bright future.</p><p>After a few decades, no one could tell what cultivation level and combat strength the creator of the first generation of Penetrating Divine Senses.</p><p>Perhaps he had broken through to the demi-saint realm, perfected this path, and fought against a Holy Emperor. That was to say, the way to Saints was paved for the Spiritual Cultivation Era.</p><p>Perhaps he had suppressed his cultivation level in the higher void level to research this path. However, decades later, no one could say for sure whether the higher void’s power could be compared to demi-saints, Holy Emperors, and even the original God Punishment Tribulation.</p><p>This was even more terrifying than the former!</p><p>This was because it was possible to say that a demi-saint who broke through with such a foundation was unrivaled among the demi-saints, but it was not an exaggeration to say that he could be one of the peaks once he became a saint.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was so jealous of Mei Siren that his eyes turned red.</p><p>When Penetrating Divine Senses first appeared, he had already seen the future of this path and was one of the first who studied this technique.</p><p>Unfortunately, just like most people …</p><p>For decades, laymen like them could only watch Bazhun’an, You Yuan Buddha, and other geniuses of the era successfully activate Penetrating Divine Senses 2.0, the sword cognition, the power of will, and so on.</p><p>On the other hand, he had achieved none of them.</p><p>He had accomplished nothing!</p><p>Just when he thought that the elders’ thinking was rigid and couldn’t keep up with the latest power of the next generation, a guy about the same age as him made Penetrating Divine Senses 2.0 come true.</p><p>“If I can’t make it, nobody else should.”</p><p>“I can’t accept that I can’t achieve this goal, but an old man of the same generation as me has mastered it secretly! ”</p><p>Jiang Buyi could feel the will of the Mei Siren that was beyond the Saint Stage.</p><p>Before Present Gods and Buddhas appeared, this old swordsman was just a mortal below the demi-saint level in his eyes. In the eyes of a demi-saint, those below Saint Stage were still ordinary no matter how long they had cultivated!</p><p>However, this man’s will alone had surpassed his.</p><p>It was apparent that once Mei Siren obtained the position of a semi-saint person, he would definitely be conferred the title of Saint!</p><p>It could be difficult for Mei Siren to join the aristocratic family of the Holy Emperor and become a Holy Emperor, but he still had more chances than Jiang Buyi, who might never climb up to this position!</p><p>“What… what is this technique called?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi tried to hide his jealousy, for he knew the technique Mei Siren was practicing wasn’t like Lei Family’s Eyes, which he could take it away as he pleased.</p><p>“it didn’t have a name because it’s its debut.”</p><p>Mei Siren smiled, but his words revealed how stressed he was facing a Saint.</p><p>He hadn’t used this power for so many years, but he had to activate it to intimidate and counterattack to save Xu Xiaoshou from a demi-saint’s hands.</p><p>Since this technique made its debut today, it should have a name.</p><p>Mei Si was still standing on the pillar, and he had not moved his feet since the demi-saint had arrived. After muttering to himself, he twirled his fingers and pondered.</p><p>“Bazhun’an controls this generation, and he named his Penetrating Divine Senses 2.0 with his swords and will. That’s why it’s called sword cognition, which shows his confidence.”</p><p>“I only felt that the junior was full of himself in the beginning, so I started to research this technique. Alas, now I know why he’s the GOAT.”</p><p>“The next generation will eventually replace old men like us, and I have to admit that some people are indeed talented. They are decades ahead of swordsmen with poor aptitudes, so Bazhun’an did have the right to call it sword cognition.”</p><p>“I cannot!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
