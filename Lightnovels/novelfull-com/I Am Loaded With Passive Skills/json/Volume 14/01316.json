A New Storm Had Appeared… 3</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong blocked the Demon God’s great spear with one palm, but he was knocked to the ground instantly.</p><p>This spear was heavier than he had imagined. It could kill a Higher Void level with one strike and send a Demi-Saint flying.</p><p>Abyss Island was indeed worthy of being the land of opportunity created by his Teacher. There were treasures everywhere.</p><p>It was a pity that…</p><p>These treasures seemed to require one’s life in exchange for them!</p><p>“Since I’m taking them, it should be safe.”</p><p>The crystal gem couldn’t be put back, so Xiao Kongtong didn’t resist any longer.</p><p>“If I have to face them all, I’ll take the Semi-Saint Person, and I’ll also take this valuable Demon God’s Great Spear!</p><p>He tried his best to hold on, but he could not bear the weight of the Demon God’s Great Spear. In the end, he could only use the Sword Soaring Technique to exert some slight control over the Demon God’s Great Spear, which caused it to float in the air.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>“If I don’t run now, I, Xiao Kongtong, will die in this Sleeping Valley!”</p><p>With a sack on his shoulder and a gemstone in his hand, he now had a crooked and quivering Demon God’s Spear on his back.</p><p>In the dark cave, Xiao Kongtong heard the rumbling sounds outside and suddenly calmed down.</p><p>His eyelids drooped and blocked his vision.</p><p>At this moment, he looked like a stone statue of Buddha, who had pity for all sentient beings.</p><p>“Hum”</p><p>The turbulent Sword Will began to surge out of his small body like a wave, which caused the cave to vibrate and gravel to roll about.</p><p>“The will of the heart, the will of the heart…”</p><p>“The will of the heart, the will of God and Buddha…”</p><p>Bang, Bang, Bang!</p><p>The falling rocks smashed down, and the cave started to collapse.</p><p>“With this non existent sword, my fantasies will come true…”</p><p>“Be mindful of God and Buddha, and destroy the demons and dogs…”</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Even though there was no sword, a series of Sword Cries resounded from Xiao Kongtong’s body.</p><p>In the next second, a spot of golden light bloomed in the cave, and a three-hundred-meter-tall golden Buddha statue with its eyes closed, appeared slowly behind Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>Its curled up body slowly relaxed.</p><p>He also opened his tightly shut eyes!</p><p>“Heart Sword Technique, under the eyes of God and Buddha!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s eyes opened and a dazzling golden light cascaded from his eyes like a waterfall.</p><p>With a boom, the cave was shattered by the Phantom Buddha who stood behind him. The darkness was dispelled and the light was restored.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The cave was destroyed, and Xiao Kongtong could see the roaring world outside.</p><p>However, after a glance, his aura froze, and he was obviously stunned.</p><p>What he saw before his eyes…</p><p>The Giant-like mountains disappeared, and the huge broken swords buried in the Sleeping Valley had also disappeared.</p><p>In their place stood stone Giants, who towered into the clouds!</p><p>“One, two, three…”</p><p>“There were three to four hundred stone Giants, right?”</p><p>“So, there really are only sleeping Giants left in the Sleeping Valley, and not fallen Giants?”</p><p>“One hundred feet in size, three hundred feet in size, one thousand feet in size…”</p><p>All the stone Giants who had stood up after draining the power of the Hundred Thousand Mountains in the Sleeping Valley held broken swords and halberds in their hands. Their eyes were bloodshot as they charged toward Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>“What the…!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s heart stopped beating at this moment.</p><p>He was strong.</p><p>Strong enough to rule an entire world, build nine cities in a row, and create another Holy Land for Ancient Swordsman. He was known as the eldest Senior Brother of Fringe Moon Immortal City and even…</p><p>The Ninth Sword Deity!</p><p>But facing this group of stone Giants with bloodshot eyes…</p><p>“Just look at that thousand feet tall Giant!”</p><p>Because it charged forward too rapidly, its legs broke!</p><p>But after a roll, its broken legs repaired itself and it looked even more powerful than before.</p><p>This was obviously a monster that couldn’t be killed!</p><p>Xiao Kongtong had thought that fear was one thing, but no matter what happened outside, the Heart Sword technique and the Great Buddha Chop could easily sweep it away.</p><p>But now…</p><p>“What the hell am I fighting for? I’ve poked the Giants’ Nest, haven’t I?”</p><p>“I should run as fast as I can!”</p><p>The 300-feet-tall virtual image of the Golden Buddha behind him was just a little brother in front of these hundreds of stone Giants.</p><p>The shortest among these giants was twice as tall as the virtual image of his Golden Buddha.</p><p>Without thinking, Xiao Kongtong disbanded the present Gods and Buddhas from the Heart Sword Technique. Then, he gathered the power of the Fantasy Sword Technique and jumped onto the Demon God’s great spear.</p><p>“Fantasy Sword Technique, Space-time Transition!”</p><p>With a whoosh, the Demon God’s Great Spear rushed forward, but it couldn’t break through the stone Giants with its first move. Xiao Kongtong was so scared that he shivered and almost dropped the crystal gem containing the Semi-Saint Person.</p><p>He didn’t dare to try and attack again when the hundreds of stone Giants were slashing away with their heavy fists and knives.</p><p>“Space-time Transition! Jump! ! !”</p><p>The Spear pierced through the space.</p><p>During this period of time, Xiao Kongtong had almost explored half of the 300,000-mile-long Sleeping Valley.</p><p>With the Spear, he jumped onto the stone stele after he landed on Abyss Island, which was about 10,000 miles away.</p><p>“Huh”</p><p>“They can’t possibly catch up with me at this distance, can they?”</p><p>“As I expected, even under such circumstances, I was able to escape.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong felt relieved.</p><p>But just as he started to relax…</p><p>“Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang…”</p><p>The space behind him shattered and collapsed into endless darkness. Then, the huge feet of hundreds of the stone Giants stepped out of the space.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong: “? ? ?”</p><p>This time, his face turned green.</p><p>“They could still break through the space and follow him?”</p><p>“What exactly are you guys made of?!”</p><p>He didn’t dare to breathe anymore and quickly jumped onto the Demon God’s Great Spear.</p><p>“Space-time Transition… Jump! Jump! Jump!”</p><p>“Damn it, why are you so slow? Quick, jump further away! ! !”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
