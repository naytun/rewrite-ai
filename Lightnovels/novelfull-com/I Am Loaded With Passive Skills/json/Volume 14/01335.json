She held the Holy Miracle Fruit in her hands, not daring to look at him. She turned around and said, “I’ll go eat the fruit first…”</p><p>However, just as she finished speaking and her body had not completely turned away…</p><p>Lei Xi’er suddenly stepped forward and leaned close to Xu Xiaoshou’s face. Her breath smelled like orchids as she whispered in a seductive tone, “Xu Xiaoshou, am I beautiful?”</p><p>???</p><p>(Seduced. Passive points +1.)</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes widened. He felt the heat coming from his ear, and his pupils lost focus for a moment.</p><p>“Thud.”</p><p>His fingers loosen, and Holy Miracle Fruit fell to the ground.</p><p>“You, what, what do you mean?” Xu Xiaoshou placed his hand on Lei Xi’er’s forehead and asked.</p><p>With a swoosh.</p><p>The moment Lei Xi’er was touched by him, it was as if she had been electrocuted, and she instantly retreated a few steps.</p><p>As soon as the words left her mouth, she actually recovered and her face turned red on the spot. After a long time, even her ears were so hot that they were about to bleed.</p><p>“I’m, I’m sorry. Recently, I’ve been having some mental problems…”</p><p>Tap tap tap tap.</p><p>Without further explanation, Lei Xi-er did not dare to stay for even a second longer. As she left quickly, she wanted to scold Mu Zixi in her mind.</p><p>“Mu Zixi!”</p><p>However, after a pause, Lei Xi’er did not scold herself like Mu Zixi did. She only helplessly advised.</p><p>“I advise you not to cause any more trouble. I’m telling you, you’ve just woken up. If you want to control this body by force, you’ll only waste a lot of energy.”</p><p>“Hahahahaha!” In the dark space of consciousness, only the little loli’s joyful laughter could be heard.</p><p>Fun, really fun!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou really fell for this!</p><p>Lei Xi’er was silent. She quickened her pace and only wanted to leave.</p><p>She couldn’t stay in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer for a moment longer.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou…also had to leave quickly!</p><p>After the battle at Abyss Island, they should part ways immediately. If they stayed any longer, something would definitely happen!</p><p>Looking at the graceful back of the figure who was leaving in a hurry, Xu Xiaoshou’s soul couldn’t return to his body for a long time. After a long time, he seemed to remember something and asked,</p><p>“Lei Xi’er, are you really alright? Your forehead is very hot, are you feeling unwell?”</p><p>“I’m fine,” She said. Lei Xi’er didn’t even turn her head as she threw out these words.</p><p>“You definitely have a…”</p><p>Before Xu xiaoshou could finish his words, he saw the figure in front of him, who was about to leave, stop in his tracks. In a flash, she was in front of him again.</p><p>She then leaned forward and returned to her previous charming appearance, smiling sweetly, “Xu Xiaoshou, between the ancestral tree, Dragon Apricot, and I, who is prettier?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>The last time he was teased like this, he didn’t have time to react.</p><p>This time, he widened his eyes in disbelief and saw it very clearly.</p><p>The delicate and pretty face in front of him still had some residual blush on her cheeks.</p><p>Her long eyelashes were trembling slightly. Her God Devil Eyes were no longer mysterious. They were filled with the clearest and most direct expectations and nervousness.</p><p>“Thump thump thump thump thump”</p><p>His heart suddenly beat faster.</p><p>(Enticed. Passive points +1)</p><p>“Gulp~”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s adam apple rolled, and he subconsciously blurted out, “W-what do you mean?”</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>After Lei Xi’er finished asking, she suddenly screamed.</p><p>Her voice was so high-pitched that it almost pierced people’s eardrums, interrupting Xu Xiaoshou’s following words.</p><p>In the next second, it was as if all the blood in Lei Xi’er’s body was flowing backward, rushing to her face. Her shame and embarrassment turned into a blood-red color, almost overflowing.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou! Don’t answer my question!”</p><p>With a stomp of her feet, she created a crack in the ground of the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>However, the crack was too small. In a flash, Lei Xi’er disappeared from the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded.</p><p>“But, that’s a question you asked yourself…”</p><p>As the master of the Yuan Mansion, he easily saw Lei Xi’er flash to the broken tower of the original Zhang Mansion’s Hidden Scriptures Pavilion. Then, she shrank into a corner, hugging her knees and facing the wall, her expression unclear.</p><p>“What’s this?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was confused.</p><p>He did not understand, but he was greatly shocked.</p><p>Why? This didn’t seem like something Lei Xi’er would ask.</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>“Between XXX and I, who is prettier? Isn’t this the little trick I used in the Spirit Palace to pull Little Junior Sister’s wool? Why would Lei Xi’er ask such a shameful question?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly realized that this was the key point!</p><p>In the past, when he had free time to ask his Junior Sister this, he would definitely get a bunch of “cursed” words. Now, Lei Xi’er was also asking this question. Did it mean that…</p><p>Little Junior Sister has returned?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
