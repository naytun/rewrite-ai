After Mei Siren looked down, he was like a compassionate and calm Buddha emitting a power that made him feel fearful.</p><p>“What is going on?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi could not believe it. How could Mei Siren, a Sword Deity at the higher void level, could have such a will?</p><p>There were only two things a demi-saint feared, the power of the Holy Emperor and the ancestral source.</p><p>Could it be that what Mei Siren had displayed when he lowered his eyes was one of the two powers?</p><p>“Jiang Buyi, are you looking down on me because I have not become a demi-saint and without a Saint Statue?” After Mei Siren looked up again, there was a rage in his eyes.</p><p>In an instant, the blue hairpin that bound his hair broke. He floated into the air, his long hair fluttering. “if that’s the case, you can’t be more wrong!”</p><p>His hands formed sword fingers, and he formed a seal in front of his chest.</p><p>Mei Siren’s voice sank, and Path Principles exploded from him. Moreover, a strong holy will suddenly burst out from her body!</p><p>It was the holy will!</p><p>Without becoming a saint, having the holy will was useless. It could only prove one’s potential, and one might become a saint in the future.</p><p>However, it was different for Mei Siren.</p><p>His will was the embodiment of his power!</p><p>His holy will seemed to be much stronger than that of the demi-saint Jiang Buyi!</p><p>“The sword technique lives in me, and I live in the sword technique. My heart leads me to the path where there’s nothing else but the Way of the Sword,” Mei Sien said these words in Saint Language, and the whole universe could hear his voice.</p><p>In the end, the will in his body condensed, and an angry voice sounded out. It materialized from imagination and took the shape of an imperial decree.</p><p>“Because…”</p><p>“I am the truth, the way, and the life!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Forest of Miracles’ ultimate attribute seemed to have been smothered at this moment.</p><p>In the unprecedented explosion, a huge and terrifying virtual image of Goodhood was shaped on the back of Mei Siren. It rose and was several times larger than Jiang Buyi’s Saint Statue!</p><p>“Oh my…” Xu Xiaoshou fell in the air, staring at the virtual image that Master Siren had summoned.</p><p>Master Siren hadn’t become a demi-saint yet, so he didn’t have a Saint Statue, which meant it was just a virtual image.</p><p>However…</p><p>The image was breathtaking!</p><p>It had the most magnificent and colorful clothes, so beautiful that it was like a phantom that could only appear in an imagined world. It was surrounded by nine peerless heavy swords and was tainted with the thick aura of the mortal world, forming a world of its own. It stepped on Yama, and ten thousand swords bowed to it. Its hands grasped the void, but they were green in color. Even if one couldn’t see them, they would know that they were two invisible swords!</p><p>“Holy crap!” Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>He suddenly realized that this wasn’t just a virtual image but also contained a sword technique.</p><p>This was something visualized by the Heart Sword Technique of Mei Siren! This monster was known as the first realm of the Heart Sword Technique, Present Gods and Buddhas!</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou had seen Present Gods and Buddhas before.</p><p>Bazhun’an had used it while fighting against Gou Wuyue, but it wasn’t as overwhelming as the one Master Siren summoned.</p><p>How could this hideous monster come from the kind and calm Master Siren’s mind?</p><p>The more Xu Xiaoshou looked at it, the more he felt something was wrong. His eyes suddenly widened as if he finally understood the meaning of Master Siren’s Present Gods and Buddhas.</p><p>“The clothes are illusionary. The number of swords is nine. The mortal world is emotion. Yama is a ghost. Ten thousand swords bow to it. It controls the nothingness of the void, and the color is green, which means Mo…”</p><p>“Damn it, this image represents seven parts of Nine Major Sword Techniques, right?”</p><p>“This is only the first realm of Master Siren’s Heart Sword Technique. If Present Gods and Buddhas are the portrayals of Master Siren’s inner world, then he truly is the last sword technique, “Hidden,” in his daily life!”</p><p>“He’s the alloy of the Nine Major Sword Techniques, and Present Gods and Buddhas can be compared to Sword God…”</p><p>After Xu Xiaoshou understood what this monster represented, he was speechless and dumbfounded.</p><p>He thought of what Master Siren had just said.</p><p>“The only thing I know is the Way of the Sword, and the only thing I can do is to save people.”</p><p>All these words meant…</p><p>Bazhun’an had summoned Abyss Island after asking, “Do you think I am a Goodhood?” Master Siren had manifested Present Gods and Buddhas, the combination of the Nine Major Sword Techniques, after saying, “The only thing I know…”</p><p>Were all ancient swordsmen like this?</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points, +1”</p><p>Holy Light of Saints had been destroyed, and Mei Siren’s Present Gods and Buddhas had defeated the Hands of Saint Judge. At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou seemed to see the fear in the eyes of the demi-saint Jiang Buyi.</p><p>With Perception, he could clearly see more than half of the Forest of Miracles trembling at this moment.</p><p>Forest of Miracles’ ultimate attribute had already been activated, but Present Gods and Buddhas made the ancient trees crumble and the earth separate. All creatures surrendered to sword energy.</p><p>The restless scene returned to silence, and the entire Forest of Miracles looked like a strict school.</p><p>When the vicious teacher walked into the school and slammed the desk, even the most mischievous living beings had to quiet down obediently. They stood up, bowed, obeyed, and greeted the character with respect and fear.</p><p>“Master Siren, welcome.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
