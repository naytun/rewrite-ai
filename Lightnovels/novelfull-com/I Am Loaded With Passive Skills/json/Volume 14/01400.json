So how could the stone giants still sit unmovingly?</p><p>The semi-saint person and the demon-god Great Spear were the things they protected.</p><p>After chasing for so long, they had finally arrived at the arena of the half-saints. They were indeed afraid.</p><p>This was because these beings had the power to obliterate them.</p><p>However, no matter how afraid they were, it was their mission. The stone giants stepped in and broke the space with their feet. They also scattered and surrounded the people inside a hundred miles away.</p><p>The hundreds of stone giants could reach up to 10000 feet. They were simply existences that covered the sky.</p><p>It was as if a vast open-air castle had been built outside the arena!</p><p>In the arena, the void attendant, curled up weakly on the air wall, no longer had to try to reduce its presence.</p><p>This was because its height would be entirely out of place in the pile of stone giants behind.</p><p>If the demi-saint were to make a move, the world would be in crumbles. But, with the taller giants withstanding the force of destruction, it would not be the first to die.</p><p>“Huo Huo!”</p><p>The void attendant was excited. It moved its feet slightly and tried to lean back, trying to blend in with its brothers from the Sleeping Valley that it had known but had not seen for a long time.</p><p>With many giants stepping through space and following them into the arena, the gazes of the people in the arena changed.</p><p>It had to be said that the “Bazhun’an” alone might not be enough to stop such a significant battle.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
