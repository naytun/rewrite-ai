(1)</p><p>It was very annoying!</p><p>“With the shrinking of the holy realm, my location is indeed obvious.”</p><p>As he recalled Jiang Buyi’s words, Xu Xiaoshou understood everything in a flash.</p><p>He knew that he had no other choice, so he could only throw out a portrait clone that was in fear and respect and dispel the Vanishing Technique.</p><p>“I’m Xu Xiaoshou. Nice to meet you, Demi-Saint Jiang.”</p><p>Within the holy realm, the portrait clone cupped his fists and bowed, showing great courtesy.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was already trying his best to control the portrait clone, but as soon as he finished speaking, the remaining power of the demi-saint in the holy realm still made his portrait clone tremble, almost turning into a pile of spiritual energy and disintegrating.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was too gentle!</p><p>He even deliberately covered his face with a cloud of mist, afraid that Xu Xiaoshou, the junior, would die on the spot when he met the demi-saint.</p><p>However, when he turned his head and saw the loose spiritual energy in front of him, he was stunned.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you should be able to see my sincerity, but I can’t see the slightest bit of yours,” he muttered. His eyes under the cloud mist narrowed slightly, and his voice became a little heavier. “You don’t even dare to show your true body when facing me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wiped off his sweat frantically, cursing in his heart.</p><p>It was the first time that he couldn’t even control his portrait clone. Before the fight started, before he could take advantage of the situation, he had already been seen through by the naked eye.</p><p>So this was what the true demi-saint’s pressure felt like?</p><p>Sure enough, using the power of the Saint Statue to understand a demi-saint was like using the light of a firefly to estimate the bright moon. Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had been tricked by his subjective opinion.</p><p>His understanding of demi-saints all came from either Bazhun’an, Ai Cangsheng’s arrow of his Evil Sin Bow, or the Saint Statue Nine Dragons Burning the Ancestor that Elder Sang had given him.</p><p>To put it bluntly, he was too ignorant!</p><p>And ignorance made one arrogant!</p><p>If he could turn back time, Xu Xiaoshou swore that he would never mess with a demi-saint again at this stage.</p><p>“Please forgive me for my fear and uneasiness… Demi-Saint Jiang, you are too powerful. If my true body appeared, I’m afraid I wouldn’t be able to hold on and would die under your gaze.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou controlled the portrait clone and blew up the legs of the portrait clone, turning them into spiritual Qi while flattering Demi-Saint Jiang without leaving a trace.</p><p>He thought, “Did you see that, Demi-Saint Jiang?”</p><p>“This is the strength of me, Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“This is the difference between you and me!”</p><p>“I’m really weak. Please don’t do anything to me. Let’s talk it out. I’m rich and can make up for the mistakes I made just now.”</p><p>In the disappearing state, Xu Xiaoshou nervously held the unhurriedly beeping Communication Talisman. This was his last straw of hope.</p><p>He said inwardly, “Bazhun’an, you’re too slow! I’m gonna be killed!”</p><p>“You’re very interesting…” Jiang Buyi looked at the spiritual energy clone whose legs had exploded and only had half of its body left. The corners of his lips under the cloud mist curled up slightly. He was no longer bothered about whether Xu Xiaoshou had taken out his true body or a fake body.</p><p>To him, these were insignificant.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I’ve long heard that your intelligence is extraordinary. Guess why I’ve kept you alive until now instead of killing you directly,” Jiang Buyi said slowly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought, “Want me to guess? Are all big shots like this?”</p><p>The portrait clone of Xu Xiaoshou did not even dare to raise his head. He bowed even more when he heard that and cupped his fists. “I don’t dare. A demi-saint’s thought is as vast as the stars. How can a mortal see it?”</p><p>“I will only give you one chance.” Jiang Buyi did not like flattery, and his tone became more serious.</p><p>“How would I know what you’re up to?” Xu Xiaoshou thought. He was about to collapse, but he didn’t dare to mess around again. He suddenly changed the topic and said, “I guess maybe I’m still of some use.”</p><p>He pondered for a moment, trying to figure out the thoughts of the other party.</p><p>Then he carefully said, “Although I’m the descendant of the Holy Palace’s traitor, I do have a connection to Holy Palace’s Demi-Saint Infernal after all.”</p><p>He continued, “Even if the Saint Servant doesn’t think much of me, Eighth Sword Deity has shown up for me a few times. In the eyes of outsiders, I’m one of the few people in the younger generation who can catch Eighth Sword Deity’s eyes.”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou spoke, he sneaked a glance at the other party and almost blew up the portrait clone on the spot.</p><p>That was because Jiang Buyi suddenly dispersed the cloud mist that covered his face and looked over with his deep eyes. “Are you threatening me?”</p><p>“No, I didn’t!” Xu Xiaoshou immediately cried out and retreated.</p><p>He thought, “This is just a reminder! Reminder, you know? How can it be a threat? Would I dare?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried his best to stabilize himself, but his mind suddenly became active.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was very clear about his background…</p><p>He also knew that he had been used by Xu Xiaoshou in this place, but he still sent Rao Yaoyao away before communicating with Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Teng Shanhai could make him get furious with just a few words. However, he could still calmly stay and have gentle communication with Xu Xiaoshou after Xu Xiaoshou had used him.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have realized something.</p><p>He had actually encountered similar situations many times.</p><p>He had experienced it when he was facing Night Guardian, Bazhun’an, and Yama.</p><p>Jiang Buyi seemed to be trying to take him in.</p><p>“A truly sober chess player doesn’t care how many pawns he has lost because that’s all in the past.”</p><p>“What they care about is the pawn that caused them to suffer heavy losses. If he’s really a great talent, can he be of use to them?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou originally didn’t have such confidence.</p><p>However, every sober and rational superior he had seen wanted to invite him to join them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
