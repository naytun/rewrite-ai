He frowned and pondered, but he did not go over to disturb her.</p><p>If Little Junior Sister had really returned, then Lei Xi’er’s body should be able to produce Little Junior sister’s voice?</p><p>…Just like how he would occasionally hear his Little Junior sister’s voice.</p><p>However, the current situation was that even if Lei Xi’er was acting strangely, she would still use her tone to say what Little Junior Sister would say.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that perhaps it wasn’t that his Little Junior Sister had returned, but that Lei Xi’er had been affected by another consciousness, and had become even more deeply affected.</p><p>Or perhaps it was because…</p><p>Little Junior Sister had woken up, but not completely?</p><p>“Gulp, gulp~”</p><p>His stomach once again sent out a signal of hunger and thirst.</p><p>The fragrance of the spirit herbs in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer was constantly stimulating one’s sense of smell.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and stopped thinking.</p><p>“What’s the point of thinking so much? Those who should return will return!”</p><p>“But now, if I don’t eat a few Holy Miracle Fruits, I’ll be letting down my brother Hong Dang’s hard work!”</p><p>Back to reality.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the Holy Miracle Fruit in his hand and couldn’t help but salivate.</p><p>When fighting Double Dumba*s, his opponent was on his last breath, so even with the Holy Power, he could not withstand the attack of Xu Xiaoshou, who was no stranger to the power of Holy Power.</p><p>However, this did not mean that the Holy Power was not strong!</p><p>As long as he ate the Holy Miracle Fruit, even if it was in the memory of Double Dumba*s, where 99% of its power would be wasted, it would still produce a thin holy power.</p><p>It was equivalent to the moment when the Holy Blood was consumed and the demi-saint’s power was attached to the body.</p><p>Furthermore, as time passed, this wisp of Holy Power would grow on its own until an ordinary person consumed the Holy Blood, resisted the power of the Holy Blood, and completely mastered the Holy Power.</p><p>Most importantly, the increase brought about by the Holy Blood would disappear, and it would be accompanied by great side effects.</p><p>The Holy Miracle Fruit would not!</p><p>“Double Dumba*s wasted so much of the medicine and still managed to struggle on whilst at death’s door. He had a few chances to escape from death. If his opponent wasn’t me, he might have really escaped.”</p><p>“Now that I’m no longer being chased by the void attendant, I can absorb the power of the Holy Miracle Fruit 100% using the breathing technique. How much power will I gain?”</p><p>The head-sized Holy Miracle Fruit looked at Xu Xiaoshou and suddenly, it seemed as if it had a demonic smile and was saying, “Come on, eat me, do you dare to eat me? Once you did, you’ll die from contentment!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression was fierce. After doing enough mental work for himself, he finally gritted his teeth and decided to try it as soon as possible. He didn’t want to give the Holy Miracle Fruit any more chances to show off.</p><p>He held the fruit between his nose and mouth.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>“Let the storm come more violently!”</p><p>“Hiss~~~”</p><p>He swallowed it in one gulp.</p><p>The Holy Miracle Fruit turned into two tornadoes of spiritual energy and entered Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth and nose.</p><p>“Yes,”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly stood up straight, closed his knees, put his hands on his thighs, and twisted twice as if he was trying to hide his pain.</p><p>“Uh-huh~”</p><p>He tried his best to suppress his bright expression, shackling his face. His whole body was stiff, and he tried hard to suppress all the desires that were trying to bloom.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>Suddenly, all the pores on his body opened.</p><p>A rich medicinal fragrance gushed out from every part of Xu Xiaoshou’s body. He turned into a leaking leather ball and shot into the sky.</p><p>The breathing technique was still in operation.</p><p>As he couldn’t bear to miss any of the medicinal power, Xu xiaoshou absorbed the dissipated medicinal power back into his body.</p><p>This time, he couldn’t take it anymore.</p><p>The double assault made every part of his skin sensitive.</p><p>The moment he was launched into the air, his skin came into contact with his clothes, and he felt goosebumps all over his body. Then, pleasure filled his mind, and comfort filled his consciousness.</p><p>He could no longer control his image.</p><p>“Mm~~~~”</p><p>“Oh~~~~”</p><p>“Heavens! Don’t, don’t do this, I’ll break…”</p><p>Outside the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, Greedy the Cat Spirit was envious as it watched the recipient eat the holy medicine.</p><p>Seeing this, the little white cat was so frightened that it stood up on its hind legs, its tail high in the air, and its two small front paws kept scratching the air.</p><p>Poison?</p><p>It turned out to be poison!</p><p>No wonder master didn’t allow it to eat the fruit. So this was what happened after one ate this poison?</p><p>“Pa pa pa pa!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fell from the sky and hit the ground, then bounced up and flew into the sky.</p><p>The cycle repeated endlessly.</p><p>He was like a human-shaped pile driver. Every time he fell, he would smash a deep pit.</p><p>The skin that touched the ground instantly felt a large amount of “comfort “, like a cat who had swallowed catnip, drank a basin of cold water, and finally inhaled a few mouthfuls of cold air in the North Pole.</p><p>He was in a state where he was feeling the happy coldness in the heat of the holy medicine’s power.</p><p>This intoxicating combination of Ice and Fire attacked the soul again and again as if it would not stop until it smashed the person.</p><p>“Too much, too full…”</p><p>The power of the holy medicine was too strong. It’s not something that the spiritual cultivation pill and the origin court pill can compare to.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s remaining consciousness was filled with regret. He felt that he shouldn’t have been so impulsive to directly absorb the Holy Miracle Fruit.</p><p>However, his body was honest.</p><p>Clearly, he only needed to release some of the holy medicine’s power from his pores to alleviate this feeling.</p><p>However, Xu xiaoshou refused.</p><p>No matter how much or how full he was, he could rely on his willpower to resist and eat it all!</p><p>Overflow?</p><p>That was impossible!</p><p>Every meal on the plate was so hard to obtain!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
