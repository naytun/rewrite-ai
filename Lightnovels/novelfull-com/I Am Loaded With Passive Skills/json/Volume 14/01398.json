That sword attack just now exhausted 100 percent of my power. If we continue fighting, we will both be injured.”</p><p>The thunder calamity cloud exploded. The rumbling sound exploded. Jiang Buyi’s voice fell from the sky. He could not control his emotions, as if he had gone crazy.</p><p>“But you killed one of my demi-saint incarnations! ” Jiang Buyi was furious and wanted to cry but had no tears.</p><p>He had thought that the worst outcome would be that his soul would be injured after this battle, and he would need several years to recuperate.</p><p>However, he had never expected Mei Siren to use the last move, “Space-Time Transition,” to ignore the soul armor and transfer all the damage to their bodies.</p><p>He was a dignified demi-saint, but he was killed!</p><p>It was gone with one sword!</p><p>The fourth realm of the Nine Major Sword Techniques instantly destroyed the defenseless soul body. It did not even cause a splash.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was terrified.</p><p>If he had not transferred the damage to his demi-saint form before he died, one of the demi-saints in the world would have been eliminated!</p><p>What a terrifying fact!</p><p>Mei Siren! Sword Deity! It could kill a saint!</p><p>The incarnation of a demi-saint was so difficult to cultivate. Jiang Buyi was filled with regret and hatred. The sword of Mei Siren had forcibly removed 30 percent of his strength permanently!</p><p>“You were the one who insisted on testing the sword. I’ve already informed you in advance.”</p><p>Mei Siren looked at the calamity clouds of thunder and fire in the sky, trying not to anger the other party with his tone. Instead, he said calmly, “Think about why you’re here, demi-saint Jiang. What will you get if we continue to fight even if I die here?”</p><p>That’s right, what can I get?</p><p>For a moment, Jiang Buyi was confused. He thought Mei Siren could not hurt him, so he did not take it to heart.</p><p>But now, he had treated his opponent as a demi-saint and treated him equally.</p><p>He realized that even if both sides were to fight wholeheartedly, one of them would die here, and he would be the one to survive.</p><p>What could he get?</p><p>Kill Xu Xiaoshou to vent his anger?</p><p>Had he spent decades condensing the demi-saint’s incarnation in exchange for the life of a junior and to get nothing substantial in the end?</p><p>No matter how he calculated this, it was not worth it!</p><p>But the problem was…</p><p>He had already sacrificed a demi-saint’s incarnation for this battle, which was decades of cultivation.</p><p>His demi-saint incarnation was gone, and he had also lost his reputation. How would he cope with this shame for the rest of his life?</p><p>Would this not be the joke of the ages when people say, “Demi-saint Jiang Buyi was scared off by one sword strike from the Seven Sword Deity, Mei Siren”?</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>A furious roar suddenly came from Nine Heavens.</p><p>The calamity clouds churned and covered half of the Forest of Miracles.</p><p>“Boom, boom, boom!”</p><p>Bolts of red lightning struck down, turning the surrounding tens of thousands of miles into a mess.</p><p>Mei Siren understood.</p><p>Jiang Buyi did not want to fight anymore. However, he could not retreat. If he did, the demi-saint would be ashamed.</p><p>However, he could only be impolite since Jiang Buyi would not back down even if he gave him a way out.</p><p>The red lightning from the Nine Heavens struck, but Mei Siren was all alone. He looked up and said calmly, “Jiang Buyi, although I am tired, what I said just now was not a lie. I did not say that there were three swords.”</p><p>“If you still want to fight, I have two more swords. I don’t know how many demi-saint incarnations you have left to be your scapegoat?”</p><p>As soon as he said that, the calamity cloud in the Nine Heavens suddenly expanded, and the area it covered expanded from tens of thousands of miles to hundreds of thousands of miles.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi was about to go crazy.</p><p>Endless thunderbolts descended from his immortal body and bombarded the ground, destroying the entire Forest of Miracles.</p><p>However, unexpectedly, none of the thunderbolts affected Mei Siren.</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>In the disappearing state, Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>Was this the demi-saint stage’s “incompetent fury”? It had affected the entire Forest of Miracles all at once. It was even more terrifying than all the people who had transcended the tribulation in the deep sea combined.</p><p>Such a terrifying demi-saint.</p><p>Mei Siren stood quietly on the spot, with the thunderclouds in the Nine Heavens as his backdrop and the eternal flames as the scenery. He crossed his arms in front of his chest and stood alone, watching the end of the world coldly.</p><p>However, Jiang Buyi did not dare to touch him!</p><p>“What’s magnificent?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were wide open. It turned out that someone below the demi-saint level could kill a demi-saint with one sword strike and make a demi-saint enter into a rage with one word.</p><p>No!</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s body had turned into a thundercloud himself!</p><p>“Bang, bang! Bang, bang! Bang, bang, bang, bang…”</p><p>At this moment, the Holy Emperor’s Dragon Scale, which had calmed down after Master Siren’s entrance, suddenly began to throb at an extreme rate.</p><p>The sound wave even caused a recoil power in Xu Xiaoshou’s chest, directly piercing his head, causing his head to swell, and he almost collapsed.</p><p>“What on earth?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was keenly aware of the impending danger.</p><p>Without thinking, he locked the source of the danger on the clouds of thunder and fire in the Nine Heavens.</p><p>“Jiang Buyi, you wish to kill me?”</p><p>One could not blame the cowardly Xu Xiaoshou for thinking this way. He only put himself in his shoes and stammered, “If I were Jiang Buyi…”</p><p>“The water ghost trapped me when I entered Abyss Island. I killed Teng Shanhai because Xu Xiaoshou tricked me. Mei Siren destroyed one of my demi-saint incarnations because of saint servant Xu Xiaoshou. Now that the situation has come to this, I won’t even have the confidence to defeat the Seven Sword Deity. I must escape.”</p><p>But his demi-saint reputation would be gone if he had left so dejectedly. He would lose his life.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
