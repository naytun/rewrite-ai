Then he said, “Then let me tell you another fact. Teng Shanhai is dead. He was killed by the person before us. Before he died, he displayed the power of Demon God!”</p><p>Teng Shanhai?</p><p>Combat Division Chief, Teng Shanhai?</p><p>Did he die?</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was taken aback. He looked into the distance and then back at the person in front of him. His expression became suspicious. “Didn’t you say that you don’t dare to look?”</p><p>Was that the main point? Ye Xiaotian was speechless. “I don’t dare to look at the demi-saint, but I dare to peek at others.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was speechless.</p><p>“Now, tell me, how much time is left?” Ye Xiaotian chuckled.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong took another deep breath. “I said ten breaths. I’ll change my surname to yours if one breath is less!”</p><p>“You’re quite confident. You better be able to do it.” Ye Xiaotian raised his brows.</p><p>“You save them, and I’ll cover the rear. I can take it for ten breaths, but I’ll die after that.” Xiao Kongtong revealed everything. “I hope your Spatial Upanishad won’t let me down.”</p><p>“Don’t worry. You can hold on for ten breaths. I won’t be unable to save him.” Ye Xiaotian nodded.</p><p>“Then let’s go. Xu Xiaoshou is still waiting for us.” Xiao Kongtong had a firm face as he turned to leave.</p><p>“Wait for a moment.” Ye Xiaotian was not in a hurry. He picked up something from his spatial ring and took out a few pill bottles.</p><p>“What is this?” Xiao Kongtong was curious.</p><p>“Holy Blood.”</p><p>“Holy Blood?” Xiao Kongtong’s eyes widened. “Are all these bottles filled with it?”</p><p>“You’re so tall that you can resist it. If I don’t use the Holy Blood, I can’t leave the demi-saint’s holy realm,” Ye Xiaotian raised his eyes and replied nonchalantly.</p><p>“I mean…” Xiao Kongtong swallowed. “You’re a little too extravagant!”</p><p>“Is it strange?” In the end, Ye Xiaotian chose Demi-Saint Infernal’s Holy Blood, which had no side effects. It was very useful, and he had used it once before.</p><p>After keeping the rest of the Holy Blood, Ye Xiaotian rubbed his chin when he noticed that the person in front of him was staring at him intently. “They’re all rewards from the Holy Palace. I haven’t used them in a long time. They’re all dust-covered. You know, talents should at least get some rewards.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong swallowed again as he rubbed his hands together and said, “Then, can I have a bottle too?”</p><p>“In your dreams!”</p><p>“One drop? One drop is enough! We’re going to do something big now, so we can’t let anything happen!”</p><p>“You’re so tall, so you don’t need the Holy Blood.” Ye Xiaotian ignored the rude request of the person in front of him. He took out the Holy Blood and put it in his mouth instead of swallowing it. Then, he flew away and sneaked toward his target.</p><p>“Stingy!” Xiao Kongtong looked at the back of the white-haired man with a smile. He did not dare to use his ability, so he carefully hid his aura and followed.</p><p>There was so much Holy Blood.</p><p>On the way, the more Xiao Kongtong thought about it, the angrier he became. He could only take out the only drop of Holy Blood his teacher had given him, but he didn’t swallow it. He only sniffed it and put it back in its original place like a treasure.</p><p>It was infuriating to compare with others.</p><p>“Not only stingy, but you’re also short. You stingy shorty!”</p><p>…</p><p>In the holy realm, the ancient forest that had been revived from the dead wound its way up, and the deathly aura was getting stronger and stronger as time passed.</p><p>However, the area within a hundred miles of Jiang Buyi was not affected at all.</p><p>After the ultimate attribute was activated, the vast Forest of Miracles looked like a filthy quagmire that was about to devour people. The holy realm was a pure land in this endless quagmire.</p><p>And Jiang Buyi was the pure lotus that grew out of the mud and was not stained.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I don’t have that much time for you. Since you dare to call me by my name, you should know the consequences.”</p><p>“The holy realm is not uncontrollable. I know that you are still here. You don’t dare to escape, but I can narrow the scope of the holy realm.”</p><p>“In that case, your location is obvious.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi stood with his hands behind his back and looked around.</p><p>He had been waiting for a long time, but his face was still calm. There was no impatience or anger after being used.</p><p>“Tick tock… Tick tock…”</p><p>In the disappearing state, the sweat on Xu Xiaoshou’s forehead and back fell down like raindrops.</p><p>Holy Emperor Dragon Scale’s heartbeat and Xu Xiaoshou’s own heartbeat reached an extreme speed at that moment. They resonated with each other like the beating of a drum.</p><p>“He really knows everything…”</p><p>The intelligence of Jiang Buyi, the demi-saint, was not on the same level as that of Teng Shanhai. He was not so easy to fool.</p><p>He had just torn apart a higher void level cultivator and killed a Sword Deity. In the next second, this guy was planning to deal with the mastermind behind this battle.</p><p>And the mastermind was Xu Xiaoshou… Xu Xiaoshou knew that he had indeed done everything, even though he had not done anything.</p><p>Jiang Buyi wanted to settle the score with him, and he could not even explain it.</p><p>This was because Jiang Buyi and Teng Shanhai both came because of him. Moreover, the enmity between the two of them was formed because Teng Shanhai was tricked by him.</p><p>Killing someone by using another person was indeed a wonderful plan that Xu Xiaoshou had thought of.</p><p>However, he really didn’t expect that it would happen here and that one of them would die. Moreover, the consequences of the death of one of them had become so serious!</p><p>The void attendant, who was supposed to be able to defeat a demi-saint, was killed with one punch.</p><p>The person who was supposed to die or be seriously injured by the void attendant in Abyss Island was not Jiang Buyi. Instead, it was Teng Shanhai who had come as an uninvited guest.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little confused for a moment.</p><p>The result of the plan was there, but the targets in the process were all wrong. Everyone didn’t take the right place, and they didn’t play by the rules.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
