Its eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>It bent and roared joyfully.</p><p>It had been a day!</p><p>It had been a full day!</p><p>It had searched the entire Forest of Miracles but had not found the Herb thief. It did not think that it could gain something so unexpected in this Ancient City.</p><p>Just now, the aura of the Spiritual Herbs which belonged to the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer had appeared.</p><p>It wasn’t in the Saint Punishment Square, nor was it in the area of the Ancient City’s construction zone. On the contrary, it was in the Forest of Miracles!</p><p>“Was this what humans meant by ‘darkness under the light’?”</p><p>The Void Attendant felt that it had gone through the Forest of Miracles with a fine tooth comb, but even though it had exhausted its life’s efforts, it still could not find the Herb thief.</p><p>It turned out that the thief had not run out of the Forest of Miracles. He had hidden somewhere near the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>“Roar… Roar… Roar!”</p><p>The Void Attendant didn’t have time to think about the details.</p><p>It only knew that it had to return immediately, grab the Herb thief, and use ten thousand methods to torture him to death.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>It broke the space with a kick.</p><p>The Void Attendant rushed into the Spatial Fragment with a swish.</p><p>It appeared at the edge of the Ancient City’s construction zone in one stride. After a few more steps, it would soon be close to the zone.</p><p>However, the Forest of Miracles was too big, after all, and the Void Attendant’s space attainments were not deep. Like the Stone Giants, it could not cross the entire Abyss Island with a single step.</p><p>“Quick.”</p><p>“I need to hurry.”</p><p>The Void Attendant’s heart burned with anxiety. It was afraid that if it were any slower, the Herb thief would disappear again.</p><p>“Human, thief, you must die!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Ah… ah… ah… ah!”</p><p>Outside the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, the hysterical roars continued.</p><p>Teng Shanhai had to admit that Xu Xiaoshou had succeeded. He managed to ignite his anger to the extreme.</p><p>However, so what?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, your strategy is indeed effective. I know you’re just stalling for time.”</p><p>“However, the boost from the Holy Blood is too minimal for you!”</p><p>“As for the ‘Power of Demon God’ in my body, it’s far from what you’ve seen before, so now you will know!”</p><p>In the deep underground abyss, Teng Shanhai’s single eye was blood red. The ferocious aura of the Xiao Divine Spear swirled about like clouds and mist and filled the entire area.</p><p>All of a sudden, the desolate Xiao Divine Spear in Teng Shanhai’s hand trembled. The aura of the Holy Power on his body erupted and turned into a beam of light that shot into the sky.</p><p>“Hahaha, you didn’t expect this right, Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“You’re stalling for time, so am I!”</p><p>Teng Shanhai laughed hysterically as the patterns on his Cang God Armor lit up.</p><p>Then, with a bang, the armor on his right arm shattered, and his thick arm was no longer restrained. With another bang, his muscles expanded and turned into a gigantic arm that was even larger than his entire body.</p><p>The Xiao Divine Spear was already big enough. Its spearhead was the size of three human heads.</p><p>Originally, when Teng Shanhai wielded the Xiao Divine Spear, he had to hold it with both hands in a half-hug position. Now that his right arm was no longer restrained by the Cang God Armor and turned into a gigantic hand, he could actually hold the Xiao Divine Spear with one palm.</p><p>“The power of Demon God, unseal!”</p><p>At this moment, Teng Shanhai’s Xiao Divine Spear had grown more than ten feet in length and it completely covered his tiny body.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I’m waiting for the power of the Holy Blood to stimulate the power of Demon God, and then the ‘Half-step awakening’.”</p><p>“How about you? What are you waiting for? Are you waiting for death?”</p><p>A deep groan resounded. In the next second, Teng Shanhai’s figure in the deep pit disappeared from his ‘Perception’.</p><p>“Bang bang, bang bang, bang, bang…!”</p><p>At the same time, the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale’s heartbeat suddenly increased.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his scalp go numb, and without a second thought, he disappeared on the spot.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Before his form could disappear with the ‘Vanishing Technique’, in the next second, a round Xiao Divine Spear, which did not have any enhancement from any Spiritual Technique and which relied purely on physical strength, viciously whipped about in midair.</p><p>“Bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang!”</p><p>The space exploded. With the spearhead of Xiao Divine Spear as the source and the space in the distance as the line, the explosion resounded thousands of miles away.</p><p>Just like that, a black spatial thread was destroyed by its pure power. It connected to the distant mountain top, and with a loud explosion, half of the mountain was shattered.</p><p>“Damn!”</p><p>In his Disappearing State, Xu Xiaoshou’s heart pounded violently and his eyes stared straight ahead.</p><p>What kind of power was this?</p><p>So the Cang God Armor was only the sealing artifact of the Chief of the Combat division, Teng Shanhai?</p><p>This fellow had only unsealed one of his arms, yet his strength had mutated to such an exaggerated extent?</p><p>“Physical strength?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t believe it. “If this was the power of the physical body, it probably could exceed the level of a Sovereign Physique, right?”</p><p>He had never seen a Demi- Saint’s Physique, but it was probably just like this?</p><p>“No, it’s not physical strength. this is what he called the ‘Power of Demon God’. This guy’s true Combat strength is not limited to this.”</p><p>“I’m afraid he didn’t even use one-ten-thousandth of his full potential during the night battle in the Imperial City. Was it because there were too many innocent Spiritual Cultivators there, so it was not good to unleash his full power?”</p><p>The Holy Emperor Dragon Scale’s heartbeat still hammered away at a rapid pace.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that something was wrong.</p><p>He had not been able to keep up with Teng Shanhai’s speed just now. He had only sensed that something was wrong and had reacted in advance. He had used the Vanishing Technique to protect himself.</p><p>Logically speaking, as long as he disappeared forever, no matter how strong Teng Shanhai became, he should not be able to find him without a Divine Object like the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale.</p><p>As a result, he was not the threat and the reason for the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale’s heartbeat to beat so rapidly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
