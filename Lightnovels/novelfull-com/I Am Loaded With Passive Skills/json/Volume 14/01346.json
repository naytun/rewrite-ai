Xu Xiaoshou felt the spiritual cleansing of his soul slowly dissipating and he was about to lose control over the power in his hands.</p><p>“Calm down, calm down!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou jumped in fright, and didn’t dare to play around any longer. He hurriedly took advantage of Lei Xi ‘er’s help with his control and instantly arrived at the edge of the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>After that, he carefully peeled off the five energy seeds and threw them into the Chaotic Mist, one by one.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>The first explosion came from the energy seed of the Little Blue Flower of the Tranquil Lake.</p><p>The black shattered space that covered a thousand miles even swallowed up a lot of the Chaotic Mist. Xu Xiaoshou’s eyelids twitched wildly, and Lei Xi-er’s heart trembled in fear.</p><p>This was obviously not just the power of the Little Blue Flower of the Tranquil Lake. It had already been affected by the other four Saint Stage powers.</p><p>“Cut the crap and continue.” Lei Xi ‘er interrupted, her tone already sounding a bit weak.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at her and did not speak anymore. He continued to throw out the original seed of Sword Cognition.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>Another energy seed exploded and shattered the space within a thousand miles.</p><p>Boundless darkness blanketed half of the sky of the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>Ice and Ember, who were immersed in icebergs and volcanoes, looked dazedly at the two people in the distance who were working on the explosion project in the Yuan Mansion and were soon lost in their own thoughts.</p><p>“Shua shua shua shua…”</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>“If this attack had landed on me, I’m afraid I would have been blown to pieces. As expected of my owner.”</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Ice was also amazed.</p><p>“When did our owner become so powerful?”</p><p>Even it could not withstand this move.</p><p>“There are still three more seeds”</p><p>Before the Chaotic Mist, Xu Xiaoshou looked at the remaining three true Saint Stage power seeds in his hand and fell silent for a long time.</p><p>The explosion was beyond his imagination.</p><p>In the past, he didn’t know the rules of the Shengshen Continent. He didn’t know why a battle between those above the Sovereign Stage had to be fought in the sky.</p><p>Now he knew.</p><p>If the Sovereign Stage was already like this, then there was no need to talk about the power of the Saint Stage level.</p><p>Two mere pseudo Saint Stage energy balls were able to destroy an area of a thousand miles. If all five of them were to be thrown at the same time, half of the Yunlun Mountain Range would probably be destroyed.</p><p>Was this the reason why the Demi-Saints of the continent were all isolated and could not be seen?</p><p>At a certain moment, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt that perhaps the path of the Holy Divine Palace was not that wrong.</p><p>If the Demi-Saints were not locked up in the Inner Island of the Abyss Island and allowed to attack, the world would have already been in chaos!</p><p>Lei Xi ‘er looked at the black hole that stretched as far as the eye could see, and her expression turned ugly.</p><p>“Let’s go to another place and continue to throw.”</p><p>She didn’t dare to let Xu Xiaoshou throw any more seeds into the black hole, for fear that it would trigger a chain reaction that would cause the collapse of the Yuan Mansion. Thus, she had no choice but to move to another place and continue.</p><p>On this day.</p><p>The Yuan Mansion was once again dominated by ‘terror.’</p><p>“BOOM!” BOOM! BOOM!”</p><p>When the remaining three true Saint Stage seeds were used…</p><p>The surrounding space, other than the ground, was all black.</p><p>Even the sky had darkened!</p><p>The entire Yuan Mansion was originally full of life, but now, it showed signs of decline.</p><p>It was as if the world Spirit had exploded.</p><p>“I am not even fully awake yet?”</p><p>“Which idiot placed bombs in my body?”</p><p>“What about the world Lord?”</p><p>“He didn’t even care about this!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Look at what you’ve done!”</p><p>When the explosions ended, Lei Xi-er’s anger rose.</p><p>Sometimes, she was really afraid that when she woke up, she would be dragged by Xu Xiaoshou to become a ‘criminal on the run’ even before she could even get her revenge.</p><p>More importantly, this wasn’t because of the invasion of the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>It was only because of Xu Xiaoshou’s ‘courting death’ attitude!</p><p>“I was wrong.” Xu Xiaoshou admitted his mistake sincerely with a contrite face. “I didn’t expect that I would be so strong.”</p><p>Cursed. Passive Points: +1, +1,+1,+1…</p><p>Lei Xi ‘er took a deep breath and felt her Godhood spirit was decidedly weary.</p><p>She really wanted to give him a good lecture, like “You’re a grown up, you’re no longer a child. The techniques that you could experiment with in the past, are no longer suitable for you to try in the Yuan Mansion, etc, etc.”</p><p>But after she mulled over it, she didn’t say anything in the end.</p><p>After all, Xu Xiaoshou was still her Eldest Senior Brother. What if he felt humiliated and fired another shot?</p><p>“You should reflect on what you’ve done!”</p><p>She was tired.</p><p>Lei Xi ‘er braced her exhausted body and walked back to the Collapsed Tower.</p><p>She had just eaten the Holy Miracle Fruit, so why did she still feel so weak?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, this lunatic!</p><p>This was simply unreasonable!</p><p>As he watched Lei Xi-er leave, Xu Xaoshou’s sincere apologetic expression immediately vanished, and a flash of ecstasy appeared on his face.</p><p>“I’m too strong!”</p><p>“The God Devil Eyes’s Godhood power has such a strong auxiliary effect that it can even help me control the Saint Stage power.”</p><p>“If I get Lei Xi ‘er to manifest her demonic power, she can help me strengthen my complete form. When I use the ‘Saint ‘Seeds on All Five Fingers’, ‘Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand’ and ‘Berserk Giant’, all my energy will be completely out of control.”</p><p>“A bit more Godhood, a bit more of demonic nature, then Godhood again, demonic nature again, the cycle is repeated. If this energy does not become chaotic, my surname is not Xu!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clenched his fists and sensed the depletion of his Energy Reserve. He felt a great Path had opened up in front of him.</p><p>“Would that kind of explosion kill a Demi-Saint?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
