(2)</p><p>Therefore, Xu Xiaoshou had to think in this direction because of Jiang Buyi’s actions.</p><p>“Demi-Saint Jiang, I meant…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou began to make up for his previous words. After all, he only had one chance.</p><p>He considered his words and said firmly, “Even the most capable people can not do all things. However, I can rely on my background to pull strings for you. I will move forward step by step… You want to use me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought, “Now that you want an answer, I’ll give you an answer. Anyway, what you want is nothing more than me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly straightened his body and became neither servile nor overbearing. He had understood Jiang Buyi’s plan. To survive, he must not let the other party look down on him.</p><p>In the holy realm, the atmosphere seemed to have frozen after Xu Xiaoshou finished speaking.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s eyes were burning as he stared at Xu Xiaoshou, and Xu Xiaoshou faced him without fear.</p><p>The silence only lasted for less than three breaths.</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>Jiang Buyi laughed out loud and shook his head. “Xu Xiaoshou, you really live up to your reputation. You have such knowledge at such a young age. You are worthy of great responsibility!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s true body, which was in a disappearing state, suddenly let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>The burden in his heart was finally put down.</p><p>He still clenched the Communication Talisman tightly, but he steadily controlled the portrait clone that only had half a body left. He asked in confusion, “But senior, there’s still something I don’t understand.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi did not hide the admiration in his eyes as he raised his hand and said, “Say it.”</p><p>“You have indeed made an enemy of Holy Divine Palace because of me. This is a big problem. But why don’t you kill me and even want to use me?”</p><p>“Huh!” Jiang Buyi raised his head and laughed. “Do I look like a stingy person?”</p><p>“Not look like, but you are…” Xu Xiaoshou criticized in his heart. He clearly remembered that Jiang Buyi spat after being scolded. To save his face, he killed that subordinate in front of Rao Yaoyao without any mercy.</p><p>Jiang Buyi seemed to know the thoughts of the junior in front of him, but he still continued to praise him.</p><p>He said, “Impulsive courage of an ordinary man will only lead to endless trouble. The conflict between Teng Shanhai and me was indeed caused by you, but I killed him for another reason. It has nothing to do with you.”</p><p>“I can distinguish between kindness and hatred. You are different. You are so different from Teng Shanhai!”</p><p>“At such a young age, you even dared to use me and even succeeded. With your intelligence and courage, in my eyes, ten thousand men like Teng Shanhai are not even worth a single finger of yours.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi sighed with emotion as he thought of the younger generation in the clan.</p><p>However, even Jiang Xian, who was well-known among the younger generation, could only be a yes-man in front of him. Compared to Xu Xiaoshou, he was simply a loser.</p><p>It was the Saint Servant’s fault for discovering such talent early.</p><p>But it didn’t matter. The chess piece had no name. As long as one could, dared to think, and was willing to do it, one could even control the opponent’s chess moves, let alone take a chess piece over.</p><p>“Praised, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Liked, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>The Information Bar moved wildly, and Xu Xiaoshou was really flattered.</p><p>He did not expect that Jiang Buyi would not only not kill him but would also give him such a high evaluation. At that moment, he could only show an expression of being flattered to meet someone who could discover his potential.</p><p>“Senior, you flatter me.” Xu Xiaoshou cupped his hands and couldn’t help but laugh.</p><p>The smile on Jiang Buyi’s face suddenly disappeared. He said seriously, “However, someone as smart as you should also understand one thing. If you can’t be used by me, I would rather kill you than give you up to someone else.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was suddenly petrified in the air.</p><p>“Threatened, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>At this moment, he could feel the extreme killing intent from Jiang Buyi. He finally understood why Jiang Buyi had praised him.</p><p>He would not allow the threat to remain.</p><p>Jiang Buyi gently nodded. Seeing that Xu Xiaoshou had understood his meaning, he restrained his killing intent, and his face became friendly again.</p><p>Finally, he asked gently, “So, I’ll give you three breaths to make a choice. Do you want to die miserably? Or do you want to leave with me with dignity and enjoy endless wealth?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
