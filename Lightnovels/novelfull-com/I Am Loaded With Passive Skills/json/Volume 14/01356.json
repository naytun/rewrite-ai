As soon as there were any signs of it, he would first disappear, then retreat back into his Yuan Mansion.</p><p>“Was that an indication of the Void Attendant’s arrival?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s lips curled into a sneer, as if the big fish was finally going to bite the bait after having waited for such a long time.</p><p>He did not want to carry the Void Suppression Stele anymore.</p><p>This was not in line with Jiang Buyi’s identity, so it would be better for him to wait here.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>Not long after, he heard the sound of a slight whistle of the wind behind him.</p><p>Xu Xaoshou’s expression was calm as he stood with his hands behind his back and stroked his beard.</p><p>“You’re here?”</p><p>The black shadow behind him disappeared in his ‘Perception’, and revealed the person standing there.</p><p>He wore the Cang God Armor, had a single eye which was as sharp as an eagle’s, was as tall as a giant, and had an aura that covered the heavens-Teng Shanhai!</p><p>“How could it be you?” Xu Xiaoshou really didn’t expect that the first visitor he had been waiting for would not be the Void Attendant, but the head of a Combat Division, Teng Shanhai, who had once fought with him!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t move. His back faced the other party, and he didn’t even turn his head.</p><p>However, Teng Shanhai’s one sentence was enough to break through his defense.</p><p>He looked at the white-haired Elder in front of him in a daze and as he felt the faint aura of the Holy Power on his body, he said in disbelief,</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>+ Fear received. Passive Points +1.</p><p>+ Suspected. Passive Points +1.</p><p>+Acknowledged. Passive Points+1.</p><p>The information bar jumped quickly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>“Was he crazy?”</p><p>“You one-eyed man, which eye did you use to see that I’m Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“I am Jiang Buyi!”</p><p>“Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi of the Jiang clan in Pu Xuan Northern Region!”</p><p>At a certain moment, Xu Xiaoshou even suspected that he had made a mistake. He used his ‘Perception’ to size himself up, and thought that perhaps he had forgotten to hide the Fourth Sword.</p><p>But to no avail.</p><p>Judging from its appearance inferred from the Holy Power…</p><p>He looked like the Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi, so much so that even Jiang Xian had to acknowledge him as his great-grandfather!</p><p>“Then why did Teng Shanhai call out his real name?”</p><p>“Little brat!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was in turmoil, but his face was as calm as an ancient well. He turned around calmly and in a slightly surprised tone, said “If I remember correctly, you are Teng Shanhai, a kid from the Holy Divine Palace?”</p><p>“Jiang….”</p><p>When Teng Shanhai saw the face clearly, his face tensed up and his pupils shrank. He suddenly bent down and lowered his head, “Junior here sends greetings, Demi-Saint Jiang!”</p><p>“Huh…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou heaved a sigh of relief in his heart.</p><p>“Damn, that was so scary. So it was you, Teng Shanhai, who was scared out of your wits by the ‘ever-changing Xu Xiaoshou’, not that you recognized my true form?”</p><p>However, before he could continue with his bluff, Teng Shanhai, who was bent over, suddenly straightened up and there was ferocity and madness reflected in his single eye.</p><p>He took out a bottle of Holy Blood from his Spatial Ring, poured it out, and swallowed it. At the same time, he strode forward and a Bounded Domain appeared around him, which sealed off all the escape routes of anyone opposite him.</p><p>This action was done swiftly in one go, as if it had been rehearsed in his mind countless times.</p><p>He felt the aura on his body rising rapidly.</p><p>The Energy Reserve of the Saint Stage rose rapidly.</p><p>Finally, Teng Shanhai cackled hideously as his eyes filled with an oppressive murderous intent</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“Hahahaha, keep up your act, Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“This time, if I don’t bring you down, my surname isn’t Teng!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
