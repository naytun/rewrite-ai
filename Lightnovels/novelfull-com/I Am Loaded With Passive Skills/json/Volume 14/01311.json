Either his arms turned into metal, or his body suddenly exploded into pieces and then reassembled itself as he walked.</p><p>Lei Xi’er did not even need to think to know that Xu Xiaoshou was experimenting with the new ability he had just obtained.</p><p>This guy…</p><p>Ever since he had obtained the Imitator Form, his cultivation level had not improved. However, he had all kinds of strange and wonderful abilities which increased day by day.</p><p>Now that Xu Xiaoshou had enough of playing with his body, he actually transformed his left hand into a golden Alchemy Cauldron, while he used his right hand to produce the Infernal White Flame. Like a madman, he began to burn the golden cauldron.</p><p>“Conducting Alchemy, isn’t that obvious?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou increased the temperature of the Alchemy Cauldron in his left hand and said without even turning his head.</p><p>“This, is your body…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was speechless. He said that he was performing his Conducting Alchemy, but the Alchemy Cauldron was a transformation of his body. Wasn’t this refining himself?</p><p>“The highest-level Elixir Master uses the Heaven and Earth as a furnace to refine all things. I can’t do that yet. I’m just a Sovereign Stage Elixir Master, so I can only use my body as a furnace to refine Spiritual Medicine,” Xu Xiaoshou said indifferently.</p><p>“… Just go ahead and do it!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er didn’t want to bother with him anymore.</p><p>However, even though she couldn’t bear it, she remembered that the true Descendant of the Infernal Lineage had grown up eating Fire Seed since young.</p><p>This little bit of temperature could even burn up the Energy Reserve.</p><p>Now that the surface of his body was being burned, it was obviously not a problem for Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Monster.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er muttered silently.</p><p>She was also from the Infernal Lineage and was a disciple of Elder Sang who had held a disciple-accepting ceremony. However, she did not have the Infernal White Flame, so she could not understand people from this lineage whose brains had been burned.</p><p>They continued forward.</p><p>After stepping into the Forest of Miracles, the medicinal fragrance grew increasingly stronger.</p><p>Lei Xi’er also became more vigilant as she walked. She was afraid that another big foot would suddenly step out of this space in this ancient forest. Then, the Void Attendant would come again and question why the two of them had barged into the forest.</p><p>At this time, Xu Xiaoshou was still carelessly practicing his Conducting Alchemy…</p><p>“Why are you still practicing Conducting Alchemy?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er couldn’t hold it in anymore.</p><p>How could Xu Xiaoshou be so bold?</p><p>The Higher Void level had just been defeated, wasn’t he afraid of encountering another one?</p><p>“If the Higher Void level was in its peak state, even though his plan was good, it would be very difficult to carry it out!”</p><p>“Don’t underestimate this thing. I call it the ‘Saint Refining Pill’. It’s a fourth grade Sovereign Pill. I just created it, isn’t it amazing?” Xu Xiaoshou was proud of himself.</p><p>“He just created it…” Lei Xi’er’s eyes were filled with vigilance. “It can be eaten?”</p><p>“Yes, but it’s useless to eat it on its own. It has to be combined with the Holy Miracle Fruit in order not to waste the medicinal properties of the Elixirs…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paused after he spoke. He thought for a moment and said, “Hmm, I should put it another way. The Holy Miracle Fruit has to be combined with this Pill of mine in order not to waste it properties.”</p><p>During the process of Soul Reading, the image of the Double Dumba*s wasting more than 90% of the medicinal properties of the Holy Miracle fruit was still vivid in his mind.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t want to waste such a precious treasure!</p><p>What he was researching now was to combine the Spiritual Medicine of ‘Cooking Expert’ with the high-grade Spiritual Medicine planted in his Yuan Mansion world to create elixirs that were the most suitable for consuming with the Holy Miracle Fruit.</p><p>Combining Conducting Alchemy with the Saint Refining Pill couldn’t even compare to the cultivation of a Master Stage at the Sixth Rank.</p><p>However, once there was a Holy Miracle Fruit, the elixirs would lock the medicinal power of the Holy Miracle Fruit firmly in the Energy Reserve. Together with the cultivation method of a Spiritual Cultivator, it would absorb the Holy Power better.</p><p>The fixed rank was at the Sovereign Stage, but it was not an exaggeration to say that the medicinal efficacy was that of a supplementary Saint Pill.</p><p>Because at present, Xu Xiaoshou was certain that there were absolutely no Elixirs on the market that could be used with the Holy Miracle Fruit — except for the Holy Miracle Fruit on the Abyss Island, which had long been extinct on the Shengshen continent!</p><p>“It’s coming.”</p><p>Not long after, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly stopped and stared very cautiously at the golden cauldron in his left hand. He had never shown such a serious expression even when he faced Double Dumba*s.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er looked at this familiar scene and took a deep breath. She quickly retreated with Greedy the Cat Spirit in her arms.</p><p>As expected, in the next second, with a boom, a mushroom-shaped cloud soared into the sky and pushed open the spatial space in the sky and blew up the area within a radius of a few miles of it into pieces.</p><p>Then, an excited voice came from the dust.</p><p>“Cough, cough, cough!”</p><p>“Lei Xi’er, I succeeded! I did it in one go, as expected of me!”</p><p>“Saint-Refining Pill, a fourth grade Sovereign Pill, and it’s just been developed… looks like my Conducting Alchemy skills have improved again!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er looked gloomily at Xu Xiaoshou, who had rushed out from the dust with a face streaked with dust. She thought to herself, “You’ve improved your explosive abilities again. Even when you fought with Double Dumba*s just now, you were not in such a sorry state.”</p><p>However…</p><p>Looking at the ancient forest that had been blasted into pieces, Lei Xi’er muttered to herself.</p><p>“Could a fourth grade Sovereign Stage Elixir’s explosive power be so great already?”</p><p>If this was the case, if Xu Xiaoshou’s Conducting Alchemy skills were to be pushed up another level or two, did it mean that in future, he would not need to use his body and sword in a fight? He could just erect an Alchemy Cauldron in front of the enemy and use the Conducting Alchemy skill.</p><p>“Enemy interference?”</p><p>Interference was even better. This would make it easier for the cauldron explosion to be set off.</p><p>Perhaps a strange scene would appear because of this…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
