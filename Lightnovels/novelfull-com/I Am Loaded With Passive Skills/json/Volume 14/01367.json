At the same time, the space on Abyss Island was used as a barrier to prevent it from being blasted into spatial fragments.</p><p>“How perfect was this sort of power control?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt like his horizons had been broadened again.</p><p>Natural space was extremely fragile for a Sovereign Dao Realm expert, let alone a Demi-Saint’s attack.</p><p>However, Jiang Buyi’s attack was still able to accurately block the fragile space, which forced the Void Attendant to retreat a hundred miles within the Arena and not get eliminated.</p><p>In other words, the power of Jiang Buyi’s attack was completely channeled onto the body of the Void Attendant?</p><p>Only then did his thoughts flash past.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>The Void Attendant who was a hundred miles away suddenly exploded with a thunderous sound. Then, its huge body split open and black blood sprayed in all directions.</p><p>“Woah!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes bulged, but he was too tired to make any comments.</p><p>It was just as he had thought. Even the Void Attendant’s body could not withstand the hidden force of the Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi’s attack. This was way too frustrating!</p><p>“Was this the monster I wanted to deal with before?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou scratched his numb scalp. He swore in his heart that he would never provoke a Demi-Saint unless he was at the Sovereign Sage and had already mastered a divine skill that surpassed the ‘Vanishing Technique’ to escape from the hands of a Demi-Saint!</p><p>Killing his way up the Saint mountain suddenly became only a distant wish.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly realized that he had been frightened to death.</p><p>When people were weak, what they were most afraid of was seeing the strongest ability in the world, so much so that they would feel despair after they perceived the difference between cloud and mud and would no longer have the energy to pursue it.</p><p>A similar thought had just emerged in his mind, but Xu Xiaoshou immediately killed it.</p><p>He was not any ordinary person. He had the Passive System. Once he was at the Sovereign Stage, Jiang Buyi’s power might look strong, but it would not be something that he would not be able to catch up to.</p><p>Yes!</p><p>The Demi-Saint was strong!</p><p>But in the Shengshen Continent, it was not something that could not be solved.</p><p>Bazhun’an who was at the Sword Deity Realm had fallen on the Inner island of Abyss Island. He might not have been in his prime condition, but he could still suppress everything with his swordsmanship.</p><p>Didn’t this mean that as long as he did not give up the path of the Ancient Swordsman, as long as he cultivated well, he would be able to suppress the power displayed by Jiang Buyi?</p><p>“And what I have is not only the Ancient Sword Technique…”</p><p>It took Xu Xiaoshou a long time to barely stabilize his almost-collapsed state of mind.</p><p>He felt that this lesson was worth it.</p><p>He didn’t have to pay any tuition fees. He just hid in the dark and observed the Demi-Saint’s attack from such a close distance.</p><p>Even if it wasn’t his full strength, it still gave him a direction to work toward.</p><p>If Jiang Buyi was like this, then how bad would the group of freaks on the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe be?</p><p>Elder Sang was still waiting silently in the Dead Sea. His boast about his Sovereign Stage killing at the Sacred Mountain at the seaport, could he retract it?</p><p>“The road is long, but the cultivation is far away.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou mumbled silently, but his eyes became determined after his mental state stabilized. “I will search everywhere!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Pah.”</p><p>In the battle, a wave of his hand forced the dark giant to retreat three thousand feet.</p><p>Jiang Buyi extended his left hand and caught the Spiritual Cultivator who had fallen from the Void Attendant’s hand.</p><p>The Void Attendant was too slow-witted and could not answer.</p><p>People of the same kind would always talk.</p><p>“He’s still alive…”</p><p>Jiang Buyi sensed that the person in his hand was still breathing. He guessed that the armor had saved his life.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>When he held the blood-stained armor, Jiang Buyi suddenly felt that something was wrong. The aura of this armor seemed rather familiar.</p><p>“Cang God Armor?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi extended his hand and wiped off the blood on the helmet of the person in his hand. He easily saw a single eye.</p><p>This time, his eyelids twitched.</p><p>“Teng Shanhai?”</p><p>The Chief of the Combat Division of the Holy Divine Palace, Teng Shanhai!</p><p>Jiang Buyi could not believe the identity of the Spiritual Cultivator who had been tortured by the Void Attendant. He was actually from the Holy Divine Palace?</p><p>The last person he wanted to meet was someone from the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>In the Deep Sea, he had yet to clear his name from the mess that Situ Yongren had gotten him into, and the suspicion of his intention to meddle with the Holy Emperor person was still there.</p><p>At a certain moment, Jiang Buyi had the desire to kill.</p><p>He didn’t want to save Teng Shanhai. He didn’t care if such a minion died.</p><p>However, he was from the Holy Divine Palace, after all. He could not die in his hands. Otherwise, those people on the Saint Mountain might eventually trace it back to him through some means.</p><p>At that time, he, Jiang Buyi, would not be able to clear his name even if he jumped into the Yellow River.</p><p>I could not kill him, yet he fell into my hands…</p><p>“Wake up.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi sighed. He planned to befriend Teng Shanhai and use this as a breakthrough point to clear away the mess that Situ Yongren had landed him in.</p><p>However, through his Holy Power, when he used his ‘Perception’ to probe into Teng Shanhai’s condition, he immediately sensed how terrible Teng Shanhai’s injuries were.</p><p>His physical body had been completely destroyed by the Void Attendant, and he was still in a weak state even after he took the Holy Blood. His mental state was even more muddled and irrational after using a forbidden technique.</p><p>“Demonic Power…”</p><p>When he felt the remaining strength on Teng Shanhai’s only exposed right arm, Jiang Buyi’s heart palpitated.</p><p>In terms of quality, this power surpassed the Holy Power.</p><p>It was unknown how Teng Shanhai obtained it. However, with his current cultivation level, the price he had to pay was the current state he was in!</p><p>“It’s even more demonic than the ‘God-Devil Eyes’. In other words, it’s a power that can only be mastered after the ‘God-Devil Eyes’ is completed.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi was restless. He had the idea of killing and snatching the treasure.</p><p>After all, he had thrown out the bait of the God-Devil Eyes, but he had not been able to receive any benefits in return. He had even been tricked into coming to the Abyss Island.</p><p>There was no doubt that the power on Teng Shanhai’s body was extremely alluring!</p><p>But he was still a member of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>“How extravagant. A mere Chief of the Combat Division is able to control this kind of power.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi shook his head and sighed. Then, he fed Teng Shanhai some elixirs, gently patted his armor, and jolted him awake.</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>Teng Shanhai woke up in a daze. The first thing he saw was a kind-looking old face with a warm and gentle smile.</p><p>The fragments of memory flashed by and he suddenly understood what the current situation was.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“You son of a b*tch! Do you really think you can restrain me?”</p><p>After eating the God’s Blessing elixirs, Teng Shanhai recovered most of his injuries instantly. He stood up and, at a close distance, the power of Demon God erupted from his right arm as he suddenly struck out.</p><p>With a simple lift of his jaw, he ruthlessly smashed Jiang Buyi’s chin, who exercised his goodwill and was completely defenseless, to the sky!</p><p>Nearly…</p><p>Just a couple of inches more…</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s head was about to be hit and sent flying by the powerful Demon God’s arm!</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>The head did not fly away.</p><p>However, a tooth drew an elegant parabola in the air and took away the little bit of kindness that Jiang Buyi had forced out of his body for this person from the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>The world suddenly fell silent at this moment.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was speechless.</p><p>Teng Shanhai : “!!!…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was still hidden in mid-air, almost burst out laughing when he saw this.</p><p>This was truly too shocking!</p><p>“Teng Shanhai, I am willing to acknowledge this as the most glorious moment of your life!”</p><p>A question mark appeared on his face. As he looked at Teng Shanhai, who glared at him with his hands on his waist, Jiang Buyi’s face instantly turned black. He gritted his teeth and spat out in a deep and furious voice.</p><p>“You, are, seeking, death!”</p><p>The sound settled.</p><p>Thunder rumbled in the clear sky. Black clouds gathered in the sky, and it turned dark.</p><p>A gust of wind blew from ten thousand miles away and brushed against Jiang Buyi’s white robe and his gloomy expression appeared even more shocking.</p><p>When a Demi-Saint was angry, the world changed!</p><p>“Huh.”</p><p>Teng Shanhai sneered.</p><p>“Not bad, your aura is really imposing. I’m giving you face, Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Outsiders might be afraid, but he, Teng Shanhai, wasn’t afraid at all.</p><p>Although the Heavens and Earth suddenly underwent such a Transformation, and he himself had been mysteriously injured and woken up, Teng Shanhai was clueless about everything.</p><p>But were all these important?</p><p>Not important!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou mattered most!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could dress up as God and play the Devil and obviously had many tricks up his sleeve. If it was just this, how could Teng Shanhai be scared?</p><p>“How can I, Teng Shanhai, be so easily scared?”</p><p>Knowing that the person in front of him was Xu Xiaoshou, Teng Shanhai did not care about the small Transformation that occurred in the world.</p><p>He let go of his hands and recalled the Xiao Divine Spear that was nowhere to be found.</p><p>Then, he raised his Spear in the air and looked at the Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi, who had wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and who had swiftly retreated to a safe distance from him. He was shocked, embarrassed, and angry. He sneered and threw out the Weapon Prohibition order.</p><p>“Although I don’t know why you dared to get close to me, I will give you this chance. Put on the Weapon Prohibition Order obediently and follow me back to the Dead Sea at Saint Mountain. If you surrender, I will spare your miserable life!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
