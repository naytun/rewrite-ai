Master Siren has indeed mastered Nine Major Sword Techniques. This is definitely an ability that he has gained after so many years of teaching. He knows everything! ”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was overwhelmed.</p><p>Didn’t this mean that Mei Siren and Bazhun’an were on the same level?</p><p>“Who is more powerful… You or Master Siren?” Ye Xiaotian asked.</p><p>Xiao Yingying didn’t look that excited anymore. Instead, he knitted his eyebrows, not knowing what to say.</p><p>“Is he seriously more…” Ye Xiaotian was shocked. Did it mean that Bazhun’an was just a junior and couldn’t compare to those seniors?</p><p>“You can’t compare Way of the Sword like this, ” Xiao Kongtong answered with a careful tone.</p><p>“What about Present Gods and Buddhas?” Ye Xiaotian thought about what he had seen from Bazhun’an in the Eighth Palace and compared it to what was happening at the moment. He felt that he already had the answer.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong thought for a while and said, “Of course, you think Master Siren’s Present Gods and Buddhas are better than his.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Ye Xiaotian asked with raised brows.</p><p>Xiao Chengcheng laughed and said confidently,” There is something you, and even the whole world, don’t know. His Heart Sword Technique isn’t ordinary!”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“Have you heard of 21 Famed Swords?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Have you heard of Heavenly Unravel of the famed sword?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xiao Yingying lowered his voice. He didn’t want to talk about this at first, but he couldn’t bear to see his Teacher being looked down on. “His Present Gods and Buddhas change according to his enemies and can also activate Heavenly Unravel!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was speechless.</p><p>With the back of his left hand on his lip, Xiao Kongtong said without turning his head. “You might be dumb, but you should know the famed swords has several Heavenly Unravel, right??”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s eyes widened in shock.</p><p>What did Xiao Kongtong mean by that?</p><p>What was he trying to say?</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s lips curled into a smile, and he chuckled. “His Present Gods and Buddhas can reach three stages of Heavenly Unravel. I’ve witnessed the process before!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was astonished.</p><p>“Are you kidding me?”</p><p>“Haha, what would I lie to you? This is a secret. Don’t tell anyone.” Xiao Kongtong knew that he had let it slip again, so he immediately decided to stop the discussion.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian felt like his head was about to explode.</p><p>The masked man who had cut off his arm in Tiansang Spirit Palace came to his mind.</p><p>He had thought that with the final stage of Spatial Upanishad, no matter how strong Bazhun’an was, they could have a try.</p><p>However…</p><p>“Alas…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian heaved a long sigh of relief and tried his best to relax. Elder Sang was right. Living in Tiansang Spirit Palace for years had made him a frog in the well.</p><p>He still didn’t believe it, mustered his courage, and asked again, “All the ancient swordsmen are this powerful? Can Present Gods and Buddhas always reach Heavenly Unravel?”</p><p>“No, no, no…” Xiao Kongtong immediately waved his hand. “Only two people in this world can do it. ”</p><p>“Oh?” Ye Xiaotian was more relieved, but he soon turned anxious, sized up the man before him, and asked suspiciously, “That was how you resist the demi-saint’s Ten Aura.”</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong laughed as if he was flattered., but he quickly shook his head. “You misunderstood. I’m not that strong. I can’t even compare to Master Siren, let alone master Heavenly Unravel of Present Gods and Buddhas. ”</p><p>“Who is the other person?” Ye Xiaotian was slightly taken aback. He looked at the monster in the distance and thought to himself, “No way! It’s already so terrifying. How can it still evolve?’</p><p>“It’s not Master Siren.”</p><p>Xiao Youyou didn’t want to string him along and said firmly, “The head of Seven Sword Deity, You Tu!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian fell silent.</p><p>He suddenly felt powerless.</p><p>It was true that there was always someone better.</p><p>It turned out that being at the final stage of Spatial Upanishad didn’t guarantee being able to fight against or defeat anyone at the higher void level.</p><p>He knew many higher void-level cultivators who could fight against demi-saints, so a Spatial Upanishad one like him was no match for them.</p><p>“Are you frustrated?” Xiao Kongtong looked at him with a smile.</p><p>“A little bit. I should have been more than this…” Ye Xiaotian opened up, which was rare. He felt that he had wasted too much time. If he hadn’t been to Abyss Island, he might have wasted even more time in the future.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong patted his shoulder. “Cheer up. What you’ve mastered will be a qualitative leap with every step you take in the future, so I am sure you will reach the higher void level and defeat a demi-saint one day!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian rolled his eyes. Why did these words sound sarcastic? Was Xiao Kongtong mocking him?</p><p>“Let’s go. Master Siren must be the backup Teacher left for Xu Xiaoshou. With him here, we might not even need to do anything but support them.” Xiao Kongtong stepped forward with a smile.</p><p>The Stone Giants were about to catch up again. If it weren’t for the overflowing Holy Power stopping them, Ye Xiaotian and Xiao Kongtong wouldn’t have had the time to stop and chat.</p><p>“Support them…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian followed behind him but felt somewhat bitter.</p><p>Master Siren was so powerful, so they were just nothing! How could they be the support? They would only make themselves jokes.</p><p>“Come on! Don’t be upset” Xiao Kongtong still kept a bright smile. “Nothing can stop a swordsman. I am not kidding.”</p><p>“Besides…” He paused. “You got me, right?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong pointed at himself with a smile, “With Master Siren here, we might not need to do anything. The price of me doing something is too high. If I don’t do anything, it will be easier for us to suppress the demi-saint. Am I right?” He winked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
