Its main effect is to numb the body and reduce the sensitivity. It can only be used in conjunction with the Breathing Technique.”</p><p>“If anyone else takes it, they might die on the spot, hehe.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou carefully examined the Numbing Elixir. After some thought, he summoned Greedy the Cat Spirit. With a first-grade Spiritual Medicine as an exchange, he easily turned the ‘white cat’ into a ‘white mouse.’</p><p>“Meow…”</p><p>Poor Greedy the Cat Spirit was not aware of anything at all. It had been bribed with a stalk of Spiritual Medicine. It consumed the Elixir in high spirits and then fell to the ground, its mouth covered with white foam.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the little fat cat, who did not use his ‘Swallow’ power and now lay paralyzed on the ground and he fell into deep thought.</p><p>“Damn, it’s indeed a little poisonous.”</p><p>“But if I can neutralize it with my body, it should be able to remove the ‘sensitivity’, right?”</p><p>It had been a long time, but the after effects had not been removed. Xu Xiaoshou was still weak. Under such circumstances, he no longer hesitated. As he stared at the sluggish state of Greedy the Cat Spirit, he gritted his teeth, took out another Numbing Elixir and swallowed it.</p><p>After all, if he had this sensitive body, not to mention meeting a Void Attendant after he left the Yuan Mansion, he could run into anyone, or even be blown away by the wind.</p><p>As long as he failed to control his clothes, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he would be charged in half a second!</p><p>Half a second.</p><p>That long!</p><p>At that time, he would probably not even know how he died!</p><p>As soon as the fifth-grade Numbing Elixir entered his mouth, it immediately turned into poisonous gas that invaded his entire body. Xu Xiaoshou felt that he was about to react.</p><p>In the next second, the ‘Transformation’ noticed the invasion of the Yi energy, so it directly turned the poisonous energy into a non- attribute Spiritual Source and injected it into his Energy Reserve</p><p>Xu Xiashou : “???”</p><p>“Damn!”</p><p>“I took so much effort to develop this Poisonous Pill, and you destroyed it so easily?”</p><p>He tried another one and found that as long as there was any Yi energy introduced to the body, it would trigger the passive ‘Transformation’ skill.</p><p>The reason why it was called a passive skill was that Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t control the ‘On’ or ‘Off’ aspect of this skill.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gnashed his teeth in anger.</p><p>The peerless Elixir had just appeared and it died just like that?</p><p>This was really terrible news.</p><p>The only benefit he could get from the Numbing Elixir was that as long as the ‘Transformation’ skill was there, he wouldn’t have to fear most of the Poisonous Pills and poison energy attacks in the future.</p><p>“Forget it, forget it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s resistance was futile, and he could only let his sensitive body continue to be sensitive.</p><p>He did not make any more unnecessary attempts and continued to study his Energy Reserve.</p><p>After he broke through to the Star Worship State, his Holy Power would emerge, and his title as the number one Master Stage below the Dem-Saint realm would remain as such.</p><p>However, the Holy Power was only the inevitable power that came with eating the Holy Miracle Fruit. Xu Xiaoshou did not forget that most of the other powers of the Holy Miracle Fruit had not been added into his cultivation. It must have been stolen by some thief in his Energy Reserve.</p><p>“Who could have stolen it?”</p><p>He thought deeply about it and he placed the blame squarely on the Infernal Original Seed.</p><p>In the White Cave, Xu Xiaoshou had used the power of the Wretched Saint to suppress this treasure.</p><p>At the end of the Conducting Alchemy convention, when he received the champion’s reward, the Little Blue Flower of the Tranquil Lake, also known as the ‘little Heavenly Flame’, Xu Xiaoshou discovered the power of this little Heavenly Flame was actually slightly comparable to the Infernal Original Seed.</p><p>The Infernal Original Seed was almost equivalent to the Three Days Frozen Calamity which was equivalent to the power of the true Heavenly Flame.</p><p>The Heavenly Flame was also born from the Ashvatta, one of the Nine Great Ancestral Trees. Theoretically speaking, it should not be inferior to a Saint Stage treasure. How could it be equal to the Little Blue Flower of the Tranquil Lake?</p><p>In the past, Xu Xiaoshou could only use the power of the two treasures, the Infernal Original Seed and the Three Days Frozen Calamity, which were barely at the Cutting Path Stage.</p><p>The greatest advantage was to make use of the calamity power of the Three Days Frozen Calamity and the Infernal Original Seed. It was a very good springboard for him to jump levels and for fights.</p><p>Finally, with the Little Blue Flower of the Tranquil Lake as a comparison, Xu Xiaoshou had obtained true powers such as the Infernal Original Seed and the Three Days Frozen Calamity. He should still be in a sealed state.</p><p>Just like the Demi-Saints in in the Shengshen Continent, ordinary people could not catch a glimpse of them in their entire lives.</p><p>For example, Sovereign Stage treasures could be seen frequently, but Saint Martial Art and Holy Weapons were rarely seen.</p><p>Take the 21 Famed Swords as an example. In theory, all of them were able to perform the Heavenly Unravel. However, up until now, Xu Xiaoshou had not seen even one person who could comprehend the Heavenly Unravel power of the Famed Swords and erupt with the Saint-Stage Combat Strength that the so-called famed swords had.</p><p>“The treasure is concealing itself?”</p><p>With this understanding, Xu Xiaoshou went to observe the state of the Infernal Original Seed and was shocked to find that the Energy Reserve…</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>What he observed was that what the Infernal Original Seed emitted now was a kind of sporadic Calamity Power unlike in the past.</p><p>On the contrary, the Cutting Path’s calamity aura was too strong!</p><p>Not only that, but this seemed to be just the beginning.</p><p>From the core of the Original Infernal Seed that was like a compressed sun, he could feel a supreme power that was no less powerful than the Holy Power of the Holy Miracle Fruit.</p><p>“The Saint Stage power!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>“So, the Infernal Original Seed secretly stole the medicinal power of the Holy Miracle Fruit and unlocked the hidden attributes of its own treasure, and bloomed with the true light of its Saint Stage Supreme Treasure?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
