Is that why its seal broke and it’s showing off its strength now?”</p><p>Above the Energy Reserve.</p><p>The Holy Miracle Fruit’s accompanying Holy Power, the Infernal Original Seed and the Three Days Frozen Calamity were now like a three-legged tripod stand.</p><p>Perceptibly, with the Infernal Original Seed and the Three Days Frozen Calamity as the main force, even the Holy Power of the Holy Miracle Fruit was slightly weaker.</p><p>Below that was his Uncle’s Sword Cognition and Xu Xiaoshou’s own Sword Cognition, that he cultivated himself and also one that had not taken part in any competition before, might contain the will of the Wretched Saint, which was also the white Light Bead of the Great Infernal Ancestor.</p><p>“He must have eaten the medicinal power in order to break the seal!”</p><p>When he thought of this, Xu Xiaoshou immediately rejected his second conclusion.</p><p>If the Infernal Original Seed’s edges were so sharp, he thought it could be due to the Double Dumba*s full power.</p><p>But…</p><p>The same went for the Three Days Frozen Calamity!</p><p>This true Heavenly Flame now exuded its true power.</p><p>More than one-third of the area above the Energy Reserve was dyed an icy blue.</p><p>“I didn’t really use the Three Days Frozen Calamity. I cooperated with Ice to fight the Double Dumba*s so it can have a better eruption. The seal couldn’t have been broken because of a fight.”</p><p>“So, like the Infernal Original Seed, it surreptitiously ate most of the Holy Miracle Fruit’s ‘medicinal power’, which was why my cultivation level was unable to break through to the final-stage of the Star Worship State.”</p><p>“In the end, it was given to me as the ‘Infernal Original Seed’ and ‘Three Days Frozen Calamity’, which completely released the power of the Saint-Stage treasure?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s index finger manifested the power of the Infernal Original Seed, which was a kind of Holy Power fluctuation.</p><p>Then, the power of the Three-Day Frozen Calamity appeared on his middle finger, which was another kind of Holy Power fluctuation.</p><p>Later, the power of Holy Miracle Fruit’s accompanying Holy Power appeared on his ring finger, and it still had the Holy Power fluctuation!</p><p>A total of three Saint-Stage powers. If they were to be compressed and detonated…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was ecstatic!</p><p>This deal was simply too advantageous!</p><p>The Holy Miracle Fruit’s medicinal power?</p><p>Eat it!</p><p>Eat whatever you want! Just eat!</p><p>I still have an entire garden of Holy Medicine!</p><p>However, after he ate just a small amount, the power of the two Saint Stage treasures was completely released, which was a pleasant surprise.</p><p>Before this, the only things that Xu Xiaoshou had that were related to the word ‘Saint’ were the Holy Statue and the Holy Blood that Elder Sang gave him.</p><p>Now, a single Miracle Fruit had three additional Saint Stage powers!</p><p>“Cool!”</p><p>He looked at the three super Saint seeds that were compressed on his three fingers.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of a Spiritual Technique that had accompanied him for a period of time in the past, but was later eliminated due to his rapid progress.</p><p>“Seeds on All Five Fingers!”</p><p>Now, with three fingers, he had three Saint Stage powers. He was still short of two…</p><p>“Oh,”</p><p>His ring finger twitched.</p><p>It could reach the level of the second generation’s Penetrating Divine Senses and suppress the power of the Saint Stage. However, because he had not cultivated it for long, it could not compare with the power of the Saint Stage for the time being. However, the Sword Cognition that could kill anything under the Demi-Saint realm turned into a Sword Cognition seed and jumped out of his fingertips.</p><p>“Oh,”</p><p>His thumb twitched again.</p><p>The Little Blue Flower of the Tranquil Lake, also known as the ‘little Heavenly Flame’ which was only one level weaker than the Saint Stage, turned into another Fire Seed and jumped out.</p><p>“Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang!”</p><p>The refined power had just appeared at the tip of the five fingers, and the surrounding air exploded. Even the space around the fingers had faint black spatial cracks.</p><p>“How terrifying!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyelids twitched.</p><p>He had just turned his imagination into reality. He had just condensed five seeds of power and had not done much power compression, friction, and fusion yet.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that the explosive force contained in it was far beyond any explosion he had ever created!</p><p>However, on second thought, it seemed to be true.</p><p>The Holy Blood could only grant the user a Saint Stage power.</p><p>In his own body, the accompanying Holy Power of the Holy Miracle Fruit was not lesser than this.</p><p>Now, he had also added two more versions of Infernal Original Seed, which were comparable to the peak power of Holy Blood, the Saint-Stage power of the Three-Day Frozen Calamity, and the pseudo Saint Stage powers of the Sword Cognition and the Little Blue Flower of the Tranquil Lake.</p><p>“It’s not too much to call you the ‘Seeds on all Five Fingers’ Saint, right?”</p><p>Xushou’s face was filled with fanaticism, like an artist who had seen the most beautiful art.</p><p>He felt that if this attack were to hit any Higher Void level, it would be no different if he were to squeeze five different drops of Holy Blood at the same time, and then let all his emotions erupt with one blow.</p><p>“Who can take this?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that his own body could not even take it, let alone others.</p><p>Even if he didn’t use the Seeds on all Five Fingers technique, he could feel that his body would be blown to pieces by the backlash of the power.</p><p>It was just like how he had used the power of the Saint Statue to receive Teng Shanhai’s Xiao Divine Spear in Dongtianwang City.</p><p>“Buzz…”</p><p>The residual power of the five energy seeds rubbed against each other, which generated electricity in the Void and sparks flew out.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could feel that his fingertips were in the midst of a reincarnation, as it repeatedly cracked and healed in turn.</p><p>“There’s still something missing.”</p><p>His lips pursed, Xu Xiaoshou was still not satisfied!</p><p>When he thought of Teng Shanhai, he thought of the possibility that if he used this move, he would be the first to die.</p><p>Naturally, he also thought of the Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand that he had subconsciously used when he took the Xiao Divine Spear.</p><p>It came from Elder Sang, who had taught him this unique skill that had made him famous in the Eighth Palace.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
