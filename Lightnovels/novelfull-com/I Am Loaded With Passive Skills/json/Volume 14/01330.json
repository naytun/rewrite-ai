It had lost all rationality and jumped up immediately, pouncing towards the Herd Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>At this moment, it seemed to have completely forgotten what its master had told it.</p><p>It had no choice. The vitality spiritual energy and fragrance of spiritual herbs in front of it were too stimulating. Furthermore, Greedy the Cat Spirit was an alchemy cat.</p><p>However, the next second…</p><p>“Pia!”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit crashed into the barrier that enveloped the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>This was something that Xu Xiaoshou had constructed in the Yuan Mansion world. Without the approval of the world Lord, there was no way to break through.</p><p>Naturally, it was to prevent a certain cat from stealing the herbs.</p><p>“Meow meow meow!”</p><p>It could only look at the herbs longingly from a distance, unable to reach them. This made Greedy the Cat Spirit scratch its head anxiously.</p><p>This was too hateful, too hateful…</p><p>There were so many treasures in front of it. As long as it ate them all, it might even be able to reach the Sovereign realm.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit felt as if it had suddenly grown into a spiritual cultivator of the higher void stage. If it was not careful, it might even break through to demi-saint.</p><p>On the other side, Lei Xi’er was also staring at the herb garden in a daze.</p><p>She could still vaguely remember the conversation she had with Xu Xiaoshou on the ancient tree outside.</p><p>“How much did you get?”</p><p>“A little bit.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, how was this “a little bit”?</p><p>He almost moved the entire Herb Garden of Divine Farmer over!</p><p>“He’s crazy…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er calmed down with great difficulty. She walked out of the barrier that surrounded the herb garden. She stretched out her hand to try to break the barrier but found that her right hand had passed through it.</p><p>She was stunned for a moment, then her red lips curled up, and she walked into the herb garden with a smile.</p><p>“Meow meow meow!”</p><p>At the back, Greedy the Cat Spirit was even more frantic after seeing this scene.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Why could she go in, but it couldn’t?</p><p>This was not fair!</p><p>Lei Xi’er, who had entered the herb garden, had already forgotten that there was a cat behind her. Her attention was completely attracted by the spiritual energy and medicinal fragrance.</p><p>“This is crazy…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er could not help but sigh.</p><p>As far as she could see, they were all holy medicine.</p><p>She was just looking for the medicinal fragrance that she had found on Double Dumbass before, which was the Holy Miracle Fruit.</p><p>Lei Xi’er found no less than three or four Holy Miracle Fruits!</p><p>Yes, because…</p><p>It was not the fruit she found, but a fruit tree!</p><p>There were more or less five or six fruits hanging on each tree, and there were more than twenty in total.</p><p>“This is the Holy Miracle Fruit that Double Dumbass was so desperate to swallow?”</p><p>When Lei Xi’er came to the foot of the fruit tree, she couldn’t help but reach out to touch the human-head-sized fruit, but she didn’t pick it.</p><p>She was shocked by the great victory that Xu Xiaoshou’s greed had brought.</p><p>She also felt that it was not worth it for the likes of Double Dumbass and Hong Dang to pay the price of their lives for a single Holy Miracle Fruit.</p><p>This was because this amount of holy medicine was only a drop in the ocean in this new Herb Garden of Divine Farmer in the world of Yuan Mansion!</p><p>“Holy Miracle Fruit, Dragon Blood Grass, Black Bodhi Seed, Divine Saint cattail, Nine-Lives Soul Flower…”</p><p>As Lei Xi ‘er walked, she kept repeating the names of the holy medicines that she could still recognize. Her mind gradually became numb.</p><p>This was crazy!</p><p>This was too crazy!</p><p>She had received the memory inheritance of the entire Lei family, but even with this vast knowledge base, she still couldn’t find the names of all the holy medicines in the herb garden.</p><p>Here, Lei Xi’er only knew about one-third of the herbs.</p><p>As for the remaining two-thirds, not to mention seeing them, the entire Lei family had never even heard of them!</p><p>“Xu xiaoshou!”</p><p>The more she walked, the more shocked she was. The more shocked she was, the more she sighed at Xu Xiaoshou’s madness!</p><p>It was really the case of the bold dying from overeating and the small-minded starving to death.</p><p>While Double Dumba*s and Hong Dang were still fighting for a single Holy Miracle Fruit, Xu xiaoshou really dared to empty the entire Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>Was he really not afraid of death?</p><p>Perhaps touching a holy medicine would only attract the attention of the void attendants.</p><p>However, Lei Xi’er knew that if the entire Herb Garden of Divine Farmer was emptied, it might trigger some kind of taboo.</p><p>For example, Xu Xiaoshou would be locked on by Abyss Island forever, and it would be difficult for him to move forward.</p><p>Another example was that if he dared to show his face on Abyss Island again, all the void attendants in the city might wake up and hunt him down.</p><p>Although these were all assumptions, what if they were true?</p><p>If Lei Xi’er could think of it, she didn’t believe that Xu xiaoshou couldn’t think of it.</p><p>But…</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, he really dares to relocate the herb garden!”</p><p>While shaking her head and sighing, Lei Xi-er unknowingly walked to the center of the herb garden.</p><p>Soon, she stopped and stared at the Golden Apricot tree in front of her, which was still standing like a crane among a flock of chickens and shining with a golden light. She was completely stunned.</p><p>“This!”</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er looked at the Golden Apricot tree in disbelief, and her God Devil Eyes stopped working in shock.</p><p>The apricot tree was more than three meters tall. In the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, where ordinary fruit trees were dozens of meters tall, it could only be said to be unremarkable.</p><p>However, the power it emitted was too strong!</p><p>It had completely surpassed the level of ordinary holy medicine!</p><p>Lei Xi’er felt that even the power of the Holy Emperor was insignificant in front of this apricot tree.</p><p>“OWW~”</p><p>However, even though they were so close to each other and had yet to touch each other, Lei Xi’er could already hear the illusory Dragon’s Roar coming from the apricot tree.</p><p>Not only that, but every single one of the apricot trees was perfectly round with mysterious dragon patterns and blurry Dragon shadows. The medicinal power contained within them was a hundred times that of ordinary holy medicine!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
