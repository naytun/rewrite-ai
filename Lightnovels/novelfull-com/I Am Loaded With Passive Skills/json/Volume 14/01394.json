The Dao of the phantom is blocked by yin and yang, and the gate of hell is locked. Today, the sword opens the door, and here comes Hundred Ghost Night Walk.”</p><p>The sky turned dark.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was clearly in a disappearing state, but he still felt that he had entered the bounded domain of the night watch again, and his six senses were almost lost.</p><p>Nine Swords had just sealed the gate of hell. The dark objects that flew out from it were only illusionary sword shapes, which were all fake numbers derived from Nine Swords Technique.</p><p>Now, under the guidance of the Phantom Swords Technique, these dark objects and imaginary numbers all turned into ferocious ghosts that were baring their fangs and brandishing their claws.</p><p>The countless phantoms swaggered across the land, covering the sky and covering the sun.</p><p>Not only that, but Yama, who was under Mei Siren’s feet, also broke free of his shackles at the same time, stepped forward, and took the lead.</p><p>Yama led the way, and the other ghosts crossed the border as well.</p><p>Master Siren, who was controlling the ghosts, seemed to be possessed by Yama at this moment. Even his breath became extremely cold.</p><p>The sword had finally taken form!</p><p>In the end, Forest of Miracles became a picture with Hundred Ghost Night Walk. The forest was filled with ghosts and phantoms, and their shrills sent a chill down everyone’s back.</p><p>Hiss…</p><p>The ear-piercing scream was intimidating, and people couldn’t help but shiver.</p><p>“The first realm of Phantom Swords Technique, Spirits Controlling.”</p><p>Goosebumps crawled over Xu Xiaoshou’s body, and his pupils trembled as he watched.</p><p>This was the first time witnessing the Phantom Swords Technique of Nine Swords Technique, and he was scared out of his skin!</p><p>The Phantom Swords Technique that Master Siren displayed after he had spread out the two realms was too shocking!</p><p>Such a stunning sword! Could anyone, even if specialized in spiritual Yi, resist it for a second?</p><p>Had Jiang Buyi mastered the defense of the spirits and will?</p><p>Let’s say this.</p><p>With the help of the sword image, this sword could undoubtedly chop the demi-saint’s divine soul.</p><p>And the so-called demi-saint Jiang Buyi…</p><p>Did his spirit also have the highest level of defense of a demi-saint?</p><p>…</p><p>“We are lucky!”</p><p>A hundred miles away, two figures sneaked in from the rustling.</p><p>Under the dark sky, the cold moon hung in the sky. Xiao Kongtong looked at the night scene of Hundred Ghost Night Walk, and his whole body trembled with excitement.</p><p>“What… what the hell?” Ye Xiaotian was numb with shock.</p><p>What was happening?</p><p>They had only missed a few minutes, but Mei Siren had activated countless realms of the Nine Swords Technique.</p><p>Wasn’t it said that ancient swordsmen would find it difficult to learn the first realm of one of the Nine Major Sword Techniques in their entire lives? Why was it different for some cultivators?</p><p>How come he could activate this many realms as if it was a walk in the park?</p><p>“This is Master Siren!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong clutched the sack tightly, and his eyes fixed on the front. “People only see the gentle and elegant side of Master Siren, and no one knows about true color. He has always been like this since the beginning, but no one has ever made him use his sword.”</p><p>“Phantom Swords Technique?” Ye Xiaotian might not be a sharp person, but he could tell what it was after seeing the scene of Hundred Ghost Night Walk.</p><p>“Exactly.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong nodded and muttered with a thrilled tone, “The sword goes against yin and yang to open the gates of hell, and Yama steps into the mortal world. The collapse of reincarnation and Phantom City, the banners of the phantom, is undoubtedly the most orthodox Phantom Swords Technique. This is Spirits Controlling!”</p><p>“I understand that, but what are you talking about?” Ye Xiaotian was stunned.</p><p>Why did Xiao Kongtong keep saying these tongue-twisting mnemonic phrases about cultivation methods when it came to Nine Major Sword Techniques?</p><p>“Take a closer look, is the scene in front of you exactly as I said?” Xiao Kongtong didn’t explain, his eyes fixed on the scene, afraid to miss a single detail.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian looked at the scene again.</p><p>Nine Swords summoned by the sword image of Mei Siren had indeed set the gate of hell, and Yama, under his feet, had already rushed forward.</p><p>However…</p><p>“I can understand the first two sentences, but what about the rest? Where are the city and banners of Phantom?” the more Ye Xiaotian looked at them, the more terrified he felt. Ancient swordsmen were all insane.</p><p>“If you could see the scene of the last two sentences, you might be dead soon.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong didn’t even turn his head as he explained quickly, “This is the summary of the two realms after Teacher activated the Phantom Swords Technique first time in his life. The first part is the first realm of the Phantom Swords Technique, Spirit Controlling, and the second one is about the Lord of Phantom City.</p><p>“If Master Siren really reaches the level of Phantom City, the moment he activates it…”</p><p>“You and I will be affected, and our spirits will be forcibly controlled by the swordsman, becoming part of Hundred Ghost Night Walk to hurt others.</p><p>“Or, you will be the target of the swordsman, who needs to fight against the million spirits army of Phantom City!</p><p>“Such a sword strike can even take away ghosts and gods, let alone you, a little cultivator in the Sovereign Stage.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was speechless.</p><p>Everything was overwhelming for him!</p><p>The ancient swordsmen might be the craziest people he knew!</p><p>Did they get their soul attributes through acquired cultivation?</p><p>“But can he kill the demi-saint just with Spirits Controlling?” Why doesn’t Master Siren use the last two sentences you mentioned?” Ye Xiaotian asked.</p><p>“I don’t know,”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong didn’t have an answer either, so he could only make an assumption. “Maybe he can’t do it, or maybe he’s trying to be nice?”</p><p>Trying to be nice… Ye Xiaotian was dumbfounded when he heard the words.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
