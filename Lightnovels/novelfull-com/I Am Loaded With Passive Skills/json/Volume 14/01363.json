Then, I can only use you to test the waters first…”</p><p>In the Disappearing State, Xu Xiaoshou looked at Teng Shanhai, who was being beaten up by the Void Attendant, and his heart tightened. He was also certain of his previous deduction.</p><p>The Void Attendant used the aura of the Spiritual Herbs and Holy Medicine in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer to determine who the Herb thief was!</p><p>Just now, for the sake of the experiment, he had endured the pain and pulled out a Holy Medicine and three grade one Spiritual Herbs. He then made them into a paste and applied it on Teng Shanhai.</p><p>If the Void Attendant had already known who the real thief was, it would not have attacked Teng Shanhai. Instead, it would have released the person in front of it and searched for him instead.</p><p>But he did not.</p><p>“In that case, whoever I want to kill next, I’ll just smear the medicine directly on his body. The Void Attendant will attack wherever the scent is!”</p><p>“It’s a pity though…”</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou thought about the price of this approach, which was the Spiritual Herbs and Holy Medicine, he felt a bit pained.</p><p>“One thousand damages to the enemy, eight hundred damages to one’s self!”</p><p>In the distance, Teng Shanhai was still being beaten up.</p><p>Even though the Power of the Demon God in one of his arms had been unsealed, he was still like a toy in the hands of the Void Attendant. Other than being passively beaten up, he did not put up any resistance.</p><p>Teng Shanhai could have made a counterattack.</p><p>However, the body of a Void Attendant was too hard and could absorb energy attacks.</p><p>The power of his Holy Blood was instantly devoured by the Void Attendant’s body, and the remaining power was like an itch through a boot. It was powerless to resist the Void Attendant’s smooth left and right hand attacks.</p><p>This action was not only meaningless, but on the contrary, it stimulated the dark giant even more and made it more brutal.</p><p>“It must really hurt…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart palpitated with fear as he watched. However, his sharp eyes discovered that no matter how powerful the Void Attendant’s attacks were, Teng Shanhai, who appeared to be in such a sorry state, had not died.</p><p>His Cang God Armor only caved in slightly from the high-frequency attacks. There weren’t even any cracks.</p><p>Although blood seeped out from the cracks of the armor, most of the Void Attendant’s attacks were absorbed by the Cang God Armor. One could imagine that Teng Shanhai currently did not have the strength to resist.</p><p>But the Void Attendant didn’t seem to be able to kill him?</p><p>“Was the Cang God Armor that tough?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned. He vaguely remembered that the Double Dumba*s, who were also at the Higher Void State, could not even withstand a kick from the Void Attendant and their bodies disintegrated on the spot.</p><p>And the full set of Cang God Armor’s attributes, in theory, should only be able to withstand attacks at the Higher Void level, right?</p><p>This meant that although the Void Attendant looked strong, its attack power was still not at the level of a Demi-Saint.</p><p>Or could it be that Teng Shanhai’s Cang God Armor was so special that it could even block the attacks of a Demi-Saint?</p><p>“No matter what, I don’t think Teng Shanhai will die in a short time. If we attack from a distance, how long will it take for the Void Attendant to kill Teng Shanhai’s true body in the Cang God Armor?”</p><p>Xu Xaoshou gritted his teeth and decided to add another strong dose of medicine to this bloody scene!</p><p>With a swish, he drew another Portrait Clone and threw it out regardless how reluctant the Clone’s expression was.</p><p>Of course, he used the face of the Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi.</p><p>“Teng Shanhai, we agreed to split the Spiritual Herbs in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer at a 60: 40 ratio. I cooperated with you on account of your status as the head of a Combat Division in the Holy Divine Palace and also accorded the same level of respect.”</p><p>“Look at you now.”</p><p>“This is the consequence of disobedience to a Saint!”</p><p>‘Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi’ entered into the game. The moment he appeared, he crossed his arms and stared at the bloody mess that was Teng Shanhai. He then mocked him. “Beg me for help. As long as you beg me, a Saint, this Saint can help you overcome this tribulation.”</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The Void Attendant immediately stopped his attack and grabbed Teng Shanhai with his left hand, not willing to let him go.</p><p>Then, he turned and glared at the human who was also covered in Holy Power.</p><p>“When did the Holy Power become so abundant?”</p><p>This thought flashed through the Void Attendant’s mind before he was attracted by the aura of Spiritual Herbs on this person.</p><p>It quickly recognized the face!</p><p>Just now, it was this person who had a confrontation with the human in his hand; they had a discussion.</p><p>“Did he mean that the two humans had a disagreement over the distribution of the Spiritual Herbs in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer? Was that why he used him as a weapon to deal with the other party?”</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>At the thought of this, the Void Attendant’s eyes turned red again.</p><p>“Damn it, it was indeed these hateful humans who emptied the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.”</p><p>It turned out that they weren’t alone.</p><p>it turned out that they were a gang!</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Teng Shanhai, who was in the Void Attendant’s hand and who had been beaten to a daze, couldn’t hear anything clearly. Through his swollen eye, he could vaguely tell that the other party was an enemy.</p><p>However, he could only follow the Void Attendant and roar in a low voice like a beast, unable to speak a single human word.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>The Void Attendant would not wait. It grabbed Teng Shanhai and with a mighty Foot Stomp, intended to crush the other human.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou’s Portrait Clone did not cost a penny.</p><p>The Void Attendant’s feet were so huge that he did not even have the desire to dodge. He manipulated the Portrait Clone and it disintegrated into Spiritual Energy and then threw out another ‘Jiang Buyi’ from the other side.</p><p>The furious ‘Jiang Buyi’ raised his eyebrows and spoke coldly. The surrounding world seemed to be affected as well and turned icy cold. Even the ground began to frost over.</p><p>“Little Void Attendant, do you know what you are doing?”</p><p>“This Saint here lent you the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer to protect your image. Do you know my name? How dare you attack me?”</p><p>“Roar…” the Void Attendant did not care what the human’s name was. Angrily, it threw Teng Shanhai at the Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi, who had appeared in another direction.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
