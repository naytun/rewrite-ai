Boom!”</p><p>The stone giants’ feet came down from the sky one after another.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong and Ye Xiaotian dodged again. One used spatial teleportation, the other did a Space-Time Transition, and both flashed to a temporarily safe place.</p><p>“Huff huff…”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was already panting uncontrollably.</p><p>He hadn’t used the first level of Fantasy Sword Technique at such a high frequency for many years. Moreover, he didn’t use it for fighting. Instead, he used it to escape.</p><p>How shameful!</p><p>He had tarnished all of his teacher’s reputations!</p><p>If he had known earlier, he would have changed his own appearance before meeting Ye Xiaotian!</p><p>“Can you do it? It’s been so long and you still haven’t found him?” Looking at Ye Xiaotian’s calm and composed demeanor, Xiao Kongtong could not help but feel envious and angry.</p><p>Does this peeping demon have any skills? After running for so long and peeking through the spatial mirror time and time again, he still couldn’t find the person.</p><p>“You’ve asked this question no less than eight hundred times!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian had never been a good-tempered person to begin with, and after being questioned repeatedly, he could no longer contain his anger.</p><p>“I’m still thinking of ways to find them, what about you? What have you done?”</p><p>“You were the one who lured the stone giants here. Xu Xiaoshou has already left Tiansang Spirit Palace and joined the Saint Servant.”</p><p>“Instead of relying on me to find him, why don’t you have any means to locate him?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong choked and then flew into a rage, “So what if you’re the one finding the location? What’s wrong with tiring a space attribute like you a little? I’ve already given you my demi-saint person in exchange for helping me find someone, and you’re still not happy?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was speechless.</p><p>Did he agree to take the demi-saint person?</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was clearly forcing it on him!</p><p>“Then I’ll return it to you!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian took out the crystal and smacked it onto the person in front of him. “I’m done. You’re a pile of sh*t, go search it up yourself!”</p><p>Then, a Spatial Upanishad appeared under his feet and he was about to disappear.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong held the crystal in a daze for a moment. His drowsy eyes narrowed, and tens of thousands of golden swords of light came pressing down from the sky.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>The space was frozen.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s knees buckled and he almost fell to the ground. He hurriedly dodged and retreated.</p><p>He squinted his eyes and said with a heavy voice, “What’s wrong? You still want to attack me?”</p><p>With the crystal in his hand, Xiao Kongtong strode toward Ye Xiaotian with a solemn expression. Just as the latter’s guard was at its maximum…</p><p>He reached out and gave Ye Xiaotian the crystal back.</p><p>“Eh?” Ye Xiaotian was a little taken aback by his action.</p><p>“There’s no reason for me to take back the things I’ve given out.” Smiling awkwardly, his tone was neither salty nor light.</p><p>“You’re crazy!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian almost cursed out loud.</p><p>However, the ability of the person in front of him was undoubtedly one of the best swordsmen he had ever seen.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong used ‘Space-Time Transition’ continuously to escape, and ‘Absolute Imperial Control’ to stabilize the space. He had clearly been in an extremely bad state after running for his life and although only two of his nine great sword arts were revealed, Ye Xiaotian could tell that all of them were at the first realm!</p><p>Was he scary?</p><p>He was terrifying!</p><p>“What do you want?” Ye Xiaotian couldn’t figure out this guy’s plan. He didn’t even care about the demi-saint person? Was he acting?</p><p>“I didn’t expect you to disregard the demi-saint person, ” Xiao Kongtong said with a long sigh. At this moment, his thoughts were exactly the same as Ye Xiaotian’s. “This is the real ‘Foundational roots of Saint Ascension’. It’s just a problem that would lead to 300 to 400 stone giants. As a spiritual cultivator, I’ll risk my life to protect it.”</p><p>“Heh, I’m afraid I’ll have the life to take it, but not the life to enjoy it.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian sneered. He was one of the Four Disciples of the Holy Palace. Why would he care about this?</p><p>“Strictly speaking, the only one who betrayed the Holy Palace was the Saint Servant, Sleeveless. I only left the mountain to travel in search of someone, and on the surface, I’m still a member of the Holy Palace.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian paused for a moment and clasped his hands behind his back. “Even if I really betrayed the Holy Palace, as long as the Spatial Upanishad of the higher void state returns to four-hill mountain, do you think four-hill mountain will not take me in? ”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong thought, quietly, “You really have a big family and business!”</p><p>As expected, one still had to rely on their background to make a living.</p><p>“But the demi-saint person is always scarce, isn’t it?” Xiao Kongtong didn’t want to dwell on this and returned to the main topic, asking seriously, “I just want to know, where is Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s brows furrowed for a moment before relaxing, and he remained silent for a long while.</p><p>“You already know the answer, yet you didn’t want to leave.”</p><p>“Ye Xiaotian, I didn’t know you were so cold-blooded!” Xiao Kongtong sneered.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian let out a heavy sigh and kept all the spatial mirrors. “I’ve looked over almost the entirety of Forest of Miracles. Xu Xiaoshou isn’t here.”</p><p>“He’s here!” Xiao Qianqian was absolutely certain that the sword cognition he had left on Xu Xiaoshou had appeared in the vicinity of the Forest of Miracles not long ago.</p><p>“That’s right. That’s where the problem lies. That’s the only place I don’t dare to look at,” Ye Xiaotian said as he turned around and looked into the distance.</p><p>That direction was where the Holy Power fluctuations had repeatedly erupted when he had been fleeing under the feet of the stone giants.</p><p>“Twins…demi-saint?” Xiao Kongtong’s face darkened. “As I expected, this is the only place left… ”</p><p>This time, the two of them were chased by the stone giants and were running around in circles in the Forest of Miracles. However, they deliberately avoided the place where the demi-saint’s pressure erupted.</p><p>He never thought that after so many twists and turns, the final destination was really that place!</p><p>“I only have one good friend, Elder Sang. Xu Xiaoshou can only be considered a junior. The only connection to our relationship is Sang Qiye…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
