There were wood shavings everywhere, and deep pits could be seen.</p><p>It had already been a day since the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer had been emptied, but the Void Attendant was still on a rampage!</p><p>However, those who could come to the Abyss Island were all smart people. Who would not have noticed such a huge super giant going crazy?</p><p>All of the Spiritual Cultivators in the area used their protective techniques to hide as they did not want to to be targeted by the crazy giant.</p><p>However, they didn’t know why the Void Attendant had gone crazy. They only thought that an unusual phenomenon had occurred, accompanied by the birth of a precious treasure.</p><p>As such, they continued to hide and risked the danger of being targeted by the Void Attendant, while they also desperately searched for treasures in this ancient messy forest.</p><p>Unfortunately…</p><p>Except for the deep pits, each pit bigger than the previous ones, the largest of which was thousands of miles in size.</p><p>The so-called ‘treasure’ was something that no one could find.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>With another heavy stomp, the Void Attendant killed another Higher Void State Spirit Cultivator.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>This was only the third human Spiritual Cultivator it had found in a day!</p><p>It had clearly seen more than these number of people when it soared into the air earlier.</p><p>However, when it saw those people, they also saw it. Before he landed, they had all disappeared.</p><p>Those who hid well were still alive.</p><p>Those who didn’t hide well would be dismembered, which was the outcome of trespassing!</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The enraged Void Attendant couldn’t even smell the slightest whiff of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer’s Spiritual Medicine on the three dead human Spiritual Cultivators.</p><p>This also meant that the three humans who had died were not the ones who had stolen the Medicine. They were purely innocent scapegoats.</p><p>And that ‘thief’ was still at large!</p><p>“Er…er…er…er…er…”</p><p>The Void Attendant, who had been blinded by rage, stomped on the corpse again, and it was reduced to nothing. However, a low, strange sound came from the side of his foot.</p><p>The Void Attendant was furious.</p><p>He leaned over and saw that it was a small stone!</p><p>The strange cry of ‘Er…er…’ seemed to be a sort of mockery, for being brainless; for having been lured away from the mountain which caused it to lose its home.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The Void Attendant growled, as he stood there with his hands on his waist. He kicked out, trying to crush the noisy rock.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>In the next second, the Void Attendant, who had kicked with all his might, could not even move the small stone in the slightest. However, the sole of his foot was torn apart by a blunt weapon through the gap between his toes, and black blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>The Void Attendant fell to the ground in pain. He clutched the wound on his foot and hissed like a pug. At this moment, his anger was overridden by the pain.</p><p>“What, what happened?”</p><p>The Void Attendant was stunned.</p><p>“How many years had it been since it got hurt? How could it have kicked a stone and crippled its own foot?”</p><p>It should be known that this was a body that could even swallow Holy Power, and that thing was only a trivial stone…</p><p>“Er…er…er…er…er…”</p><p>The little stone continued to emit its noise.</p><p>Due to his height, the Void Attendant was unable to identify the origin of this item.</p><p>Now that it had squatted down and covered its foot with its hand, the Void Attendant was shocked.</p><p>“This, this is…”</p><p>“Void Suppression Stele?”</p><p>The thing that made the ‘er…er…’ sound was the Void Suppression Stele that an Abyss Island Sinner had carried before!</p><p>“Huh…”</p><p>The Void Attendant shouted out in anger and the red light in its eyes faded for a moment.</p><p>Why would the Void Suppression Stele be here?</p><p>Was it because his destructive actions had angered the spirit of the Abyss Island, and it now wanted to punish him?</p><p>“Er…er…er…er…er…”</p><p>The Void Attendant suddenly panicked when he heard the ‘Er…er…er…’ sound.</p><p>Perhaps this was not a noise, but a warning from the spirit of the Abyss Island, as if it had predicted that the Herb Garden of the Divine Farmer it protected would be stolen.</p><p>And now, the ‘cautioning’ had changed to ‘warning’ :</p><p>“If you dare to destroy the Forest of Miracles again, you will die!”</p><p>The Void Attendant felt as if this was a warning meant for him.</p><p>“Roarrrr!”</p><p>It clutched its leg and retreated in a hurry and respectfully indicated to the Void Suppression Stele that it had no intention of destroying it, but had been blinded by anger.</p><p>“Er…er…er…er…er…”</p><p>The Void Suppression Stele continued to make strange sounds.</p><p>Spiritual objects that could give clear guidance in the past now expressed their thoughts ambiguously.</p><p>The Void Attendant didn’t understand, but it was afraid.</p><p>“I, will only kill one person, the one who stole the Medicine!”</p><p>It raised its hand and promised. Then, it no longer dared to be presumptuous, nor did it dare to vent its anger on the innocent Forest of Miracles. It retreated in fear.</p><p>“Void Suppression Stele”</p><p>Thinking of the Void Suppression Stele, the Void Attendant thought of the Abyss Island Sinner who would carry out the mission.</p><p>To be honest, the Abyss Island Sinners in the past were all proud and arrogant. They believed that no one would die as long as they did not break the rules of the Abyss Island. After getting used to life on the island, they did not care about the Void Attendants at all.</p><p>Therefore, serial number 800820 was one of the few Sinners it had seen who would cooperate and carry out the mission.</p><p>Furthermore, that human had even managed to obtain the approval of the Void Suppression Stele and became a giant.</p><p>This was not simple.</p><p>He could be considered half a Clansman.</p><p>The Void Attendant suddenly yearned for the opportunity to find that serial number 800820 again and issue a mission to use humans to defeat humans.</p><p>Thinking about it, that medicine thief would surely die without a burial place, right?</p><p>…</p><p>“Achoo!”</p><p>“Bang bang, bang bang, bang Bang Bang Bang!”</p><p>Just as he opened the pathway to the Yuan Mansion, he was struck by a sudden sneeze. His heartbeat accelerated, his eyelids twitched, and even the rate of the Holy Emperor Dragon Scales became extremely fast.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
