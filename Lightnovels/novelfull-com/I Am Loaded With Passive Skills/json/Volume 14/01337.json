There were no springs installed, so how could this be?</p><p>It was too terrifying.</p><p>This poison was too terrifying.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit had never seen a human who could beat its master so miserably.</p><p>Perhaps people couldn’t do it, but medicine could!</p><p>“Meow, meow, meow~”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit was anxious.</p><p>It was worried, but it couldn’t enter the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>After thinking about it, the only person who could save its master was the mistress.</p><p>Thus, Greedy the Cat Spirit looked for a while more before running quickly into the broken tower. He bit the clothes of the mistress and pulled her out, signaling for her to come out and save its master.</p><p>Human lives were at stake!</p><p>Lei Xi’er returned to the herb garden and looked at Xu Xiaoshou, who managed to get himself into such a situation. She fell silent for a while.</p><p>When she was reflecting on her mistakes in the broken tower, he was enjoying himself here?</p><p>(Cursed. Passive points +1, +1,+1,+1 )</p><p>“Don’t worry about him. He’s a happy person. He is able to fly due to taking some medicine. You’ll get used to it.”</p><p>After carrying Greedy the Cat Spirit away, Lei Xi’er no longer looked at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>She had already known about this.</p><p>Even if it was the first time she had seen such an exaggerated ‘back and forth bounce’, with Mu Zixi’s memories, Lei Xi’er knew that Xu Xiaoshou was someone who would often do this.</p><p>It was not uncommon at the Spirit Palace!</p><p>“What a freak.”</p><p>With a red face, she snorted and turned to leave.</p><p>However the next second, she stopped. She took out the image recording bead and aimed it at the scene of Xu Xiaoshou happily bouncing. She squatted down happily and recorded it.</p><p>“Hehe, for the 1321st time, I have successfully recorded it!”</p><p>“Tsk, tsk, this time you’re really perverted. Oh, Xu Xiaoshou, Xu Xiaoshou, when you become famous, I’ll be the only one who knows all of your dark past.”</p><p>“When the time comes, I’ll collect these image-recording beads one by one and call Zhou Tianshen and Xin Gugu to come over to watch.”</p><p>With a swoosh.</p><p>After recording for less than three breaths, Lei Xi’er suddenly sobered up. She stood up in disbelief and gave herself a hard slap.</p><p>What was she doing!</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s face turned red.</p><p>It was fine that Xu Xiaoshou was doing such a shameful thing, but she was also recording such a shameful thing. This action itself was even more shameful!</p><p>Moreover, Xu Xiaoshou’s current state…</p><p>Just by looking at it, she already felt that it was abnormal, so how could she record it?</p><p>“Puff…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er let out a heavy breath and forced herself to calm down. She was about to leave.</p><p>But then she looked around and saw the dense fog around her.</p><p>It was obvious that Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t notice any outsiders, and there was no one else in the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>“There’s no one else other than me. It’s not too much to record this, right?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er couldn’t believe that without the interference of another consciousness, she would have such an absurd thought.</p><p>She rubbed her burning face and thought about it. The Holy Miracle Fruit had become dull.</p><p>In the end, she finally followed her inner thoughts, squatted down, and placed the image-recording bead back in its original position.</p><p>“Meow~”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit called out curiously, not understanding what was going on.</p><p>“Don’t say anything!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s delicate body trembled. She was clearly shocked. She patted her chest and turned around to find that it was a cat. She thought for a moment and reached out to cover the eyes of Greedy.</p><p>“Child, don’t look.”</p><p>“You’ll be silenced.”</p><p>…</p><p>“The sky is so blue…”</p><p>“The clouds are so white…”</p><p>“The breeze is so warm…”</p><p>Under the effects of the Dragon Apricot, the corpse-like Xu Xiaoshou was paralyzed in the deep pit. His whole body was powerlessly stuck to the ground, not daring to move.</p><p>He looked at the sky and continued to be in this state of emptiness. It had already been more than half a day.</p><p>In fact, he had completely absorbed the medicinal power of the Holy Miracle Fruit in less than 15 minutes.</p><p>However, he had yet to recover from the aftereffects of absorbing the fruit using the breathing technique.</p><p>“It’s been so long, it should be about time?”</p><p>He tried to move his fingers again, but this one move moved his entire body. The touch of his fingertips made his forearm tremble. Then, his body moved, and he once again came into intimate contact with the ground.</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes rolled back, and white foam frothed at his mouth.</p><p>(Stimulated. Passive points +1)</p><p>Two streams of tears flowed down.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Why is it that I’ve only swallowed one Holy Miracle Fruit of Herb Garden Divine Farmer and I’m already suffering from such a severe side effect?”</p><p>“How long will it take for me to eat until it ends?”</p><p>He had originally wanted to eat the Holy Miracle Fruit and the 99 Dragon apricots to try out the effects of the ‘power of the Dragon ancestor’.</p><p>He didn’t expect that</p><p>One Holy Miracle Fruit was a sure kill!</p><p>Xu xiaoshou, who was in saint mode, could only sob.</p><p>“Sob sob!”</p><p>Thud.</p><p>A fragrant wind came from his side, and suddenly, a black figure appeared in his vision. Then, with her silver hair, Lei Xi’er, who was dressed in black, looked down and smiled. “Xu Xiaoshou, you still haven’t recovered?”</p><p>“Still…ah…”</p><p>As soon as he opened his mouth, Xu xiaoshou began to foam again. He could only send a message helplessly through telepathic communication, “There’s still another wave…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er smiled.</p><p>What kind of physique was this?</p><p>Why did Xu Xiaoshou become so cute after taking drugs?</p><p>She crossed her arms and squatted down, looking at the extremely weak face with a smile. Suddenly, a cunning look flashed in her eyes. She reached out and gently poked Xu Xiaoshou’s cheek.</p><p>“Urgh urgh.”</p><p>Sure enough, Xu Xiaoshou made another groan.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
