There wasn’t even the sound of birds chirping. It was very depressing.</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>Suddenly, there was a sound from afar.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou and Lei Xi’er squatted on the ancient tree and looked over curiously in that direction.</p><p>“It’s a little far. It shouldn’t affect us.”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou said that, he felt that the explosions in that direction were even louder than those created by the Void Attendant.</p><p>“Which explosion spirit was this?”</p><p>“After all, we’ve been on the Abyss Island for so long. It’s normal for each of us to make some noise at the landing point.”</p><p>As Lei Xi’er said that, she looked at the Barrier-like sealing array in front of them and said in a low voice, “Xu Xiaoshou, how long do we have to wait?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around and looked at the Barrier in front of him as well.</p><p>He inhaled the rich medicinal fragrance and felt the fluctuations of his Energy Reserve as well as his body, which was so comfortable that it trembled a little. He shook his head and said, “I don’t know, but we have to wait.”</p><p>The actors were not in position yet, so he could not be overly anxious.</p><p>In fact, Xu Xiaoshou could have used the Imitator to turn into Double Dumba*s and split his body to infiltrate the sealed Barrier.</p><p>However, the scene from the Soul Reading earlier was that as long as someone moved the Spiritual Medicine in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, the Void Attendant would definitely wake up.</p><p>The real Double Dumba*s only had the time to pluck one Holy Miracle Fruit before they were madly pursued. In the end, they were given a mission by the Void Attendant and died under his hands.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou dared to guarantee that even if he went in to pluck the actual fruit, he would at most pluck a few more.</p><p>And after being alerted of the enemy’s move, the Void Attendant would definitely not allow him to successfully plunder the Spiritual Medicine again.</p><p>If that was the case, wouldn’t that piece of Herb Garden of Divine Farmer that was enough to drive a person crazy go to waste?</p><p>“Why don’t we give up?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er immediately suggested. When she thought of the 3000 feet tall Void Attendant, her heart felt extremely stifled.</p><p>A Sovereign Stage and a Master Stage actually attempted to obtain the entire Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that the person squatting in front of them was Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>If it was someone else, Lei Xi’er would have left long ago. This was simply unrealistic!</p><p>“It’s impossible to give up. We’re already here…”</p><p>After Xu Xiaoshou said this, he suddenly stopped. He turned his head to the side and said, “They’re here!”</p><p>“Someone’s here?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er looked over warily. With a spin of her God Devil Eyes, she could clearly see the person coming from afar.</p><p>It was a shirtless man with a dense aura. His cultivation level was extraordinary and he was at the Higher Void level.</p><p>“Who is that?”</p><p>“I don’t recognize him…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head, but he vaguely felt that the person looked familiar.</p><p>He thought for a moment and then recalled that he had indeed seen this person on the Lone Cliff. He had always stood behind Rao Yaoyao and Teng Shanhai.</p><p>There were more than ten Higher Void level people with him.</p><p>“Someone from the Holy Divine Palace?”</p><p>It didn’t matter who the person was.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou only needed to know that this person wasn’t a friend, and then he could go ahead and scam him.</p><p>It was all for the Foundational Roots of Saint Ascension. I won’t let you get scammed for nothing. As long as you have the ability, you can also have a share of the pie of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>“However, how much ability you will be dependent on your own methods.”</p><p>“If you can’t handle my setup and became a pawn that was used as cannon fodder, then it’s your own fault. You can’t blame anyone else.”</p><p>“Hide well. I’ll give you Greedy the Cat Spirit. I’ll be right back.”</p><p>Holding the Imitator, Xu Xiaoshou transformed into Double Dumba*s and jumped down from the tree.</p><p>…</p><p>Dragon Fighter, Hong Dang, had been searching the entire way.</p><p>He had come here in pursuit of the increasingly fragrant smell of medicine.</p><p>Originally, he had come to the Abyss Island at the Ancient City’s Construction Zone. However, just like Xu, he heard the sound of explosions in the outskirts and made his way over.</p><p>Hong Dang didn’t know where this ancient forest was.</p><p>However, along the way, the increasingly rich aroma of the Spiritual Ingredients lingered around his nose, which told him that this was a Treasure land!</p><p>Walking out of the narrow path, the huge footprints on the ground also came to an end.</p><p>Hong Dang raised his eyes and saw the boundless, borderless, super-large sealed Barrier.</p><p>“The aroma of the Spiritual Medicine came from here?”</p><p>Hong Dang seemed to have realized something. He was immediately on his guard against any possible dangers around him as he approached the Barrier.</p><p>“Crack.”</p><p>At this moment, from behind the ancient tree at the side, a faint sound of a dead branch being trodden on could be heard.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Hong Dang shouted. His Spiritual Source turned into a golden Barrier that enveloped him totally. Then, he turned his eyes and stared at the source of the sound.</p><p>“…”</p><p>No one responded.</p><p>Hong Dang narrowed his eyes. His right palm turned into a fist and struck across the air.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The ancient tree exploded into dust, but there was still no one behind it.</p><p>“I’m here.”</p><p>At the same time, a hoarse voice appeared behind his head.</p><p>Hong Dang suddenly turned around. Without any further ado, with a loud bang, the Phantom of a Golden Dragon wrapped around his body. Then, he lashed out with a whip kick.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The space was smashed into pieces by this whip kick.</p><p>The black hole only took a second to take shape. Within the next second, the space was restored.</p><p>The rules of the Abyss Island were even more powerful than those of the Shengshen continent.</p><p>“Tsk tsk, you’re really vigilant, my friend.” Mocking laughter came from another ancient tree behind them.</p><p>Hong Dang looked over and finally saw the actual person.</p><p>It was a person who was completely wrapped in a black robe and even had a mask on his face. He did not reveal his true appearance to anyone.</p><p>“Who are you and why were you so sneaky?”</p><p>Hong Dang shouted coldly. At first glance, he could not discern the other party’s cultivation level, but the person who appeared was so elusive, and he was also on the Abyss Island.</p><p>Probably the Cutting Path Stage could rival the Higher Void level .</p><p>There was a 99% chance that it was a Higher Void level who was on the same level as himself.</p><p>The unknown was always terrifying. However, when the black-robed man finally revealed himself, Hong Dang let down his guard a little. This was because from the other party’s words, it seemed that he had no ill intentions?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
