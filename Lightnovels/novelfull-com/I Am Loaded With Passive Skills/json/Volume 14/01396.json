But, at this moment, it seemed that he and the weapon were so close, yet worlds apart!</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>“Spatial attribute? The time attribute?”</p><p>“You’re just an ancient swordsman; how can you grasp so many things simultaneously? You’re not Bazhun’an…that’s impossible!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi went crazy. Endless Holy Power burst out of his body, forming a barrier.</p><p>However, the barrier also moved away from him in the next second. It was like a merciful Bodhisattva trying to protect the entire Abyss Island from the harm of this sword.</p><p>But a hundred ghosts were right in front of them!</p><p>It’s them!</p><p>These ghostly beings!</p><p>They had all passed through!</p><p>“Time, space, leap, warp…”</p><p>At the last moment, even Jiang Buyi understood what kind of sword art the Mei Siren had used to end their lives.</p><p>His so-called first stage of the Space-Time Transition Fantasy Sword Technique was used as a support, sending everything he had laid down to him.</p><p>The sword light enlarged in his eyes.</p><p>The ghostly being sublimated in an instant.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi felt he was floating and had entered a beautiful state.</p><p>He was completely naked as he charged into another space-time. In this space-time, the tower of the lost saint, the divine demon piece, and the nine great soul defence holy weapons had all disappeared.</p><p>Whereas some are…</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>The malicious ghost suddenly appeared and wailed.</p><p>Jiang Buyi suddenly sobered up.</p><p>It turned out that he had not drifted into another time and space. Instead, the sword of Mei Siren had sent all his soul-protecting holy weapons into another time and space.</p><p>Then, without holding anything back, he poured all his spiritual attacks onto his physical body, which had even been stripped of the ‘defence’ of his clothes.</p><p>Absolute spiritual attack versus a defenceless demi-saint.</p><p>Outside the battle.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong immediately stood up, and Ye Xiaotian smacked his head.</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou, who had disappeared, could not help but hold his jaw in shock. He was amazed by this beautiful and Godhood Space-Time Transition!</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Without any suspense, the enormous floating sword conjured by the Swordless Sword Technique was the first to blast Jiang Buyi’s physical body out of the various great soul-protecting holy weapons across parallel space-time to the back of his holy weapon.</p><p>And…</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The nine sword cries indicated that the Nine Sword Techniques had ended the formation of the gate of earth’s prison. It pierced through the air in anger and nailed into the forehead, throat, chest, shoulders, palms, and feet of Jiang Buyi’s demi-saint true body!</p><p>With a loud “Chi!” sound, his skin split open.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was firmly locked in the air. Only his eyes were left to welcome the arrival of the hundred ghosts.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>The Ten Kings of Yama followed closely behind the sword. They knocked Jiang Buyi’s soul out of his body with a bang.</p><p>The thick, strong, and extraordinary demi-saint soul body was like a fish on a chopping board in front of the ferocious ghost king, who was dozens of feet tall.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>An arm and a foot were pulled, the head was twisted, and the waist broken.</p><p>In a flash of light, Jiang Buyi’s soul body, behind his physical body, disintegrated in the sky!</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>The little ghosts pad by and the night crows gnawed at the soul.</p><p>the bloody scene was too horrible to look at.</p><p>“Hiss, hiss, hiss, hiss…”</p><p>The painful voice of the soul reverberated in the Nine Heavens.</p><p>Not long after, heaven and earth finally returned to silence, and the Forest of Miracles stopped operating.</p><p>Three spectators were outside the battle, and they all felt their blood run cold.</p><p>“Sigh…”</p><p>Looking at the bleak scene in front of him, Mei Siren closed his eyes silently. Then, he released the sword and sighed, “I’ve said that this sword can hurt a demi-Saint, and may even kill him. “</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
