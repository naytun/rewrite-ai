He chuckled and said,</p><p>“The Spatial Upanishad has reached perfection. I’m sure the next step will be the Saint Ascension.”</p><p>“As a thank you for cultivating Xu Xiaoshou, I’ll give you a treasure. It is a small gift but my affection is sincere. I hope you won’t reject it.”</p><p>As he spoke, he took out the crystal gemstone. Under Ye Xiaotian’s stunned gaze, he said calmly, “This is a Semi-Saint Person which I’m giving to you. May you become a Saint soon.”</p><p>Thud…</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, he smacked the hot potato into Ye Xiaotian’s hands with a smile, without giving him a chance to refuse.</p><p>He was not Double Dumba*s, nor was he Hong Dang, he was someone who found it difficult to let go.</p><p>For this thing, the 300 to 400 stone giants had crossed hundreds of thousands of miles from the Sleeping Valley and chased him till the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>The Abyss Island was only that big.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was tired of running and didn’t want to run anymore.</p><p>The main reason was that the ‘Space Time Transition’ was used by others as a trump card to kill, but he used it as a method of escape. Not only was it ridiculous, but it also consumed too much energy. He was almost at his limit.</p><p>However, to casually throw away a Semi-Saint Person.</p><p>That was impossible!</p><p>The Semi-Saint Person was not a worn shoe, and it really couldn’t be abandoned on the street.</p><p>So if he found someone who could run better than him, someone who could be considered as a partial companion, he would naturally be able to give this thing away.</p><p>He also believed that Ye Xiaotian would agree with his idea.</p><p>After obtaining the Semi-Saint Person, even though the other party realised that it was a hot potato, they wouldn’t throw it away. Instead, they would run around wildly with the treasure.</p><p>That was because they really couldn’t just throw it out!</p><p>As for whose hands it would end up and whether Ye Xiaotian would be able to escape and enjoy his Semi-Saint Person status…</p><p>It didn’t matter.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong had no interest tp pursue the matter further.</p><p>He only knew that if he didn’t get rid of this Semi-Saint Person, he would die on this Abyss Island!</p><p>“As a Teacher, I should not lack such things. What I’ve lost now will be returned in another way in the future. That’s all.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian, who had just received the crystal gemstone, was speechless.</p><p>“What did you say? This is a Semi-Saint Person?”</p><p>He was really frightened.</p><p>This thing…</p><p>“Am I dreaming?”</p><p>“So, what’s the situation now? My life was filled with misfortune, and I’ve finally received a gift from the Heavens. I don’t have to cultivate hard anymore?”</p><p>“Ye Xiaotian, take care.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong reluctantly looked at the crystal gemstone again, then patted the Demon God’s great spear and left, in an extremely heartless manner.</p><p>It was done.</p><p>He still had one Demon God’s great spear which had yet to be given away.</p><p>“As long as I find someone to face the fire, I can move from the front to the backstage. This is ‘Bazhun’an’s style!”</p><p>When Xiao Kongtong thought of this, he suddenly felt like he had become a child who scattered treasures.</p><p>Other people would risk their lives to hide the opportunities they obtained on the Abyss Island, but he risked his life to give them away.</p><p>However, the problem was that if he didn’t give them away, he would die!</p><p>As he watched Bazhun’an leave in a hurry, Ye Xiaotian once again began to wonder if he had been daydreaming.</p><p>“How did this day turn out to be so mysterious?”</p><p>He patted his face and forced himself to calm down. Then, he carefully examined the crystal gemstone in his hand.</p><p>“Holy Power Core.”</p><p>“It’s the same as the ‘Semi-Saint Person’ that I came into contact with in the Holy Palace, and it doesn’t seem to be fake.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was dumbfounded.</p><p>He was both ecstatic and afraid.</p><p>A ‘stranger’ who wasn’t even a friend had just gifted such a treasure to him with no strings attached after meeting him in the First Hall of Sins?</p><p>This Semi-Saint Person wasn’t like an apple!</p><p>Ye Xiaotian pinched his thigh hard as he held the crystal gemstone in his hand.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>“It hurts! I’m not dreaming!”</p><p>All his doubts finally turned into joy, with the knowledge that he had really been hit by a pie from the sky.</p><p>The joy only lasted for a second.</p><p>“Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom!”</p><p>Suddenly, the sky in the distance shattered, and countless huge stone feet stepped out of the space. Then, out came 300 to 400 stone Giants, which were several times taller than the Void Attendants in the First Hall of Sins, and landed at the entrance of the hall.</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian looked up, and with a shake of his hand, the Semi-Saint Person fell to the ground.</p><p>He looked at the crazy scene in front of him and felt that his world had turned dark. Suddenly, his entire body twitched crazily, and he was so angry that his white hair stood on end.</p><p>“Bazhun’an, you jerk, take this broken toy back!”</p><p>“Take it back!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
