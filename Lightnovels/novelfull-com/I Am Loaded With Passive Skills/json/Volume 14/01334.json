Although he was seriously injured, he had successfully escaped!</p><p>He didn’t think much of it in the past.</p><p>Looking at it now, this battle prowess was simply ridiculous to the extreme!</p><p>There were no ordinary people in the higher void level, and the white-clothed cultivators of the Holy Divine Palace were the elites of the elites. Furthermore, there were also the Divine Puppets, who were said to be able to rival all existences in the higher void level and could temporarily fight against demi-saints!</p><p>In the face of all this, Cen Qiaofu resisted.</p><p>Other than the fact that his own combat strength was indeed outrageous, it was only because he had the support of the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch.</p><p>A tiny branch from the blood tree, one of the Nine Great Ancestral Trees, could bring about such a terrifying increase in combat strength.</p><p>Wouldn’t the Dragon Apricot of the Dragon Apricot tree be equivalent to converting this increase in combat strength into an increase in cultivation energy?</p><p>“One Dragon Apricot should be equivalent to the increase in combat power of one Blood Tree’s Yin Branch, right? It should be the permanent kind.”</p><p>“If that’s the case, how much of an improvement can all the Dragon Apricots here bring me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought about this as he touched the Dragon Apricot tree with a trembling hand. At the same time, he saw the hundreds of Dragon Apricots on the tree crown.</p><p>Ah.</p><p>Was this the fragrance of a Sovereign realm?</p><p>Damn it, why did it smell so good?</p><p>“…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er looked at Xu Xiaoshou’s intoxicated posture and suddenly felt that it was absurd.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never been so obsessed with her.</p><p>Yet in front of a tree, this guy seemed to have just seen a real treasure.</p><p>How funny!</p><p>“That’s because you’re too bad. If it were me, Xu Xiaoshou would be happier than seeing the Dragon Apricot!” In her mind, the voice of a cute little loli suddenly flashed.</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s delicate body stiffened, and she hurriedly looked at Xu Xiaoshou. She found that this guy was still immersed in the fragrance of the Dragon apricot and did not hear this sound, and immediately relaxed.</p><p>“Little lass, it’s time to sleep. If you say a few more words, you might faint again.” She laughed in her mind.</p><p>“Thief!” In the dark space of consciousness, a little loli in a green dress and two ponytails put her hands on her hips and said angrily, “You took over my body while I was asleep, you thief! Now that I’m awake, give me back my body!”</p><p>“…” Lei Xi ‘er’s vision turned black. She helplessly held her forehead. “You played by yourself until you fainted. If I didn’t come out to take over, this body would have died long ago. Are you blaming me?”</p><p>“I don’t care, you’re a thief!”</p><p>“It’s time to sleep, little sister~”</p><p>“Hmph, you better pray that you don’t get hurt, or I’ll come out!”</p><p>“That’s impossible.”</p><p>“I’m hungry, you better take in a few more breaths of vitality spiritual energy!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er laughed and conjured her figure in the space of consciousness. She looked down from above, bent over, and said with a smile, “Do you think I’ll fall for it?”</p><p>“Ahh!” The loli screamed, “When did I ever become your little sister? Shut up! Quickly go and eat the Holy Medicine! Even if you eat all the Holy Medicine in this herb garden, Xu Xiaoshou won’t blame you!”</p><p>“Oh?” Lei Xi’er pinched her chin, her beautiful eyes narrowed, and said playfully, “This is also your body. Do you still want to become smaller?”</p><p>“Uh!” The little loli was suppressed. She held her head and looked at her curvaceous body in front of her, which was outlined by the black dress. She only felt a suffocating feeling.</p><p>“I just couldn’t control my mouth in the past. Now that you’re whining, then, then eat half? Just half will do!”</p><p>“Not a single one. I won’t be fooled.”</p><p>“Hey! Damn it, damn it, hurry up and eat. If you don’t eat, I’ll make noise in your mind. Anyway, this is how you used to make noise in my mind! Vixen!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was dumbfounded.</p><p>Vixen?</p><p>Why was she scolding herself?</p><p>Also…Lei Xi’er didn’t disturb her before. After the little loli woke up, she only gave her a few reminders when she was in danger. She treated the loli with much respect.</p><p>Now that she had woken up, she had said more than what Lei Xi’er had ever said.</p><p>Yet she still wanted to argue?</p><p>“You should sleep.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er didn’t want to argue anymore and left the space of consciousness.</p><p>“Ahh!”</p><p>In the darkness, there was only a little loli with two ponytails left. She was kicking her feet on the ground in the dark space. “Damn it, damn it, damn it…Xu Xiaoshou, my Xu Xiaoshou… Sob sob, quickly return my Xu Xiaoshou… Xu Xiaoshou, hurry up, hit her!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was speechless.</p><p>So noisy!</p><p>She didn’t have to care about her image just because Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t see, right?</p><p>Lei Xi’er felt embarrassed for her!</p><p>Lei Xi ‘er tried her best to get rid of the noise in her mind. She glanced at Xu Xiaoshou, who was still immersed in the Dragon Apricot and decided to leave quickly.</p><p>Before, she thought that staying by Xu Xiaoshou’s side might be a good choice. However, now, she felt that this plan might not work.</p><p>As long as she saw Xu Xiaoshou, her other self would go crazy!</p><p>She glanced at the Holy Miracle Fruit and was about to put it down when her mind exploded. She cried out strangely. Lei Xi’er’s beautiful eyes widened, and she took a deep breath. She gritted her teeth and said, “Fine! I’ll eat it!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
