(1)</p><p>“Beep beep beep…”</p><p>Five hundred miles away, an old man, who had changed into a light purple swordsman’s robe, was holding a paper fan in one hand and a talisman in the other, staring into the distance.</p><p>Demi-saint Jiang Buyi tore apart the chief of the combat division, Teng Shanhai.</p><p>The direction that the spiritual talisman was guiding him to was the center of the battlefield!</p><p>What the hell had happened there?</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>In his memory, Si River…</p><p>“Bazhun’an, are you sure you’re right? Where there’s an explosion, there’s Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“But the explosions caused by Xu Xiaoshou are usually very huge. How am I supposed to accurately find him in the middle of the explosions?”</p><p>“Use this. This is a ‘communication talisman’. I’ve made a trip to the Inner Island of Abyss Island and placed the will of the Holy Emperor on this talisman. Even if Xu Xiaoshou uses his ‘Vanishing Technique’, you can still find him.”</p><p>“How big is the area?”</p><p>“I don’t know, but the one in your hand is a secondary ‘communication talisman’. The range of communication is very small, and it is usually used for passive communication.”</p><p>“So you’re saying that I can only find him if he contacts me? You’re just looking for a helper for him!”</p><p>“Uh, Senior, you are twisting my words. It’s not like… I suppose you can understand it this way too? Ahem, actually, Senior, the talisman in your hand also has a certain active communication function, but the range is a little small.”</p><p>“You’ve said this before, but how small is the range?”</p><p>“Yes, I’ve said it before. I don’t know. After all, I have never used it before. Senior, why don’t you try it yourself when you are at Abyss Island?”</p><p>At this moment, Mei Siren’s face was filled with bewilderment, just like that day by the Si River, when Bazhun’an had given him this “communication talisman”.</p><p>It was obvious that Bazhun’an wanted to turn him into Xu Xiaoshou’s henchman.</p><p>However, Mei Siren did not care about these things.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, a junior who was at the master stage of spiritual cultivation and sovereign stage in the Way of the Sword…</p><p>What kind of trouble could he cause?</p><p>At most, the night battle in the imperial city would be his highlight. He had provoked Rao Yaoyao, but there were also other Saint Servants who came out to clean up his mess.</p><p>Mei Siren did not care about these things at all. As long as it was not a demi-saint, he was not afraid of anyone in the world.</p><p>He felt that no matter how demonic and reckless Xu Xiaoshou was, it was extremely difficult for a higher void, or even the higher-ups of the Holy Divine Palace, to meet a demi-saint.</p><p>How was it possible that Xu Xiaoshou would meet one by chance, provoke the other party, fight with him, and just happen to be nearby? At the same time, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t use the help of other Saint Servants but took the initiative to use the “communication talisman” to ask him for help.</p><p>Was this a joke?</p><p>In this world, it would be impossible for so many coincidental contracts to come together!</p><p>Now, however…</p><p>“Beep beep beep…”</p><p>The communication talisman vibrated slightly, and so did Mei Siren’s fingers.</p><p>He raised his head, lowered his head, raised his head again, and lowered his head, again and again, to confirm the direction pointed by the communication talisman. It was indeed the battlefield where a demi-saint had torn a higher void apart.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you must be really sick in the head, right?”</p><p>This time, even Mei Siren could not help but curse.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had really offended a demi-saint, and he still wanted to ask him for help?</p><p>Moreover now, although he had disappeared, there was no doubt that he was trapped in the demi-saint’s holy realm!</p><p>Mei Siren immediately understood Xu Xiaoshou’s predicament.</p><p>However, if he was to fight a demi-saint now and go to the holy realm to fish for Xu Xiaoshou… Didn’t he see that the demi-saint had gone crazy? He dared to tear apart a combat division’s head right under Rao Yaoyao’s nose. Wouldn’t it be suicide for anyone to enter the realm now?</p><p>“I’m not a demi-saint yet. I’m just a small higher void.”</p><p>Mei Siren took a deep breath, hid the communication talisman in his hand, and wanted to turn around and leave.</p><p>However, after all, he had promised Bazhun’an. One could not go back on his word. Mei Siren raised his foot, but in the end, he could only sigh and turn around. He waved his paper fan anxiously.</p><p>This paper fan was brand new, obviously newly made. The front side was sternly written with the words “You’re worthy of being taught” in thick ink, and the back side was written with the words “Are you stupid?”.</p><p>Only the heavens knew how excited Mei Siren was when he received Xu Xiaoshou’s first call after being bored on Abyss Island for so long.</p><p>He had even taken out the paper fan he had made on the way here.</p><p>From the words on the fan, it was not difficult to see that Mei Siren had already prepared a teaching plan in great detail during this period of boredom.</p><p>He even made up his mind that perhaps Xu Xiaoshou would only be able to see the words “You’re worthy of being taught” once throughout his apprenticeship. The rest would all be “Are you stupid?” as he knocked on his head.</p><p>Everything was ready except for the student.</p><p>However, this student had given him a huge gift even before he had acknowledged him as his discipline.</p><p>“Teacher, can you help me kill a demi-saint? You’re a Seven Sword Deity!”</p><p>Mei Siren took a few deep breaths.</p><p>Once again, he adjusted his breathing. He felt that as a teacher, tolerance and magnanimity were indispensable qualities and should not accommodate the students.</p><p>He could only blame Xu Xiaoshou for having such shocking “talent”!</p><p>“Mm, Rao Yaoyao is also there. I can’t go over now. Otherwise, I’ll only intensify the conflict or make them point their fingers at us…” Mei Siren pondered.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou also hid very well. If not for the communication talisman, I would not have been able to find him.” Mei Siren nodded as he continued to talk to himself.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
