You’ve been hiding among the people on the Lone Cliff.</p><p>“If I was not wrong, the Void Gate under the Deep Sea was also the work of all you Saint Servants, right?”</p><p>From Bazhun’an to the scroll containing the Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict, everyone knew he was the one who had planned the overall situation on the Abyss Island.</p><p>Teng Shanhai stated an undeniable fact. Thus, he was not afraid of being questioned by the other party.</p><p>“Hahahahaha!”</p><p>When he heard this, Xu Xiaoshou laughed so hard that he bent over like a shrimp and his tears almost spilled over.</p><p>“Teng Shanhai, Oh Teng Shanhai, are you really stupid or are you just pretending to be stupid?”</p><p>“Did you still think that it was Yama Huang Quan who made fun of you all on the Lone Cliff?”</p><p>What did that mean?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what are you talking about?” Teng Shanhai was stunned.</p><p>“I’ll tell you!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wiped the tears from the corners of his eyes. He was finally certain that Xiao Divine Spear was just a convenient move by Teng Shanhai and not a backup plan.</p><p>“I said, if the Xiao Divine Spear was really taken by Huang Quan, how can I, Xu Xiaoshou, take it back from him?! He laughed.</p><p>There was an explosion in the void.</p><p>The Yuan Mansion could no longer contain the Godhood spear of the Inscription Stele.</p><p>The black-red evil Godhood spear, which was as thick as a rock and over ten feet long, pierced through the air and steadily landed on Teng Shanhai’s palm.</p><p>The body of the spear was dark and gloomy. As soon as Teng Shanhai held it in his hand, the brutal aura from the spear instantly filled Teng Shanhai’s entire body, which complemented the Cang God Armor.</p><p>At this moment, Teng Shanhai seemed to have reverted to his complete form. He had the aura of an overlord, that of one man who guarded the pass against ten thousand!</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou was even more disdainful.</p><p>If it wasn’t his, then there was no need to snatch it.</p><p>He wasn’t really greedy by nature. It was just that if the other party couldn’t guard the treasure, he was willing to help the other party guard it.</p><p>If you are one with the weapon, like the Famed Sword and the Sword-bearer, then they are yours. I will return them to you.</p><p>It was like taking the Famed Sword at the Green Scale Ridge, and still being chased by the night watchmen.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou no longer held Teng Shanhai back. Just like how he had abandoned his sword in the White Cave, he released Teng Shanhai and allowed him to obtain his birth weapon.</p><p>“With that brain of yours, so what if I give you the Xiao Divine Spear, can you turn the world upside down?”</p><p>Teng Shanhai clenched the Xiao Divine Spear tightly. His heart surged with emotions and he was extremely excited.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou’s last words still lingered in his ears like a demon’s whisper.</p><p>“What did this guy mean?”</p><p>The fact that he was able to take back the Xiao Divine Spear only proved that the Saint Servant and Huang Quan were in cahoots, which was why he could get back Huang Quan’s items, right?</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>“Wait a minute!”</p><p>At a certain moment, Teng Shanhai finally felt that he had discovered a blind spot. His single eye instantly widened as he said with a shocked expression, “Xu Xiaoshou, you mean the Huang Quan at the Lone Cliff was not the real Yama Huang Quan, but…”</p><p>“It was me, Teng baby!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clapped his hands gleefully and smiled like a sunflower. He also said in disbelief,</p><p>“No way? So you only realized it now. Are you trying to say that even Rao Yaoyao couldn’t see through my disguise after the battle at the Lone Cliff and is still in the dark?”</p><p>“Or perhaps, she, Rao Yaoyao did react, but did not dare to tell you for fear she would be mocked?”</p><p>“Or could it be the last possibility, which means that you, Teng Shanhai, have long been abandoned by Rao Yaoyao and aren’t part of her intelligence team?”</p><p>“Oh, that’s right, you and your brain.”</p><p>In the end, Teng Shanhai no longer heard what Xu Xiaoshou said.</p><p>As soon as he heard the first part of the sentence, he felt a loud bang. It was as if a lightning bolt had struck his mind, and he was so shocked that his entire body was charred and numb.</p><p>“Impossible…Impossible…” Teng Shanhai muttered subconsciously.</p><p>“How was this possible?”</p><p>“If the Huang Quan on the Lone Cliff was indeed Xu Xiaoshou in disguise, why would the two who held vigil, each with Lei Family’s Eyes and actual members of Yama, cooperate with him?”</p><p>“If what Xu Xiaoshou said was true, Rao Yaoyao and I actually found his real body on the Lone Cliff that day?”</p><p>However, after Xu Xiaoshou’s transformation, he felt that it was not enough to humiliate everyone and he transformed into Huang Quan and trampled on everyone’s intelligence again.</p><p>“You are so full of shit!”</p><p>Teng Shanhai flew into a rage. He hit the ground hard with his Xiao Divine Spear, which caused the earth to shatter into pieces.</p><p>At this moment, even the Bounded Domain began to tremble and become unstable.</p><p>Teng Shanhai would never, ever, ever believe it!</p><p>The Huang Quan on the Lone Cliff was actually Xu Xiaoshou’s transformation!</p><p>At that time, Huang Quan was like a lofty tower, who looked down on all directions, swallowed mountains and rivers, and could even resist the sun and moon. He even dared to use the secret vigil to make a face-to-face deal with Rao Yaoyao in an attempt to get its hands on the Diagram of the Five Great Divine Instruments of Chaos and also the Cang Godhood Sword.</p><p>The audacity of the guy!</p><p>That kind of aura!</p><p>That kind of calmness in the face of danger, the ability to summon clouds and rain with a flip of his hand, was something that only a Master Stage could pull off?</p><p>“Are you kidding me?”</p><p>“Aargh…”</p><p>Teng Shanhai’s eyes blazed in anger. He panted heavily through his nose, as if two hot streams of air were flowing out. He really didn’t want to believe these facts.</p><p>However, when he saw Xu Xiaoshou in convulsions, he felt that he had been completely played from the inside out.</p><p>Only now, through the mouth of the person involved, did he realize how stupid he was that day.</p><p>“I, I think I understand a little, now.”</p><p>Suddenly, Teng Shanhai’s eyes went blank and lost its focus. He thought of the moment at the Deep Sea, before everyone was sucked into the Abyss Island in front of the Void Gate.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
