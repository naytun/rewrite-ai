Instead, he would seriously talk to her about “leaving” and “staying.”</p><p>“Revenge…”</p><p>In the past, Lei Xi’er felt that there was no need to involve Xu Xiaoshou in the revenge of the Lei family.</p><p>After all, Xu Xiaoshou was too weak. He was still far from growing up.</p><p>Furthermore, she, after awakening, had the inheritance of the Lei family, and her growth speed was far beyond Xu Xiaoshou’s.</p><p>After all, she was already a sovereign, while Xu Xiaoshou was only at the master stage.</p><p>However…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s master stage was no weaker than her, a Sovereign. In fact, it was even more terrifying than an ordinary higher void!</p><p>Using the inheritance of the Lei family’s memory as a comparison, Xu Xiaoshou’s growth rate was probably not inferior to the “Three breaths for innate stage, three years for Sword Deity” of Bazhun’an.</p><p>In fact, it was even better than that!</p><p>Perhaps he could really help her…</p><p>But!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, do you know how big the Lei family’s enmity is?” Lei Xi’er thought about it and sighed softly.</p><p>“I know!” Xu Xiaoshou said without hesitation.</p><p>The Holy Divine Palace?</p><p>The Five Holy Emperor Aristocratic Families?</p><p>Weren’t they who he had been fighting against right now?</p><p>Even if he was just a chess piece, he would still exert 120% of his power.</p><p>Now that he had this Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, he was not far from becoming a chess player!</p><p>“You’ve emptied a Herb Garden of Divine Farmer. A void attendant can kill you.” Lei Xi’er’s tone was heavy, “And the Abyss Island is a prison used by the Holy Divine Palace to imprison demi-saints and Holy Emperors.</p><p>She didn’t say it clearly.</p><p>However, in such an obvious contrast…</p><p>One could only imagine how great the gap between the two sides was.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t discouraged. He smiled and said, “The situation is like this now, but not in the future.”</p><p>“I’m alone…” Lei Xi’er fell silent as she spoke.</p><p>“That’s why you need me even more!”</p><p>“But on the other side, it’s almost an entire world.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at her and calmly shook his head. “Wrong is wrong. Even if you’re alone, I’ll stand in front of you and fight against the entire world who are in the wrong.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s lips curled up when she heard this.</p><p>These words sounded like a child in a fit of pique, but Xu Xiaoshou could say them so righteously.</p><p>“Just for me?” She smiled faintly, “I’m no longer your Little Junior Sister.”</p><p>“You may not be anymore, but I will always be your eldest senior brother.” Xu xiaoshou was extremely solemn.</p><p>Looking at Lei Xi’er’s smiling expression, she was about to speak when Xu Xiaoshou quickly added, “Elder Sang is still in the Dead Sea of Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe. Do you really want to sever your master-disciple relationship with him?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er kept quiet.</p><p>These words caught her off guard, and she was unable to refute them for a moment.</p><p>However, it was because of Xu Xiaoshou’s sincerity that she felt that she could no longer maintain her independence as “Mu Zixi” and “Lei Xi’er” in front of this person.</p><p>Under the Dragon Apricot, Lei Xi-er suddenly felt happy.</p><p>She stopped talking about the serious matter and looked at Xu xiaoshou with a frivolous smile. She suddenly asked, “So, you relocated this Herb Garden of Divine Farmer for me?”</p><p>(Teased, Passive Points, +1)</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou choked for a moment and realized that this wasn’t a “tease”. The passive system was toying with him!</p><p>However, he glanced at the herb garden and thought about this question. He reluctantly replied, “Half, half? I can’t give it all to you, I still need to use some holy medicines to upgrade.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was speechless.</p><p>(Cursed, Passive Points +1, +1,+1,+1)</p><p>She looked at Xu Xiaoshou and was completely speechless.</p><p>At the same time, in her mind, she was responding to another consciousness that had woken up and was forcing her to ask this question.</p><p>“Mu Zixi, Mu Zixi, this idiot was really not worthy of your love!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
