In the end, he could only use it to escape and failed.</p><p>This sounded very normal. After all, the moment the Double Dumba*s appeared, he was already in a weakened state.</p><p>However, the only abnormal point was that the one who beat up the weakened higher void was a junior at the master stage.</p><p>“How strong are you now?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er raised her eyebrows and asked hesitantly.</p><p>She immediately recalled Xu Xiaoshou who was almost as tall as the sky just now. Under the enhancement of ice and fire power, he was like a god.</p><p>Was that really Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had always been by her side. When did he grow to this level?</p><p>Even if Double Dumba*s was not in a weak state, perhaps Xu Xiaoshou in that state would still have the strength to fight with him.</p><p>The key was…</p><p>Lei Xi’er remembered that Xu Xiaoshou still had the posture of a devil giant.</p><p>It was the final move that fused the demonic aura of Fourth Sword into his body and turned him into an evil giant.</p><p>In other words, when dealing with Double Dumba*s, the grandmaster realm Xu Xiaoshou hadn’t used his full strength yet…</p><p>“Criticized, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Criticized, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“I don’t know how strong I am now…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou scratched his head, feeling a little embarrassed.</p><p>To be honest, the strategy of using “Transformation” to transform his body into a giant and activating the Berserk Giant to increase his size, strength, and endurance for the Infernal Original Seed was something he thought of on the spot.</p><p>He was very strong!</p><p>However, before this, in the Yunlun mountain range, Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to use it because he was constantly being watched. Naturally, he did not even think about it.</p><p>Every time he fought, he would either pick up the scraps or use a trick to reduce a higher void’s combat strength by half before fighting…</p><p>Anyway, Xu Xiaoshou recalled that he did not seem to have fought against a higher void when they were at their peak, so it was naturally difficult for him to assess his current combat strength.</p><p>“HMM?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er wrinkled her nose, and her eyes revealed her dissatisfaction with this answer.</p><p>To be honest, she had always thought of Xu Xiaoshou as a ruler in her heart, used to measure herself, and as an object to surpass.</p><p>This was an obsession that belonged to Mu Zixi’s time.</p><p>Lei Xi’er originally thought that after her cultivation level broke through to the Sovereign realm, with the God Devil Eyes, she could beat Xu Xiaoshou up.</p><p>Now, however, it seemed like…</p><p>In front of Xu Xiaoshou, she could only be a supporting character. She was still lacking a little bit in a head-on battle.</p><p>“I really don’t know!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou spread out his hands. He couldn’t possibly find a higher void in their peak condition to fight against just to verify the answer.</p><p>A normal master stage wouldn’t have such thoughts.</p><p>However, in a life-and-death battle, one should be able to calculate the right time, place, and person to their advantage. The use of schemes and luck could also be counted as part of one’s own strength.</p><p>Thinking of this…</p><p>“It’s probably because I don’t want to fight against a higher void. However, if I really fight to the death, I should be able to kill and cripple a higher void’s combat strength.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought for a moment and then added seriously, “But the one who can’t die should only be me in the end.”</p><p>“‘Ascending to the Heavens in A Single Step’ and Vanishing Technique… I still have so much holy blood and the will of demi-saint and Holy Emperor to protect my body.”.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t believe that other than Sword Deity like Rao Yaoyao, there were many higher voids in the world that he couldn’t overcome.</p><p>Of course, this involved a lot of external forces and resources.</p><p>In addition, some strange cutting paths and higher voids, such as Huang Quan with time and space attributes, weren’t in Xu Xiaoshou’s consideration.</p><p>“…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was silent again when she heard this answer.</p><p>She regretted asking this question. As expected, she would only be given a hard time.</p><p>This was because she was not completely confident that she could fight against a higher void.</p><p>Even though the Double Dumba*s from before was weak, Lei Xi’er did not have much confidence that she could kill or keep the other party alive.</p><p>On the other hand, Xu Xiaoshou…had more than enough confidence!</p><p>“Cursed, passive points + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>“Heh.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the information bar and smiled.</p><p>“My target is the spirit division chief, Yu Lingdi. I heard that when this guy was a Sovereign, he could already kill a higher void by himself.”</p><p>“I reckon that even when Double Dumba*s was at his peak, he could easily be taken down by Yu Lingdi when he was at the Sovereign level.”</p><p>“If I still don’t increase my combat strength, I’m afraid that when I see this guy in the future, I won’t even be able to run away.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er nodded silently.</p><p>This made sense.</p><p>However, very quickly, she reacted to something and raised her eyes in astonishment.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Yu Lingdi was already a Sovereign!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was only a grandmaster now, and he was still at the first stage, Heavenly Image State!</p><p>How could he compare himself to someone like Yu Lingdi?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou naturally understood this girl’s thoughts. The corners of his lips lifted and he said, “Time is the same for everyone.”</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>At this moment, the battle ended. The void attendant who was watching from behind stepped forward.</p><p>“Congratulations, mission accomplished.”</p><p>He waved his hand and two golden lights descended.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly caught them and discovered that they were two fist-sized black hexagonal crystals. The pure energy contained within them was extremely majestic.</p><p>Just by holding them like this, his breathing technique unconsciously inhaled a mouthful.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
