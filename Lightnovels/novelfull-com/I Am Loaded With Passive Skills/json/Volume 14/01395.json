It should be easy to tell who should be easy on who, right?</p><p>Was Mei Siren seriously just a higher void-level cultivator and Sword Deity?</p><p>“Let’s wait and see.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong didn’t want to talk anymore.</p><p>“Even if he decides to go easy on the demi-saint, with the perfect combination of the three major realms of Ancient Sword Technique and the support of the sword image, not every demi-saint could take his strike.”</p><p>…</p><p>With the colorful immortal clouds as his main body, the demi-saint was still in shock.</p><p>In the battle, Jiang Buyi was already confused.</p><p>At this moment, as the only target, he knew that he was in trouble.</p><p>Who would have thought that a Sword Deity, who was below the demi-saint realm, would be so powerful after using the sword image?</p><p>“It’s just a sword strike?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi was frustrated.</p><p>With a slash of the sword and the enhancement of the sword image, the three major realms were manifested.</p><p>He had risen from the higher void level to a position that was enough to defeat the Saints!</p><p>Jiang Buyi finally understood what Mei Siren had said.</p><p>That man hadn’t just boasted!</p><p>“The sword can hurt or kill a demi-saint, but I don’t know what will happen.”</p><p>Mei Siren had made it clear that he wasn’t sure about the outcome, for he had never launched an attack with this technique. Besides, he hadn’t said so to threaten Jiang Buyi!</p><p>“Lunatic!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi cursed angrily.</p><p>He wasn’t an expert in the spiritual aspect.</p><p>His only hope was the Demi-Siaint Stage spiritual defense treasure might be helpful now.</p><p>However, it might not be enough…</p><p>He was dealing with a sword technique that was almost able to kill a Saint, so what could he get after surviving?</p><p>Jiang Buyi regretted it, for he realized that he should have left immediately. Moreover, his reputation didn’t seem that important at this moment. It would not be worth it if his spirit was hurt in this battle!</p><p>However, he couldn’t have reversed the time.</p><p>With Yama in the lead, hundreds of ghosts crossed the border and charged toward Jiang Buyi like hungry beasts. He had already sensed that he was their target now.</p><p>He had no choice but to take this attack head-on!</p><p>He was the one choosing to stay because of his ego, so he had to bite the bullet and hang in there!</p><p>“Don’t give up!”</p><p>“Jiang Buyi, you are a demi-saint!”</p><p>He had been one of the most arrogant men in the world, but the sword image had shattered his self-confidence.</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Buyi did not realize that he was afraid of a swordsman below the demi-saint level.</p><p>Normally, he would have tried his best to wipe away this traumatic feeling as soon as possible.</p><p>However, he was in danger, so he could not care so much.</p><p>“Soul-losing Saint Tower!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi had never used a weapon since the beginning. He felt that it would be very degrading to use a weapon against these losers, but the first holy weapon he summoned today was a defensive one.</p><p>He raised his hands.</p><p>A dark blue Holy Light descended from the sky.</p><p>This was a holy tower of the soul attribute, combining both attack and defense. It was translucent and mysterious, and it enveloped Jiang Buyi right after descending.</p><p>The ten meters tall tower was nine meters thick and could give anyone a sense of security spiritually.</p><p>However, as soon as the holy tower fell, Jiang Buyi clearly sensed that something was wrong.</p><p>An instinct told him that perhaps this holy tower alone might not be able to withstand Mei Siren’s supreme spiritual attack.</p><p>“Divine Demon Piece!”</p><p>Through the translucent spiritual holy tower, everyone could see that Jiang Buyi had summoned another ancient bronze tablet from his body in a hurry.</p><p>At first, this ancient piece was only the size of a palm. However, after being poured with holy essence, it grew to the height of a person, began spinning rapidly, and floated in front of him.</p><p>A trace of power beyond the demi-saint realm emerged.</p><p>“Mei Siren!” Jiang Buyi suddenly roared.</p><p>Even the Divine Demon Piece actively protected him, which was something he had not expected.</p><p>This treasure was from the Lei family’s treasury and had the ability to resist the attacks of a Holy Emperor. With the supreme treasure, he had nothing to fear anymore.</p><p>Divine Demon Piece could take physical, elemental, spiritual, and spiritual attacks!</p><p>Jiang Buyi had found something to hold onto in his panic, and he was no longer afraid of any attacks from the ancient swordsman!</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi shouted coldly, “I am standing right here! I’ll take a step back to show you…”</p><p>Before he could finish his words, the calm voice that sounded like the death god mumbling suddenly appeared in his ears again.</p><p>“The sword technique has a name…”</p><p>Jiang Buyi instantly had a mental breakdown. At this moment, a cold wind penetrated from his toes to his head.</p><p>These were the three major realms of the Nine Swords Technique!</p><p>What was Mei Siren doing?</p><p>What else did he want?</p><p>Codger, piss off!</p><p>Jiang Buyi did not know what other moves an ancient swordsman like Mei Siren would make.</p><p>In his fear, he could only follow his spiritual sense. He suddenly waved his hand and tossed out the nine major spiritual defensive holy weapons stored in his spirit.</p><p>They were a bell, cauldron, shield, bead, talisman, blood, dragon soul, crystal armor, and an eyeball.</p><p>These nine holy weapons were tightly sealed within the tower, wrapped around Jiang Buyi, and formed an absolute spiritual defense.</p><p>However, no matter how strong it was, when hundreds of ghosts pressed down, Mei Siren’s calm voice still pierced into the eardrums, sending a chill down Jiang Buyi’s spine.</p><p>“The sword technique has a name, and it’s called illusion. The Dao of illusion…”</p><p>“Magnificence and magnificence, the kingdom of Godhood in the heavens, vast and boundless, eternal and undying.”</p><p>“Nothing is true, and nothing is false. Everything is just an illusion…”</p><p>The Taoist music was pounding everyone’s eardrums.</p><p>In a second, Jiang Buyi’s mind went blank.</p><p>“This is impossible!” he roared in shock and anger.</p><p>However, before the Taoist music went silent, Jiang Buyi saw in horror that Spirit Eliminating Tower that protected him seemed to have become illusory as a hundred ghosts directly penetrated it!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
