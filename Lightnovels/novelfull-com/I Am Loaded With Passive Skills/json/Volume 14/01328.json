He kept piecing it back together with the rest of his bloody and fuzzy body.</p><p>“Thirty feet!”</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>“Double Dumba*s… You damn animal, I had no enmity with you in the past, how could you trick me like this!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Another kick came, and Hong Dang exploded and splattered like mud.</p><p>The Void Attendant crossed his arms and looked on mockingly as the ball beneath him exploded and healed, time and again.</p><p>It had witnessed the greed of humans.</p><p>If he had released the Holy Miracle Fruit, he would have survived and would not have been hunted down.</p><p>However, no matter who it was, the first thing they would do after getting the Fruit was to eat it!</p><p>The Void Attendant looked at the scene below him and felt that it was absurd.</p><p>“Was his life more important, or was the opportunity more important?”</p><p>“The so-called opportunities, weren’t they all for the sake of one’s life? Weren’t they all chosen for the sake of having a better life?”</p><p>Eat the Holy Medicine and the prize is a tragic death…</p><p>Wasn’t this the complete opposite of the goal of these people before they stole the Medicine?</p><p>“Sometimes, I really don’t understand humans.”</p><p>The Void Attendant kicked the ball repeatedly, trying to kill it.</p><p>It liked this kind of fun activity after countless years of peace.</p><p>Of course, it would be even better if an Abyss Islander Sinner came back at this time.</p><p>They would issue missions, watch the humans fight, and finally be rewarded with a few stones. They would be respected and feared.</p><p>The humans were utterly defeated!</p><p>“But, why does this person keep saying ‘Double Dumba*s’?”</p><p>The Void Attendant stomped on the ground again, his big head looking a little puzzled.</p><p>It had just fallen asleep not long before it was awakened by the disturbance. It felt that it shouldn’t have been another thousand years or ten thousand years already, right? Therefore, he could still vaguely remember that ‘Double Dumba*s’ was the name of the guy who was killed by serial number 800820.</p><p>“He’s already dead. Does this human hate a dead person?”</p><p>“Perhaps it’s because of old grudges that were formed outside the Abyss Island.”</p><p>The Void Attendant didn’t think much about it.</p><p>As soon as it wanted to issue a mission, it naturally remembered the little Giant with the serial number 800820.</p><p>“I miss it.”</p><p>“If that sinner turned into a little Giant again and came over to accept the mission to kill this human, how interesting would that be?”</p><p>Unfortunately, as he had said before, he would never see him again.</p><p>This was because after witnessing his Combat Strength, no human would covet even a weed in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer that was under his protection!</p><p>“I’m done. Since there are no other sinners from the Abyss Island, I’ll calm down and go back to sleep.”</p><p>With that thought in mind, the Void Attendant no longer kicked the invader under its feet like a ball. Instead, it reached out and grabbed the human who was still desperately trying to repair its broken body.</p><p>“Ahhh…”</p><p>Hong Dang was still roaring in fury.</p><p>He hated it!</p><p>He hated the Double Dumba*s, hated the Void Attendant and hated this ruthless world even more!</p><p>“You are so noisy.”</p><p>The Void Attendant’s crimson eyes moved closer as it buzzed and spoke. Its thunderous voice almost shattered Hong Dang’s eardrums.</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>Hong Dang was stunned.</p><p>“You can talk?”</p><p>“You can communicate?”</p><p>His eyes suddenly widened as he thought of how he had almost squeezed out his lifespan in order to escape. He was only hanging on by a thread through the medicinal power of the Holy Miracle Fruit.</p><p>And now, the Void Attendant had just told him.</p><p>It turned out that both parties could communicate.</p><p>“Then, what’s the point of me running?”</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Hong Dang wanted to cover his head, but his hands were tightly bound. He could only roar helplessly.</p><p>“If I knew you could talk, I would have told you the truth, how could you chase me?”</p><p>“Human, you are the noisiest human I have ever come across.”</p><p>It was rare for the Void Attendant to speak so much, because it had never seen such a noisy fellow before. Had this person cultivated all his life and only cultivated the shouting Skill?</p><p>“Idiot! You idiot!”</p><p>“How can you only speak to me now?”</p><p>Hong Dang shook his head as tears of blood flowed down his face.</p><p>He was no match for the Void Attendant, but now that he was so close to death, he was willing to mock the Giant even at the cost of his death.</p><p>“Heh, so!”</p><p>Hong Dang spat at the Void Attendant’s crimson eyes and laughed hysterically.</p><p>“Hahahaha…”</p><p>“You idiot, you’re really stupid!”</p><p>“You brat with well-developed limbs but a simple mind, do you know that you shouldn’t have chased me? You’ve fallen into the trap of the Double Dumba*s. Your house has been stolen!”</p><p>The Void Attendant was furious.</p><p>He didn’t expect this human to humiliate him with such a powerless physical attack before he died.</p><p>“Die,” he said.</p><p>His right hand wrapped around Hong Dang’s body, and his left hand reached out and directly pinched the human’s head.</p><p>“Kill me, kill me, hahahahahaha!”</p><p>“Kill me!”</p><p>“You… Hong Dang’s eyes were about to pop out. However, your Herb Garden of Divine Farmer has vanished, if nothing unexpected happened!”</p><p>The Void Attendant would never have believed the words of these humans, but at this time, it suddenly had a bad feeling.</p><p>“Luring the tiger away from the mountain?”</p><p>“His home was stolen?”</p><p>The Void Attendant didn’t quite understand what this meant.</p><p>However, the phrase ‘The Herb Garden of Divine Farmer has vanished’ was very straightforward, and this he understood.</p><p>“You, what are you talking about?” The Void Attendant asked.</p><p>“Hehehahahaha!” Hong Dang laughed evilly, not wanting to explain any further.</p><p>He was at the end of his life and couldn’t live anymore, so he finally used all his strength to roar, “I said, you’re an idiot! An idiot with a rotten brain in the Herb Garden! You’re unparalleled… Absolute trash!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
