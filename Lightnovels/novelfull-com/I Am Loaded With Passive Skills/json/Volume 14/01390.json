Finally, his curiosity made him ask, “It’s already so chaotic, and you have seen what’s happening… So, how much do you still have?”</p><p>After being stunned for a moment, Xiao Kongtong put on a bright smile.</p><p>“I told you, Ten Aura. For real, I am telling you the truth.”</p><p>After saying this, he stepped forward and no longer looked back.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian finally closed his eyes as he turned stressed.</p><p>He had already expected to feel triggered after asking the question, but he had no choice.</p><p>After seeing the monster in the distance, he felt that the amount of time he could hold on for was even longer than Teng Shanhai.</p><p>He had no Aura at all!</p><p>Xiao Kongtong still responded in such a way!</p><p>“Are you laughing for Ten Aura?” Ye Xiaotian shook his head and sighed. Suddenly, he chuckled and said, “You’re really merciless. You’ve been shattering my confidence all the time!”</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile, the Arena was broken, chaotic, and ruined.</p><p>Saint Statue and Present Gods and Buddhas were still in a standoff, and none of them had made a move. However, visible shock waves exploded in the void layer by layer, spreading thousands of miles away.</p><p>The earth was shattering, and the space crumbled. It was like the end of the world.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was still hiding.</p><p>When he realized that Jiang Buyi’s Hands of Saint Judge was a great cry and little wool and being destroyed by Master Siren’s Present Gods and Buddhas, he knew that something was wrong.</p><p>“I was too close-minded and naive. How could I think Master Siren and the demi-Saint Jiang Buyi’s battle is like the ones between those ordinary cultivators at the higher void level?”</p><p>“In this world, there are indeed ways for a higher-void cultivator to defeat a demi-saint.”</p><p>“Anyone below the demi-saint level can still fight against them without Holy Blood.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hid far away and looked at Master Siren, whose momentum had completely suppressed demi-saint Jiang Buyi after crushing the Hands of Saint Judge. At this moment, he felt that he had realized something but couldn’t tell what it was.</p><p>“Is it an illusion?”</p><p>“Master Siren’s will is too strong. He doesn’t have any Holy Power, but I feel like he can kill the demi-saint in the next second.”</p><p>“But what’s the use of strong will? We all know the truth. Jiang Buyi is a demi-saint! If he could defeat him, I could do the same as long as I hold Swallow the Mountains and Rivers a bit longer, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned, for he knew that his Swallow the Mountains and Rivers had no limit.</p><p>However, he still felt that there was a gap between the will he and Master Siren displayed.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“I think I’ve learned this before, but why can’t I remember it?”</p><p>Before he could figure out the answer, Jiang Buyi, who was in the middle of the battle, spoke, “I know what’s going on.”</p><p>After he came to a realization, he looked at the Present Gods and Buddhas behind Mei Siren, and a trace of jealousy flashed in his eyes.</p><p>“I thought Bazhun’an was the leader of Way of the Sword and was the only man to combine Spiritual Cultivation in it to be the greatest of all time.”</p><p>“Mei Siren, I didn’t expect you to be as powerful as him!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi looked at the faint light of Way of the Sword that gathered around Present Gods and Buddhas, took a deep breath, and stared at Mei Siren with jealousy.</p><p>“Your world is the reflection of your mind, and your actions embody your faith. Everything comes from your mind and imagination…”</p><p>“I didn’t expect an old man like you would say something like this, but you are right.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi raised his head to look at Mei Siren and asked, “The key that helps you fight against a demi-saint like me is your Penetrating Divine Senses, right?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
