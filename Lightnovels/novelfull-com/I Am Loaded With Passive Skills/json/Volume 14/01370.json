The fluctuation of his holy power was undoubtedly at the level of a demi-saint. His appearance, temperament, and gestures didn’t look like an impersonator.</p><p>Teng Shanhai was telling her that such a person was Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>To refer to Jiang Buyi as Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao couldn’t help but look back and berate Teng Shanhai.</p><p>Even if Jiang Buyi was indeed guilty before his crime was confirmed, he was not someone ordinary people could blaspheme.</p><p>This person was a demi-saint!</p><p>“He’s Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Seeing this, Teng Shanhai became anxious. He raised his Xiao Divine Spear high and said, “I located him through Xiao Divine Spear. This guy even admitted that he’s Xu Xiaoshou, and I recovered my Xiao Divine Spear from him!”</p><p>This?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was even more stunned.</p><p>She clearly knew that Teng Shanhai’s Xiao Divine Spear had been snatched away by Xu Xiaoshou during the night battle in the imperial city.</p><p>Now that Xiao Divine Spear had returned to Teng Shanhai’s hands, what else could be more ironclad proof than this?</p><p>Even if she didn’t believe that Xu Xiaoshou could disguise himself as a demi-saint to such an extent, Rao Yaoyao was 90% convinced.</p><p>“What do you want to say?” With Cang Godhood Sword in hand, Rao Yaoyao held it in front of her. She stared at Jiang Buyi with hostility in her eyes.</p><p>She wanted an explanation?</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Buyi only found the situation funny.</p><p>This matter was too ridiculous and comical.</p><p>It was so ridiculous that he did not know how to respond. It was so funny that it refreshed Jiang Buyi’s view of the world.</p><p>If Jiang Buyi had not recognized Rao Yaoyao and Teng Shanhai, he would have thought that the two people in front of him had been possessed by some stupid group and had become so laughable.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Jiang Buyi shook his head and muttered. He had heard of this name before.</p><p>A junior from the Saint Servant who had caused trouble in the Eastern Region, and his name had spread throughout the five regions.</p><p>As long as one had some status, it was likely that everyone in the Spiritual Cultivation world had heard of the name “Xu Xiaoshou”.</p><p>However, even though he had heard of him, Jiang Buyi felt that he had never interacted with Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He also couldn’t imagine how that Xu Xiaoshou could imitate him and pass off as the real one, to the point that even Rao Yaoyao and Teng Shanhai believed him.</p><p>It must be known that it was impossible for ordinary people to obtain information about demi-saints.</p><p>Jiang Buyi did not even have much interaction with Bazhun’an. Naturally, he did not know where Xu Xiaoshou can gather his information and start imitating him.</p><p>“If you want to condemn someone, why not?” Jiang Buyi sneered.</p><p>Throwing away the speculation that the two in front of him were actually idiots, he could only guess that Rao Yaoyao and Teng Shanhai had conspired against him just to condemn him again.</p><p>On top of the crime of “attempting to get a share of the Holy Emperor’s position” he would also be accused of “being involved with a Saint Servant”. This way, it would be easier for them to eliminate their enemy, wouldn’t it?</p><p>The only thing that Jiang Buyi did not know was why the Holy Divine Palace had suddenly targeted him. It was as if his every move was within their control.</p><p>He had not even started fighting for the Lei Family’s Eyes, but the entire world was already against him.</p><p>“You thief!”</p><p>However, as soon as he finished speaking, Teng Shanhai couldn’t help but stomp his feet. He pointed his Xiao Divine Spear at Jiang Buyi and shouted angrily, “You weren’t like this when we were fighting one-on-one earlier. Now that Sword Deity Rao is here, are you starting to shirk your identity?”</p><p>With a crack, Jiang Buyi clenched his fists and blue veins popped out on his forehead.</p><p>He had given Rao Yaoyao enough respect because of her surname, “Rao”.</p><p>However, this did not mean that he could endure Teng Shanhai’s insolence time and time again!</p><p>“I’ve been tolerating you for a long time, you know that!” Jiang Buyi’s face was cold.</p><p>Jiang Buyi swore that he had not heard such disrespectful words for many years since he became a demi-saint.</p><p>Now, however, Teng Shanhai was scolding him without any respect.</p><p>Was this the attitude that a higher void should have towards a demi-saint?</p><p>Was this how the Holy Divine Palace educate their people?</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao, control your dog. If it dares to bark again, this saint won’t spare you any respect!” In the end, Jiang Buyi held back and only stared at Rao Yaoyao as he spoke.</p><p>After all, one had to give some thought to the owner before punishing their dog.</p><p>“Hahahaha!”</p><p>At the side, Rao Yaoyao’s red lips had just opened slightly, but before she could say anything, Teng Shanhai had already burst out laughing. He stepped past her and said in a strange voice,</p><p>“Hey, hey, hey, you’re so thick-skinned! I wonder who was the one who looked like a stray dog under my spear?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, other than your Vanishing Technique and teleportation spiritual technique, do you dare to take my spear head-on?”</p><p>Teng Shanhai stood with his spear slanted. He did not underestimate the demi-saint’s pressure at all. He endured the slight trembling of his body and kept telling himself that Xu Xiaoshou was just bluffing.</p><p>“I do want you to attack me, but do you dare? Do you dare to lay a hand on me, or even get close to me?” His right arm swelled up and the surging power of Demon God pushed away the demi-saint’s pressure.</p><p>“Teng Shanhai…” Rao Yaoyao’s brows furrowed slightly. She had already felt that something was wrong.</p><p>She agreed with Teng Shanhai’s words, but the reality was that the demi-saint’s aura was too real!</p><p>Jiang Buyi was amused and furious. The sky and earth changed color. At this moment, the entire forest of miracles was gloomy beyond recognition.</p><p>This didn’t seem like something Xu Xiaoshou could do!</p><p>However, Xiao Divine Spear was taken from this Jiang Buyi. Teng Shanhai had mentioned before that his “spear positioning” technique could never go wrong.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
