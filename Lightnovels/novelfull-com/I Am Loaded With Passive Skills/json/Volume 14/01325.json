You’re always in the center of the storm, aren’t you?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian shook his head and sighed, unable to believe what he had just seen.</p><p>He quickly looked away from Xu Xiaoshou and at the Herb Garden.</p><p>Through the Spatial projection, the Spiritual Medicine in the Herb Garden looked very small, and there was no fragrance to be detected. Ye Xiaotian was unable to see clearly what sort of grade these Spiritual Medicine were.</p><p>The image of the bare-chested man holding a fruit the size of a human head and the Void Attendant chasing after him flashed through his mind. Now, he thought of Xu Xiaoshou’s wanton harvesting in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>“It can’t be?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s mouth was agape. He wanted to zoom in to see what kind of gourds were being sold in the Herb Garden.</p><p>At this time, a more terrifying rumble came from the next Spatial Mirror than from the Forest of Miracles.</p><p>“Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom!”</p><p>“Which explosive genius was this?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was dumbfounded. He immediately waved his hand, and the next scene he saw was an infinite black hole.</p><p>“What’s this?”</p><p>“Who has the ability to turn the space black on the Abyss Island? ”</p><p>All of a sudden, the screen flickered, and a large stone foot stepped out, which gave Ye Xiaotian a great shock.</p><p>In the midst of his fear, Ye Xiaotian realized that it was because the foot was too big and the impact was too strong. He had not really stepped out of the Spatial Mirror and appeared in front of him.</p><p>However…</p><p>“Why did that corner of the Great Hall that flashed by just now look so familiar? ”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s brows furrowed as he fell into deep thought, and his thoughts soon froze.</p><p>“Wait a minute!”</p><p>“The Great Hall?”</p><p>He turned his head and saw the First Hall of Sins behind him.</p><p>He turned around again and looked at the sky in the distance. It had been dyed black, just like the endless black hole in the last Spatial Mirror!</p><p>“It can’t be?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s eyes widened in shock.</p><p>Before he even had time to think, a cold glint appeared in the darkness, and then a spear shot out like a dragon.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong who was controlling the Demon God’s great spear, crashed into the main entrance of First Hall of Sins and jumped down, panting all the while.</p><p>“Someone?”</p><p>Seeing a white-haired youth who stood there transfixed, Xiao KongTong was startled. All the information about this person flashed through his mind.</p><p>Tiansang Spirit Palace’s Inner Yard’s Head, Ye Xiaotian, Space Attributes, former disciple from the Holy Palace, good friend of Second in Command Saint Servant Sleeveless. He had interacted with Teacher Bazhun’an, before losing an arm in the Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>“Ye Xiaotian?” Xiao Kongtong tidied up his clothes and asked calmly, ignoring the dark sky behind him.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was speechless.</p><p>“No, it can’t be, it’s you again!”</p><p>“You’re Bazhun’an?”</p><p>He looked at the sloppy man who had all the characteristics of Bazhun’an from head to toe, a scar on his neck and only eight fingers. However, from his disheveled appearance, he seriously doubted the authenticity of this person’s identity.</p><p>“How could Bazhun’an be in such a sorry state?”</p><p>At this thought, Ye Xiaotian nodded his head dully, but he soon broke down again.</p><p>“How could it be you again?”</p><p>He was suddenly speechless.</p><p>“Wasn’t it said that that all Spiritual Cultivators who had mastered the Upanishad skill lived good lives?”</p><p>Ever since Ye Xiaotian had acquired the Spatial Upanishad, he had yet to enjoy the same pleasure as the so-called Water-type Upanishad, Yu Lingdi.</p><p>Yet, he had tasted all the suffering that Yu Lingdi the Water-type Upanishad had never experienced before!</p><p>Before he left the sect, his arm was cut off by this guy in the Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>After completing his Final-stage Spatial Upanishad, he had been defeated in his first battle at the Yunlun Mountain Range, where he had almost been tortured to death by Huang Quan, who had the Time and Space Attributes.</p><p>Fortunately, Xu Xiaoshou appeared and saved him from his dire suffering. In the end, he turned around and entered the Abyss Island, where he was hunted down by a large group of Void Attendants in the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>“Didn’t he just escape and now he was targeted by Bazhun’an?”</p><p>“Is this what you mean by a really unlucky life?”</p><p>This was called a life full of misfortune!</p><p>“You, what’s the meaning of this?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s face darkened when he thought of all these.</p><p>He had already made up his mind not to have any interaction with these evildoers at this stage. If anything went wrong, he would directly teleport away.</p><p>“The world is so big, I still can’t find a regular Higher Void level to bully?”</p><p>“There’s not much time left, so I’ll make it short.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong didn’t reveal his identity; he merely turned to glance at the darkness behind him. Sensing that the stone Giants were about to catch up, he said directly.</p><p>“Ye Xiaotian, you’re Sleeveless’s friend. After the battle at Tiansang Spirit Palace, we became friends after a fight. Now to put it simply, you’re also my friend.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian : “???”</p><p>“Why did these words sound so wrong?”</p><p>With a spin of the Spatial Upanishad under his feet, Ye Xiaotian had the urge to leave.</p><p>“Hold on.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong reached out to stop him and said seriously, “Master Ye, my Junior Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou, must have caused a lot of trouble in your Tiansang Spirit Palace. It’s all thanks to your help that he’s able to grow in maturity till now. Please allow me to first thank you…thank you very much. He bent over.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian stopped in his tracks.</p><p>His first reaction was, “Oh my God, someone finally understands me.”</p><p>His second reaction was to be dumbfounded. Was this something that Bazhun’an would say? There’s something wrong with you!</p><p>“If you have something to say, just say it. What are you trying to say?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian forcefully suppressed his violent temper. He could not afford to provoke this person and would try his best not to. The pain of losing an arm was deeply engraved in his heart.</p><p>“As a token of gratitude, I would like to give you a treasure.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong straightened up and patted the Demon God’s great spear beside him. He was just about to ask this Spiritual Cultivator with the Spatial Attributes in front of him to help him share the responsibility of some of the Fire Power.</p><p>“I’m not interested,” Ye Xiaotian swept his gaze across the room and rejected him outrightly. At the same time, his body began to turn illusory.</p><p>“Don’t! Wait a minute!” Xiao Kongtong immediately panicked. It hadn’t been easy to find someone to share the responsibility of the Fire Power, you can’t run!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
