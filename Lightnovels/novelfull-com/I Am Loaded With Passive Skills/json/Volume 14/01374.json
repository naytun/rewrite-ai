Since a student like you can give this old man such a big gift, then I’ll treat this situation as your first lesson.”</p><p>“Let’s see how far you can go in this situation!”</p><p>Mei Siren gritted his teeth as he thought about it. He secretly hid the two wooden swords on his back, then took out two stone swords and carried them on his back.</p><p>This was what he had built in front of the Ember Domain.</p><p>Originally, when he heard about the explosion, he excitedly changed to the wooden swords. He thought that since he had just started teaching, he had to do it step by step and not be too harsh on Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Now, Mei Siren felt that what Bazhun’an said was true!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou should be beaten hard!</p><p>The wooden sword was not good for fighting, so the stone sword was the only way to make his student learn from the painful experience!</p><p>…</p><p>On the battlefield.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>On the intangible wall of the holy realm, Rao Yaoyao pulled out Cang Godhood Sword from her chest. Blood splattered in all directions, and her face was full of anger.</p><p>On the other hand, after such a long time, the void attendant had actually broken free from the suppression of the holy realm.</p><p>However, it didn’t act rashly. On the contrary, its four limbs were bound to the realm, and it was struggling for real. Its eyes were slightly nervous as it looked at the demi-saint, who was going crazy on the battlefield.</p><p>This demi-saint was a little ruthless. However, it was not sure so it should continue to observe the situation.</p><p>In short, it just couldn’t go over now.</p><p>If one looked carefully, the aura of the spiritual herbs in the Herb Garden Divine Farmer seemed to have suddenly disappeared from the demi-saint’s body. Perhaps he had been wronged?</p><p>The giant race could not fault innocent people!</p><p>Yes, that’s it!</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were focused on the demi-saint Jiang Buyi, who had his true body out, which was embedded with demi-saint’s will. He had clearly torn Teng Shanhai apart with one hand and ended his life.</p><p>At this moment, he still had not taken back his Saint Statue.</p><p>“Swish swish swish”</p><p>Under the influence of the Holy Power, the wind was howling, and it was bone-piercingly cold, like a blizzard.</p><p>He raised his bloodied right hand and the power of Demon God wrapped around it. The power it contained made one’s heart tremble.</p><p>Yes, even demi-saint Jiang Buyi felt that this level of power had surpassed the power of a demi-saint.</p><p>“As expected of the ‘demonic power’…”</p><p>“It’s so rich in power! It’s like the son of a Demon God!”</p><p>“But didn’t the Demon God of Abyss Island die? Could it be that he left behind an inheritance? Or perhaps Teng Shanhai is his descendant?”</p><p>“Or is it that there isn’t only one ‘Demon God’? There are also other demonic gods, races, or clones in Shengshen continent?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi had lived long enough and knew more secrets of the continent.</p><p>Although a demi-saint was strong, it was just a threshold between ‘mortal flesh’ and ‘conferred Saint’.</p><p>The true “Saint” in Shengshen continent would always be the “Holy Emperor.”</p><p>Just like the “10-realm spiritual cultivation”, the final step of the spiritual cultivation and sanctification was called the “10-realm Holy Emperor”.</p><p>The “10-realm Holy Emperor” weren’t sub-level realms that could be cultivated. It depended on how much a spiritual cultivator had accumulated before becoming a saint.</p><p>This was an acknowledgment of every spiritual cultivator’s talent, as well as a way to determine who was stronger or weaker among the Holy Emperors.</p><p>A Saint was just a Saint.</p><p>In the end, whether or not the spiritual cultivator could transcend, become a God, cross thousands of planes, and become immortal all depended on whether or not the spiritual cultivator could break through to the 7-realm Holy Emperor.</p><p>If one couldn’t, then the journey of the descendant of the Holy Emperor would end here.</p><p>If one was able to reach the 7-realm Holy Emperor, the higher one’s cultivation level, the more likely one would be to comprehend the power of the ancestral source.</p><p>The so-called “power of ancestral source” was a concept that those under the demi-saint realm who had some knowledge of the higher void level might come into contact with.</p><p>They called it simply “divine power” and “demonic power”.</p><p>These were the two most common types of ‘ancestral source power’.</p><p>Back then, the six Demi-Saint Families led by Dao Xuanji besieged the higher void clan, the Lei family. What was their true motive?</p><p>The God Devil Eyes had both “divine power” and “demonic power”. At that time, the strongest people in the Lei family were only at the higher void level. They could rival a demi-saint, and there were only five of them.</p><p>As the saying goes, an ordinary man is innocent, but he is guilty of keeping a treasure.</p><p>Jiang Buyi had participated in that war.</p><p>However, he had only just understood Dao Xuanji’s true intentions.</p><p>Moreover, in that battle, the most important “God Devil Eyes” had never appeared, not even when the entire Lei family was destroyed.</p><p>Perhaps it was just as the Lei family had said, the God Devil Eye was too difficult to be born.</p><p>However, not long ago, Jiang Buyi had heard some news and deduced the Holy Path. He understood that the time had come and released Jiang Xian. He used the Three Loathsome Eyes as bait to try to fish for the lost Lei family’s eyes.</p><p>Jiang Buyi swore that he had no intention of getting the position of Holy Emperor. This was true!</p><p>After all, to do this, one had to obtain the lost position of a Holy Emperor. This meant that one had to kill a Holy Emperor. Who in the world would dare to do this?</p><p>Jiang Buyi was simply curious about the divine objects below the demi-saint level that could possess the ancestral source power. Perhaps, after gathering them, he could successfully develop the monastic robe.</p><p>He didn’t even want the position of a Holy Emperor?</p><p>“Curiosity” was the driving force behind a spiritual cultivator’s progress. Becoming a demi-saint was not the end. Jiang Buyi also understood that any demi-saint in the world still had a tiny bit of hope for “further progress.”</p><p>It was just that they didn’t have the channels or the guts.</p><p>Jiang Buyi dared to participate in the battle to destroy the Lei family because he had a good relationship with the five great Holy Emperor Aristocratic Families. He also had the qualifications to talk to them and look down on them.</p><p>Now, before he could obtain any information of the God Devil Eye, the combat division’s head, Teng Shanhai, who he had torn apart in the Forest of Miracles, was suddenly bursting with such a dense “demonic power.”</p><p>“Bang Bang Bang!”</p><p>The blood-stained pieces of the Cang God armor froze on the ground.</p><p>As for Teng Shanhai’s torn pieces of flesh, under the stimulation of the dense power of Demon God, they continued to expand, merge, obliterate the will of death, and increase in vitality!</p><p>However, Jiang Buyi’s Holy Power suppressed this change and did not allow Teng Shanhai’s flesh and blood to regather and revive.</p><p>“Hu~”</p><p>After looking at the wriggling flesh and blood for a long time, Jiang Buyi sighed and turned to look at Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s pretty face was cold as she approached with her sword in hand. her eyes were filled with anger, but there was not a single trace of surprise at Teng Shanhai’s abnormal flesh and blood.</p><p>“She knows…”</p><p>“So the Cang God Armor was just a seal… So there are bigger matters behind Teng Shanhai… So her warning just now wasn’t just to protect him…”</p><p>Jiang Buyi closed his eyes heavily. When he slowly opened them again, the killing intent in his eyes grew even stronger!</p><p>So what if it was demonic power?</p><p>Could a demi-saint be so easily desecrated by a higher void?</p><p>He thought that Teng Shanhai was just an insignificant nobody and that if he killed this nobody, what could the Holy Divine Palace do to him?</p><p>Now that he had discovered that Teng Shanhai had a secret and was involved in the ancestral source power that even the demi-saints did not know about, how could Jiang Buyi let him go?</p><p>If he was ordinary, he would have died.</p><p>If he was a genius and used the demi-saint honorific name to suppress him, the Holy Divine Palace would not be able to settle the score with him even if Teng Shanhai died.</p><p>However, Teng Shanhai was actually a monster. The demonic power in his body was too strong. If this kind of person did not die, he would definitely become a saint in the future.</p><p>Would those who had demonic power be weaker than ordinary demi-saints when they became saints?</p><p>No!</p><p>He even had a tiny bit of hope of reaching the level of a Holy Emperor! As long as he chose to join the five Holy Emperor families! Forever loyal to the top!</p><p>When the time comes, he will turn into a dragon and fly in the wind and clouds.</p><p>Looking back, would Teng Shanhai choose to let go of his hatred for the demi-saint who had massacred him in the past?</p><p>“Bullshit!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi did not even need to think to know that if Teng Shanhai did not die today, he would not even have the slightest chance of being resurrected.</p><p>In the coming days, the general profound Jiang clan of the North Region would be completely annihilated!</p><p>To get rid of weeds, one must remove the roots!</p><p>If he was provoked, then he would kill him!</p><p>Moreover, he, Jiang Buyi, had given Rao Yaoyao enough respect previously.</p><p>In fact, he didn’t even take the initiative to provoke Teng Shanhai. It was the other party who had forced his head onto his sword and even shamelessly said that if he wouldn’t attack him, he was just a coward.</p><p>Who could tolerate this?</p><p>Jiang Buyi raised his hand, and the power of demi-saint embedded in the Saint Statue behind him was drawn to the extreme.</p><p>“Holy Light of Saints!”</p><p>He swung his palm down without hesitation.</p><p>The dark sky suddenly lit up, and countless beams of Holy Light fell from the sky.</p><p>Some of them fell on Teng Shanhai’s body, annihilating all signs of life by crushing the moving pieces of flesh and reducing them to nothingness.</p><p>Some of them stopped in the Abyss and covered every piece of Teng Shanhai’s soul. They did not allow Teng Shanhai to be reborn in any way.</p><p>“Jiang Buyi, stop!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s face was cold. She completely disregarded the difference in their cultivation realm and stepped on the tiny bit of Teng Shanhai’s blood. The divine sword, Xuan Cang in her hand was held horizontally in the sky to protect herself.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The Holy Light of Saints was the most powerful strike of a demi-saint, which could eliminate all filth and evil. How could a sword deity of the higher void realm withstand it?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was smashed into the ground with a bang. However, the divine sword Xuan Cang in her hand didn’t move at all. She gritted her teeth and blood seeped out of her mouth.</p><p>When Jiang Buyi saw this scene, his eyes almost popped out of their sockets.</p><p>“Move!!!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
