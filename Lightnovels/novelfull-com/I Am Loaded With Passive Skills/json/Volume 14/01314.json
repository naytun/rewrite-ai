A New Storm Had Appeared… 1</p><p>In the Sleeping Valley.</p><p>“Clang, Clang, Clang…”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong walked across the dust-covered land with a big sack in his hand. Everything he saw was strikingly desolate.</p><p>“Legend has it that in ancient times, the Abyss Island was a country of Giants. A group of Giants lived here and they only lived in the sky and never descended to the mortal world.”</p><p>“They had no worries about food and clothing and were self-sufficient. However, one day, a Demon God descended from the sky and wanted to seize this pure land.”</p><p>“Thus, the Giants and the Demon God fought in the most desolate place on Abyss Island. In the end, both sides perished and died on this piece of land.”</p><p>“The battlefield of this final battle later became one of the nine most dangerous lands on Abyss Island, the Sleeping Valley!”</p><p>These legendary tales flashed through his mind.</p><p>Dragging his sack, the scruffy-looking man glanced around his surroundings again.</p><p>Huge boulders with uneven bumps, mountains that were thousands of feet high and looked like the corpses of Giants, and broken swords that could petrify the sky…</p><p>He couldn’t help but gulp in fear.</p><p>“Why…”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong didn’t understand.</p><p>He was only under the Deep Sea, and when he faced the Ancient Gate, he couldn’t help being curious, so he gave it a little push.</p><p>“How did he end up in Abyss Island?”</p><p>“It’s all Senior Water Ghost’s fault for not telling me about the gravity of the situation when he told me not to push the door. He didn’t tell me the specific reason, and even made me wait for so long.”</p><p>“Isn’t it right? Everyone would wish to push the door open when they are facing it, right?”</p><p>“It’s really not my fault!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong comforted himself, as he dragged the sack and continued forward.</p><p>He had been wandering in this Sleeping Valley for a long time, but he still had not spotted any signs of life. He had not even seen a single weed.</p><p>This was a place of death!</p><p>“That’s why it can’t be called ‘Sleeping Valley’. It should be called ‘Fallen Land’. It’s a place that’s been dead for millions of years, yet it’s still called ‘Sleeping Valley’. It feels very scary.”</p><p>“It’s like if I’m not careful, the Giants and the Demon God might awaken…”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong complained silently.</p><p>Soon, he arrived in front of a dark cave.</p><p>“Was there a movement?”</p><p>He frowned and entered the cave.</p><p>Not long after, Xiao Kongtong stopped in front of a half-closed giant door.</p><p>Unlike the dead silence in the outside world, there seemed to be a powerful force sleeping inside the door. Only a trace of that power leaked out from the crack of the door, which made Xiao Kongtong’s heart palpitate.</p><p>“Don’t go in, don’t go in!”</p><p>“This door, don’t push It!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong had already been tricked by the so-called ‘door’ once in the Deep Sea World.</p><p>He had told himself in his mind ten thousand times that he should never make the same mistake again.</p><p>Let alone the Seven Breaks on the Shengshen continent, even ordinary people would definitely die if they set foot in it.</p><p>This was one of the nine most dangerous places on the Void Island, the Sleeping Valley and he had encountered a door by chance at this moment… needless to say, this was also Forbidden Grounds, a land of death!</p><p>“I’m sorry for disturbing you. I’ll leave now.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong made his decision in the time it took for an incense stick to burn totally, then he turned around and left.</p><p>However, just as he reached the entrance of the cave, he stopped again.</p><p>“Up till now, there hasn’t been any movement. Could it be that this place is just a fortuitous encounter and there are no risks?”</p><p>Looking out of the cave, the mountains that lay on the ground looked more and more like sleeping Giants. Perhaps this cave was where the legendary Demon God was sleeping.</p><p>It was very scary…</p><p>But…</p><p>“We are already at the Abyss Island, yet you are still so cautious. Don’t you think we might miss the opportunity?”</p><p>The two dwarfs in Xiao Kongtong’s mind began to fight. One urged him to leave quickly, while the other said that it was a pity to leave just like that since he was already here.</p><p>“I am the eldest Senior Brother of Fringe Moon Immortal City. Who in the world can stop me?”</p><p>“The Way of the Sword is to forge ahead courageously. I, the Swordsman, am strong and resolute!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong tightened his grip on the sack in his hand. He felt that the little fellow in his mind who gave him this advice would be talked to death by the other.</p><p>“I’ll give it a little push!”</p><p>Finally, he made a decision.</p><p>He would give it a try!</p><p>Returning to the half-closed door, Xiao Kongtong was mentally prepared. He reached out his hand and began to knock on the door.</p><p>“Knock, Knock, Knock.”</p><p>The sound echoed all around the cave, but nothing strange happened.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was emboldened. He looked tentatively through the crack of the door, cupped his fists, and said, “I didn’t mean to disturb you. I was just curious. If I offended you, Senior, please drive me away. Please don’t hurt me.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Except for the echoes, there was still no movement from the cave.</p><p>“Silence. This Junior should take it as acquiescence?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong nodded as his eyes glowed fervently.</p><p>“Adventure!”</p><p>It was something he hadn’t done for many years since he became the Eldest Senior Brother of Fringe Moon Immortal City.</p><p>It was the biggest motivation for a young man’s growth until now. Otherwise, how could he have pushed open that door under the Deep Sea and decided to push open another one at this moment?</p><p>“A new world, here I come!”</p><p>With a thumping heart, Xiao Kongtong reached out his hand and pushed.</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>The huge door was pushed inch by inch until finally, a crack that could accommodate three normal human-sized creatures was pushed open.</p><p>It was not pushed open all the way, this was respect for the ruins.</p><p>Pushing it open this much, this was respect for life.</p><p>If the huge door should close accidentally, Xiao Kongtong was confident that he could get out of the door with a crack of this size.</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong said apologetically and stepped through the giant door excitedly with a sack on his shoulder.</p><p>Buzz…</p><p>As soon as he stepped in, the pure energy fluctuations inside caught all of Xiao Kongtong’s attention.</p><p>It was a black Giant!</p><p>The giant corpse was sitting on a huge Sovereign Stage throne inside the door.</p><p>It had on the toughest Demon God armor, and held a giant spear that could pierce through the sky. It also had a helmet on its head. Even though it was a corpse, it still emitted a strong murderous aura.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
