No matter how much trouble he stirred up, could he overturn the heavens?</p><p>If they met, he was confident that Xu Xiaoshou would not be his match in a one-on-one fight!</p><p>“Brother Hong Dang!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at his disdainful expression and said earnestly, “Let me give you a piece of advice. Even if you really join the Holy Divine Palace and if you meet that Xu guy in the future, just run away and maybe you can still keep your ‘dog life’.”</p><p>“Hehe!” Hong Dang sneered.</p><p>He didn’t understand why the Double Dumba*s were so afraid of a Junior. He was only a Master Stage! A Master Stage!</p><p>But…</p><p>A small-time assassin who had been living in the Central Region was just trying to seek a peaceful life.</p><p>Now that he had come to the Eastern Region and witnessed the battle between the Saints, he was shocked by the ability of one of the chess pieces, Xu Xiaoshou, and became timid.</p><p>It was excusable!</p><p>“Brother Double Dumba*s is afraid, but there’s no need to impose fear on me.” Hong Dang sneered.</p><p>He thought that perhaps it was because they were scared out of their wits that when Xu Xiaoshou opened the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, they didn’t even dare to go over and get their share.</p><p>Such a waste of a divine opportunity made Hong Dang look down on this killer even more.</p><p>“Ai.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at this muscular, simple-minded, bare-chested man from head to toe. He didn’t say anything more and just sighed softly.</p><p>That was all.</p><p>He didn’t want to make another enemy, so he would try to persuade them to retreat.</p><p>However, the world did not know about Xu Xiaoshou’s terrifying battle achievements. What they knew was only the tip of the iceberg, so they always looked down on him.</p><p>“Let’s get back to business.”</p><p>Hong Dang didn’t want to talk about that detestable Xu Xiaoshou anymore.</p><p>When he thought of how he had not arrived earlier and could have had a share of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, he regretted having slowed down so much earlier and had always been on guard against the imaginary enemy in the air.</p><p>What a pity, what a pity…</p><p>“Who’s the Guardian?” Hong Dang stared at the Barrier, guessing that the Guardian of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer couldn’t be any ordinary being.</p><p>“A Giant.” Xu Xiaoshou pulled himself back to reality and said seriously.</p><p>“Giant?” Hong Dang shivered, thinking of the rustling sounds he had heard along the way. He thought to himself, “Could it have been the footsteps of the Giant chasing the medicine thief, Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“How big is the Giant?” Hong Dang asked. This was a matter of life and death, and he had to be clear on how much Fire Power he needed to attract.</p><p>“More than thirty feet high.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chose his words carefully, afraid of scaring away his first collaborator.</p><p>“Well, three thousand feet and more than thirty feet were indeed the same concept, right?”</p><p>“That’s fine. After my Dragon Soul possesses my body, it will exceed ten feet.” He nodded and asked again, “How strong are the Giants?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought for a moment and then replied sincerely, “Xu Xiaoshou might be able to defeat them with his Sovereign Physique, but I’ve never seen them fight before. So, this should be the first criteria if you wish to fight against the Giants.”</p><p>“Well, the initial criteria was to be at the Sovereign Physique, but there was no cap to the upper limit. This could be considered an honest answer, right?”</p><p>“That’s fine. I have a Sovereign Physique that is rare in the Universe. After I summon the Dragon Soul, those ordinary Sovereign Physique are no match for me. If Xu Xiaoshou can defeat them, I think I am capable of it too.” He nodded and said, “How many Giants are there?”</p><p>“Just one,” Xu Xiaoshou’s voice became serious. He knew what the question meant, that he was not afraid.</p><p>“Ha!” Hong Dang laughed.</p><p>“Brother Double Dumba*s, don’t worry. I’ll only go in and pick one Holy Medicine, but I get to choose the category of the Holy Medicine first. After that, you’re not allowed to compete with me!”</p><p>“As for the mere Giant, I’ll come back after I shake him off.”</p><p>“When the time comes, I hope Brother won’t forget about our cooperation agreement!”</p><p>Hong Dang stared at the killer in front of him, trying to see his true face.</p><p>“Naturally.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded calmly. “Our agreement was 30:70% and since I’m taking the bigger share, there’s no need to trick you. In fact, even if you only get 10% of the Holy Medicine in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, you won’t be short of Spiritual Medicine for the rest of your life.”</p><p>Hong Dang’s eyebrows rose, and he glanced at the vast Barrier again. He couldn’t hide the fire in his heart.</p><p>“Was it really that magical?”</p><p>“Could it be my opportunity is really coming?”</p><p>“Brother Double Dumba*s, let’s not talk anymore. Please use the Array Shattering. I’ll protect you! Hong Dang pointed with his finger, as his heart started to beat wildly.</p><p>“Alright,” he said.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t say anything else.</p><p>He and Lei Xi ‘er had studied the array of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer thoroughly while they were squatting on the tree.</p><p>Time could wear everything out. If this was when the sealed Barrier was first created, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t guarantee that he could break it with his Sovereign Stage, ‘Weaving Expertise’.</p><p>However, after millions of years, at a glance, one could tell that the Barrier in front of him was full of flaws!</p><p>The Void Attendant was the Guardian of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, but it was obvious that the Void Attendant was not a master of Spiritual Arrays and could not maintain this sealed Barrier.</p><p>So…</p><p>In order to maintain the impression that ‘The Array Shattering Method was difficult, but due to the fact that I will get 70% of the benefits’, Xu Xiaoshou put on an act and wasted half an hour outside the Barrier.</p><p>Only when Hong Xin was so anxious that he paced back and forth did he smile.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>He pointed at a hole in the Barrier.</p><p>The Spiritual Source transformed into a thread, which turned into a bridge that connected the Barrier and instantly constructed a passageway that could allow one person to pass through the Barrier.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>As soon as the passageway was formed, the rich medicinal fragrance and Spiritual Energy in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer gushed out in waves that were visible to the naked eye.</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s Energy Reserve leapt and his knees tightened. He almost failed to suppress his level and nearly broke through on the spot.</p><p>However, he could not break through!</p><p>If this were to happen, if the fluctuations of a Master Stage breakthrough were released, then wouldn’t Hong Dang be instantly dumbfounded?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face had a half-concealed and half-real fanatical look, and embellished with the illusion of 100% weakness, he said weakly, “Brother Hong Dang, please.”</p><p>“Brother Hong Dang, please die!”</p><p>Of course, he couldn’t say the word ‘die’.</p><p>After Xu Xiaoshou finished speaking, he inhaled the rich medicinal fragrance that lingered at the tip of his nose. He knew that if he wanted to maintain the image of Double Dumba*s, he couldn’t afford to be modest at this moment.</p><p>As soon as his words fell, his body turned into a stream of light, which rushed directly toward the Barrier passage.</p><p>A normal person would stay vigilant when he faced a killer who was so modest, but even a weak killer who had just broken through the Barrier couldn’t resist the smell of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer and chose to rush in first.</p><p>He would naturally abandon his rationality!</p><p>It had to be said that Hong Dang completely grasped what was behind Xu Xiaoshou’s rationale.</p><p>Hong Dang was still reminiscing about the rich medicinal fragrance that was so heady that it caused his Energy Reserve to fluctuate. When he turned around, Double Dumba*s was gone.</p><p>His eyes instantly turned scarlet red.</p><p>“Damn you Double Dumba*s! We’re supposed to be working together and I’m the one who should be charging in! Don’t you go against the contract!” He stomped his feet, and like a cannonball, he also rushed into the Barrier passageway.</p><p>At this moment, Hong Dang didn’t have time to think. If Double Dumba*s really wanted to do it on his own after breaking the formation, then what was the point of him staying here and waiting for others to cooperate?</p><p>If he thought about it carefully, Hong Dang would definitely realize that there was a trap!</p><p>But on second thought?</p><p>“What kind of crappy joke is this!”</p><p>If he had been a step slower! No, half a step!</p><p>If he had been half a step slower, all the Holy Medicine in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer would have been taken away by Double Dumba*s!</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Hong Dang made a preemptive attack. He was surprisingly fast, even faster than Double Dumba*s as he charged into the Barrier.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s Double Dumba*s incarnation of Xu Xiaoshou followed him without any hesitation. It was as if he had never thought of waiting quietly behind him.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>On the ancient tree, Lei Xi ‘er, who was hiding in the Bounded Domain of the White Cave Small World, had a trace of worry in her eyes.</p><p>She didn’t expect that in order to trick Hong Dang into entering the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, Xu Xiaoshou would actually follow him in as well.</p><p>If the Void Attendant were to be awakened again, wouldn’t he be able to kill the two of them with one kick?</p><p>Almost at the same time, Lei Xi ‘er stood on tiptoe and was about to rush inside the Barrier as well.</p><p>At this moment, Greedy the Cat Spirit let out a soft meow.</p><p>Lei Xi’er instantly calmed down.</p><p>“Wait, something’s wrong. I’m actually worried about Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“Did I get too carried away, or have I been following Xu Xiaoshou for too long already and have a problem with my brain?”</p><p>“Does he still need me to worry about him?”</p><p>Lei Xi-er squatted back on the ancient tree and waited silently. At the same time, she prayed in her heart.</p><p>“Hong Dang…”</p><p>“Is that his name?”</p><p>“I hope you can run away when you can’t find Xu Xiaoshou and after you pluck the Holy Medicine, should the Void Attendant appear, you will be able to escape.”</p><p>Just like what Xu Xiaoshou had said, he would run away like crazy when he met Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Only in this way…</p><p>“Perhaps, this is the only way you will be able to survive!”</p><p>“May the Heavens bless you.” Lei Xi ‘er clutched the tree branch tightly, looked at the Barrier passageway and whispered.</p><p>“Meow”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit looked up at its mistress, raised its two front paws, and meowed.</p><p>“Brother Hong Dang, that’s his name right?”</p><p>“Meow Meow!”</p><p>“Brother Hong Dang, may the Lord bless you!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
