Even the void attendant was scared. Then, he began to swallow the ice energy that was attacking him.</p><p>Delicious, delicious.</p><p>“Roar…”</p><p>Under Lei Xi’er, the ice blue-white skeleton, Ice, finally roared.</p><p>As the energy overflowed, the ice-type Upanishad spirit array under its feet opened up.</p><p>As far as one’s eye could see…</p><p>From Ice to double dumba*s, even under the suppression of Holy Power, more than ten ice-type Upanishad spirit arrays suddenly lit up along the way, as if the Upanishad was leading to the path of becoming a saint!</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>Double Dumba*s was dumbfounded.</p><p>Spiritual arrays of Upanishad?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not grasp the Upanishad, and neither did the silver-haired girl.</p><p>Yet their mount did???</p><p>“What a bunch of freaks!”</p><p>Double Dumba*s was about to go crazy.</p><p>However, his craziness hadn’t materialized into a real attack yet.</p><p>The dazzling ice-type spiritual array of Upanishad had its energy expanded to the maximum under the Three Days Frozen Calamity.</p><p>“Ice Age!”</p><p>Ice couldn’t speak, so Xu Xiaoshou stood with his sword and said indifferently…He liked this kind of time when he didn’t need to do anything other than give a command.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking.</p><p>“Boom boom boom boom boom boom!!”</p><p>A terrifying explosion of ice sounded for dozens of miles. The ancient forest on the battlefield was completely covered in frost.</p><p>Even the void attendants watching the battle had turned into frozen giants because they didn’t have time to swallow a large amount of ice-type energy.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>The world froze.</p><p>The shattered trees stopped in mid-air, and the dust from the explosion condensed in the nine heavens.</p><p>At the center of the frost storm, double dumba*s, whose entire body was filled with the pressure of a demi-saint, was completely frozen before he could vent the power he had just received.</p><p>“PFFT…”</p><p>A special sound came from the Infernal White Flame.</p><p>“Hohoho!”</p><p>In the next second, the Infernal White Skeleton, Ember, was so excited that it beat its chest and stamped its feet.</p><p>It was not affected by the power of the frost at all. After watching the battle for so long and not being able to intervene, Ember had long been unable to endure its hunger and thirst.</p><p>Now that this enemy was not with its owner, it finally did not have to worry and could now destroy everyone with its punch.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>It suddenly bent its knees.</p><p>Ember was like a giant cannonball. Infernal White Flame exploded under its feet and it threw a punch at the ice sculpture, Double Dumba * s.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Ice-type Upanishad’s freezing power was extremely strong, but holy power was not undeserved.</p><p>In just half a breath, double dumba*s broke free from the freezing power and completely shattered the ice sculpture.</p><p>However, just as his vision recovered from the darkness, a huge fist with a burning light completely dyed the world in front of him white.</p><p>“What the f*ck…”</p><p>Double Dumba*s was stunned.</p><p>At a certain moment, he even recalled the fear of being controlled by the void attendant.</p><p>The reason was that this fist in front of him was no different from the feet of the void attendant from a human’s point of view!</p><p>Big!</p><p>Very Big!</p><p>Super Big!</p><p>“Bang-”</p><p>As the fist was raised, time seemed to slow down in front of this absolute power.</p><p>Double Dumba*s only felt that the world in front of him was twisting…</p><p>His eyeballs were under the force and almost flew out of his eye sockets; his teeth fell off and flew out of the blurry world along with his blood; his body was smashed into pieces, and his elbow fell off and pierced into his heart and lungs…</p><p>“F*ck! F*ck! F*ck!”</p><p>In the quiet world of consciousness, double dumba*s became confused and hesitant.</p><p>He didn’t understand.</p><p>Was Xu Xiaoshou really at the master stage?</p><p>Was the combat strength of a cutting path written on the black gold bounty really measured?</p><p>It was one thing for him to be so strong, but his little girlfriend also had the Lei family’s eyes.</p><p>Other than the Lei family’s eyes, even their mounts were giants.</p><p>It was one thing for giants, but for one to have mastered the ice-type Upanishad and the other to have physical strength, they were more terrifying than anything he had ever seen in his life…They were not weaker than the void attendants at all!</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>His demi-saint’s power had just appeared, and he did not have the time to display its power.</p><p>After Ember’s punch, double dumba*s was blasted from the ground and turned into a pile of meat paste that scattered into the sky.</p><p>“Monkey monkey!”</p><p>After the battle ended, Ember was as excited as a monkey. It turned its head and jumped around, waving its hands and feet at Xu Xiaoshou, as if it was saying, “Look at me! Look at me!”</p><p>“I have destroyed my opponent with a single punch. Wasn’t I strong?”</p><p>“Quickly praise me! Quickly praise me!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
