She seemed to have lost her mind and it had been a relatively difficult situation as she didn’t even respond when everyone asked her to make a decision.</p><p>It was like…</p><p>Now that he knew the truth and understood what happened before, he really felt like an idiot!</p><p>He had unwittingly played into the palm of someone else’s hand. Therefore, after he reacted, he lost the ability to judge any person, thing, or thing in the world for a short time.</p><p>“So, Rao Yaoyao already understood what went on at that time? And so she went crazy?”</p><p>“And until now, if I had not heard it from Xu Xiaoshou, I would still naively think that Xu Xiaoshou was really Huang Quan and Huang Quan was still Huang Quan?”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The ground suddenly crumbled.</p><p>A black and red demonic qi that was visible to the naked eye erupted from the Xiao Divine Spear and wrapped itself around Teng Shanhai’s body and dyed his single eye a bright blood red color.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The space suddenly collapsed.</p><p>The surrounding Bounded Domain twisted and collapsed. The strong murderous intent gave way to morph forms like wolves, tigers, and leopards, which were extremely ferocious and tore the endless void.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Teng Shanhai, who wore the Cang God armor and held the Xiao Divine Spear, leaped into the sky. He turned into a black-red light and struck down with his spear.</p><p>“Xiao Divine Spear, Godhood break the vast ocean!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, go to hell!!!”</p><p>His Holy Power surged and his aura rose to its peak at this moment.</p><p>In Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes, he felt that the entire Bounded Domain had turned into an endless ocean at this moment, and he was like a leaf on a small boat in the middle of the ocean, which drifted about with no one to rely on.</p><p>If the spear hit its target, not only would the boat be shattered, even the vast ocean would be split into two!</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The sonic boom exploded, and the space spread in all directions. The air flow turned into a huge mushroom cloud, which suddenly rose in the air where Xu Xiaoshou was.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also had Holy Power.</p><p>However, he was not stupid enough to use the accompanying Holy Power of the Holy Miracle Fruit to counter the blow of the Higher Void level’s rage after it had taken the Holy Blood.</p><p>The ‘Vanishing Technique’ allowed him to take the easy way out.</p><p>He fell into the sky while Teng Shanhai blasted the ground with his spear. Teng Shanhai stood in the deep abyss as they exchanged positions.</p><p>“Great!!”</p><p>How ashamed and angry would you be when your own Bounded Domain was destroyed?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked, but he quickly calmed down.</p><p>“You’re anxious, you’re anxious…”</p><p>He grinned hideously as he looked at Teng Shanhai, who was about to be devoured by the evil aura of the Xiao Divine Spear, then laughed and said,</p><p>“Teng Shanhai, you’re really too anxious!”</p><p>“What’s the point of killing me here? This can’t conceal your stupidity.”</p><p>“Ahem!”</p><p>As he cleared his throat, Xu Xiaoshou pinched his throat and in a melodious voice like the Bard, said,</p><p>“Your stupidity can create a continuous mess and make people’s hearts break with laughter!”</p><p>“If I were you, I would kill myself with the Xiao Divine Spear. I wouldn’t ask for blood to prove my innocence, but instead would leave a heroic name for thousands of years.”</p><p>“If that wasn’t the case, when I, Xu Xiaoshou, return to the Shengshen Continent, there would be bards praising the deeds of the Lone Cliff day and night and spreading the ‘heroic deeds’ that you and Yaoyao had done!”</p><p>“After a meal, I’ll always take a rest. Then the laughable Sword Deity Rao and the hilarious Chief Teng would make an appearance.”</p><p>“Oh, that’s right!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou patted his face, then suddenly a sneaky look appeared, as if he remembered something and sighed,</p><p>“Don’t worry, Teng Shanhai. Even if you’re a joke, you’re not the main character. Rao Yaoyao is.”</p><p>“You’re just a marginal person. You won’t be able to get a title out of the ten seats, and you won’t be the strongest in the six divisions of the Holy Divine Palace. Even if you appeared at the Lone Cliff, you’ll only be a firefly beside the bright moon for all eternity. ”</p><p>“Even in a joke, you are just a supporting role!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou squinted and paused after each word, and said in a cold voice, “You’re not worth mentioning.”</p><p>“Ah…!”</p><p>In the underground abyss, an angry beast roared and held the Xiao Divine Spear as if it was about to lose its sanity.</p><p>This was nothing more than killing people and destroying their hearts!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Teng Shanhai gritted his teeth so hard that his gums bled. His eyes almost popped out as he said, “You only want to provoke me! Do you really think I don’t know?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou put him hands on his hips and laughed, “I succeeded, didn’t I?”</p><p>As he floated in the air, he waved his sleeve again and sneered, “I, Xu Xiaoshou, have never been defeated in my life. Even if I were to conspire against you Teng Shanhai, what can you do to me?”</p><p>“Teng Shanhai, I’ll give you a chance. However…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou crouched in the sky and muttered devilishly, but his voice spread beyond the Bounded Domain.</p><p>“You, can you kill me?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
