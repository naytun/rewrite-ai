Brother is just a small Fire Power attractor. If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t even get 10% of the Spiritual Medicine.”</p><p>“The 10:90% split is impossible!” Hong Dang sneered. “Even if the great merit and Array Shattering is in your hands and I’m merely the Fire Power attractor… without a 40:60% share, I won’t agree!”</p><p>“20:80%!”</p><p>“40:60%!”</p><p>“30:70%!”</p><p>“Good deal. 30:70%, it is then. I’ll take 30% and you take 70%!” Hong Dang suddenly agreed.</p><p>After all, he wasn’t a Spirit Array Caster. If he tried to forcefully attack this Barrier, he would probably only attract the counterattack of the Guardian of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>At that time, not to mention his 30% share, he might not even be able to obtain a single stalk of the Holy Medicine.</p><p>Since that was the case, Hong Dang was happy that Double Dumba*s was able to break the Array.</p><p>He only had to attract the Fire Power, and he wouldn’t die. Hong Dang was very confident of his own life-saving means.</p><p>And from this 19% to 30% splitting of shares, from such an exaggerated distribution of benefits, Hong Dang also saw Double Dumba*s greedy nature.</p><p>He finally believed that the Spiritual Medicine produced in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer might really be as amazing as what the other party had said.</p><p>Otherwise, this fellow would have agreed on a 50-50% split and might then stab him in the back. He would then have taken 100%.</p><p>The reason why he was agreeable to compromise at this point was probably because he did not want to waste time in case too many people turned up.</p><p>“Happy cooperation.” Xu Xiaoshou sneered as he extended his hand. He had this thought that no one would want to shake hands with a killer.</p><p>Hong Dang glanced at him. Indeed, he did not want to shake hands. He only said, “What sort of Fire Power do I need to attract?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had long expected this and was not embarrassed at all. He put down his hand and said,</p><p>“After I break the Array, there will be a passageway that will only allow one person to enter and exit.”</p><p>“When that time comes, Brother Hong Dang will go in first. When you pick any Holy Medicine, it will trigger the Guardian to react.”</p><p>“You can just run away. After all, the person from before had also made his getaway.”</p><p>“Pick any random Holy Medicine and you can… Hong Dang’s eyebrows jumped wildly when he heard this.</p><p>“Listen up, is this even human language?”</p><p>“What kind of surprise would the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer spring on people?”</p><p>“The person that Brother Double Dumba*s has been talking about, is he…” Hong Dang couldn’t help but ask.</p><p>He was too curious. Someone was able to make a move in front of this greedy Double Dumba*s. In the end, Double Dumba*s might not even dare to venture into the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>“How strong was this person?”</p><p>He sounded very intimidating!</p><p>“He…” Xu Xiaoshou hesitated. A sincere person would not want to lie unless it was absolutely necessary.</p><p>“Brother Double Dumba*s, don’t forget, we’re working together!” Hong Dang chuckled, with an expression that said, “If you don’t tell me, I won’t cooperate.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was helpless. He spread his hands and said, “He is Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Just one Xu Xiaoshou, he is able to scare Brother Double Dumba*s?” Hong Dang felt incredulous.</p><p>Of course he knew who Xu Xiaoshou was!</p><p>He was with Rao Yaoyao and Teng Shanhai during the battle at the Yunlun Mountain Range, although he had no direct dealing with this Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>But word on the street was that this guy was a shit-stirrer with a low cultivation level, and he exceled at stirring up trouble everywhere, which was a classic example of the his style of annihilation.</p><p>Unfortunately…</p><p>Up until now, Xu Xiaoshou should still be alive.</p><p>In other words, that guy hadn’t even done half of the things and was still living happily.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is not as simple as you think!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s Double Dumba*s sneered, raised his voice, and advised,</p><p>“As a Gold Hunting Token killer, I came from the Central Region this time to kill Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>“However, before we met, I fell into his trap.”</p><p>“On the Lone Cliff, Brother Hong Dang, do you still remember how that kid resisted Rao Yaoyao and Teng Shanhai and was still not at a disadvantage?”</p><p>“On the contrary, the two of us were like outsiders in that situation. We didn’t get involved at all. In the end, we were manipulated and fell into the Deep Sea.”</p><p>“From this, Brother Hong Dang, can’t you see how powerful Xu Xiaoshou is?”</p><p>Hong Dang listened dazedly to the Double Dumba*s in front of him. He didn’t expect that Xu Xiaoshou’s evaluation in the eyes of the enemy at the Grandmaster Realm would be so high.</p><p>But thinking about it carefully, wasn’t the Double Dumba*s evaluation a little too much?</p><p>“Despised, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>The information bar suddenly jumped.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was slightly stunned. Looking at Hong Dang’s expression, he could not have thoughts to such an extent, right?</p><p>There was no third person at the scene…</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>“It’s you again, Junior Sister.”</p><p>“Is there anything wrong? If I don’t get praised by anyone and you did not praise me, then why can’t I praise myself?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly became excited. He shook his head and said with emotion,</p><p>“Speaking of Xu Xiaoshou, now I don’t dare to think about him at all…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou’s talent is not inferior to mine; Xu Xiaoshou’s wisdom is the best among the Sword Deity; Xu Xiaoshou’s bravery is unmatched at the Lone Cliff; Xu Xiaoshou’s ability is such that other than the Eighth Sword Deity whom I have never met, I have yet to find anyone else on the Shengshen continent who can match up to him!”</p><p>This undisguised praise really stunned Hong Dang.</p><p>“Suspected, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Disliked, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Hehe, it’s you again, Junior sister…” Xu Xiaoshou almost turned around to glare at Lei Xi’er who was hiding in the White Cave Small World.</p><p>“Brother Double Dumba*s, you have such a high opinion of Xu Xiaoshou?” Hong Dang was suspicious. At one point, he even suspected that Double Dumba*s was Xu Xiaoshou’s accomplice in secret. Otherwise, why would he praise a Master Stage Junior in such an excessive way?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said calmly, “Isn’t the person who knows his opponent best not really his opponent?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
