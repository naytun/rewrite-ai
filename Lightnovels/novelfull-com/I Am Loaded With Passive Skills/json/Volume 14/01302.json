The True King Of The Giant Kingdom! 1</p><p>“He’s dried up, but not dead yet.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou poured a bucket of cold water on Ember. He stared unblinkingly at double dumba*s, who had turned into mud and was stuck on the ice tree.</p><p>It was very difficult to kill a sovereign, let alone a higher void.</p><p>A higher void could be defeated with absolute physical damage, but it was absolutely impossible to kill them.</p><p>This was the reason why most spiritual cultivators possessed some other strange abilities after reaching the sovereign stage.</p><p>If one wanted to end the enemy, it was impossible to do so by normal means.</p><p>One had to be different!</p><p>“Hehehe…”</p><p>As expected, in just a short while, the pile of flesh and mud disintegrated, and golden spots gathered, forming a hazy double dumba*s figure.</p><p>“Strong!”</p><p>“You’re indeed strong!”</p><p>“As expected of someone who can be on the black gold bounty. Xu Xiaoshou, you are indeed harder to deal with than I thought…”</p><p>Double Dumba*s panted weakly, but his expression was as ferocious as a mad dog. His eyes were filled with a strong bloodlust as if he was going to risk everything and fight to the death.</p><p>“Impressive!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and sighed. Although he had expected it, seeing a cockroach that would not die no matter what made him sigh.</p><p>In the next second, without waiting for double dumba*s to recover, he carried the big rock under his feet and took the easy way out in one step, appearing in front of double dumba*s.</p><p>“So much nonsense. Are you just trying to stall for time?”</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>He swung the Void Suppression Stele and smashed it directly. Xu Xiaoshou did not want to give double dumba*s time to catch his breath.</p><p>As a gold-hunting token killer, even if this guy was only on his last breath, he would probably be able to display an unexpected technique. He might even be able to exchange half of his life for a counterattack on the verge of death.</p><p>However, using the Void Suppression Stele to attack was different.</p><p>No matter how Double Dumba*s retaliated, given his current state, there was a high chance that he wouldn’t be able to break through the defense of the Void Suppression Stele.</p><p>If he was to miss his next move, the Void Suppression Stele would be able to completely suppress his spiritual source.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know whether it would be effective against the Holy Power…</p><p>However, he had to give it a try. Perhaps, he might be able to suppress it all?</p><p>“How can that fellow even use a stele to attack…”</p><p>Double Dumba* s stared blankly at the Void Suppression Stele that was smashing down on him. The madness in his eyes had turned into shock for a moment.</p><p>He had seen this before. It was the stele that he was unable to leave his name on the moment he stepped onto Abyss Island.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou actually carried it over to fight?</p><p>What kind of imagination was this?</p><p>“Dissolve the World!”</p><p>Double Dumba*s did not dare to delay. He used the little bit of holy power that he did not have the time to use just now to hang his life and activated the higher void world without hesitation.</p><p>Different from the bounded domain, the higher void world was like the manifestation of a spiritual cultivator’s spiritual body and consciousness.</p><p>Some people lacked offensive means and would turn the higher void world into a powerful offensive tool; some people lacked defense and would turn the higher void world into the most indestructible shield.</p><p>Double Dumba*s was different.</p><p>His offensive and defensive means were lacking, but as an assassin, it was always better to have as many life-saving means as possible.</p><p>This ‘Dissolved World’ was not used for damage output and defense. It was used at the last moment by a fugitive!</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>With an order, the pressure of holy power spread out again.</p><p>The area within a radius of ten miles was covered in a layer of hazy golden fog. In the blink of an eye, the double dumba*s split into two, two, and three…they turned into countless splits and dispersed in different directions.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smashed down with a stele, smashing the double dumba*s in front of him into pieces.</p><p>This violent hammer strike caused the ground to shake and then crack.</p><p>However, only one double dumba*s was smashed into pieces and tens of thousands of double dumba*s were fleeing in all directions.</p><p>“This fellow…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was momentarily stunned.</p><p>Just now, when the double dumba*s acted like a mad dog, he thought that this fellow was going to use a last-ditch attack.</p><p>He didn’t expect that his final attack would be to run for his life!</p><p>He had no intention of attacking or defending at all. All he wanted to do was to run as far as he could.</p><p>Double Dumba*s, who was in the higher void state and had mastered holy power, was facing two white skeleton giants, Xu Xiaoshou, and Lei Xi’er..</p><p>He didn’t even want to resist anymore.</p><p>He just ran!</p><p>“So pathetic.”</p><p>Although Xu Xiaoshou could understand the double dumba*s’s choice as an assassin and didn’t want to fight back.</p><p>However…</p><p>“Is it useful to run in front of me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s spiritual source in his energy reserve was summoned, and he instantly gathered the spiritual source that he hadn’t used for a long time.</p><p>He usually used his body in fights, and if he didn’t use his sword, he rarely used the methods of a spiritual cultivator because compared to the first two, he was only at the master stage in spiritual cultivation.</p><p>However, in his master stage Heavenly Image State, the energy reserve was embedded with the Infernal Original Seed, which contained calamity power.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s use of the infernal lineage was by no means limited to the Infernal Heavens Alchemy technique and explosions.</p><p>At the moment, with so many double dumba*s running in all directions, his physical strength could not keep up, and his way of the sword could hardly catch the real body and kill it.</p><p>However, a spiritual cultivation ability can do AOE group damage!</p><p>“PFFT…”</p><p>In half a breath’s time, the spiritual source of his energy reserve was drawn out.</p><p>At this time, the Double Dumba*s clones, which were at the higher void level, were so fast that they were already ten miles away.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not move at all. He recalled the scene of Elder Sang rising from the Hundred Thousand Mountains and blooming in the world of white flame.</p><p>He detonated the compressed energy from the infernal original seed!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The heat waves on his body exploded, and Xu Xiaoshou’s body swelled up. At this moment, white flames were burning, and he was like a flame god bathing in flames.</p><p>“Attacked, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Attacked, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“It really hurts…”</p><p>The seal of Infernal Original Seed was casted with the help of the wretched saint’s white light bead.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
