A relieved smile appeared on his face as he looked at the light in the outside world that had been missing for some time.</p><p>“A maze?”</p><p>“What kind of joke is this? Do you really think my Space Attributes are just for show? The maze can trap me?”</p><p>“However…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian still felt a lingering fear at the thought of meeting the super Giant Void Attendant every time he turned a corner while he was trapped in the maze.</p><p>On the Lone Cliff, after obtaining Aje, according to the original plan, he should have ended his trip to the YunLun Mountain Range and returned to the Tiansang Spirit Palace to cooperate with Qiao Qianzhi and carry out his experiments.</p><p>However, plans could never keep up with changes.</p><p>During his trip to the Deep Sea this time, he failed to drain a Spatial Upanishad Spiritual Cultivator like him. Now, he was being chased by the Void Attendant in the maze at the Great Hall on the Abyss Island. He had almost lost his life here.</p><p>Turning around, Ye Xiaotian took a good look at the plaque on the door of the Great Hall, and a look of ‘as expected’ appeared on his face.</p><p>“First Hall of Sins.”</p><p>“You’re worthy to be one of the nine most dangerous places on Abyss Island!”</p><p>“It is a good place. It’s a pity that there are no Void Crystals and the treasures cannot be exchanged. I almost lost my life here.”</p><p>“I won’t be able to come back to this wretched place in the future!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian did not want to think about the painful experience he had in the inner hall.</p><p>All he wanted to do now was to take a look around the Void Island and wait for the time when he could leave this lousy place and return to the Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>He looked down on other people who desired the Foundational Roots of Saint Ascension.</p><p>With the completion of the final-stage Spatial Upanishad, Ye Xiaotian had already embarked on a path that belonged to him alone.</p><p>At present, he still had some way to go before he reached the Higher Void level, so there was no need to even think about becoming a Demi-Saint.</p><p>As long as he used the Spatial Upanishad to reach the Higher Void level, who in the world could be his match?</p><p>At that time, if he wanted the Semi-Saint Person, wouldn’t it only be in one sentence?</p><p>In this vast world, which force wouldn’t want this rare Ye person, who had mastered the Spatial Upanishad to be in their grasp?</p><p>“It’s time to take a break.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian flipped his hand, and the Spatial Upanishad beneath his feet began to spin.</p><p>As the Spatial Master, he did not even have the time to take a good look at the Abyss Island.</p><p>Now that he finally had the time, Ye Xiaotian felt that it would be a waste of his lifetime’s worth of cultivation if he did not sneak a peek at the people and things in this place from a God’s perspective.</p><p>“Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.”</p><p>He waved his hand in the Void, and many Spatial Mirrors appeared in front of him, reflecting figures who were either in a sorry, happy, or desperate state.</p><p>Outside a distant and ancient-looking forest, a white-haired, good looking swordsman who carried two wooden swords stopped and looked around. He fanned himself as he walked into the forest.</p><p>“He looks a little familiar.”</p><p>“Where have I seen this person before?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian pondered for a moment. He had never seen this person on the Lone Cliff before. Perhaps he had fallen into the Deep Sea after that.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the next Mirror world appeared.</p><p>Still outside the ancient forest, a black-robed hero without eyebrows slowly walked forward, his expression vigilant.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was on high alert as well, because not only were there people in the image, but there were a fast rhythmic roar.</p><p>“Mu Ling?”</p><p>“The forest again?”</p><p>“Why did everyone fall into the forest? I’m the only one who’s unlucky enough to go to the First Hall of Sins?”</p><p>“There’s also this roaring sound. There were also some sounds in the previous image. Were they all in the same place? Ye Xiaotian gritted his teeth. It’s so explosive, it’s so like Xu XiaoShou!</p><p>He didn’t take another look. With another swipe, the screen changed.</p><p>It was still in the ancient forest, but this time, when the Spatial Mirror flipped, the figure inside stopped running and even looked up at the sky.</p><p>His gaze seemed to pierce through space and landed on Ye Xiaotian, who was peeking at him!</p><p>“Close!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s hand trembled and he immediately turned off the screen.</p><p>“Damnit!”</p><p>“Demi-Saint!”</p><p>“A Demi-Saint had come to the Abyss Island?”</p><p>“Fortunately, I was fast enough and closed the screen on time. Otherwise, there would be a big disaster!”</p><p>“Cloud Attribute? Yunlun Mountain Range… who could it be?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was deep in thought, but he dared not think any further.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“Everyone’s running toward the forest. Is that the Forest of Miracles?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian frowned.</p><p>The three consecutive images were all related to the forest, and there were also rumbling sounds. He could not help but suspect that this was not a coincidence, but a certainty.</p><p>He waved his hand again.</p><p>This time, Ye Xiaotian saw the source of the rumbling.</p><p>A shirtless man ran and held a fruit the size of a human head in his arms. Behind him was a black Void Attendant that was three thousand feet tall.</p><p>“Ha!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian chuckled.</p><p>This burly man was also one unlucky fellow.</p><p>However, this unlucky fellow was still a little lucky. There was only one Void Attendant in the Forest of Miracles chasing after him.</p><p>The First Hall of Sins…</p><p>Turning around to look at the Great Hall, Ye Xiaotian heaved a long sigh of relief before he managed to suppress his throbbing heartbeat.</p><p>He didn’t want to experience the feeling of meeting the Void Attendant in the corner again.</p><p>The First Hall of Sins was not a place for humans. If he didn’t have the Spatial Upanishad, he wouldn’t have been able to walk out of it alive.</p><p>“Demi-Saint?”</p><p>Even Demi-Saints with weak escape abilities would be killed by the countless Void Attendants!</p><p>With that thought in mind, Ye Xiaotian swiped his hand again, and the Spatial Mirror changed.</p><p>In the next second, his face stiffened as if he had been frozen in time. He could not come back to his senses for a long time.</p><p>“I think I know why everyone is rushing to the Forest of Miracles.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian mumbled to himself. A red light flashed in his arms, and the iron ball Aje raised his head.</p><p>“Ma Ma!”</p><p>On the screen was an enormous Herb Garden, and there was Xu Xiaoshou trying his best to open a Spatial Passageway and attempting to swallow everything up!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
