You also know that Teng Shanhai…can not die!”</p><p>“But you also know that if he doesn’t die, I’ll die!”</p><p>The Holy Light of Saints exerted even more force. Jiang Buyi went crazy and stopped giving any regard to Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>“Your Holy Divine Palace is a righteous and protective organization. However, have they ever thought about me?”</p><p>“Don’t force me…”</p><p>Jiang Buyi shook his head with a demonic look in his eyes, “This Saint doesn’t want to kill you!”</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>Under the strong pressure of the Holy Light of Saints, Rao Yaoyao spurted out blood like a waterfall. Her whole body cracked, but she was still struggling to hold on. “I guarantee that as long as he lives, he won’t be able to hurt you or the Northern Region’s Jiang clan in the future.”</p><p>“What’s the use of your guarantee!” Jiang Buyi roared.</p><p>Who was he?</p><p>If he believed these one-sided words, how could he have grown to become a demi-saint in the hostile environment of the Northern Region?</p><p>The naive and pitiful ones had long since been wiped out by the great waves, leaving behind spiritual cultivators who had grown up on the bones of tens of thousands of people. Who would dare to take any chances?</p><p>Teng Shanhai must die!</p><p>Even if the king of heavens was to come, they would not be able to save him!</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi used more strength and sent Rao Yaoyao, who finally couldn’t hold on, flying.</p><p>His control of the Holy Light of Saint’s power was extremely precise. It only managed to push back Rao Yaoyao, and the remaining power of evil extermination was poured onto the little bit of Teng Shanhai’s blood that Rao Yaoyao wanted to protect.</p><p>“Sizzle~”</p><p>The sound of evaporation and fading.</p><p>Being able to rebirth and resurrect from a drop of blood seemed like a dream to mortals. On Jiang Buyi’s path of growth, he used this method to escape death countless times.</p><p>If he could do it, the Holy Divine Palace naturally could do it too!</p><p>Therefore, Jiang Buyi knew that Teng Shanhai’s flesh and blood must not be left behind. Not only that, the fragments of his soul, his spiritual will, and even the slightest trace of his existence in this world must be destroyed.</p><p>After that, Jiang Buyi would use his demi-saint’s will to completely erase him!</p><p>What he was most afraid of was not that he was soft-hearted, but that after he had used all his strength, the enemy was still alive. Years later, he wouldn’t know if Teng Shanhai had resurrected and had been hiding in the dark. Finally, after he had cultivated successfully, he would return to seek revenge.</p><p>This was the most despairing thing.</p><p>Jiang Buyi did not want his future self to be in a deadlock.</p><p>Perhaps the quality of the Holy Light of Saints would not be comparable to the matured power of the Demon God.</p><p>However, the power of the Demon God controlled by a higher void could not even be unleashed to one-ten-thousandth of its power. The Holy Light of Saints was the best solution at the moment.</p><p>Teng Shanhai, who had been turned into minced meat, was completely unable to fight back. He could only allow his traces in this world to slowly disappear.</p><p>“Purify.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi announced softly. Holy Light rose in the Holy Realm and everything was cleared into nothingness.</p><p>Soul, body, will, and hope…</p><p>Teng Shanhai had been completely exterminated!</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>In the deep pit, Rao Yaoyao propped herself up with her sword, barely managing to prop herself up. Seeing this scene, her delicate body trembled.</p><p>Teng Shanhai was dead.</p><p>In front of her eyes, Jiang Buyi did not show any mercy and completely wiped out Teng Shanhai.</p><p>Looking back at the battlefield, other than the shambles, there was no trace of blood left by Teng Shanhai.</p><p>Under the Holy Realm, the higher void had nowhere to hide.</p><p>All of Teng Shanhai’s hidden moves that could turn the tables were crushed and obliterated.</p><p>“Jiang Buyi…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao pulled out Cang Godhood Sword and murmured in disbelief.</p><p>She flew out of the deep pit and landed in front of Jiang Buyi. She shook her head gently and sighed, “You don’t want to know the consequences of killing Teng Shanhai. You can’t afford to bear the consequences.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi stared at the woman in front of him silently.</p><p>Teng Shanhai was already dead, what could the Holy Divine Palace do to him?</p><p>To fight a demi-saint for a dead man?</p><p>“My condolences,” He closed his eyes.</p><p>“Ha!” Rao Yaoyao was so angry that she laughed. She dragged her sword and turned to leave. “Jiang Buyi, I can only say that…You have been used by someone as their weapon!”</p><p>Until his death, Teng Shanhai still believed that Jiang Buyi, who killed him, was transformed by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>There was definitely a reason for this!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was thinking that perhaps something had already happened here before she and Jiang Buyi arrived.</p><p>Teng Shanhai must have met Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He had indeed recovered his Xiao Divine Spear from the other party and had also heard what that “Jiang Buyi” had said in the tone of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>As such, Teng Shanhai was sure that Jiang Buyi, who had killed him, had always been Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Unfortunately, the dead can’t open their mouths.</p><p>The real demi-saint Jiang Buyi did not give him a chance at all. He did not even clarify anything before killing him.</p><p>Was Jiang Buyi stupid?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was well aware that if their position was swapped, she would also make the same choice.</p><p>If she had offended someone and was certain that this person would become very strong in the future, she could only kill them to prevent revenge!</p><p>This had nothing to do with ‘stupidity’. It could only be said that the situation forced him to.</p><p>Moreover, the person who used the scheme was too brilliant!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“Hehe, ha, hahahahahaha!”</p><p>The sound of footsteps echoed Rao Yaoyao’s laugh, which was gradually turning bleak.</p><p>The voice went far away.</p><p>Jiang Buyi, who had remained in his original spot, had his eyes tightly shut.</p><p>He broke his promise.</p><p>Originally, he had wanted to leave one head and bring it to the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe to question Dao Qiongcang. However, now, Jiang Buyi did not dare to give Teng Shanhai any chance.</p><p>“Used as a weapon?”</p><p>“By Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>How could Jiang Buyi not know that he might have been used by the junior, Xu Xiaoshou, whom he had never met before?</p><p>However, Teng Shanhai was unbearable!</p><p>That mouth of his was full of vulgarities.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
