It raised its head abruptly and stared straight at its demonic owner.</p><p>“Weng!”</p><p>The three gray petals in its left eye turned, and the air seemed to have stagnated.</p><p>In the next second, Xu Xiaoshou’s movements stopped, and his expression became dull. His eyes seemed to have lost their spirit and he subconsciously and intermittently said, “Meow… meow… meow…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er: “? ? ? ?”</p><p>She was shocked again. This time, it was because of Greedy the Cat Spirit.</p><p>“In order not to eat the Elixir, he even used the Three Loathsome Eyes on his owner?”</p><p>“You’re really something… Pei, you’re really something!”</p><p>After being controlled for only an instant, Xu Xiaoshou mimicked the cat’s meow and quickly retracted his hand. He took out the Saint Refining Pill that was about to fall into Greedy the Cat Spirit’s mouth and was about to swallow it himself.</p><p>“Controlled, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>At this moment, his Spiritual Awakening was triggered.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou regained consciousness and in the next second, he was furious.</p><p>“Unfilial son, how dare you trick me! Who did you learn your bad habits from?”</p><p>“Meow Meow Meow…”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit was terrified and quickly explained. “It was all Hidden Bitter, it was all Hidden Bitter…”</p><p>While Greedy the Cat Spirit was busy explaining and gesticulating with its paws, Xu Xiaoshou quickly stuffed the Saint Refining Pill into the little white cat’s throat.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit’s eyes popped out: “? ? ?”</p><p>“Gulp!”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit swallowed subconsciously, and after it swallowed, its tears flowed out.</p><p>“Meow…”</p><p>“What.”</p><p>“How could he be shameless?”</p><p>“I was still talking, I was still talking…”</p><p>“It’ll be fine. I did not lie to you. It won’t hurt, Ha.” Xu Xiaoshou became gentle and stroked the cat’s head to comfort it.</p><p>“Meow.” Greedy the Cat Spirit wanted to exert its strength..</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately saw through the signs and frowned. “You’re not allowed to use your swallowing skills! Have a proper taste of the fourth-grade Elixirs. They’re very delicious.”</p><p>He still had to test whether the Elixir would cause one’s death.</p><p>If Greedy the Cat Spirit used his swallowing skill to turn it into energy, then what was the point of feeding it?</p><p>“Meow…”</p><p>This time, Greedy the Cat Spirit gave up struggling.</p><p>Since he swallowed it, then he would have to live with it.</p><p>He didn’t believe in the owner’s Conducting Alchemy ability, but he still had the ability to save a cat.</p><p>Perhaps before he died later, he could get a taste of ‘Holy Blood’ and ‘God’s Blessing’. Greedy the Cat Spirit had been craving for these two mouthfuls for a long time.</p><p>“How is it?” Xu Xiaoshou asked, full of concern about the Cat Spirit’s condition.</p><p>“Meow…”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit was powerless to reply.</p><p>The taste in its mouth was bitter. It was obviously the taste of the Elixir ashes. “This was nothing compared to the Elixirs that I refined.”</p><p>However, after a short while, all the ashes were digested. A rich fragrance bloomed in its mouth and stomach, which revealed the core medicinal effect of the Saint Refining Pill as a fourth-grade Elixir.</p><p>“Wu Wu Wu…”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit’s body instantly twitched. His four short legs kicked forward and extended backward. Even its tail was as straight as a spear. This time, he really turned into a ‘Cat’!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was flustered.</p><p>“Was it dead?”</p><p>“No…”</p><p>“Why did it seem similar to Xu Xiaoshou’s drug addiction condition?”</p><p>“Meow”</p><p>After a long period of convulsions, Greedy the Cat Spirit finally recovered from the euphoric state it was in.</p><p>“Meow Meow Meow…”</p><p>It waved its claws to describe the feeling.</p><p>“There was the smell of ‘Heart Clearing Fruit’, the smell of “Good Wood Root’, the smell of ‘Spiritual Flowers’, and…hmm? How could there be a low-grade ingredient like ‘Catnip’, which was not a Spiritual Medicine? Were these Spiritual Ingredients?”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit was suddenly stunned. Its little head was filled with uncertainties and then it reacted.</p><p>“Dammit!, these two pills were not made purely by accident, right?”</p><p>“What did it say?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er could not understand cat language, so she could only look at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>When he saw that the cat was not dead, Xu Xiaoshou immediately felt relieved. He patted the soft belly of the cat and said with a smile, “It said it was delicious. It has never eaten such delicious Elixirs. The medicinal properties are also good, so it should be a top-grade Elixir.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er: “? ? ?”</p><p>“Suspected, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“You said that’s what it said, was that really what Greedy the Cat Spirit wanted to say?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
