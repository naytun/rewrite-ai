Even if her personality had changed a little, the bond between the two of them could not be easily ended.</p><p>However, it was clear that Xu Xiaoshou knew that his current strength was not enough to defend the Lei family from all their mistakes.</p><p>Lei Xi’er was right about one thing.</p><p>He had indeed emptied the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, but a void attendant was enough for him to die on Abyss Island.</p><p>Moreover, the huge Abyss Island was a prison used by Holy Divine Palace and the five Holy Emperor Aristocratic Families to imprison demi-saints and Holy Emperors.</p><p>The difference between the two sides were incredibly huge!</p><p>Fortunately, this difference was not irreparable.</p><p>“It’s only a matter of time…”</p><p>In the past, Xu Xiaoshou had been short of time. He knew his cultivation state and that resources could be exchanged for time.</p><p>However, he also lacked resources and the time to find resources, thus forming a vicious cycle.</p><p>It was different now.</p><p>This Herb Garden of Divine Farmer could help Xu Xiaoshou grow quickly, allowing him to gain more time to cultivate compared to the Bone Ash Ranked seniors.</p><p>“Although I’m at the master stage now, there’s almost no bottleneck before I break through to the Sovereign realm.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned to look at the herb garden, his heart full of enthusiasm.</p><p>Those in the Master stage, Sovereign stage, and the Higher void level would gather the Way of the Heavens into one’s body to reach the Holy path. This was the path of promotion for ordinary people.</p><p>He was different.</p><p>At his current stage as a master, he had already entered the Dao realm that only Sovereign experts could have.</p><p>The Way of the Sword, the Way of fire-type Spiritual Cultivation, the way of spiritual array, Divine Secrets, Weaving, and even body tempering. It could be said that Xu Xiao’s comprehension of the various great paths was different from ordinary masters and was comparable to Sovereigns.</p><p>Breakthrough?</p><p>I only need to “eat” you!</p><p>“Pluck.”</p><p>After picking a Holy Miracle Fruit, Xu Xiaoshou first threw it to Lei Xi’er.</p><p>“Do you still have the Saint Refining Pill I gave you? Greedy the Cat Spirit has already tested the pill, and in theory, there should be no problem. We’re short of time now, so hurry up and eat it.”</p><p>He didn’t know how crazy the void attendants would be now that the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer had been emptied.</p><p>However, the Yuan Mansion was independent of the world of Abyss island, so it was unlikely that the void attendants would be able to find him.</p><p>Since that was the case, he should take advantage of the time to quickly grow before the void attendants went crazy!</p><p>Who knew if his ability to escape would greatly increase after that?</p><p>With that in mind, Xu Xiaoshou picked another Holy Miracle Fruit for himself.</p><p>The rich medicinal fragrance was refreshing. Before swallowing it, Xu Xiaoshou, who was already close to the perfection of his master stage, once again felt the faint strength of a breakthrough when he first entered the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>“Is this the treasure that Double Dumba*s and Hong Dang risked their lives to obtain?”</p><p>The Holy Miracle Fruit was the size of a human head. If one looked closely, one could see a large number of mysterious Saint runes gathered in it, and it gave off an alluring fragrance.</p><p>For such a treasure, he had a herb garden.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt like he was in a dream.</p><p>On the side, Lei Xi’er caught the Holy Miracle Fruit that was casually thrown to her. Then, she glanced at the Dragon Apricot that was emitting a bright golden light behind her. The corners of her mouth could not help but reveal a playful smile as she said, ”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, did you forget to look around for other treasures in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer? Are there any other treasures that are better than this fruit?”</p><p>(Teased. Passive value +1.)</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked up hesitantly, “Treasure? Other than the Holy Miracle Fruit, what other treasures are there?”</p><p>The corners of Lei Xi’er’s lips curved, but she held back her smile. She turned her head to look at the Dragon Apricot behind her. “Here, this is it.”</p><p>She didn’t believe that Xu Xiaoshou really didn’t notice the Dragon Apricot, one of the Nine Great Ancestral Trees!</p><p>This tree was clearly emitting such a dazzling golden light, so resplendent and dazzling.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes finally moved away from Lei Xi’er’s face and looked at the other “treasures” in the herb garden except for the Holy Miracle Fruit in the cognitive world.</p><p>“Dragon Apricot! One of the Nine Great Ancestral Trees, the main body!” Lei Xi’er’s tone was no longer calm.</p><p>In fact, she didn’t need to say anything. With just one look, Xu Xiaoshou already had all the information about Dragon Apricot in his mind.</p><p>“Dragon Apricot, an apricot tree that bears fruit every three thousand years.”</p><p>A Dragon apricot is sweet, and the flesh is refreshing. It can strengthen one’s body. If one consumed 99 Dragon apricots, they can obtain the power of the Dragon ancestor.</p><p>“Using dragon blood to water the Dragon apricot can shorten the time it takes for the Dragon apricot tree to bear fruit.”</p><p>“These are some of the uses of the Dragon apricot. It can be used to make true Dragon Bone soup, Dragon Blood Powder, a feast of all Dragons, juice and blood to make the ‘Golden Red Dragon drink’, and dessert after meals…”</p><p>A dazzling amount of information appeared in Xu Xiaoshou’s mind after he glanced at the tree of Dragon Apricot.</p><p>Xu xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>What?</p><p>One of the Nine Great Ancestral Trees, the Dragon Apricot…was in his Yuan Mansion?</p><p>“Is this true?”</p><p>Xu xiaoshou immediately put down the fruit of the Holy miracle. His eyes widened, and he walked towards long Xing in disbelief. He reached out, wanting to touch this dream-like existence.</p><p>In his Yuan Mansion, he still had the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch and the Bodhi Root!</p><p>However, the effectiveness of these two items currently seemed to not even be comparable to a single Dragon apricot!</p><p>Although the introduction of Dragon Apricot in ” cooking proficiency” was very strange, Xu Xiaoshou could catch the key points in a short time.</p><p>“Body strengthening!”</p><p>Even if it was just a rough summary of words, Xu Xiaoshou could see the shocking effect of these simple words.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
