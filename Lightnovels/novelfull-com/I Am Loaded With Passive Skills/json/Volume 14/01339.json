At the same time, he maintained a friendly distance between his clothes and his sensitive muscles so that they would no longer rub against each other.</p><p>Now, he finally had some free time to take a good look at the effects of the Holy Miracle Fruit.</p><p>“What realm am I at?”</p><p>After eating the Holy Miracle Fruit, Xu Xiaoshou’s body bounced back and forth between the sky and the ground, he didn’t even know when he had broken through.</p><p>Logically speaking, the path principle comprehension brought about by a grandmaster’s breakthrough should be quite great.</p><p>Unfortunately, these path principle comprehensions paled in comparison to the pleasure presented by the ‘Holy miracle Fruit’ and the ‘Breathing Technique’.</p><p>“The path is intangible. If it is divided into yin and yang, it becomes right and wrong, one and two, a circle and a square, with squares and edges, shape and corners.”</p><p>“To determine black and white, to prove heaven and earth, to remember the past and the future, to judge the disharmony of time and space.”</p><p>“They are called water and fire, metal and wood, wind and thunder, light and darkness.</p><p>“It can be said that all the contradictions in the world come from the heart, and the world is forever defined!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The path principle comprehension that came late was not washed away by the pleasure. It only settled in the depths of his mind.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou was enlightened by the path principle comprehension. He immediately understood that he had broken through to the Yin Yang State of the master stage and entered the Way of the Heavens.</p><p>Yin Yang State of the master stage was based on one’s heart. One could observe the Way of the Heavens and use it to lay the foundation for one’s future path.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou could find similar comprehensions in the sword technique expertise of the sovereign level.</p><p>The 3,000 Way of Sword encompassed everything.</p><p>This was not any weaker than the Way of Spiritual Cultivation, and it was the mainstream of the previous era.</p><p>Therefore, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had only relived his knowledge of the Way of the Heavens. In other words, he had switched from the perspective of observing the Way of the Heavens from the Way of the Sword to the perspective of the Way of Spiritual Cultivation.</p><p>Review the old to learn the new.</p><p>When he opened his eyes again, there was still nothing in front of him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt like he could see the rules of the world.</p><p>One by one, they formed the order of the Heavens, just like the Divine Path Principles that Yu Zhiwen could see with his divine secret ability in the White Cave.</p><p>“So if this ability is further evolved, it’ll be similar to the state of being able to contain the Way of the Heavens and Unity of Man and the Heavens?” Xu Xiaoshou said thoughtfully.</p><p>Using his mind to observe his energy reserve.</p><p>At this moment, his energy reserve had been expanded greatly, like a vast ocean.</p><p>Heavenly Image State allowed his energy reserve to have all the phenomena of the world. It could produce all kinds of illusions such as tides, storms, and tsunamis. It did not have any actual offensive effect, but it had the preliminary form of the world in his energy center.</p><p>The Yin Yang state, on the other hand, made the world in Xu Xiaoshou’s energy center more vivid with the Way of the Heavens, rules, day and night, right and wrong.</p><p>However, it still didn’t have any substantial effect.</p><p>In the end, Grandmaster was just laying the foundation for the Sovereign realm and the explosive power of one’s abilities after the Cutting Path stage.</p><p>During this period, the stronger one’s path principle comprehension was, the higher the chances of a Sovereign realm comprehending the Upanishad of spiritual cultivation. After the Cutting Path Stage, one’s battle prowess would be even more terrifying.</p><p>However, from a Grandmaster’s perspective, the most practical effect of each breakthrough was only a huge change in the quality and quantity of the spiritual source.</p><p>That was all.</p><p>“I’ve become stronger again, but not by much.”</p><p>Of course, this was only in comparison to the Sovereigns and Cutting Paths.</p><p>Looking at his energy reserve being expanded by more than ten times, Xu Xiaoshou clearly felt that his energy reserve at this level was not inferior to a Sovereign. He might not even be inferior to a Cutting Path.</p><p>In the past, he had to measure the range and the number of times to use ‘take the easy way out’, and take into account ‘Eternal Vitality’, ‘High Spirits’, ‘transformation’, and so on.</p><p>Now, however, it seemed that there was no longer a need?</p><p>Unless it was an exaggerated space teleportation that crossed a county and a world, his energy reserve would probably not be exhausted.</p><p>This was obviously not the increase in the spiritual source that a Grandmaster Yin Yang state could bring.</p><p>“Only the Yin Yang state?” Xu Xiaoshou frowned.</p><p>The biggest disadvantage of using the Holy Miracle Fruit to break through was that he could not suppress his realm and he did not know how many rounds he had broken through just now.</p><p>He was already at the peak of celestial cultivation. If a Holy Miracle Fruit could only help him break through to the Yin Yang state, Xu Xiaoshou could not believe it.</p><p>“Starlight…”</p><p>Upon closer inspection, above the energy reserve, not only were there the phenomena of the heavens and earth, the Way of the Heavens of Yin and Yang, but there were also speckles of Starlight that were not eye-catching.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally understood.</p><p>He searched his memory again, and as expected, he found another Way of Heaven’s comprehension that had been washed away by the pleasure.</p><p>Damn it, he hid it so deeply. Was it he who was breaking through, or was it someone else? how did he break through without even knowing?</p><p>He picked it up and started reading.</p><p>“The stars in the Nine Heavens, divined as unknown, struck with one’s heart, illuminating the vast universe…”</p><p>“Three thousand worlds, found with spirit, up and down, all four directions, from ancient times to present, glorious…”</p><p>“The realm of energy reserve, the myriad of stars, the universe, the universe, destroy the stars to obtain…”</p><p>The decadent Taoist music flowed in his ears.</p><p>After a short pause, Xu Xiaoshou recovered from the state of enlightenment.</p><p>“Star Worship State!”</p><p>“So it turns out that I’m already at the Star Worship State…”</p><p>If one was to say that the path comprehended by astronomical phenomena and Yin and Yang was based on the embryonic form of the world in the energy center, then one would be able to form an illusory divine kingdom in one’s heart.</p><p>Then the star seminary drew upon the power of the Nine Heavenly stars.</p><p>Up and down, the four directions were the universe, and the past and present were the universes.</p><p>This could be explained as the world of his divine kingdom had taken a preliminary form when it broke through to the Star Worship State. It was determined to be the foundation for the future ‘bounded domain’ and the ‘Higher Void World’.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
