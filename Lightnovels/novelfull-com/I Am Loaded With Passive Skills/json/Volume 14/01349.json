After Xu Xiaoshou made a serious comparison, he came to the conclusion that there was indeed a 90% chance of survival.</p><p>At the very least, the heartbeat of the Holy Emperor Dragon’s Scale this time was not as exaggerated as when he came face-to-face with a Saint.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already regarded his encounter with the Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi in the Deep Sea World as a mortal warning from the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale.</p><p>And when he faced that kind of situation, he could still escape from the tiger’s mouth.</p><p>In other words, the frantic sounds of the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale’s heartbeats, which were weaker than when he faced the Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi, basically meant that the danger this time should be manageable and he was not doomed for death.</p><p>And such ‘danger’ was equivalent to ‘opportunity’.</p><p>In other words, it was another treasure that could be ‘taken when he used his brain’ and ‘fought for when he used his hands’!</p><p>As long as nothing untoward happened, there were no ‘what if’s’. One should know that God’s plan superseded one’s own.</p><p>“I haven’t offended anyone on the Abyss Island, so the warning from the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale should most likely be about the Void Attendant.</p><p>“But it’s been a day, and I didn’t show my face when I stole the medicine. The Void Attendant can’t possibly remember me.”</p><p>“Why is it that as long as I want to return to the Abyss Island, the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale’s heartbeat will accelerate?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought about this seriously.</p><p>Since it was a matter of life and death, he had no choice but to use his brain to analyze the situation.</p><p>“How can a 1000-meter-tall, simple-minded giant with well-developed limbs who doesn’t know who I am, locate me and destroy me as soon as I want to return to the Abyss Island? Is that why the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale’s heartbeat accelerated in such a way?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his chin and thought of the Double Dumba*s and his brother Hong Dang.</p><p>Both of them had died in the same manner-they were chased to death while they held the Holy Miracle Fruit in their arms.</p><p>From the behavior of the Void Attendant, who chased after the Double Dumba*s instead of himself and Lei Xi ‘er, the two Abyss Island sinners, it was evident that the Void Attendant would not kill the innocent.</p><p>From the Void Attendant’s actions, when he did not even see Lei Xi ‘er, who hid outside the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, when it chased after Hong Dang, it could be seen that the big fellow’s eyes were only focused on the Spiritual Medicine in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer and not on humans.</p><p>“After all, if I were the Void Attendant…”</p><p>“Human beings?”</p><p>“They were just ants, nothing worth mentioning!”</p><p>“So…”</p><p>“Is it related to the ‘medicine’?”</p><p>The Void Attendant doesn’t target people or anything else. Its mission is only to ‘protect the Spiritual Medicine’, and its accompanying mission is naturally to’ eliminate the Medicine thieves’? ”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had found the only true solution.</p><p>He went along with the answer.</p><p>“In that case, it’s impossible for the Void Attendant to recognize me when I return to the Abyss Island, so it’s impossible for him to find me. That’s why the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale’s heartbeat would not accelerate so rapidly”.</p><p>“However, its heartbeat had accelerated after all. This means that once I return to the Abyss Island, the Void Attendant will definitely look for me!”</p><p>“It’s so stupid, how can it look for anyone?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his chin with his fingers and turned to look at the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer. He squinted and smelled the refreshing fragrance of the Spiritual Medicine. A spiritual light flashed in his mind.</p><p>“The smell of Medicine!”</p><p>He executed a ‘highfive’ and his expression became excited.</p><p>“That’s right, it’s the medicinal fragrance!”</p><p>“No matter how a person hides or disguises himself, he can’t hide or fake his smell.”</p><p>“Both Brother Hong Dang and Brother Double Dumba*s had plucked the Holy Miracle Fruit and were stained with the aura of the Holy Medicine. No matter how they ran, they could not escape from the Void Attendant.”</p><p>“I’ve emptied the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer. The Void Attendant can’t locate me in the Yuan Mansion, but once I return to the Abyss Island, I’ll be afraid.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clenched his fists and his expression became excited.</p><p>“With the Void Attendant’s nose that protected the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer all year round, it should be easy for him to figure out that I’m the herb thief through my smell.”</p><p>“No matter how many layers of camouflage I put on!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was sure that the answer was pretty close.</p><p>When it came to the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, the Void Attendant had fallen for his little trick of ‘luring the tiger away from the mountain’ without even the most basic resistance. From this, it could be seen that the Giant was really brainless.</p><p>And for a brainless giant to find someone, it would definitely use the most direct and simplest method.</p><p>It was too complicated. For example, after the communication through the Abyss island’s laws, Spatio-temporal Retrospect, and fiery golden eyes, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had overestimated the Void Attendant.</p><p>The strong were bound to have shortcomings.</p><p>The Void Attendant’s physical body was already so strong. There was no reason for him to master the Space-time Attribute and his Path Principle Comprehension was comparable to that of a Demi-Saint.</p><p>In that case, its intelligence would definitely not be simple!</p><p>This meant that it would definitely not just be a Void Attendant, but a ‘Superman’ who had mastered self-awareness s and should have learned to resist the rules and pursue freedom.</p><p>Just like the First-in-command Saint Servant Bazhun’an.</p><p>Just like Dao Qiongcang, the master the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>With ‘strength’ and ‘wisdom’ co-existing, no one would choose to be controlled-that was where the word ‘foolish’ came from.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought about this and understood that the Void Attendant might have searched for people basically through ‘simple smells’. Not only was he not discouraged, but he also became more excited.</p><p>“I probably can’t get rid of the smell, no matter how I disguise it.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
