Inhumane Bai Lian! (1)</p><p>“I knew it, I knew it…”</p><p>Situ Yongren, who had been apprehended by the secondary plane door and stuck in the void, had a lack luster look in his eyes. He had lost his former glory of being ranked first on the Path Division’s heavenly list.</p><p>It took a lot of effort to survive from Xu Xiaoshou’s sword, and for that, he had to sacrifice the Divine Oracle.</p><p>He had encountered Bazhun’an and Mei Siren, but was disregarded by the ancient swordsman who was known for his virtue and principles. No matter what, he had at least kept his life.</p><p>However…</p><p>He could avoid it the first time round, but he could not avoid it for the fifteenth time.</p><p>When the power of the secondary plane door erupted in his body, Situ Yongren did not even have the slightest ability to resist.</p><p>He hated it!</p><p>He hated himself because he swallowed the golden water droplet that Yu Lingdi had given him back at the ruins of the First Hall of Sins!</p><p>“You said that you would leave a backup plan to save my life…”</p><p>At that time, Yu Lingdi was so arrogant and his look said, “I don’t want to save you, and I look down on you. However, since we’re on the same side, I’ll have to give you a card.”</p><p>He didn’t even force him to swallow the golden water droplet. He only spoke to him in a veiled sarcastic manner. Situ Yongren then dazedly drank the poison as if it was a treasure.</p><p>How could he remove the phantom secondary plane door that had fused into his blood?</p><p>This was clearly a trap set by Water Ghost that he was not aware of.</p><p>Now that he thought about it, everything was so ridiculous. He felt like a fool who was being played by others.</p><p>What was the difference between Water Ghost’s tactics – to retreat in order to advance and how he played hard to get, and how he used words to get him to die in the Fallen Abyss?</p><p>Apparently, the same trick had been used twice and he had not noticed it before.</p><p>“To think that I assumed that all the seniors were as proud as Supreme Master and disdained to attack like Bazhun’an…”</p><p>Situ Yongren wanted to cry.</p><p>After being ignored by Bazhun’an, he had been angry, but also glad.</p><p>When he thought about it…</p><p>Ha!</p><p>They are them, I am Bazhun’an.</p><p>These words were not wrong. There was only one Bazhun’an.</p><p>For Water Ghost and the others, when they used juniors as hostages in a battle between their peers, they were even more narrow-minded than the eyes of needles!</p><p>Unlike Situ Yongren, who was in despair above the Forest of Miracles, Bai Lian had ensconced himself comfortably in the boiling lava of the Desolate Inferno Domain.</p><p>Ever since he failed to dissuade his Supreme Master Mu Ling, the latter had insisted on going to the battlefield.</p><p>Bai Lian thought for a moment. If he went over, it would not make much of a difference. It would also easily cause the Holy Palace to lose its balance and be dragged into the big picture.</p><p>Therefore, even though he felt anxious and nervous, Bai Lian mentally adjusted his thoughts due to his status.</p><p>He obediently listened to his Supreme Master’s words and returned to the Desolate Inferno Domain. He took off his clothes and soaked in the lava again.</p><p>“I’m a little nervous, but I’m also really comfortable…”</p><p>However this sort of bliss did not last long.</p><p>As the battle continued, the battlefield suddenly expanded from the small Fallen Abyss to the entire Abyss Island.</p><p>Bai Lian who was immersed in the lava, was caught off guard and had his spiritual source sealed by the Spell Forbidden Barrier. He was almost reduced to ashes by the high temperature of the Desolate Inferno Domain.</p><p>After he relied on his physical body to barely withstand the heat for a while, he was trapped in the water ball again, and his spiritual source flowed out crazily.</p><p>Water and fire were a great contrast, life was extremely painful!</p><p>The joy of taking a bath… If he had known earlier, he would not have indulged in such bliss!</p><p>But if that was all, then it was fine.</p><p>This bit of pain was nothing to the descendants of the Infernal lineage.</p><p>However…</p><p>Even when people are at home, misfortune came from Heaven, the ancients really do did not lie!</p><p>Before Bai Lian could retaliate, the water ball disappeared.</p><p>Just as he relaxed, the main character of the battlefield, Water Ghost, flashed above the Desolate Inferno Domain under Dao Qiongcang’s gaze.</p><p>It was coincidentally right above where he soaked in the bath and wanted to undergo sanctification.</p><p>“What are you doing!”</p><p>Bai Lian was scared out of his wits and could not continue with his bath anymore. He popped his head out and cursed as he ran off.</p><p>When it came to the saint calamity, being in such proximity was no different from waiting for death.</p><p>However, he realized that he was naked and he was one of the five great authorities of the Holy Palace. And everyone on the battlefield was about to look over…</p><p>In this world, there was something more important than life.</p><p>Dignity!</p><p>Bai Lian had already dashed off halfway when he hurriedly went back to grab his clothes and put them on. In his heart, he cursed his Supreme Master for being such a wily old fox who was well aware of the situation. He was simply a prophet.</p><p>He had not seen his Supreme Master on the battlefield before, but he had left the Desolate Inferno Domain long ago in a great hurry. It was as if he had known in advance that the Desolate Inferno Domain would become the main battlefield.</p><p>Bai Lian couldn’t care less if this was a coincidence or part of Water Ghost’s scheme.</p><p>As one of the five great authorities of the Holy Palace, he was much smarter than ordinary people. He knew that there was a greater danger than to lose his life and dignity. At the same time, he followed Water Ghost here.</p><p>Therefore, even though he panicked, Bai Lian’s thoughts were unusually clear. As he ran, he shouted.</p><p>“Water Ghost, I have no enmity with you in the past or in the present, so why did you set me up?”</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao, the Holy Palace’s stance is clear. I went to the Yunlun Mountain Range to carry out some inspection and was accidentally swept into the Lone Cliff and fell into the deep sea and Abyss Island. I also inadvertently took a bath in the Desolate Inferno Domain… Pei, it was just for cultivation, I definitely had no intention to collude with the Saint Servant!”</p><p>He spoke very quickly, and in just a few words, he had completely removed his involvement with the Holy Palace and the battle. He did not even dare to wait for Dao Qiongcang to appear and ask questions, or for Water Ghost to speak first.</p><p>If Water Ghost spoke first, it would be difficult for Bai Lian to clear his name.</p><p>If Dao Qiongcang came over and saw Bai Lian here, he would most likely not ask any questions. Instead, he would take advantage of the situation and kill the people of the Infernal lineage first.</p><p>After all, he had a valid ‘reason’ – Bai Lian had colluded with the Saint Servant and there were witnesses.</p><p>–</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
