(3)</h1><p>Chapter 2127: How Dare You Provoke Me? Disrespecting Invincible? (3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Would Rao Yaoyao fall for it?</p><p>Thinking of this, Water Ghost almost laughed out loud.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was provoking Rao Yaoyao, how exciting!</p><p>Only Dao Qiongcang knew that Xu Xiaoshou was stepping on Rao Yaoyao’s minefield.</p><p>The background of “Rao” could be discussed behind her back, but who would dare to mention it in front of Rao Yaoyao?</p><p>Now, however, the circumstances were stronger than the person’s influence, it’s easy for those in authority to lose their positions!</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao, don’t be reckless…” Dao Qiongcang hurriedly said.</p><p>However, Water Ghost, who was in his body, interrupted him, “Xu Xiaoshou, you are acting like a scoundrel now. If it were me, I would beat you up too…”</p><p>However, before Dao Qiongcang and Water Ghost could finish their sentences, Xu Xiaoshou turned around and shouted coldly.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>“Insignificant individuals should watch their mouths instead of being noisy and behaving annoyingly. I…”</p><p>“Did I allow you to speak?”</p><p>Stepping on the sea of fire, Xu Xiaoshou flicked his finger and shot out a white Refined Fire Seed.</p><p>F*ck!</p><p>At that moment, Water Ghost almost couldn’t suppress his anger. He had wanted to leave the body and beat a certain someone up.</p><p>How annoying!</p><p>This attack more or less carried some personal grudges, right?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was also rendered speechless by this kid.</p><p>The power of this attack did not seem to be from a Sovereign Dao Realm expert. This attack was even more potent than a full-powered attack from a demi-saint.</p><p>The body that Water Ghost was using belonged to Dao Qiongcang, hence he didn’t dare to be lazy and quickly dodged.</p><p>The fire seed brushed past him, but it did not explode when it touched him.</p><p>Instead, it suddenly expanded as Xu Xiaoshou sneered. Its energy overflowed. Dao Qiongcang’s pupils constricted, and the divine Sinan spun on its own.</p><p>“Greater Teleportation!”</p><p>DUUIII’.</p><p>The Fire Seed beside him disappeared.</p><p>In the distant Fallen Abyss, a black hole that spanned thousands of miles was broken open. The destructive aura was released and everything was destroyed.</p><p>It was as if someone had grabbed the saint calamity and thrown it out. The area was almost completely destroyed. There was no stone or wood left intact.</p><p>The earth was shaking and dust was rolling.</p><p>Everyone looked at the huge mushroom cloud in the distance and felt their lips dry and their teeth trembling.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had really changed!</p><p>He really had the power to shatter a land of peril with a single strike!</p><p>“Are you crazy?” Before Dao Qiongcang could speak, Water Ghost’s furious voice sounded. “Are you planning to kill me as well…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou swept him a cold glance.</p><p>Water Ghost instantly stopped talking and Dao Qiongcang took half a step back.</p><p>“Cursed. Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Missed, Passive Points +2.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao looked in the direction of the Fallen Abyss with a shocked expression.</p><p>If she had repaired and stabilized her demi-saint person in that place instead of coming out from there…</p><p>With the frail body of an ancient sword cultivator, would this attack bury her in the Fallen Abyss?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao finally understood why Dao Qiongcang had reminded her, and she also finally understood why Xu Xiaoshou was so arrogant at the moment.</p><p>However, just right after she had the realization, Xu Xiaoshou’s disgusting voice came back.</p><p>“Since Rao Yaoyao is rather adorable, I will forgive your ignorance of power.”</p><p>“Now that you’ve seen the power of my finger, you should know that I’m invincible. If that’s the case, why don’t you scram from the Abyss Island?”</p><p>As soon as he said this, Rao Yaoyao’s eyelids twitched, her red lips twitched, and her hand that was holding the sword was trembling from overexertion.</p><p>Who taught him that!</p><p>Who did Xu Xiaoshou learn all this from?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had no strength left to ridicule Xu Xiaoshou’s pretentious words.</p><p>A furious sword slashed out in the air.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, if I don’t tear off your mouth today, I won’t be called Rao</p><p>Yaoyao!”</p><p>Royal Sword, Emperor’s Execution!</p><p>A pink sword light tore apart the sea of white flames and the black space, slashing toward Xu Xiaoshou’s head.</p><p>The power of this slash wasn’t perfectly restrained. Rao Yaoyao was so angry that her hands were unstable.</p><p>Just the Secular Sword’s Will alone was enough to cause the countless Spiritual Cultivators below to be in a daze as if they were being affected by the Secular Sword’s Will.</p><p>However, on the opposite side of the sea of fire, Xu Xiaoshou was only dazed for a moment. His Spirit Awakening was triggered and he came back to his senses.</p><p>With the Holy Emperor’s power, he could ignore the Secular Sword’s Will even without the Spirit Awakening.</p><p>In the past, he would have to rely on Master Siren, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, or the Divine Oracle to neutralize such an unsolvable demi-saint attack.</p><p>However, at this moment…</p><p>So slow!</p><p>So tiny!</p><p>It could be simply destroyed with a flick of his finger!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tilted his head.</p><p>The sound of the sword light whistling through the air brushed past his ears.</p><p>He raised his left hand and pinched it with his fingers. The pink sword light was easily caught by the 10 Sections of the Finger Sword covered in white flames!</p><p>The sea of fire shook and parted the path visible to the naked eye.</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators below looked up and saw that the sword light was unable to advance an inch from Xu Xiaoshou’s fingertips. The crowd immediately burst into an uproar.</p><p>“It’s over…”</p><p>Everyone’s hearts clenched.</p><p>Although they were worried about their own life, they were also worried about Xu Xiaoshou and Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>Under everyone’s gaze, Xu Xiaoshou exerted force on his two fingers.</p><p>With a bang, the sword light turned into energy and was burned to pieces by the white flame instantly.</p><p>He still maintained the posture of destroying the sword light with his fingers and did not move. However, the sleeves of his hands suddenly moved and flew in the wind like withered leaves.</p><p>Within the sleeves, the pair of cracked arms that were overflowing with fire withered inch by inch, charred black like charcoal, like rotten wood.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at Rao Yaoyao. His gaze turned cold, and an iced fruit appeared in his mouth.</p><p>As he spat out the meaningless iced fruit, an ice lotus suddenly bloomed under his feet. White flames burned from his back as his Holy Emperor’s power exploded into a pair of wings. The Flame Python also let out a shocking sword cry when he raised his hand.</p><p>“Adorable Rao, I gave you a chance, but how dare you provoke me? You are disrespecting the Invincible!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
