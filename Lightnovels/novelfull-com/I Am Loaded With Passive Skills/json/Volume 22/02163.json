Holy Emperors Emerge! (1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio     Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou verified once again and found that his perception had not gone wrong.</p><p>The last time he obtained the power of the Holy Emperor, the Desolate Inferno Domain, various treasures on himself, the Fallen Abyss, and the Dark Iron Sword on the Abyss Island were all just triggers.</p><p>Together, they formed a combination that opened a power channel leading to the Inner Island.</p><p>Even though it was fragile, the power of the Holy Emperor could still be drawn through it.</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou discovered the source of his power, and surprisingly, it had no connection to the Desolate Inferno Domain, Fallen Abyss, Abyss Island, or even the Si Wu Formation! It came from the Yuan Mansion!</p><p>“Crack—I’</p><p>The spatial passageway cracked open in front of him.</p><p>A majestic force surged out, pushing out a staggering figure.</p><p>It was a petite and cute girl, with twin ponytails, wearing a lovely light green fluffy skirt.</p><p>A panicking white kitten perched on her head while she held elixirs in one hand, a bowl in the other, and unused bandages hung from her wrist.</p><p>—Before coming out, she had been taking care of the wounded in the Yuan Mansion world.</p><p>“Mu Zixi?” Xu Xiaoshou was momentarily stunned.</p><p>In such a dangerous situation, how dare she run out, and how could she even manage to do so?</p><p>He did not open the passage to Yuan Mansion… Soon, Xu Xiaoshou noticed that something was off with his little junior sister.</p><p>The tremendous force was surging out from her!</p><p>She did not come out willingly; she was pushed out by the power of the Holy Emperor!</p><p>—The Abyss Island was not the trigger; the last time the power of the Holy Emperor appeared because Abyss Island was just a deception to Dao Qiongcang. The little junior sister was the real key?</p><p>But…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not understand. How could his little junior sister, who had no connection to the power of the Holy Emperor, become the key?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…” Mu Zixi was anxious.</p><p>As soon as she appeared, she immediately noticed her senior brother, who exuded an extraordinary aura but wore a pained expression. As she swept her eyes across the chaotic battlefield of Abyss Island, her gaze inadvertently captured a blurry figure in the distance.</p><p>What level of Spiritual Cultivator was this?</p><p>With just one glance, Mu Zixi almost had a mental breakdown. Fortunately, the power of the Holy Emperor protected her.</p><p>Demi-saint?</p><p>Or even above demi-saint?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s opponent had reached such a level? No wonder injured practitioners were being thrown into the Yuan Mansion one after another…</p><p>As the power filled her body, Mu Zixi looked around in confusion, not understanding what had happened to her.</p><p>She helplessly looked at her senior brother, seeking help.</p><p>Whenever she was puzzled, even in a perilous situation, as long as Xu Xiaoshou was there, everything would be fine.</p><p>“Mu Zixi, what are you doing?”</p><p>“My dear little darling, it’s not safe outside!”</p><p>At this moment, following some voices, a weakened Xiao Kongtong and a panic-stricken Zhu Yike emerged from the spatial passageway inside the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>When they appeared, they intended to pull back Mu Zixi, who was supposed to be assisting them but suddenly ran out of the Yuan Mansion by herself.</p><p>But as soon as they appeared, they also noticed something unusual about Mu Zixi’s Holy Emperor’s power.</p><p>The devastated surroundings, scattered Holy Power, and the figure with solid form but blurry features all left Xiao Kongtong and Zhu Yike dumbfounded.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong paused, caught a glimpse of Wangze Holy Emperor, and almost retreated into the Yuan Mansion. He stopped in time and gave Xu Xiaoshou a puzzled look.</p><p>Zhu Yike was even more bewildered, his wide-open mouth unable to close.</p><p>Saint, Holy Emperor?</p><p>Wasn’t Lord Shou supposed to be fighting with the likes of Yu Lingdi? Wasn’t his opponent supposed to be at the Cutting Path Stage?</p><p>How did Lord Shou end up confronting the Holy Emperor?</p><p>“Snap!” Zhu Yike slapped himself in the face and swiftly retreated into the Yuan Mansion world.</p><p>Good heavens! He saw Lord Shou fighting the Holy Emperor…</p><p>He stepped out of the Yuan Mansion again, with a self-deprecating smile, slowly raised his head, and opened his eyes.</p><p>Dong!</p><p>His heart suddenly stopped beating, and Zhu Yike’s eyes lost focus.</p><p>“Damn! Am I not dreaming?” “Doubted, Passive Points, +3.”</p><p>“Conjecture, Passive Points, +213.”</p><p>Trigger, trigger… Xu Xiaoshou silently muttered, as if he had grasped something.</p><p>With a sweep of his spiritual senses, he easily detected that the appearance of his little junior sister caused Wangze Holy Emperor’s playful expression to freeze, and the smile on Dao Qiongcang’s face in the First Hall of Sins became stiff.</p><p>Many Spiritual Cultivators watching the battle on Abyss Island, and even the Water Ghost, were surprised.</p><p>In the end, Xu Xiaoshou also saw outside the Forest of Miracles, that Bazhun’an was still carefree, seemingly in control of everything without doing anything.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had an epiphany.</p><p>“Bazhun’an…”</p><p>“White Cave, the Source Seed of the World?”</p><p>Tiansang Spirit Palace, thatched house.</p><p>Xiao Qixiu, the newly appointed figurehead dean, Qiao Qianzhi, the actual director, and Ye Xiaotian, who had stepped down from the position of dean in name, gathered.</p><p>In the cramped and dim room, Zhao Xidong was present, casually holding a piece of grass in his mouth. He was considered the next generation elite to be nurtured by the Spirit Palace.</p><p>Engaged in discussion, they gathered around a wooden table with a plate of roast goose, a pot of wine, and a few cups of tea. Displayed on the table were a demi-saint person, a Saint Origin Crystal, and an Aje with closed eyes.</p><p>“To be honest, I personally think it was a success. Nothing went wrong, but he just hasn’t woken up, which is a bit strange,” Qiao Qianzhi said as he integrated the Saint Origin Crystal into Aje’s body.</p><p>“This is called success?” Ye Xiaotian pointed at the motionless Aje, suppressing his anger. He made a promise and he could not afford to break his word.</p><p>“In theory, nothing went wrong, but this is the first-generation Divine Puppet with its own spiritual intelligence… Maybe he needs some stimulation.” “Such as?”</p><p>“Such as Xu Xiaoshou.” Qiao Qianzhi asserted, “If Xu Xiaoshou comes and wakes him up, there’s a high probability that Aje will regain consciousness..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
