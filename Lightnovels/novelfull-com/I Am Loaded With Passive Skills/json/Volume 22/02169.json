It left already!”</p><p>“That’s great. We’re not dead.”</p><p>“What was that thing? Why was it so huge? The last one was the… Demonic Emperor Black Dragon?”</p><p>The Holy Emperor passed through the Yunlun Mountain Range, took the lives of all the red-clothed people, and flew into Sky City.</p><p>All that was left were the palpitations that filled the mountains and plains.</p><p>Some people from the Eastern Region vaguely recalled the unknown existence that flashed across the sky. They only remembered that the black dragon looked somewhat familiar.</p><p>As for the sea of fire, the blood tree, and the green prison, almost no one recognized them. They only guessed that something strange had happened in Sky City, and even the demi-saint coveted it.</p><p>What they did not know was that these four existences were all Holy Emperors!</p><p>The forest field that had been scorched by the sea of fire had turned extremely dry. Not only were there corpses strewn all over the ground, but even the leaves were charred.</p><p>The sound of footsteps echoed in the forest. As they stepped on the withered branches, they made crisp, crackling sounds.</p><p>A gentle voice sounded.</p><p>“Great Infernal Ancestor, Seven Trees Emperor, Lord Qing Shi of the Divine</p><p>Prison. Is this the White Vein Third Ancestor that you mentioned before?”</p><p>“Demonic Emperor Black Dragon is Black Vein’s boss, the one you followed before?”</p><p>“Aren’t you also a Holy Emperor? What’s your status compared to them?”</p><p>MO MO held a small bronze cauldron and burned some purple sandalwood incense. She was in a forest that had turned deathly silent. She was like an orchid in an empty valley, alone and tranquil.</p><p>She began to talk to herself again after the voice in her mind said goodbye and disappeared.</p><p>“Aren’t you concerned about why I woke up?” Feng Yujin’s voice appeared in her mind, and he sounded a little depressed.</p><p>“It’s not hard to guess that the aura of a Holy Emperor woke you up.” MO MO smiled. She hadn’t heard this noisy voice for a long time, and she actually felt a trace of familiarity.</p><p>But she knew that this kind of familiarity would only last for less than a minute.</p><p>Next, she would have to patiently endure the nagging of a certain Holy Emperor.</p><p>“Alright, you win. The auras of these few fellows were indeed frightening…</p><p>They woke me up, but we’re outside now, so I’m not afraid of them at all!”</p><p>“So, you don’t have any status in the Inner Island and are afraid of them?” MO Mo’s eyes were filled with a hint of playfulness.</p><p>“The Great Infernal Ancestor was really presumptuous. He was so ostentatious and had burned so many of the red-clothed people to death. They must have suffered a lot. It’s better to be outside and free.” Feng Yujin followed MO Mo’s eyes and looked at the surrounding scenery. “Don’t change the topic…”</p><p>“Then don’t talk about the Inner Island!”</p><p>When she heard this exasperated reply, MO MO already read between the lines and laughed.</p><p>“Then you can tell me now. You should know what happened in Sky City.”</p><p>“Also, with regards to your actions…”</p><p>MO MO said as she took out a voice recording bead.</p><p>As soon as the spiritual source came into contact, the voice of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon could be heard.</p><p>“Feng Yujin, please cooperate!”</p><p>His mind was quiet for a moment. In the next second, a heart-wrenching roar sounded.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>“We agreed not to touch this bead. I’ll tell you!”</p><p>“Alright.” MO MO retracted her magic power and was slightly curious. “Tell me everything about Sky City and the reason for the Holy Emperor’s sudden appearance, and your actions.”</p><p>Feng Yujin paused for a long time before he said sadly, “This is a game of chess with a very big layout, and it was already a very long-term plan…” MO MO listened attentively as Feng Yujin started from the beginning.</p><p>“One day, a human swordsman entered the Inner Island of the Abyss Island.</p><p>This was a big deal for the ghost beasts of the Inner Island.”</p><p>“Humans had always been at the bottom of the food chain on the Inner Island. When their spiritual cultivation abilities were sealed, they had nothing.”</p><p>“Like you?” MO MO suddenly said.</p><p>“Don’t interrupt!” Feng Yujin cursed angrily and continued.</p><p>“Very soon, the old drama started, and the process of the Inner Island’s mighty figures toying with the newcomers started in an orderly manner.”</p><p>“But then everyone realized that they were wrong. That was an ancient swordsman. His spiritual cultivation ability was sealed, but he was still terrifyingly strong.”</p><p>“Many existences took turns to attack, but they actually failed to defeat him.</p><p>Instead…’</p><p>“Bazhun’an?” MO MO pondered.</p><p>“Right, I won’t go into the details of how he counterattacked everyone, stepped on the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, and pointed his sword at the Third Ancestor of the White Vein. It’s a little…</p><p>“Unbearable? So, you were beaten up too?”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>Feng Yujin wanted to glare at her fiercely, but he realized that he could not glare at his host body. He could only continue helplessly.</p><p>“In short, after Bazhun’an established himself on the Inner Island, he proclaimed himself the Master of the black and white veins. The ghost beasts on the Inner Island obeyed him.”</p><p>“He was an extremely smart person. He actually said that he was confident he could deal with the Holy Divine Palace and could save everyone from the abyss of suffering.”</p><p>“Actually, no one believed him, but the situation was stronger than the people.</p><p>Everyone had no choice but to follow his arrangements.”</p><p>“Hence, the chess game began…”</p><p>Feng Yujin paused and said.</p><p>“First, he took over the Inner Island’s Black and White vein’s repeated plans over the years to invade the Shengshen Continent. He planned everything and finally chose the Infernal Hell Sea.”</p><p>“He spent another few decades to deceive the Holy Divine Palace. He made them believe that he Bazhun’an was the same as everyone else on the Inner Island. He had no choice but to bow down.”</p><p>“But what he did was the same as what we tried before. He opened the extradimensional space in the Shengshen Continent, but it failed and was successfully blocked by the red-clothed people.”</p><p>“Until the last time, he gathered the power of the Black and White veins that he had not cooperated with for hundreds of years and sent me out…”</p><p>MO MO listened quietly and knew that this was the moment that changed her fate..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
