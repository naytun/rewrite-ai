(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>“Run as far as you can, and don’t turn back!”</p><p>“I want to live. I have to live. For Star Moon and for myself!”</p><p>In the dark space, an ethereal and intermittent song of desolation moved rapidly.</p><p>It dashed through the spatial storm, passed the lawless land, and broke through from an unknown place. However, it used the energy movement of the Shengshen Continent as a guide for its successful escape.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao held on to a ray of hope in the midst of her despair.</p><p>She knew that she could no longer turn back, so she clung on tightly.</p><p>This time, if she couldn’t successfully elude Xu Xiaoshou’s pursuit, the Singer of the Stars and Moon’s attack would have been in vain.</p><p>She, Rao Yaoyao felt no shame about her past and accepted the future of rebirth.</p><p>The Singer of the Stars and Moon’s swan song was very strong. Coupled with Rao Yaoyao’s swordsmanship, she quickly passed through the darkness.</p><p>However, when dawn broke and it became light, the familiar Yunlun Mountain Range and the familiar aura of the rules of the Shengshen Continent greeted her eyes.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was momentarily confused.</p><p>“We’re out?”</p><p>She didn’t understand how she had escaped so quickly.</p><p>Although the ancient swordsman had high combat strength, they prioritized sharpness.</p><p>Therefore, it was not easy for a demi-saint to break through the seal of Abyss Island and successfully travel back to the Shengshen Continent, but it was not impossible.</p><p>However, it was still too fast!</p><p>After all, Rao Yaoyao did not take the initiative to launch the Heavenly Unravel. It was the Singer of the Stars and Moon’s military Unravel. There was no reason for her to come out so quickly.</p><p>Moreover, Rao Yaoyao had explored Abyss Island before and indeed couldn’t enter or leave.</p><p>In the current situation, it seemed that someone had opened the door for her.</p><p>This was why she didn’t get lost among the spatial fragments. She didn’t land at any random site after she came out and instead arrived at the familiar</p><p>Yunlun Mountain Range.</p><p>An insider?</p><p>“Who was it?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s sixth sense told her that something was wrong, but she didn’t have time to think.</p><p>This was because Rao Yaoyao’s remnant soul felt the presence of a great threat as soon as she broke free from the spatial fragments. It was as if something pursued them and was about to arrive.</p><p>“It’s Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had mixed feelings. She didn’t even need to think to know that Xu Xiaoshou would never let her go.</p><p>She used the last of her strength to activate the power of the Singer of the Stars and Moon with a strand of saint’s will to announce her arrival.</p><p>“Woo!”</p><p>The mournful cry of the sword instantly reverberated across the entire Yunlun</p><p>Mountain Range.</p><p>Demi-saint!</p><p>All of the Spiritual Cultivators in the Yunlun Mountain Range seemed to have sensed something, and all of them looked up.</p><p>There were swordsmen, ancient swordsmen, Spiritual Cultivators who used their weapons as swords… All the spiritual swords trembled slightly at the same time, as they shared the sorrow of the death of the Singer of the Stars and Moon.</p><p>This sorrow was passed down to their respective owners through the spiritual swords, and then spread throughout the entire Yunlun Mountain Range.</p><p>Not long after, even Dongtianwang City was filled with the sound of sword cries.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“Another demi-saint had descended. This time, it’s a swordsman?”</p><p>“No, from the commotion, it should be an ancient swordsman. I’m going to make a bold guess. It should be related to Sky City.”</p><p>The foundational roots of Saint Ascension, the burial ground of a Saint!</p><p>Countless people seemed to have thought of something. They tightened their grips on their swords and turned to look in the direction of the Lone Cliff in the Yunlun Mountain Range.</p><p>That was the center of the storm. At this moment, a sound lingered. After the bout of sorrow, the sword could not be seen anymore.</p><p>“Singer of the Stars and Moon!” Elder Yu had chosen to stop using brute force to break Abyss Island’s walls. Instead he decided to spend the rest of his time with his great-granddaughter. He stood up in front of the spirit mirror.</p><p>“Grandpa Yu?” Yu Zhiwen stood up as well and felt a little confused.</p><p>“You’re still young. You’ve only seen Rao Yaoyao use the Xuan Cang, but you don’t know that her previous sword was the Singer of the Stars and Moon. This should be the sound of that spiritual sword…” Elder Yu paused and looked around. “Lass Rao, you’re out?”</p><p>He could not find Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>In other words, Elder Yu subconsciously looked for a specific and whole person.</p><p>After the power of the Singer of the Stars and Moon had completely disappeared, Rao Yaoyao was left with only a bit of regret.</p><p>Her last breath that should have been completely destroyed by the Finger of Annihilation had been saved!</p><p>“Sword Deity Rao is back?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen never doubted Grandpa Yu’s words.</p><p>She sprang up when she heard the voice and took out a small Heaven Secrets compass that was very thin and light. Her two fingers danced and she cast a seal on it.</p><p>The ‘grace’ Guidance was below her feet.</p><p>“Yunlun Mountain Range…”</p><p>“She’s really in the Yunlun Mountain Range, she’s back!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s brows twitched with joy. It was great that Rao Yaoyao was back. She could return the power to her.</p><p>Only the Heavens knew how much pressure she was under after she experienced the Holy Emperor’s passing.</p><p>Even if Grandpa Yu came, he had a mission to complete. He could not delay his actions just because he had to protect her.</p><p>This wasn’t a situation that a junior like her could participate in. She needed someone like the Ruler of the red-clothed people to oversee it.</p><p>As such, Yu Zhiwen didn’t know why Rao Yaoyao had returned.</p><p>However, she could guess that the chaos caused by the Holy Emperor’s crossing the border should have been suppressed by the people of the Holy Divine Palace on Abyss Island, right?</p><p>As such, once Rao Yaoyao’s front troops returned, the rest of the troops would retreat.</p><p>Peace.</p><p>Everyone was safe and sound; there were no casualties. This was Yu Zhiwen’s most simple yet extravagant wish.</p><p>“However… ”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s long eyelashes suddenly trembled, and a hint of worry flashed across her eyes.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was at peace. Did this mean that the Saint Servants were not at peace?</p><p>Then, where was that fellow… “Rao Yaoyao, come and see me soon!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
