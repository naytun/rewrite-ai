(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>However, no matter how powerful he seemed, under such high-frequency and high-intensity attacks from the saint calamity, Mu Ling quickly showed signs of weakening.</p><p>After all, he was not a pure physique cultivator. He was only going against the will of Heaven with the strength of his Penetrating Divine Senses.</p><p>Moreover, when he interfered with the process of the transcend the tribulation, it caused the supreme saint calamity to mutate again. This time, the saint calamity had locked onto Mu Ling.</p><p>In other words, Mu Lin’s current situation meant that he resisted the supreme saint calamity targeted at two people by himself!</p><p>He couldn’t let any lightning bolts strike and leave his disciple Bai Lian to resist it.</p><p>Bai Lian’s higher void level was too weak. In the event that he was hit by the thunder calamity, he would likely die on the spot.</p><p>Under the shocked gazes of the onlookers, Mu Ling had shattered tens of thousands of lightning bolts in the short time of Ten Auras.</p><p>His flesh and blood had started to separate from his body and even the Penetrating Divine Senses could not protect him.</p><p>However, after a loud shout, Mu Ling turned around and flew up as he faced the saint calamity.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, I’ll only give you till the count of three!”</p><p>Mu Ling’s thin lips quivered as he shouted, “If my disciple can’t be saved, I, Mu</p><p>Ling will undergo sanctification. I will definitely follow my master to the Saint</p><p>Mountain and demand an explanation!”</p><p>His gloomy expression was resolute and his black face under his high cheekbones gave people the impression of a poisonous snake that was ready to attack.</p><p>Indeed, with Mu Ling’s intelligence, he could see that his disciple Bai Lian’s crisis was caused by both Water Ghost and Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>However, the water-type Upanishad was only powerful, not crafty.</p><p>Under the supreme saint calamity, Water Ghost could only protect himself. He could not care less about Bai Lian’s life and death. He had already burned his bridges.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was different. He had been affected by the saint calamity and was a Saint Stage Divine Sorcerer.</p><p>If he didn’t have a backup plan, why would he be willing to take the risk?</p><p>Perhaps Dao Qiongcang had a way to resolve the situation when Bai Lian was targeted by the saint calamity!</p><p>Mu Ling could only take it head-on, but he couldn’t break the saint calamity’s lock on. He was just a Spiritual Cultivator like Water Ghost and wasn’t skilled in the art of deceit.</p><p>Therefore, under such circumstances, Mu Ling could only secretly take note of what Water Ghost did and push all the blame to Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>As long as Dao Qiongcang was suppressed and helped Bai Lian, his disciple would be able to come back to life.</p><p>If he was not pressured…</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the semi-saint person appeared above Mu Ling’s head.</p><p>He infused a bit of his blood essence into it, and under the Nine Heavens saint calamity, another saint calamity was reborn.</p><p>If Dao Qiongcang wasn’t suppressed, he, Mu Ling, wouldn’t die from the sanctification today. He would naturally follow the killing oath and lead his Supreme Master Long Rongzhi to attack the Saint mountain to seek justice for his disciple Bai Lian!</p><p>No one could bully the Infernal lineage!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A thunderclap pierced everyone’s hearts.</p><p>“Semi-saint person!”</p><p>“Abyss Island is indeed worthy of being called the land of sanctification.”</p><p>“Mu Ling can only undergo sanctification. If he doesn’t undergo sanctification, I’m afraid he won’t even be able to last for three auras.</p><p>“But if he used the semi-saint person, Mu Ling would not have any way out.”</p><p>“Today, even if Hallmaster Dao had the means to resolve Bai Lian’s crisis, Mu</p><p>Ling will definitely die if he can’t pass the saint calamity.”</p><p>“Yes, his saint calamity is clearly not as strong as the supreme saint calamity. Now, he is forced to undergo his own saint calamity at the same time as the supreme saint calamity…”</p><p>“Tsk tsk, Water Ghost really caused a lot of harm!”</p><p>“What do you know! Perhaps this was what Hallmaster Dao was happy to see. With the help of Water Ghost’s supreme saint calamity, he had cut off a big part of the inheritance of the Infernal lineage and also an arm of the Holy Palace, but no one could tell.”</p><p>“Hiss, brother, your insight very unique… And you are?”</p><p>“Li Fugui.”</p><p>No one knew the joy Water Ghost felt in the midst of the saint calamity and the roar of thunder.</p><p>He had only played a small trick, and the Holy Palace and the Holy Divine Palace had turned against each other. This was exactly what the Saint Servant wanted to see.</p><p>So what if it was Dao Qiongcang?</p><p>If he didn’t enter the game, the world would still have to give him three points.</p><p>This was because Dao Qiongcang’s ability to exert the energy as a chess player was too great.</p><p>However, once they entered the game, they were all chess pieces.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was not known for his single frontal combat ability. He was good at planning and making advance arrangements with the Divine Secret.</p><p>However, on Abyss Island, he, Water Ghost was the true powerful chess player.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was at most a little stronger. This was not his territory.</p><p>He was in peak condition and had a quick mind. He had mastered half of Yan Wuse’s Upanishad.</p><p>However, those who didn’t reach the Upanishad realm were all trash!</p><p>They would never know how terrifying a Upanishad demi-saint could be when he used his full strength.</p><p>Water Ghost was concerned about Sleeveless, and he knew that this dirty trick would only make the people of the Infernal lineage hate him.</p><p>But that’s not my problem!</p><p>Bai Lian and Mu Ling weren’t even close to Water Ghost, so why couldn’t he sacrifice them?</p><p>He, Water Ghost could even lock up his son and use his identity to set up a trap.</p><p>For the sake of the Struggle for the Great Path, if he still cared about whether his methods were dirty or not, why would he be given the title of the ‘Great Demon King’ by the world in the past?</p><p>“Three!”</p><p>Mu Ling’s semi-saint person had already started to absorb the energy of the thunder calamity. He started his countdown and the pressure was enough.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang could not ignore it.</p><p>It was true that Bai Lian’s current state was bleak, and this was also the situation he wanted to see.</p><p>However, if Mu Ling was involved, and he might even reverse the sanctification, the consequences would be too great.</p><p>However, Dao Qiongcang was still Dao Qiongcang after all. He was not bothered about the pressure and only freed himself from the thunder calamity. He said.</p><p>“Mu Ling, you should know what you are doing now.”</p><p>“Regardless of the cause and effect, what you have done was to obstruct the Holy Divine Palace and prevent it from carrying out its mission and you colluded with the Saint Servant.”</p><p>“If I did this. in the future…</p><p>Before he could finish his words, Mu Ling forcefully interrupted while he resisted the saint calamity.</p><p>“I don’t care about the future, I only care about the present!”</p><p>“If Bai Lian dies today, you, Dao Qiongcang, won’t be able to live on in peace.</p><p>You don’t care about the cause and effect, but I can only see what’s in front of me..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
