(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio     Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“Such strength…”</p><p>When the power of the Holy Emperor and the Disillusionment Finger overlapped, the entire Abyss Island trembled. “Holy Emperor Xu is really out for blood?”</p><p>“Fairy Rao is not easy to kill. Her backer…”</p><p>“Lord Shou is too impulsive. You mustn’t do this. It’ll cause a huge disaster!” A magnificent surge of power rippled out, and everyone who heard it paled.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang wanted to stop him, but Xu Xiaoshou was too fast. He had seized the moment when he was sent flying to appear at Rao Yaoyao’s side and launched an attack.</p><p>At this moment, the divine Sinan wasn’t even in his hands!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was kicked into the ground, and the last thing he saw was a sky full of flames that was submerged deep into the ground.</p><p>Like the sun that dropped to the ground.</p><p>“Ming Yi…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s fingertips trembled as he created an illusory zipper. If he wanted to make a move, it would eventually stagnate.</p><p>Before he set off, he had made a divination for himself.</p><p>The divinations weren’t good. They could even be considered bad, just like what had taken place now. The sun that dropped to the ground represented disappointment.</p><p>In such a situation, the best thing to do was to protect himself.</p><p>Otherwise, even though he wouldn’t end up like Yan Wuse, he would be in an even more miserable state.</p><p>“Variable…”</p><p>Until now, Dao Qiongcang had an enlightenment.</p><p>From the time he paid attention to the battle on Abyss Island until now, Xiao Qi had collected all the battle data.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had many speculations about the ‘variable’ that he couldn’t even calculate before this happened.</p><p>From the start, it was Xu Xiaoshou who was undoubtedly Bazhun’an’s most interesting card.</p><p>Later on, when the Five Decays of Heaven and Man entered the battlefield with the Blood World Pearl, Dao Qiongcang changed his mind and thought it was him.</p><p>After that, Water Ghost revealed himself, killed Yan Wuse and took away the semi-saint person. Dao Qiongcang thought that this was something he had not expected.</p><p>But now it seemed…</p><p>Everything was clearly within their control. It was the worst outcome that they could have expected when they sent Yan Wuse and Number Two out to fight.</p><p>The variable that he couldn’t predict had never changed from the beginning to the end.</p><p>“It was Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>This was the most obvious target, and it had been hidden in the Holy Emperor’s hundred-year plan. It started from the White Cave, and it was hidden even deeper than Water Ghost.</p><p>Until now, it started to show its might.</p><p>The ones who determined the Holy Divine Palace’s defeat were Bazhun’an and Water Ghost and it had never changed.</p><p>It was Xu Xiaoshou, the only unknown variable, that allowed him to divine the Ming Yi hexagram!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang only hesitated for a moment before he crushed the spatial zipper. He let out a long sigh of relief and obediently laid down in the deep underground pit and no longer put up any resistance.</p><p>He had been very proactive in the guidance of the development of the situation since his debut.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou was too vicious!</p><p>This kid was so smart that he didn’t even save the last blow for him. He knew that he still had a trump card.</p><p>Therefore, he chose to force himself out of the battle and gave the final blow to Rao Yaoyao, who had completely understood the situation, but had yet to fully develop her wings.</p><p>If the finger was pointed at him, Dao Qiongcang would have attacked.</p><p>But it pointed at Rao Yaoyao…</p><p>In the previous hexagram, the words were very clear. If the light was damaged, he had to hide his strength and bide his time.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang did not dare to make any more moves. He had vaguely seen the consequences of his interference.</p><p>But was Rao Yaoyao really that easy to kill?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, ah, Xu Xiaoshou, you are still young. You don’t know the foundation of the Holy Emperor’s aristocratic family…”</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>After he condensed one finger, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t wait for Dao Qiongcang to stop him, which was a little strange.</p><p>However, an unexpected person appeared!</p><p>Water Ghost actually withstood the saint calamity that had almost ended and flashed over. He shouted loudly at him to stop.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, don’t be rash. Just take her semi-saint person!”</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because her surname is Rao?</p><p>The word ‘Rao’ had suppressed you, Water Ghost, and you, Great Demon King Yu MO?</p><p>So, you dared to kill Yan Wuse but didn’t dare to touch Rao Yaoyao. You only wanted to take her semi-saint person?</p><p>“Get lost! ”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou once again sent Rao Yaoyao flying. The power of his finger was not reduced, but increased instead. He even used the condensing method of the infernal heavens to forcefully combine the two forces in order to form a fatal blow.</p><p>This finger was no longer the Holy Emperor Disillusionment Finger.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was willing to call it the ‘finger of body and spirit destruction’!</p><p>Under the supreme saint calamity, Water Ghost clearly saw the contempt in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes, that were covered in white flames. He almost fainted from anger.</p><p>How can a brat like you bear the karma of killing the descendant of an aristocratic family of the Holy Emperor?</p><p>You just need to take her semi-saint person and then Bazhun’an will deal with her.</p><p>What kind of power did you want to show off in this Saint war?</p><p>Do you really think you’re invincible just because you have the power of a Holy Emperor?</p><p>That’s only one of the factors. You won’t have this kind of power in the future, but will the aristocratic family of the Holy Emperor allow you to grow?</p><p>“You’re only in the Dao Realm!” Water Ghost shouted.</p><p>This inexplicable sentence did not make any sense and made the spectators confused.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was also momentarily stunned.</p><p>However, Water Ghost had no time to explain and Xu Xiaoshou had no time to listen to him.</p><p>Both sides trusted their own intelligence, so they summarized the situation.</p><p>When he saw the message ‘Worried’ that popped up in the Information Bar, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly understood what Water Ghost meant.</p><p>“I’m only at the Dao realm. I still have a long way to go before I become a demi-saint and have the ability to fight a Holy Emperor.”</p><p>“So Cutie Rao shouldn’t be killed by me, but by him?”</p><p>At this point in his train of thought, Xu Xiaoshou caught a glimpse of Rao Yaoyao, who had been sent flying by his kick and bled profusely, from the corner of his eye. There seemed to be a hint of mockery in her eyes..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
