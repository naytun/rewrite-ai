It flowed out of his body and cut through the Abyss.</p><p>He paused for a long time before finally taking a step forward.</p><p>However, the footprints left behind were wrapped in sword energy and could not be removed for a long time.</p><p>“No worries.”</p><p>“I’m not You Tu, and Little Shou is not me.”</p><p>“Who dares to call me by my name!”</p><p>On the ruins of the First Hal of Sins, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly shouted. A sea of white flame rolled up, suppressing all the heated discussions.</p><p>His spiritual senses had been strengthened by the power of the Holy Emperor to an extremely sensitive level, so he could clearly hear the discussions amongst the various Spiritual Cultivators beneath him.</p><p>Even in the blindspots that his spiritual senses couldn’t cover, the criticism of the words ‘Xu Xiaoshou’ could be heard.</p><p>This was very familiar.</p><p>It is disrespectful to call a Saint’s name directly!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that this was the ability of a demi-saint.</p><p>However, he wasn’t a demi-saint. He wasn’t a true demi-saint yet.</p><p>Therefore, he couldn’t trace back to the locations of those people who were talking about him, which were scattered all over the Abyss Island.</p><p>It didn’t matter anymore.</p><p>Right now, the most important thing was to teach the ‘disrespectful’ Adorable Rao a lesson.</p><p>The fire in his body couldn’t be suppressed anymore and needed to be vented!</p><p>“There’s an easy way out to heaven, but you refuse to take it. You’ve chosen to come to hell when there’s no exit. You’re cute, but today, you’ll pay the price for your arrogance!”</p><p>“A Holy Emperor shall not be insulted!”</p><p>Standing on an ice lotus, carrying white wings on his back, and holding a flaming python, Xu Xiaoshou, who had been imbued with the power of a Holy Emperor, flung off his charred arms and pounced on Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>This little cutie had a deep background, but as long as he had some sense of propriety, he wouldn’t kill her.</p><p>Thinking about it, he wouldn’t go to the extent of provoking a Holy Emperor on Abyss Island.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>The black light above the white sea of fire flashed and tore through space.</p><p>When he reappeared, the Sleeveless, Scarlet Scorched Hand was already reaching for Rao Yaoyao’s neck.</p><p>“Jumping around like a rampant and shameless clown rampant. Xu Xiaoshou, you are making a fool of yourself!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was so angry that her delicate body was trembling, but she wasn’t like Xu Xiaoshou who had a glib tongue and was full of vulgarities.</p><p>Even her angry words were civilized. She could not vent her anger even if she wanted to curse. She could only draw her sword.</p><p>The cultivation of the Emotion Sword Technique was about cultivating one’s heart and self-restraint.</p><p>There weren’t many sword forms that focused on actual combat, and they weren’t comparable to the MO Sword Technique or the Ten Thousand Sword Techinique.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had chosen her path with this sword technique, and her use of the sword was also very formal and civilized like her personality. She had never acted recklessly.</p><p>However, this didn’t mean that she, Rao Yaoyao, only cultivated the Emotion Sword Technique and didn’t cultivate other sword techniques.</p><p>When she was extremely angry, the Emotion Sword Technique would not be the method she would use to fight.</p><p>Instead, the Nine Major Sword Techniques, the Eighteen Sword Forms, and the 3000 Sword styles took turns.</p><p>“Swordless Sword Form!”</p><p>When the Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand grabbed over, Rao Yaoyao didn’t dodge or press forward, her body disappearing into nothingness.</p><p>At the same time, a whirlwind appeared under her feet, and a holy realm was formed.</p><p>In the surrounding area, the light and shadow of thousands of scenes deepened, and the white flame that burned her body, her power, and her path became even more dazzling.</p><p>And when “Being” reached the pinnacle, “Nothing” also reached the pinnacle.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s sword-wielding body completely disappeared, as if she had never appeared in this world.</p><p>The Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand passed through her neck and it could not grasp anything solid.</p><p>“Vanishing Technique?” Xu Xiaoshou’s heart tightened. This was too similar!</p><p>If it was any other time, he really would have lost Rao Yaoyao’s position.</p><p>Now, however, he could still lock onto Rao Yaoyao’s aura with the power of a Holy Emperor.</p><p>Right here!</p><p>It was right above this intensified, shadowy world of myriad red dust.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s ‘nothingness’ was presented in a world of ‘existence’ in another way.</p><p>“Secular Sword, All Life Form…</p><p>The Saint Language suddenly sounded from all directions.</p><p>Although they had been defeated repeatedly after taking turns fighting, Rao Yaoyao’s talent and her comprehension of the Dao were extremely deep.</p><p>The All Living Forms she used now seemed to have evolved and no longer summoned Intangible objects.</p><p>Instead, she was using the scenes in the Holy Realm that had been deepened to the extreme by the word ‘Being’, borrowing its power to strengthen her sword.</p><p>“All Things are Swords!”</p><p>With a buzzing sound, the sound of sword cries could be heard from all directions. Xu Xiaoshou stopped and looked around as if he had entered a dangerous situation.</p><p>“The Worship of Ten Thousand Swords!”</p><p>Grass, trees, rocks, light and shadow aura, elemental objects…</p><p>Everything in the world was not only visible but also intangible. They formed swords out of thin air and turned into ten thousand sharp swords that descended from the sky.</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s body was cracked open as if he had entered the enemy’s force field. Even his blood was stabbed and burned.</p><p>“Is this the true combat strength of Ancient Sword Saint?” Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>He still couldn’t find his target.</p><p>However, Rao Yaoyao, who was proficient in swordsmanship, was much more capable than before in a one-on-one fight without any worries.</p><p>“All Swords to the Master!”</p><p>Another delicate shout sounded.</p><p>The intangible swords of Heaven and Earth condensed in midair before transforming into a suspended sky sword.</p><p>The sword body was surrounded by the aura of the mortal world. It was based on the existence of Abyss Island and circulated all living beings in the world.</p><p>“She’s right there!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked up and saw Rao Yaoyao’s sacred and solemn figure in the giant sword that hung in the sky.</p><p>“Buzz, buzz, buzz…</p><p>Without any pause, Rao Yaoyao’s figure was exposed. The Sky Sword split into nine, hundreds, and infinite.</p><p>“Infinite Number!”</p><p>She combined the Swordless Sword Technique, Ten Thousand Sword Technique, Emotion Sword Technique, and then the Nine Swords Technique.</p><p>When the infinite swords merged into one and into the Sky Sword…</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s sword had been amplified to its final strength. In terms of Qi’s will, it had already surpassed the might of a demi-saint.</p><p>The Supreme Saint Calamity rumbled.</p><p>However, when it landed on the Sky Sword, the sword didn’t even move and was already sliced into pieces by its sharpness. It turned into lightning and disappeared..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
