(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>A soft sound rang out.</p><p>Flame Python emitted a white flame that passed through the Heavenly</p><p>Ancestor Light. It was as if there was no obstruction as it broke through it.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>When the saint calamity sounded again, it meant that everyone had been freed from the shackles of the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff.</p><p>When he came back to his senses, he saw that the Heavenly Ancestor Light had split into two and slid down Dao Qiongcang’s body.</p><p>It was dangerous, but it didn’t hit him!</p><p>“It was sliced apart?”</p><p>Countless people were shocked.</p><p>This Si Wu Formation Heavenly Ancestor’s power had undoubtedly reached the level of a Holy Emperor.</p><p>Even if Xu Xiaoshou exploded, he couldn’t break this beam of light, right?</p><p>How did his strength rise to such a level within a short period of time?</p><p>Did he borrow the power of the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff?</p><p>No, this was the aura of the Infernal lineage!</p><p>However, the expert of the Infernal lineage, Demi-Saint Infernal Long Rongzhi, would not have such a powerful pressure even if his original body was here, right?</p><p>When they looked at Xu Xiaoshou, who was in the sky and looked like the Flame Lord who had descended, and felt the aura that made everything tremble, everyone had to confirm this absurd guess.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is a Holy Emperor now?”</p><p>What kind of joke was this!</p><p>As he stood at the top of the void with the famed sword Flame Python in his hand, Xu Xiaoshou, who endured the torturous pain of his splintering body, was slightly distracted.</p><p>He stared blankly at the sword that he had used to slash out. He looked at the sword that did not have the Ancient Sword Technique at all. It was purely venting, but it could cut through the Heavenly Ancestor Light. These thoughts surged in his mind. “Me! Xu Xiaoshou! Holy Emperor?”</p><p>“Isn’t this invincible?”</p><p>In the next second, intense pain assaulted Xu Xiaoshou, and he suddenly woke up from his daydream.</p><p>Such a powerful force did not belong to him at all. It definitely came from the Ultimate Grand Ancestor, the Great Infernal Ancestor!</p><p>However, there was a difference between this and the time when the Holy Emperor Fengtian Feng Yujin took possession of the gray fog dragon at the Tianxuan Gate of the Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>This time, there was only strength and no will in the infusion of Holy Emperor’s power. As a result, it did not trigger the Passive System’s resistance and erase the power.</p><p>“This was Bazhun’an’s backup plan?”</p><p>“To use the land of the Desolate Inferno Domain, it should be a weak spot in the space that is connected to the Inner Island of the Abyss Island.”</p><p>“If I use the heavenly flame of Ember Heart from the Infernal lineage, I’ll be able to control the power of the Holy Emperor for a short period of time?”</p><p>“But it hurts too much!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had a ferocious look on his face and his skin started to crack.</p><p>However, it was not blood that seeped out of the broken skin. Instead, it was white flames and the overflowing power of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>It was as if he had become a human treasure.</p><p>Any fire-type Spiritual Cultivator who was nearby could easily achieve enlightenment and breakthrough with just a lick or a sniff.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Mu Ling was one of them.</p><p>He did not have good control over the Flame of Annihilation, but now, it was extremely obedient in the presence of the king of fires.</p><p>Moreover, under the supreme saint calamity just now, his broken body healed itself quickly when it came into contact with the fire-type Holy Emperor’s power emitted from Xu Xiaoshou’s body.</p><p>Like rain after a long drought, Mu Ling’s body automatically started to swallow the energy.</p><p>He seemed to realize something. He hurriedly opened the alchemy cauldron and brought Bai Lian out.</p><p>As expected, Bai Lian, who was on the verge of death, let out a comfortable groan the moment he came into contact with this infernal aura.</p><p>His eyelids quivered, and he quickly opened his eyes. He actually woke up and began to swallow the infernal power in large mouthfuls.</p><p>“This is?”</p><p>As Bai Lian swallowed, he looked at the figure that stood amid the white sea of fire, who was even more powerful than his grandmaster Long Rongzhi.</p><p>So familiar…</p><p>Why did this person look like Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>“Don’t ask, continue to swallow!”</p><p>Mu Ling didn’t waste any time on words. He knew that Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t take back this power. It would be a waste if he didn’t swallow it.</p><p>Only the two of them were left from the Infernal lineage. No one else could get a share of this great opportunity.</p><p>If Heaven gifted you with something, but you don’t take it, then you would only suffer!</p><p>“Oh my God…”</p><p>The people who watched the battle through various means felt their scalps go numb.</p><p>In an instant, Mu Ling’s injuries from the force of the saint calamity were healed .</p><p>Bai Lian even summoned the Nine Death Thunder Calamity with a boom above his head.</p><p>And all of this was just a taste of the sweetness that leaked out of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>It was hard to imagine what had happened to Xu Xiaoshou’s body at this moment. How could he become the carrier of such a huge force?</p><p>“Ghost beast host body?”</p><p>“I heard that the White Cave’s predecessor of the Infernal Hell Sea, was one of the Seven Breaks. It once gave birth to a very terrifying ghost beast…”</p><p>“No! No! Look, Xu Xiaoshou’s self-will doesn’t seem to be lost. Perhaps he was not possessed! Could it be a form of symbiosis?”</p><p>“You guys are too naive. On the Inner Island of the Abyss Island, the Eighth Sword Deity is the Master of the black and white veins. You guys don’t know this, right?”</p><p>“The ghost beasts are all his subordinates. How would they dare to possess Xu Xiaoshou? This is just a simple borrowing of power!”</p><p>“Bullshit!” Li Fugui’s face turned red as he rebuked. “In our opinion, Hallmaster</p><p>Dao manipulated the Si Wu Formation to secretly break the seal on the Inner Island. This caused the ghost beasts’ power to leak out and was his attempt to possess Xu Xiaoshou… Hallmaster Dao, this deceitful plan of yours is truly amazing!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t hear what the others were talking about. He only felt that he had returned to the state when he first swallowed the Fire Seed by the Goose Lake in the Tiansang Spirit Palace. “+(Attacked. Passive Points+)+l.”</p><p>“+(Attacked. Passive Points+)+l.”</p><p>The Information Bar kept popping up. Xu Xiaoshou’s body was being roasted.</p><p>He could clearly feel that he was just a container, and there were cracks everywhere.</p><p>The power poured into his body like a tide, but it kept flowing out. He could not stop it at all.</p><p>However, the white bead continued to transmit power!</p><p>As long as he was unable to enter, he could temporarily stay at the Holy Emperor level as a vessel and do something..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
