Quite leisurely!”</p><p>This sarcastic remark chilled Rao Yaoyao’s pretty face, fueling her anger.</p><p>With a smile, Water Ghost disappeared again, only to reappear inside the unguarded Rao Yaoyao, merging into her body.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s face changed drastically; she had fallen for such a simple provocation!</p><p>The power of the two God’s Blessings could still continue here!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao swore that she would never take someone else’s elixirs for the rest of her life, even if it meant death!</p><p>Azure Finger, disregarding spacetime, pointed from the Desolate Inferno Domain towards the First Hall of Sins, causing panic among the spectators below.</p><p>“Do you dare to kill me?” Water Ghost appeared behind Rao Yaoyao, condensed into a blurry upper body, and sneered, “Do you dare to let Rao Yaoyao die with</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor did not respond.</p><p>Azure Finger remained unmoved.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao never expected the calamity to strike so abruptly.

Dao Qiongcang’s hand moved again. “Enough!”</p><p>A loud shout erupted in the sky.</p><p>Accompanied by the angry voice, the Heavenly Ancestor Light descended, piercing Azure Finger and quickly wiping it out. All eyes turned to the source of the sound in shock.</p><p>It was Xu Xiaoshou’s voice!</p><p>Hovering above the Desolate Inferno Domain, Xu Xiaoshou transformed into Holy Light, his fully unleashed aura radiating.</p><p>He surpassed everyone’s expectations, completed the acceptance of power, regained his sanity, and joined the battle.</p><p>“Rao Wangze, you are too arrogant. How dare you even think of testing my power?” After stepping out of the Holy Light, Xu Xiaoshou stared directly at the distant figure.</p><p>Without a doubt, Rao Wangze relentlessly pursued Water Ghost, completely ignoring Xu Xiaoshou, who had inherited the power.</p><p>This was nothing short of sheer arrogance!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew his intentions.</p><p>He just wanted to see how far he could go and whether he could obliterate his thought incarnation.</p><p>However, after completing the power acceptance, Xu Xiaoshou understood the terror of Bazhun’an’s move.</p><p>Whether Rao Wangze was genuinely confident or overly arrogant, Xu Xiaoshou could not tell.</p><p>But…</p><p>“Since you want to try, then go ahead!”</p><p>Looking at the blurred face, and reading the ambiguous expression, Xu Xiaoshou felt insulted.</p><p>“Ridiculed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>He was really being mocked!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was furious. Standing in the Si Wu Formation, he connected his spiritual senses to the cooled Dark Iron Sword on the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>He had understood everything.</p><p>Water Ghost communicated with Abyss Island using the array wheel given by Patriarch Wuji.</p><p>To connect with the Inner Island and borrow the power of the Holy Emperor inside, one had to use the array wheel from Bazhun’an. And Bazhun’an’s array wheel was the long-forgotten sword.</p><p>“Si Wu Formation, dissolve!”</p><p>With a shout, the three hundred and sixty-five Void Suppression Steles and Nine Cores of Abyss Island, including Xu Xiaoshou himself, shifted positions.</p><p>The sword on the Fallen Abyss emitted a bright light.</p><p>“Boom…”</p><p>The Order of the Great Path emerged in the world, and the Inner Island was presented as a mirror. Countless ghost beasts that were once intangible became tangible.</p><p>The path to the Inner Island seemed to be opening!</p><p>However, at this moment, Rao Wangze’s expression became more concrete and more playful.</p><p>He finally spoke directly, lightly laughing at Xu Xiaoshou, “Did you really think you could unravel the Si Wu Formation?”</p><p>Snap.</p><p>Before Xu Xiaoshou could infuse all his power into the cooling Dark Iron Sword, a strong wind pressure gathered.</p><p>The sword thrown down by Bazhun’an was blasted into nothingness.</p><p>In that instant, Abyss Island seemed to fall silent.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression also froze.</p><p>“Heh.” On the ruins of the First Hall of Sins, Dao Qiongcang’s lips curled up slightly, but he suppressed it.</p><p>People had forgotten this sword, but when Dao Qiongcang was hit, he remembered it.</p><p>During the chaotic battle, Dao Qiongcang, who had already seen the core array eye, surreptitiously informed Rao Wangze of this information.</p><p>This move cut off all transformation in Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Bazhun’an, what are you thinking?” Dao Qiongcang smiled and glanced at the figure outside the Forest of Miracles. However, he saw that the person remained calm, and his brows furrowed.</p><p>He immediately sensed that something was amiss and, pinching his fingers hidden in his sleeve, his expression slightly stiffened.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>On the Desolate Inferno Domain, Xu Xiaoshou’s actions only paused for a moment, and a surging aura emanated from his Yuan Mansion.</p><p>Wait, Yuan Mansion?</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points +1..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
