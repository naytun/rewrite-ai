(3)</p><p>A switcheroo?</p><p>The golden cicada shed its shell?</p><p>However, this was all within the Spell Forbidden Barrier!</p><p>Even if no one saw Dao Qiongcang switch identities earlier, could Dao Qiongcang really pull it off?</p><p>“I’m sorry, Xiao Qi.”</p><p>With a sigh, another Xiao Qi appeared on the shoulders of the Divine Elf Qi.</p><p>This Xiao Qi transformed into Dao Qiongcang and held the Divine Sinan with a dignified air.</p><p>The newly emerged Dao Qiongcang seemed to exist in a different world.</p><p>The deep sea was undoubtedly powerful, but its power could not penetrate the holy realm to affect Dao Qiongcang in the special Divine World.</p><p>The most obvious difference between the higher void and the demi-saint was the difference in their realm!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang utilized this to the fullest, using the holy realm to counter the Water Ghost’s powerful attack.</p><p>“Is Dao Qiongcang actually Xiao Qi, and vice versa?” This transformation left all the onlookers stunned.</p><p>So, when did this change happen? Everyone was lost in thought.</p><p>Even the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon had a brief moment of confusion in its eyes.</p><p>But with its external brain, it chose to stop thinking and asked in a questioning tone, “Xu Xiaoshou, do you understand?”</p><p>On the dragon’s head, Xu Xiaoshou was momentarily perplexed but soon realized, “It’s not a spontaneous change!”</p><p>“Since the moment Dao Qiongcang arrived on the island, he wasn’t Dao Qiongcang but rather an impersonation by Xiao Qi…”</p><p>“Conversely, the Xiao Qi from before, who displayed emotions like anger, fear, obedience, and cuteness, was the real Dao Qiongcang?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the dignified Dao Qiongcang outside the deep sea, and it was difficult to reconcile this with the playful Divine Elf they had seen before.</p><p>They were clearly two distinct entities with such a stark contrast.</p><p>But when all the impossibilities were eliminated, what remained, no matter how unlikely, had to be the truth!</p><p>So…</p><p>Could Dao Qiongcang really be so shameless as to impersonate Xiao Qi?</p><p>Did he not feel at all embarrassed during this process?</p><p>“Ah! My eyes!” Xu Xiaoshou felt tainted and desperately needed a pair of eyes that had not seen Xiao Qi acting adorable.</p><p>He finally remembered the special nickname that people from Bazhun’an’s era had given to Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>“Elder Dao the Flamboyant…”</p><p>Above the deep sea, the Water Ghost almost simultaneously came to the same realization Xu Xiaoshou had.</p><p>His lips trembled, his eyes twitched, his toes curled, and after struggling for a while, he could only let out a short sigh, “As expected of you…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang did not feel ashamed. He took pride in it.</p><p>Back when the news of the Spell Forbidden Barrier beneath the Lone Cliff had first reached him, he had already conjured numerous theories and was very skeptical.</p><p>Now, after verification, it was confirmed that the secondary plane door was indeed under the control of the Water Ghost.</p><p>Validation with a fake body was much better than having a demi-saint incarnation destroyed as soon as he reached Abyss Island.</p><p>How embarrassing would that be?</p><p>As for Xiao Qi…</p><p>Although he did not want to admit it so heartlessly, it was possible to recreate another Xiao Qi because all the data was available.</p><p>Xiao Qi was trapped in the deep sea, sealed by the Spell Forbidden Barrier, and Dao Qiongcang, operating from the outside, had no easy way to rescue it.</p><p>While he could intervene, any power sent into the deep sea would be erased, even Holy Power.</p><p>If the Water Ghost wanted Xiao Qi’s life, all it would take was one more attack to finish it off.</p><p>However, as long as Dao Qiongcang remained on the sidelines, he had more ways to handle the situation created by the “Deep Sea” and the “Spell Forbidden Barrier.”</p><p>“Divine Thirty-Six Form, Great Annihilation Technique!”</p><p>In a state of isolation from the deep sea and within the confines of the holy realm, Dao Qiongcang waved his star dipper, and the Divine Sinan resonated with a clattering mechanical sound.</p><p>The Celestial Scroll covered the entire deep sea.</p><p>If one were to liken the deep sea to a sphere, inside it lay the most supreme rules of the Spell Forbidden Barrier, impervious even to demi-saints.</p><p>With Dao Qiongcang outside, all he had to do was exile the space containing this sphere and then use the Divine Force to annihilate it.</p><p>As a result, the deep sea would be destroyed, and the Spell Forbidden Barrier would vanish.</p><p>“Decree!”</p><p>With the point of a finger, the Celestial Scroll curled up, and those within the deep sea felt an inexplicable marvel descend upon them:</p><p>They were still inside the water sphere but had lost the suffocating feeling of drowning.</p><p>At the same time, the draining power from the deep sea also disappeared.</p><p>The vast Deep Sea World, which had submerged the entire Abyss Island, was annihilated by Dao Qiongcang’s Divine Force in an instant.</p><p>The demi-saint outside the deep sea made a move, and the higher void Water Ghost would find it difficult to resist.</p><p>The Water Ghost was undoubtedly aware of this.</p><p>When Dao Qiongcang sprang into action, Water Ghost, who had long suspected that Elder Dao the Flamboyant would not die so easily, also made his move.</p><p>He did not even attempt to counter the power of a Saint Stage Divine Sorcerer, knowing it would be as futile as trying to break a stone with an egg.</p><p>So, the Water Ghost continued to focus on his own actions.</p><p>At the same moment that the Deep Sea World was being annihilated, the Water Ghost performed four successive moves in cold blood!</p><p>First, he hurled the Sea God’s Trident toward the demi-saint person above Rao Yaoyao at Fallen Abyss.</p><p>Then, with a swift motion, as the power of the secondary plane door unleashed, he manipulated the Original Sealing Spear from a distance. He obliterated the Divine Elf Qi, who had deceived him, reducing it to pieces, leaving no trace.</p><p>Simultaneously, above the Forest of Miracles, the ancient gate opened and closed at the right moment. Situ Yongren, who had recently managed to escape from Bazhun’an and Mei Siren, now found himself bewildered and captured. He was lifted as if by an invisible force, just as Five Decays of Heaven and Man had been days earlier, his face filled with despair.</p><p>At the same time, Water Ghost appeared at the location of the Desolate Inferno Domain, and amidst the gaze of someone who was both shocked and a little embarrassed while being naked, Water Ghost stood on the molten lava of the volcano. He began to unleash the Water-type Upanishad, forming a blood contract with the demi-saint person!</p><p>“Three choices…”</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, it’s time for you to make a choice!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
