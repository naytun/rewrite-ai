(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio     Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“I can’t get out. It is likely that no one can get in from the outside either. Therefore, Elder Yu must have been blocked…</p><p>“That’s right. If it were me, how could I let even one of them leave in the midst of such a good situation?”</p><p>“Everything… Except for me, everyone must die!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s eyes narrowed as he glanced at Rao Yaoyao before he opened his mouth to say something.</p><p>At this moment, his Perception picked up the auras of four powerful Holy Emperors that came from Abyss Island.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang sighed deeply.</p><p>“Why did you sigh?” Rao Yaoyao looked as if she faced a great enemy, but there were no traces of fear in her eyes.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang glanced at her and opened his mouth. He sighed again.</p><p>“Chaotic Heavenly Dipper!”</p><p>At this moment, Wangze Holy Emperor’s expression was no longer playful. He pointed at the Wind Rites Sutra.</p><p>He really didn’t expect that Dao Qiongcang would miscalculate one day.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou borrowed the power of the Holy Emperor and did not use the Fallen Abyss’s Sword Will. He had other methods.</p><p>Even Wangze Holy Emperor was caught off guard by this instantaneous Transformation.</p><p>When he launched another attack, he didn’t hold back.</p><p>Because at this moment, Wangze Holy Emperor sensed with his Perception that another Holy Emperor’s aura was coming. He was in great danger.</p><p>“Rumble! Rumble!”</p><p>Violent wind energy surged from the Wind Rites Sutra. When the green wind dragon swept across, even the Way of the Heavens shattered and turned into power in its midst.</p><p>This move wasn’t directed at Xu Xiaoshou, but at Lei Xi’er, who was the Master of the White Cave and had opened up a power channel!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had the power of the four Holy Emperors as protection. Although it was still very shallow, he could not kill him for the moment.</p><p>However, as long as he killed this silver-haired girl and cut off the passageway, he still stood a chance to resolve this situation.</p><p>However, just as the green wind rolled up, the dark clouds closed in and a dragon’s roar broke through the sky and suppressed the entire scene.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Outside the Green Dragon Gate, a mass of black energy surged forth.</p><p>The undigested power of the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale seemed to have gained spiritual intelligence and was awakened.</p><p>He was stunned for a moment before he roared angrily, “Bazhun’an, you dirty…” Roar!”</p><p>Water Ghost responded with another dragon roar.</p><p>The power of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon came through the Green Dragon Gate and entered the body of this Upanishad demi-saint.</p><p>Endless demonic aura gushed out of Water Ghost’s body. He transformed into a dragon and was no longer only an illusion.</p><p>His body had no fixed form to begin with. At this moment, he had turned into a stream of water that was black in color. The dragon scales floated about on his body and turned him into a huge black water dragon.</p><p>Just as Wangze Holy Emperor’s chaotic heavenly power gathered, the black water dragon controlled by the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon swept out.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The demonic aura covered the area, and the dragon tail resembled a black wall that could block one part of the world. It stood in front of Xu Xiaoshou and Lei Xi’er and blocked the Holy Emperor’s attack with its physical strength.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The space exploded.</p><p>The Desolate Inferno Domain was destroyed by the violent power.</p><p>With just one collision, the ruins of one of the nine extreme grounds was completely wiped out. No traces of a volcano were left and even the lava was wiped out by the terrifying power.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>All the spectators from the First Hall of Sins gasped.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon had returned?</p><p>It had parasitized the Upanishad demi-saint Water Ghost when it used a ghost beast host body?</p><p>“How could this be…” Rao Yaoyao’s eyes dimmed as she muttered in shock.</p><p>However, the reality was far more shocking than that.</p><p>When Wangze Holy Emperor’s attack failed and he wanted to use another spell…</p><p>The red sky at the Vermillion Bird gate in the south was already reflected in the eyes of the people from the First Hall of Sins and the Desolate Inferno Domain.</p><p>Under the hands of a blood-orange figure that floated in the air.</p><p>“Sha sha…”</p><p>The phantoms of seven blood trees that blotted out the sky swept across. The tree crowns rustled, and the smell of blood flooded the air.</p><p>The arrival of the Holy Emperor seemed to announce that the future of the Blood Sea had arrived.</p><p>“Is that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man?”</p><p>Some people recognized the strange figure, but they couldn’t distinguish the current Five Decays of Heaven and Man from the one that was crushed by Water Ghost.</p><p>On the west side of the White Tiger gate.</p><p>An ear-piercing sound rang out, and a gigantic Frost Ferret flew over from tens of thousands of miles away.</p><p>Its body was snow-white, and its ghost beast wings were like the wings of Kun Peng. It descended from the sky, but there were huge green chains wrapped around its body.</p><p>When it came to this world, the world seemed to turn into a prison.</p><p>Everyone looked at the Frost Ferret and felt afraid. They felt that they had fallen into a boundless sea of misery. They had become bits of food in its belly and could not escape.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>“Isn’t that the ice-type ghost beast that Elder Yan toyed with? Why did it mutate? Did it also carry the aura of a Holy Emperor?”</p><p>The boundless sea of fire spread through the air.</p><p>A slightly disheveled figure with all four limbs shackled flew straight towards Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>However, at the last moment, this figure changed directions and poured all of its power into Lei Xi’er’s body.</p><p>“Pfft…</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s body ignited and the white flames almost seared her to death.</p><p>However, in the next second, the Holy Emperor’s aura spread out.</p><p>Lei Xi’er woke up due to the pain in her eyes and her Ultimate Life Demon Physique was completely released. The life force within tens of thousands of miles was sucked dry.</p><p>Her state that had been reduced to the lowest instantly returned to its peak.</p><p>Lei Xi’er raised her hands and looked at the searing white flames that Mu Zixi had envied for a long time. She felt the pain that Xu Xiaoshou experienced and her expression was strange.</p><p>Parasitic?</p><p>However, that will did not dominate her, instead it would let her lead?</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Lei Xi’er, who was the only one who did not understand, stood rooted to the</p><p>ground.</p><p>In an instant, the secondary plane door opened under her feet. She was teleported to the extreme north, the Black Tortoise Gate.</p><p>Water Ghost who was parasitized by the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon actually had the strength to fight with the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon for its will.</p><p>“Get lost, I’ll lead!”</p><p>“Mortal, what do you know?”</p><p>“Do you know how to open the Four Divine Pillars? If you know, then you do it!”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was silent for a moment. Water Ghost seized the opportunity and used the secondary plane door to send its powerful black water dragon to the Green Dragon Gate.</p><p>He activated the secondary plane door from afar and drew the power of the Holy Emperors that were scattered around the four gates of Abyss Island and linked the Desolate Inferno Domain to Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>Just like Wangze Holy Emperor, even the Inner Island’s Third Ancestor of the White Vein and the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon couldn’t act recklessly.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou was different!</p><p>He was from the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy!</p><p>As long as he borrowed the power of the four Holy Emperors, he would be the only existence on this Abyss Island who could kill Gods and Emperors!</p><p>After he opened Patriarch Wuji’s Divine Array Wheel and infused it with Holy Power, Water Ghost endured the pain of being possessed and roared.</p><p>“Four Divine Pillars, open!”</p><p>Amidst a loud bang, at the four gates of Abyss Island.</p><p>The black water dragon from the Green Dragon Gate to the east, the green-chained frost ferret from the White Tiger Gate to the west, the blood-red sky from the Vermilion Bird Gate to the south, and the nameless sea of fire from the Black Tortoise Gate to the north. Four pillars of Holy Emperor light shot out and entered Xu Xiaoshou’s body.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was immersed in the pain of power, found the compass to guide him in an instant. However he was hit by four violent forces and went into a cultivation deviation.</p><p>However, he was already used to being possessed!</p><p>He woke up from his slumber and was revived from the dead silence.</p><p>The moment Xu Xiaoshou opened his eyes, the power of the Holy Emperor pressed down on Abyss Island. The world fell into darkness, and the full moon hung high in the sky.</p><p>With a whoosh, he rose to the top of the ninety-nine-story tower.</p><p>When the full moon appeared in the sky, Xu Xiaoshou’s clothes had been completely blackened by the boundless devilish energy.</p><p>He stood at the top of the lone building and looked down at Rao Wangze coldly.</p><p>“Rao Wangze, I have broken the Si Wu Formation.”</p><p>“Now, how should you deal with me?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
