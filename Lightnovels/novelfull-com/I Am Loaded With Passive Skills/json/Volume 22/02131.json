(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“Sword Saint Rao is at a disadvantage?”</p><p>The battle situation changed, and a commotion broke out.</p><p>No one expected Xu Xiaoshou to turn the situation around in an instant and even use such a killing move on Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>If such a considerable number of Fire Seed were to be detonated, it would probably blow up not only Rao Yaoyao but also the entire Land Realm of the First Hall of Sins, right?</p><p>NO!</p><p>The Fire Seed was condensed from the power of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>If it exploded, half of the Abyss Island would be destroyed.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou has gone crazy!” Everyone was terrified and felt that their lives were in danger.</p><p>Perhaps, Xu Xiaoshou was a little arrogant after obtaining the power of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>But now, it seemed that he really did have the right and confidence to be arrogant?</p><p>The pressure of the Holy Emperor’s power was not for show. Rao Yaoyao truly felt like she was about to die after her neck was grabbed.</p><p>However, before she could do anything, a loud shout came from the back of the battlefield.</p><p>“Greater Teleportation! ”</p><p>A Celestial Scroll was formed under Rao Yaoyao’s feet. Xu Xiaoshou had lost his target before he could exert any force in his palm.</p><p>The tens of thousands of Fire Seed that the Flame Python had slashed down had even penetrated the afterimage left behind by Rao Yaoyao and blasted downwards.</p><p>“Oh no, the attack is coming this way!”</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>On the ruins of the First Hall of Sins, everyone scattered like birds and beasts, wishing they could grow wings and avoid the Fire Seed.</p><p>Even Dao Qiongcang felt his scalp go numb from Xu Xiaoshou’s ten thousand Fire Seed attack.</p><p>After saving people, he did not dare to stop for a moment.</p><p>“Si Wu Formation, activate!”</p><p>The three hundred and sixty-five Void Suppression Stele scattered on Abyss Island, as well as the spiritual light and holy light emitted by the eight cores, trembled at the same time.</p><p>However, one of the cores, the Ember Heart, was swallowed by Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>Moreover, Xu Xiaoshou had left the Desolate Inferno Domain and the position of the core of the great array.</p><p>Naturally, it became the most obvious flaw of the Si Wu Formation, causing its circulation to stop for a moment.</p><p>At this moment!</p><p>Tens of thousands of Fire Seed had already split open and landed on the First Hall of Sins, looking as if they were about to explode!</p><p>“This strength…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s hands trembled.</p><p>However, he had already calculated this. The divine Sinan moved and swallowed the energy of the supreme saint calamity to temporarily enter the Si Wu Formation, allowing the great array to operate again.</p><p>“Great Annihilation Technique!”</p><p>At the same time as the Fire Seed exploded, the high-altitude saint calamity broke through and the Heavenly Ancestor Light descended, enveloping all the Fire Seed.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The sound of the explosion only had time to ring out in everyone’s ears, but its power did not spread out. It was intercepted and erased by Dao Qiongcang and the Si Wu Formation.</p><p>“We survived?”</p><p>All the people who were fleeing stopped in their tracks. Their faces were pale, and they were still terrified.</p><p>Just a moment ago, they were halfway into the Gates of Hell and almost met the god of death. They knew that if it wasn’t for Hallmaster Dao, they would all be buried here.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, you are indeed a hindrance.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around coldly. He wasn’t surprised that he had lost Rao Yaoyao as his target, nor was he surprised that his Fire Seed attack had been intercepted.</p><p>What surprised him was that Rao Yaoyao hadn’t escaped by her own means but by Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>He could even extinguish the Fire Seed condensed from the power of the Holy Emperor…</p><p>As long as Dao Qiongcang was still alive and stayed behind, who could hurt Rao Yaoyao?</p><p>If this Great Mage in the back row wasn’t eliminated, Rao Yaoyao would be essentially untouchable and that was equivalent to having unlimited life!</p><p>Facing the cold gaze, Dao Qiongcang calmly glanced at him from the corner of his eye and said,</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao, I told you not to face him head-on. If you can’t beat him, you</p><p>need to stall.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao, who had been teleported far away, clutched the scar on her neck. Her face was pale and she did not make a sound.</p><p>After Dao Qiongcang finished speaking, Water Ghost’s voice immediately sounded from within his body.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what do you want?”</p><p>“I’m still here. Let’s fight Rao Yaoyao first!”</p><p>Obviously, Water Ghost had seen through Xu Xiaoshou’s intention to kill Dao Qiongcang first, then kill Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>Then, would this kid pretend not to know that he was in Dao Qiongcang’s body, or would he intentionally kill him as well? This was not a multiple-choice question!</p><p>There was only one answer!</p><p>Water Ghost felt that the current Xu Xiaoshou was too uncontrollable.</p><p>He hated the feeling of not having control over the situation and having to submit to someone else.</p><p>If he could turn back time, he would never follow his plan but instead, put his life above Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts.</p><p>“You burden.” Xu Xiaoshou sneered.</p><p>“…” Water Ghost was like Rao Yaoyao, who was rendered speechless by his rebuttal and was left with a heart full of slander.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you can’t touch me. Although this Water Ghost is hateful, your power has a time limit and will eventually run out. Therefore, you must spare Water Ghost’s life.” Dao Qiongcang laughed. He had a clear grasp of the situation.</p><p>Taking in the Water Ghost was equivalent to giving himself another life.</p><p>Because of Xu Xiaoshou’s unpredictable behavior, the Water Ghost did not dare to seal his ability again.</p><p>After all, he was also afraid of death.</p><p>With this, he would be in an invincible position.</p><p>“You’re right. My power will run out. I’ll need Water Ghost to become a Saint to cover for me.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded his head seriously and changed the topic. “But how are you so sure that you can control me just because you can control that useless Water Ghost?”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>In the end, Water Ghost only cursed silently and did not say anything.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was still smiling and asked suspiciously, “Oh? Can you save him?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed maniacally when he heard that. He clenched his fist and the sea of fire boiled. His spiritual sense spread across Abyss Island and covered everything.</p><p>“Everyone’s life and death are decided by me. Who can’t be killed and who can’t be saved?”</p><p>This extremely arrogant voice was transmitted with the power of the Holy Emperor, causing everyone to feel uncomfortable.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Just as he was about to mock him, Xu Xiaoshou spun his feet and a huge Power Upanishad Formation appeared.</p><p>This array diagram was complicated. It contained the array formation of the universe, the power of Path Principles, and the mysteries of the divine secrets….lt was almost like a weakened version of the Celestial Scroll!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
