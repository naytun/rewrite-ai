(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>When the saint calamity tore through the sky and dropped the first calamity and thunder on the Desolate Inferno Domain, the world that was covered by dark clouds lit up.</p><p>All the discussions stopped. Everyone’s hearts tightened. They hid their auras to prevent themselves from being targeted by the saint calamity and they focused on the phenomenon.</p><p>Such a saint calamity was a rare occurrence, so how could they not watch it with all their full concentration?</p><p>In the sky above the Desolate Inferno Domain, Bai Lian had already seized the opportunity to escape to avoid being trapped at the center of the saint calamity.</p><p>Only Water Ghost was left, and he could still adjust his golden beast mask elegantly and calmly under the onslaught of the saint calamity.</p><p>When the tribulation descended, he summoned the Original Sealing Spear and the Sea God’s Trident and held one in each hand. His lips curled up slightly.</p><p>“Then let’s use this grand catastrophe to bring the curtains down on a good show on Abyss Island!”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>As he faced the purple lightning, Water Ghost’s spear and trident moved together to meet the challenge.</p><p>However, at the same time, everyone saw that Dao Qiongcang had sprang into action.</p><p>He also leaped up and stood beside Water Ghost. They walked shoulder to shoulder and entered the center of the saint calamity.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The thunder calamity struck the two of them.</p><p>Water Ghost who transcended the tribulation was supposed to be shattered by the purple lightning, turned into ink rain and his form reshaped itself. Dao Qiongcang, the one who intervened, was also blasted into ancient characters and reshaped too.</p><p>Both of them were fine!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded. While they were shocked by their strength, they also vaguely understood Dao Qiongcang’s method.</p><p>Provoke the saint calamity and cause a qualitative change?</p><p>As expected, the moment the saint calamity sensed that someone had ‘helped’ the person who transcended the tribulation, it immediately became furious.</p><p>The void rumbled loudly. The second tribulation, that should only consist of two bolts of lightning, turned into two hundred bolts of lightning!</p><p>“200 bolts of dark ember divine lightning?”</p><p>Li Fugui’s eyes almost popped out.</p><p>The saint calamity was enraged, so when it doubled its attack, it was considered good. Ten times was too ridiculous, but it was still acceptable.</p><p>However, once it sensed that there was an outsider who helped the person to transcend the tribulation, it would immediately become a hundred times angrier. Who could overcome this?</p><p>The person who transcended the tribulation probably did not even dare to let outsiders know where the location of the transcend the tribulation was!</p><p>“This Dao Qiongcang is very calculative…”</p><p>Seated on the dragon’s head, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes also flickered.</p><p>Elder Dao the Flamboyant’s move was actually not brilliant. He needed to use his own skills.</p><p>After all, after being targeted by the saint calamity, it was basically equivalent to living and dying with Water Ghost.</p><p>“If it was Jiang Buyi, I’m afraid he wouldn’t even dare to fight!”</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang is too ferocious. What other methods did he have to block the saint calamity?”</p><p>“After all, at the late-stage of the saint calamity, Dao Qiongcang would be blasted into a strange state, and even the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation will be forced out…That would really be a loss!”</p><p>Just as Xu Xiaoshou thought about this, he saw hundreds of thunderbolts that rained down after the saint calamity was angered.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The one who transcended the tribulation did not even have time to breathe as the third tribulation followed immediately after the second tribulation.</p><p>There were a total of 300 bolts of dark ember divine thunder and one White Demon Heart Tribulation.</p><p>“A heart tribulation appeared in the third tribulation, and it’s even the White Demon Heart Tribulation…” The people who watched the ceremony were speechless.</p><p>Even Li Fugui was stunned into silence.</p><p>This kind of heart tribulation would only appear in the late-stage of the saint calamity.</p><p>Since the third tribulation had arrived, didn’t that mean that Water Ghost and Dao Qiongcang would have to endure the torment of the heart tribulation in the subsequent tribulations?</p><p>There were still 129,500 more calamities before the supreme saint calamity would be completely passed. How could he pass it?</p><p>“Boom boom boom…”</p><p>The thunder calamity followed, one after the other.</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators in the ruins of the First Hall of Sins finally understood what Li Fugui meant by ‘no time to breathe’.</p><p>The dense thunder calamity not only submerged Water Ghost and Dao Qiongcang, but also turned the entire Desolate Inferno Domain volcano into dust.</p><p>The lava surged and before it could splash about, it was also blasted into nothingness, that left no chance for the person who transcended the tribulation or the site that transcended the tribulation to survive.</p><p>As the deafening thunder boomed continuously, the two people in the center of the saint calamity were the perfect epitome of the term ‘fearless’.</p><p>They were able to withstand the thunder calamity while they fought with each other.</p><p>The Water-type Upanishad and the Celestial Scroll flashed by frequently.</p><p>All kinds of spiritual techniques and Divine Secrets interweaved and exploded amidst the chaotic thunder.</p><p>They exchanged blows without mercy.</p><p>“This is too exaggerated!”</p><p>Bai Lian stood in midair, as he retreated further away.</p><p>When he witnessed this scene, he could hardly suppress the shock in his heart.</p><p>To be able to enter the Holy Palace and wield the authority of the Infernal lineage, he was naturally a genius.</p><p>However, a genius like him couldn’t be compared to the Ten High Nobles Dao</p><p>Qiongcang and the genius Water-type Upanishad, Yu Mo.</p><p>These were monsters!</p><p>They were too relentless. This was the supreme saint calamity, not a game!</p><p>However, despite the difference in their realms, the supreme saint calamity was still the supreme saint calamity.</p><p>As the intensity of the thunder calamity increased, under the continuous bombardment, the conditions of the duo quickly deteriorated. Water Ghost’s weakness emerged.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang seized the opportunity and swept the divine Sinan across the stars.</p><p>“Great Killing Technique!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>As the lightning flashed, everyone saw Water Ghost’s spatial gate open and he was about to be struck by the divine starlight.</p><p>“Water Ghost can’t beat him. He’s going to lose.”</p><p>On the dragon’s head, Xu Xiaoshou’s Perception was clearer. He knew that Dao Qiongcang wanted to destroy Water Ghost in the early stages of the saint calamity.</p><p>In this way, the supreme saint calamity would lose its target, the original one who transcended the tribulation, and it would naturally disappear.</p><p>At this critical moment, Water Ghost seemed to have a trump card. He opened his mouth as if he wanted to spit something out.</p><p>However, his movements suddenly stopped, and the spiritual source in his entire body retracted and left only a protective spirit shield. He even deliberately shifted his position.</p><p>“What are you doing? Are you not going to counterattack and just wait for death?” Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded.</p><p>Under the saint calamity, Dao Qiongcang was slightly dazed, but he could not retract his attack..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
