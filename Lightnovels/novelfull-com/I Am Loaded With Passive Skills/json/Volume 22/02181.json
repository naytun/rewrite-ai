Mei Siren, however, could see it clearly and was completely astonished.</p><p>Everyone knew that the imagery of the Heart Sword Technique could not be changed!</p><p>Mei Siren had seen Xu Xiaoshou’s strong imagery, which was the imagery of Sword God Gu Louying.</p><p>Regardless of the strength of his current realm, the hierarchy of the imagery alone allowed him to almost outclass ninety-nine percent of ancient swordsmen of the present era.</p><p>But in this ‘Demons Under Eyes,’ imagery changed with a single strike!</p><p>Mei Siren quickly looked to the side at Bazhun’an and, in a few words, described the entire battle process before asking, “From Black Heaven, Silver Moon, Solitary Tower, Back View…”</p><p>“It transformed into stepping on the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, seven blood trees on the back, surrounded by a white sea of flames, a cyan purgatory above the head, and a Berserk Giant with two charred arms…”</p><p>“This is clearly the Heavenly Unravel of the Heart Sword Technique! Did you teach him?”</p><p>After Mei Siren finished speaking, he still could not believe it.</p><p>He knew that Bazhun’an simply did not have the time to teach Xu Xiaoshou the sword. Otherwise, Mei Siren would not have had this opportunity.</p><p>Leaving aside whether Bazhun’an had the time…</p><p>Even if he wanted to teach, wouldn’t the ancient swordsman in this world have to possess the talent to learn it?</p><p>Fringe Moon Immortal City’s Xiao Kongtong, the sole disciple of Bazhun’an and one of the Seven Sword Deities, unquestionably possessed exceptional talent in the Way of the Sword.</p><p>Even he could not do this technique!</p><p>Did Xu Xiaoshou master it?</p><p>When, where, and by what means did he learn it?</p><p>Mei Siren had too many questions in his mind. If he could get the answers and spread this technique worldwide, it would be a blessing for swordsmen.</p><p>At that time, a new era for ancient swordsmen could truly begin!</p><p>The Heart Sword Technique would undoubtedly lead the trend of the Ancient Sword Technique, becoming the foremost among the Nine Major Sword Techniques!</p><p>Thinking of this, how could Mei Siren, who loved being a teacher, conceal his excitement?</p><p>“Present Gods and Buddhas, Heavenly Unravel?”</p><p>On the side, Bazhun’an frowned slightly, holding a slightly reserved opinion about Master Siren’s statement, saying, “Did you say that from the imagery of the Sword God Gu Louying, it turned into the imagery of the Four Small Holy Emperors?”</p><p>“This kind of demotion, how can it be considered Heavenly Unravel? Shouldn’t it be more appropriate to say that the Heart Sword Technique has</p><p>‘self-concealed’?”</p><p>“Did Xu Xiaoshou weaken it for you?”</p><p>Bazhun’an’s face showed a hint of suspicion.</p><p>He had a certain confidence in Xu Xiaoshou’s talent: indeed, he could bear the weight of the word “passable.”</p><p>Therefore, he simply did not believe that Xu Xiaoshou could control Wangze Holy Emperor after reversing the Heart Sword Technique with Heavenly Unravel. “Not at all!”</p><p>Mei Siren urgently responded, almost hitting Bazhun’an’s forehead with his folding fan. He gritted his teeth and said, “You should be able to see that Xu Xiaoshou has mastered Gu Louying’s imagery.”</p><p>“But before, he only restored it by relying on the description of the legend of the Sword God, still in the imitation stage.”</p><p>“But he surpassed the imagery of the Four Small… ah, Four Great Holy Emperors with extraordinary aura and demeanor, resembling a grandmaster of the Heart Sword Technique..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
