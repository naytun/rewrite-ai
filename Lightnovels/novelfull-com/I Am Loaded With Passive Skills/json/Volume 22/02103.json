Soon, the earth trembled, and from it burst forth a beam of holy light.</p><p>“Treasure!”</p><p>“This is undoubtedly a supreme treasure of the Saint Stage!”</p><p>Countless faces were awestruck.</p><p>Their primary purpose for coming to Abyss Island was to find the foundational roots of Saint Ascension.</p><p>Clearly, this holy object that had emerged from the Azure Marsh was closely related to their mission.</p><p>Once obtained, there was a possibility of uncovering an opportunity for sanctification.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind sparked like lightning.</p><p>After all, he had spent time within the Divine Oracle and knew of the Si Wu Formation, the Nine Cores, and the role of the Void Suppression Stele.</p><p>Was this object not one of the Nine Cores?</p><p>This was the treasure that the Holy Divine Palace had buried to suppress the island, much like the Dragon Apricot.</p><p>Had Dao Qiongcang been here before and made a contract with the island’s treasures?</p><p>“Was it intentional, or was it a coincidence? Why the Azure Marsh…”</p><p>There was no time for contemplation.</p><p>The holy light that had erupted from the Azure Marsh had shattered the saint calamity, revealing an ancient castle-like holy weapon.</p><p>“God Suppression Castle!”</p><p>When the Water Ghost finally recognized this ancient holy weapon, the smile on his face froze.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, even the appearance of a holy weapon would not stop the saint calamity.</p><p>But the God Suppression Castle was an exception!</p><p>It was once owned by a god slayer called Ran Ming, and possessed unparalleled suppressive force.</p><p>The God Suppression Castle had even suppressed the power of the ancestral source released by demi-saints in the past.</p><p>So, how could it not avert a mere calamity of a demi-saint?</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang held the divine Sinan in his hand with graceful composure.</p><p>With a single word, the ancient God Suppression Castle rapidly expanded, covering the entire Azure Marsh and crashing down on the Water Ghost’s head.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The void trembled.</p><p>The shockwave from the explosion in the Azure Marsh could even be heard in the distant First Hall of Sins, where everyone watched the battle through the spirit mirror.</p><p>“Oh my!”</p><p>“Help, help!”</p><p>“Ugh!”</p><p>Countless people were blown off their feet.</p><p>It was not because the shockwave was too powerful. It was caused by simply looking at the scene in the spirit mirror.</p><p>The suppressive force from the explosion was so intense that it even affected observers from afar.</p><p>When the actual shockwave reached them, everyone felt deafened, and the power within them was briefly suppressed.</p><p>“Is he dead?”</p><p>“Did the God Suppression Castle kill the Water Ghost?”</p><p>Fortunately, this wave of destruction did not harm many people since it occurred away from the central Arena.</p><p>After everyone picked themselves up, they were left in disbelief.</p><p>The Water Ghost, the mastermind behind the entire scheme on Abyss Island, disappeared just like that. Was it not somewhat anticlimactic?</p><p>“He’s not dead!”</p><p>Above the Azure Marsh, protected by the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, Xu Xiaoshou, who was unaffected by the shockwave and suppressive force, had a glimmer in his eyes.</p><p>With his “Perception,” he could see the moment when the God Suppression Castle landed, and he noticed the Water Ghost opening a secondary plane door at the last instant.</p><p>Of course, the Water Ghost did not use the secondary plane door to engulf the God Suppression Castle controlled by Dao Qiongcang. Instead, he was devoured.</p><p>“Where did he go?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had yet to find an answer when he saw Dao Qiongcang looking toward the direction of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, in one swift movement, soared above the site of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>Both of them had a much better grasp of the situation, perception range, and abilities than the inexperienced Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>In the First Hall of Sins, the Water Ghost held a secondary plane door in one hand and the Sea God’s Trident in the other, raising both divine instruments high.</p><p>He had no intention of attempting sanctification!</p><p>It was as if all his actions before were merely a smokescreen, concealing his true intentions.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, if you could expect that Azure Marsh is my last resort, how could I not have anticipated what’s on your mind?”</p><p>“Had I truly underestimated you, how could I dare, on this very day, to plot against you?”</p><p>He spoke in a low voice, and the secondary plane door in his hand suddenly emitted a bright light, and an ancient phantom door appeared.</p><p>“Spell Forbidden Barrier!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had just arrived, and before he could react, he felt his holy power vanish.</p><p>What was this?</p><p>Had the Water Ghost connected to the Spell Forbidden Barrier within the Inner Island, drawing its power out?</p><p>As the realization dawned on him, a look of shock, however subtle, finally crept onto Dao Qiongcang’s face.</p><p>He gazed at the Water Ghost.</p><p>The Water Ghost was smiling. A shallow smile.</p><p>“My enigmatic and unpredictable Hallmaster Dao, have you ever considered where you would meet your demise?”</p><p>“You could use the full power of the secondary plane door? In the Higher Void State?” Dao Qiongcang could not help but ask.</p><p>“Who spread the ‘rule’ that only demi-saints can fully activate the secondary plane door? And who showed that Water-type Upanishad could break that ‘rule’ and barely activate the secondary plane door?” The Water Ghost’s lips curled into a grin as he tilted his head, his face slowly unveiled a look of revelation.</p><p>“Oh, it was me.”</p><p>He answered his own question before looking at Dao Qiongcang, whose face had turned ashen. Then, he struck with the Sea God’s Trident.</p><p>Sizzling sounds filled the air as the dense water-type power, seizing the moment when Dao Qiongcang’s ability was sealed, engulfed the entire Abyss Island.</p><p>“Deep sea!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
