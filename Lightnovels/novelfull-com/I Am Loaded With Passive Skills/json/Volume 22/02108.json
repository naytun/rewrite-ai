(2)</h1><p>Chapter 2108: An Inhumane Water Ghost! Inhumane Bai Liani! (2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio     Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>The relationship between the Holy Palace and the Holy Divine Palace was not as good as it was rumored to be. One was in charge of the cultivation of Saints and the other was in charge of the security of the continent. They did not interfere in each other’s affairs.</p><p>In a sense, these two factions were on the same level, so there were too many open and also covert conflicts of interest. They were all fights that could not be made known publicly.</p><p>As one of the five great authorities of the Holy Palace, Bai Lian knew very well how many obstacles he had placed on the Holy Divine Palace over the years.</p><p>If he was Dao Qiongcang, he would come over to take a look…</p><p>So, the Holy Palace’s opponent and the dark faction’s enemy stood together; they were accomplices. Why don’t we destroy them first before we learn the truth?</p><p>As to how to give an explanation after or how to settle the compensation after the ‘misunderstanding’…</p><p>Just compensate them.</p><p>However, no matter how he compensated, it was impossible to exchange one life for another. Therefore, if he dared to drop it first, it was equivalent to giving it to him for nothing!</p><p>In the face of life and death, Bai Lian wasn’t like the other explosive masters of the Infernal lineage at all. Instead, he was very calm.</p><p>He spoke first. Even if he had really colluded with the Saint Servant, Dao Qiongcang would have to wait until he had investigated the matter before he could act.</p><p>And now…</p><p>When one looked at the situation, Dao Qiongcang still had to save him!</p><p>“Bai Lian?”</p><p>After Dao Qiongcang attacked the First Hall of Sins, he flashed to the sky above the Desolate Inferno Domain to pursue Water Ghost. When he saw this person…</p><p>To be honest, he was a little shocked.</p><p>This was an absolute variable that exceeded his calculations!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had thought that the Holy Palace’s Infernal lineage would collude with the Saint Servant.</p><p>After all, Sang Qiye had not been executed until now because of the pressure exerted by the Holy Palace.</p><p>However, Dao Qiongcang didn’t even dare to imagine that the Holy Palace and the Saint Servant would work together so openly!</p><p>Did they want to die?</p><p>Bai Lian was very tactful. He explained before he even saw him.</p><p>When Dao Qiongcang rushed over, he caught these words and was unable to make a move.</p><p>But this was better than making a move!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was slightly relieved. He realized that the situation might not have developed for the worst.</p><p>But his eyes were too sharp!</p><p>He could clearly see that Water Ghost had flashed to the sky above the Desolate Inferno Domain. After he received the choice of one out of three options, a hint of surprise that did not seem fake flashed across his eyes.</p><p>Then, Water Ghost glanced at Bai Lian, who was in the midst of getting dressed. His expression became extremely funny, as if he was angered.</p><p>“Still putting on an act? He is Dao Qiongcang!”</p><p>In an instant, Bai Lian felt as if he had been struck by lightning.</p><p>A stream of killing intent immediately surged from Dao Qiongcang’s body.</p><p>“Coincidence?”</p><p>How could it be a coincidence!</p><p>He knew that Dao Qiongcang was the creator of countless ‘coincidences’. How could he believe that such a sensitive encounter at this moment could be a mere coincidence?</p><p>“F*ck you…”</p><p>Before Bai Lian could even curse Water Ghost, he had already sensed the killing intent that emerged from Dao Qiongcang’s body. His expression changed drastically. “Dao Palace… F*ck!”</p><p>There was no time to explain!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had definitely made a move on purpose!</p><p>It was said to be one out of three options, but there were actually four options. Dao Qiongcang was not a child, he wanted all of them!</p><p>When the divine Sinan turned, a thought incarnation jumped out of Dao</p><p>Qiongcang’s body and instantly flew toward Rao Yaoyao above the Fallen</p><p>Abyss. It blocked the semi-saint person from the Sea God’s Trident’s attack.</p><p>“Divine Thirty-Six Form, Great Shift Technique!”</p><p>At the same time, in the Forest of Miracles, the secondary plane door above Situ Yongren’s head transformed and countless black swords rained down. They were about to stab down and kill him when a Celestial Scroll unfolded under his feet and teleported him away from the spot.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s main body, which was already close to the Desolate Inferno Domain and Water Ghost, naturally wouldn’t stay idle.</p><p>His true body flashed away, and the star dipper on the divine Sinan moved again. It drew out two streaks of starlight that shot toward Bai Lian and Water Ghost at the same time.</p><p>“Divine Thirty-Six Form, Great Killing Technique!” Everyone was stunned by such a murderous move.</p><p>Water Ghost laughed.</p><p>He smiled calmly.</p><p>There would be a delay if one wanted to be fully protected. At this time, Water Ghost’s blood had successfully fused into the semi-saint person.</p><p>Furthermore, he did not even want to resist Dao Qiongcang’s attack. It was as if the attack was made of paper.</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao, you are muddle-headed!”</p><p>Bai Lian cried out in sorrow. He knew that he and Dao Qiongcang had been used as tools, even though the latter had more or less done it on purpose.</p><p>However, the demi-saint’s attack had already been launched. It was like an arrow that had been shot from a bow and could not be retracted.</p><p>There was no time to dodge and he could only take it head-on!</p><p>If it was anyone else, they would definitely die under this move, but who was Bai Lian?</p><p>It was true that his realm was not high.</p><p>However, Bai Lian had his Supreme Master Mu Ling, Grandmaster Long Rongzhi, and the entire Holy Palace as his support!</p><p>On the surface, he was at the same level as Dao Qiongcang. Why would he be afraid of a mere Hallmaster Dao?</p><p>He was a little scared…</p><p>However, even with all his trump cards in hand, he, Bai Lian could not even withstand a single blow!</p><p>With a shift of his spiritual senses, he activated the Holy Blood in his soul space and swallowed it automatically.</p><p>Without any side effects or any power increase period, the Holy Blood instantly pulled Bai Lian’s aura to the Saint Stage.</p><p>“Nine Dragons Burning the Ancestor, activate!”</p><p>Bai Lian, who seemed to be in a panic stricken state, knew that he had no choice but to resist, and his expression turned incomparably cold.</p><p>With a shout, the world rumbled and the already unstable Desolate Inferno Domain ignited.</p><p>The volcano erupted behind him, and thick lava spewed into the sky and turned into nine incomparably solid lava dragons that covered the sky and melted everything.</p><p>At this moment, the Desolate Inferno Domain was Bai Lian’s greatest support.</p><p>With such a favorable terrain, his combat strength increased by more than ten times.</p><p>“Dragon Melting Realm!”</p><p>At the same time that the Saint Statue materialized, the infernal white flame swirled for thousands of miles as it surged from the ground and soared into the sky.</p><p>Unlike Elder Sang and Xu Xiaoshou’s Dragon Melting Realm, they didn’t completely close up and form a barrier.</p><p>Instead, it fused with the lava in the void and formed a huge red and white alchemy cauldron. It trapped the two rays of light from Dao Qiongcang’s Great</p><p>Killing Technique..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
