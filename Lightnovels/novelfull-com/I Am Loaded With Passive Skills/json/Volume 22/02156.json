(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Outsiders couldn’t imitate it, it was Bazhun’an’s sword!</p><p>But Bazhun’an…</p><p>Before they could even think about it, Rao Yaoyao and Dao Qiongcang saw the source of the sword cries at the same time.</p><p>The cold Dark Iron Sword that had long been forgotten by everyone!</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s pupils dilated. He really wanted to summon the departed Xiao Qi and scream. Why wasn’t this thing recorded in the battlefield information?</p><p>He keenly sensed that he was blocked by the power of the Holy Emperor?</p><p>That’s right, he could no longer interfere!</p><p>“Ming Yi…”</p><p>But he had to intervene!</p><p>How could he let Xu Xiaoshou take control of the Si Wu Formation?</p><p>As this thought flashed through his mind, the sword cries chimed out a warning. The cold Dark Iron Sword trembled and ejected a silver sword energy.</p><p>At this moment, the world seemed to have slowed down.</p><p>Everyone couldn’t help but look at the sword and the sword energy. The distance and space were of no consequence as they could actually see it!</p><p>The sword energy was very faint, very faint.</p><p>At first, it was as fragile as a strand of hair; it trembled and seemed about to scatter.</p><p>After it brushed against the sword body, it became as strong as the sun in the courtyard.</p><p>When it walked in the world, it gathered the power of thousands of living creatures and dead souls to ‘observe’ and plunder the reality of its ‘name’… It slashed through the space time and broke thousands of laws!</p><p>In an instant, the sword energy turned into sword cognition and reached the tip of Dao Qiongcang’s nose.</p><p>“Bazhun’an’s sword!”</p><p>Finally, someone from the First Hall of Sins shouted out excitedly.</p><p>“I can’t bear to look at this…”</p><p>At the same time, Rao Yaoyao and Dao Qiongcang realized that they had been attacked.</p><p>The Witness Sword Technique created by Bazhun’an was too powerful!</p><p>He comprehended that the famed sword could gather Heaven and Earth’s Nurturing of Fame to nourish it and it would become stronger each day. He used the eyes of a swordsman to do this sword observation and created something out of nothing and then observed the profoundness.</p><p>Now, his strength had evolved once again.</p><p>At first, he saw that the sword energy was weak; it was almost as if he had not made a move.</p><p>The subsequent evolution process was actually handed over to be completed by the people of the world.</p><p>The more people who were there for the sword observation, the stronger the sword energy would be!</p><p>The more people who recognized him, the more famous he would be!</p><p>And ‘observe’ and ‘name’ were the foundations of the Way of the Sword that the young Bazhun’an mastered when he defeated the five regions!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s body tensed up and his mind focused.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao, who had been on the alert, felt that her mission had arrived.</p><p>No wonder…</p><p>No wonder he asked me to protect him.</p><p>It turned out that it was really a plan to lure the tiger away from the mountain and kill Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>The force of the sword energy was menacing. It seemed invincible, but in fact, no one controlled it.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had already reached the realm of a sword saint. She was already on guard, so she commanded the Cang Godhood Sword to fly toward Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>Bazhun’an’s sword energy was well versed in the path of the Space-Time Transition.</p><p>Although Rao Yaoyao wasn’t good at the Fantasy Sword Technique, she had never fallen behind in the first realm of cultivation. The sword energy was right in front of her.</p><p>Xuan Cang tilted a little.</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>The terrifying sword cognition that almost split Dao Qiongcang in half was turned around by the shift in the power of the 3000 Sword Styles that flew out of Dao Qiongcang’s right ear.</p><p>Half a strand of hair fell.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang leaned back.</p><p>The flow of time seemed to have returned to normal.</p><p>An uproar broke out in the ruins of the First Hall of Sins and the din was shocking.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao was almost killed?</p><p>The one who attacked was his old rival, Bazhun’an?</p><p>This was big news!</p><p>Everyone pursued the sword cognition as it flew by. They were dismayed to see that the sword cognition that brushed past their ears didn’t slash back and forth, instead it flew diagonally towards a certain place…</p><p>It flew across the sky.</p><p>It flew across the land.</p><p>It flew towards the Forest of Miracles.</p><p>The power contained within it seemed to be for a single use only.</p><p>Midway through the flight, there was no longer any Space-Time Transition or other peculiarities. After the collision, the sword cognition lost its power and degenerated to only sword energy.</p><p>Thus, even the spiritual realm and direction were very clear.</p><p>The sword energy finally flew out of the Forest of Miracles and into the body of a man whose head was lowered.</p><p>“Not dead!”</p><p>Such a weak noob. Although his realm was hidden, it was definitely not just at the Acquired Stage, but it looked like he was about to die.</p><p>He had actually absorbed the power of the sword energy and had not been cut in half!</p><p>After a pause, everyone suddenly realized that there might be more than one answer.</p><p>“Him!”</p><p>“His, his hand…”</p><p>Someone pointed at the figure in the spirit mirror and stuttered the word ‘He’ for a long time, and could not complete his sentence.</p><p>However, everyone knew what he wanted to express, and they all leaned closer to take a look. “Magnify! ”</p><p>“Magnify it! ”</p><p>There was no need to enlarge it. The figure outside the Forest of Miracles had already raised his head. He revealed a face that only existed in memories, in the ‘arrest warrant’ posters and in legends.</p><p>His gaze was no longer as keen as everyone thought it would be. It was more turbid, but his facial features were still three-dimensional, and his eyebrows still resembled swords.</p><p>There was a scar on his neck and only eight fingers on his hand…</p><p>There was nothing much to say. If nothing unexpected happened, was this Xu Xiaoshou’s clone that had disappeared?</p><p>However, this time, everyone sensed that something was amiss.</p><p>Unlike Xu Xiaoshou and Xiao Kongtong’s imitation forms, this person’s temperament was too ordinary and too… back to basics?</p><p>The sword cognition that flashed by just now was slightly different.</p><p>In the chaotic battle, his calm and leisurely manner was at odds with the nervousness and urgency of the people on Abyss Island.</p><p>Everyone looked at Rao Yaoyao and Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>If anyone could confirm this person’s identity, it was not them, but his rival from the same generation!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao and Dao Qiongcang had the same reaction.</p><p>He lowered his eyes and stared fixedly at the figure in the Forest of Miracles.</p><p>The answer was obvious.</p><p>“What did he say…”</p><p>The figure in the spirit mirror was arrogant, as if he really was not aware of everyone’s gaze. He only continued to move forward slowly and calmly, one step at a time. He stepped on the ground littered with withered branches and leaves that snapped underfoot as he walked towards the Desolate Inferno Domain.</p><p>However, he could clearly sense that he had an audience. His lips moved as he muttered something in a low voice.</p><p>The spirit mirror was too slow to capture the sound. The burly man was almost beaten to death.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s gaze was fixed intently, but he laughed out loud after he heard that. He shook his head and said.</p><p>“The clouds and wild cranes are leisurely. I forgot my shame when I underwent sanctification and became an emperor. I’ll borrow your three-foot sword and you can watch me cut off all the worries in the world…”</p><p>“Bazhun’an, it’s you!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
