(2)</p><p>His energy reserve had been completely depleted!</p><p>The draining power of the water ball had sapped his life force!</p><p>The combination of the secondary plane door, Water-type Upanishad, and Sea God’s Trident had led to this moment!</p><p>“Farewell, Dao Qiongcang.”</p><p>Above the deep sea, as the Water Ghost stepped on the waves, an Original Sealing Spear appeared in his hand, its force resembling an arrow at full draw.</p><p>While his initial fear of Dao Qiongcang was mostly a facade, his grand plan had indeed succeeded, and he now held the upper hand. Under the Spell Forbidden Barrier, all beings were equal, and even Dao Qiongcang appeared as weak as a chicken.</p><p>However, the Water Ghost remained vigilant, never lowering his guard for a moment.</p><p>He brought out the newly formed contract of the Original Sealing Spear, knowing that under the sealing power of this supreme divine weapon, even if Dao Qiongcang had a trick up his sleeve, it would be impossible to break through the double seal and have a chance to prevail.</p><p>Today, Dao Qiongcang would meet his end!</p><p>“Sizzle—”</p><p>With no time to spare, the Original Sealing Spear was hurled forth with unrelenting force.</p><p>The long spear pierced the deep sea, breaking through the water like an enraged dragon tearing into its prey, forcing its way toward Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>“Decree!”</p><p>At the critical moment, Dao Qiongcang had exhausted all his tricks.</p><p>Drawing Divine Path patterns required Holy Power, and activating the defensive holy weapons, spirit charms, and magic pearls on his body also required Holy Power.</p><p>Under the Spell Forbidden Barrier, none of these things worked for Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>“Is this the taste of the Dead Sea?” A trace of despair flashed in Dao Qiongcang’s eyes.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Original Sealing Spear violently pierced his chest.</p><p>On Dao Qiongcang’s elegant attire, those defensive spiritual weapons that needed to be activated were instantly shattered.</p><p>And what was triggered passively was a sudden, bright pattern of light.</p><p>Yet under the Spell Forbidden Barrier, these defensive spiritual weapons, which had just started to resist the sealing power of the Original Sealing Spear, were obliterated before even touching it.</p><p>All defense became futile.</p><p>The demi-saint, stripped of his protections, now seemed vulnerable.</p><p>The Original Sealing Spear did not hesitate for even a moment, tearing through Dao Qiongcang’s heart and dragging his body toward the ground, crashing into a deep pit.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A dull echo resounded and spread.</p><p>Crimson bled into the deep sea and tainted the observers’ eyes.</p><p>“How is this possible?”</p><p>The battle had occurred in the First Hall of Sins. Even without a spirit mirror, many witnesses were left in shock.</p><p>“The Hallmaster Dao was killed by the Water Ghost in a single strike?”</p><p>“The Dao Qiongcang, one of the Ten High Nobles, met his end in the Sky City?”</p><p>“One wrong step, and it becomes a regret for eternity. Even the enigmatic and unpredictable Hallmaster Dao will have his day of reckoning?”</p><p>“Haha, what a pitiful end… Hallmaster Dao, how could you have perished so easily?” A spectator named Li almost burst into laughter.</p><p>Atop the dragon’s head, Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze lost focus, and his mind briefly went blank.</p><p>“The Water Ghost succeeded?”</p><p>“This can’t be possible!”</p><p>From the bottom of his heart, Xu Xiaoshou could not believe that Dao Qiongcang could be killed so easily.</p><p>But at this point, even though this was just a demi-saint incarnation of Dao Qiongcang, he seemed to be no more.</p><p>Under the Spell Forbidden Barrier, demi-saints who were ancient swordsmen and not physique cultivators were as weak as ordinary mortals.</p><p>The Water Ghost had orchestrated everything to slay a saint as a higher void.</p><p>Regardless of the final outcome, whether Dao Qiongcang could be resurrected or not, the Water Ghost could already consider it a complete success.</p><p>This was almost the perfect lesson!</p><p>The Water Ghost had shattered the illusion of the Ten High Nobles being invulnerable, forever invincible.</p><p>While he should have been accustomed to it, having slain saints on Abyss Island multiple times, this time, even the unpredictable Dao Qiongcang fell within his grasp. It was utterly inconceivable.</p><p>“To defeat, capture, and kill… these aren’t even challenging tasks to him. Moreover, it was a battle between higher void and demi-saint!”</p><p>“Who exactly is the Water Ghost?”</p><p>Countless people were shocked, remembering the man with the golden beast mask above the deep sea. They swore never to provoke him, regardless of what the future held.</p><p>Despite successfully striking down Dao Qiongcang with the Original Sealing Spear, the Water Ghost lost his smile, his gaze more vigilant than ever.</p><p>“You are not Dao Qiongcang!”</p><p>He peered down from his height, his eyes like sharpened knives, as if viciously tearing apart the disguise of the man who had been struck by the spear.</p><p>“Waah!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang, on the verge of closing his eyes, let out a painful cry, like the wailing of a newborn baby.</p><p>“Ouch, Xiao Qi is in so much pain. It hurts so much! ”</p><p>“Elder Dao, please save me…”</p><p>With a bang, Dao Qiongcang, who had been pierced by the Original Sealing Spear and thrown into a deep pit, exploded into smoke and transformed into the appearance of the Divine Elf Qi.</p><p>This small and adorable Divine Elf had the Original Sealing Spear completely impaled through its chest.</p><p>Its body was so small that the spear almost split its chest.</p><p>In agony, its flushed face became contorted and eventually twisted into a grimace as it vomited incessantly.</p><p>It seemed like it wanted to vomit out all its blood, but after a while, it remembered that it did not have “blood” and realized it had become too immersed in the role.</p><p>“Xiao Qi is so weak. If only Xiao Qi was a bit stronger…” The Divine Elf went from self-deprecating to self-blaming, feeling its life force rapidly fading.</p><p>The life of the Divine Puppet was granted by the Divine Array, which drew power from the Divine Path Principles.</p><p>The Original Sealing Spear severed this connection, and Xiao Qi lost the source of its life force, leading to rapid deterioration.</p><p>“Is he… Xiao Qi?”</p><p>But not a single person cared about Xiao Qi’s life or death.</p><p>Not only Xu Xiaoshou but all those Cutting Path Stage and Higher Void individuals in the First Hall of Sins who were imprisoned within the water ball were astounded.</p><p>The clock was ticking on their lives, and they had no control over their fate. Yet, just before their deaths, they bore witness to this bizarre scene.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had become a Divine Elf?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
