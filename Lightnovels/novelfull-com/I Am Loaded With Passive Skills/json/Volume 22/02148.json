(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“Even Water Ghost of the sanctification can’t take it.’ “The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was killed by the rules.”</p><p>“My Holy Emperor’s power is more fundamental….”</p><p>In the air, Xu Xiaoshou, who had been flung by the precious dragon, saw</p><p>Wangze, the Holy Emperor’s finger strike and the defeat of his own army.</p><p>In the eyes of outsiders, he was scared silly, but in fact, he was still comparing the power of their fingers through combat strength analysis.</p><p>With this method, he could deduce the strength of Wangze, the Holy Emperor!</p><p>From the beginning to the end, Xu Xiaoshou never gave up, nor did he lose control and shout like a bystander.</p><p>He still held the arrogant thoughts he had when the Holy Emperor first arrived. Was there any way to bury him on the Abyss Island as well?</p><p>It was true that killing Rao Yaoyao was a reckless move, but Xu Xiaoshou had already foreseen the worst outcome whenever he was determined to go his own way.</p><p>Despite that, he would still do as he wanted.</p><p>He ignored the Water Ghost’s advice.</p><p>Because he had a brain, he could calculate, and he knew what trump cards he had.</p><p>The Azure Finger was unshakable in the eyes of outsiders, but Xu Xiaoshou did not think so.</p><p>He was someone who had seen great storms.</p><p>The Demon Emperor Black Dragon had been his mount before. Xu Xiaoshou would not underestimate the Holy Emperor, but he would not think highly of him either.</p><p>Although the power of this finger was indeed great, it was actually just so-so. Its strength was similar to the smash that the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon made with its tail. Normal people would not be able to withstand it.</p><p>Bai Lian couldn’t take it because compared to the existence of the Water Ghost, he was still too normal of a person.</p><p>However, Water Ghost’s Sea of Wind and Thunder could use the Upanishad Demi-saint’s Power to grind away 30% of the power of the Azure Finger.</p><p>Before its death, the Demon Emperor Black Dragon’s Dragon Pearl power lasted for ten breaths of time, wearing away more than half of its remaining power.</p><p>From that moment, the Azure Finger was only left with the Holy Emperor’s pressure. It didn’t even have 10 to 20% of its original power.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou stabilized himself in the air, he had already figured out the Holy Emperor Wangze’s combat strength under the cover of his panic.</p><p>“It’s just a thought incarnation of a Holy Emperor. It’s similar to the precious dragon, but his use of the spell is different.”</p><p>“At most, he can resist the Will of the Abyss Island Spirit because his main body isn’t on the inner island, which is why he can do more than the precious dragon.”</p><p>“However, unless the Holy Emperor personally comes, the power he can unleash here is still extremely limited…”</p><p>There was another reason why Xu Xiaoshou was so sure that the Holy Emperor Wangze’s power was limited.</p><p>The Holy Emperor hadn’t erased his Soul and Body Extermination Finger. He had only used the storm to keep it away from Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>Why?</p><p>If he had spare energy, would he have left this explosive source seed on Abyss Island?</p><p>That was right. It was impossible!</p><p>“Soul and Body Extermination Finger is already a power that can harm a Holy Emperor physically and spiritually.”</p><p>“Holy Emperor Wangze didn’t eliminate it but instead restrained it. This means that his thought incarnation didn’t hold back when he pointed. He’ll lose everything if he doesn’t do anything!”</p><p>“That’s all! Rao Wangze only had this much power! As long as I’m careful, I can kill him on Abyss Island!”</p><p>“Moreover, he made the same mistake as Rao Yaoyao… Acting all high and mighty!”</p><p>Those who were high above would underestimate their enemies.</p><p>Those who underestimated the enemy were bound to capsize in the gutter.</p><p>His spiritual senses only swept across Bazhun’an, who was standing still. From that, Xu Xiaoshou knew that although he was reckless, he was still stable in the big picture.</p><p>After all, Bazhun’an was not in a hurry!</p><p>This proved that his previous speculation was wrong.</p><p>Could it be that Bazhun’an had been aiming to destroy the power of the Holy Emperor from the start?</p><p>Then, with this as the starting point, what would he prepare…</p><p>It was impossible for him to fight against a Holy Emperor alone.</p><p>No matter how much Bazhun’an trusted him, the Holy Emperor wasn’t stupid.</p><p>The answer was obvious.</p><p>“Demonic Emperor Black Dragon is a card…”</p><p>“But Bazhun’an is the Master of the black and white veins. Would he only have one card?”</p><p>“Do I have anything else on me?”</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Xu Xiaoshou saw the Azure Finger break through all the defenses and point at his head again.</p><p>There was still panic on his face as if he was powerless to change the situation.</p><p>In the distance, Master Siren flew over with his sword and was about to attack.</p><p>The Holy Emperor’s guidance left behind by the white pearl in his body let out a sound once more, guiding him back to the Desolute Inferno Domain.</p><p>Even Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison seemed to be alive.</p><p>At the same time, the Communication Talisman in his chest trembled and a voice came out.</p><p>“Cough…Cough cough! ”</p><p>Coughing?</p><p>The Communication Talisman could transmit messages?</p><p>It didn’t matter anymore!</p><p>The information could be useful for his situation or it could be not!</p><p>At this moment, he could choose to obey the Azure Finger, but he could also choose not to obey!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou would never place all his hopes on others. When danger was imminent, he put away all his panic and revealed a ferocious expression. He roared,</p><p>“Rao Wangze, how dare you underestimate me!”</p><p>This shout of the Holy Emperor’s name was earth-shattering.</p><p>“How dare he? That’s Wang Ze, the Holy Emperor…”</p><p>“Why not? It’s just a wail before death. Out of all his body, Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth is the toughest.”</p><p>“Sigh, a pitiful person often has something pitiable about them, yet there may be something hateful about them as well. Xu Xiaoshou is indeed… Wait, what did he take out?”</p><p>Everyone saw Xu Xiaoshou take something out of his hand, but they didn’t see what he was holding.</p><p>At this moment, time was frozen!</p><p>This scene was familiar. Xu Xiaoshou had used it before. It came from…</p><p>“Time Ancestor Shadow Staff?”</p><p>A surprised voice sounded from the horizon.</p><p>However, that was all. The pressure of the Holy Emperor suppressed the laws of time once more, and everyone on Abyss Island recovered..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
