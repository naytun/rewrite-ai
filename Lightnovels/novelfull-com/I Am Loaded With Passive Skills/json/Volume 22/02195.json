(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>So this was sent by the Cold Palace Emperor Realm to check on Wangze Holy Emperor’s injuries.</p><p>It was over.</p><p>Not only would the Wu Rao Emperor Realm be at a disadvantage in the upcoming resource transactions.</p><p>The position of the current Five Holy Emperor aristocratic family was a lucrative position that belonged to the Wu Rao Emperor Realm, was also about to be taken by this fox.</p><p>D*mn Yue Gongli!</p><p>Yunlun Mountain Range.</p><p>The sword withdrew its Force, and half of the Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation disappeared from the spatial crack.</p><p>The afterimage of that lonely and arrogant black figure that killed people and did not leave a trace disappeared and he was no longer in the human world.</p><p>The fallen plum blossoms had disappeared.</p><p>The strand of remnant thought that belonged to Rao Yaoyao, that had no resistance whatsoever, disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“Woo…”</p><p>Foreign affairs, foreign things, both shared the same sadness.</p><p>The sword cries that came from the depths of the soul roused everyone.</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao, Saint Fall!”</p><p>There was no chance to start all over again, and the one who died was not a demi-saint incarnation or thought Incarnation.</p><p>Truly, the world’s Number One Sword Maiden, the Seven Sword Deity and the Ruler of the red-clothed people… had fallen!</p><p>“No way, Fairy Rao died?”</p><p>“The person who killed her was Xu Xiaoshou? I remember that Xu Xiaoshou was only at the Innate Stage. He was at this realm during the night battle in the imperial city, right?”</p><p>“Master Stage! At that time, he had already broken through to the Master Stage! Don’t insult Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“What are you talking about? Can a Master Stage kill a Saint?”</p><p>These words rendered the people speechless. A Master Stage indeed could not kill a Saint, not even a Sovereign Stage could do it.</p><p>The foundation of a Saint slayer had to be at least at the peak of the higher void, right?</p><p>However, Rao Yaoyao was also a genius who could jump realms to fight!</p><p>The strength that Xu Xiaoshou displayed earlier had completely surpassed that of a Master Stage…</p><p>The sword’s power of the Upanishad, even if it didn’t surpass the Saint realm, it was at least the power that could only be unleashed by the full-strength counterattack of the old ashes of the major sects when they were on the verge of death, right?</p><p>“Then it’s not Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“All of you must be in a daze. The person with such mastery in the Heart Sword Technique must be the Seven Sword Deity, Mei Siren. I saw it personally. Master Siren was made a Saint in Sky City.”</p><p>“Oh? You saw it with your own eyes. You, a Sovereign Dao Realm, can come back alive from Sky City?”</p><p>“Heh, who are you looking down on? I’ve seen it before!”</p><p>“You’re all wrong. I’m from the Southern Region. I can tell you specifically that the person who killed Rao Yaoyao is the famous Saint Servant, Lord Shou. He’s at the peak of higher void level!”</p><p>Rumors started to spread. Some said that it was Xu Xiaoshou’s explosive seed; some said that he was possessed by a demi-saint ghost beast; and some said that it was the Seven Sword Deity disguised as Mei Siren, after he underwent his sanctification.</p><p>But no matter what, more than ten thousand people had witnessed how Xu Xiaoshou’s form had slashed the Seven Sword Deity, Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>This time, the reputation of the Saint Servant and Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou had spread far and wide.</p><p>Even the famed sword he held in his hand had a mythical meaning to it.</p><p>Some people said that the black vicious sword could only be Fourth Sword; some said that it was the Devil Sword Myriad Weapons Devil Lord, and some said that Xu Xiaoshou had a sword that matched all the characteristics of the saber he had when he was in the Tiansang Spirit Palace. It even had a Reverse Sword Subduing technique.</p><p>That sword was called Hidden Bitter and it was only at the ninth grade.</p><p>A ninth-grade spiritual sword was able to slash Rao Yaoyao. This was undoubtedly something that could only happen among myths and legends.</p><p>“Hidden Bitter, Hidden Bitter, after three years in hiding, you became a Sword Deity.”</p><p>“Holy Sword Land, Holy Sword Land, every thirty years, each generation would produce a demon genius!”</p><p>“Bazhun’an from the Eastern Region, Xu Xiaoshou from the Eastern Region…</p><p>Tsk tsk, I have a feeling that a new era is about to begin!”</p><p>In the midst of countless discussions, Yu Zhiwen had already returned to the spirit mirror master’s seat and muttered.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, was that you…”</p><p>Elder Yu, who had yet to recover from the sudden appearance of Bazhun’an in the ancient book, trembled when he heard this. “Little Yu. what did vou sav? Who was that Derson?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I told you before…” “Xu Xiaoshou? You know him? How old is he?”</p><p>“He is the same age as me…”</p><p>Elder Yu was stunned. He looked at his precious great-granddaughter, who seemed absent-minded and had a strange look on her face.</p><p>He had never seen his precious great-granddaughter in such a besotted state before and all because of an outsider.</p><p>There were so many geniuses on the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, but Yu Zhiwen had never bothered about them before. She had always been aloof.</p><p>Then this Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>Elder Yu hesitated for a moment. At this moment, he had even forgotten that Rao Yaoyao had been beheaded in front of him by this outsider. There were only some new thoughts in his mind.</p><p>“That Xu Xiaoshou is indeed very powerful, but your eyes and expression…”</p><p>“What’s going on with the two of you?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
