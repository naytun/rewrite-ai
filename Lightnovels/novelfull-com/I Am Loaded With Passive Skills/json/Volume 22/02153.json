(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio     Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, hold it right there…”</p><p>“Shut up or die.”</p><p>“Ugh!” Bai Lian’s cheeks trembled and it took almost all his strength to restrain himself. In the end, he left silently.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was really so ruthless.</p><p>How did you manage to make me want to hit you when you just uttered two sentences?</p><p>“+(Criticized, Passive Points+)+2.”</p><p>“Teacher, here.”</p><p>As soon as he entered the arena, Xu Xiaoshou who had just berated his junior brother who was older than him, threw the Mystery Boxes to Master Siren.</p><p>Mei Siren looked away from Bai Lian and his master with an unfriendly expression, and stared at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He didn’t know if he should admonish his student for being so arrogant or praise his acting skills.</p><p>Finally, he took out his folding fan.</p><p>“Awesome, awesome.”</p><p>“How do you feel?” Xu Xiaoshou asked expectantly after he took out the Mystery Boxes and signed the blood contract.</p><p>Mei Siren stared at his student and didn’t want to say anything. He flipped his fan and said.</p><p>“It’s alright, it’s alright.” Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>Great!</p><p>Why are you still worked up about it at a time like this?</p><p>I was not being arrogant. I just did that to rile up Cutie Rao.</p><p>With a pop, Water Ghost pulled himself out of Xu Xiaoshou’s body. He tried to hold the golden beast mask, but failed. He then frowned intently and stared at Xu Xiaoshou’s chest.</p><p>“Bazhun’an?”</p><p>“I’m here.”</p><p>“I can’t beat him!” When he heard that it was really Bazhun’an, Water Ghost immediately became anxious. “You have to come out…”</p><p>“Leave it to Xu Xiaoshou. He can handle it.”</p><p>This time, it was not only Water Ghost who was stunned. Mei Siren and Xu Xiaoshou were also stunned.</p><p>“Me?” Xu Xiaoshu took out the Communication Talisman and shouted at it, “What the hell are you talking about…”</p><p>“Cough cough!” Mei Siren cleared his throat.</p><p>“Are you kidding me? Bazhun’an…” Xu Xiaoshou gritted his teeth and said softly.</p><p>“Never place your hopes on others. Follow your own pace. What were your thoughts?” The Communication Talisman glowed again.</p><p>Mei Siren cleared his throat and stared at the familiar yet strange talisman and fell into deep thought.</p><p>It turned out that he could send a message…</p><p>“There’s no time.” Water Ghost didn’t expect that Bazhun’an would still keep him in suspense when he was on the brink of death. He could already feel the power of the Holy Emperor closing in!</p><p>“Still testing? Test you…” Xu Xiaoshou’s brain spun rapidly as he swallowed back his curses.</p><p>According to his previous thoughts, if Bazhun’an wanted to slaughter the Holy Emperor, they could only rely on the Holy Emperor to fight.</p><p>It was unlikely that Eighth Brother would act on his own. He would only be able to do so through the power of the Inner Island White Vein’s Third Ancestor and the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>However, the black dragon had already been overused and was now out of action.</p><p>Furthermore, the seal on the Inner Island had been strengthened after Dao Qiongcang came out. The two worlds could no longer be connected.</p><p>“That’s all I can think of.’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took out Flame Python, the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch, and the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale and asked, “I can borrow the power of the Holy Emperor through them?”</p><p>“It’s not enough. What you think is far from enough.” Bazhun’an said calmly.</p><p>This was still not enough?</p><p>However Xu Xiaoshou had indeed felt that he had taken it for granted.</p><p>The reason why he could borrow the power of the white bead was because the Great Infernal Ancestor had hidden it in the White Cave.</p><p>How could he borrow the power of the other Holy Emperors?</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>Bazhun’an only said that it was not enough and did not refute.</p><p>So, could their strength really be borrowed?</p><p>Not enough… Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes went blank for a moment. He thought that if there was a key that could break the two worlds and connect them, then the key should be with someone.</p><p>After all, he had used it before!</p><p>“How did you get through to Abyss Island?” Xu Xiaoshou looked at Water Ghost.</p><p>“I used the secondary plane door, the void gate and my son.” Water Ghost said calmly even though he seemed rather uncomfortable after he lost his golden beast mask.</p><p>The Communication Talisman lit up. Bazhun’an’s faint laughter could be heard. “He did not ask about the item. He’s after the incantation.</p><p>Incantation?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was confused, Mei Siren only knew how to use the sword, and Water Ghost was lost in thought. “You’re talking about…. Patriarch Wuji?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
