(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Today, with a single gesture, he banished the hiding place of Wangze Holy Emperor.</p><p>Thirty years on the east of the river, thirty years on the west, a tale of changing tides. A young man with the Four Divine Pillars was not to be underestimated.</p><p>Even though at this moment, Xu Xiaoshou could only identify a silhouette, unable to pinpoint the exact location of Wangze Holy Emperor—similar to how, in his state of disappearance, the enemy could only banish a vast expanse of space to constrain him.</p><p>It did not matter.</p><p>At that time, when they attacked him, they needed repeated attempts to exile him, pressing on the limits of his survival space.</p><p>Now, with the additional force of the Four Divine Pillars, Xu Xiaoshou was truly unrestrained. Without hesitation, he uttered a single word:</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>With a squeeze of his palm, the Sleeping Valley exploded in an instant.</p><p>The dazzling white light was more eye-catching than the endless sun summoned by Yan Wuse in the past.</p><p>The crowd collectively averted their gaze from the spirit mirror, only to witness the distant sky erupting with blazing sunlight. It burst forth, sweeping away boundless waves of energy, surging and sweeping across the Sleeping Valley.</p><p>The entire site of the First Hall of Sins, along with the surrounding giant kingdom, was obliterated by the explosive energy reserve. The spiritual cultivators were thrown into disarray.</p><p>Ancient buildings swayed dangerously.</p><p>The world lost all sound, leaving only people in a silent world screaming hysterically, trying to save themselves.</p><p>Wiping the blood from his face, Li Fugui looked around, and a bewildered expression appeared on his face.</p><p>“What am I doing?” “Even from this distance, can I still be affected?”</p><p>“Why are they so high…</p><p>Lowering his head, Li Fugui discovered that his feet had been swept into a mangled state, with the cut areas charred, turned into scars by the intense heat.</p><p>And this was after taking every necessary precaution!</p><p>The lingering impact of the Holy Emperor’s power resulted in this?</p><p>Escape was impossible. The ground beneath his feet trembled, indicating that Abyss Island was experiencing a massive earthquake from the explosion.</p><p>Once everyone regained their senses, they attended to their own wounds while glancing around, their movements skilled.</p><p>Hide?</p><p>Escape?</p><p>Defend?</p><p>None were possible!</p><p>Since that was the case, it was a blessing as long as they did not die.</p><p>In the battle of the Holy Emperor, merely witnessing it was its own reward, and being able to gain some insights was even better.</p><p>Fate was so unpredictable, and understanding “accept what comes” could make one capable of achieving the impossible.</p><p>The Sleeping Valley was completely shattered!</p><p>When everyone looked again, the place now resembled the second Ghost City of the Netherworld.</p><p>The former was smashed by a certain dragon and became ruins.</p><p>As for the latter, it served as the burial ground accompanying a certain Holy Emperor to the afterlife.</p><p>However…</p><p>“Wangze Holy Emperor, is he really dead with just one strike?”</p><p>While pondering this, in the fragmented world, a bloody figure rose into the air.</p><p>The Sleeping Valley, including the Stone Giant, was blasted into pieces, with no place to be buried.</p><p>Apart from the thought incarnation of the Wangze Holy Emperor, who else could still rise from there?</p><p>But…</p><p>“Blood?”</p><p>A high and mighty existence, Wangze Holy Emperor descended from the Stairway to Heaven. How could a mortal truly blast him into bleeding?</p><p>Yet, there was no room for disbelief. The fact was right in front of them.</p><p>Everyone realized that under the influence of the Four Divine Pillars, Xu Xiaoshou was indeed qualified to challenge Wangze Holy Emperor.</p><p>The Holy Emperor’s attempt to escape was not one of the choices that people intuitively explained or reasoned within themselves.</p><p>It was the only choice!</p><p>If he did not run and was caught by Xu Xiaoshou, he would truly be blown to death on this Abyss Island!</p><p>Under the full moon, at the pinnacle of the solitary tower.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou slowly raised his index finger in front of his face, shaking it at an extremely slow speed…</p><p>A smirk appeared on his lips as he sneered:</p><p>“Rao Wangze, you are too weak.”</p><p>“Unable to even truly erase your traces when disappearing, how dare you play hide-and-seek with me? It’s ridiculous.’</p><p>“The stench of you is so prominent; across the Sleeping Valley and the Desolate Inferno Domain, like a white pig that has been dead for three days and no one cares about. Even without looking, I can smell it…”</p><p>One taunting remark after another.</p><p>Listening to Xu Xiaoshou’s arrogant words, everyone felt their hearts pounding, but little did they know that he was not finished.</p><p>When it came to the climax, the figure on the solitary tower raised his chest proudly and said, “If you know your place, crawl up and kneel. I will give you…” Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, the bloodied figure on the Sleeping Valley trembled ever so slightly.</p><p>With a gust of wind, the figure disappeared from the Sleeping Valley.</p><p>Above the Desolate Inferno Domain, within the vast expanse of white flames coalescing into a sphere by the power emanating from the wind core, a glimmer of consciousness rekindled.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Suppressing his emotions as much as possible, he uttered a seemingly calm voice that set off a frenzy in the Information Bar:</p><p>“Locked-on, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Glared At, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Ambushed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>It turned out that the Holy Emperor’s state of mind was not as calm as a still pond. It was just that when their positions were far from balanced, trash talk was useless.</p><p>But when you were on an equal footing and still spoke nonsense, even a saint, being human, could not help but feel anger.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou found it amusing.</p><p>Given his reaction, under the support of the Four Divine Pillars, he could easily see the power of Rao Wangze awakening in the fireball wind core. How could</p><p>he not be cautious!</p><p>“Why did you call for me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes slanted, a sinister look appearing on his face.</p><p>In a timely manner, the phantom of the Seven Trees swayed behind him. A green chain flew out from his hand, and with an open mouth, he expelled a power-condensed Black Dragon Pearl, laughing maniacally and saying:</p><p>“With the Infernal Power alone, I will beat you to a pulp!”</p><p>“You pig! How dare you approach me? Do you think the three remaining forces on my body are just decorations?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
