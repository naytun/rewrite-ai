Don’t make us, the Rao family…”</p><p>“Attack me?” Yue Gongli pursed his lips and held the back of his head with both hands. He leaned back and walked forward.</p><p>“Stop this pretense, Rao Buku. Do you think that I can’t see through your intentions?”</p><p>“Wangze Holy Emperor was clearly in trouble. Bazhun’an was on Abyss Island. Wangze Holy Emperor cannot afford not to pay any attention to him. You should know that, right?”</p><p>“Heh, because of that guy, my big sister is still locked up in the cold prison. I’ve investigated and studied him.”</p><p>“The one who attacked was Bazhu’nan, and Abyss Island was half of his backyard. Could it be that Wangze Holy Emperor’s Clone of Will was killed?” Yue Gongli covered his mouth and shouted out in shock.</p><p>“No way, no way, could it be that Wangze Holy Emperor’s thought incarnation wasn’t killed, but captured by the Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison? That would be a big deal!”</p><p>“You and I have witnessed the ability of the Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison. If one’s thought incarnation was captured and exerted a reversal influence on the original body…”</p><p>‘Wow!”</p><p>Yue Gongli’s mouth gaped so much that he could almost swallow a fist. His handsome face was distorted by his exaggerated expression. He said in excitement.</p><p>“I should take this opportunity and lead the Yue clan to attack the Wu Rao Emperor Realm and plunder a few of your divine objects. Then, I will capture a few delicate Rao…</p><p>“Yue! Gong! Li!” Rao Buku enunciated each word in his anger.</p><p>“I’m just joking, I’m just joking, hehe.” Yue Gongli waved his hand in front of his mouth, and his eyes turned into crescents as he laughed. He patted the higher void Rao Buku’s shoulder and pointed at the jade pendant on his waist.</p><p>“It’s lit up. The higher-ups sent you a message!”</p><p>“Let me guess. They probably want to discuss the matter of Rao Yaoyao’s death and Wangze Holy Emperor’s injuries?”</p><p>“Or, they have ordered you to drive me away immediately and then meet up at the Eight Directions Divine Court… Hehe, I came at the right time. Hurry up and answer it.”</p><p>Rao Buku took a deep breath, but he didn’t dare to say anything. He only took off the jade pendant on his waist.</p><p>This foxy man’s personality was exactly the same as his sister’s!</p><p>One ignored the rules, fell in love with the inferior species of the Shengshen Continent, and even secretly gave birth to his descendant.</p><p>The other was lawless and dared to do whatever he wanted just because he was favored and was one of the successors at the Cold Palace Emperor Realm. He even dared to ridicule the Holy Emperor.</p><p>However, Rao Buku could not show his feelings openly.</p><p>Yue Bei Hua Rao Dao. That was a ranking from a long time ago.</p><p>Now, after the Lei Family was destroyed, even the Dao Clan’s strength had increased slightly.</p><p>The Rao Clan would be forced to take a back seat, let alone compete with the Yue Clan. They had always been the strongest of the five Holy Emperor aristocratic families since ancient times.</p><p>“Beep. ”</p><p>As soon as the call was connected, Rao Buku’s vision blurred and he realized that the jade token in his hand had disappeared.</p><p>“You!”</p><p>He turned and glared.</p><p>As expected, Yue Gongli, this lawless fox, had already put the jade token to his ear. His pointy ears perked up, and he listened with bated breath.</p><p>“After Rao Yaoyao’s Saint Fall, Wangze Holy Emperor’s divine senses had changed. ”</p><p>“The position of the Ruler of the red-clothed people in the Council of Ten in the Holy Divine Palace is temporarily vacant. The current generation of the Rao Clan will hold another discussion…”</p><p>“After the time it took for an incense stick to burn, the Wu Rao Emperor Realm would be sealed off.’</p><p>“The people from the Eight Directions Divine Court rushed over and are now in a discussion after they received the news. There can’t be any mistakes.” Yue Gongli’s expression changed when he heard that.</p><p>He moved the jade token away, covered his mouth and emitted a series of strange ‘oh oh’ sounds.</p><p>“Incredible, incredible!”</p><p>“I guessed it right. Wangze Holy Emperor was injured?”</p><p>“Yue! Gong! Li!” Rao Buku clenched his fists tightly. “You have already angered my clan…”</p><p>“Here, take it back!” Yue Gongli licked his lips and his eyes glowed. He quickly thrust the jade token into Rao Buku’s mouth and flew away. He said.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ll keep Wangze Holy Emperor’s injury a secret… he could not even save Rao Yaoyao. He must have been severely injured!”</p><p>“I won’t tell anyone about the five Holy Emperor Secret Realm and that includes the members of our Yue clan… Rao Buku, please write a guarantee for me and sign my name. If anything happens, I’ll look for you.”</p><p>“In addition, I’m tired of staying in this broken world. I’ll fight for the position of the Ruler of the red-clothed people. I’m a demi-saint, and my strength had reached the standard. When the time comes, your Rao clan can just vote for me.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, this is not a threat, nor is it an exchange. Feel free to vote against</p><p>it.”</p><p>“I’m going to look for my big sister first. Bazhun’an came to save her. Hahaha… This brat! You really dare!”</p><p>Rao Buku looked at his retreating back and pulled the jade token out of his mouth, his breath cold.</p><p>Yue Gongli!</p><p>This guy should have been like Yue Gongnu and kept locked up in the Cold Palace Emperor Realm’s cold prison. It was too infuriating!</p><p>However…</p><p>In the Yue Clan, other than his unrepentant big sister, this fellow was the most favored.</p><p>In the Wu Rao Emperor Realm, as long as Wangze Holy Emperor didn’t come out and kill anyone, he Yue Gongli could even rebel against the Heavens because he had the Yue Clan to back him up.</p><p>The situation was stronger than the person.</p><p>Rao Buku could only swallow his anger and rush to the Eight Directions Divine Court with the jade token in his hand, his heart filled with grief.</p><p>He knew that this fellow was up to no good when he went up the mountain. He even used the excuse that he wanted to pay a visit in order to climb the mountain..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
