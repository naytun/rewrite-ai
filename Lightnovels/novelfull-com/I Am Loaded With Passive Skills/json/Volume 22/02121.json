It was the same as the foundational roots of Saint Ascension.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The moment Ember Heart appeared, the compressed black flames on Mu Ling’s body went out of control and started to surge about wildly.</p><p>The black, nimble Flame of Annihilation that had a mind of its own leaped out of his body.</p><p>This change broke the restriction of the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff and allowed Mu Ling to regain his mobility.</p><p>However, Mu Ling watched in horror as Ember Heart flew towards Xu Xiaoshou and his mouth hung open for a long time.</p><p>He was Demi-Saint Infernal Long Rongzhi’s disciple. He cultivated the mutated black flame in order to perfectly fuse with the heavenly flame, the Flame of Annihilation.</p><p>Until now, his mastery of the Flame of Annihilation had not reached the final-stage of perfection.</p><p>If he wanted to use his Penetrating Divine Senses, he couldn’t use the Flame of Annihilation. If he wanted to use the Flame of Annihilation, he couldn’t use his Penetrating Divine Senses.</p><p>Mu Ling had yet to find this balance and this resulted in him not being able to perfectly control the heavenly flame, the Flame of Annihilation.</p><p>From this, it could be seen how domineering the heavenly flame was, not to mention those related to the Infernal lineage!</p><p>But now…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was able to attract the attention of Ember Heart, that was also a heavenly flame, merely by standing there?</p><p>One could tell just from the name that Ember Heart was more compatible with the Infernal lineage than the Flame of Annihilation!</p><p>NO!</p><p>The Infernal lineage came about due to Ember Heart!</p><p>“Ding, ding, ding…”</p><p>When Ember Heart flew toward Xu Xiaoshou and tried to fuse into his body, the Three Days Frozen Calamity on Xu Xiaoshou’s energy reserve was incensed.</p><p>It was the true master of this energy reserve!</p><p>There was already the Infernal Original Seed here, although it was not as powerful as it was. It was equivalent to the heavenly flame that could only be used for a limited number of times.</p><p>However, the things from the Infernal lineage were always easily irritated!</p><p>The Three Days Frozen Calamity was so mild that even the Infernal Original Seed of Ember could suppress it.</p><p>However, the reason why it could tolerate the Infernal Original Seed that encroached on its territory was because as long as the host used it frequently, it would one day be refined into nothingness.</p><p>However, it was completely different when Ember Heart entered his body. This meant that the hot-tempered Infernal Original Seed would not die at all.</p><p>It would always want to suppress itself and it would never be able to find peace in this energy reserve.</p><p>“Ding, ding, ding…”</p><p>With another rhythmic sound, a peerless Ice Lotus automatically bloomed under Xu Xiaoshou’s feet and displayed its strongest resistance.</p><p>However, at this moment, a thought bloomed in the white bead inside Xu Xiaoshou’s mind. It carried the unparalleled dominance of the Infernal lineage.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>With a sizzle, the Three Days Frozen Calamity was shattered.</p><p>It had no backup or support, so it could only hide in its energy reserve. It didn’t dare to reveal any of its aura and allowed Ember Heart, that had the support of the Holy Emperor, to stay in its energy reserve like a mistress.</p><p>“Pfft, pfft.”</p><p>When Ember Heart fully entered his body.</p><p>The Infernal Original Seed was instantly devoured, but the will of the Infernal Lineage was inherited.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally felt that the Infernal power that was about to erupt could be kept under control.</p><p>But…</p><p>Too much!</p><p>It was still too much!</p><p>This was absolutely the power of a Holy Emperor!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t even a demi-saint. How could his small body withstand the power of a Holy Emperor?</p><p>“Vent…”</p><p>“I need to vent!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes turned white, and white flames shot out from his eyes.</p><p>He was like a wild beast in heat. He held Flame Python and stared at the Heavenly Ancestor Light that was fixed in the air.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The power of the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff finally lost its effect, and the world returned to order.</p><p>Before the Spiritual Cultivators on Abyss Island who watched the battle could express their shock, Xu Xiaoshou raised his sword.</p><p>“Aaah!”</p><p>Xu the Beast, who could no longer suppress his anger, let out a roar that was similar to the ghost beast. He poured all his power into Flame Python and slashed at the Heavenly Ancestor Light.</p><p>Whoosh!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
