(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Just as she had this thought, Elder Yu shouted aloud.</p><p>The Saint Language reverberated in all directions. It was powerful and clear as it entered the ears of all the trial-takers in the Yunlun Mountain Range.</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao?”</p><p>“It’s Sword Deity Rao! Sword Deity Rao is back!”</p><p>“The war in Sky City had ended? Weren’t there four demi-saints who passed by just now? How could they have been dealt with by Fairy Rao so quickly?”</p><p>“Impressive! As expected of the Number One Sword Maiden; as expected of the Seven Sword Deity!”</p><p>“You’re wrong. Judging from the sword cry just now, Sword Deity Rao must have made a breakthrough. Perhaps I should call her Sword Saint Rao now!”</p><p>Everyone looked forward to Rao Yaoyao’s dazzling debut in the arena and her perfect comeback to counter the final-stage disaster brought by Sky City.</p><p>But there was none.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was silent and did not respond to Elder Yu. After she underwent sanctification, she had become very low-key.</p><p>At this moment, after the mournful sword cry, the sky suddenly cracked, and the Sword Will that filled the sky shot out.</p><p>“Sword again?”</p><p>“There’s still a sword saint?”</p><p>“No way. Who could it be? There’s a second sword saint in Sky City? Let me count…”</p><p>“That’s not right. That’s impossible. There had been no news about the Seven</p><p>Sword Deity. Who else had gone to Sky City other than Fairy Rao?”</p><p>“Eighth Sword Deity?”</p><p>With a loud explosion, the sky within a radius of tens of thousands of miles in the Yunlun Mountain Range shattered like a mirror.</p><p>The Sword Will that filled the sky crisscrossed and outlined a magnificent sword diagram. It was ancient, distant, and powerful.</p><p>It was clear that the force this time was even better than before!</p><p>“This sword diagram…”</p><p>At this moment, the trial-takers on the Yunlun Mountain Range felt that something was amiss</p><p>Why did it seem like it was a poor bandit who was on the run with the enemy on its tail?</p><p>But on second thought, this was too ridiculous!</p><p>The Seven Sword Deity, Rao Yaoyao, who had undergone sanctification, had become a ‘poor bandit’?</p><p>This wasn’t funny!</p><p>“Way of the Sword, Power Upanishad Formation…”</p><p>On Pixiu Mountain, Su Qianqian, who held a fierce black broadsword in her arms, stared dazedly at the sky, her face filled with shock.</p><p>“Little junior sister, you must have seen wrongly. This is clearly…” Gu Qingsan was also stunned. As he spoke, he gulped.</p><p>“Third Senior Brother, if it was not that, then what was it?”</p><p>“I didn’t say it wasn’t…” Gu Qingsan trembled. “This is clearly, it is clearly!”</p><p>The conversation between the two ancient swordsmen spread from one to ten, ten to a hundred, and in an instant, everyone in the Xu Faction on the peak of Pixiu Mountain knew about it.</p><p>Even Jiang Xian, who wanted to leave the Imperial City Trial but was caught by the Xu Faction and locked in a cage, knew that this was the power of the Upanishad.</p><p>However, so what if it was the power of the Upanishad?</p><p>You ants have never seen a real demi-saint fight!</p><p>Jiang Xian was trapped in a cage and was filled with humiliation. However, he thought in his heart, “If my clan’s demi-saint Jiang Buyi were to attack, he would be able to turn his palm into clouds and his palm into rain. With just a finger, he would be able to crush this so-called Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation.”</p><p>“Way of the Sword Upanishad, second realm… That’s not good!”</p><p>Unlike this ignorant Jiang, Elder Yu had seen the Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation before.</p><p>An ancient swordsman’s power of the Upanishad was vastly different from that of a Spiritual Cultivator.</p><p>If it appeared with an array diagram, it must be the second realm of a certain sword technique.</p><p>It seemed that someone really wanted to hunt down Rao Yaoyao?</p><p>But…</p><p>How was that possible?</p><p>How could anyone dare!</p><p>The turmoil in his heart had yet to completely dissipate, but when the Power of Upanishad Formation in the Nine Heavens was released, a voice that was neither sad nor happy, floated down.</p><p>“Swordsmanship is famous. It’s called heart…”</p><p>“The Dao of the heart is godless, faithless and lawless!”</p><p>Heart Sword Technique?</p><p>Elder Yu’s pupils dilated. He turned around and wrapped Yu Zhiwen in his Holy Power and sent her back.</p><p>“Leave the battlefield first!”</p><p>“Grandpa Yu…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was anxious. She stretched out her hand and wanted to resist, but she could not resist the Holy Power.</p><p>She still had something to say.</p><p>This voice sounded high and mighty to everyone, like a God.</p><p>However, Yu Zhiwen felt that it sounded extremely familiar. It was clearly Xu Xiaoshou’s voice. Even though the voice was disguised and sounded cold and aloof, Yu Zhiwen could recognize it immediately.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pursued Rao Yaoyao?</p><p>There is something strange about this. I have to be present. Perhaps I can…</p><p>“Buzz! ”</p><p>By the time the Nine Heavens Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation lit up, Yu Zhiwen had already been teleported to the edge of the Yunlun Mountain Range.</p><p>She gritted her teeth, and the heavenly star light on her body surged. She stepped out, and the starlight followed her as she stepped into the battlefield.</p><p>Falling red flowers danced in the air, and the fragrance of plum blossoms wafted over.</p><p>As soon as she entered, outside Abyss Island, under the map of the sword, a bit of intangible remnant thought was forced out along with the red plum blossoms.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had nowhere to hide!</p><p>She knew that she was the focus of everyone’s attention at the moment. She was naturally embarrassed and angry and did not dare to make a sound.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even give her a chance. He chased after her and wanted to kill her.</p><p>How could he!</p><p>How did he manage to master the second realm of the Heart Sword Technique?</p><p>At this moment, no matter how humiliated or angry she was, Rao Yaoyao had no choice but to shout out with all her might under everyone’s gaze.</p><p>“Elder Yu, save me!!!”</p><p>She had to shout for help.</p><p>If she didn’t shout for help, then the Singer of the Stars and Moon’s sacrifice would have been in vain.</p><p>If she didn’t shout, she would really lose her life. With her life at stake, Rao Yaoyao cast aside her pride and had tears in her eyes.</p><p>Perhaps such setbacks could forge a stronger self…</p><p>Just as Rao Yaoyao had expected, this shout caused the entire Yunlun Mountain Range to break out in an uproar.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao is shouting for help?”</p><p>“Oh my God, she didn’t retreat after she accomplished her task. Instead, she returned empty-handed and was chased out?”</p><p>“That’s impossible. That’s the Seven Sword Deity. How powerful must the person who chased after her be…”</p><p>“The Heart Sword Technique? I remember that the second realm of the Heart Sword Technique is associated with the Seven Sword Deity Mei Siren.. But his voice could not be that young?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
