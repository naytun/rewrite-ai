Are you only left with this trick of dressing up as God, playing the devil?”</p><p>What a familiar routine!</p><p>On the Lone Cliff, when this kid was forced to the end of his rope, he turned into Yi and then into Huang Quan.</p><p>At that time, Rao Yaoyao had already been tricked once.</p><p>Now, even if Xu Xiaoshou didn’t transform on his own and used an external object to make a sound, how could Rao Yaoyao believe it?</p><p>Not to mention her, even the unfathomable and mysterious Dao Qiongcang had some suspicion in his eyes.</p><p>Situ Yongren stood on the stage, feeling even more uneasy.</p><p>He didn’t care about Bazhun’an at all.</p><p>Seeing that this voice had attracted everyone’s attention and that a rookie like him had become invisible and was ignored by everyone, he gladly escaped in the direction of his Supreme Master.</p><p>Could he stay here for long?</p><p>What a joke, of course not!</p><p>Situ Yongren had already used his death to verify the answer to this question.</p><p>That time was not even as dangerous as this time!</p><p>[Suspected, Passive Points +732.]</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little surprised when he took out the Communication Talisman.</p><p>“They can’t see him?”</p><p>Bazhun’an was just outside the Forest of Miracles. It was understandable if Rao</p><p>Yaoyao couldn’t see them, but did Dao Qiongcang not have eyes?</p><p>However, he quickly reacted.</p><p>Before this, he had not been able to see Bazhun’an. He had only been able to see him after receiving the Holy Emperor’s power.</p><p>Since Bazhun’an dared to openly walk out of the Forest of Miracles, he must</p><p>have some treasure that could conceal his body and aura.</p><p>At the very least, it had to be on the level of the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale, right?</p><p>He could see him, but perhaps he actually wanted Xu Xiaoshou to see him.</p><p>As such, as long as Dao Qiongcang didn’t lock onto Bazhun’an, he wouldn’t be able to see him?</p><p>“But Holy Emperor Wangze should be able to see him, right? He is a true Holy Emperor…”</p><p>In an instant, Xu Xiaoshou realized that perhaps the high and mighty Rao Wangze didn’t know what Bazhun’an looked like.</p><p>This was getting interesting!</p><p>Even though the reaction of the people present was somewhat funny, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t laugh.</p><p>The pressure of a Holy Emperor and two demi-saints was still a little too much.</p><p>At this moment, the communication talisman spoke again.</p><p>“Desolate Inferno Domain.</p><p>To this place?</p><p>The Abyss Island was silent for a moment, but in the next second, killing intent rose.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s Cang Godhood Sword flew out. The wind howled in the nine heavens as if it wanted to pursue victory.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s divine Sinan also flipped, regaining control of the Si Wuu Formation to prevent Xu Xiaoshou from borrowing the power of the Heavenly Ancestor again.</p><p>Although he still doubted the authenticity of Bazhun’an, this was the best chance to kill Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He was alone!</p><p>“This famous sword technique…”</p><p>However, at the same time, a calm voice sounded from under everyone’s feet.</p><p>Before he could even finish speaking, the people in the bureau were shocked.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao felt as if her back was being pricked by a thorn. Before she could slash out with her sword, she hurriedly stopped lowering her eyes.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s divine Sinan turned around and used the Great Annihilation Technique.</p><p>Mei Siren?</p><p>Who else could that amiable elder be other than Mei Siren?</p><p>The old sword saint had arrived at some point in time. He wanted to take advantage of the time when the two of them were dealing with Xu Xiaoshou to draw his sword from behind.</p><p>Who dared to underestimate a sword saint attacking from the back? “Master Siren, you’re being a little unethical…” Dao Qiongcang had never thought that the ancient sword saint would have a day where he didn’t care</p><p>about martial ethics.</p><p>Mei Siren smiled at the Great Annihilation Technique and replied, “You guys are being too ethical.”</p><p>These words made everyone choke.</p><p>Among the spectators, even those who stood on the side of the Holy Divine Palace were shocked to realize that Dao Qiongcang and Rao Yaoyao had joined forces to deal with a junior, Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang smiled and did not speak. He was never pedantic.</p><p>To achieve great things, one must use all means.</p><p>Facing the Great Annihilation Technique, Mei Siren changed his sword move from the Heart Sword Technique.</p><p>Just based on his call, everyone could tell that he wanted to use the MO Sword Technique to resist the power of the Great Annihilation Technique.</p><p>However, when the Great Annihilation Technique passed through Mei Siren’s body and broke through his afterimages, everyone finally realized what was going on.</p><p>“It’s not the MO Sword Technique…”</p><p>Mei Siren had disappeared?</p><p>“Space-time Trasition!” Rao Yaoyao was already tongue-tied. “Si…He ran away!”</p><p>Not only did he not follow the martial ethics, but he also learned to deceive.</p><p>By the time Dao Qiongcang reacted, the old Sword Saint had already left the battlefield and entered the Desolate Inferno Domain.</p><p>At the same time, Xu Xiaoshou, who had a tacit understanding with him, took advantage of the fact that the attention of the members of the Holy Divine Palace was diverted and left using spatial teleportation.</p><p>Not even Water Ghost stayed behind. He just flashed into Xu Xiaoshou’s body and hitched a ride.</p><p>“Desolate Inferno Domain!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang turned to look at Wangze, the Holy Emperor. He was waiting for further instructions.</p><p>At this point, he was no longer the leader of this game.</p><p>However, Dao Qiongcang was certain that the voice really came from Bazhun’an. His old rival was on Abyss Island.</p><p>Otherwise, Mei Siren wouldn’t have deceived him because of their status.</p><p>“He’s only helping him out…”</p><p>“It is very likely that he is still in his previous state and is unable to effectively attack…”</p><p>However, Dao Qiongcang did not say anything about this.</p><p>Because he was no longer a chess player, but a chess piece in the game.</p><p>The only one who could make the decision was Wangze, the Holy Emperor.</p><p>“Rao…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao turned around anxiously, afraid that Xu Xiaoshou would escape if she was a step slower. She was about to call for Wangze, the Holy Emperor, to follow her when her voice suddenly stopped..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
