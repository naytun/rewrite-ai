(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Abbot Youxi was clearly so fat. Didn’t he notice it at all?</p><p>Why did he always like to stay in such a high and dangerous place?</p><p>The young monk did not dare to ask.</p><p>He had asked the other masters before, but they always hit him on the head when he did that. It was very painful!</p><p>Abbot Youxi had a big belly, a white beard, and kind eyes, and the flesh on his cheeks always made him appear happy. He rubbed the little monk’s head with his big hand and said kindly.</p><p>“Got it, Xiao Baobei.”</p><p>“But you can’t come up. If the masters from the discipline hall sees you, they will punish you and order you to carry buckets of water for three days. Do you understand?”</p><p>“I’m not afraid if I am not injured. Now, I am able to carry heavy buckets of water for ten days in a row!” The little monk showed off the small muscles on his forearm.</p><p>“Monks don’t lie.”</p><p>“Abbot Youxi! I’m not lying!”</p><p>“Oh, are you really that strong? I don’t believe it. Why don’t you go carry one and show me?”</p><p>“Humph! I’ll go then!” The little monk wrinkled his nose and almost jumped down. He quickly realized that this activity would take up to ten days. He pouted and said angrily, “The abbot tricked me again. I don’t like you anymore!”</p><p>“Haha…” The abbot rubbed his head as he watched the sunset.</p><p>“Abbot, Abbot, why do you stand here every day, what are you looking for?” The little monk was puzzled.</p><p>“I’m watching the sunset.”</p><p>“The sunset is beautiful, but, but… What’s so good about watching the same thing every day?” The young monk stood with his arms akimbo as if he was an elder who lectured him.</p><p>The abbot smiled and said warmly, “I watch the sunset with my heart, and the evening glow watches him for me. My heart feels different every day, and the evening glow is also different every day. He had undergone a thousand Transformation. If he chooses to turn back, the evening glow will bring him home to me.”</p><p>“Abbot Youxi, who is this ‘he’?”</p><p>“Master You Yuan.”</p><p>“Ah! It was Senior Brother Bu Le’s Master! I know him. Isn’t he outside suppressing the great demon?”</p><p>“Yes, he’s suppressing a very, very big demon. He should have been home long ago.”</p><p>Abbot Youxi was chubby and the smile on his face had disappeared. His eyes that reflected the sunset, were filled with vicissitudes of life, and there was a hint of sadness in them. “He should have come home a long time ago…”</p><p>“Master You Yuan can’t come home? He can come back whenever he’s tired!” The little monk tilted his head and quickly clenched his fists. “I can help him suppress the great demon. I’ve become stronger!”</p><p>Abbot Youxi stroked his forehead and looked at the sunset. The sky became darker, and he only smiled and did not reply.</p><p>The little monk scratched his head again, but he quickly recalled the initial topic and asked worriedly.</p><p>“Pot-bellied Abbot, they said that Rao Yaoyao’s Saint Fall would have an impact. Will it affect us? The book said that we are very far away from the outside world.”</p><p>“It will.”</p><p>“Then what kind of impact would it have?”</p><p>Abbot Youxi didn’t respond, but squatted down.</p><p>The little monk looked at the shaky tiles behind him and was even more worried, but they did not die.</p><p>“Look.” The pot-bellied abbot squatted down and hugged the little monk. He pointed at the fading sky in the distance and said, “What will happen after sunset?”</p><p>“What will happen?” The little monk was puzzled.</p><p>“After sunset, the sky will change.”</p><p>“What? It would turn black? That simple? Then I know this question.</p><p>Pot-bellied Abbot, quick, ask me another question!”</p><p>“Alright, alright, alright. Then let me ask you, after sunset, when will it be dawn?”</p><p>“Uh… That’s not my question!”</p><p>“Then answer my more complicated question.” “Uh, let me think about it… The answer is tomorrow?”</p><p>Tomorrow?”</p><p>“Yes, tomorrow!”</p><p>“Hahaha, what a good tomorrow. That’s a good answer. Then let me ask you again, how should we spend the time from dark to dawn?”</p><p>“Sleep?”</p><p>“That’s good. What are you afraid of? Why aren’t you going to sleep?”</p><p>“Oh, sleep…Would everything become better after a nap? Will Master You Yuan come back too?”</p><p>“He will…” The evening breeze blew past Abbot Youxi’s long white beard, and he suddenly looked much older.</p><p>He looked at the black sky in the distance and stroked his beard with a smile.</p><p>“Life is like a dream. When you wake up from your slumber, tomorrow there will be a Transformation..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
