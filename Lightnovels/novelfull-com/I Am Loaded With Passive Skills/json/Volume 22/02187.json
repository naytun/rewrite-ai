(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>It was a time of reckoning!</p><p>The Disillusionment Finger and the power of the Holy Emperor formed an energy that could wipe out humans and Gods. It exploded at the back of the battlefield.</p><p>Just as Dao Qiongcang thought, this was a bolt of lightning!</p><p>When Wangze Holy Emperor first descended, he didn’t choose to erase it. He only used a method similar to banishment to imprison it temporarily.</p><p>In his world, this was too strenuous and unrewarding. It was also completely unnecessary.</p><p>He only needed to get rid of Xu Xiaoshou and the people of the Holy Divine Palace would have plenty of time to clean up the battlefield.</p><p>However, he didn’t expect that as a Holy Emperor, not only did he fail to kill Xu Xiaoshou, he was swallowed by him instead.</p><p>Then now…</p><p>Even Wangze Holy Emperor felt that it would take some effort to clean up this Finger of Annihilation when it first fell; its power was beyond doubt.</p><p>Now that the others were gone, the second explosion of this lightning had become an absolute killing move that no one could stop.</p><p>“Danger!”</p><p>The people below raised their heads in anticipation even as their eyes were filled with despair.</p><p>From Xu Xiaoshou’s battle with Wangze Holy Emperor, once the power of the Holy Emperor erupted, no one in this Land Realm would be able to escape.</p><p>Naturally, everyone lost the urge to flee and could only wait for death to descend.</p><p>Also, they had hopes that the outcome would take a turn for the better?</p><p>For example, Hallmaster Dao could still make a move, and a Holy Emperor might descend. Or maybe Xu Xiaoshou would take into account the safety of the fish in the pond and choose to stop at the critical moment?</p><p>No one paid any attention to them!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was only concerned about Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>However, before he could even make a move, the secondary plane door opened above his head.</p><p>The rules of the Spell Forbidden Barrier that belonged to the Inner Island were drawn out.</p><p>What followed was the voice of the invisible Water Ghost who had stayed hidden outside the battle.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou already had a murderous intent. Why do you have to struggle so much?”</p><p>At this moment, Dao Qiongcang could barely hear anything, and his eyes were filled with sadness.</p><p>He could not use his saint’s will, but his gaze swept across the entire Abyss</p><p>Island, as if he could see the arrival of ‘death’ under the guidance of the Seven Trees Emperor.</p><p>Everything had developed towards the worst possible outcome.</p><p>It was just like how he had seen Wangze Holy Emperor’s hesitation when he went to the Desolate Inferno Domain. He had thought that would be the end of the chess game.</p><p>“Bazhun’an, you are too ruthless…”</p><p>With a loud bang, Dao Qiongcang’s silent murmurs were extinguished.</p><p>The energy storm in the sky was like a beautiful epiphyllum that bloomed at night. It arrived a little late, but it bloomed in an instant.</p><p>Countless people wailed in grief in the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor’s Wind Gently Carries had indeed sent the Finger of Annihilation higher into the sky and it was no longer close to the surface.</p><p>Even so, the power of the Holy Emperor and the soul destruction power were unleashed at the same time.</p><p>The surging waves of pressure, each stronger than the last, still crushed the defenseless figures on the ground from afar.</p><p>“Bang! Bang! Bang!”</p><p>Blood flowers bloomed on the ruins of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>Even the Spiritual Cultivators who had hidden themselves in the ancient buildings and found some ancient defensive arrays were not spared.</p><p>The power of a Holy Emperor was no child’s play.</p><p>Even if it was just the aftershock, how could these ordinary Cutting Path and higher void resist it?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, it’s you again…”</p><p>Above the Nine Heavens, the storm drowned out the sound.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao, who had been teleported to the center of the storm by the Greater Teleportation Technique, never expected that the climax of the battle she had anticipated would come so quickly.</p><p>According to her prediction, she was already on her guard against the Seven Trees Emperor, the Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison and other strange powers, after Dao Qiongcang’s warning. It would take more than ten rounds before Xu Xiaoshou would be forced to his limit.</p><p>At that time, either Xu Xiaoshou would be exhausted and at the end of his tether, or Dao Qiongcang would be prepared to fight back.</p><p>However, the grenade buried in the back of the battlefield, coupled with Xu Xiaoshou’s Greater Teleportation Technique, destroyed all her hopes.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The defense of the Mountains and Seas Converge did not even last half a breath against the power of the Holy Emperor and the Disillusionment Finger.</p><p>The living creatures and dead souls that were used to stabilize the First Hall of Sins were all blown into dust and returned to nothingness.</p><p>The aura of destruction was like the wildest wind that Rao Yaoyao had ever seen when she first entered the Innate Stage. It whistled and roared in front of her.</p><p>Plants, mountains, ruins, space, laws… From material to formless, everything was being destroyed!</p><p>The heat wave that came toward her face that was not shielded, had not even exploded with the first wave of energy. Rao Yaoyao already felt that everything in her body had started to melt.</p><p>That included the dress on her body, the flesh on her face, her blood and bones, and even her soul…</p><p>Her vision soon blurred.</p><p>Her hearing deteriorated.</p><p>Her saint’s will ignited and was slowly burned, bit by bit.</p><p>Even as an ancient swordsman, her sword seemed to be completely shattered by this attack.</p><p>“Am I really going to die?”</p><p>In an instant, Rao Yaoyao’s mind was in a daze. All the memories of her past life flashed through her mind rapidly.</p><p>She was the proud daughter of the Heavens, the pride of the Holy Emperor Rao family, the leader of the red-clothed people and the peerless genius of Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>She was born with a golden spoon in her mouth. When she opened her eyes, she was the most dazzling pearl in the Shengshen Continent. She was among the list of stunning beauties and was peerless.</p><p>Her Innate Stage had awakened her wind attribute, and she had a strong affinity with it. Coupled with her unlimited resources, she had never encountered a bottleneck in her Spiritual Cultivation to being a higher void</p><p>She had plenty of time and wanted to cultivate the Ancient Sword Technique, so the Holy Emperor Rao found her the best teacher and the best place to cultivate..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
