(2)</h1><p>Chapter 2126: How Dare You Provoke Me? Disrespecting Invincible? (2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio     Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>A demi-saint ancient swordsman’s combat strength could not be compared to an ordinary demi-saint, even if Rao Yaoyao was just a demi-saint.</p><p>And with this type of brains, even if Rao Yaoyao’s combat strength was maximized, it would be impossible for it to be used by others.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had gone crazy. He had the power of a Holy Emperor.</p><p>However, external power was still external power. It was already quite good that he was able to use 10,000 to 20,000 percent of the power of a Holy Emperor.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao used her Fire Power and went all out. She might not be unable to block Xu Xiaoshou’s attack. Moreover, she didn’t need to meet him head-on. She could just use the kite flying tactics.</p><p>It just so happened that during this period of time, he and Water Ghost had restrained each other, and this would suppress them to death.</p><p>This way, the situation would be out of control and Bazhun’an would be at his wits’ end.</p><p>And there was still the Si Wu Formation on Abyss Island. No matter how chaotic it was, Dao Qiongcang was confident that it would end well.</p><p>Thus, at this moment, Dao Qiongcang felt relieved when he saw that Rao Yaoyao could enter the arena.</p><p>“I am very calm.”</p><p>After Rao Yaoyao took a deep breath, her pretty face became calm.</p><p>She seemed to be furious, but she was actually extremely vigilant. After all, she had learned a lot from her past mistakes and did not dare to act rashly like before.</p><p>If you move, you’ll lose.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was conceited, but she wasn’t conceited enough to think that she could replace Dao Qiongcang as the tactical leader.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou finally turned around and looked at her with a hint of mischief in his eyes.</p><p>“Cutie Rao?”</p><p>With just this form of address, not only was Rao Yaoyao’s body set ablaze by the white flames, but the fury in her heart also soared.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you’re courting death!”</p><p>The Sword Will on Rao Yaoyao’s body rumbled. She almost couldn’t suppress her anger and drew her sword.</p><p>The two most annoying and despicable men in the world, Water Ghost and Xu Xiaoshou, were in front of her.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the constant reminder in her mind not to be impulsive, Rao Yaoyao really wanted to rush up and slash this white flame man with her sword!</p><p>“Ke ke, you are courting death…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lowered his head and chuckled. He watched as Rao Yaoyao’s body disappeared into the void, but even her Great Path was ignited.</p><p>Even a grand sword saint couldn’t shake off the infernal white flame.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and destroyed the saint calamity. He mocked her.</p><p>“Cutie Rao, if it was before, I would have respected a sword saint like you a little.”</p><p>“But now, even Dao Qiongcang doesn’t dare to speak to me like that. You are not worthy to spout nonsense in front of me!”</p><p>These words were spoken softly at the beginning, but in the end, they were filled with the intent of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>In an instant, the monstrous aura surged like a tidal wave that crashed against the shore. It was even more ferocious than the supreme saint calamity and made everyone present feel dizzy and their expressions changed.</p><p>“This brat…’</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was too shocked to say anything. Water Ghost who was in his body, could not stand it any longer.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had no strength, was submissive. Xu Xiaoshou, who had gained power, attacked heavily.</p><p>‘A villain who had achieved success’ was a phrase that could not quite describe him. How could this guy make both his enemies and his own people so disgusted?</p><p>“+(Criticized, Passive Points+)+1221” “+(Feared, Passive Points+) +866.”</p><p>“+(Glared at, Passive Points+)+231.”</p><p>When the Information Bar popped up, Rao Yaoyao was so angry that her chest heaved violently and her face was pale.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>However, she was too well brought up to use any vicious curses to retort to such a detestable person. She could only glare at him and draw her sword. “You’re too good to be true, Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“Wait.”</p><p>However, the white flames surged forward and Xu Xiaoshou pushed forward with his hand. His leisurely and calm manner contained an unquestionable aura.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao subconsciously put down her hand and her sword, and released the anger in her heart.</p><p>It was as if nothing in the world was more important than what Xu Xiaoshou was about to say.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>When she realized that Xu Xiaoshou was able to affect her with his aura alone,</p><p>Rao Yaoyao became even more furious.</p><p>But at this moment, Xu Xiaoshou spoke.</p><p>He stepped on the white sea of fire, and with the support of his supreme aura, it really seemed as if the Holy Emperor had possessed his whole being. He looked regal and powerful.</p><p>“Cutie Rao, don’t say that I didn’t give you a chance. If you stop now and leave</p><p>Abyss Island, I won’t attack you.”</p><p>“But remember, the reason why I spared your life wasn’t because you’re cute,</p><p>but because your surname is Rao.”</p><p>“You let my Teacher go previously. I owe you a favor. You can leave.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked down from above. He raised his chin slightly, supported his left hand on the flowing white flame, and waved the famed sword Flame Python with his right hand. He was a clear example of what arrogance was.</p><p>The only thing he did not do was to summon the Pavilion in the Sky and transform it into the moon and cut a lonely figure in the sky.</p><p>However, only Xu Xiaoshou himself knew the pain he suffered. Even his body trembled under his robe!</p><p>But at this moment, Xu Xiaoshou held it in firmly as he controlled his muscles through the Transformation.</p><p>He could let others see that he was actually very weak. It would be a lie if Xu Xiaoshou said he was not afraid of the Rao Clan, that was one of the five aristocratic families of the Holy Emperor!</p><p>“Too arrogant, this guy is too arrogant. I can’t stand it!”</p><p>“But he’s a Holy Emperor now, even if it’s only for a moment. If I can obtain the power of a Holy Emperor and still survive, I’ll be a hundred times crazier than him!”</p><p>“Indeed. If I could achieve half of what Xu Xiaoshou had achieved by the age of 20, I would walk with my nose in the air!”</p><p>“It’s over. Fairy Rao definitely can’t take it. Xu Xiaoshou’s goading method might be too clumsy, but it came in useful…”</p><p>Even Water Ghost in Dao Qiongcang’s body felt ashamed of what he had done, let alone the Spiritual Cultivators below.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had not lost his senses!</p><p>He was still alert!</p><p>With such power in his hands, ordinary people would be arrogant. He even knew how to irk Rao Yaoyao and made it easier to fight with the enemy….</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
