Even he could tell that Water Ghost was struggling.</p><p>Water-type Upanishad against Celestial Scroll…</p><p>Sea God’s Trident against Divine Sinan…</p><p>Aside from the newly acquired Original Sealing Spear that he had not yet mastered, could Water Ghost, no matter his trump cards, truly overpower Dao Qiongcang of the Ten High Nobles?</p><p>Moreover, Dao Qiongcang was known for being enigmatic and unpredictable. Would he not have more tricks up his sleeve? Would he enter the Arena without being fully prepared?</p><p>Within the battle.</p><p>The fight for the demi-saint title of Rao Yaoyao was momentarily halted by Dao Qiongcang’s two strikes of “Great Stripping Technique,” which subdued Water Ghost as they exchanged words.</p><p>Everyone found themselves caught in Dao Qiongcang’s questioning of the current situation, and even Water Ghost appeared bewildered after being thrown into the air.</p><p>“While the Saint Servant conducted the operation of unsealing the Inner Island on Abyss Island, they still have other plans on the Shengshen Continent. What do they aim to do in Hallmaster Dao’s absence?”</p><p>The spectators were filled with deep apprehension, feeling that many of their prior thoughts had been confined to the realm of the Abyss Island. They had nearly forgotten that the Shengshen Continent was the main battleground for Saint Servant and the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>Shortly after Dao Qiongcang posed the question, Divine Elf Qi gave a start, leaping off his shoulder, flapping its wings frantically, and urgently exclaimed:</p><p>“Elder Dao, Elder Dao, various branch temples of the Holy Divine Palace across the five domains of the continent are under attack!”</p><p>“There are currently thirty-six instances, but the number is still increasing.”</p><p>“Furthermore, unexpected incidents have occurred in the Northern Region’s Heavenly Covenant, the Southern Region’s Black Heart Fruit Clan, and the Central Region’s City of the Dead Bodhisattva.”</p><p>“That vile Saint Servant has indeed taken action while you’re gone!”</p><p>Shock spread across the island with this revelation.</p><p>Had they truly been ambushed?</p><p>Did the Saint Servant really make a move?</p><p>Was Saint Servant truly launching a direct, frontal assault on the Holy Divine Palace?</p><p>It had been years since any dark faction dared to challenge the Holy Divine Palace openly.</p><p>The First-in-Command Saint Servant, Bazhun’an, indeed bore the heart of a warrior, and his declaration of war was far from mere words!</p><p>“It seems my guess was correct…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang murmured before Water Ghost could respond. He had found the answer.</p><p>Water Ghost had already retrieved his Sea God’s Trident in mid-air after being hurtled away by the Great Stripping Technique.</p><p>He had not spoken a word, as if afraid of revealing any more information.</p><p>He also refrained from taking further action. Instead, his face bore an expression of uncertainty, as if he were contemplating something.</p><p>Everyone could see that, after the brief clash, Water Ghost was extremely wary of Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>This had reached a level of extreme caution, far removed from the arrogance he initially displayed upon entering the Arena.</p><p>“Elder Dao, what should we do next?” Xiao Qi circled Dao Qiongcang’s head with a great sense of urgency.</p><p>“If I can anticipate their moves, I would surely have my own countermeasures. Saint Servant won’t be able to stir up a storm,” Dao Qiongcang cryptically remarked.</p><p>Deep in thought, Xu Xiaoshou watched the battle with unblinking eyes.</p><p>Had Dao Qiongcang anticipated and prepared for the disturbances in the Shengshen Continent?</p><p>Or did he know about Water Ghost’s actions on Abyss Island and had a backup plan in place?</p><p>“Indeed, the ghost beasts had crept forth before the barriers between Inner Island and Outer Island were nearly breached.”</p><p>“But since Dao Qiongcang entered the battle, the anomalies on Inner Island have completely disappeared. Not even a phantom of a ghost beast can be seen…”</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang had done something!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized with a sense of delayed insight, feeling as though his thoughts were influenced by the power of guidance.</p><p>He contemplated whether Dao Qiongcang’s words referred not to one aspect but both scenarios.</p><p>“Does he need my help?”</p><p>Watching the Water Ghost being pushed into a defensive position, Xu Xiaoshou felt that it was once again his moment to take action.</p><p>But just as he thought of intervening, the momentarily slowing battlefield in the Arena erupted once more.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>Water Ghost had paused for a mere moment.</p><p>After realizing he could not take the demi-saint title from Rao Yaoyao, he retreated decisively, brandishing his Sea God’s Trident, causing countless ink-black waterspouts to surge into the sky.</p><p>“Boom, boom, boom, boom!”</p><p>From all directions of Abyss Island, countless waterspouts rose to the sky like towering pillars.</p><p>All the black waterspouts exploded in an instant, transforming into numerous Water Ghosts, plummeting toward various locations on Abyss Island, not limited to the nine extreme grounds, in various peculiar and bizarre postures.</p><p>“What is he trying to do?”</p><p>Everyone wondered simultaneously, but the answer quickly dawned on them.</p><p>To fight Dao Qiongcang, the Water Ghost needed to attain sanctification.</p><p>Thus, this was a prelude to the sanctification!</p><p>Sure enough, every Water Ghost clone scattered across Abyss Island simultaneously executed the same action.</p><p>Each took out a demi-saint title and squeezed out a drop of blood, attempting to fuse with it.</p><p>“How do we distinguish the real Water Ghost among so many?”</p><p>All the Water Ghosts detected by Xu Xiaoshou within his “Perception” range were fake.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
