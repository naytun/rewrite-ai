They had met a formless being and had been asked to capture a disciple.</p><p>What happened after that was unbearable to recall.</p><p>Mortals were still too troublesome. The questions they asked were all repetitive.</p><p>Bazhun’an had started off by telling him everything he knew, then remained patient and finally lapsed into silent understanding.</p><p>He had already experienced so much!</p><p>Repeatedly explaining to others why one plus one equals two, and why one plus two equals three was just torture to him.</p><p>However, these people would always ask their questions. Even if he already said it, they would still be puzzled. When he gave an answer, they would still have questions.</p><p>Bazhun’an couldn’t re-define some problems that were already at the bottom level. He couldn’t understand the structure of these people’s minds.</p><p>He turned his insights into a simple sentence, a simple sword for people to comprehend.</p><p>He no longer kept his mouth shut, but he was put on a pedestal by others and made some condescending remarks.</p><p>Until the end…</p><p>Some people presented him with jade and precious stones in return for an explanation.</p><p>Some people tried to use their swords to force him to explain.</p><p>However, if the world and the people of the world were to be fulfilled, then when would Bazhun’an have any time left for himself?</p><p>With all these chatter and ongoing activities, I don’t feel that I’m an immortal in Heaven.</p><p>Half a poem, some wine, half a sword, Gods, demons and ghosts, and thousands of years of learning.</p><p>What a pity…</p><p>The world worshipped him but no one understood him.</p><p>The Blood World was not the Blood World, and the Hurricane Belt was not the Hurricane Belt.</p><p>They were completely different from the two people who could leisurely discuss about the Dao outside the Forest of Miracles.</p><p>On one of the nine extreme grounds that had been shattered, the only winner, Xu Xiaoshou lifted Fourth Sword and roared into the sky, full of vigor.</p><p>He had crushed the Holy Emperor!</p><p>He even stabbed Vicious Sword into the other party’s remnant will!</p><p>The outcome of this battle had already been decided. Even if he had borrowed external power, Rao Wangze was still a bully.</p><p>In this way, we were evenly matched, and I won this battle.</p><p>Awesome!</p><p>As for those who were not swordsmen, to them Fourth Sword seemed possessed by a demon. Xu Xiaoshou could only imagine Rao Wangze’s tragic ending.</p><p>However, he had not lost all his rationality. After all, there was Yu Ling before… Oh, and the lesson learned from Water Ghost.</p><p>Therefore, whether Rao Wangze’s Dao heart was strong, Xu Xiaoshou chose to trust Rao Wangze to be on the safe side.</p><p>“Rao Wangze, do you have any last words?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou asked cautiously as he faced the black Devil’s Will.</p><p>Chi chi sizzle…</p><p>Devilish energy scattered everywhere, and Wangze Holy Emperor seemed unable to escape.</p><p>In other words, he could already tell that even if he escaped, he was no match for Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Being captured repeatedly was even more shameful than being defeated once.</p><p>At this moment, Wangze Holy Emperor made his final decision.</p><p>“Dao! Qiong! Gang!”</p><p>The sonorous Saint Language echoed throughout the entire arena.</p><p>He did not say anything, but after he finished his sentence, Rao Wangze chose to ignite the remnant of his Holy Emperor will.</p><p>Outside the ruins of the First Hall of Sins, Dao Qiongcang frowned. He clearly wanted to stay out of this.</p><p>However, he had no choice but to listen to Wangze Holy Emperor’s final roar.</p><p>He sacrificed the power of the Holy Emperor and fused it with the Si Wu Formation and used the Divine Secret to seal Abyss island once more.</p><p>This match was definitely over!</p><p>After he returned to the Shengshen Continent, Xu Xiaoshou had already caught the eye of the Holy Emperor. No one could guarantee his life or death.</p><p>“Sigh.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang sighed and finally picked up the divine Sinan as he planned to join the fray.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou didn’t give him a chance!</p><p>He had long been on guard. When he heard that, he roared and the green chains around him surged forth</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Beside the White Tiger gate, the Frost Ferret let out an ear-piercing cry. The vast suppressive force of a Holy Emperor entered Xu Xiaoshou’s body through the Four Divine Pillars.</p><p>“Bang bang!”</p><p>This time, there was no Taoist music or anything else.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s body turned into an illusory green prison that covered the sky.</p><p>Chains of order shot out from all directions and pierced into Wangze Holy Emperor’s body. He was tied up and resembled a chain dumpling.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>With a few rumbles, the green chains pulled back and dragged the Holy Emperor’s Remorse into the depths of the dark prison.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s body returned to its Berserk Giant form.</p><p>Everyone watched as the Holy Emperor’s Remorse entered Xu Xiaoshou’s energy reserve. It then entered the Frost Ferret’s body through the power of the Four Divine Pillars.</p><p>“Gulp!”</p><p>The Frost Ferret that covered the sky swallowed something.</p><p>The aura of Wangze Holy Emperor’s remnant will completely disappeared from Abyss Island.</p><p>“It was eaten up?”</p><p>Countless people were terrified.</p><p>If Wangze Holy Emperor was killed, the outcome would be considered good for now.</p><p>However, being imprisoned by this incomparably mysterious green prison…</p><p>Could the other party use this Holy Emperor’s Remorse to exert an influence on Wangze Holy Emperor’s body?</p><p>When one thought carefully about it, one was afraid!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou won the battle on Abyss Island and the Holy Emperor was captured?</p><p>NO!</p><p>After he took down Wangze Holy Emperor, Xu Xiaoshou laughed sinisterly like a rabid dog. He turned to the First Hall of Sins and said. “Very good. Rao Wangze already said that you’re next…”</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
