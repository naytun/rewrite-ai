Bazhun’an then appeared from there.</p><p>What did he do in there…”</p><p>“When Abyss Island descended, Bazhun’an said that they would cover for me. Water Ghost and Dao Qiongcang suddenly became wary of me after their arrival…” “The so-called power that can resist the power of the Heavenly Ancestor?”</p><p>“Is me?”</p><p>“No! It’s him!”</p><p>On the dragon’s head, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly raised his eyes and stared at the Heavenly Ancestor Light that was frozen in mid-air. A bright light flashed in his eyes.</p><p>He understood!</p><p>“You should have said so earlier. It turned out that I am the strongest person on Abyss Island…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stepped on the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s head and leapt out.</p><p>Under the countless shocked gazes, he directly faced the Heavenly Ancestor Light and tried to resist the power of the ancestral source with his human body.</p><p>“Flame Python!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hovered in the air. Under the suspended saint calamity, he stretched his right hand into the void.</p><p>The famed sword, Flame Python, flew out of the Yuan Mansion and trembled violently before it flew onto his hand.</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>At this moment, the world stopped, but everyone heard sword cries that seemed to be filled with ecstasy, gratification, and a surge of emotions.</p><p>Flame Python showed the way!</p><p>Flame Python had just expressed its feelings of being re-used. It finally did not have to be suppressed by Fourth Sword!</p><p>Just like when he first arrived at Abyss Island, it guided Xu Xiaoshou to a certain place to find the hidden treasure.</p><p>From what Xu Xiaoshou knew, it should be the hidden treasure left behind by the wretched saint, the Great Infernal Ancestor.</p><p>Now, Xu Xiaoshou finally gained enlightenment.</p><p>So the location of the hidden treasure was right under his feet!</p><p>“Sorry, I’m late…”</p><p>It was better to be there at the right time even if it was late!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stood up and stroked the sword with his fingers.</p><p>Under the Witness Sword Technique, for every inch of sword cognition that penetrated Flame Python’s sword body the Sword Will of this famed sword would increase by more than one point.</p><p>Under the surprised gazes of Dao Qiongcang and the others, Xu Xiaoshou’s movements were slow, yet he still walked to the end.</p><p>When he moved two fingers across Flame Python’s body, the white bead left behind by the wretched saint in his mind seemed to have sensed something.</p><p>“Yes…”</p><p>It let out another quivering sound.</p><p>Just like in the White Cave, at an interval of ten minutes, it would chime and report the time.</p><p>At this moment, it was the same decadent sound, but the meaning behind this sound this time round was so different.</p><p>It was clearly a backup plan left behind by Bazhun’an, otherwise, how could it be Bazhun’an’s voice?</p><p>It was clearly what Bazhun’an and the wretched saint of the Inner Island, the Ultimate Grand Ancestor of the Great Infernal Ancestor, had discussed.</p><p>At a certain time and place, a certain condition would be triggered, and the white bead would be able to truly display its effects.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had to reveal this card.</p><p>“Here it goes then!”</p><p>When he felt the vibration of the white bead, Xu Xiaoshou instantly knew the solution to this problem.</p><p>His heart tightened, and his sword cognition slashed out. It easily sliced through the white bead that was unbreakable before and tried to break free from its restraints.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Under everyone’s gaze, the Desolate Inferno Domain exploded with a loud sound. White flames spread throughout for tens of thousands of miles.</p><p>These white flames were extremely sticky and flowed like lava, just like the white flame world he had entered when he first met the wretched saint.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stood above the white flames with Flame Python in his hand. His aura rose steadily, and the spiritual source of his energy reserve surged inch by inch.</p><p>It was almost about to erupt from his body!</p><p>“This brat…”</p><p>The first person to be released from the restriction of the Time Ancestor</p><p>Shadow Staff was not Dao Qiongcang, but the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon shook its head and broke free from the spacetime confinement. However, he sensed the layers of transformation on Xu Xiaoshou’s body.</p><p>This human kid’s aura had gone from being inconspicuous to being absolutely real and eye-catching. Then, it went to the Sovereign Dao Realm, Cutting Path Stage, higher void level and demi-saint…</p><p>It continued to climb!</p><p>“How was that possible?”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was dumbfounded.</p><p>It could sense the pure power of the Great Infernal Ancestor within Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>Were the dragon’s eyes dim?</p><p>Impossible!</p><p>That was one of its sworn enemies on the Inner Island. How could it be wrong? Moreover, they had just fought!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A thunderclap resounded in the void.</p><p>However, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon sensed that there was an additional power in Xu Xiaoshou’s body that belonged to itself .</p><p>That was…</p><p>“My dragon scale?”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was stunned.</p><p>It saw the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale that broke through Xu Xiaoshou’s Yuan Mansion and it flashed with the power of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>That kind of power easily blocked the saint calamity that mortals would encounter when they broke through the shackles of a demi-saint.</p><p>“I’m at work?”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon looked stunned… It suddenly recalled that when it met Bazhun’an on the Inner Island, Bazhun’an had asked for three dragon scales.</p><p>On one of them, he had deliberately added on multiple powers.</p><p>This included, but was not limited to, defensive power, that could block a strike from a low level Holy Emperor.</p><p>Shielding power-it could temporarily block the prying of the saint calamity and the Emperor’s Tribulation to prevent their descent.</p><p>The power of forgetfulness-even the Holy Emperor couldn’t remember the dragon scale, only the wielder could.</p><p>“This dragon scale is with Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon finally realized that it had been bound to Xu Xiaoshou for a long time!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Another sound rang out in the void. It was a sign that the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation was about to appear.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s body swelled up completely, as if he had been injected with an irresistible force.</p><p>White flames erupted from his body in an endless stream that resembled thick lava.</p><p>White flames bloomed under his feet, as resplendent as lotuses.</p><p>His hair and clothes were dyed white by the flames…</p><p>At this moment, he resembled a fire God who had emerged from the white flames. He held the famed sword Flame Python, and looked like the master of the world..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
