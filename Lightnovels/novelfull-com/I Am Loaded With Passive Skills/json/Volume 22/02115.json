(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“As for the standpoint of the Holy Divine Palace and the Holy Palace, you can tell my disciple about them. He is one of the five great authorities, and I am just a wanderer.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang waved his hand to cut off the saint calamity. He stared intently and was about to speak.</p><p>“Two!” Mu Ling interrupted again.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>If he was still the Dao Qiongcang, one of the Ten High Nobles, with the backing of the Dao Clan, he would not fear any pressure.</p><p>However, he was now Hallmaster Dao, and his words and actions affected the lives of millions of people. He could no longer act arbitrarily.</p><p>Even so, he said indifferently, “Bai Lian was wrong. He should never have collaborated with the Saint Servant. Justice…”</p><p>Mu Ling pretended not to hear it and scoffed, “There are tens of millions of righteous soldiers. The Infernal lineage is passed down from generation to generation. Whoever dares to kill my disciple, I dare to bury them together!”</p><p>This was…</p><p>A scholar met a soldier!</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators on Abyss Island had a new understanding of the Infernal lineage.</p><p>Even if you have thousands of reasons and a tongue like a lotus flower, I only recognize one principle. If you dare to touch me, I dare to turn hostile.</p><p>However, he still had the strength.</p><p>He was really tenacious No wonder he could nurture such a character like Xu Xiaoshou… Countless people exclaimed in their hearts.</p><p>“One!”</p><p>Mu Ling shouted the last number and Dao Qiongcang let out a long sigh.</p><p>He was not like Bazhun’an who had no scruples and did whatever he wanted.</p><p>If you practiced justice, you would be bound by the rules, and it would be difficult to do all kinds of things in a small place.</p><p>“Divine Thirty-Six Form, Great Shielding Technique!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang shifted the star dipper, and the patterns on the divine Sinan moved. A beam of light flew out and shot towards Bai Lian.</p><p>He chose to take a step back.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>A strange sound rang out in the air.</p><p>From its name the Great Shielding Technique, everyone knew that Hallmaster Dao really had the means to block the supreme saint calamity.</p><p>This was also why he dared to personally induce the change in the supreme saint calamity.</p><p>However, when the starlight flew past and hit Bai Lian, the saint calamity only stopped for a moment before it continued its bombardment!</p><p>“Boom boom boom…”</p><p>Mu Ling was enraged.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang only pretended to take action. He still resisted the triple saint calamity.</p><p>“Look, Hallmaster Dao only pretended to attack.” Li Fugui shouted excitedly.</p><p>“Kid, you’re the number one figure in the Holy Divine Palace, right? In that instant just now, you clearly had the power of the secondary plane door.”</p><p>“In my opinion, it was Water Ghost who attacked and triggered the Spell Forbidden Barrier and suppressed Hallmaster Dao’s help just now.”</p><p>“Is that so?” Everyone fell into deep thought. Water Ghost was submerged in the lightning, and most people did not see Water Ghost make a move.</p><p>Li Fugui shouted excitedly again, “Hallmaster Dao, you helped openly, but you secretly colluded with Water Ghost to trick Mu Ling. This plan is flawless, and it did not tarnish your reputation of being unpredictable. Tsk tsk, awesome!</p><p>That’s really something!”</p><p>“You brat…” Everyone was shocked.</p><p>On the battlefield, Dao Qiongcang was affected by the secondary plane door.</p><p>Once again, he realized that a large part of the reason why Water Ghost dared to set up a trap on Abyss Island was that he controlled the secondary plane door. This was his home ground!</p><p>“Water! Ghost!” Mu Ling went mad and let out a cry of pain.</p><p>With a bang, Water Ghost emerged from the lightning.</p><p>He held onto the golden beast mask calmly. The bloody hole in his chest had already healed.</p><p>His gaze swept past Mu Ling, and without a pause, he looked at Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>There was no doubt that Mu Ling was a genius.</p><p>After he studied the Penetrating Divine Senses 2.0 and mastered the mutated Internal Heavenly Flames, he would naturally be a powerful figure atter he underwent sanctification.</p><p>However, even though he was a genius in the eyes of ordinary people, he was a waste in Water Ghost’s eyes!</p><p>“Master, mutation…”</p><p>Such an unreliable power was obtained by chance. Even if he became a demi-saint, it would be difficult for him to become someone great! If Sleeveless was here, Water Ghost would have given him face.</p><p>Mu Ling?</p><p>Forget it!</p><p>Such ‘geniuses’ abounded everywhere in the circle of Water Ghost ‘s former identity, Yu Mo.</p><p>If he, Water Ghost gave face to every single one of them, even Bazhun’an would look down on him!</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, if I knew you had the Great Shielding Technique, I would have specially prepared the secondary plane door for you.”</p><p>“Think about it carefully. The late stage of the supreme saint calamity. Can a weakling like you, who can’t even comprehend the Upanishad, withstand it?”</p><p>Water Ghost ignored Mu Ling and smiled mockingly at Dao Qiongcang. The Power Upanishad Formation lit up the entire island.</p><p>Once he achieved sanctification, he would tell the world what true Spiritual Cultivation was!</p><p>In this era, the Ancient Sword Technique and Divine Secret were unorthodox.</p><p>He, Water Ghost, would not give anyone face today!</p><p>When the water-type Power Upanishad Formation lit up again, it rained down like thunder, as if it announced to the world:</p><p>Who was the actual protagonist on Abyss Island!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
