Instead, his skin began to burn, releasing waves of heat and steam throughout his body.</p><p>This was not the infernal white flame but rather an acceleration of blood flow to its extreme.</p><p>A fissure appeared on his back.</p><p>A branch, adorned with a single blood-red leaf, extended from it. As it began to grow, Xu the Beast lost control.</p><p>“The moment of the hunt!”</p><p>With a swoosh, Xu Xiaoshou smirked and vanished into the Holy Path.</p><p>Even he himself was uncertain why he made such a move.</p><p>But at this moment, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he was not the only one controlling this body.</p><p>There was a mysterious power guiding him on what to do, how to strike, how to go mad and vent, epitomizing the power of blood.</p><p>“Hum!”</p><p>The blood-red sky tainted the power of the dark world.</p><p>Even those far in the First Hall of Sins smelled the scent of blood intensifying beneath their feet.</p><p>Subconsciously, everyone’s eyes flashed with a red glow, feeling as if they had plunged into a sea of corpses and blood.</p><p>The primal desire to dominate almost overwhelmed their hearts, but instead of tormenting them, it set them free.</p><p>“What’s happening?”</p><p>Someone, in a state of shock, returned to their senses, looking down to find nothing but solid ground beneath their feet—no Blood Sea, no corpses, no wreckage!</p><p>But as they raised their eyes… The sky turned crimson!</p><p>“Hum!”</p><p>The faint glow of red spread across the entire Abyss Island.</p><p>By the Vermilion Bird Gate, Five Decays of Heaven and Man, now completely covered in blood, had lost consciousness.</p><p>The Seven Trees Emperor, domineering and unreasonable, did not give any chance for negotiation. He was mercilessly squeezing the potential of Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou conceived the idea of using the power of the blood tree, Five Decays of Heaven and Man lowered his head.</p><p>He died.</p><p>The next moment, his limp head suddenly jerked up.</p><p>He came back to life.</p><p>Blood-colored light burst from the eyes of Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>He sacrificed himself and empowered Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Thirst, the beginning of the bestial nature!”</p><p>The deep and hoarse chants of the Saint Language echoed through the Abyss Island.</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor, who had entered the intangible state, felt a surge of impulse in his mind.</p><p>That power was not unstoppable, but in the Abyss Island, constrained by the rules and the resistance of the Abyss Island Spirit, Wangze Holy Emperor could not consecutively take action.</p><p>This weakness was now magnified infinitely!</p><p>As Wangze Holy Emperor regained his senses, he felt something was wrong.</p><p>He intended to escape to Azure Marsh.</p><p>However, as soon as he came out of the Order of the Great Path, he saw a deep sword mark and the scene of the Blood Sea split in half.</p><p>—Blood World!</p><p>“No, this is the power of guidance…”</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor’s eyes tightened, and his scalp tingled.</p><p>The scene was too horrifying!</p><p>Blood World could be considered as the lair of the Seven Trees Emperor on the Outer Island. What was the difference between escaping here and throwing oneself into a trap?</p><p>Just as he was about to escape again, his spiritual will trembled. A red glow flashed in Wangze Holy Emperor’s eyes, and the desire to go wild surged in his mind.</p><p>“What if I just ‘clash’ with him?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou may be invincible with the power of the Four Holy Emperors, but he is fundamentally weak.”</p><p>“I just need to confront him head-on. His internal power will be muddled, and he will collapse from within…”</p><p>“Wow!” As this thought crossed his mind, a strange wolf howl resounded in his ears.</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor suddenly woke up, but he knew the timing had already passed.</p><p>He was controlled!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had caught up to him!</p><p>His speed was not slower than his own, and the Seven Trees Emperor’s all-encompassing mind control had successfully magnified his inner obsession, controlling him twice.</p><p>“Then let’s clash!”</p><p>“Bring it on!”</p><p>Since it had come, we embraced it.</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor, instead, became calm.</p><p>The Wind Rites Sutra flipped through his hands, settling on the most violent final chapter.</p><p>“Song of the Departed Moon!”</p><p>With a resounding blast, the rules of Blood World completely collapsed.</p><p>From all directions, past and present, a wind song echoed like the cries of ghosts and wolves, as if thousands of giant blades were slashing, shattering the Path Principles completely.</p><p>For tens of thousands of miles, the Blood Sea churned. As the Song of the Departed Moon descended, it pulverized the Blood Sea.</p><p>With a single blow, the structure of Blood World was perfectly rewritten. No longer a scene of a Blood Sea and a mountain of corpses, it became a pure hurricane zone.</p><p>If the nine extreme grounds of the Abyss Island were set at this moment, “Blood World” would have been removed from the list, and the “Hurricane Belt” would have led to a new chapter.</p><p>Emerging from the Holy Path, Xu Xiaoshou, who had entered the Hurricane Belt, naturally endured the invasion of all chaotic storms.</p><p>“Hiss, hiss…”</p><p>Countless cracks instantly appeared on his body, as if he had entered a wind attribute close-bounds force field, where scars and blood intertwined and bloomed.</p><p>The black dragon scales covering his body could withstand the attacks of ten, a hundred, a thousand wind blades.</p><p>But in this Hurricane Belt, the frequency of attacks was so high that it was impossible to count!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou entered it alone, his dragon-scale armor turning into fragments in an instant.</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points +9999.”</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points +9999.”</p><p>The Information Bar overflowed with pop-ups. The pain Xu Xiaoshou endured at this moment was also pushed to the extreme.</p><p>But under the stimulation of the Seven Trees Emperor’s insatiable desire, the pain did not make him retreat. Instead, it heightened his bloodthirst.</p><p>Just like Cen Qiaofu in the Eighth Palace, who dared to fight hundreds of individuals from the Cutting Path stages and higher void levels with a single Blood Tree’s Yin Branch.</p><p>The courage of an ordinary man was not shameful when breaking through the heavens made him a hero!</p><p>“Rao! Wang! ze!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were about to burst, and he let out a heart-wrenching roar, indicating that his obsession with killing at this moment had become madness.</p><p>Facing Wangze Holy Emperor, he threw a punch into the air.</p><p>Within the fist, the power of Ember Heart, Three Days Frozen Calamity, Little Blue Flower of the Tranquil Lake, sword cognition, Holy Power, and the Four Holy Emperors were compressed!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
