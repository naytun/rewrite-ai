(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Dao Qiongcang saw the confusion on Xu Xiaoshou’s face and concluded that even Xu Xiaoshou himself might not have been aware about this card.</p><p>It was very funny.</p><p>If that was the outcome, it could be established.</p><p>“From Bazhun’an?”</p><p>The divine Sinan moved as he tried to figure out what was inside the lightning that flickered.</p><p>Not long after, Dao Qiong Cang saw something. He looked at the shattered volcano below and his pupils constricted.</p><p>On the other side, Xu Xiaoshou was still deep in thought.</p><p>“That’s right, Water Ghost owed me a favor…”</p><p>“No, it seems like I owe him.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought about this repeatedly, but he still couldn’t understand why Water Ghost was so magnanimous.</p><p>The only reason he could think of was that they were allies from the same camp.</p><p>“Since that’s the case, don’t let any outsiders interfere with your battle.” Xu Xiaoshou said.</p><p>He didn’t explicitly refer to Mu Ling, but who on Abyss Island wasn’t a shrewd person?</p><p>This time, the Holy Palace had fallen into a trap and needed the Saint Servant to save them. After all this, they might have to spend a lot of time to explain.</p><p>“You guys?” Water Ghost laughed. “Xu Xiaoshou, don’t forget that you’re also a Saint Servant!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you don’t have to be.” Dao Qiongcang suddenly said.</p><p>The two of them treated the supreme saint calamity as if it was nothing and could still spar with each other. This was a sharp contrast to Mu Ling’s miserable state.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face suddenly darkened.</p><p>He couldn’t understand why Water Ghost and Dao Qiongcang were afraid of him.</p><p>However, their actions meant that they had indeed stood up, although the reason was still unknown.</p><p>But in this world, was there a need to delve into so many ‘whys’?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stood on the dragon’s head and skillfully took advantage of the momentum. He pointed at Dao Qiongcang and shouted coldly.</p><p>“Stop talking nonsense!”</p><p>“What are you waiting for?” He pointed at Water Ghost again and said with a gloomy expression. “If you are not going to save him, are you waiting for me to beat you up?</p><p>Good fellow!</p><p>All the spectators were stunned by Xu Xiaoshou’s sudden unyielding attitude. Even Dao Qiongcang and Water Ghost’s expressions changed.</p><p>You’re still keeping up the pretense?</p><p>“+(Glared at, Passive Points, +)+2.”</p><p>However, they only glared at him in anger. Surprisingly, the two did not refute him.</p><p>“In exchange, you have to be my guardian.” The muscles on Water Ghost’s face twitched with a fake smile.</p><p>Guardian?</p><p>What kind of protection can I give you? You should get Bazhun’an to be your guardian!</p><p>Before Xu Xiaoshou could retort, Water Ghost had already sprung into action.</p><p>He flipped his palm and the secondary plane door opened.</p><p>At the same time, the phantom of an ancient door appeared above Mu Ling’s head. The secondary plane door enveloped the saint calamity and showed how it managed to cut off the saint calamity before.</p><p>Now, its power was about to be displayed once again!</p><p>“This was Water Ghost’s trump card…”</p><p>Everyone realized why Water Ghost dared to be so arrogant and forcefully overcome the supreme saint calamity that had undergone several mutations. When he had the secondary plane door in his hand, it meant that if he couldn’t withstand the late-stage saint calamity, he could stop it at any time.</p><p>As for Mu Ling…</p><p>Water Ghost did not touch Mu Ling’s own saint calamity. He only targeted the two supreme saint calamity that had locked onto Mu Ling.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The moment the door closed, the saint calamity would be cut off.</p><p>On the other side, Dao Qiongcang was caught off guard. His body turned into a ray of starlight under the saint calamity.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>He flew toward Water Ghost, and the divine Sinan spun at the same time when the secondary plane door was activated.</p><p>“Divine Thirty-Six Form, Great Stripping Technique!”</p><p>With a buzz, the secondary plane door above Mu Ling’s head closed, but the saint calamity was not cut off.</p><p>Because Water Ghost’s secondary plane door suddenly flew away.</p><p>It was just like when he wanted to parasitize Dao Qiongcang but was stripped instead.</p><p>This time, the secondary plane door seemed to have entered an independent Divine World.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang guided it gently.</p><p>The door was enveloped by countless heavenly runes and then disappeared.</p><p>“You!” Suddenly, Water Ghost’s eyes flashed with shock as he abruptly turned around.</p><p>A great commotion arose from the ruins of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>Li Fugui’s reaction was extremely fast. Before everyone could say anything, he loudly made a brilliant statement.</p><p>“As expected of Hallmaster Dao. As long as he seized the secondary plane door, Water Ghost will definitely lose.”</p><p>“Although we have to sacrifice two of the Holy Palace’s descendants, so what? Whenever there’s a sacrifice, there would be a gain!”</p><p>Everyone was shocked, yet they remained skeptical.</p><p>Only a small number of people looked at Li Fugui with hostility.</p><p>They had tolerated this guy for a long time!</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression changed when he saw that Water Ghost’s secondary plane door had been taken away, but he quickly calmed down.</p><p>Would Water Ghost be so careless?</p><p>As expected, when the secondary plane door appeared again, it was in Dao Qiongcang’s palm.</p><p>“Water Ghost…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang smiled and wanted to speak. Water Ghost’s lips curled up in a sneer as he revealed a cunning smile.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, do it!”</p><p>The lightning exploded with a loud bang. The faint light in Water Ghost’s heart lit up again as he shouted and revealed the shadow of another door.</p><p>What Dao Qiongcang had in his hand was only a phantom secondary plane door!</p><p>Fake!</p><p>It was all fake!</p><p>These two old foxes certainly played dirty!</p><p>“Secondary plane door, seal.”</p><p>Water Ghost held the real secondary plane door and activated the Inner Island’s Spell Forbidden Barrier. The Holy Power that flashed across Dao Qiongcang’s body that he had tried to resist was wiped out.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was sealed!</p><p>These twists and turns happened so quickly that Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even have time to react.</p><p>Water Ghost never had the intention to save Mu Ling. He only used this loophole as an opportunity to fool Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>And Dao Qiongcang had fallen for it?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou broke out in a cold sweat. Once again, he wrote down these dirty tricks in his small notebook. He warned himself not to fall for them like those demi-saints, Yan Wuse and Jiang Buyi.</p><p>“Make a move, my ass…”</p><p>“What realm am I at? What cultivation level are you at? Do you think I’m worthy to help you?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
