(2)</h1><p>Chapter 2141: Destiny Is in My Hands, Who Can’t Be Punished? (2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio     Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>She didn’t say much. She was still quite a smart person. She knew that at this time, she couldn’t say anything to provoke him. Otherwise, things might change.</p><p>However, even though she had lost all her trump cards, she was still fearless. It was as if she was sure that since Water Ghost appeared, he would not dare to kill her.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw it all too clearly!</p><p>An evil energy arose in his heart for no reason, just like when he transformed into a Berserk Giant. The beastly desire that constantly attacked his rationality surged forth.</p><p>“The Dao realm doesn’t allow me to slay a Saint?” Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows, and a ray of intense white light shot out from his eyes.</p><p>He could even use his spiritual senses to see that Dao Qiongcang, who had been blasted into the ground, had already given up trying to stop him.</p><p>It was as if he was certain that he wouldn’t dare to confront the aristocratic family of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, stop talking, stop!” Water Ghost knew that this kid understood what he meant, but why did he not show any signs of stopping?</p><p>“An Upanishad demi-saint is afraid of the Holy Emperor’s aristocratic family?” Xu Xiaoshou said in disdain. His fingertips trembled, and the white and green powers overlapped and seemed to fuse into one force.</p><p>From the corner of his eye, he could see the mocking expressions on the faces of the hundreds of Spiritual Cultivators in the ruins of the First Hall of Sins. Hallmaster Dao didn’t come out to stop him, but his own side Water Ghost came out to stop him. This show was too good to miss… The spectators should have such thoughts, right?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, your actions will attract…” Water Ghost’s heart started to palpitate rapidly. The supreme saint calamity didn’t scare him but Xu Xiaoshou did.</p><p>“Bullshit!” However, he was interrupted by Xu Xiaoshou. “At the Acquired</p><p>Stage, I fought with Feng Kong Shao Yi. In the Innate Stage, I killed Zhang</p><p>Taiying. In the Master Stage, I sparred with Jiang Buyi. Why can’t I kill Rao</p><p>Yaoyao when I am at the Sovereign Stage? Just because her surname is Rao?”</p><p>Under the supreme saint calamity, Water Ghost’s scalp went numb when he heard this.</p><p>This kid was used to fighting at the higher realms. Did he really think that he could reverse the odds?</p><p>However, before Water Ghost could say anything, Xu Xiaoshou raised his head and laughed maniacally. He stared at Rao Yaoyao like the God of death.</p><p>“Since the end of the path of cultivation is blocked by the Holy Emperor.” “Then, are you Water Ghost going to cultivate this path or not?”</p><p>With a boom, Water Ghost’s mind went blank, and his pupils trembled.</p><p>The White Demon Heart Tribulation brought by the supreme saint calamity didn’t cause any ripples in his state of mind.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s deafening voice almost caused his foundational roots to collapse, and he almost went berserk under the saint calamity cultivation deviation.</p><p>This kid…</p><p>Water Ghost finally saw something in Xu Xiaoshou that was different from himself..</p><p>He was a genius, the next Upanishad demi-saint.</p><p>However, there were many geniuses in this world. There was only one person who could truly cultivate the Great Path.</p><p>When he counted further back, there was only Bazhun’an in his youth.</p><p>Water Ghost wanted to persuade him again, but he couldn’t say anything.</p><p>This was equivalent to his previous inner demon, so how could he stop it?</p><p>When he saw how Water Ghost’s aura stagnated, Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was filled with pride.</p><p>At this point in the battle, the aura of defeat had reached its peak. With the addition of the momentum of the Swallow the Mountains and Rivers, Xu Xiaoshou was like a Holy Emperor who had descended into the world at this moment, fearless!</p><p>With just a glance, he could suppress the supreme saint calamity from punishing him and make the thousands of people on Abyss Island tremble in fear.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!” A hint of shock finally appeared in Rao Yaoyao’s eyes, as if she had just seen what his intentions were and realized how ruthless Xu Xiaoshou was.</p><p>However, what greeted her was another kick and another huge Taotie Beast</p><p>Head.</p><p>The power of the Holy Emperor’s blood finally dissipated.</p><p>The Golden Fate Dragon dissipated after its hearty meal.</p><p>Ten years in one bite.</p><p>Not only was the fate of the Holy Divine Palace stored in the Cang Godhood Sword about to be eaten up, but the defensive power was practically useless.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had nothing left.</p><p>She also felt that her fate had changed, and there was only darkness in front of her.</p><p>“Cutie Rao!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou roared as he could no longer suppress the power in his fingertips.</p><p>He spread out his spiritual senses. The two figures in the Forest of Miracles wanted to hide, but they could no longer do so under his gaze.</p><p>Mei Siren and Bazhun’an!</p><p>They were all here, watching the battle!</p><p>In the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion, Elder Eighth had said that he should not compare himself to Jiang Buyi, Rao Yaoyao, Water Ghost, Yan Wuse, or even Bazhun’an himself. He should surpass them.</p><p>If that was the case, would Bazhun’an spare Rao Yaoyao because of the Holy Emperor’s aristocratic family if he were in his position?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t look at him. He was afraid that Bazhun’an would stop him like Water Ghost, so he quickly looked away.</p><p>He only handed over his absolute fighting spirit and the judgment between life and death to the last finger.</p><p>The answer was presented perfectly in front of Rao Yaoyao and everyone on Abyss Island.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you dare?”</p><p>“You wouldn’t dare!!!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao could no longer suppress the panic in her heart. Even if she didn’t want to say it, she would still say it out loud and try to take in Xu Xiaoshou’s attack.</p><p>But…</p><p>There are 3,000 people in the world, and they were all equal at their time of birth.</p><p>Destiny is all in my hands. Who can’t be killed?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clenched his left hand in the air, and the Dragon Melting Realm exploded as if he controlled the destiny of the Great Path.</p><p>His right hand that was in the air pointed at the shocked Rao Yaoyao and his expression was cold and ruthless.</p><p>“The destiny is in my hands, why wouldn’t I dare?”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>He calmly pointed.</p><p>The light that shot out from his fingertip was the Holy Emperor’s destructive force, the light of soul destruction.</p><p>It broke through the void and exploded with a loud sound like the cauldron explosion of a Heaven and Earth Oven.</p><p>The supreme saint calamity came to a halt and even the Dragon Melting Realm was shattered.</p><p>The dazzling light was initially just a line, but it instantly turned into a shock wave that swept across half the sky.</p><p>It was like Goose Lake that had locked down Heaven and Earth. It gathered thousands of violent emotions and used the calmest method to reflect Rao Yaoyao’s pale face, the Water Ghost’s shocked eyes, Dao Qiongcang’s bewildered gaze, and the incredulity of the Spiritual Cultivators on Abyss Island.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>After this sound, the world fell silent.</p><p>Outside the Forest of Miracles, Mei Siren was in a vacuum. He couldn’t hear anything else and was so anxious that his face turned red.</p><p>“Bazhun’an! Xu Xiaoshou has gone on a killing spree, but you didn’t stop him… Why have you extended your fist?” As he sent this telepathic communication, he turned his head. He did not expect Bazhun’an to be so calm. He even extended an inexplicable… Fist?</p><p>“He’s looking at me.” Bazhun’an extended his right hand, his four fingers were tightly pressed together and did not even tremble.</p><p>“You can see it?”</p><p>“I can’t see it.”</p><p>“Then you…”</p><p>“This is my attitude.” “What attitude?”</p><p>“Master Siren, can’t you see?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“My thumb is upright.”</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>High in the sky, when the form and spirit extinguishing finger was condensed, it meant that Xu Xiaoshou had no way out.</p><p>He wouldn’t leave Rao Yaoyao with Water Ghost, because this guy would probably only dare to touch the semi-saint person; he would not kill her.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou would make a big deal out of it today.</p><p>So what if the Holy Emperor’s power was gone?</p><p>So what if the charge point of the Disillusionment Finger was reset to zero? If Bazhun’an did not have any intention to start a war with the aristocratic family of the Holy Emperor, would he have declared war with the Holy Divine Palace?</p><p>He was on Abyss Island, and he meant what he said.</p><p>Since that was the case, what was there to be afraid of?</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>After a brief moment of silence, the world was once again filled with rumbling sounds.</p><p>The vacuum tore everything apart, and the atmosphere gathered again.</p><p>When the light from his finger reached Rao Yaoyao’s face, the ancient sword saint who had always had little regard for life and death due to her immense support, finally tasted the fear of mortals.</p><p>“Spare…”</p><p>She opened her mouth, but to her surprise, she couldn’t make any sound. She didn’t know what she was going to say.</p><p>However, a voice still drifted down from the Heavens and Earth. It came from Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>He could choose not to make a move, but he couldn’t just sit back and watch Rao Yaoyao die.</p><p>“Rao! Wang! ze!”</p><p>As soon as his voice echoed all around, the Dragon Melting Realm that covered Abyss Island exploded with a bang. The supreme saint calamity weakened and seemed to tremble.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw the light from his finger pause at the tip of Rao Yaoyao’s nose. He was momentarily in a trance.</p><p>Rao Wangze?</p><p>What was that, someone’s name?</p><p>Just like Xu Xiaoshou, the other Spiritual Cultivators on the island were also confused.</p><p>Suddenly, the sky darkened.</p><p>A great pressure appeared out of thin air, as if an intangible hand of God gathered in the sky and pressed downward and wanted to suppress everyone to the ground.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s knees exploded in a mess of blood and fire, and his waist bent violently and almost broke.</p><p>He opened his mouth and spat out blood. His expression changed drastically.</p><p>Pressure!</p><p>The pressure of a Holy Emperor!</p><p>“Rao Wangze…”</p><p>Cracking sounds could be heard as countless Spiritual Cultivators on Abyss</p><p>Island were forced to their knees, their hearts filled with fear and submission.</p><p>When he uttered this name again, it was as if something had been erased from everyone’s memories.</p><p>It was clearly a name that he had seen and heard somewhere before, but had forgotten.</p><p>“Holy Emperor Wangze! ”</p><p>“Rao Wang… This, this was the Holy Emperor’s real name!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou angered the Rao Clan’s Holy Emperor. This time, it was the real Holy Emperor who attacked. He will die without a burial place!”</p><p>Li Fugui prostrated himself in the pit. He couldn’t even raise his head. His body was a bloody mess from the pressure of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>He moaned silently and laughed bitterly.</p><p>“Lord Shou, you can’t make a move. You can hit, but you really can’t kill….”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
