(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“He won’t hold back!” Dao Qiongcang’s heart trembled.</p><p>Bazhun’an’s talent was already very outstanding.</p><p>And if there was someone more terrifying than the current Bazhun’an, it would be the young Bazhun’an.</p><p>At that time, he was the perfect epitome of a ‘newborn calf that was not afraid of the tiger’. He did not even take the descendant of the one of the five Holy Emperor’s aristocratic family seriously.</p><p>If one came, he would kill one, and if two came, he would kill two.</p><p>Now, Xu Xiaoshou showed the same traits!</p><p>His performance almost surpassed the young and frivolous Bazhun’an!</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou succeeded, he might really kill Rao Yaoyao and even himself… Dao Qiongcang’s brows were tightly furrowed. He had a premonition that something bad was about to happen.</p><p>Under everyone’s gaze, Xu Xiaoshou who stood amid the sea of fire completely activated Ember Heart’s power.</p><p>He finally had a chance to vent his overflowing Holy Emperor power.</p><p>He held up his hands and the entire Abyss Island shook.</p><p>“Dragon! Fusion! Realm!”</p><p>The Saint Language resounded in every word and pause.</p><p>As if it received an Imperial Decree, the flames spread out in all directions and rose up among the thousands of mountains.</p><p>With a loud bang, the supreme saint calamity instantly lost its color.</p><p>Endless white flames rose from the edge of Abyss Island and poured into the Nine Heavens like an inverted waterfall.</p><p>What it came to the Eighth Palace, it was said that Elder Sang’s Dragon Melting Realm was formed from the Hundred Thousand Mountains and this was already amazing.</p><p>Then, Xu Xiaoshou had pushed this power to the extreme. He had suppressed the power of the Holy Emperor for so long just for it to erupt at this moment.</p><p>“Condense!”</p><p>With a shout, the sky exploded, and even the supreme saint calamity almost shattered.</p><p>The white flames formed a barrier with the ground as the base and the sky as the top and enveloped the entire island tightly.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>The Dragon Melting Realm was completely closed off and no one could escape.</p><p>The space was distorted by the high temperature, layer upon layer and those who were in the Dragon Melting Realm sweated profusely and were reduced to ashes.</p><p>The white fire snakes were dyed by the Way of the Heavens. They crisscrossed and formed a three-dimensional network of fire lines that covered the entire Abyss Island.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s eyes were full of fear. This move had the shadow of the Light Energy Realm and traces of the Great Embroidery Technique…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou really showed off what he had just mastered!</p><p>Screams resounded all over the island, but no one dared to move.</p><p>This was because the fire snakes followed the Great Path and passed through their bodies. This was even more terrifying than the condensed and compressed light.</p><p>In the Light Energy Realm, people could still live in peace without making any moves.</p><p>In Xu Xiaoshou’s Dragon Melting Realm, if the person didn’t move, the fire snake ignited itself to ease the pain.</p><p>The same power pierced through his body, but the Dragon Melting Realm added an additional layer to the burning sensation. The pain of the Nine Sereneties in the sea of fire was nothing compared to this!</p><p>Above the Azure Marsh, Rao Yaoyao had entered the Swordless Sword Technique state.</p><p>However, she couldn’t deal with this state of intertwined ‘nothingness’. The white flame ignited the ‘nothingness’ and penetrated her body. It pinned her in place and prevented her from moving.</p><p>In the Sleeping Valley, Dao Qiongcang also gave up all resistance. The fire snakes pierced his body one after another and seared his muscles and spiritual source.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s expression was impassive, despite the pain.</p><p>Under the supreme saint calamity, the thunder calamity descended from the sky. It was like the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation in the First Hall of Sins that was split by the light and scattered into bits of flowing snow.</p><p>However, the fury of the thunder did not fade, and it added a burning sensation.</p><p>Water Ghost’s Water-type Upanishad was ignited by the power of the Holy Emperor!</p><p>Not only did he have to transcend the tribulation, but he also had to endure the power of Xu Xiaoshou’s Holy Emperor attacks that didn’t differentiate between friend and foe.</p><p>His entire person, including his mentality, was burned to the point of irritability!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, stop!” Water Ghost roared at him.</p><p>When he saw that Xu Xiaoshou did not seem to heed him, he raised his voice again. “Xu Xiaoshou, can you listen…”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s entire body tensed up, and his condition was unstable. He roared angrily and interrupted Water Ghost.</p><p>He didn’t dare to turn his head, afraid that he would cause Water Ghost to explode with his extra strength.</p><p>The Holy Emperor’s power was not that easy to endure.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou had no other choice but to vent his anger.</p><p>As for being able to restrain his strength after he vented it so that his own people would have a comfortable environment to transcend the tribulation…</p><p>What a joke!</p><p>If he, Xu Xiaoshou, could perfectly control the power of the Holy Emperor, would he be in so much pain right now; and would he hurt the innocent people below that Dao Qiongcang could not protect?</p><p>Water Ghost suppressed the pain and transcended the tribulation. He could tell that a certain someone was not in a good state, so he did not dare to speak loudly, afraid that it would startle Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Then take it easy.”</p><p>The entire island was in pain.</p><p>It could be said that there were still some people on Abyss Island who could withstand Xu Xiaoshou’s Holy Emperor power and even enjoy it…</p><p>There were!</p><p>There were two of them!</p><p>“It hurts! Supreme Master, it hurts! Haha…” Bai Lian laughed loudly even as he cried out in pain.</p><p>He felt like he had returned to the time when he first entered the Infernal lineage, when he was forcefully fed Fire Seeds by the Greater Goose Lake by Mu Ling.</p><p>Tears flowed from his eyes and he was in extreme pain, but they were also burned away by the high temperature. They were filled with sweet memories.</p><p>With the help of the infernal power, the Nine Death Thunder Calamity was bearable.</p><p>Bai Lian had entered the late-stage of his transcend the tribulation.</p><p>His body was immediately burned by the flames but was restored just as quickly.</p><p>To become a higher void was no longer a problem for him. At this moment, he was both in pain and joy.</p><p>“Don’t talk, just swallow!”</p><p>Mu Ling took mouthfuls after mouthfuls, as he tried to help his Martial</p><p>Nephew to share the pain of the overflowing power of the infernal power.</p><p>His saint calamity was also dyed with the white flames, but it added a sense of intimacy and made it easier to transcend the tribulation.</p><p>“Eat!” Bai Lian opened his mouth and breathed in the flames. His condition improved rapidly.</p><p>“Swallow!” Mu Ling was so happy that he even dared to rush into the burning calamity clouds. He was like a God that descended to the mortal world, the more he crossed, the better he felt.</p><p>It was painful for others to transcend the tribulation.</p><p>The master and disciple transcended the tribulation and it was like the pleasure they had when they bathed in the Desolate Inferno Domain.</p><p>“Delightful!”</p><p>“Ahhh!”</p><p>Different from his junior brother and uncle-master, Xu Xiaoshou roared loudly. He was burnt to the point that he felt a little paranoid..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
