(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>It wasn’t that Rao Yaoyao didn’t have any treasures to protect herself, but she was so confident that no one in the world could hurt her, so she didn’t bring them along.</p><p>It was the same when it came to Elixirs; she was not prepared.</p><p>For defense, I will only use my sword to attack.</p><p>When it came to Elixirs, I only take the ones given by Yu Lingdi?</p><p>“Aren’t you a little too arrogant?” Xu Xiaoshou laughed out loud. He exerted some force in his hand and was about to break Rao Yaoyao’s neck.</p><p>Semi-saint person?</p><p>When one was about to die, it would naturally exist. Before that, It had merely been a test.</p><p>Weng!</p><p>When the Divine Path Principles flashed under Rao Yaoyao’s feet again, Xu Xiaoshou was not surprised and laughed silently.</p><p>“My Bodhisattva, you’re about to turn into mud yourself. How can you still care about others?”</p><p>“Turn into spring mud to protect the flowers?”</p><p>With a flash of fire, Xu Xiaoshou, who was clearly at Rao Yaoyao’s side for her last breath a moment ago, instantly appeared beside Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was in a bad state.</p><p>His protective spiritual weapon had been badly damaged.</p><p>The Recoil force of that punch earlier almost broke all his bones even though it had gone through numerous layers of defenses.</p><p>However, after he regained his senses, he saw that Rao Yaoyao was in danger again. He had no choice but to take action.</p><p>“The principles of the world need to be constantly revised…”</p><p>After being mocked, suddenly such a profound sentence drifted into his ears.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was momentarily stunned, as if he had understood something.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at him with a solemn expression as he continued to speak. However, his knees were still in the air, and he turned aside. His right leg swept up, and suddenly the scene changed.</p><p>“Ada”‘</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s fingertips exploded, together with his rings.</p><p>The five-colored dazzling lights flew out and turned into barriers and halos that protected him.</p><p>However, after he recovered from his shock, he was still dazed from the whip kick. His body was blasted into space again, and he flew from the First Hall of Sins to the Blood World.</p><p>“Don’t be distracted, Bodhisattva. I’m very serious about this fight!”</p><p>After he sent Dao Qiongcang flying with a kick, Xu Xiaoshou returned to Rao Yaoyao at the speed of light. He proceeded to grab her neck and squeezed it hard.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>A drop of golden blood gushed out of Rao Yaoyao’s head.</p><p>As soon as it appeared, Abyss Island began to tremble, and Xu Xiaoshou felt his heart palpitate.</p><p>The power contained in this blood was more than that of a demi-saint, but was on par with the power in his body.</p><p>“Holy Emperor blood?”</p><p>Not only were the spectators from the First Hall of Sins shocked, Xu Xiaoshou was even more shocked.</p><p>As expected!</p><p>There was still a trump card!</p><p>This drop of blood appeared for only a moment before it shattered and transformed into a stream of light that protected Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>Not only did the Holy Emperor blood help Rao Yaoyao to withstand the attack that nearly broke her neck, but it was even more miraculous than the God’s Blessing as it healed her injuries.</p><p>Even her two severed arms healed quickly!</p><p>“How excessive…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed and felt angry. He followed up with a kick and lashed out at Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>His attempt to break her neck had been blocked by the Holy Emperor’s blood, but Rao Yaoyao was sent flying by his grip and temporarily lost control of her body.</p><p>The situation was still under control!</p><p>“Treasures?”</p><p>“Let’s see if it’s because you have more treasures or my Holy Emperor power was insufficient!”</p><p>Punches and kicks rained down.</p><p>One aura ago, Xu Xiaoshou violently beat up Rao Yaoyao. In the next second, Xu Xiaoshou kicked Dao Qiongcang. One person, two rays of light.</p><p>He was going to beat up two people from two different directions!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was able to quickly wear down Rao Yaoyao’s Holy Emperor power and destroy all the supreme treasures on Dao Qiongcang’s body.</p><p>“Oh my God!”</p><p>The spectators below had mixed reactions.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a God who had descended to the mortal world. He fought against two people single-handedly and they were completely suppressed.</p><p>How could such a charming demeanor not cause others to be… horrified?</p><p>“This is too crazy. Sword Saint Rao’s sword was even sent flying due to the attack. Hallmaster Dao couldn’t even protect himself.”</p><p>“Xu Xiao… How many treasures did Xu Holy Emperor lose? It’s such a waste.</p><p>Why don’t you give some to me?”</p><p>“Is this the foundation of one of the five Holy Emperor’s aristocratic family?”</p><p>“With such wealth, how can Xu Xiaoshou reverse the situation even if he had the power?”</p><p>“Yes, although Hallmaster Dao’s delaying tactic was carried out in a different way, it was effective. Xu Xiaoshou could not kill either of them!”</p><p>“Lord Shou…”</p><p>The battle situation was tense.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was furious during this battle.</p><p>Even though he had grounded all of Rao Yaoyao’s Holy Emperor’s blood and shattered all of Dao Qiongcang’s treasures…</p><p>However, the Holy Emperor power in his body was about to run out.</p><p>His aura had weakened…</p><p>His strength gradually decreased…</p><p>“I don’t have enough time.”</p><p>When he realized this, Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to delay any longer.</p><p>He gathered all the power in his energy into one finger and his body quivered.</p><p>“Let it rip!!”</p><p>There was a tearing sound and Xu Xiaoshou split into two as he formed a second true body in full view of everyone.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, whose eyes were bloodshot, pointed a finger at Rao Yaoyao, who was defenseless, and shouted at the same time.</p><p>As soon as his second true body appeared, he knew what his mission was. He sighed softly and without a word, he swung his sword at the main body.</p><p>“Demons Under Eyes!”</p><p>A bang echoed in his mind and Xu Xiaoshou gave up all resistance and fell into a momentary trance.</p><p>His spiritual awakening was triggered, and he woke up.</p><p>At the same time, his special passive skill was activated.</p><p>“Disillusionment Finger (charge point: 86.34%).”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had a ferocious look as he gathered the power of the Holy Emperor at his fingertips for a final strike. At the same time, a dark soul light flashed.</p><p>The power of the body and the soul overlapped!</p><p>“Cutie Rao, do you still have the Holy Emperor’s blood? Can you block my Absolute Attack?!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
