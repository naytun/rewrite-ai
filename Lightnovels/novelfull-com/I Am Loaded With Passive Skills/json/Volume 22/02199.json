(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Abyss Island.</p><p>The few remaining people looked up at Xu Xiaoshou, who had gone in pursuit with a sword in hand through the spatial crack. He had returned calmly through the same spatial crack. They were speechless for a long time.</p><p>At that moment, the giant kingdom under his feet was connected to the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was able to leave, and Xu Xiaoshou could leave too.</p><p>Therefore it was natural that everyone could hear Rao Yaoyao’s cries to Elder Yu for help from the outside world.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s extremely cold indifference was like what the God of death once said, “One thought divine, another thought devoid of wisdom.”</p><p>The mournful cry of the Saint Fall that followed was a positive confirmation of the result of Xu Xiaoshou’s attack.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had been slashed by his Wisdom is Emptiness!</p><p>Saint Fall!</p><p>Everyone was puzzled.</p><p>They had all arrived at the Shengshen Continent, but no one from the Rao Clan, the Holy Emperor’s aristocratic family, came to help Rao Yaoyao?</p><p>What happened to Elder Yu whom Rao Yaoyao had called out to for help? How was it that he couldn’t protect Rao Yaoyao from Xu Xiaoshou who had lost the power of the four Holy Emperors?</p><p>How could Xu Xiaoshou attain Enlightenment in one day and summon the saint calamity and cut it off with the secondary plane door? How could he step into the highest peak of the ancient swordsman and display the second realm of the Wisdom is Emptiness, a technique that only his teacher knew?</p><p>There were too many questions!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was just a famous junior. How could he do all this?</p><p>Before Abyss Island, everyone felt that even to group him together with Yu Lingdi would lower the level of the latter’s title of Spirit Division Chief.</p><p>Now Xu Xiaoshou had pulled out his sword to kill the Saint. No matter what the process was, the result was that he had completed a magnificent feat that transcended the era.</p><p>His achievements, if one thought about it carefully, had completely surpassed Bazhun’an’s Three Breaths for innate stage, three years for Sword Deity!</p><p>“The times are about to change…”</p><p>When they looked at the black figure who stepped over from the sky amid his fading aura and momentum, many people had this thought.</p><p>With Xu Xiaoshou as the leader, another era was about to arrive.</p><p>Last time, it was the Ten High Nobles. This time, it was known as Xu Xiaoshou the Saint. It appeared too quickly and left his peers far behind.</p><p>Water Ghost looked at Xu Xiaoshou who hobbled back as if he saw a sleeping beast being awakened.</p><p>At the last moment, he was actually the one who let Rao Yaoyao go. Let the tiger return to the mountain… This mountain had to be the Yunlun mountain.</p><p>Water Ghost wasn’t sure what Bazhun’an’s thoughts were, but he could guess.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou eventually decided to retreat and not pursue her, Rao Yaoyao would still have died. She would die under the power of his secondary plane door. Afterward, the karma would be borne by him, Water Ghost. This was part of the plan, and the outcome would not have changed.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou chose to chase after her, then he would be able to develop his skills. Water Ghost would also let Xu Xiaoshou out and made him famous in</p><p>Yunlun.</p><p>The path of the ancient swordsman was different from that of the Spiritual Cultivator.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was considered Bazhun’an’s half successor also needed to be nourished by fame.</p><p>This was the reason why the Southern Region’s Half-Moon Residence had already spread the fame of the Saint Servant Lord Shou before and after Xu Xiaoshou landed on the island.</p><p>Water Ghost’s actions were the last resort to add fuel to the fire.</p><p>Of course, whether or not Xu Xiaoshou could bear the karma after the execution depended on his own ability.</p><p>Water Ghost did not care much about this.</p><p>His mission was already over. After he retired, the one who should consider all these was Bazhun’an.</p><p>Not far away, Dao Qiongcang, who also knew that victory had been decided and had stopped fighting, looked at the young figure with a complicated expression.</p><p>He had lost.</p><p>He had lost completely.</p><p>Even his plan to nurture a good chess piece that could be used in the future in such a foreseeable defeat was crushed by Xu Xiaoshou’s force.</p><p>As expected, the biggest variable on Abyss Island was this young man.</p><p>The Transformation that Dao Qiongcang had failed to predict on Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe had caused him to lose everything. He couldn’t even salvage the situation for the rest of his plan.</p><p>“The younger generation is indeed formidable…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang burst out in laughter. His eyes were filled with nostalgia as he recalled his turbulent state of mind when he fought with various prodigies during his youth.</p><p>Soon, he calmed down and his expression did not change much.</p><p>Failure wasn’t scary. What was scary was not being able to accept failure.</p><p>In the eyes of the world, the Holy Divine Palace’s game was completely over, and it suffered a total defeat.</p><p>In Dao Qiongcang’s eyes, this was the worst-case scenario, but he had already predicted it.</p><p>This could be seen from the fact that he didn’t choose to fight on Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe himself, but instead gave Yan Wuse full authority to deal with Abyss Island.</p><p>At that time, if he Dao Qiongcang had appeared, he might even have died in the end, and his main body would have been implicated.</p><p>As for now, would the outcome be one death, two deaths, or all deaths…</p><p>At this point, it didn’t really matter.</p><p>From the beginning to the end, this was not his battlefield, but the enemy’s backyard.</p><p>Then, how to make use of these deaths to bring out the heat was what the real authorities should consider.</p><p>At this moment, Dao Qiongcang’s heart was cold, and so was his blood. He had long gotten used to this side of himself.</p><p>He could even calmly deduce that there would only be two more developments:</p><p>Or perhaps, the people who had been sitting idly on the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe and even the five Holy Emperors’ aristocratic families would be awakened by such shocking information. The Holy Divine Palace’s forces would be able to reunite under his leadership and fight against the Saint Servants.</p><p>Otherwise, Dao Qiongcang would resign, but he wouldn’t die. He would just leave them to deal with the mess. At the same time, he would seek out the attention of the world, and he would be able to continue his research..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
