(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>As the Taicheng imagery collapsed under the onslaught of the wind wall, Xu Xiaoshou’s aura grew stronger.</p><p>At this moment, even the little bit of power that leaked out of his body made Water Ghost feel shocked.</p><p>The power of a Holy Emperor…</p><p>More than one type?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, can you take it?</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Taicheng on the horizon finally collapsed.</p><p>The sky seemed to have been shattered by the loud explosion, and everything turned dark for a moment.</p><p>The wind wall was instantly blown away, and the sword image couldn’t withstand the power of self-destruction and completely collapsed.</p><p>A blood-red figure and a sword that had lost its luster fell from the sky at the same time.</p><p>“Broken scroll.”</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor’s voice was emotionless as he pointed at the Wind Rites Sutra.</p><p>In an instant, the wind wall shattered and turned into two terrifying tornadoes. One swept towards Mei Siren and the other towards the Taicheng Sword.</p><p>This attack was still the ultimate display of the violent power of the wind attribute.</p><p>Mei Siren’s Heavenly Unravel had shattered and he was unconscious.</p><p>If he had been hit, he would probably have been torn into pieces by the tornado given the ancient swordsman’s weak defense.</p><p>“Sigh.” Water Ghost let out a long sigh, and a black dragon scale appeared in his palm.</p><p>He had no intention of saving Mei Siren.</p><p>However, he had to make up for the time that Mei Siren failed to delay.</p><p>At the same time, the second true body under the Vanishing Technique braced himself and flashed out.</p><p>“Who dares to touch my Teacher?”</p><p>The second true body howled in anger as he faced the Holy Emperor’s tornado.</p><p>He stepped on the Space Dao Disc and teleported Mei Siren and the Taicheng Sword away. Coincidentally, he threw them beside Bazhun’an.</p><p>He didn’t dare to teleport Mei Siren to his side.</p><p>Because the Yuan Mansion was not with him so the Vanishing Technique</p><p>couldn’t bring him away.</p><p>Moreover…</p><p>After the second true body removed the Vanishing Technique and entered the arena, he actually knew his fate.</p><p>“A special clone?”</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor’s blurry face turned toward the second true body.</p><p>He obviously noticed that this brave warrior wanted to do a one for one exchange, so with a tap, he activated the Wind Rites Sutra on his fingertip and chose to fulfill his wish. “Wind pressure.”</p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p>The green tornado shattered and turned into layers of wind pressure. As the second true body moved, it pressed down on his head.</p><p>The rules were crushed, and the space collapsed.</p><p>The second true body let out a wail.</p><p>I knew it… He felt indignant, but he still had a sliver of hope for this familiar power of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>Berserk Giant!</p><p>Exploding Posture!</p><p>Acalanätha!</p><p>Feast!</p><p>A large number of passive skills were instantly released. Even the Vanishing Technique was released the moment it was touched by the wind pressure.</p><p>“Whoa.”</p><p>Silently, the second true body disappeared.</p><p>However, the wind pressure had completely destroyed his flesh and blood; it shattered and disappeared.</p><p>The second true body didn’t disappear into world of the Vanishing Technique. It was totally wiped out by the Holy Emperor’s wind pressure.</p><p>Death, plus one.</p><p>Water Ghost touched the Holy Emperor’s dragon scales. He could not help but smirk when he saw this.</p><p>It was too terrifying!</p><p>He knew how strong Xu Xiaoshou’s defense was.</p><p>However, his clone did not have the Holy Emperor’s power for protection, so even his powerful body was instantly crushed by the wind pressure.</p><p>As an Upanishad demi-saint, if he didn’t have the power of the Holy Emperor, would he end up the same way?</p><p>But there was no time to think!</p><p>After the second true body shattered, Wangze Holy Emperor looked at Xu Xiaoshou’s true body in the sky.</p><p>Water Ghost gritted his teeth. Without too much thought, he could only swallow the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>His eyes immediately widened as he let out a dragon roar. A layer of black dragon scales covered his body as he held the Origin Sealing Spear in his left hand and the Sea God’s Trident in his right.</p><p>With a whoosh, Water Ghost took over the position of guardian from Mei Siren.</p><p>Someone had to sacrifice themselves to fight for a glimmer of light in the darkness.</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor’s blurry expression turned murderous.</p><p>These moths flew in, one after another, to seek their deaths. It was most annoying.</p><p>He wanted to kill them all, but he didn’t expect that Mei Siren would be successfully replaced by Xu Xiaoshou’s clone.</p><p>This was not part of the plan.</p><p>However, this Water Ghost was a talented Upanishad demi-saint. If he was eliminated, the other party would feel an array of regret.</p><p>“Your courage is commendable.”</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor looked at his new target and praised him without any emotion.</p><p>Even with the power of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon endorsed by the Holy Emperor, Water Ghost was still nothing to him.</p><p>This was too forceful!</p><p>The Taicheng Sword had some ties with Mei Siren, and its own strength was also strong.</p><p>Water Ghost had only swallowed a single scale from the Holy Emperor. The two powers were incompatible, and it was still considered a forced absorption.</p><p>This wasn’t even close to the Holy Emperor’s thought incarnation, so how could it protect Water Ghost?</p><p>“Die.</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor didn’t even use the Wind Rites Sutra against this Upanishad demi-saint. He just pointed at him.</p><p>The Azure Finger gathered in the wind, and Water Ghost felt that he was being underestimated.</p><p>He was not as good as Mei Siren?</p><p>Why did Wangze Holy Emperor look down on him?</p><p>However, just as his thoughts flashed by, the wind elemental energy that had spread across the Desolate Inferno Domain suddenly gathered again.</p><p>“Wind pressure.”</p><p>When the Azure Finger appeared, the wind pressure gathered speed.</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor was restricted by the rules and couldn’t act recklessly.</p><p>He moved very slowly.</p><p>However, this change in his move caused Water Ghost’s hair to stand on end, and he really thought he would die.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The Holy Emperor’s power that belonged to the Demonic Emperor Black</p><p>Dragon only lasted for an aura before it was shattered by the wind pressure.</p><p>Water Ghost turned pale with fright. The Power Upanishad Formation under his feet spun, and he chose to run and did not look back.</p><p>He couldn’t risk it!</p><p>He wasn’t Mei Siren, nor was he Bazhun’an’s subordinate. They were just partners..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
