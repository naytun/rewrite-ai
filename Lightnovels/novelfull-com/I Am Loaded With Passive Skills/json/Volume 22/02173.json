(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio     Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Before long, the Vermilion Bird gate opened.</p><p>A huge and vague power was injected into the Blood World Pearl and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man immediately stopped jerking about in pain.</p><p>His head drooped and he resembled a zombie.</p><p>However, in an instant, he raised his head again. The faceless orange mask was invaded by the surging blood.</p><p>“I, shall return.”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man spoke in a voice that did not belong to him, but neither did it belong to Ye Xiao, or anything else that he had swallowed. Instead, it was an extremely ancient voice filled with vicissitudes, and uttered in a deep self-murmur.</p><p>When the Saint Language sounded, the aura of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man rose from that of a demi-saint to a Holy Emperor.</p><p>The sky turned red.</p><p>The scene beside the Vermilion Bird Gate was similar to the nine extreme grounds in the Blood World. Mountains of corpses appeared in the Blood Sea.</p><p>The ultimate eye catching image was the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, who was drenched in blood.</p><p>Behind him, there were seven towering blood trees. They were ugly, skinny, and withered and corpses dangled from their branches.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I can’t take it… anymore…”</p><p>In the sky above the Desolate Inferno Domain, after Mu Zixi exited the Yuan Mansion, the energy that radiated from her body grew increasingly violent.</p><p>Finally, she couldn’t hold on any longer. Her eyes rolled back, and her body floated and flipped over. It was as if she had fallen into a puddle of power and fainted.</p><p>However, when she spun through the air like a fish, an aura of vitality breath spread out.</p><p>Mu Zixi’s black hair turned silver, and her figure became slim and slender. When she opened her eyes again, one was black and the other was white, and once again, they had an extremely cold look in them.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>A soft shout sounded.</p><p>Streams of black and white mist flowed out of her pupils.</p><p>The God Devil Eyes rotated and fused with the power of the ancestral source. It forcefully suppressed the rampaging Holy Emperor power in her body.</p><p>Although she couldn’t do it, she could temporarily suppress the loss of control.</p><p>Lei Xi’er endured the pain that Mu Zixi couldn’t bear and she completely ignored it and did not even frown.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what happened?” Lei Xi’er suppressed the pain in her body, tilted her head and looked at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>She desperately needed an explanation. Her body had actually become a passageway that was connected to the power of Holy Emperor.</p><p>When did he plant this seed?</p><p>However, when she turned around, Lei Xi’er saw that Xu Xiaoshou twitched all over like a balloon that was about to burst.</p><p>The pain he suffered at the moment was far greater than her own. He simply could not find the time to explain.</p><p>“God Devil Eyes?!”</p><p>There was no doubt that Mu Zixi’s transformation shocked everyone. Even Wangze Holy Emperor turned to look at her.</p><p>This wasn’t just because of the unique and gorgeous transformation of her Ultimate Life Demon Physique, but also because she had perfectly inherited the power of the God Devil Eyes.</p><p>At such a young age, she had already mastered two types of power of the ancestral source.</p><p>“Orphan from the Lei family?”</p><p>Only the descendants of the Lei family could inherit the power of the God Devil Eyes.</p><p>The silver-haired girl’s eyes were the greatest flaw in the Dao Clan’s plan to exterminate the Lei Clan.</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor was moved.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang, who observed everything from the ruins of the First Hall of Sins also had a strange expression.</p><p>What he saw was that Xu Xiaoshou had become the array eye, opened a passage, and received the power.</p><p>The process was so short that it could be ignored.</p><p>However, Dao Qiongcang had never thought that the Yuan Mansion would open up a spatial passageway and a descendant of the Lei Clan, who underwent such a majestic transformation, would make her appearance.</p><p>What he didn’t expect was that Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even need the sword left behind by Bazhun’an to connect to the Inner Island and receive the power of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>Then the Sword Will that he and Wangze Holy Emperor had confidently wiped off at the Fallen Abyss would become a joke!</p><p>The real key was the Yuan Mansion and this silver-haired girl!</p><p>“The aura of the White Cave Small World…</p><p>“She swallowed the Source of the World. She is the true owner of the White</p><p>Cave.”</p><p>“As for drawing in the power of the Holy Emperor, Bazhun’an knew that they couldn’t do it from Abyss Island or the Si Wu Formation.”</p><p>“So, all the arrangements were hidden on this seemingly insignificant little girl from the beginning to the end?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang seemed to understand.</p><p>With just a glance, he connected everything.</p><p>The power of the Inner Island’s Holy Emperor would definitely not come when they broke the seal on Abyss Island. Instead, it would come from the master of the White Cave, the authority of the silver-haired girl.</p><p>NO!</p><p>There should also be a change in the Shengshen Continent now. The seal of the Infernal Hell Sea, one of the Seven Breaks, should have been broken.</p><p>They would come out of the Infernal Hell Sea, break through the spacetime, and rush to the Yunlun Mountain Range’s Lone Cliff as fast as they could to help Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“As expected of you…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked at the figure outside the Forest of Miracles. His eyes flickered as he clicked his tongue and sighed.</p><p>This move had been kept hidden for too long!</p><p>It was so far off that it was before Dao Qiongcang took office… Perhaps, before Bazhun’an was born, the Inner Island’s ghost beasts had already planned this.</p><p>What Bazhun’an did was to follow the trend. If there were too many threads, they would be used.</p><p>However, there was no doubt that he had succeeded.</p><p>He had deceived everyone. Even Dao Qiongcang and Wangze Holy Emperor had been led in the wrong direction.</p><p>And one wrong step meant more mistakes.</p><p>It was impossible to stop the Holy Emperor from borrowing the power of the Inner Island. Did this mean that Wangze Holy Emperor would single-handedly fight with four people?</p><p>“As expected, even the Holy Emperor can’t turn the tables in a losing situation.”</p><p>“The Ming Yi is still accurate. Fortunately, I didn’t interfere. Bazhun’an should at least give me a way out, right?”</p><p>“Elder Yu has not made a move yet. With his speed, he should have arrived long ago…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s thoughts spun quickly. He had his delusions and also his secret preparations.</p><p>When others were shocked by the appearance of the Lei family’s orphan, he was unmoved and had already begun to think of a way to protect himself.</p><p>He used his saint’s will to check the four gates of Abyss Island, only to find that all four gates were closed and his power couldn’t seep out..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
