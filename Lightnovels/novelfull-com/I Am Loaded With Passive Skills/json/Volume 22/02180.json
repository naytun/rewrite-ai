The power of the Great Infernal Ancestor was inherited by Xu Xiaoshou, so he could withstand it.</p><p>But Seven Trees Emperor cultivated the strongest power of guidance, enough to even affect him, Rao Wangze.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, on the other hand, could not withstand the power of Seven Trees Emperor!</p><p>He was completely and utterly manipulated into a brute who only knew how to fight with his body by the power of the Holy Emperor!</p><p>However, in the face of this mockery, Xu Xiaoshou, whose face had been sliced into nothing but a bloody skull, suddenly twitched his jaw, revealing a sinister smile.</p><p>He still had consciousness!</p><p>He was still in control!</p><p>Since awakening the Berserk Giant, he no longer let “animal desires” cloud his mind!</p><p>“Are you kidding, Rao Wangze?”</p><p>“With one against four, how dare you underestimate me? Who gave you the courage… Rao Yaoyao?”</p><p>“You’re absolutely adorable!”</p><p>A thunderous sound.</p><p>Like lightning striking, golden rays of brilliance burst into the air.</p><p>The wind blades were actually shattered, and the slender bone fist in front of Wangze Holy Emperor transformed into a golden fist that descended like Mount Tai.</p><p>Berserk Giant!</p><p>This transformation shook not only the entire Hurricane Belt but also the hearts of countless spectators, the unforgettable memories of Dao Qiongcang, and the terrified pupils of Wangze Holy Emperor.</p><p>Replacing the frail bone, the golden fist struck.</p><p>However, what blasted away the Holy Emperor’s wind blades in the Hurricane Belt was not the core power of the Berserk Giant but the swirling cascade of burning and shattered Path Principles that unfolded with a punch.</p><p>These exposed Order of the Great Path, like the interwoven threads in the giant’s sleeve, were now magnified.</p><p>Under the power of Penetrating Divine Senses, the threads of Path Principles gradually detached from this world, leaving a pure act of violence.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The Berserk Giant’s back cracked open, and at this moment, two blood trees had grown from the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch, with dense canopy rustling and dancing in the wind.</p><p>This punch, empowered by the Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand, unleashed the most extreme output of the bounded domain.</p><p>The Sovereign Domain itself was not frightening.</p><p>What was terrifying was that it was not just a bounded domain; it was a medium that could perfectly detonate the power of the four Holy Emperors, possessing various demi-saint level forces!</p><p>The might of this punch fully released all the forces within Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>As a Holy Emperor, Wangze Holy Emperor reacted with incredible speed.</p><p>But when he sensed something was wrong, it was already too late. He could not retreat anymore; he had to confront it head-on.</p><p>It would not be too late to mend the pen even after the sheep were lost, would</p><p>“Messenger of the Wind God!”</p><p>The Wind Rites Sutra instantly exploded, transforming into a pure and viscous green power of the wind-type Holy Emperor, coursing through Wangze Holy Emperor’s body.</p><p>Under the punch, Wangze Holy Emperor’s body swayed, unexpectedly summoning a Wind God image comparable to the Berserk Giant.</p><p>This Wind God’s image bowed its head, protecting its elbows. It had a green silk robe draped over it, like a blend of Buddha and demon, appearing divine and ghostly.</p><p>From a state of nothingness to the manifestation of the Wind God, it happened in the blink of an eye.</p><p>This spiritual technique also represented Rao Wangze’s strongest defense in the face of a sudden attack.</p><p>However, as the Berserk Giant retracted for a punch, Wangze Holy Emperor still felt something was not right…</p><p>NO!</p><p>It was very wrong!</p><p>At that moment, he felt his left eyeball pop into the right eye socket, his nose breaking into his throat, and the upper and lower rows of left teeth knocking off the right half, causing him to spew blood and fragments of displaced internal organs.</p><p>“The blow was aimed at you, the false deity named Rao!”</p><p>With a resounding crash, under the horrified gaze of the onlookers, the head of Wind God’s image spun seven hundred and twenty degrees in place.</p><p>Frozen in the spirit mirror’s frame was the image of the Wind God, its features contorted, devoid of the solemnity of a Holy Emperor.</p><p>Completely and utterly shattered!</p><p>It not only destroyed the spiritual technique of Wangze Holy Emperor but also the dignity of a Holy Emperor!</p><p>The neck of the Wind God turned into a gust of wind, dissipating on the spot.</p><p>Within the protective array, Wangze Holy Emperor suffered along with the image, his head flying off as his body tumbled backward.</p><p>“Did Xu Xiaoshou just send Wangze Holy Emperor flying?” Numerous people were left speechless.</p><p>This punch told everyone that in the clash of Holy Emperors, victory could be seized in the blink of an eye.</p><p>It was too late to mend the sheep pen after the sheep were lost!</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who landed the punch, did not hesitate for a moment, crushing the bounded domain in his palm.</p><p>With a thunderous sound, the Hurricane Belt was shattered by the power of Four Holy Emperors, turning another extreme ground into nothingness.</p><p>Even Wangze Holy Emperor, who managed to preserve his physical body under that punch, was obliterated.</p><p>He could not sustain it, releasing a trace of mental strength as he escaped.</p><p>The form of the thought incarnation of the Holy Emperor, which could not even be maintained, gave off the scent of a “hapless hound” to the onlookers.</p><p>“Who let you go?”</p><p>The Berserk Giant disappeared, but Xu Xiaoshou’s menacing voice followed, appearing before the remnants of the Holy Emperor’s will.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened his eyes in mid-air, and Demons Under Eyes unfolded beneath his gaze.</p><p>At that moment, the remnants of Wangze Holy Emperor’s will saw not the shadows of the black sky, silver moon, and lonely tower.</p><p>Instead, he saw a raging Berserk Giant, stepping on the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, surrounded by seven blood trees, wrapped in a white sea of flames, with a cyan purgatory above its head and two charred arms!</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor was dumbfounded.</p><p>He was completely suppressed by such sinister and evil imagery.</p><p>Heart Sword Technique, Heavenly Unravel?</p><p>Who exactly was Xu Xiaoshou, and how could he break through at such a critical moment?</p><p>Returning from the overwhelming imagery, Rao Wangze’s thoughts had become concrete—he was in the Falling Flower World, where he faced a solid black sword.</p><p>A vicious sword, the Fourth Sword!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou spat to the side in disdain, reversed the sword, and thrust it mercilessly into the heart of this thought incarnation.</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>The Holy Emperor’s will of Rao Wangze was instantaneously invaded by a</p><p>devilish aura.</p><p>At the last moment, what he heard was a mockery that would be etched in his memory for a lifetime. The speech was extremely slow, the tone indifferent, yet each word cut deep:</p><p>“Insignificant vermin, living a worthless life.”</p><p>“A hapless hound, what right do you have to beg for mercy?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
