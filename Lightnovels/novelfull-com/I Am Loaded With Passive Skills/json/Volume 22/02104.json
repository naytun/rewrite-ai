(1)</p><p>Boom!</p><p>As the Sea God’s Trident shimmered with brilliance, a sense of dread washed over the crowd, reliving the fear they had felt beneath the Lone Cliff, where the deep sea had ruled.</p><p>The waters surged from the sky, cascading like waterfalls, engulfing all directions.</p><p>The sea rolled in from every side, flooding the Sleeping Valley, submerging the Azure Marsh, and pouring into the Blood World, threatening to extinguish the raging fires of the Desolate Inferno Domain.</p><p>In a mere blink, before anyone could react, not just the nine extreme grounds on Abyss Island, but all the Land Realms were enveloped by the deep sea.</p><p>Above the ruins of the First Hall of Sins, shattered stones and debris were tossed about by the colossal waves, and people struggled to stay afloat amidst the churning waters.</p><p>“Gurgle, gurgle…”</p><p>Water balls materialized out of thin air, imprisoning hundreds and thousands of Spiritual Cultivators, choking out pained, drowning cries.</p><p>“The deep sea!”</p><p>“This is the deep sea beneath the Lone Cliff!”</p><p>“The Spell Forbidden Barrier! My spiritual source is immobilized again. Damn it, am I going to be drained once more?”</p><p>“To hell with Water Ghost. I curse you gurgle, gurgle…”</p><p>The curses were relentless.</p><p>For many Spiritual Cultivators who had sneaked into Abyss Island after it settled in the Yunlun Mountain Range, they had not crossed the deep sea beneath the Lone Cliff. Nonetheless, they had heard the stories of the Cutting Path Stage and the Higher Void that were sacrificed during the previous opening of Abyss Island.</p><p>Now, those stories were becoming their reality, and it felt like a disaster.</p><p>For those who had experienced something similar before, there was a sense of despair, while those who were encountering the deep sea for the first time were overwhelmed by panic.</p><p>“What’s happening?”</p><p>“How could the rules of the Inner Island be summoned here?”</p><p>Above the Fallen Abyss, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon reacted swiftly. Sensing that something was amiss, it had already taken Xu Xiaoshou and flown higher into the sky.</p><p>However, no matter how high the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon flew, it was as though a water spirit had grabbed its feet and pulled it into the drowning depths.</p><p>“It’s really the Spell Forbidden Barrier!”</p><p>A massive water bubble enveloped the dragon’s body, neutralizing its holy power and steadily draining it. As the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon realized it could no longer use its powers, it was slightly startled by the unexpected situation.</p><p>It had not been able to understand the complex plan of the Water Ghost before, and even now, it could not fathom it.</p><p>However, the current display of power by the water ghost, a higher void human, left a lasting impression.</p><p>Could a regular person at the higher void level possess such an impressive ability to communicate with the Inner Island?</p><p>His name should have been Bazhun’an. How could an insignificant figure like “Water Ghost” achieve such an incredible feat?</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou found himself trapped inside a water ball once again. His spiritual source was rendered impotent, steadily depleting.</p><p>He sighed deeply, but a mouthful of water silenced him.</p><p>“The Sea God’s Trident!”</p><p>“This is the true power of the Sea God’s Trident!”</p><p>It did not require any water-type Upanishad Formation or an early forecast of a storm.</p><p>With just a thought and the power of the person wielding the trident, the Water Ghost summoned this vast sea.</p><p>Most importantly, it was what the Water Ghost had said earlier…</p><p>“He could always perfectly control the secondary plane door without actually stepping into the Demi-Saint State?”</p><p>“Yes, if he couldn’t, why would there be a Spell Forbidden Barrier beneath the Lone Cliff?”</p><p>“Master Dean once said that, as far as he knows, there are only three Spell Forbidden Barriers in the world: the Inner Island, the Dead Sea, and Shengxuan Gate.”</p><p>“So, Water Ghost’s earlier pretense of ‘having to exert all his strength to activate the secondary plane door’ was just a setup for this moment, to trap Dao Qiongcang here in Abyss Island?”</p><p>A sense of shock overcame Xu Xiaoshou as all these details intertwined.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou truly saw how “dirty” the Water Ghost’s vengeful heart was.</p><p>“The giant statue in Zhen Huang Palace once mentioned that the secondary plane door was lost a day before I arrived… I could obtain this information, and so could the people of the Holy Divine Palace… But for this information to be true, there wouldn’t be a Spell Forbidden Barrier beneath the Lone Cliff… This is one of the reasons!”</p><p>“Secondly, only a demi-saint can activate the secondary plane door, yet Water-type Upanishad can break free from this restraint… The origin of this information is unclear, but the secondary plane door has always been in the hands of ‘Yu Lingdi,’ who is none other than the Water Ghost… Even if the secondary plane door changes ownership, no one else on Abyss Island possesses the power of the Upanishad. How can anyone confirm it… In other words, it all boils down to a word from the Water Ghost.”</p><p>“Lastly, since the Water Ghost obtained the secondary plane door before Abyss Island’s arrival, why would he dare to explain so much in front of Dao Qiongcang? It suggests that most of what he said was a ruse.”</p><p>“All of this indicates that the collaboration between Bazhun’an and the Water Ghost serves a greater purpose than just breaking the seal on the Inner Island of Abyss Island, cutting off the two great arms of Council of Ten, and obtaining more demi-saint person for Saint Servants. Do they also plan to use this small piece of information to trap Dao Qiongcang, ideally burying him entirely within Abyss Island?”</p><p>In a flash, these thoughts raced through Xu Xiaoshou’s mind, leaving him shocked enough to choke on another mouthful of cold water.</p><p>The Water Ghost was not joking. His ambitions were so grand that he genuinely considered eradicating Dao Qiongcang right there to eliminate any future threats.</p><p>Looking around, Abyss Island was completely submerged in the deep sea. Only the master of the deep sea, the Water Ghost, rose above the water, holding the divine trident and a golden beast mask.</p><p>Of all those affected by the draining power of the water balls, Dao Qiongcang was the most deeply affected.</p><p>Even without using his “Perception”, Xu Xiaoshou could see that Dao Qiongcang was sealed by the Spell Forbidden Barrier, powerless to resist the rapid loss of his power.</p><p>In just a few breaths, even though the Cutting Path individuals submerged beneath the deep sea had not been fully drained, Dao Qiongcang’s face had turned deathly pale.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
