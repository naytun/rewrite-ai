(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“This is the Heavenly Unravel?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s original body had been swept into the Si Wu Formation and could not come out to watch.</p><p>After his second true body disappeared, he stepped on the Way of the Sword Disc and silently absorbed everything.</p><p>He had heard of the famed sword Heavenly Unravel for too long, since its creation.</p><p>Today was the first time he had seen it.</p><p>There was no doubt that Master Siren’s sword attack just now, if it had not been the Holy Emperor, would have been like a God that blocked the God of</p><p>Killing, Buddha that blocked Buddha.</p><p>Jiang Buyi and the rest of them could not block it at all.</p><p>If he wanted to survive that sword, he would have to be the liberated state</p><p>Divine Oracle or Yan Wuse in his Ruler Form.</p><p>But even if he could survive, he would be severely injured.</p><p>Master Siren, on the other hand, still had the energy to launch a second attack.</p><p>However…</p><p>“This Heavenly Unravel, is that all?”</p><p>After it entered the Unity of Man and the Heavens state, the second true body keenly sensed that Master Siren’s state was a little off. It seemed to be very forced.</p><p>After the Taicheng Heavenly Unravel, he attacked with brute force.</p><p>If Master Siren had the sense to use the sword image to execute the Ancient</p><p>Sword Technique in such a state, even the thought incarnation of the Holy</p><p>Emperor would have to dodge its sharp edges.</p><p>Unfortunately, there were no ifs…</p><p>“The Taicheng Sword is not Master Siren’s real saber, so his Heavenly Unravel was too forceful?” The second true body saw through it.</p><p>He couldn’t help but look at the main body.</p><p>As his second true body that was connected mentally, he could sense the extraordinary transformation in his original body that had merged into the array eye of the Si Wu Formation.</p><p>It was a power that could not be described with words. It was a mixture of extremely complex auras.</p><p>If he could make it in time, he could become the savior of the world.</p><p>But if he couldn’t make it in time…</p><p>“Don’t, Boss. You can’t drop the ball now!” The second true body sent continuous information about the battlefield to the main body. This was an undisguised urge.</p><p>The battle was still ongoing above the Desolate Inferno Domain.</p><p>Just as what the second true body thought, the Taicheng Heavenly Unravel had merged with Mei Siren’s power, but the ancient sword image had lost its reasoning.</p><p>It would not display any more sword techniques. It was only because of the power of the imagery of the Taicheng that it held onto the only will before the Heavenly Unravel:</p><p>Attack!</p><p>Reckless attack!</p><p>It was fine to perish together, but they could only attack and could not stop!</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor naturally saw Mei Siren’s abnormality.</p><p>After he condensed his physical body, he seemed to have withstood more of the rejection of the rules on Abyss Island. It was obvious that he was out of place here.</p><p>However, these ‘untruths’ were all suppressed by the power of the Holy Emperor, and could not cause any disturbance.</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor flipped his left hand and pointed at the sky with his right hand.</p><p>“Wind Rites Sutra.”</p><p>He only spoke softly. A crack appeared in the sky, and a green colored shadow flew out.</p><p>The green shadow turned into an illusory ancient book.</p><p>This ancient book was not an item or a spiritual weapon. It gathered together all of the Holy Emperor’s power. It exuded an aura that was ancient, gentle, violent, and peaceful .</p><p>“The condensed body of the Holy Emperor’s wind force…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s brows twitched. He recognized that this was the projection of Wangze Holy Emperor’s power.</p><p>Just like his thought incarnation, the Wind Rites Sutra couldn’t come to Abyss Island on its own.</p><p>However, Wangze Holy Emperor was confident that he could deal with the famed sword Heavenly Unravel just by borrowing a wisp of his power?</p><p>Silently, Wangze Holy Emperor held the Wind Rites Sutra in his left hand and flipped it with his right hand.</p><p>The green book opened, and the violent aura on it suddenly became stronger.</p><p>At this moment, strong winds howled and swept across Abyss Island. Ancient trees toppled and mountain rocks cracked.</p><p>Even the innocent spectators who were scattered all over the place felt the force of the green wind as it swept across their bodies.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>The spiritual energy barrier was instantly torn apart.</p><p>Those who were caught off guard were smashed into pieces by the astral winds instantly.</p><p>When the green wind swept across the entire island and gathered in front of Wangze Holy Emperor, it turned into a wind wall that towered up to the sky.</p><p>The wind wall rose from the void and spanned tens of thousands of miles and pierced through the sky.</p><p>It was like a barrier that isolated the imagery of the Taicheng from Wangze Holy Emperor and made it impossible to break through.</p><p>“Righteous Disintegration.”</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor tapped his fingertip lightly.</p><p>The green wind wall intensified and began to tear about violently.</p><p>“Boom boom boom…”</p><p>The Taicheng’s imagery was originally indestructible, but under the onslaught of the endless astral winds, not only was it unable to advance an inch, but its own imagery was also being obliterated bit by bit.</p><p>Very slowly.</p><p>The process of obliteration was so slow that it could be overlooked.</p><p>Because the imagery of the Taicheng was too huge, even bigger than the green wind wall.</p><p>However, everyone could see that Mei Siren and the Taicheng Heavenly Unravel were irrational.</p><p>Once the imagery of the Taicheng started to be obliterated and showed signs of collapse, it would affect the foundation of its internal power.</p><p>Then the one who had a high chance to destroy the imagery of the Taicheng would not be the wind wall’s strength, but Mei Siren himself. This was because his condition was extremely unstable.</p><p>“Too forced! ”</p><p>Water Ghost, who watched from behind, could not help but shake his head.</p><p>In just a short while, the speed at which the Taicheng was being destroyed increased exponentially from the initial imperceptible speed.</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor didn’t even need to do much.</p><p>His eyes were too sharp. With a light attack, he hit his opponent’s sore spot.</p><p>Mei Siren would then lose control.</p><p>The Taicheng Heavenly Unravel would probably fall apart soon.</p><p>“He’s nowhere as good as Bazhun’an. Mei Siren is not good at battles. It’s still too much for him to fight against Holy Emperors.” Water Ghost pondered and glanced at Xu Xiaoshou who was high in the sky. It was undeniable that the delaying tactic had succeeded.</p><p>One Aura, Ten Auras, Thirty Auras….</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
