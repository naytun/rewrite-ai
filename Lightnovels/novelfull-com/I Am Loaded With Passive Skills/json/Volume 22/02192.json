(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“So familiar! That voice is so familiar…</p><p>Everyone who had witnessed the night battle in the imperial city felt that this voice sounded very familiar.</p><p>All of a sudden, a very unorthodox figure appeared in their minds.</p><p>However, how could that absurd figure be compared to the cold, godly voice that resounded from the sky?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?” “Shut up! This is blasphemy! Although I think so too…”</p><p>“It’s him, right?” “Definitely not!”</p><p>“Big Brother Shou…”</p><p>On Pixiu Mountain, the crowd was furious, but they were suppressed by Su Qianqian’s absent-minded murmur.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Was it really him?</p><p>At this moment, those who were aware of the relationship between the new successor of the Burial Sword Tomb and the Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou, were dumbfounded.</p><p>“What? Xu Xiaoshou?” Xu Xiaoji looked at the sword diagram that appeared and was stunned.</p><p>Beside him, Mu Xiaogong, who was dressed in a red dress, covered her mouth and chuckled. However, she could not hide the surprise in her eyes. “Young sir, it seems like it’s really him…”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>When the half-formed Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation emerged from the space, all the onlookers felt their spirits shake as if they had fallen into an abyss.</p><p>They had entered a blurry spirit kingdom. It had nothing, and everything was still in a state of chaos.</p><p>“Elder Yu! Elder Yu!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was in a state of utter panic.</p><p>She could feel that she had been locked onto. If she still had her sword and her physical body, she could use the Mountains and Seas Converge to resist this wave of attack.</p><p>However, her soul had long since been shattered by the Disillusionment Finger and her body had been destroyed by the power of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>A wisp of remnant will could only await death; there was nothing she could do!</p><p>In the black spatial crack, a dark and arrogant illusory figure wrapped in devilish energy, finally emerged from the Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation.</p><p>He lowered his head and squinted slightly. He held Hidden Bitter upside down. His fingertips brushed across the sword body, and the sword body quivered all over. Plum blossoms flew out from it and then disappeared.</p><p>The Sword Will slowly inched its way up!</p><p>It was higher than humans, higher than Yunlun, higher than the Heavens!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen raised her eyes and looked over. Her starry eyes trembled together with her heart.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>But before she could say anything, she felt herself falling into that spiritual kingdom in the next second. A gentle and ethereal Saint Language sounded in her ears.</p><p>“Nine Swords of Chaos, Supreme Heart Technique…”</p><p>“In the realm of imagination, every illusion bows as a humble servant…” “Sinking in body and mind, burdened by scattered thoughts with no respite…” At this point, the Saint Language boomed over.</p><p>The first person to break free from the shackles in the void was Elder Yu!</p><p>He was shocked as if he had seen a ghost. He did not believe that such a young man could slash out such a silent sword.</p><p>Fortunately, his target was Rao Yaoyao, so he was only affected by the aftershock and was able to break free in an instant.</p><p>If he had been the target, he would probably be caught off guard and would not be able to resist in time!</p><p>“Junior, how dare you?”</p><p>Elder Yu waved his hand. His first action wasn’t to help Rao Yaoyao escape, but to rescue his precious great-granddaughter from the abyss of misery.</p><p>Then, he transformed into Kun Peng and flapped his wings as he dashed towards the black shadow.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had entered a state of mental numbness. His qi had reached its peak. How could he be afraid of this Kun Peng? His sword was still, but his eyes snapped to attention.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Elder Yu felt a heavy blow to his spirit. The person he saw was no longer a young man.</p><p>Instead, it was a Berserk Giant with two black hands, a Demonic Emperor Black Dragon at his feet, seven blood trees on his back, a white sea of fire around his body, and a green prison above his head! “What kind of existence was this?”</p><p>Elder Yu was momentarily dazed.</p><p>However, such an imagery was flashy and unrealistic. Xu Xiaoshou no longer had the power of the Holy Emperor in his body, so he could not suppress him at all.</p><p>Elder Yu sneered and moved forward.</p><p>At this moment, he saw Xu Xiaoshou open an ancient book and rustled through its pages.</p><p>Images gathered on the ancient book and soon turned into a white-robed swordsman who stood proudly above it. He held Fourth Sword and shouted. “I am Bazhun’an. Those who wish to test my sword will die!”</p><p>With just one sentence, Xu Xiaoshou’s empty Heart Sword Technique imagery, Heavenly Unravel was instantly filled with endless power. It was as if the Holy Emperor was there in person.</p><p>With a boom, Elder Yu’s incarnation of Kun Peng fluttered in the air and almost fell.</p><p>It was this sudden pause that rendered it too late when he came back to his senses.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s Dao heart was strong, and she also recovered from this mild sword strike. However, suddenly her shrill voice resounded throughout the Yunlun Mountain Range.</p><p>At the same time, Xu Xiaoshou finished reciting the last sentence, and Hidden Bitter turned into a beam of light.</p><p>“One divine thought, another thought devoid of wisdom…”</p><p>This sword flew over and slashed across the sky!</p><p>Today, he, Xu Xiaoshou had pursued her all the way to this place. He would kill anyone who stood in his way!</p><p>“Whoa.”</p><p>The silence rippled out.</p><p>The Falling Flower World was still there, but an intangible bit of remnant thought followed the Saint Language with a little regret and disappeared. It left only a translucent semi-saint person. There were no more energy fluctuations.</p><p>There was no dazzling death.</p><p>At this moment, everyone in the Yunlun Mountain Range experienced the same sorrow.</p><p>With a buzz, after Hidden Bitter hit its peak, it released a sword light and used the name of the Saint to complete its advancement. It had been promoted to a grade four spiritual sword, and its future was already within sight.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou retracted his sword and raised his head. He took a deep breath and sighed.</p><p>“Cutie Rao, have a good trip. I won’t send you off..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
