(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“This lunatic!”</p><p>Water Ghost’s ravings shocked everyone on Abyss Island. Even the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon looked at him in a new light.</p><p>On the dragon’s head, Xu Xiaoshou’s impression of this person changed completely.</p><p>It was not an exaggeration to describe this as ‘doing whatever it took!’</p><p>Water Ghost was really a double-edged sword. How could Bazhun’an dare to use this person?</p><p>Oh, he was Bazhun’an…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rolled his eyes and was speechless.</p><p>Now, even if Water Ghost suddenly attacked him, Xu Xiaoshou felt that it was understandable.</p><p>What was he when Water Ghost only wanted to achieve his goal?</p><p>However, he couldn’t turn a blind eye to the miserable state of his Uncle-Master Mu Ling under the triple saint calamity.</p><p>The lock-on of the supreme thunder calamity, the lock-on of Bai Lian, and Mu Ling’s own saint calamity…</p><p>When these three terrifying attacks were combined, the world would even change, let alone Mu Lin.</p><p>Even Water Ghost might not be able to withstand the intensity of the saint calamity, but Mu Ling did not even have the power of the Upanishad.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was eager to make a move.</p><p>He knew that he was not the one who could save them, that would be either Dao Qiongcang or Water Ghost.</p><p>If one of them helped, and the other didn’t interfere, the result would be good.</p><p>If the two of them attacked together, they would rather die than live in shame. Moreover, this had nothing to do with them.</p><p>But…</p><p>“Why would Water Ghost listen to me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that even if he took out The Four Pillars of Destiny Token, he might not be able to stop the completely bewitched Water Ghost.</p><p>In this situation, Bazhun’an would have to come personally to save Mu Ling and Bai Lian’s lives, right?</p><p>However, if Bazhun’an really came, would he make a move?</p><p>Water Ghost could be a double-edged sword, but at least he had a useful side.</p><p>Bazhun’an was so arrogant that even if he were to come personally, Mu Ling and Bai Lian, who had no connection with him at all, would only be like air in his eyes, and their lives and deaths would not mean anything, right?</p><p>There was only one way to attract that guy’s attention, and that was to attack him.</p><p>Obviously, it was impossible. Bazhun’an was nowhere to be found.</p><p>But should he give up just like that?</p><p>The saint calamity would not wait for anyone. When he saw Mu Ling’s miserable state in the midst of the lightning, Xu Xiaoshou could not just stand by and watch.</p><p>He stepped on the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon and shouted angrily.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>If there was no Bazhun’an, then he would create one!</p><p>The storm formed by the Swallow the Mountains and Rivers was like a huge rock that smashed into the sky. It swept away endless air waves and blasted into the saint calamity.</p><p>Everyone looked up and it was only at this moment they remembered that Xu Xiaoshou who had once stirred up trouble on the battlefield was still around..</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s existence could no longer be ignored in the Saint battle.</p><p>He looked weak, but his abilities were extraordinary.</p><p>Moreover, who would dare to ignore such a Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, even if it did not take any action?</p><p>Under the saint calamity, Mu Ling, who was covered in blood, looked sideways, and a trace of his unbearable suffering flashed in his eyes.</p><p>He wanted to call out to Xu Xiaoshou, but he knew that his telepathic communication would be intercepted by a demi-saint.</p><p>His communication with a Saint Servant would only lead to greater karma.</p><p>Under the saint calamity, Mu Ling found it hard to even open his mouth, let alone speak up.</p><p>At this moment, Mu Ling was in despair.</p><p>He had thought that he would be Xu Xiaoshou’s final trump card, but he did not expect the situation to take a turn for the worse. He was forced to this step by the combined forces of Water Ghost and Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>In fact, he even wanted Xu Xiaoshou, his martial nephew, to help him out.</p><p>In the midst of the lightning strikes, Dao Qiongcang also turned and his gaze flickered.</p><p>He had already calculated that the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon would not be able to attack again because there was nothing in the Mystery Boxes that would enable the Holy Emperor to attack.</p><p>Without the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, Xu Xiaoshou looked strong, but in fact, it was difficult for him to fight against a demi-saint head-on. His strength was in cooking up plans.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s aura was weaker than Mu Ling’s.</p><p>What was there to fear?</p><p>However, after this thought flashed past, Water Ghost suddenly cut through thousands of lightning bolts under the supreme saint calamity and leaped out.</p><p>“Hahahaha…”</p><p>He actually laughed out loud. He held onto half of the double-gold beast mask on his face and looked intently at Xu Xiaoshou. “Alright, since you’ve asked, I’ll give you face!”</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>He had even prepared The Four Pillars of Destiny Token and even secretly kicked Precious Dragon a few times. He wanted it to help him at the critical moment.</p><p>He did not expect that Water Ghost would immediately relent the moment he spoke.</p><p>Had he waited for him to speak up?</p><p>Do I have that much influence?</p><p>A hint of hesitation flashed across Xu Xiaoshou’s face.</p><p>He even turned around to confirm that Bazhun’an had not made an appearance behind him.</p><p>I used the Fantasy Sword Technique?</p><p>“There’s a situation!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang pondered as he transcended the tribulation.</p><p>He knew Water Ghost too well. This guy used to be Yu MO, who was lawless and arrogant.</p><p>When he was young, he didn’t even look up to Bazhun’an, and he himself was also not taken seriously.</p><p>Indeed, who did this master of the power of the Upanishad need to look up to in the world?</p><p>But at this moment, Water Ghost actually acceded to Xu Xiaoshou’s request because he was interested in Xu Xiaoshou’s future?</p><p>Definitely not!</p><p>People like Xu Xiaoshou, who could attain such brilliant achievements at such a young age, might still be rare in the Shengshen Continent, but there were still others.</p><p>Don’t look down, but look up. You Tu, Cao Yihan, Bei Huai, Hua Changdeng, and the others were all famous at a young age. They were not much worse than</p><p>Bazhun’an.</p><p>The fact that Water Ghost had relented at this time did not mean that Xu Xiaoshou had potential, but because Xu Xiaoshou still held a trump card! That was a trump card that was a threat to Water Ghost’s own life. That was why he relented.</p><p>“What was it?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
