(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“D*mned Eighth Brother, it hurts when the power enters your body…”</p><p>After he cursed silently, he stuffed the Communication Talisman back into his pocket. Even if he didn’t want to do it, under the pressure of the Holy Emperor, Xu Xiaoshou had no choice but to try.</p><p>As he drew upon the power of the white bead, Flame Python and Ember Heart, the void in the distance suddenly trembled, and a figure appeared!</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor did not have a physical form and what could be seen was only a vague outline.</p><p>However, the pressure he exuded after he entered the arena made even the chaotic Desolate Inferno Domain and the flowing lava tremble, as if they were afraid.</p><p>“Surrender or die.”</p><p>The statement uttered by this calm voice was similar to Xu Xiaoshou’s beratement of Bai Lian, but it was even more indifferent.</p><p>To the Holy Emperor, there were no longer many things or people in the world that were of interest to him.</p><p>Whether it was Mei Siren, Water Ghost, or Xu Xiaoshou who was a threat to</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor.</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor simply gave them a choice.</p><p>All living beings would err, regardless whether they were good or bad. As long as they knew their mistakes and were willing to correct them, they could be used to his advantage and it would be for the greater good.</p><p>What a pity.</p><p>Right now, there were three stubborn donkeys who stood in front of Rao</p><p>Wangze and didn’t respect the Holy Emperor!</p><p>“How much time do you need?”</p><p>Mei Siren’s expression was calm as he stepped out and stood in front of his student.</p><p>He didn’t waste any more words. The sword image condensed and his Sword Will rose into the air as if it intended to defy the will of Heaven.</p><p>A Swordsman would press forward with his indomitable will!</p><p>Lawlessness, no Saint, no Emperor!</p><p>“I will be injured again…”</p><p>Water Ghost let out a long sigh. As he took a step forward, his left hand subconsciously reached out and he pushed it in front of his face.</p><p>However, he froze, shook his head and laughed. “I’ve hidden myself away for too long. I’m not used to the light.’ Time…</p><p>“I don’t know how long it would take!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at the shadowy figure in the distance. His expression turned ferocious as the Art of Spiritual Array spiraled under his feet.</p><p>He took out the three items and also Patriarch Wuji’s incantation.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t need an array wheel. He only used the Divine Sorcerer’s thoughts to look at Abyss Island and the Desolate Inferno Domain.</p><p>He instantly sensed that this place still needed a catalyst to activate something extraordinary.</p><p>And that catalyst was him!</p><p>“Rao Wangze, then let me ask you… Surrender! Or die?”</p><p>When his momentum rose once more, it ignited the last sliver of the Holy Emperor power in his body…</p><p>Not only did Xu Xiaoshou’s emotions climb to the peak, but a berserk aura erupted from his whole being.</p><p>Everything in the world seemed to respond to him.</p><p>“Yes…”</p><p>The white bead trembled again.</p><p>Spurts of scorching hot energy poured in again.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Ember Heart was awakened as well and pure white flames shot out from Xu Xiaoshou’s body.</p><p>The Desolate Inferno Domain was a sea of fire, and the infernal aura spread out strongly in all directions.</p><p>“Buzz! ”</p><p>Where Flame Python learned this move from was unknown, but after it twisted, it suddenly straightened up, trembled and was completely relaxed and excited.</p><p>The silver sword cognition swept out from the edge of the sword and pointed toward the sky as if it provided some sort of guidance for Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Hurry!”</p><p>“Quick, look over!”</p><p>The group of survivors from the First Hall of Sins barely had time to celebrate.</p><p>They already sensed the smoke of war that rose on the other side.</p><p>The big man, who sweated profusely, was carried on the shoulders of four people and opened the spirit mirror. He seemed to be exhausted and on the brink of collapse.</p><p>The image showed Wangze Holy Emperor, who hovered in the sky.</p><p>Opposite him was Xu Xiaoshou, who stood behind his guardians, Mei Siren and Water Ghost. He was bathed in white flames and pointed his sword at the sky.</p><p>How do I put it…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt countless gazes on him.</p><p>Once upon a time, this was the scene he had dreamed of where he shouted loudly amidst the crowd and his Passive Points rose rapidly.</p><p>Therefore, he held his sword up and with his mighty aura, sang out in a domineering manner.</p><p>“My eyes would no longer be covered today! I want this land… Aaah!”</p><p>Before he finished his speech, the white bead, Ember Heart and Flame Python connected. The power of the three erupted and pulled out even more Holy Emperor power than before.</p><p>This power was no longer as mild as before, a power that could be borrowed.</p><p>It was crude, unreasonable, and reckless!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou choked on his saliva. He bent over and cupped his stomach without any regard for his image.</p><p>As he bent over, flames spewed from his seven orifices and his entire body split open. White flames shot out, but his aura soared.</p><p>“+(Attacked, Passive Points+)+l.”</p><p>“+(Attacked, Passive Points+)+l.”</p><p>The Information Bar popped up continuously.</p><p>The beast desire that belonged to the Berserk Giant was about to be magnified in his mind, but Xu Xiaoshou knew that he could not be willful in this fight.</p><p>When he borrowed the power of a Holy Emperor to fight a demi-saint, it allowed him to punch Rao Yaoyao and kick the Bodhisattva.</p><p>However, when he used it to fight against a Holy Emperor, it was no different from hitting a rock with an egg.</p><p>“Array…”</p><p>As he thought of the incantation, Xu Xiaoshou’s spiritual senses that had been strengthened to the level of a saint’s will, spread out and covered Abyss Island.</p><p>In an instant, he saw the Si Wu Formation with incomparable clarity.</p><p>“The key to break out of this situation is still here!”</p><p>However, the 374 array eyes on his spiritual senses met with a resistance from the intangible great array; it was no longer as supple as before.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>Outside the battlefield, Dao Qiongcang held the divine Sinan, and the star dipper on it spun rapidly.</p><p>He had already left the battlefield, but he had never thought that he would be dragged into it in this way.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou now tried to seize control of the Si Wu Formation, so how could he turn a blind eye?</p><p>Just as he was about to exert his strength…</p><p>“Yes…”</p><p>A series of melodious sword cries sounded from the ruins of the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>It was very faint, but it had a strong penetrating power as it swept through the</p><p>Nine Heavens.</p><p>“What’s that sound?”</p><p>The spectators from the First Hall of Sins looked around.</p><p>Someone slapped the unconscious man to awaken him. “Quick, look for it!”</p><p>“This sound…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao tilted her head and looked around, her eyes filled with bewilderment.</p><p>Others might not be able to hear it, but to her, this series of sword cries was too iconic..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
