(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio     Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>When a Holy Emperor passed through the Yunlun Mountain Range, it was a cause for worry.</p><p>The battle of Sky City was also a cause for worry.</p><p>But aside from the battlefield, there were still people who searched for a way to survive at the White Tiger gate, one of the four gates of the giant kingdom.</p><p>“I can’t get out, I can’t get out at all…”</p><p>The fist-sized ferret Elder Han had a bitter expression on its face. It had already wasted too much time at the White Tiger gate.</p><p>It had used all kinds of methods!</p><p>Originally, after it left the First Hall of Sins, it had split up with Lord Shou. It was the Frost Ferret and had the Super Saint Escape Technique.</p><p>As long as it found any exit door, it would be able to escape without the void token.</p><p>At this point, it was a vast space for one to display one’s talent.</p><p>However, when the chaotic battle in the Fallen Abyss broke out, Water Ghost appeared with his trident and Xu Xiaoshou received the power of the Holy Emperor…</p><p>Elder Han had exhausted its entire life’s efforts and failed to find a breakthrough point. However, it had concluded a rule that everyone on the island had ignored:</p><p>“Abyss Island. You can only enter but you can’t leave?”</p><p>With its saint’s will, Elder Han could vaguely see that there were still stowaways that came in. This proved that there was no problem to come in from the outside world.</p><p>But it couldn’t get out…</p><p>What did this mean?</p><p>Elder Han didn’t dare to think too much. It was too afraid to overthink.</p><p>Even with its intelligence, it could tell that this meant that Abyss Island had become a closed prison.</p><p>Even if a demi-saint or a Holy Emperor died here, they would have died in vain if they couldn’t call for help!</p><p>Then…</p><p>Who came up with this rule of ‘only entry, no exit?’ How did they do it? What was their real purpose?</p><p>Elder Han could only pray that this was the rule set by Bazhun’an.</p><p>In this way, it would still have a chance to live and not be taken down by the people of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>On the battlefield, Elder Han didn’t dare to get close.</p><p>Since it had not received Lord Shou’s call, it had quietly waited and maintained its smallest body size while it concealed itself.</p><p>The battle on the Outer Island was even more exciting than on the Inner Island. The Cutting Path and higher void on the island still had the courage to watch.</p><p>As a demi-saint, Elder Han trembled in fear. It was as if it had returned to the position of a younger brother on the Inner Island. It felt afraid and imagined it was surrounded by enemies.</p><p>This state of fear was maintained on the Desolate Inferno Domain as Xu Xiaoshou received the power of the Holy Emperor for the second time.</p><p>“Weng…”</p><p>At this moment, the Corner of Divine Prison jumped out.</p><p>This was a gift from Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison on the Inner Island. After he met Xu Xiaoshou in the Zhen Huang Palace, he didn’t want it, so he kept it with Elder Han.</p><p>“What was that?”</p><p>Elder Han was startled by its own protective talisman and broke out in cold sweat.</p><p>After it reacted, it heaved a sigh of relief, but it quickly became nervous.</p><p>This was because the Corner of Divine Prison fluctuated greatly and its aura increased rapidly. It seemed to have followed Xu Xiaoshou on the Desolate Inferno Domain as it guided the power of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>In the end, Elder Han could clearly sense with its Perception that the purest and thickest aura that belonged to Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison emanated from the Corner of Divine Prison. Previously it had not shown any unusual movements.</p><p>Plop!</p><p>Elder Han’s little knees immediately hit the floor. It lowered its head and said in a fearful voice, “Divine Prison Lord Qing Shi?”</p><p>It couldn’t see where Divine Prison Lord Qing Shi was.</p><p>However, this aura was so strong that it felt like he was there in person, so how could it not be fearful?</p><p>When it didn’t receive any response, Elder Han heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p>It pressed against the ground as it tried to prop up its body that was about to turn into a puddle of water.</p><p>At this moment, a large ball of blurry energy flew into the White Tiger gate and entered the Corner of Divine Prison.</p><p>The floating green stone trembled and projected the voice of Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison.</p><p>“Prepare to accommodate.”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Elder Han prostrated itself on the ground as if in worship. It let out an ear-piercing scream.</p><p>“Ah, yes!”</p><p>Beside the Vermilion Bird Gate.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man clad in an orange robe hid in the Deadly Path like one of the dead, and no one noticed him.</p><p>Someone tried to get out by the door. They tried all kinds of methods, but they could never get out.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man had hidden himself for a long time.</p><p>He had long been aware that he couldn’t get out of Abyss Island!</p><p>Ever since he was discovered by Water Ghost and was almost killed, and after he was saved by Xu Xiaoshou’s pleas, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had withdrawn from the battlefield.</p><p>The most terrifying thing about the Blood World Pearl was not that it provided Guidance to others, but that its guidance could lead the host to death.</p><p>Huang Quan’s mission was to stay on Abyss Island. It was good to stay and use the Blood World Pearl to cause trouble. However, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man did not want to execute it at all!</p><p>He was afraid that he would die here and regret it for the rest of his life.</p><p>However, even if he wanted to leave, he couldn’t!</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man had been forced to stay by the Vermillion</p><p>Bird gate. He watched the battlefield as he waited for an opportunity to escape.</p><p>However, Abyss Island had become a big urn with a closed mouth. The secondary plane door was with Water Ghost and this was most likely his doing.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man had a premonition that he probably wouldn’t be able to wait for an opportunity; he could only wait for an accident to happen.</p><p>The pace at the battlefield was very fast.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou received the power of the Holy Emperor from the first time and entered the second time.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou became the array eye of the Si Wu Formation and emerged as one of the channels to communicate with the power of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>The Blood World Pearl on the Five Decays of Heaven and Man who hid in the Deadly Path, suddenly jumped out and appeared above his head.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>A red light flashed, and a pain that felt like the pricking of a needle invaded the depths of his mind.</p><p>“Uhh!”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man covered his head, and he was in so much pain that he wanted to die. He floated out of the Great Path.</p><p>The power in his body instantly went out of control. The terrifying decaying fog combined with the overflowing power of the Blood World Pearl caused more than ten people who had gathered by the Vermilion Bird Gate to die instantly.</p><p>“Pa, pa, pa!”</p><p>Streaks of blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>Waves of energy surged into the Blood World Pearl.</p><p>Devouring, refining, fusing… It was like a sacrificial ritual..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
