(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>She didn’t enter the mortal world, but she could experience it through the secret realm of the Holy Emperor and get an insight into life. She finally entered the path with the emotion sword technique and won the title of the Seven Sword Deity.</p><p>She…</p><p>She still had too many ‘extraordinary’ qualities that no one else could measure up to.</p><p>However, when she flipped through the countless glorious past experiences, it turned out to be just a life scroll with golden edges. The contents were all drawn by outsiders. Like most of the so-called ‘talented ones’, they were tasteless and also a pity if it were to be thrown away.</p><p>Other than excellence, there was only excellence left.</p><p>It seemed that the only outcome for people like her was a crushing defeat.</p><p>“What exactly am I living for?”</p><p>As the storm approached, Xu Xiaoshou’s killing intent was revealed. This was the first time Rao Yaoyao saw a real person who did not put up any pretense in front of her.</p><p>She had experienced the mortal world and had seen through it. She specialized in the emotion sword technique, but she did not have an unforgettable love, nor did she have any family member that she could confide in.</p><p>There was no one around her that she could trust. She could only rely on herself forever, even if it were her peers or elders in the clan.</p><p>She had too many suitors and too many enemies, but all of them wore thick masks. It was not a clear cut pursuit nor were the enemies openly enemies.</p><p>In the past, there seemed to be an invisible hand that guided her and taught her how to grow and how to become outstanding.</p><p>Step by step, it was the same.</p><p>In the end, when she looked back, Rao Yaoyao realized that Xu Xiaoshou was the most truthful person who stood before her.</p><p>Only he dared to reveal his true hostility, take off his mask, and reveal his killing intent.</p><p>The ones before were all puppets controlled by the Holy Emperor. They were all toys!</p><p>“What if I’m not me, but someone else?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had lost everything in the storm, but she suddenly realized that if Rao Yaoyao didn’t exist in this world, it wouldn’t have mattered much.</p><p>The next sets of Rao Yaoyao would appear and her life would be repeated.</p><p>Her excellence could be replicated.</p><p>The failure of Bazhun’an, whom she looked down on, the decadence of Hua Changdeng… The setbacks that everyone in the world experienced but she did not, were the true traces of a person’s life. They were the leaves and the light.</p><p>Was that so?</p><p>However, if the era evolved to the point where even excellence was lost to the masses, and only setbacks could forge true glory, wouldn’t that be an absolute and a tragedy?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao couldn’t find the answer.</p><p>She hated this kind of question the most. In the past, she would struggle to find the answer, but now she simply closed her eyes.</p><p>“I have nothing…”</p><p>She emerged from the storm and now it was about to destroy her.</p><p>At the last moment, even the divine sword Xuan Cang tried to protect itself. It struggled to break free from the shackles, unwilling to die under such power.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao laughed instead.</p><p>It was wonderful to practice the sword all her life and yet in the end, it abandoned her.</p><p>However, Xuan Cang was not hers to begin with. It did not mean she would obtain everything even if she forcibly possessed it.</p><p>When the glorious appearance was removed, it was normal for those who should leave to depart.</p><p>However, just when Rao Yaoyao was in complete despair…</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>Sword cries filled with intense emotions emerged from the broken spatial ring and a pile of junk that had been sealed for a long time.</p><p>On the ruins of the First Hall of Sins, a faint light suddenly flashed amid the storm, followed by a series of mournful cries.</p><p>It was a sorrowful song that had been suppressed for a long time.</p><p>When its pitch was high, it was like music as it resounded among the clouds in the sky. When it was low, it was like the song of the world, full of tears and complaints.</p><p>It was this song that stopped the terrifying storm for a moment as it revealed its intangible presence in the midst of destruction.</p><p>Countless people felt the same sorrow. They looked up with tears in their eyes. What they saw was a scattered and ethereal sword light.</p><p>“Sword light?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was stunned.</p><p>There’s still a sword that’s willing to stand up for me?</p><p>As she stared at the broken sword in front of her, she seemed to have understood something and felt endless regret. She wanted to keep it, but she could not do anything.</p><p>“Singer of the Stars and Moon…”</p><p>The sword that had accompanied her all her life.</p><p>From the third grade to the current grade, a sword spirit was also born.</p><p>She, Rao Yaoyao, had no one to rely on or trust. However, as a swordsman, this initial saber could absolutely be trusted!</p><p>However, she became one of the red-clothed people and to wield a first grade sword was no longer in line with her status as Rao Yaoyao-or so Rao Yaoyao thought.</p><p>Most of the time, Rao Yaoyao chose to try to control the divine sword Xuan Cang, one of the Five Great Divine Instruments of Chaos. This suited her status, but she failed time and time again.</p><p>Now, when her end neared, the divine sword Xuan Cang abandoned her, but the Singer of the Stars and Moon had taken the initiative to show up and chose to fulfill her wish.</p><p>Her physical body and soul were shattered.</p><p>She, Rao Yaoyao, had yearned for countless years to reach the Heavenly Unravel realm. Xuan Cang didn’t let her achieve her wish, but the Singer of the Stars and Moon could!</p><p>In a situation where its owner had no more intent left and had completely forgotten about it…</p><p>This grade one spiritual sword took the initiative to execute the ‘corpse dissolution’ at this moment and place. It turned into a swan song and brought a wisp of its owner’s soul into the Heavenly Unravel realm and escaped into the</p><p>Nine Heavens.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao wanted to stop but couldn’t.</p><p>She finally understood that this family member had always been by her side but had been forgotten by her.</p><p>She finally realized that she did not have anything.</p><p>Not all companions could talk, and no one had stipulated that the road had to go forward. People had to learn to stop and look back.</p><p>But Rao Yaoyao didn’t.</p><p>She kept looking forward, but she ignored the company behind her.</p><p>When she realized this…</p><p>She really had nothing left!</p><p>Heavenly Unravel, was that such a beautiful vision?</p><p>When the ancient swordsman cultivated the Heavenly Unravel, it would be famous worldwide and recorded in history..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
