(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>An illusory figure whose limbs were shackled with broken chains stood on top of it. The image was blurry and his true appearance could not be seen.</p><p>“Holy Emperor! ”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s teeth chattered.</p><p>When the Holy Emperor passed through, all living beings prostrated themselves.</p><p>At this moment, the entire Yunlun Mountain Range shook. Even though the trial-takers had the protection of the Cloud Mirror World, they still fell to the ground, one after another.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen didn’t lower her head. She endured the pain and stubbornly looked up.</p><p>In her last glance, she saw that the Saint on the sea of fire had lowered his head and gave her an indifferent stare. It was as if he looked at a commoner and the only person in the world who did not bow to him.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>The strange sound was not directed at her.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s pupils trembled as she realized something, “Clothes, take off your red clothes! ”</p><p>When she lowered her head.</p><p>Lan Ling was slowly being reduced to ashes.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s brows furrowed as she let out a cry. Her eyes were filled with tears, but they were rapidly evaporated by the high temperature.</p><p>Through the Cloud Mirror World, she had personally seen that the Holy Emperor did not intentionally harm the trial-takers when the sea of fire passed.</p><p>However, except for the plain-clothed trial officers, all the red-clothed people in the Yunlun Mountain Range were set ablaze by the white flames.</p><p>Lan Ling was one of those, together with the rest of the red-clothed people!</p><p>“Ghost beast…”</p><p>“They are ghost beasts, and the natural enemy of ghost beasts are the red-clothed people…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen wasn’t one of the red-clothed people after all. It was already too late when she realized this.</p><p>She was not clad in a red robe, so she wasn’t affected by the Holy Emperor’s aura. Only Lan Ling died.</p><p>She saved Lan Ling, but she didn’t realize this in time and did not take off Lan Ling’s red robe. This caused Lan Ling to be ignited again.</p><p>“Sorry, sorry…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen couldn’t help but shake her head. She frantically used the Divine Secret to try and block Lan Ling from the damage of the Holy Emperor’s power, but she was unable to do so.</p><p>She drank the Holy Blood. She ignored the surging power that raged in her body as she tried desperately to extinguish the white flames.</p><p>The Holy Emperor left.</p><p>The blood tree phantom, the remnant form of the green prison and the meandering black dragon followed closely behind.</p><p>They flew towards the Lone Cliff, crashed into Abyss Island and disappeared.</p><p>They could not maintain their power.</p><p>The white flames were naturally extinguished by the Holy Power.</p><p>However, the weight in her arms was immeasurable.</p><p>Only half of Lan Ling’s face was left, and even her soul had been burned through. There was no way she could be resurrected.</p><p>“Sorry, sorry…” Yu Zhiwen’s eyes were filled with tears, only guilt remained.</p><p>“No need to apologize.” What remained of Lan Ling’s spirit tried its best to form the outline of a gentle big sister. It wanted to wipe away Yu Zhiwen’s tears, but it passed through her.</p><p>She had many things she wanted to say. This was the hatred between the red-clothed people and the ghost beast; it was not Sister Zhiwen’s fault.</p><p>She wanted to comfort Sister Zhiwen because she knew that she was a kind and obedient girl. How sad would she be if she died in her presence?</p><p>But there was no time.</p><p>Lan Ling used the last of her strength to tear off the badge of the red-clothed people that was on her chest. It had been burned to half its size by the white flames.</p><p>“Give it to him…”</p><p>“What is it? Sister Lan Ling, what did you say…” Yu Zhiwen wiped her tears and leaned over as she tried to listen to what she said. Suddenly, she realized something. “No, don’t talk anymore. I can protect your remnant spirit. I can bring you back to the Saint Mountain. I can recover…”</p><p>“Hundreds of red-clothed people died together. I’m no longer important.” Lan Ling interrupted with a smile. “Give this to him if he’s still alive…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen finally heard the telepathic communication clearly. She took the half of the badge of the red-clothed people and when she looked at it, tears welled up in her eyes.</p><p>“Hand it over to Elder Night Guardian?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“I will, I will definitely do it! Elder Night Guardian must still be alive!</p><p>Definitely! ”</p><p>“Give it to him, tell him…”</p><p>“Don’t talk anymore. Sob, sob, sister Lan Ling…”</p><p>Lan Ling’s remnant soul shattered. Before she died, she looked at the sky and seemed to see the scene during her childhood, when she swore to join the red-clothed people.</p><p>She!</p><p>Together with her teammates, they had to break their promise and leave the human world first as a first step.</p><p>But even if there was only one person left in the team, they had to keep their promise.</p><p>The White Cave was still worth it!</p><p>Even if the seal was broken, even if he had returned to the Infernal Hell Sea!</p><p>“Tell him…” The faint and barely audible voice drifted away in the wind together with the ashes.</p><p>“Swear your allegiance to Night Guardian. Don’t forget my original intentions.”</p><p>Little Junior Sister, White Cave</p><p>MO MO, Liu Changqing, Elder Han</p><p>“I told you, you don’t need my array wheel anymore.”</p><p>In the Forest of Miracles, Bazhun’an smiled as if he could see Xu Xiashou’s shocked expression when he received the power..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
