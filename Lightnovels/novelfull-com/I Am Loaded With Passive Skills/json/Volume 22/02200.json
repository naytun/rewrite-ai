(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Dao Qiongcang could accept both developments and would not lose out.</p><p>Therefore, Dao Qiongcang had regrets that Rao Yaoyao couldn’t become his Sharpness sword.</p><p>But that was all.</p><p>He was not a person who would dwell on the past.</p><p>Compared to the Rao clan’s sword whetstone, that had sharpened Xu Xiaoshou’s world-shocking famed sword in advance, Dao Qiongcan felt that Rao Yaoyao had died a worthy death.</p><p>She was a chess piece that was only worth eight points and had overachieved her mission:</p><p>He had intentionally roused the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, broken the balance of the five Holy Emperors aristocratic families and forced Bazhun’an to reveal his trump card in advance. This had also placed the immature Xu Xiaoshou in the limelight and attracted a lot of attention.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s death was worth it!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang didn’t know how long it would take for Xu Xiaoshou to recover after he lost the power of the Holy Emperor overnight and reverted to the demi-saint Sovereign Dao Realm.</p><p>However, he knew that this kid’s ambition was even greater than Bazhun’an’s, and his abilities were stronger. His foundational roots were as solid as a rock and that meant it would be even harder to kill him!</p><p>During this period of his growth, even if the process was very short, could he withstand so many gazes, including the gaze of the Holy Emperor?</p><p>Death through flattery was the most intangible way to kill a person.</p><p>After Xu Xiaoshou was done on Abyss Island, he would be roasted by the world. Whether he would become a roast pig or a true gold that was not afraid of fire, Dao Qiongcang would wait and see.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao who had finished his calculations on the pros and cons in a short period of time quickly turned his gaze to the other side. He saw that</p><p>Bazhun’an had been brought into the battle by the newly awakened Mei Siren.</p><p>He believed that the current Xu Xiaoshou could not think of so many follow-ups, but Bazhun’an could.</p><p>That was why it was said that this person was really arrogant. He actually believed that Xu Xiaoshou could successfully kill his way out of the storm.</p><p>Life and death, success or failure, it was all in the future.</p><p>So, Xu Xiaoshou, how will you develop?</p><p>Will you walk the path I have arranged for you and be used by me?</p><p>There was a hint of anticipation in Dao Qiongcang’s eyes.</p><p>“So tired…”</p><p>“I’ve reached the top. I can’t hold on any longer…”</p><p>After he returned from the spatial crack, Xu Xiaoshou’s energy flowed away like a receding tide.</p><p>He was so weak that he almost fainted and staggered in the air.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!” A fragrant breeze blew across his face, and the silver-haired Lei Xi’er flashed forward and supported the weak Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Lean on me.” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes drooped and his body split open. He almost fell from the sky. He tilted his head and rested in his little junior sister’s soft arms. It was rare for him to feel so at ease.</p><p>“Good! You rest first.” When she saw this, Lei Xi’er’s eyes flashed with a hint of heartache.</p><p>It was hard to imagine how much pain she would suffer if she undertook the power of one Holy Emperor. She could not visualize the extent of Xu Xiaoshou’s pain, being the center of the Four Divine Pillars after he received the power of the four Holy Emperors.</p><p>Not to mention that after that, he crossed the spatial fragment with his exhausted body and used the Wisdom is Emptiness technique.</p><p>This guy used to have a body that would never be depleted no matter how much energy he used. He was as strong as an ox and had unlimited energy.</p><p>Now, it was as if all the blood essence in his body had been sucked dry!</p><p>Lei Xi’er knew that the second realm of the Ancient Sword Technique was not so easy to obtain.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had somehow managed to borrow such a breath, but after that sword attack, his vitality and vigor had probably been completely drained along with the Wisdom is Emptiness.</p><p>“Can Xu Xiaoshou’s foundational roots really recover from this kind of damage…”</p><p>“He’s still pushing himself too hard. He clearly doesn’t have to do this for</p><p>Bazhun’an!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er didn’t know why, but her heart clenched and her brows furrowed. She quickly realized that she was affected by Mu Zixi.</p><p>Her God Devil Eyes swiveled and her expression returned to normal. She picked up Xu Xiaoshou and swallowed all the remaining devilish energy from his body.</p><p>“Phew!”</p><p>The life essence of her body faintly dissipated and was passively absorbed by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Not only did this not affect Lei Xi’er’s physical condition, but it also made her look more mature and beautiful.</p><p>The Ultimate Life Demon Physique constantly swallowed life force to nourish her. The more she released, the more she would recover.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…” In the distance, Xiao Kongtong saw that Xu Xiaoshou was so weak that he couldn’t even protect himself. He subconsciously wanted to go forward.</p><p>Zhu Yike pulled him back. “What are you doing?”</p><p>“Why did you hold me back?” Xiao Kongtong glared at him. Didn’t this guy care at all?</p><p>The two of them had already completed many exchanges in the Yuan Mansion and could be considered as half-friends.</p><p>“Why do you want to go over?”</p><p>“I am concerned! Xu Xiaoshou is like half a junior brother to me!”</p><p>“Is it your turn to care? It would be too intrusive for you to go up now.” Zhu Yike held his forehead.</p><p>“How am I being intrusive?”</p><p>“Which part of you isn’t intrusive?”</p><p>Zhu Yike pulled Xiao Kongtong back. He only knew how to fight and had no foresight and pointed subtly with a smirk that filled his whole face.</p><p>“Look, the two of them are so in tune with each other…</p><p>Xiao Kongtong followed his finger and looked over.</p><p>In the sky above the ruins, a woman with silver hair that fluttered in the wind, who wore a green short skirt that did not match her graceful figure. In her arms was the Great Demon King Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>No matter how one looked at the scene, the two of them had their own unique points, but when combined, it was very pleasing to the eye.</p><p>The priorities seemed to have been reversed, but did it matter?</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s appearance was beyond description. She looked tender and graceful and presented a beautiful picture. She didn’t say anything, and her aura was as serene as an orchid.</p><p>Even if there were dust on her face, it still could not hide her cold and enchanting temperament. Instead, it added a little bit of the earthly aura of a fairy who had fallen into the mortal world and made it even more real..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
