(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>His plan was perfect.</p><p>He entered Dao Qiongcang’s body and used the supreme saint calamity and the secondary plane door to seal his power and weaken his state.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was in the Desolate Inferno Domain, under the influence of Ember Heart and he had inherited the power of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>He, Water Ghost exerted the control while Xu Xiaoshou caused the damage.</p><p>Even if Dao Qiongcang still had strength left, as long as he was controlled for a moment, he could still slash him into the Desolate Inferno Domain.</p><p>Even if it was just a body!</p><p>After this battle, Dao Qiongcang’s vitality would be greatly damaged.</p><p>His reputation for being unpredictable would no longer exist. The people in the world who were anxious and uncertain would know which side to choose.</p><p>Abyss Island was in its final-stage!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was renowned in the five regions, and this was also what Bazhun’an wanted to see!</p><p>Who would have thought…</p><p>After he received the power, Xu Xiaoshou went berserk!</p><p>He even wanted to kill Dao Qiongcang and Water Ghost; this forced the two of them to temporarily join forces.</p><p>As for Water Ghost who resided in a human body, he was completely at a disadvantage and in a dangerous situation.</p><p>One careless move and the whole game would be lost, nothing more.</p><p>“Wake up, Xu Xiaoshou!” Water Ghost shouted. His tone was filled with reluctance. He hoped that Xu Xiaoshou would remember that he owed him a</p><p>favor.</p><p>Bazhun’an had said before that Xu Xiaoshou was very determined and could withstand the power of a Holy Emperor.</p><p>Moreover, the Infernal lineage was known for their ability to endure the most horrific pain. Even though Xu Xiaoshou was a little weak, he was slated to be Bazhun’an’s designated successor, so it was impossible that he could not withstand this pain.</p><p>So, would there be a chance?</p><p>Everyone could see how Xu Xiaoshou’s body trembled from the pain. He opened his mouth amid the endless white flames.</p><p>“Who says I’m not calm?”</p><p>The Nine Heavens supreme saint calamity had mutated again and locked onto Xu Xiaoshou. However, Xu Xiaoshou tilted Flame Python, and the sword light shattered the thunder calamity into countless pieces.</p><p>Lightning streaked across the sky and it was a beautiful sight as it looked like a shower of falling stars.</p><p>“Even the supreme saint calamity could not affect Xu Xiaoshou…” The spectators below were shocked.</p><p>This Xu Xiaoshou who had suddenly gone berserk was a completely different person from the brat he was before.</p><p>One was a God, and the other was a mere ant.</p><p>“You’re rational now?” Water Ghost was shocked.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was also slightly surprised. It couldn’t be a better time to communicate with him. “Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>“Shut up!” Xu Xiaoshou shouted aggressively at both Water Ghost and Dao Qiongcang and startled everyone.</p><p>When he heard the outsiders speaking, he felt a dull pain in his head.</p><p>The power in his body overflowed again, and he could not stop it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not waste any more words. He pointed his sword at Dao Qiongcang and said calmly.</p><p>“Water Ghost, wait a moment. After I kill this Elder Dao the Flamboyant, I’ll protect you from the tribulation… Don’t worry, I’m invincible now.”</p><p>Water Ghost was shocked.</p><p>After what you’ve said, are you still rational? B*llshit!</p><p>When you slice Dao Qiongcang apart, I’ll also be split into two by you, alright?</p><p>“I’m still inside his body!” “Don’t worry, I know what to do.” “Cut the crap! Save me first!”</p><p>Water Ghost panicked.</p><p>He had not even been this flustered when he was being beaten up during the time he Dretended to be his son.</p><p>Bazhun’an had said that they could rely on Xu Xiaoshou, but not entirely, because he was not very reliable.</p><p>Water Ghost was not aware before, but could Xu Xiaoshou be that easily manipulated?</p><p>Now he understood.</p><p>This kid had developed too quickly!</p><p>Previously, he could manipulate him because his strength and trump cards were limited.</p><p>Once the power he held exceeded the limit, no one would be able to control him!</p><p>Water Ghost did not want to follow the plan.</p><p>He only wanted to get out of Dao Qiongcang’s body. No matter how important the plan was, his life mattered more.</p><p>If he was really struck by Xu Xiaoshou’s sword, he would become the biggest laughing stock in the world. A Upanishad demi-saint died in the hands of a Sovereign Dao Realm!</p><p>While the two sides were in a stalemate, a sword light suddenly slashed over from the Fallen Abyss. At the same time, a furious voice sounded.</p><p>“Water Ghost, how dare you humiliate me?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
