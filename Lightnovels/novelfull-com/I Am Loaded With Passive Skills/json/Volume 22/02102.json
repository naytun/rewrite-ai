I want to watch the battle!”</p><p>If the situation demanded it, he still had to assist Water Ghost, as they were all on the same boat now. Of course, Xu Xiaoshou would never openly state this.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon soared into the air, instantly crossing the void from the Fallen Abyss to the Blood World.</p><p>What Xu Xiaoshou could not discern, as the thought incarnation of the Holy Emperor, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon could see at a glance.</p><p>“Spirit mirror, keep up!”</p><p>“Brother, what are you doing? You’re so slow!”</p><p>The ruins of the First Hall of Sins resounded with the curses of all present. They grabbed the burly man and pressed him to search for the true body of the Water Ghost.</p><p>In the Blood World, the crimson blood merged with the ink-black rain, creating a magnificent spectacle.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou arrived with the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, he could already distinguish the aura of the “real demi-saint person” with his “Perception.”</p><p>He gazed intently, only to discover that the real Water Ghost’s blood had not yet merged into the demi-saint person, and somehow, Dao Qiongcang had already caught up.</p><p>“In my presence, do you think you can jump at the chance to sanctify yourself? Have I given you the opportunity?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang shouted in a frosty tone, and the star dipper on his divine Sinan spun, causing the pouring rain on Abyss Island to pause for a moment.</p><p>Then, the sky brightened!</p><p>In a moment of shock, Xu Xiaoshou raised his gaze and saw the Divine Path Principles manifest, transforming into a gigantic Celestial Scroll in the sky, which covered the entire Abyss Island.</p><p>Countless Divine Path patterns of light shot out from the scroll.</p><p>Each of these Divine Path patterns of light was incredibly fine, piercing through every raindrop in the pouring rain, every Water Ghost clone on the Abyss Island, as well as the real and fake demi-saint person.</p><p>“Divine Thirty-Six Form, Great Embroidery Technique!”</p><p>When this calm voice descended, the Divine Path patterns of light outlined a majestic and grand embroidered diagram on the entire Abyss Island.</p><p>The scattered raindrops turned into dewdrops…</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was like the rising sun…</p><p>And before him was the purified Water Ghost with a pallid face.</p><p>“The Dawn Illuminating Rain Diagram!” Dao Qiongcang said with a gentle smile. “This is my gift to you.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p>Was this not similar to the Weaving Expertise?</p><p>However, the scope of Dao Qiongcang’s “weave” was simply immense!!</p><p>In a split second, he used the Divine Path Principles as threads, passing through every drop of rain belonging to the Water Ghost on the Abyss Island.</p><p>In this situation, as long as he made a move…</p><p>Dao Qiongcang certainly made use of the star dipper on his divine Sinan!</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>The dark clouds in the sky dissipated in the next moment.</p><p>The pouring rain was completely purified by the Divine Secret, and Abyss Island restored its brightness.</p><p>Gasps of astonishment resounded all over the island.</p><p>In this move, how exquisite a control did it require? How much mental strength did it demand?</p><p>But Dao Qiongcang, as if it was as easy as breathing, did not even break a sweat.</p><p>With a powerful blast, the form of the Water Ghost shattered on the spot.</p><p>The demi-saint did not merely explode; it was a deliberate act of the Water Ghost.</p><p>The pouring rain on Abyss Island had been completely purified.</p><p>However, the “rainwater” that had fallen all over the island still contained remnants of the Water Ghost’s power, which could not be eradicated in a short time even by a demi-saint.</p><p>“There’s still a chance…”</p><p>“Water Ghost, there’s still a chance!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou watched anxiously, wishing he could step into the arena himself, but he knew that if he did, he would be in worse shape than the Water Ghost. So, he remained perched on the dragon’s head, filled with anxiety.</p><p>Doing nothing meant no mistakes and staying alive.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The sky held the Celestial Scroll.</p><p>The earth lit up with a water-type Power Upanishad Formation.</p><p>In an instant, countless water mists emerged, and the Water Ghost flashed from the Blood World to Azure Marsh.</p><p>This swamp was his backup plan!</p><p>“Precious dragon…”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon did not wait for a prompt. It whisked Xu Xiaoshou away to the Azure Marsh in a flash.</p><p>“Damn, hurry up!”</p><p>The burly man on the ruins of First Hall of Sins was being urged once again, now sweating profusely.</p><p>Just a moment ago, he had been a tad late in making the switch. Everyone witnessed only the final moments of Hallmaster Dao’s strike in Blood World, and because of that, he was almost beaten to death by the crowd!</p><p>Now, they could not afford to waste a second. The big man urgently searched, and the scene quickly locked onto Azure Marsh.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, did you predict this too?”</p><p>On Azure Marsh, the true body of the Water Ghost leaped out from underground.</p><p>He smiled gracefully, holding onto the golden beast mask as blood flowed and merged with the demi-saint person.</p><p>The process was incredibly smooth, without any signs of delay or obstruction.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The Divine Path Principles moved again, and Dao Qiongcang followed once more, but this time, he was a fraction slower.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The heavens shook.</p><p>An aura of saint calamity spread over the Azure Marsh.</p><p>This place was now experiencing its second saint calamity.</p><p>“Did the Water Ghost win?”</p><p>Not only the spiritual cultivators in the First Hall of Sins but also Xu Xiaoshou and the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon were amazed by the Water Ghost’s unpredictable methods.</p><p>How many tricks did this guy have up his sleeve?</p><p>This was a higher void fighting a demi-saint, not to mention the enigmatic Dao Qiongcang, and he still managed to come out on top!</p><p>Was he not afraid of causing his own demise?</p><p>However, as everyone directed their gaze toward Dao Qiongcang, not a hint of surprise or bewilderment registered on his face.</p><p>On the contrary, there was a smile, even broader than that of the Water Ghost.</p><p>“A target as vast as Azure Marsh, sanctified and brimming with water reserves, could easily slip from one’s thoughts, wouldn’t you agree?”</p><p>“But if I were an ordinary person and thought the same way, how could I be Dao Qiongcang?”</p><p>As the saint calamity descended, this time, Dao Qiongcang did not even move the star dipper on his divine Sinan. He simply reached out and snapped his fingers.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
