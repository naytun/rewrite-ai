(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>If the Upanishad demi-saint couldn’t step forward at that time, the situation would be completely in Dao Qiongcang’s favor.</p><p>At the end of the day, Water Ghost’s sanctification would end the game.</p><p>“Awesome!”</p><p>After he sent Elder Dao the Flamboyant flying with a punch, Xu Xiaoshou waved his fists in triumph around the Sleeping Valley. He felt even better than when he had sent Yan Wuse flying.</p><p>The power of a Holy Emperor’s strike was basically as powerful as a Passive Fist.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had never thought that Xu Xiaoshou’s battle intelligence would be so high that he could even trick him so directly.</p><p>“Heh, in terms of combat, you really can’t compare to your Divine Oracle!”</p><p>“You actually looked down on me like this. Did you really think I was that irrational?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suppressed his excitement and felt the power of his Holy Emperor energy reserve surge. However, it felt as if the main force had already been spent and was about to weaken.</p><p>“There’s no time…”</p><p>He knew that he did not have much time left.</p><p>If he couldn’t destroy all of Dao Qiongcang’s trump cards, leave this person here, and kill Rao Yaoyao on Abyss Island at the same time, the tables would have turned. Now he, Xu Xiaoshou, was as mighty as could be but would be as humble in the future.</p><p>In fact, even if he apologized and knelt down, Cutie Rao and Dao Qiongcang would never forgive him.</p><p>“Phew!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou exhaled deeply as his eyes burned with the flames of war.</p><p>“Then let’s fight!”</p><p>“Today, it’s either the two of you would kneel and admit defeat, or I, Xu</p><p>Xiaoshou… Uh, would join the Holy Divine Palace?”</p><p>However, he had insulted them and even beat them up.</p><p>Would Dao Qiongcang still be that magnanimous to allow him to join the Holy Divine Palace at any time and not make things difficult for him?</p><p>These useless thoughts quickly stopped, and Xu Xiaoshou banished them completely.</p><p>He raised his head and roared. His body shrunk and turned into flames as he flashed to both sites at the same time.</p><p>At that time, there was Yan Wuse, Elder Han, Huang Quan, played by Xu</p><p>Xiaoshou – one person for three purposes.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou pursued Dao Qiongcang and Rao Yaoyao and split into two directions. “The speed of light…”</p><p>Everyone was dazzled.</p><p>The figure that was half Xu Xiaoshou as well as half Yan Wuse and their extreme speed stunned everyone completely.</p><p>How could this be Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>This was clearly one of the three Holy Emperors Yan Wuse, who was disguised as Xu Xiaoshou and had the power of a Holy Emperor!</p><p>True Emperor-level strength!</p><p>It was not a nickname!</p><p>“Did he ever have a problem with the adjustment?”</p><p>While everyone was in a daze, Xu Xiaoshou handed over his answer sheet.</p><p>There was!</p><p>But he could endure it!</p><p>“Cutie Rao, I’m here again. Hahaha, you can’t escape from me.”</p><p>Amidst his wild laughter, Xu Xiaoshou caught up with the blood-stained figure.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao didn’t know how to describe her emotions at the moment. She had already cheated death twice and it was all thanks to Dao Qiongcang who saved her.</p><p>Now that Xu Xiaoshou could multitask, who would save her if he chased after Dao Qiongcang?</p><p>He could only save himself!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao gritted her teeth and raised the Cang Godhood Sword to resist while the Golden Fate Dragon protected her body.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang said that he wanted to stall, but who could run away from Xu Xiaoshou’s pursuit? Who could still delay it?</p><p>“King…”</p><p>“What about the king? Cutie Rao! Take this!”</p><p>The sword moved, and a black fist the size of a sandbag suddenly appeared in front of her face.</p><p>This kind of speed… Rao Yaoyao was shocked and blocked it with her sword.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou’s sudden appearance caught her off guard. At that time, she couldn’t even open up the World of Mortals.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>He finally felt the sensation of his fist hitting a hard object.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou watched as the Cang Godhood Sword suddenly caved in. Rao Yaoyao’s arm broke and was shattered by him.</p><p>As one of the Five Great Divine Instruments of Chaos, the divine sword Xuan Cang could withstand the power of his punch and would not break.</p><p>However, the curved sword body that was dented and wrapped around her fist, smashed heavily onto Rao Yaoyao’s chest.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>The Golden Fate Dragon exploded.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, it had absorbed up to 70 – 80% of Xu Xiaoshou’s punch.</p><p>Even so, the power of the remaining Holy Emperor’s power was not something the ancient swordsman with weak defenses could withstand.</p><p>With a ‘pu’ sound, Rao Yaoyao spat out a mouthful of blood. Her body was sent flying, and her pretty face was filled with shock.</p><p>The only defensive item on her body was the blood-stained crystal diamond chain that suddenly flashed out from her waist.</p><p>At this moment, the chain on her waist exploded and turned into a halo that protected her delicate body and prevented it from falling apart.</p><p>However, the huge impact of the punch had already thrown Rao Yaoyao into a state of confusion. Her eyes rolled back.</p><p>All her ribs had been smashed!</p><p>Her waist split open!</p><p>When she regained her senses, Rao Yaoyao could tell that her body was in a</p><p>terrible state.</p><p>As a swordsman, her sword had been sent flying. How humiliating was that?</p><p>However, there was a sound in her ears.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, whose black hair flowed behind him, leaned over.</p><p>A pair of black hands grabbed hold of Rao Yaoyao’s neck, who had almost lost control of her body. With an emotionless expression, he whispered into her ear.</p><p>“Don’t say that I didn’t give you a chance, Cutie Rao. Hand over the semi-saint person and I’ll spare your life.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao could feel the power of the Holy Emperor that surged wildly into her body as it circulated in her bones and veins like a ferocious beast. It was exactly the same as the circulation route of her spiritual source when Water Ghost forced her semi-saint person out of her body!</p><p>“Oh…”</p><p>With a muffled grunt, the semi-saint person almost jumped out of Rao Yaoyao’s head, but she forced herself to endure it. “Xu Xiaoshou, don’t even think about it!”</p><p>At this time, she had no extra treasures left?</p><p>It seems that my cheap senior sister had no backup plan left?</p><p>When he thought about the waist chain, Xu Xiaoshou could not help but look down at her slender waist.</p><p>But who was Rao Yaoyao?</p><p>It was impossible for her to only have the belt on her, unless…</p><p>Combined with Rao Yaoyao’s character, Xu Xiaoshou came to this conclusion..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
