Holy Emperors Emerge! (3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio     Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Zhao Xidong’s mouth opened wide, but he lacked the strength to comment.</p><p>Before he could speak, Elder Qiao nodded in agreement, speaking with a serious tone, “Most likely. After all, Elder Sang has been secretly planning something all this time. He even deceived us!”</p><p>Zhao Xidong fell silent.</p><p>During this period, he had been groomed as the successor, receiving a lot of exaggerated information, but none of it added up to the shock of this moment.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was eager to give it a go, floating even higher. “I think it’s best not to, but I want to see what’s inside the White Cave.”</p><p>The eyes of the three on the side simultaneously lit up. Zhao Xidong asked, “Can you see it?”</p><p>“Ye Xiaotian, curiosity kills the cat!” Xiao Qixiu solemnly warned, though his eyes betrayed a flicker of excitement.</p><p>“Absolutely not!” Qiao Qianzhi shook his head, but his gaze remained fixed on the spatial mirror.</p><p>Zhao Xidong looked at the three insincere expressions and knew they all wanted to see.</p><p>With a swish, the three simultaneously turned their gaze to him, and in unison, they asked, “What do you think?”</p><p>Zhao Xidong gulped and hesitated, “Not looking will leave us unsatisfied, right?”</p><p>“Then as you wish.”</p><p>As if afraid Zhao Xidong would change his mind, Ye Xiaotian activated the spatial mirror and cut into the rifts of the extradimensional space.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The world collapsed, and waves of energy rolled.</p><p>Time and again, the spatial mirror distorted, but Ye Xiaotian, with the Spatial Upanishad, managed to stabilize it.</p><p>White Cave…</p><p>No! It should have been referred to as the Seven Breaks Infernal Hell Sea, and within its depths, under the sweeping influence of the Holy Emperor’s aura, everything appeared extremely chaotic.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian began searching for the source of the Holy Emperor’s power and saw a place that looked “familiar” to what the disciples in the palace had described.</p><p>“This is the Spirit Fusion Swamp that Zhou Tianshen mentioned.”</p><p>“There’s also the aura of a sword. Is this the birthplace of Xu Xiaoshou’s famed sword, Flame Python?”</p><p>“This should be the Lijian Grassland. Old Xiao, can you feel the power of the</p><p>Fourth Sword?”</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>The spatial mirror shifted, revealing a rift in an extradimensional space far from the Lijian Grassland.</p><p>Zhao Xidong was dumbfounded.</p><p>A rift in extradimensional space within another extradimensional space?</p><p>Where did this lead to?</p><p>Before his thoughts could settle, a terrifying force surged out of the black rift.</p><p>Everyone realized the danger and, just as they were about to avert their gaze, it was too late!</p><p>“Pfft—</p><p>White flames spewed forth.</p><p>Starting as a mere flicker, it swiftly evolved into an expansive sea of flames, instantly enveloping thousands of miles.</p><p>Above the sea of flames, a wretched saint with a blurry face stepped out, wearing prison clothes, with shackles on hands and feet, and exuding infernal aura.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>Almost simultaneously, the phantom of seven blood-red ancient trees enlarged infinitely behind him.</p><p>In an instant, they grew from tiny tree shadows to colossal ancient trees, becoming incredibly solid from illusions.</p><p>The blood tree’s canopy was exceptionally lush, and the trunk flowed with crimson. Skeletal remains hung from the branches, giving an eerie vibe.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>With no interval, a square-shaped blue stone flew out behind the seven blood</p><p>trees.</p><p>In a blink, the stone grew larger, turning into an ancient prison that covered the sky and almost filled the entire Infernal Hell Sea.</p><p>The prison was extremely dark, with cell after cell nestled side by side.</p><p>Countless eerie howls emanated from within, affecting the minds of those who heard them. Their Dao hearts became unstable, and they could easily fall into cultivation deviation.</p><p>Zhao Xidong only took a glance, and his body was blasted backward.</p><p>White flames ignited on him, and his mental strength was completely out of control due to the influence of the blood trees. His foundational roots were on the verge of collapsing under the threat of cultivation deviation.</p><p>Similar to him, three others were also blasted away.</p><p>Ye, Qiao, and Xiao were simultaneously thrown back, and the spatial mirror shattered instantly.</p><p>“Zhao Xidong! How could you give such a reckless suggestion?” Xiao Qixiu instinctively scolded his junior brother. They tacitly agreed that Zhao Xidong would take the blame.</p><p>“Stop scolding and save him first. It seems like he can’t make it.” Elder Qiao’s jade pendant shattered. He regained his senses faster than even Ye Xiaotian, and he immediately rushed towards Zhao Xidong.</p><p>“I told you not to look…” Ye Xiaotian supported his head, feeling dizzy. Seeing the two rushing to rescue Zhao Xidong, he felt relieved.</p><p>Three Holy Emperors!</p><p>This was too frightening!</p><p>Did something major happen on Abyss Island?</p><p>Ye Xiaotian contemplated over and over, wiped away the blood from the corner of his mouth, recreated the spatial mirror, and again looked at the black rift inside the White Cave by himself.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>A euphoric and deafening dragon roar reverberated, and a twisting black dragon with five claws emerged. Its ferocious and gigantic dragon head directly collided with the spatial mirror that was peeking into it, instantly enlarging.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I’m here to take you back!”</p><p>This scene was too shocking!</p><p>With a bang, Ye Xiaotian was thrown backward by the sound and impact. Blood spurted from his seven orifices. He tried to lift his trembling hand but failed.</p><p>“Save…”</p><p>“Ugh, save me first…”</p><p>“Damn it, Xu Xiaoshou. It’s really you….”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
