(1)</h1><p>Chapter 2125: How Dare You Provoke Me? Disrespecting Invincible? (1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio     Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Rao Yaoyao felt as if she was in a nightmare.</p><p>The self-destruction of the semi-saint Divine Oracle didn’t hurt her at all because of the Life Guard Emblem.</p><p>However, the two God’s Blessing almost ruined her Saint path!</p><p>It was because she trusted Yu Lingdi, the man who lured her with false intentions, so much that she readily imbibed the poison!</p><p>After she recovered from the cracks inflicted by the red-hot Dark Iron Sword, Rao Yaoyao had intended to sort out her emotions and fight again on Abyss Island.</p><p>Elder Yan had passed away, and she was the only one who could be relied on from the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>Who would have thought that the power of the secondary plane door would suddenly erupt in his body?</p><p>She, Rao Yaoyao, was a dignified demi-saint. She hadn’t even met the higher void Water Ghost personally yet, but she had been captured by him effortlessly and controlled until now…</p><p>If not for Dao Qiongcang, she would have almost lost her semi-saint person.</p><p>How could she defend herself against this?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had poor hindsight, so she had no way to guard against the Black Hand Water Ghost who had pretended to be Yu Lingdi.</p><p>Even though she was unwilling to admit it, she had tried to make a guess.</p><p>If she could turn back time, she would still consume those two Elixirs…</p><p>That was because that Yu Lingdi at that time was so sincere. He was so eloquent and had said even though it was the last God’s Blessing, he was still willing to give it away.</p><p>Who could refuse?</p><p>It was offered so sincerely!</p><p>Which woman in this world could refuse?</p><p>At that time, Rao Yaoyao even secretly tucked away the favor that her younger brother Yu Lingdi had done for her in her memory. She vowed that she would repay it in the future.</p><p>After that, the secondary plane door in Elder Yan’s hands went out of control in and failed to protect him. Yu Lingdi rushed up to question him like a madman.</p><p>Under the spatial crack, the situation outside could not be seen clearly.</p><p>However, Yu Lingdi had called out the Saint’s name. “You killed my Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao heard it from afar and saw the shocking scene.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s veins bulged. He charged at demi-saint Yan Wuse even though he was only at the Cutting Path Level, just to avenge her.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s heart trembled and she was instantly moved.</p><p>She really thought that this younger brother, Yu Lingdi, had fallen in love with her.</p><p>She really thought that Yan Wuse, the light of spiritual cultivation was the traitor of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>Who would have thought otherwise!</p><p>Then the situation changed. Yu Lingdi took out the golden beast mask, beheaded Elder Yan, and then turned around to suppress her. He tried to grab her semi-saint person in the same manner one pried open a clam to reach the pearl…</p><p>What was ‘humiliation’?</p><p>When the power of the secondary plane door appeared in his body and she saw Yu Lingdi’s true appearance.</p><p>At that moment, Rao Yaoyao broke down.</p><p>She was the classic clown. She, Rao Yaoyao, had been played by Water Ghost from the beginning to the end.</p><p>Even Derore sne Cliea, sne still tnougnt tnat water Gnost was a gooa person ana she hated Elder Yan.</p><p>This was a total humiliation!</p><p>Fortunately, when she woke up from this dream, the worst outcome had not happened.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s semi-saint person had not been taken away. She had only suffered some bodily injuries.</p><p>When Water Ghost chose to transcend the tribulation and could not control her, Dao Qiongcang took care of her and she recovered to a certain extent. No one coveted the semi-saint person now. It returned to her body and her power came back.</p><p>All that was left in Rao Yaoyao’s mind was to avenge her humiliation!</p><p>The old saying that ‘It was never too late for a gentleman to take revenge even if it took ten years’ did not apply in this case. Rao Yaoyao wasn’t a gentleman. She couldn’t let the night go by after she suffered such humiliation!</p><p>When she thought about how Water Ghost had successfully impersonated Yu Lingdi and tricked her, she was so angry that her delicate body trembled.</p><p>Therefore, when she woke up from her dream and sensed that the power on the battlefield was out of balance and that something was wrong, Rao Yaoyao rushed in without hesitation.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was present!</p><p>The situation wasn’t right, but she didn’t need to think about it anymore. She just needed to wield the sword well.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang would clean up the remaining mess.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>When the sword hummed, plum blossoms fell from the Fallen Abyss, and the illusion showed the battle situation in the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>In the next second, the Space-Time Transition appeared. As reality and illusion changed, Rao Yaoyao stepped onto the battlefield with her sword.</p><p>“Water Ghost, today is the day you die!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao, who was clad in a ragged dress splattered with blood and held a sword with one arm, gritted her teeth as she entered the arena.</p><p>The most shocking thing she saw was not the bombardment of the supreme saint calamity or Water Ghost’s strange aura that emerged from Dao Qiongcang’s body.</p><p>Instead, it was the person who stepped on a sea of white flames with the Swallow the Mountains and Rivers. He looked like a flame Lord who had descended to this world.</p><p>“You are…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao paused for a moment and racked her brains to match this figure with a certain someone in her memory.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>At this point, she was stunned.</p><p>Had her dream lasted for a thousand years?</p><p>Water Ghost turned into Dao Qiongcang?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already reached the Holy Emperor State?</p><p>What had happened in this world when she lost control?</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao, calm down.” Dao Qiongcang’s voice drifted out from his body.</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao, I didn’t expect you to survive your ordeal. However, I’m currently in the state of a ghost beast host body, and Xu Xiaoshou had completely transformed into a ghost beast. With your abilities, can you fight against the two of them?” Suddenly Water Ghost’s voice drifted out from Dao Qiongcang’s body as he used the crudest provocation technique.</p><p>This might seem aimless to outsiders, but Water Ghost had studied Rao Yaoyao very well.</p><p>He didn’t need to use any brilliant techniques. Rao Yaoyao would naturally figure it out.</p><p>“Ghost beast…”</p><p>Rao Yao’s expression changed.</p><p>The Inner Island had already been broken into once?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang couldn’t withstand Water Ghost’s sneak attack?</p><p>It did not make sense!</p><p>Stop!</p><p>With Dao Qiongcang around, she did not need to think and only needed to follow his arrangements.</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao, calm down. Xu Xiaoshou can borrow someone else’s power only for a short period of time. There will be an end to it. You don’t have to listen to Water Ghost’s nonsense. You just have to wait until Xu Xiaoshou has spent all the power.” Dao Qiongcang spoke again.</p><p>He was happy that Rao Yaoyao had appeared..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
