Even Hallmaster Dao wouldn’t dare to say so confidently. If Aje wakes up again, he’ll be a demi-saint, even stronger than you,” Qiao Qianzhi remarked nonchalantly, biting into a piece of goose leg, his eyes shining.</p><p>“Now, not only are we creating life, but we’re also crafting saints!” Ye Xiaotian fell into silence.</p><p>Xiao Qixiu remained silent on the side, calmly sipping his tea.</p><p>Only Zhao Xidong, wearing an expression of someone enjoying a show, took a sip of his wine, suppressing a laugh, thinking how absurd these old folks were.</p><p>Divine Puppet…</p><p>Creating life, crafting saints…</p><p>All the discussion about a demi-saint person: Could sanctification be achieved as long as it fits? Could this also be implanted into Aje to grant him power?</p><p>Would you look at that?</p><p>Could they listen to themselves?</p><p>What kind of talk was this?</p><p>Divine Secret was the sophisticated playthings of Hallmaster Dao!</p><p>Elder Qiao’s proficiency in the spiritual array might have been high, but how audacious of him to act like he knew more than Hallmaster Dao?</p><p>“I can’t believe these old folks are even more outrageous than Xu Xiaoshou…” Zhao Xidong’s lips moved a few times, but he dared not laugh out loud.</p><p>Without warning, the thatched house shook, as if the Tiansang Spirit Palace was experiencing an earthquake.</p><p>The old folks reacted swiftly, immediately rising from the wooden table.</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi quickly collected everything on the table, including Aje, while the demi-saint person was entrusted to Ye Xiaotian.</p><p>Xiao Qixiu shot a sidelong glance.</p><p>“What’s that sound?”</p><p>Zhao Xidong murmured as he stood up, pushing open the door. Raising his eyes, he saw dark clouds gathering in the distant sky.</p><p>The day was rapidly transitioning into dusk.</p><p>Not only the surroundings of the thatched house but the entire Tiansang Spirit Palace, including Tiansang City, Tiansang Prefecture, and nearby counties and cities, became oppressively heavy.</p><p>Distant and faint, but undoubtedly, immense black rifts appeared in the sky, as if the heavens were tearing apart, creating a spectacular scene.</p><p>Zhao Xidong could not believe his eyes. What kind of phenomenon was this?</p><p>Looking in that direction, at those black rifts… Zhao Xidong recognized a familiar sensation from his memory.</p><p>“White Cave, extradimensional space rift?”</p><p>“Boss Xiao, something doesn’t seem right. Are ghosts, ghost beasts coming out again, like a few years ago?”</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>An intangible, grand, and ancient wave of energy gently swept over the nearby counties and cities around the White Cave.</p><p>The Tiansang Spirit Palace shook again.</p><p>This time, even the protective barriers were triggered by the force.</p><p>“I…” Zhao Xidong’s knees went weak, almost kneeling.</p><p>He struggled, propping himself up on Boss Xiao’s timely extended arm, his face still showing traces of horror. “From this distance, just a breath, and I can’t bear it… Is this the power of a demi-saint?”</p><p>The old folks who came out of the thatched house fell into silence.</p><p>Soon, Xiao Qixiu raised his eyes slightly, silently watching the spatial crack in the distance, and spoke with awe:</p><p>“Holy Emperor! ”</p><p>Huh?</p><p>Zhao Xidong looked back with an incredulous expression, seeing the uniformly astonished looks on the faces of the three old folks.</p><p>He wanted to say, “Boss Xiao, are you joking? Till this point, have you ever seen a Holy Emperor?”</p><p>However, the genuine expressions of these three conveyed, “We have indeed seen a Holy Emperor!”</p><p>“Better not look, you guys,” Ye Xiaotian said, wiping his hand through the air, revealing a spatial mirror.</p><p>The others cast a collective sidelong glance.</p><p>How could they not look?</p><p>Zhao Xidong could not suppress his curiosity. With a single glance, he saw the remnants of the Eighth Palace battlefield on the spatial mirror.</p><p>There were still traces of the battle between Bazhun’an and Gou Wuyue, attracting countless swordsmen from the Eastern Region.</p><p>At this moment, there were still figures on the ground in the spatial mirror… in ruins.</p><p>“They got too close and were crushed by that aura?”</p><p>Zhao Xidong marveled while feeling grateful that Ye Xiaotian, the former dean, had indeed become more powerful, able to observe the Tiansang Prefecture from within the Spirit Palace.</p><p>The image on the spatial mirror abruptly changed from the Eighth Palace to the extradimensional space rift in the sky.</p><p>“It’s the reopening of the White Cave!”</p><p>“Wait, why are there so many white flames flowing out? Something seems off with the aura of White Cave.’</p><p>Confused, Zhao Xidong looked at Boss Xiao. Didn’t these white flames resemble Xu Xiaoshou’s abilities?</p><p>Something was weird!</p><p>Very weird!</p><p>Upon revisiting the details, not only Xu Xiaoshou but Elder Sang, as a Sleeveless Saint Servant, also seemed off.</p><p>The knowledge and abilities of the three remaining elders in the Spirit Palace, setting aside other aspects, seemed strangely out of place—particularly the unparalleled Spatial Upanishad originating from their very own Spirit Palace.</p><p>It was as if they were all hidden bosses, and he was just an ignorant young man… Zhao Xidong became even more confused.</p><p>Still stunned, Xiao Qixiu squinted, offering no response.</p><p>Elder Qiao immediately saw that the extradimensional space had ascended in rank and explained:</p><p>“It’s no longer the White Cave…”</p><p>“I’ve heard that there were the Fourth Sword, the Cardinal Wheel, and even the source seed of the word that suppressed the White Cave. They were all lost when the White Cave opened.”</p><p>“So, it’s clear that with this liberation, this extradimensional space is likely to be reverted to the Infernal Hell Sea.</p><p>Infernal Hell Sea?</p><p>Zhao Xidong paused, recalling what this meant and almost could not catch his breath.</p><p>Wasn’t this one of the Seven Breaks, which basically would not appear in the same place again once opened?</p><p>Elder Qiao, what exactly was he talking about…</p><p>“I guess it’s related to Xu Xiaoshou,” Xiao Qixiu said, shocking everyone with his unexpected statement, attributing everything to Xu Xiaoshou..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
