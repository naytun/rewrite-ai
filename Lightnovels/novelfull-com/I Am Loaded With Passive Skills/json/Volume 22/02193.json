(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Wu Rao Emperor Realm, it had beautiful mountains, rivers and outstanding talent.</p><p>In this realm, it was not possible to see the ground, but you could sit beside the clouds. This world did not consist of any yin and yang, and was a quiet place.</p><p>The wind blew the clouds along and the mountains rose amid green hues. There was a rainbow bridge across the sky, and one could hear the ethereal cries of cranes.</p><p>There weren’t many records of this fairyland in the clouds in the ancient book of the outside world. There was only a brief summary:</p><p>“The ancients cherished the elements, but now they don’t care about the ancients. To rely on the mountains is akin to reliance on the rain, I can see the ancient times.”</p><p>Within the clouds and fog, everything was very mysterious.</p><p>This was the world’s impression of the Wu Rao Emperor Realm.</p><p>It was said that once one entered this world, one could feel the densest spiritual energy in the world. From time to time, there would be ownerless Holy Power that floated past and cleansed the soul.</p><p>If one observed the spiritual rain in this realm, one could often enter the realm of Enlightenment, catch a glimpse of the ancient power, steal a little of the wind power, and greatly improve their cultivation level.</p><p>Now, in this fairyland in the clouds, the breeze became more sorrowful and the air more desolate.</p><p>Even the flowing clouds that brushed past the green peaks seemed to be crying, as if they mourned for someone and empathized with the world.</p><p>“Woo…”</p><p>In the Wu Rao Emperor Realm, in the Eight Directions Mountain, a mournful sound in the Saint Language suddenly came from the Eight Directions Divine Court and resounded throughout the entire world.</p><p>Everyone who heard this felt sad, but they also realized that this strange phenomenon was caused by the death of a demi-saint from the Holy Emperor Rao bloodline.</p><p>But…</p><p>If a demi-saint from the Rao Clan were to walk outside, who in the world would dare to kill him?</p><p>For a moment, the people from the Wu Rao Emperor Realm felt anxious and furious. They felt as if a storm was about to erupt.</p><p>On the Eight Directions Mountain, a person exited from the secluded forest and entered a small path.</p><p>It was an extraordinarily handsome man dressed in a green robe. His chest was exposed and he used only a blue jade belt to fasten his clothes at the abdomen and revealed an expanse of jade-like skin and flesh. His precious Saint body glowed brightly and he looked extremely divine.</p><p>He listened attentively for a while and instantly the sadness in his heart disappeared. He raised his eyebrows slightly and smiled.</p><p>“I’m sorry. I might have come at the wrong time in the midst of this tragic.. occurrence within your clan?”</p><p>His expression was extremely relaxed, as if he was out for a stroll in his own courtyard. In his hand, he twirled a green branch that he seemed to have broken off from nowhere. He casually swished it in the air and it made a Chi Chi sound.</p><p>With every move, the path energy swirled about on the handsome man’s body. His Holy Power circulated about and he had an indescribable special charm.</p><p>“Lord Yue Gongli, my apologies. I didn’t know that something like this would happen today. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have invited you to climb the mountain today.” The person beside him lowered his head and said, but there were still traces of shock in his eyes.</p><p>He was from the Rao Clan and was responsible for receiving visitors from the other four Holy Emperor secret realms.</p><p>Rao Buku had been outside for many years so he naturally understood what that Saint Fall’s cry represented.</p><p>As far as he knew, the only Rao family wayfarer in the Shengshen Continent, other than the outsider who had been removed from the Rao family, was Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was a heaven-sent talent, the Ruler of the red-robed people and was the Seven Sword Deity.</p><p>Previously, the sword cries of sanctification had sounded from the Eight Directions Divine Court. This meant that Rao Yaoyao had become a sword saint.</p><p>With such strength that accompanied her and the surname Rao, what kind of major event had happened in the outside world for Rao Yaoyao to suffer the Saint Fall?</p><p>“My guess was right. The one who died was Rao Yaoyao, right? That lady’s talent was extraordinary. What a pity…”</p><p>The man called Yue Gongli rolled his eyes and thought of something. He asked curiously, “Rao Buku, Wangze Holy Emperor wouldn’t have allowed anything to happen to Rao Yaoyao. Tell me honestly, why did she fall?”</p><p>On the bluestone path that led to the Eight Directions Divine Court, Rao Buku stopped. His eyes were still lowered and his expression remained unchanged. He was well aware of the ill-intentioned probing of the person from the Yue</p><p>Clan.</p><p>He laughed and shook his head.</p><p>“I am also extremely saddened by this Saint Fall.”</p><p>“But accidents would always happen. Rao Yaoyao had traveled outside and there are experts who are more talented than her, so the risks are even greater.”</p><p>“Wangze Holy Emperor would not be able to keep an eye on her forever. Many people like the Ten High Nobles back then had the courage and strength to kill a Saint.”</p><p>Yue Gongli burst into laughter. His laughter traveled far and wide on the bluestone path. Some of the Rao clansmen who were not far away frowned and looked displeased.</p><p>This was a Saint Fall. Who would be so unrestrained as to laugh out loud outside the Eight Directions Divine Court?</p><p>Finally, Yue Gongli felt satisfied and stopped his laughter. He smirked and said, “Rao Yaoyao should have… Cough cough, let’s not talk about this.”</p><p>He changed the topic. “It can’t have been like that, right? Rao Buku, you don’t have to lie to me. Wangze Holy Emperor must have made a move!”</p><p>“Wangze Holy Emperor had been in seclusion all year round. It’s not up to us juniors to guess if he would make a move.” Rao Buku’s expression did not change.</p><p>“No! Abyss Island had descended, and all the five Holy Emperor secret realms paid close attention… Rao Buku, you can’t lie to me. Wangze Holy Emperor’s thought incarnation must have already reached Abyss Island! ”</p><p>“What? Is that so?” Rao Buku, who was a middle-aged man with graying hair, raised his head in surprise.</p><p>“You sure know how to pretend.” Yue Gongli shook his head with a smile. There was a hint of surprise in his voice. “That’s amazing. Even Wangze Holy Emperor failed. Rao Yaoyao was still killed… Did this mean that he had been seriously injured in this battle and was unable to protect Rao Yaoyao’s life and ensure her safety? Uh, it’s thought-provoking…”</p><p>“Lord Yue Gongli, you must not make guesses about the intentions of the Holy Emperor!” Rao Buku’s facial features trembled in unease.</p><p>“Look, I didn’t get punished even though I spoke in this manner.” The handsome man spread his hands and smiled. His eyes suddenly turned crafty and he said, “Then, does this mean that I can take advantage of the situation….”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
