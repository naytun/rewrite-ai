He took a step forward and flashed onto the Sky Sword.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was still in a half-empty state.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou had never cultivated the sword, he might not have been able to find a turning point.</p><p>However, he was a disciple of Mei Siren and had already seen through the Nine Major Sword Techniques. Why would he worry about not having a way to break them?</p><p>“Three Streams of Red Plum Blossoms, Falling Flower World.”</p><p>When the dark red fell, the real was replaced by the illusion. Rao Yaoyao’s sword hadn’t even struck down when her Sky Sword turned from real to illusion.</p><p>Her figure moved from half-hidden to the front of the stage.</p><p>Under Xu Xiaoshou’s powerful spiritual sense, even without the need to switch between reality and illusion, he could feel Rao Yaoyao’s anger and killing intent within the thoughts floating in the spiritual world.</p><p>“Three Streams of Red Plum Blossoms, Qingshi Sword!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou formed a sword with a thought and pulled the Flame Python.</p><p>The giant green sword, which was also floating in the air, pierced through the space in an instant and met Rao Yaoyao’s Sky Sword.</p><p>Under everyone’s shocked gaze, Sword Saint Rao Yaoyao and “Holy Emperor” Xu Xiaoshou had just cast their spells when the two ancient giant swords collided in the sky.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The airwaves surged in the sky, breaking through the void.</p><p>The saint calamity instantly lost its color, and Dao Qiong Cang’s divine Sinan guided it.</p><p>While transcending the tribulation, he did not forget to order Si Wuzhen to cast a faint light to protect the group of people watching the battle below.</p><p>The Holy Divine Palace was a faction of light, so it was impossible for them to just let a Saint war kill these people.</p><p>“Too fierce!”</p><p>“Although Xu Xiaoshou has the ability of a Holy Emperor, and he has teased Fairy Rao several times before…”</p><p>“I still don’t think he has the ability to win the draw. What do you think?” With their lives guaranteed, someone spoke in shock.</p><p>However, very few people followed. Saint wars were rare, and a Saint War between ancient sword cultivators was even rarer and unheard of!</p><p>Everyone raised their heads and watched the fight without saying anything. They only cared about gaining experience.</p><p>The moment the Sky Sword and the Qingshi Sword collided, Rao Yaoyao’s delicate body shook violently. She vomited blood and almost spat it out. However, Xu Xiaoshou was in an even more unbearable state.</p><p>The white flames under his feet were instantly shattered, and the flaming wings on his back shattered on the spot.</p><p>The Qingshi Sword managed to block the attack, but his body could not withstand the sword saint’s strike or the backlash from using the power of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>He was constantly resisting the torture of the Holy Emperor’s power, so he wasn’t at his peak.</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>A mouthful of white lava spurted out. It was actually blood, but it was all energy.</p><p>While Xu Xiaoshou controlled the Qingshi Sword to not change its shape, he retreated and immediately realized.</p><p>He was definitely not Rao Yaoyao’s match when it came to a sword fight!</p><p>He was now a Holy Emperor Spiritual Cultivator with the Ember Heart and the Three Day Frozen Calamity, so why was he losing?</p><p>“Heart Sword Technique, World of Mortals!”</p><p>As these thoughts flashed through his mind, Rao Yaoyao had already changed her moves. Her brows narrowed and then raised.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he had been struck by lightning. His mind was in the world of mortals. He saw the dust of the army and the waves of swords. In just a moment, he woke up with the protection of his Holy Emperor’s power.</p><p>However, it was delayed for just a moment!</p><p>The Qingshi Sword was broken with a loud bang. Rao Yaoyao came face to face with the momentum. Xuan Cang commanded the Sky Sword to move as if it wanted to split him into two.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, pay the price for your shameless boasting!” Rao Yaoyao’s eyes were cold as she shouted.</p><p>He forced her to use…</p><p>“Emperor Pattern Seed Technique!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed softly and entered the state of an Acalanätha.</p><p>However, source seeds of the Ember Realm instantly appeared around him. They were condensed from the power of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>They didn’t seek stability but sought to explode.</p><p>The fire seeds were densely packed and wrapped around Xu Xiaoshou’s body, airtight.</p><p>Explosions were the best defense!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao slashed down with her sword. At the critical moment, she forcefully restrained her sword and almost hit those source seeds.</p><p>“What are these?”</p><p>Her heart was pounding as she pierced Xu Xiaoshou with her Space-Time</p><p>Transition sword, not daring to hurt the source seeds around him anymore.</p><p>However, with this momentary delay, Xu Xiaoshou recovered from the Acalanätha.</p><p>“The Heart Sword Technique, the Demons Under Eyes!”</p><p>With a loud bang, Rao Yaoyao was hit by the same move. Surging demonic energy surged out of her body.</p><p>However, this was not the first time she had been hit by this move. She quickly woke up.</p><p>However, a moment later, the scene had changed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou slashed down with the Flame Python in his right hand, pulling the tens of thousands of Holy Emperor source seeds as if he wanted to destroy the world.</p><p>This wasn’t the end. His left hand, Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand, stretched out and grabbed the illusion with the reality. He seized the opportunity when Rao Yaoyao lost control and grabbed her neck.</p><p>“Buzz…”</p><p>A sharp pain assaulted her. At this moment, Rao Yaoyao could even smell burnt flesh, but she didn’t have the time to be alarmed.</p><p>This was because the Flame Python brought thousands of Source Seeds with it as it slashed down like the Grim Reaper.</p><p>“Under the reign of the Holy Emperor, doesn’t everything else seem</p><p>insignificant?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
