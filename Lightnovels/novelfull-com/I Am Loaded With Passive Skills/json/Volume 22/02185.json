(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>She realized that she was no longer a higher void and could no longer just sit back and enjoy the outcome of every major event that had taken place. In the past, there would always be a demi-saint or a Holy Emperor who would deal with the aftermath.</p><p>No one could help her deal with the aftermath of the current situation!</p><p>Even Dao Qiongcang stopped all his activities with the divine Sinan. It was as if he felt lost because Xu Xiaoshou had interrupted all his plans.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the ruins of the First Hall of Sins and his bloodshot eyes resembled those of a rabid dog.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang!”</p><p>These three words that were roared aloud indicated who the next target would be after Xu Xiaoshou sealed up Wangze Holy Emperor. This made Rao Yaoyao realize that her mission had arrived.</p><p>Protect!</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao, retreat. Don’t worry about me.”</p><p>“Use all your strength to pry open a crack on Abyss Island and make your escape.”</p><p>“Remember what I told you before. You are an ancient swordsman. Don’t be a sentimental swordsman and be restricted to one sword technique.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang held the divine Sinan in his hand and maintained a calm expression as he sent a telepathic communication to Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>Of course, he knew why Wangze Holy Emperor had called out before he died.</p><p>When he sacrificed the Holy Emperor and used the Divine Secret, it would allow him to control this power and regain control of the Si Wu Formation.</p><p>If he used the Si Wu Formation, apart from the removal of the power of the Four Holy Emperors from Xiaoshou, he could at least break the seal. Then he could open one of the Four Image gates on Abyss Island and allow the party from the Holy Divine Palace to escape.</p><p>However, Wangze Holy Emperor had been too ambitious!</p><p>Even when he was sealed by the power of the Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison, he still underestimated Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had never thought that this idea could be realized, so he only held the divine Sinan and didn’t take any action from the start to the end.</p><p>As an outsider, he could see that Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have lost his mind because of his power, but in fact, everything was done in an orderly manner.</p><p>With his talent and temperament, he would be able to withstand at least the fifth level under the Seven Tree Emperor’s seven-fold power of guidance.</p><p>In other words, he could execute all the actions like hunger, thirst, obsession, slaughter, and death.</p><p>Still under the Guidance, according to Xu Xiaoshou’s own plan, he would carry out the large-scale death of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>As for the power of guidance thereafter, Dao Qiongcang was well aware that Xu Xiaoshou didn’t have that much time.</p><p>Before Xu Xiaoshou completely lost control, Bazhun’an would withdraw the power of the four Holy Emperors from the Four Divine Pillars. At least, this would allow Xu Xiaoshou some breathing space.</p><p>As for that fellow, according to the information, he only needed one breath to recover.</p><p>In short, Dao Qiongcang had already predicted that he would not be able to overturn the game and he had never thought he would do it.</p><p>However, he didn’t expect that even though Wangze Holy Emperor had</p><p>appeared, this variable was not able to change the situation.</p><p>Although the development of the situation was within expectations, the result was too unsatisfactory!</p><p>“I’m leaving. What about you?” Rao Yaoyao raised her sword. Not only did she not have any intention to retreat, but her eyes glowed with the fervor of war.</p><p>“I won’t die!” Dao Qiongcang glared at her.</p><p>He wasn’t Yan Wuse. He wouldn’t really die on Abyss Island.</p><p>However, Rao Yaoyao was different. She had just undergone sanctification and hadn’t even had the time to refine her demi-saint incarnation.</p><p>If they were to be killed on Abyss Island, they would not even be able to enter the reincarnation realm under the power of the four Holy Emperors. Their bodies and souls would be destroyed.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao held her sword and didn’t speak.</p><p>From the moment she asked Dao Qiongcang those questions, she had already made up her mind.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang could read the thoughts of the people around him with just a glance and was almost angered. However, he calmly reeled off a few names.</p><p>“Bazhun’an, Hua Changdeng, You Tu… Hua Weiyang, Feng Wuhen, Gu</p><p>Louying…And Xu Xiaoshou who borrowed the power of outsiders.”</p><p>“You should think about it.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s expression flickered.</p><p>Indeed, compared to the real peak of the Way of the Sword in her heart, how could she even measure up to this Xu Xiaoshou, who had borrowed external forces?</p><p>However, Dao Qiongcang had clearly said that he wanted her to protect him.</p><p>Was he trying to use these ‘names’ to protect her in a roundabout way while he headed towards his death?</p><p>“If I had allowed you to follow me earlier, wouldn’t you have died?” Dao Qiongcang seemed to have the Mind Reading Technique and his words came as a shock.</p><p>Only then did Rao Yaoyao take a deep breath. She had an enlightenment about the profound meaning behind Dao Qiongcang’s words and turned to leave.</p><p>“Buzz! ”</p><p>She hadn’t moved yet, but there was a surge of energy that came from the distance.</p><p>As Wangze Holy Emperor was devoured, the power of the Wind Gently Carries disappeared, and the Finger of Annihilation that had been in the state of ‘explosion/non-explosion’…</p><p>It was back!</p><p>The surging power could not be ignored because it was no longer in the strange state that led to the ancient wind path.</p><p>“Kaka!”</p><p>The remnants of the Holy Emperor’s power were instantly shattered by the power of the Finger of Annihilation. The mark of the Nine Heavens cracked and a deathly stillness filled the area.</p><p>“Cutie Rao, are you afraid of me?”</p><p>“I haven’t taken back the thing I deposited on you. You want to escape?”</p><p>A maniacal laugh came from the sky, and the sea of fire flashed as Xu Xiaoshou stepped on the air.</p><p>He was so insolent that he directly descended onto Dao Qiongcang and Rao Yaoyao’s heads and ignored them completely.</p><p>After he missed, he didn’t say anything and flung his hands out.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The countless green chains of order wrapped around his arms flew out. That was the power of the Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison.</p><p>It was a similar attack that devoured Wangze Holy Emperor’s remnant will.</p><p>The power of the Four Divine Pillars was still maintained. Even though Xu Xiaoshou had defeated Wangze Holy Emperor, he was already at the end of his tether.</p><p>But he was not an ordinary person.</p><p>Most people would have reverted to their original form by now!</p><p>With the help of the various passive skills on his body and the Holy Blood that had no side effects, Xu Xiaoshou forcefully extended the limit of his attack by a few times..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
