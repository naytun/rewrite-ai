Dao Qiongcang was visibly surprised and could not help but glance back at Rao</p><p>Yaoyao.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s battle consciousness was not to be underestimated!</p><p>Anyone still holding the mindset that he was just a young man who had tapped into the power of the Holy Emperor but was fundamentally inexperienced and would undoubtedly be wiped out.</p><p>He had only one tactic in his fights: crush his opponents with force, then verbally assault them, and after shattering their mental defenses, proceed to kill.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s tactics were undeniably successful.</p><p>As an outsider, Dao Qiongcang saw it clearly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou never underestimated any opponent, yet in the presence of this junior, Wangze Holy Emperor could not help but feel a sense of complacency.</p><p>Smart and confident individuals like Bazhun’an would typically choose to confront their opponents head-on, overpowering them with force.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was different, entirely different!</p><p>He was cunning with a touch of unconventional calculations, outwardly arrogant yet inwardly confident. He would start by breaking the opponent’s defenses with trash talk, then reveal his killer move.</p><p>In Dao Qiongcang’s eyes, there was no clear distinction between the two tactics. He even admired Xu Xiaoshou’s tactics since. After all, they were both dirty players.</p><p>But if a comparison had to be made, it would depend on who the opponent was.</p><p>Without a doubt, Xu Xiaoshou’s tactics against the Rao family were repeatedly successful.</p><p>so…</p><p>Was this a continuation of the same lineage?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have uncovered a weakness of the seemingly invincible</p><p>Holy Emperor Rao.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang could not help but glance at Rao Yaoyao again.</p><p>“What are you looking at?” One look was fine, but two glances were disrespectful. Rao Yaoyao keenly noticed the unusual gaze.</p><p>“Nothing.” Dao Qiongcang shook his head and returned his gaze to the battlefield.</p><p>“You clearly…”</p><p>“Wangze Holy Emperor is in danger.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang interrupted with a single sentence, successfully shifting the topic. Rao Yaoyao could not help but worry as she looked towards the Desolate Inferno Domain, where the battle was about to erupt.</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor emerged from the wind core in a weakened state. He bore not only the severe consequences of Xu Xiaoshou’s earlier strike of the Dragon Melting Realm but also suffered from shattered mental defenses—the result of Xu Xiaoshou’s relentless verbal assault, which was the real breakthrough.</p><p>After revealing his form, Wangze Holy Emperor saw that Xu Xiaoshou’s battle consciousness was on par with his own. This young man, with an apparent age of only around twenty, possessed battle consciousness close to the third realm?</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor felt uneasy.</p><p>He directly blocked out Xu Xiaoshou’s trash talk, no longer willing to listen or get angry.</p><p>The wind core condensed, gathering all the white flame.</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor emerged from the center without a trace of white flame clinging to him.</p><p>However, upon revealing himself, his first move was not to angrily charge forward but to turn around and leave.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>“Rao Wangze, do you think I am so invincible that a few words can scare you away?</p><p>At the top of the solitary tower, Xu Xiaoshou laughed maniacally.</p><p>Despite the words, Xu Xiaoshou, confident in his abilities, was not going to let this opportunity slip through his fingers.</p><p>Rao Wangze suffered both spiritual and physical injuries in this encounter. Xu Xiaoshou had unleashed his most potent Lip Spear, Tongue Sword, and if he let this opportunity slip by, he would not be making the most of his Holy Emperor-level “Agility.”</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Opening his mouth, Xu Xiaoshou roared like a dragon.</p><p>The compressed Dragon Pearl in front of his face instantly cracked, unleashing a torrent of dragon aura.</p><p>The dark and demonic Diabolical Force spread like ink in the Nine Heavens, sweeping through the land and devastating everything in its path. In an instant, it enveloped the spot where the wind had dissipated, preventing Rao Wangze’s futile attempt to escape.</p><p>“The present moment is like the moon, while the ancient times are like the wind….</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor, who had adjusted his mentality in an instant, calmly pointed to the air and invoked the Wind Rites Sutra, saying lightly, “Wind Gently Carries!”</p><p>With a light sound, an intangible Space-Time Gate opened, bringing a distant and cool breeze that swept through the heavens and earth.</p><p>That power exuded an ancient, timeless flavor imbued with vicissitudes, blowing through the Dragon Pearl’s energy, brushing past Wangze Holy Emperor…</p><p>The overwhelmed Wangze Holy Emperor was suddenly separated from the attacking force!</p><p>Though they had been interwoven, at this moment, they were distinctly separated!</p><p>The wind carried away all the Dragon Pearl energy, compressing it into a corner and imprisoning it in the ancient wind.</p><p>Freed from the current situation, Wangze Holy Emperor was able to flee. Not only the onlookers but even Xu Xiaoshou was stunned by this move.</p><p>“The power of time…”</p><p>Undoubtedly, Wangze Holy Emperor’s defensive spiritual technique involved the Great Path of Time.</p><p>This reminded Xu Xiaoshou of the Finger of Annihilation.</p><p>At this moment, that energy was still compressed above the ruins of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>It neither exploded nor dissipated, remaining in a superimposed state.</p><p>That one finger seemed to be trapped in a “world” without the flow of time, only moving within the “Cycle of Wind” from ancient times to the present moment.</p><p>At that time, Xu Xiaoshou could not grasp it, but now he had a better understanding; it was the power of “Wind Gently Carries.”</p><p>Clearly, Wangze Holy Emperor was not a pure wind attribute Spiritual Cultivator.</p><p>Or, one could say that his understanding of the wind attribute had a touch of time.</p><p>Nothing in this world existed independently, including Innate Elemental</p><p>High temperatures could create infernal white flames, and low temperatures could forge the Three Days Frozen Calamity. Xu Xiaoshou had long understood this principle.</p><p>But the wind attribute could also be related to time. Xu Xiaoshou gained a new understanding of the path of Spiritual Cultivation.</p><p>However…</p><p>“Do you think that by doing this, you can escape my pursuit?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind surged with beastly desire, and his lips unconsciously curled up, almost reaching his ears.</p><p>At the same time, the seven phantom blood trees behind him swayed gently..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
