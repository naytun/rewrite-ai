(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>A few times…</p><p>It might be difficult to deal with Wangze Holy Emperor, but it was more than enough to deal with two demi-saints!</p><p>“Deposit?”</p><p>“What deposit?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao constantly paid attention to her own state. She was afraid that, as Dao Qiongcang had said, if her state of mind fluctuated again, she would be affected by the power of guidance of the Seven Trees Emperor.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou’s words still left her puzzled. She did not recall that Xu Xiaoshou had left anything on her.</p><p>There was no time to think!</p><p>The power of the Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison flew over. Rao Yaoyao wanted to stop and counterattack.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang shouted and stepped forward. The divine Sinan spun rapidly in his palm, and it sounded as if it was about to crack.</p><p>“Greater Teleportation Technique!”</p><p>The Celestial Scroll opened up in the sky.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou burst into laughter. “Bodhisattva, are you really a living Bodhisattva? You can’t even protect yourself. How can you take care of others?</p><p>Burn!”</p><p>With a glance, the power of Ember Heart was activated.</p><p>The Celestial Scroll that had just opened up was instantly covered in white flames.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the replica of the Power Upanishad Formation was ignited from the Way of the Heavens, perception, Holy Power and intent; all of these were erased.</p><p>Under the Four Divine Pillars, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even care about Dao Qiongcang, would he even bother about a mere Celestial Scroll?.</p><p>“Dao…” Rao Yaoyao’s eyes were filled with worry and she was about to turn around to help.</p><p>Under the green chains of order, Dao Qiongcang sighed softly and put away the divine Sinan. He then patted it lightly with his left hand.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The green chains that contained the power of the Holy Emperor were all sent flying by his hand, that had suddenly turned crystalline white!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, enough is enough.” Dao Qiongcang’s eyes were filled with anger as he spoke harshly.</p><p>What was this?</p><p>Elder Dao the Flamboyant’s hand managed to forcefully block Xu Xiaoshou’s unrestrained and charging force.</p><p>He could clearly see that Dao Qiongcang’s left arm did not seem to be his own. It was more like a famed sword or a holy weapon…</p><p>In other words, a self-made war Divine Instrument that surpassed the Divine Oracle merely made an appearance in the form of a ‘hand’.</p><p>“Yeah, if he can create the Divine Oracle Number Two, why can’t he modify his body?”</p><p>“If I were Dao Qiongcang, and I could create such a War Machine, would I resist the urge to use my mortal body and deify it?”</p><p>“Yes, I would.”</p><p>“But Dao Qiongcang doesn’t have a passive skill. He would not!”</p><p>In an instant, Xu Xiaoshou was enlightened and understood a lot more.</p><p>He recalled Ajie was discovered on Abyss Island. The reason was due to some research by Dao Qiongcang that could even stop the worlds of the five Holy Emperors.</p><p>However, if he was a fanatic who looked gentle on the outside but was crazy on the inside, would he really stop when others told him to do so?</p><p>Then, what kind of research did not have any special forms of expression, nor would it be undetectable even if one were to stare at it at all times?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized that Dao Qiongcang had completely transformed himself.</p><p>His weak combat strength as a Divine Sorcerer was just a disguise.</p><p>Was that his strategy to win a battle that was thousands of miles away so as not to expose the fact that he was a muscular tyrant?</p><p>“D*mn you, Dao Qiongcang!” Xu Xiaoshou shook his head.</p><p>No wonder he felt that this Elder Dao the Flamboyant was a little strange.</p><p>He was very strong and gave one a sense of danger on a whim. His manner was also very brittle as if he was an ordinary demi-saint.</p><p>It turned out that what he revealed was only the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>He had hidden it too deeply!</p><p>However, could a body that was able to block the power of a Holy Emperor with just one arm make people cower?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stopped in midair and smiled faintly. “Dao Qiongcang, I’m still young. Can you tell me what ‘enough is enough’ meant?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was about to speak when his expression suddenly changed. He hurriedly looked at Rao Yaoyao and said. “Be careful!”</p><p>“Greater Teleportation Technique!” As the Art of Spiritual Array Disc under Xu Xiaoshou’s feet spiraled out, he no longer hid his smile. With a roar, he launched a Divine Secret augmented by the power of a Holy Emperor at Rao</p><p>Yaoyao.</p><p>Weng!</p><p>The Art of Spiritual Array Disc spread across the entire Abyss Island.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao, who carried the Cang Godhood Sword had only run halfway when the scene before her changed and she arrived in front of an exploding death energy.</p><p>At this moment, she felt as if there had been a Time Reversal.</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor didn’t appear, and she didn’t talk to Dao Qiongcang. Xu Xiaoshou still attacked her and forced her to a dead end with one finger. He said mercilessly.</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao, return my semi-saint person to me!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
