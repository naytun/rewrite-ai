(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>On the dragon’s head, Xu Xiaoshou stared at Water Ghost coldly and did not take any action.</p><p>However, when Water Ghost flashed out, the phantom of the actual secondary plane door opened and closed above Mu Ling’s head. It cut off the connection with the supreme saint calamity.</p><p>He had kept his promise!</p><p>This move made Xu Xiaoshou feel very uncomfortable.</p><p>You even resorted to moral kidnapping. Water Ghost, you’re so sneaky!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, step back!”</p><p>Mu Ling was freed from the supreme saint calamity. He felt the power of his own saint calamity. It was still very strong, but he noted that it had become much weaker.</p><p>He roared with all his might. He did not care about the standpoint between the Holy Palace and the Saint Servant anymore. He wanted to force Xu Xiaoshou to retreat.</p><p>In this type of Saint war, even if Xu Xiaoshou participated, he would only be treated as cannon fodder. How could he enter the game so easily?</p><p>There was a sizzling sound and Water Ghost had no way to turn back. He could not wait for Xu Xiaoshou and plunged into Dao Qiongcang’s body.</p><p>The divine Sinan spun, but not a single bit of light flashed from it. This was a sign that it was sealed.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang seized the moment before his body was teleported away. He turned his eyes leisurely and looked coldly at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Think carefully before you attack. I’ve given you a chance. Don’t make a mistake!”</p><p>What he referred to was… to connect with the Divine Array?</p><p>Are you really crazy? Do you really want to drag me into the Holy Divine Palace? Would I still have a chance to turn back?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know it there was a problem with his understanding or it Dao Qiongcang was too naive!</p><p>However, no matter what Water Ghost said, he believed that he did not have the strength to participate in such a Saint war.</p><p>Other than the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon that had lost its ability to fight, what else did Xu Xiaoshou have to support Water Ghost?</p><p>I have nothing, so I can only watch. If you guys play dirty, I’ll play dirty too… Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath and did a self hypnosis.</p><p>“Chi chi!”</p><p>In just an instant, after Dao Qiongcang was possessed, his body cracked and a mixture of dark red and inky colored liquid shot out from it.</p><p>Demi-saints were like ants under the Spell Forbidden Barrier. It was a fact.</p><p>Water Ghost had taken advantage of all kinds of benefits to succeed in his evil scheme, and he had all the qualifications to hurt Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>Before he could do anything, the supreme saint calamity struck again.</p><p>This time, even Dao Qiongcang couldn’t withstand it. All the beautiful jade pieces on his body exploded, and even his robe lost its luster.</p><p>His body was completely torn apart, and his blood and flesh flew everywhere.</p><p>“Oh my God!”</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao, did they take advantage of you?”</p><p>The spectators from all over Abyss Island held their heads and were dumbfounded.</p><p>The tables had turned, and even Dao Qiongcang was at a disadvantage. This speed of events was unimaginable.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated.</p><p>This was Dao Qiongcang, how could he be defeated so quickly?</p><p>Even if he was tricked by Water Ghost once, would Dao Qiongcang not have suspected that the secondary plane door might be fake?</p><p>As this thought flashed through his mind, everyone felt Abyss Island tremble.</p><p>“Long…”</p><p>A slight vibration could be felt, and streaks of spiritual lights suddenly shot into the sky from all directions.</p><p>One after another, 365 thick spiritual lights broke through the sky in an instant. Even the darkness brought by the saint calamity disappeared for a moment.</p><p>After that, nine rays of Holy Light shot up like nine pillars and it looked like the building was about to be toppled by them.</p><p>“This is?”</p><p>Everyone looked around.</p><p>Li Fugui’s eyes widened as he thought of something.</p><p>“Si Wu Formation!”</p><p>On the dragon’s head, Xu Xiaoshou’s spiritual light flashed. He finally realized what Dao Qiongcang had left for himself as a means of escape.</p><p>After all, Xu Xiaoshou had been inside the Divine Oracle before, so he had a clear understanding of the 365 Void Suppression Stele and the Nine Cores.</p><p>Now, didn’t the number and position of the pillars of light correspond with the activation of the Si Wu Formation?.</p><p>However…</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was clearly suppressed, so how could he control the great array that sealed the Inner Island of the Abyss Island – the Si Wu Formation?</p><p>“You!”</p><p>Inside Dao Qiongcang’s body, Water Ghost’s astounded voice stopped abruptly. He was clearly shocked by the activation of the Si Wu Formation.</p><p>This was not what he had expected!</p><p>As soon as he stopped speaking, Dao Qiongcang’s voice came out. It sounded slightly playful.</p><p>“Brother Yu MO, oh Brother Yu MO, it’s been so many years, why do you still like to use short attacks on the strong?”</p><p>“You’re strong in Spiritual Cultivation, not in the art of scheming. Why do you think you can suppress me?”</p><p>Due to the urgency of the battle, Dao Qiongcang was only sealed within the secondary plane door. It was not like the last time, where the Spell Forbidden Barrier covered the entire Abyss Island.</p><p>Or rather, Water Ghost knew that it was useless to include the entire Abyss Island. He could only focus solely on Dao Qiongcang to truly activate the seal…</p><p>However, Dao Qiongcang had predicted this, so he used Water Ghost’s method of thinking as bait to set up the Si Wu Formation in advance. He wanted to lure Water Ghost to take the bait?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly realized what was going on.</p><p>Last time, Abyss Island was enveloped by the Spell Forbidden Barrier, and Dao Qiongcang stood alone outside.</p><p>This time, Dao Qiongcang was controlled by the secondary plane door while the Si Wu Formation controlled the field from outside?</p><p>In both game plans, Water Ghost had hit the mark both times, and it was when he was still in the lead!</p><p>“This…” Xu Xiaoshou felt his head swell. This Elder Dao the Flamboyant was too showy!</p><p>Within Dao Qiongcang’s shattered body that was splattered with the blood and ink, an indifferent voice rang out and drifted across Abyss Island.</p><p>“With my status, the Si Wu emerged.”</p><p>“I’ll exhaust the power of the ancestors and seize your foundational roots.”</p><p>In an instant, the 365 spiritual lights on the island and the nine Saint pillars began to move.</p><p>As the great array was activated, dust billowed, mountains and rivers moved, and the divine secrets were tampered with.</p><p>On Dao Qiongcang’s palm, the divine Sinan still spun.</p><p>There was clearly no fluctuation of any spiritual source on its upper level at all.</p><p>At this moment, anyone could tell that the positions of the stars on the divine Sinan represented the various array eyes and array flags of the Si Wu Formation.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang did not use his own power to activate the Divine Secret, but he could make the Way of the Heavens operate on its own in advance and calculate the time to send down the divine punishment.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>In the saint calamity, a beam of light that was thicker, more powerful, and more ancient than the lightning descended from the sky. It was like a giant’s foot that was about to break the mountains and rivers.</p><p>“Power of the ancestral source!”</p><p>When he felt the power within, Xu Xiaoshou looked up in shock. He could sense the purest and most condensed power of the ancestral source within the beam of light.</p><p>This was even more powerful than the combined power of the devilish nature that Teng Shanhai had displayed. It was also more powerful than the diabolical force of Lei Xi’er’s God Devil Eyes that she could not fully control.</p><p>“He used the Si Wu Formation to restore the power of the ancestral source to its peak state and used Abyss Island as the energy core…”</p><p>“The power of the Heavenly Ancestor! Heavenly Ancestor’s attack! ”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wondered if Water Ghost had made preparations for this attack. After all, Abyss Island was his home ground.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s body exploded time and again, and Water Ghost could not escape.</p><p>Divine Thirty-Six Forms, great imprisonment secret technique!</p><p>It was a spell that Dao Qiongcang had cast on his body long ago during the previous saint calamity.</p><p>His body had long become a half-opened cage that waited for Brother Yu MO to enter.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was so shocked that his mouth hung wide open.</p><p>How could he even have deduced this?</p><p>This was simply too infuriating!</p><p>it!”</p><p>He had thought that Water Ghost was done for, but there should be a way to break out of this situation, right?</p><p>Then, Water Ghost’s slightly irritated and panicked cry sounded.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what are you waiting for?”</p><p>“When I die, when this unethical deed had been dealt with, then I’ll deal with you!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
