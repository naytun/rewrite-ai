Do you dare to say Xu Xiaoshou’s style was not taught by you?”</p><p>Mei Siren moved closer as he spoke. He frowned and chuckled. “Tell me, if the imagery of the Heart Sword Technique and the Heavenly Unravel can be passed down, it would be a great blessing. The great deeds of the ancient swordsman would be in vain if they were not made known to the world.”</p><p>Bazhun’an had a strange look in his eyes as he tried to pull his arm out of the old man’s grasp, but it seemed to be restrained by a huge force.</p><p>He sighed helplessly and said.</p><p>“If you all are able to learn… Hmm, let me think… It should be like this…”</p><p>“If I can pass it on, I definitely want to pass it on to you… Hmm, that doesn’t seem right either.”</p><p>Mei Siren’s eyes flashed coldly when he heard this, and he almost wanted to hit a certain person.</p><p>He flung the brat’s arm away, glared at him and said, “Ancient swordsman, why beat around the bush?”</p><p>“That’s great!”</p><p>Bazhun’an almost clapped and immediately said.</p><p>“If you guys had succeeded, Xiao Kongtong would have spread this technique in the Fringe Moon City already.”</p><p>“Unfortunately, even he doesn’t know how to do it, let alone other useless…</p><p>talents?”</p><p>“Of course, this does not include you.”</p><p>After a pause, Bazhun’an said.</p><p>“As for Xu Xiaoshou, our master-disciple relationship is only half a volume of the 10 Sections of the Finger Sword as well as the Sword Observation Manual that Xiao Kongtong passed to us.”</p><p>“Actually, this is not a ‘master-disciple’ relationship, so to speak. Besides, there had not been much taught and learned.”</p><p>“Maybe he received some inspiration from the Sword Observation Manual?” “Or he had new insights after he saw your famed sword Heavenly Unravel.”</p><p>“Perhaps, with the help of the four Holy Emperors, his force reached a new peak.”</p><p>Bazhun’an took a deep breath; he was clearly tired of talking.</p><p>“The Heart Sword Technique is for the cultivation of the heart, the will and the force.</p><p>“The opportunity had arrived. Even if I didn’t teach it, he could still master the imagery Heavenly Unravel. There’s nothing much to say.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was so talented?</p><p>Mei Siren had his doubts.</p><p>It was not that he underestimated Xu Xiaoshou, but it was because Bazhun’an was a prodigy. Even the later generations would still feel inferior unless they surpassed him in all aspects.</p><p>But who had the confidence to surpass Bazhun’an?</p><p>Mei Siren still had some faith in his student, so he didn’t voice his doubts.</p><p>He promptly asked another question, and with a strange combination of shamelessness and modesty, he said.</p><p>“The Heart Sword Technique cultivates the heart and the will. I understand this, but the cultivation of Force…</p><p>“Did you get it wrong?”</p><p>Mei Siren raised his head and asked this question cautiously. It was as if he was a child.</p><p>“The ones who cultivated the ‘Force’ in the Ten Thousand Sword Technique were led by the Feng family at the start. The Wrath of the Great Crimson God would be the end!”</p><p>“How can the Heart Sword Technique be related to the ‘Force’?”</p><p>Bazhun’an heard what he said and opened his mouth, but in the end, he did not speak.</p><p>“Are you going to tell me or not?” Mei Siren’s expression became serious.</p><p>Bazhun’an sighed and asked.</p><p>“How can there be a division in the swordsmanship?”</p><p>“The Unsheathing Sword is the perpetrator, and the sheathed sword is the one who officiated. However, there is only one sword. How can these two traits not coexist?”</p><p>“There are nine sword techniques, eighteen sword flows, and the third realm emotion sword. After a long time, one will become a God… However, how could her Rao Clan’s second realm Emotionless Sword Technique withstand a single strike from your Wisdom is Emptiness?”</p><p>“Is the Mountains and Seas Converge’s defense not enough, or is Mei Siren’s sword image too strong?”</p><p>“That’s not true!”</p><p>Bazhun’an was very eloquent and did not hesitate to explain.</p><p>“It’s all because the Rao family had cultivated the swordsman to reach a demonic state, while the Sword God had perfected the final-stage Eight Great Sword Techniques. With this as the main technique and the emotion sword as the auxiliary, she had borrowed the power of the mortal’s Mountains and Seas to unlock the mysteries and became a God.”</p><p>“She’s really naive. She’s using the emotion sword as her main weapon. It’s just a false impression, strong on the outside, weak on the inside.”</p><p>“Now that she had come to her senses, she has begun to focus on other sword techniques. Why are you still living in the past and so inflexible?”</p><p>Mei Siren blushed. However, he had a better understanding now. “Continue with your lecture.”</p><p>Bazhun’an choked for a moment, unsure if he was being sarcastic, but did not want to think more about it and said.</p><p>“The sword power is in the thousands and it is the source. This force is not that force, this force is also that force… Alright, you can comprehend it yourself!”</p><p>Mei Siren held his folding fan and his body trembled as if he had been enlightened.</p><p>When he regained his senses, Bazhun’an had already left and he could only see a shadow in the distance.</p><p>Mei Siren hurriedly caught up.</p><p>“Can you please clarify what you just said?”</p><p>“How about this, let me first tell you what I felt just now. Listen to it first.” “The person with the most powerful sword technique, Ling…”</p><p>“Mei Siren!” Bazhun’an felt he was about to have a headache. He couldn’t help but stop and look back. He spread his hands and said, “Look, is this the time to have a discussion?”</p><p>Mei Siren followed the direction of his hands and saw the battlefield of the Blood World and couldn’t help but wake up.</p><p>This hateful Xu Xiaoshou, what a killjoy!</p><p>“Ke ke, what you said is true. However, it is rather lonely on this trip. Why don’t we discuss it again… but it would take up some time!” “How about I compensate you for taking up your time?”</p><p>“If you need anything, I will be at your beck and call!”</p><p>Mei Siren patted his chest with his folding fan and made this promise.</p><p>Was this a matter about time and human relationship? When he faced Mei Siren’s burning gaze, Bazhun’an finally gave up,</p><p>“Alright then.”</p><p>He and Mei Siren walked side by side and discussed the Dao as they walked.</p><p>How many years had it been?</p><p>It had been a long time since Bazhun’an discussed the Dao with others..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
