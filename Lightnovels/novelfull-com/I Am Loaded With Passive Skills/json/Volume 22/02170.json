At least, I succeeded when I placed my hopes on you.” “This is the ‘action’ that the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon mentioned… According to the plan, I should immediately head to Tiansang Spirit Palace and lay my cards on the table with the Saint Servant.”</p><p>“But I hesitated.”</p><p>“Everyone knew how powerful the Holy Divine Palace was, but I don’t know who the other Saint Servants were, other than Bazhun’an.”</p><p>“I didn’t trust them at all, and I knew that my plan would never succeed. So, I went to the Tiansang Spirit Palace, but I didn’t go there to look for Sleeveless. I just stayed hidden quietly. My relationship with Bazhun’an was not very good, and he’s not reliable at all.”</p><p>Feng Yujin sighed. “The world is such a beautiful place. Without the rules of the Inner Island, we Holy Emperors only need to keep a low profile and we would be free. Why do we need to listen to others?”</p><p>When she heard this, MO MO shook her head.</p><p>She had long known that Feng Yujin was a person who did not keep his word.</p><p>This was indeed his usual style. Wherever there was danger, he would not go. He would always say something like, ‘It’s rare to be free, so I have to go and see the beautiful rivers and mountains.</p><p>Feng Yujin suddenly let out a long sigh, but he did not regret his previous choice. He said.</p><p>“The operation had been put on hold for a long time…”</p><p>“My mission was actually to go to Abyss Island to unseal the Si Wu Formation and open a convenient door for them to come out.”</p><p>“But what kind of place was Abyss Island? It was the center of everyone’s attention!”</p><p>“If I go there, I might be able to open the door, but there’s a high chance that I’ll be sacrificed or killed by the rules. You’ll die too. For your sake, I chose not to go.”</p><p>“Bazhun’an didn’t stop. He still continued to play… This brings us to the Infernal Hell Sea that he previously showed an interest in.”</p><p>“Great Infernal Ancestor spent hundred of years on his plans to nurture the Infernal lineage, but the people of this lineage did not recognize it.”</p><p>“However, the power of guidance he exerted will urge the descendants of the Infernal lineage to head to the Infernal Hell Sea that is also the White Cave, to accept the inheritance and become a vessel instead of a host.”</p><p>“In this day and age, the person who should have received the inheritance should be this Sleeveless Saint Servant, but in the end, due to a muddled mistake, it went to a young man…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?” MO Mo’s eyes moved.</p><p>“Yes, fate is so wonderful. He even snatched our championship in the Windcloud Competition and even defeated… Cough!”</p><p>When he realized he had digressed, Feng Yujin immediately returned to the topic at hand.</p><p>“In short, Great Infernal Ancestor’s backup plan should have been on Xu Xiaoshou’s body. It should have lasted until he went to Abyss Island.”</p><p>“Previously, because of… Cough, to maintain the freedom, I had also targeted him…Ahem.”</p><p>“Abyss Island, what happened?” MO MO didn’t pay any attention to him, she was only curious about the current situation.</p><p>With regards to this, Feng Yujin only had a vague idea, so he said.</p><p>“I was not there, so I don’t know the exact process. I only know what the general outcome would be if we act according to the plan.”</p><p>“If I didn’t cooperate, Bazhun’an would always be able to find someone more suitable. Xu Xiaoshou was obviously that person.”</p><p>“In the White Cave, you saw it for yourself. The Holy Emperor guided everyone to fight for Fourth Sword and removed the seal of the White Cave. He even blurred everyone’s impression of him.”</p><p>“Bazhun’an’s paralyzing plan might have been effective. The Holy Divine Palace doesn’t really care about the White Cave, and they’re only concerned about the minor details.”</p><p>“However, he met with Great Infernal Ancestor and the others in the White</p><p>Cave. They probably agreed on the time of descent for Abyss Island.”</p><p>“Abyss Island descended already!”</p><p>MO MO looked up toward the direction of the Lone Cliff. She could vaguely see the outline of the ancient Sky City.</p><p>Through MO Mo’s gaze, Feng Yujin could also see this. He sighed.</p><p>“I never thought that Bazhun’an’s plan would really succeed, or that it would go so far and so smoothly.”</p><p>“If the Holy Emperor had not crossed the Inner Island just now, I don’t think he would have succeeded.”</p><p>“But now, it seemed that Abyss Island’s situation had been set in stone. Even Hallmaster Dao might not be able to turn the tide.”</p><p>“What was Bazhun’an’s purpose?” MO MO couldn’t help but ask.</p><p>“Very simple.” Feng Yujin chuckled and didn’t hide anything. “Take the most opulent back garden of the Five Holy Emperors’ aristocratic families for yourself. With this as the foundation, you can have a bright future.”</p><p>Back garden… MO Mo’s eyes sparkled as she stared at a corner of Sky City in the distance and fell into deep thought.</p><p>“What about you?” MO MO paused for a moment and changed her statement. “What about us? Don’t we have to go to Abyss Island? You’re part of the plan, after all.</p><p>“Us?” Feng Yujin’s voice suddenly rang out. “Girl, stop joking! We’re not that outstanding, so we should know our limits, okay? It’s already good enough that you can wait for Bazhun’an’s fall to settle the score. How dare you stretch your neck forward and get yourself killed?”</p><p>You’re very self-aware, but why don’t you have any foresight… MO MO secretly shook her head. She thought that if he had followed the plan, he would have been considered as a dragon power or something.</p><p>She had an indifferent personality and did not care about these things.</p><p>It didn’t matter if he didn’t want to go.</p><p>Just as Feng Yujin said, since freedom was rare, one should go and see all the beautiful rivers and mountains. This coincided with her own thoughts.</p><p>In his mind, Feng Yujin sighed.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is really amazing!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
