(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Northern Region.</p><p>The Heavenly Covenant Void Realm Meeting.</p><p>On the side of the long table that had been temporarily constructed by the higher void’s power of the world, several shadowy forms were scattered about.</p><p>These people were obviously not real entities, and even their facial features were extremely blurry. In fact, it was an online gathering of the elites of the</p><p>Heavenly Covenant from all over the world.</p><p>The Heavenly Covenant was a very free and easy organization.</p><p>The Heavenly Covenant consisted of demi-saints and the higher void level. Their goal was to unite the experts of the Northern Region to resist the opening of the Northern Region’s extradimensional space and the invasion of these external factions. They held meetings from time to time.</p><p>This was an impromptu meeting. Before everyone was gathered, the initiator spoke.</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao, Saint Fall. Xu Xiaoshou killed her.”</p><p>A stone set forth a thousand ripples.</p><p>This sudden statement caused the figures of some of the people in the meeting to turn even more blurry. It was clear that there were intense fluctuations in their spiritual senses.</p><p>Some people’s upper bodies disconnected for a long time before they were reconnected.</p><p>It wasn’t that they had been hacked, but they stood up in their excitement.</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao, could it be that Rao? Xu Xiaoshou, was it that Xu?”</p><p>“It’s just as you thought.”</p><p>“Saint Fall? Are you saying that Rao Yaoyao had undergone sanctification?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“It’s the real deal.”</p><p>“Hiss! That was terrifying. A sword saint, but the one who killed her was a young man. Could this be another Bazhun’an? No, he’s even more ferocious than Bazhun’an!”</p><p>“Haitang’er, you’re one of the Saint Servants, right? Do you know this Xu Xiaoshou?” “Pfft, Elder Zhao, you’re too obvious. Why would Haitang’er answer?”</p><p>“I know him.”</p><p>“Oh? Tell me about it.</p><p>“But I think it’s time we considered the division of the Pu Xuan of the Jiang Clan. Since the Saint Servant made his move, there had not been much stability left for the Heavenly Covenant.”</p><p>“Uh, you mean… Jiang Buyi?”</p><p>“Yes, Xu Xiaoshou was also involved in his death.”</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>The Southern Region in the Land of Sin, at the Xu Yue Grey Palace.</p><p>This was a small world shrouded in gray fog. Its rules and orders were different from the Shengshen Continent. Chaos reigned everywhere, and it was not a place where ordinary people could stay for long.</p><p>Here, the world was spectacular and could be called a wonder.</p><p>There were white beast horns that pierced through the earth from the north, south, west, and east. They intersected in the eastern direction of the sky, and between the four horns, a huge, dark moon was seemingly ‘trapped’.</p><p>This moon could not be considered as overly big. Even though it was a hundred miles wide at a close distance, it could be said to be very small compared to an entire world.</p><p>It was actually an energy core that had been compressed for many years and created by countless generations of Xu Yue Grey Palace members. It served as the lighting function of this world that had no light.</p><p>Of course, it could also be detonated when necessary. Thus, the invaders would be buried in this small world.</p><p>Xu Yue was the name of this dark moon and the belief of all the members of the Xu Yue Grey Palace.</p><p>AS long as It was not destroyed, tne xu Yue Grey palace would exist torever. Even the Holy Divine Palace would not dare to invade it.</p><p>Below the Xu Yue Moon was the highest mountain in the Xu Yue World, the</p><p>Huitian Peak.</p><p>There was a magnificent palace on this Huitian Peak. The main frame was made of golden beast bones, that were pieced together by many techniques. The details displayed the natural charm of the beast bones.</p><p>To sum it up, it did not require too much housekeeping to maintain the facade.</p><p>The location of this palace was even more audacious. It was embedded in a dragon’s head and looked like a huge bloody mouth on the peak. It was anchored in its mouth and below it was the sheer cliff.</p><p>Primitive! Wild! Madness!</p><p>These three words were enough to describe the famous Xu Yue Grey Palace.</p><p>What made it stand out was that the dragon head did not belong to Huitian Peak. It was not a mountain rock, nor was it the work of nature.</p><p>The current Palace Master of Xu Yue Grey Palace was overly drunk at a</p><p>banquet. He made a bold bet and broke into the Seven Breaks Dragon Cave that very night and cut off the head of an actual dragon.</p><p>Before this, Xu Yue Grey Palace was located on Huitian Peak.</p><p>After that, Xu Yue Grey Palace was embedded in the dragon’s head.</p><p>Of course, from then on, there was an additional ban in this wild palace, no drinking and violators would be severely punished!</p><p>“Burp…”</p><p>There was a burp and the smell of alcohol permeated the air.</p><p>In the great hall, the illumination of the actual dragon’s eyes that were like night pearls emitted a faint dark red light. A beautiful woman with a voluptuous figure sat on the armrest of a dark purple beast bone throne. She had a wine pot in one hand and her cheek was cupped in the other. Her peach red cheeks glowed like blood, and her eyes shimmered like pools of water.</p><p>She had an extremely attractive figure. She stretched lazily on the beast bone throne, and her high-slit dress could not hide her beauty that was inadvertently revealed after she had too many drinks.</p><p>It was unknown how long she had been drinking, but the entire hall was filled with the smell of alcohol.</p><p>At this moment, even the jade hairpin that was a symbol of dignity had disappeared. Her slightly curled light purple long hair cascaded over her fragrant shoulders and was already soaked in wine.</p><p>“Everyone, hasn’t arrived yet… Burp?”</p><p>On the throne made of beast bones, the beautiful woman crossed her round legs and rested them high on the other side of the armrest. After she spoke, she raised her head and gulped down some more wine.</p><p>The fine wine trickled from her red lips, slid down her jade-like neck, and flowed into the deep valley in front of her chest alongside her wine-soaked hair.</p><p>“Palace Master Bai Zhou, not yet.” Beside him, a hunchbacked old man answered, his head and eyes lowered.</p><p>Everyone thought that Palace Master Bai Zhou was a man, but only those who had seen his real body knew that this fierce person was actually a woman.</p><p>There were a lot of things that he would not tolerate.</p><p>For example, if he found out that the disciples in the palace called him ‘her’ outside, teased him, and said bad things about him.</p><p>Another example was during and after drinking.</p><p>He would have an irregular but inevitable period of irritability every month.</p><p>Apart from that, Palace Lord Bai Zhou was very easy to talk to. If one followed the rules and served him well, he would not die..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
