(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>He sat cross-legged in the air with his eyes closed. When he sensed something strange, he opened his eyes, looking puzzled as to why the original body suddenly chose to expose him.</p><p>“Are you crazy?</p><p>After the consciousness of the second true body was cut off, the consciousness of the main body came back to remove the Vanishing Technique before heading back.</p><p>Did the original body do this just to show off?</p><p>Without a doubt, the second true body’s shout woke up Xu Xiaoshou and made him confused.</p><p>Something was wrong!</p><p>Why did he say so much?</p><p>At this moment, the Spiritual Cultivators on the island were completely confused and shocked.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou took the initiative to confess?”</p><p>“Was he really the one that controlled the Si Wu Formation? Did he really succeed in imitating Hallmaster Dao?”</p><p>“Can you believe that?”</p><p>In the air, Xu Xiaoshou, who was half Dao Qiongcang and half himself, sensed something. He used his spiritual sense to check the information bar, but he did not see “guided”. His pupils immediately trembled.</p><p>He had been tricked!</p><p>This was definitely the ‘power of guidance’, which belonged to the Holy Emperor, but in a more formless way!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had been affected by this trick in the White Cave by Yu Lingdi’s treasure.</p><p>In the Yunlun Mountain Range, he had followed the guiding power of the Holy Emperor’s treasure toss and walked all the way to the Lone Cliff.</p><p>However, that was only through the side effects of the Holy Emperor’s treasure.</p><p>Now that the Holy Emperor had personally used the power of guidance to focus on him, he couldn’t resist the ‘spiritual awakening’?</p><p>NO!</p><p>In other words, it was possible for something affected by the Holy Emperor’s treasure to be judged as a mental attack or control.</p><p>The gaze of Wangze, the Holy Emperor, only magnified Xu Xiaoshou’s desire to communicate.</p><p>He wanted to say…</p><p>He wanted to show off…</p><p>Under Holy Emperor Wangze’s ‘curiosity’ , he couldn’t control himself and said it out loud!</p><p>This was a kind of amplification of desire. His guiding power had already been cultivated to the point where no move could win against it… Xu Xiaoshou frantically warned himself to be on guard.</p><p>However, how should he guard against it?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang opened his mouth to speak.</p><p>“What?” Before he could speak, the sky floated down and asked, “How did you get Dao Qiongcang’s blood?”</p><p>Everyone, who heard this, was curious, as if the laws of the world had been twisted. In this situation, answering to a Holy Emperor’s question was a mortal’s fate.</p><p>“It’s all thanks to his precious disciple, Situ Yong…” Xu Xiaoshou scoffed.</p><p>“Cough cough! That’s enough…” A weak voice sounded from the communication talisman, “Take out your dragon scale, Xu Xiaoshou.” Xu Xiaoshou came back to his senses again, his expression uncertain.</p><p>Holy Emperor Dragon Scale could isolate this guiding power?</p><p>Previously, when the Demon Emperor Black Dragon appeared, he did not distinguish between friend and foe. He feared that it had ill intentions and would be the first to kill him after sensing the dragon-scale aura on his body.</p><p>As a result, the scale was left in the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>When his second true body was in the Yuanfu, he could use the dragon scale to cause trouble and the guiding power to amplify his will and survive.</p><p>Now that his second true body had been used, the dragon scale was isolated from the Yuan Mansion, rendering it useless.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly took out the scale and stuffed it into his arms. Only then did he feel safe.</p><p>However, at this moment, because of his words, Abyss Island was in an uproar.</p><p>“Plan Zero really exists. Situ Yongren even gave Xu Xiaoshou the blood of</p><p>Hallmaster Dao…”</p><p>“Oh my god, this is some juicy news!”</p><p>Amidst the discussions, Wangze didn’t move, but Dao Qiongcang felt someone looking at him.</p><p>His entire body tensed up. He knew that he had to give an explanation, but he could not give an explanation.</p><p>“Situ Yongren, you tell me.”</p><p>The faint light of the divine secrets flashed and disappeared. A hesitant, nervous, and anxious figure appeared.</p><p>“Supreme Master, Holy Emperor Wangze, listen to me…” Situ Yongren said in a panic as soon as he appeared.</p><p>“There’s no need to pressurize him. I took his Holy Blood by force. It’s in the deep sea.” Xu Xiaoshou interrupted.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes turned.</p><p>[Attention received, Passive Points +862.]</p><p>[Suspected, Passive Points +663.]</p><p>Situ Yongren’s face turned pale. He wanted to go up and tear Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth apart, but he didn’t dare to.</p><p>He hurriedly turned around. “Saint Wangze…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s aura was still there. He interrupted Situ Yongren’s words with a glance and said again,</p><p>“You don’t have to wonder why I only stole the treasures and kept him alive. Situ Yongren is actually very strong. He escaped my pursuit in the deep sea.”</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points +556.”</p><p>Shut up!</p><p>Situ Yongren was completely flustered. Who would believe this!</p><p>He was too afraid that Holy Emperor Wangze would kill him with a single glance.</p><p>However, while everyone was shocked by the content of Xu Xiaoshou’s words, the leaders of the battlefield didn’t care about an insignificant figure like Situ Yongren at all.</p><p>This was because of the Communication Talisman!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s expression changed. Dao Qiongcang’s eyes focused, and even Wangze’s figure seemed to have solidified.</p><p>The three of them looked at Xu Xiaoshou’s chest at the same time, where the weak voice came from. The three of them said at the same time.</p><p>“Bazhun’an?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
