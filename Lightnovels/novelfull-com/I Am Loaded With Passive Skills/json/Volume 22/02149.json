(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>The Time Ancestor Shadow Staff wasn’t enough to control the Holy Emperor, Wangze, who had revealed his killing intent.</p><p>The Azure Finger struck again!</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou did not give in. He flipped his palm and the Imitator appeared.</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>This move made people laugh.</p><p>Was he at his wit’s end? He could only take out one of the Great Psionic Weapons.</p><p>This thing was useful against demi-saint but against a Holy Emperor…lt could only be said to be a joke!</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou was not here to be funny this time. He was serious. As he held the Imitator, his body began to change.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Everyone was shocked because the other half of Xu Xiaoshou’s body suddenly turned from Yan Wuze to Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>That’s right, it was not an illusion, it was Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao?”</p><p>“That’s impossible. How could Xu Xiaoshou have the blood of the Hallmaster…Uh, could it be…during the battle just now?”</p><p>At this point, everyone had a realization.</p><p>However, Dao Qiongcang, who was hiding in the deep pit far away from the battlefield, was shocked.</p><p>As a Divine Sorcerer at the Saint Stage, he had a habit of never leaving anything of his own to his enemies.</p><p>This included blood, hair, and even the corners of his used clothes.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang himself could use these things to curse, lock onto the aura, and calculate the secrets of the heavens. Moreover, he knew Xu Xiaoshou had Imitator…</p><p>Under such circumstances, how could he not be on guard?</p><p>In the battle just now, Xu Xiaoshou had indeed caused him to bleed, but all the blood that had left his body had been specially processed and had nothing to do with Qiongcang’s body.</p><p>Once blood left his body, it would lose the protection of Saint Energy and would instantly evaporate in the Dragon Melting Realm.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang recalled carefully.</p><p>He was 120% sure that Xu Xiaoshou had never taken anything that belonged to him during the fight, even the blood that could be used by the Imitator.</p><p>Then, the problem was…</p><p>“How can he use an Imitator to become me?”</p><p>“Could it be fake?”</p><p>What broke all the doubts was the light pillar that moved around on Abyss Island as Xu Xiaoshou’s body transformed into Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>Eight Holy Lights and 365 spiritual lights.</p><p>Other than that, there was also the holy light that Dao Qiongcang had gathered from the power of the saint calamity and temporarily condensed in the Desolate Inferno Domain.</p><p>They all moved!</p><p>“Si Wu Formation…”</p><p>“I understand now! Plan Zero?” “Hallmaster Dao made a move. Perhaps, he couldn’t bear to see Xu Xiaoshou</p><p>“My God, this, this is too exciting!”</p><p>The spectators were all dumbfounded.</p><p>However, at this moment, Li Fugui, who was the best at jumping around and slandering the Holy Divine Palace, was silent.</p><p>He couldn’t understand the situation and was deeply shocked…</p><p>As one of them, Li Fugui knew that Plan Zero did not exist.</p><p>However, looking at the scene before him, if it was not Hallmaster Dao, then it could only be that the Imitator was used successfully and Xu Xiaoshou activated Si Wu Formation…</p><p>However, the Divine Secret was not an attribute, but a special ability. How could it be imitated?</p><p>Moreover, how could one even learn how to control the Si Wu Formation?</p><p>It was simply off the charts!</p><p>“Buzz.”</p><p>The 374 light pillars of the Si Wu Formation stopped in a special position. The moment the Azure Finger pointed at Xu Xiaoshou, the formation was activated.</p><p>The Heavenly Ancestor Light descended and completely enveloped Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Erased?”</p><p>Everyone was still suspicious.</p><p>However, it was not erased! It was really an act of defense!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>With a loud explosion, the Holy Emperor’s finger descended from the stairwell. After being weakened, it was just as Xu Xiaoshou had calculated. It could no longer break through the defense of the Heavenly Ancestor’s Light.</p><p>“Boom boom…”</p><p>The power of his fingertip rubbed against the light of the Heavenly Ancestor, and the airwaves rolled layer by layer, causing the space to explode.</p><p>Despite the howling wind and the fluttering of Xu Xiaoshou’s clothes, he was completely unharmed under the protection of the Heavenly Ancestor’s power.</p><p>“Hell.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could even smile. The corners of his mouth began to curl up, and the arc became wider.</p><p>He watched as the power of the Azure Finger was obliterated by the power of the Heavenly Ancestor. At this point, he finally could not hold it in anymore and laughed loudly.</p><p>“Hahahaha…”</p><p>“Rao Wangze, is that all? Is that all you have?”</p><p>The entire island was deathly silent.</p><p>Everyone’s gaze turned to the disappearing Stairway to Heaven and the shadow that was approaching from above.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was crazy.</p><p>However, no one had expected him to be so arrogant in front of a Holy Emperor.</p><p>Could Wang Ze, the Holy Emperor, endure such mockery?</p><p>However, no one could wait for Holy Emperor Wangze to lose control. This person’s temperament and self-restraint had long been cultivated to the extreme, and he was not moved by the words of an ant.</p><p>A calm and emotionless voice drifted down from the sky.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang?”</p><p>That was the voice of the Holy Emperor!</p><p>Without a doubt, Holy Emperor Wangze was questioning Dao Qiongcang! The Hallmaster, who was hiding outside the battlefield, could no longer stay calm. He flew out and shouted.</p><p>“That wasn’t my doing.”</p><p>He did not explain much.</p><p>Even though there were still people on Abyss Island who didn’t believe it, the Holy Emperor seemed to believe it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had tried his best to see the true form of the shadow, but he could not do it.</p><p>Suddenly, he felt Wangze, the Holy Emperor, looking over.</p><p>In fact, there was no substantial movement, nor was there any special power coming from it, as if it was just a gaze that was everywhere… Xu Xiaoshou laughed even louder and explained proudly, “Are you stupid?”</p><p>“When your finger descended, I began to calculate.”</p><p>“You’re just the thought incarnation of a Holy Emperor. I only need to open my second true body and drip Dao Qiong Cang’s Holy Blood into the Imitator to</p><p>obtain the information and the temporary control of the Si Wu Formation.</p><p>With the help of the Art of Spiritual Array Disc and the Unity of Man and the Heavens, I can break your finger.”</p><p>At this point, the Vanishing Technique was lifted.</p><p>Stepping on the Art of Spiritual Array Disc, the second true body that had been comprehending the information that the Imitator had obtained from the drop of Holy Blood was suddenly exposed..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
