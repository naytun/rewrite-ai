(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio     Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>It was only then that she realized she was already a demi-saint.</p><p>As for Xu Xiaoshou, he was still in the Sovereign Dao Realm, but he had borrowed the power of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>She had actually felt helpless and sought help from outsiders!</p><p>What was the difference between this and when she cried for help after she lost a fight when she was young?</p><p>After she realized this, Rao Yaoyao pursed her lips tightly. Her pretty face turned bitter and she didn’t say a word.</p><p>“Should I follow or not?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang also stared at Wangze Holy Emperor , but he reminded himself repeatedly to stay calm.</p><p>He always remembered the ‘Ming Yi’ and the saying, ‘Be wise and protect oneself’.</p><p>It was clear that Bazhun’an had set up a trap in the Desolate Inferno Domain for the Holy Emperor. There was a high chance that whoever went up would be at a disadvantage.</p><p>After all, he had been a chess player all year round. At this moment, Dao Qiongcang could step back and observe the entire scene from an outsider’s perspective.</p><p>Everyone was involved in the battle!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang saw how uneasy Rao Yaoyao was. This girl needed some time to digest her experiences on Abyss Island before she could be of any use. He couldn’t count on her at all now.</p><p>He also saw Wangze Holy Emperor’s hesitation. This was a disrespectful speculation, but it could be seen from the way Wangze Holy Emperor didn’t stop Xu, Mei, and Yu’s departure.</p><p>On the other hand, for the Saint Servant:</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had obtained the power of a Holy Emperor in the Desolate Inferno Domain. If he did it again, Dao Qiongcang would not be surprised.</p><p>He still had some Mystery Boxes. He didn’t need to give it to Mei Siren, so he could release another sword saint’s combat strength.</p><p>Water Ghost was already a demi-saint. Even though he was injured by Wangze Holy Emperor’s finger, the recovery ability of an Upanishad demi-saint should not be underestimated.</p><p>And…</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was keenly aware that on the battlefield, beside Rao Yaoyao, the finger of light was in the overlapping state of ‘explosion/unbreakable’.</p><p>It was the power of a Holy Emperor that Xu Xiaoshou had cast. It contained the power to harm the body and soul of a Holy Emperor.</p><p>“Wangze Holy Emperor didn’t even sort this out…”</p><p>“He’s only the Clone of Will of a Holy Emperor. His strength is limited, so I can only temporarily seal it… This is a bolt of lightning that would explode upon contact! ”</p><p>“In addition, we have to constantly resist the will of the Abyss Island Spirt to avoid being restricted by the rules…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang calmly used his right hand to lift the divine Sinan. His left hand was hidden in his sleeve as he lightly pinched his knuckles.</p><p>His eyes narrowed.</p><p>The road ahead was hazy!</p><p>The divine secrets were also disrupted!</p><p>There was also a Divine Sorcerer on the other side?</p><p>“Ming Yi, Ming Yi, Ming Yi…”</p><p>The overall situation of the divine secret could be tampered with. Dao Qiongcang was confident that with his skill as a Divine Sorcerer, no one would be able to interfere with his unique divine secrets.</p><p>He didn’t think about anything else and reminded himself repeatedly about his previous hexagrams to avoid being led into a trap under the Holy Emperor’s Guidance.</p><p>From his point of view, he had already lost this round.</p><p>As a result, the snowball grew bigger and bigger. When the outsiders saw that the Holy Divine Palace had a Holy Emperor, they felt relieved.</p><p>The more Dao Qiongcang watched, the more panicked he became. He only wanted to return to the Saint Mountain and start a new round.</p><p>“As long as you don’t die, anything can be discussed…” He glanced at Rao Yaoyao out of the corner of his eye.</p><p>It had not been easy to infuse his blood into a barely useful sword saint. His temperament had almost been worn out by repeated setbacks.</p><p>He just needed to return to the Saint mountain to recuperate. He believed that Rao Yaoyao would definitely undergo a qualitative transformation after the battle on Abyss Island.</p><p>After all these setbacks, one would succeed!</p><p>At that time, Rao Yaoyao would be the most obedient famed sword!</p><p>The situation was that Hua Changdeng, whose brain had been removed but had walked out from the Land of Screen and Candles, was one of the sharpest weapons on the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe!</p><p>“All I need is time…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had already made up his mind. Even if Wangze Holy Emperor agreed to enter the arena, he would choose to exclude Rao Yaoyao and himself and let him fight alone.</p><p>It didn’t take long before the shadowy form who was high up in the clouds</p><p>macle a move.</p><p>“You don’t have to follow me.’</p><p>When he heard this, Dao Qiongcang relaxed. It seemed like Wangze Holy Emperor was also worried and was prepared to hold back.</p><p>He would be the biggest supporter from behind.</p><p>“I want to go!” Rao Yaoyao said stubbornly.</p><p>Before Wangze Holy Emperor could reply, Dao Qiongcang’s heart jumped. “You stay here.” He said hurriedly.</p><p>“I have to go.” Rao Yaoyao’s eyes lit up. She would kill her enemies on her own.</p><p>“There’s no need. I said you’ll stay, so you’ll stay.” Dao Qiongcang was adamant. He didn’t offer any explanation, as if he was certain that Rao Yaoyao would obey.</p><p>This forceful voice caused Rao Yaoyao’s aura to soften.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao looked over and saw the worry hidden in Dao Qiongcang’s eyes.</p><p>This guy never spoke without a purpose. Wangze Holy Emperor was here, what was he worried about?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao rolled her eyes and frowned. She chose to ask directly.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang gave a standard answer almost at the same time.</p><p>“To protect me.”</p><p>Protect him?</p><p>Wait, was that to lure the tiger away from the mountain?</p><p>Their actual target was Dao Qiongcang?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was deep in thought as she watched Wangze Holy Emperor leave. She sent a strand of her saint’s will to lock onto Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>It was fine even if she died.</p><p>But this guy was too important, he could not die!</p><p>Desolate Inferno Domain.</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>The saint calamity that hadn’t been accelerated by time, had just entered the late-stage.</p><p>Mu Ling was submerged in the thunder calamity, but his condition was excellent.</p><p>It was obvious he was not concerned that he would successfully transcend the tribulation.</p><p>Bai Lian was the guardian outside the arena. Suddenly, the space that was not too far away changed, and three figures appeared.</p><p>He stood up in surprise. “Xu…”</p><p>In just an instant, Bai Lian’s expression became emotionless. Xu Xiaoshou glanced at him, closed his eyes and said angrily.</p><p>“Take your Supreme Master and scram!”</p><p>Bai Lian subconsciously wanted to nod but quickly stopped. Without saying a word, he flashed to the other side and informed his Supreme Master via telepathic communication to leave the arena and transcend the tribulation outside the battlefield. At the same time, he added some harsh words..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
