(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“What is he up to?”</p><p>Originally, it was already unbelievable that Hallmaster Dao and Sword Saint Rao were forced to flee by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Xu Xiaoshou did not chase after them, but only raised his hand instantly. There was a subtle expression on his face.</p><p>His sly smile as if he enjoyed himself immensely was even more unfathomable.</p><p>“He’s not planning to play the game of ‘I’ll let you run for Ten Auras, right?</p><p>Hiss, this is a little disgusting!”</p><p>“That’s right, Little Xu… He only inherited the power of a Holy Emperor, what’s there to preen about?”</p><p>“I can do it too. I can do it!”</p><p>“Stop bragging. You’re up to it? The moment the Holy Emperor’s power entered your body, you would explode! You’re not even qualified to be a host body, and you want to compare yourself to Lord Shou?”</p><p>“No, I can’t stand it anymore. Hallmaster Dao’s battle was too intense!”</p><p>“Then you’ll go?”</p><p>“Li Fugui, right? I’ve really tolerated you for a long time… Uh, why is it a little hot?”</p><p>“Wait, something’s wrong, white flame! Infernal white flame!”</p><p>Everyone was still in a discussion when they suddenly heard a Pfft sound. They all pointed at each other in surprise.</p><p>The temperature in the First Hall of Sins increased drastically!</p><p>White flames rose from the buildings, the cracks in the ground, the vegetation, and human bodies. This phenomenon was beyond explanation.</p><p>A burning pain followed…</p><p>They were clearly outside the battlefield. Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have lost his sense of propriety and was about to throw everyone into the sea of fire.</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators who watched the battle panicked. They tried to extinguish the flames on their bodies, but it was as if they used firewood to put out a fire. Their spiritual sources were ignited.</p><p>Those who tried to use the power of the Path Principles to put out the white flames ignited the Path Principles around them instead.</p><p>“F*ck! I’m burning!”</p><p>“Me too. I’m burning up…”</p><p>“How do we get rid of these white flames? I’ve heard that we can use the banishment technique; use the Great Path to wrap up the infernal white flames and throw it out…But why is it not working?”</p><p>“Brother, this is the white flame of the Holy Emperor!”</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The strange sound grew louder and echoed in all directions. The ground shook violently.</p><p>Soon, a pure white Ember Heart leaped out from the top of Xu Xiaoshou’s head, and the entire Abyss Island seemed to have been placed in an oven.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>White pillars of fire rose into the sky from the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>A person who stood next to the pillar of fire was sent flying instantly and his entire body was set ablaze.</p><p>Even though he used all of his strength, the white flames were like maggots that could not be expelled from his bones.</p><p>“Ahhhhh!”</p><p>Screams and wails filled the air.</p><p>It was not only in the First Hall of Sins, but also in the Desolate Inferno Domain, Sleeping Valley, Blood World, Fallen Abyss, and so on.</p><p>There were loud rumbles that echoed all over Abyss Island and a heavenly flame shot into the sky.</p><p>This bright white flame was even more dazzling than the 365 Void Suppression Stele’s eight core spiritual and Holy Light.</p><p>In terms of numbers, they completely crushed them!</p><p>“He, he wants to…”</p><p>Everyone seemed to awaken from a dream. They realized that Xu Xiaoshou, who had the Holy Emperor’s power, didn’t need to chase after them.</p><p>His vision covered the entire Abyss Island. As long as he attacked, everything would be within his attack range.</p><p>How could Dao Qiongcang and Rao Yaoyao escape from Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>“Boom boom boom…”</p><p>The pillars of fire that shot out from the space and the ground pursued Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>Even though Dao Qiongcang and Rao Yaoyao had split up, he could still see with his saint’s will that Rao Yaoyao suffered the same fate.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stopped where he was. As far as his eyes could see, the entire island was covered in flames as he chased the Saints away!</p><p>“Is he crazy?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was confused.</p><p>He knew that Xu Xiaoshou had obtained the Mystery Boxes and had the ability to modify them so he could avoid the death countdown.</p><p>However, the mystery boxes could only dodge the Perception of the Way of the Heavens!</p><p>This was evasion, not immunity!</p><p>Its principle was to reduce a big matter to a small one, and transform a small matter into nothing. With the help of the Divine Secret, it would treat the destruction within a certain range as if nothing had happened.</p><p>But now…</p><p>Such a large-scale destruction covered the entire island.</p><p>No matter how strong the Mystery Boxes were, they could not avoid such an anomaly!</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou attacked in this manner, he would definitely be targeted by the Abyss Island Spirit. Had he gone crazy and sought his death? What was he doing?</p><p>Unless…</p><p>“Unless there were no restrictions on his attacks, and he obtained the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy that Bei Huai mentioned before, and it is currently in progress?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s pupils constricted when he thought of this answer.</p><p>This meant that many of his plans had to be stopped in time!</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou was also recognized by the will of the Heavenly Ancestor, his danger level would be raised to the highest level!</p><p>“Bazhun’an, Bei Huai, Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>“Other than the Heavenly Ancestor’s Blessing that was scattered outside and</p><p>obtained by the two of them, there’s only one left. It’s in the Zhen Huang</p><p>Palace.”</p><p>“Void Crystals are difficult to come by and there’s a talent limit to exchange them for the Heavenly Ancestor’s Blessing. No one had been able to successfully exchange for that so far.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou’s talent had been recognized and exchanged?” At this moment, the white wall of fire blocked Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>He was besieged from all sides!</p><p>Even the Great Path was ignited!</p><p>To cross over, even the space-time attribute was a little difficult, let alone the Divine Secret?</p><p>At this moment, Dao Qiongcang, who was still in shock, finally couldn’t help but turn around and look into the distance, at that dangerous person.</p><p>He had fled to the Sleeping Valley.</p><p>From afar, he saw Xu Xiaoshou, who stood above the sea of fire in the First Hall of Sins with both his hands raised high.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was laughing hysterically. It was obvious that he had suffered a mental breakdown due to the immense strength.</p><p>However, there was still a touch of disdain on his face that he had previously shown. It was as if he was a cat that played with a mouse as he watched Rao Yaoyao and himself flee in such a sorry state.</p><p>This fellow, this expression…</p><p>It could indeed be said that after he obtained this power, the villain became successful and was as annoying as a nouveau riche.</p><p>However, at a certain moment, Dao Qiongcang caught a glimpse of a young Bazhun’an amid that lawless manner..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
