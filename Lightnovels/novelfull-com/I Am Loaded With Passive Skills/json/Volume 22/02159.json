(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>The Taicheng Sword tore through the air.</p><p>Mei Siren broke through the sky.</p><p>The two of them merged into one amid the storm of sword energy and disappeared completely.</p><p>However, just like in his memories, a grand, ancient, and terrifying scene appeared in an instant.</p><p>“Whoosh.”</p><p>The Sword Will condensed.</p><p>The sky turned dark and it was already sunset. The afterglow of the setting sun shone on Abyss Island, and the golden spots were dyed green. They were all formed by the Sword Will.</p><p>The Great Path of Time was recalled. The Azure Finger went back in time. The world returned to its ancient state. It was as if it had entered the prehistoric times. The sun reappeared, and time returned.</p><p>Everything went back to its original state. The shadow of the sword jumped out of the ancient forest and stirred up ripples on the lake. At first, it was just a dot. When it moved in the sky, the sword shadow turned into an ancient giant city.</p><p>That was the Taicheng Sword!</p><p>Its main body had condensed an entire world’s origin!</p><p>Too high, too big, too far away, too ancient; The city is for the people, for the world, for the mortal lives, for the present!</p><p>The Taicheng Heavenly Unravel turned into the image of the Taicheng and met the Azure Finger.</p><p>Mei Siren had only recently undergone his sanctification.</p><p>However, at this moment, he had perfectly demonstrated the abnormal combat strength of an ancient swordsman. It could not be measured by his cultivation level at all.</p><p>When the shadow of the Taicheng collided with the Azure Finger, it seemed to have awakened the ferocious ancient giant in the city. It raised its sword and only half of its body was exposed.</p><p>It was an almost infinitely huge sword image!</p><p>Thousands of swords worshipped above its head, dust floated around its body, and its hands were empty… It filled the entire sky of Abyss Island!</p><p>The lower half of its body could not be seen, but at its waist was the Taicheng, the strongest defense!</p><p>The Azure Finger didn’t even manage to shake the image of the Taicheng. The ferocious sword image’s Azure MO Swords had already crossed and slashed across the sky.</p><p>Rumble! Rumble!</p><p>The Holy Emperor pointed a finger and a burst of sword energy exploded into multicolored lights that filled the sky.</p><p>“Oh my God…”</p><p>This sword strike made everyone’s hearts palpitate.</p><p>Water Ghost who was outside the battlefield of the Desolate Inferno Domain fell silent. Even he did not have the confidence to take on this sword.</p><p>This was an ancient swordsman!</p><p>This was Mei Siren!</p><p>Even an Upanishad demi-saint was scared of his direct combat strength.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao who hovered in the sky closed her eyes slightly and clutched the Xuan Cang tightly.</p><p>The divine sword Xuang Cang let out a low whimper. After all, it was not a good match for its current master.</p><p>It had also chosen another master because it yearned for such a realm.</p><p>It had fought with the vicious sword four times before, but at this moment, it did not dare to fight with the Heavenly Unravel Taicheng.</p><p>At this moment, even if the Five Great Divine Instruments of Chaos were to gather together, they would still be led by the Taicheng!</p><p>Outside the Forest of Miracles, Bazhun’an had already set his pace. He looked into the distance, but could not see much.</p><p>He was already used to it when people exclaimed over the famed sword</p><p>Heavenly Unravel.</p><p>After a quick glance, he looked away and chuckled.</p><p>“The Taicheng was created out of chaos and was given to the Sword Human, not for fame but for its purity… Unfortunately, Master Siren is not an old master and thus not a perfect match for the Taicheng Sword.”</p><p>“Fortunately, the Taicheng Sword can still resonate with him. But even if it can, it’s still so difficult.</p><p>“Sigh, I can only hope that forcing the famed sword Heavenly Unravel won’t cause too much damage.”</p><p>Bazhun’an sighed and continued to move forward and felt a little vexed for no reason.</p><p>Was it really that difficult?</p><p>In the Desolate Inferno Domain, the imagery of the Taicheng broke through the Azure Finger and chased after the form in the distance.</p><p>At this point, even Wangze Holy Emperor had to be careful.</p><p>Indeed, he could see that if Mei Siren used this move forcefully, there would be damages later.</p><p>However, the future was the future. The current strength of the Taicheng Heavenly Unravel was unquestionable.</p><p>Under everyone’s gaze, Wangze Holy Emperor’s figure faded away and then slowly solidified. In the end, he turned into a tall, otherworldly man.</p><p>His facial features were still blurry; that was obvious when one considered the life and death experience that a mortal Saint had to undergo. However, when everyone looked at him, they could still see a hint of amusement in his blurry expression.</p><p>“Mei Siren? Interesting….”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
