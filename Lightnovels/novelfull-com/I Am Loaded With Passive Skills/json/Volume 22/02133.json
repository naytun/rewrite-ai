(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio     Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>However, his absolute sobriety and rationality told him that even Dao Qiongcang was shocked by Xu Xiaoshou’s performance. Xu Xiaoshou had also saved him…</p><p>Therefore, Plan Zero could not be real!</p><p>There was only one explanation left…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had watched the Divine Thirty-Six Form a few times and secretly learned them all!</p><p>“What kind of talent was this?”</p><p>Even though Water Ghost had mastered the Water-type Upanishad, his throat was dry at this moment. He looked at Xu Xiaoshou as if he saw a freak.</p><p>Not even Bazhun’an had been this abnormal!</p><p>The legend of the Eighth Sword Deity paled in comparison to this!</p><p>Sword Technique, Body Technique, Spiritual Cultivation, Divine Secret Technique… Xu Xiaoshou was proficient in everything!</p><p>How could anyone measure up to that?</p><p>For the first time, Water Ghost who had the power of the Upanishad, felt inferior.</p><p>“+(Suspected, Passive Points+) +1211.” “+(Acknowledged, Passive Points+)+886.” “+(Feared, Passive Points+) +479.”</p><p>“+(Regarded, Passive Points+)+230.”</p><p>The Information Bar jumped wildly and almost could not stop. The Passive Points rose repeatedly.</p><p>Above the sea of fire, Xu Xiaoshou finally couldn’t hold back his smile.</p><p>He merely tried it out. He had only copied the fluctuations of the Divine Secret when Dao Qiongcang performed that technique. He had yet to fully understand the principles behind it.</p><p>Unexpectedly, it succeeded!</p><p>If he succeeded this time with this formula, it meant that he could succeed with the others too. How could he not feel happy?</p><p>At this moment, the Holy Emperor’s Lv.o Weaving Expertise finally blossomed with its own brilliance.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s spells could be replicated!</p><p>In addition to the divine creation, it meant that Xu Xiaoshou had half of Hallmaster Dao’s qualifications!</p><p>Above the sea of fire, Xu Xiaoshou saw how Dao Qiongcang’s eyes throbbed and the fear in Rao Yaoyao’s beautiful eyes.</p><p>He smiled and spread out his hand. In front of everyone, he gently waved his hand in the air. With an open mind, he said.</p><p>“Alright, my dear little mice.”</p><p>“Don’t blame me that I did not remind you two. Before my power disappears, you should cover your heads and run like rats.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression changed and his aura soared into the sky. Like a cat that toyed with a mouse, he cast a teasing look at Dao Qiongcang and Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>At this moment, he was a Holy Emperor while Dao Qiongcang and Rao Yaoyao were only demi-saints.</p><p>Furthermore, all their trump cards had been taken away by him!</p><p>What was there to fear?</p><p>“This can’t be. At the very least, it shouldn’t be…”</p><p>In the ruins of the First Hall of Sins, the members of the Holy Divine Palace, or all those who were loyal to justice and could not stand the Saint Servants, were worried.</p><p>They did not want to see what would happen next.</p><p>However, the reality was that Xu Xiaoshou was like a villain who had achieved ultimate success. It seemed that no one could stop him.</p><p>Even the unpredictable Hallmaster Dao!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang took a deep breath as he met Xu Xiaoshou’s teasing gaze.</p><p>He was about to disappoint everyone.</p><p>He turned to look at Rao Yaoyao and shouted.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>The sound was so loud that it echoed across the entire Abyss Island like the sword cries of sanctification. It broke the hearts of those who heard it.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao was forced to run by Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>“This is the result of a Go player who entered the game…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the two figures who fled in embarrassment and felt that they were like clowns.</p><p>He finally understood that Dao Qiongcang was not invincible.</p><p>Even Bazhun’an was the same. As long as they did not stand behind the scenes but in front of the stage, they would have flaws.</p><p>Some were scheming, and some were being schemed against.</p><p>Any seemingly perfect existence would also meet with Dao Qiongcang’s current predicament, as long as the opponent was strong enough.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, be careful…” Water Ghost also wanted to remind him that even though Dao Qiongcang looked panicked, he might have some schemes planned and he had to be careful.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Xu Xiaoshou looked over and smiled meaningfully. “Just go through your tribulation in peace.”</p><p>Water Ghost was speechless.</p><p>That’s right, did Xu Xiaoshou needed to be reminded?</p><p>This kid hadn’t felt any discomfort ever since he received the power of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>When ordinary people obtained this power, they were limited by their horizons and thinking habits. They might even need time to adapt.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could use it immediately. In the midst of his calculations, he could force Dao Qiongcang into such a state.</p><p>He could not be treated as a junior at all!</p><p>He was like a chess player who had entered the game. He should have been targeted everywhere like Dao Qiongcang, but due to his ‘weak’ appearance, he managed to avoid too many risks.</p><p>As a result, after Xu Xiaoshou entered the game, his presence was too small. He was basically used as another Go player who manipulated everything behind the scenes!</p><p>This way…</p><p>On the surface, it was him; secretly it was Bazhun’an, but in reality, it was Xu Xiaoshou who controlled the situation. Water Ghost suddenly understood why Bazhun’an liked to use Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>This guy’s age and realm were obviously an open scheme. Even if someone noticed it, they would eventually ignore it even if they didn’t want to.</p><p>He was too useful!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang never expected that he would be forced into this situation by Xu Xiaoshou</p><p>“Run?”</p><p>“Can you escape?”</p><p>As he stepped on the sea of fire, Xu Xiaoshou looked like a God that had descended to the world as he watched the two figures who fled into the distance.</p><p>He sneered and his spiritual senses spread across the entire Abyss island with the boost of his Holy Emperor power.</p><p>At this moment, the image of Water Ghost’s ink world that submerged the entire Abyss Island flashed across his mind.</p><p>That’s right, he didn’t have the true power of Upanishad, nor did he have the Sea God’s Trident.</p><p>However, he had the Fire Path Wheel, Ember Heart, Flame Python, and the power of a Holy Emperor.</p><p>“If you manage to escape, I Xu Xiaoshou, will take your surname!” Puff!</p><p>Suddenly, a strange sound came from the edge of Abyss Island.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stepped into the First Hall of Sins and stood on the nine extreme grounds. He raised his hands in the air as if he wanted to detonate the entire island..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
