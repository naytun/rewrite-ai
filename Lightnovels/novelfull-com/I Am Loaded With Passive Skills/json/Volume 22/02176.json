(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>After he analyzed the situation, he had already discovered Xu Xiaoshou’s vulnerable spot.</p><p>In his eyes, Xu Xiaoshou was no longer a junior, but a combination of the powers of the four Holy Emperors of the Inner Island.</p><p>This was enough for him to take the matter seriously!</p><p>Thus, Wangze Holy Emperor, who didn’t care about his reputation, used the safest method to fight.</p><p>“Wind Escape, Traceless.”</p><p>He smiled and formed a pinching spell with his fingers. His body immediately dispersed. He actually chose to hide instead of fighting head-on.</p><p>“Escaped?”</p><p>This move not only stunned the onlookers, but even Xu Xiaoshou was caught off guard.</p><p>The majestic Wangze Holy Emperor actually turned tail and ran?</p><p>“Cowardly rat!”</p><p>In an instant, Xu Xiaoshou raised his head and laughed maniacally. His aura became even stronger as he mocked him openly.</p><p>“Rao Wangze, is this your so-called domineering aura of a Holy Emperor? You actually turned around and ran for your life when you met me Xu Xiaoshou?” “But if the wind is intangible, how can it attain the path?”</p><p>Under the dark sky, at the top of the lone building, Xu Xiaoshou closed his eyes after he finished his speech. The Fire Path Wheel appeared under his feet.</p><p>With the power of the Holy Emperor, he entered the Unity of Man and the Heavens. The path energy on his body flowed like a tide.</p><p>“Insight?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou had an insight again?”</p><p>“D*mn it, how can he attain an insight at any time? I’m so envious…”</p><p>This scene was too familiar.</p><p>At that time, at the Fallen Abyss on the head of the dragon, Xu Xiaoshou closed his eyes and comprehended the Divine Secret.</p><p>The current situation corresponded to the unremarkable Fire Upanishad array diagram under his feet.</p><p>This time, it was the fire element?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, what are you up to this time?</p><p>Even Dao Qiongcang’s heart skipped a beat. At this moment, the pressure that Xu Xiaoshou exuded was too strong.</p><p>His actions were incomprehensible, so no one knew how he would attack.</p><p>No one could predict what kind of tricks Xu Xiaoshou would play with the four Holy Emperors’ powers.</p><p>The battle was focused on the Desolate Inferno Domain.</p><p>However, no one noticed that when Xu Xiaoshou closed his eyes and entered the Unity of Man and the Heavens state…</p><p>Beside the Black Tortoise Gate, Lei Xi’er also closed her eyes. Her red lips quivered as the Saint Language rang out and shocked the world. “All ten thousand paths have Form, and all are flammable…” “The spirit of ember shone when the melted snow is cold…” “Although the wind has no form, it would definitely stir up the mist…” “The breath of Heaven and Earth returned to the heart…</p><p>This voice not only contained Lei Xi’er’s cold charm, but also the ethereal mystery of a Saint.</p><p>It sounded like thunder.</p><p>It happened in a flash, but it sent out shockwaves among the people!</p><p>“Fire…”</p><p>Almost at the same time, everyone seemed to understand.</p><p>Even the Spiritual Cultivators who didn’t cultivate the path of fire felt like they had a new understanding of fire.</p><p>As for people like Bai Lian and Mu Ling, they immediately entered a state of epiphany after they heard the Saint Language.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not stop for anything. When he closed his eyes, he digested all the path principle comprehension related to fire that emerged from the depths of his soul.</p><p>This was a gift from the Great Infernal Ancestor!</p><p>He closed his eyes and then opened them again. Xu Xiaoshou was in high spirits.</p><p>“Fire, and breathing…”</p><p>“Wind, in the heart…”</p><p>This comprehension of the path of fire didn’t concern anything else. It was about how fire should find wind. It was a way to kill Wangze Holy Emperor.</p><p>After Xu Xiaoshou finished his comprehension of the path or rather, after he learned the method to find people, he understood what he should do now.</p><p>His spiritual senses that had been strengthened to the point that it was even more powerful than his saint’s will, swept across the area. Xu Xiaoshou held his breath and focused his attention and discovered something strange far away in the Sleeping Valley.</p><p>It was not a specific figure, nor was there any outline to speak of.</p><p>It was simply ‘out of place’.</p><p>It was the leaves that danced when there was no wind, the dust that rolled about in a half circle on the bare mountain; it was a quiet, peaceful, rustling sound.</p><p>The wind passed by.</p><p>The path disappeared from this place.</p><p>Then, the so-called ‘invisible’ Wangze Holy Emperor could only stay hidden in the void.</p><p>“Rat, I found you!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grinned, and the look in his eyes turned into rays of vicious light. He pointed in the air and clicked his fingers.</p><p>“Pfft…</p><p>In an instant, in the Hundred Thousand Mountains in the Sleeping Valley, countless trembling Stone Giants were suddenly awakened and trapped by the rising Dragon Melting Realm.</p><p>“This!”</p><p>In the sky above the First Hall of Sins, Rao Yaoyao was astonished.</p><p>He found him just like that?</p><p>So fast?</p><p>Even if she didn’t want to admit it, what the Great Infernal Ancestor said earlier was ‘although the wind had no form, it would stir up the mist when it passed. This referred to the core of Wangze Holy Emperor’s wind escape technique.</p><p>This understanding, along with Xu Xiaoshou’s actions when he used ashes to break the wind technique.</p><p>No matter how stupid Rao Yaoyao was, she had already noticed something.</p><p>“Great Infernal Ancestor’s fire attribute is definitely above Wangze Holy</p><p>Emperor’s understanding of wind!”</p><p>“It had already attained the Fire-type Upanishad”</p><p>When Dao Qiongcang heard this, he turned his head silently. The corners of his mouth twitched. He didn’t want to say it, but after a long time, he sighed.</p><p>“He is the true form of the heavenly flame that was born from the Ashvattha divine Tree, one of the Nine Great Ancestral Trees. He is the fire of all fires, the Ultimate Grand Ancestor, and he was born with the emperor’s fate.”</p><p>“We’re at the Acquired Stage and did it through hard work. What’s with the comparison?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was at a loss for words. She glared at Dao Qiongcang and turned her head toward the Sleeping Valley.</p><p>Scorching heat!</p><p>Dazzling!</p><p>The blazing white sun in the Sleeping Valley seemed to fall from the sky and melted even the Great Path.</p><p>This also caused both the inside and outside to be completely isolated by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Banish!”</p><p>This was one of the tricks that Xu Xiaoshou often played with when he was in the disappearing state.</p><p>At that time, he was always extremely terrified..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
