(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“Who dared to be so impudent?”</p><p>This roar that didn’t conceal its killing intent, alarmed all the Spiritual Cultivators on the island.</p><p>When they saw the dark and gloomy face of the person who arrived, everyone exclaimed in satisfaction.</p><p>All of them were clearly just watching the show from the sidelines.</p><p>“Mu Ling!”</p><p>“It’s Mu Ling from the Holy Palace’s Infernal lineage!”</p><p>“Great, this is going to be fun. Bai Lian is Mu Ling’s disciple, and Mu Ling was one of the five great authorities of the former Holy Palace.”</p><p>“Before the Sleeveless Saint Servant betrayed the Holy Palace, he was Mu Ling’s Senior Brother. I heard that even though he betrayed the Holy Palace, they still tried their best to protect him.”</p><p>“This hatred can be traced back a long way. Everyone knew how protective the Holy Palace’s Infernal lineage was.”</p><p>Everyone sighed. Then, they quickly analyzed their combat strength.</p><p>“In terms of status, Mu Ling is the same as Hallmaster Dao, but in terms of strength, he is only a higher void!”</p><p>“A puny higher void is here to send him off? Mu Ling could fight an ordinary demi-saint at most, but how could Hallmaster Dao be just any ordinary person?”</p><p>“Brother, you’ve misjudged this. How can one’s combat strength be determined by one’s cultivation level alone?”</p><p>“Besides, Mu Ling had been stuck in the higher void level for so many years. Who dared to say that he is not ready to undergo sanctification? With the support of the Holy Palace, he would probably have already reached the semi-saint person level.”</p><p>“Yes, he might be like Water Ghost. He just missed an opportunity.”</p><p>“Alright, stop talking. The show is about to begin!”</p><p>Under the saint calamity, there was no time for all the parties to think about this, because Bai Lian was about to lose his life.</p><p>Mu Ling had wasted too much time when he rushed from the Fallen Abyss to the Desolate Inferno Domain.</p><p>After all, he wasn’t a demi-saint, he didn’t have the power of the Upanishad nor did he have the Holy Emperor mount.</p><p>The reason why he was able to cross more than half of Abyss Island to arrive at the Desolate Inferno Domain so quickly was because he had a premonition that something was about to happen to his disciple, so he used the Blood Escape Technique.</p><p>However, despite his great rush, he was still too late. He only witnessed the final moment when his disciple Bai Lian was submerged by the supreme saint calamity.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>Without any hesitation, Mu Ling made the craziest choice.</p><p>With a thought, the endless lava in the Desolate Inferno Domain was instantly dyed black.</p><p>The volcano collapsed and black flames rose into the sky.</p><p>The Nine Dragons Burning the Ancestor Saint Statue appeared behind Mu Ling’s back. The black flames on his body were compressed on the surface of his body in an extremely condensed manner.</p><p>It looked as if there was a layer of squirming black viscous energy attached to the surface of his body. It was extremely hot and powerful.</p><p>This move was very similar to the full-body version of the Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand.</p><p>However, there was a difference. The condensed black flames did not penetrate his skin and burn his body. Instead, they only skimmed over the surface of his body and increased his combat strength.</p><p>“Penetrating Divine Senses, Dragon Melting Fire!”</p><p>An uproar suddenly broke out in the ruins of the First Hall of Sins. Many people recognized this move.</p><p>“This was the famed skill of the Demi-Saint Infernal!”</p><p>“As the first successful representative of the Holy Palace’s research on the Penetrating Divine Senses, this Dragon Melting Fire can be used to perfectly restore the power form of the God Punishment Tribulation and even present itself in the form of an ultimate flame. It’s incomparably domineering.”</p><p>“The Holy Palace’s Infernal lineage is truly too strong. The Sleeveless Saint Servant didn’t learn the art of the Dragon Melting Fire, but he was able to use it as a foundation to create the Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand.</p><p>“Not only did Mu Ling cultivate the mutated black flame, but he also perfectly inherited the Demi-Saint Infernal power. This lineage is full of geniuses!”</p><p>“That’s why Bai Lian can’t die. Why don’t you ask around about the stringent conditions required in the selection of disciples in the Infernal lineage?”</p><p>“Yes, Mu Ling is really angry this time. But if that’s all, the higher void still doesn’t have the right to talk to demi-saint Hallmaster Dao. What would he Mu Ling didn’t waste any time after he took out the Dragon Melting Fire. He rushed instantly towards Bai Lian, who was completely submerged by the thunder calamity.</p><p>The supreme saint calamity after the mutation was too terrifying!</p><p>In an instant, hundreds and thousands of high-frequency lightning attacks bombarded the three of them who transcended the tribulation without any break.</p><p>It looked as if the heavens had distributed their anger on the three who transcended the tribulation. Three large, inverted thunder cones appeared in the void, which was shocking.</p><p>However, after Mu Ling passed by, he raised his black right fist that was wrapped in the Dragon Melting Fire and lifted it up in the most simple and basic manner.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>One punch broke the torrent of thunder and opened up the path of life and death!</p><p>The continuous thunder calamity attack was like a waterfall that had been cut off. It stopped for a short while and revealed the figure of the charred and dispirited Bai Lian below.</p><p>Bai Lian no longer resembled a human.</p><p>His eyes had been destroyed by the thunder calamity and his eyeballs had been shattered.</p><p>However, he could sense the familiar smell that had protected him since he was young, at the moment that his life was in the greatest danger.</p><p>“Mas… Honored…”</p><p>Bai Lian couldn’t even produce any tears. His facial muscles were contorted beyond recognition as he tried to speak.”</p><p>“Don’t fall for it…</p><p>“Please don’t… And the Holy Divine Palace… Opposition…”</p><p>There was no sound!</p><p>Mu Ling hugged his disciple. When he saw such a tragic sight, the black lava in the sky of the Desolate Inferno Domain started to break apart and riot.</p><p>“Don’t speak. Leave the rest to me.”</p><p>He gently placed Bai Lian into a black alchemy cauldron and flipped it upside down in the void.</p><p>Then, Mu Ling stood on top of the cauldron and withstood the supreme saint calamity on behalf of his disciple.</p><p>“Boom boom boom…”</p><p>Punch after punch, the fist light shattered into shadows.</p><p>Mu Ling’s body could not be considered strong, but at this moment, he was like the strongest physique cultivator.</p><p>The supreme saint calamity’s thunder calamity couldn’t kill him, but he was burned to pieces by the punches from the Dragon Melting Fire.</p><p>The thunder calamity that could not withstand it was swallowed by the power of the black sticky condensed flames..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
