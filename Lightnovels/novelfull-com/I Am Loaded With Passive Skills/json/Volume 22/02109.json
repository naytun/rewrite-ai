(3)</h1><p>Chapter 2109: An Inhumane Water Ghost! Inhumane Bai Lian! (3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio     Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“Hell!”</p><p>Water Ghost’s lips curled into a bigger sneer.</p><p>He knew that at such a close distance, Bai Lian could only maximize the output of his combat strength in order to protect himself.</p><p>However, he was so weak, and his control of power was so crude that Bai Lian’s self-defense seemed only to protect Water Ghost behind him. It was as if what he said was, “These are my people, even you, Dao Qiongcang, can’t touch them ”</p><p>As one of the five great authorities of the Holy Palace, Bai Lian was very often placed under public scrutiny and had long been thoroughly studied by others. Water Ghost was no exception.</p><p>His thoughts, combat strength, battle style, etc., Water Ghost knew Bai Lian like the back of his hand.</p><p>In the eyes of Water Ghost, Bai Lian was already a dead man, but he had spared his life.</p><p>Of course, Water Ghost had even more treacherous and inhumane methods.</p><p>For example, when Bai Lian defended and was about to succeed, he would use a small trick to temporarily connect with the Spell Forbidden Barrier on the Inner Island through the secondary plane door.</p><p>In an instant, all of Bai Lian’s spiritual sources were sealed.</p><p>No one would be able to tell, and there was no evidence…</p><p>Bai Lian, who had lost the power of a Spiritual Cultivator, would be killed by Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>Furthermore, the one who attacked was Dao Qiongcang. In order to prevent future problems, Bai Lian could not be resurrected!</p><p>If that was the case, Dao Qiongcang would definitely have a conflict with the</p><p>Holy Palace. It would be a grudge that would give Hallmaster Dao a headache.</p><p>With the Infernal lineage’s protective nature, Dao Qiongcang would definitely not have a good ending in the future.</p><p>Wherever you go, you would be attacked and there would always be obstacles in your way!</p><p>The Holy Palace might even use this as a leverage to exchange for Sleeveless. Then, the power of the Saint Servant would be established.</p><p>This was a flawless temporary plan that only required Bai Lian to be the sacrifice.</p><p>However, Water Ghost was still a human after all…</p><p>He knew that this was worse than killing Sleeveless.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, Mu Ling, Sang Qiye, Long Rongzhi, and the others weren’t fools. They wouldn’t let him off in the future.</p><p>He chose to give Bai Lian face and spare his life.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, oh Xu Xiaoshou, I’ve done you another favor. Unfortunately, you won’t appreciate it even if I tell you.”</p><p>Water Ghost lowered his head and his gaze was cold. He looked at Bai Lian who struggled hard and murmured quietly. “If only you weren’t Bai Lian.”</p><p>Saint Statue, Dragon Melting Realm, Heaven and Earth Oven…</p><p>When he stepped on the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, Xu Xiaoshou almost thought that Elder Sang had appeared when he saw the familiar fighting style of the Infernal lineage.</p><p>He quickly took a closer look.</p><p>Eh, no, was that his cheap junior brother who struggled and was on his deathbed?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost tapped Precious Dragon and wanted to go over to support him.</p><p>However, when he saw how Water Ghost protected Bai Lian at leisure and took the opportunity to undergo sanctification, he knew that Bai Lian was safe and would definitely not die!</p><p>Furthermore, Bai Lian had been together with Mu Ling on the Lone Cliff.</p><p>Judging by the character of the Infernal lineage, Mu Ling would not turn a blind eye to anything that happened to his disciple, as long as he was present.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Nine Heavens quaked, dark clouds gathered, black rain fell, and the saint calamity began.</p><p>At the same time, a deafening rumble sounded in the Desolate Inferno Domain.</p><p>Bai Lian was indeed worthy of being one of the five great authorities of the Holy Palace. His life-saving methods were extraordinary.</p><p>Under the restriction of Dragon Melting Realm and the Nine Dragons Burning the Ancestor Saint Statue, the Great Killing Technique had been greatly weakened. It was no longer something that human strength could not contend against.</p><p>The two streams of starlight were even treated as violent spirit medicine in the Dragon Melting Realm that Bai Lian regarded as the Heaven and Earth Oven.</p><p>“Burning Hands!”</p><p>Bai Lian only made a conducting alchemy hand seal. Then, he suddenly stretched out his hands. The nine Saint Statue dragons formed by the lava of the Desolate Inferno Domain pressed down from the sky to assist in the conducting alchemy move.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could tell that this was the technique of the ‘condensing method of infernal heavens’.</p><p>The Great Killing Technique was naturally not a spirit medicine, and it was impossible for it to really be condensed into elixirs.</p><p>However, under Bai Lian’s control that had the power of a demi-saint for a short period of time, the two had indeed shifted from their original positions. They rubbed against each other and seemed about to merge together.</p><p>It was impossible to fuse them together. In battle, the condensing method of infernal heavens was used to make it explode.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A loud explosion sounded. This clearly indicated that Dao Qiongcang’s Great Killing Technique had really been shattered by an Elixir Master below the demi-saint realm!</p><p>The divine light which seemed simple but was actually condensed with magnificent Holy Power, exploded with terrifying energy.</p><p>“Pfft…</p><p>With the protection of the Nine Dragons Burning the Ancestor, his body was strong.</p><p>Bai Lian couldn’t withstand it at all. His hands exploded and his body cracked.</p><p>Blood spurted out of his seven orifices as he fell backward.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>A golden pearl exploded on the half dressed Bai Lian.</p><p>“Bang! Bang!”</p><p>Bai Lian’s silver belt with dragon patterns and the exquisite jade pendant on it were completely shattered and turned into a stream of light.</p><p>“Weng weng weng…”</p><p>The jade stones and talismans that Bai Lian had gathered in the pocket of his sleeves broke one by one. They formed a spiritual source barrier that protected him from the second impact of the blast.</p><p>In his soul space, another drop of Holy Blood was drawn into his body.</p><p>Bai Lian’s almost dismembered body was quickly restored to its original state, and his pale and blood-stained face quickly regained its ruddy color.</p><p>He reeled back from the explosion.</p><p>By the time Bai Lian’s momentum was stopped by all sorts of defensive spiritual weapons, he stood in mid-air, straightened his back, and raised his head. Bai Lian’s condition had already been restored to eighty to ninety percent of what it was before the battle.</p><p>His face was filled with horror. He reached out and wiped the scabs off his face and revealed his fair and red skin that had just soaked in the lava bath. He said with lingering fear.</p><p>“Was this the attack of a demi-saint? How powerful….”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
