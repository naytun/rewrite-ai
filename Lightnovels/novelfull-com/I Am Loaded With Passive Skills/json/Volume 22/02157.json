(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>It was Bazhun’an!</p><p>They didn’t hear Bazhun’an’s murmurs, but they heard Hallmaster Dao’s voice.</p><p>Whether it should be said or not, they just wanted to see Hallmaster Dao’s expression and his words, ‘Lend me your Three-Foot Sword and watch me cut off all the worries in the world’.</p><p>Everyone was certain that this Bazhun’an was the real deal.</p><p>“He really came!”</p><p>“After Hallmaster Dao, even the Eighth Sword Deity had come to the island. Is he going to inherit the throne and stage another War of the Ten High Nobles?”</p><p>“Yunlun Tossed Treasure, Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict, deep sea turned the void, Water Ghost’s Upanishad… Bazhun’an was really well prepared!”</p><p>“But now, his enemy is Wangze Holy Emperor, not a demi-saint…That’s a real divine Holy Emperor, how would he fight him?”</p><p>Everyone felt the same about Bazhun’an. They all admired him greatly</p><p>He was indeed flawed. After all, he had suffered a defeat, and the price he paid was the loss of two fingers.</p><p>But how could a person be perfect?</p><p>No one could figure out the truth of the unknown battle that had taken place before and there were varied opinions.</p><p>It could be said that Bazhun’an’s flaws did not obscure the merits.</p><p>His life was a constant battle, and he had defeated countless enemies.</p><p>At this moment, even as the first-in-command saint servant, even the members of the Holy Divine Palace found it hard to feel disgusted.</p><p>He had a true temperament!</p><p>Water Ghost was strong, but he invoked varied feelings in people. He was very shrewd and his methods were complicated.</p><p>Moreover, his predecessor was Yu Mo. Anyone could guess that he had a special purpose to join the Saint Servant.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was strong too, but he had a thousand schemes and a thousand moves.</p><p>His strength was as mysterious as his Divine Secret. When he was in the game, no one noticed it, but the aftertaste was endless.</p><p>However, these people were just beating around the bush!</p><p>Bazhun’an was completely different. His methods were strong and direct, and so was he!</p><p>Perhaps some of his Saint Servants had ulterior motives, but based on him alone…</p><p>Everyone was willing to believe that Bazhun’an led the Saint Servants for the sake of the Struggle for the Great Path.</p><p>It was like the most direct combat method of ancient swordsman-pressure, resistance, and defeat.</p><p>That was all.</p><p>Therefore, when they looked at the calm figure in the spirit mirror, who walked over one step at a time.</p><p>The spectators could no longer stay calm. There was only one thought in their minds at this moment:</p><p>“The good show has begun!”</p><p>In the horizon, Rao Yaoyao landed beside Dao Qiongcang, but her gaze never left the figure outside the Forest of Miracles.</p><p>She only paused for a moment before her pretty face turned solemn and her red lips parted.</p><p>“I’ll go and kill him!”</p><p>In recent years, the Saint Servant had been the biggest thorn in the side of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>However, the first-in-command saint servant appeared and disappeared unpredictably. It was not until he was in the Eighth Palace that his identity was confirmed.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had wanted to fight Bazhun’an for more than thirty years!</p><p>She didn’t want to fight this Bazhun’an who looked weak at the moment. She would rather that they fought when both were in their peak condition.</p><p>However, since they were in the Holy Divine Palace, this was the best time to execute the beheading operation since Bazhun’an, who was in a bad state, was alone.</p><p>“No need.” Dao Qiongcang reached out to stop her.</p><p>“Why?” Rage flashed in Rao Yaoyao’s eyes. This was an opportunity that couldn’t be missed.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang shook his head. He did not want to explain at all. He only said, “It’s too late…”</p><p>It was indeed too late!</p><p>Bazhun’an’s appearance attracted everyone’s attention.</p><p>Even Wangze Holy Emperor who was in the Desolate Inferno Domain was diverted because of the sword cognition that slashed toward Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang himself had temporarily given up his resistance to the control of the Si Wu Formation when he was on the brink of death.</p><p>This was an open scheme!</p><p>Bazhun’an didn’t even need to make a move; he only used his ‘appearance’ to gain attention.</p><p>At that moment, the control of the Si Wu Formation was taken over by Xu Xiaoshou, who was one of the real owners of the battle.</p><p>“Lend me your three-foot sword and watch me cut off all the worries in the world…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered to himself as he stood above the Desolate Inferno Domain.</p><p>When he thought about how he had failed to act cool just now, and how Bazhun’an was so eye-catching, he sneered and rolled his eyes.</p><p>“Humph, showing off.”</p><p>The one who showed off is you Bazhun’an and even Dao Qiongcang was not as good.</p><p>He had only appeared and said a few words. He hadn’t even made a move, yet he had already attracted so many people’s attention.</p><p>If you had the Passive System, you would probably have leveled up to the maximum when you walked all the way from Tiansang Spirit Palace to Dongtianwang City.</p><p>He was filled with the desire to complain, but he didn’t forget about the important matter at hand.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had grasped the opportunity that was between life and death just now.</p><p>He stepped on the Art of Spiritual Array Disc and the Si Wu Formation was under his control again.</p><p>This time, the position of the array eye was extremely clear. It reflected the incantation in his heart and he was able to channel infinite profoundness. Xu Xiaoshou came back to his senses and shouted as he flew into the sky. “Rao Wangze, what are you looking at? I am your opponent!”</p><p>365 Void Suppression Stele, Nine Cores, plus the three treasures on him-Ember, white bead and Flame Python.</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou did not simply use the Si Wu Formation to summon the power of the Heavenly Ancestor.</p><p>Instead, it would become one of the array eye, become the Holy Light, and become a part of the Si Wu Formation!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>When everyone heard this roar, they all turned around.</p><p>When the Si Wu Formation was activated, Xu Xiaoshou was drowned in the holy light above the Desolate Inferno Domain. His Holy Emperor aura rose continuously as if there was no limit.</p><p>“He wants to undo the Si Wu Formation?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang held the divine Sinan in his hand and subconsciously wanted to destroy it. However, he stopped when he saw the figure outside the Forest of Miracles.</p><p>It was not only the Ming Yi.</p><p>The pressure that Bazhun’an gave him was also great.</p><p>A seemingly defeated person could use the cold Dark Iron Sword to slash out a spurt of sword energy.</p><p>If he were to target Xu Xiaoshou, what kind of retaliation would he get from</p><p>Bazhun’an?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
