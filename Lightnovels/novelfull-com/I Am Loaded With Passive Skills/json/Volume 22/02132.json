(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio     Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was stunned and hesitated for a moment.</p><p>“Divine Secret?”</p><p>The people below initially had an animated discussion and condemned Xu Xiaoshou’s outrageous remarks, but now they were also surprised.</p><p>“This Power Upanishad Formation looks familiar?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had many Power Upanishad Formations, but they were all fake!</p><p>This one belonged to the Divine Secret or rather, it was more like a Power Upanishad Formation of the Way of Spirit Array. It was rarely seen.</p><p>It was only after Xu Xiaoshou comprehended the divine insight and controlled the Divine Oracle that it was revealed. What was the reason for its appearance?</p><p>Everyone was suspicious.</p><p>“Art of Spiritual Array Disc!”</p><p>Above the sea of fire, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t offer any explanation. With the Unity of Man and the Heavens and the contract with the Art of Spiritual Array Disc, he was determined to break Dao Qiongcang’s trump card, that was Water Ghost.</p><p>He still could not replicate the Celestial Scroll and without the help of the divine Sinan, it would be very difficult to control the Si Wu Formation.</p><p>However, with the mighty power of the Holy Emperor as well as the Holy Emperor Lv.o Weaving Expertise and coupled with the fact that he had watched Dao Qiongcang’s Divine Thirty-Six Form many times before…</p><p>With his incredible memory, Xu Xiaoshou had already memorized all the techniques of the Divine Secret.</p><p>At this moment, he wanted to replicate it instantly and give Dao Qiongcang a shock!</p><p>“Divine Thirty-Six Form…”</p><p>The people below had wondered why Xu Xiaoshou displayed such a Power Upanishad Formation when they suddenly heard a familiar voice.</p><p>This voice clearly belonged to Hallmaster Dao. At this moment, it came from Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth!</p><p>“What did this mean?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou also knows Hallmaster Dao’s spells?”</p><p>“Impossible! Without the help of the Celestial Scroll and the divine Sinan, even Situ Yongren would not be able to derive at this kind of Divine Secret that directly pointed to the core of the Great Path, right?”</p><p>“But Xu Xiaoshou is Hallmaster Dao’s direct disciple!” Li Fugui’s eyes blazed with fervor.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was surprised when he heard Xu Xiaoshou’s voice, but he didn’t believe it and smiled.</p><p>“I have long heard of your ability to play tricks. It is not inferior to your Ancient Sword Technique…”</p><p>Weng!</p><p>Before he even finished talking, the Divine Path Principles surged and runic lights appeared.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stretched out his hand. On his palm, the Divine Path Principles weaved and formed an array wheel in the form of the divine Sinan.</p><p>With the appearance of this array wheel, it was as if he had replicated the Divine Thirty-Six Form!</p><p>“This?” Dao Qiongcang’s voice stopped abruptly, his eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had used the Drawing Expertise and the Weaving Expertise of the Art of Spiritual Array Disc, to create this one-time Divine Array Wheel.</p><p>His five fingers gathered together, and spiritual light leaped out and swept towards Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>“Great Stripping Technique!”</p><p>The entire island was shocked!</p><p>Everyone’s eyes followed the runes filled with the Divine Light Pattern. They couldn’t believe that Xu Xiaoshou could really replicate Hallmaster Dao’s spell.</p><p>If he could actually do it, wouldn’t he really be Hallmaster Dao’s personal disciple?</p><p>Did Plan Zero really exist?</p><p>“Something’s not quite right…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang didn’t want to use his body to put Xu Xiaoshou’s Divine Secret to the test. He spun the divine Sinan and tried to dodge it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had anticipated this and was well prepared.</p><p>“Heart Sword Technique, Demons Under Eyes!”</p><p>He aimed at Dao Qiongcang and watched from afar. He directed a powerful Spiritual Impact and tried to temporarily take control of Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>It was possible that Dao Qiongcang had entered the divine path and had a deep communication with the Great Path. On the path of cultivation, Dao Qiongcang did not nurse any inner demons.</p><p>When he faced the Demons Under Eyes, his performance was too perfect!</p><p>It was completely different from the way Mei Siren, Rao Yaoyao, and the others lost control when they first experienced the Heart Sword Technique. Dao Qiongcang regained control in an instant!</p><p>In the end, the reason why Xu Xiaoshou’s imagery of Demons Under Eyes was so strong was because he had targeted the ancient swordsman multiple times before.</p><p>The Gu Louying sword body was a powerful deterrent for the ancient swordsman.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang didn’t follow this formula nor did he have any inner demons.</p><p>Therefore, to him, the Demons Under Eyes was just an ordinary first realm Ancient Sword Technique.</p><p>He had experienced a lot of these during the War of the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>“Greater Teleportation! ”</p><p>The Celestial Scroll unfurled and Dao Qiongcang was instantly released from its control. He smiled and teleported away from under the Divine Light Pattern and did not take on Xu Xiaoshou’s attack.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled.</p><p>His voice rang out almost at the same time as Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>“Greater Teleportation!”</p><p>These two overlapping sounds echoed in the ears of the spectators below.</p><p>Everyone watched as Dao Qiongcang was sent away by the Great Stripping Technique. Xu Xiaoshou’s Divine Light Pattern could only hit an afterimage.</p><p>Suddenly, Dao Qiongcang was sent back!</p><p>This time, he couldn’t suppress the shock on his face. He even used his pure physical strength to receive Xu Xiaoshou’s Divine Light Pattern of the Great Stripping Technique.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou really knew the Divine Thirty-Six Form?!”</p><p>The ruins of the First Hall of Sins seemed to have exploded. Everyone held their heads as they felt the strongest impact.</p><p>They had witnessed how shocked Hallmaster Dao was, Xu Xiaoshou’s calmness and the figure that had been separated from Hallmaster Dao’s body by the Great Stripping Technique.</p><p>“Plop, plop…”</p><p>The sound of water gathered. Water Ghost held the golden beast mask and slowly pulled himself out of Dao Qiongcang’s body with an incredulous expression on his face.</p><p>His expression was even more shocked than when everyone first found out</p><p>that Yu Lingdi was Water Ghost!</p><p>Water Ghost extricated himself from the body.</p><p>The supreme saint calamity also split into two in the sky. One part locked onto Dao Qiongcang, while the other locked onto Water Ghost.</p><p>The separation of the saint calamity meant that the final-stage of the Great Stripping Technique had been completed! Water Ghost had really been forced out!</p><p>“What I just experienced…”</p><p>Water Ghost glanced at Dao Qiongcang, then at Xu Xiaoshou. He turned back and saw Rao Yaoyao, who stood in a daze in the distance. He lowered his head and saw the deathly silent First Hall of Sins.</p><p>He felt as if the world had been overturned!</p><p>“Plan Zero, really existed?”</p><p>At this moment, even Water Ghost couldn’t help but wonder if Xu Xiaoshou was truly Dao Qiongcang’s disciple and a spy from the Holy Divine Palace..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
