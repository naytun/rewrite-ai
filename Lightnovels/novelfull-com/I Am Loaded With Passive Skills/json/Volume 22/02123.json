(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“What should I do…”</p><p>“Yes, I must do something. I am now so strong that even Bazhun’an would have to kneel before me…</p><p>Unable to resist this power, Xu Xiaoshou chose to accept it. His blazing white eyes turned toward Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The void followed his gaze and a white burn mark appeared and seared the space.</p><p>“Oh my God…”</p><p>Bai Lian, who underwent his Nine Death Thunder Calamity Tribulation, witnessed this scene. His eyes that had already recovered, widened.</p><p>Infernal Heavens?</p><p>What level was this Infernal Heavens?</p><p>Was this still Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>With just a glance, when Xu Xiaoshou focused on his target, Dao Qiongcang’s body ignited into a spurt of white flame.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t use the Infernal Heavens at all, but everything was triggered by this spiritual technique.</p><p>“I can’t suppress the fire anymore!”</p><p>He roared and charged at Dao Qiongcang with his sword in hand, as if he had lost his mind.</p><p>At this moment, all the spectators could see the fear in Dao Qiongcang’s eyes.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, calm down. Protect me from the transcend the tribulation first!” Water Ghost’s voice came out in time, and it actually sounded a little shocked.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, don’t make a mistake. The power did not come from you, but it will come to an end. The Si Wu Formation is able to suppress everything on the Inner Island, but it can’t suppress you?” Dao Qiongcangs voice sounded at the same time.</p><p>“Roar!” The only response they received was a loud roar.</p><p>“Brother Yu MO!” Dao Qiongcang shouted in shock. “Do you know what to do?”</p><p>The Heavenly Ancestor’s power came from the Si Wu Formation and was being targeted. When he killed Water Ghost, Dao Qiongcang could leave behind a trace of his own consciousness.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lost all his reasoning when he received the power of a Holy Emperor that was even stronger than the power of a Heavenly Ancestor.</p><p>It was obvious that he would not hold back.</p><p>With such a strike, there was a high chance that Dao Qiongcang and Water</p><p>Ghost would be sent flying!</p><p>At that moment, Dao Qiongcang realized that he had no choice but to join forces with Water Ghost in order to save his life.</p><p>“I will remove your seal. In exchange, you will release me!” Water Ghost was smart and knew that it was time for the Saint Servant and the Holy Divine Palace to cooperate to fight against the madness.</p><p>Without a word, he lit up the secondary plane door in Dao Qiongcang’s body and temporarily stopped the influence of the Spell Forbidden Barrier on the Inner Island on Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang responded and felt the Holy Power in his energy reserve loosen. When Xu Xiaoshou’s sword came slashing over, a cracking sound came from the divine Sinan.</p><p>“Divine Thirty-Six Forms, Great Annihilation Technique!”</p><p>The Heavenly Secrets starlight flew over and directly dashed onto Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>However, Flame Python’s sword attack did not even have the slightest sword form. Xu Xiaoshou roared angrily and split the sword form into two.</p><p>The entire Abyss Island seemed to have fallen into dead silence and the only sound that could be heard was the rumble of thunder.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s Adam’s apple bobbed. While he was shocked, he finally found out where Xu Xiaoshou’s strength limit lay.</p><p>He knew that this move wouldn’t be able to stop the Holy Emperor Xu Xiaoshou, so he controlled the Si Wu Formation on Abyss Island during the attack.</p><p>365 spiritual lights and nine Saint pillars crisscrossed, as they moved the mountains and filled the seas.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s body suddenly exuded the power of the ancestral source. He could actually borrow the power of the Heavenly Ancestor!</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>He pointed.</p><p>With the enhancement of the Divine Path Principles, the power of the Heavenly Ancestor turned into a faint light that pointed at Xu Xiaoshou’s sword.</p><p>Kacha!</p><p>However, with a trembling sound, it only stopped Xu Xiaoshou for a moment before it was shattered.</p><p>Flame Python came face to face with it!</p><p>“Greater Teleportation.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang lowered his head. As he swiveled around, he disappeared in a flash and reappeared in the sky above the First Hall of Sins. A sense of fear lingered in his heart.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The entire Desolate Inferno Domain was shattered instantly by the Holy Emperor’s power.</p><p>The lava within a radius of ten thousand miles splattered under the rubble, but it was reduced to ashes by the power of the infernal power.</p><p>One strike.</p><p>One of the nine extreme grounds exploded!</p><p>In the ruins of the First Hall of Sins, everyone no longer needed to watch the battle through a spirit mirror.</p><p>They looked up and saw Dao Qiongcang engulfed by white flames above them.</p><p>At this moment, everyone was even more terrified of this than when they saw the Body of Decay.</p><p>“Don’t come over!”</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators scattered.</p><p>If Hallmaster Dao was here, then the crazy Holy Emperor Xu Xiaoshou should not be far away, right?</p><p>If he came and launched a strike, wouldn’t he be able to kill hundreds of Cutting Path and higher voids from the First Hall of Sins?</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao, you’re not a kind person!”</p><p>“Everyone, have you finally seen the true face of the Holy Divine Palace? Hallmaster Dao, this was a brilliant plan…</p><p>“What’s so wonderful, you fool, stop talking!”</p><p>The location of the supreme saint calamity shifted to the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who stood on the white sea of fire, turned his gaze to the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>The battlefield had suddenly shifted from the Desolate Inferno Domain to the ruins of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>“What powerful strength…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked violent, but he was actually very clear-headed.</p><p>He felt the power of the energy reserve of the Holy Emperor. He did not even step on the Space Dao Disc and only borrowed a bit of its power.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A white sea of fire that spanned tens of thousands of miles spread out in the sky above the ruins of the First Hall of Sins. Xu Xiaoshou teleported over and stood on top of it.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Everyone from the First Hall of Sins panicked.</p><p>However, no matter how these people tried their best, they still could not escape from the battlefield for a short period of time.</p><p>The Cutting Path, the higher void didn’t have the space attributes, teleportation, and escape techniques. All these traveling would take time.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou had the space attributes! He wanted to kill them all in just a breath’s time.</p><p>“Give up…”</p><p>After everyone realized something, they stopped their journey and looked up to watch the battle.</p><p>Whether they lived or not were not in their hands. They could only wait and see if the creator of the Saint war above could give them a chance.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, let me out!” After Water Ghost removed the restriction, he realized that Elder Dao the Flamboyant did not keep his promise and still imprisoned him in his body. He shouted angrily..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
