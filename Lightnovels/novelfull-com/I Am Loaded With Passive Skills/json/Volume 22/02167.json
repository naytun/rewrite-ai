(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“Basically… there had been no response…”</p><p>“No response? So what does that mean?”</p><p>When she saw Lan Ling’s red eyes, Yu Zhiwen couldn’t bear to look at her, so she looked away and said.</p><p>“The red-clothed people you mentioned should have followed Sword Deity Rao to the Lone Cliff. Therefore, they must have been swallowed up by the deep</p><p>sea…”</p><p>“I searched four times! However, the spirit mirrors that belonged to those names basically didn’t respond.”</p><p>“This means, it means… Yes, Senior Xin, Senior Heiming, and the others should be dead…”</p><p>All dead?</p><p>Lan Ling reeled back and almost fell.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen tried to soften the blow. She knew what this meant. She shook her head in disbelief. “That’s impossible!”</p><p>How could they be dead?</p><p>The last time the seal in the White Cave broke, a sealed ghost beast emerged. Everyone survived and didn’t die.</p><p>That was a seal attribute that had rarely been seen in hundreds of years.</p><p>They had guarded the White Cave for so many years, and the great danger had not killed the Night Guardian. How could they have died so easily in the Yunlun Mountain Range?</p><p>When she looked at Yu Zhiwen’s apologetic face, Lan Ling knew that it was probably true this time…</p><p>“Should?”</p><p>Lan Ling was like a drowning man who clutched at the last straw in desperation. She held Yu Zhiwen’s hand tightly and asked anxiously, “You just said ‘should’. So, there are some who are still alive?”</p><p>Weng!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s hand formed a seal and brought forth a completely dark spirit mirror.</p><p>“There’s only one left…” “Who is it?”</p><p>“Elder Night Guardian…”</p><p>Night Guardian? Lan Ling’s eyes lit up. Just as she was about to say something, Yu Zhiwen hurriedly said, “But!”</p><p>But?</p><p>Lan Ling was stunned.</p><p>Only then did Yu Zhiwen let out a sigh. She was at a loss for words at this moment, but she reached out and held Sister Lan Ling’s cold hands. “However, there is no content in the spirit mirror…”</p><p>“But don’t worry. This means that there’s a small chance that Elder Night Guardian is alive. He might have just been swallowed into the void… In Sky</p><p>City.”</p><p>That island that fell from the sky and almost crashed into Dongtianwang City?</p><p>Lan Ling tilted her head and looked in the direction of the Lone Cliff. “Sky City, is it dangerous?” She asked hopefully.</p><p>“It’s not dangerous! As long as we don’t fight for it, it won’t be dangerous…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen held Lan Ling’s hand tightly and said seriously, “Elder Night Guardian will be fine. There’s still Sword Deity Rao and the others. You have to believe in Sword Deity Rao.”</p><p>Yes, there was still Sword Deity Rao who was there to protect him!</p><p>We’re all the red-clothed people and we have Sword Deity Rao, the ruler of the red-clothed people. What am I afraid of?</p><p>Lan Ling revealed a bitter smile. To be able to save one was good.</p><p>Night Guardian, you’ll definitely be fine. We’ll definitely be able to meet again.</p><p>At this moment, a vast wave of air swept over from afar, and a terrifying aura descended from the sky.</p><p>“Pa, pa, pa…”</p><p>In front of the main seat of the spirit mirror, the Heaven Secrets Curtain shattered on the spot.</p><p>All the images in the spirit mirror were like paper and exploded into light spots in an instant.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen let out a sigh and fell from the sky. The jade talismans on her waist exploded one after another.</p><p>Lan Ling was also struck down by the terrifying aura.</p><p>However, she was not so lucky. Without the protection of treasures and spiritual energy, she was caught off guard. She was blasted into the underground mountain range with a bang. Flesh and blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>Everything happened so suddenly.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>Holy Emperor?</p><p>Why would the aura of a Holy Emperor suddenly descend?</p><p>Or did it just sweep over like this; it did not hurt her but blasted the unsuspecting Lan Ling into pieces?</p><p>Subconsciously, Yu Zhiwen wanted to rush down to save her.</p><p>However, the Holy Emperor’s aura was only the prelude. When it swept past, it shattered tens of thousands of mountains on the Yunlun Mountain Range.</p><p>Even the trial-takers were affected.</p><p>“Cloud Mirror, Protection!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s Pearl Gem Star Eyes suddenly lit up, and a vast amount of starlight surged from them.</p><p>She formed a hand seal and summoned the protective barrier from the Cloud Mirror world to protect most of the trial-takers before she rushed down.</p><p>Lan Ling had shattered…</p><p>It really wasn’t an illusion, she had really shattered!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s entire body trembled and the scene in front of her blurred.</p><p>However, she took a deep breath and forced herself to calm down. She took a drop of Lan Ling’s blood and triggered the divine secrets to summon the remnants.</p><p>Blood started to amass.</p><p>Bits of meat gathered.</p><p>Soon, Lan Ling was rapidly pieced together.</p><p>“I can save you!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen took out an Elixir and said, “I have this God’s Blessing. I can save you. Sister Lan Ling, you can’t give up…”</p><p>She fed her the Elixir.</p><p>The God’s Blessing of life and death, flesh and bones, summoned Lan Ling’s soul back and repaired her shattered body.</p><p>“Infernal…” When she opened her eyes, the first thing the weak Lan Ling said was not about herself, but said in great fear.</p><p>“It’s the White Cave. It’s the aura of the Infernal Hell Sea…</p><p>“They’re out!”</p><p>Infernal Hell Sea?</p><p>Was this the same thing that Sister Lan Ling had mentioned about the White Cave’s mutation earlier?</p><p>So fast?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s eyes were filled with panic.</p><p>The trial would only take half a day before it ended.</p><p>Everything would return to normal and everyone would be safe.</p><p>But suddenly…</p><p>How was that possible?</p><p>From the White Cave outside Tiansang Prefecture to Dongtianwang City.</p><p>There was clearly such a distance between them, and Lan Ling had just received the message. How could it be…</p><p>That’s right, this was a Holy Emperor.</p><p>They didn’t need time to travel.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen supported Lan Ling and was about to feed her more Elixirs when the aura of the Holy Emperor above her head suddenly turned violent, as if it wanted to shatter her.</p><p>The pearl on Yu Zhiwen’s body shattered with a snap.</p><p>She gritted her teeth and resisted the urge to kneel on the ground. She suddenly looked up.</p><p>“Whoa.”</p><p>The wind blew past.</p><p>A boundless white sea of fire swept across the sky..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
