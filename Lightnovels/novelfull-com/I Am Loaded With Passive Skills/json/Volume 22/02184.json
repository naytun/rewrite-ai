(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, how should we fight Seven Trees Emperor? I mean, if it’s the same this time, only a part of its power can escape.”</p><p>“Demi-saint versus a Holy Emperor… I can only say that regardless of the method, it would be very difficult.”</p><p>“There’s always a chance, isn’t there?”</p><p>“Rao… Well, let’s put it this way. Seven Trees Emperor is a person who has cultivated the power of guidance to the maximum limit. The easiest person for him to defeat would be a Spiritual Cultivator like you.”</p><p>“Oh? What do you mean?”</p><p>“Seven Trees Emperor is a blood tree, one of the Nine Great Ancestral Trees. Unlike the Ashvattha divine tree, that can separate the fruits of its power and form a heavenly flame, it is the only one.”</p><p>“I know that.’</p><p>“No, you only have a general idea. Your knowledge of the blood tree should be limited only to the ability of the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch.”</p><p>“Isn’t it just to stimulate one’s potential?”</p><p>“No. Seven Trees Emperor’s strongest ability is Guidance, not oppression. Just like Xu Xiaoshou, who seemed to have obtained something similar to the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch’s enhanced ability. His attack and defense speed had increased greatly, and his rationality had changed.”</p><p>“Should that not be the case?”</p><p>“That’s right. This is only the first ability of Seven Trees Emperor, Hunger!”</p><p>“Hunger?”</p><p>“Yes, to magnify the ‘hunger’ in one’s heart is actually a Guidance.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou’s hunger and thirst… was that a desire for power and hatred towards us? Then what’s next? There’s still six more levels. With his combat strength already at this level, can he get even more enhancements and be further strengthened?”</p><p>“The power of guidance of the Seven Trees Emperor is a path of no return. Once you walk on it, your will would not be able to withstand it and you will never wake up again.”</p><p>“So Xu Xiaoshou’s combat strength can still grow?!”</p><p>“Yes, from ‘hunger’ to ‘obsessive’, to ‘massacre’… Next, you will see Xu Xiaoshou’s layers of transformation under the the power of guidance of the Seven Trees Emperor.” “And after that?”</p><p>“Death!”</p><p>“Will Xu Xiaoshou die, or…</p><p>“This is the fourth level of the power of guidance. If he can’t resist it, he will die. If he dies, he would die on a large scale and recreate the scene of the Blood World. You should have seen this before.’</p><p>“Blood World…”</p><p>“After that, it will completely mutate. Even the Seven Trees Emperor would not be able to control it. It will start to ‘degenerate’ and turn ‘asexual’ until it becomes the final ‘nutrient’.</p><p>“This is the Blood Tree’s sevenfold Guidance?”</p><p>“Yes, didn’t you want to fight? Only when you understand these things would you have a chance to win and at least have some hope… And my advice is that if you really want to face him, it’s best if you don’t even get hit by the first layer of the power of guidance.” “There’s no turning back?”</p><p>“It’s good that you are aware.”</p><p>“What about the Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison? It’s also the Third Ancestor of the White Vein. You didn’t tell me about this before.’</p><p>“You weren’t a demi-saint before. Once you came into contact with the Saint secret, you would soon forget it.”</p><p>“Then tell me about the Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison.”</p><p>“I don’t know much about this either. I only know that its age is no less than the Nine Great Ancestral Trees. It’s at the peak of its suppressive force.”</p><p>“It’s like a prison…”</p><p>“It’s not just like a prison, it is really one! The true form of the Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison should be a corner of the Divine Prison from an unknown world. As long as you’re caught by it, even a Holy Emperor can be suppressed.”</p><p>“If it is so powerful, why is it still on the Inner Island?”</p><p>“Ha, even demi-saints need to imprison themselves. The rules of the Shengshen Continent do not accept the Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison. If it entered forcefully, it will be rejected by the rules. At that time, the five Holy Emperors can easily divide its power.”</p><p>“In that case…”</p><p>“That’s right. It’s the only one who stayed voluntarily at the Inner Island of the</p><p>Abyss Island. However, if there’s a chance, it would like to get out.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou should be its chance?”</p><p>“That should be the understanding! It was a harmless attempt. The failure was expected, but the success was unexpected.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had this conversation with Dao Qiongcang the moment Xu Xiaoshou and Wangze Holy Emperor fought in the ruins of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>In fact, when she heard about the secrets of the Holy Emperor, she was extremely shocked.</p><p>She had been a member of the Council of Ten, and she was even the Ruler of the red-clothed people.</p><p>However, if she hadn’t entered the Saint realm, she wouldn’t have come into contact with the true elites.</p><p>Even the ghost beasts they faced were all basically demi-saints.</p><p>Moreover, the demi-saint ghost beasts were usually killed by the demi-saints on the Saint mountain. Once it was confirmed that there were no accidents, the battlefield would be cleaned up.</p><p>This was also one of the reasons why Rao Yaoyao was so shocked when she first saw the ghost beasts on the Inner Island.</p><p>She had never seen most of the ghost beasts who were above the demi-saint level. She only knew a little about them from the information books.</p><p>As for the Holy Emperor…</p><p>Before this, even if someone had told her about the higher void, she would have forgotten about it very quickly, let alone being involved.</p><p>Now that she understood, Rao Yaoyao had a different feeling when she looked at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>There were four types of terrifying Holy Emperor power that had gathered on him!</p><p>Apart from the strange and difficult Seven Trees Emperor and the Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison, there was also the Great Infernal Ancestor and the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>With such a combination of power, could Wangze Holy Emperor’s thought incarnation really withstand it?</p><p>As these thoughts flashed through her mind, the situation in the battle had already taken a turn for the worse.</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor had been beaten, controlled, stabbed, and swallowed…</p><p>The power that Xu Xiaoshou displayed was exactly like what Dao Qiongcang had said, from hunger and thirst to obsession and then to slaughter.</p><p>The Frost Ferret helped in the last attack. That move was clearly the ability of the Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison.</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor had been swallowed!</p><p>It was only now that Rao Yaoyao felt a sense of urgency from her identity as an outsider who had nothing to do..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
