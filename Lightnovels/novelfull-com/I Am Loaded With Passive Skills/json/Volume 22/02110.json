(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“How excessive!”</p><p>Almost everyone who used their own methods to view how Bai Lian survived this attack felt very envious.</p><p>What was the gap between the rich and the poor? What was the disparity in status? Today, they finally witnessed it.</p><p>In terms of cultivation level, the Spiritual Cultivation of at least half of the people on the island were no weaker than Bai Lian’s.</p><p>However, there were only a handful of people who had the confidence to withstand Dao Qiongcang’s attack.</p><p>However, Bai Lian didn’t even need to exert much strength. He blocked the demi-saint’s killing blow with just an external item.</p><p>“D*mn it, these status dogs!”</p><p>“Bai Lian is finished, he is definitely finished. Regardless whether he was in an alliance with the Saint Servant or not, when he took the attack for Water Ghost, Hallmaster Dao would not let him off.’</p><p>“Yes, not to mention the Holy Palace’s betrayal, at least the Infernal lineage, or Bai Lian himself was certainly a traitor. He should be killed.”</p><p>“He really should be killed! No matter what the reason was… He’d dead meat now!”</p><p>“Eh, what a sour smell. Where did it come from?” Li Fugui looked around and sniffed.</p><p>“But didn’t you notice that Water Ghost already had a contract with the semi-saint person? If he really underwent sanctification, Hallmaster Dao would have lost half the game already!”</p><p>Amidst the ‘sour grapes’ discussion, it was rare to find any clear-headed person.</p><p>Indeed, the force of the explosion of the condensing method of infernal heavens was too grand, so much so that Water Ghost, who had a secret contract with the semi-saint person became inconspicuous.</p><p>However, the thunder calamity had already occurred, and the situation had changed. It was time for the sanctification.</p><p>The saint calamity had began to brew and was about to fall.</p><p>If it was someone else, they might think that the success rate of the sanctification would be about 50 – 50, or even 30 – 70.</p><p>But this was Water Ghost!</p><p>He had planned such a big show on Abyss Island, and he was also a master of the Water-type Upanishad. Although Water Ghost’s saint calamity was stronger than ordinary people’s, how could he not pass it?</p><p>Once he underwent sanctification, he would be the first Water-type Upanishad demi-saint. He would instantly be the best in his time.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was strong and he had the Celestial Scroll.</p><p>However, even the Celestial Scroll was a replica of the Power Upanishad Formation. How could a pirated copy be better than the original?</p><p>How could Dao Qiongcang be stronger than the demi-saint Water Ghost, who had walked the orthodox path of the Spiritual Cultivation to the extreme?</p><p>He had not thought about it, but he was shocked when he did.</p><p>Only then did everyone realize why Dao Qiongcang had tried to stop Water Ghost’s sanctification.</p><p>When Water Ghost really became a demi-saint, the influence of the layout, the general situation, the geographical location, and human factors would be set aside.</p><p>In a direct confrontation, he had the qualifications to challenge any demi-saint in the world, even the well known Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>“Good plan!”</p><p>On the dragon’s head, Xu Xiaoshou also saw through this.</p><p>Under the Absolute Power, any arrangement was like paper. As long as Dao Qiongcang turned up, he could destroy everything.</p><p>However, if the person who set this up also had Absolute Power, then it would be too terrifying.</p><p>If you can’t play dirty, you’ll be beaten up even if you come out in the open. How hopeless would that be?</p><p>“But is that all that Dao Qiongcang has…” Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself as he sized up Hallmaster Dao who was still so calm in the face of danger, as if everything was still under control.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The saint calamity finally formed.</p><p>The dark clouds in the sky were even more oppressive than the previous sanctification phenomenon. They covered more than half of Abyss Island.</p><p>The energy contained in the calamity clouds was even more terrifying. Just a mere glance would strike fear in one’s heart.</p><p>Such a powerful saint calamity- it would probably be difficult for an ordinary higher void level to even withstand the first few thunder calamity.</p><p>“What kind of saint calamity is this? It’s too terrifying!” A higher void said in a voice that trembled in fear.</p><p>“There are a total of 129,600 calamities in the supreme saint calamity. From the beginning, there would be one calamity plus one thunder and it would kick off with the purple divine thunder…” Li Fugui shook his head and muttered to himself. He was also shocked by this rare saint calamity.</p><p>“Supreme saint calamity? Big brother, tell me more. How was this different from an ordinary saint calamity? Some Cutting Path approached him.</p><p>“The ordinary saint calamity has a buffer period, but there are no breaks in the supreme saint calamity. The main purpose is to split a person to death.”</p><p>“It’s also the most precious saint calamity. In the early stages, it can destroy 90% of the higher void and in the middle and late-stage, it can kill ordinary demi-saints.”</p><p>Li Fugui took a deep breath. “The number of supreme saint calamities that had been recorded in the history of the Shengshen Continent can be counted on two hands.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t Water Ghost die for sure? Hallmaster Dao doesn’t even need to make a move?” More people gathered around, amazed by the information from Li Fugui.</p><p>“No.” Li Fugui shook his head slowly.</p><p>“The appearance of this supreme saint calamity proved that Water Ghost’s foundation is as profound as his deep sea. Others might not be able to survive it, but he…”</p><p>Li Fugui’s scalp went numb when he thought about the power of the Upanishad and the demi-saint Spiritual Cultivator who in his impression hadn’t even mastered the power of the Upanishad.</p><p>“As long as he takes out his Holy Emperor person, he might even be able to make a breakthrough to that level!”</p><p>It meant…</p><p>Holy Emperor State?</p><p>These words came as a shock!</p><p>“Big brother, are you joking? How could Water Ghost have the status of a</p><p>Saint… ” Someone sneered, and many people immediately echoed his words.</p><p>His higher void Upanishad hadn’t reached the peak yet. Even a demi-saint looked down on him.</p><p>A demi-saint Upanishad had reached the final-stage. He could look down on all the lower demi-saints.</p><p>If it was a Holy Emperor Upanishad…</p><p>Would this not be going against the Heavens?</p><p>“Who knows?” Li Fugui sighed faintly.</p><p>Water Ghost’s heart was the needle at the bottom of the seabed. His predecessor was the Great Demon King Yu Mo. He became famous thirty to forty years ago and had a profound foundation.</p><p>Li Fugui felt that he would understand even if he produced a Holy Emperor person when he transcended the tribulation.</p><p>This was because what Water Ghost did on Abyss Island was already going against the will of Heaven..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
