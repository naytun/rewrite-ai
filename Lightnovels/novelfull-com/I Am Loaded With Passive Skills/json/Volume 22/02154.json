(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Water Ghost knew about Patriarch Wuji from the Inner Island.</p><p>Or rather, he had seen Patriarch Wuji’s host body – Liu Changqing.</p><p>Abyss Island floated about in the cracks of time and space all year round and rarely made an appearance. Before it descended on the Shengshen Continent, there was a rumor:</p><p>Somebody accidentally entered Abyss Island and broke off the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch at the Blood World. However, he was haunted by the ghost beasts and sought help.</p><p>That person was Liu Changqing.</p><p>His first method to save himself was coincidentally to go to the Spirit Gem Trade Fair. He almost exposed his identity when he wanted to trade in the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch in return for information on the ghost beast.</p><p>What was coincidental was that his appearance not only destroyed the information blockade the Holy Divine Palace had on Sky City but there had been information passed via word of mouth by the people in the highest Land</p><p>Realm in Dongtianwang City. It was indirectly confirmed that the existence of Sky City was not a paradise.</p><p>And what made it even more coincidental was that the power behind the Spirit Gem Trade Fair was Night Cat, and Night Cat’s boss was the Saint Servant Water Ghost.</p><p>It was flawless!</p><p>Liu Changqing thought so. After all, his self-rescue method had saved his life. It was perfect!</p><p>Patriarch Wuji felt the same way. He had completed his first meeting after he came out.</p><p>After the trade fair ended, Liu Changqing disappeared for a few days.</p><p>Well, Xu Xiaoshou’s presence was just an unforeseen circumstance. Water Ghost was the trump card that had been set on the Inner Island!</p><p>It was also during that time…</p><p>Water Ghost was aware of all the plans for the operation on Abyss Island.</p><p>When he faced Xu Xiaoshou and Mei Siren’s doubtful gazes, Water Ghost felt anxious and quickly said.</p><p>“There’s the secondary plane door, the deep sea Spell Forbidden Barrier, and the void gate that used the sacrificial technique… These were not enough to connect with Abyss Island.”</p><p>“The incantation is the key!”</p><p>“That is a Divine Secret incantation. It borrowed the two powers mentioned</p><p>above. It also required a Saint Stage Divine Array to be set up on Abyss Island and outside the void gate, so the incantation can be complete.”</p><p>“Patriarch Wuji had just come out. He doesn’t have enough strength, energy, and time to set up the array. He also had to maintain the array on both sides at the same time…”</p><p>“It just so happened that we have a temporary replacement, so we finally chose a matching Power Upanishad Formation.” Xu Xiaoshou was enlightened.</p><p>Was that the reason why you used your son?</p><p>Water Ghost did not dwell on the small details and he did not even ask. He continued.</p><p>“There are two worlds between them, and there is a way to communicate with each other. Water can cross water, and the path is eternal.”</p><p>“The return of the path technique, the unification of the void, the overturning of the sea and the sky, the Upanishad as the foundation.”</p><p>Water Ghost paused and seemed to be in a daze as he took out an array wheel.</p><p>“This is the incantation and the Divine Array Wheel that Patriarch Wuji gave me.”</p><p>“The function of the incantation is to activate the array wheel and connect with everything in the deep sea and then open up a passageway to Abyss Island.”</p><p>“However, I do not know what effect this incantation will have on you in this place…”</p><p>After he said that, he looked at the Communication Talisman in Xu Xiaoshou’s hand. “Bazhun’an, it’s your turn to explain.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered the incantation silently and was deep in thought.</p><p>Thus, the Divine Array Wheel used the power of the Power Upanishad Formation to open up a passage.</p><p>This was the reason why Patriarch Wuji was so highly valued in the Inner Island and was released ahead of time for this operation?</p><p>However, after he recited it once, he still didn’t understand how this incantation would help him, so he lowered his head.</p><p>The Communication Talisman flickered and Bazhun’an’s voice rang out.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, do you know the Divine Secret?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“That’s good. You can ignore my array wheel. Do it yourself!” What did he mean?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned and Bazhun’an’s voice sounded again.</p><p>“The incantation that Xuan Wuji gave you should have two parts. What about the rest?”</p><p>Behind him…</p><p>Water Ghost quickly glanced behind him.</p><p>He did not have the time to think about the meaning of Bazhun’an’s words</p><p>from the perspective of a chess player due to the pressure of the Holy Emperor’s imminent arrival.</p><p>He was completely reduced to being only a chess piece. He only cared about the second half of the incantation that he did not understand at all and had almost forgotten.</p><p>“The dimensions are separated, and the couplet is flipped in the mirror. Fire will cross fire, and the seal cannot be broken.’</p><p>“Seal Breaking Secret Art, Holy Bead to Acupoint, Flame Sword Connection, and Ember Illumination as a Covenant.”</p><p>After he recited these two sentences, Water Ghost’s mouth opened slightly and he could not close it.</p><p>At the end of the Spirit Gem Trade Fair, he still didn’t understand the meaning of the second half of the incantation.</p><p>Now, when he repeated it, he found it had many familiar points.</p><p>“Fire, Flame Sword, Ember Illumination…”</p><p>Wasn’t this a reference to Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>After he heard the second half of the incantation, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes widened. “What?” He looked at Water Ghost in shock. “When did this incantation come about?”</p><p>Water Ghost was also surprised, “The Spirit Gem Trade Fair…”</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, the Communication Talisman lit up again and Bazhun’an’s voice sounded.</p><p>“White Cave.”</p><p>F*ck!</p><p>White Cave, you wanted to set me up on Abyss Island?</p><p>No wonder you thought that I had not done enough in the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was so frightened that he wished he could tear apart the Communication Talisman and stab Bazhun’an with his sword.</p><p>The latter half of the story…</p><p>No matter how stupid he was, he could sense that something was wrong when he combined it with the way Water Ghost summoned Abyss Island.</p><p>Previously, it was the deep sea void gate, the Outer Island of Abyss Island, and the two Water-type Upanishad that formed the array for the Divine Secret passage.</p><p>Now, he was on the Desolate Inferno Domain on the Inner Island of the Abyss Island. If he didn’t have any Fire Upanishad, he would use Flame Python, Ember Heart and the Infernal lineage?</p><p>“Holy Bead…”</p><p>“Wasn’t that the freaking white bead?”</p><p>As soon as he got close to the Desolate Inferno Domain, not only did Flame Python move, but Ember Heart also moved as well as the white bead in his body.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally understood why these strange movements had taken place.</p><p>He also understood now, why Flame Python provided the guidance for him toward the direction of the Desolate Inferno Domain the moment he stepped onto Abyss Island..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
