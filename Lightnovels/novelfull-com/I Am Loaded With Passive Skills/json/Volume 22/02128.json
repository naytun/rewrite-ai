He could feel the surging Holy Emperor’s power from the distance. He cursed, but his tone was filled with worry.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, who did you learn this from? You’re spouting such nonsense and care nothing about your reputation. If word gets out, won’t your reputation be tarnished?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is just a child. He can’t tell right from wrong. Who dares to teach him this?”</p><p>“Also, how can such a small child receive the power of a Holy Emperor so recklessly?”</p><p>“Was he courting for death, or was someone forcing him?”</p><p>Mei Siren squinted at Bazhun’an and got angrier as he spoke. He stomped on a tree stump, and splinters flew.</p><p>He pointed his folding fan angrily at the Abyss. “Don’t let me catch him.</p><p>Otherwise, I’ll teach him a lesson!”</p><p>Bazhun’an stared at him. He wanted to keep silent.</p><p>However, when he saw the broken wooden stake, he could only sigh. He said helplessly, “No one taught him this. I’ve only met him a few times.”</p><p>“Did I say it was you?” Mei Siren turned around angrily. “You said no one taught him, but is there really someone who was born knowing?”</p><p>“Maybe?” Since he knew that this tiger was angry, he didn’t stroke its beard. As someone who still respects his seniors, Bazhun’an purposefully avoided the anger of the old man.</p><p>“It’s best if he’s really born with knowledge. Don’t let this old man know who led him astray!” Mei Siren glared at Bazhun’an and sighed, “But it’s true. Who in the world would be so heartless?”</p><p>“A vicious tiger doesn’t eat its cubs. If whoever it was has the intention to make use of the younger generation, it’s not too much to kill them with five lightning strikes. Not to mention cultivating the seedlings and helping them grow, it’s imperceptible to make them grow like spring breeze and rain.”</p><p>After pausing for a while, Mei Siren grabbed his folding fan. His gaze was like a sword as he looked back. “Does my words make sense?”</p><p>Bazhun’an opened his mouth, but he did not dare to agree. “There is indeed a little logic in them…”</p><p>“Only a little?” Mei Siren blew his beard and glared.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is not an ordinary person. The infusion of the Holy Emperor’s power is not to spoil the seedlings, nor will it damage his foundational roots. Instead, it will allow him to familiarize himself with this power in advance…”</p><p>“Oh? You mean you want him to aim too high, and who are you trying to absolve by not damaging his foundational roots? Do you think his condition is stable now?” Mei Siren pointed at the air.</p><p>Bazhun’an looked up, but his turbid eyes couldn’t see that far. He could only see a white flame in the distance.</p><p>“I can’t see. My Spiritual Cultivation is only at the third realm….”</p><p>Mei Siren was so angry that he waved his folding fan.</p><p>Rotten wood can’t be carved!</p><p>“In my opinion, he learned it from you!”</p><p>Mei Siren quickly waved his fan. He had almost wanted to carve out the words on the fan and embed them into the eyes of Bazhun’an.</p><p>“I can’t admit that. I didn’t teach him that. If you say that it was Sang Qiye who taught him, then it’s fine.”</p><p>“Heh, even if you didn’t teach him, do you think he will not learn from your example?” Mei Siren sneered.</p><p>“The way of education does not necessarily require direct verbal instruction.” “Who was the first to raise the flag on the wrong path?”</p><p>“Later on, when the young people were still unclear about the concept of right and wrong, wouldn’t they easily go astray if they followed the flag to the wrong path?”</p><p>Hearing this, Bazhun’an frowned, “Master Siren, what are you talking about?” “Who do you think he looks like now?” Mei Siren closed his fan and pointed.</p><p>The Abyss Holy Emperor’s power swept over as savage voices sounded from afar.</p><p>What ‘Insignificant individuals, being noisy’…</p><p>What ‘How dare you provoke me? You’re disrespecting the invincible’…</p><p>All magnified!</p><p>Bazhun’an was rather happy when he heard this. He couldn’t help but recall the scene when he was young and frivolous, traveling the world with Wen Ting.</p><p>Soon, his smile froze.</p><p>“Master Siren, if you have anything to say, let’s be direct about it. There’s no need to beat around the bush.”</p><p>“Good! Then I’ll tell you clearly. If he didn’t learn it from you, who did he learn it from?”</p><p>“I’ve never taught him…” Bazhun’an paused, realizing that his path had been blocked. Why did he need to preach the path of enlightenment face to face?</p><p>“Humph!” The old Sword Saint snorted and changed the topic. “If something happens to him, who will be responsible?”</p><p>“Can you take the responsibility?” Mei Siren interrupted him. He was fully prepared for this answer.</p><p>“You want to nurture another you?”</p><p>“Three breaths for the innate stage, three years for Sword Deity, thirty years of silence, and now that they returned, continue with the Acquired Stage of Spiritual Cultivation?”</p><p>When Bazhun’an heard this, his eyes flashed coldly.</p><p>These words were too sharp. It was no different from tearing open his scar and sprinkling salt on it!</p><p>However, this ancient swordsman was a straightforward person. The gentle Mei Siren had already given him enough face by beating around the bush for so long.</p><p>He was the one who requested him to get straight to the point.</p><p>This time, the old man was extremely direct. It seemed that Bazhun’an couldn’t blame the old Sword Saint.</p><p>Bazhun’an remained silent.</p><p>The only “failure” in his life could not be explained, and there was no need to explain it.</p><p>Seeing Bazhun’an’s silence, Mei Siren’s eyes flashed with pity.</p><p>However, he did not regret saying this.</p><p>He was no longer looking at the present but at the future of Xu Xiaoshou, who was showing off his abilities.</p><p>If even he didn’t dare to speak up, who else in the world would dare to speak up for Xu Xiaoshou in front of the Bazhun’an?</p><p>“Master Siren, don’t worry. I will protect him.” Bazhun’an broke the silence. There was no guarantee or oath. It was just a simple sentence.</p><p>Mei Siren took a deep look at him and moved his gaze away. He took a few steps forward, leaving behind his back. His sharp mouth was unforgiving, “Even You Tu couldn’t protect you..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
