(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The Celestial Scroll in the sky rolled up at the right time. Rao Yaoyao’s afterimage disappeared, and Xu Xiaoshou’s explosion seemed rather forlorn.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang! l”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was completely enraged.</p><p>Things were different now. Water Ghost was no longer in Elder Dao the Flamboyant’s body.</p><p>Were Dao Qiongcang’s actions merely to attract his hatred and did he seek his own death?</p><p>“I gave you a chance. If I didn’t make a move on you first, why would you seek trouble?”</p><p>Within the Dragon Melting Realm, everything is mine!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned and saw the Sleeping Valley from the Azure Marsh.</p><p>It was a strange Land Realm, surrounded by stone mountains. The Stone Giants were awake, but they laid on their backs and trembled.</p><p>“All living things have spirits, and they are afraid of me. How can you not be afraid of me, Dao Qiongcang?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took out the Imitator with a flip of his hand. As soon as he held it, his body began to transform.</p><p>His golden curly hair changed and wrinkles appeared on the left side of his face. He soon turned into the light of spiritual cultivation, Yan Wuse.</p><p>However, when the mutation was halfway through, half of Xu Xiaoshou turned into Yan Wuse while the other half became a white flame. He used the Transformation to control the Imitator’s mutation.</p><p>Half Yan Wuse, half Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>Half was the light of the spiritual cultivation and the other half was the ultimate flame!</p><p>“Light.”</p><p>He uttered one word.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned into a white flame and stepped on the sea of fire with his sleeveless fist. He flashed into the Sleeping Valley.</p><p>The white flame descended, and the Ice Lotus flourished.</p><p>His killing intent filled the air and his face was like the God of War.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had just resolved Rao Yaoyao’s predicament with one strike when Xu Xiaoshou suddenly appeared.</p><p>This speed was so fast that even he almost could not react in time.</p><p>Light?</p><p>Light of spiritual cultivation?</p><p>That’s right, in the data collected by Xiao Qi, Xu Xiaoshou took Yi’s Imitator and Yan Wuse’s blood.</p><p>Otherwise, even if he possessed the power of a Holy Emperor, even if he used the ‘take the easy way out’ tactic, if he wanted to teleport from the Azure Marsh to the Sleeping Valley, he would have to do it a few times.</p><p>And these multiple teleportation gave him a chance to catch his breath.</p><p>He had never thought that while he took a breather, he would be struck by the light of spiritual cultivation!</p><p>Yan Wuse, you’ve done a lot of harm!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I’ll…</p><p>Just as Dao Qiongcang opened his mouth, Xu Xiaoshou angrily punched him and interrupted.</p><p>“Don’t try to persuade me. You can persuade the world with your words, but it would not work on me, Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Fast!</p><p>It was too fast!</p><p>It happened in a hair’s breadth and Dao Qiongcang couldn’t say anything else. The Celestial Scroll under his feet flashed again, and the divine Sinan moved at the same time.</p><p>“Slow!”</p><p>“You’re too slow!”</p><p>The Holy Emperor’s Agility allowed Xu Xiaoshou to react extremely quickly in close combat.</p><p>He was like an emotionless battle puppet… No, the Divine Oracle deliberately displayed a flaw that was ‘just a hair’s breadth away’.</p><p>As expected, Dao Qiongcang’s movements slowed down a little when he had this breather and thought that there would be time.</p><p>“But how can you be so naive as to think that you had the chance to resist?” Berserk Giant!</p><p>The golden light exploded with a loud bang and completely shattered that small gap brought about by Xu Xiaoshou’s giant transformation.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s Celestial Scroll was only half released and his hair stood on end. He had a premonition of the imminent danger.</p><p>But it was too late!</p><p>The distance that Xu Xiaoshou held was exactly half the distance between his fist and Dao Qiongcang’s body after he transformed into the Berserk Giant!</p><p>He had just completed his transformation, but Dao Qiongcang had already transformed, and his body was contorted by the attack.</p><p>“Scram!”</p><p>With a bang, a heavy fist swept across, and flames rose to the sky.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s divine Sinan flew up and was thrown into the air without any</p><p>tangible form. Layer after layer of holy weapons exploded in the air.</p><p>His figure broke through the space and returned from the black hole.</p><p>Just like how Yan Wuse had traveled ten miles in an instant, he was blasted back to the First Hall of Sins from the Sleeping Valley.</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>A mouthful of blood splattered all over the First Hall of Sins and was evaporated by the high temperature of the Dragon Melting Realm.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s body was covered in blood scabs. He had been torn apart by the compressed fire lines of the Dragon Melting Realm, and his appearance was no longer noble and dignified.</p><p>The entire place was deathly silent.</p><p>On the ruins of the First Hall of Sins, the crowd watched as Hallmaster Dao flew over in a miserable manner and spurted out blood. Their eyelids twitched non-stop.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had sent Hallmaster Dao flying with a punch after he sent Yan Wuse flying with a punch?</p><p>This attack completely caught him off guard.</p><p>If Hallmaster Dao didn’t have that jade pendant, golden beads, necklace, and ring…</p><p>With his Divine Sorcerer’s frail physique, if he was struck by such a careless attack, wouldn’t he end up like Elder Yan back then? His body would be shattered and he would not be able to recover?</p><p>“God’s wrath.”</p><p>“Holy Emperor Xu Xiao… Shou had gone crazy!”</p><p>“He even dared to beat up Hallmaster Dao. Is there anything in this world that he doesn’t dare to do?”</p><p>“With this punch, his potential had been fully displayed. It’s as if I can see a</p><p>Godhood called a god at the gates of hell in the War of the Ten High Nobles.”</p><p>“Thousands of defenses, but you did not guard against the giant. Pfft… Uh, Hallmaster Dao, you were too careless!”</p><p>Under the supreme saint calamity, Water Ghost had no intention to transcend the tribulation at all. His attention was completely focused on the battle.</p><p>He was stunned by Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>One against two, although he let Rao Yaoyao go, he sent Dao Qiongcang flying!</p><p>Did Xu Xiaoshou plan this diversion?</p><p>When he looked at the Berserk Giant whose arms were also scorched after the golden light hit Dao Qiongcang, Water Ghost suddenly felt that the Water-type Upanishad was a bit boring.</p><p>What kind of spiritual technique did he have to be able to hit Elder Dao the Flamboyant?</p><p>Water Ghost also wanted to punch Dao Qiongcang and smash his face.</p><p>“Brat, you ruined my Dao heart…”</p><p>As he took a deep breath, Water Ghost acknowledged Xu Xiaoshou’s abnormal combat strength and chose to transcend the tribulation in peace.</p><p>He knew that the power of the Holy Emperor would come to an end.</p><p>As long as Dao Qiongcang and Rao Yaoyao didn’t die in one strike, Xu Xiaoshou would eventually be dragged down if he delayed any longer..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
