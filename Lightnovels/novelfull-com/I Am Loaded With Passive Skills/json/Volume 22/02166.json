(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Dongtianwang City and the Yunlun Mountain Range.</p><p>The Imperial City Trial had reached its final stages.</p><p>Without external interference, the ultimate trial on Pixiu Mountain became clear as day.</p><p>Since the day Sky City descended upon Lone Cliff, the Imperial City Trial had become remarkably peaceful.</p><p>All stowaways and troublemakers were irresistibly drawn to the “Foundational Roots of Saint Ascension.</p><p>As a result, the Yunlun Mountain Range returned to its normal trial routine of the Innate and Master stages.</p><p>In the void, under the Heaven Secrets Curtain, before the main spirit mirror in the Yun Mirror World, Yu Zhiwen rested her chin on her hand, stifled a yawn, and listlessly stared at the spirit mirror images.</p><p>She had been watching for many days!</p><p>But ever since Young Master Xu became well-behaved and stopped causing trouble, the Imperial City Trial returned to normal, free from chaos.</p><p>This surveillance job lost its novelty and excitement, although this was supposed to be the norm.</p><p>“Hmm, clearly a fake person…”</p><p>“But where is he now? Did he also go to Abyss Island? Many stowaways have entered… ”</p><p>In the ever-shifting scenes of the Spirit Mirror, Yu Zhiwen paid no attention to the Imperial City Trial, nor to a certain Young Master Xu, who was obviously fake.</p><p>After all, the trial would end today, and her thoughts drifted elsewhere, pondering about some uncertain matters.</p><p>For example, whether she should go to Abyss Island and take a look once everything was over…</p><p>At that moment, the Heaven Secrets Communication Bead trembled.</p><p>Simultaneously, outside the Heaven Secrets Curtain that hid and protected her, there was a disturbance, as if someone had arrived.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s long eyelashes fluttered, and her starry eyes blinked a few times. After coming back to her senses, she quickly grabbed the communication bead and lowered her voice:</p><p>“What’s the matter?”</p><p>After feigning an authoritative tone, she saw that the communication bead reflected Lan Ling. Outside the Heaven Secrets Curtain, the person who had arrived was also Lan Ling.</p><p>“Sister Lan Ling…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen recognized this red-clothed sister from her days in White Cave.</p><p>Back then, Lan Ling was a captain leading a team of red-clothed people guarding White Cave, with members like Xin, Heiming, Night Guardian, and others.</p><p>Now, under Sword Deity Rao’s arrangement, Lan Ling should have been stationed at the Holy Divine Palace in Dongtianwang City. Why did she come here?</p><p>“Sister Zhiwen.”</p><p>As the Heaven Secrets Curtain withdrew, Lan Ling, with a hint of urgency, spoke without any pleasantries, getting straight to the point:</p><p>“The City Lord Mansion of Tiansang City sent a message, and the extradimensional space rift in White Cave has reopened.”</p><p>“This time, it is highly likely that Infernal Hell Sea will resurface.”</p><p>“But Sword Deity Rao has mobilized most of the red-clothed and white-clothed personnel. Now White Cave is short-handed, and I must rush back to guard it.’</p><p>Infernal Hell Sea?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s starry eyes were filled with surprise.</p><p>It happened at the precise moment when one of the Seven Breaks was about to</p><p>reappear?</p><p>If it had been a little later, she could have gone to help…</p><p>“Alright, Sister Lan Ling.” After pondering for a brief moment, Yu Zhiwen nodded.</p><p>She understood what Lan Ling was worried about and took the initiative to say, “I’ll keep an eye on the Imperial City. When this trial here is over, I’ll go take over, so you don’t have to worry.”</p><p>“I also need to take my people with me,” Lan Ling said.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s red lips parted, as if wanting to say something but hesitated. Her voice weakened a bit, “Y-yes, as long as they are still there…”</p><p>Lan Ling frowned.</p><p>As long as they were still here?</p><p>What did that mean?</p><p>“Give me their names, and I’ll find them for you,” Yu Zhiwen said, glancing at the spirit mirror, avoiding eye contact with Lan Ling, “…as many as I can.”</p><p>Lan Ling gave it little thought before listing several names, ending with the last three trusted old teammates: “…Xin, Heiming, and Night Guardian.”</p><p>“The others can stay here, but these three must come with me. We’re old partners, and White Cave needs them.”</p><p>In silence, Yu Zhiwen cast her seals.</p><p>With a flick of her jade-like fingers, Divine Light Patterns emerged and penetrated the various spirit mirror images before her.</p><p>Lan Ling waited with anticipation in her eyes.</p><p>Finally, she no longer had to guard Dongtianwang City; she could return to her battlefield. This ignited a fire within her.</p><p>Red -clothed people belonged on the battlefield and could not sit in one place for too long.</p><p>And White Cave was a place she had guarded for many years—a site of their youth with numerous beautiful and unpleasant memories.</p><p>It was their everything, their mission as red-clothed people.</p><p>But…</p><p>A dead silence!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen cast her seals repeatedly, and the spirit mirror images showed no response.</p><p>She pursed her lips and cast the spell once more.</p><p>This time, even a layman like Lan Ling could see that it was Yu Zhiwen’s third seal after repeated casts, and there was still no ripple in the spirit mirror images.</p><p>Under the Heaven Secrets Curtain, the atmosphere became tense in front of the main spirit mirror.</p><p>Lan Ling, with a sense of foreboding, asked, “Sister Zhiwen, is something wrong?”</p><p>For the fourth time, Yu Zhiwen infused the Divine Secret into the spirit mirror images, yet there was still no response.</p><p>She took a deep breath, and turned around, but still did not dare to look at Lan Ling. She lowered her head and said, “They… seem to have fallen. Probably.”</p><p>“Fallen?” Lan Ling exclaimed.</p><p>“Yes, fallen…</p><p>“Uh, can you try again?” Lan Ling shook her head, chuckled softly, and gestured with her fingers in front of her: “They are not ordinary red-clothed people!”</p><p>“Xin, a bald man, very strong…”</p><p>“Heiming, always wearing an armor, easily recognizable…”</p><p>“And Night Guardian, he looks like a half-century-old man, but the murderous intent on him is very distinctive. It’s the kind that others can spot at a glance…”</p><p>After her detailed description, Lan Ling’s eyelids drooped, and with a prolonged silence, she asked, “Really can’t find them?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
