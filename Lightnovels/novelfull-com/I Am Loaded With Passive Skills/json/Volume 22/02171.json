Now, he has formed his dragon force and is someone to reckon with.”</p><p>“What you need to do is to befriend him. This way, Bazhun’an won’t come and trouble us.’</p><p>MO MO did not say anything.</p><p>She didn’t care if she befriended him or not.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou needed help, she would help him, but if he didn’t, she wouldn’t get too close.</p><p>It was good to be alone.</p><p>“You…” Feng Yujin seemed to have seen through the girl’s calm state of mind and felt a little helpless.. “You’re really so transparent!” Feng Yujin had already tried his best to persuade her, so there was nothing more he could say for the moment.</p><p>“He will look for me.” MO MO suddenly said.</p><p>“Why do you say that?”</p><p>“Just an intuition.”</p><p>“Ha…” Feng Yujin almost laughed out loud. “I just hope he’s not here to cause you trouble!”</p><p>“If there is any, it’s because of you.”</p><p>“I am the Emperor here! We are in the same boat!” MO MO didn’t retort and stepped forward.</p><p>She wanted to leave the Yunlun Mountain Range.</p><p>The trial had come to an end. Xu Xiaoshou was not around, and MO MO was not interested in the competition between the Dragon Range Lord and Pixiu Mountain. They were just here as a formality.</p><p>If in the end, Xu Xiaoshou needed her to participate in the Holy Palace Trial and help out, she did not have to get a spot here and go all out to show herself.</p><p>MO MO finally understood after a trip to the Yunlun Mountain Range.</p><p>No matter how formal the way to participate in the trial was, with Feng Yujin around, she would always be a mouse.</p><p>Since that was the case, the next time he wanted to go, he could just go directly. There was no need for her to tag along.</p><p>Feng Yujin was a little noisy, but his ability was indeed strong. With this master key, MO Mo’s indifferent attitude turned even colder.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>At this moment, Feng Yujin’s voice sounded in her mind. The power of the gray fog surged and kept his aura perfectly hidden.</p><p>MO Mo’s expression did not change, but she was deep in thought.</p><p>Another big shot came?</p><p>After she received the inheritance and her strength grew, she no longer feared the Cutting Path and the higher void.</p><p>Every time Feng Yujin did this, he was afraid he would be targeted by a demi-saint, someone with the demi-saint’s combat strength, or a Holy Emperor.</p><p>MO MO did not ask.</p><p>She knew what Feng Yujin would say.</p><p>“Look above. Take note of this person.”</p><p>“The hidden expert of the Holy Divine Palace is Kun Peng. He’s older than me and has lived for countless years. In short, his abilities are extremely terrifying. We shouldn’t provoke him.”</p><p>Kun Peng?</p><p>This was the first time MO MO had heard of such a mutated beast. She raised her head slightly.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Feng Yujin was already aware of this blast before the airwave surged through the Yunlun Mountain Range.</p><p>At the same time, the trial-takers in the mountains looked up in shock and saw an unforgettable magnificent sight.</p><p>The sky seemed to have turned into a heavenly pool, and a big fish leapt out. It was huge, likely thousands of miles or so in length, but it stirred up the water and shook the clouds. It then spread its wings as it turned into a bird and flew up to the Nine Heavens.</p><p>“Fish! What a big fish!”</p><p>“Wow, it turned into a bird. What kind of creature was that… What a big fish and bird!”</p><p>“What fish or bird? Show some respect. That was Kun Peng! That was the Kun Peng phenomenon that could occasionally be seen in the Central Region. It should be Elder Yu from the Saint Mountain, right?”</p><p>“Who is Elder Yu?”</p><p>“I don’t know…”</p><p>Very few people knew the true origin of this existence. After all, Kun Peng had disappeared from the world for countless years.</p><p>In front of the Heaven Secrets Curtain and the master of the spirit mirror.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen raised her eyes that had lost some of their usual starry luster.</p><p>After she felt that kind of power, the strength that she had re-established collapsed. She could not help but feel sad. Her nose twitched and she sobbed.</p><p>“Grandpa Yu…”</p><p>“Hey! ”</p><p>Kun Peng who had blotted out the sky disappeared in an instant. He turned into a skinny old man dressed in casual clothes and held a fishing rod that was more than ten feet long. He hurriedly ran over in a pair of muddy straw shoes. “Ah, my little sweetheart, why are you so sad? Who made you angry?”</p><p>“Oh, don’t cry, don’t cry. Grandpa is here. Tell Grandpa why you are so sad.</p><p>Don’t cry. Good girl.”</p><p>He tossed his fishing rod aside when he saw his precious great-granddaughter. Kun Peng, God of the Council of Ten of the Holy Divine Palace, Elder Yu, immediately threw the mission to the back of his mind.</p><p>He patted her on the back and comforted Xiaoyu, who cried bitterly. At the same time, he thought about how he would execute the Heavenly Slaughter on the bastard who made his little darling cry.</p><p>“What happened exactly?” Elder Yu asked.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen lifted her head from Grandpa Yu’s shoulder and wiped her eyes. “Nothing… why are you here, Grandpa Yu?”</p><p>“Let’s talk about you first.” Elder Yu put his hands on his hips and puffed his cheeks. His two gills twitched aggressively as he said, “Let Grandpa help you take revenge first!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was amused by the old man’s weird expression, but her laughter stopped after she recalled the matter that made her sad and her low spirits returned.</p><p>“It’s nothing. Let’s talk about you.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Hmm, Grandpa Yu is here for Abyss Island?”</p><p>“Right, the Holy Emperor’s aura had passed through, and Hallmaster Dao sent a message back. It just so happened that Grandpa Yu was free, so I had to go over and take a look.”</p><p>Sent a message?</p><p>Was it about the battle situation on Abyss Island?</p><p>“Then you should go quickly. You have important matters to attend to.” Yu Zhiwen quickly let go of Elder Yu’s hand.</p><p>Time was indeed tight. Elder Yu had no time to chat. He said, “Then Grandpa Yu will come back the next time. We’ll go to the Dragon Cave and catch those stupid dragons.”</p><p>“Yes.” Yu Zhiwen nodded vigorously.</p><p>Elder Yu picked up his fishing rod and transformed into Kun Peng. He spread his wings and flew toward Abyss Island.</p><p>Everyone in the Yunlun Mountain Range looked up and were once again shocked.</p><p>However, not long after, a boom reverberated across the land.</p><p>Kun Peng who blotted out the sky smashed into the Black Tortoise Gate of Sky City. This caused it to feel dizzy and its huge body swayed. It couldn’t enter.</p><p>“Huh?” Elder Yu was stunned. He transformed into his human form, took out his void token, and rammed against it again.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Once again, he bounced back.</p><p>“What happened?” Yu Zhiwen had followed him and landed on the Lone Cliff.</p><p>“Abyss Island, we can’t enter!” Elder Yu’s eyes darted around as if he had thought of something. He gasped, “Hiss, doesn’t that mean Rao Wangze had to face the four…</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was shocked. She remembered Lan Ling’s request and asked anxiously, “The situation on Abyss Island isn’t serious, right? What did Hallmaster Dao say?”</p><p>It was not serious… Elder Yu muttered to himself as his lips twitched. After a slight tug, it turned into a warm smile.</p><p>He waved his hand and said in disdain.</p><p>“It’s a small matter. There’s nothing to worry about.”</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao said that there’s someone called Xu Xiaoshou who mobilized the power of the Holy Emperor and wanted to defy the Heavens. However, Rao Wangze could suppress him with a flip of his hand; it’s as easily as crushing an ant.”</p><p>“Ah?” Yu Zhiwen’s starry eyes were stunned and she looked worried. “Xu Xiaoshou? Which Xu Xiaoshou was that?”</p><p>“Why? You know him?” Elder Yu was stunned..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
