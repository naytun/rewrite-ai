(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Crazy!</p><p>How arrogant!</p><p>He was too arrogant!</p><p>Even though they watched the battle of the Desolate Inferno Domain from the side through the spirit mirror, everyone was still shocked by the black figure who stood on the top of the lone building and the power he wielded.</p><p>Under the sky, under the full moon, the black lonely figure stood out on top of the tall building.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had displayed this kind of imagery before. It was so magnificent that even Rao Yaoyao had been controlled by him.</p><p>And now, after Xu Xiaoshou received the power of the Holy Emperor, he punched Rao Yaoyao and kicked Dao Qiongcang. He wanted to fight a Holy Emperor again! How could this not be considered crazy?</p><p>“Was that really Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“There’s something wrong with this fellow. He’s clearly been driven to a cultivation deviation by the power of a Holy Emperor…”</p><p>“Yes, but Holy Emperor Xu was able to control it. Cultivation deviation is only one of the sword techniques he can control. Amazing!”</p><p>“It’s too scary. Xu Xiaoshou’s type of talent only appears once in a thousand years. In my opinion, even Bazhun’an can’t compare to it.”</p><p>“Wangze Holy Emperor is only a thought incarnation of a Holy Emperor, but Xu Xiaoshou had received four portions of the Holy Emperor’s power. It’s four against one! ”</p><p>. It is definitely a good plan. I admire the Eighth Sword Deity’s move, but Wangze Holy Emperor might not lose… How do you know if Xu Xiaoshou would be able to withstand the impact of those four forces? How long he can last is still a question!”</p><p>This unique skill was indeed thought-provoking.</p><p>The Holy Emperor’s power wasn’t that easy to endure, let alone four incompatible powers.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had received the power of the Holy Emperor that was passed down to him. It was understandable that he could use it to fight a demi-saint.</p><p>Now…</p><p>Either he had the confidence to be arrogant.</p><p>Otherwise, he would explode like fireworks soon after he made some nonsensical statements.</p><p>Would his glory be fleeting?</p><p>How long could Xu Xiaoshou last?</p><p>Ten Auras?</p><p>Thirty Auras?</p><p>Or 100 Auras?</p><p>Everyone tried to estimate the time.</p><p>On the Desolate Inferno Domain, Xu Xiaoshou also faced the most serious problem of time.</p><p>“Four Divine Pillars…”</p><p>He could tell that this was a Saint Stage Divine Array and a sacrificial array.</p><p>Even Elder Han and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man were being reused. Xu Xiaoshou didn’t expect this even though he had racked his brains. This was too unexpected!</p><p>Even Lei Xi’er wasn’t within the range of the previous array eye that he had considered.</p><p>When he looked at this wave, Bazhu’nan, the Black Hand behind all this, should also have the reputation of being ‘unpredictable’, right?</p><p>There was no doubt that the Saint Stage divine array, the Four Divine Pillars, was extremely powerful.</p><p>However, even Lei Xi’er, who was the weakest of the quarter, wouldn’t be sucked dry due to the existence of the God Devil Eyes and the Ultimate Life Demon Physique.</p><p>The ones that were sacrificed were too powerful, whether they were the host or the person being sacrificed.</p><p>After they combined into one, their power was almost endless, so they would not be drained dry.</p><p>On the other hand, Xu Xiaoshou, the main vessel, was in great pain!</p><p>The four chaotic forces were even more torturous than the two extremes of ice and fire and the opposition of black and white. They wreaked havoc in his body.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou made an estimation…</p><p>He could not estimate the time at all!</p><p>The only thing he could think of was that he was invincible at this moment. As for how long he could maintain this ‘moment’, he did not have the answer.</p><p>There was still one Emperor and two Saints on the other side.</p><p>Therefore, the only thing on his mind was:</p><p>“Let’s end this quickly!”</p><p>The power of the Four Divine Pillars came from all directions in the sky, like four chains that bound Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stood on the top of the lone building as he maintained his cultivation deviation state.</p><p>There was a boundless sea of fire under his feet and seven blood trees behind him. The phantom of the green Divine Prison expanded continuously around his body as it suppressed the world. Dragon scales appeared on his body, dragon horns popped out on his head, and the aura of the dragon on his body gradually flourished.</p><p>These four forces were indeed violent, chaotic, and destructive, but this was because they were too powerful compared to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>In fact, these four forces were obedient, gentle, and could be used at will.</p><p>With a thought, Xu Xiaoshou looked at Wangze Holy Emperor and the four impulses in his body were about to overflow in their attempt to help him kill the Emperor.</p><p>He even knew how to control this power without being taught.</p><p>“It’s time to end this…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered as his eyes turned extremely cold.</p><p>Under everyone’s gaze, he raised his hand and casually pointed. It was the same when Wangze Holy Emperor first descended from the Stairway to Heaven.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>The sea of fire howled.</p><p>The high temperature melted the space and revealed the Order of the Great</p><p>Path.</p><p>The white flame Holy Emperor followed this set of Path Principles and resembled ten thousand snakes as he rushed towards Wangze Holy Emperor.</p><p>“Infernal Heavens!”</p><p>He did not need any other power to support him.</p><p>With just a glance and a finger, the battle situation was instantly reversed and white flames filled the sky.</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor’s attack missed and was blocked by the combination of Water Ghost and the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon. The situation took a turn for the worse.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou completed his transformation in an instant.</p><p>With a single finger and a single glance, he was set ablaze!</p><p>Body, spirit, path energy… Even the projection of the Wind Rites Sutra on his hand were ignited by the white flames.</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor was unmoved. He only exhaled lightly.</p><p>“Gentle Wind’s Guidance.”</p><p>With a whoosh, a gentle wind blew across the sea of fire.</p><p>In an instant, the ten thousand miles of white flames gathered together into a huge fireball.</p><p>Under the suction force of the core, even the white flames on Wangze Holy Emperor’s body were torn away.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you are bathed in glory now, but how long can you last?”</p><p>“Once the wind and clouds disperse, would you know the extent of your misery?”</p><p>A faint smile appeared on Wangze Holy Emperor’s calm face..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
