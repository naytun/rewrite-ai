(1)</h1><p>Chapter 2119: Sacred Secret Abyss Island, Sacred Emperor Xu Xiaoshou! (1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Water Ghost was at his wit’s end?</p><p>When he heard his exasperated voice, Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he had heard the biggest joke in the world. He was filled with disbelief.</p><p>Water Ghost, who oversaw the entire planning and arrangement of Abyss Island, was at his wits’ end?</p><p>Or rather, he was Water Ghost’s last resort!</p><p>“I am his trump card?”</p><p>“If I was your last trump card, you should have informed me in advance. At least tell me what my abilities are, right?” Xu Xiaoshou almost cursed aloud.</p><p>He was shocked when he realized Water Ghost and Bazhun’an had not communicated with each other. Rather, both sides felt that the other party had secretly given him some information.</p><p>In the end, coincidentally, no one said anything, right?</p><p>“You don’t have to scam me in this manner, right?”</p><p>As he rode on the dragon’s head, Xu Xiaoshou searched his mind, but he could not figure out how he could be Water Ghost’s trump card.</p><p>He watched as the Heavenly Ancestor Light descended from the sky and was about to hit Water Ghost, who was trapped in Dao Qiongcang’s body.</p><p>With the pure power of the ancestral source, Water Ghost, who had yet to reach the Saint Stage, would definitely die!</p><p>“I’m convinced!”</p><p>At the critical moment, Xu Xiaoshou cursed angrily. He could not just stand by and watch.</p><p>He made a grabbing motion and the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff appeared in his palm.</p><p>“Freeze!”</p><p>With a buzz, the spiritual source in the energy reserve was instantly emptied. Xu Xiaoshou’s face suddenly turned pale.</p><p>However, the entire Abyss Island came to a standstill!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s broken and bloody body…</p><p>Water Ghost’s angry voice drifted away…</p><p>The Heavenly Ancestor Light that fell from the sky, the power of the ancestral source that even a demi-saint could not contain…</p><p>Everything was paused!</p><p>On the ruins of the First Hall of Sins, the expressions of the hundreds and thousands of Spiritual Cultivators were frozen in shock.</p><p>In the sky above the Desolate Inferno Domain, Dao Qiongcang turned around in surprise. There was even a flicker of shock in his eyes. Even Xu Xiaoshou himself was slightly stunned.</p><p>“Everything really froze?”</p><p>Not a single person, object, or animal on the entire Abyss Island could move at this moment, except for Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was in control of the entire scene. His first reaction was to be confused.</p><p>His second reaction was that Kong Yuhen definitely wasn’t just an ordinary member of the Ten High Nobles!</p><p>Perhaps Bazhun’an was right. That guy was not from this era.</p><p>The Time Ancestor Shadow Staff could even control the power of the ancestral source. This meant that the power within had already reached the level of the Holy Emperor!</p><p>And it was impossible for the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff, one of the top ten Great Psionic Weapons, to do so.</p><p>It was only on the same level as the Blood World Pearl and the Sea God’s Trident. How could it control the Heavenly Ancestor punishment triggered by the Si Wu Formation?</p><p>“So, Kong Yuhen had the power of a Holy Emperor?”</p><p>“And this is the trump card that Water Ghost placed on me?”</p><p>Enlightenment flashed in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes, but he quickly denied it. Not to mention Water Ghost, even Bazhun’an couldn’t figure out Kong Yuhen’s status.</p><p>In the entire world, there were probably very few people who could remember an existence like the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff, other than at specific moments.</p><p>When Dao Qiongcang plotted against everything in the world, he must have subconsciously forgotten about the existence of Kong Yuhen, let alone Water Ghost who had yet to reach the Saint realm.</p><p>“Since the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff was not the trump card that Water Ghost thought could save his life, then what was it?”</p><p>Taking advantage of this short pause, Xu Xiaoshou’s body was motionless, but his brain spun rapidly.</p><p>He immediately put himself in Water Ghost’s shoes and thought about what he would have done if he had set up such a big chess game on Abyss Island and wanted to kill Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>“If I was Water Ghost, I would have undergone sanctification long ago. Why would I wait for Dao Qiongcang to appear and then undergo sanctification in front of him?”</p><p>“Isn’t this giving the initiative to the enemy?”</p><p>“But Water Ghost still did it. Other than the fact that he’s an idiot, there’s only</p><p>one other reason. He did it on purpose!”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>After Yan Wuse and Dao Qiongcang appeared on the stage, numerous scenes flew into his mind. Xu Xiaoshou quickly grasped the most glaring point:</p><p>On the surface, Water Ghost and Dao Qiongcang appeared to scheme against each other and had a a great time as they tussled in a battle of wits.</p><p>In fact, these two ‘underhanded’ people knew how much deceit each one of them hid. They were also well aware of each other’s thoughts.</p><p>However, under such circumstances, Water Ghost still delayed his sanctification and waited for Dao Qiongcang to arrive.</p><p>Under Dao Qiongcang’s watchful eye, he tried to undergo sanctification many times, from the First Hall of Sins, the Blood World, the Azure Marsh… and the current Desolate Inferno Domain.</p><p>He knew that he would be suppressed and couldn’t become a Saint, but he still acted like he was not aware of anything.</p><p>In the end, he flashed to the Desolate Inferno Domain and chose to undergo a proper sanctification. He wanted to deal a fatal blow to Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>Now, he was at the end of his tether and had to make a move.</p><p>“Desolate Inferno Domain!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt that the answer was too obvious.</p><p>Why the Desolate Inferno Domain?</p><p>Water Ghost was a Water-type Upanishad. He could choose any place to undergo sanctification, but he definitely wouldn’t choose the Desolate Inferno Domain.</p><p>The temperature here, the volcanoes…</p><p>From Water Ghost’s perspective, it was even uncomfortable to look at it, right? But he still chose this place!</p><p>“What was the mystery about the Desolate Inferno Domain?”</p><p>“And why was I Water Ghost’s trump card?”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou felt that his thoughts were unimpeded and everything was connected.</p><p>The situation on Abyss Island had to be traced back to the White Cave, because this was not Water Ghost’s scheme, but Bazhun’an’s scheme!</p><p>“The Desolate Inferno Domain is the most suitable place for the Infernal lineage. Even the lava of the volcano is filled with the Infernal aura. This place had clearly been chosen for me…”</p><p>“White Cave, the appearance of Flame Python, the wretched saint, and the intent behind the white bead that he gave me. Other than the map of the White Cave, I have yet to understand the meaning behind it….”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
