(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>The hunchbacked old man waited for a while. When Palace Master Bai Zhou was able to react and speak normally, he spoke loudly and respectfully.</p><p>“Only Wu Xia, Chang Heng, and three hundred Elders have arrived. The rest are not here.”</p><p>“Where are they? Did they not come?” The beautiful woman glanced over, her eyes shimmery but without any emotion in them.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>With this, the great hall quietened down considerably. Even the few people who waited below were worried.</p><p>Suddenly, with a loud bang, Palace Master Bai Zhou smashed the jade pot in his hand. He stood up angrily and overturned the jade table.</p><p>The purple table that was sent spinning in the air had yet to land when Palace Master Bai Zhou flew out in a flash and kicked it with his bare feet.</p><p>“Peng! ”</p><p>Jade fragments flew in all directions, and the entire hall was filled with killing intent.</p><p>Palace Master Bai Zhou’s body swayed for a moment before he steadied himself and turned his head. He snorted coldly and said.</p><p>“If they can’t come, then there’s no need for them to come at all!”</p><p>“Old turtle! Name the people who didn’t come… Burp, give me their location one by one. I’ll go and kill them now!”</p><p>“Sons of b*tches! How dare you all look down on me?” he said loudly.</p><p>The hunchbacked old man, who was called Old Turtle, lowered his head even more and did not dare to raise it at all.</p><p>“Palace Master Bai Zhou, you are really handsome, majestic, and extraordinary!”</p><p>“The entire Southern Region sang praises of your great achievements. They all regard you as the true savior.”</p><p>“Do you know who these great people are, Palace Master Bai Zhou?”</p><p>“What? You don’t remember? We were just talking about the matter of Rao</p><p>Yaoyao’s Saint Fall. You can continue.”</p><p>Palace Master Bai Zhou staggered and fell onto the purple beast bone throne. His cheeks turned red, and he laughed.</p><p>“Hehe, was that really the case?”</p><p>“Old Turtle, go and write another book. Let the people of the Half-Moon Residence spread the battle results for me. Just like the battle in the Dragon</p><p>Cave last time… Burp!”</p><p>“The last time I went out, I didn’t hear anyone talk about my glory in the Dragon Cave. D*mn it. They took the credit but did not do anything. They deserve to be killed!”</p><p>Old Turtle nodded and said. “Yeah. Rao Yaoyao really deserved to die.”</p><p>Palace Master Bai Zhou’s eyes lit up as if his soul had returned. He brought his legs together and covered the high-slitted skirt. He sat upright and solemnly said.</p><p>“Right, let’s get down to business. Let’s not bother about the people from the war faction for now. Have you investigated who was responsible for Rao Yaoyao’s Saint Fall?” Suddenly, he could even speak coherently.</p><p>Old Turtle heaved a sigh of relief. The real Palace Master Bai Zhou was asleep, and the fake Palace Master was back. This was great.</p><p>“I heard it was Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>“The Saint Servant Lord Shou who had been in the limelight recently?” Palace Master Bai Zhou asked.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Hmph, I wonder if Bazhun’an’s people are traitors. I’ll personally meet him in the future when I have time. Caramel said that he would consider it, but whether he can be poached over is still another matter…” Palace Master Bai Zhou frowned. He waved his hand and said, “Let’s put this matter aside for now. How’s Feng Xiaose?”</p><p>“No news.”</p><p>“He’s on Abyss Island… Xu Xiaoshou was actually able to kill Rao Yaoyao. He must have obtained a great opportunity! From the looks of it, he should have met Feng Xiaose before. There were only a few top figures on the island… When</p><p>Feng Xiaose comes back, we can ask him what he was like.”</p><p>“As long as he can come back.” Old Turtle even dared to tease him.</p><p>“Bullshit!” Palace Master Bai Zhou’s beautiful eyes narrowed as he glared at this turtle bastard. However, he was not angry. Instead, he looked at a person below.</p><p>“Wu Xia… Ah, my condolences. Anyways, Rao Yaoyao is dead. This matter is certainly very satisfying, but you won’t be able to take revenge personally.”</p><p>“But I promise you!”</p><p>Palace Master Bai Zhou patted his chest, which seemed as if it was about to erupt. He did not care about the effects. His movements were rough, like a burly man. He said in a powerful voice, “If there’s a mission in the future, I’ll definitely bring you along. You can kill as many red-clothed people as you wish. It’s so satisfying to kill them!”</p><p>“Alright.” Wu Xia was in a bad mood and was silent.</p><p>Palace Master Bai Zhou did not say anything more. He looked around at the people below, and his eyes flashed with danger.</p><p>“This group of people should really be properly dealt with. After all, I am the Palace Master on the surface…</p><p>“Feng Xiaose isn’t here, and he didn’t even send a young man to represent himself at the meeting. Heh!”</p><p>Palace Master Bai Zhou’s beautiful eyes were filled with killing intent. Suddenly, he thrust out his chest and burped again. His solemn expression was no longer there.</p><p>“Hehe, Old Turtle, do you think that Xu Xiaoshou is handsome or not?” “Oh right, let the Half-Moon Residence spread the rumors about me again!”</p><p>“They’re promoting Bazhun’an… Burp, they’re working so hard to promote me. It’s as if you’re sucking milk. Squeeze a little, and only a little bit will come out. If you don’t squeeze, you won’t get any. What a son of a b*tch!” “There’s more, there’s more… Why are you retreating?”</p><p>“Ah?” Old Turtle was terrified, but he had no choice but to stay.</p><p>As expected, Palace Master Bai Zhou thrust out his chest and raised his head again as if something was coming up from his abdomen.</p><p>“Ugh!”</p><p>She vomited all over him!</p><p>Western Region.</p><p>Deep mountains, old forests, ancient temples.</p><p>A little monk, who was no more than eleven or twelve years old, grabbed a long wooden stick and ran into the temple.</p><p>He looked around and found no one. He bowed to the Buddha statue, turned around, and ran out again. With the support of his long staff, he flew to the top of the temple.</p><p>“Abbot! Abbot! They said that Rao Yaoyao had a Saint Fall. Who is Rao Yaoyao?</p><p>Is she a devotee?”</p><p>The little monk looked worriedly at Abbot Youxi, whose belly was so big it was as if he had swallowed the stone lion in front of the temple. He was always afraid that if he took a few more steps, he would step on the roof tiles and fall to his death..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
