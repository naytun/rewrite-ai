(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Unable to resist, he could only endure this morbid pain.</p><p>The Dragon Melting Realm controlled Dao Qiongcang and Rao Yaoyao. With a flash, Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to delay and dashed from the First Hall of Sins to the Azure Marsh.</p><p>“Cutie Rao, here I come!”</p><p>When the original owner of the Dragon Melting Realm flashed into the Azure</p><p>Marsh, the water in the swamp instantly evaporated, and the ground cracked.</p><p>When Rao Yaoyao heard this, her ears spewed fire and her beautiful eyes were filled with shock. “You mad dog…”</p><p>Her voice trembled.</p><p>However, before the voice could settle, Xu Xiaoshou was there and he swung his Sleeveless, Red Scorched hands forward like an offering.</p><p>The line of fire from the Dragon Melting Realm pierced through him and took control of his body. However, he didn’t want to move anymore. Rao Yaoyao had to make a move at this moment.</p><p>If this attack hit her, even if she entered a semi-illusory state with the Swordless Sword Technique, her head would probably explode.</p><p>“Xuan Gang!”</p><p>With a delicate cry, a golden fate dragon surged out of the Cang Godhood Sword. It wrapped around Rao Yaoyao’s body and purified the white flames on her body.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao quickly retreated as she followed Dao Qiongcang’s instructions.</p><p>At this moment, even if one didn’t want to follow, everyone knew that one could not confront Xu Xiaoshou in his current state.</p><p>Even if she was Rao Yaoyao!</p><p>The ancient sword saint had unparalleled combat strength!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s attack missed, and a huge black hole appeared in front of him.</p><p>However, he was not afraid of the spatial storm at all. White flames exploded like a cauldron explosion and scattered in all directions.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou spread out his hands and flicked his wrists. Like a spider’s thread, the white flames condensed and exploded instantly as it shot toward Rao</p><p>Yaoyao.</p><p>Today, he would go after a demi-saint!</p><p>No one could escape!</p><p>“Chi chi sizzle…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao who was still on guard against Xu Xiaoshou’s Demons Under Eyes, never expected Xu Xiaoshou to suddenly use a new move.</p><p>It was still effective!</p><p>The compressed white flame threads passed through the body of the Golden Fate Dragon that protected and hit her acupuncture points.</p><p>“This?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s energy reserve was blocked, and her expression changed drastically.</p><p>The Holy Power in her body originally circulated smoothly in her meridians, but now it was as if there was a blockage that made it difficult to pass through.</p><p>“Coincidence?”</p><p>“He just happened to hit my acupuncture points?”</p><p>With this momentary delay, the white flame thread tugged hard. At the same time Rao Yaoyao was pulled back and Xu Xiaoshou followed suit.</p><p>The Weaving Expertise was different from the Divine Secret. It was a Weaving Technique that formed and outlined the picture.</p><p>After this Expertise Passive Skill was extracted and upgraded, Xu Xiaoshou had mastered abilities such as the Puppet Manipulation Thread.</p><p>However, at that time, the level of the passive skill was too low. Xu Xiaoshou could not see through the diagram of the human body’s meridians.</p><p>Therefore, the idea of controlling the enemy’s body through the spiritual source threads could only be hidden and remained dormant.</p><p>Now, the Holy Emperor’s Lv.o Weaving Expertise was enough to turn it from a support passive skill into a fatal move!</p><p>How could it be a coincidence?</p><p>What Xu Xiaoshou was looking for was the point on Rao Yaoyao’s body that the Holy Power had to pass through.</p><p>His target were those acupuncture points!</p><p>The Demons Under Eyes had appeared many times, so she would definitely be on her guard.</p><p>Other than Soul Reading, if he wanted to make sure that Rao Yaoyao could not understand, he had to come up with a new trick!</p><p>“Cutie Rao die!”</p><p>As he tugged on the silk threads, he watched Rao Yaoyao’s body being cut open by the fire snakes under the Dragon Melting Realm. Xu Xiaoshou ruthlessly destroyed the flower.</p><p>The Sleeveless Red Scorched Hand emerged mercilessly and stabbed straight into Rao Yaoyao’s heart!</p><p>“You dare?!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s pretty face turned pale. When she broke through the shackles and regained her senses, Xu Xiaoshou was already in front of her. She subconsciously tightened her grip on her sword and stared at him.</p><p>“The World of Mortals!”</p><p>“Demons Under Eyes!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed maniacally as he had perfectly predicted Rao Yaoyao’s subconscious reaction.</p><p>The two of them were hit and both of them froze at the same time.</p><p>However, the inertia did not stop there. Xu Xiaoshou stabbed his right hand into Rao Yaoyao’s heart. The power of the Holy Emperor poured into her body and immediately exploded inside her.</p><p>“Boom!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
