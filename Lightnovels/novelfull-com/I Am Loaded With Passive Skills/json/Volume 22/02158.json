(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Leaving one’s back to the enemy was not the behavior of a gentleman.</p><p>He would leave Wangze Holy Emperor’s battle to him. Dao Qiongcang thought to himself.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor murmured at the peak of the Desolate Inferno Domain as if he wanted to commit this name to his memory.</p><p>He didn’t dwell too much on the Si Wu Formation’s operation or the Transformation of the Holy Emperor’s Aura within Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>This figure slowly raised his hand.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The storm gathered, and the sky seemed to point downward again.</p><p>Unlike the siege on the Stairway to Heaven, Wangze Holy Emperor entered the arena with his main body to defeat the enemy.</p><p>The power of the Azure Finger was even stronger than the previous attack.</p><p>However Xu Xiaoshou flew into the air. He still had two guardians in front of him.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, go forth and thrive! Leave the rest to me…”</p><p>Mei Siren glanced at the sky and then looked away.</p><p>He flicked his sleeves and a murderous intent rose up. The Taicheng Sword hung upside down in front of his chest. He no longer looked like a kind teacher and displayed only the sharpness of an unsheathed sword.</p><p>The old Sword Saint was fearless as he faced the Azure Finger. He chanted and his sword fingers brushed against the sword body.</p><p>At this time, inch by inch, the Taicheng Sword was brushed through like dust being wiped away.</p><p>Red plum blossoms fluttered down and the Sword Will descended.</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>Abyss Island trembled at the sound of the sword cries.</p><p>The red plum blossoms that filled the sky touched the Azure Finger, and the latter paused slightly.</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor’s body became more solid and he looked a little surprised. He waited quietly for the sword and didn’t attack.</p><p>Soon, Mei Siren’s ethereal Saint Language grew increasingly louder until it echoed in all directions.</p><p>“The setting sun dwells in the mountain, the sword shines through disaster.”</p><p>“In the past, the prehistoric days were born.”</p><p>“Shadows leap in the forest, ripples erupt on the lake.”</p><p>“Taicheng traveled to the sky, the red plum blossoms lamented.”</p><p>With each sentence, the Sword Will on Mei Siren’s body grew stronger.</p><p>After he recited these four sentences, the old sword saint regained his youth. His face was ruddy, and his aura turned mellow. His form became as light as a feather.</p><p>It was as if the Taicheng Sword had drunk wine that was hot and strong. The sharp Sword Will cut through the space path and tore apart the pressure of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>The sword flew into the sky in a fit of anger!</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>In the ruins of the First Hall of Sins, the spirit mirror that the onlookers used was torn apart by the Sword Will.</p><p>However, the colors of the sword in the distance was within sight, so there was no need to find another way to watch the battle.</p><p>“What’s this?!”</p><p>“What sword technique did Master Siren use? Why haven’t I seen it before?”</p><p>“That’s not right. When he defeated the Divine Oracle previously, it was clearly that tactic. It’s not like this now… How did he suddenly become stronger? This is an ancient swordsman?”</p><p>“Are you stupid? Previously, there were rules that restricted the old sword saint from taking action. Now that he has obtained those Mystery Boxes, there’s no need for him to keep it hidden?”</p><p>“The pressure the Holy Emperor exuded on Master Siren is still too great…Look! Man and Sword as One! This sword, I’m afraid it’s…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked shocked and confused as he glanced at Rao Yaoyao as if he wanted to confirm something.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao who hovered in the air, looked up.</p><p>She saw the Taicheng Sword at this moment, and how its will completely coincided with Mei Siren’s and she understood the old sword saint’s intention.</p><p>As she gripped the Cang Godhood Sword tightly, a trace of envy flashed in Rao Yaoyao’s eyes.</p><p>This was the realm that she also pursued!</p><p>After the Saint Language, a calm voice followed, but it was sonorous and powerful. “Taicheng, Heavenly Unravel!”</p><p>Chi Chi Sizzle…</p><p>After the Taicheng flew into the sky, Mei Siren carried the ferocious sword image and flew up.</p><p>The illusory Power Upanishad Formation exploded from the Taicheng Sword’s blow at Mei Siren’s feet.</p><p>The storm of endless sword energy shattered into pieces and sent Water Ghost flying.</p><p>“What are you doing?!”</p><p>Water Ghost was stunned by the explosion. His body cracked and blood flowed out.</p><p>He was really confused.</p><p>We agreed that we would both be the guardians, but you suddenly showed off and did not warn your teammates…</p><p>The famed sword Heavenly Unravel is beside me. Do you want me to suffer a quick death?</p><p>Water Ghost didn’t want to fight anymore. He flashed away and left the battlefield to Mei Siren.</p><p>As the name suggested, the famed sword Heavenly Unravel was a sword that was fused with the ancient swordsman and his saber. The saber was released by the Way of the Heavens that was hidden by the power of self-concealment.</p><p>On the Shengshen Continent, the treasures were obscured by Heaven, Earth and self.</p><p>This was especially true for the famous treasures. After being nourished by the Nurturing of Fame of Heaven and Earth, they had already become unbelievably strong and had to be sealed.</p><p>However, the path of the ancient swordsman was very strange. Some people had specially studied this. It was not the sword technique, but the power of the sword itself.</p><p>The Heavenly Unravel was designed to activate the characteristics of the famed sword.</p><p>The famed sword here did not refer only to the 21 Famed Swords.</p><p>There were also the Five Great Divine Instruments of Chaos, nine supreme divine weapons, ten Great Psionic Weapons, and even swords that had been on the various rankings but had been lost in the eyes of the world and was listed as one of the Divine Instruments on the Inscription Stele.</p><p>The sword was the foundation and the human was the personality.</p><p>The famed sword Heavenly Unravel pushed away the darkness and let the famed sword and the Holy Emperor undergo sanctification.</p><p>As for how strong the Heavenly Unravel would be depended on how compatible the person was with the sword, as well as how strong the person’s swordsmanship realm was.</p><p>Water Ghost was afraid and fled.</p><p>That was because he had personally seen Bazhun’an’s famed sword Heavenly Unravel. In the battle, he had been beaten to a bloody pulp.</p><p>There were too few ancient swordsman who knew this sword style!</p><p>However, those who could use it and did not die were the outstanding ones among all men!</p><p>It could be said that everyone from the previous era had experienced the power of the ancient swordsman because of the existence of Bazhun’an. Naturally, they had been deeply branded.</p><p>At this moment, his memories intersected with reality.</p><p>Water Ghost looked back after he made his escape and felt that the past and the present overlapped. Although they looked different, the way they used their power were the same..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
