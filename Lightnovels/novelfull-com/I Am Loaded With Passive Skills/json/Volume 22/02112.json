(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Soon, Dao Qiongcang understood Water Ghost’s intentions.</p><p>With a bang, the Great Killing Technique was destroyed by the thunder calamity during its flight.</p><p>However, the powerful heavenly star light still shattered Water Ghost’s protective spiritual barrier and caused his body to bleed.</p><p>Water Ghost didn’t turn himself into any elemental form. Instead, he lost control of his body and fell backwards.</p><p>In the distance, Bai Lian only had the time to ask a question in his confusion.</p><p>In a flash, before he could react, his spine was almost broken by Water Ghost who cannoned into him as he flew backward.</p><p>The two of them dangled like kites on broken strings as they shot into the distance at the same time.</p><p>The saint calamity changed again with a rumble!</p><p>Bai Lian was too close, and even touched the person who transcended the tribulation. The saint calamity deemed that he had interfered or helped!</p><p>“Water Ghost! Dao Qiongcang!” Bai Lian, whose body had been struck by the brute force of the Great Killing Technique, almost collapsed when he sensed that the saint calamity had locked onto him. He let out a furious roar.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang, who was once again submerged by the thunder calamity, blinked.</p><p>Previously, he had not been able to kill Bai Lian in one strike, so he had already given up and decided to settle the score in the future. After all, if he attacked again, it would be beneath his status.</p><p>Bai Lian was also very wise, he did not continue to charge into the game, but retreated.</p><p>However, Dao Qiongcang did not expect Water Ghost to frame him at the cost of his self-harm.</p><p>“Heh.” Water Ghost, who had been sent flying, had a huge bloody hole in his chest. However, he held onto his golden beast mask and sneered.</p><p>“It’s fine if you hit me. Did you do this on purpose?”</p><p>When they followed his gaze, everyone saw the bloodied Bai Lian, who had a terrified expression after the onslaught of the saint calamity.</p><p>He was only a Cutting Path…</p><p>What he should have undergone was the Nine Death Thunder Calamity…</p><p>This situation and development shocked everyone.</p><p>The previous battle under the saint calamity was vague, and Dao Qiongcang and Water Ghost were extremely fast.</p><p>Those who could not keep up with the battle consciousness could not even see</p><p>the moves they had used.</p><p>The only result that could be seen clearly…</p><p>Hallmaster Dao’s final attack sent Water Ghost flying. He even deliberately chose to hit Bai Lian and pulled him into the saint calamity.</p><p>Did he make use of the opportunity to kill?</p><p>On the dragon’s head, Xu Xiaoshou, who was one of the few who could keep up and see the situation clearly, seemed to be in a daze.</p><p>When Dao Qiongcang fought with Water Ghost, one was willing to fight and the other was willing to suffer?</p><p>Then, his cheap junior brother Bai Lian was sucked into the whirlpool?</p><p>Although he did not have any feelings for the Infernal lineage and had never even seen his grandmaster Long Rongzhi, he had swallowed a lot of Holy Blood.</p><p>Furthermore, he had met Mu Ling once before and had a good impression of him.</p><p>Bai Lian was even younger, probably about the same age as Xiao Kongtong, and had a good personality.</p><p>Was he going to die while he was still in his prime?</p><p>Water Ghost and Dao Qiongcang treated the supreme saint calamity as if it was nothing. If Bai Lian was attacked a few more times, he would probably lose his life!</p><p>His defensive spiritual weapon was also limited!</p><p>“This is the Saint War?”</p><p>“This is the Struggle for the Great Path?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could barely stand up.</p><p>Water Ghost and Dao Qiongcang treated human lives like grass and he couldn’t abandon Bai Lian</p><p>But how could he save him?</p><p>Saint calamity…</p><p>It would be a different story if he could cut off the saint calamity with one sword.</p><p>Even if he rushed in now, he would only attract a mutation and he would not be able to save anyone, right?</p><p>“Who dares to touch my disciple!”</p><p>Just as his heart burned with anxiety, a heaven-shaking roar suddenly sounded outside the Desolate Inferno Domain. It was filled with endless anger.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>There was a slight and strange sound that came from afar.</p><p>Black flames shot out of the sky and a white crane emerged from it.</p><p>Browless Mu Ling who was dressed in black, stood on top of the crane. His killing intent surged through his glowering eyes.</p><p>As soon as he stepped onto the field, he saw Bai Lian, who was submerged by the saint calamity and couldn’t even cry for help. After a moment of shock, his heart almost shattered.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang! Do you want to die?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
