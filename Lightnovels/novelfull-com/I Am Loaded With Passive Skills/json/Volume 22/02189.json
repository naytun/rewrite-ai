(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>However, the spiritual sword took the initiative and brought the owner of the Heavenly Unravel away from the battlefield. This could not be repeated. This meant that the Singer of the Stars and Moon had passed away silently and could no longer be restored.</p><p>“Star Moon!”</p><p>The desolate song sent Rao Yaoyao’s remnant soul out of the storm created by the Finger of Annihilation. She broke through the shattered space of Abyss Island and attempted to escape the confinement.</p><p>This was only a grade-one spiritual sword, but it was also a sword that had intelligence. If Rao Yaoyao had paid attention to it, she would definitely be able to enter the famed sword rankings again. She would be able to use her fame to nourish and evolve this sword.</p><p>The Heavenly Unravel was the ultimate song of the world.</p><p>It really matched the reputation of the ancient swordsman as it broke through the space-time debris, left the dispute on Abyss Island, and brought its owner away from the battlefield.</p><p>How could a person not leave a trace in his lifetime?</p><p>“This…”</p><p>On the other side, Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded.</p><p>He had never thought that before she died, Rao Yaoyao would have such a divine object on her that took the initiative to provide the Heavenly Unravel for her.</p><p>The heavenly gift was wasted on that woman!</p><p>If Hidden Bitter could do this, why would he need Fourth Sword and Flame Python? One sword could kill all the enemies in the world!</p><p>However, Rao Yaoyao didn’t even show this sword from the start of the battle.</p><p>She had always used Xuan Cang and only Xuan Cang…</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao, you’re really too smart!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt indignant about this nameless sword.</p><p>With his Witness Sword Technique, he could clearly see the most intense sorrow on this nameless first-grade sword that had died in form and will.</p><p>But…</p><p>How could it be possible?</p><p>Even if it was for this sword, he couldn’t really let Rao Yaoyao leave.</p><p>“Four Divine Pillars, help me!”</p><p>His heart roared crazily. Xu Xiaoshou tried his best to squeeze out the last traces of power to destroy the ultimate song of the Heavenly Unravel.</p><p>But…</p><p>It was in vain.</p><p>He had already reached his limit.</p><p>Even with the power of the Four Divine Pillars, it was difficult for it to render any more help to him…</p><p>After he forcefully received the power of the Holy Emperor, Xu Xiaoshou’s power faded at the moment, and his body began to disintegrate.</p><p>Even if he used his remaining strength that was used for repairs, it would not be enough to make up for this trend. How could he continue to export it?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, stop!”</p><p>Water Ghost’s solemn voice came from the secondary plane door above Dao Qiongcang’s head.</p><p>“You’ve reached your limit. Rao Yaoyao’s famed sword, Heavenly Unravel, had already left Abyss Island.”</p><p>“The power of the Four Divine Pillars will no longer be able to interfere with the power outside Abyss Island.”</p><p>“But our goal isn’t Rao Yaoyao. It’s Abyss Island. Remember that!”</p><p>Was the Saint Servant’s goal Abyss Island?</p><p>There weren’t many people left in the ruins of the First Hall of Sins after the strike by the Finger of Annihilation. When they heard the purpose stated so openly by Water Ghost, they all walked out amid the sorrowful song and felt bewildered.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was silent for a moment, and a fierce flame burned in his eyes, followed by a murderous intent.</p><p>It was still the same phrase…</p><p>Rao Yaoyao wasn’t worth it!</p><p>Even if it was for the nameless sword, he couldn’t just ignore it when he saw it. “The Four Divine Pillars can’t help me. Let me help myself!”</p><p>He raised his head, and with a roar, Xu Xiaoshou exerted all his strength and pulled out Hidden Bitter.</p><p>“Ahh!”</p><p>Under the boundless light, this black, twisted, and incomparably excited grade-five spiritual sword emitted a strange cry.</p><p>“Can you endure it?” Xu Xiaoshou lowered his head and asked.</p><p>“Waah!” The tip of Hidden Bitter’s body shook violently. As a nameless, famed sword with a spiritual body, it couldn’t bear the misery of that swan song.</p><p>Even though Hidden Bitter knew that it didn’t deserve it, it still wanted to hunt down the Saint.</p><p>“Then let’s go together!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou spun around, lifted Hidden Bitter, and threw it in the opposite direction as he leaped into the air.</p><p>Wuuu!</p><p>Hidden Bitter flew high into the sky, but it stabbed in the opposite direction.</p><p>Its speed increased with the distance. Finally, it carried Xu Xiaoshou together with the heavenly flame and chased after the Singer of the Stars and Moon, who had gone far away.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what are you up to now?”</p><p>At this moment, everyone was shocked.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had lost the power of the Four Divine Pillars and entered a state of exhaustion, used a nameless and useless fifth-grade spiritual sword to chase after Rao Yaoyao’s Heavenly Unravel.</p><p>Even if Rao Yaoyao wasn’t in a good state right now, she was still the sword saint Heavenly Unravel. She still had her special strengths.</p><p>Humph, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t have any external support. Wasn’t he afraid of being killed?</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao, have I agreed to your escape?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who rode the sword in the opposite direction, felt as if he had returned to the arena at the Tiansang Spirit Palace during the Windcloud Competition.</p><p>As for Rao Yaoyao, she was just the next enemy he was about to defeat in his life.</p><p>That was all!</p><p>He rode his sword and, with his sword power rising, flew higher into the sky. When he jumped into the spatial fragment, he had already used a Skill Point.</p><p>“Sword Technique Expertise Sovereign Stage Lv.10.”</p><p>“Sword Technique Expertise Holy Emperor Lv.o.”</p><p>Even if the difference was only by one level, it was a whole world of difference.</p><p>With a loud boom, Abyss Island resounded with the sound of thunder.</p><p>This time, it wasn’t a bolt of lightning out of a clear sky. Instead, after the sound of thunder, calamity clouds gathered.</p><p>“Saint calamity?”</p><p>Even Dao Qiongcang was confused.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was only at the Sovereign Dao Realm, so how could he set off the saint calamity?</p><p>What on earth did he do? What was he trying to do?</p><p>“Water Ghost!”</p><p>A loud shout came from the spatial fragment. Water Ghost was stunned for a moment, and then he realized something.</p><p>The secondary plane door bloomed in the sky. It opened and closed and the saint calamity was cut off instantly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had mastered the last level of the Sword Technique Expertise, could be said to be an ancient sword saint who had the purest foundation but could not cast a spell.</p><p>However…</p><p>Was there really nothing he could do with his sword skills?</p><p>In the dark spatial fragment, Xu Xiaoshou could see the Sword Will left behind by Rao Yaoyao, even without the help of the Four Divine Pillars.</p><p>He activated the Way of the Sword Disc under his feet, and the elegant demeanor of Master Siren’s sword style in the First Hall of Sins flashed in his mind.</p><p>“A wisp of remnant thought, nothing more.”</p><p>“I will kill her even if I have to go to the ends of the world!”</p><p>In just an instant, Xu Xiaoshou opened his eyes. There was no light in his eyes, no sadness, no joy, no intentions, and no waves.</p><p>On Abyss Island, from the spatial fragment, an intermittent voice spoke in the</p><p>Saint Language.</p><p>“Swordsmanship has a name. It’s called heart….”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
