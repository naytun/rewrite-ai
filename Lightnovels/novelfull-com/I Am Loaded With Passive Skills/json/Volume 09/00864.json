You pick the most important things to talk about and I’ll definitely not do anything to you. Of course, if you continue to play such a trick…” The expression in Yi’s eyes turned serious as he said in a cold voice, “Who are you?!”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s head buzzed and she felt dizzy again. She subconsciously wanted to tell him everything.</p><p>However, her eyes became hot again and she immediately woke up. She clamped her eyes tightly and cried, “You’ve said not to control my mind but why are you still doing it shamelessly? Can’t we have a good chat? Boohoo…”</p><p>Yi was stunned.</p><p>Even though they were so close to each other this time, he couldn’t detect how the little girl in front of him managed to control it.</p><p>There was not even the slightest spiritual source fluctuation.</p><p>But!</p><p>It was eliminated in an instant!</p><p>Was she born with an immunity to mental manipulation?</p><p>“Amazing!”</p><p>“You’re indeed not simple!”</p><p>Mu Zixi clattered like she was tossing beans. She covered her face, squatting down, and crying, “Don’t Mess with me. I didn’t do anything wrong. You should look for our Young Master Xu. He can answer your questions. Why did you look for me? I’m just a baby…”</p><p>Yi’s mouth twitched. Was this girl a chatterbox?</p><p>He said solemnly, “It’s because you didn’t do anything wrong that I didn’t interrogate you. I only asked questions…Get up!”</p><p>He pointed at Mu Zixi who was squatting in front of him. With a pull of his spiritual source, the little girl couldn’t help but stand up. Yi slowed down his pace and said gently, “So, let’s talk properly. I ask, you answer. Is that okay?”</p><p>Mu Zixi blinked her big eyes and suddenly asked, “Are you a stowaway? Did you disguise yourself? What’s your cultivation level?” “Guess?” Yi narrowed his eyes and his face turned a little ugly.</p><p>As if she did not see it, the little girl said thoughtlessly, “Then let’s fight? If I can’t beat You, you can ask whatever you want. If I can beat you, can you let me go… Hey, if I can beat you, then it’s my turn to ask you, right?”</p><p>Yi’s eyebrows twitched frantically.</p><p>He finally confirmed that this girl was not stalling for time but her brain was abnormal, and her train of thought was also problematic!</p><p>He straightened his body and said in a serious voice, “I’m a trial officer, Higher Void State.”</p><p>“Ugh!” Mu Zixi’s heart went cold, and the only hope she had left vanished into thin air. She obediently stood at attention and asked, “May I ask, what do you want to know?”</p><p>Just now, she had the thought of fighting to test the other party’s cultivation…</p><p>After all, Xu Xiaoshou had used a similar method to scare many big shots before!</p><p>Yi took a deep breath and gave up on the plan to attack.</p><p>He was actually not afraid of the other party stalling for time.</p><p>If the little girl in front of him really had a problem and was really stalling for time, then dragging out the crux of the problem would not be bad luck, but great luck.</p><p>A true expert was not afraid of any tricks.</p><p>After Yi exhaled, he was about to speak when Mu Zixi raised her hand first. “Hey, can I have a request?”</p><p>Yi choked, “Speak out!”</p><p>“Can you change back to your original appearance? Don’t use Young Master Xu’s voice to talk to me. I’m scared…” Mu Zixi timidly poked her finger.</p><p>Yi smiled and turned his head. He naturally took out a straw hat and changed into Elder Sang’s appearance. He put the hat on and said, “I don’t have my real appearance. I’m sorry…” The person who did it didn’t mean it. But the person who heard it meant it.</p><p>Yi’s words came to an abrupt end.</p><p>He was used to dealing with Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou in the past and had therefore taken up Sang Qiye’s appearance.</p><p>But the little girl in front of him, upon seeing his second appearance, actually narrowed her eyes and looked shocked!</p><p>Yi was only stunned for half a breath. As if he had understood something, murderous intent shot out of his eyes.</p><p>His withered hands reached out at the speed of light and directly grabbed the little girl’s shoulders. The voice that was like crawling out of the deepest hell whispered in her ear.</p><p>“You know me?!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
