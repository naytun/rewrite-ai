In just half a day, Xu Xiaoshou had made it into the top 10 of the point board. Even though the Eastern Region was very poor, it was unable to withstand the growth of the ‘Xu Gang’ like a tumor.</p><p>The Eastern Region had gone mad from the killing</p><p>All the individual fighters and small group trial takers had only two outcomes when they encountered the terrifying Xu Gang encirclement.</p><p>They could either run.</p><p>If they ran fast, they could avoid being plundered. If they ran slow, they would become members of the Xu Gang. In just half a day, the Xu Gang had grown from 70 to 500 odd people. The Five Tiger Generals initially disliked Young Master Xu’s style.</p><p>They didn’t even want to work hard.</p><p>But when the night fell, the five of them had completely changed their attitudes.</p><p>The Five Tiger Generals was famous now!</p><p>Under normal circumstances, with their strength, how could they control hundreds of subordinates?</p><p>But now, as long as they bumped into someone, Young Master Xu would make a move and that person would have no choice but to surrender. In the end, there was no longer a need for Young Master Xu to make a move.</p><p>Any one of the Five Tiger Generals simply ordered hundreds of the gang members to bombard the enemy. They didn’t even need to fight and the enemy would surrender directly.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, these are the newly dug cloud beads.”</p><p>At the barbeque area in front of the campfire, Tai Xing, one of the Five Tiger Generals, carried a ring and 16 cloud beads that he had just obtained.</p><p>He stared at the giant thunder bear paw roasting on the bonfire and the fragrance assailed his nostrils. He couldn’t help but swallow a mouthful of saliva.</p><p>“It smells so good. Young Master Xu came from a family of martial artists. Even my family’s chef doesn’t have such skills!”</p><p>Tai Xing was also a young genius. He was more than eight feet tall and had a well-proportioned body. He held a fifth-grade spiritual sword in his hand, and his bearing was extraordinary.</p><p>But after half a day, he could now call out ‘Young Master Xu’ very fluently. He didn’t feel the slightest bit of uncomfortableness.</p><p>“You’re here?” Xu Xiaoshou pointed to a spot beside Xin Gugu by the bonfire. He took over the ring, took out the cloud beads, and then said with a smile, “Sit down and eat together!”</p><p>Tai Xing squatted down excitedly and cut a piece of the giant thunder bear paw’s meat. He began to chew the meat beside Xin Gugu. The two guardians beside Young Master Xu were not ordinary people! The Master stage spiritual beast that they couldn’t defeat for a long time, they were killed almost in an instant the moment these two people attacked.</p><p>Just like this giant thunder bear which was close to the strength of the Master (stage), it had defeated the Xu Gang completely. When Brother Xin appeared, he directly defeated the giant thunder bear with a single palm. If one were to say that he didn’t have the strength of the Master (stage), Tai Xing would be the first to not believe it.</p><p>“It’s too delicious!”</p><p>As he chewed on the meat of the bear’s paw, Tai Xing felt extremely blissful. His face was full of fascination.</p><p>This meat was incomparably fresh and tender, and it also had a medicinal fragrance. It was simply a great tonic.</p><p>After half a day, everyone in the Xu Gang knew that the Way of the Sword wasn’t Young Master Xu’s specialty, but rather, conducting alchemy.</p><p>The person in front of him was the legendary fourth-grade Sovereign (stage) of conducting alchemy.</p><p>An ordinary portion of Master (stage) spiritual meat that was roasted under his hand, not only was it extremely fragrant, it also had the faint effects of the Master (stage) spiritual medicine.</p><p>The great tonic nature of the spiritual meat was brought to an unparalleled level by Young Master Xu.</p><p>“I’m about to break through…” after finishing a large piece of bear paw, Tai Xing felt that he could not suppress his cultivation level anymore and looked at Young Master Xu. “Break through then, I will be your guardian,” Xu Xiaoshou nodded with a smile.</p><p>Among the five generals, Tai Xing was the last with the Innate (stage) cultivation level.</p><p>The rest of them also couldn’t suppress their cultivation level after eating a few barbecue meals and broke through to the Master (stage) one after another.</p><p>Without the Master (stage) Heavenly Image State, they also couldn’t manage hundreds of young talents from the five regions.</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>Tai Xing nodded and sat down cross-legged.</p><p>Soon after…</p><p>The ocean of Qi rose, and the bonfire was burning</p><p>Dao revealed, and Heavenly Image formed. Tai Xing broke through to the Master (stage). “How is it?” Xu Xiaoshou asked curiously. Xin Gugu and Liu Changqing also turned their heads over. “Luckily, I didn’t disappoint you. It’s the Master (stage) Heavenly Image State… Peak!” Tai Xing was very excited. He suppressed his cultivation level for more than two years just for the Holy Palace Trial. Now in the Imperial City, with Young Master Xu’s promise to be in the top 36 of the point board, he was not worried at all.</p><p>The moment he broke through, he was at the Master (stage) Heavenly Image State. “Not bad. Including you, our Xu Gang has five Master (stage), Peak of the Heavenly Image State. Moreover, it’s only one step away from the Ying Yang State,” Xu Xiaoshou nodded his head in approval. There were rules in the Cloud Realm. As long as one did not get eliminated early and held on until the end, the top 36 of the point board would be stripped off the Master (stage) ability and return to the Innate (stage) at the beginning of the trial.</p><p>After that, the cultivators would obtain the ‘Cloud Realm Origin Crystal’. As long as they entered the Holy Palace Trial, they would be able to recover their peak cultivation level by swallowing the crystal. This was the benefit that Cheng Ji had obtained for the cultivators. Xu Xiaoshou was also confident that if he helped the Five Tiger Generals reach the top 36 of the rankings, it would naturally allow them to break through without any scruples. “In the future, if you find the treasures that can help you comprehend the Order of Dao, or when the rankings are stable, I will let you guys use the cloud bead first. I believe that the Ying Yang State is not far away,” Xu Xiaoshou smiled.</p><p>“Thank you, Young Master Xu!” Tai Xing was excited.</p><p>Everyone knew that Young Master Xu was not aiming to be the top of the point board.</p><p>All he wanted was to be at the top 10 of the ranking and create publicity to gather the people from the First Pavilion in the Sky to the Eastern Region.</p><p>Previously, everyone did not believe Young Master Xu’s words.</p><p>However, ever since that long message rushed into the top 10 of the ranking, everyone had believed him.</p><p>“Xiao Wanfeng, quickly come to the east to look for me…”</p><p>When Tai Xing thought of this cultivator’s name, he was speechless.</p><p>He really did not know what Young Master Xu was thinking when he inscribed his name this way. He also did not know what other people would feel when they saw Young Master Xu on the point board with such a name?</p><p>It was late at night now. The cultivators all over the Yunlun Mountain Range had stopped hunting spiritual beasts and searching for cloud beads. They began to rest and recuperate.</p><p>However, after resting for a while, when they glanced at the point board… “He has progressed again,” obviously someone had been following a particular person.</p><p>“He’s already in the top ten. He’s ranked ninth!”</p><p>“This is terrifying. Who Is this ‘Xiao Wanfeng, quickly come to the east to look for me? How could someone come up with such a name and make it to the point board so quickly?”</p><p>Clearly, Xu Xiaoshou’s long name was extremely eye-catching. “I noticed this name the moment he appeared in the top 9,000 on the rankings.” “I can’t help it, It’s too long. I even had to drag the display screen to see his full name. What a joke.”</p><p>“But I’ve never thought that such a funny name would rise from the top 9,000 to the ninth within half a day. It’s a thousand times faster!” someone sighed.</p><p>“Now everyone is starting to display their strength. This ‘Xiao Wanfeng, quickly come to the east to look for me’ can even reach ninth place. He is obviously the leader of a large group.”</p><p>“That’s right. I don’t know the name of the leader, but Xiao Wanfeng is going to become famous. Over 30,000 cultivators should have remembered his name!”</p><p>Under the starry night, all the places in the Yunlun Mountain Range were discussing ‘Xiao Wanfeng’.</p><p>Perhaps even Xiao Wanfeng wouldn’t have thought that the way he became famous was actually because someone else had used a name that was related to him.</p><p>In the north.</p><p>In a secluded cave, a purple-haired, shirtless young man stood with a heavy profound spear in his hand. He stared at the point board in his hand and didn’t speak for a long time.</p><p>“So powerful!” “I relied on the ‘Cloud Searching Wheel’ to find the cloud beasts and kill them. I’m far ahead of everyone on the point board. I didn’t expect this Xiao Wanfeng to be able to make it to the top 10 with the help of the cloud beads.” “How many people has he gathered to win with numbers?”</p><p>“If he were to encounter a few cloud beasts, wouldn’t my ranking as the number one be destroyed?” Chong Yuan, who was shirtless, broke out in laughter.</p><p>“That’s not right.”</p><p>“Even if he encounters a cloud beast, how many people in the entire Yunlun Mountain Range would be able to fight against it with its Sovereign (stage) realm and the cloud body that is unafraid of physical attacks?”</p><p>“Not everyone can reach the Star Worship State as soon as they break through!”</p><p>Chong Yuan walked out of the cave and looked at the starry sky with high spirits. He had suppressed his cultivation level for three years.</p><p>Who would have thought how he had endured such humiliation for the Holy Palace Trial during these three years? He wanted to fight everyone during this trip to the Yunlun Mountain Range.</p><p>“Xiao Wanfeng…”</p><p>“He, pray that you don’t bump into me!”</p><p>In the south.</p><p>Jiang Xian led more than 300 people to the valley of the Crescent Mountain.</p><p>A girl in a red dress with bandages wrapped around her body was sitting on the branches of a bald old locust tree. Only her two bright eyes were exposed.</p><p>Under the pale white full moon, she swayed her legs and let the bells at her ankles ring. It seemed that she was not afraid of the disaster that would be summoned by the bell in the night. “Duo Er of the Black Heart Fruit Clan.”</p><p>Jiang Xian looked into the distance and recognized the person. He stopped the person beside him from attacking. He shouted across the air, “Miss Duo Er, we are both descendants of Demi-Saint. Why don’t we join hands and conquer the Yunlun Mountain Range together?”</p><p>The sound was carried away by the wind floating in the air. There was no reply for a long time.</p><p>“Hmm, hmm, hmm…”</p><p>Duo Er, who was swaying on the branches, was still humming the lullaby of the Black Heart Fruit Clan. She was enjoying the smell of the night breeze and the smell of blood from the one-day battle in the Southern Region. She squinted her eyes and enjoyed the tranquility of the night.</p><p>“Miss Duo Er?”</p><p>“Hmm, hmm, hmm…” “Duo Er!”</p><p>“Hmm, hmm, hmm…”</p><p>Jiang Xian called out three times, but there was still no response. His expression turned ugly as he said loudly, “The Jiang Clan has the Demi-Saint pure light, We are not afraid of the Black Heart Gu passed down from the Black Heart Fruit Clan!” Duo Er’s ears twitched as her eyes shone. She tilted her head and said with a clear voice, “You want to fight with Duo Er?” Jiang Xian was stunned and said angrily, “Not fight, but work together!”</p><p>“Not interested, get lost, your name is not nice to hear. Duo Er does not want to work with you. Duo Er wants to work with this Xiao Wanfeng.” On the branches, the little girl pointed at the trial jade pendant with a burning gaze.</p><p>Jiang Xian was angered.</p><p>It was also his first time meeting the descendant of the Black Heart Fruit Clan. He didn’t expect her to be so childish. Her brain didn’t work like a normal person at all.</p><p>“Young Master Jiang, we can surround her and kill her directly!” someone at the side suggested. After a day, Duo Er was still ranked second on the point board. Everyone thought that this girl should have an army of trial takers under her.</p><p>They had never thought that when they went to Crescent Mountain, she was actually alone. Wasn’t this an opportunity?</p><p>Everyone was somewhat tempted.</p><p>The second rank’s points were too much for people to envy. Although it was shameful to use numbers to bully the weak in this battle, if they took down Duo Er, everyone’s path of the trial would be much easier.</p><p>“Stupid!” Jiang Xian shouted and cursed angrily, “I have the Jiang Clan’s Demi-Saint pure light, what do you have to resist her Black Heart Gu? Do you think we have the advantage in numbers?”</p><p>He pointed at the barren land, “This mountain is the battlefield of the Black Heart Fruit Clan. Once the battle begins, tens of thousands of Black Heart Gu will appear. Not to mention hundreds of Innate (stage) cultivators, even hundreds of Masters cultivators will be destroyed in an instant!”</p><p>Everyone’s hearts trembled when they heard this.</p><p>Tens of thousands of Black Heart Gu could instantly kill hundreds of Master (stage) cultivators?</p><p>What ability was this?</p><p>Were the people of the Southern Region all so strange and terrifying?</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Seeing that Duo Er refuse to collaborate, Jiang Xian turned around and was about to leave with his people.</p><p>At this moment, Duo Er, whose legs were swaying on the branches, asked with a smile across the air, “I met your main force this morning. Weren’t there more than 500 people? Why are there only so few people left?” Jiang Xian stopped in his tracks and his expression darkened. He didn’t want to explain but he was afraid that he would anger this little girl who had such a strange personality. Thus without turning his head, he said, “We met a madman with a sword. Let’s go!”</p><p>The second half of his sentence was directed at the main group. “A madman with a sword…”</p><p>On the old locus tree, Miss Duo Eer had her fingers crossed, and her tone was a little strange. She mumbled to herself, “You’re really amazing. You even dared to provoke a madman with a sword in the Eastern Region. On this Holy Sword Land of the Eastern Region, as long as a man is with a sword… Master said that even if it’s a mortal, he’s not to be trifled with.”</p><p>As she spoke, she raised her little fist and said excitedly, “But if it’s a Master (stage) or a Sovereign (stage), then we can kill him. The stronger your cultivation level is, the lower your swordsmanship will be!”</p><p>After saying that, she turned her gaze back to the jade pendant of trials and stared at the long list of names on it in a daze.</p><p>“Xiao Wanfeng, what a nice name…”</p><p>Duo Er curled her little index finger and muttered absent-mindedly, “I hope that you look like this name. The night is dark, and the night breeze is blowing. Otherwise… hmph!”</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>In other places, too many people were following the name ‘Xiao Wanfeng’. Some people from Dongtianwang City could recognize that it was the name inscribed by Young Master Xu at a glance, but most people who didn’t know took it ‘Xiao Wanfeng’ as a person’s name. As for Xiao Wanfeng himself, after seeing this name, he seemed to have found the last straw.</p><p>“The east…” Su Qianqian held the trial jade pendant and looked to the east.</p><p>“Young Master Xu is there!” Xiao Wanfeng was trembling as if he was treading on thin ice. He did not know why this little girl was looking for Young Master Xu, but no matter what, Young Master Xu would always be able to solve the problem brought to him.</p><p>Big Brother Shou was there… Su Qianqian smiled as she jumped down from the mountain rock and said, “We’ll travel by night to the East.”</p><p>“Uh, are you serious?” Xiao Wanfeng was shocked. This person was even more anxious than him?</p><p>However, traveling at night was too dangerous.</p><p>Hidden in the Yunlun Mountain Range were not only Innate (stage) and Master (stage) spiritual beasts.</p><p>To travel from the West to the East, one had to pass through the core region of the Nine Dragon Range. It was said that there were even Sovereign (stage) spiritual beasts in that place!</p><p>“Don’t be afraid, I’ll protect you.”</p><p>Su Qianqian turned her head and smiled as she continued to walk forward.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng sighed deeply.</p><p>What kind of people was she? None of the people who followed Young Master Xu were normal people. Now, even those who knew Young Master Xu had become so scary.</p><p>“Let’s go, let’s go. I hope nothing unexpected happens on the way to the East.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
