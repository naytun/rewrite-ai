He was afraid that he would be struck again and would be bewitched by Hua Ying to return to the Holy Palace for no reason.</p><p>“Tm your master’s brother now, but you must remember that you must not reveal my identity outside. You can just call me Young Master Xu.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou exhorted this girl who was not very bright, “As for why you came to the First Pavilion in the Sky, it was all because you liked my alchemy skills and were recruited on behalf of the Holy Palace.”</p><p>“Tm not stupid…” Hua Ying curled her lips.</p><p>Soon, she came back to her senses. It seemed that Uncle Xu didn’t have the intention to go back to the Holy Palace with her?</p><p>“You’re not going back?”</p><p>“Not for the time being.”</p><p>“Grandmaster Mu personally came for you, and you didn’t accept his offer?” Hua Ying was shocked.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head, “I still have things to do. At this stage, it’s not suitable for me to go back to the Holy Palace. But now that your mission has been completed, you can…”</p><p>“Tm not going back!” Hua Ying interrupted. She could tell that Uncle Xu was trying to chase her away.</p><p>However, she had only left the Holy Palace for a short period of time. She had been focusing on the mission and had not even had the time to enjoy it. How could she return now?</p><p>“My master said that after finding Uncle Xu, there are only two possibilities. First, he will bring you back to the Holy Palace. Second, if you don’t return to the Holy Palace, I will have to stay by your side and protect you.” Hua Ying said with a serious expression.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou became suspicious.</p><p>Protect me?</p><p>How daring are you? Your master is annoyed with your long life, isn’t he? He won’t allow you to return even after your mission is completed?</p><p>Protecting me means nothing more than helping the saint servant. What kind of master would give such an order?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately guessed that Hua Ying was lying.</p><p>However, he saw the girl’s expression of resistance. It was obvious that he couldn’t chase her back even if he forced her to. On the contrary, it would be very dangerous if she hid and followed him.</p><p>“alright, you should stay here for this period of time… No, stay at the headquarters of the Imperial City’s Alchemy Association. If you have nothing to do, don’t come to the First Pavilion in the Sky.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou actually wanted to keep Hua Ying. After all, if they were too far apart from one another, who knew what this young lady would tell others.</p><p>However, on second thought, it was not difficult to find out Hua Ying’s identity.</p><p>Amessenger from the Holy Palace who had nothing to do and stayed at the First Pavilion in the Sky all day long just to recruit someone?</p><p>‘There must be something fishy going on here!</p><p>Who would have thought that Hua Ying would not care about this? She shook her head like a rattle-drum. “I don’t care. I want to stay by Uncle Xu’s side.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly had a headache.</p><p>This girl was just a child who could not grow up. Her body was mature, but her mind was mostly playful.</p><p>Obviously, the hotbed of the Holy Palace had protected her too well. She did not realize what kind of risks she would encounter if she stayed at the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>“No!” Thinking of this, Xu Xiaoshou sternly refused.</p><p>Hua Ying leaned against the big bathtub, ignoring him. “No, no. I must obey master’s orders.” She looked like a dead pig that was not afraid of boiling water.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou painfully closed his eyes.</p><p>This annoying junior nephew…</p><p>“Like this!”</p><p>He suddenly waved his hand and sent a telepathic communication to his junior sister.</p><p>‘Mu Zixi immediately ran down from upstairs.</p><p>‘The little loli was extremely curious about the commotion in the hall on the first floor. However, Xu Xiaoshou had opened the Eight Trigrams Pilgrimage Map, so she and Xin Gugu couldn’t hear anything even if they were lying on the floor.</p><p>Now that her senior brother had allowed her to interfere in the conversation, she was naturally extremely happy.</p><p>However, when she came down the stairs, Mu Zixi saw Hua Ying.</p><p>She walked over step by step and compared the two of them. She realized that the other party was much older than her, not just in terms of age… her smile immediately disappeared bit by bit.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, why are you calling me?” Mu Zixi came to the side of the two of them unhappily.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened the Eight Trigrams Pilgrimage Map again. This time, he only isolated Xiao Wanfeng. He also showed the content of the conversation to Xin Gugu, who was lying on the ground on the second floor, and Mo Mo, who pricked up her ears but pretended not to be interested.</p><p>He pointed at Hua Ying and introduced, “The descendant of the infernal lineage of the Holy Palace, the grand-disciple of Elder Sang’s junior brother, is here to recognize her kin.”</p><p>‘Mu Zixi immediately opened her small mouth, somewhat stunned.</p><p>‘The two upstairs were also surprised. Recognize her kin? Recognize Xu Xiaoshou as her kin? What happens after she recognizes her kin?</p><p>Hua Ying slightly puffed out her chest, a proud look on her face. “I’m Uncle Xu’s junior nephew. I came here to bring him back to the Holy Palace, but he doesn’t want to go back for the time being, so I can only stay here.”</p><p>The two people upstairs immediately let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>‘Mu Zixi also let out a sigh of relief, temporarily putting down her hanging heart.</p><p>“Uncle Xu, what about her? Who is she?” Hua Ying asked back, her tone a little arrogant.</p><p>In her opinion, after recognizing her kin, she was the closest person to Uncle Xu.</p><p>Regardless of how long these people from the First Pavilion in the Sky had followed Uncle Xu and how close they were, they would never be as close as the words “Infernal lineage”.</p><p>And the person in front of her, that Uncle Xu had called down to let her know, was clearly the closest between the two of them.</p><p>Acouple?</p><p>Isn’t she a little too young? Is she an adult yet?</p><p>Hua Ying’s thoughts ran wild.</p><p>“Conjecture, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou slapped the girl’s forehead in annoyance. “I told you to call me Young Master Xu outside. Don’t develop a bad habit. In the future, you’ll easily expose my identity.”</p><p>“Oh, oh!” Hua Ying’s head shrunk. She dared to be angry but didn’t dare to say anything.</p><p>In the past, no one dared to slap her like that except for her master. But now that she has Uncle Xu, she couldn’t say anything because of the pressure of seniority.</p><p>“Who is she?” Hua Ying looked at Mu Zixi again with a look of comparison in her eyes.</p><p>Hua Ying was naturally competitive and her Uncle Xu’s attitude toward this little loli was clearly not as rude to her. She was a little unconvinced.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but look at Mu Zixi as well. He opened his mouth to introduce her, but the corners of his mouth suddenly twitched. He wanted to say something, but he stopped himself.</p><p>“You’re Young Master Xu’s martial nephew?” At this moment, Mu Zixi also reacted. There was a funny look in her eyes.</p><p>“Uh-huh, what’s wrong?” Hua Ying puffed out her chest.</p><p>‘Mu Zixi narrowed her eyes and slapped Xu Xiaoshou angrily. “Tell her who I am. Tell her not to raise her head and puff out her chest in front of me in the future. It’s distracting!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou started to feel uncomfortable. He pointed at his junior sister and introduced her with a headache. “Strictly speaking, this is also your master’s sister. She is your Grandmaster Sang’s second disciple.”</p><p>Hua Ying’s arrogant gaze froze and gradually turned into shock. Finally, a clear question mark appeared on her face.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“This is your master’s sister, Mu Zixi.” Xu Xiaoshou’s tone became heavier.</p><p>“Uncle Xu, are you joking?” Hua Ying looked at the little loli with twin ponytails in shock.</p><p>This little girl looked like she was still underage.</p><p>How could she be my master’s sister?</p><p>Master’s brother is young and Hua Ying acknowledged that.</p><p>At the Night Spirit Gem Trade Fair, she had witnessed the scene of Uncle Xu fighting against the higher void and sword deity. She was stunned and couldn’t help but think that he did deserve to be referred to as Uncle Xu.</p><p>But this little girl…</p><p>Hua Ying’s head was about to split open.</p><p>She was also one of the most outstanding talents among the younger generation in the Holy Palace. How could she call such a little girl master’s sister?</p><p>‘Mu Zixi was extremely happy at this moment. Her little canines were shining brightly. “You don’t have to call me master’s sister. Just call me Mu Zixi. I entered the sect late, so I shouldn’t have entered the sect earlier than your master.”</p><p>Her explanation was brilliant, but when Hua Ying heard it, she felt like breaking out in cold sweat.</p><p>It was very difficult for her to say it out loud.</p><p>However, the infernal lineage valued seniority very much.</p><p>‘When Hua Ying was in the Holy Palace, she didn’t think much of addressing the middle-aged and old people like her master, Grandmaster, and Great Grandmaster as seniors.</p><p>But after coming out, how did the situation suddenly change?</p><p>Calling a little girl as master’s sister?</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou also felt that something was wrong.</p><p>But what he was thinking was that perhaps Hua Ying’s master, or rather, Mu Ling, didn’t even know when he, Xu Xiaoshou, had taken Elder Sang as his master. Mu Ling might even think that he was a middle-aged man, so when Hua Ying came.. that was why she would subjectively call him master’s</p><p>brother instead of Uncle Xu.</p><p>But now, he was too lazy to correct these things.</p><p>“Hua Ying, you should follow Mu Zixi for this period of time. The two of you should remember not to act rashly. It’s best if you change your appearance. If anything goes wrong, Hua Ying, you should return to the Holy Palace early!” Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand, he didn’t want to care about this anymore.</p><p>Hua Ying wasn’t stupid.</p><p>She could immediately tell that Uncle Xu was unhappy that she didn’t call her master’s sister. She immediately put down her pride and bowed deeply. “Hello, master’s sister. Hua Ying greets master’s sister.”</p><p>After saying that, she felt that her teeth were aching. This was too… that!</p><p>‘Mu Zixi’s heart was filled with joy. Calling her master’s sister made her very happy.</p><p>Immediately, she looked at Hua Ying with a very amiable gaze.</p><p>It’s good that you’ve come. It’s best if you have a few more martial nephews. Then, I can learn how Xu Xiaoshou manages his juniors.</p><p>“Little Hua Ying?”</p><p>“Master’s sister…”Hua Ying raised her head, thinking that Mu Zixi had some instructions.</p><p>“Little Hua Ying?” Mu Zixi had a smile on her face.</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Little Hua Ying?”</p><p>Hua Ying finally realized that this ponytailed loli was immersed in the joy of having another martial nephew.</p><p>Hua Ying immediately became sad.</p><p>“Little Hua Ying, let’s go and have a chat with me. Let me tell you, this place is actually quite stuffy. I don’t even know why you’re here, but since you’re here, you should take it easy. Don’t leave during this period of time…” Mu Zixi said to Hua Ying as she headed to the second floor.</p><p>She really did feel stuffy staying here.</p><p>Other than Mo Mo, who was of the same sex, Xu Xiaoshou was the only one who could chat on a daily basis.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou often went into seclusion and didn’t come out. He would either go out alone to create trouble or act alone.</p><p>Leaving Mu Zixi alone…and Mo Mo is very quiet. Mu Zixi did not have anyone to talk to and was bored to death.</p><p>It is fine now.</p><p>‘The infernal lineage has a martial niece who is planning to stay in the First Pavilion in the Sky. This is great!</p><p>Hua Ying didn’t dare to resist and could only give her Uncle Xu a pleading look.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou ignored her.</p><p>If you knew this would happen, why did you do it in the first place?</p><p>Your master’s sister, Mu Zixi has the Devil’s genes in her bones. She used to suck people’s life force. You didn’t leave when I told you to. Now, you have to pray for yourself!</p><p>Seeing the little loli walking out with Hua Ying in her arms, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly noticed something.</p><p>This isn’t right!</p><p>Would something happen if these two walked together?</p><p>One of them is a demon seed, and the other is an explosive descendant…</p><p>“Hey, you two better not cause any trouble. I’m telling you, this is a critical moment…” Xu Xiaoshou shouted.</p><p>“Got it!”</p><p>Mu Zixi waved her hand indifferently. After taking a few steps away from Hua Ying, she suddenly thought of something, “Let’s go, let’s go. The First Pavilion in the Sky is very boring. I’l take you shopping. During this period of time, your sister Mo and I have visited many places, but she’s very boring. You</p><p>shouldn’t have had enough fun in Dongtianwang City, right?”</p><p>Hua Ying hesitated for a moment. She wanted to play, but not with the unfamiliar master’s sister, but with Uncle Xu.</p><p>How could Mu Zixi not know Hua Ying’s fear? She was very shrewd, she immediately lowered her voice. “Let me tell you, although you caused a great deal of displeasure for us at the Spirit Gem Trade Fair, it does not matter much to me…”</p><p>Hua Ying was nervous.</p><p>‘Mu Zixi continued, “Come with me. I’ll tell you something interesting about your master’s brother. He’s very stupi</p><p>She wanted to talk about this?</p><p>Hua Ying immediately became excited. Her gossipy heart was instantly ignited. She suddenly felt that it wasn’t a bad thing to follow Mu Zixi.</p><p>At least, she seemed to know a lot of master’s brother’s stories?</p><p>“You two!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was at the back, was already unable to ridicule them.</p><p>The seniority relationship between a master’s sister and a martial nephew had already been messed up. Their age and even their height were messed up. How was it possible that they suddenly have a common topic to talk about?</p><p>“Don’t get into trouble…” He looked at the two girls who were gradually disappearing from the entrance of the First Pavilion in the Sky, and his heart suddenly ached.</p><p>He hoped that there wouldn’t be any blind people who would provoke these two demons.</p><p>He prays nothing will happen to them, the citizens of the imperial city.</p><p>Hua Ying found her master’s brother and bought an additional master’s sister. The two of them went to play by themselves, and Xu Xiaoshou didn’t care too much about it.</p><p>He only asked Xin Gugu to keep an eye on them, and then dropped the matter.</p><p>After the grand meeting of alchemy ended, he obtained the jade pendant from the trial.</p><p>Next, he had to start preparing for the Imperial City Trial.</p><p>The Abyss Island was still hanging above his head. The short period of peace would not make Xu Xiaoshou lose himself. He only felt an even greater sense of oppression.</p><p>During this period of time, Xu Xiaoshou did not plan to cause any trouble.</p><p>He wanted to observe from the Pearl Towel of the First Pavilion in the Sky and see the various groups of people hiding in the Imperial City. Then, he would plan to prevent any accidents that might occur during the Imperial City Trial.</p><p>“Saint servant, Yama, Red-clothed, white-clothed, ghost beast that might exist, as well as other unstable factors…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered and felt that his brain was not working enough.</p><p>At this moment, he couldn’t see through the big shots’ plans at all. He could only take one step at a time.</p><p>“Fortunately, I’m a master now!”</p><p>Having a cultivation level of a master gave Xu Xiaoshou a lot of confidence. The ability of two bottles of Saint Blood and Virtual Image, and the Saint Satue gave him a trump card to deal with the almighty personally.</p><p>But this was clearly not enough.</p><p>“With the Imperial City Trial coming up, it will be good to increase my cultivation level even if it’s a little by little. Since I have stealth now, there’s no need to suppress my cultivation level.”</p><p>“The next step is to start with this thing.”</p><p>After returning to the cultivation room, Xu Xiaoshou took out the reward for the champion of the alchemy competition.</p><p>Little Blue Flower of the Tranquil Lake.</p><p>A green, enchanting flame was burning in the bamboo lantern.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at this small Heavenly Flame for a long time, and his heart started to throb.</p><p>He had a premonition.</p><p>If this thing was swallowed into his body, it might clash with the Three Days Frozen Calamity and bring out the true power of the Heavenly Flame!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
