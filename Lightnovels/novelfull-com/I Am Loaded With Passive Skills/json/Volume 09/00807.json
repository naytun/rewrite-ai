On the contrary, I had located him and was wondering when I could get rid of this secret agent of the Path Division! I didn’t expect this kid to have come personally. It could be considered a coincidence!” Liu Changqing said with confidence.</p><p>After becoming a ghost beast host body, he had taken the Holy Divine Palace as an imaginary enemy. He would kill them whenever he could. Of course, it would be best if he could do it quietly.</p><p>Hearing this only then did Xiaoshou realize how powerful Patriarch Wuji was.</p><p>In just a few days, he could actually make a Cutting Path who was completely new to the Divine Secret be able to suppress a genius of the Path Division?</p><p>“Let’s see him.”</p><p>He immediately agreed with a smile.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng immediately ran back to the door and welcomed Situ Yongren in.</p><p>“Young Master Xu.”</p><p>The moment he entered, Situ Yongren, who had a refined temperament and humble look, cupped his fists. “I’ve heard a lot about you. I’m Situ Yongren. I hope I haven’t been too abrupt to visit you today.”</p><p>‘As he spoke, Situ Yongren sized up the young man in front of him.</p><p>He was handsome, but in the world of spiritual cultivation, he was not different from others. Other than a bit of cynicism at the corner of his mouth, he could not sense the slightest demeanor of the Demi-Saint Descendant from Young Master Xu.</p><p>Is he Young Master Xu?</p><p>Situ Yongren pondered in his heart.</p><p>This visit was actually under Sword Deity Rao’s instruction.</p><p>Within a few days, red-clothed people had used most of the power of the Holy Divine Palace to investigate everything related to the Taixiang Xu family in the Northern Region.</p><p>But it was futile.</p><p>Not to mention the Taixiang Xu family, the Holy Divine Palace could not even find half a suspicious Demi-Saint faction from the Xu family.</p><p>The red-clothed people felt strange.</p><p>Young Master Xu was hiding it too well.</p><p>Some people had questioned the authenticity of Young Master Xu’s Demi-Saint Descendant, but Sword Deity Rao rejected them all.</p><p>According to Sword Deity Rao, even Master Siren had some connection with Young Master Xu.</p><p>Therefore, even if on the surface Young Master Xu was not found to be a descendant of the Demi-Saint, the faction behind him was so powerful that it was at the Demi-Saint stage at the very least.</p><p>Allin all, Young Master Xu’s identity as a Demi-Saint descendant was confirmed. Therefore, the series of plans that she had previously made against Young Master Xu was forced to be halted temporarily.</p><p>The red-clothed people had officially stopped their investigation of Young Master Xu.</p><p>However, even though they had stopped their investigation, Rao Yaoyao still had some doubts in her heart.</p><p>Therefore, Situ Yong’s mission this time was to secretly probe Young Master Xu’s identity as a Demi-Saint descendant by befriending him.</p><p>And if he wanted to probe secretly, with Young Master Xu’s impeccable skills, it was useless to just use words. Only Divine Secret was the ultimate skill.</p><p>This was also the reason why only Situ Yongren could accept the mission.</p><p>“Only you alone?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was also sizing up Situ Yong.</p><p>He could recognize this person. During the night battle in the Imperial City that day, he was standing beside Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou was not interested in this genius of the Path Division.</p><p>After waiting for a while, when he didn’t see a woman walk out from behind this young man who was from the Path Division as he wished, he frowned slightly.</p><p>During the night battle in the Imperial City, he saw Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>Although they did not meet face to face, he had seen Xiao Yu with his ‘Perception’ and knew that Xiao Yu had been paying attention to him.</p><p>Although they were currently opposing each other and it was not suitable for the two to get to know each other, Xu Xiaoshou had many doubts could not ask.</p><p>However, with Young Master Xu’s identity, he was quite willing to have a wonderful encounter with her.</p><p>However, the man in front of him had come alone and did not even bring a gift. How could he have the face to come here?</p><p>Situ Yongren was stunned. He did not understand Young Master Xu’s question and asked, “It’s only me, Young Master Xu. Do you have any questions?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou instantly smiled, and a teasing smile appeared on his face.</p><p>“Ihave heard that there is a woman in the Path Division of the Holy Divine Palace. She wears a veil all year round and no one can see her appearance. However, with just a pair of eyes, she was ranked among the top ten most beautiful women in the world. Did she not come with you?” As he spoke, he raised</p><p>his eyebrows, showing an expression that said, ‘We’re all men, you know what I mean.’</p><p>Situ Yongren’s mouth twitched. He had long heard that Young Master Xu was a good-for-nothing, but he did not expect it to be this extent!</p><p>In front of him, he was so openly thinking about his junior sister?</p><p>No matter how good her temper was, Situ Yongren could not hold it in any longer. “Young Master Xu, please have some self-respect. My junior sister has a mission and is temporarily stationed in the Holy Divine Palace. I’m only here to befriend you…”</p><p>“Befriend me?” Xu Xiaoshou interrupted with a look of disdain. “I don’t like to befriend men. If your junior sister doesn’t come, please leave. I still have things to do, so I won’t send you off.”</p><p>Situ Yong’s face turned dark with anger.</p><p>What kind of person was this!</p><p>Which Demi-Saint’s descendant would have said such a thing? Didn’t he have the upbringing of the Demi-Saint clan?</p><p>“Young Master Xu…”</p><p>“Didn’t you hear clearly? I don’t want to interact with you. Please go back!” Xu Xiaoshou frowned as if he was rejecting the olive branch offered by the various major factions.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng, who was beside him, was dumbfounded.</p><p>He saw Situ Yongren’s extraordinary demeanor and felt that he should be someone important.</p><p>‘When he heard Young Master Xu and Situ Yong mention the Path Division, Xiao Wanfeng vaguely felt that the name ‘Situ Yongren’ was a little familiar.</p><p>After a short while, he recalled who this person was. He was actually the disciple of the Hallmaster Dao.</p><p>But even though he was the disciple of the Hallmaster Dao, Young Master Xu was still so domineering!</p><p>He did not give him any face at all!</p><p>Situ Yong was shut off and could not come back to his senses for a long time.</p><p>This was an experience that he never had before. In the past, if he were to go to any Demi-Saint faction, who would not show respect to him as the next-in-line chief of the Path Division?</p><p>However, the First Pavilion in the Sky had ignored his identity at all.</p><p>He did not think that Young Master Xu did not know who he, Situ Yongren, was. After all, this guy even knew his junior sister.</p><p>And Young Master Xu was still so rude even though he knew. This really angered him.</p><p>A fool!</p><p>Situ Yongren cursed in his heart. No Demi-Saint’s descendant dared to offend him, the favored son of the Path Division. However, he had a mission, so he had no choice but to be shameless and hope to stay.</p><p>The secret weapon of the Path Division, the Heart of the Truth, was hung around his neck like a pendant. Situ Yongren had to talk to Young Master Xu to gather some information.</p><p>The Heart of the Truth was like a lie detector.</p><p>‘As long as there was interaction, when it came to business, Situ Yongren could get the true answers he wanted through Young Master Xu’s words, emotions, movements, and anything at all.</p><p>But now, before he could even interact with him, Young Master Xu had chased him away just because he didn’t bring his junior sister over?</p><p>What the hell was this!</p><p>Situ Yongren was mad, but he quickly calmed his emotions on the surface. He then said gently, “I’ve long heard that Young Master Xu is a young hero with high spirits, and your behavior is different from others. Today, I’ve seen that Young Master Xu is indeed different from ordinary people. You’re a</p><p>gentleman that worth befriending.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked when he heard that.</p><p>This Situ Yongren refused to leave and even flattered him?</p><p>There must be something!</p><p>He wouldn’t visit him for no reason. Xu Xiaoshou did not have any contact with this Situ Yongren before, so he did not think that he could recognize him as Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>So this guy still wanted to stay here shamelessly. Could it be that he came here with some mission?</p><p>Initially, he just did not want to talk to this guy, but now, Xu Xiaoshou was even more reluctant to interact with him.</p><p>He had experienced the Divine Secret technique before. Other than being mysterious, it was still mysterious.</p><p>Although the Weaving Expertise was at the Sovereign stage, and it could break the Divine Secret technique, Xu Xiaoshou really could not obtain some of the abilities of the Divine Secret technique that he had never understood before from the Weaving Expertise.</p><p>He could only learn the Weaving technique from it…</p><p>With a thought, Xu Xiaoshou had an answer. He waved his hand and turned around to leave. “Xiao Wanfeng, see the guest out.”</p><p>“Ah?” Xiao Wanfeng was stunned.</p><p>Situ Yongren was also stunned. He had praised him to this extent, and Young Master Xu still did not want him to stay?</p><p>“Mr, Situ, please!” After coming back to his senses, Xiao Wanfeng did not hesitate at all. He bowed and was about to invite him out of the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>Situ Yong could not hold it in any longer. He flung his sleeves angrily and said, “Young Master Xu, I came here personally to befriend you, yet you don’t even give me face. Since that’s the case, let’s meet again in the Imperial City Trial!”</p><p>“Imperial City Trial?”</p><p>Hearing this, Xu Xiaoshou stopped his footsteps. He tuned around and sized him up. “Your cultivation level seemed to have exceeded the Master (stage)?”</p><p>“Hmph!” Situ Yongren’s expression turned haughty, and he did not reply.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, he is the head of the Spiritual Array Conference. Just like you, he should be participating in the Imperial City trial with a special identity,” Liu Changqing said via telepathic communication.</p><p>The head of the Spiritual Array Conference?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was astonished. After a long while, he laughed out loud. “You’re not bad. You’re the favored son of the Path Division, and you’re using the Divine Secret technique to bully the Spiritual Array Casters.”</p><p>Situ Yongren was originally full of pride, Hearing this, his face turned dark.</p><p>If it wasn’t for other reasons, how could he lower his status to participate in that Spiritual Array Conference?</p><p>However, at this moment, the two of them were competing against each other. Situ Yong wasn’t a pushover either. “Isn’t Young Master Xu the same? You’re a third-grade alchemy Sovereign, but you’re actually competing with those little alchemy masters.”</p><p>“No,” Xu Xiaoshou smiled and waved his hand. “Conducting alchemy is just an incidental skill of mine. I just learn it occasionally, but the Divine Secret is your specialty. It can’t be compared apple to apple.”</p><p>Situ Yongren was speechless.</p><p>He had not been retorted so badly for a long time.</p><p>Or rather, since he was born, no one had dared to mock him in this manner.</p><p>At this juncture, he actually could not find anything suitable to refute Young Master Xu. He could only become angrier, and then he flung his sleeves and left.</p><p>“Twon’t send you off,” Xu Xiaoshou waved at Situ Yong’s back and laughed.</p><p>Situ Yongren didn’t even reply. His face was dark as he was forced to go back.</p><p>Mission?</p><p>This Young Master Xu didn’t even have the most basic respect for people. What mission was Situ Yongren thinking about?</p><p>He didn’t make a move on the spot and cut this guy into pieces. It was already considered the basic courtesy of a big faction.</p><p>As for bringing his junior sister here as requested by Young Master Xu and to continue with his mission?</p><p>What bullsh*t joke was this!</p><p>Situ Yong recalled that fellow’s oily eyes and felt a wave of disgust. How could he bring his junior sister here to be humiliated?</p><p>“Interesting, really interesting,</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou watched Situ Yong leave and the corners of his lips curled up.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, do you need my help to kill him directly?” Liu Changging asked with his head lowered. His expression was somewhat serious.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at him and refused with a smile, “There’s no need for that. He didn’t do anything wrong. Instead, he was bullied. He should be the one who wants to kill him.”</p><p>Liu Changqing secretly heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>He was obviously joking.</p><p>Situ Yongren, the disciple of the Hallmaster Dao.</p><p>If it were a normal day, Liu Changging naturally didn’t want to offend this person.</p><p>However, he knew that although Young Master Xu looked like a good-for-nothing, he was actually very smart. He should know the consequences of killing this person.</p><p>Since Young Master Xu would not let him kill anyone, then it would not stop Liu Changqing from expressing his loyalty in front of Young Master Xu.</p><p>“Did Young Master Xu say that this person is interesting?”Liu Changqing recalled what Young Master Xu had said just now.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not tricked by Situ Yongren. However, after a seemingly meaningless argument, he could figure out the intention of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>After a few exchanges with Situ Yongren, he had guessed that he was Dao Qiongcang’s top disciple.</p><p>Did such a person need to go through the Imperial City Trial and the Holy Palace Trial to enter the Holy Palace to cultivate?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that it was impossible. There was probably not a single person in the Holy Palace who could teach Situ Yongren the Divine Secret technique.</p><p>But this fellow actually participated in the Spiritual Array Convention and was heading towards the Imperial City Trial…</p><p>“Interesting.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled.</p><p>Even though he felt that Situ Yongren’s action was extremely demeaning, Situ Yongren was still doing it. Why?</p><p>“He said he would see me at the Imperial City Trial, which means that he will participate in the Imperial City Trial. However, the Imperial City Trial can’t possibly attract Hallmaster Dao’s disciple. What is his motive?</p><p>“Abyss Island!</p><p>“This fellow’s actual focus is definitely on Abyss Island.</p><p>“But on the surface, the Holy Palace has the same status as the Holy Divine Palace. They can’t allow a Sovereign expert to break the rules of the Imperial City Trial on the eve of the Holy Palace Trial in the name of the Imperial City Trial.</p><p>“But even so, the Holy Divine Palace is still doing i</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fell into deep thought.</p><p>He was thinking how many Sovereigns would use such a title to sneak into the Imperial City Trial?</p><p>Or rather…</p><p>During the Imperial City Trial, those whose cultivation level had surpassed the Innate (stage) would not be able to interfere with the trial.</p><p>Then, what should the Holy Divine Palace do to allow more contestants who had surpassed the Sovereign to sneak into the trial and protect the Abyss Island that they wanted to protect?</p><p>“Interesting.</p><p>“Truly interesting!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly thought of something. In the past, his knowledge was shallow and he did not think that many geniuses around him would participate in the Imperial City Trial with the cultivation level of Master (stage) or Sovereign.</p><p>However, after meeting Situ Yongren, he suddenly realized.</p><p>Perhaps in the five domains of the continent, quite many people participated in the Imperial City Trial with the cultivation level of Master (stage) or the strength of Sovereign (stage).</p><p>After all, across the five regions, there were countless geniuses.</p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Xiaoshou no longer feared the future. On the contrary, he was looking forward to the Imperial City Trial that was going to take place in a few more days..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
