He was attracted by her tightly shut eyes that were emitting black and white mist.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Patriarch Wuji, in the sea of white flowers of Reborn Lily, was also at a loss.</p><p>However, he was different from Yi. He had once stayed on Abyss Island and came into close contact with the highest level of power — divine power!</p><p>And now, the little girl that he had abandoned, after being fainted for a short while, a wisp of divine power was released from her body.</p><p>It wasn’t an illusion!</p><p>It was really divine power!</p><p>It was just a wisp, but who was Patriarch Wuji? He had seen such power before!</p><p>“I, what have I done…”</p><p>Immediately, Patriarch Wuji was filled with regret.</p><p>He finally realized that Mu Zixi’s status was different from others.</p><p>Perhaps, just like Xu Xiaoshou, this little girl was also someone who had been secretly groomed by Bazhun’an.</p><p>But now, because of a personal grudge, he had messed up the plan of Bazhun’an?</p><p>“Crazy!</p><p>“Why didn’t anyone tell me this person is so important?!</p><p>“But…”</p><p>Patriarch Wuji’s face turned pale.</p><p>His mind went blank, and his lips quivered. He wanted to say something, and then do something to make up for it.</p><p>However, at this juncture, he realized that he couldn’t even figure out what was going on with the little girl, so how could he do anything?</p><p>On the other end….</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was the nearest to him, suddenly felt refreshed the moment the divine power bloomed. The demonic Qi in his body was completely suppressed, and his eyes regained their clarity.</p><p>“Whale Fall?”</p><p>He looked at the unusual magnificent sea of Reborn Lily, for some reason, this phrase appeared in his mind. “A whale falls, and all creatures come to life.”</p><p>Wasn’t this the scene right now?</p><p>Mu Zixi had yet to awaken, and the power that spread out from her body had caused the mountains to bloom into a sea of flowers, and the birds and beasts to be extremely happy.</p><p>But…</p><p>“What about Junior Sister?</p><p>“Junior Sister, you can’t fall!</p><p>“Didn’t they say that Holy Blood of the Infernal Lineage is like the blessing of God, and it can instantly heal injuries of any level?”</p><p>Xu Xiao was anxious.</p><p>He had fed her Holy Blood.</p><p>However, in his Perception, most of the power of Holy Blood had gathered in Mu Zixi’s body, but it didn’t have any healing effect.</p><p>No!</p><p>Xu Xiao’s pupils constricted.</p><p>After his consciousness cleared up, he discovered the true profoundness within Mu Zixi’s body.</p><p>She wasn’t injured at all!</p><p>In other words, Mu Zixi’s injuries on the surface and inside her body had been healed by the power of Holy Blood very much earlier, but she had yet to awaken.</p><p>And this had only used less than one-thousandth of the power of the Holy Blood.</p><p>The reason why Xu Xiaoshou could use up the power of a drop of Holy Blood was that he had opened the Saint Statue.</p><p>Only Holy Blood and the Saint Statue could perfectly offset the input against the output.</p><p>But now, Mu Zixi’s body didn’t have any energy output at all. There was only input.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the specially treated Holy Blood of the Infernal Lineage that didn’t have any side effects, the vigorous power would have probably destroyed her Life Force.</p><p>“No injuries…</p><p>“And this strange divine power…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoyu muttered to himself as if he had realized something, and his pupils started to tremble.</p><p>He looked at Mu Zixi’s eyes.</p><p>He lost control of his emotions before this, so he didn’t observe such details. But now that he had calmed down, he finally noticed something unusual.</p><p>In this world that was filled with the white divine power of the Reborn Lily, everything should have been sanctified and purified.</p><p>However, at the position of Mu Zixi’s right eye, there was still a black demonic Qi that was out of place.</p><p>That demonic Qi…</p><p>Didn’t seem to have the demonic Qi of the Fourth Sword which mainly focused on the power of murder.</p><p>On the contrary…</p><p>It was ultimate Yin, evil, and dark.</p><p>That was the real demonic Qi!</p><p>“God Devil Eyes?” Xu Xiaoshou’s head buzzed.</p><p>He thought of another voice in Mu Zixi’s body.</p><p>That seemed to be the second personality of his junior sister?</p><p>Could it be…</p><p>“Hmm!”</p><p>At this moment, Mu Zixi suddenly let out a painful groan, interrupting Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts.</p><p>Clearly, all the powers in her body didn’t interact, but she seemed to be enduring some kind of pain. Her small face was wrinkled, and her body was gradually trembling.</p><p>“Kaa…” her teeth knocked against each other.</p><p>“Uh uh…” she cried out in pain.</p><p>After that…</p><p>“Ah ah ah!!!”</p><p>Along with mournful cries of pain, Mu Zixi’s entire body was bent upwards. Without any external support, her body floated in the air.</p><p>“Ah ah ah ah ah…”</p><p>In the sea of Reborn Lily flowers, a cry of unbearable pain rang out.</p><p>Xu Xiaoahou was completely flustered.</p><p>He didn’t know what had happened to his junior sister either.</p><p>And just as the cries of pain reached an extreme, Mu Zixi’s body, which had been arched up out of thin air, suddenly stopped trembling</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>She opened her eyes, and the black and white eyeballs spun at high speed, emitting endless black and white mist.</p><p>The divine power in the world came to a halt.</p><p>The black demonic Qi which represented ultimate yin, evil, and darkness began to churn.</p><p>With just a spark, it devoured and attacked the divine power! “Pshht!”</p><p>On the ground, the first Reborn Lily that bloomed was dyed black under the demonic Qi attack.</p><p>After that…</p><p>It was the second flower, the third flower…</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was the nearest and the first to be attacked by the demonic Qi.</p><p>His eyes turned red again, but his head kept shaking. He seemed to have realized something and stretched out his hand to stop what would probably happen next.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
