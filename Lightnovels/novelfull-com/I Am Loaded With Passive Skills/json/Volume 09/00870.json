As this fellow dared to speak to him in such a manner, it was obvious that they had known each other before.</p><p>However…</p><p>“Have we met before?”Yi raised his eyebrows curiously.</p><p>Patriarch Wuji laughed and his expression suddenly turned cold.</p><p>“In the past, Dao Qiongcang personally captured me. In terms of the Divine Secret technique, my skills are inferior to others. I admit it.</p><p>“But even though he couldn’t find anything from his interrogation, why did he throw me into your trash six divisions?</p><p>“D*mn it, if my ability isn’t up to par, and you can’t find anything from interrogating me… then you torture me, right?” Patriarch Wuji approached him aggressively and asked, “The weapon prohibition order is very useful, isn’t it? It makes you, a mere Great Void, dare to destroy my physical body directly?!”</p><p>Hearing this, Yi’s pupils suddenly constricted.</p><p>He remembered now!</p><p>This person…</p><p>“Xuan Wuji?” Yi’s face was full of disbelief.</p><p>“Hahaha…” Patriarch Wuji raised his head and laughed loudly. “You recognize me now? Very good, now that my physical body has collapsed and the weapon prohibition order is ineffective, I’d like to see if you, a mere Great Void, still have the guts to jump in front of</p><p>me!”</p><p>Yi Xin was shocked.</p><p>How could such a character suddenly appear?</p><p>Xuan Wuji…</p><p>Wasn’t this fellow already locked up on Abyss Island?</p><p>Something was not right!</p><p>Yi suddenly recalled that a ghost beast had escaped from Abyss Island a few months ago. It was suspected that it had mastered the Divine Secret technique…</p><p>It was him?</p><p>It was Patriarch Wuji who had escaped?!</p><p>Yi was panicked.</p><p>He didn’t expect the little guard by Mu Zixi’s side to be the real hidden boss.</p><p>Ghost beast host body?</p><p>Young Master Xu had Mu Zixi by his side and even a ghost beast that had escaped from Abyss Island. Then the question was…</p><p>Who was he?</p><p>All sorts of things and clues from the past were frantically interweaving in his mind at this moment, and the mystery seemed to be about to be solved.</p><p>But it was just a little bit more…</p><p>Just a little bit more!</p><p>At the critical moment, Yi’s ears once again exploded with Mu Zixi’s dying roar…</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>This was the truth?</p><p>Yi’s eyeballs were about to pop out of their sockets, filled with disbelief.</p><p>So, the First Pavilion in the Sky, the organization that stood proudly in the Dongtianwang City for so long, was… real? The speculations of Rao Yaoyao, Ye Xiao, and the others, as well as the speculations that were denied by the red-clothed night guardian in the past, were also true?</p><p>“Have you figured it out now?”</p><p>Seeing the shocked expression on the person in front of him, Patriarch Wuji knew that the other party should have figured it out by now.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Yi swallowed a mouthful of saliva, and his heart began to beat faster.</p><p>“By calling the holy name directly, Hall Master Dao must have sensed the boundary of this place by now!” Yi appeared tough from the outside but was actually timid deep down in his heart.</p><p>“I dare to call him by his bullsh*t name Dao Qiongcang. Do you think the news here can still spread?</p><p>Patriarch Wuji laughed. “I’ve waited for so long to lay down this heavenly secret. Even if a Demi-Saint came, he wouldn’t be able to find out what happened here!</p><p>“In other words…”</p><p>Patriarch Wuji pointed at Yi in front of him with a cold expression and muttered, “Tonight, even if the gods came, they wouldn’t be able to save you!”</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>A sound behind them broke the deadlock.</p><p>The two of them looked at each other at the same time. They saw that Mu Zixi couldn’t hold on any longer and finally fell to the ground.</p><p>Wisps of black fog appeared on her body. Even so, her eyes were still staring at the empty night sky.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>No sound was heard.</p><p>However, the two of them knew from the movements of her lips that Mu Zixi was still calling out the same name at her last moment.</p><p>Similarly.</p><p>It was just like how everyone thought that Mu Zixi was still engaging in a meaningless struggle until the very end.</p><p>No one knew that in the eyes of this little girl who had collapsed on the ground, the night sky was not just nothingness.</p><p>The God Devil Eyes was able to break through the illusion.</p><p>The power of its divinity seemed to have been pushed to the limit when Mu Zixi was exhausted at the very last moment.</p><p>In her eyes.</p><p>A clear figure had appeared in the desolation above the Nine Heavens.</p><p>It was the figure of a young man who had disappeared. His entire body was emitting the holy light and his temperament was extraordinary. Even his appearance seemed to have undergone plastic surgery, becoming extremely outstanding.</p><p>He raised his sword and was stunned.</p><p>He seemed to be in disbelief at this irreparable scene.</p><p>After the disbelief, his eyes turned scarlet as he roared hysterically.</p><p>“Fool…”</p><p>Mu Zixi laughed.</p><p>She laughed at Xu Xioashou who was indeed a fool. Didn’t this fellow know that he couldn’t even make a sound when he disappeared?</p><p>“He didn’t even let me know what he shouted at the end…”</p><p>Mu Zixi closed her eyes with a smile and allowed her soul to fall into the endless darkness once again. Light and shadows flashed through her memory as it kept replaying. Finally, it stopped at the scene of the first time the two of them met.</p><p>It was at the Tiansang Spirit Palace, in the battle for hegemony…</p><p>At that time, she had used the ancient wood to push away a person whose name she had forgotten, and Xu Xiaoshou had quarreled with him.</p><p>The two of them had even fought. In the end, Xu Xiaoshou let that fellow sniff at the elixirs…</p><p>It was really funny!</p><p>The other party had suffered such a serious injury, yet he didn’t give him any elixir but just let him sniff…</p><p>He was very stupid!</p><p>Due to the tight schedule of the competition, she had no choice but to call for help. In the end, she told Xu Xiaojie a lot of things, but this fellow was so stupid that he couldn’t hear a single word…</p><p>Her memories were fragmented, and it was difficult for her to recall anything again.</p><p>Darkness engulfed everything.</p><p>Everything in the mortal world seemed to have nothing to do with her anymore.</p><p>Mu Zixi was tired.</p><p>She really couldn’t think of anything else.</p><p>At the last moment when her soul entered the endpoint of darkness, it was as if the replay of her life before her death was also forced to be frozen.</p><p>Mu Zixi was slightly stunned when she saw the final scene from her memory.</p><p>She suddenly felt that the experience in this world was so ironic…</p><p>As she recalled toward the end, the scene that was frozen in her mind was only the first sentence that Xu Xiaojiu had spoken to her after he squatted down and turned his head.</p><p>The wheel of fate seemed to be forever controlled by someone.</p><p>That first sentence sounded like the first sentence now, but it was more like the last sentence…</p><p>“Hi bye!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
