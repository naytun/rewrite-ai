He finally understood what Dong Ling’s goal was.</p><p>So she wanted to use him?</p><p>Great!</p><p>If you dare to use me, then I’m not afraid of deepening the relationship with your Magic Pill Technicians Association. Now that I’m giving you some benefits, I’ll see how you can extricate yourself then!</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou replied as he looked at the tens of thousands of spectators. Then, he shouted to the crowd, “I am willing to accept President Dong Ling’s invitation to join the headquarters of the Magic Pill Technicians Association in Dongtianwang City.”</p><p>He paused for a moment, a smile appeared on his face. “In return, after today, I will grant the exclusive right to supply Amber Juice to the headquarters of the Magic Pill Technicians Association of the imperial city. This is to refine more and better healing medicine for the benefit of everyone!”</p><p>As soon as he said this, the entire place fell silent.</p><p>Just a moment ago, everyone was still thinking that it was too unrealistic for Young Master Xu to obtain the position of honorary vice-president.</p><p>‘That was because they had witnessed a young man of the same generation, or even a younger generation, suddenly leap to a level that was much higher than them. They could not help but feel a little sour.</p><p>However, after they were done feeling envious, they found out that Young Master Xu becoming the honorary vice-president of the Imperial City’s Alchemy Association could bring them benefits.</p><p>This time, all the spiritual cultivators present changed their words.</p><p>“alright!”</p><p>“Young Master Xu is mighty. I’ll be the first to support you as the honorary vice-president. Go for it!”</p><p>“A new official is appointed to serve the people. I’ve tried the Amber Juice and it’s extremely effective. The people of the imperial city will be blessed this time. Hahaha.”</p><p>Even Dong Ling was stunned.</p><p>Just as Shi Ti had thought, she did not hesitate to incur the wrath of the public in order to give the honorary vice-president position to Young Master Xu. It was because she had seen through something and had the intention to probe and protect him.</p><p>However, she had never thought that Young Master Xu would give such a huge benefit before he actually took up the position.</p><p>“are you serious?” After Dong Ling recovered from her shock, she looked at the young man beside her with some difficulty and excitement.</p><p>“My words are as heavy as Mount Tai.” The corner of Xu Xiaoshou’s lips lifted.</p><p>Dong Ling’s beautiful eyes immediately lit up. She suddenly raised her hand and wanted to pat Young Master Xu’s shoulder to express her excitement and say a few tactful words of thanks.</p><p>However, before she could pat him, Young Master Xu had cleverly avoided her. For a moment, she swayed her hand in embarrassment.</p><p>“Don’t worry. If you can give the exclusive rights of the Amber Juice to the Imperial City’s headquarters, you won’t lose a portion of the profits from it in the future.” Dong Ling quickly cleaned up her embarrassment and promised solemnly.</p><p>“It’s a little strange to say this…” Xu Xiaoshou raised his brows and looked back again and again, he said in a low voice, “Actually, it’s not just Amber Juice. I have also developed Spirit Cultivation Juice. I just don’t know if you guys can eat it.”</p><p>“Spirit Cultivation Juice?”</p><p>“Yes, Amber Juice is comparable to the Red Gold Pill, and Spirit Cultivation Juice to the Spiritual Cultivation Pill.”</p><p>Upon hearing that, Dong Ling immediately understood and was ecstatic.</p><p>However, her keen sense of awareness, which had been cultivated over the years, made her realize that how could such a good thing fall from the sky onto her in broad daylight?</p><p>“What do you want?” Dong Ling frowned.</p><p>“Want?” Xu Xiaoshou seemed to be shocked, he laughed and said, “Am I not the honorary vice-president of the Imperial City’s Alchemy Association? Aren’t we on the same side? What do I want? The only thing I want is to benefit the entire human race and the people of the five regions!”</p><p>Dong Ling was speechless.</p><p>If someone else said this, she would believe it.</p><p>But the person standing in front of her was Young Master Xu. How could Dong Ling dare to believe it?</p><p>Has this guy gone crazy?</p><p>Dong Ling was suspicious.</p><p>She had her own reasons for protecting Young Master Xu. Young Master Xu should not have known about her relationship with the infernal lineage of the Holy Palace.</p><p>But this guy was so good to her. What could be his reason?</p><p>His lust for beauty?</p><p>Dong Ling gave herself a fright.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw that the woman in front of him did not believe him, so he pondered for a moment before saying seriously, “The kindness of a drop of water is repaid by a gushing spring. President Dong Ling can bear the blame for giving me the position of honorary vice-president. Why can’t I turn this</p><p>blame on you into a good reputation?”</p><p>These words were too sincere, and Dong Ling was moved.</p><p>She suddenly felt that her previous impression of Young Master Xu might be wrong.</p><p>Perhaps, this person in front of her was not just a dandy, in his heart, he was also capable of clearly distinguishing right from wrong.</p><p>Whoever treated him well, he would remember them in his heart.</p><p>“If that’s the case, then I’ll first thank Young Master Xu on behalf of the imperial city’s spiritual cultivators.” Dong Ling also became serious.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression changed, and he flung his sleeves. “It’s president Xu!”</p><p>Dong Ling was stunned, and she also laughed. “Yes, it’s indeed time to change my greeting, president Xu.”</p><p>At this moment, the information bar had already changed from “Suspected” to “Appreciated.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that his sincere words had moved President Dong Ling.</p><p>He also knew that this woman had fallen into his trap.</p><p>From now on, the exclusive rights to supply Amber Juice would no longer belong to Greedy the Cat Spirit, but to all the big shots of the Magic Pill Technicians Association.</p><p>As for the exclusive resale rights, he had previously signed a contract with Plenty Gold Company, so the market in the future would be very big.</p><p>This wave of resale was equivalent to him, Xu Xiaoshou, selling only one set of Amber Juice and Spirit Cultivation Juice formula.</p><p>However, he didn’t sell them all at a low price. Instead, he only sold one set of formulas. After that, he changed from a laborer to a shareholder and began to take the Magic Pill Technicians Association’s dividends.</p><p>From now on, Xu Xiaoshou and Greedy the Cat Spirit would no longer have to work.</p><p>Plenty Gold Company’s spiritual medicine would be transported to him as usual. He could choose to give a portion of it away, or he could choose to hoard it all.</p><p>On the side of the association, under the pretext of training the alchemists, he would use the association’s spiritual medicine to refine Amber Juice and so on. Then, he would let Plenty Gold Company sell the finished product.</p><p>The money they sold would be divided into one portion for the association, one portion for Plenty Gold Company, and the rest…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t lose anything, but he would reap the most benefits.</p><p>One sentence states, “If you don’t know how to lead a team. You can only work until you die.”</p><p>The cooperation was achieved.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that he had completed the capital liberation in an instant, and he would be a free man from now on.</p><p>As long as the headquarters of the Imperial City’s Magic Pill Technicians Association did not collapse and Plenty Gold Company did not close down, there would be an endless stream of spirit crystal coming into his account.</p><p>Not only that…</p><p>“Received gratitude, passive points + 1.”</p><p>Dong Ling’s emotional transformation kept bouncing on the information bar.</p><p>This woman even looked back and sized up Xu Xiaoshou from time to time. She could not understand why such a good person existed in this world.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled.</p><p>Not only did he have financial freedom and the freedom to work, but he also received friendship from the Alchemy Association of the Imperial City.</p><p>If anything happened to him in the future, the first person who would help Xu Xiaoshou with his life would definitely be Dong Ling.</p><p>After all, for every portion of Amber Juice that was produced, Dong Ling, the big boss of the Alchemy Association, would definitely make a profit.</p><p>“With the exchange of benefits, everyone is happy. This is really dirty…” Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but sigh.</p><p>At the judge’s seat.</p><p>The dozen or so old presidents couldn’t hold it in anymore and were trying to attack the protective spiritual array.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, not only was the position of the honorary vice president gone, even the right to supply Amber Juice was gone. Young Master Xu had also pulled out a spirit cultivation juice…</p><p>“shameless, Dong Ling, you’re too shameless!”</p><p>“Using a spiritual array to trap more than ten old men like us, do you have any shame?”</p><p>“After today, this old man will definitely report you to the headquarters of the Central Region’s Association for alchemy. I will list out your crimes one by one.”</p><p>“amber Juice, Red Gold Pill, those are the interests of this old man, Tian Yuan City. If you try to snatch food from the tiger’s mouth, you will definitely be punished by the heavens!”</p><p>“Damn it –”</p><p>From the perspective of the audience.</p><p>‘The old judge sat back in his seat calmly. Each of them had a smile on their faces, and they were as calm as the clouds.</p><p>“The Magic Pill Technicians Association is really harmonious. It’s unlike our faction, where there are all sorts of conflicts between the various peaks for the sake of benefits, both overtly and covertly. There are even people who are willing to kill each other.”</p><p>“That’s right. Previously, I thought that President Lu wanted to cooperate with Young Master Xu for Amber Juice. I didn’t expect that President Dong Ling would take over this partnership right. He’s acting so indifferent. They should have already discussed this beforehand.”</p><p>“Experts are all experts.”</p><p>“Our generation can’t match up to him. I’m amazed.”</p><p>The curtain fell on the alchemy conference.</p><p>‘The matter came to an end. Xu Xiaoshou returned to the First Pavilion in the Sky with the title of champion, the grade four badge, the Little Blue Flower of the Tranquil Lake, and the Imperial City Trial’s jade pendant that he had always dreamed of.</p><p>On the way back, the various factions that hadn’t been in contact with each other previously popped up like mushrooms after a rain.</p><p>What they wanted to talk about was nothing more than cooperation and a win-win situation.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rejected them one by one.</p><p>What a joke!</p><p>Cooperating with these local factions of Dongtianwang city would at most extend to the entire land realm of the Imperial City. Then, they would harvest a small portion of the leek.</p><p>However, cooperating with the Plenty Gold Company and the Magic Pill Technicians Association would affect the entire five regions.</p><p>It was easy to guess who was more important.</p><p>Thus, no matter how tempting the conditions offered by the various factions were, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even meet with them. He only instructed Xiao Wanfeng to reply with words of appreciation for the offers.</p><p>However, there was one person who stayed behind.</p><p>There was no other reason. That violent girl carried a large bathtub and almost tore down the signboard of the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>Not to mention Xiao Wanfeng, even Xin Gugu couldn’t take it.</p><p>“Miss Hua, what are you trying to do?”</p><p>According to the request, everyone was sent away. In the hall of the First Pavilion in the Sky, only Xu Xiaoshou and Hua Ying were left. Xu Xiaoshou went straight to the point.</p><p>Hua Ying carried the large bathtub and did not even have the intention to put it away. She looked as if she would fight if he did not agree to see her.</p><p>She pushed the large bathtub on her back. “Do you know this thing?”</p><p>“Lknow it!” Xu Xiaoshou nodded. “It’s an alchemy cauldron. It’s a larger alchemy cauldron. In short, it can’t be a bathtub, right?”</p><p>Act, you can continue keeping that act… Hua Ying laughed coldly. “During the Alchemy Convention, why didn’t you dare to display your alchemy technique and even use those black chickens to divert everyone’s attention?”</p><p>“Black Chickens?” When Xu Xiaoshou heard the echo in the spacious hall, he smiled and spread his hands. “What Black Chickens? That’s my alchemy technique. Miss Hua, by saying that, aren’t you insulting my Xu Clan’s alchemy technique?”</p><p>“Xu Clan?” Hua Ying was extremely angry. “So your last condensing method is also the alchemy of the Xu Clan?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows and directly opened the eight trigrams pilgrimage map, isolating the people on the second floor, including Xiao Wanfeng, from watching. His expression became solemn.</p><p>“Miss Hua…”</p><p>“Don’t call me Miss Hua!”</p><p>Hua Ying interrupted. She always felt that the way Young Master Xu addressed her was a little disrespectful.</p><p>However, she couldn’t tell where the disrespect was coming from. She just felt that the other party was teasing her.</p><p>“Alright, Miss Xiao Hua…”</p><p>“Call me Hua Ying!”</p><p>“We’re not that close…” Xu Xiaoshou was halfway through his words when he glared back at the violent woman. He smiled bitterly and said, “Alright, Miss Hua Ying, what exactly do you want?”</p><p>Hua Ying was not good at alchemy, but her cultivation level was not weak. How could she not sense the fluctuations of the spiritual array around her?</p><p>After knowing that no one was watching, she also became bold.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“Oh?” Xu Xiaoshou was stunned as if he was frightened. “Miss Hua, you don’t need to address me like this. I am the official member of the Taixiang Xu family of the Northern Regio!</p><p>“Master ‘s brother, Uncle Xu!” Hua Ying interrupted.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou choked.</p><p>Master’s brother…</p><p>This address…</p><p>“Why don’t you want to acknowledge me?” Hua Ying was very sad. She couldn’t understand why.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart rippled, but his face remained calm. “Miss Hua Ying, I am really curious. Why do you always treat me as your martial uncle Xu? Is it because of my surname? Are you sure you didn’t find the wrong person?”</p><p>“I didn’t find the wrong person…”</p><p>Hua Ying shook her head firmly and explained, “Other people can’t see through the condensing method of Infernal Heavens, but I, the descendant of Infernal Heavens, can see through</p><p>“You are clearly my master Bai Lian’s senior brother, the disciple of my Grandmaster Mu Lin’s senior brother Sang Qiye. Do you really think I’m stupid and can’t see through anything?” Hua Ying felt that her intelligence had been insulted.</p><p>She was just not good at alchemy, but it didn’t mean that her intelligence was also problematic.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou heard this, he also felt that something was wrong.</p><p>This girl had come to recognize her relative the last time.</p><p>After witnessing the condensing method of Infernal Heavens this time, she became even crazier.</p><p>But she didn’t look like she was here to interrogate him…</p><p>It didn’t seem like she was an enemy either…</p><p>At least after interacting with her for a while, this girl didn’t display the abilities of the truly intelligent people that Xu Xiaoshou had come into contact with in the past — scheming.</p><p>Clearly, she was not as intelligent as she appeared to be. She was truly foolish.</p><p>Then, there were some things that could be said clearly.</p><p>“Let me put it this way. Although I’m not that so-called martial uncle Xu that you mentioned, I don’t mind hearing about it. Why do you think that I’m your master’s brother, uncle Xu?” Xu Xiaoshou took a step back in order to advance.</p><p>The little lady’s brain was clearly not very good, and she was able to get the words out in an instant.</p><p>She took out a letter.</p><p>“This letter was given to me by my master, Bai Lian. The mission he gave me was to go down the mountain to find the descendant of Grandmaster Sang’s lineage, which is you, Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“Thave also inquired about the letter’s decree during my time down the mountain. Saint servant, Sang Qiye, who is also Grandmaster Sang, has been arrested by the Holy Divine Palace. He left you alone to wander around.”</p><p>“Tm not stupid. How could I not know that the letter didn’t mean my master, but my grandmaster Mu Lin, or even demi-saint infernal?”</p><p>“His disciple Sang Qiye betrayed the Holy Palace a long time ago.”</p><p>“But you’re not. There’s nothing on the surface that points to you being Sang Qiye’s disciple. You’re just a wandering descendant of infernal. You just haven’t returned to the Holy Palace.”</p><p>“Great Grandmaster wants you to go home. Once you’re home, you’ll be safe. But why won’t you acknowledge me? Why won’t you go home?!”</p><p>Hua Ying became anxious as she spoke.</p><p>‘What she couldn’t understand the most was that with the agreement of her master brother, Uncle Xu, the Holy Palace could protect him. There were too many excuses in between.</p><p>But he just kept refusing. What was his intention?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fell silent after listening to her.</p><p>He finally understood Hua Ying’s real intention.</p><p>So, the words “Your next backer, Long Rongzhi” that Elder Sang said before blocking the arrow in the eighth palace actually meant this?</p><p>“Can I take a look at this letter?” Xu Xiaoshou looked at the envelope with a serious expression.</p><p>Hua Ying stopped her hand at lightning speed and said with a doubtful expression, “No, you can only read it if you are certain that you are my martial uncle Xu.”</p><p>Silly girl, why do you still think you’re not stupid after coming all the way here… Xu Xiaoshou was going crazy.</p><p>This is the descendant of the infernal lineage?</p><p>Her brain must have been fried by the Infernal White Flame!</p><p>If you really found the wrong person, then wouldn’t you be playing a game of confession with a stranger? Or would you be able to collect the greatest evidence of the Holy Palace protecting the members of the dark faction with just a nod of the stranger’s head?</p><p>“It’s a good thing you found the right person…” Xu Xiaoshou cursed in his heart.</p><p>He really didn’t know whether Hua Ying was a fool who had dumb luck or something else.</p><p>She was so naive that she could actually deceive the main character.</p><p>But…</p><p>Should he read this letter or not? Should he accept it or not?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
