These people are all suffocating. Now that the origin stone has appeared, they don’t even suppress their cultivation realms anymore.” “Yes, in just half a day, we have seen no less than 200 Master (stage) cultivators. Who knows how many more people have broken through in other places?” “Let’s look for the cloud beads. Such a treasure isn’t something we can get our hands on. Let alone if we can get it or not and if we really get it, who will be able to keep it?”</p><p>“That’s true…”</p><p>There was envy in the eyes of the cultivators below, but they knew that not everyone could afford to play with the origin stone. Taking advantage of the appearance of the origin stone which had attracted the higher-level combat strength, they would have a lot of time and space to accumulate the points. In the void. With the speed of the Peak of Master, Xu Xiaoshou and the other two were sprinting at full speed. In just half a day, they had reached the inner area. Indeed, putting aside the task of accumulating points and focusing on the journey, it was estimated that it would take a day or so to cross the Yunlun Mountain Range which spanned tens of thousands of miles.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, we’re almost there.” Liu Changqing was hurrying along as he checked the trial map. The three of them had been extremely fast, but somehow the distance was long. At this moment, the fire-type origin stone’s coordinates began to move. “It’s moving again.”</p><p>Xin Gugu was also staring at the trial map, but he said with a smile, “But we can only see the coordinates moving after zooming in. It’s probably because people are fighting over it, but they’re all fighting in the same place. The origin stones are constantly changing owners.”</p><p>Hearing this, Xu Xiaoshou instantly knew what was going on. At this moment, not a single expert had rushed over to the coordinates of the fire-type origin stone.</p><p>Otherwise, the coordinates of the origin stone would start moving at a high speed.</p><p>“Hurry up. As long as we can get there first, no one can snatch the origin stone away from me!” Xu Xiaoshou said resolutely. He was afraid that if he arrived too late, the origin stone would fall into the hands of some people who were not easy to deal with. For example, the people of Saint Servant, the stowaway, the other Demi-Saint descendant, and so on.</p><p>It was hard to say if a battle would break out at that time.</p><p>What he was afraid of was that it was not easy to get the thing, and the process would become troublesome. However, as long as he was the first who seized the opportunity, with his identity and strength, he would not be afraid even if he met the stowaway. The three people rushed forward at full speed. Suddenly, a faint sound of something landing was heard in the distance.</p><p>A great sense of threat assaulted them, and the three of them stopped in their tracks at the same time. They stopped in mid-air and turned their gazes over. “Who is it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was astonished.</p><p>There was someone in the Yunlun Mountain Range who could give him a feeling of fear. A stowaway?</p><p>When he looked closely, the person who came was not a stowaway, but a black-clothed trial officer whom he had seen from afar a day ago.</p><p>Black clothes, it was the same standard black clothes.</p><p>However, the person was not the same person he saw a day ago Others might be unfamiliar with this face. But when Xu Xiaoshou saw this face, he was instantly horrified.</p><p>“Yu Lingdi?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>Wasn’t this young face the face of Yu Lingdi, the Spirit Division Chief who had tortured him to death in the Eighth Palace and was killed by Elder Sang? “Why is he here?” “He’s not dead yet?” “He’s actually not dead!” Lightning struck in Xu Xiaoshou’s mind. Countless memory fragments were now connected, tying up everything that had happened recently. The peeping Tom in the night rain in the Imperial City The hidden black hand, the last pursuer of the major factions… And Cutting Path (stage)!</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could tell at a glance. If Yu Lingdi wasn’t dead, then there was only one possibility. After Elder Sang isolated him from the Way of the Heavens, the element, and other random methods of resurrection, the only way he could survive was to make a breakthrough at the last minute. “Destroy and then establish, reborn in blood?” Xu Xiaoshou felt his scalp go numb. How terrifying was this! Elder Sang of the Higher Void (level) had killed a young Sovereign using such a method, but he still couldn’t be completely killed and even resurrected? Was the final stage of the Dao realm this terrifying? But the main thing was that back in the Eighth Palace, Yu Lingdi had been destroyed both in body and soul, and even Gou Wuyue was furious about it. How did he resurrect? What did he use to resurrect? There was a backup plan that he had left thousands of miles away? Xu Xiaoshou’s hair stood on end. There were indeed all kinds of wonders in the greater world. Although he had been crushed to pieces, this Spirit Division Chief could still change his way of life and start all over again? “The three of you.” Yu Lingdi stepped forward, his body filled with path energy. This time, he had lost the arrogance that he had when they first met in the Eighth Palace. His temperament was much calmer now. He only smiled and said, “I have been waiting for you here for a long time.”</p><p>“Who are you?” Even though Xu Xiaoshou knew who the person was, the shock, surprise, and strangeness he displayed were so natural.</p><p>“You can call me the trial officer,” Yu Lingdi nodded slightly at Xu Xiaoshou and said, “But this time, it has nothing to do with the two of you. I’m only here for him.” As he said this, he pointed at Liu Changqing. Liu Changqing’s heart skipped a beat. He closed his eyes and covered his trembling pupils.</p><p>He was a ghost beast host body, so he knew that the trial officer’s essence was red-clothed and white-clothed. It was obvious why the person in front of him was there. However, the other party did not say anything, so he did not have to confess. Just as he was about to speak, Xu Xiaoshou took a step forward and stopped him. “Trial officer?”</p><p>“I’ve actually met the trial official, but the person you’re looking for seems to be a stowaway. What does it have to do with my companion?” Xu Xiaoshou was calm and collected.</p><p>Seeing that Young Master Xu was the leader among the three of them, Yu Lingdi knew that he would not be able to get anyone if he didn’t pass through Young Master Xu. He immediately said, “Young Master Xu has mentioned my intention. Why do you need me to say it again?” “Pshht!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou snorted. “I have seen you trial officers randomly capture and kill people. If it doesn’t happen to me, I can’t be bothered! However, if you’re accusing without any evidence, and you want to take someone away from me…”</p><p>He pulled out Hidden Bitter with a clang and pointed the tip of his sword and sneered, “My Demi-Saint family rules will not allow this to happen.”</p><p>His aura rose to the sky and pushed away the heavy pressure of the trial officer. Xu Xiaoshou not only revealed his identity as the descendant of Demi-Saint but also revealed Demi-Saint Xu family’s nature of protecting their offspring. He did not believe that Yu Lingdi would dare to offend Demi-Saint faction for no reason.</p><p>Yu Lingdi naturally did not care about these things, but he was surprised that Young Master Xu’s aura was so strong that it could rival his.</p><p>“You want evidence?” he tilted his head. “Without evidence, does this mean that you can simply capture anyone you want to capture in the Yunlun Mountain Range? And kill anyone if you want them to die?” Xu Xiaoshou’s expression was cold. Yu Lingdi smiled. He didn’t care about his identity as a Demi-Saint descendant. However, he valued Young Master Xu’s intention of protecting his talented people. Thus he control his temper and explained, “You must have misunderstood. If you want, I can show the evidence for everyone the trial officers have captured…” Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand and interrupted, “In that case, show me!” Yu Lingdi raised his eyebrows. He was a little displeased that he had been interrupted. However, he immediately nodded his head, pointed at Liu Changqing, and went straight to the point. “He has mastered the Divine Secret technique and his level is not low. Coincidentally, a ghost beast came out from Sky City a few months ago. It also knows the Divine Secret technique and is very powerful. The methods used by the two of them are very similar. Is this considered evidence?”</p><p>Yu Lingdi did not hide anything from the Demi-Saint descendant.</p><p>The ghost beast was a secret to the world, but the practitioners of the Demi-Saint family basically understood it very well.</p><p>After all, the people in the family were also afraid that the younger generation of the family did not know anything about the ghost beast. When they went around, what if they clashed with the ghost beast? Liu Changqing listened from the side and his heart sank to the bottom of the valley.</p><p>He had never thought that red-clothed people’s sense of smell was so sharp.</p><p>So Sharp that he could identify the person with just a suspicion. At that moment, his hands and feet became cold, and despair grew in the depths of his heart.</p><p>Xin Gugu was the same.</p><p>He was also a ghost beast host body. The only fortunate thing was that he had hidden deep enough that the red-clothed people’s target was not him.</p><p>Both of them looked at Xu Xiaoshou at the same time.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment when he heard this. But then, he reacted and laughed. “That’s it?” he teased.</p><p>“Isn’t that enough?” Yu Lingdi frowned. “It’s just a suspicion. It’s enough for what? It’s enough for the red-clothed people to capture people directly from my Demi-Saint faction?” Xu Xiaoshou asked. He paused and then widened his eyes. He laughed and said, “Do you trial officers think that the Demi-Saint Xu Clan is like ordinary people? And you can capture them as you please. If you have any doubts, you can send them to be interrogated. If you don’t have any doubts, you can throw them back like a toy, Huh?!” He almost roared out the last word. Xin Gugu and Liu Changqing were both shocked.</p><p>The two of them had never expected Young Master Xu to be so tough.</p><p>He was so tough that even Xin Gugu thought that Xu Xiaoshou was really a Demi-Saint descendant. He really had a colossus behind him that could rival the Holy Divine Palace. It was supporting him to say such words that offended red-clothed people. It looked so real! It was like real!</p><p>Yu Lingdi was choked. He did not expect Young Master Xu to be able to withstand pressure so well. The aura of the Cutting Path (stage) could suppress the Sovereign of the Innate (stage) level. However, it was useless against Young Master Xu.</p><p>Not only was Young Master Xu not afraid, but he could also even calmly face the trial officer. From his words to his actions, they were truly equal. Yu Lingdi’s eyes were filled with admiration. Such a young man was too rare. He was indeed worthy of being someone that even Sword Deity Rao was tempted to bring into the Holy Divine Palace. He believed that any other Demi-Saint descendant might not be able to achieve the same level as Young Master Xu. Yet, what Young Master Xu said was true!</p><p>Red-clothed and white-clothed people could take anyone they wanted. As long as there was suspicion, they could capture and interrogate them.</p><p>However, this was an unspoken rule. Not to mention the Demi-Saint faction, even the Higher Void family would not allow such a thing to happen. It would be fine if they did not capture the wrong person. But if they did, the consequences would be huge. After all, even if the person didn’t die in the Red Coat Prison, he would at least suffer an injury! “You are quite interesting.” Yu Lingdi smiled.</p><p>He had promised Sword Deity Rao that this was an easy mission because he had observed Young Master Xu before.</p><p>However, he had never thought that the Young Master Xu he had seen before was all a disguise.</p><p>Deep down, this fellow was an extremely intelligent and calm person.</p><p>He possessed all the qualities that a Demi-Saint successor should possess. He was believed to be one of the top geniuses even in his clan!</p><p>However…</p><p>If it was another trial officer, he might be stunned.</p><p>Just like the night guardian, he would be stunned by the identity of ‘Young Master Xu’. However, Yu Lingdi would not!</p><p>Who was he?</p><p>He was neither red-clothed nor white-clothed.</p><p>He belonged to the six divisions of the Holy Divine Palace, which were equal in status to the red-clothed and white-clothed people. Furthermore, he was the Spirit Division Chief of the six divisions and not an ordinary citizen.</p><p>To put it another way.</p><p>From a certain perspective, other than the top leader of red-clothed people and one with ‘status as one of the two rulers of the Way’, Yu Lingdi was equal in status with Rao Yaoyao!</p><p>Yu Lingdi was not sent here as a subordinate on this mission of Dongtianwang City. He was here to assist and help. He was not a night guardian.</p><p>Although he was young, his name was Yu Lingdi.</p><p>In Dongtianwang City, he was second to none. With such a status, what was he afraid of? “What if I don’t care and insist on having this guardian by your side?” Yu Lingdi’s expression was solemn. He had regained the arrogance that a younger generation should have when they held such a high position in the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>Xin Gugu and Liu Changqing’s hearts trembled.</p><p>The two of them could feel that the moment the young trial officer’s shifted his gaze, all the elements in the world disappeared and were replaced by the water element.</p><p>There was no bounded domain here.</p><p>But the entire Yunlun Mountain Range had become the young trial officer’s bounded domain under heavy pressure.</p><p>In this domain.</p><p>It was all up to him.</p><p>Whoever he wanted to kill had to die.</p><p>Regardless if it was the Sovereign (stage) Xin Gugu or the Cutting Path (stage) Liu Changqing! “So powerful…”</p><p>Xin Gugu and Liu Changqing looked at each other and saw the shock in each other’s eyes.</p><p>In their lives, the strongest expert among the younger generation was probably Young Master Xu. And now, this young man had the power of Cutting Path (stage), and not just any Cutting Path (stage), but the Peak of Cutting Path (stage) that Liu Changqing could not even withstand!</p><p>Under the terrifying suppression. Xu Xiaoshou did not even flinch. He said indifferently, “You can try.” “Oh?” Yu Lingdi chuckled and took a step forward.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The area within a radius of 10 miles suddenly split open. The void rippled as if it couldn’t withstand the destructive aura and collapsed.</p><p>“Ptui…”</p><p>Xin Gugu spat out a mouthful of blood and retreated. He was now displaying the cultivation level of an Innate (stage). Before he died, his disguise wasn’t sloppy at all.</p><p>“Wu!”</p><p>Liu Changqing’s face was also flushed red. His cheeks puffed up, but he stubbornly swallowed the blood into his stomach.</p><p>Everyone was smart, and they also did not forget that when a Master (stage) faced the Peak of Cutting Path, one would be as weak as not able to withstand even the aura!</p><p>There was nothing wrong with the two’s performance.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou, who was the first to bear the brunt of the pressure, did not retreat even half a step! He even raised the Hidden Bitter in his hand and clenched it tightly. He squeezed out a light smile, “Among the younger generation, I have not been afraid of anything. I will never retreat even half a step, even if you are at the Cutting Path (stage)!”</p><p>“Even if I am the Spirit Division Chief, even if my name is Yu Lingdi?” Yu Lingdi’s gaze was mocking as he took another step forward.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The space was completely shattered.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s body swayed slightly, but he was still able to persevere. He was surprised at how the younger generation could cultivate to such a level. At the same time, he also knew that the difference between him and the other party was merely the amount of time they spent on cultivating. Yet, he wanted to suppress himself with just his aura…</p><p>What was ‘Swallow the Mountains and Rivers’?</p><p>Facing such pressure, Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he had returned to the fantasy realm when he faced that giant. Among his peers, a person who had once brought him the burden of death, and a person who could now bring him the pressure of an aura, not only did he not suppress him, he even ignited the raging flames of war in his eyes. Xu Xiaoshou held Hidden Bitter in his hand.</p><p>Hidden Bitter did not know what fear was at all. It hummed and trembled, and the Sword Will overflowed into the sky, continuously attacking this overwhelming pressure. Xu Xiaoshou’s heroic spirit rose in his chest. He knew that Yu Lingdi would never be able to suppress him with just his aura. He lifted his chin and looked at Yu Lingdi with disdain. His arrogance soared to the sky as he resolutely shouted, “Let’s not talk about who you, Yu Lingdi, are. Today, even if time and space are in disorder and the Bazhun’an of the younger generation have come to understand, they can not make me take half a step back! “You want to take him? Fine.” Xu Xiaoshou sneered, changed the topic, and drew his sword, “If you have the guts, then charge through my sword!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
