(Part 3)</p><p>In the City Lord Mansion of Tiansang City, Xu Xiaoshou could still use the Master (stage) Weaving Expertise to solve the powerful Thirty-Six Heavens Sealed Array.</p><p>The Sovereign (stage) Weaving Expertise covered almost everything in the Divine Secret.</p><p>In just a while, Xu Xiaoshou had comprehended all the subtleties of the Spirit Shifting Six Profound Formation.</p><p>He had even found 12 flaws in it.</p><p>However, at this moment, he did not want to go into detail and perfect it, nor did he have a way to perfect it.</p><p>Although it was a lousy formation, it was enough for use.</p><p>Seeing that the bewilderment in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes had been cleared, Patriarch Wuji knew in his heart that this fellow had given up.</p><p>However, he did not dare to say it out for fear of losing the Young Man’s face. He could only say, “I can help you control Yi’s soul body. As for you… Well, no matter what the outcome is, let’s try it out first!”</p><p>Even though he knew that it was a waste of time, Patriarch Wuji still decided to let Xu Xiaoshou try it out. As long as he could forget about the previous unpleasant incident.</p><p>However, what he feared most happened.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were still as cold as ever. He turned his cold eyes and said coldly, “I’ve said it, don’t talk nonsense unnecessarily. Similarly, don’t do anything when I don’t tell you to do it. Don’t ever cross the line!”</p><p>Patriarch Wuji finally couldn’t hold it in anymore.</p><p>How could he not hear Xu Xiaoshou’s insinuation?</p><p>How could this young man be so calculative about a small matter until now?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“I know I’ve let both of you down, and I’ve wanted to make it up. But you shouldn’t have behaved in this manner, should you?</p><p>“No matter what, I’m still your senior. How can you speak to me in such a tone and manner?!”</p><p>Patriarch Wuji was so angry that his face turned red, and even the veins on his neck bulged out.</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around coldly and stepped forward, preparing to use the Divine Array.</p><p>When Patriarch Wuji heard this unbearable sentence and saw the scene before him, he almost laughed out of his anger. “I’m being so polite to you because of Baizhu’an. Do you really think that within such a short time you can grasp…”</p><p>“I’ve told you to shut up!” Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t take it anymore. He looked back and scolded angrily.</p><p>Patriarch Wuji was furious, “What if I say no?”</p><p>“No?”</p><p>The demonic Qi in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes surged, and his killing intent exploded uncontrollably.</p><p>He took out the Four Pillars of Destiny Token of Baizhu’an and threw it onto the ground between the two of them, stirring up sand and dust.</p><p>“I told you to…”</p><p>He had wanted to say ‘shut up’.</p><p>But at this juncture, the Sword Observation Manual, which had been hidden in his mind for a long time, suddenly appeared again. The pages of the book were flipped open, and the demonic Qi, the Fourth Sword, the Four Pillars of Destiny Token, and other inexplicable forces on his body made him change his words.</p><p>“Kneel!!!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were bloodshot, and together with the Swallow the Mountains and Rivers, he threw out the command token. As soon as he finished speaking, the sky shattered, and the earth collapsed.</p><p>Patriarch Wuji’s soul trembled, and his face instantly turned pale.</p><p>He suddenly looked up.</p><p>At that moment, Xu Xiaoshou was no longer that young junior in his eyes…</p><p>Behind the little brat, the illusory images of the three ancestors of the White Vein appeared. Among them, the Great Infernal Ancestor was the most distinct.</p><p>And behind the three ancestors of the White Vein, there was a towering figure of Bazhu’an!</p><p>Patriarch Wuji could almost see the young Bazhu’an conquering everything on the inner island of Abyss Island. Stepping on the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, he pointed his swords at the three ancestors of the White Vein. He was arrogant and aggressive, looking down on the world as he spoke these arrogant words…</p><p>“Both the Black and White Vein respect me! Who isn’t convinced?”</p><p>A boom sounded.</p><p>At this point, Patriarch Wuji finally couldn’t stop his knees from trembling. It was exactly the same as what the three ancestors of the White Vein did in his mind.</p><p>His knees hit the ground with a loud noise and he kneeled down.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
