During these few days, Xu Xiaoshou obediently stayed in the First Pavilion in the Sky and observed the transformation of Dongtianwang City through the Pearl Tower.</p><p>It was very obvious that as the number of trial-takers swarming into the Imperial City increased, the atmosphere in the city became very oppressive.</p><p>In the past few days, all sorts of disputes occurred everywhere.</p><p>And unsurprisingly, the speed of light was suppressed by the Holy Divine Guards of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>As it was close to the crucial point of the Imperial City Trial, even the slightest movement would attract too much attention.</p><p>On the other hand, the First Pavilion in the Sky, other than swaggering about when they came, had been well-behaved for the past few days. They were suppressed by all sorts of conflict news from the various major emerging factions and became the lowest-ranked goalkeeper on the Imperial City’s ranking board.</p><p>If it was not for Young Master Xu’s fame in the past, he might have been completely forgotten by now.</p><p>“So many big shots…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed as he came out from the Pearl Tower.</p><p>The First Pavilion in the Sky was formerly the Pilgrimage Tower. The entire city could be observed from the Pearl Tower. In the past few days, he had observed that the aura above the Sovereign (stage) that had entered the city was no less than a few thousand of them.</p><p>Even the Cutting Path (stage) was more than a hundred.</p><p>And this was only in the name of protecting the trial-takers. It did not include those who were unable to enter the city and were rejected but were eyeing Abyss Island covetously. “The gathering of big shots!”</p><p>The Imperial City had changed tremendously. Xu Xiaoshou had deeply sensed the power brought by Abyss Island. Just the name alone had attracted so many big shots of the five regions. Cutting Path (stage)! If it was in Tiansang City, it would be an existence that dominated an area. In Dongtianwang City, it was like bamboo shoots sprouting after a rain, one after another. As for the Higher Void (level)… Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t sense the aura of the Higher Void (level).</p><p>But he believed that within and outside Dongtianwang City, there should have been a lot of people gathering over the past few days.</p><p>After all, the ones who were truly familiar with the foundational roots of Saint Ascension were the existences of the Higher Void (level) existences!</p><p>From the 108 realms of the Eastern Region and the five domains of the continent, there were too many factions coming over. Just because of Abyss Island, this was the first time Xu Xiaoshou had seen such a high-end gathering of power. It was really…</p><p>Sovereign (stage) and Cutting Path (stage) were everywhere!</p><p>“I’m convinced.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to imagine how the contestants who could only use their Innate (stage) cultivation level to participate in the Imperial City Trial would be able to create waves in such a situation.</p><p>He returned to the first floor.</p><p>A few people sitting at the table in the hall. All the old and the young of the First Pavilion in the Sky were here.</p><p>“Young Master Xu!” When Mu Zixi saw Xu Xiaoshou go down the stairs, she immediately waved her small hand. “Tomorrow is the Imperial City trial. We will gather at the pilgrimage square. With the jade pendant of the trial, the participants will be teleported directly to the Yunlun Mountains through a large-scale teleportation portal. The contents of the trial will only be announced on the same day.”</p><p>“You’re indeed very well-informed,” Xu Xiaoshou smiled.</p><p>“That’s right! Why don’t you take a look at how I’ve been running around these past few days just for the Imperial City Trial?” Mu Zixi’s nose twitched, she was very arrogant.</p><p>These past few days, she and Hua Ying had been having a lot of fun.</p><p>However, with her senior brother’s strict orders, they did not cause much trouble. It was just that they had seen many experts, and they were a little afraid of the Imperial City trial and the Abyss Island.</p><p>“You’re just going to play there!” Xu Xiaoshou jokingly scolded. Xin Gugu’s expression was quite grave, he interrupted, “Young Master Xu, we have walked a few rounds inside and outside the Imperial City. There are too many people! Cutting Path (stage), Higher Void (level)… it is like an airtight encirclement. It is suffocating. These days, the Dongtianwang City has almost been squeezed to the point of bursting by the spiritual cultivator.”</p><p>“There’s no need to worry too much,” Xu Xiaoshou was calm. “To the trial-takers, the Yunlun Mountain Range is the battlefield. To the Sovereign (stage) and the Cutting Path (stage), they only coveted the Sky City. The two are unrelated. The latter probably has no intention of interfering with the Imperial City trial before the Holy Palace Trial.”</p><p>Xin Gugu was not so relaxed. To other trial-takers, that was indeed the case.</p><p>However, he knew very well what the First Pavilion in the Sky was here for! This was one of the Saint Servant’s secret strongholds. If Abbys Island really descended halfway through the Imperial City Trial, would Young Master Xu sit still?</p><p>Impossible!</p><p>None of them cared about the Imperial City Trial, okay?</p><p>They were all here for Abyss Island!</p><p>“A big boss is watching over the big boss’s world. We just need to do our jobs properly.” Xu Xiaoshou walked over and patted Xin Gugu’s shoulder. Xiao Wanfeng lifted the teapot and poured tea for Young Master Xu.</p><p>As the only person in the First Pavilion in the Sky who did not know the inside story, he did not pay attention to Abyss Island at all. He only said with a slightly excited expression, “Young Master Xu, am I going to the Imperial City Trial as well? I’m just a mortal…” “Of course!” Xu Xiaoshou smiled and glanced at him. He knew that Xiao Wanfeng also had the trial jade pendant. This guy was also a person who liked to take risks, “Follow me and you don’t have to worry about your safety. If something happens, you can just give up. No one will lay a hand on you. I reckon they won’t care either.” Xiao Wanfeng’s gesture of pouring the tea froze. His expression became awkward.</p><p>Even though that was the case, it really hurt his feelings… Innate (stage) experts did not value mortals at all, and the Sovereign (stage) and Cutting Path (stage) were even less interested in making a move on him.</p><p>Therefore, to outsiders, the Imperial City Trial was extremely difficult. To Xiao Wanfeng, this was a great opportunity to learn from Young Master Xu.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a sip from his teacup and said slowly, “We’ll set off tomorrow. According to the rules of the trial, Mo Mo, Wanfeng, Mu Zixi, and I, four of us will participate. As for the two of you…”</p><p>He looked at Xin Gugu and Liu Changqing.</p><p>One of them was a Sovereign (stage), while the other was a Cutting Path (stage). Obviously, they did not meet the criteria for participating in the competition.</p><p>“The two of you will first wait at the entrance of the Pilgrimage Square tomorrow. If the situation allows, you can enter together as my guardians. If not we will discuss it.” Enter the square? Xiao Wanfeng was shocked when he heard that.</p><p>Brother Xin and Senior Liu’s cultivation level had far exceeded the requirement. How could they still enter the square? If the situation allowed… What did that mean?</p><p>Liu Changqing smiled, he said, “Young Master Xu, don’t worry. I’ve already checked ahead of time. The teleportation portal in the Pilgrimage Square does indeed have the Divine Secret technique that restricts the cultivation level of the participants, but it wasn’t set up by Hallmaster Dao. Tomorrow, the city trials of the five domains of the continent will open at the same time. Hallmaster Dao doesn’t have the time to set up the Divine Array for the Holy Palace. That’s just the work of some young fellows in the Path Division.”</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. Everything was left unsaid.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also smiled.</p><p>Before he came, he didn’t expect to meet someone like Liu Changqing. He also didn’t expect that Liu Changqing had Patriarch Wuji, whose Divine Secret technique was extremely powerful, to live in his body.</p><p>This was definitely a cheating device. How could he not use it?</p><p>Mo Mo, Mu Zixi, and Xin Gugu, who were at the side, secretly laughed.</p><p>They all knew that even if they failed to cheat, they could still enter the Yuan Mansion, through another method.</p><p>Only Xiao Wanfeng was still in shock. “Young Master Xu, you want to cheat? This won’t do. If it’s found out, it’ll be the trial of red-clothed and white-clothed people. It’s red-clothed and white-clothed!”</p><p>Red-clothed, white-clothed?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but laugh. He had been long going against these two big organizations.</p><p>His identity as a saint servant and a cat in the Yuan Mansion meant that he could only oppose the red-clothed and the white-clothed.</p><p>“Wanfeng!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou patted Xiao Wanfeng and said thoughtfully, “In this world, you have to understand that the rules only restrict the weak people.”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng was speechless for a long time.</p><p>Was this the Demi-Saint’s descendant? Young Master Xu did not care about the rules of the Holy Palace at all. Red-clothed and white-clothed were nothing to him!</p><p>Was he really going to participate in the Imperial City Trial with a Sovereign (stage) and a Cutting Path (stage)? Was he really going to bully others!</p><p>“What about me?” Hua Ying, who was standing at the back, waited from the beginning until the end. She was stunned that she didn’t hear Uncle Xu mention her.</p><p>Her mood went from excitement at the beginning to calmness, disappointment, and then complete despair…</p><p>“Young Master Xu, don’t you want me anymore? I want to participate in the Imperial City Trial too!” Tears welled up in Hua Ying’s eyes. She felt that she had been abandoned by the whole world.</p><p>“Uh, you’re here?” Xu Xiaoshou looked at the back and was speechless for a moment. In reality, Hua Ying was not a person in his plan. The little girl had come to him on her own accord, and she was also a member of the Holy Palace… Sigh, wait!</p><p>A member of the Holy Palace?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked when he thought of this. He had forgotten that Hua Ying was a member of the Holy Palace. He was still focused on discussing how to disregard the rules of the Imperial City Trial.</p><p>“You won’t report me, right?” Xu Xiaoshou wiped away his sweat.</p><p>Hua Ying’s eyes lit up and she immediately reacted. She said excitedly, “Young Master Xu, I won’t if you bring me to participate in the trial.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>Looking at her expression, it seemed like she didn’t think of reporting him at all!</p><p>“I can’t bring you along,” Xu Xiaoshou’s expression was solemn. Hua Ying was a member of the Holy Palace and a direct descendant of the Infernal lineage. She had her position and identity. If he went to the Yunlun Mountain Range, he might have to participate in the battle for Abyss Island. At that time, he would be using the identity of the Saint Servant, Xu Xiaoshou. How could he drag Hua Ying in with him?</p><p>When Hua Ying heard this, her expression turned bitter.</p><p>Before she could say anything, Xu Xiaoshou smiled and said, “But you are a member of the Holy Palace. The purpose of the Imperial City Trial is to select a person for the Holy Palace. If you want to enter the Yunlun Mountain Range, isn’t it easy?”</p><p>Hua Ying was stunned, then she clenched her fist.</p><p>That was right.</p><p>She was a member of the Holy Palace. Why could she participate in the Imperial City Trial?</p><p>She could directly confirm her identity as a messenger of the Holy Palace and follow the participants who were supervising the Imperial City Trial. Wouldn’t that be enough? “I understand.” Hua Ying thought it through and immediately turned around. She only said one sentence, “See you later, Young Master Xu. I have something to do.” Then she disappeared from the First Pavilion in the Sky. What did you understand… Xu Xiaoshou was a little speechless. He hadn’t finished the second half of his sentence and his suggestion was only normal. What was this little girl thinking?</p><p>However, after understanding the Infernal lineage and a little of her background, Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t worried about her safety at all. This girl could do whatever she wanted and let her be.</p><p>Back at the table.</p><p>A few ghost beasts and a junior sister were also lost in their own thoughts.</p><p>“Am I going to bring this group of people into the venue? That should be called ruining the venue…” Xu Xiaoshou thought as he shook his head and sighed. “Everyone prepare yourselves and have a good rest. Tomorrow is the Imperial City Trial. All of you do your best.”</p><p>The next morning.</p><p>The Pilgrimage Square was full of people.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou led a small group of people out and was shocked by the number of people at the entrance.</p><p>The bustling crowd was full of human heads. As far as the eye could see, there should be at least tens of thousands of them!</p><p>Putting aside those who were there to join in the fun, just those at the Peak of Upper Spirit level, Xu Xiaoshou felt that there should be at least ten thousand of them!</p><p>“Is it that spectacular?” His footsteps froze for a moment, and a look of shock appeared in his eyes.</p><p>Behind him, Mu Zixi, Xin Gugu, and the others had clearly never seen such a big crowd before.</p><p>The key was that it was not crowded, but these young talents were all upper spiritual level. Some had long suppressed their cultivation level for the Imperial City Trial, and there were even some who could break through to the Peak of Master (stage). And now, this group of people was squeezed at the entrance of the pilgrimage square.</p><p>Mu Zixi stared blankly, and unconsciously muttered, “If someone throws a spiritual technique into the Pilgrimage Square, wouldn’t the Eastern Sky Spiritual Cultivation world have to go back 30 years?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>Junior Sister is a demon, right?</p><p>He had a scene in his mind. If they threw a nuclear bomb at this crowd, would all the geniuses of the hundred counties in the Eastern Sky World die?</p><p>“Hiss!” Xin Gugu also sucked in a breath of cold air and silently took a few steps away from Mu Zixi.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze was focused and his aura spread out. The crowd couldn’t help but open up a path, and he led the people toward the center of the square.</p><p>“Young Master Xu! It’s Young Master Xu! The fresh Young Master Xu from the First Pavilion in the Sky!”</p><p>“Who is Young Master Xu?” “Hehe, this must be an outsider. He has never even heard of Young Master Xu from the First Pavilion in the Sky. He is a Demi-Saint descendant. He is one of the most important figures in this trial.”</p><p>“Demi-Saint descendant? Nothing is surprising about his appearance. I know that there are too many powerful figures from the five regions who have come this time. Higher Void families, Demi-Saint families. Many of them have appeared in the past few days.” “So what if he’s a Higher Void or Demi-Saint descendant? In the Innate, it still depends on who has a deeper understanding of the Dao. Let me tell you, the ancient swordsmen of the Eastern Region are really great these days. I’ve even seen a few Sovereign of the Way of the Sword!”</p><p>“Hiss, the Way of the Sword Sovereign (stage)? This is crazy. I’m only at the innate (stage).”</p><p>“Hehe, in this Imperial City Trial, any ordinary Innate (stage) wouldn’t be able to make it to the stage. They can only be a bystander. It is because all the geniuses from the five regions are gathered here. If they were in the other imperial cities, they would basically be able to win the championship.”</p><p>“It’s no doubt that these people rushed here for the thing above their heads. D*mn it! It’s clearly for the sake of Sky City, yet they want to snatch our Dongtianwang City’s trial quota and increase the difficulty of the trial. D*mn it!” The clamor rumbled like thunder.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou brought his people into the venue. With his Perception, he could see too many familiar figures.</p><p>Rao Yinyin of Tiansang Spirit Palace, Tan Ji, Su Qianqian, Zhou Tianshen… the first two were at the Peak of the Innate realm, and the last two were also at the Peak of Upper Spiritual level.</p><p>The three swordsmen of the Burial Sword Tomb… These three brothers were here as well? Un, that was not right! The aura of these three fellows had changed. Sovereign (stage) of the Way of the Sword?</p><p>Saint Servant Luo Leilei… F*ck! How could this little girl dare to stand here openly? Wasn’t she already a Master (stage)? Why was there only Innate aura, and the person beside her who was wearing a bamboo hat and holding a walking stick…</p><p>Lei Shuangxing? He must be crazy! This guy came too?</p><p>He wasn’t just an Innate (stage), right?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>He saw many familiar faces. Some of them looked familiar, but he couldn’t tell who they were.</p><p>On second thought, wasn’t that aura the aura of the old men from the big forces?</p><p>All of them had become younger. From the Cutting Path (stage) to the Innate (stage) cultivation level, they all wanted to sneak into the Yunlun Mountain Range?</p><p>“Crazy, they have gone crazy!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. He had thought that the Imperial City Trial and Abyss Island would be two distinct lines, each going their own way.</p><p>He did not expect that from the very beginning, he would use his Perception to see through the great secrets. These people did not want to take it slow at all! “Let’s sneak in first and talk later?”</p><p>“Aren’t they afraid of being discovered?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered and could not help but look at the center of the square.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
