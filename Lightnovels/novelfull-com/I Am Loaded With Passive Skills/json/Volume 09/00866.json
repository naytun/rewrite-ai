He also talked to me…”</p><p>“But I’m Young Master Xu’s people. How could I go with him?” said the little girl who got excited and stood up as she spoke.</p><p>“But he wanted me to go with him!</p><p>“But I refused to go with him.”</p><p>“Then he still insisted that I must go with him…”</p><p>“Stop!” Yi’s head hurt.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that the mental manipulation had failed, he swore that he wouldn’t let this little girl in front of him say even a word of nonsense!</p><p>Yi tried to lead her to the topic to have a better conversation. “Did he want you to be his disciple? How did you get rid of him?”</p><p>“Uh!” Mu Zixi choked.</p><p>Oh yes, Elder Sang was so powerful. How did I get rid of him? What was the situation back then?</p><p>Yi’s expression immediately turned ugly.</p><p>This was obviously a lie. What happened next would depend on how the other party would make it up. However, Mu Zixi’s mind was blank. In the end, she failed to make up anything. She could only say obsequiously, “If… I mean, if I say that I don’t know, will you kill me?”</p><p>Yi was lost for words.</p><p>At that moment, he really wanted to slap this girl to death.</p><p>When Mu Zixi saw that the situation wasn’t right, her tears started to flow again. She hugged her head and squatted down, “Don’t kill me. I really don’t know. At that time, he wanted me to be his disciple, and I rejected him. Suddenly, he didn’t say anything and just left. How would I know the reason? I wouldn’t want to make it up…”</p><p>Yi selectively blocked the rest of the</p><p><b>nonsense.</b></p><p>He narrowed his eyes. Now he could understand what the little girl in front of him had said.</p><p>She was exposed…</p><p>Other than the Saint Servant Sleeveless exposing his aura, a little girl was unable to get rid of the other party. He continued with the topic and asked, “So, after the Saint Servant Sleeveless left, what else happened?”</p><p>Mu Zixi was stunned.</p><p>Was it over?</p><p>Why did this guy not pursue the process anymore?</p><p>How could he accept such a flawed process?</p><p>“Speak!” Yi’s expression turned serious.</p><p>Mu Zixi trembled and was about to cry. “You don’t be so fierce. If you speak in this manner, I will easily associate it with some bad memories.”</p><p>Yi was speechless.</p><p>He simply changed into a passerby and said gently, “What happened next?”</p><p>Mu Zixi completely gave up on making things up. She chose to be an ignorant passerby.</p><p>“Next…”</p><p>“Next is Young Master Xu brought his people over to protect me.”</p><p>She secretly raised her eyes and glanced at the person in front of he. She noticed that the other party was emotionless. The little girl then said weakly, “Let me tell you, Young Master Xu might be a despicable person and is cocky, but he treats me very well. You, you,</p><p>you…”</p><p>She struggled for a moment and chose to close her eyes, as though she was prepared to die bravely. “If you choose to leave now, I can pretend that nothing happened, and I won’t tell Young Master Xu about what happened tonight!”</p><p>Yi was speechless.</p><p>What was this…</p><p>A threat?</p><p>I was the Chief of the Transformation Division. How could I be threatened by a mere Master (stage) lass?</p><p>“Is there anything else?” Yi didn’t care about the irrelevant information at all and asked again.</p><p>Seeing that the threat didn’t work, Mu Zixi sighed in her heart, ” As expected…”</p><p>Suddenly, her eyes lit up. The little girl seemed to have recalled something and said, “Yes! When Young Master Xu came to pick me up, he said something!”</p><p>“What was it?” Yi immediately bent over and sensed that this might be the only key piece of information in the little girl’s entire nonsense.</p><p>Mu Zixi raised her head and puffed out her chest. She said loudly, “Boy!”</p><p>Yi was stunned.</p><p>He waited for a long time.</p><p>But there was no follow-up to the sentence from the other party.</p><p>He finally could not help but twitch the corner of his mouth. “That’s…that’s all?”</p><p>“That’s all,” Mu Zixi spread her hands with a blank look on her face.</p><p>Boy!</p><p>At this moment, Yi could even feel that the other party was fooling him. His face darkened.</p><p>When Mu Zixi saw that the situation wasn’t good, she thought to herself that she really couldn’t make things up. She shrunk her head and said timidly, “Actually, actually, there’s still the second half of the sentence, but I don’t dare to say it…”</p><p>Yi sensed that the situation had taken a turn. He quickly grabbed the little girl’s shoulder and shouted, “Speak!”</p><p>Mu Zixi lowered her head and looked at the pair of hands that were tightly gripping her shoulders. Then, she turned her head and closed her eyes. She looked like she was prepared to die. “Boy! How dare he touch my people?”</p><p>Yi was lost for words.</p><p>At this moment, he felt his heart howling crazily. The monstrous killing intent almost pierced through the sky!</p><p>So it turned out…</p><p>It was all nonsense!</p><p>“Don’t kill me…” Mu Zixi immediately cried out again. “It’s you who asked me to say it. I didn’t want to say it in the first place. I also didn’t beat around the bush, nor did I sand attack you. I also did not point at the mulberry and curse the ghost. I just told you everything I know according to your request. Don’t kill me.”</p><p>Yi interrupted her angrily and roared, “Sneak attack, not sand attack! Also, that’s called pointing at the mulberry and cursing the locust!”</p><p>“Ah?” Mu Zixi’s tears stopped and she asked in a daze, “What’s pointing at mulberry and cursing locust? Did I say that just now?”</p><p>Yi was furious!</p><p>He furiously clenched his fist and hit hard on the ground.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The broken gravel flew in all directions.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
