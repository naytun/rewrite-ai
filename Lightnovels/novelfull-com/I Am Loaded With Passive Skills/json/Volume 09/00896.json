(Part 3)</p><p>He grabbed Patriarch Wuji’s shoulder and lightly exerted force. His five fingers pierced through his opponent’s flesh and blood.</p><p>“Do you dare?”</p><p>A whisper in Patriarch Wuji’s ear caused his hair to stand on end.</p><p>He looked at the cold demonic Qi in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes and felt the terrifying pressure on his shoulder.</p><p>When he lowered his head, he saw the Four Pillars of Destiny Token of Bazhun’an.</p><p>Patriarch Wuji was silent for a long time before he gritted his teeth and shook his head.</p><p>“I don’t dare…”</p><p>He finally straightened his position.</p><p>A pawn would always be a pawn.</p><p>From the moment he was sent out of Abyss Island by the three ancestors of the White Vein, his life was no longer his.</p><p>Under such circumstances, how could he dare to touch Xu Xiaoshou, who might become the chess master in the future?</p><p>Not to mention Baizun’an.</p><p>Just the anger of the three ancestors of the White Vein alone was not something that he, Xuan Wuji, could bear!</p><p>At this moment…</p><p>As if he seized the opportunity during the internal strife among a few of them, Yi suddenly attacked. His soul body turned into a stream of light and headed in the direction of Lei Xi’er.</p><p>“Watch out!”</p><p>Patriarch Wuji immediately reminded him. He tried to make up for his mistakes and give up the fight for control of the Cloud Realm to help Lei Xi’er.</p><p>“Do your job!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou scolded and turned around.</p><p>Why did he need to be reminded?</p><p>The soul body that his Perception focused on was the one that Xu Xiaoshou had been long waiting for.</p><p>Yi’s speed was fast.</p><p>But his bounded domain had been replaced by Lei Xi’er’s White Cave Small World.</p><p>No matter how fast he was, he could not be faster than the master of this bounded domain, Lei Xi’er, and Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes.</p><p>Almost at the same time that Yi moved…</p><p>Lei Xi’er tilted her head slightly, and without any movement, she turned her God Devil Eyes.</p><p>“God Devil Seal.”</p><p>Her red lips opened, and a clear enchanting voice sounded.</p><p>The void trembled, and the God Devil Mist around Lei Xi’er bloomed like a black and white Reborn Lily in full bloom.</p><p>Then, the shadow of Yin and Yang, black and white God Devil Eyes appeared in Yi’s eyes.</p><p>“Uh!”</p><p>In just an instant, Yi’s figure was frozen in the air.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked by this scene before he could even release his Soul Reading.</p><p>He recalled when Lei Shuangxing was fighting against Ye Xiaotian, he had skipped several levels and froze him in midair.</p><p>So, this was the use of the God Devil Eye?</p><p>Yi’s soul body that he was clueless to deal with, Lei Xi’er could just take down using God Devil Eyes directly?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately put down the thought of using Soul Reading. His hands spun rapidly as he muttered something.</p><p>The divine path pattern appeared, and it swiftly sketched a clear and mysterious formation in the air.</p><p>“This!”</p><p>Patriarch Wuji’s eyes instantly widened.</p><p>Wasn’t this the construction method of the Spirit Shifting Six Profound Formation?</p><p>Did Xu Xiaoshou really learn it?</p><p>And looking at the proficiency of it…</p><p>Patriarch Wuji looked at the youth beside him in disbelief.</p><p>What monster was he? He could even learn the Divine Secret technique!</p><p>Moreover, his attainments were so high?</p><p>“Spirit Shifting Six Profound Formation, imperial order!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou received the seal with both hands, and the Divine Secret formation was immediately sealed away.</p><p>The path pattern seeped into Yi’s soul body which was unable to move. Using the Great Paath as a bridge, it communicated with Yin and Yang and opened up a large gap in Yi’s soul body’s second space — the soul space.</p><p>The spatial ring, spiritual weapons, elixirs…</p><p>All the secret treasures were clearly visible!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou skipped the others and first searched for the thing he wanted the most. In the end, he found it in an inconspicuous corner.</p><p>It was a fist-sized stone figurine that looked like a clay doll. It had a head but without facial features, and its body had bare limbs. It was very strange.</p><p>“Is this… the Imitator?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was watching coldly. With a hook of his finger, the divine path pattern was constructed and drew it out.</p><p>“Give it to me!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
