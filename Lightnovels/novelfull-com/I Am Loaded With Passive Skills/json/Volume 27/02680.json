It is a type of ‘vibration’ attribute that could resonate with everything in the world.”</p><p>“He has nine white shadow copper coins that contained the souls of all the ghost beasts that he had killed in his lifetime. They are hidden and can strengthen the artifact. He can release them at any time.”</p><p>White shadow copper coins?</p><p>The second true body looked over in shock, but there was no white shadow. The copper coin was clearly filled with the blood shadow of a ferocious ghost beast!</p><p>Mei Siren saw his student’s confusion, and at the same time, he was certain that this kid had no idea how the Blood Shadow copper coin worked. He quickly added.</p><p>“This white shadow copper coin is one of the top ten Great Psionic Weapons. It can be used to capture and attack, and its power is endless.”</p><p>“When the number of captured soul essences reached the maximum, it can evolve into a Blood Shadow copper coin. Its combat strength… is immeasurable!”</p><p>Immeasurable?</p><p>The second true body felt a chill in his heart.</p><p>What kind of immeasurable method was this? It was rare to hear such a phrase from your mouth?</p><p>And…</p><p>Maximum?</p><p>First generation red-clothed people?</p><p>From the combination of these two words, the second true body seemed to see a lifetime of slaughter, an endless path of blood.</p><p>Most importantly…</p><p>Was this first generation red-clothed people related to the first generation Six Xu that Li Fugui had mentioned on Abyss Island, that was also the first generation of ghost beasts?</p><p>Could it be that this old man had suppressed the ghost beast of the first generation Six Xu?</p><p>With this thought in mind, the second true body turned back to look at the white haired old man, who was still strong and full of killing intent. His feelings changed.</p><p>Wasn’t this old man still as wild as a young man and out to rid the existence of the enemy?</p><p>‘What is the extent of the maximum?” The second true body gulped.</p><p>“Regardless, the Blood Shadow copper coin has overflowed to this extent. When it is stationary, it still emits ghostly cries and and howls like a wolf. It must have cut off at least thousands of ghost beast souls…” Mei Siren’s eyes were solemn. “Maybe more.”</p><p>Thousands, or even more high-level ghost beasts… What level were they? Cutting Path or higher void level?</p><p>Are you kidding me?</p><p>I’ve never even seen so many ghost beasts in my life!</p><p>Were there really such large numbers released in the Inner Island of the Abyss Island?</p><p>The second true body suddenly couldn’t say anything. Perhaps the other questions weren’t important at this moment. He went straight to the point.</p><p>“How does this Fang fellow compare to you, Teacher?”</p><p>Mei Siren shook his head slightly and fell silent. He looked down at the Taicheng Sword in his hand that didn’t belong to him, then turned to look at the Blood Shadow copper coin that had accompanied Fang Wenxin all his life and had been refined to such perfection.</p><p>Once again, the second true body was struck by the sense of the Spiritual Cultivation Era.</p><p>Even Yan Wuse wasn’t at the peak of his Spiritual Cultivation. Was there someone hidden away on the Sacred Mountain?</p><p>“He hasn’t left the mountain for a long time…” Mei Siren sighed.</p><p>The second true body fell into deep thought. Was this equivalent to saying that Fang Wenxin’s sword might have aged, or did it say that he had trained his army for thousands of days and would only use them for a moment?</p><p>Or perhaps, both?</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The ghost beast, Greedy the Cat Spirit’s roar pulled everyone back to their senses.</p><p>“Deva…”</p><p>The second true body came back to his senses and was about to ask the Five Decays of Heaven and Man for his help. After all, this guy’s position was not too stable here.</p><p>However, when he turned around, he had already disappeared.</p><p>He used his Perception to do a retrace. It turned out that when Fang Wenxin threw the Blood Shadow copper coin out of the city gate, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had disappeared.</p><p>“This dog thief!”</p><p>The second true body’s face turned pale and he cursed. He could only look back at the enemy.</p><p>Not only was Fang Wenxin there, but behind this person stood the Kun Peng God, Yu Kun Peng, who was mentioned in Aunt Xiang’s information. He was an old man who had not been anywhere for a long time.</p><p>The last time he appeared was at the Yunlun Mountain Range, but his appearance was symbolic. His combat strength was unknown.</p><p>It seemed like he was about to emerge from the Four Symbols Secret Realm. However, the Holy Emperor Bei Huai had ordered Dao Xuanji and Elder Yu to retreat…</p><p>Was it because he respected the old and loved the young?</p><p>There was also the Elemental Divine Envoy Zhong Yuanzi, Old Bone Ash No. 2. There was even less information about him. There were no historical records of his battles, and his description stated that he was a ‘Spiritual Cultivation research scholar with all the attributes’.</p><p>All the attributes!</p><p>The second true body felt numb.</p><p>This was the first time he had ever encountered a full-attributed Spiritual Cultivator who was a demi-saint!</p><p>What attribute did he major in? He was totally unaware of his surroundings!</p><p>As for the so-called Spiritual Cultivation research scholar…</p><p>Familiar!</p><p>This was all too familiar!</p><p>His main body had yet to fully comprehend all of his attributes and had only grasped a few. He had already begun to study the fusion of attributes and had even created an explosive boundary that could not be abused.</p><p>‘Research scholar’ sounded too tame. If I were to interpret it, wouldn’t it be more of an ‘explosive genius!’</p><p>Even if he couldn’t think straight, just look at his fluffy afro that was still charred, his simple explosion-proof suit that was covered in array patterns, and his kind, old, demented face…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
