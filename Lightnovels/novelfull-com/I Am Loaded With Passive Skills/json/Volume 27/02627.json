I will bring you out of this place first. We’ll discuss other matters later.”</p><p>Without any hesitation, Mei Siren flipped the Taicheng Sword.</p><p>The red plum blossoms drifted lightly in all directions, and the surrounding scenery changed drastically.</p><p>Amidst the bizarre and motley colors, Cao Erzhu only felt that the mountains and forests had rapidly retreated.</p><p>“Space-Time Transition!”</p><p>Mei Siren grabbed the big guy, Cao Erzhu, who hugged the head of the array wheel tightly.</p><p>The Taicheng Sword was the blade and the red plum blossoms were the ties. They turned into a purple-red airflow and entered the spacetime.</p><p>At this moment, Dao Qiongcang’s mocking voice fell from the sky.</p><p>“You want to leave? Did you get my permission?”</p><p>The Thirty-three Heavens Star Weaving array moved and created a myriad of stars that filled the void.</p><p>Under the light of dawn, these myriad of stars were so inconspicuous, but they drove every grass, tree, flower, and stone on Qingyuan Mountain and brought about a divine Transformation.</p><p>“Star studded Illusion Spiritual Sky!”</p><p>With a sound, the east wind blew from Qingyuan Mountain, and the fog enveloped the sky and blocked their view.</p><p>Mei Siren’s Taicheng Sword broke through the void and used the Path Principles to escape. He should have instantly passed through the mountain and moved to another place.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he entered a mysterious world that he did not even recognize…</p><p>This was a desolate and uninhabited desert, but there were strange, jagged rocks and sand that formed a strange array path.</p><p>When he looked up, he saw a natural wave of light. The phantom of a giant dragon and a Kun Peng passed over and filled one with horror.</p><p>Cao Erzhu jumped in fright. His head had almost been lifted off by the dragon’s claws. Fortunately, he lowered his body in time.</p><p>“So beautiful!”</p><p>Soon, Er Zhu’s eyes were filled with amazement.</p><p>The desert, heavenly lake, strange rocks, the dragon and the Kun Peng… all of these were not something that could be seen in a small place like Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>Was this the real Spiritual Cultivation world?</p><p>Just like what was written in the book, it was extremely special and magical. It was beyond the imagination of humans, and the mysteries of the world were unconstrained.</p><p>“Father, you have held me back for twenty years…”</p><p>Cao Erzhu couldn’t help but blame his father. He could have seen such beautiful scenes earlier, but when he thought of his father’s death, it was fine. He could not be blamed.</p><p>“Illusion!”</p><p>Brother Shou’s voice sounded from the array wheel.</p><p>At the same time, Cao Erzhu heard the disdainful sneer of the old immortal Mei.</p><p>“How can a mere Illusion Array withstand a single strike from me?”</p><p>Mei Siren threw the Taicheng Sword high into the air, closed his eyes, put his palms together, and muttered aloud.</p><p>“Appearances are created from the heart and the realm changes with the heart.”</p><p>“My thoughts are clear, all these things are false!”</p><p>He suddenly opened his eyes, and a bright light shot out from them. This time, he did not summon the Present Gods and Buddhas or the sword image.</p><p>With a push of his hands, the Taicheng Sword gently descended and stabbed into the space in front of him.</p><p>An illusory ripple appeared under Mei Siren’s feet.</p><p>“Heart Sword Technique, Waveless slash!”</p><p>He held the Taicheng Sword and thrust it upward.</p><p>“Hua…”</p><p>Cao Erzhu heard the sound of water, it was as clear as if a fish had jumped out of a pond.</p><p>He turned and saw the vertical sky-blue water mark that the old Immortal Mei had drawn out of his sword and the horizontal ripples that spread out from under his feet. They formed two special circles that intersected and canceled each other out.</p><p>The surrounding scenery was also ‘canceled’!</p><p>The strange rocks faded, and the heavenly lake cracked.</p><p>The giant dragon and the Kun Peng were no longer there, and the desert had turned into a mountainous area…</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>When the crack appeared in this special fantasy realm, the illusions that appeared and entered one’s mind were destroyed by Mei Siren’s heart and thoughts. It was cut off with one sword!</p><p>“This is Qingyuan Mountain?”</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s eyes widened. It turned out that they had not left Qingyuan Mountain. They had only come from the top of the mountain to the mountainside. That was all.</p><p>“Good sword technique!”</p><p>When one of the Transformation illusions of the Thirty Three Heavens Star Weaving array broke, Dao Qioncang promptly praised him loudly.</p><p>“Master Siren’s combat strength is the strongest among the demi-saints to be able to break the Divine Array that I personally controlled with such speed.”</p><p>“I can’t help but sigh. As long as an ancient swordsman has cultivated the Fantasy Sword Technique, it’s really difficult to shake their willpower with the illusions in the world.”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>After a pause, Dao Qiongcang’s voice was filled with mockery.</p><p>“It’s still too slow.”</p><p>“Master Siren, who mainly cultivated the Heart Sword Technique, has the ability to break illusions, but as I thought, he doesn’t know much about illusions.”</p><p>“This isn’t…”</p><p>At this point, Cao Erzhu and Mei Siren turned at the same time.</p><p>That was because the voice gradually became more and more distinct, and finally stopped at a short distance away.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang, whose head had been completely restored but was still charred black, stood on the mountain, the divine Sinan in his hand.</p><p>His confidence coupled with his teasing expression and tone made Mei Siren lose his cool as he gritted his teeth in anger.</p><p>“Illusion is not the goal, but the process…”</p><p>After Dao Qiongcang finished speaking, his fingertips turned into afterimages. In an instant, a few light shadows appeared after he fiddled with the divine Sinan.</p><p>“Star studded, Spiritual Prison Sky!”</p><p>Countless ancient bronze doors appeared in the sky.</p><p>These ancient bronze doors were pieced together in an instant and sealed off the entire Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>“Star studded, Spiritual Sky move!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
