She recalled the solemn expression on Hallmaster Dao’s face when he taught them this technique and the terrifying consequences he mentioned. Her body trembled.</p><p>Before she could say anything, Mei Siren waved his fan. “No!”</p><p>There was no hope of success at all!</p><p>It was just a waste of a life!</p><p>“I have a way.”</p><p>At this moment, Cao Erzhu suddenly spoke up.</p><p>Mei Siren and Yu Zhiwen were both surprised. They turned around and asked, “You have a way?”</p><p>They spoke in unison, their voices full of doubt!</p><p>Cao Erzhu was unaware of this, but his tone was reminiscent as he said.</p><p>“I met a senior before. He left me something. He said that when I was on the verge of death, it might be able to save my life.”</p><p>“For Brother Shou’s sake, I will take it out.”</p><p>The senior that Erzhu had met before…</p><p>Mei Siren was delighted. It could only be You Tu!</p><p>You Tu’s main cultivation was the Fantasy Sword Technique. His research on the Way of Space and Time was much stronger than his.</p><p>The Space-Time Transition was not possible, but he could definitely use the Second World. His Second World was more than enough to construct another Yuan Mansion out of thin air, let alone enter Xu Xiaoshou’s Yuan Mansion!</p><p>“Take it out quickly.” Mei Siren was anxious.</p><p>Cao Erzhu reached inside and took out an ordinary sound recording bead that lacked any spiritual senses.</p><p>A sudden hush descended on the entire Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>Sword Deity Mei’s mouth twitched. He sat down, closed his eyes and thought.</p><p>Are you crazy? I’m…</p><p>He actually had hopes that Cao Erzhu could save the situation?</p><p>Even a desperate last attempt would not be so ridiculous!</p><p>“It’s really possible.” Cao Erzhu saw that the old immortal and Yu Zhiwen were silent at the same time. They clearly didn’t believe him, so he couldn’t help but panic.</p><p>“The senior you’re talking about is…” Yu Zhiwen still had some hope.</p><p>She was really anxious. She felt that anything could become a life-saving straw. She could not let go of even a trace of hope, no matter how ridiculous it was.</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s eyes shifted as he spoke out the name of the domineering senior. Everyone in the Spiritual Cultivation world should know about him.</p><p>“Lord Li!”</p><p>This time, it was a direct critical hit.</p><p>Lord Li, who the hell was that!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen couldn’t laugh even if she wanted to. She only felt more pain.</p><p>At this time, don’t pull this sort of ridiculous stunt. Even if you say Lord Xu, I can still hope that you met the swindler Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>Lord Li?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen looked toward the sky.</p><p>Perhaps she was really afraid, but she was still willing to believe that Lord Li could be the savior.</p><p>“You, can give it a try?” She said with extravagant hope.</p><p>Mei Siren sighed. He no longer held on to any hope.</p><p>Cao Erzhu nodded intently. He confidently held the sound recording bead and injected a thread of spiritual senses into it, then raised it high.</p><p>The sunshine beat down upon them.</p><p>The sound recording bead emitted a faint luster. After a long time, it made a rustling sound.</p><p>The world was quiet.</p><p>Mei Siren and Yu Zhiwen looked over at the same time as they waited for the voice to come out.</p><p>At the same time, they didn’t dare to show any hope, as if this would destroy their dream and jinx the entire operation.</p><p>“Sha…”</p><p>The sound recording bead remained silent for some time.</p><p>Suddenly, there was a tearful, helpless voice that sounded as if it was about to collapse, from the inside.</p><p>“Ye Xiaotian, Master Dean, come and save me!”</p><p>At this moment, it seemed like someone had fired a cannon salute into the sky.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen and Mei Siren’s faces were filled with disbelief. Their hearts felt sweeter, happier, and more elated than cotton candy!</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s voice?</p><p>Mei Siren was stunned for a moment, and then his eyes lit up. He realized what this cry for help meant.</p><p>Spatial Upanishad, calling the Saint by his name…</p><p>“Cao Erzhu!”</p><p>He suddenly hugged this big guy’s arm, excited beyond words.</p><p>Yes, it was!</p><p>When everything seemed totally helpless…</p><p>When hope was completely erased…</p><p>When the Holy Emperor appeared, even he might not be able to solve the problem…</p><p>Spatial Upanishad Ye Xiaotian would be able to find the Yuan Mansion and escape with Xu Xiaoshou’s true body. He was the savior of the world!</p><p>It did not matter who he called upon.</p><p>Be it Ye Xiaotian or Xu Xiaoshou whose names were called… in other words, the original owner of the sound recording bead would have a chance of survival no matter what kind of danger he encountered!</p><p>“Hehe…”</p><p>When Cao Erzhu saw that he was being hugged by the old immortal Mei, he scratched his head and laughed. “I said it would be useful, right?”</p><p>“It’s useful!” Mei Siren nodded firmly, that being the most direct affirmation.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen didn’t say anything and just stared blankly at the void.</p><p>She didn’t dare to celebrate in advance. She was deathly afraid of Hallmaster Dao.</p><p>As one of them, she knew clearly what Hallmaster Dao had done in advance in order to prevent these variables from taking place…</p><p>Ye Xiaotian had undergone sanctification and an Upanishad sanctification at that.</p><p>However, it was the Wangze Holy Emperor, a Holy Emperor, who targeted him!</p><p>“Buzz.”</p><p>In just a short period of time, many rules that did not belong to the Divine Path Principles appeared in her Pearl Gem Star Eyes.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was delighted.</p><p>There was a reaction!</p><p>But soon, her enthusiasm was dimmed as if she had been doused by cold water.</p><p>These rules appeared suddenly. Yu Zhiwen couldn’t understand them, but she knew that they did not belong to the Space Order.</p><p>The aura of space was not so cold!</p><p>“Kekeke…”</p><p>“Placing your hopes on the unknown? Xu Xiaoshou must be really stupid!”</p><p>The hearts of the three people present trembled when this sinister and cold laughter sounded from behind them.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen suddenly turned and saw a mass of gloomy grey fog that carried within it a sense of immense darkness.</p><p>She was in complete despair.</p><p>When the gray fog dissipated, a tall figure that wore an orange robe and an orange mask was revealed.</p><p>At the foot of Qingyuan Mountain, a sudden cold and depressing aura appeared. Only the orange-robed man’s cold laugh remained.</p><p>“What can Ye Xiaotian do to help? Why didn’t he call me? The Five Decays of Heaven and Man… is not worthy?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
