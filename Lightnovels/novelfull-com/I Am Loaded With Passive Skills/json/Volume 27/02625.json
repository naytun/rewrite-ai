No matter where you end up, it’s not child’s play!”</p><p>On the horizon, Mei Siren was still indignant and slashed about the mountain wantonly.</p><p>“Master Siren, please listen to me.”</p><p>When he heard Xu Xiaoshou’s words, Mei Siren stopped his actions and suppressed his anger. He raised the Taicheng Sword and held it in his hand.</p><p>Jin Ren took a deep breath and smiled.</p><p>On Qingyuan Mountain, where everything waited quietly, soon a soft voice drifted over.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, if you had accused, rebuked and condemned me when you were in my Spirit Palace, my Dao heart might have collapsed because of this.”</p><p>“But now, what’s the point of saying more?”</p><p>“Do you have hundreds and thousands of bloody, vengeful spirits in your hands?”</p><p>After a brief sneer, the voice turned from weak to impassioned.</p><p>“One general’s success will result in the sacrifice of ten thousand bones!”</p><p>“When everyone is armed and used force on others, you let me be the sacrifice. Is that reasonable?”</p><p>“You can’t repay evil with justice, repay kindness with kindness. You can’t repay an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, can you accept that?”</p><p>“The higher void Lei Family didn’t want to fight, but in the end, they were still separated by the five Saints and their entire family was destroyed. Do you dare to say that you didn’t have the guidance of your Holy Emperor Clan?”</p><p>“If the Xu Yue Grey Palace had not resisted, humans would become ghost beasts, and ghost beasts would still be ghost beasts. The reputation of the red-clothed people will spread. When you deliberately confuse right from wrong, who would not become a ghost beast. Who would benefit from this? Tell me!”</p><p>The more Jin Ren spoke, the angrier he became. Did they really think that he was mute and could not speak after he swallowed the coptis?</p><p>Bullshit!</p><p>Forget about this heaven-shattering sin, but what were you Elder Dao the Flamboyant thinking of? How dare you give me a hard time?</p><p>I am the dignified Saint Servant Lord Shou, how can I take such crap from you?</p><p>“Er Zhu, lift me higher!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu was frightened when he heard his name being called out. He hurriedly raised the head of the array wheel above his head. This amplified its voice.</p><p>He felt that this was a fight between the gods. Dao Qiongcang seemed to be right, but Brother Shou made more sense!</p><p>Moreover, from what he had just said, it was even more impossible to go to the Holy Divine Palace…</p><p>As he thought about this, Brother Shou was like a wild boar that had been pierced. He said sharply.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, the Saint mountain is draped with the banner of justice; it did unjust things and passed it off as being a light, as having shown mercy to the public and kept up a pretense of being kind and virtuous.”</p><p>“But you turned a blind eye to it. You allowed the situation to happen even though people were hurt, right?”</p><p>Qingyuan Mountain was quiet, and there was no response at all.</p><p>“The situation in my homeland and the world troubles me.”</p><p>“I am only a minor figure, but I have no choice but to retaliate in self-defense.”</p><p>“Look at the world. Is there ‘peace’? There’s no need to do anything?”</p><p>Elder Dao the Flamboyant’s arrogance seemed to have disappeared, and there was no response at all.</p><p>Jin Ren sneered and spat. He retracted his aura and said with disdain.</p><p>“You don’t dare to spout nonsense, but you’re still shouting!”</p><p>“I Xu Xiaoshou, am not like a living Bodhisattva at all. How can I allow you to slander me like this?”</p><p>“If you want to splash dirty water, it’s fine if you don’t let me see it before you splash it on me directly… Do you really think that everyone has to respect you and dared not do anything in case you get angry?”</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s head was covered in sweat as he listened, and he could not help but scratch his head.</p><p>Brother Shou was really good at talking. So now, he was the one who was right?</p><p>Mei Siren put away his sword in mid-air and landed on the ground. He felt more satisfied than if he had won a battle.</p><p>Who said that a battle of the Lip Spear, Tongue Sword was not desirable? Sometimes, being eloquent was a kind of ability. At least, one would not be angry. When one went back, he did not have to feel frustrated. He could refute it at that time.</p><p>At the waterfall behind Back Mountain, Yu Zhiwen spun a divine path pattern and looked with envy at the blurry array wheel.</p><p>Before this, Dao Qiongcang was the number one in the world in terms of having a glib tongue.</p><p>She was often annoyed at Hallmaster Dao, but she felt helpless. She felt that what the other party said was very reasonable.</p><p>She had also seen many important figures who were silenced by Hallmaster Dao. They valiantly ascended the Saint mountain in high spirits, only to return home in a dejected state.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was something else.</p><p>At least, this was the first time Yu Zhiwen had seen someone who could render Hallmaster Dao speechless and vent his anger on the spot.</p><p>As for ‘truth’…</p><p>Those who fought for the Great Path, who did not know the truth?</p><p>It was just based on their own words and abilities!</p><p>The Qingyuan Mountain great array shook for a long time before it echoed with a sound. It was directed at Cao Erzhu,</p><p>“Erzhu, if you don’t pay attention, in the end you will see who will benefit.”</p><p>“Perhaps the First Pavilion in the Sky did this just to make you join them.”</p><p>This voice was very calm, as if Brother Shou’s scolding didn’t affect him at all.</p><p>Cao Erzhu scratched his head and looked at the head of the array wheel. Sure enough, it exploded.</p><p>“You coward, you don’t dare to come out and still dare to blab about here?”</p><p>“I dared to tell Cao Erzhu not to join the First Pavilion in the Sky, but can you guarantee that you won’t set up a trap to make him lean towards the Holy Divine Palace. Then in the end, you’d just make use of him?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang laughed coldly. “Do you dare to guarantee it? Do you think your words are credible?”</p><p>“My words are not credible! I’m such a person who goes back on my word!” Jin Ren laughed.</p><p>“Elder Dao the Flamboyant, don’t try to goad me. It’s useless.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
