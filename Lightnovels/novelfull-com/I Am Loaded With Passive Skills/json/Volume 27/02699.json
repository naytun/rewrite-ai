He quickly covered Brother Fang’s mouth as he was about to say something outrageous.</p><p>“There’s an answer. We actually have the answer!”</p><p>Fang Wenxin glared at him coldly, but Elder Yu glared back at him and spoke in a low voice.</p><p>“You have a death wish?”</p><p>“A new official will want to show off his ability and courage. Do you want to be punished as an example to others? Who are you trying to show off to?”</p><p>“Going by her methods, Little Dao has already become the example. He won’t be able to make a comeback. Now, you want to be the second example?”</p><p>Why were these humans so ignorant of the ways of the world?</p><p>Elder Yu was extremely sorrowful. Being in a dilemma was too tiring. He already missed the time when Little Dao was still around.</p><p>After all, being a good-for-nothing was too enjoyable!</p><p>Whether it was a meeting or a conference, he didn’t even have to come out to fight. He just needed to come out and let off some steam when he needed to.</p><p>At that time, as a member of the Council of Ten, he only needed to master this skill and everything would be settled:</p><p>“I second that.”</p><p>Or another skill… If he was slow, he could only use the following:</p><p>“I agree too.”</p><p>As he sighed, Elder Yu glanced at Zhong Yuanzi from the corner of his eye and saw that he had secretly condensed something big. He rubbed his chin as he stood in front of the Xuanji great array, and he had a curious look on his face.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Elder Yu was shocked and quickly threw out a three feet long fishing rod. He reeled the guy over and pressed down hard on his afro.</p><p>He was disappointed.</p><p>In the past, he was the naughty one, and Little Dao was the one who was in charge of everyone…</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>Elder Yu then saw his cute and intelligent, doll-like great-granddaughter walking toward him. He wanted to greet her, but his hands were fully occupied.</p><p>It was all Dao Xuanji’s fault that she did not manage the situation well!</p><p>Why did Little Yu seem to be in such low spirits?</p><p>Oh, maybe so many people died in the city so she would be sad for a while… Ah, that d*mned Dao Xuanji!</p><p>Dao Xuanji didn’t seem to notice this, or perhaps she didn’t care at all. She only asked again, “So, the answer is?”</p><p>Fang Wenxin hesitated.</p><p>He could imagine how much of an impact it would cause if he said an inaccurate but bad answer in front of everyone.</p><p>Dao Xuanji remained silent and watched calmly.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang.”</p><p>Fang Wenxin’s voice was very low. As soon as he lowered his head, he seemed to have aged dozens of years. “What Xu Xiaoshou said was not very credible.”</p><p>“Who was it?” Dao Xuanji asked.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang!” Elder Yu turned around and shouted and his voice made the surroundings shake. “Dao Qiongcang was responsible for the appearance of the ghost beast!”</p><p>In Jade Capital City, it was suddenly so quiet that one could hear a pin drop.</p><p>Fang Wenxin looked back in shock and hurriedly shouted. “But it was Xu Xiaoshou who…”</p><p>“Who was it?” Dao Xuanji interrupted. “I only care about the results, not the process.”</p><p>Fang Wenxin stopped abruptly.</p><p>He finally realized that Dao Xuanji might have known something back at the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>She just pretended to be ignorant and exerted this pressure on me. She wanted to use my words as a sheath and saw herself as a knife that was tightly grasped in her hands!</p><p>I treated you with good intentions, but the effort went unappreciated…</p><p>Fang Wenxin suddenly felt extremely uncomfortable.</p><p>He had lived in seclusion for many years. After there was a change to the red-clothed people, he no longer wanted to come out of the mountain.</p><p>This time, it was because Yue Gongli was not around and the Saint Stage ghost beast made an appearance. He didn’t want to participate in the changes on the Sacred Mountain.</p><p>The world is like a chess game and I am a chess piece.</p><p>Just because he didn’t want to get involved didn’t mean that others would let him off.</p><p>As he faced the tens of millions of people in Jade Capital City, Fang Wenxin closed his eyes.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang!”</p><p>These three simple words rang out like thunder.</p><p>After a short pause, a huge commotion broke out in Jade Capital City.</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao? That is impossible!”</p><p>“How is it impossible? Didn’t you see how the Divine Secrets Array broke? If it wasn’t for the timely appearance of the Xuanji great array, we would have died!”</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao had already betrayed us. He is no longer that Hallmaster Dao! I heard that after he killed someone on the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, he fled to avoid punishment…”</p><p>“But colluding with the ghost beasts… How was that possible?”</p><p>“How could that be impossible? He had been in power for more than 30 years. Who knew how much he had stolen? Look at this Divine Secrets Array. If it hadn’t been emptied of its resources, how could it have shattered so easily?”</p><p>“I don’t believe it…”</p><p>“I believe you! Hallmaster Xuanji is our savior!”</p><p>Rumors flew about like a blizzard all over the city.</p><p>High up in the sky, Fang Wenxin trembled violently after he spoke up. He grabbed Elder Yu’s arm tightly for support.</p><p>“I am ashamed of the name Wenxin…”</p><p>Elder Yu clenched his fists tightly, and the fishing rod exploded. However, he managed to restrain it in time, so he did not dare to let it explode again.</p><p>“Sigh.”</p><p>He could only let out a long sigh, just like Mei Siren who was outside the city.</p><p>He endured it.</p><p>Dao Xuanji sneered slightly and her blank eyes were filled with slight emotion. She raised her voice and announced.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang colluded with a ghost beast, killed a judge, and fled. He has been sentenced to death and is wanted by the five regions!”</p><p>“Ye Xiaotian left the Holy Palace without permission and secretly helped the Saint Servant. He will be imprisoned in the Dead Sea and a date will be set for a trial!”</p><p>“Ghost beast Greedy the Cat Spirit wreaked havoc in Jade Capital City and caused countless deaths and injuries. Fang Wenxin from the red-clothed people, listen up and kill it immediately!”</p><p>“The Southern Region’s Xu Yue Grey Palace colluded with the Saint Servant and secretly nurtured a Body of Devour They should be punished for this crime.”</p><p>As if she had already planned it, she announced all the crimes, one after another. After she was done, Dao Xuanji waved her horsetail whisk and released her aura.</p><p>“Everyone in the Holy Divine Palace, listen up. My first decree after taking office is to clean up the Southern Region and let righteousness be upon the Heavens.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
