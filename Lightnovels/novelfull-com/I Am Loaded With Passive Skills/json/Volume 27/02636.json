Her lips were bloodless and her eyes were bleak and filled with disappointment.</p><p>Dead…</p><p>Through the Qingyuan Mountain great array, she could clearly sense that Xu Xiaoshou, who was in the head of the array wheel, was dead!</p><p>At this moment, the control of the Qingyuan Mountain great array had indeed returned to Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>But…</p><p>She didn’t fight for it herself.</p><p>It was Hallmaster Dao who didn’t want to play anymore and threw it over.</p><p>If this had been a trial for the divine energy movement, Yu Zhiwen knew that the answer sheet she handed in would be a big fat zero.</p><p>She couldn’t even get a passing score, let alone a full score?</p><p>After she struggled in the Spiritual Protection Sky for so long, analyzed and deduced it for such a long time…</p><p>Yu Zhiwen did not get anything!</p><p>Hallmaster Dao was still the Hallmaster Dao. When he didn’t want to make any concessions, no one could surpass him.</p><p>“I… could not do anything…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen placed her hands on the ground as tears of blood trickled down her cheeks.</p><p>Her body trembled.</p><p>This feeling of powerlessness and defeat was worse than being killed.</p><p>If she had known that this would be the outcome, she would not have entered the starlight Spiritual Protection Sky!</p><p>Even if she rushed over recklessly, and went to Xu Xiaoshou’s side…</p><p>At the very least, he had died halfway, died under the power of the Spiritual Draw and struggled on his own.</p><p>And now?</p><p>Now, it seemed like she had chosen to give up Xu Xiaoshou in order to survive and seek protection.</p><p>“I survived, but he died…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s mind was blank and there was a buzzing sound in her ears.</p><p>She suddenly thought of why the starlight of the Spiritual Protection Sky did not fall directly on her body but to the side.</p><p>Could it be that this was an additional test from Hallmaster Dao?</p><p>He had already given her the clearest direction!</p><p>He could even speak on her behalf to Xu Xiaoshou… He mentioned those things…</p><p>But because she wasn’t firm enough and chose to run away, Hallmaster Dao became ruthless and killed him?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen collapsed feebly onto the ground.</p><p>She held her head in her hands, unable to believe that she was actually so weak!</p><p>“No, I just thought that I could crack the Qingyuan Mountain great array and snatch back the control…”</p><p>“You are deceiving yourself!”</p><p>“No, I was nearly there. If I had deduced the divine secret and obtained control…”</p><p>“If, what ‘if’? You’re merely ranked second on the Path Division, yet you want to defeat Dao Qiongcang? Are you dreaming or are you just deceiving yourself? Don’t you know the answer?”</p><p>In her mind, her two selves started to fight. Yu Zhiwen felt more and more miserable, as she dug her nails deep within the sand.</p><p>She couldn’t even find out which one was her real self!</p><p>Did she not think of this at that time, or did she blatantly chose to ignore this…</p><p>Was she really conceited, or did she pretend to be conceited…</p><p>When everything was set in stone, it seemed like all of this was meaningless. Yu Zhiwen suddenly hated herself and Hallmaster Dao even more.</p><p>However, for some reason, the voice of Hallmaster Dao barged into her mind again.</p><p>“Follow your heart and pay attention to your safety.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen suddenly came to her senses, and raised her eyes that shone brightly again.</p><p>The one that died was Xu Xiaoshou’s incarnation…</p><p>There was still room for redemption…</p><p>Hallmaster Dao was still in action. He still fought and targeted people!</p><p>If she really fell at this time, she would sink into depravity.</p><p>The so-called ‘persistence’ from before would really become a self-deceiving form of cowardice. Yu Zhiwen would no longer be Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>“Teleport!”</p><p>The Qingyuan Mountain great array trembled and an illuminated gate appeared. Yu Zhiwen wiped away her tears of blood and quickly entered it.</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>Cao Erzhu apologized to the old immortal Mei and especially to the dead lump of iron, Brother Shou.</p><p>“Actually, I knew that it was an illusion, but I just can’t get out. I… Sigh!”</p><p>He really wanted to explain why he didn’t dare to come out. He didn’t even want to come out.</p><p>However, those things were all contained in his stomach. Cao Erzhu had a mouth, but he couldn’t speak. He could only apologize.</p><p>However, if an apology was of any use, Brother Shou would not have died…</p><p>“Pa!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu slapped himself hard. “I won’t be like this in the future.” He said firmly. “Father is already dead!”</p><p>Mei Siren seemed unaware of the self recrimination of the person beside him, and he was powerless to stop Er Zhu.</p><p>He had never placed his hopes on the younger generation.</p><p>He hated himself for not being strong enough to protect his students.</p><p>“Erzhu, you can go back.”</p><p>Mei Siren looked up at the sky, and the killing intent around him gradually condensed.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang still wanted to kill Xu Xiaoshou’s main body. He knew that he could not let this happen.</p><p>However, Cao Erzhu could no longer help with any of the following matters.</p><p>Even though he had a killing intent, it was difficult for him to find Xu Xiaoshou’s main body. He might not even be able to help!</p><p>“Old Immortal, I can’t leave.”</p><p>Cao Erzhu shook his head firmly. “I am also a member of the First Pavilion in the Sky. I have to help too.”</p><p>Mei Siren didn’t say anything.</p><p>For the first time, he felt that he was not smart enough.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had clearly entered into an intangible life-and-death game with his students before.</p><p>He didn’t even know how Xu Xiaoshou’s spiritual senses died in the end-it was like a piece of trash!</p><p>“Buzz.”</p><p>An illuminated gate appeared next to him and a figure emerged from the backlight.</p><p>Mei Siren and Cao Erzhu were both shocked. This could only be Dao Qiongcang’s doing.</p><p>This was because the Divine Secrets Array on Qingyuan Mountain had the name Dao stamped all over it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
