He only looked at the adorable pet and he had a happy expression on his face.</p><p>“Little fellow, you’ve always used your Engulfing Power to swallow things. Have you ever truly experienced what it feels like to ‘eat’?”</p><p>“Meow?” Greedy the Cat Spirit scratched the fur on its lower body.</p><p>“We humans have many delicious things to satisfy our appetites, such as steamed fish, braised meat, braised pork trotters, savory chicken…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang gave examples one by one, and he leisurely used the Divine Secret technique to outline the form of each dish.</p><p>He could even simulate the alluring fragrance and fanned his hands to let the aroma waft into Greedy the Cat Spirit’s nose.</p><p>“Gulp…”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit salivated and gulped but it did not quite understand.</p><p>“However, if these things are swallowed by the Engulfing Power, you won’t be able to taste them.”</p><p>“You can’t experience the sweetness and saltiness, you can’t taste the bitterness and spiciness. You will forever only know the concept of being ‘full’ and being ‘hungry’.</p><p>“Everything that enters your stomach, no matter how rare it is, will taste the same as my Great Annihilation Technique.”</p><p>“How could you live in this manner in this world?”</p><p>“You are the Saint beast of the Xu Yue Grey Palace, but you haven’t even eaten real food. Aren’t you wasting your life?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang played on its emotions and said, “Do you think I’m right?”</p><p>“Meow…” Greedy the Cat Spirit hesitated; it was not sure if this was right or wrong.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang sighed as if he felt sorry for it.</p><p>He took out a palm-sized piece of thick meat from his spatial ring. The meat glistened with a golden brown color and oozed with fat and was filled with a strong spiritual energy.</p><p>There were also streaks of blood on it. It looked extremely tender and palatable.</p><p>“Little guy, have you eaten dragon meat before?”</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>A stream of golden light scattered in the air.</p><p>The Ancestral Tree Dragon Apricot’s spiritual physique was rooted among the space-time fragments and anchored at the small town at the foot of Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>As soon as they left the Apricot Realm, Dragon Apricot remembered everything.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s escape plan, its betrayal and abandonment…</p><p>Everything that happened, appeared!</p><p>In just a short time in a day, the Dragon Apricot lost two bets.</p><p>Before this, it even swore that it would defend the Apricot Realm to the death…</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that it had been raised from the chaotic era until now and had an incredibly indestructible thick skin, Dragon Apricot would have even contemplated suicide today.</p><p>The spacetime fragments and storms continued.</p><p>This couldn’t hurt the Ancestral Tree Dragon Apricot’s spiritual physique at all, but its dignity and pride disintegrated into pieces!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot trembled as it turned Xu Xiaoshou’s body over.</p><p>It knew that at this moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s body was his main body, and his consciousness was in the awakened clone.</p><p>As expected, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes opened within his ruddy face.</p><p>“Success!”</p><p>His escape plan had mostly been successful when he opened his eyes.</p><p>All that remained was to wait for the main body to return.</p><p>Since the main body had already left the Apricot Realm, his consciousness could switch back from the Apricot Realm at any time…</p><p>It could be said that in this vast world, it was impossible for Dao Qiongcang to find him when he was under the protection of the Ancestral Tree, Dragon Apricot!</p><p>The second true body wanted to laugh.</p><p>He laughed at Elder Dao the Flamboyant’s lack of strategy. After today, he would be free and out of trouble. With this lesson learnt, there would no longer be a day where he would be controlled.</p><p>He laughed at the Spirit of Dragon Apricot’s lack of intelligence and how it dared to bet with him. From the beginning, it was destined to fail.</p><p>Just when he wanted to mock it…</p><p>The second true body turned around and saw that its body was protected by a branch of the Spirit of Dragon Apricot.</p><p>Beside him, there was a silver-haired woman with her eyes closed and her beautiful figure was wrapped in the golden branches.</p><p>Weng!</p><p>The second true body’s mind buzzed.</p><p>“She… Who…?”</p><p>“Lei Xi’er, your junior sister!”</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot chuckled apologetically.</p><p>It just wanted to hide its embarrassment and did not want to hear Xu Xiaoshou’s mockery at all. It said this as if to cover up the ridicule.</p><p>“This woman is still unconscious. Aren’t you afraid that she would die at the hands of that Dao chap?”</p><p>“Relax, I’ve already brought her out!”</p><p>After a pause, the Spirit of Dragon Apricot took out the Bodhi Root, the semi-saint person and all the other precious items.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I have brought all the treasures of the Apricot Realm. You don’t have to worry.”</p><p>Crack!</p><p>A thunderbolt suddenly erupted on a sunny day.</p><p>The second true body was petrified.</p><p>He felt like he had been punched in the back of his head, or perhaps he had forgotten something after his rebirth.</p><p>He asked in a trembling voice. “The me before… That me! In the plan, did I ask you to… bring these out… ?</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot raised its head, and a red light flashed in its eyes as it proudly waited to be praised.</p><p>The second true body’s mentality instantly exploded. He roared hysterically,</p><p>“No?</p><p>“If I didn’t ask you to bring it, why the f*ck did you bring it?”</p><p>“Why do you have to be such a wise guy? Why did you do something that was so useless and inappropriate? You idiot!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
