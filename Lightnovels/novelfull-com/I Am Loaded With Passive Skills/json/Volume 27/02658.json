He was sitting there with a smile, looking calm and elegant.</p><p>Suddenly, his eyeballs bulged out and became bloodshot.</p><p>The sudden pain made him unable to help but cover his forehead and let out a muffled groan.</p><p>After a long while, he finally recovered.</p><p>“Hu… Finally, it’s over.” Dao Qiongcang let out a long sigh and stood up from his seat.</p><p>The surroundings were extremely quiet. Even Xiao Qi was not there. Only the squeaking sound of him pushing the seat when he got up echoed.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s upper body was leaning forward, and his hands were pressed on the silver table. It was unknown what he was thinking, but his eyes were a little out of focus.</p><p>Soon, he smiled sadly and sorted out the messy documents left by Xiao Qi on the table.</p><p>After quickly sorting the stacks of paper and several jade scrolls, he stored them into his spatial ring one by one.</p><p>After some thought, Dao Qiongcang placed the spatial ring on the table.</p><p>He turned his body sideways, adjusted the main seat, and tucked himself under the table.</p><p>Then, he looked to the front again and looked up at the Saint Hall that he had stayed in for nearly 40 years in a daze.</p><p>The silver table looked brand new, shining brightly.</p><p>The chairs around it varied in height. Some of them could accommodate the size of the Divine Oracle envoy, while others could accommodate the size of a normal human.</p><p>“Golden Light is a sign of good luck!”</p><p>“Elder Yu, keep your fishing rod. You poked me…”</p><p>“That’s not right. Why would it explode?”</p><p>“Everyone, quiet down. Let’s listen to what Little Dao has to say. Don’t spout nonsense.”</p><p>“All votes passed!”</p><p>“It has been hard on you, Hallmaster Dao…”</p><p>In the blink of an eye, everything was in the past.</p><p>Without exception, none of the ten chairs were occupied.</p><p>“Is this human emotion?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang raised his eyes and carefully comprehended something. Suddenly, path energy circulated around his body, and Holy Power surged.</p><p>With a flip of his palm, the fluctuation was suppressed.</p><p>“I worked and toiled all day, and have been sucked dry of my spiritual energy and ambition. My luck has run out, and I no longer have a place to return to.”</p><p>He looked up at the door. The sky was as bright as day, illuminating all that was under. Dao Qiongcang lamented silently, “How cursed. So this is all that’s left… I was so focused on dealing with the outside world that I neglected what I had. What a pity… I was so close. If only I had half a day more, things wouldn’t have ended so hastily.”</p><p>“If only…” Dao Qiongcang laughed softly as his thoughts were cut off and sighed.</p><p>His footsteps faded into the distance.</p><p>In the silence, the black silhouette calmly walked out of the gate of the Saint Hall.</p><p>The figure seemed to have aged a lot, and there was a sense of desolation and loneliness.</p><p>Of course, there was also relief.</p><p>…</p><p>A door away, Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe was bustling with people.</p><p>“Look, look! Someone is coming down from the Stairway to Heaven!”</p><p>“That’s… one of the newly crowned emperors. Who are the people behind her?”</p><p>“Gold robe and jade crown, white pattern on the left collar and red pattern on the right collar… You must be new, right? They are obviously from the Judicial Division!”</p><p>“Judicial Division?”</p><p>“You haven’t seen them before, have you? The last time those people went down the Stairway to Heaven, Moonless Sword Deity was removed from his post, lost an arm, and thrown into the Dead Sea. There has been no news of him since then. Now…”</p><p>“Someone is going to get into trouble again? Who is it?”</p><p>“I don’t know, but it definitely won’t be Hallmaster Dao. However, it must be a very serious. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have convened the Sacred Mountain Conference…Speaking of which, hasn’t the Sacred Mountain Conference been held too frequently recently?”</p><p>The few figures walking on the stairway gradually became more apparent.</p><p>The leader was Dao Xuanji, who was dressed in a black robe and had long hair tied up. He had light eyebrows, thin lips, and empty eyes.</p><p>She held a horsetail whisk in her hand, neither sad nor happy. Behind her were three people from the Judicial Division.</p><p>One of them held an edict, one held a sword, and the other held a seal. There was arrogance on their faces, and they looked like ants.</p><p>“Swoosh…”</p><p>When the four of them landed on the ground, the energy of demi-saints fluctated on top of the noisy Guizhe Sacred Mountain.</p><p>“Look, look!”</p><p>“The Council of Ten’s Kun Peng God Elder Yu and the Elemental Divine Envoy Zhong Yuanzi…”</p><p>“Including the Ninth Divine Priest, there are only three of them. Where are the others? Only three have come for such a big battle today?”</p><p>“That red-clothed person… What a terrifying aura. Who is that old man? I’ve been on the Sacred Mountain for so many years, but I’ve never seen him before.”</p><p>“Is that Fang Wenxin? How is that possible? Even he has come…”</p><p>“Is he very strong?”</p><p>“This isn’t a matter of strength. He’s a first-generation red-clothed person. Do you know what that means?”</p><p>“First-generation red-clothed person? The one who suppressed the first generation of Six Xu…”</p><p>“Shh…”</p><p>Although the Council of Ten rarely made their appearance, everyone had seen them before.</p><p>Among the demi-saints, the most eye-catching one was the old man in red who had an unparalleled murderous aura.</p><p>His face was full of wrinkles, his sideburns were white, and his red robe hid half of his body and hands. Only the nine copper coins hanging from his waist were eye-catching.</p><p>The copper coins were strung together, each piece glowing red. There was a faint ghostly wail and wolf howl coming from within, which was heart-wrenching.</p><p>“Old Master Fang, this way please.”</p><p>After Dao Xuanji landed, he stood on Dao Qiongcang’s usual seat and even extended his hand to the side.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
