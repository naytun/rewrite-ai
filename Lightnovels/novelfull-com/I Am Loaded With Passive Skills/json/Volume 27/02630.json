The world inside the ancient bronze door no longer had any directions, be it north, south, west and east. Within it, all hell broke loose.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang strode through the dark sky; sometimes he stood upright, at times he leaned sideways…</p><p>His body swayed with the gravity, but he always stood ramrod straight.</p><p>Vague sounds came out from his mouth or flew in from all directions. When the people heard these sounds, they combined into words that could be easily understood.</p><p>“True despair isn’t death after being unable to resist, nor is it death after one encountered danger.”</p><p>“It’s the wait and the loneliness. It’s being awake and in pain. It’s living a life worse than death and dying with hatred.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang hung upside down in the air as he looked down at the darkness below. The divine Sinan shimmered and gave him an eerie and terrifying appearance.</p><p>“In order to kill you, I set up a trap from the Four Symbols Secret Realm and lured the Holy Emperor Qilin into the arena. I used the power of Bei Huai as a restraint…”</p><p>“In order to kill you, I borrowed the Guidance of the Ran Ming ruins to avoid the involvement of the god slayer and cut off the support of the Saint Servant…”</p><p>“In order to kill you, I used Xiang Yaoyao as bait and secretly rendered Cao Yihan immobile. I drove Rao, Zhu and Ye away and suppressed the Holy Palace. I used the Golden Gate Technique. I was on guard against everything…”</p><p>“I cleared everyone out of the area and minimized the variables to the lowest, weakest, and smallest extent so it would be within my control.”</p><p>“Even so, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man still managed to trick me. Heh, Xu Xiaoshou, you’re too hard to kill.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang sighed and smiled, as if he still had regrets that he had not been smart enough.</p><p>However, the words he said in such a calm tone made people’s hearts turn cold.</p><p>Mei Siren subconsciously clenched the array wheel in his hand.</p><p>He had heard of all these incidents!</p><p>After that, he received a message from Bazhun’an that said that he needed reinforcements, so he rushed to Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>However, he did not expect that the essence of all this chaos was Dao Qiongcang who targeted Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>That’s not right…</p><p>The initial chaos after the Four Symbols Secret Realm’s Holy Palace Trial started was caused by the Saint Servant Cen Qiaofu who underwent sanctification. This was when the Saint Servant attacked!</p><p>The appearance of the Ran Ming ruins, the restriction of the Saint, the absorption of people into the ruins… it was the will of the god slayer that was comparable to the will of the Ten Ancestors. How could an outsider control it?</p><p>The Holy Emperor Bei Huai had a thought incarnation that fought with Xu Xiaoshou, but it seemed like his goal was only for the ghost beast… And this battle ended when the Ultimate Giant tore apart the Holy Emperor Qilin. That was a victory!</p><p>The Wangze Holy Emperor chased and killed the Spatial Upanishad Ye Xiaotian to the Holy Palace. In the end, he fought against Bai Long, who was also a Holy Emperor. No one saw the battle, and no one knew what happened.</p><p>Why use a sledgehammer to kill a chicken?</p><p>This wasn’t a battle between the Holy Palace and the Holy Emperor aristocratic family!</p><p>Wouldn’t it be a joke if they only invited the Wangze Holy Emperor to come out and restrain Ye Xiaotian?</p><p>But now…</p><p>Dao Qiongcang said that everything was targeted at Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>“Evil words meant to mislead!”</p><p>Mei Siren sneered.</p><p>Who didn’t know how to act after hindsight? It was nothing more than raising such a matter to elevate themselves and then it would be easier to intimidate others.</p><p>“No, no…” Dao Qiongcang waved his hands.</p><p>“I said so much not to show off or deify myself, but that he would have a clear understanding of his death.”</p><p>“Helplessness in lucidity, pain in despair!”</p><p>Along with this sound, the gravity changed, and Dao Qiongcang’s body righted itself.</p><p>He had a creepy smile on his face as he pointed at the head of the array wheel and said softly.</p><p>“He said that the Struggle for the Great Path required bloodshed. What’s the point of playing house? What I want to show him is the real battle of the Struggle for the Great Path!”</p><p>“Oh?” Jin Ren spoke up. “Now that you’ve put it this way, I really want to hear what the real ‘Struggle for the Great Path’ is.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s eyes lit up as he pinched his fingers and said.</p><p>“Come to think of it, you were severely injured by Bei Huai and fainted from the overdraft. You were supplemented by various Holy Medicines, the life Attribute Upanishad array diagram and various life-saving methods that even I do not know of… You should wake up soon?”</p><p>Jin Ren’s heart skipped a beat when he heard that.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had even thought of this?</p><p>“Do you know why you are still alive?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang smiled faintly. “Did your delaying tactic succeed, or did I not factor in everything?”</p><p>Jin Ren’s heartbeat started to palpitate as he soon understood why the Emperor Dragon Scale had accelerated to such a degree.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was also waiting?</p><p>He was not concerned about himself, but about the danger to his true body that the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale had predicted!</p><p>But what was he waiting for?</p><p>“You’re right!”</p><p>“I’m waiting!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was overjoyed. “But I’m different from you. I’m not waiting for people, nor am I waiting for luck. I don’t have to wait for those messy Transformation… I am purely waiting for you.”</p><p>After a pause, his eyes burned as he looked through the dark environment of the sealed ancient gate. His tone turned into ridicule,</p><p>“Oh, it doesn’t seem that simple either?”</p><p>“I’m still waiting for you to save Xiang Yaoyao, for Zhu Yike to replace you, and for Master Siren to defeat me… I’m waiting for you to succeed!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s expression turned extremely cold.</p><p>“When you successfully ascend to heaven, I’ll send you to hell. That will be the true despair. That will explain the so-called ‘Struggle for the Great Path’!</p><p>This pervert…</p><p>Jin Ren’s feelings were in a turmoil. Could the ‘flamboyant’ in Elder Dao the Flamboyant be interpreted in this way?</p><p>“This is hell?” He looked around with his spiritual senses and everything he saw was blurry and dark. Everything was chaotic, and he almost lost the concept of space. However, he smiled and said.</p><p>“Elder Dao the Flamboyant, you can’t kill me!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
