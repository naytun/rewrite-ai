The two of them had conflicts.</p><p>Now, he deepened this conflict!</p><p>In the midst of his complaints, he cleverly omitted the appearance of Aunt Xiang, The Divine, Ye Xiaotian, Mei Siren, and the others. Naturally, they had only appeared because they were concerned about him.</p><p>When he was satisfied, he talked about the battle on Abyss Island that Elder Sang definitely didn’t know about.</p><p>In this battle, he rode on the Holy Emperor black dragon and fought against Wangze Holy Emperor with the power of the Four Divine Pillars and killed Rao Yaoyao in one strike.</p><p>Of course, he also skipped the process when he became Mei Siren’s disciple. After all, he was extremely talented and had a photographic memory. He could learn everything by himself.</p><p>He also emphasized how disgusting Bazhun’an was. He had planned the overall situation and exploited him to death. Then in the end, he came out to enjoy the victory and snatched the secondary plane door.</p><p>“I didn’t ask for it, so does that mean I don’t want it? Of course not!”</p><p>“I was waiting for him to give it to me. After all, I was the one who contributed the most during the battle on Abyss Island! The first to achieve victory!”</p><p>“This fellow didn’t even sweat at all. In the end, he took away the secondary plane door in a high-handed manner… Wow!”</p><p>“Listen, don’t you think that dog thief is even more disgusting than Elder Dao the Flamboyant?”</p><p>“Yes.” Elder Sang listened quietly and made a remark from time to time, regardless whether it was about Bazhun’an or Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Didn’t I tell you in the Eighth Palace that the ancient swordsmen are all idiots? I told you not to trust that guy, but you didn’t listen? Now you’re reaping what you sow, okay?”</p><p>“How was this self-inflicted…” Xu Xiaoshou was scolded until he was dizzy. When he heard that, he wanted to scold Elder Sang again, but he suddenly thought of the scene before he underwent a cultivation deviation.</p><p>He fell silent.</p><p>My backer had never been Long Rongzhi.</p><p>“Rumble! Rumble!”</p><p>The Higher Void World was not stable.</p><p>After the two of them underwent several attacks, even if they did not fight, it had already begun to collapse in large areas.</p><p>Time seemed to be limited…</p><p>“Are you currently at the god slayer ruins?” Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the world that was falling apart and changed the topic.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Doesn’t that mean we can escape?”</p><p>“No, even if I don’t die there, I will only return to the Dead Sea after I come out.”</p><p>“Oh, that’s what I thought too. I’m really smart…”</p><p>Elder Sang found it funny.</p><p>Even if he wasn’t in high spirits, the only person who could subconsciously praise himself was Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Remember to come to the ruins when you have time. I’ve left something good for you there. Remember to find a good hiding place so that you won’t be ambushed.” Elder Sang said.</p><p>“What good stuff?” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Elder Sang didn’t tell him directly. “It’s something that is coveted by everyone. Even Bazhun’an might want it…”</p><p>Even Eighth Brother coveted it?</p><p>Even an ordinary Holy Emperor wouldn’t be able to sate his appetite. Did he want to be deified and become a God?</p><p>Just as he was about to speak, Elder Sang shook his head and smiled. “You don’t have to ask, if the item is not with you, you won’t remember it.”</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>I won’t remember…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sucked in a breath of cold air. Could it really be related to his being deified and becoming a God?</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>At this moment, his mind suddenly shook, and a large number of fragmented images were transmitted over.</p><p>There was a strange ghost beast that wreaked havoc on Qingyuan Mountain, the Blood Shadow copper coins outside Jade Capital City, and an old man with a fluffy afro who was very fun to play with…</p><p>There was the Five Decays of Heaven and Man who was well hidden among the Path Principles and who forcefully activated the Blood World Pearl; there was the Ancestral Shadow Staff that was suddenly taken away from the Ancestral Tree Dragon Apricot, and there was a fool who shouted wildly…</p><p>“Kings, princes, generals and ministers, are they of different species?!”</p><p>When that sentence exploded in his mind, blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that the scene in front of him had become so unreal. The wrinkles on Elder Sang’s face had blurred a little, as if someone had beautified it.</p><p>The world in his mind was the real one. The pain of being cut at the waist also called out to him…</p><p>Jin Ren?</p><p>Oh no, it was the second generation Jin Ren.</p><p>The things he saw were the scenes he was experiencing in the Shengshen Continent. Was he telepathically connected to them?</p><p>“Rumble! Rumble!”</p><p>The rapidly collapsing Higher Void World spread to where the master and disciple sat in the center.</p><p>Elder Sang was not in the least moved by the strange phenomenon. He just looked at the young man in front of him and said, “You should go back.”</p><p>“No, I can’t! It’s all a dream!” Xu Xiaoshou shook his head. He couldn’t tell reality from illusion. He had been asleep for too long.</p><p>“I will protect you and ensure the complete return of your consciousness and soul.” Elder Sang stood up, and there seemed to be light that swirled under his feet. “Remember to communicate with me through the Black Flame God if you’re in trouble in the future. The virtual image’s function is not only to fight, but also for communication.”</p><p>“No! That’s impossible!” Xu Xiaoshou felt that everything around him was blurry. He couldn’t get up or move. His butt seemed to be stuck to the ground.</p><p>Elder Sang smiled at this stubborn child and stopped exerting force. With a bang, the ground under their feet shattered.</p><p>The infernal white flame pounced over.</p><p>The distance was so close that in the blink of an eye, it was far away.</p><p>During their second meeting, Elder Sang became very reserved. He no longer gave any advice and was purely a listener.</p><p>The child in his eyes had grown up, but he had instead become that talkative child, who never seemed to stop talking.</p><p>It was hard to meet up and even harder to part.</p><p>When the figure in his line of sight was so far away that it almost became a small dot, Xu Xiaoshou could not hold it in anymore.</p><p>He stood up among the shattered chaos. His soul consciousness withdrew slowly out of the Higher Void World, but he could still shout loudly.</p><p>“D*mned old man, I’m already at the Sovereign Stage!”</p><p>The white light was extremely eye-catching amid the chaos. Elder Sang, who seemed to be standing on the scroll, calmly put his hands behind his back and read the implication behind his words. He replied.</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou reached out but he could not touch anything.</p><p>“Even the Holy Emperor is a little afraid of me. Even if all the demi-saints were to emerge, I can destroy them with a flip of my palm!”</p><p>Elder Sang laughed.</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt miffed again. He held his hand in front of his mouth and shouted.</p><p>“Actually, I already knew that this was your Higher Void World!”</p><p>“Good…” Elder Sang’s calm and indifferent reply was only halfway through when his voice suddenly became abnormal and even more agitated.</p><p>“I knew it! I knew it! You rebellious…”</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The white flame engulfed everything.</p><p>Before Xu Xiaoshou’s tearful face that was like a villain who had finally achieved success could fully take shape, he suddenly felt that there was something off about his consciousness. Reality and illusion intertwined.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The chaos world was gone.</p><p>The shattered Higher Void World was no longer there.</p><p>The last thing he saw was a bloody mouth filled with sharp canine teeth. It suddenly bit down and slashed at his waist.</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was in so much pain that his soul was about to split apart. He suddenly opened his eyes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
