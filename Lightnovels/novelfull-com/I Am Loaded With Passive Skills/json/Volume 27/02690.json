It was just a projection of his memories.</p><p>However, just as the feeling of warmth and comfort spread throughout his body, his soul and will seemed to be taken over by something.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>He heard the sound of an explosion in his mind.</p><p>A huge, blurry virtual image of a white flame appeared behind him.</p><p>This virtual image was in human form. He wore tattered straw sandals, a straw cape, and a straw hat. The only difference was that his hands were charred black and sleeveless. There was an illusion of the Nine Dragons Burning the Ancestor Saint Statue on his back. It was like a nesting doll, the virtual image was inside the Saint Statue.</p><p>“Yo, you’re here again?”</p><p>When the voice came from somewhere, the world spun and Xu Xiaoshou arrived at a familiar world.</p><p>This place was a vast expanse of white, lit by fire at every few feet. It was clearly Elder Sang’s Higher Void World, that he had visited before.</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>Elder Sang?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around abruptly and saw a slightly unruly figure that stood behind him with a teasing expression.</p><p>This person’s face seemed to be engrained with the vicissitudes of life and his attire differed from what he knew. He was dressed like one of the white-clothed people, and emblazoned across his chest was the word ‘Prisoner’. His hands were scorched and thin, and from time to time, a white flame mixed with devilish energy would appear…</p><p>“D*mned old man?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was overjoyed!</p><p>Who else could it be but Elder Sang?</p><p>Elder Sang seemed to have readied his form in advance. He faced the newcomer sideways as the white flame swayed and showed his graceful form.</p><p>The dim light concealed his sparse hair after he lost the straw hat and added a sense of mystery and coldness.</p><p>When he heard that, he was furious. He flashed in front of this traitorous disciple and suddenly raised his hand to hit him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou dodged.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>The normal Sleeveless scorched hand drew a crack in the air, and even the Higher Void World echoed with a sound as if it was overwhelmed.</p><p>Elder Sang’s hand halted when it reached Xu Xiaoshou’s head, but he did not hit him in the end. There was a hint of disappointment in his eyes.</p><p>He wasn’t sure if Xu Xiaoshou’s Body of Consciousness could withstand his knock…</p><p>Even if it could, the Higher Void World would not be able to hold on any longer…</p><p>The two of them, one tall and one short, looked at each other in silence. The white flame around them fluttered with a ‘Pfft’ sound.</p><p>Tears welled up in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes.</p><p>Elder Sang also showed a rare hint of gentleness.</p><p>Amid his blurry vision, he sized up this disciple, whose appearance and height differed greatly from the disciple in the Spirit Palace. He lowered his hand and sighed softly.</p><p>“You’ve grown up…”</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>Unexpectedly, the tearful Xu Xiaoshou suddenly tore off his sleeves and his arms were charred black. He was caught off guard as he received a huge slap.</p><p>“Take that!”</p><p>With a bang, Elder Sang was so immersed in the warmth that he did not react in time. His eyeballs bulged, his chin moved, and his entire face was askew after being hit.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hit him hard on his chin and half of his cheek. Elder Sang was like a rubber ball as he flipped a dozen times in the air before being whipped toward the horizon and disappeared into the stars.</p><p>He lowered his hand.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gasped.</p><p>“F*ck, I’m not dreaming?”</p><p>“This move felt like the real thing?”</p><p>Rumble…</p><p>The Higher Void World suddenly trembled violently, and cracks appeared.</p><p>White flames spewed out in all directions like an erupting volcano that vented its anger. It vaguely transformed into a huge, wriggling, burning, and expanding Dragon Melting Realm.</p><p>“Traitor!”</p><p>A hysterical roar rang out. Elder Sang, whose face was swollen and had even lost a few of his teeth, dropped from the sky.</p><p>The Sleeveless red-scorched hand suddenly struck toward the top of Xu Xiaoshou’s head!</p><p>“F*ck, is this for real? Wait, d*mned old man, I didn’t do it on purpose. I thought I was dreaming just now. I’ve had a lot of dreams recently…”</p><p>“Is this how you treat me in the dream?”</p><p>Elder Sang’s anger erupted from his seven orifices, and the power of his attack increased instead of decreasing.</p><p>“Ah!” Xu Xiaoshou was so scared that he hugged his head and curled up on the ground. He trembled and did not dare to resist at all.</p><p>Whoa.</p><p>Elder Sang could not bring himself to kill Xu Xiaoshou and his palm halted before it landed on Xu Xiaoshou’s head.</p><p>He let out a long sigh, flipped over in the air, and landed gracefully. He displayed the tolerance and magnanimity of a teacher.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly jumped up and as a stream of golden light emerged from his leg, he kicked out at his chest.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Elder Sang’s eyes bulged, and his expression of disbelief and shock remained even as his body was sent flying.</p><p>“Elder Dao the Flamboyant, even if you were reduced to ashes, I would still recognize you!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wiped his nose and sneered. After he looked around, he said in surprise.</p><p>“I must say, your imitation of the Higher Void World is pretty good. The Divine Secret was hidden and not released. Even I could not see through its profundity.”</p><p>“What sort of technique is this? Great World Technique?”</p><p>White light flashed in the distance.</p><p>Elder Sang limped over; he had clearly lost any will to resist.</p><p>“You brat… Puff!” As he spoke, he coughed hard and two teeth came out together with the blood.</p><p>“Yo, such a vivid performance. What tricks are you up to now?” Xu Xiaoshou was on his guard.</p><p>Elder Sang hadn’t even finished his sentence when he heard what he said. He was so angry that his eyes rolled back and he almost fainted.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
