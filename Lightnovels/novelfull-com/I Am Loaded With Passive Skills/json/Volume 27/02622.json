(2)</p><p>Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>This name was easy on the ears and suited his taste. What mattered most was that there was still the old immortal around.</p><p>This old immortal gave him a sense of being part of a ‘family’, even though it was just a chance encounter at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>This was something that others would find difficult to achieve regardless of the length of time they spent together.</p><p>After his father’s death, the only straw Cao Erzhu could grab onto in this world was the old immortal and Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Don’t listen to Master Siren’s nonsense. The First Pavilion in the Sky is nothing. If the Holy Divine Palace wants to attack, they can destroy it with a flip of their palms.” Jin Ren spoke hurriedly, with a hint of reproach in his voice.</p><p>Mei Siren chuckled and didn’t say anything else.</p><p>He understood that Xu Xiaoshou was really thinking for Cao Erzhu and not for himself.</p><p>As expected of my old student!</p><p>“Brother Shou what about you?” Cao Erzhu looked at the head of the array wheel. Although he didn’t think that the lump of iron was someone with status, he respected him as an equal.</p><p>“What matters most now is you. Your attitude is the most important!” Jin Ren did not give him a direct answer.</p><p>“I…” Cao Erzhu was confused. “Anything is fine.”</p><p>“Maybe it’s not that urgent?” Mei Siren spread his fan. He knew that Cao Erzhu didn’t know much about this world, so he should get more information before he made his choice.</p><p>“Elder Dao the Flamboyant won’t give him time.” The voice that came out of the head of the array wheel was very serious. “Passive selection and active selection are very different.”</p><p>Mei Siren was silent. He knew about his student’s past.</p><p>With regards to this point, Xu Xiaoshou had the most say.</p><p>“Dao… was that him?” Cao Erzhu pointed to the sky. He could already match the person that Brother Shou spoke about in the conversation.</p><p>“Yes, his name is Dao Qiongcang. He’s as famous as your father, and they’re both from the Ten High Nobles.” Jin Ren said without any scruples. Anyway, what should be heard would be heard.</p><p>“What faction is he from?” Cao Erzhu felt that the name Dao Qiongcang was very familiar. He should have heard it a few times.</p><p>Jin Ren was silent for a moment. This was a little messy.</p><p>He knew that if he said it directly, it would definitely cause Cao Erzhu to misunderstand. He was still considering it…</p><p>“He is the current Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace!” Mei Siren answered with a smile, as if he had expected that his student’s words would be contradictory.</p><p>“Ah?” Cao Erzhu’s expression immediately became extremely resistant. He waved his hand at the array wheel. “Then I won’t join the Holy Divine Palace. He’s not a good person.”</p><p>“Hiss, how should I put it…” Jin Ren felt helpless as the many faces of Elder Dao the Flamboyant flashed through his mind.</p><p>“He’s indeed not a good person in the strict sense, but he’s not an absolute bad person either. Let’s just treat him as… someone neutral…”</p><p>“The Holy Divine Palace is even bigger. Elder Dao the Flamboyant is definitely tolerant. He would not mind about the punch you gave him just now.”</p><p>“The white-clothed people’s philosophy is very much in line with your personality.”</p><p>“As long as you don’t bother about anything else and focus on the elimination of the various dark factions on the continent, the white-clothed people would be the best place for you.”</p><p>Dark faction… Cao Erzhu’s eyes darted from the empty night sky to the old immortal Mei. Finally, they landed on the head of the array wheel and asked.</p><p>“The white-clothed people are good?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>“The First Pavilion in the Sky is bad?”</p><p>Jin Ren had no answer for this.</p><p>He didn’t think so, but the outside world should think it was.</p><p>Mei Siren laughed and waved his fan. “Nothing is absolute in this world. Nothing is black or white.”</p><p>“But many things are black and white. There are no gray areas between right and wrong when it comes to major issues.” Cao Erzhu said firmly.</p><p>Both Jin Ren and Mei Siren were shocked. Was this Erzhu’s stance?</p><p>Who said Er Zhu was not smart? He had great wisdom hidden in the heart!</p><p>“Father said it…” Cao Erzhu added guiltily.</p><p>“Your father is right. ” Jin Ren said solemnly. “Judging from the current situation, the First Pavilion in the Sky is bad. It is the opposite of the Holy Divine Palace and is the dark faction!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu looked back at the old immortal.</p><p>He saw that there were thousands of sword-wielding students behind the old immortal. This was the sign of a person who was truly respected.</p><p>“The Holy Divine Palace might not be completely good, but there’s still the white-clothed people…”</p><p>“The First Pavilion in the Sky is a dark faction, but the old immortal must be a good person…”</p><p>Cao Erzhu muttered to himself; there were still traces of confusion in his eyes. ‘I don’t really understand, but it seems like I can accept it.”</p><p>This was indeed very complicated. It was unclear and hard to explain. Jin Ren understood Er Zhu’s dilemma.</p><p>Cao Erzhu quickly sorted out his thoughts and asked again. “What about my father?”</p><p>“He’s just like You Tu. He’s free and unfettered. He did not take any sides at all.” Mei Siren said.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>This was the first time Jin Ren had spoken up so resolutely against his teacher.</p><p>Mei Siren was a little surprised. “Alright, let’s hear it.”</p><p>Jin Ren’s spiritual senses had been to Changde Town, so he knew about Kui Leihan’s stance. “A passive wild crane on an idle cloud is different from an active wild crane on an idle cloud. He said seriously.</p><p>Cao Erzhu was deep in thought.</p><p>Was his father trapped in a small town?</p><p>He suddenly yearned for the old man’s lifestyle. Perhaps what he really wanted was that kind of life!</p><p>Jin Ren spoke again.</p><p>“As you can see, although I’ve never met Elder You Tu, I’m certain that he only took this as a temporary initiative.”</p><p>“Once there are changes in the outside world, he won’t be able to stay idle.”</p><p>“Even after he entered the game, he could no longer control his own initiative. He will be even more passive than your father!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s eyes became even more confused.</p><p>He thought hard, but could not think of a reason.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
