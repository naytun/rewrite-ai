His red tiger-like eyes blazed as he shouted.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Erzhu?</p><p>Mei Siren was shocked.</p><p>Cao Erzhu, why did you come up?</p><p>This was Dao Qiongcang. If he were to intervene in the battle and get crippled by the Divine Secrets Array, that would be disastrous.</p><p>“Child, go down now.” Mei Siren hurriedly controlled the sword image and stopped his attacks.</p><p>However, Cao Erzhu did not listen to him. He only turned his burly and determined back on him and continued to glare at Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>Cao Erzhu…</p><p>Dao Qiongcang knew that he had come with Mei Siren, but he did not know why this child was so hostile towards him.</p><p>However, he was certain that he had seen Cao Erzhu before.</p><p>When they first met at the blacksmith shop, he had determined that this child was not an ordinary person and could be one of his helpers.</p><p>As long as he could remove the influence of the layer of obstruction, Kui Leihan…</p><p>“Erzhu, do you still remember Uncle?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang stopped his control over the Qingyuan Mountain great array. He extended his hand as a gesture of a friendly handshake.</p><p>He recalled that Cao Erzhu was very interested in the Divine Secret technique!</p><p>Who would have thought that when Cao Erzhu saw this hand gesture, he suddenly became so furious that his eyes seemed about to pop out. He suddenly pulled his hand back.</p><p>“God Punishment Tribulation!”</p><p>He attacked without giving any explanation!</p><p>In an instant, the sea of lightning that filled the sky turned into endless threads that crossed the limits of spacetime and pierced into Dao Qiongcang’s acupuncture points.</p><p>At that moment, Dao Qiongcang was stunned.</p><p>His Holy Power was temporarily stopped!</p><p>Even his control of the Qingyuan Mountain great array was delayed!</p><p>The numbing sensation brought about by the Penetrating Divine Senses and the God Punishment Tribulation made his reaction speed much slower than usual.</p><p>When he regained his senses, Dao Qiongcang realized in shock…</p><p>Cao Erzhu pulled his hand back. The lightning streaks that pierced into his body turned into a large hand and pulled him in front of Cao Erzhu.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu bared his teeth like a furious beast. He grabbed Dao Qiongcang’s neck with one claw and hit out with his right fist.</p><p>The God Punishment Tribulation that was wrapped around his fist slowly seeped into the muscles of his right arm as the distance increased.</p><p>“Buzz…”</p><p>The Path Principles were cracked by the electric charges and the space was destroyed by lightning.</p><p>Even the skin on Er Zhu’s hand was unable to withstand the power of the God Punishment Tribulation that was compressed into it; it withered and cracked.</p><p>In the end, his entire arm swelled up like the last lightning pillar of the saint calamity. He aimed it directly at Dao Qiongcang’s head and brazenly smashed it.</p><p>Possession type, Penetrating Divine Senses!</p><p>Thunder God’s Fist!</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>One punch!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s neck and body were still in Cao Erzhu’s hands, but his head was sent flying instantly.</p><p>The lightning drew a bright purple line under the night sky. At the end of it, Dao Qiongcang’s head was embedded in the space…</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>It was completely shattered!</p><p>The moment when the lightning lit up the night sky!</p><p>Cao Erzhu only felt that the rush of blood, the surging emotions and that kind of anger, all of it had been thoroughly vented!</p><p>In his mind, an image of his father’s head in a wine barrel appeared…</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s eyes were filled with tears as he violently flung the broken body in his left hand away. It was as if he had slaughtered a wild boar, and he felt a sense of victory!</p><p>The world fell into silence and waited.</p><p>It was as if Qingyuan Mountain still hoped for something.</p><p>Cao Erzhu felt that he should say something at this time?</p><p>Coincidentally, the person in the pile of scrap metal had also taught him…</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>He let out a roar that belonged to a man.</p><p>Under the night sky, under the shocked gaze of the old immortal, he resembled a fierce gorilla in the mountains as he pounded his chest with all his might.</p><p>He bent down with his hands hanging by his side. When he raised his head and thrust out his chest, he had transformed from the ordinary man on the ground into the dazzling light of the night sky.</p><p>In the most heart-wrenching way, he poured out all his strength and shouted goodbye to the past twenty-six years of his mortal life.</p><p>“Are kings, princes, generals, and ministers born better than others?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
