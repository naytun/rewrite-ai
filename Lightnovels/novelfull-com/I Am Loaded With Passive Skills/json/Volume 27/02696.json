My leg!”</p><p>“Disaster! This is a great disaster!”</p><p>“A great calamity is coming. What is Hallmaster Dao doing? I don’t want to die, I don’t want to die!”</p><p>Wails and screams rang out in all directions.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian frowned as he watched the scene unfold. He could not bear to see this happen, so he opened up the Spatial Upanishad array diagram beneath his feet.</p><p>“Lord of Ten Thousand Realms!”</p><p>He raised his hand, and layers of spatial bounded domains were embedded. They provided temporary protection for the residents of Jade Capital City and separated the viewers of the battle from the actual battlefield.</p><p>“Boom boom boom…”</p><p>The impact continued.</p><p>The world seemed to have gone crazy and only the dazzling explosions projected a false calm.</p><p>“Sigh.”</p><p>Mei Siren sighed.</p><p>He only slowly raised his sword, and in the midst of the destructive disaster, beautiful red plum blossoms drifted down.</p><p>“Plum blossoms…”</p><p>“This, why are there plum blossoms here?”</p><p>The red plum blossoms in the snowy sky were fragrant, and Jade Capital City was no longer the proud city it was.</p><p>The people in the city were stunned. Some of them pinched the rare plum blossoms between their fingertips and the sword energy cut through their skin with a sizzle.</p><p>However, the damage was minimal. Instead, it added some gentleness to this world-destroying explosion.</p><p>“Swish.”</p><p>The Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation spread out and instantly covered the entire Jade Capital City.</p><p>Above the sky with the Taicheng, Mei Siren leaped up and was about to cut off the nine tails that could destroy the world, with a single sword strike…</p><p>At this moment, a sharp cry broke through the series of explosions and echoed all around the people.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang betrayed the Holy Divine Palace and escaped from the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe. He destroyed the great array and released the ghost beast Greedy the Cat Spirit to bring harm to all the living beings!”</p><p>“Hallmaster Xuanji is compassionate and has mercy on the world. She will raise the great array once again and save Jade Capital city!”</p><p>Weng!</p><p>The light of the Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation was covered by the Celestial Scroll.</p><p>Jade Capital City was suddenly filled with complicated divine path patterns. These patterns formed a brand-new Saint Stage Divine Secrets Array, the Xuanji great array, that protected the ground below.</p><p>“The Dao of prohibition.”</p><p>The indifferent female voice descended. Black chains of the Path Principles emerged from the Xuanji great array and captured the nine-tailed Greedy the Cat Spirit.</p><p>“The Dao of sky shattering.”</p><p>With a loud bang, the Lord of the Ten Thousand Realms was pierced through from the inside out by the Xuanji great array.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian turned around in disbelief, but he could only groan in pain as he spat out a mouthful of blood and flew backward.</p><p>However, at the same time, black chains that also contained prohibition magic coiled around his body like pythons.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s eyes were filled with horror.</p><p>No matter how fast the space attributes were, it was not as fast as this backstabbing.</p><p>Amid the chains on his body, there were numerous weapon prohibition orders. At a glance, there were no less than thirty of them.</p><p>This was suffocating!</p><p>What virtue and ability do I have left?</p><p>“I’m here to save the people! I’m saving the people! Dao Xuanji, you idiot…”</p><p>“This Dao, silence.”</p><p>With a whoosh, the Xuanji great array rippled like a curtain made of water.</p><p>The sounds of explosions from the city walls and the trapped Ye Xiaotian’s curses, could no longer be heard in Jade Capital City.</p><p>“This Dao, no swords.”</p><p>The black chain followed the Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation and extended toward Mei Siren at the Southern Zone city gate!</p><p>“Heart Sword Technique, Wisdom…”</p><p>Mei Siren originally aimed the Taicheng Sword at the nine tails in the sky, but he could only change his direction when he heard the voice.</p><p>When the sword turned, it was aimed at the tens of millions of humans in Jade Capital City.</p><p>Even though Mei Siren was usually a mild-mannered person, at this moment, he couldn’t help but be furious and almost spat out blood.</p><p>I’m here to help!</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was also there to help!</p><p>No one was there to help the ghost beast. Everyone’s focus was on how to save Jade Capital City.</p><p>How could this Xuanji great array not distinguish right from wrong and attack its own people after its descent?</p><p>How, how could this Heart Sword Technique be used against Jade Capital City?</p><p>At this moment, the furious Mei Siren really wanted to raze Jade Capital City with a single sword strike, and at the same time, completely wipe out that indifferent and ruthless voice.</p><p>With just a flash of scarlet in his eyes, Mei Siren who specialized in the Heart Sword Technique, knew where the problem was.</p><p>He restrained his mad impulse.</p><p>The Wisdom is Emptiness was nothing, and it could only cut through the chains of the Way of the Heavens.</p><p>After he ended up in the same miserable state as Ye Xiaotian, Mei Siren could no longer enter the Xuanji great array to save the others.</p><p>He could only suppress his radical heart and endure the trembling of his sword and hands.</p><p>Just endure it!</p><p>“Kings, princes, generals, and ministers, are they of different species?!!”</p><p>Someone couldn’t stand it!</p><p>Cao Erzhu was furious.</p><p>How could there be such a bad person?</p><p>If he had the ability, he would have come out long ago. Why would he launch sneak attacks at demi-saint Ye and Old Immortal Mei at this critical moment?</p><p>Er Zhu’s eyes were bloodshot. The God Punishment Tribulation exploded into a sea of lightning around him. With a monstrous aura that was like a roaring wave, he punched toward the Xuanji great array that covered Jade Capital City.</p><p>“Come back!”;</p><p>This sudden outburst gave Mei Siren a fright.</p><p>They were separated by a great distance, one was in the sky and the other was on the ground. He felt his entire body go numb and could not react for a moment.</p><p>When he regained his senses, Cao Erzhu’s fist was already close to the Xuanji great array!</p><p>“Erzhu, no!”</p><p>Mei Siren spun around and red plum blossoms flew about in the sky.</p><p>He did not try to stop him, but used a little of the Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>“What? Father!” Cao Erzhu was so scared that he collapsed to the ground. “No, no, I didn’t mean to hit you…”</p><p>“This Dao, no thoughts!”</p><p>The voice seemed to be startled for a moment before the black chain reached out towards the Southern Zone gate.</p><p>Mei Siren gritted his teeth and swallowed his blood. He stepped into the air, grabbed Cao Erzhu, then turned around and ran off.</p><p>As an ancient swordsman, he had to deal with the Saint Stage Divine Secrets Array, Dao Xuanji, Fang Wenxin, Yu Kunpeng, and Zhong Yuanzi…</p><p>How could he defeat them?</p><p>This time, Dao Xuanji had calculated everything and used the lives of the people of Jade Capital City to cut off the fate of the Saint Servant and the First Pavilion in the Sky!</p><p>“We’re saved!”</p><p>In Jade Capital City, countless people looked up and rejoiced.</p><p>The figure of the real savior floated down from the sky as she faced the snow and osmanthus.</p><p>She was dressed in a regal divine robe that was embroidered with stars. She held a horsetail whisk in her hand, and there was a hint of arrogance hidden between her brows.</p><p>After she cast a sweeping glance toward the south, she did not pursue him. She looked back at Jade Capital City and said in a voice that seemed to come from high above the clouds,</p><p>“The Xuanji great array will protect Jade Capital City for another hundred years.”</p><p>“I am Dao Xuanji.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
