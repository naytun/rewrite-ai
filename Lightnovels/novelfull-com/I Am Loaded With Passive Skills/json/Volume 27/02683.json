The second true body suddenly turned around and saw the source of the sound at the same time. It was the Greedy the Cat Spirit who had lost control…</p><p>No!</p><p>It came from inside its body!</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit managed to break free from the Blood Shadow copper coin for a short while; now its body was distorted by the continuous explosions that occurred.</p><p>Bulges formed on its neck, abdomen, and back in succession and erupted from its body.</p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere. Greedy the Cat Spirit was riddled with holes from inside out after being blown apart.</p><p>And what came out of its body along with the explosion were masses of body parts that belonged to the Physique Division.</p><p>There were limbs, internal organs, bones, and even a cute head with a fluffy afro…</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi!</p><p>The fragmented parts of Zhong Yuanzi’s body clone were pieced together in the sky. Very quickly, they turned into an incomplete version of Zhong Yuanzi’s main body that had only one arm and one leg.</p><p>The second true body was stunned.</p><p>What kind of ability was this?</p><p>Without too much ado, Zhong Yuanzi, who was under the plaque at the Southern Zone gate, melted into a pool of blood. He quickly transformed into an arm and merged with it.</p><p>As for the blood that the second true body had just touched, he originally wanted to feed it to the Imitator and secretly learn the use of all its attributes.</p><p>At this moment, it also squirmed and turned into a calf covered with leg hair. It flew away with a swoosh and inserted itself into Zhong Yuanzi’s incomplete body and combined to turn into a complete human body.</p><p>“Great!”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi shouted in mid-air. No one knew what he was up to but under the cover of the Holy Power, he quickly put on another explosion-proof suit.</p><p>When he came back, it was as if he had not suffered any injuries at all!</p><p>“Ah, this…”</p><p>The second true body looked down at his hand. The demi-saint’s blood had disappeared.</p><p>When he looked at the Southern Zone gate again, the guy who had been sent flying by his kick had indeed disappeared.</p><p>This newly created being in front of him was Zhong Yuanzi’s main body?</p><p>“That’s not quite right?”</p><p>At this moment, Xin Gugu’s image flashed through the second true body’s mind, and he realized something.</p><p>“Blood attribute?!”</p><p>He was certain that what he had hit just now was Zhong Yuanzi’s main body. The latter had indeed been injured.</p><p>However, because it had been an emergency, Zhong Yuanzi used the demi-saint’s blood that spurted out of his body and injected all his power into it.</p><p>After it was divided between Greedy the Cat Spirit and himself, before being digested, it quickly evolved, reintegrated and completed the rebirth in a different way? It was much like how a ‘gecko cut off its tail’?</p><p>“How do we kill such a person?”</p><p>The second true body finally realized just how terrifying a demi-saint all-attribute Spiritual Cultivator was.</p><p>If he couldn’t exterminate this guy’s spirit, body, and will in an instant, he wouldn’t even need to use the demi-saint Incarnation. His existence was equivalent to half an Immortal Body!</p><p>And to be able to destroy Zhong Yuanzi in one move…</p><p>Who in the world had such confidence?</p><p>He even had to rely on Abyss Island when it came to Yan Wuse’s death. The battle lines had to be dragged and it had to be grounded dry, a little at a time.</p><p>It was only when Yan Wuse didn’t want to live anymore that he could be killed!</p><p>Therefore, to kill this person, he had to replicate the situation at Abyss Island at the Southern Zone gate and exhaust Zhong Yuanzi bit by bit?</p><p>He quickly scoffed at this ridiculous delusion.</p><p>He changed his method and looked at Zhong Yuanzi, who was still not hostile towards him, with a hint of curiosity on his face.</p><p>“Senior Zhong is amazing!”</p><p>“This Junior merely made a minor attempt. I didn’t expect Senior to really be able to block my attack… By the way, what was your earlier question?”</p><p>The people outside the arena were immediately stunned by this about-face.</p><p>He couldn’t beat him, so he started to get close to him?</p><p>Even Ye Xiaotian and Mei Siren were flabbergasted and could not react to Xu Xiaoshou’s sudden change in attitude.</p><p>“Bind!”</p><p>Only Fang Wenxin moved extremely quickly.</p><p>After he recaptured Greedy the Cat Spirit who was recovering from its injuries, he looked at Zhong Yuanzi and said.</p><p>“Elder Zhong, get back here!”</p><p>“We can interrogate this person after we capture him.”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi was instantly unhappy. He waved his hand and said, “Wait a minute!”</p><p>He looked back at this imaginative young man. He ignored what had just happened and asked, “Tell me frankly. Did you comprehend it or were you taught by someone?”</p><p>As he spoke, Zhong Yuanzi spun on his feet and stepped out of an extremely dim body that was way inferior to his second true body…</p><p>“Fire-type Great Dao Disc!”</p><p>“Ox devil…”</p><p>When he saw this the second true body almost split apart.</p><p>How did he do it?</p><p>He also had a system?</p><p>This was impossible!</p><p>The battle at the Southern Zone gate seemed to have been paused.</p><p>The spectators’ eyes bulged out of their sockets, and Ye Xiaotian was dumbfounded. Even Zhong Yuanzi’s companions…</p><p>Fang Wenxin and Elder Yu were also surprised. They stared dazedly at Xu Xiaoshou’s Power Upanishad Formation under Zhong Yuanzi’s feet.</p><p>At this moment, everyone was certain of one thing:</p><p>Both Zhong Yuanzi and Xu Xiaoshou’s Power Upanishad Formations were not Power Upanishad Formations at all, but were the embryonic forms of the Power Upanishad Formation.</p><p>Embryonic form!</p><p>This was the key!</p><p>But the problem here was…</p><p>Before Xu Xiaoshou and Zhong Yuanzi, no one else on the continent had ever displayed such an ability.</p><p>This d*mned ‘researcher’ kept it hidden?</p><p>If he had not been forced into a corner, the Sacred Mountain might not even be aware that Elder Zhong knew this trick till ten years later.</p><p>Fang Wenxin had more thoughts than the others.</p><p>He knew that this meant that a new path had opened up in the Spiritual Cultivation world!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
