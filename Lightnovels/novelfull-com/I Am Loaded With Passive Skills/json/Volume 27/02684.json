It could have been 0.5 or 0.7…</p><p>It could grow!</p><p>Even he temporarily suppressed the urge to attack.</p><p>Compared to a single ghost beast, the change in the overall situation of the Spiritual Cultivation world seemed to be more important?</p><p>It was almost like the War of the Ten High Nobles back then, when Kui Leihan had just comprehended the Penetrating Divine Senses and no one had thought highly of him.</p><p>At that time, no one took it seriously.</p><p>Things were different now.</p><p>The world now had a different outlook when it came to geniuses and realized that one person could really change the world.</p><p>From Elder Zhong’s reaction, this was clearly a matter that was of utmost importance. Whoever came would have to queue behind him!</p><p>Fang Wenxin glanced at Greedy the Cat Spirit and restrained himself.</p><p>In the middle of the battle, Zhong Yuanzi kept clapping his hands and circled around the young man. Not only did he look excited, but he also muttered continuously.</p><p>“I’ve studied it for hundreds of years!”</p><p>“I’ve always believed that nothing can be accomplished overnight.”</p><p>“In other words, as Spiritual Cultivators, we don’t even know how far we’ve progressed from zero to one.”</p><p>“This must be a ‘mistake’!”</p><p>“The Spiritual Cultivator was not at fault, nor was it the path of Spiritual Cultivation. It’s because no one had discovered this secret yet. Am I right, young friend?”</p><p>“Ah, right, right, right!” The second true body nodded in agreement. He could see this person’s character clearly now-he was really a researcher!</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi put his hand on the young man’s shoulder again and his palm bled without him realizing it.</p><p>This time, the second true body didn’t dare to resist. It trembled and shouted out the true name of the main body in its heart.</p><p>“You have Water Ghost who is part of your Saint Servant. He was previously Yu Mo of our Spirit Division. I did this experiment with him.”</p><p>“He told me that it was impossible. He did not know how far away he was from the Water-type Upanishad.”</p><p>I told him, “You should have a rough idea of your own path. Maybe 30%, maybe 70%. You should be able to come up with an estimate.”</p><p>“He said that he always felt that he was only one step away, but after he took this step, he felt that he was still half a step away. He could not reach it for a long time.”</p><p>After he said this, Zhong Yuanzi held down the young man who didn’t dare to move and looked at the white-haired Daoist child beside him.</p><p>“Do you feel the same way?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian wiped the sweat off his forehead and glanced at Xu Xiaoshou, who did not react at all. He raised his voice slightly and said.</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>What the hell!</p><p>So, what was the situation now?</p><p>Should he fight or not?</p><p>Should we fight the ghost beast, or do you want to save the ghost beast, or is your question more important?</p><p>If the question is important, do I have to answer honestly or not… Xu Xiaoshou, give me a signal!</p><p>The second true body really couldn’t give any signals at this moment.</p><p>He was very interested in Zhong Yuanzi’s research, and at the same time, he knew that the current situation was quite strange.</p><p>But he was very experienced.</p><p>This might seem weird, however which battle did not have a sudden change in plan?</p><p>If the horse could still run forward, then the situation was not bad. Our first principle is to not destroy this balance!</p><p>“He said ‘Yes’. Elder Zhong, are you awake?”</p><p>The second true body spoke up for Master Dean and patted Zhong Yuanzi, who had paused during the snowstorm, on the shoulder and then continued to speak.</p><p>It was unknown if it was due to any inspiration, but Zhong Yuanzi, who had been out for more than ten breaths of time, seemed to have restarted his brain after being stimulated. The change was very abrupt.</p><p>“I call it the Great Path Diagram. It’s an ‘intermediate process’ that is below the Power Upanishad Formation and above the Innate Stage attribute.”</p><p>“Because it’s still under research, I didn’t show it before, so the Holy Divine Palace is not aware either… I feel that they will ruin my personal research. Hmm, I feel…”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi crouched down and pointed at the fire-type Great Path Diagram that spun slowly beneath his feet. It was as if he was giving a lecture to the Spiritual Cultivators who crouched on the city wall and on the distant mountain and watched the scene unfold.</p><p>“The Master Stage touched the Dao, and the Sovereign Stage gained Enlightenment.”</p><p>“The complexity and brilliance of the Great Path Diagram is a reflection of how much our Spiritual Cultivators have gained enlightenment in the Way of the Heavens.”</p><p>“Take myself as an example. I’m not too interested in the fire-type. I’ve only comprehended about 7 to 8 percent of it. At most, it’s not even 10 percent. The main direction of my exploration is temperature and Yin and Yang. I’m more interested in the coldness of fire…”</p><p>“Hmm, that’s going off the topic. Let’s put it this way. There’s a limit to a person’s energy in their lifetime. Even if they have all the attributes, they still have to make a choice…”</p><p>Unknowingly, the people on the mountain and the city wall crept nearer and nearer.</p><p>Even if Zhong Yuanzi had mentioned only a little of the knowledge about the elements and the direction of exploration, it would be a supreme treasure to outsiders.</p><p>Some people had already begun to fluctuate with the path energy. They had clearly entered a state of epiphany.</p><p>The demi-saint preached the Dao, and the Elemental Divine Envoy started the class!</p><p>To most people, this opportunity was even rarer than the birth of the Ran Ming ruins.</p><p>After all, there was still a life and death crisis in the ruins, and Zhong Yuanzi was a gentle soul. Now, he provided immortal guidance!</p><p>Fang Wenxin and Elder Yu couldn’t help themselves and moved closer.</p><p>They were both Spiritual Cultivators so they both valued this elemental book.</p><p>Even Mei Siren and Ye Xiaotian followed suit. Just like the other Spiritual Cultivators, they began to study the so-called ‘Great Path Diagram’ beneath Zhong Yuanzi’s feet.</p><p>The scene suddenly became harmonious.</p><p>“Show me yours.”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi suddenly pointed at the white-haired Dao child, as if he called on an important study representative in class.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s mind went blank. He raised his head and looked at Fang Wenxin, who was a few steps away from him. His heart nearly jumped out of his throat.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
