However, the word ‘prisoner’ was written across his clothes.</p><p>Gou Wuyue had stood here for a long time.</p><p>Ever since the time when Dao Qiongcang came, he could no longer contact his people from the outside world or receive any information.</p><p>Some people thought he left due to his sanctification.</p><p>Some people thought that he had been secretly killed.</p><p>Only Gou Wuyue knew that he was here to cultivate and also to wait for the next meeting.</p><p>When the soft sound of flowing water came from afar, Gou Wuyue looked back and saw a man with long hair, clad only in a loose robe and had a grave look on his face.</p><p>He felt dazed for a moment…</p><p>This guy looks so plain, the first time I saw him was in the presence of the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had become Hallmaster Dao after being one of the Ten High Nobles, which meant that Dao Qiongcang had disappeared.</p><p>“The main body?” Gou Wuyue said, slightly surprised.</p><p>“The demi-saint only had three incarnations left. One of them was captured during my term as Hallmaster, and the other was cursed to death outside…”</p><p>“As for the remaining one, in order to live up to its name of ‘Unpredictable’, it must never be seen by anyone.”</p><p>“The only one who can come to see you can only be my main body.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang who was dressed in loose clothing, smiled and conjured up a semi-saint person. “Of course, this also represents my sincerity.”</p><p>The Dead Sea fell silent.</p><p>By comparison, the current Gou Wuyue seemed to have experienced many vicissitudes of life.</p><p>He was dressed plainly and had long hair that reached his waist and was extremely wet. There was even stubble on his lips.</p><p>He didn’t look at the semi-saint person. He looked behind Dao Qiongcang and chuckled. “I vaguely heard a scream.”</p><p>“Then you’ve improved again. Even the rules can’t restrain you.” Dao Qiongcang turned his head as well, his eyes filled with memories. After he laughed, he sighed and said.</p><p>“After I slept in the Sacred Mountain for more than thirty years, my image has changed from that of a cunning villain to a gentle and refined person.”</p><p>“I was very surprised that one day, I can be associated with the word ‘kind’.”</p><p>Gou Wuyue shook his head.</p><p>Kind?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang could be said to be unpredictable and as cunning as a fox.</p><p>However, other than the You Yuan Buddha, which of the the Ten High Nobles had ever been associated with kindness? Anyone who had anything to do with that trait would have been swallowed by the world long ago!</p><p>“Your main body had already been forced out and Bazhun’an had already killed his way up the Sacred Mountain?” Gou Wuyue rejected the offer of the semi-saint person.</p><p>“No.” Dao Qiongcang took it back.</p><p>“Then, who could force you to take this step?”</p><p>“No one can.”</p><p>Gou Wuyue was stunned when he heard this. He felt the wound on his arm throb a little.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang smiled. “If there’s a change in the plan, we can only proceed with the second plan. If it still doesn’t work, there’s still the third…”</p><p>“Just say it!” Gou Wuyue was too lazy to argue with this person.</p><p>“The Holy Divine Palace was sick to the core, and is in a total mess. I chose to make use of a loophole and was prematurely eliminated. Coincidentally, my sister was only too happy to take over.”</p><p>“Oh?” Gou Wuyue was slightly surprised and said,”Xuanji… must be a ruthless person!”</p><p>“I took the initiative to avenge you for the hurt caused by the Judicial Division. The scream you heard earlier was from the one who cut off your arm.” Dao Qiongcang said.</p><p>“There’s no need to do that.” Gou Wuyue smiled. He didn’t care at all.</p><p>“It was necessary, because he also happened to offend me. Although this was just incidental, I mainly want to help you take revenge.”</p><p>“Yes, you can think of it as a repayment from me…”</p><p>“If you have something to say, just say it.”</p><p>“Good! You’re very straightforward! I like that very much! Old Gou, did you think I kicked you when you’re down that day? The Judicial Division wanted to target you, but I stated your case very objectively. I even pleaded for you…”</p><p>“Get to the point.”</p><p>“As you can see, I’m ambitious, and so are you. You don’t even care about the semi-saint person… And this time, I came only to see you when I woke up. This is enough to show my respect…”</p><p>“And your point is ….?!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang seemed unable to express all his emotions and was a little depressed.</p><p>He could only spread his hands and chose to get straight to the point.</p><p>“Come with me, let’s go to the Southern Region!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
