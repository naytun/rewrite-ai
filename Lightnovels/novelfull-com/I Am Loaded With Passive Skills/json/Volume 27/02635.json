In the Four Symbols Secret Realm, as long as I cooperated with Bei Huai, you wouldn’t have been able to escape.”</p><p>“But that oblivion technique is really something else.”</p><p>“I almost closed the net at that time, but I knew that by doing so, you would probably slip through the net.”</p><p>“Because even if you die, I will not die. In time, there will be a great disaster.”</p><p>“And now…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang stroked the head of the array wheel and sighed.</p><p>As tenacious as Xu Xiaoshou was, as time went by, he was only left with the head of a array wheel. He sighed as he said.</p><p>“I really like the oblivion technique”</p><p>“If possible, I have another suggestion. If you teach it to me, I will let you live. How about it?”</p><p>He knew the head of the array wheel could not speak, so Dao Qiongcang continued.</p><p>“This is a suggestion. It can take effect anytime and anywhere.”</p><p>“When you are able to answer this question, when we meet again, you can use this in exchange for a way out. Do you understand?”</p><p>Jin Ren heard what he said.</p><p>However, he could not teach him the Independence technique.</p><p>Even if he could turn it into a spiritual technique and teach it to others, he would definitely not teach it to Elder Dao the Flamboyant.</p><p>Dream on!</p><p>However he could not say this out loud.</p><p>“It’s not a problem. It’s not important. It’s fine as long as you heard it…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang stroked the head of the array wheel again and threw it out so Mei Siren would not attack and hurt him.</p><p>He had basically achieved his goal.</p><p>He didn’t need to hang on to Xu Xiaoshou to say the rest.</p><p>Mei Siren took back the array wheel. His eyes were a little wet, and his killing intent had also subsided.</p><p>He cradled it like a treasure as he wiped the dirt off the head of the array wheel and apologized.</p><p>“Sorry, sorry…”</p><p>He didn’t protect the array wheel well.</p><p>He didn’t crush the array wheel in time.</p><p>At the final moment, before the remnant thought faded away in the array wheel, he did not have the strength to save it!</p><p>Mei Siren was filled with guilt.</p><p>He knew that it was all his fault.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shouldn’t have met Dao Qiongcang at this age. He was still too late…</p><p>He was even too conceited!</p><p>Jin Ren wanted to utter some words of comfort, but he couldn’t.</p><p>The chaos and clamor in the Chaotic Spiritual Sky suddenly became orderly and quiet. There was only Cao Erzhu’s naive and incongruous exhortations in the distance.</p><p>“Father, have some tea. You drank too much wine…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang retreated.</p><p>The battle was over, and he would move on to the next step.</p><p>Although the teacher-student relationship in front of him was indeed a little touching, there would definitely be some bloodshed in the Struggle for the Great Path. This was what Xu Xiaoshou had said.</p><p>Similarly, this would be the most severe lesson he would teach Xu Xiaoshou in his lifetime.</p><p>If you can’t even pass this test…</p><p>How could he pass the Holy Emperor stage?</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The figure in the void exploded.</p><p>The gravity of the Chaotic Spiritual Sky returned, the starlight of the Spiritual Protection Sky was removed, and the ancient bronze door in the sky disappeared…</p><p>The mountain reverted to its original state.</p><p>When Cao Erzhu regained his senses, Mei Siren still clasped the head of the array wheel tightly to his body.</p><p>It was as if nothing had happened before. Only a solemn voice floated from the Nine Heavens.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, listen up!”</p><p>“During the battle on Abyss Island, I had already predicted that there could only be one of your incarnations…”</p><p>“I gave you the Collection of Excuses. It is your incarnation that is locked in this body.”</p><p>“The existence of the oblivion technique made me hold back. After this chess game, I will cut off all of your vitality!”</p><p>“If your incarnation chooses to self-destruct, only your original body will be left. If you kill it, you will never be able to be resurrected.”</p><p>“If your incarnation doesn’t dare to self-destruct, then all your secrets will be handed over to me. I will take charge of them.”</p><p>“I have predicted everything that you can think of, but you don’t know what I have kept hidden.”</p><p>“From your oblivion technique in the Four Symbols Secret Realm, from the time you were weakened after you fought with the Holy Emperor Qilin, from your clone to your main body… Everything can be calculated.”</p><p>“I can do it, but so can others!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu raised his tear filled eyes and looked up at the sky. Those illusory voices that he could not hear entered his ears.</p><p>He finally realized that his father had left. What he had just experienced was nothing more than a dream.</p><p>In the dream, he had encountered too many flaws, but he was unwilling to wake up because he did not dare to.</p><p>And now…</p><p>Brother Shou’s spiritual senses were so weak when he woke up from the dream.</p><p>Elder Dao the Flamboyant won?</p><p>“I was wrong…”</p><p>Cao Erzhu lowered his head and clenched his fists. There was annoyance and determination in his eyes.</p><p>The ethereal voice in the sky continued to speak.</p><p>“You exposed too many flaws, and I could easily see through them.”</p><p>“If you intend to ascend the Sacred Mountain in this manner, my suggestion is…”</p><p>“Pack up as soon as possible and go back to the First Pavilion in the Sky and get a good night’s sleep.”</p><p>Unfortunately for Jin Ren, after the life supply of Qingyuan Mountain great array dissipated, his remnant thought began to disintegrate rapidly.</p><p>In his mind were the last remaining words from Dao Qiongcang that were filled with mockery.</p><p>“Qingyuan Mountain’s value is not due to the great array, but due to the fengshui of the place.”</p><p>“To deal with you, I don’t even need the great array. This is just the best burial place I’ve found for you and the best place for Master Siren to watch the ceremony. That’s all.”</p><p>“Right now, what can determine whether you can go back to your First Pavilion in the Sky and fulfill your dream of ‘ending the mistakes and rewriting the future’ is whether you can wake up or not!”</p><p>With a boom, all the restrictions of the Qingyuan Mountain great array were lifted.</p><p>The sun’s rays beat down as it rose high in the sky. The black shadow outlined in the sky held his divine Sinan in one hand and a jade talisman in the other.</p><p>The Apricot Realm jade talisman!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked down at the panoramic view of Qingyuan. It was really an opulent area that had excellent feng shui.</p><p>He sighed and his eyes turned extremely determined as he muttered to himself.</p><p>“I will not show any mercy…”</p><p>“If I hold back, when the time comes, will I have to beg those people to hold back for you?”</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang crushed the jade talisman that led to the Apricot Realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
