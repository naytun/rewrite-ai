He’s even weaker than a chicken under the seal of the Dead Sea. I can crush him to death with one hand, and you still want to talk about the Higher Void World… Ha, funny.”</p><p>“You!” Elder Sang trembled with anger, but he could only calm down and tried to explain. “I’m at the Ran Ming ruins now!”</p><p>“Oh?” Xu Xiaoshou was initially surprised, but then he nodded as he realized something. “Good excuse. Indeed, we can make a move once we enter the ruins of the god slayer. But if you think you can use this method to make me recite the actual name of the god slayer…”</p><p>After a pause, Xu Xiaoshou gave a thumbs up to the figure who came from afar. He flipped his head downward and said, “You’re really feeble!”</p><p>“Feeble?” Elder Sang couldn’t tell what he meant, but he could see the disdain and ridicule on this traitorous disciple’s face. He almost rushed over and wanted to attack again.</p><p>However, he had a good temperament and endured it.</p><p>“You met Elder Dao the Flamboyant?” Elder Sang asked.</p><p>This could explain why Xu Xiaoshou was so vigilant.</p><p>Forget it, forgive him…</p><p>“Heh…” Xu Xiaoshou sneered. “You could not catch me at the Apricot Realm and you made Greedy the Cat Spirit go crazy. Now, you want to use such a trick to capture my will? Tsk tsk, you’re really something, Elder Dao the Flamboyant!”</p><p>Elder Sang looked silently at his repulsive traitorous disciple and did not want to go through any more meaningless struggles.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou was adamant that he was Dao Qiongcang, any explanation would be useless.</p><p>“Bind!”</p><p>He frowned, and the Higher Void World suddenly paused. Xu Xiaoshou felt that he was frozen in place.</p><p>Elder Sang didn’t approach him. He simply flicked out two Infernal Fire Seeds.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The sound of the wind that whistled by could be heard and Xu Xiaoshou’s body shook. After he broke free, he leaned down.</p><p>As expected, the two Fire Seeds descended and shot into Xu Xiaoshou’s nostrils.</p><p>“F*ck…Puff! Cough cough! You…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou spluttered and coughed repeatedly. He held his mouth and coughed out a Fire Seed. Then he expelled the bigger one that was stuck in his mouth through his nose.</p><p>Just as he was about to flare up, he held the two Infernal Fire Seeds in his hands, and Xu Xiaoshou suddenly had a dazed look.</p><p>On the third level of the Spiritual Library Division at the Tiansang Spirit Palace, when he had just started his conducting alchemy, hadn’t he done this to him?</p><p>This memory could only be known to the two of them, because Elder Sang still pretended to be calm at that time. How could this matter be made known and spread out everywhere?</p><p>So…</p><p>“Elder Sang?” Xu Xiaoshou looked up in shock.</p><p>“Humph!” Elder Sang walked over calmly with his hands behind his back, but he was still on high alert.</p><p>This kid had an endless stream of tricks up his sleeves. Who knew if he had really remembered or just pretended to act dumb again?</p><p>“Impossible. That straw hat had long been shattered. How could I still enter your Higher Void World?” Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>“Black Flame God.” Elder Sang said indifferently, even as he kept a safe distance from his traitorous disciple and stared at him coldly.</p><p>Black Flame God…</p><p>What was that?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought for a while before he recalled that Elder Sang had given him three things the last time he entered the Higher Void World.</p><p>One was the virtual image, the second was the Saint Statue and the third was the large bottle of Holy Blood.</p><p>The virtual image came from himself. At that time, he had decided on a name and called it the Black Flame God.</p><p>“What about your virtual image?” Xu Xiaoshou asked uncertainly.</p><p>“Have you forgotten?” Elder Sang suddenly understood something.</p><p>“Ah, no, I didn’t forget. I just…”</p><p>“If you’d forgotten about it, then so be it. Stop talking nonsense.”</p><p>Elder Sang waved his hand ruthlessly to interrupt him. He walked around Xu Xiaoshou a few times and his expression was cold. “You haven’t used my virtual image before. Is that why you only saw me now?”</p><p>Was this virtual image another trump card left behind by Elder Sang for himself?</p><p>When he encountered a situation like the last time when he was controlled by something strange, or when he was unconscious like the present, he could use it to break through?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face turned ashen. “I have never used it before. I’m only fighting demi-saints and Holy Emperors now. The Saint Statue’s level is not even high enough. Why would I use the virtual… Eh?”</p><p>When he saw Elder Sang’s face turn purple, he hurriedly stopped.</p><p>“You deserve to be punished!” Elder Sang couldn’t take it anymore and wanted to hit him again.</p><p>This time Xu Xiaoshou did not dodge. He bared his teeth and covered his face with his hands. It was as if he knew that he was in the wrong and wanted to take a hit to make up for it. “Just don’t hit my face!”</p><p>For the third time, the Sleeveless red scorched hand stopped when it reached his head.</p><p>“Forget it…” Elder Sang let out a long sigh. He did not want to talk about the past anymore. “What predicament did you encounter this time?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou slowly lowered his hands and felt a lump in his throat for no reason. “That Elder Dao the Flamboyant is so disgusting. This dog thief had been at it… from the Four Symbols Secret Realm, he already…”</p><p>Once the dam broke, the desire to pour out all his sorrows could not be stopped.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never had this chance to complain so much to someone else.</p><p>He went from the Four Symbols Secret Realm to the Holy Emperor Qilin, to Bei Huai The Divine, to the Divine Secrets Array outside Jade Capital City, to Changde Town’s Qingyuan Mountain…</p><p>Even his clone Jin Ren had detonated and he had almost been possessed in the Apricot Realm. Then, he had managed to turn the tables and narrowly escaped death. He vividly described his survival ingenuity.</p><p>Unknowingly, the two of them chatted on and on.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s spit flew everywhere. Elder Sang smiled as he watched and listened to him rant to his heart’s content. His heart ached a little.</p><p>When the toothache started to flare up, the heartache disappeared.</p><p>“Elder Dao the Flamboyant is really disgusting. However, Bazhun’an was equally vile. He was the second dog thief…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou then told him about how Bazhun’an had not done anything to help and let him face Dao Qiongcang alone.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
