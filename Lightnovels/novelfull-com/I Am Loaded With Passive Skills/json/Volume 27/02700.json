The Southern Region should have been cleared long ago. Hallmaster Xuanji was truly bold!</p><p>“Clear Southern Region, the True Heaven!”</p><p>“Clear Southern Region, the True Heaven!”</p><p>“Clear Southern Region, the True Heaven!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The sound waves were higher and higher.</p><p>The forces of Jade Capital City rallied, invading the mountains and rivers.</p><p>With the help of the Xuanji great array, the sound waves even surged out of the city.</p><p>“This crazy woman…”</p><p>High up in the sky, Ye Xiaotian’s expression changed drastically, and his curses stuck in his throat.</p><p>He suddenly realized that everything was a trap.</p><p>That woman had planned this all along. From the beginning, her ambition did not stop at Greedy the Cat Spirit, but rather the entire Southern Region!</p><p>From when she became Hallmaster of the Sacred Mountain to where she stood, each action had been taken after careful deliberation, one step at a time.</p><p>From the Sacred Mountain, she had snowballed, gaining momentum as she marched upon Jade Capital City. Did she hope to take advantage of the situation and make a push for the Southern Region?</p><p>Only a crazy woman with even crazier methods would harbor such ambition that it ran as deep as still water. In some ways, she was even scarier than her brother, Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>“Clear Southern Region, Zhengcangtian, Hallmaster Xuanji, Infinite Arts!”</p><p>“Clear Southern Region, Zhengcangtian, Hallmaster Xuanji, Infinite Arts!”</p><p>“… Hallmaster Xuanji!”</p><p>“… Hallmaster Xuanji!”</p><p>At the Southern City gate, Yu Zhiwen stared blankly at the sky. The sound waves in the city had left her dazed.</p><p>Had she actually seen a smile on her master’s face?</p><p>How could her Supreme Master, whose expression had remained unchanged for decades, actually smile?</p><p>In it, she seemed to sense, ever so faintly, an impatient yearning for true glory.</p><p>“Is this what you want?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen stopped. She did not know if it was appropriate for her to raise such a question under these circumstances.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The winds howled, and the snow came pelting down relentlessly.</p><p>The golden laurels lining the path trembled in the arctic blizzard.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen thought she had sensed something and turned around in surprise.</p><p>“Sword Will?”</p><p>Mei Siren held Cao Erzhu some distance away, who could barely suppress his anger.</p><p>He looked to the north in disbelief.</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>Cao Erzhu struggled momentarily, only to realize that the old immortal was not restraining him anymore.</p><p>“Let’s go back.”</p><p>The old immortal held himself with dignity as he strolled towards the city where that evil witch was.</p><p>“That’s not good, right?” Cao Erzhu panicked. He was deathly afraid of that witch. He had only had the courage earlier because he knew the old immortal was restraining him, preventing him from acting rashly.</p><p>Now that he had calmed down, was the old immortal getting carried away?</p><p>“I have no choice but to go back!”</p><p>Mei Siren did not care. He grabbed the burly youth with one hand and quickly chased the soaring sword intent.</p><p>Weng Weng!</p><p>Meanwhile, in Jade Capital City, amidst the cheers of the crowd, osmanthus trees swayed in unison, though seemingly unaffected by the sound waves produced.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Someone stopped when the spirit sword, worn as an accessory at his waist, suddenly flew into the sky.</p><p>Weng Weng Weng!</p><p>The sword hummed loudly, refusing to be contained any longer.</p><p>The crowd’s cheers died as they saw the flying spirit swords amid the raging snowstorm.</p><p>Osmanthus flowers and snow danced high up in the air.</p><p>Sword Will and Force erupted.</p><p>“How grand!”</p><p>Suddenly, an ancient dragon sporting apricot patterns appeared in the sky, roaring like a roll of thunder.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Dao Xuanji frowned as her attention was drawn to the spectacle.</p><p>All the Saints looked up in surprise.</p><p>The Ancestral Tree Diagram rose to meet the challenge, filling Jade Capital City with vitality and bringing greenery to the desolate snow.</p><p>From the ashes of battle and the wreckage of war, young seedlings sprout, turning into golden apricot trees that weathered the snow and sleet.</p><p>Golden osmanthus, golden apricot…</p><p>Within Jade Capital City, she could stand on equal footing with almost anyone.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Greedy, the Cat Spirit suddenly raised its head, flipped its nine tails, swallowed the power of the forbidden Path Princples, and rose into the air.</p><p>Just as Dao Xuanji was about to make her move, a black shadow covered the Nine Heavens.</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>It was a black sword. A demonic aura filled the sky above Jade Capital City as it stabbed the Xuanji great array.</p><p>“It’s the Fourth Sword!”</p><p>At the Southern Zone gate, Xi cried in surprise.</p><p>It was not over yet!</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>Another sword wreathed in white flames pierced through the sky and nailed itself in the Xuanji great array.</p><p>Puff! Puff!</p><p>White flames rose in all directions, devouring the demonic aura emitted by the Fourth Sword. The black corruption around the Xuanji great array gave way to a pale white, reminiscent of the Eight Trigrams.</p><p>“Flame Python!”</p><p>Xi exclaimed once more.</p><p>One might have been a mistake, but two indicated a plan.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen took to the skies, observing the surroundings with her Pearl Gem Star Eyes as if looking for something.</p><p>“Sob–”</p><p>Another strange, high-pitched sword cry descended upon them like a meteorite.</p><p>A black-robed young man with long hair flew over on his sword.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Greedy, the Cat Spirit suddenly opened his huge mouth. His scarlet eyes were still filled with an evil light, yet his canines retracted as he calmed down.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Golden light exploded in the Nine Heavens.</p><p>Amidst the resplendent light, a dragon’s roar shocked the world.</p><p>Berserk Giant’s fist rocked backward, while Greedy the Cat spirit howled as he threw up blood, spattering all over the Xuanji great array.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Golden Giant punched Greedy the Cat Spirit, who was trying to devour its master. It stomped on Greedy again for good measure.</p><p>Then, with a whoosh, he turned into a handsome young man.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s icy facade melted, and a smile adorned her features. Her mouth snapped shut just as she was about to speak up, and her lips drew a thin line instead.</p><p>The young man straddled the line between black and white, surrounded by ghostly energy. He embodied both good and evil, yet neither at the same time.</p><p>The Ancestral Tree Dragon Apricot bloomed in the sky, scattering golden petals that mottled his dark body with golden spots.</p><p>The corners of his lips curled up slightly as he stared coldly at the face of the old woman whom he had never met before but who made him feel annoyed at first glance.</p><p>“Yo, old hag, you have a way of making irresponsible remarks. You’re almost as good as me!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
