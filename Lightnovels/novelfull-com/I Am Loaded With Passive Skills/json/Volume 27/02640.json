It returned to Diagram form and merged with the world.</p><p>Dragon Apricot had only treated this form so seriously when the little world of Yuan Mansion evolved into the Apricot Realm.</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit’s white fur stood up slightly. He felt an inexplicable fear, and even his claws trembled slightly.</p><p>It moved its chubby little body and stood in front of the alchemy cauldron and its unconscious owner.</p><p>“Refuse!”</p><p>An ancient voice sounded in the Apricot Realm.</p><p>In an instant, the power of the world was completely mobilized and emitted the strongest resistance…</p><p>It resisted the unknown!</p><p>Resisted the arrival of the disaster!</p><p>It even resisted the invasion of all unknown and known creatures at this moment!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Zhu Yike, who was struggling with the Apricot Realm’s energy movement with both hands, was ultimately unable to resist the power of the Ancestral Tree Dragon Apricot and was blasted away by the space-time debris.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>He let out a mournful and unwilling roar.</p><p>However, when his face shattered, what was left for the Spirit of Dragon Apricot was still his fake smile and respect.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!!!”</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot shouted the true name of the Master of the Apricot Realm, its voice carrying a hint of fear.</p><p>This was the unique “horror” that cunning humans could bring to other creatures in the world?</p><p>In any case, this was something that was difficult for other creatures to do. Even a failed smuggling was terrifying!</p><p>Humans indeed disgusted trees!</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot felt that it would be difficult to forget Zhu Yike’s smiling face for the next few hundred years.</p><p>However, its call did not wake Xu Xiaoshou up. The latter was still sleeping soundly and was still in a lost state.</p><p>The spirit of Dragon Apricot Tree had successfully rejected the smuggling of the Disaster Descender but was still a little worried.</p><p>It was afraid that the person would sneak in a second time, so it separated a strand of the saint’s will and circled around the Apricot Realm, constantly checking for any abnormalities in the surrounding spacetime fragments.</p><p>Not long after, the spirit of the Dragon Apricot saw two figures in the even more chaotic flow of time.</p><p>One was Zhu Yike.</p><p>The other was still Zhu Yike.</p><p>“Two Zhu Yike?”</p><p>The spirit of the Dragon Apricot widened its eyes.</p><p>The images projected by the time fragments were unstable and disorderly.</p><p>It did not follow the flow of time in the normal world. It could be reversed, disordered, or even simultaneous.</p><p>The spirit of Dragon Apricot thought that they were the same person and that they were just projected by the time fragment in the same image.</p><p>Soon, it realized that it was not because it saw the contents of the first scene.</p><p>On the other side, just as Zhu Yike was about to smuggle in, another Zhu Yike behind him actually shouted anxiously,</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“Senior Dragon Apricot, he’s fake!”</p><p>“He snatched my Apricot Realm jade talisman. Don’t let him in!”</p><p>The spirit of the Dragon Apricot Tree was extremely shocked. It realized that its intuition was right, and it had almost made a huge mistake.</p><p>The time fragment continued to fluctuate, projecting another related scene. The spirit of Dragon Apricot hurriedly checked it.</p><p>In the scene, Zhu Yike was trapped in a headless, big-bellied demon, and was rapidly moving toward the Dead Sea of the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>However, he secretly took out half of his clothes, and the aura of the Ancestor’s power emerged from his body.</p><p>The power of the ancestral source was above everything else.</p><p>The command token on his neck that controlled the fluctuation of spirit source seemed to have been temporarily deceived by the Golden Gate Technique.</p><p>Zhu Yike disappeared and escaped from the evil spirit’s belly. He appeared beside a young ancient swordsman.</p><p>Before the ancient swordsman could react, Zhu Yike smiled and took out a copper coin. He flicked it at his head and disappeared.</p><p>When he teleported away, he should have returned to the sea without any restraints, but he realized that there was another person in front of him…</p><p>It was Zhu Yike, who had a fake smile on his face!</p><p>The fake Zhu Yike knocked out the real Zhu Yike in one strike. He then took out an Apricot Realm jade talisman from his body.</p><p>Then, there was the scene just now.</p><p>And the scene of the real Zhu Yike waking up right after him and chasing after him to stop him.</p><p>“So that’s how it is…”</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot finally understood the entire situation.</p><p>However, before it could breathe a sigh of relief, the time fragments projected a scene that was happening at that time:</p><p>A fake Zhu Yike that failed to smuggle into the country found the real Zhu Yike.</p><p>He still had that fake smile on his face, but his words were extremely cold.</p><p>“The informant, die!”</p><p>Without any hesitation, the fake Zhu Yike stretched out his jade-white flawless hand and smashed it fiercely toward the real Zhu Yike’s head.</p><p>The latter was completely powerless to resist, leaving only despair.</p><p>At this moment, the Spirit of Dragon Apricot, who had witnessed this scene with its own eyes, fell into a dilemma…</p><p>Save?</p><p>Or not to save?</p><p>It saw the scene of the time fragment in progress, and it was also present in the spatial fragment. This meant that the scene was not in the past but in the present!</p><p>In reality, not only those who possessed the Apricot Realm jade talisman could be guided into the Apricot Realm.</p><p>As the World Tree, the spirit of the Dragon Apricot could save the real Zhu Yike from the abyss of suffering with just a Nian.</p><p>But…</p><p>Was it worth it to break the rule that only those who held the Apricot Realm jade talisman could enter the Apricot Realm for such an insignificant person?</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou was the person about to die, the Spirit of Dragon Apricot would definitely save him.</p><p>However, Zhu Yike was only the number one figure under Little Shou Xu.</p><p>Without him, there would be another Zhu Yike.</p><p>Just like that Li Fugui. Although he was good-looking, there were still people who could replace him even if he was gone.</p><p>“I am a noble ancestral tree, how can I be compassionate and break the Apricot Realm’s rules?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
