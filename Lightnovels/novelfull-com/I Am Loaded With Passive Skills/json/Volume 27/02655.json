In the blink of an eye, it was back!</p><p>At that moment, Ye Xiaotian had already declared proudly, “Who’s coming with me?”</p><p>“Me!” Cao Erzhu was the first to raise his hand.</p><p>“I will go too.” Mei Siren followed knowingly. Ye Xiaotian had already locked onto the space node of Xu Xiaoshou’s pocket dimension.</p><p>Despite requiring Yu Zhiwen to spend a lot of elixirs and energy, finding a place was a basic skill for a Spatial Upanishad.</p><p>“What about you?” Ye Xiaotian looked at the Five Decays of Heaven and Man with an unfriendly gaze.</p><p>He knew what the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had done to Yu Zhiwen at that time.</p><p>Fortunately, he only asked a few unimportant questions and there was no follow-up. Or rather, any follow-up was interrupted by Master Siren.</p><p>“He’s here…” the Five Decays of Heaven and Man looked into the void and continued to mutter silently to himself, as if he was not looking at Ye Xiaotian but at something else.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian did not say another word.</p><p>With his current cultivation level, Ye Xiaotian could simply order him to wherever. Ye Xiaotian could either get the Five Decays of Heaven and Man to tag along, or send the Five Decays of Heaven and Man to the Southern Region, and it would be long before the Five Decays of Heaven and Man could return to Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>If all else failed, Ye Xiaotian could simply be rough like Xu Xiaoshou and split the group in half.</p><p>“Spatial teleportation.” Ye Xiaotian spoke in a simple and unadorned manner, and a magnificent, dazzling, and extremely stable spatial passageway descended before him.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was silent.</p><p>Compared to the current passageway, the erratic spatial passageway she had constructed before was way more simple and crude, worse than a single-plank bridge.</p><p>No wonder Mr. Siren and the others were blown aside.</p><p>“Let’s go.” Ye Xiaotian was the first to step into the spatial passageway.</p><p>After he moved, the three people on Qingyuan Mountain twisted the space under their feet and fell into the passageway at the same time.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>In just an instant, that terrifying explosion sounded again.</p><p>A white-haired Daoist child flew out from the void. His clothes were slightly messy, and his face was filled with fear.</p><p>“What the hell is this?”</p><p>“Even I can’t enter?”</p><p>Mei Siren, Cao Erzhu, and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had been a step slower.</p><p>When Ye Xiaotian was blasted away, the Holy Power was cut off, and they returned to their original positions to witness the flying Daoist child.</p><p>Mei Siren’s pupils contracted slightly. Mei Siren frowned as he looked back at the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. The latter’s answer just now flashed across his mind.</p><p>Ghost beast…</p><p>“What did you mean?” Mei Siren asked directly.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man remained silent, but at that moment, he raised his hand slightly and pointed at the sky.</p><p>Everyone looked over and saw that a crack had appeared in the sky.</p><p>The crack stretched from the west to the east and was so deep that one could not see the bottom. It was so big that it blocked off the sunlight and covered the entire Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>“Crack.”</p><p>With the large crack as the foundation, countless small cracks began to rapidly spread.</p><p>In an instant, the sky cracked like an earthquake, opening up a spatial storm amidst the debris. It was simply a natural disaster.</p><p>“Boom, boom, boom…”</p><p>Countless spatial blades and storms poured down, slashing toward Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen subconsciously formed a hand seal.</p><p>The Qingyuan Mountain great array was activated immediately, protecting all living beings in the surroundings.</p><p>At that moment, other than Cao Erzhu, everyone present had already completely understood what kind of phenomenon this was.</p><p>“An extradimensional spatial crack!”</p><p>“Is it the birth of a ghost beast?”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Mei Siren looked at the magnificent scene in front of him in shock.</p><p>After living for so long, he had deliberately chosen to avoid as much trouble as possible, so it was the first time he had seen the birth of a extradimensional spatial crack at such a close distance.</p><p>Nevertheless, including him, everyone knew that this was just the beginning. There would be ghost beasts coming from unknown places to the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>Judging from the size of the spatial crack and the strength of the force with which Mei Siren and Ye Xiaotian were sent flying, that ghost beast might be of a higher void level or even the Saint Stage.</p><p>“A ghost beast…”</p><p>“This is bad.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen bounced up from the ground reflexively and hurriedly took out a red communication bead and pressed it.</p><p>Having traveled from the Sacred Mountain to the Eastern Region, she had even entered the White Cave, an extradimensional space.</p><p>However, it was also the first time she had seen such a natural disaster.</p><p>In her memory, there had never been a extradimensional spatial crack in Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>That meant a newly formed connection with foreign land, and the descendence of ghost beasts.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen had to report the matter to the red-clothed people in time. It was something that could endanger the five regions.</p><p>Looking at the scale, it was probably comparable to the Infernal Hell Sea.</p><p>“How could there be such a coincidence?” Mei Siren still couldn’t believe it. Xu Xiaoshou was in trouble, and it just so happened that an extradimensional spatial crack had opened up there, and it was on such a large scale.</p><p>“Coincidence?” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man laughed when he heard that.</p><p>His creepy laughter quickly attracted the attention of a few people beside him.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, haven’t you always been bringing a ghost beast with you?” he asked in a mocking tone.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the void rift became larger, and a huge hole appeared in the sky.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
