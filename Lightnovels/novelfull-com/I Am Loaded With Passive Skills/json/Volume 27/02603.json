She helped to conceal your whereabouts many times. To withhold is to betray, did you not know?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“In the Four Symbols Secret Realm, during the incident at the Vermilion Bird’s Golden Tower, she discovered your movements. When questioned by me, she answered nothing. Everything concerning you is speculated upon but not reported. It’s all turning towards you, tantamount to treason. Did you not know? Or are you pretending to be ignorant?”</p><p>“…”.</p><p>“Not to mention later when you encountered Holy Emperor Bei, who was the first to risk her life to help you break free? If it wasn’t for me stopping her, she would be dead now!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Jin Ren was nearly overwhelmed by this barrage. Suddenly, he found a point to refute, “Holy Emperor Qilin and that person surnamed Bei, would they have come out if not for you?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang chuckled, “The one guarding the Vermilion Bird’s Golden Tower, if it weren’t Yu Zhiwen, but me, would you have had a chance for what followed?”</p><p>“… Yes!”</p><p>“Don’t change the subject. We’re discussing children now, not Qilin.” Dao Qiongcang’s eyes gleamed. “Oh, are you worried about issues regarding ‘Qilin’?”</p><p>What about Qilin?</p><p>Jin Ren’s mind was once again befuddled.</p><p>“Don’t worry. Little Yu might have a sacred physique, but isn’t the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer in your possession? Eat more Dragon Apricots and gain the power of the Dragon Ancestor…” Dao Qiongcang clapped his hands. “Dragons and fish, a match made in heaven!”</p><p>“…” Jin Ren was completely silent.</p><p>“Oh? Are you not interested in her? She’s a descendant of Kun Peng God’s bloodline. She has only revealed a glimpse of her Divine Secret, but that doesn’t mean there’s nothing else she can do. Do you know how powerful the Kun Peng bloodline is? How strong Elder Yu is?” Dao Qiongcang sneered, “If it were another descendant of the Holy Emperor, it would be another heap of trouble. The Kun Peng bloodline fits just right!”</p><p>“N-no, that’s not it…”</p><p>“Oh, are you worried about Elder Yu opposing this?” Anticipating the enemy’s moves, Dao Qiongcang continued unabated, “Leave Elder Yu to me! I often fish with him. I’ve praised you to him for so long; I’ve prepared plenty of bait for him.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Are you worried about her Supreme Master? Don’t worry, Xu Xiaoshou! That’s my sister. As long as I’m around, she couldn’t turn over in a day!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“What? Are you worried about me?” Dao Qiongcang chuckled to himself.</p><p>“I’m not like those from the Yue Clan, meddling in relationships and breaking up marriages.”</p><p>“If you two get along well, I wholeheartedly approve and will sit at the main table to celebrate your happiness.”</p><p>“Even if you want to leave the Saint Servant and forcefully join the Holy Divine Palace…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang paused, then laughed. “I’ve said it before, the doors of the Holy Divine Palace are always open to you. Come and go as you please. I’m very fond of you.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>In the ruins of Ran Ming, Jin Ren felt a hint of vitality reviving in his true form.</p><p>His spirits were stirring!</p><p>At the same time, his thoughts resonated, flashing through many scenes…</p><p>If he hadn’t joined the Saint Servant back then, hadn’t reluctantly accepted Bazhun’an’s half-coerced invitation, and hadn’t dealt with those subsequent troubles.</p><p>Instead, if he had agreed to be a Night Guardian, joined the red-clothed people, and joined the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>Would the outcome have been vastly different?</p><p>“Bazhun’an wasn’t as good to you as I am, right?” Dao Qiongcang jovially remarked, like the old matchmaker who loved to bring hearts together:</p><p>“If his child were a daughter, she would have been secretly born just over a decade ago. She might now be younger than you, barely reaching your age.”</p><p>“But he’d never marry his daughter to you. Just think about it, you troublemaker.”</p><p>“But I’m different!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang patted his chest, full of vigor:</p><p>“Who am I? The unpredictable Dao Qiongcang!”</p><p>“If you agree now, it’s a simple matter. I control fate and decide destiny.”</p><p>“You and Little Yu will definitely end up together. Even if the Holy Emperor comes, he can’t change the outcome, mark my words!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang leaned in, sighing deeply. “Do you trust that Bazhun’an will use Abyss Island to save you, or do you trust me?”</p><p>Jin Ren’s head was spinning.</p><p>His residual spiritual senses once again surveyed the blurry surroundings.</p><p>Was this really Qingyuan Mountain?</p><p>This wasn’t a dream!</p><p>Was Saint Servant and the Holy Divine Palace discussing such trivial matters during a night battle at Qingyuan?</p><p>If he woke Zhu Yike up to spread the word outside, no one would believe this!</p><p>“I…”</p><p>“Let’s not rush to refuse,” Dao Qiongcang said, waving his hand, “Think carefully about Little Yu and yourself. I’m not asking you to betray the Saint Servant, I just want you… to follow your heart.”</p><p>Jin Ren wanted to say that such monumental matters shouldn’t fall to his second true body.</p><p>He wasn’t the original, he couldn’t afford to think about such things.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang didn’t stop his frenzied behavior. After finishing his speech, he pulled out many portraits from his robe.</p><p>Without exception, they were all portraits of women, each with remarkable beauty.</p><p>Jin Ren scanned them with his spiritual senses and was astonished to recognize almost all of them.</p><p>Su Qianqian, Rao Yinyin, Mu Zixi, Mo Mo, Luo Leilei, Hong, Caramel, Lei Xi’er, Ah Yao…</p><p>From Xiaolian of the Plenty Gold Company to Aunt Xiang, even the fallen Rao Yaoyao, they were all among these portraits!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked through each portrait, then set them down one by one, leaving out the last one.</p><p>It depicted a woman with a hint of shyness, her fair skin glowing like jade, her starry eyes filled with wonder as if she saw beauty in everything in the world.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang held up the portrait, speaking earnestly to the Divine Puppet:</p><p>“You don’t know this yet, do you? The first time I practiced the Divine Secret in my life, I was on the roadside, arranging marital unions.”</p><p>“The results were accurate! Absolutely accurate!”</p><p>“Now, I’m revisiting old skills to determine marital connections for you. If others might have an eighty-eight percent compatibility with you…”</p><p>“Her!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang tapped the woman in the portrait, eyes gleaming as if he were pitching an exceptional product:</p><p>“Yu Zhiwen, one hundred percent!”</p><p>“Don’t wait until it’s too late to start imagining just how wonderful it would be if you could have her…”</p><p>Jin Ren was stunned.</p><p>He stared in disbelief at Dao Qiongcang, who seemed like an old prankster, nothing like the solemn Hallmaster Dao who governed the world.</p><p>He understood why, in that era, they called him… Elder Dao the Flamboyant!</p><p>Elder Dao the Flamboyant looked up at the sky, his eager expression instantly replaced by unparalleled seriousness.</p><p>“They’re here…”</p><p>He hastily put away dozens of female portraits, stood up, and spoke gravely:</p><p>“Alright, enough with the romance. It’s time we discuss the Struggle for the Great Path.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
