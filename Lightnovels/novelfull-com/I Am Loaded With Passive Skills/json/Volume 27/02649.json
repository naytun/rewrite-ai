He hadn’t seen it in the Apricot Realm. Such an important item should be placed in the small world, right?</p><p>He also recalled that Xu Xiaoshou had bought the roots of the Bodhi Ancient Wood at the Spirit Gem Trade Fair. Based on the evolution record of this small world, there was really a good chance that it would cultivate well, but he did not see it!</p><p>There were too many, too many…</p><p>Dao Qiongcang knew Xu Xiaoshou like the back of his hand. He had even studied what Elixirs formulas he knew and what Elixirs he could refine.</p><p>These details should have been taken into consideration when he first entered the Apricot Realm, but none of them were there.</p><p>Was it all because of the Blood World Pearl?</p><p>“It was all taken away…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang crushed the hilt of the broken sword in his hand and he had a smirk on his face.</p><p>He laughed at himself for being so stupid that he couldn’t even see through this.</p><p>He even laughed at himself that he had underestimated the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. He had clearly encountered similar guidance before, but he did not remedy it in time…</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>This, was considered as a guidance?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s pupils constricted. He wanted to inform his main body to do something, but he forgot that he was only a demi-saint’s incarnation.</p><p>He took a deep breath and looked back at Xu Xiaoshou who was soaking in the medicinal liquid in front of him. This was serious business!</p><p>Think about it…</p><p>If even the semi-saint person was gone…</p><p>How could Xu Xiaoshou’s true body be left for him?</p><p>“That’s right. He displayed a method to split his incarnation quickly on Abyss Island.”</p><p>“I’ve also studied it in depth and deduced that it’s a form of ‘rapid division’ rather than the ability to have ‘multiple incarnations at the same time’.”</p><p>“I thought that he was unconscious and that it was impossible for him to use this technique. I didn’t expect… No!”</p><p>When Dao Qiongcang thought of this, he laughed.</p><p>How could he be so naive that he did not even guard against this? Even if it was just a possibility, he had to be on his guard. That would be Dao Qiongcang’s style.</p><p>He could only say…</p><p>D*mn the Five Decays of Heaven and Man!</p><p>“You are Greedy the Cat Spirit from the Xu Yue Grey Palace?”</p><p>When all these thoughts flashed through Dao Qiongcang’s mind, he did not display any emotion. Instead, he looked hesitantly at the little white cat beside him.</p><p>He clearly remembered that if Xu Xiaoshou could still split his incarnation, then this incarnation’s consciousness should be able to awaken at any time.</p><p>He had to be wary of this!</p><p>“Meow…”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit rolled its eyes, nodded, and then shook its head.</p><p>It used to be, but now that its owner said that it was the First Pavilion in the Sky’s lucky cat, it was no longer that.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang ignored the Xu Xiaoshou in the alchemy cauldron. He squatted down and looked at Greedy the Cat Spirit with a smile.</p><p>“Do you know why Number Two went into its liberated state the moment he saw the Five Decays of Heaven and Man on Abyss Island?”</p><p>“Meow?” Greedy the Cat Spirit didn’t understand what he meant.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang stretched his hand as if he wanted to pat Greedy the Cat Spirit, but he stopped in mid-air and sighed.</p><p>“Because the Body of Devour is the first of the Five Extreme Physiques, and you are the Beast of Disaster. The variables are so great that you can destroy the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe and even the Shengshen Continent.”</p><p>“In other words, I was not joking with the Ancestral Tree Dragon Apricot… You have to die!”</p><p>Before Greedy the Cat Spirit could react, this friendly human who had a smile on his face moved the divine Sinan with his fingertips.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>Starlight swept across, Great Annihilation Technique!</p><p>The Demi-saint’s power dealt a devastating blow to the seedling of the disaster beast, a ghost beast that was not even a higher void!</p><p>“Ouch!”</p><p>However, Greedy the Cat Spirit opened its mouth and swallowed.</p><p>The power of the Great Annihilation Technique was like a sea of stones that was swallowed without any ripples.</p><p>“Meow?”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit burped and looked at the human in front of it with a sense of unfulfilled satisfaction.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang broke out in a cold sweat. He did not dare to stop the ‘Great Inspection Technique’. He constantly examined himself to ascertain that he was no longer affected by the Blood World Pearl’s power of guidance.</p><p>Using an energy attack on a Body of Devour was no different from using a meat bun to hit a dog.</p><p>I’m so stupid!</p><p>“Great Purification Technique!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang concluded that this ghost beast had lost some of its memories.</p><p>Perhaps it was because the Ancestral Tree Dragon Apricot had done something to it that it did not resist or hate him.</p><p>That was why it didn’t react at all when he stabbed Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>As for the Great Purification Technique, it could use energy from the starlight as a carrier to purify the abnormality on Greedy the Cat Spirit’s body and heal it.</p><p>Then when it was able to recall, it would fall into a state of resistance.</p><p>‘Resistance’ itself did not mean anything, but when Xu Xiaoshou’s plan was foiled, there would be more variables, and his efforts would be in vain.</p><p>“Ouch.”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit opened its mouth again, and swallowed the starlight of the Great Purification Technique before it could hit it.</p><p>The little cat looked forward to this. This person was quite good…</p><p>“Great Protection Technique!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang frowned and felt that something was wrong. He cast another Divine Secret technique.</p><p>This spell had once protected a remnant of Xu Xiaoshou’s will after his clone self-destructed on Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>There was no need to say much about the healing strength.</p><p>“Ouch.”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit swallowed repeatedly and scratched the air with its little claws. It was extremely happy.</p><p>“Something is wrong with you!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang retreated in shock.</p><p>This swallow type of ghost beast was definitely not just in its infant state.</p><p>Its cute appearance was deceptive. It was actually an adult!</p><p>Otherwise, the three supreme Holy Power would have made the stomach of the swallow type of ghost beast swell and it would have difficulty in its digestion.</p><p>He looked back…</p><p>The vitality spiritual energy of the Apricot Realm was very dense.</p><p>It was rare to see such a paradise in the outside world. This was the place where creatures could mature and evolve quickly.</p><p>“Hu…”</p><p>He had forgotten something or seemed to have thought of something.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
