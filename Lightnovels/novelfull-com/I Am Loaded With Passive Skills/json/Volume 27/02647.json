I can just say the name and you readily understood… Wow, you’re really smart! After you go out, go directly to Master Siren.”</p><p>“At the very least?”</p><p>“That’s right, Senior Dragon Apricot. If nothing unexpected happens, Li Fugui would have already made his move. Ye Xiaotian and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man might come to the Apricot Realm at any time.”</p><p>“Why didn’t you say so before?”</p><p>“If you don’t believe me, what’s the use of me telling you so much? Why, do you want to go back on your word?”</p><p>“I, always keep my word!”</p><p>“Alright, Greedy the Cat Spirit, remember to erase this memory later. If Senior Dragon Apricot is aware of this, Elder Dao the Flamboyant might be able to get it out of it.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“Greedy the Cat Spirit, there’s nothing else to do next. You should continue with the conducting alchemy and refine me… As for me, I will transfer the will of my main body to the newly separated second true body and take on Dao Qiongcang’s attack… I can see that guy really wants to kill me!”</p><p>“Meow…”</p><p>“Greedy the Cat Spirit, I’m running out of time! Later, follow my orders and use the Three Loathsome Eyes to control Senior Dragon Apricot.”</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>“And then for yourself… First, forget about everything we talked about just now. Second, control yourself. When you see Senior Dragon Apricot leave, don’t be emotional or agitated. Continue with the conducting alchemy and refine me, one step at a time!”</p><p>“Meow, meow, meow…”</p><p>“What? You can’t control yourself with the Three Loathsome Eyes? Why didn’t you say so earlier!”</p><p>“Meow…”</p><p>“It’s okay, it’s okay. I didn’t think it through… Senior Dragon Apricot, do you have a way to erase part of Greedy the Cat Spirit’s memory?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>“No, no, if you still remember that you erased Greedy the Cat Spirit’s memory after this, it will be a flaw. Elder Dao the Flamboyant will definitely be able to get it out of you… It’s over! I’m going to die!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I am the Ancestral Tree. How dare you insult me time and again?!”</p><p>“What? What do you mean?”</p><p>“I can erase the memory of Greedy the Cat Spirit and control it. I will then use it to control me and there would not be any memories left, so I won’t know anything about this plan!”</p><p>“Oh, let me think this through…Oh, Senior Dragon Apricot is mighty!”</p><p>“Humph!”</p><p>“So, you don’t need the Three Loathsome Eyes to control yourself anymore. You can do it on your own?”</p><p>“To be on the safe side, let it take control. This Dao chap is unpredictable. I’m afraid there might be variables.”</p><p>“Very good, that’s good… Oh right, the Apricot Realm also has to erase some of its memories to prevent any Spatio-temporal Retrospect and other abilities. Senior Dragon Apricot, thank you for your trouble.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, even the Ancestral Tree can’t remember anything. Do you think that there will still be memories left here?”</p><p>“Very good, that’s great…”</p><p>At this point, Jin Ren finally heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>The arrangements he made before his death could finally be carried out to perfection.</p><p>Moreover, after it was carried out, no one in the world would know about this plan. Even the only person, Jin Ren, who made use of it, would die…</p><p>After his revival, his will would be transferred to his main body in the outside world. What would be left in the next second true body would be the unconscious main body’s consciousness. It waited for Elder Dao the Flamboyant to ‘stimulate’ it.</p><p>Within the Apricot Realm, within the range of Elder Dao the Flamboyant’s reach, no one else knew about this plan!</p><p>Even if he, Dao Qiongcang, had great vision, could he find any clues from all the blank spaces?</p><p>Impossible!</p><p>Jin Ren had calculated everything and even included Dao Qiongcang’s unpredictable abilities. He did not believe that there would be any variables.</p><p>If Elder Dao the Flamboyant could still reverse the heavens and see through this scheme, this main body would be willing to die so he could live up to his ‘unpredictable God and ghosts’ reputation.</p><p>“At that time, if he kills me, it will stimulate the spiritual will of the main body. It should be able to speed up my awakening…”</p><p>“If he doesn’t kill me or stimulate me, then I’ll replace my consciousness and let myself take the brunt of the unexpected situation for my main body. At the very least, I’ll self-destruct and blow up my second true body…”</p><p>“If he were to use the Possession on me and managed to snatch the will of the main body, that will be the worst case scenario…”</p><p>However!</p><p>If it really came to this, he wouldn’t be at his wit’s end.</p><p>Jin Ren mulled over it and recalled the incident at the Tianxuan Gate in the Tiansang Spirit Palace. The grey mist figure, Feng Yujin, wanted to take possession of his main body and it triggered an accident.</p><p>In the worst-case scenario, the main body would not be overwhelmed by the Possession!</p><p>However, the secret might be revealed, so it was better to self-destruct!</p><p>“If he did not do anything, he will sense the abnormality and start to stall for time…”</p><p>“The Spirit of Dragon Apricot would have already brought my main body to the outside world. If I can’t find Kui Leihan, I’ll find Cao Erzhu. If the electric shock treatment doesn’t work, then I’ll use the ‘human’ shock treatment…</p><p>“If I drag it out a little longer, I’ll be able to wake up on my own! I definitely can do it!”</p><p>Jin Ren was extremely resolute.</p><p>At this moment, if he didn’t believe in himself, how could he succeed?</p><p>And all of this was under the worst-case scenario, based on even worse reasoning!</p><p>There was a high possibility that no matter how unpredictable Dao Qiongcang was, he would not be able to force him into such a corner…</p><p>“Everyone, wish me luck!”</p><p>“If this escape plan of mine succeeds, I will definitely pay you back a hundredfold when I reach the Sacred Mountain in the future!”</p><p>When he looked up, Jin Ren’s eyes glittered with murderous intent. He was completely prepared to die.</p><p>In the end, he turned his head and looked at the Ancestral Tree Dragon Apricot… After he hesitated for a moment, he said.</p><p>“Senior Dragon Apricot, I only have one worry left.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, the Ancestral Tree will bless you with good luck and you will succeed!”</p><p>“No, it’s not that…”</p><p>“Oh? Just tell me what it is.”</p><p>“My plan is flawless, but there’s still one variable left. I only hope that Senior Dragon Apricot can escape and even abandon me. However, please don’t be tempted by Elder Dao the Flamboyant and stab me in the back.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou! How dare you humiliate me repeatedly?”</p><p>“I’m just worried that if…”</p><p>“Good! The Ancestral Tree can also be totally honest with you…”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“What you said is all nonsense! It would never happen! That Dao chap would not be able to enter this place… I will also defend the Apricot Realm to the death!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
