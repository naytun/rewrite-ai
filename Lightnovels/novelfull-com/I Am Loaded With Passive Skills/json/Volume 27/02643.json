If he was in trouble, was it not in trouble as well?</p><p>Before Dao Qiongcang could finish, it continued,</p><p>“Of course, the past is fixed, but the future is unpredictable. That’s what ‘heavenly secrets’ mean.”</p><p>“After this incident, Senior’s choice and direction in future will naturally undergo endless Transformation”</p><p>“Therefore, I hope that Senior will think twice before making a decision.”</p><p>When the Spirit of Dragon Apricot heard this, it flew into a rage.</p><p>This threatening intent spread across the entire Apricot Realm. Who would not notice?</p><p>Did he want it to give up on Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>“What do you want!” The Spirit of Dragon Apricot shouted resolutely, and at the same time, it felt vexed.</p><p>What happened in the past has now come to fruition.</p><p>If it had known this would happen, it would have killed him with a claw!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang laughed lightly. It was impossible for him to answer directly, so he casually mentioned something else.</p><p>“I haven’t seen you for many years, but you’re still as elegant as ever. You’re a tall mountain to look up to, making me envious.”</p><p>“How is it that Senior still remembers my name ‘Dao Qiongcang’ but forgot about the bet that day?”</p><p>The aura of the Spirit of Dragon Apricot could not help but be suppressed.</p><p>Yes, it remembered and knew that it had lost.</p><p>Immediately, the eyes of the Spirit of Dragon Apricot burned with raging flames.</p><p>At that time, no one witnessed the bet. Even if it did not admit it now, what could the other party do?</p><p>However, after a long silence…</p><p>Thinking of Xu Xiaoshou’s current bleak situation, Dao Qiongcang was in the limelight and could not be shaken.</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot let out a long sigh.</p><p>“Forget it. I’ll give you all these Dragon Apricot Seeds.”</p><p>The Ancestral Tree shook its crown, and the Dragon Apricot Seeds was about to fall.</p><p>In any case, Xu Xiaoshou had already plucked a batch. He had also obtained the power of the Dragon Ancestor, so he did not need more.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Seeds on the tree’s crown were also owned by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Although the Spirit of Dragon Apricot felt pain, it did not hurt that much.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang hurriedly stretched out his hand. “No, Senior Dragon Apricot must have remembered something wrong.”</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot stopped in its tracks. Enduring the anger of being interrupted by a junior, it focused its gaze.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang slowly explained.</p><p>“The bet that day on how the full tree of Dragon Apricot Seeds must be given to me. It’s just a metaphor.”</p><p>“What we really bet on is that if you (honorific form) lose, you have to agree to one of my conditions!”</p><p>Oh?</p><p>He did not want Dragon Apricot Seeds?</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou was drooling over Dragon Apricot Seeds and was thinking of ways to get it. In the end, he even came up with a method to exchange for the blood of a Holy Emperor.</p><p>In this world, was there anything more tempting than collecting ninety-nine Dragon Apricot Seeds?</p><p>“Other than abandoning Xu Xiaoshou and the Apricot Realm, you can mention anything else.”</p><p>After all, the Spirit of Dragon Apricot was a Long. With a wave of its claws, it agreed to the request.</p><p>This showed that he was a man of his word, willing to admit defeat and put an end to the possibility of being pressured again.</p><p>It also killed Dao Qiongcang’s path of retreat. The Spirit of Dragon Apricot could not abandon its World Lord.</p><p>At the same time, he only said that it could be mentioned…</p><p>You bring it up.</p><p>Whether or not agreeable, it’ll have the final say.</p><p>Whether he was a trustworthy dragon or not depended on whether Dao Qiongcang’s appetite was big or small.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s expression was indifferent.</p><p>From his expression, one could not tell what he was thinking.</p><p>The current situation was indeed extremely troublesome.</p><p>He, Dao Qiongcang, had forcefully crossed the Apricot Realm, but no matter how weak the Ancestral Tree Dragon Apricot was, no matter how low its vigilance was, it had not made a move for tens of millions of years…</p><p>If he really wanted to erupt and fight to the death, even if the probability was one in ten thousand, it was not impossible.</p><p>After all, this was an Ancestral Tree!</p><p>Looking at the current situation of the “Apricot Realm”, Dragon Apricot had clearly evolved into the World Tree and would not easily give up on the World Lord, Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was also not as cold as the Bazhun’an.</p><p>He was loyal and had compassion. This could be seen from the loyalty of the people of the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>Those who did not save those who were kind and righteous were viewed as disloyal.</p><p>Those who did not save those they befriended were viewed as unkind.</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot even dared to accept the bet of giving a handful of Dragon Apricot Seeds.</p><p>It had been living with Xu Xiaoshou for a long time, and it was even willing to become the World Tree. How could it not have any feelings for him?</p><p>Then, if he wanted to get past the Ancestral Tree Dragon Apricot and get or even kill Xu Xiaoshou without triggering the ‘what if’…</p><p>Was that even possible?</p><p>Others might not be able to do it, but Dao Qiongcang was doing it step by step.</p><p>Without any time to think, he pointed in the distance and said meaningfully,</p><p>“The first snow in Yujing is extremely elegant. With the fragrance of osmanthus blossoms, I admire myself.”</p><p>“It’s such a beautiful time. Lord Nine Sacrificial Osmanthus has already set up an Ancestral Tree banquet on the Sacred Mountain and is waiting for you (honorific form).”</p><p>“This banquet will not talk about the Great Path or the current situation. It will only reminisce about the past and pursue love. She looks forward to reminiscing about the chaotic old days with you (honorific form), rejoicing about being bound by the Ancestral Tree, chatting about the pain of a long separation, and discussing the intention of gathering again…”</p><p>“No matter what, I would like to ask Senior Dragon Apricot to at least come to Sacred Mountain with your saint’s will and have a drink with Lord Nine Sacrifices. Don’t let the beauty be alone and wait for a night in vain.”</p><p>“And this is also my request after winning the bet. There’s no need for Dragon Apricot Seeds. Senior Dragon Apricot just needs to attend the banquet.”</p><p>It was that simple?</p><p>At this moment, the Spirit of Dragon Apricot’s eyes were filled with disbelief. At the same time, a thick desire surged out.</p><p>Nine Sacrificial Osmanthus…</p><p>It immediately thought of the graceful, noble, and elegant osmanthus tree.</p><p>Even if its impression of her had already blurred with the passage of time, her temperament would not change!</p><p>Different from other ordinary trees, the Nine Sacrificial Osmanthus was so graceful…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
