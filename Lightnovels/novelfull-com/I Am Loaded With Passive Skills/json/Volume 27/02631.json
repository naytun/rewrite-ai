He shook his finger. “No, no, no. I only said that you were hard to kill. I never said that you wouldn’t die.”</p><p>“Didn’t you want me to understand everything before I die?”</p><p>Jin Ren was calm. Even in such a chaotic situation, he started to search through his thoughts for a way out. He said calmly. “I’m all ears!”</p><p>“There is no need to be anxious. You will have a clear understanding before your death. This can be considered as my apology for bullying the weak…”</p><p>“And if you can walk out of this life with clarity and understanding, then I am willing to use my lifetime’s reputation to help you. I am even willing to concede that you are better than me.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had a subtle expression.</p><p>The more Jin Ren listened, the more panicked he felt.</p><p>If an outsider had such an expression and revealed to him all his plans before he killed someone, his smile would be like a flower in bloom!</p><p>Wasn’t this giving away an opportunity?</p><p>But this Dao Qiongcang…</p><p>This guy was known for being unpredictable. If he really dared to lay everything out, didn’t that mean that he was really confident?</p><p>In this game, this guy had entered early and followed him from the beginning to the present. Didn’t this indirectly prove that he had already made up his mind?</p><p>“Do you still remember this person?”</p><p>While his thoughts were in a mess, Dao Qiongcang’s fingertips moved. He used the divine path pattern to outline the figure of a graceful woman in midair.</p><p>Dongdong?</p><p>Jin Ren knew who she was.</p><p>Previously, when his spiritual senses were in Li Fugui’s body, he had heard that this person was Aunt Xiang’s personal maid.</p><p>After he switched to Zhu Yike, he saw for himself the traces left behind when Dongdong used the Divine Secret.</p><p>After that, she sacrificed herself to the Dao and summoned Dao Qiongcang’s demi-saint incarnation!</p><p>“Wait a minute…”</p><p>“Summoned?”</p><p>Even as he thought about it now, he was still shocked by that scene back then.</p><p>That was because Dao Qiongcang had walked out of Dongdong’s body one step at a time, while the latter had slowly withered away.</p><p>The scene of the exchange in the path of death was strange and terrifying.</p><p>This Divine Secret technique was even more powerful than the evil techniques of the Southern Region!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang waved his hand and the woman’s phantom dispersed. He said in a meaningful manner.</p><p>“Very good, you must already know what I wanted to say.”</p><p>“After all, there is only one bit about this person that you have tried fruitlessly to figure out…”</p><p>“So, what are your thoughts?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was a little curious and asked indirectly. “Possession? Summoning? Or was it some evil technique of the Southern Region? Or was it a ghost beast?”</p><p>Jin Ren remained silent.</p><p>He could not come to any conclusions.</p><p>That should be a type of Divine Secret, but it was a type of Divine Secret that he had never seen before…</p><p>If one only looked at the outer appearance and not the essence, even if one was proficient in the Weaving Expertise and had the Art of Spiritual Array Disc, they would not be able to break through Dao Qiongcang’s technique that hid his countless tricks.</p><p>“Actually, you’ve seen it before!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang suddenly said something shocking. “I’ve given you many hints over the past few days. It’s about how you’ll die… And you didn’t notice anything.”</p><p>Hints?</p><p>Jin Ren’s heart was jolted.</p><p>He felt that Dao Qiongcang treated this as a game, and he had become a player who was lost in the maze.</p><p>The feeling of not being aware of what laid ahead was not good!</p><p>When he realized that his mentality was a little unstable due to the verbal provocation, Jin Ren quickly calmed down.</p><p>Perhaps…</p><p>Elder Dao the Flamboyant had never been able to kill him!</p><p>He just plotted a scheme to mess up his composure and then tried find an opportunity to take advantage of it, just like Bei Huai!</p><p>“Elder Dao the Flamboyant, your joke is not funny at all.” Jin Ren mocked.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang closed his eyes and shook his head. He seemed to be a little disappointed that Xu Xiaoshou had taken his best technique as a joke and had not taken his trump card seriously.</p><p>“And now, what?”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, a shattered Divine Elf jumped out from his back. It was Xiao Qi!</p><p>At this moment, Xiao Qi was surrounded by purple lightning. It was obvious that it had been hit severely by the God Punishment Tribulation and was overcome by the effects.</p><p>It was barely able to fly. When it came out, it wanted to say hello, but all it could utter was an ‘Uh’ sound.</p><p>“Zi zi…”</p><p>It only made this little sound.</p><p>Jin Ren suddenly realized that even Dao Qiongcang couldn’t withstand the damage inflicted by the first generation of the Penetrating Divine Senses, God Punishment Tribulation.</p><p>He let the Divine Elf, Xiao Qi bear the brunt of the attack?</p><p>“That’s right. Even the sword cognition that penetrated the body could prevent the wounds from healing normally.”</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang’s head was blown off by the God Punishment Tribulation. If he could not deal with the side effects of the Penetrating Divine Senses, he probably would not be able to return to the battlefield in time…”</p><p>At this point, Jin Ren looked up at Cao Erzhu, who still hovered in the sky and was being respectful to the air.</p><p>This big guy was really stupid. A mere illusion could be used to deal with him.</p><p>However, if someone could pull him out of the fantasy realm, his combat strength would truly be formidable!</p><p>Such a fierce fellow, the last one he saw was The Divine…</p><p>Soon, Jin Ren realized that his thoughts had strayed from the main topic.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang let Xiao Qi out, not to let him see how badly injured it was, but for another reason.</p><p>But…</p><p>When he looked at the Divine Elf’s aura, one who was on the verge of death, Jin Ren could not see any clues.</p><p>“I’m sorry. You probably won’t be able to think of anything with this appearance.”</p><p>“Then, what about now?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang laughed and his expression changed. He tilted his head to look at the Divine Elf and said in a serious tone.</p><p>“Xiao Qi, get ready…”</p><p>In an instant, it seemed that Jin Ren’s mind was hit by a thunderbolt.</p><p>He knew what Dao Qiongcang was going to do!</p><p>Wasn’t this scene similar to the previous scene where the Five Decays of Heaven and Man self-destructed, that the Spirit of Dragon Apricot had sent over in the Apricot Realm?</p><p>At that time, Dao Qiongcang had used many methods to control the Five Decays of Heaven and Man till he had no way out. However, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man continued to struggle and strove to escape.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
