Lord Shou, do you still remember your promise? If possible, can you keep the position vacant for me? Of course, Old Zhu is aware that this is an extravagant hope. If Old Zhu died in the end, this position could actually be given to anyone, but it could not be given to Li… Old Li!”</p><p>Just as Zhu Yike’s voice fell, a big-bellied evil spirit appeared behind him. It grabbed him and stuffed him into its mouth.</p><p>“Seal!”</p><p>Xi slapped the evil ghost’s stomach with his palm and branded it with the Hell’s Lord White Sin’s spiritual imprint before he patted the big-bellied ghost’s head.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Wu…</p><p>Amidst the sound of the cold wind, the evil ghost disappeared together with Zhu Yike.</p><p>“Dong dong dong…”</p><p>There was a slight sound in the distance, like that of a giant running, and the leaves rustled in the night.</p><p>Xi seemed to be moved and looked at Hallmaster Dao. He wanted to say something but stopped.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang did not say anything. He looked away and waved his hand again. An illuminated gate appeared.</p><p>This time, it was Xiang Yaoyao of the Ten High Nobles who emerged.</p><p>“It’s over?”</p><p>Aunt Xiang seemed to know her fate.</p><p>She looked around. Other than the familiar remains of the Divine Puppet, there were no other elites from the Saint Servant.</p><p>“Looks like you were not able to catch any big fish.” Aunt Xiang laughed and looked at Dao Qiongcang with a mocking gaze.</p><p>“The good show has just begun. It’s just that you’re not fated to see it.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang shook his head and walked forward. His hand stopped in front of Xiang Yaoyao’s voluptuous bosom. “Take it out.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang sneered and thrust her chest out. It almost touched Dao Qiongcang’s fingers.</p><p>Xi’s face turned red and he hurriedly averted his gaze and did not dare to look.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang flicked his fingers and used the Greater Teleportation Technique to take out a jade talisman that was stuffed into Xiang Yaoyao’s chest.</p><p>Jin Ren in the Ran Ming ruins felt his scalp go numb when he saw this.</p><p>It was the Apricot Realm jade talisman!</p><p>This was the life-saving item he had left for Aunt Xiang in the Yougui Pavilion!</p><p>Even if Dao Qiongcang got hold of it… It was totally fine. This jade talisman was only a one-sided communication with the Apricot Realm. To open the passageway, it still needed the ancestral tree Dragon Apricot’s approval.</p><p>However, that was not the main point. The main point was that Dao Qiongcang had revealed all his trump cards. It was obvious that he was about to reel in his catch.</p><p>Jin Ren wanted to extend his spiritual senses into the distance.</p><p>He had heard a strange noise just now. Someone must have barged into Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>Was it Bazhun’an?</p><p>If it was, then it was indeed enough to stop Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>However, just like what Dao Qiongcang said, Jin Ren did not think that Bazhun’an would fall into a trap just to save his spiritual senses…</p><p>Most likely, it would be either Master Siren, a Saint Servant or a higher void whose combat strength was comparable to that of a demi-saint.</p><p>In that case, it might be a little too much to say that it was merely a drop in the bucket, but if it was of no help, that might be the best way to describe it?</p><p>It was better that it did not come…</p><p>Moreover, Dao Qiongcang’s appetite was not that small. Even Master Siren might not be able to fill it up…</p><p>Just as he was deep in thought, Dao Qiongcang waved his hand and concluded.</p><p>“Take her to the Dead Sea and put her in solitary confinement.”</p><p>“Don’t let anyone, any living thing, inanimate object, or even anything that can be defined as an ‘existence’ other than you, come into contact with her or hurt her…”</p><p>“That includes herself, self-harm and suicide!”</p><p>“If anything happens to her, I will kill you first. Even if your Teacher comes, he won’t be able to protect you. Do you understand?”</p><p>Xi was shocked. This was the first time he had heard Hallmaster Dao use such a serious tone and issue such lengthy instructions.</p><p>It just showed how important this matter was!</p><p>And the person in front of him, even though he said that she was one of the Ten High Nobles, her actual combat strength was only that of an ordinary higher void, right?</p><p>“Yes, Hallmaster Dao!” Xi swallowed and nodded intently.</p><p>“Take her away.”</p><p>“Yes, sir!”</p><p>Xi subconsciously wanted to use the ghost spirit to seal the person, but he realized that this did not conform to Hallmaster Dao’s instructions and could only give up helplessly.</p><p>He turned to look at the beautiful woman…</p><p>Different from Zhu Yike, Aunt Xiang had experienced so much, but only her clothes were slight damaged from the force of Kui Leihan’s residual power.</p><p>She was basically uninjured!</p><p>Xi stretched out his hand and suddenly retracted it as if he had been electrocuted.</p><p>He couldn’t possibly carry Xiang Yaoyao on his shoulders, could he?</p><p>Xi’s footsteps were as heavy as lead. He braced himself and walked in front of Aunt Xiang first. Then, he did not dare to move, nor did he dare to tie her up. Even to touch her made him feel as if he was about to die…</p><p>He was at a loss.</p><p>Aunt Xiang was amused. She smiled and glanced at the young man before she started to walk down the mountain.</p><p>“Let’s go, young man. I have my own legs and can walk.”</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>As the fragrance drifted away in the night, across the deserted site, only Aunt Xiang’s voice could be heard.</p><p>“Young man, how old are you this year?”</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>“You look like you’re only around twenty. Are you married? Are you still a virgin?”</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>“You cultivate the Phantom Swords Technique? Who was the Teacher that Elder Dao the Flamboyant spoke about? Do you know… Oh, who was it again? Deng something?”</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>“Yes, Hua Changdeng! Aunt actually forgot this name. This is amazing. I wonder if I will be killed if I call his name a few more times. I’m so scared, but I’m also rather excited. Hua Changdeng, Hua Changdeng, Hua Changdeng…”</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>“Oh right, young man, your name is Xi, right? If you are an ancient swordsman, you should worship Bazhun’an? Do you know that back then, your Teacher was actually obsessed with the sword. In the end, the Holy Emperor aristocratic family insisted on arranging a marriage for him. He actually didn’t like Yue…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
