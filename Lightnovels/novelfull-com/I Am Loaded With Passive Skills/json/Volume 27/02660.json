It was like a mad dog, biting everyone it saw.</p><p>The Power Upanishad Formation lit up, and the Path Principles of Space guided Ye Xiaotian. His afterimage remained where he was as he leaped into the sky.</p><p>However, at the same time, Ye Xiaotian was stunned.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>The ghost beast opened its mouth, but instead of biting down, it sucked in once more.</p><p>In an instant, the Way of the Heavens crumbled, and Ye Xiaotian’s spiritual technique was interrupted. He suffered a backlash and was frozen in midair. At the same time, he was sucked back by the terrifying suction force.</p><p>The ghost beast seemed to have expected that as it opened its mouth and bit forward.</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian tried to get out of the beast’s grasp.</p><p>But even so, he was still too slow.</p><p>The ghost beast was too big. Ye Xiaotian had only pulled out one of his legs when he felt a sharp pain from his lower body. His upper body was broken and sent flying.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The pain almost numbed everything in his mind.</p><p>Caught off guard, Ye Xiaotian, who had been proud and complacent after sanctification, nearly had his Dao heart crumbled.</p><p>“I was bitten?” he thought.</p><p>Before he could react to what had happened…</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>A blood-colored object flew over and smashed into Ye Xiaotian’s face. Ye Xiaotian hurriedly grabbed it and took a look, only to find it rather familiar…</p><p>It was his leg that had been broken and flew out!</p><p>Ye Xiaotian scanned the area with his saint’s will and was shocked to discover that the ghost beast had eaten one of his legs and sent the other flying. The remaining half of his body was sent flying far away with his blood-colored intestines in tow.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Qingyuan Mountain was deathly silent.</p><p>Mei Siren, Five Decays of Heaven and Man, Cao Erzhu, and Yu Zhiwen stood frozen on the spot.</p><p>What kind of monster was that?</p><p>Wasn’t it a little too terrifying?</p><p>Spatial Upanishad was the fastest in the world, and spatial teleportation was even more unstoppable.</p><p>No matter how conceited and unguarded Ye Xiaotian was, how could the monster possibly bite off half of his body in one go?</p><p>“Body of Devour…”</p><p>“Three Loathsome Eyes…”</p><p>A red light flashed in the eyes of Five Decays of Heaven and Man, who was wearing a mask. After recalling the scene just now, he felt incredulous.</p><p>That technique…</p><p>Wasn’t it like a ghost beast version of himself?</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>Mei Siren did not dare to delay any longer.</p><p>The destructive power of the ghost beast was simply too great. It had bitten off half of Ye Xiaotian’s body the moment it appeared. If it were to be released from the Qingyuan Mountain and intrude into a city with a large population in the Central Region, a bloodbath would ensue.</p><p>However, just as Mei Siren held the Taicheng Sword and revealed some hostility, the white-haired nine-tailed ghost beast turned its gaze over and let out a loud roar.</p><p>In an instant, the world shattered, and sand and stones rolled. Even Mei Siren was almost sent flying by the power of the roar.</p><p>The Qingyuan Mountain great array was supposed to protect everything around it.</p><p>However, the roar rendered everyone in a daze. When everyone regained their senses, the giant beast’s sharp claws had already swatted downwards.</p><p>Everyone panicked and wanted to rush into the sky to resist.</p><p>The pupils of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man trembled as he roared, “Close your eyes, everyone!”</p><p>Stunned, everyone didn’t react, and no one closed their eyes.</p><p>The world in everyone’s eyes darkened at that critical moment.</p><p>In that moment of darkness, three blood-colored spots appeared in the eyes of the white-haired beast and flowed into its pupils.</p><p>However, it did not manage to control anyone…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The moment of darkness also brought about a gap in defense.</p><p>When everyone regained their senses, the beast’s claw had already struck Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>Qingyuan Mountain was shattered on the spot.</p><p>The great array did not activate its true defensive power at all. It had been passively supported by the Divine Secret, so it was naturally blown to nothingness.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen opened his mouth and spat out blood. Blood gushed out of his seven orifices as he fell to the ground.</p><p>Mei Siren could only place the Taicheng Sword in front of his chest and summon a half-sword image.</p><p>The beast’s sharp claws had already pierced through the gap, drawing a bloody wound on his chest.</p><p>“God Punishment Tribulation!”</p><p>In the darkness, the only one who relied on his battle instinct to ignite himself on the spot was Cao Erzhu.</p><p>He did not know what had happened.</p><p>But he knew that at the critical moment, someone had to step forward.</p><p>When Cao Erzhu regained consciousness, a sea of lightning exploded above Cao Erzhu’s head after he had finished accumulating his power in the darkness.</p><p>He punched in the direction of the beast’s claws.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>That strange suction force appeared again.</p><p>Cao Erzhu couldn’t hear a single sound. He only felt that all his strength had been devoured. And could only see lightning flowing around the giant white beast.</p><p>In the next second…</p><p>He was blasted into the space debris by the claw.</p><p>“Don’t hurt it. It’s Greedy the Cat Spirit!” an anxious shout sounded.</p><p>Standing on the Space Dao Discs, Xu Xiaoshou’s second true body, which had quickly flashed out of the Apricot Realm, was stunned for a moment when it landed on Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>He hurriedly announced his words and faced the monster that had lost control.</p><p>“Greedy the Cat Spirit, don’t hurt anyone!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
