Except the red-clothed people, not many people dared to make any related comments.</p><p>Yet, the Judicial Division mentioned it in the indictment of Dao Qiongcang?</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao is in danger.”</p><p>Everyone’s hearts trembled as they realized that the conference was a larger deal than they thought.</p><p>Perhaps, Dao Qiongcang might even lose his head.</p><p>Even Fang Wenxin frowned and glanced suspiciously at Dao Qiongcang, who still looked calm.</p><p>The golden-robed man seemed to be oblivious to all of that and continued to announce Dao Qiongcang’s sins without any emotion.</p><p>“Fifth, he colluded with the ghost beast to harm the continent. He secretly broke the Four Symbol Secrets and controlled the Holy Emperor Qilin, causing disasters in the five regions and countless deaths and injuries.”</p><p>There was a commotion among the audiencce.</p><p>Indeed, Holy Emperor Qilin, Holy Emperor Bei Huai, and Xu Xiaoshou’s Ultimate Giant fought from Qilin to the Central Yuan world. In the end, the ghost beast still escaped.</p><p>Everyone only realized later that it was Dao Qiongcang’s scheme.</p><p>After all, if word got out that the mighty Dao Qiongcang failed to contain the ghost beast, it would be a stain on his name.</p><p>“I have something to say.” Dao Qiongcang took half a step forward and raised his hand.</p><p>The golden-robed judge holding the edict didn’t move, and neither did the one holding the seal.</p><p>The one with the sword turned around and looked at Dao Qiongcang indifferently. He said firmly, “Shut up!”</p><p>With a swoosh, a pin drop could be heard on Sacred Mountain.</p><p>There were gasps among the spectators, but they stopped abruptly and kept quiet.</p><p>Elder Yu’s eyes widened, and his toes on his tattered straw sandals were raised high.</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi immediately stood and looked straight ahead. He even stopped mumbling incessantly.</p><p>The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body had its arms akimbo and unconsciously clenched his hands tightly, its eyes filled with nervousness.</p><p>Fang Wenxin was still looking into the distance, his eyes growing more and more serious.</p><p>The nine copper coins on his waist suddenly moved despite there being no wind and made a clanging noise.</p><p>It was ear-piercing in the dead silence.</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>Fang Wenxin subconsciously moved his feet and was about to move forward.</p><p>Elder Yu seemed to have sensed something and looked into the distance as well. Then, he quickly reached out and pulled the red-clothed man back.</p><p>“Hold your horses. Why are you in such a hurry? Read the room.”</p><p>Fang Wenxin was stunned. Only then did he notice that everyone’s eyes were focused on Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>He turned his head and looked over.</p><p>The magnitude of the movement made everyone’s hearts jump again.</p><p>“All right, judge…”</p><p>Behind him, Dao Qiongcang looked at the sword-wielding golden-robed man.</p><p>He quickly retracted his gaze and took half a step back to his original position. The muscles at the corner of his lips twitched slightly.</p><p>“Where are your manners?” The golden-robed man’s gaze was like a sword.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang lowered his head. His black hair was already covered in spots of white snow. He replied, “Yes, Your Honour.”</p><p>Amidst the snow and wind, for some reason, everyone on the Sacred Mountain felt a sense of sorrow.</p><p>Even the spectators at the side felt desolate, as if they had witnessed the falling of something to ruins.</p><p>“Six…”</p><p>The voice of the golden-robed judge holding the edict continued to sound.</p><p>Almost 90% of the people on the Sacred Mountain couldn’t hear what he was saying, and only shock remained in their hearts.</p><p>After all, it was Hallmaster Dao they were talking about.</p><p>Regardless of the results, he worked hard.</p><p>Even if he had made a mistake, how could he be publicly humiliated like that?</p><p>However, when they thought of how the three gold-robed judges looked down on the world and even the Saints, they connected the dots a little more.</p><p>They were rarely seen before because they didn’t come down often.</p><p>The Judicial Division was the supreme existence on the Stairway to Heaven. They represented the will of the Five Great Holy Emperors.</p><p>Everyone was equal in the face of the law.</p><p>What everyone did not expect was that even Hallmaster Dao was included in the “everyone”.</p><p>The corners of Dao Xuanji’s mouth curled up.</p><p>Her empty eyes reflected the trembling figures on the Sacred Mountain, not including Dao Qiongcang, who was behind her.</p><p>No one dared to interrupt the gold-robed judge as he was announcing the crimes. They didn’t even dare to move their toes.</p><p>Dao Xuanji took a deep breath as if there was no one around. She even reached out her hand and gathered snowflakes.</p><p>She rubbed them, crushed them hard, then gently released them, again and again.</p><p>How brazen!</p><p>A kind of exhilaration rose from the soles of the observers’ feet and sublimated through the clouds in the sky, causing them to tremble as if they had been electrocuted.</p><p>Indeed, when one reached the peak, they had nothing to fear.</p><p>The saint’s will looked down, and everyone trembled.</p><p>No one dared to look up.</p><p>In the past, they couldn’t see the saint’s will. But now that they could, they didn’t dare to look up.</p><p>In the end, Dao Xuanji kept the saint’s will aside.</p><p>After a long time… the golden-robed judge listed another eighteen crimes, and few people paid attention to what he said at the end.</p><p>Dao Xuanji did not listen.</p><p>She was the one who drafted the edict, so she knew what the content was.</p><p>In short, Dao Qiongcang had sunk to the bottom of the valley and would never be able to rise again!</p><p>When the indifferent voice came to a stop, Dao Xuanji and everyone on the Sacred Mountain finally came back to their senses.</p><p>“Sinner Dao Qiongcang, do you plead guilty?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
