After he landed, he rolled on the ground and after he dissipated the momentum, he quickly asked.</p><p>“What was that?”</p><p>The two of them were not able to enter Xu Xiaoshou’s Yuan Mansion.</p><p>The moment he was about to step inside, he was hit by a violent, raging, and destructive black energy storm.</p><p>He had really been kicked out!</p><p>If Mei Siren hadn’t reacted in time and protected Cao Erzhu with his sword, he would have followed the shattered space node and jumped out of the spacetime fragments.</p><p>At this moment, they didn’t know where to go.</p><p>Before Mei Siren could confirm it, a low voice came from the side.</p><p>“Ghost beast.”</p><p>Cao and Mei turned their heads and saw that it was the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. He stood at the side and was the one who spoke.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen sat on the ground and looked exhausted. It was as if she was overwhelmed by the effort to maintain the spatial passageway.</p><p>“You didn’t go in?”</p><p>Mei Siren felt that something was wrong and looked suspiciously at the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>To be honest, he had never completely trusted this person.</p><p>On Abyss Island, this person’s position was unclear. Or rather, he was the third party, on Yama’s side. He was not completely on Xu Xiaoshou’s side.</p><p>However, he was helping them out of a sense of justice. It was wrong, or even impossible, to drive him away. After all, they were both demi-saints. If he were to pick a fight with this person, that would mean making another enemy and would be a thankless effort.</p><p>“Little girl, are you alright?”</p><p>When he saw that Yu Zhiwen still sat on the ground, her face pale, Mei Siren helped her up and gave her a questioning look.</p><p>“I’m fine…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen knew what Master Siren was really asking was if her injuries were caused by an outsider and not due to her own exhaustion.</p><p>She shook her head weakly. “I was exhausted and felt a little dizzy for a moment… Eh?”</p><p>She covered her head and felt as if she had forgotten something.</p><p>Soon, she cleared her mind of any distracting thoughts and swallowed some Elixirs. Only then did her color improve a little.</p><p>“The ghost beast that you mentioned…”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Mei Siren turned and looked at the Five Decays of Heaven and Man again.</p><p>“I mean it literally.”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man stood only a few steps away from the three of them, as if they had never crossed this intangible barrier.</p><p>Mei Siren wanted to question him again.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man raised his chin and looked into the distance.</p><p>“He’s here…”</p><p>Weng!</p><p>A dazzling Power Upanishad Formation appeared in the void.</p><p>The white-haired Daoist child, Ye Xiaotian, took a step forward and landed on Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>He stood high in the sky as he looked down at everyone. He thrust out his chest and said proudly.</p><p>“Where’s Xu Xiaoshou?!”</p><p>His voice was filled with high spirits.</p><p>There was a time when Ye Xiaotian had been beaten up by Bazhun’an and Huang Quan.</p><p>On Abyss Island, even a Stone Giant with only half of its spiritual intelligence had chased him all the way. It was extremely humiliating.</p><p>He missed a great opportunity and could only return to the Spirit Palace with the semi-saint person. Fortunately, he managed to survive and underwent sanctification.</p><p>At this moment, even Wangze, the Holy Emperor, could not do anything to him!</p><p>Ye Xiaotian really wanted to see how difficult it would be to save Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>Mishaps happened repeatedly and he was tricked time and again…</p><p>“The Sovereign Dao Realm couldn’t protect Xu Xiaoshou, and the Cutting Path Stage couldn’t protect Xu Xiaoshou. Now that I’m an Upanishad demi-saint, how can I not protect you?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian dared to pat his chest and declared this.</p><p>If I want to protect one person, no matter what position he is at, no matter what state he is in, I will do my best and go all out.</p><p>The king of heavens is here… No matter how bad it was, he could still run off with this person.</p><p>Run to the ends of the earth, until the pursuers give up.</p><p>That was because in the Universe, there was no one who was faster than the Spatial Upanishad, nor anyone stronger who could kill Ye Xiaotian.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian even dared to go to the Dead Sea to retrieve Sang Qiye after some preparation, but there was no need for that.</p><p>The people on the ground looked up and saw the white-haired dwarf who hovered high in the air. Yu Zhiwen was the first to speak up.</p><p>“He is…”</p><p>“No need. I’ll take a look myself.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian waved his hand nonchalantly to stop the outsider from answering.</p><p>Too slow!</p><p>A demi-saint’s time was precious. There was no reason to waste it on a mortal’s rambling explanation!</p><p>Ye Xiaotian didn’t even need to do anything as light swirled within his eyes.</p><p>The power of a Spatial Upanishad demi-saint was fully displayed at this moment.</p><p>As his eyes moved, all the scenes in this place were instantly retraced and replayed.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian saw how Cao Erzhu’s fist sent Dao Qiongcang’s head flying, Mei Siren’s sword image slashing the Qingyuan Mountain great array and Dao Qiongcang’s return to turn the tide and control everything in his hands…</p><p>Even someone who had the powerful God Punishment Tribulation could only bow respectfully to the air.</p><p>Even sword saint Mei, who was so powerful, was stunned by the attack. He could only watch as Xu Xiaoshou’s incarnation died.</p><p>The unpredictable Dao Qiongcang was still unwilling to let the matter rest after he killed Xu Xiaoshou and even chased him into his small world!</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was momentarily dazed after he took in everything.</p><p>He retraced the scenery of this place with some uncertainty and confirmed the identity of the person who had attacked.</p><p>He was not mistaken…</p><p>It was Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>One of the Ten High Nobles, the one on the main seat of the Saint Hall, the one who was known as the one who never missed anything and was unpredictable!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, are you crazy…”</p><p>At that moment, Ye Xiaotian wanted to turn around and leave and head back to the Holy Palace to cool down first.</p><p>However, the three of them below just raised their heads and stared at him. He came valiantly and rolled away in dejection. Would this not make the demi-saint who hovered in the void a laughing stock?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
