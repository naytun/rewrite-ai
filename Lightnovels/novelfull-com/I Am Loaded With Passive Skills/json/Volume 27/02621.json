(1)</p><p>Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>When Cao Erzhu heard this, he initially thought that it was very profound. However, he felt that the knowledge slipped away from his mind very quickly.</p><p>“What do you mean?” He asked as he scratched his head.</p><p>Alright, I will put it in simpler terms…</p><p>Jin Ren didn’t plan to praise either Kui Leihan’s merits or boast about Cao Erzhu’s cultivation level.</p><p>Although this would definitely leave a good impression in the other party’s heart.</p><p>But sincere people should be treated with sincerity.</p><p>If Jin Ren wanted to, there were tens of thousands of ways he could trick Cao Erzhu and invite him to join the First Pavilion in the Sky. This would certainly benefit him greatly.</p><p>In the end, he decided not to do so and planned to be more direct.</p><p>“Please accept my condolences on your father’s demise.”</p><p>“You know Elder You Tu and Elder You Tu is on good terms with Master Siren. I am Master Siren’s student.”</p><p>“In this case, you, Cao Erzhu, can be considered as my friend. I do not want to let you fall into a quagmire. Therefore, I want to ask you…”</p><p>Friend… Cao Erzhu was slightly distracted when he heard this.</p><p>He had always been the one who took the initiative to befriend others. Very few people took the initiative to say that they were his friend.</p><p>Even if this friend didn’t look like a human.</p><p>Cao Erzhu hugged the head of the array wheel.</p><p>He treated nature as his friend, including the mountains and rivers. Even if this was just a lump of iron that could speak, he would not underestimate it.</p><p>In the end, he felt that it was not good to look down on him, so he raised his friend in front of him and looked at him at eye level.</p><p>“Brother Shou…”</p><p>In Er Zhu’s eyes, this lump of iron could speak. It must have cultivated a spirit. It was older than him and needed to be addressed with respect.</p><p>If the other party had not said that he wanted to be his friend, he would actually address him as Senior Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Brother Shou, what do you want to ask me? I’ll answer you truthfully!” He asked his new friend.</p><p>“Erzhu, what are your plans for the future?” Jin Ren went straight to the point.</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s eyes flashed with confusion.</p><p>For twenty-six years, he had only been in the small town and Qingyuan Mountain. He knew nothing about the outside world.</p><p>His plan was to bury his father…</p><p>Nothing else.</p><p>Or he would leave the town and go somewhere else.</p><p>Or enter the Spiritual Cultivation world, but how to enter it, where to go, and what to do… he had no clue at all.</p><p>Cao Erzhu looked helplessly at the old immortal, but he also felt that this was not something that an outsider could decide for him.</p><p>Being independent was the trademark of a real man.</p><p>He lowered his head and said in a depressed tone. “I don’t know. My father said that I’m not smart. I will be easily deceived when I go out. Maybe I should continue to stay in the town.”</p><p>“Is this what you want?” Jin Ren asked. When he saw Cao Erzhu opening his mouth to answer, he said, “Just answer this question according to your conscience.”</p><p>Conscience… Cao Erzhu touched his chest and quickly shook his head firmly. “No!”</p><p>“You have already told me what you yearn for.”</p><p>Jin Ren did not need to ask more. He knew that a person who was so excited about the demi-saint battle would not be content to stay in a corner.</p><p>Cao Erzhu would definitely step into the Spiritual Cultivation world!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang already knew about this ‘peerless genius’, so he definitely wouldn’t let him go.</p><p>“If you want to join the Spiritual Cultivation world, my personal recommendation is to join… the Holy Divine Palace.” Jin Ren said.</p><p>Mei Siren who stood at the back, suddenly looked back at the head of the array wheel in shock.</p><p>He had thought that Xu Xiaoshou would get the ball rolling and try to lure Cao Erzhu into the Saint Servant or his First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>What did he have in mind when he told him to join the Holy Divine Palace?</p><p>“Holy Divine Palace…” Cao Erzhu muttered, but he actually did not ask what this was. Clearly, he had heard of it before.</p><p>“The Holy Divine Palace is the number one righteous faction on the continent. It is backed by the Five Great Holy Emperor aristocratic family. It is deeply rooted and its upper limit is endless.”</p><p>“You only need to go to Jade Capital City or any other big cities, look for a side hall of the Holy Divine Palace, and say that you want to join the white-clothed people.”</p><p>“Remember, you can only go to the white-clothed people. Don’t join the red-clothed people. They are too complicated. You are too qualified for the Holy Divine Guards so you don’t have to consider it.”</p><p>“There will be so many talents, definitely there will be so many talented people. They will recognize your capability and you can be assured of a bright future.”</p><p>“And last but not least, Erzhu, don’t join the elites.”</p><p>“With your personality, you’re not suited to join the people at the Saint mountain headquarters. It’s a cesspool there. You’re only suitable to be a fierce general and fight outside.”</p><p>“Even if they offer you the position of the Ruler of the white-clothed people, don’t accept it!”</p><p>“However, at that time, it might not be up to you to decide whether to accept it or not…But if it were up to you, you might really be able to refuse.”</p><p>After Jin Ren finished speaking, he sighed.</p><p>He knew that if he did not have the Infernal Fire Seed at that time, and if there were no Night Guardian and Bazhun’an, then this path…</p><p>After the main body left the Spirit Palace and understood the nature of this world, it was the best way out if he wanted someone to rely on.</p><p>He placed the path that he had never walked before in front of Cao Erzhu.</p><p>Cao Erzhu did not agree immediately. Instead, he asked. “Brother Shou, are you all from the Holy Divine Palace?”</p><p>He even looked at the old immortal Mei.</p><p>Mei Siren smiled and shook his head. He glanced at the head of the array wheel.</p><p>Regardless whether Xu Xiaoshou was sincere or not, he recognized Xu Xiaoshou’s path and would naturally support his student.</p><p>“I am not. I am from the First Pavilion in the Sky.”</p><p>“The First Pavilion in the Sky?” Cao Erzhu’s gaze changed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
