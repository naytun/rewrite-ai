Just thinking about it, it sounds like a legendary tale!”</p><p>“Kui Leihan also has a son. Has he broken new ground? Has Kui Leihan become obsolete?” Dao Qiongcang retorted with a question instead of an answer.</p><p>“Uh…” Jin Ren had never seen Cao Erzhu, but the answer seemed negative.</p><p>“Actually, I share the same thought as you,” Dao Qiongcang suddenly continued:</p><p>“The Holy Emperor’s aristocratic family practices a unique method of internal bloodline continuation. With each generation, the power diminishes, even if it seems negligible.”</p><p>“But over time, even if they still hold the position of Holy Emperor, the abilities of their descendants are far inferior to their ancestors.”</p><p>“Therefore, it’s impossible to perfectly inherit the power, which is the essential reason why high-level Holy Emperors have become increasingly rare.”</p><p>“This method of continuation itself has flaws. Unless, once every few generations, there appears a prodigy with talent comparable to the Ten High Nobles, who can reverse fate and restore the bloodline…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang smiled mysteriously, “Do you know why the War of the Ten High Nobles ended after the previous generation?”</p><p>Jin Ren was startled.</p><p>Zhu Yike’s pupils dilated.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>The two spoke simultaneously, one with surprise, the other with a weak voice.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang glanced at the cushion beneath him, his lips quirked up. “Divine secrets must not be revealed.”</p><p>Damn!</p><p>Jin Ren had always wanted to kill Elder Dao the Flamboyant, and now more than ever.</p><p>But at this moment, he was powerless to resist. It was strange that Dao Qiongcang was telling him all this.</p><p>He couldn’t let himself fall into the rhythm of Elder Dao the Flamboyant, so he abruptly asked:</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, what about you? How old is your child?”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s pupils focused again, and he strained his abdomen, nearly sending the person on top of him flying.</p><p>Curiosity piqued…</p><p>Dao Qiongcang gazed at the night sky, murmuring, “Ten years old, I suppose.”</p><p>“What?” Jin Ren was dumbfounded. “You really have a child?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Then where did you get ten years…”</p><p>“You asked, so I answered. Wouldn’t it be rude not to?” Dao Qiongcang chuckled.</p><p>“…” Jin Ren was speechless. Elder Dao was too cheeky.</p><p>“Alright, you’ve asked, now it’s my turn.” Dao Qiongcang lay back, arms behind his head, and turned to Jin Ren.</p><p>Jin Ren became vigilant.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang: “Xu Xiaoshou, do you want a child?”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s eyes lit up instantly, twisting his head so sharply that he nearly broke his neck, looking toward Lord Shou.</p><p>Lord Shou: “…”</p><p>Why did Elder Dao suddenly remind him of Aunt Xiang?</p><p>“Don’t want one? You don’t like children? Or you haven’t thought about having a descendant?” Dao Qiongcang pressed.</p><p>“…Not exactly.”</p><p>“So, you do want children. Who do you want them with?”</p><p>Didn’t this question seem overly direct?</p><p>Jin Ren didn’t know how to respond, how to counter such bluntness with equal wit.</p><p>“Let’s start with a fundamental question!” Dao Qiongcang was very serious, “Do you like men or women?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Jin Ren’s spiritual senses scanned the surroundings, confirming they were indeed on Qingyuan Mountain, not in a dream.</p><p>How did such a topic come up?</p><p>The highest leaders of the First Pavilion in the Sky and the Holy Divine Palace, discussing such frivolous matters on Qingyuan Mountain?</p><p>If this spread…</p><p>The Night Battle at Qingyuan, fighting to the death over these trivial things?</p><p>“Even Senior Dao doesn’t have children. I’m still young, so I haven’t considered it yet.” Jin Ren chuckled.</p><p>“You and I are different,” Dao Qiongcang snorted disdainfully, saying with a haughty air:</p><p>“I am a noble descendant of the Holy Emperor, my bloodline determined by fate.”</p><p>“You are a lowly ant, with ordinary blood flowing in your veins… If you don’t find a good sacred physique to continue your bloodline, your children will likely achieve far less than you.”</p><p>“Under your reputation, anything ordinary would be a sin. They would probably die young.”</p><p>Jin Ren was furious.</p><p>He didn’t even have children yet!</p><p>And he was cursing them to die young?</p><p>“You idiot!” he cursed outright.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang didn’t mind, his eyes darting around, “But if you could pair with a Holy Emperor’s bloodline, even if it’s a lesser one, though not as pure as the Holy Emperor’s bloodline but still an extraordinary sacred physique… your descendants would definitely be exceptional!”</p><p>“What nonsense are you spewing?” Jin Ren sensed that Dao Qiongcang had some ulterior motive.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang rose with a smile.</p><p>“Sigh.” Zhu Yike felt a weight lifted off him and was eager to rise. Lord Shou’s future was of interest to everyone.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Elder Dao’s fist slammed down.</p><p>Under the weapon prohibition order, Zhu Yike’s eyes rolled back as he fainted in anger.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang leaned down, his expression amiable, staring at the Divine Puppet with a chuckle.</p><p>“What do you think of Little Yu?”</p><p>Jin Ren’s mind went blank momentarily.</p><p>“?”</p><p>So that’s what Dao Qiongcang was getting at?!</p><p>“Little Yu? Which Little Yu?”</p><p>“Which other Little Yu could it be? Do you have many Little Yus? Isn’t there only Yu Zhiwen who treats you well?” Dao Qiongcang sneered.</p><p>“…”</p><p>“What, she doesn’t treat you well?” Dao Qiongcang seemed surprised, pulling out numerous reports:</p><p>“In the White Cave, surrounded by the red-clothed people, she called out and saved your life, right?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
