He has caused countless damage to the Holy Divine Palace and the Shengshen Continent.”</p><p>“Because of his past hard work and meritorious service, he was appointed as the Acting Hallmaster in hopes that he could atone for his sins. Unexpectedly, he did not repent after that and committed several wrongdoings.”</p><p>“I will now list the crimes as follows.”</p><p>“First, he underestimated the enemy due to not-so-thorough investigation, resulting in the death of the first three emperors, Yan Wuse, Rao Yaoyao, the former red-clothed people ruler, and the Divine Oracle Number Two.”</p><p>“Second, mistreatment of subordinates. He disregarded the red-clothed people, the white-clothed people, and the heads and members of the six tribes, abandoning them when they were in need.”</p><p>“Third, neglect of duties to strategise well. The Sacred Mountain has many talents, but he didn’t employ them. As a result, Sky City finally fell into the hands of the Saint Servant. This is an unpardonable mistake.”</p><p>“Fourth, improper use of personnel, indecisive decision-making…”</p><p>“Fifth, failed to safeguard Xuan Cang…”</p><p>“Six…”</p><p>One crime after another was read out by the golden-robed man of the Judicial Division in an indifferent tone in front of the people of the Sacred Mountain and the audience.</p><p>The more they listened, the more panicked they felt.</p><p>“Terrifying… They’re ruthlessly shaming the Hallmaster.”</p><p>“About the situation in the Sky City, didn’t Hallmaster Dao do a good job? We didn’t lose. It was the Saint Servant who was too cunning, and his plan was too thorough!”</p><p>“That may be so for others, but not Dao Qiongcang. If it was him, he shouldn’t have lost so badly. What the Judicial Division said makes sense, doesn’t it?”</p><p>“Sigh…”</p><p>The audience were divided in opinion.</p><p>Most people felt that Hallmaster Dao should not be treated like that, while a small number of people felt that it was only natural.</p><p>As for Dao Qiongcang…</p><p>Everyone looked in his direction and only saw that his expression was calm. His gaze was fixed on Dao Xuanji, who was standing on his seat, and no emotions could be seen.</p><p>Elder Yu let out a long sigh and retreated to Fang Wenxin’s side. He shook his head and said, “They’re taking it too far. If Little Dao could only do so much, wouldn’t someone else in his position perform even worse?”</p><p>As there was no reply, Elder Yu used his shoulder to nudge the old red-clothed man. “What do you think?”</p><p>Fang Wenxin had his brows tightly knitted and his eyes half-closed. He ignored the scene of the verdict and only looked up into the distance, muttering worriedly, “Too slow…”</p><p>“What?” Elder Yu thought he heard wrong. Were they talking about the same thing?</p><p>“They’re talking too slow!” Fang Wenxin turned his head.</p><p>“Do you have something on?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Is it urgent?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Don’t act rashly. They’re from the Judicial Division,” Elder Yu hurriedly advised.</p><p>“I know.” Fang Wenxin glanced back at the golden-robed man and Dao Xuanji’s back. A trace of disgust flashed in his eyes.</p><p>“How off-putting.”</p><p>“What?” Elder Yu dug his ears again, but he still couldn’t hear it clearly.</p><p>“It’s nothing.”</p><p>“Don’t do anything rash. Speaking of which, why did you come out of the mountain? Were you commanded to deal with the ghost beast that appeared?”</p><p>Fang Wenxin didn’t say anything more.</p><p>“Well, makes sense. Yue Gongli is missing, and the red-clothed people are short-handed. If anything, you, the ‘Ruler’ in name, will be asked to step up,” Elder Yu answered his own question, feeling very happy.</p><p>Soon, the golden-robed man from the Judicial Division finished listing Dao Qiongcang’s crimes on Abyss Island.</p><p>After a pause, he continued, “The above 18 sins justify the removal of the sinner Dao Qiongcang from his position and his exile to the Dead Sea.”</p><p>“Despite the Council of Ten’s hopes that he would turn over a new leaf, Dao Qiongcang, the sinner, neglected his duties in the Heavenly Group operation. He’s also suspected of colluding with the dark forces.”</p><p>The verdict caused the audience to break into a commotion.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang remained motionless as the golden-robed man indifferently announced his sins.</p><p>“I will now list the crimes as follows.”</p><p>“First, despite the heinous crimes repeatedly committed by members of the dark forces such as the white-clothed people, the Ten High Nobles, XIang Yaoyao, and so on, he has not once returned to Sacred Mountain, causing a large number of casualties among the members of the Heavenly Group. The number of casualties is still rising.”</p><p>“Second, he broke the agreement and created a rift between alliance members. The Holy Palace of the four-hill Mountain is detached from the outside world and has the same status as the Holy Divine Palace. However, he abused his power and repeatedly crossed boundaries, causing demi-saint Wei An to be in danger and the headquarters of the Holy Palace in four-hill Mountain to be in turmoil.”</p><p>“Third, he ignored the rules and disregarded the lives of people. He used the Four Symbols Secret Realm as a pawn, ignored the big picture, and caused countless casualties among the talents of the five regions, resulting in the Holy Palace Trial cultivators complaining.”</p><p>“Fourth, he withheld information and acted recklessly. Knowing that the appearance of the godslayer ruins is harmful, he still acted willfully and schemed, causing all the Saints on the Sacred Mountain to disappear.”</p><p>“Fifth, he colluded with the ghost beasts to harm the continent…”</p><p>The ones in front were still alright. Everyone seemed to be numb to hearing it.</p><p>The news of the suspected failure of Hallmaster Dao’s Heavenly Group operation had already spread like wildfire. Now that it was explicitly verbalised, the disappointment was even greater.</p><p>However, when the collusion with the ghost beasts came out, everyone fell silent.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
