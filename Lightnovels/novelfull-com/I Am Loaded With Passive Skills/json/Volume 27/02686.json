There was only goodwill on his his face. He acknowledged this young friend despite their age difference.</p><p>“Dean… demi-saint Ye’s is at most seventy to eighty percent, not one hundred percent. It’s not perfect!” The second true body pointed at the Spatial Upanishad array diagram as he uttered this shocking statement.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian frowned when he heard that.</p><p>He turned his back on Fang Wenxin and pushed him away with his butt as he glared at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>They were all geniuses.</p><p>They were all studious people.</p><p>They were all top-notch existences that stood out from the crowd. Who could endure this sort of humiliation from others?</p><p>“Kid, you really dare to talk so arrogantly. Do you know how hard it was for me to cultivate this Spatial Upanishad?” Ye Xiaotian had been displeased with Xu Xiaoshou for a long time already.</p><p>Behind him, Fang Wenxin was stunned when he was shoved aside by his butt.</p><p>He looked at Ye Xiaotian, who was about to start cursing, then at Elder Zhong and Xu Xiaoshou. Then he seemed to have regained his senses.</p><p>After that, he fell into the same dazed state as Xi.</p><p>How dare he…</p><p>What happened here…</p><p>Elder Yu didn’t mind the commotion and completely blended in. He rode on someone’s back and said excitedly. “Go on, Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>The second true body turned and the Space Dao Disc spun away the person beside him. At the same time, it brought Master Siren in.</p><p>Mei Siren was stunned. He was now the center of everyone’s attention!</p><p>A laboratory rat?</p><p>“This person is an ancient sword saint, an expert in the Heart Sword Technique, and the controller of the Wisdom is Emptiness…” The second true body pointed at Master Siren and introduced him before he said.</p><p>“My Teacher also knows the Power Upanishad Formation. Although it is the Power Upanishad Formation for the Ancient Sword Technique, they are very similar to the Spiritual Cultivation.”</p><p>“There is no end to the path of Spiritual Cultivation, but there is an end for the Ancient Sword Technique. The Sword God Gu Louying is an example, right?”</p><p>Everyone nodded vigorously.</p><p>Even Fang Wenxin was drawn to this example.</p><p>After all, he was also a Spiritual Cultivator. To be able to become a demi-saint meant that all of them were talented and eager to learn, and all of them were very interested in the Great Path Diagram.</p><p>Xi looked at Master Siren, who had become a lab rat, and then shifted his gaze back to observe Xu Xiaoshou from afar.</p><p>This was the first time he had observed his peer at such a close distance and in a non-hostile manner.</p><p>He had to admit that he had more charm than himself!</p><p>He dared to speak freely among the group of demi-saints and even dared to question Elder Zhong…</p><p>“My Teacher is a genius, but do you dare to say that he had reached the end of the Heart Sword Technique just because he had cultivated the Heart Sword Technique, the Wisdom is Emptiness? No!”</p><p>“There are Eighteen Sword Forms in the Ancient Sword Technique, but only the emotion sword technique has a third realm. Was it because the other sword techniques shouldn’t have one? That’s not the case!”</p><p>“You must be extremely stupid to think that you’ve completed the path of a 100% Spiritual Cultivation just because you’ve created a Power Upanishad Formation!”</p><p>Xi watched as Xu Xiaoshou looked down at the group of people and berated them. For the first time, he felt the strong psychological impact of his peer.</p><p>“The reason why the emotion sword technique has a third realm is because the Sword God cultivated the Nine Major Sword Techniques and eventually became the ancestor of this sword technique!”</p><p>“This doesn’t mean that there are no other sword techniques that have reached the third realm. If my Teacher can become a god and be called the ancestor of the Wisdom is Emptiness, he will have another name, another sword flow!”</p><p>Xi’s body trembled.</p><p>Mei Siren’s pupils also trembled, and the path energy began to circulate around his body.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not stop there. His loud shouts were deafening and thought-provoking.</p><p>“Once the Spatial Upanishad has been cultivated to a 100%, then my demi-saint Ye, will not be the demi-saint of the Upanishad but a Holy Emperor. He would have become a god and an ancestor!”</p><p>“From the looks of it, not even Water Ghost, not even Senior Ye, has reached the end of the Spiritual Cultivation path.”</p><p>“So, Zhong Yuanzi, you are wrong!”</p><p>“The Great Path Diagram may be widely available in the Spiritual Cultivation world, but if your concept is wrong, the whole world will get it wrong!”</p><p>“Your path has yet to be made clear and you dare to jump to conclusions. Then you will be a sinner in the Shengshen Continent in the future!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
