After it scanned the surroundings, it finally flexed its claws and laid back against the Ancestral Tree.</p><p>Once again, it had that premonition…</p><p>A great disaster was about to happen!</p><p>The last time the Apricot Realm was in danger, it was due to the invasion of the Holy Emperor Bei Huai. Fortunately, Xu Xiao was able to turn the situation around and the crisis was resolved.</p><p>This time, the Spirit of Dragon Apricot felt very restless.</p><p>This sudden whim of premonition indicated that this disaster would not be any weaker than the previous one…</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot called out the true name of the Master of the Apricot Realm softly.</p><p>In the Crystal Palace, Greedy the Cat Spirit was still refining the Elixirs. It refined the vitality spiritual energy emitted from its owner into Elixirs and then fed them back to its owner and its female owner.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit looked up and lifted its paws to indicate that its owner was not awake.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s face was rosy and his aura was full. It was as if he could wake up at any time.</p><p>But…</p><p>He had been in this state for quite a long time already.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had not woken up yet and the Spirit of Dragon Apricot also knew the reason-he had used up too much energy!</p><p>The battle with the Holy Emperor had drained him completely.</p><p>Whether it was his body, soul, or spiritual will.</p><p>With Xu Xiaoshou’s foundation, he could quickly recover his physical strength after he had over exhausted himself.</p><p>However, when one reached a full state, it did not mean that one could wake up instantly. There was also a possibility that one could become…</p><p>A vegetable!</p><p>“The soul is lost, the will is wandering…”</p><p>“A dream is like reality, one would wake up from a dream…”</p><p>There were too many possibilities, and each one was more terrifying than the last.</p><p>Perhaps Xu Xiaoshou had planned it well, even the timing was accurate and everything had been taken into account.</p><p>But man’s plan is not as good as God’s plan.</p><p>Sometimes accidents would happen, and no one knew when it would occur.</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot had lived for so long and had seen many similar cases.</p><p>Among them, there were geniuses who were even more talented than Xu Xiaoshou. There were even those who were at the level of the Ten Ancestors, and had lost the battle.</p><p>So…</p><p>Perhaps Xu Xiaoshou would wake up soon.</p><p>Then again, he might only return after a thousand years.</p><p>Everything was possible!</p><p>This was one of the reasons why the Spirit of Dragon Apricot was extremely timid. It only wanted to continue living and witness history taking place, and did not want to fight.</p><p>Once the battle began, the Ancestral Tree would change its name-the Spirit of Dragon Apricot had even thought of this possibility!</p><p>“Weng…”</p><p>Not long after.</p><p>Just after Xu Xiaoshou’s second true body died and a large number of portrait clones in the Apricot Realm disappeared as well.</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot received an entry request.</p><p>Someone had crushed the Apricot Realm jade talisman in the outside world and wanted to enter.</p><p>This situation was not unfamiliar. The Spirit of Dragon Apricot had received these requests many times. It received the signal as usual, but it subconsciously took precautions.</p><p>It would first look at the person before it decided whether to let him in.</p><p>Its saint’s will took a look and the image of the person who crushed the jade talisman was imprinted in its mind. The Spirit of Dragon Apricot was relieved.</p><p>“Zhu Yike…”</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot recognized this person.</p><p>He was a member of the First Pavilion in the Sky. He had come here to recuperate during the Abyss Island period.</p><p>During the operation, Xu Xiaoshou had even taken the initiative to tell him that if this person applied to enter the Apricot Realm, he had to be allowed in.</p><p>Because he was busy with work, the situation might be critical. If he was late, he might not have long to live.</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>It raised its dragon claw.</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot opened the spatial passageway.</p><p>At the same time, it saw the human Zhu Yike’s crooked teeth as he revealed a devout and respectful smile.</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot was delighted.</p><p>It actually enjoyed the respect that Li Fugui, Zhu Yike, and Xu Xiaoshou, had for it.</p><p>This was one of the few pleasures it had in its life.</p><p>When Zhu Yike stepped into the spatial passageway, the Spirit of Dragon Apricot was about to open its mouth and say, “Human, welcome to the Apricot Realm…”</p><p>Suddenly, the Spirit of Dragon Apricot seemed to be struck by a thunderbolt.</p><p>“Disaster Descender!”</p><p>Just now, it had a sudden whim of premonition that the Apricot Realm was in trouble.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, someone had applied to enter the Apricot Realm, and it had not noticed at all. It had not even thought of it and was about to let the person in…</p><p>There was no doubt that someone had used the power of guidance to influence it and wanted to sneak into the Apricot Realm!</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>It was not too late to make amendments.</p><p>Just as the person was about to enter the Apricot Realm, the Spirit of Dragon Apricot shattered the spatial passageway.</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>An intangible storm descended.</p><p>Once the spatial passageway shattered, what welcomed the Disaster Descender were spatial fragments and even time fragments.</p><p>But…</p><p>It was the key step!</p><p>Just as Zhu Yike was about to be swallowed by the spacetime fragments, he slowly extended his jade-white hands.</p><p>“Let me in, Dragon Apricot Senior, I’m about to die…”</p><p>He let out a pleading cry, but there was still a smile on his face. At the same time, he grabbed a wisp of energy movement from the Apricot Realm!</p><p>He wanted to rely on brute force to enter the Apricot Realm?</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot was frightened.</p><p>This scene wasn’t as terrifying as when Bei Hua from the white-clothed people extended his divine soul hands that forcefully explored the Apricot Realm.</p><p>It was even more terrifying!</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot knew how weak Zhu Yike was, so how was he able to do this?</p><p>“Transform!”</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot erupted.</p><p>In an instant, the Ancestral Tree in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer flashed with a golden light. Even Greedy the Cat Spirit was attracted by its brilliance.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
