It could almost fit a small wild boar cub!</p><p>Against the backdrop of the ferocious sword image, the old immortal no longer had the slightest bit of his previous kind appearance.</p><p>He was like a sharp sword that had been unsheathed.</p><p>Even Cao Erzhu felt that it was highly possible that he would slash through the sky with his sword.</p><p>However, at this moment, what surprised him was not only the huge contrast between the before and after of the old immortal Mei, but also the sword image itself!</p><p>This sword image looked mysterious and invincible, but it also seemed extremely unreachable…</p><p>However, it seemed that he knew the nature of this thing’s power composition?</p><p>The answer was in his head?</p><p>“Isn’t it one of the six Transformation of the Penetrating Divine Senses, the release type?”</p><p>At this point, Cao Erzhu was completely stunned.</p><p>He seriously analyzed the power structure of the sword image from the inside out and found that it seemed to be just as he had imagined…</p><p>It was a very simple Penetrating Divine Senses!</p><p>His father was right. Everyone in the Spiritual Cultivation world was a master.</p><p>Cao Erzhu had not entered the Spiritual Cultivation world yet, but he had already seen the Penetrating Divine Senses twice on Qingyuan Mountain. It was from the old man and August.</p><p>Their Penetrating Divine Senses were also the release type. It manifested in the form of a sword cognition that could leave the body and had extremely high penetrating and cutting power.</p><p>This was a manifestation of the divine Penetrating Divine Senses, where the offensive attributes were pushed to the extreme.</p><p>The way the old immortal Mei used it was different.</p><p>He paid attention to the all-round development. He embodied the Nine Major Sword Techniques of the Ancient Sword Technique when he completely comprehended the attack, defense, speed, transformation, and cunning of his Penetrating Divine Senses. In other aspects, it developed in a balanced manner.</p><p>This kind of Penetrating Divine Senses that made the imagery materialize and then released it, basically had no shortcomings.</p><p>He could attack when he advanced and defended while he retreated. His only goal was to be stable and it was very divine.</p><p>Naturally, this Penetrating Divine Senses was not as powerful as the sword cognition when it came to attacks of the same level.</p><p>But why use an egg to hit a stone, and use the weak to hit the strong?</p><p>When the sword image was united, it was hard for the sword cognition to gain any advantage from the sword image.</p><p>However, the sword image was not stronger because of this. If it wanted to break the attack of the sword cognition, it would have to depend on the cultivation level of the owner of the sword cognition.</p><p>Overall, they were evenly matched!</p><p>Of course, this was what Cao Erzhu thought.</p><p>The founder of the Penetrating Divine Senses, his father, once gave such an evaluation:</p><p>“The Penetrating Divine Senses that materialized through the imagery is even more difficult to operate because it requires a very strong foundation.”</p><p>“However, its concept is higher, and its upper limit is also higher than the ultimate condensed attack of the Penetrating Divine Senses.”</p><p>“However, this also means that it is more difficult to cultivate. Therefore, under the same time and conditions, it will depend on the cultivator himself to determine the victory or failure of the two kinds of Penetrating Divine Senses.”</p><p>Cao Erzhu naturally learned both.</p><p>Time?</p><p>The Penetrating Divine Senses had only been around for a few decades.</p><p>What Cao Erzhu lacked the least was time. His age was a representation of how many years it had taken his Penetrating Divine Senses to develop at such a rapid rate.</p><p>He had also tried to comprehend sword cognition under the guidance of the old man.</p><p>However, due to the lack of a foundation in the Ancient Sword Technique, he could not comprehend the sword cognition no matter what.</p><p>It didn’t matter, Cao Erzhu had the God Punishment Tribulation.</p><p>His Penetrating Divine Senses could basically simulate the effects of the sword cognition.</p><p>The old immortal Mei’s sword image was similar to the God Punishment Tribulation that his father had taught him. It was called the God Firmament Leader Path!.</p><p>The same type of imagery materialized and was released…</p><p>His father had said that this could be used as a trump card because no one in the world had ever seen such a form of the Penetrating Divine Senses.</p><p>Today, Cao Erzhu saw the replacement for the unborn God Firmament Leader Path!</p><p>He fell silent.</p><p>His father was still too conservative.</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivation World wasn’t just about the ‘dragon and phoenix contention’.</p><p>Before they even left Qingyuan Mountain, the third possessor of the Penetrating Divine Senses had already emerged.</p><p>If he were to step into the Spiritual Cultivation world, wouldn’t he be slapped in the face by the all-encompassing Penetrating Divine Senses? Wouldn’t he be beaten black and blue and lose all his teeth at the same time?</p><p>Above the Nine Heavens.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang himself was also shocked by Mei Siren’s fury and the sword image that emerged.</p><p>He did not have any intention to have a head-on fight to the death with this old sword saint. This didn’t conform to the Divine Sorcerer’s backstabbing philosophy.</p><p>His original intention was to use reason to convince people and then suppress the other party’s aura first.</p><p>Who would have thought that Mei Siren wouldn’t reason with him at all and only wanted to get physical with him.</p><p>The bigger the fist, the harder it was!</p><p>“Nothing to say?”</p><p>Mei Siren’s sword image appeared and did not even give Dao Qiongcang time to speak. The Taicheng Sword in his hand slashed down. “Then there’s no need to say anything!”</p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p>The void was torn apart. The Azure Mo Swords in the sword image’s hand slashed down with the same form and posture, as if it wanted to split the entire Qingyuan Mountain into two.</p><p>“Wait…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s hand that held the divine Sinan trembled, but how could Mei Siren stop?</p><p>He was here to vent his anger!</p><p>He was here to express his stance!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had a lot of people backing him up. There was his master, Elder Sang, and Bazhun’an who was his guide. There was also the Holy Emperor of Abyss Island…</p><p>It could be said that he had a lot of support.</p><p>However, without exception, these people found it difficult to show themselves and were hindered in every way.</p><p>The Holy Divine Palace took advantage of this to target them.</p><p>However, Mei Siren was different.</p><p>He was all alone. He could roam the world if he wanted to, and he could draw his sword if he wanted to!</p><p>He had nothing to lose.</p><p>He, Mei Siren, walked to Qingyuan with his sword tonight. Everything else was just an excuse. His main purpose was to tell the Holy Divine Palace and Dao Qiongcang…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
