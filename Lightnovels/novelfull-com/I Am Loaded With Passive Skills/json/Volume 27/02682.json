Suddenly, his figure flashed and disappeared.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The second true body’s eyes trembled, and Zhong Yuanzi’s figure appeared in front of him.</p><p>What are you doing?</p><p>He didn’t even stop to think and struck out.</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi acted as if he did not see anything and excitedly grasped the young man’s palm with both hands.</p><p>A terrifying force that did not resemble anything human attacked!</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi only reacted subconsciously. His body twisted and swayed a few times like a snake, and then he lost all his strength.</p><p>He still held on to the young man’s hand and pointed to the disappearing Spatial Upanishad array diagram. He said.</p><p>“Little friend, what was that just now?”</p><p>Who was this player?</p><p>The second true body was stunned.</p><p>He watched helplessly as Elder Zhong Yuanzi’s palms bled, but he did not seem to care. Instead, he excitedly tried to delve into other people’s secrets. The Great Dao Disc was a supreme secret!</p><p>This demi-saint player whose combat strength and personality were unknown, was an enemy. He actually grasped his hands…</p><p>The second true body cherished his life too much and didn’t dare to communicate with him.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>A beam of golden light erupted from his body.</p><p>With a boom, the Exploding Posture blasted Zhong Yuanzi’s hands away and left him exposed.</p><p>His palms formed a fist, his sleeves were withered and his hands were scorched.</p><p>Without any hesitation, he used the Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand that simplified the process that reduced his sleeves and the Path Principles into ashes. Then, he directly smashed it towards Zhong Yuanzi’s chest.</p><p>“Tsk!”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi had clearly lost control of his body for a short while, but when he was about to strike, a snowstorm suddenly descended and transformed into a human figure behind the young man.</p><p>“You don’t have the Upanishad, right?”</p><p>“That was not a Upanishad; it was just a form of Upanishad, right?”</p><p>“Who taught you that? Or…”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi was like a child who had seen his favorite toy. He slapped the young man’s shoulder again. “Elder Yu said that you are like one of the Ten High Nobles. Did you comprehend it yourself?”</p><p>Snow attribute…</p><p>This was really a big boss. He could freely switch between the corresponding attributes during wartime according to the weather and place?</p><p>Also, what kind of attribute was that creeping force dissipation just now? Or was it a spiritual technique?</p><p>The second true body had never encountered such a strange person in his entire life. He did not dare to slack off at all. After he took the easy way out, he lowered his shoulders and slipped out of the control. Then, he passed behind Zhong Yuanzi…</p><p>“Whoa!”</p><p>At the Southern Zone gate, the wind and snow stopped slightly.</p><p>At this moment, Zhong Yuanzi temporarily forgot what he wanted to say and why he stood beside the ghost beast.</p><p>The name Xu Xiaoshou was forcibly erased from Ye Xiaotian and Mei Siren’s vision and memories.</p><p>Elder Yu and Fang Wenxin lost their focus and forgot about the key enemy in this brief confrontation.</p><p>The two of them were old hands on the battlefield and they soon realized that something was wrong.</p><p>“Elder Zhong, be careful!”</p><p>“Brother Zhong, watch your back!”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi felt a chill run down his spine. He turned around abruptly and saw a strange young man appear behind him.</p><p>He stepped on the fire-type Great Path Diagram that he had studied for a long time and used the Penetrating Divine Senses of the Sleeveless Saint Servant.</p><p>For some reason, he seemed to be very hostile towards him?</p><p>“You, you, you…”</p><p>His stutter ended.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>A Sleeveless scarlet-scorched hand punched through his heart.</p><p>Before Zhong Yuanzi could react to what had happened, the pain in his chest filled his mind. He raised his head and spat out a fine mist of blood.</p><p>The osmanthus tree turned white and a film of red gauze covered the sky.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>The second true body frowned and ended his Independence in time.</p><p>He didn’t understand the situation, so he didn’t dare to make any fatal moves. He only remembered that Elder Sang had taught him that the Absolute Power could penetrate the Element Body. Therefore, after he pulled out the Sleeveless Red Scorched Hand, he turned around and charged up his power again.</p><p>“Exploding Posture!”</p><p>Rays of golden light erupted as a whip kick struck his chest and hit the wound.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi fell apart, but his body was still connected. The Holy Power actually gathered the pieces of flesh on his body together and hurled them towards the Southern Zone gate.</p><p>With a snap, the old man slammed against the plaque on the city wall, like a huge brush dipped in ink. As he slid down, he left a bloody mark on the city wall.</p><p>Thump.</p><p>After the figure slammed onto the ground.</p><p>The plaque exploded with another loud bang and his head was smashed into a pile of snow.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>When it saw the blood, Greedy the Cat Spirit went berserk. It managed to break free from the Blood Shadow copper coin’s restraint for a short while and flew over. It stuck out its long tongue and licked a big mouthful of the demi-saint’s blood that splattered all over the sky.</p><p>The second true body was no exception. After he secretly touched a drop, his brows remained tightly furrowed.</p><p>What kind of person was this? It felt strange…</p><p>The world fell silent!</p><p>Fang Wenxin and Elder Yu were not the only ones who held their breaths.</p><p>The spectators who crouched on the mountain in the distance stood up before they could even make a sound. Their eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>In just one exchange…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou punched through the chest and crippled the Elemental Divine Envoy from the Council of Ten?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
