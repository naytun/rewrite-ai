It seemed that he could no longer sense the spiritual energy in the outside world.</p><p>Under such circumstances, if he used the lightning-type Upanishad, he would probably use up all the spiritual source in his energy reserve and would not be able to continue.</p><p>“Star studded, Clear Spiritual Sky!”</p><p>It wasn’t over yet. When the voice sounded again, the Order of the Heavens also withdrew and left the Qingyuan Mountain great array.</p><p>Those escape techniques that relied on the Way of the Heavens, such as the Space- Time Transition, would be difficult to execute.</p><p>Unless he took a different path from the scope of the traditional escape techniques, like the Frost Ferret that had the Super Saint Escape Technique.</p><p>“Star studded, Spiritual Draw Sky!”</p><p>After this Transformation appeared, everyone within the Qingyuan Mountain great array felt that something seemed to have drained out of their bodies.</p><p>At first, it was spiritual energy.</p><p>Then, blood seeped out of their skin.</p><p>Soon, even their life force became unstable and was about to be sucked away.</p><p>At the Back Mountain waterfall, Yu Zhiwen, who had been ordered to face the wall to reflect on her mistakes, was shocked when she saw the Blood Pearl oozing from her hands.</p><p>Even the Spiritual Draw Sky had emerged; this indicated that Hallmaster Dao meant serious business!</p><p>He really wanted to rely on the Divine Secrets Array to kill everyone here!</p><p>That included Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>And even herself?</p><p>For the Spiritual Draw Sky, other than the person who controlled the great array, there was no distinction in the target. Even the wild spirits in the mountains would be swallowed, little by little!</p><p>“Star studded, Spiritual Protection Sky.”</p><p>A light sound rang in her ears. A ray of starlight that was large enough to accommodate a person descended from the sky and landed on a small stone pond a short distance away. It waited there in silence.</p><p>There was no way out!</p><p>Hallmaster Dao was forcing her to make a choice!</p><p>Would she be killed by the great array or would she survive among the stars?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s eyes showed signs of her struggle as she clenched her teeth tightly. She could feel the needle like pains all over her body.</p><p>She had only stood for a short while in the Qingyuan Mountain great array that was controlled by a demi-saint, but she had already been drained of blood!</p><p>If she continued to persevere, she would probably die on the way to the rescue before she even took two steps…</p><p>How could be this a ‘reinforcement’?</p><p>This was a suicide mission termed as ‘reinforcement’!</p><p>After she looked away, Yu Zhiwen took a deep breath and walked into the midst of the Spiritual Protection Sky with her head lowered. Only then did she feel the pain in her body dissipate.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>She muttered softly and sat down cross-legged. Her Pearl Gem Star Eyes opened wide.</p><p>Immediately, the path of the Divine Path Principles of the Qingyuan Mountain great array was no longer hidden. It slowly became visible.</p><p>Billions of divine threads crisscrossed crazily and outlined strange and mysterious pictures. They exerted a strange and magical effect that made people dizzy.</p><p>In less than an instant, tears and blood overflowed from Yu Zhiwen’s eyes.</p><p>This sort of intensity was too overwhelming!</p><p>It was not something that could be compared to the daily trials in the Path Division. This was actual combat!</p><p>“I can do it…”</p><p>“I can definitely do it!”</p><p>She opened her eyes wide and showed no fear.</p><p>“This is the great array that I created…”</p><p>“Just treat it as an ordinary trial and proceed calmly… That’s right! That’s it!”</p><p>“Full marks. I will definitely have a chance to snatch back the control of the Qingyuan Mountain great array from him!”</p><p>“And I…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was like a sponge that thirsted for water. She frantically memorized the way Hallmaster Dao controlled the Qingyuan Mountain great array. She memorized his habits, and deduced his next move.</p><p>The great array’s numerous Transformations were due to her repeated failures.</p><p>However, the reduction in the range of the displacement could also increase the probability of success.</p><p>Amid the flow of tears and blood, her Pearl Gem Star Eyes shone with an even brighter glow.</p><p>“I always get full marks!”</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>Mei Siren was stunned by the star studded Transformation that happened in the blink of an eye.</p><p>He had only shattered the Illusory Spiritual Heaven with a single sword strike, and Dao Qiongcang had cast god knew how many layers of the Divine Secret.</p><p>At this moment, all the spiritual paths had been stripped off from Qingyuan Mountain, and disasters occurred. It was like a small world that had been exiled.</p><p>Even Mei Siren couldn’t sense the slightest bit of energy movement from the outside world, and thus he broke the Divine Secrets Array from the outside to the inner level.</p><p>And attacked from the inside out…</p><p>After Dao Qiongcang’s backup plan was completed, his smile froze on his face. He then leisurely snapped his fingers.</p><p>“Star studded, Chaotic Spiritual Sky!”</p><p>With a bang, this Transformation emerged and the Qingyuan Mountain great array was thrown into chaos.</p><p>The mountain rocks crumbled and the gravity shifted.</p><p>Cao Erzhu only felt his body tilt as he fell towards the horizon… Yes, it ‘fell’!</p><p>The gravity shifted to the sky. He felt like he had fallen into an abyss. He felt weightless and fell into the sky!</p><p>What followed him were the rocks on the ground, the soil underground, the flowers, plants, and trees. There were also spiritual ores, corpses of animals and plants that had been buried deep underground…</p><p>Everything was in chaos!</p><p>Before Cao Erzhu could react, he slammed heavily against the huge bronze door in the sky.</p><p>The smell of earth that only existed deep underground filled his nose and mouth. Soon, he was buried by the soil and trees that were thrown at him.</p><p>“Brother Shou…”</p><p>Due to the Transformation in gravity, the array wheel in his hand had long been sucked to an unknown place.</p><p>Cao Erzhu panicked. He could not even protect a lump of iron. How was this possible?</p><p>“Godhood Punishment…”</p><p>With a thought.</p><p>However, the Penetrating Divine Senses did not emerge.</p><p>The spiritual source in his energy reserve surged and was pulled out of his body by an unknown force. It was so painful that Cao Erzhu’s thoughts were temporarily cut off. Naturally, he could not use any moves.</p><p>His arms were pulled apart with great force in both directions and his legs were about to give way. Even his head seemed to be uprooted and was nearly separated from his spine…</p><p>It was as if he was being torn apart by five horses!</p><p>Cao Erzhu spun about helter-skelter. The mud and rocks were out of control. again. He was about to be torn apart by the force of this gravity!</p><p>“What is this? Leave!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
