Since he couldn’t complete the Great God Descending Technique, he knew that Xu Xiaoshou’s incarnation had made a decisive move.</p><p>Everything was under his control!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang grasped the Divine Elf firmly and threw it at the Sky Sword that Mei Siren had slashed out of thin air.</p><p>“Buzz…”</p><p>Xiao Qi flew over in a purple electric arc and suddenly expanded in front of the sword.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Divine Elf also self-destructed.</p><p>The endless air waves that suddenly exploded temporarily stopped the force of the Sky Sword.</p><p>At this critical moment, the head of the array wheel had already fallen into Dao Qiongcang’s hands.</p><p>“Spiritual Protection Sky!”</p><p>The starlight descended.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang seemed to be very afraid that the spiritual senses in the array wheel’s head would die instantly because Xu Xiaoshou’s incarnation had self destructed. He took every precaution to protect it from the influence of the Spiritual Draw.</p><p>After that, he flicked his finger and a Divine Secret covered Xu Xiaoshou’s remnant thought.</p><p>“Great Protection Spell!”</p><p>In an instant, all the life force extracted by the Spiritual Draw was poured into the head of the array wheel.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang exerted all his strength and infused all his Holy Power as if everything was for Xu Xiaoshou’s good. He wanted him to live.</p><p>Jin Ren’s spiritual senses that was about to collapse due to the self-destruction of his body was also saved and delayed by these two moves.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang protected his spiritual senses!</p><p>However, no matter how strong the Great Protection Spell was, it was said to only be able to extend one’s life. At the very least, it could keep a dying person alive.</p><p>At this moment, he couldn’t stop the continuous disintegration of Jin Ren’s spiritual senses; it could delay it but it could not stop it.</p><p>“I am still alive?”</p><p>After its self-destruction, he was still conscious. It made Jin Ren feel happy for a short time, as if he had transmigrated.</p><p>In the next second, when he regained his senses, he realized that his original body was already dead. All he could see was the chaotic scene around Qingyuan Mountain…</p><p>He almost collapsed.</p><p>This was even more terrifying than death!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang controlled his spiritual senses?</p><p>“Junior, how dare you dare?!”</p><p>Mei Siren’s eyes were about to pop out.</p><p>He didn’t know what had happened.</p><p>However, what he sensed at this moment was Xu Xiaoshou’s remnant thought on the head of the array wheel that became increasingly weaker, like the rootless duckweed.</p><p>One could imagine that the owner of this remnant thought was already dead!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was gone…</p><p>“No more?”</p><p>Something seemed to explode in Mei Siren’s mind.</p><p>He no longer cared about the influence of the Spiritual Draw. He rushed out of the starlight, bit his tongue with his teeth, and spat out blood.</p><p>“Master Siren, wait!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was frightened and quickly waved his hand. “I only left a bit of him so he could say a few words. Xu Xiaoshou isn’t dead yet. Don’t be rash.”</p><p>Mei Siren did not care.</p><p>The sword image protected him as he rushed towards Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>Under the influence of the chaotic gravity of the Chaotic Spiritual Sky, red plum blossoms slowly floated down from the sky in all directions.</p><p>“Pa!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was shocked. He slapped the head of the array wheel hard. “Say something!”</p><p>Jin Ren realized that his remnant thought was fundamentally different from the Wangze Holy Emperor’s thought that was captured by Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison.</p><p>First, his main body died, but the Wangze Holy Emperor’s didn’t.</p><p>Secondly, the force of his remnant thought was difficult to control, and Dao Qiongcang was powerless to reverse it.</p><p>There was no need for Master Siren to risk his life at this time.</p><p>“Teacher, stop!” He shouted hurriedly. “Spare this Elder Dao’s dog life. I want to hear what else he wants to bark about!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s lips twitched.</p><p>Mei Siren frowned and stopped.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang hurriedly moved the starlight of the Spiritual Protection Sky to where Mei Siren was and continued to protect him.</p><p>Be good and don’t run out again…</p><p>I can’t take this sort of scare, I don’t want to exchange my life for a life…</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>Jin Ren realized that his days were numbered.</p><p>Perhaps when the main body produced another one, even his name Jin Ren would be taken away.</p><p>His memories were beginning to fade and disappear…</p><p>Dao Qiongcang took a deep breath and regained his composure. He looked at the array wheel in his hand and couldn’t help but smile. He said in a teasing tone.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, are you scared?”</p><p>Jin Ren discovered that his remnant thought couldn’t even transmit a telepathic communication.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had extended his life, but he was about to die!</p><p>He couldn’t speak, but Mei Siren couldn’t bear to hear these taunts. His eyes turned cold.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s heart skipped a beat and he quickly waved his hand to calm him down. He then looked back at the array wheel in his hand.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you have a lot of secrets…”</p><p>He sighed. He knew that the array wheel head couldn’t reply, so he said to himself.</p><p>“It’s still the same phrase. I’m keeping you alive so that you will have a clear understanding when you die.”</p><p>Mei Siren’s fingertips moved.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang immediately changed his words. “I want you, this incarnation, to die and understand.”</p><p>Everything that Jin Ren’s spiritual senses detected became even more blurry.</p><p>Even Dao Qiongcang’s face did not look as hateful as before.</p><p>Only Master Siren’s sadness and heartache were clearly transmitted through the turbid world.</p><p>He felt a slight relief.</p><p>Dying in this manner was worth it.</p><p>Master Siren was much more humane than the main body. He was even so concerned about an incarnation…</p><p>“You have a technique that’s similar to the Holy Emperor’s power of oblivion. It can even block my Perception, right?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s words were like a blow to his head prior to his death.</p><p>It was as if Jin Ren had regained some of his thoughts.</p><p>He was referring to…</p><p>The Independence?</p><p>That’s right, when he obtained the Collection of Excuses, he had used the Independence technique…</p><p>However, the effect of the Independence technique was to make people forget.</p><p>What kind of demon was Dao Qiongcang? How could he remember this matter after the incident?</p><p>Was this guy really a human?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
