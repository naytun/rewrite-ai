He did not even dare to struggle for a moment.</p><p>As a person who possessed three extreme physiques, he had many secrets.</p><p>This sort of person who would reveal his trump card if there was even the slightest chance, would have the means to revive.</p><p>Self-destruction was the most cost-effective choice!</p><p>Then again, the problem here…</p><p>How many secrets did Jin Ren have?</p><p>There were too many!</p><p>He and his main body were connected. Just the transmigration and passive skills alone were not something he dared to let Dao Qiongcang know.</p><p>The Great God Descending Technique seemed to be able to use the human body to descend to another location, but what if this was just one of the many abilities of the Great God Descending Technique?</p><p>What if Elder Dao the Flamboyant chose not to destroy the host body after he descended; instead he chose to possess the host body, read the memories, or even interfere with the will of the original body?</p><p>“Self-destruct!”</p><p>Jin Ren didn’t hesitate to use this final method of self-resistance.</p><p>He was deep underground in the Ran Ming ruins. When he saw the handshake pattern appear all over his body, he did not dare to delay any longer. He only sent this message through telepathic communication.</p><p>“Master Siren, quickly destroy the array wheel!”</p><p>Then…</p><p>His energy reserve exploded!</p><p>His spiritual source detonated!</p><p>His physical body, soul, and will exploded!</p><p>As if he had rehearsed it countless times, Jin Ren ignited himself in an orderly manner with great familiarity and completed the self-detonation in an instant.</p><p>This time, he was in such a hurry that he didn’t even have the time to leave behind a thought-provoking lament. It was as if he didn’t have any attachment for this world.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Somewhere in the Ran Ming ruins, the earth shook.</p><p>The terrifying waves of light were like a volcanic eruption that pushed away the rock layers deep underground and exploded into the sky.</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>The air current sent the passing Zhou Tianshen flying before he crashed onto the ground with a bang.</p><p>“Clang…”</p><p>The golden domineering blade fell to the ground.</p><p>A dazzling, multi-edged crystal that was the size of a human head rolled out as well. It shone with a colorful light.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>Zhou Tianshen was stunned for a moment. He quickly stood up and picked up the domineering blade and the God Fated Star at the same time.</p><p>Because of this item, he was now being hunted down by many people, and he almost lost his life.</p><p>However, he could still persevere!</p><p>“We have to wait until Xu Xiaoshou comes in…”</p><p>Zhou Tianshen did not even know the exact effect of the crystal in his hand.</p><p>He had already left the Tiansang Spirit Palace and established a sect, the Domineering Blade Style and the Blade Will Pishou Sect.</p><p>One day, when he was cultivating, he received guidance. He felt that his destiny had arrived, so he chanted the words ‘Ran Ming’.</p><p>He thought that he could obtain the inheritance just like that.</p><p>He did not expect that the people who fought with him for this inheritance were actually everyone from the five regions!</p><p>Although he was not the chosen one, which was a little disappointing, Zhou Tianshen’s luck was quite good.</p><p>After he entered the Ran Ming ruins, he saw this crystal by his feet and casually picked it up.</p><p>As a result, he became number one on the Ancestral God ranking list.</p><p>After that, he was pursued crazily!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, where are you?”</p><p>Zhou Tianshen felt a little bitter. He was a Master Stage. Even if he was able to break through, he would only be at the Sovereign Dao Realm.</p><p>However, the ones who pursued him were either the higher voids or the demi-saints.</p><p>Without the protection of the power from the Ran Ming ruins, he would have died.</p><p>So…</p><p>Zhou Tianshen panicked!</p><p>He knew that the God Fated Star in his hand was a good thing.</p><p>Rather than letting it fall into the hands of others, it would be better to wait for an opportunity. If Xu Xiaoshou entered the ruins, he could give it to him.</p><p>But he had waited for a very long time.</p><p>That sort of massive explosion was always an indication of big trouble.</p><p>This was an unprecedented event in the Ran Ming ruins, and his name was nowhere to be seen on the Ancestor God ranking list either.</p><p>“I can only use my real name. Moreover, I’ve already entered. He can’t steal my name anymore…”</p><p>“Could it be that even the name ‘Xu Xiaoshou’ is fake? Did he deceive me that time at the Spirit Palace?”</p><p>Zhou Tianshen did not understand.</p><p>The explosion disappeared, and the airflow was back to normal.</p><p>For some reason, Zhou Tianshen felt that the huge explosion that occurred before his eyes could have been caused by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>However, he soon dispelled this absurd idea.</p><p>Perhaps it was another treasure that had been unearthed from the Ran Ming ruins, but it had nothing to do with him. After all, for him to guard a God Fated Star was troublesome enough.</p><p>Zhou Tianshen did not dare to participate in the fight.</p><p>Before the treasure appeared, he ran away, afraid that the people behind him would catch up.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you’d better hurry up!”</p><p>“Master Siren, quickly destroy the array wheel!”</p><p>In the darkness, when the array wheel in his hand let out this hysterical roar, Mei Siren didn’t know what was going on, but he didn’t hesitate at all.</p><p>The sword energy erupted from his palm as he clenched it.</p><p>“Chaos!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang seemed to have expected this move as he smiled and shouted.</p><p>Instantly, the infinite gravity in the Chaotic Spiritual Sky seemed to gather completely around the head of the array wheel.</p><p>With a sizzle, the sword energy at Mei Siren’s fingertips was shattered, and even his palms were pierced through. Blood and flesh splattered everywhere.</p><p>The head of the array wheel that dropped at an accelerated speed, after it slipped from his grasp, was pulled towards Dao Qiongcang by the deviated gravity.</p><p>“Swordless Sword Form!”</p><p>Mei Siren controlled the virtual reality and formed a giant sword in the air. He used great force to slash at the head of the array wheel.</p><p>What Xu Xiaoshou had requested, Dao Qiongcang blocked it.</p><p>There must be a reason!</p><p>If the head of the array wheel died, his student might have a chance of survival. How could he let Dao Qiongcang succeed?</p><p>“Good swordsmanship!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
