You will awaken at the final stage!”</p><p>“Good, good. Senior Dragon Apricot, I feel so much at ease with what you just said. But now, I need to offend you a little, okay?”</p><p>“What do you want now?”</p><p>“Your acting is bad and Elder Dao can see through it at a single glance! What we’re talking about now is not for you to go along with the act. It’s for you to remember the plans we made when you wake up!”</p><p>“Wake up?”</p><p>“Yes. Later, I will get Greedy the Cat Spirit to control you and use the Three Loathsome Eyes on you so that you would forget all the plans we made. You must not resist and you need to cooperate fully or else it will be injured. And once you bring my main body out of the Apricot Realm, you will remember all the things that we spoke about.”</p><p>“Impossible! I am the Ancestral Tree, born from chaos and awakened by the blood of the Dragon Ancestor. How can I be a mere…”</p><p>“Very good. Then I’ll die in the hands of Elder Dao the Flamboyant, and you will become the nutrient of the God Worship Willow Tree. We’ll go and meet Huang… together… Uh, this stupid name. In short, it’s not a bad choice!”</p><p>“How about it, my noble Lord Ancestral Tree?”</p><p>“Alright then…”</p><p>“Okay, then later you must remember not to resist. In short, what I said has nothing to do with your encounter with Elder Dao the Flamboyant. You won’t be aware of anything. Just follow his plan and go with the flow.”</p><p>“I still have a question.”</p><p>“Senior Dragon Apricot, please speak.”</p><p>“If my memory was erased and that Dao person accidentally barged into the Apricot Realm; I can’t remember the plan, so I will fight with all my might to protect your main body…”</p><p>“Hahahaha!”</p><p>“What are you laughing about!!!?”</p><p>“I’m sorry, Senior Dragon Apricot. I usually can’t help myself. My apologies, so sorry…”</p><p>“You must give me an explanation today!”</p><p>“Senior, your question is really deep-rooted. Let me think about what to say… Cough cough, let me put it this way. Do you think I’m more scheming than that Elder Dao the Flamboyant? After all, you’ve seen all the images that were shared with you.”</p><p>“It can barely be considered to be on par…”</p><p>“Senior, you don’t have to hide anything. You can be more direct.”</p><p>“He is ten times better than you!”</p><p>“Uh, then you still believe in me?”</p><p>“I believe in the power of guidance of the blood tree. It’s number one in the continent. Its curse can disrupt the will of the Path, and you… Your good fortune is not exhausted yet, do you still have a variable?”</p><p>“In the end, you still don’t believe in me… Forget it, then I’ll ask Senior again. How is your scheming compared to mine?”</p><p>“No… there’s no comparison, we’re evenly matched.”</p><p>“Good, very good. A tie is fine too! In that case, do you think that when Elder Dao the Flamboyant barges into the Apricot Realm, will he be able to persuade a great Buddha like you to leave the Apricot Realm?”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“Alright, that’s all for now. Senior, do you have any other questions?”</p><p>“No…”</p><p>“Alright, I’ll ask the Greedy the Cat Spirit to perform the procedure on you later.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“You humiliated me. If you can survive this tribulation, I will settle this score later. However, you must know…”</p><p>“Know what?”</p><p>“I will defend the Apricot Realm to the death!”</p><p>“Hahaha, good! Senior’s aspiration will shock the Heavens and the earth and make the Gods and ghosts weep… How about we make a bet?”</p><p>After the bet, in the Crystal Palace.</p><p>“Greedy the Cat Spirit, I’m sorry.”</p><p>“Meow?”</p><p>“You can raise a cat for a thousand days, but you use it only for a moment… I’m about to die, but whether we can win this battle will depend on your performance, Greedy the Cat Spirit. Your role is very vital, do you understand?”</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>“After I die, all the portrait clones in the Apricot Realm will die immediately; this includes me, the one talking to you now. And when you see this change, remember to use the Three Loathsome Eyes to control me…”</p><p>“Woo…”</p><p>“Don’t be sad, I am not completely dead yet! At that time, you will have to control my main body and let me use my second true body to split into another Jin Ren… Remember, you have to work fast. Use your fastest speed. If you really can’t do it, ask Senior Dragon Apricot for help!”</p><p>“Meow?”</p><p>“Very good, you understand now, right? Next, you need to hand over my sleeping main body to Senior Dragon Apricot, then use the Three Loathsome Eyes to erase Senior Dragon Apricot’s memories and watch it abandon me. You have to remember this scene. This episode will be something it will remember for life. In the future, we can laugh at it. If there’s a future…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou! You haven’t won the bet yet!”</p><p>“Meow…”</p><p>“Are you confused? It was good that you understood! You are really a smart little cat. Remember, after you’re done, you have to put Jin Ren that you just split into this alchemy cauldron and refine him in the usual way. Everything will be the same as before.”</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>“I see… Xu Xiaoshou… No! Humans are truly sinister!”</p><p>“Next, it’s time to let you down. When Elder Dao the Flamboyant enters the Apricot Realm, there’s a high chance that he’ll invite Senior Dragon Apricot to leave. My main body will also leave with him, but if everyone agreed to leave, he won’t believe it.”</p><p>“Woo…”</p><p>“Yes, you have to stay and hang on for a bit. Don’t worry, Senior Dragon Apricot will leave you with a life-saving method. After all, it escaped shamelessly before.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“You will, right? Senior Dragon Apricot? You will leave a protective talisman for Greedy the Cat Spirit, right?”</p><p>“Humph!”</p><p>“Very good, Senior Dragon Apricot has agreed… Look carefully, this is the Apricot Realm jade talisman. The coordinates are bound to Qingyuan Mountain. Swallow it first. When you can’t hold on anymore, you can escape from the Apricot Realm. Senior Dragon Apricot will be the first to come to your aid in the outside world. And before that, you can at least wait for a warm-hearted old man who will definitely help you…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
