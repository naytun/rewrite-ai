The Nine Great Ancestral Trees were born from the chaos and are rare treasures in the world. After Elder Dao the Flamboyant enters the Apricot Realm, his first task would definitely not be to destroy you. He doesn’t have the ability to do so. There’s a high chance that he will use emotion and reason to persuade you to move to the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe. Do you think you will agree?”</p><p>“That’s impossible. The Sacred Mountain already has the God Worship Willow Tree and the Nine Sacrificial Osmanthus.”</p><p>“What if the Nine Sacrificial Osmanthus is willing to share the guardian duties of the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe with you. What if it agreed to let you be the master so both of you can share the fate of the Sacred Mountain?”</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>“What if Elder Dao the Flamboyant can promise more benefits that even I can’t think of? The kind that you would definitely be tempted by. He can think of far more than I can.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, there’s no need for you to put me to the test. You and I are already bound by the World Tree and the Lord of the World. We are inseparable and I will never be tempted.”</p><p>“I would prefer that you are tempted!”</p><p>“Oh? Why?”</p><p>“If you are not tempted, how do you plan to deal with it? Fight to the death and protect my main body?”</p><p>“Can you protect it?”</p><p>“I will definitely not let him enter the Apricot Realm!”</p><p>“No, No! No! Senior Dragon Apricot, you are avoiding the question… At the end of the day, you dare to underestimate Elder Dao the Flamboyant still!”</p><p>“This guy has calculated my every move from the beginning to the end. I’m afraid that even if you don’t want to let him through, he will have a way to sneak in… His target is my main body. Since he wants to kill my second true body, he definitely will find a way to enter the Apricot Realm. Even I don’t know how he will get in…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you’re boosting the ambitions of others and destroying your own prestige.”</p><p>“Bullsh*t! I am well aware of my own strength. I’ve just experienced how scheming Elder Dao the Flamboyant is. I’m almost being played to death!”</p><p>“Uh, then what do you think we should do?”</p><p>“Like I said, I’d rather that you were tempted!”</p><p>“The reason?”</p><p>“No matter what Elder Dao the Flamboyant’s plans are, he will never be willing to have an all out fight with you. When he enters the Apricot Realm, he will definitely cook up a plan to lure you away from the mountain. He will either ask you to leave, abduct you, or somehow trick you into leaving the Apricot Realm. He will ignore the life and death situation of my main body so that he can move about freely.”</p><p>“Do I have to obey his wishes?”</p><p>“No, you have to resist, you have to put up a struggle initially! If you agree to it immediately, with his scheming mind, he will definitely smell a rat!”</p><p>“Human…”</p><p>“Yes, the human heart is so complicated. I also hate that Elder Dao. He’s really disgusting! However, I’m even more afraid that I had miscalculated…”</p><p>“After I’ve entered the Sacred Mountain, how can I return?”</p><p>“Senior Dragon Apricot, are you joking? Why do you still dare to think about your return? This is not even something that can be described as ‘one mountain can’t accommodate two tigers’!”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“How can you allow others to invade your sphere of influence? If you really enter the Sacred Mountain, wouldn’t you be sucked dry by the Nine Sacrificial Osmanthus and the God Worship Willow Tree? I heard that the head of the Nine Great Ancestral Trees, the God Worship Willow Tree, is still in a half-dead state after being slashed by You Tu’s sword. What do you think it lacked the most now?”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>“It’s good that you know! You can’t go to the Sacred Mountain at all!”</p><p>“You told me to go and you’re also discouraging me from going. Xu Xiaoshou, what tricks are you up to…”</p><p>“No, no, no! Elder Dao the Flamboyant’s goal is to get you to leave the Apricot Realm and squander a lot of time before you reach the Sacred Mountain. There are many connections in between.”</p><p>“Humph! Speak!”</p><p>“At that time, you will bring my main body out of the Apricot Realm and land anywhere you want… Hmm, actually not just anywhere. How about this, you will first go to Changde Town and look for Kui Leihan!”</p><p>“That person is already dead. You’ve already said it.”</p><p>“Kui Leihan is definitely not dead! He dismissed us previously because he was clearly afraid of something. What Er Zhu saw might just be an illusion…”</p><p>“After I look for him?”</p><p>“We’ll talk about it when we can find it… My main body is on the brink of awakening. I can feel that my consciousness is about to seep into my body bit by bit, but it’s very slow. Perhaps, I need a stimulation…”</p><p>“Stimulation?”</p><p>“Yes, perhaps my main body will be stimulated by Dao Qiongcang’s arrival before I look for Kui Leihan. After all, this guy is disgusting enough, and the effect is great! If it really doesn’t work out, I’ll have to settle for the second best option and choose to get electrocuted…”</p><p>“Wait! At this moment, shouldn’t your main body have already left the Apricot Realm?”</p><p>“Senior Dragon Apricot…”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“I don’t have time to explain to you. If you trust me, just do as I say.”</p><p>“Heh, human!”</p><p>“Yes, I’m also very filthy. If you want to scold me, go ahead. At least living a filthy life is much better than dying a lowly death. This is the most tiring battle I’ve ever had.”</p><p>“How confident are you?”</p><p>“Less than ten percent.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“This is Dao Qiongcang we’re talking about! Perhaps he can even predict what my plan is…”</p><p>“Then…”</p><p>“I can only pray to the Heavens… No, for the protection of the Blood World Pearl! I hope that Elder Dao will take his time to retaliate…”</p><p>“Hu! Then what are the chances of your main body waking up on time?”</p><p>“Less than ten percent.”</p><p>“You can’t be serious?”</p><p>“I can only pray that Bazhun’an is not just standing by and watching. If it really came to that, I’ll die instantly for him to see.”</p><p>“Senior Dragon Apricot, what kind of expression is that?”</p><p>“I was just joking. Don’t give up yet. I’m actually very confident!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, your good fortune has yet to arrive.”</p><p>“Ah… Everything happened so abruptly…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
