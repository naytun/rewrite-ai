His exposed skin was very fair and delicate.</p><p>Jin Feng’s spear had sent him flying and he suffered some injuries from the residual force.</p><p>However, what really exploded was only a gold bead accessory on Elder Dao the Flamboyant’s belt. There was no real damage caused.</p><p>“The Five Decays of Heaven and Man, is he on good terms with you?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang landed on the mountain and asked him coldly.</p><p>At this moment, he could no longer see any of the white-clothed people who belonged to the Holy Divine Palace around him.</p><p>The last three who seemed to have escaped death were actually controlled by the command attribute.</p><p>In the end, they were used by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man as tools and died tragically at the hands of Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>This was not a minor loss!</p><p>If it had been Gou Wuyue who gained a little after the battle, even if he lost an arm, it would not have been enough to make up for this huge mistake!</p><p>On the ground, Zhu Yike didn’t know what was going on in the outside world. He only felt that he was in a nightmare.</p><p>In this nightmare, he had been kicked a few times and chased by countless unknown evil spirits. He had broken out in cold sweat and fallen into an abyss.</p><p>Just as he wanted to fly upwards, he realized that his spiritual source was completely gone. Dao Qiongcang even came out and smiled at him.</p><p>Zhu Yike was so frightened that he thrashed about and woke up. Then he saw Hallmaster Dao, who had an extremely cold expression.</p><p>Zhu Yike didn’t know what had taken place in Qingyuan Mountain while he was unconscious.</p><p>However, Hallmaster Dao’s previous amicable attitude, where he had wanted to have a chat with Lord Shou seemed to have changed. He stared coldly at them now.</p><p>“I don’t know!” Zhu Yike tilted his head and looked at the remains of the Divine Puppet. Lord Shou’s tone was filled with mockery.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang said indifferently. “He killed my subordinate. Fine. Your subordinate doesn’t deserve to live either.”</p><p>Zhu Yike was stunned. Before he could react, he felt the world spin.</p><p>He was plucked up into the air by Dao Qiongcang. If he exerted only a little strength, his neck would probably be broken.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s eyes bulged in fear.</p><p>Why was the finger suddenly pointing at me?</p><p>I’ve been slapped with a weapon prohibition order!</p><p>I can’t die. I still have a lot of value. I can also be tortured into confession, even if it’s just a fake confession…</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Jin Ren hurriedly shouted.</p><p>Why did Dao Qiongcang suddenly become such a different person?</p><p>However, before he started to speak, he could either tempt him with benefits or appeal to his emotions…</p><p>Dao Qiongcang released Zhu Yike and said calmly.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll grant you Lord Shou this favor today and let this Southern Region evil cultivator live for the time being.”</p><p>Jin Ren was speechless.</p><p>“However, even if the death penalty can be avoided, the punishment for the crime cannot be bypassed… Xi!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang flicked his fingers, and the Qingyuan Mountain great array moved slightly and formed an illuminated gate.</p><p>Xi stepped out from the inside.</p><p>“Take him to the Dead Sea at the Saint Mountain and keep him apart from the Sleeveless Saint Servant. Don’t let them have any contact with each other. We’ll interrogate him again in the future.”</p><p>“Yes, sir!”</p><p>Zhu Yike felt very confused. He felt himself being flown up again and then he dropped into the hands of a young man.</p><p>He was shocked.</p><p>Was this the way to grant favors? This Elder Dao the Flamboyant…</p><p>However, this method seemed ridiculous. In that instant just now, if Lord Shou had not spoken up…</p><p>Zhu Yike didn’t dare to think any further. He turned and looked at the guy who carried him and started to struggle violently.</p><p>“I’m a higher void! Do I still have any face left if you carry me in this manner?”</p><p>“Behave yourself!”</p><p>Xi exerted force and dealt him a hard blow on his back.</p><p>This weak chicken that had been slapped with a weapon prohibition order immediately cried out and stopped all resistance.</p><p>Zhu Yike hid the strand of thread he had ripped off from Xi into his sleeve and said with a flattering expression.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I didn’t recognize you just now. It turns out that you’re the Chief of the Transformation Division. I heard that you previously served as the deputy head of two divisions out of the six divisions of the Saint Mountain. You have a high position and power. Now that I’ve seen you today, you’re indeed handsome and extraordinary. You actually have some of the dignity of the Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace…”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>“Oh, okay, Chief of the Transformation Division.”</p><p>Zhu Yike hurriedly piped down and looked at the remains of the Divine Puppet.</p><p>His lips suddenly trembled and his small eyes narrowed. His tears flowed copiously and were like peanuts poured into a pot of salt and stir-fried over a fire.</p><p>“Ah! Lord Shou…”</p><p>This cry was extremely mournful and earth-shattering.</p><p>Jin Ren looked at Zhu Yike silently and his heart was filled with complicated emotions.</p><p>“Lord Shou, Old Zhu will take his leave…”</p><p>Zhu Yike wiped away his tears and his trembling voice choked with emotion.</p><p>“Old Zhu’s captivity might last for a lifetime. When I think about how we will never see each other again in the future… Oh! Old Zhu is so sad!”</p><p>“When I think back about Sky City last year… Uh, it seemed like it was only a month ago? In short, Old Zhu will never forget the kindness he received from Lord Shou!”</p><p>“In this life, this favor is destined to be unrepaid. In the next life, even if Old Zhu turned into a cow or horse, he will be yours to ride for the rest of his life!”</p><p>In the Ran Ming ruins, Jin Ren’s lips twitched and he almost burst out in laughter. He opened his mouth…</p><p>Perhaps it was because the energy supply of the Divine Puppet’s remains had run out, but he was unable to say anything in the end.</p><p>In the darkness, the smile on Jin Ren’s face disappeared.</p><p>Xi, who carried Zhu Yike, took a deep breath and closed his eyes.</p><p>He then thought about how the Saint Servant and Yama had joined forces to kill the group of white-clothed people in the spatial fragment. The sympathy in his heart disappeared instantly.</p><p>Out of humanitarian grounds, Xi finally shouted coldly. “Any more last words?”</p><p>“Yes! Yes!”</p><p>Zhu Yike was not done yet. He put his palms together and bowed to the merciful Xi. Then, he looked at Lord Shou as tears streamed down his face.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
