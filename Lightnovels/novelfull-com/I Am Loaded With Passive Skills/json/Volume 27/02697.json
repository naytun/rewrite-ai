Dust filled the sky and buildings had collapsed…</p><p>It was truly a bleak scene!</p><p>The ghost beast Greedy the Cat Spirit struggled hard under the chains.</p><p>Demi-saint Ye Xiaotian spat and spewed forth a string of curses that hurt the ears.</p><p>Senior Fang Wenxin from the red-clothed people glared at Dao Xuanji with a murderous look.</p><p>Grandpa Yu and Zhong Yuanzi sighed and looked at each other helplessly.</p><p>“Xuanji great array…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen had followed the ghostly spirit all the way from Qingyuan Mountain, so she didn’t miss the last scene.</p><p>She stood there and watched the second half of the match. She watched as Hallmaster Xuanji saved the world at the critical moment.</p><p>She saw how the people of Jade Capital City cheered after they were rescued and even heard how the high-ranking people cursed the Supreme Master.</p><p>She had also seen the look of disgust that Cao Erzhu directed at her after he was taken away by Master Siren.</p><p>His expression seemed to imply…</p><p>There was indeed nothing good about a Divine Sorceress.</p><p>“You’re here!”</p><p>The ghostly spirit appeared, and Xi suddenly materialized. He was the one who summoned Yu Zhiwen, and the mission was issued by Hallmaster Xuanji.</p><p>As soon as he appeared, Xi saw the stunned face of the woman in front of him. There was a hint of dull gray in her incomparably beautiful starry eyes that were not there before.</p><p>Behind her, the snow and osmanthus lost their colors and what was left was only a gray and bleak landscape.</p><p>“It’s not what you think!”</p><p>Xi was extremely unwilling to speak up for Hallmaster Xuanji.</p><p>However, he couldn’t bear to see Yu Zhiwen being disappointed in her Supreme Master due to a misunderstanding. He immediately explained.</p><p>“There’s no one left in the Path Division. Hallmaster Dao has defected to the Holy Palace!”</p><p>“There were many loopholes in the Divine Secrets Array, and Hallmaster Xuanji needed to repair the Sacred Mountain great array before she repaired the Divine Secrets Array…”</p><p>“She came just in time.” Yu Zhiwen looked dazedly at the revelry in the city and her voice resembled the high pitched whine of a mosquito.</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>Xi immediately choked.</p><p>He knew what Yu Zhiwen referred to.</p><p>Hallmaster Xuanji had indeed arrived at the perfect time!</p><p>If she came a little earlier, not a single person in the city would have died or a single building would be destroyed. The ghost beast Greedy the Cat Spirit, would have been captured.</p><p>If she had been a little slower, she would not have been able to become the savior. She could only offer flowers and mourn for the tens of millions of people in Jade Capital City.</p><p>“Perhaps, it was just a coincidence…” He muttered something that he would never believe in his entire life.</p><p>However, as an internal member, he knew that after Hallmaster Dao left, the entire Path Division had also died a sudden death.</p><p>This might be related to the late arrival of Hallmaster Xuanji.</p><p>He couldn’t just kill all the possibilities with one strike, right?</p><p>“You should not be aware of this. After Hallmaster Dao left, everyone in the Path Division…” Xi still wanted to explain, but he didn’t know if he should say it out loud. After all, the impact on the person in front of him should be huge.</p><p>“But you should be aware!” Yu Zhiwen tilted her head and looked over. The snow on her shoulder scattered in the wind past her star pupils and passed by Xi’s ear.</p><p>“Even if Hallmaster Dao left, he would not cause any problems in the Divine Secrets Array.”</p><p>“He’s not that kind of person.”</p><p>Xi’s pupils suddenly trembled.</p><p>At this moment, all the thoughts in his mind seemed to have disappeared in the wind and snow.</p><p>“Absolutely not!”</p><p>It snowed heavily, and Xi heard Yu Zhiwen’s firm and resolute statement.</p><p>That’s right, was Hallmaster Dao that kind of person? Even if he defected to the Holy Palace, he had protected Jade Capital City for decades.</p><p>Did he have the heart to send the people in the city as fodder for the ghost beast Greedy the Cat Spirit?</p><p>Impossible!</p><p>Thus, he might move the Sacred Mountain’s great array and the capital’s great array.</p><p>But at most, he would use his identity as an elder brother and play some tricks to fool his sister.</p><p>He wouldn’t make such a big joke as a matter of principle!</p><p>After all, there had been a slight possibility that Jade Capital City could have been reduced to ashes.</p><p>Although he hadn’t followed Hallmaster Dao for a long time, Xi also knew that in the eyes of that person, there was no room for ‘a slight possibility’.</p><p>“To repair the great array… No, to mobilize the power of the great array required time and the assistance of a Divine Sorceress. Moreover, Hallmaster Xuanji can’t find one for the time being…” Xi thought of such a possibility.</p><p>If an array was activated by ten thousand people, it could be activated in an instant.</p><p>However, if it was done by one person, the difficulty would be multiplied. Perhaps Hallmaster Xuanji was delayed because of this?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen glanced at him but didn’t say anything.</p><p>“Swish, swish, swish!”</p><p>The divine path patterns started to form behind her.</p><p>The snowy ground churned and it seemed that tens of thousands of snowmen stood up in an instant.</p><p>The snowmen were chubby and cute with extremely nimble fingers. They manipulated the spirit threads and evolved into layers of the Divine Secrets Array.</p><p>Xi fell silent again.</p><p>“A Divine Sorceress does not need an array eye or even an array flag. One person is enough, let alone one who had made advance preparations.” Yu Zhiwen said.</p><p>Xi found a flaw in these words and he hurriedly said.</p><p>“However, even Hallmaster Dao needed the help of the white-clothed people… When he captured Xiang Yaoyao, he used the bounded domain power of hundreds of the white-clothed people as the array eye!”</p><p>“That Hundred World spiritual array is already like this, let alone the capital’s great array and the Xuanji great array?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen burst into laughter.</p><p>She pursed her lips and stared at Xi for a long time and made the latter blush slightly. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>“Do you really not know, or are you just pretending?” Yu Zhiwen sneered.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao had already taken action personally. Why would he still need assistance? He just wanted everyone to feel a little involved.”</p><p>Thump.</p><p>Xi felt as if his head had been hit by a wooden club.</p><p>He instantly recalled countless scenes…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
