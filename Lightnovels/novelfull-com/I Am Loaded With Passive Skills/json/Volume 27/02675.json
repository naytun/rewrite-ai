This means that I don’t have the authority to unlock that part of the information.”</p><p>“Hallmaster Xuanji should know about this.”</p><p>Dao Xuanji naturally knew.</p><p>She had also signed the confidentiality order and promised that the Divine Secret would never be leaked.</p><p>After all, if they didn’t keep it a secret, the Southern Region wouldn’t be cultivating the evil techniques but would have been taught by a proper master.</p><p>Who knew what kind of disaster that would bring?</p><p>“Take my token and go to the Path Division to get the information. I want to review it,” Dao Xuanji flicked her sleeve and a token popped out from her fingertip.</p><p>Now that she was the master of the main hall of the Holy Divine Palace and had the highest authority, she had the right to access any level of confidential information.</p><p>“This…” Xi looked troubled.</p><p>“Why? Is my rank not high enough?” Dao Xuanji’s lips revealed a mocking expression.</p><p>When she became the third emperor, the next stage would be the Hallmaster. However, the procedure has not yet been completed.</p><p>Therefore, she basically had no real authority and could not access such information.</p><p>However, Dao Xuanji was too lazy to care. After all, Dao Qiongcang was still around at that time, and she felt annoyed simply by stepping into the Sacred Mountain. Her main focus was to prepare for what would happen next.</p><p>Now that she was the Hallmaster…</p><p>Wasn’t that tedious process something that could be skipped with just a sentence?</p><p>“Hallmaster Xuanji, this isn’t a matter of level. It’s a matter of higher-level information regarding the Divine Secret and the Divine Sect. Perhaps there’s only one place on the Sacred Mountain that can preserve it,” Xi said with difficulty.</p><p>“Where?” Jiang Nayi was curious.</p><p>“The Divine Oracle!”</p><p>The Divine Puppet in the Council of Ten…Jiang Nayi glanced at the silent Hallmaster Xuanji, who had a dark expression on her face. “Then call it over!” She said hurriedly.</p><p>Xi looked at Jiang Nayi as if he was looking at a fool. “Divine Oracle Number Two died in the battle at the Sky City.”</p><p>“Ah?” Jiang Nayi was stunned for a moment before she continued, “A Divine Puppet can die in the line of duty? Couldn’t that Hallmaster Dao you mentioned fix it at any time?”</p><p>Xi wanted to mock her, but he was suddenly stunned.</p><p>Jiang Nayi was a bit slow, but what she said…seemed correct?</p><p>Wasn’t it up to the Hallmaster Dao to repair the Divine Oracle?</p><p>After all, as long as the database was still there, he could simply find a carrier for the Divine Puppet and modify it with rare items.</p><p>Senior Number Two could be resurrected!</p><p>However, more than a month had passed since the battle on Abyss Island, and the position of the Divine Oracle had remained empty. Even during the last Sacred Mountain Conference, he had not been seen.</p><p>At that time, Xi thought that even if Hallmaster Dao wanted to resurrect the Divine Oracle Number Two, it would take a lot of time and effort.</p><p>Now it seemed like…</p><p>Xi looked up.</p><p>On the golden dragon throne, Hallmaster Xuanji’s face seemed to be shrouded in dark clouds. Her thin lips and eyebrows looked even more sinister and frightening.</p><p>“Divine Oracle Number Two… Hallmaster Dao had never thought of resurrecting it?”</p><p>“He brought the components in Number Two’s head, including the information about the Divine Sect and other important secrets on the Sacred Mountain. All the information that requires absolute martial protection…Has he betrayed the Sacred Mountain?”</p><p>At this thought, Xi lowered his head and stared at his toes, his eyes filled with horror.</p><p>What exactly is a Divine Sorcerer?</p><p>What exactly was that unpredictable Dao Qiongcang?</p><p>He was clearly not in the Saint Hall, not even on the Sacred Mountain…Xi felt like he had just experienced a Saint war!</p><p>The entire hall was filled with saber lights and sword shadows. They couldn’t be seen or touched, but they were everywhere!</p><p>“Is there a backup of Number Two’s brain on the Sacred Mountain?” Dao Xuanji asked with a calm tone.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>After Xi finished speaking, he was even more certain that his thoughts were correct!</p><p>Before Hallmaster Dao left, he had ruthlessly tricked Hallmaster Xuanji!</p><p>If Hallmaster Xuanji did not know all the confidential information, high-level information, and even the highest-level information…</p><p>Wouldn’t she be blindly holding onto the position?</p><p>Wouldn’t she be hindered in every way when she took over the Sacred Mountain?</p><p>“Crack.”</p><p>Jiang Nayi heard the sound and turned to look. She realized that the armrest of the Golden Dragon Throne had been indented by Hallmaster Xuanji’s delicate right hand.</p><p>What kind of force was that?</p><p>He kept his eyes down and did not dare to do anything else. He pretended not to know anything and did not see anything.</p><p>At this moment, even the dumbest person would know what Hallmaster Xuanji was angry about, let alone Jiang Nayi, who was extremely intelligent to the point of putting herself in danger.</p><p>“To the Path Division!” After taking a deep breath, Dao Xuanji stood up abruptly and flicked her horsetail whisk.”</p><p>“I don’t believe that after studying the Divine Secret for so many years, the Path Division didn’t leave a single trace behind!”</p><p>“Even if there really isn’t one, I will still be able to uncover it through divine backtrack!”</p><p>“Yes!” Jiang Nayi hurriedly agreed and helped Hallmaster Xuanji up. “Whatever has been done will surely leave a trace!”</p><p>The two of them stood up and were about to walk out of the Saint Hall.</p><p>Thinking of Hallmaster Xuanji’s reaction and combining it with the information in his mind…</p><p>At this moment, Xi felt numb.</p><p>But all he could do was take a step forward and bite the bullet. “Hallmaster Xuanji, I have a third thing to report.”</p><p>“I said, go to the Path Division!”</p><p>Dao Xuanji stood in front of the Golden Dragon Throne with Jiang Nayi’s hand in hers. There was a cold glint in her eyes. “Have you forgotten what I said?” She asked sternly. “Do you want me to repeat it a second time?”</p><p>“No…” Xi shook his head and said firmly, “Hallmaster Xuanji, please listen to my third report before you decide whether to take action.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
