Then due to these burdens and restrictions he had placed on himself, he was defeated by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man in the end?</p><p>As for Hallmaster Xuanji, she wasn’t delayed because of the obstacles left behind by Hallmaster Dao. She had the ability to resolve these problems quickly.</p><p>On the contrary, she had used these burdens and restrictions to achieve success in Jade Capital City. From now on, the name of Hallmaster Xuanji would resound throughout the five domains of the continent.</p><p>“Sizzle.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen stepped onto the snowy path and walked past Xi’s shoulder and blew out a breath of hot air into the cold winter air.</p><p>“You don’t have to speak up for her. It doesn’t matter if she asked you to or if you did it on your own accord.”</p><p>“She’s my Supreme Master, not yours. I know better than you what kind of person she is.”</p><p>Her Pearl Gem Star Eyes lit up at this moment.</p><p>This pair of eyes tried to pierce through the Great Path to find out who the person who hovered in the sky with such an elegant demeanor was.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen strode forward and ignored Xi and left behind a set of footprints in the snow.</p><p>At this moment, her mind buzzed with the question from the Five Decays of Heaven and Man on Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>“How did you get your Lei Family’s Eyes?”</p><p>“You’re a nobody from the Lei family!”</p><p>“Who told you these things?”</p><p>That’s right, the Three Loathsome Eyes of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. She did not know if he had forgotten to erase the memories or if he felt that it was unnecessary.</p><p>In short, Yu Zhiwen clearly remembered those questions, but she didn’t dare to show that she did at the time.</p><p>Of course, she remembered her answer, the answer that she had never questioned in her life.</p><p>“My… Supreme Master…”</p><p>I’m not a liar.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man said that I was a sinner and that I was a liar.</p><p>Then, who was the liar?</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Outside the Xuanji great array, Greedy the Cat Spirit struggled with all its might. Its nine tails swept about wildly, and the black chains on its body melted off, bit by bit.</p><p>It seemed to have adapted to the power of the restrictive spell as it tried to swallow and digest it, a little at a time.</p><p>But the progress was too slow!</p><p>Forget about Dao Xuanji’s great array.</p><p>Now that Greedy the Cat Spirit’s Spiritual Cultivation had been sealed, Fang Wenxin could knock the ghost beast into a daze with a single Blood Shadow copper coin. It would be difficult for it to escape through the space.</p><p>The ghost beast could only roar, but there was still someone who continued to attack crazily after being imprisoned.</p><p>“You crazy woman! You fool! You’re a sanctimonious person who treats human lives like grass!”</p><p>“If you have the guts, untie me and let’s have a one-on-one fight. Let’s see if your stupid great array or my Spatial Upanishad is stronger”</p><p>“D*mn it… I can’t accept this!”</p><p>“White Dragon! Where is Senior White Dragon? Quick, come and save me!”</p><p>There was no response from the White Dragon. Perhaps it knew that Ye Xiaotian would not die anytime soon, or perhaps it found him annoying.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian felt like his lungs were about to explode.</p><p>He only hated himself for being too civilized. He did not lower himself to learn from Xu Xiaoshou in the Spirit Palace, so it was difficult for him to spew forth more unbearable curses.</p><p>He could endure the pain of having his arm cut off by Bazhun’an and the shame of being beaten up by Huang Quan. However, he could not tolerate the humiliation of being ambushed and taken down from the inside.</p><p>What the hell was this!</p><p>I was trying to help and you directly attacked me from behind?</p><p>“Dao Xuanji! I think you can’t even be compared to a finger of your brother, Dao Qiongcang.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was in the midst of his curses when his entire body suddenly convulsed and he started to foam at the mouth. As if he had been electrocuted, his eyes rolled back and he nearly fainted.</p><p>Along the black chains, the Holy Power was like a knife that rose and slashed away at his spirit and soul and he was almost severely injured.</p><p>“Bah!”</p><p>“It’s like scratching an itch. It’s not enough!”</p><p>After he recovered, Ye Xiaotian spat out a mouthful of saliva. However, even though the white phlegm landed on the Xuanji great array, Dao Xuanji did not even spare him a glance.</p><p>“Fang Wenxin.”</p><p>High up in the sky, Dao Xuanji, who stood on the auspicious clouds and held a horsetail whisk, looked directly at the old member of the red-clothed people. He still tried to activate the Blood Shadow copper coin.</p><p>“Humph!”</p><p>Fang Wenxin snorted coldly and didn’t even turn his head. He didn’t want to talk to her.</p><p>“Any results on the mission I gave you?”</p><p>The array fell silent.</p><p>When he saw this, Elder Yu, who had already transformed back to his human form, hurriedly patted Zhong Yuanzi’s back and told him to stop playing. Otherwise, if Dao Xuanji should be blown up, everyone would be in trouble.</p><p>Then, he quickly flew to Brother Fang’s side and nudged him with his butt. He gave him a look and said.</p><p>“You’re still the Ruler of the red-clothed people, and she’s still the Hallmaster. We’re in public. Give her some face.”</p><p>Elder Yu suddenly felt sad.</p><p>No, is this why I have been so tired recently? I have to work hard and take care of the emotions of others.</p><p>My… Bah, my fishing lifestyle, who took it away from me?</p><p>“What mission?” Only then did Fang Wenxin turn around with a flinty look in his eyes.</p><p>“To investigate the source of the ghost beast Greedy the Cat Spirit’s strange mutation and who caused it.” Dao Xuanji said calmly.</p><p>Fang Wenxin was stunned and suddenly remembered Xu Xiaoshou’s answer.</p><p>It was Hallmaster Dao…</p><p>No, he should be joking and tried to discredit him.</p><p>“I only heard a lot of rubbish from the enemy’s mouth. There’s no actual evidence. I don’t have an answer.” Fang Wenxin turned around.</p><p>“Oh?” Dao Xuanji’s tone was calm. “So you didn’t manage to stop the ghost beast, Greedy the Cat Spirit and it almost caused the destruction of Jade Capital City. You didn’t complete the mission?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
