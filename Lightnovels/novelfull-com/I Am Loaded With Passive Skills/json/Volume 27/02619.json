She was more like a granddaughter. But she also addressed him as Old Master. She did not seem to be his granddaughter either…”</p><p>“I don’t know. I’m just her friend.” Cao Erzhu scratched his head.</p><p>Old Master and old Immortal, what kind of riddles are you guys talking about… “Master Siren, what are you guys talking about?”</p><p>Mei Siren lowered his head. “You Tu.”</p><p>Weng!</p><p>The Taicheng Sword buzzed.</p><p>The purplish-red sword body glowed slightly; this made it even more eye-catching.</p><p>Jin Ren’s spiritual senses moved back from the sword. He was shocked by this answer.</p><p>You Tu?</p><p>Elder You Tu?</p><p>Cao Erzhu had followed the Seven Sword Deity, You Tu. It was said that he was either dead or living in seclusion. In short, he was a mysterious and elusive fellow?</p><p>August was You Tu’s student?</p><p>Sister August… She was younger than Cao Erzhu?</p><p>These two simple words caused a huge uproar in Jin Ren’s mind.</p><p>In a flash, he recalled some of the ‘dissolute’ chats he had with Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>“Bazhun’an and Yue Gongnu have a child…”</p><p>“Why would Elder Dao the Flamboyant mention these things to me for no reason?”</p><p>“Did he notice something and wanted to get some information from me?”</p><p>“Bazhun’an, Yue Gongnu…”</p><p>“Ba, Yue…”</p><p>“August…?”</p><p>In the Ran Ming ruins, Jin Ren felt as if his head was about to explode. He felt extremely energetic and excited, and his eyes were ablaze.</p><p>“Master Siren?” He asked uncertainly.</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>Mei Siren knew how smart Xu Xiaoshou was. He understood everything in a flash, that was why he just stated the two words ‘You Tu’.</p><p>However, he really did not know what Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts were. He was even a little curious about what was on Xu Xiaoshou’s mind at the moment.</p><p>“This August you mentioned, what does she look like…”</p><p>Jin Ren asked, and then suddenly he sneered. “Pah, it’s not important. Erzhu, do you know Bazhun’an?”</p><p>The corners of Cao Erzhu’s lips twitched, and his eyes were misty. “Eighth Uncle, I know him. My father said that he even hugged me when I was young…”</p><p>What?</p><p>Why did he start to cry?</p><p>Bazhun’an’s name could reduce such a big child to tears?</p><p>Are you really Kui Leihan’s child? Why are you such a crybaby?</p><p>“So what if he hugged you? A real man should not shed tears. Why are you crying?” Jin Ren couldn’t accept this behavior from the burly sissy, and he felt nauseous.</p><p>Cao Erzhu wiped away his tears. He didn’t want to cry at all, but his tears just couldn’t stop flowing out. What could he do?</p><p>“Father, he, he…”</p><p>Cao Erzhu could not complete his sentence after the word ‘he’ for a long time.</p><p>“Kui Leihan was killed. When Er Zhu discovered him…” Mei Siren lowered his voice and hissed at the array wheel head. “His father’s head had been cut off and placed in a wine barrel.”</p><p>“That is impossible!” Jin Ren shouted after he heard this.</p><p>Kui Leihan was dead?</p><p>Even if the sky collapsed, it wouldn’t be as outrageous as this!</p><p>I just saw him. I’d personally experienced how abnormal that guy was!</p><p>Who in the world could cut off his head and soak it in wine?</p><p>Elder Dao the Flamboyant, Bazhun’an and The Divine, these three were powerful enough!</p><p>Even if the three of them were at their peak condition, they would not be able to accomplish this silently.</p><p>If Kui Leihan were to die, it would be an earth-shattering event. How could he die so quietly?</p><p>Assassination?</p><p>That was even more bullsh*t!</p><p>There wasn’t even a shadow of a killer among the Ten High Nobles. Who could have assassinated Kui Leihan?</p><p>Among the Ten High Nobles, only the Ninth High Noble could fight!</p><p>But no matter how much he could not believe it, when he saw Cao Erzhu’s sorrowful appearance, Jin Ren could only comfort him first.</p><p>“I’ve wronged you. A man doesn’t cry easily because he hasn’t reached the point of sadness. Life and death is indeed a big matter. I should be the one to cry and apologize. I’m sorry.”</p><p>“It’s alright.” Cao Erzhu’s emotions switched very quickly. He replied politely. “You speak so well and so nicely. I know now that I cried because I was sad. What you said made sense.”</p><p>Hiss! This fellow…</p><p>Jin Ren used his spiritual senses to carefully scan Cao Erzhu from head to toe.</p><p>He couldn’t associate the person in front of him with the guy who had blown Dao Qiongcang’s head off.</p><p>That shocking God Punishment Tribulation…</p><p>Only the heavens knew that Jin Ren’s original intention at that time was to test Cao Erzhu’s skills. He mainly wanted him to divert Dao Qiongcang’s attention.</p><p>This way, Master Siren would have more room to attack.</p><p>After that, they would secretly observe Kui Leihan’s son’s strength during the battle.</p><p>Who would have thought that Cao Erzhu’s outburst would cause Dao Qiongcang to explode as well?</p><p>This was too unexpected!</p><p>While Jin Ren was shocked, what was more shocking was Cao Erzhu’s talent.</p><p>His God Punishment Tribulation turned into a sea of lightning, filled the sky and had traces of Wei Feng’s God of Killing domain.</p><p>His Hand of God was clearly the version of the thunder attribute of Elder Sang’s Sleeveless Red Scorched Hand.</p><p>The purple lightning lines that pierced through Dao Qiongcang was comparable to the sword cognition!</p><p>Perhaps it should be the other way around. It wasn’t that the God Punishment Tribulation was similar to the Penetrating Divine Senses 2.0, but that all these second-generation things originated from the first generation.</p><p>The most amazing thing was that Cao Erzhu was able to control the God Punishment Tribulation. After the lightning lines paralyzed Dao Qioncang, he was able to pull it back to his body like an arm and completed the final blow…</p><p>This might seem simple, but it was actually harder than ascending to the heavens!</p><p>That was Dao Qiongcang, not a little chick!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s body was the incarnation of a demi-saint, and the strength of his sacred physique was not weak.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
