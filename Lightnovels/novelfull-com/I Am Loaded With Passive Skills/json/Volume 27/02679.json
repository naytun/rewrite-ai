I’m afraid that the Three Elders of Guizhe haven’t been to the battlefield for a long time and might be careless. This could cause some problems!”</p><p>At the entrance of the Saint Hall, Jiang Nayi was worried.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s name had long spread to the Northern Region.</p><p>There was a rumor that her brother demi-saint Jiang Buyi, had died because of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>The most terrifying thing was…</p><p>Despite the words spoken, Dao Qiongcang’s unpredictable nature, his profound strategic planning, and his exceptional abilities were acknowledged by all. Deep down, everyone truly recognized his capabilities.</p><p>However, from the Four Symbols Secret Realm to the Qingyuan Mountain, Xu Xiaoshou had disappeared and reappeared outside the Jade Capital City.</p><p>This dog was harder to catch than a gopher. They had to be careful!</p><p>“Why do you think there are ghost beasts outside the Jade Capital City?” Dao Xuanji looked at the sky and calculated the trajectory of the falling snow, but she could not see the wind and clouds.</p><p>“This…” Jiang Nayi was at a loss for words. She asked suspiciously, “It can’t be related to that Flamboyant Elder Dao too, right?”</p><p>“You think you have the right to call him that?” Dao Xuanji turned her head.</p><p>“Oh, I mean. The former Hallmaster, former Hallmaster. I have made a slip of the tongue. I deserve to be punished, I deserve to be punished…” Jiang Nayi was sweating profusely. After slapping herself hard, she asked, “Does he really dare to collude with the ghost beasts?”</p><p>“He even dared to kill the judges. He even dared to allow the entirety of Path Division and the important people on the Sacred Mountain to die suddenly. What else wouldn’t he dare to do?” Dao Xuanji sneered.</p><p>At the mention of this, Jiang Nayi’s legs went weak, but she still couldn’t figure it out. She asked in doubt,</p><p>“With his level, how could he be so inadequate?”</p><p>“If I were Hallmaster Dao and wanted to betray the Sacred Mountain, I would be even more ruthless!”</p><p>“I’ll keep these people. When something important happens on the Sacred Mountain, I’ll let them all die suddenly. This will attract an even greater…Uh.”</p><p>Noticing Hallmaster Xuanji’s indifferent gaze as if she were looking at an ant, Jiang Nayi transformed into a goose and slapped herself again. Indiscreet, hehe, discreet…I shouldn’t have talked about the previous Hallmaster…”</p><p>“This is why you can only be Jiang Nayi,” Dao Xuanji was too lazy to criticize her.</p><p>Who knew how many rumors would spread on the Sacred Mountain and how many Dao Qiongcang would come to guide the country!</p><p>All of them were at Jiang Nayi’s standard and could not give any good suggestions.</p><p>“Hallmaster Xuanji, please enlighten me!”</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Nayi realized that she might only be on the first level, or the second level, or at most the third level. Dao Qiongcang was unpredictable and might be half a level higher than her.</p><p>Dao Xuanji remained quiet for a long time. She just silently felt the empty osmanthus and snow on the large platform in front of the Saint Hall.</p><p>Just as Jiang Nayi was feeling disappointed, thinking that this b*tch actually did not know anything and was just deliberately mystifying things…</p><p>Dao Xuanji turned around. Her eyes seemed to be able to pierce through people’s hearts. The corners of her lips curled up. “Are you a Divine Puppet?”</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Jiang Nayi’s mind went blank.</p><p>Her eyes widened and the whites of her eyes increased.</p><p>In the end, her face was filled with fear as she knelt on the ground in a panic and shouted,</p><p>“Hallmaster Xuanji, please be wise. I’m really not a Divine Puppet, and I’m definitely not sent by Hallmaster Dao to test you.”</p><p>“I’m a living person. I have a past, I have experiences…These can all be investigated!”</p><p>“I, Jiang Nayi, am a human!”</p><p>Dao Xuanji looked into the distance. “The Path Division also has a history. The people of the Path Division have also lived in the mortal world…”</p><p>Bang bang bang!</p><p>Jiang Nayi hit the ground with her head, her face covered in blood. She was extremely terrified.</p><p>“I’m really human, I’m really human…”</p><p>You bitch!</p><p>I gave you a plan!</p><p>I helped you to ascend to the position of Hallmaster!</p><p>Now, in less than a day, you want to burn the bridge after crossing it and kill me with such a crime?</p><p>You’re not human!</p><p>“Get up.”</p><p>Dao Xuanji didn’t mean to scare ber.</p><p>She couldn’t even be bothered to kill an ant-like Jiang Nayi herself. After using her Holy Energy, she helped her up.</p><p>Jiang Nayi heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>As long as she was alive, there was still room for her to start over.</p><p>She wiped the blood off her face and looked up at Hallmaster Xuanji. She realized that the woman was staring at her.</p><p>Thud!</p><p>“Hallmaster Xuanji?” Jiang Nayi’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s expression was calm. There was no sadness or joy in her eyes. She asked in a tone devoid of human emotions, “There might be another possibility. The people of the Path Division thought that they were humans until they died…”</p><p>Pa!</p><p>This time, Jiang Nayi felt as if her bones had been pulled out from the top of her head. She fell to the ground like a pile of mud, and it was hard to explain.</p><p>“I’m not…No, I’m really human…”</p><p>“Then what do you think about me?” Dao Xuanji leaned over and smiled faintly, “Am I his Divine Puppet?”</p><p>Jiang Nayi was petrified on the spot and looked at Hallmaster Xuanji in disbelief.</p><p>The masseter muscles under her cheeks hardened, and her head shook at a high frequency. Then, her body began to spasm.</p><p>The horror was like a slowed-down mirror-splitting spider pattern. It crawled from her fingertips to her arm and into the trembling blood vessels of her eyeball.</p><p>Jiang Nayi suddenly understood…</p><p>Perhaps this was the great terror that everyone on Sacred Mountain Guizhe would experience in the future?</p><p>“Ugh!”</p><p>Jiang Nayi turned around and retched.</p><p>She then saw two green blades of grass beside the steps, bending in the wind and snow, forming a heart shape. Dao Qiongcang’s half-smiling face seemed to appear in the shape of a heart.</p><p>No! This face was his sister, this woman’s face!</p><p>“Ugh…”</p><p>Jiang Nayi covered her mouth and retched as she retreated.</p><p>When her butt touched the cold pillar, she cried out again and jumped up like a rabbit.</p><p>Home!</p><p>I want to go home!</p><p>Sacred Mountain Guizhe was not a place for humans!</p><p>These two siblings were not human. They were both disgusting!</p><p>“Tsk.”</p><p>Dao Xuanji laughed, and the snow melted instantly.</p><p>She stood up and turned around. Her two fingers began to move, and the divine path pattern appeared on them.</p><p>This was the beginning of the inspection and repair of the mountain’s great array, as well as the capital’s array. After all, a Saint War was not child’s play. She attached great importance to it.</p><p>However, to resist foreign aggression, one must first stabilize the country.</p><p>Dao Xuanji had never expected Dao Qiongcang to pull the rug out from under her before he left. However, the deeper she thought about it, the more terrified she became.</p><p>“I hope that the Divine Puppets that died on the Sacred Mountain are all…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
