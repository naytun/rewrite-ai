This proves that they have all been killed by Dao Qiongcang.”</p><p>“As for Dao Qiongcang himself, there’s no need to look for him. Since he dared to kill, it would mean that he had made up his mind, no one can change it.”</p><p>“Just issue an arrest warrant… Dao Qiongcang is on the run after he committed a crime and has betrayed the Holy Divine Palace!”</p><p>Dao Xuanji lightly flicked off the dust from her horsetail whisk. After she abolished the rules set by the previous Hallmaster, she made her decision based on what Xi had said.</p><p>This, was the end?</p><p>Xi was stunned. He didn’t know if the new Hallmaster Xuanji had really left a mark on the people from the Judicial Division.</p><p>Would she dare?</p><p>Or was she just taking advantage of the situation to eliminate the possibility of Hallmaster Dao’s return?</p><p>“Yes, Hallmaster Xuanji!” Xi nodded quickly.</p><p>No matter what, he could not resist.</p><p>It was still the same. Even though Hallmaster Dao had been very good to him, he could only be loyal to the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>“Continue.”</p><p>“Yes, sir!” Xi quickly said. “The second thing is that the Moonless Sword Deity is confirmed to be missing. The jade token he left behind indicated that he had left the boundaries of the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.”</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s eyes flickered when she heard this. She had been calm and collected till now.</p><p>She pondered for a while and didn’t bring up this matter. Instead, she asked, “Where’s Wei Feng? Summon him here.”</p><p>“The Third Emperor, the God of Killing Wei Feng… I haven’t seen Senior Wei Feng since the Heavenly Group’s operation.” Xi shook his head.</p><p>“What was his mission?”</p><p>“I don’t know either. Hallmaster Dao separated us and kept our tasks a secret because he was afraid that there might be a Saint Servant among the members of the Heavenly Group who might leak the information.”</p><p>What a good hidden chess piece the Saint Servant was!</p><p>What an unpredictable character!</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s gaze flickered briefly before her expression became calm again. Finally, she closed her eyes.</p><p>At that time, before the opening of the Four Symbols Secret Realm, he had already made plans to send people out in advance. He did not have the slightest intention to send them back?</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, Gou Wuyue, Wei Feng, defected from the Holy Palace. Place all of them on the wanted list!”</p><p>When her cold voice rang out in the Saint Hall, Jiang Nayi and Xi were both shocked.</p><p>Wasn’t this too arbitrary?</p><p>“Hallmaster Xuanji…”</p><p>Xi wanted to speak, but Dao Xuanji opened her eyes slowly and interrupted him coldly.</p><p>“When Dao Qiongcang was in power, didn’t he teach you not to question the orders of the Divine Sorceress, but to obey them?”</p><p>“I remember that he wasn’t very patient, and he didn’t like to repeat himself.”</p><p>“Do you think that I am a very patient person?”</p><p>Xi immediately felt a chill down his spine. This gaze, this tone…</p><p>As expected of siblings!</p><p>“Yes, sir!” He quickly replied.</p><p>Right or wrong was no longer important. Only time will tell.</p><p>At this moment, to agree was what mattered most.</p><p>If Hallmaster Xuanji’s orders were wrong, she would be the one to be slapped in the face. It had nothing to do with him, he was the one who merely carried out the orders.</p><p>Xi was about to say the third thing when Dao Xuanji reached out and stopped him.</p><p>There was a moment of silence in the Saint Hall. Everyone could tell that Hallmaster Xuanji was deep in thought, but no one knew what was on her mind.</p><p>“A Divine Secret sect has recently risen in the Southern Region and rapidly gained momentum?” Dao Xuanji suddenly spoke.</p><p>“Yes, it’s called the Divine Sect.”</p><p>Xi nodded, and his thoughts became active.</p><p>She brought up this topic after the second incident. Did Hallmaster Xuanji suspect that Hallmaster Dao had taken the Moonless Sword Deity and the God of Killing Wei Feng to the Southern Region after they defected from the Holy Palace?</p><p>How did I get such thoughts… Xi couldn’t understand how the brain circuits of a Divine Sorceress worked.</p><p>He couldn’t think of anything good about the Southern Region.</p><p>Compared to the Divine Sect on the Sacred Mountain, this Divine Secret was nothing.</p><p>Wait a minute…</p><p>Xi suddenly thought of something.</p><p>“Tell me more.” Dao Xuanji seemed to be very interested in the Divine Sect.</p><p>Xi quickly snapped back to attention and stopped being distracted. He collected all the relevant information in his mind and stated concisely,</p><p>“The earliest origins of the Divine Sect can be traced back thousands of years ago.”</p><p>“At that time, they were not known by that name yet. They practiced the Divine Secret of the various evil sects in the Southern Region and also practiced other evil techniques.”</p><p>“After Hallmaster Dao became famous, the path of the Divine Secret was verified. Countless people from the Southern Region began to secretly study this path.”</p><p>“Twenty-three years ago, the doctrine of the Divine Sect was officially set as ‘The Master of the Heavenly Secrets, the Master of the Universal Law.’ It also abolished all other forms of sorcery and only accepted the Divine Sorcerer.”</p><p>“About half a year ago, the Divine Sect added a new doctrine, ‘Absolution of sins, change of fate, and the divine secrets to be apotheosized.’ Since then, the sect had rapidly developed and hasn’t stopped yet.”</p><p>“That is all.”</p><p>When Dao Xuanji heard this, her face seemed to be stunned. “That’s all?”</p><p>This was information that everyone knew and could be gathered as long as one wanted to. Dao Xuanji did not want to hear this.</p><p>The Chief of the Transformation Division should know what information she was after. In short, it was definitely not this general answer.</p><p>“That is all. I only have these information.” Xi replied firmly.</p><p>“The Divine Sect is growing rapidly in the Southern Region, but there aren’t many who can join the core.”</p><p>“Therefore, the Transformation Division was unable to gather any more specific information. In addition, our Holy Divine Palace is in the Southern Region, so we are not able to do anything there…”</p><p>As the saying went, the speaker was inattentive, but the listener was attentive.</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s eyes suddenly lit up and widened. Xi stopped abruptly; he did not know what sensitive term he had mentioned.</p><p>“Continue.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
