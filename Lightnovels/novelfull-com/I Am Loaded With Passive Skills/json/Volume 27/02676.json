Couldn’t he say it on the way?</p><p>Xi took a deep breath and said solemnly, “The third matter is Hallmaster Dao…”</p><p>“There is no Hallmaster Dao!” Jiang Nayi interrupted him coldly and smiled obsequiously at Hallmaster Xuanji, who seemed to have calmed down. “Relax, calm down, hehe…”</p><p>Xi couldn’t be bothered with this person. Truly, once the scars have healed, one forgets the pain. If they were outside the Saint Hall, he would have sliced off Jiang Nayi’s head with his sword.</p><p>“The third matter is that not long after the previous Hallmaster was taken away by the people of the Judicial Division, there were many sudden deaths on the Sacred Mountain.”</p><p>Sudden death?</p><p>Jiang Nayi’s smile froze and she turned her head with difficulty.</p><p>Dao Xuanji was also moved. After her pupils constricted, she continued to listen without changing her expression.</p><p>“Six divisions, the red-clothed people, white-clothed people, Holy Divine Guards, Mountain Guardians…Even among the group of Divine Sorcerers who were maintaining the Sacred Mountain Guizhe’s protective array, some people died suddenly.”</p><p>“These people died in the same way. It’s as if their souls and minds were possessed. There were a total of 673 people.”</p><p>“Among them, the one with the most serious casualties…” Xi paused.</p><p>Jiang Nayi panicked, “Which division had the most casualties? Tell me!”</p><p>Facing Dao Xuanji’s equally grave gaze, Xi’s palms and feet began to sweat. He said in a low voice,</p><p>“The one with the most casualties was the Path Division.”</p><p>“How many people from the Path Division died?” Dao Xuanji asked.</p><p>“They’re all dead…”</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Jiang Nayi suddenly jumped up, her face was terrifyingly ferocious, and her pupils trembled and moved.</p><p>“The Path Division has the top ten on the Heaven Rankings, thirty-six heroes, Tai Yuanzi and Elder Zhou, as well as the two respected seniors, the Horned Dragon and the Green Luan…”</p><p>“A few generations, both internal and external, add up to a total of hundreds of people…There were more than a hundred of them, and each of them was carefully selected. They were the dragons and phoenixes among men!”</p><p>“If placed in the Holy Palace, they would be able to carry the banner of the Dharma Convergence lineage and even establish a new lineage!”</p><p>“Even if these people were tied together and let that flashy…Hallmaster…Even if the previous Hallmaster killed them, he wouldn’t be able to chop off hundreds of heads with one slash!”</p><p>Jiang Nayi almost went crazy.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was only a traitor to the Holy Palace, but he could take away so many lives in an instant.</p><p>If he knew that he was behind this, wouldn’t he be able to kill them without anyone knowing?</p><p>Xi ignored this clown.</p><p>He knew that Hallmaster Xuanji should know what he was really talking about.</p><p>“Their state of death?” Dao Xuanji’s voice was devoid of emotion. There was not even a hint of doubt in her tone, like a puppet without any emotions.</p><p>“Same state. No matter where they were at, they felt possessed. No spirit, no soul, no intelligence.”</p><p>“Appraisal results.”</p><p>“The result of the appraisal…” Xi hesitated again, and fear began to spread in his eyes.</p><p>“Say it!” Jiang Nayi couldn’t wait any longer. She looked at Xi’s slightly flustered expression and felt that she didn’t have much time left. “Tell me!”</p><p>“Shut up.” Dao Xuanji glared coldly.</p><p>“Oh.” Jiang Nayi shrunk back like a little chick.</p><p>“The results of the appraisal, the initial judgment was…” Xi looked up at the two.</p><p>“The dead are all Divine Puppets!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
