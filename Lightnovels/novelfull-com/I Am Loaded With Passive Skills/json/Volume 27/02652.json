He had realized it long ago, but he did not expect that he had such a terrifying history.</p><p>Perfect blood tree and perfect Blood World Pearl…</p><p>The sanctification of the Seven Trees Emperor and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man by the Blood World Pearl…</p><p>History seemed to be about to enter a cycle?</p><p>“It’s not important anymore!”</p><p>The second true body immediately discarded the discussion of what was right and wrong.</p><p>After all, without the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, he might still be under Dao Qiongcang’s control.</p><p>I’m confused…</p><p>As a bystander, he had seen the Five Decays of Heaven and Man cast a spell that almost caused a disaster.</p><p>He had seen Elder Dao the Flamboyant being cursed by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. This made him even more confused and he would not have a good death.</p><p>With all these chaos, it would depend on whose reaction was faster!</p><p>“Let’s go back.”</p><p>The second true body said.</p><p>“There’s a change in the plan. Since there’s a variable like the Blood World Pearl, it’s absolutely impossible for things to develop according to our expectations.”</p><p>“In any case, Greedy the Cat Spirit is in danger because it is still in the eye of the storm!”</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot did not say anything. It nodded lightly and anchored the position of the Apricot Realm before it prepared to leave.</p><p>At this moment…</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>Within the spacetime fragments, countless spatial nodes streaked across like meteors and converged in a certain direction.</p><p>What was this?</p><p>The second true body probed and found that the spatial coordinates were that of the location of Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>“Return to the main world first!”</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot did as it was told and brought them to Changde Town. They took root in the void and materialized.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>He didn’t even need to search as a bright light suddenly lit up at Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>In the sky, a dazzling, complicated, and beautiful Spatial Upanishad array diagram appeared.</p><p>The second true body was stunned.</p><p>Master Dean?</p><p>Four-Hill Mountain.</p><p>The white-haired demi-saint Lou Yu from the White Tower was furious.</p><p>“Ye Xiaotian, Lord White Dragon was injured because of you, and the Holy Emperor Rao clan has a grudge against the Holy Palace because of you. You still want to leave?!”</p><p>“Your wings have grown. This Holy Palace is too small to accommodate a great Buddha like you, someone who is an Upanishad demi-saint!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian, who was dressed as a white-haired Daoist child, hovered in the air and stood on the same level as Senior Lou Yu. He said calmly.</p><p>“That Rao Holy Emperor bullied the weak and stopped my sanctification. He erred first.”</p><p>“Now that I’ve returned to the Holy Palace, the Holy Palace will have a spot for sanctification. He won’t have an excuse to deal with me anymore.”</p><p>“I merely sparred with Senior White Dragon. It’s common for Holy Emperors to have a sparring match. They can handle themselves.”</p><p>“If I want to show my gratitude, I’ll personally go back to the Shengxuan Gate and tell Senior White Dragon about it later…” After a pause, Ye Xiaotian changed the topic and said.</p><p>“And now! I used to be a student of the Spirit Palace, but I can’t just show up?”</p><p>“If I’m afraid of everything, then what’s the use of the demi-saint Upanishad title? You want to confine me in a corner so I will be safe?”</p><p>Lou Yu was so angry that his hair and beard stood on end. Who are your veiled insinuations targeted at?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is a Saint Servant. Why are you going? You want to drag the entire Holy Palace down with you?”</p><p>“The Holy Palace will not be implicated, I will see to that.” Ye Xiaotian remained indifferent.</p><p>“Implicated? It’s not enough for you that you were implicated once. You want to be implicated again…”</p><p>“Stop! Elder Lou, there’s only Sang Qiye who was implicated in the Holy Palace. I was not the one last time. I was just out of training and happened to meet him… I’m back now, aren’t I, after my sanctification?” Ye Xiaotian chuckled.</p><p>“I think you’re trying to anger this old man to death!”</p><p>“No, no, no…” Ye Xiaotian waved his hands and said.</p><p>“Elder Lou, let’s put ourselves in his shoes. I didn’t save anyone today because I wanted to protect myself.”</p><p>“Then if I call you again in the future, will you remain indifferent?”</p><p>“If I’m in danger again, I’ll call for Lord White Dragon. Will Lord White Dragon also hide in the Shengxuan Gate and turn a blind eye?”</p><p>“You!” Lou Yu was furious when he heard this.</p><p>“Don’t worry, Elder Lou. Nothing will happen to me.” Ye Xiaotian turned around and consoled the old senior. As he stepped on the Power Upanishad Formation, he said.</p><p>“Look, I have the Spatial Upanishad now. How long did it take you to succeed?”</p><p>“That Holy Emperor chased me and I sent him running.”</p><p>“I can even escape from this. The world is so big. What else can’t I escape from?”</p><p>Lou Yu gave a deep sigh.</p><p>He knew that there was nothing he could do, so he could only wave his sleeves.</p><p>“Men, take this traitor away and hand him over to the law enforcement bureau. Let him quieten down!”</p><p>“Yes, sir!”</p><p>Two people came to the door. They looked curiously at this legendary senior who was one of the Four Disciples of the Holy Palace and had the Spatial Upanishad. He had just undergone sanctification and he had already provoked a Holy Emperor and was being hunted down. In the end, they respectfully asked him to leave.</p><p>However, in less than the time it took for an incense stick to burn, they hurried back from the Dharma Gathering.</p><p>“Something bad has happened, demi-saint Lou Yu!”</p><p>“We locked him up, and demi-saint Da Yao kept an eye on him. He didn’t even blink. Suddenly, suddenly…”</p><p>“That Ye Xiaotian went missing!”</p><p>Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man, Mei Siren and Cao Erzhu gathered around a girl. They watched as this person’s fingers moved and constantly changed the divine path pattern.</p><p>“I did it!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s forehead was covered in sweat as she raised her head. Her starry eyes shone brightly with unsuppressed joy.</p><p>She held a golden Dragon Apricot branch in her hand. This came from the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>Through the branch in his hand, the imprint of the divine secret that Hallmaster Dao had left in the astrolabe Guilan as well as the support of the Qingyuan Mountain great array…</p><p>Yu Zhiwen had successfully locked onto the space node of Xu Xiaoshou’s Yuan Mansion!</p><p>This was actually of no use.</p><p>Because the Yuan Mansion had evolved into the Apricot Realm, the coordinates had become random and chaotic; they constantly underwent a transformation like the wandering Abyss Island.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
