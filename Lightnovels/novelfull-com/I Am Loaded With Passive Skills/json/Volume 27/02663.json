His gaze was still fixed on Dao Xuanji’s back.</p><p>From the beginning to the end, Dao Xuanji did not look back at him.</p><p>Her shadow under the light was longer and deeper than the average person’s…</p><p>Dao Qiongcang laughed. He looked at the judge and said calmly, “I plead guilty.”</p><p>Amidst the sound of wind and snow, the audience, who had come back to their senses, only heard the judge’s indifferent voice before he left, “Dao Qiongcang will be stripped of his position as the Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace. Dao Xuanji, the third emperor, will temporarily take over. The Heavenly Group’s operations will continue under the proxy ruler…”</p><p>“Break one of his arms and exile him to the Dead Sea… He shall be imprisoned for ten years…”</p><p>Elder Yu watched as Dao Qiongcang was taken away by the judge. While he was still in a daze, Fang Wenxin grabbed his arm.</p><p>“Come with me.”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi had just taken a step when he was also grabbed.</p><p>“There’s no one else available. Come with me!”</p><p>Elder Yu was stunned for a moment and was almost pulled away mindlessly.</p><p>He hurriedly pulled her back, and the corners of his lips twitched as he looked at the cold and arrogant figure on the main seat.</p><p>Fang Wenxin closed his eyes and stopped. He cupped his fists and asked, “Excuse me, Hallmaster Dao…”</p><p>Everyone stopped in their tracks and turned around at the voice.</p><p>“You can just call me ‘Hallmaster Xuanji’. Do speak.”</p><p>In the past few decades, Fang Wenxin had never said “Hallmaster Dao” more than twice.</p><p>After all, after the essence of the red-clothed people changed and the position of ruler became a child’s play for the Holy Emperor aristocratic family, Fang Wenxin simply observed things from the side.</p><p>“The copper coins are moving. A great disaster is ensuing outside Jade Capital City.”</p><p>“As the new ruler of the red-clothed people, Yue Gongli, isn’t around, I will have to attend to it.”</p><p>“In case of emergency, I have to bring these two along. I seek your understanding.”</p><p>Dao Xuanji turned around and flicked her horsetail whisk. Her thin lips parted slightly as she said, “Go ahead. Investigate the reason for the strange movements of the ghost beast. Outside Jade Capital City, at the foot of the Sacred Mountain, it shouldn’t be like this. It’s probably an internal disaster. Find the person responsible for it.”</p><p>Fang Wenxin was about to leave, but he was stunned.</p><p>“Internal?”</p><p>Elder Yu and Zhong Yuanzi were also stunned.</p><p>They couldn’t think of anyone in the Sacred Mountain who had the guts to collude with the ghost beast.</p><p>The corners of Dao Xuanji’s lips lifted slightly as she stared at Fang Wenxin meaningfully.</p><p>In fact, she already knew about the strange movements of the ghost beast. She was also the one who summoned Fang Wenxin.</p><p>However, Fang Wenxin was not interested in the Sacred Mountain and was willing to live in seclusion.</p><p>Even when he came out of seclusion, he only focused on ghost beasts.</p><p>However, how could there be absolutes in the world?</p><p>In the current situation, Fang Wenxin had no choice. Even if he was unwilling, he had to come out.</p><p>Looking at the third Saint’s eyes, Dao Xuanji laughed softly. “If nothing major was happening on Sacred Mountain, why would the Judicial Division be alerted? All of you, go and investigate. You must find out the information about that person and hand it over to me personally. I will report it to the Judicial Division for handling.”</p><p>The spy had to be of high status for the matter to be directly handled by the Judicial Division again.</p><p>Fang Wenxin hesitated for a moment. He did not want to get involved in the mess, but it was related to the ghost beast…</p><p>“What’s wrong? Is there a problem?” Dao Xuanji tilted her head and looked over. “Please speak.”</p><p>“There’s no problem.” Elder Yu was the first to raise his hand.</p><p>“Yes, there’s no problem,” Zhong Yuanzi added.</p><p>“I…” Fang Wenxin hesitated for a moment and nodded. “Okay.”</p><p>Dao Xuanji did not let it go and sighed. “Show more enthusiasm. Since you’ve agreed, do your best to find the person. The ghost beast is not important. What is important is that if that person is not caught, there will still be chaos in the future. I’ll leave it to Old Master Fang to take the lead for this important task. Secondary credit will be given equally to the other two of you. I will simply support from the sidelines and claim no credit.”</p><p>Fang Wenxin didn’t want to know about the world, but he wasn’t really ignorant of its ways. “Hallmaster Xuanji, you should take the credit.”</p><p>“You deserve the credit.” Dao Xuanji’s heavy voice fell, and she waved her horsetail whisk. “That’s all. The three of you may leave.”</p><p>Fang Wenxin remained silent and left.</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi, with a fluffy afro on his head, looked around and left as well.</p><p>“What?” Elder Yu felt a headache coming. He only left after he was done with his etiquette. “We’ll be leaving first, then, Hallmaster Dao.”</p><p>“Not Hallmaster Dao.”</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>Elder Yu’s head felt numb.</p><p>“Yes, Dao…”</p><p>“Call me Hallmaster Xuanji.”</p><p>Elder Yu hurriedly left and regretted even trying to be polite. Dao Xuanji was really hard to please.</p><p>After the group left, the 20-odd spectators gathered together and walked forward. They were all smiling and proud of themselves.</p><p>Jiang Nayi was ahead of everyone. With a fawning expression, she bowed 90 degrees and cupped her fists in a sharp voice.</p><p>“Congratulations, Hall Master Xuanji.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
