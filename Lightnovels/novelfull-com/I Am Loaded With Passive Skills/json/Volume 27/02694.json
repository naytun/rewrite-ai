Space ripples lit up under its claws and it disappeared instantly.</p><p>Before anyone could react, a huge white nine-tailed beast with huge claws descended from the sky above Jade Capital City.</p><p>The great array, the illusory barrier of the capital that resembled waves immediately quivered.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The sound of the explosion came from the outside and resounded around the corners of the streets and alleys of this bustling city.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Countless doors and windows shattered, and the floor, bricks, and tiles flew in all directions.</p><p>Sand and stones scattered about on the streets. With the appearance of this nine- tailed beast, a great number of eardrums were shattered.</p><p>Some people even fainted instantly and collapsed on the street.</p><p>“What was that?!”</p><p>“Heavens! What kind of spiritual beast is this?”</p><p>“How can Jade Capital City suddenly be attacked? The capital’s great array can’t protect it? Hallmaster Dao, have you gone overboard?”</p><p>The city fell into a state of panic.</p><p>Just now, they vaguely heard some roars and wild sounds that came from outside. This was something that was impossible in the past.</p><p>After all, the soundproof array of the great array was said to be the second best in the world and no one had dared to claim to be the first.</p><p>Now…</p><p>It was not just the sounds that came in.</p><p>What kind of spiritual beast was this? It crouched high up in the sky and lowered its head to look at them.</p><p>Anyone could see its lust for blood and flesh that was displayed in its blazing and scarlet eyes… It was truly terrifying!</p><p>“It’s fine. We have the capital’s great array!”</p><p>“Don’t be afraid. We still have Dao Qiongcang. My friend said that Hallmaster Dao was snoring away on the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe and forgot to attack. This beast won’t be able to stay around for long!”</p><p>“Is your friend that powerful? Then I bet that in less than fifteen minutes, a demi-saint will come on a cloud and take it down and make soup out of it!”</p><p>“Oh my god, I have a hankering for meat now. Tsk!”</p><p>“Hehe, I only want to eat its claws. If I cut its nails and made it into a sword, I can become an ancient swordsman of the Eastern Region!”</p><p>“Wow, that fur coat…”</p><p>Soon, everyone in Jade Capital City, under the protection of the water membrane, turned their panic into ridicule.</p><p>This city had everything. There were too many people who had lived here their entire lives and had never even seen a spiritual beast before.</p><p>Now there was such a monster that hovered in the sky…</p><p>It was rare!</p><p>It was indeed a rare occurrence!</p><p>Some people even hung up canvasses and started to sketch and capture the horror of the emotions they felt just now on paper.</p><p>In the midst of the calm and indifferent atmosphere, only a few friends and family members rushed to help up the fallen victims who had no experience with Spiritual Cultivation. They were all stunned.</p><p>“They’re dead… all dead…”</p><p>This shout was like a stone that sank into the ocean without any ripples, amidst the crowd’s surprise and cheers.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The ferocious beast outside the water membrane seemed to have gone crazy. Its nine tails swept about wildly, and it attacked with its claws.</p><p>It seemed to want to tear open this water prison and release the ignorance and arrogance that had been tamed inside. It wanted to ease its hunger.</p><p>“Boom boom boom…”</p><p>The water membrane trembled, and a loud boom rang out.</p><p>Some people covered their ears, some retreated to seek refuge, and even more people cheered and clapped on the long street.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>“Continue! Continue!”</p><p>“Let’s see who is stronger, you or our Hallmaster Dao!”</p><p>“Before, we can’t hear anything…”</p><p>“Bullsh*t! In the past, were there any spiritual beasts that covered the sky? After all, the soundproof array is only a partition and not absolutely soundproof. Didn’t you see that almost all the damage was blocked by the great array?”</p><p>“That’s true.”</p><p>With a whoosh, a huge and heavy ancient copper coin flew over from afar. It struck the ghost beast Greedy the Cat Spirit directly as it wreaked havoc on the capital’s great array.</p><p>In just a moment, Greedy the Cat Spirit’s nine tails flipped around, and its body was blown to the side.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>This seemed only to add fuel to the fire.</p><p>After it tilted its head, infernal white flames emerged from Greedy the Cat Spirit’s nine tails and streaks of purple lightning surged out of its claws.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Then, it attacked again.</p><p>This attack caused the water membrane of the capital’s great array to emit a sound as if it could no longer bear the onslaught of the attack.</p><p>“Squeak!”</p><p>The cheers in the city died down and suddenly silence fell over the place.</p><p>But soon, even more enthusiastic and excited cheers erupted.</p><p>“He’s here!”</p><p>“Someone from the Sacred Mountain is here. Beat it up!”</p><p>Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, outside the Saint Hall.</p><p>“Hallmaster Xuanji, are you ready? How much control do you have over the capital’s great array? There’s a huge commotion down there!” Jiang Nayi was drenched in cold sweat. He had blocked too many urgent messages.</p><p>“Wait a moment.” Dao Xuanji ended her state of Enlightenment and lowered her hands. After she comprehended the Divine Secrets Array, she stopped her movements.</p><p>“What are you waiting for? The ghost beast is about to attack Jade Capital City!” Jiang Nayi panicked. The capital’s great array had not been activated and was in its passive defenses state. Was she waiting for it to be torn apart?</p><p>“Are you issuing an order to me?” Dao Xuanji swept her calm gaze over.</p><p>“I wouldn’t dare!” Jiang Nayi hurriedly retreated, but he could not help but say, “If that ghost beast enters the city, there will be a mountain of corpses and it would be like the Blood Sea. The entire city will be in a state of terror!”</p><p>Dao Xuanji was unmoved, her blank eyes seemed indifferent to the people below. There was not the slightest bit of human emotion in them.</p><p>After a long time, she repeated.</p><p>“I already said, wait for a while.”</p><p>“What was Hallmaster Xuanji doing?!”</p><p>Fang Wenxin’s scalp went numb at the Southern Zone city gate. His mood differed greatly from the carnival-like atmosphere in the city.</p><p>His Blood Shadow copper coin couldn’t contain Greedy the Cat Spirit anymore!</p><p>The body of this ghost beast suddenly increased by more than one level. It was like a void giant now.</p><p>And at this time, Hallmaster Xuanji should have attacked from afar and used the capital’s great array. He had also requested for assistance in advance.</p><p>There was no action whatsoever!</p><p>Xi glanced at the old man from the red-clothed people and retreated.</p><p>He held the communication bead outside the city gate and had sent numerous messages, one after another. He was as anxious as an ant on a hot pan.</p><p>There was no response!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
