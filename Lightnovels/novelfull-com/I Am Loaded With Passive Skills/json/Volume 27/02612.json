He immediately sealed his hearing and blocked off the woman’s voice.</p><p>He had never met anyone who spoke so much and without any restraint!</p><p>Xi had heard of similar stories from various rumors and in novels.</p><p>And now, when someone actually mentioned this in front of him, he did not dare to listen at all.</p><p>It was too terrifying!</p><p>What was this Aunt Xiang trying to do? Was she really not afraid of death?</p><p>He thought of Hallmaster Dao’s warning earlier-even self-harm and suicide were not allowed. Once she was injured, could she really summon that person?</p><p>How could she be so sure that her man could even block his Teacher’s sword?</p><p>Aunt Xiang glanced at the indifferent young man. She was still narrating the story, when suddenly, she wanted to blurt out the words, ‘The Divine’.</p><p>However, when what she really wanted to say was ‘The Divine’, the words that came out of her mouth turned into ‘Dao Qiongcang is really amazing.’</p><p>Aunt Xiang became silent.</p><p>She continued to tell the stories from the past, and in the middle, she added the words ‘Ran Ming’.</p><p>However, after she tried to blurt out the words ‘Ran Ming’, it came out as ‘Dao Qiongcang is really amazing’.</p><p>Aunt Xiang fell silent again.</p><p>She was unwilling to give up, and she tried the words ‘Bazhun’an’, ‘You Yuan’, ‘You Tu’ and so on.</p><p>The results were always the same : ‘Dao Qiongcang is really amazing’.</p><p>You’re really something else!</p><p>Aunt Xiang turned and glared at Elder Dao the Flamboyant. She was unhappy and stopped telling stories.</p><p>Clearly, Dao Qiongcang had already sealed off all the paths she could think of.</p><p>“Stop.”</p><p>Mei Siren waved his hand.</p><p>Cao Erzhu hurriedly put down the old immortal from his back.</p><p>As he looked up, under the shadow of a swaying tree, he saw a person who stood in front of him.</p><p>His temperament was out of this world. He was clearly the strange uncle who had left the handshake pattern on his hand earlier!</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s eyes turned red.</p><p>Mei Siren took a step forward and looked at the boy’s expression. He knew what the problem was.</p><p>He gently patted the boy’s arm and indicated that he should calm down.</p><p>Although he couldn’t hide himself, he still hid the person behind him and walked out of the bushes.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang glanced over. When he saw a figure, he sighed. “Master Siren, why do you want to suffer?”</p><p>“Where did the suffering come from?” Mei Siren held the boy in one hand and the paper fan in the other. As he stepped forward, his gaze fell upon the remains of the Divine Puppet.</p><p>There was no need to say anything, no need for any confirmation.</p><p>Just like how Cao Erzhu was certain that he was a good person, Mei Siren could also tell that this was his student.</p><p>How did Xu Xiaoshou end up like this?</p><p>He was beaten to the point where only a remnant thought was left attached to this artifact, and he was on his last breath.</p><p>Not only Cao Erzhu…</p><p>At this moment, Mei Siren’s eyes turned red too!</p><p>His heart was filled with anger, and his Sword Will turned fierce and murderous.</p><p>On Qingyuan Mountain, the snowy leaves in the surrounding forest danced and gathered into a low vortex, as if a storm was about to brew.</p><p>Cao Erzhu calmed down and looked at it. He felt that it was very similar to the Green River Sword Boardline that his father had demonstrated.</p><p>However, his father’s Green River Sword Boardline was formed from the waters of the waterfall, while the old immortal’s Green River Sword Boardline was formed from the countless mountains.</p><p>Each had their own merits!</p><p>They were all immortal methods!</p><p>Father, your soul in heaven can rest in peace…</p><p>Dao Qiongcang turned a blind eye to all the Transformation around him. He gently moved the divine Sinan and said slowly.</p><p>“The battle report that was received after Rao Yaoyao’s death stated that she visited you and asked you in Dongtianwang City that night… You had no intention to join the game!</p><p>“However, you left behind your legacy on Abyss Island. You are no longer neutral. You have long sided with the Saint Servant.”</p><p>“Therefore, I would like to ask…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s expression was cold and solemn as he questioned him loudly.</p><p>“In the current situation, you, the Way of the Sword teacher of the Holy Emperor aristocratic family, should be a friend of the Holy Divine Palace. How do you explain it?”</p><p>With a bang, the snowflakes and withered leaves formed by the Sword Will were instantly destroyed by this shout.</p><p>Cao Erzhu retreated.</p><p>He saw the strange uncle’s force rise to its peak and break through the old immortal’s influence on the environment of Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>However, Mei Siren was not forced to retreat by Dao Qiongcang’s words.</p><p>In his eyes, Dao Qiongcang was no different from Rao Yaoyao, who visited the First Pavilion in the Sky that night.</p><p>Mei Siren looked away from the remains of the Divine Puppet. His gaze turned cold, and his aura soared.</p><p>“Where the Dao is, the word ‘righteousness’ is at the top. Where the sword points, the teacher has the right to take action!”</p><p>“You little brat, if you dare to ask this old man for an explanation, this old man can give you one.”</p><p>“But this old man also wants to ask you…”</p><p>Mei Siren took a step forward as his hair, beard and long robe fluttered in the wind.</p><p>As the storm approached, snow covered the entire Qingyuan Mountain in an instant. It was as if it had turned into a world of wind and snow.</p><p>Every snowflake, every stone, and every leaf in this world was the embodiment of a sword, and they all exuded the sharpness of an unsheathed sword.</p><p>“Bang bang bang!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu was frightened by the aura that suddenly erupted from the old immortal.</p><p>What was even more terrifying was that he could no longer hold the sword case in his hand. The sword inside seemed to be vibrating crazily.</p><p>When Mei Siren stepped into the air and waved his sleeves…</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>Sword cries echoed from Qingyuan as the Taicheng sword soared into the sky.</p><p>The purplish-red sword in the sword case turned into a rainbow and broke through the snow.</p><p>Mei Siren stood high in the sky as he held the Taicheng Sword. Under the silver moon, the sword body tilted.</p><p>With a loud bang, the ferocious sword image slowly rose from behind him. It was dressed in gorgeous clothes, surrounded by the Nine Swords of the world of mortals. It stepped on the ten Yamas as the snow that flew above its head worshipped it. It took charge of the green peerless giant and looked like a ferocious big ape.</p><p>When the sword image completely expanded its majestic body, the blue sky covered it and the moonlight lost its splendor.</p><p>It let out a hoarse roar, and its two swords crossed in the air. A storm raged across the sky, as if it vented its endless depression and anger.</p><p>Mei Siren responded and his voice echoed in all directions.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, you injured my student, how do you explain that?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
