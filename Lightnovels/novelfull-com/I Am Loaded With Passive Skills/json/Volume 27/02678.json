Are you a goose?”</p><p>Xi jumped in fright and recalled that night.</p><p>Even though Hallmaster Dao also scolded people, at least he could let them learn something useful…</p><p>“The red-clothed people who had higher positions, have already ‘died suddenly’. Only those who did not have much experience are left on the Sacred Mountain,” Xi repeated tactfully.</p><p>“Then get them from somewhere else!”</p><p>Xi heard this and was about to speak.</p><p>Dao Xuanji had already fished out a command token and tossed it over. Her tone was much gentler, “This is a transfer order. Next time, speak directly.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Xi heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, she was not a brainless Hallmaster. “The activation of the capital’s great array requires Divine Sorcerers…”</p><p>With a smack, Dao Xuanji threw another command token over. “Then go to the Path Division to transfer…people…”</p><p>Xi did not accept the order.</p><p>His eyes were empty as if he was deaf and did not hear anything.</p><p>Dao Xuanji took a deep breath and pulled the token back with her Holy Power. She then threw out a jade talisman.</p><p>“I will activate the great array myself. When the time comes, you can use this jade talisman to help Elder Fang.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>“Wait.”</p><p>“Uh… Hmm?” Xi changed his tone at the last minute, turning the goose’s cry into a questioning tone. He held the jade talisman and asked in a strange tone, “Hallmaster Xuanji, what’s wrong?”</p><p>Dao Xuanji used her Holy Power to draw the jade talisman back and said indifferently,</p><p>“There’s no need to activate the capital’s great array. Elder Fang has Elder Zhong and Elder Yu’s help. Nothing will happen.”</p><p>So…</p><p>There was also a problem with the capital’s great array?</p><p>Xi was deep in thought, but he didn’t dare to agree to the order personally.</p><p>“There are also three Saints on the other side. Demi-saint Ye with Spatial Upanishad, Sword Saint Master Siren, and Yama’s Deva…”</p><p>“Oh right, there’s also Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>The first three weren’t important. Xu Xiaoshou was the most important.</p><p>At least after following Hallmaster Dao for a while, he knew how much Hallmaster Dao valued Xu Xiaoshou, even more than a Saint!</p><p>“When necessary, I will take action,” Dao Xuanji didn’t explain further.</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>“Is there anything else?”</p><p>“Uh, no, not for the time being…”</p><p>“Then you may leave.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>He walked out of the Saint Hall in a daze and looked at the sky. He was a little sluggish and felt extremely uncomfortable.</p><p>It was an uncomfortable feeling as if ants were crawling all over his body!</p><p>He tried hard to find the source of this strange and uncomfortable feeling for a long time before he found the answer.</p><p>Too passive!</p><p>All of this was done in a defensive manner.</p><p>If Hallmaster Dao was still here, he would definitely not have responded in such a way. He, Xi, would not have lived so easily after reporting the matter!</p><p>At the very least, when he finished speaking in Saint Hall, Hallmaster Dao would reveal his hateful smile, as if he was looking down on him for spouting meaningless nonsense.</p><p>However, after that, he would still methodically give a comprehensive response.</p><p>For example, he should have gone to the Holy Palace to cause trouble for them. After all, no matter what the process was, Ye Xiaotian was always the one who came out to solve the problem.</p><p>The people of the Holy Palace should be checked and balanced by the Holy Palace. In the future, no matter what happened, they would be able to ask for some benefits from the Holy Palace… “Ah, I’ve become cunning, damn that Hallmaster Dao!” Xi thought.</p><p>That’s right, Hallmaster Dao would even mention details that he hadn’t noticed. It was so detailed that it was as if he was there himself and had gotten the information faster than him.</p><p>For example, in the portrait that Elder Zhong had sent over, the big outsider looked very much like Cao Erzhu…</p><p>Cao Erzhu, who had mastered the God Punishment Tribulation, might attract Kui Leihan if they were not careful.</p><p>This was actually a small matter. After all, the probability of it happening was one in ten thousand.</p><p>However, if they were careless, it could also lead to a fatal disaster.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao would even consider such a possibility, but Hall Master Xuanji did not ask anything just now…</p><p>Sigh.</p><p>Actually, that was true.</p><p>She had just taken the office and was not on the battlefield. How could she know more than him?</p><p>If that was the case, what was the meaning of his existence as the Chief of the Transformation Division?</p><p>Her reaction was normal.</p><p>The abnormal and inhuman one was Hallmaster Dao!</p><p>“Sigh,”</p><p>He let out a long breath and walked down the stairs. He felt the wind and snow blowing, and a sense of melancholy settled in his heart.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao had just left Sacred Mountain for less than half a day, but Xi already missed the existence of the person who had turned the entire Sacred Mountain into trash and made everyone’s work meaningless.</p><p>So Hallmaster Dao was that strong…</p><p>“Da da da.”</p><p>After a few steps, Xi stopped and heard Hallmaster Xuanji’s voice.</p><p>She was giving an order!</p><p>One after another, Dao Xuanji’s orders were delivered like an emotionless Divine Puppet.</p><p>The Holy Palace, great array, red-clothed people, the Path Division, the God of Greed… Her commands were orderly and meticulous.</p><p>The tone of her voice was simply the female version of Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>The scope of the plan included the overall situation as well as all kinds of trivial things.</p><p>After recovering from his shock, a smile appeared on Xi’s face.</p><p>Although it was a little late, everything said was accurate. She was indeed worthy of the Hallmaster position.</p><p>In the Saint Hall, she was indeed frightened, but…A tiger brother has no dog as a sister!</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>After giving a heavy response to the place where no one was, Xi’s dissipated fighting spirit was once again high, and he rushed down the mountain with light steps.</p><p>He suddenly stopped.</p><p>He raised his hand and looked at his palm. He was slightly absent-minded, allowing the shadow of osmanthus to fall in front of him and the snow to pile up by his feet.</p><p>This time, the feeling was completely different. It came from himself.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
