They laid the most solid foundation for the stability of the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>“No thanks.” Fang Wenxin, the old man in red, didn’t even raise his eyebrows.</p><p>His eyes were still half-closed as he brushed past Dao Xuanji and stood in the last corner.</p><p>He didn’t give her any face at all.</p><p>Dao Xuanji was expressionless.</p><p>The Kun Peng God, Elder Yu, looked around and sighed. He put away the fishing rod that didn’t suit the location.</p><p>He stood there solemnly, knowing that things were going to get serious.</p><p>However, he had come in a hurry and hadn’t even changed into a new pair of shoes. At that moment, his restless toes were exposed, and it was quite awkward.</p><p>“Can we start now?”</p><p>The leader of the three judges, the one in the golden robe, tilted his head and asked.</p><p>“Wait a little longer.”</p><p>Dao Xuanji looked into the distance.</p><p>Not long after, a sword cry sounded in the distance, and it began to drizzle on Sacred Mountain.</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>A rainbow light pierced through the sky and turned into an old man holding a sword. He nodded at Dao Xuanji from afar and landed on the side.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>There was a commotion among the people below. Some found him familiar, while others were sure that there was no such person on Sacred Mountain.</p><p>Just then, a child’s voice sounded, “It’s the Seven Sword Deity, Gu Yu.”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a commotion started on Sacred Mountain.</p><p>“Elder Gu?”</p><p>“He’s the new Seven Sword Deity, Gu Yu?”</p><p>“I heard that Elder Gu and Mr. Siren are ancient swordsmen from the same era. They are nearing the semi-saint person stage…”</p><p>“No way! Elder Gu has also joined the Holy Divine Palace?”</p><p>“Elder Gu is considered half a teacher to me. I didn’t expect to see him at the Sacred Mountain Conference. That is great!”</p><p>“But who could invite him, an outsider, to the mountain?”</p><p>“He probably came to observe the change in the Council of Ten. The audience is pretty lacking though…”</p><p>Before the noisy discussion could stop, many rays of Holy Lights and spiritual lights descended from all directions. The voice of the child sounded from time to time.</p><p>“It’s Hong Quan from the Hong Clan.”</p><p>“It’s Min Ti from the Min Clan.”</p><p>“It’s Jiang Nayi from the Jiang Clan.”</p><p>More than ten figures descended the mountain to watch the conference.</p><p>Everyone present could sense that a storm was about to brew.</p><p>That was because all of the spectators, without exception, greeted Dao Xuanji when they landed.</p><p>They were clearly the people Dao Xuanji had found to support her.</p><p>Dao Xuanji and the three people from the Judicial Division behind her looked extremely solemn.</p><p>“That’s impossible, right?”</p><p>“She’s his sister!”</p><p>Everyone was shocked and their thoughts were like a tide.</p><p>When the audience from the Higher Void and the Demi-Saint families arrived, everyone saw Dao Xuanji turn around and nod at the three golden-robed men behind her.</p><p>The golden-robed man holding the edict immediately stepped forward and circulated his spiritual source. His voice resounded in all directions as he said solemnly, “I summon the criminal, Dao Qiongcang!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The void was destroyed, and the giant beast engaged.</p><p>When the terrifying white-haired monster suddenly appeared in the sky above Qingyuan Mountain, Ye Xiaotian’s reaction was extremely swift.</p><p>“Space blockade!”</p><p>He turned around, and light and shadow overlapped. Layers of space interweaved, wanting to seal the ghost beast inside.</p><p>The spatial crack was so big that it looked like the sky had shattered. It could be said that all the Saints present were well-prepared.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before the space was sealed, the giant beast opened its mouth and inhaled…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Qingyuan Mountain’s spiritual source suddenly disappeared.</p><p>The complex space blockage was destroyed and devoured by the giant beast.</p><p>“Impossible!” Ye Xiaotian had his pupils tremble in shock as he dodged the attack.</p><p>At the critical moment, he barely managed to pull his body out of the giant beast’s mouth.</p><p>However, as he moved away, his eyes met the crimson eyes of the white-furred nine-tailed ghost beast…</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>His mind went blank.</p><p>All the colors in his vision disappeared.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>No one had expected the ghost beasts to appear so abruptly on Qingyuan Mountain without any warning.</p><p>What was even more surprising was…</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was so frightened that he lost his mind after just one exchange of blows.</p><p>By the time Yu Zhiwen cried out in alarm, it was already too late.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s body, which was under control, was held still in mid-air for a moment.</p><p>In the eyes of the ghost beast, the dazzling Power Upanishad Formation under his feet was like the best tonic in the world.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>The white-haired monster rushed over.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was able to come back to his senses not because he had broken free from the control, but because the control was no longer aimed at him.</p><p>According to the saint’s will, the ghost beast had given up on controlling him, not because it had changed its target, but because it was now charging at him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
