With just one attack, the Berserk Giant was forced back.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit didn’t get the upper hand either. He was blown thousands of meters away by the recoil.</p><p>However, as it glided, its nine tails suddenly glowed red and stabbed into the void.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit stopped.</p><p>As the distance between the two widened, Dao Qiongcang, who was standing on the head of the Greedy the Cat Spirit and feeding the cat with a piece of meat in his hand, slowly said, “Xu Xiaoshou, I’ve lost. I didn’t expect that I would have missed a layer of the Blood World Pearl, allowing you to escape the Apricot Realm in time.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang continued, “Well, I can always chase after you again. I expect the first place you flee to will be Changde Town, or perhaps Kui Leihan? Ha, I do have a backup plan. Unfortunately, I don’t have time… A bunch of idiots!”</p><p>At this point, Dao Qiongcang laughed and shook his head. As he dropped the topic, his eyes turned a little sad. “I lost, but you didn’t win. Just because the Blood World Pearl affected me, you let down your guard?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang went on, “How could you leave such an important thing to me?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang pointed at the huge ghost beast beneath his feet and said in disbelief, “Number Two had to use all his skills upon encountering the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. Isn’t that a lesson learned? What are you thinking about leaving the Greedy the Cat Spirit in my hands?”</p><p>“I’ll make use of it, and end its life when it’s no longer of use.”</p><p>As soon as the word “kill” was uttered, Dao Qiongcang felt a gust of wind behind his head. The Berserk Giant in the distance had teleported behind him.</p><p>As if he had expected that, Dao Qiongcang slapped a piece of meat behind him.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Berserk Giant was forced back by sharp claws.</p><p>This time, Greedy the Cat Spirit’s white hair glowed with blood light, but the Berserk Giant only got pushed back a few thousand meters.</p><p>Compared to his huge body, that was only a short distance.</p><p>“Flesh and blood…”</p><p>Looking at the piece of meat in Dao Qiongcang’s hand, the second true body suddenly realized something.</p><p>He remembered that when the Greedy the Cat Spirit was handed to him, Caramel had specially warned him not to let it eat blood…</p><p>Even when Bei Huai had stepped into the Apricot Realm, the second true body saved Greedy the Cat Spirit.</p><p>Now, because of a single oversight, Dao Qiongcang was taking advantage of Greedy the Cat Spirit.</p><p>Did Dao Qiongcang say if he couldn’t benefit from Greedy the Cat Spirit, he would destroy it?</p><p>“You deserve to die!” The Berserk Giant bent its back, and its body began to climb up, its aura continuously increasing.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s pupils constricted at the super giant. Dao Qiongcang did not dare to delay any longer and threw a large pile of flesh and blood in the direction of the golden light.</p><p>“Greedy the Cat Spirit, kill him!”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The Ultimate Giant hadn’t even transformed yet.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the nine tails were already in front of him. The Greedy the Cat Spirit swallowed all the flesh and blood in front of him.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>It bared its teeth and roared at the golden light.</p><p>The second true body stopped.</p><p>He didn’t activate the Ultimate Giant. He even recalled the Berserk Giant and returned to his normal human form.</p><p>The small human and the ghost beat looked at each other with reddened eyes, and the aura around them surged wildly.</p><p>“Greedy the Cat Spirit, kill him.”</p><p>The second true body didn’t throw out any flesh. He only pointed at Dao Qiongcang who was atop Greedy the Cat Spirit’s head in a frenzy.</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang laughed out loud. “Xu Xiaoshou, are you out of your mind? This is the ghost beast’s first time swallowing flesh and blood. Do you think it will still remember you as its master…”</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>His voice stopped abruptly.</p><p>Before Dao Qiongcang could even react, he was flung into the air.</p><p>The white-haired monster swung its head horizontally, jumping upward. In the blink of an eye, the white-haired monster used its canine teeth to swallow the lower half of Dao Qiongcang’s body.</p><p>Before Dong Qiongcang could react, the bloody mouth that was suffused with a bunch of ghostly energy was already right before his eyes. Soon, Dong Qiongcan was engulfed in darkness.</p><p>“Gulp…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
