Have you ever wondered how your First Pavilion in the Sky was able to survive till now?”</p><p>As the sun shone on the green plains, the mocking laughter broke the silence and killed the beautiful atmosphere of mutual appreciation.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Cao Erzhu stood up unhappily and looked around. He couldn’t find anyone, so he said loudly. “I’m not brainless!”</p><p>The air suddenly froze.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang.” Jin Ren muttered.</p><p>“That Elder Dao the Flamboyant? Didn’t I kill him with one punch? Cao Erzhu exclaimed in surprise, but then he thought of his father’s teachings.</p><p>It was very difficult to kill a true master in the Spiritual Cultivation world.</p><p>He had overlooked too many details in his previous attack as he was focused on venting his anger.</p><p>He didn’t launch any attacks on his spirit or soul. Instead, he simply crushed the strange uncle’s head.</p><p>“You must have injured him. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have stayed silent for so long before he came out. However, Elder Dao the Flamboyant couldn’t have died so easily.” Jin Ren used his spiritual senses to scan the area but he also couldn’t see Dao Qiongcang’s demi-saint incarnation.</p><p>The Qingyuan Mountain great array rose at the same time as the sunlight and turned into an incomparably bright light. Dao Qiongcang’s solemn voice floated down from all directions.</p><p>“Cao Erzhu, I have a good relationship with your father. We even drank together before. You should know this.”</p><p>“Of course, he would tell you to be wary of me, because I really want you to learn everything you know so that you can make a difference in the Holy Divine Palace.”</p><p>“The Saint Palace has a mix of good and bad people. He was afraid that you will learn bad things, so of course, he wants you to be on guard against me. However, no matter how vigilant you are, he would not have wanted you to become enemies with the Holy Divine Palace or with me. This is the first reason.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang seemed to have eavesdropped on the conversation between Cao Erzhu and Xu Xiaoshou from the beginning. He was well aware of everything that had happened. He spoke in an orderly manner.</p><p>“As for killing your father, that’s even more nonsense!”</p><p>“Let’s not talk about my motives. What benefits would I get from killing your father? Even if I really wanted to, I don’t have the ability to kill him.”</p><p>“You should have seen it before. That day, when our chat went awry, your father sent me flying with a kick. That was the second reason.”</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s thoughts drifted away. He felt that the strange uncle’s words made sense, and that was the truth.</p><p>He had indeed been impulsive last night and had lost control of his emotions.</p><p>Although the handshake pattern was indeed from a Divine Sorcerer, this strange uncle didn’t give off the vibe of being the enemy who had killed his father. It just felt like he was the one.</p><p>Cao Erzhu felt apologetic when he recalled that he had blown up the other party’s head because he thought he was the one.</p><p>“Third reason!” Dao Qiongcang was not done speaking and continued solemnly.</p><p>“In terms of results, Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have good intentions when he tried to persuade you to join the white-clothed people. In the end, he still invited you to join the First Pavilion in the Sky.”</p><p>“He also said it in a vague sense that the First Pavilion in the Sky is a dark faction, but not all of them are bad…”</p><p>“Heh, that’s right. Who can be called ‘absolute’ in this world?”</p><p>After a pause, Dao Qiongcang’s words were filled with sharp mockery.</p><p>“Did you know that this Brother Shou that you spoke about, when he was an Innate Stage, managed to deceive the Night Guardian and slander others. He made use of the red-clothed people to wipe out the entire Zhang family in Tiansang City?”</p><p>“Did you know that this benevolent and righteous Xu Xiaoshou used the white and red-clothed people as hostages in Dongtianwang City to ensure the safety of the First Pavilion in the Sky?”</p><p>“Did you know that this Saint Servant Lord Shou was born in the Land of Sin in the Southern Region and is revered by countless evil cultivators. He has a myriad of techniques; he bullied and killed Rao and Yi, drove Jiang away and decapitated Teng. His eloquence can turn the world upside down and he can kill people without leaving a trace?”</p><p>“You don’t know anything and you still dare to join First Pavilion in the Sky? Do you believe the empty words of the Chief of a dark faction?”</p><p>Cao Erzhu was stunned when he heard this. He lowered his head in disbelief and looked at the lump of iron.</p><p>This was the past of the lump of iron in his hand?</p><p>Cao Erzhu didn’t know who Rao, Yi, Jiang and Teng were, nor did he know where Dongtianwang was located. What crime did the Zhang family commit?</p><p>However, he understood what Dao Qiongcang tried to say to him.</p><p>Brother Shou seemed to be a heinous person. He wasn’t as good as he thought?</p><p>Before Xu Xiaoshou could say anything, Mei Siren’s face turned red and he shouted angrily.</p><p>“What an out-of-context excuse!”</p><p>“You are a sneaky, sharp-tongued junior who chose to stay hidden. Step forward and face the sword in my hand if what you said is true!”</p><p>The killing intent from the Taicheng Sword erupted. Mei Siren flew into the air and glared at the surroundings.</p><p>However, Dao Qiongcang did not come out. The Qingyuan Mountain great array buzzed and trembled, and only a mocking voice drifted over.</p><p>“Ask him if he dares to refute what I just said.”</p><p>Mei Siren didn’t listen to him at all as he slashed his sword at the Qingyuan Mountain great array.</p><p>However, the great array underwent a Transformation and gathered the starlight to shift the sword light toward the sky. Qingyuan Mountain was not damaged at all.</p><p>If the demi-saint didn’t want to fight and avoided the battle, what could Mei Siren do?</p><p>“Brother Shou…”</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s eyes were filled with suspicion. He lowered his head and waited for Brother Shou’s response.</p><p>Soon, he heard a nonchalant chuckle from the head of the array wheel.</p><p>“Elder Dao the Flamboyant is right. I have done all of that.”</p><p>“If you want to join the First Pavilion in the Sky, you will also have to go through this trial of ‘questioning the conscience’.”</p><p>“My invitation is just an invitation… Er Zhu, you have the right to refuse!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu felt as if he had been struck by lightning. His mind went blank for a moment.</p><p>Of course, Jin Ren couldn’t just swallow his anger and accept everything that had been told. He retorted.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
