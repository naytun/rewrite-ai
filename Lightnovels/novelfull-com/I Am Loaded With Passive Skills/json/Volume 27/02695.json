It has the Body of Devour!”</p><p>These two thoughts arrived at the same time via telepathic communication.</p><p>The scarlet glow faded from Zhong Yuanzi’s eyes as he remembered something.</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>He lowered his hand in embarrassment.</p><p>With a shake, the terrifying trembling energy on his fingertips turned into ashes and was absorbed into his energy reserve.</p><p>He tried to make light of the situation.</p><p>“I said this before, you have to hold up the array!” Fang Wenxin shouted angrily, then looked at Yu Kunpeng and said.</p><p>“Elder Yu!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>In the sky above Jade Capital City, the Nine Death Thunder Calamity and the saint calamity formed at the same time.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit raised its sharp claws again and responded to the thunder calamity. It seemed it would use the three pronged attack at the same time.</p><p>“F*ck…”</p><p>Everyone’s eyes widened in fear.</p><p>Even if they knew that the capital’s great array would not explode, this was too shocking and the visual impact was at the maximum!</p><p>“Woo!”</p><p>At this moment, a melodious and ethereal voice came from afar.</p><p>This voice was sorrowful and lonely, as if it rose from the deep sea and echoed in the world and jolted people’s hearts.</p><p>“What was that sound…” The people in the city were stunned.</p><p>A monstrous water shadow rose up in the sky. An even larger dark blue beast swam out of thin air from the southern side of the water membrane barrier of the capital’s great array!</p><p>It was way too big.</p><p>It was so huge that it was difficult to see the whole image from below. One could only catch a glimpse of the belly of the white fish among the deep blue.</p><p>A small part of its fin could cover the entire Jade Capital City!</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>“Kun?!”</p><p>The whole of Jade Capital City was dumbfounded.</p><p>When the dark blue beast appeared, no one saw where its abyssal mouth opened.</p><p>In the sky, the Nine Death Thunder Calamity and the saint calamity disappeared at the same time.</p><p>“Did they get eaten up?!”</p><p>Everyone held their heads and screamed in terror.</p><p>They had enjoyed peace in Jade Capital City for hundreds of years. When had they ever seen such a magnificent scene?</p><p>However, the double calamity clouds were swallowed. Greedy the Cat Spirit didn’t care and continued to attack.</p><p>“Screech!”</p><p>At this moment, the sharp cry of a bird exploded in the minds of countless people.</p><p>This bird cry was completely different from the melodious cry of the Kun from before. It was filled with anger and battle emotions and aroused feelings of violence in the people.</p><p>With a loud bang, the vast sky shattered.</p><p>Everyone only saw the wings of the flowing cloud that hung down from the sky. The true body of the giant bird was still nowhere to be seen. Only the foot of a four-clawed golden roc was displayed.</p><p>Before Greedy the Cat Spirit attacked, it swiped out at the roc with its claws and was lifted it into the sky.</p><p>“Screech!”</p><p>When Greedy the Cat Spirit was speedily lifted up into the clouds, everyone finally saw a small part of the giant beast.</p><p>It was a golden roc, and the enormous Greedy the Cat Spirit was nothing in comparison under its feet.</p><p>“Caught!”</p><p>Elder Yu’s main body was released. He sent this telepathic communication. “I’ll grab it and bring it to the stormy sea. I’ll be there in an instant. Follow me and we’ll discuss how to deal with it then!”</p><p>Fang Wenxin suppressed the shock that he had not felt for a long time and nodded. It was difficult for human beings to reach the level of power of Kun Peng.</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi’s eyes flashed as if he hadn’t heard anything. He only reached out and grabbed the golden roc in the air. His five fingers suddenly spread out and he even made a sound. No one knew what he said.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>At this moment, something unexpected happened.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit who was under the giant roc, could even break through the Spatial Patterns and temporarily escape from its confinement!</p><p>Its nine tails stood upright, as if someone had spread their fingers.</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi looked from afar and felt that this scene was inexplicably familiar. Then, he saw a destructive power light up on each of the nine tails.</p><p>White flame, sword cognition, Holy Power, spatial fluctuations, God Punishment Tribulation, the fragrance of Elixirs, Saint tree energy and the Holy Emperor dragon blood!</p><p>Its nine tails closed.</p><p>The nine great energies were violently mixed together.</p><p>Saint Nine-tailed pattern seed technique!</p><p>“Oh no!”</p><p>By the time Elder Yu called out, it was already too late.</p><p>That violent energy was like a natural disaster that descended on the world. It bombarded Jade Capital City with a destructive force.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>“Crack! Crack!”</p><p>“Crack! Crack! Crack!”</p><p>The water membrane that covered Jade Capital City emitted a cracking sound and numerous spiderweb-like lines appeared on it.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>“That’s impossible, right?”</p><p>The earlier mocking expressions on the faces of the people in the city froze bit by bit, and then quickly turned into horrified looks and screams.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>“The capital’s great array is about to shatter!”</p><p>“Dao! Xuan! Ji!”</p><p>Fang Wenxin let out a heart-wrenching scream. His eyes widened in anger, and his murderous intent filled the sky.</p><p>He tapped the Blood Shadow copper coins tucked in his waist.</p><p>The nine copper coins came out in full force.</p><p>He formed the nine copper blood array in the sky and faced the Nine-tailed pattern seed technique with great difficulty when the great array shattered.</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>Fang Wenxin spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>This energy was too violent!</p><p>The Body of Devour had fused with the power of all the Saints and that included the blood of the Holy Emperor. It was purely for the sake of destruction, and there was no other reason for it.</p><p>He probably wouldn’t be able to withstand it alone.</p><p>“Watch me!”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi knew that he had to rely on himself at this critical moment.</p><p>The explosive source seeds that had disappeared from his fingertips jumped out again.</p><p>He jumped directly to the intersection point of the Blood Shadow copper coins and the energy impact. Fang Wenxin was surprised and speechless.</p><p>“Go, go, go!”</p><p>Streaks of elemental energy were thrown by Zhong Yuanzi in a mixed and violent manner and it hit the Nine-tailed pattern seed technique.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
