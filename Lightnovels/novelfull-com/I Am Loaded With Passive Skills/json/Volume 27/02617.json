Her eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>What had she seen?</p><p>Cao Erzhu had smashed Hallmaster Dao’s head with a single punch!</p><p>“Is this a dream…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen had already regained her senses when she was thrown into a waterfall deep in the mountains after she was taken away from the Qingyuan Mountain great array to reflect on her mistakes.</p><p>She could no longer participate in the battle, but she was not blind.</p><p>The white-clothed people, ghosts, curses… including the arrival of the old sword saint Mei Siren… Yu Zhiwen saw everything.</p><p>She had time to come up with a plan to break out of the situation, but she was still worried about the battle that night.</p><p>However, she never expected that the person who could break the situation would arrive early and there was no need for her to execute her plan at all.</p><p>It was Cao Erzhu, whom she had met once before!</p><p>“Was that really Cao Erzhu?”</p><p>The big guy who was in high spirits and stepped on the sea of lightning was indeed the same big idiot from before.</p><p>But…</p><p>“Are kings, princes, generals, and ministers born better than others?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen muttered this sentence. The more she thought about it, the more shocked she became. She couldn’t believe that Cao Erzhu could shout out these words.</p><p>If he had such an ambition, how could he hide his identity in a remote place like Qingyuan Mountain?</p><p>Of course, everyone had their own aspirations.</p><p>Perhaps what Cao Erzhu wanted was to amaze everyone with a single brilliant feat.</p><p>For this reason, he had laid low for more than twenty years and waited for this moment to erupt.</p><p>But…</p><p>If they hadn’t met before, it would have been fine.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen knew what kind of person Cao Erzhu was. That guy was very careful when he spoke to strangers, and was even quite awkward when he pretended to be a senior.</p><p>“Are kings, princes, generals, and ministers born better than others?”</p><p>“That’s mine. You can’t steal it…”</p><p>How could these two sentences come from the same person?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was even willing to believe that this Cao Erzhu was actually Xu Xiaoshou in disguise, after he used his Imitator to transform. She could not believe what her star gem pupils saw at this moment!</p><p>But perhaps…</p><p>It’s easy to get to know a person, but difficult to understand what was in his heart?</p><p>They had only met once. Who would have thought that this big guy, who was only in his twenties, would be able to blow up Hallmaster Dao’s head with one punch?</p><p>Perhaps, he had faked his previous cowardice?</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Regardless, Yu Zhiwen still jumped a little after she cheered aloud.</p><p>But soon, she quickly restrained all her minute actions and silently muttered. “I’ve sinned, I’ve sinned.” Then, she continued to reflect on her mistakes.</p><p>It was bad news indeed that Hallmaster Dao was beaten up by a young man.</p><p>It should be sad.</p><p>In the night sky.</p><p>Mei Siren, who carried the sword image on his back, was also shocked by the young man who was engulfed by the purple lightning.</p><p>“Are kings, princes, generals, and ministers born better than others?”</p><p>He glanced at Qiongcang’s headless corpse that had fallen to the ground, and then at the Qingyuan Mountain great array. Finally, he glanced back and saw the ferocious sword image behind him.</p><p>Mei Siren suddenly laughed.</p><p>He had fought for so long, but he could not break the defense of the Qingyuan Mountain great array.</p><p>Cao Erzhu had only emerged once, yet he had blown up Dao Qiongcang’s head. What kind of disparity was this?</p><p>Admittedly, there were still some elements of underestimation, carelessness, sneak attacks, and so on. However, regardless of the outcome, let’s talk about the process…</p><p>If it had been someone else, would Dao Qiongcang’s head have exploded if he had carried out that action?</p><p>He probably couldn’t even touch Elder Dao!</p><p>“It’s the era of the youth…”</p><p>Mei Siren shook his head and smiled bitterly.</p><p>After he underwent sanctification, he felt both helpless and proud.</p><p>Who would have thought that in just a short while, he would hear the Holy Emperor’s sword cries.</p><p>There was no need to think too much. In this world, the only person who could become a Holy Emperor with the Ancient Sword Technique was that student from the past.</p><p>Mei Siren had mixed feelings, but he was more confused.</p><p>All the students he had taught were now ahead of him.</p><p>He however, couldn’t see where he should go after he underwent sanctification.</p><p>Everything was just like his self-definition before he underwent sanctification. Becoming a demi-saint meant the end of Mei Siren!</p><p>He met Cao Erzhu at the foot of Qingyuan Mountain and was educated by the young man instead and became clear-headed.</p><p>He had originally thought that after he settled his own matters, he would seek revenge for the death of Cao Erzhu’s father.</p><p>He never thought that Cao Erzhu himself would stand out when he could not keep up his attacks after such a long period and send his opponent flying with a punch…</p><p>How old was Hua Changdeng?</p><p>How old was Cao Erzhu?</p><p>The student surpassed the master; nothing was better than this!</p><p>The only thing Mei Siren didn’t understand was how Cao Erzhu’s current arrogant behavior differed so greatly from the Erzhu he had chatted with when he had gone up the mountain.</p><p>In fact, the old sword saint could even vaguely see the shadow of his own student in this guy…</p><p>“Erzhu, who taught you these words?” Mei Siren asked seriously.</p><p>They had only had a short exchange on the mountain and Mei Siren knew that Cao Erzhu would not have such rebellious thoughts!</p><p>He might not even understand the meaning of these words at all. He might just feel that it was fun to parrot those words and shout them out.</p><p>However, sometimes, there were some things that could lead to serious consequences if one were to act in a rash manner.</p><p>Him!</p><p>Even his father, whose death was not confirmed, might stand against the Holy Divine Palace because of this sentence!</p><p>And all of these could not be explained with the phrase, ‘Children are insensible’.</p><p>Cao Erzhu did not look like a child anymore…</p><p>However, if it was a pure heart, Mei Siren was too afraid that he would be taken advantage of by someone with ulterior motives.</p><p>Therefore, he tried to trace back the source and nip the problem in the bud first!</p><p>Cao Erzhu stepped on the sea of lightning, and the purple lightning swirled around his body.</p><p>After his tiger-like eyes swept around, the ferocity in his eyes quickly turned into his usual foolish look when he saw the old immortal.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
