It was also what the Spirit of Dragon Apricot had said …</p><p>With much hesitation and confusion, it said one word at a time.</p><p>“Great God Descending Technique?”</p><p>A smile suddenly appeared on Dao Qiongcang’s face.</p><p>The corners of his lips turned up and the jowls of his cheeks were pushed up little by little. It was a little scary!</p><p>He did not speak.</p><p>He continued to wave his hand and summoned a picture.</p><p>Changde Town was in the background, and the vague view of the small town below showed that all was calm. There was a hole in the roof of the Cao’s Blacksmith Shop.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was in the picture; he extended his hand towards the void in front of him in a friendly manner.</p><p>“Xiao Qi…” It was still the same phrase. “Get ready, Great God Descending Technique.”</p><p>“Alright!” In the scene, Xiao Qi, who was still intact, spun and jumped. A simple divine pattern appeared on its stomach…</p><p>At this moment, right in front of him!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang extended his hand toward the void in front of him with a friendly expression.</p><p>As for the damaged Divine Elf that still emitted flashes of purple lightning, it turned around with difficulty and went around to Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>It also revealed what was on its belly!</p><p>There was also a simple divine pattern on its stomach.</p><p>At this moment, in the Ran Ming ruins, it felt as if something had exploded in Jin Ren’s mind.</p><p>That surging impact caused him to be momentarily dazed.</p><p>He had seen this pattern before!</p><p>“Handshake pattern!”</p><p>Jin Ren nearly split apart.</p><p>His thoughts flashed like lightning and thunder, and his heart was in a turmoil. After the shock, all the images related to this were strung together.</p><p>What he saw with his spiritual senses…</p><p>In the image that Dao Qiongcang summoned, he had already grasped the handshake pattern.</p><p>At this moment, Dao Qiongcang in the Chaotic Spiritual Sky had also grasped the handshake pattern on Xiao Qi’s belly, that still emitted flashes of purple lightning!</p><p>In his mind…</p><p>This handshake pattern was in a jade scroll called the Collection of Excuses. After the 333rd excuse, it was presented in an illusory way:</p><p>“Ran Ming ruins, Xu Xiaoshou encountered.”</p><p>Jin Ren felt as if he saw an illusion.</p><p>He actually heard Dao Qiongcang saying this.</p><p>When he regained his senses, he realized that it was not an illusion!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang truly seemed to have the Mind Reading Technique and greeted him with the same phrase that he had kept hidden for so long.</p><p>“Ran Ming ruins, Xu Xiaoshou encountered.”</p><p>This terror was ignited to the extreme in an instant!</p><p>Jin Ren was really frightened. Did Elder Dao the Flamboyant really know what was on his mind?</p><p>How was this still a human?</p><p>He was even more accurate than the Divine Puppet! He was even more terrifying than a monster!</p><p>It wasn’t over yet…</p><p>At this moment, Jin Ren knew what the so-called Great God Descending Technique was.</p><p>Because when every insignificant thing in the spiritual senses faded away, what was left was the scene that Dao Qiongcang summoned…</p><p>After he grabbed the handshake pattern on Xiao Qi’s belly, he disappeared!</p><p>The scene changed. Outside the ugly pig hide shop, Dongdong held a City Leaving Token and her body was rigid.</p><p>When the command token dropped, a handshake pattern that had never appeared before lit up in her palm.</p><p>The scene changed again. When the handshake pattern continued to flash in a corner that no one paid any attention to, Dao Qiongcang walked out of her body!</p><p>“Great God Descending Technique…”</p><p>“That was the Great God Descending Technique?!”</p><p>In the dark underground of the Ran Ming ruins.</p><p>After Jin Ren recovered from his shock, he hurriedly lowered his head and looked at his palms.</p><p>“Fortunately, there’s nothing…”</p><p>He heaved a sigh of relief. He was glad that he had resolved the problem so quickly when he had been caught up in the weirdness of the Collection of Excuses. He had been so ruthless that he had chopped off his entire arm.</p><p>After that, he searched his body, his mind and soul, but there was no Hidden Divine Secret.</p><p>Only then did he feel relieved.</p><p>Then, because Bei Huai’s ability could affect his main body, he needed Jin Ren to cry on his behalf, so he did not self-destruct in time…</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>Jin Ren’s pupils suddenly dilated.</p><p>Was this also part of his plan?</p><p>After that, he had lost consciousness, so he had no choice but to send a wisp of his spiritual senses to save Xiang Yaoyao. He could not self-destruct anymore…</p><p>Was this also part of the scheme?</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Jin Ren laughed at himself.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was unpredictable, but not to the extent of…</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>Jin Ren’s thoughts suddenly froze.</p><p>Because he suddenly saw a handshake pattern appear in his palm, right after Dao Qiongcang grabbed the pattern on Xiao Qi’s belly on Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>“F*ck!!!”</p><p>Jin Ren used his fingers as a sword to cut off his regenerated arm again, but it was useless.</p><p>There was also a handshake pattern on his left palm…</p><p>A handshake pattern also appeared on his chest…</p><p>His head, abdomen, thighs, back… They were densely packed, and all of them revealed the handshake pattern!</p><p>Under the Qingyuan Mountain that was in total chaos and had completely disintegrated into the shapes of countless monsters, Dao Qiongcang grinned and opened his mouth slowly in the sealed environment of the ancient, heavy bronze door.</p><p>He still said the same sentence in a calm and composed voice, but the order of the words was a little reversed.</p><p>“The Ran Ming ruins encountered, Xu Xiaoshou.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
