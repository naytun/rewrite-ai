He shrieked, “Guard, come over here!”</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>At the entrance of the great hall, a mass of ghostly energy morph forms condensed into the figure of a black-robed youth.</p><p>Jiang Nayi jumped in fright. This method was too strange!</p><p>He caught on very quickly. He was now the favorite of the new Hallmaster, so what was there to be afraid of?</p><p>“Who are you?” Jiang Nayi asked with a scoff.</p><p>“Chief Xi from the Transformation Division.”</p><p>“You are Xi?” Jiang Nayi restrained himself and did not dare to be too arrogant.</p><p>He came from a Demi-Saint family, so he knew a little about this person. “Weren’t you with Hallmaster Dao in a battle outside? Why are you here?”</p><p>Xi, who stood at the entrance of the Saint Hall, couldn’t help but look up at this eccentric fellow who spouted nonsense.</p><p>With just a glance, he could tell that he had never seen this person on the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe before.</p><p>But soon, a thought flashed through his mind and all the details of this guy were displayed in his mind.</p><p>Jiang Nayi, below average talent.</p><p>It was all thanks to his elder brother Jiang Buyi’s secret help that he was able to avoid any internal strife within the clan and survive outside.</p><p>His cultivation level was barely at the higher void level even with the help of spiritual herbs, and his combat strength was almost zero.</p><p>Back then, he had almost died under the Nine Death Thunder Calamity, and he had survived it all by chance. In fact, it was also Jiang Buyi who had acted in secret to help him.</p><p>There were only two commendable points about this person. He was eloquent and cunning.</p><p>But it was hard for him to do any great stuff.</p><p>Xi looked past this person and stared at the new Hallmaster on the main seat.</p><p>He came late, but his subordinates had already told him everything that had happened on the Sacred Mountain.</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao, I have something important to report…”</p><p>“Hmm?” Jiang Nayi’s nasal voice rose as he rudely interrupted. “What ‘Hallmaster Dao’? Now, you have to address her as Hallmaster Xuanji!”</p><p>Xi was startled. He shifted slightly and glanced at this arrogant fellow.</p><p>Jiang Nayi’s legs went limp and his body was soaked in sweat. He almost collapsed as he held onto the dragon throne. “Hallmaster Xuanji, he glared at me…”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>“Oh.” Jiang Nayi didn’t dare to do anything. He knew that Xi held a higher position in Xuanji Hallmaster’s heart than he did.</p><p>“Speak.”</p><p>“Yes, Hallmaster Xuanji!”</p><p>Xi was relieved. This was the first time he had seen someone who was such a deadbeat on the Sacred Mountain.</p><p>He didn’t even need to do anything himself. Perhaps tomorrow, this guy would die in an accident.</p><p>“Dao… The previous Hallmaster had already captured the Ten High Nobles Xiang Yaoyao and ordered me to bring her back to the Sacred Mountain.”</p><p>“Zhu Yike from the First Pavilion in the Sky was also brought back. His codename is the Red Flower Bandit. This person tried to escape midway and was… The previous Hallmaster saw through the trick and he was recaptured.”</p><p>“In addition, the previous Hallmaster’s widespread net had also captured Ghostface from the Ghost God Gang, Quan Sanqing from the Quan Gang, Ni Cai. There were also the remaining members of the Yougui Pavilion, as well as a group of assassins who were suspected to be higher voids from the Xiang family…”</p><p>“At this point, most of the spies that belonged to the Saint Servant in Jade Capital City have been removed.”</p><p>After a pause, Xi remembered something.</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao had also arranged for an investigation into the coachman who accidentally barged into the area while Xiang Yaoyao was being used as bait when they were at the gate of the Southern Zone.”</p><p>“Our initial suspicion was that there was indeed such a coachman organization. The leader is called Horse Face and is suspected to be… Ni Cai.”</p><p>“But I suspect that someone of a higher level is still lurking about in Jade Capital City. After all, he couldn’t even protect himself at that time and couldn’t send a message.”</p><p>“That’s all.”</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s eyes were blank and her face was devoid of any expression.</p><p>After Jiang Nayi heard this, he was slightly shocked. Using the Ten High Nobles as bait to lure so many people was quite impressive!</p><p>Fortunately, Xiang Yaoyao’s arrival was a little late. Otherwise, Dao Qiongcang’s crime would have been erased…</p><p>But on second thought.</p><p>Compared to the more than thirty charges, this was useless.</p><p>Moreover, they had only managed to capture the famous Xiang Yaoyao after such a huge commotion… Dao Qiongcang was nothing special!</p><p>“Have you interrogated these people?” Jiang Nayi glanced at Hallmaster Xuanji and spoke on her behalf.</p><p>Xi did not bother with him.</p><p>Dao Xuanji gave him a look that clearly indicated she had the same question.</p><p>These two people…</p><p>Xi was surprised.</p><p>It didn’t matter who the Hallmaster of the Sacred Mountain was.</p><p>In any case, their surnames were Dao and they were all very powerful. It was fine for them to do their own stuff. This way, it would not be easy for anything to happen.</p><p>However, it came as a surprise that Hallmaster Xuanji would put such a useless person in such an important position.</p><p>What was so special about this Jiang Nayi?</p><p>Their relationship did not seem to be normal?</p><p>Northern Region…</p><p>As he thought of the scattered faction over there, Xi fell into deep thought.</p><p>But even Hallmaster Dao didn’t touch the Northern Region. There must be a reason!</p><p>The moment Hallmaster Xuanji came into position, she wanted to reorganize the other side?</p><p>It couldn’t possibly be the credit that the older brother left for the younger sister, right?</p><p>Xi was shocked. He felt that this was too mysterious. After all, he knew that it was through backstabbing that Hallmaster Xuanji had gotten the position.</p><p>If he had been Hallmaster Dao, he wouldn’t even wait for a slap and would even send the Northern Region as a congratulatory gift?</p><p>Calm down, calm down…</p><p>Xi, ah, Xi, this is not something a small fry like you should think about. Whoever thinks about it will die!</p><p>“Except for Xiang Yaoyao, I’ve interrogated everyone, but none of them were willing to talk.” Xi quickly replied.</p><p>Jiang Nayi blurted out when he heard that. “Then it seems that your Transformation Division is not very good either…”</p><p>When he felt a chill run down his spine, Jiang Nayi quickly changed the topic. “This Ni Cai… haha… is a person?”</p><p>“Yes.” Xi nodded.</p><p>“Haha, so funny! Why did someone come up with such a funny code name? Haha, haha… Uh.”</p><p>Jiang Nayi laughed out loud, but when he saw that neither Xi or Hallmaster Xuanji laughed, he awkwardly wiped his mouth and kept quiet.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
