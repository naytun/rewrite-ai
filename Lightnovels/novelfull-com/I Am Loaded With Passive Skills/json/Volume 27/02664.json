After the snow of Sacred Mountain blew into the bamboo forest, it became a spring breeze.</p><p>With a rustling sound, the Divine Secrets Array collapsed layer by layer and disappeared at the center.</p><p>The center of the ground cracked open, and a flawless jade-white hand reached out.</p><p>Her slender fingers were like that of the most exquisite sculpture in the world. No blood vessels or pores could be seen, but secret runes flowed faintly inside, full of vitality.</p><p>The Dayan Grotto-Heaven transformed layer by layer and was quickly absorbed into the jade-like hand.</p><p>Soon, the hand moved again, pressing hard on the ground. Then emerged a the top half of a handsome man with excellent facial features and extraordinary looks.</p><p>His black hair was like a waterfall, flowing gently. The muscles on his neck, chest, and abdomen were extremely smooth, and his complexion was as shiny as jade.</p><p>Once he was out of the ground, the man seemed to be unable to stand the light. He turned his head to the side and narrowed his eyes for a while. Only then did he get used to it.</p><p>“Thirty years in the blink of an eye, one cycle in the mortal world…”</p><p>After a moment of absent-mindedness, the man completely pulled himself out of the soil. He was naked, and heaven and earth were his clothes.</p><p>When he took his first step, everything in the Dayan Grotto-Heaven died. All the spiritual energy gathered and formed a simple and thin white robe on his body.</p><p>When he took his second step, the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe’s protective great array did not move. Three beams of holy light flew over from the sky and returned to his body.</p><p>At the same time, Dao Qiongcang, who had been following the three golden-robed men from the Judicial Division to the Dead Sea to be punished, suddenly felt his legs go weak, and he went lifeless as if his soul had left his body.</p><p>The golden-robed man was stunned for a moment. The one holding the sword quickly shouted, “Men!”</p><p>There was no commotion behind them, nor was there any densely packed crowd. Only a white-clothed man walked over at a moderate speed.</p><p>The sword-wielding golden-robed man’s brows instantly knitted in anger.</p><p>“Hurry up and come over! Check on Dao Qiongcang. Is he faking his death?”</p><p>“Wait…” The golden-robed man frowned and looked at the white-robed man, feeling a little strange.</p><p>It was normal for white-clothed people to be on the Sacred Mountain.</p><p>What was unusual was that that person was walking too slowly, as if he had not heard the decree of the Judicial Division.</p><p>“Stop!” the gold-robed man immediately shouted.</p><p>He let out a sigh of relief when he saw the white-clothed figure stop in the distance.</p><p>In the next second, the white-clothed man appeared in front of the three of them in one step. His long black hair fluttered in the air.</p><p>At the same time, the blurry face solidified.</p><p>“You are… Dao Qiongcang?”</p><p>The sword-wielding golden-robed man was shocked.</p><p>That fair and clean face was clearly Dao Qiongcang’s face.</p><p>However, all the precious jade and gold pearls on his body were missing. Other than the white unlined garment that barely covered his body, there was nothing else, not even a belt. Dao Qiongcang’s lookalike was too simply dressed, so the man almost couldn’t recognize him!</p><p>The golden-robed man holding the imperial edict pulled the two people beside him and stepped back in panic. He appeared fierce but was cowardly inside and shouted, “Dao Qiongcang, what are you doing? We’re from the Stairway to Heaven and represent the imperial order. You have already plead guilty, so how dare you play tricks here?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang, who was dressed in a white robe, withdrew his gaze from his old fallen body.</p><p>That lifeless body belonging to who had been the master of the Saint Hall for more than 30 years and had never been attacked, shattered into specks of starlight and fused with the main body.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang!”</p><p>The fingers of the golden-robed man holding the edict were trembling at the moment. The two beside him were also walking on eggshells, their faces pale.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked at the decree.</p><p>Further up, he saw the judge who had condemned him for a total of 36 crimes.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang, how dare you defy my order?” the person holding the edict roared with a heart-wrenching voice.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang remained silent on the stone pathway in front of the Dead Sea. His pupils narrowed slightly.</p><p>Thud!</p><p>The headless corpse of the imperial edict bearer fell back heavily, losing all its vitality.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The golden-robed man holding the seal let out a sharp cry. “Someone come quickly! Hallmaster Xuanji…”</p><p>He could not call anyone over.</p><p>He had successfully attracted the gaze of Dao Qiongcang, who was dressed in a single robe.</p><p>The person holding the seal felt his scalp go numb. He raised the seal in his hand high and roared, “This is the will of the Five Great Holy Emperor families. You…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang closed his eyes.</p><p>Thud!</p><p>The headless corpse of the seal holder fell to the ground.</p><p>The two golden-robed men quickly turned into specks of starlight and flew into the Dead Sea with the wind, leaving no trace behind.</p><p>Clang.</p><p>The golden Sword of Justice fell to the ground and let out a trembling sound. “I-I-I…”</p><p>“Pick it up.”</p><p>The sword wielder’s legs went soft when he heard that. He bent down and picked up the Sword of Justice, wanting to look up.</p><p>Thud!</p><p>His head suddenly smashed heavily onto the ground, and blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>The terrifying force almost caused the back of his body to collapse, but it was pushed back by an invisible force.</p><p>The sword wielder kneeled down with the Sword of Justice in his hand, in front of a pair of crystal clear feet.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang!”</p><p>The sword wielder finally let out a shrill scream, “Even if you kill me, I won’t yield. You committed 36 sins. You shall fall into the Dead Sea! Even if I die today, there will be someone else coming down the Stairway of Heaven to judge you tomorrow. If he dies, there will be a third, a fourth, and it’ll be endless.”</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, your sins are unforgivable!” The heart-wrenching roar did not leave the tunnel at all. It circled around and did not attract the attention of any outsiders.</p><p>The kneeling golden-robed man began to tremble.</p><p>He tried his best to raise his head, but at most, he could only catch a glimpse of the sparkling jade light reflecting off the toes of the person in front of him through his desperately rolling eyes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
