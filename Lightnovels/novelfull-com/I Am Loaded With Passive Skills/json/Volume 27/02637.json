She only greeted them hurriedly and did not dare to delay. She said.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou has a place called the Yuan Mansion. Usually, after he is injured, he would go there to recuperate.”</p><p>“After the battle with the Holy Emperor, he was severely injured and should be in his Yuan Mansion right now.”</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao has obtained the jade talisman that leads to the Yuan Mansion from Aunt Xiang.”</p><p>“Since he said that he wouldn’t let this matter rest, he’s definitely going to the Yuan Mansion to continue to deal with Xu Xiaoshou… The main body!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s eyes blazed as she stared at the only hope left, Mei Siren. Her tone was pleading.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is in danger!”</p><p>Mei Siren could understand all this, but he was momentarily stunned. “You are…?”</p><p>Why was this little girl so familiar with Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>She even knew about the situation in the Yuan Mansion and Xu Xiaoshou like the back of her hand. Even this old man, as his teacher, was not aware about this!</p><p>“Yu Xingxing… No, Yu Zhiwen!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu recognized this person and moved closer to the old immortal Mei in fear.</p><p>He wasn’t afraid of Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>He was now very afraid of the Divine Sorceress.</p><p>His father was right. A Divine Sorceress was not someone he could deal with…</p><p>“She’s a Divine Sorceress. She’s in cahoots with Elder Dao the Flamboyant!” Cao Erzhu pointed at the witch and said.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen could only nod. “Yes, I am from the Path Division, but I am still Xu Xiaoshou’s…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was momentarily speechless.</p><p>Oh right, what am I to Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Actually, I am nothing… she whispered as her face darkened. “Friend.”</p><p>After all, Mei Siren was an experienced person.</p><p>He only glanced at the little girl’s expression a few times and after he confirmed that it was true, he understood.</p><p>“Yes…”</p><p>At this moment, Cao Erzhu seemed to have thought of something.</p><p>At that time in Qingyuan Mountain, this witch had pestered him continuously. It seemed that she wanted him to save Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>But at that time, he did not know who Xu Xiaoshou was, nor did he know what Xu Xiaoshou had to do with him…</p><p>Cao Erzhu did not know anything and did not want to get involved in any trouble.</p><p>Now that he thought about it, everything made sense!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen wanted him to help resolve this crisis?</p><p>From the looks of it, she really wasn’t an enemy?</p><p>“Yes.” Cao Erzhu nodded and pointed at Yu Zhiwen. “She’s a friend.”</p><p>Mei Siren was speechless.</p><p>He glanced at this fence sitter Cao Erzhu and decided not to pursue the topic of friend or enemy.</p><p>“Do you have a way to enter Xu Xiaoshou’s Yuan Mansion?” Mei Siren asked.</p><p>“I…” Yu Zhiwen’s red lips parted. She suddenly felt that there was an insurmountable gap between her and Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“I have no idea.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen said sadly.</p><p>Only then did she realize that each time she entered the Yuan Mansion, it was only with Xu Xiaoshou’s permission.</p><p>She had never entered on her own accord!</p><p>“But I can try to crack it.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen regained her composure quickly.</p><p>She didn’t explain further. She controlled the Qingyuan Mountain great array and locked onto the spatial traces left behind by Hallmaster Dao after he crushed the jade talisman.</p><p>Through the divine secrets, she might be able to trace the spatial coordinates of the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>Master Siren was a Sword Saint. With a single Space-Time Transition, he might be able to bring them into the Yuan Mansion and save Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>However, when the Qingyuan Mountain great array turned, Yu Zhiwen found countless spatial coordinates. They seemed to gaze at her with mocking expressions!</p><p>“How could this be…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen fell silent and lowered her head in defeat.</p><p>That’s right, how could the question setter not stop her from solving all the questions that she could think of?</p><p>“There’s no way?” Mei Siren understood something.</p><p>“Yes!” Yu Zhiwen regained her composure and her starry eyes stared disconcertingly at him. “I also know the Great God Descending Technique.”</p><p>When Mei Siren heard the words ‘Great God Descending Technique’, he felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p>However, Yu Zhiwen didn’t seem to be hostile.</p><p>“What do you mean?” He asked.</p><p>“I’ve been to the Yuan Mansion. Even though I didn’t leave any traces there, I still remember the structure of some of the things there…”</p><p>“Those were enough to form a permanent mark, as long as they haven’t been destroyed.”</p><p>“The essence of the Great God Descending Technique is to use marks to carry out a special teleportation, the human body, soul, and will included… It can be said that this is a different kind of Possession.”</p><p>“I can try to use the Great God Descending Technique to anchor the broken tower in the Yuan Mansion. I remember that there was such a thing. I won’t go over, I’ll just… I just need to open a spatial passageway and let you in.”</p><p>Mei Siren frowned when he heard this.</p><p>He could easily read the determination on the girl’s face. “What are the consequences if we do not follow the original method of the Great God Descending Technique? He asked immediately.</p><p>“There are no consequences.” Yu Zhiwen blinked and shook her head.</p><p>“Little girl, there’s no need to lie. You do not have any space attributes. How can a spatial passageway be constructed so easily?” Mei Siren shook his head and rejected her suggestion. “You want to sacrifice yourself.”</p><p>“This is the only way!” Yu Zhiwen said anxiously. “I have a way to save my life.”</p><p>“What if the broken tower you mentioned doesn’t exist, or because of Xu Xiaoshou’s cultivation, something happened to the original ‘mark’?”</p><p>Mei Siren knew his student’s personality well.</p><p>It was not just possible but highly likely that the broken tower had been destroyed by Xu Xiaoshou’s cultivation!</p><p>“If the anchor is unknown…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
