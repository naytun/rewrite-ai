Even if it saw, it would not save him.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou knew about this in the future, he would definitely have a grudge against him.</p><p>As for hiding?</p><p>The Spirit of the Dragon Apricot did not consider this.</p><p>Almighties could traverse the river of time and know everything.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou will be a great man in the future. If he sees today’s scene through the time flow, he will make a big mistake.</p><p>“The World Tree should be connected to the World Lord.”</p><p>The spirit of the Dragon Apricot sighed. At the critical moment, it still chose to save him.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The golden light received it.</p><p>Just as Zhu Yike was about to be slapped to death, he was moved away by the power of Dragon Apricot and teleported into the Apricot Realm.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>As soon as he stepped into the real world, Zhu Yike was stunned. He felt that it was so unreal.</p><p>Then, he looked up at the tall World Tree Diagram and realized that it was real. He immediately said ecstatically,</p><p>“Thank you, Senior Dragon Apricot, for saving me…”</p><p>It would be better if he did not say anything.</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence.</p><p>The Diagram Form of the Spirit of Dragon Apricot collapsed. It was so frightened that it removed its World Tree form.</p><p>“Disaster Descender!”</p><p>Indeed, the Spirit of Dragon Apricot could still sense that an accident and disaster was about to befall the real Zhu Yike.</p><p>And the person who brought all this karma was this person!</p><p>A dream within a dream?</p><p>Am I still being guided?</p><p>“Banish!”</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot did not give Zhu Yike a chance to attack at all.</p><p>Without a word, it cut off a small part of the Apricot Realm and completely abandoned it in the spacetime fragments.</p><p>A huge hole had appeared in the Apricot Realm.</p><p>It was as if a piece of the earth had been erased by an eraser, and the creatures on it were naturally lost.</p><p>Before Zhu Yike could finish speaking, the beautiful scenery of the Apricot Realm in front of him disappeared.</p><p>Then, the spacetime fragments swept over again and drowned him. He knew that the Spirit of Dragon Apricot was decisive. It had sensed something strange and even abandoned a part of the world.</p><p>“Don’t give up on me, Senior Dragon Apricot. I will die…” Zhu Yike shouted.</p><p>When his figure completely disappeared into the spacetime fragments, the last thing that was left for the Spirit of Dragon Apricot was his mournful cry, which was accompanied by a fake smile on his respectful face.</p><p>It was no different from before!</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot crashed heavily onto the ground. The illusory dragon scales on its body almost stood up.</p><p>It finally realized that these two Zhu Yike were actually the same person.</p><p>The method of chasing and killing each other was a good show for the Disaster Descender to sneak in a second time.</p><p>“Humans…”</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot gritted her teeth.</p><p>He swore that he would never trust any other human except Xu Xiaoshou, the World Lord.</p><p>At the same time, it was impossible to welcome any human into the Apricot Realm, even if it was requested by the World Lord.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>He leaped back onto the Ancestral Tree.</p><p>Looking at the missing corner of the Apricot Realm, the Spirit of Dragon Apricot was filled with lingering fear, but it let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p>There was no need to worry about the part of the world that was abandoned. It could still be grown.</p><p>It would be best if this matter could end here.</p><p>Just as it was about to enter the resting time after the big scare, the Spirit of Dragon Apricot suddenly saw…</p><p>On the crown of the Ancestral Tree, there was a Dragon Apricot that was born in the earliest batch. Even Xu Xiaoshou was not allowed to pick it. Starlight patterns that did not look like dragon patterns lit up on it.</p><p>“This pattern…”</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot moved closer and opened its eyes wide to take a look. It felt that this power was somewhat familiar.</p><p>It was the same textile dao patterns used by Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was about to wake up?</p><p>Before it could look back in the direction of the Crystal Palace, it heard a low, pious, and respectful voice.</p><p>“Big! God! Surrender! Art!”</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot tilted its head, not understanding what was going on.</p><p>At this moment, its mind was blank. It only saw the Diagram around the Dragon Apricot Seed light up and transform into a smiling Diagram.</p><p>Then, the Dragon Apricot Seed split open, and step by step, from small to big, a figure walked out…</p><p>Zhu Yike!</p><p>The expression of the Spirit of Dragon Apricot changed.</p><p>This Zhu Yike was the same as the first and second Zhu Yike. He still had that fake smile on his face.</p><p>This smiling face was exactly the same as the Diagram that appeared before Dragon Apricot Seed split open!</p><p>Zhu Yike grinned and walked from illusion to reality. He looked at the Spirit of Dragon Apricot in front of him, whose eyes were filled with shock and was already powerless to stop all this from happening. He said with a fake smile,</p><p>“Long time no see, Senior Dragon Apricot. Do you still remember me?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
