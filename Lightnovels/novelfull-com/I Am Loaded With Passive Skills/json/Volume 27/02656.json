Meanwhile, Yu Zhiwen froze when she heard those words, thinking, “Xu Xiaoshou… ghost beast…”</p><p>“Is it that little white cat?” Her starry eyes quivering, Yu Zhiwen quickly flipped over the red communication bead in her hand, as if she was looking for something.</p><p>However, it was only a one-way signal transmitter and had no ‘unsend signal’ function. It was a basic communication bead that everyone on and off the Sacred Mountain needed to use to alert the headquarters of red-clothed people when they encountered a ghost beast.</p><p>“The red-clothed people are coming!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen raised her head. She did not regret pressing the communication bead button.</p><p>Although she was worried about Xu Xiaoshou, the crack was a disaster that could endanger the entire Qingyuan Mountain and even the surrounding areas.</p><p>Calling for help was a must!</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Yu Zhiwen looked at the three Saints and said solemnly, “A ghost beast has arrived. I, Yu Zhiwen, in my position as Chief of the Path Division, implore you three Saints to put the lives of the common people first. At the very least, drag this out until the red-clothed reinforcements arrive!”</p><p>While Mei Siren and Ye Xiaotian were still analyzing the situation, the sound of heavy footsteps could be heard from the side.</p><p>The few of them looked back and saw that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had his right foot outstretched, maintaining a strange posture that suggested the conflicting desire to advance and retreat.</p><p>But he did not speak.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was taken aback. Her words were mainly meant for Ye Xiaotian and Mr. Siren.</p><p>After all, one of them came from the Holy Palace, and the other was a well-known sword master. They were born righteous, and there was a high chance that they would agree.</p><p>However, she didn’t expect that the first one to react would be the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>What was his intention?</p><p>Did he want to help the ghost beast?</p><p>“I will,” Mei Siren withdrew his gaze and said solemnly.</p><p>“Are ghost beasts stronger than Holy Emperors?” Ye Xiaotian looked interested.</p><p>“I can help you too.” Cao Erzhu followed suit.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen couldn’t figure out the intentions of Five Decays of Heaven and Man, so she could only probe by looking at him.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man snorted. “You guys deal with the ghost beast.”</p><p>“I’ll help Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile, in the Apricot Realm.</p><p>Before the Ancestral Tree Dragon Apricot moved again, its second true body switched its will first and returned to its main body. In other words, it had arrived at the cauldron of the Apricot Realm.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>His consciousness shifted and he opened his eyes.</p><p>Endless and violent explosions rang in his ears.</p><p>The second true body stood up from the alchemy cauldron. His first reaction was that he had come to the wrong place.</p><p>How could it be the Apricot Realm?</p><p>Wherever he looked, the ground cracked, the space shattered, and Path Principles surged… It was a scene of chaos!</p><p>However, it was indeed the Apricot Realm.</p><p>The Crystal Palace was toppled over and half of it fell into the spatial fragment.</p><p>The Herb Garden of Divine Farmer was already in ruins, and only a few Holy Medicine herbs were left.</p><p>The chaotic world was no longer filled with pure vitality spiritual energy, but a black fog alongside the smell of blood.</p><p>“This ghostly energy…” Heart skipping a beat, the second true body opened its eyes to look at the distant sky.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The blood-colored sound wave came right at him with immense pressure.</p><p>Other than the alchemy cauldron under him, the Crystal Palace was sent flying again. The Apricot Realm was filled with yellow sand and mist.</p><p>“No…” The second true body trembled as it stared into the distance.</p><p>In the distant void, there was a terrifying monster that he had never seen before.</p><p>Its eyes were like a tiger, its teeth like a dog’s, its waist like a wolf leopard’s, and its nine tails like a fox’s. It stepped on black clouds and had white fur all over its body. There were three blood lines on its forehead that flowed from its head to its back, disappearing at the end of its nine tails.</p><p>It was an unfamiliar yet familiar… feline ghost beast.</p><p>“Greedy the Cat Spirit?” the second true body felt that he was not mistaken, so he called out.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The nine-tailed white-haired monster stepped through ghostly energy clouds and pierced through the void, arriving in front of him in an instant.</p><p>It looked down from above. The tiny human in the alchemy cauldron was like a plaything that could be destroyed with a swipe of its claws.</p><p>However, no matter how red its eyes were and how violent and bloodthirsty it was, the nine-tailed white-haired monster was still able to stop its momentum. Its huge blood-red claws stopped in front of the alchemy cauldron.</p><p>“Thump.”</p><p>Like a sharp sword hanging in the sky, the monster gently touched the cauldron with its claws and knocked it over. The second true body rolled out from inside, and medicinal liquid flowed all over the ground…</p><p>The white-haired monster’s eyes shot out a terrifying murderous aura. Its nine tails whipped down violently, as if it was venting the anger in its heart.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Instantly, the void exploded and the Path Principles were destroyed. Everything turned into chaotic and violent primal energy.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>The monster opened its mouth again and inhaled. The flying spiritual plants, yellow sand, and energy were all swallowed into its stomach.</p><p>Engulfing Power!</p><p>The hair on the second true body stood on end. He was sure that it was the God of Greed.</p><p>But… How did Greedy the Cat Spirit suddenly mutate to this extent?</p><p>It had swallowed the Apricot Realm jade talisman in advance, and the Ancestral Tree Dragon Apricot acted as a life-saver.</p><p>Even if Dao Qiongcang wanted to attack the Greedy the Cat Spirit, the Greedy the Cat Spirit would be able to eat almost all the attacks in the form of energy…</p><p>The second true body suddenly stood up.</p><p>No matter what, he had to call the Greedy the Cat Spirit back to his senses.</p><p>At the same time, he saw someone standing above the Greedy the Cat Spirit.</p><p>That person had a jade-like face and was gentle and refined. He held a Sinan in his hand and smiled brightly.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang!” The second true body’s eyes were about to pop out. With a bang, he transformed into a violent giant and punched at the face of Elder Dao the Flamboyant.</p><p>Smack!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang simply threw a piece of meat forward and slapped it on the Golden Giant’s fist.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
