It was this young man who had come to Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>Different from other humans, this person was very intelligent and used a secret technique to avoid the Perception of the void attendant.</p><p>He had also found the true owner of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, the Ancestral Tree Dragon Apricot, and successfully awakened its spirit.</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot gave him a test.</p><p>This young man easily passed the test. On one hand, he threatened the Ancestral Tree</p><p>Dragon Apricot, while on the other hand, he was polite, neither servile nor overbearing.</p><p>As a last resort, the Spirit of Dragon Apricot could only give out a Dragon Apricot Seed for this person to pluck.</p><p>As time passed, the Spirit of Dragon Apricot still remembered…</p><p>The only impolite thing about this young man was his “insatiable greed” which seemed out of place with him.</p><p>After plucking the Dragon Apricot Seed that belonged to him, he even reached out and touched the second Dragon Apricot Seed!</p><p>Of course, the Spirit of Dragon Apricot stopped him.</p><p>This person said matter-of-factly,</p><p>“With this as a test, Senior Dragon Apricot naturally lost a Dragon Apricot Seed to me.”</p><p>“With the future as a test, Senior Dragon Apricot should gift me another Dragon Apricot Seed.”</p><p>“If it weren’t for the fact that I can’t go back to the past, I would have gotten three Dragon Apricot Seeds this time.”</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot snorted. At that time, it did not listen to the words of the present, future, and past at all. It waved her claws and dismissed that person.</p><p>The young man did not offend it anymore. Before he left, he squeezed out a fake smile and respectfully asked,</p><p>“Senior Dragon Apricot, how about we make a bet? Let’s use time as the game. With the future as the chess piece, we will not have any regrets.”</p><p>Bet?</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot, who had been asleep for a long time, was very interested. “What do you want to bet on?”</p><p>“We’ll see.”</p><p>The young man was very arrogant. He first talked about the bet. “If you (honorific form) win, I’ll help you (honorific form) steal all the luck of the Ancestral Tree, the Nine Sacrificial Osmanthus. If you (honorific form) lose, when we meet again, you have to agree to one condition of mine, even if it means taking all the Dragon Apricot Seeds.”</p><p>Stealing the Nine Sacrificial Osmanthus’ luck?</p><p>Was he worthy?</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot did not even consider the problem of losing and it agreed without hesitation and asked,</p><p>“What are we betting on?”</p><p>That person still had a respectful smile on his face as he casually left, leaving behind only this sentence,</p><p>“Senior Dragon Apricot, I bet that you (honorific form) will regret.”</p><p>…</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang?”</p><p>Within the Apricot Realm, he stared at the human in front of him as scenes flashed through his mind.</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot finally said this name.</p><p>In the long years, there were not many people who could give the Ancestral Tree Dragon Apricot such a deep memory.</p><p>Most of the time, humans would either panic and lose their sense of propriety in front of the Ancestral Tree’s power.</p><p>Or they could think of ways to avoid direct conflict and continue to steal the treasures of Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>There were very few people who could face the Ancestral Tree with such confidence, grace, and even such mystery at such a young age.</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot Tree still took the initiative to search for the Void Suppression Monument after that. It was only after retracing the time and scene that it found the corresponding name of the person on the monument. He had indeed left his name behind!</p><p>Thinking back to Dao Qiongcang’s deep smile on Abyss Island, was it not the same deep impression that Zhu Yike had left on him after crossing the Apricot Realm three times?</p><p>This was exactly what this young man would do!</p><p>He had clearly reminded him when he first arrived at the Apricot Realm, but he was certain that he definitely could not remember…</p><p>He really guessed it right!</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot felt extremely displeased.</p><p>But…</p><p>When he looked back at the container that made Dao Qiongcang rise into the Apricot Realm, which was the first batch of Dragon Apricot Seeds, the Spirit of Dragon Apricot fell silent again.</p><p>Was this not the second fruit that he was not allowed to pick?</p><p>Did he do something at that time?</p><p>Sowing the cause of that time, bearing the fruit of today.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had dared to set up a bet back then, and the bet was on this day decades later?</p><p>How could he have predicted the future?</p><p>As for the spirit…</p><p>Did it lose?</p><p>It was impossible for Dao Qiongcang to predict that the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer would belong to Xu Xiaoshou’s world.</p><p>He was just holding back out of habit so that he could return to Abyss Island in a better way.</p><p>Due to a strange combination of factors, the method that was supposed to be used against the owner of Abyss Island in the future became a method that could be used against Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Heavenly secrets, endless Transformations, endless mysteries, was that not so?</p><p>“Thank you for your kindness. So Senior Dragon Apricot still remembers me. Junior is flattered!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang straightened his expression and cupped his fists respectfully.</p><p>“Junior Dao Qiongcang brought the Ancestral Tree, Nine Sacrificial Osmanthus, to greet you. I’m here to pay you a visit.”</p><p>“I have no intention of disturbing Senior Dragon Apricot’s cultivation, but the situation is pressing. I hope Senior won’t take offense at my intrusion today.”</p><p>After a pause, Dao Qiongcang straightened his back, his expression changing slightly.</p><p>At this moment, in the eyes of the Spirit of Dragon Apricot, he was no longer the nameless nobody on Abyss Island. Instead, he rode the dragon and had an overbearing aura.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang held up the divine Sinan and looked at the Crystal Palace. He said with a half smile,</p><p>“I come here today with no ill intentions, but I can make a statement first.”</p><p>“What happened today has nothing to do with Senior!”</p><p>“Holy Divine Palace will not blame you (honorific form) for your previous relationship with Xu Xiaoshou and interfere with senior’s intention to cultivate.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
