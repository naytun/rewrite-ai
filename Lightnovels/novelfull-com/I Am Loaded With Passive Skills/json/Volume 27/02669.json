I was trying out a little trick I just learned. It’s quite useful…”</p><p>Gou Wuyue was shocked.</p><p>What sort of method was this that it could control the body of Wei Feng, the God of Killing? Even if he had just woken up and was defenseless?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang promptly looked at Wei Feng and did not give him a chance to speak. He asked.</p><p>“Let’s go to the Southern Region?”</p><p>This turn of events was too sudden!</p><p>Wei Feng had just mentally processed the battle at the entrance of the Ran Ming ruins tunnel in his mind; this involved Xu Xiaoshou and the Holy Emperor Fengtian, Feng Yujin.</p><p>He hesitated for a moment, but didn’t ask further. He nodded and said.</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>“Don’t agree too readily. A lot had happened while you were asleep.” Dao Qiongcang laughed.</p><p>“Alright…”</p><p>“It’s a big deal!” Dao Qiongcang’s tone became serious. “I’m no longer the Hallmaster.”</p><p>Wei Feng was slightly stunned when he heard this and glanced at Gou Wuyue.</p><p>He wasn’t stupid. When he saw that even the former Ruler of the white-robed people had been taken out of the Dead Sea by Dao Qiongcang, he knew that many events had happened recently.</p><p>But no matter how big the matter was, as long as Dao Qiongcang was around, he did not need to think about the past and future.</p><p>This was the far-reaching consequence of having served as the Third Emperor in the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe for many years.</p><p>He didn’t trust anyone else, but he could always trust Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>After all, his failure to intercept Xu Xiaoshou had a huge impact on him, and up until now, Dao Qiongcang had never mentioned it.</p><p>If there was an invitation, he would just accept it.</p><p>Was anything else important?</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>When Wei Feng did not ask any questions and agreed readily for the third time, Gou Wuyue couldn’t help but sigh deeply.</p><p>Elder Dao the Flamboyant was too terrifying.</p><p>He had been in power at the Sacred Mountain for more than 30 years. On the surface and in the dark, the branding he left behind was too deep.</p><p>His departure wasn’t as insignificant as the loss of a stone or that of a withered flower at the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>It was even possible that half of the sky on the Sacred Mountain would fall along with it!</p><p>“We’ll go to the Southern Region and start from scratch?”</p><p>Gou Wuyue looked intently at Elder Dao who was deep in thought and asked indirectly.</p><p>Wei Feng also glanced at him from the side. He had never considered the Southern Region as an option before.</p><p>However, his home was not the Holy Divine Palace. It did not matter where he went, it would be the same.</p><p>“It’s not a zero possibility, but there’s a chance.” Dao Qiongcang shook his head.</p><p>“Oh? You have people in the Southern Region, or have you made arrangements?” Gou Wuyue showed just the right amount of curiosity.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang knew what he wanted to ask. He laughed lightly and said, “I know a very capable young man who had started from scratch. His background is clean and he has no criminal record. He has even laid a good foundation for us.”</p><p>“Who is it?” Gou Wuyue and Wei Feng said in unison.</p><p>“You guys have never heard of him. You won’t know even if I tell you…”</p><p>“Who is it?” They persisted.</p><p>“It’s a Divine secret, I can’t reveal it…”</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang! You brat!”</p><p>“Uh, alright. His name is Nangong Youshu.”</p><p>Qingyuan Mountain shattered.</p><p>The three Saints were sent flying.</p><p>The ghost beast Greedy the Cat Spirit seemed to know how to avoid self harm; it flexed its sharp claws as it stepped onto the void.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>It changed its direction and disappeared into the spatial fragment.</p><p>“Blood…”</p><p>“Flesh…”</p><p>“Hungry…”</p><p>Through the vague telepathic connection established by their long-term intimate relationship, the second true body read the desire in Greedy the Cat Spirit’s scarlet eyes at the last moment.</p><p>It wanted to devour flesh and blood!</p><p>It needed a lot of food!</p><p>It even had extremely high requirements for food ingredients. After all, it had swallowed so many types of Holy Medicine in the Apricot Realm…</p><p>In an instant, thousands of possibilities flashed through the second true body’s mind, and it quickly locked onto one.</p><p>“It is a place filled with a large number of ingredients rich in spiritual energy and has a large number of high-level flesh and blood. It can delay the feeling of hunger…”</p><p>“There’s only one place around here! ”</p><p>“Jade Capital City!”</p><p>But…</p><p>Was that a place where ghost beasts could enter?</p><p>The second true body turned to look at Ye Xiaotian, who still struggled to pull on his pants over his short legs, and shouted.</p><p>“Master Dean, stop it! Bring it back!”</p><p>Ah, such bad luck!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou you’re really annoying!</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was so furious that he withdrew his legs into his internal world instantly. He twisted his upper body and pulled out the Power Upanishad Formation from his bloody intestines.</p><p>“Spatial transmission…”</p><p>However, he had only gathered half of his power. He wanted to move Greedy the Cat Spirit out of the spatial fragment.</p><p>With a whoosh, the thick mass of Holy Power suddenly disappeared.</p><p>“It had all been swallowed!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what kind of monster did you release?!” Ye Xiaotian shouted anxiously.</p><p>What kind of ghost beast was this?</p><p>All of his spiritual techniques were useless!</p><p>It could even ignore the Spatial Upanishad and forcefully transform it into energy and swallow it. Wouldn’t Ye Xiaotian only be left with a five-foot-long body as fodder if he were to face this monster?</p><p>“I will give it a try.”</p><p>Mei Siren could tell that this matter was one of great urgency for Xu Xiaoshou. As soon as his sword image was activated, he used a different strategy with the Taicheng Sword and launched the Fantasy Sword Technique..</p><p>Amid the spatial fragment, plum blossoms drifted down in an attempt to divert Greedy the Cat Spirit and make it turn around.</p><p>Who would have thought that the monster would open its mouth and once again swallowed everything up.</p><p>With a sizzle, all of the plum blossoms formed from the Sword Will and morph forms of Sword Energy were swallowed.</p><p>The illusion that he had just started to outline disappeared completely.</p><p>Once the Fantasy Sword Technique was shattered, it would be powerless even to stop a chicken. How could it restrain the out of control Greedy the Cat Spirit?</p><p>“Ha…”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man, who had long fled into the distance, shook his head and laughed.</p><p>If it could even swallow the Penetrating Divine Senses, how could it not swallow the sword energy and the Holy Power?</p><p>Only he knew how terrifying the Body of Devour was.</p><p>The only reason why he didn’t want to fight was because he had swallowed Ye Xiao on Abyss Island. What was the point?</p><p>Wasn’t it to not alert the Holy Divine Palace and not expose himself too early?</p><p>Now that the ghost beast had lost control, it could not learn to restrain itself at all. It was equivalent to unleashing 120% of the Body of Devour’s functionality.</p><p>It had also accumulated a large amount of medicinal power in its body. After it came out, it had even eaten high-level powers such as the God Punishment Tribulation and the spatial Holy Power and other high-level elites’ power…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
