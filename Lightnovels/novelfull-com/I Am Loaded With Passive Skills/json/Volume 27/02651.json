It was only right that it was scolded.</p><p>But…</p><p>Why did he scold it?</p><p>To move one more person out of the Apricot Realm and bringing away the precious items, wasn’t this a preparatory operation move?</p><p>However, before it could ask, the second true body scolded it again.</p><p>“Use your pig brain, okay? Even I am afraid of that Elder Dao. How dare you treat him like a fool?”</p><p>“He hasn’t entered the Apricot Realm yet, and you’ve already emptied out all the precious things. Would that not be a clear indication to him that we’ve already packed up and left in advance?”</p><p>“Anyone with a brain would realize that something is amiss, right?”</p><p>“Did the Ancestral Tree get infested? What were you thinking of?!”</p><p>“I… the Dragon Apricot choked and could not speak. At this time, it also realized that things had gone awry.</p><p>But how many years had it been since it had last been reprimanded by others?</p><p>Anyone who was provoked would get angry. How could a dignified Ancestral Tree tolerate a human scolding it in this way?</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot was the first to shout. Its branches clamped on Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth and interrupted his filthy insults. Then, with eyes ablaze with fury, it asked.</p><p>“You’re not at fault when you accuse someone of a crime?”</p><p>“Since you want to move on in this world and forget about the kindness you’ve received; you want to avoid being in the spotlight but you can’t put a stop to it. You think you’re majestic and fierce, but that served only to deceive yourself. You’re now in a sorry state and should be content instead…”</p><p>“That so-called foolproof escape plan, have you ever thought that its essence was just a flashy trick. it’s just a delaying action. Since we’ve left the Apricot Realm, when can we return?”</p><p>“How long would it take, ten days, three months, half a year, to return to the Apricot Realm?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, have you thought about this?”</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot was so incensed that its entire dragon body trembled. It roared loudly.</p><p>“So tell me!”</p><p>“What’s wrong with me bringing people out?”</p><p>The spacetime fragments quieted down for a moment. There was only the mass of brilliant golden light that quivered and then dissipated all directions.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Why was it so quiet?</p><p>He can’t outtalk me?</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot Tree suddenly realized that it was not that Xu Xiaoshou did not want to retort, but that his mouth was covered by a branch. It hurriedly released the branch.</p><p>As soon as the branch was released, the second true body’s voice, that had been suppressed to the extreme, jumped out.</p><p>“I don’t understand what you’re saying!”</p><p>At that moment, the Spirit of Dragon Apricot felt as if it had just wasted all its efforts. It was so angry that it almost vomited blood.</p><p>Fortunately, the second true body at least understood part of what it said.</p><p>Although the Spirit of Dragon Apricot had said a lot of useless things, at least it had given a clear explanation in its first few sentences.</p><p>He had not taken into consideration whether he could still go back.</p><p>The Apricot Realm that had been handed over easily to Dao Qiongcang. This included the fact that Lei Xi’er and the semi-saint person were still inside to help keep up the authenticity of the escape plan…</p><p>And all of this was based on the gamble that he would awaken quickly and that Dao Qiongcang would not attack them.</p><p>Was that even possible?</p><p>The second true body suddenly realized that there was a huge problem!</p><p>However, when he thought of this d*mned Dragon Apricot, who had clearly done something wrong, and still dared to criticize him, he was furious.</p><p>“Since you really want to move out completely, would I not agree to it if you told me?”</p><p>“Can’t we just move out together?”</p><p>After a pause, the second true body suddenly thought of something and was furious.</p><p>“Forget about moving. You moved half of it and left the evidence behind, but you didn’t bring Greedy the Cat Spirit.”</p><p>“Did you want Elder Dao to realize that something is wrong and let Greedy the Cat Spirit face the music?”</p><p>“You…” The Spirit of Dragon Apricot flew into a rage when it heard that. It eyes were red with anger. “You asked me to do it, you said to leave Greedy the Cat Spirit behind!”</p><p>“But I didn’t ask you to bring Lei Xi’er out… Hmm?” He suddenly stopped.</p><p>All the violent thoughts in his mind dispersed and he calmed down.</p><p>“Wait, wait…”</p><p>“Let’s have a temporary truce!”</p><p>“Senior Dragon Apricot, something seems wrong.”</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot seemed to have woken up from a dream among the spacetime fragments. After it looked around, it also realized something.</p><p>“There is indeed something wrong…”</p><p>The man and the tree were shocked and both spoke at the same time.</p><p>“Blood tree Guidance?”</p><p>“That d*mned Deva?”</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot looked down and then looked at Xu Xiaoshou again. There was unconcealable shock in its eyes.</p><p>It had even more thoughts…</p><p>During its era, whenever any accident that was beyond the control of the Holy Emperor of the current era occurred…</p><p>Most of them had the shadow of the blood tree behind them.</p><p>The blood tree, one of the Nine Great Ancestral Trees, specialized in the power of guidance. These were divided into seven levels-hunger, obsession, slaughter, death, degeneration, asexuality, and nutrients!</p><p>Under the guidance of these seven levels, if one was unable to detect it, those of the same level or even those of a higher level would be mercilessly swallowed as nutrients.</p><p>The peak period of the blood tree’s power of guidance was during the Ancestral Era, when it obtained the support of the Blood World Pearl. This item had just appeared, its abilities were unknown as yet, and was in a full state.</p><p>The two complemented each other and this led to the Nine Great Ancestral Trees being almost completely devoured. The entire continent was almost paralyzed and became the only World Tree.</p><p>Later, the Ancestor of the technique took action and broke the blood tree into seven branches and sealed most of the power of the Blood World Pearl. Only then was the continental level disease suppressed.</p><p>But it was also because of this…</p><p>The Ancestor of the technique had been corrupted!</p><p>The Dragon Apricot had lived for a long time and naturally knew the true history.</p><p>After it calmed down, it did not hesitate to tell Xu Xiaoshou all these things. Then, it reminded him solemnly,</p><p>“Beware of the Deva!”</p><p>“Beware of the person you mentioned!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
