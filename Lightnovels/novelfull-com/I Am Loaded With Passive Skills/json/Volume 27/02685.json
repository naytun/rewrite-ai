After Xu Xiaoshou gave an imperceptible nod, he stepped out of the Spatial Upanishad array diagram.</p><p>“Everyone, come and take a look!”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi pointed at the ground beneath Ye Xiaotian’s feet.</p><p>Fang Wenxin held his breath and took a closer look. It was really vivid and dazzling…</p><p>It was really terrifying!</p><p>When Ye Xiaotian’s eyes shifted, he could even see Senior Fang from the red-clothed people’s nose hair sticking out!</p><p>The Cutting Path Stage and the higher void level were no longer afraid to go forward. They rushed over and formed a huge encirclement.</p><p>There were dozens of people here, and there were even figures that flew over from afar…</p><p>Apart from the violent Greedy the Cat Spirit that was excluded, Mei Siren who practiced the Ancient Sword Technique also had a problem with the integration.</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators gathered at the Southern Zone gate and the place turned into a bustling marketplace!</p><p>Ye Xiaotian felt as if he was a prized meat put on display before them. He felt extremely uncomfortable being stared at by so many fervent gazes!</p><p>“Did you get a good look at this Path pattern? What he spoke about was the concept of teleportation. I remember that the first space attributes of the Spirit Array Caster. His spatial ring was developed from this Dao pattern.”</p><p>“This whole… Look at this white-haired guy. What he has mastered is a 100% Power Upanishad Formation. It’s perfect!”</p><p>“Take a look at mine. It’s dim and dull and does not work anymore…”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi spoke for quite some time. He shifted and switched to the space attributes of the Great Path Diagram.</p><p>However, what he mastered was even more inferior than Xu Xiaoshou’s. It was obvious that space attributes were not his main cultivation.</p><p>“Yes, that makes sense.”</p><p>“Elder Zhong is right. It’s definitely not zero or one. There should be such a visualization process in the middle. Now I understand!”</p><p>“Elder Zhong, I have a question. How do I cultivate this Great Path Diagram?” Some of them were eager to learn and had already started asking questions.</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi was stunned when he heard that. He immediately frowned and scratched his head. “It’s very easy.”</p><p>“Hmm?” Everyone looked forward to his reply.</p><p>“How should I put it? Convergence, circulation, feeling… When you need it, it will appear. My method is to follow the normal Power Upanishad Formation and let the power flow under my feet…”</p><p>“Oh? I’ll let it flow too…”</p><p>“You don’t seem to be able to make it appear. Let me try!”</p><p>“You guys can’t do it. Watch me!”</p><p>The area turned into a lively marketplace again.</p><p>At the Southern Zone gate, a ghostly illusion appeared as Xi materialized.</p><p>He was stunned when he saw the scene before him.</p><p>What he saw was Senior Fang and Ye Xiaotian who stood side by side; Elder Yu who pushed another person as he said, “Don’t push!”. Then he climbed onto the back of the person next to him, while the rest of the people surrounded the afro. It was a scene of pure mayhem…</p><p>“Oh, it must be a nightmare!”</p><p>Xi shook his head and slapped himself hard as he wanted this terrifying scene to end.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“I’m not dreaming!”</p><p>His gaze turned serious and as the pain hit his face, Xi realized that this was not a dream, nor was it the Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>The people from the Holy Divine Palace and the Saint Servant had really gathered all the itinerant cultivators inside and outside Jade Capital City together and had a collective ‘poop’ at the Southern City Gate!</p><p>“And in broad daylight…”</p><p>“What are you guys doing!”</p><p>In fact, it was so ridiculous that no one even noticed his approach. Xi squeezed his way through the crowd, and soon saw a group of Spiritual Cultivators who were engrossed in the study of the Power Upanishad Formation.</p><p>Oh, so you’re studying this. Good, good…</p><p>“Stop squeezing! Get lost!”</p><p>“Hey, aren’t you the Chief of the Transformation Division… ancient swordsman, scram!”</p><p>“Go away, this is my space!”</p><p>Xi pushed his way through and was shoved aside by a group of people.</p><p>He looked around in shock, and then he saw Master Siren, who stood at the outermost edge and could not get a word in.</p><p>“Si…”</p><p>Xi subconsciously wanted to greet him.</p><p>He quickly realized that he was from the First Pavilion in the Sky, he was an enemy!</p><p>Heavens, what had happened to this world?</p><p>How was it that everyone had gathered together and were in the midst of such an animated discussion?</p><p>Did I miss something, or did you all betray the Sacred Mountain behind my back? Was this due to the Guidance of Hallmaster Dao?</p><p>Xi, who felt abandoned by Hallmaster Dao and had joined Hallmaster Xuanji’s camp, wanted to clarify everything.</p><p>He saw the wry smile on Master Siren’s face.</p><p>The other party spread out his hands as if to indicate that the ancient swordsman did not need to say anything more. Because he did not belong to this group at all and he could not force his way in.</p><p>Xi felt as if he had gone deaf!</p><p>All the sounds were isolated from his brain.</p><p>He racked his brains as he tried to figure out the cause of this phenomenon until he suddenly caught sight of Xu Xiaoshou, who could barely be seen among the crowd…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>Yes, he was here too!</p><p>Then that made sense. He must have done something!</p><p>The reason why Xi noticed Xu Xiaoshou was because he suddenly stood up and said.</p><p>“I don’t agree with Elder Zhong!”</p><p>His resolute voice was like a clear stream of water that gushed forth in the midst of this noisy crowd of people in the market.</p><p>This was because no one else spoke in such an absolute tone among the cacophony of sounds. Even Elder Zhong’s voice was a little uncertain.</p><p>“Who are you? Why don’t you agree… Uh, Lord Shou?”</p><p>“What are your thoughts, Lord Shou? Hurry up, tell us, we’re all ears!”</p><p>“This! This! Look here, I have a small stool. Lord Shou, stand on it…”</p><p>“I can f*cking fly!” The second true body was amused.</p><p>Everyone’s doubts turned into expectations.</p><p>If the Elemental Divine Envoy was a teacher, his words would bring about enlightenment.</p><p>Lord Shou was an assistant. In short, he was definitely not one of the students below. After all, he knew the Great Path Diagram too.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
