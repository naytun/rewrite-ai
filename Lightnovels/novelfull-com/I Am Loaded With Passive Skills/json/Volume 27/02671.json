After she finished everything quickly, there was only one last step left and that was to announce it to the world.</p><p>It was better than nothing.</p><p>At this point, everyone knew that the position of Hallmaster of the Sacred Mountain had been replaced.</p><p>Dao Xuanji was indeed not a person who liked extravagance.</p><p>To her, the ceremony itself was not important. What was important was to prove herself in front of that person.</p><p>This was enough.</p><p>After she sent off the representatives of the aristocratic families, Dao Xuanji only brought one person with her and turned to enter the hall.</p><p>This was not her first time to enter the Saint Hall.</p><p>After she became the Third Emperor, she had attended a few meetings here.</p><p>However, at that time, she had joined the Council of Ten as an outsider. Now, she was the leader of the council and the owner of the Saint Hall.</p><p>These two were very different.</p><p>From the pillars to the decorations, from the silver table to the chairs…</p><p>Soon, Dao Xuanji stopped in front of the Hallmaster’s seat. She gazed at the chair for a long time and then said indifferently.</p><p>“I want this changed.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Jiang Nayi ran forward and hurriedly removed the seat.</p><p>Then, he took out a brand new, regal golden dragon throne from his ring and replaced the old seat.</p><p>After it was done, he used his wide sleeves to wipe away the non-existent dust from the back of the chair to the armrests and the cushion.</p><p>He paused for a moment, then he laid on the ground and continued to wipe the floor with his sleeve.</p><p>Only then did he turn around and with a fawning smile, said.</p><p>“Hallmaster Xuanji, please…”</p><p>It was only when Dao Xuanji moved to the golden dragon throne and sat down that Jiang Nayi’s heart finally settled down.</p><p>The Jiang Clan from the Northern Region of Pu Xuan had been in a decline ever since the Saint Fall of demi-saint Jiang Buyi in Sky City.</p><p>In just over a short period of a month, this dignified Demi-Saint aristocratic family was almost devoured by all factions.</p><p>However, a centipede will not die.</p><p>After all, the Jiang Clan had contributed greatly to the destruction of the higher void Lei Family.</p><p>Jiang Nayi braced himself and endured all the pressure. He used his brother’s name and wrote a letter to Dao Xuanji.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Dao Xuanji came personally!</p><p>Jiang Nayi had been a good-for-nothing since his youth and was despised everywhere he went.</p><p>He was not as good as the others in his Spiritual Cultivation. He was frequently scolded by his brother, Jiang Buyi, who was known as a genius.</p><p>After he became an adult, he was pushed out of the family and separated from the core. After that, he started to run his own business and honed himself.</p><p>In fact, Jiang Nayi was handsome and did not think that he was trash.</p><p>It was just like the bright moon in the sky and stars without light, like the Dao Clan’s Xuanji and Sword Deity Wen Ting.</p><p>Dao Xuanji personally went to the Jiang Clan in the Northern Region of Pu Xuan. Everyone in the family felt threatened and was inexplicably terrified.</p><p>Jiang Nayi had honed his skills for a lifetime. After he returned to the clan, he had long become crafty and had a glib tongue.</p><p>Looking at the essence through appearances, he could tell that Dao Xuanji was like him. She had great ambitions, but she also lacked an opportunity.</p><p>Now that his elder brother, Jiang Buyi had died in the Saint Fall, Dao Xuanji wanted to rise up but lacked help…</p><p>Wasn’t this a perfect match!</p><p>Jiang Nayi suppressed the opinions of his clan members and and took over the discussion. With his glib tongue, he talked through the night and convinced Dao Xuanji.</p><p>His blueprint of ‘taking root in the Dao Clan and borrowing the power of the Northern Region’ won over Xuanji’s heart.</p><p>The Northern Region was in a mess and there was only a highly disorganized Heavenly Covenant in place.</p><p>If a giant hand reached out and gathered all the scattered power together, it would be a force that was not weaker than the Eastern Region or the Southern Region.</p><p>If he could borrow this power, even if he didn’t have a deep foundation in the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe and had no one to support him, Dao Xuanji could lure the outside to attack the inside and take it down before she planned for any development.</p><p>Furthermore, Dao Xuanji was not weak, so it was impossible for her not to have any support.</p><p>Therefore, the branding that belonged to Dao Qiongcang on the Holy Mountain was removed bit by bit…</p><p>Ten years!</p><p>It would only take ten years, or even less!</p><p>The Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe would belong to Xuanji and not Qiongcang!</p><p>Both of them were from the Dao Clan, so the people at the top would not have any objections.</p><p>Jiang Nayi had won Dao Xuanji’s favor through this all-night conversation and successfully secured a new semi-saint person for his family.</p><p>Although Jiang Nayi felt that his talent was still a little lacking and he was not confident that he could pass the saint calamity…</p><p>This was not important!</p><p>What mattered was that the Jiang Clan from the Northern Region of Pu Xuan had successfully become the first spear Dao Xuanji used to rule the Northern Region.</p><p>He, Jiang Nayi, had also succeeded in becoming Dao Xuanji’s right-hand man.</p><p>And the symbol of the success of this plan was the golden dragon throne that he personally crafted – the one that Dao Xuanji sat on!</p><p>“Jiang Buyi, you once said that I am useless…”</p><p>“But how would you know that I had the ability to take over the banner of the demi-saint Jiang Clan and clean up the mess you left behind?”</p><p>Jiang Nayi gritted his teeth and tears welled up in his eyes.</p><p>He knew that from this moment on, the past humiliation, the criticisms of the family, and the curses of the outside world were all like fleeting clouds.</p><p>His forbearance, his schemes, and his strength were displayed in this service!</p><p>What was this bullsh*t …</p><p>Ha!</p><p>In the presence of Jiang Nayi, don’t you have do as I say?</p><p>They were just flashy and strong on the outside but weak on the inside. They were all trash!</p><p>“Jiang Nayi.” Dao Xuanji who sat on the golden dragon throne suddenly called him.</p><p>“Ah!” Jiang Nayi instantly bowed and spoke softly. “Hallmaster Xuanji, do you have any orders?”</p><p>“Call the guard.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
