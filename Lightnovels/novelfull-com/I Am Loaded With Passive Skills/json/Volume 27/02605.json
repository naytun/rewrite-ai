We didn’t even get a proper glimpse of the person’s face. Was it even a human…”</p><p>“In the spatial fragment, we were plunged into absolute darkness.”</p><p>Absolute?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang mused.</p><p>Spatial fragments were inherently dark, but spiritual senses allowed for telepathic communication.</p><p>Through these senses, one could still perceive spatial storms, and spatial blades, thereby avoiding danger.</p><p>Absolute darkness meant nothing could be done at all…</p><p>Huang Zhao nodded in agreement and added, “I felt the same as Old Jin. We couldn’t see anything, and lost track of our comrades’ positions completely.”</p><p>“Yes!” Jin Feng, clearly hot-tempered, flared up again, ready to kick Zhu Yike a couple more times, but was restrained just in time.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, Jin Feng said with hatred, “In just that instant of absolute darkness, when I woke up, more than half of my brothers who fought alongside me were missing.”</p><p>“I broke through the darkness the fastest and immediately found Brother Huang, luckily not far away, within my spiritual senses’ range.”</p><p>“He was still curled up, and I helped him break free from the darkness.”</p><p>Curled up, meaning in a defensive position waiting for aid… Dao Qiongcang nodded, understanding their professional terminology. “Then?”</p><p>Jin Feng hesitated, then awkwardly said, “Couldn’t see anything. Maybe he was scared by our combat prowess and disappeared.”</p><p>“And the others?” Dao Qiongcang asked.</p><p>Jin Feng shook his head, his gaze heavy with sorrow. “When I woke up, there were few uninjured people around. After saving Brother Huang, the rest…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang waited silently.</p><p>“Died.”</p><p>Jin Feng struggled to utter the final word.</p><p>He suddenly erupted, brandishing a golden spear and aiming it at Zhu Yike’s head, “I’ll kill you, you bastard…”</p><p>Huang Zhao held him back, turning him around to calm him down.</p><p>“You speak,” Dao Qiongcang turned to the more composed Huang Zhao.</p><p>“I was in a defensive stance waiting for help, so the darkness couldn’t invade me. I think if Old Jin hadn’t broken through the darkness, none of our team would have survived.”</p><p>Huang Zhao paused, then added, “Yes, we were the team attacking the Chief of the Path Division, but actually targeting the Red Flower Bandit, mostly composed of Higher Void-level fighters.”</p><p>Pointing to Du Liang, he continued, “They were in charge of defense, protecting Yu Zhiwen, but ended up guarding the team attacking Red Flower Bandit, mostly Cutting Path Stage fighters.”</p><p>“We were sealed into different enclosed spaces.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang recognized that Huang Zhao’s ability to provide an explanation, despite its complexity, was commendable considering the circumstances of Sky Stealing.</p><p>He urged him to continue with his eyes.</p><p>Huang Zhao, aware of what Hallmaster Dao wanted to hear, thought for a moment and said, “In the defensive position, I sensed something sinister and evil…”</p><p>“Specifically, as Old Jin described, in ‘absolute darkness,’ there were forces of corruption targeting the physical body, spiritual source, and even lifespan.”</p><p>“Also, my soul was attacked. Unable to breach my defenses, he shifted his focus to others.”</p><p>“The intensity of the attacks was immense! Overwhelmingly so! I could withstand it, but others might not.”</p><p>“The result…”</p><p>Huang Zhao wanted to say it was as Old Jin described, that upon escaping the absolute darkness, they saw their fallen comrades.</p><p>His gaze happened to fall on Du Liang.</p><p>Du Liang’s face seemed itchy. He scratched it, peeling off a piece of skin, and blood flowed profusely.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang could basically reconstruct the battle within the spatial fragment.</p><p>A group of white-clothed people, without even seeing the enemy, were severely injured or killed, making their description of the battle seem vague and elusive.</p><p>“Du Liang?” He approached the Cutting Path Stage cultivator, who was scratching his skull after peeling back his scalp.</p><p>“Heh heh…”</p><p>Du Liang, still laughing mirthlessly, raised his head at the sound, his lone remaining eye unfocused. He then quickly clutched his head.</p><p>“Ahhh!”</p><p>He let out a miserable scream.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang moved his Divine Sinan and a starlight swept across.</p><p>The Great Purification Technique!</p><p>Caught by the spell, rationality returned to Du Liang’s chaotic eyes. He stared blankly for a moment. “Hallmaster Dao?”</p><p>“What did you experience?”</p><p>“I…” Du Liang began to speak but then scanned his condition through spiritual senses, finding his foundational roots were collapsing, and his spiritual source was dissipating.</p><p>Realizing his end was near, he collapsed to the ground, “I…”</p><p>“You saw him. He let you come back to tell me something?” Dao Qiongcang finished for him.</p><p>Jin Feng and Huang Zhao were stunned.</p><p>Saw him?</p><p>How was that possible?</p><p>Du Liang was only at the Cutting Path Stage…</p><p>But on second thought, if it wasn’t deliberate, how could Du Liang, a Cutting Path cultivator, have survived such a deathtrap?</p><p>Jin Feng felt a chill.</p><p>He wondered if his survival was not due to his combat strength or the speed with which he broke through the darkness.</p><p>At least he was alive…</p><p>He patted his head, trying to forget the fear, glaring fiercely at Zhu Yike once more.</p><p>It was all this bastard’s fault!</p><p>He must have colluded with the enemy!</p><p>Beside him, Du Liang seemed to be reminded of dreadful memories by Hallmaster Dao’s words, his eyes filled with fear. “He, he…”</p><p>He stammered for a long time but couldn’t speak, as if resisting himself.</p><p>“Can’t say or don’t dare to say?” Dao Qiongcang’s eyes gleamed.</p><p>Du Liang glanced at his ruined body, feeling he had only a few words left.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
