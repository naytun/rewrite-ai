You guys go in, but remember, you only have three breaths of time.”</p><p>“Once the time is up, the spatial passageway will definitely shatter. If you are still unable to enter, you will definitely fall into space… No, spacetime fragments.”</p><p>“His Yuan Mansion has changed, its form is similar to Abyss Island. You should be clear about the dangers if you lose your way after you fail to force your way through.”</p><p>She then looked at Cao Erzhu and did not explain further, because this might have taken forever. “Don’t force yourself. If you can’t enter, exit immediately.”</p><p>“Oh.” Cao Erzhu nodded and tactfully refrained from asking, even though he had many questions.</p><p>“Are you ready?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen formed a seal with her hands and looked at the two people in front of her; she did not dare to look at the third person.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man, Mei Siren and Cao Erzhu nodded.</p><p>In an instant, the three people’s gazes were focused on the Pearl Gem Star Eyes that seemed to be filled with vast stars.</p><p>They saw the stars that shone brilliantly as Yu Zhiwen’s hand held the astrolabe Guilan and completed the magic.</p><p>“Star studded, Void Spirit Heaven!”</p><p>Weng!</p><p>Qingyuan Mountain trembled.</p><p>Dao patterns appeared everywhere and the wind and clouds howled in the void. They gathered into a pillar of light that shot into the sky and pierced through the vacuum.</p><p>Soon, a passage that allow people to enter and exit opened up in this pillar of light.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s body trembled violently, she gritted her teeth and sweat poured down her face.</p><p>“Go in quickly!”</p><p>Mei Siren didn’t say anything and stepped into the spatial passageway with his sword. Xu Xiaoshou was in danger, so it was better for him to get there as soon as possible.</p><p>Cao Erzhu hurriedly followed. He didn’t want to follow behind that creepy orange man. This person was too scary.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man stepped into the spatial passageway.</p><p>Suddenly, he looked inside and seemed to have seen what was on the other side of the passage. He stopped.</p><p>“Ghost beast aura…”</p><p>In the end, he retreated!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s heart trembled.</p><p>What she feared most was this Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>As she stood beside him, she felt as if her life was about to end as he stared intently at her.</p><p>She couldn’t understand why Xu Xiaoshou would have such a friend…</p><p>The most important thing was that such a terrifying person had come uninvited. Master Siren almost drew his sword, but he actually came to save people!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was skeptical about this.</p><p>However, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man took out the Dragon Apricot branch, and made them feel much more at ease.</p><p>However, at this critical juncture, he had retreated?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s heart thumped. She gritted her teeth and said with difficulty, “Hurry up and go in. There’s no time. I can’t hold on any longer!”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man shook his head slowly.</p><p>He had lost all desire to enter the spatial passageway to save them!</p><p>On the contrary, through the mask, he stared at the little girl’s starry eyes with a strange and unclear gaze and said in a deep voice.</p><p>“Lei Family’s eyes?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s hands trembled when she heard this, and she almost couldn’t maintain the spatial passageway.</p><p>At this time, not to mention the three breaths!</p><p>She had already dragged out for four to five breaths of time, and she had seriously exceeded the time limit and overdrawn her strength.</p><p>“No. It’s not…”</p><p>“Not the Lei Family’s Eyes? No! You are one of the Lei Family’s Eyes and you are a sinner!” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s gaze was cold.</p><p>“I… am… not.”</p><p>Before Yu Zhiwen could finish her words, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man suddenly slapped her trembling hand.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>The seal broke.</p><p>The Guilan flew out.</p><p>In the air, the crumbling spatial passageway exploded into spiritual energy with a bang.</p><p>All her efforts had been for nothing.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was stunned. “Why…”</p><p>She looked at the abominator in front of her in disbelief, her eyes filled with fear. “You’re not here to save anyone!”</p><p>“It does not matter anymore…” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man stared at her. “What’s important is that you’re a sinner!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was knocked to the ground by the terrifying and oppressive aura. She felt that the world had turned gray as countless demons and ghosts pounced on her.</p><p>Her delicate body trembled uncontrollably, but she stubbornly raised her head.</p><p>“I’m not a sinner!”</p><p>“I’m not a sinner!!!”</p><p>“Heh, no? Then how did you get your Lei Family’s Eyes?” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man laughed coldly.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s eyes were filled with tears of fear as she muttered, “The Lei family has ties with the Demi-Saint Family…”</p><p>She suddenly realized that there was something fishy going on. This person was forcing her to reveal her secret, so she quickly kept quiet.</p><p>Weng!</p><p>In the next second, Yu Zhiwen’s vision was replaced by three huge gray spots. The gray spots spun and disappeared, converged into one point, shattered her entire world.</p><p>“Continue.”</p><p>“The Lei family… and the Demi-Saint Family… marriage… some of my ancestors… have the Lei family blood ties…”</p><p>Lei family bloodline…</p><p>“Funny, that you are not a member of the Lei family!”</p><p>“I am considered… half… of the Lei family…”</p><p>“Then you would have died long ago. How could you still be alive? Oh, wait, who told you about these things?”</p><p>“My… Supreme Master…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
