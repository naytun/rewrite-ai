Cao Erzhu was instantly hit by the backlash and was blasted by 120% of his own strength. Blood gushed out of his seven orifices, he felt dizzy and almost fainted.</p><p>“Boom boom boom…”</p><p>Rocks flew backward, and the spiritual ores were suspended in the sky.</p><p>Cao Erzhu was engaged in his own battle and Mei Siren was also busy with his own problems.</p><p>When the Chaotic Spiritual Sky appeared, his sharp eyes immediately noticed it. Then, he used the All Things are Swords to retrieve the head of the array wheel that Xu Xiaoshou had entrusted to him.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang seemed to have forgotten to stop this move?</p><p>No!</p><p>He didn’t forget!</p><p>He only took advantage of the time that he had taken to retrieve a useless array wheel that took his focus off the Taicheng Sword… and sprang into action!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Mei Siren fell into the deep abyss at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>The Taicheng Sword was constantly being sucked into the sky. Even the connection between the sword wielder and the sword itself could not be retrieved.</p><p>“Pfft…”</p><p>Mei Siren who was determined to retrieve the Taicheng Sword even unto death, had completely forgotten to protect himself. He spat out blood when his back slammed into the boulder.</p><p>This boulder was not any ordinary boulder that was on Qingyuan Mountain. It was a golden, angular stone that had complicated divine path patterns engraved on it.</p><p>“Eight Gold Paperweight, Qiongqi bites the Sword!”</p><p>While Mei Siren was still underground, Dao Qiongcang smiled and threw out the remaining seven golden stones from his spatial ring.</p><p>The eight golden stones revolved around the Taicheng Sword and guided thousands of Qingyuan Mountain’s original stones. They formed a spiritual foundation with the dense power of the stars and imprisoned one of the Five Great Divine Instruments of Chaos.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>When the phantom of Qiongqi appeared from the eight golden stones, the Taicheng Sword was pressed down in the sky.</p><p>Then, it was picked up by the giant beast and thrown out. The giant beast repeated this action over and over again!</p><p>The Taicheng Sword resisted frantically.</p><p>The Qiongqi crazily threw the sword.</p><p>The two entered into an endless cycle.</p><p>“Chaotic divine instrument, use the chaotic extreme fury to suppress it.”</p><p>“If this is your saber, with one utterance of the Heavenly Unravel, it would turn around and leave.”</p><p>“Of course it was not… So in this situation, what should Master Siren do?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang rubbed his chin and thought hard. In the end, he smiled and said, “Anyway, I’m stupid. I can’t figure out any other way to break this deadlock.”</p><p>Mei Siren was stunned.</p><p>This kid had calculated everything to death!</p><p>Not only did he predict that he would grab the array wheel first and relax his control of the Taicheng Sword.</p><p>He also knew that the Taicheng Sword was not close to him, so this was an opportunity for him to take advantage of it.</p><p>What mattered most was that even if others knew about it, they would not be able to do anything about it, but he could make use of it. He even had a way to pin down the Taicheng Sword and left him defenseless.</p><p>The ancient swordsman had lost his sword…</p><p>“Oh, there’s still the Swordless Sword Technique.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang seemed to have been awakened. He laughed and teased. “Master Siren, have you cultivated your Swordless Sword Technique to the same high level as the Heart Sword Technique?”</p><p>Mei Siren’s face became angry and his eyes narrowed.</p><p>The sword image flew out. As he protected himself, he chanted.</p><p>“Three Streams of Red Plum Blossoms, Falling Flower World!”</p><p>In an instant, substance and nothingness were reversed, and thoughts and existence were exchanged. Mei Siren turned from a physical body into a thought and leaped toward the Taicheng Sword.</p><p>The two were about to come into contact…</p><p>Just as Mei Siren was about to blurt out the words ‘Heavenly Unravel’…</p><p>“Star studded, Spiritual Changing Sky!”</p><p>The truth and falsehood returned.</p><p>The concept died.</p><p>Mei Siren felt himself being pulled back into the deep abyss by the gravity.</p><p>With a bang, he was not injured this time with the protection of the sword image. It was just that he was mentally hurt…</p><p>It was too painful!</p><p>D*mn it, you Divine Sorcerer!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked down and smiled amidst the chaos.</p><p>“Not only this Three Streams of Red Plum Blossoms, I’ve also prepared for everything else.”</p><p>“The only thing that Master Siren can use to break out of this situation is the ‘Wisdom is Emptiness’. I will always stay vigilant and not let you touch or use the sword.”</p><p>After a pause, he warned.</p><p>“Although you can flatten the entire Qingyuan Mountain and the entire Thirty Three Heavens Star Weaving array, do note that everything inside will also disappear from this world.”</p><p>“I will leave first, but Cao Erzhu…”</p><p>He looked toward the other side.</p><p>Cao Erzhu no longer fought with himself.</p><p>He seemed to have fallen into a fantasy realm. He held a stone and spoke to the air.</p><p>“Dad, calm down first. I haven’t left Qingyuan Mountain yet. I didn’t run around randomly…”</p><p>“It’s all thanks to your timely appearance. Otherwise, I would have been killed by that strange uncle…”</p><p>“Oh, okay. I won’t address him as Uncle. Why did you hit me…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was amused.</p><p>The other fantasy realm might have triggered Cao Erzhu and broken through.</p><p>Kui Leihan was his absolute suppression. Even if he sensed that something was wrong, he did not dare to resist instinctively…</p><p>As for imitating Kui Leihan, Dao Qiongcang was very experienced at this.</p><p>He was so familiar with this person that he even knew that he had a mole on his thigh. He had even fought side by side with him for a while back then. How could the fantasy realm be revealed?</p><p>He still looked happy.</p><p>When he turned to look underground, Dao Qiongcang became serious again.</p><p>“When the Wisdom is Emptiness emerges, there’s no need to say more.”</p><p>“He will die.”</p><p>Mei Siren’s eyes twitched violently. He wanted to curse at this despicable and shameless person, but he remembered that this was the highest praise for a Divine Sorcerer.</p><p>“What exactly do you want?” He sighed.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang waved his hand, and two beams of starlight fell. One covered Cao Erzhu, and the other covered Mei Siren.</p><p>This was the Spiritual Protection Sky. It could prevent them from being hurt by the Spiritual Draw, but it could not do so outside of the starlight.</p><p>Therefore, this was actually not the Spiritual Protection Sky, but a prison.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang put his hands behind his back and walked in the air.</p><p>Qingyuan Mountain crumbled and re-formed into a strange shape. Behind him, a mountain dragon, a water elephant, a wood spirit, and a sand ghost evolved…</p><p>His gaze finally landed on the array wheel in Mei Siren’s hand and he slowly said.</p><p>“When a play ends, there must be a few members of the audience. I originally thought that perhaps the arrival of Bazhun’an would signify the greatest respect for my good show, but unfortunately, he did not turn up.”</p><p>“Of course, I respect you very much, Master Siren. Your arrival has brought light to Qingyuan Mountain. But you can just sit and watch the show. There’s no need to get involved. You’re not the main character.”</p><p>“I’m the main character?” Jin Ren could no longer remain silent.</p><p>When he felt the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale’s heartbeat speeding up in the Apricot Realm, his heartbeat accelerated too.</p><p>The Thirty Three Heavens Star Weaving array had been used by Dao Qiongcang to such a level. It was simply breathtaking.</p><p>And all of this was just to stop Cao Erzhu and Mei Siren from interfering.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s target had always been him!</p><p>“Yes, you are the main character.” Dao Qiongcang looked down as he sneered slightly.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, my protagonist, do you know what ‘despair’ means?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
