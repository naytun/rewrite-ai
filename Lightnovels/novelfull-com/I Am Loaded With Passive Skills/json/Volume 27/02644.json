Like the dragon sparrow in the human world, her blood relationship was rare.</p><p>It was different. Although it was also a Godhood plant, it was awakened by a great opportunity after bathing in the blood of the Dragon Ancestor.</p><p>One was a chicken that turned into a phoenix, while the other was born a natural phoenix.</p><p>Even though the two of them were at the same level and were highly similar, their essence was very different.</p><p>Not long ago, Dragon Apricot had also fantasized about the Nine Sacrificial Osmanthus…</p><p>However, even Eastern Mountain Sisal had despised its background and was ashamed to associate with it.</p><p>That fellow was also considered to have half an Acquired (Stage) level of attainment, and he was awakened by the fame of the Burial Sword Tomb. He was not much nobler than him.</p><p>Yet, it still dared to look down on him!</p><p>One could imagine how low Dragon Apricot’s status was in the chain of Ancestral Trees!</p><p>And now…</p><p>Dao Qiongcang actually suggested that it only needed to attend a banquet where the Nine Sacrificial Osmanthus would wait for it, and the bet would be canceled.</p><p>It did not even have to pay a single Dragon Apricot Seed to obtain such benefits. This sky-shattering wealth has finally fallen on my head?</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot stuttered, unable to speak.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s euphemism made it seem a little direct and crude. After hesitating for a long time, it asked in shock.</p><p>“She wants to undergo double cultivation with me?”</p><p>This Double Cultivation was not as it meant.</p><p>It was the fusion of fate and fortune, the convergence of the canopy, and from then on, they would be connected as one branch, share wealth, resist disasters, and join hands with billions of generations!</p><p>Uh, it was also…</p><p>At least, in Dragon Apricot’s understanding, they were no different from each other!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s mouth twitched when he heard that. After weighing his words, he said.</p><p>“There might be such intentions.”</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot was anxious!</p><p>What did it mean?</p><p>Why was there no definite answer given!</p><p>Soon, the Spirit of Dragon Apricot Tree woke up from its reverie. It looked at Dao Qiongcang, who was waiting respectfully for an answer, and a cold chill ran down its spine.</p><p>It thought again…</p><p>If it left, what would happen to Xu Xiaoshou? Would he be handed over to this person to be dealt with?</p><p>“I…”</p><p>“Senior Dragon Apricot, you just have to attend the banquet.”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>“You just have to attend the banquet.”</p><p>“Then Xu…”</p><p>“Every man for himself, let alone an Ancestral Tree? Senior Dragon Apricot, you (honorific form) just need to attend the banquet.”</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot wanted to speak three times.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang interrupted it three times.</p><p>For a time, the Apricot Realm fell into a deathly silence, and only the sound of boiling medicinal liquid could be heard.</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot was also boiling with emotions, unable to calm down.</p><p>It had more or less understood what this human kid was thinking.</p><p>That’s right, it was just attending a banquet. It did not have to think about anything else… It was fine!</p><p>Every tree had its most important moment in its life.</p><p>For this moment, some trees had waited for billions of years and died fruitlessly.</p><p>How could such an opportunity be blocked by someone who could disappear in a few thousand years?</p><p>The young talked about relationships, while the old valued benefits.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not bad, but he was not the most talented. Dragon Apricot had even accompanied him and witnessed his fall.</p><p>He was also not considered to have taken care of it. Why would an Ancestral Tree need humans to take care of it?</p><p>On the contrary, it had helped him with Dragon Apricot Seeds for a while, and he should be grateful!</p><p>As for the Holy Emperor’s dragon blood, it was only to satisfy his appetite. It was only something he obtained from trading and could not be considered a benefit.</p><p>Moving forward…</p><p>The reason why there was an Apricot Realm was because this Xu guy acted first and stole the entire Herb Garden of Divine Farmer!</p><p>Ultimately, the Apricot Realm and the Master of the Apricot Realm were just a win-win situation.</p><p>Now, there was a better opportunity and greater benefits in front of it. How could it miss the opportunity?</p><p>It was a double cultivation with the Nine Sacrificial Osmanthus that it had always dreamed of!</p><p>However, the Spirit of Dragon Apricot discovered that it could not immediately make the decision that should have been easy.</p><p>This seemed to have become another bigger gamble?</p><p>It was a gamble that was even more obscure than the previous one!</p><p>It was a bet between how his future would be more glorious if he cultivated with the Nine Sacrificial Osmanthus, or if Xu Xiaoshou would surpass the two Ancestral Trees in the future.</p><p>It seemed like…</p><p>This was not even a problem?</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot was silent for a long time. As if it had made a decision. It asked seriously.</p><p>“If I go to the Sacred Mountain and the Sacred Mountain imprisons me, what will happen?”</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s eyes lit up. He waved his hand and took out a black-red scroll.</p><p>Without hesitation, he tore off the precious Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree and swore under the witness of the Great Path and his own self.</p><p>“The Nine Sacrificial Osmanthus’ banquet will only be held for one night. If you miss this moment, there will be no other time…Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe has no ill intentions of imprisoning the Ancestral Tree Dragon Apricot. After a night, the Ancestral Tree Dragon Apricot could leave the Sacred Mountain and roam freely in the world…If we violate this oath, the heavens will punish us!”</p><p>Weng!</p><p>Taoist music played, signifying that the oath was verified by heaven.</p><p>This oath was detailed to the bone, and it included all possibilities. It was enough to make the tree feel completely at ease.</p><p>In the end, Dao Qiongcang advised solemnly.</p><p>“Senior Ancestral Tree, the banquet, and double cultivation are two separate events.”</p><p>“Even if both of you (honorific form) have the intention of double cultivation after this banquet, you (honorific form) must leave the Sacred Mountain immediately and not do anything rude!”</p><p>“Ancestral trees cultivating together is a serious matter. We should announce to the world to choose an auspicious day to welcome Dragon Apricot up the mountain. We must not take this lightly.”</p><p>“I hope that Senior is aware of this.”</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot immediately became anxious.</p><p>It could only stay at the Sacred Mountain for one night?</p><p>What did the double cultivation of Ancestral Trees have to do with you humans?</p><p>However, when it thought of Nine Sacrificial Osmanthus’s current identity as the Ninth Priest of the Holy Divine Palace, which had a far-reaching influence, the Spirit of Dragon Apricot nodded silently and tacitly agreed.</p><p>It was still a little conflicted. Finally, it glanced in the direction of the Crystal Palace and left a meaningful sentence.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou’s fortune is not over yet.”</p><p>How smart was Dao Qiongcang? He instantly got it and asked amusingly, “Do I look like a bloodthirsty person?”</p><p>“Then…”</p><p>Before the Spirit of Dragon Apricot could finish asking, Dao Qiongcang seemed to have a mind-reading ability.</p><p>“I am here for the Beast of Disaster!”</p><p>Beast of Disaster?</p><p>The Spirit of Dragon Apricot was stunned. Its saint’s will caught a glimpse of the little white cat who was secretly peeking at it while it was conducting alchemy. It nodded heavily.</p><p>Indeed.</p><p>This was the Beast of Disaster.</p><p>“Kind!”</p><p>The lingering sound of the voice reached this point, and the Spirit of Dragon Apricot disappeared.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang did not move. He took a deep breath and exhaled for a quarter of an hour.</p><p>During this process, he could no longer sense any activity from the Spirit of Dragon Apricot within the Apricot Realm.</p><p>Obviously, it left in a hurry.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang turned around and walked towards the Crystal Palace with a smile.</p><p>“Ta, ta, ta…”</p><p>Heavy footsteps echoed in the empty hall, and the pace of the footsteps gradually increased.</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit raised his front paw and looked at the uninvited guest. His white hair stood up and protected the alchemy cauldron.</p><p>Everything was ready.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was finally able to tear off his disguise. With a sinister smile, he rolled up his sleeves and drew his sword, stabbing it at the figure in the boiling alchemy cauldron.</p><p>“Xu the Beast, hand over your life!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
