He was not strong, but he was not weak either. He was at the right stage-he was just qualified to become a thorn in the side, a thorn in the flesh. Whoever touched him would be injured, and he would die if he were to touch him head-on!</p><p>He wasn’t stupid either. He wouldn’t let the tragedy of Bazhun’an and You Tu be repeated in the current era and set the world back 30 years!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The two swords slashed down from the dark green sky.</p><p>The sword image’s hoarse roar seemed to be perfectly aligned with its killing intent.</p><p>Before Dao Qiongcang was struck by the sword, he only that felt the sky and earth had collapsed.</p><p>Not only were the surrounding space and Path Principles shattered, but the heaven and earth element were also swept away by this sword.</p><p>The entire Qingyuan Mountain shook!</p><p>This was Qingyuan Mountain under the Thirty Three Heavens Star Weaving array. Every flower, stone, grass, and tree could become the great array’s Transformation or the array eye.</p><p>If they were all destroyed, it would mean that the array would be shattered by force.</p><p>And this seemed to have far exceeded Dao Qiongcang’s original intention to set up this array?</p><p>“Ancient swordsman, ancient sword saint…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang felt that he had underestimated the extreme pursuit of attack power by these lunatics.</p><p>In terms of combat power, the Heart Sword Technique wasn’t much stronger than the emotion sword technique that focused on one’s comprehension of the Dao.</p><p>Even Mei Siren was the same.</p><p>Undeniably, there was a boost from the Penetrating Divine Senses.</p><p>Then if he was an ancient swordsman who had attained sainthood with the Ten Thousand Sword Technique and the Mo Sword Technique as his main cultivation and with the addition of the Penetrating Divine Senses, how powerful would his combat strength be?</p><p>“Way of the Heavens!”</p><p>Without any hesitation, Dao Qiongcang activated the Qingyuan Mountain great array.</p><p>As soon as the order was issued, the night sky in the mountains suddenly lit up. The snowy leaves, sand, and stones were lifted up by the Sword Will and revealed the divine path pattern.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>There was a slight tremor.</p><p>Everything on Qingyuan Mountain, including all the living beings in the world spat out dewy pearls that turned into a layer of clear light. This covered the Nine Heavens.</p><p>This layer of membrane was supported by the Qingyuan Mountain great array and driven by the Way of the Heavens. It borrowed the Force of Rules and was as light as mist, but it could bear great weight.</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>The green double sword image slashed at the barrier of the Way of the Heavens. The mist that was filled with spiritual strength immediately exploded, and the sound resounded for thousands of miles.</p><p>Cao Erzhu looked up and his eyes shone like stars.</p><p>He saw a layer of green airflow spread out in the sky. It was beautiful and powerful.</p><p>“This is the Spiritual Cultivation world…”</p><p>Cao Erzhu was fascinated and his blood started to boil.</p><p>No matter how flowery the words in the storybooks were, it was difficult to describe one billionth of what he now witnessed with his own eyes.</p><p>The tingling sensation was an extreme emotional experience that could not be described verbally.</p><p>“Ka!”</p><p>In his field of vision, the sky was like a mirror as it was shattered by the peerless dual swords.</p><p>Cao Erzhu felt as if his world had shattered and died. His entire body trembled and his pores were wide open. His hair stood on end.</p><p>“Buzz…”</p><p>Purple-blue electric currents surrounded his body.</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s gaze was filled with extreme desire.</p><p>This was the real world!</p><p>This was what a man pursued!</p><p>For the past 26 years, Cao Erzhu’s life only consisted of slaughtering pigs, forging knives, cooking, and buying vegetables…</p><p>Apart from some minor cultivation and the Spiritual Cultivation world.</p><p>He had cultivated a number of skills, but his father had confined him in that small and dilapidated blacksmith shop. He could not make use of the skills.</p><p>He was like a rubber ball with the best elasticity in the world, pressed down to the ground, pressed to the point where he was about to be destroyed and deformed, which was also the state before he could bounce back… Suddenly, the hand that had held him down for twenty-six years disappeared!</p><p>“Ha…”</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s eyes widened, and a low guttural sound came from his throat, like a beast’s low growl.</p><p>His back was bent, his hands hung at his side, but his head was raised to the highest point, his eyes were wide open, and his fists were clenched tightly.</p><p>He did not know what kind of state he was in right now because he had never experienced it before.</p><p>He couldn’t describe how he seemed to have lost control, but he still enjoyed this current manic mood he was in.</p><p>No!</p><p>Cao Erzhu actually knew…</p><p>He wanted to become that powerful old immortal Mei!</p><p>He wanted to become that strange uncle!</p><p>He even wanted to become the most dazzling ‘big bang’ in the night sky!</p><p>“Hehehe…”</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s entire body trembled violently. Purple lightning flashed and his eyes were bloodshot as he roared aloud.</p><p>However, his father didn’t teach him how to ‘become’, so he didn’t dare to ‘become’ so casually.</p><p>Dreams and the unknown.</p><p>Desire and rationality.</p><p>There seemed to be an intangible threshold between the two.</p><p>Cao Erzhu couldn’t take a step forward and didn’t know whether he should lift his foot or not.</p><p>At this moment, a calm voice sounded in his ears.</p><p>“If you can’t bear it, you can shout aloud.”</p><p>“You’re actually not that important, and no one has the time to keep an eye on you all the time.”</p><p>Cao Erzhu felt like he heard the devil’s whisper in his mind.</p><p>However, what it said made sense. It simply spoke to his heart.</p><p>At this time, a huge battle loomed over them and there was no one around, even if he shouted, who would pay attention? Who would care?</p><p>Even if my father was resurrected and I screamed in excitement, so what? Can I be beaten up?</p><p>With this thought in mind, Cao Erzhu waved his arm and bent his body. He lowered his head and called out softly,</p><p>“Hah!”</p><p>With a bang, the trees in the nearby forest that had been blown away by the aftershock of the Nine Heavens chaotic battle toppled and it was even louder than his cry.</p><p>“Are you a sissy?!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
