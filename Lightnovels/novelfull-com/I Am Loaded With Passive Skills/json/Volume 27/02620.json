Without exception, they all exploded under the assault of the God Punishment Tribulation. They offered no protection at all.</p><p>Apart from that, Dao Qiongcang had mastered the Divine Thirty-Six Form that was impossible to defend against and was extremely strange. The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was blown up by it during their first encounter.</p><p>However, under Cao Erzhu’s attack, Dao Qiongcang’s battle consciousness seemed unable to keep up. He was simply like a human pillar that awaited his slaughter.</p><p>Was it because of Dao Qiongcang’s poor skills?</p><p>That was definitely not the case!</p><p>There was a huge problem with Cao Erzhu’s God Punishment Tribulation!</p><p>There had to be some reason that even Jin Ren couldn’t see, that caused Dao Qiongcang to fail to react to Cao Erzhu’s sneak attack and ended up with his head being blown off.</p><p>“Also, his last move when he reeled in the person in the end; there was a hint of the Puppet Manipulation Thread Weaving Technique. He must have done an in-depth study of the acupuncture points, the structure, and even the ‘diagrams’ of the human body!”</p><p>“The Thirty Three Heavens Star Weaving array did not provide timely protection for Elder Dao the Flamboyant. Could it be that Little Yu failed to set up a passive counterattack function?”</p><p>“She might not have set it up, but would someone like Elder Dao not be on his guard after he took over the great array?”</p><p>Jin Ren was skeptical about this.</p><p>He could see much more details than Yu Zhiwen, Mei Siren and the others!</p><p>He himself was an all-rounder, so he knew that the few moves that Cao Erzhu had revealed in the battle just now contained a lot of hard work and sweat.</p><p>To sum it up in one phrase : it made light of a heavy task!</p><p>All of this wasn’t just presented in the form of Spiritual Cultivation. It was the Penetrating Divine Senses that was even more difficult to cultivate, and even more difficult to control.</p><p>As long as an outsider managed to cultivate the Penetrating Divine Senses, it would be a qualitative transformation.</p><p>This fellow used the God Punishment Tribulation as an ordinary attack and performed a Transformation to it. His attack method might have also involved ancient martial arts, the Divine Secret and the Way of Spirit Array…</p><p>As he thought of this, Jin Ren’s consciousness shook and he recalled what Bazhun’an said after he awakened when he received the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy on Abyss Island.</p><p>“A peerless genius!”</p><p>The words spoken at that time overlapped with the present images.</p><p>The connection between his self illusion and the real world.</p><p>When he used his spiritual senses and saw how Cao Erzhu stared blankly at the head of the array wheel as he waited for him to speak, Jin Ren realized something…</p><p>Perhaps, the perfect image of a graceful, dignified person who rode the lightning and wind in his mind, was non-existent in the first place.</p><p>The peerless genius that Bazhun’an spoke about, who had to be invited out of seclusion, was none other than the blockhead in front of him, Cao Erzhu!</p><p>At this moment, Jin Ren’s thoughts became active.</p><p>He was one of ten thousand people who did not believe that Kui Leihan had really been killed.</p><p>Even if Kui Leihan’s head was placed in front of him, he would still think that this was a trick, one of Elder Dao the Flamboyant’s cunning tricks.</p><p>However, when he looked at the extremely cute Erzhu in front of him, who scratched his head with such an innocent look…</p><p>Jin Ren thought that Kui Leihan deserved to die!</p><p>He really deserved to die! He had to die! Even if he was not dead, at this moment, Kui Leihan had to die!</p><p>“Master Siren, please hand me over to Zhu Bao… Uh, Cao Erzhu; Jin Ren’s voice sounded low and magnetic.</p><p>Mei Siren frowned. He felt that something was amiss but could not put his finger on it.</p><p>He did as he was told.</p><p>Cao Erzhu dazedly held the head of the array wheel and felt rather uneasy. This reminded him of his father’s head in the wine barrel.</p><p>At this moment, Jin Ren spoke.</p><p>His voice was filled with sorrow, serious intent and determination.</p><p>“Erzhu, do you know?”</p><p>“Some people are alive, but they are already dead. Some people are dead, but they are still alive…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
