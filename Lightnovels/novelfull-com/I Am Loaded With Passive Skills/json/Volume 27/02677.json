It was unknown if she was frightened by the words “Divine Puppet” or by the explosion beside her.</p><p>Her legs gave way and she collapsed to the ground.</p><p>“This is only a preliminary appraisal!” Seeing this, Xi hurriedly added,</p><p>“There are no other Divine Sorcerers on the Sacred Mountain…”</p><p>“Uh, no, there are no high-level Divine Sorcerers!”</p><p>“Therefore, we’re looking for someone to maintain the Sacred Mountain’s array…This is a maintenance master…appraisal…”</p><p>Under the murderous gaze of Hallmaster Xuanji, Xi’s voice grew softer and softer.</p><p>“I’m just as scared alright!” Xi roared crazily in his heart.</p><p>After ascending to the Sacred Mountain and learning of this information, Xi’s reaction was almost identical to Jiang Nayi’s. He was so frightened that he collapsed at the Transformation Division.</p><p>Let’s not talk about the others for the time being…</p><p>All members of the Path Division had died!</p><p>All of them were suspected to be Divine Puppets!</p><p>At that time, Xi felt that this information was too ridiculous, so he simply submitted it first and didn’t want to think too much.</p><p>Looking at Hallmaster Xuanji’s reaction, coupled with his previous speculations, it’s likely that the one who was being ridiculous was himself.</p><p>He’s so weak that he couldn’t comprehend Hallmaster Dao’s level!</p><p>Xi was on the verge of collapse, however, he had to acknowledge the fact that…</p><p>This meant all the people he had come into contact with in the past, who he thought were filled with blood, flesh, and emotions. Some even had families and children…</p><p>All of them could be fake!</p><p>This could all be done by Hallmaster Dao, or rather, it could very well be done by him!</p><p>This included the annual “Divine Tournament” and “Heaven Ranking Selection” held by the Path Division, as well as the “Divine Secret Basic Training” held from time to time with the other five divisions and the guardians of the Sacred Mountain…</p><p>Were those all an illusion?</p><p>Was it all an act done by Hallmaster Dao to entertain himself?</p><p>Oh, no!</p><p>There was also Yu Zhiwen…</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>At this point, Xi’s face suddenly turned pale.</p><p>He couldn’t imagine that even Yu Zhiwen was a Divine Puppet!</p><p>One day, this Path Division Chief suddenly returned with a purple bra that was three fingers thick. He stared at her beautiful starry eyes and said with a faint smile, “Divine secrets must not be revealed.”</p><p>When this scene appeared in his mind, Xi felt terrible. It was worse than swallowing a fly.</p><p>At the same time, Hallmaster Xuanji’s eyes returned to normal and she asked in a deep voice,</p><p>“Where’s Little Yu?”</p><p>“Is she really a Divine Puppet?” Xi was shocked.</p><p>“I’m asking where she is. Is she also in the Path Division? Is she dead too?” Dao Xuanji’s tone was cold.</p><p>“Oh, no!” Only then did Xi recover and realize that he had been overly cautious, “When I returned to the Sacred Mountain, she was still on a mission at Qingyuan Mountain. She shouldn’t be in danger. After all, she has the protection of Hallmaster Dao…Eh?”</p><p>The surroundings suddenly fell silent.</p><p>The situation turned extremely awkward.</p><p>Xi ultimately couldn’t come to terms with the fact that Hallmaster Dao had betrayed the Sacred Mountain.</p><p>When Xi realized that Hallmaster Dao, who had been his strong support in the past—regardless of any mishaps, always revealed a knowing smile when he looked back—had deliberately allowed himself to be sold to the enemy.</p><p>Now that he had become an enemy that he had to guard against, Xi felt an indescribable discomfort.</p><p>And fear!</p><p>How was this even possible?</p><p>Hallmaster Dao had just left, and he had already brought out such a great terror. Would there still be peaceful days in Sacred Mountain Guizhe?</p><p>“Call her back.”</p><p>Dao Xuanji waved her horsetail whisk and returned to her calm state as she sat down.</p><p>“Caw,”</p><p>She staggered.</p><p>She almost stepped on the shattered golden dragon throne and slipped.</p><p>Fortunately, her battle awareness and reaction time were not bad. Dao Xuanji only tilted her body and stood up straight again.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>Xi and Jiang Nayi both sucked in a breath of cold air.</p><p>She was obviously not calm at all!</p><p>The two of them had a strange tacit understanding. The thought of helping her out didn’t even cross their mind as they plan to pretend that they didn’t see anything just now.</p><p>“The seats have been changed.” Dao Xuanji turned around and looked calmly at the dragon throne fragment beneath her. “The color doesn’t match.”</p><p>The noble and imposing golden color was, of course, extremely incompatible with the pure silver and elegant environment of Saint Hall.</p><p>“However, wasn’t it also you who proposed the requirement for ‘uniqueness’?”</p><p>Jiang Nayi cursed silently, but she did not dare to take out Dao Qiongcang’s silver chair. She only got up and asked,</p><p>“Should we change it to silver?”</p><p>Dao Xuanji nodded, her eyes empty.</p><p>Soon, her eyes were focused. She pointed at the tables, chairs, and pillars in front of her. “Change them all. Change them to black.”</p><p>“Understood!” Jiang Nayi bowed and lowered her head, not daring to say another word.</p><p>The hall returned to silence.</p><p>With a forehead full of sweat, Xi busily performed dozens of repeated hand seals before he summoned an ordinary little ghost that left the Saint Hall.</p><p>“I’ve already sent someone to summon Yu Zhiwen.”</p><p>“Alright, then you may leave.”</p><p>“I want to retreat too!” Xi thought quietly,</p><p>“Your occasional loss of control is too oppressive!”</p><p>“Why don’t you stay calm like Hallmaster Dao, or explode on the spot and vent your anger?”</p><p>Xi steeled himself and took out another jade scroll. He placed it on his forehead and took it down.</p><p>“This is a message we just received. The aura of a ghost beast has appeared at the southern gate of the Jade Capital City. Elder Fang is requesting backup.”</p><p>“Do you want to see the details?”</p><p>Dao Xuanji didn’t take the jade scroll. She said in an unfriendly tone, “Didn’t Elder Zhong and Elder Yu already send backup to him? Why can’t three Saints take down a ghost beast?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
