You can go to the Dead Sea by yourself.”</p><p>“Today, I can pretend that I didn’t see anything. My companion didn’t die in your hands.”</p><p>“I won’t report this matter after we return to the Stairway to Heaven. After you’ve received your thirty-six punishments, you can leave the Dead Sea and return to the Sacred Mountain. How about it?”</p><p>The response was still a deathly silence.</p><p>The Gold Robe man seemed to hear a low laugh amid his daze. His eyes were bloodshot and he nearly went berserk as he ranted in anger.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang!”</p><p>“You sinner, if you want to kill me or cut me up, just do it.”</p><p>“I’m the judge who wields the Sword of Justice. Why would I be afraid of you?”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the Gold Robe man suddenly discovered something.</p><p>His right hand grabbed the Sword of Justice, and his left hand reached into his mouth.</p><p>“Dao Xiong Hang…”</p><p>The Gold Robe man was baffled.</p><p>Because his left hand reached in and pulled his tongue all the way out of his mouth.</p><p>It was already very uncomfortable for him to perform this action as he knelt on the ground.</p><p>But even so, his right hand did not stop for a moment. Against his will, he held the sword against his extended tongue.</p><p>“Dao Xiong Hang?”</p><p>“Dao Xiong Hang!”</p><p>“No… No… Dao Xiong Hang! Dao… Ah!”</p><p>The golden Sword of Justice slashed, and blood splattered everywhere. The Gold Robe man had cut his own tongue.</p><p>“Ahhhhh…”</p><p>He was in so much pain that he wanted to die. He rolled around on the ground and realized at this moment that he was able to move.</p><p>His face was covered in blood, and tears and snot flowed freely from his nose. However, he hurriedly retreated and grabbed his sword to protect himself.</p><p>When he realized that there was a bloody tongue in his left hand, he screamed in fear and disgust and hurriedly flung it away.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, are you courting death?!”</p><p>This clear piercing voice even scared the Gold Robe man himself.</p><p>His tongue had regrown?</p><p>He looked at Dao Qiongcang, who was dressed in a long loose robe and realized that when he moved his fingers, his body seemed to be imbued with endless Life force.</p><p>Great Protection Spell?</p><p>“You, what’s on your mind?”</p><p>The Gold Robe man was stunned until he realized that his left hand had sneaked into his mouth and once again pulled out his tongue. His right hand held the Sword of Justice…</p><p>“No!”</p><p>At this moment, the Gold Robe man was terrified and he cried bitterly.</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>He cut off his tongue again.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang! You deserve to die! You must die!”</p><p>His tongue had regrown again?</p><p>Before the Gold Robe man could react, his left hand raked violently across his face, knocked out his teeth, and pulled out his tongue.</p><p>The sword in his right hand slashed down with all his might.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang!”</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, Dao Qiongcang, don’t…”</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>“I’m sorry, Hallmaster Dao…”</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao, let me go!”</p><p>After he called out ‘Hallmaster Dao’, he saw hundreds of bloody tongues piled up in front of him. The Gold Robe man then realized that his hands had stopped moving.</p><p>There was a large hole where the lower half of his face was and all his teeth had been punched out and embedded into his bones. Only his tongue was intact.</p><p>He fell weakly to the ground and finally felt liberated. He suppressed the hatred in his eyes and said humbly.</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao, I was wrong.”</p><p>“You are a magnanimous man. Please let me go!”</p><p>“I have never seen or experienced anything like what happened today. I swear that I will never betray you!”</p><p>There were no other sounds, only the Gold Robe man’s heavy breathing.</p><p>He quietly knelt on the ground and waited in panic. He waited for the pool of blood under him to slowly transport his fleshy tongue to the Dead Sea.</p><p>Just when he thought that everything had come to an end and that there was no chance of a turnaround, a voice devoid of any emotion came from the front.</p><p>“I didn’t hear any reverence in your tone.”</p><p>The Gold Robe man was stunned.</p><p>This sentence sounded a little familiar?</p><p>In the next moment, he jumped up and smashed his left hand into his skull again. He pulled out his tongue and raised the sword in his right hand to slash it.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao, let me go, let me go…”</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao!”</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>“I’m sorry, Hallmaster Dao. I shouldn’t have said those words before. I’m not human. I’m guilty…”</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>“I was wrong! I was wrong! I’m worse than a pig or a dog. I’m worse than a cow or a horse. Please let me off this time. I promise that I will never do it again…”</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang! I will not forgive you even if I become a ghost…”</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>“Ahaha, hahaha, I can’t be a ghost, right! That’s right! Haha… No, don’t! I’m sorry, I’m sorry. No, no, no…”</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang, with his flowing hair and loose robe, walked into the Dead Sea and did not display any emotions.</p><p>In the tunnel behind him, in the Divine World that had opened up, there was only the Gold Robe man left.</p><p>He knelt down on the ‘sin’ edict, grabbed the seal and cut his tongue with his sword.</p><p>Sometimes he repented, sometimes he went crazy, sometimes he cursed, and sometimes he apologized…</p><p>This Divine World was independent of the outside world. Unless the Divine Sorcerer who cast the spell died, it would not disappear.</p><p>If it didn’t disappear, the situation inside would not be known to outsiders.</p><p>Of course, there was also a possibility that Dao Xuanji would personally come to the Dead Sea and use the Divine Secret to search for traces. This was the only way it could be discovered.</p><p>However, Dao Qiongcang had only visited the Dead Sea twice in his 30 years of reign, let alone the high and mighty Hallmaster Xuanji?</p><p>The first time, Dao Qiongcang had come to the Dead Sea not long ago was to persuade Gou Wuyue and give him the semi-saint person, but he had failed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
