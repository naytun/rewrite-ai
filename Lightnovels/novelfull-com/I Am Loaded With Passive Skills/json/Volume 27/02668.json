He stepped on the black water and pointed at a grayish-white Godhood-Sealing Coffin in front of him and the sealed corpse within.</p><p>“The ancient swordsman has sharp eyes.” Dao Qiongcang hurriedly dodged but his mouth never stopped. “Unfortunately, he has no sword cognition…”</p><p>Gou Wuyue felt dizzy.</p><p>He already regretted having followed him out.</p><p>This journey was truly too annoying!</p><p>“How do you know that Wei Feng is in there?” Gou Wuyue pointed at the ‘corpse’.</p><p>“Of course, I was the one who left him there.” Dao Qiongcang glanced at him strangely.</p><p>“Both of them have failed their missions. If we send them back to the Sacred Mountain, won’t those idiots cut off their arms again?”</p><p>“Beibei is fine…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang stepped on the Godhood-Sealing Coffin and looked at Wei Feng.</p><p>“He’s like you. Maybe he’s even worse off than you.”</p><p>“I reckon that he would not have to leave the Dead Sea for the rest of his life. I won’t be able to plead for mercy!”</p><p>Gou Wuyue was stunned.</p><p>Only then did he remember that the God of Killing Wei Feng had killed to prove his Dao. Blood flowed like a river and he had been taken to the Dead Sea by the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>Later, it was only when Dao Qiongcang gave the order for him to leave that Wei Feng was entrusted with the important tasks and became the sharpest blade of the Sacred Mountain.</p><p>Now it seemed like…</p><p>“You kept this blade for yourself?” Gou Wuyue didn’t know what to think. A woman’s heart was like a needle at the bottom of the sea. Dao Qiongcang’s heart was deeper than the bottom of the sea.</p><p>“What else?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang laughed.</p><p>He was the one who issued the invitation.</p><p>The situation was under his control.</p><p>If he had not spoken up, Wei Feng would have remained in the Dead Sea for the rest of his life.</p><p>From the moment he left and was conferred the title of the Third Emperor, he was destined to be loyal to him only and not the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>In the past, the name Dao Qiongcang was synonymous with the Holy Divine Palace, and the two were equivalent to one.</p><p>Now that they were about to split up, the assets naturally had to be divided as well.</p><p>All for his sister?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was not a good person.</p><p>He didn’t want anything else but a sword and a blade. They were all abandoned. This wasn’t too much, right?</p><p>“Leave the coffin here. Beibei is inside.”</p><p>“When our Hallmaster Xuanji senses that something is wrong later, she will come and look for her.”</p><p>“Oh, let her have a taste of being nurtured for thirty years. I just hope that her sword doesn’t shatter in the end.”</p><p>“As for Wei Feng…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang waved his hand and said casually.</p><p>“Wake him up and ask him.”</p><p>“If he’s willing, then let’s leave. If not, he can return to the Sacred Mountain.”</p><p>“I didn’t plan to persuade you to quit because I didn’t feel the need to.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang smiled as he finished speaking. After he waited for a while, Gou Wuyue didn’t move, so he looked over.</p><p>Gou Wuyue turned to stare at him.</p><p>The two of them looked at each other for a long time and the void was filled with an electrifying discharge.</p><p>“Call him! Dao Qiongcang gestured with his chin.</p><p>“Me?” Gou Wuyue pointed at himself.</p><p>“Who else is here?”</p><p>“What…” After Gou Wuyue looked around, he was amused. “What capacity do you have that you can start ordering me around now?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was stunned.</p><p>“You are Hallmaster Dao?” Gou Wuyue asked.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>“I’m the Ruler of the white-clothed people?”</p><p>“No…”</p><p>“You’re one generation ahead of me?”</p><p>“That’s not the case…”</p><p>“You’ve beaten me?”</p><p>“That’s because we haven’t fought before…”</p><p>“Then let’s fight?”</p><p>“There’s no need for that…”</p><p>“Then you issued an order to me?”</p><p>“Haha.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang smiled helplessly. He could only bend down and slap Wei Feng, who was right in front of him, as if he had been defeated.</p><p>Very soon, he raised his eyes again. His gaze lingered between Wei Feng who was gradually waking up and Gou Wuyue. He said faintly, “Now do you know why we need the triangular force?”</p><p>Gou Wuyue couldn’t be bothered with him.</p><p>After Wei Feng slowly woke up, the first thing he saw was Dao Qiongcang and Gou Wuyue. He almost thought he was hallucinating.</p><p>“Senior Wei Feng…”</p><p>Gou Wuyue greeted him first.</p><p>This was no longer due to the difference in position and strength, but purely out of respect for a senior.</p><p>Wei Feng nodded in response, but before he could say anything, his eyes suddenly changed and was filled with murderous intent.</p><p>With a flip of his hand, he recalled one of the top ten Great Psionic Weapons, Yama’s Banquet, from somewhere, and ruthlessly hacked at Gou Wuyue’s head.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Gou Wuyue felt a chill run down his spine. As he retreated, a green Mo Sword appeared.</p><p>At the same time, the famed sword The Voice of Nulan, was unsheathed and placed in front of him.</p><p>The Green River Sword Boardline formed in all directions at the same moment. It was about to converge into a sword flow and slash at Yama’s Banquet and even the God of Killing, Wei Feng.</p><p>“Whoa…”</p><p>The air current poured down and Gou Wuyue’s clothes fluttered wildly.</p><p>However, the Yama’s Banquet came to a stop in front of The Voice of Nulan in a timely manner and did not clash.</p><p>Gou Wuyue’s eyes were filled with suspicion, and he hurriedly suppressed his movements. The Green River Sword Boardline also stopped in its tracks.</p><p>“Eh?” Wei Feng was bewildered. After he hurriedly put away his saber, he looked at his hand that held the saber in a strange manner as if he wondered why he had lost control.</p><p>“Senior Wei Feng, what are you doing?” Gou Wuyue broke out in cold sweat.</p><p>“I…” Wei Feng was stunned for a moment. He was still confused as to why he had suddenly attacked just now. “I’m sorry. Perhaps it was a stress reaction…”</p><p>Stress?</p><p>I didn’t even draw my sword.</p><p>There wasn’t even the slightest hint of hostility. Why were you so worked up?</p><p>Gou Wuyue didn’t dare to put away his sword; he was afraid that the God of Killing Wei Feng would go crazy again.</p><p>At this moment, he caught a glimpse of Dao Qiongcang’s faint smile.</p><p>“You did that?”</p><p>No matter when, if something strange took place, it was definitely not wrong to blame it on Elder Dao the Flamboyant!</p><p>Unexpectedly, Dao Qiongcang did not refute. He smiled and clapped his hands, and the starlight on his fingertips dissipated.</p><p>On Wei Feng’s back, there was also tiny strands of imperceptible spirit threads that broke.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
