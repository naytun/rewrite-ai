How were they going to defeat the remaining one who had appeared on the other side?</p><p>Give it to the Five Decays of Heaven and Man?</p><p>He had already gone into hiding…</p><p>No!</p><p>He was well hidden!</p><p>This guy shouldn’t even be here.</p><p>If he stayed here, it was possible that the Holy Divine Palace would get five more semi-saint persons tomorrow.</p><p>“Swoosh…”</p><p>” Swish… swish… swish…”</p><p>Just as the second true body called out frantically to the main body, the huge commotion outside Jade Capital City seemed to have disturbed the cultivators who were in seclusion nearby.</p><p>After they arrived, many of the figures retreated, stopped, or pulled away as they chose to watch from the side.</p><p>A flaw seemed to have appeared in Jade Capital City’s great array?</p><p>No matter how loud the commotion in the outside world was, it would not have alarmed the people in the city. Now, it seemed everyone heard the angry roars of the ghost beast that sounded like thunder.</p><p>The bold and curious ones quietly approached, while the timid and fearful ones stayed well behind.</p><p>The wind blew across and the cold sweet scent of the osmanthus flowers made the people feel anxious and panicky.</p><p>“Guys, why aren’t you retreating?”</p><p>Fang Wenxin waited for some time at the Southern Zone gate. This had already attracted the attention of outsiders. The people who surrounded the ghost beast had no intention to leave.</p><p>He seemed to have understood something and frowned slightly.</p><p>Elder Yu rubbed his presbyopic eyes, craned his neck to size up the people opposite him. He then pointed at them one by one and said.</p><p>“Mei Siren, sword saint. His main cultivation is the Heart Sword Technique. You haven’t met him before, right? Do you see that sword? The one that cut the God Worship Willow Tree that day… Yes, yes, it’s You Tu’s, the Taicheng Sword!”</p><p>“Ye Xiaotian, this is a child of the Holy Palace. He must have snuck out. The Holy Palace isn’t that irrational… Upanishad demi-saint… Yes, you didn’t hear wrongly. He has the Spatial Upanishad. This talent is much stronger than the two of you!”</p><p>“And this brat…”</p><p>Elder Yu’s eyes suddenly widened as he pointed at the young man. His tone became a little excited. “This kid, I’m definitely not mistaken. He’s Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?” Fang Wenxin glanced at him with a frown.</p><p>“No way, Brother Fang. You haven’t even heard of Lord Shou. You’re too backward. You can’t keep up with the pace of young people at all!”</p><p>“He doesn’t look like a demi-saint?”</p><p>“Not a demi-saint, but better than a demi-saint!” Elder Yu’s ears were almost covered with calluses after he heard this name so many times recently. The main reason was that he had been on his guard recently and took the initiative to get more information. “Little Dao even mentioned to me… Him! The Ten High Nobles.”</p><p>The elders of that era seemed to have an extremely clear concept of the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>Fang Wenxin’s expression changed immediately after he heard that. It was as if he faced an opponent of the same level; he faced a junior, as if he faced a great enemy!</p><p>“The rest is up to you. Help me capture that Xu kid. Don’t kill him. Leave him to me.” Elder Yu rubbed his hands as his eyes filled with excitement.</p><p>“Do you have a grudge against him?” Fang Wenxin did not even turn back. He didn’t dare to be distracted. “You want to feed him to the fish?”</p><p>“What fish!” He seemed to have stepped on Elder Yu’s sensitive nerve as he stomped his feet. “Shut up if you don’t know how to talk! Just take him down and leave him to me. Don’t be such a busybody!”</p><p>Fang Wenxin finally understood.</p><p>The ghost beast had been brought by these few people.</p><p>There was no need to talk much about their standpoint. They were definitely enemies of the red-clothed people.</p><p>His eyes were still half-closed and the killing intent in his eyes could no longer be suppressed. However, at this moment, Dao Xuanji’s mission leaped into his mind…</p><p>A new official would do stuff to show his ability and courage. Even Fang Wenxin didn’t want to become the fuel for that.</p><p>“Everyone.”</p><p>As soon as these two words came out.</p><p>With a buzz, sand and snow flew up at the Southern Zone gate.</p><p>Everyone’s vision blurred, and they felt as if they were in another world. There were shadows of bloody ghost eyes that stared at them from afar, and illusions of ghost beasts were formed out of thin air around them.</p><p>The holy realm?</p><p>The second true body reacted. Fang Wenxin had locked onto everyone present, and he had no intention of letting go.</p><p>“There is no need to leave. I only have one question to ask you…”</p><p>Fang Wenxin’s eyes swept over the trio in the distance.</p><p>“Who is the main culprit?”</p><p>Dao Xuanji said that the appearance of this ghost beast might indicate a problem within, but these three people were not from the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>So, they colluded with someone on the Sacred Mountain?</p><p>Ye Xiaotian remained silent.</p><p>Mei Siren also looked at the young man at the front.</p><p>Fang Wenxin could tell from this small action that this kid was not simple. Elder Yu was not lying.</p><p>Otherwise, why would the two demi-saints give up the right to speak to a young man?</p><p>The young man named Xu Xiaoshou did not disappoint and stood up. He stood tall and proud amid the biting wind and snow and the dense ghostly energy.</p><p>Suddenly, the scene changed. His mouth twitched and tears flowed out of his eyes. He pointed at the ghost beast Greedy the Cat Spirit with a sorrowful expression.</p><p>“Old Senior Fang, please help me!”</p><p>“This, this, this is the work of that d*mned Dao Qiongcang. He turned the Greedy the Cat Spirit into this. He’s a pervert!”</p><p>“The head of the Holy Divine Palace colluded with a ghost beast. He knowingly violated the law. This is a capital offense!”</p><p>After he finished speaking, the kid looked around. He stepped on a Power Upanishad Formation that attracted the attention of all the spectators from afar.</p><p>He shouted at everyone from all directions.</p><p>“Death penalty!”</p><p>Before the countless confused spectators could react in panic, they were asked to leave the battlefield and return to their original positions.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
