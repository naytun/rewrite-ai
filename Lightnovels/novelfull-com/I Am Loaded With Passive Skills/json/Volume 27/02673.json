Hallmaster Xuanji did not respond.</p><p>“Why did you not interrogate that Ten High Nobles Xiang Yaoyao? He asked in a sarcastic manner.</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao would not allow it.” Xi held back and replied calmly.</p><p>“Haha, what a joke! Hallmaster Dao wouldn’t allow it? Is Hallmaster Dao still around now? Right now, there’s only one Hallmaster Xuanji on the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.” Jiang Nayi scoffed. “I think you’re the one who dared not carry out the interrogation…”</p><p>At this point, Jiang Nayi seemed to recall something and he rolled his eyes.</p><p>“If your Transformation Division does not dare to do the interrogation, then leave it to me.”</p><p>“I, Jiang Nayi, am not afraid of the Ten High Nobles. As long as Xiang Yaoyao is in my hands, I guarantee that…”</p><p>A cold voice suddenly rang out in the Saint Hall.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Jiang Nayi felt as if he had been struck by lightning. He turned around met Hallmaster Xuanji’s murderous gaze. He fell to his knees and hit the ground with a thud.</p><p>“I was wrong, I was wrong…”</p><p>“This is my first order after taking office. No one in the Sacred Mountain is allowed to harm Xiang Yaoyao in any way. Anyone who violates this order will be beheaded instantly.” Dao Xuanji said coldly.</p><p>“Yes, sir!”</p><p>Xi nodded intently.</p><p>As expected of a family. Her order was identical to her brother’s orders.</p><p>“Get up.”</p><p>Jiang Nayi only dared to stand up after he felt that he had been pardoned.</p><p>“Continue.”</p><p>Dao Xuanji waved the horsetail whisk in her hand. Xi hesitated for a moment before he continued.</p><p>“There are three more things and it concerns the Sacred Mountain.”</p><p>“First, the three judges from the Judicial Division went missing after Dao… the previous Hallmaster entered the Dead Sea.”</p><p>“Ah?” Jiang Nayi was startled and turned to look at Hallmaster Xuanji. His fingers trembled. “He, he, he ran away?”</p><p>“We conducted a search in the Dead Sea. We haven’t found Hallmaster Dao.” Xi added.</p><p>“He dared to run away? Jiang Nayi’s face turned pale and he was so panicky that he did not take in what was being said at all. He looked around and it seemed that he was surrounded by Dao Qiongcang. “He wouldn’t dare! He definitely wouldn’t dare! How could he dare to kill the judges from the Judicial Division? And even disobey orders and run?</p><p>“He should die!”</p><p>“We haven’t confirmed whether Hallmaster Dao was the one who killed the judges; neither did we confirm that Hallmaster Dao is missing. We have to search the Dead Sea before we can…”</p><p>“Shut up!” Jiang Nayi pointed at the guy at the entrance of the hall and shouted. When he thought of his plan to get rid of Hallmaster Dao, what would happen if he really went off, but later came back…</p><p>Jiang Nayi felt like he was about to die!</p><p>Perhaps he would meet with an accidental death in the future.</p><p>However, at this moment, he saw the figure at the entrance of the hall fly in front of him with a whoosh.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Within the span of two explosions, Jiang Nayi’s leg bones were shattered.</p><p>When he looked up in shock, he saw that Xi’s sword fingers were aimed at his glabella.</p><p>His gaze was extremely cold.</p><p>“Breaking into the Saint Hall, crime number one.”</p><p>“An outsider who stayed in the Sacred Mountain without our knowledge, crime number two.”</p><p>“Repeatedly being disrespectful toward the Chief of the six divisions. That’s the third crime!”</p><p>Xi announced all these coldly as if he was looking at a condemned person. “I can kill you for these three crimes and will report you to Hallmaster Xuanji!”</p><p>“You, you, you…” At this moment, Jiang Nayi felt that as if his life was about to end.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>However, at this moment, the map of the divine secret appeared under Xi’s feet and he was teleported to the entrance of the hall.</p><p>Celestial Scroll?</p><p>Dao Xuanji knew this too?</p><p>Xi was stunned for a moment before he silently lowered his finger. He knew that this person was under Hallmaster Xuanji’s protection. She was just testing the waters.</p><p>“Outsiders are not allowed to enter the Saint Hall. Was this Dao Qiongcang’s order?” Dao Xuanji finally looked at the young man at the entrance of the hall, but she did not bring up the issue about the lives and deaths of the judges.</p><p>“Yes, sir!” Xi replied.</p><p>“What about you? You’re only the Chief of the Transformation Division.”</p><p>“I have special permission to report directly to Hallmaster Dao during the operation of the Heavenly Group!”</p><p>“Alright, this rule is now waived.” Dao Xuanji waved his horsetail whisk and shattered the past.</p><p>Xi was stunned.</p><p>He stared at the new Hallmaster Xuanji.</p><p>He then looked at Jiang Nayi, who bowed to Dao Xuanji with a grateful expression, and realized something.</p><p>It was not a big deal to remove a rule.</p><p>However, to use the method to protect Jiang Nayi to counter the Chief of the Transformation division, there was a lot to be learnt from that!</p><p>It was only now that Xi understood how someone like Jiang Nayi could enter the Saint Hall.</p><p>Clowns had their uses too!</p><p>Dao Xuanji wanted to use Jiang Nayi to test the hearts of everyone on the Sacred Mountain and figure out their stance after the new Hallmaster took the throne!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
