He searched, purified and self-inspected…</p><p>Yet he found no trace of the curse left on him.</p><p>Even after bathing and changing clothes promptly, as if washing away bad luck, he still felt a sense of unease.</p><p>It was like the most common curse in the mundane world, “May you bear children without an anus.” Once uttered, who knew if it might come true?</p><p>In the realm of Spiritual Cultivation, curses could manifest invisibly, leaving imprints either in spirit or in the soul, always traceable.</p><p>But Dao Qiongcang found nothing!</p><p>Perhaps his own cultivation level was too low, or perhaps the curse of Five Decays of Heaven and Man was of a higher order?</p><p>His one bow, like that shooting star across the night sky, came and went without a trace.</p><p>“Perhaps… it’s fake?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang took out his Divine Sinan.</p><p>He considered another possibility: perhaps Five Decays of Heaven and Man simply couldn’t lock onto him.</p><p>He might have been blowing hot air, appearing to curse extensively but leaving nothing behind.</p><p>Setting up an altar, burning three incenses, then removing everything afterward…</p><p>It was all for show, making enemies believe they had been cursed.</p><p>Unable to find anything, unable to solve the problem at its root, he felt increasingly anxious—this curse was more sophisticated!</p><p>Especially since Five Decays of Heaven and Man knew he was targeting the unpredictable Dao Qiongcang…</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was confident in his own abilities.</p><p>He thought, that perhaps Five Decays of Heaven and Man, in order to prevent his curse from being discovered by Divine Secret, made it seem like a curse had been cast when it hadn’t. This tactic was very likely.</p><p>By “attacking the heart,” making one feel cursed, obstructing subsequent actions, attributing all obstacles to this curse.</p><p>In time, even if one hadn’t been cursed, they would feel cursed, resenting heaven and blaming others, and everything would go awry.</p><p>However, the more one feared, the more adversity they encountered, worsening their situation.</p><p>Thus, one could be trapped in a vicious cycle.</p><p>“A curse without a curse is more ingenious than a curse with a curse!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang believed that if he mastered the art of curses, he would use this technique of non-cursing even more, especially against clever opponents.</p><p>But now, unable to find the curse’s imprint, he had no idea what Five Decays of Heaven and Man was planning.</p><p>How would that one bow affect him? Would he truly fall into misfortune…</p><p>“Phew.”</p><p>The scent of osmanthus interrupted Dao Qiongcang’s thoughts.</p><p>The night breeze condensed into the figure of the Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body.</p><p>“Just now, crimson approached the mountain, the great array defenseless, I wanted to stop it, why didn’t you let me?” The Ninth Divine Priest approached the Saint Hall with a puzzled expression.</p><p>“That was aimed at me, and if you took it, then it would be my fault.”</p><p>“What was that?”</p><p>“The curse of Five Decays of Heaven and Man.”</p><p>Upon hearing those words, the Ninth Divine Priest’s eyes flickered with a hint of surprise. After a while, she said, “Impressive?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang did not answer, lowering his eyes and grabbing his Divine Sinan.</p><p>The Ninth Divine Priest’s gaze followed, observing as Dao Qiongcang cast his divinations. The usual colors of gold and white that symbolized good fortune and regularity were absent.</p><p>In its place, there shone only a crimson glow!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang calculated nine times, each time the Divine Sinan flashed crimson.</p><p>The Ninth Divine Priest was shaken. Even though she didn’t understand Divine Secrets, she could read colors.</p><p>It was the first time she saw Dao Qiongcang deduce such an ominous omen!</p><p>“What are you calculating?”</p><p>“Myself.”</p><p>At these words, the Ninth Divine Priest’s expression turned reproachful.</p><p>“Why didn’t you activate the great array? Why didn’t you let Saint Mountain defend itself? The mountain possesses great vital energy…”</p><p>“Has there been any news of Godhood Sword Xuan Cang?”</p><p>The Ninth Divine Priest was taken aback, unable to speak.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang chuckled. “I’m starting to hear bad news. This is the first one, and I believe it won’t be the last.”</p><p>The Ninth Divine Priest was speechless.</p><p>She could tell Dao Qiongcang was implying that the Cang Godhood Sword, which guarded the mountain’s vital energy, was still missing.</p><p>If the curse tainted the vital energy of Saint Mountain, the blame would fall squarely on him.</p><p>Yet, how incredibly vast was the vital energy of Saint Mountain?</p><p>Even without the Cang Godhood Sword, other divine objects could guard it.</p><p>The audacity of Five Decays of Heaven and Man to curse Saint Mountain’s vital energy would undoubtedly provoke a massive backlash</p><p>Death on the spot was even possible!</p><p>However, matters had come to this point, saying more was futile.</p><p>“You have a solution, right?” The Ninth Divine Priest looked at Dao Qiongcang with expectant eyes. Dao Qiongcang was exceptionally knowledgeable, far beyond the reach of ordinary people.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang glanced at the deep crimson on his Divine Sinan, then looked back at the Ninth Divine Priest, shaking his head with a wry smile.</p><p>The Ninth Divine Priest grew anxious.</p><p>“You must have a way!”</p><p>“Since I’ve received a bow, then I shall accept it calmly rather than panicking like a sparrow.”</p><p>“How is that a solution? Think of something using your… Divine Secret!”</p><p>“Divine Secret can foresee trouble but never resolve them. It’s a process, not a result.”</p><p>“What do we do then?”</p><p>“Since it’s received, then accept it.”</p><p>The Ninth Divine Priest was furious.</p><p>This was the child she had watched grow up.</p><p>She worried for Dao Qiongcang, but he seemed not to care about his own safety.</p><p>What was to be done?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
