Your soul is trembling! Your emotions are boiling! Your blood is raging!”</p><p>“Everything about you shows that you are very excited!”</p><p>“But you’re just hunched over and your head is lowered. You even have so many scruples when you call out? So many burdens?”</p><p>“Who do you think you are? Are you more important than Master Siren and Elder Dao the Flamboyant?”</p><p>Cao Erzhu was furious when he heard this. Was this thing trying to mock him?</p><p>He straightened up, raised his head, and thrust out his chest. He let his violent primitive emotions push his body forward and took a firm step forward.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>He swung his right hand and hammered the air.</p><p>At the same time, he crushed the big rocks under his feet to show his masculinity.</p><p>“Are you f*cking kidding me?”</p><p>Jin Ren almost came apart when he saw this.</p><p>He caught a glimpse of something from the blue-purple electric current on the big guy’s body.</p><p>However, he had never expected that the intelligence report about ‘having an intellectual problem’ was actually true!</p><p>“Are you such a loser? You don’t even dare to vent your emotions?”</p><p>“When you’re excited, scream. If you’re unhappy, hit out. It’s so simple. Don’t you understand even the basics?”</p><p>“Are you under some weapon prohibition order or controlled by someone? How could Kui Leihan have fathered such a loser like you?”</p><p>“I’m not a loser!” Cao Erzhu was furious.</p><p>He suddenly realized that the voice was not from the demon in his mind, but came from the surroundings.</p><p>The words ‘weapon prohibition order’ reminded him that the person who spoke to him was not a fake. It was someone who knew about the existence of the iron command token on his father’s neck!</p><p>Cao Erzhu looked around and found the only spiritual senses that was present was stored in a pile of scrap metal.</p><p>“Who are you?” He asked angrily. “Why did you call me a loser? I’m not a loser!”;</p><p>“Very good!” The voice that came from the pile of scrap metal was even louder than his. “It’s this aura. Look, does anyone care about you?”</p><p>Cao Erzhu was stunned by the shout and looked around.</p><p>His voice was already very loud and made the snow fall. However, no one paid any attention to him.</p><p>He looked up and saw that the battle in the Nine Heavens was still ongoing.</p><p>The old immortal Mei’s dual swords in the sword image couldn’t break the barrier, but he didn’t stop there.</p><p>He raised his hands and drew a faint line on the Taicheng Sword with his fingertips.</p><p>“Nine Swords Techniques, Infinite Number!”</p><p>The sword image seemed to have gone crazy. The Nine Swords illusion around its body transformed into countless swords. Each sword slashed down fiercely and hit a point on the barrier membrane as it hacked away desperately.</p><p>“Clang, clang…”</p><p>“Boom boom…”</p><p>The explosions in the Nine Heavens did not stop.</p><p>Circles of air currents exploded, and the dazzling and gorgeous halos were like fireworks that could only be seen in Jade Capital City.</p><p>All of these were more direct than venting one’s emotions, and it made people feel more satisfied.</p><p>“No one is looking at me, I am not important…”</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s heart surged, but he was also somewhat disappointed.</p><p>He was not destined to be the main character in those novels. Even his loud shouts did not attract any attention.</p><p>The voice from the pile of scrap metal sounded again, filled with a strong sense of regret.</p><p>“You still say that you’re not a loser?”</p><p>“You only know how to gather your aura and roar at a remnant thought like me. If this isn’t bullying the weak and fearing the strong, what is?”</p><p>“I’m not…” Cao Erzhu waved his hands repeatedly and retreated. How could he be a person who bullied the weak and feared the strong?</p><p>He did not know that there was a remnant will of a true person in this pile of scrap metal. He was just a little emotional and had no intention of humiliating it.</p><p>“If you aren’t, then why did you come up the mountain? Are you here to watch a show?”</p><p>“I did it because…”</p><p>“Is it important? I’m asking you if it’s important!” The person in the pile of scrap metal seemed to be even more irritable than the old immortal Mei’s sword image.</p><p>“Since you were brought here by Master Siren, then you are not with the Elder Dao the Flamboyant!”</p><p>“Since you’re not here to watch the show, you don’t even dare to shout or cheer when Master Siren is fighting up there!”</p><p>“If you’re not a loser, then who is?”</p><p>“I’m not a loser!!!” Cao Erzhu bent and roared. Purple lightning surged around his body, and the sound waves sent the pile of scrap metal in front of him flying.</p><p>“My business is very important! It is very important! It’s extremely important!”</p><p>“I want revenge!”</p><p>Revenge?</p><p>What revenge?</p><p>Within the remains of the Divine Puppet, Jin Ren was momentarily stunned. In the blink of an eye, he roared even louder.</p><p>“You’re taking revenge on me. What kind of ability is that? Do I have a grudge with you?”</p><p>“If you have the guts, go and f*cking roar at Dao Qiongcang. Do you dare to vent your anger on him?!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s aura was suppressed as he glanced at the sky. “But they are still fighting…”</p><p>“Is their business more important, or is your business more important?”</p><p>“They’re fighting, and you want to wait? What kind of bullshit logic is that!”</p><p>The voice from the pile of scrap metal was furious. “If I were you, I would have shouted out long ago. Who cares if he’s fine or not!”</p><p>“I don’t know how to shout…” Cao Erzhu weakly raised his finger.</p><p>This sentence and the subsequent action, suddenly made Jin Ren lose his temper.</p><p>Little chap.</p><p>I can only say this.</p><p>“I’ll teach you! F*ck!”</p><p>“Mei Siren, do you really want to join the Saint Servant?”</p><p>The battle continued in the sky. Dao Qiongcang was shocked by the old sword saint’s undulating attack.</p><p>He felt that the Thirty Three Heavens Star Weaving array might not be able to withstand the damage caused by Mei Siren.</p><p>“I did not cripple Xu Xiaoshou. What you see of the remains of the Divine Puppet is merely himself…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
