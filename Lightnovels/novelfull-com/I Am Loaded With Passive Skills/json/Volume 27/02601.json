If that child had grown up smoothly, by now… hmm, wouldn’t he or she be as big as Xiao Kongtong?”</p><p>Once?</p><p>Jin Ren caught onto this crucial word.</p><p>If this child belonged to the Eighth Sword Deity and the Holy Emperor of the Yue Clan, how gifted would he or she be?</p><p>And if this child were roughly around the same age as Xiao Kongtong, why had no one heard of him or her in the Five Regions? Had this child faded into the background?</p><p>So…</p><p>“Was there an accident?” Jin Ren asked.</p><p>“Ugh, ugh…” Zhu Yike struggled briefly, realizing he couldn’t get up, so he gave up resisting, resigned to listen passively, knowing there was little choice.</p><p>“Not just one, but many.” Dao Qiongcang shrugged indifferently, gazing into the night sky, lost in thought.</p><p>“The Five Great Holy Emperor aristocratic families place immense value on bloodlines. Within their… hmm, within our ranks, there exists a special way to preserve these bloodlines.”</p><p>“The goal is for descendants with the greatest talents to inherit the Holy Emperor’s position, ensuring perpetual succession… forever.”</p><p>“However, human nature doesn’t conform to such rigid structures; the desire for freedom persists even within the Holy Emperor families.”</p><p>“Every generation sees a few who attempt to defy these ‘rules,’ most of whom are exiled and abandoned by their families.”</p><p>“Do you know what we call such individuals within our ranks?” Dao Qiongcang turned his head.</p><p>“What?” Jin Ren asked. Intrigued, Zhu Yike stopped his restless gaze and swallowed the blood at his lips.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang chuckled softly:</p><p>“Saint Servant!”</p><p>At these words, both Jin Ren and Zhu Yike shuddered.</p><p>Saint Servant?</p><p>This Saint Servant, and that Saint Servant…</p><p>“Not the same kind of Saint Servant.”</p><p>“But strictly speaking, their significance, to some extent, aligns.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang sighed as he looked at the moon halo on the mountain, lamenting, “The injustice faced by those of lower status, driven by the desire for freedom to defy fate… it’s symbolic.”</p><p>Jin Ren pondered.</p><p>So, even the Saint Servants within the Holy Emperor families rebelled?</p><p>“No one wishes to be labeled ‘servant’ for any reason; this term inherently carries derogation.”</p><p>“Even within the Holy Emperor families, these ‘Saint Servants’ have rebelled, not just in one generation but across many.”</p><p>“What do you think the outcome was?” Dao Qiongcang asked.</p><p>Forget Jin Ren—even Zhu Yike now knew the answer.</p><p>After all, the fact that the “Saint Servant” of the Holy Emperor’s aristocratic family was unknown or obscure meant that they had never won.</p><p>“Yes, they have always failed.”</p><p>“Even those with extraordinary talent, comparable to Bazhun’an, faced the same fate.”</p><p>“Including Yue Gongnu, in our generation…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s gaze flickered, lost in thought, and he sighed. “Regardless of how one deduces or speculates, I believe her fate, too, will end in failure.”</p><p>“But Bazhun’an succeeded,” Jin Ren interjected.</p><p>“What defines success?” Dao Qiongcang chuckled. “Is it achieving fame, becoming renowned by all, or is it completely overturning fate to attain freedom?”</p><p>“…” Jin Ren fell silent.</p><p>“If it’s the former, then yes, he has succeeded. If it’s the latter, he has only taken a significant step forward!”</p><p>Even Lord Shou was speechless.</p><p>Zhu Yike trembled even more violently.</p><p>He had a sinking feeling that after tonight, his fate might take a chilling turn.</p><p>After all, did he deserve to hear these things? Was he worthy?</p><p>“Returning to the issue of the child…” Dao Qiongcang quickly brought the conversation back to its seemingly irrelevant core.</p><p>“Many can see Bazhun’an, but few have glimpsed Yue Gongnu.”</p><p>“Within the Holy Emperor families, we are more concerned about her and her child.”</p><p>“This child was not supposed to be born?” Jin Ren picked up the conversation.</p><p>“Correct.” Dao Qiongcang blinked.</p><p>“Once the bloodline of the Holy Emperor mixes with outsiders, their powers are severely diminished. Not to mention, Yue Gongnu is the designated successor of the Yue Clan.”</p><p>“And after this child was born, it would trigger a series of troublesome ‘issues.’”</p><p>“Even if this generation dismisses it and views the Holy Emperor families as insignificant, trouble would arise in the next, and the one after that…”</p><p>“When their talents falter, trouble will arise.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang sighed heavily. “Human nature is always like this.”</p><p>“So, was the child aborted?” Jin Ren felt the conclusion shouldn’t be so straightforward, otherwise Dao Qiongcang wouldn’t have broached such a topic.</p><p>“Many believed so when Yue Gongnu was captured by the Yue Clan and thrown into cold prison.”</p><p>“But in reality?” Jin Ren could milk a conversation for all it was worth.</p><p>“I also mentioned that the Holy Emperor families had their own unique ways of preserving bloodlines, each clan vastly different.” Dao Qiongcang added before continuing:</p><p>“It wasn’t until recently that I discovered Yue Gongnu likely concealed the truth in a way even I didn’t know at that time, deceiving even the elites of the Yue Clan.”</p><p>“Afterwards, she gave birth to the child and somehow managed to send it outside under the watchful eye of the Holy Emperor families.”</p><p>Jin Ren had never been to any of the Holy Emperor families, so he naturally didn’t understand the difficulty of such an act.</p><p>But upon further thought, deceiving and forgetting under the eyes of the Holy Emperor, who excelled in these arts of “forgetting” and “deception,” was no small feat.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
