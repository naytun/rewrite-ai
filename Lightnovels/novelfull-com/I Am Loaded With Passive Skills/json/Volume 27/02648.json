He felt as if he was awake, but it also felt as if he was still asleep.</p><p>The world he saw was grotesque and colorful. There were all kinds of things, squares, circles, rhombus-shaped… There were also all sorts of irregular bodies that glowed with a faint light, but it was all meaningless.</p><p>Amid this chaos, all kinds of powers were scattered around him. Holy Power, power of the ancestral source, Penetrating Divine Senses… They intersected and clashed with each other.</p><p>Under the pressure from external forces and the circumstances of weakness after the war, part of his self was lost.</p><p>Even if he could feel his consciousness as it slowly merged into his body and soul.</p><p>This process was too slow, as if it had taken thousand of years!</p><p>“Yes, I’m in my recovery period…”</p><p>“I just ended a battle with the Holy Emperor. I’ve drained myself too thoroughly this time. In the future, I definitely… can’t do this… anymore!”</p><p>While his consciousness thought about it intermittently, Xu Xiaoshou could finally get some information about the outside world.</p><p>Jade Capital City, Changde Town, Qingyuan Mountain…</p><p>They had all been destroyed!</p><p>The main body and Jin Ren’s mind were connected, but now it seemed to be blocked by some source of power, and the flow of information was no longer as smooth.</p><p>However, the source of this power was not from the enemy, but himself.</p><p>“I am a higher void…”</p><p>He was like a small boat that had lost its course and was adrift in the vast ocean. The wind came from the left and the boat went to the right.</p><p>As he bobbed about, he would even lose his direction.</p><p>Fortunately, the sea was still calm. There would be an end to this loneliness. Xu Xiaoshou knew that he could return.</p><p>He was looking for the lighthouse!</p><p>Or someone used an external force to stimulate him outside the sea and pulled him back suddenly.</p><p>Or…</p><p>“Pfft.”</p><p>In the midst of the shattered bobbing about, Xu Xiaoshou seemed to hear a soft sound.</p><p>It was too familiar!</p><p>It was the sound of the infernal white flame.</p><p>He struggled to lift something that seemed to be his eyelids and looked over in that direction…</p><p>He seemed to see a long street amid the hazy image.</p><p>Under the night sky, a little girl ran over. Her face was blurry and she held a stick of candied haws in her hand.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>A single spark could instantly set the prairie ablaze.</p><p>The white Infernal instantly repelled everything else and drowned out everything in his field of vision.</p><p>Warmth enveloped his entire body.</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked at the broken sword in his hand and his thoughts momentarily went blank.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s body was strong enough to shatter a grade three spiritual sword even when he was asleep, and even…</p><p>He raised his palm.</p><p>His palm felt numb and hot.</p><p>There was no blood on it and it looked like a piece of eternal white jade.</p><p>If this had been an ordinary person’s hand, wouldn’t it be shattered or crippled by this blow?</p><p>In just an instant, Dao Qiongcang analyzed that not only did he suffer from the Recoil damage, but he also had sword wounds and burns…</p><p>“This, what kind of physique is this?”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit stood at the side and stared blankly at everything that took place in front of it. It felt an indescribable sense of discomfort.</p><p>It clearly wanted to protect its owner.</p><p>However, when it saw how this human stabbed his sword at its owner, it chose to stand by and watch.</p><p>After it watched from the sidelines, it felt endless frustration, but did not retaliate. It just stood and watched in a daze…</p><p>It was as if it was clearly very interested in this world, but at the same time it was extremely indifferent. It was simply contradictory!</p><p>After Dao Qiongcang muttered to himself, he pulled the body out of the alchemy cauldron and instantly became suspicious.</p><p>“Something is wrong…”</p><p>This was an intuition!</p><p>Weird, abnormal, deceptive…</p><p>The sudden whim of a demi-saint could not be understood, but it couldn’t be ignored.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang first cast a Great Purification Technique on himself.</p><p>This was because he recalled that his original body had been cursed by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, but there were no marks to detect it.</p><p>However, after this move, he found that he was totally clear. His sacred physique was clean and was not affected by any negative forces.</p><p>“Great Inspection Technique!”</p><p>He cast another Divine Secret technique on himself and scanned his body carefully.</p><p>There was still no abnormality.</p><p>“Da da da…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang used his finger divination technique, and a beam of crimson light instantly shot out from his fingertips!</p><p>He suddenly realized that he was still affected.</p><p>At this moment, the barrier between his ears and his brain seemed to be shattered. He heard a voice that had repeatedly served a reminder to him for an unknown period of time.</p><p>“Warning! Warning! Alert!”</p><p>“Abnormal! Abnormal! Abnormal!”</p><p>The second brain outside of his body had been sending him warning signals. He had received them, but he had inexplicably ignored them.</p><p>The signal seemed to have entered a concave stack. It should have been quickly extracted by his multi-line processing brain, then interpreted and analyzed.</p><p>But now, it was buried beneath countless trivial information.</p><p>What he had interpreted had actually been all superficial and unimportant junk information!</p><p>The important information sank to the bottom, so Dao Qiongcang naturally couldn’t receive the abnormal notifications.</p><p>This kind of power of guidance that he used for himself was specially used to deal with the Holy Emperor’s power of guidance and was simply too strong!</p><p>In the entire world, only one person could do it…</p><p>The Seven Trees Emperor!</p><p>In other words, the Blood World Pearl!</p><p>“Had the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s curse taken effect?”</p><p>“It used a roundabout method to affect both the main body and me?”</p><p>Under the influence of this subjective consciousness, Dao Qiongcang looked around again and discovered that there were too many flaws…</p><p>Why was Greedy the Cat Spirit so indifferent even when it saw him stabbing its master?</p><p>Why was it that his first reaction was to attack Xu Xiaoshou and not to wait and observe?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not the only one who was seriously injured by Bei Huai. Lei Xi’er from the Lei family had also been taken away by Xu Xiaoshou at that time… Where was she now?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
