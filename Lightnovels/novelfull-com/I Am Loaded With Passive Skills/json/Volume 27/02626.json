He will make his own choices.”</p><p>“You think that he’s a child who will be scammed, but I think that you’re a fool. It’s fine if you look down on me, but you’re looking down on everyone in the world!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu scratched his head and said in a low and muffled voice. “Brother Shou, calm down. I will not change my decision. I said that I will join the First Pavilion in the Sky, and I mean it, I will join you.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was choked by Erzhu’s words and fell silent. Now only the sounds of the Qingyuan Mountain great array were left.</p><p>Needless to say, Er Zhu really had his own way of thinking.</p><p>If Brother Shou turned out to be really bad and joining the First Pavilion in the Sky didn’t match his original intentions, he could just leave.</p><p>It was not as if he couldn’t leave. Brother Shou issued an invitation. There was no weapon prohibition order.</p><p>Moreover…</p><p>Cao Erzhu glanced at the old immortal Mei.</p><p>He might not trust the lump of iron in his hand, but he could never doubt the old immortal behind him.</p><p>No matter how reliable that strange uncle was, he couldn’t be more reliable than Brother Shou’s Master Siren. This was the most basic reason, so what were they fighting about?</p><p>There was silence in the void for a long time before a cold snort rang out. He no longer bothered about this matter and said.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you’re about to die!</p><p>Oh?</p><p>You can’t beat me verbally and now you’re threatening me?</p><p>Jin Ren laughed, but all of a sudden, his spiritual senses that was hidden in the Apricot Realm saw that the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale started to beat wildly.</p><p>The high frequency of this heartrate signified a life and death crisis!</p><p>Elder Dao the Flamboyant, are you serious?</p><p>That’s not right. Even if he could touch my spiritual senses and even kill me, how could he affect my main body in the Apricot Realm?</p><p>Under the waterfall at Back Mountain, Yu Zhiwen tried to figure out the way to break through the situation and ensure Xu Xiaoshou’s safety.</p><p>However, she was always distracted by her restless mind and could not get the divination technique right for a long time. This time, the calamity message came through very directly!</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao, are you planning a killing?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen suddenly stood up from under the waterfall, her eyes filled with shock.</p><p>She knew that Hallmaster Dao had a soft spot for Xu Xiaoshou. He had even said that the doors of the Holy Divine Palace would always be open for him.</p><p>Was this anger due to embarrassment?</p><p>That was not right. Why would Hallmaster Dao be angry and embarrassed just because he lost in the battle of words?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen made another divination, and the result was the same.</p><p>She looked around and realized that the Qingyuan Mountain great array was no longer under her control. She could not warn Xu Xiaoshou at all.</p><p>But even if she had to use brute force, she would go over!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen lifted the hem of her skirt and rushed in the direction where Xu Xiashou was.</p><p>To remain for any length of time on Qingyuan Mountain would only lead to disaster!</p><p>She had to tell him, even if it was openly!</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>At this moment, a figure descended from the sky.</p><p>He only had half a head. At this moment, his nose and mouth had condensed. The top was covered by the divine path pattern, and a trace of purple lightning could be seen on it. It was difficult to see his full appearance.</p><p>He held the divine Sinan and his entire body was gray and black, covered in charred dirt. All the gold beads and precious jade on his body were also gone.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen still recognized Hallmaster Dao!</p><p>She turned around and switched directions. She didn’t stop at all. She even pretended that she didn’t recognize the person and ran as fast as a rabbit.</p><p>“Where are you going?” Dao Qiongcang asked coldly.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen trotted in the air and quickly dodged.</p><p>In the end, after she ran around for half a day, she was captured by the Qingyuan Mountain great array.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen stared at Hallmaster Dao with her starry eyes and pursed her lips. She was unhappy and kept quiet.</p><p>“Stay here and don’t think about destroying it. You can’t do it!”</p><p>“What did you want to do?”</p><p>“I’ve already helped you with a proposal.”</p><p>“Huh?” Yu Zhiwen was confused by this turn of events and blushed. She had actually eavesdropped on their conversation.</p><p>“He didn’t give a definite answer. He didn’t know that it was his last chance.”</p><p>“What do you intend to do?” Yu Zhiwen repeated this question as she clenched her fists and had an uneasy feeling.</p><p>“It’s time to wake up from the dream…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang snorted coldly and raised his head.</p><p>The morning light shone on half of his face, and the stone pool under the waterfall immediately turned into a murderous scene.</p><p>“I want to reel in the net and kill him!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
