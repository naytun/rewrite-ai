Isn’t that tantamount to absolute death with no chance of survival?”</p><p>“Don’t speak such words!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang fell silent, refusing to engage further with the Ninth Divine Priest.</p><p>Setting down the Divine Sinan, he gazed into the distant night sky, his expression enraptured. His hands moved through the air in front of him, grasping at something intangible.</p><p>“What are you doing?” The Ninth Divine Priest approached, watching the child act strangely again.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang closed his eyes, his expression entranced, and lamented, “Fate, toying with the uncertain.”</p><p>“I choose to spare him, and in doing so, spare myself. I choose the unknown and the uncertain, which is why I cannot cast the tenth reading.”</p><p>“And this kind of unknown and uncertainty…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang opened his eyes, looking at the Ninth Divine Priest with a wry smile. “This is what makes me Dao Qiongcang.”</p><p>The Ninth Divine Priest couldn’t make sense of what the child was rambling about.</p><p>But now that the child was older and she couldn’t just hit him, she could only change the subject helplessly:</p><p>“Qingyuan Mountain, your demi-saint incarnation, how is the situation being handled?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang wiped all expressions from his face, answering seriously, “Perhaps, an unexpected event is about to occur…”</p><p>The Ninth Divine Priest’s eyes widened at this revelation. After taking a deep breath, she turned and left the Saint Hall.</p><p>What a waste of a trip!</p><p>…</p><p>Below Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>The night was calm, devoid of malevolent forces.</p><p>Mei Siren held a folding fan and led a small donkey. Just as he was about to ascend the mountain, he saw a restless young man.</p><p>“Young man, come over here.”</p><p>With those words, he halted the young man, who was as sturdy as a tree stump.</p><p>Cao Erzhu was in a hurry on his journey. Upon turning around, he saw an ethereal old divine figure tying his small donkey to a tree. After a moment’s thought, he untied it again.</p><p>For some reason, his restlessness was subdued by the old man’s calm actions and words.</p><p>Cao Erzhu hurried forward, dusting off the dirt from his robe and kneeling:</p><p>“Cao Erzhu pays respects to the venerable deity!”</p><p>At this moment, Cao Erzhu had no thoughts of silence or concealment, not even the various reminders from his late father crossed his mind.</p><p>He was definitely a good person!</p><p>The dignified aura, the affinity with nature, the irresistible charm that drew people near at first glance…</p><p>Cao Erzhu didn’t even need to think much.</p><p>With one look, he saw the myriad illusory sword-wielding disciples behind the venerable deity, all facing towards the Formal Path.</p><p>He knew that this was a true old deity, someone who could stand up for him!</p><p>Cao Erzhu could even doubt Lord Li’s intentions, but he would never doubt this universally recognized good person!</p><p>“Please, venerable deity, stand up for Erzhu! My father, he… he…” Cao Erzhu burst into tears, unable to speak.</p><p>Mei Siren stroked his beard, pondering for a moment, unable to recall having taught this person.</p><p>He helped the young man to his feet and calmly asked, “Take your time. What happened to your father?”</p><p>“He… he was killed, his head chopped off and put in a wine barrel. I don’t know who the murderer is. Lord Li said the murderer might be on the mountain, so I want to go up and find him…”</p><p>“Your father’s name?”</p><p>“He’s called Cao Yihan, and I’m Cao Erzhu. He lived in the town. I just stopped by the mountain for a day, and when I returned, he… he…” Erzhu clung to the old deity’s arm, sobbing uncontrollably.</p><p>Honestly, Mei Siren was startled by the name “Cao Yihan.”</p><p>Soon, he realized it was likely a misunderstanding, probably just a coincidence.</p><p>After all, he sensed mostly the aura of the Ancient Sword Technique from this child.</p><p>“Don’t cry… don’t cry…”</p><p>Mei Siren comforted the stout man taller than himself, unable to get his hand around him or pat his back.</p><p>Once Cao Erzhu had calmed himself a bit, Mei Siren asked, “Who is Lord Li?”</p><p>“Lord Li? It’s Lord Li!” Cao Erzhu wiped his tears in confusion.</p><p>Mei Siren pondered briefly before asking, “How do you know that the murderer who killed your father is on the mountain?”</p><p>“That thing!” Cao Erzhu pointed at the great array of Qingyuan Mountain. “Divine Secret!”</p><p>Cao Yihan, Divine Secret…</p><p>When so many coincidences came together, Mei Siren couldn’t believe it was just a mere coincidence.</p><p>“Child, have you heard of the Ten High Nobles?”</p><p>“I have, my father is one of them.”</p><p>Below Qingyuan Mountain, a sudden hush descended, leaving only the sound of the small donkey crunching snow and leaves by the tree.</p><p>This Cao Yihan was the same as that Cao Yihan?</p><p>Moreover, Kui Leihan was dead?</p><p>The one who killed him with the Divine Secret… was Dao Qiongcang?</p><p>Tonight felt more surreal than a dream to Mei Siren.</p><p>He had casually encountered a child on the road, someone who exuded the aura of a friend and turned out to be a child of the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>The news this child brought could potentially shake the entire spiritual cultivation world.</p><p>The karma of this person seemed no less than Xu Xiaoshou’s.</p><p>“Why do you call me old deity? Do you know me?” Mei Siren scrutinized the child again, wary that this might be Dao Qiongcang’s scheme.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
