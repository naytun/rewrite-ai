Just the two of us. Let’s explore the place together.”</p><p>Just the two of us?</p><p>Gou Wuyue raised his eyebrows.</p><p>“I know, this is very ambiguous.”</p><p>“But don’t you think that Bazhun’an and Wen Ting, Elder You and Master Siren’s deeds have all become the stuff of legends?”</p><p>“And all you need to become a legend is me?”</p><p>Gou Wuyue couldn’t help but fall into deep thought.</p><p>He thought about how he could use his sword to cut off Elder Dao the Flamboyant’s pretentious aura.</p><p>“You’re not an ancient swordsman.” Gou Wuyue said.</p><p>“Very good. It seems that if I were an ancient swordsman, you would be very willing to form a good story with me. And because of you, I’ve actually already started to cultivate the Ancient Sword Technique…” Dao Qiongcang continued.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>“I have already formed the Innate Sword Intent.”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>“You should know how difficult this is for a Divine Sorcerer. You always scoff at my sweat and hard work…”</p><p>“Shut up, Elder Dao the Flamboyant!”</p><p>Gou Wuyue couldn’t hold it in any longer. The veins on his head popped up. In the end… he chose to skip the topic. “Why the Southern Region?”</p><p>“You should be asking, why not the Southern Region?”</p><p>“The Southern Region is the Land of Sin. It is the best place to become the ancestor of God.”</p><p>“Even the hands of the Holy Divine Palace can’t reach into the Southern Region… Do you know why?” Dao Qiongcang calmly kept him in suspense.</p><p>“Why?” Gou Wuyue’s curiosity was piqued.</p><p>“Because I’ve never thought to extend my hand there in the past thirty years. Otherwise, do you really think the Southern Region can’t be suppressed.” Dao Qiongcang was calm.</p><p>Gou Wuyue was shocked.</p><p>He looked at the flamboyant guy’s half-smiling expression and didn’t know if he was joking.</p><p>If he wasn’t…</p><p>Didn’t that mean that when this guy took over the Holy Divine Palace, he had already planned his retreat?</p><p>Impossible!</p><p>At that time, he was young and arrogant.</p><p>Even Bazhun’an, Kui Leihan and others cultivated the heaven-defying path and did heaven-defying actions then!</p><p>Even he himself had to kill for over ten years before he calmed down after he became the Ruler of the white-clothed people.</p><p>When he finally felt that the road was shallow and he could no longer escape; he could only cultivate in the deep pit to find a new way out.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang, how could it come to this?</p><p>“If you thought about Bazhun’an, Cao Yihan, The Divine, etc., one was crippled, one was suppressed, and one was controlled by others. Each of them regressed by thirty years.”</p><p>“If you are thinking about yourself, I think that only you can free yourself from your shackles.”</p><p>“If you suspect me, I can tell you frankly…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang seemed to have the Mind Reading Technique. In the midst of the calm Dead Sea, he said firmly.</p><p>“I, Dao Qiongcang, will never fail. There will always be a way to escape unscathed, whether it’s the me from 30 years ago or the me 30 years later.”</p><p>Gou Wuyue fell silent.</p><p>This person was too terrifying!</p><p>“I was originally a little tempted…”</p><p>“But now that I’ve said it, are you afraid? Dao Qiongcang interrupted. “You’re afraid of me? You cultivated the Carefreeness Sword, and you want to transcend it? How can you be afraid of me?”</p><p>“You don’t have to provoke me.” Gou Wuyue found it funny. He looked around the Dead Sea and calmed down. “This place suits me well…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang shook his head and said slowly. “Maybe I don’t know what it means to be reckless and how to transcend. But I know the rules and constraints better than you!”</p><p>He pointed upwards. “You cultivated the sword at the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe. You were trapped by the rules. If you succeeded in the sword, you would have transcended the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.”</p><p>He pointed at the Dead Sea beneath his feet. “You can cultivate your sword here and use the restrictive spell as a trap. If you succeed, you will be able to surpass the restrictive spell. For example, you will be able to see my Divine World.”</p><p>He pointed to the south and looked into the distance. “But if you practice the sword in the Southern Region, you will be trapped by the rules of the continent and the human order…”</p><p>Stop there.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang did not say anything until this moment.</p><p>Gou Wuyue’s eyes flashed slightly, and he remained silent.</p><p>After a long while, he looked intently at Dao Qiongcang, who was clad in his single robe with his loose flowing hair, and shook his head slowly.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang made his final move. “If you follow me and use me as your trap, you will be supreme if you succeed to form a sword!” He said firmly.</p><p>Gou Wuyue was shocked.</p><p>He had not said anything and his face was devoid of any expression. Dao Qiongcang could still read minds?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang leaned over with an indescribable charm.</p><p>“Do you believe in the Dead Sea, the world, or… me?”</p><p>With that, he turned around and left and headed for the exit of the Dead Sea. He no longer had any lingering thought or any words of advice.</p><p>Four Symbols Secret Realm, Black Water Stream.</p><p>“Didn’t you say that you and I would be going to the Southern Region?”</p><p>Gou Wuyue had endured it all the way, but after they arrived at the site, he couldn’t hold it in anymore.</p><p>This was clearly not the way to the Southern Region!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was still searching for someone!</p><p>“Don’t you think our relationship is too ambiguous, based on what you just said? When Dao Qiongcang heard this, he distanced himself from the person beside him with slight disdain.</p><p>“You said it yourself…” Gou Wuyue almost lost control when he saw the other party’s expression. After he took a deep breath, he kept his mouth shut.</p><p>“Do you know what kind of relationship is the most stable? Dao Qiongcang chatted casually as he looked for someone.</p><p>“A triangular relationship! For example, the triangular sadomasochism, the tripod cauldron, the legend of the Three Mountains, and so on. They only remember ‘Kui Leihan, Bazhun’an, and the unpredictable Dao Qiongcang’, but they don’t remember that the next statement actually begins with your name, Gou Wuyue.”</p><p>“Then do you know what kind of situation is the most beneficial for development?”</p><p>“The situation of swords and sabers in a clash! For example, if the Holy Divine Palace and the Saint Servant fight, the two families will become stronger. For example, if there is a saber and a sword, they will…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
