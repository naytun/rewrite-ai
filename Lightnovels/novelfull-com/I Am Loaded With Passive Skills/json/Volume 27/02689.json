It might not be suitable for others.”</p><p>The onlookers felt their scalps go numb.</p><p>What kind of ruthless person was this? He was simply too crazy.</p><p>He even studied the subject of death and used his own body for research. He was indeed a researcher!</p><p>“What was the success rate? How many times have you tried it? If it’s good, I’ll introduce my friend to try it too…” The second true body spoke rapidly because he saw through his Perception that Fang Wenxin seemed to have noticed something unusual.</p><p>He tried his best to use his own aura and the Holy Emperor Lv.0 ‘Swallow the Mountains and Rivers’ to continue to guide everyone’s emotions in the direction he wanted.</p><p>Fang Wenxin was still able to break through the influence. He walked out and his expression underwent a slight change as he said.</p><p>“Elder Yu, Elder Zhong, something is wrong. This is… the Five Decays of Heaven and Man?”</p><p>Elder Yu looked up and glanced at him. Then he hummed and lowered his head.</p><p>With a whoosh, he suddenly raised his head and had a shocked expression.</p><p>“Yes, it’s the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. He had already undergone sanctification!”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi didn’t hear anything unrelated to the question at all. He was still in the midst of explaining his doubts to his friend Xu.</p><p>“The probability is quite high. I’ve studied it seven or eight times and failed before…”</p><p>Fang Wenxin squeezed the Blood Shadow copper coin and his Holy Power erupted. He interrupted Elder Zhong and sent everyone flying. At the same time, he shouted.</p><p>“Everyone, leave!”</p><p>“Zhong Yuanzi, wake up!”</p><p>“What are you doing…?” The second true body disappeared at that moment, unaffected by Fang Wenxin’s Holy power. When he came back, he looked at the people around and frowned.</p><p>The Space Dao Disc beneath his feet had disappeared. He raised the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff that he had borrowed from its main body and knocked it on Fang Wenxin’s forehead.</p><p>“Time, reverse flow.”</p><p>Fang Wenxin looked at the dust on his robe and fell into deep thought.</p><p>He was almost hit by the guy who did his chest expansion exercises and couldn’t help but frown.</p><p>Suddenly, he heard a roar.</p><p>“Kings, princes, generals, and ministers, are they of different species?!”</p><p>This fellow…</p><p>How many times had he shouted?</p><p>The second true body spoke quickly without any pause.</p><p>“Elder Zhong, I know what you want to say. It’s about the will switch before the Clone dies. If we use these three methods together, there’s a high chance of success.”</p><p>“The point is, can you tell me exactly what the probability will be?”</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>The notes were still there—it was recorded in the jade scroll. He did not erase anything nor had he been distracted in the middle… Why did it feel like he suddenly couldn’t keep up with the progress?</p><p>What were they talking about?</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi was overjoyed. This little friend was indeed a bosom friend who knew what he wanted to say.</p><p>“About ninety percent!” He said directly. “I failed once, but my main body did not die. With some tricks, I can still be resurrected in a demi-saint body. Otherwise, you wouldn’t be able to see me now, right?”</p><p>It meant…</p><p>100%?</p><p>At this moment, Fang Wenxin regained his senses.</p><p>“Something’s wrong!”</p><p>He was about to look at Elder Yu to remind him.</p><p>Then he turned around and met Xu Xiaoshou’s smiling face.</p><p>“This is the Five Decays of Heaven and Man!”</p><p>“This is the Five Decays of Heaven and Man!”</p><p>The two of them spoke in unison. Their tones, emotions, and even the small pauses that they used were the same.</p><p>The hairs on Fang Wenxin’s arms stood on end, and the back of his head went numb.</p><p>Elder Yu raised his head and looked over. He saw Xu Xiaoshou turn around with an insincere smile on his face.</p><p>Both their eyes widened and their mouths opened at the same time.</p><p>“Yes, it’s the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. He had already undergone sanctification!”</p><p>“Yes, it’s the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. He had already undergone sanctification!”</p><p>Their emotions and pauses were the same. Other than their voices, they were almost carved out of the same mold!</p><p>Elder Yu’s eyes almost popped out of his eye sockets and landed on Xu Xiaoshou’s nose.</p><p>He covered his mouth in disbelief. “How did you…”</p><p>Everyone who stood at the side was shocked. How did it suddenly become like this? It was a little scary!</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi was also startled.</p><p>Xi was so frightened that he retreated rapidly…</p><p>It was over!</p><p>It was indeed Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>Now, he had the force and started to exert his strength…</p><p>It was not over yet!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was no less disgusting than Hallmaster Dao and had even mastered the skill of ‘parroting’.</p><p>After he swept his eyes all around, he could once again look at Fang Wenxin.</p><p>When Fang Wenxin opened his mouth, his aura erupted.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou used the spatial teleportation ahead of time and evacuated everyone.</p><p>“Everyone, leave!”</p><p>“Everyone, leave!”</p><p>They spoke in unison again!</p><p>At this time, sand and snow blew about everywhere at the Southern Zone gate. No one fell to the ground because they had all been sent away in advance.</p><p>After a pause, the second true body’s eyes widened and he shouted.</p><p>“Zhong Yuanzi, wake up… Uh, there’s no need to say it. D*mn it…”</p><p>That’s right, Zhong Yuanzi didn’t need to wake up anymore. He was so awake that he couldn’t be awakened!</p><p>Fang Wenxin looked at the weirdo in disbelief, who scratched his head and even appeared embarrassed.</p><p>He racked his brains, unable to figure out how Xu Xiaoshou could suddenly read minds. At this moment, after the other party scratched his head, he suddenly flew into the sky under everyone’s shocked gazes.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At the Southern Zone gate, everyone looked up.</p><p>As the wind, snow and fragrance of the osmanthus lingered around him, Xu Xiaoshou’s robe fluttered and his sleeves flapped. He stood in the sky with his hands behind his back and looked down in disdain. He had a vile and weird expression.</p><p>“Gentlemen, the show is over!”</p><p>He then looked at Zhong Yuanzi, who had snapped out of his dazed state.</p><p>“Elder Zhong, I really don’t want to ‘threaten’ you in this manner, but I really have to remind you that you’re too focused on your research.”</p><p>“You met secretly with a Saint Servant and inadvertently secretly passed on the rebirth method to the Tower Master of the First Pavilion in the Sky. If I didn’t bring it up, that Elder Dao the Flamboyant could have used this crime to punish you.”</p><p>“Just as you thought, the Holy Divine Palace is not a good place for researchers. I can only say this. Come to the First Pavilion in the Sky for tea whenever you are free. I will serve you for the rest of my life as a student.”</p><p>After he said that.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou leaned back, and at the same time, the wounds all over his body cracked. They emitted a fragrance that was even more nourishing than the Holy Medicine.</p><p>The fishes jumped up and dove down gracefully.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The ghost beast Greedy the Cat Spirit’s eyes turned red. It paused for a moment before it could not resist the temptation of blood.</p><p>It suddenly broke free from the Blood Shadow copper coin’s restraint, that was temporarily out of control due to the owner’s absent-mindedness, and rushed impatiently in the direction of the blood food.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>It bit down hard.</p><p>He was cut in half.</p><p>In the midst of everyone’s shock, they could vaguely see the white flames that gushed out of the mouth of Greedy the Cat Spirit after it swallowed Xu Xiaoshou.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
