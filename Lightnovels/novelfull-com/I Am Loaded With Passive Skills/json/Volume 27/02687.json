It was really difficult for him to blend in.</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivation world was indeed as powerful as his father had said!</p><p>There were more than a handful of demi-saints at the gate of the city and he had not even entered yet.</p><p>These people were clearly enemies, but in the quest for true knowledge, they were prepared to turn hostility into friendship and discussed academic issues calmly.</p><p>Was this the Spiritual Cultivation World?</p><p>It was too fascinating!</p><p>Cao Erzhu actually wanted to reveal his lightning-type Power Upanishad Formation, join the discussion and ask Senior Zhong Yuanzi for advice.</p><p>Anyone could tell that this old senior surnamed Zhong was very powerful!</p><p>Er Zhu had a whole load of questions to ask, but it was difficult to express them.</p><p>Because his father had warned him that the Power Upanishad Formation could be possessed by someone else, so he couldn’t reveal it.</p><p>He had to suppress himself.</p><p>At this moment, Brother Shou stood up!</p><p>Even though the crowd in front of them argued and quarreled to a certain extreme, they were still led by the Elemental Divine Envoy Zhong Yuanzi.</p><p>My Brother Shou can still suppress everyone.</p><p>He even dared to tell Zhong Yuanzi that he was wrong.</p><p>This scene simply made Cao Erzhu’s blood churn with excitement.</p><p>His entire body trembled, just like that night on Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>Unlike a great battle, this sort of discussion about Spiritual Cultivation at the demi-saint level had a great impact on one’s soul and mind. Although it was intangible, it was enough to make one’s scalp tingle.</p><p>Cao Erzhu recalled what Brother Shou had taught him that night.</p><p>If you can’t suppress it, then don’t suppress it anymore!</p><p>He arched his back and clenched his fists. As he faced the crowd in front of him, he let out a heart-wrenching roar.</p><p>“Kings, princes, generals and ministers, are they of different species?”</p><p>The world suddenly fell silent.</p><p>With a swish, nearly a hundred pairs of eyes turned to look at him.</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s excitement fizzled out. His face was as red as a monkey’s butt and he suddenly felt a little… awkward?</p><p>But very soon…</p><p>He realized that Brother Shou was right!</p><p>Not many people paid attention to him, even if he stood out like a sore thumb. After a brief pause, these people quickly turned around and continued their discussion.</p><p>“Who was that?”</p><p>“I wonder what he’s up to…”</p><p>“What you said seemed interesting, but isn’t your enlightenment a little off? Aren’t we talking about Spiritual Cultivation?”</p><p>“He’s just a troublemaker, don’t bother about him. Lord Shou, continue!”</p><p>The second true body was so frightened that his body twitched.</p><p>This passerby was right. Although Zhu Bao was a treasure, but sometimes he was too much!</p><p>This fellow almost broke up the lively discussion around him… He turned around and noticed that Fang Wenxin, Xi, and the others had regained their senses. He felt that the situation was not good.</p><p>“Erzhu, what is the purpose of the First Pavilion in the Sky?”</p><p>The second true body deliberately suppressed the heated discussion and diverted everyone’s attention to Cao Erzhu again.</p><p>Cao Erzhu had just relaxed when he became the center of attention once again. His entire body tensed up. However, he knew this question. He had just been taught at Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>“End the mistakes and rewrite the future!!!”</p><p>Wow, that was a mighty shout… The second true body’s mouth twitched. He endured the overwhelming sense of shame and hurriedly looked at Zhong Yuanzi.</p><p>“Senior Zhong, I know you have a lot of questions to ask, but there’s no time for that right now.”</p><p>“The direction of your research is exactly the same as our First Pavilion in the sky. However, it is obvious that you are at a dead end.”</p><p>“Let’s put it this way. In the future, when you have time, let’s have tea and we can sit and discuss the Dao.”</p><p>After he heard this voice, Xi came to his senses.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, what are you up to this time?</p><p>In front of so many people from the Holy Divine Palace, he had dared to poach a senior from the Council of Ten?</p><p>Fang Wenxin saw Zhong Yuanzi’s eyes flicker and was aware that something was wrong.</p><p>The second true body took the lead again. With his aura, he once again suppressed everyone’s criticism and interrupted everyone.</p><p>“Elder Zhong, let’s not talk about anything else. I have another question to ask.”</p><p>“Oh?” Zhong Yuanzi looked at his new close friend and hurriedly waved his hand. “Speak!”</p><p>“It’s not really a matter of Spiritual Cultivation. It’s probably related to the aspect of the spirit and soul….”</p><p>“Oh? That’s good!” The crowd at the side became excited again.</p><p>Fang Wenxin wanted to say something but he was suppressed by the eager Spiritual Cultivators and the overexcited Zhong Yuanzi.</p><p>“The aspect of the spirit and soul. That’s the higher level of Spiritual Cultivation! Lord Shou, tell me!”</p><p>“The First Pavilion in the Sky is still researching these questions? Where is the First Pavilion in the Sky?”</p><p>“My little friend, quick, tell me!”</p><p>The second true body glanced at Fang Wenxin and the other people who had awakened from their daze. He took a deep breath and ignored them. His expression soon turned sorrowful.</p><p>“Old Zhong, you might not be aware, but I have a friend…”</p><p>“He’s very talented. He even managed to form a clone before, but his main body fell unconscious after a battle. He clearly took a lot of spiritual herbs and his body had recovered to its perfect state, but strangely, he could not wake up!”</p><p>“My friend consulted me. My personal feeling is that there is something wrong with his spirit and soul. It is as if he is in a dream, but it doesn’t feel right…”</p><p>“May I ask what are Elder Zhong’s thoughts about this? Have you done any research on this before?”</p><p>“Or you can just tell me how to wake him up. My friend is quite anxious…”</p><p>Xi was totally stunned for quite some time after he heard this.</p><p>His first reaction was that Xu Xiaoshou’s friend seemed familiar. Do I know him too?</p><p>Soon, he realized that this so-called friend might be Xu Xiaoshou himself?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
