Had his main body fallen into such a dilemma?</p><p>“Elder Zhong!”</p><p>Xi shouted loudly. He wanted to warn the senior Elemental Divine Envoy, but no one cared about this ancient swordsman, who was an outsider.</p><p>Xi was so anxious that he was about to go crazy. He turned to look at Fang Wenxin, and tried to signal to the old man from the red-clothed people to stop Elder Zhong.</p><p>Fang Wenxin was confused.</p><p>Of course, he noticed the gaze.</p><p>However, who was this young man…</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi came back to his senses after the discussion on various topics like the 100%, the errors and the First Pavilion in the Sky that would give a person sleepless nights. He focused on his little friend’s difficulty.</p><p>“I’ve studied that before.” He said decisively.</p><p>“Oh?” The second true body’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Xi’s face turned green as he shouted. “Elder Zhong, don’t tell him…”</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The ghost beast, Greedy the Cat Spirit roared as if it had adapted to the restrictive power of the Blood Shadow copper coin and stomped on it with its claw.</p><p>The crowd scattered in panic momentarily, but they were unwilling to leave, so they regrouped again.</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi looked at Fang Wenxin in reproach.</p><p>Fang Wenxin felt a little apologetic.</p><p>Xi was dumbfounded.</p><p>After a pause, he prepared himself and just as he was about to warn him again…</p><p>“Kings, princes, generals and ministers, are they of different species?!”</p><p>Very abruptly, from far behind, there was another explosion that charged into the crowd – in the form of a passionate shout.</p><p>Xi was in complete despair.</p><p>No one even turned around to pay attention to this sentence. Then who would care about the voice of a small ancient swordsman like him?</p><p>This world was sick…</p><p>At the Southern Zone gate, Zhong Yuanzi’s small class continued.</p><p>“I’ve encountered your friend’s situation too many times!”</p><p>“He must have overexerted himself, just like me. Every time I failed in my research on element fusion, it was the same…”</p><p>“My main body had been blown up more than thirty times. Sometimes, I can rely on the blood attribute to pull it back. However, my physical body is still in existence and my spiritual will was scattered. The symptoms are exactly the same as your friend’s.”</p><p>“Every time, I have to rely on my demi-saint incarnation to call and stimulate myself. I wasn’t used to it initially, but I got used to it later.”</p><p>“The main thing is that there must be an ‘external intervention.’ Little friend Xu, do you know what that means? Stimulation is most vital!”</p><p>“Oh?” The second true body humbly asked for advice. “I actually thought of this method too… Yes, I even told my friend. He also tried it…”</p><p>“How was it?” Zhong Yuanzi’s face was full of joy. He never thought that he would be able to meet one like-minded person this time.</p><p>“My friend blew up his incarnation! However, the main body still hasn’t woken up…” The second true body was helpless.</p><p>“Then your friend is too ruthless!” The nearby Spiritual Cultivators were all shocked, and felt that this topic was too in-depth for ordinary people to join.</p><p>After all, not everyone had a demi-saint Incarnation or a clone.</p><p>“That was the wrong way.” Zhong Yuanzi laughed and shook his head.</p><p>“Oh? Elder Zhong, tell me quickly. I’m all ears… You guys should listen to it too. It might come in useful in the future!” The second true body successfully aroused everyone’s curiosity, Fang Wenxin included.</p><p>Elder Yu suddenly raised his head from someone’s back and regained his senses.</p><p>He looked down at the noisy crowd from above and felt a little strange.</p><p>What part of it was strange?</p><p>Elder Yu scratched his head, and his eyes flashed red as he continued to join the conversation.</p><p>It was quite fun, not much worse than fishing.</p><p>“Not only did your friend use the wrong method, but he even put the cart before the horse!” Zhong Yuanzi continued.</p><p>“Usually, in such a situation, I’ll just kill the main body and then revive in the demi-saint body. That’s the easiest way.”</p><p>“The disadvantage is that you have to waste a lot of heavenly resources and earthly treasures to create a new demi-saint incarnation.”</p><p>“However, your friend’s situation is a bit special. If he wants his main body to awaken, he will have to kill his Clone!”</p><p>“And the Clone can’t just die simply. It has to die in a special way!”</p><p>“How special?” Ye Xiaotian, Mei Siren, and the others also snapped out of their daze when Xu Xiaoshou asked that question. They exchanged glances with each other before they lowered their heads and kept quiet.</p><p>Fang Wenxin also felt that something was wrong, but he couldn’t figure out what.</p><p>As he listened, he had to control Greedy the Cat Spirit’s struggles and allow this Spiritual Cultivation conference to proceed. This seemed to have deviated from the their original intention…</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>Something was indeed a little off!</p><p>Fang Wenxin suddenly raised his head and looked down. He saw that there were some dirt and grass stains on his robe… Where did that come from?</p><p>When he looked around, everyone seemed a little strange.</p><p>Some of them were sweating and wiping away their sweat, and the smell of body odor was very strong. Some of them scratched their arms from time to time, and some of them were doing chest expansion exercises.</p><p>There were even some people who were very happy and vented their endless energy crazily under the trees.</p><p>“Kings, princes, generals and ministers, are they of different species?”</p><p>It was neither normal nor abnormal-the Spiritual Cultivation World was huge, and there were all kinds of weird people!</p><p>While Fang Wenxin was deep in thought, Zhong Yuanzi had already given the answer.</p><p>“Your friend’s Clone must die in the hands of his closest kin, or rather, die in the hands of someone who can cause your friend’s main body to experience great emotional fluctuations…”</p><p>“Not only that, before you die, if possible, have you all practiced switching wills?”</p><p>“It’s a form of training where the main body and the demi-saint’s incarnation undergo a transfer of will. Some demi-saints have strong spiritual wills and will naturally learn it after they undergo sanctification while others have to rely on practice…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
