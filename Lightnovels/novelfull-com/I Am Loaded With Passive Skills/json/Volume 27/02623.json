(3)</p><p>Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“What I said sounds very jumbled, right? Jin Ren sighed.</p><p>“No, I can actually understand what you mean.” After Cao Erzhu shook his head, he nodded again.</p><p>“I’m just thinking, why is it that not all good is good, and not all bad is bad? Whether it’s active or not, why does it always end up being passive?”</p><p>Mei Siren’s eyes became melancholic.</p><p>Er Zhu’s words always touched his heart. He wanted to say something but hesitated. In the end, he didn’t say anything.</p><p>He, Mei Siren, couldn’t give an answer.</p><p>“This is a ‘mistake’!”</p><p>In the empty silence, Jin Ren was suddenly thunderstruck. This made Cao Erzhu and Mei Siren look over in shock.</p><p>“Erzhu, don’t doubt yourself.”</p><p>“It’s not your father’s fault, it’s not Elder You Tu, it’s not the Holy Divine Palace’s fault, it’s not the Saint Servant’s fault, it’s not the First Pavilion in the Sky’s fault…”</p><p>“What is wrong is the current chaos itself, the ‘mistake’ itself. This is the result of the times and the overall situation.”</p><p>After a pause, Jin Ren felt that his thoughts had cleared up.</p><p>“Erzhu, you made me aware, you woke me up.”</p><p>“I once asked Bazhun’an a similar question and sought an answer from him. His answer was ‘freedom’.”</p><p>“At that time, I quite agreed with him. Now that I’ve experienced so much, I think that even the Saint Servant’s ideology is biased. This might be one of the reasons why Elder Sang and Bazhun’an parted ways.”</p><p>“In such a situation, only when the problem is solved at the root or from the vantage point can the chaos be eradicated.”</p><p>The night wind was slightly cold, and Mei Siren’s scalp was a little numb.</p><p>He understood what Xu Xiaoshou meant. The current situation was like a tree, the root doctor was the Saint Servant, and the vantage point doctor was the Holy Divine Palace. No matter which side won, the mistake would be resolved.</p><p>However, in this world, it was difficult to distinguish the true self. Both the root and vantage point doctors suffered, as well as everything parasitic that was on and under the tree.</p><p>The Saint war in the Shengshen Continent was still ongoing, and the storm raged on. This was the best explanation for this statement.</p><p>Cao Erzhu listened attentively. He did not know what his thoughts were about, nor did he know if he understood the deep meaning behind these words.</p><p>Jin Ren turned around and smiled at the old sword saint.</p><p>“Master Siren, I understand why the First Pavilion in the Sky exists.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“To end the mistakes and rewrite the future!”</p><p>Mei Siren almost could not believe what he just heard and felt a headache coming.</p><p>You’re going against the will of Heaven!</p><p>You are even more arrogant than Bazhun’an!</p><p>“What do you mean?” Cao Erzhu looked down.</p><p>Jin Ren laughed. “When a tree is already beyond cure, the best way is not to treat it from the top or from the bottom. It’s best to cut it down and plant another one. The soil is still fertile anyway.”</p><p>Cao Erzhu understood something and continued to ponder.</p><p>Mei Siren was amazed by Xu Xiaoshou’s arrogance and was even more worried about the future of the First Pavilion in the Sky. It was originally a random name and its meaning matched its name.</p><p>The moonlight was dazzling and the mountain wind blew gently across the plain.</p><p>Everything on Qingyuan Mountain was still the same, but it seemed to have changed. It seemed a little brighter.</p><p>After a long silence, Cao Erzhu laughed out loud. “Brother Shou, I know about Bazhun’an and the Saint Servant.”</p><p>“Your Eighth Uncle, you said it before.” Jin Ren was surprised, but there was a high chance that Kui Leihan had taken precautions and did not want Cao Erzhu to join the Saint Servant.</p><p>“They are the dark faction, but not all of them are bad, right?”</p><p>“Uh-huh.”</p><p>“There are the white-clothed people at the Holy Divine Palace, but I don’t like them. I won’t join them.”</p><p>” Why? Because of Elder Dao the Flamboyant?”</p><p>“Yes, Brother Shou. Father doesn’t allow me to mix around with a Divine Sorcerer. I can’t even get close.”</p><p>“Uh, your father is right…”</p><p>“Brother Shou, you’re a good person.” Cao Erzhu’s turning point was rapid. It was as if he snapped off a branch.</p><p>“Ah?” Jin Ren was stunned. “No, no!” He was stunned by the sudden good person card. Why did he suddenly do this? Was he playing with him?</p><p>“Brother Shou, are you also from the First Pavilion in the Sky?” Cao Erzhu’s words startled him.</p><p>Who said Er Zhu was not smart?</p><p>Jin Ren was shocked. He was surprised that Er Zhu could analyze this.</p><p>“No!” His objection was vehement. “I am not from the First Pavilion in the Sky.”</p><p>“Eh?” Cao Erzhu was originally a little smug, but now he felt like he had hit rock bottom. “I was wrong?”</p><p>“Actually, you’re not wrong. It’s just that it is a mess. The priorities are messy at the moment…” Jin Ren smiled and said lightly.</p><p>“The First Pavilion in the Sky belongs to me.”</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s heart shook. What he saw was an array wheel head, and what he felt was an incomparably huge force.</p><p>His mouth was agape and he looked at the old immortal Mei in disbelief.</p><p>Mei Siren smiled and nodded as he folded his fan.</p><p>“It’s his.”</p><p>At this moment, Cao Erzhu finally understood.</p><p>Why Brother Shou’s definition of the First Pavilion in the Sky was so direct and decisive, as if he was the owner…</p><p>So, there was no ‘as if’!</p><p>He could really make the decision!</p><p>“End the mistakes, rewrite the future…”</p><p>This was an incomparably grand dream.</p><p>It was also the first light that Cao Erzhu, who had just stepped into the world and was like a frightened rabbit, could see in the night sky of Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>He could say these very powerful words. ‘Are kings, princes, generals, etc…</p><p>Beside him was also a highly respected person like the old immortal. His father said that birds of a feather flock together…</p><p>He was sincere and treated him well and even planned his future for him. He was also the first person to take the initiative to be his friend. There had never been such a person before…</p><p>He didn’t even say anything weird like Lord Li; he only gave him some advice. Nor was he like that Yu Zhiwen, who tried to deceive him with the ‘Yu Xingxing’ trick. He treated people with sincerity…</p><p>When the sky turned white, the moon could no longer cover the stars. The night was gone, snow and dew were everywhere, and a new day had started at Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>“Father, I have to make a bold decision!”</p><p>“I will choose for myself!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s gaze became extremely firm, and he clenched his fists tightly.</p><p>This meant that he no longer gave himself a way out. He wanted to be independent and become a real man!</p><p>“Brother Shou…”</p><p>“Cao Erzhu…”</p><p>When he spoke out, the array wheel head also spoke at the same time. The timing was just perfect.</p><p>“You go first.” Cao Erzhu hurriedly extended his hand.</p><p>“Uh, you go first…”</p><p>“No, no, Brother Shou should speak first!” Cao Erzhu unclenched his fists. Yes, he was a person whose determination could be interrupted by an accident. He did not dare to persist.</p><p>“Why don’t we say it together?” Jin Ren suggested.</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s expression froze, then he quickly laughed out loud.</p><p>Brother Shou was always like this, very much to his taste. The suggestions he made were unexpected, but they were also very fun. Erzhu liked them very much.</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>He didn’t even count.</p><p>There was no eye contact.</p><p>They didn’t linger and deliberately waited.</p><p>Amid the snowstorm, when Cao Erzhu suddenly opened his mouth, Jin Ren said in unison.</p><p>“Can I join the First Pavilion in the Sky?”</p><p>“Are you willing to join the First Pavilion in the Sky?”</p><p>These two sentences were as if they spoke in unison, but when they fell, Cao Erzhu and the head of the array wheel burst out in laughter.</p><p>The two of them were like two big children as they laughed and suddenly squatted down in the snow.</p><p>One clapped and the other patted the array wheel’s head…</p><p>They continued to laugh out loud and were obviously overjoyed.</p><p>“Aren’t they just like children?”</p><p>Mei Siren grabbed his paper fan and smiled as he watched this scene. As he watched the wind and snow, his thoughts drifted away with the wind…</p><p>Heroes cherish each other, the young and frivolous.</p><p>How similar was this?</p><p>How wonderful!</p><p>Was this the benefit of living a long life?</p><p>There were sighs, nostalgia, and envy in his eyes…</p><p>He seemed to have seen the two young men in the snowstorm back then. They were untamed and arrogant.</p><p>The scene shattered, and the laughter faded away.</p><p>He seemed to be out of touch with the world.</p><p>When his gaze finally landed on the purple-red color of the Taicheng Sword, Mei Siren’s fingers gently brushed the sword body and he appeared stunned.</p><p>The wind and snow only added to the gloom.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
