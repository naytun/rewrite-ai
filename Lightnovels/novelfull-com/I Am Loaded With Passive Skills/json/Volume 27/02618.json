In the end, he locked onto the pile of the remains of the Divine Puppet that had a trace of spiritual senses.</p><p>It was very familiar and it belonged to Xiaoshou.</p><p>However, was there a possibility that the Divine Puppet was part of Dao Qiongcang’s evil scheme?</p><p>“Which demon are you that dared to poison a person’s heart? Hurry up and show yourself! Mei Siren raised his Taicheng Sword and his murderous intent overflowed.</p><p>“Teacher, don’t you recognize me?” Jin Ren trembled.</p><p>At a certain moment, Jin Ren really thought that he was an independent entity. His spiritual senses were actually very different from the original body.</p><p>After Mei Siren recovered from his shock, he descended in joy and bent down beside the remains of the Divine Puppet.</p><p>“How can you confirm that you are truly Xu Xiaoshou?” He asked hesitantly.</p><p>“You Tu took a hit from my sword?”</p><p>At that moment, the old sword saint’s hand that held the Taicheng Sword trembled, and his expression changed drastically.</p><p>He glanced at Cao Erzhu in panic and quickly looked away. He took a deep breath to calm himself and shouted.</p><p>“That’s totally false. Don’t talk nonsense, kid!”</p><p>“Oh, are you sure?”</p><p>“Yes, I’m sure…” Mei Siren hurriedly changed the topic. “How did you end up like this?”</p><p>“Ah! Teacher, Ah!” All of a sudden, Jin Ren burst into tears. “Elder Dao the Flamboyant bullied me…”</p><p>“Don’t cry, don’t cry, Master is here.” Mei Siren’s heart ached. He picked up the pile of the remains of the Divine Puppet very carefully in case he broke some parts.</p><p>But even though he was so careful, some parts still fell out of the pile of scrap metal with a clang.</p><p>Mei Siren panicked.</p><p>He was not a Divine Sorcerer, so he didn’t know what part was important.</p><p>He also didn’t know if the copper-like thing that dropped out would affect Xu Xiaoshou’s current state.</p><p>“You, you, you…”</p><p>“It’s fine, Teacher. You can just pull out the head of the array wheel and keep it safe.”</p><p>“That’s all?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Mei Siren was very decisive. He slashed out with his Taicheng Sword and immediately cut off the precious head of the array wheel.</p><p>At this point, Jin Ren felt totally at ease.</p><p>This array wheel that contained all the data of the Divine Oracle was in an impenetrable fortress when it was in Master Siren’s hands.</p><p>At this moment, Cao Erzhu, who had blown up Dao Qiongcang’s head in his first battle, fell from the sky.</p><p>He withdrew his God Punishment Tribulation and looked hesitantly at the head of the array wheel in the old immortal’s hand. He asked in a strangely familiar tone.</p><p>“You are Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Jin Ren was slightly surprised. His ‘Lord Shou’ name had already spread to a small place like Qingyuan Mountain, and even this guy knows me?</p><p>“I did not change my name. I’m Xu Xiaoshou!” He openly established his identity. With Master Siren around, he was not afraid of anything.</p><p>Cao Erzhu rubbed his hands and scratched his head in embarrassment. “My name is Cao Erzhu. Thank you very much. You helped me vent my anger just now…”</p><p>Hmm?</p><p>Why did these words sound a little strange?</p><p>“It’s nothing. No need to mention.” Jin Ren quickly brushed this matter aside. “Do you know me?”</p><p>“Yes, Sister August left a note. You should know her.” Cao Erzhu carefully took out a piece of paper from his ring.</p><p>When he flipped the paper over, on it were the words, ‘Xu Xiaoshou’ written in an elegant script.</p><p>“August…”</p><p>Jin Ren frowned and thought about it carefully, but he didn’t know this person.</p><p>He had never even heard of this name before, let alone seen it.</p><p>However, his name was indeed written on that piece of paper. Perhaps the other party knew him. After all, who in the world did not know the name ‘Lord Shou’?</p><p>“I don’t know this ‘August’ you’re talking about.”</p><p>“If you have more information, such as why she left this name, or what message she asked you to send me…”</p><p>After a pause, he saw that there was no reaction from Cao Erzhu; he only looked very politely at the head of the array wheel. Jin Ren carefully considered his words and said, “Maybe I can help you with something?”</p><p>“There isn’t.” After Cao Erzhu listened intently, he waved his hand. “She only left this name. I don’t know if she wanted me to wait…”</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>This was the first time they met, and Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even know who Sister August was. Wasn’t it inappropriate for him to say that he was waiting for him?</p><p>Cao Erzhu was not brainless. He felt that if he spoke like this, he would seem like a weirdo.</p><p>Suddenly, he felt a sense of loss as if all the clues had gone missing.</p><p>“No more.”</p><p>Cao Erzhu waved his hand again and took a step back. He was slightly disappointed. “Since you don’t know Sister August, then perhaps I’m thinking too much.”</p><p>You’re a strange fellow.</p><p>Jin Ren wanted to say something.</p><p>When he saw the big guy’s wary expression and how he took a step back to maintain a safe distance, he stopped talking.</p><p>At this moment, the discomfort of silence would most likely make those who were even more at a loss choose to speak.</p><p>If he could reveal more, the information would be more complete, and Jin Ren would have a better grasp of the situation.</p><p>Cao Erzhu opened his mouth. Indeed, he could not adapt to the awkwardness of this silence. He wanted to say something, but he could not.</p><p>“August, was she the student who followed the bad-tempered old man you mentioned?” Mei Siren interrupted.</p><p>I didn’t say that he had a bad temper. The old man had a very good temperament…Cao Erzhu turned around and looked slightly stunned. He quickly nodded. “Yes, the old immortal.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
