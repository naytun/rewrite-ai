This power could form mountains, and oceans, and transform into anything!</p><p>The old deity in the fan was merely trapped in his chamber, willingly turning away, thus unable to see the scenery outside the schoolhouse.</p><p>Cao Erzhu stared for a long while, somewhat lost in a daze. After a while, scratching his head, he asked, “Old deity, do you ever feel lost?”</p><p>Mei Siren’s eyes flickered in surprise, glancing curiously at the big child.</p><p>He lowered his eyes in thought for a while, then looked up at Qingyuan Mountain and the night sky, murmuring somewhat puzzledly:</p><p>“Yes, suddenly I can’t see the road ahead.”</p><p>“Because I am not truly an old deity. Among my disciples, there is one who has become a great deity.”</p><p>Cao Erzhu tilted his head in contemplation, pointing behind the old deity.</p><p>“They will help you.”</p><p>Mei Siren was momentarily stunned, turning to look behind him, only to find there was nothing but a small donkey.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Mei Siren burst out laughing.</p><p>He glanced at Cao Erzhu, then turned the fan over, repeatedly scrutinizing the self-portrait on it. He continued to laugh, gradually releasing his worries.</p><p>The laughter echoed melodiously through the forest below the mountain.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>After a while, Mei Siren finally stopped laughing. He reached out to pat the boy’s head but ended up patting his arm twice instead.</p><p>“Come with me up the mountain. I’ll help you find the one who killed your father.”</p><p>“Be careful, Qingyuan Mountain is very dangerous tonight. You must not stray far from me until I say so, then you can leave.”</p><p>“Alright.” Cao Erzhu nodded as if his father had come alive again, finding a renewed sense of purpose.</p><p>Mei Siren didn’t bring the small donkey into the mountain, taking only Cao Erzhu.</p><p>As he slashed with his fan, a green Mo Sword emerged, cutting through the great array of Qingyuan Mountain as they made their way through it.</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s eyes lit up. Mo Sword Technique!</p><p>Mei Siren asked as they walked, “Have you studied swordsmanship?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>“Is it Ancient Sword Technique?”</p><p>“Yes, they said it was.”</p><p>“Have you met an old man who also looked like a deity, but less charismatic than me, and who taught you swordsmanship?”</p><p>“Um…” Cao Erzhu hesitated, then nodded vigorously. “Yes!”</p><p>“Do you know the old man?” Cao Erzhu asked in return.</p><p>Mei Siren smiled without saying a word, feeling quite content, even the night scenery in the mountains seemed a bit more beautiful.</p><p>He pulled out a sword case, handing it to Cao Erzhu, but it remained unresponsive.</p><p>Cao Erzhu opened the sword case to find a three-foot sword of purplish-red, exceptionally splendid, and unique.</p><p>He took out the sword and examined it closely.</p><p>This time, the three-foot sword reacted, trembling slightly not in resistance but in excitement.</p><p>This sword was sharp, its murderous intent palpable, quite different from the old deity’s aura… Cao Erzhu asked:</p><p>“Whose sword is this?”</p><p>Mei Siren stroked his beard, looked up, and laughed heartily:</p><p>“This is his sword.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
