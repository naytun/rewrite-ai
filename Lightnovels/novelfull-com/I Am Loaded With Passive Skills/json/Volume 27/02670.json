They might even be killed!</p><p>At this moment of ridicule, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man saw that Xu Xiaoshou had disappeared.</p><p>“What a joke!”</p><p>Under his mask, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and his figure immediately vanished.</p><p>The Saint Beast of the Xu Yue Grey Palace, Greedy the Cat Spirit, was out of control. No matter how strong Xu Xiaoshou was, he had not reached the demi-saint realm. Even if he transformed into an Ultimate Giant…</p><p>There was no killing intent!</p><p>Did he think that he couldn’t feed Greedy the Cat Spirit?</p><p>In the spatial fragment, the Greedy the Cat Spirit traveled at high speed toward the place where the blood and food were concentrated.</p><p>Suddenly, a familiar figure appeared before its scarlet eyes.</p><p>This made Greedy the Cat Spirit stop in its tracks.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>The second true body didn’t protect itself at all. It raised one hand and stopped Greedy the Cat Spirit from advancing.</p><p>Back in the Apricot Realm, Greedy the Cat Spirit had listened to his orders and eaten up Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>This meant that it was still rational and controllable!</p><p>In this world, the only person who could make it stop was probably him, who had nurtured it for so long!</p><p>There was no sound from the spatial fragment. There were only the space blades and storms that moved about randomly.</p><p>It only stopped for a moment.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit opened its mouth and roared; the blood stained food in front of it was blasted into the spatial fragment.</p><p>The sharp claws that slashed out were so fast that even the second true body couldn’t react in time.</p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>At this critical moment, a decaying aura appeared in front of him and condensed into the figure of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man</p><p>He lightly shoved his palm out and collided with the sharp claws of the Greedy the Cat Spirit.</p><p>“Whoa…”</p><p>The airflow spread.</p><p>The sand and snow on the long street shifted slightly, and the shadow of the golden osmanthus tree on the street shook.</p><p>There were no strange noises that issued forth as the power of Greedy the Cat Spirit seemed to have been completely digested by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>One man and one beast, one small and one big, one palm and one claw.</p><p>Under the signboard at the gate of the Southern Zone of Jade Capital City, the confrontation lasted for half a breath, and no damage was done.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s second true body, that had been enveloped by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, was stunned.</p><p>When the Body of Devour clashed, the damage was equal to zero after they canceled each other out?</p><p>Weng!</p><p>At this moment, the Greedy the Cat Spirit looked up at Jade Capital City, the perfect city that had the blood and food, with its scarlet eyes. There was a spatial fluctuation under its feet.</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian who had come from afar, was dumbfounded. “How can it teleport?”</p><p>Before everyone could react, and before Greedy the Cat Spirit could complete the teleportation and enter the place where it could eat freely…</p><p>“Woo!”</p><p>Above the Nine Heavens, a symphony of countless howls of ghost beasts suddenly sounded and converged into dark clouds that covered the sky.</p><p>A huge blood shadow copper coin was thrown from the distance. It was solid on the outside and empty on the inside. It was round on the outside and square on the inside. It expanded and encircled the huge ghost beast Greedy the Cat Spirit, then shrunk and wrapped itself tightly around it.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit thrashed about and swept its nine tails around wildly as it struggled desperately.</p><p>The killing intent was piercingly cold, and one of the red-clothed people descended from the sky. It was an old man with white hair.</p><p>He stepped on the head of the crazed ghost beast and controlled the huge blood shadow copper coin with both hands. He swept his gaze down and said.</p><p>“It is indeed the Saint beast of the Xu Yue Grey Palace. It is the Body of Devour…”</p><p>“Elder Yu’s sacred physique is about to be released. Elder Zhong, hold the fort. Contact Hallmaster Xuanji.”</p><p>“Gather the red-clothed people to set up the array. We can just fly far away and not get close. We can also garner the power of the capital’s great array to help me.”</p><p>After he said that, this old man from the red-clothed people looked around at the unfamiliar, kind-hearted, and inexperienced ghost beast captors. He said solemnly.</p><p>“This place is extremely dangerous. Those who are not involved, leave immediately.”</p><p>“Leave this ghost beast to me!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
