It actually expanded at such a rapid rate that it was now more than three times its original size.</p><p>At this moment, the Southern Zone gate was covered in a mass of ghostly energy that blocked out the sunlight.</p><p>Just a mere swipe from its nine fluffy tails was enough to turn the roads and forests into dust.</p><p>The spectators were all shocked.</p><p>This ghost beast was one of the most violent creature they had ever seen.</p><p>The Blood Shadow copper coin that restrained Greedy the Cat Spirit’s body couldn’t keep up with the sudden expansion of its body and bounced off with a bang.</p><p>“Long!”</p><p>The Blood Shadow copper coin flew into the sky after it exploded.</p><p>Fang Wenxin, the old man from the red-clothed people could not restrain the resonance. He was not able to suppress Greedy the Cat Spirit as he let out a muffled groan and blood seeped out from the corners of his lips.</p><p>He was very experienced, so he quickly dispersed the blood and the smell of blood. After he got up, he shouted again,</p><p>“Everyone, stay away!”</p><p>Mei, Ye, Yu, Zhong, and the others quickly retreated.</p><p>Even the spectators who had been teleported in advance to the distant forest took a few steps back.</p><p>This distance should be enough, right?</p><p>Fang Wenxin stared at Greedy the Cat Spirit who had started to mutate again.</p><p>At this moment, it was useless to blame Zhong Yuanzi’s small class.</p><p>Moreover, the weird situation that no one noticed just now came from the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and the Blood World Pearl.</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi was not solely in the wrong. Fang Wenxin and Elder Yu were also at fault.</p><p>The most important thing now was to figure out why Greedy the Cat Spirit went berserk again…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Nine Heavens suddenly shook with thunder strikes.</p><p>Dark clouds quickly gathered. It was actually…</p><p>“Tribulation?”</p><p>Fang Wenxin was stunned.</p><p>It had only eaten Xu Xiaoshou, but the ghost beast Greedy the Cat Spirit had been filled with so much energy that it was on the point of eruption. Was Xu Xiaoshou some sort of Holy Medicine?</p><p>Even the Holy Medicine could not replenish it to such a point!</p><p>Also, was this the Nine Death Thunder Calamity, or…</p><p>“Long!”</p><p>The dark clouds in the sky quickly split into two layers. The lower layer looked gloomy and desolate, and the upper layer was wild and tumultuous. One layer was filled with tribulation intent, and the other layer was filled with Holy Energy.</p><p>Elder Yu, who had jumped onto the wall of the Southern Zone, looked up in surprise.</p><p>“Dual Tribulations?”</p><p>When they heard this, the four Saints Fang, Zhong, Mei and Ye looked back in shock.</p><p>Nine Death Thunder Calamity and the saint calamity?</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>“No, it’s not impossible!”</p><p>Fang Wenxin quickly recalled something and said seriously.</p><p>“There was a time when Elder Yu slept in the deep sea; he swallowed everything that existed and kept it hidden in his body. He did not remember it for years.”</p><p>“When the wind and clouds changed and rose from the sea and turned into a roc, the two tribulations will come at the same time. The Holy Power is like a surging sea, and the world is as vast as a basin…”</p><p>He did not continue.</p><p>Because according to the definition of the Holy Divine Palace, this was also a type of ghostly energy.</p><p>At that time, a young Fang Wenxin had rushed over with his team. The people in the secret realm of the cold palace had all been taken by surprise, but it was already too late.</p><p>Kun Peng’s path to sanctification was unstoppable!</p><p>An ordinary demi-saint would fall at the mere touch from such a huge body.</p><p>The reason why his team and the Holy Emperor’s aristocratic family were still alive was because the Kun Peng didn’t go on a killing spree after it underwent its sanctification.</p><p>It was like an ignorant and intelligent creature that had just been born. When it saw a fish, it turned into a ‘kun’, when it saw a cloud, it turned into a ‘peng’, and when it saw a human, it turned into a human.</p><p>It showed that it could be communicated with and allowed itself to be guided.</p><p>After a series of attempts, Fang Wenxin brought it back to the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, and it later became the current Kun Peng God.</p><p>Elder Yu’s memory seemed to have been triggered as well. He stared blankly at the ghost beast Greedy the Cat Spirit that covered the sky and muttered to himself,</p><p>“It should have eaten a lot of good things…”</p><p>The Kun Peng formed its own world inside its body and it had to consume a large number of heavenly and earthly treasures before it could ride the wind and go out to sea.</p><p>The energy that had settled down in the past had to be fed back when needed to form the terrifying phenomenon of the double tribulations.</p><p>Compared to Elder Yu’s actual age, the ghost beast Greedy the Cat Spirit was too young!</p><p>The only reason it could still withstand the double tribulations was that during its short life, it had eaten higher quality natural treasures than the ones that the Kun Peng had subconsciously eaten when it was asleep!</p><p>“Ha…”</p><p>The Five Decays of Man who remained hidden in the Holy Path swallowed his own aura. He withdrew the Blood World Pearl that he had vigorously activated when he saw this and left it to the influence of nature.</p><p>How could Greedy the Cat Spirit not have eaten so much and how could the quality not be high?</p><p>Back then, at Qingyuan Mountain, when Yu Zhiwen constructed the spatial passageway.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man only took one look at the ghost beast aura in Xu Xiaosu’s small world and declined to enter.</p><p>Why?</p><p>He had done too much research on the ghost beast!</p><p>He could tell that Greedy the Cat Spirit had been aroused by the blood and food, just like how the Kun Peng had undergone sanctification.</p><p>Let alone the two Saints Mei and Ye, even if there were a few demi- saints, they might not be enough to defeat the other party.</p><p>After all, there was a Herb Garden of Divine Farmer in Xu Xiaoshou’s small world.</p><p>Since Greedy the Cat Spirit went berserk, would it be rational enough to let go of those ancient Holy Medicine?</p><p>Impossible!</p><p>Since that was the case, it had eaten all the herbs in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer. One herb could provide the Sovereign Stage with Holy Power, and ten herbs could enable the virtual image of The Divine to beat up Bei Huai’s incarnation.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man silently retreated.</p><p>He knew only too well how terrifying a completely liberated Body of Devour was.</p><p>Not only would Xu Xiaoshou’s small world not be able to suppress it, but it would also take the initiative to come out to hunt for food. Moreover, after it came out, its combat strength would continue to soar.</p><p>The growth period of a ghost beast was not long to begin with. If the Body of Devour was compressed this time and combined with the entire Herb Garden of Divine Farmer…</p><p>Sanctification was considered good.</p><p>Even to the Holy Emperor level, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man felt that it was possible.</p><p>After the Body of Devour completely absorbed and digested the energy, it was the first of the Five Extreme Physiques that the Divine Oracle had to release and eliminate the moment it sensed it!</p><p>The key question now was…</p><p>Did Greedy the Cat Spirit have a semi-saint person or a Holy Emperor person or a substitute of the same level, and which one would it use?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
