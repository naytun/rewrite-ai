It had taken them hundreds of years to produce a Xiang Yaoyao. She did not attract much attention among the the</p><p>Ten High Nobles, so she would not bring any great disaster to the Xiang family.</p><p>However, they had raised many higher voids as external armed forces and had made friends with many large factions and associations. They themselves were mainly engaged in trading and had dealings with the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>Their economic strength did not differ too much from the Plenty Gold Company. They were ranked in the top ten in the mainland, and their influence in the Jade Capital City was even more terrifying.</p><p>Before Xiang Yaoyao became one of the Ten High Nobles, she used her own methods to take over the Yougui Pavilion from her family.</p><p>This powerful money making machine later contributed most of the huge amount of resources that The Divine needed to cultivate ancient martial arts.</p><p>The return on the investment could only be described as ‘terrifying’!</p><p>The Ghost God gang was one of them.</p><p>It was established when The Divine and a group of brothers who had fought against the world in the past came together. It became the towering tree behind Aunt Xiang, the Yougui Pavilion, and even the Xiang family.</p><p>Even if the boss of the Ghost God gang, The Divine, did not appear for decades, as long as there was no news of his death, the Xiang family would be able to enjoy everlasting peace.</p><p>Aunt Xiang did not do much in her life.</p><p>She seized the Yougui Pavilion and became the top star of the Exotic Pavilion.</p><p>When she became one of the the Ten High Nobles, it meant that her combat strength was despised by others.</p><p>Accompanied by The Divine, she became the pendant of a Big Boss.</p><p>At this point, there was nothing left to show and nothing worthy of praise.</p><p>She was like a lucky flower vase. She relied on her good looks and figure and soared all the way to the top. She always made good choices at the right time and came up with answers that did not receive full marks but were much higher than the passing line.</p><p>Over time, this luck accumulated, and an ordinary person like her became the victorious owner. Countless women in the world admired and envied her. After Xu Xiaoshou heard this, he felt that this aunt was not a simple person!</p><p>A full score was something that even geniuses knew.</p><p>Controlling points was a test of one’s strength.</p><p>If you wanted to be sharp, you had to be as sharp as Bazhun’an. When others racked their brains to solve the questions, he had already drawn his sword and killed all the examinees in the same examination hall. Then, he used the Three Seals to force the examiner to keep his mouth shut. He would then be the one and only contestant with full marks.</p><p>If he couldn’t do it, he had to be as sharp as Yan Wuse. Only when he died did he realize that it was difficult to be muddle-headed.</p><p>And for someone to be able to take over the Yougui Pavilion at such a young age, how could she not be astute?</p><p>She must have sensed something in advance and made an excuse to leave first. When she returned to the examination hall, she found that there were no traces of the killer, but there were bloody corpses all around. Therefore, she calmly picked up the answer sheet that had been cut to four-fifths by the sword and filled it up.</p><p>Of course, she wouldn’t be first.</p><p>Even if all the answers were correct, it would only be good. It could not be considered as outstanding and would not steal the limelight.</p><p>However, there would always be other first places in other examination halls. She did not need to be first. Why not fulfill another first place?</p><p>“If The Divine’s brain is on the same level as his brothers in the Ghost God gang, then the reason why he had not been played to death yet was not due to his strength, but because he has this woman who backed him up…”</p><p>Of course, these were just Xu Xiaoshou’s guesses.</p><p>He still needed to meet her to find out what she was like. In short, he just needed to be vigilant.</p><p>The Yougui Pavilion was really opulent!</p><p>As he stepped into the third level, he actually entered an extradimensional space.</p><p>With Xu Xiaoshou’s current spatial comprehension, he could easily tell that this was a small world created by humans.</p><p>However, he could breathe freely in it without any discomfort. It was obvious that it was connected to the rules of the Shengshen Continent and could be used for human daily life.</p><p>Other than the fact that it wasn’t very sturdy and couldn’t withstand the impact of a cauldron explosion, the third level of the Yougui Pavilion was like a weakened version of the Yuan Mansion. There were basically no flaws.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, we’re here.”</p><p>Miss Ah Yao clearly did not know that the person who stood in front of her was a hardcore who could even scheme against the Divine Oracle. On their way upstairs, she would have already divulged all the information he wanted.</p><p>After she released the sickly young master’s hand, she felt the effects of the alcohol. She sweated profusely and was physically and mentally exhausted, but she was finally relieved.</p><p>“Thank you. Aren’t we going in together?”</p><p>The sickly young master raised his eyes and looked at the wooden door in front of him that emitted such a light and elegant fragrance. He wondered if he should enter or not.</p><p>A honey trap?</p><p>Would there be a half-naked beauty on the bed after he entered, and then three to five burly men would jump out the moment the door closed. After which Dao Qiongcang would appear with a smirk and suppress him?</p><p>Then, he could bypass all the procedures in the Central Region and meet Elder Sang happily.</p><p>Miss Ah Yao’s steps faltered. “If Aunt Xiang did not give any order. I would not dare to enter.”</p><p>She bowed and knocked on the wooden door. “Please, Young Master.” The sickly young master smiled indifferently.</p><p>There would always be solutions to problems. If Bazhun’an could trap him, could they really bury him?</p><p>“Thank you for your hard work. You can leave.”</p><p>He closed the paper fan and casually threw out a small black bag embroidered with cloud patterns. The sickly young master pushed open the door and was about to enter.</p><p>Miss Ah Yao subconsciously reached out to catch the black bag that flew over and almost dropped her pipa.</p><p>The black bag was in her hand, and there was a clinking sound that came from it.</p><p>Miss Ah Yao was instantly stunned. Soon, a look of humiliation flashed across her face.</p><p>“What did Young Master mean by this?”</p><p>“This is for you.”</p><p>“Reward…”</p><p>Miss Ah Yao’s cherry lips quivered. She looked at the back view that did not even turn around and her mind was a total blank.</p><p>She subconsciously opened the black bag and poured out seven Spiritual Crystals.</p><p>Spirit, Spirit Crystals?</p><p>Seven, seven?</p><p>The sound when she dropped to the ground was as if her dignity had been crushed to the ground and trampled on seven times..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
