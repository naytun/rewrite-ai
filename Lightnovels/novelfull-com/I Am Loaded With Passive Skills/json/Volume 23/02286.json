She cried out in panic and fear.</p><p>“Idiot, save me!”</p><p>Hey, who’s the idiot?</p><p>Kong Yuhen was stunned.</p><p>The second true body was also stunned.</p><p>Before the two could react, the acupuncture points on the bald virtual image lit up like a star map and glowed with dazzling light.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>The bald virtual image broke away from Aunt Xiang!</p><p>The virtual image could only follow its owner’s actions or strengthen its spiritual technique.</p><p>Aunt Xiang’s virtual image was just like the summoning spell. It summoned a wild beast that could act on its own.</p><p>He charged forward with extreme force and lunged toward Kong Yuhen’s chest. At the same time, the muscles on his right arm bulged, and his millstone-sized fist turned into an afterimage and flew away. A simple and unadorned uppercut smashed into the jade-faced scholar’s chin.</p><p>Kong Yuhen’s pupils suddenly lost focus.</p><p>He wasn’t a good fighter. He was the type who would speak out instead. If there was anything he didn’t understand or if there were any unclear grudges, he would explain himself to everyone. He subconsciously opened his mouth and said.</p><p>“Friend… ”</p><p>Time slowed down at this moment.</p><p>As he spoke, the distance between the bald virtual image’s uppercut and the jade-faced scholar’s chin seemed to have been stretched infinitely.</p><p>Aunt Xiang’s heart clenched. Her fingernails dug into her palms without her being aware of it.</p><p>As soon as he spoke, the second true body’s heart suddenly stopped, and it was as if its power had been plundered.</p><p>“Human Realm Dao!”</p><p>The bald virtual image that was already extremely solid could still speak. Its voice rumbled across like thunder and resounded clearly.</p><p>At the same time, with his Perception, he saw that everyone within a five-kilometer radius of the Jade Capital City had the same reaction. They trembled in unison and held their throbbing chests, and almost fell to the ground.</p><p>Their strength seemed to have been taken away by the unknown!</p><p>Meanwhile, in the Yougui Pavilion, the star map that covered the body of the bald virtual image had disappeared.</p><p>His physical body was no longer in an ethereal state. After he absorbed the power of the mortal world, he materialized into a physical body that covered all the light on his body.</p><p>His expression became extremely lively and vibrant. At this moment, his eyes were so clear that they reflected the shocked face of the jade-faced scholar. “Wait…” The Power Upanishad Formation beneath Kong Yuhen’s feet hadn’t even appeared yet.</p><p>“Shut up and die.”</p><p>With a boom, the restriction of space and the delay of time were forcefully broken through by this simple and unadorned punch that had been strengthened in a special way.</p><p>The bald virtual image’s voice stopped, and the uppercut landed heavily on the jade-faced scholar’s chin.</p><p>“Crack! ”</p><p>The second true body could clearly hear the sound of bones cracking.</p><p>The image transmitted through his Perception was none other than that of Kong Yuhen, who looked like such a tall and handsome person on Abyss Island.</p><p>After a punch…</p><p>His face was contorted, and his facial features were distorted as his entire body almost collapsed. However, under the powerful restriction of space, his entire body did not fall apart but still stood in place due to the force.</p><p>At this moment, his Spatial Upanishad could only be used to protect himself, to maintain the last bit of his dignity, and to prevent his body from exploding.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A huge fist-shaped hole appeared on the top of the Yougui Pavilion.</p><p>Kong Yuhen was sent flying into the sky with a single punch. It was as if a human fireworks had exploded in the sky above the Jade Capital City and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>It was as if he had never appeared in such a sorry state before, and he could start all over again.</p><p>“+(Startled, Passive Points,+)+l.”</p><p>In the Apricot Realm, Xu Xiaoshou’s legs went weak as he watched from a world away.</p><p>Merely one punch, and Kong Yuhen was sent flying?</p><p>His Spatial Upanishad didn’t work, and his time delay had shattered.</p><p>How much force was contained in this punch?</p><p>What was that ‘Human Realm Dao’?</p><p>Who was that idiot? When he recalled the question that had frightened him and caused Kong Yuhen to leave the battlefield, Xu Xiaoshou was suddenly awakened.</p><p>The fool is actually me!</p><p>There could only be one answer for the virtual image that Aunt Xiang had summoned; it was The Divine, who was the Godhood called a god at the gates of hell!</p><p>In the private room, the bald man, The Divine, had also shed his human form and turned into a virtual image, but it was still not an illusion.</p><p>He turned around and scratched the back of his head in confusion. He looked at the big hole at the top of the Yougui pavilion.</p><p>“Xiang’er, who was he?”</p><p>Aunt Xiang’s tears fell like pearls. She pounced over and hung on The Divine’s body as if she wanted to melt into his body.</p><p>“He scared me to death, wuwuwu…”</p><p>“Baby, don’t cry. I’m here.” The Divine patted Aunt Xiang’s back and still looked confused. “But he didn’t seem to display any hostility towards you, so I held back. ”</p><p>“Sob, sob, sob, he’s Kong Yuhen. He definitely is! I won’t forget it!”</p><p>“Kong Yuhen? Who was that? I think I know him?”</p><p>“You don’t know him? How can you not know him?” Aunt Xiang raised her head with tears in her eyes. She clenched her fists and gently hammered the dumb man’s chest. She said angrily, “He killed me once, and you saved me. Don’t you remember who he was?!”</p><p>The Divine seemed to recall something, but at the same time, he didn’t seem to remember anything.</p><p>In fact, just like how Xiang Yaoyao did not make any impression on Kong Yuhen, he had also forgotten who such a weak opponent was, whether it was active or passive.</p><p>However, none of this mattered. The Divine quickly grabbed Aunt Xiang’s soft and limp hands. When he noticed the blood on her palms, his eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>He hurt you?”</p><p>“Yes, I almost died….’</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
