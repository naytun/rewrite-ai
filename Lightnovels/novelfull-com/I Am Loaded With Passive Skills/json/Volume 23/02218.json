(2)</h1><p>Chapter 2218: Call Me If There’s Anything, Eldest Senior Brother! (2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio     Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Staying here for three to five days, conversing freely with the teacher, achieving a broadened state of mind, and possibly attaining sanctification on the spot, all seemed within the realm of possibility!</p><p>However, at this moment, he was no longer a child; he had become the elder.</p><p>Personal emotions, compared to the lives of thousands of ancient swordsmen in the family, were insignificant.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong paused for a moment, then said, “Teacher, I must leave now!”</p><p>His words were decisive, indicating that he had already made a choice.</p><p>Bazhun’an nodded, “Go.”</p><p>“Teacher, take care.”</p><p>With a few words, as they looked at each other in silence, Xiao Kongtong respectfully clasped his fists and was about to leave.</p><p>Everyone now realized the weight on Xiao Kongtong’s shoulders. The First Pavilion in the Sky was currently just an empty shell, and its discovery wouldn’t cause significant harm.</p><p>The Water Ghost’s Night Cat, though rooted in Dongtianwang City for decades, operated with discretion.</p><p>They established a small intelligence organization, avoiding involvement in major affairs. Their influence was limited to Dongtianwang City.</p><p>For the Holy Divine Palace, the Water Ghost’s Night Cat was inconsequential; the power of a branch could handle it.</p><p>However, freeing up resources to deal with it was troublesome. After all, uprooting an intelligence organization requires extensive effort.</p><p>Considerations had to be made regarding whether it was worth the manpower and resources, and if it was economically viable.</p><p>After all, the Night Cat’s existence could bring significant benefits to the Holy Divine Palace’s Dongtianwang City branch.</p><p>Fringe Moon Immortal City was different!</p><p>Its system was too vast!</p><p>Once the situation on Abyss Island spread, a wave of Bazhun’an’s command and Fringe Moon Immortal City would directly turn against them, leading to chaos.</p><p>It was classified as a dark force, and its influence on the Shengshen Continent was substantial.</p><p>However, it had to be redefined…</p><p>Most of the people present were not fools.</p><p>Bazhun’an casually said, “Go,” but as they reflected, a chill ran down their spines.</p><p>With this mood, looking at Xiao Kongtong’s departing figure, one could sense the tragic determination of this Eldest Senior Brother of Fringe Moon Immortal City.</p><p>“Is that all Bazhun’an has to say? No further words? He is his teacher!”</p><p>Zhu Yike, watching his comrade leave, looked back at Bazhun’an. He couldn’t discern any extra emotions on his face.</p><p>For no apparent reason, a hint of anger arose in his heart, but it was quickly suppressed, and he dared not speak out.</p><p>Why was he angry?</p><p>What right did he have to be angry?</p><p>Bazhun’an, who stood one foot higher than the sky…</p><p>This statement implied not only strength but his cold and indifferent nature…</p><p>Zhu Yike looked around and saw that most people had reactions similar to his own.</p><p>Lei Xi’er, Mei Siren, and others, all seemed to exhibit slightly conflicted emotions toward Bazhun’an.</p><p>Only now did everyone see the shared callousness in the legendary figures.</p><p>Indeed, those who were high above regarded those beneath them as mere fodder!</p><p>The one who broke the silence in this complicated scene of farewell was none other than Xu Xiaoshou! He shouted:</p><p>“Eldest Senior Brother!”</p><p>“Hmm?” Xiao Kongtong paused and looked back with a smile. His departure seemed slow, as if he was expecting something.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at him, smiling in return.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had an extremely good impression of Big Mouth Xiao.</p><p>Whether it was his shabby appearance with a hemp sack or the act of saving him from Red Dog’s death trap…</p><p>Or the display of the true nature of a child who would recklessly tease and lose his sense of decorum when facing “Senior Water Ghost” in the deep sea…</p><p>Or impersonating Bazhun’an, perfectly restoring the style of a proud swordsman with “With each poem, a sword; with each sword, a song”…</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was extremely charming!</p><p>If this guy didn’t have Fringe Moon Immortal City, Xu Xiaoshou would definitely recruit him!</p><p>Looking at this refined Eldest Senior Brother, Xu Xiaoshou offered few words. He just said softly, “If you need anything, just holler. I might not be weaker than you now.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong chuckled, nodded, and said, “Alright.”</p><p>He didn’t waste this turn; he deeply looked at everyone, as if trying to remember all the faces.</p><p>Finally, he swiftly passed by the teacher.</p><p>He didn’t look at him…</p><p>“Take care, everyone.”</p><p>With a long howl, Xiao Kongtong turned into a sword light and leaped into the fabric of time.</p><p>Only then did Bazhun’an raise his eyes, staring in the direction Xiao Kongtong had gone, his brow furrowing with displeasure.</p><p>“This guy…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had a keen mind and could easily see the emotions others had toward Bazhun’an.</p><p>But he also knew Bazhun’an well enough to realize that he would never bother to explain these things.</p><p>“You should’ve said something. He has been waiting for you; he admires you a lot.” Xu Xiaoshou opted for candor in his words.</p><p>Only now did everyone feel relieved, casting discreet angry glances at Bazhun’an.</p><p>Indeed, this kind of situation called for someone like Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>Zhu Yike felt a sense of satisfaction; it was better to be under Lord Shou. He was one to speak his mind.</p><p>Bazhun’an remained silent, placing the bandaged hand stained with blood behind his back, casually glancing at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“It’s fine to not say anything too!” Xu Xiaoshou smiled sheepishly and said, “A thousand words are all in the unspoken, right? The deep bond between master and disciple doesn’t need much elaboration.”</p><p>Zhu Yike:</p><p>“Despised, Passive Points, +3.”</p><p>“Looked Down, Passive Points, +2.”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>After this short episode, Xu Xiaoshou angrily turned to Kong Yuhen and bluntly shouted, “Did you mess with the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff?”</p><p>“You gave it to me; how can you still control it? This is outrageous!”</p><p>Kong Yuhen waved his hands repeatedly, “Friend, you misunderstood. The Time Ancestor Shadow Staff has a spirit of its own; it also enjoys watching the show.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
