After the battle in Sky City, we discovered this malignant tumor. We launched a general attack a month ago and have yet to get rid of it.”</p><p>“In the Southern Region, it was the ungodly ghost beasts. They colluded with all the factions, rejected justice, nurtured darkness, and recruited demi-saints.</p><p>The highest rank among them was that of the Holy Emperor!”</p><p>“In the Northern Region, they infiltrated the Heavenly Covenant that resisted the extradimensional space. They took control of the Seven Breaks and the Valley of Floral Fragrance. Based on this, we could not even enter and explore, let alone launch an attack.”</p><p>“In the Western Region…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang paused and his expression turned gloomy.</p><p>“They’ve infiltrated the other four regions, so it was impossible for the Western Region to fall behind.”</p><p>“But up until now, we haven’t even gotten a taste of what their incarnations were in the Western Region.”</p><p>“This is our enemy, the Saint Servant!”</p><p>“This is the opponent we should pay attention to, Bazhun’an!”</p><p>On the peak of the Saint Mountain, everyone was shocked.</p><p>From Fen Qin to the Fringe Moon Immortal City, to the ghost beast faction, to the Seven Breaks, and even to the unknown…</p><p>All the powers that could be penetrated, Bazhun’an had already done it!</p><p>If they were not vigilant and continued in the same manner like before, would the Saint Fall be the norm?</p><p>The enemy this time could even destroy the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe?</p><p>On the Saint mountain, there was finally a feeling of panic. The three words Bazhun’an turned into a kind of fear that lingered in the depths of everyone’s minds.</p><p>The Central Region was a serene place for people.</p><p>No one was willing to give up the current golden age, no one was willing to accept a bloody battle that spanned the five regions. However, the war had unknowingly sounded a horn…</p><p>Dao Qiongcang paused for a long time.</p><p>It was only when the panic reached its limit, as if it was about to ignite, that he spoke again.</p><p>“Were the Saint Servants strong?”</p><p>“The Saint Servants are very strong! Their Chief is Bazhun’an and their peak combat strength is close to that of a Holy Emperor.”</p><p>“But were we weak?”</p><p>“We are not weak! The battle at Sky City failed only because of my negligent leadership, that led to a mistake in the general direction and the deaths of my comrades.”</p><p>“For this, I could not shirk my responsibility.”</p><p>“But we still have the Council of Ten, the six divisions, the red and white clothed people, the Holy Divine Guards, the older generation, the middle-aged, and the young who have kept their swords hidden for many years…”</p><p>“We have the strongest shields and the sharpest spears. When our comrades at the front line fall, we have more and newer blood to replace them and take over their mission…”</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s words cleared the gray haze on the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>Amid the cries and excitement from the crowd, he clenched his hand and stopped all the shouts.</p><p>“The enemy can kill us, but the enemy cannot defeat us.”</p><p>“I will appoint a new Council of Ten and the Chiefs of the six divisions. This would be my last task as Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace.”</p><p>“I believe that they will surpass me, surpass me who failed in my duty, and contribute the most absolute energy, passion and even their lives toward this new force for justice!</p><p>“After this…</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked up. Under the shocked gazes of the Saints who had a premonition about what would come next, he looked at the distant sky. “For their sakes, I have to give them an explanation!”</p><p>“I’ll step down as Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace. Senior Zhong Yuanzi will replace me temporarily, and another election will be held in the future.” “And I won’t participate in any of these.”</p><p>“My fallen comrades, I can’t save you, but this is my last apology. I’m sorry.” After Dao Qiongcang finished speaking, he bowed deeply again. “The future of the Holy Divine Palace will be in your hands….”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
