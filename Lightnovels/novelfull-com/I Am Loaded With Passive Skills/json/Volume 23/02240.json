Even though her emotions were relaxed, she should be a master.</p><p>Unexpectedly, she was one of the new generation of the Seven Sword Deity.</p><p>“Pursuit…”</p><p>He still remembered that Li Fuyu had come in search for someone.</p><p>She killed a person and entered the city in one fell swoop. As soon as she crossed the barrier, Xu Xiaoshou who was in the carriage received a notification from the Information Bar. As expected, Li Fuyu was here to look for him.</p><p>“Why would she look for me?”</p><p>Xu Gusheng’s identity was definitely non existent . At that time, even Old Man Li did not know his real name.</p><p>It would be even more ridiculous to say that Li Fuyu was here for Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>She had ‘determination’ written all over her that was Bazhun’an’s signature mark. What kind of character was Li Fuyu? Was she so capable that she could surpass Bazhun’an and he could not immobilize her?</p><p>In the Yougui Pavilion, the sickly young master frowned and pressed the paper fan against his chin.</p><p>Was she that capable?</p><p>He didn’t dare to jump to a conclusion for this question.</p><p>If it was anyone else who was better, who could compare to Bazhun’an?</p><p>However, the Seven Sword Deity, who knew what kind of talents this generation had. What if Li Fuyu really had such talent?</p><p>“Young Master Zhou, why do you still keep it hidden? Who are the Two Elders, Yi Xiao, Li Fuyu and the favored Lord Shou? Some of us can’t wait to find out.”</p><p>Young Master Zhou smiled and glanced around.</p><p>“I’m all ears.”</p><p>When he saw how the sickly young master greeted him so courteously, he relaxed a little and continued.</p><p>“The Two Elders refer to the two ancient swordsmen from the older generation, Elder Gu, Gu Yu, and Elder Yang, Yang Xizhi.”</p><p>“Yi Xiao, referred to the Eldest Senior Brother of the Fringe Moon Immortal City, Xiao Kongtong.”</p><p>“Li Fuyu, needs no introduction, right? That’s her original name. She’s one of the two female Sword Deity. That’s four of them already.”</p><p>He paused for a moment before he continued.</p><p>“Hua Lai referred to the Sword Deity Lai… This person has only one character to his name. I don’t know why he’s called ‘Hua,’ but the Southern Region’s Feng family added it either because it’s easy to say or because they have their own reasons. It’s a topic for discussion.”</p><p>“Bei Tian, referred to Sword Deity Bei Bei. There are only two female Sword Deity. I don’t know much about this person.”</p><p>“The favored Lord Shou, there’s no need to say anything more. At the moment, Saint Servant Lord Shou is in the limelight.”</p><p>I’m on the list!</p><p>Even though he was very familiar with the sound of those two words, it was not until he heard it from someone else that Xu Xiaoshou felt that this matter was settled.</p><p>“Lord Shou, he is indeed one of the Seven Sword Deity.”</p><p>“There’s the word ‘favored’ here. This Southern Region’s Feng family seemed to value Xu Xiaoshou a lot. They actually used the term ‘favored’ Lord Shou at the end…”</p><p>“I think it’s just a catchy term!”</p><p>“I don’t think so. There’s a deeper meaning to this. You have to carefully assess it, brother!”</p><p>“+(Debated, Passive Points+)+212.”</p><p>“+(Regarded, Passive Points+)+64.”</p><p>The sickly young master listened quietly to the animated discussion around him. He seemed to be in a daze, as if he was in another world.</p><p>Once upon a time, the three words ‘Seven Sword Deity’ seemed totally unreachable to him.</p><p>Now, he was one of them.</p><p>What kind of feeling was this?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t quite express his feelings.</p><p>However, Hidden Bitter, who was at his waist, listened to the flattery and occasionally heard someone state its name.</p><p>“I heard that Lord Shou has a saber called Hidden Bitter?”</p><p>“It was this sword that killed Rao Yaoyao. How strong must it be? It’s comparable to the Qingju Sword!”</p><p>When it heard this, Hidden Bitter twisted its sword body in excitement.</p><p>“Sob!”</p><p>Pah! Xu Xiaoshou smacked the restless Hidden Bitter and warned him silently about the three-point agreement that was about to come out. Hidden Bitter quieted down.</p><p>However, the surrounding environment was affected.</p><p>In other words, the transformation of Xu Xiaoshou’s state of mind could directly affect the environment and people’s hearts under the effect of the Swallow the Mountains and Rivers.</p><p>After Hidden Bitter exuded a cry, more than ten sword cries rang out from all sides of the Yougui Pavilion. Soon, everyone’s discussion quieted down.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Everyone looked around in bewilderment.</p><p>“Our discussion about the Seven Sword Deity can cause sword cries?”</p><p>“Some ancient swordsman cultivated ‘fame’. Is it because they pursued this sort of strange power?”</p><p>“I heard that it was cultivated by Bazhun’an. In the past, everyone valued ‘fame’ but not so much. This thing can only nourish the famed sword.”</p><p>“I don’t understand, but I feel that it’s very powerful. Fame… I don’t even know where to start, let alone make use of this power.”</p><p>“That’s why I said that the people of the Eastern Region are very imaginative, and the ancient swordsman are a bunch of things that fly in the sky!”</p><p>After they spoke, everyone suddenly stopped talking.</p><p>For some reason, everyone’s eyes fell on the sickly young master who sat there quietly in the middle, surrounded by the crowd.</p><p>This process was very natural.</p><p>Outsiders wouldn’t find it strange.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou observed everything with his Perception and he had an insight of all these through the eyes of an outsider.</p><p>“Force…”</p><p>Now, he was considered a demi-saint.</p><p>No matter how much he wanted to ‘hide’ , he would always be an existence that stood out from the crowd.</p><p>This was unavoidable.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not resist. With an imperceptible sneer he asked, “Young Master Zhou, do you have any more information about the new Seven Sword Deity?”</p><p>“Ah?” Young Master Zhou was distracted by the discussion that the Seven Sword Deity could also cause sword cries. He looked up and saw the sickly young master’s handsome face.</p><p>He didn’t care much about it before, but he was in awe of the power of his guards.</p><p>For some reason, he felt even more ashamed of his inferiority, as if the person who stood above him was a giant without any guards.</p><p>“I don’t know the specifics. I’m not very interested in swords….”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
