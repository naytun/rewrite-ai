If something went wrong, they would be the first to face the axe. How could they not enjoy this joke?</p><p>The young man ran over again. “Boss, this Xu Xiaoshou is so evil. Even if he really came to the Central Region, how could he enter the city through the proper channel?”</p><p>The old captain almost sent his head flying with a slap. He shouted, “It’s precisely because he is so evil that he doesn’t dare to make such a big fuss. The great array was personally set up by Hallmaster Dao in the capital. Even if he had ten guts, he wouldn’t dare to barge in!”</p><p>The old captain shook his throbbing hand and pointed at the long queue. “I don’t know how many of these people can reap benefits from the confusion. If you can find one of them, I’ll resign tomorrow and you’ll live a luxurious life instead!”</p><p>“Boss, I think that woman is quite good. She’s clearly in disguise and looks quite innocent… Xu Xiaoshou is known for his numerous disguises. I feel that she could be Xu…”</p><p>The old captain launched a flying kick and almost kicked this idiot to death. However, when he looked back, he was instantly stunned and even the wine bag in his hand dropped with a thud.</p><p>wow!</p><p>She really was a looker!</p><p>She was a tall and beautiful woman in her thirties. She had a mature and graceful body. Her thick black hair was tied back with a simple bamboo hairpin. Her neck was long and beautiful.</p><p>There were traces of dirt on her long green robe after she journeyed through the rain and snow. There was no obvious aura of any spiritual source on her body. She had a sword at her waist, and there was a hint of exotic charm in her cold and elegant appearance.</p><p>Her eyes differed slightly from her body. They were like the cold wind, that froze people in their tracks.</p><p>However, when he looked at the essence through her appearance, this kind of woman who showed such extreme contrast… The old captain could tell at a glance that she was clearly someone top- notch!</p><p>“Get out of the way. I’ll ask!”</p><p>The old captain wiped off the oil from his hands and waist and hurried over to the registration desk. He shoved the staff in front of the wooden table aside with his butt. He grabbed the jade scroll and sized up the cold swordsman who walked to the front. He chuckled and said.</p><p>“Beauty, what’s your name? Where are you from?”</p><p>The woman’s gravelly voice was like that of a sparrow’s. She probably hadn’t spoken for a long time. “Sword tower, Li Fuyu.”</p><p>Her voice wasn’t loud.</p><p>However, for some reason, the noise outside the city gate quickly quieted down as soon as she stopped speaking.</p><p>Many people turned to look at her, but surprisingly, no one made a sound.</p><p>The wind blew across the sand, and the fragrance of the osmanthus was refreshing. It was like an old wine that brought people into a beautiful dream world and numbed their sensitive nerves.</p><p>The city guards felt that something was wrong.</p><p>The old captain did not seem to notice at all. His Adam’s apple bobbed and his eyes lit up as he stared at the beautiful swordsman’s chest. He raised his eyebrows and asked.</p><p>“How old is this young lady?”</p><p>“For a weak woman like you, even if I let you enter the city, it would be difficult for you to move an inch.”</p><p>“Do you have a place to go? Old Zhao here has some assets in Jade Capital City, There’s a mansion on Changling Street…”</p><p>Liu Fuyu lowered her head as she looked sideways. Her face twitched as she gently touched her waist with her left hand.</p><p>The scabbard that was as warm and beautiful as a piece of jade quivered. There seemed to be a majestic power that thrust the sword body out.</p><p>“Protect!”</p><p>Li Fuyu muttered softly, and the sand under her feet stirred.</p><p>With a click, the long white sword at her waist flashed and disappeared. It appeared to be unsheathed, yet it was also as if it had never moved.</p><p>In an instant, the sunlight faded. A sword that measured a hundred feet in length rose from the ground, plowed through the wooden table, and slashed towards the old captain.</p><p>The old captain did not even have time to panic. His body glowed with a heavenly spiritual light. In the next second, he was torn apart instantly and his blood and flesh splattered everywhere.</p><p>The sword light then hit the ancient plaque on the Jade Capital City with a loud bang.</p><p>“Buzz! ”</p><p>The so-called number one city in the Central Region trembled slightly. The people in the city seemed to have sensed it and looked back.</p><p>Faint starlight lit up in all directions of the city. The divine path patterns were outlined in the sky, and soon, the sword light dissipated totally.</p><p>Perhaps someone had broken into the city, but Hallmaster Dao wiped out the ants. It was already a common occurrence, so everyone turned a blind eye to it.</p><p>Outside the city.</p><p>The plaque was intact, and the corpse was divided into two parts.</p><p>Only then did the young team member at the back let out a cry of surprise, but it was already too late.</p><p>His eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>The old captain was not an ordinary person. He had the cultivation level of a Sovereign Dao Realm and the divine mystic gold token was tied to the capital’s great array. This allowed him to borrow a portion of its strength.</p><p>Even if it was borrowed passively, that token could still block a full-powered attack from a higher void. How could he be killed so instantly and silently?</p><p>Everyone looked at the two halves of the corpse at the city gate and all kept quiet out of fear.</p><p>Finally, the long line of people exclaimed.</p><p>“Ancient Swordsman!”</p><p>“She’s an ancient swordsman from the Eastern Region!”</p><p>“No wonder. I knew that there was no aura of spiritual source on this person’s body. I thought that she was also a mortal. I didn’t expect her to be so fierce. It’s a good thing I didn’t provoke her…”</p><p>“Li Fuyu. What a familiar name. Where have I heard it before?”</p><p>The young man’s teeth chattered as he looked at the cold-eyed beauty in front of him as if he had seen a demon.</p><p>“Enemy attack!”</p><p>He let out a sharp shriek. “Hurry up and spread the news. Don’t let her escape. She killed Captain Zhao!”</p><p>The city guards at the back seemed to have woken up from a dream and they sprang into action.</p><p>Li Fuyu slashed a person with her jade sword so nonchalantly and then walked into the city.</p><p>“Don’t come over!”</p><p>There was no reply.</p><p>“Stop, stop… stop! Now you’re a criminal with a bounty on your head, what do you want!”</p><p>“Enter the city.” Enter the city?</p><p>She could reply?</p><p>“What’s your purpose to enter the city?” The young man quickly asked. He realized that if his gaze was not disrespectful, he would not die.. He finally realized what caused the old captain’s death!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
