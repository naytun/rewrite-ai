I am not equal to your Yougui Pavilion’s standards. This money can be used to feed the dogs… Everyone, let’s go.”</p><p>The sickly young master swung his sleeves and left with his guard.</p><p>When the people around heard this, they immediately started a discussion.</p><p>From the looks of it, the Yougui Pavilion had indeed been unfair.</p><p>If Xu Gusheng didn’t have that bodyguard to protect him, he would have suffered a double loss. “Young Master!”</p><p>“Young Master Xu!”</p><p>Yingying, Qiao’er, and the others were anxious.</p><p>This sickly young master’s prestige was too high. If word got out, no one would dare to come to the Yougui Pavilion again.</p><p>“It’s not like that…” Old Ghostface was also anxious.</p><p>In a moment of desperation, he stood in front of Young Master Xu and explained, “I came to look for you. I was the one who set this up. It had nothing to do with the Yougui Pavilion or Aunt Xiang. Don’t try to tarnish their innocence.” “Wonderful!”</p><p>“Truly wonderful! ”</p><p>The sickly young master applauded and looked around at everyone. He laughed loudly.</p><p>“The Yougui Pavilion, Ghost God gang and Aunt Xiang are simply something else! ”</p><p>“If there’s no problem, find someone to create one. If something went wrong, get rid of the person. If something happened, stay out of it. You can even find someone willing to take the blame. This is too wonderful.”</p><p>“I didn’t know that the Ten High Nobles were so awe-inspiring. As soon as I stepped into your pavilion, I felt ashamed.”</p><p>“Since that’s the case, you guys can continue to play. I am too embarrassed and do not dare to accompany you. Why stop me?”</p><p>The sickly young master’s gaze fell on Old Ghostface, who was more than a head taller than him. He said.</p><p>“A sensible person would not interfere. Don’t block the way. Get lost!”</p><p>Old Ghostface instantly felt countless gazes on him that were as sharp as swords.</p><p>He held himself back and almost suffered internal injuries.</p><p>He knew he was in the wrong and he couldn’t get angry under this barrage of insults. He could only step aside and make way.</p><p>“Master… ”</p><p>Yingying, Qiao’er, and the other beauties froze instantly as if they had been struck by lightning. At this moment, they felt that even the air they breathed in was icy cold.</p><p>This fellow…</p><p>This guy’s mouth could fight an army of ten thousand people!</p><p>Such remarks left the Yougui Pavilion in the limelight. It was even more unbearable than if the place had been torn down!</p><p>A huge commotion broke out and everyone felt disgusted.</p><p>“Haha, the Yogui Pavilion had provoked a tough opponent. Let’s see what they’ll do next!”</p><p>“This Xu Gusheng is too good at talking. I thought that he was just a nobody who would be easily bullied and destroyed by the Ghost God gang. I didn’t expect this guy to turn the tables. Amazing.”</p><p>“Heh, if it were not for his guard, Xu Gusheng would have died long ago. The one who is powerful isn’t him, but his guard.”</p><p>“I don’t think so! I think that sickly young master has a mean mouth, and his swordsmanship is not any lower than that of his guard.”</p><p>“Are the people of the Eastern Region all so sharp-tongued…”</p><p>The onlookers didn’t think that the matter was a big deal. They watched as the guard disappeared and the sickly young master departed.</p><p>“+(lnfatuated. Passive Points), +322.”</p><p>“+(lmpressed, Passive Points+) +541.”</p><p>“+(Debated. Passive Points+), +1249.”</p><p>Just as he was about to step out of the Yougui Pavilion, a graceful figure walked down the round osmanthus staircase.</p><p>“Young Master, please wait. Aunt Xiang would like to invite you!”</p><p>The woman held her pipa to her side and her voice was crisp and melodious. Her steps were slightly hurried and unsteady. It was obvious that she had been playing music in the pavilion and had rushed over.</p><p>As she approached, he saw that this woman had exceptionally beautiful eyes and lips, jade-like skin, delicate bones, and her silk dress rippled like waves. Every step she took mesmerized and shook people up.</p><p>“Greetings, I am Ah Yao.”</p><p>After Miss Ah Yao went downstairs, she first bowed to everyone and displayed her courtly elegance. Then, she looked at the back of the person who was about to step out of the pavilion.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, please wait.”</p><p>“Aunt Xiang was late due to a previous engagement and tne yougul pavilion had neglected our honored guest. I apologize on their behalf.”</p><p>“I wonder if Young Master would do me the honor and go upstairs with me for a chat?”</p><p>Silence fell both inside and outside the pavilion.</p><p>Everyone stared at Miss Ah Yao with desire. It was as if they were looking at a person who had walked out of a painting. Her beauty was incomparable.</p><p>“Miss Ah Yao came down…”</p><p>After the dead silence, a huge clamor suddenly rose from the crowd.</p><p>“Oh my God, I come here every day just to see Miss Ah Yao. The Yougui Pavilion would say daily that Miss Ah Yao will come out. It’s been a month and I haven’t seen her yet, right?”</p><p>“It’s worth it! It was worth it this time! Today, when I went out, I used the Divine Secret to do a divination. The divination said that I was fated to meet my sweetheart, and it was actually true!”</p><p>“Quick, agree to her request! Xu Gusheng, how dare you refuse her?” “Don’t agree to her! Xu Gusheng, you can’t go. Let me go… Wuwuwu.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou really wanted to leave.</p><p>He had given face to Bazhun’an, which was why he had waited here for Aunt Xiang for such a long time. She had only brought him problems.</p><p>He also had quite a temper!</p><p>As the second-in-command saint servant and the Tower Master of the First Pavilion in the Sky, when he, Xu Xiaoshou, made up his mind, even ten oxen couldn’t pull him back!</p><p>However, his Perception was too annoying. He clearly didn’t want to see or hear it, but the passive skill still sent images and sounds over.</p><p>This news shocked Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Unlike the other beauties in the Yougui Pavilion, who wore thin gauze dresses that barely covered their bodies, Miss Ah Yao was like a snow lotus in the murky pond, unstained by mud. Her clothes were appropriate and did not conceal her graceful figure.</p><p>The only unfortunate thing was that she wasn’t a Spiritual Cultivator. She was just a mortal.</p><p>At this moment, because she had been in a hurry to go downstairs, she panted slightly, and the pipa in her arms rose and fell with her breath.</p><p>With such a gentle push, the woman’s soft voice coaxed Xu Xiaoshou to stay. Xu Xiaoshou felt that he was under the guidance of a powerful Holy Emperor and could only turn around.</p><p>“Apologize?” Xu Xiaoshou stopped, but the sickly young master still sneered..</p><p>“You’re just going to apologize verbally and let this matter go?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
