It was a world that had terrible conditions.</p><p>It had the potential to become the best world, but it required too much effort. Without the help of the Ancestor Tree, whether it would be able to evolve successfully in millions of years was unknown.</p><p>Even better than the Yuan Mansion world, was the extradimensional space like the White Cave.</p><p>Although those places were not suitable for human habitation, they had the embryonic form of a small world and their lives were able to evolve together with the World Order.</p><p>It wasn’t suitable for Spiritual Cultivators, but it was definitely suitable for creatures of the original world like Ice and Ember.</p><p>Further up would be the greater worlds that were suitable for all races and had perfect rules of the Great Path and the power of self-circulation.</p><p>The Shengshen Continent could be a representative.</p><p>What the Dragon Apricot tried to promote now was the path of evolution from the Yuan Mansion world to the greater world.</p><p>Even with the Dragon Apricot’s help, this process seemed to be time-consuming and laborious. It should have taken tens of thousands of years to succeed, but Xu Xiaoshou felt that the progress was very fast.</p><p>He stepped on the Time Dao Discs and quickly sensed the flow of time in this world. It had been accelerated many times.</p><p>However, all of this did not affect him at all. One could imagine the exquisite control the Dragon Apricot had over its power.</p><p>Amid the towering crown of the Dragon Apricot tree carved in the void, the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff emitted a faint light and manifested its borrowed power in a physical form.</p><p>“This is the power of time that the Dragon Apricot mentioned. So that how it’s being used here.” Xu Xiaoshou now understood.</p><p>From the looks of it, the reason why the Dragon Apricot was tempted previously was indeed because it had everything ready. It only needed one thought from it to get things going.</p><p>Crack.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt something split open.</p><p>He seemed to have understood something and thought of what the Dragon</p><p>Apricot had said before. The world was about to evolve, and the Yuan Mansion’s main body would be removed.</p><p>He cast his second true body to the outside world to have a perception of it.</p><p>As expected, every time he entered the Yuan Mansion world, the substantial Yuan Mansion would turn into dust and hide in the space.</p><p>Now, as the Internal World split and reassembled, its outer appearance was no longer that of a stone. Instead, it had shattered and became intangible.</p><p>His second true body stepped on the Space Dao Disc and with its Perception, could sense that the Yuan Mansion world had not lost its outer appearance, but had completely merged into the space.</p><p>It was anchored within the spatial fragment and used a spatial node to contain the vast power. It collapsed from the inside and turned into a world.</p><p>This was the transformation of the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>There was no real space within the spatial fragment, let alone the Dao of Time.</p><p>Therefore, this point had no fixed location and was not only located outside of the Yougui Pavilion.</p><p>It could be anything.</p><p>It could be any spatial node in the Eastern Region, Central Region, Southern Region, and so on.</p><p>As long as it wanted to, as long as its owner activated it, it could be manifested like the Abyss Island and smashed into the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>The essence had changed!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was ecstatic. In the past, he was always worried that after he entered the Yuan Mansion. the Yuan Mansion itself would be discovered and destroyed. This would lead to the collapse of the Yuan Mansion world.</p><p>Right now, this method could no longer destroy the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>His world was rooted in the void, and no one could fundamentally destroy it.</p><p>Even if someone were to stumble upon the space node of the Yuan Mansion world like how Liu Changqing stumbled into Abyss Island.</p><p>In this space, with the Dragon Apricot Tree, one of the Nine Great Ancestral Trees, as the World Tree, how could it not be discovered and stopped in advance?</p><p>Would the Dragon Apricot allow people to enter the home that was under its protection?</p><p>“Spatial evolution, unless you are in a life or death situation, do not enter or leave!”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot tried its best to mobilize its strength and had no choice but to take the time to remind this unruly human boy.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickly replied with an ‘Oh!’.</p><p>After he thought about it, he decided not to let his second true body in. He would just let it wait outside!</p><p>“Hey, where’s the snow?”</p><p>Outside the Yougui Pavilion, there was a child who played in the snow on the long street. He tried to catch the falling snowflakes that would land on his palms.</p><p>This would have been the norm.</p><p>However, for some reason, the snowflakes that were about to touch his palms suddenly disappeared without a trace.</p><p>The child mumbled and moved on.</p><p>However, there had been too many similar incidents that happened, and some of them directly affected the Spiritual Cultivators.</p><p>Someone had just paid the bill and stepped out of the restaurant. Just as he was about to go down the stone stairs, he took an additional step as he stepped out of the threshold.</p><p>“Strange, why did it feel like I had taken two steps…”</p><p>The shopkeeper was about to put the Spirit Crystals into the cabinet when he suddenly realized that there was nothing in his hands. He hurriedly looked at the door and said.</p><p>“Sir, the bill hasn’t been paid yet!”</p><p>“Impossible, I just… Hey, didn’t I just take them out? Why aren’t there any Spirit Crystals left?”</p><p>Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, Saint Hall.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had already dismissed all the troops.</p><p>The Council of Ten and the Chiefs of the six divisions entered the Council Hall.</p><p>Of course, the six divisions were not qualified enough and could only stand on one side. There was no extra space for them to sit.</p><p>After Dao Qiongcang finished issuing instructions to the members of the Heavenly Group, he had yet to dismiss everyone when the divine Sinan in his hand quivered slightly.</p><p>“Crack.”</p><p>The star dipper turned and pointed in a certain direction.</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao…” The Dark Division Chief, Nian, spoke.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked out of the hall and raised his hand without looking back, and stopped her from speaking.</p><p>Everyone stopped asking questions and looked back curiously in that direction.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen didn’t turn around.</p><p>Her starry eyes lit up slightly. She glanced at the divine Sinan that was not hidden and meant that she could peep at Hallmaster Dao. She seemed to have read something and calculated with her fingertips that were hidden in her sleeve..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
