(3)</h1><p>Chapter 2201: How Can I Not Be Free and Unfettered After Becoming a Banished Immortal? (3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>No matter how weak Xu Xiaoshou was and how jaded his appearance and body was, he still looked handsome and extraordinary after being continuously strengthened by this ‘Strengthen’ force.</p><p>In the past, he had always concealed his appearance and he also had the Stealth on his body. He was afraid that it would come as a shock, so it was difficult for outsiders to notice.</p><p>Now that he was exhausted, that valiant yet delicate face was revealed. He looked like a young master who was sick after he practiced martial arts due to his fragile constitution from birth.</p><p>However, when one’s gaze shifted, his muscular arms were revealed under his torn robe after the battle, as well as the well-proportioned bronze muscles on his abdomen that seemed to have been meticulously carved by a celestial being. All these proved that he had relied on his own strength in the previous battle and that his power was not only an illusion.</p><p>As Xiao Kongtong watched, he understood a little.</p><p>Wasn’t this the combination of his Teacher and his wife that he had seen when he was young?</p><p>The focus of the world seemed to be fixed on this perfect couple at the moment. No one made any sound for a long time.</p><p>There were no praises or sighs about Xu Xiaoshou’s combat strength. Everyone’s attention began to shift.</p><p>“Hah, Xu Xiaoshou is so strong? I really couldn’t tell when he was fully clothed!</p><p>This muscle tone was too… Hiss! I can’t stand it, I really can’t!”</p><p>“Who is that silver-haired woman? She is simply too beautiful. She should be on the list of beauties!”</p><p>“Yes, why haven’t I seen such a beauty before? How could there be such a woman by Xu Xiaoshou’s side? I remember that he only has a silly junior sister.</p><p>What was her name again?”</p><p>“Maybe it’s her? Women are known to undergo eighteen transformations?” “Then this transformation is too extreme!”</p><p>“Look, her silver hair, her eyes… They’re so beautiful! I’ve never seen such beautiful eyes before. One black and one white, strange yet powerful, mysterious yet noble. What kind of eyes are these?”</p><p>. Lei Family’s Eyes, that is not beauty, that is the beginning of evil.” Li Fugui sighed deeply.</p><p>The few who knew about the history of the Lei Family’s Eyes had strange expressions on their faces. They felt pity for this silver-haired woman’s past.</p><p>But at the same time, her past and her face, coupled with this appearance, added to her mysterious aura.</p><p>The scene after the battle was imprinted in the minds of countless people. It was as beautiful as a painting.</p><p>“Ta, ta, ta…”</p><p>The sound of steady footsteps came from behind the ruins.</p><p>Some people turned around and saw a weak Mei Siren, who waved his fan and had a proud and happy expression on his face.</p><p>There were several words written in thick ink on the fan:</p><p>“You’re a worthy student!”</p><p>It was only then that everyone remembered that Xu Xiaoshou seemed to be Mei Siren’s student.</p><p>How proud would a Teacher be when his student replicated his shocking sword move in front of his Teacher?</p><p>However, before their thoughts could settle, the man who passed behind Mei Siren and appeared truly caused a huge uproar in the hearts of all those who looked at him.</p><p>There was a scar on his neck and he only had eight fingers on his hand…</p><p>Bazhun’an!</p><p>The person who had been far away from the Forest of Miracles and appeared in the spirit mirror, now walked forward unhurriedly and finally arrived at the battlefield.</p><p>He only stayed in the background and didn’t do anything. The overall situation was in his favor, and the heavenly pillars of the Holy Divine Palace had been cut down.</p><p>Now that he had appeared at this place, he only needed to face one last person.</p><p>His old rival, Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>So, was there any suspense?</p><p>On the horizon, Dao Qiongcang turned and looked over from above. He sneered as he spoke first.</p><p>“Bazhun’an, to be honest, I’m not used to your silent entrance.”</p><p>“If it were you in the past, you would have been surrounded by moving clouds and sword cries. Only after you gathered the attention of thousands of people, would you then make your stunning appearance.”</p><p>“You are old after all.”</p><p>“You also learned to scheme against others behind the scenes and became the rat that you hated the most… just like me!”</p><p>Everyone was shocked when they heard that. Dao Qiongcang actually belittled himself just to insult Bazhun’an?</p><p>So this was his old rival…</p><p>Their gazes fell on Bazhun’an, whose face was pale and he indeed looked a little down and out, and everyone was secretly sad.</p><p>It seemed that Dao Qiongcang was right.</p><p>The Eighth Sword Deity, a figure that existed only in legends, was really old!</p><p>But at this moment, Bazhun’an burst into laughter.</p><p>Under everyone’s astonished gazes, he took a step forward on the ruins and raised the dust all around as he chanted loudly.</p><p>“When the dream is happy, I come from the sky. I don’t want to offend the mortals. Half the world welcomes the flowers.</p><p>“After I wake up from the dream, I came from the dust and became a banished immortal. How can I not be free and unfettered?”</p><p>After a pause, Bazhun’an looked up into the sky and smiled faintly.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang, why are you so nostalgic and still living in the past?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
