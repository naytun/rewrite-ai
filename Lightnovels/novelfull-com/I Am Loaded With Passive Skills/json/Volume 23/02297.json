He had bound two Awakening Stones and thrown them into the Awakening Pool at the same time. In the end, he failed..</p><p>However, the order was at first successful, then it failed. Therefore, the one that failed triggered a new entry-second awakening failure.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hadn’t forgotten about this.</p><p>Unfortunately, there were always not enough Passive Points. Or rather, his growth speed was too fast, so he did not have time to earn more Passive Points. He was afraid that he would waste too much and end up with nothing, so he didn’t dare to attempt a second awakening.</p><p>Now, it seemed like it could be picked up and studied again.</p><p>Passive Points: 3562552.</p><p>Awakening Stone: 100000 Passive Points.</p><p>“According to the usual probability, I can succeed within ten attempts. If I’m lucky, I can even succeed after the first or second time.”</p><p>“Then I should be able to succeed with a million Passive Points for the second awakening.”</p><p>“I’m afraid that if this did not work out, than more than three million Passive Points would be wasted. I don’t think so…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated.</p><p>This was because the current inventory was enough to upgrade all his passive skills to the Holy Emperor Lv.o. This was a real breakthrough in combat strength, and there were no hidden dangers.</p><p>However, the second awakening was not a certainty.</p><p>so…</p><p>Let’s take a gamble. Or should he just play safe?</p><p>“Reckless!”</p><p>Once his heart made a decision, it was very difficult to retract it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickly made up his mind and decided to follow his heart.</p><p>Passive Points: 3562552.</p><p>Passive Points: 2562552.</p><p>One million Passive Points were deducted in an instant, and ten Awakening Stones were exchanged.</p><p>The Awakening Stones were not divided into the first Awakening Stone and the second Awakening Stone. They would only increase in price with each breakthrough in a major realm. This was unscrupulous, but it was also conscientious.</p><p>After the exchange succeeded, Xu Xiaoshou’s heart bled, but he thought that</p><p>2.5 million Passive Points would be enough to max out all his passive skills.</p><p>Then, he would take this one million to test the water and see what the effect</p><p>of the second awakening would be.</p><p>“Berserk Giant or Vanishing Technique?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou once again chose between the two most commonly used awakened skills and did not consider anything else.</p><p>The rest would only be the icing on the cake and provide timely assistance.</p><p>As expected, the Berserk Giant’s second awakening would definitely go to the other extreme in terms of output and the Vanishing Technique would be a better way to stay alive.</p><p>“Vanishing Technique!”</p><p>“After all, if I don’t break through now, I’ll be doomed if I encounter someone like The Divine in the future…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart turned cold when he thought of that fierce person’s methods.</p><p>“If I can successfully awaken it within ten attempts, I do not need to consider using any other skills. I can also use a million Passive Points to bet on the Berserk Giant’s second awakening. This way, my damage output will go crazy again. ”</p><p>“However, if it goes down the drain, I won’t have to consider a second awakening for a long time… Definitely! We can’t be impulsive!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sorted out his thoughts. He did not have any intention of threatening or pressuring the system. He just went through it in his mind. It was very simple.</p><p>He began to bind the Awakening Stone to the Stealth.</p><p>With a bang, the Berserk Giant suddenly transformed into a red-eyed being in the Apricot Realm. He quickly rose into the sky of the Apricot Realm, bowed, and roared.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Whether it was a shotgun or a cannon depended on this moment of fate!</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit noticed its owner, who could even make cats feel ashamed, but it was used to it and could still lick its paws to admire it.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot was greatly shocked.</p><p>It had already returned to its physical form from the pattern state and returned to the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer. However, its roots were anchored in the Order of the Great Path of the Apricot Realm.</p><p>As the World Tree that protected this world, when the Dragon Apricot saw the Golden Giant that suddenly appeared, it subconsciously thought that a void attendant had made its way in.</p><p>After it recognized the aura, it silently retreated and shelved all the initial plans it had to deal with the enemy.</p><p>In the interface of the Passive System, the tug-of-war officially began!</p><p>“Second awakening failed.”</p><p>“Second awakening failed.”</p><p>“Second awakening failed.”</p><p>Whoosh! Bang!</p><p>The process was very fast, and there were no accidents.</p><p>A loud crash sounded. Greedy the Cat Spirit stood at the edge of the alchemy cauldron and watched as the Golden Giant fell from the sky and created a huge pit as it smashed into the ground.</p><p>“Meow?”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot was also quite curious about what this human boy was up to.</p><p>Did he vent something?</p><p>Otherwise, how could he instantly fall from being in a state of full health to a state of emptiness?</p><p>In the deep pit, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t even maintain the form of the Berserk Giant and turned into a human. His Dao heart was in chaos and there were faint signs of cultivation deviation.</p><p>“I, I failed…</p><p>His fingers trembled as he looked at the sky with no emotions in his eyes. He did not understand why a mere thought or a breath could use up the millions of Passive Points that he had worked so hard to earn.</p><p>But he didn’t get anything!</p><p>Ten awakenings!</p><p>Ten failures!</p><p>“Are you kidding me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes turned red. He bounced up with a bang and felt a wave of anger in his heart.</p><p>He subconsciously wanted to exchange a million Passive Points to play around with. “I don’t believe it…”</p><p>“Calm down, Boss!”</p><p>The second true body in the Apricot Realm trembled as it tried to dissuade him.</p><p>He felt that if he failed again, his main body might even kill him to vent his anger. He would say that he did it in order to produce a more perfect body.</p><p>“I won’t use the remaining passive skills. After all, most of the time, they are just icing on the cake… What do you think of using the balance of money to place a bet, Jin Ren?” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were bloodshot as he asked this question.</p><p>“I think that since you’re the boss, it’s fine as long as you think so…” Jin Ren blindly agreed even though it could be killed at any moment.</p><p>“Then what if you can’t give a suggestion now and die a sudden death?”</p><p>“Boss! Even if I give a suggestion, I’ll die if the goods are not delivered!” Jin Ren cried.. How could he not know what was on his mind?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
