(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Lord Shou?</p><p>Did Bazhun’an just call him Lord Shou?</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Not only did Xu Xiaoshou jump in surprise, but everyone around was also baffled by this address.</p><p>This was too absurd!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was known for his eccentricities and occasional bouts of Exploding Posture and Berserk Giant in mid-conversation.</p><p>Yet, witnessing his moments of silliness repeatedly, everyone could only begrudgingly come to terms with it.</p><p>People could understand when he referred to himself as Young Master Xu, but for Bazhun’an to address him as “Lord Shou”…</p><p>What was going on in his mind?</p><p>Everyone had the immediate urge to laugh.</p><p>However, when they looked at Bazhun’an, despite the awl«vardness and bizarreness, his words carried a hint of sincerity.</p><p>He played the fool, but there was an element of truth!</p><p>“What… what did you say…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou struggled to contain his emotions.</p><p>His lips slightly curved upward, but he felt that it was compromising his dignity. So, he stared at the “Shou” command token with a twitching face, struggling to regain composure.</p><p>“I said…”</p><p>Bazhun’an chuckled, waved the token in his hand, and said, “Lord Shou, I have prepared your command token. If you accept now, the position of the second-in-command saint servant is yours.”</p><p>Second in command!</p><p>The second utterance of “Lord Shou” extinguished the peculiar expressions on everyone’s faces, and the words “second-in-command” left everyone in awe.</p><p>Water Ghost’s face froze.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong couldn’t close his mouth.</p><p>Zhu Yike, in the back, felt dizzy, gazing at Lord Shou and the legendary figure who addressed him with such reverence, akin to a mortal beholding a true dragon.</p><p>Even the tiny white weasel, Elder Han, perched on Lei Xi’er’s palm, had an expression of disbelief.</p><p>He had listened to Lord Shou talk about his relationship with Bazhun’an in the Zhen Huang Palace, but he never expected reality to be more shocking than the tales.</p><p>Bazhun’an, addressing him as “Lord Shou,” and using the position of “second in command” as leverage—all just to bind Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>While the address had an element of humor, who else in the world could make Bazhun’an use such whimsical and peculiar tones and address someone so respectfully?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, the person in question, reached out, and his hand trembled slightly. It was embarrassing, and he quickly suppressed it.</p><p>He had heard Bazhun’an clearly, and though he controlled his hand, his lips involuntarily stretched toward his ears.</p><p>It was him!</p><p>Bazhun’an!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could mock and criticize him, but he fully acknowledged Bazhun’an’s achievements.</p><p>Even in the duel with Xiao Kongtong, facing an imposter, he had seen how extraordinary Bazhun’an was in his prime.</p><p>Such a figure, even if scrutinized, Xu Xiaoshou could only find minor flaws like breathing.</p><p>Bazhun’an was only a step away from becoming a true legend!</p><p>His demise would likely turn the Ten Sections of the Finger Sword into a lost divine skill, studied fervently by future generations just to comprehend sword cognition.</p><p>Not to mention his personal saber, Sword Observation Manual, and his unparalleled application of various sword techniques.</p><p>And now, this formidable figure invited him to join the Saint Servants, taking the position of Elder Sang as second-in-command, above Water Ghost…</p><p>“Hey… ahem, well!”</p><p>“What? What did you say? I didn’t quite catch that?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cleared his throat and inquired seriously, muscles on his face twitching.</p><p>While outwardly calm, his cheek muscles kept convulsing. He could only conceal the spasms using “Transformation” to prevent any visible expression.</p><p>This was really shameless!</p><p>Once or twice was understandable, but thrice seemed a bit too much.</p><p>This time, even the white weasel with a shrunken brain could see that Lord Shou was pretending to be clueless, clearly addicted to hearing the title.</p><p>Yet, Bazhun’an, like a fool, seemed oblivious to everything, and with a slight smile, he patiently said, “Do I need to say it a fourth time, Lord Shou?” “Hehehe…” Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t hold back his giggles, turning to look at his junior sister, “I originally intended to reject him…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er caught a glimpse of Xu Xiaoshou’s cheap smile and couldn’t help but chuckle, “You could do that.”</p><p>“But he’s so sincere!”</p><p>Three calls of Lord Shou in public…</p><p>Who could resist that?</p><p>If it were Water Ghost, he would probably say, “Alright, no need for an answer; I’ll help you for free this time!”</p><p>Turning to Bazhun’an again, Xu Xiaoshou felt that this old man was quite handsome, even his hazy eyes exuded the charm of a mature man.</p><p>However, he reminded himself not to be swayed. Controlling the smile on his face, he resumed his calm demeanor.</p><p>“I should refuse you, to be honest…”</p><p>“I am the Tower Master of the First Pavilion in the Sky. Becoming your second-in-command would be lowering my status…”</p><p>“No, no, no,” Bazhun’an waved his hand, interrupting with a smile, “You misunderstood me, Lord Shou.”</p><p>Damn, he had to stop calling him that… Xu Xiaoshou’s lips curved, almost agreeing directly, but he forced down the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Bazhun’an continued, “The First Pavilion in the Sky has already separated and stands independently, noble and dignified.”</p><p>“Like Sleeveless and me, we will cooperate in the future as equals.”</p><p>“I won’t give you orders, nor will you take them, as you won’t be obedient anymore. We’ll discuss, plan, and allocate tasks together. No one is superior to the other.”</p><p>After a pause, Bazhun’an’s face revealed a strange and playful expression once again..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
