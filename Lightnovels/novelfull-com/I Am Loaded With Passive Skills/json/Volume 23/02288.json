It was not an exaggeration to say that it was a body at the demi-saint level.</p><p>It was hard to imagine that there was still a young man who could cultivate his body to such a level after himself.</p><p>“This is Xu Gusheng.”</p><p>Before The Divine could say anything, Aunt Xiang introduced him first, afraid that the idiot would blurt out, “You’re Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>After a pause, she looked at her man. “The Divine.”</p><p>It was just two simple words without any prefix or suffix.</p><p>Aunt Xiang believed that Xu Xiaoshou understood the weight of this name.</p><p>“Greetings, Senior.”</p><p>The second true body obviously still had a strong desire to live. He rejected the original body’s cheap suggestion of ‘If you can’t beat him, then hurt him first and take advantage of him with words’. He cupped his fists and bowed respectfully.</p><p>Even if he was the second-in-command of the Saint Servant in secret, and The</p><p>Divine was the third, The Divine should bow to him. Those who thought so would probably die a sudden death, right?</p><p>“Where did you learn your ancient martial arts?” The bald virtual image of The Divine did not have much time, so he went straight to the point.</p><p>Aunt Xiang couldn’t help but look over curiously.</p><p>She was also aware that Xu Xiaoshou’s body was very strong. It was rumored that he could even enlarge his size and increase his combat strength.</p><p>These were things that even Sleeveless couldn’t teach him.</p><p>Then Xu Xiaoshou must have had his own fortuitous encounter.</p><p>“Self-study.” The second true body sized up the bald man as he explained. It was if he wanted to ingrain this person into his mind so he would not forget any details.</p><p>“Then you are very powerful.” The Divine nodded in approval.</p><p>The second true body was stunned for a moment. When he looked up, he didn’t see any traces of sarcasm on the bald man’s face.</p><p>He praised him sincerely!</p><p>He believed his story!</p><p>Such a ridiculous thing, even if what he said was only half the truth, any normal person would not believe it, right?</p><p>Aunt Xiang was a normal person. She pursed her lips when she heard that. “Who are you trying to fool?!”</p><p>“I was self-taught in the beginning.” The Divine gave his Xiang’er a serious look.</p><p>Aunt Xiang was speechless. She was unwilling to admit that there were two such outstanding people in the world.</p><p>“You know the Eight Doors and the Seven Constellations?” The Divine asked.</p><p>“I don’t.” The second true body thought that this should be the ancient martial arts method of acupoint stimulation.</p><p>“What about the Six Paths?”</p><p>“I don’t either.” The Human Realm Dao that The Divine had just displayed was one of the Six Paths. It turned a virtual image into a real person and possessed some of his power?</p><p>The Divine took a deep breath. He had a look of surprise as he said. “It seems that what you’ve learned is the Nine Palaces. You’ve just started, but you’re already very powerful.”</p><p>The second true body shook its head again.</p><p>The Divine’s expression froze.</p><p>He didn’t think too much about it. After all, it was 100% impossible. So, he pulled away and asked, “You haven’t learned any actual ancient martial arts?”</p><p>“Yes.” The second true body nodded. “I’m just working my way through. I have just come across the term ‘ancient martial arts’ recently.”</p><p>The Divine was not surprised, but he was happy and his eyes lit up.</p><p>He turned to look at Aunt Xiang and pointed at the sickly young master. “This child is like me. He’ll definitely become a true dragon in the future!”</p><p>Aunt Xiang was shocked.</p><p>Everyone in the world knew that Xu Xiaoshou’s Body Technique was extraordinary, but she did not expect that this kid had never even heard of ancient martial arts.</p><p>How talented was he to be able to master the Body Technique by self-study alone?</p><p>As their hearts connected, Aunt Xiang instantly saw the look of appreciation of his talent in The Divine’s eyes. This fool was moved!</p><p>“I don’t have much time…” The Divine grabbed the sickly young master’s shoulder. “Go to the Ghost God gang and find a person called Ghostface. Ask him to teach you the Eight Doors and Seven Constellations. Xianger can arrange it for you.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t expect The Divine to have such a change of heart.</p><p>He clearly wanted to kill him a moment ago, but now he wanted to teach him ancient martial arts?</p><p>Was it because of the word ‘Shou’ that Aunt Xiang had written on his hand just now?</p><p>Then wasn’t this fool a little too trusting of Bazhun’an? He believed that I’m a good person just like that?</p><p>“Your talent is not bad. It shouldn’t take more than a few years.”</p><p>“After you’re done with your lessons, come look for me at the Cross Corner Street in the City of the Dead Bodhisattva. I’ll teach you the Six Paths.”</p><p>“Don’t worry. The Eyes of the Great Path is already tired of watching me. He doesn’t have time to watch you. After you’re done with your learning, I’ll find an opportunity to send you out.”</p><p>The Divine was also very anxious. As he spoke, he looked up at the sky. Clearly, he sensed that something was coming.</p><p>Aunt Xiang frowned. “D*mmit! The Divine, you haven’t asked anyone yet!”</p><p>Only then did The Divine come to his senses. He stared into the sickly young master’s eyes and spoke seriously.</p><p>“Little brat, tell me, do you want to learn ancient martial arts?”</p><p>Yes!</p><p>I really want to!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou who was in the Apricot Realm did not expect happiness to come so suddenly. He was still thinking of how he would trick Ghostface.</p><p>At the very least, he would steal his Yang Opening and Fluctuating Ray techniques.</p><p>He didn’t expect The Divine be willing to teach him. This was the best.</p><p>However, the second true body only opened its mouth and did not speak.</p><p>The Divine’s eyelids twitched as he turned around.</p><p>“There’s no time!”</p><p>“Brat, think about it carefully. Once you’ve thought it through, tell Aunt Xiang the answer. She’ll arrange everything.”</p><p>“Now, some fellows are being very annoying…”</p><p>“It just so happened that this is the Jade Capital City. The distance is close enough for me to teach them a lesson..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
