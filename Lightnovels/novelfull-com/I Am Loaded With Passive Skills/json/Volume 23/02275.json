It took a long time to grind out a wisp of energy for his own use. This was the efficiency of the current Breathing Technique transformation of the power of the Heavenly Ancestor.</p><p>What Xu Xiaoshou needed to do was to upgrade this disc into a millstone made from the Heaven Mending Stone. In a short time, he would dissolve that power and completely release his combat strength.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Passive Points: 6562544.</p><p>Passive Points: 6062544.</p><p>50,000 Level Points for one Level Four Skill Point. Xu Xiaoshou exchanged them for ten lots, and 500,000 Passive Points were instantly used up.</p><p>Of course, the effects brought about by the skill points were extremely impressive!</p><p>“Breathing Technique Sovereign Stage Lv.2.” “Breathing Technique Sovereign Stage Lv. 3.”</p><p>“Breathing Technique Holy Emperor Lv.0.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou watched as the Heaven Mending Stone went from being unable to be polished at all to a rapid increase in its skill level. With his natural breath, he could breathe out the majestic power of the Heavenly Ancestor.</p><p>The power of the Heavenly Ancestor that filled his body visibly weakened and the discomfort also decreased gradually.</p><p>“Originally, I might not be able to break away from the image of a sickly young master even after three to five years. Now, I feel like I can digest the power of the Heavenly Ancestor in a month or so.” Xu Xiaoshou was pleasantly surprised.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Even as he had this thought, an explosion sounded in the air, and thunder rumbled on the ground.</p><p>However, there was no saint calamity, which was within Xu Xiaoshou’s expectation.</p><p>After all, the Breathing Technique was equivalent to a mental cultivation technique. If one’s mental cultivation technique reached the Holy Emperor level, it only meant that one’s cultivation speed would increase in the future. It did not mean that one would directly break through to the level of Holy Emperor.</p><p>However, the Holy Emperor’s Lv.0 Breathing Technique was still terrifying!</p><p>At the moment when his level could not be increased, Xu Xiaoshou absorbed the power of the Heavenly Ancestor, but he also passively pulled in the surrounding Heaven and Earth spiritual energy.</p><p>This time, the heaven and earth element no longer ‘roared over’, but were ‘plundered’ on the spot.</p><p>“Meow?”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit who had gone back to the 100,000 alchemy cauldrons and was busy refining the treasures, suddenly froze on the spot.</p><p>Its precious Elixirs were about to take shape. The little ring that Greedy the Cat Spirit hung around its neck was about to receive more precious medicines in its inventory.</p><p>Suddenly, all the Elixirs turned into spiritual energy and disappeared!</p><p>Not only were all the Elixirs in the alchemy cauldrons gone, but the boundless spiritual energy and vitality spiritual energy in the world were also gone!</p><p>The Yuan Mansion world seemed to have turned into a mortal world. It became so ordinary that it couldn’t be any more mundane.</p><p>Even the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer was affected by this transformation.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit was originally asleep, but it was suddenly activated passively. It subconsciously scattered countless golden scales to protect the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>This was its mission.</p><p>If it hadn’t protected them just now, the countless Holy Medicine would have been sucked dry by the mysterious ‘plundering power’.</p><p>“Why was there a change?”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit immediately zoomed in to the location where Xu Xiaoshou had cultivated.</p><p>It didn’t really want to bother too much with the Dragon Apricot fruits. After all, Xu Xiaoshou had also given him dragon blood. It had to put up with the transaction.</p><p>But that didn’t mean that the Dragon Apricot Spirit didn’t know what Xu Xiaoshou had done!</p><p>Merely through his cultivation, he was able to devour the Heaven and Earth spiritual energy in the entire Yuan Mansion world?</p><p>This human had already consumed the Dragon Apricot fruits?</p><p>But there were clearly none!</p><p>That person was just cultivating.</p><p>Even if he swallowed all 99 Dragon Apricot fruits, it would not have produced such an effect…</p><p>Before it had any further thoughts, Xu Xiaoshou opened his eyes and exhaled.</p><p>In an instant, the Yuan Mansion world was filled with boundless spiritual energy!</p><p>Even the life spiritual energy that had accumulated for many months and already condensed into liquid, but had suddenly disappeared, had also returned!</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit was dumbfounded.</p><p>What sort of realm was this?</p><p>Was this still the human kid who struck a bargain with it just now? When he closed his eyes just now, had it been 10,000 years? “Swallowing Heaven and Earth…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was also stunned when he regained his senses.</p><p>The Yuan Mansion world was already incomparably vast. With just a single breath, he was able to circulate the spiritual energy of the world and even refine it?</p><p>This was something only a legendary Saint could do!</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>I now indeed have the Holy Emperor level Breathing Technique…</p><p>After he took a few more breaths, he began to absorb the Heaven and Earth spiritual energy. This time, the Yuan Mansion world around him began to exude an aura filled with the power of the ancestral source.</p><p>Even the Primordial Purple Mist on the Bodhi Root seemed to have grown a little stronger. “Crazy! ”</p><p>“I’m going crazy!”</p><p>As his Perception sensed this, Xu Xiaoshou felt his scalp go numb. His eyes blazed and his breath came out in heavy gasps.</p><p>This energy wasn’t just extracted from Xu Xiaoshou’s body. It was the transformation of the Chaotic Mist in the Yuan Mansion world that his Breathing Technique had devoured.</p><p>Everyone was well aware that Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t even move the Chaotic Mist before. He could only let it dissipate on its own and turn into a clear turbid state.</p><p>Now, he could refine it?</p><p>That thing could even extract the auras of the power of the ancestral source and the Primordial Purple Mist?</p><p>“Me! I’m a humanoid ancestral source, primordial chaos transformation tool?”</p><p>“Doesn’t this mean that I don’t need any Treasure of suppressing barrier after I enter the Yuan Mansion world? As long as I cultivate here, this place will definitely become a paradise?”</p><p>“What about the outside world?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly thought of some seemingly illusory legends.</p><p>It was said that some saints swallowed the world and formed their own grotto-heavens around them. If they cultivated all year round, that place could even become a secret realm in the end.</p><p>“Wait…”</p><p>“Was this how the Holy Emperor’s secret realm was formed?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held his head with both hands and his eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>He was aware that every passive skill would undergo a qualitative change when it reached the level of a Holy Emperor, but the Breathing Technique was a little too exaggerated!</p><p>Just as he fell into deep thought, the Heaven and Earth spiritual energy in his Yuan Mansion world stopped, was refilled, stopped and was refilled again…</p><p>It was as if someone played with the lights in the room at night. One moment it was dark, one moment it became bright…</p><p>After being swallowed and spat out, the Heaven and Earth spiritual energy became even purer!</p><p>This was because its quantity was too little and its quality was too low.</p><p>Once the Yuan Mansion world was formed, or even half-formed, there would be more transformation of the Chaotic Mist into cultivation energy. Once it reached the point, even the Holy Emperor Lv. o Breathing Technique would not be able to devour the energy in one gulp.</p><p>This would mean that the Yuan Mansion world would enter a period of rapid growth, and there would no longer be a shortage of spiritual energy. As long as Xu Xiaoshou continued to cultivate here, the quality of the Heaven and Earth spiritual energy would continue to be purified.</p><p>“And the utmost limit would be the Holy Emperor secret realm?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
