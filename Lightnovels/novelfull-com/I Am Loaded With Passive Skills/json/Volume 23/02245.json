Like Feng Xiao who’s a cause for ridicule?”</p><p>With a swish, everyone’s eyes turned to the outside of the Yougui Pavilion. Even the members of the Ghost God gang couldn’t help but look over.</p><p>Feng Xiao’s face turned red. He covered his ears and almost buried his head in his chest.</p><p>“My brother! ”</p><p>He suddenly raised his head again and regained his energy. He strode into the pavilion and said as he walked.</p><p>“I can’t take it anymore.”</p><p>“But you’re a true disciple of the Burial Sword Tomb. You’ve cultivated the 10 Sections of the Finger Sword and can even hurt Senior Ghostface. How can you be inferior to others with your cultivation level?”</p><p>“Swordsmen of our generation should press forward and fight for the name…You have the potential to be one of the Seven Sword Deity!”</p><p>The sickly young master covered his face with his fan and laughed when he heard that. His eyes were cold. “You’re a defeated opponent. Is it your place to speak here?”</p><p>“I was not defeated by you!” Feng Xiao shouted angrily. He did not want to talk to this useless young master. He looked at his guard again. “You…”</p><p>“There is no need to say anything else. My guard will not leave me… Right?</p><p>Guard.”</p><p>“Yes, sir!” The second true body turned around helplessly and nodded.</p><p>When he saw this, Old Ghostface was furious.</p><p>Such a swordsman actually fell into the hands of such a sickly young master. What kind of hold did he have over him?</p><p>If the Ghost God gang could accept this person…</p><p>He turned his eyes and stared at Feng Xiao who acknowledged it. He then walked over with his head held high. He said seriously, “My brother, I’m not the one who said…”</p><p>“If you didn’t say it, then don’t say it!”</p><p>“Xu Gusheng, shut up! What do you know about the ancient swordsman?” Feng Xiao was really angry now.</p><p>“Oh, then you know a lot about the ancient swordsman?” The sickly young master did not hesitate at all. He walked over, waved his fan and sneered.</p><p>“It was your saber, Twilight, that could not even protect you that made you so accomplished and helped you to understand the ancient swordsman.”</p><p>“Or was it because your cultivation in the Way of the Sword was unparalleled that you dare to talk so loudly in front of me, the successor of the Burial Sword</p><p>Tomb?”</p><p>Feng Xiao’s aura froze, and his face turned pale.</p><p>When he thought about how his saber had been broken by this person’s guard, he was so angry that he wanted to speak up.</p><p>The sickly young master snorted coldly. For some reason, Feng Xiao’s words were stuck in his throat and could not come out.</p><p>All the onlookers who had gathered at the Yougui Pavilion and the passers-by outside the street, stared at him.</p><p>Even Old Ghostface looked at the sickly young master silently. He watched as he strode toward him while his aura rose steadily.</p><p>“I don’t know how the people of the Central Region view the ancient swordsman, how they imitate them in their behavior and dressing.”</p><p>“But I’ve seen the ancient swordsman in the Eastern Region who would risk their entire family just to protect a sword!”</p><p>“Even if we fail, even if we die, even if one or two people in the clan die… A true ancient swordsman would never give up the Dao in his heart.”</p><p>The sickly young master’s eyes glowered as he stared at Feng Xiao, whose face had turned pale and body started to sway. He sneered and said.</p><p>“You are a Sovereign Stage Way of the Sword!”</p><p>“I don’t believe that you didn’t have the ability to protect the sword in the battle just now.”</p><p>“However, in your heart, everyone is much stronger than you. If you cross the line, if you resist, you will die.”</p><p>“Your life mattered more than a sword, you can only howl blindly… A person like you who claimed to be an ancient swordsman is an insult to too many people. Yet you still dare to talk about swords in front of me?”</p><p>The paper fan gently touched Feng Xiao’s trembling face and slowly lifted his chin.</p><p>“Puff!” Feng Xiao’s body was struck by a bolt of lightning, and blood gushed out from his heart. His eyes became unfocused and he spat out blood.</p><p>The sickly young master turned away in time, and with a flick of his folding fan, covered half of his face.</p><p>“Change your path.. You’re not fit to wield a sword!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
