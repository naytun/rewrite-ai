The three-headed, six-armed monster in the sky was bathed in divine light. Just like before, it wanted to crush the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe with one punch.</p><p>“Buzz! ”</p><p>The stone slabs on the long streets in the north, south, east, and west of the Jade Capital City were crushed by the power. However, the Divine Array patterns that had been hidden deep in the ground continued to stay lit up for a long time .</p><p>The capital’s great array was the first to be activated.</p><p>It tried to imprison the giant and isolate him from the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>However, the three-headed, six-armed monster issued a punch in the air that carried with it a destructive power of death. Even the Great Path was shattered.</p><p>The capital’s great array only lasted for ten auras of time…</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The sky seemed to explode with fireworks, and specks of sparkling light scattered everywhere.</p><p>The light of the great array that had exploded intersected in midair again. It formed a spiderweb-like energy that attempted to bind and pull back the monster’s fist.</p><p>With a loud bang, the threads were easily torn apart!</p><p>The monster’s punch seemed slow, but it was due to the distance.</p><p>In reality, his power steadily pushed its way towards the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>All the guardians at the Saint Mountain raised their heads. Without exception, they felt that the world was gradually being filled hv a fist. and there was nothing else in sight.</p><p>“What is this…”</p><p>This thing came too unexpectedly!</p><p>Not long ago, the Saint Mountain had just held a grand meeting. The weather was warm and the sky was clear.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, someone had attacked the Saint Mountain?</p><p>For those who had lived on the Saint Mountain for a long time, this was more unbelievable than the sky collapsing?</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>This extremely powerful fist filled with disaster caused some people to temporarily forget their duty as guardians of the mountain. It was a subconscious action to protect their own lives and avoid disaster.</p><p>However, when they came back to their senses, they stopped in their tracks and injected all their power in an attempt to activate the great array.</p><p>However, as they stared at the fist with trepidation, everyone felt that they awaited their death!</p><p>The great array of the Saint Mountain lit up instantly.</p><p>However, the giant moved, as if he had expected this. Three of its heads stretched out and five of its arms stuck out. Before the formation closed, it forcefully opened a spatial gap.</p><p>His destructive fist reached in through the huge gap.</p><p>“Swish, swish, swish!”</p><p>At the critical moment, nine arrows converged and chased after the clouds!</p><p>Nine consecutive arrows from the Evil Sin Bow were indeed a rarity!</p><p>The last time something like this happened, it was said that a black dragon had escaped from the Eastern Region. Hallmaster Dao then severely injured it with the Nine Arrow Nail Divine Array.</p><p>This time, everyone raised their heads and watched as the nine arrows from the Evil Sin Bow instantly nailed the giant’s three heads and five arms.</p><p>“It’s done?”</p><p>Some people were pleasantly surprised as they watched the giant being impaled. They felt that they had seen hope.</p><p>However, the remaining arrow from the Evil Sin Bow only made contact with the shockwave from the giant’s fist and exploded with a bang.</p><p>“He can’t be nailed down!”</p><p>“Even Lord Cangsheng’s Evil Sin Bow couldn’t block this punch?”</p><p>The target of the God level Shattering Fist was too clear.</p><p>Crush the Saint Hall and all the creatures on the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe that it encountered!</p><p>However, even though Ai Cangsheng’s arrow broke, the remaining eight arrows were extraordinary.</p><p>It controlled the monster’s body for a moment, and then, the illusory but towering nine phase osmanthus tree rose from the outer ring of the Jade Capital City.</p><p>“Nine Sacrificial Osmanthus!”</p><p>Nine different varieties of osmanthus trees rose into the sky and their powers intertwined.</p><p>In an instant, the entire Jade Capital City seemed to be lifted up by the crowns of the ancestral trees and shone with the power of rebirth.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Dragon roars resounded throughout the city.</p><p>The Golden Fate Dragon gathered on the Saint Mountain at the right time. It opened its huge mouth and swallowed the three-headed, six-armed monster, except for one of his arms.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>In the end, the God level Shattering Fist did not really land on the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>After all, that mountain was the center of the continent. There were hidden talents and countless Saint Stage there.</p><p>The arm and the punch that had lost the power of the main body were like rootless duckweed. They were destroyed by the great array of the Divine Light</p><p>Pattern on the Saint Mountain.</p><p>But everyone could see it clearly.</p><p>The energy on the fist took a full 15 minutes to be digested by the great array of the Saint Mountain.</p><p>At this point, everyone heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>There were often people who showed off while they were in the Jade Capital City, but such a scene of stepping on a giant city and the fist attack on the Saint Mountain had only happened twice in decades.</p><p>The last time, it was The Divine, the reckless man among the Ten High Nobles, who had sneaked into the Saint Mountain alone after being provoked and almost climbed the Stairway to Heaven. After being discovered, he was forced to flee in panic by the Saints and had no choice but to hide in the City of the Dead Bodhisattva in order to survive.</p><p>“This punch is a little familiar…”</p><p>Some of the elders felt the fluctuations of the aura in the Jade Capital City and seemed to have recalled something, but they were not completely sure.</p><p>“But he’s still locked up, right?”</p><p>“I heard that Lord Cangsheng kept him under surveillance all the time. How could he come out?”</p><p>“Could it be that this time, it was his descendant?”</p><p>“After so many years, it is indeed possible that he has nurtured a little reckless fellow…</p><p>Changle Street, inside a tea shop.</p><p>Xi’s face was pale. He sat down silently at the table and poured himself a cup of tea.</p><p>He held the teacup but did not drink it in the end. He only poured it on the ground.</p><p>“The Divine!”</p><p>At this point, Xi was able to confirm who the bald burly man who gave him such an overwhelming sense of oppression, was.</p><p>Others might have mistaken him for someone else, but he, as the Chief of the Transformation, would not.</p><p>It was The Divine!</p><p>Did the Divine really come out from the Cross Corner Street?</p><p>Otherwise, other than the brainless him, even Bazhun’an wouldn’t have the guts to charge into the Saint Mountain alone, right?</p><p>“However, if it’s his true body, how could he be so easily devoured by the</p><p>Golden Fate Dragon?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
