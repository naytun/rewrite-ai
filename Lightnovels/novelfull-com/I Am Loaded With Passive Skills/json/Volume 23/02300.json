There was only a name that waited for the host to discover it.</p><p>“Independence…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze landed on the name of the Stealth second awakening.</p><p>This item was really impressive among the other unrefined names such as the Berserk Giant and Exploding Posture.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou awakened this skill without too much thought.</p><p>“Independence!”</p><p>The world in front of him seemed to turn illusory after his shout.</p><p>But in reality, it did not. The scene he saw through his Perception was… Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t even see himself with his Perception!</p><p>He stood alone on the spot and felt isolated from the entire Apricot Realm.</p><p>Even as the Lord of the Apricot Realm, he was unable to mobilize any power in this world or outside the world to target himself in this state of independence.</p><p>“So fast!”</p><p>“This spiritual source is flowing away…”</p><p>It could not even be described as ‘passing by’!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already mastered the Eternal Vitality and High Spirits transformation at the Holy Emperor Lv.o.</p><p>At this moment, the spiritual source in his energy reserve and even the strength in his entire body were rapidly being ‘destroyed’.</p><p>In just a short three breaths of time, nearly sixty percent of his vitality and vigor had been destroyed!</p><p>After a rough calculation, even if the three endurance passive skills were used continuously, in less than ten breaths, his spiritual source would be depleted.</p><p>At the same time, due to the Eternal Vitality, Transformation and other reasons, his physical and mental state would also start to ebb.</p><p>“This spiritual source had been ignited too rapidly!”</p><p>“What exactly was the effect of this Independence? It can’t be that even the Holy Emperor can’t detect me, right? Then there are really too many tricks that can be done…”</p><p>As he felt the rapid decline in his condition, Xu Xiaoshou felt that this speculation was very likely to be true.</p><p>He had an idea and flashed in front of the Dragon Apricot and waved his hand very ostentatiously.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot was asleep.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou started to take off his shirt and revealed his smooth and tender shoulders and his beautiful, seductive flesh. The Dragon Apricot did not make an appearance.</p><p>“No reaction?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t believe it. He put on his clothes and went to the pile of treasures and grabbed a bucket of dragon blood.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot still did not move.</p><p>As long as the ancestor tree trembled now, Xu Xiaoshou would know that it pretended to be asleep.</p><p>But…</p><p>There was really no reaction!</p><p>“Even dragon blood can’t tempt you?”</p><p>“That means that the Ancestor Tree can’t see through the effects of this Independence. At the same time, it won’t be able to detect some of the external objects I’m carrying…”</p><p>“I wonder if humans can also have this Independence?”</p><p>According to the Vanishing Technique, humans might not be able to do it, but if they did not have any spiritual intelligence or any sort of dead objects, they should be able to carry it.</p><p>Ten breaths lapsed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s calculations were very accurate. As expected, he could not maintain the state of Independence and it dispelled on its own.</p><p>His entire body seemed to have been hollowed out in an instant. His eyelids drooped and his eyes were lifeless. Even his mind seemed to be in a trance for a moment.</p><p>“Tired… ”</p><p>As his legs turned soft, Xu Xiaoshou almost fainted.</p><p>However, the three endurance Passive Skills at the Holy Emperor level were extremely powerful.</p><p>In addition, the Breathing Technique was still there. Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath. At least the feeling of being hollowed out was gone, and his energy reserve had a thin bottom to support it.</p><p>“I revived!”</p><p>When his eyes could focus again, Xu Xiaoshou saw that the Dragon Apricot Spirit had appeared out of nowhere and was staring intently at the dragon blood in his hand.</p><p>“Human?”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot’s question was very clear. It was obvious that it was asking if he wanted to repay its blessing just now.</p><p>So it really didn’t notice me just now… Xu Xiaoshou felt excited. He held the dragon blood and asked, “Senior, if you answer my question honestly, I’ll give you this bucket of dragon blood for free.”</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>“Is it possible for the Holy Emperor to use some method to get within thirty feet of you without you noticing?”</p><p>“Impossible!” “Really?”</p><p>“It’s true!”</p><p>“I’m talking about the Holy Emperor, the high level type of Holy Emperor?” “I am the World Tree of the Apricot Realm. Not to mention if it was within 30 feet, even if a spatial fragment was 300,000 feet away from this world, I can still sense it.”</p><p>Then you’re not as powerful as you think you are…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was delighted because the Independence was obviously better than this!</p><p>He planned to find an opportunity to try it out in front of Kong Yuhen and</p><p>Bazhun’an.</p><p>If they didn’t sense him, then belly dancing in front of Dao Qiongcang was a dream that could be realized.</p><p>“Senior, this is yours.”</p><p>Xu Xiashou handed over the dragon blood.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit did not drink it yet. It took it and placed it beside the tree. It probably planned to take its time to savor it in the future.</p><p>It realized that it would really be a waste to gulp down everything at one go, like before…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw how frugal the Dragon Apricot Spirit was with the dragon blood and turned to leave with a smile.</p><p>Within the short span of their conversation, he had recovered to his peak condition.</p><p>Clearly, the spiritual source capacity of a Sovereign Dao Realm expert, even if he lost the concept of the energy reserve and could store the spiritual source in his entire body, was not enough to burn up a second awakening of his passive skill.</p><p>After all, an awakening was very taxing on the spiritual source. Before he broke through to the Sovereign Stage, Xu Xiaoshou had to limit the number of times he could reach the heavens in one step.</p><p>However, the various endurance passive skills at the Holy Emperor Lv.o perfectly made up for this shortcoming.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou concluded.</p><p>“I can activate the second awakening, but I have to turn it off within ten breaths. Otherwise, my state will be drained.”</p><p>“But after about ten breaths, with my passive skills, my condition will be revitalized and I can play again..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
