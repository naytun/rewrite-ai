No, there is no Holy Power fluctuation. Instead, it looks like a…</p><p>Xi pondered over this for a long time, but he couldn’t find a suitable adjective to describe The Divine’s form.</p><p>In the end, the word ‘virtual image’ popped up in his mind, but he quickly shook his head and rejected the idea.</p><p>What a joke!</p><p>As he looked at the completely shattered Changle Street and the corpses of his companions around him, Xi remained silent for a long time.</p><p>He recalled the conversation he had with his Teacher when he learned the sword.</p><p>“Teacher, in the same realm, who can be said to have the strongest combat strength on the continent?”</p><p>“There is no strongest.” “What about you?”</p><p>“I’m not as good as Bazhun’an.”</p><p>“Impossible! But I will take this seriously. If you say so, then Bazhun’an should be the strongest?”</p><p>“He’s not the strongest.”</p><p>“What? Who else could it be? Elder You Tu? Although I’ve never seen him before…</p><p>“No, all the past and present ten generations are inferior to the Ten High Nobles.”</p><p>“So the strongest is from the Ten High Nobles, but is not an ancient swordsman?”</p><p>“No. No one is worthy to get the title of ‘the most powerful combat strength but if I had to choose, then there were three of them of equal rank.”</p><p>“Who were they?”</p><p>“Ling Cao, Eighth Sword, The Divine.”</p><p>Xi was extremely shocked when he heard his answer.</p><p>He still recalled that his Teacher had added after a pause, “If all the restrictions were lifted under the same realm.’</p><p>Xi was aware that these three people had all been restricted, each for their own reasons.</p><p>“At the same realm, who was the strongest among the three after the restrictions were removed?” He asked again.</p><p>He vaguely remembered that his Teacher had thought about it for a long time and said faintly, “Regardless of the other conditions, whoever made the first move would be the strongest.”</p><p>‘Why?”</p><p>“Because the three of them have the ability to instantly kill the other two.”</p><p>Xi didn’t expect that there would be three such geniuses. After he mulled over it for a while, he discovered something a little peculiar and asked.</p><p>“I have another question. Why was the Holy Divine Palace not on good terms with these three? They seemed to be neutral or did they oppose each other?.”</p><p>At that time, his Teacher just laughed and said something that made Xi a little wary.</p><p>“Do you think the Holy Divine Palace doesn’t want to? They can’t do it and can’t afford it.</p><p>“There is no absolute fairness in the world. The fairness of today’s era is only based on the fairness of the majority of the people. The interests of a small number of people would inevitably be sacrificed.”</p><p>“This is the current mode of the Holy Divine Palace. True geniuses will be forced to stand against them, such as the three people mentioned just now.”</p><p>“Just wait and see. There will be prosperity in the short term, but there will be no peace in the long term. When the sleeping lion opens its eyes, there will definitely be disputes.”</p><p>Xi came back to the present and felt that it might be the time when the sleeping lion would be awakened.</p><p>The Divine…</p><p>Godhood called a god at the gates of hell…</p><p>It was no wonder that Hallmaster Dao had said ‘do not’ three times in a row and made it impossible for him to resist that baldy.</p><p>Would he really have died if he had drawn his sword?</p><p>Xi activated the battle communicator in his ear and contacted the leader of the Heavenly Group, Dao Qiongcang. He reported to him directly.</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao, The Divine just asked me to pass on a message…”</p><p>“I’ve heard everything. Retreat first and get your men to stay away from Changle Street. Also, send more men to scout for first-hand information about the City of the Dead Bodhisattva. Remember to get all the details.”</p><p>Eh?</p><p>If that was the case, The Divine had not emerged yet?</p><p>He was still locked up there. The one who had punched the Saint Mountain just now was only a… demi-saint Incarnation?</p><p>Xi was stunned for a moment, but quickly replied, “Okay.”</p><p>Then, he thought about the operation on Changle Street. It would be too trivial to stop the operation because of a punch from The Divine. After all, that guy had not really come out. He asked again.</p><p>“Are we really going to leave Changle Street just like that?”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>Xi instantly felt as if his sword had struck cotton.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao’s ‘Hmm’ nearly caused him to have a heart attack. Xi hesitated for a moment and could not suppress his curiosity.</p><p>“Hallmaster, may I ask…”</p><p>“It would be better for you not to be curious.”</p><p>Xi choked again. However, the more he suppressed it, the more it rebounded. He still said, “Hallmaster, I still want to know what the demi-saint Incarnation could do? Has The Divine already reached the threshold of that realm?”</p><p>“You really want to know?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Then ask one question at a time.”</p><p>“Uh, The Divine is already a Holy Emperor?”</p><p>“Then he is a demi-saint…”</p><p>“Then… what? He is not a demi-saint? Then his demi-saint incarnation just now…”</p><p>“That was a virtual image.”</p><p>Xi touched his ears and froze in place, as if he had been petrified in the tea house.</p><p>He vaguely understood why Hallmaster Dao had said, “You’d better not be curious.”</p><p>“Any more questions?”</p><p>“Yes… No, no, no more…”</p><p>“Since you’re so curious, I’ll tell you more!” A mocking laugh came from the communicator.</p><p>“W-what?”</p><p>“The Divine cultivated ancient martial arts and the virtual image is the ability of a Spiritual Cultivator.”</p><p>“W-what do you mean?”</p><p>“Let me give you an example that you are familiar with. Bazhun’an used conducting alchemy to destroy Jade Capital City’s great array.”</p><p>Pa!</p><p>The teacup suddenly fell to the ground and shattered into several pieces.</p><p>Xi felt that the voice that was transmitted directly to his soul through the battle communicator suddenly seemed very, very far away from him…</p><p>“Work hard, young man.”</p><p>“You have a chance.”</p><p>The communicator ended with a beep.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao’s laughter also faded and the young man was left alone in the tea house.</p><p>“Aunt Xiang, I want to learn ancient martial arts! I really want to!”</p><p>Inside the Yougui Pavilion, the light from the skylight shone on the sickly pale face of the second true body and made his eyes sparkle brightly..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
