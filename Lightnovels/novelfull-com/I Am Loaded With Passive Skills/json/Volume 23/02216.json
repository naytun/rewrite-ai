(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>The spatial crack tore through the void, timely and providential, shielding the embarrassed Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s figure flickered.</p><p>The next moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s voice trembled as he spoke:</p><p>“Boss, not cool!”</p><p>“At least give me back the fingers and wrist before you leave, so I can return them to the owner!”</p><p>“Mmmph.” Lei Xier couldn’t help but giggle, trying to muffle the sound with her hand.</p><p>In that instant, everyone woke up from their “dreams,” staring in terror at her.</p><p>The second true body, as if granted a pardon, turned to stare at her in surprise, as if looking at a savior.</p><p>Even Bazhun’an couldn’t help but glance over.</p><p>Lei Xier’s face froze with a smile, her pretty face turning red, as if blood could drip from her ears.</p><p>“Sorry, I didn’t mean to.”</p><p>She apologized in a trembling voice barely louder than a mosquito.</p><p>As soon as she finished speaking, Lei Xier’s silver hair began to change color, turning black, and her body shrank—she had chosen the invincible escape technique of the same school!</p><p>But halfway through, Lei Xier’s hair color couldn’t change back, and she let out a resistant youthful voice, terrified and sharp:</p><p>“I don’t want to go out!”</p><p>“No, you have to.”</p><p>“Don’t come in!”</p><p>“No, I will.”</p><p>“You laughed on your own; it’s not my business!”</p><p>This final scream came from the usually aloof Lei Xier.</p><p>The situation completely lost control.</p><p>Everyone stared at Xu Xiaoshou, who successfully escaped, then turned to Lei Xi’er, who failed to escape, feeling that the world had become incredibly interesting.</p><p>Bazhun’an took a deep breath.</p><p>Initially indifferent, Bazhun’an knew everyone would pretend not to see it.</p><p>Now, it had become a mess…</p><p>“Enough! Both of you.” Bazhun’an clenched his fist, joints cracking, the corners of his eyes twitching.</p><p>The world instantly returned to silence.</p><p>Lei Xier was stuck halfway, her hair half-silver and half-black, the second true body held his breath, afraid to make a sound.</p><p>Everyone who had been awakened behind them didn’t dare to close their eyes again, as if the shut of their eyelids would make a deafening noise, drawing everyone’s attention.</p><p>Deathly silence spread on Abyss Island.</p><p>Bazhun’an was about to speak again, breaking the silence, indicating his magnanimity and grace in overlooking past grievances.</p><p>The void abruptly cracked open again…</p><p>Very slow.</p><p>Very light.</p><p>As slow as a crawling turtle.</p><p>As if as long as it remained this way, no one could see—everyone with eyes wide open was blind!</p><p>From the spatial crack, a hand emerged silently, gently poking the second true body’s waist.</p><p>Then, into his palm, fingers were inserted one by one.</p><p>The first, the second…</p><p>After inserting the fingers, he proceeded to tuck in that small section of the wrist.</p><p>Eh? Realizing that there wasn’t enough space, the hand quietly moved to the left, discreetly stuffing Bazhun’an’s wrist into the left palm of the second true body…</p><p>Indeed, not a sound was made.</p><p>But under the gaze of everyone, the current silence was deafening.</p><p>“I’ve tolerated you for quite a while now!”</p><p>“Since the Tiansang Spirit Palace, I’ve wanted to kill you!”</p><p>Bazhun’an’s eyebrows suddenly raised, and after a yell, he casually summoned Mei Siren’s fallen fan, turning it into a fierce sword and thrusting forward. “Fine! Kill me! I should die! I don’t deserve to live!”</p><p>The second true body roared, closing its eyes, employing the ultimate killing move—an attempt to use offense as a defense to awaken Bazhun’an’s conscience.</p><p>Bazhun’an, with a good temperament, could tolerate major faults, not to mention that he had promised equality to Xu Xiaoshou, who had just joined the Saint Servant.</p><p>At the last moment, he restrained his force and didn’t vent his anger on this innocent substitute.</p><p>Only then did everyone feel their hearts return to their throats and fall back to their proper places.</p><p>Precisely at that moment.</p><p>After Bazhun’an restrained his power, the folding fan, no longer constrained by power, unfolded on its own.</p><p>This sound was too piercing!</p><p>Louder than the sound of the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation!</p><p>Everyone couldn’t help but turn their heads to look at the paper fan, which was held by Bazhun’an by its end and lifted high.</p><p>On the fan, bold and colorful characters depicted dragons flying and phoenixes dancing, graceful and unrestrained!</p><p>The side that everyone saw was:</p><p>“Easy, easy.”</p><p>What Bazhun’an saw was:</p><p>“Amazing, amazing.”</p><p>Mei Siren’s heart skipped a beat, almost stopping.</p><p>Bazhun’an, like a puppet on a string, turned his head, glancing at the immortal Master Siren.</p><p>The old sword saint had already closed his eyes in advance, with another fan unfurled in front of his face.</p><p>On the fan, vivid characters were written:</p><p>“Sorry.”</p><p>You didn’t mean to either?</p><p>“Ugh,” Bazhun’an grunted, his chest swelling, a hint of crimson appearing at the corner of his lips..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
