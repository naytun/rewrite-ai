He rubbed his chin and began to fantasize.</p><p>“Whatever that was needed to be done has been carried out. Logically speaking, the probability of success should be higher. At the very least, I should be guaranteed a second awakening, right?”</p><p>“If there’s another million, maybe there’ll be a guarantee of success, right?”</p><p>After it heard this, Jin Ren cried and tried to dissuade him. “Boss, it’s impossible for the Awakening Stone to guarantee that. You have to bind it time and again…” “Shut up.”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>Passive Points: 2562552.</p><p>Passive value: 1562552.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not want to listen to the doomed Jin Ren’s nonsense. He used another million Passive Points to exchange for ten Awakening Stones.</p><p>“Hehehe…”</p><p>When Jin Ren heard this maniacal laugh, his heart trembled. In the private room, he closed his eyes in despair and stopped crying.</p><p>“I think we can succeed in the second awakening. Jin Ren, what do you think?”</p><p>“Of, of course.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt encouraged. With a swish, he flashed to the alchemy cauldron, picked up Greedy the Cat Spirit and prepared the set.</p><p>“Can I succeed?”</p><p>“Meow?”</p><p>“Very good. I love you.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou dipped the cat into the medicinal liquid of the alchemy cauldron and then sniffed it.</p><p>How fragrant!</p><p>There was actually a medicinal fragrance!</p><p>He flung it aside and flashed to the front of the Dragon Apricot.</p><p>“Meow!” Only then did Greedy the Cat Spirit react. It felt that it had escaped death and had almost been refined into a meat Elixir.</p><p>“Human?!”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot was also startled by this human’s inhumane methods. It was afraid that this red-eyed thing would also bite it if it lost its mind.</p><p>“Senior Dragon Apricot, can you wish me good luck?” Xu Xiaoshou asked politely.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot shook its slightly dimmer tree crown and said indifferently, “The Apricot Realm was just formed. Its luck is unstable. It would be far better to accumulate it slowly than to use it now.”</p><p>What?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment, then his eyes widened.</p><p>He had just asked casually. He wanted to obtain the blessings of the Ancestral Tree and add an illusion gain.</p><p>When he heard what the Dragon Apricot said, did it really have the ability to increase his luck?</p><p>“Senior Dragon Apricot, can you repeat what you said? You have the ability to increase my luck?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately held his head in his hands and almost called his second true body into his Yuan Mansion to kill him.</p><p>I’m stupid!</p><p>Luck…</p><p>Golden Fate Dragon…</p><p>Wasn’t this something that Rao Yaoyao could summon with her Cang Godhood Sword?</p><p>It was said that the zone where the Holy Divine Palace was located had luck. My new world even has the Dragon Apricot as its guard. How can there be no luck?</p><p>As the Lord of the Apricot Realm, how could he not make use of this power of fate?</p><p>If he used it now, his luck would be gone…</p><p>“However, when I am stronger and my fame is already established, the Apricot Realm would not be discovered for the time being. The luck of this world will accumulate more rapidly…”</p><p>Oh, he would definitely have to fight with the Holy Divine Palace later on to plunder their luck…</p><p>Ah, Rao Yaoyao had died too early. Otherwise, he could have used her. Oh right, where did her Cang Godhood Sword go…</p><p>“Human! Calm down!”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot did not understand what went on in the kid’s mind.</p><p>However, his eyes were so red that they were about to bleed. The overflowing devilish energy on his body meant that this kid’s Dao heart was only one step away from collapse and cultivation deviation.</p><p>There was a swish and when Xu Xiaoshou heard the sound, he closed his eyes and opened them again. His condition was restored to perfection.</p><p>He could control his cultivation deviation, so how could he be controlled by his inner demons?</p><p>“Senior, please wish me good luck!” Xu Xiaoshou lowered his head and said seriously.</p><p>When it saw that the lord of the Apricot Realm had made up his mind, the Dragon Apricot did not say anything else. The Ancestor Tree shook and transformed into an illusory shadow of a golden dragon.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>With a dragon’s roar, the Golden Fate Dragon leaped over and fused into Xu Xiaoshou’s body.</p><p>This was the moment!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly raised his head, and his eyes glowed brightly. He felt that his entire body was filled with power. He could even destroy a Holy Emperor with a single punch!</p><p>The Dragon Apricot was shocked by his behavior.</p><p>However, this human brat was not done with his madness. He raised his head and flew into the sky. With a boom, he transformed into a Berserk Giant again.</p><p>“Destiny is mine!”</p><p>Awakening Stone, Bind, Toss… “Second awakening failed.” “Destiny is definitely with me! ! ” Toss again…</p><p>“Second awakening failed.”</p><p>“F*ck, my fate is up to me, not the Heavens!!!”</p><p>Again!</p><p>“Second Awakening successful.”</p><p>“Stealth Awakening: Vanishing Technique.”</p><p>Stealth Second Awakening: Separated from the world.”</p><p>F*ck!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had transformed into a Berserk Giant, was stunned for a moment when he saw so many messages pop up in the Information Bar.</p><p>In the next second, the Berserk Giant, who had regained his senses, pounced downward like a madman. His huge giant hands hugged the Dragon Apricot and almost uprooted it. He slobbered it in kisses.</p><p>“I love you, Dragon Apricot!”</p><p>“Human?!”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot was stunned.</p><p>What was wrong with this person?</p><p>In the distance Greedy the Cat Spirit meowed softly, its eyes full of resentment.</p><p>Its owner had changed…</p><p>In the past, when he went crazy, he would hug people and kiss them randomly. Now, he was so ridiculous that he even kissed a tree…</p><p>“+(Suffered grief, Passive Points), +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not in the least bothered.</p><p>With the Dragon Apricot’s blessing, he would be able to succeed once out of the three tries for the second awakening.</p><p>The most important thing now was not to see the effect of the so-called ‘independence’, but to seize the time to continue with the second awakening.</p><p>Can’t feel it?</p><p>Then the seven Awakening Stones that he had exchanged would be wasted!</p><p>“Time waits for no man. We can do it again!”</p><p>“Second awakening failed.” “Again!”</p><p>“Second awakening failed.”</p><p>“You f*cking scammer, get lost…”</p><p>“Second awakening failed.” “Oh my God!”</p><p>“Second awakening successful.” “Strengthen Awakened: Berserk Giant..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
