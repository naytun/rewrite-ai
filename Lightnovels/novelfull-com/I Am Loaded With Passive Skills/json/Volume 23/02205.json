(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“Alright, everyone.”</p><p>Everyone was still immersed in the fact that Hallmaster Dao had self-destructed and that Bazhun’an had spoken up.</p><p>The figure on the ruins paused for a moment. Without any sudden or unnecessary thoughts, he held the telepathic communication stone and said again.</p><p>“Thank you for your presence and lives and how you’ve watched my great gift in the void.”</p><p>“Now that the ceremony has ended, you can’t watch the rest, so there’s no need to stay any longer.”</p><p>“I won’t send you off.”</p><p>What did he mean by he would not send them off?</p><p>In the various Saint wars, there were very few people who could still survive.</p><p>Not only did they have extraordinary combat strength, but they also had special life-preservation methods.</p><p>At a glance, in the shattered giant kingdom, there were pieces of corpses’ flesh, floating bodies of spirit souls, higher void levels’ wills… all of those.</p><p>However, those whose human forms were complete were almost invisible.</p><p>At this moment, all those who had survived the disaster trembled in fear.</p><p>What they heard implied that he was going to silence them collectively?</p><p>After they held on until now, they still couldn’t hold on to Bazhun’an’s post-war settlement. Was he not going to let everyone live?</p><p>However, everyone seemed to have overestimated their positions in someone’s heart.</p><p>Ants crawl, die in the Path, and live by the Path.</p><p>Bazhun’an did not take these people seriously at all. He only looked at Water Ghost after he said this.</p><p>“Let’s end this.”</p><p>Water Ghost flipped his palm, and the secondary plane door lit up.</p><p>“Buzz! ”</p><p>Under the ruins of the First Hall of Sins, in the dark palace, the path patterns that belonged to the Spell Forbidden Barrier disappeared bit by bit.</p><p>Suddenly, with a bang, a loud sound exploded under everyone’s feet and a figure flew out.</p><p>It was an exceptionally young man whose entire body was covered in water vapor. His face and naked body were blurred under the water ball. However, when everyone looked up, they only saw another Water Ghost.</p><p>“Water-type Power Upanishad Formation…”</p><p>That’s right, as soon as the young man in the water ball flew out, a dazzling Power Upanishad Formation appeared under his feet.</p><p>The moisture in the air increased and it became extremely humid.</p><p>“Di di da da…”</p><p>Soon, raindrops fell from the sky.</p><p>However, the raindrops were not black in color, but looked like ordinary water.</p><p>Only now did everyone realize who this young man was.</p><p>“Spirit Division Chief, Yu Lingdi!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi had never thought that he would be able to break through the restrictions in the dark palace with his physical strength.</p><p>Once the seal was broken, he flew angrily into the sky. He only wanted to find the man who had dealt him such a heavy blow.</p><p>He couldn’t accept what he had thought of before.</p><p>He desperately needed an affirmative answer from the person involved. But before he received the affirmation, he had more important things to do.</p><p>“I was replaced by him.”</p><p>“That person must have infiltrated the Holy Divine Palace. Who knows, he might even have plotted against Rao Yaoyao and the others…”</p><p>When he thought of this, Yu Lingdi froze in the sky, as if he had been petrified.</p><p>What did he see?</p><p>Everywhere he looked, it was a scene of devastation.</p><p>The ancient buildings of the giant kingdom that were high enough to reach the clouds were no longer there. Only the ruins of the post-war rubble remained.</p><p>If he had not known that he was still in the First Hall of Sins, Yu Lingdi would have thought that he had broken through the seal and accidentally entered an extradimensional space of some ancient battlefield.</p><p>There were corpses, blood, and corrupted holy will all over the place.</p><p>Even the traces of power that were above the demi-saint realm could be clearly heard.</p><p>“This is… the First Hall of Sins?”</p><p>The ancient historical, leisurely and beautiful scenery of the giant kingdom that he saw when he first landed on the island, as well as the image of the ruins at this moment, flashed through his mind, one at a time.</p><p>Yu Lingdi felt as if he had been asleep for a century. When he woke up, everything had changed.</p><p>His Power Upanishad Formation had seeped into the Water of Great Path. Through the water left on Abyss Island, he could see the bleak scenes in all the other directions.</p><p>The shattered Fallen Abyss, the Ghost City of the Netherworld that was upside down, the cracked Saint execution ground, the Sleeping Valley where the mountains and Stone Giants could not be seen, the Blood World that had been split apart by a sword, the dried up Azure Marsh, the Forest of Miracles that had been destroyed, the ruined Desolate Inferno Domain that no longer had any fire, and the First Hall of Sins that had been reduced to rubble under his feet…</p><p>The nine extreme grounds were all gone!</p><p>Did a Saint and Emperor battle take place here?</p><p>Was this still the Outer Island of Abyss Island, the place I’m familiar with?</p><p>Yu Lingdi hovered in the sky for a long time, too stunned to do anything.</p><p>Not far away, Water Ghost saw this and stepped forward. He reached out and pressed his hand against his forehead. After a pause, he flipped his wet hair back and smiled.</p><p>“Long time no see, my child.”</p><p>This voice… Yu Lingdi suddenly turned around and saw the shadowy figure of the man he had glimpsed when he hung on the totem pole in the dream-like saint execution ground.</p><p>It was also because of him that he was sealed the moment he entered the First Hall of Sins. This prevented him from doing anything else.</p><p>He took his place and used his identity as the Spirit Division Chief for his own convenience.</p><p>But this time!</p><p>The figure was no longer blurry, and there was no longer half a golden beast mask to cover it.</p><p>He looked so real as he stood quietly on the other side of the sky. It was the same like when he watched him train outside the martial arts arena when he was a child.</p><p>“Father…” Yu Lingdi had a ferocious expression and it seemed his eyes were about to pop out as he let out a heaven-shaking roar,</p><p>This explosion caused the sound waves to roll out and turned into visible ripples that spread out and almost flipped Bazhun’an over.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could clearly hear the strong and complicated emotions contained in these two words. Anger, resentment, attachment, hatred, longing, suppression, joy, pain…</p><p>“Wow!” Xu Xiaoshou shook his head as his eyes blazed like fireworks..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
