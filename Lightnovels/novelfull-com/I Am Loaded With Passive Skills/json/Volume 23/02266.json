They were caught up in the frenzy of the moment as they raised their arms and chanted.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>When Dao Qiongcang saw this scene, his expression was bland. He sighed slightly in his heart.</p><p>Trust was trust, and intimidation was intimidation.</p><p>Now when he saw that everyone was on high alert, it seemed the Heavenly Group was already established.</p><p>But for some reason.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was still a little worried.</p><p>He didn’t need to use his fingers to do a divination, he knew where the root was-there was no sense of tension!</p><p>The Saints around him weren’t stupid.</p><p>On the contrary, as long as they used their brains, they were all very smart. Otherwise, they would not have been elected to the Council of Ten.</p><p>However, as long as he Dao Qiongcang was present at the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, the people around him would not be nervous unless the enemy attacked the foot of the mountain.</p><p>It was also at this moment that Dao Qiongcang realized this.</p><p>Absolute trust could also become a disease. It was a strange disease that was caused by excessive dependence and self-awareness.</p><p>Was there a cure for this disease…</p><p>Dao Qiongcang pinched his glabella. He glanced at Ai Cangsheng, who sat in</p><p>the wheelchair, and took out a jade scroll. He handed it to the Ninth Divine</p><p>Priest.</p><p>“You make the announcement.”</p><p>“Alright, you rest first.”</p><p>The spiritual physique of the Ninth Divine Priest was like a kind mother, who looked at the little child with doting and gratified eyes.</p><p>However, when she turned to face the people at the Saint Hall, she exuded a solemn aura.</p><p>“Next, I will announce the new Chiefs of the six divisions.</p><p>Everyone’s heartbeats accelerated and their blood churned with excitement.</p><p>This is it… Wang Dachui looked up. He was shocked by the methods that Hallmaster Dao and Ai Cangsheng used to reverse the decadent atmosphere. He was confused about his future.</p><p>“Chief of the Physique Division, Wang Dachui. He will take up this position temporarily to atone for his mistakes and make his contributions. He will join the Heavenly Group and directly accept the orders of Hallmaster Dao.”</p><p>The crowd broke out in an uproar.</p><p>But this was something that everyone could imagine.</p><p>Wang Dachui had led the Physique Division for many years, and his abilities were there for all to see. It was impossible for him to be dismissed.</p><p>“Listen up!”</p><p>Heavenly Group…</p><p>This was the difficult part.</p><p>This time round, how many people would lose their lives?</p><p>Wang Dachui sighed in his heart after he received this reprieve.</p><p>He had followed Rao Yaoyao all the way at Yunlun and had heard her exchanges with the think tank. Wang Dachui didn’t think that Rao Yaoyao was as bad as Ai Cangsheng made her out to be.</p><p>However, there was nothing he could do to resist now. He could only believe in Hallmaster Dao, even though he didn’t know how great the leadership gap between Dao Qiongcang and Rao Yaoyao was…</p><p>“Chief of the Transformation Division, Xi, join the Heavenly Group and receive the orders of the Hallmaster.’</p><p>“Yes.” A ghostly shadow appeared in front of the members of the</p><p>Transformation Division, then it condensed into a masked person with a very young voice.</p><p>Everyone immediately turned and looked over in curiosity.</p><p>Xi had been famous in the Saint Mountain recently.</p><p>The Chief of both the Dark Division and the Transformation Division. When he was in action, he had slashed a higher void with his sword. His attainments in the Phantom Swords Technique were so high that he was recognized by the</p><p>Feng family of the Southern Region. He was listed as a candidate for the new Seven Sword Deity.</p><p>What mattered most was that this was a young man!</p><p>Before this, only one of the Chief of the six divisions, Yu Lingdi, had a battle record that was comparable to Xi’s!</p><p>However, the dual duty Chief had become the head of only one division That empty seat… Everyone was filled with anticipation.</p><p>“Dark Divsion Chief, Nian, join the Heavenly Group and receive the orders of Hallmaster Dao.”</p><p>“Accept the order.” A graceful figure descended from the sky. Her voice was crisp and clear, and she had an alluring figure. There was a dagger at her waist, and her appearance was extremely ordinary.</p><p>Nian?</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>Even the members of the Dark Division were stunned.</p><p>There’s such a person in our team? This was too mystifying!</p><p>However, this was an announcement, not a discussion, not a question or a challenge. They would have to wait until later to see if the new Chief could suppress the people under her.</p><p>At that moment, no one dared to object.</p><p>“Combat Division Chief, Fangfang, join the Heavenly Group and receive the orders of Hallmaster Dao.</p><p>With a loud thud, the sky seemed to have been smashed by a huge boulder, and the floor was almost shattered.</p><p>Wang Dachui couldn’t help but turn and looked sideways, as if his old comrade Teng Shanhai had come back to life.</p><p>But that was not the case.</p><p>When the boulder cracked open, it indeed transformed into a burly man in the Cang God Armor who was no less than Teng Shanhai. He had a full beard.</p><p>However, he was extremely shy. Under everyone’s gaze, he clamped his legs that were as thick as rocks slightly, scratched his head shyly, shook a little, and replied in a mosquito-like tone.</p><p>“I, I accept the order…”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Wang Dachui’s eyes instantly turned red, and he breathed heavily through his nose. His toes dug into his shoes, and his hands gripped the sledgehammer that was strapped on his back, tightly.</p><p>In the end, he didn’t dare to act in a rash manner. He couldn’t pull out his big hammer and batter this bashful sissy to death.</p><p>He realized that he and this Combat Division really did not get along!</p><p>What kind of person was the new Chief who was chosen? Could such a person have any combat strength?</p><p>NO!</p><p>Not to mention combat strength.</p><p>This kind of image would cause damage to the Holy Divine Palace, right?</p><p>“Do, do we need to introduce ourselves?” The bashful big man Fangfang timidly said. His voice was very low, but it rumbled like thunder.</p><p>The Ninth Divine Priest’s eyes went blank for a moment. She felt that the world had turned blurry and she had forgotten about the following process for a moment. She subconsciously said.</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>“My name is Fangfang. I’m sixteen this year…”</p><p>“That’s enough.” After the Ninth Divine Priest reacted, she decisively skipped this part and shifted her slightly shocked gaze away. She made the next announcement.</p><p>“Spirit Division Chief, Ao Sheng. Join the Heavenly Group and receive the orders of Hallmaster Dao.</p><p>“Ao Sheng received the order.”</p><p>A handsome young man descended from the sky.</p><p>Everyone finally recovered from the chills they felt when they faced Fangfang. They looked at the new Spirit Division Chief and exchanged glances.</p><p>“Ao Sheng, he’s back?”</p><p>“This is exciting! I thought that either Yu Lingdi would return to the mountain or the Spirit Division would start a new battle to select the person. I didn’t expect him to return.”</p><p>“Back then, during the selection of the Spirit Division Chief, although this troublemaker had completed his mission, he had disobeyed the orders of Hallmaster Dao, right? I didn’t expect to be able to return today.”</p><p>“No, I heard that it’s an inside story. The son of the great Demon King Yu MO was not bad, so naturally, the position of the Spirit Division Chief could only belong to him alone. Then, some people would have to leave.”</p><p>“Ha ha, he has returned. It is time to take back everything that belonged to him…”</p><p>“Pfft! Stop fooling around, but I already know the first mission of the Spirit Division is to kill Yu Lingdi!”</p><p>This high-spirited young man held his head high and thrust his chest out as he basked in the attention. His eyes blazed like the sun.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked at him.</p><p>He looked at the demi-saint and did not flinch.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang snorted coldly.</p><p>Ao Sheng’s chest shook, and his cheeks bulged. His expression returned to normal, but he did not avert his gaze.</p><p>“Little chap, you really dare…” Nian, the average-looking Dark Division Chief stared at the young man with interest. He licked his lips and clearly smelled blood.</p><p>The Ninth Divine Priest ignored all of this, and her tone softened as she announced.</p><p>“Path Division Chief, Yu Zhiwen. Join the Heavenly Group and receive the orders of Hallmaster Dao..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
