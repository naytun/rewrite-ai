After his many failed attempts to arrest Sleeveless, he was ostracized. Without sufficient evidence, he could only mobilize his subordinates, the white-clothed people.”</p><p>“But this should be enough!”</p><p>Aunt Xiang shook her head and sneered, as if she scoffed at Gou Wuyue’s stubbornness and his lack of worth.</p><p>“When Sleeveless arrived at He Ting Mountain, there was blood everywhere on the mountain. Corpses were strewn on the ground, and there were broken weapons everywhere.”</p><p>“Old Gou only found out after he went up the mountain that the ‘Sleeveless’ he was about to deal with was not just the few people who besieged him, but an enormous organization called Fen Qin.”</p><p>“Sleeveless was the leader of the Lord of Darkness of the underground world, Fen Qin. He was also one of the Five Evil Guys – Fen Qin Zhu He!”</p><p>“The headquarters of Fen Qin that was hidden in He Ting Mountain alone had more than ten thousand people. They were all intelligence agents and elites. As for those who have spread out to hide in the five domains of the continent, no one even knew how many there were!”</p><p>“On the surface, He Ting Mountain only had the Five Evil Guys. They battled with people daily and drove them off. This was so boring.”</p><p>“All the big and small matters that took place in the gray area and underground dark faction of the Central Region would be secretly transmitted to He Ting Mountain. After they received the approval from the Fen Qin headquarters, they would then be sent out.”</p><p>“Fen Qin was an invisible giant monster. It laid at the feet of the emperor, but it still brazenly sent out first-hand information to the Saint Servant.”</p><p>“Its existence directly propped up the idealistic pavilion of the Saint Servant. It led them out of the desert ridge in the west, established the Half-Moon</p><p>Residence in the south, infiltrated the Heavenly Covenant in the north, and established the Fringe Moon Immortal City in the east, that was on par with the ancient swordsman’s faction like the Burial Sword Mound for decades!”</p><p>“Even after Fen Qin disintegrated, the Storyteller only ate the scraps. His ‘teahouse’ in the Central Region lasted until recently before it collapsed.</p><p>“As for my Yougui Pavilion, Fen Qin had already taken a portion of it, but it can’t even be considered a scratch. It had already reached its current state.”</p><p>When Aunt Xiang talked about this, there was only deep respect in her peach blossom eyes.</p><p>She wasn’t afraid of Bazhun’an because she knew Yue Gongnu, but she was a little afraid of the Straw Hat Old Man who was almost invincible.</p><p>There was not much of a difference in age between them, but the reason why the old man looked older was all because of his hard work.</p><p>To be able to torture a higher void Elixir Master to such an extent, one could imagine how much more important Sleeveless’ mission was compared to hers!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p>He finally understood why that little bald old man was seated firmly in the position of second-in-command saint servant.</p><p>It could be said that the Saint Servant was like an unsharpened sword without Bazhun’an, but without Elder Sang, it was not even a sword!</p><p>“No wonder that d*mned old man was the only one who dared to disagree with Bazhun’an. I thought that he was just being pretentious…”</p><p>“I thought that he was really just a Saint Servant who entered in chronological order and took the second-in-command position…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amazed.</p><p>Suddenly, he thought of the night of his apprenticeship, and of the ‘Qiu Long Words’ that Elder Sang had told him as he pointed to Goose Lake.</p><p>At that time, I thought it was nonsense.</p><p>At this moment, the memory of that shocked him.</p><p>Indeed, if Elder Sang was such a simple person, would he be able to point at a lake and say such profound words?</p><p>Now that he thought about it, it was simply the most incisive comment on the current situation of the continent!</p><p>Not only did he dare to say that, he also dared to do so.</p><p>He was so brazen that even the Ruler of the white-clothed people was tasked to kill him.</p><p>He had almost single-handedly trapped the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe in the world of the lake he had created. This allowed his enemies to enjoy the ‘prison justice’, yet unable to see the overall picture!</p><p>“What a pity. It was so close. It’s all that foot-washer’s fault…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought that that guy had rotten timing… he just happened to be there just when Gou Wuyue went to the mountain to pay his respects.</p><p>This ablution did not just wash away the dirt on his feet, it washed away at least a hundred years of history on the Shengshen Continent!</p><p>“So what’s next? How was the progress after Sleeveless’ arrival?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>Aunt Xiang laughed silently. “The rest is a combination of all the versions you’ve heard of. Sleeveless versus Old Gou. They fought till the sky darkened.”</p><p>“Actually, he only came in the middle of the match. Old Gou lost his trust, so it was difficult to mediate. He wasted too much time.’</p><p>“When he arrived, the other three old men were still engaged in a bloody battle, but they were not able to turn the tide.”</p><p>“The situation was already hopeless. His best course of action at that time was to use the small world to protect most of the intelligence personnel. He took advantage of the time when the three old men fought against Old Gou to retreat quickly so that he could make a comeback.</p><p>“He won’t retreat!” Xu Xiaoshou shook his head.</p><p>Elder Sang might seem a little heartless to outsiders… Oh, it wasn’t ‘seem to be’, it was a definite ‘yes’. However, the Infernal lineage had this tendency to protect their own.</p><p>He could save so many people on He Ting Mountain, but he couldn’t save his three brothers?</p><p>Most likely, the final development of the story would be that Elder Sang fought with Gou Wuyue alone, and the three brothers protected the rear and retreated with the elite troops.</p><p>“You should have guessed it. Sleeveless, who was also your Master Sang Qiye, didn’t run away and chose to challenge Old Gou.”</p><p>“That battle was indeed earth-shattering. The spiritual energy of He Ting Mountain couldn’t be restored for decades. It was completely reduced to a mediocre mountain. It was the first battle below the demi-saint realm.’ “But there was still no winner or loser. It’s just that hopeless.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang clapped her hands and then spread them out. She said helplessly.</p><p>“The two of them and their sides had suffered heavy losses again. This time, it’s even worse.”</p><p>“Your Master fought his way out of an army of ten thousand. Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand became famous throughout from this battle. He almost crippled Old Gou that caused his sanctification to be delayed indefinitely..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
