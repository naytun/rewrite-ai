He must have fooled Dao Qiongcang and the others and made them think that he was the one who created the fluctuations. In any case, he would only blame it on Kong Yuhen. After all, if the sky falls and the tall fellow held it up, if they don’t get into trouble, then who would?”</p><p>“Hiss, but when I think about it, I just walked at the Gates of Hell!”</p><p>“If the inter-spatial wheel had recorded the traces of the battle, that Elder Dao the Flamboyant might have some way to deduce that I was also at the Central Region…”</p><p>At the thought of this, Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts calmed down and his heart tightened again.</p><p>When you realize that your disguise was about to be seen through by a smart person, there is a high chance that you don’t have to be in disguise anymore.</p><p>“Don’t tell me I’ve already been exposed?”</p><p>Time suddenly became so critical.</p><p>Even The Divine’s strength did not make Xu Xiaoshou feel so anxious. He could not wait to continue to cheat.</p><p>“I can’t fool around anymore. If I delay any longer, more things might happen.</p><p>I won’t even have time to increase my points.”</p><p>“I’m a troublemaker!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was aware of the situation. The appearance of the Apricot Realm this time was very unexpected and within reason.</p><p>He quickly sought his original intention to enter the Yuan Mansion and returned to his inventory.</p><p>Passive Points: 4562552</p><p>“500,000 for one Holy Emperor skill. I still have seven skills that I haven’t used yet. 5, 7, 35…”</p><p>“Recoil, Transformation, Stealth, Sharpness, Toughness, Cooking Expert,</p><p>Drawing Expertise, that’s all.”</p><p>“One million left, or do you want to try a new game?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought for a moment. There was a high chance that he would have to face a Saint during the operation in the Central Region. There would probably be many more.</p><p>“I already have enough output, so I don’t need that much for now. I’m just going to use it where it is most needed.”</p><p>“But there aren’t enough for me to escape, and there aren’t enough to save my life. That is the key.”</p><p>“If it’s a Holy Emperor level combination skill of Stealth and Transformation, combined with the Hidden Sword Technique, can I turn into a stone in the blink of an eye and hope that Dao Qiongcang would ignore me?”</p><p>Holy Emperor Lv.o, that was also the demi-saint level, being under the nose of Dao Qiongcang, who was also a demi-saint… It would be difficult to stay hidden!</p><p>However, Holy Emperor Lv. o was still considered to have reached the level of the Holy Emperor, not like the demi-saint Lv.10. If the Stealth could render a slight effect of forgetfulness… Passive Points: 4562552</p><p>Passive Points: 3562552</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not think about it any more and chose to be reckless!</p><p>Life and death would happen in a matter of seconds. As long as there was a chance, he had to seize it, even if it was just in case.</p><p>If he didn’t level up now, he wouldn’t even be worthy of this ‘just in case’ opportunity.</p><p>“Transformation Sovereign Stage Lv.2” “Transformation Sovereign Stage Lv.3” “Transformation Holy Emperor Lv.o.”</p><p>There was a loud bang in the Apricot Realm.</p><p>The moment this qualitative change appeared, Xu Xiaoshou could feel that his essential form had changed, as if he had become chaotic.</p><p>Infinity.</p><p>However, he was originally everything, and he could transform into everything.</p><p>Once the shackles of the Holy Emperor Lv.o were broken, this passive skill seemed to be free of all restrictions.</p><p>My body is unrestrained!</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>With a thought, Xu Xiaoshou turned into a wisp of Primordial Purple Mist. Its form and aura were exactly the same as those in the Apricot Realm.</p><p>“F*ck, what if I get eaten while in this form? Will there be the effect of the Primordial Purple Mist?”</p><p>Just do it!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou split half of the Primordial Purple Mist.</p><p>The other half transformed into its original human form, then opened its bloody mouth and swallowed the Primordial Purple Mist that he had transformed with an arm.</p><p>“No reaction…”</p><p>“As expected, everything else can be the same, but there are still some differences…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought that it was a pity. After he swallowed the Primordial Purple Mist, he could only give up the idea to use the Eternal Vitality to regenerate his arms and then swallow the Primordial Purple Mist.</p><p>Stealth Sovereign Stage Lv.2.</p><p>Stealth Sovereign Stage Lv.3.</p><p>Stealth Holy Emperor Lv.o.</p><p>Thunder rumbled again across the Nine Heavens.</p><p>He switched recklessly to another passive skill. This time, nothing happened.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought for a moment and called out in his mind, “Invisible, Invisible!” He then swaggered past Greedy the Cat Spirit who was at the alchemy cauldron.</p><p>“Chi! Chi!”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit seemed to have sensed something. It raised its feline head and then lowered it again before it secretly ate the Elixirs.</p><p>After it took two more bites, it suddenly remembered something. It turned its head twice and looked straight ahead in panic.</p><p>“Meow?”</p><p>Just now, it seemed to have seen its owner?</p><p>When he was in his disappearing state, Xu Xiaoshou was completely certain that his presence in this world was equivalent to zero unless he could see it with the naked eye.</p><p>“Then, if these passive skills are at the Holy Emperor level, will the corresponding Berserk Giant and Vanishing Technique skills also increase?” Xu Xiaoshou thought of this question.</p><p>After all, as he grew, his Vanishing Technique also started to run out.</p><p>When The Divine dragged him out, he had felt that he could not avoid this problem anymore and had to face it head-on.</p><p>However, at this moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up. He recalled a special situation that happened in the past when he was in the midst of adding points.</p><p>“I remember that I can have a second awakening, right?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
