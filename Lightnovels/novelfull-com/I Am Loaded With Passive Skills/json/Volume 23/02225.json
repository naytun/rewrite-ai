(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Elder Han subconsciously jumped up from Lei Xi’er’s head, then bowed deeply.</p><p>“Join… ”</p><p>Lei Xi’er grabbed hold of it and it finally stopped its cries.</p><p>Such reverence was deeply rooted within its being and could not be changed.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou saw the scene before him, he was both fascinated and shocked.</p><p>He realized that he seemed to have made a mistake.</p><p>Even if the ghost beasts from the Inner Island were released, would they really dare to mess around?</p><p>Fear was engraved in their bones. Even if Bazhun’an died and only a piece of his skin was left, if it was placed on a chair for them to see, all the ghosts beasts would probably immediately submit due to their fear.</p><p>It was indeed difficult to truly conquer the people’s will with force.</p><p>However, absolute force seemed to lead to another outcome…</p><p>“Every time you see Bazhun’an on the Inner Island, you have to do the same, without any exception?”</p><p>“What about the Third Ancestor of the White Vein and the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon?”</p><p>“They don’t have to worship him, but they have to bow.” “Is Bazhun’an really that powerful in your eyes?”</p><p>“He is a God.”</p><p>The sword cognition invaded the secondary plane door forcefully and directly.</p><p>Soon, the secondary plane door quivered and chose to submit. Bazhun’an was enveloped by a mysterious light.</p><p>It was as if he had truly become a God. Under the guidance of the light, he slowly floated in the air.</p><p>“Dispel.”</p><p>Bazhun’an was not immersed in the power of this external object. He uttered a word calmly and a huge mouth split open in the sky.</p><p>It was a big door.</p><p>It was the gate to the Inner Island.</p><p>The countless black chains that were entwined around it contained the power of the Holy Emperor. They were clearly very tenacious, but they rapidly disintegrated.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>In just a moment, the dusty gate suddenly opened and the roars of the ghosts beasts that were so close to them came from inside. They were filled with high-pitched excitement.</p><p>At this moment, all the existences on the Inner Island knew that Bazhun’an plan had been completed and Abyss Island was within their grasp.</p><p>“Welcome, Lord Bazhun’an!”</p><p>“Welcome, Lord Bazhun’an!”</p><p>Through the huge secondary plane door, the people from the Outer Island could see the scenery of the Inner Island.</p><p>Dust billowed about on the desolate yellow sandy ground that was filled with an ancient aura. Giant beasts lined up in two rows in an orderly manner as they bowed and waited on both sides of the huge door.</p><p>Some of them were very tall and towered into the clouds, some were only the height of a human knee, some had three heads and six arms, and some had wings that covered the sky.</p><p>They were all restricted!</p><p>They were all under great constraint!</p><p>The light of power from the secondary plane door was about to disappear from Bazhun’an after the contract ended.</p><p>“Black Dragon.” Bazhun’an called out softly.</p><p>A loud and clear dragon roar sounded from inside the secondary plane door. Suddenly, the sky outside darkened, and a part of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s dragon body emerged.</p><p>This time, it didn’t look at Xu Xiaoshou. Instead, it lowered its dragon head and held the unstable Bazhun’an. Then, it shrank back and seemed about to welcome him into the Inner Island.</p><p>“The passageway between the Inner and Outer islands has been completely opened…” When he saw this, Xu Xiaoshou could not help but look at Water Ghost. It was so easy to get through?</p><p>Water Ghost knew what was on Xu Xiaoshou’s mind and he replied softly.</p><p>“In fact, Abyss Island doesn’t need to descend on the Shengshen Continent at all. The Holy Divine Palace had no time to intervene and interfere with our operation.”</p><p>“Bazhun’an could have communicated with the Inner Island long ago, after we obtained the secondary plane door.”</p><p>“The saint calamity, the Emperor’s Tribulation, and other powers that were connected to the Inner and Outer islands could also be replaced by other powers.”</p><p>“But this was unnecessary. It’s to partially clip the wings of the Holy Divine</p><p>Palace here. If we’re lucky, we can even lock up a part of the power of a Holy Emperor that we didn’t know about before.”</p><p>Water Ghost smiled and continued.</p><p>“At that time, the plan was so high up in the clouds that no one believed it.</p><p>They only yielded to force and cooperated. Now, it had all come true.”</p><p>“Therefore, everything you see now is what Bazhun’an deserved. The Inner</p><p>Island ghosts beasts were far less respectful than they are now.”</p><p>Apart from everything else, when he saw how the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon who had just heard the call ‘Black Dragon’ and rushed out to welcome</p><p>him, Water Ghost felt sad.</p><p>He knew how arrogant the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was. Even when</p><p>Bazhun’an rode on it, it couldn’t help but struggle.</p><p>Now…</p><p>Ha, it could only be due to Bazhun’an!</p><p>“Wait a moment.” As he stood on the dragon’s head, Bazhun’an, who had disappeared into the secondary plane door, said this to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Soon, as the world dimmed, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon disappeared, and the secondary plane door also disappeared. The world returned to its peaceful state.</p><p>It was as if nothing had happened.</p><p>All of a sudden, a thunder-like sound came from the clouds.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>On the flat ground, smoke rose three feet off the ground, and the birds scattered about in fright.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s vision went black. He experienced the same feeling as before when he drew the Sword Technique Expertise back then. His soul had escaped into another world..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
