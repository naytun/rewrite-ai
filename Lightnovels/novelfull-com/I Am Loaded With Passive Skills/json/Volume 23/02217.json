(1)</h1><p>Chapter 2217: Call Me If There’s Anything, Eldest Senior Brother! (1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio     Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>In the shadow of the recent ordeal, how that agonizing period had passed remained unknown to everyone.</p><p>Some things that had shattered within their hearts were irreparable, unable to be restored.</p><p>To the extent that it was unbearable to face!</p><p>Yet, everyone tacitly chose to forget a certain memory.</p><p>Until a figure, unfamiliar to all, appeared in everyone’s sight.</p><p>“Friends, all matters have concluded. Why do you still look so anxious?”</p><p>It was a handsome and refined young scholar who emerged from the ruins, carrying himself with a leisurely demeanor as if strolling in his own backyard.</p><p>“Brother Anxiety?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had returned from Yuan Mansion, turned around sharply upon hearing the familiar voice, finding joy in his heart.</p><p>Now was the time for an outsider to break the awkward silence. He evidently possessed the weight and power to make everyone forget the recent events.</p><p>The nervousness Xu Xiaoshou once felt when facing Kong Yuhen alone had dissipated after multiple encounters, as he came to realize Kong Yuhen was a friendly person.</p><p>“Who?” Xiao Kongtong was alarmed, as moments ago, he hadn’t sensed any presence nearby.</p><p>“Who is Brother Anxiety?” Zhu Yike also looked puzzled. However, the scholar, from disappearance to appearance, seemed to be completely out of this world.</p><p>If he hadn’t spoken, Zhu Yike might have almost overlooked him!</p><p>“What kind of ability is this?”</p><p>The individual seemed to have existed and yet not; it was as if he had arrived, and yet not truly.</p><p>He set foot in this world, but his figure appeared as if it were a projection from ancient times. In the current conversation, he made it feel like communication from the past.</p><p>The vastness of space and time converged in this silhouette.</p><p>Now, if Brother Anxiety had been a projection of the Great Path of Space-Time Rules, Zhu Yike would have believed it.</p><p>“I am Kong Yuhen. It’s my pleasure to meet you, my friends.” The scholar bowed with courtesy.</p><p>Kong Yuhen?</p><p>Mei Siren was the first to look at him in surprise.</p><p>He knew Kong Yuhen, but the face in his memory didn’t seem to match the person before his eyes.</p><p>Upon careful recollection…</p><p>Memories had become blurry!</p><p>The only trace related to Kong Yuhen that Mei Siren could recall was the fake appearance Xu Xiaoshou had imitated when impersonating him.</p><p>It didn’t resemble him at all!</p><p>“You’re Kong Yuhen?”</p><p>Zhu Yike, well aware that he had no right to speak in this situation, couldn’t help but exclaim.</p><p>Kong Yuhen, the one who wandered drunkenly in the moonlight, half caring for the mortal world and half for the vast coldness?</p><p>Among the Ten High Nobles, he was rumored to have only revealed his face once, with no records of him in the world.</p><p>Having witnessed figures like Dao Qiongcang and Bazhun’an in the Abyss Island endgame, Zhu Yike thought he had seen it all.</p><p>However, he didn’t expect to encounter someone even more mysterious in the form of Kong Yuhen!</p><p>Wasn’t he supposed to be in that tower?</p><p>Visible only to those destined to cross his path?</p><p>was ne also destined to see</p><p>“If you are referring to me, then it should be me.” Kong Yuhen looked at Zhu Yike with benevolent eyes.</p><p>Without distinguishing between high and low or noble and humble, he answered the question sincerely.</p><p>Afterward, his gaze shifted to Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>“Friend, you seem very anxious.”</p><p>Upon hearing this familiar voice again, Xu Xiaoshou, who no longer felt anxious himself, was now stirred by his words.</p><p>But this time, Kong Yuhen wasn’t talking to him. Instead, he was addressing Xiao Kongtong…</p><p>In Brother Anxiety’s eyes, it seemed that Xiao Kongtong was the most anxious among them.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s expression remained unchanged, but there was a hint of vigilance in his eyes. However, since this person approached with kindness, he responded with a respectful greeting:</p><p>“I’ve met the senior.”</p><p>Kong Yuhen didn’t dwell on the title of “senior” and said with a smile: “Your heart is not here. Speak the truth and hasten your return.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at this person and felt that he had rushed out hastily.</p><p>He needed a stall, a signboard that read “Divine Fortune-Telling,” or perhaps even bring along that tower of his; sitting inside and uttering these words would be more fitting.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s eyes tightened upon hearing this, and he glanced somewhat awkwardly at Bazhun’an, as if his inner thoughts had been exposed.</p><p>Observing this, Xu Xiaoshou furrowed his brows and it immediately dawned on him.</p><p>After Kong Yuhen brought it up, he realized that following the conclusion of Abyss Island, everyone’s spirits were generally high, except for Xiao Kongtong, who appeared the most despondent.</p><p>In their exchanges, conversation merely grazed the surface, with evident signs that his mind was elsewhere.</p><p>Previously, he hadn’t paid attention, but now, looking back, it made sense:</p><p>The overall situation on the Abyss Island had ended, the Holy Divine Palace had suffered a complete defeat and retreated to the mainland.</p><p>Yet, at this juncture, the war wouldn’t come to a halt. They were likely already strategizing their next move.</p><p>If the next round wasn’t on the Abyss Island, and the Saint Servant had surfaced, it would likely be a reversal of roles…</p><p>The enemy was in the dark, while they were in the light!</p><p>This time, it was the Saint Servant who needed to respond to Dao Qiongcang’s call!</p><p>In the previous battle, Xiao Kongtong had exposed his identity as the Eldest Senior Brother of the Fringe Moon Immortal City.</p><p>Although Eighth Palace’s Gou Wuyue had some suspicions, there was no concrete evidence to act against a significant faction like the Fringe Moon Immortal City.</p><p>Now, Dao Qiongcang had more than enough reasons!</p><p>The Fringe Moon Immortal City, the entire Eastern Moon Realm, and even the swordsmen who worshiped Bazhun’an in that area would likely face a brutal aftermath after the war.</p><p>In other words, by staying a moment longer on Abyss Island, Xiao Kongtong increased the danger to his base.</p><p>In such a situation, how could he not be anxious? How could he not be worried?</p><p>“I…” Xiao Kongtong hesitated, his expression complex.</p><p>He hadn’t seen his teacher for a long time, and there were many things he wanted to say and many questions he wanted to ask.</p><p>For decades, apart from missions and actions, when did opportunities for such face-to-face “fun” present themselves?</p><p>Xiao Kongtong found even his teacher’s face to be strangely unfamiliar.</p><p>This opportunity, for him, was truly rare!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
