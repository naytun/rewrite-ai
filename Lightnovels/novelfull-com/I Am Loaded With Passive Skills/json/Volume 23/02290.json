Were all the people surnamed Xu in the Eastern Region so powerful?</p><p>Xi thought of the Seven Sword Deity Xu Xiaoshou and wanted to dig out more detailed information about him.</p><p>At this moment…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Xi’s heart skipped a beat and his pupils constricted as he abruptly stood up.</p><p>He looked around and found that everyone there were equally startled as they clutched their chests in fright.</p><p>The rest of the people in the teahouse fell to the ground, and hundreds of people on the long street went limp in an instant.</p><p>At the same time, everyone’s strength was inexplicably sucked dry!</p><p>“What sort of spiritual technique is this?” Xi was shocked.</p><p>He clearly did not sense any fluctuations from any Saint Martial Arts spiritual technique at the surroundings, not even a trace.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Just as he was in deep thought, a burly beast fell from the sky…</p><p>NO!</p><p>This was a person who had suddenly dropped from the sky!</p><p>He had an arrogant posture and a fierce look in his eyes. His right foot was deeply embedded in the shattered ground, his left foot was bent as he trod on a head. His left elbow was casually placed on his knee. His fingertips held on to an inter-spatial wheel…</p><p>An inter-spatial wheel?</p><p>Xi’s mind went blank as he looked down.</p><p>Under the huge beast’s butt was the bloody corpse of a member of the Transformation Division.</p><p>Xi Laosan…</p><p>That Xi Ah Cheng, who was about to get married, had been killed?</p><p>Xi almost couldn’t control himself and rushed out, but he gripped his sleeves tightly and the redness in his eyes disappeared.</p><p>“Ha! Inter-spatial wheel? Interesting…”</p><p>Fear filled the long street. Under everyone’s shocked gaze, the bald man who sat on the corpse, crushed the toy in his hand.</p><p>The explosion of the Heaven Secrets spiritual array did not even pierce the skin on his hand. His voice was terrifyingly cold.</p><p>“When the white-clothed people chased after me, they used up all these trash, but they didn’t even touch the edges of my clothes.” “Now, how dare you take it out so openly in my presence?”</p><p>“Are you courting death?”</p><p>With a thump, Xi’s heart shrank.</p><p>This time, it wasn’t like the unknown method that robbed his body’s strength earlier. Instead, his heart palpitated and he had a sudden whim and the urge to die.</p><p>Before Xi could react, he felt that the world had become shorter…</p><p>No! It was the giant beast that had rushed in front of him and lifted him up!</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>Xi’s scalp went numb. What kind of speed was this? Even he did not see what happened?</p><p>“Chief!”</p><p>The three people on his left and right no longer cared about keeping their identities hidden. As they cried out in surprise, they suddenly drew their sabers.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Xi didn’t even see when the bald man attacked.</p><p>However, the corpses on his left and right separated and their heads exploded. Their bodies were sent flying by a huge force and were embedded in the wall of the tea house.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The wall collapsed.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, he handled four Sovereign Stage!</p><p>Even killing a chicken was not as fast as this!</p><p>“Please spare my life! I’m good… I’m a bad person!”</p><p>When the waiter saw this scene, he knelt on the ground and kowtowed repeatedly. His crotch was soaked.</p><p>He was just a part-time worker. Who would have thought that the disaster would happen so quickly and so many people around him would be killed in an instant?</p><p>The most ridiculous thing was that the bald man had just killed someone when he sat on him. By the time he reacted, the people in the teahouse far away had their heads blown off.</p><p>How could one not be terrified by such a killing speed?</p><p>The bald man didn’t even glance at the waiter. He just stared at the young man whose face had turned red. He sneered as he said coldly.</p><p>“I’ve said it before. The dogs from the Holy Divine Palace are not to go near Changle Street!”</p><p>“Could it be that you don’t understand human language, or have you forgotten who I am because I’ve been away for too long?”</p><p>The Holy Divine Palace…</p><p>Dog?</p><p>Xi felt humiliated. He clenched his teeth and was about to explode.</p><p>However, the voice of Hallmaster Dao came from the mini battle communicator in his ear. It was a telepathic communication through his soul.</p><p>“Don’t resist! Don’t speak! Don’t look at each other!”</p><p>The three ‘Don’t’.</p><p>His tone was nervous and anxious and one that brooked no questions.</p><p>‘No, I can take the fight head-on. Even if I can’t kill him, I can at least successfully escape. My life and death are not under his control…’ Just as Xi was about to look up, he suddenly recalled the look in the Hallmaster’s eyes in the Saint Hall.</p><p>That’s right, he was now a member of the Heavenly Group. How could he disobey the orders of Hallmaster Dao?</p><p>He forcefully lowered his ancient swordsman’s head and used all his strength to prevent himself from raising it. However, he gritted his teeth so hard that it drew blood.</p><p>“Go back and tell Dao Qiongcang that if there’s a next time, Ai Cangsheng won’t be able to keep an eye on me.”</p><p>The bald man did not intend to bully the young. He casually threw the young man into the tea house.</p><p>Xi was still young and impetuous. In the end, he couldn’t suppress the anger in his heart and raised his head.</p><p>Even Ai Cangsheng would not be able to keep an eye on him. What did he mean? Before he could get an answer, Xi’s eyes suddenly widened.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A wave of air exploded on the long street. It rippled through the space and spread for ten miles.</p><p>The ferocious man, who was like a prehistoric beast, leaped in the direction of the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe in the distant horizon. His body expanded steadily.</p><p>He roared angrily like a wild beast.</p><p>“Xiu! Shen! was! injured! and! Du! Jing! died! in !shock!”</p><p>He paused at each word of this ancient cultivation skill – the Eight Doors technique and each pause echoed clearly.</p><p>The bald man’s body, that had expanded into a small giant, could no longer cover up the light that bloomed from the acupuncture points in his body. Bit by bit, one after another, it was as if there were many suns hidden in his body, and they all detonated at this moment.</p><p>In the Yougui Pavilion, Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded.</p><p>The Divine, what were you trying to do?</p><p>It was obvious that he used the Eight Doors technique.</p><p>However, the Divine opened the Eight Doors and stared in the direction of the Sacred Mountain Guizhe with a fierce look on his face. It was as if he wanted to smash the Saint mountain into pieces with a single punch from the far away</p><p>Nine Heavens…</p><p>What did this mean?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Aunt Xiang.</p><p>Aunt Xiang shook her head slightly and did not say anything. However, the worry in her eyes deepened.</p><p>Above the space of the long street, after The Divine opened the Eight Doors, it was as if a god had descended from the heavens. With just his aura alone, the long street that was ten miles long was crushed into pieces, and sand and stones flew everywhere.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>Just as Aunt Xiang had predicted, a black light shot out from the horizon and transformed into a black arrow.</p><p>“Evil Sin Bow Arrow!”</p><p>Xi was greatly shocked. The third Emperor Ai Cangsheng had made a move?</p><p>Then this bald man was at least a Saint Stage… No, a peak demi-saint!</p><p>But he did not stop!</p><p>The Divine still continued his actions!</p><p>After a pause, he faced the sky and roared again.</p><p>“Tianshu! Tianxuan! Tianji! Tianjuan! Yuheng! Kaiyang! Fluctuating Ray!</p><p>After he uttered these seven consecutive words, The Divine’s body emitted a Holy Light that was so strong that it completely enveloped him and made it difficult to see his true appearance.</p><p>He was like a human-shaped sun and his body glowed with a dazzling light that mortals could not look at.</p><p>“Yes, just shoot him to death…”</p><p>What Xi saw was that the bald man didn’t put up any defense, and his eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>As expected, the arrow from the Evil Sin Bow only stalled for a moment before it pierced through the bald man who was enveloped in the colorful light.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The colorful light instantly turned black.</p><p>The burly man instantly let out a beast-like roar as if he had lost his mind. He raised his head like a madman.</p><p>“Cultivation deviation!”</p><p>Xi suddenly stood up and clenched his fists.</p><p>Even the Saint Servant Sleeveless had suffered from cultivation deviation after being shot by the arrow and was helpless.</p><p>How could this guy who came out of nowhere be spared?</p><p>Who knew that in the air, the giant black beast released both its fists, and the devilish energy that enveloped its body exploded and revealed its true appearance.</p><p>He didn’t know when, but his eyes were about to pop out and he had turned into a three-headed creature with six arms.</p><p>His bloodshot eyes were clearly filled with hatred. His mind however was still intact and he could still shout.</p><p>“Shura! Dao!”</p><p>After that, his three heads and six arms expanded. He compressed all his energy into his palm and condensed it into an ultimate source seed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>He was too familiar with this item. Wasn’t it the explosive factor?</p><p>However, The Divine did not throw it out. Instead, he crushed the source seed in his hand.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heartbeat seemed to stop when he saw this.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A loud explosion sounded in the void. The explosive energy did not ravage the entire Jade Capital City. Instead, it was drawn by The Divine and absorbed onto his fist!</p><p>Even the Order of the Great Path could not enter his body. When it came close, it would be grounded into powder by the power of death.</p><p>Who in the world could withstand this punch?</p><p>“Heaven…Dao!”</p><p>The Divine was not done yet!</p><p>He closed his eyes, and when he opened them again, there was no desire or light in them.</p><p>The divine beam descended from the sky and enveloped him. His figure disappeared.</p><p>In the next second, a bald giant that was as tall as the sky teleported from the distant Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>The giant swung a fist that was as big as half of the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe. Under the shocked gazes of everyone in the Jade Capital City, he brazenly threw a punch at the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>“God level Shattering Fist!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
