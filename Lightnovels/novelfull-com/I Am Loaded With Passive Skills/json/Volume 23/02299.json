There’s still a chance!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held his head and his hands trembled as he tried to maintain his composure.</p><p>He felt that the energy had not dissipated. The blessings of the Dragon Apricot Tree were still there. The blessings of the Nine Great Ancestral Trees were really awesome!</p><p>He couldn’t delay any longer…</p><p>Which passive skill should he awaken with the third Saint opportunity?</p><p>Countless thoughts flashed through Xu Xiaoshou’s mind as he analyzed the possible directions of the second awakening of various Extended Passive Skills.</p><p>In an instant, he made up his mind.</p><p>“Agility!”</p><p>“Agility is used to maximize one’s speed so one can reach the heavens in one step.”</p><p>“This awakened skill is basically useless after my Space Dao Disc used the Profound Dao Seed. I should still be able to use it under special circumstances…</p><p>no, it can be used in the Spell Forbidden Barrier. It’s fundamentally different from the space attributes, but it’s still powerful.”</p><p>“However, Agility is not only limited to speed, but also the strengthening of reaction and awareness. These are the most important factors that affect the outcome of a battle between high-level experts.”</p><p>“My current battle consciousness is close to the third realm. However, in the final analysis, it’s only close to the third realm. My essence is at the peak of the second realm. Only when I face something like the Divine Oracle and focus, then can I barely touch the third realm…”</p><p>“If I put in more practice and get into more fights, I might be able to break through to the third realm of battle consciousness.”</p><p>“There’s no time! There will be a great battle next!”</p><p>“A battle consciousness close to the third realm might seem enough, but in reality, if you encounter a battle maniac like The Divine who is definitely at the third realm, or even at the peak of the third realm or above, you will definitely lose!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou recalled the scene of Bazhun’an’s night assault back at the Tiansang Spirit Palace. Ye Xiaotian appeared, but he was killed in one move and lost an arm.</p><p>“Your space attributes were not bad, but your battle consciousness is a little weak…” This was Bazhun’an’s original comment.</p><p>Now when he thought about it, it was the first time he had heard of the concept of battle consciousness. Unfortunately, he had been too far away and did not pay any attention to it at that time.</p><p>He had to pay attention to it now!</p><p>When a low-level combatant’s battle consciousness met a high-level combatant, it was just like how Ye Xiaotian had clashed with Bazhun’an and how Kong Yuhen met The Divine.</p><p>Both of them were sent flying before they could even react.</p><p>“Bazhun’an already said that Kong Yuhen’s strength had recovered to a level</p><p>that was even stronger than when he was one of the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>However, he didn’t even have the time to activate his Spatial Upanishad before</p><p>he was sent flying by The Divine’s virtual image with a single punch…”</p><p>“That’s right. Kong Yuhen, one of the Ten High Nobles was defeated by The</p><p>Divine once. After so many years, he still needed time to recover his strength. The Divine doesn’t recall this from before, so why did he not make any progress?”</p><p>“By the same logic, if I were to really start a war with those people from that era, would I be able to estimate their current combat strength based on an outdated evaluation?”</p><p>“Absolutely not! ”</p><p>“Aunt Xiang is right. These people might be restricted, but they are all even more terrifying. I’m already an era behind, so I can’t be any slower.”</p><p>When he thought of this, Xu Xiaoshou no longer hesitated and bound his Agility to the Awakening Stone.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>“Second awakening successful.”</p><p>“Agility Awakened: Ascend to the heavens in one step.” “Agility Second Awakening: Moment of Enlightenment.”</p><p>What?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost couldn’t react in time. He was confused by the many messages that suddenly popped up.</p><p>One-one shot into the soul?</p><p>The Berserk Giant suddenly opened his eyes and looked at the Dragon Apricot in extreme lust and his eyes were filled with madness.</p><p>“I did it!”</p><p>“I did it this time! Two million Passive Points and three second awakenings.</p><p>This was better than expected!”</p><p>“There were two left?”</p><p>As he looked at the two remaining Awakening Stones, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt at a loss.</p><p>This was too smooth!</p><p>Were the ancestral tree’s blessings really that powerful?</p><p>Could it be that he had accidentally turned on some switch and used his lifespan to activate the second awakening?</p><p>“What else can I awaken…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not dream any longer. He decided to fool around and tied the Recoil, and was sure that he would not get anything in return.</p><p>“Second awakening failed.” Failure…</p><p>Good, this was normal!</p><p>But why do I feel a little dizzy? Could it be that my lifespan had been exhausted and I’m about to die?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou subconsciously wanted to bind a Recoil to fool around with and prayed it would not be set off. This time, he really didn’t intend to reverse the damage.</p><p>However, he paused for a moment and then bound the Strengthen to it. He intended to throw it into the Awakening Pool.</p><p>“Binding failed. ”</p><p>This Extended Passive Skill has been awakened to the highest realm.</p><p>As expected, there would not be a third awakening.</p><p>However, it made sense when he thought about it. The Ultimate Giant, Independence and Moment of Enlightenment would only take on names from the Passive System such as Strengthen and Sharpness from the start.</p><p>After it had such an outstanding second awakening name, it didn’t seem like he could have an awakening again.</p><p>If he really had three awakenings, he would probably be a ‘super God’!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou exhaled lightly, but he did not have such desires.</p><p>He bound the Recoil again and threw the Awakening Stone into the pool.</p><p>“Second awakening failed.”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>It felt good. His luck must have been exhausted. Hopefully, his lifespan would not be exhausted….</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
