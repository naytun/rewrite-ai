Outsiders only know that he has a good relationship with Bazhun’an, but they don’t know how good it is.” “How good?”</p><p>“Bazhun’an addresses my husband as big brother.” Aunt Xiang’s face glowed with pride when she said this.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was still skeptical about this and changed the topic. “That Hallmaster Dao…”</p><p>“He should be able to guess a thing or two, but he doesn’t have any conclusive evidence. Otherwise, it would be impossible for the Yougui Pavilion to survive until now.” Aunt Xiang sighed, and a trace of annoyance appeared in her eyes. “That Elder Dao the Flamboyant, just the thought of him makes me sick!” At this point, Xu Xiaoshou was completely certain.</p><p>The Ten High Nobles weren’t trash. The so-called ‘Big Boss’s pendant’ was definitely a lie. It was even possible that it had been personally passed down by the person in front of him!</p><p>Aunt Xiang might not be smart at most, but she was definitely a person of some status.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had only experienced that kind of thought frequency and the feeling of being able to communicate like a fish in water from people with the same brain power, such as the Divine Oracle.</p><p>Mu Zixi, Elder Han, Precious Bao, and the Ghost God gang couldn’t be compared at all. They didn’t even need to speak. They gave people a feeling of ‘come and play with me’ sense of stupidity, merely by their presence.</p><p>“You came from afar. Young Master Xu, will you sit now?”</p><p>Aunt Xiang took the God token from Xu Xiaoshou and cast her worries aside. She pointed at the wine in front of him and indicated for him to taste it. Only then did Xu Xiaoshou sit down. He picked up the wine glass and took a sip.</p><p>“How’s the taste?” Aunt Xiang sat down and leaned forward, her eyes filled with anticipation.</p><p>“It’s not poisonous.”</p><p>“Bah!” Aunt Xiang rolled her eyes and said flirtatiously, “I’m asking about the taste of the alcohol… I’ve spent a lot of money to treat you to this Drunken Immortal Brew. If it were not for Bazhun’an, you wouldn’t even be allowed to enter my room! ”</p><p>“Don’t worry, no matter how good the wine is, I won’t forget what happened downstairs.”</p><p>“You!” Aunt Xiang’s peach blossom eyes glared as if he had seen through her thoughts. Her expression was slightly angry.</p><p>After a short pause, Xu Xiaoshou downed the wine in his glass in one gulp. He clicked his tongue and put down the wine glass. His eyebrows furrowed as he reflected on the taste.</p><p>“The Immortal osmanthus spiritual aura is above first grade and below the Saint grade. This wine is made with a demi-saint’s medicine? You’ve really invested a lot…”</p><p>“Golden sky root, mulberry purple leaf, red macaque fruit… The use of the liquid is also quite elaborate. Is this brew unique to the Central Region?”</p><p>“It’s a pity that even though there is no conflict with the medicinal properties, there was a slight error in the ratio when the wine was mixed. However, the flaws do not obscure the merits. This wine is good wine…” The sickly young master looked up. “The person is a beauty.”</p><p>“Ah… young man, you’re too good at giving compliments!”</p><p>Aunt Xiang didn’t expect Xu Xiaoshou to be able to understand these words. Her eyes lit up, she straightened her back and exuded the charm of a mature woman.</p><p>After a long time, her radiance subsided and she rested her chin on her delicate hand. She stared at the sickly young master opposite her and clicked her tongue in wonder.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, oh Xu Xiaoshou, you’re so good.”</p><p>“If Aunt Xiang was born thirty years later, if it were another young lady here, she would really be mesmerized by you…”</p><p>She suddenly stretched out her hand as if she wanted to pinch that delicate face. “Let me see. Did Bazhun’an choose your face, or is it your own?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou leaned back and waved his paper fan to stop Aunt Xiang from moving. “Aunt Xiang, please behave yourself.”</p><p>“You little brat!” Aunt Xiang smiled unhappily. “You could be my son. Why are you playing hard to get with me?”</p><p>“Playing hard to get… Ah, you have a son?”</p><p>“No! But that’s not all. If I didn’t know that you were faking it, I would really have been deceived… How do you know so much?”</p><p>“I am a Sovereign Stage Elixir Master, the real deal.”</p><p>“Wow, that’s really outstanding. Let me see your true appearance. Quick! ”</p><p>Aunt Xiang said as she pounced on him again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was horrified. This woman was a little too enthusiastic. Did she really treat him as her son?</p><p>However, she had taken out the Saint Servant token… Unable to dissuade her, Xu Xiaoshou could only temporarily remove the sickly young master’s face and revert to his original appearance.</p><p>Aunty Xiang was instantly stunned. Her eyes lit up. “Little brat, you’re indeed beautiful…</p><p>“+(Praise received. Passive Points),+l.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t bear such intense passion. Was this a new way to fight?</p><p>His rationality told him that there was something wrong with Aunt Xiang.</p><p>Soon, she revealed her foxlike character. She cupped her fists in front of her chest, her face full of sorrow and tenderness.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, Bazhun’an insisted that we put your strength and intelligence to the test, that is why the incident downstairs took place.”</p><p>“But you’re so good-looking. You definitely won’t blame Aunt Xiang for what happened with the Ghost God gang, right? Surely not?”</p><p>“+(Request received. Passive Points),+l.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s scalp went numb.</p><p>This woman really knew how to make full use of her strength.</p><p>Who could withstand such an attack?</p><p>A hero could not be defeated by a beauty. Had The Divine fallen for this move?</p><p>“That’s another matter!”</p><p>“Then don’t even think about leaving tonight.” Aunty Xiang wiped away her tears. “Stay here with me until tomorrow morning. I’ll see if The Divine… No!</p><p>Would Bazhun’an let you off?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded. He stood up immediately. “Would you believe that that I’ll leave now?”</p><p>“Would you believe that I’ll scream right now?” Aunt Xiang looked aggrieved and bullied.</p><p>Xu Xiao was impressed.</p><p>You can play this kind of game?</p><p>This door was indeed not that easy to enter…</p><p>“Let’s talk business first!”</p><p>“If you don’t want to talk about it, then don’t talk about it. If you don’t want to listen, I won’t listen…” Aunt Xiang shook her head till it almost rattled. Suddenly, her eyes lit up and she grabbed Xu Xiaoshou’s hand. “How about this? Let’s put this matter aside. I’ll give you something that you need the most right now. You’ll definitely like it.”</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“You have to agree first!”</p><p>“Impossible, I, Xu Xiaoshou will not accept threats…”</p><p>“Just agree! This will only benefit you. There will be no harm! I swear!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never encountered such an offensive before, and his hard bones almost softened.</p><p>And Aunt Xiang was a Saint Servant, so it would not be good to fall out with her directly.</p><p>He suddenly discovered a fatal flaw in himself. He could be coaxed but not forced!</p><p>“I agree…” Xu Xiaoshou quickly pulled his hand away and took a deep breath. He decided he would not suffer any losses. “So, what do I need the most now?”</p><p>Aunt Xiang winked at him with an expression that said, ‘It’s your lucky day!’ Her red lips parted slightly and she enunciated each word.</p><p>“Miss Ah Yao!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
