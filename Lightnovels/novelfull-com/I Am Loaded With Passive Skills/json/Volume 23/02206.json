(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>He looked at Yu Lingdi, who had collapsed amid the wind, and then at Yu MO, who looked nonchalant and totally at ease. He looked back at the son, who was covered in blood and tears, and then at the father, who was calm and collected.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grabbed Lei Xi’er’s hand and applauded heartily. He clicked his tongue in wonder.</p><p>“Wonderful!”</p><p>“It’s too entertaining!”</p><p>“I’m willing to call it a world-famous painting.”</p><p>The descendant of a genius, the power Upanishad of father and son, the void passage, ruthless deception, dazed stupor, the only survivor…</p><p>As an outsider, Xu Xiaoshou could tell that Water Ghost had put in a lot of effort to set up this trap.</p><p>Didn’t you see that after the first round on Abyss Island, the Holy Divine Palace collapsed?</p><p>Number Two died, Yan Wuse died, Rao Yaoyao died, Dao Qiongcang self-destructed, and Wangze Holy Emperor’s consciousness was captured.</p><p>There were also too many nameless red-clothed people, white-clothed people and the Chief of the six divisions. More than half of them were gone.</p><p>Only Yu Lingdi was intact!</p><p>From the results, everyone could see that this was Water Ghost’s excessive fatherly love!</p><p>However, this love was a little too heavy-handed.</p><p>From the perspective of a son, Yu Lingdi did not do anything. He was originally at the arena of the Holy Divine Palace. He was ruthlessly used by his father until the end of the battle before he returned. After he came out, everyone was dead.</p><p>How could he turn back?</p><p>How should he face it?</p><p>No one could accept such a situation. They did not even dare to think about it. They could only treat it as a nightmare and try their best to forget it. But no matter what, it was impossible to do so, right?</p><p>Yu Lingdi clearly wanted to say something. His lips twitched and trembled for a long time but he could not say anything.</p><p>The wind that blew through the post-war ruins was so cold that it poured into his eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. It was so cold that it penetrated through his organs and even the soles of his feet.</p><p>Water Ghost held the secondary plane door in his left hand and swiped out with his right hand. The Sea God’s Trident appeared and he stepped forward.</p><p>“You don’t have to forgive me, my child.”</p><p>“As you can see, I made use of you, and everyone in the Holy Divine Palace is dead. ”</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao, Yan Wuse, Number Two, Ye Xiao, Teng Shanhai…”</p><p>Water Ghost reeled off the facts. The Sea God’s Trident in his hand trembled crazily as if it tried to resist something.</p><p>“Oh, right, there’s also this one.”</p><p>He seemed to recall something, and the secondary plane door in his left hand lit up.</p><p>Situ Yongren, who hid in the void but could not be taken away by Dao</p><p>Qiongcang’s self-destruction, emerged with a look of horror in his eyes.</p><p>The mournful wail only lasted for half a second.</p><p>With a bang, Situ Yongren exploded in a shower of blood and died without a burial place.</p><p>The demi-saint Upanishad crushed Situ Yongren like an ant.</p><p>Water Ghost’s gaze didn’t even waver for a moment. He just carried the Sea God’s Trident that no longer trembled and had quieted down, and came before Yu Lingdi.</p><p>His gaze was so cold, as if he was a tiger that was about to devour its cub in the next second.</p><p>“Why, why…”</p><p>“Why did you do this?!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s body trembled. He could finally make a sound, but he could not accept what had happened.</p><p>He couldn’t accept that his father, who had instilled in him since childhood, the idea of loyalty to the Saint Mountain, the Holy Divine Palace, the Path, and himself, had chosen to betray him when he returned.</p><p>He even destroyed Situ Yongren in front of him.</p><p>Since he could be so heartless, didn’t this prove that what he said was true? That the entire array at the Holy Divine Palace had died!</p><p>Actually, there was no need for any proof.</p><p>The ruined battlefield, the crisscrossing traces of demi-saints’ battles, and the Saint Servants who stood on the ground; all these announced the end of the battle for the Holy Divine Palace in the Abyss Island.</p><p>Then…</p><p>What about himself?</p><p>As the Spirit Division Chief, would he also end up in this manner and die at the hands of this heartless father?</p><p>Yu Lingdi wanted to resist.</p><p>However, before he could even make any move, he felt that he had completely lost control.</p><p>Even a drop of blood or a wisp of Qi in his body did not belong to him at this moment.</p><p>Water Ghost had never used the secondary plane door to seal his ability.</p><p>However, a Water-type Upanishad demi-saint could control a water-type</p><p>Spiritual Cultivator; with just a thought, he could render Yu Lingi motionless.</p><p>He was like a tiger cub whose fangs had been removed. Even his roar sounded weak, and he could not release even a trace of his might in front of the real overlord of the forest.</p><p>“Kill me, kill me…’</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s voice trembled when he saw Water Ghost raise the Sea God’s Trident high in the air.</p><p>Once upon a time, this was also a divine object that he had dreamed of. It was a water-type supreme treasure, and it was unique.</p><p>His thoughts were all over the place…</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>Water Ghost seemed to grant his wish and stabbed the trident into Yu Lingdi’s chest. Blood splattered everywhere in the sky.</p><p>This trident strike made everyone’s hair stand on end. Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>He really made a move?</p><p>No matter what Water Ghost did, Xu Xiaoshou had seen the painstaking efforts behind his actions. However, at this moment, he really couldn’t figure out this vile person who held such a grudge. Even a vicious tiger would not eat its cubs!</p><p>“Oh…”</p><p>Yu Lingdi didn’t expect his death to happen so suddenly. Yu MO actually…</p><p>NO!</p><p>Soon, Yu Lingdi felt that something was wrong.</p><p>Although he suffered pain when the trident pierced his chest, the speed at which the Sea God’s Trident absorbed his blood was unusually fast.</p><p>Furthermore, when the blood flowed out, it didn’t disappear, but rather, it fused with him.</p><p>In less than three breaths, Yu Lingdi felt no more pain. He felt that there was a slightly dissatisfied and disdainful spirit that had connected to his spiritual senses.</p><p>Spirit?</p><p>Where did the spirit come from?</p><p>Water Ghost finally released the Sea God’s Trident and allowed this weapon that was ranked among the ten Great Psionic Weapons to pierce into his son’s chest and stay inside his body.</p><p>He leaned forward, smiled and whispered something in his ear that only the father and son could hear;</p><p>“The road is at your feet. There’s no need to look back.. Go and wander!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
