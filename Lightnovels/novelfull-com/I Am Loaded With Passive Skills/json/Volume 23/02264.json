Why would the Hallmaster run away first?</p><p>It was not scary that deaths had occurred at Sky City. It didn’t matter if it was Dao Qiongcang’s fault or not. The people at the bottom wouldn’t and didn’t want to care about it.</p><p>What they were worried about was that they would have to face a powerful enemy like the Saint Servant. What should they do if they were leaderless?</p><p>Would the new Hallmaster be able to surpass the previous one?</p><p>Everyone had witnessed Dao Qiongcang’s past achievements. If he couldn’t take down Sky City, what could the new Hallmaster do?</p><p>“Zhong Yuanzi…”</p><p>Everyone’s eyes swiveled to the old Elder with the afro hairdo and who was dressed in tattered clothes.</p><p>One of the four divine envoys, the Elemental Divine Envoy, Zhong Yuanzi, was the designated successor appointed by Hallmaster Dao!</p><p>“Is he qualified?”</p><p>Prior to this, the crowd didn’t have much of an impression of the Elemental Divine Envoy. He was only a demi-saint and an element expert. He was a theoretical person who liked to study the path of Spiritual Cultivation.</p><p>Now, it seemed that he was actually a wise man. Could he take over the lifeline of the continent and control the future of the Holy Divine Palace?</p><p>However, when everyone looked over, they saw the astonishment in the old man’s eyes. It even surpassed theirs.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi initially mumbled to himself in a low voice and had not paid any attention to Dao Qiongcang’s apology. After he heard his name, it took him quite sometime before he registered what had been said and he exclaimed.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, are you crazy?”</p><p>“This was just the start and you’re leaving already? What would we do if you leave?”</p><p>Other than Ai Cangsheng, all the Saints beside him were shocked and looked over.</p><p>“Yes, Little Dao… Ptui, I mean Hallmaster Dao, who will fight the Saint Servant if you retreat? You’re the one who’s most familiar with Bazhun’an. I don’t want to think about it…Uh, I don’t have a good plan and have no idea how to kill the Eighth Sword Deity!”</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, to retreat is easy, but to move forward with a heavy burden is difficult. The spirits of the dead in Heaven do not blame you for their deaths nor do they want you to feel so guilty that you chose to retreat.”</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, you should think twice. What you’re doing now is cowardly and not being responsible at all!”</p><p>“Yeah, Hallmaster Dao, you can’t leave…” There was also an array of persuasion from below.</p><p>Compared with the elegant gentleman Dao Qiongcang, no one had any faith in the sloppy Elder with an afro hairdo.</p><p>Zhong Yuanzi was indeed a demi-saint.</p><p>However, from his image, he did not look like Hallmaster material!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang glanced around and everyone fell silent. He smiled bitterly and said.</p><p>“I’ve already made up my mind. This is something that cannot be changed.</p><p>There’s no need to try and persuade me.”</p><p>“Have you made up your mind?”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng sat in his wheelchair and did not even turn his head. He sneered coldly and said, “Do you think you have the final say in the Holy Divine Palace? Do you think you can just fight and retreat as you wish? Who do you think you</p><p>All the Saints were shocked. They looked sideways in surprise and were deep in thought.</p><p>Everyone below froze and felt their scalps go numb and their feet turn cold.</p><p>What did this mean?</p><p>They had not discussed it properly and now their internal strife was out in public?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang closed his eyes and sighed. He shook his head slightly and looked over. “Ai Cangsheng…”</p><p>“I observed the lives of the world and see the warmth and coldness in human feelings, yet I still sit here.”</p><p>“Abyss Island only suffered a small defeat. Are you are under so much pressure that you need to quit?”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng stared into space and did not even turn his head. He completely ignored what Dao Qiongcang said.</p><p>“If you have anything to say, just say it. There are so many people watching, there’s no need to beat around the bush.”</p><p>Elder Yu and the Ninth Divine Priest’s expressions changed.</p><p>Even Wei Feng and Zhong Yuanzi noticed it and their expressions were a little strange.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang sighed again, he wanted to say something but stopped.</p><p>“Right! If you can’t say it, I’ll say it for you.”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng placed his hands on the Evil Sin Bow, looked at the void, and said coldly.</p><p>“The Chiefs of the six divisions had neglected their duties and were not serious in carrying out their missions. They also looked down on the enemy. They should be severely punished and deserve to die.”</p><p>“It was not a big deal in the past. It’s just that the mission was not that important. It’s normal for them to die when they faced a powerful enemy.”</p><p>“This is not your fault, Dao Qiongcang!”</p><p>Wang Dachui trembled and lowered his head even more when he stood in the presence of everyone in the Physique Division..</p><p>Ai Cangsheng looked steadily ahead. He didn’t look around nor did he call out the names of the living. He was focused on the exposure of the past deeds and said.</p><p>“As the Ruler of the red-clothed people, Rao Yaoyao should have been in charge of the overall situation. However, she was too ambitious and did not change despite having suffered repeated setbacks. She was greedy and rash, neglected her subordinates and caused the deaths of thousands of the red and white-clothed people on Yunlun Mountain and Abyss Island.”</p><p>“Her crime was so great that she should have been sentenced to death in the Dead Sea as punishment. Since she died on Yunlun Mountain, then I won’t hold her accountable.”</p><p>“This is not your fault!”</p><p>On the jade steps, the Saints were surprised by Ai Cangsheng’s bluntness. Even the people below felt slightly disturbed.</p><p>After all, after they more or less listened to the lecture here, everyone naturally knew a little about ‘mercy’…</p><p>Emperor Cangsheng was an outsider; whatever Dao Qiongcang dared not comment on, he dared to say it out loud?</p><p>However, it was obvious that Ai Cangsheng had hidden more than that. At this moment, he revealed everything.</p><p>“Elder Yan was righteous and loyal. However, he had enjoyed peace at the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe for such a long time and had forgotten about the intricacies of life and death.’</p><p>“On Abyss Island, he fell into the enemy’s trap. He lost his way and encountered a dangerous situation. Only then did he realize it and had regrets. He finally died and his message to us was that his life was one of sorrow but he died in peace!”</p><p>“This is not your fault!”</p><p>After Ai Cangsheng finished his lecture, the entire Saint Hall fell silent due to fear.</p><p>Everyone could listen between the lines. Naturally, they trembled in fear; it was as if they walked on thin ice and were afraid that they had done something out of line..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
