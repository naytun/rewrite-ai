Exotic Hall?</p><p>The people from the Central Region were indeed fundamentally different from those guys from the Eastern Region, who were obsessed with swords…</p><p>They really knew how to enjoy themselves!</p><p>Old Man Li, who was slightly hunched, got off the carriage first. He found a small wooden stool and used it as a temporary short wooden step for the owner of the carriage to alight.</p><p>He recalled that this man was very capable, but his body was very delicate. He could not stand the wind and rain, let alone a fall.</p><p>Old Man Li’s careful actions naturally attracted the attention of the surrounding passers-by.</p><p>Which weak woman was so delicate?</p><p>Originally, fragrant osmanthus carriages were already extremely regal. There were even fewer people who were the descendants of higher voids.</p><p>When the carriage stopped at the entrance of Yougui Pavilion, the two girls’ shimmery eyes lit up almost instantly.</p><p>When they saw Old Man Li’s actions, they wanted to say something but hesitated.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>With a click, the sickly young master bent down and came out of the carriage. The moment he stepped down from the wooden step and raised his head, the surroundings fell silent.</p><p>Even the passers-by stopped in their tracks and turned to look and their eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>“F*ck! Who is this? Isn’t he too handsome?” “Zhou! Old Zhou! Look, isn’t this your favorite?”</p><p>“Awesome, even I want to book him…</p><p>“Shut up! Do you see that carriage? It’s the descendant of a higher void. Be careful not to cause trouble!”</p><p>Even the young lady from the Yougui Pavilion, who wanted to call for help but stopped herself, reached out and tugged at the arm beside her. She was very bold and wild. Her eyes were green as she blurted out.</p><p>“So delicate, so tender, so sick…”</p><p>“Cui’er, I really like this one!” “+(Watched, Passive Points +)+23.”</p><p>“+(lnfatuated, Passive Points+) +98.”</p><p>“+(Watched, Passive Points +)+125.”</p><p>The Information Bar popped up wildly. Xu Xiaoshou could feel the wolf-like gazes around him, and he started to panic.</p><p>“Baz! Hun! An!”</p><p>As he gritted his teeth and roared in his heart, Xu Xiaoshou finally understood why Bazhun’an had deliberately damaged his foundational roots as well as the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy. As a result, the ‘patient’, who was temporarily unable to take any action matched this sickly young master’s disposition after he came out of seclusion.</p><p>Originally, he had wanted to make a flashy entrance and and snatch a wave of Passive Points.</p><p>He didn’t expect to come to such a place! Bazhun’an had even prepared this move! “This scammer…”</p><p>“That’s not right. How did he know so much…”</p><p>His feelings were such : 30% suspicion, 30% fear, and 40% pretense at being calm. He followed the principle of ‘since you’re here, just follow the flow”.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou ignored the gazes of the people around him and turned to look at Old Man Li. He casually threw out a bag of Spirit Crystals and said smoothly.</p><p>“Alright, you can leave now.”</p><p>Old Man Li weighed the money bag in his hand and put it away in his sleeve. He was not in a hurry to leave.</p><p>“Young Master, what you just said…” He adjusted his belt and smiled again. “You’re already here…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment. Then, he laughed and waved his sleeves. “Then, follow me. I’ll treat you to all the tea and wine today.”</p><p>“Eh, thank you, Young Master!”</p><p>When the two ‘apricots’ heard this, their eyes lit up even more, and they quickly rushed over.</p><p>That Qiao’er was actually faster than the other girl. She grabbed the sickly young master’s hand and embraced him. “Young Master, please come in.”</p><p>“Careful…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou subconsciously wanted to shout out a warning, but he realized that things were no longer the same as before. There was no need for that.</p><p>The Heavenly Ancestor Legacy had completely transformed him.</p><p>He was now considered half an Abyss Clan person, and he had superb control over his physical strength.</p><p>Although he could not turn off the Extended Passive Skills like Sharpness and Recoil, he could contain them under his skin with a thought. At least he did not have to worry about hurting any outsiders.</p><p>Moreover, his foundational roots were damaged, and the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy had not been fully absorbed. He could not use his power without authorization. After Xu Xiaoshou came out of seclusion, he simply asked Bazhun’an for the Hidden Sword Technique.</p><p>The Holy Emperor Lv.o Sword Technique Expertise, as well as the Unity of Man and the Heavens – Xu Xiaoshou was enlightened after Bazhun’an finished talking.</p><p>In the end, he was unable to exert any strength, so he borrowed Eighth Brother’s move to inscribe the word ‘sword’ and hid it in the energy reserve of his energy center.</p><p>As long as the word was not shattered, even if Dao Qiongcang passed by, he would not be able to recognize Xu Xiaoshou’s identity through the Divine Path Principles or any familiar aura.</p><p>He didn’t know if it was true or not, but since Bazhun’an said so, Xu Xiaoshou dared to believe in it.</p><p>Now, he was truly a sick young master.</p><p>When Qiao’er pulled his hand, Xu Xiaoshou almost fell apart. The hidden word nearly scattered and revealed his bestial nature.</p><p>“Take it easy, take it easy…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wanted to wave his hand, but Qiao’er seemed determined to try and stuff his arm into her chest.</p><p>He didn’t know if he should enjoy it or be shocked.</p><p>He deliberately exerted some his strength from under the surface of his body before he pulled his hand out of the embrace of this Innate Stage Qiao’er, so that the beauty would not die from the shock.</p><p>Qiao’er who had light makeup on but was still pretty, was a little depressed. She secretly pursed her lips. Were her assets not enough? Or was because he could not do it…</p><p>However, she didn’t show any emotion. She maintained a smile. “How should I address you, Young Master?”</p><p>The sister beside her smiled and gently held the sickly young master’s hand. She stood on tiptoe and exhaled. She said gently, “Young Master, you can call me Yingying…”</p><p>“+(Seduced, Passive Points+)+l.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shivered..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
