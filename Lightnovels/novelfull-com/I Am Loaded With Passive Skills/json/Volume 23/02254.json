The students could then use the power of the Qilin to train for the Holy Palace Trial.</p><p>“This was the main reason why the Holy Palace Trial would be held in the Four Symbols Secret Realm whenever possible!”</p><p>Aunt Xiang was like a know-it-all who had information about everything. She knew the secrets of the Holy Palace and the secret history of the continent like the back of her hand.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was truly impressed.</p><p>Aunt Xiang was very skillful at gathering information. Even without The Divine, she was definitely not just a decorative piece.</p><p>And unlike Bazhun’an who kept his knowledge hidden, Aunt Xiang was not ambiguous and revealed everything she knew. This was Xu Xiaoshou’s favorite point!</p><p>All of a sudden, he felt that his train of thought flowed smoothly, and all the illogical points in the past also merged together.</p><p>“Abyss Island-Four Symbols Secret Realm…”</p><p>He thought that it was his good luck to enter Abyss Island.</p><p>After that, he came to the Four Symbols Secret Realm and entered the Holy Palace step by step, he then thrived under the care of the Demi-Saint Infernal.</p><p>It turned out that he had taken it for granted!</p><p>The path that Bazhun’an had pointed out to him after the battle in the Eighth Palace was not the proper path of cultivation under the Eight Classics, but the path to death!</p><p>Had he planned all of this back then?</p><p>If a normal person were to walk this path, he would have died.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was also an extraordinary person. He could still hold on until now but he could barely catch up with the cultivation progress of the previous era.</p><p>D*mn Eighth Brother… Xu Xiaoshou silently cursed a certain disabled person in his heart. After he calmed down, he asked, “That Qilin is a Holy Emperor level ghost beast?”</p><p>“It can be understood in that way.” After Aunt Xiang was done with the explanations, she felt very thirsty and poured herself some wine.</p><p>“Actually, that’s not a ghost beast. It’s a spiritual beast that had lived since ancient times. I don’t know how long ago that was.”</p><p>“But now, its state and its existence are not much different from the ghost beast.”</p><p>“As for the Holy Emperor…”</p><p>Aunty Xiang took a sip and moistened her red lips before she said.</p><p>“There was no doubt about it!”</p><p>“That’s why we need to cooperate with it and borrow its power.”</p><p>“The Saint Servant alone can’t overthrow the rule of the Holy Divine Palace and the five great Holy Emperors’ aristocratic family.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was silent.</p><p>Then there was indeed a reason to enter the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>It had indeed been just a wishful thought not to receive the attack and avoid Dao Qiongcang’s trap.</p><p>In fact, Xu Xiaoshou already knew what was on Bazhun’an’s mind from the fact that during the battle Abyss Island had with the Holy Divine Palace and the Holy Emperor, most of the Saint Servant Nine Thrones did not appear. The main force was the Inner Island’s ghost beasts.</p><p>Bazhun’an was a genius.</p><p>However, in the same era, even in the previous era, it was difficult to find someone who had half his ability.</p><p>Therefore, he did not have that much time to wait for the people around him to mature.</p><p>He could only make use of the people, spirits, and beasts who were currently suffering, who similarly needed freedom, and who were so powerful that they had to be Holy Emperors from the start. Life and death items!</p><p>As long as they could cooperate, he was willing to try.</p><p>He was so confident that he would not be used by others. He could even gather all the Holy Emperors around him and form a team.</p><p>They could use this opportunity to fight against the five Holy Emperors’ aristocratic family!</p><p>If this was before, even if the Five Holy Emperors’ aristocratic family knew that these forces were scattered outside, they would not have paid much attention to them.</p><p>Apart from anything else…</p><p>The Inner Island of the Abyss Island could be split into the Black and White veins. The Third Ancestor of the White Vein had his own plans, and the lower demi-saints had their own ulterior motives too.</p><p>Even if they worked together to release the Holy Emperor Fengtian, even he knew that there would be no good consequences if he resisted the Holy Divine Palace, let alone the Five Holy Emperors’ aristocratic family. Therefore, he had struck out on his own.</p><p>They were all Holy Emperors, so who would submit to whom?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could readily sense the contempt of the five Holy Emperor aristocratic family towards these powers. It was as scattered as the stars in the sky or sand.</p><p>If it were him, he wouldn’t have paid much attention to it.</p><p>Even a ghost would not have realized this. Bazhun’an had ‘fallen’ and had ‘been silent’ for decades, and now he had just started to exert his strength.</p><p>There had not been a genius like him for a hundred generations. It would be hard to find another expert in ten thousand years… When he thought about how Bazhun’an even dared to threaten the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit, Xu Xiaoshou smiled and looked forward to it.</p><p>“How was the progress of your cooperation with that Qilin?”</p><p>“No progress.” Aunt Xiang’s brows furrowed and she looked very worried. “After the Frost Ferret sensed the Qilin, it only established a connection with it, but no one cared too much about it.”</p><p>“In other words, there was zero progress?” Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>“At least we’re still in contact. The Frost Ferret had also been released from the Inner Island.” Aunt Xiang hesitated. “This can be counted as a first, right?”</p><p>What was the difference between this and zero?</p><p>“What should we do next?” Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>“The trial of the Four Symbols Secret Realm had officially begun. That meant that Elder Dao the Flamboyant’s plan would definitely come to an end. It will be too late to go any further, so we have to enter early.” Aunt Xiang counted with her fingers.</p><p>“Uh-huh.”</p><p>“But based on my understanding of Elder Dao the Flamboyant, if he was the one in charge, he would have already prepared all kinds of tricks, let alone capture us.”</p><p>“Uh-huh.”</p><p>“But we still have to go. We have to be well-prepared. It’s best if we can get more information about the Four Symbols Secret Realm. Moreover, we have fewer people but more elites. If we have too many people, we will be too big a target…”</p><p>“Then, the Qilin ignored you and failed to communicate with you. When it turned to leave, our beloved Hallmaster Dao walked out from behind you with a smile.” Xu Xiaoshou continued.</p><p>“Uh…” Aunt Xiang smiled awkwardly. “That would indeed be the worst outcome.”</p><p>“The moment you turned around, the Qilin became Hallmaster Dao.”</p><p>“When you sleep at night and lift up your blanket, all you see is our dear Hallmaster Dao!”</p><p>“Uh, Xu Xiaoshou, just say whatever you want to say. There’s no need to beat around the bush.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was furious. “How can this succeed. There’s no hope at all and they’re just waiting for you to go over!”</p><p>“So it’s indeed very difficult! But there is still an opportunity…The Holy Divine Palace doesn’t know that our target is the Qilin. They think it’s the Ran Ming ruins!”</p><p>“To heck with opportunity, isn’t that about right? What difference does it make if you turn left or look right after you enter someone else’s territory?”</p><p>“Uh, it seems that the logic is so…” “Then are we still going?”</p><p>“Bazhun’an said we will succeed.”</p><p>Bazhun’an said that?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickly suppressed his anger. He held the paper fan to his chin and thought about what he might have missed.</p><p>No matter how he thought about it, he still felt that he was doomed.</p><p>Could it be that Bazhun’an still had some hidden trump cards?</p><p>I’m already the second-in-command saint servant. Such a dangerous operation should be ‘discussed’ first, right?</p><p>“What else did Bazhun’an say?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“He said…” Aunty Xiang paused for a moment, then mimicked Bazhun’an tone perfectly.</p><p>“I believe in Lord Shou!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
