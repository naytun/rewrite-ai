We can use the time, place, and people to achieve victory.”</p><p>“Then, once you leave Abyss Island, you’ll have to bear the brunt of the attacks no matter where you are on the Shengshen Continent.”</p><p>“And this time, the person who set up the chess pieces and the array, and waited for the battle would not be anyone else. It could only be Elder Dao the Flamboyant… ”</p><p>Aunt Xiang seemed to hate Dao Qiongcang, but that did not stop her from acknowledging his ability. The mere mention of this name gave her a headache.</p><p>“What if we don’t take the hit?” Xu Xiaoshou muttered as he held his folding fan.</p><p>Even though he had beaten up Elder Dao the Flamboyant, he had also learned from Bazhun’an that Dao Qiongcang had only gone through the motions in the match at Abyss Island. He had not really used his full strength.</p><p>As a victor in the past, it was difficult for him to pay attention to the opponents he had defeated.</p><p>However, this time, for some reason, Xu Xiaoshou felt that Dao Qiongcang was still difficult to deal with. He had clearly fought this person before, but he did not seem to be invincible…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could only take this strange feeling as a sudden whim and he took it seriously.</p><p>However, he had no idea how to deal with the following developments. He could only say that he would deal with them once they surfaced.</p><p>“It’s impossible not to take it.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang knew what Xu Xiaoshou meant, but she shook her head. “We want to enter the Four Symbols Secret Realm not only because of the Ran Ming ruins, but also because there is a special ghost beast that was suppressed there.”</p><p>“Ghost beast?”</p><p>“Yes, the Four Symbols Secret Realm once suppressed the Frost Ferret. You’ve heard of it, right? In the end, it almost caused a problem, so it was transferred to the Inner Island of the Abyss Island.”</p><p>“I know that.” Xu Xiaoshou had heard about this from Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>Elder Han’s combat strength was not strong, but his ability to escape was top-notch.</p><p>First, he was sealed in the Seven Breaks within the Infernal Hell Sea. After the chaos, he was transferred to the Four Symbols Secret Realm and was finally exiled to the Inner Island of the Abyss Island.</p><p>From what Aunt Xiang said, there was a story behind it?</p><p>“When the Frost Ferret was at the Infernal Hell Sea, it communicated with the Great Infernal Ancestor on the Inner Island of the Abyss Island through a crack in the seal. The Seven Breaks appeared because of the Great Infernal Ancestor, so even though the Great Infernal Ancestor was exiled, there was still a connection.”</p><p>“The Frost Ferret made use of this weak connection. Hence, the two of them worked together and schemed against the Holy Divine Palace. This indirectly enabled the Holy Emperor Feng Tian to break out of the seal.’ Xu Xiaoshou was surprised. Elder Han had such ability?</p><p>No, no, no!</p><p>It was definitely the Great Infernal Ancestor who caused this problem. Xiao Han only helped from the outside. It was like a sword that the big Boss used to pry open the seal crack and released Feng Yujin.</p><p>Aunt Xiang continued.</p><p>“The Frost Ferret was still too weak, and it was not too big of a threat. It wasn’t qualified to enter the Inner Island of the Abyss Island, so it was suppressed into the Four Symbols Secret Realm.”</p><p>“But the Frost Ferret was too strong. Because it was young and craved freedom, it caused a lot of problems.”</p><p>“This time, it found a big secret after it passed through the crack in the seal again. The two secrets were revealed at the same time!”</p><p>Aunt Xiang clicked her tongue and exclaimed.</p><p>“One was the Ran Ming ruins.”</p><p>“It found a God-Slaying token somewhere. Perhaps it had a special ability.”</p><p>“In short, its soul was hidden in the token. When the people of the Holy Divine Palace arrived with the other two tokens and wanted to open this unknown ruin, it started to cause problems.”</p><p>“This fellow is vengeful and did not seek any opportunities. The Holy Divine Palace imprisoned it, but it didn’t let those people off easily. Not only did it destroy the ruins, but it also spread the news after he realized that it was the inheritance of the God slayer.”</p><p>“The continent was about to fall into chaos. Even the Demi-Saint families were tempted. The Holy Divine Palace had spent a lot of effort to suppress this matter, but they did not dare to open up the Ran Ming ruins.”</p><p>“It’s a pity that the chaotic fire that the Frost Ferret anticipated didn’t reach the Four Symbols Secret Realm. It couldn’t take advantage of the chaos to escape.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not react after he heard the story. He just wanted to laugh.</p><p>Too tragic!</p><p>For the sake of its freedom, Elder Han had truly racked its brains that lacked spiritual light and squeezed its already dull brain dry.</p><p>However, how could it possibly win against those filthy people from the Holy Divine Palace?</p><p>It was normal that it couldn’t come out.</p><p>If it could take advantage of the chaos to come out, it wouldn’t be bullied by the Inner Island’s ghost beasts in the future. Instead, it could become the Elder Han that everyone respected.</p><p>“The second is a secret.” Aunt Xiang continued.</p><p>” After the Ran Ming ruins were destroyed by the Frost Ferret, the Holy Divine Palace realized that the ghost beast itself was not strong, but it was too big of a threat. It was like…”</p><p>Aunt Xiang subconsciously glanced at the young man opposite her. She couldn’t keep her mouth shut and blurted out, “A sh*t stirring stick.” “Anyway!” She hurriedly raised her voice.</p><p>“In short, the Frost Ferret was about to be banished to the Inner Island. It seemed to have realized that something was about to happen and it continued to create the utmost chaos. It just want to cause some accidents.”</p><p>“Before it entered the Inner Island, perhaps the aura of the Ran Ming ruins had disturbed something, or perhaps the Frost Ferret’s special talent had sensed something…”</p><p>“Without the knowledge of the Holy Divine Palace, it discovered the biggest secret of the Four Symbols Secret Realm!”</p><p>“What secret?” Xu Xiaoshou was really curious now. Elder Han was really good at putting on a show..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
