(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“Ran Ming Ruins…”</p><p>When he saw how the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit bullied and weak and feared the strong, Xu Xiaoshou focused on the terms mentioned by Bazhun’an.</p><p>Vaguely, he smelled the odor of a pit.</p><p>He still remembered that when he released Elder Han in the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes, he had obtained some information about the Ran Ming</p><p>Ruins.</p><p>God Slayer Ran Ming seemed to know void general Hong whom he had a contract with.</p><p>It was said that his power was even greater than the ten ancestors, and it had the power of the ancestral source.</p><p>After he was done at the Eighth Palace, Bazhun’an made a move and and arranged a follow up for himself – that was the Dongtianwang City-Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>Coincidentally, the Ran Ming Ruins was in the Four Symbols Secret Realm!</p><p>As for the three keys to open the ruins, he still had one with him!</p><p>How could Xu Xiaoshou not be on guard?</p><p>“You…”</p><p>But before he could say anything, Bazhun’an turned around. “Don’t worry.</p><p>You’re now the second-in-command saint servant. I’ll discuss it with you.” Xu Xiaoshou frowned and became even more worried.</p><p>I just took over as the second-in-command saint servant, and I broke your finger. You won’t make things difficult for me, right?</p><p>No, no, this saint servant is in too much danger. If he had the ability, he would spread his wings and fly!</p><p>At this moment, Bazhun’an turned around and asked directly.</p><p>“This Ran Ming Ruins, how can you help me?”</p><p>The gray eyeball of the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit trembled, and a beam of light split apart from the chaos world and descended.</p><p>Bazhun’an’s expression changed. The Second World took the initiative to separate and did not resist the intervention of this power. He did not sense any killing intent.</p><p>The Heavenly Ancestor Light illusion transformed into a light curtain, and inside it, a dark, dilapidated, and dusty ancient land was revealed.</p><p>In this world that was still as vast as the giant kingdom, there was a very eye-catching wall.</p><p>The wall was vast and boundless, as thick as the ground. It was silver in color and engraved with complicated Path patterns. It was beautiful and magnificent, like a treasure.</p><p>The voice of the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit drifted down.</p><p>“The fate of all good is tied to this item.”</p><p>A wall?</p><p>How could a wall help?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked to the side in confusion. Even Kong Yuhen could not understand the purpose of this beautiful silver wall. Bazhun’an frowned as well, but he soon relaxed.</p><p>“This is not a wall…”</p><p>“What? If it’s not a wall, then what was it?”</p><p>“Shield.”</p><p>“Shield?”</p><p>This wall is a shield, are you blind or am I retarded?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not figure out how this silver wall that looked higher than the sky and heavier than the earth, could be a shield.</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>He suddenly thought of the average height of the void attendant and the excessive form of the void general after its release.</p><p>Since the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit wanted to protect Abyss Island, it should also be from the void race. It couldn’t be small, right?</p><p>Then this guidance shield…</p><p>“Not bad.”</p><p>Bazhun’an looked at Xu Xiaoshou’s expression and knew that this kid had realized something. He nodded and said.</p><p>“The Heavenly Ancestor is the supreme leader of the void race. It’s rumored that his head can support the sky and his feet can support the ground. It’s not a big deal for him to capture the sun and moon.”</p><p>“From our point of view, the Shattered Shield is incomparably huge. However, to the Heavenly Ancestor, it’s a perfect weapon.”</p><p>“However, I can’t lift such a thing. I’ll have to trouble you, the descendant to do it.”</p><p>Shattered Shield…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had heard of it.</p><p>Just like the Evil Sin Bow, it was one of the nine supreme divine weapons. It was one of the swords, sabers, spears, staffs, axes, hammers, daggers, bows, and shields.</p><p>However, he had never thought that it was the Heavenly Ancestor’s weapon in the past. It was so huge and so thick!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt dizzy when he looked at the scene again.</p><p>This was even bigger than the Berserk Giant he had maximized. How could a human lift it?</p><p>What ‘Fate of all good is tied to this item’? Why was it tied to this? Couldn’t it be tied to something normal?</p><p>You can just tie your shoelaces!</p><p>The illusion transformed by the Heavenly Ancestor Light quickly shattered. He did not say anything else.</p><p>But at this moment, even Bazhun’an could not help but think about such a</p><p>realistic problem:</p><p>Even if Xu Xiaoshou became the Heavenly Ancestor’s descendant, was he up to it?.</p><p>The Herb Garden of Divine Farmer had been moved by this fellow, and he currently consumed the Dragon Apricot…</p><p>After the Four Divine Pillars, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s Holy Emperor power was given to him…</p><p>He himself had the bloodline of a giant and was suspected to be a descendant of the Abyss Clan…</p><p>These were all methods that could enhance one’s physical strength. Bazhun’an discovered that.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t move the Shattered Shield, then in this world, other than the actual members of the Abyss Clan, only the Divine could move it.</p><p>However, the Divine was also at the Cross Corner Street and could not come out.</p><p>Bazhun’an looked up, raised his hands and swept it downward. In the end, they landed on shoulder. His mouth twitched as he said.</p><p>“Believe in yourself.”</p><p>“At the very least, I believe in you.”</p><p>You?</p><p>You can pull it down!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not buy it. He began to think of a special way to escape from the storm vortex.</p><p>Weng!</p><p>The chaos world suddenly shook, and some ripples spread out.</p><p>“My time… Not much…”</p><p>In the void, the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit’s eyelids drooped again. It was very obvious that it was tired, and its voice became intermittent.</p><p>“I’ve asked all that I needed to ask.” Bazhun’an looked at Xu Xiaoshou.”Do you have any questions?”</p><p>I have a lot of questions!</p><p>However, it was obvious that the eye could not give any answers or useful content in its current state. Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and chose to pass this opportunity to someone who needed it more.</p><p>“Then it’s your turn.” Bazhun’an looked at Kong Yuhen.</p><p>Kong Yuhen, who had remained incognito throughout this time, waved his hand, and the chaos world stopped..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
