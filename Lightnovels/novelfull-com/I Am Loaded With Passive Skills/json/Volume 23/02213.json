(3)</h1><p>Chapter 2213: If I Am Born, There Will Be No Lasting Peace! (3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio     Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>If fundamental changes were not made, the blooming flowers would remain nothing but delicate greenhouse playthings, devoid of the wild fragrance.</p><p>Humans, too, were animals, inherently possessing passion and wild instincts. How could one truly sever their fangs and claws?</p><p>The Water Ghost remained silent.</p><p>He knew this was the answer he sought, the original aspiration of his cultivation.</p><p>And now, through a conversation between Xu Xiaoshou and Bazhun’an, his answer was revealed.</p><p>“Is this the Struggle for the Great Path?” Gazing at the wounds scattered across Abyss Island evoked a mix of emotions in Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Bones and corpses sprawled across the land; nations shattered…</p><p>The echoes of resentful spirits and unfulfilled regrets wove into a mournful wind, while the weak and self-deprecating turned into bitter fruits…</p><p>Gods fought among themselves, and mortals suffered.</p><p>If Abyss Island was like this, what storms would the Struggle for the Great Path unleash upon returning to the Shengshen Continent?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried not to dwell on matters that were of little concern to him. At this moment, he focused only on himself and those around him.</p><p>Nevertheless, Bazhun’an’s words stirred him, adding a touch of confusion and perplexity.</p><p>Bazhun’an looked at the young man, as if seeing his past self, and said with a smile, “I once had the same confusion as you. Or rather, as long as one is human, possessing humanity, they must have pondered over such thoughts…”</p><p>“But Xu Xiaoshou, you are mistaken.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his head with puzzled eyes.</p><p>“They are not innocent!”</p><p>“People die for wealth, birds perish for food. Their fate dictates that they will fall here. Even if they escape this ordeal, tragedy awaits them.”</p><p>“Risk and opportunity coexist; it’s their choice, and it has nothing to do with you. Self-blame won’t make you more enlightened; it will only bind your heart to the self, breeding delusions.”</p><p>After a moment of confusion, Xu Xiaoshou felt as if scales had fallen from his eyes.</p><p>Yes, along the way, which person he had slain didn’t flirt with death?</p><p>From Wen Chong, Feng Kong, Shao Yi, Zhang Xinxiong, Zhang Taiying, and the entire Zhang family…</p><p>From Red Dog, Double Dumbasses, Golden Foot, the major assassins of Three Incenses, to Yi, Rao Yaoyao, and even those who came close to death in his grasp like Teng Shanhai, Jiang Buyi, Yan Wuse…</p><p>Who hadn’t beckoned for the touch of death?</p><p>Everyone was fighting for their own interests, might makes right. Where was there room for mercy?</p><p>“I understand.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Bazhun’an and, at the same time, understood a lot.</p><p>He looked at the command token in his hand and suddenly realized why Bazhun’an had said so much to him.</p><p>This guy clearly disliked trouble and looked down on everyone, including himself…</p><p>“What’s the meaning of this?” Xu Xiaoshou lifted the command token.</p><p>“You’ve figured it out already.”</p><p>“But that’s your master’s token. I’m just returning it to you for safekeeping. You should be able to protect it now.”</p><p>Bazhun’an said, pulling out another command token from his chest. This command token was black, with the emblem of the Saint Servant on the back and the character “Shou” on the front. The Water Ghost’s expression changed.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong raised his eyebrows.</p><p>Mei Siren froze with a paper fan in hand, showing a hint of surprise.</p><p>Zhu Yike looked at the command token, and his eyes began to shine.</p><p>Bazhun’an handed over the “Shou” command token and said with a smile:</p><p>“Before this, our relationship was merely a simple coercion. For the Saint Servant, you were still in the assessment phase.”</p><p>“In the battle on Abyss Island, I saw your growth and ability to take the helm with confidence.’</p><p>“The First Pavilion in the Sky can naturally stand alone, but it still needs the support of the Saint Servant in various aspects.”</p><p>“The vacancy left after Sleeveless’ departure also needs to be filled… and I think you can now rise above opposition and suppress all dissenting voices.”</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at the familiar yet unfamiliar black command token, then looked at Bazhun’an in disbelief.</p><p>Still holding out the token, Bazhun’an cleared his throat, and with a serious yet somewhat playful expression, said:</p><p>“Now, I, Bazhun’an, formally extend an invitation to you!”</p><p>“Lord Shou, I have already forged your seat.. Would you deign to come to my</p><p>Saint Servant and grace us with your presence?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
