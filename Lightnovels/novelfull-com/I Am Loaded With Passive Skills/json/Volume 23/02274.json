Even the Heavenly Ancestor chose me. Are you nobler than the Heavenly Ancestor?”</p><p>This slap and candy bait were mixed together. The Dragon Apricot Spirit did not know how to deal with it for a moment. It only opened its mouth slightly and was about to speak.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou poured a bucket of dragon blood on it.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit immediately cried out in pleasure.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled. “If you don’t say anything, I’ll take it that you’ve agreed. I guarantee that I’ll have enough dragon blood. I’ll pick a handful of Dragon Apricot fruits first.”</p><p>Swish.</p><p>With a slash of his sword, a total of ten Dragon Apricot fruits dropped to the ground.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not seem to have made any moves. With a spatial fluctuation, the items were gone.</p><p>“Human!!”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit reacted and flew into a rage.</p><p>However, would Xu Xiaoshou pander to its wishes?</p><p>Now that I’m up and in my territory, even the dragon and trees would bow down for me. What’s the point of being arrogant?</p><p>Do you really think you’re the boss? I dug up a herb garden and still have to support you for the rest of your life?</p><p>He was already prepared, so he picked up another bucket of dragon blood and splashed it all over the dragon.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit felt so comfortable that it roared again as if Xu Xiaoshou had drugged it. However, there was anger in its pleasure, and it was obviously not satisfied with this.</p><p>Two buckets!</p><p>You’ve cut down ten Dragon Apricot fruits and you only gave me two buckets of dragon blood? What’s the meaning of this?</p><p>Even if it agreed, it shouldn’t only be this amount, right?</p><p>However Xu Xiaoshou ignored it. After he got hold of the Dragon Apricot fruits, he threw the bucket away and disappeared.</p><p>“Thank you, Senior Dragon Apricot. It’s not advisable to drink too much blood in a day. I’ll come back and give you a refill after I’ve used up all my Dragon Apricot fruits. You should rest first.”</p><p>By the time the Apricot Dragon Spirit came back to its senses, Xu Xiaoshou had fled so far away that it could not even sense his aura.</p><p>“Human!!! ”</p><p>“Phew, that was scary but not dangerous.”</p><p>After he flashed to the other side of the Yuan Mansion world, Xu Xiaoshou heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p>He was still a little afraid of the Nine Great Ancestral Trees. After all, they had their reputation and it was really difficult for him to make a move at that time.</p><p>However, the Dragon Apricot Spirit was indeed strong on the outside but weak on the inside. At most, its combat strength was equivalent to that of a demi-saint. Xu Xiaoshou had feared it previously, but now he was not afraid at all.</p><p>Moreover, it didn’t look like it wanted an open confrontation. With this in mind, Xu Xiaoshou was determined that he would outsmart the Dragon Apricot Spirit.</p><p>“Good stuff!”</p><p>As he held the Dragon Apricot fruit in one hand, Xu Xiaoshou’s Adam apple bobbed a little. He was both excited and scared.</p><p>When one consumed this item, it could really make one feel as if he could ascend to Heaven!</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that time waited for no one, he really wanted to undergo a slow upgrade. He would spend half a year or so to enjoy these ninety-eight portions of happiness unique to the Dragon Apricot fruits before he refined the power of the dragon ancestor.</p><p>However, since he was in the Central Region, the name ‘Dao Qiongcang’ made Xu Xiaoshou feel a little breathless.</p><p>“Not only do I have to consume it as soon as possible, but I also have to maximize the medicinal strength of the Dragon Apricot fruit.’</p><p>“I wonder if the Dragon Ancestor’s power will clash with my Heavenly</p><p>Ancestor’s power when it appears. I feel that theoretically, it will, unless there’s a special medium like the God Devil Eyes?”</p><p>“Perhaps this was also the reason why the Lei family was destined to disappear. The higher void was actually able to accommodate the dual power of the ancestral source… Uh, I don’t want to think about this.”</p><p>“It would be best if the dual power of the ancestral source did not explode in my body and I can compress them into source seeds and give them to my enemies.”</p><p>“I’m afraid that even my energy reserve cannot withstand these two great forces…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered for a moment, and his eyes lit up.</p><p>Actually, there were no lack of solutions!</p><p>To maximize the effects of the Dragon Apricot fruits, he naturally needed the Holy Emperor Lv.o Breathing Technique.</p><p>If he wanted to absorb the power of the Heavenly Ancestor as quickly as possible and control the power of the Heavenly Ancestor and the Dragon Ancestor at the same time, the method was the same as above.</p><p>At present, the strength in his body was overloaded and he was about to explode. He could not attack because his mental cultivation method could not keep up.</p><p>His Breathing Technique was only at Sovereign Stage Lv.l. It would take him a long time to transform a high-quality power like the power of the ancestral source into his own and even then he was not sure if it would work.</p><p>“Then let’s just do it!”</p><p>As soon as he had this thought, Xu Xiaoshou glanced at his inventory and planned to upgrade his Breathing Technique first.</p><p>He was already so strong that he was not afraid of being captured and cut into pieces for research. Now, his brain was more important than his strength.</p><p>“Passive Points: 6562544.”</p><p>Ever since his Weaving Expertise, Sword Technique Expertise reached the Holy</p><p>Emperor level, Xu Xiaoshou had basically not touched this Passive Points bank.</p><p>In the middle, there had been an increase of more than three million, and the majority of it was due to the damage caused by the power of the Four Divine Pillars.</p><p>Of course, the battle with the demi-saints and the Holy Emperor, the slaughter in front of everyone in Yunlun, and the discussion after he entered the Jade Capital City had increased his Passive Points.</p><p>“This is only the beginning…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could imagine the number of Passive Points he could earn in the Jade Capital City, a place with so many people and so many powerful Spiritual Cultivators.</p><p>However, this would be at a later stage.</p><p>At the moment, it was imperative that he leveled up.</p><p>The Sovereign Stage Lv.l Breathing Technique was already very powerful. Xu Xiaoshou tried to stop the constriction of his pores and went all out with his Fire Power.</p><p>The spiritual energy in the Yuan Mansion world instantly surged and quickly formed a large cocoon around Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>In fact, if Xu Xiaoshou had completely released his energy in the Shengshen Continent, he could probably achieve the same effect. However, it would take a longer time, and of course, it would be too eye-catching.</p><p>But even so, this Breathing Technique was unable to transform even the slightest bit of the Heavenly Ancestor’s power in the energy reserve.</p><p>“This quality is too high…”</p><p>He looked into his energy reserve and checked the power of the Heavenly Ancestor that he had inherited. Xu Xiaoshou was still shocked.</p><p>If the energy reserve was a palm-sized ordinary disk, the power of the Heavenly Ancestor was a Heaven Mending Stone that was the size of a human head. The energy within was condensed and compressed to the extreme, and the excess flowed into the body and remained until one was about to explode..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
