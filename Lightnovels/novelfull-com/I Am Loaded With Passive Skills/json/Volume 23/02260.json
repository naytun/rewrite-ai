People could run away, but certain things had to be left behind.”</p><p>“At this point, the two geniuses had completely fallen. They had remained silent for decades and had been completely surpassed by everyone in their generation. The hero is dead!”</p><p>After a pause, Aunt Xiang seemed to have thought of something and burst out laughing.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you know what. The funniest thing was that it had been sixteen years already, and the two of them should have been trapped together in the Dead Sea. I wonder if they will fall in love with each other after such a long time… Haha, I can’t take it!”</p><p>Aunt Xiang laughed so hard that her body shook all over. She held her chest, and it seemed her tears were about to flow out.</p><p>Perhaps this was an ill-fated relationship.</p><p>Heaven’s joke started with the foot-washing in the spring and ended with the waters in the Dead Sea.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned, thinking, “Old Gou was still in the Dead Sea. This guy must have led a tough life, right?”</p><p>When Aunt Xiang wiped away the tears from the corners of her eyes and sobered up a little, Xu Xiaoshou asked again.</p><p>“What about the others? What about the other three of the five? They managed to escape?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, this is actually a sad story…” Aunt Xiang’s smile disappeared, and she even looked a little embarrassed.</p><p>“Sad, so why was there still a smile on your face? So, it was all gone, right? In the end, the entire Fen Qin was completely destroyed, and not a single person was left alive,” he thought.</p><p>“Didn’t you guys absorb the bits and pieces of Fen Qin?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>Aunt Xiang shook her head. “That’s just some of the remnants that they haven’t found outside of He Ting Mountain. It’s just some scattered pieces…” Oh, but to us, it was a big deal. Now, you should know how terrifying your Master was back then, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was silent.</p><p>Was Fen Qin’s peak period so terrifying?</p><p>That Old Gou had ended it, and now he had fallen to such a state. It could only be said that the Holy Divine Palace was no good place for people.</p><p>“Oh, right, there were also rumors that Old Gou didn’t kill all of them, and the</p><p>Five Evil Guys were only crippled but not dead.”</p><p>“But no one knew exactly who managed to escape.”</p><p>“If you have time, why don’t you go to He Ting Mountain and take a look? Perhaps you can find some clues?” Aunt Xiang did not know if these rumors were true.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head slightly and did not comment.</p><p>Elder Sang hadn’t been found after so many years; that meant that his brothers from back then were definitely gone.</p><p>If he didn’t look for it, it meant that he didn’t dare to. This meant that there was an inescapable trap that awaited at He Ting Mountain.</p><p>“Wait a minute! Elder Sang really couldn’t go over, but I could. I’m completely clear…” Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have realized something.</p><p>Perhaps as long as Elder Sang was not sent to the Eighth Palace, there would be such a link in his plan:</p><p>When he grew up, he would look for his old friend and take over his gang.</p><p>Unfortunately, Elder Sang had departed earlier. At that time, he was still a rookie and was not qualified to know about this.</p><p>“He Ting Mountain…” Xu Xiaoshou tucked this name away in his memory.</p><p>“Alright, I’ve finished my narration from the start to the end. Are you happy now, Lord Shou? I don’t dare to hide anything from you. If you need anything, let me know!” Aunt Xiang blew a kiss at him and turned around to leave.</p><p>“Thanks.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stood up to send her off. Suddenly, he remembered something. “By the way, I haven’t paid you for Xu Gusheng’s treat!”</p><p>Since she had told him everything she knew, he naturally had to return the favor and show his respect.</p><p>“That’s not necessary. Just take it as a welcome gift from Aunt Xiang for your visit to the Central Region!” Aunt Xiang smiled sweetly.</p><p>“Sure, I’ll give you another thing. Consider it a business partnership.” Xu</p><p>Xiaoshou waved his folding fan and said proudly, “I’ll modify your Drunken Immortal Brew and write out the recipe for you. I guarantee that it will sell well. ”</p><p>Wine recipe?</p><p>Aunt Xiang’s eyes lit up as she recalled that the sickly young master was a Sovereign Stage Elixir Master.</p><p>He was able to taste the raw materials of the Drunken Immortal Brew just after one sip, and he got most of it right.</p><p>“Okay, then write it. Aunt will take a look.” She took a pen and paper from the table and said, “If it sells well, I won’t take advantage of you. Let’s split it fifty-fifty.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled and did not say anything. He dipped his brush in ink and began to write.</p><p>“Immortal osmanthus spiritual aura… This can be replaced with the golden fortune root of the rhizome plant. The quality of the elixir would drop from first grade to fifth grade, but the taste won’t be much worse.”</p><p>“Golden Sky Root, Mulberry Purple Leaf, Red Macaque Fruit…These ingredients can remain, but the ratio has to be changed according to my current recipe, three to nine to one.”</p><p>“You guys are quite particular about the use of the original recipe. There’s no need to change it. It’s still Mizao Spring water… Hmm?”</p><p>At this point, Xu Xiaoshou paused for a moment, and his entire body suddenly</p><p>froze.</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>Mizao, Mizao Spring?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
