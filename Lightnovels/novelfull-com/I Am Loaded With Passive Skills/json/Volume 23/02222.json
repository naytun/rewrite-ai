(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“If it’s well aware, the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit will recognize that this is its last chance.”</p><p>“Wait! Slow down!” Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly waved his hand and shouted for them to stop. He was almost dizzy from what he had heard. This fantasy-like plan seemed to be full of loopholes!</p><p>“Not to mention that the former Abyss Island Spirit had already fallen. It’s impossible for it to respond…”</p><p>“There should be a follow-up to your statement.”</p><p>“However, I remember that the Abyss Island Spirit did not have much spiritual intelligence…”</p><p>“Since it was able to pass on its legacy to you, it should have the characteristics of a live being. Don’t underestimate it.”</p><p>“Then, since the Abyss Island Spirit really has a will, it might be able to sense what you just said…”</p><p>“Do you think that the five Holy Emperor aristocratic families would be able to back it up? Even the Rao clan’s Holy Emperor dared to invade.”</p><p>“Ugh! You… Uh, um… What you said seemed to make sense, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t expect Bazhun’an to come up with something so reasonable in such a ridiculous plan.</p><p>He came back to reality and asked, “But in your current incapacitated condition, can you form a contract with the secondary plane door?” He glanced at Bazhun’an’s fingers.</p><p>The latter didn’t say anything and only displayed his bandaged10 Sections of the Finger Sword.</p><p>Sword cognition flickered on each sword finger.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was enlightened.</p><p>Sword cognition, Penetrating Divine Senses 2.0!</p><p>It was a power that was superior to the Holy Power and was said to be on par with the power of the ancestral source when cultivated to the extreme!</p><p>Bazhun’an didn’t have the Holy Power, and he was not a demi-saint either. He was only an Acquired Stage Spiritual Cultivator.</p><p>However, when he used the sword cognition to form a contract with the secondary plane, it would only be better and would not fail.</p><p>“That’s true. What was I thinking…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed at himself. This guy looked useless, but that was only on the surface. If the power in his body was really released, it would probably drown the entire Abyss Island!</p><p>“You still have any further questions?” Bazhun’an asked.</p><p>“I…” Xu Xiaoshou indeed felt that he still had many questions. This plan did not seem to be feasible at all.</p><p>However, when he saw how calm and confident Bazhun’an was, he thought</p><p>that it was indeed impossible to clear the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy through the normal method.</p><p>Perhaps it could be used. Bazhun’an had already tried it…</p><p>“Since he won’t take the soft approach, then we can only use the tough method.” Xu Xiaoshou chuckled. “I have no more questions.”</p><p>“Then it’s just you left.”</p><p>Everyone’s gaze followed Bazhun’an’s and fell on Kong Yuhen.</p><p>Although he couldn’t understand what Ba and Xu discussed, it seemed like something terrifying.</p><p>Zhu Yike was the only one who remained silent. It seemed that he would rather be somewhere else as he muttered silently.</p><p>“So you can still make use of threats…”</p><p>Kong Yuhen did not show any signs of being under pressure or being pushed away. He only smiled and asked, “Mr. Bazhun’an, if I really do this, what answer can I get from you?”</p><p>“I only said ‘it would be worth it’, that could mean that your efforts might be in vain, so you can choose not to cooperate.” Bazhun’an naturally wouldn’t let himself be pressured, even if Kong Yuhen was the most indispensable part of their plan.</p><p>However, he would still say what needed to be said.</p><p>“The road is under your feet. Whether you want to walk on it or not is up to you.”</p><p>“It’s to step into the abyss and die without a burial place. It’s to walk into the paradise and savor the birds and flowers. It’s to stay where you are and enjoy a peaceful heart… Your feet belongs to you, so you have decide for yourself.” “Mr. Bazhun’an is truly a wonderful person.” Kong Yuhen sighed and shook his head.</p><p>He always looked ahead and could not afford to rest on his laurels now.</p><p>He thought that he could use this matter to extract a promise from Bazhun’an even if he couldn’t get an answer from the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit. He didn’t expect that the others could see through it even more clearly.</p><p>Whether you wanted it or not, he already knew.</p><p>“Come, I will do my best, but I will need to borrow the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff.” Kong Yuhen turned and said.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou handed over the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff without a second thought. It just so happened that the staff was in his hand. How magical was that.</p><p>“At this moment, no one else can see it, but you might be able to see the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit. As for what you want to ask, whether it will answer or not, that has nothing to do with me.” Bazhun’an added.</p><p>Since others had tried their best to help, he would naturally help as well.</p><p>It was a pity that his old friend was no longer around. This was a brand new</p><p>Kong Yuhen.</p><p>hearts palpitated when they saw them looking into the distance.</p><p>“Heavenly Ancestor, is that a God?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“If we anger God in this manner, we… will we really succeed?”</p><p>“If it fails, we won’t do it?” “What if it really failed?”</p><p>“Then it will fail, but it will die.</p><p>What about us… Xu Xiaoshou wanted to ask more, but Bazhun’an turned around with a smile.</p><p>“Are you afraid?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment, then he shook his head slightly.</p><p>“No, I just… I’m a little excited..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
