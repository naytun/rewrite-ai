(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>The gray eyeball of the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit focused and glanced at the source of power that helped him maintain his consciousness.</p><p>“Senior, I have a question.” Kong Yuhen was very polite.</p><p>At that moment, Xu Xiaoshou clearly saw a hint of a playful glint flash through the Heavenly Ancestor’s gray eyes.</p><p>“I’m… not… senior…”</p><p>What did he mean by that?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t understand.</p><p>Kong Yuhen was also quite taken aback, but he did not dwell on this. Instead, he changed the topic and asked.</p><p>“Who am I?”</p><p>This was truly a philosophical question!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the amnesiac who had inherited the two images of time and space, and then at the drooping eyes of the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit. He eagerly awaited the answer.</p><p>If even God could not give an answer, then Kong Yuhen probably never find an answer!</p><p>The deathly silence lasted for a long time.</p><p>The chaos world rippled once again.</p><p>When even Kong Yuhen’s power started to fail to stabilize this divine court, the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit’s gray eyeball regained a trace of vitality.</p><p>“Kong… Yu… Hen…”</p><p>His answer seemed like gibberish.</p><p>Both Bazhun’an and Xu Xiaoshou frowned at the same time as they sensed an unusual aura.</p><p>Kong Yuhen, extremely well-known!</p><p>During the battle on Abyss Island, Xu Xiaoshou had impersonated him. If the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit had paid attention then, he would definitely know his name.</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>His tone just now clearly indicated that he was already familiar with this name; it differed from how he stated the new names such as Bazhun’an and Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Combined with the phrase ‘I’m not a senior’…</p><p>Suddenly a ridiculous conclusion flashed across Xu Xiaoshou’s mind.</p><p>He looked at Bazhun’an, who was also surprised. The two of them looked at each other in silence.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The chaos world was on the verge of collapse. Calamity reigned everywhere.</p><p>This time, it wasn’t that the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit was angry, but that it had used up too much energy and was about to fall into a deep sleep again.</p><p>It was obvious that was all he could say.</p><p>Kong Yuhen was immersed in the answer to his question just now, as if he had learned something.</p><p>The Second World, that was based on the Divine Court, also began to collapse.</p><p>Just when everything was about to turn dark again, Xu Xiaoshou heard an intermittent voice.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>It was too difficult!</p><p>He couldn’t hear it at all!</p><p>Moreover, why did he suddenly speak again?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly recalled the way the void general and the Abyss Island</p><p>Spirit talked; it was the same as when he squeezed out toothpaste.</p><p>However, he could do nothing but let the voice fade from his ears.</p><p>At the critical moment, Xu Xiaoshou felt that the Time Ancestral Shadow Staff in his hand had disappeared. Clearly, someone was more anxious than him.</p><p>The collapse of the divine court stopped for a moment, and the three of them could vaguely hear the next few words.</p><p>“Also…”</p><p>“Trapped… ”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Heavenly Ancestor Spirit was too slow.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt dizzy. The divine court was gone, and he returned to Abyss Island.</p><p>“You are also trapped…”</p><p>“What’s behind it? His speech is too slow!”</p><p>Kong Yuhen could not relax. He had adapted well to the separation of the inner and outside world. He frowned and looked at Xu Xiaoshou, his eyes full of complaints.</p><p>“Wait, I’m about to split apart.” Xu Xiaoshou had a splitting headache. He held his head and took a long time to recover.</p><p>The few people beside him didn’t know what was going on. They looked on quietly at Kong Yuhen, who was deep in thought, and Xu Xiaoshou, who held his head.</p><p>In their world, after they heard Bazhun’an’s call, Xu Xiaoshou and Kong Yuhen were both shocked. In less than the time it took for an incense stick to burn, the two of them woke up again.</p><p>Of course, they must have experienced something. They might have seen the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit!</p><p>Not long after, the situation improved. Xu Xiaoshou regained his thoughts.</p><p>When he recalled the look of ridicule in the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit’s eyes, he waved his hand and said.</p><p>“I feel that he did not answer your question. He might have recognized you!”</p><p>“Try to put this sentence ‘Kong Yuhen, you are also trapped’… If you put them together, it only formed half a sentence; could it be a joke?”</p><p>A joke?</p><p>Kong Yuhen felt even more puzzled. “Why would he joke with me?”</p><p>Big brother, you are so awesome that you don’t even know it. Your true form is the spacetime dual Upanishad. You’re the kind that would even make Huang</p><p>Quan cry due to his greed… Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t say anything, so he stared at Kong Yuhen silently.</p><p>“Then tell me, what should come after the statement ‘Kong Yuhen, you are also trapped’? Kong Yuhen asked as he cupped his chin.</p><p>“Are you trapped too?”</p><p>Kong Yuhen was stunned when he heard that. He looked up and glanced at Xu</p><p>Xiaoshou, as if he did not expect human beings to have such amazing brain circuits.</p><p>“That is a possibility…”</p><p>You really thought about it?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou made this statement as a joke. He did not expect things to develop in this manner.</p><p>According to the way the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit spoke, there was a high chance that the statement would not be followed by ‘trapped’ or ‘difficult’.</p><p>“It should be trapped…”</p><p>“I think so too.” Only then did Kong Yuhen feel that he was on the same channel as Xu Xiaoshou. “But trapped by what?”</p><p>“What else could it be? Maybe he wants to tease you due to your glorious past.</p><p>Compared to him, your current state isn’t much better!”</p><p>“But why?” Kong Yuhen was stunned. “But he…”</p><p>“Hei, perhaps you…” Xu Xiaoshou gulped as he spoke to ease the pain in his head. Then, he smiled. “You’re also in trouble?”</p><p>“It’s unlikely to be the case, right?” Kong Yuhen held his chin and pondered. He felt that this did not seem to be the case.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>The secondary door plane opened again. This time, there was not much commotion. Only Bazhun’an stepped out.</p><p>“There’s no time for you to have any idle chatter. Get ready..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
