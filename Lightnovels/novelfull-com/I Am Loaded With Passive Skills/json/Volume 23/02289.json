The familiar feeling came again.</p><p>It was as if more than half of his strength had been stolen.</p><p>The back of the bald virtual image in front of him suddenly solidified and looked like a real person.</p><p>He braced himself and jumped out of the hole in the ceiling of the Yougui Pavilion without a word and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Human Realm Dao?</p><p>It must be the special ancient martial arts technique that could plunder the physical strength of others and rewrite one’s own form of existence!</p><p>But what was The Divine up to?</p><p>The second true body clutched his heart that had accelerated after it suddenly stopped beating, and looked at Aunt Xiang in shock.</p><p>He had a lot of questions, but it was obviously impossible to get the answers now.</p><p>Aunt Xiang did not turn around. She stared at the hole at the top and had a worried look in her eyes. “He’s always so impulsive.”</p><p>Outside the Yougui Pavilion.</p><p>“What happened here?” A man dressed in plain clothes who held a silver plate that was in good condition in his hand, looked curiously at the collapsed wall and asked casually as he approached.</p><p>The wood-type Spiritual Cultivator who was repairing the wall, and the Spirit Array Caster who was calculating how to maintain the spiritual array, glanced at each other, but didn’t reply.</p><p>Instead, a passerby who stood at the side and watched the show casually replied.</p><p>“I heard that a young master from the Eastern Region had a conflict with Ghostface from the Ghost God gang. He raised his sword and brought down a wall of the Yougui Pavilion. It’s a pity that I didn’t see the battle with my own eyes.”</p><p>“Eastern Region? Ancient Swordsman?”</p><p>“I don’t know. It’s possible…”</p><p>“Oh, oh, thank you. I’ll also take a look at how they cultivated the spiritual array and learn a thing or two. My dream is to become a Spiritual Array Caster.”</p><p>“Hey! If you can learn it with a single glance, would the Spiritual Array Caster still be so popular?” The passerby laughed and turned around to study it too. The plainly dressed man held the inter-spatial wheel in his hand and quietly began to collect the traces of this battle.</p><p>As a member of the Transformation Division, it was common for them to collect information after the war.</p><p>This time, the new Chief took the lead to carry out the mission. He did not dare to slack off at all and wanted to show off.</p><p>Hehe, when this mission is over, I can go home and marry my little lady. Not far away, in a teahouse.</p><p>Xi, who was dressed in plain clothes, took off the robe and mask that covered his head and face and revealed a fresh and clean face.</p><p>The breeze caressed his face, and he enjoyed its cooling touch.</p><p>The waiter was busy inside, and the people around him kept an eye on the surroundings. He did not have to worry about being discovered or even being assassinated.</p><p>With a flip of his hand, a jade scroll appeared in his palm.</p><p>During the succession ceremony on the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, he couldn’t receive any information from the outside, nor did he have the time.</p><p>Now that he was free, he had a lot of things to deal with.</p><p>Xi instructed his men to keep a low profile. Then, he injected his spiritual source into the jade scroll and quickly read the latest information.</p><p>“Sword tower Li Fuyu entered the Jade Capital City. Zhao Ping’an, the captain of the city guards, was at the Sovereign Dao Realm. He had the Heaven Mystic Gold Plate that could block a strike from a higher void. He was killed by Li Fuyu with a casual sword strike.”</p><p>The Seven Sword Deity, Li Fuyu?</p><p>Xi’s expression became serious as he looked at the portrait that appeared in the jade scroll. He felt that this person looked very familiar.</p><p>He looked up.</p><p>Not far away, there was a woman with a sword who stood at the entrance of the Yougui Pavilion. Wasn’t that sword tower Li Fuyu?</p><p>The Seven Sword Deity had entered the city? Was there a problem?</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was in the Eastern Region… Elder Gu and Elder Yang were</p><p>nowhere to be seen. So they were also in Jade Capital City!</p><p>Was Li Fuyu here to challenge these two people for the sake of fame?</p><p>As his thoughts spun, Xi’s gaze fell on the slender white sword strapped to the plump woman’s waist. A light shone in his eyes as he muttered softly.</p><p>“Seven out of twelve of the sword tower, protect.”</p><p>At the Yougui Pavilion, Li Fuyu seemed to have sensed something and looked over.</p><p>Across the long street, a man and a woman, an adult and a young, looked at each other from afar.</p><p>The ancient swordsman exchanged glances with the other ancient swordsman, and that kind of hostility could not be concealed even if one tried to!</p><p>Xi’s eyes burned with a fighting zeal.</p><p>Li Fuyu’s vacant eyes also had a glimmer of spiritual light.</p><p>However, in the tea house, after he waited for a long time, Xi slowly stood up and took the tea and meat that the waiter handed over. He nodded slightly at the woman in the distance and looked away.</p><p>Li Fuyu’s momentum also stopped. It was obvious that this person did not want to fight at this moment.</p><p>“This Li Fuyu is very strong.”</p><p>“The Heaven Mystic Gold Plate is able to borrow a wisp of power from the great array. That’s also Hallmaster Dao’s array. She can even casually kill Zhao Ping’an with a sword… Yes, so casual..”</p><p>Xi sipped his tea and took note of Li Fuyu’s aura. After he set this matter aside, he looked at the next piece of information:</p><p>“Xu Gusheng, the descendant of the higher void in the Eastern Region and an anonymous disciple of the Burial Sword Tomb, entered the city. He requested to meet Aunt Xiang in the Yougui Pavilion. The Ghost God gang sent the Way of the Sword Feng Xiao, who was at the Sovereign Stage to cause trouble.</p><p>However he was repelled by his guard Jin Ren.”</p><p>“After that, the Ghost God gang led by Ghostface continued to stir up trouble.</p><p>Jin Ren used the 10 Sections of the Finger Sword to battle against Ghostface. Xu Gusheng destroyed Feng Xiao’s Dao heart in a Spear, Tongue Sword battle, and reconciled with Aunt Xiang.” “To be continued.”</p><p>10 Sections of the Finger Sword!</p><p>Xi’s mouth fell open. This Jade Capital City was really filled with all kinds of evil spirits and monsters. They even knew how to use the 10 sections of the Finger Sword technique.</p><p>I want to learn… After he sighed silently, he continued to read through the write up about Jin Ren.</p><p>“His Way of the Sword talent is outstanding, and his strength is extraordinary. He can be a candidate for a Sword Deity. His master, Xu Gusheng, has no intention to let his subordinate become famous, so he is limited.’</p><p>This Xu Gusheng really deserved to die… Xi hated this kind of master-servant relationship, especially when the servant was an ancient swordsman.</p><p>He immediately looked at Xu Gusheng’s introduction as he wanted to find out who this person was.</p><p>“He has an extraordinary heart energy, willpower, good vision and an agile mind. He handled Ghostface with such ease. He was not afraid as he had Jin Ren to protect him. He should have a great background. He is currently under investigation..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
