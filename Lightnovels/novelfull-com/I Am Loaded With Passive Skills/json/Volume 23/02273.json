From today and in the future, it was not allowed to secretly eat any of the herbs.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou really had no way to deal with this.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit had grown too fast. As the lord of the world, the barriers and spiritual arrays he had set up was regarded as energy and had been easily devoured by Greedy the Cat Spirit.</p><p>Even space was a type of energy, so what could stop Greedy the Cat Spirit?</p><p>If this little fat cat could break the seal today, it would be able to sneak in tomorrow!</p><p>Rather than that, it would be better to rein in Greedy the Cat Spirit before it became too rebellious, unlike a certain sword who was still timid and make a three-point agreement in advance.</p><p>After this kind of proper discipline, it would probably be able to put an end to any future problems.</p><p>As for the Dragon Apricot…</p><p>When he awoke after he received the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy, on the way to the Central Region, Xu Xiaoshou had made a deal with one of the Nine Great Ancestral Trees, the Dragon Apricot.</p><p>He did not have that much time to slowly exchange dragon blood for the Dragon Apricot fruits. It would be better to sacrifice some of them. He used all the dragon blood from the Gold-swallowing Dragon and three vats of the dragon blood from the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon to exchange for the ownership of the Dragon Apricot fruits on the crown of the Dragon Apricot Tree.</p><p>There were more than 300 of them!</p><p>This was actually not a worthwhile deal for Xu Xiaoshou. After all, the premium was too high.</p><p>If he really wanted them, he just needed to do a slow barter for them. Sooner or later, he would be able to squeeze out an appropriate amount of Dragon Apricot fruits for himself and the people around him to cultivate.</p><p>However, time was priceless. He was about to enter the Four Symbols Secret Realm, and Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t wait.</p><p>He had to eat 99 Dragon Apricot fruits as soon as possible to obtain the power of the dragon ancestor.</p><p>Previously, he didn’t know how powerful this ‘power of the dragon ancestor’ was. Now that his horizon had been broadened, Xu Xiaoshou thought, “This probably could be the power of the ancestral source, right?”</p><p>He did not know if it was complete.</p><p>However, it could be called that, and it was so rare. No one had cultivated it for thousands of years. No matter how incomplete this inheritance was, it couldn’t be weak.</p><p>Previously, he had only swallowed one Dragon Apricot fruit, and the increase in his physical strength was almost the same as that of the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch. Moreover, this increase was permanent.</p><p>If these 99 fruits were consumed, not to mention a qualitative change, just the results brought about by the quantitative change would be very impressive.</p><p>“Why did it feel like I’m collecting stamps…”</p><p>He thought about how he still had the power of the Heavenly Ancestor that he had yet to fully digest. As for the power of the evil god that was also the power of the Ancestor of Spells, he had also absorbed some of it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know whether it was good or bad for him to be so greedy.</p><p>However, Bazhun’an had acknowledged his path, and the resources were right in front of him. It would be a waste not to take them, right?</p><p>After he waited for a while, the Dragon Apricot still did not respond.</p><p>After all, this decision was a heavy price for Xu Xiaoshou to pay and was also a huge loss for the Dragon Apricot.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t accept that the transaction was unsuccessful. He quickly went forward and shook the Dragon Apricot vigorously.</p><p>“Senior Dragon Apricot, stop pretending to be asleep!”</p><p>“Wake up, I’m waiting for your answer. Don’t you just love dragon blood? I brought it for you.”</p><p>With a buzz, the dragon pattern on the tree trunk was activated.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit could no longer pretend to be asleep. It transformed into a beautiful spiritual physique of a golden dragon and entrenched itself on the Dragon Apricot.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit was a little annoyed now.</p><p>The last time they met, this human brat didn’t dare to be so impudent and rude.</p><p>This time, for some reason, he was not afraid of it, who was one of the Nine Great Ancestral Trees, at all. Its back stiffened.</p><p>“Human, don’t be greedy!”</p><p>“I’m not greedy. I’m being sincere, okay?” Xu Xiaoshou held a bucket of dragon blood and said with a smile.</p><p>He was indeed not afraid of the Dragon Apricot anymore.</p><p>He had seen and even fought against a Holy Emperor, and he had also experienced how the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit had been threatened.</p><p>This was just a mere spirit of the ancestral tree that had probably not fought for a long time. Its claws were blunt, and it only had a spiritual physique…</p><p>What was there to be afraid of?</p><p>The Xu Xiaoshou, who was a Sovereign Stage before used to be timid.</p><p>The Xu Xiaoshou, who came from Abyss Island, was so arrogant that he dared to punch anyone he saw. He even looked down on ordinary demi-saints.</p><p>He was still so polite?</p><p>This was just a display of his high quality.</p><p>“Senior, I have come sincerely to trade with you. If you are still unwilling to agree after so long…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou patted Hidden Bitter at his waist and said, “You saw how I underwent the sanctification earlier.’</p><p>He thrust his chest out again. “I believe you can sense the power in my body.”</p><p>“Give me an answer. You only have one choice.”</p><p>A threat?</p><p>The fury in the Dragon Apricot Spirit’s eyes almost spewed out.</p><p>What sanctification? That wasn’t even a saint calamity. It wasn’t even a scratch!</p><p>However, this human brat did have a point that made the Dragon Apricot Spirit a little wary. The power of the Heavenly Ancestor in his body was unbelievably strong. If it were to really erupt, the entire Yuan Mansion world would be buried with him, and even the Dragon Apricot Spirit would be severely injured.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw how the Dragon Apricot Spirit hesitated and he added more weight to his statement.</p><p>“We’re not on Abyss Island anymore. You’re homeless.”</p><p>“But if I took all your Dragon Apricot fruits and threw you to the mainland, you wouldn’t be able to catch up with me even if you wanted to. Then there would be a lot of demi-saints who would want to divide you up.”</p><p>“However, the result of a trade would be very different.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gestured at the bucket of dragon blood in his hand again and said happily.</p><p>“You only need to nod your head, and you can sleep as much you want in the future.’</p><p>“It’s useless for you to keep the Dragon Apricot fruits. You can’t possibly eat the fruits that you produced, right? This would be too boring!”</p><p>“And you know what my character is like. You can see that after I became stronger, I only killed more dragons to obtain their blood to show my respect to you.. Aren’t you going to consider these?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
