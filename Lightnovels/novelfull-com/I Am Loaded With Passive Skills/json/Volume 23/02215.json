(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart sank as he thought that something wasn’t right. He was about to reach out and cover the Eighth’s mouth, interrupting the enchantment.</p><p>But he had already spoken:</p><p>“Look at it from a different perspective; you’re actually above me!”</p><p>“You are the Tower Master of the First Pavilion in the Sky, towering above all.</p><p>Now, you graciously accept the position of second-in-command saint servant. This brings honor to all of us saint servants, doesn’t it?”</p><p>“I…” Xu Xiaoshou’s hand froze in mid-air. The interruption of the spell appeared to have rebounded.</p><p>At this moment, he couldn’t even hold onto the “Transformation” anymore. Grinning, he turned his gaze toward Lei Xi’er, pointing at Bazhun’an.</p><p>“He… He…”</p><p>“He’s quite eloquent!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er couldn’t contain her joy, feeling entertained by the spectacle these two were creating. But she calmly remarked, “You look like a fool right now.”</p><p>Indeed!</p><p>He did look like a fool!</p><p>Bazhun’an’s smooth talk and grand gestures made it glaringly evident that a huge trap lay ahead. How could he fall for it?</p><p>He had clearly tricked him numerous times.</p><p>Why was the impulse to willingly fall for it still so strong this time?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze swept across the faces of those around him. Finally, completely suppressing his emotions, mentally prepared to refuse, he looked at Bazhun’an.</p><p>“Lord Shou, are you truly not acknowledging this honor?” That damned guy spoke ahead of him!</p><p>“Regardless of anything else, consider it as doing me, Bazhun’an, a favor. Can’t you do that?”</p><p>Damn it!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t resist anymore.</p><p>After tapping into Bazhun’an’s clout so many times, he realized for the first time the terrifying power of this guy’s influence!</p><p>He was too good at it.</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou swore that not even Yue Gongnu could resist.</p><p>“Fine!”</p><p>“Today, I, Xu Xiaoshou, will do you this favor!”</p><p>From the inception of the First Pavilion in the Sky, it was impossible to truly break away from Saint Servant.</p><p>With the repeated sincere invitations, even a passerby could move Xu Xiaoshou, let alone Bazhun’an, whom he had benefited from so many times.</p><p>“I accept this token.”</p><p>“Even if you plan to trick me, I’ll take it in stride.”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Xu Xiaoshou grinned and accepted the command token.</p><p>Only when the cold command token was in his hand did he come back to his senses:</p><p>“But I have to tell you, if you go too far, I won’t hesitate to leave without a word!”</p><p>Bazhun’an…</p><p>What a terrifying mouth! He could even use the Fantasy Sword Technique without triggering Spirit Awakening, lifting people to the clouds!</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“How could this be?” Bazhun’an smiled and extended his hand, “Looking forward to a pleasant cooperation.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lowered his head, quietly staring at that hand with only four fingers.</p><p>This would be a historic moment!</p><p>For the companions of the First Pavilion in the Sky, as well as members who had yet joined the family, if they were to be deceived in the future…</p><p>“Don’t blame me!”</p><p>“Blame it all on Bazhun’an being too overbearing!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a long, deep breath, suppressing the turbulent waves within him. In front of everyone’s eyes, he forcefully gripped the hand extended toward him. “A pleasant cooperation…”</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>A strange sound echoed, and blood splattered.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared dumbfoundedly at the four fingers that he had forcefully detached with his right hand. His eyes lost their light in an instant.</p><p>A chill emanated from the earth and surged through the soles of his feet, rushing straight to the top of his head.</p><p>“Damn it!!!”</p><p>“I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to! I was too excited, I forgot you’re currently useless…”</p><p>“No, that’s not what I meant! I’m sorry, truly sorry…”</p><p>Once Xu Xiaoshou realized what had happened, he frantically apologized.</p><p>He even grabbed Bazhun’an’s wrist, hastily exhaling vitality spiritual energy as if nurturing a delicate plant, trying to reattach the remaining four fingers of the disabled man across from him. He wanted to restore his dignity and pretend as if the incident had never happened.</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>Another strange sound.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s voice abruptly stopped.</p><p>At this moment, his soul almost left its shell, and he could only stare blankly at the additional section of wrist in his left hand…</p><p>He looked back at his right hand, a pile of bloody fingers…</p><p>Then he looked at Bazhun’an’s face…</p><p>So serious.</p><p>Why-</p><p>The world fell silent, and a beautiful melody immediately played in Xu Xiaoshou’s mind.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>A chorus of gasps finally erupted from the side.</p><p>Mei Siren dropped his paper fan on the spot.</p><p>Lei Xi’er brought her hand to her forehead, covering her eyes at the same time.</p><p>The Water Ghost was stunned, taking steps backward in apprehension. He felt as though he had been plunged into the icy abyss of the Nine Serenities, freezing into an ice ghost.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong muttered “Amitabha” before falling backward. Instinctively, Zhu Yike reached out to catch him, and as realization struck, he too let himself fall to the ground.</p><p>Elder Han had never felt that the quality of his sleep was as good as it had been today. With a kick of his short legs, he fell asleep with a snore.</p><p>“Ha, ha, ha, ha.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed heartily at the sky four times, his laughter refreshing and domineering. “The weather is fine, the sky is clear, what a vast empty sky!”</p><p>He quickly stuffed the fingers from his right hand into his left palm and reached into the void.</p><p>“Ha, ha.”</p><p>“Everything will be forgotten; the past is but a wisp of smoke… Come out, my treasure! ”</p><p>Another reach.</p><p>“Ha, ha.”</p><p>“Where is my Time Ancestor Shadow Staff?”</p><p>Yet another reach.</p><p>“Although you can’t see it, it does exist.”</p><p>“This item was a gift from Kong Yuhen. Surprising, right? I, Xu Xiaoshou, and Kong Yuhen are acquainted. He’s that drunken moon…”</p><p>“Enough.” Bazhun’an coldly interrupted.</p><p>“I’m sorry, truly sorry, I didn’t mean to.” At this critical moment, Xu Xiaoshou, unable to summon his Time Ancestor Shadow Staff, felt utterly embarrassed..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
