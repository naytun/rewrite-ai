(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“That is Bazhun’an!”</p><p>These few words were filled with heroic spirit.</p><p>Everyone was relieved. It was as if they could see the Eighth Sword Deity who was in high spirits and defeated the world; they also saw the Bazhun’an who was down and out but was still happy and contented.</p><p>Regardless whether it was the Three breaths for innate stage, three years for Sword Deity celestial immortal or the Acquired Stage Spiritual Cultivation banished immortal.</p><p>From the phrase ‘How can I not be carefree’, one could see that his state of mind had never wavered.</p><p>Success and failure seemed to be nothing more than a life experience in his eyes, and both could be enjoyed.</p><p>Don’t be happy merely due to the beauty of things and don’t be sad due to one’s own failure.</p><p>This kind of indifferent and detached state came as a shock.</p><p>The Way of the Sword, the Way of Spiritual Cultivation, and even the 3,000 Great Path… Cultivators needed talent, perseverance, or luck.</p><p>But no matter what, the heart was the most indispensable.</p><p>“How can I not be happy and unfettered after I became a banished immortal?”</p><p>As the Spiritual Cultivators muttered these words to themselves, they understood why Bazhun’an was Bazhun’an and they admitted that they were inferior to him.</p><p>With such a Dao heart, even if he only used 30% talent and 30% effort, how could he not succeed?</p><p>This was what the Heavens favored!</p><p>Even if he, Bazhun’an did not cultivate the sword, he would still be able to achieve success in other Paths at some point, right?</p><p>“How can I not be carefree, how can I not be carefree…</p><p>In the air, the condescending Dao Qiongcang was silenced by his words, but even he wanted to applaud.</p><p>He really didn’t expect that his few sarcastic remarks would be so easily resolved and countered by Bazhun’an. However, after he thought about it carefully…</p><p>That’s true!</p><p>How could this guy be like any ordinary person and get flustered merely from a few words spoken by an outsider?</p><p>Unlike Rao Yaoyao’s emotional manifestations and Xu Xiaoshou’s flexibility,</p><p>Bazhun’an’s pride had never lessened, no matter how down and out he was.</p><p>From the words ‘banished immortal’, one could catch a glimpse:</p><p>He never thought that he had failed. He was in the mortal world for a temporary period to gain some experience.</p><p>When the time was up, he would soar to the sky.</p><p>“The incident back then really didn’t affect him at all?”</p><p>“Everyone thought that he had been in a decline for thirty years. Could there be a possibility… He just slowed down and chose another path of cultivation?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s thoughts drifted as if he had seen through Bazhun’an’s thoughts.</p><p>If it had been anyone else, he would never believe that anyone would take the initiative to make such a choice and choose to remain silent.</p><p>If it was Bazhun’an, anything was possible.</p><p>Then, what was it that made Bazhun’an, who was known for his ‘Three breaths for innate stage, three years for Sword Deity’, willing to give up his rapid advancement. He chose to spend more than thirty years to settle down as he waited for his accumulated strength to be unleashed and amaze the world?</p><p>After Dao Qiongcang’s thoughts settled, his pupils dilated.</p><p>He shook his head slightly and sighed as he spoke to the person below. “Bazhun’an, oh Bazhun’an, how should I put it… one would expect that of you?”</p><p>“Then since it had come this far, do you think you can do that?”</p><p>What did Hallmaster Dao mean?</p><p>In the huge battlefield, no one understood the meaning of Dao Qiongcang’s remarks.</p><p>On the ruins, Bazhun’an only smiled slightly. He bent over the ruins and used his left hand, that only had four fingers, to pick up a fist of sand.</p><p>Everyone looked at him and did not understand his action. Even Dao Qiongcang was confused.</p><p>When Bazhun’an stood up again, he only gently released his four fingers and allowed the wind that blew over after the battle to carry away the sand from his fingertips.</p><p>When the sand had almost completely disappeared, a small, black insect that was devoid of any vitality breath appeared in his palm.</p><p>The world was quiet, and even the wind seemed to wait.</p><p>Bazhun’an gently caressed the cold black bug with his fingertips. He slowly closed his eyes and said in an indifferently tone.</p><p>“Dust and sand do not know what is stability, and insects are unaware of eternal life…Therefore, I don’t know how to discuss this matter with you.” “In your world, I’m too crazy. In my eyes, this is a normal step, a step forward for me.</p><p>Bazhun’an stepped out and looked up at his former opponent.</p><p>After a long time, he laughed involuntarily. In the end, he did not say anything more.</p><p>“How can summer insects have any vision? Measure others by their own limitations!”</p><p>“Think whatever you want!”</p><p>At this moment, apart from Dao Qiongcang, everyone could hear the disdain in Bazhun’an’s words.</p><p>I’ve long heard that the Eighth Sword Deity is crazy!</p><p>However, few people could imagine that one day, they were able to personally experience this wanton arrogance.</p><p>Even Dao Qiongcang, the unpredictable, was not from the same world in the eyes of Bazhun’an?</p><p>He actually thought that Dao Qiongcang could not understand him because his level was not high enough?</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>All the spectators in the arena gasped, and they couldn’t help but be even more curious about what Bazhun’an had planned.</p><p>What was it that even Hallmaster Dao could not accept?</p><p>It was bigger than the sky, harder to calculate and imagine than the situation on Abyss Island?</p><p>Only Lei Xi’er, who held Xu Xiaoshou, who slept soundly in her arms, vaguely understood Dao Qiongcang’s words.</p><p>She still recalled that after the battle in the Eighth Palace, the Saint Servants and the others had huddled in a dark cave.</p><p>At that time, Xu Xiaoshou was still under Bazhun’an’s guidance.</p><p>Lei Xi’er, who was still Mu Zixi, had eavesdropped on their conversation. When they talked about the meaning of ‘Unless you become a saint, you would always be a slave’, Bazhun’an stated the reason why he underwent sanctification:</p><p>“A Saint is too weak, and even the Holy Emperor can’t save him.”</p><p>“That’s why I want to become a God. When I draw my sword again, I will cut this filthy world into pieces..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
