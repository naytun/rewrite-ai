I shall give it a name.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally realized what was missing.</p><p>That’s right, it could no longer be called the ‘Yuan Mansion world’. It should</p><p>have a brand new name.</p><p>When he comprehended the sword in the rain, Xu Xiaoshou had gained a lot, so he did not care to compete with the Dragon Apricot for the naming rights.</p><p>He was happy to let the Dragon Apricot give a name to it.</p><p>In this way, the Ancestral Tree would feel more involved. In the future, it would work even harder to protect this world that had such amazing potential, just like how it was with Greedy the Cat Spirit conducting alchemy.</p><p>As for himself, it did not cost him anything…</p><p>“It is naturally up to Senior to decide. It is this world’s honor.” Xu Xiaoshou said seriously.</p><p>He could feel that the Dragon Apricot was delighted after it heard this.</p><p>It had obviously put some thought into this already and had a good idea for the name, but it still took its time to mull over it at this moment. After a long while, it said.</p><p>“Let’s call it the ‘Apricot Realm’!”</p><p>Apricot Realm?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up.</p><p>This name conveyed a sense of belonging and implied that a certain tree wanted to live here for a long time.</p><p>“What do you think?” The Dragon Apricot asked expectantly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not object. He immediately clapped. “Noble, very noble!”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot smiled.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at it and he smiled too.</p><p>“+(Agreed, Passive Points,+)l.”</p><p>Hidden Bitter suddenly cried out and and shook violently. Xu Xiaoshou looked at it in surprise.</p><p>He was all too familiar with this fluctuation. Would its level advance again?</p><p>Was it because he had used it to display half of the Wrath of the Great Crimson God and the Second World?</p><p>“Maybe, or could it be more than that?”</p><p>He thought about how Hidden Bitter had advanced quite quickly recently.</p><p>He was clearly at the fourth grade of the Sovereign Stage. When compared to the Innate or Master stage, he was worse off.</p><p>He immediately thought of the ‘names’!</p><p>Now, the names of the new Seven Sword Deity, Two Elders, Yi Xiao, Li Fuyu, Hua Lai, Bei Tian and favored Lord Shou, had spread and was known by everyone in the five regions.</p><p>Even Hidden Bitter’s reputation had grown.</p><p>It was also rumored that fame could nurture a famed sword. The broken sword, the Qingju Sword in the hands of Bazhun’an was one of them who had risen step by step from being weak to the supreme level.</p><p>It was likely that Hidden Bitter had a new breakthrough this time. This ‘name’ and the nourishment of the Way of Heaven was the main reason!</p><p>“Yes…” Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his chin.</p><p>Before this, he wasn’t as crazy about the title of Seven Sword Deity as the other swordsman. Now, he suddenly realized how powerful the ‘name’ was.</p><p>This thing was so powerful that even the ancient swordsman who was in seclusion would have to come out and fight for their names, right?</p><p>That’s right, didn’t you see how Mei Siren was so aloof…</p><p>“Sob!”</p><p>His thoughts were interrupted by the sounds of a struggle and Xu Xiaoshou turned to check.</p><p>This time, Hidden Bitter’s transformation was much slower and it was more anxious.</p><p>It was like a snake that wanted to shed its skin but was trapped within its own skin. After it twisted about for a long time, its rank still could not advance.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly noticed that a faint crack had appeared on Hidden Bitter’s sword body.</p><p>He was shocked. When he looked over again, he found that the crack had disappeared, as if it had been an illusion.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou realized that he was not just seeing things, he discovered something.</p><p>4th rank or 3rd rank…</p><p>In short, Hidden Bitter’s limit might only be the Sovereign Stage rank!</p><p>A famed sword could be nurtured by fame, but the quality of the sword itself had to pass the test?</p><p>Hidden Bitter had indeed been weak in the past. The technique and materials used to forge this sword were very crude.</p><p>It was not apparent when its rank was low, but now…</p><p>It was just like how previously, Bazhun’an was limited by his mortal body and had no choice but to rebuild an Indestructible Sword Body.</p><p>“Ouch!”</p><p>Hidden Bitter still struggled on.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could tell that it was unwilling.</p><p>Therefore, he raised the black sword and activated the Witness Sword Technique. His eyes glowed, and his fingertips formed a sword cognition that slowly stroked the sword body.</p><p>“Weng weng weng!”</p><p>Hidden Bitter’s sword body trembled violently.</p><p>The sword cognition that had awakened tried to invade Xu Xiaoshou’s body through his fingertips.</p><p>This force of this sword cognition was no longer as powerful as before, and it could not hurt Xu Xiaoshou’s body.</p><p>Or rather, the current Xu Xiaoshou was too strong. He could easily suppress the sword cognition, absorb it, and then spit it out to revitalize Hidden Bitter and help it to advance.</p><p>The cycle was repeated.</p><p>This process lasted for about 15 minutes.</p><p>When the sword finger finally touched the tip of the sword, Hidden Bitter let out a birdlike cry, and the sword body emitted a transparent black light.</p><p>“Ouch!”</p><p>It had broken through!</p><p>Third grade spiritual sword, Sovereign Stage!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was happy for Hidden Bitter.</p><p>His current combat strength had touched the peak of the Sovereign Stage and Hidden Bitter had also followed closely behind him to this position.</p><p>After he allowed Hidden Bitter to savor the moment, after a short while, Xu Xiaoshou had to bring it back to reality.</p><p>“It’s not that I want to criticize you, but you have to restrain your breakthrough for a while. Take it slow. Just treat it as cultivation of the Hidden Sword Technique.”</p><p>“Huh?” Hidden Bitter was puzzled. It had a high spiritual quality and did not have any problems to communicate well with its owner.</p><p>“Your quality is too poor, just like Bazhun’an who wanted to enter the Saint Realm without a sacred physique. After this advancement, I’m afraid that you’ll break after I use you to cast the second realm.”</p><p>“Sob…” Hidden Bitter was clearly depressed.</p><p>After Xu Xiaoshou comforted the sword, he began to think about this matter again.</p><p>Since even Hidden Bitter had this requirement, how could a famed sword be nurtured?</p><p>The era of the ancient swordsman had developed for so long, and there had been a Sword God since ancient times.</p><p>Then there must be a legend of an ordinary sword that wasn’t even at the ninth or tenth grade, and finally became a famed sword, right?</p><p>Wasn’t that the case with the Qingju Sword?</p><p>Did this not mean that the famed sword must have some way to grow rapidly with its owner without being limited by its own quality?</p><p>After all, those who could nurture a famed sword were not ordinary people. Their growth speed was definitely extremely fast, and the sword had to be able to keep up.</p><p>“Reforge?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou once again thought of Bazhun’an and thought that this was a feasible possibility. But soon, he frowned again.</p><p>Bullsh*t!</p><p>This was Hidden Bitter that was about to become a famed sword!</p><p>What if the spirit of Hidden Bitter was destroyed in the process of the reforging and rebuilding?</p><p>This idea could only exist in the era of the ancient swordsman. In the current world, who else had the qualifications to reconstruct a famed sword embryo like Hidden Bitter?</p><p>Just as he thought about this, Xu Xiaoshou received a message from his second true body in the outside world.</p><p>“Boss, you’ve caused a big problem again!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
