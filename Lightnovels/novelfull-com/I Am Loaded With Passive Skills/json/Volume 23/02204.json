(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“You…”</p><p>“It’s just a piece of advice. That’s all. It’s up to you whether you want to listen or not. ”</p><p>Bazhun’an waved his hands and interrupted Dao Qiongcang; it was obvious he did not want to say anything more.</p><p>Weng!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was about to argue when Abyss Island shook violently. The</p><p>Holy Emperor power gathered rapidly from all directions.</p><p>“Oh!” Lei Xi’er groaned as the white flames ignited on her body again.</p><p>Although the white flames could not harm her, it still contained the power of a Holy Emperor. Even though she had the Ultimate Life Demon Physique, she still had to endure the pain that accompanied the power.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had experienced this kind of pain personally, so he naturally knew what it was like.</p><p>He frowned, and the red Taotie Beast Head appeared behind him. It opened its mouth and swallowed all the power that appeared on Lei Xi’er’s body.</p><p>It gulped all the power heartily!</p><p>With a ‘dong’ sound, Lei Xi’er recovered instantly, but Xu Xiaoshou moaned in agony.</p><p>In the end, he could not suppress it anymore. His seriously injured body was healed quickly by this energy.</p><p>However, he noticed Lei Xi’er’s strange gaze. He quickly cleared his throat and said.</p><p>“You don’t have to come out. There’s only one harmless Dao Qiongcang left.</p><p>You’re not needed.”</p><p>The power on Lei Xi’er was none other than the Great Infernal Ancestor’s power.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had some guesses as to why the Great Infernal Ancestor didn’t dare to possess him.</p><p>Perhaps it was because it sensed danger- a similar danger to Feng Yujin’s Sealing Power with its spiritual intelligence that could invade his body, but was cut off by the Passive System.</p><p>Thus, during the Four Divine Pillars, the Great Infernal Ancestor chose Lei Xi’er.</p><p>It didn’t matter. It didn’t affect the final outcome.</p><p>Now that everything was over, Bazhun’an wanted to get rid of Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had a brief moment of glory, knew that he didn’t need to make such a big fuss to deal with a mere demi-saint, so he spoke up.</p><p>Great Infernal Ancestor’s power vanished without a trace, and it did not actually come out.</p><p>“Was I awesome?” Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows proudly. He quickly realized that this ice-cold face was no longer his little junior sister, so he turned away from her contempt.</p><p>“It’s just so-so…”</p><p>A voice as low as a mosquito’s buzz sounded in his ears.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s sense of hearing was so acute yet he almost did not catch what she said. He immediately glanced over. “What did you say?!”</p><p>The wind ruffled her silver hair so that it covered her side profile. Lei Xi’er stared intently at the distant battlefield. A great battle was about to break out. “Strange…” Xu Xiaoshou muttered softly. He wanted to shake off Lei Xi’er’s hand, but he couldn’t.</p><p>The vitality spiritual energy was being transmitted constantly through the warmth of her palms. It turned into the Breathing Technique Transformation and healed his injuries.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened his mouth and was about to speak.</p><p>A loud explosion occurred in the distance and interrupted what he wanted to say – ‘I have my own Spirit Mark of Life in my Yuan Mansion’.</p><p>“Long…”</p><p>When he looked up, he saw that the two people whose negotiation had failed, had launched their attacks without any hesitation.</p><p>Bazhun’an only used three-quarters of the power of the Four Divine Pillars, and Dao Qiongcang chose to self-destruct without any further ado!</p><p>Yes, self-destruction!</p><p>The explosion didn’t spread out, didn’t cause any strange changes, and didn’t hurt anyone.</p><p>Under the cover of a layer of the Divine Secret, all traces left behind by Dao Qiongcang on Abyss Island were erased.</p><p>The green chains raised by Bazhun’an naturally lost their target.</p><p>Ha, he ran so fast.</p><p>As he gazed at the black hole in front of him and sensed Dao Qiongcang’s gradually disappearing aura, Bazhun’an shook his head with a smile and did not pursue the matter.</p><p>It was impossible for him to take down Dao Qiongcang. He had expected this.</p><p>This guy had prepared countless trump cards for himself. He would not be like Wangze Holy Emperor who was caught after he met the attack head-on and damaged his own body.</p><p>He was very shrewd!</p><p>It could be said that he had never really entered this round and had protected himself well.</p><p>However…</p><p>If he didn’t enter this trap and was caught in the middle, where could he escape</p><p>Bazhun’an reached into his pocket and took out a telepathic communication stone. He looked at the huge black hole in front of him and then looked at the people who trembled in fear on Abyss Island.</p><p>It was time to end it.</p><p>After he injected his spiritual source, Bazhun’an’s body trembled violently, but he concealed this huge tremor very well and also kept the stone in his palm hidden.</p><p>The Taoist music was decadent and reverberated in all directions. This was also a piece of advice that Dao Qiongcang would not heed!</p><p>“Day to day dreams often come true.”</p><p>“If you want to be unfettered like me, you have enter the path of madness..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
