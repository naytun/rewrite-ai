How could they not be worried?</p><p>The Ninth Divine Priest paused for a moment and raised her hand. “The new Ruler of the red-clothed people is Yue Gongli.”</p><p>The noise settled down.</p><p>Everyone was slightly stunned.</p><p>They had never heard of this name before, let alone made a correct guess!</p><p>The eyes of the red-clothed people dimmed.</p><p>Another official who had been demoted?</p><p>One, they did not know what his battle achievements were and two, they didn’t know what his character was like.</p><p>The red-clothed people had taken decades to adapt to Rao Yaoyao, who had dropped from the sky but was still known as the Seven Sword Deity. This time, they had to put up with this big shot for another few decades?</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>However, at this moment, a cyclone on the Saint mountain rippled slightly, and the sand and stones shifted.</p><p>The sky seemed to darken a little, and one could vaguely see a hidden moon that hung in the Nine Heavens.</p><p>As the cold wind swept past, everyone’s attention was drawn to the man who descended from the sky and walked over, one step at a time.</p><p>It was too beautiful!</p><p>This man, who was as enchanting as a vixen, had long sky-blue hair that cascaded down and revealed his unrestrained nature.</p><p>He was extremely tall and well-proportioned. A gray mink sable was draped over his shoulder with one hand. His green robe was open to the chest, and fastened with a blue jade belt. It revealed his strong chest muscles and upper abdominal muscles, and gave people a sense of the beauty of his streamlined muscles.</p><p>He walked over from the sky with a smile on his face. His foxlike eyes were narrowed into slits. His every move carried a strong confidence and incomparable appeal that made the red-clothed people, who were slightly anxious, feel at ease.</p><p>“Greetings, everyone. I am Yue Gongli, a Yin-type demi-saint. My intelligence is outstanding, but I am slightly inferior to Dao Qiongcang.”</p><p>“As for me, my favorite color is blue. My favorite pastime is to make beautiful women cry. I like the number four. I like to eat sweets…”</p><p>“Of course, we have important matters to attend to. It’s my duty to capture the ghost beast!”</p><p>Under the dumbfounded gazes of the crowd, this social terrorist, who was such a stark contrast to Yu Zhiwen’s personality, walked up the jade steps and sat down after his lengthy introduction.</p><p>When he passed Dao Qiongcang, Yue Gongli turned around and swung the mink sable in his hand. The entry’s gorgeous special effect turned into a ray of light with a snap of his fingers.</p><p>At the same time, he stroked his long blue hair and was about to put the mink sable on his shoulder to complete the final entrance move that he had planned for three hours in advance.</p><p>“Pa ji.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang dodged sharply, and the gray sable slammed into Elder Yu.</p><p>The latter was in the midst of wiping away his tears as he stared at his Little Yu, who had grown up and transformed. He didn’t care about the person who came, but his vision suddenly darkened.</p><p>The Saint mountain fell silent.</p><p>“Clang. ”</p><p>Someone accidentally dropped his sword on the ground and was so frightened that he quickly picked it up.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was stunned, and so were the Chiefs of the six divisions.</p><p>Yue Gongli and the others were also stunned.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was taken aback as well, but he frowned. He had been alert and managed to avoid the mink sable when he deftly stepped aside in time.</p><p>“Yue Family brat!!</p><p>Three auras later, Elder Yu let out a furious roar.</p><p>He kicked off his slippers and picked up the extended fishing rod that was more than 10 feet long from the floor. He suddenly slashed it at Yue Gongli.</p><p>“Wow! Elder Yu’s trying to kill someone! Help!”</p><p>The blue-haired man who was as handsome as a fox spirit grabbed the mink sable and wrapped it around Elder Yu’s head.</p><p>After he blocked his line of sight, he spread his arms and fled for his life. His shiny black boots clattered on the floor.</p><p>“I didn’t do it on purpose!”</p><p>“Let me go, Elder Yu. The one I am after is Dao Qiongcang. I’ve disliked this flamboyant guy for a long time!”</p><p>“Wow, don’t chase me. It’s so embarrassing. This moment was supposed to be the highlight of my appearance… Wahhh!”</p><p>Everyone gasped. They glanced at Hallmaster Dao, who had retreated behind them, and then at Elder Yu, who chased after Yue Gongli with a long fishing rod. They felt as if something in their minds had shattered.</p><p>“I’ll let you run 17 feet ahead first! Then, let’s see if it’s your reaction that’s faster or my 18 feet fishing rod that’s slower!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>“Don’t hit me!” Yue Gongli screamed as he clutched his butt. “I’m a demi-saint!</p><p>A Saint cannot be humiliated! ”</p><p>“I’ll make sure you don’t get humiliated!”</p><p>Pa!</p><p>With the second sound, Yue Gongli flung out his arms and fled the scene in his black boots.</p><p>However, everyone’s spiritual senses could track his escape and they discovered that the direction that this fellow fled to was actually toward the east.</p><p>The east…</p><p>This was one of the forbidden grounds, the Land of Screen and Candles!</p><p>“No.” Someone among the red-clothed people exclaimed. After all, he was his superior. He just looked a little different. How could he die the moment he entered?</p><p>However, before he could stop him, Yue Gongli had already stepped into the Land of Screen and Candles.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>The Saint Mountain moved.</p><p>Xi’s eyes widened as he turned to look.</p><p>A black mass of sword energy flew out from the Land of Screen and Candles. Yue Gongli had sprained his ankle and brushed past his ear.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>Everyone outside gasped.</p><p>This was the first time they had seen this type of sword energy in decades…</p><p>He made a move?</p><p>He could make a move?</p><p>This holy will, Sword Saint?</p><p>“What the hell…”</p><p>Yue Gongli finally reacted. He stopped and stepped bravely again into the Land of Screen and Candles.</p><p>Elder Yu held his fishing rod and stopped outside. He didn’t chase after him, but his expression altered slightly.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The Holy Power exploded with a loud bang..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
