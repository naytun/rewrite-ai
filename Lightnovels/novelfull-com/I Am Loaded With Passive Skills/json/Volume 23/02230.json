(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“Get ready for what?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had just turned his head when he realized something and looked up.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A beam of light fell from the sky and knocked everyone away. It only enveloped Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“What’s this?” Water Ghost was so shocked that his hair stood on end. He almost thought that the Elder Dao the Flamboyant hadn’t left and had launched a covert attack with the Heavenly Ancestor Light. Bazhun’an waved his hand. “Don’t panic, this is the legacy.”</p><p>Heavenly Ancestor Legacy?</p><p>It appeared just like that?</p><p>Water Ghost couldn’t help being curious. He stared intently at Bazhun’an and waited for him to speak.</p><p>“We’ve met once and everything was settled. There’s nothing much to say.”</p><p>Bazhun’an was a man of few words. When he saw the ‘trapped’ Kong Yuhen, who was still calculating with his fingers, he laughed.</p><p>“Friend, aren’t you being too anxious?”</p><p>“Mr. Bazhun’an, I’m still…” Kong Yuhen finally woke up and looked at him in confusion.</p><p>“You don’t have to tell me that. I’m not interested. I can’t give you the answer to your question. You can only find and comprehend it yourself.”</p><p>“… I understand.”</p><p>“Go. There’s nothing here that would be of interest to you. You should start on your next journey. I hope you’ll gain something.”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>Kong Yuhen nodded and swept his gaze across the people present.</p><p>No one had any unnatural or subconscious reactions of being looked at or being observed. Everyone was happy.</p><p>Kong Yuhen’s gaze lingered on Xu Xiaoshou, who was shrouded by the light of the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy. He stretched his hand out as if he handed something over.</p><p>After he did this, he smiled brightly.</p><p>The wind whistled over Abyss Island. The reincarnation had given the world a new lease of life, and it was filled with the vitality of spring.</p><p>Kong Yuhen still stood there, but he disappeared after a while.</p><p>At this moment, for some reason, everyone suddenly felt bereft.</p><p>However, after a brief lull, everyone soon forgot about this unique feeling of loneliness.</p><p>It was as if no outsider had come here before. He had never told anyone his name.</p><p>Bazhun’an’s hands tightened, as if he had grabbed onto something. However, there was nothing in them.</p><p>“I’ll remember you this time, my friend.” He sighed deeply as he raised his head and shouted in the wind.</p><p>“Who were you talking to?” Water Ghost, Mei Siren, and the others were stunned.</p><p>“No one.” Bazhun’an was clearly irritated as he waved his hands and didn’t want to answer. He turned and saw that Xu Xiaoshou had the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff in his hand. His grip was so tight that the veins on his arm were clearly visible.</p><p>He turned around and said hurriedly, “Even if I can’t remember, he should be able to!”</p><p>After all, you didn’t give me this thing back then, my friend.</p><p>The wind continued to howl through the land.</p><p>Kong Yuhen did not answer. Perhaps the wind answered on his behalf.</p><p>Water Ghost and Mei Siren looked at each other in shock.</p><p>It was unlikely that Bazhun’an would go crazy, but he had seen something that others could not.</p><p>What could it be?</p><p>However, no one wanted to ask. It was as if no one had ever had such a desire.</p><p>“Huang Quan had been here before?” Bazhun’an looked back.</p><p>“Why do you say that?” Water Ghost felt that Bazhun’an become very strange.</p><p>“That means there isn’t…” Bazhun’an pinched the vague traces of time around them with his fingertips and looked at Lei Xi’er. “Do you remember a scholar?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was slightly startled. She tucked her silver hair behind her ears, and her God Devil Eyes slowly swirled.</p><p>“Scholar…”</p><p>“Forget it.”</p><p>“What exactly are you trying to say!” Water Ghost felt that Bazhun’an was really acting so strangely.</p><p>“I can’t say.”</p><p>“If you don’t say it, how can we…”</p><p>“You won’t understand even if I tried to explain. You’ll forget it even if I do explain. How can I explain it?”</p><p>Water Ghost almost crushed his fist in frustration. He was also annoyed by Bazhun’an’s arrogance.</p><p>“If you don’t want to say it, then forget it.”</p><p>Bazhun’an looked toward the other side and saw Xu Xiaoshou. He sat by himself on a distant mountain and stared at the clouds in the sky.</p><p>The secondary plane door flipped open and he arrived at Xu Xiaoshou’s side. “You’re a clone? Sword Cognition Incarnation? Demi-saint Incarnation?”</p><p>“The second true body.”</p><p>“Oh, Xu Xiaoshou has accepted the legacy. Are you not affected?”</p><p>“We are semi-independent.”</p><p>“What is he experiencing now?”</p><p>“He’s enjoying the pain. He’s always been like this; he finds joy in suffering.” Bazhun’an looked toward the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>Everyone looked around. Xu Xiaoshou seemed to hug something tightly in his arms amid the Heavenly Ancestor Light.</p><p>“What were you staring at?” Bazhun’an sat down on a boulder and casually raised his head to look at the sky.</p><p>“Clouds.” “Clouds?”</p><p>“Elder Sang once said that the world is a cage, and there is a sky under the Goose Lake. As for what was above the sky… I’m thinking about it.”</p><p>“It’s me.”</p><p>“You?”</p><p>“No! It’s ‘me’, if you follow his theory.”</p><p>“Idealistic? Perhaps!”</p><p>The lonely second true body supported his chin and looked at the clouds in the sky. Suddenly, his lips twitched and he asked. “He asked me to ask you, where are we going next?”</p><p>“You guessed it.”</p><p>“Four Symbols Secret Realm?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“But I’ve already been exposed. The First Pavilion in the Sky, Young Master Xu, and even Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>“Stowaway.”</p><p>Bazhun’an also gazed at the clouds in the sky. Not long after, the two of them burst into laughter.</p><p>The billowing clouds scattered about in the sky.</p><p>Life is filled with constant changes.</p><p>“Why were you looking at the clouds?” Bazhun’an suddenly felt as if he had forgotten something.</p><p>“Loneliness.”</p><p>“Loneliness?” Bazhun’an was stunned for a moment, then he recalled something. “Do you remember a scholar?”</p><p>“Kong Yuhen. ”</p><p>“You remember?”</p><p>“Why are you surprised? Didn’t you just ask me to send him off?”</p><p>Bazhun’an suddenly stood up. He was stunned.</p><p>After a while, he pressed his abdomen and bent over with a smile. He looked at the people beside him, then at the white clouds and laughed again.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you’ve grown up.”</p><p>(End of Volume 3)</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
