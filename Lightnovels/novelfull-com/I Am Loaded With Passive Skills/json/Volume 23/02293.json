It would transform from Jin Ren into the form of the sickly young master Xu Gusheng.</p><p>Aunt Xiang turned around.</p><p>The second true body snapped his fingers. “Aunt Xiang, I am sincere. Although it’s only the minimum I could do, it’s a token of my sincerity.”</p><p>The sudden glow on his face disappeared.</p><p>Aunt Xiang looked up and saw that the hole in the roof had been repaired. The osmanthus wood started to regenerate. This was something that only a wood attribute Spiritual Cultivator could do.</p><p>With the activation of his spiritual senses, The Divine’s footprints disappeared from the corridor between the private room and the other room. The doors of the two rooms were also repaired.</p><p>The spiritual array in the room that had been destroyed by The Divine’s virtual image was also restored. The soundproof layer was automatically activated, and the quality had even improved.</p><p>Even the collapsed walls and the Yougui Pavilion’s damaged great array were restored to their original state.</p><p>The wood-type engineer and spiritual array architect on the first floor were stunned. They scratched their heads and looked at each other.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>She had forgotten that this kid was also a Divine Sorcerer, but he was also a wood-type Spiritual Cultivator? Aunt Xiang was surprised to see this Transformation and sat down.</p><p>“Xu Gusheng, I know you’re in a hurry, but…”</p><p>“No. This matter is very urgent! The Divine underestimated me and revealed too little just now. It was only a virtual image, and I can’t learn much from that.”</p><p>In the Apricot Realm, Xu Xiaoshou’s original body frowned and put away the Body Dao Disc under his feet.</p><p>Body, spirit, and mind discs were the three basic discs that he had already created.</p><p>However, even though he had entered the Unity of Man and the Heavens state, he couldn’t discern the changes in the power of his acupuncture points when The Divine cast the Transformation technique.</p><p>There were still traces of the Eight Doors to follow, and he could catch a glimpse of it.</p><p>He could not understand the Seven Constellations at all; it was as if he had been shut out.</p><p>As for the Six Paths… This was like a miracle. It could inexplicably borrow so much power. Xu Xiaoshou felt that the world had gone crazy.</p><p>The ancient martial arts were actually such magical techniques. With his passive skills, if he launched the Berserk Giant, then the Eight Doors, the Seven Constellations, and Six Paths…</p><p>F*ck!</p><p>With a mere virtual image, he could hit Saint Mountain with one punch.</p><p>If he could learn it well, he could fight a demi-saint or a Holy Emperor by himself. He could whisk Elder Sang out of the Dead Sea and even let him take refuge in the Spirit Palace, right?</p><p>Was this the ‘Godhood called a god at the gates of hell’?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally understood the meaning of ‘even The Divine is revered’ – it was only a wrong name, not a wrong nickname!</p><p>“I need to see Ghostface before the operation in the Four Symbols Secret Realm. That would be of great help to me.” The second true body said seriously.</p><p>“That’s easy.” Aunty Xiang poured herself a cup of tea and said absent-mindedly. “Ghostface had already requested an appointment with me. He said that he would visit me in a few days to apologize in person to you, Xu Gusheng.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>How could that rough man know about the ways of the world? That was great. The Ghost God gang suddenly became more appealing!</p><p>“The Divine underestimated me. I can master the Eight Doors and Seven Constellations in a month at most. I can go look for him after that.”</p><p>The second true body chuckled and sat down as he spoke.</p><p>When one only had one Master, one would have this strange mental obsession and feel that to be a master was something great.</p><p>But when there were multiple Masters… Such a serious illness could be cured without treatment.</p><p>His Master was his backer, so naturally, the more, the better!</p><p>Elixir Master, Swordsmanship Master, Ancient Martial Arts Master…There was nothing wrong with it!</p><p>There was no perfect person in the world. If he could have a Master who was multi-talented, it would not be a problem to worship him alone.</p><p>The problem was that there were none.</p><p>Then it wouldn’t be a problem for him to have a few more masters!</p><p>“Aunt Xiang, do you think I…”</p><p>The second true body was excited, but the original body in the Apricot Realm issued a reminder. He quickly restrained his joy and looked at Aunt Xiang seriously.</p><p>“Aunt Xiang, is there a problem? Tell me, and I might be able to help you solve it.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang pushed the teacup over with a frown.</p><p>She didn’t want to say it at first, but when she saw that the person who sat in front of her was actually Xu Xiaoshou, she thought that this person had some magical powers, so she told him her grievances.</p><p>“Aunt is indeed a little troubled.”</p><p>“How do you think Elder Dao the Flamboyant will respond to The Divine’s actions?”</p><p>“If he sends more people to the Cross Corner Street, or if he targets the Ghost God gang or even my Yougui Pavilion…”</p><p>The second true body laughed. “Don’t worry, Aunt Xiang. You may have interacted with Hallmaster Dao more than I have, but you don’t know him as well as I do.”</p><p>“Oh!” Aunt Xiang looked up at him and sneered. “You little brat, you’ve only met Elder Dao the Flamboyant once on Abyss Island, right? How dare you talk nonsense in front of me?”</p><p>No matter what, she, Xiang Yaoyao, was one of the Ten High Nobles. She had participated in the battle back then.</p><p>The feelings of the parties who were involved and outsiders differed greatly.</p><p>Not to mention that Xu Xiaoshou was a junior among juniors and only encountered Dao Qiongcang once.</p><p>The second true body smiled as well.</p><p>He laughed at Aunt Xiang’s concern.</p><p>This woman was indeed smart, but she clearly was not strong enough to make Dao Qiongcang view her as an opponent. Thus, she had never fought Dao Qiongcang head – on.</p><p>Otherwise, she would have known Dao Qiongcang’s weakness…</p><p>“Just as I expected, after The Divine’s punch, the Holy Divine Palace would not exert any more pressure on him in the City of the Dead Bodhisattva, not even here!”</p><p>The second true body pointed at his feet and said seriously, “Dao Qiongcang will temporarily shelve any plans for the Yougui Pavilion, the Ghost God gang, and even the entire faction from Changle Street that is related to us.”</p><p>“Why?” Aunt Xiang raised her eyebrows.</p><p>The second true body laughed. His replaced body even shuddered a little. He asked, “Aunt Xiang, do you know what smart people are most afraid of?”</p><p>“What are they most afraid of?”</p><p>“They are afraid of being reckless…” The original body in the Apricot Realm coughed, and the second true body hurriedly coughed as well. “They’re most afraid of people like The Divine!”</p><p>Who would want to fight such a reckless person?</p><p>Those with brains knew the consequences of being reckless, so they would be like Bazhun’an. He took control of Abyss Island and finally killed the Saint. The process was complicated, but the end result was gratifying.</p><p>One who was brainless would not consider the consequences at all!</p><p>If you provoked them, they dared to rush to your base camp in exchange for more.</p><p>Who could afford it?</p><p>In the current tense situation, Dao Qiongcang would definitely be in a state of panic after being attacked by The Divine’s virtual image.</p><p>The virtual image was already like this. What if his main body were to mess around at the Cross Corner Street…</p><p>Smart people were most afraid of this ‘what if’!</p><p>What if they touched a single hair on Aunt Xiang’s head and could not trap the beast at Cross Corner Street due to some unforeseen accident?</p><p>This vanguard dared to step on the Saint Mountain, and not only the Saint</p><p>Servants but all the dark factions of the five regions also dared to get involved.</p><p>After all, based on The Divine’s combat strength earlier…</p><p>He definitely had the ability to kill a higher-void Saint by himself! And this was deemed extremely ridiculous as it was just a virtual image!</p><p>Aunt Xiang was not stupid. She understood immediately and was no longer worried.</p><p>She looked over seriously and brought up the previous topic.</p><p>“Xu Gusheng, I won’t stop you if you want to learn ancient martial arts.</p><p>Ghostface will come to see you soon.”</p><p>“Aunt is aware that you’re very powerful… But even if it’s as you said, you can learn the Eight Doors and Seven Constellations in a month and then go to the Cross Croner Street and look for The Divine.</p><p>“Aunt only has one piece of advice!”</p><p>She said it so seriously that Xu Xiaoshou could not help but hold his breath and focus. “Aunt Xiang, please speak.”</p><p>“Don’t ever, ever provoke The Divine! Don’t even think about trying to fool him! Treat him as sincerely as Bazhun’an, and you will gain a lot.” Aunt Xiang spoke very earnestly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment before he nodded.</p><p>Aunt Xiang seemed to have thought of something terrifying. She shivered and said. “Xu Gusheng, you have to know that what you felt just now was not even one-ten-thousandth of The Divine. And the punch you saw at the end was not even one-thousandth of his strength.”</p><p>One in ten thousand, one in a thousand?</p><p>“Aunt Xiang is joking, right?” Xu Xiaoshou pursed his lips.</p><p>“I’m not joking.” Aunt Xiang shook her head. “You’ve met many demi-saints, right? You’ve even encountered Yan Wuse, the Divine Oracle and the Council of Ten.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Not enough, far from enough! Xu Gusheng, you have to know why some of them are so talented and some of them have lived for so long, but their reputation is far inferior to that of the Ten High Nobles.”</p><p>“The Divine has more tricks hidden away?</p><p>“Yes, I know him best.” Aunt Xiang hesitated for a moment before she said.</p><p>“With your current perspective, it’s very difficult for me to describe to you what the pinnacle of combat strength is.”</p><p>“It’s impossible to rely on imagination alone. Humans can’t transcend the limits of their horizons and gain more.”</p><p>“You have to see those people with your own eyes before you can understand this truth. Some people really bring despair to others when they were alive.” “Who were those people?” The second true body asked.</p><p>Aunt Xiang pursed her lips, and her peach blossom eyes became more solemn. She said in a serious tone.</p><p>“The young and frivolous Bazhun’an, The Divine outside the Bodhisattva City,</p><p>the meditative Kui Leihan…”</p><p>“As well as the bare chested Hallmaster Dao, whose traces you can no longer find….</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
