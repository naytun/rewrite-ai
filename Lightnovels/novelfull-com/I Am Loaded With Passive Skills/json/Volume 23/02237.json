How do you feel?”</p><p>“Nothing much… It expanded so much! Why is the energy of the Heavenly Ancestor’s Legacy so huge? I almost couldn’t stand up…”</p><p>“The Heavenly Ancestor is from the void giant race. From his size, you should know that his core power is very large. His energy reserve is incomparable.”</p><p>“That’s true… But why am I so weak after I received the legacy? I can’t even breathe… Phew!”</p><p>“You’re only at the Sovereign Dao Realm and you’ve received the ultimate legacy of the power of the ancestral source. It’s natural that the energy reserve could not contain it. In order to protect you, the excess power of the Heavenly Ancestor automatically overflowed and filled every part of your body… In other words, have you ever seen a Spiritual Cultivator before he self-destructed?”</p><p>“Uhh.”</p><p>“Yes, it’s similar to Number Two. At that time, its appearance was at its weakest, but the energy compressed and condensed in its body was also the peak of its life.”</p><p>“No, what I wanted to say was, could you come up with a better metaphor? Not uh Number…”</p><p>“You too! Now, it is equivalent to being in a self-destruct state all the time. Of course, it looked weak, but the energy inside was too strong. Therefore, when you go out for a walk later, be careful not to get your skin scratched by others. The consequences would be very explosive… Hmm, you don’t have to worry about that.”</p><p>“Wait, go out for a walk? I just want to find a place to digest the power of the</p><p>Heavenly Ancestor in peace…”</p><p>“There’s no time. Someone will be here. You have to meet him on my behalf.”</p><p>“Is this a mission?”</p><p>“No, this is a request. Is that alright, Lord Shou?”</p><p>“Central Region, Capital City, Changle Street, Yougui Pavilion. Look for a person called Aunt Xiang.”</p><p>“Wait, I haven’t agreed yet…”</p><p>“If you complete this mission, I’ll give you a person for your First Pavilion in the Sky.”</p><p>“Mission? You already said that we would discuss it in the future!”</p><p>“Aren’t we having a discussion right now? Don’t you think that the First</p><p>Pavilion in the Sky is short of people?”</p><p>“I want Li Fugui.”</p><p>“Who is that?”</p><p>“Southern Region, Half-Moon Residence, Flower Pavilion, an intelligence agent.”</p><p>“I don’t know him, but he’s considered a bonus. That’s being sincere already.</p><p>The one I’m talking about is a peerless genius.”</p><p>“Peerless genius? You Bazhun’an would still regard someone as a peerless genius? Are you kidding me… Who?” “You still have to invite this person yourself.”</p><p>“I quit! Who just said it was a gift?”</p><p>“If you can do that, he will be the sharpest sword in the First Pavilion in the</p><p>Sky. He will also be your thickest shield in the future, even thicker than the Shattered Shield.”</p><p>Even if Dao Qiongcang wanted to kill you, he would have to give him some face.</p><p>“You… Haha, Lord Baz, give me more details. Let’s have a good talk about this cooperation.”</p><p>“There’s no need to ask for so much information. Look for Aunt Xiang first. If you dare to mess around, I’ll create some problems. He’ll become the sharpest sword Dao Qiongcang will use against you.”</p><p>“Are you crazy?!”</p><p>“I’m slightly better than you.”</p><p>“Aunt Xiang… Who is that?”</p><p>“Don’t ask. You’ll know when you get there.”</p><p>“Then let me make some preparations first. Why does this name sound so familiar? I think I’ve heard it somewhere before.’</p><p>“There’s no need to prepare. We’ll set off immediately. We’ll meet tomorrow.</p><p>You woke up just in time.”</p><p>“You’re really crazy! My current appearance…”</p><p>“It’s perfect.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt very suspicious now. After he woke up on Abyss Island, Bazhun’an, this dirty rat had used the Holy Emperor Guidance.</p><p>It was just like how he had used the power of guidance of the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale to make everyone ignore the osmanthus carriage.</p><p>Bazhun’an made him ‘forget’ everything about Aunt Xiang.</p><p>Otherwise, with the powerful memory of his Perception, he would definitely recall something once he heard it, right?</p><p>He waited quietly in the private seat and thought hard, but nothing came to mind.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou decided to stop thinking about it. He turned his attention to the strange gazes and whispers of the people around him.</p><p>“Where did Xu Gusheng come from? He must have some important task to carry out, so he spent a lot of money to ask for an audience with Aunt Xiang.”</p><p>“Bullsh*t! I don’t think he’s asking for an audience. He’s purely a pervert… Look at his expression just now, he clearly really wanted to ‘book’ Aunt Xiang. Is this a newborn calf that is not afraid of tigers, or did he eat the guts of a bear or a leopard…”</p><p>“Heh, it’s probably another rich fool. I guess he was tricked by some scoundrel friend and was not aware of Aunt Xiang’s identity.”</p><p>“Tsk tsk, those are the Ten High Nobles!”</p><p>Ten High Nobles?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s hand trembled as he held the wine cup. The faint and subtle smile that he had learned to maintain on his face suddenly froze.</p><p>With a bang, his mind was hit by a bolt of lightning and the sealed memories were unlocked.</p><p>“Aunt Xiang, Xiang Yaoyao…”</p><p>“The one that was killed by Kong Yuhen, the pendant of a big Boss, and the soul that was captured by The Divine from the gates of hell…”</p><p>With a click, he placed the wine cup on the table. Xu Xiaoshou quickly waved the paper fan. He felt that the wine was a little too strong and his body started to heat up at this moment.</p><p>D*mn Bazhun’an…</p><p>Would it have killed you to tell me about it? Why did you do it? If I had known earlier, I would have kept a low profile…</p><p>If he found Aunt Xiang, then what about The Divine?</p><p>Why did he have to look for her? Was she related to the Saint Servant? Was she even one of the Saint Servant?</p><p>Bazhun’an only told him to look for this person and did not mention what the mission was. At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou could already relate to many things.</p><p>If Aunt Xiang and The Divine were also Saint Servants, even if they only were in contact and were friends…</p><p>At this point in time, a month after he beheaded Rao, everything would have fermented. The Holy Divine Palace would definitely be on the look out, right?</p><p>“I’ve always acted ostentatiously. Bazhun’an should have thought of it, but he didn’t warn me. This means that there shouldn’t be much of a problem with my actions. In fact, it’s even within his expectations….”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
