There are many things that you have to take note of here.”</p><p>“When you meet someone with a saber in the Eastern Region, you’ll definitely think that he’s either a Spiritual swordsman or an even more powerful ancient swordsman.”</p><p>“Here… It is not so!”</p><p>Old Man Li leaned forward as he drove the fragrant osmanthus carriage. As he spoke, the flesh on his cheeks puffed out, and he revealed a knowing smile. “That’s something of interest.”</p><p>“Oh?” A surprised voice came from inside the carriage. “Of interest? What sort of interest?”</p><p>“Young Master, stop pretending! ” Old Man Li couldn’t help but laugh.</p><p>“The high officials and nobles of Jade Capital City love to go to this kind of Exotic Pavilion.”</p><p>“Ordinary venues can’t satisfy them. They have to be outlandish. It’s best if they’re like you people from the Eastern Region, with a different kind of sword…”</p><p>“This is the kind that can truly ignite the fire in their hearts, hehe!”</p><p>Inside the carriage, the sickly Young Master Xu Xiaoshou frowned. He felt that Old Man Li’s tone was a little off.</p><p>But he didn’t think too much about it. He just found it funny.</p><p>Ever since the battle on Abyss Island ended, it had been more than 30 days since he received the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy.</p><p>By the time he woke up, not to mention Abyss Island, even the people who were on trial on the Yunlun Mountain Range, had all fled.</p><p>As soon as Xu Xiaoshou came out of seclusion, he accepted a mission from Bazhun’an. He managed to meet the deadline and came to the Central Region to meet a certain big shot on behalf of Old Eighth.</p><p>He set off yesterday and entered the capital today.</p><p>However, based on Old Man Li’s general information about the Central Region, he found out that when he arrived from the Eastern Region to the Central Region, even a mere sword was something exotic?</p><p>Exotic customs…This feeling was too wonderful!</p><p>In the Holy Sword Land, if you didn’t have a spiritual sword, you would be embarrassed to say that you were from the Eastern Region.</p><p>Even if the sword was not used and was only hung at the waist, it was still a symbol of nobility.</p><p>However, ever since they entered the Central Region, there was no need to mention the ancient swordsman.</p><p>On the streets, there were very few Spiritual swordsman, swordsman and even those with swords that hung on their waists.</p><p>Most of the people he encountered wore gold and jade that showed off their extravagant styles.</p><p>This was indeed fundamentally different from Bazhun’an’s group of lunatics from the Eastern Region who were obsessed with all manners of swords…</p><p>The people of the Central Region seemed to know how to enjoy life better?</p><p>Of course, this also indirectly proved that the Central Region had developed very well, and the Holy Divine Palace was very stable.</p><p>Otherwise, even Old Man Li wouldn’t dare to brag and even tease him about his newly fabricated identity as the descendant of the higher void.</p><p>“Exotic Pavilion, exotic scholar…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wondered if the person he was going to meet would be like Bazhun’an, who like to compose and recite poems.</p><p>He did have some foundation. After all, he had memorized a lot of the stuff.</p><p>But he felt that if he met a real scholar, he would be easily exposed. He would not be able to keep up the pretense!</p><p>“Old Man Li, how cultured are those scholars you mentioned?”</p><p>“Hehe, very cultured indeed!”</p><p>“How cultured is very cultured?”</p><p>“Young Master is still keeping up the pretense? Who would go to Yougui Pavilion if not to meet Miss Ah Yao?”</p><p>Miss Ah Yao, who the heck was she?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered over this and was about to ask when the carriage stopped. Old Man Li sighed and turned around. “Young Master, we have arrived at the Exotic Pavilion.”</p><p>Exotic Pavilion?</p><p>I’m going to the Yougui Pavilion, not the exo… Before he could say anything, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly froze in the carriage and subconsciously raised his hand to lift the golden bead curtain.</p><p>Green tiles, green eaves, red lights, the chatter of beautiful women.</p><p>The people who came and left were either rich or noble as ‘peaches’ and</p><p>‘apricots’ peeked through the door</p><p>Even though the sun was high up in the sky, this Exotic Pavilion with the plaque ‘Yougui Pavilion’ still had plenty of traffic.</p><p>Among the ‘peaches’ and ‘apricots’ at the door were two graceful women who wore rouge and heavy makeup. Their figures were curvaceous and they wore thin chiffon skirts in light spring colors. They each held a round fan and smiled as they waved at the passing people.</p><p>“Come in…”</p><p>“Young Master, do come in.”</p><p>“I heard that Miss Ah Yao will make an appearance tonight. This is a rare opportunity to get close to her!”</p><p>On the second floor of the attic, one could lean on the railings and enjoy their tea. There was a harp suspended over the railing and the harpist’s face was hidden by a piece of green gauze. The strings were gently stroked and her hollow back caused people to have fantasies. The passersby downstairs would stop and admire it as it left an endless aftertaste.</p><p>“Good song!”</p><p>“Heavenly music!”</p><p>“How can we hear such sweet sounds, yet we can’t see the person playing the harp?”</p><p>Then, with a wave of his sleeve, he initially pretended to be unwilling, then decided to follow his feelings; then he pretended to laugh as he entered the building at the speed of a meteor.</p><p>“Exotic… Pavilion…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>When had he ever seen such a grand scene?</p><p>He had left the Tiansang Spirit Palace and devoted himself to the Path of the</p><p>Sword, Elixirs and Killing. He had dealt with life and death and cultivated the Boulder Dao heart.</p><p>However, when he raised his head and lifted the curtain, he felt that the world had frozen and he reeled back in shock.</p><p>He had seen many beauties, such as Yu Zhiwen, Lei Xi’er, Rao Yaoyao, and so on. They were all peerless beauties.</p><p>However, it was the first time he had seen a beauty dressed in such a scanty outfit!</p><p>The clothes on her body added together were not even as thick as a sleeve after he activated the Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand.</p><p>This scene…</p><p>It was too overwhelming, he couldn’t grasp it at all!</p><p>Why would Bazhun’an agree to let me come to such a place? He’s crazy… Oh, he’s a married man. No wonder he didn’t dare to come… Xu Xiaoshou was suddenly enlightened.</p><p>The curtain of the carriage was lifted. Old Man Li winked and stuck his head out.</p><p>“Young Master, this is the Yougui Pavilion.”</p><p>“How is it, exotic enough?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly averted his gaze. His eyes were dizzy from the reflective snow-white flesh on show. His Adam’s apple bobbed up and down as he struggled to speak..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
