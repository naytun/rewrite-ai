Suddenly, he was curious about how strong The Divine was.</p><p>“Could it be that as long as the sign ‘Godhood called a god at the gates of hell’ is still there, then the Holy Divine Palace won’t even dare to look at Aunt Xiang?”</p><p>“Isn’t this a little outrageous? It’s like they paved the way for a ridiculous person… ”</p><p>Needless to say, Aunt Xiang seemed really arrogant!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t go upstairs even after he spent so much money.</p><p>After he drank three cups of wine, he quietly watched as more than ten beauties vied with each other to gain his favor. They tried to get close to him, and even Qiao’er and Yinying came over from outside and toasted him about seven or eight times.</p><p>This kind of experience was really amazing…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou remained calm, but he did not even catch a whiff of the elusive Aunt Xiang!</p><p>There were many people who came and went in the Yougui Pavilion and there was a lot of gossip to be heard.</p><p>As everyone chatted, the topics ranged from the sickly young master to other things.</p><p>Not long after, a commotion broke out in the courtyard on the right that attracted the attention of many people.</p><p>“Seven Sword Deity!”</p><p>“Have you heard? The new generation of Seven Sword Deity has been revealed!” This topic instantly caused a stir throughout the entire Yougui Pavilion.</p><p>Everyone swarmed over. Even the few beauties at the sickly young master’s table glanced sideways frequently.</p><p>They could not help it…</p><p>Seven Sword Deity, this name was too famous!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao, Hua Changdeng, Gou Wuyue… Which one of them wasn’t a dragon among men?</p><p>Even Bazhun’an, who wasn’t one of the Seven Sword Deity, had gained the title of the Eighth Sword Deity and was well-known in the Central Region.</p><p>“Young Master Zhou, your news is really reliable. Has the Seven Sword Deity really been re-ranked?”</p><p>“Naturally! Think about it. On Abyss Island, Master Siren and Fairy Rao underwent sanctification… How many deities were left among the Seven Sword</p><p>Deity after they underwent sanctification? This can’t be changed, right?” “Moonless Sword Deity, and the missing You Tu. Also Sword Deity Hua…”</p><p>“Tsk tsk, brother, your information is too outdated. I heard that almost all of the Seven Sword Deities had undergone sanctification. Fairy Rao was the latest one.”</p><p>“Ah, Moonless Sword Deity…”</p><p>“Hehe, the secrets of the heavens cannot be revealed. I do not wish to bring trouble to the clan. In short, a new era has arrived… Can everyone guess who the new Seven Sword Deity are?”</p><p>Everyone gritted their teeth.</p><p>Now, everyone just wanted to see the name list in Young Master Zhou’s hands as soon as possible. They were all impatient, but they could only endure it.</p><p>“I once heard that in the Eastern Region, the Saint Servant Lord Shou killed Rao</p><p>Yaoyao. He would definitely have a place among the new Seven Sword Deity!”</p><p>“Bullsh*t! Who is Xu Xiaoshou? Haven’t you heard that he relied on some external help? Everyone saw that if they had really fought, he wouldn’t even be able to block a single sword strike from me! I’m also a Swordsman!”</p><p>“I guess the Eldest Senior Brother of the Fringe Moon Immortal City, the leader of the new generation of the ancient swordsman in the Eastern Region, is definitely…”</p><p>“Bullsh*t! Are you talking about that Xiao Kongtong? Fringe Moon Immortal City is in dire straits now, who knows when it will be gone. It’s already good enough that he can survive past tomorrow, but can he even become a Seven Sword Deity?”</p><p>“The three brothers of the Gu family from the Burial Sword Tomb would definitely have three seats in the ranking…”</p><p>“Hahaha, the three Gu brothers? The Gu Qingyi who just held onto a famed sword and had no battle achievements and relied solely on bragging? Give me that sword, and I’ll fight too!”</p><p>“Hey, have you heard of the new Chief of the Transformation Division? He seemed to be an ancient swordsman as well…”</p><p>“What? It’s just an intelligence agency. They just spread the news and you took it seriously?”</p><p>“Brother, you’re too arrogant! I advise you to restrain yourself. There seems to be a brother from the Burial Sword Tomb here…</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not stand it anymore.</p><p>All he wanted was to get the name list of the Seven Sword Deity. Who was this, who merely barked like a dog here!</p><p>“And who are you?” The arrogant disciple was dressed in a sword robe and carried a black sword on his back. He gave him a sideway glance that was filled with disdain.</p><p>A Master Stage master… Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes darkened. He was too lazy to speak and brandished his paper fan.</p><p>“You are Xu Gusheng?”</p><p>“Xu Gusheng!” The man in the white robe with the black sword read it aloud in a low voice and laughed. “Where did this little brat come from? I’ve never even heard of Xu Gusheng!”</p><p>Young Master Zhou held the name list in his hand and took a step back.</p><p>The people beside him did the same. They stopped talking and made way for him. Each of them looked as if they were watching a good show.</p><p>On the contrary, the few beauties at the sickly young master’s table frowned slightly. They seemed to want to go forward, but they were pulled back by the sisters beside them.</p><p>“What’s your name?” Xu Xiaoshou waved his paper fan as if he didn’t notice. He smiled faintly.</p><p>“Feng! Xiao!”</p><p>The white-robed man with the black sword spoke in an arrogant manner as he thrust his chest out. The Sword Will around his body erupted in anger and made the tables and chairs of the Yougui Pavilion shake violently.</p><p>The surroundings fell silent.</p><p>“Way of the Sword Sovereign Stage…”</p><p>No one paid attention when the spiritual source of this Master Stage fluctuated.</p><p>However, when the Sword Will of a Sovereign Stage appeared, it meant that this person was also an ancient swordsman.</p><p>To be able to achieve so much by the age of 30 meant that his talent was naturally extraordinary. This Feng Xiao indeed had the capital to be arrogant..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
