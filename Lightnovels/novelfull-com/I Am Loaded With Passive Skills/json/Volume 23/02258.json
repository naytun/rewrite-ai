There was no follow-up.”</p><p>“He continued to track Sleeveless, but to no avail.”</p><p>At this point, Aunt Xiang glanced at the sickly young master opposite her and changed the topic.</p><p>“On He Ting mountain where the Five Evil Guys had dominated for many years, they finally suffered their first defeat.’</p><p>“Dui Hua Chuai Cha was defeated by an old man who was an unknown higher void. He was almost killed. This matter sent shockwaves throughout the</p><p>Central Region.”</p><p>“More people responded to the call to fight and rushed to He Ting Mountain. It was really a major occasion back then.”</p><p>“The battles continued, one after another. They fought for a few months. The remaining four of the Five Evil guys fought, and none of them lost.”</p><p>“Someone specially issued a challenge to Dui Hua Chuai Cha to meet in a battle. Logically speaking, even if he lost, he should be able to recover in a few days, let alone a few months.’</p><p>“There was no excuse for Dui Hua Chuai Cha not to take up this challenge. He accepted and in just a few days, he suffered another defeat due to extreme exhaustion.”</p><p>“The myth of this undefeated legend had finally been shattered. The heroes of the Central Region had risen up and challenged the five guys. Dui Hua Chuai</p><p>Cha never came out again.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou understood what she meant. He rapped the table and said, “It was not any random person who injured him. It was not a higher void who defeated him. It was Old Gou. Was that the sword wound he inflicted?”</p><p>“That’s right. The actual injuries left behind by the MO Sword Technique had affected Dui Hua Chuai Cha’s state. He would not recover within three to five years.”</p><p>“Unfortunately, he did not have that much time.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang sighed, and a mocking expression appeared on her face. She whispered.</p><p>“Ever since Old Gou’s battle with Sleeveless, he had laid low for quite some time already. He’s not as anxious anymore, and his pace had slowed down a lot.”</p><p>“He heard about the Five Evil Guys’ defeat. Maybe it was for the sake of the battle, or maybe it was just out of interest. I don’t know.”</p><p>“I think that after he heard the great name of He Ting Mountain for so many years, the tension in his heart finally eased. Perhaps Old Gou just wanted to relax a little, so he chose to pay his respects to the mountain one day.”</p><p>“Perhaps God decided to play a joke. When he went, the sun had just risen and the weather was beautiful. At the foot of the He Ting Mountain was the Mizao Spring and there was a man there who had an air of utter defeat about him. He had stopped at the spring to wash his feet.”</p><p>Mizao spring?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned slightly. It sounded familiar. Where had he heard it before?</p><p>However, that was not the main point. He continued to listen attentively.</p><p>“How sensitive was an ancient swordsman when it came to auras?”</p><p>“Even if this person had a different appearance and height, how could Old Gou not remember the person who attacked him with Sleeveless? He drew his sword instantly!”</p><p>“If he couldn’t be killed in a five-on-one fight, how could Old Gou lose in a one-on-one fight?”</p><p>“At the foot of He Ting Mountain, the spring was already stained with blood.”</p><p>“The battle lasted until noon. Qing Quan Zhuo Zu, one of the Five Evil Guys .</p><p>had fallen!”</p><p>Cause of death: Washing of his feet?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought this was a little funny even though it was tragic. Was this really not a joke from a rumor?</p><p>“Where were the others?” he asked.</p><p>“Laugh if you want to!”</p><p>Although she spoke about a sad event in the past, Aunt Xiang couldn’t help but laugh at this moment. She suppressed the strange smile on her lips and said.</p><p>“Old Gou should have chased after him with the Green River Sword Boardline. Qing Quan Zhuo Zu could not escape at all. It was even hard for him to send a message.”</p><p>“What he faced was an ancient swordsman at his peak… Old Gou! He was one of the Ten High Nobles! If you were caught, you would probably die on the spot!”</p><p>“And this domain nature of the Green River Sword Boardline had even shielded the fluctuations of the great battle until only a little was left.”</p><p>“As for the battle? When had there not been a battle on He Ting Mountain?</p><p>Everyone was used to it.”</p><p>“The Five Evil Guys may be crazy, but they were aware of each other’s strength. As long as Dui Hua Chuai Cha who was injured by the sword, didn’t run about or send a message, there was no need to go to his aid.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang shrugged.</p><p>So he died just like that?</p><p>There was a sense of logic in the absurdity, and a sense of humor in reality.</p><p>But overall, it was still too tragic. Just because he washed his feet?</p><p>“And then? Tell me! Tell me!”</p><p>“Your Master was often not at the Spirit Palace, was he?” Aunt Xiang suddenly asked.</p><p>“Yes…”</p><p>It suddenly dawned on Xu Xiaoshou after he said this.</p><p>No wonder Elder Sang was never really present at the Spirit Palace. It turned out that this guy would go to the Central Region to cause trouble whenever he was free?</p><p>He still remembered that when he first met Elder Sang, he had been in a hurry to participate in the Windcloud Competition. However, after he took some medicine, he became weak and almost missed the deadline.</p><p>The old man in the straw hat he met on the road, if he had missed the chance, it would cause him to have eternal regret!</p><p>Then, Elder Sang would only return to the Spirit Palace during the period when big events occurred?’</p><p>“But why bring this up?” Xu Xiaoshou asked, but he knew that when he met</p><p>Elder Sang, it was already sixteen or seventeen years after the current story.</p><p>Aunt Xiang sighed.</p><p>“Because at that time, Sleeveless went to the Eastern Region and was not at He Ting Mountain. This was also one of the direct reasons for the tragedy.”</p><p>“After Old Gou killed one of them, he didn’t alert the other three and left with the corpse.”</p><p>“Bei Shan Qi Lou, Dui Hua Chuai Cha and Song Xia He Dao who guarded the mountain felt that something was wrong. They sealed the mountain to search for him, but they couldn’t find Qing Quan Zhuo Zhu. They immediately informed Sleeveless.</p><p>“When Sleeveless returned from the Eastern Region, it was already half a day later.”</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou heard this this, he closed his eyes tightly. He felt that a bloody battle was right before his eyes.</p><p>It was only at this moment that he had a deep understanding of the space attributes and the strength of the ancient swordsman’s Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>Aunt Xiang held the wine glass in her hand and her eyes were filled with sorrow.</p><p>“The Ruler of the white-clothed people could have led all the forces that could be temporarily mobilized from the headquarters of the Holy Divine Palace of the Sacred Mountain Guizhe in the Central Region to wipe out He Ting Mountain.”</p><p>“This included the white-clothed people, the red-clothed people and the Holy Divine Guards. They could even borrow the Divine Puppet to mobilize the power of the six divisions..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
