After he finished speaking, his cold gaze swept all around.</p><p>The air froze in an instant.</p><p>“What I want to tell everyone is…”</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang can leave, and the next Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace could also be Zhong Yuanzi, Elder Yu, or Lord Nine Sacrifices… It doesn’t matter.”</p><p>“What’s important is that if all of you continue to fight against the Saint Servants in this state, you would end up like the Chiefs of the six divisions, Rao</p><p>Yaoyao, and Yan Wuse!”</p><p>“A tree, even if it’s one of the Nine Great Ancestral Trees, if it’s decayed from the inside, if it’s not healed as soon as possible and had to wait for someone to see and discover it, it meant that it’s already rotten to the core and there’s no cure! ”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng’s solemn voice was firm, and his fingers gently tapped on the armrest of the osmanthus wood wheelchair. The crisp tapping sound echoed across almost the entire peak of the Saint mountain. All the Saints on the steps had varied expressions.</p><p>Everyone felt uneasy.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng sneered, his voice became calm, but there was a bit of killing intent present.</p><p>“I know what everyone’s thoughts are…”</p><p>“I know that it is difficult to change a person’s nature, and it is even more difficult to change their bad nature.”</p><p>“Thus, I was the one who proposed this gathering at Gui Zhe. However, I didn’t ask you to come here to listen to a lecture or show your loyalty. I wanted you to come here to make a blood oath and set up a military order!”</p><p>Everyone below trembled and raised their heads. They heard the Saint Language as it reverberated like thunder in all directions of the Saint mountain.</p><p>“New blood enters the rotten roots, rotten diseases need medical attention.” “The Holy Divine Palace needs a good shake up.”</p><p>“We don’t have that much time to waste. The new Council of Ten and the new Chiefs of the six divisions will reorganize their internal affairs and come up with a brand new look as soon as possible. Then, we will fight against the Saint Servants.”</p><p>“You are all elites from all over the world. Those who don’t want to be encumbered can leave now. Those who stay will participate in the blood oath.</p><p>As for your Great Path blood oath, I will form a petition with it.”</p><p>“This petition is only to retain Palace Hallmaster Dao, who was so disappointed with you all. I wonder if everyone is in agreement?”</p><p>How would the people below dare to disagree?</p><p>“We will obey Lord Cangsheng’s orders!”</p><p>Everyone shouted, afraid that if they were half a second slower, the Eyes of the Great Path would land on them and the Evil Sin Bow would direct arrows at them.</p><p>At this moment, everyone realized…</p><p>The Holy Divine Palace was about to undergo a great change!</p><p>After the Demi-saint’s Mysterious decree and the blood oath were completed, Ai Cangsheng rolled up the scroll, turned and handed it to Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>“I wonder if Hallmaster Dao is in agreement?”</p><p>Everyone’s gaze swiveled toward him.</p><p>All the Saints on the jade steps seemed to be puzzled. Their expressions seemed to question Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>Did the two of you do all the important things secretly and did not even discuss it with us at all?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had a bitter expression.</p><p>Only he knew that he really wanted to abdicate. If no one stopped him today, he would really had gone away.</p><p>However, Ai Cangsheng dared to speak the truth. This was also true!</p><p>This guy not only saw the biggest pain point of the Holy Divine Palace, but also ripped open the scar in front of everyone.</p><p>Rectification…</p><p>It was easy to say, but if they really wanted to take action, how many forces would they offend?</p><p>You Ai Cangsheng would only deliver this speech, then turn around and retreat in your wheelchair. He would have to do everything after that, right?</p><p>“I don’t…” Dao Qiongcang shook his head.</p><p>“Let’s vote!” The Ninth Divine Priest suddenly interrupted him.</p><p>“I agree.” Elder Yu nodded.</p><p>“I agree.” Wei Fang raised his hand</p><p>“Alright.” Zhong Yuanzi heaved a sigh of relief. “It just so happened that the Council of Ten needed to discuss the matter first. Dao Qiongcang, your objection is invalid.”</p><p>“But I have the right to reject…”</p><p>“Then no, we’ll vote again.”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng said calmly, “Whenever you want to come back and resume the position of Hallmaster, you are always welcome. But before you leave, you still have some tasks to complete.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang took a deep breath and could not speak.</p><p>“Agreed.”</p><p>“Good decision.”</p><p>“This plan is too… Cough, Emperor Cangsheng summarized it well. To run away would be shameful, but to face up to it is to take responsibility.”</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p>Was this how the Council of Ten usually conducted their meetings? Wasn’t this a little too casual?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang glanced at the group of people around him. He ceased his protests and said, “I can indeed temporarily act as the Hallmaster until a new suitable candidate is appointed. However, there is a condition.”</p><p>“Alright.” Elder Yu replied subconsciously.</p><p>“Agreed.” Wei Feng nodded habitually.</p><p>“Sure… Uh, no, tell me first.” Zhong Yuanzi realized that they were in public.</p><p>“Yes, let him state it first…” The Ninth Divine Priest’s beautiful eyes looked at the two, as if she reproached them for their brainless nods. “Then we will agree.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang started to speak.</p><p>Some words were at the tip of his tongue, but he felt that they were really unpleasant so he swallowed them. In the end, he only said.</p><p>“I will establish the ‘Heavenly Group’. I will be responsible for the coordination of all the actions against the Saint Servant. I will give the orders and they cannot be refuted, even if they were directed at you.”</p><p>“No problem.” Ai Cangsheng said with a slight smirk.</p><p>The Saints around him were stunned for a moment and nodded immediately.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>“Excellent!”</p><p>“That’s not a problem. It’s a good thing!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang took a deep breath.</p><p>All the Saints were still stunned, but they seemed to have realized something.</p><p>Then, they shouted in unison, “Yes!”</p><p>A vast amount of Holy Power swept across the Saint Mountain.</p><p>The people below felt that their souls had been cleansed and they were filled with respect, but they seemed to have forgotten something.</p><p>When they looked up at the jade steps again, the Saints held their heads high and thrust their chests out. Their blood oaths had just been completed, and each of them had a murderous aura. This was not child’s play at all. Ai Cangsheng’s lips twitched slightly as he said softly, “Fight..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
