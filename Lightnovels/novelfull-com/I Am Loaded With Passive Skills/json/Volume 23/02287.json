She snuggled into the man’s arms and gently rubbed her face against the idiot’s broad chest like a frightened kitten. ‘Ugh!</p><p>The innocent boy, Xu Xiaoshou, had the same reaction as his second true body. How could he stand such a disgusting scene? He almost vomited out the foot washing water and the food he ate last night.</p><p>When did Kong Yuhen hurt you?</p><p>That was clearly caused by your own fingernails!</p><p>With your cultivation level, if you were to scrape off the blood from such a small wound, your injury would probably have healed long ago!</p><p>However, The Divine couldn’t see all this. He only looked up and glared at the sky. Then, he realized that the person had already disappeared. He lowered his head and patted the head of the person in his arms. He said calmly.</p><p>“The next time he appears, call me immediately. Do not delay. He has the Spatial Upanishad.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“I can’t stay out for too long. The Eyes of the Great Path will see me. I have to go back.”</p><p>“Oh. ”</p><p>“Don’t throw a tantrum. Be good.”</p><p>“Alright, then you can go back. I will be all alone again…” Aunty Xiang raised her head and had an aggrieved look in her eyes.</p><p>“It’s all that dog Ail s fault for keeping an eye on me all the time!” The Divine felt helpless. His eyes suddenly turned cold. “But before we go back, there’s another peeping dog that needs to be dealt with.”</p><p>“+(Startled, Passive Points,+)+l.”</p><p>Separated by the Apricot Realm, Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils constricted. He thought to himself, “Not good. This dog actually wants to attack me?”</p><p>How did the second true body react?</p><p>“Dispel…”</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>However, before he could even gather his thoughts, the two doors exploded instantly.</p><p>The human-shaped beast that was so tall that it needed to bend down in order to enter had left a set of footprints on the corridor and rushed to the opposite side.</p><p>He reached out with one hand and grabbed the second true body’s neck. He lifted it off the ground easily as if he lifted a chick.</p><p>The murderous Force in his eyes was like the giant he had seen in the Swallow the Mountains and Rivers fantasy realm. It turned into a terrifying pressure that crushed the thoughts in the second true body’s mind.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>“I am not the enemy!”</p><p>The second true body was in pain. As he explained, he felt as if his neck was about to break. He could not help but reach out and slash down with all his might as he wanted to remove the huge arm that held his neck.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou swore that this was the first reaction that both he and his second true body had.</p><p>He only wanted to protect himself and had no intention to cut off this arm.</p><p>The Divine’s eyes narrowed. He sensed that the enemy wanted to resist, and he released his right hand.</p><p>The second true body’s hands cut through the air.</p><p>F*ck!</p><p>Such a reaction…</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Before he could stop his thoughts, a huge force came from his chest.</p><p>The Divine’s left palm was actually stuck at the moment of interruption, and the second true body was sent flying.</p><p>Just as the second true body was about to fly backward, his right palm reached out again and grabbed the second true body’s neck.</p><p>“Kite…”</p><p>Within the Dragon Apricot, Xu Xiaoshou sucked in a breath of cold air. He felt that his second true body was like a paper kite being played by The Divine.</p><p>The lower half of his body swung back due to the force of the palm, but his neck was grabbed tightly. He couldn’t even fly backward. As a result, he almost spun in the air and his neck broke.</p><p>“Stop, idiot!”</p><p>Only then did Aunt Xiang’s panicked voice rushed over.</p><p>The power in The Divine’s palm eased a little, and his second true body seized this opportunity to use the Vanishing Technique. He disappeared in an instant.</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>The blood that spilled onto the ground could not disappear because it had separated from the main body.</p><p>The Divine turned sideways and did not touch it at all.</p><p>In a flash, the battle ended.</p><p>In comparison, Aunt Xiang, whose reaction speed was almost negative, only saw The Divine’s empty right palm and the bloodstains on the ground.</p><p>The scene looked like Xu Xiaoshou had been crushed by someone and did not even leave any residue behind.</p><p>Moreover, it was normal for such things to happen when it came to The Divine…</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>Her mind went blank. Aunt Xiang’s delicate body swayed and she staggered slightly. Her face was drained of all color as she stuttered.</p><p>“You, you killed him?”</p><p>What kind of escape technique was this… a trace of curiosity flashed in The Divine’s eyes, but he did not respond immediately. He was quite interested in this kind of escape technique that could allow the other party to disappear as long as he relaxed his grip.</p><p>This was the first time he had seen his enemy escape from his control, even if he was in the form of a virtual image that did not even have one-ten-thousandth of his strength.</p><p>“How could you kill him?”</p><p>“You idiot! Can’t you ask me before you kill someone? You’re in big trouble!”</p><p>Aunt Xiang walked over and looked as if she had lost her soul. She almost reached out to slap this fool, but she couldn’t bear to do so.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Who is he?” The Divine turned around and figured that this kid should be considered a top figure in the outside world, based on this escape technique.</p><p>“He…” Aunt Xiang was so angry that her chest trembled violently. However, the walls had ears, so she did not directly name him. “You can kill anyone, but you can’t kill him!”</p><p>She stretched out her hand.</p><p>The Divine smiled as he looked at the anxious Xiang’er, who held his hand and tried to write on it.</p><p>After she repeatedly wrote three times on it, he finally realized who this person was. He smiled and said, “But I didn’t kill him.”</p><p>“Ah?” Aunt Xiang looked at the bloodstains on the ground.</p><p>“Since it’s him, how was it possible that he could not block my virtual image’s palm strike? Did you overly underestimate him…”</p><p>Aunt Xiang glared at him.</p><p>The Divine immediately shut his mouth and did not state the name.</p><p>“Xu Gusheng?” Aunt Xiang looked around.</p><p>In its disappearing state, the second true body was really scared!</p><p>From his Perception, he could clearly see that his neck, that had been strengthened by the Holy Emperor Lv.0, had five distinct red marks. His bones were broken, and it was difficult for him to breathe.</p><p>Moreover, after The Divine’s palm strike on his chest, all his meridians were shattered, his internal organs were ruptured, and even his energy reserve had exploded. He could not use it at all.</p><p>The external injuries were not serious.</p><p>The second true body felt that the internal injuries almost caused an instantaneous death!</p><p>The reason why The Divine didn’t kill him in the end was probably because he heard Aunt Xiang’s belated ‘stop’, so he had held back his strength.</p><p>“This is the top combat strength of the Ten High Nobles?”</p><p>He had seen the extremely weak Bazhun’an, encountered Dao Qiongcang who was not good at fighting and experienced the head shot from Gou Wuyue who had retreated instead of advancing after he was injured by Elder Sang; he even had a drink with the polite Kong Yuhen who was a theoretical person…</p><p>For the first time, Xu Xiaoshou came into direct contact with a top-notch combatant from the previous era, and it was a one-sided fight.</p><p>He had never thought that with his battle consciousness that was close to the third realm, he could even deal with the Divine Oracle. When he faced this bald guy, he was as weak as a chicken!</p><p>What was more important was that this guy was only a virtual image. How terrifying would he be in person?</p><p>“This is the existence that required the third emperor Ai Cangsheng to set aside all his affairs and use the Eye of the Great Path to watch over him all the time, for decades?”</p><p>When he thought of the murderous aura in The Divine’s eyes that could only had been honed after a fight to the death…</p><p>That fighting technique and battle consciousness that allowed him to react vividly when he got close…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was numb. He felt that even with the Vanishing Technique, he was not very safe against such an opponent.</p><p>He had just digested the lingering fear of his disappearance from this world. He was about to leave when he realized this.</p><p>In the room, after The Divine comforted his frightened Xiang’er, he suddenly shouted.</p><p>With a boom, the space in all four directions was severed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart sank. It felt extremely familiar. His second true body had been exiled!</p><p>“+(Startled, Passive Points,+)+l.”</p><p>The Divine put his palms together, and the surrounding space cracked, but it didn’t shatter, because the Yougui Pavilion no longer existed.</p><p>However, the speed at which the space collapsed was too fast.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the lines spread toward a boundary.</p><p>The surroundings were shattered, and the complete space with the human-shaped outline could naturally be seen.</p><p>Out of place!</p><p>The thing that Xu Xiaoshou was most worried about had finally happened.</p><p>He had been found by someone who used the banishment technique while he was in his disappearing state. Moreover, it had happened in an instant and he did not have the time or chance to react.</p><p>The Divine smiled and stared at the person he couldn’t see or touch with interest.</p><p>“Little brat, come out!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
