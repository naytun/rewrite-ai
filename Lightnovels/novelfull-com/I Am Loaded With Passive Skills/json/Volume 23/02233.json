It’s beef sauce, it’s heavenly sauce beef!” “Those who have money, support me, and those who don’t will just be a spectator. Look at my flames!”</p><p>“Mother, look! It’s a fire-type Spiritual Cultivator!”</p><p>“Silly child, you’re always out playing instead of cultivating properly. You’ll have to perform like this in the future to make a living.”</p><p>“Carriage, what a beautiful carriage!”</p><p>“Shh, don’t point at him. Do you see that symbol? It’s a fragrant osmanthus carriage that only the descendant of a higher void is qualified to ride in.”</p><p>“Tsk tsk, Old Zhang, look, they’re really rich! Recently, there had been no peace in the capital. Many noble young masters and young ladies have entered the city.”</p><p>“Clack clack…”</p><p>The fragrant osmanthus carriage drove through the long streets of the ancient capital. The streets bustled with shouts and cries from vendors and the scent of osmanthus was mixed with the aromas of various kinds of food that made one’s stomach churn.</p><p>The curtain inlaid with gold beads was lifted, and a fair delicate hand stretched out. The ten fingers were long and slender, and the knuckles were distinct and looked as if they belonged to a woman.</p><p>However, through the side window of the carriage, one could see that under the dim light, there was an extraordinarily handsome and fair face. It looked sickly as if the young master within had never ventured into the sunlight.</p><p>He covered his mouth and coughed lightly. He turned his head back and seemed to listen to something carefully.</p><p>However, the capital’s great array had completely blocked out any movement from the outside world. Everyone had long gotten used to it and did not think too much of the tremor that occurred.</p><p>When one sat in the carriage, one could see the rear and it would be rather unbecoming to poke one’s head out. As such, the young master of a noble family naturally could not do such a thing.</p><p>Soon, the sickly young master in the carriage let down the golden bead curtain. He was done with his task.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, this is the capital.” The coachman was an old man. He noticed the movement behind him and smiled as he told him.</p><p>“Isn’t Jade Capital City written on the plaque?”</p><p>A weak voice came from inside the carriage. The voice was extremely pleasant to the ear, but it was accompanied by a light cough. It should be a serious illness. Everyone who looked at him from the side of the road had this thought.</p><p>“Young Master, you came from the Eastern Region to the Holy Palace to study, so of course you are unaware. Jade Capital City is an ancient name inherited from the mortal world. It was the name given by the previous Hallmaster after this city evolved into the number one city of the Spiritual Cultivation World.”</p><p>“I see… Ahem.”</p><p>Only then did the people who were on the side of the road realize that this sickly young master was from the Eastern Region.</p><p>If he had come all the way to the Holy Palace to study, he should have obtained a spot and wanted to participate in the Holy Palace trial.</p><p>Indeed, one should not judge a book by its cover.</p><p>Such a sickly young master was actually able to obtain a spot to enter the Holy Palace Trial. How did he obtain it? By coughing?</p><p>There were many swordsmen in the Eastern Region. Could this young master be a swordsman or an ancient swordsman?</p><p>The crowd watched and wondered as the fragrant osmanthus carriage rolled through the city. The sickly young master entered the city, but they did not get any answers.</p><p>“I heard that this City Guarding Array was created by Hallmaster Dao?” “That’s right. Rumor had it that even a demi-saint can’t break through it.”</p><p>“I don’t believe this. You, a layman, don’t know what a Demi-saint’s Power is like, nor do you know that you can’t insult a Saint. What a joke… cough cough… By the way, where is the Saint mountain?”</p><p>“In the air.”</p><p>Old Man Li pointed at the distant sky.</p><p>The sickly young master lifted the curtains of the carriage and looked into the distance.</p><p>The mountain hung upside down under the floating clouds. The golden osmanthus on the top of the mountain were dyed red by the sun. There were no traces of any Saint and the fragrance spread across thousands of miles.</p><p>“So close…” The sickly young master muttered to himself.</p><p>Old Man Li heard this and smiled. “Look at the mountain; it may look near but is actually quite far away. Even if you want to get to the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe from here, you would have to fly for three to five years.” “I can reach the Heavens in one step…”</p><p>“Then Young Master is amazing!” Old Man Li was amused. “It’s rumored that there’s a Sword Deity with the surname Hua…”</p><p>“On the mountain.”</p><p>“There’s an Emperor who loves the common people…”</p><p>“On the mountain.”</p><p>“There’s a Hallmaster who has divine foresight…”</p><p>“He is also on the mountain and is protecting us.”</p><p>The fragrant osmanthus carriage moved forward. The Saint mountain, that seemed to hang upside down from the sky was lost among the clouds that hovered above the mountain side. Even the snow-white peak that was dyed orange by the morning sun, seemed to move forward bit by bit.</p><p>“Really, it’s so close, old man.”</p><p>The sickly young master muttered absentmindedly once again. This time, his pale face was flushed red. “I heard that there’s also a Dead Sea…”</p><p>“They’re all in the mountains… Uh, what is the Dead Sea?” Old Man Li was puzzled this time.</p><p>“Yes…”</p><p>The sickly young master’s voice suddenly stopped and he looked back at the Information Bar in his mind.</p><p>“+(Watched, Passive Points +)+263.” “+(Admired, Passive Points+) +184.” “+(Chased, Passive Points,+)+l.” Chased?</p><p>That woman is here for me?</p><p>“Let’s go!” He let down the gold-beaded curtains of the carriage and said calmly, “Go to the Yougui Pavilion on Changle Street. Hurry.”</p><p>“Hehe, alright, Young Master.” The smile on Old Man Li’s face became subtle. He suddenly flicked the reins in his hand and exerted some strength from his waist.</p><p>“Giddyup!’</p><p>The carriage sped across the street, and pedestrians quickly got out of the way. This time, no one turned their heads and paid any attention, as if this behemoth did not exist on the street.</p><p>The billowing smoke and dust were accompanied by gusts of strong wind and made many customers curse the weather.</p><p>In the hustle and bustle, after the uproar died down.</p><p>Li Fuyu stood amid the bustling Jade Capital City. She listened to the noisy shouts and looked at the endless stream of people that came and went. It was like a man from the mountains who had entered the mortal world and lost his way.</p><p>“Explosive content! ”</p><p>“Shocking news!”</p><p>A child with a long braid stumbled past her waist. She didn’t manage to catch him, but he wasn’t put out and continued his journey. He brandished the jade scroll in his hand and shouted.</p><p>“The latest information from the Southern Region. Only sold for one Spirit Crystal. It’s fair and honest. It’s definitely accurate!”</p><p>“The new generation of the Seven Sword Deity had just been released!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
