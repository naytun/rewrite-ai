This is the first time I’ve been to the Saint mountain and the first time I’ve seen… Hmm, why are there only six figures?”</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao! The leader must be Hallmaster Dao. He’s really sage-like and has amazing talent and looks!”</p><p>“Emperor Cangsheng is here too. Is that the Evil Sin Bow?”</p><p>“There’s also Wei Feng, the God of Killing… Hiss, I haven’t seen this person for a long time.”</p><p>“Lord Nine Sacrifices is so beautiful!”</p><p>“Kun Peng God Elder Yu! There is also the Elemental Divine Envoy, Lord Zhong</p><p>Yuanzi! It’s been a long while since we saw him…”</p><p>“Where are the others?”</p><p>After the six figures landed on the Six Paths, one after another, they all eagerly awaited the arrival of the other four people.</p><p>With regards to Rao Yaoyao, when they heard that she had been beheaded by Lord Shou who was a new generation Saint Servant in the Yunlun Mountain Range, they still did not believe it.</p><p>These rumors would only be confirmed when the Saint Mountain officially published her obituary.</p><p>“Everyone! ”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was dressed in black and white and had a solemn look. He held the divine Sinan in his hand. As soon as he spoke, the osmanthus flowers in the vicinity of the Saint Mountain withered, and everyone’s smiles disappeared.</p><p>There was a trace of sorrow in the air.</p><p>Everyone’s hearts sank, and they no longer dared to smile. They realized that this grand meeting was probably not about the appointment of a new official. Its main keynote would be something mournful?</p><p>The fragrance of the osmanthus wafted over the eastern side of the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe and drifted into the Land of Screen and Candles.</p><p>Under a withered willow tree was an ancient table that had gathered dust for many years, a shattered lamp, and a pitted ghost sword.</p><p>The flickering candlelight showed a blurry figure that was no longer paralyzed under the withered willow as he slowly got up.</p><p>He was like one of the Elders, his movements were excruciatingly slow but he finally managed to push himself up. He leaned against the withered willow.</p><p>Hua Changdeng slowly turned his head and his face was expressionless as he looked toward the Saint Hall.</p><p>Throughout the entire process, he did not make a sound.</p><p>The ghost sword that laid on the ancient table, trembled slightly and a faint cry like that of a sparrow came from it. It was as if it celebrated something.</p><p>Hua Changdeng didn’t care. He noticed something after he turned around. His lips curved up slightly. Then he raised his hand slowly and touched it gently.</p><p>“How many years had it been…”</p><p>The God Worship Willow Tree finally sprouted new leaves of green.</p><p>“This is a letter of apology.”</p><p>“I, Dao Qiongcang, sincerely apologize and it is with the utmost sorrow that I have to make this announcement to everyone here.”</p><p>“In the battle between Sky City and the Saint Servant, the result was not that both sides suffered severe losses as what the rumors stated. The truth was that our Holy Divine Palace lost everything!”</p><p>“We paid a heavy price for this.”</p><p>“The Chiefs of the six divisions, Yi, Ye Xiao, and Teng Shanhai were sacrificed.</p><p>Situ Yongren, the acting Chief of the Path Division, was killed in the array. Yu Lingdi, the Chief of the Spirit Division is missing. There had been no news of him.”</p><p>“In the Council of Ten, the Third Emperor, Yan Wuse, the Divine Oracle, Number Two and the Ruler of the red-clothed people, Rao Yaoyao, all of them suffered the Saint Fall.</p><p>“In addition, the red and white clothed people and Holy Divine Guards were mobilized from various locations and dispatched to Dongtianwang City in the Eastern Region and the Yunlun Mountain Range to carry out their mission. We have lost more than a thousand lives and suffered more than ten thousand casualties.”</p><p>“Because of the counterattack of the dark faction in the first battle, countless comrades who guarded the five domains of the continent had died!”</p><p>“Among them, there were young talents, mature elders, people who were ready for battle, people who were about to retire, some who were alone, some who had families, some who had lovers waiting, some who were their parents’ hopes…”</p><p>“It was all because of me!”</p><p>“Due to me, Dao Qiongcang’s dereliction of duty, they all died.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang closed his eyes and bowed slowly.</p><p>“I’m sorry…”</p><p>The whole of Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe was completely silent.</p><p>Everyone felt as if they had been struck by lightning. They simply could not believe the contents of this apology speech – all of it!</p><p>Although they were elites, they were only in the middle and upper echelons. They only guarded certain places and lived in certain corners.</p><p>They heard a lot of gossip, but they were all different versions.</p><p>The Chief of the Path Division’s Transformation Division was gone, and the Spirit Division Chief of the Dark Division was gone…</p><p>Within the six divisions, there were also various rumors. Some said that Rao Yaoyao was gone, while others said that Yan Wuse was gone…</p><p>As the news spread, no one believed it.</p><p>Who would have thought that after they climbed the mountain, Hallmaster Dao’s opening speech confirmed that they were all gone!</p><p>At a certain moment, the atmosphere on the Sacred Mountain Gu Zhe was extremely oppressive. It seemed to be on the verge of a massive explosion.</p><p>However, under the gaze of the Saints on the high jade steps, there was no commotion.</p><p>Everyone finally understood.</p><p>During the war, all this information was suppressed so as not to undermine the morale of the army.</p><p>If this information had been released at that time, they would probably have died without even a fight.</p><p>But…</p><p>How could that be?</p><p>This ridiculous death rate had simply rocked the history of the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe!</p><p>Everyone’s emotions fluctuated wildly. Finally, all the low pitched discussions ended. Everyone’s eyes were directed toward Hallmaster Dao who stood on the jade steps as they eagerly waited for an explanation. After Dao Qiongcang bowed, he stood up and sighed.</p><p>“We underestimated our opponents.”</p><p>“We thought they were just street rats that we could easily thrash.”</p><p>“But this time, it’s different. It’s fundamentally different.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang took a deep breath.</p><p>“In the Central Region, they were the Fen Qin from sixteen years ago. They were the blood leeches that took root under the Saint Mountain. They were the kings of the underground world. Fortunately, they were eliminated by the white-clothed people.”</p><p>“However, the remaining tumors didn’t die after they were removed. They infiltrated the major factions and stayed hidden. They created another</p><p>‘teahouse’. Fortunately, the teahouse was also removed by the white-clothed people a few years ago..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
