It was a spectacular sight.</p><p>“Hurry up! Hurry up!”</p><p>“I heard that there will be a big event happening today. It’s been a long time since I’ve seen so much action on the Saint Mountain.”</p><p>“Speaking of which, what happened? I was summoned back from the Southern Region…”</p><p>“Senior of the red-clothed people? You have guarded the extradimensional space all year round, so it’s normal that you don’t know. I heard that there would be a major change among the people above.”</p><p>“Oh? How big a change?”</p><p>“It’s almost equivalent to a reshuffle!”</p><p>“No, no, no. Senior of the red-clothed people, don’t listen to his nonsense. The version I heard was that Hallmaster Dao was going to resign and there would be a new Hallmaster!”</p><p>“Hiss! Such a big matter? Are you sure?”</p><p>“Why else would there be so many people gathered here to be the witnesses today? How many years had it been since the Saint Mountain had such a grand event? Those who could come this time are not ordinary people.”</p><p>“It seems that the six divisions would also be replaced. Our Chief died… He had been missing for a long time already. Many operations could not be carried out normally. This time, we’ll definitely have to officially appoint a new Chief of the department.”</p><p>“Heh, you guys are lucky to be able to get a new appointment. Our Spirit Division Chief fought on Abyss Island and I heard that he didn’t die. However, because of his father, he hasn’t returned yet. He became the laughing stock of the entire Saint Mountain.”</p><p>“Hahaha, Yu Lingdi is indeed a joke. I wonder if the future development of the Spirit Division would be affected. Not only was the Great Demon King Xu alive, but he also joined the Saint Servant. I never expected this.”</p><p>“Hey, have you heard? After the battle in Sky City, there was only one survivor among the six Chiefs of the six divisions, Wang Dachui! Someone said that he got wind of it in advance and didn’t participate, that was how his life was spared.”</p><p>“No way, why did I hear that he was lucky and was in charge of the matters outside the Yunlun Mountain Range, so he wasn’t swept into the Lone Cliff?” “Shh, the survivors are climbing the mountain over there. You’re too loud…”</p><p>Amidst the noisy discussions, a short hunchbacked old man, Wang Dachui, silently climbed the mountain.</p><p>Originally, he liked to joke around and had a lively personality. He would often quarrel with Teng Shanhai when he had nothing to do.</p><p>However, this reticence had already been part of Wang Dachui for more than a month.</p><p>Others might not be sure, but as the Chief of the six divisions, the information he received was that his former companions were all gone.</p><p>There were no exceptions!</p><p>Yi, Teng Shanhai, and Ye Xiao had all died in battle…</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s disappearance…</p><p>Situ Yongren died.</p><p>This was only the six divisions and did not include the elite demi-Saints from the Holy Divine Palace who had fallen in the battle.</p><p>His comrades who were outside the frontline could still joke around as they climbed up the mountain, but Wang Dachui could no longer laugh.</p><p>These loss of lives were nothing. They were just a few people. To the Saint Mountain, they meant nothing.</p><p>But Wang Dachui knew that this was the most serious loss that the Holy Divine Palace had suffered in recent decades.</p><p>Even he could see that this shake up of the elites was definitely not the norm.</p><p>It was Dao Qiongcang who made preparations for the upcoming battle. He was the first son of this life and death situation.</p><p>A storm was imminent!</p><p>One could imagine how dangerous it would be next.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>He leaped onto the peak of the Saint Mountain with his sledgehammer strapped on his back.</p><p>As he swept his eyes around, he saw that the white-clothed and red-clothed people and the six divisions tribes had already gathered. They were all assembled in an orderly manner as they chatted away.</p><p>Everyone present was a top-notch person, each with their own prestige.</p><p>The Council of Ten did not make an appearance, but they continued to provide guidance with their empty talk. From the Ten High Nobles to the new Seven Sword Deity, they commented on everything. How happy was that!</p><p>Wang Dachui looked away and tried to keep out of sight.</p><p>He recalled the scene when he first entered Dongtianwang City that night.</p><p>When the transmission channel opened, Ye Xiao, Yi, Teng Shanhai, Situ Yongren, and Rao Yaoyao came out. They were all in high spirits.</p><p>The Seven Sword Deity were led by the Chief of the six divisions to support the war in the Eastern Region. Who there did not have the thought that it would only be fun and then they would head off home?</p><p>Now, they were all dead!</p><p>If he hadn’t accepted Rao Yaoyao’s mission on the Lone Cliff and turned around to search for Huang Quan, he too would have died.</p><p>Perhaps today, he would become one of the main characters in their discussion.</p><p>“Go ahead and laugh…”</p><p>Wang Dachui didn’t care about the ridicule of the survivors around him.</p><p>He already knew how powerful his opponent was, but these people were still in the dark and had yet to wake up.</p><p>Today, they could still laugh. Tomorrow, when they went to the front line, he hoped they would still be happy and at ease.</p><p>“Chief?”</p><p>“Greetings, Chief!”</p><p>“Greetings, Chief!”</p><p>Only the team that belonged to the Physique Division saw their chief and saluted him respectfully. They welcomed the only Chief of the six divisions who had shown up in advance.</p><p>The surrounding discussions quietened a little, but not too much.</p><p>The remaining members of the five divisions who had lost their respective Chiefs were like a group of dragons without a leader. Their vigor and spirits were scattered like loose sand.</p><p>However, their eyes still shone.</p><p>However, the light was not directed at the sky. It was only directed toward the identity of the new Chief.</p><p>Someone laughed and said, “I can go up too.” He wondered if he would be lucky enough to be selected as the Chief of the division later.</p><p>Some of them even started to plan their activity after the Saint Mountain feast and reminisced about the taste of the Central Region beauties they had not seen for a long time.</p><p>The warm wind made people drunk, and the fragrance of the osmanthus penetrated one’s senses.</p><p>The imperial capital still prospered and elegant officials valued red lips.</p><p>Wang Dachui used to be one of them. This time, after he swept his gaze around, he silently looked away and instead looked at the majestic Saint Hall located on the jade steps..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
