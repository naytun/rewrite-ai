The backyard is in this direction, right?”</p><p>The sickly young master took her hand and seized Qiao’er with the other. Under the dumbfounded gazes of the crowd, he walked away with the two ladies.</p><p>It was all very natural.</p><p>One breath, two breaths, three breaths…</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Old Ghostface finally came back to his senses.</p><p>“+(Retained, Passive Points)+l.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stopped but he did not turn around. He raised his folding fan and</p><p>waved it as he drawled.</p><p>“I’m not afraid of you, I know that your boss isn’t around and I can’t be bothered to bully you.”</p><p>“If you stop me again, my guard would not be so polite.”</p><p>The surrounding crowd was shocked. For a moment, they did not know if this nonchalant attitude was faked or if he was indeed that confident.</p><p>However, when they witnessed how the sickly young master trembled when he got up just now…</p><p>Was it just a pretense?</p><p>They didn’t get it wrong?</p><p>“+(Suspected, Passive Points+) +652.”</p><p>“Then I won’t stand on ceremony!” Old Ghostface’s face darkened.</p><p>He was extremely gentlemanly and even issued a warning before he attacked.</p><p>After he said that, he took a step forward and his burly body shot forward like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>“Young Master, be careful!”</p><p>Yingying and Qiao’er’s expressions changed.</p><p>The sickly young master dared to underestimate the second head of the Ghost</p><p>God gang and even turned his back on him. The two of them had heard of this Old Ghostface. His name struck fear in their hearts as if they faced a fierce tiger.</p><p>Ghost God gang, local tyrant.</p><p>Who among the locals were not aware that this was the faction that The Divine had left behind in Jade Capital City to protect the Yougui Pavilion and Aunt Xiang?</p><p>All these years, even with Aunt Xiang’s absence, the Ghost God gang had sought out and killed those who dared to sully her name.</p><p>Now that Aunt Xiang had returned, the Ghost God gang was like a sleeping lion that had woken up. They reorganized themselves and prepared for war.</p><p>After all, The Divine was strong and had many enemies back then.</p><p>Recently, there had been many people who wanted to cause trouble in the Yougui Pavilion, be it openly or covertly. They had all been intercepted by the Ghost God gang in advance.</p><p>Not to mention the minor ones.</p><p>The Divine himself was at odds with Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>When the Ghost God gang found out about Aunt Xiang’s return a month ago, they held an oath ceremony and even made preparations to fight against the Holy Divine Palace. That was in the event the Holy Divine Palace had any plans to attack the Yougui Pavilion.</p><p>Now that the sickly young master’s words had directly provoked the Ghost God gang’s deputy, anyone who was discerning enough could tell that he would punish this person as a warning to the others.</p><p>Misfortune came from one’s mouth…</p><p>It was a pity that such a delicate young master did not have the time to enjoy himself properly…</p><p>Yingying and Qiao’er closed their eyes in despair.</p><p>Thus when the lightning bolt flashed past, it suddenly stopped, and a loud sound exploded on the ground.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>“What’s that sound?”</p><p>Yingying and Qiao’er were not injured by the aftershock of Old Ghostface’s punch. They opened their eyes with difficulty and looked behind them. They saw that Old Ghostface had been controlled by a silver-white sword energy.</p><p>The sword energy was so sharp that it could not be blocked. It broke through the private rooms on the second and third floors of the Yougui Pavilion, penetrated the dark copper osmanthus wood floor, and even broke through the pavilion’s protective array.</p><p>“Rustle…”</p><p>When the wood shavings rained down on their heads, the onlookers seemed to have woken up from a dream.</p><p>“Sword energy!”</p><p>“Ancient Swordsman!”</p><p>“That’s right. Young Master Xu claimed to be the descendant of the Eastern Region’s Burial Sword Tomb. It should not be a surprise that he’s an ancient swordsman… But, when did he make his move?”</p><p>Everyone looked over and saw that the sickly young master still had a beauty in each of his arms. The folding fan in his hands had clearly not moved at all.</p><p>That sword energy shouldn’t have come from him!</p><p>“His guard!”</p><p>“Young Master Xu is the successor of the higher void, and he has an invisible guard!”</p><p>“Second head…”</p><p>“Senior Ghostface, be careful!”</p><p>“+(Regarded, Passive Points,+)+264.”</p><p>“+(Suspected, Passive Points+) +558.”</p><p>“+(Glared At, Passive Points (Points, +32.”</p><p>Amidst the sword energy, Old Ghostface looked bewildered.</p><p>He had already tried his best to pay special attention to this sickly young master. After all, Feng Xiao had already given a highly exaggerated description of Xu Gusheng. Moreover, he was in front of him and he could vaguely sense a threat.</p><p>Who would have thought that this sickly young master had not even made a move and only had one guard.</p><p>When he used the All Things are Swords move, he only saw half of a finger flash in the air. He didn’t even see the whole thing before he was controlled.</p><p>“Fluctuating Ray!”</p><p>Old Ghostface let out a low growl. His originally burly beast-like body expanded, and the outline of his muscles became even more visible.</p><p>His body emitted a faint light and his eyes were bloodshot. His white sideburns turned grayish brown.</p><p>Terrifying waves of air erupted like the mountains and seas and pushed the onlookers away. The tables and chairs in the Yougui Pavilion exploded.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>As he hovered in the air, Old Ghostface’s body suddenly catapulted forward and forcefully broke through the blockade of the sword energy. His palm ruthlessly rammed the sickly young master’s back.</p><p>Body Technique?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils dilated slightly as he tapped the paper fan in his hand downward.</p><p>“Yes, Master.”</p><p>A muffled sound rang out in the air.</p><p>At the same time, a figure that was clad in a black battle suit and a black faceless mask, appeared.</p><p>He stood between the sickly young master and Ghostface as he faced the magnificent palm, and stabbed out with two fingers.</p><p>“Point of Path.’</p><p>Thump!</p><p>An extremely muffled sound rang out.</p><p>Old Ghostface’s momentum was once again forcefully stopped.</p><p>Like a shadowless sword, the condensed power that penetrated the old man’s body was visible to the naked eye. It moved from the old man’s chest to his back, and then it pierced through the clothes on his back before it vanished again.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Old Ghostface didn’t seem to be affected. Behind him, the dark copper osmanthus wood wall of the Yougui Pavilion, that cost a lot of money, along with the calligraphy and paintings on the wall, instantly shattered..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
