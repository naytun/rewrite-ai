He was still retching in Aunt Xiang’s room.</p><p>“Mi Zao Spring, foot washing water…”</p><p>“The Drunken Immortal Brew is such a good brew. Why would you use water that was used for washing feet as the original liquid?”</p><p>Aunt Xiang had explained that even though Qing Quan Zhuo Zu had used the spring water at the foot of He Ting mountain to wash his feet and the Drunken Immortal Brew was also made from the same source of water that was about a hundred years old, the two were simply incomparable.</p><p>Even if someone else had washed their feet in this spring water back then, after so many years, it would have long lost its smell.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou still felt a little disgusted.</p><p>Of course, he knew that there was no such thing as truly clean water in this world, but it was rare for him to be muddle-headed. Too much knowledge made him feel even more uncomfortable.</p><p>“Qingyuan Mountain…”</p><p>He turned his attention back to the other piece of paper that had the wine recipe written on it. Xu Xiaoshou read out a portion of the beautiful black words that was on it.</p><p>This word was none other than the ‘peerless genius’ that Bazhun’an had promised him.</p><p>Of course, Qingyuan Mountain wasn’t a name, and that peerless genius wasn’t a mountain.</p><p>These three words were what Aunt Xiang had said to keep him in suspense after he asked. She said that she would follow this clue and find out who it was when she arrived.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at it and burned it so as not to leave any traces behind.</p><p>He didn’t care, nor was he afraid that he wouldn’t be able to find it.</p><p>He was a peerless genius. If even Bazhun’an admitted that, then his brilliance must be extremely dazzling, or he would have returned to his original state.</p><p>Being smart was a must, otherwise, even Dao Qiongcang wouldn’t have bothered with him.</p><p>Perhaps he had not arrived yet, but the other party had already sensed it and was waiting.</p><p>“Qingyuan Mountain is not far from Jade Capital City, but we have to leave the city…”</p><p>“Since he said that he’s a peerless genius, he shouldn’t be too old. He can’t be the same age as me, right? He shouldn’t be. He could suppress Dao Qiongcang…”</p><p>“Who could it be?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his chin and thought for a while, but he did not give it too much thought.</p><p>Now that it was a little troublesome to enter and leave the city, he did not plan to go out and look for it. Instead, he wanted to wait until he was done with his official business.</p><p>After all, there was a bounty on his head. It was only easy to fool the city guards. He might run into a big shot when he left the city and a mishap might occur. That would be too much of a loss.</p><p>“When Li Fugui and the others arrive, I’ll have my own source of information at hand. When the time comes, I can ask them directly or instruct them to find out. It’s also convenient…’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou snorted and no longer thought about it. He took out his Yuan Mansion and entered it.</p><p>He would get on with his ‘business’!</p><p>After she left the room, Aunt Xiang went straight to the private room opposite.</p><p>Not long after, two anxious beauties quietly walked to the room and knocked on the door.</p><p>As soon as they entered, the two women felt extremely pressured.</p><p>Aunt Xiang, who sat in front of the tea table with her legs crossed and her chin slightly raised, had an intense look in her peach blossom eyes. She had the aura of a high-ranking person, and she was no longer as playful as when she communicated with someone just now.</p><p>“You are Qiao’er and Yingying?”</p><p>“Yes, Aunt Xiang.” The two girls replied in unison.</p><p>“Relax. I called you here this time because I want to give you a mission. In the future, as long as Xu Gusheng comes, the two of you will be responsible to welcome and serve him. You must be attentive and make him feel at home… Do you know what I mean?”</p><p>The two women looked at each other and saw the shock in each other’s eyes.</p><p>Xu Gusheng was so important that he would receive solo attention? Did they just conclude a business deal just now?</p><p>However, they knew better than to ask any questions. After having lived in the Yougui Pavilion for so long, the two women knew their place. They quickly nodded.</p><p>“We understand.”</p><p>“No, you don’t understand. You have to serve him like how you serve me… No, it needs to be a little more than that; it would be like how you serve The Divine.</p><p>Do you understand what I’m saying?”</p><p>The two girls trembled and almost thought that she was joking. However, when they looked up, Aunt Xiang’s eyes were serious.</p><p>Xu Gusheng?</p><p>The Divine?</p><p>It can’t be. He was such a celebrity, someone like ‘Godhood called a god at the gates of hell’?</p><p>Even though the two women could not believe it, they did not dare to disobey the order. “Yingying and Qiao’er understand the order.”</p><p>“Where’s Ah Yao?” Aunt Xiang changed the topic.</p><p>“Miss Ah Yao drank too much wine and did not feel well. She went to rest first.</p><p>“In this case… I need you to do these tasks. Qiao’er, go and look for Ghostface from the Ghost God gang and ask him to prepare a generous gift. Tell him to get the mansion on Qianyuan Street ready and bring gifts and his people! Make sure they come over here to apologize personally!”</p><p>Qiao’er froze when she heard that and could not respond for a moment.</p><p>Qianyuan Street was the most central and prosperous area in the Jade Capital City. The people who lived there were not only rich and noble, but also the daughters and sons of the Saints of Saint Mountain, as well as some leaders of the factions and forces!</p><p>The Heaven and Earth spiritual energy there was even denser than the grotto-heavens and blessed lands of some faction and forces.</p><p>Naturally, the mansion on Qianyuan Street was deemed a priceless treasure.</p><p>The one that was given to the Ghost God gang by the Xiang family was to appease The Divine. It was just that they did not live in it after that.</p><p>Now, she would gift this to someone as a form of apology?</p><p>Was it also because of Xu Gusheng?</p><p>“Is there a problem?” Aunt Xiang frowned.</p><p>Qiao’er’s delicate body immediately trembled. “No, no… but who is the gift for, and also the apology…”</p><p>She still didn’t believe that Aunt Xiang and the Ghost God gang would befriend</p><p>Xu Gusheng, who was the descendant of a higher void from the Eastern Region.</p><p>A demi-saint’s descendant…</p><p>No, it was impossible that Aunt Xiang would lower herself to receive a demi-saint!</p><p>“Don’t you know who the gift is for and who the apology is for?” Aunt Xiang wasn’t angry. She looked at her with a smile..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
