(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>In just half a breath, Xu Xiaoshou’s feeling of being stuck in sludge disappeared. He was as comfortable as a fish in water.</p><p>However, as he looked at the vivid world around him, he did not know how he should feel.</p><p>He lowered his head in a daze. His soul had already gained a corporeal body, and even the muscles of his hands were incomparably real.</p><p>He then looked at Bazhun’an.</p><p>Bazhun’an had already reverted to his weak state in the outside world and no longer dazzled like the sun.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to think too much about his power.</p><p>So far, this guy had only used the great buddha chop on Gou Wuyue once in the Eighth Palace. Other than that, he hadn’t used his sword, right?</p><p>You are actually so fierce under the sheepskin!</p><p>“What is this?” Xu Xiaoshou looked around.</p><p>Bazhun’an smiled. “The Second World. It’s a world tailored for you. You don’t feel any discomfort anymore, right?”</p><p>The Second World…</p><p>9,000 Illusions, MO Wuxin, Soul Fighter, Ghost Hidden Love…</p><p>The Nine Major Sword Techniques were at his fingertips. If he wanted to, he could outline a real world instantly…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know what to say.</p><p>He thought of Xiao Kongtong, who had also fallen asleep after he used the Second World sword.</p><p>Perhaps this was the reason why Big Mouth Xiao was so powerful and still worshipped Bazhun’an?</p><p>It could not be compared!</p><p>Bazhun’an quickly looked toward the horizon and ignored Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>The Second World had done it so randomly because Xu Xiaoshou’s realm was too low. It would be very easy for him to die in the divine court.</p><p>After he did all this, he naturally returned to the business at hand and said from afar.</p><p>“As you can see, your divine court can’t trap me. You’ve also seen my abilities.” “This is your last chance. You should show yourself.”</p><p>Divine court… Xu Xiaoshou was surprised by Bazhun’an’s arrogance. He dared to speak to an ancient true God in this manner. At the same time, he savored the chaos world outside the Second World.</p><p>He still remembered that when he had obtained the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy, he had been trapped in a special state and his plans had almost been delayed.</p><p>At that time, there was no Kong Yuhen to exert time, and there was no Bazhun’an to create the Second World.</p><p>The Abyss Island Spirit’s lengthy introduction of the legacy had ended, and he had to rely on his final thoughts to break free from the shackles.</p><p>“It’s the divine court!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally realized that the Heavenly Ancestor was not a good person.</p><p>If he had not been able to escape at that time, he would have been killed by external forces while he was in that muddleheaded state; his physical body would be destroyed.</p><p>As for his consciousness, it was purely because his soul was still trapped in the divine court.</p><p>This was eternal life, but it was also the equivalent to eternal imprisonment!</p><p>“I understand…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly understood something.</p><p>Why did the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy want to trap his divine soul? Everything had to come at a profit.</p><p>He thought of Abyss Island. Before it descended on the Shengshen Continent, there were no signs of life. There was not even a single person, and there were not many void attendants.</p><p>Back then, the Abyss Island Spirit was muddleheaded and unconscious. What could have kept it alive?</p><p>Likely it had to swallow many powerful divine souls to draw power from them!</p><p>Only in this way could it ensure that the so-called Heavenly Ancestor Legacy could be continued. However, in order to ensure its continuity, it had to continuously swallow divine souls-a vicious cycle!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that perhaps he, Bazhun’an, and Bei Huai were not the only ones who had obtained the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy.</p><p>There should have been others who had received it, but they had not been able to walk out. They had become the nutrients that kept the Abyss Island Spirit awake!</p><p>“Tsk tsk…”</p><p>At a certain moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s hair stood on end. He thought of the fact that under the protection of the Heavenly Ancestor’s power, since no one had been killed before, the Abyss race should have multiplied again.</p><p>He couldn’t think too much about these things!</p><p>He looked up and saw a blurry, gray eyeball in the distant horizon.</p><p>It was not active. On the contrary, it appeared lethargic, but it forced itself to maintain its spirit. At this moment, its physical body materialized within the</p><p>chaos and carefully observed the wonderful Second World below.</p><p>“Latecomers, good!”</p><p>Ethereal sounds echoed in all directions, like a great bell that flushed away the dust in one’s heart.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heartbeat accelerated.</p><p>The voice of the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit!</p><p>This guy was really conscious and could speak!</p><p>“There’s no need to play tricks. You don’t have much time left, so I’ll make it short.”</p><p>Bazhun’an eyed him with his turbid eyes that were devoid of any emotion and said loudly.</p><p>“You should be able to see that with my current strength, it’s barely enough to resist the restriction of the five Holy Emperor aristocratic families on the Inner Island of Abyss Island.”</p><p>“Just like you, I don’t have much time left. Once my powers fade, you will be suppressed by them again.”</p><p>“With this confrontation, they will know everything.”</p><p>“Next, if Rao Wangze arrived at Abyss Island to fight against your soul, there might even be many more Holy Emperors who had gathered to kill you.”</p><p>As he paused for a moment, Bazhun’an changed the topic.</p><p>“Therefore, our deal is…</p><p>“The Outer Island of Abyss Island is now in my hands. From now on, there will be no more invasion from external forces. I will protect the void race for you.”</p><p>“As for the Inner Island, it is already time. The five Holy Emperors’ aristocratic families can no longer restrain it. Those who don’t belong there will leave and return to your pure land.”</p><p>After he heard this, Xu Xiaoshou realized that he could only control the Outer Island after he obtained the secondary plane door.</p><p>The Inner Island’s ghost beasts could not come out easily yet. Had the Five Holy Emperors’ aristocratic families imposed any other seals?</p><p>But after he thought about it, it was indeed one of the Seven Breaks!</p><p>If it was so easy to get out, who would ignore the existence of the secondary plane door?</p><p>Bazhun’an had probably spent a lot of effort to plan this, from the Holy Emperor to the secondary plane door. He probably joined forces with the Third Ancestor of the White Vein and the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, who had plotted for a hundred years.</p><p>However, it was still strong!</p><p>The gray eye in the air flickered and stared at Bazhun’an and seemed to be deep in thought.</p><p>“When?” Very soon, the voice sounded again.</p><p>“When it is time.”</p><p>“When will that be?”</p><p>“I don’t know. Maybe tomorrow, maybe the day after tomorrow, maybe three years, maybe a thousand years… But you have no choice but to trust me.” Bazhun’an laughed, as he had the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit at his mercy.</p><p>“They won’t discuss it with you like what I did.”</p><p>“And if I didn’t make this request, I wouldn’t be able to have a deal with you here.”</p><p>“This is your best chance. As for the next person, do you still want to wait…</p><p>Bazhun’an’s eyes were filled with arrogance as he sneered and said.</p><p>“I’m the only genius in a hundred generations. It would be rare to see another expert in ten thousand years. You don’t have time to wait, let alone wait for the next expert who’s stronger than me.”</p><p>The chaos world rumbled as if a natural disaster occurred in the divine court. Even the Second World trembled and seemed to on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sweated profusely.</p><p>Was this a deal?</p><p>This was a f*cking threat!</p><p>Was this how Bazhun’an defined the term ‘deal’?</p><p>Even Kong Yuhen could feel the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit’s anger. His eyes were filled with surprise and he remained silent.</p><p>Bazhun’an ignored him and said coldly, “Three breaths of time. If you still don’t speak, I’ll kill you first if I become a God!”</p><p>The divine court stopped trembling, and the natural disaster immediately disappeared.</p><p>An extremely calm and intimate voice drifted into his ears. There was no anger in it.</p><p>“Good.” Good?</p><p>That was it?</p><p>This time, not to mention Xu Xiaoshou, even Kong Yuhen was dumbfounded.</p><p>Bazhun’an had a clear train of thought and said.</p><p>“Very good, the deal is done. I’m about to pay so much for you, it’s time to talk about the conditions.”</p><p>“First, Abyss Island will be handed over to me. You are not allowed to influence or interfere with the dominant power of the secondary plane door.”</p><p>“Secondly, I heard that you are friends with the God slayer. I need your help when the Ran Ming ruins open up the next time.”</p><p>“Third, this person is called Xu Xiaoshou. He is a disciple of a hundred schools of thought and has studied thousands of the way of the Path. He is far more talented than me. His talent is unprecedented and will definitely surpass mine in the future. He is more suitable to receive your legacy than me. What do you think?”</p><p>“+( Received praise. Passive Points),+l.”</p><p>“+(Watched, Passive Points, +)+3.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t expect Bazhun’an to say such a thing, and he was under immense pressure.</p><p>The sleepy gray eyeball in the air ignored the two people beside him as it glinted slightly and stared at him.</p><p>“Phew!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou let out a long sigh of relief. He puffed out his chest, raised his head high, and waved his sleeves.</p><p>“Heaven did not give birth to me Xu Xiaoshou. The void is like a long night!” The world fell silent.</p><p>Even Bazhun’an’s eyes held a hint of surprise. It was evident that he didn’t expect Xu Xiaoshou to say such a thing.</p><p>After a long time, the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit looked away and accepted all the conditions… transaction details:</p><p>“Good..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
