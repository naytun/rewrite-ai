Their fragrance floated for miles in the wind.</p><p>The copper-colored osmanthus carriage, that was obviously expensive to rent, entered the main gate of Jade Capital City on which an ancient plaque hung. It did not attract the attention of even a single person in the long queue that had waited overnight.</p><p>There was an old captain of the city guards, who squatted under the golden osmanthus tree at the city gate. He held some braised beef in one hand and a jug of osmanthus wine in the other and stopped chewing in surprise. He rubbed the shiny dark circles under his eyes and glanced sideways.</p><p>“Another big shot…”</p><p>“A descendant of a Higher Void Family?”</p><p>He walked over from the golden osmanthus and pointed at the bronze carriage that was about to leave. He was about to call the person over to register.</p><p>The rules of Jade Capital City were something that even the king of heavens had to abide by. Who cared if you were the descendant of a higher void or the descendant of a demi-saint?</p><p>Hence, the old captain stroked his beard and strode over to the city gate. With a slap, he sent a listless team member’s cap flying.</p><p>“All of you, listen up!”</p><p>“Have you forgotten about the chaos in Sky City in the Eastern Region so quickly? Who knows, that bunch of birdmen might turn up and knock on our door today!”</p><p>“It’s been a tumultuous time recently. I’m warning you, don’t let any vermin into the city. If anything happened, you won’t be able to bear the responsibility!”</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes!”</p><p>The old captain raised his head and gulped down another mouthful of wine. He burped and moaned in pleasure.</p><p>He scratched his head again.</p><p>Eh? What did he want to say just now?</p><p>He looked at the young team member in front of him who was tidying up his clothes. He clearly smelled of alcohol. He scolded, “What just passed?”</p><p>“No, no one went over. We’re investigating…” “Where’s the carriage?”</p><p>“What carriage? Boss, you drank too much…”</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The old captain kicked the young man away and looked at the long queue. His mouth opened and closed.</p><p>What kind of answer could a passerby come up with? Most of them could not even afford to pay the entrance fee!</p><p>He swung his arms and staggered to the city gate. He tore the Black Gold Bounty Order off and almost embedded it into the young man’s head.</p><p>“Open your dog eyes and look out carefully. This is what Xu Xiaoshou looks like. If we let him in, all of you will be finished, and so will I!”</p><p>“This includes all of you…” The old captain pointed at the long queue at the city gate. “If you see him, report it to me. I’ll reward you handsomely. I’ll reward you with a lifetime of glory and wealth. You’ll be able to afford up to 30 to 50 wives who would feed you Elixirs to make you feel good!”</p><p>As soon as the Black Gold Bounty was raised, the old captain glanced at himself and spat out a mouthful of turbid yellow phlegm to the side. He muttered and raised his head to pour more wine.</p><p>“He has such a soft and tender look and such a dewy complexion. How did he kill Sword Deity Rao…”</p><p>A stone stirred up a thousand ripples.</p><p>Half of the people who queued at the entrance of Jade Capital City were mortals, and the other half were Spiritual Cultivators.</p><p>Soon, the din from the discussion rose like water that had been boiled.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou seemed to be from the Eastern Region? Recently, the rumors about him had been overly exaggerated. Even I have heard of this name before. They say that he is the Saint Servant Lord Shou… What did he do?”</p><p>“My brother, are you dumb or just pretending to be stupid? You don’t even know who Father Xu is? The saints that were trapped in Sky City; the slashing at Yunlun Mountain Range that killed Rao Yaoyao. Haven’t you heard of this?”</p><p>“What? The Xu who killed Fairy Rao was Xu Xiaoshou? Wasn’t he just a youngster?”</p><p>“He’s just a young man! I heard that he’s not even as old as my son. Can you tell from the reward offered?”</p><p>“Then why is he called ‘Father Xu’?”</p><p>“Young Master Xu from the First Pavilion in the Sky, Xu Deye… The color of his underwear is known by everyone in the world. This f*cking bastard is the same person. Father Xu has the ability to change his guise! ”</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>“Hey, did you guys know? I just heard the latest news about Lord Shou in the Southern Region.”</p><p>“Hurry up and tell us. Father Xu’s story is now an after dinner topic!”</p><p>“It was rumored that thirty years ago, Lord Shou was still an Eight Classics student at the Spirit Palace and he cultivated at that place called the Tiansang Spirit Palace. Wasn’t there an Outer Yard there? Then, there was this Windcloud Competition. It was just a small competition… Lord Shou was extremely talented at that time. In the end, he got first place, but somehow there were some manipulations and ne was not allowed to enter the Inner yard. In a fit of anger, he left with the Saint Servant. After the sword was completed, he went back and killed a million people… F*ck, I’m so happy! That’s what a real man should do!”</p><p>“F*ck, where did you hear that from? It’s great, but was Lord Shou thirty years old?”</p><p>“Nonsense! Otherwise, why was he called ‘Lord’?”</p><p>“It’s true! I heard about it too! Recently, the Holy Palace started their recruitment drive. I heard that like what this brother narrated now, all the Spirit Palaces in various places protested and said that there were internal operations everywhere. Everything was then exposed at the same time and the Holy Palace had no choice but to stop the recruitment process. They were busy reorganizing the ‘unspoken rules’ that reigned in many Spirit Palaces. They also had a major drive and purged a large number of the old fellows who had lined their own pockets with huge sums of money…”</p><p>“Tsk tsk, the morals of the world have deteriorated recently. It’s a pity to see Lord Shou in this light. However, to give him up would be fair to all the students of the Spirit Palace. He’s indeed great!”</p><p>“Great! How could it not be great? I heard that the new generation of the Seven</p><p>Sword Deity in the Southern Region had already been selected long ago. I wonder what the situation is like…”</p><p>The topic of this discussion quickly changed.</p><p>The long line of people either took turns to register to enter the city or returned home..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
