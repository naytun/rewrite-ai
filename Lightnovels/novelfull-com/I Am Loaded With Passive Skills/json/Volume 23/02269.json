Hua Changdeng! Were you pretending to be asleep so that you could peep at the ceremony?”</p><p>“Come out and play together. It’s so lively outside. It just so happened that you’re the missing bit.”</p><p>“Oh right, there’s also Elder Yu who will perform a wave of fishing for you on the spot. I wonder what he can catch… Hehe.”</p><p>Everyone outside the arena was dumbfounded.</p><p>Not only did this guy tear apart the seal of Land of Screen and Candles, he even dared to tease Hua Changdeng?</p><p>Elder Yu stood outside and blew out his beard in anger.</p><p>Fishing?</p><p>This vixen was too cunning. He even got people into trouble. This was really not a coordinated attack that had been planned in advance!</p><p>He hurriedly retreated.</p><p>Once the seal was removed, everyone could not suppress their curiosity and went inside.</p><p>Under the dim sky, there was a broken willow tree, an old table, and a shattered lamp.</p><p>As for the swordsman who leaned against the God Worship Willow Tree among the legendary Nine Ancestral Trees, he held a long sword that was pitted with holes. He looked downward and said in a hoarse voice.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The sound of that one word filled the entire place with a murderous aura.</p><p>Everyone felt chills down their spines. They realized that this was not a joke. Hua Changdeng really had a killing intent. Yue Gongli scratched his head and said.</p><p>“Get lost?”</p><p>“How? Where are you going? Do you want to come out with me?”</p><p>“Aiya, Ancient Swordsmen are so annoying… Pretend, just keep up the pretense! Would it kill you to say another word? If I don’t get lost, will you kill me… Yayaya, I’m looking forward to it!”</p><p>The foxy man replied with a barrage of words. His eyes narrowed into slits again. He rubbed his hands, stuck out his butt, and even shook it.</p><p>“Come on, come on, kill me, Little Deng…”</p><p>“F*ck…” A low exclamation sounded outside the arena. It was unknown who had said it, but it vividly expressed everyone’s feelings at the moment.</p><p>Hua Changdeng didn’t say much. He looked up, and the dark Land of Screen and Candles seemed to light up with a beam that was ready to devour people.</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>The black sword energy was like a snake that spread out from the Land of Screen and Candles in the form of twisted patterns.</p><p>Black mist suddenly rose from the Saint Mountain, and the wails of ghosts echoed in the depths of everyone’s souls.</p><p>They sounded like fingernails that raked against a wooden board and instantly caused everyone to break out in goosebumps.</p><p>“F*ck, are you serious?” Yue Gongli’s face froze. He turned around and ran. “Elder Yu, help me!”</p><p>“Enough…” Dao Qiongcang let out a long sigh and his brows furrowed. For a moment, he was in a daze and was not sure if they had appointed the right person.</p><p>He moved the divine Sinan in his hand, and the seal that had been torn apart was resealed and trapped the Land of Screen and Candles.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>However, in the next second, the seal exploded again.</p><p>The stream of black light flashed in the air. It was actually sword energy and it was a hundred times faster than the previous attack.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>Yue Gongli took a deep breath. He realized that this tough guy was not to be trifled with, so he blocked the attack with his hand.</p><p>“Yin Aura Door.”</p><p>A blurry and dim door appeared in front of him. It seemed to lead to the Yin Cao netherworld and was extremely dark and cold.</p><p>As soon as it appeared, the temperature on the Saint Mountain dropped sharply, and a layer of ice crystals even formed on the ground.</p><p>However, at the same time…</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were very sharp. They saw that in the Land of Screen and Candles, where the seal had been ripped apart again, the old figure had already sheathed his sword.</p><p>“Ahhh!”</p><p>Yue Gongli screamed in pain, and his body was split into two. He transformed into a streak of spiritual light and died.</p><p>“It hurts!”</p><p>“It hurts!”</p><p>“The pain will kill me!”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>Yue Gongli had already died. Where then did this mocking voice come from? Why did it sound like it came from behind…</p><p>Everyone looked behind them.</p><p>They saw a smiling vixen whose eyes narrowed as he walked over from the horizon. He applauded as he spoke.</p><p>When everyone noticed his presence, he changed his remarks.</p><p>“Good sword, good sword!”</p><p>“But Xiao Deng, have you been lying down for too long that your old eyes became blurry? Why can’t you even see my little clone?”</p><p>“Could it be that I was too strong? Oh, no, you’re the one who’s crippled!”</p><p>The figure behind the screen trembled slightly and tightened his grip on the sword in his hand.</p><p>“You two, enough!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang couldn’t take it anymore. They created such a scene in public!</p><p>He shouted angrily and casually wrapped the seal around the Land of Screen and Candles.</p><p>“Great Capture Technique!”</p><p>He grabbed at the air again, and the foxlike eyes covered in the mink sable was caught in his hand and could not resist.</p><p>Even Hallmaster Dao was furious?</p><p>Everyone below trembled in fear.</p><p>However, Yue Gongli’s body went limp, and his hands became weak. He still said.</p><p>“Oh no, I’ve been caught!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s eyelids twitched violently, and he threw the fellow behind him.</p><p>“From now on, you either shut up or scram back to your secret realm.” He growled softly at him.</p><p>Yue Gongli clammed up immediately, but he squirmed about on Dao Qiongcang’s body and waved to the red-clothed people below.</p><p>The hearts of the red-clothed people jumped. This was even more exciting than killing ghost beasts.</p><p>Yue Gongli couldn’t keep quiet. When Dao Qiongcang wasn’t paying attention, he made a heart sign above his head and whispered to everyone. “The moon and the path are fused, there’s no drop in the world.”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>“Oh. ”</p><p>The Ninth Divine Priest God looked away and had a headache. She had clearly not done anything, but she was already exhausted.</p><p>She announced weakly.</p><p>“Next is the Ruler of the white-clothed people…”</p><p>Initially she was quite enthusiastic, but now, the Ninth Divine Priest was too lazy to keep the people in suspense.</p><p>“Beibei. ”</p><p>A young woman dressed in white descended from the sky. She looked like one of the Chief of the six divisions and held a huge sword case in her hand. It was taller than her and looked like a coffin.</p><p>She looked curiously at Yue Gongli with her big eyes. When she saw the man waving his hand vigorously, she couldn’t help but wave back.</p><p>“I love you!” Yue Gongli smiled. “Little girl, you’re so cute. You’ll cry for a long time after a punch, won’t you?”</p><p>“What..?” Beibei was taken aback. She quickly drew back, unable to endure this middle-aged man’s evil vibe.</p><p>“Shut up.” Dao Qiongcang turned his head and scolded him.</p><p>“No, I don’t care.” Yue Gongli responded in a low voice and turned to look at Yu Zhiwen. Just as he was about to raise his face to admire the beauty, he received a murderous look from Elder Yu. He immediately pursed his lips and looked away.</p><p>The Ninth Divine Priest caught a glimpse of this scene out of the corner of her eye and sighed.</p><p>“And…”</p><p>“One of the new three emperors, Dao Xuanji.”</p><p>Yue Gongli’s handsome face darkened, and his foxlike eyes dimmed. He patted</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s shoulder and said.</p><p>“I’ll leave first. You guys can continue to chat..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
