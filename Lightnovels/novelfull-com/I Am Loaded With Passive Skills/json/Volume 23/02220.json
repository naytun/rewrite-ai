(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>More than one?</p><p>Was the power gap among the Ten High Nobles so wide?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a sense of unease. It occurred to him that, among the Ten High Nobles, he had some impression of most of them, if not all, except for a few who were rarely mentioned.</p><p>In retrospect, were these signs not subtle hints of the forgotten legacy of the “Holy Emperor”?</p><p>Kui Leihan, The Divine, You Yuan Buddha, Bei Huai, and Kong Yuhen.</p><p>If there were to be a Holy Emperor among them, it would likely be one of these less familiar figures.</p><p>According to Bazhun’an, Bei Huai seemed to be one of them, but the specifics of his abilities remained unknown.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou himself could be considered one, at least partially.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cast a peculiar glance at Kong Yuhen. No one seemed more fitting for the elusive characteristics of a Holy Emperor.</p><p>“Besides Bei, who else?” Xu Xiaoshou inquired, capturing everyone’s attention, and even arousing curiosity in Kong Yuhen.</p><p>After all, he was unaware of these secrets.</p><p>With a shake of his head, Bazhun’an replied, “I only have a rough idea, not the details.”</p><p>“I had a friend from the Buddhist Sect in the Western Region. He might still be around doing something, or perhaps he’s already done.”</p><p>“He mentioned it once, I asked about it, but I don’t remember the specifics.”</p><p>“Now, I’m even starting to forget him.”</p><p>You Yuan Buddha!</p><p>Not only Xu Xiaoshou but everyone instantly identified Bazhun’an’s friend.</p><p>Strangely, upon reflection, it seemed that everything related to You Yuan Buddha had been forgotten.</p><p>Even what he did among the Ten High Nobles and why he was celebrated as “If the Buddha held grievances, the prison should be full” eluded everyone.</p><p>“What about Kui Leihan and The Divine?” Xu Xiaoshou remembered Bazhun’an mentioning these two names, so he reckoned it was fine to bring them up.</p><p>“You see, you can mention them without any burden.” Bazhun’an smiled. Xu Xiaoshou suddenly understood; these two were likely not Holy Emperors, at least not at the moment.</p><p>“Besides the Ten High Nobles, in that generation, there were many with the potential to become Holy Emperors. Perhaps they are just a single opportunity away.” Bazhun’an shifted the focus to others.</p><p>Naturally, Xu Xiaoshou thought of the Seven Sword Deity.</p><p>However, there was a notable discrepancy in their strengths, and the age differences were significant.</p><p>Apart from the well-known figures, only a few like You Tu, Hua Changdeng, Feng Tingchen, and Wen Ting were rarely heard of.</p><p>“Do you know where You Tu is now?” Mei Siren suddenly spoke up.</p><p>Bazhun’an shook his head slightly, not saying a word.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou continued, “What about Hua…”</p><p>He abruptly stopped.</p><p>Everyone felt a chilling sensation down their spine.</p><p>Vaguely remembering…</p><p>Mostly forgotten.</p><p>Following the battle in which the Eighth Sword Deity met his downfall, a solitary figure emerged from the aftermath, and that person was none other than Hua Changdeng.</p><p>Within the phrase “Yue Bei Hua Rao Dao,” the presence of “Hua” sparked intriguing thoughts.</p><p>“So, this…” Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath.</p><p>“He is not, at least not currently.” Bazhun’an didn’t hesitate to mention his only defeat in the past as if these things didn’t bother him.</p><p>“Hua Changdeng has secluded himself in the Land of Screen and Candles. It’s a pity,” Mei Siren expressed regret, the only one who dared to speak so frankly.</p><p>Bazhun’an nodded slightly, “He is one of the few ancient swordsmen I’ve seen with exceptional talent and character.”</p><p>“Now, he remains in seclusion, not just because of You Tu but more so because of himself.</p><p>A demi-saint residing in isolation…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly thought of this.</p><p>Was he sealing the sword, or perhaps cultivating something else?</p><p>However, with Bazhun’an praising him so highly, it seemed that even with some distance, he was catching up.</p><p>“What about the Feng family in the Southern Region?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“He won’t do.”</p><p>So straightforward… Everyone was stunned. Xu Xiaoshou asked again, “Why do you say that?”</p><p>“Feng Tingchen has good talent and abundant resources, but he is trapped in the mortal world. As long as he can’t break free, he can’t make any progress.”</p><p>“And now…”</p><p>“At most, he is as good as Master Siren.”</p><p>Bazhun’an broke into a smile and a moment of realization dawned upon him as he turned toward Mei Siren, saying, “Of course, you still have a chance.”</p><p>Mei Siren coldly sneered and fanned himself rapidly, “You don’t need to soften the blow. I am very self-aware, and my fate has come to this!”</p><p>“That’s still very strong.” Xu Xiaoshou hastily added.</p><p>This was not an exaggeration.</p><p>How many Holy Emperors were there?</p><p>One with the combat strength of an ancient swordsman like Master Siren could hardly be considered weak.</p><p>Even the slightly weaker Holy Emperors had to be vigilant, guarding against the existence that could cut them down with a single strike.</p><p>Moreover…</p><p>Although Feng Tingchen from the Southern Region had been absent for a long time, he should be much younger than Master Siren, belonging to the generation between the old bones and Bazhun’an.</p><p>Reaching the level of Master Siren in stealth and secrecy; he was truly formidable!</p><p>“Feng Tingchen may not be suitable, but his descendants have been well nurtured,” Bazhun’an casually added, concluding the topic. He then shifted his focus to Xu Xiaoshou, saying:</p><p>“Mentioning all this is not just a waste of words.”</p><p>“In the future, as the one in charge of the First Pavilion in the Sky, most of what you will face next will be at this level.”</p><p>“My advice is to adjust your mindset promptly. Losing is not shameful.”</p><p>Unexpectedly, he would also offer advice… “What if I lose and get captured or killed?” Xu Xiaoshou chuckled and asked.</p><p>“Then, it’s your problem for being too weak,” Bazhun’an spoke with brutal honesty and turned to look at Kong Yuhen..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
