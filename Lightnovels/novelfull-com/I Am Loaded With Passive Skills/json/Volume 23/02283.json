He casually said.</p><p>“Water is good for all things and does not compete with them. It resides in places where no one wants to go, so it is better than the Dao.”</p><p>Without any visible movement, the rain was lifted up by the wind. Thousands of birds and beasts were sent gently to the ground and this stopped their panic.</p><p>This, was the end?</p><p>The Dragon Apricot’s mind went blank as if it had been struck by lightning.</p><p>It was not difficult to set down the birds and beasts of this new world, but there were so many of them. The Dragon Apricot, who was already exhausted, felt that it would require some effort.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was so weak, so how could he lift the heavy weight with such ease and even appeared more relaxed than it?</p><p>Furthermore!</p><p>“Water is good for all things and does not compete with them. It resides in places where no one wants to go, so it is better than the Dao…” The Dragon Apricot muttered. It had never thought that such a statement could come out from the mouth of this seemingly unruly human brat in front of it.</p><p>When he used water as a metaphor, it was concise and comprehensive and it went straight to the core.</p><p>Perhaps this was the reason why Xu Xiaoshou was able to deflect a thousand pounds just now. Did he really comprehend the Great Path at that moment?</p><p>“Continue!” The Dragon Apricot felt it had gained something and urged the human boy to continue speaking.</p><p>It felt that if it heard more, it might be able to comprehend more.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s aura of path energy froze. He was obviously distracted.</p><p>What a pity…</p><p>Really. where knowledge was concerned. he hated that he knew so little!</p><p>He should have finished reading the half of ‘The Book of the Dao’ that was tucked under his bed. Now, he would definitely be able to make this Ancestral Tree Dragon Apricot feel dumb.</p><p>But that was enough.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s imposing aura did not falter. He glanced back at the Dragon Apricot indifferently and looked away.</p><p>“Dao is not constant.’</p><p>The Dragon Apricot was shocked and repeated what he said in a low voice.</p><p>However, it couldn’t comprehend anything, so it gave him a ‘tell me more’ look.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou ignored it and returned to the world.</p><p>He had already accumulated his Force, and he felt that this newborn world could not only be used to fuse with water, but also with the sword.</p><p>“Hidden Bitter!”</p><p>He slapped the black sword that was strapped to his waist and it stabbed through the air. Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly grabbed it.</p><p>With a cry, Hidden Bitter twisted around.</p><p>In an instant, the dense raindrops that fell from the sky, as well as the tens of thousands of living beings that still lingered in fear, stopped in their tracks.</p><p>The entire world fell silent for a moment.</p><p>“Ten thousand!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up as he shouted.</p><p>What he gained insight into was not only the water path, but also the word ‘ten thousand’ in the Ancient Sword Technique.</p><p>Back then on Abyss Island, he had displayed the second realm of Master Siren’s Heart Sword Technique, the Wisdom is Emptiness, that he had obtained when he traced his memories.</p><p>He had originally thought that the Ten Thousand Sword Technique and the Fantasy Sword Technique could also be used in the same way. He wanted to copy the method and try to comprehend them, but after his attempt, he felt that he lacked something.</p><p>He only had the form but he could not comprehend its meaning.</p><p>But now, Xu Xiaoshou had opened up a new world.</p><p>Between Heaven and Earth, the sounds the ear heard and the colors the eye saw, the inexhaustible ‘treasure’ of scenery fed back to his insight.</p><p>What flashed through Xu Xiaoshou’s mind was not only the Absolute Imperial Control owned by the Lord of the World who controlled everything.</p><p>There was also the force of the ‘Wrath of the Great Crimson God’ from Feng Xiaose that formed and manifested into reality. He had memorized it at a glance in the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The Way of the Sword Disc beneath his feet spun.</p><p>A Power Upanishad Formation engraved with complicated Dao patterns instantly spread out; It was so boundless that it seemed to fill this new world. The scale wasn’t any less than when he was at Yunlun Mountain and had killed</p><p>Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>“What does this kid want to do?” The Dragon Apricot was puzzled again.</p><p>This human brat kept springing bigger and bigger shocks at it.</p><p>This time, the sword in his hand felt like it would tear the sky apart.</p><p>The sharpness and strength of the sword were so great that it even suppressed the power he had accumulated in his body after his breakthrough.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>At a certain moment, the Dragon Apricot saw thousands of auras that gathered in the air and turned into a One-sided Crimson wing behind Xu Xiaoshou. It dazzled and looked gorgeous as it covered the Nine Heavens.</p><p>However, in less than half a breath’s time, the crimson wing disappeared.</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou’s domineering aura disappeared.</p><p>Failed insight?</p><p>The Dragon Apricot was stunned.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled.</p><p>He held on tightly to Hidden Bitter. Hidden Bitter was very excited and kept twisting and turning.</p><p>“Illusion!”</p><p>With another word, the Power Upanishad Formation under his feet spun again.</p><p>This time, it was different from the ten thousand force. Xu Xiaoshou’s body was surrounded by path energy, but it turned into nothingness. Plum blossoms drifted down the sky.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot could not understand.</p><p>However, it could clearly sense that this new world seemed to have an additional layer… a world?</p><p>The two overlapped each other.</p><p>Even it couldn’t tell what was real and what was fake.</p><p>Soon, the illusion disappeared.</p><p>Or was it that the so-called Second World did not exist at all and that it was just old and blind?</p><p>The Dragon Apricot wasn’t targeted by anyone, so it wasn’t affected by the sword power. It was able to look at Xu Xiaoshou and questioned him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t say anything, but the corners of his lips twitched and he smiled again.</p><p>“Riddler…”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot was enraged for no reason, and it wanted to smash this human brat’s head.</p><p>This was the reason why it did not like humans. He only spoke partially, accumulated half of his strength, drew half of his sword, and even smiled an enigmatic smile…</p><p>Was he crazy?</p><p>“I’ve comprehended it.” Xu Xiaoshou tilted his head and looked at him. His expression was unfathomable.</p><p>“Oh? What did you get?” The Dragon Apricot was delighted. This kid wanted to share?</p><p>“Heaven’s secrets cannot be revealed.”</p><p>“+(Glared At, Passive Points, +)+1.”</p><p>“+(Cursed, Passive Points+)+l.”</p><p>The evolution of the world ended here.</p><p>When living beings entered it, this world was on the right track. In the future, with the Ancestral tree, the Dragon Apricot, as the World Tree, the future looked promising..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
