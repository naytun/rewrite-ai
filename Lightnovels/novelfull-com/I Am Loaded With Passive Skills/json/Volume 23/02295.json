The world will always think more highly of me, so they will think that they were wrong. Perhaps he has other brilliant aspects that they just didn’t see.”</p><p>“Makes sense, doesn’t it? This is the weight of a ‘name’.” Dao Qiongcang smiled and stood up.</p><p>He slowly picked up the towel on the shelf, dried his body, and stepped out of the medicinal barrel. As he put on his clothes, he walked outside and said.</p><p>“Time’s up, I have to leave.”</p><p>“They are still watching me. I can’t do anything. I can only leave the rest to you.”</p><p>“I know.” The voice in the darkness was very solemn. In the end, it said, “Other than that, are there any other missions? I want to go out for a walk.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang walked to the spot where he had entered the dark environment and stretched his hand out. His expression could not be seen.</p><p>“Then let’s go to the Southern Region on a mission!”</p><p>“The Southern Region is a fertile land. The most beautiful divine flowers can bloom there. That is the Heaven you and I yearn for the most!” He snapped his fingers and disappeared.</p><p>In the darkness, a faint Divine Light Pattern suddenly lit up.</p><p>A man whose upper body was bare rose from the medicinal barrel.</p><p>He leaned against the edge of the barrel, and his upper body hung weakly over it. His wet long hair flopped down and covered his face as he tried hard to push it away.</p><p>As if he wanted to touch something, he stretched out his hand and grabbed at the air, but he did not manage to catch anything.</p><p>He gave up in dejection and let himself hang over the medicinal barrel.</p><p>In the end, he stomped hard and the medicinal barrel toppled over.</p><p>The sound of water splashing echoed all around. As the Divine Light Pattern flickered, what was illuminated was not the medicinal liquid, but pieces of floating paper.</p><p>The man was naked and slumped over the paper.</p><p>He then picked up one of the pieces and quickly folded it into a paper figurine.</p><p>He raised his palm forcefully.</p><p>The Divine Path Principles were outlined in the void and imprinted itself into the paper figurine’s body. Soon, the paper figurine came to life.</p><p>He held the paper figurine in his palm and lowered his head to look at it as if he was looking at a newborn baby.</p><p>After a long time, under the weak light, the corners of his lips twitched slightly as he muttered to himself. “Oh, what should I call it this time?”</p><p>Within the Yougui Pavilion.</p><p>After he sent Aunt Xiang off, the second true body was alone. He frowned as he sat at the table, deep in thought.</p><p>“Madman?”</p><p>” A scholar who achieved his goal by unscrupulous means?”</p><p>“If there’s a choice, you can even betray the entire world, and achieve something because of it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t relate these descriptions to Elder Dao the Flamboyant, not even in the least.</p><p>In his impression, Dao Qiongcang was just like that.</p><p>People said that he was unpredictable, but he was still a step behind on the Abyss Island and lost to Bazhun’an.</p><p>His combat strength was not top-notch…</p><p>In terms of intelligence, he did not seem to lag too far behind Bazhun’an or could he even be said to be on par? Or even 8.1 point weaker?</p><p>However, when Xu Xiaoshou heard what Aunt Xiang said about the ‘most powerful person’ and asked if Hallmaster Dao was that strong…</p><p>Aunt Xiang’s answer was what she had said earlier.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was puzzled.</p><p>“How can there be someone who can be ranked the highest just because he took off his clothes?”</p><p>“This was too showy. No wonder he is known as Elder Dao the Flamboyant…”</p><p>However, when he thought about how Dao Qiongcang when he was on Abyss</p><p>Island, had casually knocked away the chains of Lord Qing Shi of the Divine</p><p>Prison with one hand, Xu Xiaoshou could not help but hesitate. It was as if he had thought of something extremely ridiculous.</p><p>“Flesh and blood are weak, the divine chances soared?”</p><p>It was obvious that there was no answer to this question no matter how much he thought about it. Xu Xiaoshou simply set aside his research and focused on serious matters.</p><p>Through his second true body, he saw the appearance and disappearance of The Divine. Of course, he also noticed the young man he almost crushed to death on Changle Street.</p><p>“Ancient Swordsman…”</p><p>“He couldn’t keep his anger hidden. He even exchanged stares with Li Fuyu. Do they know each other?”</p><p>“And the inter-spatial wheel?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou recognized the item.</p><p>This divine creation was used to search for traces of battle.</p><p>Previously, in the Yunlun Mountain Range, it was also because of his pursuit of this item that he had somehow made it to the Lone Cliff to meet Ye Xiaotian and activated a copy of the purgatory above the trial level.</p><p>“I’ve just smashed the walls of the Yougui Pavilion, and now someone is already here to search for traces of the battle. This is too fast!”</p><p>According to The Divine, they were the red and white-clothed people?”</p><p>“No, the red and white-clothed people are rarely dressed in plain clothes. This is the Jade Capital City, and the Holy Divine Palace is just up there on the Saint Mountain…”</p><p>“Was he a member of the Transformation Division or other intelligence departments of the Holy Divine Palace?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou soon had some answers and had a general understanding of the ins and outs of the matter.</p><p>When the Yuan Mansion world evolved into the Apricot Realm, spatial fluctuations were created. This abnormality alarmed the people on the Saint Mountain, so they sent their people from the Transformation Division to investigate.</p><p>It just so happened that Kong Yuhen sensed the aura of the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff… Hiss! Then why was this guy here? He must have already been nearby, right?</p><p>What did he want?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not figure it out and could only continue to muse over it.</p><p>What happened next was very simple. It was nothing more than Kong Yuhen who gave Aunt Xiang whom he had killed once, a scare, and then was sent flying by The Divine’s punch.</p><p>Even the intelligence department of the Holy Divine Palace were targeted by the big beast.</p><p>“Then it should be none of my business.” At this point, Xu Xiaoshou was relieved..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
