Her beautiful face, that was covered with a light veil, was slightly tilted, and her long eyelashes trembled slightly. This made the people pity her.</p><p>“Cough!”</p><p>On the jade steps, someone cleared his throat softly.</p><p>This did not attract much attention.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen, however, felt something. She looked up and saw Grandpa Yu’s kind eyes filled with encouragement. Her heart seemed to gain some confidence and it felt like a huge stone had been lifted.</p><p>In the past, it was impossible for her to appear at such a place-a place filled with so many people.</p><p>Even if Hallmaster Dao wanted her to be the Chief of the Path Division, she would not agree. Even if she could not reject it, she would let the Supreme Master make the decision.</p><p>But now, it was different.</p><p>The bright moon hung high in the sky, and the stars followed.</p><p>She and their radiance were too dazzling.</p><p>If one didn’t fight, snatch, or advance, it was unlikely that one could continue to stay where one was. One would only be left increasingly further behind. Especially when the legend of the Yunlun Saint was no longer a rumor.</p><p>This was too much for Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>Her peers had unknowingly fallen behind by so much. It was difficult to catch up with her.</p><p>“I’ve thought about what I wanted…”</p><p>“This time, how can we retreat?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s shoulders, which had always been slightly hunched, relaxed. She raised her chin and thrust her chest out slightly. Herr curvaceous figure under her long dress became even more prominent.</p><p>Under everyone’s gaze, she was no longer afraid. Her eyes came to life and a mysterious aura appeared. The vast starry sky seemed to be within them and everyone could not take their eyes off her.</p><p>The budding flower bud on the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe had finally bloomed, and its splendor overwhelmed the fragrance of the entire mountain.</p><p>“Yu Zhiwen, received the order.”</p><p>When this clear and tender voice echoed across, Elder Yu’s eyes brimmed with tears as he stood on the jade steps.</p><p>After he raised this Little Yu for so many years, she finally had the courage to compete with the dragon and phoenix and became a Kun Peng.</p><p>Low voices filled with controversy spread across.</p><p>“Yu Zhiwen…”</p><p>“Oh my God, she’s grown up already?”</p><p>“Seventh in the ranking of exceptional beauties. A young girl had just grown up. Flowers bloom and the wind knows. Today, I finally understood the meaning of this evaluation.”</p><p>“Second on the Path Division ranking? Indeed, she has a bright future ahead of her, but wasn’t she still too inexperienced to be the Chief? She’s only at the Master Stage cultivation level. How would she suppress her subordinates?”</p><p>“Shut up! How dare you talk about the Saint Maiden of the Path Division? Is our</p><p>Path Division competing in cultivation level? If that’s the case, why can’t I, a</p><p>Cutting Path Stage even make it into the top ten of the Heaven rankings?”</p><p>“Ignorant rat! The Path Division is nurturing the next Hallmaster legacy. We want to see the big picture. Do you think that everyone can just charge to the front line like you? Don’t you need to bring your brains?”</p><p>“I only made that one remark…”</p><p>“Then shut up! How can you casually comment on our Saint Maiden Zhi Wen?” The controversy was stifled even before it was stirred up.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen had a lot of fans in the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe. They would not allow anyone to profane the number one goddess of the Saint Mountain.</p><p>Moreover, the goddess seemed to be different today. She was not like her previous overly restrained self.</p><p>She glowed!</p><p>She had finally taken this step and stood in front of everyone. This had been the hope of countless people.</p><p>Only members of the Path Division knew what it was like to be ranked second without having to fight for it.</p><p>How could such a brilliant pearl be attacked so casually and have its radiance retracted?</p><p>“So beautiful…</p><p>Nian, who was also a woman, muttered softly, her eyes filled with envy.</p><p>She turned and stared at the Pearl Gem Star Eyes. Her gaze slid past the tip of her nose under the veil and landed on the exquisite figure.</p><p>From top to bottom, trom inside to outside, even she felt that she was impeccable.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was a woman who could even make any woman’s heart beat faster.</p><p>It was a pity that such a pearl would end up in the hands of some filthy Saint.</p><p>Nian played with the dagger at her waist and looked around. She saw Ao Sheng, who was in a daze; Xi, who wanted to look but didn’t dare to, and the Saints from all over the world.</p><p>At a glance, she felt that no one was worthy of the new Chief of the Path Division.</p><p>“She seems to be on familiar terms with Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>After a slight smile, Nian released all the unrealistic thoughts in her mind. She nodded slightly at the starry-eyed lady, who seemed to have sensed something, before she shifted her gaze.</p><p>The Ninth Divine Priest looked away from Little Yu and cast a concerned look at Elder Yu who was wiping the tears from the corners of his eyes. Then, she returned to the main topic.</p><p>“The newly appointed Chiefs of the six divisions and Wang Dachui will be included in the Heavenly Group. Mobilize the members of each division and be on standby.”</p><p>“During the Heavenly Group’s operation, other than the orders from Team</p><p>Leader Dao Qiongcang, they will not accept any orders from anyone else.”</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao’s orders must be carried out. No delay, no questions, no resistance.”</p><p>“Everyone, is that clear?”</p><p>After everyone consented in unison, a smile appeared on the face of the Ninth Divine Priest.</p><p>“Finally, I will announce the new members of the Council of Ten.”</p><p>Everyone’s attention was instantly caught and their eyes glowed in anticipation.</p><p>The six divisions were just small fry, and the young were still young. No matter how strong they were, they wouldn’t gain much recognition if they didn’t have any achievements.</p><p>After all, the combined ages of the new Chiefs of Divisions might not even be as old as the old ashes present.</p><p>However, the Council of Ten was a different story.</p><p>Under such a delicate situation, how could the higher void still be a part of the Council of Ten? I’m afraid it won’t work anymore!</p><p>So, there should be new Saints right?</p><p>Moreover, in order to secure this position, one had to be the best of the best..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
