This was the real Secular Sword!</p><p>He quickly adapted to the rhythm here.</p><p>As he walked, he took out the paper fan from Master Siren that Bazhun’an had prepared for him from his sleeve. On it was the name that Bazhun’an had given him.</p><p>“Xu Gusheng.”</p><p>Qiao’er’s gaze shifted from the few flamboyant words on the paper fan and stared at the sickly and pale face in front of her with great care.</p><p>“Xu Gusheng, Gusheng, Gusheng…”</p><p>“The old is gone, but the new is born, bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new. Young Master’s name is really nice!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know that this lousy name could be analyzed in such a manner. He thought to himself, “No wonder this Yougui Pavilion is such an Exotic Pavilion. The people here are so cultured!</p><p>“Where is Young Master from? Is it the higher void Xu Family?”</p><p>“+(Detected. Passive Points+)+l.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lowered his head and saw that this Yingying girl did not know who the higher void Xu family was at all. He hurriedly averted his face and did not dare to look at her again.</p><p>On the back of the paper fan was a landscape painting. The mountain in the painting resembled a sword and it was a masterpiece that depicted chivalry. It was painted by Bazhun’an.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou flipped it over and said proudly.</p><p>“Burial Sword Tomb.”</p><p>The Eastern region’s Burial Sword Tomb had only accepted Gu Qingyi and a few legacy disciples, but there were many who had gone to the mountain to worship and undergo refinement.</p><p>It was rumored that if one had the talent and fate, one would be able to see the Seven Sword Deity, Wen Ting who walked about the mountains and preached, then flew up among the branches and turn into a phoenix. The person could then be considered to be half an anonymous disciple.</p><p>Those mountain worshippers were proud of it, and all those who received guidance claimed to be disciples of the Burial Sword Tomb.</p><p>Wen Ting did not mind.</p><p>As time passed, the Burial Sword Tomb had many more ‘outer disciples’, some of whom were real and some were fake.</p><p>Qiao’er and Yingying were startled.</p><p>In the Eastern Region, this name was famous and well-known.</p><p>Now that they were in the Central Region, the two of them thought for a while before they grasped the meaning of what had just been said.</p><p>“Young Master Xu is from the Eastern Region?!”</p><p>They glanced at the black sword at the sickly young master’s waist. The sword moved slightly and let out a happy cry.</p><p>This sword had a spirit!</p><p>Qiao’er and Yingying looked at each other in shock and the joy in their eyes increased.</p><p>Eastern Region ancient swordsman…</p><p>In addition to such a sickly, soft, and delectable face…</p><p>This Young Master Xu was one of the best!</p><p>“Of course.</p><p>When the young master nodded, Qiao’er and Yingying hurriedly welcomed this master into the pavilion. They did not dare to speak about any connections. They said that perhaps Miss Ah Yao would also show up today and it was not just a gimmick.</p><p>The Yougui Pavilion had a whole lot going on inside.</p><p>From the outside, it looked like a three-story pavilion, but inside, it was actually huge.</p><p>The luminous night pearls that hung above the ceiling glowed with a dim light and gave the place a romantic ambience. Many famous landscape paintings were hung on the wall, and everyone left their writings that displayed their elegant calligraphy.</p><p>There were dozens of tea tables in the two courtyards on the left and right sides of the ground floor, separated by screens. In the middle, a circular ladder made of osmanthus wood arched up and led a secluded place partitioned off by a curtain.</p><p>The ethereal sound of flutes and harps floated in from four directions and attracted the attention of all kinds of distinguished guests who were dressed in luxurious clothes and toasted one another.</p><p>Everyone’s gaze shifted to the side and finally returned to the graceful figure who danced on the high platform in the inner court.</p><p>If the wine didn’t make one intoxicated, one would still be intoxicated!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked around and felt as if he had entered into paradise. He was already a little drunk.</p><p>He pushed Qiao’er and Yingying away as they tried to cling on to him and covered his lips with the handle of the fan as he coughed slightly.</p><p>The sound of his cough wasn’t loud.</p><p>However, it attracted the attention of hundreds of people at the bottom. Even the dancer on the stage stopped for a moment and looked around.</p><p>“Who is it!”</p><p>“Who is this? He used his spiritual source so casually. Who here doesn’t have the Innate Stage Master Stage cultivation level? Does he think he’s the number one person here?”</p><p>“How disappointing! Come, Miss Yan’er, let’s continue…”</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>“F”ck, Qiao’er, Yingying, what kind of dog shit luck is this? How did you both manage to attract such a sickly young master that looked so pitiful?” Even the doors upstairs opened.</p><p>A girl who had strong spiritual senses leaned against the railing and cast a covert look below.</p><p>The next second, she ran downstairs. “Young Master!”</p><p>“+(Glared at, Passive Points), +365.” +( Infatuated. Passive Points), +128.” “+( Liked. Passive Points), +154. “+(Seduced, Passive Points +), +66.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost laughed out loud.</p><p>He knew that he had come to the right place. This was Heaven on earth.</p><p>“Gentlemen!”</p><p>The sickly young master cupped his hands and flung away the folding fan in his hand. He laughed loudly.</p><p>“Everyone, eat and drink as you please. Today, I will foot all the bills!” The entire place went deathly silent, so silent that one could hear a pin drop.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were fixed on the paper fan.</p><p>“I am Xu Gusheng.”</p><p>In the next second, a rousing cheer broke out in the Yougui Pavilion. Everyone raised their glasses and bowed in unison. “Thank you, Young Master Xu!”</p><p>“+(Received Gratitude. Passive Points),+561.” “+(Received Infatuation. Passive Points), +642.”</p><p>Even Qiao’er and Yingying was shocked.</p><p>The price of the Yougui Pavilion wasn’t cheap. If one were to book it for the entire day, inclusive of the second and third floors, how much money would it cost?</p><p>With one sentence, millions of Spiritual Crystals were scattered…</p><p>Sick wastrel!</p><p>The more one looked at him, the more he was favored!</p><p>“Young Master, are you here for Miss Ah Yao too?” Qiao’er’s eyes were filled with resentment.</p><p>“Ah Yao?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head slightly and mimicked the subtle smile unique to the people here and Old Man Li. He waved the paper fan like a regular customer.</p><p>“No, no.”</p><p>“The person I’m looking for is Aunt Xiang.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang?</p><p>Qiao’er and Yingying’s delicate bodies trembled, and their beautiful faces suddenly turned pale.</p><p>The guests and ladies on the first and second floor were also petrified and dumbfounded as if they had seen a ghost.</p><p>“+(Stunned. Passive Points), +666..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
