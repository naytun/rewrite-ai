When the opportunity arrived, they could go up at any time. It would be a holy land for wandering cultivators that was no less than the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe and the four-hill mountain!”</p><p>“The Holy Divine Palace was alerted and wanted to recruit them, but they were chased away by the five of them.”</p><p>How could it be like this?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. How dare they?</p><p>Aunt Xiang read his mind and smiled. “The Five Evil Guys are only evil and don’t cause trouble. The Holy Divine Palace won’t go all out to wipe them out. After all, He Ting Mountain did not belong to anyone.”</p><p>Is that so… Xu Xiaoshou felt that it was time for a ‘but’, so he said, “Let’s start the transition!”</p><p>Aunt Xiang rolled her eyes but didn’t say anything. She took the wine glass from Xu Xiaoshou and continued.</p><p>“Back then, Old Gou was still in his prime and full of vigor.”</p><p>“He became the Seven Sword Deity and joined the Holy Divine Palace. As an outsider, he took over the position of Ruler of the white-clothed people and wiped out almost all the dark faction in the Central Region.”</p><p>“He was very arrogant. He was once comparable to Bazhun’an, but if he wasn’t arrogant then, who was?”</p><p>Old Gou…</p><p>Was this Aunt Xiang’s nickname for Gou Wuyue? Sure enough, everyone was tne same.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded but did not comment. He continued to listen. He vaguely recalled that Elder Sang’s foundational roots had been damaged because of his battle with Gou Wuyue.</p><p>“The white-clothed people were tasked to eliminate the dark faction on the continent… At that time, there were no Saint Servants, or rather, the Saint Servants were completely hidden away and no one knew about them.”</p><p>“Old Gou had his eyes on another organization. No one knew what its name was or what they were up to.”</p><p>“However, the gray areas and the dark Land Realm of the Central Region had clearly been eradicated. The things that happened after that, big and small, seemed to be controlled by an intangible big hand. That would eventually lead to a situation that was very unfavorable to the Holy Divine Palace.”</p><p>“If the Holy Divine Palace was the Lord of Light on the continent, then it was not known when this intangible hand took root in the Central Region. It took back all the gray wings and sucked the blood of the Holy Divine Palace and became the Lord of Darkness.’</p><p>“Old Gou had his eyes on this hand and this faction. After many attempts and hard work, he spent a lot of effort to get the name of the hand.”</p><p>“The people of the dark world called it ‘Sleeveless!”‘</p><p>There it was… Xu Xiaoshou didn’t expect that Elder Sang had such a past. He had once unified the dark world of the Central Region?</p><p>“In order to catch Sleeveless, Old Gou put aside everything else and focused on this.”</p><p>“He captured people, interrogated them, and tracked them down, but he failed time and again. He wasted people, money, and resources. He was punished by the Holy Divine Palace, and the image of the Ruler of the white-robed people began to plummet.”</p><p>“But he became the dog of the Holy Divine Palace. Or rather, he had gone completely crazy for this intangible opponent. He still chased after him and refused to give up.”</p><p>It was understandable since he cultivated the sword… Xu Xiaoshou could imagine how an ancient swordsman would feel after he faced his invisible opponent and failed repeatedly. Gou Wuyue would definitely not be reconciled, and it was even more impossible for him to let this matter rest.</p><p>“Sleeveless had repeatedly toyed with Old Gou. But as long as this nail was still around, he would be hindered in every way and hit a wall time and time again. The risk of his actions would also increase and the price would become higher each time.”</p><p>“In the long run, it was only a matter of time before he was discovered. After he realized this, Sleeveless found an opportunity to reveal a flaw.”</p><p>“These two people filled with evil fate finally met!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was moved, but he did not interrupt. Aunt Xiang continued. “A great battle was about to break out, but there was no outcome.”</p><p>“The ambush set up by Sleeveless couldn’t trap a high-spirited Sword Deity. If Old Gou had made a breakthrough at the last moment, he would have</p><p>undergone sanctification if there had been no semi-saint person.”</p><p>“He crippled one person! I’ll mark the key points for you!”</p><p>Aunt Xiang paused and said.</p><p>“Sleeveless knew only too well how to deal with an ancient swordsman. He began with his Dao heart and started from Old Gou’s ‘Carefreeness’ Sword’, that was only half a step away. He fought as he retreated and managed to temporarily avoid the edge.”</p><p>“But in a few words, he stated that the Holy Divine Palace was the greatest shackle that restrained freedom, and also the root that Old Gou could not break through.”</p><p>“Sleeveless couldn’t kill Old Gou, and Old Gou couldn’t restrain Sleeveless. The battle ended, and the two of them became each other’s inner demons.</p><p>Aunt Xiang sighed. She clasped her hands and looked around. “Both of them were geniuses. They’re on par. They were really a good match!”</p><p>Uh, aren’t you focusing on the wrong thing… Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly asked.</p><p>“What happened after that?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
