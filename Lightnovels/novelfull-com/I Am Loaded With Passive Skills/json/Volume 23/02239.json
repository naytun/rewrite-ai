This guy used the Hidden Sword Technique and managed to hide it so well.</p><p>“Feng Xiao?” Xu Xiaoshou fanned himself and sized up the man as if he were trying to get to know him again. “I’ll keep you in mind.”</p><p>“Ha!” Feng Xiao sneered as he looked around and did not even look at the sickly young master. “Bullsh*t, the new Seven Sword Deity. Even I didn’t get selected. I’ll challenge them one by one in the future and shock the entire Feng family!” How bold!</p><p>These words, coupled with the Sovereign Stage Sword Will, stunned everyone around them.</p><p>Indeed, the Way of the Sword Sovereign Stage was qualified to challenge the title of the Seven Sword Deity. Did Feng Xiao keep something hidden?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled.</p><p>He acknowledged this person’s strength as a Way of the Sword Sovereign Stage.</p><p>However, it didn’t mean that he could see any traces of the Seven Sword Deity in this guy.</p><p>He looked all around and finally found where Feng Xiao’s strange roots came from.</p><p>This clearly revealed a form of imitation throughout. “Are you imitating Bazhun’an?” Xu Xiaoshou asked thoughtfully as he held his chin with his paper fan.</p><p>“Uhh.” Feng Xiao’s anger stagnated as he turned his head and looked as if someone had throttled him.</p><p>“Pfft…” Xu Xiaoshou suddenly burst out laughing. When he realized that it was a little rude, he used a paper fan to cover his face. “I’m sorry…”</p><p>He couldn’t hold it in anymore.</p><p>Bazhun’an was indeed crazy, but not this crazy.</p><p>Was this guy here to make things awkward?</p><p>Did he know Bazhun’an? No, it should be said that he had never studied</p><p>Bazhun’an before.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t expect that his frivolous laughter would anger someone who was so serious.</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>“Young Master Xu, what are you laughing at?” Feng Xiao slowly pulled out the sword from his back.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly restrained himself.</p><p>He was so relaxed that it was as if his smile just now was fake.</p><p>After putting down the paper fan, he looked away from the fourth-grade spiritual sword and said indifferently, “I laughed because you’re so serious.”</p><p>“You’re mocking an ancient swordsman!” Feng Xiao’s eyes widened in anger. He tilted the tip of his sword, and a black line ripped open in space. It was so sharp!</p><p>This fourth-grade spiritual sword was set against the sickly young master.</p><p>As the situation became tense, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly understood something.</p><p>Why Bazhun’an had that famous saying…</p><p>Why did he not show mercy when he faced any challengers and would kill them all…</p><p>“I advise you to put down your sword.”</p><p>“Hahaha, what if I don’t?”</p><p>“Beat him up.”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a wind blew across the void.</p><p>Before the onlookers could even see who had attacked, the black sword fell to the ground with a clang.</p><p>Feng Xiao’s chest caved in, and with a bang, he sailed through the private room on the second floor of the Yougui Pavilion. He broke through the skylight and flew out.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>In the blink of an eye, he felt as if he had been punched by a heavy fist from beyond the sky. He slammed back into the Yougui Pavilion and dropped heavily at the feet of the sickly young master.</p><p>When he opened his mouth, a popping sound could be heard. The floor was littered with this pig-headed man’s teeth and blood.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>Everyone gasped.</p><p>Was a Way of the Sword Sovereign Stage defeated just like that?</p><p>This sickly young master hadn’t even made a move yet… did his bodyguard make a move? An invisible person?</p><p>“Twilight…”</p><p>Feng Xiao’s ribs had been smashed, and as he lay on the ground, he was not aware that the battle had ended so quickly.</p><p>He stretched out his trembling hand and tried to reach for his saber.</p><p>With a ‘pa’ sound, the sickly young master stepped on his hand. His saber was close at hand, but he could not reach it.</p><p>Feng Xiao tried his best to raise his head. He saw the pale and sickly face that loomed over him.</p><p>“You can’t even defeat my guard, and you want to challenge the Seven Sword Deity?”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>“The path of the ancient swordsman had long been ruined!”</p><p>“Bullsh*t!”</p><p>“What sword did you cultivate? It’s broken!”</p><p>With a crack, Feng Xiao’s saber broke into two. Everyone in the Yougui Pavilion was aghast.</p><p>To break a person’s saber was akin to breaking a dream!</p><p>Feng Xiao, who lay on the ground, let out a mournful howl.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally understood what Bazhun’an’s mentality was like back in the Spirit Palace.</p><p>If he could see a glimmer of hope, he would be willing to let this person continue to develop.</p><p>He would break his sword today if there was no hope at all. Otherwise, he would lose his life tomorrow.</p><p>But this kind of person would probably die sooner or later, right?</p><p>“Send him away.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his paper fan and covered his face. He did not want to see him anymore.</p><p>With a bang, Feng Xiao’s chest caved in again and left a trail of blood on the ground. His body was kicked out of the Yougui Pavilion and into the outside world.</p><p>Heh, I’ll be my bodyguard. This feeling is really wonderful…</p><p>“+(ln Awe, Passive Points+)+858.”</p><p>“+(lnfatuated, Passive Points+)+323.”</p><p>As he turned to look at Young Master Zhou, Xu Xiaoshou ignored the messages that jumped up on the Information Bar. He smiled and said, “The New Seven Sword Deity, can you read out the list for me?”</p><p>Young Master Zhou, who had a delicate appearance but paled in comparison when it was against a certain sick young master, gulped. He raised the note in his hand with difficulty and said in a trembling voice.</p><p>“The Southern Region’s Feng family had decided that the new generation of the Seven Sword Deity would uphold the philosophy of the ancient swordsman: To press forward and fight for fame. If they succeed, they will be part of the Sword Deity; if they fail, they will be replaced.”</p><p>“The list is as follows…</p><p>“Two Elders, Yi Xiao, Li Fuyu, Hua Lai, Bei Tian, and the favored Lord Shou..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
