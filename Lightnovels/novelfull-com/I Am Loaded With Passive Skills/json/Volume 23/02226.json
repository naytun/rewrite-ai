(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Chaos.</p><p>I can’t distinguish the turbid from the clear.</p><p>There were no yin and yang, four seasons, and no rules and order.</p><p>This was a special and mystical space. It was as if one was in the midst of a flow of thick sludge. It was difficult to control, and even one’s thoughts would stagnate.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s chest constricted and he felt breathless.</p><p>This feeling was countless times more uncomfortable than when he used his passive skill to enter a special world.</p><p>NO!</p><p>The latter did not feel uncomfortable at all. On the contrary, he enjoyed it very much.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou subconsciously took a deep breath, but he felt that his soul had swallowed a mouthful of filth, and he almost vomited.</p><p>He felt as if he was about to drown, so he reached out and grabbed hold of something!</p><p>When he had something in his hands, he felt as if he had a support point on the ground. This made him feel a little better.</p><p>But it was only slightly better!</p><p>“Time.”</p><p>A gentle voice sounded in his ears, and the thing in his hand lit up slightly.</p><p>It was as if something began to flow in his life and Xu Xiaoshou was now able to see the world clearly.</p><p>It was blurry, sticky, hazy… He couldn’t see anything!</p><p>However, the item in his hand was the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff. This was something that could be confirmed!</p><p>This Great Psionic Weapon gave this world, or rather, time to oneself in this world.</p><p>As a result, part of the dimension that Xu Xiaoshou was in had expanded. He entered a suitable environment and began to breathe and think normally.</p><p>“Brother was anxious?”</p><p>He saw Kong Yuhen beside him. He had also been pulled into this world.</p><p>However, Kong Yu’s form was extremely blurry in this mystical space, and he could vaguely be seen and was divided into two parts.</p><p>Time and space were clearly separated. They flowed left and right within his human form and outlined the traces of the Great Path.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, his body had turned into two images, filled with complicated Path Principles patterns.</p><p>If he wanted to look at it carefully and tried to commit it to memory, he would realize that his eyes seemed to be playing tricks on him. The two pictures became blurry and chaotic, and he could not remember anything.</p><p>“Thank you! ”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said in shock as he realized that this might be Kong Yuhen’s true form.</p><p>In this special space, everything returned to primeval chaos, and Kong Yuhen to his original state.</p><p>However, in his body, space and time clearly went hand in hand and there was no distinction between which was stronger or weaker.</p><p>“This guy really just forgot; it’s not that he did not know.”</p><p>“When he remembers, it will be when the Time Upanishad that Bazhun’an mentioned had already been completed.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou secretly wrote in his notebook that Kong Yuhen was someone he should not provoke.</p><p>Fortunately, this guy was strong and of a kindly nature.</p><p>Otherwise, his cultivation level was too low. If it wasn’t for him, he would have wasted a lot of time as he tried to adapt to this world from zero to one. He did not know how long it would take him to do so.</p><p>“How was it?”</p><p>An ethereal voice echoed not far away.</p><p>It was clearly just a normal question, but wherever the voice passed, it swept out in all directions. Even the chaos rippled, and the clear and turbid surroundings almost pierced him apart.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s soul was in pain. It was a feeling that was transmitted from the inside to the outside directly onto the pain nerves. It was like the pricking of a sword.</p><p>His entire body was distorted and he could not speak. He could only shift his eyes and look for the source of the voice.</p><p>He saw an unfamiliar figure of a swordsman in a white robe who walked over slowly from afar. He was slender and handsome, his unruly black hair fluttered about and his eyes were as sharp as lightning.</p><p>The tall figure carried two illusory giant swords, one purple and one gold on his back. At his waist, there were two longswords, one black and one green.</p><p>He was clearly so small, like an ant in this chaos world. With each step he took, his aura was like a giant seen in the Swallow the Mountains and Rivers fantasy realm. He climbed up steadily and finally reached the clouds.</p><p>“You are…”</p><p>“Bazhun’an?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked over and felt a sharp pain in his eyes.</p><p>He had seen this kind of peerless magnificence, that was different from Bazhun’an’s form in the outside world. He had seen it once when he first opened the Sword Observation Manual.</p><p>Bazhun’an’s true nature?</p><p>Sure enough… Xu Xiaoshou immediately thought of Master Siren, who was a model teacher and amiable, but was essentially a hideous sword image.</p><p>Since all ancient swordsmen were like this, how could Bazhun’an be that simple?</p><p>Under the cover of his frail appearance, his heart energy had never decreased by half. From the beginning to the end, he still looked like the high-spirited person he was in his youth.</p><p>“This place should be the divine palace that the Heavenly Ancestor left behind…”</p><p>“But just like the incomplete Heavenly Ancestor Spirit, there should only be a corner left. Even the world was incomparably chaotic.”</p><p>As Bazhun’an spoke, he had clearly noticed the abnormality of his original appearance from the uncomfortable reaction of Xu Xiaoshou’s soul.</p><p>He lowered his gaze and sized himself up. He chuckled. “It’s rare that to be able to restore some of my strength.”</p><p>“You’re too dazzling…” Xu Xiaoshou said with difficulty.</p><p>With this attitude, he realized that it was very difficult for him and Bazhun’an to talk.</p><p>After this guy discarded all his disguises, he was so terrifying that no one could look directly at him!</p><p>It felt as if he was in the presence of a Holy Emperor and he could not even look up.</p><p>“Wait a moment.”</p><p>Bazhun’an pondered for a moment before he reached out to grab the illusory green sword at his waist.</p><p>Crack.</p><p>The sword instantly broke.</p><p>Bazhun’an was stunned for a moment. After a long while, he laughed.</p><p>He no longer insisted on drawing his sword. He only released his hand and looked up slightly.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>In the chaos world, Sword Will surged forth from under his feet like a tidal wave.</p><p>In an instant, abundant flowers bloomed all over Heaven and Earth, full of vitality; Nine Swords mixed together and the order came from all eight directions; The remaining one turned into ten thousand, and the world had a form.</p><p>After that, the green river flowed to determine what was true and false; there was no illusion, and the virtual became real; the Buddha held the sword and separated the turbid and clear-the world began to evolve.</p><p>At the end of the world, hundreds of ghosts patrolled the world and opened up the cycle of reincarnation; All kinds of laws were restrained and returned to the original; The human world had been created and all was in order..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
