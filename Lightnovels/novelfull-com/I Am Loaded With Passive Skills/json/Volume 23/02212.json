(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio     Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fell into a moment of silence.</p><p>Even if his Passive Points shot up dramatically, it was uncertain if he could even attain them.</p><p>Fortunately, there was a Sword Technique Expertise to rely on, and he could be considered half a demi-saint. However, with his foundational roots damaged…</p><p>Just thinking about it made his head throb.</p><p>Things would become very troublesome later on.</p><p>“Don’t harbor any illusions. The Holy Divine Palace will send someone to deal with you next. At the very least, a demi-saint will be dispatched.”</p><p>“You have caught Dao Qiongcang’s attention. Others may underestimate you, but he won’t.”</p><p>“Just nice, with an external force like you pressuring Dao Qiongcang, he will either leave Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe or integrate it.”</p><p>After a brief reminder, Bazhun’an changed the topic. “So, let’s return to the matter of the Saint Servant.’</p><p>“Those who are high above indeed view the common people as mere fodder, but when you step on their toes, these supposed Saints will also strike like thunder.”</p><p>“The Saint Servant has always remained hidden and naturally hasn’t received</p><p>much attention. But once it emerges and harms the fundamental interests of</p><p>the Five Holy Emperors’ families and the Holy Divine Palace…”</p><p>“Even with just a slight indication of this tendency, do you believe they would grant Saint Servant time and opportunity?” With that, Bazhun’an left everyone speechless.</p><p>Indeed!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had slain several Saints from the Holy Divine Palace, and things almost spiraled out of control, even prompting the Holy Emperor to take action.</p><p>The Saint Servant was set on threatening their foundations. How could they wait patiently for decades?</p><p>Was there ever perfect preparation?</p><p>Only during times of war could one truly understand what it meant to live in peace!</p><p>Sensing the silence around him, Xu Xiaoshou understood the formidable power of Bazhun’an’s persuasion.</p><p>He, however, remained unaffected and was able to offer his own thoughts amid this sophistry:</p><p>“Have you ever considered that everything you have now exists because of you alone—the Saint Servant, ghost beasts, and other trump cards I don’t know about…”</p><p>“I know what you want to say.” Bazhun’an smiled ambiguously. “This is the concern of the Sleeveless and all ordinary people.”</p><p>“Good, I have a question that others might not dare to ask,” Xu Xiaoshou said directly, “What if you fall?”</p><p>All eyes immediately focused on him.</p><p>Even Water Ghost couldn’t help but look at Bazhun’an, the frail middle-aged man who seemed like he would peacefully pass away with a cough the next second.</p><p>Bazhun’an shook his head slowly and calmly said, “I won’t fall.”</p><p>“You’re very confident.” Xu Xiaoshou laughed.</p><p>“If I’m not confident, who in this world dares to speak of confidence?”</p><p>“Have you ever thought that if you don’t establish the Saint Servant, the world under the rule of the Holy Divine Palace would still be relatively stable?” Xu Xiaoshou continued.</p><p>Everyone, especially the older ones, turned to look at Xu Xiaoshou in surprise.</p><p>Some had considered this before, but it didn’t hold much significance, as thinking too much would only lead to self-denial.</p><p>After the battle on Abyss Island, Xu Xiaoshou had clearly matured, his thoughts reaching an unexpected depth… Mei Siren fanned himself, his movements involuntarily quickening.</p><p>All eyes returned to Bazhun’an, awaiting his response. Xu Xiaoshou, seemingly eccentric, sometimes had a clear-headed perspective.</p><p>Bazhun’an continued to smile.</p><p>His murky gaze swept across the faces of the crowd, lingering on figures like Water Ghost and Mei Siren for a long time before saying softly, “Without establishing the Saint Servant, Master Siren would not have attained sanctification. Of course, he doesn’t care about it.’</p><p>“Without establishing the Saint Servant, Yu MO wouldn’t have become the Water Ghost, the name of the Spirit Division Chief would have spread throughout the world, and of course, he doesn’t care about it.”</p><p>“Without establishing the Saint Servant, Cen Qiaofu would become a master in the Southern Region, Ning Hong Hong would wander the world, and Sang Qiye would retreat to the Spirit Palace. Of course, they also don’t care about it.”</p><p>“Without establishing the Saint Servant, Gou Wuyue would still be a Saint, The Divine would still linger at Cross Corner Street, Cao Yihan would dream of life and death, and Wen Ting would be on the path of swordsmanship. Yue Bei Hua Rao Dao would still be lofty in the clouds. Of course, they don’t care about it.”</p><p>Bazhun’an’s gaze returned to Xu Xiaoshou. Although his tone remained calm, his emotions were no longer singular.</p><p>“In a world without the Saint Servant, ordinary people would still live comfortably because whether there is a Saint Servant or not, the outcome is the same for them—birth, aging, sickness, and death.”</p><p>“But in a world without the Saint Servant, geniuses will never rise. They might feel that it’s acceptable because it has always been this way.”</p><p>“But with a lid over their heads, flowers can only bloom to the side, right?”</p><p>“But isn’t this abnormal?”</p><p>Bazhun’an laughed for a long time and shook his head before saying:</p><p>“Others can endure, but I cannot. Others can avoid it, but I cannot.”</p><p>“A swordsman in one breath, overturning the nine heavens… If I can’t stand the darkness, I will step forward because I care about it.”</p><p>“If I am not born, the world enjoys peace. If I am born, there will be no lasting peace.”</p><p>Bazhun’an delivered these words with tranquility, yet those around, upon hearing them, were struck as if by thunder, visibly moved without exception.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou’s contemplation was profoundly deep, Bazhun’an’s philosophy shook everyone.</p><p>He stood on a higher dimension, always clear-headed!</p><p>Even Mei Siren was drenched in cold sweat, realizing that enduring and accepting the situation for too long would inevitably lead people to acclimate.</p><p>If there were no Saint Servant, no Holy Divine Palace, and no Five Holy Emperor aristocratic families…</p><p>In his era, he would not have stopped at the higher void level, waiting for so long to be sanctified on Abyss Island, right?</p><p>What was it that made his younger self indifferent to being a sword saint, losing the fervor for rapid progress as a swordsman?</p><p>Mei Siren almost lost his original aspiration, but at this moment, Bazhun’an provided an answer: It’s the era!</p><p>In the wrong era, only the wrong flowers would bloom..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
