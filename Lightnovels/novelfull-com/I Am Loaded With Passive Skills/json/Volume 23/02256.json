Finally, he did not have to do everything by himself.</p><p>But then again, when will my Li Fugui arrive? It would be impossible for Aunt Xiang to poach her over.</p><p>The First Pavilion in the Sky also needed such a character who could endure hardships.</p><p>“I’ll leave this room to you. Don’t worry. It’s absolutely safe.” Aunt Xiang was swift and decisive. After she settled everything, she stood up and was about to “I’ll say it again. If you need anything, just tell me. Don’t be shy.” “Take note, you can ask for anything, including Ah Yao.”</p><p>“+(Received Hint, Passive Points),+l.”</p><p>Why did she persist in bringing up Ah Yao’s name at every instance? Xu Xiaoshou felt a headache coming on. Just as he was about to wave his hand to chase her away, he remembered something.</p><p>“Oh right, don’t go yet. Tell me about Elder Sang. You mentioned something about Fen Qin?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s impression of Elder Sang still lingered about in the Eighth Palace. He was still stuck in those seemingly insignificant matters. Now that he thought about it, it felt very contradictory.</p><p>He was the Vice Dean of the Tiansang Spirit Palace who had stepped down from his position because he had beaten up a student of the Spirit Palace. However, he was able to repel the night raid of Bazhun’an’s masked man for the sake of the students of the Spirit Palace.</p><p>After he knew that he was the second-in-command saint servant, he felt that his strength was a mismatch. Even the higher void was hardly a match for him. The Divine who ranked behind him was one of the Ten High Nobles; Cen Qiaofu was the legendary higher void at the Cutting Path stage.</p><p>If one thought that Elder Sang had weakened, he had improved the Penetrating Divine Senses 2.0 and created the Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand. He was also one of the Four Disciples of the Holy Palace. His talent was shocking, and he had an ambiguous relationship with the Infernal lineage.</p><p>Later, he learned that Elder Sang’s strength fluctuated between high and low. It was because his foundational roots had been damaged in the battle with Gou Wuyue. However, if he couldn’t even defeat Gou Wuyue, how could he become the second-in-command saint servant?</p><p>This Elder Sang was too conflicted.</p><p>However, he wouldn’t tell him if he asked, and he couldn’t ask now. When he asked Bazhun’an, he did not bother to answer.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that the only person who could give him an answer was Aunt Xiang, who was also a Saint Servant from the previous era.</p><p>“You mean Fen Qin?” Aunt Xiang looked back at him.</p><p>“Yes, that was the name of his faction in the Central Region?” Xu Xiaoshou racked his brain, unable to figure out why Elder Sang would use ‘Fen Qin,’ but he felt that it was only natural.</p><p>After all, Fen Qin was something quite coarse, and that suited him.</p><p>“You don’t know anything?”</p><p>“Not at all.”</p><p>“Little chap, Bazhun’an is really quite lazy… Then I’ll tell you about it.” Aunt Xiang returned and sat down.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was all ears.</p><p>“In your Eastern Region, Sleeveless the Saint Servant is perhaps famous.”</p><p>“But in the Central Region, about 16 or 17 years ago, it was not Sleeveless who was famous. It was the Five Evil Guys.”</p><p>The Five Evil Guys… Xu Xiaoshou thought about the term and felt that he might have read too much into the words ‘Fen Qin.’ Perhaps Elder Sang wanted the literal meaning of the word to be crude.</p><p>“There are three mountains in the Central Region, Gui Zhe, Four Hill, and He Ting mountains. ”</p><p>“You should know about the first two. Although the latter was not as renowned as before, it was also listed as one of the three mountains, sixteen or seventeen years ago.”</p><p>“Why?” Xu Xiaoshou was a keen listener.</p><p>“He Ting Mountain was the third highest mountain in the Central Region. It’s a land of grace and beauty. All the sects and clans wanted to fight for it, but in the end, they couldn’t fight for it, so it became a mountain that had no owner.”</p><p>“There were many itinerant cultivators on the mountain, and each of them was extremely powerful. There were even some higher voids among them. They did not like to join any sects, so they often gathered at the top of the mountain to discuss the Dao and compete in martial arts to improve their cultivation.”</p><p>“On a certain day several decades ago, I forgot the exact period… Anyway, these five guys went up the mountain and beat everyone up.”</p><p>“Uhh.” Xu Xiaoshou felt that Elder Sang was indeed capable of doing such a baffling thing.</p><p>“Those Five Evil Guys were extremely powerful, but each of them had a strange temperament.”</p><p>“They could not stand the people on the mountain who were so pretentious as they drank and composed poems. The cultivators were too weak and could not defend themselves. They killed the lot.”</p><p>“The people on the mountain were either crippled or dead. In the end, they scattered like birds and beasts… Oh, I should tell you that at that time, your Master and Bazhun’an were already at odds with each other.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was deep in thought.</p><p>This meant that the people on the mountain were at odds with Bazhun’an, right?</p><p>“The reputation of these Five Evil Guys spread quickly. No one knew their real names and only addressed them by their code names.”</p><p>“One was Fen Qin Zhu He, the other was Qing Quan Zhuo Zu, and there was also</p><p>Bei Shan Qi Lou, Dui Hua Chuai Cha, and Song Xia He Dao, the three of them.”</p><p>You’re indeed a killjoy and rude. As expected of you, Elder Sang… Xu Xiaoshou wanted to laugh. “Then what happened?”</p><p>“He Ting Mountain belonged to everyone. How can it be taken over by these five guys so easily?”</p><p>“It’s either for fame, war, or the mountain. In short, time and time again, large numbers of experts would gather outside. There were even descendants from the higher void faction. They began to attack the mountain.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang shook her head and sighed.</p><p>“None of them could defeat these five guys, none at all!”</p><p>“Those Cutting Path and higher void turned from elegant men to despicable men. They used all kinds of tactics, such as wheel battles, group battles, and war of attrition, but they were still beaten to a pulp and fled in panic.”</p><p>“These five guys were famous. They were so arrogant that they challenged all the heroes in the world. As long as they dared to climb the mountain and defeat them, they could join the winner’s faction!”</p><p>“However, after a few years, no one succeeded. The Five Evil Guys’ fame spread throughout the five regions, and He Ting Mountain finally had a true owner… At its peak, He Ting was no less famous than the other two mountains..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
