It was as if he had shed his weak shell and transformed into a humanoid ancient divine beast.</p><p>No matter how one looked at it, this body did not look like something that the weak human species could cultivate.</p><p>Even his essence had been changed!</p><p>“To be able to obtain the favor of the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit could only mean that he was somewhat special. Perhaps…”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit was originally dissatisfied with Xu Xiaoshou’s rude behavior, but now it was afraid and decided to let bygones be bygones.</p><p>So be it!</p><p>Anyway, it was not as if it was robbed. He even knew to use dragon blood to do an exchange with it.</p><p>This human kid was right. It was indeed worthwhile to invest in him!</p><p>What it should consider now was perhaps to strive to become the number one Ancestral Tree in this new world.</p><p>In the future, if this human continued to break through and the world continued to evolve, its position would also rise along with the tide and it would not be suppressed by the other Ancestral Trees…</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit glanced at the extremely weak Bodhi Root with a look of disdain.</p><p>It was true that this thing had some form of competitiveness when it grew up, but it was too weak now. Even if it had the Primordial Purple Mist, it was useless.</p><p>However, what if this human brat moved an entire Bodhi Ancient Wood here in the future?</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit instantly felt a sense of crisis and suddenly called out. “Human… Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“Senior, what’s the matter?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was in the midst of savoring the Transformation brought about by the Eternal Vitality and High Spirits when he heard the voice and stepped forward.</p><p>He swore that there was no possibility that his endurance limit would not be able to keep up with in the future.</p><p>When he attained this high level in such a short time, it meant that other than being limited by the distance of his Perception, it was impossible to drain the energy reserve in one go.</p><p>Moreover, he no longer needed to rely entirely on his energy reserve!</p><p>After the three Fundamental Passive Skills reached the level of Holy Emperor, Xu Xiaoshou even felt that he could casually cast off the Saint Seeds on All Five Fingers Technique and his endurance limit would last indefinitely.</p><p>Human Bomber: Endless Version!</p><p>However Xu Xiaoshou was not satisfied with this. There was still an end to his endurance limit!</p><p>Passive Points: 5062544.</p><p>This was what was left in the inventory after the two Holy Emperor passive skills.</p><p>However, he was not concerned about his rapidly shrinking Passive Points. Xu Xiaoshou exchanged another 500,000.</p><p>As he took a step forward, the thunderous sound of the saint calamity rang out in the void again.</p><p>“Transformation Sovereign Stage Lv.2.” “Transformation Sovereign Stage Lv.3.” “Transformation Holy Emperor Lv.0.” Passive Points: 4562544.</p><p>With a boom, a crash of thunder followed.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit looked at the human kid who swallowed and transformed the endless energy around his body. It was as if there were hundreds of thousands of volcanoes in his body, and it suddenly felt dazed.</p><p>Was this really a human?</p><p>Are you the Dragon Apricot or am I the Dragon Apricot?</p><p>Why do I feel that the power contained in your body can produce better quality Dragon Apricot fruits than mine?</p><p>“You wish to undergo sanctification?” The Dragon Apricot Spirit was deep in thought.</p><p>“No.” Xu Xiaoshou shook his head. “I’m just doing a normal cultivation.”</p><p>This was just normal… The Dragon Apricot Spirit’s sparkling golden eyes blinked and it decisively skipped the topic. “Do you know what is a World Tree?”</p><p>World Tree?</p><p>What was this Dragon Apricot Spirit up to; why would it suddenly tell me this?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was slightly puzzled.</p><p>He wasn’t too sure about the World Tree, but the way the Dragon Apricot Spirit addressed him had changed. Now, it addressed him as Xu Xiaoshou instead of human kid; this showed how important he was to it.</p><p>It was obvious that the Dragon Apricot Spirit couldn’t sleep after it saw his breakthrough and wanted to have a serious discussion with him</p><p>“I know a little about the World Tree, but I’m sure it’s not as old as you. I’m willing to hear more about it.” Xu Xiaoshou changed the way he spoke and said this in a humble manner.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit nodded slightly. It had noticed some redeeming qualities of this human kid. He was quite respectful and humble.</p><p>“At the Beginning of the Chaos, Heaven and Earth were separated. Nine trees were born and they bore the weight of this world. These were the Nine Great</p><p>Ancestral Trees of the future.’</p><p>“Wait a minute.” Xu Xiaoshou interrupted. “I heard that you bathed in the blood of the Dragon Ancestor before you turned into an Ancestral Tree, right?”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit raised its eyelids and ignored this ignorant human kid. It continued to speak.</p><p>“The Nine Great Ancestral Trees had different abilities, and their levels were destined. This would be repeated each century. Also there was no definite conclusion as to how they would appear in this world.”</p><p>“Fate had created me at this point. The power of the Ancestral Trees, apart from its own divine powers, had the ability to control and stabilize the world.” Xu Xiaoshou was deep in thought.</p><p>Did the Dragon Apricot Spirit mean that the Nine Great Ancestral Trees were equivalent to the nine great Treasure of suppressing barrier?</p><p>What had been created by Heaven and Earth, even without the Dragon Apricot, would still have other forms, such as the Dragon Peach Tree or the Dragon Eye Tree?</p><p>The World Tree… Xu Xiaoshou began to understand this concept.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit knew that the human boy before it was very astute. He could grasp everything with just a few words. It immediately looked at the Yuan Mansion world and slowly said.</p><p>“This world was born from chaos and lacked a supreme divine object. However, this item is rare in this world. I’m afraid you won’t be able to find it in your entire life.</p><p>“What about the Spirit Mark of Life?” Xu Xiaoshou pointed at his own treasure. This item had opened up the laws of life for the Yuan Mansion world. It was a good item.</p><p>“Not enough.”</p><p>“What about the Path Pattern Initial Stone?” Xu Xiaoshou pointed at it once more. This item was the foundation of the laws of the Yuan Mansion world.</p><p>“Not enough.”</p><p>“Then, what about these?” Xu Xiaoshou pointed to his warehouse where his spoils of war were stored. There were heaps of secret treasures that he had snatched from various enemies. There were even Divine Instruments like the Inscription Stele.</p><p>“The early stage can only suppress the world. If the world wanted to truly evolve, it would be far from enough.” The Dragon Apricot Spirit said.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyebrows shot up. He didn’t think that the other party was joking.</p><p>Indeed, he could sense that if he wanted to complete the evolution of his Yuan Mansion world, the Spirit Mark of Life, the Path Pattern Initial Stone and the various Divine Instruments like the Inscription Stele were definitely insufficient..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
