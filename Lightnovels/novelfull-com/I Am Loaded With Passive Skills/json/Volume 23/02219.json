(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio     Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>The words instantly silenced Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Even Bazhun’an felt a dull pain in his chest, unable to maintain his silence any longer.</p><p>“Why are you here?” he asked.</p><p>“Mr. Bazhun’an, didn’t you say I could come and take a look? I was curious,”</p><p>Kong Yuhen replied, tilting his head.</p><p>“So, you’re just here to observe and not participate?”</p><p>“If I were to participate, I’d essentially become a pawn of yours, positioning myself against Dao Qiongcang, and that’s something I’d rather avoid.”</p><p>Bazhun’an looked at him silently, and Kong Yuhen smiled in response.</p><p>Onlookers took a collective breath. Everyone was so straightforward!</p><p>Did Bazhun’an originally plan to use Kong Yuhen?</p><p>But Kong Yuhen, being fully aware, didn’t fall for it. He merely “watched” the entire battle.</p><p>“When did you start watching?” Xu Xiaoshou asked curiously.</p><p>With a sly smile on his face, Kong Yuhen played with his fingertips. “When you impersonated me, it was quite amusing.”</p><p>“Uh.” Xu Xiaoshou recoiled and decided to play dumb.</p><p>Who would have thought that this guy had such a sharp tongue?</p><p>He resembled a cobra, the venom concealed until it struck.</p><p>“Now that you’re here, why not do something for Abyss Island?”</p><p>Bazhun’an suggested, looking toward the ruined giant kingdom. “Perhaps, from there, you can find the answers you seek.”</p><p>Answers… Kong Yuhen’s expression changed slightly, and he asked, “Mr. Bazhun’an, may I inquire about the specific actions I should take?”</p><p>“I just mentioned it casually. It doesn’t mean you’ll really get what you want by doing it.”</p><p>“I don’t even know what I want…”</p><p>“After watching the entire battle, you’re still unsure?”</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>“Then it’s worth a try.” Bazhun’an nodded slightly, gazing into the distance.</p><p>At that moment, everyone’s curiosity was piqued.</p><p>What was Kong Yuhen searching for?</p><p>What was Bazhun’an suggesting he try?</p><p>Only Xu Xiaoshou looked wary. Watching Bazhun’an standing confidently, hands behind his back, staring into the distance, he felt a sense of familiarity.</p><p>Wasn’t this the very tactic he used to deceive others?</p><p>Starting with a fog of ambiguity, set up a trap, lured people in, and then had them captured…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wanted to remind Brother Anxiety not to fall for the cunning plans of the thief. After all, he had gifted him the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff.</p><p>Bazhun’an turned back and asked, “Did you inherit the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was startled and was about to deny it but he realized that Bazhun’an was an ally. Still, could he casually discuss something as significant as the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy to someone like the Eighth?</p><p>His thoughts were unsettled when Bazhun’an continued, “I’ve also received it.”</p><p>“Huh?” Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded.</p><p>“Not just you and me, but one more person received it.”</p><p>Who?”</p><p>“His surname is Bei.” Bei…</p><p>Yue Bei Hua Rao Dao…</p><p>Was it Bei Huai, the tearless that left the heavens in sorrow, and a member of the Ten High Nobles?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Bazhun’an, who did not utter the real name but affirmed it with a gaze.</p><p>The revelation left nearly everyone in a state of silent shock.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s agile mind realized something even more chilling!</p><p>They were on Abyss Island, the battle was over, and Bazhun’an openly discussed Dao Qiongcang and Kong Yuhen.</p><p>Why did Bazhun’an seal his lips when it came to the name “Bei Huai”?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened his mouth and struggled to say, “Among the Ten High Nobles, is there a Holy Emperor?”</p><p>Bazhun’an lifted the corner of his lips with a satisfied expression.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Everyone’s eyes trembled.</p><p>Even Kong Yuhen appeared to be surprised.</p><p>At this moment, Bazhun’an, after a brief pause, with a more pronounced curvature of his lips, spoke again:</p><p>“There is more than one..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
