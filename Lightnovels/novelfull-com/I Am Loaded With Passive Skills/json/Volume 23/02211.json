(1)</h1><p>Chapter 2211: If I Am Born, There Will Be No Lasting Peace! (1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio     Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>A plain black command token.</p><p>On the back, there was a naked woman who clutched her knees with her head hung down and her limbs were shackled. It was a very artistic Saint Servant emblem.</p><p>On the front side, there was a ‘Sang’ character carved under the flame patterns.</p><p>“Elder Sang’s token?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held the command token and looked around. He looked up in confusion. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“A long time ago, your Master was considered half a Saint Servant because he didn’t agree with my ideals.”</p><p>“This was the token he gave me before he left. It’s just that I didn’t agree to his departure, and his heart had not left yet.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were filled with curiosity.</p><p>He knew a little about the reason behind this, or else Elder Sang would not have returned to the Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>However, he only had a glimpse of the situation and did not have all the details, so he asked, “So, why are you guys…”</p><p>“He thought that I was still too extreme and eager for success.”</p><p>“To overturn the current situation of the continent and overthrow the rule of the five Holy Emperors’ aristocratic families can only be done one step at a time. We can’t act rashly.”</p><p>“We should wait for a few more decades until everything is ready. When the power of the dark alliance is complete, then there would not be a backlash from the Power of Demons and Beasts.’</p><p>“If we leave it like this, the overall situation can be settled.’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded.</p><p>Elder Sang’s thoughts were reasonable.</p><p>Bazhun’an was indeed reckless. There was only one Saint Servant left. They had not even formed an alliance with the Xu Yue Gray Palace, but they had already declared war on the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>It was hard to achieve anything alone!</p><p>This was definitely being hard headed!</p><p>Perhaps Bazhun’an felt that this was normal, but this was only for him.</p><p>Everyone around him was under immense pressure.</p><p>However, if the Inner Island’s ghost beasts were released at this time, there would be a situation where they could not be controlled or a small revolt might occur.</p><p>Fatal!</p><p>Eternal damnation!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could imagine how much pain the Saint Servant would suffer if he failed in any of the previous or subsequent operations.</p><p>In the Abyss Island battle, the Holy Divine Palace could be said to have been completely defeated. Several demi-saints died, but did this hurt their foundation?</p><p>NO!</p><p>To the Holy Divine Palace, this was not even considered a serious injury. They still had many chances to start over.</p><p>However, what if the Saint Servant was defeated once?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked when he thought of this.</p><p>There weren’t many demi-saints among the elites of the Saint Servant. They all relied on the ghost beasts on the Inner Island. They couldn’t afford to lose a battle.</p><p>Once they lost, given the Inner Island’s ghost beasts’ personalities, they would scatter like birds and return to Heaven and Earth to seek their own safety.</p><p>It was originally a loose alliance that had temporarily gathered under Bazhun’an’s name, and there were even more people who surrendered to the force of arms.</p><p>This organization seemed powerful and was wholly managed by Bazhun’an.</p><p>When he trembled, everyone together with the ghost beasts had to check if he was going to fall. When he coughed, everyone had to think about whether they could end the battle and leave.</p><p>Yet he was Bazhun’an and he was too strong!</p><p>“What about you?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t have the so-called absolute bias or standpoint. He only asked from the perspective of an outsider. “What do you think about Elder Sang’s concerns?”</p><p>Bazhun’an sneered. “He lacked foresight.”</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou inhaled sharply and looked at the varied expressions of the people around him. He thought to himself, “Can you give Elder Sang some face? He’s still part of the team!”</p><p>“I don’t think his considerations were biased…” Xu Xiaoshou chose his words carefully and thought, “Do I lack foresight too?”</p><p>“This is how mortals think.”</p><p>“Of course he was not wrong, but he underestimated his opponent.” Bazhun’an said calmly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked around his surroundings and saw the anger in everyone’s eyes.</p><p>Little chap!</p><p>His remark was as if he had told everyone present that they were no better than trash!</p><p>“I’d love to hear your advice.” Xu Xiaoshou said sarcastically.</p><p>“It’s hard to talk about it. Take yourself as an example. Since you’ve left Abyss Island, do you think you would still have time to grow?” Bazhun’an glanced over.</p><p>“Uh…” The topic suddenly switched to him. Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a while and soon realized that he was in big trouble.</p><p>He had killed Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>It was fine on Abyss Island, as there were restrictions.</p><p>Once he returned to the Shengshen Continent, he would not even have a day to rest, let alone set up the First Pavilion in the Sky to create trouble.</p><p>Would Holy Emperor Rao let him go?</p><p>That was impossible!</p><p>Three members from the Councill of Ten from the Holy Divine Palace had died. Would they forget their hatred?</p><p>That was impossible!</p><p>Bazhun’an looked into the distance and said leisurely.</p><p>“Once you leave Abyss Island, you’ll be the number one bounty criminal in the world. Countless troubles will follow.”</p><p>“You’re an easier target to catch than me. You’re only in the Sovereign Dao Realm. The battle achievements on Abyss Island were actually borrowed from external forces. If word gets out, it’ll lead to more lies. Moreover, you still have a long way before you become a true demi-saint.”</p><p>“Even if you can attain Enlightenment in a day and shorten the number of years, how long would it take… Ten days, half a month?”</p><p>Everyone was still immersed in it and worried, but they were suddenly stunned.</p><p>Was this the ‘Enlightenment in a day’ in the eyes of Bazhun’an?</p><p>From the Sovereign Dao Realm to the demi-saint level in half a month…The Cutting Path, the Nine Death Thunder Calamity, and the higher void level would be bypassed by you?</p><p>Even if there was no bottleneck in his breakthrough, Xu Xiaoshou’s foundational roots were as solid as a rock. If he wanted to break through to the Saint realm, he might not be able to do so even if he took Holy Medicine for half a month!</p><p>“We are not even talking about whether you can achieve Enlightenment in a day, so the time has to be extended.”</p><p>“According to your way of thinking, ten years is considered short, although I believe you don’t need to.”</p><p>Bazhun’an smiled and looked away, “So do you think they would give you this time to grow and develop?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
