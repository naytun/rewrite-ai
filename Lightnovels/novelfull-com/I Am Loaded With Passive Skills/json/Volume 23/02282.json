It was a bone-chilling winter, and snow fell all year round.</p><p>The forest in the south was filled with bubbling brooks and streams. It was a hot summer, and one took to the shade to cool off.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that this was a fully formed world. It would not be an exaggeration to say that it was a paradise.</p><p>He was such a picky person, but it was difficult for him to find any faults…</p><p>“There is indeed something missing.”</p><p>As the owner of this world, Xu Xiaoshou felt that the snow on the mountains seemed too white and unreal. The dense forest felt a little quieter than the norm, despite the full summer surroundings.</p><p>“There should be some spiritual or wild beasts on the mountains. There could be some starlings or even deer in the forest…”</p><p>Creatures!</p><p>Yes, that was the answer!</p><p>As long as there were more creatures, it would not be an exaggeration to say that this world was a miniature version of the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>However, the Dragon Apricot had already evolved the world, so it was obvious that it could be a bit of a challenge for it to produce so many creatures out of thin air now.</p><p>No matter how strong the Ancestral Tree was, it couldn’t lay eggs, let alone give birth to lions, tigers, fish, birds, and other creatures.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought that he could visit all the famous mountains and rivers in the future and capture all the cattle, sheep, chickens, and ducks and bring them into the Yuan Mansion world.</p><p>It just so happened that he could make use of his Cooking Expert skills.</p><p>Of course, it was possible to have all these creatures now. With his Drawing Expertise, he could create a large number of them.</p><p>Unfortunately, they would all be fake…</p><p>In the void, the light of the Dragon Apricot that had turned into patterns became extremely dim. One could just imagine that the evolution of the world had indeed consumed too much of its power.</p><p>However, it didn’t stop even at this step. As if it had read Xu Xiaoshou’s mind, it said magnanimously.</p><p>“Since it has come to this, let there be life.’</p><p>The golden tree crown swayed as it scattered crystal chips everywhere.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked up and found that they were actually countless space fragments. that were densely packed together.</p><p>These space fragments were not empty. There were cows, sheep, eagles, birds, and other animals inside. There were even some aquatic creatures, swimming fish, and tiny mayflies.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou even saw some spirit beasts that were rich in spiritual strength. However, their levels were generally very low. Most of them were at the Acquired or Innate Stage.</p><p>After they struggled out of the space fragments, these lifeforms fell from the sky in a panic stricken state.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. “You can do that?”</p><p>He suddenly recalled that the Dragon Apricot was a World Tree. In that case, other than his Yuan Mansion world, had it not become the foundation of any other world before?</p><p>Definitely!</p><p>So, these space fragments were its accumulation from the past that stored all kinds of life in the shattered worlds?</p><p>“Rain.”</p><p>As it thought of this, the Dragon Apricot shouted aloud. Xu Xiaoshou thought it was about to create the rain.</p><p>Indeed, at this time, the world needed the type of rain called ‘rebirth’ to send these creatures to their destinations.</p><p>However, after he waited for a while, the Dragon Apricot did not make any move.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou understood that it needed his help.</p><p>After all, the Lord of the world was not the Dragon Apricot. This ‘rebirth’ rain had to be completed by Xu Xiaoshou and only Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>With a light breath, he ascended to the heavens in one step.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou reached the sky and stood next to the Dragon Apricot.</p><p>He didn’t say anything. He just took out a drop of blood and smeared it on the Imitator.</p><p>A large amount of information immediately surged into his mind. It was the knowledge and understanding of ‘water’.</p><p>This drop of blood came from Yu Lingdi from the First Hall of Sins and was also Water Ghost Yu Mo.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou slowly raised his hand after his insight into this semi-unchanging state.</p><p>“God said, let it rain.”</p><p>Drip!</p><p>The rain cascaded down on the branches and leaves as they burst into life and everything on the ground became green and new.</p><p>After Xu Xiaoshou’s joking statement, the rain started with a drizzle and ended in a torrent!</p><p>The tens of thousands of panic stricken creatures that had spilled out from the space fragments were drenched by the torrential rain before they even landed on the ground.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou saw this scene, even though he was just playing, he felt a sense of pride.</p><p>The first rain in this world was made by me!</p><p>I can decide on the life and death of all living things in this world!</p><p>His aura rose as he looked at this new world. The path energy surged around him. There was no Power Upanishad Formation under his feet, but he seemed to have entered the state of the Unity of Man and the Heavens.</p><p>“God?”</p><p>Of course, the Dragon Apricot understood what the human boy who stood beside it meant, but it only felt that Xu Xiaoshou had overestimated himself.</p><p>Since when could one call himself a God just because it rained?</p><p>Even it didn’t dare!</p><p>However, before it could mock him, the Dragon Apricot noticed that this human boy’s actions might be a little inappropriate.</p><p>When those mortal creatures fell from such a height, even if they were birds that flapped their wings, wouldn’t they be smashed into pieces after their wings got wet, let alone the cows and sheep?</p><p>The Dragon Apricot wanted to protect them.</p><p>Who would have thought that Xu Xiaoshou’s aura of path energy would rise to a point that even it was moved, as if there was no limit.</p><p>“What does this child intend to do…”</p><p>Just when it had this thought, Xu Xiaoshou made a move before the Dragon Apricot did!</p><p>After the water swamped the Heaven and Earth, he felt that he was already very powerful and that the vast world was nothing more than this and he could control it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already seen the life and death of all things that the Dragon Apricot could see.</p><p>“Humans should be like water..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
