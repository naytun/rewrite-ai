Gu! Sheng…”</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The wooden door banged shut mercilessly and cut off her words.</p><p>When Miss Ah Yao was drunk, this lithe woman with such a refined spiritual beauty could actually play the pipa with passion!</p><p>The wind whistled.</p><p>At the critical moment, this woman who was in such a weak state finally conserved her strength and did not slam her pipa on the wooden door.</p><p>“Reward money…Haha.”</p><p>Outside the private room, the girl’s eyes became vacant as she stared blankly into the distance for quite some time.</p><p>Was weakness also a sin?</p><p>“Ahhh!”</p><p>An unbearable wave of somber celestial music came from outside the door. The sickly young master frowned, closed his ears and pressed the door shut.</p><p>“+(Cursed, Passive +1…”</p><p>“+(Watched, Passive Points+) +1.”</p><p>This was a quaint private room that had no romantic ambience at all. The decoration was mainly in light wood colors, and there were some clothes scattered on the bed.</p><p>She was not waiting on the bed as he had imagined.</p><p>In front of a small table made of osmanthus wood sat a graceful woman in a black muslin dress. Her attire was rather formal.</p><p>She was extremely beautiful and had an impeccable figure. Her entire person exuded an aura like that of a mature peach that was alluring.</p><p>Especially that pair of peach blossom eyes that were full of lust. Just a simple gaze from her caused one to have a kind of soul-stirring feeling.</p><p>“You’re the first person who managed to cause Ah Yao to lose her composure.”</p><p>“Before this, I always thought that her voice would never be louder than the sound of me pouring wine.”</p><p>The woman in the black dress held the wine pot and her voice was extremely enticing. It was as if she used her fingers to draw circles on one’s palm and made one’s heart itch. “She was indecent.”</p><p>“Ha…</p><p>The woman covered her mouth and chuckled. Her shimmery eyes did not stop looking around. They darted everywhere, from top to bottom, from the outside to the inside. It was as if she wanted to strip the sickly young master at the door naked and see through him. “So good looking!”</p><p>“+(Received Praise. Passive Points),+l.”</p><p>“Sit.” She took out a wine glass and placed it on the opposite side of the table. With the tone of a host she poured the wine and said.</p><p>“This is the Drunken Immortal Brew I specially prepared for you. It was taken from the best quality spiritual aura on the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.”</p><p>“In the outside world, if you want to drink the Drunken Immortal Brew, you either have to be a Saint from the Saint Mountain, or the descendant of the Five Holy Emperors’ aristocratic families. You have to be extremely powerful and have a status comparable to the Ten High Nobles.”</p><p>“Otherwise, it would be impossible.”</p><p>The residual temperature warmth was full of immortal qi, and the wine was very fragrant.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s Adam apple bobbed up and down. He was not a drinker, yet the fragrance of the wine aroused a craving in him. This was indeed a little amazing.</p><p>“You are Aunt Xiang?”</p><p>However, when he came to the table, he did not sit down directly. Instead, he looked down from above in an arrogant manner.</p><p>Aunt Xiang raised her head but did not get up. She had a subtle smile on her face. “You’re Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Did Bazhun’an inform her?</p><p>That meant that Aunt Xiang had a very, very close relationship with the Saint Servant and she definitely wouldn’t leak any secrets!</p><p>If not, how could she know that he was not Xu Gusheng, but was Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought about it and felt that it was impossible. With a swish, he opened up the paper fan.</p><p>“I am Xu Gusheng.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang stared at him with a smile as she watched him keep up the pretense.</p><p>It was only when the sickly young master frowned and his expression became a little strained after being stared at so rudely for a long time, that she rapped on the table and stood up.</p><p>“You’re just as he said. You’re extremely cautious and suspicious. You’re extremely cunning. ”</p><p>“Bazhun’an.”</p><p>Bazhun’an directly said it?</p><p>At this point, any ordinary person’s expression would probably be tense.</p><p>Xu Xiashou took note that this was the Central Region, Dao Qiongcang’s territory. Dao Qiongcang had just lost a big game of chess and everything he had was gone.</p><p>Even the whole of the Yougui Pavilion was fake, Old Man Li the coachman was someone from the Transformation Division. Aunt Xiang was Dao Qiongcang in disguise and he had been locked on as soon as he left Abyss Island and was thus involved in the big picture. All sorts of ridiculous possibilities had appeared in Xu Xiaoshou’s mind.</p><p>How could he let down his guard and reveal his identity after a mere two sentences?</p><p>“Aunt Xiang did not talk about what happened downstairs. Instead, you spoke about the outside world and did not elaborate…” The sickly young master’s fan movements did not quicken nor did it slow down. “May I ask, what are your intentions?”</p><p>Aunt Xiang looked at this weak young master. Her peachlike cheeks moved, and her eyes narrowed. Finally, she could not help but cover her mouth and laugh.</p><p>“Hehe… ”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you’re too cute. Don’t tell me you think I’m Elder Dao the Flamboyant?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was really shocked. How could she guess that?</p><p>Before he could say anything, Aunt Xiang took out a black command token from the space necklace between her snow-white crevice and slapped it on the table.</p><p>“Little cutie, take a look for yourself.”</p><p>“Your nerves are too taut. It’s time to relax. Bazhun’an made the right decision to send you to the Yougui Pavilion.”</p><p>“+(Provoked, Passive Points), +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyebrows shot up, but he remained unmoved as he picked up the black command token.</p><p>On the back of the command token was the emblem of the Saint Servant and on the front was the word ‘God’. That unique sword cognition aura came from</p><p>Bazhun’an.</p><p>Saint Servant Token!</p><p>And it was one that he had never seen before!</p><p>“You are the sixth Saint Servant… No, the third?” The sickly young master dropped his mask and there was a look of disbelief on his face.</p><p>“Oh? It looks like you haven’t recognized the whole person.” Aunt Xiang smiled and shook her head. “I’m not, but my husband is..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
