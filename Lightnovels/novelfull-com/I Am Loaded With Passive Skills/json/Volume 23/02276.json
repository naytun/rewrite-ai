It did not return to the energy reserve, only the process of ‘exhaling’ and ‘inhaling’. Now, it was equivalent to his entire body being the energy reserve, and every part of his body was filled with the spiritual source!</p><p>The process of breathing in and out in this heavenly cycle cleansed, refined,</p><p>and purified the precious body repeatedly…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s body had long since been devoid of impurities. This was after he had leveled up and completed his ‘strengthening’.</p><p>When the remaining Acquired Stage aura on his body was washed away by the Heaven and Earth spiritual energy, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had returned to his original state.</p><p>Even his breathing seemed to carry the Innate Stage fetal energy that was so refreshing.</p><p>His entire body emitted a fragrance, as if he had transformed into a peerless precious medicine. If someone really refined and ate him, it would probably be no less than swallowing a Holy Medicine.</p><p>And this was only the first change brought about by the Holy Emperor Lv.o Breathing Technique. With this passive breath in the future, this human-shaped Holy Medicine would continue to advance.</p><p>“I’ve turned into Tang Seng the monk?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at himself from head to toe and he suddenly fell back.</p><p>He didn’t even use his spiritual strength. With a thought, his body floated up.</p><p>The Heaven and Earth spiritual energy and the myriad of elements tried to get close to him, as if he was one of them and the master of the elements. Whether they walked or floated… Any state would revert to the Innate Stage.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized that he was different from the others.</p><p>If he thought about it, this meant that he was now a true Innate Stage Saint. Just like some ghost beasts, he was born extraordinary. This was a change in his nature.</p><p>Most of the human demi-saints outside relied on cultivation to shed their mortal bodies. However, if they could not shed their last breath, they would always be Acquired Stage Saints.</p><p>“Not only that, but I’ve also become desensitized!”</p><p>As his body breathed on its own, Xu Xiaoshou flipped his palms. He still felt incredulous.</p><p>In the past, when he completely released his Breathing Technique, it felt so good that he wanted to explode.</p><p>There was no reaction now, just like a normal person. At most, his body felt cold when he breathed, and there was a faint minty feeling.</p><p>“Heavenly Ancestor’s power?”</p><p>“After I accepted the inheritance, Bazhun’an told me that I was already half an Abyss Clan person.”</p><p>“And the void attendant had a special characteristic, which is that it can swallow the energy of others. That’s why I can withstand the energy level of spiritual energy and not feel uncomfortable?”</p><p>This was a huge breakthrough!</p><p>Did this mean that he could take unlimited pills and even Holy Medicine in the future?</p><p>“Oh, I should still feel something after I take the Holy Medicine, but the rest time will definitely be shortened.”</p><p>“From the looks of it, swallowing the ninety-nine Dragon Apricot fruits won’t take much time.”</p><p>The issue of time was no longer a problem for Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He raised his hand and indeed, the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff appeared in his palm.</p><p>The Time Dao Discs appeared under Xu Xiaoshou’s feet. He entered the Unity of Man and the Heavens state and closed his eyes.</p><p>Not long after, he threw another second true body outside.</p><p>“How is it?”</p><p>“I feel something.”</p><p>“What about now?”</p><p>“It’s really slow!”</p><p>“What about now?” “Alright, the flow of time has really changed. Test your limit again…”</p><p>“This is the limit!”</p><p>After he recalled his second true body back to his Yuan Mansion world, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes widened in excitement.</p><p>His comprehension of time was indeed not very good.</p><p>However, with the help of the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff, he could now adjust the ratio of the flow of time in the Yuan Mansion world to ten to one of the outside world.</p><p>It could be fast or slow. The limit was this ratio, that should be related to the cultivation level.</p><p>But it was enough!</p><p>This meant that in the future, when he was injured, he would be able to have a speedier recovery; when he cultivated in the turtle abode, he could slow down and control it freely.</p><p>Moreover, the area covered the entire Yuan Mansion world and was not limited to him alone. For example, the spiritual herbs that were planted here would mature at a greater speed than those on the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>The only flaw was that he needed to hold the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff in his Yuan Mansion world.</p><p>However, with his second true body, he could handle this mission on normal days.</p><p>For example, his true body would hold the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff while his second true body would step on the Time Dao Discs in the Yuan Mansion world..</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was excited at the mere thought of this.</p><p>He had once imagined a time when he would be able to obtain a magic treasure that could alter the flow of time and completely transform the Yuan Mansion world into a cultivation space that would help his own people to grow.</p><p>He had never thought that one day, he would be able to do so by himself.</p><p>“Time…”</p><p>This was indeed the power of the time attribute!</p><p>After he calmed down, Xu Xiaoshou was in no hurry to consume the Dragon Apricot fruits. This was the last part of his plan. After all, he could eat them at any time.</p><p>He spent another 1,000,000 Passive Points to exchange for 10 Level Four Skill Points.</p><p>“Eternal Vitality Sovereign Stage Lv.l.” “High Spirits, Sovereign Stage Lv.l.” “Eternal Vitality, Holy Emperor Lv.0.” “High Spirits Holy Emperor Lv.0.”</p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p>The Yuan Mansion world was once again struck by lightning.</p><p>However, these two Fundamental Passive Skills did not incur the saint calamity, only the sound of thunder.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer was awakened again. Its eyes were locked on Xu Xiaoshou in the distance and it felt confused and curious.</p><p>This human could only summon the Nine Death Thunder Calamity at the start.</p><p>The subsequent ‘Plundering’ technique could also cause the sound of the saint calamity. Now, there were two consecutive sounds.</p><p>“Strange…”</p><p>“How strange! ”</p><p>Thereafter, the Dragon Apricot Spirit could already feel the surging power that was contained in Xu Xiaoshou’s body..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
