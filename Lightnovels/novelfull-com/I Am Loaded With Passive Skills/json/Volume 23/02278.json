This world will automatically unravel from its original body. Many years later, it can evolve from a small world to a greater world.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit wanted to become the World Tree of the Yuan Mansion world?</p><p>His eyes lit up. The Yuan Mansion world had the potential to become a greater world like the Shengshen Continent. He would be the master of this world…</p><p>“However, I still need one more item.”</p><p>“What is it?” Xu Xiaoshou’s way of speaking had been assimilated.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit fixed its gaze on the human boy’s hand.</p><p>“The space of the Ancestral Tree can be relied on, but the path for the transformation of time is hard to find.</p><p>“Only this thing can borrow the power of time to evolve the greater world.” At this point, the Dragon Apricot Spirit’s eyes held traces of doubt.</p><p>It had taken a fancy to the Yuan Mansion world and the potential of the human boy in front of it, but it still lacked the time required for the world to evolve. However, the item in Xu Xiaoshou’s hand could make up for this shortcoming.</p><p>If this thing was contracted to it, the laws of space and time would be constructed, and the Yuan Mansion world would evolve into a greater world. It was only a matter of time before this happened.</p><p>“The Time Ancestor Shadow Staff?” Xu Xiaoshou lowered his head. He didn’t expect the Dragon Apricot Spirit to be able to see it.</p><p>However, he soon sighed. “I’m afraid that won’t do. The Time Ancestor Shadow Staff was given to me by someone else. Even I can’t control it properly at the moment. It’s too unstable to become the Treasure of suppressing barrier.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was afraid that he would accidentally summon the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff during a battle. What if the Yuan Mansion world exploded?</p><p>“You don’t have to worry about that.”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit shook its illusory dragon head. “The world would be set up by me. The Time Ancestor Shadow Staff is just the icing on the cake to speed up the evolution.”</p><p>“You can control it?” Xu Xiaoshou raised the item in his hand.</p><p>“Time is formless and cannot be controlled, so we can only make use of it.” The Dragon Apricot Spirit said.</p><p>“We can’t control it. What if something happened?” Xu Xiaoshou was dejected.</p><p>He was both afraid and suspicious. He thought that if even the Dragon Apricot Spirit could not control the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff, then what the hell was Kong Yuhen’s gadget? How could he have sent this item out?</p><p>“That’s not true. It’s enough for me to have this staff in the Dast. As for the follow-up…” The Dragon Apricot Spirit didn’t say anything else. It just smiled and looked at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Follow-up?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment and then he immediately understood.</p><p>The Time Ancestor Shadow Staff could be used to survive the early stages, but wouldn’t he be able to rely on himself in the late-stage?</p><p>Were the Time Dao Discs just display pieces?</p><p>It didn’t matter if he didn’t comprehend it well. If he used the Passive Points and the Profound Dao Seed to go up later, wouldn’t he be the next Kong Yuhen?</p><p>At that time, not to mention the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff, his existence would be equivalent to half of the Time Ancestor!</p><p>“I understand.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was tempted. He understood that the Dragon Apricot Spirit had taken a fancy to him, someone who had extraordinary potential.</p><p>Its responsibility was to evolve the world and stabilize the space.</p><p>As for the time, just leave it to the Time Dao Discs that he had seen earlier!</p><p>“But why did Senior suddenly have such an intention?” After being played for too long, Xu Xiaoshou was subconsciously on his guard. He suspected that the Dragon Apricot Spirit might try to trick him.</p><p>When the Dragon Apricot Spirit heard this, it silently raised its eyes and looked into the distance. There was an indescribable bitterness within its eyes.</p><p>It was actually tired.</p><p>From the Dragon Cave, to the Abyss Island, to the current Yuan Mansion world…There was no place that was safe!</p><p>It was always being poached and moved passively.</p><p>In the past, it didn’t matter, but now the Dragon Apricot Spirit seemed to have sensed something and had a vague awareness that the undercurrent of the era had arrived.</p><p>Previously, Xu Xiaoshou had said that if all the Dragon Apricot fruits on it were taken and thrown onto the Shengshen Continent, many demi-saints would rush over to divide it up. The Dragon Apricot Spirit could well imagine it.</p><p>It didn’t like to be on the move anymore, nor did it want to relocate. It didn’t want to be picked up by another person again.</p><p>From the Dragon Cave, to the Abyss Island, to the Land Realm… Each time, it took more effort to poach its own people. This proved the potential of the human kid in front of him.</p><p>Since he had such potential, and the extent of his cultivation just now was different from ordinary people, it was obvious that he had extraordinary talent. The Yuan Mansion world also happened to have the foundation to become a world; It only lacked a World Tree.</p><p>Everything was ready!</p><p>All that was left was a thought from it and a portion of its power to protect this world. This was equivalent to using a world to protect itself.</p><p>Why not?</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit wanted a home…</p><p>However, it was impossible to say this directly, as it was too superficial. Therefore, the Dragon Apricot Spirit looked at the human boy and said.</p><p>“Two percent of the human world is determined by fate. If they don’t accept what the Heavens gave, they will suffer.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart shook. He felt enlightened by the ethereal Saint Language and felt like he was the chosen one.</p><p>He thought for a moment and felt that the Dragon Apricot Spirit wasn’t someone who would joke around. Perhaps it was just tired and wanted to settle down. So he took a step back and temporarily stopped the time. He handed over the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff and said.</p><p>“Senior, please do your stuff..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
