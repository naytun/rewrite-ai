She clasped her pipa and seemed slightly distracted.</p><p>She was from the Yougui Pavilion and had seen all kinds of Saints on the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, so she should not be affected by outsiders.</p><p>However, when the sickly young master looked over, she still felt her heart tremble. She subconsciously turned away and did not dare to look at him.</p><p>So handsome!</p><p>However, being handsome was only secondary!</p><p>This sickly young master seemed to have some kind of magical power. His temperament was like a deep abyss. It was also like a star pond that sucked people’s minds away… Creation was so unfair. How could it create such a peerless face?</p><p>“I…” After she paused for half an aura, Ah Yao regained her senses and found the words she wanted to say just now.</p><p>She still didn’t dare to look at the sickly young master. She only turned around and said gently, “Qiao’er, bring me some wine.”</p><p>“Miss Ah Yao, you can’t…”</p><p>“Bring the wine!”</p><p>Qiao’er stomped her feet anxiously. In the end, she had no choice and could only turn around to get the wine pot.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, I will drink three cups as a punishment to express my apology.” Miss Ah Yao raised her wine cup and looked over with a gentle gaze. She had not even drunk any wine yet, but her cheeks were already slightly flushed.</p><p>The people around her immediately became anxious.</p><p>“Miss Ah Yao, you can’t!”</p><p>Who among them didn’t know that one of Miss Ah Yao’s rules was that she did not drink?</p><p>In the past, it was already a blessing to be able to see Miss Ah Yao and hear a piece of her immortal music when one came to the Yougui Pavilion.</p><p>Now, in order to apologize, not only did Miss Ah Yao break the rules, but she even wanted to down three cups in a row.</p><p>She was a mortal, and this wine was not an ordinary wine. Moreover, Miss Ah Yao was not good at drinking…</p><p>However, regardless of all the advice, in an attempt to cover her shame, Ah Yao drank the wine.</p><p>She downed three cups in a row. When she let down her sleeves, her cheeks had turned pink, and she was already unsteady on her feet.</p><p>The sick young master sneered slightly as he quietly watched Ah Yao’s performance.</p><p>Although he was surprised by her appearance, he would not let the Yogui Pavilion off. These were two different things.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was the first person who didn’t believe that the woman in the Exotic Pavilion didn’t know how to drink. He even doubted if Ah Yao was really a mortal.</p><p>Ah Yao was truly unable to stand steadily, and Qiao’er had to help her up.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, please.” She stretched out her hand and pointed at the pavilion upstairs.</p><p>“Humph!” Only then did the sickly young master close his paper fan with a snort. He no longer made things difficult for her and walked away. “Miss Ah Yao, let me help you up.” Qiao’er came over to help her.</p><p>“No need.” Ah Yao shook her head. “I can manage.”</p><p>She turned around and found a fair hand in front of her. The skin was as soft as snow, and the fingers were as slender as jade. Even the green veins on the back of the hand were beautiful.</p><p>Ah Yao was stunned. When she realized whose hand it was, her ears began to heat up.</p><p>However, she could no longer refuse. She reached out and gently placed her hand on it and murmured in a low voice.</p><p>“Thank you…”</p><p>Qiao’er couldn’t follow them because Aunt Xiang had instructed her to let Xu Gusheng go upstairs alone.</p><p>She chose to help because if she didn’t, she might really fall.</p><p>If she fell down the stairs later and injured herself, then the Yougui Pavilion would be the laughing stock in the entire Jade Capital City.</p><p>“Miss Ah Yao! No!”</p><p>“Xu Gusheng! You bastard! Let go of Miss Ah Yao. I’ll fight it out with you!” The crowd behind them was excited.</p><p>Not to mention holding hands, even if there was any Saint who came down the mountain to enjoy the music, there would be a screen between him and Miss Ah Yao. He could only admire her silhouette.</p><p>Who was as lucky as Xu Gusheng that Miss Ah Yao took the initiative to hold his hand?</p><p>“+(Glared At, Passive Points,+) +798.”</p><p>“+(Resented. Passive Points + ) +656.”</p><p>The sick young master’s hand was grasped, and he appeared stunned.</p><p>But soon, he turned his head to look at the woman beside him, who lowered her head in embarrassment and seemed about to bury her head in her chest. He said with a smile.</p><p>“Miss Ah Yao, you must have misunderstood something?”</p><p>“I was born with a delicate constitution, and I need someone to help me up. I’m not here to help you.”</p><p>As he spoke, he raised the paper fan in his left hand and lifted Ah Yao’s hand, which had suddenly stiffened.</p><p>His right hand naturally reached out and held it gently.</p><p>“You…” At this moment, Ah Yao sobered up a little. She looked up, her picturesque eyes filled with shock.</p><p>What was this?</p><p>In a flash, Ah Yao almost collapsed to the ground.</p><p>“+(Stunned, Passive Points), +1.”</p><p>“You!”</p><p>“You! You!”</p><p>“What’s wrong with me?”</p><p>“I…” When Miss Ah Yao saw that he was still so nonchalant, her delicate body trembled. She panted heavily, and her chest heaved up and down rapidly.</p><p>In the end, she didn’t say anything. She leaned her body against the railing of the stairs and held the pipa in her hand. She raised her left hand to support the extremely delicate, sickly young master. She was flustered.</p><p>“Please!”</p><p>She gnashed her teeth, and the moment of temptation disappeared.</p><p>“Please.”</p><p>The sickly young master raised his fan elegantly.</p><p>“Bastard… ”</p><p>The people behind them wailed and screamed, but they were stopped by the members of the Ghost God gang and could not attack.</p><p>“Walk slowly. Are you in a hurry to reincarnate?” The two figures disappeared from the round steps, but the sickly young master’s scolding never stopped.</p><p>“Alright, Ah Yao knows that Young Master is delicate!” Miss Ah Yao gritted her teeth and apologized.</p><p>“You’re a bisexual?”</p><p>“I’m sorry, Young Master Xu…” This time, her voice sounded terrified.</p><p>“Woah, beast!”</p><p>“You bastard Xu! You’re really going to die a horrible death!”</p><p>“+(Cursed, Passive Points +) +667..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
