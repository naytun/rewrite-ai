She was up to some mischief and no one could stop her.</p><p>“Isn’t one’s life event also considered a serious matter?”</p><p>Aunt Xiang sat back down in her chair with a bored expression. She then leaned over, her peach blossom eyes twinkled and with a smile, said.</p><p>“You really do not want to consider it?”</p><p>“Miss Ah Yao is very good. I don’t know how many people outside want to pursue her!”</p><p>As Aunt Xiang spoke, her hands drew beautiful arcs in the air.</p><p>“It’s like this.”</p><p>“The little girl has grown up. She’s beautiful and has a good figure. She has all the curves in the right places and is soft and pliant…”</p><p>“Stop!” Xu Xiaoshou gasped.</p><p>“Oh? Are you worried about something else?” Aunty Xiang tapped her red lips with her finger. Her eyes were filled with surprise, and then she thought of something.</p><p>“Don’t worry, little guy.”</p><p>“Ah Yao is still a virgin. The top lady of my Yougui Pavilion doesn’t do that kind of thing. You have to keep vour puritv in order to earn more.”</p><p>“She usually plays music and practices the piano. She’s soft and fragile and is a shy person. It’s so fun! I have been teasing her ever since I came back here!”</p><p>“I won’t think about this for the time being…” Xu Xiaoshou interrupted with difficulty.</p><p>“It’s okay. Let’s just leave it as is for now. We can consider it in the future.” Aunt Xiang arched her eyebrows.</p><p>“+(Hint received, Passive Points),+l.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. He had no choice but to change the topic. “Bazhun’an asked me to come over. It’s…”</p><p>“Oh? Could it be that you already have someone in your heart?” Aunt Xiang covered her mouth. “Tell me, quick, which family is she from? I’ll help you to check her out.”</p><p>“No? It’s okay if you don’t like Ah Yao. She’s indeed a little ordinary. She doesn’t have any cultivation level. She’s really not worthy of you! However, there are still many girls suitable for you in the Yougui Pavilion and the Xiang Clan. You can take your time to choose in the future.”</p><p>“Alright, alright. I won’t tease you anymore. Put down the fan and speak!” Aunt Xiang saw that the sickly young master had clamped his mouth and finally gave the matter a rest.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he could breathe again. He put down the fan that covered his face and inhaled deeply.</p><p>“Humph! That Ba is too lazy for words!. Since he told me, he definitely didn’t give you all the details. Let me tell you the whole story.”</p><p>After she poured herself a glass of wine, Aunt Xiang paused and realized something. She raised her glass and handed it over. “Why don’t, uh… Or do you want to tell me first?”</p><p>“Go ahead.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed.</p><p>He really didn’t know anything.</p><p>Bazhun’an only asked him to go to the Yougui Pavilion. He didn’t give him any specific mission or instructions.</p><p>Even the ‘peerless genius’ who was his gift to me was so well hidden that he probably had to get some clues from Aunt Xiang.</p><p>What did he mean when he said they would have a discussion after he became the second-in-command saint servant… Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had been too impulsive at that time. He was addressed as Lord Shou and was so overwhelmed that he lost his bearings. He regretted his actions now. “Then I won’t stand on ceremony with you. Let me tell you.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang downed the wine in one gulp. When they got down to business matters, her expression became more serious.</p><p>“First of all, due to various reasons, the time limit for the Central Region Holy Palace Trial had not been set yet. However, according to the internal intelligence I obtained, it would likely be held in 13 days.”</p><p>So precise?</p><p>“Is your information reliable?” Xu Xiaoshou hesitated.</p><p>“You’re doubting me?” Aunt Xiang rolled her eyes and stood up with her hands on her hips. She said aggressively.</p><p>“Ever since your master, Fen Qin, disappeared, it had been difficult to reach out to the Half-Moon Residence. The Central Region is where our deepest foundation is at.’</p><p>“How dare you question me?”</p><p>“Even if I just came out, do you think that I ran this Yougui Pavilion for nothing?”</p><p>Uh… Xu Xioshou cowered back, startled by her tigress-like aura.</p><p>He didn’t care about Aunt Xiang’s tone, but his attention was drawn to something else.</p><p>Fen Qin?</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not ask any more questions and quickly returned to the main topic. “Aunt Xiang is wise indeed and I am the one who’s ignorant. Then where exactly would the Holy Palace Trial be held?”</p><p>“Four Symbols Secret Realm.” Aunt Xiang’s anger subsided as quickly as it had flared. Now her brows were furrowed and she looked worried.</p><p>Would it really be here?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou subconsciously wanted to question her again, but this time, he had learnt his lesson and switched the topic.</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao must have gotten most of the information on Abyss Island.”</p><p>“Bazhun’an kept an eye on the Ran Ming ruins. I also have the God-slaying token. It’s impossible that they don’t know.” “Are these ruins in the Four Symbols Secret Realm?”</p><p>“Yes.” Aunt Xiang nodded.</p><p>“Then they still dared to hold the Holy Palace Trial in the Four Symbols Secret Realm?”</p><p>Aunt Xiang was amused and said.</p><p>“Kid, first of all, you have to know that you are the rat that crossed the street.</p><p>They are the owners of the continent. You should be the one to be afraid!”</p><p>“Secondly, the Holy Palace belongs to the Holy Palace, and the Holy Divine Palace belongs to the Holy Divine Palace. These two are on equal footing and would not invade each other. Elder Dao the Flamboyant had no right to interfere with the decision of the Holy Palace on the trial location.”</p><p>“However, they are indeed united in their hatred for a common enemy, so they must have communicated with each other in advance.”</p><p>“In the end, they even chose the Four Symbols Secret Realm. You should think about the profound meaning behind this.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang paused for a moment and rolled her eyes. She knew why the young man in front of her asked this question. She asked indirectly,</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, the Saint Servant won the battle on Abyss Island. The Holy Divine Palace lost everything.”</p><p>“But from their point of view, it was just a small mistake after the past thousands of years. It was harmless.</p><p>“The enemy spent a hundred years to plan this in exchange for a victory. Our side was careless and did not prepare anything in advance.. Did we deserve to lose? Yes we did!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
