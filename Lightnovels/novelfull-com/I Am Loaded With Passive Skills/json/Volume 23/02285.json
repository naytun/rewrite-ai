He even consciously blocked it.</p><p>He was a person who respected human rights.</p><p>Unless the second true body had done something that violated the bottom line of morality or was in danger, he would not be distracted and pay any attention to it.</p><p>Otherwise, he trusted the second true body and it also meant that he could take care of everything.</p><p>He even named him Jin Ren. This showed that Xu Xiaoshou had done his best to treat him as if he was human…</p><p>Although he felt that after this surge of points, the gap between them would be huge. Jin Ren would not be able to live for long.</p><p>“See for yourself.”</p><p>The second true body didn’t need to say much. It transmitted everything that he had discovered to the main body through the Apricot Realm in a single thought.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw Li Fuyu who waited downstairs through Jin Ren’s Perception at a glance. He even recalled the conversation that took place between this woman and the staff at the Yougui Pavilion.</p><p>When they entered the city, Xu Xiaoshou was only surprised that Li Fuyu had killed the city guard with her jade sword as he drove by in the osmanthus carriage.</p><p>Now, he clearly knew the background of this woman!</p><p>Li Fuyu, Sword Tower, one of the new Seven Sword Deity.</p><p>This time, the Seven Sword Deity were ranked. She was currently ranked fourth, just below Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>“I am ranked behind her, at the bottom of the listing of Seven Sword Deity, so I can basically rule out the possibility that she came to fight me for the sake of fame.</p><p>“Moreover, this woman is so dumb. She doesn’t seem to understand the ways of the world. The staff said to wait, and she really waited. She even wanted to wait outside the brothel until tomorrow?”</p><p>“She’s so polite that she’s like a different person from the one who killed people outside the city!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought hard and finally came up with a phrase that suited Li Fuyu very well.</p><p>Sword Maniac.</p><p>Other than the sword, she was an idiot in every other aspect. Who else could</p><p>the form be if not Li Fuyu?</p><p>“Generally speaking, such people have terrifying strength. Even if they were weaker than Big Mouth Xiao, the difference would not be much.”</p><p>“Big Mouth Xiao was in the first realm and was able to challenge Hua Lai. He can even combine the realms. His proficiency is even more ridiculous than my cheating ways. ”</p><p>“After he exited the second realm, he went to sleep as if nothing happened. He’s clearly only an ancient swordsman. He is not like me, whose passive skills are not unlimited. He’s simply far from the norm!”</p><p>“If it were Li Fuyu, if she was an explosive seed… Hmm, what kind of sword was that on her waist? It didn’t look like a famed sword either? Previously, I heard it was called ‘Protect’. Was that the name of the sword skill or the name of the sword? An explosive seed that is part of the Heavenly Unravel?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that it was a big possibility!</p><p>It would be unbelievable to say that this kind of Sword Maniac did not have a deep relationship with the sword!</p><p>The spiritual quality of the snow-white sword at her waist was not weak and did not seem like an ordinary sword. Its quality was even higher than Hidden Bitter’s, who had just broken through.</p><p>It was likely that far from being a famed sword, only Li Fuyu was a universally renowned name.</p><p>However, that was not the main point. The main point was the question Xu Xiaoshou had when he was in the osmanthus carriage.</p><p>“Xu Gusheng and even Xu Xiaoshou shouldn’t have been exposed at this stage, let alone being seen through by this stupid woman.”</p><p>“Since it’s impossible, how did she manage to track me down so precisely?”</p><p>“Sword Maniac…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have realized something. He felt that Li Fuyu was probably not looking for a definite person.</p><p>It was even possible that she had an acute sense of smell and came here after she caught a whiff of the ancient swordsman.</p><p>After all, he had the the Holy Emperor Lv.0 Sword Technique Expertise. Even if Xu Xiaoshou did not practice much, he was acclaimed as the third most talented Way of the Sword swordsman in the world. No one would dare to claim to be second.</p><p>He had full confidence in himself.</p><p>For a sword maniac like Li Fuyu to find a Way of the Sword genius to accept the inheritance of the Sword God or even the inheritance of the sword tower’s Sword Human who might or might not be reliable…</p><p>Yes, it was very possible!</p><p>“She looks dumb and and easy to fool. Maybe I can kidnap her and place her in the First Pavilion in the sky from the broken sword tower.” Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his chin and quickly shifted his attention from this woman.</p><p>She had to wait for a day. Let’s see what she would do after a day!</p><p>After all, by then, he should have finished his points accumulation and would have secretly left the Yougui Pavilion.</p><p>What the second true body referred to was the private room on the opposite side of the third floor of the Yougui Pavilion.</p><p>He sensed a familiar aura, but he couldn’t remember who it belonged to.</p><p>However, as soon as that fellow entered, the abnormal spatial fluctuations caused by the evolution of the Yuan Mansion world into the Apricot Realm were completely erased.</p><p>This was something that even Xu Xiaoshou, if he did not have the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff in hand, could do.</p><p>“Time Ancestor Shadow Staff…</p><p>At the thought of this, Xu Xiaoshou and his second true body understood something at the same time.</p><p>Without too much consideration, his second true body activated the Art of Spiritual Array Disc and broke the spiritual array in the private room across from the room.</p><p>Then, he and Xu Xiaoshou, who was in the Apricot Realm, were stunned at the same time.</p><p>Aunt Xiang!</p><p>Kong Yuhen!</p><p>How did this pair of enemies, who were rumored to have had a ‘life and death friendship’ in the War of the Ten High Nobles of the previous era, meet?</p><p>Wait, what did Aunt Xiang do?</p><p>Summoning spell?</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Before Kong Yuhen could say anything, a virtual image appeared behind the woman who was in a state of panic.</p><p>It was a burly bald man with a face that seemed to be set in stone. He was bare-chested and his muscles bulged.</p><p>It was clearly just a one-to-one virtual image, but it was extremely real. Moreover, it felt as if he had been magnified several times after he came out.</p><p>Aunt Xiang was in front.</p><p>The virtual image of this bald phantom was behind her. This combination was like that of a beauty and a beast..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
