(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“There’s no need!”</p><p>Water Ghost didn’t even need to listen to it to guess what Xu Xiaoshou’s devious thoughts were.</p><p>He didn’t have the habit to join or work hard for anyone.</p><p>He was only a Saint Servant in name, so why would he give up Bazhun’an and choose Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>“It’s up to me if I want to tell you and it’s up to you whether you listen or not.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was obviously unmoved. “Let’s work together.” He said. “The First Pavilion in the Sky and your people. You don’t have to listen to him anymore.” Xu Xiaoshou glanced at Bazhun’an.</p><p>The latter’s expression was calm and did not show even a trace of surprise. It was obvious that he had long expected someone to speak in such an arrogant manner.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong and Zhu Yike had already come over.</p><p>Even Mei Siren took the initiative to come closer so he could listen to their conversation. He was moved by this straightforward statement.</p><p>It was too direct.</p><p>He did not even pretend to be tactful.</p><p>Once his wings gained strength, would he choose to establish his own sect?</p><p>Zhu Yike’s eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong frowned, his mind was elsewhere.</p><p>Mei Siren was indifferent. His existence was the best lubricant to ensure that the Saint Servant and the First Pavilion in the Sky would not dare to break.</p><p>“Such blatant poaching?”</p><p>Water Ghost was amused. He waited for a while and when he saw that Bazhun’an did not say anything, he said.</p><p>“Even if I quit the Saint Servant now, I’ll still be one in the eyes of the outside world. After this battle, there would be no difference between the Saint Servant and myself.”</p><p>“So, even if I leave, I will still have some contact with you in the future. As for your so-called First Pavilion in the Sky, is there anything that can draw my attention</p><p>“Yes!” Xu Xiaoshou nodded. “Your Crystal Palace is still with me!”</p><p>Water Ghost’s expression changed immediately and turned gloomy.</p><p>He remembered the pain when his body suffered multiple explosions. Xu Xiaoshou had taken advantage of his ignorance and now he still dared to mention it?</p><p>“+(Glared At, Passive Points,+)+l.”</p><p>“Hehe, I was just joking… You see, if he did not object, it would mean that he acquiesced.” Xu Xiaoshou pointed at Bazhun’an, who had a vague expression on his face.</p><p>“What do you think?” Water Ghost also looked over.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t give Bazhun’an a chance to speak.</p><p>“He said that he wouldn’t restrict my freedom. He said that I can leave at any time. This is the best time.”</p><p>“The First Pavilion in the Sky is a partner of the Saint Servant. It is independent and can provide a lot of help.”</p><p>“For example, do you understand the power of cooperation?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gestured. When he saw how the expressions of these two devious people had turned playful, he sighed and declined to explain. He went straight to the point.</p><p>“I’ll be able to win over Xu Yue Gray Palace’s war faction and form an alliance soon, so it’s not impossible to befriend the conservative faction. Greedy the Cat Spirit is in my hands.”</p><p>He grabbed hold of a little fat cat.</p><p>Lei Xi’er glared at him in dissatisfaction. He would even use Greedy the Cat Spirit?</p><p>However, it clearly worked.</p><p>As soon as he said this, Water Ghost and Bazhun’an looked at each other.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already hooked up with the Xu Yue Gray Palace’s war faction?</p><p>Bazhun’an had secretly pushed for the unification of the dark faction of the Southern Region and the Eastern Region. He wanted to start with Palace Master Bai Zhou to form what Xu Xiaoshou called an alliance.</p><p>For this reason, the Half-Moon Residence had helped the Xu Yue Gray Palace a lot, and they had used up almost all of their inventory.</p><p>However, Palace Master Bai Zhou was temperamental and would never give any confirmation.</p><p>Bazhun’an knew that he and the Saint Servant were both powerful. Everyone was afraid of being used as a weapon, so he understood Bai Zhou’s choice. Therefore, he was about to give up and began to plan for the ‘hard push’.</p><p>However, if it was the First Pavilion in the Sky…</p><p>Almost all of the people present were smart, and most of them quickly understood the implication of Xu Xiaoshou’s words.</p><p>“Other than that, in terms of the elites’ combat strength, I still have my dear Teacher.” Xu Xiaoshou added more weight to his words as he included Mei Siren.</p><p>Mei Siren turned around and struggled mentally. Then, he saw his good disciple’s eyes sparkle as he said.</p><p>“Teacher, I learned from you! The Wisdom is Emptiness that slays Saints with one move, isn’t it a marvel?”</p><p>The old sword saint couldn’t hold it in any longer.</p><p>He had held back for a long time and hadn’t talked about it.</p><p>He had just wiped out Number Two’s saint will with a single strike on Abyss Island, and Xu Xiaoshou had used this move to kill Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>As a Teacher, how could he not be proud of his student’s progress?</p><p>Everyone looked over with respect.</p><p>Mei Siren cleared his throat, raised his head slightly, and flapped his sleeves calmly. He maintained his silence and only waved the paper fan in his hand.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes moved down in unison.</p><p>“Well said, well said.”</p><p>It was too cute… Xu Xiaoshou took the opportunity and shook his teacher’s arm.</p><p>“But there are still a lot of sword techniques that I haven’t learned. I have to ask you for more advice. Can you stay in the First Pavilion in the Sky?”</p><p>The smile on Mei Siren’s face froze, and his hand stopped moving.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grabbed it with both hands. The grip was so strong that Mei Siren’s hand couldn’t even move, let alone wave the fan.</p><p>He looked down at the fan in surprise and was overjoyed. “Teacher, you agreed? That’s great. Finally, someone made a decision for me.”</p><p>Mei Siren opened his mouth but didn’t say anything.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression changed as rapidly as if he had flipped a book. He sighed in grief and wiped away the sticky and disgusting transparent liquid that he had squeezed out with his Transformation.</p><p>“When I think of how many obstacles I faced on my journey…”</p><p>“I walked out of the Spirit Palace and was trapped in the White Cave. When I came back to the Eighth Palace, I had to rely on Elder Sang to protect me in order for me to survive.</p><p>“I survived, but he entered the Dead Sea!”</p><p>“Wow! That hurts! A child without a teacher is like grass. I was made use of from the Yunlun Mountain Range to Abyss Island, but I didn’t dare to resist….”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
