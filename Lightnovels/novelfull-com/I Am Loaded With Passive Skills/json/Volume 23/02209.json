(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Bazhun’an’s lips twitched.</p><p>“Good, good!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grabbed Mei Siren’s arm and rubbed it twice.</p><p>“That’s great!”</p><p>“Fortunately, I met you. Now, I have someone who can help me make decisions and avenge me!”</p><p>Everyone was speechless.</p><p>“+(Despised. Passive Points,+)+4.” “+(Cursed, Passive Points +)+1.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er turned her head to the side.</p><p>“Ha, to think I have a pair of God Devil Eyes, but I can’t bear to see this!”</p><p>Her ears turned red as she listened. She didn’t know how Xu Xiaoshou had the audacity to say such things.</p><p>Mei Siren was the only one who paid attention. He shook his head and sighed. “You’ve indeed suffered a lot.</p><p>“So you really agree not to leave?” Xu Xiaoshou was too direct. He knew that he would be touched by his acting skills. Which smart person present could not see it?</p><p>“I agree.” Mei Siren smiled and tapped Xu Xiaoshou on the head with his fan.</p><p>He did not indulge him, but he had his own considerations.</p><p>Since he was already in the game, to help anyone was considered as having helped.</p><p>The positions of the Saint Servants were filled, and the system was already formed.</p><p>As an old senior, he wouldn’t be able to blend in with the young people. On the contrary, it would be very awkward.</p><p>What would his rank be?</p><p>He, Mei Siren, wouldn’t pay attention and think about these things, but there would always be people who would do that.</p><p>Mei Siren had long understood the consequences if he joined the Saint Servant.</p><p>It was impossible for him to take the position of Chief, and he would be ranked second. He could not summon the Saint Servant.</p><p>From the looks of it, the best place to be a founding elder was in the First Pavilion in the Sky. Of course, the prerequisite was that the First Pavilion in the Sky could really become independent.</p><p>“Look! These are my people!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up when he received a positive response. He paused for a moment and shouted, “Elder Han!”</p><p>An ear-piercing cry rang out by the White Tiger gate.</p><p>Elder Han, who had already shrunk into a palm-sized fat ferret, wagged its fluffy tail and used the Super Saint Escape Technique. It did not dare to delay for even half a second before it rushed over.</p><p>“Hey! ”</p><p>“Lord Shou, just call me Xiao Han!”</p><p>“Greetings to Lord Bazhun’an, Master Siren, Senior Water Ghost, to be able to meet these, these seniors…</p><p>Even Xiao Kongtong and Zhu Yike were higher voids.</p><p>To be able to stand next to Lord Bazhun’an and speak, Elder Han felt that it was a generation weaker than them.</p><p>It was used to being humble.</p><p>Now, it trembled and awaited its orders.</p><p>“Come here.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er saw that the demi-saint white ferret trembled in fear, and she waved her hand.</p><p>Elder Han felt as if it had been granted amnesty. It jumped and landed on the little senior’s palm. Only then did it feel relieved.</p><p>In terms of status, this person was the highest!</p><p>Who hadn’t seen the scene where she and Lord Shou had held hands and stood in the sky like a celestial couple?</p><p>“Ahem, this person is also a demi-saint…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt embarrassed to introduce Elder Han when he saw how humble it was. However, he reacted quickly.</p><p>“There’s something.”</p><p>“What is it?” Elder Han was stunned.</p><p>“Corner of Divine Prison.</p><p>Elder Han hurriedly took out the item.</p><p>The Holy Emperor’s power had already faded from its body, but it was all absorbed into the Divine Prison Lord Qing Shi and had not flown away.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grabbed the Corner of Divine Prison and showed it to everyone.</p><p>“Xiaohan was a gift from the Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison.”</p><p>“The Five Decays of Heaven and Man, do you still remember your promise that you made in the First Hall of Sins?” He asked as he looked in the direction of the Vermilion Bird sect.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird sect’s blood-red sky had long since faded after the power of the Four Divine Pillars disappeared. Of course, its power would not be lost.</p><p>Who on the Inner Island would give up and stay behind and really return to their nest?</p><p>All the power of the Seven Trees Emperor had been injected into the Blood World Pearl!</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was still on his deathbed.</p><p>The Blood World Pearl, which had replaced his semi-saint person, jumped out of his head and turned scarlet.</p><p>Under the mask, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man opened his eyes.</p><p>“Calculative…”</p><p>“Naturally!”</p><p>He actually made two sounds. One was from the weakened Five Decays of</p><p>Heaven and Man himself, and the other came from the Seven Trees Emperor.</p><p>“Yama even cooperated with me as well. The Five Decays of Heaven and Man is my most loyal ally, and so is the Seven Trees Emperor.” Xu Xiaoshou said indifferently and turned to look at the Green Dragon Gate.</p><p>“Precious Dragon…”</p><p>This time, even before he finished talking.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>At the Green Dragon Gate, with the disappearance of the Four Divine Pillars, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon could no longer hold on to its power for long.</p><p>It directly turned into a beam of light, flew over, and entered Xu Xiaoshou’s Holy Emperor Dragon Scale.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, remember our agreement. I will wait for you on the Inner Island. ”</p><p>Was the relationship between the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon and Xu Xiaoshou already that good?</p><p>When he heard how the Master of the Black Vein encouraged Xu Xiaoshou, even Bazhun’an looked surprised.</p><p>He knew how arrogant the black dragon was.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had successfully convinced it in this round, so it was willing to place its bet on him.</p><p>“+(Watched, Passive Points+)+8.”</p><p>After he felt the admiring gazes of so many people around him, Xu Xiaoshou laughed heartily and suddenly activated the Exploding Posture.</p><p>Golden spots bloomed everywhere.</p><p>That faint sense of threat frightened everyone, and they all retreated.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou spread the wings on his back. One was ice, and the other was fire. He said proudly.</p><p>“The Saint Servant is dead. The Heavenly Tower should be established!”</p><p>“My wings have already grown. I should establish my own sect and be the king… Bazhun’an, do you have any objections?”</p><p>Bazhun’an’s eyelids twitched as he looked at the young man who suddenly acted up, and his toes curled involuntarily.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked around and soon turned his gaze toward Water Ghost.</p><p>“Water Ghost, I’ll give you one more chance.. Do you want to join as my Saint Servant?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
