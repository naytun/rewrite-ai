(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“Let’s return to the matter at hand!”</p><p>“Heavenly Ancestor Legacy, I don’t know exactly how many people have obtained it, but I know three of them.’</p><p>“But without any surprises, everyone’s progress should be similar to mine, stuck at a certain step.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately thought of the three major steps of the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy:</p><p>“One, obtain the Heavenly Ancestor’s Blessing.”</p><p>“Two, save the Void Clan.”</p><p>“Three, obtain the approval of the former Abyss Island Spirit to unseal the</p><p>‘Heavenly Ancestor’s Blessing’ and obtain the ‘Heavenly Ancestor Legacy.”‘ He was currently stuck at the second step, clueless about how to rescue the</p><p>Void Clan and unaware of the fate of its remaining members.</p><p>Moreover, Abyss Island had almost been devastated by this battle.</p><p>Let alone saving it!</p><p>This could be considered extreme destruction!</p><p>The Heavenly Ancestor Legacy seemed unlikely.</p><p>“Bazhun’an’s progress should be similar to mine, and Bei Huai should be about the same…”</p><p>“So many years have passed, and they haven’t succeeded. It’s normal for me not to succeed either.”</p><p>“If the Holy Emperor can’t do it, neither can I. I’m no different from the Holy Emperor…” Xu Xiaoshou accepted reality with a clear conscience. “What does Mr. Bazhun’an mean?” Kong Yuhen was puzzled. “Do you have the inheritance?” Bazhun’an asked directly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was startled.</p><p>Indeed, Kong Yuhen was very powerful.</p><p>Perhaps he also obtained the Heavenly Ancestor’s Blessing from somewhere and embarked on the path of inheritance?</p><p>“No,” Kong Yuhen shook his head.</p><p>“Then I’m relieved…” Bazhun’an didn’t doubt him, “There’s something that may require your help.”</p><p>“Is this what you suggested giving a shot?”</p><p>“Sort of.’</p><p>“Mr. Bazhun’an, please go ahead.”</p><p>Kong Yuhen did not immediately agree. He was obviously not naive. Bazhun’an looked back at Xu Xiaoshou, ignoring past grievances, and said:</p><p>“I have no interest in the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy.”</p><p>“But having something belonging to someone else hanging in my mind for so long is unpleasant.”</p><p>“It’s better to accept this power and use it against enemies than to let it hang there. It just so happens that you are here.”</p><p>“You possess multiple paths, and the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy is very suitable for you.”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Xu Xiaoshou instinctively felt uncomfortable, even looking down to see if there was a pit beneath his feet.</p><p>“Heavenly Ancestor, it won’t turn out to be something evil, right?”</p><p>“Then you…”</p><p>“I am an ancient swordsman, and I really despise it.”</p><p>“Mainly…”</p><p>“This is a gift I prepared for you, a welcome gift after you become the second-in-command saint servant, and also the hard-earned hiring fee for</p><p>Abyss Island.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou giggled and felt it was acceptable after all.</p><p>“I see. I can give it a try, but how?”</p><p>Kong Yuhen was also mystified. Everyone looked at Bazhun’an, who stepped forward and said:</p><p>“After studying for a long time, I think I’ve figured it out.”</p><p>“The power of the Heavenly Ancestor nurtures both the Inner and Outer Islands of Abyss Island and is not controlled by external forces.”</p><p>“But now, the Inner Island has become the private prison of the Holy</p><p>Emperor’s aristocratic family, essentially invaded by external forces.”</p><p>“As long as the Inner Island does not return, saving the Void Clan is just wishful thinking.”</p><p>“But?” Xu Xiaoshou was hopeful.</p><p>“There is indeed a but… this is a roundabout way, and we have already completed most of it,” Bazhun’an said.</p><p>“What way?</p><p>“Destroy and then establish!”</p><p>These words were sonorous and made everyone ponder.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned, looked at the devastated Outer Island of Abyss Island, and then at Kong Yuhen, who needed a “try”…</p><p>Before Bazhun’an could explain, he already felt incredulous.</p><p>“Are you going to say that you want to blow up Abyss Island, then use time reversal to ‘save’ the Void Clan in a ’roundabout’ way?” Xu Xiaoshou widened his eyes. This was too unrealistic!</p><p>“You’re very smart.”</p><p>“This is deceit! Would the Abyss Island Spirit be deceived by you?”</p><p>“Destruction has become an established fact, an irreversible outcome, and it is what the Spirit of the Heavenly Ancestor should bear for straddling on the fence,” Bazhun’an’s expression turned slightly cold, “Since it dares to hide and conceal, it should know that it will lead to the current situation. I’m just going with the flow and simply moving forward a specific point in time.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou listened in shock.</p><p>This was not deception; it was a blatant threat!</p><p>—Threatening the Spirit of the Heavenly Ancestor?</p><p>Before this, Xu Xiaoshou had never even thought about it!</p><p>He had been focused on how to complete the mission of the inheritance, and if he couldn’t, so be it.</p><p>But Bazhun’an…</p><p>“Bazhun’an, who stood one foot higher than the sky…!”</p><p>A jolt of shock ran through each person as the words flashed in their minds.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou fully understood why some people said that the</p><p>Eighth Sword Deity had gone ‘mad.’</p><p>The man’s thinking was never grounded; he soared high into the clouds, fundamentally ‘mad.’</p><p>“But even if this succeeds, it’s just a roundabout way to save the Void Clan on the Outer Island, and the Inner Island is still missing…” Xu Xiaoshou hesitated. Upon careful consideration, threatening the Spirit of the Heavenly Ancestor seemed feasible; the other party wouldn’t counterattack.</p><p>He didn’t think of it; his vision was too limited. He thought the level of the “Heavenly Ancestor” was too high.</p><p>Although it was indeed high…</p><p>But with someone like Bazhun’an, who was unbridled and influential, Xu Xiaoshou felt that the Tenth Ancestor was just a realm, not an insurmountable existence.</p><p>Naturally, the plan was worth a try.</p><p>“Yes, that’s why I will give it one last chance.”</p><p>“While you are saving the Outer Island of Abyss Island, I will make a contract with a secondary plane door with my power to temporarily resist the influence of the Five Holy Emperor aristocratic families on the Inner Island.”</p><p>“Temporarily, this will form a relatively balanced state, equivalent to no invasion of an external force..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
