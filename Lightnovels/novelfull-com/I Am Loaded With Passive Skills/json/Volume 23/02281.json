Yu Zhiwen often got this answer when she faced people, things that she was powerless to do anything about.</p><p>Of course, on the Yunlun Mountain Range, she had gotten the same answer every time she calculated Xu Xiaoshou’s fate with her fingers.</p><p>“What did you get?” Dao Qiongcang suddenly turned toward her.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was stunned and subconsciously lowered her head. “I’m too weak.” “Then I am also very weak.” Dao Qiongcang smiled. “I won’t get anything either.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s mouth opened slightly, and her veil outlined the curve. However, she didn’t make a sound, but there was a stunned look in her starry eyes.</p><p>“Void.”</p><p>Dao Xuanji was clad in a Daoist robe and her long hair was tied up; her eyebrows were sparse and she had thin lips. Her eyes were devoid of any emotion and she held a horsetail whisk in her hand as she spoke softly.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang smiled. “Then, what does void mean?”</p><p>“It is a void, but you know something, so there’s no need to keep me in suspense. Tell me.” Dao Xuanji’s expression was emotionless.</p><p>If she couldn’t figure it out, could she figure out Dao Qiongcang’s interpretation of the concept of a void?</p><p>“Tsk.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang clicked his tongue and felt bored.</p><p>In the past, everyone in the Council of Ten was like a silly goose. When they saw the red glow on his divine Sinan, they would only say that the red color represented a bloody disaster and the gold color represented good luck.</p><p>It was indeed different now. There were a few more people who knew how to do calculations, and there were also more people who knew how to cause problems.</p><p>“Interesting, truly interesting…”</p><p>Before he could finish, Dao Xuanji’s eyebrows shot up and she glanced at Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s smile disappeared. He felt that it was really boring. He said indifferently. “It’s here.”</p><p>“What’s here?” For some reason, Yu Zhiwen’s heart skipped a beat as she asked. Dao Qiongcang turned to look at the little girl with a half-smile. “He’s… here.”</p><p>He?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen savored this word.</p><p>Dao Xuanji didn’t pay attention to this. She turned and said.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“You can’t predict what happened on Abyss Island. Now that he is your only variable, you can confirm his identity… When did he come?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen lowered her head, and there was a trace of helplessness in her eyes. She couldn’t even hear what her Supreme Master said.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang didn’t reply, as if what Dao Xuanji said was wrong.</p><p>“Did I guess wrong?”</p><p>“You only guessed half of it.”</p><p>“Oh, ‘he’ has another half? Then you should say ‘them’.”</p><p>“I told you.”</p><p>“You didn’t.”</p><p>“I…” Dao Qiongcang looked at this stubborn sister who liked to compete with him since their youth, but had been repeatedly frustrated and refused to admit defeat. He was momentarily speechless.</p><p>He suddenly laughed and shook his head. “You won’t understand even if I told you. You won’t believe me even if I explained. If we continue this conversation, you would not be convinced and would only say that I’m trying to argue. So don’t ask, and I won’t say it either. Let’s call a truce again.”</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s chest heaved violently, and she almost stood up.</p><p>However, when she saw from the corner of her eye that there were still so many people who watched them, she didn’t continue. It was to give this Hallmaster Dao some ‘face’.</p><p>“Did you see that?” Dao Qiongcang turned to Ai Cangsheng.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng’s eyes held a trace of mystery as he sat on the laurel wood wheelchair. Traces of the Great Path flowed from his eyes. He shook his head slightly. “I can’t see anything, but I’ve locked onto the general location. It’s near Changle Street in the Jade Capital City.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s fingers pointed toward the round table and he looked in the direction of the Chiefs of the six divisions.</p><p>“Xi, Nian, it’s your turn to take action.”</p><p>“Search Changle Street. Be careful not to be noticed… Well, deal with it like how you would deal with a demi-saint and focus on saving your lives.”</p><p>Demi-Saint?</p><p>The enemy was a demi-saint?</p><p>The Chiefs of the six divisions were all shocked.</p><p>However, when they thought of the name Xu Xiaoshou that had appeared before, they realized that it was not a demi-saint but more like… He was stronger than a demi-saint!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s veil fluttered, but she didn’t say anything.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked straight ahead. “The rest of you stay put. Don’t alert the enemy.”</p><p>“Yes, sir!” Everyone agreed in unison without any questions. Yu Zhiwen also swallowed what she was about to say.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is the Seven Sword Deity. We should send more people, or else…” Xi pondered for a moment and chose to speak.</p><p>This enemy was not easy to deal with. He had done his research.</p><p>Wherever this Saint Servant Lord Shou appeared, there would always be a huge storm around him.</p><p>Perhaps there was more than one demi-saint this time. If a Holy Emperor appeared, it would be a big deal.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang did not respond. He only looked at the young man and said calmly.</p><p>“Remember, you are now members of the Heavenly Group.”</p><p>“As long as you face a Saint Servant, you only need to follow orders unconditionally. There’s no need to raise any questions.”</p><p>“Otherwise, you guys can take this seat.”</p><p>The few people who stood nearby immediately fell silent out of fear.</p><p>Xi was shocked, and he vaguely understood something.</p><p>If he could think of it, would Hallmaster Dao not have thought of it already?</p><p>He had thought of it, but he still made such arrangements. It meant that he had another layer of thought that he was not aware of. How could he question, dare to question, and be worthy to question?</p><p>“Yes, sir!” Xi nodded earnestly.</p><p>“Go. Set off immediately. Be careful and stay hidden.” Dao Qiongcang waved his hand, and the two people below disappeared.</p><p>“Since it’s Xu Xiaoshou, they won’t be able to find anything. All the traces were wiped away just now. It must have been the work of a demi-saint. There’s someone behind him.” Ai Cangsheng saw Dao Qiongcang’s gaze and helplessly expressed his opinion.</p><p>“Yes, the location is on Changle Street. Of course, they would not find anything. ”</p><p>“Then you still sent them there?”</p><p>“As long as there isn’t, then there is.” Dao Qiongcang smiled. “Besides, there’s also the Yougui Pavilion on Changle Street.” Yougui Pavilion?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen discreetly remembered this name.</p><p>Li Fuyu traced the aura that was almost immersed in the sea of mortality and arrived in front of this antique inn.</p><p>She stopped in her tracks, looked up and saw the plaque that read ‘Yougui Pavilion’.</p><p>There was no one at the door. There was a hole in the wall that was being repaired.</p><p>The aura had been cut off.</p><p>Outsiders couldn’t sense the abnormality of the spatial fluctuations, but Li Fuyu was deep in thought as she held the sword at her waist.</p><p>She stepped out and was about to enter the pavilion.</p><p>“Miss, we are not receiving any guests today. There’s been an incident in the pavilion, and we’re currently addressing it.” A beauty came out of the door. She sized up Li Fuyu, who was dressed in a familiar swordsman’s outfit, and she was quite curious.</p><p>Their pavilion attracted such attention.</p><p>However, there were very few people who went on the streets to show off to the public, or rather, they were ashamed to.</p><p>“You…” Li Fuyu only glanced briefly and turned her head away. Her cheeks were slightly red. “Your clothes are askew.”</p><p>The beauty lowered her head and saw that a large portion of her snow-white chest was exposed. She immediately covered her mouth and smiled.</p><p>She could tell at a glance that this woman dressed as a swordsman had probably stumbled onto a wrong place and was not in the same line as them.</p><p>“Young lady, this is how it works here.”</p><p>“I want to go in.”</p><p>“Tomorrow? We had a slight problem at the pavilion today.” The beauty pointed at the hole in the wall again.</p><p>“Tomorrow…” Li Fuyu sensed the sword cognition from the wall and nodded slightly. “Alright.”</p><p>The area in front of the Yougui Pavilion quickly fell silent.</p><p>The beauty looked at the graceful swordsman who did not leave. She just held her sword and stayed in front of the pavilion and she seemed lost in thought.</p><p>“Miss, aren’t you going home?” She asked.</p><p>“I’ll wait.”</p><p>“What are you waiting for?”</p><p>“Tomorrow.”</p><p>… You’ll wait here?” “Yes.”</p><p>What a strange woman!</p><p>The beauty exclaimed, but it was indeed not appropriate to ask her to leave directly, so she turned around and entered the pavilion and intended to ask</p><p>Aunt Xiang.</p><p>On the third floor of the Yougui Pavilion.</p><p>The teacup in Xiang Yaoyao’s hand suddenly disappeared.</p><p>She turned around and noticed a huge spatial fluctuation in the private room opposite her.</p><p>However, in an instant, this fluctuation disappeared again, as if it had been erased by someone.</p><p>What had he done?</p><p>What did Xu Xiaoshou do?</p><p>With such a huge commotion, was he trying to court death? What if Dao Qioncang found out…</p><p>Xiang Yaoyao’s thoughts froze as she looked at the person who had appeared in the room. Her eyes narrowed and a look of horror flashed across her pretty face.</p><p>“Friend, don’t panic. I’m just passing by.”</p><p>The scholar glanced at the beauty by the window who looked as if she had met a demon. He was slightly taken aback. His face couldn’t be so terrifying, right?</p><p>He had only sensed the power of the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff, so he had come over to take a look and help Xu Xiaoshou to erase his traces.</p><p>Why was this person so surprised?</p><p>She knows who I am?</p><p>Who would have thought that before he could ask, the black-dressed woman in front of him did not say anything and instead hurriedly released her spiritual source and ruthlessly slapped it on the windowsill.</p><p>“Summoning Spell!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
