She lowered her head and did not dare to ask any more questions. “Qiao’er understands.”</p><p>“It’s good that you understand.” Aunt Xiang turned to look at Yingying and threw across a command token.</p><p>“Go to the Xiang family and look for the family head of the Xiang family with this order. Ask him to find a woman between sixteen and twenty-eight years old with excellent aptitude, high cultivation level, an interesting personality and exquisite looks and figure. I want all the information and ask him to send two candidates over first.</p><p>“Oh right, all of them must be virgins.”</p><p>“Also, get the Xiang family to gather the faction they can mobilize and find the candidates according to the above criteria. Their backgrounds must be clean and their information must be complete. Send them directly to me for a look. There’s no need for them to go through the hands of others.”</p><p>Before Aunt Xiang could finish speaking, Yingying was instantly stunned and appeared even more confused than Qiao’er.</p><p>This…</p><p>What was all this for?</p><p>Was she selecting a concubine for Xu Gusheng?</p><p>What kind of deal did they complete when they went upstairs? Could it be the reason why that sickly young master looked so weak…</p><p>“What was on your mind?” Aunt Xiang asked with a smile.</p><p>“Nothing!” Yingying shuddered. “I remember all your instructions. I remember everything. I’ll do it immediately! ”</p><p>“No rush.” Aunt Xiang paused and her eyes narrowed. “Tell the Xiang family to report to me about the happenings at the Saint Mountain today.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>After the two received their orders, they slowly retreated.</p><p>Just as she was about to open the door, Qiao’er couldn’t restrain herself any longer. She stopped in her tracks and turned around as if she wanted to say something.</p><p>“You wanted to ask why you two were chosen, right?” Aunt Xiang smiled as if she had read her mind.</p><p>“Yes.” Qiao’er replied weakly.</p><p>She still couldn’t understand why Aunt Xiang appointed them for this task this time since Xu Gusheng was so important.</p><p>There were plenty of people in the Yougui Pavilion who had better looks and figures than the two of them. How did they get the opportunity to be the two gatekeepers?</p><p>Aunt Xiang smiled and said.</p><p>“The big shots have their own worlds. They don’t remember too many names.”</p><p>“You two were fated. Just now, the way you performed amid the chaos was also alright. You were able to whisk him out fast and he barely recalled the incident.”</p><p>“Since that was the case, this good karma belongs to you. Keep up the good work. It’s up to you to see how far you can go in the future.”</p><p>Qiao’er and Yingying were both shocked. They recalled the scene when the Ghost God gang arrived and they had rushed in immediately to get the sickly young master to leave.</p><p>Was it due to that?</p><p>But that was only because that the young master was a little handsome. Just because of that?</p><p>“Sometimes, fate is just a word…” Aunt Xiang cupped her cheeks and stared at the two cute little girls.</p><p>“Thank you, Aunt Xiang!” Only then did the two girls leave in high spirits.</p><p>The wooden door closed.</p><p>The smile on Aunty Xiang’s face disappeared and she was her usual composed self.</p><p>She stood up and slowly poured herself a cup of tea. She held the steaming teacup, and looked at the myriad of colors outside the window.</p><p>There were carriages, horses and people. The market place bustled with life.</p><p>The Jade Capital City had not changed for decades. It was the same before she came back, and it was the same after she came back.</p><p>It was as if this city had been like this before and would be like this in the future. It would always be prosperous.</p><p>“Xu Gusheng, is your arrival a blessing or a curse…”</p><p>Aunt Xiang muttered to herself as she leaned against the window sill. She gazed at the distant Saint Mountain and was so deep in thought that her tea cooled down slowly.</p><p>When the sky turned dark, a streak of white floated down from the sky and fell into the teacup and melted away.</p><p>The children on the street began to cheer and shout, but what they said were inaudible as they jumped around in excitement.</p><p>Aunt Xiang set her teacup down and subconsciously reached out her hand.</p><p>Not long after, there were a few snowflakes on her palm.</p><p>“It’s snowing…”</p><p>The Yuan Mansion world was filled with greenery.</p><p>Little Junior Sister took care of this place too well.</p><p>Not only had the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer adapted perfectly to the new world, but some spiritual herbs had grown outside the barrier due to the dense vitality.</p><p>Even the hundreds of thousands of alchemy cauldrons that belonged to Greedy the Cat Spirit were surrounded by a circle of green plants.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit felt extremely happy even though it worked extra long hours in this lively spiritual wood!</p><p>The only regret was…</p><p>“There was no one there.”</p><p>The experts of the Yuan Mansion had all left for the Abyss Island for the final battle.</p><p>After they received the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy, they naturally could not enter. They could not wait until they woke up and chose to go their separate ways.</p><p>The only things left in the Yuan Mansion were Ice and Ember, the guardians of the herb garden, the dragon corpse, and other uninhabited scenic spots.</p><p>“Meow…”</p><p>When it sensed its owner’s aura, the only companion during the Heavenly</p><p>Ancestor Legacy, Greedy the Cat Spirit, immediately gave up conducting alchemy and pounced over.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grabbed the fat cat.</p><p>Little chap, you’ve gained a lot of weight again. Was this due to excessive overeating?</p><p>However, didn’t Greedy the Cat Spirit have the swallow attribute? Shouldn’t it be able to digest everything it ate?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer. Only then did he realize that the ‘weeds’ in the outer circle had been cleaned up!</p><p>“You ate all those first and second-grade spirit herbs?” A murderous intent appeared in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes as he shook the fat cat hard.</p><p>“Meow! Meow!” Greedy the Cat Spirit wasn’t afraid. It stuck its head out proudly.</p><p>The message was clear. It clearly said, “Your barrier can’t trap me anymore!” Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>How long had it been since they last met? Greedy the Cat Spirit was able to break the spiritual array outside the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer?</p><p>He took a closer look at the fat cat’s aura, and realized that it was on par with a Cutting Path Spiritual Cultivator.</p><p>This was a ghost beast?</p><p>Its growth was like a rocket, even faster than a cheat like him?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
