(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Before Yu Lingdi could react, the water-type Power Upanishad Formation beneath his feet automatically unfolded.</p><p>At the same time, an even more dazzling and larger array diagram appeared under Water Ghost’s feet that complemented its radiance.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Abyss Island exploded.</p><p>The four symbolic gates that were located in all four directions suddenly swung open. Above the Nine Heavens, a void gate opened as well.</p><p>The five sects had arrived!</p><p>Coupled with the pull of the secondary plane door!</p><p>Yu Lingdi felt that he had returned to the moment when he was hung on the Saint execution ground. The spiritual source in his entire body had been sucked dry and he almost lost consciousness.</p><p>Holy light shone down from the sky and enveloped the survivors, one after another.</p><p>In less than half a breath, the wind blew and everyone lost their forms, including Yu Lingdi.</p><p>It felt cold and desolate.</p><p>The vast Abyss Island had lost all its trivial criticism and became as quiet as an uninhabited island.</p><p>There were only a few Saint Servants left in the arena.</p><p>“Isn’t this a little too much?” Bazhun’an stepped forward and looked up into the sky. His voice was not loud, but the demi-saints could hear him.</p><p>“Not too much…” Water Ghost shook his head. With a twist, he landed on the ground and walked together with him. “He’s too lucky. He has never experienced any setbacks. I don’t want him to walk the same path as me.”</p><p>“He can’t even return to the Holy Divine Palace now, but if he doesn’t return, he will be treated as a true traitor… He’s homeless now.”</p><p>“Would he not be like Gou Wuyue and Yan Wuse when they go back?”</p><p>“You should take him in.”</p><p>“He’s not a dog.”</p><p>Bazhun’an sneered when he heard this.</p><p>Water Ghost also smiled and glanced at him, then added, “I won’t accept things obtained by unscrupulous means.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou flew over from afar with his junior sister in tow. He had a suspicious look on his face. “I have reason to suspect that there are some veiled insinuations about me?”</p><p>With a swish, Water Ghost and Bazhun’an’s eyes were fixed on the tightly clasped hands of the Senior Brother and Junior Sister.</p><p>They didn’t even look away!</p><p>They stared intently!</p><p>“+(Suspected, Passive Points+) +2.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s face turned red, and she hurriedly let go.</p><p>“You just gave the Sea God’s Trident away so easily?” Xu Xiaoshou did not notice it and grabbed for the remaining warmth on his hand. It quickly dissipated and he was still not satisfied.</p><p>Water Ghost looked up and glanced at the silver-haired woman’s face. He nodded and said.</p><p>“I taught him how to use the trident since he was young. I should have passed the Sea God’s Trident to him when he grew up.” “Unfortunately, I missed his coming of age ceremony.”</p><p>“This is to make up for being late.”</p><p>“I’m afraid your son won’t appreciate it.” Xu Xiaoshou snorted.</p><p>“He has suffered a lot. All these years, he has survived alone.” Water Ghost stared at him intently.</p><p>“Who did not?” Xu Xiaoshou ignored his stare. “Have you asked the Sea God’s</p><p>Trident about its wishes?”</p><p>“It’s willing.”</p><p>“Bullsh*t! It clearly refused!”</p><p>“What about you?” Water Ghost’s gaze never wavered and there was even a dangerous glint in it.</p><p>“Hehe.” Xu Xiaoshou looked at him and smiled for some time. Then, he chuckled innocently. “As long as he doesn’t provoke me. I won’t let him off easily.”</p><p>Just as Water Ghost was about to speak again, he inadvertently saw Bazhun’an, whose chin was cupped in his hand, at the side. He seemed to be watching a good show.</p><p>He did not say anything.</p><p>He had told him everything.</p><p>Water Ghost sighed. “Give me some face. I’m an Upanishad demi-saint after all. You owe me a lot of favors.</p><p>“Who isn’t a demi-saint?” Xu Xiaoshou tossed the semi-saint person in his hand.</p><p>Water Ghost immediately thought of the saint calamity that he had helped to stop with the aid of the secondary plane door.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was only one step away from sanctification in the Way of the Sword, if only he wanted it?</p><p>This was a freak!</p><p>“Name your conditions, but don’t forget that you still owe me.” Water Ghost looked at Xu and Ba. He had already figured out what these two sneaky people’s ulterior motives were.</p><p>“You’re leaving?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“Yes.” Water Ghost nodded and passed the door to Bazhun’an. “After the cooperation, I will leave the Saint Servant. The world is big, and the demi-saint Upanishad is the most powerful. I will be partially free.”</p><p>“Don’t forget your answer.” Water Ghost stared at Bazhun’an.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed.</p><p>Leave the Saint Servant?</p><p>This was great!</p><p>You’re really a talent, Water Ghost!</p><p>You’re only a higher void and if you can handle such a huge situation like the Abyss Island so well, how can you undergo sanctification?</p><p>How can a talent like you be free?</p><p>Would there be true freedom and happiness in being partially free?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grabbed Water Ghost’s hand with tears in his eyes. “Senior Water Ghost, I have something to say.. Should I say it?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
