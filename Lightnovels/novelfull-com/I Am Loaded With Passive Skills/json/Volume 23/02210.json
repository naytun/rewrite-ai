(3)</h1><p>Chapter 2210: The Saint Servant Is Dead, The Heaven Building Should Be Set Up! (3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“Ptui! The First Pavilion in the Sky!”</p><p>Water Ghost initially had some thoughts about it, but his eyes turned bleak when he saw this.</p><p>He turned around and walked away. “You guys can continue to play. Forgive me for not playing with you.”</p><p>“Hey, don’t go!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou panicked. He quickly withdrew his divine power and shouted at his departing back. “If you don’t cooperate with me, I’ll use my Imitator to turn into you and fight with Yu Lingdi!”</p><p>Water Ghost stopped in his tracks and then continued to walk away.</p><p>“I will tell him that I raised him for half my life and missed his coming-of-age</p><p>ceremony. All that I taught him was fed to the dogs?”</p><p>“You even coveted the Sea God’s Trident? Are you even worthy of being my son?”</p><p>Water Ghost trembled and almost turned around to deal with him.</p><p>“After this scolding, I will tell him how I, Water Ghost, had put in so much effort to save my son in the game on Abyss Island. I will make him cry…”</p><p>“If you really don’t join, then I’ll transform into a woman and play with Yu Lingdi’s feelings. Tsk, this little guy is quite inexperienced. I want him to experience the danger of the human heart… Wu! Lei Xi’er, what are you doing!”</p><p>Everyone looked at Xu Xiaoshou, who was dragged away forcibly and had his mouth clamped, in shock, as if they had seen a terrifying ghost.</p><p>Even Bazhun’an was dumbstruck. He had never seen such a number of ways to deal cards.</p><p>Was this guy still a human?</p><p>Everyone overheard from the side and felt embarrassed for Water Ghost. How could Xu Xiaoshou say such things?</p><p>And…</p><p>This, could this be said?</p><p>“Xu! Xiao! Shou!”</p><p>A furious roar sounded from afar. The red-faced Water Ghost held an Original Sealing Spear and stabbed at him.</p><p>At this moment, his killing intent was revealed. He did not seem to be joking at all.</p><p>Lei Xi’er, Zhu Yike, and Elder Han stepped forward as if they faced a great enemy.</p><p>Mei Siren’s gentle eyes changed. The ferocious sword image in his heart immediately awakened and he brandished the Taicheng Sword.</p><p>“You think I’m joking?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, whose mouth was now uncovered, didn’t know when to call it quits. He still shouted fearlessly.</p><p>“Believe it or not, I can still spread the news!”</p><p>“I knew it. You’re cold on the outside but flirtatious on the inside. You’re like the pinkish purple stripes…”</p><p>Water Ghost’s expression changed drastically. It was as if he was a snake that had been deeply stabbed and almost suffocated. “Shut up! I agree!”</p><p>“Hey! ”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hurried forward and waved Lei Xi’er and the others away before he pressed down on Master Siren’s Taicheng Sword.</p><p>“What are you doing? What are you doing?”</p><p>“Senior Water Ghost was joking with me and wanted to test my sincerity. Why have you drawn your sword?”</p><p>As he suppressed everyone’s overly excited reaction, he hurried forward and extended his hand toward Water Ghost.</p><p>Water Ghost trembled in anger. How could he be in the mood to shake hands?</p><p>“Just shake my hand.” Xu Xiaoshou glanced at Water Ghost’s waist and looked back.</p><p>Water Ghost’s face was almost rigid. He almost activated the ice-type Upanishad, but he soon felt relieved. He put on a fake smile.</p><p>He raised his hand and held it gently.</p><p>“Two hands.’</p><p>Dog… Water Ghost raised his other hand and held him as if he was his dearest friend.</p><p>“Happy cooperation.” Xu Xiaoshou swung his hands wildly and almost dislocated Water Ghost’s arms.</p><p>“It’s just a collaboration. As for the specifics, we’ll see. I’ll just put in my name with the First Pavilion in the Sky.” Water Ghost revealed a gentle smile.</p><p>“+(Locked-on, Passive points+)+l.” “+(Missed, Passive Points)+l.”</p><p>“+(Threatened. Passive Points,+)+l.”</p><p>“Alright, alright. Let’s talk about it again…” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even look at the Information Bar. He wasn’t afraid of Water Ghost.</p><p>What was there to be afraid of?</p><p>Everyone outside the arena was already numb when they watched this scene.</p><p>This historic moment…</p><p>Why?</p><p>Why did all those threats fail to intimidate Water Ghost? Why did Water Ghost give up his resistance only at the last sentence? Did something happen between the two of them?</p><p>Bazhun’an could not hold back his curiosity. “Xu Xiaoshou, what’s with the pinkish purple stripes?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s suspicious gaze moved back and forth between Xu and Water Ghost. Soon, she frowned, and her nose wrinkled and a look of imperceptible disgust flashed across her face.</p><p>“+(Cursed, Passive Points+)+l,+l,+l,+l…”</p><p>“How about it?” Xu Xiaoshou fondled Senior Water Ghost’s smooth and tender palm lovingly. He seemed to want to show their intimacy to Bazhun’an.</p><p>Bazhun’an smiled and crossed his arms.</p><p>“You have indeed grown. The First Pavilion in the Sky can become independent. This was also part of my plan.”</p><p>Really?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not expect Bazhun’an to agree so easily!</p><p>He thought that he would have to spend more time to convince him.</p><p>In the end, if it still didn’t work out, then he would have to do things discreetly in the future and then devour the Saint Servants one step at a time.</p><p>Flush out the Saint Servants and ensure his own growth.</p><p>The First Pavilion in the Sky would definitely be the greatest righteous faction in the future!</p><p>How, how could he agree…</p><p>Bazhun’an smiled as he took out something from his bosom and threw it over.</p><p>“Congratulations, you are now qualified to receive the thing your Master left for you. Take it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou subconsciously reached out to take it.</p><p>It was a command token..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
