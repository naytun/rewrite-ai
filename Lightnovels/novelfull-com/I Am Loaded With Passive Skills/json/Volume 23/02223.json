(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“It had started for me?”</p><p>Kong Yuhen held the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff. The two powers were so harmonious that it was as if they had entered a state of unity.</p><p>When everyone looked over, they actually felt that this person no longer existed. However, his voice echoed clearly in their ears.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated.</p><p>Had it started already?</p><p>We both had the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy. If the start was too hasty, how would the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit judge and choose…</p><p>“Let’s begin.” Bazhun’an nodded.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened his mouth and swallowed the doubts in his heart.</p><p>Just as the Eighth Brother said, even the Abyss Island Spirit was considered a part of the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit.</p><p>It should have some intelligence and know how to choose, right?</p><p>“Buzz! ”</p><p>Inexplicably, the Power Upanishad Formation under Kong Yuhen’s feet lit up.</p><p>This array diagram was too huge!</p><p>The hazy shadows made it impossible to see the true path patterns inside, but they covered the entire Abyss Island.</p><p>As soon as it appeared, everyone present could see the countless giant beasts on the other side of the mirror world. They tried to get a glimpse of the terrifying scene on the Outer Island.</p><p>“Chirp, chirp, chirp!”</p><p>“Screech! Screech! Screech!”</p><p>The chaotic and distant howls of the ghost beasts made the people’s hearts palpitate, but everyone was already used to this feeling.</p><p>Kong Yuhen’s supreme Spatial Upanishad was truly incredible.</p><p>“Is this the strength of the Ten High Nobles? The Spatial Upanishad of a… demi-saint?” Zhu Yike was speechless.</p><p>Before he could think about it, the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff lit up slightly as if it had turned from an illusion to something concrete.</p><p>In an instant, the Power Upanishad Formation under Kong Yuhen’s feet distorted, and a faint pattern fanned out.</p><p>The taste of time…</p><p>“Time Upanishad?”</p><p>This time, not only Zhu Yike but even Water Ghost and Mei Siren had a huge shock.</p><p>However, they quickly realized that this wasn’t the power of the Upanishad. It was just the perfect use of the way of time.</p><p>“It’s not an Upanishad…” Water Ghost calmed down and looked at Kong Yuhen’s back with a complicated expression. “But it’s already the embryonic form of the</p><p>Upanishad.”</p><p>He was an Upanishad demi-saint, so he knew how difficult it had been.</p><p>But this person before him not only had the Upanishad space attributes, but he also had the embryonic form of the Upanishad. How did he cultivate it?</p><p>Water Ghost didn’t know much about Kong Yuhen, but he felt that no matter how talented a person was, they might not be able to comprehend the true meaning of time even when they were in their mother’s wombs or even if they cultivated ten reincarnation cycles, right?</p><p>“He is very blurry…”</p><p>Water Ghost frowned, and he could not quite describe the special feeling he had when he looked at Kong Yuhen.</p><p>He suddenly thought that Kong Yuhen did not belong to this era or did not even exist at all.</p><p>This was based on the keen intuition of an Upanishad demi-saint!</p><p>However, when he regained his senses, Water Ghost felt that this idea was very abrupt and absurd.</p><p>He turned to look at the others and paid special attention to Mei Siren’s condition.</p><p>However, he did not see any similar expression on his face. It was as if he was the only one who had discovered this secret, or perhaps it was an illusion. Strange… Water Ghost suppressed his doubts and did not say anything. He was not the type who would ask questions out of curiosity.</p><p>Beside him, Bazhun’an also looked at the Power Upanishad Formation under Kong Yuhen’s feet and was slightly surprised.</p><p>These two layers of the power of the Upanishad, even if one of them was only in its embryonic form, was still something rarely seen in the world.</p><p>“No wonder he was willing to attack…”</p><p>“It seems that after he watched the battle on Abyss Island, it had helped him a lot.’</p><p>“Was it because Xu Xiaoshou used the ability of the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff and saw Huang Quan’s time and space attributes?”</p><p>Bazhun’an quickly looked away.</p><p>Compared to the previous Kong Yuhen, who was on par with him as one of the Ten High Nobles…</p><p>This current scholarly Kong Yuhen could be said to have recovered his strength very quickly.</p><p>This was even more powerful than the previous Kong Yuhen, one of the Ten High Nobles. He had just appeared, and he still had a long way to go.</p><p>Time factor… Bazhun’an glanced discreetly at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He firmly believed that he had not erred in his judgment.</p><p>In this era, the person who drove the entire history forward could only be Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who pretended to be calm, was actually at a loss. He did not notice the gazes of the outsiders at all.</p><p>“So uncomfortable, so nervous…</p><p>Kong Yuhen restored the Outer Island, and Bazhun’an had a contract with the Inner Island. Then what should I do?</p><p>Just look on?</p><p>This was too awkward…</p><p>With the help of his perception, Xu Xiaoshou continued to act calmly, standing there like a pillar and not thinking about anything else.</p><p>I’ve already done what I needed to do.</p><p>After all, he was a core member who had risked his life for Abyss Island and the Saint Servant.</p><p>Now, what’s wrong with not doing anything and enjoying it a little?</p><p>This was a gift! Bazhun’an said it himself, so how could there be any need for the recipient of the gift to work hard?</p><p>When he had this thought, as expected, he felt much more comfortable.</p><p>Unknowingly, Kong Yuhen found a withered branch of a phantom hyacinth.</p><p>The spirit plants of the Ghost City of the Netherworld represented immortality, but they had lost all signs of life after the battle between the demi-saints and the Holy Emperor.</p><p>“Reincarnation. ”</p><p>Kong Yuhen stared into the void and said this in a vague manner.</p><p>The Power Upanishad Formation under his feet spun slightly as he spoke.</p><p>Soon, it fused with the Way of the Heavens and disappeared into the void.</p><p>At the same time, the withered branch in his hand trembled slightly and spat out ghostly blue waves..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
