(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>All forms of lives throbbed violently!</p><p>Everyone at the back sensed the abnormality at the same time.</p><p>The rules of Abyss Island seemed to have entered a special order. It was as if time flowed in the reverse and it was also like the cycle of reincarnation.</p><p>The dead beings without spiritual intelligence revived, as if they were being reborn. Just like the phantom hyacinth in Kong Yuhen’s hands, they could end it all and they could also welcome the dawn.</p><p>“Reshaping life…”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s voice trembled as if he had witnessed a miracle. He looked at the phantom hyacinth that had completed its reincarnation and had been reborn.</p><p>Whoosh.</p><p>As the wind blew, the phantom blue colored waves danced with the wind and drifted to all the places that had been destroyed after the war.</p><p>The First Hall of Sins, the Blood World, the Ghost City of the Netherworld, the Fallen Abyss, the Desolate Inferno Domain…</p><p>The hyacinth’s life petals flew into the most miserable extreme grounds. As soon as the blue color disappeared, the extreme grounds began a cycle of rebirth.</p><p>The gravel trembled, returned, and gathered…</p><p>The ancient palace was being reconstructed, reshaped, and restored…</p><p>The scars on the earth were moistened by the flowing water…</p><p>The broken ancient wood were stitched up by the breeze…</p><p>All traces of the landscape seemed to change, as if spring had arrived after the rain. They were filled with vitality.</p><p>Of course, there were some things that could not be salvaged. After all, they had suffered the attacks of the Holy Emperor. Kong Yuhen did not try to force their revival.</p><p>They went with the wind and returned to the end of life. That was their fate.</p><p>Those who could return were able to recall with nostalgia and reverted to their original appearances.</p><p>Kong Yuhen only had a phantom hyacinth in his hand, but the petals flew away and drifted to different places.</p><p>It was beautiful yet shocking at the same time!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes widened.</p><p>Was this Kong Yuhen?</p><p>The combination of time and space were able to heal the wounds of the entire Abyss Island?</p><p>This was too ridiculous!</p><p>“This is a demi-saint?” Zhu Yike couldn’t help but whisper again. After a long while, he couldn’t find anyone who dared to talk to him. He could only look at his old comrade, Elder Han. “You’re also a demi-saint. Can you do that?”</p><p>Elder Han who was in shock, looked away and glared at Zhu Yike beneath his drooping eyelids, over Lei Xi’er’s head. “Are you trying to insult me?”</p><p>“He’s definitely not an ordinary demi-saint…” Water Ghost couldn’t help but look over.</p><p>“Then he can only be a Holy Emperor.” Mei Siren quickly fanned himself and was in a state of disbelief when he saw the miracle of life that unfolded before him.</p><p>“But it doesn’t seem like it. He doesn’t have that very pure kind of… Holy Emperor’s power.” Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but pull back. He felt that he was no longer worthy to stand beside Kong Yuhen so he joined the other people instead.</p><p>He had fought against a Holy Emperor before, so he understood clearly the power of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>Lei Xi’er shook her head slightly as if she remembered something. “Low level Holy Emperors are different from the high level Holy Emperors. If one is above the seventh realm, he will have the power to become Gods and ancestors…” Power of the ancestral source?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was astute. He realized that his vision might have been too narrow. He was only aware of a few types of power of the ancestral source. Power of Divinity, Diabolical Force, Power of the evil God and the God of death…</p><p>When he viewed Kong Yuhen’s ability with this mindset, a word popped up in Xu Xiaoshou’s mind:</p><p>“The power of the Time Ancestor?”</p><p>This was the first time Xu Xiaoshou had seen such a display of the power of the ancestral source that did not leave any trace.</p><p>There were no fancy special effects or eye-catching colors. It was as simple and natural as drinking and eating.</p><p>The world began to recover.</p><p>This could also be considered a realm… Xu Xiaoshou muttered to himself and wondered if this was because Kong Yuhen’s realm was too high, or if it was the actual power of the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff.</p><p>There was no answer to that.</p><p>Soon, his thoughts involuntarily returned to the scene of the magnificent world reconstruction in front of him. He forgot what his thoughts were about just now.</p><p>The reconstruction happened very quickly.</p><p>However, after half a day in the outside world, the nine extreme grounds had mostly recovered under the power of the phantom hyacinth.</p><p>The general framework of the First Hall of Sins was back.</p><p>Even sites like the Ghost City of the Netherworld that had been pried up and smashed by the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, after its guidance to the Great Path, was reorganized and reestablished to a new order.</p><p>Places like the Blood World, that had experienced the Hurricane Belt and were completely changed by the power of the Holy Emperors, also returned. There were mountains of corpses and seas of blood.</p><p>“Even the power of a Holy Emperor can be rewritten…”</p><p>Although Wangze Holy Emperor was no longer around, the traces he left behind could be erased along with the reincarnation. This was a clear confirmation of something.</p><p>Everyone looked at Kong Yuhen in a different light.</p><p>This jade-faced scholar had a delicate and pretty demeanor. However, just like Bazhun’an, he was someone not to be trifled with at all!</p><p>“Very good, it’s my turn.”</p><p>Most of Abyss Island’s layout had been restored. To do any more would be a waste of time and energy.</p><p>At this point, Kong Yuhen’s face was pale and it was obvious he had spent a lot of energy.</p><p>Bazhun’an was moved.</p><p>He threw aside the secondary plane door and his sword cognition erupted from his fingertip and stabbed into it.</p><p>“Imperial order! ”</p><p>A loud shout resonated around the area.</p><p>With a buzz, Abyss Island shook violently.</p><p>Under the influence of the Power Upanishad Formation, the surreal boundaries of the Inner Island appeared as fragile as paper that could be torn apart easily. The layout of the Inner Island with all the ghost beasts, was clearly visible.</p><p>But no one was disrespectful, and no ghost beast was presumptuous.</p><p>The ghost beasts on the Inner Island that were supposed to be drooling over the outside world in the mirror world were now like tigers, that huddled in their places.</p><p>“Greetings, Lord Bazhun’an!”</p><p>“Greetings, Lord Bazhun’an!”</p><p>Voices came from the Inner Island, mixed with excitement, fear, and</p><p>reverence. They tried their best to speak in unison. They communicated with the outside world through the power of the secondary plane door..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
