It transformed into a branch and took away the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff. “No resistance?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little surprised.</p><p>This was the first time he had seen a tree that could see and take away the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff, apart from himself and Kong Yuhen</p><p>And the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff was so obedient?</p><p>Shouldn’t this staff’s temperament be more arrogant?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had this thought as he stretched out his hand to reach into the void.</p><p>“Crack.”</p><p>A cracking sound could be heard. The branch that the Dragon Apricot Spirit had brandished was split in half, and the Dragon Apricot Spirit froze in the air.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Time Ancestor Shadow Staff in his hand.</p><p>F*ck, why did it come back?</p><p>“Human brat!”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit glared at him with a murderous gaze. It felt as if the high and mighty image it had created had disappeared.</p><p>“Cough cough, Senior, continue. Senior, please continue. What happened just now was purely an accident…” Xu Xiaoshou looked away sheepishly and handed over the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff.</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit blew out two streams of scorching air from its nostrils and its dragon whiskers swayed wildly. However, it was still very tolerant. It suppressed its anger and glared fiercely at the human before it swept away the Ancestral Shadow Staff again.</p><p>This time Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to do anything.</p><p>“So it really just borrowed the weapon and has no control over it at all. With a thought, the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff will come back.”</p><p>While he mulled over this, the Dragon Apricot Spirit had already moved off.</p><p>It indeed had the right to be arrogant, or perhaps it should be said that it was exceedingly so!</p><p>In the eyes of Xu Xiaoshou, an ordinary demi-saint, such as Jiang Buyi, couldn’t make the world evolve.</p><p>However, the Dragon Apricot Spirit was a creature that had existed for too long. What kinds of storms and waves had it not seen and experienced?</p><p>As one of the World Trees, it was easy for it to evolve into a world.</p><p>When the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff was swept into the crown of the tree, the Dragon Apricot Spirit also shrank back into the Apricot Dragon, as if it was about to enter a deep sleep.</p><p>In the next second, a series of complicated dragon patterns lit up on the main trunk of the Ancestral Tree and emitted a dazzling golden light.</p><p>There was clearly no wind, but all the Holy Medicine in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer trembled and bowed toward the center.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot began to increase in size and rose steadily.</p><p>Under Xu Xiaoshou’s astonished gaze, its height broke through 10 feet,100 feet, 1,000 feet…</p><p>In the end, the Dragon Apricot was so tall and huge that its height could not be measured. Just its trunk alone pierced through the clouds.</p><p>The Herb Garden of Divine Farmer did not collapse due to this because the Dragon Apricot had turned into an ethereal illusion.</p><p>It was completely embedded into the space, as if it was symbiotic with Heaven and Earth and became a lifelike pattern.</p><p>“World Tree…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt the terrifying pressure that came from all directions and thought of this concept again.</p><p>The vibes that the Dragon Apricot Spirit gave off was that its combat strength was one of a weak demi-saint at best.</p><p>It couldn’t even be compared to a finger of the Seven Trees Emperor!</p><p>But now, after it entered the Yuan Mansion world, Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he faced a true Holy Emperor.</p><p>“These are the Nine Great Ancestral Trees…”</p><p>“How lazy was this guy usually? If it really doesn’t do anything, can it stay hidden until the end of time?”</p><p>“Fortunately, I didn’t completely offend it just now and maintained the respect I deserve.”</p><p>“Let me just say it. A sudden whim might not be real, but it’s absolutely credible. With the fame of the Ancestral Tree, no matter how weak it looks, it’s not to be trifled with.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot pattern disappeared into the void and remained silent for about Ten Auras. After that, it was completely activated.</p><p>The golden light illuminated the entire Yuan Mansion world.</p><p>The illusory pattern shook, and countless golden branches fell from the sky. The sky was also illuminated with endless golden light.</p><p>These golden spots scattered into the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, the poisonous fish pond, the Zhang Mansion’s broken tower, and the hundreds of thousands of alchemy cauldrons… Even within the Chaotic Mist.</p><p>Everything he saw had been touched by it!</p><p>“Meow! ”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit’s reaction was seven times faster. It moved around and pounced on the golden spots and left countless afterimages. It felt very happy.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the beautiful and dazzling scene as if he had seen a miracle. He stretched out his hand in a daze and wanted to grasp the golden light.</p><p>At this moment, an ethereal voice sounded from the Nine Heavens, like a great bell that was rather thought-provoking.</p><p>“Dao becomes a seed, and the Saint Light descends… When the scales appear, the world can be saved…”</p><p>“Empty and undetermined, nothing left … The duckweed leaves, the world hoes the wasteland…”</p><p>“The desires of life and death, the structure of reincarnation… primordial beginning, the end of the snow…”</p><p>The Saint Language was intermittent and vague and flowed like quicksand between his fingertips.</p><p>He could listen to the words, but when he tried to remember them, he felt that they had slipped away in his mind.</p><p>He couldn’t remember anything.</p><p>He couldn’t understand anything.</p><p>However, the world was evolving. This was something that could be seen with the naked eye.</p><p>When the golden spots shone along with the Saint Language, the Chaotic Mist shrank, the earth morphed, and the space was broken, reformed, and reborn.</p><p>Life!</p><p>A new start!</p><p>The Yuan Mansion world rapidly transformed!</p><p>The soil was pushed aside, as if it had been plowed by a god. As the space twisted and turned, new land was revealed…</p><p>The greenery spread throughout like the gaze of a god; it climbed over the rapidly forming hills, grasslands, and swamps…</p><p>This Transformation was too fast and too overwhelming!</p><p>Terrain, water flow, climate, Yin and Yang, four seasons, elements, sun and moon… Wait, wait, wait!</p><p>“This is too exaggerated.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed as he witnessed the miracles that took place in his Yuan Mansion world in such a short period of time.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot seemed to understand what type of world it wanted the most was. It controlled a God-like power to create an environment that was suitable for human habitation..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
