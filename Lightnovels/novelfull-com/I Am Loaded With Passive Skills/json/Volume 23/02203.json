(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>At that time, Xu Xiaoshou and even Mu Zixi thought that such a statement was too powerful for a higher void, so they treated it as a joke.</p><p>There was no situation that a demi-saint and a Holy Emperor couldn’t break through.</p><p>Now that the battle on Abyss Island was over, Lei Xi’er believed that when Xu Xiaoshou awakened, he would understand that Bazhun’an had never joked about it, just like her.</p><p>“God Sealing…”</p><p>“After I surpassed a demi-saint and a Holy Emperor, I’m headed directly for the realm of God and Ancestor…</p><p>“Was that his true ambition?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er pursed her lips silently and glanced at Xu Xiaoshou in her arms.</p><p>She felt that if she only relied on herself, she would never have such a crazy idea in her entire life.</p><p>However, with Xu Xiaoshou around, she could calmly accept such a crazy existence.</p><p>The man who currently slept so soundly in her arms was no less ambitious than this.</p><p>On the horizon, Dao Qiongcang’s face was already pale.</p><p>It was precisely because of the importance he attached to Bazhun’an’s words that he could not ignore it, unlike those said by the others.</p><p>But after he thought about it carefully, it was still too infuriating!</p><p>After so many years, Bazhun’an was still so arrogant that even he, Dao Qiongcang, was not worthy of his attention?</p><p>Ha, how egotistical he was!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang sneered. He quickly calmed down and said, “Different professions are like different mountains. I can only wish you success.”</p><p>“I can’t wish you success!” Bazhun’an retorted. “I don’t know about others,</p><p>Elder Dao the Flamboyant, but I know a thing or two about your thoughts…”</p><p>As he paused for a moment, Bazhun’an glanced at Lei Xi’er, or more accurately, at Xu Xiaoshou, and shook his head.</p><p>“My advice to you is not to.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s eyes narrowed and he remained silent.</p><p>At this exact moment, Xu Xiaoshou who was in Lei Xi’er’s arms, squeaked and opened his eyes and saw how Bazhun’an turned away.</p><p>“Are they talking about me?” He used his Perception to take in the entire scene.</p><p>“You’re awake?” Lei Xi’er was pleasantly surprised.</p><p>“No, it’s your aged eyes that are blurry… Were they talking about me?”</p><p>“+(Cursed, Passive Points+)+l.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s beautiful eyes turned cold. She threw Xu Xiaoshou off and spat. “You’re thinking too much. Are you that important?”</p><p>“I’m very important!” Xu Xiaoshou smacked his lips and hovered in the air and felt the cold breeze upon him. It was clearly not as sweet as the soft warm embrace he just experienced. He suddenly regretted that he had woken up.</p><p>However, it was more important to sense the energy reserve instantly. Not long after, Xu Xiaoshou saw that his energy reserve was empty and his foundational roots were damaged.</p><p>His heart thumped in shock and Xu Xiaoshou’s face turned pale.</p><p>“How are you?” Lei Xi’er supported the dazed fool who almost fell after he staggered about.</p><p>“It’s alright. There aren’t any major problems…” Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand as he cursed in his heart.</p><p>The crack in his energy reserve was due to the damage to his foundational roots!</p><p>His passive skills circulated about crazily, but it only managed to rouse him. He did not know if his remaining injuries could be healed.</p><p>Even if he could, if he were to judge from the speed…</p><p>How much time would it take for him to return to his previous state?</p><p>“It can’t really be healed, right?”</p><p>“Indeed. When he forcefully accepted the power of the four Holy Emperors, and finally slashed out the Wisdom is Emptiness when he was exhausted… it was too much!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had a strange expression for a short time, but he finally calmed himself down.</p><p>Nothing serious, nothing serious…</p><p>Bazhun’an lost two fingers and had not recovered after so many years, yet he could still continue to cultivate the sword.</p><p>The injuries on his body should be insignificant.</p><p>While he was doing his own psychological therapy, when Lei Xi’er saw Xu Xiaoshou’s indifferent ‘don’t worry’ look, she knew immediately that this guy was in big trouble.</p><p>She didn’t say anything more. She just grabbed Xu Xiaoshou’s hand and accompanied him quietly.</p><p>“+(Received Concern, Passive Points+)+l.”</p><p>“There’s no need to worry…” As Xu Xiaoshou said this, his body suddenly stiffened. He felt his hands go numb; they were scalded and turned into Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand.</p><p>Very quickly, he looked toward the battlefield. “What were they talking about?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er glanced at him. “They’re talking about things that are not real. Ordinary people would not understand.”</p><p>“That’s you!”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“Oh, I mean, tell me, maybe I can understand.”</p><p>“Ha, you’re so smart.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er glanced at him coldly and decided not to argue with the injured person. She told him what the two had said just now.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his chin thoughtfully.</p><p>Bazhun’an had big plans, and Dao Qiongcang probably had planned something on a large scale as well.</p><p>But the former sealed the sword in order to become a God, and what did the latter do it for?</p><p>The same?</p><p>Or was it for something else that achieved the same result?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind suddenly flashed with the memory of the arm that seemed to be made of jade that Dao Qiongcang had displayed before. It was enough to knock away the power of the Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison Holy Emperor.</p><p>He recalled that Elder Dao the Flamboyant was actually a calm person on the outside, but he was crazy on the inside. He was so crazy that his research was stopped by the five Holy Emperors’ aristocratic families.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had some guesses.</p><p>Perhaps the path was different, but what Dao Qiongcang had plotted was not much lesser than Bazhun’an’s path to Godhood, or perhaps it was even more shocking?</p><p>The two people in the distance fell into a short stalemate, as if they were old friends who had reunited. They looked at each other for a long time and there were clear signs of affection.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gazed on this scene and he sneered.</p><p>However, the confrontation between the two quickly collapsed.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang suddenly laughed. “An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.” How can summer insects have any vision? Measure others by their own limitations! ”</p><p>Bazhun’an flicked away the dead insect in his palm away and said softly: “Ants follow the path of death.”</p><p>“Bazhun’an, you’re too arrogant!”</p><p>“You failed because you didn’t deserve your position. That was the reason why you were stopped, so give up..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
