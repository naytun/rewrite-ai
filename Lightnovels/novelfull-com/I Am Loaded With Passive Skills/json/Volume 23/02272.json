Hurry up! Tell me the truth!” Xu Xiaoshou questioned it.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit meowed loudly. It was obvious that it was not afraid of its owner and even tried to provoke him.</p><p>It lowered its head and raised it again. A strange light flashed in its eyes at the same time.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Three strange spots emerged from its eyes and rotated at the same frequency before they finally merged into its pupils.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>He recalled that Greedy the Cat had only one of the Three Loathsome Eyes and the flowers were gray in color and it was located in its left eye…</p><p>But what about its right eye?</p><p>What were those three blood-colored flowers?</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>“Three Tribulation Eyes?!”</p><p>After he realized what it was, Xu Xiaoshou’s scalp went numb.</p><p>Didn’t he throw that item to Lei Xi’er and told her to deal with it? How did it end up in Greedy the Cat Spirit’s body?</p><p>It was not important anymore!</p><p>When he heard the sounds of an explosion, Xu Xiaoshou looked up at the sky. He saw the Yuan Mansion world where the rules were still in its final-stage, appear and seemed to be in a state of shock as it tried its best to control a thick cloud that had condensed and seemed to be out of control.</p><p>“You scammer, quickly close your eyes!”</p><p>Nine Death Thunder Calamity!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t expect that Greedy the Cat Spirit would summon the Nine Death Thunder Calamity before he could stabilize his Sovereign Dao Realm and before his Dao had been cut off!</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit was shocked. After a shiver, it quickly withdrew the power in its eyes. It cowered behind its little claws as if it knew it had done something bad.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou finally understood why the powerful Huang Quan and</p><p>Mei Siren couldn’t suppress their powers and had to transcend the tribulation.</p><p>Once the Three Tribulation Eyes appeared, even if one’s power was cut off, the calamity clouds would automatically condense and would not dissipate.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou panicked.</p><p>After all, he had never experienced the transcend the tribulation at the Cutting Path Stage. All he had seen were the saint calamity and the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation, and so on.</p><p>However, he could be considered as someone who had experienced bigger happenings than this. In an instant, he could tell that there was something wrong with this calamity cloud.</p><p>First of all, his Nine Death Thunder Calamity could not be so weak.</p><p>Secondly, the Yuan Mansion world was still unstable. Even if there was a prototype of the world, it would still be unable to form a complete calamity cloud.</p><p>Under such circumstances, the calamity clouds were like child’s play at the moment. It seemed that he could even slice them apart with one hand?</p><p>“Guard…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou called out and hurriedly stopped him. “Wait!”</p><p>The second true body had already discharged the Vanishing Technique and pulled out Hidden Bitter. It stopped in mid-air and was well aware of what the original body wanted to try.</p><p>Hidden Bitter could already imagine the scene where it slashed the calamity cloud as it flew into the sky. It became so excited that its body wriggled like a maggot and it chirped away,</p><p>“Oh! Wuuu! Ouch!”</p><p>“Shut up.” The second true body hit the sword violently.</p><p>The original body looked at the calamity cloud and did not move at all. The aura on his body slowly receded, as if he had returned to his original state.</p><p>Although the calamity cloud was a little weak, it still possessed the characteristics of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity and could lock onto the person who transcend the tribulation.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried to see if he could break the lock with his sword technique.</p><p>“Hidden Word Formula!”</p><p>The sword pattern spread out in the void, and then the fluctuations were extracted from all the things that were available. It turned into sword power and gathered into Xu Xiaoshou’s body.</p><p>This scene was similar to when he was on Abyss Island, outside the Forest of Miracles and Bazhun’an had summoned back the wisp of sword energy that had escaped from his body.</p><p>Yes, the technique that Xu Xiaoshou used came from Bazhun’an.</p><p>That guy was the Boss of the Hidden Sword Technique. He had hidden away for decades. No one knew what he was up to.</p><p>When he was in the Eighth Palace, he was able to use a withered branch as a sword to kill Gou Wuyue’s godly beliefs. This was something that Xu Xiaoshou thought was incredible.</p><p>If such a powerful ancient swordsman could use a withered branch to make a sword move, it would probably not be inferior to the last level of his Sword Technique Expertise right?</p><p>In that case, how would Bazhun’an stop his sword saint calamity?</p><p>The answer was the Hidden Word Formula!</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou woke up on Abyss Island after he received the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy, he had specially asked the Hidden Sword Technique Boss for this move and he had been rather reluctant at that time.</p><p>But it didn’t matter.</p><p>If his comprehension wasn’t enough, he would use his Upanishad to make up for it.</p><p>The Way of the Sword Disc spun out from under his feet and entered the Unity of Man and the Heavens.</p><p>Tens of thousands of sword forces gathered in his body and finally turned into a sealed word ‘Hidden’ that suppressed his aura above his energy reserve.</p><p>In the void, the second true body had yet to draw its sword when the calamity clouds seemed to be startled for a moment before they dispersed.</p><p>“It’s done.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was overjoyed.</p><p>This was what the Hidden Sword Technique was all about!</p><p>If the Nine Death Thunder Calamity couldn’t sense it, what about the saint calamity?</p><p>With the incomplete World Order of the Yuan Mansion world and the slow amassment of the calamity clouds, would all his passive skills be able to reach the Holy Emperor level?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grabbed the little fat cat and held it in front of his face.</p><p>“Wu wu…” Greedy the Cat Spirit was on the verge of tears. Tears welled up in its eyes, and it knew that it had caused some problems.</p><p>Who knew that its owner would suddenly raise his head and laugh like a maniac. He smothered the cat with kisses.</p><p>“Hahaha, you’re really my lucky star. I have hopes of slaying a Saint!”</p><p>Ugh…</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit didn’t dare to move at all. Indeed, every time his owner entered the Yuan Mansion, his mind would go crazy.</p><p>If nothing unexpected happened, this was just the beginning….</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
