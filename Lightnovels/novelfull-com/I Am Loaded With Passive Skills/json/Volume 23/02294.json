One enjoyed a moment of peace.</p><p>“It’s good to be here…”</p><p>The Dayan Grotto-Heaven was one of Dao Qiongcang’s Spiritual Site on the Saint Mountain.</p><p>This place was originally just a place for him to practice his divine cultivation. Later on, because the impact was too great, it was drawn out and sealed in space and became his personal property.</p><p>Unlike the other Spiritual Site that required servants to upkeep, the Dayan Grotto-Heaven looked full of vitality, but there were no human sounds around.</p><p>There was no one here all year round. It was an established rule.</p><p>However, even though the mountain was filled with bamboo forests and there were birds and beasts here, the first impression one had after one stepped in was that it was spotless.</p><p>Even the shifting sand and stones on the ground seemed to be filled with the rhythm of the path energy.</p><p>When the wind blew, the sand would fall where it should.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang walked into the bamboo forest.</p><p>The bamboo forest rustled.</p><p>Bamboo, birds, beasts, stones, flowers, grass, clouds, air, wind, light, color, sound… All the natural elements in the world shifted as they kept pace with each step he took.</p><p>One step, ten thousand Transformation, the factors involved were countless.</p><p>After he took ten steps, even a demi-saint might not remember clearly what kind of arrangement and combination they had gone through in the Dayan</p><p>Grotto-Heaven.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang took a leisurely stroll.</p><p>If any outsiders came here, they would not be aware of the consequences if they took a wrong step.</p><p>Not long after, he walked into the center of the forest.</p><p>The scenery of the Dayan Grotto-Heaven had already changed from that of a lush forest to a fragrant peach blossom garden.</p><p>It was clearly not late in the outside world, but night had long fallen here. Dao Qiongcang stopped, and after Ten Auras, he quickly took three steps to the north.</p><p>The first step measured ten feet.</p><p>The second step measured 12 feet.</p><p>The third step was only 3-3 feet.</p><p>“Buzz! ”</p><p>Everything before his eyes turned dark and he could not even see his fingers.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had entered a sealed world.</p><p>“Gululu…”</p><p>It sounded like someone blowing bubbles in the water, and it lasted for a long time.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang ignored it.</p><p>In the darkness, he slowly took off his shirt.</p><p>He still couldn’t see anything in front of him, but if he walked a few steps forward according to his memory, there would be a medicinal barrel located there.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang crawled in and soaked himself in the medicinal barrel. He slowly immersed his entire body in the medicinal liquid that was neither sticky nor thick, even his head. He allowed the surging power to soothe his muscles and spirit.</p><p>“Gululu…”</p><p>He also began to spit out bubbles.</p><p>After about 15 minutes, Dao Qiongcang’s head emerged from the medicinal liquid.</p><p>As if he had finished his cultivation, he gently exhaled a long breath of turbid air in the darkness.</p><p>“Hu, I feel so comfortable…</p><p>“How is the outside world?” A low voice came from the side.</p><p>“You’re awake?” Dao Qiongcang didn’t even turn his head. Clearly, he was used to the existence of this voice. “Everything is fine.”</p><p>“I heard that most of the five Holy Emperors’ aristocratic families have entered the human realm and occupied the majority of the seats in the Council of Ten. There should be chaos soon. How can they still be safe?”</p><p>“It had nothing to do with me.”</p><p>“The Saint Servant is really difficult to deal with. If I’m not mistaken, Bazhun’an will appoint Xu Xiaoshou as the second-in-command. He will be the biggest surprise.” The voice said.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“I have made the calculations. The Southern Region’s Xu Yue Grey Palace won’t enjoy peace either. Palace Master Bai Zhou should be able to see through the Saint Servant’s ambition. If he doesn’t follow up, he won’t have a chance to get involved again.”</p><p>“Your calculations are pretty good.”</p><p>“Bazhun’an and the others didn’t dare to cooperate in the past and they might not have the courage in the future. There’s a high chance that they’ll need the new Lord Shou to be the middleman at this time, so he is still the key person.”</p><p>“Yes.” Dao Qiongcang’s gaze pierced through the darkness. “Xu Xiaoshou is already in the Central Region.”</p><p>The voice in the darkness laughed silently. “Then the storm is coming!”</p><p>The conversation paused for a short while.</p><p>There was only dead silence around them, but even their breathing and heartbeats could not be heard.</p><p>It was as if there were no living beings here.</p><p>“Continue.” Dao Qiongcang said.</p><p>The voice rang out again. “If I were you, the Eastern Region would undergo changes later. You need to take down Xiao Kongtong as soon as possible. One month later, when the list of the Seven Sword Deity is confirmed, I’m afraid one of them will undergo sanctification.”</p><p>“Continue.”</p><p>“Changde Town at the Qingyuan Mountain needs to be set up early. The eagles can’t catch the ardent birds. Once the time is right, it will be too late to go.”</p><p>“Continue.”</p><p>“Just the power of a god slayer from the Ran Ming Ruins alone would tempt the world, but not Bazhun’an. He must have other plans.” The topics that this voice talked about were varied.</p><p>“Continue.” But there was no reaction from Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>. it seems that you have thought of everything I’ve thought of. Since that’s the case, why would I continue? There’s no need for that.”</p><p>“All that you brought up were indeed not a surprise This is a step backward.” Dao Qiongcang laughed.</p><p>In the darkness, the voice fell silent again.</p><p>“Then let’s talk about progress.” Dao Qiongcang paused. “You died while you were unconscious.”</p><p>“Oh?” The voice sounded surprised. “How did I do?”</p><p>“You are loyal, you have desires, you are scheming, and you have principles. In short, you are impeccable. You have far surpassed me.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t dare.” The sound of splashing water could be heard from the medicinal barrel beside him. It was as if someone had completely raised his upper body. Number 64’s design still had some obvious flaws.</p><p>“For example?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
