He stood stock still as his face turned purple. In the end, he turned around and left with his fan.</p><p>“You guys have fun, I won’t be with you.”</p><p>“Hey, don’t!” Aunt Xiang hurriedly stood up. “Don’t you want your ‘peerless genius’?”</p><p>“As long as I don’t get involved, why do I need so many people? The First Pavilion in the Sky’s configuration is already sufficient.”</p><p>“What about your Master? Have you made all the preparations for the attack on the Saint Mountain?”</p><p>There was a click.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had grabbed the door handle, but he stopped in his tracks.</p><p>This door weighed a ton and even the ‘Strengthen’ move in his sacred physique could not push it open for a moment.</p><p>It had to be said that Aunt Xiang’s words struck a chord in Xu Xiaoshou’s heart.</p><p>In the past, he said, “When I ascend to the Sovereign Stage, I would dare to carry my sword to the Saint Mountain.” Now, it seemed like a joke!</p><p>It was far from enough to rely on the strength of only one person.</p><p>The Holy Divine Palace was too huge. Even Bazhun’an needed outside help before he dared to sound the horn to attack.</p><p>Even if he used all his passive skills, ignited his state and expanded to his utmost limit and had the ability to kill a demi-saint… he was not a demi-saint at the Ten High Nobles level. He would be like Jiang Buyi.</p><p>What about the rest?</p><p>If the five Saint Holy Emperor aristocratic family were to take action, there would be at least five Holy Emperors on the forefront, right?</p><p>The Council of Ten could easily gather ten demi-saints who were far more powerful than Jiang Buyi.</p><p>They had the support of the Demi-Saint families who had always stood on the side of the Holy Divine Palace. Even if the quality was like that of Jiang Buyi’s, the quantity was enough.</p><p>The Third Ancestor of the White Vein, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, and Feng Yujin barely made up five Holy Emperor cards.</p><p>The five crippled Holy Emperors were all in poor condition, so even if they were rounded up, they could still fight against the enemy Holy Emperors.</p><p>The remaining ‘Jiang Buyis’ from the Holy Divine Palace would be left to Mei Siren, Yu MO, and the other top people’s combat strength to digest. It would be a one-on-ten battle.</p><p>Even if Bazhun’an converted himself into a Holy Emperor, but he couldn’t just enter the battle so easily. He had to watch for the variables on the other side, right?</p><p>Otherwise, wouldn’t he become like Dao Qiongcang who could be manipulated by anyone on Abyss Island?</p><p>Was this enough?</p><p>It was still not enough, far from enough!</p><p>No matter what, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t gather enough super combat strength to launch a general attack and kill his way up to the Saint Mountain.</p><p>The Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe that loomed over the Jade Capital City , was so small and yet so huge.</p><p>As long as one looked at it, little by little, one would be crushed.</p><p>However, perhaps this Qilin could take it down. It could add some weight to the delicate balance of the scales on their side so it would tilt slightly…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around and said seriously, “Let’s talk about the details. It’s too easy to run into problems if there are only castles in the air.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang’s worried look turned into a smile. She immediately understood how important Sleeveless was to this young man.</p><p>“It’s good that you’re willing to talk, but don’t feel too pressured.”</p><p>“Bazhun’an and Water Ghost were full of praise for you. They said that you completed at least half of the mission that should have been Water Ghost’s mission on Abyss Island.”</p><p>“When you completed that, the Four Divine Pillars had not been opened yet.</p><p>You had to rely on your own abilities.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang patted her ample bosom and declared solemnly.</p><p>“Perhaps to you, you feel that Bazhun’an believed in you and addressed you as Lord Shou because he wanted to tease you.”</p><p>“But I’ve known him for so long, and I’ve never heard him praise anyone like this, even if it was only a joke… Oh, except for The Divine.”</p><p>After a pause, Aunt Xiang shook her head and corrected herself. “No, I should say that he never joked around, even if it sounded like it.”</p><p>“+(Flattered, Passive Points),+l.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was about to smile and reply with a ‘Really?’. However, he saw the Information Bar and felt like he had been doused with cold water and quickly woke up.</p><p>“Stop your flattery.” He returned to the table, sat down and poured himself a glass of wine. “When exactly will we take action?”</p><p>“I can do it anytime in the next few days.” Aunt Xiang was clearly well-prepared. “What about you?”</p><p>“I can’t. I still need to make preparations.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had just received the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy and was rushed to the Yougui Pavilion.</p><p>As a result, he had yet to digest the many spoils of war he had obtained after the battle on Abyss Island.</p><p>The Holy Medicine from the Forest of Miracles, Dragon Apricot, Dragon Blood, the treasures, people, insights, and even the largest value of the Passive Points…</p><p>He had not used any of it yet!</p><p>What he needed now was a small enclosed space.</p><p>Before he entered, he was Xu Xiaoshou. After he came out, he could become Xu the Beast and his combat strength would be more than double in the ancient book.</p><p>“Then I’ll give you some time to prepare. By the way, do you need any outlet to help you to vent?” Aunt Xiang asked.</p><p>“Vent?”</p><p>“For example, Ah Yao.”</p><p>. There’s no need for that!”</p><p>“Oh, so it wasn’t that kind of preparation.” Aunt Xiang looked pensive as she stared at the slightly embarrassed sickly young master. She smiled and said.</p><p>“I won’t tease you anymore. I’ve already invited the people from the First</p><p>Pavilion in the Sky for you. You don’t have to think too much about it.”</p><p>“In a few days, they will enter the city, one after another. At that time, they will meet you in secret. You can tell me who you need.”</p><p>“You’ve been in danger recently. Be careful, even if you’re good at disguising yourself. ”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was surprised. You even invited my people in advance. You’ve really gone all out for the preparations!</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>“You’re welcome. You’re Lord Shou now, the second-in-command saint servant. Your status is even higher than mine, someone who is not a Saint Servant. It’s my duty to take care of these trivial matters for you. I’m doing it for your convenience.”</p><p>“Alright, that’s it. You don’t have to think about the operation. I’ll plan it. Elder Dao the Flamboyant had been very busy recently. Perhaps the worst-case scenario we expected would not happen. Tell me when you’re ready..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
