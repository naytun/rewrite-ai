(4)</p><p>He couldn’t even enunciate his words clearly.</p><p>The Sword Demon acted as if it had not heard anything, and its single eye remained calm and emotionless.</p><p>After it swallowed the grade one spiritual sword, it knew what its mission was.</p><p>Even though it protected Wen Ting previously and looked down on the three Gu family kids, these three kids were still Wen Ting’s disciples. Since it had been sent by Wen Ting to be their bodyguard, it had to fulfill its responsibilities as their bodyguard.</p><p>Moreover, the Gu brat had also paid for its services.</p><p>The higher void could casually attack him. This was a form of tempering.</p><p>However, a Demi-Saint that attacked a young man was too shameless.</p><p>This kind of shameless person should have died long ago. Why should he live in this world?</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>The Sword Demon’s right arm streaked across the sky as the sharp blade in its palm slashed downward.</p><p>Elder Han was almost in despair.</p><p>With his strength, he should not have been taken down so easily by the Sword Demon.</p><p>But he was too careless!</p><p>Half of his arm had just been chopped off by Rao Yaoyao, and he had even been blasted to death by the Saint Calamity.</p><p>When he had less than 10% of his strength left, he had provoked such a monster.</p><p>When he was on the verge of death, a familiar figure appeared in Elder Han’s eyes.</p><p>He knew who the Sword Demon was not because he knew Gu Qingyi.</p><p>It was because he had seen such a person in the past. While he trampled on everyone’s dignity, he also had such a monster by his side.</p><p>That monster was also in human form. It also had no eyebrows and only one eye. It also had ten swords inserted into its body. Its sword attacks were also extremely fast and ruthless…</p><p>In terms of ‘sword’, it seemed to be the favorite of the Way of the Sword. It was the natural son of the sword and was extremely strong.</p><p>Of course, in front of that person, even a special sword spirit like the Sword Demon, who could be contracted by the Red Ghost Inscription was at a disadvantage.</p><p>“Baz… Hun… ‘an…”</p><p>Elder Han spoke in an extremely weak voice. This was also the last desperate cry that indicated his desire to live.</p><p>“Sizzle.”</p><p>The sword in the Sword Demon’s palm only managed to nick the skin on Elder Han’s neck. The red blood oozed out a little before it stopped.</p><p>Even though it slashed downward at such a high speed, it could still retract freely. If it wanted to stop the sword, it would stop. If it wanted to spare someone’s life, it would spare someone’s life.</p><p>The Sword Demon grabbed the extremely weak Elder Han with one hand and pulled him out.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>Elder Han only felt that the broken sword that had pierced through his entire body had brought about a terrifying secondary injury. His entire body was in so much pain that it twitched and convulsed.</p><p>That familiar excruciating pain was like a knife that cut slowly through his wounds and prevented his injuries from healing.</p><p>“You know Bazhun’an?” The Sword Demon lifted the drooping Elder Han and tilted its head and sounded surprised.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was unsure of what Elder Han had said just now. He even hesitated as he rushed up to stop him.</p><p>When he saw the savage Sword Demon stop its decapitation action and uttered that familiar name without any restraint, Xu Xiaoshou was almost certain about some of his previous guesses.</p><p>Elder Han was one of the Bazhun’an’s ‘men’ and was one of their backup plans!</p><p>From the looks of it, the fact that he had come to exchange for the secondary plane door meant that the secondary plane door had fallen into the hands of an enemy faction. Most likely it was the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>“This person is useful. We can’t kill him.” Xu Xiaoshou turned to look at Gu Qingyi.</p><p>“Senior Sword Demon!” Gu Qingyi hurriedly called out. “Please spare his life! He’s of great use!”</p><p>The Sword Demon silently glanced at Gu Qingyi.</p><p>Gu Qingyi felt his scalp go numb.</p><p>To be honest, Gu Qingyi didn’t want to summon the Sword Demon if he could.</p><p>By borrowing the power of the Red Ghost Inscription, just like how he had used it against Jiang Buyi, he could use a little of Senior Sword Demon’s power. This way, he would not hurt innocent people, nor would it cause any other accidents.</p><p>The Sword Demon was simply too savage!</p><p>It was the last life-saving method given by his Supreme Master, Wen Ting. It was a special sword spirit that was unique to the Burial Sword Tomb. It was born from a combination of the resentment of countless broken swords, and the famed sword.</p><p>Before this, the Sword Demon had followed his Supreme Master, Wen Ting, around the marital arts world.</p><p>Since ancient times, only three sword spirits had been born in the Burial Sword Tomb.</p><p>The oldest one was said to have been contracted by Old Man You Tu and was called the Sword Elder.</p><p>In recent times, other than his Supreme Master Wen Ting, who had signed a contract with the Red Ghost Inscription, the only one who had passed it to him was his good friend, Bazhun’an, and the other Sword Demon who had signed a contract with Bazhun’an.</p><p>These two Sword Demons were almost like twin brothers. They were born at the same time and grew up together. In the end, they assisted their Supreme Master and the Eighth Sword Deity respectively before the two of them split up and went their different ways.</p><p>Gu Qingi knew about the origins of the Sword Demon and knew that it was a ferocious monster from the previous era that only his Supreme Master, Wen Ting, could control.</p><p>Ever since he left the Burial Sword Tomb, he had never thought of using it as his own combat strength.</p><p>However, when the great array of Zhen Huang Palace broke, the ice-type Demi-Saint wanted to kill the Ancient Swordsman without any second thoughts.</p><p>Gu Qingyi did not know which Ancient Swordsman had injured this madman, so he hated all of them.</p><p>However, there were only a few Ancient Swordsman in this world. How could they be that easily bullied?</p><p>Gu Qingyi was furious, especially when he saw that his Second Junior Brother was going all out to defend them to death to cover the rear. Without saying another word, he released his strongest combat strength instantly.</p><p>You’re an ice-type Demi-Saint, aren’t you?</p><p>I, the Sword Demon was the protector during my Supreme Master’s era.</p><p>If you can defeat me, you can kill the brothers of the Gu Clan and us the Ancient Swordsman!</p><p>This was great.</p><p>The moment the Sword Demon appeared, Elder Han was almost instantly killed.</p><p>However, when Elder Han uttered Bazhun’an’s name before he died, Gu Qingyi was similarly stunned.</p><p>Who in the Eastern Region’s Holy Sword Land didn’t know of the Eighth Sword Deity?</p><p>Moreover, for the Burial Sword Tomb, this name had another layer of meaning.</p><p>Strictly speaking, with the relationship between his Supreme Master Wen Ting and the Eighth Sword Deity, if Gu Qingyi really met Bazhun’an, he would even have to address him as Uncle-Master.</p><p>Wen Ting and Bazhun’an were said to be sworn brothers!</p><p>“Who are you? You know Bazhun’an?”</p><p>Gu Qingyi asked with some reservations.</p><p>He didn’t know if this crazy Demi-Saint was a friend or foe, so he didn’t expose his relationship with the Eighth Sword Deity.</p><p>However, Gu Qinger, the recorder behind him, came online. With the same tone, the same expression, but different wording, he said.</p><p>“Who are you? You know my Eighth Martial Uncle?”</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Elder Han, who had been flung off the Sword Demon’s hand, collapsed to the ground. His entire body was as stiff as an ice sculpture, and only his pupils trembled violently.</p><p>What did he say?</p><p>Eighth… Eighth Martial Uncle?</p><p>These two were the devil’s… Martial Nephews?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
