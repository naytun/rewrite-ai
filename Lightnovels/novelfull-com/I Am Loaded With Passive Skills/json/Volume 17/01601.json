(2)</p><p>The second true body was silent.</p><p>“F*ck you!”</p><p>After he cursed, he took the easy way out and ran off. He ran so quickly that not even his shadow could be seen, for fear that he would be caught.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t angry. He just looked at the void.</p><p>Vision sharing was special, especially when the second true body also had ‘Perception’.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was used to seeing people from his ‘Perception’, so he didn’t feel uncomfortable now. At most, he felt that the range of his ‘Perception’ had expanded.</p><p>He was already able to control his focus very well. He could decide when he wanted to watch and when he didn’t want to watch. He could switch between them at will, and he could multitask.</p><p>The second true body was a lazy fellow, and its cultivation level realm would not exceed the main body’s.</p><p>After such a long period of comprehension, Xu Xiaoshou discovered that the second true body knew the Breathing Technique. However, it was difficult for him to make a breakthrough, and it would not follow the main body to make a breakthrough.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that after he broke through to the Sovereign Stage, he would have to kill this second true body and create another.</p><p>It was because he constantly improved his state and after the second true body appeared, it was basically in a stagnant state and could not keep up with the cultivation progress of the main body.</p><p>“I don’t know how far apart he can be from me, and if there are any limitations.” Xu Xiaoshou pondered.</p><p>If there were no distance limit, the second true body could be thrown to the Central Region or the Southern Region. With this vision sharing, the true body could switch at any time and travel at any time.</p><p>However, he couldn’t exchange any treasures, and he had lesser life-saving trump cards.</p><p>But it didn’t matter. He just had to exchange his life for it. The second true body might suffer losses, but the main body would never suffer any loss.</p><p>There was too much fun in this!</p><p>When he realized that the second true body was basically independent, Xu Xiaoshou felt that the ‘distance limit’ probably didn’t exist.</p><p>Of course, he wasn’t sure yet. He could only verify it with practice.</p><p>“Ye Xiao…”</p><p>“Five Decays of Heaven and Man…”</p><p>These two names echoed in his mind, and Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts ran continuously.</p><p>In the end, he even distanced himself from this matter, all so that he would not have to make a move and leave traces that would be discovered by the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>This kind of ‘protection’ was heartwarming.</p><p>But not knowing the intention behind it would always make one feel cold.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s plot was not simple.</p><p>“He knew that he had only killed a puppet. He knew that Ye Xiao was not dead. He should have had more ways to find Ye Xiao’s body in the wilderness space-time, but he stopped all his actions and let Ye Xiao appear.”</p><p>“It’s obvious that he’s trying to protect me… Even if I’m a fool, I would think so.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his temples and tried to raise his thoughts to another level.</p><p>He pondered about this strange matter from the point of a chess player and thought about the second meaning behind the move made by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>“He was very certain that Ye Xiao would die, and she would die an unnatural death… Yes, after being infused by the Qi of decay, Ye Xiao shouldn’t be able to escape. Even if she could, she would have died unexpectedly.”</p><p>“So, he wants to… kill Ye Xiao on his own?”</p><p>“This is too ruthless. He’s a little too conceited… Ye Xiao’s ability is not simple. At the very least, the God of Death that I saw in the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes had not even been released when her body died. Ye Xiao must have a trump card.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou broke out in a cold sweat, but he felt that his guess was not wrong.</p><p>“So why?”</p><p>“Five Decays of Heaven and Man, what’s on your mind? Are you avoiding me so you can kill Ye Xiao on your own?”</p><p>He couldn’t figure it out…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t even figure out why the Five Decays of Heaven and Man wanted to protect him, so how could he figure out the deeper meaning of his actions?</p><p>Since he couldn’t figure it out, then he wouldn’t think about it.</p><p>Anyway, the second true body had been dispatched.</p><p>Traces of a higher void battle were evident everywhere.</p><p>Even if the Five Decays of Heaven and Man used the space-time golden talisman, as long as he got close, his second true body would be able to find the specific location by relying on the space attributes.</p><p>When the time came to personally watch the battle, everything would come to light.</p><p>Death countdown: Four days!</p><p>When he glanced at the countdown in his mind, Xu Xiaoshou knew that he had no time to waste.</p><p>The premise of all trouble was to stay alive.</p><p>With Master Siren and Xiao Kongtong by his side, the death countdown of ten to eight days did not feel like much.</p><p>They were not in a hurry, and neither was he.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, there was only a ‘four’ left on the countdown. This was too ominous!</p><p>“I have to find the main palace. If this drags on, I’ll really die in this desolate place.”</p><p>“Jiang Buyi could not kill me, and Ye Xiao could not kill me. With this broken countdown, you want me, the number one genius of the Saint Servant to die in the First Hall of Sins?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou became nervous. He tried to choose a path, but he still didn’t know which direction to go.</p><p>Because of the battle between the Saint Calamity and the Demi-Saint, the First Hall of Sins was in ruins. The labyrinth had been blasted into numerous paths that led in all directions.</p><p>As for Rao Yaoyao and Elder Han, they seemed to have fought their way out of the First Hall of Sins. In any case, with the hall being so isolated, they couldn’t even hear the thunder from the Saint Calamity.</p><p>He didn’t know if it would end with Elder Han’s death or Rao Yaoyao’s defeat…</p><p>In the vast labyrinth, to locate the main hall was a problem when one could not find the way, but it was also a problem when there were too many roads.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought about it for a while and decided to imitate Xiao Kongtong’s ability. He used his Drawing Expertise to draw countless tiny moths to explore the way in every direction.</p><p>It had to be said that this method of elimination was the most tiring, but it was also the most effective way to locate the way.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
