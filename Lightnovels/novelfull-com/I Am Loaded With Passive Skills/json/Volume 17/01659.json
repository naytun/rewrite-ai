There were too many things involved.</p><p>When the battle was halfway through, Xu Xiaoshou discovered that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had a Ghost Beast host body. He had evil intentions towards Ye Xiao who plotted against him.</p><p>He felt that the trouble had become bigger and was somewhat out of control.</p><p>In the end, another variable came. It turned out that Jiang Buyi and Yu Lingdi had already joined forces. Yu Lingdi had watched the entire battle from the beginning to the end.</p><p>This was no longer a matter of whether it was a big problem or not.</p><p>The nature of this fight had directly changed. It had been lifted from the shadows to the surface.</p><p>Open card game!</p><p>Yama colluded with the Ghost Beast and this would not end well. However, there was no need for Xu Xiaoshou to bother about this. After all, it was not his business.</p><p>What mattered was because Yu Lingdi had watched the entire scene. This meant that the Holy Divine Palace would be totally aware of the God Devil Eyes. The Ultimate Life Demon Physique could probably not be kept a secret anymore.</p><p>The only thing to rejoice about was that Mu Zixi’s identity was exposed, but not Mu Xiaogong’s.</p><p>Mu Zixi was the Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou’s little junior sister. She had the word ‘death’ written on her head, so she wouldn’t feel any burden if another one came along.</p><p>But in fact, there was not too much difference between Mu Zixi and Mu Xiaogong.</p><p>He thought about it and realized that the First Pavilion in the Sky would definitely be lost.</p><p>Now, he hoped that everything that Yu Lingdi had discovered in the First Hall of Sins would not spread beyond the Abyss Island.</p><p>Don’t let anything happen to those people in the Yunlun Mountain Range.</p><p>Mo Mo should be fine.</p><p>However, Xiao Wanfeng and Xu Xiaoji… Xu Xiaoshou was very worried about these two.</p><p>“Yu Lingdi currently can’t attend to the outside for now!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried his best to comfort himself.</p><p>But in actual fact, he couldn’t even protect himself now.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man had exposed his trump cards. His Ghost Beast host body, the Three Loathsome Eyes and all his other unknown attempts against Ye Xiao.</p><p>Yu Lingdi had also revealed his trump cards. The secondary plane door was in his hands. He had joined forces with Jiang Buyi to save Ye Xiao.</p><p>Mu Zixi had also revealed her trump cards. She revealed her explosive powers. This lady had the Ultimate Life Demon Physique, was the possessor of the God Devil Eyes, and was the Lei family’s orphan. So what of it?</p><p>These people and things that should have been hidden had all surfaced because of this battle.</p><p>Actually, it should have surfaced a long time ago!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wouldn’t blame his junior sister because she exposed herself.</p><p>He knew that he could not hide for long.</p><p>It was all thanks to Rao Yaoyao and Bazhun’an that they were able to hide in the Yunlun Mountain Range.</p><p>However, it would protect him only for a while, but not forever.</p><p>He couldn’t possibly allow his junior sister to spend her entire life growing flowers and trees in the Yuan Mansion, right?</p><p>Therefore, this thing could only be delayed as much as possible so that little junior sister could gain more experience and grow up quickly.</p><p>This was also one of the reasons why she was released from the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>Since both sides had already made their cards clear, his choice became extremely important!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou only revealed his name and a second true body.</p><p>Strictly speaking, the ones that appeared on the battlefield were less than one-tenth of his trump cards.</p><p>Therefore, he only allowed his second true body to act once against the secondary plane door-just once!</p><p>He failed once.</p><p>Yu Lingdi even appeared.</p><p>He quickly had his second true body retreat.</p><p>Did Bazhun’an allow him to seize the secondary plane door? No!</p><p>Did Yu Lingdi snatching back Ye Xiao have anything to do with him? It didn’t matter much!</p><p>At this point, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man should have gone to fight with Yu Lingdi. Why would he want to enter and blindly interfere?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was always clear-headed.</p><p>His goal was to find little junior sister and bring her with him in order to minimize the danger.</p><p>However, he would never be so stupid as to not take the wages of a Saint Servant; he did not want to join Yama and even risk his life to help Bazhun’an to do something that was not even a mission. What’s more, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, whose enemies were still unknown, tried desperately to snatch Ye Xiao, although he also wanted to kill Ye Xiao.</p><p>Therefore…</p><p>After the first move, the second true body retreated.</p><p>The battle was supposed to be a bloody battle between the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and Yu Lingdi. What was the point if he exposed himself?</p><p>His second true body did indeed have the Sword Will. He could have used the Present Gods and Buddhas on Yu Lingdi and it would definitely have worked!</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was in a wilted state.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s combat strength was at its peak.</p><p>The second true body was the same as Yu Lingdi. It had not been exposed for a long time and was also at its peak.</p><p>However, even if the Present Gods and Buddhas killed Yu Lingdi, what was the use?</p><p>The one on the battlefield was only one of Yu Ling’s water-type Clone. If one of them died, there were still tens of millions of them.</p><p>If he couldn’t get the secondary plane door, it would not be a good thing if he exposed his trump card… Instead, it would make Yu Lingdi pay more attention to the Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“As long as I stay in the dark, everything can be done!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou remembered everyone and tried his best to grasp the movements of every chess piece in the First Hall of Sins, regardless if they were friend or foe.</p><p>The only thing he could think of now was to sneak out of the battle.</p><p>In any case, little junior sister had already run away. If he continued to run, he would not be able to catch up to his own people in this battle.</p><p>Even his main body had brought Elder Han to the battlefield out of desperation, just to prevent any accidents.</p><p>If nothing unexpected happened at that time, and Yu Lingdi happened to be alone, he could kick the dog when it was down. However, Xu Xiaoshou would not expose too much.</p><p>He firmly believed that Yu Lingdi was also a chess piece. The Demi-Saints of the Holy Divine Palace had not shown up.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao… Dao Qiongcang would also send at least two or three Demi-Saints, or even four or five!</p><p>Moreover, Bazhun’an had yet to make a move, and not even a shadow of the Saint Servant could be seen.</p><p>Why would he risk it all?</p><p>Was he in a rush to reincarnate?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s plan was perfect.</p><p>He felt that he was about to leave the battlefield. No one could stop Yu Lingdi and Ye Xiao was about to leave the battlefield as well.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
