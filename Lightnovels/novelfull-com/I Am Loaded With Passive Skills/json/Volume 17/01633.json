You’re merely something to be sacrificed. When you lose your usefulness and get held back by Demi-Saint Rao, even Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison can’t save you. For the sake of the big picture, he would only abandon you, and you would die an unnatural death.”</p><p>Abandon?</p><p>Elder Han seemed to understand.</p><p>This was not the kind of chess he played, but he understood Chen Tan’s analogy.</p><p>“Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison gave up on you because you couldn’t exchange the secondary door plane. It was exchanged by someone a day ago.”</p><p>Elder Han was shocked.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was calm.</p><p>“Fortunately, I reappeared. It’s both fate and coincidence.”</p><p>“You met me. Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison treated you as a gift to be given to me in order to form a good relationship with me and please me.”</p><p>“But I don’t want to use you in this way, so I’ll make everything clear to you.”</p><p>That dog thief…</p><p>F*ck him!</p><p>Elder Han was already furious that he was being used as a gift without his knowledge.</p><p>“You’ve already seen it. Great Infernal Ancestor had taken a fancy to me. Seven Trees Emperor is secretly attached to me. Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison tried to curry favor with me…”</p><p>“When I was at the Innate Stage, I fought to the death with Feng Yujin and made him submit. Now, he is a minor guest of the First Pavilion in the Sky under my name.”</p><p>“When I was still at the Master Stage, I joined forces with Patriarch Wuji and used his great array to behead the Chief of the six divisions from the Holy Divine Palace by myself. He was a Higher Void.”</p><p>“Bazhun’an saw that my sword body was extraordinary and wanted to teach me swordsmanship. I didn’t agree and only accepted his command token and with great reluctance helped him clean up the mess of the Saint Servant.”</p><p>“Seven Sword Deity Mei Siren concealed his sentiment and taught me sword techniques. I saw through it and didn’t say anything; I wanted to preserve his dignity, so I just learned a little.”</p><p>“Rumor has it that the Eighth Sword Deity is a Three-breaths for innate stage, three years for Sword Deity. I dismissed the rumors and learned the sword in one night and mastered both sword techniques. This was unprecedented.”</p><p>At this point, Xu Xiaoshou continued to speak confidently. However, he no longer suppressed the aura in his body. He broke through the Stealth and his Master Stage cultivation level erupted totally.</p><p>“I’m now at the Master Stage Star Worship state . I’ve reached the peak but have not reached the Sovereign Stage yet. I’ve made countless achievements and can easily defeat a Demi-Saint.”</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao, who cut off one of your arms, I once messed about with her in the Yunlun Mountain Range, but she had not realized it yet.”</p><p>“I also dallied with Jiang Buyi, who was also a Demi-Saint, in the Forest of Miracles. He did the dirty work for me and decapitated Teng Shanhai. Thus the Holy Divine Palace suffered a setback.”</p><p>“The Master Stage will be the Sovereign Stage of the future. ‘The chick knows the ambition of the swan.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou bent down, his face calm as if these achievements had not been created by a Master Stage like him. It was as if he had turned the legends into new ones to fool others.</p><p>“What do you want to ask…”</p><p>Elder Han was completely dumbfounded.</p><p>He still didn’t know if Chen Tan spoke the truth.</p><p>It could be seen that even though his expression was indifferent, he did not seem to be weak.</p><p>However, how could such a great feat be achieved by a mere Master Stage? However, when he saw Chen Tan’s cultivation level…</p><p>In the past, he couldn’t see through it and thought he was a Higher Void.</p><p>Now that he exposed it, he was undoubtedly a Master Stage!</p><p>When this guy was a Master Stage, he had already confronted Ye Xiao and Rao Yaoyao in the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes?</p><p>He really dared! He really seemed to be able to do what he said!</p><p>“Get up.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shouted.</p><p>Elder Han stood up shakily.</p><p>“I want to ask you, if the Holy Emperor dared to bet on me, do you have the guts to bet on me?”</p><p>At this moment, Elder Han’s mind exploded and he felt dazed.</p><p>He looked out at the misty emptiness and felt that the young man in front of him seemed to have grown into a giant.</p><p>He stood on the peak of the world and looked down on the world. His body was surrounded by the aura of a dragon. Now, he could achieve all this so easily.</p><p>In the future, when there was an actual storm, he would definitely rise up and become the second Bazhun’an…</p><p>No!</p><p>Perhaps, he would even surpass Bazhun’an!</p><p>“I, I, I…”</p><p>Elder Han was at a loss. He felt that this was a very good opportunity, but he did not know what to do.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at him calmly. He held his hands behind his back, thrust out his chest, and raised his chin slightly.</p><p>“If you’ve thought it through, then kneel down.”</p><p>“This time around, you are no longer bowing to Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison, nor are you bowing to Bazhun’an. Instead, you are bowing to Chen Tan, the person standing in front of you… The only one in the world!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
