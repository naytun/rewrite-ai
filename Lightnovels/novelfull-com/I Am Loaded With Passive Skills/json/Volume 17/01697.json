(5)</p><p>After the thunder struck, without hesitation, Rao Yaoyao raised her sword and charged into the saint calamity, completely forgetting her original intention of coming.</p><p>Yu Lingdi closed his eyes in silence.</p><p>He remembered that last time Rao Yaoyao had shouldered her own saint calamity and chased after someone. This time, she had become a Saint, but she was shouldering someone else’s saint calamity and chasing after someone.</p><p>Is this what it means to be an ancient swordsman?</p><p>The position of the calamity cloud can change, and so can the person being attacked. But the one raising the sword can only be me?</p><p>It was too f*cking ridiculous and completely unreasonable!</p><p>However, in his impression…</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao doesn’t seem to be such a person. Who provoked her?”</p><p>…</p><p>“Who would do something like that?”</p><p>“I was almost crippled!”</p><p>In the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion, Xu Xiaoshou, who had completely forgotten about everything in the outside world, was focused on dealing with the chaotic energy reserve in his body.</p><p>Of course, the trigger of the sin was the cup of ‘Saint Wine’.</p><p>Fortunately, Xu Xiaoshou was still able to hold on.</p><p>He was a master at dealing with chaos. There were many sacred objects in the energy reserve that were tamed by him.</p><p>However, the mastermind behind the scenes suddenly stretched out the curtain and gave himself another slap. This was unbearable.</p><p>After being slapped by the Bazhun’an, Xu Xiaoshou felt as if the sword cognition in his body was blown up.</p><p>It was completely out of control. It was so excited like a baby who had been forced to sleep for three days and three nights. It was full of energy!</p><p>First, it led to the riots of spiritual sources and holy essences in the energy resource.</p><p>Following that, it provoked a battle between Infernal Original Seed, Three Days Frozen Calamity, Little Blue Flower of the Tranquil Lake, and others.</p><p>Even the white bead of the wretched saint and the sword cognition of Uncle…um, Xiao Kongtong were also involved in the game.</p><p>“Clearly, this is the sword cognition I cultivated!”</p><p>Xu Xiao felt extremely wronged. This was something that he had seriously cultivated according to the “Sword Observing Classic”…</p><p>Uh.</p><p>Wait a minute.</p><p>The Sword Observation Manual?</p><p>He seemed to have suddenly found the reason!</p><p>“Damn it, Bazhun’an, when I succeed in my cultivation in the future, I’ll definitely stab your heart with Fourth Sword!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou made a silent vow.</p><p>Without any preparation, he entered the time to break through to the Sovereign Dao Realm.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The energy reserve started to explode.</p><p>His spirit exploded.</p><p>His Soul Intent and whatnot weren’t vague either. They all wanted to interfere and explode.</p><p>The only thing Xu Xiaoshou felt was that his brain was buzzing. The world suddenly turned blank, and he became a Chaotic Mist in his Yuan Mansion world.</p><p>Everything started from nothing.</p><p>“Dao!”</p><p>The silence seemed to have lasted for ten thousand years.</p><p>Other than this ‘Dao’, there was nothing else in the blank.</p><p>It was not a sound, it was shapeless, it was not something tangible, but it existed.</p><p>It was like a thought, a subjective conjecture by humans, but it truly existed.</p><p>This was the ‘Dao’ of the Sovereign Stage!</p><p>This realm was the “Dao Realm” of the Sovereign Stage!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hadn’t truly broken through the Sovereign Dao Realm yet and was stuck at the edge. However, he was also suffocated by this so-called ‘Dao’.</p><p>He knew that if he forcefully occupied the ‘Dao’ of the world, he could only die in the ‘Dao’ if he did not break through!</p><p>And yet…</p><p>He was completely unprepared!</p><p>“Pfft.”</p><p>At this moment, there were two strange sounds, and a white flame suddenly flashed into the blankness.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was like a drowning man who had grabbed onto a life-saving straw. He had grasped onto the fire-type Great Path that had ‘led’ him into the world of Spiritual Cultivation in the beginning.</p><p>The world had warmed up.</p><p>Lava flowed under his feet, and volcanoes erupted behind him. Everything became warm and intimate.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The sword hummed.</p><p>This was to make his reputation rise in the Windcloud Competition and allowed him to become renowned throughout the world.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grabbed the Wat of the Sword, and it transformed into a twisted Hitten Bitter in his hand.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The giant that he had seen in the Swallow the Mountains and Rivers fantasy realm had come alive!</p><p>It had actually grown to look like him, a Berserk Giant with an Exploding Posture, feasting on its back, surrounded by a Close-bounds Force Field that disappeared from time to time. After taking the easy way out, it reappeared in front of him.</p><p>At a certain moment, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had become Master Siren, and this giant was his sword image!</p><p>“Come.”</p><p>He embraced the giant and accepted it. He immediately felt his muscles splitting and the world shrinking.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had become a giant!</p><p>“What else?”</p><p>“Bring it on!”</p><p>The giant Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand and did not reject anyone.</p><p>t turned out that he had long been prepared. The Master Stage and the Dao he had comprehended before were all prepared for this moment.</p><p>Spiritual Cultivators had always been prepared for this moment!</p><p>Countless Great Paths came one after another.</p><p>The Path of Weaving, the Path of Painting, the Path of Cooking… All of the Daos that were more or less related to Spiritual Cultivation were here.</p><p>Not only his own, but some had been plundered. Metal element, Dissolve, spirit, soul…</p><p>“Oh, so I’ve come into contact with so many Great Paths before?”</p><p>The giant Xu Xiaoshou had various colors wrapped around his hand and held a strange-shaped object.</p><p>He suddenly fell into deep thought.</p><p>“Maybe too many choices will only confuse me. I need to figure out what I really need.”</p><p>He suddenly cast aside everything, leaving only the giant’s body, the Hidden Bitter in his hand, and the fire on the sword to carefully comprehend.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The energy reserve rose and the spiritual source surged.</p><p>Path energy diffused and overflowed in all directions.</p><p>In the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion, Bazhun’an and Kong Yuhen looked in amazement at Xu Xiaoshou, who was sitting cross-legged with his eyes closed. An Ice Lotus suddenly appeared under his feet, surrounded by white flames. A green flower burned on his head.</p><p>The Hidden Bitter had slipped out of nowhere and curled up around Xu Xiaoshou’s neck, coiled into several layers. It was so comfortable that he moaned, trembled, and gasp for breath under the nourishment of the aura of path energy.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
