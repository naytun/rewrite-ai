(2)</p><p>The Bazhun’an laughed loudly and downed the wine in one gulp. They put down their cups and said, “How can he not be anxious at his age?”</p><p>“But when you first arrived, you seemed very relaxed?”</p><p>“I’m different. This isn’t the first time I’ve entered your All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion.”</p><p>Listening to this conversation, Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have gained some enlightenment.</p><p>He quickly walked to the wooden table and sat down, looking at Kong Yuhen.</p><p>“You guys don’t know each other?”</p><p>“Nice to meet you.”</p><p>Kong Yuhen warmed the wine stove and replied with a smile, ” In the past, we really didn’t know each other.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the Bazhun’an.</p><p>“You know each other!”</p><p>“Yes.” The Bazhun’an smiled and nodded.</p><p>If Mu Zixi or Elder Han were here, they would probably be confused by now.</p><p>They were essentially the same question, but the two people in front of him gave completely different answers.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered to himself.</p><p>He remembered what Kong Yuhen had said when he first came here. He had forgotten many things.</p><p>“You lost your memory?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>Kong Yuhen nodded and then shook his head.</p><p>“Perhaps…”</p><p>“You must have lost your memory!” Xu Xiaoshou felt that this was the truth and asked, ” Why?”</p><p>“Why…” Kong Yuhen lowered his eyes and remained silent.</p><p>After a long time, he raised his head and said slowly, “Actually, this is the question I wanted to ask you when you first arrived, but at that time, you only wanted to leave.”</p><p>Ah, this.</p><p>It was really awkward…</p><p>So Kong Yuhen really couldn’t remember anything about his past?</p><p>Even Master Siren and the others can’t see or enter the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion, but I can…</p><p>Therefore, in the perception of Kong Yuhen, I should be the one who could give him the “answer”.</p><p>He thinks that I’m very strong!</p><p>But I just wanted to run…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou understood and looked at the Bazhun’an. “Maybe he can give you an answer. He’s best at giving answers to others.”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>This time, the Bazhun’an rejected him very straightforwardly, ” I can’t give it to you.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the person beside him and saw that Kong Yuhen was hesitant to speak. He asked on behalf of Kong Yuhen without any curiosity, “Why?”</p><p>Bazhun’an lifted his cup and poured wine into the cup in front of Xu Xiaoshou. They glanced at Kong Yuhen and said, “Because the previous you had already asked me this question, and I still haven’t found the answer.”</p><p>Kong Yuhen began to ponder in silence.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was holding a wine glass, but his knuckles seemed to be stiff and he could not use any strength.</p><p>The last you…</p><p>Ha, this is too f*cking interesting!</p><p>What is everyone talking about? Why can’t I understand it?</p><p>The Bazhun’an seemed to have noticed Xu Xiaoshou’s confusion and explained to Kong Yuhen, “We are not meeting for the first time.”</p><p>“When I first met you, I hadn’t even started learning swordsmanship. At that time, I was still in the secular world…Yes, imperial examination.”</p><p>“Wen Ting and I were fighting in a small alley. When we returned to the inn, we inexplicably walked into this place.”</p><p>The Bazhun’an pointed at the floor of All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion and said firmly, “At that time, you were in a similar state as you are now. You didn’t know anything and wanted to find him.”</p><p>“Wen Ting chatted with you for a long time, but I only listened.”</p><p>“In the end, he invited you to Burial Sword Tomb to see a doctor. He said that maybe Elder You Tu knows something.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held his wine glass and listened attentively.</p><p>However, before he could drink it, he choked on his saliva.</p><p>“Cough cough!”</p><p>“Sorry, I have to interrupt.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his hand in embarrassment. “Elder You Tu? What’s his relationship with Burial Sword Tomb?”</p><p>Kong Yuhen was also listening. This information was very important to him.</p><p>He discovered that when this person called the Bazhun’an was following him alone, even if he looked relaxed, he was actually still a little vigilant.</p><p>However, after the arrival of the young man Xu Xiaoshou, he was willing to tell many stories that he had not told before.</p><p>Perhaps, he was not telling it to him.</p><p>Instead, he used the excuse of telling it to himself to tell the young man.</p><p>“You Tu…”</p><p>The Bazhun’an sighed, “He is Wen Ting’s master’s master’s…Hmm, something like a Martial Granduncle. I forgot the details. Anyway, he was once the “tomb keeper” of a Burial Sword Tomb, but at that time, his reputation was not prominent.”</p><p>The tomb keeper was similar to the Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace or the palace master of the Xu Yue Grey Palace. In any case, he was the number one figure in the Burial Sword Tomb.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew this name.</p><p>This was because the Seven Sword Deity Wen Ting was the tomb keeper of the current Burial Sword Tomb!</p><p>However, knowing this was one thing. After he truly understood the relationship between Elder You Tu, Wen Ting, and the Bazhun’an, he was shocked to realize that the ancient swordsmen were a family!</p><p>After all this, there was actually a connection.</p><p>Hmm, that’s true … Ancient Sword Techniques had declined in the current era, and those who could continue to carry them forward had to have a teacher, right?</p><p>Even when they were teaching the sword, they didn’t ask for a master’s name like Master Siren.</p><p>However, over time, this person taught that person, and I learned it for you to comprehend. If you really wanted to straighten things out, you could always pull some connections.</p><p>The main thing was …</p><p>Elder You Tu was once the tomb keeper of the Burial Sword Tomb! This was very important.</p><p>No wonder he was close to the Bazhun’an and left behind the legend of the former Hallmaster of the Seven Swords in the Holy Divine Palace on the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>“Continue.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt like he was here to listen to a story.</p><p>Even the matter of breaking through had become dispensable.</p><p>The battle in the First Hall of Sins should still be ongoing, but after figuring out Kong Yuhen’s goal, he was shocked.</p><p>This All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion suddenly had that kind of magic!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
