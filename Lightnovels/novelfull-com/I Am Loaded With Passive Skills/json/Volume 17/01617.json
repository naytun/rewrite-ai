(1)</h1><p>1617 The Master of Void Island, the Door of the Secondary Plane! (1)</p><p>“Death Exemption Token… 50… Void Crystals…”</p><p>After the giant statue’s intermittent voice came out, Xu Xiaoshou’s expression froze.</p><p>50…</p><p>I only have 35 Void Crystals in total!</p><p>He didn’t think that after all the careful calculations, he would not have enough money…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already made up his mind to buy the Death Exemption Token. After the death countdown was lifted, he would directly make his escape. He would look for his little junior sister first and then leave this dangerous vortex together with her.</p><p>But who would have thought…</p><p>“Can I pay on credit?” Xu Xiaoshou raised his head with a last trace of hope.</p><p>“So, you give me the Death Exemption Token first, and I’ll give you a portion of the Void Crystals. I will pay up the rest later?” Xu Xiaoshou took out a full stack of Void Crystals.</p><p>With a loud clatter, Xu Xiaoshou took out all the Void Crystals he had.</p><p>He would return with the balance in all sincerity to make up for the shortfall.</p><p>The giant statue didn’t say anything. It didn’t even count the Void Crystals.</p><p>The last person who wanted to pay on credit had already gone out to do something exceptional merely for two Void Crystals. How could it break the rules and make an exception?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face darkened as he mulled over the possibility if he were to take it by force.</p><p>Gu Qingyi glanced at the pile of black hexagonal crystals in Brother Chen’s hands and remained silent. He had never seen such a thing before, so even if he wanted to, he couldn’t help now.</p><p>Gu Qinger, on the other hand, fell into deep thought as he looked at the pile of Void Crystals.</p><p>“Brother Chen, don’t you have enough?” he asked.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at him blankly; What’s with this nonsense? If I had enough, would I be in such a dazed state?</p><p>“I have some!” Gu Qinger slapped his thigh and took out a black hexagonal crystal from his spatial ring. He compared it to the one in Brother Chen’s hand…</p><p>Hey! Was this a coincidence or what? It was identical!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment and then was overjoyed.</p><p>“How many do you need?”</p><p>“Hmm? Your tone… Oh, I still need 15. Do you have 15?”</p><p>“I think I still have quite a lot, but I don’t know what they’re for. Forget it, I’ll give them all to you!” Gu Qinger waved his hand, and a batch of Void Crystals flew out from his spatial ring.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou counted the lot.</p><p>Little chap.</p><p>You’re even richer than me!</p><p>There are a total of 70 Void Crystals!”</p><p>When it was a matter of life and death, Xu Xiaoshou would not stand on ceremony. He thanked him and took all the 70 Void Crystals.</p><p>Together with his own, there were a total of 105 Void Crystals; that was equivalent to two Death Exemption Tokens.</p><p>He would keep one for himself and give the other to his Teacher.</p><p>As for Xiao Kongtong… Well, there was no other way. He had to fend for himself.</p><p>He took out 15 Void Crystals and added them into his pile. With this large amount of wealth, Xu Xiaoshou wanted to exchange for a Death Exemption Token first.</p><p>However, he thought of something and stopped.</p><p>“Wait, why do you have so many Void Crystals?”</p><p>Gu Qinger was stumped by this question. He frowned and tilted his head as he tried to recall.</p><p>Gu Qinger stood there and tried to figure it out for a while, but he couldn’t think of an answer. It was as if he had been born with this fortune and knew that it was called the Void Crystal. He also knew that it had been in his spatial ring from the beginning.</p><p>“That’s right. Brother Chen, you make perfect sense. How could I have Void Crystals?”</p><p>Gu Qingyi’s eyes narrowed when he heard that. This was quite an unusual matter. “Brother Chen, how does one get this Void Crystal?”</p><p>“Either carry out the mission given by the Void Attendant and get one or two at a time, or kill…” Xu Xiaoshou paused and glanced at the indifferent giant statue. He continued, “Kill the Void Attendant and rob it!”</p><p>“My junior brother can only delay the Void Attendant at most. He can’t kill him.” Gu Qingyi was very certain about this.</p><p>“Then he must have completed 35 jobs…” Xu Xiao Shou spoke without thinking.</p><p>D*mn!</p><p>He had accepted the Void Attendant’s mission and Lei Xi’er had been with him. That was why the reward was two Void Crystals.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, one could only get one Void Crystal for one mission.</p><p>Therefore, Gu Qinger did not do anything on the Abyss Island. He only accepted missions and killed the Higher Void.</p><p>Within a few days, he had killed a total of 70 Higher Voids!</p><p>Was this rubbish or what?</p><p>Gu Qingyi thought so too.</p><p>He scanned his junior brother from head to toe, but did not find anything unusual on him. “Try to recall where you got your Void Crystals.”</p><p>Gu Qinger could not come up with an answer.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could tell that he was not trying to hide anything, but that he really did not know.</p><p>“Five Decays of Heaven and Man?”</p><p>This person suddenly flashed across his mind, and Xu Xiaoshou felt that this was the only answer left.</p><p>The strength of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was definitely enough to kill the Void Attendant. So after he killed and plundered the Void Crystals, he placed a portion of it on Gu Qinger?</p><p>But that didn’t make sense!</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man used Gu Qinger to the point of death.</p><p>Under such circumstances, how could he have given Gu Qinger 70 Void Crystals?</p><p>Is it because… you can’t put all your eggs in one basket?</p><p>However, with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s strength, if the basket on his side was really broken, it meant that he had met a peak Demi-Saint and died in battle.</p><p>Of course, he wouldn’t have gotten the Void Crystals from Gu Qinger, so it didn’t make sense!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was puzzled.</p><p>Gu Qinger was a little scared. He held his head and recalled with a conflicted and pained expression, “Eldest Senior Brother, I seem to have forgotten something…”</p><p>“You have indeed forgotten something.” Before Gu Qingyi could say anything, Xu Xiaoshou said seriously, “When I saved you, you were still in the hands of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, a member of Yama.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
