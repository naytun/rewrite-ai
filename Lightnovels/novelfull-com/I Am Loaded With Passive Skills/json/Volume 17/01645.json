It created a splash of light in the darkness that was like the glow of dawn.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man felt as if his soul had been struck by a heavy hammer. For a moment, even his spiritual body was almost blasted to the point of collapse. He had been caught totally off guard!</p><p>In this trance-like moment, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man understood something.</p><p>“God Devil Eyes…”</p><p>Outsiders might not be aware of this, but what Yama had studied were the Lei Family’s Eyes.</p><p>In the opening chapter of the Eyes of the World, there was a sentence about the Lei Family’s Eyes that introduced the God Devil Eyes.</p><p>“A Divine Being is immune to mind control. It is a passive defense and is not restricted by anything. This includes all the visual abilities recorded later.”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s eyeballs bulged from the attack of the God’s Fall. Blood flowed out of his seven orifices, and his head ached.</p><p>In his bloodied state, he saw Mu Zixi’s limbs turn into twisted branches that wrapped around his body.</p><p>At this moment, he understood.</p><p>So Mu Zixi had never been controlled by his Three Loathsome Eyes from the start?</p><p>Was everything that she had done just an act?</p><p>“Old thing, you still want to use your eye technique to control this lady?”</p><p>Mu Zixi was finally elated.</p><p>She had suppressed herself and held it in for so long, and watched such an exciting show… What she relied on were Lei Xi-er’s words, “Attack.”</p><p>Only when she used her actions to verify the results did Mu Zixi know the reason why she could ‘attack’:</p><p>Jiang Buyi coveted the God Devil Eyes and did not dare to hurt her.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man also coveted the God Devil Eyes and did not dare to hurt her.</p><p>Once a person had desires, flaws would soon appear. This was inevitable.</p><p>Although Mu Zixi didn’t have the ability to strategize and win a battle thousands of miles away, anyone should be quick-witted in the face of death, right?</p><p>Desperate times called for desperate measures.</p><p>When Mu Zixi was about to be caught, a perfect idea flashed across her mind…</p><p>“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”</p><p>The God Devil Eyes turned and the God’s Fall controlled the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. Mu Zixi instantly transformed into a vine and wrapped itself around the body of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>When she raised her head, she was already on the back of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>In that mouth that tried desperately to stay open but could only open a little, the bright canine teeth could be vaguely seen as it shone in the darkness.</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>It was just like how Mu Zixi couldn’t take it anymore at the Windcloud Competition and bared her mouth at Xu Xiaoshou on the stage.</p><p>At this moment, she regarded the Five Decays of Heaven and Man as the most difficult enemy to deal with. She bit the main artery on his neck.</p><p>Her four limbs turned into sharp life absorbing vines that pierced into the kidneys and thighs of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>After the Five Decays of Heaven and Man struggled to shake it off, he let out a muffled groan and felt an unbearable pain as the vines stabbed into his body.</p><p>In the next second, the vitality in his body flowed at a crazy speed towards the parasite on his back.</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man endured the collapse of his head and the spiritual source in his body surged. The decaying qi resounded with a bang, as it tried to shake off the parasite on his back.</p><p>The damage from this attack could not be considered minimal.</p><p>Mu Zixi’s four limbs that had pierced into the Five Decays of Heaven and Man were blasted off by the power of the Higher Void.</p><p>However, her mouth showed no mercy. Even though her limbs were blown into splinters, she still bit the neck of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man with all her might.</p><p>“Gu… gu… gu…”</p><p>His life force surged into her body in large waves.</p><p>Life Swallowing Wood… No, the attributes of the Ultimate Life Demon Physique seemed to have been activated.</p><p>The more Mu Zixi inhaled, the more addicted she became. Her eyes began to shine, and her face turned from pale to red.</p><p>“Oh, it seems like I forgot something?”</p><p>“Who’s talking? Well .. It’s okay, the vitality breath is so fragrant. Take another breath!”</p><p>Almost instantly, Mu Zixi’s limbs recovered and turned into vines again, and pierced into the kidneys and thighs of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>The wounds on his body had yet to heal, and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man suffered a second heavy blow that caused him to groan again.</p><p>The pain was not fatal, but the speed at which the ghost-like little girl on his back swallowed his Life force was terrifying!</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man started to droop at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p><p>He panicked.</p><p>He didn’t dare to try to shake off the vampire again.</p><p>On the contrary, his energy reserve shook, and an endless amount of decay energy together with the Life Force was sent to Mu Zixi.</p><p>If you want to suck, fine!</p><p>As long as one could withstand the aura of decay that even Ye Xiao could not withstand…</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Soon, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man sensed that something was very wrong.</p><p>This little girl’s physique was a little… No, it was too special!</p><p>The power of decay that entered her body was assimilated and turned into Life Force?</p><p>Although the assimilation was slow, the power of decay would not affect her in a short period of time even if she used the Life Force she absorbed to resist.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
