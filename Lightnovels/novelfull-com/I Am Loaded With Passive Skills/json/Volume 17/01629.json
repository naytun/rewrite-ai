His eyes were still filled with vigilance and suspicion. “If your command token was scavenged…”</p><p>With a smack, Xu Xiaoshou threw the token at him and narrowly missed Elder Han.</p><p>“I said that you’re stupid, but are you really that stupid? If Bazhun’an’s command token could be picked up by an outsider, would he still be called Bazhun’an?”</p><p>“You’re right, but just in case…”</p><p>Elder Han’s worry was not without reason.</p><p>He could reveal a little of his identity because of the The Four Pillars of Destiny Token, but it was related to the plan. If anything happened to the plan in the future because of today’s leak, he would be fully responsible.</p><p>At that time, even death would be a problem!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was furious. This guy was really stupid.</p><p>Fortunately, he still had a bottom line and would not reveal everything just because he was being threatened.</p><p>From another perspective, this seemed to be a small advantage?</p><p>“You know this, right?” Xu Xiaoshou flashed the 10 Sections of the Finger Sword.</p><p>“I do.”</p><p>“What about this?” Xu Xiaoshou flashed his sword cognition again.</p><p>The sword cognition belonged to the Penetrating Divine Senses 2.0, and had been created by Bazhun’an.</p><p>If there was anything in this world that could be used to prove the intimate relationship between himself and Bazhun’an, when the sword cognition was revealed, anyone with a discerning eye would naturally understand.</p><p>“I’ll talk, I’ll talk!”</p><p>Elder Han had clearly been screwed by this sword cognition before. Just a glance was enough to make his scalp tingle, and he no longer dared to question Chen Tan’s identity.</p><p>The two Ancient Swordsman outside were Bazhun’an’s Martial Nephews.</p><p>Could this person be Bazhun’an’s personal disciple?</p><p>It was very possible! Otherwise, why would they be together?</p><p>“The plan is actually very simple. After Divine Lord Qing Shi allowed me to leave the inner island, he only instructed me to do one thing.” Elder Han recalled.</p><p>“Run! During the process of my escape, I had to look for an opportunity to exchange for the secondary plane door. If I can get an exchange for it, I’ll be able to meet Bazhun’an very quickly. After I hand it over to him, I’ll be free… After that, as long as I escape from the Abyss Island, it will be very difficult for me to be captured again.”</p><p>This ‘escape’ had a spiritual quality.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou learned from Rao Yaoyao that the Frost Ferret’s greatest strength wasn’t its ice-type combat ability, but its ability to escape.</p><p>This guy had escaped several times before being sent to the Inner Island of the Abyss Island.</p><p>Given Elder Han’s intelligence, Divine Lord Qing Shi’s plan was tailor-made for Elder Han after careful consideration.</p><p>However…</p><p>“What if you can’t exchange for the secondary plane door?” Xu Xiaoshou asked. He knew that Elder Han might not know that the secondary plane door had already been exchanged for a day ago.</p><p>“If I can’t exchange for it, then I’m in trouble. I won’t be able to see Bazhun’an anymore. Divine Lord Qing Shi would then allow me to look for someone else.”</p><p>Then you should be in trouble… Xu Xiaoshou nodded. “Who were you looking for? ”</p><p>“I don’t know.” Elder Han shook his head blankly.</p><p>“Divine Lord Qing Shi said that that person would personally look for me.”</p><p>“If I can’t exchange for the secondary plane door, then I would be of no value at all.”</p><p>“If the person I’m looking for can find me, I might still be able to survive. If he can’t find me, I’ll just pray for good luck. If I can escape from the Abyss Island, I’ll escape as soon as possible…”</p><p>Elder Han’s expression was a little serious. He clearly believed what Divine Lord Qing Shi said.</p><p>“Is that all?” Xu Xiaoshou was surprised.</p><p>“Uh, there’s actually the second half of the sentence…” Elder Han hesitated for a moment before he said in embarrassment, “Divine Lord Qing Shi said that if you go out alone, you would still come back to the inner island after going around in circles. When the time comes, you just have to obediently accept your punishment.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>This was very reasonable!</p><p>With your intelligence and ability, once Rao Yaoyao completed her Saint level and steeled her heart to capture you, you won’t stand a chance at all.</p><p>“Brother Chen…”</p><p>Elder Han was quite smart. After he hesitated for a while, he said in a low voice. “Do you think that the person Divine Lord Qing Shi spoke about was you?”</p><p>“Eh?” Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. “What do you think?”</p><p>“I think…” Elder Han frowned and said worriedly, “To be honest, I originally thought that if I couldn’t wait for Bazhun’an, I might wait for Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?” Xiaoshou staggered and almost lost his balance.</p><p>“Yes!” Elder Han’s tone was filled with respect. “I heard that he’s Bazhun’an successor. Now, his fame has spread throughout the inner island. The White Vein’s Third Ancestor, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, and many others seem to have placed their bets on him. I wonder what he looks like. ”</p><p>Why didn’t I know about this?</p><p>I’m Xu Xiaoshou himself!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou panicked.</p><p>However, on second thought, he had the Great Infernal Ancestor’s Flame Python and the infernal power. He also had the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s Holy Emperor Dragon Scale.</p><p>Other than the Seven Trees Emperor and Divine Lord Qing Shi…</p><p>“Wait, what kind of person was Seven Trees Emperor?” Xu Xiaoshou felt like he had missed something.</p><p>“Seven Trees Emperor?” Elder Han was stunned. He didn’t know why the topic had suddenly changed, but he still answered, “Seven Trees Emperor is the spirit of the seven blood trees. He is very cruel and bloodthirsty. He is not someone to be trifled with. ”</p><p>Blood tree…</p><p>The Blood Tree’s Yin Branch…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of Cen Qiaofu first.</p><p>Then, he thought of Liu Changqing and Patriarch Wuji who was with him. The two of them had brought the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch with them and had met him at the Spirit Gem Trade Fair.</p><p>Also, Elder Xie and Ghost Granny that he had killed previously, had also obtained the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch.</p><p>“Do you know Patriarch Wuji?” Xu Xiaoshou asked again.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
