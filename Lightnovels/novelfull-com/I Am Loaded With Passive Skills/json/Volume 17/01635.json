(2)</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded and said earnestly, “In this world, other than me – I’m in the same boat as you now… Therefore, other than me, no one else is worthy of your trust, whether they are my people or not.”</p><p>“I understand.” Elder Han recovered very quickly, and in an instant, he had regained the arrogance he had when he first came out of the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded and thought for a moment before he asked, “If you received orders from Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison, Bazhun’an and myself at the same time, whose orders would you carry out?”</p><p>“Yours.” Elder Han didn’t even need to think about it. If he wanted to follow the dragon, he had to have the mentality of the dragon. His transformation was now that of the standard protectors mode. He wanted to witness Lord Chen Tan’s growth!</p><p>“You are wrong.” Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and said.</p><p>“The Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison will not issue orders that go against Bazhun’an, just like how I would not go against Bazhun’an on the surface.”</p><p>“Therefore, you still have to follow the orders of Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison.”</p><p>“But when Bazhun’an insists that you listen to his orders, you have to listen to them. Because Bazhun’an is the true master of the Black and White Veins. Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison is only one of his subordinates.”</p><p>“And only when I strongly stress that you must not listen to Bazhun’an’s orders, only then should you choose me… However, the possibility of this happening is almost zero, unless I have the strength to defeat Bazhun’an.”</p><p>Defeat Bazhun’an?</p><p>Elder Han was shocked. He had never had such a ridiculous thought, but he understood Chen Tan’s words. “Alright, you don’t have to teach me. I know everything!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt his teeth ache. He wondered if it was good that Elder Han regained his arrogance. Soon, he stopped and did not bother about these details.</p><p>“One last question. Do you really have 10,000 Void Crystals?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Where did you get them from?” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t believe that Elder Han could gain 10,000 Void Crystals while he was pursued by Rao Yaoyao. It was impossible.</p><p>“When I left the Inner Island, Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison… That fellow…”</p><p>“Address him in whatever way you see fit.”</p><p>“Oh, oh, that was the money that Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison collected from the people of the Inner Island for me. This almost emptied out everyone’s coffers on the Inner Island.”</p><p>“He gave it to you only?”</p><p>“Where are your companions?” Xu Xiaoshou was a little suspicious. With Elder Han’s brains, wouldn’t it be a waste to gather 10,000 Void Crystals solely for him?</p><p>“How could I have any companions?” Elder Han laughed.</p><p>“That group of people might be strong, but not many are fit to come out. ”</p><p>“Holy Emperor Fengtian was saved because the outside world needed chaos. He had the best ability to stir up trouble in the Shengshen Continent, and he paid a huge price for it.”</p><p>“The reason why Patriarch Wuji was able to come out was because his Divine Secret skill could deceive the Heavens. There’s a high chance that he’ll be able to come out. From the looks of it, he should have succeeded. ”</p><p>“For me, it’s because I know how to escape… Yes, I am extremely proficient in escape techniques. As for the others, even if they want to poop or pee, the Holy Divine Palace can see it clearly.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was enlightened.</p><p>No wonder Elder Han had the chance to come out.</p><p>Logically speaking, according to his position in the Inner Island of the Abyss Island, no matter what, he would never get the chance.</p><p>“Looks like you… Yes, in terms of escape techniques, you’re extraordinarily strong.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded thoughtfully.</p><p>An escape technique that was acknowledged by the Third Ancestor of the White Vein and the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was probably not just any ordinary escape technique.</p><p>No wonder Rao Yaoyao, who had withstood the Saint Calamity and had the Cang Godhood Sword, couldn’t kill this guy.</p><p>“Hand it over.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>As long as Elder Han made up his mind, he would not hesitate at all. He handed over the 10,000 Void Crystals to the current owner without any second thoughts. He had completely forgotten how the people on the Inner Island had gathered the money for his travel expenses.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took the spatial ring and scanned it with his spiritual senses. It was densely packed with black hexagonal crystals.</p><p>Elder Han had not lied. He really had rich assets!</p><p>“This was meant to be used in exchange for the secondary plane door. I don’t know what kind of punishment I will receive if the secondary plane door is gone. I don’t think there would be a good ending even if I brought it back…” Elder Han felt a little regretful.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at him and put away the spatial ring. He chuckled and said.</p><p>“Follow me, and you will no longer be punished by others!”</p><p>“Now, even Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison and Bazhun’an will give you face. If you meet them again in the future and talk about this matter, tell them that your Void Crystals were taken by a person called Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>“They won’t blame you, nor would they ask you for the reason. They will just let this matter go immediately.”</p><p>Elder Han was shocked.</p><p>Wasn’t this a scam?</p><p>And the scammer, wasn’t he already the famous successor of Bazhun’an in the Inner Island?</p><p>“This, really?”</p><p>“Just do what I tell you to do. There’s no need to think! Your thoughts have no value whatsoever. Otherwise, why would Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison refuse to disclose who you had to look for after you came out.”</p><p>When Elder Han heard this, he instantly felt more confident.</p><p>He could hear the reprimand in Lord Chen Tan’s tone, but he did not show the slightest bit of anger.</p><p>Words like ‘there’s no need to think’ were only used by the big shots on the Inner Island.</p><p>The fact that Lord Chen Tan said this when he saw him proved that he had the same mindset as those big shots.</p><p>This kind of person lacked everything except brains. As long as he obediently acted as his tool, he could taste any kind of fresh blood.</p><p>Only the Heavens knew that Elder Han had never enjoyed the opportunity to be a tool for others on the Inner Island of the Abyss Island!</p><p>Elder Han was a standard chess piece.</p><p>He had been high-spirited before. After all, he was a Demi-Saint.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
