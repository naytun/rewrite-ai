(3)</h1><p>1619 The Master of Void Island, the Door of the Secondary Plane! (3)</p><p>Gu Qinger was full of curiosity as he listened to the conversation.</p><p>His worries had been alleviated by Senior Brother’s words of enlightenment during the Arena, where he had mentioned that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man may not be weaker than the Supreme Master. Now, Gu Qinger wanted to ask about the “death countdown” that had been mentioned.</p><p>But as soon as Gu Qingyi reached out his hand to ask, he was immediately silenced.</p><p>After all, he didn’t want to pry into the private matters of his saviour, even if he was curious.</p><p>Suddenly, Xu Xiaoshou felt a spiritual shock as the Death Exemption Token transformed into a spiritual light and entered his brow, clearing the countdown from his mind.</p><p>At that moment, everything seemed brighter and clearer, and the Zhen Huang Palace even seemed to glow a little more.Xu Xiaoshou felt like even the air around him had become fresher – even though nothing had changed.</p><p>Finally, as the burden was lifted .and Xu Xiaoshou was overjoyed.</p><p>This meant that his past misdeeds in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer were now in the past and he would no longer face any divine punishment.</p><p>But after some time had passed, Xu Xiaoshou started to have doubts.</p><p>The death countdown had only been a countdown, and nothing had actually happened during that time.</p><p>The Death Exemption Token had been a single-use item, and it had disappeared as soon as it had been used.</p><p>Could it be that all of these things were just a ploy by Abyss Island to collect Void Crystals?</p><p>Despite his suspicions, Xu Xiaoshou was too afraid to risk his own life to find out.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou still had 55 Void Crystals in his hands, and he had no intention of returning them to Gu Qinger.</p><p>He couldn’t figure out the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, and giving the crystals to Gu Qinger would only cause more harm than good, maybe even bring bad luck.</p><p>It would be best to use them if he could.</p><p>I wonder if Master Siren and Xiao Kongtong got their hands on Death Exemption Tokens,” Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself.</p><p>Even if he bought another token now, he might not be able to find those two and give them away.</p><p>Maybe they were already so powerful that they had already solved their death countdowns, and buying another token would just be a waste.</p><p>“What else can be exchanged here?” Xu Xiaoshou asked, looking towards the giant statue.</p><p>It took a while for the statue to respond. “Zhen Huang Ranking…”</p><p>Just as the words were spoken.</p><p>A golden light list descended in front of the statue with a hundred or so things that could be exchanged with Void Crystals in the Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>Some were shining, while others had lost their lustre and turned grey.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately noticed the “Death Exemption Token” listed in the middle of the list, which was the same height as him. “Death Exemption Token, Void Crystal: 50.”</p><p>Above it was something similar. “Exemption Order, Void Crystal: 50.”</p><p>Both were worth 50 Void Crystals.</p><p>He scanned down the list. At the bottom, there were many small items starting at one Void Crystal and mostly two or three.</p><p>“Remove ankle shackles, Void Crystal: 1.”</p><p>“Remove handcuffs, Void Crystal: 1.”</p><p>“Remove all body restraints, Void Crystal: 10.”</p><p>…</p><p>These were all clearly designed for Abyss Island sinners.</p><p>From this, it could be seen that the sinners who used to live on Abyss Island were really like prisoners in jail, with ankle and handcuffs and other restraints.</p><p>Suddenly, Xu Xiaoshou remembered the wretched saint he had seen in the White Cave, who also had handcuffs and ankle shackles…</p><p>Shaking his head, he didn’t pay much attention to it. He looked up at the top of the Zhen Huang Ranking and directly at the first item.</p><p>“The second surface gate, Void Crystal: 10,000.”</p><p>10,000?!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes bulged out. How was it possible to get that many Void Crystals?</p><p>Find 10,000 invaders on Abyss Island, all of them at the Higher Void level, and kill them one by one for a mission. Or just kill Void Attendants directly and steal them?</p><p>“Void attendants have killed so many people. They must have violated the rules and caught the attention of the spirit of Abyss Island, right? When the time comes, they won’t even know how they died, let alone exchange the stolen money for a Death Exemption Token – it’s impossible!”</p><p>“What is the Second-Faced Gate?” Gu Qinger obviously noticed this and swallowed his saliva before asking.</p><p>The giant statue was really slow. After hesitating for a while, it said emotionlessly, “The Second-Faced Gate can connect the Inner and Outer Islands of the Abyss Island.</p><p>It can manipulate the descent of the Abyss Island and return it to the Time-Space Fracture in the other world.”</p><p>In an instant, Xu Xiaoshou felt his body covered in goosebumps from his calves to the top of his head. It was the Second-Faced Gate!</p><p>The Eight Immortals must want this thing!</p><p>No matter what he wants to do, he can only fully implement his plan if he obtains the Dimensional Gate</p><p>“Connecting the Inner and Outer Islands of the Abyss Island, manipulating the descent of the Abyss Island, or making its return to the Time-Space Fracture… isn’t this equivalent to being the master of the Abyss Island?” Gu Qingyi was also shocked like Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He seemed to know something and stared at the “Second-Faced Gate” that was ranked first on the list for a long time, unable to move his gaze away.</p><p>“Senior Brother, what are the Inner and Outer Islands of the Abyss Island? Does the Abyss Island’s Sky City also have this?” Gu Qinger scratched his head.</p><p>“You don’t need to know.” Gu Qingyi stared coldly at him and his Second Junior Brother shrank his neck, not daring to ask any more.</p><p>At this moment, a head popped up from Xu Xiaoshou’s side.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
