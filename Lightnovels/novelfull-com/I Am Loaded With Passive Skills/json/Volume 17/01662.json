(5)</p><p>This scene was too shocking!</p><p>She could understand why Xu Xiaoshou had saved her.</p><p>This was what Mu Zixi had expected. When she encountered danger, a giant would descend from the sky in the form of her Senior Brother and save her.</p><p>However, this Five Decays of Heaven and Man…</p><p>What was his rationale?</p><p>No matter what, he also extended a leg to help… Wait, he also sent the Void Attendant flying with a kick?</p><p>Did he also have a body like Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had turned into a giant so he could break the Void Attendant’s head…</p><p>“Gulp!”</p><p>The little girl gulped and was a little afraid of the orange masked man in front of her.</p><p>She had a natural fear of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. No matter what the other party’s condition was, even Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi was afraid of him.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>A golden light swept past the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and Xu Xiaoshou directly grabbed little junior sister.</p><p>His reddened Berserk Giant’s eyes widened and he stared at the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. He did not say anything and just stared silently.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man raised his head, and he smiled under his half-mask. He didn’t give any explanation and gave a slight smile. “Let’s work together!”</p><p>Work together… Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t fathom this pervert’s thoughts at all. He didn’t want to cooperate at all, but if he rejected him directly, it might cause a counterattack.</p><p>“Why?” he asked.</p><p>“You want to kill Ye Xiao, Demi-Saint Jiang and Yu Lingdi. You want to kill your way up to the Holy Divine Palace. I can help you. They are all my… Yama’s ultimate goals!”</p><p>As the Five Decays of Heaven and Man spoke, the dead Void Attendant turned into a grayish-black fog and disappeared into his robe.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally understood why he was able to sever the head of the Void Attendant with a single kick.</p><p>“What’s the condition?” Xu Xiaoshou could only watch helplessly as the Void Attendant was being devoured!</p><p>As for the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, his recovery was visible.</p><p>What kind of ability was this?</p><p>The Body of Decay had such a method that it could swallow energy from other places to enrich itself?</p><p>Or could it be that this was the power of his Ghost Beast?</p><p>“There’s no need for any conditions. If we’re working together, you don’t have to be so hostile toward me. I don’t have any ill intentions towards you, and I can help you accomplish what you want. You just have to help me a few times when necessary.” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man said.</p><p>“How many times?”</p><p>“It’s up to you the number of times you want to do it. I trust you, and my biggest hope is that you won’t interfere with my actions. Of course, if you wish, you Saint Servants can also ignore me, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou keenly caught the main point of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>“Only with you?”</p><p>“Only with me.”</p><p>“What about Yama?”</p><p>“What does his life and death have to do with me?”</p><p>What a cold-blooded pervert… Xu Xiaoshou understood the true intention of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>“I can cooperate, but I will never do it…”</p><p>“Don’t worry, I won’t get you to do anything that would go against your principles. You have absolute freedom, just like your position among the Saint Servants. You can even go against our partnership and use the Black Hand against me if you want.” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man interrupted.</p><p>“Are you crazy?” This time, even Mu Zixi couldn’t hold it in any longer. She was curled up in the palm of the Berserk Giant and spoke weakly.</p><p>“How about it?” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was unmoved.</p><p>“I agree!” Xu Xiaoshou nodded. “I won’t interfere with your actions on the Abyss Island. I can even help you when necessary, but you can’t attack me and my junior sister. You and Yama.”</p><p>The corners of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s mouth curled up as he stretched out his hand.</p><p>“Happy cooperation.”</p><p>He was only as tall as the Golden Giant’s toes, but he still stretched out his hand and quietly waited for the giant to bend down and shake his hand.</p><p>The scene was extremely comical!</p><p>“Happy cooperation.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said simply. He had no intention of shaking his hand.</p><p>Who knew what kind of bad luck he would encounter if he touched this Body of Decay?</p><p>After he put Mu Zixi down and shrank, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man ignored Xu Xiaoshou, who was still tidying up his clothes. He turned to stare at the girl with the two ponytails.</p><p>“Little lass, do you want to stay in your Senior Brother’s arms for the rest of your life. While you enjoy the peace, you’ll let him face the storm?”</p><p>Mu Zixi was stunned.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glared at him. “What are you trying to do?”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man did not move as he looked at Mu Zixi. “Little girl, come with me. I won’t do anything to you. However, only when you join Yama and work with me can you keep your God Devil Eyes. This would be good for you and Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>Mu Zixi subconsciously wanted to lean toward her Senior Brother, but when she tried to move, she suddenly stopped.</p><p>“Are you sick?” Xu Xiaoshou stood in front of his junior sister and glared at him coldly. “Is Yama out to poach anyone he sees? I’ve said it before, I won’t join Yama and neither will my junior sister!”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man stared at the angry young man in front of him quietly. There was still traces of blood in his right eye.</p><p>“This is her life. You can’t make a decision for her… Just like you, no one can make decisions for you or influence your will, right?”</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pulled his junior sister and turned to leave. He wanted to dissolve the cooperation agreement they just made, but he didn’t dare.</p><p>He couldn’t afford to offend him.</p><p>I’ll just go into hiding?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>“Don’t tell me you’re tempted? He’s a lunatic!” Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. No way, was little junior sister that stupid?</p><p>“No, that secondary plane door…”</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly realized what was going on and turned to look in the direction of the secondary plane door.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
