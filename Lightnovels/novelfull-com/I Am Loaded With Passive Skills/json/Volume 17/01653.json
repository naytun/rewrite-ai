The following thoughts about Ye Xiao’s physique were derived from his thoughts.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man had hidden some stuff!</p><p>“He didn’t say exactly that Ye Xiao’s Body of Death had failed to advance and that she didn’t have the qualifications to advance to the Immortal Body.”</p><p>“He misled me and kept his true purpose hidden. ”</p><p>“So, what’s his reason to ask Ye Xiao now?”</p><p>“He wants to… abandon the Body of Decay and take possession of the incomplete Immortal Body?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waited quietly.</p><p>Ye Xiao, who was controlled by the Three Loathsome Eyes, answered the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s question after a short period of time.</p><p>“I’ve already… Death… Eight times, still short of… one… opportunity…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou trembled when he heard that.</p><p>So the Immortal Body needed to die nine times?</p><p>Ye Xiao, only need just one last step?</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man spoke very quickly and continued to ask, “Do you think this is your chance now?”</p><p>“Then when will it be?”</p><p>“Arrival… Ghost City of the Netherworld… The soul melted… At that time…”</p><p>Ghost City of the Netherworld?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou heard a familiar term.</p><p>He had already learned about the names of the nine extreme grounds in Abyss Island from Master Siren.</p><p>This Ghost City of the Netherworld was one of them.</p><p>“Do you have the confidence that you would survive this calamity and cultivate the Immortal Body?” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man asked again.</p><p>“No, I’m not sure…”</p><p>“Trash!”</p><p>“D*mn it!” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man suddenly cursed and gave Xu Xiaoshou a fright.</p><p>Soon, his tone calmed down and he spoke again.</p><p>“I don’t have time to let you go to the Ghost City of the Netherworld. Other than this condition, what other preparations do you think you need to make to help you survive this last calamity?”</p><p>“There’s no other… way…”</p><p>“What about this?”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man did not believe that there was only one way for Ye Xiao to cultivate the Immortal Body.</p><p>As he spoke, he took out a blood-red pearl from his sleeve.</p><p>This Blood Pearl looked extremely strange. Even the Five Decays of Heaven and Man did not dare to take it lightly. Even though it was a support, it was isolated by an extremely dense Decay Qi.</p><p>He handed the Blood Pearl over and Ye Xiao took it.</p><p>Ye Xiao was defenseless and did not even have an insulation layer of spiritual source.</p><p>At that moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes widened. He could clearly see the faint red light on the Blood Pearl, that covered Ye Xiao’s entire body in a flash.</p><p>The three gray flowers in Ye Xiao’s eyes glowed with a faint red color.</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>There was a muffled groan.</p><p>The Life force in Ye Xiao’s body began to drain away. It was as if Mu Zixi had stabbed her. The vitality breath was swallowed by the Blood Pearl in large mouthfuls.</p><p>“What sort of sorcery is this?” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were solemn.</p><p>A treasure that had the same attribute as little junior sister’s. If this thing was brought over, wouldn’t little junior sister be like a tiger with wings?</p><p>However…</p><p>When he saw this strange ability, it even absorbed one’s Life force…</p><p>It was too evil for little junior sister and not suitable at all. He should not let his imagination run wild and mess about with it -she was already a little too evil to begin with!</p><p>“What did you see?” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man asked.</p><p>Ye Xiao, a higher void, was obviously too weak. Not only was her voice intermittent, but even her breathing was very shallow.</p><p>“Nether… Ghost Capital…”</p><p>Ghost City of the Netherworld again?</p><p>Not only Xu Xiaoshou, but the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was also surprised.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>“The source of the calamity, the Guidance of death…The Blood World Pearl is a Great Psionic Weapon that can let you see your place of death.”</p><p>“This old man is right in front of you! One slap and you’ll die here. How can you only see… the Ghost City of the Netherworld?”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man muttered to himself and shook his head in confusion.</p><p>Great Psionic Weapons?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>If he understood correctly…</p><p>This Blood World Pearl, one of the Great Psionic Weapons, was on the same level as the Imitator?</p><p>Something was wrong!</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man, something was very wrong!</p><p>What was he trying to do!</p><p>While Xu Xiaoshou mulled over this, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man seemed to have thought of another possibility.</p><p>He dissipated the strong aura of decay in his hands and used his fingertip to touch the Blood World Pearl.</p><p>Weng!</p><p>A bright red light flashed, and a red glow appeared in the eyes of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>His entire body tensed up. After he touched the Blood World Pearl, he quickly removed his finger. The power of the black Ghost Beast erupted from his body, as if he was eliminating some threat.</p><p>After the dense Ghost Beast power completely devoured it and returned to his body, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man finally spoke,</p><p>“What do you see now? The scene of your death!”</p><p>Pain appeared in Ye Xiao’s eyes as if she was struggling, but she quickly lost her resistance. As an outsider, she could only state dejectedly.</p><p>“I saw…”</p><p>“Three-legged black owl, swallow the Blood World Pearl…”</p><p>“Doomsday, lightning, calamity…This was the scene of the Saint Calamity…Three-legged black owl, forcefully transcending the Saint Calamity…”</p><p>“Death, sinking, eternal sleep…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
