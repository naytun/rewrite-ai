(5)</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s hand trembled.</p><p>He only had three days left.</p><p>If he launched another attack, he would probably only have one or two days left.</p><p>He decided to attack…</p><p>“Wait until the space rift splits and you are about to be banished to the Inner Island of the Abyss Island.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, I will be aware of the Transformation in the space before you and I will take action.”</p><p>“At that time, you will no longer have to endure the pain on the Inner Island. I will guide the spatial power. At that moment…”</p><p>“Even if you had regained your Demi-Saint strength! What other trump card did he have hidden up his sleeves? With the help of the spatial exile power of the Outer Island of Abyss Island, he can kill you.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s heart sank as he withdrew all his power.</p><p>What a perfect plan!</p><p>He couldn’t help but applaud Huang Quan!</p><p>He didn’t even need to spend much effort to kill a Demi-Saint in the crack of the Outer Island with just a distortion of the power of Abyss Island. How easy was that?</p><p>“We don’t seem to have a life and death feud,” Jiang Buyi looked at the two of them and said seriously.</p><p>“There is.” Huang Quan was still as calm as ever, as if he was counting his family’s treasures.</p><p>“Heaven Prayer Forest, I don’t know how I managed to get the Three Loathsome Eyes so easily.”</p><p>“Now that you’ve appeared in the Yunlun Mountain Range, everything can be explained.”</p><p>“Since this is just a bait, you have my Yama’s Lei Family’s Eyes on your mind. Why do you have to keep it a secret?”</p><p>“You want to take away people’s lives and proclaim your innocence. Why would a Demi-Saint do this?”</p><p>“Let’s get everything straight. You want to kill me, and I want to kill you. Can’t you just say it directly?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi shook his head slowly when he heard that. “That’s not the case. The Three Loathsome Eyes, I just didn’t want to…”</p><p>“I’m curious!”</p><p>Huang Quan interrupted him and said.</p><p>“You even used the Three Loathsome Eyes as bait, and you’re not afraid that I, Yama, will turn against you after I obtain them.”</p><p>“You don’t have the God Devil Eyes. There is only one pair in the world.”</p><p>“What did you leave for yourself?”</p><p>Huang Quan suddenly became curious.</p><p>He was truly curious as he stared into Jiang Buyi’s eyes and said fervently.</p><p>“Let’s see it, Jiang Buyi!”</p><p>“As a direct participant in the Lei family’s matter, at this time, it should be the end of the road for you, right?”</p><p>“Show me your trump card and whatever last resort you’ve hidden. Bring it all out!”</p><p>“I’m really too curious… What did the Lei Family’s Eyes you kept for yourself look like?”</p><p>When he said this, Ye Xiao, Yu Lingdi, and Mei Siren couldn’t help but stare at Jiang Buyi’s eyes.</p><p>That was right!</p><p>If he could even offer the Three Loathsome Eyes, what did Jiang Buyi have left for himself?</p><p>Nothing?</p><p>Impossible!</p><p>To be able to live as a Demi-Saint in the Shengshen Continent, which one of them was not crafty and a schemer? How could they cut off their own path of retreat?</p><p>“I really don’t…”</p><p>“I really don’t want to…”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s face was bleak as he muttered sadly, “Why do you always have to force me? This is something that can be resolved amicably.”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>In the labyrinth at the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>The black cloud broke through the wall and pierced through the Void Attendant’s chest. It then headed straight for Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>The moment it tore through the air, three strange eyeballs that were not that visible in the darkness could be seen at the front of the flowing cloud.</p><p>“Save…” Ye Xiao suddenly stared at Yu Lingdi and whispered their telepathic communication, “He can’t die… here!”</p><p>“Don’t worry, I know.” Yu Lingdi waved his hand lightly and indicated that Ye Xiao didn’t need to say anything else. If she continued, she would be dead.</p><p>Jiang Buyi could not die!</p><p>Especially after he signed a contract with him, Yu Lingdi.</p><p>They were already in the same boat. Even if they were to die, they would die for the Holy Divine Palace and not due to their personal grudges.</p><p>However…</p><p>For Huang Quan and Mei Siren, how would he handle them?</p><p>Not to mention how much it would cost to activate the secondary plane door.</p><p>Once this thing was revealed, perhaps Huang Quan would directly turn around and target him.</p><p>How should he break this game?</p><p>Yu Lingdi began to plan.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>Ye Xiao spoke again.</p><p>She could no longer maintain her human form and had transformed into a three-legged black owl. Her eyes were filled with determination.</p><p>“You?” Yu Lingdi was stunned. “What do you want to do?”</p><p>“I don’t have much time left. Although I don’t know what happened earlier, I…” Ye Xiao lowered her head and looked at her abdomen. “I have an additional Blood World Pearl in my body.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi was silent.</p><p>After Ye Xiao was controlled by the Three Loathsome Eyes, he could not remember what had happened before, but now he did.</p><p>The Blood World Pearl had been forcibly stuffed into her mouth by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man!</p><p>“I will break through and become a Demi-Saint. They will have to run away due to the Saint Calamity. This is the chance to save Demi-Saint Jiang,” Ye Xiao said through their telepathic communication.</p><p>“This…” Yu Lingdi’s pupils constricted. Wasn’t this what the Five Decays Of Heaven and Man wanted? Had Ye Xiao forgotten all about it?</p><p>“When I use the Blood World Pearl as a semi-saint person, I might not die. I might even be able to cultivate an Immortal Body. This time, I have to take a gamble!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s mouth was agape and he seemed to be in a daze, as if he wanted to stop her.</p><p>However, when he raised his eyes and glanced at Jiang Buyi, he realized that he could not say anything to stop her. This was the only solution.</p><p>However, he had just stopped Ye Xiao’s Saint Calamity!</p><p>Was this fate?</p><p>When the Five Decays of Heaven and Man came into contact with the Blood World Pearl at that time, what did he see?</p><p>“Stop them and wait for reinforcements.”</p><p>“Our Demi-Saint will be here soon!”</p><p>Ye Xiao knew that Rao Yaoyao wouldn’t be able to accomplish anything big, but Dao Qiongcang definitely had a backup plan. Perhaps he was on his way here now.</p><p>She suddenly turned and stared straight at Yu Lingdi. Her eyes seemed to pierce through his soul.</p><p>“Can I trust you?”</p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao wished that Yu Lingdi was actually Dao Qiongcang or Yu Mo!</p><p>She had not worked with Yu Lingdi much and rarely interacted with him. She did not know much of this young man’s strategy and if it was as good as his father’s.</p><p>If she were to bet all her chips on this young man who was a full generation younger than herself… what if she eventually discovered that he was even worse than Rao Yaoyao…</p><p>“You can always trust me!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi suddenly said as his eyes blazed with a fervent light.</p><p>How could he not know what Ye Xiao meant? How could he not hear Ye Xiao’s underestimation?</p><p>“I’m stronger than him!”</p><p>Ye Xiao stared at Yu Lingdi silently and finally closed her eyes.</p><p>“Aww!”</p><p>An owl’s cry startled the three people who were still in a confrontation in Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>Jiang Buyi, Huang Quan, and Mei Siren all turned. They were shocked to see that above the head of the three-legged black owl that looked like a semi-saint person, a blood-red bead floated.</p><p>One of the top ten Great Psionic Weapons, the Blood World Pearl!</p><p>“She dared to use this thing to become a Saint?”</p><p>No one responded.</p><p>However, the first peal of thunder in the Nine Heavens was the response!</p><p>At this moment…</p><p>In the First Hall of Sins at Zhen Huang Palace, Abyss Island, the Saint Calamity was about to take place again!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
