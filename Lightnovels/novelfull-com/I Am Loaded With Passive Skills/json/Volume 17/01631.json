(3)</p><p>“Therefore, among the four leaders of the Inner Island, Lord Qingshi has nothing to do with me…”</p><p>“Could it be that the treasure he wants to bet on… Uh, the one he wants to give me, is the stone in Elder Han’s hand?”</p><p>“Well, it doesn’t seem like it. He said that he was only lending it to Elder Han…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered, sizing up the adorable but brainless Elder Han, who seemed a bit intimidated. Xu Xiaoshou had never seen a demi-saint so timorous and meek.</p><p>There was no way this guy could be referred to as an “Elder”. He was too cute and dorky.</p><p>Adding an “Elder” to his title was probably to cast an imposing presence upon his beholders at the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes.</p><p>“Elder Han can’t possibly know who I am, but judging from the rumors on the Inner Island, I’m afraid that the name ‘Xu Xiaoshou’ has gained notoriety.”</p><p>“The person that Lord Qingshi wants Elder Han to wait for is most likely me.”</p><p>“Elder Han may not recognize me, but that doesn’t mean Lord Qingshi doesn’t know me… Perhaps, this meeting is the best scenario he has imagined?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had caught a blind spot.</p><p>“Lord Qingshi is giving a demi-saint to me?”</p><p>“This foolish saint doesn’t even know who used him… However, the person who used him must have understood the intention of Lord Qingshi and found Elder Han’s weakness to manipulate him.”</p><p>“Phew, this feeling…”</p><p>At a certain moment, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had drifted out of the game and was gradually dealing with the players behind the scenes who influenced the development of the world.</p><p>This was something he would never have felt before he went to the Abyss Island!</p><p>However, at this moment, everything seemed to be within reach.</p><p>Except for the layer of veil that had not been completely pierced, their intentions were transparent to one another.</p><p>It was very mystical!</p><p>This feeling was all too mystical!</p><p>They had never met before, but this tacit understanding, this rapport… In other words, under the other party’s arrangements, he could immediately take charge as soon as he took over. It was a satisfying and exhilarating feeling as if one had just experienced a drunken revelry.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou was afraid that he was deceiving himself.</p><p>Had he deified Lord Qingshi? Perhaps Lord Qingshi had not thought this far ahead.</p><p>“Lord Qingshi is the most mysterious person,” Elder Han replied without hesitation. “Even the other two ancestors of the White Vein and the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon hold him in awe. He was the oldest leader. No one knew his true form, his abilities, or anything else about him… Only rumors that he is unparalleled in wisdom and bravery, and he was the only person who didn’t want to leave the Inner Island. Of course, that’s all hearsay.”</p><p>This was a dangerous individual!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but sigh.</p><p>He hated this kind of character the most. Elusive and hard to read, always lurking in the shadows and delivering a fatal blow out of nowhere.</p><p>At this moment, he no longer doubted his thoughts.</p><p>This was because Dao Qiongcang and Bazhun’an all had the same aura as Lord Qingshi.</p><p>Even if Xu Xiaoshou was stupid enough to question his intelligence, he would never think that a person with the stealth of Lord Qingshi would be like Elder Han, valiant but unwise.</p><p>“You’ve given me a tough one…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his temples as he felt a headache coming on.</p><p>He was eager to have Elder Han on his side!</p><p>No matter what, this was a demi-saint. From his display of the “Ganges River” style, it was evident that this guy had the strength to fight. Moreover, this was still his weak period!</p><p>All Elder Han needed was to be given the “Holy Medicine” to heal, find a higher void ice-type host body for him to possess, and he would be unfettered like a sword of out its sheath. He would kill anyone who stood in his way!</p><p>He was weak and of lower rank on Abyss Island, but this was no longer the case.</p><p>Once outside of Abyss Island, in the five domains of the continent, having Elder Han was like having a secret weapon. If used well, even Jiang Buyi could be taken down!</p><p>But…</p><p>“This is too troublesome!”</p><p>Elder Han’s lack of shrewdness did not worry Xu Xiaoshou at all.</p><p>As long as he had capable people at his disposal, they could point and strike with accuracy.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not afraid of the scheming Rao Yaoyao. However, he was unsettled when Rao Yaoyao fearlessly broke the seal with her sword and released Elder Han.</p><p>He knew that once Rao Yaoyao became a saint, she would have to deal with the demi-saint ghost beast that she had released herself.</p><p>It would be a fight to the bitter end when the time comes.</p><p>This was the only concern for Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>If he took in Elder Han, he would no longer be able to operate in the dark. Rao Yaoyao only needed to track down Elder Han and trace back to the person behind the scenes.</p><p>His true identity would be revealed, and he would be fully exposed to the big shots at the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>The person using Rao Yaoyao was definitely much stronger than the person using Elder Han. Xu Xiaoshou was not one to belittle himself, but he also could not compare himself to the likes of Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>“What are you thinking about?” Elder Han looked at the silly boy in front of him who was frowning and thinking hard. His small hands were stretched out straight, pointing downwards in front of his chest, looking humble and subservient.</p><p>“Too dumb.” The more Xu Xiaoshou looked at him, the more absurd Elder Han seemed. His face grew somewhat dark and sullen.</p><p>“What did you say?” Elder Han scratched his head with his broken hand but could not reach it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was rendered speechless.</p><p>He lowered his head and deliberated for a long time. Finally, he took out the Holy Medicine from the Yuan Mansion and tossed it over.</p><p>“Eat it.”</p><p>“What is this?” Elder Han held the Holy Medicine and hesitated. “It won’t be poisonous, right?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
