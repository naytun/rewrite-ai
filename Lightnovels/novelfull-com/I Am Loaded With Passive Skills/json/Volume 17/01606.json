(1)</p><p>Although Xu Xiaoshou covered Gu Qinger’s mouth immediately, it was too late.</p><p>After the words ‘Jiang Buyi’ popped out, it was like water that had been spilled and could not be taken back. There was no room for redemption.</p><p>“Wham!”</p><p>The void echoed with a loud resonance. The three of them felt a huge pressure press down on their heads. It contained a Demi-Saint’s will.</p><p>The dome seemed to turn into an invisible giant eye that glanced at them from an unknown place. It swept across the three people below, and caused their hair to stand on end and their scalps to go numb.</p><p>“This is… a Demi-Saint?” Gu Qinger was stunned.</p><p>He had never thought that when he casually recited the words, it was actually the honorific name of a Demi-Saint!</p><p>The key point was that there really was a Demi-Saint in the First Hall of Sins, and that Demi-Saint did not seem to be far away. Now, he seemed to have followed his guidance and scrutinized him from afar?</p><p>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry…”</p><p>“I really didn’t do it on purpose!”</p><p>Gu Qinger was like a cat whose fur stood on end. He jumped behind his Eldest Senior Brother and clutched the back of Gu Qingyi’s robe tightly.</p><p>The so-called Demi-Saint…</p><p>In Gu Qinger’s understanding, they were all existences equivalent to his Supreme Master. To put it bluntly in a simple sentence: He couldn’t afford to offend them, and he definitely should not have taken the initiative to provoke them!</p><p>Gu Qingyi didn’t have time to teach his junior brother a lesson.</p><p>He held the Demonic Sword Yuelian in one hand. The cold Sword Will in his body was like a sword that soared into the sky and tore apart the Demi-Saint’s pressure.</p><p>A light flashed in his eyes, and two small dark swords appeared. Then, the two small swords gathered together and turned into a red light between his eyebrows.</p><p>“A Red Ghost Inscription?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was surprised.</p><p>He was like a turtle now as he reduced his presence to the barest minimum and tried his best to make Gu Qingyi look more prominent.</p><p>Gu Qinger was the one who provoked him, so it was only right that his Senior Brother Gu Qingyi cleaned up his mess, right?</p><p>In Xu Xiaoshou’s case, his face was now one that was unfamiliar to Jiang Buyi, and his aura was completely different from Xu Xiaoshou’s.</p><p>In addition, even though the battle in the Forest of Miracles was very tragic, Jiang Buyi had never seen Xu Xiaoshou in person, so he was not afraid he would be recognized.</p><p>Gu Qingyi’s aura turned cold after his Red Ghost Inscription appeared.</p><p>A faint wisp of Holy Will drifted out from his body.</p><p>This Holy Will had obviously not been produced by him. It was completely different from the Holy Power that Xu Xiaoshou obtained after he swallowed the Holy Miracle Fruit. It was a genuine external force that belonged to the Eight Classics!</p><p>After he borrowed the Red Ghost Inscription to temporarily obtain the Saint Stage aura, Gu Qingyi was able to hold his head up high and stick his chest out when he met the gaze of the Demi-Saint. He was neither humble or overbearing.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to offend Senior. This matter was purely an accident. I apologize to Senior first.”</p><p>Gu Qingyi spoke very quickly, as if he knew that if he spoke slowly, he might never be able to speak again in his life. After he apologized, he continued.</p><p>“I am Gu Qingyi from the Burial Sword Tomb. This is my junior brother, Gu Qinger.”</p><p>“My Master, Wen Ting, had long heard of Demi-Saint Jiang’s fame. He asked me to send his regards.”</p><p>“The Puxuan Jiang Clan of the North Region and the Eastern Region’s Burial Sword Tomb did not have many exchanges before this. Today, we can use this opportunity to set up more exchanges in the future. In the future, I will prepare a generous gift and personally visit to express my apology.”</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>This Gu Qingyi’s brain certainly worked so rapidly!</p><p>First, he apologized. Second, he brought up his Master’s name. Finally, he ended it with such beautiful phrases. He turned the crisis into peace and turned this offensive action into the start of an exchange that would be beneficial to both factions.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but glance at Gu Qinger, who had grabbed the back of Gu Qingyi’s robe and had buried his head under his Senior Brother’s buttocks. He fell into deep thought.</p><p>These were disciples taught by the same Master?</p><p>The Demi-Saint’s pressure in the sky lasted for a long time. It didn’t stop until Gu Qingyi’s forehead was covered in sweat.</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>Accompanied by an ethereal sound that drifted down from all directions, Gu Qingyi managed to divert this calamity!</p><p>“Hu!”</p><p>Gu Qingyi heaved a sigh of relief and wiped away his sweat.</p><p>In the next second, his killing intent soared and he suddenly turned around.</p><p>“Senior Brother, I know… Hmm?”</p><p>Before Gu Qinger could finish his words, the furious Gu Qingyi suddenly whipped out the Demonic Sword Yuelian in his hand and swung it horizontally.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The force of this attack was so strong that the space shattered.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>“I know I was wrong!”</p><p>Gu Qinger lowered his body and narrowly avoided the attack.</p><p>Gu Qingyi’s killing intent grew even stronger after his first attack failed. He spun the famed sword in his hand and stabbed forward.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>From afar, where the tip of the sword pointed, a huge hole suddenly appeared on the wall of the labyrinth. It was a shocking sight.</p><p>“Peng… peng… peng…”</p><p>The walls of the labyrinth instantly collapsed, and Gu Qinger… He was completely unharmed!</p><p>“You bastard, you still dare to retaliate!”</p><p>Gu Qingyi’s eyes turned cold as he pulled back with a jerk of his elbow and the Yuelian dropped into his arms.</p><p>He held the scabbard with his palm and pressed his thumb against the hilt of the famed sword. He pushed it up and revealed the sword body that was two fingers wide.</p><p>“Boss, stop! This will kill you! ”</p><p>Gu Qinger turned pale with fright. He reached his hand into the sky, and the Blood Sword, the Bewitching Demon, appeared in his hand.</p><p>“Murder!”</p><p>As he shouted, he held the scabbard with one hand and the hilt with the other. He drew his sword on the spot and slashed it horizontally in front of his chest.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>As the sword cries rang out, an ancient beast seemed to appear from behind Gu Qingyi. It turned into a sky-piercing sword light and tore through the obstacles on the countless labyrinth walls and then slashed mercilessly at Gu Qinger.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
