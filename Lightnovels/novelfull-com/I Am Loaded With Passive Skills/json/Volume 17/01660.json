Even the Acalanātha’s defense could be shattered at a single glance!</p><p>Lei Xi’er suffered a backlash from this move, and her consciousness became muddled as if she had died. She turned back into Mu Zixi.</p><p>The God Devil Eyes could not protect her from her own attack. One could imagine how powerful this move was.</p><p>“Heart Tribulation…”</p><p>“At that time, I was able to withstand this move because I had just finished my cultivation of the Heart Sword Technique. Moreover, the result of my cultivation was the Demon Sword Technique…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was both angry and happy.</p><p>Mu Zixi was a variable that no one could control!</p><p>After this girl returned, she used a move and didn’t even care about her weakness. She shouted.</p><p>“Lord Huang Quan, run! Leave this to me. I’ll definitely make a contribution to Yama as a new member! ”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was stunned.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Who would believe that!</p><p>Who are you putting on this act for?</p><p>Do you really think you’re very smart?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know how to ridicule her. Everyone present knew that he was the one who pretended to be Lord Huang Quan. She was the only one who was being deceived.</p><p>However, little junior sister was too unreliable. The God Devil Eyes were too reliable!</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man couldn’t get close, and the second true body couldn’t destroy Yu Lingdi’s water-type Clone. Under this Heart Tribulation attack… He was frozen in place!</p><p>“Ugh…”</p><p>Not long after, Yu Lingdi’s wails resounded in the arena.</p><p>He clutched his head. After being caught off guard by this mental attack, his expression was completely distorted.</p><p>The God Devil Eyes’ unique divinity and devilish power that was impossible to be compatible with outsiders instantly caused Yu Lingdi to collapse.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>His water-type Clone suddenly expanded, and his body was filled with a surge of power that was out of control.</p><p>Even the Water-type Upanishad that swirled about the field of water became distorted and dimmed at this moment. There were magic patterns everywhere, and it seemed like that there would be a cultivation deviation.</p><p>“Heart Tribulation…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered these two words, and his eyes lit up.</p><p>Could little junior sister’s move have assimilated and transmitted the spiritual damage to the main body of Yu Lingdi’s water-type Clone?</p><p>That was why he had completely lost control?</p><p>It was very possible!</p><p>The connection between the main body and the Clone was not like the relationship between Xu Xiaoshou and his second true body.</p><p>In most cases, even the incarnation of a Demi-Saint was an inseparable part of the body.</p><p>Moreover, Yu Lingdi was only at the Cutting Path Stage and was not even considered as a higher void!</p><p>Mu Zixi stepped forward and saw that Xu Xiaoshou’s attack did not work. The Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s attack did not work, but her own attack worked.</p><p>She rushed along like a meteor, each step faster than the last. She felt that she had found her purpose.</p><p>“D*mn it…”</p><p>Yu Lingdi seemed to have calmed down. He simply could not believe that he had been tricked by a little girl after he took control of the entire situation.</p><p>However, before he could finish speaking, the black mist in Mu Zixi’s right eye shrank, and her body emitted a divine light.</p><p>“God’s Fall!”</p><p>With a boom, the Nine Heavens sent down its divine punishment again, and slammed heavily into Yu Lingdi’s water-type Clone.</p><p>With a bang, Yu Lingdi’s head exploded on the spot and burst into splatters of water that was difficult to heal.</p><p>The demonic power in his body was suppressed by the God’s Fall. The demonic patterns gradually disappeared, and he felt that he was now able to resist…</p><p>“Devil’s Might!”</p><p>Mu Zixi took another strong step forward, as if a demon had descended. Her canine teeth flashed, and her small face was scrunched up. Just when she looked both fierce and cute, her body exploded with a surge of devilish energy.</p><p>I think I can…</p><p>No! I really can!</p><p>Mu Zixi finally found her confidence. The light in her eyes grew brighter and brighter.</p><p>I can accomplish things that Xu Xiaoshou can’t.</p><p>I can defeat an enemy that Xu Xiaoshou can’t defeat.</p><p>Things are different now…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was threatened, so I should protect him. Xu Xiaoshou wants to run, I can cover his back. I’m not afraid of Yu Lingdi, whom even Xu Xiaoshou feared!</p><p>“So what if it’s a Water-type Upanishad?”</p><p>“God’s Fall!”</p><p>“Is the Cutting Path Stage powerful?”</p><p>“Devil’s Might!”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s footsteps accelerated. At one moment, she was as holy as a Saint who had descended to the mortal world. At the next moment, she was as evil as a witch who descended to the mortal world.</p><p>In short, she did not give Yu Lingdi a chance to resist or counterattack!</p><p>“When I was at the Innate Stage, you were already at the Sovereign Dao Realm.”</p><p>“When I was at the Sovereign Dao Realm, you were only at the Cutting Path Stage.”</p><p>“Who gave you the courage to stand up to me?”</p><p>“God’s Fall, Fall, Fall!”</p><p>Mu Zixi didn’t know the other moves of the God Devil Eyes. Lei Xi’er had used these moves before, and she had barely learned them after she saw them.</p><p>But it seemed like…</p><p>The most important thing was not the number of strokes, but the essence.</p><p>As long as it was useful!</p><p>Everyone was stunned by this demoness’ powerful attacks.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man had already escaped from the crumbling golden soup castle when Yu Lingdi was struck by the first attack, Divine Retribution, Heart Shattering Dao</p><p>He was extremely weak, and his breathing was faint. However, he stared in shock at Mu Zixi who had returned.</p><p>The control points of the Three Loathsome Eyes Pupils were full, but the damage output was almost zero.</p><p>As the number one eye of the Lei family, the God Devil Eyes could not only override the control of the Three Loathsome Eyes, but it was overall the master of control.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
