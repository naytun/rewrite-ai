(2)</p><p>“Sovereign Stage!”</p><p>“This is the Sovereign Stage!”</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou saw that the Passive System had leveled up again after a long time, he knew that there was no big accident in his breakthrough.</p><p>In terms of pure Spiritual Cultivation, he was now in the Sovereign Dao Realm.</p><p>In the past, the words ‘mere Master Stage’ and ‘having the combat strength of a Sovereign Stage’ and so on had all become a thing of the past.</p><p>Now, just by revealing his cultivation level, it represented the combat strength of a Sovereign Stage.</p><p>Of course, when it came to judging combat strength, those who used to use a different set of standards to measure him should now develop another set of standards.</p><p>“What’s his combat strength in Sovereign level?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not know either.</p><p>But he knew that this was only the beginning.</p><p>Following that, he would rush to level up his passive skills and check the results of the system upgrade. Only then would combat strength soar.</p><p>After a moment of joy, it cooled down again.</p><p>He ignored the two curious faces in front of him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou first looked at his own energy reserve.</p><p>After breaking through to a higher realm, the most significant change for a Spiritual Cultivator was usually their energy reserve.</p><p>Energy reserve rise…</p><p>It used to be just an adjective.</p><p>Now, it was no longer an adjective, but an objective description.</p><p>The energy reserve of a Sovereign Dao Realm was hundreds of times larger than that in the Star Worship State of the Master Stage!</p><p>The spiritual source was like the sea, inexhaustible.</p><p>Originally, a small container like the energy reserve could only hold a limited amount of spiritual sources.</p><p>Now that the breakthrough has created a prototype of a small world, not only did it have a hundred times the capacity of a Master Stage’s spiritual source, but even the Great Path had become a supply station for spiritual sources.</p><p>As for why there was such a huge change, it was naturally because of the ‘bounded domain’!</p><p>The energy reserve was boundless.</p><p>Now Xu Xiaoshou could see the illusory barrier rising around his energy reserve.</p><p>The space inside was like a mustard seed that contained a universe, forming the embryonic form of a small world on its own. It evolved into its own Path Principles, so its capacity was even larger.</p><p>However…</p><p>“Why hasn’t the explosion in this bounded domain stopped after I broke through?” Xu Xiaoshou was a little confused.</p><p>The bounded domain he saw around his energy reserve was not only with more spiritual sources.</p><p>What was even more valuable was that these spiritual sources were constantly boiling, touching, and exploding.</p><p>The little things that were usually subdued by him were also alive. They were as happy as if they had moved to a new home and no longer suppressed their nature.</p><p>The Holy Power of the Holy Miracle Fruit released the active ‘Penetrating Divine Senses’ of the sword cognition. It released the aura of the Saint Stage from the Infernal Original Seed, the Three Days Frozen Calamity, and the trembling Little Blue Flower of the Tranquil Lake…</p><p>Everyone played around, and every touch resulted in a big explosion.</p><p>The energy reserve of the Master Stage was obviously unable to withstand such destruction. It was reckoned that Xu Xiaoshou would feel uncomfortable after one explosion.</p><p>However, with the Sovereign Stage, a bounded domain enveloped them.</p><p>No matter how much they exploded, Xu Xiaoshou could only feel that they were being “naughty” and not excessively “presumptuous”. There was no harm at all!</p><p>“You guys are going too far…”</p><p>He subconsciously wanted to suppress these little things again.</p><p>However, on second thought, although the little ones were active now, it was not a problem.</p><p>Then he would not have to waste his energy taming them.</p><p>Being mischievous was also good. If they have fun, when he uses them, they will explode faster, right?</p><p>After all, the way they played was in the form of various explosions.</p><p>Infernal Original Seed and Three Day Frozen Calamity exploded, Sword Cognition and Holy Power exploded, Three Day Frozen Calamity and Sword Cognition exploded…</p><p>The two of them stuck to each other and exploded.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>“If they stick together in groups of three or five…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face twitched suddenly.</p><p>He thought of the “Saint·Seeds on All Five Fingers”. Wasn’t this equivalent to exploding this thing in his own energy reserve?</p><p>“But maybe it doesn’t matter?”</p><p>When he thought of the collision between two Saint Stage powers and the explosion in his energy reserve, he did not feel anything unusual…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had an epiphany!</p><p>When he broke through to the Sovereign Dao Realm, Xu Xiaoshou had the thought of “greediness leads to indigestion”.</p><p>Later on, he remembered the warning from Bazhun’an and simply let go, comprehending whatever he thought of, not rejecting any of it.</p><p>This was…</p><p>He found that he had comprehended all the Daos that he had previously encountered during the process of breaking through, and there was nothing wrong with them.</p><p>In any case, if they could not be compatible, then forcibly fused together. At worst, they would just explode!</p><p>It was the same principle as conducting alchemy.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not aiming to create Elixirs, but rather to ensure that the medicinal properties of the elixirs did not cause a massive explosion that could harm his enemies.</p><p>The sudden appearance of the Sovereign Dao Realm didn’t kill Xu Xiaoshou, who had turned into a container of berserk giants.</p><p>Everything just coincidentally fit into his lifestyle, “harmoniously good”.</p><p>After all, life was usually filled with fights. Occasionally, there would be a little joy. Wasn’t that normal?</p><p>This was the current manifestation of Xu Xiaoshou’s Dao, and also the lifestyle of the various treasures in his energy reserve.</p><p>Even the bounded domain…</p><p>“My bounded domain!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of his bounded domain and subconsciously opened his hand to summon it.</p><p>At this moment, all the treasures in his energy reserve stopped moving and became silent.</p><p>At the same time, various calamitous auras spread out from Xu Xiaoshou’s body.</p><p>Holy Power, Infernal Original Seek, Three Day Frozen Calamity, Sword Cognition… All sorts of scents intertwined and formed a destructive fluctuation.</p><p>“What do you want to do?”</p><p>Kong Yuhen keenly sensed that something was wrong and asked.</p><p>“It’s nothing.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his hand halfway and realized that something was wrong. He retracted his strength.</p><p>There was a high chance that his bounded domain was also an explosive type of bounded domain.</p><p>It was unrealistic to expect a special and beautiful world to be formed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
