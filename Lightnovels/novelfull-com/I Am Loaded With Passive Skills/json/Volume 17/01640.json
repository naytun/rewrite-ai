(2)</p><p>“Congratulations on becoming a Saint, Fairy Rao.”</p><p>“But at this moment, it might not be the time for you Ancient Swordsman to challenge each other. You have other important matters to attend to.”</p><p>Suddenly, a gust of wind blew across, and a shadow descended. The voice was so calm that it did not seem human. There was no hint of any congratulatory tone in it, not even a speck of emotion.</p><p>“Number Two?” Rao Yaoyao looked up. In front of her was a 30-foot-tall giant dressed in sackcloth. He was incredibly burly.</p><p>“Why are you here?”</p><p>“Elder Yan and I are here on the orders of the Hallmaster to assist Fairy Rao to shut down the Abyss Island.”</p><p>“I’m already a Demi-Saint!” Rao Yaoyao lifted her chin, and a look of pride appeared in her eyes. An Ancient Swordsman Demi-Saint differed totally from a Spiritual Cultivator Demi-Saint.</p><p>Number Two nodded. “I think I understand why Elder Yan and I needed to come here.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s gaze turned cold.</p><p>When she was still a Sword Deity, she was second to last in the ten-member council, and her voice was almost zero.</p><p>But when she became a Demi-Saint, everything was different.</p><p>In terms of background, power, and strength, she was no less than anyone else.</p><p>Right now, only Dao Qiongcang could order her around.</p><p>However, Rao Yaoyao would never refuse any help offered.</p><p>She understood that she lacked the manpower. Teng Shanhai was dead, and the Abyss Island was in chaos.</p><p>It would be best if she had someone on hand to help out.</p><p>“Speak, what is it?” Rao Yaoyao had already tried her best to suppress the sharpness she had when she had just entered the Demi-Saint realm. However, she was like an unsheathed sharp blade at this moment, and it was very difficult to restrain herself.</p><p>Number Two didn’t care about this. He said calmly,</p><p>“Three things.”</p><p>“First, the Forest of Miracles, the Sleeping Valley, Blood World, and all the other places have disappeared.”</p><p>“Secondly, the formation of the Void Suppression Stele had been destroyed and the Array Eye is in a mess. Although we found the Void Suppression Stele and moved it back to its original position, the restrictions on the Inner Island have loosened considerably. ”</p><p>“Third, the passageway from Fallen Abyss to the Inner Island had been messed up and cannot be restored. The only way to regain control of the Abyss Island now is through the secondary plane door.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao listened silently and her face turned pale gradually.</p><p>Number Two glanced at her and said calmly, “You’ve been on the Abyss Island longer than us, so I’m sure you already know all of this. Tell us what your solution is.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s eyelids twitched. She looked up and glanced at Number Two before she looked away.</p><p>“Oh, you were not aware? Sorry, I thought you knew.” Number Two’s demeanor was exceptionally calm. He asked again, “Then, what have you been doing during this period of time?”</p><p>“I went after a Demi-Saint Ghost Beast…”</p><p>“So where is this Ghost Beast?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was speechless…</p><p>“Why would there be a Demi-Saint Ghost Beast? When I first entered the Abyss Island, I didn’t sense the aura of any Demi-Saint Ghost Beast.”</p><p>A trace of anger appeared in Rao Yaoyao’s eyes. If she didn’t know that this was Number Two’s usual way of speaking, straight to the point and straight to the core…</p><p>If it were anyone else, she would think that this was a deliberate provocation and that every word was intended to pierce her heart.</p><p>However, the strange thing was that Number Two had never been so direct in the past…</p><p>“I will kill it.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao didn’t explain how the Ghost Beast came out.</p><p>There was no way to explain this matter. It would take too much time.</p><p>Number Two might understand that she needed the pressure in order to become a Saint. However if word got out to the Holy Divine Palace, it might mean something else.</p><p>“That is just your job.”</p><p>Number Two nodded and said matter-of-factly. “The situation is different now. There are traces of manipulation on the Abyss Island. There are many rats hidden here. As the leader, you should pay attention to that, rather than focus on one Demi-Saint Ghost Beast.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>” Yes, but it’s not important to just know about it. What’s important is what you’re going to do next.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s anger had already surged to the tip of her brows as she said angrily, “I’ve already committed that Demi-Saint’s Ghost Beast’s aura to memory. I’ll go and kill it now!”</p><p>“No.” Number Two shook his head. “What you need to do now is not to kill anyone, but to go to Zhen Huang Palace.”</p><p>“Zhen Huang Palace?” Rao Yaoyao was stunned.</p><p>With a flip of his hand, a pile of black hexagonal crystals appeared in his palm. He handed them over and said, “This is a gift from Hallmaster Dao for you when you became a Saint. There are 50 Void Crystals. He wants you to use your initiative…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was speechless.</p><p>At this moment, she almost drew her sword.</p><p>“If nothing happened, there are still ten days left to the countdown to exile.” Number Two paused for a moment before he continued.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s eyelids twitched.</p><p>There was indeed such a thing!</p><p>She had chased Elder Han all the way to the Azure Marsh. When she was halfway through her ‘transcend the tribulation’, this countdown to exile appeared in her mind.</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao said that he doesn’t want you to be banished to the Inner Island as soon as you became a Saint. If you go there, you won’t be able to survive. So, no matter how serious the situation is, the first thing you have to do is to go to Zhen Huang Palace and exchange for the Exemption Order. ” Number Two said lightly.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was silent. She took the Void Crystals and put them away obediently.</p><p>“What other instructions were there?”</p><p>“He wants you to report your losses.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao fell silent again. After a long time, she said, “Teng Shanhai is dead.”</p><p>Number Two didn’t seem surprised at all and asked calmly, “”Who killed him? How did he die? How did you know?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was stunned by these three questions.</p><p>After a long while, she sighed. “Demi-Saint Jiang from the Pu Xuan Jiang Clan of the Northern Region was also on the Abyss Island. Teng Shanhai humiliated this Saint. He saw the power of the Demon God and killed Teng Shanhai in front of me.”</p><p>“He did not accord you any respect…” Number Two exclaimed in surprise, but he quickly regained his composure and looked at the void.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
