(3)</p><p>It allowed one to let go of their anxiety and begin to enjoy tranquillity.</p><p>Shangri-La…</p><p>The description of Bazhun’an was not bad!</p><p>Bazhun’an looked at Kong Yuhen and continued, “The second time I saw you, it should have been a few years later when you were on the Ten High Nobles.”</p><p>“You seem to have found something, and you’re in a hurry to confirm it. At least you’re no longer so otherworldly. You have the emotions that humans should have, such as anxiety.”</p><p>“You fought your way into the War of the Ten High Nobles to challenge me.”</p><p>“Because Wen Ting said that he would come to me if he couldn’t solve the problem… Actually, Wen Ting was just afraid of death, so he threw you, this trouble, to me.”</p><p>Bazhun’an laughed and tapped the edge of the wine cup with their fingertips, recalling, “The first time I was surprised was probably at that time.”</p><p>“At that time, Wen Ting was actually very strong. He actually had someone he could not defeat… No, I should say he actually lost!”</p><p>“In fact, because of the battle with you, his mentality was affected, and he withdrew from the War of the Ten High Nobles.”</p><p>“He should still be regretting this now because you don’t belong to that era. He shouldn’t have damaged his Dao heart because of this.”</p><p>Kong Yuhen wanted to say something but hesitated.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also narrowed his eyes.</p><p>It didn’t belong to that era…</p><p>There was so much information!</p><p>He didn’t ask, quietly waiting for Bazhun’an to continue.</p><p>“When you came to find me, I was fighting Cao Yihan…” Bazhun’an paused and glanced at Xu Xiaoshou.” It’s Kui Leihan.”</p><p>“You became very fierce. You didn’t give anyone face and just wanted to fight me.”</p><p>“Cao… Kui Leihan was also a hot-tempered person. He took the initiative to attack you.”</p><p>“Spatial Upanishad should have appeared for the first time at that time. I finally understand why Wen Ting was defeated.”</p><p>Spatial Upanishad?</p><p>Apparently, Kong Yuhen’s Spatial Upanishad was very terrifying. At least, it was different from the one that Master Dean had just comprehended.</p><p>Even someone like the Seven Sword Deity Wen Ting was defeated.</p><p>Kong Yuhen finally spoke, “Spatial Upanishad?”</p><p>Bazhun’an looked over. “If I’m not mistaken, you even forgot about this?”</p><p>Kong Yuhen frowned and pondered.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt like he was really a patient.</p><p>He opened his mouth and thought of Yu Lingdi and Ye Xiaotian’s Power Upanishad Formation. He described, “That one. When you move your spiritual source and want to make a move, a formation-like thing will appear under your feet. It’s very cool.”</p><p>Kong Yuhen glanced at him and tried to raise his hand to gather that thing called spiritual source.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion suddenly lit up.</p><p>A grand Power Upanishad Formation appeared on the ground. It didn’t have any offensive power.</p><p>The light was flowing and it was beautiful.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou forgot to close his mouth at that moment. All he could see was the beautiful Power Upanishad Formation.</p><p>As expected…</p><p>This jade-faced scholar was definitely not as harmless as he looked on the surface!</p><p>Bazhun’an was also busy admiring, he stared at the formation for a long time and said, “Back then, you used this thing to fight with Kui Leihan. At first, you didn’t have the ability to use time.”</p><p>“When the battle was halfway through and even you couldn’t hold on, you used the power of time.”</p><p>“Even you are surprised by that ability because you don’t know how to use it. It seems like an innate ability.”</p><p>“Yes, but not good.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>He wasn’t stunned because Kong Yuhen had suddenly awakened the time attribute.</p><p>Instead…</p><p>What the hell was going on?</p><p>Kong Yuhen couldn’t defeat Kui Leihan with Spatial Upanishad?</p><p>What kind of peerless and fierce general was that Cao?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened his mouth, and Bazhun’an smiled at him. “Cao Yihan is the most talented Spiritual Cultivator I’ve ever seen. There’s no one else who can compare with him.”</p><p>“Perhaps, I should meet him…” Kong Yuhen murmured softly.</p><p>“You’ve met long ago.” Bazhun’an smiled and pointed at the wooden statues of the Ten High Nobles on the table. ” You’ve seen these people before. They’ve all been here, but you’ve forgotten.”</p><p>“Then I should go see him in my current state and see what answer he can give me.”</p><p>“Maybe.” Bazhun’an replied.</p><p>“What happened after that?”</p><p>Compared to where Kong Yuhen go next, Xu Xiaoshou was more curious about the War of the Ten High Nobles between the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>What Bazhun’an said would not be legends, nor would they be exaggerated. They were all things that had happened in the past.</p><p>And with Bazhun’an’s level of understanding, the things he talked about definitely wouldn’t be like the unscrupulous bards, specially mythologizing a certain character.</p><p>Because he himself was the greatest legend!</p><p>Kong Yuhen also listened attentively.</p><p>The story of Bazhun’an allowed him to know many people. These were all friends that he could visit one by one in the future.</p><p>“After that…”</p><p>“After that, you revealed your space-time dual attributes. Hmm, how should I put it? It was beyond everyone’s expectations.”</p><p>“However, it is not absolute.”</p><p>Bazhun’an glanced at Xu Xiaoshou with a smile, as if they knew that what they were about to say would be a heavy blow to this little guy.</p><p>He still looked at Kong Yuhen and said, “You’ve finally come to a draw with Kui Leihan. This surprises both you and Kui Leihan”</p><p>“But Kui Leihan doesn’t want to fight you anymore.”</p><p>“He said that he can’t defeat your space-time dual attributes at the moment. He needs a special power that can at least resist the power of the Upanishad.”</p><p>“So he stopped and let Shenyi fight you first.”</p><p>Shenyi?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced to the side and thought, suddenly remembering this person.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
