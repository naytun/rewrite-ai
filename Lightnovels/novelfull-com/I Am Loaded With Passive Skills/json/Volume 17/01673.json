(5)</p><p>“I contacted Bazhun’an to check if he’s free. I sought his help for me to break through to the Sovereign Stage; to protect me or something.”</p><p>Elder Han was initially snuggled up comfortably, but he suddenly bounced up like a cat. He was instantly energized.</p><p>What’s going on, Brother Chen?</p><p>You want to break through to the Sovereign Stage and you still want to ask the Master of the black and white veins to be your guardian?</p><p>Am I not a person? I’m here to help you keep an eye on it. Is there a need to involve anyone else…</p><p>“Beep.”</p><p>The communicator vibrated and rang.</p><p>With a crack, Elder Han’s eyes widened and he froze into an ice sculpture on the spot. Even his thoughts froze.</p><p>No way, no way, no way!</p><p>It, it was connected?</p><p>Was this really a communication device for Bazhun’an and not just a random device to contact any ordinary person?</p><p>It’s that simple?</p><p>Did he get in touch?</p><p>Impossible!</p><p>It was absolutely impossible!</p><p>“Hello?” Xu Xiaoshou was a little surprised. It was just wishful thinking on his part, but in the end… There really was a connection?</p><p>“Is this Bazhun’an?” Xu Xiaoshou raised the communicator to his ear and felt like he was in a dream.</p><p>At this moment, Elder Han really felt like he was also in a dream!</p><p>That was the Master of the black and white veins!</p><p>Even the Holy Emperor on the Inner Island couldn’t contact him. He could only wait passively for his mission.</p><p>This Brother Chen, you can contact him just by using a communicator?</p><p>Elder Han’s ears pricked up. He was in Mu Zixi’s arms, and his soul floated into the communicator in Brother Chen’s hand.</p><p>Not long after, his liver trembled as he heard a voice that he had not heard for a long time. It belonged to a demon.</p><p>At that time, he was practically prostrated on the ground. He could only secretly see that person who stepped on the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon and pointed his sword at the White Vein Third Ancestor. His tone was impudent and arrogant.</p><p>But this time, the voice was very calm.</p><p>“Come in.”</p><p>With a loud bang, Elder Han’s head went blank. He felt as if he had been struck by the Saint Calamity. It was as if illusion and reality had intertwined, and he felt as if a legend had appeared at his side.</p><p>It was Bazhun’an’s voice!</p><p>Elder Han’s eyes widened. When he came back to his senses, he realized that Brother Chen had suddenly disappeared.</p><p>There were traces of time and space around him.</p><p>It was very faint.</p><p>But did this mean that Bazhun’an had really turned up?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?” Mu Zixi panicked. Xu Xiaoshou had just raised his communicator when he disappeared.</p><p>“Where did he go?” The little girl quickly raised the little ferret in her hand and asked. It was a Demi-Saint, so it should know something.</p><p>“There’s no need to be anxious, there’s no need to be anxious…”</p><p>Elder Han consoled her repeatedly. When he personally witnessed that Brother Chen was able to contact Bazhun’an, he realized that the identities of the two young people beside him were far more precious than he had imagined!</p><p>“Old Chen… Yes, Xu Xiaoshou was only summoned by Lord Bazhun’an. He will definitely be fine. Don’t worry.”</p><p>“Summoned where?”</p><p>“I don’t know about that. How can a mere Demi-Saint like me understand the actions of Bazhun’an? But I’m sure he’ll be fine!”</p><p>Lord Bazhun’an?</p><p>A mere Demi-Saint?</p><p>Mu Zixi was stunned. This was a little different from what she understood about the world. She became confused. “You’re a Demi-Saint. And you’re also afraid of Bazhun’an? He was indeed a little scary… But he hasn’t become a Saint yet?”</p><p>Elder Han was amused when he heard this.</p><p>This was the difference between this person and other people!</p><p>Some people could only use the status of a Saint as a form of measurement.</p><p>However, there were some people who were only at the Master Stage and already had an ice-type Demi-Saint Ghost Beast under them. How could that be the same?</p><p>Elder Han thought that a person like Brother Chen would be surrounded by extraordinary people.</p><p>However, when he heard this, he immediately knew that Mu Zixi was on the same level as him. Perhaps she was a little worse than him in terms of brains.</p><p>She didn’t know Bazhun’an’s background?</p><p>And all that happened at the Inner Island?</p><p>But…</p><p>“Have you seen Lord Bazhun’an before?” Elder Han’s eyes started to roll, and his mind began to work.</p><p>“Yes.” Mu Zixi frowned and nodded. She pursed her lips and said in a disdainful tone, “He’s so sloppy. He doesn’t even have half of Xu Xiaoshou’s good looks!”</p><p>Elder Han took a deep breath.</p><p>This was a big shot!</p><p>Humans and beasts were indeed different.</p><p>Some people were brainless, but they came from a good family. Unlike a certain beast, that was considered smart but would never be able to come into contact with the elites.</p><p>Elder Han finally released his breath and squeezed out a cute expression. His tone was a little flattering.</p><p>“Little lass, don’t worry about your Xu Xiaoshou. He’ll be fine.”</p><p>“Tell me, do you have any wishes that have yet to be fulfilled?”</p><p>“Do you want to pluck the stars?”</p><p>Enter?</p><p>Enter… where?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held the communicator that had suddenly been cut off and was a little puzzled.</p><p>Suddenly, he realized that Elder Han and Mu Zixi who were behind him had disappeared and his heart skipped a beat.</p><p>But he quickly relaxed.</p><p>What a joke…</p><p>This was an anomaly synonymous with Bazhun’an!</p><p>Since he was already by his side, he would be able to hold up the sky even if it collapsed!</p><p>At this time, how good would it be if Rao Yaoyao should turn up?</p><p>It would be even better if she could bring a Demi-Saint from the Holy Divine Palace. It would be best if she could bring two of them along.</p><p>Oh, could Bazhun’an be killed by three Demi-Saints?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not sure.</p><p>However, the idea that Bazhun’an would die on the Abyss Island was something he found a bit ridiculous.</p><p>“At the very least, we need to send out a Holy Emperor to kill Bazhun’an, right?”</p><p>“This is strange. He was clearly only below the Demi-Saint realm. Why did he give off such a unique feeling? Justice will prevail…”</p><p>He did not have to search as Xu Xiaoshou quickly noticed the abnormality.</p><p>Firstly, the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff that he had tossed into the Yuan Mansion suddenly flew out.</p><p>The surrounding space and time were clearly different.</p><p>As he stepped on the Abyss Island, Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he had entered another world.</p><p>This was not an illusion!</p><p>From the chaotic space node, Xu Xiaoshou knew that what he saw with his eyes and what his body felt were completely different things.</p><p>He glanced behind him.</p><p>He still couldn’t see his junior sister.</p><p>The Time Ancestor Shadow Staff seemed to urge him to go forward. This thing was very strange because it was from Kong Yuhen.</p><p>However, when he thought of Bazhun’an who was beside him, Xu Xiaoshou felt inexplicably at ease. He mustered his courage and followed the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff forward.</p><p>“Kong Yuhen…”</p><p>“How good would it be if Kong Yuhen came out to stir some sh*t at this time?”</p><p>“At the very least, Bazhun’an should be able to deal with him, right? If he can’t do it, who else can?”</p><p>After he took a few steps, the world in front of him turned bizarre and seemed to have become chaotic. However, it gave people a feeling of stability.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked up into the distance. For some reason, he felt a sense of deja vu, as if he had been to this place in his dream…</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>“First Hall of Sins?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s hair suddenly stood on end.</p><p>He had flown far away from the First Hall of Sins. How did he end up here after he took only a few steps?</p><p>And…</p><p>There was someone there?</p><p>He turned to look.</p><p>“Shall we go in?” Xiao Kongtong hesitated for a moment, as if he had swallowed something. He looked up and checked the plaque to confirm that this was the First Hall of Sins. Then, he pushed open the door of the palace and took the lead.</p><p>“Follow me.” Mei Siren walked past him, looked back, and entered the great hall.</p><p>“I’ll go first!” Mu Zixi had appeared! She had snatched the position of the team’s belly. She did not have the guts to cover the rear!</p><p>“Then I’ll be the tank…” Xu Xiaoshou blurted out. Halfway through his words, he suddenly realized something.</p><p>Something was wrong!</p><p>Wasn’t this the scene when the four-man team first entered the First Hall of Sins?</p><p>Cycle?</p><p>Dream realm?</p><p>Spacetime?</p><p>Reincarnation?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou broke out in cold sweat. He almost thought that what he had encountered in the First Hall of Sins was fake.</p><p>However, when he looked into his mind, the death countdown had disappeared.</p><p>“Come in.”</p><p>The voice of Bazhun’an rang out from within the great hall in the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>At this moment, Bazhun’an’s voice seemed to contain a kind of calming magic.</p><p>At least, Xu Xiaoshou’s pounding heart had calmed down.</p><p>He took a deep breath and did not rush into the hall. Instead, he chose to take a step back. He looked up and rubbed his eyes before he looked at the plaque of the First Hall of Sins again.</p><p>Last time, he had followed a large group of people into the First Hall of Sins and ended up in another place.</p><p>This time…</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes came into contact with the plaque of the First Hall of Sins, he suddenly lost focus.</p><p>“All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion!”</p><p>The soles of his feet felt cold, and his skull felt as if it had been pried open. A sense of terror that originated from the unknown poured out from his brain and flowed into his heart. It was an icy cold fear.</p><p>“It turned out that the place I entered back then was the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion. It was completely different from what Master Siren and the others experienced.”</p><p>“Ancient and modern… Heh, it really has that kind of smell.”</p><p>“Forget about it… D*mn it, this will only create anxiety for others, and you still say that I’m very anxious? Who wouldn’t be anxious when they come in!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath and tightened his grip on the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff in his hand.</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>Time Ancestor Shadow Staff?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly couldn’t remember where he got this thing. He subconsciously flung it to the side hurriedly as if it was a piece of trash. It was like he held a hot potato just now.</p><p>After he did that, he felt a little more comfortable. He smiled slightly, straightened his clothes, and stepped forward. He used the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff in his hand to push open the wooden door of the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion.</p><p>“Creak!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
