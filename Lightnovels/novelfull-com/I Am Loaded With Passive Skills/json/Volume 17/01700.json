(2)</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had not been able to fully absorb the power of the treasures in his body and the various Path Principles he had comprehended.</p><p>How could it be perfectly controlled?</p><p>He couldn’t control it.</p><p>Explode.</p><p>That was the only way out for Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“What about your bounded domain?”</p><p>Bazhun’an frowned when he saw Xu Xiaoshou stop.</p><p>He had been waiting for a long time to see what Xu Xiaoshou would come up with.</p><p>The bounded domain of a Spiritual Cultivator was something that everyone was looking forward to.</p><p>“Should I show it to you?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was puzzled and looked at Kong Yuhen.</p><p>Kong Yuhen was also confused. If you want to show it. Why are you looking at me?</p><p>“It depends on you.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded.</p><p>With this sentence, it was enough.</p><p>He raised his hand again.</p><p>“Bounded domain!”</p><p>With a sizzling sound, the spiritual source in his energy reserve was called upon in an instant.</p><p>The space nodes around Xu Xiaoshou quickly outlined, and the prototype of the small world in his body transformed into a spherical barrier that was half-transparent like a bubble.</p><p>However, this thing was not big. It only formed a barrier membrane on Xu Xiaoshou’s body like a piece of clothing.</p><p>Kong Yuhen and Bazhun’an did not have time to ask more questions or question why it did not continue to grow bigger.</p><p>In the next second, their pupils constricted at the same time.</p><p>This was because after the barrier membrane was formed, everything around it had begun to become extremely unstable.</p><p>The power of various Great Paths and sacred treasures mixed, like a cauldron of elixirs about to explode…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Finally, it exploded!</p><p>With a loud explosion, the airflow was pushed away and smashed the small wooden table in front of them. The wine jugs and cups on it were swept into pieces and shot out wantonly like knives.</p><p>“Chi chi chi…”</p><p>The wooden shards unceremoniously pierced into Kong Yuhen’s chest, nose, and face, but they passed through his body.</p><p>Bazhun’an, on the other hand, had no passive defenses against these attacks.</p><p>He had always been forced to get into battle mode. Under normal circumstances, he would even pant when running.</p><p>At that moment, his earlobe, nose tip, and fingers were all cut open and injured on the spot.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The wooden window of the attic was broken.</p><p>The layout inside was thrown into disarray and shattered.</p><p>The statues of the Ten High Nobles bounced back and forth, from the table to the ceiling to the floor to the wooden ladder to the second floor…</p><p>Soon, all the important items were covered by The Power of Space-Time.</p><p>The explosion was like thunder but not rain. The destructive power was still good, and it was only like piercing a balloon.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>The two people in front were also stunned.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Bazhun’an touched the blood flowing out of his nose and stopped talking halfway. He sniffled and suddenly blew out a small wooden fragment from his nostril!</p><p>His face darkened.</p><p>“Your bounded domain is of the explosive attribute?”</p><p>Having lived for so long, Bazhun’an had never heard of anyone’s bounded domain would explode the moment it was summoned, so it was no wonder that he was unprepared.</p><p>Summoning a normal bounded domain was a Territory Skill. At the same time, it was also a method to protect ordinary people when they had to fight in densely populated areas.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s bounded domain…</p><p>Are you sure this thing won’t kill anyone?</p><p>No!</p><p>It seemed that the explosion really could not kill anyone, if that was all.</p><p>“I can accept an explosive attribute bounded domain, but isn’t this power a little weak?” Bazhun’an’s face darkened as he thought about what to say.</p><p>“Perhaps it is not an explosive attribute…” Kong Yuhen seemed deep in thought as he raised his head, “Friend, you haven’t finished condensing your bounded domain yet, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded blankly.</p><p>Indeed, he had only called forth his bounded domain. The progress bar was not even one percent of the bounded domain’s formation.</p><p>This thing just exploded?</p><p>Why?</p><p>Was it because the Great Paths contained in it were too complicated, and there were various energy forms, all of which conflicted?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his chin and began to ponder. Soon, he made a decision. His eyes brightened as he said, “Let me try again.”</p><p>“Hold on.” This time, Kong Yuhen finally understood why the guy had stopped raising his hand. “Let’s go up to the second floor first.”</p><p>Only the first floor of the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion was left in a mess. Fortunately, it was a tiny attempt and only caused minor damage.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw that many things that looked like antiques and cultural relics were broken.</p><p>He was a little flustered.</p><p>However, Kong Yuhen didn’t mention any compensation, he calmed down.</p><p>They climbed the wooden stairs to the second-floor attic, Xu Xiaoshou finally saw this mysterious place.</p><p>This place wasn’t as mysterious and illusionary as he had imagined. It was just a very simple and unadorned martial arts arena.</p><p>As the three of them stepped into this place, the arena seemed to have been activated. The ground lit up with patterns.</p><p>With a swish, Xu Xiaoshou felt that the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion had disappeared. He found himself standing in a giant kingdom filled with a beautiful, peaceful, and quiet atmosphere.</p><p>The buildings here were towering and magnificent. They were brightly colored and filled with vitality.</p><p>Except for the absence of giants, this was basically the true home of the giants.</p><p>“This is the Abyss Island?” Xu Xiaoshou hesitated.</p><p>“It’s a one-to-one simulation of Abyss Island,” Kong Yuhen explained. “Before I came…Erm, it existed before I came. I just activated it.”</p><p>So you are the one who replicated it!</p><p>Who the hell are you?</p><p>Apart from the one-to-one replica of the Abyss Island from the early days, what other worlds had been replicated in the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion?</p><p>The Shengshen Continent?</p><p>The Seven Breaks?</p><p>Did they also replicate places like the Dragon Cave and the Infernal Hell Sea?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked, but he understood that the most important thing now was to test his strange ability.</p><p>“Show it. This time, there’s no need to hold back.” Bazhun’an looked at him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
