At this moment, he was also very weak.</p><p>However, when he saw the secondary plane door…</p><p>Chi Chi, Sizzle!</p><p>The power of the Ghost Beast that erupted instantly flooded the entire world.</p><p>The scattered Ghost Beast aura turned into streams of light in the next second and suddenly stabbed the right eye of Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>“Get out of here!”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man suddenly opened his right eye, and the Three Loathsome Eyes reopened!</p><p>The three gray flowers flipped and targeted the center of the water-type Power Upanishad Formation – the golden water droplet!</p><p>At the same time, he waved his sleeve, and a golden light flew in the direction of the secondary plane door.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The moment the black lightning struck, the second true body foresaw its own death.</p><p>He was almost there!</p><p>He was clearly no longer Xu Xiaoshou from the Eighth Palace. His passive skills had also reached the Sovereign Stage.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s skill could control outsiders when he drained the body of water, but it was no longer fatal to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Eternal Vitality, High Spirits, transformation…</p><p>The various passive skills were instantly activated. Water was formed, and his Life force began to recover. The second true body also felt the recovery of its mobility.</p><p>But!</p><p>He needed just a little more!</p><p>It was just that little bit!</p><p>He only controlled his second true body for a moment and even made use of the Saint Calamity attack. He left the second true body that could not move for the moment, to the mercy of the Saint Calamity.</p><p>“I am finally going to die…”</p><p>The second true body wanted to cry.</p><p>If only he was his true body. At this time, there were still many methods and treasures that he could use.</p><p>But he was not.</p><p>He was just an unnecessary existence and should not even be here.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The black lightning exploded, and electric arcs covered his entire body.</p><p>The second true body felt that his muscles were torn. The taste of the Saint Calamity was completely different from the early stage of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity.</p><p>He slowly closed his eyes.</p><p>Presumably, the original body of the killer had ended the Perception sharing and did not want to experience the Saint Calamity at all, right?</p><p>In the next second, the second true body suddenly opened its eyes.</p><p>Something was wrong!</p><p>This Saint Calamity was very painful, but it had not reached a lethal level!</p><p>He suddenly looked up and saw that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had not shot the golden light with the intention to snatch the secondary plane door.</p><p>It was a… Space-Time Golden Talisman!</p><p>The Space-Time Golden Talisman swallowed the Saint Calamity’s black lightning, but it was obviously not powerful enough. The black lightning shattered the talisman.</p><p>However, its power had also weakened.</p><p>When it landed on the second true body, the amount of calamity was not enough to kill him!</p><p>“The Five Decays of Heaven and Man is also afraid of Yu Lingdi?”</p><p>“He’s also afraid of the Cutting Path Stage of the Water-type Upanishad?”</p><p>The second true body suddenly had an enlightenment.</p><p>No matter what, at least he understood the strong signals from the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>Cooperation!</p><p>He used his Perception.</p><p>On the other side, after it absorbed the power of the Ghost Beast, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man could reactivate the Three Loathsome Eyes again.</p><p>He faced the golden drop of water and formed the Mind-Changing Aperture.</p><p>“Pa!”</p><p>At this moment, blood gathered in the chest of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and turned into a bloody hand that broke out of his chest.</p><p>In addition to having caused harm, the bloodied water seemed unwilling to be left out. It bent its palm into a claw and stabbed at the right eye of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>The five claws pierced into the right eye of Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>Even the Five Decays of Heaven and Man did not expect this.</p><p>“The Three Loathsome Eyes are gone?”</p><p>The second true body felt his eyelids twitch wildly. He could empathize with the pain of being blinded.</p><p>With a Sizzle, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man suddenly dissolved into countless Decay Qi.</p><p>He couldn’t care less about this member of Yama!</p><p>The second true body shifted its attention and pulled out the Buddha Slaying Blade… This saber did not have a scabbard.</p><p>He held the golden blade with his right hand and hid it under his arms. He positioned it from under his armpit and pressed his thumb against the Buddha Slaying Blade’s hilt. His target was the golden water drop.</p><p>“Blade Strike!”</p><p>His eyebrows furrowed, and his aura was hidden within the blade.</p><p>He raised his thumb and revealed the blade that was about the width of two fingers.</p><p>With a boom, a golden sword light flew out from the second true body.</p><p>In the first second, this sword light lit up the second true body.</p><p>In the next second, it had already cut through the center of the golden water droplet.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>The golden water droplet split into two!</p><p>However, the left half had merged into the ankle-deep water field that had been formed by the rain.</p><p>The water turned golden, like a gravitational field that sucked people down.</p><p>The right half’s morph forms turned into a water-type Clone illusion.</p><p>Young, handsome, and extraordinary.</p><p>Yu Lingdi!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you’ve grown up.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s water-type Clone appeared and smiled at Xu Xiaoshou’s second true body.</p><p>He simply hooked his hand.</p><p>The heavy golden water that rained from the Nine Heavens settled on the motionless Ye Xiao and threw her into the secondary plane door.</p><p>The Saint Calamity suddenly lost its ‘transcend the tribulation’ goal. It seemed to be momentarily stunned, then it disappeared…</p><p>Disappeared?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t believe it. The secondary plane door had such a magical effect that it could even stop the Demi-Saint’s tribulation?</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s water-type Clone was still calm. It seemed to have everything under his control.</p><p>“The show ends here.”</p><p>“If we continue, it would be a little too much.”</p><p>“You can’t kill Ye Xiao, I said…”</p><p>He raised his hand and ordered solemnly, “Secondary plane door, distort! ”</p><p>Weng!</p><p>The space in the First Hall of Sins began to distort.</p><p>This was a very familiar feeling. Xu Xiaoshou had experienced it before.</p><p>The last time the space distorted, he was transported to Ye Xiao’s side and entered the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes.</p><p>So, this could be controlled?</p><p>He could also master this ability after he mastered the secondary plane door?</p><p>Or could it be that it was also influenced by Yu Lingdi the last time?</p><p>“Trying to run?”</p><p>“Did you get my permission?”</p><p>A large amount of decadent energy suddenly emerged from the field of golden water.</p><p>Two heavy, giant hands of decay that were stained with the color of the golden water suddenly broke out of the water. The palms slammed together and headed in the direction of Yu Lingdi.</p><p>“I’ve seen you already. Who can from hide from my Upanishad power?” Yu Lingdi chuckled and temporarily stopped the control of the secondary plane door.</p><p>With his current ability, he couldn’t control a supreme treasure like the secondary plane door when he faced an enemy. He had to focus fully.</p><p>He slowly extended two fingers and hooked them gently.</p><p>“Swish… swish…”</p><p>On the ground, the field of golden water that was formed by the rainwater suddenly converged at a certain point. Then, it was like a compressed castle that pushed inward and upward.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s body, that was hidden somewhere, was pushed out and flew into the sky. His eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was also stunned.</p><p>This Cutting Path Water-type Upanishad had such a strong Perception?</p><p>He couldn’t even tell where the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had hidden himself!</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s right eye had not been blinded, and the Three Loathsome Eyes were not damaged either. Clearly, they had used some method to avoid the damage just now.</p><p>As soon as he rose into the air, he regained his strength and twisted his head. The Mind-changing Aperture once again faced Yu Lingdi.</p><p>“Dream on!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi placed his palms together and pressed down lightly.</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>At this moment, the battlefield fell silent.</p><p>Blood suddenly spurted from the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s mouth, but did not leave any traces of it on his body. It even turned into a heavy golden hammer in the void and smashed his withered body into the golden water fort underneath.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The water fort contracted and the power of the massive body of water seemed to shatter everything inside, but no more blood seeped out.</p><p>The blood of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had already been sucked dry and stopped in the air.</p><p>“The good show is over.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi snorted. He wasn’t interested in Xu Xiaoshou. He was only interested in the supreme treasures from the Abyss Island that he had just obtained.</p><p>“Secondary plane door, Distortion!”</p><p>He gave another order.</p><p>The space in the First Hall of Sins was once again distorted.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s figure turned into an illusion and his outline gradually disappeared.</p><p>At this moment, a black and white Reborn lily suddenly bloomed under his feet. It was huge, enchanting, and beautiful.</p><p>“Who told you to run?”</p><p>“So what if you’re a Water-type Upanishad?”</p><p>“Divine retribution, Heart Shattering Dao!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
