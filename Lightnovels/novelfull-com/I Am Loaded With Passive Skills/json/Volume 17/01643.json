Sometimes, people couldn’t see their goals even if they tried their best. Sometimes, smart people would fall for a simple move.</p><p>“It’s all a matter of time and fate!”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man could not help but sigh. 70% of the credit for his success was actually attributed to that little girl who suddenly attacked.</p><p>She helped him control Jiang Buyi so that Jiang Buyi would not snatch the spatial ring.</p><p>It also helped to scare Ye Xiao, preventing her from considering whether the spatial ring was a trap for a short period of time.</p><p>The name Mu Zixi was familiar to him.</p><p>He also felt that her pale little face was familiar.</p><p>However, the Demon God Eye greatly exceeded everyone’s expectations.</p><p>And this was also the real reason why the entire scene was under control, and even Jiang Buyi could not react in time!</p><p>Of the four people present, one was a high-ranking official of the Saint God Hall, one was the culprit of the Lei family’s tragedy, one was a member of the King of Hell who was always searching for the Lei family’s eye, and the last one possessed the Lei family’s most supreme Divine Demon Eye.</p><p>These four people couldn’t be said to be completely unrelated to the surname ‘Lei’. It could only be said that they were extremely closely related to each other!</p><p>In fact, all four of them knew.</p><p>Back then, Dao Xuanji had led a large group of people to destroy the Lei Family. Firstly, it was for the Lei Family’s authority and the power of punishment. Secondly, it was for the Lei Family’s Eyes.</p><p>And among the Lei Family’s Eyes, the Demon God Eye was undoubtedly ranked first. It contained the power of two ancestral sources.</p><p>In the end, he failed!</p><p>The Lei family had been destroyed, and very few had managed to escape.</p><p>However, the Demon God Eye was still transferred away, and its whereabouts were unknown.</p><p>And now, this pair of Supreme Eyes, which countless people had coveted for countless years, had mysteriously appeared on Void Island, Sin Hall, and a little girl.</p><p>What did he mean by “searching through iron shoes”?</p><p>Even at that time, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man directly abandoned his first move against Ye Xiao.</p><p>After he used the Triple-Loathe Pupils to control Mu Zixi, he hooked his hand, and a smile almost spilled out from under the mask!</p><p>“Come here.”</p><p>Mu Zixi was like a puppet, numbly listening to the command and flying in the direction of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>“Who dares to touch her!”</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Buyi’s entire body was covered in demonic Qi. His eyes were bloodshot, but he was still able to roar in anger. His words contained supreme holy power, and his roar froze the time and space on the scene for a moment.</p><p>Or was it that a Half-Saint was still a Half-Saint?</p><p>Mu Zixi’s Demon God Eye was strong, and so was the Extreme Devil. However, she was only at the King Level Dao Realm. It was not easy for her to control a Half-Saint for a moment.</p><p>After Jiang Buyi struggled to regain his senses, he did not even bother with the Devil Qi entangling himself and directed all his anger towards the Five Decays of Heaven and Man like a madman.</p><p>He was furious!</p><p>Demon God Eye!</p><p>This was the Demon God Eye!</p><p>He, Jiang Buyi, had dreamed of it and had searched for it for many years to no avail. He even released the Three Loathing Pupils as bait to bring out the real big fish. He thought that it was highly likely that it was the Demon God Eye that had fallen into the hands of King Yama…</p><p>It turned out that it had been following closely behind him.</p><p>“I’m so angry!”</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Buyi’s intestines turned green with regret. He was filled with anger and remorse.</p><p>He was thinking that if he had chosen to attack the forbidden puppet the moment he encountered it, perhaps this little girl would have to use the God-Devil Eye to save her life.</p><p>Then his dream would have come true a day ago – obtaining the Demon God Eye and the power of the Ancestral Source!</p><p>Why did he have to fall to this point where the Demon God Eye had to appear in the sights of various factions?</p><p>He, Jiang Buyi, had been put on the “Banished Countdown” and could not attack casually.</p><p>However, this did not mean that he really could not make a move. It was just that there was a limit. Once he made a move, the countdown might be reduced … That’s all!</p><p>It was just “that”!</p><p>For the sake of the Demon God Eye, what was the big deal of risking being banished a few times?</p><p>“Get back here!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi had completely forgotten about the banishment countdown in his mind. With a bang, he released his Saintly Being and turned into a fairy-coloured flowing cloud.</p><p>In his eyes, this forbidden puppet originally followed him, so it belonged to him.</p><p>Even a Half-Saint regarded it as a forbidden item, so how could a mortal touch it?</p><p>Even if that person was the Heavenly Five Decays of Heaven and Man that Jiang Buyi feared the most.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>At this moment, the light from the Immortal Flowing Cloud lit up the dark and gloomy Sin Palace.</p><p>At the same time, between Mu Zixi and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, a barrier of flowing clouds that seemed to have existed since birth appeared out of thin air.</p><p>The flowing cloud separated the two sides, reaching the top of Sin Hall and deep into the ground.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
