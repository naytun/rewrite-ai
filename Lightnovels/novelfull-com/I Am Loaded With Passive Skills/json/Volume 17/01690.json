(5)</h1><p>1690 Crazy Half-Saint, Three Tribulation Eyes, Buried Together! (5)</p><p>Huang Quan nodded and was about to speak.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Zhen Huang Palace’s great array collapsed as if it had been stomped by a giant.</p><p>“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”</p><p>Four black giant shadows flew in from the outside. They looked like black calamity clouds or meteorites that had fallen from the sky.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Huang Quan looked at them.</p><p>Those four things were none other than Void Attendants!</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Their beast-like roars echoed violently around.</p><p>These four black Void Attendants that had been thrown in from outside only needed to turn their heads in mid-air to find their target.</p><p>Their meteor-like fists were raised as they landed. The Void Attendants that smashed their way down from the sky sought their target, Huang Quan.</p><p>“Whoosh.”</p><p>Huang Quan took out a Space- Time Golden Talisman and threw it out casually.</p><p>With a whoosh, the furious Void Attendants were sucked into the Space-Time Golden Talisman before they could even complete their attacks.</p><p>“Ha, little tricks…”</p><p>Only then did Huang Quan’s cold laughter ring out.</p><p>The Space-Time Golden Talisman that floated in front of him suddenly shattered. It was as if four Thunder Calamity exploded in his face.</p><p>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”</p><p>“What was it?”</p><p>Huang Quan’s pupils trembled, and with a Swish disappeared into the second spacetime.</p><p>However, after the Space-time Golden Talisman exploded, a thick black calamity cloud exploded from within. It blurred everyone’s spiritual senses and engulfed the entire Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>“Holy Light of Saints!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s inhuman laughter sounded outside the great hall.</p><p>“Swish! Swish! Swish!”</p><p>Endless black beams of light that carried strong destructive power emerged from the black calamity clouds in Zhen Huang Palace. They shot out in all directions in a haphazard manner.</p><p>Swish, swish.</p><p>The space, pillars, and decorations at Zhen Huang Palace… All of them were shattered!</p><p>With a loud thud, the great hall could not bear the weight and started to collapse.</p><p>The falling rocks rolled about with a thunderous sound. In the process of falling, they were slashed by the black light beam and crumbled into powder.</p><p>“Jiang Buyi, are you crazy?!”</p><p>Huang Quan fled desperately.</p><p>Under the onslaught of Jiang Buyi’s crazy attacks, his Hidden spacetime could not keep up the defense for long. He had to change several times in a breath.</p><p>An attack of this level…</p><p>It was not difficult to see that Jiang Buyi had gone completely berserk!</p><p>He would attack with all his strength and kill Huang Quan here!</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>A maniacal laugh resounded throughout the entire place.</p><p>Jiang Buyi, who stood outside the great hall had used his Holy Realm to completely seal this space, lowered his head and trembled.</p><p>“You forced me to do this!”</p><p>“I told you not to be too extreme. Give me a way out, and I won’t fall out with you.”</p><p>“But since you’re so heartless, then all of you shall die here!”</p><p>“I will not spare any one!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi, who was being held in the hands of the Mei Siren like a chicken, was frightened.</p><p>Jiang Buyi even wanted to kill him?</p><p>This was clearly an indiscriminate area attack that did not differentiate between friend and foe. He was going to kill everyone in Zhen Huang Palace!</p><p>“Rumble… Rumble…”</p><p>The great hall collapsed around them.</p><p>Mei Siren was already covered in blood.</p><p>The Sword Image was huge and could shelter them from most of the Holy Light of Saints.</p><p>However, some black beams of light shot out from remote corners, and even Mei Siren couldn’t react in time.</p><p>On the other hand, Yu Lingdi, under his protection, was not injured by the Holy Light of Saints at all.</p><p>Mei Siren’s face was filled with anger.</p><p>“Throw Yu Lingdi!”</p><p>Huang Quan’s voice suddenly sounded.</p><p>“Jiang Buyi has already gone mad. He wants to keep us here.”</p><p>“He’s very smart! This time, if he went all out, he would suspend the countdown to exile and at most be banished for another ten days.”</p><p>“If we don’t die, he’ll have to go into hiding and have no peace.”</p><p>“But if we die, he can use these ten days to find a new way to survive or escape from the Abyss Island.”</p><p>“So, run first!”</p><p>Huang Quan was too calm.</p><p>He always remembered that a Demi-Saint was not to be trifled with, even though Jiang Buyi had lost a Demi-Saint Incarnation under his Hun Che move.</p><p>However, when a Demi-Saint went crazy, everyone had to give way!</p><p>From the start to the end, Huang Quan’s plan was not to fight head-on with Jiang Buyi.</p><p>Instead, he made use of the Abyss Island’s banishment power and his space attributes as a guide to kill the Saint from the side.</p><p>So…</p><p>When Jiang Buyi was weak, Huang Quan was extremely hard.</p><p>However, if Jiang Buyi was tough, Huang Quan could not afford to be weak. It was best to leave!</p><p>At this moment…</p><p>Without a doubt, Huang Quan’s plan had succeeded.</p><p>Jiang Buyi had gone completely mad. When he made such a move, he must have re-imposed the countdown to exile.</p><p>In that case, whether he, Huang Quan and Mei Siren could survive the next ten days or not, or whether they could use the ‘hit and run’ tactic to force Jiang Buyi to make a move and reduce his countdown to zero, would be the question.</p><p>Of course, in order for this question to be valid, it would be based on whether the two of them could survive in the hands of Jiang Buyi, who had gone mad at this moment.</p><p>“You, pray for yourself.”</p><p>Mei Siren clearly understood this principle and threw out the severely injured Yu Lingdi without hesitation.</p><p>Swish.</p><p>At the same time, the Holy Light of Saints stopped abruptly.</p><p>Huang Quan’s eyelids that were hidden under his mask, twitched.</p><p>Wrong call?</p><p>Jiang Buyi had not suspended his countdown to exile?</p><p>He just pretended to be furious and wanted to take Yu Lingdi away amid the chaos?</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>A cold light flashed in Huang Quan’s eyes.</p><p>No matter what, with a flick of his finger, he was going to kill Yu Lingdi here and wipe out all possibilities.</p><p>His original intention was to use Yu Lingdi as bait.</p><p>If Yu Lingdi lived, he would definitely not let Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi’s combat strength out of the Abyss Island. He would give orders continuously and make full use of him</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
