Due to it not being as destructive, fatal, and disgusting as the Voodoo Body, it was eventually removed from the Five Extreme Physiques.</p><p>“Ultimate Life Demon Physique?”</p><p>Ye Xiao knew that she had been careless.</p><p>The possibility that the spatial ring was a trap had never even crossed her mind at that time!</p><p>Or to put it another way, the moment she pounced over to snatch it on a whim, she suddenly felt that something was wrong.</p><p>However, the appearance of the God Devil Eyes interrupted her subsequent thoughts. After her puppet body was invaded by the Lord of Calamity, even her main body was injected with an endless energy of decay.</p><p>“You will die an unnatural death!”</p><p>At that time, the words of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man sounded like child’s play. Now when she recalled what he said, it was almost a prophecy.</p><p>Ye Xiao couldn’t take it anymore.</p><p>Her original body was the three-legged black owl. After being injected with a large amount of decadent Qi, the omen uttered by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man seemed to have reached the peak.</p><p>At this moment, she could not even maintain her human form. She could only transform into an illusion of a phantom-like three-legged black owl.</p><p>The black owl’s feathers had lost its luster and was stained with the dust that represented the withering of the Great Path.</p><p>Its body was covered in pus, and it smelt like a corpse that had rotted in a smelly ditch for more than ten days. It was disgusting.</p><p>It was difficult to maintain one’s thoughts due to the violent emotions that went through one’s mind.</p><p>Ye Xiao was a taciturn type of person, who was always deep in thought.</p><p>At this moment, she would not be like Jiang Buyi and lose her mind while in a state of total collapse.</p><p>Even so…</p><p>When Ye Xiao regained her senses, the first thing she saw was her mortal enemy, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man being attacked by Mu Zixi, who had the God Devil Eyes. Her body had turned into vines that pierced him.</p><p>Her thoughts became extremely profound!</p><p>“Wood attribute…”</p><p>“Life-devouring Wood Physique? No, Ultimate Life Demon Physique?”</p><p>“God Devil Eyes. She still has the God Devil Eyes…”</p><p>“Dao Xuanji destroyed the Lei family but could not find the God Devil Eyes. There’s a high chance that this pair of eyes would only appear on the ‘orphan’ of the Lei family.”</p><p>“Ultimate Life Demon Physique… If she still has the Ultimate Life Demon Physique…”</p><p>“Did Dao Xuanji destroy the Ultimate Life Demon Physique?”</p><p>“There’s something familiar… Something is not quite right… What am I thinking…”</p><p>Ye Xiao’s dark eyes suddenly became chaotic.</p><p>Perhaps it was due to the influence of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s Tribulation; perhaps it was due to the various memory fragments that reappeared when she was on the verge of death.</p><p>Ye Xiao knew that she did not have long to live and could not hold on for much longer.</p><p>However, at this moment, a spiritual light flashed in her mind. She finally grasped what the familiar feeling was.</p><p>“Ultimate Life Demon Physique!”</p><p>“Yes, I remember that there was a person in the Yunlun Mountain Range who had the Ultimate Life Demon Physique.”</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao sent you to look for her in order to verify this conjecture. Now that you’re dead, Rao Yaoyao had completely forgotten about this matter…”</p><p>“I’m the one who harmed you. It’s me! But I won’t forget, I’ll always remember!”</p><p>Ye Xiao’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>“Mu Zixi, Mu Zixi…”</p><p>“Xu Deye, Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>“Ha! Ha! Ha!”</p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao almost collapsed.</p><p>Even if there was no theoretical basis for this, she believed in her intuition.</p><p>There was a slim chance that the God Devil Eyes was lost, but the greatest possibility was that it was with the orphan of the Lei family!</p><p>There was a 10% chance that the Ultimate Life Demon Physique had emerged on the other side of the continent. The last time it appeared was in the Lei family!</p><p>Now, these two iconic things had appeared on a little girl. Was it just a coincidence?</p><p>Ye Xiao did not believe in coincidences!</p><p>She was immediately certain that Mu Zixi was Mu Zixi.</p><p>If that was the case, Young Master Xu of the First Pavilion of Deva was the Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Everything is real!”</p><p>The truth had always been right under everyone’s noses. It had been pushed out more than once.</p><p>It was just that there were too many major events hidden in this truth.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao couldn’t stop him. Her attention was completely focused on Bazhun’an and the Abyss Island.</p><p>As long as she had the determination to dig deeper and discover the truth, she would be able to solve the mystery of Yi’s strange death first!</p><p>It was logical that everything she wanted could be related.</p><p>All the unknown mysteries would be solved.</p><p>But she did not!</p><p>Ye Xiao looked at Mu Zixi. The hatred in her eyes turned into a turbulent wave that overflowed with violence.</p><p>At this moment, she felt that the entire world was at fault.</p><p>Even when Rao Yaoyao came, Ye Xiao wanted to kill her!</p><p>Ye Xiao figured that if her deduction was correct, the anomaly would be the moment she died was the moment she discovered the truth!</p><p>What kind of truth was it that one could not even send out a signal before one died?</p><p>This was impossible!</p><p>However, since it was impossible, the only explanation left was that she was desperate to wipe out a certain shocking secret that she had discovered!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
