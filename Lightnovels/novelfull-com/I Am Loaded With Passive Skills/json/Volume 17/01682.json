(4)</p><p>“The one in ‘Godhood called a god at the gates of hell’?”</p><p>“Legend has it that he fought his way to the gates of hell for a woman and snatched his wife’s soul back from the hands of the god of death?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou found it funny as he spoke.</p><p>Sometimes, he felt that the stories made up by the wandering bards were too unreliable.</p><p>In order to deify certain people, they would deliberately make up some ridiculous things.</p><p>How could someone who could participate in the Ten High Nobles be a simple person?</p><p>Wouldn’t a story like this weaken the “the scent of a woman”, and force her everything onto the “kill the mortal world and defeat the ghosts”?</p><p>Yes, it was the line after the first line in the Songs of the Ten High Nobles…</p><p>“Gou Wuyue, the scent of a woman, kill the mortal world and defeat the ghosts.”</p><p>It was very unrealistic!</p><p>The Bazhun’an looked at Xu Xiaoshou’s doubtful expression and shook their heads with a smile.</p><p>“You are wrong.”</p><p>“Those aren’t legends, they’re all true.”</p><p>“In fact, the legends that you have heard should have weakened the combat ability of Shenyi in all aspects as much as possible for the sake of the so-called ‘authenticity’ and ‘widespread dissemination’.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>The Bazhun’an continued:</p><p>“Xiang Yaoyao died at that time. You killed her.” He looked at the empty space with hatred.</p><p>“Shenyi was still with me at that time. Kui Leihan wanted Shenyi to fight you first because he recognized Shenyi’s strength.”</p><p>“But Xiang Yaoyao was afraid and refused to let Shenyi do it.”</p><p>“In the War of the Ten High Nobles, he’s the only one who has mastered Spatial Upanishad and the time attribute. Who wouldn’t be afraid of him?”</p><p>The Bazhun’an stared at Kong Yuhen’s embarrassed expression and jumped out of the story with a face full of emotion.</p><p>“It’s very difficult to see you in such a dignified manner. I think this gentle appearance shouldn’t last long.”</p><p>“As soon as Xiang Yaoyao opened her mouth, you killed her and exiled her soul before anyone could react to your Spatial Upanishad.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s jaw dropped.</p><p>Ah, this…</p><p>The Bazhun’an looked over.</p><p>“She’s indeed a noob. I reckon you can beat her now.”</p><p>“At that time, Xiang Yaoyao had just broken through to the Sovereign Dao Realm. She was brought here by Shenyi for sightseeing and was a battle idiot.”</p><p>“But neither was Shenyi.”</p><p>“If Cao Yihan is the most talented Spiritual Cultivator I’ve ever seen, then Shenyi is the most talented in physical arts.”</p><p>The Bazhun’an looked at Kong Yuhen again.</p><p>“During the War of the Ten High Nobles, not to mention you who didn’t belong to that era, no one grasped the true power of the Upanishad.”</p><p>“However, if the Upanishad of physical arts can be displayed in the form of a formation, Shenyi should be the only one in the world who has mastered the Upanishad.”</p><p>“You killed Shenyi’s true love, of course, he’s furious.”</p><p>“Spatial Upanishad, temporal abilities… In front of an envious brute, he couldn’t even stir up a bit of wave.”</p><p>Kong Yuhen’s face turned red, he asked, “Why me?”</p><p>“You were hammered by him.” The Bazhun’an laughed.</p><p>“Kui Leihan and you fought to a draw, but you couldn’t withstand Shenyi’s attack. Your body was smashed on the spot, and your soul was pulled out and cut into pieces.”</p><p>“Fortunately, Shenyi doesn’t care about you at all. He just wanted to save people.”</p><p>“So, he carried the two High Nobles and fought his way into the gates of hell. He didn’t forget to put them down because they were the wedding gifts he promised Xiang Yaoyao.”</p><p>“Shenyi can summon the gates of hell himself. Once the Hungry Ghost Realm opens, he really rushed into the door.”</p><p>“Just when everyone thought that Shenyi would never come back, he found all of Xiang Yaoyao’s remaining souls. One day later, he fought his way back from the gates of hell.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind suddenly went blank.</p><p>This was too surreal!</p><p>It was even more fantastical and ridiculous than the legendary story of “Godhood called a god at the gates of hell” that he knew.</p><p>It was too real, but it was ridiculous!</p><p>The Bazhun’an drank another cup of wine, and after they had refilled their cups, they continued, “Fortunately, Shenyi didn’t kill you completely at that time. It was also because of the spatial attribute.”</p><p>“In just a moment, after you recover, you will be able to replace yourself in the river of time.”</p><p>“You seemed to have found your answer and wanted to go back.”</p><p>“But Kui Leihan woke up.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyebrows twitched. He could vaguely feel that the plot was about to develop towards an outrageous direction.</p><p>“I never flatter anyone, but it is true that Kui Leihan’s talent for Spiritual Cultivation is the highest in the modern world.”</p><p>“He felt that he needed something like that to be able to fight someone like you who has two attributes in space-time.”</p><p>“So he sat down to comprehend. In the time that Shenyi also scattered you, he woke up and challenged you again.”</p><p>“I accepted?” Kong Yuhen seemed to understand his choice.</p><p>“Of course, you were also a person who refuses to admit defeat. Cao Yihan, that fellow…”</p><p>The Bazhun’an snorted, “Just a moment ago, they could only fight to a draw with you. How could they possibly defeat you after meditating?”</p><p>“Then I got hammered again?” Kong Yuhen seemed to have foreseen the future… oh no, the past.</p><p>“Ha … Uh, yes.”</p><p>The Bazhun’an almost laughed out loud. After glancing at Xu Xiaoshou, their expressions became extremely serious again.</p><p>“Cao Yihan sat down for less than the time it takes for an incense stick to burn. After he got up, he displayed an extremely powerful ability.”</p><p>“One move and he broke Kong Yuhen’s Spatial Upanishad and killed him.”</p><p>“He named this ability ‘Penetrating Divine Senses’ after that, and then named his version of Penetrating Divine Senses ‘God Punishment Tribulation’.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
