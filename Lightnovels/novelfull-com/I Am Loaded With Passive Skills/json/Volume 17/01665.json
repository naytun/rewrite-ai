(2)</p><p>Yu Lingdi clutched his head tightly and his expression was unfathomable. He could only endure the intense pain in his head as he tried his best to digest the information contained in these words.</p><p>Ye Xiao seemed to be very anxious. She pursed her lip a few times and then curled up and changed into a three-legged black owl with a bang.</p><p>After she took a deep breath, she returned to her human form.</p><p>“Remember, be quick. Send the message back, but don’t… pass it to Rao Yaoyao!”</p><p>“Send the information back to the Holy Divine Palace!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi took a deep breath and nodded silently.</p><p>Ye Xiao seemed to want to say something and opened her mouth.</p><p>“I understand.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi couldn’t stand it anymore. He stopped her, grimaced in pain and said, “I know the rest. The Five Decays of Heaven and Man, the Ghost Beast Host Body, Yama and Demi-Saint Jiang, they all have to… ”</p><p>At the door, Jiang Buyi’s face twitched twice.</p><p>“Cough… cough!”</p><p>He coughed lightly and did not dare to listen anymore. He walked into the hall.</p><p>Both Yu Lingdi and Ye Xiao’s bodies stiffened at the same time. Their heads seemed to weigh a ton as they lifted them with difficulty.</p><p>The three of them looked at each other.</p><p>Jiang Buyi pondered for a moment and took the initiative to speak, “I didn’t hear anything. You guys continue your conversation.”</p><p>He walked past the two sickly Spiritual Cultivators and stopped in front of the giant statue.</p><p>It was very different from what he had seen before.</p><p>At this moment, the giant statue no longer looked like a statue. The armor on its body had a luster, and the spider webs in the cracks seemed to have been cleared away.</p><p>Not only that, but it also stood up straight and held the trident in its hand at an angle. It was raised as if it had already experienced a battle.</p><p>“What happened here exactly…”</p><p>Jiang Buyi thought of the bestial roars he heard on the way to the Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>Perhaps it was the Void General.</p><p>But what did this mean?</p><p>Jiang Buyi did not understand.</p><p>He couldn’t even understand how Ye Xiao had appeared here!</p><p>However, none of this was important. The exemption order was the one that mattered most. As long as he could exchange for the command token, what kind of mystery could he not solve on his own?</p><p>“I want to exchange for an exemption order.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi looked at the tall Void General and said. At the same time, he handed over the 50 Void Crystals that had flown over.</p><p>The great hall fell silent.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was used to the Void General’s speech pattern and he knew it was always slow to speak.</p><p>But this time, even after he waited for a long time, the Void General did not respond.</p><p>“I want to exchange for one exemption order!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s tone was a little forceful and he even stuttered as he imitated the Void General’s speaking style.</p><p>There was still no response.</p><p>“Demi- Saint Jiang.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi, who was lying on the ground, suddenly propped up his body and turned his head to look at him, his expression grim.</p><p>“What if I tell you that the exemption order had already been exchanged by someone else? What would you do?”</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Buyi’s pupils trembled as he turned around.</p><p>“You! Tell me! What! Eh?”</p><p>He grabbed Yu Lingdi’s neck and raised him up, his eyes nearly about to pop out.</p><p>Da… da… da…</p><p>Blood dripped from Yu Lingdi’s limp and powerless lower body. This expert of the younger generation who was controlled by others, laughed out loud.</p><p>He opened his mouth wide.</p><p>“I said, the exemption order is gone!”</p><p>“You’re bullsh*tting!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi exerted some strength in his hand and directly tightened his grip around Yu Lingdi’s neck.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s eyeballs had already protruded from the pain, and now they almost popped out.</p><p>“Kill me, and then you’ll die.”</p><p>“Or, cooperate with me, and you live. Then, we can write off all our previous debts.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi was not afraid at all. He looked directly at Jiang Buyi with a ferocious look until the other party released his grip and set him down and spoke in an amiable tone.</p><p>“How do we go about this?”</p><p>There was a Swish sound!</p><p>Yu Lingdi freed up both hands and took out a command token each. On it was the word ‘Chase’, crossed out diagonally.</p><p>“Cough!”</p><p>“These are the last two exemption orders.”</p><p>“Take them. You, Jiang Buyi, accept the temporary conscription of the Holy Divine Palace.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi suddenly reached out, but Yu Lingdi seemed to be prepared. The two command tokens suddenly fell into the water and merged into his palms.</p><p>“Hand it over!” Jiang Buyi shouted.</p><p>“Once there is an act of robbery, it will be followed by another.” Yu Lingdi said indifferently.</p><p>Jiang Buyi blushed immediately.</p><p>He didn’t know what Yu Lingdi was talking about.</p><p>“Hand me the command token. We can discuss the details of our cooperation later.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi said gently as he glanced at the injuries of the two people in front of him, “At least I have recovered. I will help you heal your injuries. It will not be a problem for you to regain your peak condition.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi clenched four fingers on both hands, and the two exemption orders reappeared.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s eyes flashed with a fierce light when he heard what Yu Lingdi said.</p><p>“You can kill me and take the command token, but when I die, they will turn into a puddle of useless water. Trust me, trust the Water-type Upanishad.”</p><p>“Are you threatening me?” Jiang Buyi asked coldly.</p><p>Yu Lingdi looked at him quietly and suddenly exerted force with his left hand.</p><p>“Pa!”</p><p>The exemption order shattered into spiritual light and turned into a puddle of water that flowed through his fingers.</p><p>“Now, there’s only one exemption order left.”</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Buyi’s heart felt like a beast that had been released. He subconsciously wanted to explode and tear this young man into pieces.</p><p>He had never experienced such a strong feeling of helplessness.</p><p>It was the same when he met the Five Decays of Heaven and Man; Jiang Buyi knew he couldn’t afford to act recklessly and had to speak nicely.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
