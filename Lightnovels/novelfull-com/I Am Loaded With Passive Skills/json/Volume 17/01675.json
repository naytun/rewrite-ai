(2)</p><p>However, for the sake of the exemption order, Jiang Buyi went all out.</p><p>Although his speed was slow, he still grabbed at Yu Lingdi’s arm that had been cut off by Huang Quan.</p><p>“Got it!”</p><p>“This isn’t the deep sea. When my strength returns, Huang Quan will be dead!”</p><p>Arm…</p><p>It was so close!</p><p>Jiang Buyi exerted his strength and grabbed Yu Lingdi’s severed arm. That was the exemption order that he had been dreaming of.</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>The sword hummed.</p><p>Chi Chi Chi!</p><p>Sword energy shot out in all directions.</p><p>It bypassed Jiang Buyi and cut the severed arm into a thousand pieces!</p><p>“This…” Jiang Buyi’s pupils trembled as he looked back in a daze. His old face was filled with disbelief.</p><p>They… made their moves?</p><p>I did not even dare to reveal my aura.</p><p>In the midst of the Saint Calamity, how could you, Mei Siren, dare to draw your sword on the spot?</p><p>Huang Quan was also shocked by his companion’s actions.</p><p>He didn’t put up any protection for Mei Siren!</p><p>Under the Saint Calamity, if the old Sword Deity really made a move, he would definitely be targeted by the Saint Calamity… Had he been tempted? He also wanted to forcefully pass the Saint Calamity?</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>As expected, the Nine Heavens Thunder Calamity raged and expanded.</p><p>The aura of calamity locked onto Mei Siren, who had launched that reckless attack. They saw this as a provocation!</p><p>Mei Siren held his fan and looked up at the sky. There was no fear in his eyes as he calmly said.</p><p>“You go ahead and kill Jiang Buyi.”</p><p>“You don’t have to worry about being targeted by the Saint Calamity. As long as I don’t die, you won’t be affected… However, we can’t stall for too long.”</p><p>“You should get rid of the problem as soon as possible to avoid any accidents!”</p><p>With that, Mei Siren leaped up and flew into the sky.</p><p>Huang Quan was stunned as he stood rooted to the spot.</p><p>This was such a reckless man?</p><p>Were all ancient Swordsmen like this?</p><p>But…</p><p>Shouldn’t Master Siren be full of affinity?</p><p>You’re completely different from the way of enlightenment you practiced in the Abandoned Dimension Hall… No, there seemed to be some connection?</p><p>If the person could not be taught, he would kill it?</p><p>“You want to become a Saint?” Huang Quan still couldn’t hold back his curiosity.</p><p>Mei Siren didn’t even turn his head. “There’s no need for that. We just need to stop this bird’s Saint Calamity. Although if I did that, it would draw out my Saint Calamity, this Saint Calamity… Suppress it a little. At that time, we should be able to suppress it.”</p><p>Suppress, suppress a little?</p><p>Not only Huang Quan, Jiang Buyi and Yu Lingdi were also dumbfounded.</p><p>Was it because Ancient Swordmen and Spiritual Cultivators were on different wavelengths? Why don’t we understand what you just said?</p><p>If the Saint Calamity really came, could he still suppress it?</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Nine Heavens Thunder Calamity didn’t hesitate. It split into two and streaked toward Ye Xiao and Mei Siren.</p><p>At this moment, the air was silent.</p><p>Huang Quan forgot to make a move, Jiang Buyi’s head was blank and Yu Lingdi looked up.</p><p>“Very weak…”</p><p>They all heard this soft murmur.</p><p>Mei Siren, who was in the air, narrowed his eyes. He held the folding fan in his hand and suddenly understood.</p><p>He was right.</p><p>When one used the Blood World Pearl to replace the semi-saint person, it would indeed attract the Saint Calamity.</p><p>This was because the level of the top ten Great Psionic Weapons was enough to be used as a substitute.</p><p>However, the genuine stuff would always be the real deal, and a fake would always be a fake.</p><p>The Saint Calamity that Ye Xiao had summoned was much weaker than the real Saint Calamity. It was about three times weaker.</p><p>This was why Mei Siren felt that he could make a move.</p><p>He had suppressed his own Saint Calamity a few times. It was completely different from the one before him.</p><p>Thus, he estimated that he might be able to render three slashes under such a weak Saint Calamity.</p><p>If he couldn’t resolve it later, he would have to run.</p><p>Because at that time, his Saint Calamity should have been forced out due to his actions.</p><p>The blood-colored Thunder Calamity appeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Mei Siren’s narrowed eyes suddenly opened, and he waved his folding fan upward.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The obscure sword light cut into the blood-colored Thunder Calamity, but it was like a stone that sank into a huge wave. It did not cause any ripples.</p><p>But in the next second.</p><p>A loud boom sounded behind Mei Siren. The ferocious sword image above Yama’s head that had thousands of swords that worshipped him, suddenly descended!</p><p>It glowed like a gold sword and had the incomparably huge Azure Mo Swords in its hand. They extended upwards at the same time!</p><p>“Boom boom boom boom…”</p><p>The cross-shaped sword light slashed the blood-red Thunder Calamity into four strips. They tore through the air like rotten wood and smashed through Zhen Huang Palace and the First Hall of Sins. It cut into the center of the Saint Calamity on the Abyss Island.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, the people who watched the Saint Calamity on the Abyss Island were shocked to see a flash of sword light.</p><p>After that, the Nine Heavens Saint Calamity suddenly expanded and a portion of it was shattered.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>This scene shocked all the tribulation-goers.</p><p>The person who transcended the tribulation was a Swordsman?</p><p>What kind of Swordsman could cut through lightning with a single sword and even slice off a piece of the Saint Calamity?</p><p>It was too shocking!</p><p>“Aww!”</p><p>In Zhen Huang Palace, the one who actually transcended the tribulation was blasted into the spatial fragment by the even more terrifying Saint Calamity. She struggled to escape.</p><p>Ye Xiao almost went crazy.</p><p>She was already in a very miserable state and would not be able to get through it.</p><p>Why did someone come out and provoke the Saint Calamity and caused the intensity of the Saint Calamity to rise again?</p><p>I’m the one that suffered!</p><p>“Yu Lingdi, I can’t hold on any longer. If there’s really no other way, you can only use the secondary plane door. I have to rush to the Ghost City of the Netherworld!”</p><p>“If I don’t swallow something, I’ll die under the Saint Calamity!”</p><p>After Ye Xiao ended her voice transmission, she spread its wings and flew up to face the Saint Calamity. It began to transform the location of the ‘transcend the tribulation’.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s expression turned cold.</p><p>He understood what Ye Xiao meant.</p><p>The Dark Division Chief, who had mastered the power of the God of Death, could only go to the Ghost City of the Netherworld, that was filled with soul bodies. She had to eat some souls and regain some energy. Only then would she have a chance to pass the Saint Calamity.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
