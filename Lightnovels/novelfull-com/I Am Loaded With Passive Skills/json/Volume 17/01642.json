(4)</p><p>“Accept me. You don’t have to rely on Little Xu Xiaoshou. You have the ability to take charge and make your own decisions. I am you, and you are me. You just don’t want to have my way of thinking. Actually, you can do it. Think for yourself.”</p><p>Mu Zixi fell silent.</p><p>She didn’t like to think, and she didn’t want to accept.</p><p>She had long understood that Lei Xi’er was herself, and she was Lei Xi’er. But once they merged, she would no longer be herself.</p><p>“You just don’t want to face it…” That annoying voice appeared again.” Today’s problem is small, but things in the future will be much bigger”</p><p>Mu Zixi sharply caught the key point. “So, you have a solution. You said it’s a small problem!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er fell silent. This ability to grasp the key points of a problem was very similar to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“You do have a solution!”</p><p>“I do indeed.”</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“Ye Xiao and Jiang Buyi are both your enemies. Yama is collecting the Lei Family’s Eyes, so the Five Decays of Heaven and Man are also your enemies. But if you learn to think, you will know when faced with two evils, choose the lesser one, and you can work together with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.”</p><p>“How?”</p><p>“Hand over the God Devil Eyes and wait for your death.”</p><p>“Don’t you have a more reliable way?!” Mu Zixi almost jumped up.</p><p>“Yes.” Lei Xi’er was silent for a while. Then, she said, “Take the initiative to attack and control the three of them. Then, we will rush out of First Hall of Sins through the weak spot in space. Then…” Hand over the God Devil Eyes and wait for your death.”</p><p>…</p><p>“Jiang Buyi, Rao Yaoyao has already become a Saint. Before she comes, you still have a chance to kill the Five Decays of Heaven and Man with me. ”</p><p>Ye Xiao was being very concise with her words.</p><p>She did not understand why Jiang Buyi was hesitating. Why did he want to retreat under the gaze of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man?</p><p>If he could retreat, could the North Region’s Puxuan Jiang Clan retreat?</p><p>If he, Jiang Buyi, did not help the Holy Divine Palace today, he would be charged with colluding with the Yama in the future.</p><p>The Puxuan Jiang Clan of the North Region would definitely die!</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man also did not allow Jiang Buyi to leave.</p><p>“Why are you here?” the Five Declines of Heaven and Man asked.</p><p>Jiang Buyi glanced at Ye Xiao. His expression was extremely solemn and complicated.” I’m only here to complete a mission…”</p><p>What kind of damned mission was this!</p><p>Was it really necessary for 50 Void Crystals? For this, he must fight against the Body of Decay again!</p><p>“What mission?” Five Decays of Heaven and Man was the most unhurried one in the Arena.</p><p>“Bring her back to the Zhen Huang Palace and exchange her for the Exemption order.” Jiang Buyi hesitated but still opened his mouth and pointed at Ye Xiao.</p><p>“You found the Zhen Huang Palace?” Five Decays of Heaven and Man was surprised, then he laughed, “How many void crystals do you need?”</p><p>Ye Xiao’s heart skipped a beat. She felt that things were not going well.</p><p>“Fifty…”</p><p>Just as Jiang Buyi spoke, with a swish, a spatial ring flew over in an elegant arc in the air.</p><p>“I’ll give you 60 void crystals. Help me capture the Ye Xiao. The rest can be considered a gift.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi blushed immediately.</p><p>He felt humiliated!</p><p>However, fifty void crystals were life-saving items when the countdown was about to run out. He had no choice but to take them!</p><p>If he missed this opportunity again, he did not know how long he would have to wait.</p><p>Capture the Void Attendants and kill him? It was easy to say, but he, Jiang Buyi, could not make a move now!</p><p>Jiang Buyi moved with a swish of his sleeves.</p><p>No matter how shameful it was, a man would bow down for five buckets of rice, and a Saint would bow down for fifty void crystals. Jiang Buyi wanted to take the spatial ring.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>“Aww-”</p><p>Accompanied by an ear-piercing owl cry, in the darkness, Ye Xiao made a powerful move and took the spatial ring first.</p><p>She couldn’t let Jiang Buyi succeed. If she were to face the Five Decays of Heaven and Man alone, there was a high chance that she wouldn’t be able to last until Rao Yaoyao’s support.</p><p>At the same time, there was a commotion behind the three of them.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was shocked.</p><p>It was not because of Ye Xiao’s attack, but because of the pale-faced Taboo puppet behind him. Power of the World and Holy Power suddenly surged out of its body and attacked.</p><p>This was even scarier than the Ye Xiao!</p><p>Jiang Buyi immediately turned around to guard against the Taboo Puppets. He did not even want his spatial ring.</p><p>Ye Xiao was also shocked by this little girl.</p><p>She did know Mu Zixi, but in such a situation, what could a little girl do?</p><p>Who would have thought that this little girl possessed Saint Energy?</p><p>Silently, two peak Higher Void and a Demi-Saint noticed the flower that had bloomed on the ground at some point in time. Black and White Reborn Lily!</p><p>“This…” Ye Xiao’s pupils trembled. She recognized this Reborn Lily!</p><p>However, before she could think about it, the spatial ring in her hand suddenly exploded with a bang.</p><p>A huge Lord of Calamity, completely constructed from the air of decay, emerged from the sky.</p><p>While Ye Xiao was still in shock, the behemoth turned into pure air of decay and violently poured into her mouth and nose.</p><p>“Ughhhhh-”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s heart was trembling when he heard that.</p><p>At this moment, his two eyes were completely insufficient.</p><p>The scene he saw in his holy sense was the Five Decays of Heaven and Man using the spatial ring to trick Ye Xiao.</p><p>When he turned his head, what he saw was the Taboo puppet that had followed him all the way. Its eyes had transformed into the legendary…God Devil Eye!</p><p>Moreover, she spoke in human language.</p><p>“Mo Ji!”</p><p>Mu Zixi was the first to control Jiang Buyi, who was a threat to her. Seeing that Ye Xiao was hit at the same time, she was delighted and quickly turned to the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>As long as she could control this person, she would be able to escape from the First Hall of Sins through the weak spot in space.</p><p>“Godhood…”</p><p>However, before she could say anything, she saw the orange-masked man suddenly turn his head.</p><p>Under the mask, the three grey flowers in his right eye spun at high speed and finally merged into his pupil.</p><p>The speed at which the Five Decays of Heaven and Man appeared was even faster than Mu Zixi’s God Devil Eye!</p><p>“Three Loathsome Eyes, Mind-Changing Aperture…”</p><p>At this moment, Mu Zixi’s thoughts were as slow as the puppet.</p><p>In the dark First Hall of Sins, the Five Decay of Heaven and Man raised his hands high.</p><p>At this moment, a smile appeared in his left eye.</p><p>At this moment, the dark night and the gray fog became eternal in the eyes of the other three people present!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
