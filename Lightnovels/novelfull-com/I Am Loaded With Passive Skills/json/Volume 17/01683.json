(5)</p><p>“My ‘sword cognition’ was born from this.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held his cup and sat there lifelessly, his gaze empty, unable to speak for a long time.</p><p>The geniuses of this world…</p><p>How should he put it?</p><p>They were all f*cking ridiculous!</p><p>Bazhun’an being extraordinary was one thing, but among those who were contemporaries with him, there indeed wasn’t a single normal person!</p><p>The birth of the first generation of Penetrating Divine Senses, the “God Punishment Tribulation”, only took such a short time of enlightenment?</p><p>In less than the time it took for an incense stick to burn…</p><p>Later generations wanted to study and understand this power.</p><p>They had put in thousands of times more effort and spent decades, but in the end, they chose to give up!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had heard of it.</p><p>Decades ago, there was still a “Sense Division” in the Holy Divine Palace, which focused on “Penetrating Divine Senses.”</p><p>In the end, research showed that this thing could only be cultivated by a monster and could not be popularized.</p><p>Thus, the entire “Sense Division” announced its disbandment.</p><p>The seven divisions had become the six divisions of today.</p><p>“Master Bazhun’an…”</p><p>“Hey, don’t!”</p><p>Kong Yuhen’s politeness caused Bazhun’an to feel extremely uncomfortable, and his face contorted.</p><p>He looked back and saw this person raising his cup respectfully. And Bazhun’an also raised his cup.</p><p>“Anyway, thank you for telling me so much. I think I have a direction now on who to look for next.”</p><p>Kong Yuhen lightly clinked his cup and downed it in one gulp.</p><p>Bazhun’an put down his cup and wiped the corners of his mouth, but he could not help but laugh. “I’m not telling you everything.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou touched his cup and could not come back to his senses.</p><p>“Why? Are you scared silly?” The corners of Bazhun’an’s lips curled up, and their tone was filled with mockery.</p><p>“That’s not it. It’s just that…” Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t describe what he was feeling right now. He could only say, “It’s a mixture of emotions, like a dream.”</p><p>“I didn’t say so much to discourage you.”</p><p>“What then?”</p><p>“You’re about to break through to the Sovereign Stage, aren’t you?”</p><p>“Yes, the main reason why I came this time is… Uh, it’s not the main thing. It’s secondary. I need you to protect me… Hmm, this doesn’t seem important. More importantly, I want to ask you if you have any experience in breaking through to the Sovereign Dao Realm…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>The voice of Bazhun’an suddenly became heavy and interrupted Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>His gaze became extremely sharp, no longer murky. It was like a sword that had been hidden for decades and had suddenly been unsheathed.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou met his gaze, he felt a sharp pain in his mind and his senses were in a daze, as if he had been stabbed by a sword.</p><p>He thought it was an illusion…</p><p>However, the Information Bar suddenly jumped.</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Attacked?</p><p>Killing with his eyes?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. He tilted his head and subconsciously wanted to look away, not daring to look at her.</p><p>But he suddenly stopped and stared.</p><p>His face felt itchy as if some liquid was flowing down.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waited for a while and licked it. It tasted fishy.</p><p>He finally saw through his “Perception” that his eyes had been pierced until they were bleeding, just because he was looking at Bazhun’an!</p><p>“You, what do you want to do?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at him for a while before he spoke hesitantly.</p><p>He suddenly realized that Bazhun’an was actually handsome. At least, this guy had obviously tidied himself up in the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion and was no longer sloppy.</p><p>After he cleaned himself up, his face was firm and his lines were tough. His entire face gave off an oppressive and aggressive feeling.</p><p>“Do you have something important to tell me?” Xu Xiaoshou touched his face and suddenly felt that this exchange of gazes was a bad start.</p><p>Bazhun’an finally couldn’t hold it in any longer. The corners of their mouths twitched as they retracted their sharp gazes and sighed.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, haven’t you noticed that you’ve become cautious since some time ago?”</p><p>This sound was like a great bell, thought-provoking.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind went blank, and he forgot to do anything.</p><p>“Perhaps it’s the Dongtianwang City, perhaps it’s the Abyss Island, or perhaps the enemies you’re facing are getting stronger and stronger.”</p><p>“But these are not reasons for you to lose your spirit.”</p><p>Bazhun’an narrowed his eyes and said solemnly, “Think about it, before the Dongtianwang City, I allowed you to cause trouble and set you free because you were extremely capable and could do things that ordinary people could not.”</p><p>“But along the way, you seem to be taking yourself too lightly. You even started to equate yourself with some trash.”</p><p>“Higher void? Demi-saint?”</p><p>Bazhun’an snorted, his eyes filled with contempt as if he was looking at trash.</p><p>“Most of the people you meet today have only cultivated for a few decades or a hundred years more than you.”</p><p>“Do you want to take the same path as them from their point of view and use their trash thinking to influence your own will?”</p><p>“Take the dross and discard the essence?”</p><p>Bazhun’an leaned forward, his eyes filled with mockery as he looked over, “Think about what you accomplished on Abyss Island. Almost nothing!”</p><p>“You can’t kill everyone, but you run away when you encounter danger… When I was your age, I was arrogant and had no one behind me, but I still charged forward.”</p><p>“You’ve become timid, Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>Bazhun’an stopped mocking him, his expression calmed down, and his speech slowed down.</p><p>“This is not a good transformation.”</p><p>“But it’s not your fault. In the end, it’s because your horizons are limited. That’s why I’m telling you so much today.”</p><p>Pausing for a moment, he said heavily, “Xu Xiaoshou, the person you want to surpass isn’t Rao Yaoyao, nor is it Jiang Buyi, nor is it Mei Siren or Huang Quan.”</p><p>“It’s about Kui Leihan and Shenyi, even if you haven’t met them yet.”</p><p>“If there’s still no basis for comparison, then… Me!”</p><p>Bazhun’an stood up.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
