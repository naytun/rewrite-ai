Idiot!”</p><p>“You’re a fool who only knows how to absorb the Life force. How could I have such a stupid junior sister like you?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s second true body still maintained the Vanishing Technique. He ranted angrily at the little girl who was already drunk beyond recognition in midair.</p><p>The second true body had arrived at the scene some time ago. He had arrived shortly after the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>As soon as he entered the arena, he saw the following scenes: how Ye Xiao made her move; how the Five Decays of Heaven and Man tossed rings to trick people; how his little junior sister made such a resourceful move, and Jiang Buyi being controlled on the spot.</p><p>At that time, little junior sister hadn’t made her move yet. The second true body had already wanted to come out and rescue her-at the cost of his life!</p><p>The Heavens had taken pity on him. Xu Xiaoshou, that d*mned person, had summoned his second true body so casually. He really didn’t want to give him any treasures!</p><p>The second true body only had a Buddha Slaying Blade and an Empty Hell Magic Staff before he followed the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>This mission was supposed to be extremely easy.</p><p>He trailed far behind the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and did nothing but watch the show.</p><p>Who would have thought that his original body, Xu Xiaoshou, had not been able to make it to the battlefield after he came out of Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>When he viewed the battle scene through the perspective of the second true body and saw that his junior junior sister was there, he changed the mission.</p><p>“Save them!”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter if you die. I’ll just create another one, but little junior sister must be saved!”</p><p>The second true body’s face turned green on the spot.</p><p>He had inherited all the abilities of the main body, but he had not inherited any of the treasures.</p><p>Once he deactivated the Vanishing Technique and went to save his junior sister, he wouldn’t be able to hide in the Yuan Mansion and he would be exposed. Furthermore, the Vanishing Technique Spell couldn’t bring anyone away, and only he would be able to escape through the ‘take the easy way out’.</p><p>He had a Passive Fist, but he didn’t have the system in his mind, so he didn’t have any charge point. All he had left was a soft punch.</p><p>He had the Disillusionment Finger, but similarly, he did not have any charge point. He could not accumulate them yet. At most, he only had one Spirit Awakening left that could passively trigger the immunity control.</p><p>How could he save this person?</p><p>“Don’t forget that you’re Xu Xiaoshou. Think of a way to solve it yourself!”</p><p>When the second true body heard this, he was so angry that he wanted to kill someone with his sword-he wanted to rush into the battlefield and die.</p><p>However, little junior sister gave him hope.</p><p>This girl was quick-witted. She knew that everyone coveted the God Devil Eyes and did not dare to damage it, so she took the initiative to attack. Well, she was not that quick-witted. It was likely that Lei Xi’er had woken up.</p><p>But no matter what, Mu Zixi’s operation was a success.</p><p>Her apathetic state deceived everyone, including Xu Xiaoshou. She also tricked the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and dared to absorb the Life force of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>Brave and resourceful, she dared to charge forward and was iron-blooded, swift and decisive!</p><p>Little junior sister, you’ve finally grown up!</p><p>It had to be said that up until now, this plan had been 95% successful. Xu Xiaoshou had not expected that it would be so smooth.</p><p>He could even predict that Mu… No, Lei Xi’er’s next plan would be to take advantage of the stalemate between the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and Ye Xiao to absorb its Life force. Then at the same time, to gather energy while she summoned the ancient wood to shatter the space.</p><p>This place was the weakest spot in the First Hall of Sins. One could see through the space node.</p><p>As long as the space exploded, they would be able to enter the spatial fragment.</p><p>If she was fast and accurate, there was a high chance that when she left the spatial fragment, little junior sister would be able to leave the First Hall of and make her way to the giant kingdom in the Abyss Island.</p><p>From then on, the space was there for her to show her talent.</p><p>Mu Zixi probably was not aware of this and was still worried about her escape route.</p><p>However, the second true body understood it very well through the cooperation between the main body and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man had a special obsession with Ye Xiao.</p><p>Although he did not know why, if he had to choose between Ye Xiao and the God Devil Eyes, there was a high chance that he would want both!</p><p>The second true body even calculated the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s next move: After he took down Ye Xiao, he would chase after the God Devil Eyes. One was disabled and the other was weak, so both were readily available.</p><p>However, it would require some effort to take down Ye Xiao.</p><p>At that time, his second true body would turn into Huang Quan and appear, and would casually delay them for a while.</p><p>Even if he was recognized and had to pay with his life, he would still restrain the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. This way, little junior sister would definitely be able to escape.</p><p>In the end…</p><p>At the critical moment, little junior sister lost the plot!</p><p>She absorbed the Life force and became drunk…</p><p>Drunk?</p><p>Ah! How could there be such a fool in this world?</p><p>The enemy was right in front of them, and their lives were at stake… and you… you got drunk?</p><p>You can get drunk when you drink, but when you can absorb Life force… You become addicted until you talk in your sleep, until you forget that your original intention was to escape.</p><p>What on earth was this?</p><p>The second true body had finally found a way to survive in this chaotic chess game with its wisdom.</p><p>Under the merciless casting and bombardment of the enemy’s ‘cannon horses and chariots,’ he served this honorable junior sister who was in the position of ‘marshal’, with all his heart as an ‘official’.</p><p>However, at the end of the game, the second true body didn’t even care about his life. He wanted to block the blade for the commander and rise up.</p><p>Suddenly, the ‘commander’ drew his sword and shouted.</p><p>“General!”</p><p>Why did Your Majesty rebel?</p><p>The second true body was stunned instantly.</p><p>He used his Holy Power and risked being exposed to send a telepathic communication to his junior sister. He wanted to arouse this strange little drunkard.</p><p>The Holy Power was indeed useful. The Five Decays of Heaven and Man should not be able to intercept his telepathic communication.</p><p>However, the call failed…</p><p>How could a drunkard be woken up?</p><p>The second true body was at a loss and immediately transmitted his thoughts to the main body, “Do you like Mu Zixi or Lei Xi’er? I like Lei Xi’er anyway…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
