His gaze was fixed firmly on the unconscious Ye Xiao, who floated in the void.</p><p>He clenched his fists.</p><p>“The first one…”</p><p>“Don’t worry, you won’t be the last one!”</p><p>After a cold sizzle, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man turned around and was about to leave the scene of transcending the tribulation.</p><p>As a peak higher void expert, he would be courting death if he were to be at the center of transcending the tribulation.</p><p>He might even summon his saint calamity if he was not careful.</p><p>However, when he turned around…</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man, which had been completely focused on Ye Xiao and his plan, finally discovered it.</p><p>Behind him was a little puppet with widened eyes and a face full of horror. It was holding its fingers up in a posture as if it wanted to launch a sneak attack, but it did not dare to move.</p><p>He was puzzled.</p><p>At this moment, the air was silent.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man looked at Mu Zixi.</p><p>Mu Zixi widened her eyes and stared back at him.</p><p>The two of them stared at each other and stopped thinking for a moment.</p><p>“Yes…”</p><p>“What do you want to do?” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s gaze fell on the little finger the little puppet had raised.</p><p>“Help!”</p><p>Mu Zixi ran away as fast as she could, ignoring Xu Xiaoshou’s orders.</p><p>She had listened to all the plans behind the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. However, after she had listened to the entire plan, she was still confused as to what did they want to do!</p><p>However!</p><p>This didn’t stop Mu Zixi from seeing that Five Decays of Heaven and Man was a lunatic, a perverted fact!</p><p>Instigating people to forcefully undergo the saint calamity and even asking others to possess themselves and be resurrected…</p><p>If this wasn’t a pervert, then what was it?</p><p>“Wahhh!”</p><p>Mu Zixi stepped on Holy Power and broke through the space, heading towards the weak spot.</p><p>She clapped her hands, and countless ancient trees rose into the sky. They smashed toward the direction of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and exploded.</p><p>She squeaked.</p><p>Other people couldn’t understand, only Xu Xiaoshou could.</p><p>These three “wah” sounds corresponded to the three words “Xu Xiaoshou”.</p><p>“Old man!”</p><p>It was unknown whether the second true body was cursing the main body or cursing the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. With a shake of his body, he transformed into a Gold-robe masked man and removed the Vanishing Technique</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>The ancient trees didn’t even get close to the Five Decays of Heaven and Man before they turned into decayed mist and disappeared.</p><p>Just as the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was about to capture him, their chief monk walked out from the horizon.</p><p>“Huang Quan… Lord Huang Quan?” He was stunned.</p><p>“Yes.” The second true body didn’t say much. He nodded slightly and turned his gaze toward the direction where Mu Zixi had escaped. “Hand her over to me,” he said, and then he intended to leave.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man tilted his head. “Didn’t we agree to act separately? Shouldn’t Lord Huang Quan be on his way to kill Demi-Saint Jiang?”</p><p>With a crack, the second true body was petrified on the spot.</p><p>What was that?</p><p>What did you say?</p><p>Was Huang Quan on his way to kill Jiang Buyi?</p><p>For the first time, Xu Xiaoshou felt that both of his brains were not enough. Not only was his second true body stunned, but his main body also stopped midway.</p><p>Ye Xiao’s saint calamity had not yet fallen, but it was as if a burst of lightning had struck her brain, shooting out countless electric forks.</p><p>“The Huang Quan and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man are acting separately?”</p><p>“Do they have a secret method of communication between them?”</p><p>“Therefore, Jiang Buyi was deliberately sent away by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. I have never seen Huang Quan since he entered the Abyss Island…”</p><p>“The Yama and the Water Ghost have also cooperated. Under the deep sea, the Water Ghost had already planned to kill Saint Jiang Buyi. Is he involved in this?”</p><p>As his thoughts flashed across his mind and finally converged into one last thought, he realized the truth.</p><p>“D*mn it, my identity is going to be exposed!”</p><p>Why did he always lose his identity so quickly in front of Five Decays of Heaven and Man?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not have time to think about this question. He saw that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, who had tilted his head just now, had already turned his face.</p><p>He had a hint of amusement in his eyes.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>He cursed inwardly, “F*ck you, I’m your boss, Huang Quan, not Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>The second true body saw the situation with a glance and knew that his worthless life was about to be lost.</p><p>He was a little puzzled.</p><p>Although Mu Zixi was in danger and someone came to rescue her, and this person was able to transform into Huang Quan. But Xu Xiaoshou had never shown his abilities, and had never previously had any interactions with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man…</p><p>How could he deduce so accurately and directly say the words “Xu Xiaoshou”?</p><p>Did he know Xu Xiaoshou deeply?</p><p>Was it only relying on intelligence?</p><p>Was it only based on Yama’s understanding and fondness for Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>“What are you talking about?” The second true body braced himself and turned to look coldly at the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. He still looked like Huang Quan.</p><p>At this moment, even the real Xu Xiaoshou felt a little unbearable in his heart.</p><p>It was too difficult for the second true body. After being recognized, he still had to pretend to say, “You’re wrong, listen to me.”</p><p>If his main body was present.</p><p>At this moment, Vanishing Technique, take the easy way out, and the Yuan Mansion world were all prepared.</p><p>However, his second true body didn’t have a Yuan Mansion world.</p><p>His life was indeed bitter. Without this step, there was nothing he could do.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I will treat you well in your next life…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou swore as he watched the Five Decays of Heaven and Man grimace at the second true body in pain. Then, his body emitted a surging aura of decay as he pounced forward!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
