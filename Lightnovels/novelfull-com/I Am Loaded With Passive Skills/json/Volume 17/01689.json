(4)</h1><p>1689 Crazy Half-Saint, Three Tribulation Eyes, Buried Together! (4)</p><p>How could these two be at the higher void level?</p><p>These were two demons!</p><p>If he, Yu Lingdi, was the strongest among the younger generation of the current era…</p><p>Then, wouldn’t these two be the most talented in their era?</p><p>They were already old.</p><p>However, would the talent of an old genius fade as well?</p><p>No!</p><p>Their combat strength would only become more terrifying as time passed! They were even more shrewd when it came to schemes!</p><p>From the inside to the bottom, from the body to the mind, from strength to strategy…</p><p>He was completely crushed!</p><p>“Pa, pa, pa…”</p><p>Huang Quan’s applause rang out. His tone was filled with reverence and admiration.</p><p>“Master Siren’s Fantasy Sword Technique is truly flawless. Even I could not see any flaws. It’s too strong; a role model for our generation.”</p><p>“Stop flattering me.”</p><p>Mei Siren had attacked a junior. When he thought about it, his face turned red with embarrassment.</p><p>“My Fantasy Sword Technique is one of the worst sword arts. It can only be used to bully people. If we had a battle and used this move, it is tantamount to suicide.”</p><p>“Besides, if you didn’t see the flaw in my Fantasy Sword Technique, why did you stop?”</p><p>The half-kneeling Yu Lingdi trembled slightly and laughed silently.</p><p>The worst swordsmanship…</p><p>Heh.</p><p>Huang Quan was very sensible and did not pursue the topic. He changed the subject and said.</p><p>“How could Master Siren attack the people of the Holy Divine Palace? You’re going to be blacklisted.”</p><p>“The Holy Divine Palace is insane. If you didn’t join the fray previously, you would naturally be fine.”</p><p>“If I attack now, I’m afraid I won’t be able to escape in the future.”</p><p>“Therefore, rather than being surrounded and killed by the Holy Divine Palace, it is better for Master Siren to choose to join Yama at this time. I’ll take the second seat and you’ll be the Chief. What do you think?”</p><p>Mei Siren glanced at him.</p><p>When he thought that this was the real reason why Yama had asked him to help, he couldn’t help but laugh. Everything in his hand changed into a fan.</p><p>Silently, Mei Siren opened the fan and gently waved it.</p><p>Huang Quan looked up.</p><p>On the brand new paper fan, there were a few big words written in thick ink:</p><p>“Are you stupid?”</p><p>Huang Quan was startled and laughed dryly.</p><p>Soon, he restrained all his emotions and praised him. “Master Siren’s literary talent is outstanding. His words are profound as an ancient saying…”</p><p>“You are better at flattery than my disciple.” Mei Siren interrupted him and looked outside Zhen Huang Palace quietly. He seemed to be waiting for the prey to arrive.</p><p>Huang Quan wanted to say something, but Mei Siren spoke first.</p><p>“Don’t think too much about it.”</p><p>“After this matter is done, I will leave and will not join any of you.”</p><p>“The Holy Divine Palace will understand. I only owe you a favor and will not go against them to the end.”</p><p>“After all, if they really attack me, it would be equivalent to them making an enemy for themselves.”</p><p>“Sacred Mountain Guizhe wouldn’t want another Sword Deity to be killed, even if he was alone.”</p><p>Huang Quan choked.</p><p>What kind of boldness was this?</p><p>Even if he was alone, he was not afraid of any faction the world!</p><p>Of course, Huang Quan and everyone else could understand why Mei Siren was so confident.</p><p>If he really forced this monster into a corner…</p><p>He was a Saint and had fought his way up to the Saint mountain.</p><p>At that time, it would not be something that one or two Demi-Saints could prevent.</p><p>He estimated that… blood would flow like a river!</p><p>“Your elegance is the envy of others.”</p><p>Huang Quan shook his head and sighed. “Sometimes, I also wish to be free from all ties. That way, I have nothing to hold me back and I can come and go as I please. Unfortunately… I had hopes. I had hopes that there will be opportunities for cooperation in the future.”</p><p>“I hope not.” Mei Siren was very blunt. He would say whatever came to his mind to someone like Huang Quan.</p><p>Of course, he could also discern the faint threat in Huang Quan’s words. He glanced at him and said.</p><p>“If you want to be alone, you can dismiss Yama.”</p><p>“However, what do you want to use to start the next cooperation in your current ‘lone’ state? I advise you to give up on this idea as soon as possible.”</p><p>Mei Siren waved his paper fan and looked into the distance.</p><p>“The Lei Family’s Eyes are not easy to collect, so don’t deceive yourself.”</p><p>The smile in Huang Quan’s eyes froze. All the expressions under the mask were restrained and became somber. At the same time, he did not say anything.</p><p>He had hinted that anyone could use Xu Xiaoshou as a threat against Mei Siren; that was his meaning.</p><p>Mei Siren made it clear; he would beat him up!</p><p>He was indeed not alone.</p><p>However, if you really want to attack my people and leave me to be all alone, you can try.</p><p>“Old man, you really would not budge!”</p><p>“Hmph!” Huang Quan shouted coldly in his heart as he looked out of Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s Demi-Saint Incarnation was really slow to arrive.</p><p>Huang Quan could not help but cast his gaze at Yu Lingdi, who was suppressed by ten thousand swords and could not move.</p><p>He thought for a moment and flicked his fingers.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s legs were immediately cut off by the misplaced space, and blood flowed.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Screams rang out.</p><p>Yu Lingdi fell to the ground with a bang and his eyes were filled with shock and confusion.</p><p>I didn’t resist either…</p><p>Mei Siren frowned and glanced at Huang Quan, but didn’t say anything.</p><p>He waited.</p><p>He only waited for a short time.</p><p>At a certain moment, the sound of wind breaking could be heard outside Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>Floating clouds and mist seeped in from the great array outside the palace and filled the entire Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>“He’s here!”</p><p>The expression in Huang Quan’s eyes became extremely serious.</p><p>This time, it was a true bloody chapter, because the Demi-Saint had been forced to a corner.</p><p>“I will look after him.”</p><p>Mei Siren chose the more difficult job : to keep watch over Yu Lingdi.</p><p>It was obvious that Jiang Buyi was here to pick a fight with someone. His choice meant that he would be the first to face this Demi-Saint.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
