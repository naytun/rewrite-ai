(3)</p><p>“Jiang Buyi!”</p><p>With a buzz, the dark clouds in the void converged, as if the Saint punishment was about to descend.</p><p>However, in the next aura, the Heaven and Earth phenomenon suddenly dissipated, as if it had seen something that should not be seen.</p><p>Number Two looked away from the dark clouds and gazed toward the north. He nodded and said, “I know where Jiang Buyi is. Leave this matter to me. You go to Zhen Huang Palace first.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao suddenly had an overall feeling of discomfort.</p><p>This feeling she had, of her life being arranged by someone from top to bottom and inside out, made her very unhappy.</p><p>The joy she felt after she became a Saint felt like she had accidentally swallowed a fly during the celebration. It was extremely disgusting.</p><p>Number Two pondered for a moment and suddenly said, “I’m very sorry. My words just now had been too harsh… However, Hallmaster Dao asked me to relay the message verbatim. He asked me to say all of the above because it was his instructions… He also said he wanted to beat you up.”</p><p>After Rao Yaoyao fell into a trance, the veins on her forehead throbbed violently.</p><p>I wondered why it was so heart-wrenching. So it was Dao Qiongcang’s words and Number Two was just a messenger!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao rubbed the spatial ring that contained the Void Crystal and still found it hard to swallow her anger. She gritted her teeth so hard that they almost shattered. She suppressed her anger and struggled to speak.</p><p>“Help me thank him! That includes the gifts!”</p><p>Number Two suddenly shrunk and became the same height as Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>He faced Rao Yaoyao, and the corners of his lips stretched upward as he revealed a stiff smile. He said calmly, “You’re welcome.”</p><p>At that moment, Rao Yaoyao felt her anger soar to the Heavens. She wished she could slash this damned Divine Puppet to pieces!</p><p>“Did he ask you to say that?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Then why are you laughing?! ”</p><p>“I’m sorry to have made you unhappy, but Hallmaster Dao asked me to shrink and speak with a smile… Oh, right, ‘I’m sorry to have made you unhappy’ was also what he told me to say.”</p><p>First Hall of Sins was a weak space.</p><p>Mu Zixi looked ahead, her face pale. She had already learned about the identities and relationships of these three people through their conversation.</p><p>Jiang Buyi, the Dark Divison Chief, Ye Xiao, and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man!</p><p>Jiang and Ye were equal partners, their relationship was the kind between the Demi-Saint faction and the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>Between Ye and the Five Decays, there was a life and death relationship. Ye Xiao had been driven like a duck by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man to this place.</p><p>Five Decays and Jiang seemed to be friends. Anyway, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man did not allow Jiang Buyi to stand on Ye Xiao’s side. Ye Xiao wanted Jiang Buyi to stand on her side. Jiang Buyi himself did not want to stand on either side. He wanted to stay out of it, but it seemed to be very difficult to do so.</p><p>“Receiving treasures, wuwuwu…”</p><p>Mu Zixi was about to cry. She only missed Xu Xiaoshou when she was alone.</p><p>In the past, she didn’t even need to think about this kind of complicated relationship that was twisted like a ball of twine. She would just do whatever Xu Xiaoshou said.</p><p>In any case, she and Xu Xiaoshou would be the ones who would benefit the most in the end. This was Xu Xiaoshou’s ability!</p><p>However, Mu Zixi had no choice but to rely on herself to figure out this relationship because it could be a threat to her life.</p><p>Mu Zixi felt like her brain was about to turn into mush.</p><p>But fortunately, she had become smarter. She was just a little step away and she could still figure out everything.</p><p>“Don’t think about it.” Suddenly, a charming female voice sounded in her mind.</p><p>“You’re awake?” Mu Zixi was overjoyed. “Quick, help me sort this out. I can’t take it anymore. Why did you only come out now? You clearly woke up long ago!”</p><p>“Alright, I’ll help you sort it out.” The big sister’s voice was very doting, as if she was not bothered about how Mu Zixi had treated her in the past.</p><p>“The Five Decays of Heaven and Man knows you. He should have recognized your identity, but he did not pay too much attention to you just now. He doesn’t care about you.”</p><p>“Ye Xiao also recognized you. She had seen you before… She wants to kill you, but she doesn’t understand why you’re with Jiang Buyi now. She’s afraid that Jiang Buyi will completely change sides and join the Five Decays Of Heaven and Man.”</p><p>“As for Jiang Buyi, don’t worry. He doesn’t know you, but he should know who you are very soon.”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s eyes were filled with stars, and her small head was completely in a mess. “What, what do you mean?”</p><p>“I said, they recognized you.”</p><p>“Impossible, I didn’t use Mu Zixi’s face. They can’t have recognized me!” Mu Zixi was anxious.</p><p>“But you used Mu Zixi’s face. They might not know you at first and only found you familiar because everyone only ever saw you on paper and on the jade scroll… However, they will soon remember that Sang Qiye, the second-in-command Saint servant, took in a disciple named Mu Zixi during an apprenticeship ceremony.”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s vision turned black and she almost fell.</p><p>She had never thought that the reason her identity could be exposed was because of Elder Sang!</p><p>How was it that the old man was locked up in the Holy Divine Palace and could still trick me? No wonder Xu Xiaoshou did not like him…</p><p>“What should I do?”</p><p>“Hand over the God Devil Eyes and wait for your death.”</p><p>“I don’t want to die, sob… Xu Xiaoshou must know where I am. He will come and save me!”</p><p>“He was here last time too. You died the last time too.”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>“I can shut up, but you have to understand that Xu Xiaoshou can save you once, but he can’t save you indefinitely. You’ve always resisted me. One day, we will die together.”</p><p>“Then what should I do…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
