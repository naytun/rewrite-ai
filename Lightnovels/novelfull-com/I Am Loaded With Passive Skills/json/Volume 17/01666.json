(3)</p><p>He didn’t dare to mess around or offend them!</p><p>You little Yu Lingdi, when I was in the Spiritual Cultivation World, you were still in your infancy and crying for food!</p><p>How dare you threaten me, a Saint?</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s arm trembled slightly and he only exerted some force.</p><p>“Forget it.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s fingertips pinched together.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>“I will cooperate! Cooperate!”</p><p>“I agree! I agree to whatever you say! I will cooperate!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi panicked. The beast in his heart suddenly died.</p><p>Compared to being temporarily conscripted by the Holy Divine Palace, being banished to the Inner Island of the Abyss Island was a real nightmare.</p><p>That d*mned place was not fit for humans.</p><p>If you were a Ghost Beast, it would be fine. At least you would have some strange survival skills.</p><p>If you were an ancient ferocious beast, you would be able to withstand it, no matter how weak your physical body was.</p><p>However, if an Eight Classics Spiritual Cultivator were to enter, the Spell Forbidden Barrier would be too powerful. It was no child’s play!</p><p>“Hand it over.”</p><p>“Swear.”</p><p>“I swear on the Great Path…”</p><p>“The Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s face became sullen. Apparently, he was provoked again. He waved his sleeve. “I only brought half of the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree with me this time. I used it in the battle with Mei Siren.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi sneered and his eyes were filled with ridicule. Do you think I believe you? Also Mei Siren…</p><p>Jiang Buyi exhaled heavily and took out a black-red scroll from his bosom helplessly. “Speak!”</p><p>Only then did Yu Lingdi become serious and read the Imperial Decree in a loud voice. “Today, I’m giving you an exemption order. In return, Demi-Saint Saint Jiang Buyi needs to accept a temporary conscription. When you are on the Abyss Island, you must obey Rao’s orders unconditionally…”</p><p>The half-dead Ye Xiao beside him suddenly coughed a few times and spat out a few mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>Yu Lingdi frowned and looked away. He lightly exhaled and corrected what he said.</p><p>“Listen to my orders and do not accept anyone else’s orders. This order is an oath, and those who violate it will be executed!”</p><p>Ye Xiao closed her eyes and breathed slowly.</p><p>The veins on Jiang Buyi’s forehead throbbed violently when he heard that.</p><p>He was a Demi-Saint!</p><p>All because of the exemption order, he didn’t even care about his integrity and directly snatched 50 Void Crystals.</p><p>In the end, when he arrived at the Zhen Huang Palace, he realized that this pile of trash was useless.</p><p>Forget about that. The key was that in order to survive, he still had to listen to the orders of a junior from the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>What was this?</p><p>A Demi-Saint had to obey the orders of a Cutting Path?</p><p>Wouldn’t he be a laughing stock if this got out?</p><p>“Why? Is there a problem?” Yu Lingdi waited for a long while, but Jiang Buyi did not move.</p><p>“You don’t believe in Demi-Saint Rao?” Jiang Buyi snorted coldly. He already knew that Rao Yaoyao had been conferred the title of Saint and not Mei Siren.</p><p>“There’s no need to sow discord. She has other missions.” Yu Lingdi was unmoved.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was silent.</p><p>After a long time, he finally stirred. He spread out the black and red scroll in his hand and gently threw it up.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>A dazzling light instantly enveloped the entire Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao and Yu Lingdi opened their eyes and looked up. They felt that the sky had been replaced by the black-red scroll. It was the only thing left in the world.</p><p>There was a huge ancient word engraved on the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree that emitted a mysterious power.</p><p>“Permit!”</p><p>The ethereal Saint Language sounded in his ears.</p><p>The Demi- Saint’s Mysterious Decree turned into two streams of light after the light erupted. Half of it fell on Yu Lingdi’s head and the other half fell into Jiang Buyi’s body.</p><p>Oath!</p><p>Only when the phenomenon ended did the light return to Yu Lingdi’s blood-red eyes.</p><p>Finally…</p><p>Jiang Buyi, this sh*t-stirring stick, who had messed up so many parties, had finally returned to his hands at this moment, and was being used by him.</p><p>This time, even if he didn’t order Jiang Buyi about, he would only need to pay attention to the enemy. He didn’t need to worry about Demi-Saint Jiang who kept moving about and he did not know what his purpose was.</p><p>“Give me a hand.” Yu Lingdi gave the first order.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s expression was gloomy as he stretched out his hand and helped Yu Lingdi up. At the same time, he also made time to retrieve the exemption token.</p><p>Yu Lingdi suddenly turned his head and his burning gaze scared Jiang Buyi so much that his hand froze and he did not dare to move forward.</p><p>However, the oath of the Great Path had been made under the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree. Jiang Buyi was not afraid of Yu Lingdi’s threat.</p><p>He knew his value.</p><p>As a Demi-Saint with unparalleled combat strength, no matter which side he chose to join.</p><p>No matter how much hatred there was, as long as one was sensible, they would choose to give face and accept a lower Demi-Saint.</p><p>Of course, Yu Lingdi would not kill the hostage. He was a sensible person and only reminded him.</p><p>“I’m not lying to you. This is the last exemption order. After you accept it, listen to my orders and don’t make any random moves.”</p><p>“You must know that this thing can cancel your ‘countdown to exile’ once. However, if you do anything stupid and restart the countdown again, even I can’t do anything about it.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi suppressed his anger and gritted his teeth. “Do I still need you to teach me?”</p><p>Only then did Yu Lingdi hand over the exemption order.</p><p>Finally!</p><p>Finally!</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s eyes were almost filled with tears as he reached out his hand to snatch it at the speed of light.</p><p>Only the Heavens knew how much pain he had suffered, all for this lousy token?</p><p>Threatened by Ye Xiao…</p><p>Threatened by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man…</p><p>Deceived by the Taboo Puppet…</p><p>The Abyss Island was indeed filled with the foundational roots of the Saint Ascension.</p><p>At the very least, along the way, Jiang Buyi had seen countless opportunities in the various side halls of the First Hall of Sins. Some of them even tempted him.</p><p>Even the God Devil Eyes had followed behind him for an entire day…</p><p>One day!</p><p>However, because of the countdown to exile, Jiang Buyi did not even dare to touch her.</p><p>As long as he could make a move at will, even if he did not make a move in the end, this situation was much better than not daring to make a move after being restrained.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
