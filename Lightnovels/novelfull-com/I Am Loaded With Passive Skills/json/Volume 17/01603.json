(1)</p><p>“Many thanks for Brother Chen’s life-saving grace! I can’t repay your great kindness, I can only…” Gu Qinger, who had recovered after he took the Elixirs, didn’t even finish his words before he was slapped by Gu Qingyi and quickly knelt down.</p><p>“I’m sorry for being so rude. I didn’t expect this to happen. I’m sorry if I offended you.” Gu Qingyi gripped his sword and also knelt, full of apologies.</p><p>It was a misunderstanding!</p><p>So it was Brother Chen who had saved Second Junior Brother!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou calmly accepted the Gu brothers’ apologies and thanks.</p><p>If it had not been for him, Gu Qinger would have died at the hands of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>Especially when he kicked Gu Qinger when he battled with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. If he hadn’t kicked Gu Qinger aside at that time, this guy would have been shocked to death instantly while he was unconscious.</p><p>“Uh, stand up, it’s nothing.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lifted the two of them up. His curiosity had already worn off, and now he didn’t want to waste any more time. He just wanted to find the main palace, so he asked casually.</p><p>“On your way here, did you come across the main palace of the First Hall of Sins? I want to go to the main hall, but I can’t seem to find the way.”</p><p>The main palace?</p><p>Gu Qinger’s eyes were filled with confusion; he could not recall what had happened.</p><p>After he heard the narration of his savior, Chen Shu, he knew that he had done a lot of things while in a daze after being controlled by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, most of which were self-sacrificing.</p><p>As for what happened before that…</p><p>He only remembered that after he jumped off the cliff, he entered the Sky City, then wandered into the First Hall of Sins, and had a long tug-of-war with countless Void Attendants.</p><p>As soon as he started to fight, he forgot the time and couldn’t stop at all.</p><p>He couldn’t kill the Void Attendant, and the Void Attendant couldn’t do anything to him either. Everyone was in a frenzy of killing.</p><p>In the end, the hateful orange-masked man appeared and the Void Attendant disappeared. Gu Qinger forgot all about himself…</p><p>“I don’t seem to remember there being a main hall. I’ve never even seen a ‘Hall’ before. I’ve been walking in circles in the labyrinth.” Gu Qinger shook his head in confusion.</p><p>Gu Qingyi glanced at him coldly, which made Second Junior Brother so afraid that he looked down and didn’t dare to talk anymore. He then said.</p><p>“After I entered the First Hall of Sins, I went to a palace and a hall. One was called ‘Zhen Huang Palace’ and the other was called ‘No Walking Hall’. I wonder if that is the main palace that Brother Chen was looking for? I still remember the general location of those two.”</p><p>“Zhen Huang Palace is still fine. There’s not much danger. There’s only a giant stone statue that could talk. It’s just that it takes a long time to reply, it’s generally slow…”</p><p>“The No Walking Hall is very special. It’s hard to walk inside. I didn’t dare to stay for long. I set up the array and walked out and did not explore the place.”</p><p>Gu Qingyi described the decorations and styles of the palace and hall and did not miss any single detail.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou patiently listened to everything, but he found that he did not get any useful information.</p><p>“Did you sense any special presence?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had confidence in Gu Qingyi’s strength.</p><p>If there was anything strange about that hall, he believed that even if Gu Qinger went in, he wouldn’t be able to see it. But Gu Qingyi should be able to.</p><p>The three of them walked together, with Gu Qinger at the back of the group. He couldn’t help but pop his head out from behind his Eldest Senior Brother and asked curiously, “What do you mean by a special existence?”</p><p>Gu Qingyi didn’t interrupt; this was also the question he wanted to ask.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered for a moment and said, “For example, Demi-Saints being held captive…”</p><p>“Demi-Saint?” Gu Qinger’s pupils trembled. He looked at his Eldest Senior Brother from head to toe. He found that his Eldest Senior Brother had no injuries, not even a speck of dust on him. He was handsome and elegant, such a vast contrast to himself, all covered in blood.</p><p>He had an answer and spoke up on behalf of his Senior Eldest Brother, “I don’t think so.”</p><p>No matter how strong his Eldest Senior Brother was, he couldn’t defeat a Demi-Saint.</p><p>If he had actually encountered a Demi-Saint, he would have been dead by now.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at Gu Qinger’s bloodied state, who tried to make his presence known. He hesitated and said, “You should probably change your clothes and wash your face.”</p><p>Gu Qinger quickly went to change his clothes.</p><p>“No living Demi-Saints, but special ones!” Gu Qingyi’s eyes turned serious.</p><p>“Ah? Was there really a Demi-Saint? How did you survive?” Gu Qinger wiped the blood off his face, and stopped when he was halfway through getting dressed.</p><p>Was there such a big gap between Eldest Senior Brother and me?</p><p>That shouldn’t be the case!</p><p>Gu Qingyi glared at his Second Junior Brother and returned to the main topic, “The stone statue in Zhen Huang Palace had the fluctuations of a Demi-Saint. It can speak, but I didn’t dare to ask. I knew it didn’t know where my Junior Brother was, so I left.”</p><p>Gu Qinger, who was at the back, was putting on his belt. When he heard this, he felt a warmth in his heart, and his tears flowed out. He wiped his tears and said, touched, “Eldest Senior Brother, you’ve been looking for me?””</p><p>Gu Qingyi’s eyelids twitched; he couldn’t hold it in anymore.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>“You idiot!”</p><p>“I told you to guard the Lone Cliff, who asked you to come down?”</p><p>“If I didn’t look for you, I wouldn’t even know where you’ve died. How am I supposed to explain this to our Supreme Master?”</p><p>“If I didn’t look for you, would I be standing in front of you now?!”</p><p>“I …” Gu Qinger had snot in his nose and was too scared to even expel it. He went from being touched to remaining rooted to the spot.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled as he looked at the two brothers bantering in front of him. In his mind, an image of his little Junior Sister flashed by.</p><p>This lass was still uncontactable, and he didn’t know where she had flown off to. He hoped that nothing had happened to her.</p><p>But with her strength, nothing should happen to her.</p><p>The Void Attendant was very strong, but his little Junior Sister could still run if she couldn’t defeat it. Not to mention, if she used the God Devil Eyes, she could even control Rao Yaoyao.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
