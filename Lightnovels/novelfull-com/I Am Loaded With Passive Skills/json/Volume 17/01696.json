(4)</p><p>But…</p><p>It was too late!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had already locked onto him.</p><p>“Xuan Cang.”</p><p>She waved her hand.</p><p>She didn’t even invite the sword, but the Cang Godhood Sword flew out with a whoosh and landed in her palm, without even a hint of disrespect like before.</p><p>“Perceive the world of mortals…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao stood on top of the ruins of the Zhen Huang Palace. Huang Quan was far away at the peak of the silver river of time in the Nine Heavens.</p><p>However, her distant cold eyes woke up. The distance between the two of them shook, and a ripple of sword light surged in the middle, giving rise to a myriad of forms of the mortal world.</p><p>Huang Quan felt his soul tremble.</p><p>He saw babies taking their first steps from afar, an elder in a straw hat raising a hoe and squandering it into the fields, a golden dragon soaring down from the sky with a roar, and a withered sprout dying miserably in a dark alley at the corner of the street…</p><p>Endless scenery, people, plants, dragons, everything.</p><p>Huang Quan even saw many strange creatures that even he could not name.</p><p>He had no idea what Rao Yaoyao had experienced, what she had seen, or what she had comprehended about the myriad forms of the mortal world.</p><p>However, when these images were conjured, they were only displayed and had not been endowed with power.</p><p>Under the influence of the Demi-saint’s Power, Huang Quan was distracted.</p><p>“All Life Form…”</p><p>The moment her delicate voice reached his face, Huang Quan suddenly woke up.</p><p>He saw a dazzling sword light slashed through the myriad form of the mortal world that stood across the river of time. It was like a river splitting mountains, splitting him into two from the middle.</p><p>“Secular Sword!”</p><p>In the distance, Rao Yaoyao slowly sheathed her sword.</p><p>The Secular Sword could not do much damage when she was still one step away from the level of ‘All Life Form’.</p><p>It was like the embryo of a sword.</p><p>No matter how good the quality was, if it could not be sharpened, it would be difficult to cut someone with one strike.</p><p>But after becoming a Saint, everything was different.</p><p>The tempering in the past had become a series of procedures in the process of forging the sword. It was either hammering or quenching…</p><p>Now that the sword has been forged, it can be unsheathed at will.</p><p>With Rao Yaoyao’s talent, she still needed to cultivate for so many years before she could barely make any progress with the “All Life Form”. It could be imagined how powerful it was.</p><p>If the opponent wanted to break through, they had to have the same matching Secular Heart Refinement technique and have equal to or stronger strength than themselves.</p><p>These two conditions were even related by the word ‘and’, not ‘or’, which basically sealed the path of 99% of people in the same generation.</p><p>And this was only the first stage of the emotion sword technique.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had just begun!</p><p>“The return of the king…”</p><p>Yu Lingdi, who was carried upside down and witnessed as Huang Quan was cut into pieces by a sword, did not even have the time to pull out the sword from his back.</p><p>He used to feel uncomfortable every time he looked at Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>She was like a pieced monster.</p><p>She relied on her status to use the most expensive Cang Godhood Sword instead of her own saber.</p><p>She didn’t use other sword techniques either. She clearly knew them, but she seemed to look down on them.</p><p>She had used the emotion sword technique many times, but she had only used a few moves. It felt powerful, but it did not cause much damage.</p><p>She was like an expensive puzzle that had been broken and pieced together. Every piece was strong, but when it was filled in, it looked complete. It made people feel awkward in every way.</p><p>But today…</p><p>After Yu Lingdi finished watching this sword, he understood.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao only practiced one sword move and didn’t care about the opinions of others. She finally reached the end of her journey on Abyss Island and achieved enlightenment.</p><p>After she became a Saint, she extended the only plank on her body, and it was as long as the Great Wall!</p><p>After circling around herself, everything suddenly became invulnerable!</p><p>This one move was too powerful!</p><p>No demi-saint could compete with it!</p><p>“Stop looking. These are ancient swordsmen. Ancient swordsmen are a bunch of lunatics.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi carried the person. After a moment of silence, he couldn’t help but run as he spoke. He didn’t want to stay behind and be ordered around by Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>This world was very strange.</p><p>Survivorship bias led people to believe that ancient swordsmen were powerful.</p><p>However, they had completely forgotten that nature had eliminated a huge population base to select these few outstanding talents.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was thinking that perhaps Rao Yaoyao’s current performance could only be considered normal.</p><p>Even though he felt that he couldn’t even withstand a single sword strike from Rao Yaoyao, he still thought so.</p><p>To put it this way. If the higher void cultivators of the Spiritual Cultivation World were to be listed on the ‘Higher Void Ranking’, there would only be seven people on it.</p><p>Jiang Buyi did not even know if this ranking could be established.</p><p>However, he believed that those who could be listed, even if it was temporary, basically all of them had the ability to slay Saints in the higher void level.</p><p>In this era of Spiritual Cultivation, if the seven most talented Higher Void of the Spiritual Cultivation World were chosen, they would definitely be stronger than the Seven Sword Deity!</p><p>“Unfortunately…”</p><p>“What’s unfortunate?” Yu Lingdi heard Jiang Buyi’s regret.</p><p>“It’s a pity that it’s of the space attributes, just like her. It doesn’t belong to the five elements and transcends the Way of the Heavens, and is also incomprehensible.”</p><p>“What…”</p><p>Yu Lingdi wanted to say something, but the body of Huang Quan that had been split into two disappeared into an illusion and fused into the broken river of time.</p><p>He filled the position of a certain moment of Huang Quan.</p><p>At that moment, Huang Quan ran out without looking back or making a sound, fleeing as fast as possible!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao frowned and subconsciously spun the Cang Godhood Sword in her hand.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The thunder calamity above her head rumbled as if it was warning her…Those who crossed the boundary would die!</p><p>Yu Lingdi was carried away, and he took one last glance from afar.</p><p>He was still thinking about how the Mei Siren dared to fight against Ye Xiao’s saint calamity before becoming a Saint.</p><p>Even Rao Yaoyao Yaoyao had succeeded in becoming a Saint, she should be stronger than Mei Siren in terms of battle prowess. Would she be afraid of Huang Quan’s ‘Three Great saint calamity’?</p><p>His thoughts were not finished yet.</p><p>In the last scene, the Cang Godhood Sword cut off the three saint calamities with a backhand, even cutting off the one on the other side of Huang Quan. This was half of the power of repaying, but she didn’t plan to give any of it to Huang Quan.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
