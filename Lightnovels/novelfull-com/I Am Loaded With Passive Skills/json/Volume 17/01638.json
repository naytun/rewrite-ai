(5)</p><p>The surroundings were still the same as Zhen Huang Palace, but the giant statue was gone. Elder Han was gone, and so was Gu Qinger.</p><p>Only Gu Qingyi was left. He nodded slightly at the young man who stood a short distance away and said this in passing.</p><p>“Be careful of Yu Lingdi.”</p><p>With a swish, the fantasy realm ended.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou looked over again, Gu Qingyi and his brother had already left the grounds of the great array of Zhen Huang Palace and disappeared.</p><p>It seemed that Gu Qingyi had not been idle during this period of time. He had studied the water in the great hall. However, how could he be so sure that this was from Yu Lingdi… Xu Xiaoshou looked at the small puddle that Gu Qingyi just stepped on and fell into deep thought.</p><p>“Ji!”</p><p>Elder Han called out and pulled him back to reality. “Let’s get down to business.”</p><p>“Zhen Huang list!”</p><p>Without any further ado, Xu Xiaoshou spoke to the giant stone statue.</p><p>The giant statue was still very slow. It took a long time before the golden light board descended again.</p><p>“Did you see that? The secondary plane door,10,000 Void Crystals. The gray color is an indication that it had been exchanged. I’ve asked around, and it was just a day ago. You’re too late.” Xu Xiaoshou pointed at the gray words on the top of the roll and said to Elder Han who was perched on his shoulder.</p><p>Elder Han was silent. He naturally saw it too.</p><p>Just one step!</p><p>He had just been one step away!</p><p>If he had come a day earlier, perhaps things would not have developed to this extent.</p><p>Perhaps he would have already met Bazhun’an and walked on another path; he could have joined the Saint Servant and became the second-in-command.</p><p>However…</p><p>Fortune and misfortune were dependent on each other. In the end, he met Chen Tan. From the looks of it, it seemed to be better?</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>At this moment Xu Xiaoshou saw the only line of words that was still lit up among the top ten of the Zhen Huang list. It was ranked second, and the lighted words meant that it had not been exchanged by anyone yet.</p><p>“Heavenly Ancestor’s Blessing, Void Crystals:10,000.”</p><p>These were the only two items that required 10,000 Void Crystals.</p><p>“Heavenly Ancestor’s Blessing, 10,000. Just like the secondary plane door, does it mean that the two are of equal value?” Xu Xiaoshou waited for a long time but did not receive any reply from the giant statue. He could only speculate.</p><p>“Bullsh*t!” Elder Han sneered. “The value seems to be the same, but the Heavenly Ancestor’s Blessing needs to be acknowledged by the Heavenly Ancestor’s Will before it can be enjoyed. This thing is useless even if it’s exchanged. It would be better to exchange it for something else.”</p><p>This was the reason why it was ranked second, yet no one had exchanged for it… Xu Xiaoshou understood. Of course, he knew that the 10,000 Void Crystals were also part of the reason.</p><p>It was too expensive.</p><p>It was expensive and not worth the amount, so no one was willing to waste it.</p><p>“Give me a Heavenly Ancestor’s Blessing.” Xu Xiaoshou said to the giant statue.</p><p>“Are you crazy?” Elder Han was shocked. He was stunned for a moment before he reacted. “I already said that this thing is useless.”</p><p>“Perhaps I can obtain the recognition of the Heavenly Ancestor’s Will? ”</p><p>“The Heavenly Ancestor is dead!”</p><p>“Who knows? Do you know who the Heavenly Ancestor was?”</p><p>“Uh, I don’t know about this…”</p><p>“If you don’t even know about the Heavenly Ancestor, then you must have only heard the rumor that the ‘Heavenly Ancestor is dead’. You’re not going to use these 10,000 Void Crystals, are you going to keep them for the New Year? What if the Heavenly Ancestor can only be resurrected through this Heavenly Ancestor’s Blessing?”</p><p>“That is impossible!”</p><p>“Anything is possible.”</p><p>The 10,000 Void Crystals were handed over without any further explanation.</p><p>The giant statue spat out a viscous liquid wrapped in a light cluster that emitted a faint fragrance.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even know the function of this item, whether it was for oral consumption or external use, but he exchanged it without hesitation.</p><p>What a coincidence!</p><p>I currently have 10,000 Void Crystals in my hands. It just so happened that the secondary plane door is gone, and I’m only left with the Heavenly Ancestor’s Blessing, that is worth 10,000 Void Crystals.</p><p>Could this be the gift that Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison told me about?</p><p>Or was it another kind of coincidence or arrangement of fate?</p><p>The fellow who had exchanged for the secondary plane door did not want to exchange for the Heavenly Ancestor’s Blessing?</p><p>Perhaps not. There were probably not enough Void Crystals to go round.</p><p>Even the Inner Island of the Abyss Island had spent so much effort to gather money for Elder Han before he could amass 10,000 Void Crystals. It was likely that the exchange for the secondary door plane had already caused that fellow to suffer a great loss.</p><p>Since that was the case, if he didn’t obtain the Heavenly Ancestor’s Blessing now, this thing might disappear the next day.</p><p>At that time, it would be too late for regrets!</p><p>“What’s the use of the Heavenly Ancestor’s Blessing?” Xu Xiaoshou held the item and couldn’t figure out the mystery. He asked the giant statue again.</p><p>After a long while, the giant statue finally spoke.</p><p>“Swallow… you can get… Heavenly Ancestor… power…”</p><p>“Listen!” Xu Xiaoshou looked at Elder Han.</p><p>“Listen again!” Elder Han didn’t look at them at all. His eyes were fierce as if he knew the inside story about the Zhen Huang list.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waited for a while. The giant statue really had something to say!</p><p>“First… receive… Heavenly Ancestor… Acknowledgement…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face darkened.</p><p>Was this a scam? He only spoke after such a long time.</p><p>However, he did not regret having exchanged for the Heavenly Ancestor’s Blessing.</p><p>The power of the Heavenly Ancestors-the power of the ancestral source. He had only grasped the aura of the power of the evil God and could pretend to be a Higher Void. No one could see through it.</p><p>If there was really a chance to obtain the recognition of the Heavenly Ancestor’s Will, wouldn’t he be able to take off on the spot?</p><p>“What if I don’t get recognition after I forcefully swallow it?” Xu Xiaoshou raised the viscous liquid in his hand and opened his mouth to swallow it.</p><p>Elder Han wasn’t sure. He hesitated and said, “You can try.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou really tried it in the absence of any accelerated heartbeat from the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale.</p><p>He lifted the sticky liquid in his hand.</p><p>The next second, he put it down.</p><p>“Eh, what did I want to do earlier?” Xu Xiaoshou frowned as he pondered on this.</p><p>Elder Han was amused. “I knew that this would be the result. This means that you haven’t received the recognition of the Heaven Ancestor’s Will!”</p><p>“Then how can I get the recognition?” Xu Xiaoshou asked again after he learnt about the result of his previous attempt through Elder Han.</p><p>“I don’t know!” Elder Han shook his head arrogantly. “But they said that you will know about the power of the ancestral source when the time is right.”</p><p>Heavenly Ancestor…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered over this.</p><p>He felt that there was a basis that the Heavenly Ancestor was still alive. He had a conversation with the Void Attendant and he had guessed that the spirit of the Abyss Island was the spirit of the Heavenly Ancestor!</p><p>He would even give people a ‘death countdown’, so he definitely wasn’t dead.</p><p>In other words, what kind of good things did the Void Attendant, the Void Race, and the Abyss Island have to do to gain his recognition?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou put away the Heavenly Ancestor’s Blessing and didn’t pay any more attention to it.</p><p>He would keep it under wraps for now.</p><p>If there was no follow-up, it would not be a loss to take this thing. In any case, it was free.</p><p>If there was a result, then it would be great. If he obtained the power of the Heavenly Ancestor for free, even the Holy Divine Palace would die of anger!</p><p>“Elder Han.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly looked outside Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>Without Gu Qinger, the great hall was extremely quiet, so quiet that it made people feel afraid.</p><p>There were clearly many battles that erupted outside. There were all kinds of signs that made the people feel that a storm was about to brew.</p><p>“Hmm?” Elder Han raised his head. He could sense Chen Tan’s emotions and had the same thoughts.</p><p>“How long would it take to become a Saint?”</p><p>“You mean that Rao person? I don’t know. Maybe half a day, maybe ten days or half a month. It would be best if she was struck by the Thunder Calamity for a year! I’m good at this. As long as we run fast, it’ll take her a long time to lock onto us after she becomes a Saint.”</p><p>“We’re still one step away. We have to find someone first. Perhaps this time, we can really kill a Saint…”</p><p>Elder Han didn’t feel anything about the Saint. Too many Demi-Saints had died in front of him. He had always been the monkey that received the warning.</p><p>“Who are you looking for?”</p><p>“This.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou handed over a seed.</p><p>Through the seed that was filled with vitality, he knew that his little junior sister was not in any danger now. However, Jiang Buyi was by her side. This was a kind of risk in itself.</p><p>Why did he want to take in Elder Han?</p><p>It was because a Void General alone might not be able to stop Jiang Buyi! Xu Xiaoshou alone couldn’t find his little junior sister!</p><p>“Can you sense her aura?”</p><p>Elder Han glanced at Lord Chen Tan’s solemn expression and realized that this was no small matter.</p><p>He held the tree seed with his left claw and the green stone with his right claw. At the same time, he released his Saint’s will.</p><p>“Swish…”</p><p>There seemed to be a whirlwind in the great hall. Ripples passed through the small pool and entered into the barrier of Zhen Huang Palace’s great array. Finally, they disappeared into the horizon.</p><p>“I can.”</p><p>“Then let’s go!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
