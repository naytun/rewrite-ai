(2)</h1><p>1618 The Master of Void Island, the Door of the Secondary Plane! (2)</p><p>“You were under his control and wanted to attack me as soon as you came. But you were in a state of higher void, so I knocked you out directly.”</p><p>“Based on this situation, the Void Crystal is most likely left behind by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. I’m not sure why he left it.”</p><p>Gu Qingyi was deep in thought.</p><p>Yama?</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man?</p><p>Chen Shu had beaten away the Five Decays of Heaven and Man?</p><p>What happened after that was worth pondering…</p><p>But now, he definitely wouldn’t dwell on these small details.</p><p>“If you can’t remember, then don’t think about it.” Gu Qingyi patted Junior Brother’s shoulder, signalling him to stop tormenting himself.</p><p>“I don’t know, I don’t know…” Gu Qinger’s facial expression is one of extreme agony. He refuse to accept that a part of his memory was gone.</p><p>He was so powerful and had yet to crush Senior Brother or trample on his supreme master. How could he be controlled to the point of losing Godhood by just any random enemy?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t bear to see this and wanted to say something. He eventually remained silent.</p><p>He felt that he couldn’t say it. The Five Decays of Heaven and Man seemed to be treating him well, but he really didn’t believe that there were any unprovoked acts of kindness. They were probably using him for their own purposes, those which he didn’t expect.</p><p>So, after scanning the Zhen Huang Palace and still not sensing the existence of anything “watching”, he said, “It’s not that you’re weak. It’s because you’ve encountered the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.”</p><p>“The Five Decays of Heaven and Man is one of the Five Extreme Physiques, the Body of Decay. He obtained the Three Loathsome Eyes from the Lei Family’s Eyes. He’s capable of manipulating people’s hearts and he’s guarded by the power of Space-Time from Yama Huang Quan.”</p><p>“It’s absolutely normal that you can’t beat him.”</p><p>Gu Qingyi’s heart tightened as he listened. He grasped the shoulder of his Junior Brother in one swift motion.</p><p>He could understand Chen Shu’s words.</p><p>Hearing this, it was too normal for his Junior Brother not to be able to defeat the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>However, he thought, “At what level was Chen Shu that he could save my Junior Brother from its hands?”</p><p>“Received alert, passive points, +1.”</p><p>“I didn’t save him for any reason. Of course, you can also think of it as me having ulterior motives. It’s just that I don’t know why he ran away halfway through the fight. The Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s strength is far more superior than mine.” Xu Xiaoshou said.</p><p>Seeing Chen Shu’s frankness, Gu Qingyi was somewhat ashamed.</p><p>Brother Chen didn’t have to say these things. He and the entire Burial Sword Tomb would have owed him a favour.</p><p>However, he still said it without hesitation. He knew that if he said it too thoroughly, it would cause him to be disliked, but he still said it.</p><p>“Brother Chen is magnanimous.” Gu Qingyi thought to himself, finally stood up, held his sword and bowed solemnly, “It’s my fault!”</p><p>“It’s fine. I don’t understand this matter myself either, so I can’t explain the ins and outs. It’s normal for you to have doubts.” Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand and did not bother at all, “I also believe that if you see injustice, you would lend a helping hand to the victim who is also an ancient swordsman.”</p><p>After saying this, Xu Xiaoshou actually felt a little ashamed.</p><p>When he recognized Gu Qinger, he really did want to save him immediately.</p><p>Nonetheless, he felt that he couldn’t beat the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, so his second move was to run away.</p><p>If the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had wanted to kill Gu Qinger, he couldn’t risk his life to save him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that he was not a gentleman and that he could only do his best.</p><p>Throughout the journey, the only time he lost control was when his junior sister was targeted by Yi. The rest were all within his plans.</p><p>Gu Qinger was not his junior sister, and Xu Xiaoshou would not risk his life for him.</p><p>“Thank you for saving my life, Brother Chen.” Gu Qinger, who had recovered at this moment, thanked him sincerely.</p><p>He thought that Chen Shu had taken care of him when he was exhausted and fatigued after he fought against the Void Attendant, but he didn’t expect there to be such a reason, as well as the unexpected presence of characters like the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>This saving grace was completely different from the previous saving grace!</p><p>“You have already thanked me.” Xu Xiaoshou smiled and pointed to the Void Crystal. “The Five Decays of Heaven and Man have the power of decay. It may not be of any use to you to keep this thing, but it happens to be useful to me, so I won’t be polite with you.”</p><p>“Please do as you wish, Brother Chen.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded, and without further ado, he presented fifty Void Crystals.</p><p>“I want to exchange for a Death Exemption Token.”</p><p>The giant statue apathetically watched the exchange of stolen money in front of it. Without any hesitation, it opened its mouth and a ray of holy light swallowed all the Void Crystals.</p><p>Right after, it spat out a black token.</p><p>The token was very ancient, even Xu Xiaoshou could not understand the patterns engraved on it. He was just about to interpret these inscriptions from the perspective of the “Weaving Expertise”.</p><p>However, with the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale throbbing, Xu Xiaoshou felt uncomfortable and dared not mess around anymore.</p><p>“It’s a power that I cannot currently come into contact with. It may not be dangerous if I don’t interpret it, but if I do, I might be in danger?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou put aside his curiosity and examined the appearance of the token.</p><p>It was all black, with a strange inscription, and when the spiritual light flickered, there was a “death” character crossed out by a diagonal line, which meant “exempted from death”?</p><p>“How do I use it?” Xu Xiaoshou asked, looking at the statue.</p><p>“Stick to… Forehead… Automatic… Remove… Death… Countdown… ”</p><p>Gu Qingyi and Gu Qing Er stared at Brother Chen curiously as he placed the command token worth fifty Void Crystals on his forehead.</p><p>Death countdown?</p><p>Was this the reason why Brother Chen said he only had four days left?</p><p>What did he do to have a death countdown? Why didn’t I?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
