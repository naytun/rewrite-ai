(1)</p><p>“Saint Ascension?”</p><p>To be honest, neither Huang Quan nor Mei Siren expected someone from Zhen Huang Palace to choose to become a Saint.</p><p>At a glance, that fellow seemed to be in a miserable state…</p><p>Not only was his aura dispirited and depressed, but even his semi-saint person was fake. He had used a blood-red bead to replace it.</p><p>Please!</p><p>This is a Saint Calamity, could you please be more serious about it?</p><p>How could be this be termed a Saint Ascension? Suicide was more like it!</p><p>Even Huang Quan felt dazed.</p><p>He didn’t think that there would be such a higher void in this world who would fool around with a Saint Ascension.</p><p>But soon, he realized the other party’s true intentions.</p><p>“Blood World Pearl…”</p><p>The Blood World Pearl, one of the top ten Great Psionic Weapons, indeed had the ability to replace the semi-saint person in a sense.</p><p>Perhaps, as long as this higher void was strong enough and in a good state, he could really use the Blood World Pearl to break through the Demi-Saint shackles.</p><p>As long as he could find an actual semi-saint person during this short period of time, there might be a slight possibility that he could go from ‘Mad Saint’ and achieve a successful Saint Ascension!</p><p>However, this was not the key.</p><p>What mattered most now was that the person who was set to become a Saint was not in the right state at all. She would definitely not succeed, but she still had the crazy idea to use the Blood World Pearl to replace the semi-saint person to become a Saint.</p><p>The plan was to use the Saint Calamity to break the space-time restriction that Huang Quan had imposed on Jiang Buyi.</p><p>Under the Saint Calamity, everything was illusory!</p><p>Huang Quan’s dual space time attributes had not comprehended the Upanishad. It was impossible to be detached.</p><p>“That was the idea.”</p><p>“But was it necessary to sacrifice your life for this?”</p><p>Huang Quan chose not to resist the Saint Calamity because he was not crazy.</p><p>Mei Siren followed suit. With a swoosh, he retreated and tried to hide his Perception in order to avoid being sensed by the Saint Calamity.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The first blood-colored Thunder Calamity of the Nine Heavens descended.</p><p>The First Hall of Sins was hit and Zhen Huang Palace was also destroyed. The lightning struck Ye Xiao, who was underneath Jiang Buyi.</p><p>The Blood World Pearl expanded and absorbed most of the power. Ye Xiao naturally had to bear the rest of the attack.</p><p>“Aww!”</p><p>The shrill cry of an owl sounded.</p><p>Ye Xiao was directly blasted into the deep underground pit. She was already in a bad state.</p><p>However, the goal of this Thunder Calamity had been achieved!</p><p>The void cracked. The space-time restriction that restrained Jiang Buyi suddenly split open.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi was overjoyed. At this moment, he was especially glad that he had signed a contract with the Holy Divine Palace in advance.</p><p>Otherwise, based on his previous indifference with regard to Ye Xiao’s life and death, Ye Xiao would not have risked her life to save him.</p><p>And this time, the Holy Divine Palace had risked their lives just to release him. Jiang Buyi was an old fox, so how could he not know what kind of cooperation he should make and what kind of actions he should take?</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>With a swish, he rushed in front of Yu Lingdi. “Hand it over! ”</p><p>Yu Lingdi had already prepared the Exemption Order and was about to throw it to him when he suddenly saw Huang Quan, who had retreated to the end, raise his hand.</p><p>You can’t throw it!</p><p>In the face of the space-time attribute, even if Jiang Buyi was a Demi-Saint, Huang Quan would have ten thousand ways to intercept him before he could get his hands on the Exemption Order</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi opened his hand, and the Exemption Order dropped into the lake. It made a splash and then merged into his right arm.</p><p>He withdrew his hand.</p><p>“The space is wrongly divided!”</p><p>Sure enough, in the next second, Huang Quan’s fingertips moved, and a spatial rift opened in front of Yu Lingdi.</p><p>The crack was like a pair of sharp blades and lightly dislocated his arm.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s right arm that had just swallowed the Exemption Order was sliced off on the spot!</p><p>“Ugh!”</p><p>Pain engulfed him and Yu Lingdi let out a muffled groan.</p><p>The strength of Huang Quan’s attack was too powerful!</p><p>Just like what the Saint Servant Elder Sleeveless had said. In the face of absolute power, his Cutting Path Level Water-type Upanishad was still a little weak. He couldn’t withstand Huang Quan’s harmful attack!</p><p>Moreover, Yu Lingdi was currently not in the best condition.</p><p>The pain from his broken arm seemed to have affected his mental damage that had yet to recover from the attack of the God Devil Eyes.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s entire body spasmed, and his head seemed to have exploded. Even his movements had slowed down.</p><p>“Good opportunity!”</p><p>A fierce light burned in Huang Quan’s eyes.</p><p>He had thought that the two seriously sick patients were at Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>A pale youth covered in blood and a bird that could not cause any waves. Jiang Buyi was the one that mattered most.</p><p>As soon as he took action, he realized that one of them was the Spirit Division Chief, Yu Lingdi, and the other was the Dark Division Chief, Ye Xiao.</p><p>This was too tragic!</p><p>How did they end up like this?</p><p>But no matter what happened to the two of them, Yu Lingdi had lost an arm, and Huang Quan wanted to be the first in the arena.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>At this moment, another bolt of lightning struck down from the Nine Heavens.</p><p>Huang Quan’s attack was hidden in the second layer of space time. This way, he could avoid being sensed by the Thunder Calamity.</p><p>However, if he wanted Yu Lingdi’s head, he had no choice but to show himself.</p><p>However, this was no different than when he spurned the Saint Calamity and provoked the Holy Path.</p><p>Therefore, when the sounds of the Saint Calamity rang out again, Huang Quan weighed the pros and cons. After that, he sobered up and chose to stop and stay hidden in another space-time.</p><p>“Hand!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi didn’t dare to reveal his Demi-Saint aura, so his speed was very slow.</p><p>He was a Demi-Saint, yet he walked about the streets in the midst of the Saint Calamity like a fat rat in broad daylight. He was simply courting death.</p><p>This was the reason why Elder Han was chased by Rao Yaoyao amid the Saint Calamity. He didn’t dare to resist at all; it was too easy to be struck by lightning!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
