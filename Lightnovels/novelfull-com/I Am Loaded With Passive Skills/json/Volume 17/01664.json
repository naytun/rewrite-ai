(1)</p><p>“We’re here!”</p><p>“Finally…”</p><p>Upon his return to Zhen Huang Palace’s great array, Jiang Buyi felt a sense of familiarity that he had not felt for a long time.</p><p>He had clearly left this place not too long ago…</p><p>The earlier battle, the fear and trepidation along the way, until now, everything came as a relief.</p><p>“Fortunately, everything is fine.”</p><p>He took out the Array Shattering Key and inserted it into Zhen Huang Palace’s great array.</p><p>Jiang Buyi suddenly found it funny.</p><p>How did a dignified Demi-Saint become such a frightened bird on the Abyss Island; he even became excessively worried?</p><p>How could there be so many dark sides in this world?</p><p>Under the illumination of the Demi-Saint’s light, all the unknown and dangerous things would not have dared to approach.</p><p>What was wrong with him? He was so paranoid that he even felt that someone would intercept him along the way.</p><p>There were only so many lower Demi-Saints in the world. Who would have the time to kill the other Demi-Saints?</p><p>And if anyone below the Demi-Saint Realm wanted his life…</p><p>Jiang Buyi shook his head and smiled.</p><p>“Haha.”</p><p>With a buzz, a crack appeared in the Zhen Huang Palace’s great array and it opened into a door. It did not trigger any counterattack.</p><p>This was the power of the Array Shattering Key.</p><p>As a Demi-Saint, Jiang Buyi’s family background was extremely strong. He could even easily find a treasure to deal with the Abyss Island’s great hall’s spiritual array.</p><p>He moved forward.</p><p>He walked into the spiritual array with a smile.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>“Die! Go to hell!”</p><p>“Lunatic! Lunatic! I will definitely kill you!”</p><p>“Ahhhh…”</p><p>Heart-wrenching screams echoed in all directions. They were filled with pain, torture, and seemed to be mixed with violent and chaotic power. It made people feel dizzy.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was a Demi-Saint.</p><p>This level of mental corruption could not invade his sacred physique.</p><p>He was only a little confused after being greatly shocked, but he did not act rashly. He silently looked toward the direction of the main hall.</p><p>There were two people in the main hall and both of them looked very miserable.</p><p>The first person he saw was a young man who clutched his head and writhed in pain on the ground.</p><p>Blood flowed out of his seven orifices, and he had a ferocious look on his face. The blood that flowed out of his body filled almost half of the great hall.</p><p>From time to time, bouts of devilish energy would burst from his head. It shattered his muscles and merged into the blood under his body.</p><p>The entire main hall of Zhen Huang Palace was filled with a strange and terrifying color.</p><p>“I’ll kill you, I’ll kill you…”</p><p>The young man muttered continuously, as if he was possessed.</p><p>He jerked again, and a distorted Power Upanishad Formation bloomed under his body. With a bang, it exploded again.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s eyelids twitched wildly.</p><p>He finally recognized this bloodied fellow.</p><p>“Spirit Division Chief, Yu Lingdi?”</p><p>“Why was he here? What happened?”</p><p>“This is… a sign of cultivation deviation?”</p><p>He shifted his gaze and Jiang Buyi saw another corpse at the side… Hmm, it wasn’t a corpse. It still had some traces of life.</p><p>It was an illusory woman with a black feather cloak draped over her shoulders. Her body was tightly curled up and she trembled as if she was cold.</p><p>Her condition was very unstable.</p><p>Occasionally, she would take a long breath. After she inhaled for a long while, it seemed that she had died. Then after a long pause, she would inhale again.</p><p>Every time this happened, she could not maintain her human form and would turn into a weak three-legged black owl.</p><p>But when she took another breath, she would return to her human form.</p><p>“Dark Division Chief, Ye Xiao…”</p><p>“Why was she here too?”</p><p>“This isn’t right. She should be with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man at this time, right?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi was confused.</p><p>He raised his hand and glanced at the Array Shattering Key in his hand, then he looked back.</p><p>The gap in Zhen Huang Palace’s great array created by his spiritual array was slowly closing.</p><p>Jiang Buyi did not need to pinch himself to know that this was not an illusion. He had come to the real Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>Yu Lingdi and Ye Xiao were real too!</p><p>However, the tragic states of these two people were simply unprecedented, Jiang Buyi had never heard of it before, nor had he seen it before.</p><p>Not only were their injuries severe, but their Perception abilities were clearly extremely weak.</p><p>Jiang Buyi had stood at the door for such a long time, yet they actually did not notice the person outside the hall at all!</p><p>“Yu Lingdi… Uhh.” Ye Xiao spoke in a trembling voice.</p><p>“Kill! Kill! I’ll kill you, you d*mned thing…” Yu Lingdi clutched his head as his eyeballs bulged. He rolled to the left and right a few times, and blood flowed continuously out of his body.</p><p>Mu Zixi’s mental attack had been transmitted through the water-type Clone. He would take a while to recover.</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>“My time… Uh, uh, uh, not much left. Bring the information to…”</p><p>“What… Oh, information?” Yu Lingdi grunted in pain and tried to turn his head in Ye Xiao’s direction.</p><p>In the great hall, these two miserable fellows laid close to each other. They were so close, yet worlds apart. Their bodies twitched a few times from time to time, and they tried their best to look at each other. It was as if they communicated through their illnesses and used all their strength to exchange information.</p><p>Jiang Buyi hesitated and wanted to take a step forward, but he still stopped. He pricked up his ears and listened silently.</p><p>“Mu Zixi, Ultimate Life Demon Physique, God Devil Eyes, Lei family survivor…” Ye Xiao found it difficult to complete a sentence. She paused for a long time before she continued.</p><p>“Mu Xiaogong, Yunlun Mountain Range…”</p><p>“The same person!”</p><p>“Yi died at her hands!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s convulsions suddenly stopped. In the next second, his body twitched even more violently.</p><p>“The First Pavilion in the Sky, Young Master Xu…”</p><p>“Saint Servant, Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>“The same person!”</p><p>“Investigate him!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
