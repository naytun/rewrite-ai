(5)</p><p>Jiang Buyi was practically stunned as he watched Huang Quan fall from having control of everything to the lowest point in a short instant in front of him.</p><p>It was just like how Huang Quan did not notice Yu Lingdi.</p><p>From the beginning to the end, Jiang Buyi didn’t think that Yu Lingdi would be of any use in this battle.</p><p>Water-type Upanishad was strong, but Cutting Path was too weak.</p><p>In their eyes, this young man, Yu Lingdi, should just be slacking off in the Arena. They couldn’t count on him.</p><p>But now, this character who was supposed to be a bystander had taken advantage of Huang Quan’s contempt to control his body.</p><p>In an instant, the most important thing for a Spiritual Cultivator, a spiritual source, was completely gone!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Nine Heavens Thunder Calamity rose again.</p><p>This time, it lit up the darkness of the Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>Jiang Buyi stared blankly at the intangible bloody hand that stretched out from under Huang Quan’s mask.</p><p>That hand held the exemption order and gently patted his forehead.</p><p>“Jiang Buyi, what are you waiting for?” Yu Lingdi’s voice sounded from Huang Quan’s body.</p><p>“Pa.”</p><p>A soft sound rang out.</p><p>The exemption order turned into a stream of light and disappeared.</p><p>Jiang Buyi looked at his mind…The countdown to exile had disappeared!</p><p>At this moment, the world lit up. The world that should have been dark returned to daylight!</p><p>Jiang Buyi felt that he had been hit by happiness.</p><p>He had clearly fallen from heaven to hell in the last Aura.</p><p>But now…He simply loved this young man!</p><p>“Yu Lingdi, I owe you a favor! Hahahaha…”</p><p>Jiang Buyi soared into the sky, his face glowing. His aura surged, and the cloud-type Holy Power gathered in his right palm. He was about to blast the mask of Huang Quan and kill him in one blow.</p><p>Huang Quan’s body exploded into mist with a bang. Yu Lingdi escaped with a pale face and shouted,</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>“Take me and run!”</p><p>“I told you that there’s only one exemption order left. You killed one Huang Quan, and there’s still a Mei Siren behind you.”</p><p>“How many times can you attack?”</p><p>When Jiang Buyi heard that, he suddenly reacted as well. He was blinded by hatred.</p><p>As a demi-saint, if he went overboard, he would be remembered by the Abyss Island’s spirit, and the countdown to exile would start.</p><p>As for Huang Quan?</p><p>He didn’t even need to use his ultimate kill.</p><p>As long as he used space-time restrictions and escaped, the possibility of him being targeted by the Abyss Island Spirit and hanging a countdown timer was extremely low. However, his ability was very disgusting.</p><p>This wave…</p><p>Not worth it!</p><p>Jiang Buyi immediately figured out the key point. With a wave of his hand, he picked up Yu Lingdi, who was so weak that he could not move after controlling Huang Quan, and fled out of Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>“Can you escape?”</p><p>Huang Quan’s voice suddenly sounded.</p><p>Coincidentally, at this moment.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Silver light suddenly poured down from the Nine Heavens.</p><p>A river of time descended from the sky, blocking Jiang Buyi and Yu Lingdi’s path.</p><p>This was a very strange scene.</p><p>Some scenes that had just happened here quietly flowed in the river of time that ran through the entire Zhen Huang Palace: Ye Xiao’s transcendence of tribulation, Yu Lingdi’s severed arm, Mei Siren’s fan slashing the saint calamity, Huang Quan being parasitized by Yu Lingdi …</p><p>Time had witnessed everything.</p><p>Huang Quan digested another drop of Holy Blood in his palm.</p><p>He slowly walked into the river of time and stretched out his hand. He crushed the scene of the saint calamity above Mei Siren’s head.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Mei Siren, who was resisting the saint calamity in the air and felt that he was about to lose, was shocked.</p><p>Above his head, the saint calamity suddenly disappeared!</p><p>Huang Quan walked in the river of time and digested another drop of Holy Blood.</p><p>He grabbed a certain version of himself that was still in his peak condition before the battle and threw it out.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A Huang Quan flew out of reality.</p><p>Huang Quan, whose spiritual source had been scattered by the Yu Lingdi, took the initiative to walk into the river of time, filling the gap in the exchange of identities.</p><p>Time continued to pass.</p><p>Never been disordered.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s pupils constricted.</p><p>Yu Lingdi paled in shock.</p><p>How strange was this method?</p><p>Mei Siren who was above his head also looked down from above. He was shocked to see the newborn Huang Quan that was thrown out. He continued to step forward and walked towards Jiang Buyi.</p><p>The moment the river of time froze, it was the scene of Yu Lingdi parasitizing Huang Quan. The bloody hand stretched out, holding the exemption order and slapping it at Jiang Buyi’s forehead.</p><p>Huang Quan stretched out his hand.</p><p>Spirit source surged out of two fingers.</p><p>He intended to crush the exemption order at that moment!</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s eyes instantly turned red. He left Yu Lingdi and charged towards Huang Quan like a madman, wanting to stop his actions.</p><p>He had guessed something!</p><p>Huang Quan had the power to rewrite history.</p><p>If he crushed this exemption order from the previous space-time, would it mean that the countdown to his exile would come back?</p><p>Because history had been rewritten, it was equivalent to Yu Lingdi bidding for his exemption order at that time.</p><p>His exemption order shattered.</p><p>What he slapped was air!</p><p>Then, all his freedom would cease to exist!</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>Holy Power burst out from Jiang Buyi’s body. The Holy Light of Saints descended from the sky and shot towards Huang Quan, wanting to force Huang Quan to crush the exemption order.</p><p>At this moment!</p><p>Huang Quan suddenly turned around!</p><p>His movements seemed to have been accelerated by time, so fast that he left behind a series of afterimages of different movements.</p><p>Correspondingly, on the river of time, various scenes of Huang Quan’s next actions appeared in advance.</p><p>He reached to pull out his knife and the bandage fell off…</p><p>He lowered his body and dodged the attack…</p><p>He rushed forward quickly and cut his throat with a knife …</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>It was only when Huang Quan held the Hun Che and stopped behind Jiang Buyi that the acceleration of time returned to normal.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was unable to react at all!</p><p>His time was slowed down, while Huang Quan’s time was accelerated.</p><p>In this situation, his reaction speed was like a turtle crawling!</p><p>“I’m sorry, I don’t have the ability to rewrite history at that moment because you’re a demi-saint.”</p><p>“But my Hun Che can cut through the defense of all souls in the world. I don’t think Demi-Saint Jiang can defend against it, right?”</p><p>Huang Quan smiled and slowly put the thin knife in his hand back into his back.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was already unable to complete the action of turning back.</p><p>A black line appeared on his neck.</p><p>From what the saint’s will could see, Huang Quan’s thin blade seemed transparent after it escaped the binding of the sealing belt.</p><p>It was a soul weapon!</p><p>This was the most powerful soul weapon!</p><p>“Hun Che…”</p><p>Jiang Buyi felt his thoughts slow down. He knew this name.</p><p>One of the nine supreme divine weapons, as famous as the Evil Sin Bow of Ai Cangsheng that loves all life. Its ability is to cut through all soul defenses. As long as it can hit, it is almost impossible to break.</p><p>Jiang Buyi did not even have time to react at the moment of Huang Quan’s attack.</p><p>The speed at which those soul weapons that were automatically protecting their bodies came out was slowed down. The soul weapons that had directly flashed out were all cut in half by the sharp Hun Che.</p><p>“Ugh!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi choked. He felt his head was muddled and extremely uncomfortable.</p><p>He was not good at the Dao of the soul, so he had spent a large number of his assets on the soul-protecting holy weapon.</p><p>However, they were like trash compared to ‘Hun Che’ of the nine supreme divine weapons.</p><p>In mid-air, Mei Siren, who lost the saint calamity as his opponent, revealed a Ghost Inscription in his eyes and silently looked down.</p><p>Just now, under the acceleration of time, even he did not realize that Huang Quan’s original intention was to attack!</p><p>But now, he could see it clearly.</p><p>With the black line on Jiang Buyi’s neck as the boundary, his soul body was cut into two after being cut by Hun Che. His head was separated and there was no possibility of recovery.</p><p>“The death of a demi-saint?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
