(7)</h1><p>1692 Crazy Half-Saint, Three Tribulation Eyes, Buried Together! (7)</p><p>“Three Tribulation Eyes…”</p><p>After being stunned for a moment, Huang Quan’s pupils seemed to split open. He roared, “Don’t look at it!”</p><p>He finally understood why Jiang Buyi would throw out the Three Loathsome Eyes as bait.</p><p>It turned out that he had kept these three eyes for himself!</p><p>The Three Tribulation Eyes was one of the specific manifestations of the punishment of the Lei family’s control over the Way of the Heavens.</p><p>Those who forcefully manifested the Three Tribulation Eyes would begin at the Cutting Path Stage. They would have to pass the Thunder Calamity that corresponded to the cultivator’s cultivation level as punishment.</p><p>However, those who faced it would have to endure three times the Thunder Calamity that their current cultivation went through.</p><p>This was actually a form of tempering.</p><p>This was because the stronger the Thunder Calamity, the greater the impact one would get after one succeeded in the ‘transcend the tribulation’!</p><p>However, since ancient times, almost no one at the Demi-Saint stage had been able to pass the triple Saint Calamity at the same time!</p><p>So…</p><p>Tempering also became the start of evil!</p><p>Obviously, Huang Quan’s warning was too late.</p><p>Under the guidance of the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree and Yu Lingdi’s curiosity, the three of them in the ruins of Zhen Huang Palace had already turned to look at the Three Tribulation Eyes.</p><p>“Ga…ga…ga…”</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s perverted laughter grew louder and louder, and finally became totally maniacal.</p><p>The three eyes on his face blinked at the same time, and the Calamity Power shot into the three people who looked at him.</p><p>Jiang Buyi faced the sky and laughed wildly. He raised both his hands and the malevolence on his face was almost equivalent to the four huge words that said: Die together!</p><p>“All of you shall be buried with me, all of you shall go to hell, hahaha!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>An explosion sounded in the Nine Heavens.</p><p>Cracking sounds could be heard from all over the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>The patch of extreme grounds shook violently as if it could not withstand the terrifying power of four people who underwent the Thunder Calamity at the same time.</p><p>The Three Tribulation Eyes had almost zero effect on ordinary people.</p><p>However, when one of the opponents was a higher void, then things would start to go awry.</p><p>Moreover…</p><p>There were one Cutting Path Stage, two higher voids and one Demi-Saint!</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>On the Abyss Island, the celestial heavens split open and dark clouds gathered.</p><p>Everyone noticed this strange phenomenon.</p><p>This was because the Heaven and Earth Phenomenon this time was even more terrifying than the fluctuations from the previous three Saint Calamity.</p><p>“Again?”</p><p>“Who is about to transcend the tribulation this time?”</p><p>“How powerful! What kind of power! This Saint Calamity must be the Holy Emperor’s Calamity… Ugh! Wait, what is this?”</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators on the Abyss Island who were still alive looked up at the same time. They were shocked to see three eerie, enormous eyeballs that emerged from the rift in the sky.</p><p>It filled the entire sky!</p><p>Each of the three eye balls had three blood-colored flowers. The Yin and Yang aura swirled about and disaster threatened.</p><p>It was as if the Master of the Thunder Calamity was shocked by the shocking fluctuations this time. He stuck his head out and wanted to see which Saint was about to transcend the tribulation here!</p><p>“Gulp!”</p><p>Countless people were shocked and became speechless.</p><p>They had seen this ‘transcend the tribulation’ before.</p><p>However, during this ‘transcend the tribulation’, there were three pupils that descended and portents of disaster appeared in the sky.</p><p>What did this mean?</p><p>Very soon, they understood what this meant.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The first Thunder Calamity condensed.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The second and third Thunder Calamity condensed.</p><p>“Boom boom boom boom…”</p><p>A total of ten Thunder Calamity suddenly appeared.</p><p>The entire Outer Island of the Abyss Island was covered by dark clouds. The First Hall of Sins and other extreme grounds were not enveloped in the gaze of the three blood-colored flowers embedded in the Nine Heavens.</p><p>“He…”</p><p>“How powerful?”</p><p>Some people were envious.</p><p>The repeated Saint Calamity fluctuations had completely stimulated everyone.</p><p>The Saint Ascension is so frequent. Anyone can come, why can’t I?</p><p>“What kind of foundational roots of Saint Ascension was that? It could allow a ten-person expedition team to transcend the tribulation at the same time?”</p><p>“Brothers, charge! It’s in this direction!”</p><p>“It’s on a first come, first serve basis!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
