His telepathic communication drifted over.</p><p>“Don’t move!”</p><p>The first reaction of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was not to protect himself, but to shake off the vampire on his back. She was unconscious due to the Possession.</p><p>Then, he directed his Three Loathsome Eyes at Ye Xiao’s immobile body and gave it a violent jolt. The right half of his vision turned dark.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>… Break?</p><p>How could Ye Xiao interrupt the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s move?</p><p>The second true body’s heart almost jumped out of his throat.</p><p>The scythe of the God of Death did not slow down at all as it sliced through the body of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. It pierced through the sky above Mu Zixi, who had fallen to the ground, and disappeared on the other side.</p><p>“Sob…”</p><p>Mu Zixi finally woke up. She rubbed her eyes and looked confused. “What just flew over?”</p><p>The battlefield was deathly silent.</p><p>In the sky, the owl eye of the God of Death finally shattered.</p><p>Along with it, the orange robe on the upper body of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man disappeared.</p><p>Although it was a spiritual attack, the excessive damage that overflowed only caused the upper part of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s robe to be torn apart. Only a few strips of cloth fluttered limply on the orange hem.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>A cracking sound could be heard.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s orange mask cracked open. The upper half hung on the bridge of his nose without moving. The lower half was also affected by the power of the God of Death and shattered instantly.</p><p>His lower jaw, including the exposed upper half of his body, turned black in an instant because the same part of his soul had been slashed by the scythe of the God of Death.</p><p>All the black flesh and blood on his body were filled with an extremely dense aura of death.</p><p>In the void, Xu Xiaoshou’s second true body, whose eyes were imbued with the Ghost Inscription, looked at the scene.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s soul body seemed to have been hooked out of his physical body by the scythe of the God of Death. It had been cut in half and had broken off in midair.</p><p>“They’re all dead…?”</p><p>The soul body of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had been cut in half and it no longer moved.</p><p>Ye Xiao had exhausted the power of the God of Death. In the end, it was unknown if it had been cut off by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man through the Three Loathsome Eyes. In any case, it did not move.</p><p>“They died together?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even dare to imagine such an ending!</p><p>But now, it seemed that it had really happened?</p><p>“Old Xu, should I take little junior sister away now?” The second true body seemed a bit intoxicated, so now he didn’t dare to act rashly now.</p><p>“Wait a moment. Let’s wait for a while…” Ye Xiao did not move, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man didn’t move, and Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to move either.</p><p>He just waited.</p><p>One breath…</p><p>Two breaths…</p><p>Three breaths…</p><p>“Tsk!”</p><p>Something unexpected happened.</p><p>Star spots suddenly appeared between the two halves of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s soul body, like a broken lotus root.</p><p>In the next second, a large amount of black mist rose from between his two souls. It was not fast, but it repaired his soul body bit by bit and pulled it back into the physical body of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>“Ghost Beast power!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou and the second true body exclaimed in unison.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man had the power of a Ghost Beast?</p><p>This guy’s Body of Decay was so disgusting. He even had the Three Loathsome Eyes and the Mind-Changing Aperture. Forget about that, but he was also involved with Ghost Beasts?</p><p>It was impossible for Yama to cooperate with the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>Did this mean that they had secretly colluded with Xu Yue Gray Palace to study the power of the Ghost Beast?</p><p>Or was the Five Decays of Heaven and Man… an exception?</p><p>No matter what, Xu Xiaoshou was terrified and did not dare to reveal his second true body.</p><p>It was only because he was so curious this time that he had asked his second true body to follow him that he was able to see such a secret.</p><p>Otherwise, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had hidden such a secret when he cooperated with him to kill Ye Xiao. He did not know when he would reveal it and trick him!</p><p>“All dead?”</p><p>When Mu Zixi woke up, she felt as comfortable as if she had slept all day.</p><p>Moreover, the enemy had stopped moving. Was this a good thing or what?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou came and killed everyone?</p><p>When she saw that Ye Xiao and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man were not moving, she walked over with a suspicious expression. She frowned and extended her finger and wanted to poke them.</p><p>“Don’t move!”</p><p>The second true body was scared to death.</p><p>D*mmit, this is not fun!</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man used the power of the Ghost Beast to repair his remnant soul. How dare you still act so rashly?</p><p>When Mu Zixi heard this telepathic communication, she really did not move.</p><p>Her feet seemed to be filled with lead and she stopped immediately. Her little fingers did not even curl back. She maintained her posture and her eyes widened. She instantly turned into a wooden puppet.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>At this moment, the little girl’s eyes lit up. She felt that dawn had finally broken in the First Hall of Sins. The holy light engulfed her body and left nothing for Ye Xiao and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man</p><p>“Wow…”</p><p>“Brother Xu, you’re finally here. Did you know that I almost died?”</p><p>Bean-sized tears rolled from her eyes. Mu Zixi pursed her lips and cried loudly in her heart, but she remained motionless.</p><p>Whatever Xu Xiaoshou promised, he would do it!</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>With a painful groan, after the restoration by the Ghost Beast’s power, the remnant soul of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man finally managed to reemerge and return to its body.</p><p>He was not proficient in the Dao of the soul, so when his soul left his body, his thoughts stopped.</p><p>The images in his mind stopped at the moment when Ye Xiao was controlled and Mu Zixi was thrown to the ground. He would not die just yet.</p><p>As soon as the soul returned to his body, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man rushed towards Ye Xiao. He completely forgot the fact that the puppet behind him had already woken up.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou watched from afar. He did not know what the Five Decays of Heaven and Man wanted to do. He was so focused that he did not even deal with the small threat behind him.</p><p>However, he knew that perhaps this was the reason why he sent his second true body to follow the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man stood in front of Ye Xiao.</p><p>He could not open his right eye for the time being.</p><p>However, Ye Xiao had already been controlled before the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was hit by the scythe of the God of Death.</p><p>At this moment, there was a little spiritual source left in the body of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. The Three Loathsome Eyes was maintained by this power source.</p><p>Although she couldn’t open her eyes, the three gray flowers in Ye Xiao’s eyes hadn’t faded.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man had won.</p><p>This naturally meant that Ye Xiao had lost everything!</p><p>“The first question…”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man spoke.</p><p>His voice was calm; there was no joy in it even after he won such a big battle.</p><p>Even if he now controlled Ye Xiao’s main body, the respected Dark Division Chief of the Holy Divine Palace and the true ruler of the underground world, the God of Death!</p><p>“How far have you cultivated the Body of Death? How far are you from the Immortal Body?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
