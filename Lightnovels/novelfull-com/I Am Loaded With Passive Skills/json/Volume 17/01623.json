(3)</h1><p>1623 Ten Crippled Sword Ghosts, The Brutal Combat Strength of the Past Era! (3)</p><p>“Sword Demon?”</p><p>“Who are you, kid? How can you summon the Sword Demon?!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could hear the distinct tremor in his voice. It was fear!</p><p>This fear was not the sporadic kind. It was the type of fear that had been suppressed to the extreme, but it was almost endless when released.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The Sword Demon’s head tilted to the side, and a crisp sound of cracking bones could be heard.</p><p>Its head had not been cut off by the sword that pierced through the top of its head, but the look in its eyes became unhappy, extremely unhappy!</p><p>“I hate being interrupted when I’m talking.”</p><p>This sentence was uttered with its back to Elder Han and its body bent toward Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>However Xu Xiaoshou could clearly feel that when the Sword Demon said this, its attention was no longer on him, but on the returning Elder Han.</p><p>Ta.</p><p>The Sword Demon took a step back, and Xu Xiaoshou felt the sky brighten a little. The afterimage in front of him had also turned into fragments.</p><p>Elder Han was shocked.</p><p>This kind of speed…</p><p>Elder Han hurriedly lowered his body and spread out the two bat-like wings on his back to protect himself.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The Sword Demon was like a phantom. When it appeared in front of Elder Han, it had already slashed down heavily from the sky with one hand.</p><p>Elder Han suddenly spread his wings and tried his best to deflect the blow from the sword.</p><p>In the end, the strength of the Sword Demon’s attack had once again exceeded his expectations!</p><p>With a ‘Sizzle’ sound, Elder Han’s wings were cut off on the spot. The long sword that protruded from the Sword Demon’s palm tore open a bloody wound on his shoulder.</p><p>“F*ck you!”</p><p>Elder Han was furious. He transformed into his Ghost Beast form that was as huge as the sky.</p><p>This size seemed to be extremely oppressive to ordinary people. However, Elder Han’s movements were already slower than the Sword Demon’s. Now that he had grown even larger, he could not even sense the Sword Demon’s movements.</p><p>The Sword Demon snorted and swung its forearms downward and hit the two thin swords that were inserted diagonally under its ribs.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>The two thin swords sliced through the flesh on the Sword Demon’s body. At the same time that Elder Han increased his size, they had already cut through the space; they turned into two decapitating sharp weapons that were aimed at Elder Han’s head.</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>Elder Han went berserk.</p><p>His speed was second to none among the Demi-Saint Ghost Beast, yet he could not even keep up with one-ten-thousandth of the Sword Demon’s speed. How was he supposed to fight?</p><p>He had just expanded in size, but now he had no choice. He had to shrink his size immediately to avoid being decapitated by the two swords!</p><p>Not only was the Sword Demon fast, but the power of its slashes was also top-notch. Elder Han wasn’t confident that he could block the Sword Demon’s attack with his thin neck, as his shoulder had just been injured.</p><p>“Dumb pig!”</p><p>Elder Han transformed back into his human form and a mocking laugh drifted into his ears.</p><p>In the next second, the top of his head was shrouded in darkness.</p><p>The ferocious Sword Demon had appeared in front of him at some point in time. Its body had shrunk to a size similar to his and then it opened his arms and gave Elder Han a tight hug.</p><p>At that moment, Elder Han’s face turned green!</p><p>The Sword Demon’s embrace was not something that a normal person would dare to enjoy.</p><p>There were ten swords inserted into its body. Who could withstand the sharpness of such a hug?</p><p>“Get the hell off me… Go away!”</p><p>A thick ice armor condensed on Elder Han’s body. He swung his limbs outward and intended to blast the Sword Demon away.</p><p>When the Demi-Saint’s Power was fully released, the sky and earth were completely frozen at this moment, and frost overflowed.</p><p>However, this still could not stop the Sword Demon’s actions!</p><p>The ferocious Sword Demon emitted a sinister laugh. Then it gently hugged Elder Han.</p><p>At that moment, the world fell silent.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyelids twitched.</p><p>Gu Qingyi gritted his teeth.</p><p>Gu Qinger suddenly wrapped his arms around his chest and closed his eyes tightly. It was as if he recalled a nightmare.</p><p>“Sizzle! Sizzle!”</p><p>These first few sounds were from the Sword Demon as it hooked its feet. The broken sword stuck between its knees sliced through Elder Han’s calves like tofu.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The pain struck and Elder Han screamed in agony. His face turned pale and he seemed to suffer from unbearable pain.</p><p>“Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle!”</p><p>The latter sounds came from the Sword Demon’s chest. The three swords that had pierced through its back and chest suddenly pierced through Elder Han’s ice armor and penetrated into the right, middle, and left side of his chest where his heart was.</p><p>“Pfft…”</p><p>Elder Han lost the ability to scream and his eyes were unfocused.</p><p>He was a Demi-Saint, but he had been taken down by the Sword Demon with just a few strikes. He had been tortured so badly that he couldn’t even move.</p><p>“Swish! Swish! Swish!”</p><p>The sound of wind rushing in the distance was initially faint and then became louder and louder. Elder Han seemed to have thought of something and as he turned back, his pupils trembled.</p><p>The three onlookers turned their heads at the same time and looked up.</p><p>The two thin swords the Sword Demon had thrown out from under its ribs that had not decapitated Elder Han flew back like bones in flight.</p><p>“Sizzle! Sizzle!”</p><p>These two sounds were that of the thin swords’ return to the body of Sword Demon, to its ribs.</p><p>Of course, Elder Han, who was being hugged by the Sword Demon in front of its chest, was the first to take the brunt of the sword sheathing damage for the Sword Demon.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>Elder Han spat out a large mouthful of blood, which splattered onto the Sword Demon’s shoulder.</p><p>The Sword Demon’s left hand, that only had three fingers, gently held Elder Han’s body. It raised its right hand high up, and in its palm was a sharp broken sword that had protruded out of its flesh.</p><p>“Wait…”</p><p>“Stop… stop…”</p><p>The Sword Demon’s sword seemed to have some sort of special ability.</p><p>Even though Elder Han was a Demi-Saint, he was extremely weak after being stabbed by the seven swords.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
