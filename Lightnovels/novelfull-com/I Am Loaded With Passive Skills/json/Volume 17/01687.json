(2)</h1><p>1687 Crazy Half-Saint, Three Tribulation Eyes, Buried Together! (2)</p><p>“Your original body brought the other two Demi-Saint Incarnations to the Abyss Island. Now that Master Siren has killed one of you, there is still one left.”</p><p>“Your Lei Family’s Eyes hasn’t been revealed even at the point of your death… So, that Demi-Saint Incarnation is your last resort and contained all your tricks?”</p><p>“Then I understand. So your plan was to completely abandon and sacrifice your main body. You would banish it to the Inner Island if the situation worsened and you couldn’t get the exemption order.”</p><p>“At that time, at the cost of losing part of your cultivation level, you can turn the Demi-Saint Incarnation into your new body. There won’t any limit to the countdown to exile then, right?”</p><p>Huang Quan did this analysis, then he smiled and pinched Jiang Buyi’s chin, as he stared into his eyes. “So, will you still turn up? That Demi-Saint Incarnation?”</p><p>Mei Siren’s eyes swept over the unsealed Shang Xuan sword on Huang Quan’s back. He said seriously, “If you analyze it this way, his Demi-Saint Incarnation won’t come unless he is ill.”</p><p>Huang Quan was speechless.</p><p>Even if his spiritual source was scattered, he could still summon the River of Time and use his Holy Blood as a sacrifice to replace his past peak state with his current self.</p><p>He had the second of the nine supreme divine weapons on his back!</p><p>After a battle, other than the Holy Blood, he could almost always maintain his peak condition.</p><p>If he became a Saint, he wouldn’t even need to use the Holy Blood.</p><p>How should he fight?</p><p>Even Mei Siren didn’t want to fight with Huang Quan. He was an almost impossible monster to kill.</p><p>Jiang Buyi must have been kicked in the head by a donkey. That’s why he would send his Demi-Saint incarnation over to die, right?</p><p>Huang Quan disagreed. He turned to Mei Siren and smiled.</p><p>“But don’t forget, Master Siren, he signed a Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree contract with Yu Lingdi.”</p><p>“And the last order Yu Lingdi gave him was to take him away.”</p><p>Huang Quan shook Jiang Buyi’s limp and powerless head and scoffed, “In his current state, can he still take Yu Lingdi away?”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s heart clenched.</p><p>He seemed to have understood something.</p><p>Huang Quan lifted Jiang Buyi’s corpse with one hand and threw it into his own space time. Then, he turned to look at Yu Lingdi.</p><p>“Young and promising.”</p><p>“But now, if I take you down, Jiang Buyi will look for me soon, won’t he?”</p><p>Weng!</p><p>Zhen Huang Palace became ablaze with lights. The entire venue seemed to be completely controlled by Yu Lingdi and the water was dense.</p><p>“Deep Sea!”</p><p>With a loud boom, the sky became like a hole. Water poured down and filled the entire space of Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>Both Huang Quan and Mei Siren were drenched in Yu Lingdi’s pure water barrier.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s hands moved swiftly as he ignored the consumption and continued to form seals.</p><p>“Reverse Devouring Prison!”</p><p>He joined his palms together.</p><p>At the same time, a spherical water prison formed around Huang Quan and Mei Siren.</p><p>Chi chi!</p><p>Absorption of spiritual energy.</p><p>Mei Siren and Huang Quan felt their life force and spiritual energy being sucked out at an extremely fast speed. As for Yu Lingdi, his face started to turn red.</p><p>At some point, Huang Quan even dreamed of the Lone Cliff in the deep sea.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s Water-type Upanishad ability was actually very similar to the water ball created by Water Ghost in the deep sea!</p><p>But…</p><p>It was too weak!</p><p>“Is that all?”</p><p>Huang Quan crooked his finger. The void cracked with an ear splitting sound.</p><p>The terrifying suction force from the black hole in the spatial rift instantly sucked out more than half of the Deep Sea World in Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>At the same time, it was as if Huang Quan was in a second dimension. With a light step, he crossed the spherical water prison around him.</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>Mei Siren also shifted the heavy objects easily away. He partially hid his body and used a small trick from the Swordless Sword Technique and disappeared from the water prison.</p><p>Huang Quan was amused.</p><p>“Zhen Huang Palace does not have a Spell Forbidden Barrier!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s face was deathly pale.</p><p>Of course, he didn’t have the confidence to fight against Huang Quan and Mei Siren on his own.</p><p>His Water-type Upanishad was strong, and it could kill an ordinary higher void.</p><p>However, for the ordinary higher void and the peak higher void and the peak higher void and Mei Siren and Huang Quan – how many layers separated these two names?</p><p>The difference between clouds and mud was not even enough to describe it!</p><p>Therefore, from the very start, Yu Lingdi never thought of using his spiritual technique to severely injure… no, to even slightly injure the two people opposite him.</p><p>All he could think of was to restrain himself and make a quick escape.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>The water-type Power Upanishad Formation flashed with light.</p><p>A second ago, Yu Lingdi’s form was still in the great hall.</p><p>In the next second, ripples flowed, and his body had already flowed into the great array of Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>He crossed the great array, transformed into his original form and fled desperately!</p><p>“Heh.”</p><p>Huang Quan was amused.</p><p>If he managed to escape, he would write his name backwards.</p><p>He raised his sleeves slightly.</p><p>However, he sensed that Mei Siren had suddenly disappeared from his surroundings. After he activated the Swordless Sword Technique, this person had decided not to reveal his true form.</p><p>Huang Quan sensed something and lowered his hand.</p><p>“Perfect morality.”</p><p>As expected, a warm voice filled with enlightenment suddenly floated down from the void.</p><p>“Water user.”</p><p>“Bound for the east, not stopping for anyone…”</p><p>“A man without a palm, but the Dao exists…”</p><p>“Droughts and floods are orderly, sacrifices are useless…”</p><p>Yu Lingdi, who had fled suddenly felt a ferocious monster jump into his mind.</p><p>His left hand held the lesson plan and his right hand held the pointer.</p><p>He trampled on Yama and thousands of swords bowed above his head.</p><p>As soon as he entered, he smacked Yu Lingdi’s head without any explanation and began to brainwash him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
