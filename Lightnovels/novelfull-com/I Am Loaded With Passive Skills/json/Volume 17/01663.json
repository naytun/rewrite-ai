(6)</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s water-type Clone had been tortured to pieces, but his things were still at the arena.</p><p>“Don’t think about it.”</p><p>At this moment, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had already reached the secondary plane door. He stretched out his hand and directly passed through this illuminated gate illusion.</p><p>“As expected, it’s just an illusion of the secondary plane door…”</p><p>“Even if Yu Lingdi obtained the secondary plane door, it wouldn’t be of much use to him.”</p><p>“The secondary plane door needs to be activated by Holy Power. Only Demi-Saints can do that and it will cost a lot.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was deep in thought. “What about this illusion?”</p><p>“He only borrowed some of the power of the secondary plane door and used only a little for the distorted space. If Ye Xiao had really been saved by him, she probably wouldn’t be sent to the Inner Island, but back to the main body of the secondary plane door.”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man did not even raise his head as he began to clean up the battlefield.</p><p>He dipped his finger into a drop of blackened blood and picked up a black feather from the side. Finally, he took out a dagger and cut off a piece of flesh from his heart that had turned black due to his soul being incomplete.</p><p>“What does he want to do?”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also narrowed his eyes.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man didn’t pay attention to these two people and started to move, one step at a time.</p><p>After he picked up the items and cut off his flesh, he took out a table from his spatial ring, three incense sticks, and three cups, and arranged them carefully.</p><p>Then, he took out a dirty black ox bone wine pot and poured wine into the cup.</p><p>Through his Perception, Xu Xiaoshou could see that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man Decay was being very careful; he poured out one drop of wine at a time.</p><p>When the wine was poured into the cup, it did not even cover a tenth of it, only the bottom of the cup was filled.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man placed the black blood, owl feather, and black flesh between the three wine cups.</p><p>Xu Xiashou’s eyelids twitched rapidly.</p><p>“What are you trying to do?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but ask.</p><p>However, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man only glanced at him casually before he looked away. He pressed his palms together and burned some incense.</p><p>Mu Zixi’s ears twitched.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s Perception was activated. He felt that he couldn’t hear anything, but he tried his best to listen.</p><p>As he listened, he reached out from behind and covered Mu Zixi’s ears tightly.</p><p>Mu Zixi looked up and glared at her Senior Brother. You can listen, but I can’t, right?</p><p>“+(Cursed. Passive Points +) 1, +1, +1, +1… ”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man muttered some incomprehensible incantations.</p><p>Soon, his expression became agitated. His eyes glowed with a green light. He grabbed the first cup of wine and poured it down the altar.</p><p>“The first cup – may the body never be strong.”</p><p>Sizzle! Xu Xiaoshou who understood the content, felt his hair stand on end.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man moved rapidly. The second cup was refilled and he sprinkled the wine.</p><p>“The second cup – may your bones fry, may depression and loneliness dominate your life.”</p><p>What was he doing?</p><p>Was he invoking a curse?</p><p>This guy’s ability was a little too disgusting!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had always been cursed and had never been afraid, panicked for the first time, when he heard the curses.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man quickly filled the third cup and scattered the contents of the cup into the sky.</p><p>“The third cup – may you be plagued by restless souls.”</p><p>“+(Startled, Passive Points,+) +1.”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man Decay’s hands stretched out and slammed onto the altar. He shouted,</p><p>“Three cups of sacrificial wine, may you imbibe and die an early death!.”</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>He waved his hand.</p><p>The altar and the items on it exploded into a mist of blood-red light of curses. With a Swish, it flew into the horizon and disappeared from sight.</p><p>The direction…</p><p>The direction of Zhen Huang Palace?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart pounded wildly. He pulled his little junior sister and took a step back. He asked loudly, “What are you doing? Did you just place a curse on Ye Xiao?”</p><p>After the Five Decays of Heaven and Man finished the ritual, he finally looked up.</p><p>His gaze first landed on Xu Xiaoshou, then on Mu Zixi. After a long pause, he looked into the distance and grinned.</p><p>“How can my prey escape?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
