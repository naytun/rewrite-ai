Broken arms, torn flesh, bones… There were a wide array of items.</p><p>“The Swordsman, a gentleman among soldiers, upright in all directions, inherited the Dao and stopped the fate, the authority of the Heavens…”</p><p>In the main hall, the sound of singing drifted out.</p><p>Outside the hall, dozens of Void Attendants pushed and shoved each other. Some only had their upper bodies, some only had their heads left, and some had their heads but their limbs were missing.</p><p>Yet even with such severe injuries, the Void Attendants were still alive.</p><p>They followed the old voice in the great hall and one by one, they opened their mouths and roared.</p><p>“Roar, roar roar…”</p><p>When the uneven roars finally stopped, an amiable enlightened voice came from the main hall again.</p><p>“Those who practice the sword should prioritize propriety and fear. They should not violate the rules with the sword, nor should they make the sword their immediate desires…”</p><p>“Roar, roar, roar…”</p><p>“The sheathed sword is the main ceremony. Sacrifice is the first. The sacrificial ceremony can be made known to the world, to allow people to distinguish right from wrong and distinguish between black and white… The same goes for the Void Attendant.”</p><p>“Roar, roar, roar…”</p><p>The Void Attendants were clearly tired.</p><p>This kind of torture lasted for too long. Some could not take it anymore and fell asleep.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>At this moment, a sword light slashed out from the great hall. It split the sleeping head into two. Black blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>A light flashed in the Abandoned Dimension Hall. Not only did the Void Attendant whose head had been split into two not die, but its wounds also healed rapidly. After it woke up, its battered body trembled and it opened its mouth to shout.</p><p>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”</p><p>The other Void Attendants trembled and began to wail loudly.</p><p>“Roar, roar, roar…”</p><p>“Boohoo.”</p><p>The more daring Void Attendant looked up and saw a human Elder. He sat on the stone statue in the main hall.</p><p>This person’s clothes were tattered and covered in black blood, but his face was kind and benevolent.</p><p>He gently fanned himself with the paper fan in his right hand. His gaze fell on the ancient book in his hand, and he patiently turned the Abandoned Dimension Hall into a school. He forcefully trained a group of immortal Void Attendants into obedient students.</p><p>This torment lasted for more than half a day.</p><p>The youthful sound of enlightenment did not repeat its sentences; it did not stop for a moment and continued throughout.</p><p>At a certain moment, the space around the Abandoned Dimension Hall changed and underwent a Transformation.</p><p>Amid the folds of lights and shadows, a golden figure emerged from the void. He wore a golden mask and had a saber and a sword stabbed into his back.</p><p>As soon as he entered, he was stunned by the peaceful scene in the Abandoned Dimension Hall and the pungent smell of blood.</p><p>After a long time, the uninvited guest who had barged into the school shook his head and clapped. He sighed and said, “Master Siren… How marvelous. I have seen and heard a lot today!”</p><p>In the main hall, Mei Siren who sat on the stone statue looked up at the newcomer.</p><p>“Yama, Huang Quan?”</p><p>Without a doubt, this masked man in the gold robe was the Yama Chief Huang Quan.</p><p>Mei Siren didn’t believe that like him, he had been teleported here due to the abnormal space movement and couldn’t leave this place filled with its strange laws.</p><p>It was obvious that Huang Quan came for him.</p><p>“What is it?” he asked bluntly.</p><p>“Sorry to disturb your mood, Master Siren. However, aren’t you worried about your disciple’s safety and your own life if you waste time here?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s image flashed across Mei Siren’s mind, but he shook his head gently.</p><p>“This old man has tens of thousands of disciples. I do not understand who Lord Huang Quan is referring to. However, no matter what, it is useless to worry if we cannot leave this Abandoned Dimension Hall… Are you here to learn the sword?”</p><p>“No need.” Huang Quan waved his hand. “It seems that Master Siren is not good at the Fantasy Sword Technique His comprehension of space is not enough to break the rules of the Abandoned Dimension Hall?”</p><p>“I am slow by nature.”</p><p>“Master Siren, this is…” Huang Quan pointed at the orderly Void Attendant fragments below and couldn’t help but ask curiously.</p><p>“The rules of the Abandoned Dimension Hall are special. The Void Attendant can’t be killed so it’ll just be a waste of time to attack again. Would it not be better that we sit down and discuss the Dao together? We’ll learn from each other’s strengths.” Mei Siren wasn’t stingy with his explanation.</p><p>Huang Quan was silent for a while and no longer bothered about this strange matter. He changed the subject and said, “I can help you leave this Abandoned Dimension Hall and regain your freedom.”</p><p>“What’s the condition.” Mei Siren didn’t even bat an eyelid.</p><p>“I’ll help you to deal with the countdown, your time should be running out.” Huang Quan casually threw out a command token.</p><p>Mei Siren closed the fan to block, then opened it to take a look.</p><p>It was a black command token covered in mysterious engravings. In the middle of the token was the word ‘Death’ that had been crossed out diagonally.</p><p>Death Exemption Token?</p><p>Was this what Xu Xiaoshou was talking about?</p><p>“This is the Death Exemption Token. Stick it on your forehead and it will cancel the death countdown in your mind. After that, Master Siren can move freely.” Huang Quan showed 120% of goodwill.</p><p>Mei Siren frowned. He looked away from the Death Exemption Token and looked at Huang Quan.”How did you know that I have a countdown timer in my mind?”</p><p>Huang Quan spread out his hands with a smile in his yes.</p><p>“I know everything I need to know!”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking.</p><p>The void buzzed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
