(4)</p><p>Demi-Saint Jiang’s full-powered attack was not weakened by Huang Quan’s defense at all!</p><p>“Demi-saint’s Power is shocking.”</p><p>Huang Quan was still laughing!</p><p>Just as the 3,000 Dao Worlds was about to be shattered, he patted his chest, and a drop of golden Holy Blood spurted out from his lips under the mask.</p><p>Huang Quan put his palms together and used four fingers on his chest to sacrifice one drop of the golden Holy Blood into the void.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The power of the Holy Blood was instantly swallowed by him.</p><p>Huang Quan opened his mouth and his voice sounded ethereal and indistinct.</p><p>“Time Reversal!”</p><p>Ka!</p><p>The ‘time’ gear began to spin in reverse under the power of the Holy Blood.</p><p>Huang Quan’s soul fate trajectory under the blood-colored Thunder Calamity, was also distorted and returned to its right track.</p><p>As the light flickered, everyone felt that everything had blurred, as if they had experienced something, but also as if…</p><p>They had not experienced anything?</p><p>“Get lost!! ”</p><p>Jiang Buyi watched as Huang Quan slowly walked over from the side and was about to take the exemption order from his forehead. Finally, he could not bear it anymore and his eyes seemed about to split open.</p><p>He decided to ignore the countdown to exile and make a move.</p><p>If this wave could kill Huang Quan, even if the countdown of three days was reset to zero.</p><p>As long as he could get the exemption order from Yu Lingdi, he could avoid the fate of being exiled.</p><p>Therefore, he activated the energy reserve of Holy Power and was about to release his Sacred Physique.</p><p>However, in the next second, he seemed to have woken up and decisively stopped his actions.</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>It wasn’t a whim!</p><p>Was this a memory?</p><p>Wasn’t this what had just taken place?</p><p>Jiang Buyi was dumbfounded. He had already attacked once, but Huang Quan had distorted the time and he was now back to the state before he attacked?</p><p>He still recalled that it was because of the Demi-Saint…</p><p>The others…</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s saint’s will swept over. As expected, Yu Lingdi and Mei Siren were slightly startled. It was obvious that they had yet to fully react to what had just happened.</p><p>“Ta.”</p><p>At this moment, Huang Quan had successfully grabbed the Exemption Order and pulled it out from the bloodied arm on Jiang Buyi’s forehead.</p><p>“Are you forcing me to make a move?!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi finally realized something and despair arose in his heart.</p><p>He looked at the countdown to exile in his mind. There was only one day left!</p><p>Time had been reversed, but it was a fact that he had made a move once. The countdown to exile had recorded that!</p><p>So, Huang Quan’s plan was to force him, Jiang Buyi, to make a move. This would then clear the remaining time on the countdown to exile?</p><p>Was that why he walked so slowly, to give him enough time to think and decide what move to take?</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s eyes widened in anger.</p><p>He did not expect the time attribute to be so strange.</p><p>It was obvious that he had been played for a fool. Only now did he realize this.</p><p>Huang Quan laughed.</p><p>He held the exemption order in his hand. Even if he was next to Jiang Buyi, this fierce tiger, he was not afraid. Instead, he seemed to look forward to his second attack.</p><p>“How can we be hasty, when it comes to a fight with a Demi-Saint?”</p><p>“Demi-Saint Jiang, why were you so anxious?”</p><p>“Didn’t I tell you? My plan is to use the Abyss Island’s spatial exile power to kill you the moment you were banished! ”</p><p>When he heard that mocking tone that garnered so much hatred, Jiang Buyi wanted to let go of all his scruples and just kill off Huang Quan in the Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>But…</p><p>“Pa!”</p><p>He did not move.</p><p>Huang Quan smiled as he squeezed the Exemption Order between his fingertips.</p><p>“No”</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Buyi’s eyes dimmed.</p><p>Even Zhen Huang Palace seemed to have turned completely dark.</p><p>“Countdown to exile: One day! ”</p><p>This eye-catching ‘one day’ filled all the blank spaces in Jiang Buyi’s mind at this moment. It was like a heavy hammer that was about to fall and made one’s heart and lungs suffocate.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>However, in the next second, the shattered exemption order turned into golden water and seeped into Huang Quan’s fingertip!</p><p>The water-type Power Upanishad Formation in Zhen Huang Palace disappeared.</p><p>A second water-type Power Upanishad Formation appeared at Huang Quan’s feet!</p><p>This Transformation was something that even Huang Quan himself had not expected.</p><p>His attention was centered on Jiang Buyi. He seemed to provoke him casually, but in reality, he was on high alert all the time.</p><p>After all, this was a Demi-Saint who could kill him if he was not careful!</p><p>Who would have thought that he would fall into the trap of another little fellow present.</p><p>As his pupils constricted, Huang Quan subconsciously took a step back and said, “Time…”</p><p>But at the same time, another voice came out of his mouth.</p><p>“Scattering Swamp Spirit!”</p><p>With two bangs, two bloody hands extended from Huang Quan’s arms and quickly formed a seal on his chest. Then, they ruthlessly struck his energy center.</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>Spiritual mist spread out.</p><p>As soon as the seal was formed, Huang Quan was shocked to find that all the spiritual source in his body had dissipated through the pores on his body.</p><p>Not a single bit was left!</p><p>It turned into spiritual mist that lingered in Zhen Huang Palace!</p><p>“What move is this?”</p><p>In terms of Spatial Upanishad, Huang Quan could still rely on his own space attributes to figure out a thing or two about this ability. He would then be able to restrict Ye Xiaotian’s movements.</p><p>However, this Water-type Upanishad was different.</p><p>Never would Huang Quan have thought that a Cutting Path Stage junior would do something so nauseating!</p><p>He had just been parasitized by the water swamp, and all the spiritual source in his energy reserve had been scattered. How could he continue to fight?</p><p>How could a Spiritual Cultivator who had lost his spiritual source fight against a Demi-Saint? How could he fight against a Water-type Upanishad?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
