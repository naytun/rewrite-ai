He quickly connected back and looked at the golden water droplet.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>When the black lightning fell, an illusory shadow flew up from the golden water droplet and instantly flew to the top of Ye Xiao’s head, standing between her and the black lightning.</p><p>“Secondary plane door, open!”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even know what he had heard!</p><p>As his pupils trembled, he saw an illuminated gate open above Ye Xiao’s head.</p><p>It was a dark and weak light…</p><p>On one side, the distorted scenes of the various extreme grounds on Abyss Island flickered.</p><p>One side was very blurry, reflecting some scenes that people wanted to see clearly and see through, but could never see through.</p><p>The secondary plane door!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally realized the key point of what he had just said.</p><p>The secondary plane door that someone had exchanged for a day ago had appeared here in Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>It flew out from the golden water droplet.</p><p>Jiang Buyi exchanged for it?</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou instantly denied his thoughts.</p><p>This voice…</p><p>It was Yu Lingdi!</p><p>“Brother Chen, be careful of Yu Lingdi.”</p><p>Gu Qingyi’s last words sounded so heavy when he thought about it.</p><p>So, the water stains in the Zhen Huang Palace were really left behind by the Yu Lingdi?</p><p>The secondary plane door was also something he exchanged for by borrowing the power of the Holy Divine Palace to continuously sneak into the Abyss Island and collect Void Crystals.</p><p>But why…</p><p>Jiang Buyi was carrying the secondary plane door?</p><p>He did not know that he had a secondary plane door on him. When he ran away from the Arena, he threw it away.</p><p>“F*ck…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had thought of 10,000 possibilities. Jiang Buyi might have left behind a demi-saint supreme treasure or his demi-saint incarnation.</p><p>However, he would never have thought that the golden water droplet left behind by Jiang Buyi contained the sound of Yu Lingdi and a secondary plane door!</p><p>Was he an idiot?</p><p>He threw away the only key to becoming the master of Abyss Island, but he took away 50 pieces of Void Trash to exchange for a Death Exemption Token.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The black saint calamity landed on the secondary plane door above Ye Xiao’s head, but it did not pass through the secondary plane door and hit Ye Xiao.</p><p>On the contrary, the saint calamity disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Once they passed it, they would become Saints. Once it started, even demi-saint Elder Han would have to run away and not dare to reveal any aura.</p><p>Under the influence of the secondary plane door, there was not even a fart ripple.</p><p>Gone?</p><p>“This tribulation has been transferred from the Outer Island of the Abyss Island to the Inner Island?” Xu Xiaoshou and his second true body remembered something.</p><p>At the same time, the second true body turned its head.</p><p>However, he saw that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man also turned to look at him.</p><p>The two of them met eyes and saw through each other’s thoughts almost at the same time, “Do you really want to take it?”</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man did not even want Mu Zixi. The Decay Qi shook the second true body and turned around to pounce on Ye Xiao’s head.</p><p>He had never expected that the door would suddenly cook itself and then send it to his mouth.</p><p>And it was from Jiang Buyi’s backup plan that no one had expected!</p><p>What was going on today?</p><p>As long as other people had bad luck, would he be able to turn it into good luck?</p><p>“Space, freeze.”</p><p>Before the Five Decays of Heaven and Man could fly far, a voice came from behind.</p><p>In an instant, the lightning in the Nine Heavens remained unmoved, but all the transformations in the battle were frozen. Apart from the secondary plane door, which was still flickering with light and shadow.</p><p>Even the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and the Ye Xiao that was transcending the tribulation stopped all movements.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The second true body brushed past him and passed by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. At the same time, his gaze was filled with determination.</p><p>“I can give up my life for the secondary plane door, but can you?”</p><p>“My d*mn true self!”</p><p>With this order, the second true body fearlessly charged toward the door. It reached out with both hands, wanting to grab the illusory treasure worth 10,000 Void Crystals.</p><p>“Plop…”</p><p>Suddenly, rain fell from the sky.</p><p>From the hairiness to the downpour, it only took less than half a breath!</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>With the golden droplet as the center, a huge water-type Power Upanishad Formation that even the Arena would find difficult to swallow spread out from the ground.</p><p>At this moment, it was so dazzling!</p><p>The light reflected by the water-type Power Upanishad Formation reflected all the figures in the air that could not move.</p><p>The second true body felt his brain stop thinking.</p><p>When he returned to his senses, he realized that his body had withered like rotten wood through his “Perception.”</p><p>All the moisture in his body was sucked out of his body.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>At the same time, the Nine Heavens Thunder Calamity rumbled again, and another thick black lightning descended.</p><p>The second true body lost all mobility, but its body pounced on top of Ye Xiao due to inertia.</p><p>However, he brushed past the secondary plane door.</p><p>The secondary plane door tilted!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
