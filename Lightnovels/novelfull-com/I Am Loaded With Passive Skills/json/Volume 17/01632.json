(4)</p><p>“Since I told you to eat, just eat it! Why are you talking so much nonsense? If I wanted to kill you, would I need poison? I could just let you go out and take a walk, and you might be caught by that person and slashed with a sword!”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Elder Han felt a little wronged, but he didn’t dare to refute it either. He just held the Holy Medicine and started eating.</p><p>His eating method was very cautious, like a rabbit nibbling on grass. He pushed the medicine into his mouth bit by bit, but his speed was not slow either. Soon, he finished nibbling on the Holy Medicine.</p><p>The transformation was obvious.</p><p>Almost visibly, the various sword scars on his body were healed. His essence and spirit seemed to have recovered to their peak state. His charred black hair regained its luster, and he was no longer in the miserable state he had been after being struck by the saint calamity.</p><p>Elder Han could even feel the flesh and blood on his severed arm growing rapidly. However, due power of fate in the Cang Godhood Sword, the recovery speed was very slow.</p><p>“Here,” It was as if Elder Han had returned to the Inner Island of the Abyss Island. Once there was someone better than him, he would stop thinking. As such, he raised his severed arm for Chen Tan to see.</p><p>“Settle it yourself,” The corners of Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth twitched as he stared at the wound on the other party’s severed arm. If Elder Han still couldn’t deal with the power of fate with the help of Holy Medicine, then he decided not to accept trash.</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Elder Han waved his hand, and the frosty white air surged wildly under the nourishment of the Holy Medicine. Soon, the power of fate was broken, and his arm grew back.</p><p>Wasn’t he very capable?!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his anger surge again.</p><p>If it was something he could solve by himself, wasn’t he brainless to have given him his severed arm?</p><p>“What’s next?” Elder Han asked.</p><p>He could feel that Chen Tan’s attitude towards him was different. If it was still the same as before, how could the latter give him the Holy Medicine?</p><p>To think this fellow had Holy Medicine and could even give it out casually…</p><p>Elder Han gulped. He felt that the person that Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison asked him to find was not Xu Xiaoshou, but Chen Tan!</p><p>“I want you as a subordinate,” Xu Xiaoshou pondered for a while before saying.</p><p>With a bang, Elder Han knelt on one knee and bowed, ” I… Eh, this lowly one will obey your every command. From today onwards, I will listen to Bazhun’an and will no longer be subjected to Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison… umm, that bastard. I only listen to…”</p><p>“Stop flattering others. What I said was that I want you as a subordinate!” Xu Xiaoshou’s tone became more serious.</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>He wasn’t stupid. It was just that compared to someone with a dirty heart, he seemed purer. Therefore, how could he not understand what Chen Tan meant?</p><p>However, Elder Han would never acknowledge such a young man.</p><p>He had knelt twice, but the ones he was kneeling to were the Master of the black and white veins Bazhun’an, as well as the hidden Bosses behind Chen Tan, and not Chen Tan himself.</p><p>Chen Tan was just a young man. Let alone a demi-saint, even ordinary higher void-level experts would not follow his lead.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the person kneeling before him and said calmly, “The person that the Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison wants you to find is not Xu Xiaoshou, but me, Chen Tan! Xu Xiaoshou is just a pig pushed to the forefront by the Saint Servants. Under the watchful eyes of the Holy Divine Palace and other Bosses, he will be finished sooner or later. I’m different. I’m the one and only Bazhun’an has been secretly nurturing, the only one with the Four Pillars of Destiny Token.”</p><p>Elder Han stared at Chen Tan in a daze and thought to himself, “You’re bullshitting!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the Frost World that was coated with green power. He took a deep breath and spread out his left hand. Infernal white flames immediately rose from it.</p><p>“This is…” Elder Han’s pupils constricted.</p><p>“The person Great Infernal Ancestor is betting on is actually me.”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou spoke, he flipped his right hand upward, and the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch appeared.</p><p>“This!” Elder Han’s pupils trembled.</p><p>“The person that Seven Trees Emperor is betting on isn’t Xu Xiaoshou, but me as well.”</p><p>Then, he curled his palms and put away the fire and the branch. Following that, he took out the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale.</p><p>“Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, the only master of the Black Vein, is also betting on me. My name is Chen Tan. Xu Xiaoshou is just a pretense.”</p><p>“???” At this moment, Elder Han’s mind was blank.</p><p>He couldn’t understand what was happening, but he was shocked.</p><p>These abilities and these things were not something that could be casually displayed or faked.</p><p>Without the approval of the Holy Emperor’s will, let alone holding the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale, one would probably die on the spot if one even touched it!</p><p>“I…”</p><p>“Do you want to live?” Xu Xiaoshou calmly interrupted Elder Han.</p><p>“W-what do you mean?” Elder Han was completely stunned, unable to come back to his senses.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his head, and his gaze seemed to pass through the Frost World that was coated with the Holy Emperor power of Lord Qing Shi from the Divine Prison.</p><p>At this moment, he felt as if he had returned to the Tiansang Spirit Palace, to the Goose Lake, and to that night…</p><p>That night, he had eaten the world’s biggest pie, and he had also obtained the “Qiu Long Words”. To this day, Elder Sang often disturbed his sleep, coming in the form of nightmares.</p><p>“What is this?” Xu Xiaoshou pointed at the void and then at the ground.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>This was an idiot… Xu Xiaoshou simply went on, “This is the Abyss Island. What else can you tell from the Abyss Island?”</p><p>“W-what?”</p><p>Sigh, this was really hard… Xu Xiaoshou could only answer his own question and justify his words by asking again,” Have you played chess before?”</p><p>“Ye… Yes…”</p><p>“The Abyss Island is like a chess game, and you are one of the chess pieces. With your demi-saint ability, you might be able to charge around and be the “rook”. But you have to know that other chess players are watching this game of chess, and there are also other chess pieces. Once the path of the “rook” is blocked and you are in a dilemma, what will you do?”</p><p>“Wha… What?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
