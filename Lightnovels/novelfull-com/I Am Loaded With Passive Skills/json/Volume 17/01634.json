(1)</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was ambitious.</p><p>However, when he was in such an insignificant position, he admitted that his ambition did not yield any good results. At most, he would be seen as ‘biting off more than he could chew’ and be suppressed.</p><p>It was different now.</p><p>When the Demi-Saint Ghost Beast Elder Han, bowed to him and swore that he would only be loyal to Chen Tan for the rest of his life; he would not listen to anyone else, not even Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison or Bazhun’an…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t describe his feelings.</p><p>“I, have to take action…”</p><p>After he endured this for such a long time, Xu Xiaoshou carefully executed his little plan amid the chaotic situation. Now, he felt that finally there were signs that he was about to become famous.</p><p>The First Pavilion of Deva was just an attempt. He got to know Master Siren and also received help from Momo and Xin Gugu.</p><p>Of the latter two, one represented the faction of the Black Vein of the Inner Island of the Abyss Island. When you set everything aside, these four words ‘Holy Emperor Fengtian’ represented everything.</p><p>Behind Xin Gugu was Greedy the Cat Spirit and the Xu Yue Gray Palace. This was a super faction that Xu Xiaoshou wanted to get in touch with but didn’t dare to do so yet.</p><p>Even if most of them were allies created when he borrowed the power of Bazhun’an.</p><p>But if Bazhun’an used Xu Xiaoshou, why then did Xu Xiaoshou not use Bazhun’an?</p><p>Every time he encountered a major change and was about to lose control of the situation, he only needed to pull out Bazhun’an and the attention of all the faction would shift.</p><p>When the First Pavilion in the Sky first appeared, how many investigations had they encountered? Xu Xiaoshou was well aware of this!</p><p>However, each time the investigation of the Holy Divine Palace had not yet been concluded, the problems that plagued Dongtianwang City appeared, one after another. Each of their problem seemed to be bigger than those of the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>As a result, Rao Yaoyao had no choice but to set aside a large number of operations against The First Pavilion in the Sky. She had to pay attention to the truly important matters that took place.</p><p>It was under such circumstances that Xu Xiaoshou completed his initial attempt.</p><p>The First Pavilion in the Sky had been established!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was too ambitious, so ambitious that he didn’t dare to speak out.</p><p>After he became a Saint Servant, Bazhun’an did not restrict his freedom and allowed him to do as he pleased.</p><p>Under such circumstances, what Xu Xiaoshou wanted to do was not to follow the Saint Servant’s orders and blend in. This could be seen from the way he did things.</p><p>What he wanted was to rely on the Saint Servant’s power and establish a faction that belonged solely to him!</p><p>The reason being if these fetters were formed when he was weak, it would be difficult for him to work alone.</p><p>When everyone fought openly or secretly, they suddenly saw that there was a building that stood out in the big picture. Moreover, it was already unattainable and they had no choice but to pay attention to it.</p><p>At this time, he would use the relationship he had built earlier to negotiate and trade.</p><p>No one would ever look down on you again.</p><p>No one can swallow you or the First Pavilion in the Sky!</p><p>This idea was very presumptuous and seemed impossible to attain. However, after he traveled from Dongtianwang City to the Abyss Island, Xu Xiaoshou had already stabilized the matter.</p><p>Perhaps even Bazhun’an didn’t know that one of his Saint Servant, who was only at the Master Stage, if he needed help, could already get help from three of those already at the Demi-Saint Stage.</p><p>Mei Siren, Void General Hong, and Elder Han who had just surrendered!</p><p>Feng Yujiin, Xu Yue Gray Palace, and others were not mentioned. Xu Xiaoshou would not do anything that he was not sure of.</p><p>What he wanted was someone who could turn against Bazhun’an with a mere flip of his hand. He didn’t want someone who even after he received an order, would be torn between the Saint Servant and the First Pavilion of Deva. Eventually he would side with the Saint Servant.</p><p>Of course, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t find any reason that showed the differences he and Bazhun’an had, so he wasn’t stupid enough to challenge him now.</p><p>It’s good to enjoy the shade under a big tree.</p><p>The First Pavilion in the Sky could only thrive as long as the Saint Servant did not fall. Who would be stupid enough to bring down their own backer?</p><p>Everything was just his conventional thoughts from the worst-case scenario.</p><p>“Get up.”</p><p>After he helped Elder Han up, Xu Xiaoshou looked at him with a smile. He suddenly felt that Elder Han was even cuter now.</p><p>This guy was a menace. If he accepted him, he would have to face Rao Yaoyao on his behalf. But if he didn’t accept him, did that mean he didn’t have to face her?</p><p>However, Elder Han was not Elder Han, but another Demi-Saint with a distinct personality and his own ideas.</p><p>Perhaps he wouldn’t be able to accept it, and he might not even have the chance to!</p><p>Such a stupid and cute Demi-Saint. If he didn’t take him in now, would he had left him to fend for himself?</p><p>“From now on, you have to revert to your original appearance.”</p><p>“Be as arrogant as you can be, be as savage as you can be, and call me whatever you want. But don’t show any reverence, fear, or other emotions toward me.”</p><p>“We can’t expose our relationship to outsiders. Do you understand what I mean?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Elder Han as if he wanted open up the Three Loathsome Eyes to brainwash him. His eyes seared into him.</p><p>“Understood.” Elder Han nodded.</p><p>“Your ‘understood’ is not clear enough.”</p><p>“Eh?” Elder Han was taken aback, but soon, a mocking look appeared in his eyes. He waved his hand and said, “I understand. Do you have anything else to say?”</p><p>“That’s right!” Xu Xiaoshou nodded in satisfaction.</p><p>“Then the two outside…” Elder Han shrank back and indicated the two people with the surname Gu outside the Frost World.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glared coldly at him.</p><p>“Ji!” Elder Han immediately screamed and said impudently, “What about those two over there? What are they doing? Are they entitled to know? Are they your people too?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
