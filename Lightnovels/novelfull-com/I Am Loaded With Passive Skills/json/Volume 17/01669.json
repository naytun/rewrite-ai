I’m jealous…”</p><p>“Are there really that many foundational roots of Saint Ascension? Why can’t I get a chance to do it even once?”</p><p>The ignorant were still amazed by the three waves of Saint Ascension fluctuations in such a short period of time, just like Mu Zixi.</p><p>The little girl looked up at the darkness of First Hall of Sins with a sense of foreboding; it was as if she was the only one who had sensed it.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, this is the third Saint Ascension fluctuation!”</p><p>“How terrifying! This place…”</p><p>In the end, she seemed to have recalled something. She glanced at the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, who was still picking up some unknown trash on the battlefield.</p><p>“What about your curse? When will it take effect?”</p><p>She really wanted Ye Xiao to die.</p><p>She was the Chief of the six divisions and had a close relationship with Yi.</p><p>If she didn’t get rid of this person soon, she might be her next target.</p><p>The ones who were aware about this Saint Calamity were Xu Xiaoshou and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even bother to answer his junior sister’s question.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was in an amicable mood. He turned around and glanced at her. “So, why do you think there’s a third Saint Calamity?”</p><p>Mu Zixi was stunned.</p><p>Only then did she realize that this red Saint Calamity that was different from the previous black Saint Calamity, might… be from the cursed Ye Xiao?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I think we have to look for something that might have dropped here.” The little girl looked at the Five Decays of Heaven and Man who was busy picking up the trash. Her face turned pale, and her eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>The ability of this Five Decays of Heaven and Man was too terrifying!</p><p>When he picked up stuff from the ground, he could start his curses and even curse people to undergo the Saint Calamity?</p><p>Wasn’t he worried about the consequences after the other party really transcended the tribulation?</p><p>It was simply impossible to cross it.</p><p>Ye Xiao wasn’t even a semi-saint person. She had said it herself.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at his junior sister and said in surprise, “Are you here to teach me how to do things?”</p><p>Mu Zixi choked and glared at her Senior Brother fiercely. She muttered, “So you’ve already checked. As expected of you.”</p><p>“+(Cursed, Passive Points +) +1, +1, +1 +1… ”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not in the mood to pay attention to this string of curses.</p><p>He looked at the Five Decays of Heaven and Man who was about to leave after he packed up. He could not help but ask, “Where do you plan to go?”</p><p>“Why?” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man turned his head, and his eyes were filled with anticipation. “Do you want to leave with me, or do you want to give your junior sister to me now?”</p><p>“Impossible!” Xu Xiaoshou shook his head decisively. “If we’re in a cooperation, then I need to know where you’re headed for and what you want to do. That way…”</p><p>After a pause, he thought of an excuse. “Yes, so that I can cooperate with you later.”</p><p>The corners of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man twitched as he smiled silently.</p><p>“Ghost City of the Netherworld.”</p><p>“If you need me, come and look for me at any time.”</p><p>He didn’t hide the facts at all!</p><p>He did not even know if this was a smokescreen to hide his true whereabouts…</p><p>However, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was very serious. In the end, his gaze was still fixed on Mu Zixi.</p><p>“You too.”</p><p>“If you’ve thought it through, you can come and find me at any time. Even if you have no other choice, that’s fine.”</p><p>“After all…”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man spread his hands.</p><p>“We can never grow under the wings of others, can we?”</p><p>“Mu Zixi, you and I are on the same path, the lurker of the night!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered for a moment, then turned around and left with his junior sister.</p><p>I really can’t talk too much to the Five Decays of Heaven and Man! The more he spoke, the more he seemed to be a human trafficker!</p><p>Whether it was abduction or face-to face confrontation…</p><p>However, at this moment, a resistance force came from her.</p><p>Mu Zixi suddenly turned her head. Her expression was solemn, and she didn’t seem to be joking.</p><p>“How should I find you?”</p><p>It was a cold female voice!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils trembled.</p><p>No way, Lei Xi’er?</p><p>Lei Xi’er was influenced?</p><p>She didn’t seem to be an irrational person.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>“Get lost and go back to sleep!”</p><p>Mu Zixi scratched her head, her face filled with hate. Her tone changed and she slapped herself hard.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was clearly shocked by these two voices.</p><p>He frowned and thought for a moment. He probably didn’t expect that this God Devil Eyes’ host would be so easily moved.</p><p>But this was a good thing!</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man looked intently at Mu Zixi, and finally turned to look at Xu Xiaoshou. He sneered and said.</p><p>“Soon, when the time comes…”</p><p>“If you are in trouble, call my name… The Five Decays of Heaven and Man!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man didn’t stay any longer. After he said that, his body exploded into a gray-black mist and he flew toward the weak spot in space and escaped to the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>He remained in a dazed state for a long time before he reacted. He turned around and clamped his hand tightly on little junior sister’s shoulder.</p><p>“Lei Xi’er, are you crazy?”</p><p>“Ouch! It’s me now…”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s face scrunched up in pain. She wanted to say something, but her expression suddenly calmed down.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you should know that I have to do whatever I can.”</p><p>“The Five Decays of Heaven and Man is filthy, but I will definitely be the same. What he said is indeed true. I am like him. I should be a person who walks in the dark.”</p><p>“Shut up!” Little junior sister finally spoke up and clamped down the other cold female voice that she deeply detested.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s lips and teeth chattered.</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s voice sounded again. “You know better than me that you can’t protect me… and her all the time.”</p><p>“Ah!” Mu Zixi suddenly covered her head and shouted, “Ah… ah… Eh?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
