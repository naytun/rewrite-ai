(1)</p><p>“The time attribute was indeed disgusting…”</p><p>The moment he pushed open the wooden door, Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have experienced the feeling of being separated from his body and mind.</p><p>The Time Ancestor Shadow Staff in his hand emitted a faint light.</p><p>Soon, the feeling of separation disappeared.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou regained control of his body.</p><p>As the saying goes, difficult the first time but easy the second.</p><p>When he walked into the wooden attic again, his fear was much reduced. At least Xu Xiaoshou was no longer flustered and at a loss.</p><p>He could maintain his calm and think.</p><p>Unlike the last time, he only wanted to leave as soon as possible.</p><p>Of course, this feeling of “peace of mind” was not entirely because this was the second time Xu Xiaoshou had stepped into the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion.</p><p>There were even more…</p><p>Well, it should be said that there was a 99% chance that it was because there was a familiar person sitting beside the small wooden table in the middle of the wooden attic!</p><p>“You’re here?”</p><p>Bazhun’an looked over, pushed the wine pot to the opposite side, and waved his hand.</p><p>“From your expression, it shouldn’t be your first time here?”</p><p>“How was it? I forgot about this paradise. How did it feel the first time I came here?”</p><p>Even though he had expected this, Xu Xiaoshou still felt like it was an illusion when he saw Bazhun’an sitting in the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion.</p><p>Every time they met, he could feel the fear of outsiders and his own strength from his experiences.</p><p>The sense of legend did not weaken with time and intimacy. Instead, it grew with each passing day.</p><p>“In short, it doesn’t feel good,” Xu Xiaoshou said hesitantly.</p><p>He glanced at Kong Yuhen, the gentle and smiling young scholar opposite Bazhun’an, and still felt that he must be a wolf in sheep’s clothing!</p><p>He walked away.</p><p>Two of the Ten High Nobles were waiting by the wooden table.</p><p>It seemed like they had been waiting for a long time. They had already chatted and drank a round.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt honored.</p><p>Even so, he was neither fast nor slow.</p><p>From what he could see with “Perception”, the furnishings of the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion were the same as the last time he came.</p><p>On the left was a table, but the dust on it had been washed clean. There were some wooden carvings placed neatly.</p><p>There were all sorts of things, combs, wooden clocks, roulette… Of course, the most eye-catching thing was the small wooden carvings of the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>There were two of them right in front of him. Comparing them, they were amazing!</p><p>“How could this wooden carving of Kong Yuhen look just like the appearance of the scholar Kong Yuhen… Hmm? What does the little wooden sculpture of Kong Yuhen look like again?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried to compare the image of the little wooden carving with the real one in front of him. Then, he removed his delicate disguise and visualized his ferocious side.</p><p>However, he realized that once his attention shifted, he could not remember Kong Yuhen’s face clearly.</p><p>Moreover…</p><p>“I obviously can’t remember this scholar’s face, but I did imitate him in the First Hall of Sins, and I succeeded!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of something and conjured Chen Ruye’s face again, turning to the Bazhun’an.</p><p>“Who do you think I look like?”</p><p>Bazhun’an held his cup and laughed.</p><p>He immediately understood what Xu Xiaoshou was thinking. He said, “There’s no need to imitate it. Your imitation doesn’t look like anything at all.”</p><p>“What is it? So I just casually pinched a face that I thought was his?”</p><p>In front of Bazhun’an, Xu Xiaoshou was much more unrestrained. He did not hide the fact that he had wanted to use the Imitator Kong Yuhen to slander this guy.</p><p>“You want to imitate me?” Kong Yuhen smiled and looked over.</p><p>Sizzle! Xu Xiaoshou’s hair stood on end. He shrunk his head resentfully and hurriedly waved his hand. “It’s nothing. Don’t talk nonsense…”</p><p>“Am I that scary?” Scholar Kong Yuhen rubbed his nose and turned towards Bazhun’an.</p><p>Bazhun’an laughed loudly, and their expressions turned solemn as they nodded.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“To them.”</p><p>So you’re not afraid at all… Xu Xiaoshou muttered in his heart as he looked at the wooden ladder on the rightmost side.</p><p>Last time, Kong Yuhen had come down from the second floor.</p><p>He did not know that up there…</p><p>“You want to go up?”</p><p>Kong Yuhen looked at him with an understanding gaze again. It was obvious that he understood Xu Xiaoshou’s intentions. His face was warm and gentle.</p><p>“Uhh.”</p><p>Was there anything worse than disguising great evil as good?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou blinked and retracted his gaze. He waved his hand again. “It’s nothing. Don’t talk nonsense…”</p><p>Kong Yuhen frowned.</p><p>“Friend…”</p><p>“Yes, I’m very anxious!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already learned to answer first. “You don’t have to deliberately bring it up. It will only make me more anxious and won’t alleviate my anxiety at all.”</p><p>Kong Yuhen suddenly narrowed his eyes and lowered his voice like a phantom whispering. “How do you know that I’m trying to ease your anxiety?”</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face turned pale on the spot. He was stunned on the spot and could not move at all.</p><p>He had already cast “Acalanātha” and “Vanishing Technique”.</p><p>As for “take the easy way out”… Forget it. Playing this in front of the ancestor of the space type was equivalent to walking into a trap willingly.</p><p>As long as there was a need, Xu Xiaoshou would immediately enter the Yuan Mansion and let his second true body come out to use his awakened skills.</p><p>He did not know if it would work.</p><p>However, the one who died would definitely not be the main body!</p><p>“So you have to speak like this before you can have a real reaction…” Kong Yuhen pondered.</p><p>He suddenly sighed again, and his face was filled with worry as he turned to Bazhun’an. “Friend, he can’t relax at all. He’s too anxious. ”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
