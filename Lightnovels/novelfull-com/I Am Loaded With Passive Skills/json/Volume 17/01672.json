Do You Know Bazhun’an?(4)</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Red calamity clouds hovered above the Nine Heavens.</p><p>The fluctuation from the Saint Calamity spread across the entire Abyss Island. From time to time, a bolt of lightning would strike an area in the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>When he looked up, the center of the Saint Calamity seemed very far away from him…</p><p>If it was the first time for one to see the aftermath of the Saint Calamity, they would be shocked and terrified.</p><p>However, after he saw it countless times, Xu Xiaoshou was no longer surprised.</p><p>“Let’s leave this place first. We’ll talk about where we should go to. Everyone is breaking through. I have to seek a breakthrough too.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou walked away and chose a direction to flee to.</p><p>He didn’t know what he had to escape from, but the further he fled, the better.</p><p>“Breakthrough?”</p><p>Mu Zixi carried the little ferret and quickly caught up. Her eyes lit up. “Xu Xiaoshou, you’re about to break through to the Sovereign Dao Realm?”</p><p>“Yes, I should have broken through to the Sovereign Stage a long time ago. It’s just that there’s this death countdown, so I didn’t dare to break through. Now that I’m more relaxed, there are already signs that I can’t suppress it any longer.”</p><p>“I think it’s better to endure it first?” Mu Zixi thought about how strong Xu Xiaoshou was now. How powerful would he be if he broke through to the Sovereign Dao Realm?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rolled his eyes silently.</p><p>If he endured any longer, he might really die!</p><p>A minor Master Stage had to face monsters time and again.</p><p>In the past, fights with those at the Sovereign Stage and Cutting Path Stage felt ridiculous, but after that, it felt natural to fight with the higher void level.</p><p>Now that they had entered the Abyss Island, their enemies had already attained the Demi-Saint level!</p><p>Fortunately, he did not have to do anything. If he was involved in a normal battle, he really did not know how his life would end up.</p><p>High-end games were not easy to play!</p><p>He had to take advantage of the fact that the Demi-Saint had just begun to show up. He had to seize the time to break through to the Sovereign Stage. Perhaps he would be involved in it at a later so that his life would be saved.</p><p>However…</p><p>“Where should I go to break through to the Sovereign Stage? Where would the risk be lower?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou began to think as he flew away from the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>His thoughts were always clear and would not be affected by external factors. It was the same even if the situation was totally chaotic elsewhere.</p><p>However, his own rhythm could never be messed up.</p><p>If he messed up and rushed into the battle, he would die on the spot!</p><p>“Oh right, how long did it take you to break through to the Sovereign Stage?” Xu Xiaoshou turned around and asked.</p><p>Mu Zixi was stunned. “Me, when I awoke, I was already at the Sovereign Stage. Have you forgotten?”</p><p>The corners of Xu Xiaoshou’s lips twitched.</p><p>Damn it…</p><p>“Elder Han, do you know how long it usually takes to break through to the Sovereign Stage? I heard that it takes a long time to comprehend the Great Path?” Xu Xiaoshou decided to ask from a normal point of view.</p><p>“Ah?” Elder Han was also stunned. He hesitated and replied, “According to what you humans say, I’m a primordial Saint Beast. I was born into the Sovereign Dao Realm. I seemed to have been struck by lightning during my growth, and then I became a higher void. So, I can’t answer your question.”</p><p>The corners of Xu Xiaoshou’s lips twitched again.</p><p>So annoying!</p><p>Am I the only one who needs to consider how to break through to the Sovereign Stage? Do I have to bother people with my question?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath and gave up trying to exchange ideas.</p><p>Why wasn’t there a normal person around him?</p><p>In truth, he could have directly entered the Yuan Mansion to seek a breakthrough.</p><p>However, the Sovereign Dao Realm was different from the breakthrough of the Innate Stage and Master Stage. The comprehension of the Way of the Heavens was the most important. Xu Xiaoshou had already understood this long ago.</p><p>When the Yuan Mansion was just created, the Order of the Great Path was still incomplete.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was worried that an accident might occur when he broke through inside.</p><p>The rules of the Abyss Island seemed to be different from those of the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>However, since even Rao Yaoyao dared to become a Saint here, it meant that the rules here were at least complete. In theory, it shouldn’t be a problem for him to break through to the Sovereign Dao Realm.</p><p>However, the Abyss Island was full of danger. If he sat down, it would take three to five days for him to break through.</p><p>If a Void Attendant or Rao Yaoyao were to appear when he was half way through, that would not be good, right?</p><p>“I need a guardian to protect me…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at Elder Han.</p><p>Demi-Saint Elder Han was the best protector.</p><p>However, he was now almost equivalent to being Rao Yaoyao’s bait. He would be able to lure Rao Yaoyao over at some point.</p><p>It would be better to split up into two groups instead of using Elder Han as a protector.</p><p>At the very least, he would not break through halfway and then run into Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>“Pah!”</p><p>He took out his communicator and thought of an excellent protector However, if he really used him, it seemed a little overboard…</p><p>He injected his spiritual source.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s imagination started to run wild as he tried to contact Bazhun’an.</p><p>“Hmm, at this time, Bazhun’an should have entered the Arena, right? Perhaps he is nearby now?”</p><p>“If Bazhun’an could be my guardian, then I will definitely be safe, right? Perhaps I can even cultivate into some special bounded domain…”</p><p>“That’s right. Whatever he wants to do in the end, it has to be confirmed. We can’t always be led by the nose.”</p><p>“Very good, I’ll just use this excuse to contact him. The breakthrough of the guardian is just incidental. It is not considered a favor. I’m helping him, so he should thank me instead.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou flew along as he waited eagerly for a response.</p><p>The communicator maintained its usual busy tone.</p><p>Other than the incident at the Spirit Gem Trade Fair, Xu Xiaoshou had successfully contacted Bazhun’an only once.</p><p>After that, he did not contact this elusive, always missing, and omnipresent fellow.</p><p>Therefore, he did not know if his wishful thinking would succeed this time.</p><p>Just say that you agree…</p><p>Hopefully!</p><p>“What did you do?” Mu Zixi looked at him curiously.</p><p>“Called for help.” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even turn his head.</p><p>“Who did you call? Why? Aren’t you going to break through to the Sovereign Stage?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
