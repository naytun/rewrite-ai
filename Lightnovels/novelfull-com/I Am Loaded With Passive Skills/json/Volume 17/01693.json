(1)</p><p>Deng Deng Deng.</p><p>The cup trembled slightly, and the tribulation qi seeped through the building.</p><p>Bazhun’an smiled and slapped Xu Xiaoshou into the breakthrough stage, before he sat down.</p><p>What followed was a faint aura of calamity that rose from all directions.</p><p>“Transcend the tribulation?”</p><p>This was too much of a coincidence!</p><p>It was such a coincidence that even Kong Yuhen thought that Xu Xiaoshou did not break through to the Sovereign Dao Realm, but to the Cutting Path Stage of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity.</p><p>Very soon, he realized that something was wrong.</p><p>This tribulation aura was not only at the level of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity, but even the Saint Calamity was difficult to describe.</p><p>“Saint Ascension?”</p><p>Kong Yuhen glanced at Xu Xiaoshou in surprise, then his gaze froze and he looked out the window.</p><p>Bazhun’an felt the same way. He almost thought that Xu Xiaoshou was ahead of him in the Saint Ascension, but then he realized that something was wrong in the next second.</p><p>“It’s not that he has gone through the Saint Ascension. Someone is going through the Saint Calamity outside.”</p><p>“What kind of Saint Calamity is this?”</p><p>Even Bazhun’an had never come into contact with such a powerful Saint Calamity.</p><p>Since when did the Abyss Island have such a person? The power of this Demi-Saint was close to that of the Holy Emperor?</p><p>Kong Yuhen didn’t say anything. He swiped his hand in the air, and the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion almost turned transparent.</p><p>Someone who sat high up there could see the sky.</p><p>There were three blood flower pupils embedded in the Nine Heavens. It was as if the God of Calamity gazed at the Abyss Island and cast a look of disaster upon it.</p><p>Under his gaze, ten Thunder Calamity overlapped in the direction of the First Hall of Sins. The pressure created was not only destructive, but it was also powerful enough to shatter a corner of the Abyss Island.</p><p>“Three Tribulation Eyes…”</p><p>Bazhun’an narrowed his eyes and was in deep thought.</p><p>He recognized this pair of Lei Family’s Eyes. It was somewhat intriguing that someone had used it on the Abyss Island. Its appearance was totally unexpected.</p><p>Bazhun’an held his cup and remained silent for a long time.</p><p>“Don’t you need to go over?” Kong Yuhen asked, unmoved.</p><p>He did not really care.</p><p>For a person who only wanted to find his own answers, it did not matter whether the surrounding environment was the scene of an apocalypse or one that was prosperous and serene.</p><p>None of these was a threat to the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion.</p><p>Since it was not a threat, he wouldn’t be anxious when he was in the building.</p><p>This was also the reason why Bazhun’an could sit in the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion and spend so much time in conversation with Xu Xiaoshou in front of Kong Yuhen.</p><p>Kong Yuhen this person whom he he thought was ‘not of this era’ would not interfere with the actions of the Holy Divine Palace, the Saint Servant and the rest of the faction.</p><p>He only had one ultimate goal, and that was to find the answer that belonged to him.</p><p>Those who didn’t understand Kong Yuhen’s intentions would naturally feel that his actions were strange and erratic.</p><p>Those who understood were like Bazhun’an; they only felt that there were traces to follow and there would not be any unnecessary worries.</p><p>“No need.” Bazhun’an stared at the three strange pupils in the sky and shook his head. They looked very familiar, but at the same time also very unfamiliar.</p><p>“Are you not worried? Or is there something else?” Kong Yuhen asked.</p><p>Bazhun’an’s expression did not change. “The people I arranged have already entered the arena a long time ago.”</p><p>When Rao Yaoyao walked back into the First Hall of Sins with Number Two, she felt that things had changed.</p><p>The last time she appeared here, she had cut off the Ghost Beast Elder Han’s sealing barrier with a single sword strike. She had used the pressure it gave her and made a decision to become a Saint.</p><p>This time, she was still the same person, but one had to add the word “Saint’.</p><p>As the Ruler of the red-clothed people and a member of the ten-member council of the Holy Divine Palace, she was a powerful figure.</p><p>It could be said that even if everyone in the world believed in Bazhun’an’s Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict and believed that the Abyss Island was filled with the foundational roots of Saint Ascension, she Rao Yaoyao wouldn’t believe it.</p><p>However, she was the first person to become a Saint on the Abyss Island.</p><p>How should she put it?</p><p>Fate was playing tricks on people!</p><p>“Becoming a Saint also has its troubles…”</p><p>The countdown to exile in her mind had never appeared before she became a Saint.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao thought of this and shook her head with a smile.</p><p>There were indeed too many things that she had not accomplished.</p><p>But no matter what, it was a success.</p><p>The Saint Ascension was also something that could not be ignored!</p><p>Number Two’s words were merciless, but he was right.</p><p>The most important thing now was to exchange the 50 Void Crystals in her ring for an exemption order.</p><p>It was easy to locate Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had already obtained the diagram of the internal structure of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>As for the walls of the labyrinth, even a Sword Deity could not stop it, let alone a Sword Saint.</p><p>Soon, Rao Yaoyao stopped in her tracks and arrived in front of the so-called ‘ruins’ of Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>She was stunned.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>This place, it can’t be the great hall, right?</p><p>She had personally seen a side hall like the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes once, and it didn’t look like this.</p><p>When she looked around, there was only a plaque that was only one-third in size. She could not verify that this was the great hall of Zhen Huang Palace because only the word ‘Palace’ was left.</p><p>The rest were all gravel!</p><p>There were three old men among the rubble. They were doing some kind of sticking ceremony and were in close proximity to each other. Their toes touched and it seemed they were exchanging kisses.</p><p>The oldest one had disheveled hair and had a disabled person with broken legs and arms on his shoulder.</p><p>They looked at each other.</p><p>With a loud bang, the First Hall of Sins exploded. Many types of Thunder Calamity appeared in the Nine Heavens.</p><p>“What’s going on…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was stunned.</p><p>She was only here to exchange for an exemption order, that was all.</p><p>Why was there such a good show here the minute she arrived?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
