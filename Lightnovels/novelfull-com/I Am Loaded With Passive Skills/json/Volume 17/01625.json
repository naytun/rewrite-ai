I was once part of the protectors and followed Bazhun’an for a period of time. He thought highly of me, so I knew that he had a Sword Demon that looked exactly like you. That’s why I recognized you.”</p><p>“Are you one of the Saint Servant?”</p><p>“Saint Servant? I don’t know anything about that… When I was with Bazhun’an, you weren’t even born yet! Saint Servant and whatever should be a matter of the future. At that time, we had already parted ways.”</p><p>“Then where did you go after that?”</p><p>“Xu Yue Grey Palace! I already said, don’t ask repeated questions!”</p><p>“Heh, how do you prove your identity?”</p><p>“Humph! I don’t have to prove it to you… Uh, okay, I’ll say it… I later joined the Xu Yue Grey Palace. According to your age, I should be one of the founding elder of the previous generation of the Xu Yue Gray Palace. It’s normal that you don’t know me.”</p><p>“Eldest Senior Brother, you can’t believe him. This is only a one-sided version of his story!”</p><p>“Aren’t you annoying… Uh, I’m sorry. Ask it to put down its sword first. We can talk things out. I do indeed have a companion. It was not a one-man show. If you are fated, you should have met another companion of your age who was with me at that time. His name was Chen Tan.”</p><p>Puff!</p><p>When he looked at the serious Elder Han in front of him, Xu Xiaoshou almost burst out laughing.</p><p>If he had been 70% skeptical about what he said previously, then when he said this, everything Elder Han said was pure nonsense. There was no credibility at all.</p><p>This guy’s ability to lie with his eyes open was simply perfect.</p><p>But if you say that you know Chen Tan…</p><p>The Chen Tan you mentioned is now standing silently behind you and staring at you!</p><p>Gu Qingyi and Gu Qinger also stopped asking questions and hesitated.</p><p>Not many people knew about creatures like the Sword Demon. While Elder Han was able to utter the name Bazhun’an and explain everything in a reasonable manner…</p><p>Gu Qingyi had some misgivings and did not dare to kill him.</p><p>Furthermore, the Sword Demon was indeed powerful. If it really wanted to kill him, Elder Han might have other trump cards to escape this deadly situation.</p><p>Don’t forget, the Demi-Saint Incarnation!</p><p>If that was the case, what followed would be endless revenge.</p><p>“Chen Tan…”</p><p>Gu Qingyi thought about this name and realized that he didn’t recognize it.</p><p>He recognized Chen Shu. He had been standing behind the three of them and the Sword Demon. From the beginning to the end of the battle, he had watched in a silent and calm manner.</p><p>“Brother Chen, what do you think?”</p><p>Gu Qingyi threw the ball into his court.</p><p>He still recalled that at the last moment, it was Brother Chen who said that he couldn’t kill Elder Han and that he would be of great use.</p><p>“Can you give him to me?” Xu Xiaoshou asked</p><p>“Of course, you can do whatever you want with him. I have nothing to do with him. You can kill him if you want.” Gu Qingyi extended his hand.</p><p>He really wanted to see the outcome because he had the Sword Demon and was fearless.</p><p>How did Brother Chen remain so calm even under the aura of a Demi-Saint?</p><p>Inside Zhen Huang Palace, the Sword Demon yawned in boredom. Everything seemed to be in order.</p><p>Gu Qingyi and Gu Qinger’s postures were relaxed. They showed no signs of being wary at all.</p><p>When Elder Han heard this, he also shifted his gaze from Gu Qingyi to the other young man at the back, with a polite expression.</p><p>He no longer dared to act recklessly. There was no trace of desire in his eyes for the Ghost Beast Host Body. It was as if he had never considered the possibility of using the Possession on any of the three people in front of it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled and glanced at Gu Qingyi. “I might need a private space to communicate.”</p><p>“Of course you can.” Gu Qingyi didn’t say a word and pulled his junior brother to leave. He didn’t reject his savior’s request at all.</p><p>“You don’t need to retreat. Just stay here. I’ll just have a one-on-one conversation with him.” Xu Xiaoshou stopped them.</p><p>Gu Qingyi was slightly startled. Then, he thought of something and nodded. “Be careful of his Possession.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Elder Han and gestured with his chin. “Let’s talk privately.”</p><p>Elder Han’s intelligent black eyes filled his adorable and well-behaved round face. He didn’t hesitate when he heard this and waved his hand.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The Holy Realm opened up and formed a Frost World that was isolated from the Sword Demon and the two Gu brothers.</p><p>At this moment, Zhen Huang Palace and the Frost World seemed to have become two different spaces. The inside could not be seen from the outside, and the outside could not be seen clearly from the inside.</p><p>“What do you want to say?”</p><p>It was only then that Elder Han seemed to have regained his sharpness and a fierce look flashed across his eyes.</p><p>If he really wanted to use his Possession now, the Sword Demon outside wouldn’t be able to stop him in time.</p><p>So what was this young man in front of him up to? He dared to put his life in his hands. Was he not afraid of death?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sized up the surrounding frosty environment and felt that it was bone-chilling. Even his thoughts were frozen and had slowed down.</p><p>It had to be said that Elder Han was completely defeated by the Sword Demon not because he was a noob; It was because he was currently in a weakened state, while the Sword Demon was in its prime.</p><p>If he really had to deal with anyone below the Dem-Saint realm, Elder Han could still kill them in an instant.</p><p>“Can this place of yours isolate the influence of the Holy Emperor’s will?” Xu Xiaoshou looked at the main character.</p><p>Elder Han frowned, clearly confused.</p><p>What was this young man trying to do?</p><p>“If you want to talk, then talk. There are so many trivial matters. Don’t tell me you want to use the Possession on me?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
