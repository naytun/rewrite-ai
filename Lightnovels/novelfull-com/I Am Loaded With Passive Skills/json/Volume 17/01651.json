That drop of golden water… Don’t forget Gu Qingyi’s reminder about Yu Lingdi.”</p><p>“Also, it’s impossible for the Five Decays of Heaven and Man to be so weak that he could be controlled by little junior sister for so long. The God Devil Eyes are no longer circulating. He must have a backup plan!”</p><p>“Ye Xiao has nowhere to go. What will she do? You are me, think about it yourself… Wait, there’s something wrong with her! She wants to use her Possession?”</p><p>“Don’t go out! There was no need to expose yourself! The Five Decays of Heaven and Man will not let Ye Xiao succeed… Ultimate Life Demon Physique, God Devil Eyes, and the power of the God of Death. He can’t even withstand it even if he’s a Saint. He can’t let Ye Xiao succeed!”</p><p>That’s your little junior sister, not mine… The second true body was frightened when he heard this. He now had a new perception of the main body’s ruthlessness.</p><p>I was so anxious that I almost rushed out. How can you still be so rational?</p><p>It was true that the commander-in-chief’s betrayal had chilled the second true body.</p><p>However, Mu Zixi’s actions were incomprehensible. Sometimes, she was quick-witted, and sometimes, she was plain stupid.</p><p>If even the second true body couldn’t predict what this little girl would do in the future, then the Five Decays of Heaven and Man probably couldn’t be controlled.</p><p>Since this unknown variable was here and no one could use it, he would let her derive the Transformation herself.</p><p>In any case, the betrayal of the commander was equivalent to joining the enemy camp. From another perspective, the enemy’s intelligence would be pulled down by one level.</p><p>But our side… It was different!</p><p>The two ‘officials’ were still there, and there were two of Xu Xiaoshou’s brains eyeing the same battle.</p><p>What the second true body couldn’t see, the main body could point it out in time and seamlessly transmit instructions to each other. It was simply an extremely meticulous battle calculation machine.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts finally settled down.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man moved about freely. It was the Three Loathsome Eyes that moved and targeted the main body of Ye Xiao-the three-legged black owl.</p><p>“Hold on a little longer. I’ll be there soon with two Demi-Saints. This d*mn labyrinth! ”</p><p>“My soul has returned!”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man felt that he was now in total control of the situation.</p><p>He used his own Life force to stall the God Devil Eyes.</p><p>The owner of the God Devil Eyes used it to stall Ye Xiao’s soul body.</p><p>All that remained was the empty shell of the Dark Division Chief.</p><p>The reason why the Three Loathsome Eyes was so strong was due to the Mind-Changing Aperture.</p><p>The reason why the Mind-Changing Aperture was so powerful was that as long as one paid a price, it could even control a corpse whose soul had perished.</p><p>Apart from that, Ye Xiao’s soul body had not died, but had only separated from her main body.</p><p>A statement : ‘The soul has returned’.</p><p>With the help of the bond between the physical body and the soul body, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man interrupted Ye Xiao’s intention to take Possession of Mu Zixi and forcefully pulled her soul body out.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s second true body had disappeared into the void with the help of the Ghost Inscription. He saw Ye Xiao’s soul body gradually being pulled out of little junior sister’s body with a horrified expression.</p><p>“Aww!”</p><p>At this moment, an owl screeched.</p><p>Ye Xiao was someone who had mastered the power of the God of Death How could her Dao of the soul be so weak?</p><p>Before she took action, she had already released the God of Death’s owl eyes.</p><p>The God of Death’s owl eye in the sky immediately under her guidance, directed its gaze at the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>“Soul Stripping Scythe!”</p><p>Ye Xiao’s backup plan that she had left behind before the Possession was finally activated.</p><p>The pupil of the God of Death’s owl eye, that was so large that it filled the entire battlefield’s background, suddenly split open in the middle. A huge black sleeve that was over a thousand feet long fell out.</p><p>It looked like a human arm, but it was too big!</p><p>What protruded from the black sleeve was not a body of flesh and blood, but a huge hand made of bones that held a black God of Death’s Scythe. The power of the God of Death was so dense that it condensed into liquid form.</p><p>The aura of death instantly filled the entire battlefield.</p><p>The Life force of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man suddenly seemed somewhat insufficient.</p><p>As soon as the God of Death’s hand appeared, his aura withered at a speed visible to the naked eye. His clothes and mask… For a moment, he lost all his spiritual light.</p><p>Even his soul seemed to be in an eternal slumber under the influence of the power of the God of Death.</p><p>“Interrupted!”</p><p>However, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was not in the least bothered. Even though the Three Loathsome Eyes in his right eye seemed about to pop out, he still desperately squeezed out the last bit of power from the Lei Family’s Eyes.</p><p>He was completely locked by the power of the God of Death and could not escape this attack at all.</p><p>The only way to save himself was to use the Three Loathsome Eyes and Ye Xiao’s power to control her soul and reverse the momentum of this attack.</p><p>Once that succeeded, the overall situation would be determined!</p><p>Once he lost, his soul would disappear!</p><p>“Zi la…”</p><p>Blood spurted from the right eye under the mask of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>Ye Xiao’s soul body, which had been pulled back to its main body, also mustered all its strength to resist the distortion of its will by the Three Loathsome Eyes.</p><p>Just as she felt that her condition had declined and that she could not resist the invasion of the Three Loathsome Eyes…</p><p>“Fall!”</p><p>Ye Xiao gritted her teeth and forcefully gave the order. In the end, she gave up all resistance and allowed her soul body to be pulled back to her original body.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Ye Xiao’s soul returned to its scabbard, and its body smashed heavily onto the ground.</p><p>Three gray flowers appeared in its eyes and spun at a high speed.</p><p>Ye Xiao had taken a gamble.</p><p>As long as one’s soul was destroyed by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, even if the Three Loathsome Eyes controlled him, it would automatically be removed.</p><p>At that moment, the world fell silent along with Ye Xiao’s thoughts.</p><p>High up in the sky, the huge black-sleeved white bone hand that protruded from the God of Death owl’s eye held the sharp scythe. It dripped with ink and slashed in the direction of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
