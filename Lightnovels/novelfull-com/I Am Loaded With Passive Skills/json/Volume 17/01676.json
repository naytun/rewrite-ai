(3)</p><p>But…</p><p>Ghost City of the Netherworld?</p><p>When she was under the control of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, didn’t Ye Xiao say that it would be her burial ground?</p><p>“Be careful of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi was unable to stop Ye Xiao’s only means to save herself. He could only use telepathic communication to remind Ye Xiao.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man…</p><p>Although she did not know what he would do.</p><p>However, under the Saint Calamity, even a Demi-Saint did not dare to act rashly. He would not rush over to interfere, right?</p><p>At most, he could only watch Ye Xiao become a Saint from afar. After she succeeded, he might use some tricks?</p><p>If Ye Xiao had made preparations in advance, perhaps she could have swallowed him instead?</p><p>There was no response.</p><p>As soon as Yu Lingdi finished speaking, Ye Xiao’s form trembled and disappeared into the spatial rift.</p><p>Huang Quan finally looked away and was sure that Mei Siren wasn’t boasting.</p><p>“Penetrating Divine Senses…”</p><p>The old Sword Deity’s sword image attack had truly shocked him.</p><p>Under the wrath of the Saint Calamity, even if Ye Xiao shifted her position, the Thunder Calamity still split into two.</p><p>It chased after Ye Xiao while it tried to bury Mei Siren in Zheng Huang Palace.</p><p>But that was all.</p><p>Huang Quan understood that since Mei Siren was confident that he could resist the Saint Calamity, he didn’t need to worry anymore.</p><p>All the companions he summoned had used their own strength to block all the obstacles for him.</p><p>Then, he could act recklessly and no longer needed to hide.</p><p>In any case, even if the sky should fall, so be it… The ancient Swordsman would hold it up!</p><p>Jiang Buyi was like Huang Quan; his worries vanished.</p><p>However, whether or not he could attack depended on whether the exemption order was hidden in Yu Lingdi’s severed right arm.</p><p>Or perhaps, Yu Lingdi had a trick up his sleeve?</p><p>Jiang Buyi looked toward Yu Lingdi.</p><p>As soon as their eyes met, he understood why this young man was worthy of being the Spirit Division Chief. He did not disappoint him.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>In Zhen Huang Palace, the water-type Power Upanishad Formation suddenly opened.</p><p>A bloody arm suddenly emerged from Jiang Buyi’s forehead. In the palm of the arm, there was an exemption order. It was ruthlessly slapped against Jiang Buyi’s glabella.</p><p>“When did they make the exchange?”</p><p>There was curiosity in Huang Quan’s eyes, but he was not anxious at all.</p><p>He felt that at that moment, his action had been the swiftest.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, a slash of Absolute Power that came from Yu Lingdi, a minor Cutting Path Stage, would not be able to move the exemption order from the severed arm.</p><p>But …</p><p>He had still successfully moved it!</p><p>“Is this the power of the Upanishad? It really makes one jealous!”</p><p>Huang Quan thought of the Spatial Upanishad shorty.</p><p>At that time, if it wasn’t for the suppression of his cultivation level and the restriction of the power of time, even he wouldn’t have been able to stop the white-haired shorty’s escape.</p><p>Spatial Upanishad…</p><p>Water-type Upanishad…</p><p>There were talented people in every generation!</p><p>It was a pity, if he could master the Upanishad, then everything would be perfect.</p><p>“Hurry up!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s eyes were almost crossed as he stared at the Blood Hand that emerged from his forehead. He even took the initiative to greet it with his glabella.</p><p>A slap!</p><p>One solution!</p><p>The Demi-Saint combat strength was completely unleashed!</p><p>However, how could Huang Quan allow Jiang Buyi’s dream to come true?</p><p>“Time, freeze.”</p><p>An illusory wave swept past.</p><p>After the soft chant, Zhen Huang Palace instantly fell silent!</p><p>The sound of the Thunder Calamity stopped in mid-air and Mei Siren’s paper fan stopped spinning in his hand. Jiang Buyi’s raised head instantly froze, and Yu Lingdi’s horrified look fell on the spot.</p><p>The only thing that could still move in the hall was Huang Quan.</p><p>“Why resist?”</p><p>“You will never succeed, Demi-Saint Jiang!”</p><p>He slowly stepped forward and leisurely strolled over to Jiang Buyi’s side, and reached out for the exemption order.</p><p>“Get lost!! ”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s eyes were about to pop out. Finally, he could not suppress the crazy restlessness in his heart. His Holy Power exploded, and his sacred physique exploded into fairy-colored clouds.</p><p>Others could be controlled by Huang Quan.</p><p>However, Jiang Buyi was a Demi-Saint, not an ant!</p><p>As long as he didn’t want to hold it in any longer, he could make a move at any time!</p><p>As long as… Forget about that bullsh*t ‘countdown to exile’!</p><p>“Cloud Devouring Technique!”</p><p>The colorful clouds were so big that even the entire Zhen Huang Palace couldn’t contain them.</p><p>The blood-colored Thunder Calamity from the Nine Heavens that struck Mei Siren was not even split by the Sword Image.</p><p>“Chi.”</p><p>Instead, Jiang Buyi’s sacred physique swallowed it in one gulp!</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s colorful clouds were instantly filled with the blood-colored aura of tribulation. Thunder rumbled within it as his Sacred Physique seemed to have transformed into a second Saint Calamity.</p><p>“Die, you freaking Saint!”</p><p>The blood-colored clouds spewed forth like the saliva of an alpaca, and a thick blood-colored Thunder Calamity that resembled the Optimus Prime Pillar shot out from it.</p><p>“Peng, peng, peng…”</p><p>The void shattered, layer by layer.</p><p>The air waves were pushed away.</p><p>The blood-colored Thunder Calamity boosted by the Holy Power, completely demonstrated the aesthetics of violence. After it shattered the frozen time order at the scene, it landed on Huang Quan’s head.</p><p>“As expected of a Demi-Saint.”</p><p>Huang Quan smiled. He raised his hands and quickly formed a seal. Then, he placed his palms together.</p><p>“3,000 Dao Worlds!”</p><p>He tilted his head back, and the spatial aura on his body spread out and turned corporeal.</p><p>He was clearly only a few millimeters away from the blood-colored Thunder Calamity. At this moment, with a ‘Deng Deng’ sound, the two seemed to be so close, yet worlds apart. Layers of space-time worlds appeared in between.</p><p>“Peng, peng, peng…”</p><p>This new space-time world obviously couldn’t withstand the impact of the Holy Power. It was blasted through at the speed of tens or hundreds of times in an instant.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
