(3)</p><p>He really didn’t expect this!</p><p>He had waited for Huang Quan to run so far before taking out the secondary plane door.</p><p>With a flick of his wrist, she was back!</p><p>Moreover, Huang Quan flew all the way here, and specks of silver light descended in front of him again. The river of time was about to descend!</p><p>“He wants to attack me from the river of time!”</p><p>“He couldn’t tamper with history because the person he wanted to tamper with last time was a demi-saint, Jiang Buyi. He was powerless.”</p><p>“But I’m just…Cutting Path Stage! As long as he wanted to, even if he couldn’t tamper with history, he could still do something to the secondary plane door that I took out in the previous period of time in the river of time and affect the current me and secondary plane door!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi paled in shock.</p><p>Huang Quan hasn’t made a move yet, but the consequences he knew from his analysis had already made him feel terrified.</p><p>The time attribute was too mysterious and unpredictable!</p><p>“The secondary plane door…”</p><p>“What is this thing again?”</p><p>The Three Tribulation Eyes on Jiang Buyi’s face had already been retracted as he looked over with a slightly surprised expression.</p><p>What did he see?</p><p>Just now, did Yu Lingdi intercept his thunder calamity?</p><p>If he could also possess such an ability, did that mean that with a nod from Yu Lingdi, he, Jiang Buyi, would be able to survive and not have to attempt to transcend the thunder calamity at all?</p><p>“Stop him!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi didn’t have the time to explain. He pointed at the distant Huang Quan that was about to enter the river of time and roared.</p><p>Jiang Buyi looked back.</p><p>Ah.</p><p>It was that river…</p><p>If Jiang Buyi remembered correctly, he died under his river.</p><p>Jiang Buyi even took a special glance at the Hun Che on Huang Quan’s back, as well as the other sword that was entwined with a sealed belt.</p><p>He still could not understand the abilities of these two weapons.</p><p>However, it didn’t matter. They could be exchanged for Evil Sin Bow, which was renowned throughout the world, and still counted as two weapons!</p><p>Jiang Buyi could immediately understand how heavy the things on Huang Quan’s back were.</p><p>“If I still have other tricks up my sleeve, I do not mind helping you…”</p><p>After Jiang Buyi finished speaking, he ran off with Yu Lingdi on his back.</p><p>F*ck your mother’s help, transcend the tribulation comes first!</p><p>Yu Lingdi doesn’t believe Jiang Buyi will let him die.</p><p>He’s of great use to Jiang Buyi now!</p><p>“Stop him!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi shouted until he was exhausted.</p><p>However, there was not a fool present in the arena.</p><p>Even if Jiang Buyi had signed a contract with Yu Lingdi, he would not be foolish enough to do it for others…To sacrifice his life for the treasure.</p><p>The two orders of ‘stop Huang Quan’ and ‘bring Yu Lingdi away’ existed simultaneously. Jiang Buyi only needed to know which one was more important.</p><p>They were all old foxes.</p><p>They even knew how to avoid the Orders of the Great Path.</p><p>How could Jiang Buyi be so stupid as to turn back and risk his life to fight Huang Quan, who was facing a threefold saint calamity?</p><p>He only looked crazy, but his heart was as still as water.</p><p>“Whoosh.”</p><p>When they passed each other, they saw a familiar figure standing on the ruins in the distance.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao!</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s heart trembled, but soon, joy appeared on his face.</p><p>He didn’t slow down, nor did he stop to greet them, because he knew that the reinforcements from the Holy Divine Palace had arrived.</p><p>Yu Lingdi would help him turn all of this into the best shield!</p><p>“Sword Saint Rao!”</p><p>As expected, just as Jiang Buyi’s thoughts reached this point, Yu Lingdi overjoyed voice sounded.</p><p>Yu Lingdi could tell that Jiang Buyi was unwilling to slow down. He could only try his best to be concise and pass on all the information about this place.</p><p>“The secondary plane door is in my hands!”</p><p>“Jiang Buyi has signed a contract with us, and the Demi-Saint Mysterious Decree is the witness!”</p><p>“Huang Quan is going to make a move against me. Stop…Kill him!”</p><p>Three sentences.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“The secondary plane door…”</p><p>She murmured softly and raised her gaze to look at Huang Quan, who had already walked into the river of time. He was about to touch a certain moment in time held by Yu Lingdi’s secondary plane door.</p><p>At the same time, Huang Quan seemed to have sensed something. His movements came to a halt as he looked up.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>At this moment, the river of time seemed to ripple.</p><p>Huang Quan’s figure within it trembled slightly, and his clothes also had some creases.</p><p>His pupils quivered as if he had recognized that this person was Rao Yaoyao, who had ascended. She was a Sword Saint, not a Sword Deity!</p><p>The so-called Sword Deity…</p><p>In the entire world, there were only seven sword deities, and all of them were ancient swordsmen. At the very least, they were half-spiritual swordsmen with ancient swordsman backgrounds.</p><p>As for the pure-spiritual swordsmen of the era of spirit cultivation, none of them could make the list.</p><p>With such a high standard of the ranking list, even if the Sword Deity in it is at the bottom of the rankings, as long as they were in the Demi-Saint State, could they be simple?</p><p>Furthermore, regardless of Yaoyao’s strength, resources, and background…None of them were at the bottom!</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>With just one glance, Huang Quan knew that he definitely couldn’t take on Rao Yaoyao after she became a Saint.</p><p>This wasn’t something that could be solved with one or two drops of Holy blood.</p><p>With three huge saint calamities hanging above his head, it could be a tremendous pressure for anyone!</p><p>Huang Quan suddenly turned around, not even caring about the secondary plane door in the river of time.</p><p>“If you don’t run, your life will be in danger!”</p><p>The methods of ancient swordsmen were too terrifying!</p><p>Spiritual Cultivators were equivalent to one of the paths in the Way of Spiritual Cultivation, such as the Path of Water.</p><p>A lunatic among the ancient swordsmen…In fact, it was not a minority. 99% of them were all aiming for the goal of mastering the Way of the Sword.</p><p>In the Spiritual Cultivation World, this was equivalent to saying, “Ha, what’s so great about the Path of Water? Even if I mastered it, I have only reached the first level of the Fantasy Sword Technique. What I want is to grasp the profoundness of the Great Path of all attributes, which is the entire realm of the Nine Major Sword Techniques.”</p><p>If they weren’t lunatics, then what were they?</p><p>Huang Quan turned around and ran without hesitation.</p><p>In his eyes, an ancient sword swordsman at the demi-saint level was even more terrifying than ten Jiang Buyi in his peak condition combined!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
