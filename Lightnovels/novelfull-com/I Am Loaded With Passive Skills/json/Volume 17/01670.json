Don’t listen to her nonsense. Where are we going next?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned and did not speak for a long while.</p><p>He didn’t reply to Lei Xi’er’s words. He looked behind him and said after a moment of silence.</p><p>“It’s right here. Wait a moment.”</p><p>“Brother Chen, the Demi-Saint has arrived!”</p><p>Elder Han, who was on his shoulder, suddenly raised his head and looked at the void.</p><p>His Perception was very sensitive, so he was very proud that he could help Brother Chen sense the arrival of a Demi-Saint.</p><p>However, after he waited for a while, Elder Han realized that his words did not evoke any reaction from Brother Chen!</p><p>“What happened to you?”</p><p>Elder Han turned his head and grabbed Brother Chen’s ear with his four claws. He could see with his Saint’s Will that this young man’s expression had suddenly become very uncertain.</p><p>“It’s fine.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s main body stopped moving. His Perception range finally connected with the second true body.</p><p>After that, he could teleport to his junior sister’s side.</p><p>But now, he suddenly couldn’t be happy.</p><p>The Demi-Saint you’re talking about should not be Ye Xiao, who’s undergoing the Saint Ascension?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“Yes.” Elder Han nodded.</p><p>“Then who was it?”</p><p>“I don’t know either, but I’m certain that he’s a proper Demi-Saint. His aura is very weak, and he hid it very well. He’s definitely not Demi-Saint Rao who just broke through!”</p><p>“Where’s Demi-Saint Jiang?”</p><p>“I’m not sure about that. I’ve never fought him before. I’ve only heard you mention this person.”</p><p>“Where did he come from?”</p><p>“Outside the First Hall of Sins!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had to temporarily put aside his worries about his little junior sister and start to think about these serious matters.</p><p>If a Demi-Saint from the Holy Divine Palace entered the arena, it meant that the First Hall of Sins would be in great turmoil.</p><p>At that time, everything would be a big battle on the surface, because the Holy Divine Palace would not care about this or that.</p><p>Unlike the Five Decays of Heaven and Man; he needed to do things secretly… Ha, a lurker in the dark, he described it so well!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes turned cold, but he quickly recovered.</p><p>“How many Demi-Saints did you sense?”</p><p>“Just one…”</p><p>As Elder Han spoke, he hesitantly lowered his head from the top of Brother Chen’s head. His round eyes widened and he said, “Do you think Demi-Saints are like cabbages? How many do you think there are?”</p><p>“You’ll find out soon enough. Demi-Saint Stage cabbages have sprouted everywhere.” Xu Xiaoshou snorted.</p><p>He felt that it was time for the Saint Servant to make a move.</p><p>Otherwise, with just him and Elder Han, no matter how much trouble he stirred up, he might not be able to block Rao Yaoyao’s sword after she became a Saint.</p><p>A shit-stirring stick couldn’t stir a hard lump!</p><p>“Oh, right.” Xu Xiaoshou was alarmed. “If you can find him, he must be able to find you too? ”</p><p>“Ji ji ji!”</p><p>Elder Han was overjoyed when he heard that. “Brother Chen, you’ve underestimated me. My escape… Uh, I’m very good at at escape techniques. Unless Demi-Saint Rao comes over and locks me up, no one will be able to find me.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t doubt Elder Han’s ability, but he wasn’t that optimistic either. “If she came over, can you sense it before she does? ”</p><p>“She has just broken through to the Demi-Saint Realm. Wherever she goes, it’s as if she’s carrying a signboard across the street. Brother Chen, you don’t have to worry about this. We’ll avoid her for the time being.”</p><p>For now…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know how long it would last.</p><p>He glanced back in the direction of Zhen Huang Palace and thought of Master Siren and Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>If these two bodyguards were still around, perhaps he would not be afraid.</p><p>However, the Communication Talisman could allow Master Siren to find him, but he couldn’t locate Master Siren in turn.</p><p>Therefore, even after so long, Master Siren still hadn’t come in search of him.</p><p>He must have been delayed by something important, right?</p><p>I wonder if the two of them managed to exchange their Death Exemption Tokens…</p><p>“Sigh.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed lightly and no longer cared about the follow-up of the many matters hidden in the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>After all, this had nothing to do with him. It was good that he found little junior sister.</p><p>“Follow closely!”</p><p>He shrugged and started to take the easy way out as he hurried.</p><p>In a flash, he found his second true body. With a Swish, the second true body had a relieved expression on his face as he entered the Yuan Mansion and picked up his fishing rod.</p><p>Elder Han was indeed truly a master beast of escape.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s ‘take the easy way out’ could not even put him off.</p><p>No matter how he tried to escape, as long as he didn’t disappear on the spot.</p><p>Every time he teleported out of the space, Elder Han would be able to stick to his feet and lie on his shoulder. He never fell behind.</p><p>It was a waste to use this soul-chasing ability that was used for a hurried escape.</p><p>“Why are there two of them again?”</p><p>Mu Zixi frowned as she looked at the two Xu Xiaoshous in front of her as they exchanged identities.</p><p>Fortunately, she knew that her Senior Brother used to scare people with multiple identities, so she didn’t care if there was one or two Xu Xiaoshous.</p><p>Back in the Yuan Mansion, she had already been frightened by these identical twins!</p><p>Therefore, when Xu Xiaoshou’s main body appeared to replace the second true body, she was only surprised for a moment. Her attention was quickly attracted by the little white cat that laid on Xu Xiaoshou’s shoulder.</p><p>“Greedy the Cat Spirit?”</p><p>Upon closer inspection, the furry white creature didn’t look like a cat. Its tail was fluffier than Greedy the Cat Spirit’s, more like the tail of a squirrel.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
