(1)</h1><p>1686 Crazy Half-Saint, Three Tribulation Eyes, Buried Together! (1)</p><p>“Elder Yan, how is it? Why don’t you come over here first? There’s a good show on at my side.”</p><p>“No, too many people have undergone the Saint Ascension in such a short period of time. Something must be wrong. We have to go to the Fallen Abyss again. If we don’t investigate the chaos there, the battle there is not so clear cut. Don’t forget how these people entered the Abyss Island.”</p><p>“You’re right. After all, there were already three of them…”</p><p>“Don’t just focus on the battle. When you have time, pay attention to the Saint Ascension cultivators. If they were from the dark faction, with your ability, just destroy them.”</p><p>“I will, but are you sure you don’t want to come to the First Hall of Sins?”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“Huang Quan and Mei Siren left together. They wanted to kill Demi-Saint Jiang and even summoned Hun Che. Demi-Saint Jiang must have lost his Demi-Saint Incarnation. I wonder how many more tricks he has up his sleeve…”</p><p>“Mei Siren? When will you make your move?”</p><p>“Let me watch for a while longer. The climax hasn’t even started yet. One of them has to be at the end of their tether before I can make my appearance.”</p><p>“Pay attention to the Stealth.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, they’re having fun with their fight. No one will pay any attention to me.”</p><p>“Pull Rao Yaoyao into your battle channel. I will keep an eye on her in case anything should happen to her.”</p><p>“No, Hallmaster Dao specially instructed us not to bother about her. Rao Yaoyao is very useful, so let her run amok on her own.”</p><p>“In this case… How many Mystery Boxes did you bring? I only brought enough for my own use.”</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao did not have many left, so he only gave me three.”</p><p>“It’s enough. If necessary, give one to Rao Yaoyao. You can distribute the rest yourself.”</p><p>“I will.”</p><p>“That’s it then.”</p><p>With a click, the communication with the saint’s will was cut off.</p><p>In the sky above Zhen Huang Palace, Number Two’s human form had completely disappeared. It turned into an illusory Order of the Great Path that occupied the sky.</p><p>He was like the last hunter that crouched on the spider web as he waited for someone to crash into the web and then he would give the final blow.</p><p>Number Two had just arrived.</p><p>As soon as he entered the First Hall of Sins, the first thing he saw was the scene of Hun Che beheading the Saint.</p><p>His saint’s will swept outside the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>It was unknown who was about to transcend the tribulation of the blood-red Saint Calamity, but they were ready to move to the Ghost City of the Netherworld.</p><p>The only aura that Number Two could sense was that of the Blood World Pearl.</p><p>There was no doubt that the person who was about to transcend the tribulation was a crazy guy. He was not even a semi-saint person, but he dared to go through the Saint Calamity forcibly after he stole the Blood World Pearl.</p><p>How should he put it?</p><p>His courage was commendable, but he would definitely die!</p><p>“Whoosh.”</p><p>At this moment, a cloud that dashed in at full speed from the First Hall of Sins attracted Number Two’s attention.</p><p>That was the commotion that took place outside Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>Coincidentally, the target of the cloud was also Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>Number Two didn’t pay any special attention to it so it would not trigger a reaction from his Perception and alert the Demi-Saint.</p><p>However, when he glanced over earlier, he saw the Holy Power of the cloud attribute above the flowing clouds.</p><p>Of course, what mattered most were the three eye-catching strange pupils that hung at the front of the flowing cloud.</p><p>“Is it finally here?”</p><p>“The Lei Family Eyes that were scattered during the Lei Family incident were either lost or recovered. Only three were left.”</p><p>“Jiang Buyi, if I were you, I would also be anxious.”</p><p>“Three Tribulation Eyes…”</p><p>“Jiang Buyi?”</p><p>Yu Lingdi stared blankly as Jiang Buyi clutched his throat and fell to the ground. His face was pale.</p><p>He had already said it!</p><p>He would bring him out of the First Hall of Sins at full speed and leave this d*mned place.</p><p>Why did this guy rush back?</p><p>Even if the exemption order in the river of time was crushed by Huang Quan, at worst, Jiang Buyi would be exiled and come back after the countdown to exile.</p><p>Even if there was only one day left, less than one day!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had already completed her Saint Ascension. Was she afraid that she wouldn’t be able to come over?</p><p>If a Demi-Saint activated the secondary plane door, it would be possible to distort the rules of the Abyss Island and pull Jiang Buyi back from the land of exile.</p><p>But…</p><p>It was too late!</p><p>Jiang Buyi rushed back and fell under Huang Quan’s blade.</p><p>With the space attributes and the Hun Che, even if Huang Quan’s cultivation level was only that of a higher void, it was more than enough to kill a Saint.</p><p>The difference in strength could have a great impact on a battle of this level, but it would also be small.</p><p>The key was brains and tactics!</p><p>Yu Lingdi was silent.</p><p>Actually, he understood that Jiang Buyi did not know that he had a secondary plane door.</p><p>Even if he knew, it was also impossible for Yu Lingdi to hand over the secondary plane door to Jiang Buyi, an outsider of the Holy Divine Palace, to urge him on.</p><p>It was as if all fate had been predestined.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi finally fell to the ground.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng could use the Evil Sin Bow and the Eyes of the Great Path to guard the Central Region’s Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe and attack the five domains of the continent.</p><p>One could imagine how powerful the nine supreme divine weapons were.</p><p>Even a Demi-Saint’s soul would not recover that easily if it had been cut by a Hun Che.</p><p>“Ta.”</p><p>Huang Quan stopped in front of Jiang Buyi.</p><p>He crouched down, opened Jiang Buyi’s eyes, and examined them carefully.</p><p>“Where are your Lei Family’s Eyes?”</p><p>“You’re about to die. Why don’t you bring it out? Do you want to bring the Lei Family’s Eyes to hell with you?”</p><p>“Or is this just your Demi-Saint Incarnation? You still have a backup plan and decided to fake your death to leave this place?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s eyes widened. With his last breath, he stared at Huang Quan and could not speak.</p><p>Mei Siren closed his fan, walked over, and said softly, “I once killed his Demi-Saint Incarnation in the Forest of Miracles.”</p><p>Huang Quan nodded. He knew about this.</p><p>“Under normal circumstances, there are no more than three Demi-Saint Incarnations. This should be the limit of the number of Demi-Saint Incarnations that you, Jiang Buyi, can condense.”</p><p>“Well, if I were you, I would leave a Demi-Saint incarnation in my hometown in the Northern Region.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
