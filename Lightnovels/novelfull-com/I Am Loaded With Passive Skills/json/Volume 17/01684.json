(6)</p><p>His body didn’t reveal any majestic aura, but his tone was shockingly arrogant.</p><p>“And…”</p><p>“Don’t become me. Surpass me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was quite shaken by his words.</p><p>He vaguely understood what kind of person the young Bazhun’an was.</p><p>Even if it were somewhat unbelievable, if one really wanted to make a comparison, it would be as if people like Rao Yaoyao and Jiang Buyi against Kui Leihan, Shenyi, and Bazhun’an.</p><p>What a trash!</p><p>He was really trash!</p><p>But …</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that something was wrong.</p><p>Soon, he realised this statement was incorrect because Bazhun’an had secretly changed the concept.</p><p>It wasn’t Rao Yaoyao and Jiang Buyi that were useless.</p><p>It was because people like Kui Leihan and Shenyi whom he talked about were too monstrous!</p><p>This was almost the top-notch, elite group of people who are few and far between in the world.</p><p>Bazhun’an didn’t mention their shortcomings, only their strengths. How could one compare them only based on this?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, do you know how to spell the word ‘death’?” Bazhun’an’s voice suddenly sank.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyelids twitched.</p><p>“What, you want to kill me?”</p><p>“I know…”</p><p>“You know nothing!”</p><p>Bazhun’an immediately cursed,</p><p>“At your age, you don’t need to know how to write the word ‘death’. Youngsters only need to know how to be ‘maniacal’.”</p><p>“Everyone beside me is nothing, and I am the king!”</p><p>“Smart people fear two types of people. One is those who are smarter than them, and the other is boorish people.”</p><p>“No matter how smart you are, you are no match for Dao Qiongcang now, and you can’t surpass me to become a competitor.”</p><p>“Since that’s the case, you’re only in charge of being boorish. After you’re done being boorish, bring your brain along!”</p><p>“Your brain is for you to solve problems after you’re done being boorish, not for you to be overcautious.”</p><p>“If there is really a problem that even you cannot resolve, I will naturally take action…Do you understand what I mean?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>Such “boorish” remarks were really too boorish!</p><p>However, he seemed to understand what Bazhun’an meant.</p><p>Chaos!</p><p>It was completely chaotic!</p><p>Things weren’t chaotic enough yet. It would be best to blow up the entire Abyss Island to meet the standards, and it’s only considered a full score if the Inner Island was also blown up. And if something went wrong…Bazhun’an would be the one to take responsibility!</p><p>“I understood.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was deep in thought. Bazhun’an had pointed out his current problem. It was not explosive enough.</p><p>This wasn’t a problem.</p><p>“I didn’t know in the past, but with your last sentence as a guarantee, it’s easy to mess things up.”</p><p>“Isn’t this a little extreme…” Kong Yuhen heard these words and spoke hesitantly.</p><p>“I won’t.”</p><p>Bazhun’an was in this self-proclaimed utopia, where there were no taboos. He could call out anyone’s name without the fear of Perception.</p><p>After returning to his seat, he refilled their cups and smiled as he filled them.</p><p>“It’s not a good thing to be timid. When you’re young, you should be frivolous and should not turn back until you hit a wall.”</p><p>“Didn’t Wen Ting lose to you that time? After that, he learned to work hard. He was protected too well by the Burial Sword Tomb in the past, and his experience was not even as good as Gou Wuyue’s.”</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao was the same. Didn’t she only become a Saint on Abyss Island after she hit a wall? It was just Dao Qiongcang’s choice!”</p><p>As he spoke, Bazhun’an looked at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“If you can be as sharp as I am, by the time you hit a wall, you might already be a descendant of the Holy Emperor.”</p><p>“Of course, I hope you can surpass me and never hit a wall.”</p><p>“Or to put it another way… When you press forward, no one can be an obstacle to your progress!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lowered his eyebrows and pondered.</p><p>Bazhun’an’s words were actually not without reason, but they only applied to a small group of people, the most extreme and exceptional geniuses.</p><p>When a sword was sharp enough, the speed of breaking through anything with it would be the fastest!</p><p>Because any obstacle would become its grinding stone, so there would be no injuries after hitting a wall.</p><p>If there were to be any, it would not happen that soon.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s true obstacle might have been on this Abyss Island, so she immediately conferred the title of Saint.</p><p>“Wen Ting” that Bazhun’an talked about was the same. He had only hit a wall in the War of the Ten High Nobles, meaning he had never had a match before.</p><p>When did Kui Leihan, Shenyi and the others stop their victorious march?</p><p>He was only a Master, yet he was already starting to be overcautious…</p><p>If he could reach demi-saint or Holy Emperor before hitting the wall. Or perhaps, the wall would have disappeared.</p><p>That kind of breakthrough speed was definitely much faster than his current state, right?</p><p>“Have you completely understood?” Bazhun’an looked at the young man thoughtfully and asked with a cup in hand.</p><p>“I have a question.” Xu Xiaoshou said.</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>“Have you fought with Shenyi before? During the times of the Ten High Nobles.”</p><p>Kong Yuhen also pricked up his ears.</p><p>According to Bazhun’an, Shenyi had killed him in one move.</p><p>At this point, Kong Yuhen was also very curious about Bazhun’an himself.</p><p>“Isn’t this nonsense?”</p><p>Bazhun’an put down his cup and smirked, “Why else do you think he followed me?”</p><p>“What about Kui Leihan?” Xu Xiaoshou asked again.</p><p>“Cao Yihan, he won against me by a day!”</p><p>Bazhun’an twisted his head and crackled. “After the ‘God Punishment Tribulation’, he was barely able to fight me to a draw. However, after the ‘God Punishment Tribulation’, I comprehended ‘sword cognition’, so he naturally couldn’t beat me.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>As expected, the title “Eighth Sword Deity” was not for nothing.</p><p>But …</p><p>“Gulp”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
