(2)</p><p>Elder Han raised his eyebrows, feeling that Chen Tan’s change in topic was very spontaneous. He was finding it difficult to keep up but still nodded, “I knew him.”</p><p>“Who is he under?” Chen Tan asked.</p><p>“Patriarch Wuji isn’t exactly under someone. He’s one of the highest-ranking people on the Inner Island other than the White Vein’s Third Ancestor and the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon. That’s because he’s the only one who has mastered the Divine Secret while most of the rest was sent here by the Divine Secret instead.”</p><p>After a pause, Elder Han added, “If I had to say who he is closer to, it should be the White Vein’s Third Ancestor, the Seven Trees Emperor. It was also with the support of the Seven Trees Emperor that he got the chance to leave the Inner Island.”</p><p>No wonder he was so arrogant… Xu Xiaoshou immediately came to a realization, “How does he compare to you?”</p><p>“Compared to me?” Elder Han jumped in fright. Clearly, he had never thought of this before, “He’s an emperor, and I’m nothing…”</p><p>Elder Han was already being very tactful. A talent like the Patriarch Wuji who had mastered the Divine Secret was a sought-after talent no matter where he went.</p><p>He was different.</p><p>When the people on the Inner Island were in a good mood, they would show him some respect and call him “Elder Han”. When they weren’t in a good mood and met him on the road, they would just simply wave at him and grin, “Xiao Han, come here! Hehehe~”</p><p>Why was their difference in status within the Inner Island so significant even though they were both demi-saints? Xu Xiaoshou was somewhat puzzled.</p><p>He realized that Elder Han was not very sure about proper matters. That being said, the biggest benefit this fellow could provide was that he was a member of the Inner Island of the Abyss Island, allowing him to reveal some secret information.</p><p>At the same time, Xu Xiaoshou also recalled and understood why Patriarch Wuji dared to confront Feng Yujin when he appeared at the Spirit Gem Trade Fair.</p><p>To think a mere demi-saint dared to provoke Feng Yujin and even claimed that their status was almost equal. Xu Xiaoshou didn’t understand before, but now he finally did.</p><p>“Do you know Feng Yujin?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“Feng who?” Elder Han was stunned.</p><p>“Holy Emperor Fengtian, Feng Yujin, the one with the seal attribute.” Xu Xiaoshou explained.</p><p>At this moment, Elder Han was so scared that his pupils dilated, “Feng, Feng… You even know Holy Emperor Fengtian?”</p><p>Who was Chen Tan?!</p><p>Elder Han was flustered.</p><p>Chen Tan clearly wasn’t from the Inner Island, so how did he know so many people? How did he dare to call Holy Emperor Fengtian by his name?</p><p>This was no different from calling the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, “Blackie, come here.”</p><p>Elder Han said shakily, “Holy Emperor Fengtian is a subordinate of Demonic Emperor Black Dragon. His status might seem to be lower than the White Vein’s Third Ancestor and the Demon Emperor Black Dragon, but no one dares to think so. That’s because, in the outside world, he’s a Holy Emperor. He’s on the same level as the Third Ancestor and the Demon Emperor… Moreover, the people of the Black Vein are very irritable and not to be trifled with.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou really wanted to spit on this guy, but he was too cowardly. None of them were to be trifled with.</p><p>“Why is his status similar to that of Patriarch Wuji although he’s a Holy Emperor? Was he beaten up by the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon?” Xu Xiaoshou was puzzled.</p><p>“Yes,” Elder Han was actually a little afraid to make any rash comments, but under Chen Tan’s pressure – who was no longer a mortal in his eyes and had a terrifying network of connections – he could only try his best to explain, “The Spell Forbidden Barrier on the Inner Island of the Abyss Island is very strong. The others have their strengths, either relying on their physical bodies or main bodies… The Holy Emperor Fengtian relies on his seal attribute and his Seal Body, and under the suppression of the Spell Forbidden Barrier, he only has less than half of his power left…”</p><p>“I get it,” Xu Xiaoshou interrupted Elder Han’s words with a wave of his hand, not wanting this guy to continue talking nonsense.</p><p>So that’s how it was!</p><p>The Seven Trees Emperor’s main body was the spirit of seven blood trees.</p><p>As for the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, he still had the physical strength of the Holy Emperor dragon body even when within the Spell Forbidden Barrier.</p><p>Compared to that, the weakling Feng Yujin was like a Spiritual Cultivator who had been deprived of his Spiritual Cultivation power under the Spell Forbidden Barrier.</p><p>What was the point of fighting then?</p><p>He only had his human body left. It was already very difficult for him to be ranked among the top under the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon among various demi-saint ghost beasts, ancient beasts, and chaotic treasures.</p><p>Even Patriarch Wuji was probably living more comfortably on the Inner Island than Feng Yujin. At least others will look for him when they need the Divine Secret, but Feng Yujin…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou understood why Feng Yujin had forgotten all about his mission and was enjoying himself once he came out.</p><p>This guy belonged to the Shengshen Continent. He could do well in the five regions, while he could only be bullied on the Inner Island.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that Bazhun’an had personally come after the battle in the Eighth Palace and asked him to cooperate with them, Feng Yujin would have probably gone to God knows where with Mo Mo, who had a Seal Body as well.</p><p>“I roughly understand.”</p><p>After understanding some of the layouts of the Inner Island of the Abyss Island, Xu Xiaoshou was no longer confused.</p><p>He went through what he had just learned and tried to figure out the intention of Elder Han in bringing him these “plans” that couldn’t even be considered intelligence.</p><p>First of all, from the perspective of the Divine Prison Qing Shi, given Elder Han’s intelligence and combat strength, he would not have disclosed the entire plan to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>This way, even if he was caught, the Holy Divine Palace would not be able to obtain any useful information from him.</p><p>The Holy Divine Palace may have already known some information about the Inner Island of the Abyss Island, unlike Xu Xiaoshou, who was completely ignorant.</p><p>Thus, he had to find out the true intention of Divine Prison Qing Shi’s plan from Elder Han’s description.</p><p>“Great Infernal Ancestor and I have some connections… Seven Trees Emperor or Patriarch Wuji can barely be connected to me through the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch… and Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, I even have his dragon scales…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
