(3)</h1><p>1688 Crazy Half-Saint, Three Tribulation Eyes, Buried Together! (3)</p><p>“Give up.”</p><p>“Water belongs to the Dao, it definitely does not belong to an individual.”</p><p>“The most powerful Water-type Upanishad is someone who walks along with the Dao, follows the Way of the Heavens, and completely fuses with the Way of the Heavens. They become one of the Order and protect the world.”</p><p>“The water Upanishad that an individual grasps isn’t called the Water Upanishad at all. It just borrowed the Way of the Heavens.”</p><p>“Water has no physical form. It bends at every turn and cracks at every stone. Inaction is the Great Path. Once you have an obsession and want to run away, these things will become your restraints and inner demons.”</p><p>“So, stay.”</p><p>This made perfect sense!</p><p>At a certain moment, Yu Lingdi almost sat cross-legged on the spot to comprehend the Dao. Then, he gave up on his physical body and completely fused with the Way of the Heavens and became one of the laws.</p><p>However, he suddenly woke up and broke out in cold sweat.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that he was a final-stage Water-type Upanishad, he would have already passed the Sovereign Dao Realm and cut off his Dao.</p><p>If it had been any other ordinary Spiritual Cultivator, Mei Siren’s preaching would have shattered his Dao Heart and destroyed his foundational roots.</p><p>A good fighter had no illustrious achievements.</p><p>A good swordsman had a sharp tongue.</p><p>That d*mned Mei Siren didn’t even use his sword and had almost used his water-type power of the Upanishad to kill him!</p><p>“Secular Sword?”</p><p>“Teacher and student?”</p><p>The absolute power of enlightenment couldn’t be without a source. Mei Siren was not even a Demi-Saint or a Holy Emperor.</p><p>To have the ability to guide people to the Deviated Path, Yu Lingdi could only think of this intangible Ancient Sword Technique. It could kill people without them being aware of it-the Emotion Sword Technique!</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>He turned around abruptly.</p><p>The Power Upanishad Formation under his feet was displayed.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s body overflowed with the path energy. With a single word, the Power Upanishad Formation exploded.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The vicious teacher in his mind instantly exploded.</p><p>The power of enlightenment around him shattered like a mirror.</p><p>However, when he glanced over, the water in the great hall of Zhen Huang Palace was still there, but it was no longer under his control.</p><p>Yu Lingdi could not even locate Mei Siren.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>He instantly fused with the Path Principles in the void, disappeared and quickly made his escape.</p><p>Who are you looking for?</p><p>Run!</p><p>Run as far away as possible!</p><p>“Your Dao heart is really stable.”</p><p>“This is the first time that a Cutting Path Stage had been able to wake up from my enlightenment. As expected of the Water-type Upanishad.”</p><p>Inside Zhen Huang Palace, Mei Siren revealed his true Form and shook his head.</p><p>He held the paper fan and waited.</p><p>After he waited for a long time, his eyes finally lit up and he flung the fan away.</p><p>There was only one word on the fan:</p><p>“Untie!”</p><p>Fantasy Sword Technique, Dispel!</p><p>Yu Lingdi stopped running.</p><p>At this moment, his heart also stopped beating.</p><p>He realized that he did not escape into the Way of the Heavens, nor had he left Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>From the beginning to the end, he had only borrowed the power of Upanishad to integrate his body into the great array of Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>This great array was like a sea of mist, but also like the labyrinth of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>He began to wander around Zheng Huang Palace repeatedly in circles!</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Yu Lingdi wanted to break through this section and almost collapsed.</p><p>Someone was messing around with his mind!</p><p>“It’s a dream, time to wake up.”</p><p>Mei Siren chuckled. The water that filled half of Zhen Huang Palace split into tens of thousands of water swords with a swish.</p><p>The tips of the swords were pointed at Yu Lingdi, who had hidden himself in Zhen Huang Palace’s great array.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>Under the worship of ten thousand swords, they had not even begun to attack.</p><p>The sharpness caused the great array of Zhen Huang Palace to crack, and raked the outside of the palace with light.</p><p>“This is my water!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi hadn’t given up yet. He jumped out and displayed the Water-type Upanishad beneath his feet.</p><p>Water.</p><p>In his presence even Mei Siren couldn’t control his water to form the Ten Thousand Sword Technique!</p><p>“Sigh!” Mei Siren seemed to be in pain. He sighed softly. “It seems that you are not awake yet.”</p><p>He sighed.</p><p>With a sizzle, the layer of water on the surface of the void water swords drained away and disappeared. What was revealed was a small void stiletto that glowed with endless golden light.</p><p>Yu Lingdi, who still thought he could use the Water-type Upanishad to control the water swords, was instantly stunned. For a moment, he didn’t even have the strength to raise his hand.</p><p>It turned out that this was also fake…</p><p>The water sword was only the outer appearance of the Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>In fact, the water in Zhen Huang Palace had already been emptied by Mei Siren.</p><p>What he used was the Void Solidifying Sword Technique formed by the Ten Thousand Sword Technique. It was not the water summoned by Yu Lingdi’s Water-type Upanishad.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>“Defeat!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi only felt that all his methods were being controlled. He could not outsmart these old foxes at all!</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>The ten thousand swords in the void pressed down lightly. It could not even be considered an Absolute Imperial Control.</p><p>However, the pressure from the spiritual level and the aura of the Seven Sword Deity Mei Siren rendered Yu Lingdi powerless with no ability to resist.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s knees smashed onto the ground.</p><p>Under the suppression of the Ten Thousand Sword Technique, he could not even raise his head.</p><p>“I lost…”</p><p>“There’s no way to fight!”</p><p>After he formed a contract with Jiang Buyi, Yu Lingdi felt that he would have a chance to turn the tables.</p><p>The arrival of Huang Quan and Mei Siren, as well as the death of Jiang Buyi, had caused him to feel despair.</p><p>It was inevitable that he would condemn Jiang Buyi in his heart.</p><p>A Demi-Saint when faced with two higher void levels, couldn’t even kill one of them and instead was killed on the spot.</p><p>Yu Lingdi felt that even if he made a move, he would not be defeated so quickly.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was really a noob!</p><p>However, when it was really his turn to face Huang Quan and Mei Siren alone, Yu Lingdi finally experienced the sense of defeat that Jiang Buyi might have felt at that time.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
