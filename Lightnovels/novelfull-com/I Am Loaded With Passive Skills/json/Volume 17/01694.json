(2)</p><p>More importantly, there was still the grand ceremony of the Ten Thunder Calamity to welcome her arrival?</p><p>“Old dog Jiang, are you crazy? You want to kill me too?!”</p><p>The moment Yu Lingdi’s gaze met the Three Tribulation Eyes, he cried out in alarm and hurriedly averted his gaze.</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>Huang Quan and Mei Siren were unable to resist under the Guidance of the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree. He did it purely out of curiosity…</p><p>No!</p><p>Curiosity killed the cat!</p><p>At this moment, Yu Lingdi really hated himself to the core that he chose to take a look.</p><p>He could have been safe and sound.</p><p>Because Jiang Buyi’s Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree didn’t oppose him.</p><p>The reason why he was also ‘gathered’ over was not because of the word ‘gathered’, but because he was originally carried on Jiang Buyi’s shoulder!</p><p>But this was the crux of the problem.</p><p>Even though he was so close, Jiang Buyi’s hair was disheveled and his head was still lowered. He even brought Huang Quan and Mei Siren to his side and almost kissed them as they were in such close proximity. In the end, he even raised his head!</p><p>If it were someone else…</p><p>Who wouldn’t want to take a look at this guy?!</p><p>The sudden whim at that moment could not curb Yu Lingdi’s curiosity. As a result, he inadvertently met the eyes of Jiang Buyi, who had three eyes.</p><p>Was there anything in the world that could kill a Water-type Upanishad master with a mere glance?</p><p>Ha, Yu Lingdi didn’t think so in the past.</p><p>But now, he was in a state of panic!</p><p>“Three Tribulation Eyes… You lunatic, why didn’t you give me a warning. I’m in the same boat as you now!” Yu Lingdi scolded him loudly while he frantically pulled out something.</p><p>“Do you think I want you to live?” Jiang Buyi had a sinister smile. He looked over with the three eyes and blinked coldly.</p><p>Idiot!</p><p>Idiot!</p><p>Foolish!</p><p>Yu Lingdi retracted all his curses. He complained in a low voice and reminded him,”Don’t forget the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree.”</p><p>“Everyone is in trouble now…”</p><p>Yu Lingdi, who received such a crazy answer, didn’t say anything.</p><p>What a joke.</p><p>In just a few sentences, he could tell that Jiang Buyi did not wish to live anymore.</p><p>The best way to deal with a Demi-Saint who was on the verge of a breakdown was to not talk to him but simply go along with him.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Over at the side, Mei Siren and Huang Quan each chose a direction and flew away.</p><p>To them…</p><p>The Demi-Saint Tribulation was not easy to overcome.</p><p>There was only a slim chance to survive the third level of the Saint Calamity.</p><p>However, there was still a lifetime left. This was only the beginning. There was still hope to contain it or find an opportunity to cross over.</p><p>If everyone’s Saint Calamity were to be stacked together, you would provoke me, and I would mock you. They would only irritate each other and cause the Saint Calamity to be stronger than the previous one.</p><p>To have an intact corpse…</p><p>At that time, it would be an extravagant hope!</p><p>Jiang Buyi watched Mei Siren and Huang Quan leave, but he did not stop them.</p><p>He did not have the ability to stop them because he also had to pass his own Saint Calamity.</p><p>He acted crazily both internally and externally and repeatedly said that he wanted everyone to die together… Jiang Buyi was actually calm in his heart, calmer than a dead person.</p><p>If he could avoid death, he would definitely not want to die.</p><p>What Jiang Buyi really wanted was for Mei Siren and Huang Quan to die.</p><p>It would be best to drag Yu Lingdi with him, but if possible, Yu Lingdi should die at the hands of others.</p><p>Other people’s Saint Calamity had three levels, but he Jiang Buyi had only one level.</p><p>The others were only the higher void and did not have the experience of passing the Demi-Saint’s tribulation. Jiang Buyi was a Demi-Saint and had the experience.</p><p>Jiang Buyi had a higher chance of survival than everyone else present as he had the Lei Family’s Eyes – the Three Tribulation Eyes.</p><p>“Take me away, we can live!”</p><p>At this moment, Yu Lingdi whispered into his ear and brought out an illusion of an illuminated gate.</p><p>A drop of Holy Blood flew out of his fingertip and merged into the illusion of the illuminated gate</p><p>“Secondary plane door edict!”</p><p>There was a buzzing sound.</p><p>The Nine Heavens Thunder Calamity still gathered and formed at this stage.</p><p>Suddenly, a strange phenomenon appeared in the sky as a huge door opened.</p><p>The power of the mysterious Path Principles seemed to surge forward and turn into endless chains that captured the power of the Thunder Calamity and reeled it in.</p><p>With a bang, the door closed tightly, and the phenomenon disappeared.</p><p>All of the tribulation-goers on the Abyss Island, as well as the Spiritual Cultivators who had rushed over to the First Hall of Sins, were completely dumbfounded.</p><p>Because after this phenomenon was formed, only seven out of the ten Thunder Calamity rose.</p><p>The remaining three stages died before they were even formed.</p><p>“Three who ‘transcend the tribulation’ died?”</p><p>“So fast?”</p><p>“Looks like the fight for the treasure is more intense than I imagined!”</p><p>The secondary plane door, the truth was that Yu Lingdi did not dare to take it out until the very last moment.</p><p>Especially in front of Huang Quan and Jiang Buyi.</p><p>As expected, he used his Holy Blood to activate some of the abilities of the secondary plane door.</p><p>Huang Quan, who had flown away, suddenly trembled and then stopped.</p><p>“You brat…”</p><p>From afar, Yu Lingdi could even hear the amazement, shock, and various emotions present in Huang Quan’s words.</p><p>He understood that the information updates from the Five Decays of Heaven and Man were not timely.</p><p>Huang Quan really did not know that he had obtained the secondary plane door. He did not even think that a mere Cutting Path stage would be able to obtain the secondary plane door.</p><p>However, his reaction was also very obvious. Huang Quan recognized the secondary plane door.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>Despite having withstood the three Saint Calamity, Huang Quan flew back with a swish, completely unafraid of death.</p><p>It was as if in his eyes, the secondary plane door was hundreds of times more important than his own life.</p><p>“Stop him!” Yu Lingdi was terrified. “Jiang Buyi, stop him! Run away with me!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
