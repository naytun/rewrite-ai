(2)</p><p>“Brother Chen, oh Brother Chen, you’re so ignorant. The ‘one and only’ is too absolute!”</p><p>“Yu Lingdi might be strong, but his power of the Upanishad is definitely not the only one. You have never seen my Senior Brother… Ugh!”</p><p>Gu Qinger swallowed his words.</p><p>However, he was still not satisfied. He pouted and said unhappily.</p><p>“Number one in the younger generation? That is impossible, my Master… My Junior Brother and I have not even made a move yet. How can he be considered as number one?”</p><p>“Yu Lingdi’s Upanishad might be rare among the younger generation, but it’s definitely not the only one. It’s definitely not the only one on the continent.”</p><p>“In the entire five regions, including the elderly experts… Him? This is it!”</p><p>As Gu Qinger spoke, he reached out his left hand and curled up three fingers in the middle. He placed his thumb on the tip of his little finger and slowly raised his little finger. A sharp sword finger flickered on it.</p><p>“That’s all!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused at his pig-like expression that tried to show disdain.</p><p>This guy’s face was already swollen to such a degree, so why didn’t he stop talking?</p><p>However, he did reveal a lot of information…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at Gu Qingyi suspiciously.</p><p>It was because in Gu Qinger’s eyes, his Senior Brother was omnipotent.</p><p>Or could it be that Gu Qingyi’s strength completely exceeded his imagination and could not be counted among the younger generation at all?</p><p>For someone as strong as Gu Qinger to grasp the ‘Absolute Imperial Control’ at such a young age, and for his Supreme Master to be one of the Seven Sword Deity, Wen Ting… logically speaking, this was an extremely high outlook.</p><p>However, other than the disdain in his words and expression, Gu Qinger obviously admired his Senior Brother from the bottom of his heart!</p><p>This kind of worship didn’t seem at all the brainless type, like that of little Junior Sister.</p><p>It was more like a form of recognition, respect, and reverence for Gu Qingyi’s strength. There were all kinds of emotions.</p><p>“What does Brother Gu want to say?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou ignored Gu Qinger and looked at Gu Qingyi.</p><p>Compared to Gu Qinger’s words that contained some truth, he was more concerned about Yu Lingdi, whom Gu Qing had met before.</p><p>When?</p><p>What happened?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was very curious.</p><p>However, with Chen Shu’s status, it seemed inconvenient for him to ask directly, so he could only beat around the bush.</p><p>Gu Qingyi didn’t think too much about it. He recalled something and said slowly.</p><p>“When I was looking for my Junior Brother, I saw Yu Lingdi in a square outside the First Hall of Sins. He was strung up on a totem pole. He must have hung there for a long time and had been tortured.”</p><p>“When I saw him, he was only slightly conscious.”</p><p>“I tried to save him, but even with my abilities, I couldn’t break the seal that imprisoned him.”</p><p>“After that, I sensed my Junior Brother’s aura, so I left.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>How long had Yu Lingdi been hanging on the Abyss Island?</p><p>No wonder so many major events had happened in the Yunlun Mountain Range, but he had never seen him before. So he had already arrived at the Abyss Island?</p><p>Then the problem was…</p><p>With Yu Lingdi’s abilities , who could have hung him up? Even tortured him?</p><p>He was a Water-type Upanishad. If he couldn’t defeat him, he could simply run away. He could disappear in a flash. Did he meet a Demi-Saint?</p><p>That was not right.</p><p>If the Demi-Saints who were enemies of the Holy Divine Palace really fought, they would not have spared Yu Lingdi’s life. They would not have simply tortured him.</p><p>This could be seen from Jiang Buyi’s attitude towards Teng Shanhai.</p><p>Jiang Buyi, who was ruthless enough to eradicate the root of the problem, was not even opposed to the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>If it was a Demi-Saint who was related to the Holy Divine Palace, then he wouldn’t have fought with Yu Lingdi.</p><p>Yu Lingdi wasn’t Teng Shanhai. He was a smart person and wouldn’t have allowed himself to be played in this manner.</p><p>With his status as the Spirit Division Chief, half of the Demi-Saints in the five domains of the continent would have to give him some face.</p><p>“Who strung him up?” Gu Qinger suddenly asked curiously.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost picked up this pig head and kissed it. You’ve asked what I wanted to ask. Keep it up. Ask more.</p><p>Gu Qingyi shook his head.</p><p>“I don’t know, but it’s obvious that there must be a reason for him to be hung there.”</p><p>“I didn’t think too much about it before, but now that I thought about it, every time an image appeared on Yu Lingdi’s body on the totem pole, there would be a sound from Abyss Island the distance.”</p><p>“There are obviously more people on Abyss Island now.”</p><p>“It’s possible that due to Yu Lingdi being a Water-type Upanishad, he was captured and used as a spiritual source to connect to another outside world…” Gu Qingyi’ s eyes narrowed as he chose his words carefully.</p><p>“Deep sea?” Xu Xiaoshou said.</p><p>Gu Qingyi pointed a finger. His eyes lit up, and he had a look that indicated that he had said what he wanted to say.</p><p>The two of them had a tacit understanding. Almost at the same time, they thought of the ‘water’ in the deep sea and the Water-type Upanishad on the Abyss Island.</p><p>They used the two of the same origin as a connection to provide a spiritual source. Then, the Void Gate could be used as a medium to open the teleportation channel.</p><p>In this way, could the group of people who fell into the deep sea at the bottom of the Lone Cliff really be teleported to the Abyss Island just like that?</p><p>However…</p><p>“Which fierce person could be strong enough to capture Yu Lingdi and use him as a spiritual strength supply source?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had done this kind of inhumane thing once before.</p><p>If nothing unexpected happened, currently, there might be someone surnamed Jiang, who was responsible for the supply of the spiritual strength of the great array!</p><p>And anyone who could capture Yu Lingdi was definitely not a mortal.</p><p>This was linked to the Saint Servant’s motive to summon the Abyss Island, that was beneficial to the Saint Servant.</p><p>Therefore Xu Xiaoshou thought that it should have been done by his own people.</p><p>There were only two candidates left in his mind.</p><p>It could be Water Ghost. Water Ghost was also a Water-type Upanishad, or a higher void. They were stronger than Yu Lingdi. Hiss! Why did these two people have the Water-type Upanishad? Was there any connection?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
