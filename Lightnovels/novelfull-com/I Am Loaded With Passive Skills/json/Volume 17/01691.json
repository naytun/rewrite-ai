(6)</h1><p>1691 Crazy Half-Saint, Three Tribulation Eyes, Buried Together! (6)</p><p>However, if Jiang Buyi rescued Yu Lingdi from the chaos, there was a high probability that the Holy Divine Palace would protect Jiang Buyi after they knew that he had signed a contract with them.</p><p>Rather than that, it was better to let the secret be buried here.</p><p>Let Yu Lingdi die.</p><p>Jiang Buyi would regain his freedom.</p><p>If the Holy Divine Palace didn’t know about the situation, they wouldn’t interfere.</p><p>He Huang Quan, only needed to hang behind Jiang Buyi… In ten days, or within ten days, he would be able to get the head of this Demi-Saint!</p><p>“Jiang Buyi, save me!”</p><p>How could Yu Lingdi not see Huang Quan’s little actions?</p><p>One of his arms and both of his legs had been cut off after Huang Quan rubbed his fingers together.</p><p>When Huang Quan cast a deadly stare at him, Yu Lingdi was suddenly aware of something, and roared out his order.</p><p>An order!</p><p>This was not a plea, but an order from the contract!</p><p>The Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree had been established. As long as Yu Lingdi didn’t die, Jiang Buyi, as a Demi-Saint, could have some freedom under the premise of the completion of the order.</p><p>However, when Yu Lingdi’s powerful roar burst forth, even Jiang Buyi had to obey.</p><p>“D*mned thing!”</p><p>Huang Quan’s fingertips moved again.</p><p>An old figure that exuded a black deathly aura appeared. His hair was disheveled as he stood in front of Yu Lingdi, who had lost both his legs and arms.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s head was still lowered.</p><p>With a loud roar, the Path Principles collapsed and Zhen Huang Palace exploded into pieces..</p><p>Even Huang Quan, who hadn’t attacked yet, felt dizzy under the crazy Demi-Saint’s destructive willpower. He immediately stopped and fled in the opposite direction.</p><p>“Run?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi picked Yu Lingdi up with one hand and glanced at the death countdown that had appeared in his mind once again. He felt that the entire world could be destroyed.</p><p>Huang Quan’s deduction was what Jiang Buyi had planned to do.</p><p>He would let Huang Quan and Mei Siren escape today.</p><p>In a few days, he would die.</p><p>“Saint Guard Restriction!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi raised his hand and clenched it in the air.</p><p>When the Holy Realm was unleashed, it covered almost a thousand miles.</p><p>A black cloud that was barely visible to the naked eye flashed across the First Hall of Sins and turned into a Demi-Saint Stage barrier.</p><p>In the next second, it suddenly shrank!</p><p>Within the Saint Guard Restriction, rules surged and turned into chains of order. They brought back Huang Quan and Mei Siren who had run far away but were unable to escape from Jiang Buyi’s Holy Realm. It trapped them in the ruins of Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Yu Lingdi looked up in shock from Jiang Buyi’s shoulder. He saw the Gold Robe masked man’s fountain in front of him on the left. He punched the barrier of the Saint Guard Restriction.</p><p>However, it was fruitless.</p><p>Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi had attacked with his full strength. If he didn’t die, this domain could not be shattered by a higher void.</p><p>In the next second, Yu Lingdi suddenly saw Huang Quan pull out the Shang Xuan Sword with one hand.</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>Mei Siren did the same.</p><p>His sword image had been mobilized to the extreme, and the vigorous Sword Will on his body almost went wild. He also did not care if this attack would be too powerful, and then he would be subject to the death countdown again.</p><p>At this moment, Yu Lingdi could sense no less than four types of Ancient Sword Techniques from Mei Siren.</p><p>“Crazy.”</p><p>“They’re all crazy!”</p><p>How could Jiang Buyi not see what Yu Lingdi saw?</p><p>His saint’s will swept across the two sides of the sky and saw that they used their own methods to break through the Saint Guard Restriction barrier that he had summoned.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s shoulders trembled as he lowered his eyes and smiled. The corners of his mouth curled into a ferocious arc.</p><p>He reached into his arms.</p><p>He took out the black and red Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree!</p><p>At this moment, Huang Quan and Mei Siren didn’t turn around, but their bodies froze.</p><p>“If you can run…”</p><p>“I will take your surname.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi threw the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree into the sky and it ripped apart in mid-air.</p><p>“Gather!”</p><p>All things in the world are mainly black in color.</p><p>When there are no words, everything vanishes.</p><p>When the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree was fully unleashed, even if Huang Quan accelerated the time and used the Shang Xuan Sword to cut open the barrier of the Saint Guard Restriction…</p><p>However, he had forgotten his original intention to escape.</p><p>With a swish, Huang Quan flashed in front of Jiang Buyi.</p><p>Mei Siren’s sword image wielded the Azure Mo Swords. The four realms of Wan, Mo, Xin, and Wu were activated at the same time. They shattered the Saint Guard Restriction that could not be broken by any attack below the Demi-Saint Realm.</p><p>However, he had also forgotten what to do next.</p><p>With a swish, Mei Siren appeared in front of Jiang Buyi.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>The world fell silent!</p><p>Yu Lingdi, who was half-lying on Jiang Buyi’s shoulder, only felt a light shadow flash in front of him.</p><p>Huang Quan and Mei Siren were both ahead.</p><p>The two of them looked at Jiang Buyi, whose hair was disheveled and whose head was lowered.</p><p>As for Jiang Buyi…</p><p>Yes!</p><p>This guy had never raised his head since he appeared.</p><p>He kept his head down. No matter how great the battle was, and even when the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree was used, he never raised his head.</p><p>But at this moment.</p><p>Jiang Buyi suddenly looked up!</p><p>Yu Lingdi tilted his head and looked across…</p><p>What a hideous face!</p><p>The corners of his lips had cracked open, and his fangs pierced into his flesh. The flesh on his face bloomed as it emitted a dense aura of calamity.</p><p>The most eye-catching sight was the thing embedded in Jiang Buyi’s eyes, deep between his brows…Three eyes!</p><p>Yes, that was right.</p><p>It wasn’t two eyes, but three!</p><p>The three eyeballs were identical, and they all emitted a dense aura of calamity.</p><p>There were three blood-colored flowers, dark and dim and they swiveled rapidly.</p><p>When the three eyes met with Huang Quan, Mei Siren, and Yu Lingdi, the three blood-colored flowers flowed into the pupils and vanished.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
