(3)</p><p>“Da!”</p><p>Just as he was about to make a move, he heard footsteps coming from the corner in front of him, and a figure turned around.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou already had a phobia. He had yet to meet any good person in the First Hall of Sins, so he quickly turned and looked over.</p><p>A swordsman dressed in white walked out from the dark mist.</p><p>Even though the First Hall of Sins was in chaos due to all the on-going battles, this person was spotless and his steps were light.</p><p>He held a sword in his arms. This sword was wrapped tightly in a sealing belt. It was impossible to see even a little of the might contained within.</p><p>Gu Qingyi!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou recognized the person and almost cried.</p><p>He had finally met a normal person, and a person of the same generation-a young man!</p><p>Was this so easy? The last peer he saw was controlled by a Boss, and now it was unknown if he lived or died. This one…</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>Why was Gu Qingyi here?</p><p>Gu Qinger was also here…</p><p>At their age, shouldn’t they be training in the Yunlun Mountain Range?</p><p>When he thought of these three swordsmen, Xu Xiaoshou recalled the Burial Sword Tomb and the Seven Sword Deity Wen Ting. He also thought of the good relationship between Wen Ting and Bazhun’an.</p><p>Ally?</p><p>“Ancient Swordsman?”</p><p>At this time, Gu Qingyi stopped a little way ahead. He was vigilant as he kept a safe distance where he could draw his sword at any time. He frowned and asked, “Who is your Master?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>He carefully searched through his memories and found that the number of times he had seen Gu Qingyi attack could be counted on one finger.</p><p>This guy was quite fierce!</p><p>I have ‘Stealth’. I don’t even have a sword on me, and I didn’t even use any moves. How could he even know that I’m an Ancient Swordsman?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of Gu Qinger, who had mastered the ‘Absolute Imperial Control’ and felt that he couldn’t treat Gu Qingyi like any normal young man.</p><p>In a group of three, there had to be someone who the others could rely on, right?</p><p>They represented the Seven Sword Deity Wen Ting from the Burial Sword Tomb, so there had to be a true genius among them.</p><p>“I’m Chen Shu.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded and said, “I’m from the Feng family in the Southern Region.</p><p>“Gu Qingyi.”</p><p>“I recognize you. You’re one of the three swordsmen from the Burial Sword Tomb. Is the sword in your hand the famed sword, the Demonic Sword Yeulian?”</p><p>“Yes,”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s interest was piqued, and he even forgot about the death countdown.</p><p>In the past, he didn’t know anything about the 21 Famed Swords, nor did he know anything about the Ancient Swordsman’s sword techniques, Sword Flow and Way of the Sword.</p><p>Now that his status had risen, he already understood the value of the Famed Sword and also understood the importance of the Seven Sword Deity Wen Ting’s first disciple.</p><p>He had a lot of questions to ask.</p><p>For example, when he encountered the eldest of the three Gu brothers, Xu Xiaoshou, was very curious about the sword techniques he had learned.</p><p>Bazhun’an had a disciple called Xiao Kongtong. You, Gu Qingyi, are a little young, but you’ve been cultivating the sword technique for a long time and have a good master. You should have mastered quite a few realms of sword techniques, right?</p><p>I, Chen Shu, have mastered two major realms. What about you?</p><p>Before he could ask any of these questions, he saw Gu Qing Yi spread his hands after he finished speaking, and the Demonic Sword Yue Lian flew out from his arms.</p><p>Gu Qingyi grasped the demonic sword in one hand, his eyes cold, and his killing intent erupted.</p><p>“Would you like to have a taste of my sword?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned, and the next second, a message box popped up in the Information Bar.</p><p>“+(Locked-on. Passive Points+)+1.”</p><p>“+(Threatened. Passive Points+)+1.”</p><p>“+(Ambushed. Passive Points +)+1.”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, nine illusionary sword shadows flew out of Gu Qingyi’s body.</p><p>The sword shadows suddenly enlarged as they moved forward. They scattered in a well-arranged pattern and formed a sword array, that fanned out in all directions.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>With a loud explosion, the labyrinth’s walls within a one-mile radius shattered into pieces instantly after being suppressed by the Nine Swords.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils trembled.</p><p>He had tested the strength of the labyrinth’s walls with his physical body…</p><p>It wasn’t over yet. After the Nine Swords fanned into a formation, the void behind Gu Qingyi cracked and turned into countless illusory small swords.</p><p>With a soft whooshing sound, the countless small swords spread out in a fan-shaped formation, as if tens of thousands of swords were in the state of worship. The tips of all the swords were aimed in Xu Xiaoshou’s direction.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The moment Gu Qingyi’s aura took shape, Xu Xiaoshou’s body suddenly sank, and his feet were pressed into the ground.</p><p>Aura…</p><p>This guy, he’s actually faster than me?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded.</p><p>Among the younger generation, I thought that only Yu Lingdi could be my opponent. I didn’t expect you to be that strong as well.</p><p>Everything that Gu Qingyi did seemed to be done in passing, and it didn’t affect his movements at all.</p><p>After he picked up the sword, he kicked the lower hem of his robe with his right foot and tilted his body. As he held the opening of the scabbard with his right hand, he gently stretched out his thumb and pressed it against the hilt of the Demonic Sword Yuelian.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>The melodious sound of sword cries rang in everyone’s minds.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt like he was in another world. He found that the environment around him had not changed, but everything else had changed.</p><p>There was a heightened quality to everything. Dust, gravel, air… They all targeted him as they released their malicious intent and showed off their sharpness.</p><p>“(Imprisoned. Passive Points+) +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried to move his body, but he found that he seemed to be stuck in a quagmire, and found it even difficult to lift his hand.</p><p>When he saw how Gu Qingyi held his sword at the hilt, something flickered in Xu Xiaoshou’s mind. He recalled the scene in the White Cave and the Lijian Grassland.</p><p>At that time, the Vicious Sword, Fourth Sword, had just been created, and countless people were fighting for it. They were all overcome by the vicious devilish sword energy of Fourth Sword.</p><p>However, the man in front of him had only brandished the sword body of the Demonic Sword Yuelian that was two fingers wide. With a single strike, he had shattered the sword energy of the Fourth Sword and even cut the void in half.</p><p>At that time, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know about the power of Gu Qingyi’s sword.</p><p>Now, he understood that when the previous and current Gu Qingyi, used the Fourth Sword, even the higher void would have to avoid him.</p><p>And this guy, in the White Cave, was able to cut off the vicious devilish sword energy with his Fourth Sword, singlehandedly.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou found that he could still talk, and he could tell that Gu Qingyi was a gentleman.</p><p>He didn’t kill him directly. He seemed to have this battle etiquette that belonged to the Ancient Swordsman. Once he nodded, this guy would then attack.</p><p>Would Xu Xiaoshou want to go into battle?</p><p>He was just curious, but he didn’t want to fight with Gu Qingyi.</p><p>“What are you doing? Why did you suddenly want to kill me?” However, the killing intent from the other party did not seem to be fake. Xu Xiaoshou even suspected that there was a grudge between Gu Qingyi and Chen Shu, a life-and-death grudge.</p><p>But Chen Shu…</p><p>Damn it, he had just created this avatar and hadn’t even changed his face yet!</p><p>I, Chen Shu, am innocent, okay!</p><p>Gu Qingyi’s sword-like eyes were sharp and cold, “You have the aura of my Junior Brother about you. Anyone who touched my Junior Brother will be killed no matter how far away they are.”</p><p>“Your Junior Brother?” Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment before he finally reacted.</p><p>The corners of his mouth twitched in anger. He tried his best to raise his hand and point to the other side.</p><p>“If there are no surprises, your Junior Brother should be lying there now… I! Chen Shu! I just saved his life!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
