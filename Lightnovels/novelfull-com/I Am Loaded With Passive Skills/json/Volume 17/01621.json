(1)</p><p>“Chirp, chirp, chirp.”</p><p>Before the person made an appearance, a strange laugh echoed throughout.</p><p>After the great array in Zheng Huang Palace froze and cracked, a thick layer of frosty mist seeped through the cracks and finally turned into a solid figure.</p><p>This person…</p><p>How should he put it? There was only one word to describe his appearance – tragic!</p><p>His entire body was pitch-black and covered in dried blackish-red blood stains. A faint smell of charred flesh emanated from his body.</p><p>His messy hair as well as the hairs on his body stood upright. He was the epitome of what it meant to be ‘Bohemian’ in a different sense!</p><p>At first glance, other than the few tattered strips of cloth that hung limply on his body, he looked like a creature that had walked out of a pile of charcoal.</p><p>Other than that, his entire body was covered in wounds, as if he had been slashed or stabbed by a sharp weapon.</p><p>The most serious injury appeared to be in his left hand.</p><p>The person’s left forearm was broken at the elbow. The wound was wrapped in Holy Power. No blood dripped, but no new flesh grew either.</p><p>“Elder Han!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart trembled.</p><p>He could no longer recognize this unhuman-like fellow who had been so savagely struck by lightning by his appearance.</p><p>However, that familiar ice-type power, that frosty white mist, that Demi-Saint aura… In the entire First Hall of Sins, perhaps only Elder Han, whom he had met in the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes, was a match for this person.</p><p>“Oh, there’s a young man here?”</p><p>The ‘thunder man’ Elder Han swaggered over from outside the hall; his tone was very carefree and optimistic.</p><p>It was as if the injuries on its body were actually on another person. His soul was currently soaking in the hot springs in Heaven and he thrived in this happiness and freedom.</p><p>“Good man, give me some clothes to wear!”</p><p>Elder Han casually tore off the tattered black rags on his body as he sauntered in.</p><p>His originally fluffy white tail had now turned into a blackened mass and looked like a spiked club. It was hard and straight, and it struggled to twist itself around and barely covered the vital parts.</p><p>The Gu brothers were dumbstruck.</p><p>They could hardly believe their eyes.</p><p>However, he didn’t have any of the airs of a Demi-Saint at all. He didn’t even mete out any punishment to these people after they saw his ‘honorable’ appearance.</p><p>This was such a contrast to a Demi-Saint who would release the Heaven and Earth phenomenon to scare others.</p><p>“What are you waiting for? Clothes! You don’t understand what clothes are? A robe! Anything to cover up this shameful state!”</p><p>Elder Han cursed as he finally walked into the great hall.</p><p>From time to time, there would be electric currents that flowed through his body. Every time this happened, he would twitch and pause, but this did not affect his carefree and unruly nature.</p><p>“D*mn it, my eyes are about to be blinded. I thought it was just an afterimage, but there are actually three people here…”</p><p>Elder Han muttered as he walked nearer to them. He wanted to use his left hand to rub his eyes, but he realized that his left hand ended at his elbow. It was way too short.</p><p>He spat unhappily and switched to his right hand.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was silent for a moment before he skillfully threw out a set of clothes from the spatial barrier.</p><p>After Elder Han put it on casually, he rinsed his face with ice water. Only then did he seem to have a clear view of everything in the hall. Then, his eyes turned solemn, and the air turned frigid.</p><p>“Little chap! Ancient Swordsman? Or two?”</p><p>His tone was not amiable. On the contrary, it was filled with hatred and resentment!</p><p>Gu Qingyi’s vigilance was raised to the highest level. A small dark sword had already appeared in his eyes. It slowly approached his glabella and merged into a red color.</p><p>One could tell from his tone, that this uninvited Demi-Saint who had the Void Crystals to freedom hated the Ancient Swordsman!</p><p>As expected…</p><p>“I absolutely hate all you Ancient Swordsman. D*mn the lot of you! Ancient Swordsman, go to hell!”</p><p>“Chirp, chirp, chirp!”</p><p>Elder Han’s face twisted as he screamed in anger. He bent his knees and jumped into the sky and suddenly attacked without any reason!</p><p>He raised his one and a half hands and half of the ice wings that covered part of the sky behind his back spread out with a bang. A strong Ghost Beast aura emanated from his body.</p><p>The ice wings were wrapped in endless Holy Power. They spread out thoroughly and swept forward.</p><p>“Madman!”</p><p>Gu Qinger did not even think about it. After he cursed angrily, he charged forward.</p><p>His Sword Will erupted and countless golden swords appeared in the void. They seemed prepared to meet the Demi-Saint without any fear of death.</p><p>“Eldest Senior Brother, leave first. I’ll break it…”</p><p>“Break my ass, back off!”</p><p>Gu Qingyi held his sword with one hand and grabbed his junior brother by the neck with the other and threw him back.</p><p>At the same time, a blood-red dot bloomed between his eyebrows. His body buzzed and Holy Power fluctuations also surged out.</p><p>“Senior Sword Demon, please lend a hand.”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Elder Han’s ice wings slashed down from the sky like a blade and caused the space to explode.</p><p>In the next second, under the power of the black Ghost Beast and the ice-blue Demi-Saint’s Power, accompanied by the clanging sound of sword cries, ten sword lights shot out.</p><p>“Swish… Swish… Swish…”</p><p>The sword light was like a shadow, formless and intangible as it slashed through the void.</p><p>At the critical moment, Elder Han finally reacted. This young man in front of him didn’t seem to be someone to be trifled with.</p><p>However, it was very difficult for him to stop his raging full-powered attack. That kind of sword light did not seem to be something that a junior of this level could come out with. It was completely unexpected!</p><p>“What the hell is this?”</p><p>His body had just shifted to the side when a loud explosion sounded. Elder Han’s ice wings turned from offense to defense and hurriedly blocked the space in front of him. However, they were still cut into pieces in an instant.</p><p>The sword light pierced through the ice shards that had instantly formed and ruthlessly slashed at Elder Han’s body.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
