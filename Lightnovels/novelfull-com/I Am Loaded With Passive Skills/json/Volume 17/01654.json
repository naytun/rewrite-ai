You have to live! Tell me, what is the key to cultivating the immortal body?”</p><p>“It’s you…”</p><p>“Me?”</p><p>“I don’t… know…”</p><p>Pain and struggle appeared in Ye Xiao’s eyes again.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man quieted down and fell into deep thought. “If you possessed me, would you be able to pass the saint calamity and survive?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face turned pale as he listened. He could not understand the intention of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man at all.</p><p>Was this guy a pervert?</p><p>What was he trying to do?</p><p>He even wanted Ye Xiao to possess him?</p><p>Was he crazy?</p><p>“I didn’t, the semi-saint person…” Ye Xiao spoke.</p><p>“If you were a semi-saint person and succeeded in possessing me after transcending the tribulation, how could I have survived?” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man sneered and said.</p><p>He shook his head and took back the Blood World Pearl. Finally, he asked softly, “So what’s your answer? If you possess me, can you be resurrected?”</p><p>“A slim chance…”</p><p>“This is enough!”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man suddenly moved.</p><p>He grabbed the Blood World Pearl and pried open the mouth of the three-legged black owl. Then, he forcefully stuffed the Blood World Pearl, which was slightly too large compared to the size of Ye Xiao, into the mouth of the thin black owl.</p><p>“Ow!”</p><p>Ye Xiao was in pain.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s eyes were vicious as he gave the final order.</p><p>“Transcend the tribulation! Now!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s scalp went numb.</p><p>Was he really planning to carry out whatever lousy plan of his?</p><p>Ye Xiao had clearly said that she didn’t have the qualification of a semi-saint person. If she were to forcefully transcend the tribulation at this moment, the consequences could be imagined.</p><p>More importantly, the eerie and evil Blood World Pearl had been forcefully stuffed into Ye Xiao’s mouth by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>The changes that this could bring in the end would definitely be a disaster, right?</p><p>The source of disaster, the guidance of death…</p><p>Recalling the words of the Heavenly Five Decays of Heaven and Man, Xu Xiaoshou only felt that this madman might also want to force himself towards a dead end.</p><p>He must have thought about it. Perhaps the guidance of death could not only guide Ye Xiao, but also him, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, right?</p><p>But…</p><p>If he made physical contact with the Blood World Pearl without a protection barrier, he would be able to see the scene of his future death.</p><p>What did the Five Decays of Heaven and Man see when he came into contact with the Blood World Pearl?</p><p>Was it because he saw something that he dared to risk his life and go through such a dangerous process?</p><p>But why did it have to come to this?</p><p>In Xu Xiaoshou’s opinion, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was already strong enough with the Body of Decay, the Three Loathsome Eyes, and the Blood World Pearl</p><p>He was invincible under the demi-saint Realm, and he could kill those above the demi-saint at the price of his own life…</p><p>This was the Five Decays of Heaven and Man!</p><p>What did he want from so many plans and actions?</p><p>From Xu Xiaoshou’s perspective, the plan of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man showed no signs of rationality during the cooperation in fighting against the enemy. Rather, it seemed like a path of self-destruction with no regard for the consequences.</p><p>He was just courting death!</p><p>Ye Xiao received the instruction of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man to transcend the saint calamity, and he resisted it almost instinctively.</p><p>Even if there was interference from the power of the Three Loathsome Eyes, he was without the semi-saint person, plus he was not well prepared, was in a weak state, and was full of bad luck, and so on.</p><p>Due to the self-defense mechanism of a peak higher void level cultivator, every part of Ye Xiao’s body was resisting the command to transcend the tribulation issued by the brain.</p><p>However, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man did not care.</p><p>With a boom, the colossal Lord of Calamity appeared from behind his waist again. It turned into the Qi of decay and was injected into the eyes, ears, mouth, and nose of Ye Xiao without any explanation.</p><p>“Uh, uh, uh…”</p><p>Ye Xiao had completely wilted.</p><p>“Transcend the tribulation!”</p><p>Under the command of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, the surface of Ye Xiao’s body emitted a red light. It was as if at this moment, the Blood World Pearl was also guiding her toward death.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>The dull wings with withered black feathers flapped, and Ye Xiao flew into the sky.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suppressed his breathing and felt that his soul was, just like Ye Xiao at the moment, also tightly grasped by the neck by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, and he could not move freely.</p><p>He squinted his eyes and looked up at Ye Xiao’s movements.</p><p>Before he could see any unusual phenomenon, a familiar fluctuation spread out from the surrounding heaven and earth.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>A faint aura of calamity spread out from the ground.</p><p>This aura carried a foul stench that was completely different from Rao Yaoyao’s tribulation in the Ganges River. It was filled with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s tribulation and the smell of death.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>A bolt of black lightning flashed across the sky. It did not light up the darkness of the First Hall of Sins, but it added a sense of gloom to the scene.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t imagine how Ye Xiao, who was full of bad luck, almost devoid of vitality breath, had a world-destroying Blood World Pearl in her stomach, and even had her thoughts controlled, could transcend the saint calamity.</p><p>He couldn’t understand the actions of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man at all!</p><p>However, all of this was happening in an orderly manner…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>After Rao Yaoyao’s saint calamity, another loud rumble was heard on Abyss Island, attracting the attention of all the non-natives on the island.</p><p>“Is someone else going to become a Saint again?”</p><p>“Bazhun’an is truly reliable. This Abyss Island is filled with the foundational roots of Saint Ascension. Why haven’t I encountered any yet?”</p><p>This saint calamity was very different from the others.</p><p>Calamity clouds began to gather and the sky darkened. The elegant god of death replaced all the colors in the world and slowly handed over the invitation to the tribulation transcenders for a banquet.</p><p>“Crack, crack, crack!”</p><p>Black thunder slithered in the sky, and the ground began to crack.</p><p>The aura of death spread, threatening to engulf the First Hall of Sins. Even Abyss Island and the giant kingdom were affected.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
