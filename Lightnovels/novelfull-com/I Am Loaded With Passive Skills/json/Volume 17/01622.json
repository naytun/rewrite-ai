(2)</h1><p>1622 The Ten Crippled Sword Ghost, The Brutal Combat Strength of the Past Era! (2)</p><p>“Ji!”</p><p>Screams rang out.</p><p>Elder Han’s body was directly slashed by the sword light, and he was drenched in blood.</p><p>Fortunately, the ice wings had already blocked most of the damage. He was not killed instantly by the ten sword lights. He was only hurled through the walls of the great hall by the high-intensity slashing power; he smashed through the great array outside the hall, and was flung into an unknown place in the void.</p><p>“Peng… peng… peng…”</p><p>Through the cracks in Zhen Huang Palace’s great array, one could hear the sounds of the countless number of the labyrinth walls being smashed by Elder Han.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>He didn’t want to stop him, he wanted to see what Gu Qingyi could do.</p><p>If Gu Qingyi couldn’t block it, he would naturally step up to stop this chaotic battle.</p><p>But…</p><p>Elder Han!</p><p>A Demi-Saint Ghost Beast!</p><p>His furious attack was shattered by Gu Qingyi and even he was blasted out of the great hall’s spiritual array?</p><p>There seemed to be a shadow above his head…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked up in a daze. He finally saw what the thing that had sent Elder Han flying was.</p><p>It was a ferocious humanoid gray monster that was more than three feet tall. It had pointy ears like an elf, no eyebrows, and only one eye. Its bloodied mouth was wide open and revealed sharp fangs.</p><p>It wore a tattered white prison uniform. It was a crumpled sleeveless long shirt that was so long that it covered its thighs and exposed its limbs. There were no pants.</p><p>The reason why he knew it was a prisoner’s uniform was because the word ‘prisoner’ was emblazoned on it in black against a white background.</p><p>The most shocking thing was not the appearance of the strange humanoid creature, but the ten bloody wounds on its body and the ten ragged, rusty swords stuck in the wounds!</p><p>Some were long swords, some were short swords, some were giant swords, some were thin swords…</p><p>Some of these swords were pierced through its chest, some were stuck under its ribs, some extended from its right palm, and some were stuck in its knees.</p><p>There were three swords stabbed into its back, and there was another one below its head!</p><p>“This is… What the hell is this?” Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth was dry.</p><p>This savage Sword Demon had the strongest Sword Will he had ever seen!</p><p>It was a stark difference from Master Siren’s restraint. It was completely presumptuous and did not attempt to cover up at all. It was simply the only representative of the most ferocious and unsheathed blade!</p><p>“Brat Gu, one move, one spiritual sword. Do you remember?” The Sword Demon lowered its single eye to look at Gu Qingyi.</p><p>Gu Qinger shivered and cowered in the background and did not dare to speak. There was only fear in his eyes as he looked at the Sword Demon. It appeared as if he had been ruthlessly dealt with by this monster before.</p><p>“Of course I remember.”</p><p>Gu Qingyi took out a grade one spiritual sword from his spatial ring almost at the speed of light and respectfully handed it over with both hands.</p><p>The Sword Demon’s right arm that had a sword extended from its palm did not move. It used its other hand that only had three fingers to grab the grade one spiritual sword and drew it toward itself.</p><p>“Ka! Crack! Ka!”</p><p>It slowly bit off the grade one spiritual sword, one piece at a time… It then swallowed it!</p><p>Swallowed?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gasped.</p><p>How could he not know how tough and strong this grade one spiritual sword was?</p><p>But it was this thing that the Sword Demon had chewed off with just a bite of its teeth. Had it really swallowed and digested it?</p><p>“Gu brat, when do you think you will give me the evil sword? As long as you give it to me and let me eat it, I’ll do whatever you want.”</p><p>The Sword Demon grinned as it spoke and chewed slowly, its face filled with satisfaction as if it had just tasted the greatest delicacy in the world.</p><p>“Senior must be joking. I don’t even have that many grade one spiritual swords, what more for Yue Lian.”</p><p>Gu Qingyi seemed to be very afraid of the Sword Demon as well. He tightened his grip on the evil sword and added, “Yue Lian is my Supreme Master’s saber. You don’t have to think about it.”</p><p>“Didn’t he already give it to you? What he gave away is no longer his!”</p><p>The Sword Demon laughed out loud as it swallowed the spiritual sword fragments and the hilt before it turned to look at Gu Qinger, who was curled up in a corner.</p><p>“Second Brother Gu, what about you? When do you plan to present me with a gift? Your junior brother has already given his away. Aren’t you going to show some gratitude?” It stared at the Blood Sword, Bewitching Demon on Gu Qinger’s back.</p><p>“Dream on! Bullshit!”</p><p>“My junior brother didn’t give it away. You snatched it openly!”</p><p>“You hungry ghost, you robber! I won’t give you The Bewitching Demon even if I die!”</p><p>“If you dare to threaten me again, I’ll tell Supreme Master that I can’t beat you. I’ll get him to deal with you!” Gu Qinger looked fierce on the outside but was weak on the inside.</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>The Sword Demon laughed bitterly as it looked intently into Second Brother’s eyes before it looked away.</p><p>It suddenly turned around and stared at Xu Xiaoshou. It bent down and almost wrapped its bloody mouth around Xu Xiaoshou’s head.</p><p>“Brat, what are you looking at!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could clearly see the mucus on the Sword Demon’s broken sword as it spoke and he caught a whiff of the refreshing ‘fragrance’, as well.</p><p>“Slightly…”</p><p>In the end, he could not hold it in anymore. After he turned and retched, he hurriedly moved away.</p><p>“You brat…” The Sword Demon’s eyes narrowed. “Why do I smell a familiar scent from you? Yes, there is…”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>When the crack in Zhen Huang Palace’s great array closed, the frosty white mist finally reappeared.</p><p>Elder Han’s return broke the Sword Demon’s train of thought, accompanied by Elder Han’s strange cry.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
