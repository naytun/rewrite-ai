(4)</h1><p>1620 The Master of Void Island, the Door of the Secondary Plane! (4)</p><p>“Brother Chen, what is the Outer island? Is Sky City divided into these?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t laugh anymore. He pursed his lips and glanced at Gu Qingyi. He shook his head slightly but did not elaborate any further.</p><p>Gu Qingyi was right.</p><p>There was no benefit to have too much knowledge. In fact, it was a shorter route to death.</p><p>It seemed that Wen Ting of Burial Sword Tomb was a normal person. He knew how to separate the information and only Gu Qingyi was aware of it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a little uncomfortable.</p><p>The biggest reason was not because he did not have 10,000 Void Crystals. It was because among the top ten list of Zhen Huang Palace, 90% were gray and only one was shiny.</p><p>Unfortunately, the door to the secondary plane was also gray.</p><p>“What does grey represent?” Although he already had the answer in his heart, Xu Xiaoshou still asked the giant statue.</p><p>“It has been… exchanged by…”</p><p>As expected, the reply made his heart sink.</p><p>“Who exchanged it?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>The giant statue didn’t answer. Its eyes narrowed and it remained silent for a long time.</p><p>“Then when was it exchanged? You can at least tell me, right? Show me some compassion…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wondered who had the secondary plane door this time, or whether it had been lost and nowhere to be found.</p><p>If this thing had been exchanged by someone in ancient times, it would not have been a bad thing. There was a high chance that this thing would have been listed on the Inscription Stele and was one of the legendary lost Divine Instrument.</p><p>The giant statue suddenly looked up and spoke!</p><p>“One day… before…”</p><p>F*ck!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes widened.</p><p>“Who was it? Who exchanged it?”</p><p>The statue closed its eyes and didn’t say anything more.</p><p>Gu Qingyi was also shocked. “The secondary plane door was exchanged a day ago. This meant that the Abyss Island would be sent back to the space-time fragment by the person who exchanged it. At that time, it will be very difficult for us to return to the Shengshen Continent…”</p><p>“How can that be? I haven’t brought little junior sister back to Burial Sword Tomb. Gu Qingsan is so unreliable, how can I let him escort little junior sister back alone?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>Ah, this…</p><p>How did the topic change to that?</p><p>He looked at the more reliable Gu Qingyi and started to discuss with him. “Not necessarily. The function of the secondary plane door is so powerful. Perhaps the price to use it is also very high. In the short term, the Abyss Island will not be shut down.”</p><p>“Don’t forget, that person was able to gather 10,000 Void Crystals!” Gu Qingyi was very rational.</p><p>To be able to gather 10,000 Void Crystals in such a short time, who was this person?</p><p>Even a Demi-Saint might not be able to gather that many!</p><p>The person who managed to exchange the secondary plane door was definitely a capable person!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fell silent.</p><p>Gu Qingyi was right.</p><p>If someone really managed to do something that even he found inconceivable, then that person was definitely not someone to be trifled with.</p><p>Who could have done that?</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man?</p><p>No, he probably didn’t have that much energy to gather 10,000 Void Crystals in such a short period of time…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought about it and felt that it was impossible to gather 10,000 Void Crystals in only a few days.</p><p>Suddenly, he patted his head, and a spiritual light flashed.</p><p>“What if it had not been a short-term period?”</p><p>What if someone had sneaked into the Abyss Island and collected the Void Crystals over the years just to exchange for this secondary plane door… Was there such a possibility?</p><p>There was!</p><p>There was only one possibility!</p><p>This person who did this would not be chastised by the Holy Divine Palace for doing this. Perhaps he even had their support…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stopped thinking about this matter.</p><p>He looked around and saw that the great hall of Zhen Huang Palace was clean and tidy. There were some small puddles that were about to dry up outside the hall, and they rippled slightly in the breeze.</p><p>“Ta!”</p><p>In the extremely humid environment, water droplets dripped from the beams of the hall.</p><p>The crisp sound resounded in Xu Xiaoshou’s mind and made his heart turn cold.</p><p>“Who did you think of?” Gu Qingyi looked up and felt that Brother Chen had found an answer.</p><p>“I hope what I had not thought of would still be wrong.” Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and didn’t say anything.</p><p>Gu Qingyi did not probe any further.</p><p>Brother Chen didn’t say anything, but his expression showed that it wasn’t a good thing to know too much.</p><p>It would be impolite to continue to ask!</p><p>“Tell me, what kind of ability do you have that can keep a person in suspense? So who did you think it was?” Gu Qinger stomped his feet anxiously at the side. It was so unsafe for little junior sister to be escorted by little junior brother alone!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>Gu Qingyi was also speechless.</p><p>Just when the two of them were so stunned, the great array outside the hall suddenly cracked and a loud laugh could be heard.</p><p>“Sin! I have the 10,000 Void Crystals. If you know what’s good for you, hurry up and hand over the secondary plane door!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
