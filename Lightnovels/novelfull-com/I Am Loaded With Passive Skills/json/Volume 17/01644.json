Take a look at the countdown to exile in your mind!”</p><p>Of course, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man feared the Demi-Saint.</p><p>However, was Jiang Buyi crazy? Did he not know how much time he had left?</p><p>Even if he had obtained the God Devil Eyes, Jiang Buyi could only defend himself with a few waves of attacks.</p><p>Once his countdown to exile was up and he was sent to the Inner Island, what use would the God Devil Eyes be? Would he ever have a chance to enjoy it?</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man could not understand Jiang Buyi’s actions.</p><p>This was something beyond his understanding of Jiang Buyi. The other party should be someone who was calm and rational.</p><p>“I am crazy!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi bristled with anger. The colorful flowing clouds gathered and formed a human face. There were demonic patterns around it. The face was covered with black bulging veins and had a ferocious and terrifying look.</p><p>“She came with me and she belongs to me. No one can take her away!”</p><p>“I am here, and my words are absolute. Who would dare to disobey?”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Jiang Buyi gathered the colorful flowing clouds into his fists and smashed the air.</p><p>The aura of the peak holy will was completely released at this moment, and tremors shook the entire First Hall of Sins.</p><p>The holy realm took shape with a swish and surrounded everyone present.</p><p>It wasn’t hard to see that at this moment, Jiang Buyi actually had the intention to kill everyone who had witnessed the appearance of the God Devil Eyes. This was to prevent any future problems.</p><p>“You are really crazy…”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man looked up and saw that half of the immortal colored flowing clouds had been dyed black by the devilish energy.</p><p>He knew that Jiang Buyi, who had not cleared the power of Demon God from his body immediately after the appearance of the God Devil Eyes, had been affected to some extent.</p><p>“Jiang Buyi!” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man raised his head and shouted.</p><p>A loud roar that didn’t sound human at all came from the void, and the human face that was formed from the colorful clouds looked over.</p><p>With a whoosh, spiritual light gathered and gray fog entered his eyes.</p><p>The three gray flowers in the right eye of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man flipped again and met the face without any hesitation.</p><p>“Wu!” With a muffled groan, the other party had not made any major move yet, but the body of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man trembled and the aura that covered his body became a bit dispirited.</p><p>More than half of the spiritual source in his body seemed to have been sucked dry at this moment. He was so weak that even his right eye started to bleed.</p><p>However, the backlash was so severe that it meant that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s action had succeeded.</p><p>He had successfully controlled Jiang Buyi, who had been blinded by anger and had become slightly moronic due to the devilish energy.</p><p>“Take a look at your countdown to exile, Demi-Saint Jiang!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi felt dizzy as he subconsciously probed the restriction within the depths of his consciousness.</p><p>“Countdown to exile: Three days.”</p><p>Just the word ‘three’ made Jiang Buyi regain his senses.</p><p>He suddenly woke up and restrained all the strength in his body. He immediately shut down the sacred physique that had been liberated. The immortal colored flowing clouds turned into a human form and returned to the ground.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s face turned red instantly. He started to deal with the crazy devilish energy that wreaked havoc in his tendons, bones, and meridians, like a fatal poison.</p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man cursed in his heart before he resumed his attack. An air of decay surrounded him and he grabbed Mu Zixi back.</p><p>“You!” Jiang Buyi suddenly looked up and almost lost control again.</p><p>But this time, he held it in and tried to coax him nicely, “Five Decays of Heaven and Man, I’ll agree to anything you want, but return this puppet to me first.”</p><p>Puppet?</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was stunned for a moment, and then a smile appeared in his eyes.</p><p>“You should kill Ye Xiao first. If she is still alive, she would confirm the charge that the Northern Region Puxuan Jiang Clan had colluded with the descendant of the Lei Family’s God Devil Eyes.”</p><p>“You…” Jiang Buyi choked once again.</p><p>He wasn’t stupid enough to believe that this Taboo Puppet was really a remnant of the Lei family after he heard what the Five Decays of Heaven and Man said.</p><p>However, ever since that incident in the deep sea, Rao Yaoyao had misunderstood him because of Situ Yongren.</p><p>This time, Ye Xiao personally saw that a little girl he brought with him had shown the God Devil Eyes. No matter how much he, Jiang Buyi, tried to deny it, he could not do so.</p><p>But…</p><p>Ye Xiao was the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s enemy, not his!</p><p>Jiang Buyi did not want to be that blade at all.</p><p>When Teng Shanhai died, he had been reminded by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man that he had been used.</p><p>However, there was no other way. Teng Shanhai had to be killed. Jiang Buyi could not bear it and did not dare to not eradicate the source.</p><p>And now?</p><p>Now, would he be used by others again, or by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man?</p><p>Oh, I had to be the bad guy. You, Five Decays of Heaven and Man have taken all the benefits and even the God Devil Eyes belongs to you, right?</p><p>Jiang Buyi was so angry that he almost vomited blood, but there was nothing he could do.</p><p>Because what the Five Decays of Heaven and Man said made sense. If Ye Xiao didn’t die, he would be finished!</p><p>While Jiang Buyi dealt with this devilish energy within his body, he swore that once he removed this crappy countdown to exile in his mind…</p><p>The first one he would slaughter would be the Five Decays of Heaven and Man!</p><p>The second one was the Taboo Puppet that dared to deceive him!</p><p>Speaking of the Taboo Puppet…</p><p>Jiang Buyi and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had almost forgotten that the owner of the God Devil Eyes was actually a puppet who had no consciousness.</p><p>She was like a kite with two strings tied to it. After she ascended to the sky, the string split into two sides. One was in the hands of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, and the other was in the hands of Jiang Buyi.</p><p>The two of them had a tug of war and the puppet floated back and forth in the air. It became entangled between the two of them. It did not have the slightest bit of resistance and was at the mercy of others.</p><p>Coincidentally, Jiang Buyi and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man were extremely familiar with the abilities of the Three Loathsome Eyes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
