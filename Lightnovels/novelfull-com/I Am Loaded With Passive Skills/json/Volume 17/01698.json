(6)</p><p>At some point, there was a loud noise, and the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion suddenly expanded. Xu Xiaoshou also transformed into a golden Berserk Giant that was hundreds of feet tall.</p><p>Golden spots of light emitted from his body. Kong Yuhen frowned as he looked at it, wanting to reach out and touch this familiar fluctuation.</p><p>Bazhun’an stopped him. “At this time, restrain your curiosity. I will make a move.”</p><p>Kong Yuhen was stunned and recalled what the Bazhun’an had said earlier about guardian Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>It turned out to be no joke.</p><p>When anyone wanted to touch Xu Xiaoshou, who was in the midst of a breakthrough, he would attack. There was a high chance that he would be ruthless.</p><p>Kong Yuhen silently put down his hand and sighed, “His path energy is very strong.”</p><p>“For a genius, this is very normal.” Bazhun’an nodded.</p><p>“This is a path energy that can only be formed after a person in the Sovereign Dao Realm of comprehending the Great Path for many years. He has a chance of reaching the Upanishad Realm that you mentioned.”</p><p>“It’s not a hope, but a necessity. To a genius, this is the foundation.”</p><p>“Aren’t you giving him too much pressure?”</p><p>“This isn’t too much. For a genius, this is a little too small. He has yet to experience great pressure because I haven’t been able to use my full strength yet.”</p><p>Kong Yuhen was speechless.</p><p>“Perhaps in the future, if there is a chance, I can send him to Godhood and Kui Leihan to hone his skills. They should be able to help.”</p><p>Kong Yuhen remained silent.</p><p>After thinking for a long time, he looked up at this guy who was calm in his godhood state, but every move he made had something that outsiders should call ‘strong arrogance’.</p><p>“I want to challenge you.”</p><p>“Not now.”</p><p>“When can I?”</p><p>“When you really dare to fight and have challenged and won against others, then you’ll be qualified to challenge me.”</p><p>Kong Yuhen raised his eyebrows. “Do you think that right now, I can’t win against you 100%?”</p><p>Bazhun’an’s gaze remained on Xu Xiaoshou and he shook his head gently upon hearing the words. “Don’t think about it like that. It’s too simplistic. You should be thinking about how to die, not how to win.”</p><p>Within the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion, silence fell once again. Only the spiritual source aura surged higher and higher, like a tsunami, hitting over.</p><p>“Snap!”</p><p>The window of the wooden attic was suddenly pushed open.</p><p>The fluctuations in space shimmered and reflected the figures of Mu Zixi and Elder Han, who were still circling and waiting on the street outside the building. However, they could not sense anything.</p><p>“Whoosh.”</p><p>Time Ancestor Shadow Staff suddenly flew out. In fact, it had always been in Xu Xiaoshou’s hand. This time, it flew from Xu Xiaoshou’s hand to Kong Yuhen’s hand.</p><p>Kong Yuhen’s thoughts were suddenly brought back.</p><p>“This kid is really greedy.”</p><p>He was aware of the process of breaking through would provoke the fluctuations of the two laws of time and space that he was familiar with.</p><p>Bazhun’an watched all of this and laughed heartily.</p><p>He liked people with big appetites!</p><p>Restraint was a limitation on oneself. It was a posture that only people who were still in awe of something would show.</p><p>A true genius didn’t need to be restrained. He could do whatever he wanted.</p><p>To them, having lofty aspirations was a sign of ambition, while excessive restraint turned into cowardice.</p><p>To Bazhun’an, Xu Xiaoshou should be the way he is now!</p><p>Don’t bother me with things like Kong Yuhen and Man Yuhen.</p><p>If you want it, just take it. It’s that simple.</p><p>Once you have it, cultivate it. It’s not complicated.</p><p>As for whether you can cultivate the so-called ‘Upanishad’, that’s something to consider after you break through to the Sovereign Dao Realm. It has nothing to do with breaking through to the Sovereign Dao Realm now.</p><p>Geniuses were incomprehensible.</p><p>“Is ‘Spatial Upanishad’ stronger or is ‘Penetrating Divince Senses’ stronger?”</p><p>One was the realm, and the other was a brand-new way of using energy that was comparable to the power of the ancestral source. They are essentially incomparable.</p><p>However, some people could comprehend Spatial Upanishad and create Penetrating Divine Sense.</p><p>This kind of person could not be explained with reason.</p><p>Bazhun’an knew other people like this, including Cen Qiaofu and Xu Xiaoshou before him. He considered himself one of them.</p><p>Therefore, he understood that the rules were made for the sake of mortals to protect them.</p><p>However, the so-called genius was actually someone who jumped out and broke the rules first before setting them.</p><p>Under the guidance of this thought, Bazhun’an was pleased to see the different path energy spreading out Xu Xiaoshou’s body.</p><p>Even he could not understand it…</p><p>This meant that Xu Xiaoshou was not following the path of righteousness!</p><p>When this phenomenon lasted for an unknown period of time, it began to recede, and the path energy also returned to Xu Xiaoshou’s body.</p><p>He knew that a monster was about to be born.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The last layer of aura gathered.</p><p>The giant Xu Xiaoshou returned to his original size.</p><p>He stood with his left leg while his right leg remained crossed, his left palm was placed together, and his right palm held a sword. He wore only a few tattered clothes but had blue and white flames with wings on his back. His face was calm without any visible fluctuations, but his body was full of Devil’s Will. His black hair was broken and fluttered in the wind.</p><p>“A combination of contradictions.” Kong Yuhen commented. He did not dare to make a definite conclusion about this eerie new being.</p><p>“Only then can sparks fly.” Bazhun’an nodded, his eyes full of praise.</p><p>Suddenly, the eerie and contradictory combination opened its eyes. There was no trace of human emotion in its gaze, only emptiness of the Great Path.</p><p>The Devil’s Will was like a vortex, turning into endless darkness between the two pupils.</p><p>As soon as their eyes met, Bazhun’an felt himself being sucked in.</p><p>He didn’t resist at all, allowing his spirit to flow into that marvelous realm.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Under the Nine Heavens Lightning Calamity, volcanic eruptions, mountain torrents, tsunamis, and various other apocalyptic disasters, tall buildings rose out of thin air. A black figure stood on the top of the building.</p><p>Bazhun’an glanced up and down, his eyes filled with astonishment.</p><p>What did he see?</p><p>In his mind, Xu Xiaoshou compared himself to the Sword God Gu Louying.</p><p>Without even needing to turn around, Bazhun’an imagined the scene after this guy turned around. He had wanted to do this before!</p><p>“Kid, you are teachable.”</p><p>The shadow on the top of the building suddenly turned around. The sword light tore the celestial river apart, and devilish energy surged into his body.</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>Three flowers condensed into a hilt and formed a cyclone above Bazhun’an’s head, In shock, his spiritual body subconsciously wanted to counterattack.</p><p>However, he took a deep breath and exhaled, dispersing all the fluctuations. He allowed the devilish energy to invade his body and stain his entire body black, but his eyes remained cloudy and unchanged.</p><p>“Cultivation deviation. This little fellow can also control it…”</p><p>Bazhun’an walked out of Xu Xiaoshou’s spiritual world calmly. He blinked his eyes and saw Kong Yuhen’s eyes trembling with a faint demonic aura around him as he retreated.</p><p>“Are you alright?” Kong Yuhen asked in shock.</p><p>“What’s the matter?” Bazhun’an laughed.</p><p>The conversation abruptly ended.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes regained their humanity, and his vision returned to the present. He saw a face with a faint smile and another face with a drooping mouth.</p><p>“The Sovereign Dao Realm!”</p><p>His first reaction wasn’t to cheer or to report the good news. Instead, he widened his eyes and looked at the Information Bar.</p><p>As expected!</p><p>“[Passive System] is upgrading. Please do not disturb!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>“Congratulations, [Passive System] has been upgraded successfully!”</p><p>“Unlocked new module, Field of Profound Dao!”</p><p>“Obtained special passive skill, Unity of Man and the Heavens!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
