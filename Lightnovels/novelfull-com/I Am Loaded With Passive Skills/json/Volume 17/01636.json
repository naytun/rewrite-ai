(3)</p><p>However, after he was locked up on the Inner Island and sorted himself out, Elder Han already knew how much he was worth.</p><p>In the past, when he was on the Inner Island, he was just an abandoned pawn. He was not even qualified to be used by others. Now, his ability to escape had been noticed and he now had the chance to come out.</p><p>Compared to those cold and indifferent big shots on the Inner Island, Elder Han felt a long-lost sense of ‘being needed’ from Lord Chen Tan.</p><p>Moreover, this ‘need’ was not something minor, but extremely intense!</p><p>He had not even thought of the repayment of gratitude yet.</p><p>This was because Elder Han only believed 90% of Lord Chen Tan’s words. He had to wait until he personally witnessed the balance before he could be completely sure.</p><p>Elder Han also believed that with Lord Chen Tan’s intelligence, he could tell that his sincerity was not whole at the moment.</p><p>Both sides were now willing to trust each other, but they still had that slight doubt in their hearts.</p><p>At a time like this, Elder Han was not stupid enough to play any tricks.</p><p>This was a rare fleeting opportunity and all the more he had to seize it.</p><p>Even if he couldn’t confirm the final point, if Lord Chen Tan needed it, he, Elder Han, would immediately strike.</p><p>If in the end, Lord Chen Tan’s words proved to be false and he was only bragging, Elder Han would not lose anything and would just turn around and leave.</p><p>However, if it turned out that Lord Chen Tan’s words were 100% true, then in this uncertain period of time, Elder Han’s loyalty would be rewarded with an indescribably huge amount of wealth.</p><p>To be able to survive after so many years on the the Inner Island of the Abyss Island, Elder Han had his own set of rules for survival and how to deal with the big shots.</p><p>Don’t question, don’t think too much, don’t disobey!</p><p>If he did these three things well, he wouldn’t be a commander, but would be qualified to become a general who would charge forward.</p><p>The role that Elder Han had placed on himself was that he would be the most perfect of protectors and the blade with the utmost Sharpness in the path of Lord Chen Tan’s rise from his humble state!</p><p>“Let me take a look at that green stone of yours.” Xu Xiaoshou stretched his hand out.</p><p>Elder Han’s train of thought was suddenly cut off. His face darkened, but he didn’t say anything. He took out the supreme treasure bestowed by Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison and handed it over.</p><p>“What is this called?”</p><p>“Corner of Divine Prison.”</p><p>“Divine Prison? What’s a Divine Prison? ”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou snorted and scoffed at this explanation.</p><p>He held the Corner of Divine Prison and examined the green stone carefully. He wanted to see if it had any abilities similar to the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale.</p><p>In the end, after he pondered for a while, no Transformation took place.</p><p>As soon as he injected his spiritual source…</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The Corner of Divine Prison suddenly quivered violently.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have been pulled into another world.</p><p>He saw a boundless dark green prison, surrounded by cells with ancient fences inserted in various directions.</p><p>Endless howls and roars mixed with hysteria, insanity and pain could be heard faintly. He tried to listen to the sounds, but could not hear it clearly; he tried to see what was there, but could not make out the images clearly too.</p><p>At the end of the only passage, there was a person in a green prison uniform.</p><p>This person’s face could not be seen and he could not tell his age either. His entire body was blurry.</p><p>Only his limbs were shackled like the wretched saint he had seen in the past, with a few broken black chains.</p><p>“Nice to meet you, Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>“Let’s not talk about anything else. I’ll give you a few small gifts first. As for what they are, you can figure it out yourself.”</p><p>With a swish, the illusion disappeared along with all the scenes in the green prison, as if it had never been there.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not recall whether the voice was male or female. He could not remember the exact details.</p><p>Only the meaning behind it seemed to be deeply imprinted in his mind.</p><p>“Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison… He, she or it was Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison?”</p><p>“He gave me a gift. What sort of gift? Why did he not tell me directly…”</p><p>But all the illusions had disappeared.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held the green stone in his hand. No matter how much spiritual source he injected, the earlier phenomenon did not reappear.</p><p>“Brother Chen, what happened?”</p><p>Elder Han was stunned. He immediately looked around vigilantly.</p><p>In that instant just now, he had felt the power of Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison!</p><p>Perhaps he was here to punish him, but at this time, he could only stand firmly on Lord Chen Tan’s side. Only then would he have a better chance of survival.</p><p>“It’s nothing.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned and shook his head. He glanced at Elder Han, who was highly vigilant. He quickly calmed down. “Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison just greeted me. ”</p><p>“Ah?” Elder Han’s face had turned deathly pale. He was so frightened that he looked like a corpse.</p><p>Greeted you?</p><p>Lord Chen Tan… He was indeed unfathomable!</p><p>“I’ll return it to you.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou threw the Corner of Divine Prison back to Elder Han. He had already obtained the person, so there was no need to care about this trivial item.</p><p>In essence, they are all mine!</p><p>Elder Han was flattered. Lord Chen Tan didn’t even care about Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison’s treasure?</p><p>Oh, that’s right. Lord Chen Tan had the power inheritance of the Great Infernal Ancestor, the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon and the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch…</p><p>So Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison’s item was of no consequence to him?</p><p>No! A big shot must have his own ideas!</p><p>Perhaps, Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison’s greeting wasn’t sincere enough and Lord Chen Tan didn’t like him anymore? So he didn’t accept his gift?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
