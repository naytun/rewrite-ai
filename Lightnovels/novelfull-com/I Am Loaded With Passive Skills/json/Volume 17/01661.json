(4)</p><p>The most bizarre thing was that the attack methods were also maxed out, and all of them caused mental damage!</p><p>Ignore distance, ignore defense, ignore realm, and even ignore friend and foe when you’re crazy…</p><p>Perhaps the above ‘ignore’ had its restrictions.</p><p>However, this was only during the later period of Mu Zixi’s life.</p><p>If she was weak, then these restrictions were extremely great.</p><p>When she reached the Sovereign Dao Realm, she even grasped the Holy Power.</p><p>This was like a trapped beast that had escaped from its cage. As long as no one was on guard in advance, there was no way to stop it!</p><p>The second true body was also numbed.</p><p>He thought that little junior sister was here as a joke.</p><p>He had never expected that this girl could really attack the water-type Clone and damage Yu Lingdi’s main body from afar!</p><p>It was as if everyone had subconsciously forgotten…</p><p>When there were two higher void levels and one Demi-Saint, Mu Zixi could only run.</p><p>However, everyone present was severely injured, and even Yu Lingdi only had one water-type Clone.</p><p>Yu Lingdi and Xu Xiaoshou’s second true bodies were not the only ones in peak condition.</p><p>In terms of status…</p><p>Mu Zixi, the little girl who had almost drained the Life force of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was the best in the arena!</p><p>Her strength had been preserved from the beginning of the battle to the end, and she was still stronger!</p><p>“God’s Fall!”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s rampage was not over yet.</p><p>At first, she just made an attempt.</p><p>Gradually, after she realized that Yu Lingdi, this weak chicken, had no strength to resist, this girl’s full vent erupted.</p><p>“Who told you to attack Xu Xiashou! This attack is for Xu Xiashou… Devil’s Might!”</p><p>“How dare you hit my Master! In the end, it’s all because of you that my Master was captured… God’s Fall!”</p><p>“God’s Fall!”</p><p>“Devil’s Might!”</p><p>“God’s… Ah, I feel a little dizzy!”</p><p>The little girl suddenly staggered.</p><p>The anger in her bloodshot eyes faded away in an instant, after a single swipe from Yu Lingdi.</p><p>Even her small face turned pale.</p><p>The dozen or so consecutive shots of God’s Fall and Devil’s Might had almost depleted the Life force that Mu Zixi had extracted from the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>Even her own spiritual source was almost exhausted.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was completely stunned by what he saw through his second true body.</p><p>He did not understand…</p><p>Did Mu Zixi also have the High Spirits?</p><p>She should have been weakened long ago. How could she continue to incur such high-intensity damage?</p><p>“That’s not right. It’s indeed possible for junior sister to attack like this in succession. It’s just that she had never tried it before…”</p><p>“She still has a small world behind her. She’s the master of the White Cave!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never underestimated Mu Zixi.</p><p>Or rather, he had never underestimated the energy in his little junior sister’s body.</p><p>But today, he realized that he seemed to have underestimated Mu Zixi.</p><p>Lei family…</p><p>God Devil Eyes…</p><p>How should he put it?</p><p>Perhaps, from the perspective of a Senior Brother, he shouldn’t have this thought. However, the Lei family’s destruction seemed to have a certain truth to it!</p><p>“Yu Lingdi, did you turn into a fool after being blasted?”</p><p>When he thought of this, he looked away.</p><p>Mu Zixi’s attacks had stopped, and Yu Lingdi seemed to have obtained a chance to catch his breath. However, he did not dare to resist at all. His water-type Clone exploded into pieces instantly and ended his mission in painful howls.</p><p>The pitter-patter of the rain disappeared.</p><p>The water-type Power Upanishad Formation that covered the entire arena had also disappeared.</p><p>Due to Mu Zixi’s attack, Yu Lingdi was in so much pain that even his water-type Clone couldn’t find the time to cut off the connection? If he stopped now, would everything he had stop as well?</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>At this moment, a loud roar came from the distance and echoed throughout the First Hall of Sins!</p><p>Both Xu Xiaoshou, who was on his way, and his second true body heard it.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly turned around.</p><p>This voice sounded familiar to him. It belonged to the Void Attendant.</p><p>However, the strength of the energy and the Holy Power fluctuations contained within it…</p><p>Void General!</p><p>It came from the direction of Zhen Huang Palace?</p><p>“Bang… bang… bang…”</p><p>The sound of heavy footsteps suddenly came from outside the arena. It was the Void Attendant, who ran at an extreme speed!</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Before he could regain his senses, the sound of wind broke through the horizon.</p><p>A Void Attendant that was more than a thousand feet tall flew over from afar. It raised its fists, and its eyes were bloodshot. It seemed to have completely lost its mind, but it also seemed to be controlled by someone.</p><p>No matter what…</p><p>The Void Attendant’s fists were directed at Mu Zixi, who was in a daze after she blasted away at Yu Lingdi!</p><p>“Who dares to touch her?”</p><p>The eyes of the second true body turned red, and golden light spots appeared all over its body. With a boom, it turned into a Berserk Giant and whipped the Void Attendant who was of the same size, into the air.</p><p>In this attack, he had even compressed the Close-bounds Force Field and turned his entire leg into a sharp and famed sword.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>With one strike, the Void Attendant’s head was cut off and sent flying.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>How could it be so easy?</p><p>When did the Void Attendant become such an easy target to kill?</p><p>Moreover, why was it that I only kicked once, yet there were two sounds?</p><p>He lowered his head and with his Perception, sensed that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had appeared in front of little junior sister.</p><p>With his human body, he kicked the lower half of the Void Attendant’s body and sent it flying!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Void Attendant, whose head and legs had been severed, had only the middle half of its body left. It crashed onto the ground and raised a cloud of dust.</p><p>The scene fell silent.</p><p>Mu Zixi’s heart stopped beating.</p><p>She had just regained her senses when the Void Attendant was already in her face.</p><p>In the next second, the golden giant and the orange masked man stood in front of her together to protect her. They both kicked out at the same time, and split the dark and evil Void Attendant into three sections!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
