(1)</p><p>Azure Marsh.</p><p>One of the nine extreme grounds on Abyss Island.</p><p>If the First Hall of Sins was in the north, then this place was in the extreme south. The two of them were separated by half of the giant kingdom of Abyss Island. Thus they faced each other from afar.</p><p>The Azure Marsh was originally a muddy green marsh. Nothing could grow here. Any one who had spiritual quality and stepped into it would be swallowed up by these extreme grounds.</p><p>At this moment, the Azure Marsh that had been silent for countless years was in a total mess. There were traces of frost splashes, electric eels that swam about and there was sword energy everywhere.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>When the last Thunder Calamity struck down from the Nine Heavens, the dark clouds retreated.</p><p>In the void, a charred figure put down the sword in her hand easily. She stood on the Heavenly Divine Sword Xuan Cang. She panted heavily and sweat poured profusely from her body.</p><p>At a slight distance from her head, this Semi-Saint person emitted a mysterious seven-colored light that spun continuously. It seemed to have absorbed enough energy and emitted a ray of support light that shone on the woman below.</p><p>“Yeah!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao moaned and stretched out her hands as she enjoyed this moment to her heart’s content.</p><p>This was her moment!</p><p>At this time, no one in the world could take away her glory. She deserved it.</p><p>Under the nourishment of the Holy Light, Rao Yaoyao closed her eyes and raised her head. The charred dirt on her slender swan-like neck faded bit by bit.</p><p>Soon, all the wounds on her body were healed, and all the filth on her mortal body were removed. She transformed into a true Saint body that was radiant and full of energy.</p><p>“The sword is guided by the world of mortals. It forgets the emotions of the great and transcends beyond the world…”</p><p>“The Holy Saint, the ultimate three realms, changed the five elements, and ascended to the Heavens…”</p><p>In the void, the decadent Saint Language drifted down.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao tapped the tip of her foot, and the Heavenly Divine Sword Xuan Cang flew up and landed in her palm.</p><p>She finally opened her eyes, and they glittered brightly. She flew with her sword, and her tattered silk dress fluttered in the wind.</p><p>“Today, I ask the Heavens to decree the sword to become a Saint!”</p><p>With this voice, the world of mortals rose up from the vast expanse of the Azure Marsh. The chanting pushed Rao Yaoyao’s Sword Will to the peak of Sainthood.</p><p>The chanting sounds of the sword drifted and soared through the Nine Heavens.</p><p>Abyss Island, the nine extreme grounds, the giant kingdom, outside the wilderness… All those who had the spiritual quality heard the sounds of the sword and heard the Saint Language. They trembled and then worshipped the sword.</p><p>“Today, I ask the Heavens to decree the sword to become a Saint…”</p><p>“Today, I ask the Heavens to decree the sword to become a Saint…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou and Elder Han, who were on their way, suddenly heard these echoes. At the same time, their hairs stood on end. With a snap, they used all their strength to hide themselves.</p><p>Ye Xiao, Jiang Buyi, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, and Mu Zixi, who were still in the debilitated space of the First Hall of Sins, turned to look when they heard the voice. Their pupils constricted. Even if they didn’t know what it meant, they understood the enlightenment of the Saint Language.</p><p>Inside the great hall, Mei Siren silently looked at the dozens of Void Attendants before him. He sighed and continued to fight against these indestructible creatures.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong, who had just raised his eyes to see the words Zhen Huang Palace, stopped and looked back. A look of surprise flashed across his eyes. He tightened the sack on his shoulder and ducked into the great array.</p><p>Mu Lin, who was soaking in the magma in the realm of absolute ember, had just closed his eyes to rest. Only half of his face was exposed. Suddenly, he opened his eyes. The fire bubble beside him exploded, and Bai Lian, whom he had found, rushed out with a panicked expression.</p><p>“Supreme Master, someone became a Saint! Aren’t we enjoying ourselves a little too much?”</p><p>“However, we are only here to patrol the Yunlun Mountain Range…”</p><p>“Then, are we still going to soak?”</p><p>“Hua… Chang… Deng!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao could not help but mutter softly when she felt the power in her body as she sheathed the Cang Godhood Sword on her back.</p><p>She had finally reached this step!</p><p>Demi-Saint!</p><p>Many years ago, the Hua and Rao families produced two Way of the Sword geniuses at the same time. The family invited the renowned Swordsman at that time to enlighten the young people who liked the Way of the Sword.</p><p>The teacher’s surname was Mei.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao also met Hua Changdeng, at the same time.</p><p>He was a guy who had almost maxed out his talent points. In the three days of enlightenment, the speed at which he comprehended things was always a little faster than hers.</p><p>Just this trace…</p><p>The further he went, the more obvious the gap became!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao later found out that Hua Changdeng’s sword practice timing was just three days earlier than hers.</p><p>But for these three days, she took more than thirty years to catch up.</p><p>Today, she had finally reached this step. She had stepped into the realm that Hua Changdeng had entered more than 30 years ago.</p><p>“You will be defeated by my sword!”</p><p>Inch by inch, Rao Yaoyao caressed the sword body of the Cang Godhood Sword, her eyes full of Sword Will.</p><p>She had only chased after this one person in her life because he was the one who had defeated Bazhun’an.</p><p>But now, Hua Changdeng had disappeared.</p><p>After You Tu killed his way to the Saint Mountain, he had spent many years in the Land of Screen and Candles, accompanied by willows and had aged gradually.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao didn’t believe that Hua Changdeng had gone into a decline.</p><p>Creatures like the Ancient Swordsman needed time to settle down.</p><p>If the sword wielder did not want to improve and remained status quo for a hundred years… once he received enlightenment, he could accidentally break through the Saint level if he was not careful.</p><p>This was completely different from the enhancement path of the Spiritual Cultivator. It required enlightenment, and one had to pay more attention to the ‘Intent’ rather than the ‘Form’.</p><p>Hence, after Rao Yaoyao became a Saint, the first thing she decided to do was to return to the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe and challenge Hua Changdeng. At the very least, she would be able to remove this guy from the Land of Screen and Candles.</p><p>A dignified descendant of the Hua Clan, a dignified Sword Saint of the Ancient Swordsman, yet he was willing to wait there until he died. What kind of ability was that?</p><p>If you can’t move, I’ll use you.</p><p>The red-clothed people needed this level of combat strength. Rao Yaoyao thought… No, she had thought about it for a long time.</p><p>Hua Changdeng had to be used by her and give something back to the Holy Divine Palace!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
