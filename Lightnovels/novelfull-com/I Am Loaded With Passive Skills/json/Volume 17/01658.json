He could do this when he relied on the mutual positioning of his main body and second true body.</p><p>However, the labyrinth of the First Hall of Sins was too strange.</p><p>It seemed to be going against him!</p><p>Even with Elder Han’s Guidance, the direction of their journey seemed to be straightforward.</p><p>In the end, they would find that they had gone astray and had to change directions.</p><p>“Yu Lingdi is secretly causing problems?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had no choice but to think so. After all, he had the secondary plane door in his hands.</p><p>However, as time passed, he felt that the distance between himself and the second true body was very close!</p><p>As long as the Perception on both sides were connected, he could instantly enter the battlefield.</p><p>“Have you met the Water-type Upanishad, Elder Han?” Xu Xiaoshou asked as he ran. He was already making arrangements about what to do after he entered the venue.</p><p>“Upanishad?” The little ferret on his shoulder was surprised. “I’ve heard of it. There used to be a Great Demon King Yu Mo in the Holy Divine Palace…”</p><p>“This time, it’s his son, Yu Lingdi. He’s at the Cutting Path Stage with a Water-type Upanishad cultivation level.”</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“His ability is a little disgusting. If you were to fight him, would you be confident enough?”</p><p>“Ji… ji… ji…”</p><p>Elder Han was amused. After he let out a few sharp laughs, he said in a mocking tone, “Brother Chen, aren’t you underestimating me? What did you say his cultivation level was?”</p><p>“Do you think that the Water-type Upanishad at the Cutting Path Stage can fight with a Demi-Saint?”</p><p>“Like I said, his ability is a little disgusting. ”</p><p>“So you don’t think the Demi-Saint’s ability is equally disgusting? You don’t even think it’s comparable to a junior at the Cutting Page Stage?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was silent for a moment.</p><p>The pressure that Yu Lingdi exerted on him was indeed quite great, especially when he had obtained the secondary plane door.</p><p>But Elder Han’s words were not without reason.</p><p>The Water-type Upanishad was strong, but the Cutting Path Stage was only the Cutting Path Stage. It could not even be considered as a higher void.</p><p>Perhaps Yu Lingdi’s first attack after he witnessed a normal battle would be sufficient to snatch Ye Xiao back. It could severely injure the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and even harm his second true body.</p><p>However, it was almost impossible for him to fight against a Demi-Saint.</p><p>Well, let alone a Demi-Saint…</p><p>As long as the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had not been so severely injured, probably even Yu Lingdi would not dare to appear.</p><p>Since he had a backup plan, he could see Ye Xiao’s tragic state at the scene.</p><p>In that case, he would only dare to come out when he saw that Ye Xiao was about to die and confirmed the condition of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>This was not without good reason.</p><p>“Remember what you said.” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes flashed fiercely. “If you can catch up later, just keep an eye on Yu Lingdi and beat him up. Don’t worry about the rest!”</p><p>Elder Han could hear the anger in Brother Chen’s voice.</p><p>“Do you have a grudge against him?”</p><p>“Death feud!”</p><p>“Very good, then I know what to do.” Elder Han giggled. “Yu Lingdi…”</p><p>“Right!”</p><p>After he paused for a while, Elder Han asked, “What about that Five Decays of Heaven and Man? I think he’s the main factor. According to your description, he’s much harder to deal with than the Water-type Upanishad.”</p><p>On the way to the battlefield, Xu Xiaoshou had already described the chaos there to Elder Han.</p><p>“Leave him to me.” Xu Xiaoshou said after he pondered for a moment.</p><p>He always felt that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was a little special and did not seem to display much malice towards him.</p><p>Even if his second true body appeared in the form of Huang Quan and his cover was blown, he did not have much killing intent when he chose to attack.</p><p>It was as if he just wanted to destroy the second true body so that he had a better chance to snatch the God Devil Eyes.</p><p>“Does Yama really value me, Xu Xiaoshou, that much?”</p><p>When he recalled the past invitation from Yama, Xu Xiaoshou could not help but be suspicious.</p><p>But he really couldn’t understand this.</p><p>At least from his own point of view, he felt that he could not do it to Yama… No matter how talented the other party was, he still treated him with such kindness and sincerity. Moreover, he did not give up even after being rejected.</p><p>Yama had a genius!</p><p>The Nine Serenities Ghost Child that he defeated in Dongtianwang City seemed to have mastered the iron-type Upanishad.</p><p>But from another perspective…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized that he only wanted to kill him. He did not want to let him live nor did he want to invite him to join the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>“I don’t understand.”</p><p>Elder Han obviously didn’t understand what Brother Chen’s thoughts were.</p><p>He reminded him worriedly.</p><p>“If you’re on your own, no matter how heavily injured that Five Decays of Heaven and Man is, you won’t be able to defeat him.”</p><p>“Don’t forget, you told me before that he’s actually a… Hmm, Ghost Beast host body… What a disgusting name. Why can’t you humans call it a ‘Saint Beast?”</p><p>“But no matter what, I am more familiar with that power than you!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head. “I won’t fight him. I don’t even want to fight with Yu Lingdi. It’s best if you guys fight. I’ll just stand aside and watch.”</p><p>“Why?” Elder Han was curious. He didn’t feel like he was being used at all.</p><p>He had always felt that a person with brains like Brother Chen was most valuable as a commander outside the arena. He himself could not enter the arena easily, just like the Third Ancestor of the White Vein faction.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
