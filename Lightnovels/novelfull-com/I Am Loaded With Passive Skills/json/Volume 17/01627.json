(3)</p><p>Pure venting?</p><p>If you get rid of the grass but not the roots, you can only wait for retaliation, right? You can’t even compare to a strand of hair on Jiang Buyi’s head!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at Elder Han in disappointment. He had always wanted to wait for Elder Han to reveal more of his identity. In this way, he could make a certain judgment before he proceeded to the next step of the negotiation.</p><p>Who would have thought that this impulsive fellow had accomplished nothing other than making things up!</p><p>It was true that he would fabricate his identity. That meant that even if he was temporarily caught by the Holy Divine Palace, he would not disclose the true information, but…</p><p>Who am I?</p><p>What kind of idiot would that be, that a person with no status would dare to shout at a Demi-Saint in this manner?</p><p>Even if you think with your toes, you would know that I’m not simple. You can test me further!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not plan to wait any longer.</p><p>Based on what Elder Han had revealed earlier, he was 70% sure that Elder Han was Bazhun’an’s man.</p><p>Stop pretending!</p><p>I laid all my cards on the table!</p><p>If you’re really what I think you are, then you can wait for death!</p><p>“Impudent! A mere little Ghost Beast like you dares to attack me? ”</p><p>He did as he thought. Xu Xiaoshou shouted and his face became stern. He confronted this Demi-Saint with a Master Stage cultivation level. He even reprimanded him in the manner of a high-ranking person.</p><p>His words and actions were so natural.</p><p>It was to the extent that when Elder Han tried to attack, he felt that something was wrong, so he didn’t dare to kill him.</p><p>Elder Han stopped.</p><p>In the next second, he flew into a rage due to humiliation.</p><p>“You smart-assed kid, do you really think you’re the reincarnation of the Sword Demon. I’ll kill you today!”</p><p>Elder Han’s ice wings swept out and he no longer held back. He really wanted to teach Chen Tan a vicious lesson so he could vent the shame he experienced at the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes.</p><p>He raised two fingers and slowly reached into his sleeve. From the Yuan Mansion, he took out the Four Pillars of Destiny Token and threw it onto the ground.</p><p>“This is the Four Pillars of Destiny Token. To see this order is equivalent to seeing a person!”</p><p>“Kneel down!”</p><p>With a clang, the command token shot into the ground and landed close to the edge of Elder Han’s feet. The force was so great that it left a long and narrow crack in the ground.</p><p>The aura of Sword Cognition spread out.</p><p>The great hall suddenly fell silent.</p><p>“Squeak!”</p><p>It was as if Elder Han had suddenly stepped on the brakes. No matter how his upper body tried to lean forward, his feet suddenly stopped on their own accord. He did not dare to cross the long horizontal crack left by The Four Pillars of Destiny Token at all.</p><p>He finally withdrew his force, but his face was flushed red.</p><p>In the end, he couldn’t hold it in any longer and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Shock, fear, bewilderment, uneasiness, palpitations…</p><p>All sorts of emotions surged in his heart.</p><p>In the midst of that aura, the expression on Elder Han’s face changed at least a dozen times.</p><p>In the end, his eyes widened, and his face turned pale and purple. His cheeks twitched and convulsed.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>The ice wings on Elder Han’s back shattered with a bang. He panted heavily and shook his head repeatedly in disbelief.</p><p>He glanced at Chen Tan and then lowered his eyes to look at The Four Pillars of Destiny Token again.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>After he examined The Four Pillars of Destiny Token carefully, Elder Han felt as if all the blood in his body had been drained. His body even turned extremely cold.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“This isn’t right!”</p><p>“It shouldn’t have come to this…”</p><p>Elder Han couldn’t believe it. He raised his head again and stared at Chen Tan, as if he wanted to find some familiar traces on this young man.</p><p>“You, you, you…”</p><p>The more he looked, the more terrified he became!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression was indifferent, and there was no emotion in his eyes as he spoke calmly.</p><p>“Kneel down.”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>“I said, kneel down.”</p><p>“No…”</p><p>“Do you want me to say it a fourth time? Or do you have to stand in order to calm down?” Xu Xiaoshou held his hands behind his back, threw his chest out, and raised his chin slightly. He felt that at this moment, he was like… Uh, the Holy Emperor.</p><p>From the moment Elder Han came to a complete stop, he knew.</p><p>This person, he could control him easily!</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Elder Han’s knees trembled. His legs, which had just been healed, finally could not hold on any longer, and he fell to his knees.</p><p>He did not feel humiliated at all. It was as if this was the only way to confirm if The Four Pillars of Destiny Token was real or fake.</p><p>Thus, the moment he knelt, he immediately bent down and stretched out half a hand. He wanted to touch The Four Pillars of Destiny Token.</p><p>“Do you dare to move?”</p><p>Elder Han turned into an ice sculpture on the spot. One hand stopped at the side of The Four Pillars of Destiny Token. He did not dare to touch it again.</p><p>His head was bent extremely low, as if he did not dare to go higher than The Four Pillars of Destiny Token.</p><p>At such a close distance, he finally saw the details of The Four Pillars of Destiny token clearly.</p><p>What appeared in front of him was not the side with the words, but the other side with the patterns.</p><p>It was the form of a graceful naked woman. She hugged her knees and lowered her head and looked extremely pitiful. There were heavy shackles on her limbs, and the chains extended to the edge of the command token. It was as if they were connected to the Great Path of Heaven and Earth and would sink into eternal oblivion.</p><p>“This is impossible! F*ck him!”</p><p>“Where did this kid come from? This is impossible! ”</p><p>“Ahhh…”</p><p>Elder Han went berserk and he screamed hysterically in his heart.</p><p>However, at this moment, he understood that the command token was not a fake. It contained the aura of a demon… The command token was definitely real!</p><p>Elder Han knelt down and raised his head shakily.</p><p>This time, what he saw was no longer just Chen Tan’s ordinary face.</p><p>Behind this guy, there were many apparitions.</p><p>They were the Saints from the Inner Island of the Abyss Island.</p><p>Above the Saint, there was a young man who stood on a Demonic Emperor Black Dragon. He pointed his sword at the third Ancestor of the White Vein and was extremely arrogant and impudent.</p><p>However, no one dared to make a sound in his presence.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
