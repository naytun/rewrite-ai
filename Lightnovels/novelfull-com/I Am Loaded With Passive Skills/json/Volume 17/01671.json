How did you always manage to find such cute little pets? Is this for me? I like it very much…”</p><p>“This Elder! I am not a pet!”</p><p>Elder Han flew into a rage and interrupted Mu Zixi’s words. His fluffy tail stood up, and his round eyes glared. Instantly… He became even cuter now!</p><p>“Oh! Oh!” Mu Zixi’s eyes lit up like stars. “You even know how what an Elder is? You have more personality than Greedy the Cat Spirit. Xu Xiaoshou, I like it very much!”</p><p>As the little girl spoke, she carried the little ferret over and rubbed its head vigorously.</p><p>Elder Han only felt a tingling sensation spread throughout his entire body. He subconsciously opened his mouth and was about to moan, but he quickly suppressed this inexplicable joy. His fur stood up and he was about to attack.</p><p>“I said it before. This Elder is not…”</p><p>He had only mobilized half of his Holy Power when Elder Han’s voice stopped abruptly. He felt that something was wrong.</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>What did this little girl call out just now?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Who was she talking to?</p><p>There was no third person here, right?</p><p>Brother Chen…</p><p>Uh, Brother Chen, is Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Elder Han trembled as he looked back. Brother Chen stared calmly at him with a cold expression in his eyes.</p><p>But it wasn’t because he sensed something. His gaze seemed to be fixed on the Holy Power on his claws!</p><p>Elder Han retracted his Holy Power and he had a complicated look on his face. “You…”</p><p>“I have many identities, you can understand them as you wish, but whatever I said before is what it is. You don’t have to care about the various titles that anyone calls me by, or even if someone addressed me as Bazhun’an.” Xu Xiaoshou transformed into Bazhun’an. He put two of his fingers together and his sword cognition appeared.</p><p>No way!</p><p>This was not right!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was Brother Chen?</p><p>When the occasion called for it, he could also be Bazhun’an?</p><p>This…</p><p>Elder Han’s thoughts short-circuited.</p><p>“So the person I worshipped all this while was actually Bazhun’an’s successor, who has such a reputation in the Inner Island? But why did he not want to reveal his true identity?”</p><p>“Oh! Yes…”</p><p>“If I’m caught, I can only report the identities of ‘Chen Tan’, ‘Chen Shu’, ‘Chen Ruye’ and not ‘Xu Xiaoshou’. Is that what he meant?”</p><p>Elder Han seemed to have some sort of enlightenment. He raised his head and looked at the little girl.</p><p>Therefore, this young lady was Xu… Eh, the junior sister that Brother Chen rushed over to save?</p><p>Elder Han understood a little of Xu Xiaoshou’s identity.</p><p>He quickly calmed down, but he felt that something was wrong… No, something was really wrong!</p><p>What about the battlefield?</p><p>Where were the enemies?</p><p>Where was Yu Lingdi?</p><p>No matter who you are, I’m here to help you beat someone up, not to be stroked. I’m not here to be pampered like a pet…</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>“Chirp, chirp!”</p><p>An electric current streaked across his neck and interrupted Elder Han’s train of thought. The little round face showed a catlike satisfaction and he called out a few times.</p><p>He couldn’t understand.</p><p>But in the end, he still laid down in satisfaction.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>This was the crafty Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>The Xu Xiaoshou who was favored by the Third Ancestor of the Inner Island’s White Vein and the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon!</p><p>No wonder he had so many treasures that the big Boss of various factions had bet on. He should have thought of it long ago… This time, he seemed to have followed the right person?</p><p>“Chirp!”</p><p>Mu Zixi was still playing with the ferret.</p><p>However, Elder Han didn’t dare to make a move, much less retaliate.</p><p>What a humiliation!</p><p>I’m a Demi-Saint Stage Ghost Beast. You have to know… I should not be humiliated in this way!</p><p>But this time…</p><p>Forget it, this humiliation was somewhat cool.</p><p>If this is a dream, please let it continue. I don’t want to wake up.</p><p>If he followed Xu Xiaoshou, it was definitely not the wrong person to follow. This was Bazhun’an’s favorite person!</p><p>“Ji ji ji!”</p><p>“Stop scratching!”</p><p>“Sob… Eh? Cough cough! I said, stop scratching!”</p><p>“Ji ji ji!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The space exploded, and Xu Xiaoshou withdrew his fist.</p><p>The long-lost light pierced his eyes and made him very uncomfortable.</p><p>After they left the dark and gloomy First Hall of Sins and embraced the sunlight of the Abyss Island again, he seemed to have an illusion.</p><p>“We’re finally out of the sea of bitterness and escaped from the center of the storm!”</p><p>However, he could foresee that all this freedom would be short-lived.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, where are we going next?” Mu Zixi hugged Elder Han in her arms and was a little excited.</p><p>Elder Han was still not used to the smooth way the little girl addressed him as Xu Xiaoshou. His mind was still blank.</p><p>Mu Zixi was not as restricted as when she was in the First Hall of Sins, that was filled with darkness. She just felt that this trip was alright.</p><p>It was full of surprises, but there was no danger.</p><p>Although she had been separated from Xu Xiaoshou, she was still able to find him in the end. That was great!</p><p>“Are you a Demi-Saint? Or a Ghost Beast? Then Greedy the Cat Spirit should be considered your sister… Yes, you do look alike. I’ll introduce you to each other later.” Mu Zixi smiled as she stroked the fur on the little ferret’s head.</p><p>Little sister…</p><p>When did I have a long-lost sister?</p><p>Elder Han stared blankly at the sky. He didn’t dare to move and couldn’t respond at all.</p><p>“We won’t be going back.”</p><p>When he stepped into the land of the giant kingdom, Xu Xiaoshou was silent for a moment. He ignored the fact that his little junior sister was creating havoc for Elder Han.</p><p>He truly did not want to return to the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>The original intention to come to this place was to exchange for the Death Exemption Token.</p><p>Now that the goal had been achieved, although the First Hall of Sins was still in chaos… What did it have to do with me?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
