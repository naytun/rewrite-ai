(7)</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of something and gulped.</p><p>“If you have something to say, just say it!” Bazhun’an frowned.</p><p>“It’s this!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little hesitant and did not dare to ask.</p><p>When he thought about what Bazhun’an said just now, he forgot what danger meant.</p><p>He gritted his teeth and decided to go all out.</p><p>“You’ve made great strides all the way, but why did you ‘fall’ for decades in the middle? Were you just reckless and wasn’t it dangerous? Weren’t you very arrogant?”</p><p>Bazhun’an’s face suddenly darkened.</p><p>“(Glared at, Passive Points, +1)+1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said this with his eyes closed.</p><p>After he waited for a long time for the sword to slash through his neck, he finally decided not to use his second true body. He opened his eyes.</p><p>Bazhun’an didn’t make any move. He sighed heavily and said.</p><p>“That’s why I told you when I first met you.”</p><p>“The path of the Ancient Swordsman had long been ruined by others…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou recalled the scene when he met Bazhun’an by the Goose Lake after he killed Feng Kong and Shao Yi in the Outer Yard of the Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>He sighed.</p><p>So, it had been so long since these things happened.</p><p>“Why?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“This was, after all, the era of Spiritual Cultivation…”</p><p>Bazhun’an had given an ambiguous reply and in the end, he shook his head and didn’t say anything.</p><p>“Your current path is not bad. Continue to walk this path. Do not give up until you are exhausted.”</p><p>“Spiritual Cultivation, the Way of the Sword, forged body… and so on.”</p><p>“Perhaps, that is the right way.”</p><p>“But for now, I can’t give you an answer.”</p><p>“The Sovereign Dao Realm. This is the so-called ‘Struggle for the Great Path’ that you are about to begin is what it is about.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly understood why Bazhun’an told him the story of the Ten High Nobles before he even asked any questions.</p><p>Kui Leihan had the best Spiritual Cultivation; Shenyi was the best in body techniques and Bazhun’an was the best in the Way of the Sword…</p><p>Then what he wanted to cultivate himself was actually a combination of these three paths and he would not give any of them up!</p><p>If that was the case, then he really couldn’t compare himself to people like Rao Yaoyao and Jiang Buyi.</p><p>Only when Kui Leihan, Shenyi and Bazhun’an were brought together could he start his comparison.</p><p>And what Bazhun’an wanted was obviously more than that.</p><p>His huge appetite and wild temper were apparent from his words.</p><p>Bazhun’an had never allowed him to compete against those three.</p><p>Instead…</p><p>Beyond that!</p><p>In the Spiritual Library Division at the Tiansang Spirit Palace, Xu Xiaoshou had once mentioned to Elder Sang, “My interest does not lie in the Tiansang Spirit Palace, but in the Five Regions.”</p><p>That was the first time he learned about Bazhun’an. Elder Sang used this as a negative teaching example to reprimand him for being too ambitious!</p><p>Elder Sang was undoubtedly a genius.</p><p>However, even he had to first catch up with Bazhun’an before he talked about the other requirements.</p><p>But Bazhun’an…</p><p>This was a pure lunatic!</p><p>This person, from the moment he came into contact with him, had already given him this goal.</p><p>What he wanted was for him to surpass Kui Leihan, Shenyi, and himself! This was really an unsurmountable task!</p><p>“Hu…” Xu Xiaoshou let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p>“Under pressure?” Bazhun’an raised his eyebrows.</p><p>How could there be none, you lunatic? Do you think I’m you, a God… Xu Xiaoshou chuckled and said calmly, “No, there is none.”</p><p>“If there is none, then break through. Don’t waste time, I’ll be your guardian.” Bazhun’an raised his cup and dropped it on the table. “Do it here.”</p><p>Kong Yuhen nodded. He was happy to be the witness.</p><p>When he first met Xu Xiaoshou, he had not lied. He was really just here to befriend him.</p><p>“I have to make some preparations…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated, but he was too embarrassed not to follow Bazhun’an’s example as he raised up his cup.</p><p>Speaking of which, from the moment he entered the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion until now, Bazhun’an had only poured this cup of wine for him at the beginning. He had not even touched it yet. All he had done was to listen to his stories and being lectured at.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clinked his cup and threw back his head to pour the wine down his throat.</p><p>Bazhun’an drank it all in one gulp and shouted, “Good!”</p><p>Kong Yuhen raised his cup and remained silent for two breaths of time. Then, he raised his head and downed the cup before he set it down with a gloomy expression.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou swallowed the wine and felt his throat burn. He clicked his tongue a few times. “Oh right, what do I need to do to prepare for my Sovereign Dao Realm…”</p><p>His words stopped abruptly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly realized that the tiny cup of wine had turned into endless spiritual energy after it entered his stomach. It rushed into his sea of energy reserve and tore apart the paper thin bottleneck that covered his Star Worship State at the Master Stage!</p><p>“You!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes widened as he glared at Bazhun’an.</p><p>D*mn it, I was not ready yet!!!</p><p>Bazhun’an laughed and slapped the table with great delight.</p><p>He suddenly stood up and struck Xu Xiaoshou Xu hard. This caused the violent spiritual source in his body to go out of control. He reprimanded him.</p><p>“If you can make full preparations for this matter in advance, then it should not be a problem in the first place!”</p><p>“Moreover, you are now on a brand new path. If I don’t understand it, who in the world can?”</p><p>“Just focus on your breakthrough. I’m looking forward to see what kind of monster you can become!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
