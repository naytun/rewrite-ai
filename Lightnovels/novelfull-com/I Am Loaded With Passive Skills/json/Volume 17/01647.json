Since Yi had taken the initiative to look for her, his first thought should not be to retreat.</p><p>Ye Xiao understood Yi too well!</p><p>She was instantly convinced that after the Saint Servant discovered that Yi was alone, he used the orphan of the Lei family as a trap. Xu Xiaoshou then brought him to the elites of the Saint Servant. Then Yi, who was trapped could no longer escape and was killed!</p><p>“That is the truth!”</p><p>If Ye Xiao had been in a rational state, perhaps she would have taken advantage of the great opportunity when the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was temporarily in a fix. Since Jiang Buyi was unable to make a move too, she could have chosen to make her escape immediately.</p><p>She had to divulge the secret information that the Saint Servant had kept under wraps to the Holy Divine Palace first.</p><p>This way, even if she died in battle, someone would follow up and take revenge.</p><p>But at this moment, Ye Xiao looked at Mu Zixi and felt that the world had slowed down. Yi shook his head and waved at her.</p><p>“Don’t come over…”</p><p>How could she not go over?</p><p>“Aww!”</p><p>After an owl’s cry resounded, cracks appeared in the dark sky, and the God of Death’s owl eye opened up in the sky.</p><p>Ye Xiao made a crazy and bold decision!</p><p>She abandoned her main body that had suffered the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s Tribulation. Her soul body turned into a beam of light and flew across the sky. Under the gaze of the God of Death’s owl eye, she pounced on Mu Zixi.</p><p>Once the main body was careless, she would lose the game.</p><p>If she stayed any longer, she would only suffer misfortune and die an unnatural death.</p><p>Since it was difficult to wait for reinforcements to arrive, it was a wise decision to give up her main body and then seize another body.</p><p>No one present had thought that the biggest turn of events would actually come from Ye Xiao, who had lost her ability to fight!</p><p>Jiang Buyi finally stopped the invasion of the devilish energy. He looked up and saw that the Dark Division Chief had plans to take possession of his Taboo Puppet?</p><p>What kind of f*cking development was this!</p><p>Jiang Buyi shouted and was about to attack.</p><p>However, he was clear-headed at this time. He instantly remembered that he only had less than three days left in exile and took his time to get up.</p><p>At the same time, the God of Death’s owl eye in the sky seemed to be directed at him. Then Ye Xiao’s hysterical voice filled with killing intent rang out.</p><p>“If you stop me, you will kill me. This is tantamount to opposing the Holy Divine Palace. The dark group will emerge in full force. First, they will slaughter the Puxuan Jiang Clan of the Northern Region. Then, they will take you, Jiang Buyi. Don’t forget that I have the right to act first and report later!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi was stunned for a moment.</p><p>What was wrong with this crazy woman? Why did she suddenly have such a strong killing intent?</p><p>Was she crazy?</p><p>But Ye Xiao was right.</p><p>He, Jiang Buyi, could choose to be neutral when it came to the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. If he did not make a move, he could give an explanation later.</p><p>However, Ye Xiao’s Possession of the Taboo Puppet was a survival move.</p><p>Wasn’t cutting off a person’s path the same as killing them?</p><p>What was the difference between this and collaborating with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man to kill Ye Xiao?</p><p>Jiang Buyi hesitated.</p><p>The main thing was that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man also had his eye on the Taboo Puppet. He could not take it at the moment.</p><p>Since that was the case, he might as well be the neutral party and see how the situation with Ye Xiao, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and the Taboo Puppet would develop.</p><p>Jiang Buyi calmed down and sat down cross-legged to continue his recuperation.</p><p>“You’re right. Then I won’t make a move.”</p><p>“Jiang Buyi, why aren’t you attacking?!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi could remain calm, but the Five Decays of Heaven and Man could not. He roared furiously.</p><p>His Life force was almost drained, but Ye Xiao’s target was not him, but Mu Zixi.</p><p>The first generation of the Dark Division Chief had mastered the power of the God of Death. If she really succeeded in taking possession of Mu Zixi, she would have the Ultimate Life Demon Physique that could rival the Body of Decay. In addition, she would also have a pair of God Devil Eyes.</p><p>Even the Five Decays of Heaven and Man didn’t want to provoke such a person!</p><p>“Whoosh.”</p><p>With a soft sound, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man didn’t dare to hide anymore and threw out a spatial ring.</p><p>Jiang Buyi raised his eyes and glanced at it, but did not dare to take it.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man directly triggered an explosion and 50 Void Crystals flew out.</p><p>“I’ll give you 50 to stop Ye Xiao!”</p><p>Am I just a beggar in your eyes?</p><p>Jiang Buyi sneered as he watched the 50 Void Crystals fly over. He didn’t even have the slightest desire to take them.</p><p>But soon, his eyes swiveled and enlightenment appeared in his eyes.</p><p>“Swoosh!”</p><p>He swept away the flowing clouds and the 50 Void Crystals went into his bag. Jiang Buyi stood up and ran, His back faced the arena and he soon disappeared into the horizon.</p><p>“You guys carry on with your fight. I’ll be right back.”</p><p>When the Five Decays of Heaven and Man saw this, he was initially stunned. Finally, as if he had thought of something, he then roared at the top of his lungs, “Old dog Jiang, you will die a horrible death!”</p><p>The God of Death’s owl eye in the sky lost its target. It then turned to stare at the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and exerted all of its pressure.</p><p>The situation had developed to this point, and Ye Xiao, who had transformed into a soul body, could not help but sneer.</p><p>Jiang Buyi had fled and chose not to help either side. This was originally a bad thing.</p><p>However, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was unexpectedly being controlled by that little girl!</p><p>After a series of bad luck, her main body had been destroyed.</p><p>However, if her Possession succeeded, she would be able to obtain the Ultimate Life Demon Physique and the God Devil Eyes. She could even get rid of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>What was this called?</p><p>Change in Feng Shui… Nothing more!</p><p>“Now, it’s your turn to face a disaster.”</p><p>Ye Xiao turned into a beam of soul light in the night sky and plunged into Mu Zixi who was immersed in the process of the absorption of the Life force. Her cheeks were red and her eyes were blurred. She had completely forgotten that the first thing she had to do after she controlled someone was to leave the weak spot in space.</p><p>No one would have thought that such a little girl would be involved in the battle between the Demi-Saint and the Higher Void.</p><p>“Possession!”</p><p>Ye Xiao crashed into Mu Zixi’s soul body. At this moment, victory was within her grasp.</p><p>“Ha…”</p><p>After Jiang Buyi fled, the worry in the eyes of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man disappeared. His Life force was almost depleted, but he could still smile.</p><p>Finally, everything was set in stone.</p><p>Ye Xiao’s soul body crashed into Mu Zixi’s spiritual world. She was stunned when she saw two spiritual bodies, one big and one small, looking at her.</p><p>Mu Zixi’s absorption of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s Life force was also slightly interrupted by the Possession process.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man regained his mobility at this moment.</p><p>He raised his head with difficulty. The three gray flowers in his wrinkled right eye flipped. He looked at the three-legged black owl that had been abandoned by Ye Xiao.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>At this moment, the three-legged black owl that had its head lowered suddenly raised its head. Three gray flowers appeared in its eyes at the same time.</p><p>It opened its mouth, but it was no longer an owl’s cry, but a hoarse, old, and teasing voice.</p><p>“The fellow who was in the way has finally left…”</p><p>“My soul has returned!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
