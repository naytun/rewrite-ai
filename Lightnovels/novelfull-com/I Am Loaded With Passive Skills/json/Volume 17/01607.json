(2)</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>Gu Qinger’s famed sword broke in half, and his body was split into two.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>He couldn’t understand it, but he was greatly shocked.</p><p>“Why, why did you have to do that?”</p><p>At this moment, a notification popped up on the Information Bar.</p><p>“+(Hallucinating, Passive Points+) +.”</p><p>He turned around and saw Gu Qinger standing behind him, hugging his thigh with a terrified expression.</p><p>“Brother Chen, save me!”</p><p>“Saving a life is better than building a seven-storied pagoda.”</p><p>This fellow…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his scalp go numb.</p><p>The Fantasy Sword Technique just now was so smooth that even he could not see through it right away.</p><p>This Gu Qinger was really something!</p><p>However, how many beatings did this clown have to endure before he could be so skilled and predict all of his Senior Brother’s moves and take the necessary precautions in advance?</p><p>The panic-stricken Gu Qinger hugged the thigh of his savior, Brother Chen, and then felt that something was wrong.</p><p>His hands hurt and he quickly let go.</p><p>When he opened them to take a look, he realized that both his palms had been cut and now they bled. The web between his thumb and forefinger had split open!</p><p>Gu Qinger couldn’t help but fall into deep thought.</p><p>Impossible, I’ve experienced Eldest Senior Brother’s ‘Virtue Subduing Three Combo Strikes’ no less than a thousand times. How did he level up this time?</p><p>Through the Fantasy Sword Technique, the sword light could split the web between my thumb and forefinger?</p><p>There’s such a huge gap between me and Eldest Senior Brother?</p><p>Gu Qingyi turned around angrily with his sword in hand. Only when he saw Chen Shu standing between him and his junior brother did his anger subside.</p><p>“Brother Chen, move aside. If I don’t cut off one of his legs today, he won’t remember this lesson!”</p><p>“Alright.” Xu Xiaoshou moved to the side when he heard that.</p><p>Gu Qingyi and Gu Qinger were stunned by his action. Their eyes were filled with grief and helplessness.</p><p>That’s not right. Brother Chen, that move is not quite right?</p><p>Shouldn’t you be the peacemaker at this time and try to pacify my Senior Brother so he would have a way out?</p><p>And if he did not have a way out, I might really be dismembered!</p><p>“+(Received resentment. Passive Points)+1.”</p><p>Gu Qingyi did not carry out his threat.</p><p>He held his Famed Sword and wanted to slash it, but he couldn’t. He looked at his junior brother who was on the ground, with a blank expression, then at Chen Shu, then at his junior brother, and then back at Chen Shu.</p><p>“+(Cursed. Passive Points +)+1. ”</p><p>“Eldest Senior Brother, I was wrong. I will punish myself! You don’t have to do it, I’ll do it myself!”</p><p>Gu Qinger hurriedly issued a sincere apology. He held his sword and was so chastened that he almost knelt down and kowtowed.</p><p>“I’m willing to copy the Sword Sutra five times as punishment… Uh, ten… uh, fifty… Alright, alright, alright, a hundred times! I’m willing to copy the Sword Sutra a hundred times as punishment. After we return to the sect, I’ll go face the wall and reflect on my mistakes!”</p><p>Gu Qingyi took a deep breath and finally lowered his sword.</p><p>“Five thousand times!”</p><p>“Also, you are not allowed to speak in the First Hall of Sins. If you dare to say another word, I will chop you into pieces!”</p><p>“Alright, alright…” Gu Qinger hurriedly nodded. As he spoke, he saw Eldest Senior Brother raise his sword again. He realized something and hurriedly reached out to cover his mouth. “I won’t talk, I won’t talk…” Uh, I’ll shut up, shut up.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused.</p><p>This clown just couldn’t stop talking, right?</p><p>For him to be able to live until now, the name ‘Wen Ting’ must have saved his life more than once.</p><p>Of course, this kind of guy who always courted death had not died until now. He was either extremely lucky, or his strength was outrageous, just like his mouth.</p><p>After Gu Qinger got up resentfully, he quickly slipped behind his Eldest Senior Brother and massaged his shoulders and kneaded his head. However, after being glared at, he hurriedly stopped and did not dare to touch his head again.</p><p>“Hehe…” He laughed foolishly, but he was very pleased with himself.</p><p>How was copying the Sword Sutra a punishment? It was clearly a reward!</p><p>After he copied it five thousand times, he would definitely have another comprehension.</p><p>At that time, he would be able to leave his junior brothers behind, trample his Eldest Senior Brother underfoot. He could even point his sword at Wen Ting to seize the title of the Seven Sword Deity. It was not a mere dream.</p><p>“Brother Chen, let’s go. We can’t delay any longer.”</p><p>Gu Qing remembered that his Second Junior Brother’s savior only had four days left to live. Zhen Huang Palace was the top priority now.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded without saying anything. He followed confidently behind with a smile.</p><p>The environment in the First Hall of Sins was still gloomy.</p><p>The oppressive feeling brought by the Abyss Island in the Giant kingdom was still there.</p><p>However, when he followed these two Gu brothers, it was the first time that Xu Xiaoshou felt relaxed since he entered the Abyss Island.</p><p>Even if this kind of relaxation was only at this moment.</p><p>On the way to Zhen Huang Palace, there were no accidents at all. It was so quiet that it made people panic.</p><p>Other than the occasional roars of beasts, the faint sounds of battle from afar, and the muffled chatter that was blocked from his ears.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled and enjoyed the brief moment of peace. Suddenly, he envied Gu Qinger’s carefree life.</p><p>He was happy all the time.</p><p>Along the way, he picked up a few more tree seeds every now and then. The information inside was the same. They were all ‘Zheng Huang Palace’, Jiang Buyi’.</p><p>The smile on Xu Xiaoshou’s face finally disappeared.</p><p>Tranquility…</p><p>How long could this luxurious tranquility last?</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>After he forced the Void Attendant to retreat with a single glance, Jiang Buyi did not make a move. He led the Taboo Puppet who was behind him and guarded the obviously weak space in the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>The golden water droplet in his hand emitted a light, and the black crow that was projected inside still tried to escape.</p><p>The places they passed along the way were clearly not the same places that Jiang Buyi guarded at this moment. It was not even the paths that Jiang Buyi had taken.</p><p>However, Jiang Buyi was very calm and was not anxious at all.</p><p>The biggest difference between Demi-Saints and those below the level of Demi-Saints was that one cultivated the Holy Path and the other cultivated the Way of the Heavens.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
