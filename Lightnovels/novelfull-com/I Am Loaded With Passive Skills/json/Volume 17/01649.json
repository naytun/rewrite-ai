There were scenes of Mei Siren teaching Xu Xiaoshou the sword on the long street at the giant kingdom…</p><p>Although the images were incomplete, he could roughly visualize the entire process.</p><p>In the end, the space flashed and everything disappeared and only the masked man in the gold robe was left. He stopped in midair and his eyes flashed like lightning.</p><p>Mei Siren stood up, shook his head and sighed. “The power of time and space is really amazing…”</p><p>He understood that Huang Quan knew everything, so he must have had a motive when he came to look for him. It was impossible that he would just give him a command token and save him from this strange Abandoned Dimension Hall.</p><p>“What’s the condition?” Mei Siren picked up the Death Exemption Token, stepped forward and asked again.</p><p>“Help me kill someone. He is also your enemy.”</p><p>“Kill who?”</p><p>“Jiang Buyi!”</p><p>“Who the f*ck is calling me again?”</p><p>“So annoying!”</p><p>In the darkness of the labyrinth in the First Hall of Sins, a cloud that charged forward at full speed suddenly stopped.</p><p>Jiang Buyi almost subconsciously wanted to take a look and see which little rascal dared to call out his name. However, very quickly, he suppressed the urge to court death.</p><p>“D*mn it, d*mn it, d*mn it!”</p><p>During the chaotic battle between the four of them just now, he had actually sensed that someone had called his name.</p><p>In the end, he turned around…</p><p>It was a critical hit from afar!</p><p>It was Rao Yaoyao, who had succeeded and became a Saint!</p><p>One of the members of the ten-member council of the Holy Divine Palace, Divine Envoy, Number Two!</p><p>How did these two get together? Did the Holy Divine Palace send someone over again? Why did Number Two call out the Saint’s name?</p><p>Lock onto the position!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao, that d*ned woman, must have told Number Two about the baseless judgment she made about him in the deep sea. His attempt to be involved with the Holy Emperor person and how he had ‘forcefully killed’ Teng Shanhai in her presence. These were all groundless and definitely exaggerated crimes that she told Number Two.</p><p>Who was Number Two?</p><p>It was a masterpiece created from Dao Qiongcang’s Divine Secret. It was known as the strongest among the Demi-Saints. It was close to a hexagonal warrior that had no blind spots and weaknesses. It was born to kill in the name of judgement.</p><p>Even if Jiang Buyi was confident that everything could be explained when he was targeted by this guy, he would only be qualified to explain after he had the strength to resist.</p><p>Now that he faced the countdown to exile, he couldn’t do anything!</p><p>He even became a beggar after he discarded his dignity as a Demi-Saint, and left after he accepted the 50 Void Crystals.</p><p>Jiang Buyi had never broken his promise to anyone in his entire life – Even if he had never made any promises to the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. Now that he thought about it, he felt embarrassed.</p><p>However…</p><p>He couldn’t care less!</p><p>He had only attacked once, and there were only three days left on the countdown to exile.</p><p>Danger abounded in the Abyss Island; dignity was not as important as one’s life.</p><p>The only thing that Jiang Buyi could think of now was to rush back to Zhen Huang Palace and exchange for the exemption order. As long as the countdown was lifted, there was nothing he could not do!</p><p>“That’s right…”</p><p>Jiang Buyi suppressed his curiosity about the person who had called out his name and did not look for him. He recalled the battle royale earlier and thought of something.</p><p>When he accepted Void General Sin’s mission, he received a golden water droplet. Through that strange water droplet, he could see the real-time image of Ye Xiao.</p><p>He wasn’t there right now, but he could use the golden water droplet to take a peek?</p><p>Jiang Buyi was too afraid of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man!</p><p>This guy had no scruples and killed whoever he saw. He was like a mad dog and even Ye Xiao had not been spared.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was even worried that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man actually wanted to kill him. However, they were afraid of his hidden trump card and did not dare to make a move.</p><p>This person was bold but cautious.</p><p>When he was at his weakest and restricted, he did not choose to attack. He was too wise!</p><p>But up till now, Jiang Buyi still did not understand the true purpose of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s trip.</p><p>In order to exterminate Xu Xiaoshou, regardless if he was still alive or not, he killed so many people along the way, but let him off?</p><p>“He definitely wants to kill me. He definitely lacks a semi-saint person…”</p><p>Jiang Buyi was well aware of the most valuable thing he had. He did not believe that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man did not have a trick up his sleeve.</p><p>Perhaps, while he targeted Ye Xiao, he also had some unknown plans against him.</p><p>In that case…</p><p>“Can I exchange the exemption order safely?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s keen intuition told him that this journey back to Zhen Huang Palace might be filled with hidden and great risks.</p><p>He reached into his clothes to check out the golden drop of water and see if the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was still with Ye Xiao. If not, it must have pursued him secretly.</p><p>But…</p><p>His hand came out empty!</p><p>At this moment, cold sweat dripped down Jiang Buyi’s back, and his face turned pale.</p><p>He tried hard to recall. With the Demi-Saint’s amazing memory, he still couldn’t recall when he had lost the golden drop.</p><p>“I lost it…”</p><p>“What would happen if I lose it?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s eyes narrowed, then he opened his eyes.</p><p>He thought for a moment, then pulled out a strand of white hair from his head. He transformed into a Demi-Saint incarnation, and fled to the other side. Only then did he move toward Zhen Huang Palace at full speed.</p><p>The unknown always made people afraid.</p><p>However, Demi-Saints were fearless!</p><p>If he, Jiang Buyi, could regain his Demi-Saint Stage strength, he would be able to fight even if Rao Yaoyao and Number Two came to condemn him in the First Hall of Sins.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
