(4)</p><p>At the thought of this, Elder Han shuddered and hurriedly cut off his train of thought.</p><p>Goodness, if he continued to think about it, he would die!</p><p>“It’s time to go out.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t plan to stay in the Frost World any longer. Even if Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison’s power was isolated here, he wouldn’t appear even if he called out the name of this Saint.</p><p>He looked at Elder Han and said.</p><p>“After we get out, one, don’t call me Brother Chen Tan. Call me Brother Chen.”</p><p>“Secondly, our identities are very special. We all have three levels… My name is Chen Shu now, but I’m actually Chen Tan. My real identity is Chen Ruye of the Xu Yue Grey Palace. You’re a Ghost Beast, an actual Ghost Beast. You’re a founding elder Ghost Beast from the Xu Yue Grey Palace.”</p><p>“Third, your current target is too big. Transform into your Ghost Beast form and then reduce your size.”</p><p>Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>The Gu brothers waited quietly. The Elder Gu was still calm, but Gu Qinger was a little anxious.</p><p>“Eldest Senior Brother, it’s been so long and he still has not come out. Could it be that Brother Chen had been possessed? Elder Han’s holy realm is a little difficult to break if you don’t summon the Sword Demon!”</p><p>“No, it can’t be.”</p><p>“How can you still be so calm? He’s my savior!”</p><p>“He’s not mine.”</p><p>“You… Humph!”</p><p>The Sword Demon felt that it was too boring and had already returned to Gu Qingyi’s soul space.</p><p>Other than the noisy Gu Qinger, it was very quiet in the great hall. The giant statue did not speak at all.</p><p>Occasionally, Gu Qinger would also quieten down, and the only sound that could be heard from time to time was the sound of a small pool of water that froze into ice.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>Suddenly, the Frost World lifted and Chen Shu returned.</p><p>Gu Qingyi turned to look. Chen Shu, who had just finished his private conversation did not seem to display any traces of having gone through a battle. It was just that Elder Han had disappeared.</p><p>Gu Qingyi’s eyebrows shot up.</p><p>This was unbelievable. The Ghost Beast at the Demi-Saint level had transformed into such a small and cute form and now stood together with Brother Chen?</p><p>“You are Elder Han!”</p><p>However, Gu Qinger suddenly jumped out and pointed angrily at Chen Shu and shouted.</p><p>“If you know what’s good for you, you’d better release my Brother Chen immediately. If you want a Ghost Beast host body, you can look for another one, but this person is not someone you can mess around with! Do you believe that I can ask my Senior Brother to summon the Sword Demon?”</p><p>“Ji!”</p><p>Elder Han perched on Xu Xiaoshou’s shoulder suddenly exclaimed. Gu Qinger finally saw the little thing. “Ah?” He was stunned.</p><p>“It’s settled.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou spread his hands, nodded at Gu Qinger and indicated that he was fine.</p><p>Only then did he turn to Gu Qingyi with a smile. “I know Chen Tan. I just had a chat with Elder Han. He’s currently being hunted down and wants to seek refuge with me for the time being.”</p><p>“Ji!”</p><p>Elder Han’s two small front paws tugged at his long beard and he cried out. He stood on Brother Chen’s shoulder and moved back and forth as if his feet had been scalded.</p><p>Oh my God!</p><p>Why does my feet feel as if they had been pricked?</p><p>In the end, he was still not used to it, so he jumped on top of Brother Chen’s head and suddenly realized that…</p><p>His disheveled hair was also so sharp and prickly!</p><p>Helplessly, he could only use his frost power to condense a layer of ice crystals on the padding under his claws to resist the Sharpness…</p><p>When he was in such a small Ghost Beast form, Elder Han’s power had been reduced by more than 90%.</p><p>But at the same time, this aura could be better concealed.</p><p>At the very least, when he was not in his attack mode, even if he didn’t use the Legendary Beast Control Artifact, outsiders wouldn’t be able to tell that he was a Ghost Beast or that he had the power of a Ghost Beast.</p><p>“Are you really alright?”</p><p>Gu Qinger was still skeptical. He wanted to go forward and ask more questions, but his Senior Brother pulled him back. “It’s fine as long as we’re safe. What’s Brother Chen’s next step?”</p><p>Gu Qinger was a little dissatisfied. He was really concerned.</p><p>Gu Qingyi glared at him coldly and did not allow his junior brother to speak.</p><p>Chen Tan and Chen Shu, now that he thought about it, perhaps it was like the relationship between Gu Qingyi and Gu Qinger.</p><p>Elder Han was a Ghost Beast, and these two Chens came from the Southern Region. There were many Ghost Beasts in the Southern Region, and the relationship between the two was too subtle.</p><p>Not to mention that the Ghost Beast was not something ordinary people could touch on the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>With Elder Han’s strength, when he stood on Chen Shu’s shoulder, it represented many things.</p><p>Gu Qingyi was already unwilling to listen any more. Nothing good would come out from any contact with a Ghost Beast. This was what his Supreme Master had told him before.</p><p>Of course, he did not want his junior brother to put himself in danger and continue to be indebted because he had been his savior.</p><p>“I’ve basically settled all my affairs. Thank you for bringing me to Zhen Huang Palace, Brother Gu. There’s no need for you to accompany me from now on. It’s very dangerous.” Xu Xiaoshou knew that it was time to say goodbye.</p><p>“Ah, how can this be…”</p><p>Gu Qingyi stopped Gu Qinger before he could finish his sentence. “Since that’s the case, the road to the martial arts world is long. We’ll meet again if fate permits.”</p><p>After he said that, he dragged his Second Brother and walked out of Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>“Eldest Senior Brother, this matter is not over…”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>“I still have many questions…”</p><p>“Did I allow you speak?”</p><p>“..%&*”</p><p>Amid Gu Qinger’s indistinct curses, Gu Qingyi suddenly stepped on the melting ice water, stopped and looked back.</p><p>“Brother Chen!”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked up. He had been watching as they left.</p><p>With just a glance, Gu Qingyi’s Sword Will was faintly activated. Xu Xiaoshou felt that his spiritual body had been brought into another world.</p><p>Instinctively, the Heart Sword Technique was almost activated, but he quickly suppressed it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
