(2)</p><p>Even so, Elder Han still obediently took out a green stone the size of a baby’s fist from his bosom.</p><p>He squeezed the green stone and slowly injected his Holy Power into it. The Frost World seemed to be plated with a layer of green film, and all the power stilled and it felt like it had been sealed.</p><p>For a moment, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t even feel the cold.</p><p>He shifted his covetous gaze from the green stone in Elder Han’s hand. He knew that this was a treasure that could rival his Holy Emperor Dragon Scale!</p><p>“What do you want to do?”</p><p>Elder Han’s eyes narrowed and he quickly put away the green stone and dared not show off any more.</p><p>This kid’s cultivation level doesn’t seem high, so why is he even more brutal than me? Could it be that he wanted to snatch my treasure just now?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked intently at Elder Han. “If you want to carry out your Possession, now is your best chance. ”</p><p>Elder Han was moved.</p><p>This kid was right.</p><p>If he carried out his Possession now, the Sword Demon would not be able to break through the defenses of his Frost World with the isolation of the Holy Emperor’s power.</p><p>At that time, he could escape along the Path Principles of the Abyss Island.</p><p>The Sword Demon’s technique was strong, but in terms of comprehension of the Great Path, it was weak. If he ran, it would probably not even be able to touch him.</p><p>What was a Frost Ferret? That was a species that excelled at running away. Even Rao Yaoyao, who had the Saint Calamity on her head, couldn’t stop him.</p><p>If Elder Han really wanted to run, even a Demi-Saint wouldn’t be able to catch up with him.</p><p>As for the humiliation earlier…</p><p>It was purely by accident that he was hugged by the Sword Demon just now, alright?</p><p>Who would have thought that any random Ancient Swordsman could summon the Sword Demon?</p><p>Furthermore, this Sword Demon was not in its infancy stage. It was a mature form, and its combat strength was close to that of Bazhun’an!</p><p>In fact, when he was being hugged and was on the verge of death, Elder Han had doubts whether he would survive and did not even look for a chance to escape.</p><p>Times had changed?</p><p>I can’t even beat a young man now?</p><p>“What are you trying to say? If you continue to talk nonsense, I will really use the Possession on you!” Elder Han’s big eyes widened as he stroked his tail fur and threatened him in a fierce yet adorable manner.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed. After he eliminated this final possibility, he could talk about serious matters with peace of mind.</p><p>“I am Chen Tan!”</p><p>His expression changed, and he immediately reverted to his previous appearance. He even added, “In the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes, I, Ye Xiao, Rao… Demi- Saint, she broke your seal with a single strike.”</p><p>At this moment, Elder Han’s pupils quivered. He was so frightened that he almost pulled his tail out from behind his waist. He took a big step back.</p><p>“You, you, you…”</p><p>His fingers trembled and he couldn’t speak. He thought of the nonsense he made up in front of Gu Qingyi.</p><p>Damn it, the main character had been listening from the side?</p><p>“You can fool them, but you can’t fool me.” Xu Xiaoshou pinched his chin. “Tell me, who are you? Well… If you still want to use the Possession on me, go ahead and attack.”</p><p>Elder Han felt like he was being controlled.</p><p>In that instant, even though he was afraid, yet he was struck by happiness.</p><p>This was because the host body he coveted in the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes had descended from the sky. Even if it was not the ice-type element, the aura of the power of the evil god and the attainment in the spiritual array would be of great help to him.</p><p>However, Chen Tan was too good at this. When he said that, Elder Han didn’t dare to move.</p><p>“You brat…”</p><p>Elder Han sighed and shook his head. He sized up the young man in front of him and suddenly laughed out loud. “Ha…ha…ha…”</p><p>“Are you crazy?” Xu Xiaoshou frowned.</p><p>“You brat… Speak! Why do you know the Third Ancestor of the White Vein?” Elder Han’s eyes widened in anger. After he learned of Chen Tan’s true identity, this young man’s mysterious veil had been torn apart. He no longer had any scruples.</p><p>“You seem to have forgotten that I’m the one with the upper hand now.” Xu Xiaoshou felt the strong aura of the Demi-Saint. He raised his eyebrows and his aura rose. He was not at a disadvantage at all.</p><p>“Impudent!” Elder Han’s ice wings spread open. “I haven’t even settled with you about what happened in the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes. Who do you think you are to talk to me like that? You also have a Sword Demon?”</p><p>In the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes, it was because Chen Tan had turned the tables and ratted on him. This transformed Rao Yaoyao into a rabid dog and she chased after him in the midst of the ‘transcend the tribulation’.</p><p>Heaven indeed had mercy on him. Elder Han had never seen such a lunatic before!</p><p>This was a ‘transcend the tribulation’!</p><p>He was still going through the Demi-Saint Tribulation!</p><p>A normal person would have made careful preparations. That crazy woman carried the Cang Godhood Sword and broke the Thunder Calamity with one strike. After that she still dared to cut him with the next sword strike.From the First Hall of Sins to the Abyss Island, the path was riddled with sword light and lightning.</p><p>Elder Han had lost half of his forearm and was almost severely injured by the Thunder Calamity and the sword energy.</p><p>This was the critical period of Rao Yaoyao’s ‘transcend the tribulation’.</p><p>He took advantage of the fact that the crazy woman didn’t dare to be distracted and was focused on her ‘transcend the tribulation’. Elder Han evaded her and finally managed to escape.</p><p>Now, the instigator who created that vicious dog still dared to be so arrogant in front of him?</p><p>How arrogant you are!</p><p>I’ll slash you to bits!</p><p>Under the cover of the Frost World, the more Elder Han thought about it, the angrier he got. He straightened his wings and turned them into icicles, ready to use them.</p><p>I won’t stab you to death, but I’ll give you a few bloody holes first. This is to let you know that some people can’t be provoked, especially a Demi- Saint!</p><p>A Saint should not be humiliated!</p><p>“I’m convinced.”</p><p>When he saw that Elder Han wanted to charge at him, Xu Xiaoshou was amused.</p><p>This guy was really weak and easy irritated. His endurance power was low and his attacks weren’t thorough enough.</p><p>If you really had the guts, you would have directly used the Possession on me right now. What’s the point of launching physical attacks?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
