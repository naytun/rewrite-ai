(4)</p><p>“I will get everything I lost before back!”</p><p>“Five Decays of Heaven and Man!”</p><p>“God Devil Eyes!”</p><p>“Wait for my revenge!”</p><p>With a whoosh, Jiang Buyi’s hand passed through an exemption order with the belief of revenge.</p><p>Hmm?</p><p>Through…</p><p>Passed through?</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>His heart suddenly contracted.</p><p>At this moment, Zhen Huang Palace became dead silent.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s hair bristled in anger. He suddenly stared at Yu Lingdi.</p><p>“You dare to tease me?!”</p><p>However, after he shouted, Jiang Buyi was shocked. Even Yu Lingdi’s eyes were also filled with astonishment.</p><p>He didn’t do it?</p><p>“Whoa!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi grabbed again.</p><p>His hand passed through the exemption order again.</p><p>“Whoa! Whoosh! Whoa!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi grabbed it several times, and Yu Lingdi held an exemption order. It was in front of them!</p><p>However, no matter how much power Jiang Buyi used, or even if he had used Holy Power, there seemed to be an entire world between him and the exemption order. He only looked at it but could not get it.</p><p>“There is no need to try, Jiang Buyi.”</p><p>“Don’t you think it’s ridiculous to scratch and touch it like this repeatedly?”</p><p>A mocking voice came from outside the hall.</p><p>Yu Lingdi and Jiang Buyi suddenly turned their heads to look in shock.</p><p>Outside the great array of Zhen Huang Palace, a gap had appeared. A gold robe-masked man stood on the top, carrying a saber and a sword.</p><p>He was so calm, and his eyes were filled with tranquility under the mask.</p><p>“He is Huang Quan!” Yu Lingdi cried out involuntarily.</p><p>So, the reason Jiang Buyi could not get the exemption order was because of Huang Quan’s power of Space-Time?</p><p>“Hurry up! Grab me…”Yu Lingdi suddenly stretched out his hand, wanting to pull Jiang Buyi and use the connection to let them be together.</p><p>“Whoa.”</p><p>The air fell silent.</p><p>Yu Lingdi stared blankly as his hand passed through Jiang Buyi’s chest like a phantom.</p><p>This man was in sight, but they were in different space times.</p><p>The battlefield had been divided!</p><p>“Huang Quan!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi felt irritated a lot.</p><p>How long had he waited?</p><p>He felt he had waited for a century!</p><p>He made more effort to find the exemption order. But the evil man—Huang Quan, sent it to another world!</p><p>“Ah-eh?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi was in shock again as the explosion could be heard, but the roar stopped abruptly.</p><p>A folding fan suddenly appeared in the back of Yama Chief Huang Quan. And it locked the spontaneous repair gap of the great array of Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>Then, a gentle and kind elderly man walked out.</p><p>He took two steps forward and stopped with Huang Quan on abreast. He smiled and looked over without saying anything.</p><p>There was a sound of opening the folding fan.</p><p>With a flick of the folding fan, it opened.</p><p>A gentle breeze blew past. He saw four big words on the fan.</p><p>“Long time no see.”</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Buyi’s heart beat at an extreme speed.</p><p>His initially pale face turned red due to the sudden loss of control of the blood in his body.</p><p>He was Mei Siren!</p><p>Mei Siren and Huang Quan stayed together?</p><p>What happened? What did they want to do?</p><p>“Yo.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi thought of something briefly, and his expression returned to normal. He said, grinning, “What are you doing? We…”</p><p>Jiang Buyi glanced over at Huang Quan and Mei Siren, saying, “Seems like we’ve only met with each other once. What is this situation? If we didn’t fight before, we wouldn’t be friends. Haha.”</p><p>But no one laughed.</p><p>Jiang Buyi gave a short laugh and stopped smiling.</p><p>He fought with Huang Quan and Five Decays of Heaven and Man in the deep sea. During the fighting, they were in transmission to different places.</p><p>In the Forest of Miracles, he fought with Mei Siren again.</p><p>“Oh, this situation was good. These two men were standing together. Although it was bewildering, they wanted to kill me, and it hadn’t a solution to resolve.”</p><p>“At least, they probably didn’t know that I had the ‘countdown to exile,’ right?” Jing Buyi thought.</p><p>“The Five Decays of Heaven and Man mentioned that Demi-Saint Jiang has a ‘countdown to exile.’ How is it? Did you get the exemption order?” Huang Quan said.</p><p>He glanced over the exemption order in Yu Lingdi’s hand as he spoke.</p><p>Jiang Buyi couldn’t control his emotion.</p><p>“D*mn it, Five Decays of Heaven and Man!”</p><p>“F*ck you!”</p><p>“How could he… How could he fight with me while sending a message to Huang Quan and Mei Siren?”</p><p>“How could he call over these two b*stards simultaneously?”</p><p>“It’s a good way if you’re a little slower!”</p><p>“I knew that from the beginning; you had bad intentions. You tricked me into entering the First Hall of Sins and monopolized the Void Crystals.”</p><p>“The key is that you don’t dare to fight with me when you’re alone…”</p><p>“Excellent!”</p><p>“It was too Excellent!”</p><p>“No, it should be roguery!”</p><p>“Five Decays of Heaven and Man is so treacherous that I want to kill him variously!” Jiang Buyi thought.</p><p>Even though Jiang Buyi was simmering with rage, he couldn’t help making plaint that Five Decays of Heaven and Man was so shameless.</p><p>He had such a good opportunity, but he didn’t take action.</p><p>After Jiang Buyi couldn’t endure his provocation, he fought with him repeatedly and wasted much countdown time.</p><p>As Jiang Buyi was about to release his combat strength, Five Decays of Heaven and Man called for Huang Quan and Mei Siren.</p><p>It was like feeding flies to one. What was simply disgusting!</p><p>“Where is Five Decays of Heaven and Man?” Jiang Buyi overlooked their behind and seemed forward to meeting Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>“He has a mission and won’t come here,” they said.</p><p>“If I fight with you, I can kill you one of two. If you call for the Five Decays of Heaven and Man now, none of you won’t die,” Jiang Buyi said and calmed down.</p><p>“No, He won’t come here, and you couldn’t kill one of us either.” Huang Quan refuted.</p><p>“You want to try?” Jiang Buyi flew into a rage. His entire body burst out, and he seemed to be releasing his sacred physique, turning into a celestial cloud.</p><p>“Yes.” Huang Quan nodded. “If you have any skills, feel free to use them. As long as you can smash this space-time world… I will improve to ten thousand layers! What about you? How many times can you fight with us? How many days do you have left?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
