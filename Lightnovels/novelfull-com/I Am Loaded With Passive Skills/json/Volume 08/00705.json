Once it was heard…</p><p>The entire place was dead silent!</p><p>It was so quiet that one could hear a pin drop.</p><p>“Come to my room!”</p><p>“My room!”</p><p>“My room!”</p><p>“Room!”</p><p>“Room!”</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p>Of course, Nangong Yin who was on the high platform, was one of them.</p><p>The small hammer in Nangong Yin’s hand fell with a thump. He didn’t even realize that it hit the wooden pallet. Clearly, he was still in a daze.</p><p>“It can’t be?”</p><p>Someone gulped with difficulty. He carefully probed, “This, could this be President Dong Ling’s voice?”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>…</p><p>No one responded.</p><p>Everyone present had question marks on their faces. How were they supposed to respond?</p><p>Actually, the speaker’s subconscious questioning tone had already revealed the shock in his heart and the answer.</p><p>There were many people who had the same answer as him.</p><p>Earlier, Nangong Yin asked the female owner of Room 183, President Dong Ling to put on the beast mask.</p><p>After a short rest, why did “President Dong Ling” become so… direct? Come to my room?</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>After a few breaths, the scene began to turn chaotic.</p><p>“There’s no doubt that Room 183 is the Magic Pill Technicians Association. But who’s it in Room 172, whom President Dong Ling has such a good relationship with?”</p><p>“To buy the Bodhi Root and give it to someone else?”</p><p>“Oh my God, come to my room… This ‘room’ should refer to ‘the private room’, right? Did I misunderstand? Hey, pinch me!”</p><p>“Ouch!”</p><p>“It’s not a dream! But why?”</p><p>“I’ve seen President Dong Ling before. She, she’s not such a person…”</p><p>At this moment, Hua Ying’s voice came to an end.</p><p>President Dong Ling’s lofty and proud image in the minds of countless people collapsed with a loud bang.</p><p>In Private Room 183, President Dong Ling’s body trembled after Hua Ying’s random words. She stared in astonishment at the speaker who behaved recklessly.</p><p>At this moment, the whispers of people outside the private room entered their ears so clearly.</p><p>The few elders beside President Dong Ling, including Shi Ti, silently stared at the ceiling. It was as if their six senses had been sealed and they didn’t hear anything.</p><p>However, a few elders’ ears stood up while slightly shaking. All of them were extremely curious about the discussions of the crowd.</p><p>Dong Ling muttered to herself.</p><p>She fell silent and appeared upset. Subconsciously, she was about to yell at them.</p><p>But that was Hua Ying, the Saint’s Envoy…</p><p>Thinking of this, Dong Ling took a deep breath, raised her chest, and exhaled</p><p>“Phew…”</p><p>Following which, she quietly put on the beast mask.</p><p>“Shut up! ! !”</p><p>Dong Ling suddenly let out a cold shout, and the entire arena of the trade fair exploded.</p><p>Shi Ti quivered since he was nearby. With a shift of his butt, he immediately distanced from her.</p><p>He knew that Dong Ling wasn’t someone to be trifled with.</p><p>The president of the capital’s Magic Pill Technicians Association wasn’t only skilled in conducting alchemy, she also mastered in the legendary Infernal lineage’s exceptional battle prowess.</p><p>She was not someone with a good temper!</p><p>The arena’s discussions immediately fell silent.</p><p>After Dong Ling’s shout, Nangong Yin reacted at the speed of light. He picked up the small hammer and quickly knocked a few times.</p><p>“Quiet, quiet. Loud chatter and noise are not allowed in the trade fair arena!”</p><p>Hua Ying also realized something at this moment.</p><p>Although she initially did not realize the trouble she had caused by speaking recklessly, she was then immediately alerted by the discussions below the stage, President Dong Ling’s clenched fists, and her angry voice.</p><p>“Um…” Hua Ying turned around with a troubled look. Her pretty face blushed and she was a little embarrassed. “Um, President Dong Ling, I did it by accident…”</p><p>Dong Ling waved her hand and said indifferently, “It’s alright.”</p><p>She looked calm and collected as if she had been completely vented out the accumulated anger with a furious shout.</p><p>However, Hua Ying’s eyes rolled and quickly glanced at the wine glass that was still in President Dong Ling’s hand, struggling to hold on…</p><p>The glass had already cracked!</p><p>It was not broken because of President Dong Ling’s powerful cultivation level. She was using her spiritual source to hold it!</p><p>“Um, hmm…”</p><p>Hua Ying scratched her head and looked around.</p><p>She saw the people around her looking at the sky, whistling silently, and flipping through the pill books… None of them thought of solving the matter.</p><p>At this moment, Hua Ying felt that she had returned to the Holy Palace.</p><p>At the scene, it was as if she had done something wrong and made her master, Bai Lian angry. Everyone was busy with own stuffs and had no time to take care of her.</p><p>At this time, how could any kind-hearted person risk his life to save her?</p><p>“It’s all your fault!” Hua Ying suddenly glared at Zhou Tianshen fiercely. She thought to herself, if Zhou Tianshen could give her a better suggestion, she wouldn’t have had such an idea.</p><p>Zhou Tianshen ran out of words.</p><p>He was confused.</p><p>Why on earth did the blame come back to him?</p><p>Obviously, Hua Ying had never thought of this…</p><p>The person she was relying on was not too smart either!</p><p>…</p><p>Room 172.</p><p>To be honest, the person who was most frightened by so-called President Dong Ling’s “come to my room” was none other than Xu Xiaoshou himself.</p><p>He even recalled it in his mind at the speed of light just now.</p><p>In the end, he failed to find any connection with the headquarters of the Magic Pill Technicians Association in the Imperial City.</p><p>Then, another female voice that had been modified by the beast mask appeared from Room 183. Xu Xiaoshou then realized that everyone had misunderstood.</p><p>That brainless “come to my room” did not come from President Dong Ling. It was from another brainless woman.</p><p>But the key point was…</p><p>“Why would a woman… want to give me a treasure in Room 183?” Xu Xiaoshou was puzzled.</p><p>At this moment, Mu Zixi came close to him with dark eyes. She seemed to be possessed and was extremely cold, “Xu Xiaoshou, have you been flirting around outside again?”</p><p>“No, don’t talk nonsense,” Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand.</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points + 3.”</p><p>“Nothing? And she’s giving you a treasure worth 3.1 billion?” Mu Zixi wrinkled her nose and snorted.</p><p>“I was wondering about this too…” Xu Xiaoshou was even more confused. He suddenly raised his eyebrows and thought of a possibility. “She wants to blackmail me?”</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou ignored his junior sister’s weird emotions. He was wondering if this was the other party’s tactic?</p><p>By offering to give away the treasure, he would stop bidding. Then, the other party would bid for the treasure, and then…</p><p>They would take back their words?</p><p>“What a good tactic!” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up, and he slapped his thigh.</p><p>This move was quite smooth!</p><p>If he were to do the same, he would definitely take back his words.</p><p>However, the opposite party was the headquarters of the Magic Pill Technicians Association…</p><p>“What the hell is going on?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was in a deadlock.</p><p>He felt that the Magic Pill Technicians Association had no reason to lie to him. Well, they were stingy, they would not give him a high-grade elixir master badge.</p><p>In essence, it was also because he blew up the Pill Pagoda…</p><p>However, he was not in Tiansang City at the moment, but in Dongtianwang City.</p><p>The other party would not resort to such a small trick!</p><p>“3.1 billion going once.”</p><p>“3.1 billion going twice.”</p><p>Below the stage, the black-robed beast-masked man, Nangong Yin, recollected after being dumbfounded for a while. He was knocking the small hammer against the wooden tray.</p><p>Mu Zixi anxiously stomped her feet on the side. She could not help but remind him, “Young Master Xu, I don’t think we can trust her. A woman’s heart is as unpredictable as the ocean. I think they are trying to cheat you. You must not go to their room.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was confused.</p><p>A woman’s heart is as unpredictable as the ocean… Where did she learn such words? She was just a little girl!</p><p>He did not make a sound. He even covered Mu Zixi’s mouth, not allowing her to interrupt at the critical moment.</p><p>There must be a mystery to this matter. He could wait for an opportunity to make a move.</p><p>To get a treasure as a gift was a good thing. Xu Xiaoshou had never rejected anyone.</p><p>If the opposite party did not give away the treasure in the end, they would invite accusations under the watchful eyes of everyone. Plus, they had made their identity clear.</p><p>After that, Xu Xiaoshou felt that if he wanted to stir up the Pill Pagoda again, he would have enough excuses.</p><p>“3.1 billion, three times, sold!”</p><p>“Let us congratulate Room 183 for buying the Bodhi Root, the supreme treasure derived from the Bodhi Ancient Wood, at the price of 31 Spirit Gem!”</p><p>The arena was filled with applause.</p><p>The drama was exciting, making everyone have mixed feelings.</p><p>After the small interlude of “come to my room”, almost everyone was stupefied. They were afraid of offering prices, let alone bidding for the treasure.</p><p>It was the same even for hegemonic powers such as the rGuiyin Pavilion and Great Xuantian Sect.</p><p>Thus, nobody made a noise.</p><p>But…</p><p>“This is strange!”</p><p>After the auction ended, all the top factions in the private rooms began to doubt the identity of Room 172.</p><p>What kind of person could make President Dong Ling befriend him in such a manner?</p><p>Obviously, that didn’t seem like the Holy Divine Palace!</p><p>Following which, some of the big shots in the private rooms tried and asked the Night Cat receptionist.</p><p>To their surprise, they received a firm reply.</p><p>“First Pavilion in the Sky?”</p><p>“Xu Deye?”</p><p>“Um, the newly emerging… Demi-Saint faction?”</p><p>After receiving a definite reply, the representatives of the various factions fell silent once more.</p><p>Although they had all sorts of information about the First Pavilion in the Sky before this, they didn’t take it to heart.</p><p>In a place like the Imperial City where various powerful factions were based in, a Demi-Saint faction in the Northern Region could hardly affect the overall situation.</p><p>But now…</p><p>If this faction had any connections with the Magic Pill Technicians Association, they would have to truly look into it.</p><p>At the same time, all the big shots in the rooms took out their communication bead and began to carefully make orders to their subordinates.</p><p>“Go. Find out everything about the First Pavilion in the Sky. Also, do your best to find out about the Northern Region.”</p><p>“Yes! But we don’t have… Well, we don’t have many people in the Northern Region, so we might be restricted…”</p><p>“Then, start with the First Pavilion in the Sky, investigate them step by step, including when did they enter the city, the people they have come into contact with in the past few months, and the things they have done… Find out everything.”</p><p>“The beast mask can hide a person’s voice, but there is no one in the Imperial City who can hide their identity!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>…</p><p>After the interlude.</p><p>The trade fair continued.</p><p>Night Cat’s Nangong Yin took out three supreme treasure items. Although there was a small hiccup, it undoubtedly set a good start.</p><p>At the same time, it set an example for all the faction that had attended the trade fair for the first time.</p><p>In the beginning, some people wanted to trade some “seemingly-good” treasures and try to make up for it in such a high-grade trade fair.</p><p>But with such a start, everyone gave up on the idea.</p><p>Not to mention that there were many big shots here, their eyes were bright.</p><p>Some weaker treasures might still be supreme in the outside world. But, at this moment, people were too embarrassed to trade them.</p><p>It was not that the treasures were bad, but the grade of this trading arena was really too high!</p><p>Room 172.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou silently watched the traders who took turns to go on stage from the private seats.</p><p>He didn’t buy any of the three treasures of the Night Cat.</p><p>The items traded by these people in the private seats were indeed very good, but in comparison, it was difficult for them to catch his attention.</p><p>He was only waiting.</p><p>After this group of people, the real giants in the private rooms would make their move.</p><p>At that time, it would be another climax of the trade fair.</p><p>While waiting, Liu Lu’s ears suddenly moved. As if he had received some instruction, he went up to Xu Xiaoshou’s side.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, the owner of Room 183 invited you to go over.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>As soon as these words were said, everyone was surprised.</p><p>Xin Gugu immediately stood up. He was the strongest bodyguard, so he had to do his duty and protect Xu Xiaoshou closely.</p><p>“So urgent, they can’t even wait for the trade fair to end?” Xu Xiaoshou was also surprised. The scene he had expected came surprisingly faster.</p><p>As the saying goes, if one offered hospitality for no reason, he would be either a traitor or a thief.</p><p>Previously, Xu Xiaoshou had strongly suspected that private room 183 was playing tricks. Now that the other party really wanted to invite him over, it meant that they really had something important to discuss.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Xu Xiaoshou said, “Reject them.”</p><p>Mu Zixi immediately turned her head and looked over. “Why? They want to give me the Bodhi Root. Isn’t that a good thing? Why don’t you accept it since it’s free?”</p><p>Liu Lu was also puzzled.</p><p>In his opinion, this was a treasure worth 3.1 billion.</p><p>That day, the deal between Young Master Xu and the Night Cat was only 3 billion. Young Master Xu seemed to be a little unwise.</p><p>With his money-minded character, how could he not want to take this treasure?</p><p>“Reject them.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou repeated the same thing.</p><p>After he finished speaking to Liu Lu, he glanced at his junior sister and sized her up before sighing.</p><p>“You are still too naive. Since she is offering a gift, she must have something to ask from me. In this situation, I am the one in charge. How can I move so easily?”</p><p>Naive…</p><p>Mu Zixi could not hear a single word from her senior brother after hearing that word.</p><p>She kept thinking about this word. She lowered her head and stared at her toes. Then, she slightly puffed up her chest. When she realized that it barely changed anything, her small face immediately became puffed with anger.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>Liu Lu hurriedly sent a message over.</p><p>Not long after, he received a reply. He looked at Xu Xiaoshou with a surprised expression, “Young Master Xu, there’s someone in Room 183 who wants to see you.”</p><p>This time, Xin Gugu, Xiao Wanfeng, and the others were slightly moved.</p><p>Young Master Xu really knew everyone’s mind!</p><p>“Impressed, Passive Points + 2.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled. He lifted his chin and waved his sleeves. He placed his hands behind his waist and paced a few steps. He paused for three breaths before nodding indifferently.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Damn it, it was awful… Mu Zixi pouted as she looked at this scene. Her eyes rolled up to the sky and she couldn’t help but mutter,</p><p>“Crazy!”</p><p>“Criticized, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>….</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
