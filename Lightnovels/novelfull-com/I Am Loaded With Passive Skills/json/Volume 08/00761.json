Hence, they did not wantonly violate the rules laid down by the Red Coats and White-clothed.</p><p>Not all the ghost beasts had stayed behind to await the trial’s conclusion.</p><p>Now that a crisis had struck, self-preservation was key.</p><p>Even if they could not protect others or cooperate with the upcoming investigation, nobody could fault them for putting their lives over everyone else, could they? Escaping to an area where the explosions were not so intense could hardly warrant criticism.</p><p>Therefore, higher-ups of Night Cat did not stop everyone from ‘protecting themselves.’</p><p>The Holy Divine Palace dared to move boldly, unafraid to incur public outrage.</p><p>Night Cat did not have the Palace’s courage!</p><p>–</p><p>In the middle of the Southern District…</p><p>Many fleeing Sovereign (Stage) masters did not stop even after the explosions died down.</p><p>Based on the principle of ‘if they’ve already run, why should they stop and hinder the senior Red Coats and White-clothed from capturing the Dark Faction’.</p><p>If they chose to stay, it would only increase the workload of the Red Coats and White-clothed factions, causing them to waste resources better spent elsewhere.</p><p>Hence, though the explosions had ceased, everyone still risked their lives to advance in the direction of their faction.</p><p>By then, the investigation team led by the Red Coats’s Night Guardian was unable to stop the escape of so many factions.</p><p>Even if they regrouped or awaited Rao Yaoyao’s arrival, it was too late. Blame could not be placed on those attending the trade fair for their reactions.</p><p>Everyone knew these faction heads were important personages of the imperial city.</p><p>As long as they joined forces, these faction heads could smother the consequences with a wave of a hand.</p><p>The Red Coats and White-clothed also knew these people did not want their dirty laundry aired in public.</p><p>Hence, using the chaos to their advantage was only natural…</p><p>What was wrong with that?</p><p>An alliance was one way to break the stalemate, and escaping was another.</p><p>Choosing either one would suffice, not to mention that they had a reasonable answer for their hasty flight…</p><p>“The Red Coats and White-clothed can’t protect everyone’s safety, so their choice to escape is the best choice.”</p><p>The Night Guardian could only split his subordinates into small teams with no other choices available, pursuing those few ghost beasts and organisations the Dark Faction suspected most.</p><p>There was no doubt the First Pavilion’s Night Guardian would launch an investigation!</p><p>–</p><p>Central Zone, close to the ground in mid-air…</p><p>Several figures were moving at lightning speed towards the direction of the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng was lying on Xin Gugu’s back, feeling the wind whipping against him and causing his face to sting.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng did not understand. Why did everyone run away?</p><p>Although the First Pavilion in the Sky was a little eccentric, there were always reasons for their actions. Young Master Xu only ever acted when necessary. The Red Coats and White-clothed could not control the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>Furthermore, he was a Demi-Saint’s descendant…</p><p>It was fine if others ran away.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng felt that he would stay until the end with the reputation of the First Pavilion in the Sky. After a White-clothed senior asked questions, Young Master Xu would act in his usual style. After criticising the White-clothed, everyone would be respectfully sent off by the other party, sent on their way to the Pilgrimage Tower in a palanquin…</p><p>That was how Young Master Xu did things. It was how the script was supposed to play out.</p><p>Unfortunately, things did not turn out the way he thought they would.</p><p>When the trade fair ended, a contingent of Red Coats and White-clothed seniors appeared out of nowhere, causing those of the First Pavilion in the Sky to feel uneasy.</p><p>It was a sign something was wrong.</p><p>At a certain moment, Xiao Wanfeng even felt that the White-clothed and Red Coats were there specifically for the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>Young Master Xu was the representative of the Dark Faction and the landlord for a certain ghost beast hiding in the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>Perhaps Brother Xin, who was carrying Young Master Xu on his back, was also a host body for a ghost beast.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng did not think much of it. He faced Feng Zhen and asked, “Brother Xin, are you a host body for a ghost beast?”</p><p>Xin Gugu did not even pause in his stride. He faced the wind and roared, “No.”</p><p>Spiritual cultivators could communicate calmly.</p><p>However, Xiao Wanfeng was just a mortal. Xin Gugu’s roar was also for Xiao Wanfeng to hear.</p><p>No one from the First Pavilion in the Sky had any strange reactions.</p><p>On the contrary, Xiao Wanfeng, who had asked if Xin Gugu was the ghost beast host body, was the one who was the most embarrassed.</p><p>He was silent for a while and then shouted, “Then why are we running?”</p><p>Xin Gugu scratched his head. He, too, did not know. “I don’t know! Everyone ran away. It seemed silly to stand still and wait in place. Do you think my answer is dumb?”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng thought to himself, “Huh?”</p><p>Brother Xin was simple-minded and did not know how to lie.</p><p>Things would have been different if the one answering was Young Master Xu.</p><p>There was no way Brother Xin was a ghost beast host body. He would have noticed the lie for what it was immediately through Brother Xin’s reaction.</p><p>He was not lying!</p><p>Brother Xin’s indifferent reaction was as if he was answering a common question.</p><p>The kind of ease with which Brother Xin had answered in could not be rehearsed or faked.</p><p>Following Xiao Wanfeng’s thoughts, If Brother Xin were a ghost beast host body, he would have been exposed long ago. He could not have survived till now.</p><p>The topic drew to an abrupt close. Anxiety still weighed heavily in the air.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng hesitated.</p><p>If it was not the ghost beast host body, why was everyone still so nervous?</p><p>Beside him was Aunt Mu, who was gritting her teeth and running wildly.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng could see that it would be a little difficult for her to keep up with Brother Xin’s Sovereign (Stage) cultivation with her meagre Innate cultivation.</p><p>Tilting his head, he shouted his question, “Aunt Mu, are we a Dark Faction? Like the Saint Servant?”</p><p>Mu Zixi held her breath for a long time before replying, “No!”</p><p>“If not, why is everyone so nervous? Why are you so pale?” Xiao Wanfeng felt that he had seen through her.</p><p>Mu Zixi took a deep breath and glared at Xiao Wanfeng. “Why are you asking so many questions? Just focus on running!”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng’s head retracted like that of a turtle, suitably cowed for the moment.</p><p>Piecing it all together… it made sense!</p><p>It felt so surreal…</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng’s sixth sense told him he only had half a foot in the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>He was not in Young Master Xu’s inner circle. Everyone else seemed to possess some tacit understanding of one another; everyone, except him.</p><p>This feeling…</p><p>How should he put it…</p><p>It felt like they were excluding him on purpose!</p><p>Thinking up to this point, Xiao Wanfeng could not help but turn around and sneak a peek at Young Master Xu being carried by Mo Mo.</p><p>Young Master Xu was the source of this surreal feeling.</p><p>It was as if…</p><p>… As if Young Master Xu was not a real person. It was as if the person he knew and the person before him were two different entities altogether.</p><p>Thus, Xiao Wanfeng shouted once again, “Young Master Xu, why are we running? Great Aunt Mu looks exhausted, and you don’t look too well either. Shouldn’t we stop for a break?”</p><p>Xin Gugu cursed angrily, “You are the type who loves talking, aren’t you? Why don’t we swap places, and you carry me for a while?”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng choked and did not dare reply.</p><p>He felt he had discovered a soft spot.</p><p>When it came to Young Master Xu, Brother Xin and everyone’s reactions became somewhat strange.</p><p>The wind careening past had not abated.</p><p>Everyone was still running wildly.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng could not see the other’s expressions clearly, but he could perceive that they all gave off a strange feeling, whether Mo Mo, Brother Xin, or Great Aunt Mu.</p><p>Young Master Xu was still in the Demi-saint’s state of Dao comprehension.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng did not even know what Young Master Xu had understood. The trade fair had ended, and he had not succeeded in comprehending the Dao.</p><p>He had failed at the critical juncture.</p><p>It was not Young Master Xu fault.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng wanted to say something to assuage his doubts when Young Master Xu, who was on Mo Mo’s back, suddenly called out.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Everyone was shocked, and their footsteps ground to a halt.</p><p>Even Xiao Wanfeng could not help but rub his eyes and look again. He felt that Young Master Xu seemed to have changed into a different person on Mo Mo’s back.</p><p>Although he was still very weak, his temperament had done a 180.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, is your Demi-saint Dao comprehension state over?”</p><p>The first person to be overjoyed was surprisingly Liu Changqing.</p><p>When the old man saw Young Master Xu wake from his state of grasping the Dao, the ecstasy in his heart was indescribable.</p><p>At this moment, Xiao Wanfeng could not sense the outside world.</p><p>The few people present could sense that the aura of the Red Coats’s Night Guardian was approaching rapidly.</p><p>“Young Master Xu?”</p><p>Mo Mo was also pleasantly surprised, putting Young Master Xu down.</p><p>“Xu…”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s small face immediately turned red. Her pale face suddenly regained its rosy tint after a pause. It was as magical as a painter’s brush painting.</p><p>“Hu~”</p><p>Xin Gugu let out a big sigh of relief and threw Xiao Wanfeng to the ground with a smack, the tension melting off his frame. “You’ve finally… recovered!” He said emotionally.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng took in everyone’s reactions.</p><p>He could see it.</p><p>Young Master Xu’s ‘Demi-saint’s Dao comprehension’ state seemed to have suddenly given everyone… the hope of life?</p><p>But why did everyone feel this way?</p><p>Life?</p><p>If Young Master Xu had not woken up, would they all have died?</p><p>Under Xiao Wanfeng’s puzzled gaze, Young Master Xu became radiant again after some exercises.</p><p>It was as if he had gone from a weakened state to his peak in an instant.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou arrived before the Night Guardian. After replacing Xu Xiaoji, he acted as if nothing had happened. It was as if the previous battle had nothing to do with him at all.</p><p>He only followed Xiao Wanfeng’s words and continued, “Xiao Wanfeng is right. I had an epiphany just now. Xiao Mo, your way of handling things is a little inappropriate.”</p><p>“There’s no need for us to run, but there’s also no need for us to stay there and paint targets on our backs.”</p><p>“We’ve already chosen to run. The real question is, why are we all running together?”</p><p>As soon as Xu Xiaoshou posed the question, Mo Mo secretly rolled her eyes. It was because she wanted to give this fellow face! Still, she bowed and apologised, “It’s my fault.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand, “You’re not wrong. What’s wrong is that everyone shouldn’t have chosen to run together. When chaos ensues, those who run will all be suspected. Since we have all become suspects, wouldn’t running together be suicide? What’ll happen if everyone is hauled in for interrogation?”</p><p>Liu Changqing saw that Young Master Xu could communicate and was extremely excited. “Then what does Young Master Xu mean?”</p><p>“Run in different directions, of course!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s senses prickled with the knowledge of some great danger approaching.</p><p>As for Mo Mo, Mu Zixi, and Xin Gugu, these three had all walked out from Tiansang City. The Night Guardian might have already investigated them.</p><p>Even if disguised, it was not impossible for someone to see through their get up.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not dare gamble on that slim off chance.</p><p>He had transformation and stealth, so he was not afraid of the Red Coat’s perception.</p><p>The others were not so lucky.</p><p>Waving his sleeve, he said to the other three, “Let’s split up and rendevous at the First Pavilion in the Sky.”</p><p>His three companions listened, stupefied.</p><p>Still, they did not think to argue. A unique fragrance wafted in the air, and there was no time for hesitation.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Under the watchful eyes of Xiao Wanfeng and Liu Changqing, the three of them pounced in three different directions, and their figures instantly disappeared.</p><p>Liu Changqing’s pupils constricted when he saw this.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>How did they vanish into thin air?</p><p>It was understandable that they could escape from his perception of the Cutting Path (Stage) with the cultivation level of the Sovereign (Stage) and some special ability.</p><p>But how did the Innate (Stage) Mu Zixi and Mo Mo do it?</p><p>Even the ghost beast host body couldn’t do it, could it?</p><p>There was also that barely discernable flux of spatial power just now…</p><p>Was it a super teleportation ability Young Master Xu had comprehended after his Demi-saint’s Dao comprehension state ended, teleporting them away?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had waved his hand to move the three of them into the Yuan Mansion, did not pay attention to the strange gazes of Xiao Wanfeng and Liu Changqing.</p><p>Unable to hold in his curiosity, Liu Changqing asked, “Young Master Xu, what about me?”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated for a moment and said telepathically, “Communicate with the one in your body. He doesn’t want to die either. The divine secret technique can save your life. You should run!”</p><p>Liu Changqing: ? ? ?</p><p>He could feel the difference in treatment.</p><p>Once Young Master Xu’s Demi-saint’s Dao comprehension state ended, he could teleport the other three away first. Yet, he alone… was Young Master Xu asking him to save himself?</p><p>Liu Changqing, who had wandered the world for a long time, suddenly understood something.</p><p>He had just joined the First Pavilion in the Sky. It was normal for Young Master Xu not to trust him.</p><p>Fu Zhuzhen had been treated like this. A chill crept into Liu Changqing’s heart.</p><p>People did not like being treated differently.</p><p>The one treated differently was the one who was not valued.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou naturally knew what Liu Changqing was thinking.</p><p>However, his Yuan Mansion World was fragile and could not manage unstable factors.</p><p>Therefore, he had no choice. He could only meet this injustice upon Liu Changqing!</p><p>“Changqing…” Xu Xiaoshou sighed and said earnestly, “There are some things that are not as simple as you think. The Demi-saint faction of the First Pavilion in the Sky needs to test your loyalty.”</p><p>“The only thing that I can remind you of…”</p><p>“In your current state, walking in the direction of the good is a broad and broad path. If you go in the direction of the bad, there will be endless disasters.”</p><p>“The choice is up to you.”</p><p>“The door of the First Pavilion in the Sky will always be open to you. Turn this situation to your advantage and clear the obstacles, barring your understanding of the divine secret technique. Breaking out of this encirclement isn’t as hard as you think.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze was sincere. He paused for a moment before saying, “After you have mastered your abilities, you can decide whether or not you want to return.”</p><p>Liu Changqing’s hands balled into fists, moved beyond belief.</p><p>He did not expect Young Master Xu to have made such considerations for him. To think his attention all along had been to expedite his fusion with the ghost beast.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>If Young Master Xu did not help, the only thing that could help him was the ghost beast’s divine secret technique.</p><p>If Liu Changqing and the ghost beast were able to accept each other, the divine secret technique would attain new heights!</p><p>To Liu Changqing, the First Pavilion in the Sky represented freedom and choices.</p><p>“Young Master Xu’s foresight is too far-reaching!” Liu Changqing exclaimed.</p><p>His thoughts had been too shallow!</p><p>He had not even begun pondering this problem, but Young Master Xu had already grasped his thoughts and the ghost beast’s powers combining and expanding upon them in his extrapolations.</p><p>He had not expected it to be like this.</p><p>Liu Changqing had never seen such a mastermind before.</p><p>After catching a glimpse of the future Young Master Xu’ laid bare, Liu Changqing did not think any other choice would be better than this.</p><p>After all, Young Master Xu was the one who gave him the chance to have a heart-to-heart talk with the ghost beast.</p><p>Liu Changqing’s hesitation disappeared. The emotions in his eyes were sincere as he solemnly said, “Young Master Xu, don’t worry. I will survive this calamity on my own. However, I will return to the First Pavilion in the Sky and help Young Master Xu!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded his head in satisfaction. “It’s best if you don’t misunderstand me.”</p><p>Hence, Xiao Wanfeng watched Liu Changqing leave with excitement after hearing this confusing exchange.</p><p>“Wh-what about me?”</p><p>He looked at the street that had suddenly become empty. The corner of his lips trembled as he asked in a trembling voice, “Young Master Xu, how do I run? With my feet?”</p><p>“You don’t have to run…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but laugh as he knocked on the young man’s head. It was too stupid and cute. Running with his feet…</p><p>He collected his thoughts and flicked his sleeves. He looked at the group of blurry Red Coats that had appeared at the end of the long street in the distance and calmly said, “It’s a pleasure to have friends come from afar.”</p><p>“Set the table and brew a pot of tea, Xiao Wanfeng.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
