Boom! Boom!”</p><p>The rain heavily poured .</p><p>The entire night sky of Dongtianwang city was covered by a curtain of rain, becoming hazy and blurry.</p><p>The rain continued to fall, like a song played by the sky. From the beginning of the continuous momentum, it turned into a climax.</p><p>“PFFT! PFFT!”</p><p>On the Long Street.</p><p>The little girl in Xu Xiaoshou’s arms looked at the straw hat that suddenly appeared, heard the strange sound that suddenly appeared in her ears, and then felt Xu Xiaoshou’s burning body.</p><p>At the first moment, he felt that something was wrong.</p><p>“Big Brother, I suddenly don’t want to be held by you anymore…”</p><p>He finished his sentence.</p><p>The little girl’s hand that was holding the stick of ice-sugar gourd suddenly stretched out.</p><p>In an instant, it pierced through Xu Xiaoshou’s chest.</p><p>“Sizzle”</p><p>Blood splattered.</p><p>In an instant, the blood was washed away by the storm.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>“Bewitched, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>“Watched, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Attacked, passive points + 1.”</p><p>The reality of the information bar suddenly broke into Xu Xiaoshou’s higher void (level) state. He escaped from the bewitched state and returned to his consciousness in the real world.</p><p>His eyes widened in anger.</p><p>This time, the pain made Xu Xiaoshou realize that it was real.</p><p>On the long street on a rainy night, as his eyes woke up, two dazzling white lights suddenly exploded.</p><p>“PFFT –”</p><p>A faint sound was heard.</p><p>The torrential rain, however, the moment Xu Xiaoshou opened his eyes, was instantly burned to ashes by the terrifying heat wave that burned the sky and boiled the sea.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>The little girl’s pupils constricted.</p><p>At that moment, he could sense that within a few miles, including the sky, not a single drop of rain could seep in.</p><p>It was a brand new domain!</p><p>And the one who did all of this seemed to be this young man in front of him?</p><p>Wasn’t he an innate (stage)?</p><p>In her daze, the little girl wanted to stop and escape from the dangerous situation.</p><p>But at this moment, he suddenly felt a huge force coming from his forearm.</p><p>It was the force from Xu Xiaoshou’s grip.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I suddenly don’t want it, so I brought you to buy ice-sugar gourd…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said in a low voice, and the close-bounds force field suddenly expanded.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>The air rippled suddenly.</p><p>The little girl in front of his chest, who was held by his hands, seemed to have been cut into powder and died on the spot.</p><p>“Higher void (level) …”</p><p>He looked at the empty chest and the remaining bloody hole in his chest.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that it was not that simple.</p><p>The little girl would definitely not die.</p><p>He must have used an indescribable strength to break free from his restraint and escape.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>He shivered at an inappropriate time.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were about to turn white as he felt the intense and comfortable transformation of his body.</p><p>The effect of “Eternal vitality” was very good.</p><p>However, it was obviously not good enough. When the little girl pulled her hand out, she instantly healed his physical injuries.</p><p>Every cell in his body seemed to be expanding and groaning comfortably after absorbing the full and pure energy.</p><p>This state was even more unprecedented.</p><p>“Holy Blood!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou understood that this was the effect of the holy blood given to him by Elder sang.</p><p>After returning from the higher void (level), Xu Xiaoshou did not obtain anything substantial.</p><p>The power of the higher void (level), the caring elder sang, had already transferred everything substantial into his consciousness.</p><p>With a thought.</p><p>It could be used immediately.</p><p>The first drop of holy blood entered his body. Obviously, when the elder sang knew that his disciple (apprentice) might trigger the higher void (level), he was already so weak that he could not even complete the action of “Taking out the holy blood and drinking it”.</p><p>Therefore, he took it automatically.</p><p>“Roar –”</p><p>The moment the spiritual source in his sea of Qi and the energy reserve in his body reached the next level, Xu Xiaoshou let out a low roar and started to ascend into the sky.</p><p>The white flame burned.</p><p>His eyebrows, hair, and clothes… were all decorated with a holy color.</p><p>Under the rainy night, this dazzling white light suddenly descended on the completely dark Dongtianwang city like godhood.</p><p>“Holy Power?”</p><p>At the end of the Long Street.</p><p>The little girl, who had escaped the attack, was in a daze. She looked at Xu Xiaoshou, who had undergone a heaven-shaking transformation for no reason.</p><p>“What’s going on…”</p><p>At this time, the little girl could not even react in time.</p><p>In the rhythm of his time, Xu Xiaoshou had only carried him and ran a few steps. After a pause, a straw hat appeared on his head.</p><p>After that, his entire person changed qualitatively!</p><p>And,</p><p>Holy Power!</p><p>“Where did you get Holy Power?”</p><p>The little girl exclaimed in shock. She was far away, but he could not help but ask curiously in his heart.</p><p>If he had been protected by holy power earlier, Xu Xiaoshou would not have been bewitched by him. He would have been completely in control of that body.</p><p>But now.</p><p>This unbelievable thing happened after the straw hat appeared!</p><p>“Sang Qiye?”</p><p>Before she could answer, the little girl had already thought of the answer.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou flew into the air. His entire body was convulsing. After he managed to get used to it, he heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>“Ha ~”</p><p>It was clearly just a soft cry.</p><p>The next second.</p><p>“Rumble –”</p><p>The Long Street sank three feet into the ground, the houses collapsed, and the earth shook and the mountains shook.</p><p>The space rippled, the ten directions cracked, and a black hole appeared faintly.</p><p>Ten miles away, it was even shattered into darkness and nothingness because of the pressure of the holy power.</p><p>However, the fantasy realm could not cover up the truth under the Holy Power.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked around and understood that he was in the bounded domain of the enemy.</p><p>“Your reaction is very fast. As expected of the higher void (level) …”</p><p>After a pause, Xu Xiaoshou’s focus, under the support of the Holy Power, penetrated through the illusion and looked at the little girl at the end of the Long Street who had dodged far away.</p><p>“Tell me your name!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou asked in a serious tone, “Who are you?”</p><p>Following his words.</p><p>Crack.</p><p>The power of bounded domain power was penetrated.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou’s explosive bear and White Flame’s gaze landed on her body, the little girl’s knees slightly bent, emitting the sound of bones cracking.</p><p>“Interesting…”</p><p>He was actually not surprised but delighted as if he was surprised by the explosive power of Xu Xiaoshou’s body.</p><p>“Chief of the other tribe, my name is Yi.”</p><p>The little girl asked in return, “What About You? Can you tell me how you managed to achieve the transformation on your body… from your master?”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Xu Xiaoshou did not reply. He only laughed heartily.</p><p>As time passed, he felt that the power in his body was getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>Demi-saint Infernal’s Saint Blood was too powerful!</p><p>It was like a bolt of lightning, constantly shuttling between his muscles, bones, and meridians, nourishing the origin nuclear energy and making it infinitely effective… it was simply marvelous!</p><p>Just as elder sang said, as a drop of holy blood specially made by an elixir master.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou consumed it, he didn’t even feel the slightest bit of violence or pain.</p><p>The only clear feedback he received was that it was powerful.</p><p>It was unparalleled, as powerful as if it could kill godhood or Buddha.</p><p>“Drink a drop of blood, learn a spiritual technique, and chop off a higher void (level) !”</p><p>Without any nonsense.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finished his sentence and holy power burst out from his body.</p><p>He didn’t use the virtual image that the elder sang left for him.</p><p>He had drunk the Holy Blood.</p><p>Then he would be a demi-saint on that day!</p><p>“Nine dragons burning the ancestor, open!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shouted in a low voice.</p><p>He bent his back and straightened his chest. His whole body was as straight as a spear.</p><p>Then.</p><p>With a boom, a thick white flame that was as thick as thunder was accompanied by a majestic and dense holy power. It was easy for his body to break through the bounded domain and reach the nine heavens.</p><p>After reaching its peak, the white flame of holy power bloomed like a flower in the dark night rain and scattered across the sky.</p><p>The world was completely silent at this moment.</p><p>The clouds dispersed and the rain disappeared.</p><p>The wind stopped and the rain stopped.</p><p>The silhouette of the dazzling, holy, and white flame seemed to become eternal in the night, becoming a stroke under the most dazzling and colorful night!</p><p>Yi was stunned.</p><p>He felt the holy power on Xu Xiaoshou’s body.</p><p>But he had never thought that the increase of holy power could be so fast?</p><p>Wasn’t he just a mere innate (stage)?</p><p>With such a measure of holy power bursting out, wasn’t he afraid of bursting himself?</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>Almost everyone in the entire Dongtianwang City had noticed this white flame holy rite.</p><p>At the trade fair.</p><p>Yao Rao and Wu Xia were confronting each other in the sky. At this moment, they couldn’t help but be attracted by the huge transformation in the central zone. They looked over with surprise.</p><p>“Holy power again?”</p><p>Red coat and white coat below.</p><p>Including the people at the scene of the trade fair who had their barrier blown up and could see the outside, they were also shocked.</p><p>“Holy Power?”</p><p>“The Holy Divine Palace sent out demi-saint this time?”</p><p>“Yao Yao, one of the seven sword deities, is at the scene. Who Is this demi-saint dealing with?”</p><p>At the scene of the battle in the Central Zone.</p><p>The storyteller, who was suppressed by Teng Shanhai, was able to escape in an instant.</p><p>Almost at the same time, after the two separated, they looked up with shock in their eyes.</p><p>“Holy Power?”</p><p>At that moment, one of them thought to himself, “The enemy tonight actually has someone who has the power of a demi-saint. Doesn’t that mean that only Yao Yao can deal with him?”?</p><p>The other thought to himself, “To deal with the saint servant, the Holy Divine Palace has even brought out a demi-saint this time?”?</p><p>Such a majestic holy power exploded in an instant.</p><p>The two who had observed the holy power in the past would never have thought that this scene was just the display of a holy statue.</p><p>On the other side, in the distance of the battle on Long Street.</p><p>The Mei Si people stopped in their tracks.</p><p>He looked at the holy power and suddenly burst out laughing.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>It turned out that he, the Mei Si people, had overestimated himself.</p><p>Although Xu Xiaoshou was only at the innate (stage), he was controlled by the higher void (level) with his innate (stage) body.</p><p>However, as the successor of You Tu’s will, how could the eight people who were destined to be controlled by the higher void (level) without any other means of resistance?</p><p>That young man.</p><p>Indeed, he looked like a young man.</p><p>However, he had placed a lot of bets on the chess masters.</p><p>Even if he did not enter the stage, it would not be so easy for him to fall into the hands of the Holy Divine Palace, right?</p><p>Mei Si held a folding fan in his hand. He thought for a moment and continued forward.</p><p>It could be said that he was one of the few people who knew the truth about the White Flame Holy Rite.</p><p>Naturally, he also knew.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could use the higher void (level) to fight against the higher void.</p><p>But in essence, he was only an innate (stage).</p><p>The higher void (level) opposite him had been famous for a long time.</p><p>Who could say that there wouldn’t be any more mishaps in between?</p><p>…</p><p>In the middle of the battle.</p><p>Looking at Xu Xiaoshou’s surging holy power, Yi was already so suppressed that he couldn’t even lift his head.</p><p>A mortal body.</p><p>Even if it was the higher void (level), how could it resist the power of a Saint?</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou really didn’t have the holy power alone.</p><p>“I didn’t expect that I, the chief of a different division, would have to use a drop of holy blood to capture a junior as the price…”</p><p>Yi Zaizai smiled bitterly.</p><p>Then, he took out a drop of golden holy blood and consumed it as well.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the same holy power exploded, and the pressure of the holy path could no longer control him.</p><p>“Little guy…”</p><p>Yi slowly took a step forward.</p><p>With this step, his little girl’s form underwent an earth-shaking transformation.</p><p>This time, he actually changed into elder Sang’s appearance.</p><p>That Straw Hat, that raincoat, that pair of big black eye circles.</p><p>Other than the teasing gaze in his black eye sockets, he did not look like elder sang at all.</p><p>Yi’s entire body was filled with elder sang’s the scent!</p><p>“My good disciple, are you going to kill your teacher?”</p><p>Yi’s expression suddenly became reserved, and even his gaze became the same as elder Sang’s. There was a strong sense of disappointment in his words.</p><p>However, at this moment, his bewitching power could no longer affect Xu Xiaoshou, who was possessed by holy power.</p><p>This time, the information bar did not even open.</p><p>“Killing your teacher…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was in the sky, laughed when he heard this.</p><p>Once upon a time, this was his only dream to become stronger!</p><p>“Infernal Heavens Burning!”</p><p>He didn’t waste any words.</p><p>He only shouted angrily.</p><p>The power of the infernal original seed in his body was completely detonated.</p><p>This was a power that even Elder Sang was amazed by. In terms of “Quality,” it had already surpassed the cutting path (stage). It was filled with calamity power. Even without the augmentation of holy power, it could still pose a threat to the cutting path (stage) and the higher void (level).</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rarely detonated the infernal original seed with his full strength.</p><p>That was because he could not withstand it.</p><p>But now that his body had recovered from the saint’s blood, he had the augmentation of holy power.</p><p>Detonating it like this.</p><p>Why Not?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lowered his eyelids from a long distance away and opened the divine gate in anger.</p><p>In an instant, the sound of PFFT could be heard endlessly.</p><p>White flame slapped the shore with the aura of a mountain flood and tsunami, overturning everything in all directions.</p><p>In an instant, it scorched the entire visible world.</p><p>The newly expanded bounded domain was like an object in a cauldron. In an instant, it was covered by white flame and burned to ashes.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt something in his heart. He thought of the scene in the eighth palace when elder sang rose from the Hundred Thousand Mountains to the entire world of white flame.</p><p>That was the power that he yearned for.</p><p>He didn’t dare to think about it in the past..</p><p>But now, he dared to think about it and still dare to do it!</p><p>“Dragon, Fuse, World!”</p><p>He raised his hands and pressed down again.</p><p>With a bang, the void shattered.</p><p>The originally restless five elements and six paths of the element, as well as the endless broken blades that flowed out from the spatial crack, were assimilated by the white color almost at the same time.</p><p>Ten miles of white flame.</p><p>A world was born!</p><p>..</p><p>“Crazy…”</p><p>On the other side, Yi was already going crazy from watching.</p><p>He wasn’t stunned by the beating.</p><p>He was stunned by the world-torturing scene before him.</p><p>Even though Yi had told himself countless times in his heart that even though this young man before him had drunk the Holy Blood and obtained the Holy Image…</p><p>His essence was still an innate (stage)!</p><p>However, who could tell him that there was an innate (stage) in this world that was as unreasonable as the person before him?</p><p>How much more than innate (stage) … No, not just the power of the cutting path (stage) was hidden in this guy’s body.</p><p>So, after he lost the restriction of his cultivation level, he was able to unleash such a spiritual technique that could threaten the higher void (level)?</p><p>“Really, are you crazy?”Yi silently ridiculed.</p><p>At this moment, he didn’t even dare to use his spiritual senses to touch the dragon melting realm that had burned his bounded domain.</p><p>Because it wasn’t just a bounded domain.</p><p>Spiritual senses, path energy.</p><p>Even the power and spiritual source that he could control in his body..</p><p>It was so exaggerated that his entire sea of Qi had been ignited by Xu Xiaoshou’s glance!</p><p>“Cloud and rain elimination, form!”</p><p>The power of the higher void formed a seal with his hands and destroyed all the calamity power in his body, including the white flame.</p><p>Then, he jumped up and tried to fight against this person who was getting more and more powerful.</p><p>He couldn’t let him go down anymore.</p><p>Otherwise, he really didn’t know what other moves he would use.</p><p>However, when he raised his head, he saw that the person who was showing off just now..</p><p>Had disappeared?</p><p>“Look, I’m Here!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s voice came from behind him after he canceled the vanishing technique.</p><p>He turned around at the speed of light and continued to pounce forward.</p><p>That was because the person behind him was definitely taking advantage of his unprepared state to prepare for a strike.</p><p>“Take the easy way out!”</p><p>A punch was a given.</p><p>However, at this moment, Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have already expected what Yi was thinking. There was clearly a distance of a few bodies between them. He took a step into the sky, and when his figure appeared again.</p><p>His fist had already touched Yi’s old Zhang Face.</p><p>No!</p><p>This was not Yi’s face.</p><p>This was the old Zhang Face in Xu Xiaoshou’s heart, the one who had fed him the seeds at Goose Lake, tormented him, and vowed to make him pay for everything.</p><p>“Passive Fist, Break!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
