Perhaps he’s someone like him but not him at all? Is he Xu Xiaoshou’s… younger brother?” Zhou Tianshen could not help but doubt himself.</p><p>Then, his thoughts were led into something like, “Yeah, I don’t think I’ve ever heard Xu Xiaoshou talk about his family either”.</p><p>…</p><p>Hua Ying, who was anxiously waiting at the back, got some clues from Zhou Tianshen’s repeated rejections.</p><p>She suddenly realized that perhaps Zhou Tianshen had made a wrong deduction.</p><p>If they were old friends, it was inevitable that Zhou Tianshen wouldn’t be able to recognize the real person at this moment, but it was unforgivable!</p><p>Moreover, to assume that it was the same Young Master Xu at the First Pavilion in the Sky, that was just Zhou Tianshen’s wishful speculation.</p><p>There was a high probability that the person in front wasn’t Young Master Xu.</p><p>When she thought of this, Hua Ying straightened her back which was slightly bent.</p><p>Her fearful and respectful eyes gradually became alerted. What followed was a shocking and angry emotion!</p><p>“How could a faker try to trick me to get the Bodhi Root?” Hua Ying clenched her fingers tightly, and her faintly contained eyes were burning with raging flames.</p><p>The atmosphere in the private room suddenly became extremely cold.</p><p>Liu Lu who was still covering his mouth while watching the scene suddenly trembled with his heart going extremely cold.</p><p>He looked at Hua Ying in a panic. He wondered why did this beast-masked woman suddenly had an outburst of emotions?</p><p>“Wait…”</p><p>Zhou Tianshen also realized that the situation was turning sour. Hua Ying was clearly about to explode.</p><p>He quickly blocked Hua Ying with his arm and said, “I can still try asking…”</p><p>“Move away!”</p><p>Hua Ying grabbed Zhou Tianshen’s arm with her fingers and pulled him back.</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>At that moment, Zhou Tianshen could obviously feel that he lost the feeling of being on solid ground under his feet.</p><p>He was an eight-foot-tall strong man!</p><p>He was actually carried away by this delicate-looking woman on the spot!</p><p>Moreover, he couldn’t even help but almost hit the door!</p><p>“Where did this monster come from…” Zhou Tianshen who managed to stabilize his steps eventually was completely stunned.</p><p>He knew Hua Ying did not use any spiritual source at all. It was purely her physical strength.</p><p>The last time he encountered such a terrifying physical strength, it was Xu Xiaoshou..</p><p>Hua Ying threw Zhou Tianshen behind and took a step forward. She looked directly at the mysterious Young Master Xu under the beast mask and asked, “Who… Who are you?”</p><p>“You don’t know who I am?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. He glanced at the three people in front of him and said, “You should have investigated everything about me through the Night Cat before coming here.”</p><p>“I’m talking about who are you in exact? I don’t want such an ambiguous answer!” Hua Ying was extremely angry and panted heavily.</p><p>She was not stupid. She had long seen that Young Master Xu had been playing around and avoiding the main point.</p><p>However, when Xu Xiaoshou heard this, he was delighted.</p><p>He spread his hands.</p><p>“So I did not meet your expectations?”</p><p>“But I am who I am. It can’t be fake… Besides, the Night Cat won’t let a fake Young Master Xu into the trade fair, right?”</p><p>“Hey, what are you thinking about?”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou spoke, he bent over and leaned closer to the beast-masked woman. “I am Xu Deye!”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>Hua Ying felt like digging out those annoying eyes from behind the beast mask!</p><p>However, she hesitated in her heart.</p><p>She had released the infernal power. If he was from the Infernal lineage too, he would definitely be able to sense it.</p><p>Under such circumstances, he shouldn’t be treating her this way.</p><p>Most importantly, from the moment she entered the room until now, Hua Ying had been paying attention to Young Master Xu’s power all the time.</p><p>She tried to use her spiritual senses to detect the infernal power in Young Master Xu’s energy reserve.</p><p>That way, even if Zhou Tianshen did not ask, the answer would be obvious.</p><p>But…</p><p>To no avail!</p><p>Not to mention the infernal power, Hua Ying could not even tell Young Master Xu’s cultivation level.</p><p>At this moment, there were only two possible answers.</p><p>Perhaps this person was Young Master Xu, but his cultivation level was terrifyingly strong, and he could hide it perfectly.</p><p>Or, this person was a pure faker!</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>“Conjecture, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>“Glared at, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou remained unmoved as he looked at the beast-masked woman in front of him. She was trying her best to suppress her anger while thinking hard despite standing so close to him.</p><p>He wondered what was she angry about?</p><p>Could it be that she had an “angry physique”?</p><p>Infernal power… Xu Xiaoshou sensed that for sure. When she used her energy reserve, he immediately noticed it.</p><p>But so what?</p><p>To be honest, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t believe that Elder Sang would have other disciples, children or grandchildren.</p><p>Even Elder Sang was imprisoned in the Holy Divine Palace, even though the person in front of him had indeed displayed infernal power.</p><p>Her identity was still questionable.</p><p>After all, there was only one person whom Elder Sang advised him to rely on in the end.</p><p>“Your next patron is the Holy Palace, Long Rongzhi (Molten Dragon) !”</p><p>Could this girl be Long Rongzhi (Molten Dragon) ?</p><p>No.</p><p>Long Rongzhi was a man, an old bald man. He was Elder Sang’s master, Demi-Saint Infernal. He couldn’t be this stupid girl with an angry physique.</p><p>As for the others…</p><p>If Elder Sang did not say anything, he would not believe anyone even if he was given the Infernal Original Seed.</p><p>Who knew if this was a spy sent by the Holy Divine Palace?</p><p>Perhaps, other than the Holy Palace’s Long Rongzhi (Molten Dragon), the Infernal lineage had already been infiltrated and corrupted by other factions?</p><p>“Little girl, what’s your name?”</p><p>Ignoring the beast-masked woman’s anger, Xu Xiaoshou calmly asked, “Speaking of which, you gave me a treasure, but I didn’t know your name and haven’t expressed my gratitude. I’ve been really rude.”</p><p>“Hua Ying!” Hua Ying enunciated each word and gritted her teeth.</p><p>“Oh, Miss Hua…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paused for a while before continuing. He said with the corner of his mouth twitching, “Hua, Hua… Miss Hua Ying.”</p><p>He took a gentle breath, calming himself down from the urge to laugh.</p><p>If he were to laugh at this moment, the arena would inevitably be filled with an earth-shattering battle.</p><p>He cupped his fists and continued, “In that case, I would like to thank Miss Hua Ying for giving me the treasure. If there’s nothing else…”</p><p>He pointed his hand in the direction of the door, and tilted his head. “The three of you, would you leave?”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>“Ambushed, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>Swish.</p><p>Hua Ying moved in a split second. Her delicate hand was like a dragon’s shadow, reaching toward Xu Xiaoshou’s chest.</p><p>Who was Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>He was a master with Agility!</p><p>Almost at the moment when Hua Ying’s muscles tensed up, he leaned back. Hua Ying’s fist only left a trace of air across his chest.</p><p>“You want to touch me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sneered.</p><p>How could he give her the chance to touch his body and check out his infernal power?</p><p>“Ha!”</p><p>Hua Ying was enraged by the sound. Her attack instantly fell onto Young Master Xu right hand in the air.</p><p>At that critical moment, Xu Xiaoshou was calm and composed. He said in his heart, “Close-bounds Force Field.”</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>The sky was filled with blood.</p><p>When Hua Ying’s hand was just inches away from Xu Xiaoshou, it was as if she had been sucked into a crushing machine. Her hand turned into a bloody mess.</p><p>“What…”</p><p>At that moment, Hua Ying was stunned.</p><p>The intense pain made her withdraw her hand at the speed of light. She was dumbfounded.</p><p>Master physique, master cultivation level…</p><p>Even if her power of sacred physique had yet to be unraveled, how could one possibly use such an obscure spiritual technique to break through her defense!</p><p>What kind of move was it?</p><p>“Surprised, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>After two moves, Hua Ying received a counterattack.</p><p>This time, she retracted her hand. They instantly separated far apart. It was impossible for them to come into contact again.</p><p>On the other side, Xin Gugu had just rushed over when the battle ended.</p><p>He never expected the beast-masked woman to make a move. At this moment, she was like a triggered tiger. Her eyes were red and exploding with bloody veins.</p><p>How could she attempt to challenge the dignity of the First Pavilion in the Sky?</p><p>Did she plan to come and go as she liked?</p><p>How could it be?</p><p>“Impudent! ! !”</p><p>With an explosive shout, in an instant, a surging aura of the Sovereign swept the entire scene.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The window sill of the private room, including the barrier, instantly exploded.</p><p>The shattered glass pieces and the bright barrier fragments instantly splashed and flooded the trade fair like spilled water.</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>“What’s going on? Are they fighting?”</p><p>“Isn’t this Room 172?”</p><p>“Heavens! It’s The Magic Pill Technicians Association! Are they fighting with Room 172? Aren’t they going to give away treasures?”</p><p>The flow of the trade fair was once again disrupted.</p><p>Before this, no one would have thought that anybody would dare to fight at the trade fair.</p><p>This was completely disregarding the Night Cat!</p><p>…</p><p>“Let’s go take a look.”</p><p>The black-robed beast-masked man, Nangong Yin, who had already returned from the platform to oversee the scene, immediately waved his hand when he heard the sound. In an instant, more than ten beast-masked men rushed from all sides to investigate the scene.</p><p>The battle scene, Room 172.</p><p>Liu Lu’s entire body collapsed to the ground. He was so scared that he almost peed.</p><p>A moment ago, he was still laughing at Zhou Tianshen’s funny question and his defeated expression. In the next second, the beast-masked woman who carried an alchemy cauldron made an attack.</p><p>“What happened in the blink of an eye?”</p><p>Liu Lu was trembling under the aura of the Sovereign.</p><p>When he looked up again, the scenery in the room had completely changed.</p><p>As far as the eye could see…</p><p>The violent beast-masked Sovereign, Xin Gugu stood out and single-handedly held the front line.</p><p>Mu Zixi followed closely behind. She pressed her palms together, and the thick dark green vines in the room were intertwined. Poisonous flowers and plants swayed in the air, turning the scene into a forest.</p><p>On the other hand, the beast-masked woman from the First Pavilion in the Sky, who had been silent the whole time, stood up from the sofa to be in front of Young Master Xu.</p><p>As for Young Master Xu…</p><p>Young Master Xu, who was leaning against the broken windowsill, was calm and composed. His sleeves hung behind his waist, hiding his wrists underneath.</p><p>He raised his beast mask slightly and looked in front with disdain.</p><p>Liu Lu could sense a hint of disdain and ridicule in Young Master Xu’s eyes, which were hidden under the beast mask.</p><p>His casual and carefree attitude seemed to be warning the three guests from Room 183.</p><p>“You want to fight?”</p><p>“Well, any time!”</p><p>Liu Lu’s body trembled again.</p><p>He was shocked.</p><p>This scene perfectly described the term “all ready”!</p><p>The other party was just testing him…</p><p>With this kind of aura, the counterattack formation of First Pavilion in the Sky was simply a prehistoric beast that was ready to devour people!</p><p>How could one try to test them out?</p><p>If he had been on the other side, he would probably be pissing in his pants right now!</p><p>In the corridor outside the private room.</p><p>Two rows of beast-masked men walked quickly past the venue of the trade fair and arrived at the door of Room 172.</p><p>In backstage, Yuan Haisheng cleared the spiritual array. The door was pushed open.</p><p>Following closely behind, Nangong Yin strode in. He swept his gaze across the scene and looked at Liu Lu, one of his own people.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Oh my god… Liu Lu has butterflies in his stomach the moment he saw the Second Manager.</p><p>When had he ever faced such a scene?</p><p>He grew up from the streets of the Imperial City. It was because of Young Master Xu that he was able to enter the inner circle of the Night Cat. Now, he was only in charge of communicating with Young Master Xu.</p><p>This mission was originally not bad. After all, Young Master Xu was not as difficult to talk to as the rumors said.</p><p>In fact, he was extremely generous with his money.</p><p>However, working with Young Master Xu was very thrilling day in and day out!</p><p>It was fine for the First Pavilion in the Sky to threaten Fourth Manager Yuan at night. But when they arrived at the spirit gem trade fair, they also created a scene and attracted Nangong Yin, the second-in-charge of Nangong City!</p><p>“Well, let’s put it this way…” Liu Lu struggled to get up and said with a trembling voice, but he could barely explain the situation.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that Liu Lu didn’t have the guts, so he waved his hand by the windowsill.</p><p>“Let me tell you!”</p><p>He pointed at the three people who were the culprits and said, “These three, the people in Room 183, wanted to covert attack me in the name of giving away treasures. Fortunately, I reacted in time, or else I would’ve been dead.”</p><p>Hearing this, Hua Ying couldn’t help but stretch her neck.</p><p>What?</p><p>All she wanted to do was to touch him and sense the infernal power, was that as serious as what he said?</p><p>“Doubted, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>On the other side, Zhou Tianshen and Su Qianqian who kept silent all this while, had their eyes lit up and their hearts affirmed with these small details that no one would pay attention to.</p><p>It was him!</p><p>It was definitely him!</p><p>Although Zhou Tianshen did not know why did Xu Xiaoshou only give the signal now, it was definitely him.</p><p>He could smell it!</p><p>“Acknowledged, Passive Points + 2.”</p><p>Beside the door of the private room, Nangong Yin furrowed his brows and turned to look at Liu Lu.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Liu Lu was on the verge of tears. His fingers were trembling as he stammered, “I can’t say that this is not the case… It’s just that…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glared at him coldly.</p><p>Liu Lu puffed his chest.</p><p>“It’s correct!”</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points + 3.”</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points + 23.”</p><p>Yuan Haisheng’s voice sounded in his ears. Nangong Yin paused for a moment before he understood what happened.</p><p>This gave him a headache.</p><p>On one side was the Demi-Saint faction that he wanted to befriend, and on the other side was the veteran Magic Pill Technicians Association. He was in dilemma!</p><p>Just as he was thinking.</p><p>Under the gaze of everyone, a lady with the beast mask removed walked out of Room 183.</p><p>Behind her were several elders who were also wearing the elixir masters’ long robes.</p><p>The Magic Pill Technicians Association was extremely famous for protecting their own.</p><p>Furthermore, one of them in this scene was an envoy from the Holy Palace. She was Dong Ling’s half master’s true grand-disciple in name.</p><p>Thus, Dong Ling immediately looked at Hua Ying and asked, “They made the first move?”</p><p>This was clearly a statement with an affirmative tone.</p><p>When Hua Ying heard this, she was stunned for a moment and didn’t know how to answer.</p><p>Even her master Bai Lian had never protected her like this!</p><p>Hua Ying wanted to say “No”, but she felt that she couldn’t say so in such a condition.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou who was sitting opposite was amused out of anger.</p><p>Where did this arrogant person come from? How could she distort the truth even more than me?</p><p>He took a step forward and looked past Nangong Yin. Across the long corridor, his loud and clear questioning voice resounded throughout the entire hall.</p><p>“Old aunt, don’t you think that you’re being a little unreasonable?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
