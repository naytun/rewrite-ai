Dual Sovereign Sect, Xu Xiaoshou!</h1><p>Chapter 769: Passive Skill Upgrade! Dual Sovereign Sect, Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p><strong>Translator:</strong> Nyoi-Bo Studio <strong>Editor:</strong> Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Xiaolian left.</p><p>She took away the 100,000 portions of Amber Juice that Young Master Xu had given her, leaving behind a very vexing message.</p><p>“There’s a conducting alchemy trial, what’s the point of suppressing one’s cultivation level…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried to get his senses back.</p><p>He thought hard for a long time before he finally understood the meaning of suppressing one’s cultivation level.</p><p>Master (stage) as early as possible and a breakthrough master (stage) completed as the Imperial City trial started, were two completely different concepts.</p><p>At the very least, based on his current progress, he could use the information gap to perfectly separate young master Xu, Xu Deye, and saint servant Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>This information gap wasn’t even the most obvious right now.</p><p>This was because the saint servant, Xu Xiaoshou, had displayed his abilities to the world.</p><p>However, Young Master Xu had only displayed a tiny bit of his strength during the heaven geomantic battle. The arena was filled with countless people, and it was filled with countless people.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou had broken through to become a master, and his most obvious Passive Skill had yet to completely level up.</p><p>To outsiders, it was possible that master (stage) , who was at the peak of the Innate (stage) , was only slightly different in terms of ‘Divine Enlightment’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not.</p><p>The difference between his Innate and Master (stage) was like the difference between the clouds and the mud!</p><p>“Then, it’s time to increase this gap infinitely…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered and entered Yuan mansion in a flash.</p><p>Before he entered.</p><p>He had combined all of his combat strength. Ignoring Aje, the Saint Blood, and the external power of Saint Blood, he might only be able to hold the Sovereign (stage) and barely kill it.</p><p>After he came out, he believed in the sovereign (stage) , unless he reached the final-stage of the Dao realm.</p><p>Otherwise…</p><p>It wouldn’t be a problem!</p><p>…</p><p>The Yuan Mansion World was brimming with vitality.</p><p>Greedy the White Cat Spirit had gained a round of weight. It wandered around in the thirty thousand alchemy cauldron, enjoying the blessings of 007.</p><p>Xu Xiaoji was conscientious and conscientious. Box after box of Amber Juice refined by Greedy the Cat Spirit were calculated and placed in its proper position.</p><p>Perhaps it was because the work was too simple, or perhaps he was too bored.</p><p>Xu Xiaoji’s piles of boxes of Amber Juice was particularly neat and organized. The edges and corners were distinct, and there was not the slightest bit of distortion. It was as if the instructor was carrying out the most rigorous training on the boxes of Amber Juice.</p><p>As soon as Xu Xiaoji entered the Yuan Mansion world, he could still see Xu Xiaoji strolling leisurely among the thirty thousand alchemy cauldrons after he had finished stacking the mountain of spiritual ingredients.</p><p>Slowly..</p><p>Comparing..</p><p>He shifted the position of the bottles of alchemy cauldron.</p><p>At this moment, more than half of the thirty thousands alchemy cauldron had been arranged into neat rows, which looked pleasing to the eye.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit slipped away quickly and accidentally knocked one of the bottles in the army formation. Xu Xiaoji would even frown and scold, “Be careful! You’re so rash, how can you call this a ghost beast? Do you know anything about the aesthetics of symmetry? Silly cat…”</p><p>This last sentence was said with a suppressed voice.</p><p>Obviously, the two of them had interacted in the Yuan Mansion world during this period of time and had developed an extremely harmonious way of communication.</p><p>Xu Xiaoji scolded him, Greedy the Cat Spirit slipped away..</p><p>Xu Xiaoji moved the alchemy cauldron again, Greedy the Cat Spirit knocked it again..</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had entered the Yuan Mansion world, was speechless for a moment.</p><p>He had never thought that the Yuan Mansion was such a good place. How could it be that Xu Xiaoji had even developed obsessive-compulsive disorder?</p><p>“Is it that boring…”Xu Xiaoshou was doubtful.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoji, who was in the alchemy cauldron array, clearly sensed that someone had come from the Yuan Mansion world. He didn’t care at first and thought that it was a prisoner. When he turned around and saw that it was the Great Demon Kng Xu, his eyes lit up.</p><p>“Lord Shou…”he stepped forward.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand, “It’s fine. You guys do what you need to do. I’ll play by myself.”</p><p>After saying that, he moved to a corner where no one was around. He drew a line in the air to separate the two sides so that Greedy the Cat Spirit would not disturb them.</p><p>Xu Xiaoji’s excited expression froze, and tears started to well up in his eyes.</p><p>“Didn’t you say that you would give me a holiday after you finished reciting the The Book of the Dao? Did you forget it in the blink of an eye?”</p><p>“Hehe, man!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Passive Points: 1,669,477.”</p><p>In the quiet place of Yuan Mansion, Xu Xiaoshou looked at the 1.6 million passive points and the corner of his mouth twitched.</p><p>Putting aside the 1 million Passive Points that the stupid system had tricked him into,.</p><p>Other than the sense of danger he had felt the last time, he had awakened a “Close-bounds Force Field”.</p><p>He had accumulated so many Passive Points for such a long time, wasn’t it so that after becoming a Master (stage) , he could directly double, double, and double his combat strength?</p><p>“Then, who will be the first lucky person to be flipped?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his hands together and began to ask for concubines. His eyes flashed with green light as he scanned through the rows of passive skills on the information bar.</p><p>Soon, his line of sight settled.</p><p>“Strengthen (Master (stage 1)”</p><p>Without a doubt, Concubine Strength had been with him the longest, and she had fought the most head-on battles.</p><p>As the strongest single-target Passive Skill, who should he use this first card to defeat..</p><p>There was no doubt about it!</p><p>Casually tossing over 100,000 Passive Points, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes rolled back, and he began to enjoy the convulsions and spasms on his body that he had not experienced for a long time.</p><p>It was a process where cells were rapidly dividing and growing, and the density of his muscles and bones were increasing at a crazy rate.</p><p>If he were to see his body with his inner vision, the state of Xu Xiaoshou’s body at this moment was as if he had been struck by a bolt of lightning. It was as if his cells had been reborn from the flames.</p><p>“Wu!”</p><p>He grunted.</p><p>The rise of the Master (stage) was not that obvious under the effects of ‘Stealth’, ‘Perception’, and other passive skills.</p><p>However, for Passive Skills like ‘Strengthen’, the Master (stage) itself was extremely powerful.</p><p>Every rise in level could be said to be another transformation.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had not leveled up for a long time. He had long forgotten the things that he had to pay attention to when upgrading his Passive Skills: this thing could not be leveled up in a row. It had to be done slowly.</p><p>And now that he had leveled up consecutively from Master (stage) to Sovereign (stage) , it was truly unbearable.</p><p>“Ah ah ah –”</p><p>Finally, Xu Xiaoshou could no longer suppress the pain. A shrill cry burst out from his throat.</p><p>The shrill cry shook the sky.</p><p>Yuan Mansion had always been quiet.</p><p>Xu Xiaoji knew that the Great Demon King Xu would definitely not come in with good news.</p><p>But when he heard this pig-killing alike scream, Xu Xiaoji was also dumbfounded.</p><p>The Great Demon King Xu came in this time, and instead of torturing others, he tormented himself?</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit also stopped.</p><p>Yuan Mansion was very fragrant and full of the vitality of the Spirit Mark of Life and the fragrance of Elixirs.</p><p>However, at this moment, a foul stench came from Xu Xiaoshou’s seclusion..</p><p>“What is he doing?”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng and Greedy the Cat Spirit looked over at the same time. They were extremely curious, but at the same time, they were also extremely shocked, “Is Yuan Mansion taking a shit? !”</p><p>…</p><p>The screams continued for about half an hour.</p><p>“Zi ~”</p><p>Then, the black, stinky impurities almost spurted out from his pores, instantly dyeing Xu Xiaoshou’s clothes black.</p><p>“! ! !”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had regained his consciousness, was shocked.</p><p>He had thought that his master physique was already invincible, but after enduring the pain of leveling up, he realized that there were still impurities in his body!</p><p>Moreover, how could a mere level 10 Master (stage) to Sovereign (stage) produce so many s… impurities?</p><p>“Bullsh*t !”</p><p>Sighing deeply, Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath, and his face turned green. He almost “Yue”out.</p><p>He hurriedly took off his clothes.</p><p>Thinking that it was unlikely that he would wear this thing in the future, he immediately cremated it.</p><p>Then, his body shook, and the black impurities and solidified matter on the surface of his body broke apart. Xu Xiaoshou immediately burned these things with a white flame.</p><p>He felt that he was not clean anymore, so he decided to use the white flame to baptize himself.</p><p>“Bathing with fire…”</p><p>This was definitely cleaner than using water.</p><p>Because not only was the dirt washed, Xu Xiaoshou almost burned his own hair.</p><p>After that, he poured a bucket of cold water from the ring, and he completely transformed his physical body.</p><p>Touching his body in surprise, Xu Xiaoshou could clearly feel that at this moment, even the world was shorter.</p><p>No!</p><p>I’m taller…</p><p>The most powerful part of his “Perception” was that he could use God’s perspective to observe a certain area, so Xu Xiaoshou could do self-observation without a mirror.</p><p>He could see that after the transformation of his physical body, not only had his height increased by a few centimeters, but the obvious sense of thinness from before had also completely disappeared.</p><p>What he could see with the naked eye was all “aesthetic” art!</p><p>The golden proportions of his body, the muscles of his arms, the well-defined abs, his slender and exquisite thighs, and his crystal clear jade-like feet..</p><p>“Bah!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou spat at the sudden deviation and gave himself a slap.</p><p>What am I doing?</p><p>I’m actually craving for my body. Have I gone nuts?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was too shocked!</p><p>Not only was his treasured body crystal clear, his skin was like Jade, and there was a faint glow of multicolored light and a faint fragrance.</p><p>His looks had also completely risen to a whole new level.</p><p>In the past, he could only be considered an ordinary handsome youth at best. Xu Xiaoshou’s attractiveness did not depend on his appearance, but on his ability and inner qualities.</p><p>But now, he felt that just this face alone could allow him to go out and fight in the world.</p><p>This face was too good at fighting!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had not seen many handsome men in the Spiritual Cultivation Realm that could astonish others, and Fu Xing could be considered one of them.</p><p>In the past, he was a little jealous of the other party… This was something that he did not want to admit in the past, but now he could admit it.</p><p>But at this moment, he felt that even if he did not need to use his face, just the majestic and holy aura brought about by the enhancement of his treasured body alone could crush all other people of the same gender!</p><p>This was an ability that only a sacred physique could have, right?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou moved his hands up and down on himself.</p><p>Then, he hesitantly took out a set of clothes and wanted to put them on. After all, it was not very good to be naked.</p><p>However, he suddenly felt that this kind of cheap clothes, which were only worth tens of thousands of Spirit Crystal, did not seem to be suitable for his body at this time.</p><p>Thus, his movements stopped..</p><p>“Strengthen (Sovereign (Stage 1)”</p><p>Sovereign Physique!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep look at the information bar again and confirmed that he had reached the maximum level and could not advance any further. Moreover, everything that happened to his body was really the effect of the Sovereign Physique. He heaved a sigh of relief and put on the clothes.</p><p>“Sorry to trouble you…”</p><p>He patted his abs and pinched his chest, comforting his body, “After you leave the Yuan Mansion, I’ll buy you a set of treasured clothes as a reward. The treasured clothes and the Sovereign Physique are a perfect match.”</p><p>The “Strengthen”effect of the sovereign (stage) level was a little too shocking.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never thought that an overt passive skill would have such a powerful effect that could be seen with the naked eye.</p><p>But on second thought.</p><p>“Sovereign Physique…”</p><p>Ordinary people said that ancient swordsman were hard to find, but perhaps it was because he was born in the Eastern Region. Xu Xiaoshou could still occasionally see stunning ancient swordsman, so he didn’t mind.</p><p>However, it seemed that Xu Xiaoshou had never seen anyone else who had a Sovereign Physique other than Elder Sang.</p><p>He had seen one or two sacred physique before.</p><p>However, the fact that someone else could possess a ‘Sovereign Physique’ was due to their bloodline, Innate (stage) , and talent.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that the difficulty of cultivating a ‘Sovereign Physique’ (stage) was comparable to how the first generation of sacred physique was born!</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou could not help but be curious:</p><p>“The difference in the grade of a ‘Sovereign Physique’ is huge. Those in the Path are called ‘Sovereign Physique’. Theoretically, those in the Cutting Path (stage) should be called ‘Noble Physique’. Finally, there’s the higher void (level) physique.”</p><p>“Will the upgrade of the Passive Skill treat it as the ‘Sovereign lv. 1 ~ 9’, or will it be classified?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was burning with passion.</p><p>If he really followed the system’s previous settings, the next time he broke through to the Sovereign (stage) , his physical body would be able to directly rise to the demi-saint level.</p><p>Demi-saint…</p><p>That was a height that was enough to beat Ai Cangsheng to a pulp!</p><p>“Calm down, calm down.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath and pressed down with both hands. He suppressed his emotions with his energy center.</p><p>But in the next second, he broke through and he covered his mouth and snickered.</p><p>Just upgrading a Sovereign Physique was already so powerful.</p><p>And this was just the beginning!</p><p>“Damn it, more than a million Passive Points. Even if I use all of them to upgrade my Passive Skills, it’s enough for me, Xu Xiaoshou, to reach the level of crushing a Sovereign (stage) !”</p><p>The benefits of accumulating Passive Points earlier had come out.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou began the second round of flip cards with a large amount of capital in his pocket.</p><p>“Sword Technique expertise!”</p><p>Without a doubt, the Sovereign Physique of the Way of the Sword and the Sovereign (stage) were the most powerful!</p><p>The Strength consort and the Sword consort were Xu Xiaoshou’s favorites.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to think about it in the past. He felt that even the world didn’t dare to think about it.</p><p>However, after “Strengthen”reached the Sovereign Physique level, it really brought about the effect of it. He felt that he really wanted to create history.</p><p>Master (stage) , Heavenly Image State, Sovereign Physique, Way of the Sword, Sovereign (stage) .</p><p>— dual Sovereign Sect!</p><p>Either suppress one’s cultivation level to death, or explode crazily.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou, whose face was flushed red from the powerful images in his mind, fiercely threw out 100,000 Passive Points. After exchanging for 10 tier 3 Skill Point in the store… he carefully gave his “Sword Technique Expertise”, he gently went up a level.</p><p>“Weng!”</p><p>As if his head had been hit by a heavy blow, a large amount of knowledge gushed in, and his head felt like it was about to split open.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou instantly entered Divine Enlightenment. He abandoned the pain and began to passively comprehend.</p><p>After a short while, the impact of the knowledge was interrupted, and Xu Xiaoshou’s Skill Point went up again.</p><p>The cycle repeated.</p><p>Ten round trips!</p><p>“Sword Technique Expertise (Master (Lv. 1)”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Sword Technique Expertise (Sovereign (Lv. 1)”</p><p>When he opened his eyes again, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes burst with a brilliant light.</p><p>The brilliant light took on an intangible form and materialized in the void. It turned into a transparent sword light and cut through the void on the spot.</p><p>“Keng –”</p><p>The Yuan Mansion world shook violently. Cracks appeared in the void and turned into a small sword of nothingness.</p><p>Xu Xiaoji was frightened again.</p><p>He raised his eyes in surprise. From the corner of his eyes, he could clearly see Greedy the Cat Spirit’s shocked eyes. There was a human-like astonishment in his eyes.</p><p>“Again?”</p><p>The abnormal phenomenon this time was much more exaggerated than the screaming last time.</p><p>It was the first time that the Heaven and Earth phenomenon was born in Yuan Mansion!</p><p>The Path Pattern Initial Stone seemed to be recording something, but it also seemed to be perfecting something. The Heaven and Earth Path Energy was full of vigor.</p><p>The Space Order seemed to have sensed something, and it began to evolve and deduce something. The path appeared.</p><p>Whoosh.</p><p>All Swords to the Master of Heaven and Earth were completed, and they transformed into a strange scene from all directions.</p><p>In the desolate and savage land of the Yuan Mansion, the Supreme Sovereign the one Sword King was established.</p><p>The space barrier was broken, and a magnificent young man with black hair that looked down on everyone appeared in mid-air.</p><p>For a moment, Xu Xiaoji was stunned.</p><p>That figure truly explained what it meant to have sword-like eyebrows and starry eyes, as well as bright teeth.</p><p>His eyes were slightly contained, and there was no God or Buddha in them. He was aloof and proud, as if he was a king in the sky.</p><p>His body had the Path Energy and treasure clouds, flowing with brilliant colors.</p><p>His Qi was like walking under the saint, free from dust.</p><p>His quality was like a sword hidden in a deep box, waiting to soar into the sky.</p><p>Xu Xiaoji was completely stunned. For a moment, he even thought that person was the Great Demon King Xu, until he realized that there was only one human in Yuan Mansion, and that person was called the Great Demon King Xu..</p><p>He tentatively opened his mouth to ask, “Shou, Lord Shou?”</p><p>After asking, he felt ashamed. He felt that it was too blasphemous for a mortal like him to use such vulgar language to ask.</p><p>“Revered, Passive Points + 2.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou froze in mid-air for a long time.</p><p>He glanced sideways, wanting to say a very high-class “What’s the matter”.</p><p>But on second thought, pretending for Xu Xiaoji was useless.</p><p>Thus, he flew down. He could not suppress the joy in his heart at all and said with a beaming expression, “Xu Xiaoji, have I become more handsome?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoji: ? ? ? ?</p><p>Shut Up!</p><p>Can you not speak!</p><p>You’re simply tarnishing your f*cking image!</p><p>“Hated, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>“Acknowledged, Passive Points + 1.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
