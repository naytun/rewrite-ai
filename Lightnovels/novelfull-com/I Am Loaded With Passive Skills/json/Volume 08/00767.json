In fact, you haven’t even heard it that many times during your growth?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked up in shock.</p><p>Did this old woodcutter master the mind reading technique?</p><p>“I don’t have the mind reading technique, but I know some Divine Secret. After being blocked by the Way of the Heavens, people don’t even have the chance to think about it,”Cen Qiaofu said calmly.</p><p>“Stupid people?”Xu Xiaoshou looked up.</p><p>“It’s not that I can’t understand it like that…”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu hesitated for a while and didn’t refute. He returned to the previous topic, “So use your smart little brain to think about what the Chief wants you to do, or what you want to pursue.”</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou did not think about anything. He blurted out two words.</p><p>“Freedom, protection!”</p><p>This was the meaning of life that he had finally found in the difficulties of the mortal world.</p><p>But at this moment, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt that he needed to add another one.</p><p>“… and the ‘truth’!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu was slightly moved. He did not refute or ridicule. After a pause, he said with emotion, “Well said. Do you know my story?”</p><p>“Hmm, why?”Xu Xiaoshou nodded and said in surprise, “The woodcutter of the southern region became a Cutting Path (stage) overnight. Who in this world doesn’t know?”</p><p>He had always been skeptical about the story of “Cutting Path (stage) overnight,”but he did not know the difficulty of it.</p><p>But now, along the way, he had clashed with many Sovereign (stage) and Cutting Path (stage) .</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that if this story came true…</p><p>Cen Qiaofu, perhaps he should be the protagonist the Way of the Heavens?</p><p>He was definitely using the template of protagonist to grow!</p><p>“So, the legend of your ‘Cutting Path (stage) overnight’ has also been spread around like a legend, or… is it true?”Xu Xiaoshou probed.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu smiled indifferently.</p><p>“It’s not a legend, this is the truth.”</p><p>“When I was still in the mountains, I actually longed for the world beyond the mountains. After becoming a ‘Cutting Path'(stage) , I longed for the world beyond the heavens.”</p><p>“I wonder if the Chief has told you the so-called… answer?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>He naturally knew the “answer”that Bazhun’an had given him.</p><p>And in the path that Bazhun’an had planned for him, after walking through the Imperial City trial, the Holy Palace trial, and entering the Continent’s Saint training base…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou still remembered the night after the battle in the Eighth Palace. Bazhun’an was lying on a mountain rock and talking to him about the full moon,</p><p>“Over there, perhaps you can find the answer you want.”</p><p>It was also at this time that his memory was pulled back to reality. Cen Qiaofu, who was opposite him, actually blurted out a similar sentence, “When you go to the Four Symbols Secret Realm, you will probably find a part of the answer you want.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>He even suspected that Cen Qiaofu had been brainwashed.</p><p>Or rather, the other party was two partners and wanted to brainwash him.</p><p>“Did Bazhun’an teach you these words?”Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but be curious.</p><p>“What do you mean?”Cen Qiaofu turned his head, somewhat puzzled, but soon came to a realization, “It seems that the Chief did say something similar to you. Is it hard to believe?”</p><p>“It’s not that hard…”Xu Xiaoshou knew what he was going to say, so he stopped him in advance.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu choked again.</p><p>He rolled his eyes and took a deep breath. As if he didn’t hear it, he started to talk to himself,</p><p>“It was hard for me to believe it at that time, but after I walked out step by step and saw too much, I gradually turned numb.”</p><p>“Not only me, but the storyteller, Haitang’er, your master, and those people you haven’t met…”</p><p>“Shenyi, Wen Ting, Cao Yihan, You Tu, Kong Yuhen, Feng Tingchen, and others are all looking for this answer!”</p><p>“You should have seen many organizations that exist below the Holy Divine Palace by now. Saint Servant, Xu Yue Grey Palace, Yama, and others alike, including those true supreme factions on the Continent that you haven’t come into contact with yet…”</p><p>“Fringe Moon Immortal City, Buddhist Sect of the Western Region, Northern Sky Alliance, and others are also looking for this answer!”</p><p>“Everyone’s way of looking for the answer is different so as the process. But in the end, the essence is basically the same.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked by what he heard.</p><p>In old woodcutter’s words, he had heard too many senior’s names.</p><p>Those were all famous figures. Basically, everyone had their own legends.</p><p>In fact, Xu Xiaoshou had only heard of one name, and some he had not even heard their names.</p><p>But there were no exceptions.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s examples were all people who could stand on equal footing with Bazhun’an at their peak.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu held a teacup to moisten his throat and continued,</p><p>“And the answers they found were indeed not all found in the Holy Palace</p><p>“But still, excluding the results, everyone found an answer that they could fight for their whole life in the process</p><p>“Then, some disappeared, and some lived in remote areas..</p><p>“Some people found the answer and didn’t dare to look further</p><p>“Some people suddenly understood something halfway and stopped their journey ahead of time</p><p>“There are also some people who, after thinking about this answer, forcefully stopped themselves from thinking further and chose to live a peaceful life</p><p>“But there are also many people like me who are not afraid of death and choose to resist, Haha…”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu laughed loudly as he spoke.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was in a trance as he listened.</p><p>He felt more and more terrified to what Elder Sang referred as “Qiu Long Words”</p><p>This was simply a layer of fog that could not be removed from the world!</p><p>Someone indirectly mentioned it.</p><p>No one dared to directly confront it.</p><p>Even Bazhun’an had used decades of silence after the legend of “Three breaths for innate stage, three years for Sword Deity”.</p><p>He had only chosen to return when everyone thought he was dead.</p><p>Was there really such a powerful shadow behind the answer?</p><p>Was this shadow so terrifying that even a genius like Bazhun’an had to wait for decades before he had the courage to face it?</p><p>“What is my answer?”Xu Xiaoshou asked after hesitating for a long time. In fact, he vaguely understood what the old woodcutter wanted to say.</p><p>As expected, Cen Qiaofu waved his hand and chuckled:</p><p>“Find it yourself!”</p><p>“I can give you an instruction. The Imperial City trial is for the Abyss Island, and the Four Symbols Secret Realm is for everything you want.”</p><p>“As for the rest, you can find the truth yourself, because that is already beyond the reach of my level!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s head hurt when he heard this.</p><p>He had understood this logic for a long time.</p><p>Even the higher void (level) would not be able to give such an answer directly.</p><p>Only Bazhun’an and the others could give Xu Xiaoshou a clearer outline of the answer in such a vague situation.</p><p>Ordinary people, ordinary people of the higher void (level), were even afraid to avoid it.</p><p>— the Divine Secret must not be revealed!</p><p>“You succeeded in talking me out.”After a long time, Xu Xiaoshou sighed with emotion.</p><p>Indeed, he felt that the final goal was not very important, but the journey ahead was actually quite long and more important.</p><p>“Holy Palace…”</p><p>“Four Symbols Secret Realm…”</p><p>“Abyss Island…”</p><p>From afar to near, Xu Xiaoshou thought of the remaining problem that was extremely difficult to solve.</p><p>“So, now that I’ve broken through to the Master(stage), if I still have to participate in the Imperial City trial, wouldn’t that be the same as what you said, old woodcutter, to carry a banner across the enemy’s army and seek your own death?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu glared at him and scolded, “That depends on your own ability. Isn’t that your strongest trick?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou:”…”</p><p>How could I be such a person?</p><p>Cen Qiaofu stared at Xu Xiaoshou and sized him up, he clicked his tongue in wonder, “But how did you do it? You broke through to the Master (level). but in the eyes of the higher void, you are only at the Innate (stage) . Not even the Chief is comparable to your ability to deceive the world.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou puffed out his chest and flicked his sleeves, “It’s just a small trick. It’s not worth mentioning.”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu immediately curled his lips.</p><p>“Belittled, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>After these words, Cen Qiaofu felt that he had completely understood. Xu Xiaoshou could completely understand.</p><p>At this moment, his spiritual senses were looking at the sky outside the building. His gaze was looking towards the north as he said slowly,</p><p>“It’s getting late. I still have my own matters to attend to. This time, the Chief has summoned me. In fact, he has brought a few instructions.”</p><p>“One, participate in the Imperial City trial; two, get into the top three and head to the Four Symbols Secret Realm.”</p><p>“You can see for yourself what will happen in between. Whether you want to participate or not is entirely up to you.”</p><p>“But as long as you complete these two steps, he said that you will understand everything on your own.”</p><p>After a pause, Cen Qiaofu put down his teacup, his fingers tapped on the table. “These instructions on the surface are a bit like orders. Originally, I didn’t want to say them and only wanted you to understand. However, it doesn’t really matter whether you say it or not. I believe that you will understand. After all, you are not stupid.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless again.</p><p>Why didn’t you say it!</p><p>You’ve already said all these good and bad things, just in case someone retaliated and said that you didn’t give any explicit instructions, right?</p><p>Shrewd!</p><p>How could I, Xu Xiaoshou, be the kind of person who would backstab you?</p><p>After delivering the instructions, Cen Qiaofu didn’t want to care about Xu Xiaoshou’s reaction anymore. He stood up and was about to walk out.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou followed suit and asked, “So how are the rest of the people in the Yunlun Mountain Range?”</p><p>“Don’t worry, everything is going according to the plan.”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu turned around and said, “This time, the Holy Divine Palace has suffered the biggest loss. Not only was it a thankless task, but they didn’t even manage to catch a few ghost beasts. Rao Yaoyao is in a worse situation than Gou Wuyue.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was silent.</p><p>He thought of the Holy Divine Palace’s operation this time. Rao Yaoyao led the team, but she was really tormented by him and Bazhun’an, causing them to run back and forth without any gains.</p><p>Who would bear the wrath of the Sword Deity next?</p><p>At that time, Gou Wuyue should have at least caught a second-in-command Saint Servant, right?</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Seeing that Xu Xiaoshou was deep in thought, Cen Qiaofu had no intention of asking any more questions. He immediately waved his hand and disappeared.</p><p>The First Pavilion in the Sky was the faction of Young Master Xu. As a Saint Servant, if he stayed for too long, he was afraid that something might happen.</p><p>After all, he hadn’t even wiped clean the butt of the demi-saint’s descendant faction!</p><p>“It’s over…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou watched as the old woodcutter left after saying his piece, and he couldn’t help but fall into his previous state of contemplation.</p><p>Without a doubt, the saint servant had another big move to make during the imperial city trial, or perhaps after.</p><p>Abyss Island!</p><p>This thing had been summoned. Although Rao Yaoyao could delay her descent, she had landed in the Yunlun Mountain Range, so she couldn’t escape.</p><p>Perhaps there would be another helping force that would appear during the mid-stage of the Imperial City trial, and Abyss Island would land ahead of time.</p><p>This would be a headache for the headquarters of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>However, few outsiders knew the inside story of the Abyss Island.</p><p>On the contrary, the title of Sky City, which had the legend of the foundational roots of Saint Ascension, was more widely known.</p><p>Therefore, the rumors of the foundational roots of Saint Ascension, which had been floating in the sky above Dongtianwang City for months, would be confirmed.</p><p>At that time.</p><p>The ones who really wanted to get their hands on the “foundational roots of Saint Ascension”would be the people closest to the demi-saint, the people at the higher void (level) .</p><p>Among these people, the leaders of the major factions and the Ghost Beast host body were the majority.</p><p>This was because most of the people who could walk the formal path to the Holy Palace had received the education of the Holy Palace, so they should be the “righteous”people.</p><p>Those who could not walk the formal path to becoming a saint needed to use the opportunity provided by the Abyss Island to perfect their path to the final-stage of the saint path.</p><p>So, how would the Holy Divine Palace continue to lay out their plans, stop them, and intercept them?</p><p>In other words, there was no need to stop them, stop them..</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou thought about this, he raised his head and used his perception to probe the Abyss Island, which was slowly pulling him out of the spatial fragment bit by bit. He felt that this scene was very terrifying.</p><p>It was as if the Abyss Island was waving happily at the bosses of the dark faction that had been hidden in the Continent for a long time. They said,</p><p>“Come quickly, sir. Come quickly. There’s going to be something good falling from the sky above Dongtianwang City. As long as you can withstand the Holy Divine Palace’s defense and attack, all of you will be able to become a saint.”</p><p>It was a preposterous “conspiracy”!</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou knew that Bazhun’an was behind this.</p><p>Initially, the Holy Divine Palace did not want to expose Abyss Island to the public.</p><p>So, was everything really a coincidence?</p><p>The Saint Servant and the other dark forces were happy, but the Holy Divine Palace and the faction of justice did not seem to be particularly sad because Abyss Island was summoned.</p><p>From a different perspective, they only needed to prepare everything and wait to box it in. was that enough?</p><p>“Eh!”</p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Xiaoshou shivered.</p><p>He felt that he had better walk the line of the Imperial City trial!</p><p>Although after the night battle in the Imperial City, the Imperial City trial was still like a storm that was about to come, and there were signs that the battle situation was going to be escalated.</p><p>But these were all things that the big shots who truly needed the foundational roots of Saint Ascension’ to consider.</p><p>He was only a Master… No, Innate stage. He only needed to walk the path of the younger generation.</p><p>“Imperial City trial!”</p><p>Thinking of the Imperial City trial, Xu Xiaoshou thought of the trial quota again.</p><p>His true cultivation level was now a Master. If he wanted to pretend to be an Innate stage to enter the Imperial City trial, the first thing he had to pass was the Holy Divine Palace’s investigation stage.</p><p>Stealth, could he withstand it?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little worried, but he soon felt relieved.</p><p>It was just the Imperial City trial, there was no need to provoke a demi-saint. This was illogical..</p><p>At this moment, while he was thinking, there was a knock on the door.</p><p>“Enter.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou temporarily suppressed his thoughts of returning to his room to quickly upgrade his Passive Skills. He looked up.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng pushed the door open with two large dark circles under his eyes. His entire body was visibly weak.</p><p>He was just an ordinary person.</p><p>However, ever since he entered the First Pavilion in the Sky, it was as if he had been squeezed dry by a demon.</p><p>It was clearly just a job of serving tea and pouring water, but the heaven geomantic battle and the night battle in the Imperial City could not do without him, an ordinary person.</p><p>Following Young Master Xu around to cause trouble, Xiao Wanfeng’s work and rest schedule were turned into a chaos. Now, he gave people the feeling that he might die in the next second.</p><p>“Young master Xu, Miss Xiaolian from Plenty Gold Company requests to see you.”At the door, Xiao Wanfeng forced himself to perk up.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at this youth and hesitated for a long time before saying hesitantly,</p><p>“Do you want to go rest first? Or I will give you a raise, or…. why don’t you try cultivating again? Work hard and become a spiritual cultivator who doesn’t need to sleep?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
