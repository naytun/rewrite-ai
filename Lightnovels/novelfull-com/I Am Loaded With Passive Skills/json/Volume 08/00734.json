At most, it would make people fearful.</p><p>But for those at the Cutting Path Stage and above…</p><p>They were not only fighting against their enemies and themselves.</p><p>At the same time, they were also fighting against the Way of the Heavens!</p><p>All sorts of supreme treasure, all sorts of abilities…</p><p>The stronger one was, the more mysterious the power he controlled.</p><p>If one was foolish, he wouldn’t even know how he would die!</p><p>“To live toward death…”</p><p>“To avoid the Way of the Heavens’ energy movement…”</p><p>“To steal the heavens and change the sun…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>He finally understood why the Lei family was destroyed.</p><p>It was a family that had the Flower Fairy Eyes, Cross-shaped Eyes, Three Loathsome Eyes, Eyes of the Great Path, God Devil Eyes, and so on…</p><p>How could it be only a Higher Void family ?</p><p>The Lei family wanted to reduce their own strength and not become a Demi-Saint.</p><p>Perhaps the Higher Void in their family could easily win over a Demi-Saint?</p><p>If they did not overturn the Holy Divine Palace’s ruling position on the continent, it would only get destroyed!</p><p>After all.</p><p>Would one keep somebody more powerful by their side as a threat?</p><p>…</p><p>The thought process did not last long.</p><p>The battle was also in the blink of an eye.</p><p>After the bloodline imprints were shattered by Yin Cao, Xu Xiaoshou was only surprised for a moment. He immediately turned his head to look at the temporarily abandoned Three Loathsome Eyes that no one touched.</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Xian had already fallen into a coma.</p><p>The Hundred Ghost Night Walk had also lost the ability to move.</p><p>Yin Cao, the only one who could dominate the current situation, was also seriously injured after shattering the bloodline imprints.</p><p>If he didn’t make a move now, when would he?</p><p>Yama’s methods were violent and the Three Loathsome Eyes was indeed unpleasant.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou still landed on the ground and came to the side of the Three Loathsome Eyes.</p><p>After that.</p><p>He partially deactivated the Vanishing Technique and grabbed an eyeball that fell onto the ground.</p><p>“Clap!”</p><p>The sticky eyeball was in his hand.</p><p>However, at the same time that Xu Xiaoshou grabbed one of the Three Loathsome Eyes, the other hand also grabbed him.</p><p>“Imprisoned, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>In the invisible state, Xu Xiaoshou looked back and shockingly saw the severely injured Yin Cao. He did not realise when did Yin Cao came beside him, staring into his eyes.</p><p>The difference was that Xu Xiaoshou could clearly see the person in front of him.</p><p>However, the place where the Yin Cao was looking at was empty.</p><p>He could feel his hand grab onto someone’s hand holding the eyeball, but Yin Cao seemed to be looking at the air.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did see the Yin Cao vaguely. It seemed like Yin Cao really met his eyes through the Vanishing Technique.</p><p>Was this the perception power of the Cutting Path…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was thumping wildly. Before he could stop, Yin Cao had already spoken, “I’ve waited for you for a long time. Finally, you can’t hold it in anymore?”</p><p>As soon as he heard that.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that the other party had always been expecting him.</p><p>It was likely that this person had already sensed Xu Xiaoshou’s presence before he entered the Heaven Prayer Forest.</p><p>Yet, Yin Cao did not show the slightest hint of knowing his existence in the previous confrontation with Jiang Xian.</p><p>This kind of temperament was simply terrifying!</p><p>“Disappear.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not hesitate at all. He was about to leave together with the Three Loathsome Eyes.</p><p>However, under the suppression of power of the Cutting Path, he only felt that his right hand was no longer a part of his body.</p><p>His Vanishing Technique also lost the ability because he touched the palm of Yin Cao.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou panicked.</p><p>The only thing he could rely on was the Vanishing Technique!</p><p>But now…</p><p>He could no longer disappear?</p><p>What did the other party do?</p><p>After all, his cultivation level was too low. Even if his Awakening Technique couldn’t withstand the suppression of power of the Cutting Path, Xu Xiaoshou felt that it was reasonable.</p><p>He didn’t dwell on this point.</p><p>Since he failed, Xu Xiaoshou decided to find an alternative on the spot.</p><p>He instantly released the Three Loathsome Eyes and directly activated the “Close-bounds Force Field”.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>At this moment, the force field cut.</p><p>Yin Cao did not seem to be able to react in time. His hand that was restraining Xu Xiaoshou was cut into pieces on the spot.</p><p>A blood mist burst out.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized that it was effective and hurriedly held the Three Loathsome Eyes again, wanting to go invisible.</p><p>But with just one move…</p><p>If it was a fight between someone at his same level, Xu Xiaoshou was confident that no one would be able to react.</p><p>But what cultivation level was Yin Cao at?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou let go of his hand, made a slash and gripped again…</p><p>The time spent was endless in the eyes of Yin Cao.</p><p>“Did you actually hurt me?”</p><p>Yin Cao only cried out in surprise. The moment Xu Xiaoshou grabbed the eyes again, his split his two fingers and stabbed down on the spot.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>In his disappearing state, Xu Xiaoshou instantly sucked in a breath of cold air.</p><p>Yin Cao’s two fingers, which were full of the power of Cutting Path, directly penetrated through his passive skills and came out from his palm, tightly gripping onto the Three Loathsome Eyes.</p><p>The moment the blood splashed out, Xu Xiaoshou felt a strong sense of helplessness in his heart.</p><p>He had the confidence to fight against the Sovereign.</p><p>However, that was when he included Aje’s combat strength.</p><p>That was the case for Sovereign. As for Cutting Path, Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have lost all his trump cards.</p><p>Yin Cao still had control over everything even though he was heavily injured.</p><p>He could even vividly know Xu Xiaoshou’s presence.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to take infinity to make a move in Yin Cao’s eyes.</p><p>It was just a breath’s time, but Yin Cao seemed to have countless ways to break it.</p><p>Yin Cao only used the most basic way of them all…</p><p>Breaking ten thousand techniques with one way.</p><p>“Illusion!”</p><p>With his two fingers piercing through Xu Xiaoshou’s palm, Yin Cao shouted loudly.</p><p>He still did not know who possessed this Vanishing Technique.</p><p>However through the blood, he could confuse Xu Xiaoshou with illusion.</p><p>At that moment, even though Yin Cao’s Flower Fairy Eyes were not as bright as before, they still shone with traces of cherry pink.</p><p>The hallucinating power that was insignificant to the Yin Cao was fatal to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Without any defensive spiritual technique, Xu Xiaoshou immediately came to an enlightenment. The connection between blood was the most solid bridge between the real and the virtual.</p><p>However, by the time he reacted, it was already too late.</p><p>As if his soul had been hit by a giant hammer, his perception showed the Sea of Flowers in the daylight, replacing the Heaven Prayer Forest under the night curtain.</p><p>With that, the fantasy realm turned into a dazzling white.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he was in the middle of the clouds, and for a moment, his mind was completely relaxed.</p><p>However, as soon as he relaxed, the Information Bar popped up.</p><p>“Hallucinated, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou instantly snapped out of his fantasy.</p><p>The scene in front of him returned to normal.</p><p>However, the first thing he noticed was the deactivation of Vanishing Technique after he relaxed, even his “Transformation” was gradually fading away.</p><p>At this moment, the wrinkles on his face began to fade away.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly stabilized his “Transformation”.</p><p>This was his last layer of protection, it was also the capital to turn defeat into victory. He could not let his guard down.</p><p>At that moment.</p><p>A withered old face wearing a straw hat appeared, with two large dark circles under his eyes. Yin Cao met Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes in surprise while grabbing his hand.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou went along with the flow. Pressing on the straw hat, he grinned and raised his eyebrows,</p><p>“Storyteller, long time no see. Can’t you recognize me anymore?”</p><p>Yin Cao’s pupils constricted.</p><p>For a moment, he could not recognize the person in front of him.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou used such an intimate tone and addressed him as a “Storyteller”.</p><p>After he finished speaking, he could vaguely see the calamity power under Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes with fiery infernal power.</p><p>Suddenly.</p><p>The name of the second-in-command of the dark faction, who had stirred up a storm in the Central Region of the continent decades ago, appeared in his mind.</p><p>At the same time, the face of that person completely matched the face in front of him under the Flower Fairy Eyes.</p><p>“Sang Qiye?”</p><p>Yin Cao screamed in shock.</p><p>He was so scared that he even took a few steps back.</p><p>He thought those who would hide in the Heaven Prayer Forest must be weak.</p><p>However, he never expected that this person would be Sang Qiye!</p><p>Not everyone had seen Sang Qiye, and not everyone knew the second-in-command Saint Servant’s real name…</p><p>However, when Yama was first established, Lord Huang Quan had showed a few portraits of people who should never be provoked. The face in front was one of them.</p><p>The fear that came from the depths of his soul made Yin Cao choose to take a step back.</p><p>However, after a few steps, a large amount of current information surged into his mind after he regained his senses.</p><p>“Something’s wrong!”</p><p>Yin Cao suddenly reacted, “Why are you here? Aren’t you supposed to be the supervisor of the Holy Divine Palace…”</p><p>As he spoke, he suddenly stopped and pounced forward.</p><p>However, Sang Qiye took the opportunity when Yin Cao was in a daze. He grabbed one of the Three Loathsome Eyes and disappeared on the spot.</p><p>Yin Cao’s eyes instantly turned bloodshot.</p><p>He had been deceived!</p><p>At this moment, he finally realized that!</p><p>He had been deceived by a fake Sang Qiye as a Cutting Path!</p><p>But how did the other party do it?</p><p>That white flame which was full of calamity power, that face, someone who was able to call him the Storyteller, knowing that his mental state would definitely be affected…</p><p>This person must be very close to Sang Qiye despite not being the actual one!</p><p>With only one thought, Yin Cao made a judgment.</p><p>He even hesitated for a moment, as if he was still thinking. Then, in a flash, he attacked and suddenly stabbed at the other Three Loathsome Eyes.</p><p>With a snap, the Three Loathsome Eyes was caught in his palm.</p><p>The expected fight did not happen.</p><p>Under invisible state with only one hand seen, that person did not come out.</p><p>Yin Cao was silent.</p><p>That person was not greedy.</p><p>He did not take one and asked for another.</p><p>“As expected, as expected of you…”</p><p>Yin Cao suddenly laughed.</p><p>He put away the Three Loathsome Eyes, raised his head, looked around and said, “Should I call you Wen Ming, or Zhou Tianshen, Xiao Shi Tan Ji, Jiang Lan… or, should I call you by your real name, Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“Called, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou heard this, his heart turned cold.</p><p>At this moment, he just happened to hit the invisible wall. Enlightenment dawned on him that he was been drawn into Yin Cao’s bounded domain.</p><p>As expected, a fool could not cultivate to the Cutting Path…</p><p>There were many smart people in this world!</p><p>For him to be able to call out Xu Xiaoshou, it meant that he had done a lot of research.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that there must be an organization who could see through his disguise. They might come up with a way to break through the Vanishing Technique and Ascending to the Heavens in A Single Step.</p><p>However, he did not expect that this day would come so quickly.</p><p>He also did not expect that his fame would come so quickly that even the Cutting Path would be concerned about him.</p><p>“No response?”</p><p>Yin Cao appeared at the place where the bounded domain had been fluctuating, but he still couldn’t find Xu Xiaoshou. He was amazed and clicked his tongue in wonder.</p><p>“Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou, you really live up to your reputation!”</p><p>“You probably didn’t know that after your battle with Nine Serenities Ghost Child, Yama has studied you.”</p><p>“Your ability isn’t invincible… at the very least, the banishment ability with the Way of the Heavens by the Cutting Path would be able to restrain you.”</p><p>“I also know that you’re only invisible. You didn’t escape from my encirclement.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had disappeared, didn’t say anything.</p><p>He didn’t dare to reply, afraid that Yin Cao would find him.</p><p>But he didn’t sit still and wait for his death. At this time, Xu Xiaoshou had already taken out the Fourth Sword from his ring.</p><p>It did not matter whether he was the Cutting Path or the Higher Void.</p><p>With the Fourth Sword, Xu Xiaoshou wanted to see how Yin Cao would break the situation!</p><p>However, Yin Cao did not seem to be worried about Xu Xiaoshou’s surprise attack.</p><p>Yin Cao shook his head as he walked to the side of Hundred Ghost Night Walk. Yin Cao helped him up and healed his injuries. Then, he continued to say,</p><p>“As an Innate level expert, only the Cutting Path can restrain you. I have to say, you are simply a world-shocking prodigy!”</p><p>“I think that you should be able to tell that I have no ill intentions towards you. On the contrary, I am filled with affection.”</p><p>“As for you, I’m not sure…”</p><p>As he spoke, Yin Cao raised his head, and there was a look of amusement in his eyes. “If my deduction is correct, at this time, you should be holding Fourth Sword and trying to stab me, right? It seems like this is how Nine Serenities was injured?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was floating in mid-air and lurking to stab down, stopped moving.</p><p>This fellow…</p><p>Was he able to read minds?</p><p>Holding the Fourth Sword, and for a moment, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know whether it was better to stab down or not.</p><p>Yin Cao continued, “I’m full of heartfelt words of loyalty towards you, and I can even relax in front of you and let down all my defenses.”</p><p>“That is because our Lord Huang Quan from Yama likes you very much.”</p><p>“I didn’t expect to meet you so soon either. But here, I still have to ask on behalf of our Lord Huang Quan…”</p><p>After a pause, Yin Cao said seriously, “Xu Xiaoshou, do you want to join Yama?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>He originally thought that this was an enemy.</p><p>After all these, he didn’t expect that Yama would like to invite him as well.</p><p>The void was still quiet.</p><p>After saying so much, it was as if he was talking to himself, but there wasn’t the slightest bit of urgency in Yin Cao.</p><p>He even took out a sound recording bead and smiled as he shook it in the void.</p><p>“Perhaps you’ll think that I’m lying to you, but take a look. This is a sound recording bead that every Yama member carries everywhere.”</p><p>As he spoke, Yin Cao smiled and injected spiritual source into the sound recording bead.</p><p>Then, Huang Quan’s sincere voice was heard.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I am now sincerely inviting you.”</p><p>“Do you want to join Yama?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
