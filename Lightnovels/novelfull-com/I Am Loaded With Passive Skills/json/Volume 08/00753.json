Why do you not know what’s good for you?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cursed angrily. Then, he took out the Fourth Sword and aimed them at the top of Teng Shanhai’s head.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>A delicate shout came from the distance.</p><p>When he finished speaking, Xu Xiaoshou only felt that his hand, which was holding the Fourth Sword, was unable to control the vicious sword’s sudden violent will.</p><p>At that moment, Teng Shanhai grabbed this empty space and abruptly retreated.</p><p>At this moment, he admitted that he was a little scared…</p><p>That was the Fourth Sword!</p><p>How could Teng Shanhai not know that the Fourth Sword was on Xu Xiaoshou’s body?</p><p>It was this sword that completely shattered Yi’s Higher Void recovery ability.</p><p>If he was also stabbed, wouldn’t he be dead?</p><p>As for whether the Cang God Armor could block the Fourth Sword’s attack, Teng Shanhai didn’t even think about the possibility of taking it head-on.</p><p>The Cang God Armor also had gaps!</p><p>Just now, Xu Xiaoshou’s sword seemed to be aimed at the top of his head, but this kid’s eyes were clearly staring at the gaps in his Cang God Armor!</p><p>Vicious person…</p><p>On the other side, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but look back in shock as he suppressed the violent movements of the Fourth Sword.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>After receiving the recognition of the Bazhun’an, the vicious sword followed him.</p><p>Recognition was a must.</p><p>But this time, who was it that was able to recognize his vicious sword and even control it from a distance?</p><p>“It’s her…”</p><p>The graceful figure that flew over from afar was the one Xu Xiaoshou had seen with his spiritual senses. It was the woman with a sword on her back who had confronted the ghost beast of the Higher Void at the trade fair.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao!</p><p>At this moment, Rao Yaoyao’s face was filled with anger.</p><p>She had never thought that the one who would ruin that night’s plan would be such a junior.</p><p>It was a young man who had suddenly obtained a Saint Statue from god-knows-where and messed up the layout of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>What she hated the most were the two Chiefs who had been beaten to a disadvantage for various reasons.</p><p>The most serious thing was that one had even lost his physical body…</p><p>They were the Higher Void!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao felt her face burning.</p><p>The face of the Holy Divine Palace was almost destroyed by Yi and Teng Shanhai.</p><p>She did not know how the two involved had done all this.</p><p>If it were her, as a Higher Void, she would have pulled out her sword and killed herself on the spot after being beaten up by a junior!</p><p>“You are Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>When they were next to each other, Rao Yaoyao looked at him from afar.</p><p>Her beautiful eyes sized up this young man. Finally, her gaze was fixed on the phantom of the nine dragons behind him. She vaguely felt that this Saint Statue looked familiar.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sneered.</p><p>At this moment, he was blessed by the Saint Statue and protected by Holy Power.</p><p>This woman opposite him was just a Higher Void. What was there to be afraid of?</p><p>Higher Void. He had already fought two of them!</p><p>At this moment, the power of the Saint Statue had even reached its peak. It was still not on the verge of being defeated. Xu Xiaoshou felt that he could still fight two more.</p><p>There was only this one person opposite him. It was simply not enough.</p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Xiaoshou immediately flicked his sleeves, raised his head, and puffed out his chest.</p><p>“I don’t change my name, nor do I change my surname…”</p><p>“Saint Servant, Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who held the Fourth Sword, did not cower under the questioning of an expert and used an alias for the first time.</p><p>After finishing his sentence, he still felt dissatisfied and added, “My master Sang Qiye, grandmaster Long Rongzhi, who are you? Tell me your name, my vicious sword doesn’t kill the nameless Higher Void!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao did not feel that the person in front of her did not recognize her.</p><p>This kid was clearly red-eyed from killing. He was completely arrogant.</p><p>Moreover…</p><p>Long Rongzhi?</p><p>How could he dare to call the holy name directly?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao knew.</p><p>Ever since the news of Sang Qiye joining the Saint Servant was leaked a few decades ago, Demi-Saint Infernal of the Holy Palace had cut off all ties with his disciples.</p><p>It wasn’t as if the Holy Divine Palace hadn’t investigated.</p><p>But Demi-Saint Infernal had been disheartened over the past few decades and was now completely engrossed in the Art of Alchemy.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s words were clearly intended to divert the trouble and draw the battle line to another unrelated Demi-Saint, making the situation even more dire.</p><p>“Nine Dragons Burning the Ancestor…”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Rao Yaoyao understood why the Saint Statue behind Xu Xiaoshou looked familiar.</p><p>However, she immediately realized that this Saint Statue was not given by Demi-Saint Infernal. It could only have been passed down by his teacher, Sang Qiye.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had only inherited Demi-Saint Infernal’s Saint Statue. He had nothing to do with the reclusive saint who had devoted himself to the Art of Alchemy.</p><p>The Holy Palace was the training base for the Orthodox Saints of the continent.</p><p>Therefore, how could he have anything to do with a dark and evil force like the Saint Servant?</p><p>“Little Brat, you’re still young, but you’re quite arrogant.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao pulled out the Cang Godhood Sword from her back and looked at Xu Xiaoshou in the distance. She laughed, “After fighting two Higher Void, do you really think you can do it? Do you want to fight with me?”</p><p>She used the Cang Godhood Sword to point at him.</p><p>The void sword cracked open.</p><p>The sword will that filled the sky raged, like thunder on flat ground or a tsunami. It immediately pushed back and crushed Xu Xiaoshou’s aura that could swallow the mountains and rivers.</p><p>“Scorned, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Even though the information bar seemed to be goading Xu Xiaoshou, it made him want to move forward.</p><p>However, after being pointed at by this woman, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but feel a little… terrified!</p><p>He called her that woman…</p><p>But he understood that she was the sword deity!</p><p>If it was a different gender, it meant that the person who came would be called Gou Wuyue and Mei Siren.</p><p>Even though Xu Xiaoshou had brought the Saint Statue, he was not arrogant enough to think that he could stand at the same level as the sword deity.</p><p>It was fine to say that he wanted to and it was fine to think about it but if he was really invited to battle by sword deity, the true thoughts in the depths of his heart could not help but be exposed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had abused two Higher Void.</p><p>But of these two people, one underestimated the enemy, and the other humiliated the Saint.</p><p>The former was defeated by being caught unprepared.</p><p>The latter was because the holy will could not be desecrated, so he guided Xu Xiaoshou to make a move.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was arrogant on the surface, but he understood it as clear as a mirror in his heart.</p><p>How much did he have? Outsiders were frightened and did not know, but did he not know?</p><p>If he really thought that the opening of the Saint Stature was the Higher Void, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he might die in the next second.</p><p>However, he wanted to retreat.</p><p>There was Fourth Sword the vicious sword in his hand, and he felt an unyielding will.</p><p>Buzz…</p><p>The sound of the void sword rang out, and the vicious sword’s devilish energy overflowed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was surprised.</p><p>He seemed to have seen this situation before.</p><p>At that time, the Flame Python was born, and everyone had yet to draw their swords.</p><p>The Bewitching Demon, the famed sword of the Burial Sword Tomb, Gu Qinger, only used a small trick. The sword suppressed the Flame Python, which was also a famed sword, and forced the Flame Python to soar into the sky.</p><p>Even the imprisonment of the wretched saint was somewhat unable to suppress it.</p><p>This meant that the famed sword had a spirit. They argued with each other and did not give way.</p><p>If it was an ordinary sword, no matter how fierce it appeared in front of the vicious sword, Fourth Sword, it would probably not allow the Fourth Sword to have such a reaction.</p><p>This was because an expert disdained to be provoked by the weak.</p><p>However, when Rao Yaoyao pointed the longsword in her hand, the reaction of the Fourth Sword was so intense. This could only mean one thing.</p><p>This should at least be a spiritual sword of the same level as one of the five great chaotic divine instruments, right?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the sword and was momentarily distracted.</p><p>He hurriedly broke free from the predicament of the divine sword and frowned. “If you want me to fight with you, I can. What sword is this? Tell me its name.”</p><p>The arena was stunned by what he said.</p><p>Everyone looked at Xu Xiaoshou again with respect.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was so angry that her delicate body trembled.</p><p>It was one thing for this young man to be rampant, but he actually said such arrogant words and insulted a sword deity of the continent.</p><p>“If you want me to fight with you…”</p><p>What kind of vicious words was this?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had not even said that she wanted to bully the weak and suppress him.</p><p>His words had instead reversed the situation and mixed up the right and wrong!</p><p>“Lecherous prodigal son, shameless prodigal son.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao immediately cursed. She raised the Cang Godhood Sword in her hand and was about to attack.</p><p>But at this moment, Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have thought of something.</p><p>He soared into the air and raised his vicious sword again. He looked down from above, causing the Fourth Sword to look down at the longsword in his opponent’s hand.</p><p>The Cang Godhood Sword sensed the provocation and shook violently.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao almost lost control and wanted to shake the Cang Godhood Sword out of her hand.</p><p>The Cang Godhood Sword was a divine object that suppressed the fate of the Holy Divine Palace. It would not recognize an owner, much less a sword-bearer.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao came to the eastern region this time only because she wanted to have a look. She also invited the divine sword out of the Holy Divine Palace and played around with it.</p><p>At that moment, she did not care about anything else but the identity of the sword.</p><p>Even though Rao Yaoyao’s cultivation level was high, she could not compare to Xu Xiaoshou’s status as a sword-bearer of the Fourth Sword.</p><p>They were also the five great chaotic divine instruments.</p><p>One was a person recognized by the Fourth Sword.</p><p>The other was a person who only borrowed the power of the Cang Godhood Sword.</p><p>Who was stronger and who was weaker.</p><p>It was obvious at a glance.</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the reaction of the longsword opposite him and laughed.</p><p>He felt that this world was really interesting.</p><p>Even someone as strong as the five chaotic great divine instruments of the continent would be so childish. Just because of the difference in status, they would be angry.</p><p>This was too interesting!</p><p>Touching the body of the Fourth Sword, Xu Xiaoshou could feel the excitement coming from it.</p><p>This vicious sword was very arrogant.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had held the sword for so long. Other than the first time he met Bazhun’an, the Fourth Sword displayed extreme anger.</p><p>He had held the sword all the way and had never felt anything else from the Fourth Sword.</p><p>At that moment, this broken sword was actually smug because it was one body higher than the opposite sword – it was even funnier than Hidden Bitter!</p><p>“If I’m not wrong, this sword of yours is the Cang Godhood Sword, right?” Xu Xiaoshou smiled and told her the origin of the opposite sword.</p><p>He was no longer a country bumpkin.</p><p>Since he had truly decided to walk the path of the ancient swordsman, the famous Xu Xiaoshou had basically understood the spiritual sword of the continent.</p><p>The only one who could make the vicious sword have such a reaction and look like this, and who was worthy of the identity of one of the Seven Sword Deity, Rao Yaoyao, was the Holy Divine Palace’s Cang Godhood Sword.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao, who was opposite him, was already furious.</p><p>She really did not expect that Xu Xiaoshou could still use the Fourth Sword to suppress her on another level.</p><p>“Silence!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao could not help but lower her eyes and shout at the Cang Godhood Sword.</p><p>However, the Cang Godhood Sword had to be pampered.</p><p>In the face of intense resistance, Rao Yaoyao could not help but raise her position to satisfy the absurd will of the Cang Godhood Sword.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused. He smiled and said, “How can you bear to scold the Cang Godhood Sword, which is one of the five great chaotic divine instruments? You can’t do this. Unlike me, I will only feel sorry for the sword…”</p><p>As he said this, Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the vicious sword and caressed the sword body with his sword cognition.</p><p>“Hum…”</p><p>The Fourth Sword shook comfortably, and then the sword body trembled violently.</p><p>Everyone could see that this trembling was not the angry trembling of the Cang Godhood Sword, but an extremely comfortable performance.</p><p>“Witness Sword Technique?” Rao Yaoyao was stunned for a moment.</p><p>This was indeed something she did not know.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have received the true teachings of the Saint Servant, Bazhun’an.</p><p>“Sigh.”</p><p>On the other side, after showing off, Xu Xiaoshou’s figure once again rose higher and looked down from above.</p><p>The Cang Godhood Sword had a spirit.</p><p>It was fine if he didn’t compare it, but if he did, he would be even angrier.</p><p>More importantly, there was a sword will from the Fourth Sword on the other side. It was clearly the mean meaning of “My master has Witness Sword Technique, but your master doesn’t… Oh, I’m sorry, I forgot that you didn’t have a master.”.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>Immediately, the Cang Godhood Sword became even angrier.</p><p>Once it became angry, Rao Yaoyao also became angry.</p><p>At this moment, Rao Yaoyao simply regretted why she had invited the Cang Godhood Sword out of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>The key point was that she also understood that this wasn’t the fault of the Cang Godhood Sword, but Xu Xiaoshou and the wok with the Fourth Sword on the opposite side.</p><p>These two things were too disgusting.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had never seen such a disgusting combination.</p><p>It was simply…</p><p>Colluding together!</p><p>Smelly and congenial!</p><p>To grasp the Cang Godhood Sword’s unreconciled characteristic… it was clearly a characteristic of all spiritual swords, but it was still forcefully played into godhood!</p><p>However, the Cang Godhood Sword was pampered, so Rao Yaoyao could not really only scold it.</p><p>Before she made her move, she really had to satisfy the unreasonable demand of this broken sword – to increase its height and raise the sword’s position!</p><p>“Hehe, competing in height, right?”</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou saw this scene, he laughed so hard that he could not hold back his laughter. He said happily, “You are the Seven Sword Deity, why are you playing with such a brat like me?”</p><p>As he said that, Xu Xiaoshou flew again, making the Fourth Sword even higher.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao could not hold it in any longer. She drew her sword and was about to make her move.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou pointed with the Fourth Sword. He looked like he was saying, “Cang Godhood Sword, are you unable to play anymore? If you can’t play, then quickly admit defeat.”</p><p>The divine sword was furious. It actually broke away from Rao Yaoyao, who didn’t want to get taller and only wanted to kill people and flew up high.</p><p>???</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was shocked!</p><p>She couldn’t imagine that the Cang Godhood Sword would be played like this. This was just the lowest level of provocation!</p><p>Was it because the opponent was Fourth Sword?</p><p>Usually, she didn’t see any emotions in your sword!</p><p>Was it necessary???</p><p>Most importantly, the experience of Teng Shanhai’s divine spear being snatched away was still fresh in her mind. Xu Xiaoshou, who had the Saint Statue of the Nine Dragons Burning the Ancestor, was not someone she could kill with a single sword.</p><p>Therefore, Rao Yaoyao could not sit by and watch the Cang Godhood Sword fall into the enemy’s trap step by step.</p><p>If she were to be lured away by an outsider while playing, she would not be able to return to the Holy Divine Palace to explain herself.</p><p>Hence, Rao Yaoyao also flew up and grabbed her sword.</p><p>This was going to be fun!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled and said, “So Lord Seven Sword Deity really likes to play the game of children flying high. I, that Little Brat, will accompany you to the end!”</p><p>After saying that, Xu Xiaoshou went up again.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s aura was angered and she also went up again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou went up again.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s face was dark and she went up again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>Rao Yaoyao…</p><p>At this moment, the entire arena was dumbfounded.</p><p>Everyone thought that once Rao Yaoyao, one of the Seven Sword Deity, appeared, the arena would be filled with an earth-shattering battle.</p><p>Who would have thought that the arena would collapse into such a ghastly state in the blink of an eye!</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that one of the two sides had a Saint Statue, while the other was one of the Seven Sword Deity of the continent, and each of them held one of the five great chaotic divine instruments, everyone couldn’t help but burst out laughing.</p><p>And the most important thing was this.</p><p>Forget about the young Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s level was so high, how could she play such a game in front of everyone that would make people blush and be incomparably shy?</p><p>This was the legendary…</p><p>Battle of the divine instruments?</p><p>A pinnacle battle?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
