The crowd was excited.</p><p>On the stage, the Night Cat Second Manager, Nangong Yin, was completely unmoved.</p><p>The beast mask covered his face, so no one could see his expression. They could vaguely feel that Nangong Yin seemed to have expected this scene. He looked confident.</p><p>“Everyone, please be patient.”</p><p>Nangong Yin pressed his hands together. He did not open the Jade Box. Instead, he said calmly, “Indeed, there is a small flaw in the Bodhi Root. It can not be planted.”</p><p>“This is an innate treasure of The Beginning of Chaos. Without the Violet Qi of The Beginning of Chaos, it is impossible for the root to be planted and grow into the Bodhi Ancient Wood as everyone expected.”</p><p>“Therefore, the idea of planting the Bodhi Root in your sects to improve on luck is not practical… It’s nonsense!”</p><p>“However, this is not what I want to talk about.”</p><p>Nangong Yin looked around and pressed his hand on the Jade Box. His tone was as calm as ever.</p><p>“I mentioned earlier that the Bodhi Root can enhance one’s realization quality. That’s true.”</p><p>“That is what the Night Cat is selling the Bodhi Root for. That’s all.”</p><p>Everyone was speechless when they heard this.</p><p>Indeed, Nangong Yin didn’t hide anything earlier on.</p><p>What he mentioned had always been about increasing one’s realization quality.</p><p>It was just a subconscious fantasy of people from the various factions for thinking too highly of the Bodhi Root.</p><p>It was not bad for an ancient treasure to have one root left behind until now.</p><p>How could one expect that everything the Night Cat offer would be perfect and flawless?</p><p>However, Nangong Yin remained silent. If it wasn’t for the voice from Room 3, everyone would have probably made insane offers to bid for the wonderful illusions.</p><p>Thus, everyone could understand.</p><p>However, they couldn’t help but feel resentful after feeling cheated.</p><p>…</p><p>“Great, talking about the art of speech, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lamented as he listened in his room. Nangong Yin was absolutely ruthless.</p><p>Giving an illusory false hope was the most lethal!</p><p>He would not be fooled by this person’s words.</p><p>After all, the value of a treasure was fixed. If it was really rare, the Night Cat would not have offered it for sale.</p><p>However, the last few words by Nangong Yin stirred up his mind.</p><p>“Planting…”</p><p>“Others might not be able to plant it because of the lack of Chaotic Violet Qi.”</p><p>“But I have a lot of ‘Chaotic Mist’ from the beginning of the world in the Yuan Mansion. Does this count as ‘Chaotic Violet Qi’?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fell into deep thought.</p><p>He felt that the only difference between the “Chaotic Mist” and the “Chaotic Violet Qi” was the color.</p><p>He wondered if the dyeing method was feasible…</p><p>However, the world of Yuan Mansion had just evolved with the appearance of “Grass”(plant) and “Water”(vitality source). He also had the Spirit Mark of Life.</p><p>Perhaps he could really plant this “Bodhi Root”?</p><p>At the very least, if he failed to plant it, he could improve his “realization quality”, which was exactly fitted for him!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, get it. This is a good stuff,” Mu Zixi said anxiously.</p><p>“Why do you want everything?”</p><p>“This is really a good stuff. I can sense it…”</p><p>This time, Mu Zixi did not seem to be playing around. Instead, she seriously advised him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. He could tell that his junior sister was serious. Then, he remembered that she had wood attribute…</p><p>“Okay!”</p><p>“If I can’t plant the Bodhi Root, I can only use it to increase my realization quality. That’s for me.”</p><p>“But, if I use it for my junior sister with the wood attribute, perhaps she can utilize it better?”</p><p>Life-devouring Wood Physique… His conversation with Elder Sand about the special physique of junior sister suddenly flashed through his mind.</p><p>This physique was very special.</p><p>Elder sang’s evaluation was that although it was a spiritual physique, it had the potential to become a sacred physique. It was both good and evil. It was only a matter of a thought!</p><p>“Okay, then let’s get it.”</p><p>With that thought in mind, Xu Xiaoshou made his decision. He said, “I’ll give you five billion to bid. If it exceeds this price, I feel that it’s a little too much… Don’t bid it then!”</p><p>“Okay!” Mu Zixi’s small face immediately brightened with joy. She was about to speak.</p><p>“Calm down first…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickly covered the girl’s mouth.</p><p>Even he gave a limit of five billion, she didn’t have to make that bid immediately. It’s hard to say if anyone wanted this “Bodhi Root”!</p><p>If a few hundred million spirit crystal could settle the matter, wouldn’t the price of five billion be a loss?</p><p>Below the stage.</p><p>The scene was exactly what Xu Xiaoshou had expected.</p><p>The Bodhi Root was pulled down from its godhood. One would have to spend a long time to comprehend, but it could only occasionally increase the “realization quality”.</p><p>The huge difference from expectations caused many people to hesitate.</p><p>No one had tried it before, so they didn’t know how the “increase the realization quality” as Nangong Yin said.</p><p>What if it was better than nothing?</p><p>“100 million!”</p><p>“200 million.”</p><p>“I’ll bid 300 million.”</p><p>The scattered bids only appeared in the private seats.</p><p>The people in the private rooms were all silent.</p><p>As expected, the large factions weren’t short of treasures to improve their realization quality.</p><p>If the Bodhi Ancient Wood appeared in the arena, it would definitely be a great fight for it. After all, it was one of the Nine Great Ancestral Trees.</p><p>However, if it was just the “Bodhi Root”, it would be difficult to move the minds of these big shots…</p><p>One word, difficult!</p><p>100 million, 200 million.</p><p>It took an hour to barely get to 1.2 billion.</p><p>And every time, it happened when Nangong Yin was about to close the deal. The struggle in everyone’s hearts could be seen at a glance.</p><p>At this moment, when Nangong Yin was about to close the deal for the third time at 1.2 billion, Room 3 spoke.</p><p>“Two billion!”</p><p>Everyone was shocked and turned to look.</p><p>Room 3 was the one who lowered everyone’s expectations.</p><p>Now, at the end of the bid, Room 3 was the one who made the bid too.</p><p>With that, a lot of people were speculating.</p><p>“Was it intentional?”</p><p>“He purposely lowered expectations first, then he trades at a low price…”</p><p>“Room 3’s trick?”</p><p>As if seeing through everyone’s doubts, Room 3 did not stop after bidding. Instead, he continued.</p><p>“I believe that the Night Cat wouldn’t offer something that’s bad despite being incomplete.”</p><p>“With the legend of ‘Bodhi Ancient Wood’ alone, 1.2 billion is really a good deal.”</p><p>“2 billion to buy fame… We can give it to the juniors of the pavilion. If anyone wants to offer higher bid, just speak up, and we won’t fight over it.”</p><p>These words instantly extinguished the desires of the restless crowd.</p><p>Two billion wasn’t a small amount.</p><p>The key was that the moment Room 3 voiced out, whether intentionally or not, it revealed a piece of information.</p><p>“Juniors in the pavilion?”</p><p>“Pavilion…”</p><p>Within the Imperial City, there were many factions that had been conferred the title of Pavilion.</p><p>However, those who were qualified to sit in Room 3, which was a pretty high ranked room… Simultaneously, a name appeared in everyone’s mind.</p><p>Guiyin Pavilion!</p><p>The overlord of the Southern Zone!</p><p>Thinking of this, the people in the private seats found it hard to make any bid.</p><p>They couldn’t mess with this faction!</p><p>They had to take the risk of offending Guiyin Pavilion to bid for it. On top of that, they were unsure of the outcome after taking the treasure. They were truly freaked out.</p><p>“Dong.”</p><p>On the stage, Nangong Yin knocked on the small hammer and looked toward the Room 3.</p><p>“Room 3, this is a warning. Don’t beat around the bush and use your power to lower the price. Otherwise, Night Cat will ask you to leave the trade fair.”</p><p>“Sorry…”</p><p>Room 3 immediately responded, but his tone was full of indifference. “I didn’t mean it that way, but we will be careful next time.”</p><p>In the room, Xu Xiaoshou tilted his head and looked at his junior sister, “Add a little more.”</p><p>“Okay!”</p><p>Mu Zixi opened her mouth and was about to say something.</p><p>But at this moment, a voice came from the Room 183.</p><p>“2.1 billion.”</p><p>This voice was not modified by the beast mask. The clear charm in it was so obvious that people could immediately recognize the bidder.</p><p>It was a woman… Xu Xiaoshou could only get this.</p><p>The thoughts of the person in Room 183 were exactly the same as his.</p><p>“Which faction is it from?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately looked at Liu Lu.</p><p>Liu Lu’s eyes were blank as if he was eavesdropping. Then, his body trembled and said, “It’s from the Magic Pill Technicians Association. It’s President Dong Ling… Young Master Xu, this is not someone to be trifled with. This is the president of the Magic Pill Technicians Association in the capital’s headquarters. It’s the main association! Big shot!”</p><p>Below the stage, Nangong Yin’s little hammer knocked once again.</p><p>This time, there was not a hint of impatience in his tone. On the contrary, there was a trace of respect in his tone. “Room 183, first warning. Please put on the beast mask when you bid. Do not try to pressure others.”</p><p>“Oh, I’ll definitely do it next time.”</p><p>Room 183’s reply was as cold as before. She obviously did not have the time to put on the beast mask.</p><p>However, Nangong Yin remained silent and didn’t say anything else.</p><p>He didn’t even say “Night Cat will ask you to leave”. Instead, he was like if they insisted… then so be it! In any case, there’s nothing he could do about it.</p><p>This time, even the faction that was participating for the first time could sense something.</p><p>One shouldn’t mess with the people in Room 183, more so than the people in Room 3!</p><p>…</p><p>“Someone from the Magic Pill Technicians Association?”</p><p>In the room, Xu Xiaoshou frowned. To be honest, he didn’t have a good impression of the Magic Pill Technicians Association.</p><p>After all, he should definitely be more than a tenth-grade elixir master.</p><p>However, that funny Association was so stingy that they were only willing to give him a tenth-grade badge.</p><p>1</p><p>As he was thinking, Xu Xiaoshou patted his junior sister’s shoulder.</p><p>Mu Zixi immediately understood and opened her mouth, “Three billion!”</p><p>What?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s little heart immediately twitched.</p><p>Good heavens, didn’t he say to add a little more?</p><p>That was a disrespect to the Magic Pill Technicians Association. One should never be so blunt no matter how upset he was!</p><p>Liu Lu, who was listening from the side, wiped off his cold sweat and continued to numb himself.</p><p>“I didn’t say anything, Young Master Xu doesn’t know anything either. He only increased the price because he didn’t know that they’re from the Magic Pill Technicians Association.”</p><p>“Yes, that’s right!”</p><p>…</p><p>Room 183.</p><p>Dong Ling’s legs were crossed as she sat on the sofa. Like a blooming lotus, her temperament was pure and refined.</p><p>Holding a beast mask in her hand, her jade-like fingers were gripping the mask tight. There was a look of surprise on her face.</p><p>Generally speaking, the major factions in the capital would recognize her voice, because it was too iconic.</p><p>For a trade fair like this, once the Magic Pill Technicians Association spoke, they would obtain the treasure they wanted at the lowest price.</p><p>This was an undeniable fact.</p><p>Once the Magic Pill Technicians Association spoke, sometimes the organizers would forcefully stop others from bidding.</p><p>After all, it was nothing to lose a treasure compared to the desperation of having no one to cure them on the verge of death in the future.</p><p>However, at this very moment, Room 172 acted like a newborn calf and placed the bid as if they were seeking death.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Without turning her head, Dong Ling asked the Night Cat’s receptionist.</p><p>The receptionist hesitated for a moment before saying, “Normally, Night Cat will strictly keep such private information confidential. However, if it’s President Dong Ling, we can have exceptions…”</p><p>“Cut the crap!” Dong Ling interrupted.</p><p>The receptionist was stunned for a moment before she started blabbering, “It’s the First Pavilion in the Sky! Xu Deye has someone with wood attribute by his side. He should also be eyeing this wood attribute treasure. It’s not a malicious bid.”</p><p>After a pause, the receptionist seemed to have received instructions and helped to explain, “The First Pavilion in the Sky is new here. I’m sure they still don’t know the identity of President Dong Ling.”</p><p>With that, the receptionist immediately left.</p><p>Everyone was smart, so there was no need to say too much.</p><p>But with her words, the other people in the room clearly didn’t seem to be as unhappy as they had expected.</p><p>Instead, they looked at each other in surprise.</p><p>No one had expected that…</p><p>After searching for a long time, the First Pavilion in the Sky had come knocking on their door.</p><p>“Xu Deye?”</p><p>Zhou Tianshen raised his eyebrows and suddenly looked at Hua Ying. Then, he quickly raised his brows again with an expression of “it’s coming”.</p><p>Hua Ying definitely knew that the “First Pavilion in the Sky” was the faction that Young Master Xu was most likely to be as expected by Zhou Tianshen.</p><p>She immediately looked at President Dong Ling.</p><p>Dong Ling smiled, “Do as you think it’s appropriate. Name your price, and count the bill on me.”</p><p>In the blink of an eye, she let go of the thought of snatching the treasure.</p><p>At this moment, it was obvious that the mission of the Holy Palace to find the person was of much greater priority.</p><p>Although the Bodhi Root was also a divine object for conducting alchemy, it was obviously not as important as Hua Ying’s mission.</p><p>Su Qianqian stepped forward from the side. Under the beast mask, her eyes were fixed on the windowsill of Room 172. Although she could not see the person inside clearly, she felt a sense of palpitation.</p><p>It seemed like the person she vowed to look for and bid farewell to was right in front of her.</p><p>“What should I do?”</p><p>Hua Ying was a little anxious. She was now on the opposite side of Young Master Xu.</p><p>To attract Young Master Xu’s attention, there was probably only one way to do it. However, if she were to bid against Young Master Xu, she would be beaten to death, right?</p><p>“Zhou Tianshen…” Hua Ying looked at Zhou Tianshen as if she was asking for help.</p><p>Under the beast mask, Zhou Tianshen looked confused.</p><p>He did not know what was going on in this world. Out of nowhere, he had become the backbone of this private room. For a moment, he could not help but shout in his heart, “Why are you looking at me? What can I do?”</p><p>However, on the surface, he tried his best to convey an attitude of “you can count on me”.</p><p>A thought flashed through his mind, Zhou Tianshen suggested, “Provoke him and let someone else from that room to speak… As long as he speaks, I can smell it from ten rooms away. I can detect if it’s the right person.”</p><p>Hua Ying was stunned and exasperated.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Provoke Young Master Xu?</p><p>Perhaps she should have beaten Zhou Tianshen first, alright?</p><p>With the speed of light, he dropped this suggestion that was almost impossible. At this moment, the black-robed beast-masked man below had already shouted “Second time”. The transaction was about to be successful.</p><p>Hua Ying was anxious. She tidied up the beast mask on her face and climbed onto the windowsill. She immediately shouted,</p><p>“2.1 billion!”</p><p>“Stop bidding, you.. After I get this treasure, come to my room. I’ll give it to you!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
