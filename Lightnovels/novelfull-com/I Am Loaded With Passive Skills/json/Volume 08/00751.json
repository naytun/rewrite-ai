I Would Chop off Another Higher Void</p><p><strong>Translator:</strong> Nyoi-Bo Studio <strong>Editor:</strong> Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>He punched out.</p><p>A high-frequency and ear-piercing vibration from a Higher Void reverberated in the air, and everything began to distort.</p><p>“Flash!”</p><p>In a split second, a crafty look flashed across Yi’s eyes.</p><p>After that, his body, which had its back facing Xu Xiaoshou, had used up all of his momentum when he pounced forward. When the power had just left and the new power had yet to be born, he actually used his spiritual source and shifted several times to the side.</p><p>“Little guy…”</p><p>After doing all this, Yi looked back with a funny expression.</p><p>He was sure that even though Xu Xiaoshou had activated the Saint Statue and mastered the Holy Power, he still couldn’t attack Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>After all, he didn’t have enough battle experience, so he couldn’t attack Xu Xiaoshou after he made a small mistake.</p><p>However, he turned around.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s punch, which should have been missed, was like a maggot in his bones. It was still magnified in his eyes.</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>The astonishment on Yi’s face only appeared for a second.</p><p>In the next second, a terrifying force came.</p><p>Boom!!!</p><p>A loud explosion sounded.</p><p>The straw hat on Yi’s old face, which had turned into Elder Sang, was the first to be knocked away and shattered.</p><p>Then, under the effect of the tremendous force, his facial features suddenly caved in to the back of his head, and his face was completely distorted.</p><p>Once again, the fragile neck bones that connected his upper and lower body to his neck shattered with a light sound…</p><p>Crack!</p><p>A head drew an afterimage in the air.</p><p>When it reappeared, it was already several hundred feet away in midair.</p><p>At this moment, time slowed down.</p><p>The headless corpse below and the young man who had raised his eyes and smiled were completely frozen in the memories of Yi’s head!</p><p>Up to this point, all of this was just the aftermath of the Holy Power.</p><p>When the Passive Fist was the second force and Xu Xiaoshou had used up all of the Infernal Original Seed’s explosive power, a black hole appeared in the sky.</p><p>The head that had been blown away exploded into a black hole in the sky.</p><p>It was completely destroyed.</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>It was only then that Xu Xiaoshou’s voice started to ring out.</p><p>“You might have predicted my prediction, but I also don’t think that a higher void like you would be able to take a punch from me so easily…”</p><p>“So, I’m aiming at your Holy Power’s aura!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s lips parted as he grinned.</p><p>He had already decided to use the Passive Fist to defeat this old man, so how could he allow this punch to miss?</p><p>As the Chief of the other division, Yi must have experienced hundreds of battles.</p><p>And the other party had given him a flaw, so Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know whether it was true or not.</p><p>But whether it was true or not, his punch didn’t stop at all.</p><p>No matter what kind of spiritual technique Yi used, no matter where he flashed to, his Ascending to the Heavens in A Single Step must catch up, and then, this punch had to hit this Elder Sang’s old face.</p><p>The funny thing was…</p><p>The opponent seemed to really treat him, Xu Xiaoshou, as an Innate junior who had no combat experience.</p><p>He only flashed once before he stopped.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s punch was so cautious that he had used Ascending to the Heavens in A Single Step more than five times.</p><p>Although other than the first time, he was always moving in place.</p><p>But he was afraid of missing!</p><p>The moment Yi consumed the Saint Blood, Xu Xiaoshou knew that his chance had come.</p><p>The power of the Higher Void could not completely conceal the aura of the Holy Path. This was the fundamental reason why he was sure that Yi would be exposed under his punch!</p><p>Shaking his arm, Xu Xiaoshou was in so much pain that he was panting.</p><p>He looked down at his completely shattered right arm, but because of the Holy Power, his right arm did not explode after the Passive Fist.</p><p>However, it was not far from exploding…</p><p>It could not be used at all!</p><p>To be honest, the amount of power that Passive Fist had accumulated this time was not as much as the previous time.</p><p>This was because during this period of time, Xu Xiaoshou had received very few attacks.</p><p>However, after accumulating for so long, his power was not small either.</p><p>In addition, he had the Saint Blood and the power of the Saint Statue.</p><p>Therefore, Xu Xiaoshou looked at the headless body in front of him. Although he did not know if Yi was dead or not, he still felt that even if he was not dead, he would still be heavily injured, right?</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>He used his foot to hook the headless body that was falling downwards.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought for a moment. This was a Higher Void. He had also drunk the Saint Blood. One punch was not safe at all…</p><p>Therefore, he used his left hand to pull out Fourth Sword. From top to bottom, he nailed the vicious sword into the headless body, leaving only the hilt.</p><p>“Hu…”</p><p>After doing all this, Xu Xiaoshou let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>“Demi-saint’s Power…”</p><p>“Awesome!”</p><p>The Saint Blood given by Elder Sang was too powerful.</p><p>This allowed Xu Xiaoshou to use the Saint Statue without having to go through the long process of increasing the Holy Power in the battle when Jiang Xian summoned the Holy Power.</p><p>In just a few breaths, the Holy Power in Xu Xiaoshou’s Saint Statue was full.</p><p>“So, is he dead?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the headless body in front of him, which had started to spread the Devil Veins and devilish energy due to the penetration of the Fourth Sword.</p><p>In his “Perception”, there was no more Yi’s breath, only a body in front of him.</p><p>He had never faced Higher Void in such a way. He was fighting head-on. Xu Xiaoshou even didn’t know if the Higher Void was dead after being hurt to such a stage.</p><p>The first time was always inexperienced…</p><p>So Xu Xiaoshou keep an eye on this headless body, to prevent fake death.</p><p>However, he seemed to be worrying too much.</p><p>After the devilish energy of the Fourth Sword overflowed, the headless body suddenly swelled up.</p><p>Then, with a bang, it exploded into pieces.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou caught the Fourth Sword, which had been exposed to the air again. He was still very worried.</p><p>He swept his gaze across the area. Infernal White Flame directly cremated the remaining body and helped Yi walk through the final process of his life.</p><p>“It’s completely gone.”</p><p>“Now, it should mean that he’s truly dead, right?”</p><p>Up until this point, Xu Xiaoshou still felt uneasy.</p><p>He always felt that Higher Void would not die so easily, but the death and fall that he remembered was probably nothing more than this.</p><p>He had also seen the death of a Sovereign.</p><p>Even if his body was not completely shattered, just half of his head was blown off meant that half of his foot had already been sent to hell.</p><p>At most, he could only crawl and struggle for a moment, and use a symbolic counterattack like the dying flash, such as Red Dog.</p><p>But now that his body had completely dissipated…</p><p>It was normally impossible for him to be revived.</p><p>“Spiritual senses!”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly thought of spiritual senses.</p><p>He was used to using his “Perception”. Normally, he wouldn’t use something as low-level as spiritual senses to probe the surroundings.</p><p>But now, he had Holy Power…</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou closed his eyes to probe, and when he opened them again, he was filled with shock.</p><p>With the augmentation of the power of the Saint Statue, the range of his spiritual senses could almost cover the entire Dongtianwang City, and he even had a lot of spare power!</p><p>Spiritual senses reached out.</p><p>This included the large group of people at the trade fair who were inexplicably shocked as they looked in his direction…</p><p>This included the Higher Void ghost beast, a female Higher Void with a sword on her back, as well as the night guardian, Lan Ling, and the others who had become rather inconspicuous…</p><p>There was also fighting stopped not too far away. Teng Shanhai, the storyteller, Wang Dachui, and the scruffy-looking man were also looking at him in shock…</p><p>Finally, there was Master Siren who had stopped a few streets away…</p><p>Everyone was looking at him!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>It wasn’t just that.</p><p>Outside of the white Dragon Melting Realm that was like a blazing sun hanging in the sky above the central zone, there was a group of broken walls and mournful sceneries.</p><p>The bounded domain had shattered!</p><p>Therefore, after the Dragon Melting Realm was in the sky, the shockwaves had spread to a radius of more than ten miles, and almost no intact buildings could be preserved.</p><p>That was the aftermath of Holy Power, and it was extremely terrifying!</p><p>There were too many spiritual cultivators in the Imperial City.</p><p>Almost before the battle began, many people sensed that something was wrong and promptly changed their positions.</p><p>However, there were still too many people who could not run far. Right now, they were not burned by the white flame, but they were also injured and killed by Xu Xiaoshou’s burst of white flame’s Holy Power…</p><p>Yes!</p><p>It was just a single explosion, and too many innocent people had died!</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou watched in silence.</p><p>He finally understood why the battle of the Sovereigns had to take place in the bounded domain or in the air.</p><p>However, this world was cruel like this.</p><p>The weak were prey to the strong, and the worst would be eliminated.</p><p>When immortals fought, mortals would suffer.</p><p>Numerous frightened, shocked, and respectful gazes were cast over, and Xu Xiaoshou felt mixed emotions for a moment.</p><p>“I’m sorry…”</p><p>At that moment, there was nothing else he could do other than to apologize.</p><p>He had no choice but to retaliate in self-defense.</p><p>And after he retaliated…</p><p>This was the cruel reality…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou composed himself and returned to his normal state.</p><p>He no longer had any pity in his heart.</p><p>From the moment he stepped onto the path of spiritual cultivation, everyone should have been prepared to succeed.</p><p>It was like entering a battlefield.</p><p>Those who are merciful could not control the army.</p><p>Mercy would only sink them into a bigger swamp.</p><p>At the same time, every spiritual cultivator should be prepared for a calamity to fall from the sky one day.</p><p>After all, this was the spiritual cultivation world. This was the predestined fate.</p><p>That day, it was Xu Xiaoshou who summoned the power of the Saint Statue and destroyed the stability of one side.</p><p>Perhaps the next day, it would be another immortal fighting and putting the disaster on others.</p><p>People who were greedy for peace and happiness were only suitable to live in a remote corner of the secular world. They had no right to set foot in the cruel world of spiritual cultivation!</p><p>…</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>At this moment, Mei Siren flew over and asked the young man in front of him.</p><p>“Master Siren.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded in greeting and no longer hid it.</p><p>After the young man’s battle, Master Siren’s attention was more focused on the bystanders who were affected by the aftermath of his battle.</p><p>At that moment, he regained his senses.</p><p>Indeed, the person in front of him was really just a young man, and he was only an Innate…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou actually didn’t think too much about this at this moment. He asked, “Master Siren, I beat a Higher Void, but I’m not sure if he’s dead or not…”</p><p>“He ran away.” Mei Siren had witnessed everything. How could he not know what was going on.</p><p>“He ran away?” Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>This result was reasonable and unexpected.</p><p>Mei Siren laughed, “You’re only at the Innate. Even with the help of the Saint Statue, you were able to severely injure the Higher Void. Isn’t it something you should be proud of? What do you expect? You want him to die on the spot for you?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>He thought for a long time before saying, “His head is gone, and his body has been stabbed by the vicious sword. He can’t survive.”</p><p>“Are you sure that there’s nothing left?” Mei Siren asked.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded with certainty, “Everything about him has been shattered. I can also feel the Holy Power on the other side. Even if he consumed the Saint Blood, it’s completely useless.”</p><p>Mei Siren was silent.</p><p>This was just Innate…</p><p>How did he say that he could do all of this in a normal and natural manner?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s Saint Statue was too powerful!</p><p>To be honest, this was the first time Mei Siren had seen someone who could use the full power of the Saint Statue without the need to increase his combat strength.</p><p>He didn’t know how Xu Xiaoshou had done it.</p><p>But if it had been anyone else, the one who would have died would have been the one who had summoned the Saint Statue. How could he have seriously injured the opponent, the Higher Void?</p><p>But it was because Xu Xiaoshou’s Saint Statue was too strange.</p><p>The power of the Higher Void might not be as powerful as a DemiSsaint, but it was too easy for the Holy Power to suppress the power of the Higher void.</p><p>It was like a baby picking up a machete, but there was actually a giant supporting it. If the baby made a cut, the giant would also make a cut.</p><p>Perhaps the baby’s cut was not very painful, but the giant’s slash was very painful!</p><p>It was so painful that even Mei Siren would have to retreat.</p><p>Under such circumstances, the enemy of the baby holding the machete was only a normal adult…</p><p>At most, it was just a slight increase in combat strength after consuming the giant’s blood.</p><p>Therefore, the Yi’s defeat seemed to be…</p><p>Justifiable?</p><p>Shaking his head slightly, Mei Siren turned his complicated thoughts back to Xu Xiaoshou’s doubts and said, “He didn’t die, and you didn’t completely destroy him.”</p><p>“Impossible…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou subconsciously retorted.</p><p>However, the words of Mei Siren made him sink into deep thought.</p><p>His head was gone.</p><p>His body was also gone.</p><p>Clothes, weapons, spiritual sources, and the like were even more impossible to exist.</p><p>And Yi was obviously not the Higher Void after the final-stage of the Sovereign. There was no way of relying on the Way of the Heavens to be reborn.</p><p>So, what else was left out?</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou thought about it, he suddenly came to a decision and his pupils constricted.</p><p>“Sugar-coated haws?”</p><p>When he thought about this, he was a little shocked.</p><p>Could it be the sugar-coated haws that Yi had used to pierce through his chest and then fell behind him, completely ignored by the two people in the battle?</p><p>It seemed that this was the only thing that Xu Xiaoshou had not destroyed that came from Yi’s body?</p><p>When Mei Siren heard this, he nodded slightly. “Higher Void is very difficult to die. It can use all kinds of methods to escape and avoid the chance of death. Moreover, you are facing the Chief of a different division, so what you are saying is only a possibility. It is not absolute.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless. He was a little stunned after hearing this. Then, he asked humbly, “Then how can we make Higher Void die more thoroughly?”</p><p>Mei Siren’s lips twitched when he heard this.</p><p>He was an Innate!</p><p>Had he forgotten his role!</p><p>What exactly was he thinking in his head!</p><p>“Perception.”</p><p>Sighing, Mei Siren answered seriously, “Or rather, spiritual intelligence. If you completely wipe out the spiritual intelligence of the Higher Void, you can let him die completely. When the ‘mind’ is not there, the ‘form’ is useless.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have understood something.</p><p>With this thought, the entire world fell silent.</p><p>After a long while, Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyes and asked seriously, “Master Siren, is this Saint Statue of mine very powerful?”</p><p>Mei Siren was stunned.</p><p>He looked behind Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>At this time, Holy Power appeared and turned into a phantom.</p><p>Behind Xu Xiaoshou, there were nine white flame dragons that blotted out the sky, baring their fangs and brandishing their claws, roaring angrily.</p><p>It was an illusion.</p><p>However, the higher one’s cultivation level was, the more real the power they saw was, and the stronger it was!</p><p>Even the Demi-Saint had to secretly use more than half of his power if he wanted to remain calm on the surface just by standing in front of the Saint Statue.</p><p>That was because once the Saint Statue appeared, what outsiders were facing was no longer the summoner himself, but the Demi-Saint’s will.</p><p>Looking at it, Mei Siren couldn’t help but swallow his saliva. Then, he said solemnly, “Very strong! This is the ‘Nine Dragons Burning the Ancestor’, right? I’ve only seen it on Mu Ling of the Holy Palace. Is it a Saint Statue passed down by Demi-Saint Infernal?”</p><p>“Yes.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded.</p><p>“By the way, how did your Saint Statue suddenly rise to the highest value of Holy Power? This… is very unusual.” Mei Siren asked the questions in his heart.</p><p>“It’s just a small trick.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not explain much.</p><p>He sensed that many people around him had already heard the news and moved. In the end, he asked, “Master Siren, would you be afraid of this Saint Statue of mine?”</p><p>Afraid?</p><p>Mei Siren was stunned when he heard it. He suddenly laughed, “How could I be afraid?”</p><p>Ta ta ta…</p><p>A rapid and clear sound rang out, very untimely.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not leave any traces. He stole a glance at the Mei Siren, who was fanatically tapping his palm.</p><p>He then understood without the information bar’s verification.</p><p>This Saint Statue was very powerful!</p><p>He was so powerful that at this moment, he was like the main character of the Way of the Heavens!</p><p>“I understand…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who immediately understood everything, nodded slightly. He turned his head and looked in the direction of the storyteller. Finally, his gaze fixed on Teng Shanhai as he calmly said, “Master Siren, please wait for a moment. Allow me to chop off another Higher Void.. I will come back and have a long talk with you.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
