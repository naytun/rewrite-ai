There’s someone behind me!”</p><p>Then the enemy retreated..</p><p>Impossible.</p><p>Impossible!</p><p>Even the identity of the demi-saint’s descendant of the first pavilion in the sky was fabricated by Xu Xiaoshou himself.</p><p>A Fox deceives a fox.</p><p>These things were not effective when facing a strong enemy.</p><p>However!</p><p>Now that Elder sang had placed three pill bottles in front of him, Xu Xiaoshou could feel that the energy inside was very majestic. It could even be said that it was terrifying.</p><p>This was the real trump card!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou understood that this time, the Elder Sang would not prepare three more bottles of origin court pill for no reason.</p><p>This was because the other party had constructed the great void world so that his disciple (apprentice) could use it to defeat demi-saint after encountering the higher void (level).</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Elder Sang with Hope.</p><p>Elder Sang smiled and stopped beating around the bush. Instead, he pointed at the first bottle and said, “This is the virtual image.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>“Virtual image?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Elder sang nodded and continued, “The process of making a virtual image is very difficult. It even requires years of effort from the higher void families. Normally, even the higher void family (ies) who are not the most valued disciples would not receive a gift from their elders.”</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou was certain that the virtual image that the Elder Sang mentioned was the virtual image that he had seen before.</p><p>Back in Tian sang city, Zhang Taiying’s empress virtual image had left a deep impression on him.</p><p>At that time, the other party couldn’t even move.</p><p>However, with the protection of the virtual image, Xu Xiaoshou, and Jia Xin had transformed into a berserk giant and a ghost beast respectively.</p><p>In the end, they couldn’t even break through the defense of the virtual image even though they were almost exhausted to death!</p><p>That was until Aje’s kick ended everything.</p><p>However, that was the only protection of the virtual image that Zhang Taiying couldn’t control.</p><p>If the opponent could unleash the power of the virtual image…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou believed that even with Aje in that battle, he might not be able to take down Zhang Taiying.</p><p>“Do you have a name?”Xu Xiaoshou came back to his senses and asked.</p><p>He remembered that the virtual image had a name. For example, Zhang Taiying’s “Empress virtual image” sounded very domineering.</p><p>He shouted before the battle.</p><p>The enemy’s aura was weakened by a third.</p><p>However, the Elder Sang shook his head. “I’ve never made a virtual image for anyone in my life. This is the first one, and I haven’t named it yet.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said, “Then you take one. I’ve decided to accept this gift.”</p><p>Elder sang’s eyelids twitched when he heard this.</p><p>This tone was as if the other party was giving something to him.</p><p>But he didn’t care.</p><p>After some consideration, elder sang pondered for a while and said, “Then let’s call it ‘Black Flame Godhood’!”</p><p>“Black?”Xu Xiaoshou was slightly confused.</p><p>The infernal lineage was all white flame, so how could it be called ‘black’.</p><p>But on second thought, elder Sang’s famous ultimate skill did not seem to be white flame, but rather his own ‘sleeveless, red scorched hand’.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had seen that pair of scorched black hands in the eighth palace.</p><p>It was absolutely scorching!</p><p>It could even scorch the way of the heavens, it was simply invincible.</p><p>At that moment, he understood why elder sang had named it “Black Flame God”.</p><p>He grabbed the pill bottle and Xu Xiaoshou looked at the second one. “What about this one?”</p><p>Elder sang shook his head when he saw his disciple’s anxious look, but he didn’t say anything. He pointed at the second bottle on the ground. “This is the saint statue.”</p><p>“Huh?”Xu Xiaoshou’s heart immediately stopped beating. His eyes were filled with shock. “Saint? You Didn’t misspeak?”</p><p>The oppressive feeling brought by the heavenly prayer forest’s Jiang Xian saint statue was still vivid in his mind.</p><p>If it weren’t for the fact that King Yama and Jiang Xian were already prepared, they might even have prepared a lot.</p><p>The only thing that the two great cutting paths (stage) could do in front of the saint statue was to kneel down and bow.</p><p>Elder sang also had a saint statue?</p><p>Elder sang seemed to have noticed Xu Xiaoshou’s doubt, and he smiled. “This is the saint statue left behind by Your Grandmaster. However, I have already broken with him and don’t want to use it, so I left it for you to use.”</p><p>“Are you crazy?!”</p><p>After Xu Xiaoshou recovered from his shock, the first thing that came to his mind was not himself, but the arrow from Ai Cangsheng from the Eighth Palace.</p><p>If elder sang had activated the holy statue at that time, would it have been possible for him to defend against AI Cangsheng’s arrow from the Evil Sin Bow?</p><p>No!</p><p>It was not possible!</p><p>It should have been completely possible..</p><p>“Pa.”</p><p>Elder sang suddenly leaned forward and gave Xu Xiaoshou a heavy blow. “How can you talk like that!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at him with a half-sorrowful and half-inquisitive gaze.</p><p>He then let out a long sigh and said disappointedly, “Xu Xiaoshou, you are indeed very smart, but some things are not as simple as you think.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”Xu Xiaoshou was confused.</p><p>Elder sang pointed at the top of his head and said with a mysterious smile,</p><p>“I should have told you that there is a sky beyond the sky, and there is a sky beyond the sky.”</p><p>“There are some things that you think you have broken through three levels, but in fact, there are five levels.”</p><p>“Even with your current talent and ability, even if you can see three levels, I can tell you that those three levels are just what others want you to see.”</p><p>“What you can see with your ability will always be the tip of the iceberg in this world.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fell into deep thought.</p><p>What did this mean?</p><p>He didn’t use the holy statue and chose to be shot..</p><p>Could this be Elder Sang’s plan?</p><p>Elder sang wanted to enter the prison of the Holy Divine Palace by himself?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked by this idea and immediately denied it.</p><p>Impossible!</p><p>If elder sang wanted to, he could have taken the stairs and entered the prison when Gou Wuyue made his move a few years ago.</p><p>Why did he have to wait for Ai Cangsheng’s arrow?</p><p>Moreover, what was the purpose of entering the prison?</p><p>To serve the punishment of the Holy Divine Palace?</p><p>Elder sang was actually..</p><p>“Slap!”</p><p>Just as he was thinking, elder sang slapped Xu Xiaoshou to wake him up and scolded him:</p><p>“Don’t even think about it. I’ll say it again. Before you have absolute strength, be serious and be a good chess piece!”</p><p>“There are many smart people in this world. One Dao Qiongcang is enough for you to drink more than one pot.”</p><p>“Do you really think that your current ability can be compared to the people of the previous era?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head. “I’m not that conceited…”</p><p>Elder sang immediately interrupted, “But what I’m facing now, and what you’re going to face in the future, is far more than just Dao Qiongcang!”</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly looked up and was enlightened.</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>He was indeed just a junior, so there was no need to think so much.</p><p>However, what elder sang and Bazhun’an were fighting against was the peak of this world.</p><p>Such a figure, whether friend or foe, if he could really be thought of by a junior like him, could he still be called a mighty figure?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>Elder sang suddenly said in a deep voice, “Remember, you can put your eyes on your peers for the time being, but to surpass them and even catch up with people of the same generation, you must not only see your peers, or even just the previous generation!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was silent.</p><p>He recognized Elder Sang’s voice-over.</p><p>How terrifying was this reality?</p><p>He, Xu Xiaoshou, was born a generation later, but he had to chase after a generation.</p><p>But at the same time, the people of the previous generation would not stay where they were. They would only try their best to chase after the previous generation.</p><p>Everyone seemed to be “Blindly”rushing towards a “Goal”.</p><p>There seemed to be a goal.</p><p>But they could not see where the target was.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that his description of this “Blindness”was very correct.</p><p>As for the “Target”..</p><p>Or rather, it could not be said to be a “Target”. It should be said to be an “Answer”.</p><p>The “Answer”hidden in the deepest parts of the continent that everyone was chasing but could not give.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had once asked.</p><p>Most people could not give it.</p><p>Even elder sang had never said it out loud.</p><p>But Bazhun’an had given it to him.</p><p>That “Answer”was called “Freedom”.</p><p>Whether it was the absolute control of the holy divine palace, the “Qiu Long Words” that elder sang had mentioned, or the “Otherworldly people” that Bazhun’an had vividly told Xu Xiaoshou in the White Cave.</p><p>Everything could be classified as “For freedom”.</p><p>However, the “Freedom”that the holy divine palace wanted to give to the mainland seemed to be completely different from the “Freedom”that elder sang and the Bazhun’an had understood.</p><p>“It’s a very serious mainland-level internal scroll…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought about it and gave such a conclusion. He sighed speechlessly.</p><p>At this moment, elder sang’s figure blurred, and the world blurred. It was as if everything was about to disappear.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou came back to his senses in shock. “What? Is it time? Are you going to die again?”</p><p>“Pa.”</p><p>Elder sang suddenly slapped him angrily again. “What a load of Bullsh * t!”</p><p>This time, he did not waste any more words. Instead, he went back to the main topic. He pointed at the second pill bottle and said,</p><p>“This holy image is called ‘nine dragons burning the ancestor’. With your current cultivation level, if you summon it, you will kill 1,000 enemies and lose 800 yourself. So…”</p><p>Elder sang spoke faster and pointed at the third pill bottle. “This is a bottle of holy blood, and it came from your grandmaster. Before summoning the holy image, take a drop of it to save your life.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked and asked in shock, “A bottle of Holy Blood?”</p><p>If he remembered correctly.</p><p>The unit of measurement for holy blood seemed to be… a drop?</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Elder sang nodded. “A whole bottle of Holy Blood, full! I said that I had broken with your grandmaster long ago, so I didn’t use his things. But after all, it’s Your Grandmaster’s blood, and it’s hard to come by. You have to use it carefully, and there will be no more after you use it.”</p><p>“One bottle, how many drops?”Xu Xiaoshou swallowed his saliva.</p><p>“About a dozen drops. I don’t know, who would count this for no reason?”</p><p>“Anyway, it’s enough for you!”</p><p>Elder sang flicked his sleeves and paused for a moment, he added, “Oh right, this is the holy blood specially made by your grandmaster. Don’t forget that he’s also a pretty good elixir master. Therefore, this holy blood doesn’t have any overbearing side effects of other holy blood. Even when you’re on the verge of death, you can treat it as a healing holy medicine like ‘God’s blessing’and consume it.”</p><p>“Gulu ~”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was really frightened.</p><p>This, this, this..</p><p>The protective nature of the infernal lineage had once again refreshed his understanding.</p><p>Immediately grabbing the last two elixirs, Xu Xiaoshou asked curiously, “Grandmaster treated you so well, why did you break up with him?”</p><p>“Slap.”</p><p>Elder sang slapped him again, and then touched his hand as if he still wanted more. It seemed that he would not be able to get a shot soon. “Don’t ask what you shouldn’t ask.”</p><p>“Oh, OH.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his head. Actually, with his reaction, elder Sang’s little illusion wouldn’t be able to hit him at all.</p><p>But surprisingly, he didn’t want to hide either. His inner thoughts were actually the same as elder Sang’s.</p><p>After these few slaps, he reckoned that it would be difficult to get beaten again in the future.</p><p>“Is there anything else you want me to entrust you with?”After thinking for a while, Xu Xiaoshou asked, “You can also write a will or something like that. If you still have any unfinished wishes…”</p><p>“Slap.”</p><p>Elder sang slapped him again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held his head and chuckled.</p><p>After elder sang finished filming and saw his disciple (apprentice) giggling like this, he was actually amused and also giggled.</p><p>The master and disciple pair looked at each other and giggled in the higher void (level) fantasy realm that had no time to pass. The scene was simply too strange.</p><p>As he laughed, Xu Xiaoshou’s voice suddenly stopped. His nose was sore and he could not laugh anymore.</p><p>This was because the current elder sang really looked like he was in his twilight years.</p><p>His figure started to become illusory, and he was on the verge of dispersing.</p><p>Even the higher void (level) started to crack, and it was gradually crumbling.</p><p>“Hehe…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed dryly twice more.</p><p>He clearly had a lot of things he wanted to say, but he did not know where to begin.</p><p>“Hehe…”</p><p>Elder sang was also sneakily smiling. This scene suddenly reminded him of the awkwardness he felt when he was teaching Xu Xiaoshou in the spiritual library division about conducting alchemy when the fire seed shot into his nostrils.</p><p>He did not smile anymore.</p><p>After they finished discussing official business, the two of them faced each other without saying anything. They both wanted to say something, but they hesitated.</p><p>This was the first time Xu Xiaoshou had acknowledged a master.</p><p>In the past, he did not have any relatives, so he did not know how to start a conversation with his family after not seeing them for a long time. Other than discussing official business, he did not know how to start another topic.</p><p>For example, how was your life in prison? Did the people of the Holy Divine Palace mistreat you? What was your food like..</p><p>It was not elder Sang’s first time taking in a disciple, but Xu Xiaoshou was the only disciple (apprentice) who survived.</p><p>He also did not know how to have a real conversation with his disciple (apprentice) in this last meeting, other than conducting alchemy and fighting.</p><p>For example, you haven’t told me the story of the white cave yet. You should be in Dongtianwang city right now. What’s the specific situation? It’s so lively outside the spirit palace. Have you found your little girlfriend and so on..</p><p>The world suddenly shattered with a bang.</p><p>At this time, elder sang and Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have thought of something at the same time. They spoke at the same time:</p><p>“Oh right, your junior sister…”</p><p>“Yes, Mu Zixi, she…”</p><p>The two spoke at the same time and stopped at the same time. They looked at each other and smiled.</p><p>They smiled.</p><p>They laughed loudly.</p><p>When their figures disappeared, elder sang waved his hand as if he had fulfilled all his wishes. He said indifferently,</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, take good care of your junior sister. These three things are for you to use to protect your junior sister.”</p><p>“Then, remember the last words I said to you in the Eighth Palace.”</p><p>“If I die, you don’t have to fear anyone in this continent!”</p><p>“If something happens, ask Long Rongzhi (molten dragon) to help you solve it!”</p><p>“And…”</p><p>The lower half of his body was already gone, but the damn old man spoke faster and faster. It was as if he only began to speak at this time:</p><p>“Also, don’t blindly worship Bazhun’an Xin. In this world, the only person you can trust is yourself.”</p><p>“Don’t give up on conducting alchemy. The Way of the sword is trash. Don’t believe his nonsense.”</p><p>“Ember of the Infernal Heavens, cultivate well. It can become a Saint!”</p><p>“And, and…”</p><p>At the end, elder sang suddenly became more and more anxious.</p><p>“Damn Old Man!”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly interrupted him.</p><p>His nose was sore, his eyes were slightly red, and the mist was dense. He did not expect that at the last moment, he would still be touched by this old man’s words.</p><p>Then, he pulled out hidden bitter and swore his will with this sword.</p><p>White flame burst out from his body, as if elder Sang’s godhood of flame had been reborn.</p><p>White flame spread along his right arm to hidden bitter. Then, Xu Xiaoshou pointed his black sword against the sky and roared at the old man with only an illusory head image:</p><p>“Damn old man, wait for me!”</p><p>“When I ascend to the throne, I will dare to bring my sword up to the Sacred Mountain and save you from the sea of bitterness. I will flip over that broken chess game and teach that damned AI Cangsheng a new life!”</p><p>With a boom, the higher void (level) world shattered.</p><p>Elder sang’s figure completely disappeared.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou could clearly see Elder sang’s Phantom, who had been forced to speak in the end but had held back because of his words. He put all the words he had said into the last word and nodded with a smile.</p><p>“Okay..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
