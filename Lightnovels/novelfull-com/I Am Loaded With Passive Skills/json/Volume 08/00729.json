It was obvious that he did not care about Xu Xiaoshou’s indiscretion. He only made it clear.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickly gathered his thoughts and returned to the main topic. “Now that the defense has been transferred to the Imperial City, the Yunlun mountain range will definitely be empty. Isn’t Abyss Island going to descend on the Yunlun mountain range? This is an opportunity!”</p><p>Bazhun’an asked, “Who told you that Abyss Island is going to descend on Yunlun Mountain Range?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. “It’s not going to?”.</p><p>“It’s hard to say. Until that moment, even I don’t know where Abyss Island will end up,” Bazhun’an said.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was puzzled. “Then why did the Holy Divine Palace go through so much trouble to set up the defense on the Yunlun Mountain Range?”</p><p>Bazhun’an answered, “It’s just that the possibility of Abyss Island descending on Yunlun Mountain range is higher.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou kept quiet.</p><p>He hesitated for a long time before asking constructively, “Then you should take advantage of this critical moment. There would be no one in the Yunlun Mountain Range, and you can directly summon Abyss Island to that place. Won’t the matter be settled once and for all?”</p><p>Bazhun’an: “Do you think I’m a God?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou:”…”</p><p>Aren’t you?</p><p>Haven’t you always acted as if you were omnipotent?</p><p>Are you saying that you can’t do it now?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou began to question and the conversation between the two began to speed up.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou asked, “Don’t the black and white vines respect you?”</p><p>Bazhun’an replied, “But Abyss Island doesn’t respect me.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: “Then what are you waiting for? Where’s your backup plan? You’ve been lying low for a long time. You won’t let go of such a good opportunity, right?”</p><p>Bazhun’an asked, “Backup plan? What backup plan? Who told you that I have a backup plan?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.”???”</p><p>For a moment, he was shocked.</p><p>He was so shocked that he felt like he was a celestial being.</p><p>The Holy Divine Palace had already created such a grand scene. Yet, Bazhun’an, you did not even prepare anything?</p><p>Shaking his head, Xu Xiaoshou expressed his disbelief.</p><p>He felt that Bazhun’an did not trust him and did not want to tell him any of his plans.</p><p>He asked again, “What am I here for if you don’t have a backup plan? Isn’t it one of your backup plans that you asked me to come to the Imperial City?”</p><p>Bazhun’an’s tone was still a little mocking and funny from the beginning to the end. It was as if Xu Xiaoshou’s every word had hit him in an unexpected spot. He said,</p><p>“You really misunderstood.”</p><p>“I sent you to the imperial city to create some opportunities for chaos. It’s good if there are, but it’s better if there aren’t.”</p><p>“But it doesn’t matter if there are or not. The old saying is true. When the boat gets to the bridgehead, it will naturally straighten itself out..”</p><p>“When Abyss Island descends, I will come out. It’s as simple as that.”</p><p>“As for other times…”</p><p>Bazhun’an paused. “We can only wait.”</p><p>Wait?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was once again defeated.</p><p>Wait for your death!</p><p>The Holy Divine Palace laid out such a scene, yet you didn’t prepare anything. You are just going to wait and stare?</p><p>For a moment, Xu Xiaoshou sighed helplessly. “Did anyone mention to you that they don’t want to stay in the saint servant anymore?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Bazhun’an knew that Xu Xiaoshou always had a rebellious heart.</p><p>He really admired this aspect of him and didn’t mind it at all.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou ridiculed him boldly, “Perhaps you should pay attention to the hearts of your subordinates. Perhaps they don’t mean what they say. After all, it’s very difficult for people to deal with someone like you who has such confidence…”</p><p>“You don’t have confidence?”</p><p>At this moment, Bazhun’an was rather surprised. Then, he said seriously, “The word ‘Bazhun’an’ isn’t enough to give you confidence?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was at a loss for words.</p><p>What great confidence!</p><p>The calm and serious words from the communication bead left him speechless for a moment.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not afraid of deliberately forcing himself to be pretentious.</p><p>This was because usually during such a time, as long as he, Xu Xiaoshou, spoke, the other party’s power would definitely be completely broken.</p><p>However, Bazhun’an had inadvertently revealed his domineering aura. Combined with the legends that had been passed down in the past…</p><p>He completely gave people the feeling that he was merely stating a basic truth.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was convinced.</p><p>He took a deep breath and did not intend to continue his fearless entanglement with Bazhun’an. He only said, “I have a small favor that I might need your help with.”</p><p>“Speak!” Bazhun’an’s smile grew wider.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed. “As I said before, I might have to trouble you to move your butt and go to the Yunlun mountain range. You can gather the information of Abyss Island and release them to let the people of the Holy Divine Palace know.”</p><p>“A diversion?” Bazhun’an asked.</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou finally found some confidence. This guy was uncultured. He immediately refuted, “This is called besieging the Wei to save the Zhao, not a diversion!”</p><p>“Okay.” Bazhun’an agreed. “Is there anything else?”</p><p>Okay?</p><p>The other side agreed so quickly and did not even retort. Xu Xiaoshou was stunned instead.</p><p>That’s it?</p><p>With a thought, Xu Xiaoshou immediately reacted.</p><p>So you actually understood what I said just now, but just because I did not add “I need help” in front of it, you turned a deaf ear to it?</p><p>“I…”</p><p>At that moment, Xu Xiaoshou was going crazy in his heart.</p><p>Bazhun’an was determined to make Xu Xiaoshou owe him this favor and not give him the mentality of “I have an opportunity for you” to start the pace of the conversation.</p><p>This guy actually knew everything!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gritted his teeth and admitted, “In that case, help me to the end… we might need someone to help us at the trade fair. If you send over ten people at their cutting path stage, we should be able to solve the problem.”</p><p>“Okay,” Bazhun’an agreed.</p><p>“Okay?” Xu Xiaoshou was shocked again and said suspiciously, “Can you really send over ten cutting paths? If that’s the case, it’s not bad for you to add two or three higher void levels…”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“Okay?” Xu Xiaoshou was shocked again. If he could add two or three higher void levels, “Then, what about demi-saint?”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou reacted and was furious. “You’re bluffing!”</p><p>Bazhun’an retorted, “Since you’re already dreaming, what reason do I have to wake you up? At this time, it’s indeed normal for a person to sleep. What you were dreaming about was not a daydream, it was a very normal dream.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>Some curse words suddenly flashed through his mind, and then suddenly, he was startled to realize that he had actually regressed into his junior sister. He immediately threw these unrealistic and inappropriate curses to the back of his mind.</p><p>“Let’s get back to business!”</p><p>Thinking of his junior sister, Xu Xiaoshou asked seriously, “How much do you know about the organization ‘Yama’? If my guess is correct, they want to snatch the Lei Family’s Eyes.”</p><p>“Indeed.”</p><p>Bazhun’an agreed and said, “Yama, I have been watching them for a long time, but now is not the time to fight with them. You should try to stay away from them. Don’t pay attention to them for now.”</p><p>Fight…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately understood the words Bazhun’an used when he heard them.</p><p>Yama was probably even more terrifying than he had imagined.</p><p>He hesitated for a moment before saying, “I don’t want to cause any trouble, but they have already come looking for me.”</p><p>Bazhun’an was surprised. “Looking for you?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded. “Not only did they look for me, they even fought with me. They wanted to snatch my… uh, yes, it was nothing much, just a fight.”</p><p>The other side of the communication bead fell silent again.</p><p>After a long while, a voice came out. “Do you have the Lei Family’s Eyes?”</p><p>“No,” Xu Xiaoshou denied.</p><p>“If you didn’t have them, they wouldn’t have come to find you,” Bazhun’an said.</p><p>“My junior sister does have one. You should be able to tell.”</p><p>“Then they should be looking for your junior sister.”</p><p>“Okay! I admit it. I do have one…” Xu Xiaoshou gave up struggling. “But I stole this eye from the Jiang clan. It’s not from the Lei Family. Its origin was very legitimate.”</p><p>Bazhun’an was silent for a while, then he suddenly asked, “The Jiang clan of demi-saint, how did you manage to snatch something from them?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou replied, “You don’t need to know that!”</p><p>Bazhun’an paused for a moment, then he suddenly realized something. “No wonder that the storyteller didn’t even know that I had entered the city. How did a faction know that I had arrived? They even started spreading rumors. It turns out that you were the one who leaked the divine secrets…”</p><p>“You pretended to be me?”</p><p>Bazhun’an’s thinking speed was so fast that Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded on the spot.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou heard this, his lips quivered a few times. He moved the communication bead away and spat twice, ending the possible stuttering situation in advance.</p><p>Then, he moved the communication bead back and calmly replied, “That did not happen. Don’t talk nonsense.”</p><p>Bazhun’an replied, “The sound effect of the communication bead is not as bad as you think.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stayed quiet.</p><p>Damn it!</p><p>This perverted brain-speed monster, other than his body looking rather weak, how come he didn’t have any flaws at all?</p><p>I curse you, old masked man, for your thinking to become as weak as your body. Giving birth…</p><p>“Hu!”</p><p>He was suddenly jolted awake.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately shook his head and fiercely shook off the thoughts that looked like they were possessed by his junior sister.</p><p>He held the communication bead, wanting to use force, but he didn’t dare.</p><p>“Your stupid command token was useless!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chose to change the topic and talked about Bazhun’an’s command token, “I met a masked man from Yama and thought that Yama is considered a big faction and should meet your standard of deterrence. However, when I took out the command token, the other party attacked even more ruthlessly.”</p><p>“What happened in the end?” Bazhun’an asked.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou answered, “I attacked even more ruthlessly and crippled him. Then, a golden masked man came out. With the power of time, I suspect that he is Yama’s boss.”</p><p>Bazhun’an was surprised. “You fought a Sovereign?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew what he was thinking and explained, “It wasn’t a one-on-one fight either. It was just that I had all my trump cards and caught him off guard.”</p><p>If he didn’t have the buffer time brought by Aje’s confrontation with the other party, Xu Xiaoshou estimated that he had long been defeated by the purple masked man.</p><p>Bazhun’an thought for a while and said, “Then you really met someone who didn’t know any better. It should be a young person from Yama.”</p><p>“You said that the golden-masked man who appeared at the end was Huang Quan. He is indeed their leader.”</p><p>“If you meet them again in the future, you don’t have to do anything to them should their level be that high. Throw the eight-word token in front of them, draw a line between them and leave on the spot. They don’t dare to chase after you.”</p><p>Bazhun’an’s voice was firm.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked when he heard it.</p><p>Why is he so confident…</p><p>“If he chases after me?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>Bazhun’an’s tone was full of certainty. “He doesn’t dare, so there isn’t an ‘if’.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: “…”</p><p>He was really convinced!</p><p>The Eighth Sword Deity was indeed worthy of being the most arrogant and despotic person in the legends of the previous era.</p><p>Such words were said lightly, yet he almost brainwashed Xu Xiaoshou on the spot.</p><p>“Let’s not talk about Yama for now.”</p><p>Bazhun’an didn’t want to talk about it anymore and said, “I will give you the help you want later. If there’s nothing else, Let’s leave it at that for now. If there are no world-changing events, you don’t have to look for me.”</p><p>Hearing that the other party was going to hang up, Xu Xiaoshou said, “Wait!”</p><p>“There’s still a problem?” Bazhun’an asked.</p><p>“It’s not considered a problem!” Xu Xiaoshou pondered, and the old man wearing the straw hat appeared in his mind. He asked, “I just want to know about how my master is now…”</p><p>“Not dead.”</p><p>Not dead?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was first surprised, then he recalled this indifferent tone and asked, “Not dead, what do you mean by that?”</p><p>Bazhun’an replied, “It means that other than not being dead, he has already experienced everything else.”</p><p>“What are those other things…”</p><p>“Beep!”</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, the other party had already ended the communication.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou froze in the rainy street, his eyebrows twitching.</p><p>He swore that when he becomes powerful, he would hang this person up and beat him!</p><p>“Not dead…”</p><p>He took back the communication bead.</p><p>Looking at the long street that had been emptied because of the rain, Xu Xiaoshou thought about these two words carefully.</p><p>The only thing he knew about Elder Sang was that he had been captured by the Holy Divine Palace and was now imprisoned in the prison of the Holy Divine Palace of the Central Region.</p><p>And regarding the prison…</p><p>The words, “not dead”, that Bazhun’an mentioned should mean that he had gone through all the torture, all except for death…</p><p>The rain hit his face, and the long street was slightly cold.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned and stood there for a long time, not knowing what time it was.</p><p>It wasn’t until someone on the side seemed to be shouting at him to hurry home in the rain that he snapped out of his godhood.</p><p>Goose Lake, fire seed…</p><p>Conducting alchemy, burning the Spiritual Library Division…</p><p>Seeds on All Five Fingers, nostrils…</p><p>Dragon Melting Realm, burning a hundred thousand mountains…</p><p>Evil Sin Bow, blocking arrows…</p><p>Too many!</p><p>From feeding the fire seed to blocking arrows.</p><p>To put it bluntly, in less than a few months, there were so many memories in between.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought about it carefully and felt it was a little funny.</p><p>Finally, the memories returned to his eyes, and he shrugged indifferently. He pulled the corners of his mouth and did it again. Finally, after he finished pulling the corners of his mouth and gave a dry laugh, he said in a low voice,</p><p>“Retribution…”</p><p>With that said.</p><p>He took out the straw hat from his ring and put it on.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved at the person who reminded him not far away and walked forward without turning his head back.</p><p>Step by step.</p><p>His face gradually began to age.</p><p>His clothes began to be tattered, and his shoes were also charred…</p><p>On a rainy night on the long street, that thin figure seemed to be even thinner and more haggard, adding a bit of the smell of a withered old man.</p><p>The young aura completely disappeared.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have become another person.</p><p>He contacted Bazhun’an and asked Bazhun’an to besiege Wei and save Zhao, but he could not stop himself.</p><p>Since there happened to be so many events tonight.</p><p>And coincidentally, everyone loved to join in the fun.</p><p>Then how could he, Xu Xiaoshou, be absent?</p><p>Elder Sang’s matter was too far away.</p><p>The Saint Servant’s participation in the battle was also the Saint Servant’s own matter.</p><p>He, Xu Xiaoshou, had even more things to do and was waiting in the road ahead.</p><p>So…</p><p>“It’s time to get down to business!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
