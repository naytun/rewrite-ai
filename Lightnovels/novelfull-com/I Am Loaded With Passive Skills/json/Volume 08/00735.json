The tip of the vicious sword in his hand was only a few inches away from Yin Cao.</p><p>Yin Cao’s pupils constricted.</p><p>It was just his assumption. Yet, this person was really holding the Fourth Sword above his head.</p><p>All of this was just as Lord Huang Quan predicted…</p><p>But now that Xu Xiaoshou showed himself so calmly, Yin Cao could not help but feel impressed with his confidence.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, according to information, was indeed an Innate!</p><p>Innate level with Sword Finger at Cutting Path level.</p><p>Where did this guy get the confidence to show himself directly?</p><p>“I’m not mad.”</p><p>Yin Cao said indifferently, looking straight ahead. “But I can see that you’re somewhat moved. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have shown yourself in front of me.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t tell the truth that Vanishing Technique was losing effectiveness. Thus, he was just catching his breath.</p><p>He heaved a sigh and said, “If you aren’t mad, then Lord Huang Quan must be mad.”</p><p>Yin Cao was slightly stunned.</p><p>Then, he lowered his head.</p><p>“Are you awake?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked down and saw that Hundred Ghost Night Walk who was in Yin Cao’s arms had regained consciousness under the restoration of spiritual source.</p><p>Of course, he knew this fake Lei Shuangxing had long woken up. Everything was just an act.</p><p>If he really stabbed Yin Cao’s head with his sword, what he would have to face next would be the Hundred Ghost’s revenge.</p><p>“Are you gonna stop faking death now?” Xu Xiaoshou looked at Hundred Ghost.</p><p>“You’re quite smart…”</p><p>Hundred Ghost could not help but laugh. As a Cutting Path, he did not understand how he was discovered when all his energy movement was cut off.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou was a Saint Servant’s inhuman.</p><p>Although he was not very famous at this time, his battle record was already quite outstanding.</p><p>Hundred Ghosts Night Walk did not look down on him. Instead, he calmly took out a sound recording bead and injected spiritual source into it.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I am now sincerely inviting you.”</p><p>“Do you want to join Yama?”</p><p>It was the exact same tone and the exact same statement.</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou was convinced.</p><p>Yama really wanted him, Yin Cao wasn’t lying.</p><p>“Am I that outstanding?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou jumped to the ground with a smile. In his “Perception”, he knew that he was still in the enemy’s bounded domain. He couldn’t escape at all.</p><p>However, these two enemies actually became more interesting now.</p><p>“Yes!” Yin Cao nodded heavily. “You are very strong and you have very great potential. Not only Lord Huang Quan, even I myself think of you differently now…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou directly interrupted, “There’s no need to flatter me. As a Cutting Path, aren’t you ashamed to flatter me?”</p><p>The corner of Yin Cao’s mouth twitched.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took two steps back and held the vicious sword horizontally. He frowned and said, “What benefits do I get if I join Yama?”</p><p>“There are too many benefits!”</p><p>Yin Cao heard this and immediately pointed at Jiang Xian. He said, “First of all, Lord Huang Quan l said that if you want the Three Loathsome Eyes, you can have both of them directly. Besides, Lord Huang Quan can get you anything else you want.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou asked, “How about the Flower Fairy Eyes?”</p><p>Yin Cao didn’t hesitate at all and replied, “Regardless it’s the Flower Fairy Eyes or the Cross-shaped Eyes, whichever you want, you can have all of them!”</p><p>What?</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>Were these people really mad?</p><p>He was going to dig out their eyes, how could they offer on their own?</p><p>“Do you think I’m joking?”</p><p>Seeing that Xu Xiaoshou didn’t believe him, Yin Cao added, “To tell you the truth, in Lord Huang Quan’s eyes, your value is greater than the Flower Fairy Eyes and the Cross-shaped Eyes combined.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fell silent, after a long while, he said, “So this is how Yama works… Does that mean that in the future, if somebody who is more talented than me wants to join Yama, he can take anything from me, including my life?”</p><p>“Ugh!” This time, both Yin Cao and the Hundred Ghost Night Walk were choked.</p><p>What on earth was that?</p><p>They were showing the determination and sincerity of Yama to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>How could he think of it sideways and go off-track?</p><p>But after a moment, all of them immediately reacted. Huang Quan waved his hand and said, “It’s not the case…”</p><p>“There’s no need to say more!” Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand and interrupted him again.</p><p>He didn’t want to join Yama at all.</p><p>If the Great Path Oath didn’t exist in this world, he didn’t mind joining the Holy Divine Palace, Red-clothed, Saint Servant, Xu Yue Grey Palace, Yama, and so on.</p><p>Wandering around in various organizations and having all sorts of information, wouldn’t that be wonderful?</p><p>But was this world so simple?</p><p>Were all the leaders of major factions fools? Could they tolerate such behavior?</p><p>Speaking of joining the Xu Yue Grey Palace alone, it required one to sign a contract with the Ghost Beast.</p><p>Joining the red-clothed would require him to go against the Ghost Beast. He would also have to go on missions everywhere.</p><p>The leaders of major factions were all world-class experts, how could Xu Xiaoshou play with his life and act this way?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou joined the Saint Servant because their purpose was very much in line with his thoughts.</p><p>Bazhun’an gave him the greatest authority, and he could obtain “Freedom of movement” in the narrow sense.</p><p>Was it possible for other factions to do so?</p><p>Not to mention anything else.</p><p>Once he joined Yama, he would be equipped with the Lei Family’s Eyes.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not feel that he had obtained a stronger ability. He only felt that he was tied to a meaningless cause and effect.</p><p>Borrowing external forces was merely overdrawing the future.</p><p>One day, these debts would need to be repaid at an even greater price!</p><p>Using the communication bead to mobilize Bazhun’an’s assistance and owing such a huge favor was already very awkward for Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>At this moment, how could he join another faction?</p><p>“Don’t waste your breath…” Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand. “Open the bounded domain and let me go. I will let go of today’s matter.”</p><p>Yin Cao and Hundred Ghost Night Walk were speechless.</p><p>Both of them were stunned at the same time. After a while, Yin Cao said, “You took the Three Loathsome Eyes, do you want us to have a dispute over this?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sneered. “You two, one of you is a Storyteller while the other is a fake Lei Shuangxing. You attacked the Demi-Saint faction and go against the Saint Servant. I was being good enough that I let you go. Do you really think that I wouldn’t stab you with the Fourth Sword?”</p><p>As he spoke, he mentioned the Fourth Sword.</p><p>However, he was like a baby holding a knife as he threatened two great Cutting Path experts in front of him.</p><p>Yin Cao laughed loudly, “Xu Xiaoshou, you stole one of the Three Loathsome Eyes. Do you think you can be an outsider and stay out of this?”</p><p>“This is not stealing, this is collecting interest…” Xu Xiaoshou said earnestly, “The two of you pretended to be the Saint Servant, so it’s fair for me to take one of the Three Loathsome Eyes. Let’s put it another way!”</p><p>He paused for a moment and reached out his hand, “Give me the other Three Loathsome Eyes, and I will admit that it was the Saint Servant who did it today instead of Yama. I will pretend that you never came.”</p><p>Yin Cao and Hundred Ghost Night Walk were left speechless.</p><p>He was trying to take advantage…</p><p>At that moment, they really could not tell if Xu Xiaoshou was stupid or if he took both of them as fools!</p><p>“Do you really think that you can escape unscathed?” Hundred Ghost Night Walk’s voice sank.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at him and said in amusement, “What, you can’t recruit me, so are you trying to silence me now?”</p><p>“Yes!” Hundred Ghost Night Walk nodded.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed, but he was not afraid. Instead, he put away his sword and stood on the side, “Why not you try?”</p><p>“I’ll try…”</p><p>Hundred Ghost Night Walk was not done yet.</p><p>At this moment, an angry roar came from outside the Heaven Prayer Forest.</p><p>“Who dares to insult the Jiang clan?”</p><p>The roar was full of confidence.</p><p>Wherever the sound wave passed, the Heaven Prayer Forest seemed to be swept by a hurricane. Dust flew everywhere, and old trees were uprooted.</p><p>Yin Cao and Hundred Ghost Night Walk looked at each other and understood that it was the Jiang clan’s guard of Cutting Path.</p><p>He probably sensed the movement here when Yin Cao withdrew the Heaven Prayer Forest’s fantasy realm and went all out to deal with the Demi-Saint bloodline imprints.</p><p>It was only for a moment that the Heaven Prayer Forest was out of Yama’s control.</p><p>The Jiang clan’s Cutting Path was probably not the only one in that short moment.</p><p>Even the red-clothed, white-clothed, and other masters at the trade fair could sense Heaven Prayer Forest’s holy power.</p><p>It wasn’t surprising that he came.</p><p>“Cutting Path and Calamity Power!”</p><p>Yin Cao sensed the newcomer and stood up first, followed by Hundred Ghost Night Walk.</p><p>The two looked at Xu Xiaoshou, but they couldn’t figure it out.</p><p>The Jiang clan and Xu Xiaoshou weren’t allies, so the newcomer was obviously not this guy’s trump card.</p><p>Then, where did his confidence come from?</p><p>But now was obviously not the time to think about this. They would not be able to take him down in a short time. Yama did not want to clash head-on with the Jiang clan’s Cutting Path after they obtained the Three Loathsome Eyes.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Yin Cao gritted his teeth, obviously intending to give up the other Three Loathsome Eyes in Xu Xiaoshou’s hand.</p><p>This Innate expert was not an Innate as he seemed at all.</p><p>Lord Huang Quan had instructed that if they met Xu Xiaoshou, failed to recruit him and couldn’t kill him on the spot, they should treat him as a peer.</p><p>After all, this young man’s cultivation level was low.</p><p>However, his ability to save his life and stall for time was stronger than an ordinary Sovereign or Cutting Path.</p><p>The two of them shook their bodies at the same time.</p><p>However, just as they wanted to escape, they got stuck on the spot.</p><p>“Eh?” Yin Cao raised his eyebrows, “Why can’t we move?”</p><p>“Were the space order and the order of the heavens in this place changed?” Hundred Ghost Night Walk was also shocked.</p><p>They were the Cutting Path.</p><p>Who could change the space order of this place within their bounded domain and the Flower Fairy Eyes without anyone noticing?</p><p>In other words…</p><p>Did someone imprison them, two Cutting Path experts in his bounded domain?</p><p>This was impossible!</p><p>“Was it the Jiang clan’s Cutting Path?” Yin Cao’s heart skipped a beat, but he didn’t think it was possible.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a figure suddenly appeared in front of everyone’s eyes.</p><p>It was a white-haired elder with a man and a woman in each of his hands.</p><p>As soon as he landed on the ground, his gaze fell on Jiang Xian who was unconscious on the ground.</p><p>“Young Master Jiang?”</p><p>The elder was stunned for a moment before his eyes turned red with his hair stood on end. “The Three Loathsome Eyes are gone?”</p><p>“Young Master Jiang…”</p><p>Jiang Qi and Jiang Si, who had been rescued but had lost their mobility, stared at the blood-soaked figure on the ground in shock at the same time.</p><p>It had only been a few breaths of time.</p><p>How did the battle end?</p><p>Young Master Jiang’s Three Loathsome Eyes had also been taken away!</p><p>This time, the two of them felt their scalps go numb, as if they could see the tragic end of their lives.</p><p>The Jiang clan’s Cutting Path guard, Jiang Chaotian, who had rushed into the Heaven Prayer Forest recklessly also seemed to see the great end of his life at this moment.</p><p>He looked around and focused on the only two men in the arena.</p><p>“Did you do this?”</p><p>Jiang Chaotian’s voice sank to the bottom of the valley. It was so cold that it seemed as if he had emerged from hell.</p><p>How could these two Cutting Path who had not even passed the first tribulation of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity, possibly take away the Three Loathsome Eyes?</p><p>At this moment, Yin Cao and the Hundred Ghost Night Walk were anxious.</p><p>The two of them had never thought someone would imprison this space under such a drastic turn of events.</p><p>They could tell from Jiang Chaotian’s reaction that the situation in the arena was not the work of the elders in front of them.</p><p>So, the person hiding in the dark was a Higher Void?</p><p>“Say it!”</p><p>Jiang Chao Tian was roaring furiously. Spiritual source that was filled with calamity power surged vigorously, as if the god of war had descended from the sky.</p><p>The Yama duo remained silent as they frantically tried out all sorts of methods.</p><p>However, the space here was completely locked. It was as if they had entered another world. The two of them could not escape at all.</p><p>“Saint Servant?”Jiang Chaotian’s eyes almost popped out when he saw the two of them ignoring him.</p><p>However, with his last bit of rationality, he knew that this was not a Saint Servant, but an imitator with great resemblance.</p><p>It was obvious that this person wanted to frame the Saint Servant.</p><p>A diversion?</p><p>“Who are you people?” Jiang Chaotian was furious.</p><p>However, he had to figure out the identity of the person in front of him.</p><p>At the same time, as he asked, he put down Jiang Qi and Jiang Si, grabbed Jiang Xian in a flash, and started to rescue him as if he was trying the final attempt.</p><p>Yin Cao was annoyed. He could not help but get angry. He roared, “Stop shouting. You’re trapped, idiot!”</p><p>Jiang Chaotian’s movements froze.</p><p>After sensing for a while, he realized that this place wasn’t the Heaven Prayer Forest, but another dimension.</p><p>Outside the boundary of the Heaven Prayer Forest which his spiritual senses could see, it was like the end of the world. There was only chaos with nothing else.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Was there someone else at the scene?</p><p>…</p><p>In his invisible state, Xu Xiaoshou was amused by the conversation between the three great Cutting Path experts.</p><p>He had already noticed the situation.</p><p>This familiar feeling of being imprisoned. Ever since the Information Bar popped “Being watched”and “Being imprisoned”, he knew that the backups he had called were here.</p><p>After all, the scene in front of him.</p><p>Wasn’t it similar to the Spirit Fusion Swamp space that he and the grey mist figure had broken through, and the Lijian Grassland that red-clothed had broken through?</p><p>The Storyteller was indeed powerful!</p><p>“Hehehe.”</p><p>As he thought of this.</p><p>The three great Cutting Path lost their words and frantically tried to save themselves. At the same time, a delicate laughter drifted down from the sky.</p><p>“Who else could it be?”</p><p>“So, nowadays, Big Brother have the appearance of a human, and so do I?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
