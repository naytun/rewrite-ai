Quickly Invite Master Siren!</p><p><strong>Translator:</strong> Nyoi-Bo Studio <strong>Editor:</strong></p><p>Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“Young Master Xu! You’ve come out of seclusion!”</p><p>Xin Gugu immediately noticed when Xu Xiaoshou pushed open the door, appearing before the young man in a flurry of robes, astonished. He had been downstairs manning the front of the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had spent two days in seclusion, leaving them without anything to do. It made them uncomfortable.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng, on the other hand, had a rare two days of good sleep. He felt that Young Master Xu had finally learnt what it meant to be ‘quiet’.</p><p>Contrary to Xiao Wanfeng’s belief, Xin Gugu and the others knew why the Young Master entered seclusion.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was one of the main characters in the battle of the imperial city. After drinking Holy Blood and opening the Holy Statue, there was no telling how severe the after-effects would be.</p><p>As for the main character in question, Xu Xiaoshou thought he would miss the Imperial City Trial upon entering seclusion to recover.</p><p>Who would have thought that in just two days, he would return to peak condition, his body overflowing with tenacious vitality?</p><p>“Why does it feel like you’ve grown in strength again?” Xin Gugu muttered, sizing up Xu Xiaoshou with suspicious eyes.</p><p>It was just his intuition.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou resembled a mortal, mundane and unassuming with his unique breath restraining technique.</p><p>Not many people would have been able to see through the ruse as Xin Gugu had done. Judging from the aura surrounding the Young Master, he must have made a breakthrough.</p><p>An improvement in one’s cultivation was not unheard of after a difficult battle, more so for one involving those stronger than them.</p><p>“A little, but it’s better than nothing,” Xu Xiaoshou laughed.</p><p>‘Strengthen’ had levelled up, subtly altering his body structure and appearance. However, this change did not seem to affect his transformation into Xu Deye.</p><p>“You… seem to have grown taller?” Xin Gugu gestured uncertainly. He did not know if it was an illusion or if he had not noticed the Young Master’s growth before.</p><p>“Young… Young Master Xu!”</p><p>‘Mu Zixi hopped to his side from who knows where. Her big eyes shone, starry-eyed.</p><p>Xiao Qiong leaned towards him, her nose twitching uncontrollably as soon as she appeared.</p><p>“It smells good, it smells good…”</p><p>Mu Zixi eyed him doubtfully, “Did you break through again?”</p><p>“You are eyeing my life force again, aren’t you?” Xu Xiaoshou rolled his eyes as he admonished his junior sister. She was making weird gulping sounds again…</p><p>It was not an illusion! Xin Gugu’s heart trembled. He felt that Xu Xiaoshou must have made a pretty large breakthrough. Otherwise, Mu Zixi would not have noticed anything different.</p><p>“Tve been in seclusion these few days. What’s going on outside?” Taking advantage of Xiao Wanfeng’s absence, Xu Xiaoshou asked the question weighing on his mind.</p><p>“A lot has happened,” Xin Gugu replied.</p><p>Sorting through his mental list of important matters, he said, “We haven’t managed to get our hands on a jade pendant, but I know of a few people who do. It’s either that or you try your hand at the alchemy trial tomorrow… I’ve also taken the liberty of inquiring into the heaven geomantic battle. It does</p><p>not look like they’ll lift the ban.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou patted Xin Gugu’s head and gently scolded, “I’m not the kind of person who will give up easily. I’l do whatever it takes!”</p><p>Xin Gugu listened, slackjawed. He thought to himself, “But aren’t you”</p><p>“Is the Pill Refining Trial taking place tomorrow?” Xu Xiaoshou was surprised. Then again, it seemed about right as far as the time frame went.</p><p>“Yes,” Xin Gugu nodded and said, “Miss Xiaolian from the Plenty Gold Company has been looking for you these few days. She said your advice regarding Amber Juice worked very well and wanted to see you. I stopped her, however. She asked me to relay her message and said you should bring more Amber</p><p>Juice the next time; the more, the better.”</p><p>Amber Juice… Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth twitched.</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit had not been slacking off in Yuan Mansion. Amber Juice was one item he did not lack.</p><p>“What about the others? Did the Holy Divine Palace send anyone?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>All the major factions were investigated after the Spirit Gem Trade Fair ended. Those that had escaped the first round of checks would probably face scrutiny now.</p><p>“They’re here.”</p><p>At this moment, Mo Mo appeared, climbing up the stairs. Her voice was calm, “Yes, they did, but it was not anyone of great import. I spoke with quite a few of them after the trade fair ended. There are no problems on that front.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou relaxed upon hearing Mo Mo’s assurances.</p><p>Mo Mo and Xin Gugu were veterans. It was great working with competent allies.</p><p>To remain as the ghost beast host body for so many years without being caught, he had to have had some experience in prevaricating.</p><p>He suddenly thought of something and asked, “Where are the Red Coats?”</p><p>Xin Gugu shook his head. “The Red Coats aren’t around.”</p><p>“They aren’t?” Xu Xiaoshou was startled by this revelation.</p><p>The Night Guardian had been keeping a close watch on him, but he was not around at the moment. Something was not right.</p><p>Could he be preparing some big move?</p><p>Xin Gugu noticed Xu Xiaoshou’s strange expression and laughed, “Rao Yaoyao has been busy. She brought a contingent of Red Coats and White-clothed to search the Yunlun Mountain Range and set up new defences. They haven’t finished their matters yet. How could they have the time to deal with other</p><p>matters?”</p><p>“Tm different</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was suspicious.</p><p>He felt that the Night Guardian was not someone who would give up easily. No matter how busy he was, he would find time to come over since he still harboured suspicions towards this ‘Young Master Xu’.</p><p>The only explanation he could come with was Master Siren’s appearance. Perhaps, Master Siren had dealt too great of a blow to his psyche.</p><p>Yes… That had to be it!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou heaved a sigh of relief when he thought of that possibility.</p><p>Master Siren had a lofty identity, and for him to testify on his behalf was an extraordinary feat already.</p><p>It was equivalent to Rao Yaoyao stepping out to say: “Young Master Xu of the First Pavilion in the Sky is not Xu Xiaoshou. You don’t need to waste your time investigating him.”</p><p>For a Seven Sword Deity to defend the Saint Servant with their body… No matter how suspicious the Night Guardian was, he would have had no choice but to let go of the last vestiges of doubt.</p><p>“Where’s Bazhun’an?”</p><p>‘When he thought of the Yunlun Mountains, Xu Xiaoshou immediately thought of Bazhun’an. With Rao Yaoyao making a move, would this masked man fall into the net?</p><p>“Who is Bazhun’an?”</p><p>Xin Gugu and the others had questions marks floating over their heads.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was taken aback but realized that he had made a wrong assumption.</p><p>He knew why Abyss Island appeared. Xin Gugu and the others had no idea what was happening in the Yunlun Mountain Range. It could only be Bazhun’an’s doing.</p><p>Perhaps, even Rao Yaoyao did not know that Bazhun’an was the puppeteer pulling the strings.</p><p>Old Yin…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cursed in his heart and asked, “Did Rao Yaoyao get any results from searching the Yunlun Mountain Range?”</p><p>“A girlfriend with a sacred physique… I have to hurry and find one…” Xu Xiaoshou muttered in his heart. He maintained his poker face and calmly said, “Roses all have thorns. They should be admired from a distance and not toyed with at one’s leisure. It may not be a good idea to touch me.”</p><p>The three of them: “…”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, + 3.”</p><p>Xin Gugu’s hand trembled, and the wound healed. He said in surprise, “You broke through! What level are you at now?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled arrogantly, “A level where I can easily crush you.”</p><p>Xin Gugu frowned, burning with an intense fighting spirit.</p><p>How long had it been since he trained Xu Xiaoshou in Yuan Mansion? Regardless of his potential or shapeshifting abilities, there was only so much improvement a person could make in so short a span.</p><p>In just a month, he fancied himself capable of matching a Sovereign (Stage) cultivator so much that he could wipe the floor with them?</p><p>He was not an ordinary Sovereign (Stage) cultivator!</p><p>‘Mu Zixi was also deep in thought. Xu Xiaoshou had become stronger again…</p><p>After not seeing him for two days, it was like six years had passed.</p><p>He had changed again!</p><p>He had become more than a little stronger since they last met!</p><p>Looking at herself…</p><p>My senior brother is already a Master (Stage) cultivator, and I’m still only at the Innate (Stage).</p><p>“You’re useless!” Mu Zixi thought to herself.</p><p>Acharming female voice appeared in her mind with a hint of mockery. “As long as you want, you can break through to Master (Stage) now… Have you decided? Why do you resist your heart’s desire? Let me help you…”</p><p>‘Mu Zixi shook her head, causing her twin ponytails to bob. She did not respond to the voice.</p><p>With his interest piqued, Xu Xiaoshou said to Xin Gugu, “Get ready. Let’s see if you can take a punch from me. You’d better use your full strength. Otherwise, you might die.”</p><p>Xin Gugu’s eyes turned cold. This provocation came so suddenly that he almost could not suppress his bloodthirsty.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>“Come on.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his right hand.</p><p>Xin Gugu took a horse stance.</p><p>The two people on the side retreated a few steps. They knew that Xu Xiaoshou was going to test his strength. It was a common practice in the past, but it had been a long time since he had last tested it.</p><p>Blood energy surged in the arena. Xin Gugu used his full strength and shouted, “Bring it on!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not use his spiritual energy, relying solely on his body. Carefully, he adjusted his power and threw a punch using 30% of his full strength.</p><p>Xin Gugu noticed how Xu Xiaoshou held back and lowered his Qi and blood energy output to what he had used in past spars with Xu Xiaoshou. He did not want to send this whimsical fellow to his death.</p><p>In the end…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Acolumn of air exploded out of the pavilion. The shock wave erupted in a violent counter force which should have sent Xu Xiaoshou flying. Yet, he remained unmoving.</p><p>Then, a shockwave of even greater intensity swept towards Xin Gugu.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>The wind howled, and Xin Gugu vanished.</p><p>The protective barrier around the Pilgrimage Tower shattered. It was not at the same level as the Eight Trigrams Pilgrimage Map, so it could not withstand the force of the explosion.</p><p>Moreover, the blast had occurred from within the barrier and not without. The Pilgrimage Tower’s barrier was meant to defend against external forces and not attacks from the inside.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s fist sent Xin Gugu flying through partitions and walls; nothing could stop his momentum out of the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>So…</p><p>Mo Mo and Mu Zixi could see the shock written on Xin Gugu’s face. His right arm had turned into a pretzel from that one punch, but in the next second, he disappeared.</p><p>It was an afterimage!</p><p>Before they could gather their thoughts, they felt their ears ring.</p><p>“Bang, bang, bang!”</p><p>Astraight line consisting of Xin Gugu shaped impressions appeared on the walls, destroying several floors worth of cultivation rooms, and allowing the darkness outside to seep into the building.</p><p>Then…</p><p>“AH-—I”</p><p>An ear-piercing scream speaking of unimaginable pain ripped through the darkness.</p><p>Mo Mo and Mu Zixi spun around in shock.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled, blowing away the blood dripping from his fist. It was not his. The strength of his recently improved Sovereign Physique had allowed him to blow away a ghost beast host body at the Sovereign (Stage).</p><p>Facing the two shocked gazes beside him, he said indifferently, “That was about 30% of my strength.”</p><p>Mo Mo:”…”</p><p>‘Mu Zixi:</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>“Doubted, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Enemy attack!”</p><p>Asharp sound suddenly came from the main door downstairs, followed by the sound of the wooden bell and an agitated Xiao Wanfeng climbing up the stairs.</p><p>“Big Sister Mo, Great Aunt Mu, it’s bad! It’s an enemy attack!”</p><p>“I don’t know what happened, but the enemy has entered the building. I didn’t even notice… until Brother Xin blew up! Something sent him flying! What’s going on!?”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng kept saying, “Quickly go and invite Master Siren… Uh, Young Master Xu?”</p><p>Master Siren?</p><p>Why did he not journey to the west and invite the Buddha himself?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
