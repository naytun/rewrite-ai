Is the Imperial City still in danger?”</p><p>Night Guardian turned his head and stared at him for a long time.</p><p>But at this moment, no matter how much he believed that Xu Xiaoshou could cause trouble, he did not think that this was something that kid could do.</p><p>So, it was really a coincidence?</p><p>After pondering for a long time, the Night Guardian sighed, “Regarding the matter of Young Master Xu’s trial, we will temporarily put it aside. We will meet again in the future.”</p><p>After saying that, he turned around.</p><p>“Everyone, head to the Yunlun Mountain Range immediately!”</p><p>Whoosh.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not have the time to bid farewell to the other side.</p><p>The figures of the red-clothed people and the others, who were in a rush, all disappeared.</p><p>“Xu Xu, Xu, Young Master Xu, is it over?”</p><p>At this moment, Xiao Wanfeng looked at the red-clothed team that had suddenly appeared and disappeared. He was a little stammering.</p><p>At that moment, the two of them, together with a square table, were swaggering in the middle of the road after losing their bounded domain.</p><p>After the pedestrians on the road came back to their senses after being frightened by the arrival of Sky City, they couldn’t help but be surprised by the two of them.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“Setting a table and drinking tea in the middle of the day?”</p><p>“Ah! Isn’t this Young Master Xu from the First Pavilion in the Sky? He’s really in a leisurely and elegant mood… with the arrival of Sky City, is he still in the mood to drink tea?”</p><p>“Hey, Young Master Xu, Where’s Sky City? Aren’t you going to participate?”</p><p>The crowd discussed among themselves.</p><p>Some of the bold ones, who had seen Young Master Xu’s previous actions in the pilgrimage square, knew that this demi-saint’s descendant actually didn’t put on airs, so they joked on the spot.</p><p>“Sky City, I don’t have the ability to participate.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cheerfully waved his hand at the crowd, then turned around and signalled Xiao Wanfeng to put away the table.</p><p>Bazhun’an was able to pull off such a trick. It was truly a lifesaver. How could he participate in another mess?</p><p>“Abyss Island…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was thinking.</p><p>The arrival of Sky City was too sudden. He believed that everyone was unprepared.</p><p>Under such circumstances, the Holy Divine Palace, which had been set up a few months ago, was undoubtedly the biggest beneficiary.</p><p>Therefore, not only did Xu Xiaoshou not plan to participate, he even wanted to stay far away.</p><p>He did not receive any instructions about participating in the matter of the Abyss Island. The mission given by the Saint Servant was only to stir up trouble in the Dongtianwang City.</p><p>He was not in a hurry to get involved in this muddy water!</p><p>Most importantly, Xu Xiaoshou felt that even if Bazhun’an summoned the Abyss Island, he might not have the time to guide the huge city to descend into the Yunlun Mountain Range.</p><p>This was because Rao Yaoyao would definitely not give him the time.</p><p>So, in the end.</p><p>The appearance of the Abyss Island this time was just Bazhun’an trying to draw a final-stage conclusion to the matter of the Imperial city.</p><p>At the same time, the Holy Divine palace, red-clothed and white-clothed people would be transferred back to the Yunlun Mountain Range.</p><p>If someone really felt that the sacred secret land of Sky City had descended and wanted to interfere, the greater possibility would be that Rao Yaoyao and the others, who had returned to defend, would fight back and even lose their underwear.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>“Return to the First Pavilion in the Sky!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not hesitate and instantly made a decision.</p><p>His people were all in the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>If Liu Changqing could escape safely in the end, he should also return to the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>Only by returning to the headquarters, with the Eight Trigrams Pilgrimage Map, and the Mei Siren people holding down the fort would he have the confidence.</p><p>Only then could Xu Xiaoshou truly have that confidence. Even if the Night Guardian came back, no matter how suspicious he was, he would not be able to find any evidence.</p><p>…</p><p>Swish swish.</p><p>The sound of the wind echoed.</p><p>In the sky above the Imperial City, at this moment, there were too many red-clothed and white-clothed people who had given up on their own mission. They turned back and ran towards the north.</p><p>Everyone knew that the Yunlun Mountain Range was a conspiracy.</p><p>Perhaps when everyone reached that place, they would not even be able to find the culprit.</p><p>But this was something that could not be helped.</p><p>The Sky City could not appear before the Imperial City Trial.</p><p>Otherwise, the Imperial City Trial of the Eastern Sky Realm would be destroyed in an instant.</p><p>And the Imperial City Trial was related to the selection of the Holy Palace.</p><p>This was equivalent to the eastern sky realm throwing away many of the outstanding seedlings of the Holy Palace’s selection.</p><p>The various factions would not agree.</p><p>The Holy Divine Palace could not withstand such pressure either.</p><p>Therefore, in Sky City, red-clothed and white-clothed people had to stop it from falling.</p><p>In the Central Zone.</p><p>Night Guardian led a group of red-clothed people as they rushed forward.</p><p>It was precisely because of these concerns that he immediately set off to support the Yunlun Mountain Range.</p><p>But when he turned around.</p><p>To be honest, Night Guardian immediately regretted it.</p><p>Strictly speaking, he was the only one who had a 70-80% judgment on whether Young Master Xu was Xu Xiaoshou or not.</p><p>However, these were all things on the emotional level.</p><p>Even if he said it out loud, it wouldn’t be considered evidence.</p><p>And without any evidence, an ordinary person could be directly arrested and brought back to the red-clothed prison for interrogation. Demi-saint’s descendant couldn’t be touched.</p><p>Thus, he knew that the return of the Night Guardian would mean that he would miss the best opportunity to verify Xu Xiaoshou’s identity.</p><p>Perhaps, this opportunity..</p><p>Was the only one!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is not a person who will easily reveal his flaws…”</p><p>When he thought of this, the Night Guardian suddenly came to a realization.</p><p>If he let Young Master Xu return to the First Pavilion in the Sky and waited for him to reorganize his thoughts, he might not be able to find any trace of him.</p><p>The Night Guardian was also a ruthless person.</p><p>When he thought of this, he really stopped in mid-air.</p><p>“Elder?”</p><p>Red-clothed people, who was following behind him, almost bump into him, and they all cried out in surprise.</p><p>“In the Yunlun Mountain Range, I will not be the extra one nor I will be the missing one. All of you, go and support there immediately. I have other matters that I need to verify,” the Night Guardian said decisively.</p><p>“But Sword Diety Rao’s orders are to gather immediately…”</p><p>“There’s no but!”</p><p>The more Night Guardian was refuted, the clearer his thoughts became.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s matter could be said to be both small and big.</p><p>He believed that even if Rao Yaoyao were to come now, she would not understand why Night Guardian would make such a choice.</p><p>After all, it was only a junior Saint Servant and Sky City. It was easy to know which matter was bigger and more important.</p><p>However, after witnessing Xu Xiaoshou’s growth as a Night Guardian, he knew that it had only been a few months since Xu Xiaoshou’s rise.</p><p>This growth rate was too terrifying!</p><p>Back in the White Cave, this brat could only run around in a panic.</p><p>It was not yet his turn to fight in the Eighth Palace.</p><p>However, once he reached the Imperial City..</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could actually destroy the higher void (level) and blow up a city.</p><p>It had only been a month or so, right?</p><p>If he continued to indulge himself, Xu Xiaoshou’s would really come into force , and no one would be able to stop him!</p><p>“All of you go to the north. I’ll act alone.” the Night Guardian gave a serious order.</p><p>“No, elder. We know that you want to…”</p><p>“Execute!”</p><p>“… Yes!”</p><p>With a swish, the red-clothed people disappeared from behind.</p><p>Inside the red-clothed people, the orders of the higher-ups were clearly not to be disobeyed.</p><p>Night Guardian stopped in mid-air. With his perception, he sensed the figure returning to the First Pavilion in the Sky from the Central Zone. He pondered in the air for a long time.</p><p>Then, he opened his bounded domain and took off his red robe, changed into a black robe with a mask.</p><p>“Young Master Xu?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“I really don’t believe this evil!”</p><p>…</p><p>Central Zone.</p><p>The grey city covered the sun.</p><p>At this moment, the huge city in the sky was pressing down on them.</p><p>However, other than the initial panic, everyone became calm and began to live a normal life.</p><p>Because no matter how anxious they were, they couldn’t be.</p><p>The huge city was pressing down on them. Although the pressure to fall was huge, the imperial city obviously wouldn’t allow such a thing to happen.</p><p>And the descent of the Sky City also required a lot of time.</p><p>Other than waiting, the Spiritual Cultivator in the Imperial City did not have the strength to pull down the huge city above them.</p><p>Hence, even if the sky above the city covered the sun as if it was the end of the world and even the sky had collapsed.</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivator who were used to it had nothing else to do other than to maintain their daily life.</p><p>On the street, two figures were slowly walking through the crowd.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng was holding a teapot and constantly adding water to Young Master Xu’s teacup. As he added water, he was also chattering.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, look at how mysterious Sky City is. The Holy Divine Palace of the Yunlun Mountain Range has been setting up defenses for a long time. A large part of the reason is to prevent the Sky City from landing early and delaying the Imperial City Trial.”</p><p>“I think the current situation is caused by manpower.”</p><p>“Someone must have taken advantage of the fact that Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou was bombing the city last night to take over Sky City!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not reply.</p><p>He held his teacup and was deep in thought. His thoughts were obviously not on the same page as Xiao Wanfeng.</p><p>Night Guardian left.</p><p>But why did he still have a faint feeling of fear?</p><p>Was there still a crisis?</p><p>“Young Master Xu?”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng saw that Young Master Xu was silent and deep in thought. He felt that his deduction had caused Young Master Xu to fall into deep thought, so he immediately continued:</p><p>“Young master Xu, I think that even though there’s a foundational roots of Saint Ascension in Sky City, the Holy Divine Palace’s defenses are so strong. It’s obvious that it’s used to fend off enemies and keep people away.” Xiao Wanfeng said</p><p>“In other words, if the foundational roots of Saint Ascension is such a good gimmick, Sky City should be open to the public if it’s really possible to achieve the Saint Ascension. Why are you hiding it?”Xiao Wanfeng asked</p><p>“I think there’s a trap here!”</p><p>“But it’s a Saint foundational roots of Saint Ascensionafter all… Young Master Xu, are you really not going to participate?”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng subconsciously wanted to push Xu Xiaoshou’s elbow, but he did not dare to.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, on the other hand, frowned.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng’s words were getting further and further away from his ears.</p><p>The pedestrians on the street were becoming more and more illusory in his eyes.</p><p>The throbbing feeling in his heart was also getting stronger.</p><p>“Something’s happening!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t stupid.</p><p>The sudden whim of perception had saved his life many times.</p><p>In this world of Spiritual Cultivation, metaphysics needed to be believed.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t find where the crisis came from, so he panicked.</p><p>“That’s right, I’m a Master (stage) now!”</p><p>A light flashed through Xu Xiaoshou’s mind, and he calmed down.</p><p>He looked at the information bar.</p><p>“Passive Points: 1769,455.”</p><p>Originally, Xu Xiaoshou wanted to wait for the remaining one million or so to stabilize. After returning to the First Pavilion in the Sky, he would directly level up his Passive Skills.</p><p>After that, he would use the strength of the demi-saint’s descendant, Xu Deye, and the Saint Servant, Xu Xiaoshou, who had already become a Master (stage), to create an even stronger contrast, completely separating their identities.</p><p>However, at this moment, the crisis in his heart made Xu Xiaoshou feel that he couldn’t wait any longer.</p><p>“Perception!”</p><p>“Perception first!”</p><p>Without hesitation, Xu Xiaoshou used 100,000 Passive Points and directly used the Passive Skill, Perception.</p><p>He had to know where the current danger came from?</p><p>“Perception (Master (stage) Lv.1) .”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Perception (Sovereign (stage) Lv.1) .”</p><p>The Passive Skill level increased by 10 steps and reached the sovereign (stage) level.</p><p>It was completely different from the more restrained and reserved effect of “Stealth”after reaching the Sovereign (stage) .</p><p>The “Perception”of the Sovereign (stage) level magnified the scene that Xu Xiaoshou could see in his mind by 10 times.</p><p>The “Perception”of Master (stage)1 had a range of 10 miles.</p><p>Master (stage) Perception had a range of one mile at a time.</p><p>However, the moment he sat on the Sovereign (stage), a qualitative leap occurred!</p><p>At that moment, Xu Xiaoshou even felt that the world had become smaller.</p><p>His “Perception” had a range of a hundred miles!</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly understood.</p><p>Why was it that within the Sovereign (stage) level, what happened in the east of the city could be instantly detected by the Sovereign (stage) tens of miles away in the west of the city.</p><p>As for the Cutting Path (stage) , it was able to survey the entire city.</p><p>Because of the “Path”!</p><p>Yes, the “Perception”of the Sovereign (stage) level not only gave Xu Xiaoshou an increase in range.</p><p>Even the element and Order of the Path between heaven and earth were clearly presented to the main body of the “Perception”.</p><p>This was too strong!</p><p>It wasn’t just that.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could clearly see the source of the throbbing that he couldn’t find before when he placed the “Perception” point on the Sovereign (stage) level.</p><p>In the north, an unknown black shadow was hiding in the Order of the Void Path. It was holding a sword and stabbing towards the speed of light.</p><p>“Ambushed, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>Beside him, Xiao Wanfeng also inexplicably turned towards the direction of the Intangible black shadow. He could not see anything with his naked eyes, but his hair stood on end.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, be careful, there’s an assassin!”</p><p>A cry of alarm sounded out.</p><p>He pushed.</p><p>With a bang, Xiao Wanfeng felt an enormous force coming from his hand.</p><p>He was unable to push Young Master Xu, but he was instead pushed out as if he had pushed a hedgehog, and his hand was shaken and was covered in blood.</p><p>At this moment, Xiao Wanfeng was stunned.</p><p>“? ? ?”</p><p>On the other side, Xu Xiaoshou could not care about this anymore.</p><p>He was immediately confused as to who the assassin was.</p><p>However, the familiar strength of the person who came… as well as the extremely sharp mental reaction that came from reaching the Sovereign (stage) level.</p><p>This caused Xu Xiaoshou to instantly make a judgment.</p><p>“The returning Night Guardian, in the name of an assassin, wants to pierce through his own body and sense the power related to ‘Xu Xiaoshou’to verify his identity…”</p><p>“Weng –”</p><p>Hidden Bitter within the ring trembled and was about to pounce out to protect its master.</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>Aje, who was on his chest, let out a low moan and was about to punch out in morph forms.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou quickly stopped all of this.</p><p>Night Guardian was not here to kill people.</p><p>He was here to verify it one last time.</p><p>Once these things that belonged to Xu Xiaoshou appeared, he, Xu Deye, would not be able to clear his name even if he jumped into the Yellow River!</p><p>Teleportation could not be used.</p><p>The signature Vanishing Technique could not be used either.</p><p>Just as Xu Xiaoshou gritted his teeth and planned to directly strengthen his Sovereign Physique and use the defensive power of his “sacred physique” to with stand this attack.</p><p>“Clang –”</p><p>A figure suddenly descended from the sky.</p><p>Two fingers were out to block the Night Guardian’s Cutting path (stage) Sword of Darkness.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
