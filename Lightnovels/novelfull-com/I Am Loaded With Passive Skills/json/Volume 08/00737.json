Did he need to cooperate with the fake Saint Servant’s chief? What did he want?</p><p>It wasn’t to the extent that the two of them cooperated just to get that drop of Saint Blood!</p><p>Jiang Chaotian was even more terrified.</p><p>The Saint Servant’s Storyteller, one of the two people from the mysterious organizations with the Lei Family’s Eyes, was already coming aggressively.</p><p>Now, the sudden arrival of the Saint Servant’s chief had taken away his last trump card.</p><p>He was not Jiang Xian.</p><p>The Saint Blood is a life-saving trump card that can only be used once!</p><p>After throwing away the saint blood, the moment the Saint Servant’s chief with the sword cognition appeared, Jiang Chaotian immediately thought of the fear of the Jiang clan being controlled by the masked man in the Tianyang Manor.</p><p>At that time, the other party did not even need to make a move, and everyone had lost their ability to resist!</p><p>At the present moment, Xu Xiaoshou saw that everyone was giving him respect and didn’t make a move. Moreover, the passive points of ‘fear’ and ‘bewilderment’ were continuously transmitted to him. He nodded in satisfaction.</p><p>Then, he turned his head to look at Jiang Chaotian and said in a hoarse voice,</p><p>“I have something to do, so I won’t play with you guys for the time being. I also want to take the storyteller with me. You guys can settle your disputes on your own.”</p><p>“What’s worth mentioning is that I have no interest in the Three Loathsome Eyes.”</p><p>He turned to look at Jiang Qi beside him.</p><p>Jiang Qi was still in a daze.</p><p>In this situation involving cutting paths, she, a mere sovereign, wouldn’t be able to stir up any waves.</p><p>Even if she was resourceful, at this moment, what Jiang Qi could read from the muddled gaze of the Saint Servant’s chief was only a little appreciation.</p><p>Then, the crowd heard the masked man sigh.</p><p>“If I really wanted the Three Loathsome Eyes, Young Master Jiang would have already lost it…”</p><p>The Jiang clan’s trio was instantly certain.</p><p>This was the real Saint Servant’s chief!</p><p>This person was the same as the one who had gone to the Tianyang Manor as a guest!</p><p>Jiang Chaotian’s target of hatred was instantly shifted upon hearing this.</p><p>He knew that the person who wanted to snatch the Three Loathsome Eyes must be the two people under Yama.</p><p>After all, he, Jiang Chao Tian, could not even see the chief of the saint servant at the Tianyang Manor that day. He had been chased out.</p><p>However, because he also knew that the chief of the saint servant had gone to the Tianyang Manor, the other party had lost the possibility of lying about this matter.</p><p>The disdain that the chief of the saint servant said.</p><p>Should be true disdain.</p><p>“Yama…”</p><p>Hatred flashed in Jiang Chaotian’s eyes as he glanced at the other two.</p><p>At this moment, the Yama duo felt that there was nothing they can do to remove the stigma off their name.</p><p>They really only got one of the Three Loathsome Eyes!</p><p>The other one was in Xu Xiaoshou’s hands!</p><p>However, the time when the chief of the saint servant appeared here was too late.</p><p>He might not have seen it, but he could not care about the Three Loathsome Eyes.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou was very interested in it!</p><p>This kid had snatched half of the three-hatred pupil. Perhaps even the saint servant’s chief did not know about it at this moment!</p><p>However, who dared to say anything at this moment?</p><p>The fact that the Saint Servant’s chief did not bother about the Yama duo impersonating the saint servants was already a blessing.</p><p>At this moment, who would dare to say something like “You might not know, but one of the Three Loathsome Eyes is really in the hands of your saint servant’s Xu Xiaoshou” in front of someone who was comparable to Lord Huang Quan?</p><p>Who would dare?</p><p>Anyone who spoke too much would die.</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>Seeing that the arena was silent, Xu Xiaoshou only turned to look at the storyteller. “The matter at the Yunlun mountain range hasn’t been resolved yet.”</p><p>It was said to be the Yunlun mountain range.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou only cared about the trade fair.</p><p>Although the Heaven Prayer Forest’s operation didn’t take much time, every second is important now. He didn’t know how the trade fair was progressing, whether the Saint Servant’s other support was in place, and whether everyone was dead…</p><p>The illusion that shrouded the Heaven Prayer Forest was forced to be interrupted once.</p><p>The holy power leaked out.</p><p>There were definitely many people who would arrive at this place.</p><p>In short, it was not good to stay here for long.</p><p>His state of mind wandered and it took Xu Xiaoshou a long time before he reacted.</p><p>As soon as he spoke, the storyteller beside him did not respond in time.</p><p>The other party had a bitter expression on his face as if he was resisting something. Spiritual source fluctuations even appeared on his body.</p><p>Everyone noticed this transformation and immediately realized it.</p><p>Someone had arrived outside the Storyteller’s pocket dimension.</p><p>It could be said that the other party was currently attempting to break through this dimension!</p><p>“Storyteller?”</p><p>The arena’s only person who did not realize this was Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He was only at the innate stage. Even though he was knowledgeable, he was too inexperienced when it came to spatial combat techniques. He only frowned when the storyteller did not cooperate with him in time.</p><p>“It’s over…”</p><p>At this moment, the storyteller spoke.</p><p>He seemed to have an unobstructed constipation. He suddenly turned around and gave Xu Xiaoshou a bitter and dry smile.</p><p>He didn’t say anything else.</p><p>“Thud, thud, thud.”</p><p>From afar, in the Heaven Prayer Forest, the sound of footsteps could be heard.</p><p>This time, no matter how ignorant Xu Xiaoshou was, he also realized that it was the power of the world the storyteller created that was unable to resist outsiders and intruded forcibly.</p><p>“White-clothed is here?” At that moment, Xu Xiaoshou was terrified.</p><p>Everyone looked at him.</p><p>The Yama duo was also nervous.</p><p>Tonight’s matter was getting bigger and bigger. Just because of the stolen Three Loathsome Eyes, the situation started to snowball and became more and more out of control.</p><p>If white-clothed’s support arrived, the only happy person in the arena would be the real victim, the Jiang clan.</p><p>The Jiang clan’s people turned their attention to the arena.</p><p>If one were to say that they were looking forward to it..</p><p>The Jiang clan’s three people were the only ones in the arena who had a sliver of hope in their hearts.</p><p>..</p><p>“Thud, thud, thud.”</p><p>The footsteps were getting closer and closer, neither too fast nor too slow.</p><p>Along with them were some clanging sounds.</p><p>Everyone’s spiritual senses probed at the same time.</p><p>However, at this moment, even with Xu Xiaoshou’s “Perception”, when he probed the person who had come, he could only vaguely see the silhouette of a person who seemed to be covered in mosaics.</p><p>This was a big shot!</p><p>Indeed, even the storyteller was unable to resist the other party’s forceful entry.</p><p>If this person wasn’t a big shot, what else could he be?</p><p>Everyone realized this point.</p><p>The situation became tense all of a sudden.</p><p>The clanging sounds of metal colliding with each other, followed by the calm footsteps, were getting closer and closer to the ears of the people present.</p><p>“Who is it!”</p><p>Yin Cao shouted in a low voice.</p><p>He was already unable to resist the pressure and had to make a sound to destroy the accumulation of this aura.</p><p>However, the person who came was deliberately creating a sense of pressure. He did not respond at all and only continued to calmly approach step by step.</p><p>After a long while.</p><p>In the depths of the fog, an ancient figure finally walked out.</p><p>Along with it was a voice that seemed to float down from the sky. It was ethereal to the extreme and also extremely hoarse.</p><p>“I am… Bazhun’an.”</p><p>This voice was gentle, reserved, and powerful. It was calm and clear.</p><p>If it was placed in his place, it would be placed somewhere else.</p><p>This appearance, coupled with these three words…</p><p>Even if it was the higher void, it would probably shake three times!</p><p>But now…</p><p>With that famous name, a disheveled man with tattered black robes, stained with blood, and carrying a sack walked out at the right time…</p><p>Even though he only had eight fingers on his hand, and there was a scar on his neck, his eyes were cloudy, and his voice was abnormally hoarse..</p><p>…!</p><p>The entire arena fell silent.</p><p>“…”</p><p>The silence was the greatest awkwardness at this moment.</p><p>They looked at each other, and the silence was the echo of everyone in the arena.</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p>The Jiang clan, the storyteller, and even Xu Xiaoshou were all completely dumbfounded by the sudden appearance of another “Bazhun’an”.</p><p>The scruffy-looking man, who was dragging a sack and creating an atmosphere of an expert appearing in the arena, was also stunned when he entered the arena.</p><p>He looked at the masked man behind the storyteller, who was dressed in a familiar manner. His eyes instantly turned from indifferent and mysterious to dull and full of suspicion.</p><p>The entire atmosphere that he had deliberately created vanished into thin air along with the changes in his eyes.</p><p>Then.</p><p>The scruffy-looking man’s gaze moved down from the masked man’s turbid eyes as if he was confirming something.</p><p>Then, he really saw the other party’s Black Hand. It was clearly a pair of hands that only had eight fingers.</p><p>???</p><p>The scruffy-looking man’s eyebrows suddenly jumped.</p><p>His heart twitched violently. Then, his gaze swept past the masked man and landed on the storyteller in front of him.</p><p>This was a storyteller…</p><p>Scruffy-looking man was very sure!</p><p>He was very sure!</p><p>However, when he turned his head to look at the other side.</p><p>There was also a storyteller who looked like a storyteller. This storyteller was dragging the Yin Yang Life and Death Trap…</p><p>???</p><p>The corner of the scruffy-looking man’s mouth twitched as well.</p><p>He realized that his heart suddenly stopped beating.</p><p>He had just won a big victory, and he had a strong aura. He wanted to follow up his victory and continue his mission in the arena.</p><p>But the information he received didn’t seem to be like this..</p><p>How could the saint servant be here?</p><p>How could the Saint Servant’s chief be here?</p><p>How could the storyteller be here?</p><p>And there were two of them?!</p><p>This momentary daze made the scruffy-looking man feel like he was dreaming.</p><p>He closed his eyes, shook his head lightly, and opened them again.</p><p>In front of him, everyone was still in a daze.</p><p>The scene didn’t change, and the people didn’t disappear either.</p><p>???</p><p>…</p><p>Indeed.</p><p>The original Bazhun’an and everyone in this place… was as shocked as the new Bazhun’an!</p><p>The Jiang clan trio watched the uncle who called himself Bazhun’an enter the arena. Then, they stammered and looked back at the original Bazhun’an in disbelief.</p><p>???</p><p>The Yama also glanced at the Bazhun’an who looked obviously more like Bazhun’an. Then, he looked at the Bazhun’an who was originally “Bazhun’an”.</p><p>???</p><p>The storyteller covered his head and said in astonishment, “Brother, brother?”</p><p>He only knew that someone had broken through the Force of Rules of his Yin Yang Life and Death Trap, but he did not know who that person was in advance.</p><p>Because the other party..</p><p>Was a little strong!</p><p>And among the people present, there were not many who had seen the true face of the Saint Servant’s chief. The storyteller was one of them.</p><p>The reason why he would still say “Brother” in surprise and bewilderment was that this new Bazhun’an who appeared with a sack was indeed the face of his brother whom he had seen before.</p><p>It was exactly the same!</p><p>As for why his older brother had changed into a different outfit and entered with a big sack..</p><p>This was his older brother’s previous image!</p><p>He had changed back?</p><p>But, that wasn’t right!</p><p>These were his older brother’s words, the original one..</p><p>The storyteller suddenly looked at the Bazhun’an that he had thought was Xu Xiaoshou. Suddenly, he felt his head explode and his head was gone.</p><p>He could not be completely sure whether Xu Xiaoshou was still in the disappearing state or whether he had really activated his acting method again.</p><p>But now, a second brother had appeared…</p><p>The other party was still so realistic that even the intimate relationship between the storyteller and the real brother could not deny that the person was a fake from the aura, voice, image, and other aspects.</p><p>Then, did this mean that.</p><p>The brother that he thought was a fake by Xu Xiaoshou was a mistake?</p><p>The one in front of him was the real brother who had returned from the Yun Lun Mountains.</p><p>Or was it Xu Xiaoshou who was pretending to be him?</p><p>The Storyteller, who was in a daze, seemed to have forgotten an indisputable fact.</p><p>This new Bazhun’an had forcefully barged in from outside the small space world. It was impossible for him to be Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>The Bazhun’an that Xu Xiaoshou was pretending to be had already entered the scene of the society’s death.</p><p>He did not think that this was the Bazhun’an.</p><p>Because the moment the other party appeared, he recognized his identity.</p><p>He still remembered that time in Tiansang city, he had encountered the Three Incenses sovereign killer, Red Dog, and had fallen into a dead end.</p><p>It was this person that Xu Xiaoshou thought was the Bazhun’an who had appeared and used the 10 sections of the finger sword to solve his predicament.</p><p>In the end, the other party even gave him the sword observation manual.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had always been suspicious of this person’s identity.</p><p>He did not think that the other party was Bazhun’an.</p><p>This was because later on, Xu Xiaoshou had already seen the real Bazhun’an of the saint servant. Moreover, they had met face to face, talked to each other, and verified their identities.</p><p>However, the 10 sections of the finger sword that the uncle had appeared that day was real, and the sword observation manual that he had given him was also real…</p><p>It could be said that.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was able to use his sword cognition to impersonate Bazhun’an, and he was successful in everything.</p><p>The vast majority of the reason was because the person in front of him had given him the “Sword Observation Manual”, which allowed him to cultivate sword cognition.</p><p>Strictly speaking.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s sword cognition was not even learned from Bazhun’an.</p><p>It was learned from a fake that he thought was fake, and a fanatical fan that might be Bazhun’an.</p><p>But all of this.</p><p>Didn’t affect the current social death scene.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never thought that when he was impersonating Bazhun’an, there would be such a person who could also be considered as Bazhun’an.</p><p>In the past, he had heard that Bazhun’an had many fanatical fans in the eastern region, and there were also many imposters.</p><p>He didn’t believe it.</p><p>But tonight, when the two big imposters met, Xu Xiaoshou believed it!</p><p>It was hard to not believe what was happening right now..</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath and withstood everyone’s doubtful gazes. There was even a storyteller among them. Xu Xiaoshou asked, “You said that your name is Bazhun’an?”</p><p>It was only then that the scruffy-looking man finally regained his godhood.</p><p>He had seen Bazhun’an imposters before, but he had never seen one so lifelike. His subordinates were even able to pull out two storytellers to verify their identities.</p><p>What kind of terrible scene was this?</p><p>It was simply amazing!</p><p>The uncle was silent for a moment. He did not reply. He raised his eyes and asked, “From what you mean… you are also called Bazhun’an?”</p><p>In one night, the identity of the Yao residence’s door sentinel and the fake Bazhun’an were questioned one after another.</p><p>Even the aura that he had deliberately created was destroyed.</p><p>It would be a lie to say that he was not angry!</p><p>However, no matter how much anger he suppressed in his tone, it could still be heard by others.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could only laugh and shake his head slightly, using an even more ruthless tone, he muttered, “I didn’t expect that I would meet a fake one day, and it’s so realistic… you said you’re Bazhun’an, how are you going to prove your identity?”</p><p>The uncle subconsciously wanted to reply, “The real Bazhun’an doesn’t need to prove his identity.”.</p><p>But as the words came to his mouth, he remembered the scene of the guards of the Yao residence, and he didn’t want to be slapped in the face again.</p><p>Therefore, he looked around and saw that everyone was looking forward to it.</p><p>The uncle raised two fingers and suddenly revealed sword cognition.</p><p>“I have sword cognition. What about you?”</p><p>The moment sword cognition was released.</p><p>It shocked the entire scene.</p><p>However, after Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment, he also raised two fingers. Then, sword cognition also appeared on the godhood.</p><p>“What a coincidence, isn’t it?”</p><p>“Sword cognition, I have it too!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
