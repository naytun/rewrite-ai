Lend Me the Fire?</p><p><strong>Translator:</strong> Nyoi-Bo Studio <strong>Editor:</strong> Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>The judge’s seat was shocked.</p><p>No one had expected Shi Ti’s sudden violent reaction.</p><p>The good-hearted Shi Ti was not as hot-tempered as Lu Chenghui. If it was president Lu who had slammed the table and stood up, it would have been fine, but what was going on with Shi Ti?</p><p>Dong Ling glanced over curiously.</p><p>The president’s group also looked at Shi Ti.</p><p>The arena’s Xu Xiaoshou also had a look of shock and doubt on his face as he looked at the judge’s seat.</p><p>“President, it’s like this…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand. Under the gaze of everyone, he explained, “The spiritual array is a little stifling. This young master doesn’t like to be restrained. I feel that the spiritual array will trap this Young Master’s soul. I wish to apply for the removal of this spiritual array. I guarantees that it will not</p><p>affect the conducting alchemy of others!”</p><p>The arena was in an uproar.</p><p>Not many people had any expectations for this Tenth Grade Alchemist.</p><p>The arena was filled with curses when they saw Young Master Xu still putting on airs.</p><p>“What the heck!”</p><p>“Do you really think that this is the Taixiang Xu family of the Northern Region? Why do you still want to trap your soul? Why don’t you just step down from the arena? The world is vast, where can you not go?”</p><p>“That’s right! I hate this kind of trash the most, the descendant of a demi-saint… damn it, if it were me, I would be even more arrogant than him. Damn it, damn it…”</p><p>“Hmm? There’s something wrong with you!”</p><p>“Hehe, it’s a pity that I don’t have such a background. What a pity…”</p><p>“Disliked, Passive Points, + 8,456.”</p><p>“Attention, Passive Points, + 9,999.”</p><p>Just as he exited the spiritual array and attracted a wave of attention, the information bar popped up crazily again. Xu Xiaoshou was overjoyed.</p><p>In the past, he had fantasized about saying a neurotic “I’m a Master (stage)”in front of everyone. At that time, he was still an Innate (stage) and thought that he might be beaten to death after one round of shouting.</p><p>Now, his dream seemed to have come true again..</p><p>Comfortable!</p><p>Dong Ling glared at him from the judges’seats and said unhappily, “Go back! During the period of conducting alchemy, you are not allowed to leave the spiritual array at will. Otherwise, it will be regarded as a forfeit!”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face turned bitter. After hesitating for the last time, he grinded his Passive Points and returned to the spiritual array.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng was extremely emotional in his heart.</p><p>How could Young Master Xu dare to be so reckless? Wasn’t he afraid of being killed by other’s gaze and drowned with his saliva?</p><p>The staff handed out the pill formulas and the spiritual ingredients.</p><p>At this moment, the competition officially began and the timing segment began.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked around and saw that the Alchemist beside him was completely engrossed with full concentration. Then, each and every one of them began to frown. It was rather funny.</p><p>Before he could even look at the Jade Scroll and the pill, he had already thought of a fatal problem.</p><p>“My alchemy cauldron belongs to Elder Sang. Shi Ti might be able to recognize it at once. And that little girl Hua Ying, she’s looking at me. Once this cauldron appears, won’t her identity be exposed?”</p><p>Thus, under the doubtful gazes of the crowd.</p><p>This fellow hesitated as he moved his feet. However, he seemed to have thought of the newly established rules for him and did not dare to leave the spiritual array.</p><p>“What is he doing?”</p><p>The arena’s people exclaimed in shock.</p><p>This was because they discovered that that inconsiderate person was not conducting alchemy at this moment, but was actually studying the array pattern on the ground!</p><p>“What is he trying to do…”</p><p>Shi Ti was terrified.</p><p>Young Master Xu had yet to start conducting alchemy, but he could already see many shadows of Xu Xiaoshou on his body.</p><p>“Studying a spiritual array?”</p><p>Lu Chenghui’s state of mind was also ruined by this scene.</p><p>He had never seen such a vile Alchemist.</p><p>If this was in their Tianyun City, the Alchemist Badge would not even be given out.</p><p>God knows which neurotic branch president of the Northern Region would give out this Alchemist Badge. There must be something fishy about this!</p><p>Looking at the spiritual array… Dong Ling was also stunned. She wanted to shout at Young Master Xu to stop him, but she was afraid that it would affect the other contestants.</p><p>Even if the sound outside the spiritual array couldn’t be heard after the start of the competition, the image would affect the others.</p><p>Everyone present was originally paying attention to the alchemist, but they were stunned by Young Master Xu, who was studying the array pattern while conducting alchemy.</p><p>“Is he really here to conduct alchemy?”</p><p>Not long after, everyone saw the spiritual array surrounding young master Xu suddenly Swish… shut down!</p><p>“”2e</p><p>This time, everyone exploded.</p><p>Dong Ling got up with a swish, her eyebrows twitching wildly as she vaguely understood something.</p><p>I told you not to leave the spiritual array, and you shut down the spiritual array?</p><p>That’s not right!</p><p>That’s not the main point!</p><p>The main point is, how can you turn off the spiritual array?</p><p>Dong Ling met Young Master Xu’s smiling eyes in a daze, and then her gaze moved down to the array token in the judge’s seat.</p><p>The array token is with me, that’s right..</p><p>How can he turn it off?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, in the venue, turned off the spiritual array, and the information bar was flooding with messages.</p><p>The ability to construct a brand new spiritual array brought about by his “Weaving Expertise”was not strong, because he needed to think and create, but his ability to imitate and crack the spiritual array was definitely world-class.</p><p>Immediately, he closed the spiritual array. Xu Xiaoshou wanted to say something, but he hesitated. In order to express his respect, he raised his hand symbolically with an expression that said, “May I speak?”.</p><p>Dong Ling suppressed her anger and said, “Speak!”</p><p>“That…” Xu Xiaoshou faced the crowd and cursed, “You guys don’t have an alchemy cauldron? I thought you had one, so I didn’t bring one.”</p><p>2?</p><p>The jaws of the old presidents in the judge’s seat dropped.</p><p>The arena’s audience was also dumbfounded.</p><p>Didn’t bring an alchemy cauldron?</p><p>You, an Alchemist, came to participate in the competition, but you didn’t bring an alchemy cauldron…</p><p>Did you come here to be a bystander?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou faced the crow¢’s fiery gazes and felt that he had to explain a few more things:</p><p>“It’s like this. I think this is a fair competition. Naturally, using the sacred cauldron bestowed by my clan is biased.”</p><p>“But after coming to this place, I didn’t expect everyone to use their own…”</p><p>“This is very unfair!”</p><p>“My Sacred Cauldron’s success rate in conducting alchemy is too high. It’s too unfair to others, so I didn’t bring it with me, and I don’t want to use it. Thus, I have to trouble to borrow an ordinary alchemy cauldron from the President.”</p><p>The spectators were suddenly silenced.</p><p>The situation was deathly silent.</p><p>Young Master Xu’s explanation was…</p><p>Why did it have such a strong “Show off” feeling to it?</p><p>God, you’re a Tenth Grade Alchemist, yet you’re paying attention to how unfair it is to others?</p><p>Shouldn’t you try your best to use your alchemy cauldron, flames, and other places where you can use cheats in physics?</p><p>Everyone in the judge’s seat was also stumped by Young Master Xu’s words.</p><p>“What he said isn’t without reason.</p><p>“But the alchemy cauldron is a part of the Alchemist. Some people are used to using their own alchemy cauldron and it is difficult for them to adapt to using others.”</p><p>“Such a situation has never happened before, but young master Xu’s words are understandable, aren’t they?”</p><p>“Understood.</p><p>Lu Chenghui looked at this group of old foxes who were speaking in front of others due to their status, after holding it in for a long time, he could no longer hold it in. “Understand my a*s! This fellow is here to cause trouble, right? How can he disarm the spiritual array? Is there a spy at the scene? Has the</p><p>headquarters of the Magic Pill Technicians Association been infiltrated by outsiders?”</p><p>Dong Ling pinched the space between her eyebrows and did not reply.</p><p>She felt that this matter was too ridiculous and decided not to think about it for the time being.</p><p>She thought carefully about what Young Master Xu had said. Even if it was very “Ordinary’, it was indeed quite reasonable.</p><p>“The most important thing now is to stabilize the conference. We will correct the other details later.”</p><p>Shi Ti suppressed Lu Chenghui’s anger and said, “I will lend him an alchemy cauldron. Let’s put this matter aside for the time being. The competition is more important.”</p><p>Dong Ling nodded.</p><p>Lu Chenghui sat down angrily.</p><p>The other judges also let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>Everyone was old, so they were not as impulsive as they were young.</p><p>This matter concerned a demi-saint’s descendant. It was better to let it go. It would be best if it could be reduced to a minor matter.</p><p>In the judges’ seats, Shi Ti ordered the staff to send the ring.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, on the other hand, was waiting on the spot. He tumed his head happily like an old cadre and waved at the people who were paying attention to him.</p><p>So enthusiastic</p><p>Everyone was so enthusiastic</p><p>“Attention, Passive Points, + 9,999.”</p><p>“Despised, Passive Points, + 4,852.”</p><p>“Passive Points: 154,120.”</p><p>In just a short while, the Passive Points had already broken through 100,000 and started to rush towards the 200,000 mark.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou loved competitions too much.</p><p>In this kind of crowded scene, every kind-hearted gaze was a part of the increase in his own strength.</p><p>Everyone contributed to my strength today!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought.</p><p>The staff delivered the ring.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took out an ancient-looking alchemy cauldron from within.</p><p>It was unknown whether it was intentional or not, but the alchemy cauldron that president Shi Ti delivered was a size bigger than ordinary alchemy cauldrons, but it was not as exaggerated as the infernal lineage.</p><p>The quality of the alchemy cauldron was high. It was about Sixth Grade. It could be considered the mainstream quality of alchemy cauldrons among the alchemists present.</p><p>“That’s very kind of you, president Shi Ti. It’s not in vain that you and Elder sang had a wonderful past…” Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself.</p><p>At this moment, in the judge’s seat, Dong Ling held back her anger and took the array token. With a Swish, she put young master Xu back into the barrier.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was still immersed in his gratitude towards Shi Ti, saw that the information bar was no longer moving, and with his spiritual senses, he closed the spiritual array again.</p><p>Dong Ling: ???</p><p>She was stunned for a full three breaths of time. With the array token pressed, the spiritual array was opened again.</p><p>With a thought from Xu Xiaoshou’s spiritual senses, the spiritual array was off again.</p><p>On again…</p><p>Off again…</p><p>“Are you still going to compete? !”</p><p>Dong Ling slammed the judge’s table and stood up.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked, “That… I haven’t thanked you yet!”</p><p>As he spoke, he looked at Shi Ti, “Having more of this president’s alchemy cauldron solved my urgent need. I am very grateful.”</p><p>Dong Ling’s eyebrows jumped wildly.</p><p>Shi Ti’s mouth twitched. He waved his hand and stroked his beard, “Hurry up and start conducting alchemy. Don’t cause trouble!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled.</p><p>With just one opening and one closing, tens of thousands of Passive Points were added into his account.</p><p>It was easy to earn. How could he not cause trouble?</p><p>The spiritual array was forcefully activated again.</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou did not go against Dong Ling. He quietly used his spiritual senses to change the array pattern. On the basis of not damaging the original function of the spiritual array, he let in the sounds of the outside world.</p><p>“This Young Master Xu is so annoying!”</p><p>“What on earth is he doing here? Someone is already conducting alchemy, yet he doesn’t even look at the pill formula.”</p><p>“I suspect that he is here for grandstanding!”</p><p>A large wave of discussion entered his ears. Following that, the information bar jumped.</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, + 1524.”</p><p>“Disliked, Passive Points, + 2334.”</p><p>“Attention, Passive Points, + 9,999.”</p><p>Hehe… Xu Xiaoshou smiled slyly in his heart.</p><p>Among the group of Alchemists present, no one was able to detect that he had tampered with the spiritual array, including the array token-wielding president of Dong Ling.</p><p>Sovereign (stage) ‘Weaving Expertise’ was too powerful.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but sigh. It involved the path patterns and Divine Secret.</p><p>He was afraid that his small actions could only be detected by the old fellows at the spiritual array competition venue.</p><p>As for now…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s spiritual senses were spying on Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>Even Rao Yaoyao did not move an inch, not to mention the others.</p><p>“Conducting alchemy.”</p><p>He held the jade scroll and peered at the formula for the Thirst Generating Pill.</p><p>Then, Xu Xiaoshou put down the jade scroll and silently turned his head to look at the scene.</p><p>Just like the previous groups of people, even though he had finished conducting alchemy, he still decided to start.</p><p>At this moment, most of the people present were still in a daze.</p><p>There were some who had started conducting alchemy, but most of them still had a worried expression on their faces, unable to understand the true meaning of the formula.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou recalled the formula for the Thirst Generating Pill, but his face was filled with a strange expression.</p><p>“Just this?”</p><p>He originally thought that the recipe would be difficult for a Sixth Grade Alchemist. Even if it wasn’t, it would still bring him some difficulty.</p><p>He didn’t expect that when the formula entered his eyes, not only did he not sense anything amiss, he even deduced more than ten ways to improve it.</p><p>Limited to spiritual medicine, he couldn’t make many improvements.</p><p>But he really didn’t know how this thing could trap most people for so long!</p><p>“Tm too powerful…”</p><p>He turned around and glanced at Yu Chuchu on the other side.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized that this girl hadn’t started refining yet, and she still had a gloomy expression on her face.</p><p>“Lwarned you!” Xu Xiaoshou sighed.</p><p>He also thought for a long time before he understood what this very shallow pill formula was trying to test other people for.</p><p>Foundation!</p><p>Hidden medicinal properties!</p><p>Conflicting medicinal properties!</p><p>Basically, there were only these three points.</p><p>However, because his foundation was too solid, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even notice the mystical aspects of this pill formula at the first moment.</p><p>It wasn’t until he realized that he and the elixir master present weren’t on the same starting line at all..</p><p>“The arena of conducting alchemy that only cares about the results?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t intend to proceed according to the pill formula.</p><p>His understanding and strength did not allow him to use such a crude pill formula to waste precious spiritual medicine.</p><p>And according to his speculation, he wanted to use the steps of this pill formula to refine the highest grade, which was a full score of elixirs.</p><p>Other than proficiency, there was no other way.</p><p>This pill formula was obviously rushed out by temporary workers. It was completely different from the mature pill formulas on the market.</p><p>To put it bluntly…</p><p>It was very inferior!</p><p>Therefore, he set up the alchemy cauldron. With a thought, Xu Xiaoshou was about to compress the refined fire seed, but he suddenly stopped.</p><p>“That was close…”</p><p>Infernal White Flame was also a symbol!</p><p>But if he had to borrow fire…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyes and looked at the judge’s seat.</p><p>‘As expected, none of the eighteen judges paid attention to the others at this moment. Alll of them were looking at him!</p><p>“Will he be beaten to death? Borrowing the fire…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rejected the idea of taking another wave of Passive Points. With a move of his spiritual senses, he drew out of thin air.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>A jet-black flame that was as black as ink suddenly appeared.</p><p>“Young Master Xu’s Fire!”</p><p>The outsiders pointed his finger, and everyone immediately turned to look at him.</p><p>Ina situation where there weren’t many people conducting alchemy yet, the demi-saint’s descendant and a Tenth Grade Alchemist had already started conducting alchemy. This was something that was enough to attract everyone’s attention.</p><p>“Why does this fire seem unreal?”</p><p>“Yes, what a magical fire. I’m not talking about that kind of magical fire. I’m talking about… a strange feeling?”</p><p>“T’ve seen the spiritual fire of thousands of genius Alchemists, each displaying their own abilities. However, I’ve never seen such a fire like Young Master Xu’s. It feels like ink, as if it’s drawn.”</p><p>“What a fake flame!”</p><p>Someone said something ridiculous.</p><p>However, this ridiculous “fake flame” gave off a very fitting feeling.</p><p>Indeed, Young Master Xu’s flame was too fake. It was as if a water attribute spiritual cultivator had forcefully used a spiritual technique to squeeze it out. It didn’t fit in at all.</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points + 5,941.”</p><p>“Expected, Passive Points, + 1,234..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
