As he poured, he asked curiously.</p><p>It was late at night.</p><p>But this time, he was not the one who disturbed Master Siren’s rest.</p><p>It was Mei siren who came to the door immediately after talking with Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>“Can you hear our conversation?”Mei Siren asked casually with surprise in his eyes.</p><p>“Yes.”Xu Xiaoshou nodded.</p><p>‘The elder Sword Deity didn’t intend to explain much when he saw the little guy in front of him, and he didn’t ask much either. He only said that it was a special method, so it was inconvenient for him to say anything,</p><p>“Lhave already touched the threshold of the Holy Path, so Rao Yaoyao won’t be able to investigate further. Besides, under the interference of Holy Power, she probably won’t even have the desire to investigate further.”</p><p>Holy Power interfered with one’s thoughts?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have realized something. He recalled the time in the White Cave when he was blocked by the way of the heavens and could not find Yu Lingdi.</p><p>Even Yu Lingdi, who had reached the final-stage of the Path Level, could do such a thing to him.</p><p>‘The Meis who had touched the threshold of the holy path, under non-combat circumstances, were able to slightly influence Rao Yaoyao’s thoughts and force her to retreat. It did not seem too much.</p><p>“Who among the Seven Sword Deity has come into contact with the Holy Path?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>‘The Mei Siren fanned themselves and counted, “You Tu, Feng Tingchen, and this old man… all count. However, we are all of the older generation, so this achievement is nothing.”</p><p>After a pause, he sighed, “For the younger generation, Sword Deity Hua has already become a demi-saint. Wen Ting is still one step away and the other two are still some distance away.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows.</p><p>He had heard rumors before, but he was still unsure.</p><p>However, Hua Changdeng had already become a demi-saint. If these words came out of Mei Siren’s mouth, then it was a done deal.</p><p>It was rumored that Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe had a Hallmaster Dao who could not be called by his holy name. If this was added, then it would be two demi-saints.</p><p>Terrifying!</p><p>‘What was even more terrifying was that to the world, it was an almost unreachable demi-saint realm.</p><p>To the Seven Sword Deity, it seemed to be a matter of time?</p><p>No wonder the title “Seven Sword Deity” had such a revered status in the Continent.</p><p>This was equivalent to seven confirmed demi-saint!</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou thought of Ai Cangsheng, who was sitting on a wheelchair in the Eighth Palace from afar. He hesitated and said, “That disabled person who sat on Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe with a bow and arrow…”</p><p>Mei Siren couldn’t react for a moment. After a while, he smiled and said, “He’s also a demi-saint.”</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gasped. He wasn’t sure before, but now he was sure.</p><p>Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe had three demi-saints on the surface?</p><p>No wonder it was the number one faction in the Continent!</p><p>“What you said…” Mei Siren shook his head as he was speechless at Xu Xiaoshou’s description of the disabled man with a bow and arrow.</p><p>“You can’t call him by his holy name.” Xu Xiaoshou chuckled.</p><p>But soon, he couldn’t laugh anymore.</p><p>He still remembered in the higher void (level) fantasy realm, he told Elder Sang that he would ascend to the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe if Elder Sang called him by his Sovereign (level) .</p><p>Now that he thought about it, the difficulty was comparable to ascending to the sky.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless. He refused to let go of the walking history book in front of him. He continued to ask, “Who else in this world has touched the threshold of the Holy Path, or in other words, has entered the demi-saint realm?”</p><p>“Who else…” the corner of Mei Siren’s mouth twitched. He almost knocked down the folding fan in his hand and said in a bad mood, “Who else?”</p><p>“The demi-saint factions in the five regions have been in seclusion since ancient times. They don’t enter the mortal world, so they don’t count…”</p><p>“The ghost beast host body that contains Holy Power on the Abyss Island, as well as those who have come out and are living on the Continent…”</p><p>“In addition, there are the various peak factions and those who are participating in the struggle for power in the world…”</p><p>“Do you want me to count all of these one by one and read them to you?”</p><p>Mei Siren frowned and his expression turned ugly.</p><p>“Uh!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his scalp go numb for a moment.</p><p>It would have been fine if he didn’t count them. After hearing what Master Siren said, he felt that he had really fallen into Elder Sang’s trap.</p><p>‘There was a sky beyond the heavens!</p><p>Why did it feel like there were so many demi-saint’s appearances?</p><p>“Not many.”</p><p>Mei Siren knew what he was thinking, he sighed and said, “What I listed does not count. At least for some reason, they can not reveal their Holy Power on the mainland. Otherwise, they will be punished by the Holy Tribulation. The consequences will be extremely severe.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had caught a blind spot, “What reason?”</p><p>The Mei Siren shook their heads and did not speak.</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was disappointed. Was it a secret that he could not be told? Damn it…</p><p>“What’s the consequence? Will he die?” He asked again. He felt that he could at least tell him the reason.</p><p>Mei Siren shook his head, “He won’t die, but the price will be terrible. It’s possible for him to fall out of the Saint Realm. Under the force of rules, becoming a saint is equivalent to…”</p><p>He suddenly stopped talking.</p><p>“Equivalent to what?” Xu Xiaoshou’s heart itched when he saw the old Sword Deity keeping him in suspense.</p><p>Mei Siren sighed, “A young man is full of energy, and a demi-saint imprisons himself in a corner. You’ll have to figure it out yourself!”</p><p>What did he mean?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost did not get himself out of all these twists and confusion.</p><p>He understood the first half of the sentence that when he was young, he was full of energy, and it was not difficult to understand.</p><p>But the second half of the sentence…</p><p>Demi-saint imprisons himself in a corner?</p><p>This was a little too scary!</p><p>Could it be that after becoming a demi-saint, he could not walk around the Continent like a young man?</p><p>“Have you ever seen a demi-saint?” Mei Siren people asked with a smile.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou subconsciously shook his head. Soon, his pupils constricted as he thought of something.</p><p>“No way? Is it really what I think it is?” His mouth was wide open and he was a little shocked.</p><p>Mei Siren jokingly explained, “The great war of the demi-saint might destroy this world, so they can’t do anything rash.”</p><p>“Tm nota child anymore, okay…” Xu Xiaoshou exclaimed in his heart.</p><p>If it was before, he might have thought that Master Siren’s explanation was reasonable.</p><p>But now, he would only think that these so-called rules and regulations were just an illusion.</p><p>The Continent also explicitly forbade the throne to make a move. If they really wanted to fight, they would need to do so in the air or in the bounded domain.</p><p>But after the real night battle in the Imperial City, Xu Xiaoshou understood.</p><p>He was anxious. Who cared whether it was a bounded domain or not?</p><p>Using the shortest amount of time to kill the enemy was the most correct way to not destroy the environment.</p><p>But the Continent still had these strange restrictions..</p><p>‘When Xu Xiaoshou thought about how even the Sovereign (stage) had these restrictions, the restrictions of Cutting Path (stage) and higher void (level) were even greater.</p><p>Then, it seemed that it was understandable for demi-saint to imprison himself and think along the way?</p><p>“Something’s wrong.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that if he continued to think carefully, he should be able to find something.</p><p>However, he always felt that he was close.</p><p>He was so close, but he felt that there was a final barrier between him and the truth.</p><p>However, he could not figure out where and what this barrier was?</p><p>“There’s no need to think about it. You’re only a Master (stage) , and the throne can even interfere with your thoughts. Do you think you can come up with an explanation?” Mei Siren picked up his teacup, shook his head, and smiled. Then, he took a sip.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was frightened and shocked.</p><p>However, after the shock, he could not sense the great terror that he had just experienced and what it was exactly.</p><p>He could only put it down helplessly.</p><p>“Master Siren, what I want to ask is, other than those who can’t make a move, among the five regions, are there many who can be considered to have touched the Holy Path, as well as demi-saint?”Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows.</p><p>‘The Mei Siren saw through the hidden meaning in the young man’s words, “You want to ask about the enemies that you might face in the future, right?”</p><p>“Hehe…” Xu Xiaoshou scratched his head in embarrassment.</p><p>The “you that Master Siren was talking about was not only Xu Xiaoshou, but also the Saint Servant.</p><p>Obviously, the elder Sword Deity knew what Xu Xiaoshou wanted to ask after knowing Xu Xiaoshou’s position.</p><p>“Actually, you have the answer. Basically, it’s only what you know…”</p><p>As he spoke, he put down the teacup and tapped the edge of the teacup with his finger, he said with disappointment, “Most of the demi-saints in the world are in the Holy Divine Palace and the Holy Palace. The rest are scattered outside. Basically, there are people watching them. It’s impossible for them</p><p>to make a move.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was silent upon hearing this.</p><p>By now, he had long understood that the Holy Divine Palace and the Holy Palace were actually the only ones with equal status on the Continent.</p><p>However, the former was the number one faction on the Continent, which was responsible for fighting and managing the world.</p><p>‘The demi-saint faction was a training base for demi-saints. Other than cultivating, they were basically ignorant of the affairs of the world. They were purely an academy.</p><p>Demi-saints on the Continent might not be as rare as what was rumored on the streets.</p><p>In other words, the people on the streets might not even be able to determine if there really was a demi-saint on the continent.</p><p>However, for the vast majority of people…</p><p>No!</p><p>It should be said that for all the people on the Continent, the level of demi-saint was basically something that they could not come into contact with.</p><p>Therefore, the legendary demi-saint was the highest combat strength in this world. It was as invisible as a god, which was actually not true.</p><p>But ina sense, it could also be true.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was different.</p><p>He felt that he was trapped in the trap of the Saint Servant. In the future, he might face demi-saint stage opponents directly.</p><p>But if he wanted to know more, it seemed that even Master Siren could not say much..</p><p>At this moment, Mei Siren couldn’t help but laugh, “Don’t worry too much. You’re only a junior Master (stage) , how could you think of going so far away? Your brain… tsk tsk.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also laughed.</p><p>He felt that it was true!</p><p>He had gone overboard again. How could a demi-saint attack him?</p><p>Even Sword Deity Rao didn’t come to the First Pavilion in the Sky to look for him. He only wanted to visit Master Siren, who was also a seven sword deity.</p><p>He was just worrying about nothing. The emperor was no longer anxious.</p><p>That kind of thinking should be something that Bazhun’an should consider.</p><p>Elder Sang was right. As a chess piece, he should just do his part. Why should he be a chess player? Why did he think he was extraordinary?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had seen almost every genius on this Continent grow up with the template of the protagonist.</p><p>Regardless of whether it was the younger generation or the middle-aged or old generation.</p><p>Basically, those who were famous had their own legends.</p><p>He no longer dared to act as he did in the past, thinking that he was extraordinary just because he had a Passive System.</p><p>At this moment, a spiritual light flashed through Xu Xiaoshou’s mind. He felt that he had once again caught a blind spot. He raised his eyes and looked at the elder in front of him, “Master Siren, when did you master Holy Power?”</p><p>Mei Siren stared at the youth. Suddenly, a smile bloomed on his face.</p><p>He felt that this kid, who could use two identities to shuttle back and forth during the night battle in the Imperial City, was very interesting. His brain was very good.</p><p>In the time it took for a few words, he had already probed out something.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also chuckled and said in a low voice, “Master Siren is a genius, right? Otherwise, how could he obtain the title of Seven Sword Deity? and among the young generation of Seven Sword Deity, there are already people who have become demi-saint…”</p><p>“Stop.” Master Siren stretched out his hand. Obviously, he didn’t want to talk about this. He just smiled and shook his head helplessly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stopped in time.</p><p>He looked at Master Siren’s smile that made people feel like a spring breeze.</p><p>He didn’t know why, but he actually saw the great terror hidden behind the smile.</p><p>After a long pause, Xu Xiaoshou asked, “On this continent, besides the Holy Divine Palace and the Holy Palace, is there anyone who ‘dares’to break through to become a demi-saint?”</p><p>Mei Siren’s eyes turned slightly white, and he scolded with a smile, “Put away your little tricks. There’s no such thing as ‘dare’ or ‘not dare’.”</p><p>“Is there?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Who?” Xu Xiaoshou leaned forward slightly.</p><p>Mei Siren laughed out loud, “You Tu, the bravest person on this Continent!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>The bravest person on this continent?</p><p>What kind of description was that?</p><p>You Tu… Xu Xiaoshou knew about him.</p><p>At the beginning of the list of Seven Sword Deity, there was no ranking of strength. There were only seven people.</p><p>At that time, these Seven Sword Deity were only at the cultivation level of the higher void (level) . None of them were demi-saint.</p><p>However, there was only one person who had been called the head of the Seven Sword Deity by the world. It was as if there was no basis for it. It was You Tu.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought about it carefully.</p><p>It seemed that he really didn’t know that there was anyone who had reached the demi-saint realm on his own besides the Holy Divine Palace, the Holy Palace, and some ghost beast.</p><p>‘There wasn’t even an Eighth Sword Deity!</p><p>The person whom Master Siren had mentioned..</p><p>“You Tu?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou murmured in a daze. When he came back to his senses, he hurriedly shut his mouth.</p><p>He realized that if the other party had already reached the demi-saint realm, then he would be addressing him by his holy name. It would be very disrespectful! I he was discovered, he could be dead!</p><p>“It doesn’t matter. Everyone calls him that, so he doesn’t mind.” Mei Siren waved his hand, indicating that everything was fine.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou came to a sudden realization. He recalled that when everyone mentioned You Tu, the Seven Sword Deity, they all called You Tu by his name. In the end, nothing happened.</p><p>‘That was why he subconsciously believed that You Tu was still a Sword Deity.</p><p>“So, he’s already a sword saint…”</p><p>“He was a long time ago.” Mei Siren’s eyes were filled with admiration when he mentioned You Tu.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at all of this and suddenly thought of what the elders had said, “The bravest person on this ontinent.”.</p><p>So he asked, “So, is the legend of You Tu really true?”</p><p>It was said that you tu had killed the former Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace with Seven Swords and forced Dao Qiongcang to rise to the throne in a hurry.</p><p>In the Tiansang Spirit Palace, the former Xu Xiaoshou had learned the “White Cloud Sword Technique” for three years, which was derived from You Tu’s “Seven Swords of the Moving Heavens”. It was just a simplified version of the spiritual technique after dozens of dimensional reductions.</p><p>In the past, Xu Xiaoshou had just listened to the legend casually and did not care.</p><p>Now he knew how exaggerated it was.</p><p>Even if You Tu was a demi-saint at that time, there should be more than one demi-saint on Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, right?</p><p>Moreover, the previous Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace wouldn’t go so far as to..</p><p>Seven Swords!</p><p>He didn’t even have the power to parry, and it get overwhelmed right away, right? !</p><p>At this time, Mei Siren smiled. “It’s true.”</p><p>‘The thoughts in Xu Xiaoshou’s mind suddenly stopped. He was dumbfounded, “Huh?”</p><p>Bazhun‘an took another sip of tea. Using the tone of a bard, he narrated a story that he seemed to have seen with his own eyes,</p><p>“That day, Bazhun’an charged out from the Cross Corner Street. It took him three years to become a Sword Deity. However, there were only Seven Sword Deity. He was young and full of spirit. He challenged one of them outside the City of the Dead Bodhisattva…”</p><p>Hua Changdeng!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s breathing quickened, “And then?”</p><p>Mei Siren said, “Of course, Sword Deity Hua has to accept the challenge. Bazhun’an was titled the most powerful Way of the Sword since ancient times, and it is no joke.” “But on the day of the decisive battle, when the battle began, just when everyone thought that the title of Sword Deity was about to</p><p>change hands, Bazhun‘an’s saber, Sword Qingju (sword) , was cut off on the spot. Sword Deity Hua struck three times, ending the legend of the Eighth Sword Deity.”</p><p>‘That was it?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waited for a while and did not see anything else. He thought to himself, “My neck is aching. is that all you’re going to tell me?”</p><p>What about the process?</p><p>Others could only summarize it briefly, but you just omit it?</p><p>He looked at the silent and smiling faces of Mei Siren and came to a sudden realization. So this was not something that could be said?</p><p>Silence?</p><p>‘The conversation of the people of Mei Si changed.</p><p>“Bazhun‘an was already one of You Tu’s people at that time.”</p><p>“After this battle, You Tu immediately became a saint and charged up Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe all by himself. He then beheaded the previous Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace with Seven Swords and left.”</p><p>“From now on, he will never enter the mortal world again..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
