What Do You Want with the Spirit Array while only Conducting Alchemy</p><p><strong>Translator:</strong> Nyoi-Bo Studio <strong>Editor:</strong> Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“Next batch!”</p><p>‘When the time was up, the emotionless voice of the staff member rang out.</p><p>Some of the Alchemists in the spirit-gathering array came out with excitement, while others with disappointment.</p><p>As the judges ended their scoring, new names popped up one after another, drawing the attention of the crowd.</p><p>At this moment, four groups of people had come down, and all of the 100 people on the list had appeared. Some of the Alchemists who had been pushed down from the list were disheartened.</p><p>Those who had been pushed to the end and fell into the danger zone were also extremely nervous.</p><p>And no matter what.</p><p>The first round of the grand competition of conducting alchemy would only proceed as usual.</p><p>Under the anxious gazes of the audience and the contestants on the waiting field, Xu Xiaoshou stood up and moved.</p><p>2381, this was his number.</p><p>The fifth call was his batch.</p><p>“Look!”</p><p>“yu Chuchu, President Dong Ling’s disciple, is also on the stage.”</p><p>“Lwonder what rank she’ll get? I think she’s in the top three. After all, she’s the disciple of the president of the headquarters of the Magic Pill Technicians Association. Miss Yu’s strength is extraordinary.”</p><p>“I think that’s very hard for her to get. There are too many geniuses in the five regions. Currently, there are only seven people with more than 90 points on the list.”</p><p>“I think it’s great that Yu Chuchu can get more than 90 points. Look at Zhu Yan in the first batch. Both of them are Sixth Grade, but he only has 86 points.”</p><p>“That’s true.”</p><p>The audience discussed fervently.</p><p>Among the last batch of Alchemists, Yu Chuchu was naturally the one who attracted the most attention was</p><p>‘The young girl’s lotus steps attracted almost everyone’s attention.</p><p>Even the old president of the judging panel cast their gazes over one after another.</p><p>Unlike most of the audience’s attention, even though Yu Chuchu was a Sixth Grade, the judge only took a glance at her before jumping over.</p><p>This girl was very familiar.</p><p>At the same time, they looked at the much taller young man beside them.</p><p>“He’s the one who developed amber juice… Young Master Xu?” Lu Chenghui turned his head to look at President Dong Ling.</p><p>“Humph!” President Lu snorted, “He’s just a Tenth Grade. I’d like to see how far he can go. How could he be the next Qiu Jiangzhi?”</p><p>Shi Ti turned his eyes to look at him. “That might be the case. Maybe he’s hiding even deeper…”</p><p>He was implying something.</p><p>However, no one in the judge’s seat could read between the lines.</p><p>Whether it’s a mule or a horse, I’ll just pull it out for a stroll… Shi Ti thought to himself.</p><p>He thought that if this fellow was Xu Xiaoshou, with that Brats conducting alchemy style, most of the people present would be in danger.</p><p>And if something similar to the explosion of the pill tower happened…</p><p>Without a doubt, even if he didn’t look at the origin of the Alchemist Badge, Shi Ti was certain that what he was thinking was correct.</p><p>“Xiao Wanfeng!”</p><p>1</p><p>‘The arena moved in response. Xu Xiaoshou called out to the young man who was serving tea behind him and stepped into the arena.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, this is really not very good…”</p><p>Before he left, Xiao Wanfeng became timid.</p><p>He looked around at the tens of thousands of people who were watching. He felt that it was a little too eye-catching for him to be the only newbie in conducting alchemy.</p><p>‘The key was that he did not understand what spiritual ingredients and medicinal properties were at all.</p><p>If Young Master Xu really wanted him to hand over some spiritual medicine, he did not even know which one was which!</p><p>“What are you afraid of?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around and smiled, “There are three big delusions in life: she is looking at me, and the time is still long, and I can counter-kill. Don’t be too pretentious. Perhaps in the eyes of others, you are just a side character.”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng was stunned.</p><p>He didn’t expect that Young Master Xu could say such philosophical words.</p><p>Thinking carefully, it seemed to be real right?</p><p>“Then, then I will just go through the motions?”</p><p>Therefore, Xiao Wanfeng followed after him hesitantly.</p><p>‘The two of them moved forward together and walked into the same spiritual array under the teasing and funny gazes of others…</p><p>This time, the audience exploded.</p><p>‘The old president in the judge’s seat was also shocked.</p><p>‘The same spiritual array?</p><p>“This?”</p><p>“They went in by mistake?”</p><p>“How did these two enter the same spiritual-gathering array? I know Young Master Xu in the front, but who’s that guy at the back? Why did he enter Young Master Xu’s spiritual array? Where’s his number plate?”</p><p>“Haha, outsider, are you dumbfounded? That’s the person who served tea and poured water from the first pavilion in the sky. His name is Xiao Wanfeng, the champion of the heaven geomantic battle, but he should be considered a newbie of conducting alchemy today.”</p><p>“The champion of the heaven geomantic battle, the newbie of conducting alchemy???”</p><p>“Come, come, come, let me tell you something. I love telling stories…”</p><p>‘The arena’s judge wasn’t the only one who was dumbfounded. At the same time, he turned his head to look at President Dong Ling.</p><p>“2m</p><p>‘The old fellows didn’t say anything, but the inquisitive look in their eyes jumped out.</p><p>Dong Ling held her forehead with an expression of a headache, “It’s just Young Master Xu’s usual style. Everyone should be used to it.”</p><p>“Ridiculous!”</p><p>Lu Chenghui slapped the table and was about to stand u, “He’s just a mere Tenth Grade, yet he’s bringing an alchemy newbie into the venue. What kind of nonsense is this? is the grand convention of conducting alchemy a child’s game? How can he be so impudent? !”</p><p>All of the old presidents were very angry with a wry face.</p><p>Conducting alchemy in such a manner was not popular in the alchemy world. It was important that those who were capable were the teachers, and everyone was equal.</p><p>This Young Master Xu actually brought his clan’s dandy style into the venue?</p><p>How could he tolerate it?</p><p>Lu Chenghui pointed at the scene and was about to curse, but President Dong Ling didn’t stop him.</p><p>At this moment, Shi Ti faintly mentioned something.</p><p>“Demi-saint’s descendant.”</p><p>Lu Chenghui’s words came to an abrupt halt. The corners of his mouth twitched, and he began to consider whether his identity was enough to blame a demi-saint’s descendant.</p><p>Soon, he chose to shift the attack, “President Dong Ling, aren’t you going to stop this?”</p><p>There was a “shock” in his voice.</p><p>He was indeed an old fox after all. He didn’t want to be the first to take the heat, so president Lu chose to let president Dong Ling bear all of this.</p><p>“The rules didn’t say yes, nor did they say no. Let him go, just this one.”How could Dong Ling fall into a trap?</p><p>She had almost fought with Young Master Xu at the Spirit Gem Trade Fair.</p><p>How could she not know that this was a brazen one?</p><p>‘The other party was just trying to sensationalize the crowd and steal the limelight. Yet, you still foolishly bumped into him and didn’t give the other party a chance to show off?</p><p>It was hard to say whether it was a good thing or a disaster for the demi-saint faction to have such a descendant..</p><p>‘The crowd didn’t deny Young Master Xu’s actions. In the eyes of others, this was just another form of tacit approval.</p><p>The arena was filled with curses.</p><p>HEY.”</p><p>On the other hand, young master Xu and Han Xin.</p><p>After entering the spiritual array, Xiao Wanfeng naturally took out the table and chair from his ring and spread them out. Young Master Xu sat on the golden chair with familiarity. He crossed his legs and stepped on the golden table, unmoved by outsiders.</p><p>The youth beside him took out a tea set and began to brew tea. Guan Gong patrolled the city, Han Xin ordered troops… the entire process was extremely smooth, like a qualified person serving tea and pouring water.</p><p>“Is he crazy?”</p><p>When the Alchemists saw this scene, they were all dumbfounded.</p><p>‘Whether it was the people outside the city or the people inside the city, this was the first time they saw someone conducting alchemy in such a manner.</p><p>“Is it because I can’t keep up with the trend of the times, or is there something wrong with him?”</p><p>The many Alchemists who were paying attention to this scene looked at each other. After exchanging glances with each other, they received the answer, “It’s not me, it’s him.”.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>Separated by a person, Yu Chuchu was on the left side of Xu Xiaoshou. Her gums were about to be crushed.</p><p>The pill formula and spiritual ingredients had not arrived yet. He looked at the Innate Sword Intent of a genius like Xiao Wanfeng, who was acting like an ordinary servant, doing the work of a lowly person. She only felt a burning anger.</p><p>“He doesn’t have any human rights in his eyes!”</p><p>Yu Chuchu clenched her small fists and her eyes narrowed into slits.</p><p>Although she still didn’t have a good impression of Young Master Xu during their previous exchange, she could understand his style of speaking a little.</p><p>But now that he had entered the spiritual array like this.</p><p>Young Master Xu still wanted Xiao Wanfeng to do these lowly jobs under the gaze of everyone. In Yu Chuchu’s eyes, this was simply an insult to human rights.</p><p>It was fine if it was someone else.</p><p>But Xiao Wanfeng was a genius, a genius, who didn’t deserve such treatment!</p><p>In her anger, Yu Chuchu even wanted to step out of the spiritual array and confront Young Master Xu face to face. Then, she would drag Xiao Wanfeng over and tell him, “You are actually very powerful. You should not only focus on these dirty and tiring tasks.”.</p><p>“silence!”</p><p>In the judge’s seat, Dong Ling suddenly shouted, suppressing the restlessness of everyone present.</p><p>Yu Chuchu raised her eyes and looked over.</p><p>Supreme Master Dong Ling, who was in the judge’s seat, also raised her eyes and looked over. The two of them only looked at each other before their eyes met.</p><p>Yu Chuchu understood something.</p><p>Conducting alchemy had its own rules.</p><p>Young Master Xu was Young Master Xu. To put it bluntly, demi-saint’s descendant was a little arrogant. That was his own matter. If he couldn’t conduct alchemy in the end, he would be punished by public opinion after all.</p><p>However, if she wanted to forcefully barge into someone else’s spiritual array and cause trouble, that would be a little irrational.</p><p>“That annoying fellow…”</p><p>Yu Chuchu understood the logic.</p><p>At that moment, his impression of Young Master Xu had dropped to the lowest, most vile level.</p><p>“As expected, it’s gone.”</p><p>After entering the spiritual array, even if he displayed such a stance, the information bar had no reaction when he looked at it.</p><p>He knew that this was the same as the Tiansang Spirit Palace’s Windcloud Competition. The spiritual array had blocked information from the outside world.</p><p>“annoying thing…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hated the spiritual array.</p><p>‘There were clearly tens of thousands of people outside. He could obviously get more Passive Points, but he could only hide in this small place?</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng finished making tea, and Xu Xiaoshou began to drink.</p><p>After the youth finished his work, he raised his eyes to look at his surroundings, as if a lifetime had passed.</p><p>‘There was a sea of people.</p><p>Everyone was watching.</p><p>At the age of 16, before he met young master Xu, Xiao Wanfeng felt that his way of living was the way of most of the people at the bottom.</p><p>He was trembling with fear, as if he was treading on thin ice.</p><p>He lived his life carefully and humbly.</p><p>However, ever since he joined the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>He was able to fight with Innate masters in the heaven geomantic arena as if he was hiding his sword. He was also able to be brought to an elegant place like the grand meeting of conducting alchemy. He was able to do something as vulgar as setting up a table and making tea.</p><p>It was just like the noise outside the spiritual array compared to the silence inside where there was only the sound of tea.</p><p>That kind of incompatible feeling caused Xiao Wanfeng to sigh a little.</p><p>“You have some thoughts?”</p><p>The scene was maintaining order. Xu Xiaoshou knew that his actions had caused a great commotion in the outer field.</p><p>But president Dong Ling had actually suppressed it for him!</p><p>‘Taking advantage of this gap, Xu Xiaoshou saw that Xiao Wanfeng beside him had some feelings for him. Xu Xiaoshou thought of something and asked with a smile, “In a place like this, don’t you feel a little ashamed that i ask you to do such things?”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng was stunned. He didn’t expect Young Master Xu to be so direct.</p><p>‘Xu Xiaoshou pointed in Yu Chuchu’s direction and said with a smile, “Look over there. Miss Chuchu looks like she wants to kill me.”</p><p>‘Then he looked around and said, “There were strange movements at the scene. No one agreed with what I did. Their eyes were full of contempt, and they thought that I was too high-profile and that it was harmful.”</p><p>“What about you?”</p><p>His gaze finally returned to the young man, “What do you think? Are you embarrassed?”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng paused for a moment, “A little.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows.</p><p>‘The young man frowned and continued to add, “But it’s not a problem.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng’s gaze was very clear as he guessed:</p><p>“T’ve always felt that Young Master Xu is not such a person. When you were at the First Pavilion in the Sky, you did not do anything similar to brother Xin and others. On the contrary, you were very polite, without establishing that superior and subordinate kind of relationship at all. You were more like…a</p><p>brother! It’s the same for me.”</p><p>“But it’s completely different when you’re outside. Others won’t be able to tell that you’re putting on airs, but I feel that everything you’re doing is so obvious. You’re just pretending.”</p><p>“As for why, I don’t know.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was surprised.</p><p>This little brother… is so smart!</p><p>‘As expected, a person who was able to comprehend a unique Hidden Sword Technique couldn’t be considered stupid no matter what.</p><p>Asan insider, he could easily see through his disguise, but in reality, he was extremely cooperative?</p><p>If he did not ask, Xu Xiaoshou would not even know Xiao Wanfeng’s true thoughts.</p><p>He asked curiously, “Then what do you think I’m doing this for?”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng shook his head. “I don’t understand. Young Master Xu has a secret. The First Pavilion in the Sky has a secret, and I also have a secret too.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng smiled as well.</p><p>Everyone had a secret.</p><p>It was a tacit understanding.</p><p>After the silence, the commotion outside the arena and the silence inside the spiritual array formed a stark contrast. At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou actually began to sigh.</p><p>He looked at the resentful scene around him and suddenly thought of everything he had felt when he first arrived at Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>At that time, he felt that he was not as open-minded as Xiao Wanfeng.</p><p>At least…</p><p>“Xiao Wanfeng, let me ask you, if an expert who might be an evil person suddenly appeared in front of you and gave you pain that was worse than death, what would you think?” Xu Xiaoshou suddenly asked.</p><p>Me?</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng keenly sensed that Young Master Xu had fallen into a certain emotional state.</p><p>Young Master Xu would only call himself “me” when he was communicating with little brother Xin unconsciously or when he was not present.</p><p>In front of others, he would usually refer to himself as “this young master”.</p><p>“Lwill hate him,”Xiao Wanfeng replied.</p><p>“Then what if after the pain, you have a very strong ability?” Xu Xiaoshou asked again.</p><p>“Hmm…”Xiao Wanfeng hesitated for a moment, “I still hate him.”</p><p>“He forcefully took you as his disciple, but you can’t beat him, so you can only agree?”</p><p>“Then agree.”</p><p>“What if he treats you very well after that?”</p><p>“Un!”</p><p>This time, Xiao Wanfeng was dumbfounded.</p><p>This question was a little disgusting. After torturing someone, he began to treat them kindly. Could they let the past stay in the past?</p><p>That wouldn’t do!</p><p>But “he treats you very well”.</p><p>How long would this “very well” last?</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng didn’t get the answer. He suddenly fixed his gaze on Young Master Xu. He had a vague feeling that Young Master Xu’s secret was about to be revealed. However, through that layer of window paper, he couldn’t expose it, so he couldn’t pry into it at all.</p><p>“There’s no standard answer I guess…”the youth sighed.</p><p>“There isn’t.”</p><p>“Then what about Young Master Xu’s answer?”</p><p>“My answer…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed.</p><p>He thought of the scene when he asked Bazhun’an the answer. How similar was this scene?</p><p>And it was precisely because he discovered something similar about Xiao Wanfeng that he began to feel that this youth might not be a passerby on a journey in his life.</p><p>“How long will you stay in the First Pavilion in the Sky?”Xu Xiaoshou asked back.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng was stunned. “I don’t know. I haven’t thought about this question.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pulled back the previous question. In his dream, Elder Sang gave his own answer from a different perspective:</p><p>“Everyone is not the so-called main character of the way of the heavens. Everyone is a passerby in the eyes of another person</p><p>“You might as well think from another person’s perspective. In a certain situation, when that person has the desire to explain to you, you will have the value of your existence. And before that, you will always be a passerby</p><p>“We meet by chance, and we are guests from another country. No one will take you seriously.”</p><p>After pausing for a moment, Xu Xiaoshou smiled again. He looked at the people around him:</p><p>“and people, slowly and unintentionally, will become the kind of people that they hated at that time.”</p><p>“Take me for example…”</p><p>“at this moment, I don’t care about the opinions and accusations of everyone present. In my eyes, they are just a pile of trash!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stood up with a smile and suddenly walked out of the spiritual array in front of everyone’s eyes.</p><p>In the past, I hated it when chess players played with their chess pieces. I didn’t care about the way the chess pieces played.</p><p>Now, I can roughly understand and have the capital to do so. So, when a similar predicament appears, I really want to break it on the spot!</p><p>The spiritual array appeared.</p><p>“Attention, Passive Points, + 9999.”</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, + 9,999.”</p><p>“Disliked, Passive Points, + 6,862.”</p><p>How satisfying!</p><p>Passive Points soared.</p><p>With tens of thousands of points, Xu Xiaoshou used “Young master Xu” to break the rules. At this moment, his heart was bursting with joy.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>‘The information bar jumped, and an extremely eye-catching message appeared.</p><p>“apprehensive, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>The moment Xu Xiaoshou walked out of the spiritual array, Shi Ti, who was sitting in the judge’s seat, suddenly stood up. For some reason, he shouted in shock, “Young… Young Master Xu! It’s just Conducting alchemy! What are you doing with the spiritual array? !”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
