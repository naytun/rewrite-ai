Who are you really?”</p><p>“So many semi-saint positions swallowed up, and not a single one has been regurgitated till now, where did they all go?”</p><p>“Devouring so many people, what exactly do you intend to do?”</p><p>“Do you recognize the god slayer Ran Ming, is He really dead?”</p><p>Sss…</p><p>The will of the Di Ying Holy Plant, like a lowly little snake, was pinched in The Divine’s hand.</p><p>In this place where all life had vanished, there was no existence to borrow from for revival, not even for causing pregnancy.</p><p>The inherently powerful life path of the Ancestral Tree had, after this battle, been thoroughly analyzed by The Divine using the Human Realm Dao.</p><p>Learning by nature is hard, not everyone is Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>But to obliterate such an aura of the Great Path is as simple for The Divine as cutting off water to prevent the rebirth of water-type Upanishad practitioners, thereby stopping the Di Ying Holy Plant from starting anew.</p><p>“Not speaking, no matter.”</p><p>Looking at the cringing will of the little snake in his hand, The Divine flicked off his arm’s sweat and chuckled lightly,</p><p>“Along with you, I’ll seek out the body itself.”</p><p>“No matter if you plan to hide at the ends of the earth or the seas, I can find you, believe it or not?”</p><p>Sss…</p><p>The little snake, fearful, seemed to have lost all capability to converse.</p><p>Life…</p><p>The Divine narrowed his eyes in thought, his tiger-like eyes suddenly opened wide, and the Overlord struck down.</p><p>“Beast Path · Red Bird!”</p><p>His burly body suddenly writhed, his legs curled up, transforming into sharp claws, his arms spread out, turning into fiery wings.</p><p>His skin even sprouted red feathers, turning him into a blazing flame bird.</p><p>The Red Bird, an ancient creature, roams the great path of fire, cultivates using the essence of the fierce sun, feeds on the will of living beings, hunts but does not die, consuming only their intellect.</p><p>“Screech!”</p><p>A cry rang out.</p><p>The giant bird’s red sharp beak pecked toward the will of the little snake in front of it.</p><p>The Divine clearly knew how to handle these stubborn creatures that wouldn’t speak; he had more than ten ways to make them reveal everything to him.</p><p>The Red Bird was just one of them.</p><p>Consuming this will, whatever it had experienced and cultivated, he would then know all.</p><p>But the perfect execution of the Beast Path also had side effects; it would take a lot of time afterward to forget these things that do not belong to himself, to prevent contamination of his own Great Path.</p><p>As the sharp beak was about to strike, a hiss came from behind.</p><p>“Sss—”</p><p>The voice of the Di Ying Holy Plant!</p><p>This creature, hadn’t he almost eradicated it completely? Was there still more?</p><p>The Divine was not startled but delighted. After a wriggle of his body as the Red Bird, he roared thunderously in Heavenly Dao:</p><p>“Beast Path · Bixi!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Cheng Guanglu’s fist smashed against a huge turtle shell, instantly shattering his whole arm.</p><p>“He” seemed stunned for a moment, then another harsh, heavy sound rang in his ears:</p><p>“Beast Path · White Tiger!”</p><p>As the voice fell, a tiger claw struck at his heart.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Cheng Guanglu’s entire body exploded into a blood rain, falling from the sky.</p><p>From a distance, Demi-Saint Changyi saw the terrifyingly mighty giant white tiger, his eyelids twitching crazily.</p><p>So, had he really been holding back when he fought me with just a stick, and not just holding back a little bit?</p><p>“Chi Chi Chi…”</p><p>Just then, an abrupt change occurred.</p><p>Before the blood rain could fall, it assembled in mid-air into a bizarre life diagram—resembling that Life Upanishad Formation, yet significantly different.</p><p>Quickly, a thin, gnarled tree branch emerged from it.</p><p>That branch, dark and piercing, carried flesh and soul along with it, adorned with the wailing faces of all living beings; it was profoundly eerie.</p><p>Upon appearing, it instantly broke through space and time, and pierced into the body of The Divine, transformed into the White Tiger.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>The black branch penetrated the tiger.</p><p>The Beast Path was abruptly undone.</p><p>The Divine stared down at his head, looking at the eerie branch piercing through his heart, greedily drawing the surging life force.</p><p>“Gurgling, gurgling, gurgling…”</p><p>…</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>This warning of “be careful,” Xu Xiaoshou had shouted it out when Cheng Guanglu teleported over to covertly attack The Divine.</p><p>After that, everything happened in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The Beast Path transformed three times, Cheng Guanglu was instantly killed by a strike, and the Di Ying Holy Plant’s reborn branch appeared in a baffling manner, piercing through The Divine…</p><p>“The Divine, lost?”</p><p>Even at this moment, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but conjure up this thought.</p><p>In his eyes, at this time, The Divine was almost synonymous with “unmatched”.</p><p>A crazed brute!</p><p>The ultimate crazed brute!</p><p>But only until this branch, carrying a power that surpassed all else in the embryonic divine palace before, easily breached The Divine’s defenses.</p><p>Did he finally realize…</p><p>The Divine was indeed not a god, just a person.</p><p>But the Di Ying Holy Plant was more than just that; its eeriness seemed to come from above…from the Eighteen Heavens?</p><p>“So…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, stunned, looked towards Elder Sang and Water Ghost, his mind flashing with the only unresolved question till now:</p><p>Previously in the divine palace world, Yue Gongli had mentioned that the Di Ying Holy Plant seemed to be a high-realm Holy Emperor, even possibly approaching the power of an Ancestral God.</p><p>But the power displayed was only that of a low-realm Holy Emperor.</p><p>The final performance…</p><p>Was being severely beaten by The Divine, killed all the way from the divine palace to the Divine Relics, utterly in a sorry state.</p><p>“Holy Emperor?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
