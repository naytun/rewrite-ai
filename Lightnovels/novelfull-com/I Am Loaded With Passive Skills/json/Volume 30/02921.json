But now, the number of attendees simultaneously joining surged to an astonishing three digits.</p><p>In front of an imaginary long table, were seated countless shadowy forms with indistinct faces.</p><p>Higher voids and demi-saints indistinguishable from each other; everyone has the right to speak up and everyone can express their discontent as if it were one of the few places of freedom left.</p><p>What they discussed was the “Invitation to Saint” just issued by the Holy Divine Palace which had created a tremendous stir across the five regions.</p><p>“Don’t even mention it, my family’s demi-saint went too, without any hesitation!”</p><p>“My sect’s did as well.”</p><p>“So did my faction.”</p><p>“How could they not? It’s rare for the Holy Divine Palace to extend an ‘invitation’, which means it’s officially sanctioned, without fear of pursuit or the risk of a Saint Fall… Our sanctified one has been in self-imprisonment for over seventy years; he’s become like a hermit in a cave, finally getting to stretch his legs!”</p><p>“Watch what you say! Revere the Saints!”</p><p>“Haha, relax a bit here, I’m his own grandson, so I’m not afraid.”</p><p>“Ah, does everyone in the big families have demi-saints? Am I the only head of the family here?”</p><p>“Newcomer? Then I know which family you’re from; my sect is near your family’s estate.”</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>All were huddled in their discussions, talking amongst themselves, and the atmosphere was bustling.</p><p>Until a loud voice managed to quell the ruckus of over a hundred people:</p><p>“If you ask me!”</p><p>At once, everyone fell silent and turned their attention to the source, filled with delight:</p><p>“Northern Feng, the itinerant cultivator?”</p><p>“Yo, the demi-saint is here! Didn’t Northern Feng, the demi-saint, go play in the ruins?”</p><p>“Hehe, our demi-saint wanted to invite you along, but he was too impatient and already went in. The invitation is currently being sent over by one of his subordinates, hoping the itinerant cultivator will join us inside for another gathering and drink… Uh, now that it’s been mentioned, seems like the invitation need not be sent, right?”</p><p>“Does Northern Feng, the itinerant cultivator, have any advice for us, the higher void fledglings? I’m hesitating whether I should go into Ran Ming…”</p><p>“Done! No need to hesitate, there goes another one!”</p><p>“The more you say, the more mistakes you make.”</p><p>“Misfortune comes from the mouth.”</p><p>“Come on, repeat after me, ‘God Executioner’s Ruins, the God Executioner’s legacy…'”</p><p>The arrival of the demi-saint obviously pushed the shadowy forms gathering to a new climax.</p><p>The illusory long table kept extending and began to rotate, with many more chairs added to the sides, and many more people joined.</p><p>The Heavenly Covenant does not limit the number of attendees from one faction; after all, this is the Covenant.</p><p>Sometimes, when joining in the dead of the night, you might even overhear the elites of a faction, scattered across different locations, discussing in this shadowy forms gathering about a plan to wipe out a clan that could cause insomnia just by hearing of it.</p><p>Northern Feng, the itinerant cultivator, is one of the few Spiritual Cultivation demi-saints without the burden of a family faction!</p><p>He has witnessed too many absurdities in the shadowy forms gathering, and of course, also the growth of this meeting from small to great, holding dear emotions for this place.</p><p>He is cheerful and forthright, with no airs about him, making all factions willing to befriend him.</p><p>The actual situation is…</p><p>Who would dare to offend a demi-saint?</p><p>And an itinerant cultivator who’s a demi-saint at that, outrageously so!</p><p>Thus, in the shadowy forms gathering, Northern Feng, the itinerant cultivator, holds a high regard, once coming close to the level of a covenant leader—something everyone thinks, but Northern Feng, the itinerant cultivator, dares not think.</p><p>He enjoys sharing.</p><p>This time, he joined with even bigger news:</p><p>“If you ask me, the ‘Invitation to Saint’ is a trap. I’m here to warn all families not to wade into the tumultuous waters of the Holy Divine Palace and Saint Servants just for a moment of thrill, it will cost lives!”</p><p>The people around the long table laughed in response:</p><p>“Then, itinerant cultivator, you’re too late.”</p><p>“Those who should have gone in have done so, those who won’t go in won’t be persuaded by you; after all, they’re too used to staying at home.”</p><p>“I heard it’s not just the demi-saints of the Northern Region who are unsettled. The demi-saints of the Eastern and Southern Regions are also itching to move!”</p><p>“What sort of demi-saints can the Eastern and Southern Regions have? They don’t even come close to the number of demi-saints in the Northern Region.”</p><p>“Ah? Can the places of self-imprisonment of the demi-saints in the Northern Region be described in such a refreshing and straightforward way?”</p><p>“Hahaha, those who can wrestle with the Holy Divine Palace are amazing, you can self-imprison at your own home; those who can’t even wrestle for a moment should obediently move to the Northern Region to confront the extradimensional cracks… Ah, I feel it… Red Coat ajin immortal! May the light live forever!”</p><p>“I’m feeling it too… A Northern Region person for a day, a Northern Region soul for life!”</p><p>“If you can’t leave then just admit it; no need to beat around the bush showing loyalty, save your face!”</p><p>“It’s not absolute, the Seven Breaks can take you out, the Hol Divine Palace’s hand can’t reach that far, we have examples of that here.”</p><p>“Ssst! I’m new here, and the things everyone is discussing…”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
