Great Path? Power? Past? Future?</p><p>“I don’t know…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was rarely so candid.</p><p>But he genuinely did not know what the purpose of Kong Yuhen’s existence was; sometimes he even felt that the person’s existence itself was quite ethereal and vague.</p><p>When not mentioned, it felt as if the whole world had forgotten him.</p><p>Er, that seems like a pointless statement?</p><p>But that was the feeling!</p><p>“Do you know?” Xu Xiaoshou kicked the ball back.</p><p>“I do not,” Yue Gongli also shook his head.</p><p>“Then why do you bring it up?”</p><p>“But I know, in the era of the first ancestor of my Yue Clan, there was a record of an ‘All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion,'” Yue Gongli said quietly as if revealing an earth-shaking secret.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind went blank, and his pupils dilated.</p><p>Yue Gongli’s eyes suddenly turned red, “Have you gone in?”</p><p>“Huh? You haven’t?” Xu Xiaoshou counter-asked.</p><p>“Damn! Why have all of you been in?” Yue Gongli got angry, “I am a genius too, why didn’t he invite me in?”</p><p>“Could it be that you forgot?”</p><p>“Uh…” Yue Gongli suddenly touched his chin, pondering seriously, and finally hissed, “That’s possible.”</p><p>“What’s so good about the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion that you want to get in so badly?” Xu Xiaoshou frowned.</p><p>Yue Gongli had a rather subtle expression:</p><p>“You have no idea…”</p><p>“From ancient times to the present, no matter the era, there has always been an All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion.”</p><p>“It can appear anywhere, whether it’s Abyss Island, the Shengshen Continent, or even within the Holy Emperor’s secret realm.”</p><p>“It’s said that those who can see it will see it, and those who can’t will never have the chance in their lifetime.”</p><p>“But it seems like the Ten High Nobles can all enter… um, not necessarily, the Nine Venerable Seating? I’m not sure.”</p><p>Yue Gongli shook his head to himself, “So it’s said, if one’s strength or talent reaches a certain standard, they can be invited.”</p><p>“A kind of… affirmation?” Xu Xiaoshou saw through Moon Fox’s trivial competitive spirit.</p><p>“Sort of,” Yue Gongli gritted his teeth, “I heard that Bazhun’an entered the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion when he was very small, he seemed to have gone more than once, damn it!”</p><p>That was indeed more than once… Xu Xiaoshou nodded subtly, then became suspicious, “When he was very small, you knew each other?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Then how do you know?” Xu Xiaoshou was shocked; were the first-in-command saint servant and the successor of the Holy Emperor such close friends, “Did he tell you?”</p><p>Yue Gongli shook his head again, “My big sister told me…”</p><p>He then added somewhat nervously, “Right, don’t tell anyone else, she doesn’t want me to tell others…”</p><p>Ah?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a wave of dizziness.</p><p>This answer… uh, um, odd indeed.</p><p>Yue Gongli, how to describe him—he was mature yet abstract, capable but idle, playful but with a sense of responsibility, clear in his likes and dislikes yet ambiguous in his stance but very aware of what he was doing and what he shouldn’t… uh, a child?</p><p>This was the assessment Xu Xiaoshou made in his mind.</p><p>He had come a long way and had seen many people with distinct personalities, but such a unique, contradictory character was one of a kind.</p><p>One thing he could be certain of.</p><p>Their paths would never be the same!</p><p>The topic of “Kong Yuhen” had been forgotten as they chatted, and outside the Yin Coffin, the battle between the Void Giant Master and Di Ying Holy Plant continued to shake the heavens, with a constant rumbling noise.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned to the battlefield outside, “In that case, can the Heavenly Ancestral Divine Shedding defeat the Di Ying Holy Plant?”</p><p>Yue Gongli released his saint’s will to observe the outside for a while before slowly shaking his head, “It looks doubtful.”</p><p>“How so?”</p><p>Yue Gongli was not hopeful:</p><p>“Divine Shedding is Divine Shedding, inherently possessing power unrivaled in this world.”</p><p>“But to tally up all the combat strength, having the strength of a first realm Holy Emperor is impressive enough, after all, currently, it’s just a Yin Corpse that operates on instinct, even a slightly stronger demi-saint with a brain could take it down.”</p><p>“The Di Ying Holy Plant has mutated a bit, it seems like a high-level Holy Emperor, even approaching the power of the Ancestral God, but the power it is currently displaying is somewhat lacking, only on par with my Void Giant Master…”</p><p>“Even so, since she can think, the Void Giant Master will inevitably be no match for her!”</p><p>After listening, Xu Xiaoshou sank into the previous evaluation Yue Gongli had made when seeking cooperation, about his view of the Di Ying Holy Plant.</p><p>“You said it devoured the Ancestral God Fate Chart, and it still aims for the god slayer heritage, approaching the realm of the Ancestral God?”</p><p>He was just skeptical, an intuition.</p><p>Yue Gongli gave this judgment, perhaps based on the perspective of a successor of the Holy Emperor, could he see deeper?</p><p>Indeed, Moon Fox’s expression turned grave upon hearing this, and as his saint’s will swept the surrounding underworld, he murmured:</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
