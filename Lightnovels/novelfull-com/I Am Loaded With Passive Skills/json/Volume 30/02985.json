While Kong Tong’s height was within the range of normal men, he barely reached up to the chest and abdomen of the man in front of him.</p><p>The man’s physique was even more robust, and his one arm, complemented by the heavy armor, was nearly the size of Kong Tong’s entire body.</p><p>The Snake Lady nestled against his chest, standing on tiptoes as if trying to whisper some secrets, truly resembling a seductive little snake coiling around a burly giant.</p><p>Lord Taizai Ci!</p><p>This was a man full of legends!</p><p>He came from the Northern Region, originally no different from any ordinary person, blending into the crowd and at best considered a super genius.</p><p>There were geniuses everywhere, nothing unusual about that.</p><p>After his sanctification, however, Taizai Ci unexpectedly awakened the God of War Bloodline—the “God of War” of the Northern Region War Divine Land!</p><p>The naturally occurring power of the ancestral source was highly compatible with him, elevating him to the throne of the peak of the demi-saint stage overnight.</p><p>He was called the “War Saint,” a title in the Northern Region War Divine Land second only to the ancient “God of War.”</p><p>In his hand, he held the Dragon Painting Spear, one of the Ten Great Psionic Weapons, sharing the fame of “Great Psionic Twin Spears” with the Sea God’s Trident.</p><p>The might of his God of War Armor, which manifested from the inside out after awakening the power of God of War Bloodline, was formidable.</p><p>Before The Divine created the legend “At the Gates of Hell, even The Divine is revered,” Lord Taizai Ci was once hailed as the strongest man on the Shengshen Continent!</p><p>And to this day, because the two have not yet faced off directly, who is stronger and who is weaker remains a mystery.</p><p>Such a divine personage, comparable to the Ten High Nobles, however, unlike the ordinary demi-saints longing for freedom, Taizai Ci willingly became the blade of the Holy Divine Palace governing the Northern Region.</p><p>Although it was only a nominal position, with hardly any dealings with the Holy Divine Palace on a daily basis, from that point onward, the Northern Region was essentially his territory—the Heavenly Covenant being just a loose organization.</p><p>But Kong Tong knew that a saying had been circulating among the Saint Servants:</p><p>“Lord Taizai Ci, the most loyal war dog of the Holy Divine Palace!”</p><p>To put it plainly, a mere watchdog.</p><p>Yet, it also side-handedly confirmed the close relationship between Taizai Ci and the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>He had proactively cooperated with Hallmaster Dao, studying the God of War Bloodline, the God of War’s power, and the God of War Armor, through which the Combat Division of the six divisions was established by the Holy Divine Palace, developing the Cang God Armor.</p><p>He was also the only one who voluntarily accepted orders from the Bei family of the Five Great Holy Emperor Aristocratic Families, went to Mournful Emperor Realm to cooperate in research, and managed to “survive” and “normally” return to the Northern Region as a demi-saint.</p><p>This time, upon the issuance of the Invitation to Saint by the Holy Divine Palace, Taizai Ci responded immediately, bringing out all demi-saints under his command, assembling at the Divine Ruins.</p><p>There was so much more…</p><p>In the Northern Region, there were many standards for measuring demi-saints, with some using the Northern Region Seven Stars, Twelve Holy Lords, and the like to differentiate rankings.</p><p>Kong Tong was one of the Twelve Holy Lords, and his greatest feat of strength was escaping with his life from a Holy Emperor.</p><p>It doesn’t sound impressive when spoken aloud, but in reality, he was already very strong.</p><p>Below him were the Hexagram Saints and many other demi-saint faction owners of similar rank.</p><p>Above him were the Snake Lady, the Shadow Saint, and a few other fallen ones, but desperately possessing the Power of Destroying Saint—the Ten High Nobles, Kong Tong believed.</p><p>At the highest level, there were the likes of Lord Taizai Ci!</p><p>Living longer, having more resources, without restrictions, and possessing sufficient talent…</p><p>Named a demi-saint, yet wielding the power of a Holy Emperor!</p><p>Crushing the Northern Region Seven Stars and Twelve Holy Lords would be as simple as turning over his palm!</p><p>Lord Taizai Ci was only three or four heads taller than an average person, but when the daylight shone down, his shadow was truly that of a giant, covering the entire cracked mountain range.</p><p>Kong Tong knew this was the external manifestation of the God of War’s power.</p><p>The man’s current form was merely his casual conversational state; in battle, he was a completely different person!</p><p>After arriving, Taizai Ci didn’t waste time with idle chatter. With a wave of his hand, he declared unequivocally:</p><p>“Yue Gongli has left a signal, calling for us to seek him out.”</p><p>“There’s no time to waste, Xu Xiaoshou is important, but not as important as the order of the Holy Divine Palace.”</p><p>“Let’s set aside the matter of the Hexagram Saints for now, we will set off immediately, heading to the Fate Temple.”</p><p>“Yes!” Not a single person objected, and even Kong Tong, who had lost two precious subordinates, didn’t say a word in protest.</p><p>“Hold me~” The Snake Lady coiled onto Taizai Ci’s arm, and he hoisted her onto his shoulder with one arm, without asking further questions.</p><p>She had once asked Taizai Ci, given his formidable strength, why he so readily obeyed the Holy Divine Palace—Bazhun’an was so weak and could act thus, why couldn’t we follow the example of the Saint Servant and start our own rebellion?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
