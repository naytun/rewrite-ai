With a gesture, he summoned the trembling remnants of Fen Qin’s old troops.</p><p>Behind them, the God Fated Stars were being passed along as if they were the rightful owners from the Holy Divine Palace, unafraid of any Spiritual Cultivator blocking their path in the world.</p><p>In truth, there was no longer any point in hiding.</p><p>With half of the Saint Servants gathered here, even the people of the Holy Divine Palace would have to act subservient. These folks could say black was white, and who would dare to argue?</p><p>At this moment, the only concern of Fen Qin’s old troops was whether their boss would take out his embarrassment on them.</p><p>Clearly, after so many years apart, their memories had only polished the good—overestimating the magnanimity of their leader, Fen Qin.</p><p>Elder Sang did not blame them.</p><p>Instead, he committed their faces to memory, plotting to have them “wear the little shoes” he would later craft…..</p><p>But then he thought better of it.</p><p>After all, what great tumults cannot arise in this life? Just because today is a disaster, does it mean tomorrow can’t be worse?</p><p>Looking on the bright side, by giving them leverage over him, doesn’t it offer them a traceable path for managing him in the future?</p><p>He could just walk around them.</p><p>The world does not revolve around him, and the good times and beautiful scenery are out there in the mountains.</p><p>Therefore, don’t let bad moods affect you. Tolerance and magnanimity are indeed the royal principles of social conduct.</p><p>“Don’t drive these people into Xu Xiaoshou’s camp now, there really is another worthy leader at present,” Elder Sang frowned and mused to himself.</p><p>Once everyone had gathered, Xu Xiaoshou reluctantly came over with an air of reluctance, and only then did Elder Sang wave his hand magnanimously, not trying to curry favor, and said with a smile:</p><p>“Here are six God Fated Stars, my gift to you upon our meeting.”</p><p>What about Master?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sneered internally, thinking why wouldn’t you refer to yourself as “Master” to give me a chance?</p><p>Six stars?</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s eyebrows shot up as he saw the bag in his hand that was three times smaller, and then glanced at Water Ghost, his brows and eyes moving again: How does he have six stars?</p><p>Water Ghost looked at him indifferently: Six stars are actually few.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s mouth twitched: Aren’t you just criticizing your own incompetence? The two of us fighting side by side only got two!</p><p>Water Ghost snorted and shook his head slightly: Sorry, don’t count me in. I’m just a spectator who was pulled into the game, I lack such desires.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu clicked his tongue, feeling that these Underworld Living led such meaningless lives, filled with scheming at every turn. He then faced his old chess friend Elder Sang, who was urgently signaling with his eyes and eyebrows, and flattered indifferently:</p><p>“Wow, six, that’s a lot.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed and, looking at the God Fated Stars passed over from behind Elder Sang, also flattered:</p><p>“Wow, six, just one less than my seven.”</p><p>Is that it?</p><p>You think this will make me forget what just happened?</p><p>Keep dreaming, old man Sang, either Master or Godfather, you choose!</p><p>Elder Sang could obviously hear the irony in his disciple’s tone and glared at Cen Qiaofu, “What about yours?”</p><p>Mine is mine, I have high talents too, and I would like to try for the Ancestral God Fate Chart… Cen Qiaofu pouted, but then took out the God Fated Stars and handed them to Xu Xiaoshou, “Here, for you.”</p><p>“Ah, thank you Senior Cen, I appreciate the kindness and will repay you generously one day!” Xu Xiaoshou bowed solemnly, making a solemn promise.</p><p>You! Elder Sang opened his mouth, but in the end, he could not produce a sound as his lips twitched.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu gave a slight tilt of the head and a minimal shrug of the shoulders, his eyes seemingly saying: There’s nothing I can do; your disciple is too cunning. I wanted to give you this favor, but the person in question won’t acknowledge nor accept it!</p><p>Elder Sang’s teeth gnashed: Couldn’t you have given it to me first, so I could give it to him?</p><p>Cen Qiaofu: You should have said that earlier!</p><p>What’s going on, what’s happening… Xu Xiaoshou’s hesitant gaze flowed back and forth across the faces of these old Saint Servants, and he couldn’t help asking, “Do you all have your own set of secret codes?”</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>Water Ghost sucked in a breath of cold air, stepping back slightly and immediately withdrawing from the silent battlefield.</p><p>Luckily he had been wary of this young man and hadn’t communicated too deeply.</p><p>“Ah? Language? What language?” Cen Qiaofu scratched his head in confusion, puckered his lips as if about to whistle, but stopped when Elder Sang glared at him and instead began toying with the little axe around his waist.</p><p>You’re very busy… Xu Xiaoshou found it unbearable to ridicule further and lost interest in deciphering their language. Accepting the items, he said bluntly:</p><p>“Not enough.”</p><p>Including his own seven, Elder Sang’s six, and Cen Qiaofu’s two, that made a total of fifteen God Fated Stars.</p><p>Three more were needed to exchange for the Ancestral God Fate Chart.</p><p>Of course, Elder Sang knew very well what his disciple’s “not enough” really meant, and after a silent fit of clenching his teeth, he also pretended not to understand, looking towards a figure in the distance:</p><p>“Palace Master Bai Zhou, we need three more.”</p><p>Swish, swish, swish…</p><p>Suddenly, everyone who was still standing around hoping for a miracle also looked at the purple-haired beauty.</p><p>Palace Master Bai Zhou?</p><p>It was only then that everyone realized that this was the figure from the Ancestral God Ranking, the leader of the Xu Yue Grey Palace.</p><p>But…</p><p>Wasn’t it said…</p><p>That he was a man?</p><p>Under the gaze of tens of thousands, Palace Master Bai Zhou tipped the gourd and filled his mouth with liquor, then spread his legs and planted one on a large rock, belching loudly.</p><p>“Burp…”</p><p>Only then did he shake a little and manage to pour out three God Fated Stars from the gourd:</p><p>“You saved my life, and I’m grateful for that.”</p><p>“But just short of these three God Fated Stars in my hand, I can’t simply hand them over to you.”</p><p>Elder Sang stepped forward, about to speak.</p><p>Palace Master Bai Zhou shook his head; his face flushed as if he had drunk too much but still seeming quite lucid:</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
