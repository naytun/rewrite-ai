Swish!</p><p>Both passed through Kong Yuhen, as if everyone was in a different spacetime.</p><p>The Yin Coffin carried the two geniuses far away, while Kong Yuhen seemed to pass through something inexplicably, and the Ancestor Tree Branch continued to chase the coffin, fiercely poking and violently pulling as if it hadn’t seen anything.</p><p>“Save us!”</p><p>“Don’t go—”</p><p>In that instant, Kong Yuhen hesitated.</p><p>He heard his friend’s call for help, and he came.</p><p>He watched a scene unfold, realizing that he wasn’t entirely necessary.</p><p>He now wondered whether the best choice was to turn around and leave?</p><p>Kong Yuhen didn’t hesitate for long before he stepped back, his form becoming illusionary…</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>Space made a grating sound, and time also seemed to rust and couldn’t turn anymore.</p><p>Kong Yuhen’s figure froze in place.</p><p>The Yin Coffin was pulled from afar, the coffin lid barely able to stay shut; the twisted voice inside grew from soft to loud as it passed in front of them:</p><p>“No, it seems like Xu Xiaoshou’s friend is about to give up on us?”</p><p>“Brother Anxiety—”</p><p>Amid the thunderous noise, the coffin was pulled away again.</p><p>Kong Yuhen frowned and took another step back.</p><p>“Crack.”</p><p>It was still that grating sensation.</p><p>This time, a sudden realization of misfortune hit him.</p><p>Easy to enter, hard to exit?</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>Suddenly, a person emerged beside him.</p><p>In less time than it took to teleport, he was drained dry, a higher void, a demi-saint?</p><p>No one was visible!</p><p>Kong Yuhen’s complexion was no longer rosy, turning three shades paler.</p><p>The voice from inside the Yin Coffin was pulled over again: “Xu Xiaoshou, what kind of friend have you made? He really wants to leave!”</p><p>“Don’t worry, it seems he can’t leave anymore…”</p><p>“Eh, why has he stopped?”</p><p>Yes, the Yin Coffin had stopped.</p><p>The Ancestor Tree Branch had also stopped, as if pondering, frozen mid-air.</p><p>Kong Yuhen inwardly sensed trouble; he had tried twice, at first she hadn’t noticed his presence, but now she had?</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>Billions of branches, all at once, turned and aimed in Kong Yuhen’s direction.</p><p>“Friend…”</p><p>Kong Yuhen reached out his hand, instinctively shifting to the side as the dense mass of Ancestor Tree Branches made anyone watching anxious.</p><p>But it was no accident!</p><p>The Ancestor Tree Branches accurately confirmed his location, following him with a shift, still aimed at him!</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>Kong Yuhen reached back with his hand, and an illusory three-story pavilion appeared.</p><p>He chuckled lightly, without a change in expression he stepped back three times, placed his hand on the wooden door, and pushed hard.</p><p>“Whoosh.”</p><p>A wave rippled through the air.</p><p>The grand door of the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion didn’t open for him, its owner.</p><p>“Ah~ Oh~”</p><p>From inside the Yin Coffin came a confused and puzzled voice, “Isn’t he one of the Ten High Nobles? What is he afraid of?”</p><p>“…He, isn’t fully a Ten High Noble?”</p><p>“I am not afraid,” Kong Yuhen turned back to the coffin and said with a smile. Then, looking toward the depths of the dark formed by the black branches:</p><p>“This gentleman… I am just passing by, if it’s convenient, may I ask you a question before I go?”</p><p>Swish!</p><p>The billions of Ancestor Tree Branches together tilted to one side, eerily as if someone were tilting their head.</p><p>A low voice emanated from the Yin Coffin:</p><p>“He understands the art of language, does he really want to slip away?”</p><p>“Don’t interrupt, Moon Fox, the Di Ying Holy Plant seems to be wary of something too, she really stopped!”</p><p>“Wary of what? Wary of Kong Yuhen? Xu Xiaoshou, are you joking?”</p><p>“…You know nothing.”</p><p>The two chatterboxes clearly didn’t disturb Kong Yuhen.</p><p>Facing these eerie endless branches, at this moment, the desire for knowledge overrode the thought of retreat, and Kong Yuhen truly asked the question he had always posed to others:</p><p>“Please tell me…”</p><p>“Who am I?”</p><p>Swish!</p><p>The Ancestor Tree Branches clearly hesitated for a moment.</p><p>Kong Yuhen, seeing a chance, had a flicker of joy in his expression, and said:</p><p>“May I ask, do you know me?”</p><p>“Or rather, have you heard of the name Kong Yuhen, and his story?”</p><p>That very instant, the last moments on Abyss Island flashed through Xu Xiaoshou’s mind—Kong Yuhen’s appearance and his query to the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit, the very same question, “Who am I?”</p><p>To that, the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit had answered:</p><p>“Thou art also trapped…”</p><p>Trapped by what?</p><p>To this day, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know the continuation.</p><p>But now, he was equally eager for the Di Ying Holy Plant’s answer; perhaps, the Ancestral Tree would recognize Kong Yuhen?</p><p>But!</p><p>In response to this question!</p><p>The answer from the Di Ying Holy Plant was…</p><p>“Sssiiii—”</p><p>That wailing sound echoing from all directions was clearly laughing, mocking, taking pleasure in another’s misfortune!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression changed.</p><p>Yue Gongli’s expression changed.</p><p>Kong Yuhen’s expression drastically changed.</p><p>Because…</p><p>“Swish, swish, swish!”</p><p>Those endless dark branches, following the wildly conceited laughter, as if affirming something, no longer hesitated or doubted, all fiercely stabbing towards the surrounded Kong Yuhen at the center, without mercy!</p><p>“Sizzle!!!”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
