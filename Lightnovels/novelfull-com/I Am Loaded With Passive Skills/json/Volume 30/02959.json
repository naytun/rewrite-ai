Why do I still need to use my brain?</p><p>“Chief Elder, what do you think?” Xu Xiaoshou looked to the side.</p><p>Posing as contemplative but actually in a daze, the advanced slacker ghost hesitated, touching his golden beast mask, with a finger pointing at himself:</p><p>“Me?”</p><p>“Who else but you, my dear Chief Elder?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>As everyone turned their eyes toward him, the Water Ghost wanted to decline, but upon catching the sly look on Xu Xiaoshou’s face, he hastily said:</p><p>“I think it’s entirely unnecessary!”</p><p>“Oh?” Xu Xiaoshou laughed. “How so? ‘Entirely unnecessary’?”</p><p>You don’t need to say another word!</p><p>The Water Ghost glared venomously at the youngster before turning back to the topic at hand, his face taking on a more serious tone:</p><p>“As for whether to invoke the Ancestral God Fate Chart, now that the initiative is in our hands, we can completely slow down the pace.”</p><p>“We’re currently in the First Heavens, but we haven’t visited the Eighteen Heavens or the Thirty Three Heavens above, nor have we learned of potential opportunities there.”</p><p>“Yue Gongli has already gathered fourteen God Fated Stars and teamed up with Huang Quan, it seems he also wants to make a sprint for it.”</p><p>“Opportunities coexist with risks. In my case, the risk outweighs the opportunity, so let him try.”</p><p>“And…”</p><p>Pausing, the Water Ghost swept his gaze over everyone, stopping on Xu Xiaoshou:</p><p>“If it were someone else, I wouldn’t say this.</p><p>“But if it’s you and we consider the inheritance of the god slayer as positive gain, you might try the first step, ‘Super Taoization.’</p><p>“If the inheritance proves false and the gains are negative, we still have The Divine to cover our retreat, with an extremely high margin for error.” He looked towards the distant battlefield.</p><p>“If we can’t ‘clearly discern me, Super Taoization, Feather Ascension Three Realms, and see the true name,’ we’ve still got our safety net, and it wouldn’t be too late to be try then.” He looked down at the eighteen God Fated Stars on the ground.</p><p>Well done, well done!</p><p>Water Ghost, you really do have a brain, speaking so articulately.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally experienced a little of the joy of Bazhun’an, and following Water Ghost’s speech, he turned his gaze to Elder Sang.</p><p>Unaware of anything, Elder Sang began to speak as he pondered:</p><p>“Correct, I also agree with Water Ghost’s view.”</p><p>“Also, you arrived late and might not yet be aware.”</p><p>“Our people have already visited a treasure location in the Ruins before, and we saw the records of the ‘Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar’ on a stone tablet.”</p><p>“Yes, I remember Yue Gongli’s people were there too,” said Water Ghost, his eyes lighting up, clearly also entering a state of reflection.</p><p>So like Cen Qiaofu and Bai Zhou, Xu Xiaoshou swayed like a stalk in the wind, tilting his head toward Water Ghost’s side as he listened to him:</p><p>“With ten God Fated Stars, the ‘Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar’ can be summoned to ascend to the Upper Realm, namely the Eighteen Heavens above our heads.” He pointed upwards.</p><p>“We couldn’t gather enough before to test it.”</p><p>“Now that even the Ancestral God Fate Chart can be summoned, we might as well check out the difference between there and here before… Theoretically speaking, the risk there is smaller, and the opportunity greater.”</p><p>“That’s exactly right!” Elder Sang nodded vigorously, causing his opinion—like three blades of grass on a wall—and countless others behind him, to swing over to his side:</p><p>“However, theoretical risks are just that—theoretical. Actually summoning the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar might not be safer than summoning the Ancestral God Fate Chart.”</p><p>“At least if I were a demonically transformed god slayer… no, if I were any other ill-intentioned person, a unidirectional path would be the easiest to ambush.”</p><p>“Yue Gongli must also know this and he knows what we’re thinking; hence, he’s even more anxious than us!”</p><p>“For the successor of the Holy Emperor, whether the Ancestral God Fate Chart is real or fake is not important. Because even if there’s a slight chance that it’s false, Yue Gongli cannot afford to wager on it; he cannot accept the Fate Chart falling into outsiders’ hands.”</p><p>“Therefore, he must keep the item in his own possession, but he’s currently lacking in the number of God Fated Stars, and one could say that the First Heavens have become our territory…”</p><p>“Sleeveless is right!” Water Ghost agreed with a laugh, and the many listeners behind him, who couldn’t quite understand but felt it to be very impressive, turned their gazes towards him again:</p><p>“The rules of the Divine Ruins are special; we can determine Yue Gongli’s position through the Ancestral God Ranking.”</p><p>“He must know this, yet he has no choice.”</p><p>“Even if he has someone else hold the God Fated Stars, we’re not foolish. We’d know it’s him behind the scenes, so he’s chosen to play his cards openly.”</p><p>“It’s not by choice; he has to show his hand!” Elder Sang corrected the slip of the tongue, knowing too well what Water Ghost was saying, meeting the gaze of the audience as he continued:</p><p>“We are now the initiators, the chess masters.”</p><p>“Yue Gongli, unwilling as he may be, must become a piece under our watch, a piece that must walk the path we dictate.”</p><p>“There’s no need for us to act; we just need to keep following him.”</p><p>“Exactly!” Water Ghost smiled. “He on the other hand must move cautiously forward, unable to retreat, having to madly explore, and using the lives of the people from the Holy Divine Palace to mitigate the risks associated with venturing into the unknown, the very traps that he has dug himself.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
