You see, trouble comes out of the mouth. Now, I reckon about ten factions must be panicking, “May I know who your Excellency is?”</p><p>“This saint is Pei Zai.”</p><p>“The Leisurely of the Northern Region Seven Stars, the Leisurely Demi-Saint Pei Zai, Demi-Saint Pei?” The Northern Winds Hermit was taken aback and his speech carried a hint of respect, “Aren’t you on the front line…?”</p><p>“Just returned home for a short rest.”</p><p>“Ah, good to rest, good to rest. Ah, yes, the feeling I was talking about earlier is…”</p><p>The shadowy gathering erupted into chatter.</p><p>The Leisurely Demi-Saint, this figure was as famous as the War Madman Changyi the Demi-Saint; both were notorious killers most frequently seen on the battlefields at the front lines of the extradimensional space!</p><p>The Northern Region Seven Stars, perhaps seldom heard of on the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>But that’s because these seven demi-saints are perennially mired in the battlefield, with no time to make an appearance.</p><p>Why was the Heavenly Alliance established?</p><p>Not because a group of people needed a place to chat idly like dried fish, but because the initial front line battlefields required a space for immediate communication.</p><p>Thus, in the endless rotation of the Higher Void World and under the proposal of the Heavenly Alliance Leader, those seven bosses constructed it along with a team of architects from the Higher Void.</p><p>The Northern Region Seven Stars were the first members of the Heavenly Alliance.</p><p>Back then, the Heavenly Alliance was the true covenant, inheriting the fierce spirit of the Northern Region War Divine Land!</p><p>Today’s Heavenly Alliance…</p><p>Well, let’s not speak of it.</p><p>As the old saying goes, “Without the Seven Stars guarding the front line, where would the peaceful land of Yu Lingdi be found?”</p><p>This is an assessment.</p><p>An interpretation of the current idle state of Heavenly Alliance.</p><p>An explanation for the peaceful world of the other four domains behind the front line battlefields.</p><p>And the highest compliment to the Northern Region Seven Stars!</p><p>And now…</p><p>From the words of Leisurely Demi-Saint Pei Zai, another of the Seven Stars, the War Madman Changyi, has already entered the Ran Ming ruins to intercept Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>No!</p><p>He said “they”…</p><p>Perhaps many battle-tested demi-saints from the front line also wish to take a breeze through the Ran Ming Ruins?</p><p>The Northern Winds Hermit is also a demi-saint.</p><p>As a demi-saint, he can boast when compared to ordinary demi-saints; after all, becoming a saint as an itinerant cultivator is a beautiful legend in itself.</p><p>But when compared to demi-saints like those of the Northern Region Seven Stars, it’s a difference as vast as between Jiang Buyi and the Ten High Nobles; they are not to be mentioned in the same breath.</p><p>After hesitating for quite a while, the Northern Winds Hermit ended up completely forgetting the “feeling” he was about to discuss, unable to utter half a sentence.</p><p>“No need to feel anymore!”</p><p>Just then, at the head of the shadowy gathering’s long table, a blurry figure materialized.</p><p>“I’m shocked!”</p><p>“What day is it today?”</p><p>All the people at the side of the long table exploded at once.</p><p>How many years had it been since this figure appeared?</p><p>The leader of the Northern Region Seven Stars, the primary pillar of the front-line battlefield, the very founder of the Heavenly Alliance…</p><p>“`</p><p>“The Alliance Leader has arrived!”</p><p>“What do I see, Alliance Leader Yan Sheng?”</p><p>“Welcome Alliance Leader Yan Sheng! May the Heavenly Covenant prosper for thousands of generations and unite…”</p><p>“Shut up, don’t just spout flattery, do you want to die? If the Alliance Leader really found out that the Heavenly Covenant he once established by himself had turned into such a state… Cough! I didn’t say anything, I’m from the Liyue Sect.”</p><p>“We’ve seen the Alliance Leader!”</p><p>“Greetings to the Alliance Leader Boss!”</p><p>Respectful voices rose from the side of the long table, suppressing the sycophancy that had been thick during the meeting, each person seeming very upright, as if they were all direct descendants of the God of War.</p><p>The itinerant cultivator of the Northern Wind scratched his somewhat numb scalp.</p><p>It really was just like the saying, what day is today, what kind of wind could blow all these Bosses back from the front lines?</p><p>“Alliance Leader, may I ask what you meant by ‘no need to feel anymore’?” the itinerant cultivator of the Northern Wind hesitantly asked, sensing a trap within the question.</p><p>The Leisurely Demi-Saint Pei Zai also looked over, equally curious but silent.</p><p>Alliance Leader Yan Sheng, equally faceless, made everyone feel his gaze sweep over the participants before he spoke with an extremely grave tone:</p><p>“The God Executioner’s Ruins, there’s been a serious problem.”</p><p>“Everyone must immediately return home, report to the demi-saints of their factions, and must not enter the Ruins.”</p><p>“Remember, this is a ‘Heavenly Alliance Order’, those who violate it shall be executed!”</p><p>Hiss—</p><p>A series of sharp intakes of breath resounded from below.</p><p>The Heavenly Alliance Order was only issued when the situation at the front lines was extremely dire, wasn’t it?</p><p>The itinerant cultivator of the Northern Wind felt his voice wavering slightly: “May I dare to ask…”</p><p>…</p><p>“Boss, what happened?”</p><p>At the Divine Relics, an information operative from the old divisions of Fen Qin, looking at the figure that had stopped in its tracks, hesitantly asked.</p><p>“See for yourself.”</p><p>Elder Sang stood quietly, his expression full of darkness.</p><p>Those behind followed his gaze and saw nothing but a battlefield in the distance, full of the traces of reckless destruction by Spiritual Cultivators.</p><p>Lightning-type spiritual source, metal attribute spiritual source, water-type…</p><p>Broken spiritual weapons, garments, Magic Beads, the usual severed limbs, and remnants…</p><p>Clearly, there had been a massive battle here, with an estimated thirty or forty people fighting to leave so many corpses behind.</p><p>The crowd looked and looked again, but couldn’t find anything out of the ordinary: “Boss, what exactly is the problem you mentioned?”</p><p>Their main focus was still on taking turns transmitting the God Fated Star, how could they spare any thought to find fault?</p><p>Indeed, they had already left the volcano.</p><p>For some reason, Boss Fen Qin had suddenly taken a whim, saying he wanted to go out to find someone.</p><p>Going out on his own was one thing, but he had taken everyone with him, flaunting all the God Fated Stars in the open.</p><p>It was as if… his head had been kicked by a donkey…</p><p>But this was Fen Qin Zhu He, the Sleeveless Saint Servant, and when he commanded, they followed without question.</p><p>What they saw was certainly only the surface.</p><p>The Boss must have his own thoughts!</p><p>Elder Sang solemnly withdrew his gaze: “We should not have come out…”</p><p>He looked out into the distance.</p><p>Occasionally, some figures flew by in the distance.</p><p>Just like those they had encountered on the road from afar, everyone’s destination seemed very consistent, heading to the same place…</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>As soon as Elder Sang spoke, everyone behind him buzzed in confusion, “What do you mean?”</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Elder Sang said no more, his figure flashed, appearing in the midst of the chaotic rock pile left from the aftermath of battle.</p><p>The people behind hurried to keep up.</p><p>Looking from outside the battlefield was different from inside.</p><p>At least.</p><p>The stench of blood was undeniably stronger by several degrees!</p><p>These scattered limbs and corpses were oddly shaped, adding a few degrees of eeriness…</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>Everyone’s pupils suddenly trembled, looking at the blood and corpses on the ground, their faces filled with boundless horror.</p><p>“Corpses?”</p><p>“The Ran Ming ruins, how could there be corpses?”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
