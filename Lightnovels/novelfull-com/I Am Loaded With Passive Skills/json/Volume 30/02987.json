Think you can fathom them?”</p><p>“Demi-saint…”</p><p>That comment sent quite a few into deep thought; someone sighed, “Actually, we’re all just half a step away, aren’t we?”</p><p>The atmosphere fell quiet for a moment, a somber shade crossing everyone’s faces.</p><p>Hadn’t they all dreamed?</p><p>Between a Higher Void practitioner and demi-saint, isn’t it just a half-step difference?</p><p>But that half-step represents the heavenly chasm that one’s whole life may never be able to bridge—Semi-Saint Position!</p><p>In their youth, everyone had dreams, thinking that with one bold struggle, they could possibly earn a Semi-Saint Position, even if just barely.</p><p>Now in a blink of an eye, they realize that years have been squandered, stuck in the Higher Void State for decades or even centuries, achieving nothing significant.</p><p>Dreams are like carrots dangled in front of donkeys, eternally out of reach.</p><p>Once settled in comfort, with no thought for change or daring to become a transcendent, that’s how life remains.</p><p>“Stop feeling nostalgic!”</p><p>Soon someone spoke up with a laugh, pointing to the distant calamity cloud, “Someone else is trying to achieve sanctification, a Fire Saint… If you think about it, you could all rush forward just like him.”</p><p>“Us? How could we possibly?”</p><p>The others came back to their senses one by one, shaking their heads and smiling bitterly.</p><p>Here, they were all old men, past the time for spring sadness and autumn sorrow, so how could they easily be emotionally swayed again?</p><p>Now, as they looked at the Sealing Saint calamity cloud, what they saw wasn’t the opportunity they had longed for all their lives but an enormous risk of death!</p><p>The Divine Relics had been open for some time now. Even back in the First Heavens, people were achieving sanctification from time to time.</p><p>Initially, everyone rushed forward to join the excitement, wishing to observe the process of sanctification and learn some experience for future emergencies.</p><p>Little did they think, they were all deluded dreamers.</p><p>Without even finding a Semi-Saint Position, they sought what they thought could serve as substitutes—treasures—and began to transcend the tribulation.</p><p>And the result?</p><p>Naturally, they perished, one by one.</p><p>With the Divine Relics open for so long, there was only one successful case of sanctification.</p><p>Back then, there were even fewer observers, and that person didn’t even find the Sealing Saint opportunity inside the relics but brought in a Semi-Saint Position from outside.</p><p>Saint Servant, Cen Qiaofu!</p><p>“Counting this one, I’ve witnessed twenty-eight attempts to transcend the tribulation. That means the twenty-seventh overly hopeful soul from the Higher Void State is about to be born.”</p><p>“Ah, wrong, even the soul will dissolve.”</p><p>As everyone gazed toward the distant saint calamity, the envy in their eyes was hard to endure.</p><p>The step they dared not take, someone else took.</p><p>Even if the outcome was failure, the courage was admirable, yet paradoxically, they were reluctant to see others succeed.</p><p>Thus, envy and admiration eventually turned into sour jealousy.</p><p>“There are always those who dream big dreams of flying up to become a phoenix.”</p><p>“And only when they fall and bleed do they know regret, but by then it’s too late.”</p><p>Some had a different opinion:</p><p>“That fire calamity seems quite intense; the one transcending it now doesn’t seem to be just any Higher Void practitioner?”</p><p>“Who among those who have achieved Higher Void State could be ordinary? No matter how strong his saint calamity is, could it be supreme saint calamity? I’ve seen the Water Ghost transcend the tribulation myself!”</p><p>That claim turned saint calamities less impressive; everyone looked over and someone laughed, “So, what do you think, compared to Water Ghost’s supreme saint calamity, how does this one stack up?”</p><p>“No comparison. That one is an Upanishad demi-saint!”</p><p>“But this one isn’t weak either; I think it’s many times stronger than other calamities transcended by Higher Void practitioners… and this is just the aura we feel from this distance, it must be even stronger on-site.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“See, Mr. Tan has nothing to say. I told you this saint calamity was unusual; it really seems to have something.”</p><p>As everyone looked back at the saint calamity, they couldn’t help but note its strength.</p><p>Not much could be seen from such a distance, but the aura felt was not something any ordinary person could invoke.</p><p>“Old Tan, you’ve seen the Water Ghost’s sanctification; come on, rate this calamity, out of ten.”</p><p>“I… indeed, now that you mention it, by aura alone, it does not seem inferior to the supreme saint calamity.”</p><p>“What? You’re serious? I was just joking!”</p><p>“But it also depends on the situation,” Tan explained quickly, “The Water Ghost was at Sky City back then; the rules there can’t compare to those of the Divine Relics here…”</p><p>“Right, Divine Relics are a higher tier, their saint calamities stronger; even if this fire calamity seems strong, it might be just average if done on Shengshen Continent.”</p><p>Old Tan looked worried: “Maybe…”</p><p>All at once, he felt a familiar fierce and domineering aura from the fire-type saint calamity—why did it seem familiar?</p><p>But before he could voice his doubt, the ground shook, and an immense Holy Energy pressed down upon them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
