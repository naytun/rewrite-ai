The three rounds of Body, Spirit, and Will take this long?</p><p>“That Moon Fox…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paused mid-sentence, not waiting for an explanation, he quickly raised his left hand, and as soon as his spiritual senses made contact, the Ancestral God Ranking popped out:</p><p>“One, Xu Xiaoshou, eighteen.”</p><p>“Two, Yue Gongli, eighteen.”</p><p>“Three, Taizai Ci, one.”</p><p>“Four, Hua Yuan, one.”</p><p>“Five, Rao Wangze, one.”</p><p>“Six, Cao Erzhu, one.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Protracted silence.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gazed at the Ancestral God Ranking.</p><p>Elder Sang, Water Ghost, Cen Qiaofu, and others just looked at him.</p><p>There were fewer people around, the remaining ones all looked towards these leading Saint Servants.</p><p>Only Bai Zhou still paced impatiently back and forth, his restless “tap tap” footsteps making the quietness more profound.</p><p>After a long while, Xu Xiaoshou spoke up, jokingly saying, “Cao Erzhu came by? He’s my friend!”</p><p>“Hmm.” Cen Qiaofu tightened the small axe at his waist, “He came to see you, saw you were cultivating, didn’t disturb you, yelled something ‘are there not men of honor and ambition,’ then ascended to the Feather Ascension Upper Realm…”</p><p>“What?” Xu Xiaoshou was startled and wanted to ask more.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu said all he did, seeming to have more to say, but before he could speak, he was sent back with a glance from Water Ghost.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally noticed that something was off about the atmosphere, and he looked back at the Ancestral God Ranking’s second place, going straight to the point:</p><p>“The Moon Fox also accumulated eighteen God Fated Stars?”</p><p>“Do you have such big eyes just for sleeping?” Elder Sang retorted.</p><p>“This Taizai Ci…”</p><p>“Ai Cangsheng is no weakling, and Divine Relics are just places he can’t leave, you can consider him as the most capable demi-saint for now… Hmm, he probably gathered ‘a group of demi-saints’.”</p><p>“Then this Hua Yuan…”</p><p>“No doubt, Yue Bei Hua Rao Dao.”</p><p>“This Rao Wangze… what! Rao Wangze… Wangze Holy Emperor?!”</p><p>“Heh, Ancestral God Fate Chart, has always been the Holy Emperor’s most coveted, didn’t you foresee this?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou once again fell silent.</p><p>Looks like you’ve become quite sharp-tongued now?</p><p>Elder Sang, however, was all smiles as if the names on the list were indications of great joy. Seeing that Xu Xiaoshou had stopped asking, Elder Sang chuckled and added:</p><p>“They are all waiting for you.”</p><p>“Are they all people of the Holy Divine Palace?” Xu Xiaoshou still couldn’t believe that so much could happen in seven days.</p><p>Elder Sang laughed heartily, “Isn’t Lord Shou usually quick-witted? How come today you open your mouth only to ask nonsense?”</p><p>You!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost yelled out that you are simply Defying the Heavenly Gang, then remembered, perhaps he was the one who was the apprentice.</p><p>It seems my face wasn’t slapped hard enough earlier, eh? Not bad, No Clothes·Red Burned Body, you’re up and hopping again?</p><p>Never mind, he’s old, I’ll let him have his way…</p><p>“Did you eat gunpowder, why so snappy?” Xu Xiaoshou just muttered to himself.</p><p>“Wasn’t snappy, now moderately snappy,” replied Elder Sang, his expression returning to calm, no longer grinning.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but let his gaze drift from the Ancestral God Ranking in his hand, looking up.</p><p>With this glance, he saw not only Elder Sang, even Water Ghost had a gloomy expression.</p><p>The Saint Servants and near Saint Servants gathered around all hung their heads as if weighted down by spirit stones on their shoulders.</p><p>His wisecracking comments got stuck in his throat, for a moment speechless.</p><p>Isn’t this scene reminiscent of the behavior displayed by the subordinates behind Yue Gongli back then — Change in Feng Shui?</p><p>“Was I wrong?”</p><p>Suddenly, Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he might have made a mistake.</p><p>If at that time, I had firmly tried to keep The Divine and united everyone’s strength to kill Yue Gongli, then perhaps these many changes would not have occurred now, right?</p><p>Elder Sang rarely shook his head, this time not retorting against this rebellious apprentice:</p><p>“Yue Gongli is not so easy to kill.”</p><p>“Anyone can make mistakes, but your choice of seven days, absolutely not!”</p><p>Water Ghost strongly agreed with these words.</p><p>No matter the cost paid, it was nothing compared to what Xu Xiaoshou gained from this Enlightenment.</p><p>Insight is not to be interrupted, for if it is broken, it is lost, a widely known fact amongst all Spiritual Cultivators.</p><p>Things also haven’t reached an irreparable state.</p><p>Because in the worst case, they still had the last resort of waking Xu Xiaoshou up.</p><p>Fortunately, it didn’t come to that.</p><p>…</p><p>“Holy Emperor…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou squinted, “Perception” scanned the despondent people around again and noticed that, indeed, many had left.</p><p>Perhaps during the days of my Enlightenment, more people had continuously departed from this place, seeking fortunes.</p><p>The remnants were either part of Elder Sang’s old Fen Qin forces, or Saint Servants and unfamiliar faces from the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>He felt there was something more peculiar, which he couldn’t quite pin down!</p><p>“The Wangze Holy Emperor shows up and you all manage to live?”</p><p>This casual question brought everyone to a halt, and even Elder Sang did not respond immediately.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyelids twitched, realizing something was amiss, and he looked sternly at Water Ghost:</p><p>“Rao Wangze shows up, and you still manage to live?”</p><p>Water Ghost’s mouth twitched slightly: “Why would the people of the Holy Divine Palace still be alive under your watch?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes suddenly widened with realization.</p><p>So, seven days later, had the Holy Divine Palace turned the tables, using the Saint Servants as pawns?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
