This is one of the Great Psionic Weapons, the Yin Coffin.”</p><p>“Let’s set aside its other abilities, at least in my hands, you have no chance of breaking its defenses.”</p><p>“Now, can we calmly have a talk?”</p><p>The people on the edge of the battlefield looked on.</p><p>Zhou Tianshen caressed her belly as she looked on.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes widened, the same ridiculous thought flashing through their minds simultaneously…</p><p>“Is he threatening Lord Shou?”</p><p>The next second!</p><p>A shocking sight!</p><p>They saw Lord Shou, in the form of the Golden Giant, relentlessly kicking down after Yuegong Li’s voice stopped.</p><p>“Boom boom boom boom boom boom!”</p><p>The ground was blasted open!</p><p>The Yin Coffin was hammered into a deep underground pit!</p><p>With the Berserk Giant at the center, the battlefield kept collapsing downward after every stamping kick…</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>In the midst of the booming sound, Yuegong Li’s voice became frazzled:</p><p>“Don’t mess with me… brother!”</p><p>“It’s shaking… shaking me!”</p><p>“Damn! Stop kicking…it’s pressing down on me!”</p><p>“Stop! Stop! STOP—”</p><p>Everyone held their heads, their scalps tingling from the sight.</p><p>Zhou Tianshen sucked in a breath of cold air: “I said the size was off, it would slip…”</p><p>A tiny human inside the giant’s coffin, wouldn’t they be shockingly killed by the immense force?</p><p>Hearing the cries, the Berserk Giant mercifully ceased its cruel actions.</p><p>A breath of air with a hint of relief came from Yuegong Li: “Xu Xia…”</p><p>The sentence wasn’t finished!</p><p>To the astonishment of everyone watching, the giant began to shrink and bent over, thrusting its hands into the ground.</p><p>The gray-blue Yin Coffin was suddenly hoisted from the earth, held high above!</p><p>“Hey! Hey! Hey…”</p><p>Shaky cries emanated from within, carrying a sob: “Don’t mess around, don’t mess around… ah!”</p><p>Bam!</p><p>The Berserk Giant swung the Yin Coffin violently, bending it, shattering space, shattering the ground.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>A sound of blood spurting came from inside.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Berserk Giant swung again, the Yin Coffin moved in a semicircular arc from left to right in the air, crushing the space to the right, the earth as well.</p><p>“Save…me…”</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Another swing to the left.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Another swing to the right.</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
