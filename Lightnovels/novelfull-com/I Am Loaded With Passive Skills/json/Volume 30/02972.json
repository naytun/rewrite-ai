I hadn’t anticipated it involved the Holy Emperor’s Guidance and the power of oblivion.”</p><p>“This is somewhat related to ‘Spirit Awakening.’ It seems that the formation of the Will Dao Disc is not unrelated to ‘Disillusionment Finger.'”</p><p>“So, my gradual desensitization to the power of guidance and oblivion isn’t just because of my increased cultivation level and higher passive skill grades, but also due to the Will Dao Disc that had grown from resisting various Holy Emperors’ guidances and oblivions?”</p><p>This traces back too far into ancient times.</p><p>During his time in the Spirit Palace, Xu Xiaoshou received a considerable amount of “unconscious” guidance.</p><p>From Elder Eighth, Elder Sang, the Great Infernal Ancestor, Hallmaster Dao, Bei Huai…</p><p>Time and again, others shaped “me,” leading to the rapid formation of my thoughts and consciousness.</p><p>If one were to investigate this Will Dao Disc, it already touches on discerning “myself.”</p><p>So…</p><p>“Is this the reason I could see Kong Yuhen?”</p><p>The formation of a 90% Will Dao Disc enabled Xu Xiaoshou to comprehend many things in a short time.</p><p>Kong Yuhen must also possess a vast amount of ‘intent,’ having forgotten ‘myself,’ and thus has been constantly searching…</p><p>Looking back, despite significant gains, the cost was also extremely expensive.</p><p>“Passive Points: 224892.”</p><p>Tens of millions of Passive Points, peaking at eighty or ninety million, almost a hundred million, after continuous expenditure, had finally dwindled to a meager two hundred thousand.</p><p>Two hundred thousand, thrown into the Way of the Sword Disc, wouldn’t even make a splash.</p><p>Compared to the current expenditures of tens or hundreds of millions of Passive Points, it is essentially equivalent to the early zero Passive Points.”</p><p>“Finally…”</p><p>In a daze, Xu Xiaoshou ended his reflection and opened his eyes.</p><p>I’ve become poor.</p><p>But stronger!</p><p>…</p><p>“He’s awake!”</p><p>Everyone had been eagerly waiting.</p><p>When that mysterious, incomprehensible Power Upanishad Formation also broke through its limits, reaching a step of unknown boundary,</p><p>Lord Shou opened his eyes.</p><p>Everyone suddenly felt a weight lift off their chests.</p><p>“My goodness, you finally opened your eyes, letting him wake up, it truly couldn’t go on anymore!”</p><p>Yet another transcendent… Even the Water Ghost stared blankly at the gradually dispersing Power Upanishad Formation beneath Xu Xiaoshou, her expression shifting from initial surprise to numbness now.</p><p>It seems the Ten High Nobles of this world existed just to suppress such a genius.</p><p>Being reborn as Xu Xiaoshou was to challenge the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>Who could defend the throne desperately seized back then, when this rising star is on the verge of his final charge?</p><p>“You’re awake?” Elder Sang looked at his disciple affectionately.</p><p>“Otherwise, what? My good disciple.” Xu Xiaoshou stood up and blinked, indicating his eyes were not for sleeping while open.</p><p>“Heh heh…”</p><p>Elder Sang turned his head back, fiercely gritting his teeth at the air, then turned back with a chuckle to his defiant disciple, “Did it succeed?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glared back, his mouth just beginning to move.</p><p>“Forget I said anything.”</p><p>Elder Sang hastily waved his hand.</p><p>He now felt even speaking was scalding.</p><p>After many years, Elder Sang doubted whether his own verbal skills had been stolen after taking on a disciple.</p><p>This kid, how can he be so exhausting?</p><p>“How many days did I sleep?”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou spoke, he looked into the distance, noticing the dim light of the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar, where not just Yue Gongli, but no one from the Holy Divine Palace could be seen anymore.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
