Mother, Yue Gongli Secretly Gives Birth.</h1><p>Chapter 2915: Chapter 1535: Xu Xiaoshou is intent on the mother, Yue Gongli secretly gives birth.</p><p>“Ah—”</p><p>A sharp scream rose from the distant rear of the Dark Forest, filled with panic and terror, startling birds with swollen bellies to fly from the treetops.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew what Yue Gongli was screaming about.</p><p>Looking down at his belly that had swollen yet again, he almost wanted to scream himself.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Another sword cognition cut down, and the Dao Infant vanished.</p><p>On his way here, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know how many times he had manually terminated his own ‘pregnancy.’</p><p>He could tell that the recurrent swollen belly was not the original intention of the will he had previously detected in this Dark Forest.</p><p>It was simply that after entering deeper into this forest, such were its rules and the influence of the remaining forces, that it naturally came to pass.</p><p>Just like planting melons will yield melons, planting beans will yield beans.</p><p>Daring to venture deep into the Life Forest naturally came with consequences.</p><p>Even if that will had retreated to the innermost parts, and the grey-black boundary line was shrinking further and further… it was too strong!</p><p>The ‘Power of Reproduction’ left by more than 80% of the Life Dao Disc far surpassed any ordinary Upanishad demi-saint, even stronger than Xu Xiaoshou himself!</p><p>“Perhaps…”</p><p>“This already involves ‘Super Taoization’ mentioned by the god slayer Ran Ming—Not present, yet becoming the Path, omnipresent and eternal?”</p><p>“Has the Di Ying Holy Plant transformed into this Dark Forest?”</p><p>“Indeed, the Ancestral Trees might have had this idea, possessing the talent, courage, and the spiritual intelligence to do so, being in the Ran Ming ruins and also wanting to dabble in the god slayer’s legacy?”</p><p>This train of thought was so wildly imaginative that its underlying logic was full of holes and couldn’t withstand scrutiny.</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts reached this point, and he surveyed the Life Forest around him, he frowned:</p><p>“But this seems too limiting, merely this area is far too small for an Ancestral Tree.”</p><p>“If it has become the Great Path, the entire Ran Ming ruins should have been ‘polluted’ by the out-of-control Life Great Path.”</p><p>“That is to say, either it partially failed in Super Taoization, which is difficult to imagine since even I don’t dare to rush the Mang Great Dao Disc, or…”</p><p>“Or its disgusting ability has been stopped by something, perhaps limited by rules, possibly due to the insufficient level of the Three Heavens here, or maybe even Ran Ming, feeling disgusted, took strong measures.”</p><p>“Alternatively…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyes in the Dark Forest and looked up towards the sky.</p><p>The silence around him was deafening, the sky was dim, and the truth was obscured, adding to an air of concern.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>Another pregnancy terminated.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickened his pace, heading toward the deepest part of the Dark Forest where the covert sword cognition had also stopped when he had been previously attacked.</p><p>As he hastened, he analyzed the situation and didn’t forget to leave traces for the Corpse Queen to follow.</p><p>Based on the strength of the Six Marrow Corpse King provided by Yue Gongli, Xu Xiaoshou was decidedly unwilling to engage with this giant creature.</p><p>It wasn’t fear of losing—he had plenty of trump cards—but there were no benefits to winning.</p><p>If he lost, or was caught off guard, he might be forced out of the Arena.</p><p>With this in mind.</p><p>Why fight at all?</p><p>Zhou Tianshen’s strategy must be broken, and six God Fated Stars are already in hand.</p><p>Yue Gongli’s strongest move to eliminate competitors—Nian—couldn’t even break his passive defenses.</p><p>He miscalculated.</p><p>Had he known this, he would have planted Nian around Elder Sang, Cen Qiaofu, Huang Quan, or Bai Zhou, and he might have reaped rewards.</p><p>Misstep the first move, and the rest shall follow suit.</p><p>Therefore, the ones who should be in a rush now are Yue Gongli and the Holy Divine Palace, not Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>So…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou still pressed on toward the Dark Forest, but for what purpose?</p><p>First, to secure eighteen God Fated Stars and exchange for the Ancestral God Fate Chart—he had to get it.</p><p>Having already cut off Yue Gongli’s path, with the Holy Divine Palace on the brink of collapse and the majority of the God Fated Stars with him, Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t in a hurry to look for more.</p><p>Even if Yue Gongli had other tricks up his sleeve and other factions were still concealing their strengths, Xu Xiaoshou believed that Elder Sang wouldn’t just sit idly by.</p><p>His confrontation with Nian and Yue Gongli outside the Dark Forest would certainly spread far and wide, even if the news of him forcefully entering the Ancestral God Ranking first and securing seven God Fated Stars hadn’t done so already.</p><p>People would come to know.</p><p>Those who should come, will come.</p><p>Those who shouldn’t, will also come.</p><p>Is Xu Xiaoshou afraid?</p><p>Joke!</p><p>In the past, Elder Sang used him as a chess piece to enter the White Cave, disrupt the grand scene, seize the famed sword Flame Python, inherit the Holy Emperor’s Intent, take over the situation on Abyss Island, draw upon the power of the Four Divine Pillars, battle the Wangze Holy Emperor, defeat the Holy Divine Palace, and even Hallmaster Dao envied him, all but one fatal mistake…</p><p>Man in the Dead Sea, scheming to overturn the whole world.</p><p>It can be seen that behind the successful layout of Bazhun’an, there loomed a cunning old man who dared to take risks.</p><p>Today, Xu Xiaoshou also dared to use Elder Sang as a chess piece to balance other factions.</p><p>He didn’t believe Yue Gongli was devising schemes around Zhou Tianshen without Elder Sang noticing.</p><p>And after so long, with Yue Gongli even managing to get the Corpse Queen ‘pregnant,’ it was telling that Elder Sang hadn’t sent a “reminder” yet.</p><p>With his capabilities, upon leaving the Dead Sea and entering the ruins, even with only higher void level cultivation level, he would definitely have connected with Cen Qiaofu and the Water Ghost and other demi-saints for support, starting his own game.</p><p>The second-in-command saint servant, taking along the fourth and fifth holders of the position to join the game.</p><p>Would these people be lacking?</p><p>While Cen Qiaofu’s cunning had yet to be fully revealed, his demi-saint level combat strength was certain.</p><p>Moreover, this man, who could transcend the tribulation overnight, was actually considered a crazed man by the saint servant!</p><p>In charge of plunging into the front lines of the Eighth Palace battlefield, starting a dominant group battle, then breaking off to hold his ground, one man to guard the pass, unstoppable by thousands.</p><p>In charge of slashing his way into the Four Symbols Secret Realm frontline battlefield, cutting and hacking all the way, bringing flames and lightning from transcending the tribulation in the Four Symbols Secret Realm to the Ran Ming ruins, oblivious to the concept of ‘cowardice.’</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
