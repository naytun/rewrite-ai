Cursed Yin Evil God!”</p><p>Power of the evil god surged wildly from his body, gathering behind him like a virtual image, a Saint Statue, forming a ferocious giant monster.</p><p>The monstrous giant, enormous as it covered the sky, had three heads and six arms, its body covered in purple fur, its face blurred, and its roar terrifying enough to turn one into a nightmare.</p><p>“Chi—”</p><p>Accompanied by a shrill cry, purple smoke invaded thousands of miles around.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally understood why the power of the evil god in Di Ying Holy Plant had no effect on Yue Gongli.</p><p>He also understood why this guy was born with a Dao Infant and possessed perfectly balanced Power of Three Ancestors.</p><p>He truly wielded such quality and quantity of the power of the evil god!</p><p>This “Cursed Yin Evil God” was many times more formidable than the evil elders and Ghost Granny combination among the gold hunting token assassins he had seen before!</p><p>“Contamination of Evil Epidemic!”</p><p>Yue Gongli struck a palm into the sky.</p><p>The gigantic purple-furred monster, the Cursed Yin Evil God, followed with a palm strike.</p><p>“Boom—”</p><p>The purple smoke spread like a plague.</p><p>The moment the Ancestor Tree Branches touched it, they immediately shrank back, their life force entirely contaminated, reduced to zero.</p><p>However…</p><p>It was just a moment.</p><p>“Hiss—”</p><p>From the depths of the darkness, the excited, hunger-thirsty cry of the Ancestor Tree sounded, and more branches shot from midair.</p><p>“Xu! Xia! Shou!”</p><p>Yue Gongli exploded.</p><p>Not just his temper exploded, but he himself nearly did too.</p><p>But at this moment, he was helpless; after all, within the embryonic form of the divine palace of the Ancestor Tree, if he kept this up, the fate of becoming the Void Giant Master awaited him.</p><p>“Called, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Why call me?</p><p>The moment Xu Xiaoshou activated the Ultimate Giant and then Acalanātha, he turned into a turtle shell.</p><p>I have a whole arsenal of passive skills, what should I fear?</p><p>That’s a joke!</p><p>The Di Ying Holy Plant was afraid!</p><p>It was afraid of the pain and no longer wished to clash against this hard nut, shifting all branches towards Yue Gongli, leaving Xu Xiaoshou more than happy.</p><p>Fight, fight…</p><p>“Chi Chi.”</p><p>Just then, the Ultimate Giant’s body began giving off steam, and the startled voice of the Water Ghost came:</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, run, I saw her true body!”</p><p>Her true body?</p><p>Whose true body?</p><p>After a moment of confusion, Xu Xiaoshou slowly recalled the image of the majestic, maternal Tree of Darkness he had seen upon entering the depths of the Dark Forest.</p><p>Had the Di Ying Saint come after them?</p><p>How enticing must Yue Gongli be? She hadn’t pursued earlier, but once the Cursed Yin Evil God was invoked, even the tree couldn’t resist moving its roots?</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>The Water Ghost, Cen Qiaofu, and Bai Zhou hurriedly shouted as they dashed through the legs of the Ultimate Giant.</p><p>But under Acalanātha, thoughts moved remarkably slowly.</p><p>Only when the tree branch beside him trembled, seemingly ready to exert force, did an idea flash through Xu Xiaoshou’s mind:</p><p>“What if she decides to sustain the recoil damage from Acalanātha to absorb me completely?”</p><p>The image of the Void Giant Master’s supple corpse flickered and passed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou instantly dispelled Acalanātha, threw his arms wide open, and tore through the tree branches to start running.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Behind him, the outline and shadow of the maternal body of the Di Ying Saint became visible.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Water Ghost, Cen Qiaofu, Bai Zhou, and the others had already fled thousands of miles away.</p><p>The Cursed Yin Evil God of Yue Gongli, though thundering loudly, was ineffective in action, having lifted and carried him, who was most jubilant in his escape.</p><p>I am the one left hanging at the back, acting as the defensive tower!</p><p>“Rumble, rumble, rumble…”</p><p>The Ancestral Tree was chasing from behind.</p><p>The higher voids, demi-saints, and giants were running ahead.</p><p>Yet, the distance was closing relentlessly. Once the Di Ying Saint had locked its target and decided to shift its position, it had no intention of sparing anyone!</p><p>“Take the easy way out.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a step forward, rushing in front of the Cursed Yin Evil God, about to use a spatial teleportation trick on it.</p><p>“Snap!”</p><p>He was frozen into an ice sculpture in an instant.</p><p>Water, Cen, and Bai swiftly overtook the two scheming giants.</p><p>“Hiss!!!”</p><p>The hungry growls of the Di Ying Saint were now inches away, as if one could even smell its possibly non-existent rancid saliva.</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>At this critical moment,</p><p>a figure of a Reverser suddenly appeared in the dark path ahead, walking leisurely towards them.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>As he walked, he tossed something.</p><p>In the darkness, a streak of fire cut through the air, briefly illuminating this nascent divine palace.</p><p>The flame passed beside the Cursed Yin Evil God, grazing the knee of the Ultimate Giant.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fixed his gaze.</p><p>Though tiny, he saw it.</p><p>It was a heavy staff, gilded at both ends, with a dark brown center.</p><p>The reason for the flame was not spiritual source; it was purely the excessive speed of the throw, which tore through the air and space, forming a fiery arc of thunder.</p><p>“What is that?”</p><p>The thought had just flashed through his mind.</p><p>Thud!</p><p>The heavy staff was driven into the ground.</p><p>Suddenly, the entire embryonic Dark Divine Court trembled as if a tremendous weight had plummeted from the heavens, with Ancestor Tree branches snapping all around, scattering to the ground.</p><p>“Pop, pop, pop…”</p><p>The Di Ying Saint ceased its pursuit.</p><p>The Cursed Yin Evil God stopped its flight, and the Ultimate Giant also halted.</p><p>The Water Ghost, Cen Qiaofu, and Bai Zhou stood still, each looking somewhat stunned as they gazed at the figure who was shrinking the land with each step, approaching steadily.</p><p>Until a bald man passed everyone, passed the giants, and arrived in front of the staff, gently pulling it out.</p><p>A deep voice broke the silence of the court:</p><p>“Everyone, fall back behind me.”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>1 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p><p>1</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
