It was refined with the Power of Divinity you saw…”</p><p>Upon hearing this, a jolt went through Xu Xiaoshou’s heart.</p><p>He remembered Li Fugui once casually mentioning the origins of the Holy Palace and brought up something:</p><p>The Holy Ancestor’s legacy, or rather, the most original Power of Divinity on the Shengshen Continent, was preserved.</p><p>It was split into two parts: one in the Holy Divine Palace and one in the Holy Palace.</p><p>Could it be…</p><p>Yue Gongli, did he go so far as to use that thing to refine the corpse?</p><p>As his thoughts churned, Yue Gongli’s incessant chatter from within the Ying Coffin continued, not just explaining but also defending his actions:</p><p>“You disturbed it, it woke up, I dare not come out, so naturally it had to go—you wouldn’t expect me to confront it inside the coffin, would you?”</p><p>“I told you before, I warned you, so it’s not me who wants to hurt you, it’s not that I want to let the tiger out to injure people, I’ve always been well-intentioned towards you.”</p><p>“But now, we can’t stop even if we want to, you have to let it have its fun. Beat it satisfactorily, beat it into submission, knock it out, then I can take it back… and then we can sit down and have a proper discussion about cooperation.”</p><p>“I’m also not afraid to tell you, this Corpse King, although it has only six marrow, is no longer just the strength of one of the Great Psionic Weapons after I’ve worked on it, as for the specific level… Heh, I don’t know either…”</p><p>The more Yue Gongli spoke, the more excited he became, his words from within the coffin made him seem even more deranged.</p><p>He appeared to be eagerly anticipating a fistfight between Xu Xiaoshou’s Golden Giant and his Six Marrow Corpse King—a superb manly brawl!</p><p>But he wasn’t finished speaking…</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>As seen by the saint’s will, Xu Xiaoshou anointed his feet and took off towards the Dark Forest.</p><p>Inside the Yin Coffin, Yue Gongli abruptly stopped, then stiffened like a zombie.</p><p>Ran away? You ran?</p><p>No, how could you run?</p><p>Yue Gongli was baffled, shouting:</p><p>“Fight me!”</p><p>“Just a moment ago you were smacking me, hitting me, flinging me around, keep it going!”</p><p>“My Corpse King isn’t strong, have a brawl with it, let it enjoy itself just once, otherwise I can’t lock it back in!”</p><p>Roaring, roaring, roaring!</p><p>The Six Marrow Corpse King slammed his chest furiously, as if it were terribly uncomfortable there.</p><p>After clawing a few times, he finally managed to pull out the small black sword that was embedded in his heart and casually tossed it towards the coffin in front of him.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The Corpse King’s casual throw was incredibly violent!</p><p>The Yin Coffin was completely blasted into a deep pit in the earth by the Fourth Sword’s Recoil, which then flicked the sword body mid-air.</p><p>“Clang—”</p><p>It turned into a black rainbow, chasing into the Dark Forest, heading straight for its owner, Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Everything, had become quite improper!</p><p>“Roar roar roar!”</p><p>The Corpse King found the small flying sword quite amusing.</p><p>However, that was too small after all. It lowered its head, more interested in the larger coffin suited for the Corpse King’s physique.</p><p>Using one hand and one foot, it hooked and worked to pull the Yin Coffin out of the ground and lifted it high…</p><p>“Hey hey hey!”</p><p>The voice of Yue Gongli was clearly panicked.</p><p>Strange, this scene, why does it seem familiar?</p><p>“Bang bang bang bang bang!”</p><p>The next breath, the Six Marrow Corpse King, like paying homage to Buddha, swung the Yin Coffin and pounded it to the ground.</p><p>The more he pounded, the more refreshing it felt.</p><p>The more refreshing it felt, the more he pounded.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>“Roar ha ha ha!”</p><p>“Roar woo woo woo—”</p><p>With Yue Gongli inside, his brain was nearly evened out by spinning, only able to let out some incoherent “ugh ugh ahh ahh” noises.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Only at the end, a curse was hurled out.</p><p>The Six Marrow Corpse King’s body radiated a great amount of dark, yin-blue color. It froze as if encased in ice, and its movements stopped.</p><p>“Are you sick!”</p><p>No one around, the low curse of Yue Gongli came out: “Go find him, thrash him, go beat Xu Xiaoshou, I am your owner!”</p><p>The Six Marrow Corpse King was briefly bewildered, then looked towards the Dark Forest.</p><p>“Bang bang bang!”</p><p>He threw down the coffin and with large strides, rolled and scrambled into the thick of the Life Forest.</p><p>“Take me with you!”</p><p>The legless Yin Coffin hopped in place a couple of times, and the angry curses came again, “Idiot! Take me with you!”</p><p>The Six Marrow Corpse King stomped on the ground, leaped up, and with a suck from the Heart of Marrow Absorption on his rib side, he remotely fetched the Yin Coffin and clamped it between his legs.</p><p>Under his crotch, the Heart of Marrow Absorption opened its Big Mouth, emitting a greedy noise:</p><p>Hiss…</p><p>“You’re going to infuriate me to death!”</p><p>Yue Gongli almost shoved open the coffin lid to “play possum.”</p><p>Before he could say more, the Corpse King, clutching the coffin with hands instead of feet, invertedly crawled away, clearly crossing the grayish-black boundary of the Dark Forest, which was already retreating and obviously not eager to join the holy battle.</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>Behind the Yin Coffin, Yue Gongli’s cursing ceased mid-sentence, clearly catching onto some tricky power too.</p><p>“Damn Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>He finally realized why that sly brat didn’t use space attributes to escape but chose to run with his legs instead…</p><p>Am I setting loose the tiger to harm others, and you’re driving the wolf to devour the tiger?</p><p>“Corpse King, retreat!”</p><p>It was too late!</p><p>The Six Marrow Corpse King curiously raised its head, looking at its own belly.</p><p>All six of its Heart of Marrow Absorptions sucked ceaselessly, drawing in an endless life force, yet unable to digest it…</p><p>“Huo?”</p><p>The Corpse King curled up its feet, gently caressing its gradually swelling belly. On its pallid face, where only a Heart of Marrow Absorption sat in place of facial features, it gained a hint of life’s ruddiness, along with the tender compassion of a mother’s love.</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
