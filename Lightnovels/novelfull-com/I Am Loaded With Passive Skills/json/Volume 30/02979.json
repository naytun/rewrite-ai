Iron Turtle’s mouth gaped open, unable to focus his eyes.</p><p>At that moment…</p><p>“Reverse retreat!”</p><p>The hitherto silent Verbal Spiritual Spell-sayer suddenly opened his mouth.</p><p>With this utterance, it seemed as if a divine light had shone; he spoke, and time reversed!</p><p>The Fengdu Sword withdrew.</p><p>The elder’s soul body was pieced together again.</p><p>The gate of h*ll forcibly closed, and the Way of the Sword Disc returned to its origin.</p><p>“What is this thing…” Xu Xiaoshou hadn’t seen such bizarre ability before; today truly opened his eyes.</p><p>In the world of spiritual cultivation, nothing is impossible.</p><p>Those capable of becoming Saints each have their strengths; this saying isn’t without merit.</p><p>This teamwork of six was evidently honed by countless trials, coming into battle with brains prepared.</p><p>As time reversed, the shocked expression on Iron Turtle’s face was wiped clean, clearly an act.</p><p>Turning around, he threw his tremendous turtle shell into the sky, enlarging to the point of blocking out the sun.</p><p>“Black Sky Cover!”</p><p>With a rumble, the turtle shell descended, enclosing the person within into a separate world.</p><p>Simultaneously, the square-faced elder with the heavy sword unsheathed the greatsword behind him, his thick brows furrowing, his voice thunderous.</p><p>“Xuan Zhen Ting Sword!”</p><p>One hand seal was cast, and from the Nine Heavens thunder descended, taking form as a massive thundering greatsword colored in black and red, directly plunging into the turtle shell, aiming straight for Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Soul-binding!”</p><p>The elder hastily picked up a crimson rope from the ground, swung it into the air, and with a fierce tug, remotely bound Xu Xiaoshou’s soul body.</p><p>“God Destruction Spell!”</p><p>Fu Jiu, who had been silently holding talisman paper, flung out a talisman, determined to directly execute Xu Xiaoshou’s will.</p><p>“Frost Heart Leaf!”</p><p>Ye Xiao with a flick of a finger, evolved thousands of flying leaves within the turtle shell world, embodying various emotions such as joy, sorrow, anger, fear, all slicing towards human desires.</p><p>“Freeze!”</p><p>Verbal Spiritual Spell uttered another word.</p><p>In that same instant, just as Xu Xiaoshou was about to react, he felt a disconnection from the Great Path all around him.</p><p>His physique, soul, and intention, all frozen in place, were forced to harshly receive such terrifying attacks.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Thunderbolt Piercing Body, Soul-binding Red Rope, Curse Killing Intent, Flying Leaf Heart Scrape!</p><p>At the same time, a quadruple attack detonated, each reaching the peak of their paths; under the heavens, no demi-saint could barely handle such enforced aggressive assault—almost certainly a fatal scenario!</p><p>“Rumble, rumble, rumble…”</p><p>The Turtle Shell World violently shook.</p><p>The Central Hexagram Saint, having not combined forces for a long time, no longer knew who under heaven could withstand their attacks and survive.</p><p>That Xu Xiaoshou with his utterly exceptional Sword Spirit Body, they had only heard of him, not knowing the actual strength of the real person, but theoretically speaking…</p><p>The elder silently waited for three breaths: “He should be dead.”</p><p>The turtle shell shifted.</p><p>The inside world roiled crazily!</p><p>Suddenly, Iron Turtle’s expression drastically changed, and he swore loudly:</p><p>“He’s not dead, retreat!”</p><p>Immediately, all six simultaneously burst back.</p><p>The elder couldn’t help but turn around to check, “I clearly severed his soul, chopped into three parts!”</p><p>Zong Jianfeng said, “His physique is destroyed, completely charred!”</p><p>Fu Jiu: “His will is deeply sunken, never to return.”</p><p>Ye Xiao: “His thoughts and desires, long since perished.”</p><p>Verbal Spiritual Spell, with a grim face, couldn’t hold back, and exclaimed, “Break the Fantasy Sword Technique!”</p><p>Crack—</p><p>The space around shattered like broken glass.</p><p>Iron Turtle, the elder, Fu Jiu, Ye Xiao, and Zong Jianfeng, all had their expressions change dramatically: “What?”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The space crumbled.</p><p>What just happened seemed all illusory.</p><p>Now, what fell in everyone’s vision was merely a wall of flesh that pierced the sky, and vaguely on the ceiling of this flesh wall was a gigantic… fingernail?</p><p>The elder fell silent for a moment, struggling to look upward.</p><p>With saint’s will scanning, he saw a gigantic foot, ankle, leg hair…</p><p>It took him a while to move from the shin to the knee.</p><p>And at that moment, above the sky, the Ultimate Giant had passed through the clouds, bending down, its massive eyeballs akin to moonfall staring down.</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>Panic surged, the elder’s pupils shook violently, his voice hoarse with exertion, “What on earth is this?”</p><p>After questioning himself, information about Xu Xiaoshou flashed through his mind—he’s the Ultimate Giant who hand-tore the Holy Emperor!</p><p>“Iron—Turtle—”</p><p>Almost everyone was retreating explosively, all shouting, only Iron Turtle, compelled to bravely face the wind.</p><p>Against the wind, he could also reverse the situation!</p><p>Watch me!</p><p>Iron Turtle picked up that massive turtle shell, fiercely slamming it onto the Ultimate Giant…_RSPV</p><p>“Snap.”</p><p>The world, stalled.</p><p>Iron Turtle?</p><p>Little Turtle!</p><p>With one fingertip poking down like a heavenly pillar pressing down, Iron Turtle hurriedly covered his head with the turtle shell.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
