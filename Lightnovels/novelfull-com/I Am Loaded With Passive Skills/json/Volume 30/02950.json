Once the enemy is afraid and retreats, the path, it’s made available.”</p><p>In the moment when the divine palace shattered, darkness welcomed the dawn, and even the murky sky over God’s Relics appeared so fresh. The air itself tasted sweeter.</p><p>Yue Gongli was silent without a word, yet those words just spoken flashed through his mind.</p><p>It was when The Divine’s fame was rising that he, in jest, interviewed the bald man as a bard. The man’s answer was calm and serious.</p><p>He was as calm as he is now, beating up the Di Ying Holy Plant.</p><p>But Yue Gongli vaguely remembered the scene at that time:</p><p>The Divine, holding hands with the woman unknown to the world, stood tallest in the bustling crowd, a head or two above everyone else.</p><p>The accompanying interview was in fact dragged along forcefully, and there was also a fortune-teller who boasted of telling fortunes but in reality, only paired couples.</p><p>This gentleman was less known than The Divine at the time.</p><p>Only Yue Gongli knew how dirty the fortune-teller’s heart was, having played with him since they were young.</p><p>He glanced at the fortune-teller and asked The Divine, “What if you encounter an invincible illusion array, a ghost-hitting-the-wall kind where you can’t find your way out, how then would you carve out a path?”</p><p>The Divine was still calm, the freshly initiated man steadied his heart like a boulder weathered over ten thousand years by wind and rain, and replied:</p><p>“You just kill.”</p><p>Yue Gongli was not satisfied, and pressed further, “What if that array is rarely seen in the world, or say, far surpasses all the spiritual arrays in the world?”</p><p>The Divine calmly replied:</p><p>“Nothing on earth can confine me, what’s one array to speak of?”</p><p>After saying this.</p><p>The fortune-teller’s eyes rolled to the sky in exasperation.</p><p>The woman in The Divine’s arms nestled tenderly, with adoration twinkling in her eyes.</p><p>Yue Gongli found it amusing and turned to the fortune-teller, “What do you think?”</p><p>“What do I think?” The fortune-teller didn’t even need to make any calculations, and blurted out, “I wish them everlasting happiness!”</p><p>Later, well…</p><p>Everything came true as said.</p><p>After the War of the Ten High Nobles, the dead were gone, the survivors lived on, and they all became famous.</p><p>The Divine became the most powerful man.</p><p>Xiang Yaoyao became the happiest woman.</p><p>The pretentious Dao Qiongcang realized a transition from nothing to grandeur, finally gaining the recognition of his family at the cost of being stripped of his right to research, eventually taking the seat he both craved and despised the most.</p><p>He became a man full of contradictions, flamboyant yet odd, showy yet restrained.</p><p>Everyone shone brightly on their own paths.</p><p>“Only I…”</p><p>Yue Gongli touched his chest, gazing at the flickering light in the distance where the divine palace had shattered, his expression forlorn.</p><p>Only he, after the exposure of his imposture as a Cold Palace Emperor Realm practitioner, was personally caught by his real practitioner big sister and brought back to the clan to be punished with the ruthless and cruel needle whip.</p><p>Upon going out again.</p><p>All had changed.</p><p>He, Yue Gongli, had become the widely revered Red Coat Ruler of Dao.</p><p>Yet The Divine remained as before, just like decades ago—calmly arrogant.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“There’s a bit of change.”</p><p>Yue Gongli quickly shook off the sentimentality and gazed into the distance heavily, following everyone’s footsteps towards the main battlefield.</p><p>The Divine had grown stronger.</p><p>Among the Ten High Nobles, he certainly claimed two thrones by force, but that did not mean he could comfortably sit on the “first in combat strength” throne.</p><p>On the contrary!</p><p>Those believed to be stronger than The Divine in popular opinion, if not countless, were at least quite a few.</p><p>Those former high nobles who hadn’t been seen for decades, now returning today, The Divine could chase after the Di Ying Holy Plant. What about the others?</p><p>What will happen to the Shengshen Continent’s skies when they too break free from their restraints?</p><p>…</p><p>No longer in the divine palace, Yue Gongli blended into the crowd following the direction of the battlefield, now surrounded by a raucous atmosphere:</p><p>“The Ancestral Trees! Those are the Ancestral Trees!”</p><p>“I’ve seen them in the paintings of our clan, that’s the Di Ying Holy Plant, the very reason why the Cheng Family could rise was that our ancestors had once obtained the Dao Fruit from an Ancestral Tree!”</p><p>“And the one chasing the Ancestral Tree…”</p><p>“The Divine! The one who was called a god at the gates of hell!”</p><p>“Good Lord, he’s so fierce! I personally participated in the War of the Ten High Nobles back then and had a distant encounter with The Divine. He was nowhere near this ferocious.”</p><p>“Ah? You’re a boss who participated in the war of the Ten High Nobles?”</p><p>“Hehe, from a distance… At that time, he punched me out of nowhere; now that I think about it, I’m also someone who’s touched that Supreme Sovereign’s seat…”</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The battlefield was still intensely heated.</p><p>The Heavenly Dao God The Divine pounded the Di Ying Holy Plant at its roots and crushed it into powder.</p><p>Half of the Ancestral Tree was extinguished, and the remaining tree canopy with a human face was almost scrambling to escape.</p><p>The six thickest branches of that half which were like tendrils no longer dared to confront the Overlord’s might head-on. They transformed into spider legs to crawl away like a dog that had fallen into water.</p><p>The Heavenly Dao God The Divine, relentlessly pursued.</p><p>“The Divine is this strong?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was increasingly astonished as he watched.</p><p>On one hand, he was shocked at the prestige of the Saint Servant Nine Thrones, markedly elevated countless times by the efforts of this single man.</p><p>On the other hand, he couldn’t help but think:</p><p>“The War of Ai Cangsheng…”</p><p>Indeed, before he entered God’s Relics, a War of the Ten High Nobles had taken place here.</p><p>It was said that the fight was apocalyptic, with no victory discernible even after several days.</p><p>In the end, it concluded absurdly with Ai Cangsheng’s suicide.</p><p>The world might believe Ai Cangsheng conceded defeat.</p><p>Yet the outsider Xu Xiaoshou knew, The Divine was without his limiter Aunt Xiang, while Ai Cangsheng gained an encumbrance, Dao Xuanji.</p><p>Thus, that war ended without a result.</p><p>And no result was the worst news there could be!</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>2 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p><p>2</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
