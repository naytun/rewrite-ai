Giant Master Creates A Sky Realm</h1><p>Chapter 2931: Chapter 1540: Mutual Win-win Is Nonsense, Void Giant Master Creates a Sky Realm</p><p>Mom?!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was as stunned as a wooden chicken.</p><p>He knew nothing about what was happening in the outside world, being in the underworld.</p><p>But what was happening before his eyes…</p><p>This was too abstract, wasn’t it?</p><p>You’re a successor of the Holy Emperor, and you call a tree “Mom”?</p><p>“Moon Fox, don’t scare me!”</p><p>His steps seeking to cooperate came to an abrupt halt, and he turned his head and quickly fled in the opposite direction.</p><p>It was too eerie.</p><p>It didn’t matter whether Yue Gongli was born from a tree or if he called out that word after being controlled…</p><p>It wasn’t important.</p><p>Both essentially were terrifying!</p><p>Perception revealed that when this “Mom” was mentioned, many were startled, not just him.</p><p>The endless black branches that composed the tsunami also paused for a moment, as if the Di Ying Holy Plant was stunned too, pondering when it had acquired such a big “child.”</p><p>“Swish.”</p><p>Seizing the moment, Yue Gongli’s knees glided back as if greased, skillfully retreating backward while swiftly getting up and rushing to Xu Xiaoshou’s side.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was startled by his burst of speed, thinking the guy was controlled by the Di Ying Holy Plant, coming over to take him down, and slapped him across the face.</p><p>Yue Gongli ducked by lowering his body and tapped his temple, lowering his voice, “She can think.”</p><p>Think…</p><p>What think?</p><p>Wait a second!</p><p>You are not controlled?</p><p>So, you knelt down and called out “Mom” just to test if she could think?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s head buzzed as he wondered if Yue Gongli also had a system that made him stronger whenever he acted crazy?</p><p>But this was too much!</p><p>“While at it, scare her a bit, get my revenge, I can’t just be chased for nothing, right?” Yue Gongli said as he summoned the Yin Coffin from the darkness, ran towards it, and with a nimble kick, flipped the lid open.</p><p>He dove in like someone slipping under a blanket, rolled into the coffin, and then disappeared through the crack.</p><p>He knew the drill.</p><p>Caught in the final moment, the Six Marrow Corpse King, beaten past recognition, squeezed itself flatly in, clearly scared for its life.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The coffin lid closed.</p><p>Yue Gongli’s muffled voice was trapped inside: “Many are after me, she is the scariest one…”</p><p>?</p><p>Everything happened in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had a big question mark lighting up in his mind.</p><p>He was just confused by “She can think” for a second, and Yue Gongli had completed his self-imposed isolation.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou seemed to understand why, outside the Dark Forest earlier, despite his speedy attack, Yue Gongli could still stuff himself into the Yin Coffin.</p><p>Too skilled, aren’t you?</p><p>Do you get beaten up every day?</p><p>But…</p><p>“Why get into the coffin to wait for death, instead of running?”</p><p>Being chased.</p><p>It’s better than huddling in a shell and taking a beating, isn’t it?</p><p>Is the Yin Coffin that strong, confident enough to withstand the Di Ying Holy Plant’s attack?</p><p>Even if it could…</p><p>An example set by the previous one is a lesson for those behind.</p><p>Being inside the Yin Coffin, it was possible to be shaken to death alive!</p><p>“Swish…”</p><p>There seemed to be a disturbance around.</p><p>At the same time, Yue Gongli’s teasing voice came from inside the coffin:</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, look around.”</p><p>Spiritual senses were almost nil, Perception visibility was very low.</p><p>In this pitch-black world, all means of observation were severely suppressed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could see his surroundings mainly because of his own eyes—those that were strengthened by the Dragon Apricot and, in this weird world, felt like the extraordinary vision was about to burst!</p><p>But his vision was much worse than usual.</p><p>Upon hearing him, Xu Xiaoshou turned around…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The surging wave of branches behind him, as if enraged, crazily surged forth again.</p><p>“Boom, boom, boom…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought about running, but the booming sounds came from the left, right, and even in front of him.</p><p>Looking around, the tsunami was not just chasing from behind but was coming from all directions!</p><p>Like a lone boat in a storm.</p><p>The world turned into raging waves.</p><p>Trying to capsize everything towards the center?</p><p>“You mother… are you setting me up?”</p><p>At this instant, Xu Xiaoshou realized what Yue Gongli’s “She can think” meant.</p><p>A tree that couldn’t think would only chase in one direction until it couldn’t catch up with its prey and forced it out of this world.</p><p>But if she could think, she would know to herd her prey in a dark world, reaching out her arms from all around to surround and finally herd her prey into a pen for a big feast!</p><p>Looking up at the Yin Coffin, Xu Xiaoshou understood why this guy chose to “shut down.”</p><p>“If it’s not absolutely necessary, people don’t like lying down in a coffin,” he said, though Yue Gongli took pleasure in his misfortune.</p><p>Chi Chi Chi!</p><p>The branches’ tsunami from all directions was about to engulf him, aiming to impale a person… no, to shatter him.</p><p>What’s the meaning of “no way up to heaven, no door into the earth”?</p><p>“Open up for me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou kicked the coffin lid.</p><p>The Yin Coffin buzzed as the Yellow Talisman swallowed the immense force but remained immobile.</p><p>“Don’t forget, you just tossed me aside; a man’s knees have Spirit Crystals, I knelt because of you, forced to call out ‘Mom,'” Yue Gongli was petty.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked around nervously, growing more tense, “But you said this coffin is big enough for two people!”</p><p>“Yes, I did say that, but did I say I would let you in?” Yue Gongli chuckled and covered his mouth.</p><p>“You!” Xu Xiaoshou was taken aback and then burst into laughter.</p><p>Fine, fine, fine.</p><p>You want to play like this, huh?</p><p>Only I used to toy with others, but today you really got me going, even turning it into a word game, huh?</p><p>Swish, swish, swish!</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
