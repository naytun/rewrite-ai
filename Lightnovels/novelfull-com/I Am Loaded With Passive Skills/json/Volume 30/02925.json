Ai Cangsheng had no choice but to return, and then Lord Shou entered in his stead, which compelled the issue of the ‘Invitation to Saint’… Another large group of demi-saints surged in!”</p><p>“As soon as the ‘Invitation to Saint’ was issued, Zhou Tianshen, who ranks first on the Ancestral God Ranking, ‘just happened’ to make his way to the Dark Forest, pushing the focus onto the abnormal area of the Ran Ming ruins. Coincidentally, Lord Shou discovered there traces of the Divine Relics World Tree Di Ying Holy Plant… The top two on the Ancestral God Ranking, both entered the Dark Forest!”</p><p>“Yue Gongli wants to snatch Lord Shou’s God Fated Star, the people from the Holy Divine Palace will definitely enter the Dark Forest; Elder Sleeveless and others wanting to protect Lord Shou will certainly enter the Dark Forest; the saintly figures summoned by the ‘Invitation to Saint’ are for the sake of Lord Shou, and more so to enter the Dark Forest… Everyone has to enter the Dark Forest!”</p><p>Does everyone have to die?</p><p>Perspiration beaded on Li Fugui’s forehead, his mind suddenly sprouting an ugly Dao Infant, as all the strange explanations described by Lord Shou found their source:</p><p>“The Di Ying Holy Plant!”</p><p>What does it want to do?</p><p>Is it playing for such high stakes?</p><p>From the very beginning of the Four Symbols Secret Realm Ran Ming Ruins’ emergence, a “thunderbolt” that would not die and would not experience Saint Fall was planted; after deceiving everyone inside, were they all cut off from retreat and left to die?</p><p>Then why could Hallmaster Dao remain unscathed, as he is said to have sought refuge with the five great aristocratic families of the Holy Emperor? Could he be in collusion with the Di Ying Holy Plant?</p><p>Or, did he foresee this, but being unable to avoid it, he went with the flow and continued to plot?</p><p>Ai Cangsheng of the Ten High Nobles could not rebel…</p><p>Dao Qiongcang of the Ten High Nobles could not avoid it either…</p><p>“Report—”</p><p>All of a sudden, a subordinate exclaimed in alarm.</p><p>Li Fugui, who was in the midst of overwhelming thoughts, was startled, his body shuddering as he turned around and said irritably, “Speak!”</p><p>“A message from the Valley of Floral Fragrance secret department; the leader of the Heavenly Alliance, Ban Sheng appeared. A Heavenly Alliance Order has been issued forbidding demi-saints from entering the God-Slayer’s Ruins anymore, saying… something’s gone wrong with the ruins!”</p><p>Li Fugui’s heart sank.</p><p>The matter had yet to conclude, as one voice had just quieted, another rose:</p><p>“Report—”</p><p>“A message from the Flower Pavilion; the God-Slayer’s Ruins can only be entered but not exited, the retreat is cut off, and it is suspected that the ‘immortality’ rule has been lifted. Now, everyone who dies inside… will actually die!?”</p><p>Li Fugui felt his heart sink again.</p><p>This time, not only did his complexion change.</p><p>The messenger himself was also full of shock, and everyone who heard it buzzed in uproar.</p><p>None of them were fools; every person present could sense the scent of a massive, shocking conspiracy.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>“Elder Mo, you must have seen wrong, or could there be an error with the transmission from the Flower Pavilion?”</p><p>“This is a Jade Scroll Message, are you doubting my spiritual senses, my expertise, or my loyalty?”</p><p>“No, Elder Mo, I only meant…”</p><p>“Silence!” Li Fugui bellowed, and the entire Mu Zixi information department instantly fell silent.</p><p>“Lord Li…”</p><p>The last one to return was as white as a sheet, touching his own throat and saying with trepidation, “If the transmission from the Flower Pavilion is true, then our people inside…”</p><p>At this, everyone’s spine chilled.</p><p>Indeed, for convenience, the quickest way for those working on intelligence in the Ran Ming Ruins was to cut their own throats.</p><p>To take one’s life every hundred breaths was quicker than a ready meal.</p><p>But this was the simplest method, not the most delightful.</p><p>Because they would not die, and the intelligence transmission work was quite boring, the brothers came up with a new way to play:</p><p>If the outcome was the same and the chance of not dying was once-in-a-lifetime, then the process could certainly be more creative, right?</p><p>Thus, there were all kinds: those who chose to disembowel, those who chose to be crucified, those who allowed a good brother to behead them to experience the feeling of being decapitated…</p><p>All were available!</p><p>Now, since the abnormal change in the Ran Ming Ruins, a quarter of an hour has passed.</p><p>Those who entered stopped due to the accident, while those inside could not get information from outside. If they were still trying the exit methods they had experimented with…</p><p>“No, it can’t be, right?”</p><p>A trembling voice stammered out.</p><p>He had been inside the ruins once, and his chosen method of death was beheading by his best friend with a large machete while five others pinned his limbs down, and he pretended to “struggle desperately.”</p><p>If…</p><p>If so!</p><p>How guilty must the one with the knife feel?</p><p>Can those who held the limbs still laugh?</p><p>“We must go in!” someone cried out in terror.</p><p>Yes, they must go in, let the brothers know they can’t play anymore, it’s not the time to play, or it will be the end of them!</p><p>But now…</p><p>Entering now means you can’t get out anymore!</p><p>Panic, unrest, anxiety, and other emotions spread like a web through every corner of the Mu Zixi information department.</p><p>All had their faces cast with a deep shadow, as if they had personally felt that sense of “guilt.”</p><p>No one came out anymore.</p><p>They all died from suicide or homicide inside the ruins.</p><p>Now, that place was a million times more terrifying than here—not just physically!</p><p>Li Fugui’s eyes swept around, his thoughts racing, as he said without emotion, “Who’s next in line to enter the ruins?”</p><p>“I am!” With no hesitation, a young man, about sixteen, stepped forward.</p><p>“Xiao Ran?”</p><p>The surrounding middle-aged and older figures immediately became anxious.</p><p>Intelligence work isn’t better the younger you are; it’s more valued the older you are.</p><p>But for a boy of such a young age to be chosen to join the Mu Zixi information department meant without a question that Xiao Ran’s talents and abilities were exceptional.</p><p>And such a well-tempered child…</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
