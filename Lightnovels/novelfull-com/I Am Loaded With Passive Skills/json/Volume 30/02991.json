Under his feet, a dazzling and glaring Power Upanishad Formation unfolded.</p><p>It seemed to enhance the power of his physique?</p><p>As he stepped forward, the formation dipped down and submerged into the earth.</p><p>With a booming sound, thousands of miles of rocks and stones shattered into the sky, suspended between heaven and earth, frozen mid-air.</p><p>A sandstorm also began to morph behind him, resembling a Raging Giant squinting its eyes, transforming into a ferociously evil specter that leaned forward, terrifying and soul-shaking, storm-splitting:</p><p>“War Saint Taizai Ci, come out and meet your death!!!”</p><p>…</p><p>Boom, boom, boom!</p><p>Wave after wave of Gang Force swept over the peak of the heavenly chasm, and the hollowed-out valley responded by shattering, with rocks tumbling down.</p><p>“War Saint Taizai Ci, come out and meet your death…”</p><p>“Come out and meet your death…”</p><p>“Death…”</p><p>That resonating roar, akin to God’s Punishment, appeared directly in people’s minds, accompanied by heavy, reverberating, forceful strikes.</p><p>“Ah ah ah—”</p><p>Around the Fate Temple’s signboard in the higher void, agonized screams rang out, people fell to the ground, bleeding from every orifice, foaming at the mouth, in excruciating pain.</p><p>Above in the sky, the figures of the Twelve Holy Lords collapsed and retreated, howled into disarray like dust and stones, their clothes torn and artifacts destroyed, in utter disarray.</p><p>“Heh.”</p><p>War Saint Taizai Ci sat unshaken atop a giant rock.</p><p>Beneath him, within the immense black shadow, a voice of shock and uncertainty emerged:</p><p>“Penetrating Divine Senses?”</p><p>The strength of the Twelve Holy Lords was well-known in the Northern Region.</p><p>For Xu Xiaoshou to roar, forcing them back like sand and stones, was simply inconceivable!</p><p>From this shout alone, shades of Penetrating Divine Senses could be glimpsed.</p><p>Ever since the War of the Ten High Nobles, every demi-saint in the world had been studying this method. Although few truly grasped it, they all recognized its power.</p><p>But…</p><p>What kind of Penetrating Divine Senses could be so potent to be embedded in pure sound waves, shattering Holy Lords and turning the world upside down without relying on any other methods?</p><p>“Even the Shadow Saint has been startled awake?”</p><p>Snake Lady chuckled while nestled in Taizai Ci’s arms.</p><p>Seeing the God of War Armor shine just once, with Taizai Ci not moving an inch, she knew that these Penetrating Divine Senses were nothing to worry about, incapable of breaking her man’s defense.</p><p>And the level of the Twelve Holy Lords was still a rank below hers.</p><p>“What a rough lad, only knows how to charge in, not understanding the importance of foreplay; well, let someone go meet him first.”</p><p>As she spoke, Snake Lady transformed into a stream of black smoke and disappeared.</p><p>“Snake Lady, wait!”</p><p>A giant shadow on the ground squirmed issuing a cry of horror, but it was too late.</p><p>…</p><p>“Elder Sang, Water Ghost, follow up, leave the small fries to you!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou released a roar that shattered the Twelve Holy Lords; his energy surged to its peak at that moment.</p><p>He didn’t worry about the humiliated and furious bugs that were about to return, knowing that the Four Saints behind him could block any obstacles for him, as he pointed towards the bottom of the heavenly chasm.</p><p>He had sensed an extremely strong stealth array near this location.</p><p>It wasn’t a Way of the Heavens’ energy movement array but a Saint Stage spiritual array, of a very high rank.</p><p>It used the power of Transformation to alter everything visible to the eye, and hid the location of the God-Slaying Token within a hazy, moonlit world.</p><p>Nothing was clear!</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou could intuitively sense that a demi-saint presence was lurking below, a strength he had rarely encountered in his life!</p><p>Just perfect…</p><p>To be my sword whetstone before I face Ai Gou!</p><p>“Swish.”</p><p>Just as he approached the chasm, a stream of black smoke rose from below, taking the form of a lady dressed in a thin red gauze, exuding an air of elegance.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paused for a moment, then reached out, grabbing towards the woman’s jade neck, showing no mercy:</p><p>“Are you calling yourself Taizai Ci?”</p><p>Snake Lady was startled by his words but then smiled, blooming like a flower, “I am not…”</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>Before she could finish speaking, Xu Xiaoshou had no intention of being polite. His charred scaly claw locked around the woman’s throat and he twisted fiercely.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Gurgle…</p><p>A strange sound emerged.</p><p>The Snake Lady’s head jerked to the side, leaving behind a sticky, moist liquid, as her head contorted out of the lock like a snake.</p><p>“You lad, why so impatient?”</p><p>Her face was filled with shock, and as she chided with lovely eyes, she breathed out a puff of dark purple fragrance.</p><p>“Whoosh~~~”</p><p>What is this stuff?</p><p>Isn’t Taizai Ci supposed to be a man? How could he employ such disgusting tactics?</p><p>“Corroded, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Poisoned, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Weakened, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Enfeebled, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Confused, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The Information Bar clattered rapidly.</p><p>A breath of Yoo Lan, eroding thousands of defenses.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt as if ten heavy negative statuses had instantly layered upon him, even triggering his Spirit Awakening.</p><p>His palm skin peeled due to corrosion, healing at an extremely slow pace.</p><p>That unknown rank of strange poison fed on his spiritual source, spreading throughout his limbs, relentlessly invading.</p><p>His body became weak…</p><p>His mind became muddled…</p><p>Even his vision briefly blurred, and his footing staggered.</p><p>“What kind of poison could be this effective?” Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. His current passive skills were certainly not superficial.</p><p>“Little brother…”</p><p>Snake Lady, with her tender green fingertips resting on her chin, teasingly said:</p><p>“This is ‘Locust Poison,’ drawn from the Ancestor Tree World Locust and refined with the blood of various ancient saint beasts. Caught off guard, even a Holy Emperor would succumb; how could you possibly withstand it?”</p><p>“Locust Poison flowing in the blood, as natural as heaven made, let big sister tell you the truth. Right now, you’re just dizzy and weak in your limbs. In ten Aura, your flesh will decay, the poison will corrode your spirit, and a hundred Aura later, you will… Hmm~”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
