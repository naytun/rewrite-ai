Anyway, Lord Shou, be careful.”</p><p>So, it’s like a set?</p><p>The second true body paused, then inquired, “Aside from wealth, is there anything else?”</p><p>“Strength!” Li Fugui quickly replied:</p><p>“Lord Shou, don’t think less of his strength just because wealth was mentioned first.”</p><p>“While his level of Spiritual Cultivation is indeed only that of a demi-saint…”</p><p>What am I saying… Li Fugui felt numb for a moment and then continued, “But that’s just on the surface. His true strength is rarely shown, yet being recognized by a demi-saint family, having the power to dominate the prodigies of the entire Yue Clan, he definitely has extraordinary aspects.”</p><p>“Such as?” the second true body didn’t want to hear any nonsense.</p><p>“Such as…” Li Fugui struggled to recall more information. If he had any, he would have already mentioned it. He could only speculate:</p><p>“He has researched the power of the evil god with Ai Cangsheng!”</p><p>“He loves to wander around. He’s been to many places, the Southern Region, the Northern Region, even Abyss Island…”</p><p>“The things he masters are very diverse…”</p><p>The second true body rarely saw Li Fugui so vague in his expression, but he could barely understand his meaning.</p><p>He knows everything?</p><p>He might also be capable of the power of the evil god, like me, compatible with the power of the two great ancestral sources?</p><p>“His insights into Spiritual Cultivation shouldn’t be underestimated either…”</p><p>“Upanishad?”</p><p>“I don’t know, I’ve never seen him with a Power Upanishad Formation, but this man, like Lord Shou, is very good at hiding; I think…”</p><p>“You don’t need to think anymore. Does he have any other notable traits?”</p><p>“Uh, uh… right, you can’t trust a word he says. Being approved by the demi-saint family…”</p><p>“Absolute loyalty?”</p><p>“Exactly!”</p><p>“Anything else?”</p><p>“Uh, let Fugui think…”</p><p>“Time is up, does he have any weaknesses?”</p><p>“Uh, weaknesses, weaknesses… he’s pretty chatty, and he’s quite frivolous!”</p><p>“Also?”</p><p>“Right, it means he loves to have fun and often gets into trouble because of it… uh, Fugui didn’t mean that. There’s no ‘also’…”</p><p>“Enough, what are some real weaknesses?”</p><p>“Oh, right, he’s afraid of the Needle Whip; he’s afraid of pain. That’s what Lord Bazhun’an has said!”</p><p>“What kind of nonsense is that? Has Eighth dealt with him before?” The second true body was momentarily confused; he wasn’t referring to that kind of weakness. “Anything else?”</p><p>As if having found a lead, Li Fugui excitedly raised his hand and declared loudly:</p><p>“He’s afraid of big sister!”</p><p>…</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Inside the Dragon Melting Realm within the Divine Ruins.</p><p>As everyone uncontrollably took off into the air, Xu Xiaoshou stepped through the void, and Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand reached for, not the still unidentified Nian, but the mastermind behind the scenes, Yue Gongli.</p><p>Capture the leader first.</p><p>Li Fugui, who at the end was completely talking nonsense, managed to provide a seemingly unreliable but marginally useful piece of intelligence about Yue Gongli’s “weakness”…</p><p>Afraid of pain!</p><p>It’s good enough if he’s not invulnerable.</p><p>Afraid of pain… Regardless of what kind of pain it’s about, strike first and find out later!</p><p>“Don’t mess around!”</p><p>Yue Gongli, clutching his Red Coat, barely managed to dodge to the side as the spatial ripples occurred, narrowly shifting his head away from the grasp of Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand.</p><p>Feeling the scorching burn, his face paled, and he cried out with wide eyes:</p><p>“I rely on my face to make a living!”</p><p>“You know you shouldn’t hit someone in the face, right?”</p><p>“I am the Red Coat Ruler of Dao, a descendant of the Holy Emperor of the Yue Clan. Give me some face…”</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand shifted from grabbing to slicing, passing by the neck of Yue Gongli, about to cut off his babbling.</p><p>“Yin Aura Door!”</p><p>With his teeth bared, Yue Gongli half-heartedly formed a seal amid panic, managing to invoke a door of chilling coldness to shield himself.</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
