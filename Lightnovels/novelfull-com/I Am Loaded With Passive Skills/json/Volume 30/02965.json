I heard that the Six Paths is not the strongest, and that ancient martial arts does not stop at Six Paths—it’s just that The Divine has only shown six…”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Because that was enough.”</p><p>The people around chattered on, but not one could provide any information about Four Sacrifice.</p><p>The Path of the Ancient Swordsman still has a lineage in the Shengshen Continent today.</p><p>However, ancient martial arts were almost a single lineage, I’ve heard it’s even required for The Divine to deduce the far reaches of the Great Path on his own.</p><p>Even the Physique Division of the Holy Divine Palace couldn’t figure it out. Naturally, these Spiritual Cultivators, who focused all their energy on the Way of Spiritual Cultivation, knew even less.</p><p>Elder Sang did know a bit and, in a low voice like reciting an incantation, he blurted:</p><p>“Nine Palaces, Eight Doors, Seven Constellations, Six Paths, Four Sacrifice, three realms, Two Forms, One Venerate.”</p><p>“This is ancient martial arts!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was taken aback, having heard and even witnessed something about the nines, eights, sevens, and sixes.</p><p>But he had thought that the Six Paths, if not the pinnacle, were already a very high realm. After all, The Divine at Six Paths could single-handedly challenge the Di Ying Holy Plant.</p><p>Who would have thought that there was such a long string of others after that?</p><p>Nine, eight, seven, six; that was only half the journey of ancient martial arts, with another half to go?</p><p>“Are you joking?” Xu Xiaoshou responded in a low voice, a trace of astonishment in his tone:</p><p>“Six Paths can battle a Low Realm Holy Emperor, but what about Four Sacrifice and three realms? Aren’t they godhood-sealing and ancestor-revering?”</p><p>“And the remaining Two Forms and One Venerate, do they intend to hang the Ancestral Gods and beat them up?”</p><p>“Also, following this order… What about the number five? Did you eat it?”</p><p>Elder Sang shook his head silently, indicating that he knew no more, and turned his gaze to The Divine ahead.</p><p>“You don’t know ancient martial arts?” The Divine finally spoke.</p><p>After going around in circles, he had thought Xu Xiaoshou was a natural candidate for ancient martial arts, with a lot of prior training foundation.</p><p>Otherwise, this kid’s physique wouldn’t be this strong.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he was ignorant to this extent, not even knowing the basic incantations of ancient martial arts.</p><p>This was like a Sword Deity not knowing what the Nine Major Sword Techniques, the Eighteen Sword Forms, and the 3000 Sword Styles were, or the difference between them?</p><p>Without waiting for Xu Xiaoshou to ask further, The Divine continued as he walked forwards:</p><p>“Sleeveless spoke incorrectly.”</p><p>“A miss is as good as a mile.”</p><p>“Nine Palaces, Eight Doors, Seven Constellations, Six Paths, Four Sacrifice, three realms, Two Forms, One Venerate, missing five—Wuji—this is ancient martial arts!”</p><p>Missing Five…</p><p>Wuji…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was impressed, though he did not thoroughly understand.</p><p>Are there two more?</p><p>Give others a chance to live!</p><p>“‘Missing Five’ is a boxing skill, originally called ‘Five Deficiencies Fist.’ It’s the only ancient boxing skill in this school that can be learned only after achieving great success in ancient martial arts. You should have some impression of it.”</p><p>After waiting a while and seeing that Xu Xiaoshou was still puzzled, The Divine shook his head slightly and said:</p><p>“God level Shattering Fist.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou then remembered.</p><p>Back in Jade Capital City, during the time in Jade Capital City, when The Divine’s virtual image emerged and opened the Six Paths and nearly punched through Inverted Mountain.</p><p>During that time, the only boxing skill that had a name and was used was called “God level Shattering Fist.”</p><p>“I remember now,” Xu Xiaoshou pondered.</p><p>“That was a simplified version of Missing Five, considered the very first… ” The Divine nodded, “The Zeroth Fist, let’s say.”</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>What did you say?</p><p>Let me process this…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts came to a halt.</p><p>The Zeroth Fist, not even considered an entry-level technique? The Divine, with your rugged looks, have you learned to joke as well?</p><p>Clearly, The Divine wasn’t one to joke. After calmly explaining about Missing Five, he then turned to mention Wuji:</p><p>“Wuji, you don’t need to think about it for now; it’s a bit too far off.”</p><p>“Even I haven’t comprehended it yet. Perhaps Wuji doesn’t even exist.”</p><p>Oh, my Divine, I don’t care about Wuji right now; I just want to know how strong you really are… Xu Xiaoshou hesitated before asking:</p><p>“So, you mean to say, aside from Wuji, you’ve grasped everything else?”</p><p>The Divine was silent.</p><p>After a long while, he glanced sideways, scanning the startled onlookers around him. His calm face took on an air of disdain as if to say:</p><p>Are you brainless?</p><p>With so many people watching, is it a good idea to ask such a direct question?</p><p>Soon, low murmurs of discussion began to boil over, hard to suppress:</p><p>“No way, I knew The Divine was strong, but this strong?”</p><p>“Do the Ten High Nobles have no limit? The saying ‘Godhood called a god at the gates of hell’ was already outrageous enough, and now you’re telling me they haven’t even seen half of The Divine’s strength?”</p><p>“With such a being as a Saint Servant, why bother concealing it? Just go straight to the sacred mountain, to the realm of the Five Great Holy Emperors…”</p><p>“Cough cough! Old Zhao, be careful with your words!”</p><p>Suddenly, everyone fell silent.</p><p>All eyes turned to Yue Gongli, who had retreated to a location quite far away.</p><p>Yue Gongli held his hands awkwardly at his sides, with a slightly hunched back as if trying to reduce his presence.</p><p>No use!</p><p>After being the focus of everyone’s attention, he awkwardly stretched his smile, chucked twice as if to say:</p><p>I’m just weak sauce, don’t mind me, carry on.</p><p>Not likely!</p><p>The Divine followed the crowd’s gaze, turning towards that handsome young face.</p><p>The young pretty boy quickly plastered on a smile and began to wave, as if to say:</p><p>“Long time no see, we’ve met several times before.”</p><p>The Divine watched.</p><p>Huang Quan subtly retreated half a step backward, stepping on the ground without making a sound.</p><p>Yue Gongli immediately jumped and cursed, “What are you doing! We’re allies! Allies!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
