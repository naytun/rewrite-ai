It was unknown whence it had been acquired… No longer important.</p><p>“Moment of Enlightenment!”</p><p>The Ultimate Giant’s body shook, then its reaction speed, body speed accelerated as if by a factor of ten thousand.</p><p>It wickedly scooped and, due to the swift motion, went past the Thunder Sword, then hurriedly pulled back to scoop once more before it managed to grasp the now immensely slower Thunder Sword.</p><p>That massive Thunder Light Sword was pinched in the palm and flung towards the distance!</p><p>“Boom—”</p><p>Not even the saint calamity was as terrifying as this Thunder Sword now covered with sword cognition and the Raging Giant’s strength!</p><p>Fu Jiu, targeted, felt numb and without looking back threw an array of talismans frantically behind:</p><p>“Tribulation-breaking Talisman!”</p><p>“Destruction Spirit Talisman!”</p><p>“Godhood-Sealing Talisman!”</p><p>“To destroy…”</p><p>Snap.</p><p>The Phantom Swords Technique dissolved.</p><p>The giant kicked and shattered Fu Jiu.</p><p>On the other side, Ye Xiao, who was still pleased with not being targeted first, holding a Flying Flower and yet to make a move, was crushed into dust by the Thunder Light Sword.</p><p>—The Ultimate Giant capable of wielding Ancient Sword Technique!</p><p>…</p><p>In an instant, the Central Hexagram Saint was reduced to a single Saint.</p><p>Verbal Spiritual Spell stopped abruptly, his body plummeting like falling into a cold cellar, icy cold all over.</p><p>He compressed the endless power into his throat, turned around, and looked back at the Ultimate Giant, who had also ceased all movement.</p><p>He mustered all his strength, drew all his courage, and pointed fiercely ahead, then took a deep breath before blurting out:</p><p>“Giant, back off!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Ultimate Giant, indeed reprimanded by his words, took a small step back.</p><p>Verbal Spiritual Spell was immediately overjoyed, no longer caring about his hair going half-white or his body aging. He pointed, stomped, and shouted again:</p><p>“Giant, retreat! Retreat! Retreat!”</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The Ultimate Giant, taking three more steps back.</p><p>Verbal Spiritual Spell was ecstatic and about to gather energy for another command when…</p><p>“Phew!”</p><p>Before his words could escape, he violently coughed up reverse blood, staggering and falling to the ground.</p><p>Earlier, he was at least strong and towering, and even if less so, he had a tall and well-proportioned figure, with a hint of cold elegance in his silence, truly possessing the demeanor of a demi-saint.</p><p>But now, he was as thin as kindling, seemingly at the end of his years, with several teeth that had aged away, struggling to speak and only able to shed tears.</p><p>“Uh!”</p><p>“Uhm, uh!”</p><p>He struggled desperately to speak but couldn’t say a word.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>The Ultimate Giant disappeared, Xu Xiaoshou returned aboard his sword, landing before this forlorn elder.</p><p>Was this the end?</p><p>Dazed for a full three breaths, Xu Xiaoshou thought of Yue Gongli, thought of Di Ying Holy Plant, thought of The Divine, and finally remembered himself.</p><p>Blood energy surged within him…</p><p>After 90% of the Body Dao Disc, even without the Body of Devour and the Human Realm Dao, his Eternal Vitality felt as though it was Strengthened by countless folds; with the Ultimate Giant activated for so long, he still had three or four tenths of his power left.</p><p>After a while regaining his senses, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but let out a laugh.</p><p>He had fought too many experts, faced the Holy Emperor and the Ten High Nobles, but had somewhat forgotten what the normal strength of a demi-saint should be.</p><p>“Sorry, I overestimated you guys.”</p><p>His eyes brightened, and Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze shot forth a yoo light:</p><p>“Soul Reading!”</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Verbal Spiritual Spell’s body convulsed violently one last time and then lost all movement.</p><p>He was the first demi-saint to be consumed and killed by his own strength; the remaining five demi-saints still possessed indomitable souls and wills.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grasped behind him and just happened to touch the Flame Python.</p><p>Beneath his feet, the Way of the Sword Disc spun, and as he opened the Phantom Swords Technique, he saw the five imminent soul bodies of the demi-saints.</p><p>“I said, if you don’t retreat, you will die.”</p><p>In the Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation, the part that belonged to the Heart Sword Technique suddenly shone brightly. Xu Xiaoshou abandoned any caution against remnants, wills, or unforeseen moves.</p><p>“Heart Sword Technique, Wisdom is Emptiness!”</p><p>The Flame Python slashed through the void.</p><p>Silence returned to the surroundings.</p><p>One thought divine, another thought devoid of wisdom.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
