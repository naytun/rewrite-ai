If you want it, just say so. What’s with all this fuss?”</p><p>Elder Sang was left speechless.</p><p>That wasn’t what he meant at all.</p><p>“However…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paused, an insinuating lift of his eyebrows as he said, “Bazhun’an once told me not to use the semi-saint person for sanctification, not even for a sword saint.”</p><p>Of course, Elder Sang knew what he was talking about, his gaze flicking briefly towards Water Ghost, “But not even he can do it.”</p><p>“So, none of you can, only I can?” Xu Xiaoshou was once again amused, his brows dancing with mirth.</p><p>To this point, Elder Sang surprisingly did not contradict him but pondered deeply, “Maybe, the Ten High Nobles can.”</p><p>Bai Zhou was confused.</p><p>Wait, are you two engaging in some coded language again?</p><p>Why is it that every single word, every syllable, I recognize when they’re separate, but as soon as they’re put together, they stop making sense?</p><p>“You wouldn’t understand even if I told you,” Elder Sang looked back.</p><p>“And you wouldn’t fully grasp it even if I explained,” Xu Xiaoshou also chimed in with the banter.</p><p>Elder Sang glared at him viciously once more—he found that now, the most effective attack he had against Xu Xiaoshou was just that.</p><p>“Don’t change the subject!”</p><p>“You even managed to kill the Hexagram Saint, so now you’ve truly grown hard wings. Tell me, what are your plans next?”</p><p>He seemed completely ready to let go.</p><p>Unconcerned that if this rebellious disciple really did take action, his title as the second-in-command saint servant would truly become “former” and never recover.</p><p>The crowd around them, aside from Bai Zhou and the absent-minded Cen Qiaofu, clearly detected an air of resignation in Sleeveless’s remark.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, on the other hand, noticed nothing and instinctively wanted to remain passive, letting Elder Sang and Water Ghost charge ahead.</p><p>After all, I’m only responsible for the combat strength, the same position as Cen Qiaofu will do.</p><p>But on second thought…</p><p>There were some things that Elder Sang and Water Ghost really couldn’t do now.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou swiped through the void, and a spatial mirror appeared, saying:</p><p>“After I finished off the Hexagram Saint, I immediately searched for The Divine’s location but couldn’t find him no matter what.”</p><p>Not even Spatial Upanishad could locate The Divine; did that mean he wasn’t in this realm?</p><p>Everyone seemed struck with thought, their eyes quickly filling with surprise.</p><p>The Thirty Third Heavens?</p><p>“Continue,” Elder Sang said with furrowed brows, withholding his opinion.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou went on:</p><p>“Not ruling out the possibility of The Divine entering a special secret realm.”</p><p>“But I think it’s highly likely he wouldn’t go looking, nor be passively trapped without a way out.”</p><p>“His nature, now that he’s targeted the Di Ying Holy Plant, would be just to keep fighting mindlessly onward.”</p><p>“That is to say, it’s highly probable that he’s actually climbed up to the Thirty Three Heavens because in this realm, I found no place resembling the Dark Forest.”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Water Ghost nodded in thought and added, “Feather Ascension Three Realms, revealing the true name… at this time, he should meet Ran Ming, get the legacy, and the Divine Relics should close.”</p><p>“Yes,” Xu Xiaoshou spread his hands, “And yet, it hasn’t.”</p><p>Elder Sang met the gaze of this defiant disciple and moved his lips: “Continue.”</p><p>Are you slacking off too?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t throw the question back, because he knew a tiny bit more than Elder Sang and Water Ghost.</p><p>“When I was with Yue Gongli at the Dark Divine Court, he let slip…”</p><p>“The Ancestral God Fate Chart is, with high probability, gone.”</p><p>“Even for the Ran Ming legacy, judging from his tone and behavior, he wasn’t optimistic.”</p><p>“Yue Gongli cannot be trusted, even if what you see feels real,” Water Ghost cautioned.</p><p>“I know, but this is a kind of…” Xu Xiaoshou squinted, taking a long time to weigh his words.</p><p>Everyone listened intently, looking forward to a brilliant interpretation from Lord Shou, and then he said:</p><p>“Intuition.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lifted his head, his eyes brimming with confidence: “It’s a man’s sixth sense!”</p><p>“Criticized, Passive Points +16.”</p><p>Elder Sang thought of the Great Path Diagram of Will and surprisingly showed approval, “Continue.”</p><p>Even demi-saints can have whims!</p><p>At this time, everyone began to associate Lord Shou’s comical performance with some sort of sixth sense, suggesting a term that would more fittingly describe an actual ability.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t linger on these topics, and instead asked,</p><p>“I want to know, how did Wangze Holy Emperor manage to kill our people during the days I was cultivating?”</p><p>“In the First Heavens, including this realm, I couldn’t find any trace of him.”</p><p>This was by no means an overstatement.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou truly couldn’t believe that Wangze Holy Emperor could hide his whereabouts under his abilities, even if he was revered as the Holy Emperor.</p><p>And now, I…</p><p>Though I carry no title of Holy Emperor, what difference is there between me and a Holy Emperor?</p><p>At these words, the faces of everyone around darkened, and Bai Zhou angrily said,</p><p>“Why would the Holy Emperor need a method to kill?”</p><p>“Of course he wouldn’t need to come in-person; with just a flick of his intent, commanding the rules, he could make your… our people die abruptly, one each day.”</p><p>Die abruptly?</p><p>So, when Wangze Holy Emperor is killing our people, you all can’t even find where the person is, or how he strikes?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fell silent.</p><p>He didn’t say any more but directly presented his conclusion:</p><p>“If you ask me, Di Ying Holy Plant, Ran Ming’s true name, The Divine, Wangze Holy Emperor—all the factors that can truly sway the grand scheme—are now in the Thirty Three Heavens.”</p><p>This statement was so definitive that it subconsciously compelled others to question it, Water Ghost being no exception.</p><p>After a moment of thought, he stopped and just looked towards Sleeveless.</p><p>Expecting Sleeveless would at least utter “How can you tell?” Who would have thought he simply nodded significantly:</p><p>“You’re right.”</p><p>“Acknowledged, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, as if encouraged, went on,</p><p>“That Wangze, coveting me, has ignored my repeated mentions of the Holy Emperor’s name. He’s in a bit of danger now.”</p><p>“At least I am the World Tree, I want Ran Ming’s inheritance, I want to reach the Ancestral God, then like the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit, I will try my utmost to prevent the Holy Emperor’s rule over my realm of the Land Realm.”</p><p>“That is to say, he might be able to come in, but that does not necessarily mean he is at his peak!”</p><p>As he spoke, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes shone fiercely, and he licked his lips with his tongue.</p><p>Everyone was startled.</p><p>Looking at this posture, was it not enough to kill a demi-saint? Was Lord Shou now setting his sights even higher, on the Holy Emperor?</p><p>“So what about us…”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu was also shocked back to reality, thinking that Xu Xiaoshou was now going to lead everyone to ascend to the Thirty Three Heavens and execute the Wangze Holy Emperor on the spot.</p><p>“We…”</p><p>“Of course, we don’t need to bother with them!”</p><p>With another swipe of his hand, Xu Xiaoshou changed the image on the spatial mirror, revealing an ancient plaque:</p><p>“They’ll do their thing, and we’ll do ours to them… Do you see this thing?”</p><p>All looked up to see four big characters on the plaque: Fate Temple!</p><p>“What is that?” someone from the back hesitantly asked.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled, “The God-Slaying Token, I’ve tampered with it.”</p><p>“God Slaying Temple?” Elder Sang finally showed a look of shock.</p><p>Water Ghost, too, seemed to have a realization but was quick to remind, “Yue Gongli… he got ahead of us by more than just one step. I fear he’s plotted something!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head with indifference and with another swipe, the spatial mirror Dissolved into over twenty pieces.</p><p>On each piece, the blurry figure of a person appeared.</p><p>No one could see clearly.</p><p>At this moment, everyone knew that each person being specifically located was a demi-saint!</p><p>“Lord Shou…”</p><p>In an instant, all the saint servants were chilled to the bone.</p><p>Even including Bai Zhou, the look in their eyes towards Xu Xiaoshou became tinged with fear.</p><p>Demi-saints are sensitive and very perceptive!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had located them using the spatial mirror, yet these people didn’t even feel it. His ability…</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Spatial Upanishad, then no problem.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew what Water Ghost was worried about, but he also knew everyone was not yet out of the passive mindset of being on the receiving end.</p><p>He said nothing but slowly bent down and started to pick up the semi-saint positions strewn across the ground.</p><p>For each one he picked up, the expressions of those around shifted slightly.</p><p>From panic to tension, to anticipation, to excitement, to thrill…</p><p>“Click.”</p><p>Cramming a full five semi-saint positions into Water Ghost’s arms, Xu Xiaoshou raised his head, looking steadfastly into his eyes and pronounced resoundingly,</p><p>“Fight scheme with scheme!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
