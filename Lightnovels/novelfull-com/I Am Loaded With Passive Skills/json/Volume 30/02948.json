He said softly,</p><p>“Retreat now, and nothing will happen.”</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>Changyi drew in a sharp breath, ready to flee at a moment’s notice as he took a half step back.</p><p>He knew this bald big man was strong, capable of defeating him in a single blow, nearly the pinnacle of human combat strength.</p><p>But the pinnacle also depends on which level it is!</p><p>Defeating a demi-saint is one thing.</p><p>In front of the Evil Tree, a single word could control him, hold sway over the surrounding extraordinary individuals, and even Yun himself had felt a momentary daze.</p><p>What is this?</p><p>This is the power of the Holy Emperor’s Guidance!</p><p>This means she must be at least a Low Realm Holy Emperor, and considering the level of her bizarre abilities, she is probably capable of devouring people without leaving any residue behind!</p><p>Does Yun also want to defeat the opponent in an instant?</p><p>“That’s pretty cocky!”</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou felt Yun was getting carried away.</p><p>He had seen The Divine’s virtual image take action and had even witnessed him head for the Sacred Mountain, almost destroying the great array of the Saint Mountain with one punch.</p><p>But the result was…</p><p>Stopped by Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>Although the Ten High Nobles were the Ten High Nobles, the composition within them was too complicated. Did you not see that Kong Yuhen was even bizarrely vulnerable to coffins…</p><p>Under the Dragon Apricot tree, while boiling wine and discussing heroes, Li Fugui had also mentioned that The Divine was not in perfect condition.</p><p>Firstly, he was trapped at Cross Corner Street within the City of the Dead Bodhisattva.</p><p>Secondly, as long as Aunt Xiang, The Divine’s limiter, was alive, he would always have vulnerabilities…</p><p>His thoughts halted there.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked absentmindedly at the staff in this man’s hand.</p><p>He had never seen this item before, but had learned of it through images and from Li Fugui:</p><p>“One of the nine supreme divine weapons, Overlord!”</p><p>Yes!</p><p>The Overlord has been brought out.</p><p>The Divine is no longer a virtual image but in his real form.</p><p>This place is no longer Cross Corner Street, where The Divine was limited by the Force of Rules. This is the Divine Relics, the embryonic form of the divine palace, strange as it may be, with no limitations imposed from above.</p><p>Aunt Xiang?</p><p>This limiter isn’t here right now!</p><p>Even if she were, does the Di Ying Holy Plant, even if capable of thought and understanding the pros and cons, know how to use Aunt Xiang to checkmate The Divine?</p><p>The one standing before us now, where is the imperfect version of one of the Ten High Nobles?</p><p>He is the young and arrogant Bazhun’an, Kui Leihan sitting cross-legged, Hallmaster Dao tearing off his shirt, the one outside the City of the Living Bodhisattva…</p><p>“The Divine, Heavenly Unravel?”</p><p>…</p><p>Hiss!!!</p><p>A piercing shriek broke his train of thought.</p><p>Having its guidance shattered and threatened by a mere human, the Di Ying Holy Plant tore off its disguise and revealed its extremely evil nature in an instant.</p><p>Even though reason told her that the seemingly insignificant human before her was not to be trifled with,</p><p>But is the Ancestor Tree easy to provoke?</p><p>Is the power of the Holy Emperor, bolstered by its native divine palace, easy to provoke?</p><p>Are the Void Giant Master, Cursed Yin Evil God, and Ultimate Giant easy to provoke? Haven’t they all been defeated by me!</p><p>“My child! My child!”</p><p>“My children…”</p><p>The earnest calls of the Di Ying Holy Plant went completely insane, “Come and meet your death!”</p><p>Chi Chi Chi Chi Chi!</p><p>The myriad tree branches, imbued with the powers of the Heavenly Ancestor and the evil god, emitting an eerie light, shot from the trunk of the Tree Mother!</p><p>The force behind it was immense.</p><p>Even those like Water Ghost and Bai Zhou, who recognized the name of The Divine, couldn’t help but brace for execution, charging up to flee.</p><p>“You’re not running?”</p><p>Changyi’s face turned green with fear.</p><p>If you don’t run, and I do, doesn’t that make me look like the weakest?</p><p>But without fleeing… are you all insane?</p><p>Just standing there, not defending or retreating, purely letting this bald man shoulder it on his own?</p><p>Can he hold out?</p><p>“Whoosh.”</p><p>Everyone’s bodies leaned back.</p><p>The Divine, on the other hand, flew forward with his staff in hand.</p><p>Covering the endless branches of the Ancestral Tree and carrying the dual powers of the ancestral source, he simply lit up various acupuncture points one after the other as he soared.</p><p>“Kai! Sheng! Shang! Du! Jing! Si! Jing! Kai!”</p><p>With held breath, Xu Xiaoshou recognized these as the Ancient Martial Eight Doors, which The Divine’s virtual image had opened before, but never as dazzlingly as The Divine’s real form was now.</p><p>After the Eight Doors, the Seven Constellations opened one after another:</p><p>“Tianshu! Tianxuan! Tianji! Tianquan! Yuheng! Sun Opening! Fluctuating Ray!”</p><p>In an instant, it was as bright as daylight.</p><p>But with a mere mortal body, he dared to ascend to the Ancestral Trees and confront the ancestral source’s power. Merely by opening these Eight Doors and Seven Constellations, not only did The Divine not fall short in terms of aura, he possibly even surpassed it!</p><p>“Sidestroke.”</p><p>The Overlord swung from the left waist, twirled to the top of the head, and then from palm to side, swept across the sky from right to left.</p><p>Unadorned and simple.</p><p>Without a hint of fancifulness.</p><p>“Smack!”</p><p>It hit about a dozen of the Ancestor Tree Branches, causing them to pause for a moment, stopping right in front of him.</p><p>But it only halted the offensive momentum of the branches imbued with the power of the ancestral source.</p><p>The Overlord’s staff had once broken demi-saints.</p><p>Now, however, it failed even to repel a dozen or so branches!</p><p>Seeing this, Changyi became thoroughly unsettled. Wanting to back away but unable to, he could only shout:</p><p>“Run, the power of the ancestral source, how can this be fought?”</p><p>“Even if our leader comes, he can’t fight it!”</p><p>Whoosh whoosh!</p><p>At that moment, a wind arose from within the world.</p><p>A colossal staff illusion drew an arc in the sky, passing through the forest of branches ahead from right to left.</p><p>The tips of the branches poised to strike The Divine were unaffected by its force, but the middle and end sections of the branches shattered instantly.</p><p>“Pop Pop Pop Pop Pop…”</p><p>The sound of shattering was incessant.</p><p>The world seemed to be showering with tree branches, countless of which fell to the ground.</p><p>And with their roots severed, the branch tips reinforced with the power of the ancestral source naturally became rootless duckweed, falling upon hearing the sound.</p><p>“How is this possible?” Changyi’s eyes bulged, exclaiming in shock. He seemed to have become the clown who was constantly startled and amazed.</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
