If we work together, we both win. If we fight, we both lose. I won’t say anything rash, just let go first!”</p><p>“You let go first!”</p><p>“Let’s let go together… I’ll count to three… let’s be gentlemen this time, and stop talking nonsense. We’re both recognizable figures.”</p><p>“For sure, you count. I can’t hold it back much longer.”</p><p>“One, two, three, let go!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Aaaaah, Xu Xiaoshou, you despicable little scoundrel, you really can’t be trusted!”</p><p>“Hahaha, Moon Fox, you shameless rogue, you still want to trick me?”</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>“Annihilation!”</p><p>They completely lost control!</p><p>The scene completely spiraled out of control!</p><p>The Six Marrow Corpse King got so scared that it bumped its head, trying to push the coffin lid open to escape.</p><p>But as soon as it stretched out a leg, the branches of Di Ying Holy Plant waiting on the outside began to wriggle, ready to pierce through it.</p><p>“Whoa!”</p><p>It got so frightened that it retreated back under the lid of the coffin, properly placing the lid back on, and then, looking at the two even crazier humans, it curled up, covered its head, and let out a heart-wrenching scream:</p><p>“Woo hoo hoo hoo!!”</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The mirrored surface shattered, Yin Moon splintered apart.</p><p>Yue Gongli’s hand seals stopped, pushing forward with a move.</p><p>Weng!</p><p>With a clap of his palms, the source seed merged.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, holding this rare power pill, tossed it forward, the Infernal set off the explosion.</p><p>“Drip-drop.”</p><p>Time dripped like water, then halted abruptly.</p><p>A slightly strange voice rose behind them:</p><p>“My friends, feeling anxious, are we?”</p><p>Who?!</p><p>Yue Gongli’s pupils trembled, a human voice?</p><p>A third person’s voice inside the Yin Coffin? Oh no, don’t scare me, I’m afraid of ghosts…</p><p>Anxious?</p><p>This voice, Brother Anxiety?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was also startled, then remembered, didn’t he just see “All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion”?</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>Yes, Kong Yuhen has arrived!</p><p>We’re saved! What am I struggling over here with this disemboweler guy, playing with self-destruction?</p><p>“Stop, stop!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou panicked; Engulfing Power flared up as he was the first to swallow the explosive source seed into his belly, “It’s Kong Yuhen, one of the Ten High Nobles! We’re saved, we’re saved!”</p><p>Kong Yuhen?</p><p>Yue Gongli glanced sideways and saw a handsome scholar in a pale green robe, looking scholarly and extremely frail.</p><p>He was momentarily confused before he remembered who Kong Yuhen was.</p><p>Kong Yuhen, the one who drinks wine amidst eternal regret, the most mysterious among the Ten High Nobles?</p><p>But if Xu Xiaoshou already withdrew his explosive source seed, and he had already made his move, it was like spilled water that can’t be gathered up again.</p><p>The Divine Relics were closing, and even demi-saints would die here. If Xu Xiaoshou perishes now, there would be no chance for him to come back.</p><p>Since that’s the case, might as well…</p><p>When the hand seals broke the power of time, Yue Gongli’s eyes flashed with ruthless determination. At the same time, he caught sight of Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth widening open, his throat gleaming ominously.</p><p>“Hehe,” he gave a forced laugh.</p><p>Irretrievable?</p><p>Non-existent.</p><p>“Reverse Technique · Vanishing Technique of Yin and Yang.”</p><p>He formed a strange seal with his fingers, and that chaotic and uncontrollable energy, like a docile kitten, was reabsorbed back into Yue Gongli’s energy reserve.</p><p>Little chap…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was hugely shocked.</p><p>Such terrifying energy, with the Three Great Ancestral Powers embedded to this extent, and yet you can reabsorb it?</p><p>You’re truly disgusting, hiding so long, hiding so much, never making a move, just waiting to backstab me?</p><p>Instead of letting you backstab me later, I’d rather send you to hell right now!</p><p>“Go.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s throat bulged as the explosive source seed that almost got swallowed shot out again.</p><p>Yue Gongli’s expression changed; his fingertip seals altered, Yin and Yang receded, and Yin Moon returned.</p><p>“Three Ancestor Seals · Cursed Yin Chi Yue, go!”</p><p>Kong Yuhen could not watch any longer. With a point of his finger in the air, ripples of the Great Path surged.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>“Withdraw!”</p><p>“Return!”</p><p>Three words were declared.</p><p>The explosive source seed and the Three Ancestor Seals, on the verge of a clash, were forcibly halted, repelled, and one returned to the mouth while the other returned to the hands.</p><p>“Hehe,” Yue Gongli rotated his hands, retracted the power, showing no embarrassment.</p><p>“Haha, you’re quite formidable,” Xu Xiaoshou swallowed hard, not sure whether he’d actually swallowed the object or not.</p><p>“Both of you.”</p><p>Kong Yuhen’s face showed helplessness, “Please, stop. It’s too…”</p><p>These were the most anxious competitors he’d ever seen in his life, practically on guard against each other up to their throats.</p><p>“I’ll give face to my brother Yu Hen.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took the initiative to swallow, Engulfing Power blazed forth, and the once uncontrollable explosive energies were easily retrieved.</p><p>Yue Gongli’s fox-like eyes suddenly gained a touch of astonishment.</p><p>Little chap!</p><p>Is this the topmost of the Five Extreme Physiques, the Body of Devour?</p><p>If this child isn’t removed, there will be endless trouble later on…</p><p>Yet Kong Yuhen showed only a few moves, his understanding of spacetime too profound.</p><p>They weren’t close to begin with, and if he persisted, he would only completely drive Kong Yuhen into Xu Xiaoshou’s camp.</p><p>If the two of them unite, not against the Di Ying Holy Plant but against him, he definitely won’t end up well.</p><p>“I’ve long heard of the great name of Kong Yuhen, one of the Ten High Nobles. Seeing you today indeed confirms you’re extraordinary.” Yue Gongli clapped his hands, also dispersing the energy, as if nothing had happened just before.</p><p>He wanted to exchange a couple more pleasantries…</p><p>“Boom boom boom!”</p><p>The Yin Coffin suddenly got blasted away.</p><p>The walls of the coffin, along with the Six Marrow Corpse King inside, crashed toward Xu Xiaoshou, passing by Kong Yuhen and heading his way.</p><p>Yue Gongli was just about to dodge when he saw Xu Xiaoshou’s “out-of-control” body falling towards him, his thigh transforming into a sharp blade coming down, “Ouch.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you shameless scum!”</p><p>Yue Gongli roared furiously, hurriedly dodging aside.</p><p>Boom boom boom boom boom…</p><p>The unexpected didn’t come out of nowhere.</p><p>The branches of the Di Ying Holy Plant, sensing the halt of energy between the two inside the coffin, realized something and launched a fierce attack.</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
