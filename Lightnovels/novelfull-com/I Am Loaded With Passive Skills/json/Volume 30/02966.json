We went shrimp fishing together at the Cold Palace Emperor Realm Cold Water Pond… My big sister was there too! Three of us!”</p><p>Murmurs rose around them once again.</p><p>Amidst them, some fearless voices could be faintly heard:</p><p>“Isn’t he the new head of the red-clothed people and also seems to be a successor of the Holy Emperor? He’s too meek, isn’t he?”</p><p>“Dao Xuanji is a hundred times stronger than him!”</p><p>“Is this the oppressive aura of the Ten High Nobles? The Divine… But does Yue Gongli really know Xiang Yaoyao?”</p><p>“His big sister is Yue Gongnu, the one at the top of the Continent’s List of Peerless Beauties, right?”</p><p>“I always said Aunt Xiang was not simple…”</p><p>The discussions were varied and continuous.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held his forehead, buzzing somewhat dizzily.</p><p>He dared to say that at least ninety percent of Yue Gongli’s cowardice was an act.</p><p>But the one undeniable fact was that he truly did not wish to start a fight with The Divine here.</p><p>Who would want to, really?</p><p>It would be the same anywhere in the Shengshen Continent!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was tempted to provoke The Divine just once, to get him to stop pursuing the Di Ying Holy Plant and to completely finish off Yue Gongli here, which seemed more paramount.</p><p>But after seeing Yue Gongli’s poor attempt at ingratiating himself, and as The Divine turned his gaze away without any ripples of intent to fight, Xu Xiaoshou felt it inappropriate to speak further.</p><p>Joking aside, who could command The Divine? Didn’t you see Elder Sang and Water Ghost and the like not even venturing a peep?</p><p>He still wanted to learn about the Four Scarifice!</p><p>But words stuck in his throat were indeed suffocating him, and he even began to somewhat loathe Aunt Xiang.</p><p>Ah! My precious Divine, I would forsake all treasures within and beyond the Apricot Realm just for you, to have you obey me, could I?</p><p>Ah! No more, I am addicted to The Divine, I want to scream, twist, squirm, crawl in the shadows…</p><p>Ah! Xiang Yaoyao, you and I are sworn enemies!</p><p>“What’s wrong with you?” The Divine looked at Xu Xiaoshou, who suddenly clutched his head in a spasm, and frowned.</p><p>Elder Sang quickly stepped forward and interjected casually:</p><p>“He is having an episode.”</p><p>He probably knew what this rebellious disciple was thinking at the time.</p><p>But the path of controlling The Divine, apart from Xiang Yaoyao, no one else up to now really had a clue, not even Bazhun’an.</p><p>Some thoughts are better kept in the mind, bottled up inside, definitely not to be spoken aloud.</p><p>“Four Scarifice, what is it?” Elder Sang asked on his behalf.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was jolted back to alertness, his legs no longer shaky, he looked at The Divine with earnest seriousness, all of him eager to learn.</p><p>This apparently wasn’t a topic that could be discussed openly in front of everyone… Xu Xiaoshou grimly wanted to clear everyone out of the room, including Yue Gongli.</p><p>However, The Divine spoke unhesitatingly:</p><p>“A person is like a famed sword, naturally self-concealed, awakening through acupoint stimulation, unlocking layers towards Heavenly Unravel.”</p><p>“Nine Palaces Eight Doors Seven Constellations Six Paths—is about the external, the combat power that can be externalized.”</p><p>“Four Scarifice Three Realms Two Forms One Venerate—is about the internal, focusing on metaphysical comprehension and transcendence, with little left to externalize.”</p><p>“These latter four, compared to the previous four, are actually not that significant for most people because reaching them is a lifetime struggle.”</p><p>“Thus, there is no concept of completing them to have fully traversed the path of ancient martial arts.”</p><p>“Conversely, having learned the Six Paths, one has essentially mastered ninety percent of ancient martial arts.”</p><p>The Divine looked intently at Xu Xiaoshou, preemptively correcting any misconceptions a novice might hold.</p><p>This way…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou then suddenly realized, according to his own logic, completing the Four Scarifice and Three Realms might indeed make one comparable to the Ancestral God.</p><p>Two Forms One Venerate?</p><p>What a joke!</p><p>To dominate the five regions, ascended to Feather Ascension Divine Realm already!</p><p>The onlookers nodded their heads, each reflecting on what was said, recording and learning what they should, yet all waiting for the crux of the matter.</p><p>So, the Four Scarifice… Yue Gongli too looked on with anticipation.</p><p>Like most others, he now had only one thought:</p><p>“Perhaps, I also possess the stature of Ancient Martial The Divine?”</p><p>The Divine, of course, caught every look from the crowd, but could only sigh in resignation.</p><p>Similar words, how many times had he said them before, taught them before.</p><p>During the period of the Ten High Nobles, when some sought battle under the guise of seeking advice, he was generous with his words, teaching all he could.</p><p>But…</p><p>Ancient martial arts, the threshold is indeed too high!</p><p>“Four Scarifice, the intent of Sacrifice.”</p><p>“This realm touches on ‘discerning Self, transcending Tao,’ divided into Sacrifice Body, Sacrifice Spirit, Sacrifice Intent, Sacrifice Self.”</p><p>“Body, Spirit, Intent, Self, all forsaken, in the Taoization, returns to its true origins.”</p><p>Pausing, under the expectant gazes of all, The Divine stopped there.</p><p>Yue Gongli, fearing he might forget, urged by some force, neglected his jade scroll and instead took out an ancient bamboo scroll to record.</p><p>At that pause from The Divine, he was like the most studious pupil in school, for a quiet moment, raised his head.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paused as well.</p><p>The Divine looked at him, with no continuation in sight.</p><p>It was as if he understood something, his mouth twitching as he said:</p><p>“Is that all?”</p><p>The Divine nodded.</p><p>“That’s all.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face immediately fell.</p><p>He knew The Divine wouldn’t teach much, wasn’t a good teacher.</p><p>But during the time of the Human Realm Dao and Hungry Ghost Path, he did say quite a lot, right?</p><p>An incantation would suffice, at least after listening I could ponder and gain some insights!</p><p>Now what?</p><p>The more difficult it gets, the more brief you are?</p><p>Just explaining the concept of “Four Scarifice” and that’s it?</p><p>“Things of intent are hard to convey by words, they must be taught by example,” The Divine felt somewhat apologetic.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
