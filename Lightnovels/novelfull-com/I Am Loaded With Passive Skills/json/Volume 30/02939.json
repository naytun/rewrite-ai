2939: Chapter 1542: Two-faced Anxious Creature, Mr. Dialogue Who Am I</p><p>“Swoosh.”</p><p>The branch wriggled.</p><p>This demi-saint, who had bizarrely entered and only faced the underworld briefly, was sucked dry.</p><p>Vitality, soul, and will… all of it dimly vanished.</p><p>Even the life diagram, which represented the possibility of revival, turned to a withered color in an instant and then crumbled like a wilting flower.</p><p>“Dead, dead?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi died, and Abyss Island mourned for the saint.</p><p>This one, without even making a sound of Saint Fall, directly disappeared from sight?</p><p>Such a scene was nothing if not shocking!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s soles were sweating as he stared dumbfounded at the branch that had fed on the demi-saint and then withdrew after its feast.</p><p>That fleeting demi-saint person also got wrapped by the branch, never to be seen again.</p><p>“Really in vain?”</p><p>Until now, Xu Xiaoshou could not accept what he had seen.</p><p>This is a demi-saint!</p><p>This is a demi-saint person!</p><p>You do not see how many people on Abyss Island, for a slim Sealing Saint opportunity, dart into the fray like moths to flame, without questioning the outcome.</p><p>Even Jiang Buyi couldn’t resist the temptation, in order to protect himself, voluntarily gave up the Northern Region base, unveiled the long-term layout of The Three Loathsome Eyes, ventured alone into dangerous territories, and ultimately… met his end.</p><p>You do not see, just for a single demi-saint person, Sword Immortal Gu Yu would come out of retirement, willingly be subordinate, and turn into a lackey.</p><p>He even made choices that defied his own free will, acted against his own path, and after an awakening revelation at the last moment used a Sword Opening Mystical Gate, bidding farewell to this world.</p><p>But now?</p><p>This uninvited demi-saint guest, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even get a clear look at his face, nor did he understand his name well.</p><p>The person came.</p><p>The person was gone.</p><p>He died cleaner and quicker than slicing through fruit!</p><p>“Di Ying Holy Plant’s illusion?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, shocked and doubtful, turned to look at Yue Gongli and seeing the expression even sterner than his own, realized it was not so.</p><p>What he saw was reality!</p><p>Within this divine palace in its infancy, under the power of the Di Ying Holy Plant, he was still making the best out of a bad situation because, at the worst, there was still Independence to barely save his life.</p><p>Yue Gongli could still jest and laugh because he certainly had his trump cards, being a successor of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>But ordinary demi-saints didn’t!</p><p>There was already a threshold between demi-saints and the Holy Emperor.</p><p>Between Low Realm Holy Emperors and High Realm Holy Emperors, the difference was like between mud and clouds.</p><p>Not to mention under the judgment of Moon Fox, the Di Ying Holy Plant showed signs of reaching Ancestral God levels, also undergoing demonic transformation.</p><p>Ordinary demi-saints coming here were truly delivering themselves!</p><p>Swifter than prematurely delivering oneself into higher void, without even a chance to scream!</p><p>“Where’s the Dao Infant?”</p><p>Yue Gongli, seeing the demi-saint sucked dry in an instant, seemed to remember something abruptly yelled, “Where’s my child?”</p><p>“How should I know, it’s not my child!” Xu Xiaoshou panicked upon hearing this.</p><p>“How could you possibly not know, you threw me back, didn’t my child end up in your hands?”</p><p>With that, Xu Xiaoshou really remembered.</p><p>In the previous emergency, after he threw back the Moon Fox, he was nearly tempted by that guy’s fruit child, then got struck by the Di Ying Holy Plant, and turned into the Ultimate Giant.</p><p>After sweeping a path to survival with one slap, he intended to turn back to Yue Gongli to seek cooperation first, then discuss other matters…</p><p>Then he got completely silenced by a call of “Mom!”</p><p>Child?</p><p>What child!</p><p>With “mom” upfront, what did the child matter at that time!</p><p>And now, thinking carefully…</p><p>“Your kid wasn’t taken by anyone, so it must have fallen on the ground!”</p><p>Yue Gongli staggered upon hearing this, his vitality and vigor all scattered by a third, “Dammit, was it eaten too?”</p><p>Perfectly balanced fruit by the Power of Three Ancestors, eaten by the Di Ying Holy Plant?</p><p>It also ate the demi-saint person?</p><p>And ate a demi-saint?</p><p>This Evil Tree, is it trying to defy the heavens!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou worriedly thought, suddenly wondering, if they had cooperated fully from the moment they entered this Ancestral Trees’ divine palace, attacking together, would the outcome have been vastly different?</p><p>Trump cards.</p><p>Everyone reveals a bit, which is equivalent to not revealing anything.</p><p>Better than constantly being beaten by the Ancestor Tree and turning around to find out that neither had ever struck back seriously, always worried about standing too forward, afraid of being backstabbed by the other…</p><p>Yue Gongli also seemed to think of this point, just as he turned his head, also intending to say something.</p><p>But as their gazes met, both fell silent.</p><p>It was utterly impractical!</p><p>Cooperate?</p><p>Trust?</p><p>To entrust each other with their backs?</p><p>To say is one thing, but I’d have to have been kicked in the head by a donkey to believe this person wouldn’t backstab me!</p><p>“Roar…”</p><p>From behind the Yin Coffin in the battlefield, came the voice brimming with combat spirit from the Void Giant Master, but it was finally quieting down.</p><p>As expected, by the end of the battle, the Heavenly Ancestor’s Power surged up the branch of the Di Ying Holy Plant.</p><p>Like the final straw that broke the camel’s back.</p><p>The Void Giant Master completely lost its ability to resist, becoming like that demi-saint, a plaything, turned into a nutrient supply station for the Di Ying Saint.</p><p>“Glug! Glug!”</p><p>Large gulps of energy, through the happily bulging branches of the Ancestral Tree, flowed into the depths of the underworld.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, Yue Gongli, each of them got goosebumps.</p><p>At this moment, the Void Giant Master was their foreseeable future.</p><p>This point, as long as our brains aren’t rusting, could be seen clearly by everyone.</p><p>“Cooperate!”</p><p>“Let’s fully cooperate, all right?”</p><p>“Yes, no more squabbling, we must trust each other!”</p><p>“Definitely!”</p><p>“This is the only way out, I’ll count to three, and we’ll rush out of the Yin Coffin together to fight her, all right?”</p><p>“Okay!”</p><p>“One, two, three, charge!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A loud sound, the coffin lid was kicked open.</p><p>But inside it was eerily silent, not even a single shadow burst out.</p><p>Instead, as the lid of the coffin was being placed back, a huge figure rushed in.</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
