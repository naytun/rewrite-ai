Without power, everyone is a gentleman!</p><p>I am now Lord Shou!</p><p>What grade are you, what position do I hold?</p><p>You dare slice at my head, I’ll blow yours up! Still think about running?</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>On the opposite side, Li Fugui froze as he stared at that extraordinarily ordinary face.</p><p>Could this be my long-lost sister? Why is she so ordinary too!</p><p>Such a face, a dime a dozen on the street, what answer could I give to Lord Shou within ten breaths?</p><p>It’s obviously a fake face?</p><p>It’s better not to say anything!</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>Suddenly, Li Fugui’s eyes lit up, falling on the dagger in the hands of the person dressed as a man…</p><p>“Dark Division Chief, Nian!”</p><p>Upon uttering these words, the second true body was stunned.</p><p>I haven’t given any information yet, and with this passerby face, you could recognize it as the Dark Division Chief?</p><p>The Dark Division Chief, not changing faces when on a mission?</p><p>A thunderbolt struck through Li Fugui’s mind, feeling like everything was clear now.</p><p>Why Lord Shou was clutching his throat…</p><p>Why he might have been sent out of the ruins…</p><p>A covert attack that even the third realm battle consciousness couldn’t stop…</p><p>If it was this assassin, indeed, she could achieve it, even kill a demi-saint with one strike!</p><p>But clearly, this time…</p><p>She messed up.</p><p>She successfully angered a bizarre Lord Shou!</p><p>Li Fugui, spouting like a family treasure, rambled on:</p><p>“Nian, a Tri-color Hunting Order Assassin known as ‘One Strike Kill’, her claim to fame was the successful assassination of the demi-saint Chong Ling, demi-saint Yun Jian.”</p><p>“After Ye Xiao’s death, Nian served as the Dark Division Chief. Her first appearance on the sacred mountain was as a woman, and she had joined a Heavenly Group operation.”</p><p>Upon saying this, Li Fugui paused: “Lord Shou should know that when Hallmaster Dao was in power, the chiefs of the six divisions all used the Heavenly Group operation, but this one never appeared…”</p><p>“That’s right…” The second true body was clueless.</p><p>“Because she is ‘One Strike Kill,’ she only takes action once, in the moment when the prey is weakest,” Li Fugui hesitated as he said.</p><p>The second true body was not foolish, and after a brief thought, he exploded in anger: “That damn flamboyant Elder Dao, planted this mine early on waiting for me, yet did not take action?”</p><p>“It seems so, but at the last step, he was suddenly sent out of the game by his sister, the covert force probably just took the opportunity to hide,” Li Fugui was shocked, “I did not expect that she turned into the ruins…”</p><p>Damn!</p><p>The second true body was briefly bewildered.</p><p>He recalled carefully, if Dao Xuanji hadn’t intervened, the most vulnerable moment for my main body would have been when Dao Qiongcang entered the Apricot Realm, and my main body was carried back to Changde Town by Dragon Apricot…</p><p>What danger could be in the small town?</p><p>Nian, waiting there for me?</p><p>Just an assassin, even with demi-saint combat power… oh yes, at that time I didn’t yet have the Life Upanishad, the Spatial Upanishad, the Way of the Sword Upanishad, still weak and unawakened, indeed possibly susceptible to “One Strike Kill”…</p><p>The second true body had an epiphany, quickly regained his composure, and, looking at Li Fugui with surprise, said: “You are so familiar with Nian?”</p><p>Aunt Xiang couldn’t provide much information.</p><p>Yet she is just under the eyes at Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe!</p><p>Li Fugui gave a wry smile: “The information about Nian, if you try to find it now, not a word can be found. I’ve been keeping an eye on her because when she was very young, she almost became my person…”</p><p>What?</p><p>The second true body was dumbfounded.</p><p>Li Fugui, were you originally a beast?</p><p>After Li Fugui said this, he also paused, hurriedly shaking his head: “Not in that way, Lord Shou, not that kind of ‘my person.’ Fugui meant to say, she almost became my subordinate.”</p><p>Oh, like that Ai Gou… Ni Cai the same?</p><p>Li Fugui took a deep breath, aware that time was pressing, and continued:</p><p>“Nian is an orphan who, at a very young age, contracted with a special dagger and exhibited a strong killer talent.”</p><p>“That dagger was too powerful! It’s my fault I didn’t recognize it immediately, didn’t give it the attention it deserved… She didn’t have cultivation level, hadn’t trained much, but purely relying on that dagger, she successfully devoured the memories of my guards, perhaps even mine, and ran away from the training ground at Flower Pavilion…”</p><p>Li Fugui sighed silently: “Who would have thought, after going round and round, she still ended up on the path of an assassin.”</p><p>The second true body followed Li Fugui’s gaze towards the gold and silver intertwined dagger in the hands of the conjured image of Nian.</p><p>Li Fugui’s expression became serious, and he emphatically said:</p><p>“Memory Returning Dagger, one of the nine supreme divine weapons.”</p><p>“Along with Ai Gou’s Evil Sin Bow, and now in the hands of Water Ghost’s Original Sealing Spear, among others.”</p><p>“Its ability is, if it gets within a palm’s distance from the enemy, it can devour their next moment’s thoughts.”</p><p>“Once it cuts through the skin, it can further devour the memory of that instant when struck, leaving the person completely unaware.”</p><p>“Memory Returning, Memory Returning, implies that after one strike with the dagger, it restores the victim’s good thoughts before death, in essence, making them feel no pain at all.”</p><p>Li Fugui clicked his tongue, while looking over, his tone filled with a hint of lament:</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
