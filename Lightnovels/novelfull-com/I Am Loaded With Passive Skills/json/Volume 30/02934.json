People are really going to die now. If you kill me, the Di Ying Holy Plant will also devour my power, and in the end, the only ones who will die are you and me!”</p><p>Oh?</p><p>Your demi-saint incarnation can’t contact you either? What a coincidence, mine neither.</p><p>With that said, Xu Xiaoshou truly believed Yue Gongli… zero percent.</p><p>“Sorry, the only one who will die is you, not me.”</p><p>“You arrogant fool! You conceited brat! How do I make you believe me… ”</p><p>Yue Gongli was on the verge of madness, and suddenly fixed his thoughts, calming down as he said, “The Di Ying Holy Plant has devoured the Ancestral God Fate Chart. It wants to meddle in the true mysteries of the god-slayer lineage, aiming for the Ancestral God Realm. We have to stop her!”</p><p>The Ultimate Giant’s finger power finally paused, and then continued with increased ferocity, “Heroes think alike, let’s get moving first.”</p><p>“You are sick! You are brain-dead! Xu Xiaoshou, you are a madman! Even if I die, don’t think you’ll have it easy… ”</p><p>Yue Gongli really went mad, and even Xu Xiaoshou didn’t expect that this guy, while cursing, pushed off the coffin lid himself, stretching out a long ice blade and fiercely chopping it down on the Ultimate Giant’s fingers.</p><p>Like an ant shaking a tree.</p><p>The ice blade was shattered.</p><p>Yue Gongli, frightened, trembled and shrank back into the coffin, closing the lid, “You are going to anger me to death! You are going to anger me to death! You are going to… ”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Just then, that strange sound, which had disappeared for a long time and suddenly reappeared at his side, abruptly erupted.</p><p>“Ambushed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Caught by the corner of the Ultimate Giant’s eye, a dark brown branch as thick as his own head, carrying an extremely greedy, hungry, mad, and vengeful emotion, stabbed towards his head.</p><p>Intent!</p><p>It was that intent that was detectable in the beginning, present within the Dark Forest.</p><p>Realizing it was no longer in control of itself, it retreated to the deepest part of the forest to hide.</p><p>And now, seeing internal strife, seeing the strength of the Ultimate Giant, it couldn’t help but come out again, launching a deadly strike?</p><p>The Ultimate Giant, though large, was extremely agile.</p><p>He immediately tilted his head and twirled his feet, taking the easy way out to position himself behind while simultaneously flinging the coffin at his fingertips into the air.</p><p>Then he pushed out with a hand!</p><p>The giant palm covered the Yin Coffin.</p><p>The dark brown branch, filled with intent and vengeance, also struck the Yin Coffin at its tip.</p><p>The two massive forces collided thunderously.</p><p>The Yin Coffin in the middle, merely an ornament, caught in the midst of catastrophe, became the filling sandwiched between two massive buns.</p><p>“Ahhh—”</p><p>Yue Gongli covered his head, issuing a scream even more penetrating than that of the Di Ying Holy Plant.</p><p>Smack.</p><p>Without any suspense.</p><p>The coffin lid was slammed flat.</p><p>The Yin Coffin also became flattened.</p><p>As the terrifying storms from left and right pushed over, even before touching his self, Yue Gongli’s eyeballs were both squeezing towards the center, becoming flattened.</p><p>The Six Marrow Corpse King straightened from the coffin, unable to see the situation due to the lack of eyes, it let out a sound that was inappropriate for the occasion, but indeed typical of one without a brain.</p><p>“Ho?”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A dazzling, brilliant white light burst forth beneath the buttocks of the Six Marrow Corpse King, slapping it against the flesh wall of the Ultimate Giant’s palm with a smack.</p><p>“Roar—”</p><p>A fierce howl rose up in the heaven and earth.</p><p>The dark brown Ancestor Tree branch and the Ultimate Giant’s palm were suddenly pushed apart!</p><p>—A giant corpse, ghastly pale in color, resembling a void attendant enlarged by a thousand, ten thousand times, with one palm pushing the Ancestor Tree Branch and the other palm pushing the Ultimate Giant, forcibly separated the two!</p><p>“Roar!!!”</p><p>The blast of air surged.</p><p>The branches of the Di Ying Holy Plant were blitzed away in retreat.</p><p>The Ultimate Giant felt the power in the palm of his hand being sucked dry by the void attendant, even the Recoil Force was sucked away, and it, too, was pushed back half a step.</p><p>“Ah~ oh…”</p><p>The mighty and pure power of the Heavenly Ancestor dispersed, as if to dye this underworld realm into a land only overseen by the Heavenly Ancestor.</p><p>This was simply taunting on the Di Ying Holy Plant’s ground, proclaiming “I am the king”!</p><p>Standing atop the giant corpse’s head, Yue Gongli, now only had his hands cupping his cheeks, incessantly shaking his head:</p><p>“I said don’t mess with it, don’t mess with it.”</p><p>“Now look, the Void Giant Master has awakened…”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
