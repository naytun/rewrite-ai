This creature, can it rely on absorbing its own power to form the most balanced, perfect state of Dao Infant Self?”</p><p>After staring at the Corpse King baby in its hands for a while, the Corpse King suddenly lifted it to its face, opening its wide maw within the Heart of Marrow Absorption, preparing to devour it.</p><p>“Hold your tongue!”</p><p>Yue Gongli swung his sword directly downward.</p><p>He dared not let the Six Marrow Corpse King consume this creature!</p><p>For within the body of the Dao Infant Corpse King baby, he had discovered a force that the Six Marrow Corpse King did not naturally possess…</p><p>“Power of the evil god!”</p><p>Through the eyes of a successor of the Holy Emperor:</p><p>Ancestral Power, power of the evil god—these were two different types of ancestral strength!</p><p>And as everyone knows, it’s difficult for a normal person to stabilize two major ancestral powers within their body simultaneously.</p><p>The Six Marrow Corpse King, refined with Divine Power, would most likely…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Before the baby could reach its mouth.</p><p>Yue Gongli kicked away the Yin Coffin and with a fierce chop of his sword, struck the Six Marrow Corpse King on its head, causing it to cry out in pain.</p><p>But the explosion came from somewhere else!</p><p>In the distance of the Dark Forest, a sudden shadow shot straight toward his face.</p><p>Even though it was fast, Yue Gongli’s saint’s will still cleared up the identity of this strange creature:</p><p>A head of a human, a body of a wolf, limbs made of black writhing branches…</p><p>“What is this thing!”</p><p>Yue Gongli’s worldview was shattered.</p><p>As a person who appreciated beauty, he could accept the “ugly beauty” of the Corpse King baby, but he couldn’t accept this strange “stitched beauty!”</p><p>The nauseating monster resembling a mix of human, wolf, and tree had collided with the head of the Six Marrow Corpse King.</p><p>While the Yue Gongli’s sword had caused the Corpse King to fall into a stupor and stagger with pain, clutching its head, the monster snatched away the Corpse King’s baby…</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The mother of the Six Marrow Corpse King was enraged!</p><p>Yet the monster, with its gaping maw wide open, paid no extra attention to anything else, focusing solely on the Corpse King’s baby…</p><p>“Gurgle!”</p><p>The Dao Infant of the Corpse King was swallowed in one bite!</p><p>“Roar Roar Roar Roar Roar—”</p><p>The Six Marrow Corpse King exploded on the spot.</p><p>The face, bereft of facial features and expressions but having only a Heart of Marrow Absorption, distinctly displayed overwhelming fury and a destructive mood.</p><p>As a mother…</p><p>At this moment, there was not a moment of hesitation in the Corpse King!</p><p>It almost teleported in front of the monster and slapped it fiercely with its palm.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The sky shattered and the earth split apart.</p><p>The Dark Forest beneath this palm was smashed into a thousand-mile radius.</p><p>Immediately after, trees shattered from all directions, large-bellied birds sent flying, and countless Suture Monsters enveloping the area were simultaneously crushed and sent skyward.</p><p>“Ao ao ao—”</p><p>From afar, countless shrieks were rapidly approaching.</p><p>Clearly, these were the howls that the Suture Monsters couldn’t release before dying!</p><p>One stone stirred up a thousand ripples.</p><p>The entire Dark Forest, from silence to madness, needed only a slap!</p><p>As Yue Gongli’s saint’s will swept over the thousands of Suture Monsters swarming like a tide, he realized something and exclaimed in shock:</p><p>“Are they all attracted by the power of the Dao Infant?”</p><p>“No, they’re all attracted by the perfectly balanced Power of Divinity!”</p><p>“Di Ying Holy Plant…”</p><p>He fell into deep thought, his hand subconsciously rubbing his chin, his eyebrows nearly twisted together.</p><p>Numerous monsters swarmed, but Yue Gongli remained unmoved.</p><p>In the end, as if he had made a decision, he looked around, saw no one else, and nodded heavily, patting the Six Marrow Corpse King, saying:</p><p>“Kill them, protect me well.”</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Six Marrow Corpse King, distressed by the pain of losing its child, responded loudly and exuberantly, flipping into an upside-down stance and walking chaotically.</p><p>“Thud.”</p><p>The Yin Coffin was placed on the ground.</p><p>Yue Gongli, with a swollen belly, lay on the huge coffin.</p><p>The look of fear and horror was on his face, but his expression was resolute, and the Yin Cold Blade formed by the Power of Divinity, still not receded, was held high.</p><p>“Roar Roar Roar!”</p><p>The Six Marrow Corpse King, flailing its limbs, circled the coffin, slapping and sending numerous Suture Monsters flying with each palm.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Yue Gongli pursed his lips, psyching himself up, and aimed the Yin Blue Blade at his now swollen belly again.</p><p>“Come on, come on, come on!”</p><p>He let out a series of loud shouts, seemingly using volume to dispel fear.</p><p>Because this time, the blade was not aimed at the Dao Infant inside his belly, but at his stomach skin.</p><p>“Bang Bang Bang!”</p><p>The Dark Forest quaked and trembled incessantly.</p><p>Occasionally, countless fragments of ancient trees were blasted into the air, and fragments of corpses were flipped into the sky.</p><p>“Ah ah ah—”</p><p>The screams mixed in this chaos were already negligible.</p><p>The wave of attacks by the Suture Monsters grew increasingly fierce, as if something more tempting than the Corpse King’s baby was about to be born.</p><p>The Six Marrow Corpse King was nearly unable to withstand such an onslaught, its thirty-foot-tall figure almost being submerged by the monsters.</p><p>But soon…</p><p>“Ah—”</p><p>With a final cry of pain, the noise around the protected area of the Corpse King abruptly stopped.</p><p>“Through!”</p><p>Countless flying monsters were suddenly frozen by the Yin Cold, and the world seemed to have stopped.</p><p>“Ho?”</p><p>The Six Marrow Corpse King, confused, withdrew its palm; the monsters had suddenly stopped attacking?</p><p>It turned its head, “looked” towards the position beneath it.</p><p>On the Yin Coffin, Yue Gongli lay half sideways, blood under his buttocks, a handsome face with a touch of maternal gentleness, his fox eyes intently staring at the newly carved out Yue Gongli’s baby in his hands.</p><p>“My heavens…”</p><p>The newly born Dao Infant Yue Gongli was ugly, weighing six pounds.</p><p>The distribution of internal power was perfect: two pounds of Power of Divinity, two pounds of Heavenly Ancestor’s Power, and two pounds of power of the evil god.</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
