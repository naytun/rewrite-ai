The Fourth Sword, by a stroke of luck, stopped just a hair’s breadth from his throat.</p><p>Yue Gongli’s eyes drooped, and in a frightened and astonished tone, he said, “Master! This is a master! Aiming for the back of my head, I was saying that’s how you should swing a sword, so it wouldn’t be dodged…”</p><p>He predicted my prediction?</p><p>A coincidence?</p><p>No way it’s a coincidence!</p><p>Being not the brightest, Xu Xiaoshou still realized that this man was a tricky individual, a truly cunning character!</p><p>Elder Dao the Flamboyant was cunning in devising schemes, laying plans, and in embodying that indescribable cunning sensation.</p><p>Yue Gongli was sheer cunning in himself. The Fourth Sword had reached his face, and yet his mouth hadn’t stopped.</p><p>Not only could he react in time, but he could also act, even displaying such a fragile demeanor…</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>This seems so familiar!</p><p>Where have I seen this kind of person before?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou intended to change his fighting tactic after hearing from Li Fugui that this guy was not only talkative but also frivolous. He thought to draw his sword without a word and catch him off guard…</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>Why am I fighting him here?</p><p>Shouldn’t I deal with Nian first?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that something was amiss, as if he had forgotten something, yet he couldn’t quite remember it…</p><p>“Information Bar!”</p><p>He was no longer the Xu Xiaoshou of the past.</p><p>A thought from the second true body transmitted over, and without further words, he looked at the Information Bar:</p><p>“Received guidance, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Affected by oblivion, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>When did the silent and profound power of the Holy Emperor’s Guidance and the force of oblivion show up, in person, concretely, clearly, and in real-time!</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou gripped his sword and looked up at Yue Gongli again, he somewhat grasped the reminder from Li Fugui.</p><p>Successor of the Holy Emperor!</p><p>Just one phrase, “I am willing,” away from becoming one of the five paramount beings of this world!</p><p>This meant he had learned everything.</p><p>Aside from not being a Holy Emperor in realm, should he be treated like one?</p><p>But…</p><p>“Let me tell you!”</p><p>“If it weren’t for the sake of Bazhun’an’s face, since he was on good terms with my big sister, I would have really fought back when that sword came stabbing at me.”</p><p>“It’s only because you’re called Xu Xiaoshou, and your character and actions quite suit my taste, that I didn’t mind. I’ve also been annoyed with Dao Xuanji for a long time, so when you step on her name outside, just step on it. I will verbally defend her but that’s all there is to it.”</p><p>“Although our positions differ, by stabbing you once with the Memory Returning Dagger, I can at least have something to report back. In my opinion, we might as well let bygones be bygones and we can shake hands and make up, following the cordial and congenial relationship like that of Hua Yubing and Wen Meiyu to become close friends who can share a great expanse of white…”</p><p>Yue Gongli raised the gourd and said magnanimously, “I’ll bring out a flask of wine, and you just need to bring a person and a mouth to talk, how about it?”</p><p>But!</p><p>Looking at that face and listening to those words, Xu Xiaoshou really couldn’t muster the enthusiasm that this was a conversation with a master!</p><p>Suddenly, he felt alarmed, suspecting something…</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>I finally realized why people like Yi, Senior Rao Yaoyao, Jiang Buyi, and even Dao Xuanji have always looked down on me!</p><p>Is it this kind of feeling?</p><p>The kind where you know it, and even when you see it in person, you still kind of can’t believe it?</p><p>“Not drinking?” Yue Gongli saw the young man across from her freeze and after a snort, she said:</p><p>“You don’t look down on me, do you?”</p><p>“Even Bazhun’an have drunk with me!”</p><p>“When I bring out this gourd, even Sky City gives me some respect, and even if it’s…”</p><p>“Shut up! Moon Fox!” Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t take it anymore; how could someone be so noisy?</p><p>He felt as though he had just remembered something, only to have it forgotten again.</p><p>“Nian!”</p><p>The second true body was indeed very useful.</p><p>The Memory Returning Dagger hadn’t reached him yet.</p><p>Guidance, the power of oblivion, perhaps it was because they were separated by the Divine Relics, or perhaps Yue Gongli’s strength was insufficient, or perhaps he, Xu Xiaoshou, had really acquired a high resistance, and it couldn’t reach his second true body.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou broke out in a cold sweat of alarm, realizing he had been led astray by Yue Gongli again.</p><p>I must not underestimate her words…</p><p>I should treat them as if they were Hallmaster Dao’s, or even as if they were my own…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly turned his head, looking toward the distant Dragon Melting Realm outside.</p><p>Never fight without a reason!</p><p>This stalling must be for someone, if not for oneself!</p><p>Sure enough…</p><p>Even if someone were to escape from Path Principles and pull away from the exiled space, they would have to be tainted with the white flame, alerting the Spatial Upanishad.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou discovered that outside in the distant Dragon Melting Realm, there was a plain and unadorned figure of a man, whose aura of white flame had been completely extinguished, and not even a trace had been brought from the exiled space…</p><p>On him, there were also faint remnants of the Yin attribute!</p><p>Undoubtedly…</p><p>Nian had escaped!</p><p>Tainted with white flame and alerting the spatial elements, yet he had managed to forget about it himself!</p><p>And this mark, Yue Gongli had been delaying time, shifting his attention, all while helping him erase it!</p><p>“Not bad…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled.</p><p>“Er.”</p><p>The constant chatter from Yue Gongli’s mouth involuntarily ceased, and she smack her lips, “That’s no fun, show some respect…”</p><p>Before she could finish.</p><p>Her eyes clouded with a cold chill, breaking through the visual and spiritual senses blockade of the Dragon Melting Realm, and her gaze fell upon that figure of Nian outside the realm…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The golden light materialized!</p><p>The Berserk Giant stepped down like crushing an ant, directly exploding Nian into fine powder.</p><p>Within the Dragon Melting Realm, the fading afterimage of the youth in black finally dissipated.</p><p>“So… violent…”</p><p>Yue Gongli’s mouth dropped open, her gaze still not pulled back, suddenly she felt something and sharply looked up.</p><p>The golden, gigantic foot, stained with blood and starlight, expanded to its limit in her pupils.</p><p>“Ah… oh…”</p><p>Yue Gongli didn’t even move.</p><p>An echo reached her ears belatedly.</p><p>“Time is up!”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
