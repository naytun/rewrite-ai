My only option now is to retreat!</p><p>“Creak—”</p><p>A tightening of the fist, and the Dragon Painting Spear was raised high.</p><p>The intense pressure from across did not crush Taizai Ci; instead, it quickened the flow of blood within him.</p><p>A force that seemed to ignite from deep within his veins surged forth from an unknown source, quickly filling his limbs and body, as if breaking through some sort of shackles.</p><p>“Roar!!!”</p><p>Taizai Ci let out a bestial roar that sounded inhuman, his eyes reignited with the will to fight, and he suddenly realized he was under the influence of the opponent’s power of guidance.</p><p>He was being guided to retreat, to fall back, to show cowardice, to turn around…</p><p>Once such submission took hold, the storm that would follow would be brutal and relentless, and by then, far from being able to counter, he would not even have the breath to catch.</p><p>However, descendants of the God of War do not know the path of fear in battle.</p><p>How could the Giant’s Moment of Enlightenment truly be without a counter in this world?</p><p>“Heave!”</p><p>A swing of the Dragon Painting Spear, and the vast lands shattered to pieces.</p><p>Taizai Ci’s hundred-feet frame soared even higher, all his qi and blood beginning to burn, hissing forth tendrils of black mist.</p><p>“Blood of the God of War, ignite!”</p><p>“Stance of the God of War, activate!”</p><p>Rumble rumble rumble—</p><p>With a thunderous battle cry, circles of black qi waves rolled out, twisting the space around them layer by layer.</p><p>Suddenly from the underground, a massive black qi pillar shot up, engulfing the Thousand Feet Taizai Ci like a volcanic eruption.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>His fierce gaze scouring all around.</p><p>That energy broke apart forcefully again, turning into strands of writhing Demonic Emperor Black Dragons that coiled around his armored limbs.</p><p>In this moment, with the Dragon Painting Spear slanted towards the earth, Taizai Ci was the embodiment of the God of War, invincible!</p><p>…</p><p>“Retreat, retreat, retreat!”</p><p>Elder Sang waved his hands frantically, shouting for the saints nearby to quickly distance themselves from the battlefield:</p><p>“The activation of the Blood of the God of War means the strongest form has been unleashed.”</p><p>“The Innate Ancestral Power simply isn’t something that can be compared with Acquired Upanishad, talent… Tch!”</p><p>Talent is truly a despairing thing.</p><p>Leaving aside the Ten High Nobles, Taizai Ci merely achieved sanctification and awakened the God of War Bloodline.</p><p>While he himself had worked hard for many years, after so much sweat poured into mastering the power of the Upanishad, he was still unable to reach the threshold of battle.</p><p>“To fight against Taizai Ci in this form…”</p><p>Elder Sang and Water Ghost both felt it deeply; it would probably take Upanishad power at the level of Super Taoization.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could give it a shot.</p><p>They could not even attempt it—for them, an attempt meant death.</p><p>“You have the Fire Upanishad and Penetrating Divine Senses 2.0, you could actually try and lend him a hand,” Bai Zhou suggested, his eyes craftily turning towards Elder Sang.</p><p>Talent was indeed a disgusting thing, all being initial Saints but you already have the Penetrating Divine Senses which could compare to the ancestral source power.</p><p>Indeed, during the time of Sovereign’s enlightenment on the Formal Path, proper enlightenment was crucial.</p><p>—Youth who do not seek the Path, demi-saints only to grief.</p><p>Hearing this, Elder Sang looked towards Xu Xiaoshou and sneered: “Me help him? I’m afraid that in his madness, he might strike me down as well!”</p><p>He knew more than anyone the extent of Xu Xiaoshou’s craziness.</p><p>Even the avenues of tolerance and magnanimity that the ‘bottom’ takes, originated from him, how could Elder Sang not know that this young man was far from simple?</p><p>According to Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>Right now, Taizai Ci was being pushed to his limit.</p><p>But who would have thought that Xu Xiaoshou could so quickly push Taizai Ci to that point?</p><p>And a person capable of easily driving someone to their limits, their own limit was unfathomable.</p><p>So, when was it ever the time to lend Xu Xiaoshou a hand?</p><p>The time now was to be careful not to end up like Mrs. Serpent and the Twelve Holy Lords, becoming deadweight for Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>Water Ghost also looked over.</p><p>His words were very direct, causing Bai Zhou such discomfort:</p><p>“Watch out for yourself, anyway, I probably won’t be the first to die; I am an Upanishad demi-saint.”</p><p>Indeed, the injury is yours, but the pain is mine.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Cen Qiaofu shuddered and ran even faster.</p><p>“Hedgehog, hold him back, I don’t want to end up like Mrs. Serpent under the Dragon Painting Spear!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Locked-on, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Ambushed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Just as Xu Xiaoshou was analyzing whether the electric-like black power emanating from Taizai Ci in his stance as the God of War was indeed the power of Godhood or the Ghostly Beast Aura, the Information Bar suddenly popped up with an “Ambushed” message!</p><p>Now, with 90% control over the Will Dao Disc, even without deliberate training, let alone without the Moment of Enlightenment activated.</p><p>His battle consciousness was not to say the peak of the third realm, at least it should be at great success of the third realm, right?</p><p>In such a scenario, being on caution and still getting an “Ambush” popping up, you can imagine just how fast Taizai Ci must be right now!</p><p>And extreme speed brings forth an equally extreme attack, especially coming from a Raging Giant wielding one of the top ten Great Psionic Weapons?</p><p>The Giant with the halberd made his move, and the heavens and earth dimmed.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Before the figure arrived, the sound preceded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
