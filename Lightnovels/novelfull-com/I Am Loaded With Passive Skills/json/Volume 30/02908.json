You’re just spouting nonsense!</p><p>“Oh, there is…”</p><p>Looking at Xu Xiaoshou who was still, from a distance, savoring the aftertaste of that sword, his nostrils gently flaring and his expression rapt, Zhou Tianshen clenched his fist, holding back his comment.</p><p>Blade Will Pishou Sect, a must!</p><p>Pass down to my descendants for generations, I must beat him once; he’s too much!</p><p>“Boom—”</p><p>The sword energy blossom ground into dust, gone in a moment.</p><p>When the fierce devil power of Fourth Sword built up to an extreme, and even Xu Xiaoshou himself could no longer suppress it, Nian exploded into a bloody mess from cultivation deviation, barely recognizable as human.</p><p>Like Elder Sang after being shot with an arrow.</p><p>“Hmm…”</p><p>Even so.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned his head, looking at the newly appointed Dark Division Chief who was still enduring, emitting only a muffled groan.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Cursed?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyebrows raised.</p><p>Aside from the little junior sister, was there really anyone else who consoled themselves with a curse after a grand battle had ended?</p><p>He was taken aback again.</p><p>It wasn’t a curse like the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, was it?</p><p>Yet his Body, Spirit, and Will were all unharmed, and the Spirit Awakening didn’t report any anomalies.</p><p>And Nian, the non-ancient swordsman pierced by Fourth Sword, clearly had no ability to strike again—was this the loser’s final pride?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Amidst the swirling tendrils of thousand demonic auras, Xu Xiaoshou finally saw the “true face” of the woman disguised as a man.</p><p>Her revealed face was plain.</p><p>Her torn clothes exposed her skin, which wasn’t particularly fair, just bloodied and ordinary.</p><p>The Memory Returning Dagger she clutched revealed itself, and after swiping it across her own neck, she transmitted her calm thoughts telepathically:</p><p>“We will meet again.”</p><p>Nian’s body gradually turned into stardust.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t be bothered to take another glance, turning his head with a smile:</p><p>“Pray that Ran Ming shows great compassion and cleanses you of your filth while sending off your ruins.”</p><p>“Otherwise, when you return home, what awaits you is still chaos.”</p><p>“Oh, by the way!”</p><p>With a grasp, Xu Xiaoshou pulled over Zhou Tianshen’s Big Cloth Bag and included the God Fated Star that no one dared to pick up from the ground.</p><p>With this, the number of God Fated Stars in his possession reached seven.</p><p>“Tell Ai Cangsheng when you go back,”</p><p>“Seven represents departure… with no seventh month festival to unite, humans part with tearful farewells. Tell him, considering the ‘tear’ in this, there’s time to abandon darkness for light.”</p><p>Turning back to face the Dark Division Chief, Xu Xiaoshou finally looked her in the eye.</p><p>Her body had already completely dissipated into stardust, leaving only a pair of eyes that no longer held calm, but a hint of vulnerability and pain.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou barely parted his lips, casually saying:</p><p>“You too.”</p><p>“I know who you are.”</p><p>“Cursed with awe, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>1 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p><p>1</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
