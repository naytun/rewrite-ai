After all, you possess the Heavenly Ancestor’s Power… It was refined using the Heavenly Ancestor’s body,” Yue Gongli said.</p><p>Oh, the Heavenly Ancestor.</p><p>Once Xu Xiaoshou heard that, his mind sparked, suddenly freezing his thoughts and himself, “What did you say? The Heavenly Ancestor?!”</p><p>“Yes, it was refined from one of His index fingers,” Yue Gongli explained.</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was truly bewildered this time.</p><p>Big brother, do you realize what you’re saying?</p><p>The body of the Heavenly Ancestor?</p><p>“Are you joking?”</p><p>He meant to ask that question because after all, this person was full of nonsense, not always reliable.</p><p>But looking at Yue Gongli’s calm and unexceptional facial expression, it was as if he was talking about something as normal and joke-free as eating and drinking.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind struggled to catch up.</p><p>He remembered when Li Fugui talked about Yue Gongli’s characteristics, the first thing mentioned was his wealth, richer even than Hallmaster Dao.</p><p>At the time he hadn’t thought much about it, but now it seemed…</p><p>“Poverty has limited my imagination!”</p><p>While other demi-saints were busy scraping the Great Path like wool, refining Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decrees, or even scraping their own wool, refining an extra demi-saint incarnation to save their lives.</p><p>Yue Gongli, the Holy Emperor’s heir, was playing with what?</p><p>Using Great Psionic Weapons to decorate Great Psionic Weapons, refining the Heavenly Ancestor’s body into a corpse…</p><p>And this was merely the tip of the iceberg of his wealth.</p><p>His wealth was measured like this?</p><p>Not by numbers, not by nothingness.</p><p>But by the Great Psionic Weapons that ordinary people could hardly obtain once in a lifetime, by the body of the Heavenly Ancestor that one couldn’t even dare to imagine in a lifetime?</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes turned red with envy, and suddenly, a left jab punched out, hitting Yue Gongli’s precious face dead-on.</p><p>“What are you doing!”</p><p>Yue Gongli’s nose was almost broken by the blow.</p><p>He felt no killing intent, no hostility; this seemed more like a “greeting”?</p><p>But to be inside the Yin Coffin and start this stunt, why?</p><p>Before Yue Gongli even got angry, he saw Xu Xiaoshou inside the Yin Coffin swinging his fists, jumping a couple of times on the boggy surface:</p><p>“Practice a bit?”</p><p>“They’re fighting outside, shall we spar too?”</p><p>Why?</p><p>Yue Gongli’s mind short-circuited for a moment.</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
