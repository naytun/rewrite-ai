If you had been more direct and forcefully made me enter the Ran Ming ruins, I wouldn’t have so many troubles now!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>Lost in thought, a familiar voice suddenly reached his ears.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu, Yue Gongli, and the others abruptly turned back, and Xu Xiaoshou also swiftly turned around. The scattered crowd around also looked sideways.</p><p>They saw a figure had appeared not far away.</p><p>He was wearing white, tattered prison clothes, dyed pitch-black, his exposed arms charred and thin like two sticks of charcoal, with white firelight faintly flickering in the cracked patterns.</p><p>Not just the arms, but his neck, his feet, any part of his body that was visible outside of the clothing, apart from the face, resembled charred wood.</p><p>“Sleeveless!”</p><p>“Sleeveless Saint Servant!”</p><p>“My heavens, he’s here too, then this place is about to be…”</p><p>Yue Gongli’s eyes flickered as he surveyed the person in front of him.</p><p>Sleeveless, The Divine, Cen Qiaofu, Water Ghost.</p><p>Outsiders might not count The Divine, and they might not be that familiar with Water Ghost.</p><p>Having been half an insider, and having heard plenty of insider information from his big sister over the years, he clearly understood that these individuals right here were the previous highest combat strength configuration of the Saint Servants:</p><p>Saint Servant two, three, four, five in command!</p><p>Oh, the current second in command was now Lord Shou.</p><p>So…</p><p>“Saint Servant Level Five!”</p><p>“If all five of them were slain here, the Saint Servants would lose half their territory in a flash, and Bazhun’an would revert back to the state they were in thirty years ago, unable to achieve anything!”</p><p>But soon, Yue Gongli frowned and vanished into the crowd.</p><p>A wise man does not stand beneath a collapsing wall.</p><p>What he should consider was not whether they could be slain here, but whether he would be killed by them all ganging up on him instead, right?!</p><p>…</p><p>“Old man Sang…”</p><p>Looking back, it seemed as though the roaring of the battlefield had also grown quite distant at this moment.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt as though even the figures around him were fading away, only that unfamiliar yet familiar figure in front of him was becoming clearer.</p><p>Elder Sang had changed!</p><p>He completely transformed into a different appearance!</p><p>Drastically different from the image he had seen in the Higher Void World.</p><p>The simplest way to describe him now was, “Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand” had mutated into “Sleeveless, Red Scorched Body.”</p><p>“How did you turn into this ghostly image?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was grinning, hastened forward wanting to grab the old man’s arm to see for himself.</p><p>It has been a long time!</p><p>Too long indeed!</p><p>Counting it up, excluding the two times in the Higher Void World, this was the first time he had seen Elder Sang since the battle at the Eighth Palace; it felt like ages had passed.</p><p>If the little junior sister were here, she would certainly be crying her eyes out with excitement.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt it was alright though.</p><p>Although it had been a long time, it wasn’t to the exaggerated extent of ‘a single day apart seems like three autumns’ because when all was said and done…</p><p>Elder Sang had been missing for less than a year!</p><p>“One year!”</p><p>“I’ve become this strong!”</p><p>“And you, my Master, how did you end up looking like a ghost, did something go wrong with your cultivation, ha ha cough, hmm.”</p><p>Contrary to his inner thoughts, Xu Xiaoshou bypassed the crowd and arrived in front of Elder Sang, grabbing his clothes and laughing more and more:</p><p>“How did your clothes survive?”</p><p>“Sleeveless, Red Scorched Body? No, it should be No Clothes, Red Scorched Body instead, this material…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickly realized this was no ordinary prison uniform.</p><p>This thing had undergone special refinement, still emitting the charred scent of Elixirs, and even the aroma of Penetrating Divine Senses 2.0 Dragon Melting Burn was inside.</p><p>“Is this a fake garment?”</p><p>“No, this is a genuine garment with a fake aspect, it’s half made from the essence of Penetrating Divine Senses Dragon Melting Burn, which means…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at this man who was obviously shorter than himself, now clearly able to see the bald head, and his eyes widened in surprise as he exclaimed:</p><p>“Are you streaking?”</p><p>Elder Sang, having listened in silence, looked at the young man and his eyes twitched twice, the emotional impact of their long-awaited reunion dissipated entirely.</p><p>He kept telling himself.</p><p>Tolerance, magnanimity…</p><p>It’s not worth it to fuss over things with a young chap, not with so many people watching, beside, it’s not cost-effective, nor dignified, nor honorable.</p><p>“I never wanted it to be like this,” Elder Sang said, shaking his head slightly.</p><p>“What?” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t quite catch the old man’s mumbling.</p><p>“Step back.”</p><p>Elder Sang pointed a finger at this young man’s forehead, then exerted fiercely as if to stab this rebellious disciple to death.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The void exploded into ripples, the ground shattered, and Xu Xiaoshou was forced back several steps, his facial expression slightly shocked.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Before he could speak,</p><p>Elder Sang lifted his chin, and his lips twisted fiendishly as he drew his hand upward.</p><p>Whirr!</p><p>A dazzling light burst forth from beneath him, enveloping everyone around, brilliantly spreading for ten thousand miles with overwhelming momentum.</p><p>Power Upanishad Formation!</p><p>Suddenly, everyone around was in a collective uproar.</p><p>“What? Fire Upanishad?”</p><p>“The Sleeveless Saint Servant grasped the Fire Upanishad?”</p><p>“That’s not right, he he… he doesn’t have any Upanishads. He wasn’t a Sovereign with Upanishads back in his Sovereign stage…”</p><p>“Am I remembering wrong? Who altered my memory? Sleeveless Saint Servant wasn’t supposed to have Fire Upanishads, it was supposed to be the first Upanishad Spiritual Cultivator, Yu Lingdi, wasn’t it?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
