In an instant, the Berserk Giant’s figure disappeared from the world.</p><p>The Twelve Holy Lords, including Sangshui Cenbai, completely lost sight of this man—couldn’t see him at all.</p><p>But in Taizai Ci’s eyes…</p><p>He was the closest!</p><p>Clenching the Dragon Painting Spear, he desperately tried to close the distance!</p><p>Yet, just when he was a hundred paces away, close enough to reach with a single step, he saw that on the long body of the dark purple python, at every segment, there appeared the figure of the Berserk Giant!</p><p>Some were slicing downward, some stepping upward, some hanging upside down to stab, others flipping to slash…</p><p>From start to finish, they sprinted by in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The Berserk Giant hadn’t disappeared; it had, in an instant, accelerated to an extreme speed!</p><p>Wielding its two swords, it cut through the poison mist, over and over, slicing and severing the python!</p><p>Chi Chi Chi Chi Chi Chi…</p><p>A series of closely linked, massive cleaving sounds emerged instantly, accompanied by a dozen segments of blood mist spraying from the snake’s body, painting a violently intense scene.</p><p>When the serpent madam recovered her senses, she found her massive body had been cut into thirty-six pieces, with excruciating pain instantly spreading through her brain.</p><p>“Sss-ah-ah!”</p><p>A ghastly, wrenching scream echoed between heaven and earth.</p><p>There could be no greater agony than to watch oneself be powerless and segmented before one’s very eyes.</p><p>Those who heard the shriek felt sorrow, those who saw the scene felt terror, and the Twelve Holy Lords’ hair stood on end in fear.</p><p>“How is this possible?!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, already matching Taizai Ci’s pace, had almost reached the speed of a Holy Emperor with various powers enhancing him.</p><p>How could he suddenly explode into a speed hundreds or thousands of times greater?</p><p>Not to mention a hundredfold!</p><p>At their level, even doubling one’s speed was as difficult as scaling the heavens.</p><p>Yet, under such speed from the Berserk Giant, Taizai Ci could only watch, helpless and unable to turn the tide.</p><p>That was his serpent wife!</p><p>Cut into over thirty pieces right before his eyes?</p><p>“I’m scared to death!”</p><p>“What kind of spiritual technique is this?”</p><p>It wasn’t just the Holy Divine Palace that was frightened by such explosive speed; the Saint Servant, the Third Saint, and Palace Master Bai Zhou all felt a chill rise from their feet.</p><p>“Moment of Enlightenment…”</p><p>Bai Zhou racked his brains, barely recalling the information about Xu Xiaoshou, who had used a similar speed-boosting spiritual technique when fighting the Holy Emperor Qilin and transforming into the Ultimate Giant.</p><p>The speed boost of the Ultimate Giant could be amplified, but by how much was impossible to see since its threshold and limit were both marked “unknown.”</p><p>Moreover, the information transmitted through the jade scroll had all been processed secondhand.</p><p>Without having witnessed it personally, no matter how fancifully the intelligence analysts described it, it was of no use.</p><p>As for visual records…</p><p>Back during the battle with the Holy Emperor, there were those daring enough to witness from afar and try to keep the imagery of the Emperor-level battle from the continent’s power of oblivion through special means.</p><p>Unless the intelligence analyst was a Holy Emperor or had treasures at the Holy Emperor’s level, such an idea was mere folly.</p><p>“Frightening indeed…”</p><p>Not just Bai Zhou, but Elder Sang, the Water Ghost, and others were also filled with dread.</p><p>Had it not been for the four words “Moment of Enlightenment,” they wouldn’t even have recalled that Xu Xiaoshou had once fought against the Holy Emperor Qilin.</p><p>Now thinking back…</p><p>From the very beginning, the serpent madam could not defeat Xu Xiaoshou with Locust Poison, and the outcome was already decided.</p><p>Taizai did not choose full force from the start, instead opting for a mutual warm-up with Xu Xiaoshou, was doomed to the same fate.</p><p>“He can’t be blocked!”</p><p>Elder Sang’s eyes shone with a firm conviction.</p><p>This disciple had become far stronger than he could have imagined, and although not entirely due to his own teaching, which was somewhat regrettable… ah, it didn’t matter, Taizai would definitely be unable to stop his advance!</p><p>“Only the Ten High Nobles can fight…”</p><p>“And it will have to be a few of them going all out to have a chance to take down the current Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>“I thought I’d have to wait for Bazhun’an, but it seems I might indeed leave prison this time…”</p><p>…</p><p>All it took was a single chaotic slash of Sword Energy, just one abrupt variation, and the morale of the Holy Divine Palace completely disintegrated.</p><p>The Berserk Giant, as Xu Xiaoshou’s transformed self, sheathed his swords, and the serpent’s blood rained down from the sky, drenching it in ubiquitous crimson.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
