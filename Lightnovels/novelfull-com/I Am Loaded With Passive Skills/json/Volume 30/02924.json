That was the last image my spiritual senses perceived, Lord Li.”</p><p>“Then, I came out!”</p><p>Outside the Crystal Palace, a middle-aged man in black clothes was clutching his neck with a lingering sense of dread, standing in the newly established information department “Mu Zili” of the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>Death is a terrifying experience.</p><p>Even if one does not actually die in the Ran Ming ruins.</p><p>But a beheading still left a deep scar on this information worker, who was not adept at combat.</p><p>Li Fugui had left the Crystal Palace earlier and was now looking gravely at the man in front of him, asking:</p><p>“So, you were the last person to come out of the ruins?”</p><p>“After you, no one from our team has come out for a full fifteen minutes?”</p><p>The First Pavilion in the Sky was still in its early days, but Li Fugui had a lot of people at his disposal, thanks to his previous role as one of the ‘Eighteen Orders of Flowers’.”</p><p>To investigate the rules of the Ran Ming ruins, he had established a rule early on:</p><p>“A person switches every hundred breaths.”</p><p>That is, after the first group of informants entered the Ran Ming ruins for exploration, regardless of whether anything significant happened inside, one person would enter and one person would return every hundred breaths.</p><p>This ensured the timeliness, effectiveness, and accuracy of the information, and also ensured that this final ‘life channel’ could be used.</p><p>The unexpected happened fifteen minutes ago!</p><p>Persons still could shout “Ran Ming” to enter, but no one came out anymore.</p><p>Initially, everyone thought there was an urgent situation in the ruins that required the informants to collate a large amount of information to bring out, hence the mix-up in timing.</p><p>Only after three hundred breaths with no one returning did someone realize something was wrong, and they immediately contacted Lord Li.</p><p>After Li Fugui came and understood the situation, he summoned this last returnee, asked in detail about everything he experienced before leaving the ruins, and subsequently made the following conclusion…</p><p>“Yes, Lord Li, everything is normal!”</p><p>The middle-aged man, pale-faced and swallowing nervously, then said:</p><p>“At least inside the ruins, there were no abnormalities.”</p><p>“If I have to point something out, Lord Shou arrived and had a major fight with Yue Gongli in the Dark Forest…”</p><p>Pausing and looking at the solemn faces around him, he hesitantly asked, “Could it be because ‘Lord Shou came’?”</p><p>In everyone’s minds, Lord Shou represents variability, anomalies; his arrival marks the beginning of strange events.</p><p>He entered the ruins, and suddenly the rules changed, preventing people from leaving… quite normal, even no need to ask why!</p><p>If it had been in the past, people would have scoffed at this.</p><p>However, everyone in the ‘Mu Zili’ information department was personally trained by Lord Li, who had been handling intelligence related to Lord Shou for a very long time—ever since the term ‘Lord Shou’ came into use.</p><p>All one can say is that everyone’s psychological perception has shifted over time, from ‘shocked and amazed’ to ‘utterly numb.’</p><p>Li Fugui shook his head upon hearing this: “Absolutely not possible!”</p><p>If Lord Shou had entered the ruins and the ruins were waiting for him to change the rules, why would it wait until he started fighting Yue Gongli before changing?</p><p>If it wasn’t at the beginning, then it isn’t the case later either.</p><p>Lord Shou could only be a factor, a key, but not the crux of the problem. The key lies in…</p><p>As Li Fugui’s mind raced, processing the disjointed pieces of information, he said deeply:</p><p>“The Dark Forest!”</p><p>The surrounding black-clad intelligence workers looked at him with surprise, “What’s suspicious about that?”</p><p>Li Fugui pointed at the last returnee and said, “According to A-Liu’s timeline, he came out just after Lord Shou and Yue Gongli had entered the Dark Forest not long before, and at that time…”</p><p>“At that time, Lord Li, you had been called away by Lord Shou quite some time ago.” someone pondered.</p><p>Exactly!</p><p>Li Fugui nodded firmly.</p><p>At that point, Lord Shou was not far from discussing the ‘Di Ying Holy Plant’ and ‘Dao Infant’ with me.</p><p>And the arrival of the Dragon Apricot Spirit, after explaining a bunch of things, left with such an odd remark:</p><p>“The Di Ying Holy Plant is changing, do not approach, then all will be well.”</p><p>It’s not hard to see that maybe it came solely to urge that single statement.</p><p>As the World Tree, would Dragon Apricot not know how powerful its Master of the World, Lord Shou, is? Just an Ancestral Tree after all, which could be relocated to the Apricot Realm, so why then is it unapproachable?</p><p>As an Ancestral Tree, why would Dragon Apricot feel such apprehension toward another Ancestral Tree like the Di Ying Holy Plant? After ominously revealing that sentence as if breaking the Way of the Heavens’ energy movement, it got frightened, hid away, and disappeared, not even allowing Lord Shou to ask another question.</p><p>What is it afraid of?</p><p>Ancestral Trees facing each other, even if one is a salted fish and the other disappeared long ago, what is there to fear?</p><p>This is like the Divine among the Ten High Nobles suddenly feeling significantly apprehensive one day about Kui Leihan who appeared in Changde Town and whose combat strength is unclear, merely because he is only at the level of the Spiritual Cultivation Void—Why such extremity?</p><p>“Unless Kui Leihan has broken the shackles of the Ten High Nobles, or has reached that threshold before the Divine, possibly even stepping halfway through it!” Li Fugui’s expression turned exceedingly grim.</p><p>“Lord Li?”</p><p>The people around him voiced their confusion.</p><p>Aren’t we discussing the Ran Ming ruins? How did it shift to Kui Leihan and the Divine?</p><p>Li Fugui did not respond, his thoughts still adrift, even pondering more deeply…</p><p>“Once the God Executioner’s Ruins appeared, they forcibly pulled in all the demi-saints involved, only Hallmaster Dao had made preparations in advance and thus escaped this calamity… but even Ai Cangsheng among the Ten High Nobles did not avoid it!”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
