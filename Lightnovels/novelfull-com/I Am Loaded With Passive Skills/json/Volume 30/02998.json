How could anyone with merely lower Spiritual Cultivation and not at the Demi-Saint Realm dare entertain disdainful delusions about him?</p><p>Is The Divine weak just because he’s at the Spiritual Cultivation Void level?</p><p>Has Kui Leihan, who has not yet been sealed as a demi-saint, been weak?</p><p>Has Bazhun’an, whose cultivation level has fallen again and again, been weak?</p><p>Casual ridicule had gradually become habitual, and neither the Twelve Holy Lords nor old saints like Shadow Saint and Taizai Ci wished to face the overpowering combat power once held by the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>Even if the former Ten High Nobles of Sky City, in the Invitation to Saint had included intelligence describing Xu Xiaoshou as “having the stature of the Ten High Nobles,” everyone dismissed it.</p><p>Now…</p><p>Memories returned!</p><p>An extremely strong reflexes moment, instant deification on the spot!</p><p>The Ten High Nobles were still the Ten High Nobles, Lord Shou truly was the lord, he just needed one look; demi-saints wouldn’t run, there might even be a direct Saint Fall!</p><p>“Heh.”</p><p>“Twelve Holy Lords?”</p><p>“Cowards!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, seeing the twelve demi-saints in a frantic escape, shook his head speechlessly but did not pursue.</p><p>After all, they were not his real opponents, and it was best if they could escape.</p><p>He didn’t start another fight and suddenly face another Mrs. Serpent, weakening his own state in every way possible, which would then tilt the scales of victory toward the opponent.</p><p>With markers like Water Ghost and Elder Sang, unless Divine Relics suddenly closed, not one of the Twelve Holy Lords could escape!</p><p>He looked back at Taizai Ci, not in a hurry to attack.</p><p>Today, the Ultimate Giant couldn’t completely drain him.</p><p>But the earlier display of intense power during the moment of Enlightenment pushed Xu Xiaoshou to use twelve times his strength, nearly depleting his spiritual source.</p><p>His cutting path of Spiritual Cultivation indeed lagged somewhat.</p><p>Luckily, the Dragon Pearl contained a large reserve of power accumulated over time, High Spirits, and transformation were always in operation, coupled with the Human Realm Dao and Engulfing Power as backup…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s endurance was full, not fearing another battle.</p><p>No matter how strong Taizai Ci or how high his defense, so what?</p><p>Once he could initiate another moment of Enlightenment, he’d place all bets for victory firmly on his side.</p><p>For now, the Berserk Giant merely calmly wiped the snake blood off his body. Seeing Elder Sang and others too frightened to utter sarcastic remarks, he mockingly pressured:</p><p>“Taizai Ci, I am so powerful that with just one glance, the Twelve Holy Lords retreat three measures…”</p><p>Ah, such words really should be spoken by others; Li Fugui, how great would it be if you were here? You understand my thoughts best… Xu Xiaoshou quickly reined in his turbulent spirit, raised his chin arrogantly, and said:</p><p>“You, why do you not retreat?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
