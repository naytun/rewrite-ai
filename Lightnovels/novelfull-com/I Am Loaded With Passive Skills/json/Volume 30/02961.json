Forsakes Everything in Pursuit</p><p>“Ouch~”</p><p>“My Brother Ao, Ao won’t come out~”</p><p>Seeing even the usually composed Yue Gongli struggle to contain his emotions, Xu Xiaoshou realized that this guy had encountered a real tough nut to crack.</p><p>He was indeed learning about the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar for the first time.</p><p>Previously, Li Fugui had not mentioned anything about it.</p><p>Including now, after emerging from the embryonic form of the divine palace, having handed over the thinking part to Elder Sang and Water Ghost, Xu Xiaoshou immediately tried to contact his second true body…</p><p>Failure!</p><p>“So, it’s not because the embryonic form of the Di Ying Holy Plant appeared, cutting off the connection between the Divine Relics and the Shengshen Continent.”</p><p>“But because I and the Moon Fox discovered her, she couldn’t resist the temptation and decided to take action, that the contact with the Divine Relics and the outside world was severed.”</p><p>From this, it could be seen that the impact of the Di Ying Holy Plant on the Divine Relics might be even greater than anyone had anticipated.</p><p>If even the only passageway could be closed, then the channels rising from the First Heaven Feather Ascension to the Eighteens Heaven within, could naturally also be slightly affected.</p><p>Under such circumstances, it was not surprising that an accident occurred with the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar.</p><p>Just…</p><p>“Even a demi-saint has been shattered?”</p><p>This was the only thing beyond Xu Xiaoshou’s expectations.</p><p>A demi-saint wasn’t a common cabbage, one couldn’t just bump up with Elixirs, there were too many, far too many trials of the Great Path to endure.</p><p>Even here, in the Divine Relics, where previously within the embryonic divine palace, the Di Ying Holy Plant destroyed Saints like killing ants, it still couldn’t diminish the value of a demi-saint.</p><p>The only explanation was…</p><p>“The level of trickery of the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar is almost the same as that of the Dark Forest?” Water Ghost hesitated and speculated.</p><p>As if thinking of a “trickery” of similar strength, it seemed unlikely that there would be a second one, he quickly shifted his thoughts and said,</p><p>“Or is it, the same one?”</p><p>Elder Sang, who had never entered the underworld, had a pretty good guess after communicating with Cen Qiaofu and turned his gaze along.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also looked towards the distant battlefield of The Divine, murmuring:</p><p>“Di Ying Holy Plant!”</p><p>…</p><p>Sizzle!!!</p><p>Bizarre screams rose from afar, echoing with the sounds from the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar.</p><p>The two overlapped, clearly both being the frantic screeches of the Ancestral Trees of the Di Ying Holy Plant.</p><p>Two Ancestral Trees?</p><p>No… in front of the bluestone pillar, Yue Gongli suddenly realized something and shouted loudly:</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>He couldn’t care less about the people around him and barely managed to shock everyone away with his meager power before leaving life and death to fate.</p><p>Swish, Yue Gongli flashed to Huang Quan’s side and spoke in a low voice:</p><p>“The Holy Emperor’s Body!”</p><p>Huang Quan stood there as if he was both present and absent from the scene.</p><p>In the spatial mirror, his presence had not been revealed before.</p><p>Only now, when Yue Gongli flashed beside him, did it seem he had some connection with him.</p><p>Yama Chief, wearing his Gold Robe and golden mask, only then began to materialize slightly, the sword and saber he carried on his back strating to emit the powerful presence of the nine supreme divine weapons.</p><p>“Stay calm.”</p><p>It was unknown when, under what conditions, and in what manner Huang Quan had formed an alliance with Yue Gongli, but now he was much clearer-headed than Yue Gongli.</p><p>After all, he did not covet the power of the Ancestral God Fate Chart.</p><p>He wasn’t the chess piece being used.</p><p>If possible, the Saint Servant would not be too eager to provoke him, but would be more likely to enjoy undermining his alliance with the Holy Emperor of the Yue Clan.</p><p>Therefore, only Yue Gongli, the party involved, was lost in confusion.</p><p>Huang Quan, remaining detached, was able to clearly understand the current situation, speaking slowly:</p><p>“Regardless of the current state of the Di Ying Holy Plant, it’s not important.”</p><p>“Whether the summoner of the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar is you or them is also not important.”</p><p>“Do not forget, there is only one enemy of the Ancestral Trees right now.”</p><p>Yue Gongli, upon hearing this, his expression stabilized slightly, and then he cracked a smile.</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>It was indeed himself who had disrupted the formation, almost forgetting such an important thing—only The Divine has been attacking the Di Ying Holy Plant from the beginning!</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>As expected, the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar infused with semi-saint position emitted a massive surge of the power of the evil god.</p><p>But rather than raging against those who had already retreated from the vicinity, this power was fully injected into the body of the semi-saint Cheng Guanglu.</p><p>“Heh…”</p><p>The wounds on Cheng Guanglu healed swiftly, and even his skull reformed.</p><p>Having had his semi-saint position usurped and his head blasted open like a watermelon, Cheng Guanglu had still been hanging on to life.</p><p>After all, as long as the spirit doesn’t die, the intention doesn’t die, it is very hard for a demi-saint to fall.</p><p>Moreover, the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar itself wasn’t as fierce as the attack of the Ancestor Tree Branch from the embryonic divine palace before, which erased everything along with the soul and the will on the spot.</p><p>But now!</p><p>That last breath of demi-saint was seemingly all wiped out by the tremendous power of the ancestral source!</p><p>“Hehehe…”</p><p>Cheng Guanglu, having received the power overflowing from the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar, raised his head while wailing tragically.</p><p>At this moment, his eyes only radiated an unnatural and evil energy!</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, keenly aware that the old demi-saint in front of him was no longer the same as earlier, seemed to be possessed by something…</p><p>But it was slightly different.</p><p>“Possession.” Water Ghost’s eyelids drooped, his expression grave.</p><p>Possession?</p><p>After so many encounters with “possession” by ghost beasts, was this time finally not “possession” but “Possession”?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t sure if his understanding of “Possession” was different from that on the Shengshen Continent, and was about to ask.</p><p>Elder Sang had already spoken: “Demi-Saint Cheng Guanglu is now a puppet, dominated by a strand of the will of the Di Ying Holy Plant.”</p><p>So it was that kind of Possession?</p><p>No, not exactly, the Ancestor Tree of the Di Ying Holy Plant merely divided a wisp of will and seized all of Cheng Guanglu’s being?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
