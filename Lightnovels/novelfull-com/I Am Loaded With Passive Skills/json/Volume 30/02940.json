Mister_2</h1><p>Chapter 2940: Chapter 1542: The Two-Faced Anxious Weirdo, ‘Who Am I?’ Mister_2</p><p>The Six Marrow Corpse King, devoid of facial features save for a face made of the Heart of Marrow Absorption, bowed down and lingered over each human for a moment, emitting a simple-minded sound:</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>The coffin suddenly became lively.</p><p>“Come on, Xu Xiaoshou, what are you doing shrunken in the corner?”</p><p>“I opened the coffin, okay! Oh, I should open the door too? Charging through it is also up to me? While you just hang behind my ass waiting to lick my package? Nice one, Moon Fox! What a clever plan!”</p><p>“What’s all this about planning and plotting? So you’re such a petty person, Xu Xiaoshou, alright, you want to keep score, do you? Wasn’t it me who took out the Void Giant Master? I’ve already done my part; what are you doing, reaping the benefits? Wow, Xu Xiaoshou, you just want to watch me die fighting the Di Ying Holy Plant so you can pick up the pieces, huh?”</p><p>“Ha ha ha! What is this, judging others by one’s own narrow mind? Moon Fox, if you’re going to count it like that, then the one who just killed the Void Giant Master was powered by the Heavenly Ancestor, wasn’t it? Should all the blame fall on your child? Without your contribution of ancestral source power, wouldn’t the Di Ying Holy Plant keep getting worse?”</p><p>“Sure, you’re right about that, but leaving that aside, you think you did nothing wrong? If you hadn’t thrown me, would my child have fallen to the ground?”</p><p>“What? I threw you? Wasn’t it you who set me up first?”</p><p>“How did I set you up? Be clear about it, Xu Xiaoshou. I followed you into the Dark Forest…”</p><p>“Oh, you want to kill me, and you think you’re justified? Digging up old grievances, are we? After all, if it wasn’t for you giving birth by cesarean section in broad daylight in the Life Forest, would all these accidents have happened?!”</p><p>With that remark, the Yin Coffin went completely silent.</p><p>The Six Marrow Corpse King hung its head, emitting a delightfully inappropriate sound of someone enjoying a spectacle:</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Yue Gongli’s eyelids twitched and the corners of his mouth spasmed; his entire face seemed to twitch as if revived like a Yin Corpse, and he let out a low and dangerous voice:</p><p>“You saw it all?”</p><p>Was Xu Xiaoshou scared of him? He stood with hands on hips and laughed heartily:</p><p>“Am I blind?”</p><p>“Am I useless?”</p><p>“Do you think my Spatial Upanishad is just for show, that I can’t see anything I want to?”</p><p>He stretched out his hand, “Transformation” turned into a long ice saber, and he lay down on his side, lifted a leg high while half-coiled, and then used the blade of the ice saber to gesture at his stomach, his expression quickly distorting:</p><p>“Aaahhhhhhhhh——”</p><p>He started screaming!</p><p>The cries were so rich in intonation!</p><p>With every change of pitch, Yue Gongli’s face involuntarily twitched.</p><p>The guy didn’t stop there but also made comments:</p><p>“Morals decline as the world turns, beneath the bright sky!”</p><p>“On top of the Yin Coffin, a cesarean birth!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had indeed taken ironic and quirky to the extreme.</p><p>He twisted himself, kicking the air while the ice saber ground back and forth on his stomach, vividly demonstrating!</p><p>“Errr ahhhh…”</p><p>He kept on screaming!</p><p>As the screams reached their peak, Yue Gongli’s face cramped from being stretched too tight, looking like a demon, his clenched hands trembling, and his whole body shaking.</p><p>Meanwhile, Xu Xiaoshou was still in full output mode!</p><p>“Are you cold?”</p><p>“With your chest bared and breasts exposed, such big pectoral muscles, do you need me to throw on a piece of clothing for you?”</p><p>“Don’t worry, covering your face won’t do any good! Once I get back to the Shengshen Continent, the first thing I’ll do is send a portrait of Moon Fox giving birth by cesarean section all over the five regions, so no one will miss your spectacular feat as the successor of the Holy Emperor!”</p><p>One by one, sinful words leaped out from Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth as if they cost him nothing.</p><p>Yue Gongli was like a repressed volcano pushed to the limit, finally unable to hold back and bursting out.</p><p>He lunged at him: “Xu Xiaoshou, I’ll kill you—arghhhh!”</p><p>“Yo, yo, yo, you finally speak your heart, huh? Finally, you don’t have to pretend anymore, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already been on guard, he retracted his leg and spun around, counter-kicking upwards.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Yue Gongli was kicked into debris.</p><p>On the other side, a mirror surfaced, in which there was another fierce-looking Yue Gongli!</p><p>He did not come out but rapidly changed gestures with both hands, frenziedly pinching a spell, all the while murmuring to himself:</p><p>“With the Technique Moon as the curse, the Yin Cut shall bind…”</p><p>“To show the sins, the cursed Yin reveals its true form…”</p><p>Behind him, a blue moon congealed into existence.</p><p>With the power of the evil god as the lead and the powers of the Holy and Heavenly Ancestors as vassals, all three were merged, mad, and bizarre.</p><p>“Great! Come on! So you’re the only mage?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, seeing this, didn’t dare to approach and, with a fierce look, raised both hands.</p><p>Atop his fingers, one source seed after another jumped out, converging at the center of his palms, ready to be condensed further.</p><p>As long as Yue Gongli didn’t use his spiritual technique, he’d keep condensing source seeds.</p><p>He was still condensing them there, and Yue Gongli dared not strike randomly, only able to add more power to the Three Ancestors’ Power.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Outside the Yin Coffin, the branches of the Di Ying Holy Plant finally whipped the Void Giant Master into a mummy, leaving nothing but a crumpled skin to collapse.</p><p>It seemed to be completely satisfied and no longer in a hurry to attack.</p><p>Branches like countless tentacles idly hung on the ground, trembling from time to time, as if digesting after a meal.</p><p>“Boom, boom, boom…”</p><p>Inside the Yin Coffin, waves of destruction surged tumultuously.</p><p>The Six Marrow Corpse King, frightened, shrank into a corner, with both large hands pressed against the walls of the coffin, its big head shaking left and right rapidly, unable to decide who to watch out for.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, we’ve been guided, put down what’s in your hands, and I’ll let go too… Don’t speak of my matters, let bygones be bygones!”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
