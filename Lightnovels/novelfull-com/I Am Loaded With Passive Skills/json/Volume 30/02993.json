Wasn’t this too quick?</p><p>Qin Guan, Kong Tong, and others were all stunned. As their saint’s will swept over, they quickly discerned the key point:</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is unpoisoned?”</p><p>After beheading Madam Serpent with a single sword stroke, he even managed to strike a dashing pose in front of her beheaded and blood-spewing corpse.</p><p>What kind of poisoning was this? It clearly seemed even more intense than if he had taken aphrodisiacs.</p><p>But…</p><p>Something was not right!</p><p>The reason Madam Serpent held such a high status in the eyes of the Twelve Holy Lords was not just because of who she was, but more importantly because of her strength.</p><p>Her poison was so potent that even Taizai Ci himself could be brought down face-to-face, with effects so rapid that one could hardly react and utterly unavoidable.</p><p>If given enough time, it’s conceivable that not even a dozen demi-saints present could stand against her.</p><p>If someone ensured her immortality and continuously increased the potency of her poison, it would even be worth giving a shot against the Holy Emperor himself!</p><p>And now…</p><p>She had her head split by Xu Xiaoshou in just one encounter?</p><p>Despite employing the Locust Poison, which could restrain all demi-saints, Madam Serpent was restrained by Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>What kind of freak was this guy, did he actually possess the Power of Medicine Ancestor?</p><p>“What are you thinking about!”</p><p>Amidst his shocking thoughts, Kong Tong discovered a large blood tumor growing on his back.</p><p>It burst open, transforming into a bloody silhouette that pushed a mask with one hand and wielded the Original Sealing Spear with the other, stabbing fiercely toward the top of his head.</p><p>“Your opponent is me!”</p><p>…</p><p>Rumble rumble rumble!</p><p>All around, the sounds of demi-saints battling fiercely erupted—wind, thunder, fire, water; all manner of trickery was unleashed.</p><p>Surprisingly, in this fight of twelve against four, the Holy Lords very tactfully divided their efforts without a second thought about joining the battle near Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>It seemed that everyone tacitly agreed; matching soldier to soldier, king to king.</p><p>Since Xu Xiaoshou appeared even more enigmatic and troublesome than Madam Serpent, it was only fitting that Taizai Ci would be the one to confront him.</p><p>“Chi chi chi…”</p><p>Blood was flowing heavily before him.</p><p>The demonic aura of the Fourth Sword swept over Madam Serpent’s entire body.</p><p>But strangely, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t see any signs of decreasing vitality on this woman.</p><p>Or perhaps it should be said differently…</p><p>“She died once, but there’s another life left!”</p><p>Viewed from the perspective of the Life Upanishad, the body of Madam Serpent tainted by demons was clearly abandoned.</p><p>After a moment of writhing, her chest burst open, revealing a head coated in thick fluid.</p><p>—Another Madam Serpent!</p><p>“Demi-saint incarnation?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was astonished.</p><p>This was his first time seeing someone summon a demi-saint incarnation within the Divine Relics.</p><p>Only true bodies could enter the Divine Relics; demi-saint incarnations couldn’t even enter, let alone be summoned here unless they were refined on the spot.</p><p>Without a doubt, in theory, this method was feasible, but in practice, very few demi-saints could achieve it.</p><p>Because, as it was well known, the cost of refining a demi-saint incarnation was too exorbitant.</p><p>First, one had to Dissolve the majority of one’s power, the resources required were unimaginable, and lastly…</p><p>Time, was the critical factor!</p><p>Typically, refining a demi-saint incarnation would take decades at most and at least three to five years at the least.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had witnessed the fastest method of refining a demi-saint incarnation—Huang Quan had once given birth publicly, using the power of time to accelerate and strongly coalesce a demi-saint incarnation, then barely trading it for her life.</p><p>Therefore, if one could find some treasures within the Divine Relics that accelerated time, producing a demi-saint incarnation in a matter of days was indeed not a problem.</p><p>But such an action would certainly also lead to a rapid drain on one’s own vital energy, making both the original self and the demi-saint incarnation less than their best.</p><p>After all, not everyone was equipped with a passive skill.</p><p>Within the Divine Relics, whether this action was good or bad was ultimately a matter of opinion.</p><p>…</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>Madam Serpent spit out her tongue.</p><p>Like shedding its skin, the newly emerged Madam Serpent was completely unaffected by the injuries of the old body, fully liberating herself from the demonic aura.</p><p>However…</p><p>“You’re too slow!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head silently.</p><p>He had been prepared, having spied the new life form within Madam Serpent’s body through the perspective of the Life Upanishad.</p><p>If this woman had reincarnated under the flying head at a distance, she might have had a slim chance to survive.</p><p>Spit yourself out in front of me, and I would let you succeed?</p><p>“Clang—”</p><p>The Fourth Sword was drawn sharply, its tip aiming directly at the vile face smeared with foul-smelling fluid and stabbing forward.</p><p>“Don’t!”</p><p>Madam Serpent’s eyes, which burst through the viscous fluid, conveyed horror, “Xu Xiaoshou, spare me…”</p><p>Of course, Xu Xiaoshou would not spare her.</p><p>The woman seemed to have anticipated this, and at the same time, the head that had been thrown into the sky also let out a wail of the soul:</p><p>“Taizai save me—”</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>The Fourth Sword fiercely stabbed something.</p><p>But it wasn’t Madam Serpent’s head—it had stabbed a mass of shadow extending in the air.</p><p>“Shadow…”</p><p>Upon Perception, Xu Xiaoshou realized that at some undefined moment, a large distance had opened between himself and Madam Serpent, as if someone had pushed both apart from the middle.</p><p>But this was not quite accurate.</p><p>Because if something against his own will happened, like some sort of Guidance, Xu Xiaoshou would have noticed.</p><p>The oddity lay in that “shadow”!</p><p>Indeed, ever since he had entered this heavenly chasm, Xu Xiaoshou had noticed that the ground here was completely shrouded in shadow.</p><p>ำAs if a Raging Giant stood here, its cast shadow enveloping everything.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
