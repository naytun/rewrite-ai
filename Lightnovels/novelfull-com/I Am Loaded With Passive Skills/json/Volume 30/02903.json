Since he was here, might as well drain him dry.</p><p>“This person, Lord Shou, you should pay extra attention,”</p><p>Li Fugui’s attitude towards Yue Gongli was completely different from his attitude towards Nian—it was extremely solemn:</p><p>“First of all, Lord Shou should be aware that the five great aristocratic families of the Holy Emperor have their ‘practitioners’ who roam the five regions, like Senior Rao Yaoyao and Dao Xuanji, who are just such people.”</p><p>“These individuals are also called ‘successors of the Holy Emperor,’ but actually this is only half correct, much like how common people refer to both demi-saints and Holy Emperors as ‘Saints’ when they’re unsure what to call them.”</p><p>“The true successor of the Holy Emperor, within the five great aristocratic families of the Holy Emperor, there is always only one in every generation!”</p><p>“Then Dao Xuanji, Senior Rao Yaoyao…” the second true body asked, sidelong.</p><p>“They are half counted; they’re still within their trial period, not yet confirmed as ‘the only ones,'” said Li Fugui.</p><p>“The only one?”</p><p>“Yes, once ‘the only one’ is confirmed, it means that this person is absolutely loyal, absolutely committed, and absolutely capable of carrying the banner forward. Their ability may not necessarily surpass that of their predecessors, but at the very least they should be able to steady the family business. Then all the resources of the demi-saint family will tilt towards them to facilitate their growth, and the position of Holy Emperor could be given up at any time, as long as the timing is ripe,” Li Fugui declared, shocking as thunder.</p><p>The second true body’s expression grew stern as it pondered something, “Bei, Hua?”</p><p>Li Fugui nodded solemnly:</p><p>“Bei! Hua!”</p><p>So, had Bei Huai and Sword Deity Hua passed the assessment period and been fully recognized by the upper echelons of their respective aristocratic families, becoming the sole inheritors of the position of Holy Emperor?</p><p>Not right!</p><p>The second true body quickly sensed an anomaly: “That Bei person, absolutely loyal?”</p><p>Are you kidding?</p><p>Although not very familiar with Bei Huai, his character seemed like one where he would give up the demi-saint family just for his research.</p><p>Loyal? The sun would have to rise from the west for him to be loyal!</p><p>Li Fugui looked hesitant: “The following intelligence, Fugui cannot guarantee its accuracy, I can only say it is seventy percent likely to be true…”</p><p>“Speak.”</p><p>“Sword Deity Hua undoubtably obtained the position of demi-saint with ability surpassing his predecessor. As for that Bei person…” Li Fugui paused for a moment, “it seems like he couldn’t suppress it and faced backlash.”</p><p>The second true body’s head buzzed.</p><p>What did that mean?</p><p>The previous generation’s Holy Emperor of the Bei family was killed by Bei Huai?</p><p>There was only one position of Holy Emperor, which could only be passed down from generation to generation… That would mean demi-saint Bei Huai slaughtered the previous family head who was the Holy Emperor?</p><p>Feng Zhongzui made a move on Feng Tingchen’s brain, declaring himself king?</p><p>The second true body conjured up a shocking play in its mind, feeling a bit terrified, but when it thought of Bei Huai being one of the Ten High Nobles, compared to Sword Deity Hua…</p><p>It’s not that the Seven Sword Deities were weaker than the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>But in Xu Xiaoshou’s understanding, ninety percent of the Ten High Nobles were monsters with something wrong in their heads, and this idea naturally transferred to the second true body as well.</p><p>Sword Deity Hua was completely fine!</p><p>The one deserving of a “?” should indeed be Bei Huai; this person indeed had a serious illness!</p><p>Whether towards Red Coat, Greedy the Cat Spirit, his family head, or even towards himself…</p><p>“So, is this the reason why the Bei family of the Holy Emperor was resisted by the other four great houses?” The second true body gained some understanding of the reason Bei Huai could only send out a thought incarnation.</p><p>“Correct.”</p><p>Li Fugui nodded firmly, and he thought of the same thing, “Actually, I still can’t quite understand why he was allowed out; he shouldn’t have been able to come out…”</p><p>I know this one!</p><p>The second true body thought of this and was almost on the verge of tears.</p><p>At the Four Symbols Secret Realm, the first thing Bei Huai did after his arrival was to show him Dao Qiongcang’s request.</p><p>If it weren’t for being in cahoots…</p><p>If it weren’t for inside-outside collusion…</p><p>With the four great aristocratic families of the Holy Emperor standing guard, how could Bei Huai have been allowed out?</p><p>“Damn Hallmaster Dao…”</p><p>The second true body half cursed and then suddenly realized something, chuckling, “So, Hallmaster Dao isn’t loyal, he’s not the only one, is the Holy Emperor Dao Clan trying to cultivate another?”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>Li Fugui smiled.</p><p>The second true body smiled too.</p><p>They cultivated a mess!</p><p>“Yue Bei Hua Rao Dao is actually a power ranking of one of the Holy Emperors’ aristocratic families,” said Li Fugui, “for the Dao Clan to produce a Hallmaster Dao, they have already exhausted their luck, and even slightly harmed themselves attempting to make another of the same ability—no, half as capable would be as difficult as reaching the heavens.”</p><p>The second true body then lowered its head and began counting on its fingers, “So after Senior Rao Yaoyao died, the Holy Emperor Rao, who was still in the assessment period, lost their ‘only one’, and they couldn’t even produce a ‘Dao Xuanji’ in a short time, leading to a gap in succession, and that’s why I could hear the true name of Holy Emperor Wangze?”</p><p>Upon reflecting, it indeed had no recollection of the revered names of the old generation of Holy Emperors from the five great families, except for Wangze—what a Guidance, the power of oblivion!</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Li Fugui nodded with a smile.</p><p>Only Lord Shou could say these things.</p><p>Compared to him, compared to the Ten High Nobles, people like Senior Rao Yaoyao and Dao Xuanji indeed seemed to lack continuity.</p><p>Actually, as prodigies, they were already quite competent and exerting a lot of effort…</p><p>“So, after saying so much, what about Yue Gongli?”</p><p>The second true body raised its head, knowing that Li Fugui was best at comparison— he always managed to outline the general position and level of the unknown by what he currently knew.</p><p>Li Fugui’s expression instantly turned grave, he solemnly declared:</p><p>“Yue Gongli, after Yue Gongnu was discarded, became ‘the only one,’ the true ‘successor of the Holy Emperor’.”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
