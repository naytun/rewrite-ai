After finding no abnormalities, he passed it behind him to Reverse.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou extended his hand.</p><p>Elder Sang suddenly retracted it and held the God Fated Star close to his chest, addressing Bai Zhou:</p><p>“Well said.”</p><p>With these two words dismissing the man, he then turned to Reverse, “Eighteen God Fated Stars to summon the Ancestral God Fate Chart.”</p><p>“Right?” Xu Xiaoshou did not catch whether Elder Sang’s words were meant as a question and found himself uncertain.</p><p>“Do you think that now is a suitable time to summon the Ancestral God Fate Chart and claim the legacy?” Elder Sang asked expressionlessly.</p><p>At this, Xu Xiaoshou abruptly came to his senses.</p><p>Previously, while in the nascent form of the Dark Divine Court, Yue Gongli had once speculated:</p><p>The Ancestral God Fate Chart might have fallen into the hands of the Di Ying Holy Plant.</p><p>Whether this was true or not, various signs indicated that the situation of the Di Ying Holy Plant undergoing demonic transformation, desiring Super Taoization, and aspiring toward Godhood was indeed genuine.</p><p>The Ran Ming ruins were likely no longer just Ran Ming’s ruins.</p><p>The Ran Ming legacy had probably also been tampered with by “people.”</p><p>Gathering eighteen God Fated Stars to summon the Ancestral God Fate Chart at this time might…</p><p>Result in something other than the Ancestral God Fate Chart.</p><p>Perhaps something undesirable might occur?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts raced rapidly, now approaching the issue from another angle:</p><p>“But if we don’t take it, shall we let Yue Gongli have it?”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Water Ghost turned his head, clutching the golden beast mask as if pondering something.</p><p>Elder Sang also pressed down on his straw hat, squinting in thought. Surprisingly, his hands were withered, yet his strength did not harm the flimsy straw hat in the slightest.</p><p>“You make some sense…”</p><p>Sense?</p><p>What sense?</p><p>Cen Qiaofu shook his head, snapping out of thoughts about tomorrow’s dinner, “What are you all talking about?”</p><p>Elder Sang, without looking back, said, “A person from Mu Zili found me, saying…”</p><p>“What?” Cen Qiaofu looked over.</p><p>“He said, ‘The God Executioner’s Ruins might not be the God Executioner’s Ruins anymore.’</p><p>This statement made everyone frown, including Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Yet, his focus differed from ordinary people— it wasn’t about the content he had already pondered, but rather…</p><p>“A person from Mu Zili?”</p><p>“That’s your person.”</p><p>“My person?”</p><p>“Lord Li.”</p><p>What? Lord Li, who is that?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was baffled upon hearing this and took a moment to remember.</p><p>Indeed, Li Fugui had another self-proclaimed title that seemed to be “Lord Li”?</p><p>“It’s not important now.”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Xu Xiaoshou cleared his cluttered thoughts, looking towards the God Fated Star in Elder Sang’s hand and carefreely said:</p><p>“Even if the outcome is not as expected, so what?”</p><p>“If soldiers come, block them; if water comes, cover it with earth. If I were afraid of this Divine Relic, afraid of that Evil Tree causing trouble, or even afraid of the God Slayer Ran Ming himself, I would never have entered these ruins.”</p><p>With that, he extended his hand, signaling Elder Sang to pass over the final piece of the puzzle.</p><p>Whether putting together eighteen God Fated Stars would automatically summon the Ancestral God Fate Chart and end this sealed trial of the God Slayer’s legacy, nobody knew.</p><p>But everyone present, having listened to the discussion among these saintly servants, also sensed the emergence of the Di Ying Holy Plant, its transformation, and the secrets of this Divine Relic were irrevocably linked.</p><p>In such circumstances, Lord Shou still chose such a calm and carefree approach…</p><p>“You’ve changed.”</p><p>Elder Sang looked up slightly, gazing at the young man before him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was indeed still Xu Xiaoshou, but the details in his appearance had changed, his conduct and even his character, were utterly different from the youngster he knew from Eighth Palace.</p><p>Before, he went from blindly ignorant to overly cautious in the face of major events.</p><p>Meticulous in every detail, personally involved in everything.</p><p>One might even say paranoid, always looking back and forth to an extreme.</p><p>Now, he seemed to have regressed from cautious to blindly ignorant, eager to dive headfirst into everything he saw.</p><p>However, Elder Sang knew…</p><p>The mountain is still a mountain, yet it is not that same mountain anymore.</p><p>In just one year, how many hardships had he endured?</p><p>“Everything changes, people are no exception, and I am even more so,” Xu Xiaoshou smiled, looking around.</p><p>The heavens and the earth are changing, so why not me?</p><p>If it were a year ago, or even half a year or a few months ago,</p><p>he could not have imagined that one day he would be able to enter this unique Divine Relic and be qualified to converse with many individuals he once thought he had no right to speak to.</p><p>Elder Sang opened his mouth, wanting to say something else.</p><p>He wanted to say that if putting together eighteen God Fated Stars would automatically summon the Ancestral God Fate Chart… then the summoning task could completely be left to Water Ghost, thus avoiding unknown risks.</p><p>He wanted to say that the Ancestral God Fate Chart might not necessarily be the best choice, after all, the God Slayer Ran Ming was still one of the Ten Ancestors, a skinny camel larger than a horse. It might not be outperformed by Di Ying Holy Plant… Therefore, when they first entered the Divine Relic, its statement claiming that the three legacies left behind might still be effective could be true. If by taking two they lost one, it would indeed be a loss.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
