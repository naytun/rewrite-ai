If the Moon Fox’s path is viable and the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar gets functional again, you all can use these stars I’m leaving to summon the column and ‘climb’ to the Eighteen Heavens yourselves.”</p><p>“What about you?” the Water Ghost glanced over with inquiring eyes.</p><p>“Like I said, I’m going to cultivate a bit,” Xu Xiaoshou handed over the God Fated Star and sat down cross-legged on the spot.</p><p>This move was incredibly provocative!</p><p>In the distance, next to the dimmed Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar, the people of the Holy Divine Palace nearly exploded in anger!</p><p>“What is he doing?”</p><p>“He’s not only treating us as expendable scouts, but also belittling us, and now he’s sitting down too?”</p><p>“Is he trying to imitate that guy who just ascended? Trying to transcend on the spot? I don’t buy it!”</p><p>“Lord Yue, give him a Feather Ascension too, to deal with this brat. He’s too arrogant!”</p><p>“Yes, Ruler!”</p><p>After hearing this, Yue Gongli, with drooping eyelids, scanned the people behind him and was at a loss for words.</p><p>I wish I could…</p><p>But I can’t do it!</p><p>Holding the ancient bamboo slip still with legible inscriptions, Yue Gongli was certain; after communicating with Brother Anxiety, Xu Xiaoshou definitely remembered everything from before.</p><p>Nowadays, no one could question the talent of this Saint Servant Lord Shou—not even the Ten High Nobles had the right.</p><p>Perhaps, Xu Xiaoshou was the next Kui Leihan?</p><p>Could he just sit cross-legged on the spot, and upon opening his eyes, transcend the Great Path?</p><p>Yue Gongli even began to consider, if Xu Xiaoshou really succeeded…</p><p>“Lord Yue, we really must stop Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Some subordinates did indeed have brains.</p><p>Yet speaking this out loud just revealed that though they may be smart, there was more naivety. With annoyance, Yue Gongli replied, “And you’ll stop him?”</p><p>“You do it!”</p><p>“With what shall I stop him? With my burning passion and ironclad will?”</p><p>“…But surely we can’t just watch Xu Xiaoshou succeed, can we?”</p><p>Just sitting around waiting was definitely not an option.</p><p>Yue Gongli’s brow furrowed in deep thought, soon conjuring an idea in his mind.</p><p>If he wanted to play it safe, he could take his men, disperse the God Fated Stars he had, and vanish into thin air.</p><p>Once Xu Xiaoshou succeeded, whether in ascending or becoming a Saint Servant, the impatient would inevitably summon the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar on their own.</p><p>The First Heavens would then be Yue Gongli’s to rule.</p><p>But that would be too cowardly, akin to raising the white flag of surrender.</p><p>Moreover, merely the name “Holy Divine Palace” wouldn’t allow for such a disheartened “countermeasure” against the still rampant Saint Servant.</p><p>But on the flip side…</p><p>If he wanted to advance, his only option was the “aggressive” approach!</p><p>To reactivate the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar before Xu Xiaoshou could succeed without fearing failure, even if it meant testing repeatedly, and to be the first to reach the Eighteen Heavens. There, in the search for the God Fated Star, they might still have a chance at triumph.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
