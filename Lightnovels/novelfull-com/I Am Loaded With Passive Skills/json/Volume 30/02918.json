Lord Shou, you can take it as a little story and listen for what it’s worth; it has no effect on the current situation.”</p><p>Saying this, Li Fugui seemed to get excited, leaning forward slightly with great interest:</p><p>“Lord Shou, don’t you find it curious that ‘Dao Infant,’ this perfect embryo, if fixed into a certain form, bears a resemblance to some things in the current world of spiritual cultivation?”</p><p>Resemblance?</p><p>Pondering, the second true body suddenly had a flash of spiritual light, and with a mix of surprise and doubt, said, “You mean…”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Li Fugui nodded vigorously: “Demi-saint person!”</p><p>Hiss…</p><p>The second true body took in a sharp breath.</p><p>This, this is rather thought-provoking and terrifying, isn’t it?</p><p>“But it is impossible to verify; it’s just a guess that seems somewhat logical upon a cursory thought but is actually full of holes and does not really hold up to logic,” Li Fugui concluded, shaking his head, apparently finding his own speculation far-fetched.</p><p>Yet the second true body felt as if she had grasped something.</p><p>It must be said that, while Li Fugui appears ordinary, he is vastly learned and always able to provoke new thoughts through his conversation.</p><p>All of a sudden, it seemed the second true body understood why most among the Ten High Nobles haven’t undergone sanctification.</p><p>Even the advice Bazhun’an had once asked Li Fugui to convey to her true body:</p><p>“Do not seek sanctification with a demi-saint person, not even for the sanctification of the Way of the Sword.”</p><p>She didn’t quite understand at the time, but now, after all she had experienced and given it careful thought, she was starting to comprehend.</p><p>As Li Fugui said, a path with a fixed end hardly allows for new developments.</p><p>So…</p><p>Ordinary people see her practicing various Paths and perceive the journey as fraught with difficulties and challenges, achieving fame only for a moment and, looking at it long-term, it seems muddled and not wise.</p><p>Above the Abyss Island, seeing that her Sword Spirit Body is making progress on three Paths simultaneously, Bazhun’an is not worried but rather full of excitement and tremendous encouragement.</p><p>Is this the difference between a genius and the Ten High Nobles?</p><p>One endpoint is the demi-saint or Holy Emperor, which is attainable.</p><p>The other is the Ancestral God, or even beyond the Ancestral God, which is unattainable.</p><p>“I’ve digressed.”</p><p>The second true body quickly regained her composure.</p><p>As fruitful as her conversations with Li Fugui were, she was here to inquire about the disturbances related to the Dark Forest:</p><p>“Will a Dao Infant leaving its body cause a great disturbance?”</p><p>Upon this question, Li Fugui, who seemed to know everything, also hesitated.</p><p>“Lord Shou, this…”</p><p>After hesitating for a moment, he chose to be honest:</p><p>“The information I have about the Ancestral Di Ying Holy Plant is only as much as I’ve told you.”</p><p>“As to what the Dao Infant looks like and what consequences its departure from the body will cause, I do not know.”</p><p>After all, I don’t even know what the Di Ying Holy Plant looks like; everything is just ‘hearsay’… Li Fugui pondered inwardly.</p><p>The second true body was now at a loss.</p><p>She also wanted to know whether the weird changes occurring in the Dark Forest originated with Yue Gongli or with the Di Ying Holy Plant!</p><p>“But if I don’t know, Lord Shou, you can ask Lord Dragon Apricot, who is also an Ancestral Tree,” Li Fugui suggested.</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
