Sword Cuts Off The Snake Woman'S Voice</h1><p>Chapter 2990: Chapter 1557: A Shout Splits 12 Saints, The Sword Cuts Off The Snake Woman’s Voice</p><p>“Coming?”</p><p>The desolate plains were blanketed by yellow sand, and the mournful wind howled.</p><p>After his vision blurred several times, Kong Tong lowered his hand from rubbing his eyes, turned around, and shouted towards the chasm below:</p><p>“They’ve come!”</p><p>A rustle suddenly arose from around the plaque of the Fate Temple.</p><p>The higher void quickly contracted into a small circle, each person with their heart hung high, ready for a fierce battle.</p><p>The Twelve Holy Lords each leapt up onto the cliff’s edge; their emotions paradoxically calm, someone made a move and asked:</p><p>“How many?”</p><p>Kong Tong rubbed his eyes again, peering into the sandstorm, confirmed he had not seen wrong, and yelled downward:</p><p>“Five.”</p><p>Only five?</p><p>The higher void huddled around the plaque instantly felt a relief.</p><p>They had more than ten demi-saints here, were they afraid of their five Saint Servants?</p><p>According to intelligence, there were only two Saints among the Saint Servants right now, Cen Qiaofu and the Water Ghost.</p><p>Just these two, along with Lord Shou, plus two more from the higher void, and they dared come here?</p><p>“Somewhat amusing.”</p><p>Indeed, it was irresistibly funny, “Do they not realize we have fifteen demi-saints here?”</p><p>No sooner had he spoken than laughter failed to rise, and all were as silent as cicadas in cold weather.</p><p>Yes, how could the power of the Saint Servants be unknown?</p><p>Their cards were openly on the table, and they definitely had a way to know the situation here.</p><p>And them daring to attack with just five people, what did that imply?</p><p>It implied that they were not afraid!</p><p>It suggested that they believed, with Lord Shou pulling strings on the left and lifting weights on the right, along with two ornaments, could annihilate the dozen-plus demi-saints here!</p><p>“Arrogant!”</p><p>“Proud!”</p><p>“But the Saint Servants never act recklessly, especially since the Water Ghost must be among them…”</p><p>Thinking this far made their formation self-destruct.</p><p>On a side glance at the plaque where that towering silent figure stood, bracing against the wind as if leaning on a railing, all higher void suddenly felt greatly reassured.</p><p>What was there to fear?</p><p>This was War Saint Taizai Ci!</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou coming here would bite off more than he could chew, and have to leave with his tail between his legs!</p><p>…</p><p>“Who is Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Amidst the howling wind and rising sand, someone anxiously inquired.</p><p>A distance of thousands of miles was merely an instant for demi-saints, and soon those few figures transformed from tiny specks, their outline becoming discernible.</p><p>Peering through the haze, Qin Guan bumped into Kong Tong’s shoulder, frowning, “Why does it seem like there are more than two Saints?”</p><p>Indeed, there were more!</p><p>Kong Tong scrutinized closely.</p><p>Aside from the leading figure, who was somewhat elusive, his four companions all had the cultivation level of demi-saints.</p><p>“The one in the center is Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>As this statement was made, the Twelve Holy Lords turned their gaze.</p><p>They saw the leading black-clad young man, barely in his twenties, handsomely chiseled and remarkably distinguished, striding along with the majesty of a dragon and tiger, his presence that of the God of War’s descent, even as a mortal, the pressure he brought was no less than Lord Taizai Ci himself!</p><p>“What sort of force is this?”</p><p>All the Twelve Holy Lords felt a chill, their attention captured by the shadow under Xu Xiaoshou’s feet.</p><p>They observed that his shadow was normal—neither too large nor too dark—apparently lacking any external manifestation of the God of War’s power.</p><p>“Look behind him!”</p><p>Qin Guan’s pupils suddenly shook, pointing to something in the distance.</p><p>Amidst the whirlwind and storm, while Xu Xiaoshou indeed looked small, an outline of a colossal figure started to faintly emerge from the dust behind him.</p><p>“Thud!”</p><p>One step…</p><p>“Thud!”</p><p>Another step…</p><p>“Thud!”</p><p>As the Twelve Holy Lords watched this imagery unfold, they felt as though they were caught in an illusion, transported to another world, where all but the sandstorm ceased to exist.</p><p>That half-visible sand giant stepped forward one step after another, unhurriedly yet each step seeming to crush the hearts of those below, as if trampling their wills to dust.</p><p>“Such a force!”</p><p>Such a display of pressure, distinctly an effect demi-saints had on ordinary Spiritual Cultivators, yet now it was reversed.</p><p>Who was Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>And what caliber were the Twelve Holy Lords?</p><p>Wasn’t this an inversion of natural order, a defiance against the Heavenly Gang?</p><p>“The forbidden zone ahead, all who approach shall halt!”</p><p>Kong Tong’s body subtly writhed, skillfully shedding that pressure off, squeezed through a gap, pulled out a spear, and roared:</p><p>“I, Tuanling Holy Lord Kong Tong, under the command of War Saint Taizai Ci of the Northern Region of the Holy Divine Palace, declare openly, trespass and be granted death…”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>His declaration was still incomplete.</p><p>The young figure in the forefront casually swung his hand back, and suddenly the air stilled, silence fell all around.</p><p>Kong Tong was as if someone had choked him, the words to bolster his position sticking painfully in his throat.</p><p>“Tap tap tap…”</p><p>Five figures stepped out from the dust.</p><p>By then, the leading young man’s mocking smile on his lips was clearly visible.</p><p>He swept his indifferent gaze over the surrounding Twelve Holy Lords, shook his head slightly, and his eyes looked past them down into the chasm below, disdainfully said:</p><p>“Let’s skip the pleasantries, young master doesn’t have that much time to waste on you insignificant bugs.”</p><p>Ignoring!</p><p>A blatant ignoring!</p><p>This look, this tone, clearly displayed utter disregard for all the demi-saints present.</p><p>The accompanying Water Ghost and Elder Sang’s faces twitched, great, just you are busy, we’re the insignificant bugs with time to peck at each other.</p><p>Around the jagged cliffs of the heavenly chasm, all neatly designed and awaiting their arrival, each of the Twelve Holy Lords now bore clear and towering rage.</p><p>Not just a hint!</p><p>Visible, soaring fury!</p><p>How dare such a reckless, disrespectful, and cheeky group utter such wild words in the presence of the noble Twelve Holy Lords? Watch how I blast you!</p><p>But before they could even open their mouths…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
