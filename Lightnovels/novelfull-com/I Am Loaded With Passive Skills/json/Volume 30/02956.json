Why would we talk about cooperation?</p><p>In an unequal situation, eagerly initiating talks about equal cooperation isn’t about respecting others, it’s about devaluing oneself.</p><p>In the eyes of others, that wouldn’t be seen as respect, but as a fat sheep—ripe for the slaughter!</p><p>With a change in mentality,</p><p>Looking at the once famed Xu Yue Grey Palace Master, Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze also shifted.</p><p>He was about to say something but saw Elder Sang standing in front, hesitated slightly, and chose to close his mouth with a smirk.</p><p>Who is this person?</p><p>He is none other than the infamous Fen Qin!</p><p>Before, I had no choice but to survive in the martial arts world full of deceit and cunning, forced to bargain with those crafty old men.</p><p>Now, I have someone in front of me!</p><p>We may have internal conflicts, but that doesn’t stop us from uniting against a common foe!</p><p>If he can silence everyone’s thoughts and mouths with a single word, why should I bother to step forward?</p><p>Just lie down and enjoy!</p><p>A glance to the side…</p><p>The Water Ghost, leaning to one side, was combing through his wet hair and fiddling with the golden mask, appearing completely detached from the situation.</p><p>Another glance…</p><p>Bored to death, Cen Qiaofu fiddled with his little axe, his eyes unfocused as if his brain had been scooped out, with only one thought circulating: what grand meal should I have after leaving the ruins?</p><p>Too practised!</p><p>They lay down with far more skill than I could ever muster in my own spiralling life!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally understood what had been missing on his hurried journey.</p><p>It was the experience!</p><p>Why should I bother scheming?</p><p>Why must I master every Path, be it battling, strategizing, planning, or cultivating to the highest level?</p><p>I just need to learn how to delegate—leave the brains to Elder Sang and Water Ghost, leave the fighting to Cen Qiaofu and Water Ghost… wouldn’t that make me into Bazhun’an?</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>So this is what it feels like to be Bazhun’an?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou coveted fiercely and looked ahead, his lips sealed, his thoughts completely emptied.</p><p>All around, there was sudden silence.</p><p>“Are you forcing me?”</p><p>Palace Master Bai Zhou’s face didn’t look good.</p><p>After speaking out and waiting for a long time, the Saint Servants didn’t respond, nor did this kid Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He could only look to Elder Sang, waiting for his answer.</p><p>Elder Sang raised his hand to his forehead, paused, then touched the top of his head, saying nothing.</p><p>He just silently stared at the Xu Yue Grey Palace’s Palace Master Bai Zhou, his round eyes and brows seemed to move slightly, or perhaps they didn’t move at all.</p><p>The wind blew through, chilling the legs exposed outside the high-slit skirt.</p><p>Bai Zhou squinted his eyes, feeling that the atmosphere around him suddenly turned dangerous, and closed his legs back together.</p><p>Looking ahead again…</p><p>The Upanishad demi-saint Woodcutter is lost in thought, the Upanishad demi-saint smoothing his face, the sunburnt man still scratching his scalp, and the harmless Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>Aren’t these the four abominators?</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Another explosion sounded in the distance.</p><p>Bai Zhou’s heart skipped a beat. Something was wrong; The Divine wouldn’t make a move without a reason… Five abominators?</p><p>“Clatter.”</p><p>In front, Xu Xiaoshou extracted a straw hat from nowhere and placed it atop the bald head of the monk in front of him, who was shorter than him.</p><p>The scene was now complete.</p><p>The charred Sleeveless Saint Servant finally had something to touch.</p><p>He pressed down on the straw hat, his sinister gaze hidden within the shadows of his dark circles, which in turn tucked into the shade beneath the hat, while his scorched body melded entirely into the darkness.</p><p>The wind carried a hint of murderous intent.</p><p>Bai Zhou finally realized what was wrong – he was alone and unsupported, while the opposition…</p><p>Saint Servant·Complete Form!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
