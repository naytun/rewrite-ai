I might get away with it as a higher void-level, but who am I? I am the Sleeveless Saint Serva—</p><p>Heh, I am nothing, am I, you damned rebellious disciple… Huff, be tolerant, magnanimous… Sang Qiye, hang in there, this isn’t your first time, you can totally do it, this will only be…</p><p>Heh, most likely not the last time either! Elder Sang looked heavenward devoid of spirit, suddenly feeling his nose tingle and was caught between laughter and tears.</p><p>What sins have I committed to accept this rebellious disciple?</p><p>Oh, I have, I have committed many.</p><p>I should!</p><p>…</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>In the distance, Cen Qiaofu, who caught the “save me” look, finally let out a laugh, daring to approach this fearsome mentor-student duo.</p><p>He had no thoughts whatsoever of helping his former chess buddy.</p><p>Provoke Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>He was doing well not to have given in to others.</p><p>Going up to share the heat would not only be hard work with no thanks but also attract trouble for himself.</p><p>“Everyone, come over here!”</p><p>But acting as a peacemaker, Cen Qiaofu felt he was qualified, after all, he was old enough, and he had mastered the skill of playing the elder card.</p><p>He gestured to Water Ghost and Xu Xiaoshou, signaling them over:</p><p>“Whether it’s about being a master or a godfather, it is certainly important! Extremely important!”</p><p>First affirming this point—nothing was bigger than this between men, even if the sky fell, Cen Qiaofu dared to say, “But let’s not forget The Divine is still fighting that Evil Tree, and we don’t have time to stand by and wait.”</p><p>What a cunning old man, you’re on my list.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou found no fault in what was said.</p><p>He was inclined not to let Elder Sang off the hook just yet, but indeed there were priorities to consider.</p><p>Elder Sang wouldn’t show up for no reason, and then self-sabotage. He must have brought something important to have the face to come.</p><p>“Yue Gongli has disappeared.”</p><p>Water Ghost approached, wrinkling his brow, speaking offhand, and aiming to distract in a roundabout way.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled at this.</p><p>Nice one with the powder-purple striped underwear, do you think I don’t know that gut-spilling man ran off?</p><p>Your change of topic is also very clumsy. You too are on my list!</p><p>Anyone willing to help old man Sang today is going into my little black book!</p><p>“That fox is no longer that important, hard to kill and too time-consuming to grind down. Knowing what he’s up to and stopping it is sufficient… come over.”</p><p>“`</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
