His mere presence seemed like a one-man guard that thousands could not breach, exuding unmatched valor.</p><p>“You, are you Taizai Ci?”</p><p>This was the first time Xu Xiaoshou had seen someone whose aura could rival that of The Divine, and this man was even taller!</p><p>Through the Life Upanishad, he could clearly see the immense flow of blood and Qi energy within the other, far surpassing any demi-saint he had ever encountered, comparable to the Kun Peng divine envoy, Elder Yu.</p><p>“Is this what they call talent, the God of War bloodline return to ancestry that others envy but cannot have…”</p><p>“Water Ghost said he could stand against Holy Emperor…”</p><p>At first, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t believe this claim.</p><p>After all, many wielded the power of the ancestral source, but apart from Yue Bei Hua Rao Dao, there were few among “humans” who could even approach the capabilities of a Holy Emperor.</p><p>It seemed that this Mr. Taizai really had some tricks up his sleeve.</p><p>And as the Guardian “watchdog” of the Holy Divine Palace in the Northern Region, he was certainly not like some old salty fish that only knew how to idle about.</p><p>The rugged face of Taizai Ci was partially concealed within his half-exposed iron helmet, and after making his appearance, he planted the Dragon Painting Spear into the earth without striking. Instead, he declared:</p><p>“My lord only gave me orders to wait for you all; I was not ordered to execute you. Therefore, you now have a choice…”</p><p>Ignoring all outsiders, he cast his crimson gaze from beneath the dark iron helmet toward Xu Xiaoshou, who could make decisions, and said in a deep voice:</p><p>“To retreat or wait, both are fine.”</p><p>“Move forward, and you die.”</p><p>These words instantly separated the tense battle between the Twelve Holy Lords and Sangshui Cenbai, as everyone’s gaze converged on Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>The situation became clear—until the war of the big shots was over, no matter who won on their side, it would be pointless. It was better to stop fighting altogether.</p><p>How very domineering… Xu Xiaoshou heard not a hint of arrogance in Taizai Ci’s words, only immense confidence in his own strength.</p><p>But wasn’t this also a form of contempt from someone long accustomed to a high position?</p><p>If this were the past, Xu Xiaoshou would never have considered picking a fight with someone from the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>Especially since Taizai Ci was not exactly what one would call a person of the Holy Divine Palace in the typical sense. He seemed to realize that Xu Xiaoshou was not weak and didn’t want to start a major conflict with a Saint Servant.</p><p>But…</p><p>Times have changed, haven’t they, my Lord Taizai Ci.</p><p>Today’s Xu Xiaoshou was far from intimidated by these warnings, and upon hearing them, he almost felt like laughing.</p><p>“If I say that today I definitely want to have a taste of snake soup?” Xu Xiaoshou pointed distantly at the giant python that swallowed the sky.</p><p>Taizai Ci was unmoved, the massive shadow of the God of War still covering even space itself, his voice as firm as iron:</p><p>“No one can touch those whom I am here to protect.”</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>The dark purple python behind him moved excitedly, emitting a sound of pleasure and pride, its gaze toward the battlefield full of provocation.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled with a nod:</p><p>“But whomever this young master decides to kill, no one can keep them safe.”</p><p>“How should we resolve this?”</p><p>He lifted his head and spread his hands in a gesture of helplessness:</p><p>“It seems that between you and me, someone must end up embarrassed today.”</p><p>“How about this; if you win, you can spread my embarrassment across the five regions, and if I win, you agree to one condition from me.”</p><p>The shadow on the ground began to wriggle.</p><p>The dark purple python’s eyes also shone brightly.</p><p>The Twelve Holy Lords around were all suddenly showing signs of panic.</p><p>“Lord Taizai Ci, the first warning from the communication bead is not to engage in conversation with Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Before the words could be finished, Xu Xiaoshou disappeared from his spot with a swish.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The ground exploded with a loud noise.</p><p>At the same moment, Taizai Ci realized the sneak attack and followed in pursuit.</p><p>Before the eyes of the transformed Snake Lady python sprang two diminutive figures, both radiating world-shaking power.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou launched a punch that thundered through the air.</p><p>“`</p><p>Taizai Ci’s Dragon Painting Spear swept across horizontally.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Space shattered like a mirror, the Order of the Great Path snapped like a whip, and the terrifying ripple from the clash of the power of the ancestral source pierced straight through the giant serpent’s eyeball.</p><p>“Hiss-ss-ss—”</p><p>In agony, the giant serpent writhed, lashing the void, all the while swiftly retreating.</p><p>“Taizai Ci, you can’t stop me!”</p><p>At the same time, Xu Xiaoshou Swish appeared before another eye of the giant serpent.</p><p>Don’t fight on my face!</p><p>The Snake Lady was near collapse; she couldn’t keep up with the frenzied pace of these two abnormal humans. Before she could retreat, Xu Xiaoshou struck again with a whip kick.</p><p>“I command you, get lost!”</p><p>Clearly enraged, Taizai Ci’s Dragon Painting Spear, though later unleashed, struck faster, attempting to exhaust Xu Xiaoshou’s previous Shadow Saint’s ‘relieve the besieged by attacking the base of the besieger’ tactic, aimed at Xu Xiaoshou’s ribs.</p><p>Upon seeing that this rascal only targeted him and disregarded the Snake Lady, Xu Xiaoshou immediately went all out with his Fire Power.</p><p>“Human Realm Dao!”</p><p>“Hungry Ghost Path!”</p><p>The two of the Six Paths of ancient martial arts were activated at once, and all the surging power was channeled into his right leg in an instant.</p><p>“Break for me!”</p><p>He recklessly targeted the Snake Lady’s giant serpent form without any regard for himself.</p><p>Boom—</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was violently flung away by the Dragon Painting Spear.</p><p>This was the first time since reaching such a bounded domain with his passive skills that he had been sent flying by someone with the same brutal violence.</p><p>A bone-deep gash had opened along his ribs, and the God of War’s power surged ferociously within, exuding a sense of “growing more intense with each performance” and “getting stronger with each battle.”</p><p>But all of these, once the Engulfing Power was activated, were completely swallowed.</p><p>As for the Snake Lady…</p><p>Having lost the protection of Taizai Ci, the giant serpent’s head was burst open by Xu Xiaoshou’s kick.</p><p>“Bang bang bang!”</p><p>The sky-engulfing giant serpent began to explode from its snake eyes, bursting along its body, blasting past the vital point seven inches behind the head, and continuing until it blasted through half of the serpent’s body, where the impressive force finally exhausted and stopped.</p><p>The remaining half of the tail could no longer maintain the huge serpent’s form, transforming back into the half-bodied Snake Lady who was launched away into the distant vacuum.</p><p>Chi Chi Chi…</p><p>Blood gushed wildly; the Snake Lady was too despondent to scream.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>The onlookers shivered, feeling in the depths of their souls the ultimate agony of Xu Xiaoshou’s kick traveling from the flesh up to the spirit.</p><p>Especially when, after the kick had ended, Xu Xiaoshou turned around and unfolded his hand covering his ribs…</p><p>The wound was healed!</p><p>How on earth could such an injury heal so quickly? The eyeballs of the Twelve Holy Lords nearly popped out.</p><p>That scoundrel managed even to squeeze out a somewhat smug smile, stretching out his finger and giving a gentle wave toward Taizai Ci:</p><p>“I’ve told you, you’re not good enough.”</p><p>Taizai Ci was furious!</p><p>He was truly furious!</p><p>In front of his own Dragon Painting Spear, Xu Xiaoshou dared to brazenly attempt to slaughter his beloved Snake Lady without any concern for himself, an unparalleled provocation.</p><p>“I take back what I said earlier…”</p><p>With a thunderous sound, the God of War Armor lit up with a blood-red glow, Taizai Ci’s stature swelled inch by inch, his eyes ablaze with fury:</p><p>“Today, you’re undoubtedly going to die!”</p><p>All the saints felt the atmosphere in the vicinity plummet to freezing point as the domineering aura of the God of War turned rampant, almost engulfing everyone’s sanity like a mountain flood and tidal wave, compelling them to prostrate in fealty.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was unaffected.</p><p>He calmly gazed beyond Taizai Ci, who was now over a hundred feet tall, revealing red gold dragon scales all over his body, and he remarked with a breath:</p><p>“Then I’m quite different from you.”</p><p>“My words are as fixed as nails spat out in a single breath.”</p><p>“I said I wanted to feast on snake soup today, and not even the king of heavens could stop me from having this bite!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
