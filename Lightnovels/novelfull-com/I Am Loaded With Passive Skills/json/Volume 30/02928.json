It was time to part ways.</p><p>“Well, I’m not going. I’m just higher void.”</p><p>The storyteller, dressed in a red gown and curling her fingers, ended her statement and tossed the question back, “What about you?”</p><p>“Yeah, what about you?”</p><p>Turning his head, Hallmaster Dao looked towards Wei Feng and Elder Wuyue, “Although I brought you guys out, I won’t stop you from having further thoughts.”</p><p>Very free.</p><p>If you want to go, then go!</p><p>Wei Feng shook his head and weighed his options with Yama’s Banquet, “If it was thirty or fifty years earlier, you would only see me in the ruins.”</p><p>Now?</p><p>Forget it!</p><p>Why follow Hallmaster Dao out?</p><p>Wasn’t it just to relax, to not think too hard, to rest when not needed, and to swing the sword without a second thought when necessary?</p><p>A salted fish life needs no explanation!</p><p>Young and ambitious, Elder Wuyue glanced at Xu Xiaoshou, wondering, “Why don’t you go in?”</p><p>Elder Wuyue softly exhaled, “When everyone thinks there’s a profit to be made, it’s time to brave the rapids and retreat.”</p><p>Having said that, he looked towards Hallmaster Dao.</p><p>If the words “become Gods and Ancestor” had the greatest attraction to anyone here, then even Bazhun’an would have to settle for second place; unquestionably, Hallmaster Dao was at the top!</p><p>Yet, he wasn’t going in.</p><p>He showed not the slightest interest in the Ancestral God Fate Chart.</p><p>Presumably, he must have had some consideration, and considering he purposefully raised this question before leaving…</p><p>Was there a problem with the Ran Ming ruins?</p><p>Elder Wuyue’s mind stirred. He didn’t ask outright but instinctively turned to Bazhun’an, “What about you?”</p><p>The storyteller, following the same train of thought, looked towards their brother; perhaps Yue Gongnu had gone in too. Wouldn’t it be worth it to see him just once?</p><p>Bazhun’an, observing the shifting sand underfoot as it was lightly dispersed, casually replied, “The Holy Ancestor in the hall, the Sword Ancestor in the tower, other inheritances are far beyond reach. Why should I, just by calling out a name, be gifted with such a legacy?”</p><p>Wei Feng, Elder Wuyue, and the storyteller were all taken aback; this was a rather novel perspective.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao raised an eyebrow as well—he was certain that Bazhun’an hadn’t received any communication along the way, and neither had the storyteller. So, this was their own deduction? Thereupon he said:</p><p>“Why not try it? After all, there’s no loss. Even if you fail, you won’t die, and what if you really did obtain the Ancestral God Fate Chart?”</p><p>The storyteller nodded heavily.</p><p>He always thought that the Ten High Nobles were the most powerful contenders for the Ancestral God’s inheritance in the Ran Ming ruins; Xu Xiaoshou had to stand back a bit.</p><p>But Bazhun’an steadied his stance, and his gaze also fixed on the dust at his feet:</p><p>“Those that don’t want money may cost you your life; those that don’t want your life will cost you money. If both life and money are not sought after, then it must be a scheme.”</p><p>“If neither wealth, life, nor lust are desired, and it’s to be given for free, it must be for a kin… I don’t believe it.”</p><p>The storyteller’s brow furrowed, sensing that his brother was implying something, “What do you mean?”</p><p>Bazhun’an raised his gaze to meet his, indifferently replying:</p><p>“The price of something given freely is limitless.”</p><p>There was indeed a problem!</p><p>Even the rather obtuse storyteller realized now that there must be a problem with the Ran Ming ruins, and he was far from foolish. But before he could speak…</p><p>Bazhun’an slightly shook his head, “I do not know.”</p><p>You don’t know?</p><p>Then what are you talking about?</p><p>“Intuition.”</p><p>Some intuition!</p><p>If it was intuition for you, it couldn’t possibly be intuition for him as well, could it?</p><p>The storyteller turned to look at Hallmaster Dao, “Elder Dao the Flamboyant, do you know something, or have you calculated something? Just say it, you’re already a traitor to the sacred mountain, no need to beat around the bush.”</p><p>The surrounding few shifted their gazes all at once towards Hallmaster Dao, who simply shrugged his shoulders, “I do not know.”</p><p>“You definitely know!”</p><p>“To not know is to not know.”</p><p>“Are you going to say it or not!”</p><p>“The Way of the Heavens’ energy movement…”</p><p>“Ah—”</p><p>Frustrated, the storyteller covered her ears, looking at Elder Wuyue and implying with a squeeze of the eyes and eyebrows, “Don’t you want to know? Ask him!”</p><p>Elder Wuyue couldn’t comprehend her looks but was sufficiently curious to ask, “What happened?”</p><p>Glancing at him, Hallmaster Dao gave a gentle shake of his head:</p><p>“I truly don’t know.”</p><p>“Not everything can be foretold.”</p><p>“The Divine Secret is to seek good fortune and avoid disaster, not to get an answer from finger divination.”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>As the word “but” came out, the storyteller watched as Hallmaster Dao started to discreetly count on his fingers, feeling like throwing up his hands in resignation.</p><p>You say it can’t be calculated.</p><p>Yet when in doubt, you turn to the finger divination technique?</p><p>Soon, Hallmaster Dao’s hand retracted into his robe, a smile brimming on his face:</p><p>“Use your brains, huh? When it concerns the Ancestral God Fate Chart, that’s a matter for high-level Holy Emperors.”</p><p>“When it’s about the god slayer inheritance, that’s Godhood-Sealing and Ancestry.”</p><p>“Since everyone has a bad feeling, it’s certainly not a good thing.”</p><p>“At worst, they’ll all die in there.”</p><p>The onlookers all changed their expressions.</p><p>The storyteller’s eyebrows knotted fiercely, “Didn’t you say…”</p><p>“Latest news.” Hallmaster Dao grinned, “You can go in, but those who can’t come out will die too.”</p><p>The storyteller was only stunned for a moment, then exploded in rage, raising the hood in his hand to strangle the flamboyant Elder Dao, “Yet you still advised us to go in!”</p><p>Hallmaster Dao had already ducked away, using Elder Wuyue as a barrier, dodging as though avoiding a tiger.</p><p>“Wait a minute!”</p><p>The storyteller, having chased and suddenly stopped, exclaimed in shock and doubt, “Then Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Snap!</p><p>Hallmaster Dao snapped his fingers, “Don’t worry, there will be trouble.”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
