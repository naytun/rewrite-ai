It must be that Kong Tong has received a message from Xu Xiaoshou, right? I bet Xu Xiaoshou could hold out under his men for a quarter-hour!”</p><p>“I think otherwise; look at Kong Tong’s expression. Maybe Xu Xiaoshou survived the first wave of assassinations and, furthermore, killed one?”</p><p>“Kong Tong’s subordinate, Hexagram Saint, is not unjustly famed, and Xu Xiaoshou might well have dropped dead unexpectedly.”</p><p>“Some of you are surely underestimating Xu Xiaoshou. I bet he could counter-kill, six of them!”</p><p>“Then my judgment is, you’re also underestimating the demi-saint assassins too much.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Kong Tong felt it a waste even to glance at the people around him, with their incessant nonsensical chatter that had besieged him for over a hundred years.</p><p>He bowed his head, respectfully addressing the giant black shadow on the ground:</p><p>“Reporting to Taizai, the Hexagram Saint has fallen!”</p><p>The moment these words were spoken, the surrounding area fell silent for a beat, then was filled with an uproar.</p><p>“Kong Tong, are you playing around again?”</p><p>“Taizai, Snake Lady, and Shadow Saint are all here. How dare you show disrespect. Apologize at once!”</p><p>“I suspect this fellow probably took credit for a covert attack during this battle and has come to claim his reward?”</p><p>“In my view—ah, Snake Lady!”</p><p>“Respectful greetings to Snake Lady!”</p><p>“Greetings to Shadow Saint, to Snake Lady, and to Taizai!”</p><p>The noisy surroundings suddenly quieted down, leaving only a series of exceedingly respectful greetings.</p><p>Thud! Thud! Thud!</p><p>Along with the tremor of footsteps from the broken mountain, the giant shadow on the ground began to stir.</p><p>Kong Tong kept his head down, feeling the weight on his shoulders grow heavier.</p><p>“Swoosh…”</p><p>A fragrant breeze blew, sending a piece of red silk fluttering before him.</p><p>A shapely long leg, pale and lustrous, emerged, pressing against one’s sanity.</p><p>The crystal-clear naked foot hooked forward, seemingly targeting Kong Tong’s chin but stopped halfway, as the soft toes curled back.</p><p>“Lift your head.”</p><p>A seductive voice came, like goose feathers tickling one’s feet, inducing an irresistible itch.</p><p>“Gurgle.”</p><p>Kong Tong swallowed hard, raising his head to look.</p><p>Over the translucent red silk veiling the seductive shape, he dared not linger his gaze, quickly moving from the snow-white thigh, jumping past the slender waist one could encompass with a hand, to settle finally on the delicate, alluring face of an egged-shaped beauty.</p><p>“Respectful greetings to Snake Lady!”</p><p>He stated with utmost respect, careful not to show the slightest irreverence.</p><p>In the demi-saint circles of the Northern and Central Region, outside of the Holy Divine Palace, the Snake Lady held a pivotal status, ranking even higher than the Twelve Holy Lords.</p><p>She was a formidable fighter.</p><p>She was born a demi-saint of the Northern Region, but she could freely enter the Central Region and Northern Region.</p><p>Moreover…</p><p>The Snake Lady was the woman of Taizai Ci!</p><p>“What did you just say, that all six of your demi-saint assassins are dead?” The beauty in the red silk asked with a smile and a lingering gaze.</p><p>Kong Tong nodded solemnly:</p><p>“Yes, I am not joking.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou dispatched Hexagram Saint in just a moment; his combat strength, I’m afraid, is unstoppable even if all twelve Holy Lords joined forces against him.”</p><p>“This battle, only the esteemed Taizai will suffice to take action!”</p><p>Upon hearing this, the surrounding saints murmured amongst each other.</p><p>In just a moment?</p><p>What was this term?</p><p>Could it be that Xu Xiaoshou had also instantly killed the Central Hexagram Saint?</p><p>Snake Lady’s eyes wandered among the many demi-saints, then she covered her lips with a finger and teased,</p><p>“So you mean to say, all twelve of you at full strength couldn’t stop that mere Xu Xiaoshou… If I remember correctly, he’s only in his twenties, right?”</p><p>“Correct!” Kong Tong nodded emphatically, regardless of whether it would provoke anger from those behind him.</p><p>The Snake Lady parted her lips, and a slender forked tongue emerged, licking over her radiant lips and the white snow of her chest, saliva dripping down as she spoke:</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
