I am a good… no, I’m also a bad person…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou put away his sword, quietly gazing at the incessantly loud Yin Coffin.</p><p>It was outrageous.</p><p>The defensive power of this thing was too high.</p><p>The Raging Giant couldn’t smash it no matter how hard it thrashed or whipped.</p><p>According to Yue Gongli, with the coffin in his hands, was it doomed that he couldn’t break through the defense?</p><p>“Infused with the power of multiple ancestral sources…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes flickered as he had been bombarding the coffin for so long that he could almost discern a hint of the various powers on it.</p><p>To guard with the power of the ancestral source, could it be that the only way was to become the Ultimate Giant and punch it?</p><p>Or perhaps…</p><p>Passive Fist?</p><p>“Passive Fist (charge point: 188.44%).”</p><p>It had been a long time since he threw a punch so exhilaratingly delightful that he was unsure of what effect it might cause. Xu Xiaoshou was itching to try.</p><p>At the same time, across the coffin, Yue Gongli seemed to sense the imminent danger, and her voice turned from playful to pleading:</p><p>“Everyone is watching, I am a demi-saint, and saints must not be humiliated; let me off the hook, will you? I really do know Bazhun’an…”</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>The crowd watching was suddenly disturbed.</p><p>Brother, we are still here; are we supposed to hear this?</p><p>Could it be that if Lord Shou spares you later, the first thing you’ll do when you come out of the coffin is to silence us?</p><p>“Come out first.” Xu Xiaoshou suppressed the urge to throw a punch as wasting the Passive Fist on a mere coffin was not wise.</p><p>“You first agree not to hit me…” Yue Gongli was astute, “Then I’ll come out.”</p><p>“Come out first, then we’ll talk.”</p><p>“I’ll come out only after you agree.”</p><p>Whir!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stopped talking and took a step forward. He unleashed his Exploding Posture, and golden spots began flickering around his body.</p><p>He understood.</p><p>He knew what kind of person he feared most, in two words: crazed brute!</p><p>“Hey, hey, wait, wait!”</p><p>The voice inside the Yin Coffin suddenly became anxious, “I’m coming out, I’m coming out already, let’s discuss this face-to-face, Sheesh…”</p><p>All eyes were fixed upon the scene with tension.</p><p>But when the gray-blue coffin shook and stood on its end, then the talisman paper on the lid lighted up with red patterns filled with suppressive force…</p><p>“Whoom!”</p><p>The power of the Yellow Talisman, the power to open the coffin, began to clash.</p><p>A faint, sinister fluctuation spread out, chilling everyone’s hands and feet, and they all took a step back, not daring to get too close.</p><p>There was a prevailing sense of foreboding…</p><p>Someone clutched their chest, feeling uneasy.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The power of the Yellow Talisman suddenly failed!</p><p>After a fierce shake, the upright Yin Coffin’s lid was pushed open slightly as if by “someone” within.</p><p>Immediately, a dense, foul-smelling, and sticky gray-blue stagnation emanated from within.</p><p>“What…”</p><p>All furrowed their brows.</p><p>But before they could voice their confusion, just as the lid had barely opened…</p><p>“Shoo shoo shoo shoo shoo shoo!”</p><p>Ten black energy arcs flew from Xu Xiaoshou’s fingertips and shot into the Yin Coffin through the gap with a speed so fast it caught everyone off-guard.</p><p>Seeds on All Five Fingers!</p><p>“Ah—”</p><p>A scream resounded from within the coffin: “Xu Xiaoshou, you have no martial virtue!”</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>As the explosive source seeds flew from his hand, Xu Xiaoshou threw the Fourth Sword into the trembling Yin Coffin before it could close, shooting it in as well!</p><p>Was the sword thrust in?</p><p>Everyone looked at Lord Shou in shock, a chill running down their spines.</p><p>In a sealed coffin space, throwing in ten bombs capable of destroying the First Hall of Sins and a vicious sword that would drive any non-ancient swordsman insane—what could the outcome of such an experiment be?</p><p>No one knew.</p><p>But everyone knew…</p><p>The one conducting the experiment was definitely a demon!</p><p>“Xu! Xia! Shou—”</p><p>Inside the coffin, Yue Gongli’s screams became shrill.</p><p>Everyone could clearly see the stunning light emanating from the sliver within the Yin Coffin that was obscured by the dense vapors.</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou was filled with anticipation, “Here.”</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>It seemed like everyone heard that sound.</p><p>However, the expected massive explosion or the scene of the coffin shattering from the inside and Yue Gongli being blown out…</p><p>None of that happened!</p><p>“Thud.”</p><p>Instead,</p><p>The sound of the explosion from within the Yin Coffin was as if muffled inside a drum, faint, low, and deep.</p><p>Not louder than the sound of a foot stomp.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>It wasn’t just the onlookers; Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but harbor the same thought.</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
