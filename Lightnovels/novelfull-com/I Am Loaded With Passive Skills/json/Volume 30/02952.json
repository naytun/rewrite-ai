Is that so?”</p><p>This display of the fire-type Upanishad, let alone the surrounding people, even the demi-saints were dumbfounded.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu, Bai Zhou, Yue Gongli, all were astonished.</p><p>Water Ghost was also speechless; being a demi-saint of the higher void Upanishad, he knew better than anyone that Sleeveless’s fire Upanishad was the real deal.</p><p>But…</p><p>He also knew better than anyone!</p><p>Sleeveless, the second-in-command saint servant, did not have a fire Upanishad in the past!</p><p>Did he realize it after reaching the higher void?</p><p>Such realization quality, it’s simply too terrifying!</p><p>But soon…</p><p>Just like Water Ghost, everyone looked at Sleeveless, who was standing with his hands behind him on the array diagram, looking arrogantly proud, unable to suppress the smile at the corners of his mouth, then they looked back at Lord Shou.</p><p>In an instant, everyone’s expression turned weird.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression was also weird.</p><p>No.</p><p>After all this time.</p><p>You’re doing this in front of me?</p><p>…</p><p>“Exhilarating!”</p><p>This moment, watching the complex expressions of the surrounding people, laced with a slight confusion and a smattering of admiration.</p><p>Elder Sang admitted, he did it on purpose.</p><p>He was just after this superficial thrill!</p><p>After studying for so long, pondering for over thirty years, even at the cost of being expelled from the Holy Palace, searching for the “heretical and unorthodox paths” outside—using the higher void body to re-realize an Upanishad!</p><p>My path is complete!</p><p>This path leads to heaven!</p><p>What’s wrong with showing off?</p><p>After such a long parting, how’s it wrong for me to show off in front of my disciple?</p><p>I didn’t want it this way, it was you who forced me.</p><p>I was thinking about catching up first, asking after your well-being as part of the master-apprentice affection… then, later on, reveal this move!</p><p>But your constant blabbering is simply annoying!</p><p>So be it, I’ll just reveal it directly!</p><p>Now you’re speechless, aren’t you?</p><p>Are you overwhelmed by the old man, aren’t you?</p><p>Aren’t you a genius? Haven’t you made a name for yourself throughout the five regions in just half a year, even Bazhun’an praised you as ‘Three breaths for innate stage, three years for Sword Deity’?</p><p>Lord Shou?</p><p>Heh.</p><p>In front of the real deal, you’re nothing!</p><p>Kid, you should know that when the Four Disciples of the Holy Palace made a name for themselves, you weren’t even born yet!</p><p>“Senior Fen Qin…”</p><p>The intelligence agent following behind old man Sang couldn’t bear to watch anymore, his face twitching as he tried to interject a few words of reminder.</p><p>Elder Sang wasn’t bothered with that!</p><p>Raising his hand grandly, with a slightly haughty and preachy tone, he proclaimed in front of Xu Xiaoshou, in front of everyone in the arena:</p><p>“Back in the day, as a special envoy of the Holy Palace, I visited Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe and encountered a demi-saint old man, with whom I discussed some Spiritual Cultivation Enlightenment.”</p><p>“I believe that the Great Path knows no boundary, and a Spiritual Cultivator is not to be restricted—my insights were affirmed by him.”</p><p>“From this, I argue: to realize an Upanishad one must be of the Sovereign Dao Realm is bullshit, it is a misconception of Spiritual Cultivation!”</p><p>Chin lifted higher, nostrils flaring, Elder Sang nearly levitated off the ground, like Xiao Ye floating slightly, completely unaware of the unease shown by the loyal followers of Fen Qin behind him:</p><p>“Regardless of the Sovereign Dao Realm, Cutting Path, higher void, or demi-saint, as long as one has strong enough realization quality, anyone can grasp an Upanishad, and this is the correct answer!”</p><p>“And the array diagram under my feet is not really an array diagram; I call it an evolvable…”</p><p>“Great Path Diagram?” Xu Xiaoshou suddenly interjected.</p><p>“Exactly, the Great Path Diagram!” Elder Sang affirmed with a smile, suddenly pausing, “How did you know?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou remained silent.</p><p>The arena fell deathly silent, following suit.</p><p>Water Ghost pinched his half golden beast mask, suddenly wishing to complete it, so he could hide his face entirely.</p><p>Elder Sang looked around, already sensing something was off.</p><p>The crowd’s reaction was odd, indeed, but far too calm for those hearing such explosive news about Spiritual Cultivation—they should’ve been more responsive.</p><p>Your ‘heavens’, your ‘darns’, and all the ‘no way’, ‘yes way’, have you all gone mute? Are you dumb?</p><p>All rough fellows here, why pretend to be so proper and civilized with an old man?</p><p>Is this the time for silence?</p><p>Clap, I say!</p><p>“Clap, clap, clap…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clapped his hands, shaking his head and sighing as he walked up and even bent down to touch the illusory array diagram of the levitating old man Sang Qiye.</p><p>“Elder Sang, you’re impressive!” he exclaimed admiringly.</p><p>In an instant, Sang Qiye’s lips twitched downward sharply, he went to fling his sleeve, oh, but there was no sleeve.</p><p>So he calmly brought two fingers together and lightly tapped at the void, it was unclear what exactly he was tapping at, as he said indifferently:</p><p>“Mediocre.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou crouched on the ground and looked up, his admiration growing thicker:</p><p>“To grasp fire-type Upanishad from the higher void, you are indeed a role model for us all. Don’t be too humble, that’s false modesty!”</p><p>You?</p><p>Was this the first time he had received such a term of respect from this rebellious disciple?</p><p>The corners of Elder Sang’s mouth could no longer be contained, they stretched all the way to his temples, he reached out like the Water Ghost pushing at the golden beast mask, oh, but there was none.</p><p>He then touched his nose and laughed:</p><p>“Merely Upanishad, hardly worth mentioning.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sprang to his feet, excited:</p><p>“Not worth mentioning? What is worth mentioning then? To break through restrictions and grasp the Great Path Diagram, advancing along the Upanishad path in the higher void — if you’re not a role model for our generation, what are you?”</p><p>Ah, trifles.</p><p>Elder Sang calmed his emotions.</p><p>He was a person who knew when to stop, planning to let it go.</p><p>It was only because he was suppressing Xu Xiaoshou that he behaved like this, normally he wouldn’t be so high-profile.</p><p>“By the way.”</p><p>How clever could Sleeveless Saint Servant and Fen Qin Zhu He be?</p><p>Elder Sang quickly remembered the strangeness, he wanted to ask Xu Xiaoshou how he knew those three words “Great Path Diagram.”</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou was already dancing with excitement, unwilling to cease speaking:</p><p>“To comprehend fire-type Upanishad with the body of the higher void, this is ‘a role model for us all’.”</p><p>“Therefore!”</p><p>He looked around, at everyone:</p><p>“If someone in the Cutting Path State understands multiple major Spiritual Cultivation Upanishads and commands the Great Path Diagrams of various elements, what then should he be called?”</p><p>Everyone fell silent again.</p><p>Fen Qin’s former followers discreetly retreated.</p><p>The conversation was now pushed to the brink by Lord Shou; if they spoke any more, that’d be tasteless, impolite, asking for trouble.</p><p>The matters between master and disciple, let them handle it themselves.</p><p>Elder Sang, with hands behind his back, looked at his foolish disciple who always had shocking things to say and snickered: “How could that be possible?”</p><p>“What if there were?” Xu Xiaoshou shot back.</p><p>“Since you deem me ‘a role model for our generation,’ if there is such a person as you claim, I am willing to call him ‘Spiritual Cultivator!'” Elder Sang declared emphatically.</p><p>As soon as the words were out,</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s chin lifted, his arms folded behind his back, his body floating in the air.</p><p>His black clothes and hair fluttered in the self-generated breeze, with layers of dazzling light shining forth from beneath his feet.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>In the distance, the Overlord’s attack on the Ancestral Trees thundered, although none as piercing as the sound here.</p><p>Hum, hum, hum…</p><p>Layer upon layer!</p><p>Indeed, layer upon layer!</p><p>Elder Sang went numb, his pupils losing focus.</p><p>At that moment, the purpose of his eyes seemed to be solely to reflect the multiple Great Path Diagrams that appeared and vanished one after another under the feet of his rebellious disciple, not to be repeated.</p><p>Life, Way of the Sword, Space…</p><p>Fire, Metal, Body, Spirit, and Will…</p><p>The comprehensible…</p><p>The incomprehensible…</p><p>Time seemed to freeze at this moment, the world lost its color because it was all taken away by that rebellious disciple.</p><p>Elder Sang felt like something was stuck in his throat, clear discomfort upon his back, as if his soul had left his body.</p><p>It felt like he had waited for ten thousand years before finally hearing that condescending, dismissive comment from Xu Xiaoshou:</p><p>“Spiritual Cultivator?”</p><p>“Alright, I’ll accept that.”</p><p>“And now, my disciple, it’s time for you to call me Master.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
