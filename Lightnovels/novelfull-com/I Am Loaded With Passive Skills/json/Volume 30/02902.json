If you’re thinking about revenge, I’m afraid…”</p><p>“No,” the second true body’s lips curled slightly.</p><p>Li Fugui, hearing this decisive tone, was taken aback for a moment, then quickly reacted with regret: “Even if the flow of time is different between the Apricot Realm and the outside world, after our long talk, she would have already…”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Li Fugui stopped abruptly, looking puzzled: “Are you so confident, Lord Shou?”</p><p>The second true body grinned with a smile that was somewhat sinister and malicious:</p><p>“I’ve already called you over.”</p><p>“Never underestimate the vengeance of a petty person, especially after they’ve had their moment of triumph.”</p><p>…</p><p>Divine Relics.</p><p>A moment is an eternity.</p><p>Even if Yue Gongli managed to break free from that strange restriction in an extremely short time.</p><p>After regaining his senses, he discovered the world had fallen into stillness.</p><p>He could move.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could move.</p><p>The people around, not one could move!</p><p>“Power of time…”</p><p>Yue Gongli’s eyes flashed with a cold light, and when he looked again, he saw Xu Xiaoshou holding a scepter in his hand.</p><p>A flash of insight crossed his mind, and as someone with an extraordinary background, he immediately knew what it was.</p><p>One of the Great Psionic Weapons, the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff!</p><p>“Run… Break—”</p><p>The word “run,” forced into “break” by Yue Gongli at the crucial moment!</p><p>He clearly saw the killing intent in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes at that moment.</p><p>The Memory Returning Dagger didn’t send him away.</p><p>This beast, on the contrary, was provoked?</p><p>“`</p><p>The only consolation was that Xu Xiaoshou definitely did not yet know of Yi’s existence. As long as Yi remained hidden, there was no need to fight him now. She could be strengthened later, and repeat the assassination attempt a few more times…</p><p>“Liu Yue Mirror, break!”</p><p>As she thought, Yue Gongli made a seal with her fingers, and the cold Yin energy crept forward with time, contaminating and altering the very rules of time wherever it passed.</p><p>The Sky-covering moon appeared, illuminating and penetrating the bitter cold.</p><p>The power of time owned by Xu Xiaoshou was borrowed and couldn’t withstand a single blow.</p><p>Once the power of the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff was discovered and broken, everyone who had been immobilized could now move again, yet they shivered collectively, feeling as if their souls had been frozen…</p><p>No!</p><p>It wasn’t “ice.”</p><p>There was a sensation of thoughts gradually stiffening, bodies slowly cracking, as if being forcibly twisted from a being of the living world into that of the Underworld.</p><p>But the Liu Yue Mirror was not targeted at them. After a collective shiver, everyone realized a great battle was imminent, and they started to flee.</p><p>“Run, a holy battle!”</p><p>“Damn, they’re fighting just like that?”</p><p>“They’ve been hiding for so long, why did they start fighting as soon as Lord Shou arrived, with just a few God Fated Stars?”</p><p>“Just a few? Then I can only say you are short-sighted…”</p><p>Yue Gongli had no openings at all, not even bothering to glance at anyone in the pursuing army; she kept her gaze fixed solely on Xu Xiaoshou, her lips suddenly curling up:</p><p>“Hey, kiddo, actually, Bazhun’an…”</p><p>The conversation was barely starting.</p><p>Thud!</p><p>Everyone’s hearts pounded at once.</p><p>The ground around them suddenly sank.</p><p>Invisible ripples fell from the sky, smashing the layers of space, more daunting than Saint pressure!</p><p>Yue Gongli was caught off guard, her knees buckled, and she nearly knelt on the spot.</p><p>As a demi-saint, she could barely withstand it; everyone else fared even worse, nearly all of them being blasted into the ground by the inexplicable force.</p><p>Some were even shattered on the spot, turned to stardust and banished…</p><p>“Penetrating Divine Senses?”</p><p>Yue Gongli’s eyes widened in shock.</p><p>Without a doubt, this was the power of the Penetrating Divine Senses; she had studied it for too long.</p><p>But…</p><p>Yue Gongli stared blankly at Xu Xiaoshou opposite her, who faced her with a cold expression!</p><p>How could those Penetrating Divine Senses, integrating into the pressure, shaping the intangible into tangible, and descending from heaven to suppress, flow from his eyes?</p><p>“This kind of oppressive sensation…”</p><p>For a moment, Yue Gongli felt as if she wasn’t looking at Xu Xiaoshou, but at an Ultimate Giant that blocked out the sky!</p><p>Was he that strong?</p><p>An ominous premonition had just passed through her mind when…</p><p>The black-clad figure opposite her, who had flattened everyone in an instant, slowly raised his hand:</p><p>“Who gave you the courage, with just a Memory Returning Dagger, to dare to assassinate me?”</p><p>“And who gave you the confidence to think that you could retreat from me unscathed after a failed attack?”</p><p>Yue Gongli’s pupils contracted.</p><p>Impossible!</p><p>The Memory Returning Dagger had hit its mark—how could he know?</p><p>A demi-saint’s demi-saint incarnation could be deluded—how could he know?</p><p>“Wait…”</p><p>Before she could speak.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou brought his fingers together and lifted them slightly.</p><p>“Dragon Melting Realm.”</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Ten thousand li of white flame erupted, engulfing half the Dark Forest and enveloping all the people in the area, leaving none behind, completely confined.</p><p>“We can talk!”</p><p>Yue Gongli still wanted to struggle.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were cold and indifferent; he tapped the void gently with his knuckles.</p><p>“Exile.”</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The vast Dragon Melting Realm shifted half a foot to the side.</p><p>Whoosh…</p><p>All those who had been battered into the underground by the oppressive-type Penetrating Divine Senses felt the gravity of this part of space disappear.</p><p>Everyone panicked, flailing their arms and legs.</p><p>They were taking flight!</p><p>“`</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
