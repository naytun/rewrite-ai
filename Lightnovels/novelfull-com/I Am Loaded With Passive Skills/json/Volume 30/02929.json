Xu Xiaoshou is no longer just a pawn in the game!</p><p>Bazhun’an seemed to know what he was thinking. “Don’t worry, nothing will happen.”</p><p>How could I possibly not worry…</p><p>“Someone has entered.”</p><p>The Storyteller was startled, then his eyes widened, and he felt relieved.</p><p>Yes, someone has entered!</p><p>Among the Ten High Nobles, maybe now, everyone has to think twice before doing anything, considering the consequences.</p><p>Including his brother.</p><p>Including Elder Dao the Flamboyant!</p><p>But there was one person who didn’t need to.</p><p>The brain, he has one, yet never needed it once in his life!</p><p>A Holy Emperor of higher realms?</p><p>Ancestral God Realm?</p><p>In front of that guy who doesn’t even know how to write the word “retreat,” a problem that couldn’t be solved with one punch would be solved with ten.</p><p>If ten punches couldn’t solve the problem, then…</p><p>…</p><p>“Warm-up is over!”</p><p>The Divine, hands to his side, his palm morphing and forming a black and gold staff taller than himself.</p><p>The staff was gilded at both ends, carved with unusual pattens, and its dark red golden glow seemed to carry high temperatures, flowing gently like lava.</p><p>The middle section was simple and unremarkable, only wrapped with a very thick sealing belt, which through years of sweat absorption had turned black-brown.</p><p>“Thud!”</p><p>Such an odd staff, merely lightly touched the ground.</p><p>The earth boomed like a drum being hammered, emitting a muffled sound, and then the dust spread thousands of miles around, suddenly…</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Thousands of miles of land, all shattered.</p><p>Not just cracking like a spider-web, not just trembling into pieces.</p><p>Under this gentle touch, the ground was turned into dust, instantly the yellow sand filled the sky!</p><p>“Damn…”</p><p>Changyi stared at the big bald man two heads taller than him, feeling absolutely furious.</p><p>Who is this?</p><p>Where did this thing come from?</p><p>Has it been just over sixty years since I left the five regions, and Shengshen Continent has developed to this extent?</p><p>Merely Higher Void…</p><p>Three punches could break Deng Kou’s defense, pierce his chest, shred his belly, hammer him severely injured.</p><p>Two kicks could break Dun Ling’s legs, shatter his shield, snap his arm, making his eyeballs fly out?</p><p>Deng Kou, Dun Ling…</p><p>Are these ordinary people? These are demi-saints!</p><p>And not just ordinary demi-saints, but combat-type demi-saints hardened in battlefields, seasoned through bloodshed and life and death!</p><p>Changyi was only half a step late, and the moment he faced them, Deng Kou and Dun Ling were down.</p><p>And finishing two Saints in a blink…</p><p>This guy! This bald man! He even had the audacity to claim, warm-up is over?</p><p>“I feel, you should have something.”</p><p>The Divine casually pulled over the bald head, his foot kicked the Overlord, the heavy black and gold staff flipped in mid-air, tearing through the air, then came to rest on his forearm.</p><p>His tiger-like eyes widened fiercely, choosing his prey.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>“Little bro… elder brother, could there be some misunderstanding here?”</p><p>The War Madman Changyi, one of the Northern Region Seven Stars, appeared to be in his fifties or sixties, but was actually over a hundred years old.</p><p>Yes, he was the War Madman!</p><p>On the battlefront, he was the madman who, without a word, would strike at any ghost beast he saw!</p><p>But at this moment, he felt as if his mouth had finally grown on his body, wanting to explain something to that Higher Void bald man…</p><p>“Sizzle.”</p><p>The yellow sand floated gently.</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, the opposing bald figure had already blurred.</p><p>“Damn it, you think I’m easy to mess with? You’re seeking death!”</p><p>Changyi bellowed, his eyes suddenly turning blood red, and as his sacred realm expanded, a black longsword cleaved forward:</p><p>“Dragon-Slaying Power!”</p><p>With that shout.</p><p>Time seemed to slow down…</p><p>The dust ahead shattered.</p><p>In the vision of third realm battle consciousness, the still somewhat ethereal figure of the bald man became vividly defined in front of his eyes.</p><p>“Pop.”</p><p>The man had not arrived, but the force had.</p><p>Changyi’s hairpin split first.</p><p>A head of black hair streaked with silver swept to the back of his head in the wind.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>His cheek was cut open, a small fissure.</p><p>The blood mixed with dust smeared on his face as a long streak.</p><p>“Crack.”</p><p>His eyebrow bone made a faint crackling sound.</p><p>A slight stabbing pain pierced this body scarred from countless battles, hinting at ill omens.</p><p>“Pop, pop, pop…”</p><p>The holy weapon Dragon Protection Ball on his waist suddenly exploded.</p><p>The Xuanhu Tower, soaked in blood for over thirty years, hadn’t even had the chance to expand before it shattered into pieces.</p><p>Along with the Jade Heart Mirror, White Dragon Armor, Scale Protection Water…</p><p>Under the twisted sacred realm, even the demi-saint law couldn’t affect the bald man in front, leaving only the wind-cracked clothing, flesh, and ribs…</p><p>“What on Earth?!”</p><p>Changyi’s eyes were on the verge of bursting, feeling like he was in a dream.</p><p>The opposing staff hadn’t even swiped them yet, and his numerous protective holy weapons were successively crushed, even his protective armor and sacred physique were damaged…</p><p>What kind of human monster is this?</p><p>He’s not a Higher Void, he’s a Holy Emperor?</p><p>An unemotional, unshaken, hoarse and deep voice resonated by his ear, more straightforward than the holy martial “Dragon-Slaying Power,” its name was so simple:</p><p>“Horizontal Slap.”</p><p>The gilded staff, the black longsword, one vertical chop, one horizontal slap, in the blink of an eye, weapon met weapon.</p><p>“Schwiiiing—”</p><p>A thousand miles of vacuum, dust rose on its own.</p><p>Changyi felt a moment of darkness before his eyes.</p><p>In that instant, the bald man transformed into his long-deceased grandmother, whose face he had almost forgotten.</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
