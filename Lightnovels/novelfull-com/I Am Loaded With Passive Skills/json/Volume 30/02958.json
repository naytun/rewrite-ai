Indeed, possessing the Ancestral God Fate Chart would be the greatest chance. Still, there were other treasures to be found here… If they gathered the eighteen God Fated Stars prematurely and closed the Divine Relics early, many treasures would be forever lost… You might not need them, given your strong foundation, but those under you surely will. After this, who knows when the ruins will open again—it could be ages.</p><p>Elder Sang had much more to say.</p><p>But at this moment, looking at Xu Xiaoshou’s nonchalant demeanor, he realized that this youth was truly different from before!</p><p>Just as Xu Xiaoshou had managed to consider the information Lord Li wanted to deliver without even knowing who “Lord Li” was.</p><p>All the warnings Elder Sang had yet to voice, Xu Xiaoshou might have already foreseen.</p><p>“Fly,” Elder Sang said.</p><p>The era is yours.</p><p>With a toss, three God Fated Stars were thrown out.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu, Water Ghost, and Palace Master Bai Zhou’s expressions turned grave in an instant.</p><p>Onlookers around the Arena subconsciously began to step back, as if anticipating an unstoppable and strange phenomenon to occur.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A roar from the Overlord in the distance startled everyone.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou simply extended his hand and, without changing expression, caught the God Fated Stars, gathering all of them together.</p><p>“Hum!”</p><p>Eighteen head-sized God Fated Stars aligned on the ground, drawing each other in and collectively forming an irregular Diagram.</p><p>The earth vibrated with a humming sound.</p><p>Sporadic flashes of light flickered.</p><p>Suddenly, all the extraordinary phenomena ceased.</p><p>In Xu Xiaoshou’s mind, a clear Guidance appeared, simply two words:</p><p>Yes?</p><p>No?</p><p>At the same time, all people in the Divine Relics, including the Divine who was violently attacking the Di Ying Holy Plant, felt a simultaneous tremor in the palm of their left hand.</p><p>Water Ghost raised his hand, probed with his saint’s will, and the Ancestral God Ranking quickly popped up:</p><p>“One, Xu Xiaoshou, eighteen.”</p><p>“Two, Yue Gongli, fourteen.”</p><p>That was it!</p><p>Just like that, all subsequent names were gone!</p><p>The Ancestral God Ranking, which wasn’t particularly long but not short either and had names of six or seven people, now showed only these two names.</p><p>And the two people on the ranking had both broken into the double digits with their God Fated Stars.</p><p>This scene baffled everyone.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“I remember the Ancestral God Ranking wasn’t this short, right?”</p><p>“Even if you take out Sleeveless, Woodcutter, Bai Zhou, and group their God Fated Stars together, weren’t there still others? Like that Nian guy, Water Ghost, Zhou Tianshen?”</p><p>“Water Ghost doesn’t have any God Fated Stars, okay? He’s right here!”</p><p>“Then Zhou Tianshen…”</p><p>“Zhou Tianshen’s were already given to Lord Shou; if one has them, the other doesn’t. The numbers of gains and losses match perfectly!”</p><p>“Still… it shouldn’t just suddenly leave only two people with God Fated Stars on the ranking. There was that someone else too… who was it?”</p><p>“Huang Quan!”</p><p>“Right! Yama, Huang Quan!”</p><p>Without waiting for others to speak, almost at a glance, the Saint Servants present all knew what had happened.</p><p>After exchanging a look, even Cen Qiaofu, who was not charged with the task of cognitive thinking, spoke up:</p><p>“Just now, at this very moment, Yue Gongli found Huang Quan?”</p><p>“But earlier, Yue Gongli had five God Fated Stars, and Huang Quan three. Even together, that’s only eight…”</p><p>Water Ghost gestured dismissively, interrupting, “Sleeveless had six, and with Yue Gongli leading Holy Divine Palace’s many people to search extensively, at least nine… no, ten.”</p><p>Elder Sang’s expression darkened.</p><p>Water Ghost was too lazy for chatter, unafraid of offending, “Looking at it this way, Huang Quan’s count isn’t accurate. He definitely had more than three, at least four or five in hand—he was hiding them too.”</p><p>Palace Master Bai Zhou was stunned upon hearing this, the image of Sleeveless’s entry on the scene, with people in a row behind him passing along God Fated Stars, flashed through his mind.</p><p>He had thought that only Sleeveless worked like that.</p><p>Now it seemed…</p><p>“Isn’t it, are all of you humans so sly?”</p><p>Palace Master Bai Zhou, genuinely confused, stepped closer with a long stride and said, “How did you know you could pass them on? Why didn’t anyone tell me?”</p><p>The Saint Servants turned to look at him in unison, their gaze falling on Palace Master Bai Zhou’s flushed and alcohol-tinged handsome face.</p><p>Then their eyes quickly moved down to his ample chest and just as swiftly returned to his face.</p><p>No one spoke.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu, ashamed, covered his face and took a step back, withdrawing from the group.</p><p>Sorry, I am not worthy. I am too pure, I am guilty…</p><p>“Why are you all looking at me like that?”</p><p>Palace Master Bai Zhou asked, perplexed, puffing out his chest a bit.</p><p>He felt that their gazes weren’t so much on him as they were on someone with a disability.</p><p>“Nothing,” Elder Sang was the first to look back to his own people, undisturbed by the interruption, and asked, “How does it feel?”</p><p>“We can summon now,” Xu Xiaoshou said. He tried using his spiritual senses to circle the Guidance in his mind that couldn’t quite be called an entity, then confirmed, “We can definitely summon.”</p><p>“As long as I want, these eighteen God Fated Stars can indeed directly summon something.”</p><p>“As for whether it’s the Ancestral God Fate Chart…”</p><p>“After the summoning, whether the Divine Relics will close…”</p><p>“After closing, whether we turn back home or are trapped here, looking for another way out…”</p><p>He left it at that.</p><p>Elder Sang frowned and asked, “What do you think?”</p><p>If it had been during the Spirit Palace era, he wouldn’t even need to ask Xu Xiaoshou; Elder Sang would have made arrangements without thinking, not even needing a thorough explanation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
