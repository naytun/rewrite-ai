It was not too late!</p><p>“Hiss!!”</p><p>Following a cry of agonizing pain, every part of the Ancestral Tree’s main body and its soul body that had infiltrated the Lower Realm was completely severed away.</p><p>But…</p><p>A Hungry Ghost is always a Hungry Ghost.</p><p>Was Yi truly content with this?</p><p>“Human Realm Dao!”</p><p>With a bellow, the Asura Hungry Ghost transformed back into the human-shaped Yi, summoned back the Overlord with one hand, and heavily slammed his palm on the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar.</p><p>At this moment, the onlookers were horrified.</p><p>Everyone knew that just previously, demi-saint Cheng Guanglu had simply touched it and was mysteriously blown apart, his head shattered and semi-saint personage devoured.</p><p>Could Yi escape such fate?</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Indeed, the same explosive force detonated above the bald man Yi’s head, revealing an ominous and immense Power of Divinity.</p><p>But this time…</p><p>Yi shook his head, casting off the dizziness, and swallowed with a gulp.</p><p>“Way of Asura!”</p><p>The Hungry Ghost with three heads and six arms reappeared, seizing the power of the ancestral source, and began to eat it in parts.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s head reeled.</p><p>Yue Gongli also felt her head spin.</p><p>Such a raw method of breaking down the power of the evil god was something the two of them had never seen before…</p><p>This was the power of the ancestral source!</p><p>Could that guy really digest it?</p><p>“Yi has evolved again…”</p><p>Elder Sang silently turned his head, exchanging a look with the equally astounded Water Ghost, then shifted his gaze back to the Arena.</p><p>After the clap, the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar quickly lit up.</p><p>Having withstood the attack from that burst of evil god power, a faint glow began to appear on Yi’s body.</p><p>His body seemed to lose its weight…</p><p>His soul left his body…</p><p>His will wandered beyond the heavens…</p><p>“Feather Ascension!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to be lost in thought.</p><p>So, by pressing down on the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar, one can really ascend to the Upper Realm, that is, to the Eighteen Heavens?</p><p>But The Divine’s approach…</p><p>is too fierce!</p><p>Others go to the Eighteen Heavens in search of opportunities, but he intends to ascend to the Eighteen Heavens in pursuit of the Di Ying Holy Plant’s main body to chop and eat?</p><p>You need a supplement, but that’s not the way to eat it!</p><p>“The branches that extend from the Upper Realm are certainly part of the Ancestral Trees, but their power must be limited.”</p><p>“If you actually get to the Di Ying Holy Plant’s territory, it’s not certain that The Divine will be her match!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of this and looked towards Elder Sang.</p><p>Old Man Sang, pressing down on his straw hat, seemed to know what his confusion was about, but just lightly shook his head.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou then turned to look at the Water Ghost.</p><p>The Water Ghost also smiled.</p><p>No way!</p><p>Are you really that confident?</p><p>The Divine Relics, the Divine Relics, what if this place is The Divine’s Luofeng Slope?</p><p>Cen Qiaofu watched with a grin and burst out laughing, saying,</p><p>“The Divine will never retreat.”</p><p>…</p><p>“Hum!”</p><p>A strange sound began to rise.</p><p>Yes, The Divine would never retreat.</p><p>The Di Ying Holy Plant, however, feared this madman’s desperate actions and at the last moment, the glow on the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar promptly disappeared.</p><p>The Divine stopped his transformation and returned to his original position.</p><p>“Has the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar failed?”</p><p>Yue Gongli was shocked by this, which meant that the Di Ying Holy Plant had indeed usurped the nest, and its control over the Divine Relics had reached an appalling level!</p><p>With the chase abruptly interrupted, The Divine narrowed his eyes, his desire unfulfilled.</p><p>He even jumped in place a couple of times as if that would enable him to ascend to the Upper Realm and reach the Eighteen Heavens to find that nourishing Holy Medicine.</p><p>Useless!</p><p>However much one bounces…</p><p>A deactivated Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar could no longer assist anyone in reaching the Upper Realm.</p><p>“You can’t run away…”</p><p>Gazing toward the sky, The Divine murmured before finally turning back to look at the battlefield behind him.</p><p>“Watched, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Me?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly took a step forward.</p><p>My precious Yi! Is there anything wrong with you?</p><p>Rest a little before eating, I’m becoming afraid for the Di Ying Holy Plant. You’re not just scaring the tree, you’re scaring people as well.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>“Here, I’m here.”</p><p>“Do you understand what ‘I’ am?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t immediately grasp what The Divine was talking about.</p><p>After some contemplation, he felt goosebumps rise all over his body.</p><p>No….</p><p>Stop for a moment, please!</p><p>Your pace is too fast! The Di Ying Holy Plant was scared of you, it has retreated, it has shrunk back to the higher realm!</p><p>Not only Xu Xiaoshou, but Elder Sang, the Water Ghost, Yue Gongli, and others also felt their hearts lurch upon hearing this.</p><p>Then they saw The Divine, his face calm, began to speak confidently,</p><p>“To discern myself, Super Taoization, how my Spiritual Cultivation is, I do not know.”</p><p>“But in ancient martial arts, the moment ‘Four Sacrifice’ took place, I had already touched the True Will of ‘I’.”</p><p>Pausing, The Divine faintly raised his arm, his expression still serene,</p><p>“Watch closely, I will now teach you ‘Four Sacrifice’.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
