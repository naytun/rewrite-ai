The Saint Servant has been established only in the past few decades and can be said to know nothing about the Shadow Saint.”</p><p>“The only certainty is, to battle Taizai Ci means to battle two Saints simultaneously, and both are demi-saints who were the strongest in their respective Paths at that time, because Taizai Ci and his shadow are inseparable!”</p><p>Glancing down in recollection, Xu Xiaoshou recalled the most bizarre thing that he had almost forgotten about at the moment:</p><p>“Shadow didn’t target me, instead, he lengthened the distance between the ravine and Lady Snake.”</p><p>“By projection, the actual distance widened, and consequently, we were separated?</p><p>This is the most reasonable conjecture.</p><p>It could also be deduced that on Taizai Ci’s side, not only does he have the Holy Emperor’s Guidance power, but also the power of oblivion from Shadow!</p><p>However, this power of oblivion is far inferior to that of the Memory Returning Dagger; in front of Xu Xiaoshou, who has developed resistance and boosted his Will Dao Disc to 90%, it can be recalled in an instant.</p><p>“Interesting.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lifted his gaze, knowing that what comes next, he must face the true opponent.</p><p>Lady Snake, finding a dramatic rescue from the predicament, didn’t even think twice before her body shook violently, and she transformed into a dark purple python.</p><p>She didn’t turn back to attack but darted towards the horizon, as if to flee from the place.</p><p>“But how could I let my prey escape?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gripped the Fourth Sword, a fierce light bursting in his eyes; he absolutely couldn’t let Lady Snake get away!</p><p>This woman had only one way to go; a quick kill.</p><p>Anything else, if the battle were prolonged, Xu Xiaoshou dared not guarantee that he wouldn’t be vulnerable to her poison. In a war of attrition, he wouldn’t even be able to handle Taizai Ci.</p><p>No demi-saint is weak.</p><p>To underestimate one is to risk capsizing in the ‘yin’ ditch.</p><p>“To die once is to die, to die twice is still to die; can the will to live be a little less strong?”</p><p>While cackling like a demon, Xu Xiaoshou activated the Way of the Sword Disc beneath his feet, remotely locking onto the giant python that penetrated the void, ready to strike with the Heavenly Abandon.</p><p>Just then…</p><p>“Locked-on, Passive points +1.”</p><p>A notification popped up in the Information Bar, and simultaneously, Xu Xiaoshou felt a chill down his spine, sensing someone targeting his heart from behind!</p><p>Shadow Saint?</p><p>Swinging his sword around, the chilling sense as if spikes were on his back suddenly vanished.</p><p>The Shadow Saint seemed to have just glanced at him, not showing his face, and used the strategy of relieving the besieged by attacking the base of the besieger to rescue Lady Snake to a safe distance.</p><p>“How could you possibly escape!”</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou still wore a ferocious smile.</p><p>He harbored numerous Upanishad powers; to let that venomous snake burrow into an unknown place, becoming a ground-crouching being that continuously stacked adverse statuses on him, would be utterly ludicrous!</p><p>“Humming…”</p><p>The Space Dao Disc unfolded, and without even needing to form hand seals, Xu Xiaoshou harnessed the spatial power from all around.</p><p>“Cycle Transfer!”</p><p>Pushing what’s near away and pulling what’s distant back.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, the Spatial Upanishad Formation became intangible, having actually merged into the surrounding space and spreading out infinitely.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou seemed Taoized, but based on the Super Taoization of all three Body, Spirit, and Will Discs, he was controlling his own spiritual intelligence, not losing control like the Di Ying Holy Plant.</p><p>—In an unorthodox way, causing the Spatial Upanishad to also enter Super Taoization, with such powerful foundational three Discs!</p><p>He clearly located the Shadow Saint who could be omnipresent within these heavenly chasm shadows;</p><p>Even more so, he found Lady Snake hiding in the void, forming hand seals and attempting to poison all living beings within ten thousand miles.</p><p>“Snake, come back~ ah~ Snake, come back~”</p><p>While casually chuckling, with a thought, the space roiled like a billowing curtain.</p><p>Omnipresent shadows were repelled from all sides, and although still connected to Xu Xiaoshou’s shadow, the power was successively barred from entry.</p><p>The Shadow Saint could no longer invade!</p><p>And Lady Snake, who had escaped death by a hair’s breadth, found her hand seals becoming more fluid, all the while she was getting closer to the battlefield.</p><p>Until she could see the silhouette of the Twelve Holy Lords, she was shocked to realize something was wrong.</p><p>She hadn’t moved.</p><p>The space had.</p><p>Like rowing against the current; if not advancing, then retreating—am I courting death?</p><p>Indeed, being pushed towards Xu Xiaoshou, how could a fragile mage not be seeking death?</p><p>“Hungry Ghost Path!”</p><p>“Nine Serenities!”</p><p>To not kill is to abstain, but if killing, then to eradicate utterly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held no courteous thoughts, nor did he believe Lady Snake could revive once more.</p><p>Summoning the gates of hell with the Phantom Swords Technique, seizing the moment when the Shadow Saint was repelled, he overlaid his punch with the Heavenly Ancestor’s Power and the power of the Dragon Ancestor, piercing through the gates of hell.</p><p>Substance turned into void, flesh into soul.</p><p>A giant ghostly arm protruded from the gates of hell, tainted with the power to harm the soul, the power of both great Ancestors, and fiercely struck towards Lady Snake’s dark purple python form.</p><p>In that instant, within the python’s red eyes, absolute terror surged!</p><p>“Taizai—save—”</p><p>…</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>A dragon’s roar suddenly cleaved through the skies, manifesting a towering halberd.</p><p>The Spear Blade stabbed the ghostly arm towards the ground, and with unstoppable momentum, shattered the gate of hell conjured by Xu Xiaoshou.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
