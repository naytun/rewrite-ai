After one adventure, he now held complete control and no longer feared Xu Xiaoshou’s various schemes.</p><p>Turning his head, in the three hundred zhang deep abyss below, one could see a massive plaque that had been unearthed, with four large characters chiseled with axe and carved with knife:</p><p>“Fate Temple!”</p><p>The Fate Temple, also known as the God-Slaying Temple.</p><p>It was rumored that the god slayer Ran Ming sat within this temple, commanding fate and wielding authority over the ages.</p><p>These things, of course, were unknown to ordinary people, but Yue Gongli had some understanding.</p><p>As a successor of the Holy Emperor, he knew better than anyone what the words “god-slayer” signified.</p><p>To say that Ran Ming left behind his legacy.</p><p>Perhaps only after ascending to the Feather Ascension Three Realms and seeing his true name, one might hope to obtain it.</p><p>But to say the personal belongings of Ran Ming…</p><p>Yue Gongli never believed that only those who truly ascended to the Feather Ascension Three Realms deserved everything, while others wouldn’t even get a taste of the soup.</p><p>He wasn’t particularly thirsty for the God-Slaying power; after all, he had already obtained three parts of the power of the ancestral source. Whether the god slayer Ran Ming truly intended to pass on his legacy was still up for debate.</p><p>Entering these Divine Relics, although it was passive, he was more interested in clearing out all the treasures left behind by the god slayer Ran Ming.</p><p>For example…</p><p>“The God-Slaying Axe, the Demon-splitting Axe, these twin axes have dominated since ancient times.”</p><p>“The Shattered Shield, one of the nine supreme divine weapons, also seemed to have been left within the Fate Temple by the Void Race.”</p><p>“There were also various Divine Weapons, divine medicine, Divine Tools, things that only Ancestral Gods could use, all of which he could take to his Cold Palace Emperor Realm to decorate the facade…”</p><p>Yue Gongli was that adventurous spirit who knew everything about these treasures, their past and whereabouts.</p><p>He turned his head and looked at the handful of higher-void level beings who had managed to follow him to the Eighteen Heavens:</p><p>“Do you know, the Fate Temple was previously located in the ethereal Thirty Three Heavens of God State.”</p><p>“In other words, its location was akin to the five great secret realms above the Stairway to Heaven on the Shengshen Continent.”</p><p>“Such a treasure land, I didn’t initially think it would fall into these Divine Ruins, but everyone saw the kind of Divine Battle when we entered here, which made me discard some thoughts…”</p><p>A smile appeared on Yue Gongli’s face as he hummed:</p><p>“If Ran Ming wanted to leave behind his legacy and also hooked the triangle of God State to assemble these ruins, and even the World Tree underwent demonic transformation…”</p><p>“Then he’s probably sincere, and what he left behind is enough to make the Ancestral Trees drool.”</p><p>“As such, the Fate Temple must have been moved by him as well!”</p><p>“And if he really encountered the crisis of divine demise, in such a situation, if you were Ran Ming, what would you do?”</p><p>The higher void level beings behind him exchanged glances.</p><p>We’re not even demi-saints, how could we know the thoughts of an Ancestral God?</p><p>“If I were to die and wanted to leave behind a legacy, wouldn’t all the good treasures be collected in one spot, where the trial to obtain them couldn’t be too difficult?” An Elder with graying hair tentatively said.</p><p>Snap!</p><p>Yue Gongli snapped his fingers, his face full of approval as he pointed to the plaque of the Fate Temple and said:</p><p>“You’re right, this place, this is the Treasure Bowl!”</p><p>“For the Ten High Nobles, the most valuable thing in the Divine Relics is the rule.”</p><p>“For us mortals, the most valuable thing is right here, without a doubt.”</p><p>Mortal ordinary folks…</p><p>The surrounding higher void level beings fell silent, at a loss for words.</p><p>We can be called mortals, but are you, really?</p><p>“Yue Gongli, you only found a plaque…” someone hesitantly spoke up.</p><p>Snap!</p><p>Yue Gongli snapped his fingers again, his face plastered with a smile, mysteriously saying:</p><p>“Do you know how to enter the Fate Temple?”</p><p>The crowd immediately rustled, their spiritual senses wide open, probing the earth below once more.</p><p>But let alone the gates of the temple.</p><p>They couldn’t even find a wall of the temple, not even a brick or a tile.</p><p>“No, no, no…”</p><p>Yue Gongli laughed at the actions of these Elders, saying:</p><p>“The Yin Coffin doesn’t inherently contain Yin Spirits, the God Worship Willow Tree also has no diety to worship, so who told you that the Fate Temple can only be a ‘temple’?”</p><p>At this revelation, the surrounding people were momentarily dumbfounded.</p><p>Quickly, someone came to their senses and pointed at the huge plaque in front of them, saying:</p><p>“The Fate Temple, is this thing?”</p><p>The corners of Yue Gongli’s lips lifted into a profound smile, just as he was about to explain, he smiled wryly and said:</p><p>“Way of the Heavens’ energy movement must not be disclosed~”</p><p>The crowd’s bodies simultaneously shook.</p><p>After exchanging looks, they each brimmed with fear and disbelief rose on their faces.</p><p>Following that, one by one, they revealed ecstatic expressions, as if their brains had been eaten by dogs, their eyeballs flying freely up and down, each of them showing the face of extreme foolishness.</p><p>“No, you’ve got it wrong, I’m not Elder Dao the Flamboyant…” Yue Gongli was dumbfounded.</p><p>He suddenly realized, maybe there’s no need to explain.</p><p>This way, he could maintain an enigmatic image like Hallmaster Dao.</p><p>Because the truth was…</p><p>Back then in the Four Symbols Secret Realm, when Elder Dao the Flamboyant asked him to guard the God-Slaying Token, he didn’t fully trust that dirty-minded guy.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
