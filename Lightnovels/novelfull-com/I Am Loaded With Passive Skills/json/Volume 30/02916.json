What is the tally of their achievements?</p><p>On the Ancestral God Ranking, Cen Qiaofu is hovering between the high and the low, with only two God Fated Stars.</p><p>Elder Sang even has merely one, acting as the gatekeeper of the Ancestral God Ranking before I came in, ranked even lower than Nian.</p><p>The Water Ghost has simply vanished without a trace, hiding beneath the waters, not even willing to emit a single bubble.</p><p>Either these three are actually weak, all bark and no bite, withering in the light once they enter the ruins.</p><p>Or, they are joining forces to pull off something big!</p><p>In the past, Xu Xiaoshou might not have understood, but now the bottom dictates the mind, and not to mention Elder Sang had even told me to enter the ruins quickly during our second encounter in the Higher Void World, claiming there was a gift waiting for me.</p><p>Under such circumstances, I resolutely chose to perform my role in the Saint Servants as the “unreasonable troublemaker,” blindingly thrusting forward like a spear.</p><p>With three declaring they would have my back, I only need to worry about whether the mess I make is big and swift enough.</p><p>Second, Super Taoization!</p><p>With the guaranteed Ancestral God Fate Chart, since the Saint Servant Big Bosses are shepherding me, Xu Xiaoshou has no desire to fret over it beyond what is readily at hand.</p><p>After all, they will calculate everything meticulously, eventually delivering the God Fated Star into my hands.</p><p>Therefore, what Xu Xiaoshou truly cares about is “Super Taoization,” something even the Ten High Nobles aren’t entirely qualified to pay attention to.</p><p>The Ran Ming legacy comes in three levels: high, middle, and low.</p><p>The Ancestral God Fate Chart can only be considered second-tier.</p><p>The highest tier speaks of “Super Taoization, the Feather Ascension to the Third Realm.”</p><p>Since the Dark Forest has displayed similar rules for sustaining life, Xu Xiaoshou naturally wants to investigate thoroughly.</p><p>As for leaving a tail for Yue Gongli to chase…</p><p>The road ahead is unknown and perilous!</p><p>This is the Divine Relics, where levels reaching as high as the Ancestral God Realm, anyone could be accidentally eliminated from the game.</p><p>Of course, Xu Xiaoshou needs to ensure his own safety. This is like leaving the Fourth Sword behind without immediately withdrawing it. Although it might be consumed by Yue Gongli, when necessary, it might also serve to provide assistance.</p><p>“The Moon Fox is a smart person.”</p><p>Just from our brief encounter, Xu Xiaoshou understands what sort of character Yue Gongli is.</p><p>Admittedly, standing in opposition, he believes deeply in Li Fugui’s words and has never regarded Yue Gongli as a friend, trusting not even half a word from him.</p><p>But if an unknown enemy appears before us, one whose strength might be of the level of Super Taoization…</p><p>It will certainly also be Yue Gongli’s enemy!</p><p>Thus, the enemy of my enemy is my friend, and it is possible for us to look out (Hu) for each other (Keng).</p><p>Who looks out for whom…</p><p>That will depend on one’s strength.</p><p>Third, delving deeper into the Dark Forest, the simplest and most direct thought is that Xu Xiaoshou still has a stamp-collecting obsession—if possible, he wants to transplant the Di Ying Holy Plant into the Apricot Realm.</p><p>To have a child?</p><p>It’s nothing major, just resort to abortion!</p><p>…</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>After another abortion assisted with the Corpse King, and yet another post-abortion recovery, Yue Gongli felt numb all over.</p><p>“No, how could Xu Xiaoshou dare to run in here, isn’t he afraid of being exhausted?” he said, stuffing Elixirs into his mouth.</p><p>He had already emerged from the Yin Coffin.</p><p>He is now sitting in post-natal care on top of the coffin.</p><p>And the coffin is on the shoulder of the Six Marrow Corpse King in post-natal care.</p><p>The Six Marrow Corpse King doesn’t need to sit in post-natal care, yet was forcibly flipped upside down, its face, albeit still retaining maternal love but rather horrifying, was no different from a normal corpse’s face at this point, completely chilling.</p><p>It doesn’t have the concept of “exhaustion.”</p><p>After all, a Corpse Queen with six hearts of marrow absorption, plus being refined by the Power of Divinity, can abort any number of times without affecting the Corpse Queen at all; she isn’t weak in the slightest.</p><p>But Yue Gongli is weakened!</p><p>He felt completely hollowed out!</p><p>Time after time of Dao Infant creation, time after time of dying in the womb, along with the will turning from unbearable to numb, his very Holy Power and power of the ancestral source are also fading away.</p><p>The Corpse King has endurance.</p><p>Just like Xu Xiaoshou has Breathing Technique.</p><p>Yue Gongli, being a proper human being, has his limits!</p><p>“The latest information shows that Xu Xiaoshou has mastered the Life Upanishad, his power is virtually boundless, and he doesn’t need to consume Elixirs to replenish his strength.”</p><p>“This Dark Forest is also governed by the rules for sustaining life, not weaker than the Upanishad Level; is he here to explore the unknown?”</p><p>Yue Gongli arrived a bit late.</p><p>The real “Intent” of the Dark Forest had been scared away by Xu Xiaoshou earlier; he did not come into contact with it.</p><p>As he commands the corpses into the forest, he can only sense the remnants of power…</p><p>And these factors, though still eerie and mysterious, happen to fall within the range that Yue Gongli can control.</p><p>At least his mental state won’t become “hazy.”</p><p>Sitting on the Yin Coffin, constantly on guard against Xu Xiaoshou’s covert attacks, Yue Gongli stroked his chin, his gaze flickering, and he started to mutter to himself:</p><p>“A growing belly is not a big problem!”</p><p>“The ebb of this little power is completely within my control, and eating Elixirs can balance out the consumption.”</p><p>“The rule of life is superior; it somewhat carries a hint of ‘Super Taoization,’ so contemplating it should yield some insights…”</p><p>“Is Xu Xiaoshou venturing into this forest intending to pursue that ‘Feather Ascension to the Third Realm’ legacy?”</p><p>“Goodness, that reckless young man!”</p><p>Decent folk do not speak their inner thoughts aloud, not even forming complete sentences in their thought processes.</p><p>Clearly, Yue Gongli who considers himself to be a decent person, doesn’t even feel odd or ashamed when muttering such thoughts alone.</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
