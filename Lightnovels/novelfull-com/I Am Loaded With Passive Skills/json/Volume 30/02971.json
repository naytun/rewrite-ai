The 4th Life Invites the Killing Star to Nowhere</p><p>“Spirit Dao Disc (26%).”</p><p>With the first Profound Dao Seed planted, the quantification of the Spirit Dao Disc became possible.</p><p>As expected, the Dao of the soul is indeed no match for the Body Dao Disc.</p><p>Had it not been for the foundation laid by the Phantom Swords Technique, followed by Li Fuyu’s Fengdu Sword, and the vast experiences of shattered souls of experts he had assimilated along the way,</p><p>he might not even have broken through the 20% mark at this point.</p><p>But all problems are non-issues in the face of tens of millions of Passive Points!</p><p>Without any hesitation, Xu Xiaoshou made the most exhilarating decision:</p><p>Keep being reckless!</p><p>Reckless as hell!</p><p>“Spirit Dao Disc (35%).”</p><p>“Spirit Dao Disc (48%).”</p><p>“Spirit Dao Disc (56%).”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Spirit Dao Disc (80%).”</p><p>The hardworking farmer finally felt the agony of a great harvest.</p><p>At this point, the insights in his mind were like a surging flood, all pouring into his bladder, as if he was about to burst.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a breather.</p><p>He digested the insights from the Body Dao Disc, then the Spirit Dao Disc; the ones before Taoization, and those after reaching 80%.</p><p>Then, continue!</p><p>“Spirit Dao Disc (81%).”</p><p>“Spirit Dao Disc (82%).”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Spirit Dao Disc (90%).”</p><p>Whirr!</p><p>The world spun once more.</p><p>That sensation of reaching the limit and touching the shackles emerged again.</p><p>This time, it was his own soul that felt light and ethereal, as if it was about to shed its shell and ascend to the higher void.</p><p>But previously, Xu Xiaoshou was not accustomed to it and needed to search for a while to find his own body.</p><p>This time, with a 90% Body Dao Disc as the foundation and anchoring himself with his own essence, he easily summoned his soul back using the No Sword Arts “Heavenly Abandon” method of self-anchoring.</p><p>“Success!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Two of them!”</p><p>“Lord Shou already has two supreme Upanishads beyond the limits; is his talent really so exceptional?”</p><p>They say, “Time ceases to exist in cultivation.”</p><p>But Lord Shou closed his eyes for less than two days.</p><p>Although there was a long pause in between, his supposed Soul Upanishad Array Diagram quickly and efficiently reached final-stage after resuming operation.</p><p>This was shockingly fast!</p><p>Not to mention the higher void level, even a Spiritual Cultivator at the Sovereign Dao Realm would not have such a short duration for a seclusion to seek Enlightenment, usually taking at least three to six months.</p><p>As for Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>This fellow was cultivating as easily as drinking water, all in one breath?</p><p>“Tsk.”</p><p>Elder Sang glanced at the people around him.</p><p>The Dao of the soul is not as obscure as ancient martial arts, many have delved into it.</p><p>While Xu Xiaoshou has completed his path and come to a stop, most of the Spiritual Cultivators around who were led into an epiphany by the path energy have yet to emerge.</p><p>And at this juncture, the people from the Holy Divine Palace at the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Dead ones dead, the capable ascended.</p><p>The rest, not strong enough to serve as cannon fodder, have left or hidden themselves, completely dissociating from the upcoming grand scheme.</p><p>“Should we wake him?”</p><p>The Water Ghost raised his left palm and looked over, “It’s sixteen.”</p><p>Indeed, the Ancestral God Ranking had been updated twice, with Yue Gongli’s God Fated Star count nearing Xu Xiaoshou’s.</p><p>If he still had one or two hidden away, he would already be eligible for the Ancestral God Fate Chart.</p><p>In theory, he could also order a halt to the exploration of the Divine Ruins.</p><p>Nobody anticipated that Xu Xiaoshou would need so much time to reflect after sitting down.</p><p>Though two days for Enlightenment couldn’t be considered long,</p><p>This was a breakthrough in the limits of Upanishad… even, it might be said, frighteningly brief!</p><p>But at this critical juncture, two days were indeed tormenting.</p><p>Yue Gongli suddenly switched from passive to active, about to find the pivotal move that could turn the tables.</p><p>“No rush.”</p><p>Elder Sang seemed quite pleased, showing not the slightest trace of worry. Instead, he turned to the person beside him and asked:</p><p>“What is the most precious thing in the Divine Ruins?”</p><p>“The Ancestral God Fate Chart?” Cen Qiaofu hesitated, then remembering everyone’s assertions that there was something amiss with the Ancestral God Fate Chart, he offered another answer, “The God Fated Stars?”</p><p>“Isn’t that still the Ancestral God Fate Chart?” Bai Zhou interrupted, by now considering himself tied to the same fate as the First Pavilion in the Sky, at least in his own mind.</p><p>“Then… the Demon-splitting Axe? The God-Slaying Axe?” Cen Qiaofu asked eagerly, “One a supreme divine weapon, the other exclusive to the god slayer…”</p><p>“You do seem quite suited for it,” Elder Sang remarked, glancing at the small axe at his waist.</p><p>“Not that either?” The Old Woodcutter gleaned his meaning, “Then what is it?”</p><p>“It’s Ran Ming’s legacy, isn’t it!”</p><p>Bai Zhou shot a meaningful glance at Xu Xiaoshou, suggesting,</p><p>Cleanse myself, Super Taoization, Feather Ascension Three Realms, witnessing the true name… Impossible for others, but Xu Xiaoshou just might have a chance.</p><p>However, Cen Qiaofu shook his head.</p><p>Even without voicing it, he had long realized that Elder Sang and the Water Ghost did not favor Ran Ming’s legacy.</p><p>Considering that the Di Ying Holy Plant from the World Tree had undergone a demonic transformation to such an extent,</p><p>To say that Ran Ming’s legacy hadn’t been tainted at all, or never targeted, or that the Ancestral Trees hadn’t been attempted to be infiltrated… even Cen Qiaofu himself found it hard to believe.</p><p>Seeing the puzzlement on everyone’s faces at the cryptic conversation, Bai Zhou turned annoyed, “So what is it?”</p><p>Elder Sang didn’t keep them guessing, pointing down to the earth below and saying:</p><p>“The most valuable thing in the Divine Ruins is the Divine Ruins themselves.”</p><p>Bai Zhou’s mind almost tied itself in knots from the turnaround, finding the statement more irksome than a riddle. It lacked any semblance of culture, so much so that even someone of his Palace Master stature couldn’t comprehend it.</p><p>“What does that mean?”</p><p>All eyes turned towards him.</p><p>But Elder Sang only looked at his disciple and said pointedly:</p><p>“Whether or not we meet the god slayer Ran Ming is another matter.”</p><p>“The rules of the Divine Ruins are of such a high order that the threshold to meeting It has been reached, so whether we see It or not no longer matters.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
