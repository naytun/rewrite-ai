How is this all different from what the reports recorded?” Qin Guan wore a puzzled expression.</p><p>“No, the intelligence mentioned it, you probably overlooked it. Before the Ultimate Giant tore apart the Holy Emperor Qilin, Xu Xiaoshou had already demonstrated this battle form,” Kong Tong was equally stunned.</p><p>“Yes, this is the power of the Dragon Ancestor, but can it withstand the God of War’s power from the great Taizai Ci…” Some harbored doubts.</p><p>Indeed, the current Berserk Giant was of a size that could match the gargantuan transformed form Taizai Ci took upon activating the God of War’s power.</p><p>The dragon-scale armor manifested from the power of the Dragon Ancestor seemed to be on par with the God of War Armor.</p><p>Taizai Ci possessed one of the Great Psionic Weapons, the Dragon Painting Spear, while behind the Berserk Giant hung the Fourth Sword and Flame Python, both massively transformed famed swords.</p><p>Undoubtedly, from the surface, it seemed an equal match.</p><p>But…</p><p>“I heard Xu Xiaoshou also possesses Heavenly Ancestor’s Power?”</p><p>“But Lord Taizai Ci has been a demi-saint for a century, with profound heritage that cannot be shaken.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou’s Ancient Sword Technique is also very skillful, and he practices ancient martial arts…”</p><p>“With both paths of ancient martial arts, skills in The Divine, body trained like Taizai, Lord Taizai Ci will not lose; Xu Xiaoshou will only be crushed!”</p><p>The battle, amidst whispers, was on the verge of exploding.</p><p>Both giants, despite their giant sizes, possessed terrifying speeds that when they suddenly burst forth, could tear through sonic booms and collide at the original spot.</p><p>“Boom, boom, boom…”</p><p>In just a moment, the Dragon Painting Spear and the Berserk Giant’s fists collided countless times, while the Fourth Sword and Flame Python also attempted to slice through the God of War Armor during their flight.</p><p>Yet, both their defenses and reactions were too strong!</p><p>The moment one side made a move, the other side already countered.</p><p>Retreating or diverting force, countering move for move, attack for counterattack, they fought to a point hard to separate.</p><p>The roaring explosions moved from the frontlines to beyond the skies, then tore through the space returning from the distant void.</p><p>It finally ended with each receiving a strike from the other’s weapon, momentarily disengaging from the battle.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>No sweat was visible on the bodies of the two giants in the Arena.</p><p>However, the demi-saints watching outside were all shaken to the core.</p><p>Wielding the sharpest weapons, using the mightiest powers, the clash these two giants unleashed was simple, brutal, and dizzyingly close-range combat.</p><p>“Purely clashing combat experiences and reactions…”</p><p>“If it were me, missing one counter means a kick from Lord Taizai Ci, followed by his spear, could split one of my incarnations on the spot!”</p><p>Qin Guan silently turned back, looking at the Holy Lords beside him, and saw heavy expressions on their faces.</p><p>Yes, putting oneself in their position, most couldn’t withstand Lord Taizai Ci’s attacks.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou withstood them!</p><p>This meant that what Kong Tong said earlier was indeed correct.</p><p>Even if all twelve Holy Lords joined forces, they might not match this kid; it really needed to be handled personally by Lord Taizai Ci.</p><p>However…</p><p>“Lord Taizai Ci, though brave and good at fighting, mostly fights directly but now struggles to take down this fellow.”</p><p>“This Xu Xiaoshou, besides terrifying battle consciousness, is very cunning, usually resorting to direct combat only as a last recourse…”</p><p>The multiple Holy Lords’ thoughts had not finished when, in the midst of the battlefield, Taizai Ci suddenly burst out laughing:</p><p>“What a thrill! Well done, Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“Unexpectedly, even today on this continent, there exists someone who can withstand such an attack from me and still not a demi-saint; you are probably not much weaker than that so-called The Divine.”</p><p>Then you really shouldn’t say that, I’m actually quite a bit weaker than him… Xu Xiaoshou spoke up:</p><p>“Do you enjoy empathizing with each other that much?”</p><p>A single sentence left the giant-transformed Taizai Ci frozen on the spot, and all the demi-saints around were also startled.</p><p>“Do you think this is an instance of a hero sparing another hero, just by getting chummy with me, I’ll let you go?”</p><p>The Berserk Giant spoke again, tightening Taizai Ci’s grip on the Dragon Painting Spear, his eyes under the iron helm turning bloodshot, his whole body overflowing with killing intent.</p><p>“Just a warm-up and I haven’t made a serious move yet, and you’re already breathless? You’re a bit too quick!”</p><p>“How dare you!” Taizai Ci could no longer restrain himself, picking up the Dragon Painting Spear and thrusting furiously.</p><p>But the Berserk Giant didn’t stop his provocations: “If this is the level of your ability, better go home, wash up, and sleep. Today, none of your people will be safe, I guarantee it!”</p><p>“Shut up—”</p><p>Taizai Ci roared, a vague form of Kui manifesting behind him, while the dragon chant on the Dragon Painting Spear deepened.</p><p>Before even confronting him, Xu Xiaoshou already felt his step heavy as if overwhelming forces were pressing down like mountains.</p><p>Yet, the corners of the giant’s lips seemed to rise, as if his trick had succeeded.</p><p>“I said, today, I start with a snake soup.”</p><p>He had no intention of facing the blow, his gigantic body tipping backward as if sinking into the deep sea, disappearing from sight.</p><p>When he reappeared, he descended from the skies, landing right on the face of the Snake Lady hidden in the farthest part of the battlefield!</p><p>Close combat?</p><p>Close-range output was only a small part of Xu Xiaoshou’s strength, or even a very tiny part.</p><p>Practicing three paths with the Body Spirit Sword, his most terrifying aspect lay in “Trickery.”</p><p>What move would come next, the typical Taizai Ci couldn’t even defend against, much less now that he was somewhat overwhelmed?</p><p>This spatial shift, undoubtedly, surprised everyone.</p><p>Not only did Taizai Ci’s spear miss the mark, but even the Twelve Holy Lords and the Shadow Saint hadn’t expected it—that after a fierce man-to-man battle, Xu Xiaoshou would suddenly turn to seek another, leaving no chance for reinforcements.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
