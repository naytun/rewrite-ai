What’s about to happen, even This Saint cannot control.”</p><p>“Perhaps if you run fast enough, you can cling to life~”</p><p>The crowd was still perplexed, but then…</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>The lid of the Yin Coffin completely came loose, the crack widening more and more until it “boom” hit the ground.</p><p>This grayish-blue coffin was standing up, facing away from Xu Xiaoshou and most of the people.</p><p>Spiritual senses could not probe in.</p><p>No one there possessed the saint’s will.</p><p>Only an extremely small number of busybodies were facing the Yin Coffin directly, able to witness the truth inside as soon as the coffin lid fell…</p><p>“Oh, to hell with it.”</p><p>That was all one could hear.</p><p>No one knew what had happened.</p><p>Among those dozen people, including those from the higher void, just one glance filled with sudden fear and shock…</p><p>“Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!”</p><p>They all exploded into stars!</p><p>All shredded by a strange force from inside out!</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Now everyone got the message. What was inside didn’t matter, what mattered was…</p><p>“Run, damn it!”</p><p>“What are you waiting for? Looking to die?”</p><p>Thousands scattered like a flock of startled birds.</p><p>Zhou Tianshen pulled his foot out and as his lower body flew off, his head still glanced at Xu Xiaoshou, wanting to ask if he could be saved; if possible, he wanted to observe the fight and learn from it…</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>The sharp-faced man, who had just mocked the Holy Divine Palace for being weak, grabbed this one-armed youth by the waist as he passed and gruffly shouted:</p><p>“Holy battle, big brother!”</p><p>“You’re only at Sovereign Dao Realm, when Lord Shou enlarges and puts you in his mouth, you could dissolve completely!”</p><p>…</p><p>Power of Divinity!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart tightened.</p><p>He saw more clearly than anyone else.</p><p>Just now, those who were mysteriously shredded had witnessed an overwhelming Power of Divinity, as if “Meeting a Saint” in an instant!</p><p>Power of Divinity was actually quite common by now.</p><p>After all, it existed in Lei Xi’er’s God Devil Eyes.</p><p>But she was only at Sovereign (Stage), unless she was willing to go all out like the last time in front of Holy Emperor Bei Huai, under normal circumstances the quality and quantity of Divinity she could control were very low.</p><p>Compared to demi-saints and Holy Emperors, it was a drop in the ocean!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was the same.</p><p>He too controlled the Heavenly Ancestor’s Power, the Dragon Ancestor’s Power, and he even possessed the complete Heavenly Ancestor Legacy.</p><p>But so far, his Heavenly Ancestor’s Power was used solely to deal additional damage, to resist the ancestral source power of other demi-saints.</p><p>Just like how Holy Power is only within the grasp of a demi-saint.</p><p>Ancestral source power is something that only a Holy Emperor of higher realms can comprehend.</p><p>For one to obtain this power against regular order, compared to one’s peers, is undoubtedly great; but compared to someone naturally attaining such strength and being able to control it readily… it’s a whole different story.</p><p>Just like a hardworking genius who can surpass their own realm in battle but tries to challenge the Ten High Nobles, who naturally excel in such fights—it’s rather overambitious.</p><p>And now!</p><p>Such terrifying quality and quantity of Power of Divinity, or to put it another way, the Power of Divinity from one of the Ten Ancestors, the Holy Ancestor!</p><p>Meeting a Saint was daunting enough, but faced with such a concentration of the Holy Ancestor’s Power was like looking straight into the eyes of an Ancestral God…</p><p>Self-destructing was the least of it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou even wondered if the residual power of the god slayer Ran Ming could protect the spiritual will of those just now who exploded!</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>With the surging of a noxious fog.</p><p>A giant pale foot stepped out from the three-meter high vertical coffin.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>It landed on the ground, causing the earth to sink.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked on unflinchingly, feeling a tumult in his spirit, but not to the point of bursting at a single glance—he had long passed that stage.</p><p>This bloodless giant foot dug into the ground, straining against the Yin Coffin’s pull for a long while before finally pulling out another big leg and an upper body.</p><p>Finally, with a pop, a giant head emerged as well.</p><p>It was enormous!</p><p>This thing was too bulky!</p><p>The Yin Coffin could accommodate a Yue Gongli, but to contain a Raging Giant, which was just over three meters tall but even broader in girth…</p><p>It was like stuffing the Four Disciples of the Holy Palace and a platter of roast goose into a tiny, cramped hut.</p><p>“Heh…”</p><p>The Raging Giant’s body, with its back turned to all those fleeing in panic, let out a long sigh, exhaling a long stream of the Holy Ancestor’s Power capable of tearing through space and Path Principles before it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s right eyelid twitched rapidly a few times.</p><p>“Goodness…”</p><p>It was his first time seeing such a tangible Power of Divinity, visible to the naked eye.</p><p>Just this single breath contained an amount of ancestral source power that was not much weaker than the Arrow of Evil God that Ai Cangsheng shot towards the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>Thud!
