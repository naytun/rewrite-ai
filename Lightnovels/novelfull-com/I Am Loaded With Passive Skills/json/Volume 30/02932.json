Even if the Di Ying Holy Plant was still perceptive, its first reaction would certainly be to devour the coffin and Yue Gongli first.</p><p>This was the best strategy of sacrificing others to save oneself.</p><p>His backup plan with the Fourth Sword was initially aimed at Yue Gongli, but it hadn’t returned to his hands yet. After the sudden emergence of the Di Ying Holy Plant, he immediately set an anchor point on the spot.</p><p>His second true body was far outside the Divine Relics, and his connection was severed at that moment.</p><p>Relying on 80% of the Way of the Sword Disc and the strong bond formed between the sword cognition and the vicious sword, Fourth Swords, he could still vaguely sense where the Fourth Swords were, even though this dark world severed all his connections with the outside.</p><p>That had to be the only way out!</p><p>Perhaps the location of the Fourth Swords was also covered by the dark world of the Di Ying Holy Plant.</p><p>But at the very least, its coordinates were probably the only ones that could lead back to the Dark Forest and the Divine Relics.</p><p>Using spatial teleportation to go there was a middling strategy.</p><p>Why a middling one? Because that was exactly how they were guided into this strange world—who knew what other accidents might occur?</p><p>As for the worst strategy…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could certainly transform into the Ultimate Giant and beat the tree with his fists;</p><p>Or he could draw out the Flame Python and employ all he had learned from the second realm of the Ancient Sword Technique, directly targeting the Di Ying Holy Plant to test its strength.</p><p>But what about Yue Gongli?</p><p>Was he supposed to just munch on seeds and watch the show?</p><p>They had entered together, so why should I suddenly become your pawn, working for you, while you comfortably watch from inside your coffin?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not foolish!</p><p>He still remembered what Li Fugui had said.</p><p>You can’t believe a word that comes out of Yue Gongli’s mouth.</p><p>That guy was also in a dangerous situation, bold and quick to react; and in just a couple of seemingly nonsense flirtations, he had accomplished his goal and hid inside the coffin to watch others perform.</p><p>It even made people furious, and it seemed that the only option was to follow through and perform.</p><p>But to reveal his trump card in front of Yue Gongli, to use his sword techniques, show the strength of the Ultimate Giant, even reveal Independence, or possibly the Passive Fist…</p><p>To let the Di Ying Holy Plant work for him and test his own strength in reverse?</p><p>Afterward, if he could break through this world, he would break through it.</p><p>If not, he would come out and break through it himself. After settling favors, could you still target me once we all left the Divine Relics?</p><p>Control was often handed over in such confused situations.</p><p>To outsiders, all of Yue Gongli’s schemes could probably deceive the entire world.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou was no longer a naive bunny.</p><p>After experiencing from the Four Symbols Secret Realm to Qingyuan Mountain under the tutelage of Hallmaster Dao, his perspective had far broadened. How could he possibly allow this ‘Moon Fox’ to scheme so openly without realizing it?</p><p>That would be foolish!</p><p>“Boom—”</p><p>As the black tsunami was about to hit his face, the feigned panic in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes disappeared, and so did the tension.</p><p>A golden light broke through the sky, and the Raging Giant stepped onto the stage.</p><p>Following the Giant, the Ultimate Giant entered the scene.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Golden lightning shot from the Yin Coffin up into the sky, breaking through the black wave and scattering countless branches.</p><p>“Wow~” a surprised voice came from inside the coffin:</p><p>“That’s it, just right, really tough!”</p><p>“Lord Shou! Hit her! Let this tree see the real strength of us humans, to not reciprocate would be discourteous!”</p><p>“Daring to chase us? Can’t we just give her a punch to burst her?”</p><p>And to be sure, these provocative words really stirred a surge in Xu Xiaoshou—a sudden impulse of “Are you really calling yourself Di Ying Holy Plant?”</p><p>The Passive Fist was almost activated!</p><p>But when that strange feeling flashed by, without needing a Spirit Awakening, Xu Xiaoshou realized he was again being guided.</p><p>Yue Gongli, only a sentence away from the Holy Emperor, “I do.”</p><p>But a miss is as good as a mile, his power of guidance surfaced, and under his vigilance, he could feel an anomaly was added to himself.</p><p>“Damn thing!”</p><p>After cursing inwardly, Xu Xiaoshou not only held back his punch, but facing the tide of branches that rebounded from his own shock and surged back…</p><p>Yes, a tide.</p><p>Under the terrifying size of the Ultimate Giant, even a small wave had its height.</p><p>It couldn’t seal the top of the Ultimate Giant’s head, only flooding below his abdomen.</p><p>But that was huge enough!</p><p>Facing such a massive quantity of assaulting branches, the Ultimate Giant crouched down, then shielded his head with his hands, taking a defensive stance…</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Seeing this from within the Yin Coffin that was blasted underground by the horrifying squatting air wave, Yue Gongli was clearly stunned.</p><p>What kind of powerful move was this starting pose? Was Xu Xiaoshou planning to use this posture to push the tsunami back onto the Di Ying Holy Plant’s face?</p><p>But in an instant, he dismissed this bizarre possibility, as the Ultimate Giant’s body lit up with golden light.</p><p>“Acalanātha!”</p><p>The golden light was faint, but it shone from the terrifying size of the Ultimate Giant, like the Brilliant Sun.</p><p>The golden light was shallow, but appearing in this purely dark world, it surpassed daylight.</p><p>“Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom…”</p><p>The defensive stance had just begun when endless tsunami branches penetrated the Giant’s body…</p><p>Wrong!</p><p>Not penetrated!</p><p>From inside the Yin Coffin, Yue Gongli’s eyes widened.</p><p>Those seemingly indestructible branches, upon touching the layer of golden light on the Giant’s body, actually shattered.</p><p>Thousands of billions of branches assaulted him, shattering endlessly, and though they gradually wore down the golden light with their sheer quantity, they couldn’t penetrate it.</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
