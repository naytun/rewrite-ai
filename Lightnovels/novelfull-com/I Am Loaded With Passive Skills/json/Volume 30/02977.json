Since you’ve spoken, it only proves you haven’t figured it out; you’re simply a naïve fool.”</p><p>“Haha, Old Cheng, you’ve really penetrated the… *cough cough*… the extent of his realm.”</p><p>“Hmph, of course!” Old Cheng crossed his arms.</p><p>“Could it be, simply a code?”</p><p>“Rejection. Too superficial; you’re at the first layer.”</p><p>“Then, just a simple joke?”</p><p>“What status do you have for him to joke with you?”</p><p>“Oh, right, that too.”</p><p>…</p><p>In the Divine Relics, the First Heaven.</p><p>“Discern me, Super Taoization, Feather Ascension Three Realms, to see the true name…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt he didn’t need to sacrifice anything; just let go of his body and self, and he would ascend to the Eighteenth Heaven.</p><p>But right now, he didn’t want to “ascend” in this way.</p><p>“Summon!”</p><p>Ten God Fated Stars converged, and the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar descended from the sky forthwith.</p><p>Above and below, the two parallel heavens, amidst thunderous roars and billowing smoke, erected a bridge that enabled passage.</p><p>Everyone was waiting.</p><p>Everyone’s gaze fell onto the youth in black sleeveless garments leading the way.</p><p>“Let’s ascend to heaven and fight.”</p><p>To Lord Shou, this was an ordinary sentence.</p><p>To the ears of the others, it was a symbol, a struggle for the Great Path, and a struggle for vengeance!</p><p>Everyone knew that the layout of the Divine Relics had been rewritten. With Yue Gongli’s character, the Eighteenth Heaven was surely lying in wait with a deep trap.</p><p>But to retreat?</p><p>The Divine never retreats.</p><p>Nor do the Saint Servants!</p><p>With everyone in tense anticipation, Xu Xiaoshou slowly extended his withered and scorched hand.</p><p>He obviously knew that anyone who touched this pillar had to withstand an attack from the power of the evil god.</p><p>The strength of this attack had already been verified by the people of the Holy Divine Palace:</p><p>Before the Di Ying Holy Plant was chased away by The Divine, even a demi-saint couldn’t withstand it.</p><p>After the Di Ying Holy Plant shrank back into the heavens in disarray, a demi-saint could ascend, and some with strong combat strengths from the higher void could too!</p><p>But now…</p><p>Everything could no longer be investigated.</p><p>“I’ll do it.”</p><p>After some mental struggle, Elder Sang felt he shouldn’t let his beloved disciple take the risk, even if his disciple’s combat strength might have exceeded his own.</p><p>He was about to sacrifice himself to demonstrate a teacher’s love.</p><p>One glance from Xu Xiaoshou, and he was glared back into retreat.</p><p>Such a minor higher void, truly absurd.</p><p>Do I need a pawn?</p><p>I am the most resilient tank there is!</p><p>“Smack.”</p><p>A palm was placed.</p><p>A surge of power seemed to emanate, causing everyone to retreat in unison, with Elder Sang sprinting the fastest.</p><p>“Hum.”</p><p>The Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar lit up.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a clear guidance coming from within his spiritual will, which still boiled down to two words:</p><p>Yes?</p><p>No?</p><p>One thought to ascend directly to heaven!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned, but instead of ascending immediately, he lowered his hand and looked towards Elder Sang, who had run the furthest:</p><p>“Perhaps he guessed that I have achieved something, and I would surely withstand the first attack, so he spared the first attack to create the illusion that there was no attack.”</p><p>He patted it several more times, but the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar showed no reaction.</p><p>“Let’s change the person.”</p><p>So, it’s my turn?</p><p>Elder Sang took a deep breath; he didn’t refuse and prepared to step forward into danger.</p><p>Water Ghost raised his hand, “I’ll do it.”</p><p>The half-saint with an Element Body of water-type Upanishad, stronger than the non-ancient martial second-generation Penetrating Divine Senses Sleeveless· Red Scorched Body, at least that’s what Water Ghost believed.</p><p>Though Penetrating Divine Senses was strong, it was restricted by the Higher Void State, just like supreme divine weapons in the hands of children, or the power of the ancestral source in average Sovereigns; its potential was inevitably limited.</p><p>And in the realm, with equal talent, it could revert to the Sovereign Path!</p><p>Water Ghost, without further ado, passed by everyone and slapped his hand onto the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar.</p><p>“Snap.”</p><p>Ripples surged in the void, with no anomalies in sight.</p><p>Elder Sang laughed, “You two are too suspicious. In my opinion, the Di Ying Holy Plant has already been chased by The Divine to the Thirty Three Heavens; Yue Gongli is not the World Tree after all, unable to interfere with the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar…”</p><p>He spoke while casually placing his hand on the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar, even turning his head back to look at everyone:</p><p>“See, nothing happened, right?”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Right after he spoke, Elder Sang’s head swelled violently, and as blood spurted from all seven orifices, a massive amount of the power of the evil god simultaneously burst forth.</p><p>It was like gas obstructed by something solid could only erupt from the weakest of orifices.</p><p>“Arghhh—”</p><p>Elder Sang covered his head with one hand, as endless Violet Qi exploded from his body, like a purple version struck by arrows within the Eighth Palace.</p><p>But today was not as it once had been.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Elder Sang shouted abruptly, never loosening his death grip on the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, of course, knew that the old man wasn’t asking to be saved by him, but used this opportunity to discern the true nature of the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar, to see the source of this attack.</p><p>“Hold on.”</p><p>He sidestepped, the Will Dao Disc spun out, Unity of Man and the Heavens opened directly…</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>His brain shook.</p><p>Body and soul seemed to vanish simultaneously.</p><p>With 90% of the Great Dao Disc used in conjunction with the Special Passive Skill Unity of Man and the Heavens, Xu Xiaoshou was experiencing this mysterious state for the first time.</p><p>In an instant!</p><p>He felt himself having left his original place.</p><p>The intent of billions of living beings merged into his.</p><p>The Guidance of the endless rules of the Great Path became his to command.</p><p>A terrifying idea that he had not dared to contemplate before emerged in his consciousness, and without hesitation, Xu Xiaoshou enacted it:</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>He easily split off a thread of consciousness, like a Demi-Saint’s thought incarnation or even a Holy Emperor’s thought incarnation, traveling beyond the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar, straight to the Eighteen Heavens.</p><p>During this process, the consciousness clearly discerned a “mockery,” “rampaging,” and “triumph” sense of satisfaction from the descending power of the evil god.</p><p>“Di Ying Holy Plant!”</p><p>But in the blink of an eye, with the shifting of light and shadows, the consciousness, as though breaking through some unknown barrier, arrived in a new world.</p><p>Here, both gravity and spiritual energy were much stronger.</p><p>From the distribution of spatial nodes and the density of Unowned Holy Power, one could easily deduce…</p><p>The Eighteen Heavens!</p><p>The Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar here was represented by patterns, surrounded by the Six Demi-Saints.</p><p>As if sensing something, all six demi-saints stood up at the emergence of the consciousness:</p><p>“Demi-Saint’s thought incarnation?”</p><p>“Has Xu Xiaoshou ascended to sanctification and come chasing up here?”</p><p>“Summon the Wangze Holy Emperor, we’ll strike this down first and prevent the consciousness from taking any information back!”</p><p>Pfft—</p><p>A strange noise.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was already accustomed to self-sacrifice; to others, this consciousness might be precious, but he discarded it as if it were a worn-out shoe, self-immolating on the spot.</p><p>The Unity of Man and the Heavens from the Will Dao Disc was naturally not a Demi-Saint’s thought incarnation.</p><p>At the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar, Xu Xiaoshou almost simultaneously learned of the situation in the Upper Realm and turned to say:</p><p>“Elder Sang, you can withdraw now.”</p><p>“Water Ghost, cover our retreat; anyone in the Higher Void capable of battle and gathering intelligence can follow, everyone else stay out of it.”</p><p>“I will go up first; everyone else, join me after half an hour.”</p><p>“Wait…” Water Ghost hadn’t grasped the situation yet and wanted to ask a few more questions.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand.</p><p>“Relax, there are only six.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
