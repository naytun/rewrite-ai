The rules of the Divine Relics are not just one level higher than those of the Shengshen Continent.”</p><p>Indeed!</p><p>This point, Xu Xiaoshou had already experienced.</p><p>Simultaneously, he also understood what The Divine was actually saying:</p><p>Right after entering the Divine Relics, Xu Xiaoshou sensed the high-level rules of this place.</p><p>A famed sword needs to be self-concealed and voluntarily dissipated on the Shengshen Continent, but that may not be necessary here.</p><p>Spiritual medicine and Holy Medicine need to be self-concealed over there, but here they can grow vigorously.</p><p>Even the Upanishad, in the five regions, 80% is the limit, touching any further would mean assimilation by the Great Path.</p><p>Here, it seems possible to push a little further forward before reaching that “taboo”.</p><p>“It’s good you understand.”</p><p>Seeing Xu Xiaoshou’s comprehension, The Divine once again displayed the Power Upanishad Formation of ancient martial arts that appeared when he learned the Six Paths with a spin from beneath his feet.</p><p>With a smile, he skipped over the explanation part he liked the least and forcefully lifted his arms, shouting:</p><p>“Four Sacrifice·Sacrifice Body!”</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>In an instant, The Divine’s body seemed to be ignited by an invisible flame, burning fiercely.</p><p>From foot, to knee, to groin, to abdomen, to hand, to chest, to shoulder, to head…</p><p>Everything, disappeared rapidly!</p><p>A public sacrifice!</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>Not only was Yue Gongli stunned.</p><p>All the surrounding onlookers, clutching their jade scrolls and bamboo scrolls, were also stunned.</p><p>No, I didn’t even blink, did I?</p><p>Did I miss a step in between, how come I still didn’t understand, and you’ve already started the sacrifice?</p><p>Didn’t we just talk about “rules”…</p><p>As this thought flashed by, The Divine’s body had already been completely abandoned by him for some other power and soon after, another voice came from the void:</p><p>“Four Sacrifice·Discarding Spirit!”</p><p>Right away, everyone without exception, started using their soul techniques.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, even more so, saw The Divine’s soul body quickly “self-burn” in a similar manner, using his Phantom Sword Technique, the small dark sword in his eyes outlined this clearly.</p><p>It was terrifying!</p><p>It’s a complete abandonment, without any reluctance!</p><p>Like being hit by the Passive Fist, then being shot by the Disillusionment Finger, at this moment The Divine, body and soul together, died very straightforwardly before everyone’s eyes!</p><p>“Is that it?”</p><p>“This is some evil technique, isn’t it!”</p><p>“I quit learning, let whoever wants to learn this ancient Four Scarifice do it!”</p><p>Countless people dropped the jade scrolls and bamboo slips they were holding.</p><p>It indeed appeared to be no different from sacrificing oneself.</p><p>The Divine had said they would die, and at first, everyone was somewhat skeptical, at least harboring the thought, “If I go up, I definitely won’t die.” But now it seemed…</p><p>He was being way too cautious with his words, wasn’t he? This wasn’t just “might die”; this was clearly “suicide”!</p><p>“Four Sacrifice·Sacrifice Intent!”</p><p>By then, the voice had become extremely feeble.</p><p>Only a few who had cultivated their will to a high degree could perceive The Divine’s intangible and abstract will, which was consequently discarded.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had activated Falling Flower World, wielding Swordless Sword Form, switching between the states of reality and nothingness, and only then witnessed this scene.</p><p>He was still pondering whether he should learn this “Four Sacrifice” or not when…</p><p>“…”</p><p>Suddenly, there was thunder in the silence.</p><p>Ahead, divine light descended, guiding a blurry figure to the Feather Ascension Upper Realm—the Eighteen Heavens!</p><p>Everyone in the Arena saw it.</p><p>Yet, clutching their jade scrolls and bamboo slips, they all were blank for a moment, feeling as if something had vanished.</p><p>“Who stole my memory!”</p><p>From behind, a cry of horror rose sharply.</p><p>When people looked back, they saw an Elder pointing at the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar, pointing at the nearby battlefield…</p><p>“Someone’s there!”</p><p>“Just now, someone was attacking that Ancestral Tree!”</p><p>“Why can’t I remember it, and this pillar, we’re gathered around here because someone was talking…”</p><p>He suddenly stopped, looking at the blank jade scroll in his hand as if he had seen a ghost, his pupils contracting sharply:</p><p>“Empty!”</p><p>“I clearly remembered writing something just now…”</p><p>Yue Gongli suddenly felt a chill at the back of his head too, furrowing his brows in thought, also unable to recall what had just happened.</p><p>All the jade scrolls and bamboo slips were blank.</p><p>Everyone’s memory seemed to have been robbed of a segment.</p><p>Only he, staring at the ancient bamboo slip in his hand inscribed with sixteen archaic characters preserved by a special power, was lost in thought:</p><p>“Body, Spirit, and Will, all four abandoned. (Little Turtle)”</p><p>“In the midst of Taoization, Returning to its Origins. (Little Goldfish)”</p><p>What am I remembering?</p><p>Sizzle! Are these two little animals drawn here also necessary?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou froze too, staring in the direction where there was no one in front of him, forgetting what he had just been doing.</p><p>After a long silence, he raised his head, about to curse his mother.</p><p>Suddenly, he realized that in the place of Feather Ascension Upper Realm, where everyone had been looking, there clearly was a figure crouching on the ground, yet unnoticed by anyone.</p><p>“Brother Anxiety?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou questioned as he took a step forward.</p><p>Yue Gongli’s body shuddered, and he quickly rubbed his eyes, looking in the direction Xu Xiaoshou was facing.</p><p>No one!</p><p>Damnable, damnable, damnable…</p><p>Why can’t I still see it?</p><p>Kong Yuhen! Brother Anxiety is Kong Yuhen, right, I remember traveling with him for a while!</p><p>Yue Gongli felt irritated, and everyone was creeped out.</p><p>Losing memory was terrifying enough, and now Lord Shou was talking excitedly to a “person” who didn’t exist:</p><p>“How are you here? Tell me, what just happened?”</p><p>The rustle of the wind replied.</p><p>“Me? What Sacrifice? And what is this Four Sacrifice?”</p><p>The whisper of fear spread.</p><p>“No way, are you saying he ascended to the Upper Realm? The one who saw through my Super Taoization? Then, doesn’t that mean he could meet Ran Ming?”</p><p>Huh… Everyone’s memory flickered with the figure of the person who just succeeded in ascension, feeling this place suddenly became all the more terrifying.</p><p>“I’m feeling a bit uncomfortable, I’ll leave first.”</p><p>“The spiritual medicine in my valley has matured, I’ll go pick some.”</p><p>“If you all are leaving, then the old man will too.”</p><p>“Communication bead, shouldn’t we also…?”</p><p>“Would you shut up already!” Yue Gongli snapped back irritably, as if he had remembered something else, looked around in alarm and asked:</p><p>“Where’s Huang Quan?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
