Why isn’t he using it?”</p><p>Bai Zhou suddenly had a moment of enlightenment and exclaimed in horror:</p><p>“Could it be that the Moment of Enlightenment has drained him, and he is actually weak on the inside? Was his earlier unbeatable facade all an act?”</p><p>With this outburst, both Elder Sang and Water Ghost changed their expressions.</p><p>Could it be!</p><p>It was indeed possible!</p><p>“That Xu Xiaoshou… isn’t he…”</p><p>…</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is doomed!”</p><p>Compared to the momentary panic of the Saint Servant’s side.</p><p>The Twelve Holy Lords, who had already retreated to various places and were watching the battle with their saint’s will, were all delighted.</p><p>“He’s definitely dead, I told you!”</p><p>“Daring to attack War Saint Taizai’s lady, upon his wrath, heaven and earth would change color. How could he dare?”</p><p>“Is God of War’s power a joke to you? It’s a power of the ancestral source that grows stronger and more valiant with battle, born for war!”</p><p>“Die!!!”</p><p>…</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The halberd was as heavy as a mountain, the dragon’s roar insane.</p><p>Before even touching the tip of the Dragon Painting Spear, the Berserk Giant felt a sharp pain in his arms that were blocking in front.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Feast could no longer swallow the excess ancestral source power and burst for the first time.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The Close-bounds Force Field with its myriad Sharpness blades was sliced open by the electric-like surging God of War’s power, as futile as an ant trying to shake a tree.</p><p>“Bang bang bang…”</p><p>The Exploding Posture was blasted to pieces.</p><p>The Life Upanishad was chopped to darkness.</p><p>As the heavy Dragon Painting Spear broke through all barriers and finally fell upon the Berserk Giant transformed into Acalanātha, Xu Xiaoshou felt his head was about to split open.</p><p>“Crack—”</p><p>Acalanātha withstood only for a moment before exploding, and Xu Xiaoshou was blasted deep into the earth, his body bursting with blood.</p><p>But War Saint Taizai Ci, with red eyes of madness, was able to forcefully receive the backlash of that strike.</p><p>He only staggered slightly, and his thousand-foot stature, inheriting the force, relentlessly brought down the halberd upon the Berserk Giant below, carrying intense hatred and vengeance.</p><p>“For me, die!!!”</p><p>Bang—</p><p>A thunderclap on level ground.</p><p>The Dragon Painting Spear split the earth, black lightning severing the golden light.</p><p>The arms of the Berserk Giant shattered at the sound, his body cracked open with fissures, and after a brief standoff with the great halberd…</p><p>“Bang bang bang…”</p><p>He exploded into pieces.</p><p>And was swept away by the Dragon Painting Spear, cut into dust, gone without a trace.</p><p>“Shah…”</p><p>The dust settled.</p><p>The world finally returned to deathly silence.</p><p>The great halberd withdrew and slanted behind, War Saint Taizai Ci let out a long howl, his voice echoing in all four corners of the world, exuberant and dripping with satisfaction,</p><p>“I am the Northern Region War Saint Taizai Ci, what boldness possesses a mere mortal to defy their superior!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Good!!!”</p><p>Having witnessed this scene, the Twelve Saints felt their blood rushing to their heads, eyes red and bulging, unable to resist smashing their fists into the air several times, utterly exhilarated.</p><p>“Lord Shou? A mere waste!”</p><p>“With War Saint Taizai in the lead, who dares to be so presumptuous?”</p><p>“The Northern Region War Saint, that is the Northern Region War Saint! How could you dare, Xu Xiaoshou, how could you?!”</p><p>“No matter what you try, no matter how you maneuver, a single strike from me will sever you. What can you do? You only have one path to death!”</p><p>“I just knew it, I just knew it… Hahaha, that kid couldn’t even take a single blow from War Saint Taizai Ci, how dare he provoke and agitate him, that’s the God of War! Other than smearing his face with blood, he couldn’t do anything; he’s truly a waste!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
