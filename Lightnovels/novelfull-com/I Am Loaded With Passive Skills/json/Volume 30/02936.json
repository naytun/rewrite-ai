He’d even hit him in the face.</p><p>But with the Void Giant Master present, it really wasn’t a good time to start a conflict with him. Should he let the Di Ying Holy Plant wear down the Void Giant Master’s temper first?</p><p>“Your Heavenly Ancestor body… the index finger, how did you acquire it?” Xu Xiaoshou lowered his fist.</p><p>Yue Gongli’s eyes shifted.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his fist again, eager to try.</p><p>In a closed space, the fist of a physique cultivator, and one who sometimes goes into a frenzy at that, was quite intimidating!</p><p>Yue Gongli immediately cut off any bluffing and sincerely said, “Abyss Island.”</p><p>“Heavenly Ancestor Legacy?” Xu Xiaoshou was surprised.</p><p>He remembered that the first step to the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy seemed to be achieved only by himself, Bazhun’an, and Bei Huai, with no mention of Yue Gongli?</p><p>And, he had already obtained the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy; it certainly did not come with an express delivery of a Heavenly Ancestor’s finger, did it?</p><p>“It’s not.”</p><p>Yue Gongli, knowing that he had to speak since he couldn’t possibly fool Xu Xiaoshou, straightforwardly said: “It’s Sleeping Valley.”</p><p>“I’ve been to Abyss Island, as an envoy, to help suppress the unrest in the Inner Island… At that time, Abyss Island had not yet fallen into your hands, Saint Servants’.”</p><p>“Since I was there, I didn’t bother to interfere with their serious affairs. I also took the opportunity to tour the Outer Island. What I visited was Sleeping Valley.”</p><p>Sleeping Valley?</p><p>Where is that?</p><p>Abyss Island is too big; Xu Xiaoshou hadn’t finished touring all nine of the extreme grounds and almost couldn’t remember what this place was.</p><p>Yue Gongli said, “That place is filled with slumbering Stone Giants, which are actually remnants of the Heavenly Ancestor’s divinity. When I went there and obtained the Heavenly Ancestor index finger, it stirred the Stone Giants. I was chased across half of Abyss Island and almost lost my life.”</p><p>With this description, Xu Xiaoshou remembered.</p><p>Wasn’t this the script that Big Mouth Xiao and Dean Ye got? When they entered the Arena to fight Jiang Buyi, they brought many Stone Giants with them.</p><p>But…</p><p>It seemed that it was Xiao Kongtong who brought out the Stone Giants.</p><p>He also visited Sleeping Valley. If there was a Heavenly Ancestor’s index finger there, did he obtain it as well?</p><p>He had never heard about it.</p><p>It seemed he only got a demi-saint person.</p><p>Yue Gongli seemed to know what Xu Xiaoshou was thinking and said with a smile, “There couldn’t be a second finger. Divine Shedding is incredibly rare; the presence of such a thing in Sleeping Valley is perhaps due to the aftermath of the Divine Battle between the gods and demons.”</p><p>The Divine Battle?</p><p>The war between the Heavenly Ancestor and the Demon God?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had heard the legends of Abyss Island.</p><p>The pure land under the Heavenly Ancestor’s rule was invaded by the Demon God, causing members of the Void Race, including Void Attendants, Void Generals, to die in succession.</p><p>Was this legend true?</p><p>He recalled once more the fragmented images of the divine battle he had seen in his mind upon entering the Ran Ming ruins…</p><p>The Moon Fox seemed to possess riches beyond mere material wealth.</p><p>As a successor of the Holy Emperor, he had a deeper understanding of these secrets.</p><p>And in the five regions, due to the Holy Emperor’s power of oblivion, these things were not even recorded!</p><p>“Divine Shedding?” Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze flickered over.</p><p>Yue Gongli naturally knew of such barbaric ignorance and began to explain:</p><p>“Those who seal their Godhood and claim Ancestral God status, ascend through the Thirty Three Heavens of the Divine Realm. They cannot take anything mundane with them, including their sacred bodies from before their ascension.”</p><p>“The body they shed, which is part divine and part saint, during the transition from Saint to Godhood, we call ‘Divine Shedding’.”</p><p>Yue Gongli pointed outside the coffin: “The Heavenly Ancestor, after sealing his Godhood and before ascending to the Divine Realm, this finger represents a portion of his power during that time.”</p><p>Hisss!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou drew in a sharp breath.</p><p>That’s a lot of information.</p><p>Is this something I’m supposed to hear, something you can actually tell me?</p><p>Shouldn’t this information come from Bazhun’an, informing me properly?</p><p>“Are you fooling me?” Xu Xiaoshou was somewhat distrustful of the fox now.</p><p>Yue Gongli shook his head: “To the common man, these are secrets, known yet bound to be forgotten; you are different, you will eventually know.”</p><p>The sounds of intense explosions continued from outside the coffin.</p><p>Inside the coffin, a remarkable heart-to-heart communication was underway:</p><p>“Not everyone yearns to seal their Godhood and claim Ancestral God status.”</p><p>“Nor does everyone have the desire and the ability to resist the Five Great Holy Emperors after learning the secrets of claiming Godhood and Ancestral God status.”</p><p>“Bazhun’an is an exception.”</p><p>Yue Gongli looked at the thoughtful young man and slowly said, “You have a choice.”</p><p>A choice?</p><p>What choice?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was about to speak, but then hesitated.</p><p>He seemed to understand the implication of Yue Gongli’s words without needing to ask.</p><p>Leaving behind even the “Divine Shedding” implies that after sealing their Godhood, one really can’t take anything away.</p><p>The Feather Ascension Divine Realm, is that truly the best choice?</p><p>So…</p><p>The God of Sword, Gu Louying, who had experienced the 21 Famed Swords and carried the twelve sabers from the sword tower,</p><p>In the end, also left behind a building, a painting, a shadow, alone and adrift, vanishing into the distance?</p><p>Is that the true reason behind the saying ‘generation after generation there are famed swords, but the famed sword has no permanent master’?</p><p>If even the Sword God couldn’t transcend, and I were to claim my Godhood…</p><p>A myriad of attachments flashed through Xu Xiaoshou’s mind in an instant: people, trees, cats, swords, and…</p><p>Nothing is brought at birth, nothing can be taken at death.</p><p>Claiming Godhood and Ancestral God status, is it the same?</p><p>For a moment, he felt an emptiness in his heart, as if after striving for so long, he was suddenly informed that the end was a bottomless abyss.</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
