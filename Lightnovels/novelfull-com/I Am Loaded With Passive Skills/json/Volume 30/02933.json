Did it really need to resort to quantity over quality to obliterate the golden light?</p><p>What is this thing?</p><p>Is Xu Xiaoshou really still human?</p><p>With this golden stuff, Dao Xuanji has to deal with him?</p><p>Could Xu Xiaoshou’s defense be broken if she kept attacking him for three days and three nights without moving?</p><p>She could only break defense on the spot!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>After a brief moment, the golden light was broken through.</p><p>As the Ultimate Giant shook violently, Yue Gongli, hidden in the Yin Coffin, also heard a scream of unparalleled shrillness echoing from the end of the world:</p><p>“Ssss!!!”</p><p>The scream, like the cry of a cat and the wailing of a ghost, echoed like a plague of the mind, sweeping through everything.</p><p>A scream from the Di Ying Holy Plant?</p><p>Was it attacked?</p><p>Who attacked it?</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>In the Yin Coffin, before Yue Gongli could fully understand, his head suddenly contorted and twisted grotesquely, and he vomited blood.</p><p>Just by hearing it from afar, his whole body convulsed like that of a mad dog, and a dense aura of the Evil God’s Energy emanated from him.</p><p>That evil energy was quickly reabsorbed into his body.</p><p>Yue Gongli returned to normal and opened his eyes inside the coffin.</p><p>The violent mixing of the powers of the Holy Ancestor, Heavenly Ancestor, and evil god flickered in his eyes but quickly subsided.</p><p>After a short while, he curled up his legs, held his knees with one hand, and covered his mouth with the other hand, letting out a cry of frightened disbelief:</p><p>“Lord Shou, what is this sound? I’m scared…”</p><p>…</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Asked a question, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>The Information Bar notifications popped up steadily, even if Acalanātha’s defense was broken, Xu Xiaoshou, as the Ultimate Giant, had no issues, demonstrating incredibly strong resistance.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Xu Xiaoshou effortlessly calmed the surge of the evil god aura within him, then said calmly:</p><p>“That is the sound of one who is about to die, yet remains unaware of it.”</p><p>In the Yin Coffin, Yue Gongli’s eyes lit up, and he swung his fist vigorously:</p><p>“So arrogant!”</p><p>“Youth should be arrogant!”</p><p>“Go for it, Lord Shou! If I were thirty years younger and without the nuisance of the power of the ancestral source, I would definitely stand shoulder to shoulder with you… fight… Hey, what the…?”</p><p>Yue Gongli’s speech was cut short as he realized that the Yin Coffin was taking off.</p><p>A probe with his saint’s will revealed that the Ultimate Giant had not pursued the attack, seizing the opportunity to attack the main body of the Di Ying Holy Plant.</p><p>Instead, it had grasped the coffin that sheltered him and hefted it up with two fingers that were bigger than the Heavenly Pillar!</p><p>Yue Gongli’s Adam’s apple bobbed, “Lord Shou, what do you mean by this?”</p><p>“I told you, it’s the sound of one who is about to die, yet remains unaware.”</p><p>As the thunderous voice settled, Yue Gongli felt the entire Yin Coffin deforming, grotesquely deforming!</p><p>The coffin was being assaulted by colossal forces from both ends, more than it could withstand.</p><p>The top of the coffin bulged upward, while the bottom also bulged downward.</p><p>At this moment, the Yin Coffin, one of the Great Psionic Weapons, seemed as if it was about to be crushed by the two fingers of the Ultimate Giant!</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>“No, you can’t, you mustn’t! Stop it!”</p><p>Yue Gongli, as if he had just sat down on a hot stove, leaped up from the searing pain in his tender parts and began running back and forth inside the coffin:</p><p>“Don’t do this, Lord Shou, attack her, why are you squashing my coffin?”</p><p>“I’m your friend, not your enemy, our enemy is the Di Ying Saint… Stop, stop!”</p><p>“Lord Shou I beg you, don’t crush my coffin, something terrible will happen! I’m not lying to you! Stop!”</p><p>Something terrible happening?</p><p>What could be more terrifying than an Ultimate Giant not taking your bait, not being deceived, and instead deciding to crush your turtle shell?</p><p>“I will uproot the Di Ying Holy Plant.”</p><p>“And before that, you will exit the ruins first.”</p><p>The fingers of the Ultimate Giant pressed harder.</p><p>Embodying the Life Upanishad and the Body of Devour, drawing vitality from nature, the energy was nearly endless.</p><p>The power, likewise, flowed without interruption.</p><p>The Ultimate Giant had truly achieved the freedom to turn on and off at will, and to act utterly mad in between!</p><p>“Ssss!!!”</p><p>In the darkness, another piercing scream arose.</p><p>In the distance, the sound of something tearing through the sky like thunder suggested an unbelievable, massive monster was rapidly approaching.</p><p>Clearly, the Di Ying Holy Plant was enraged, coming angrily to strike.</p><p>Yet at this moment, the Ultimate Giant ignored the approaching threat from behind and still targeted the Yin Coffin, the “teammate” who was supposed to have a win-win cooperation with him.</p><p>“Stop it!”</p><p>Yue Gongli finally started to scream, “Let’s cooperate, let’s not hurt each other anymore… I can fight! I really can fight!”</p><p>“Too late.”</p><p>“I alone can fight just as well.”</p><p>Golden light began to emerge from the fingertips of the Ultimate Giant, and being unable to crush the coffin with mere brute strength, it utilized the Exploding Posture.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Instantly, the talisman paper on the Yin Coffin shattered into dozens of pieces.</p><p>The fear in Yue Gongli’s scream intensified, “Don’t do it, someone will die, let’s cooperate! I’ll tell you first, there’s a problem at the Ran Ming ruins, people are dying right now!”</p><p>“That’s perfect.”</p><p>Crack, crack, crack, crack…</p><p>Dozens more talisman papers were shattered.</p><p>Yue Gongli was dumbfounded, clutching his head and repeatedly sitting up and lying down in the coffin.</p><p>You don’t believe me?</p><p>How can you not believe me?</p><p>He had never heard the story of “The Boy Who Cried Wolf,” but at this moment Yue Gongli bitterly understood its moral.</p><p>“I’m really not joking!”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>4 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p><p>4</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
