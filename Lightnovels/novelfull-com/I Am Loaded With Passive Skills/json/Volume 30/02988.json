Wasn’t he only involved in Fen Qin after he left the Holy Palace?”</p><p>To this, the Water Ghost chuckled, “There’s no instant success; he wasn’t among the Ten High Nobles, only when things are ripe.”</p><p>After a pause, the Water Ghost murmured slightly anxiously to himself, “This is exactly why I only chose to maintain an information operation in one city.”</p><p>So you only set up Night Cat, just handling the intelligence work for Dongtianwang City, right?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rolled his eyes secretly, clearly not appreciating Palace Master Bai Zhou of the First Pavilion in the Sky being so unambitious.</p><p>Elder Sang is good!</p><p>Elder Sang is more professional.</p><p>You, Water Ghost, should learn from Elder Sang, gain some experience, and be a competent Chief Elder.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>With the successful sanctification unfolding here, soon not far away, a powerful and fierce wave of Holy Power also surged.</p><p>Just from the aura, it seemed not much weaker than the Upanishad demi-saint, Elder Sang.</p><p>Everyone’s gaze simultaneously turned toward the distance, creating more wonder.</p><p>“He succeeded too.”</p><p>“It’s Palace Master Bai Zhou!”</p><p>“Great, now we have two more demi-saint level combat strengths.”</p><p>“Ah, if only I wasn’t lacking in talent, I’d also like to be sanctified, to ease Lord Shou’s worries.”</p><p>“Forget it, you, shut up; Lord Shou is not from the Holy Divine Palace, he might actually grant you a semi-saint position.”</p><p>“Damn, that’s true, I didn’t say anything…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had mixed feelings.</p><p>He didn’t know whether allowing Bai Zhou to be sanctified was the best choice.</p><p>After all, the alliance agreement between Xu Yue Grey Palace and the First Pavilion in the Sky could hardly even be called an agreement, just a verbal commitment.</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>In his mind, Greedy the Cat Spirit called out softly, indicating to his owner not to worry, as Palace Master Bai Zhou was not likely to break his promise.</p><p>Supposedly… Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit was young during its time in Xu Yue Grey Palace; it hadn’t met Bai Zhou many times and, after following him, its connection with its maternal home faded.</p><p>Its impression of Bai Zhou was still good, encompassing qualities like being hearty, generous, and somewhat heroic.</p><p>The rest was just fear.</p><p>Even fearing the association to the same extent, including the fear of “alcohol” from drinking.</p><p>As for why a saint beast felt such profound fear for Palace Master Bai Zhou, whom it had hardly met a few times…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
