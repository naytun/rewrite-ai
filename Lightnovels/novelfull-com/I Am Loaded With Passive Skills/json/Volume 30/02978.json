Whoosh!</p><p>Two sword lights streaked across the distant sky.</p><p>The Fourth Sword and the Flame Python pinned them down.</p><p>Pierced through the head and cracked through the heart by the famed swords enhanced by sword cognition, these higher void individuals died instantly.</p><p>“What is this thing!”</p><p>The first higher void, who was beheaded, was so terrified he felt his gallbladder and liver split, his soul body turned into a streak of dark light, abandoning his physique to escape using the Blank Escape.</p><p>“Return.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou brought his two fingers together and drew them upwards.</p><p>In the void where the sword cognition intercrossed, as the Fourth Sword and the Flame Python returned, they were accompanied by the manifestation of several ghost swords and Mo Swords, which scoured the dark soul shadow to pieces, until nothing but miserable cries remained.</p><p>Sizzle! Sizzle!</p><p>The two swords returned, resting at his waist.</p><p>The demonic aura and infernal white flame unfurled like wings on either side; the nameless sword shed its concealed subtlety, showcasing all the Sharpness of an unsheathed blade, adding splendor to the dark-clad figure standing midair.</p><p>Only then did Xu Xiaoshou lower his gaze towards the ground.</p><p>The six demi-saints, each positioned in accordance with the Hexagram, one with a bowed back carrying a turtle shell, one with red strings around his waist, one with a hand full of talisman papers, one picking leaves off flying flowers, one draped with a heavy sword, one pressing his lips together without a word.</p><p>This moment, they had all stood up in shock, their faces filled with surprise, sentiment, sighs, or admiration… Yet, there was no trace of fear.</p><p>“Excellent sword! Zong Jianfeng, how do you like this sword?”</p><p>“So you are the famous Xu Xiaoshou known throughout the five regions, with unmatched skill in sword, spirits, and body, the Saint Servant Lord Shou who had produced thousands of children?”</p><p>“We’ve heard that one’s reputation cannot match meeting face to face. Just before, we were discussing how that Demi-Saint’s thought incarnation vanished on its own.”</p><p>“Young friend seems not to have reached demi-saint level? How strange, how did you manage that with the Body of Consciousness just now?”</p><p>“Are you married yet?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou silently swept over these six old men, seriously scrutinizing each demi-saint for the first time.</p><p>His instincts told him they were no Jiang Buyis, each a killer through and through.</p><p>But, so what?</p><p>He squinted slightly, slanted his sword, and said indifferently,</p><p>“I have but one thing to say.”</p><p>“Leave now, and I shall not pursue the matter further!”</p><p>Iron Turtle, Red String Elder, Fu Jiu, Ye Xiao, Zong Jianfeng, Verbal Spiritual Spell, their gazes met for a moment.</p><p>The hunchbacked old man with a turtle shell waved his hand and spoke, “Young friend, ever heard of the Central Hexagram Saint?”</p><p>Without waiting for a response, the old man with red strings around his waist who had inquired about Xu Xiaoshou’s marital status, and who appeared kind and compassionate, continued with a smile,</p><p>“The six of us are clanless, wandering the world our entire lives, only doing menial and dirty work for the Holy Divine Palace.”</p><p>“We’ve killed those of higher void and even demi-saints. Being called by an Invitation to Saint to kill someone at the Cutting Path Stage is indeed rare.”</p><p>“Lord Ai Cangsheng said you were no ordinary person and even handed us a heap of intelligence, warning us to be cautious of you.”</p><p>“At the time, we old guys were thinking that there would never come a day when all six of us would be needed at once; but when the day did arrive…”</p><p>He shrugged his shoulders, tying knots with the red string, and said with a wry smile,</p><p>“Either live, or die; it seems indeed there’s no real need for further words, wouldn’t you agree, young friend?”</p><p>Killers of demi-saint level nurtured by the Holy Divine Palace, huh?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyebrows twitched slightly, realizing these six old men were likely never going to be persuaded by words or turned to his side.</p><p>At this moment…</p><p>As the Red String Elder sighed, pulling the tied end of the string tight then yanking it back without further words,</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had absolutely no warning of a covert attack, nor did he feel any killing intent directed at him.</p><p>In that instant, he felt a tight sensation around his waist; out of nowhere, a sharp red string had appeared.</p><p>The string was wrapped around his own body, but the other end was in the hands of the Red String Elder. With every pull, the string tightened, nearly severing his body in two.</p><p>Wrong!</p><p>It wasn’t his body it was binding and attacking, it was his soul!</p><p>“Sizzle—”</p><p>With a tearing sound, Xu Xiaoshou clearly saw a black line opening on his waist, and his soul body writhed in pain that contorted his face.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The Red String Elder flicked his finger as if pulling a great bull, but this time he couldn’t break the enemy’s soul body no matter what.</p><p>He felt a sudden sinking in his heart and urgently called for help,</p><p>“Do something, all of you!”</p><p>Buzz.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took action.</p><p>The Way of the Sword Disc spun beneath his feet; only Hidden Bitter in his hand, he phased into nothingness.</p><p>Swordless Sword Technique, Swordless Sword Form!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
