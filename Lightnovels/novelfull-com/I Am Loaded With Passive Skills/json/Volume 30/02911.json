The human heart can be hurt, even die.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng said, “Nangong Has Technique, Situ Yongren, don’t you think these names all sound very much like Dao Qiongcang?”</p><p>“They, all of them, are Hallmaster Dao?” Xi finally regained his composure, disbelief in his eyes. That Divine Sect as well…</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>Suddenly there are so many Divine Sorcerers in the Southern Region…</p><p>“Pff…cough, cough!”</p><p>Xi suddenly choked on his own saliva. “Sorry!”</p><p>No way, not just one-man Path Division, surely there couldn’t be a one-man Southern Region too?</p><p>Xi felt a chill run down the back of his neck.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao is gone.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao is omnipresent.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao is more terrifying than a nightmare!</p><p>He looked towards Emperor Cang Sheng, who also flashed a hint of confusion in his eyes, murmuring to himself,</p><p>“So easily deciphered by us, could he still be Dao Qiongcang?”</p><p>Crack—</p><p>Xi petrified on the spot, utterly confused.</p><p>Yes, even I can see through Hallmaster Dao…</p><p>No, what am I thinking, what right do I have?</p><p>“It must be an illusion,” Xi asserted confidently.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng did not respond, turning his head and giving him a fleeting glance.</p><p>“I take back my words!” Xi collapsed!</p><p>It’s over!</p><p>Last night, in my dreams, it wasn’t just Xu Xiaoshou. I had to add Hallmaster Dao too!</p><p>Situ Yongren? Nangong technique? Divine Sect? Path Division, Southern Region, Dao Qiongcang… etc., Lord Cangsheng staying here to guard the sacred mountain, could it be possible that…</p><p>“Stop thinking about it.”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng looked at the young man whose eyes had suddenly acquired many red veins: “Check into the Divine Sect, regardless of the result… No, you don’t need to produce results. Hand over all the findings to me.”</p><p>“Yes…”</p><p>Xi hadn’t done anything yet but was already somewhat mentally exhausted.</p><p>If that person was orchestrating everything, does it matter what the Transformation Division finds?</p><p>What you get is only what he wants you to see…</p><p>Xi grabbed his head.</p><p>Damn!</p><p>I’m losing hair again!</p><p>He looked up anxiously: “So we have to not only contend with Xu Xiaoshou but also confront Hallmaster Dao head-on?” Ah! Just kill me!</p><p>It wasn’t entirely impossible… Ai Cangsheng pondered for a moment, a mysterious smile playing around his lips:</p><p>“If we must fight.”</p><p>Xi almost collapsed onto the ground.</p><p>Stop kidding. You couldn’t possibly be Hallmaster Dao too!</p><p>“Or maybe we shouldn’t investigate?” Xi Cheng earnestly suggested, “Hallmaster Dao once told me that if there’s a sealed box, and you don’t know whether it’s dangerous inside, if you don’t open it, the probability is fifty-fifty. But if you do open it…”</p><p>“It must ultimately be opened.”</p><p>“But by not touching it, at least temporarily, we are not in danger… We can’t possibly think about how to deal with Hallmaster Dao while facing Xu Xiaoshou at the same time, can we? We don’t have the energy for that, Lord Cangsheng!”</p><p>“But we are the Holy Divine Palace.”</p><p>Xi was stunned, unable to say another word, staring blankly at Lord Cang Sheng.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng looked into the sky, across the five regions, and continued speaking calmly:</p><p>“You are a Saint Servant, you can choose not to open the box from Xu Yue Grey Palace, not to open Yama’s box, not to open other boxes you don’t want to touch or face.”</p><p>“You can choose to do things you’re certain of, you open just Abyss Island, just Ran Ming ruins, only benefitting, not suffering the consequences.”</p><p>“But as the Holy Divine Palace, you must be prepared to set in motion everything with a single action.”</p><p>“What you should be considering, is not avoiding the dark boxes you don’t want to open but instead actively touching all, even if opening the box would bite off your hand.”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng said this, then turned his gaze, looking at the young man in front of him:</p><p>“You say, if the box isn’t opened, the probability is fifty-fifty.”</p><p>“Yet you’re unwilling to consider, whether Xu Xiaoshou might emerge from the ruins, step onto the sacred mountain just as Dao Qiongcang opportunely leads the Divine Sect to lend a helping hand.”</p><p>“You’d rather deceive yourself than open the box; it’s not the box in front of you, it’s the Cage Theory trapping you.”</p><p>Xi’s body shook, his palms sweaty.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng paused, glanced toward the distance, and said softly:</p><p>“Indeed, the words ‘Dao Qiongcang’ carry heavy weight; if possible, nobody would want to confront it, especially those of us who have experienced his prowess.”</p><p>“But even though I ‘give up swordsmanship’, I know…”</p><p>“The Heart Sword Technique does not cultivate for the Present Gods and Buddhas, but for a vision devoid of Gods and Buddhas.”</p><p>Xi’s body shook, his hands clenched tight, full of sweat.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng didn’t continue.</p><p>However, he knew that having followed Hallmaster Dao for a while, he had somehow also planted seeds of evil within himself!</p><p>“Thank you, Lord Cangsheng, for your guidance.” Xi was genuinely grateful but immediately darkened thinking about directly facing Saint Servants and Hallmaster Dao next.</p><p>“Divine Sect, the Transformation Division will thoroughly investigate to the end!” Xi requested, “But what about the God Executioner’s Ruins?”</p><p>“Issue an ‘Invitation to Saint’!”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng waved his hand, “All the demi-saints that can be mobilized, toss them into the Ran Ming ruins. We cannot sit idly by; whoever can kick him out of the Ran Ming ruins, that person will be the hero.”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
