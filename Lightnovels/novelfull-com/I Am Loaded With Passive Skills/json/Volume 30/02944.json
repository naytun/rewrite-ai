Even this bit of power from the evil god affects you?”</p><p>The Six Marrow Corpse King made a confused “ho” sound, as if it had just remembered something, and a purely serene Power of the Holy Ancestor emerged from its body.</p><p>Immediately, the entire coffin lit up, bright and clear as a church.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded.</p><p>It’s just a corpse, how can you be so holy?</p><p>In this broken coffin, there’s not a single idle person, no, not even an idle corpse.</p><p>Despite his snide thoughts, he seemed to understand that there was a reason the seemingly weaker Six Marrow Corpse King had survived while even the Void Giant Master had fallen to the attacks of the Di Ying Holy Plant.</p><p>This fellow might be foolish, but the quality and quantity of the ancestral source power within him were actually no weaker than that of the Void Giant Master.</p><p>And it has one point stronger than the Void Giant Master—the intelligence!</p><p>“This Moon Fox…”</p><p>“Stop being cautious of me!” Yue Gongli leaned forward, fully controlling the Yin Coffin, and seemed to glimpse into Xu Xiaoshou’s mind, pointedly nodding his chin, “Take a look at your Saint Servant’s people!”</p><p>Saint Servant?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked up towards the other side.</p><p>There, in the distance, a tiny figure the size of a grain of rice, carrying the blood tree and wielding an axe, was happily chopping the life-threatening branches of the Di Ying Holy Plant.</p><p>His tree chopping seemed to include extra attack power, and he was doing it joyfully.</p><p>Around him, hazy mist enveloped, protecting and guarding him while preventing any covert attacks.</p><p>To be paired in such a way, work was not tiring.</p><p>“Cen Qiaofu? Water Ghost?”</p><p>Joy appeared in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes as he urged the driver, “Go over there, go over there!”</p><p>Yue Gongli said nothing, just turned his head back silently and gave him a glance.</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eagerness was doused with cold water.</p><p>Right, this coffin still belongs to Yue Gongli, and it was already outrageous for him to force his way onboard.</p><p>The cunning Moon Fox, how could she possibly let the Water Ghost and Cen Qiaofu, two demi-saints, come aboard?</p><p>That would not just be overshadowing the host.</p><p>In time, even taking over the driver’s seat was possible!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>With some experience now, Yue Gongli steered the Yin Coffin in the opposite direction, being blasted away, distancing from the Saint Servant.</p><p>Clearly…</p><p>After encountering two groups of living beings, Yue Gongli could hardly smile.</p><p>It seemed he also realized that now on the Ancestral God Ranking, other than his Holy Divine Palace, the rest could be said to be enemies.</p><p>Even looking over the entirety of the Divine Relics, the Holy Divine Palace might still seem to dominate alone, but underneath, it was all dark factions plotting a rebellion.</p><p>The once cooperative Holy Palace that could form a strategic corner with them, with Wei An leaving earlier, had also ceased to be.</p><p>The Holy Palace had retired early…</p><p>“He, Yue Gongli, alone, cannot support it all!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could naturally sense this point.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu had just been sanctified, his abilities were not fully clear, but the strength of the Water Ghost he knew well.</p><p>I can see him, he can’t see me?</p><p>Bullshit!</p><p>Though they couldn’t meet for the moment, it couldn’t stop him when he had a loud voice and could just shout:</p><p>“Pale purple…”</p><p>Gurgle!</p><p>Sure enough, even before he could finish speaking, the humidity in the void dramatically increased, and many water bubbles even emerged.</p><p>The Water Ghost, who was originally slacking off, treating the Old Woodcutter like an old donkey to use, thinking it’s better to mind his own business than to meddle, suddenly exerted force.</p><p>An endless mist came across the space along the Ancestor Tree Branch in an instant, climbing near the Yin Coffin, and then crept onto the human and corpse inside.</p><p>The Upanishad’s talent, ability, and brilliance, are things that even the darkness of the Di Ying Holy Plant cannot hide!</p><p>80%, 90%, is the difference between them big?</p><p>Big!</p><p>But not to the extent that they could be instantly obliterated like an ordinary demi-saint!</p><p>Suddenly, the interior of the Yin Coffin became damp.</p><p>The Six Marrow Corpse King watched as his body gradually swelled up with water, grabbed his head with both hands, and shook the water that had accumulated inside:</p><p>“Ho?”</p><p>Yue Gongli’s expression changed.</p><p>“Scram!”</p><p>With a snap, the entire Yin Coffin turned to ice.</p><p>The Six Marrow Corpse King was directly turned into an ice sculpture, with all the moisture completely drained out.</p><p>“Gurgle…”</p><p>The clothes in front of Xu Xiaoshou burst open.</p><p>His blood and water condensed to form half a figure, then surged to mold a vague head; the hollow half of a golden beast mask also appeared.</p><p>A huge hand formed of water vapor stretched out from Xu Xiaoshou’s shoulder, gently pushing on the half of the golden beast mask on the Water Ghost’s face, clearly communicating a sense of annoyance and loathing, yet it turned its head, staring at Xu Xiaoshou, and quickly spoke:</p><p>“The Old Woodcutter can’t hold on much longer.”</p><p>“The Yin Branch of the blood tree has side effects.”</p><p>“The situation with the Di Ying Holy Plant has changed, it has already exceeded the level of a normal Ancestor Tree, at least it’s a Holy Emperor person, but the power it shows…”</p><p>“I know all that,” Xu Xiaoshou interrupted.</p><p>“Then why did you call me over!” The Water Ghost exclaimed in anger.</p><p>“Don’t just watch, help out a bit, Cen Qiaofu is almost drained by you,” Xu Xiaoshou laughed, “Where’s my master?”</p><p>“Don’t know, haven’t seen him, he probably hasn’t met with an accident, or maybe he sensed the guidance and didn’t come in.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thoughtfully said to the water vapor face close in front of him, “Go find a woman, pale purple hair, good figure, looks about thirty or forty years old…”</p><p>“Palace Master Bai Zhou?”</p><p>“Ah right, you know her, that’s even better, although I don’t know where she is now, you can definitely find her…”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
