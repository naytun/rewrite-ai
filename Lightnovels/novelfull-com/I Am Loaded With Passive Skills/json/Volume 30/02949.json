Swept to pieces! The term “Overlord” was interpreted to the extreme!</p><p>The Di Ying Holy Plant was whipped into stupefaction.</p><p>It took a while to realize what had happened.</p><p>Did this human just sever most of her limbs?</p><p>“Sizzle—”</p><p>A harrowing scream barely escaped.</p><p>The Divine’s figure, however, had disappeared from the spot.</p><p>Immediately, Changyi’s pupils trembled greatly; he recognized this!</p><p>At some point in the past, he had personally experienced the incomprehensible speed of this man and the wave-like, unrelenting barrage of attacks.</p><p>Back then, he had only withstood one wave and then shattered.</p><p>“Split the Mountain.”</p><p>The human figure appeared above the Di Ying Holy Plant’s tree crown face, as huge as the sky and the earth.</p><p>Everyone had not yet reacted.</p><p>One strike of the Overlord, from top to bottom, swung with all his might.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>An explosive sound detonated within the divine palace.</p><p>The roots below the Di Ying Holy Plant, some broken, some connected, all pulsated outwards in unison.</p><p>Her tree crown dented inward.</p><p>Her tree trunk shrunk in height.</p><p>Her six tentacle-like branches covering her face squeezed to each side.</p><p>As another overwhelming shadow of a stick descended, splitting the sacred mountain, piercing through the main body of the Di Ying Holy Plant.</p><p>Everyone seemed to witness this spectacle:</p><p>The Ancestor Tree, the Di Ying Holy Plant, splitting in response to the force, dividing into two halves?</p><p>“Sizzle—”</p><p>The reality was not so severe.</p><p>But with this strike, the Di Ying Holy Plant exploded like a roach, spurting life fluids imbued with the power of the evil god in all directions.</p><p>“Ssss, ssss, ssss!!!”</p><p>She screamed in pain.</p><p>The six thickest branches that were her arms raised from her face, forcefully pushing away the Overlord, toppling The Divine away.</p><p>“Sizzle—”</p><p>A face without features on the tree crown emerged, showing nothing but intense fury, irritability, pain, and a destructive expression.</p><p>“Xu!”</p><p>Tree hands shot upwards.</p><p>While flinging the Overlord away, they also grabbed The Divine who followed the stick.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, the other five great tree hands climbed and clung on.</p><p>“Xu, xu, xu, xu, xu!”</p><p>For a moment, The Divine, in his human form, was firmly grasped by six huge tree hands, encased in mid-air.</p><p>Below, onlookers lifted their heads with expressions of shock.</p><p>Even though it wasn’t them being grabbed, everyone present already felt short of breath as if personally in that situation.</p><p>“Hum, hum, hum…”</p><p>The destructive lights of the ancestral source’s power mixed and tangled, as if an extremely compressed source seed was about to explode.</p><p>And then, the six great tree hands brutally caved inwards as if crushing a bean, squeezing all existence within, including The Divine and Overlord, compressing their space to zero in an instant.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The void exploded with a deafening blast.</p><p>All below clenched their teeth and grimaced, feeling a phantom pain in their hearts.</p><p>But that light, it was white light! Descending from the sky!</p><p>“Sss—”</p><p>As the explosion rang out, the Ancestor Trees cried out in pain again.</p><p>The wrap-around of The Divine by the six great tree bodies burst open with huge divine light, and from within the shell emerged a colossal bald head.</p><p>As his body extended out from the brilliant light, a deep, resonating hum that seemed to vibrate with heaven and earth arose in response to the light:</p><p>“Way of the Heavens!”</p><p>“I, along with the heavens, am colossal!”</p><p>A tiny body burst forth with the energy of heaven and earth.</p><p>Previously merely in the form of a human, The Divine, after the flash of white light, had transformed into something even larger than the Di Ying Holy Plant.</p><p>The Overlord he held in his hands had likewise increased to a matching size… Now, how could one discern any “plainness and lack of flair”?</p><p>This was clearly a god holding up the Heavenly Pillar!</p><p>When the Heavenly Pillar Overlord leaned to one side, The Divine stumbled to that side as well.</p><p>“Horizontal strike.”</p><p>The same attack, the same move.</p><p>The six great tree hands of the Ancestor Trees, repelled by The Divine of the Way of the Heavens, were wide open.</p><p>As the Heavenly Pillar Overlord swept across, the dark world of the Divine Court was divided by the white light, momentarily making heaven and earth distinct.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>The Divine Court fractured.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The Divine Court shattered.</p><p>“…”</p><p>The Di Ying Holy Plant of the Ancestor Trees couldn’t even scream before it was snapped in half at the waist.</p><p>Both the tree crown and the trunk rooted in the earth were ripped away by the tremendous force, flying from the Dark Divine Court to the Dark Forest, then from the Dark Forest towards the northern lands of the Divine Relics.</p><p>“Boom boom boom boom boom boom….”</p><p>The giant tree crossed mountains, passing over myriad bewildered beings of the higher void and demi-saints like a divine spectacle descending from the sky, tempting countless to pursue.</p><p>But before they could give chase, a white light flared up in the distance, and the Divine Relics finally experienced a Divine Descent.</p><p>“What is this…”</p><p>“What thing!”</p><p>Countless people looked up to the sky in astonishment.</p><p>But within the heaven and earth, a huge bald deity materialized out of thin air.</p><p>His head could touch the sky, his feet could support the earth, his face melancholy, his eyes harboring ferocity, and his whole body wrapped in an endless fierce aura, with each muscle exuding explosive power.</p><p>In his hand, he clutched a Heavenly Pillar, which he spun around half a turn at his chest before furiously shaking it downwards.</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>In that instant, the entire Divine Relics trembled with an earthquake.</p><p>The flung Di Ying Holy Plant of the Ancestor Trees, both crown and roots, as if pulled by an immense gravitational force, plummeted straight down, sinking into the earth.</p><p>“Sss—”</p><p>Sounds of powerlessness, terror, and wails arose from all directions of the ruins.</p><p>But there was no time for her to struggle, no time for her to resist.</p><p>“Die.”</p><p>The eyes of the deity giant opened, filled with unbridled killing intent, he hoisted the Heavenly Pillar from high above and jumped, ready to thrust it down hard once more.</p><p>“What is this?!”</p><p>Countless onlookers were dumbstruck, watching the giant deity with the Heavenly Pillar leap over their heads, and in that fleeting moment, they realized something…</p><p>No!</p><p>That wasn’t a god; that was a person!</p><p>And that “Heavenly Pillar,” with its gold sheath and fire-traversing might tearing through the sky, wasn’t a pillar— it was…</p><p>Overlord!</p><p>Overlord The Divine!</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
