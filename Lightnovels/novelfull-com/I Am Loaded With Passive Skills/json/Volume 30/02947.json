Four demi-saint level combatants, standing in this dark space, grinning foolishly at a tree, then suddenly becoming pregnant?</p><p>If this were captured with an image recording bead and shown across the Shengshen Continent, the first thing people would doubt is not the content of the image, but rather the mental state of the photographer.</p><p>Are they crazy?</p><p>What is this!</p><p>But this was reality, happening right in front of their eyes!</p><p>“Plop.”</p><p>Yue Gongli, who had also landed from the hand of the Cursed Yin Evil God, was equally astonished; she turned her head and locked eyes with Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Both realized that the battle should have ended the moment they first saw the Di Ying Holy Plant and heard her calling.</p><p>Unfortunately, they both had resistance and could withstand the power of the Holy Emperor’s Guidance.</p><p>Those who couldn’t, like these four, should uncontrollably swell with large bellies and step into the embrace of the Di Ying Holy Plant…</p><p>No!</p><p>Not four!</p><p>Xu and Yue simultaneously glanced at the bald man leading with a stick.</p><p>The Divine!</p><p>Even The Divine was cradling his big belly!</p><p>His gaze was more affectionate than the other four combined.</p><p>His expression at that moment was not simply soft; it was intoxicated, immersed, wholeheartedly invested!</p><p>“Xiang’er…”</p><p>With that deeply affectionate call, the minds of Xu and Yue completely collapsed.</p><p>“It can’t be like this, right?”</p><p>“He didn’t withstand it either?”</p><p>“Are all the Ten High Nobles so strong on the outside but dry inside?”</p><p>“No, wait, I can understand Brother Anxiety, but The Divine as well…”</p><p>The Di Ying Holy Plant seemed excited.</p><p>Hidden under the billowing black dress, which was the outward appearance, was actually an intricate interweaving of branches and roots, poised and ready to strike.</p><p>“Come, my children…”</p><p>The sound of maternal affection washed over souls like a Holy Maiden caressing the human body, softly gliding over the skin.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was covered in goosebumps and was about to shout, to wake everyone up.</p><p>But the Holy Plant’s voice had the opposite effect.</p><p>The Divine’s eyelids drooped, his deeply affectionate look disappeared, and his expression calmed. At the same time, he pressed his palm down and his belly deflated as if it was suddenly empty of air.</p><p>When he looked up again, he raised his long stick with a hook of his hand and then struck it down fiercely.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Rule of the Overlord rolled out in all directions.</p><p>The four people who were about to bypass him experienced ruptured bellies and miscarried in unison!</p><p>“What…”</p><p>“What’s this?”</p><p>“I was pregnant?”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Cen, Water, Bai, and Chang all stopped in their tracks.</p><p>As they recalled the controllable images from moments ago, their faces turned pale.</p><p>A demi-saint couldn’t handle this!</p><p>After the Evil Tree’s presence, obliterating saints was like crushing ants, irrelevant whether it’s a ghost beast from the higher void or an Upanishad demi-saint!</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu gripped the Pan Xian Ax, shouting loudly.</p><p>But just as he was about to act, Water Ghost, glancing at The Divine, put a hand on his back. Despite being filled with blood, faced with a puzzled gaze, he simply shook his head slightly.</p><p>Retreat?</p><p>The old man had never experienced the War of the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>Water Ghost was different; he was from the same era, and he knew this generation like the back of his hand.</p><p>Anyone from the Ten High Nobles could retreat.</p><p>But the one in front, his dictionary never featured the word “retreat.”</p><p>Regardless of how powerful the opponent was, what tricky tactics were used, or how tough the situation was.</p><p>Unless he died, he would only retreat if the earth itself moved forward a step.</p><p>…</p><p>“Sizzle.”</p><p>The Overlord was pulled out from the black earth, twirling between palm and back of the hand, generating a whizzing sound through the air, and finally was positioned horizontally in front of him.</p><p>The Divine looked up and also gazed forward, speaking with a hint of solemnity:</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
