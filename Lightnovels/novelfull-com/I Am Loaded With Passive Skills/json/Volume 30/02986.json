Why not invite them to join the Saint Servants, or the First Pavilion in the Sky?</p><p>That’s also good!</p><p>These people, one by one, agreed, expressing their willingness to leave the Holy Divine Palace and the Heavenly Covenant immediately, looking up to the Saint Servants for life.</p><p>As long as they could get out.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was so annoyed by these tough guys slipping away that when he no longer wanted to waste words trying to forcefully take their position, they would say something like:</p><p>“Ah, is this what the Saint Servants are like? I thought you all valued freedom and respected each other.”</p><p>“Ah, I have already helped you, even told you that those trying to kill you are led by those demi-saints under the demi-saint Taizai, yet you still want to kill?”</p><p>“Ah, I’ve also talked about what’s happening with the Fate Temple, and even then you want to kill me. If that’s the case, you’ve found an easy target. Kill me then, as I have no strength to resist.”</p><p>There’s a reason why these old slickers are still alive to this day.</p><p>Moving them with compassion and reasoning, they appeal to Xu Xiaoshou’s bit of a soft heart, launching attack after attack.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou is forced to retreat step by step.</p><p>He just wanted to earn a few semi-saint person statuses for the First Pavilion in the Sky so that everyone could live an unfettered semi-saint life, but why is it so difficult?</p><p>He handed over the lead to Elder Sang, Water Ghost, and others. These people also wouldn’t kill, arguing that undue coercion would turn all the saints against them, potentially pushing everyone to the opposing side.</p><p>Their suggestion, the same as that of the other isolated demi-saints…</p><p>“Go directly for it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wiped across the spatial mirror.</p><p>Not to mention the remaining isolated demi-saints, about ten in the mirror had almost huddled together, very close to each other.</p><p>The one in the center, Xu Xiaoshou specially added a mosaic to blur it.</p><p>Just observing like this across space, he had the illusion that the person actually already knew but didn’t care.</p><p>This person is very strong!</p><p>If nothing unexpected, this is the one discussed by those isolated demi-saints from the Northern Region…</p><p>A man stronger than The Divine!</p><p>The strongest demi-saint in the five regions!</p><p>Taizai Ci!</p><p>“Go directly for it?”</p><p>Seeing no reaction from the crowd, Xu Xiaoshou asked again, pointing forward, “They’re also moving towards the Fate Temple. If we go straight ahead, we’ll encounter them.”</p><p>He wanted to go directly at them.</p><p>Others were also restless.</p><p>Only Elder Sang and Water Ghost, these two vigilant geniuses, seemed hesitant from the beginning to the end.</p><p>“Do you really understand Taizai?” Water Ghost had not dared to call Taizai Ci by his true name since ascending to the Eighteen Heavens.</p><p>“You’ve repeated his information no less than ten times!” Xu Xiaoshou was a bit impatient.</p><p>The emphasis made him somewhat wary of this figure.</p><p>But if Taizai Ci couldn’t be taken down, the ones surnamed Hua, Rao, Yue, and another surnamed Ai after going out…</p><p>Will they all be hesitant?</p><p>Isn’t that a bit too cerebral?</p><p>“We can go.”</p><p>“If you want to strategize against him, that’s also fine.”</p><p>Elder Sang finally decided, seriously saying:</p><p>“You might not be afraid of those twelve Holy Lords, the Northern Region Seven Stars, or even if they united against you on the battlefield.”</p><p>“But once the War Saint Taizai has you tied up and you can’t resolve it quickly, the remaining demi-saints will become your fatal hindrance.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou listened, laughed heartily, and waved his big hand, “Just them? Impossible!”</p><p>What’s youth without a little reckless bravado?</p><p>“Bazhun’an was like this at his time,” Elder Sang said seriously, “which is why he faced them alone.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned, recalling the scars on old man Bazhun’an’s neck, his two severed thumbs, and suddenly nodded,</p><p>“Old man Sang, your words actually make sense.”</p><p>The contemporary youth’s main focus is not being hot-headed, just one thing: listening to advice!</p><p>“So, what do you suggest?” asked Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“You can fight Taizai, and I believe in you, but the people by his side shouldn’t affect your battlefield,” Elder Sang had too much to worry about, and he was tired.</p><p>“Hmm, so?”</p><p>“So either we go and assassinate now, taking out the demi-saints by Taizai one by one!”</p><p>“You’re just kidding, right? Didn’t Water Ghost say there’s a shadow by him, the Shadow Saint, right? A celestial dragon that strikes when least expected, catching you off guard with a slash!”</p><p>“So assassination won’t work.”</p><p>“Um, and?”</p><p>“Then someone needs to help you restrain the demi-saints by his side, until you quickly finish the battlefield and come to his aid.”</p><p>Oh?</p><p>Swish, over a dozen gazes turned at once towards Water Ghost.</p><p>His face turned pale, pointing uncertainly to himself, “Me?”</p><p>I am an Upanishad demi-saint, sure.</p><p>But I’m also a living person, not one of the Ten High Nobles; I can’t fight ten at once.</p><p>–You can’t use me like that; it’ll lead to death!</p><p>Elder Sang shook his head, looking to Bai Zhou, Cen Qiaofu.</p><p>“That’s not enough either!”</p><p>Bai Zhou shrank back; he did not want to come out, “I’m just higher void Rao Buku!”</p><p>Elder Sang finally pointed to himself.</p><p>“You?” Xu Xiaoshou was amused, “You, a mere higher void Rao Buku, stop joking…”</p><p>He stopped mid-sentence, his eyebrow rising uncertainly as a thought struck him.</p><p>Elder Sang smiled, tossing the semi-saint position in his hand,</p><p>“I have a man’s sixth sense as well.”</p><p>“If demi-saints are so easy to kill and can only enter the ruins with their true body, aren’t we taking food from the tiger’s mouth?”</p><p>“The food that someone desires to become the Ancestral God.”</p><p>He grasped the sparkling semi-saint position, examining it and appearing to see the pure power inside clashing without rule, murmuring to himself,</p><p>“Is this the self-destruction of the ignorant?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
