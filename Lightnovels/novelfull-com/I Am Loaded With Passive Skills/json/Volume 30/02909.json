Gather all the intelligence on Lei Xiaoxiao, big or small, and turn everything over to me!”</p><p>In the headquarters of the Transformation Division, Xi was anxious like an ant on a hot pot, pacing back and forth in front of a group of busy figures, finally slamming his command token down on the table:</p><p>“If you don’t have enough authority, use this. If you still can’t find anything, then go ask around!”</p><p>“The incident that happened in the Southern Region was witnessed by so many, the news can’t be blocked!”</p><p>“Mobilize your energy. Arrest those who aren’t dead for interrogation; for those who are, dig up their graves and communicate with their spirits… No matter how dire the situation, I want firsthand intelligence. Whether it’s true or false, give me an answer, understand?”</p><p>“Yes!” Not a single person at the headquarters raised their head, but their response was remarkably unified. They continued with their tasks, trying to infiltrate the Southern Region with the hardest-to-obtain intelligence.</p><p>“Chief, I have a question…” someone lifted their head from a pile of jade scrolls.</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>“Wouldn’t it be easier to find Chief Nian first since Lord Shou asked him to deliver the message, not us…”</p><p>“Are you daft?” Xi grabbed a handful of jade scrolls and hurled them over, scolding:</p><p>“The whereabouts of Nian, which even Xu Xiaoshou almost couldn’t find, do you think you can locate in a short amount of time?”</p><p>“If she truly intended to deliver the message, why would she play disappearing act as soon as she got out?”</p><p>“It’s clear she doesn’t want to get involved in this mess; she’s relying on us!”</p><p>“It’s easier to find her than to dig up events of years past, not to mention it also involves Lord Cangsheng…” someone muttered.</p><p>Xi looked over with an icy gaze. His mouth opened, but then he let out a deep sigh, his tone becoming gentler, as if he were explaining to the fool in front of him the way Hallmaster Dao used to, for the benefit of the many fools around him:</p><p>“Now, it’s not just about delivering a message.”</p><p>“Lord Cang Sheng is our Sacred Mountain’s last hope. Whether he is involved with the Lei family and the Saint Servant affects the outcome of the war after Xu Xiaoshou emerges from the ruins…”</p><p>“The Transformation Division must grasp firsthand intelligence and be prepared in advance. Xu Xiaoshou has revealed too much information with just one sentence!”</p><p>“He might just be tricking us, using reverse psychology, while also increasing our workload!” someone said stiflingly.</p><p>“Indeed!” Xi glanced over, expression cold, “But what if?”</p><p>The entire headquarters of the Transformation Division quieted down.</p><p>Xi pointed to the ground and said in a heavy voice: “Since you chose to work here, it’s the ‘what if’ you guard against. Hallmaster Dao has already left; now we must rely on ourselves even more. If you can’t do it, pack up and leave!”</p><p>There was a deadly silence.</p><p>There was only the frenzy of hurried actions and the whirring sounds of communication beads connecting to the Southern Region.</p><p>“Chief!”</p><p>Soon after, from the innermost room, a white-haired big-bearded old man emerged, holding a bunch of jade scrolls. “We have results.”</p><p>The whole headquarters fell silent for a moment.</p><p>But in an instant, everyone continued their tasks, only their ears pricked up high, like a group of rabbits.</p><p>“Focus on the main points, you know what I want to hear.” Xi had no time to go through each jade scroll; he had to finish hearing and report to Lord Cangsheng.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The big-bearded old man nodded, scowled back at a few gossip rabbits with stretched necks, and then said:</p><p>“First, Lei Xiaoxiao is confirmed dead, well before the destruction of the Lei family, with no chance of revival. The Eyes of the Great Path indeed came from her, but not by force; they were a gift.”</p><p>Xi let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>“Second, from a blood relationship perspective, Lei Xiaoxiao was Lei Xi’er’s aunt; however, Lei Xi’er and her siblings were not yet born when she died, so it excludes the likelihood of a close relationship between them… The probability of Lord Cangsheng establishing a connection with the Saint Servant through this is virtually zero.”</p><p>Xi relaxed a little more.</p><p>“Third, Lei Xiaoxiao had a good, even ‘very good,’ relationship with the Lei family; there’s no story of rebellion, running away from home, or princess syndrome. But she died before the Lei family’s downfall… In the time between Lei Xiaoxiao’s death and the Lei family’s collapse, Lord Cangsheng’s attitude towards the Lei family was… occasional care!”</p><p>Creeeak—</p><p>Suddenly, one of the rabbit intelligence officers fell off their chair, scraping it across the stone floor with a grating sound that sent shivers down everyone’s spine.</p><p>Everyone jumped in surprise.</p><p>“Sorry sorry sorry…”</p><p>The intelligence officer who caused the mishap turned pale, clasping their head and burying it into a pile of working jade scrolls, not daring to look up again.</p><p>“Phew.”</p><p>Xi took a deep breath, his heartbeat still somewhat accelerated.</p><p>The very thing he had been most worried about had finally happened!</p><p>The relationship between Lord Cang Sheng and the Lei family…</p><p>It wasn’t wrong?</p><p>Then were the arrows he angrily loosed in Saint Hall also tainted with a hint of personal emotion?</p><p>Xi felt numb.</p><p>The inside story, he really didn’t want to know, nor did he want to deal with it.</p><p>But regrettably, he was the Chief of the Transformation Division!</p><p>If the “what if” he had imagined was true…</p><p>If Lord Cangsheng was actually colluding with the Saint Servant in secret, and if Dark Division had lost the edge in intelligence…</p><p>“The Holy Emperor caught in ambush, suffering a backstabbing?”</p><p>“Lord Shou climbing the mountain, with sinful sins assisting?”</p><p>“Swords and arrows joined, and the ten elders executed?”</p><p>There was no need for such scenarios to actually occur; just the slightest hint of this possibility, without the Dark Division’s anticipation, would be enough.</p><p>As Chief, he would be derelict!</p><p>At this moment, on the surface, Xi appeared calm, but inside, he was already holding his head in agony.</p><p>Oh, Hallmaster Dao, save me…</p><p>My brain is fried…</p><p>I want a new one…</p><p>A Heavenly Mechanism Brain…</p><p>“However!”</p><p>The big-bearded man suddenly shifted his tone.</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
