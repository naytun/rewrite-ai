he believed Lord Shou surely had, hence the questions and answers inside the Crystal Palace.</p><p>“Hmm…”</p><p>The second true body nodded slightly, and thoughts surged in his mind.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot indeed had substance, truly a treasure when having an elder in the home.</p><p>“Is Apricot here?”</p><p>He smiled, gesturing towards the coral Sovereign stage, “Sit!”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit released a sizzle from its nostrils, disdainful to sit.</p><p>It had been watching here for a long time, from the beginning when the words “Di Ying Holy Plant” appeared in the conversation between Xu Xiaoshou and Li Fugui.</p><p>It came uninvited today, surely because it had lost a wager then; within its capabilities, it would help Xu Xiaoshou a little bit.</p><p>Just hoping he wouldn’t whimsically bring up that wager again.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit twisted through the air, too lazy to respond to the nickname “Apricot Darling,” it spoke independently:</p><p>“The Path manifests from the void, heartless and desireless, yet full of heart and desire, this is ‘Fulfillment’.”</p><p>“My form is reality, seven treasures and five leaks, yet also seven broken five whole, this is ‘Emptiness’.”</p><p>“The one who is Empty, their cultivation of the Path is incomplete, having not reached the state of no, nor of existence, nor of final-stage; naturally, their perception of form is ugly, thus the Dao Infant is ugly.”</p><p>With this declaration, Li Fugui already pictured it in his mind.</p><p>The Great Path is fulfilling, encompassing myriad things; cultivators only cultivate one, two, three… by comparison, this is inherently empty.</p><p>Haven’t even fully cultivated the Path, not even having penetrated the great concepts of ‘existence’ and ‘non-existence,’ let alone the issues of the Non-phase or phase.</p><p>Compared to ‘perfection,’ it is ‘hideously ugly.’</p><p>So, if a cultivator at this stage could see the Dao Infant, would the Dao Infant appear ugly?</p><p>Thus, Li Fugui turned his head to Lord Shou: “So, the Dao Infant is ugly?”</p><p>No, what are you turning into Gu Qinger now, a parrot or what… The second true body’s gaze swept past Li Fugui speechlessly but was surprised by the content of the words spoken by the Dragon Apricot Spirit.</p><p>Indeed!</p><p>The Dao Infant is ugly.</p><p>The sovereign had experienced countless rebirths, each an oversized-headed doll with short limbs, sometimes even without fully formed limbs, “ugly” was hardly the term!</p><p>“But such ugliness, or rather imperfection, attracts countless monsters from the Dark Forest?” the second true body asked.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit didn’t know what “Dark Forest” was, even less what kind of “monsters” these were.</p><p>But it clearly deeply understood the Di Ying Holy Plant, another Ancestral Tree, and was just about to speak…</p><p>“Speak plainly.” the second true body interrupted mercilessly.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit choked, in the end, had to relent.</p><p>Until today, it had also become familiar with the language habits of this era and could explain in the way most comfortable to Xu Xiaoshou:</p><p>“Though the Dao Infant is ugly, it’s because your realm is not sufficient, for the Path originally has no phase, and Dao Infant also has no phase.”</p><p>“Once you cultivate to the realm of clearly discerning the self, the Dao Infant you see will represent the state you are currently in, it will be perfect.”</p><p>Clearly discerning the self…</p><p>The second true body heard a familiar phrase,</p><p>Clearly discerning the self, Super Taoization, Feather Ascension Three Realms, behold the true name—inheritance from the first level of Ran Ming ruins.</p><p>“What is ‘Clearly discerning the self’?” he interjected.</p><p>“As the name suggests, it means discerning the self clearly.”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit brought a rolling eye and quickly explained:</p><p>“Clearly discerning the self will lead to great Taoization of the self, it is termed transcendence, also understood in human terms as… death, or eternal life.”</p><p>Li Fugui was confused, the topic suddenly deepened.</p><p>Meanwhile, the second true body was visibly excited, knowing great Taoization implies more than 80% of the Great Dao Disc!</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit continued:</p><p>“But clearly discerning the self is also a prerequisite for Super Taoization.”</p><p>“Without accomplishing this step, you will forever be unable to break free from your shackles, reach final-stage, reach the realm of the Ancestral God!”</p><p>Ah?</p><p>Li Fugui’s mouth hung open.</p><p>So the reason I couldn’t understand is because I’m approaching the realm of the Ancestral God? No wonder I couldn’t comprehend…</p><p>Oh precious dragon!</p><p>But the second true body caught another key phrase, quickly asking: “What is ‘Super Taoization’?”</p><p>“Super Taoization, as the name suggests, transcends great Taoization…”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit was quick to answer, “which means finding the method to escape great Taoization while mastering its power, thus the qualification of the Ancestral God!”</p><p>So, does super Taoization equal 90% of the Great Dao Disc, and Ancestral God equals 100%?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou recalled the profound experience when Mang Mountain’s Great Dao Disc was at 80%, feeling he had found his answer.</p><p>From 80% to 90%, this span is the process of great Taoization, the quest for the method.</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
