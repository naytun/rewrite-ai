That power of the evil god has weakened…”</p><p>Water Ghost glanced sideways and pondered aloud, “Those who withstand it ascend; those who can’t, die—a straightforward ‘Feather Ascension’ standard.”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Another loud noise.</p><p>Another higher void shattered.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>And again…</p><p>Boom!</p><p>And then continued…</p><p>Below the Upanishad, the world seemed to plunge into darkness, and the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar became the brightest light.</p><p>The people of the Holy Divine Palace were like moths, succeeding one after another, disregarding death to fill the path with lives, trying to find the lowest threshold to the Upper Realm.</p><p>Such a gruesome scene, not to mention the surrounding onlookers, even the Saint Servants watched in silence.</p><p>However…</p><p>In the Struggle for the Great Path, how can there be peace?</p><p>…</p><p>He succeeded!</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, when consciousness retook control of the body and everything was back under control,</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, though with eyes closed, was fully awake:</p><p>The transformation brought about by the 90% of the Body Dao Disc was immense!</p><p>Life force surged within him, invoking Passive Skills like Eternal Vitality and High Spirits as if a qualitative change had occurred.</p><p>Muscle strength became more restrained, but under his will, the outbreak would be more terrifying. If manifested externally, Xu Xiaoshou felt even The Divine could be countered with his physique alone…</p><p>Well, just a feeling.</p><p>“Super Taoization” seemed within reach at this moment.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that with just a thought, he could use the insight gained from pushing the Body Dao Disc to ascend to the Feather Ascension Upper Realm.</p><p>What might happen in between was another matter, but it felt like he was already able to ascend.</p><p>Well, still just a feeling.</p><p>“Clear Discrimination of Self” was still somewhat bewildered at this time. Xu Xiaoshou quickly came to his senses, knowing that going up like this might be a bit impulsive.</p><p>And…</p><p>“Passive Points: 12,624,666.”</p><p>He could still get stronger!</p><p>Ancient Martial Arts, Sacrifice Body, Sacrifice Spirit, Sacrifice Intent, Sacrifice Self—this “Body” could indeed be sacrificed, why not transcend the other three as well?</p><p>After all, The Divine are so strong, how could Ai Cangsheng, who had previously engaged in the “Divine Love Battle” at the Divine Relics, be any weaker?</p><p>Thus either remain ignorant, bark like Ai Gou.</p><p>If one learns, it should not be about mediocrity or equality, but about surpassing!</p><p>Surpassing The Divine!</p><p>And battling Ai Cangsheng again!</p><p>Ancient Martial Arts are useful indeed, yet they can only be used in the Divine Relics, only for Feather Ascension; this drawback is substantial.</p><p>The Blood Sacrifice Technique, whose side effect is death, should maximize its main function.</p><p>Combat strength must at least be amplified before death, and be usable…</p><p>Ordinary sacrifices are insufficient.</p><p>If he were to push all three Dao Discs of Body, Spirit, and Will, might he then understand beyond The Divine after sacrificing, transcending the shackles of ancient martial arts, and be able to act even on Shengshen Continent?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt it was feasible.</p><p>Though just a feeling, at the moment, it looked like he could still activate two more Passive Value Libraries of the Great Dao Disc.</p><p>He didn’t want to just feel anymore.</p><p>He wanted to act rashly, impulsively, with just one word…</p><p>“Mang!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
