one could see scattered Holy Power remnants and from the broken Path Principles…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already skirmished with a demi-saint!</p><p>“Swoosh.”</p><p>As he thought, the black-robed youth continuously teleporting ahead finally came to a stop in front of him.</p><p>His gaze intently fixed on the deep pit beneath his feet, he suddenly stretched out his hand as if he wanted to pat his own arm:</p><p>“Excuse me.”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu quickly moved aside; he didn’t want to be touched by this prickly guy.</p><p>“Where are they?”</p><p>He asked again in front of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He had no choice, as this guy had said there were six enemies.</p><p>One demi-saint was already present here, along with five from the higher void, and even so, Xu Xiaoshou was managing them…</p><p>But what if?</p><p>What if there was another demi-saint ambushed?</p><p>Seeing the youth playing mute, Cen Qiaofu immediately grew anxious: “What exactly are you looking for…”</p><p>His words abruptly stopped.</p><p>Because Xu Xiaoshou had, from some unknown depth underground, used a spirit thread as a net to extract a fist-sized crystal gemstone.</p><p>“Semi-saint position!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s eyes suddenly lit up, and he hurriedly approached to closely examine the object.</p><p>In reality, the external manifestation of a semi-saint position didn’t always look the same, even the sizes varied, but basically, they were more or less similar.</p><p>Especially that pure Holy Power scent inside, it simply couldn’t be replicated.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu only glanced once, and joyfully confirmed, “It really is a semi-saint position!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, with droopy eyelids, glanced at him sideways, “Can this fake exist?”</p><p>“No!” Cen Qiaofu shook his head, “I mean, this Eighteen Heaven truly is full of treasures, and you just dug up a semi-saint position?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou remained silent.</p><p>“Amazing, in this way, can’t your master be sanctified within the Ruins?” Cen Qiaofu, while stroking the treasure in his hands, muttered and suddenly remembered something, “Right, the people you mentioned?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou remained silent again, just staring at him.</p><p>“What are you looking at me for?” Cen Qiaofu frowned, just as he was about to say something else, his brows suddenly rose.</p><p>He quickly lowered his head to glance at the crystal gemstone in his hand, then, shocked, looked up to Xu Xiaoshou and said incredulously, “Killed, killed them?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: “What do you think?”</p><p>“Not…”</p><p>“This!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu fell into a daze, suddenly speechless.</p><p>The demi-saint, just like that killed by you, wasn’t even a quarter-hour, right?</p><p>Although Xu Xiaoshou had said to wait in the First Heavens for a half-hour before coming.</p><p>But the situation was urgent, this guy rushed off hastily, and hadn’t explained anything.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu had only coordinated with Water Ghost in the First Heavens to help Palace Master Bai Zhou temporarily relieve the influence of the power of the evil god on Sleeveless.</p><p>He had asked the two to help keep watch, and hurriedly ascended.</p><p>Although this had been delayed slightly, it was definitely less than a quarter-hour, right?</p><p>Just this…</p><p>The battle, finished?</p><p>A demi-saint, so easily killed?</p><p>“No, no, no, something’s wrong…”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu, a demi-saint himself, knew the strength of demi-saints.</p><p>He stopped his stroking motions, gently touching the semi-saint position.</p><p>It’s warm!</p><p>Is this the temperature from my own handling, or…</p><p>“Did you really kill him?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu once again looked up, still in disbelief.</p><p>How can a demi-saint perish so easily, not to mention the various mysterious ways of survival?</p><p>With the body gone, the spirit persists; with the spirit gone, the will remains; not to mention each family has its own abilities to survive in even more mysterious ways.</p><p>It can be said…</p><p>Easy to defeat, hard to kill, unless it’s a complete overbearing conquest!</p><p>Looking at Xu Xiaoshou’s calm gaze, Cen Qiaofu seemed to have received his answer, his hands holding the semi-saint position somewhat weakened.</p><p>He opened his mouth, unable to articulate any questions, he could only change the subject:</p><p>“What about the others, didn’t you say there were six?”</p><p>The demi-saint was killed.</p><p>The higher voids, surely they couldn’t have escaped?</p><p>Thinking thus, but seeing Xu Xiaoshou throw the bag containing the God Fated Star behind him, jut his chin forward, without further explanation.</p><p>What, what does that mean?</p><p>This time, Cen Qiaofu really couldn’t grasp Xu Xiaoshou’s intentions, hesitantly stepped forward, gesturing whether he should open it himself?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou jutted his chin again.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu, puzzled, crouched and personally opened the bag, pouring out its contents.</p><p>“Clank, clank, clank…”</p><p>Amid the rolling sounds of the God Fated Stars, several more fist-sized semi-saint positions tumbled out.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s mind buzzed, turning back to look dazedly at Xu Xiaoshou, his throat lost all its sounds.</p><p>…</p><p>“This, this is…”</p><p>Patterns in the background gradually lit up.</p><p>At this moment, over ten Saint Servant intelligence officers had already stepped forward.</p><p>With Bai Zhou, Elder Sang, and Water Ghost arriving last, it signified that this group of Saint Servants selected to come to the Eighteen Heavens was complete.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
