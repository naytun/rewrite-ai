Is it the ‘Holy Land’ only found in the Ancestral God Realm?” Xu Xiaoshou marveled with suspicion.</p><p>“You also know about the divine palace?” It was Yue Gongli’s turn to be surprised, “You know quite a lot!”</p><p>After a pause, without waiting for Xu Xiaoshou to say more, he spoke to himself:</p><p>“It’s a bit like the divine palace, but not entirely, a fledgling divine palace?”</p><p>“If that’s the case, then the Di Ying Holy Plant must have mutated. The Ancestor Tree isn’t just this powerful. Nine Sacrificial Gui Capital is like a salted fish compared to it, let alone having a divine palace, she doesn’t even have the combat strength of a Holy Emperor!”</p><p>My family’s worthless Dragon Apricot is also… Xu Xiaoshou silently added a sentence.</p><p>“But with a divine palace, even if it’s just a fledgling one, how can she only possess the strength of a Low Realm Holy Emperor?”</p><p>“She must be seeking some kind of method…”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou heard this, his thoughts were stirred, and he took up the train of thought of the Moon Fox, saying, “So she chose to seal off the Divine Relics, wanting to hunt and swallow everyone? Sacrifice us all to benefit herself?”</p><p>“But aside from you and me, the rest inside the ruins are mostly mediocre, without even a hint of Ancestral God Power, what kind of transformation can they bring to the Di Ying Holy Plant?” Yue Gongli interjected.</p><p>“If I were a tree, I wouldn’t eat trash either.” Xu Xiaoshou frowned, “I’d need at least a demi-saint, maybe that would be slightly useful for me to ascend to godhood and claim ancestry… I guess…”</p><p>It must be said, brainstorming in a coffin can be helpful.</p><p>When two smart heads collided, they both felt quite comfortable, but in doing so, something terrifying was also happening.</p><p>Without giving it much thought, it would’ve been fine, but upon careful consideration, it sent shivers down one’s spine.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou and Yue Gongli suddenly felt their hearts skip a beat in unison, they looked at each other and exclaimed in chorus:</p><p>“Demi-saints?”</p><p>As soon as the Ran Ming ruins were opened, many powerful demi-saints were pulled in, and then there were various gimmicks like “all beings are equal,” “no Saint Fall” and so on, trying to attract more people to participate in the inheritance battle.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had entered as well!</p><p>Considering it his last resort!</p><p>If suddenly a large number of demi-saints were to flood into the Ran Ming ruins, it would indeed be possible to close the doors and start hunting…</p><p>“No way!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly extended his hand, interrupting his own wild thoughts: “A large number of demi-saints won’t suddenly surge in, if there were any, they would have come in long ago.”</p><p>Across from him, Yue Gongli, who had taken on the Yin Corpse form, already ghastly pale, nearly burst into tears as he exclaimed:</p><p>“Big brother, you’re underestimating your influence!”</p><p>Huh?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was bewildered as he looked over.</p><p>Yet, one can’t recognize the true face of Mount Lu because one is in the mountain!</p><p>As an outsider, Yue Gongli saw things the clearest, and the more he thought about it, the more panic he felt. His face turned from white to green and he finally said:</p><p>“You’ve entered, huh!”</p><p>“If I were in charge outside, I would swap places with Ai Cangsheng, I wouldn’t know about the Di Ying Holy Plant’s mutation.”</p><p>“Then I would definitely force you out of the ruins, to let Ai Cangsheng inside obtain the Ancestral God Fate Chart, ensuring the inheritance doesn’t fall into the hands of you Saint Servants!”</p><p>So what?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt an inexplicable rush of panic; so what does this have to do with me, what does it have to do with demi-saints?</p><p>Yue Gongli slapped his thigh:</p><p>“Invitation to Saint!”</p><p>These simple three words, no need for further explanation, Xu Xiaoshou already understood what was meant, and he almost collapsed to the ground in shock.</p><p>Damn, have I become the bait on the hook for the Di Ying Holy Plant?</p><p>This time is it the Ancestor Tree setting me up? Is it the Ancestral God setting me up?</p><p>“Rumble rumble rumble…”</p><p>The booming outside the coffin became more muffled.</p><p>The Void Giant Master is big, but under the immortality life force, one becomes ten, ten become a hundred.</p><p>Now, it has been wrapped and pierced by millions of thick branches from the Ancestor Tree.</p><p>What about Divine Shedding?</p><p>The Heavenly Ancestor certainly has the power to absorb strength.</p><p>A mutated Di Ying Holy Plant can also devour life force.</p><p>One with an obvious limit, one that to this day hasn’t even seen the Ancestor Tree itself, seeing only its branches; the comparison made it clear which was superior.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grabbed the coffin board, his eyes blazing as he looked at Yue Gongli: “Team up, team up, how do we get out?”</p><p>“Yes, team up! Team up! Let’s stop harming each other.” Yue Gongli panicked as well, wanting nothing more than to stick together for warmth, “We have to get out of this damned Divine Relics!”</p><p>“How?” Xu Xiaoshou spread his hands and shouted, wishing he could grab this guy and shake him violently.</p><p>“Think! Lord Shou, aren’t you very smart? Even Hallmaster Dao lost to you!”</p><p>“You’re a fox, you’re sly, think!”</p><p>“I’m trash!”</p><p>“I’m even more trash!”</p><p>“I’m even more… Okay, stop, let’s think together.”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>One Yin Corpse, and one human about to freeze into a Yin Corpse, were spinning in place, clutching their heads in painful thought.</p><p>After a while, not a single fart of an idea emerged.</p><p>“This divine palace in its infancy, how do we break through?” Xu Xiaoshou panicked.</p><p>“How would I know, I’m just a worthless demi-saint,” Yue Gongli seemed even more panicked.</p><p>“Your Power of Three Ancestors!”</p><p>“You have the Heavenly Ancestor, Dragon Ancestor, sword cognition, Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand, you’re close to the Four Ancestor’s Power!”</p><p>“You… Okay, okay, stop.”</p><p>“Alright, we need to stay calm, solutions are like water in a sponge, there’s always some if you squeeze.”</p><p>Yue Gongli began to pace back and forth, forcing his brain to work, and soon his eyes lit up:</p><p>At the same time, Xu Xiaoshou’s brows also relaxed, and he said in unison:</p><p>“The Ten High Nobles! Divine Relics, maybe someone really can turn the tables!”</p><p>“Kong Yuhen! You said the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion could appear anywhere, can it appear here?”</p><p>They paused in unison, then asked together:</p><p>“The Divine? Are you talking about The Divine?”</p><p>“Kong Yuhen? Why are you suddenly bringing up Kong Yuhen?”</p><p>Oh my goodness, I’m screwed!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s head grew bigger in an instant, filled with a chilling feeling.</p><p>Dude, don’t mess with me, we just discussed the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion and Kong Yuhen, it was your own talking point, have you forgotten?</p><p>“The Divine! The Divine!”</p><p>Yue Gongli became excited, hopping as he said, “Do you have a way to summon The Divine? Maybe he’s got a way to beat this damn tree!”</p><p>How would I have a way to summon The Divine?</p><p>Are you sick?</p><p>The person who can summon The Divine is called Aunt Xiang!</p><p>I’m not even the same gender as her!</p><p>“Kong Yuhen!”</p><p>Without any concern, Xu Xiaoshou pulled out the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff, his primary move was to blurt out with tears in his voice:</p><p>“Kong… Spit, Brother Kong, it’s urgent, save me!”</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>As soon as the voice fell.</p><p>Within the darkness of the embryonic form of Ancestor Tree Divine Court, a ripple trembled at a certain spot, and something unusual began.</p><p>Is there hope?</p><p>Yue Gongli looked on in shock.</p><p>Could this really work?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also turned his gaze in amazement.</p><p>In the distance, at the same location, what the two saw was vastly different.</p><p>What Xu Xiaoshou saw was a vague, shadowy, dark golden three-story pavilion.</p><p>On the wooden door of the lower floor of the pavilion, a plaque bore five big characters:</p><p>“All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion!”</p><p>And I’ll be damned, as soon as those five characters appeared, the anxiety that brewed from the depths of Xu Xiaoshou’s soul swept away.</p><p>True Forget Sorrow.</p><p>What Yue Gongli saw was a person stepping through where Xu Xiaoshou saw the wooden door.</p><p>It was someone somewhat unfamiliar…</p><p>An ordinary demi-saint!</p><p>He seemed startled too; as soon as he entered this world, he saw a Raging Giant, wrapped in tree branches, that was taller than the sky.</p><p>“What the?”</p><p>He shuddered.</p><p>Suddenly, a black branch shot out from behind him, piercing his head, and extracted a demi-saint person’s position.</p><p>Yue Gongli also shuddered, unable even to utter an “ouch,” he just exclaimed in shock:</p><p>“What the?!”</p><p>Delivered to us?</p><p>Scram!</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
