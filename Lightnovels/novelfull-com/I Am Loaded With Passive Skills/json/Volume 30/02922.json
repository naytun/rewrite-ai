Newcomer, have you signed the contract yet? Remember to leak out whatever you hear in the shadowy forms gathering; by tomorrow, you’ll be granted the rare qualification to meet a Saint! Every one of your family members will have it!”</p><p>“Stop tormenting the newcomer, Zhao Xidong… New one, remember, if you don’t want to die, just keep your mouth shut. Otherwise, you won’t even need to wait till tomorrow; the scattered experts from the north will need to have a word with you soon.”</p><p>“After enduring untold hardships, you finally cultivated to the higher void level? Welcome to the Higher Void World, congratulations on waking from the dream and beginning the next round of nightmares! Hehehe…”</p><p>“To the higher void, the true world! Without becoming a Saint, you’ll forever be a slave!”</p><p>“Haitang’er, our boss has called upon you, bring your Valley of Floral Fragrance out and speak!”</p><p>“… Saint, it’s the Saint of the Holy Emperor… um, from the beginning.”</p><p>“Eh, you’re really here? Heh, I was just joking. I’m from the Jiang clan of the northern region… that, is there still a spot in the Seven Breaks where I can sneak in? I also want to see the scenery of the outside world…”</p><p>“Be quiet, can’t you see that the scattered expert from the north’s head is about to split open? Let him say a word, after all, he’s a demi-saint.”</p><p>“Yes, the Saint must not be insulted, you already have taken…”</p><p>Jabbering, the scattered expert from the north felt his head swell.</p><p>The problem with the shadowy forms gathering is that once the number of people increases, all sorts of birds show their true forms.</p><p>One word chases another, and what follows is a saying even more outrageous than the last, completely unstoppable.</p><p>Things that should be said, and things that shouldn’t, are all spilled without any regard for whether there are newcomers present, all poured out at once.</p><p>And who ends up cleaning the mess?</p><p>It’s them, these demi-saints guarding the rear!</p><p>Although it’s also a kind of fun that can be considered letting off steam, heh heh…</p><p>Of course, the scattered expert from the north wouldn’t get angry over this, waiting until after the excitement had cooled down and everyone had respectfully quietened down to him, before he finally said:</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is no pushover.”</p><p>“Even if you can’t die in the god slayer ruins, he holds grudges too deeply. After coming out, he will definitely swing by your house.”</p><p>“Whether he kills your family’s demi-saint is another matter, but with his feather-plucking temperament, your family treasures are definitely not safe.”</p><p>“Hiss, that makes sense!” The conversation at the long table stirred up again.</p><p>The scattered expert from the north didn’t stop this time but continued:</p><p>“Moreover, your clan’s demi-saint is just average; if one aspect of your techniques was stronger, you really could send him away within the ruins, making the aftermath much worse.”</p><p>“This is robbing the path! You’re robbing his ancestral god fate chart path; wouldn’t Lord Shou fight you to death when he comes out?”</p><p>“Oh, you won’t die in the god slayer ruins, you might win half a move and feel good about it, send him off during the chaos.”</p><p>“But back in the five regions, with his incessantly trickery-filled and immensely strong methods, which clan’s demi-saint could confidently catch even half a move without dying?”</p><p>“No, that’s wrong. Who is confident they won’t die?”</p><p>Those words silenced hundreds of people.</p><p>The shadowy forms gathering fell into an unusual quietness, and even if their expressions were blurred, one could sense a certain gravity in the atmosphere, all thinking:</p><p>“This is bad.”</p><p>“Our demi-saint was too caught up in being the first to spread the news, enjoying the thrill and forgetting about the consequences of just this one thrill!”</p><p>But then again, a quick rethink, and they all let go of their concerns.</p><p>Can anyone reach demi-saint without being clever?</p><p>Unless it’s a determined effort to show devotion to the Holy Divine Palace, aiming for a worldly spot, otherwise, it’s assumed most are just going to play around in the Ran Ming ruins.</p><p>Seeking Xu Xiaoshou for a fight?</p><p>Nonsense! Turn around at the mere mention of it!</p><p>Why insist on picking a fight, kissing up to the Holy Divine Palace’s backside?</p><p>“I forgot to turn off the fire at home, I better go check it out.”</p><p>“Me too…”</p><p>“Then me too…”</p><p>Many people directly disconnected and went back to report to their own demi-saint or to take care of another clan’s demi-saint.</p><p>Demi-saint not at home?</p><p>No problem, that won’t stop me from showing loyalty!</p><p>The northern region isn’t all about fighting and killing; it’s about human relationships, keeping a warm face to stick to a cold one!</p><p>“Did the scattered expert from the north come here just to say this?” Some laughed and raised the question, “Anyone smart enough would see through this layer.”</p><p>“How disrespectful! How can you speak to the demi-saint of the north like that?”</p><p>“Kid, you really think hiding behind a shadowy forms gathering gives you the right to spout nonsense, huh? You better hope my Beigu Sect doesn’t find your family’s address!”</p><p>“Count my Meng Luoyang family in too. You think just because the scattered expert from the north is easy to talk to you can take liberties?”</p><p>“State your name, let my Liyue Sect teach you a lesson!”</p><p>“Enough!” The scattered expert from the north waved his hand to silence these overly enthusiastic voices, saying helplessly, “Actually, that’s not mainly what I came here to say, it’s just… how to put it?”</p><p>After a slight pause, he continued with a contemplative tone:</p><p>“It just feels, maybe it’s been so long since a ‘Invitation to Saint’ has been issued, it’s come so suddenly, could there be a trap?”</p><p>“Or perhaps, the demi-saints of the five regions have been self-imprisoned for so long, and now all are suddenly mobilizing, just because of Xu Xiaoshou, it all feels a bit strange… Hmm, can’t quite pin it down.”</p><p>The scattered expert from the north clicked his tongue twice, shaking his head: “It’s just a feeling.”</p><p>“A demi-saint’s feeling.”</p><p>“A demi-saint’s whim.”</p><p>“A demi-saint’s advanced foreknowledge ability!”</p><p>“A demi-saint’s supremely ultimate perfect prediction…”</p><p>After hearing these ambiguous responses, the crowd at the long table was left speechless, amidst a flurry of sycophantic voices.</p><p>Unexpectedly, amidst these flatteries, the previously outspoken person also voiced in surprise:</p><p>“Coincidentally, I had the same hunch, so I didn’t accept Ai Cangsheng’s ‘Invitation to Saint.’ Changyi and the others didn’t listen to my advice and chose to enter the ruins directly… Scattered expert from the north, what’s your feeling, could you elaborate further?”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
