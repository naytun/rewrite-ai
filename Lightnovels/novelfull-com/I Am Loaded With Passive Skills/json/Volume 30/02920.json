You already have the qualifications of an Ancestral God, so what’s this talk about tens of thousands of miles?”</p><p>The second true body was stunned, then his pupils trembled violently.</p><p>Qualifications of an Ancestral God?</p><p>Super Taoization?</p><p>Had Yue Gongli already reached the level of Super Taoization?</p><p>But no, he hadn’t even revealed his Power Upanishad Formation yet!</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit saw Xu Xiaoshou’s expression and felt as though the tens of thousands of miles had already occurred in reality. After a hesitant glance from its dragon eyes, it reminded:</p><p>“A perfect Dao Infant does not represent the perfection of the person’s Great Path, but their potential.”</p><p>“As for how strong or weak, and what the situation is, you’ll have to discern it yourself.”</p><p>“Also, there’s been a change in the Di Ying Holy Plant, do not approach it, this would be for the best.”</p><p>After speaking, the Dragon Apricot Spirit, like an old shaman who broke taboo, burst into a flash of golden light and disintegrated, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>A change?</p><p>The second true body was about to ask more when, upon a glance, he noticed Dragon Apricot had slipped away.</p><p>Crap!</p><p>This was just leaving people hanging!</p><p>No, the fact that even Dragon Apricot dared not say it has already indicated something…</p><p>Considering the oddness and trickery of the Dark Forest, a trace of alarm flashed in the eyes of the second true body.</p><p>Could it be that his main body’s guess had come true?</p><p>Did the Di Ying Holy Plant also have aspirations, seeking to ascend the ranks of the Ten Ancestors as a mere tree and cultivate to transcendence?</p><p>Shaking his head…</p><p>The thoughts of the second true body within the Crystal Palace were in sync with those of Xu Xiaoshou’s main body within the Divine Relics:</p><p>It wasn’t Yue Gongli who was perfect, but his Dao.</p><p>His Dao had a future that qualified for Ancestral Godhood!</p><p>“Buzz…”</p><p>He looked at the spatial mirror in front of him, still somewhat unstable.</p><p>And at Yue Gongli inside, holding the Dao Infant and slaying in all directions, occasionally fighting the urge to devour the “Perfect Fruit”…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but “gurgle” as he also swallowed saliva.</p><p>“Dao Infant…”</p><p>Yes, he finally saw it clearly!</p><p>The Dao Infant of Yue Gongli, in his own eyes, was not at all the ugly form of Yue Gongli’s head.</p><p>On the contrary!</p><p>It was like a fruit peeled of its skin, the flesh crystal clear and plump, sweet and juicy, simply tempting one towards crime!</p><p>“Buzz…”</p><p>The spatial mirror trembled once more, revealing the path that Yue Gongli, while protecting the Dao Infant, was carving through the monster sea in a desperate attempt to escape to the sky.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s observation made the path feel increasingly familiar.</p><p>“Is he heading in my direction?”</p><p>Suddenly, with a look down, he was startled to discover…</p><p>It wasn’t Yue Gongli heading towards him; instead, his own feet were moving unconsciously, rushing towards Yue Gongli’s position!</p><p>An awareness that he had been deceiving himself involuntarily burst forth, and Xu Xiaoshou finally confronted his true self:</p><p>“The Power of the Heavenly Ancestor, the power of the evil god, the Power of Divinity, a perfect balance of the Three Great Ancestral Powers—this is a completely new path to Godhood and Ancestor.”</p><p>“If I eat it, if I devour this Dao Fruit, I’ll grasp the Balanced Path, allowing me to balance the powers of my ancestral sources while simultaneously balancing the three paths of the Sword Spirit Body!”</p><p>“Therefore, I need this Dao Fruit even more than Yue Gongli!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>From afar, there seemed to be exclamations carried by the wind.</p><p>Startled, Xu Xiaoshou came back to his senses and saw that the scene in the spatial mirror now overlapped with what was before him.</p><p>Countless Suture Monsters were stepping on him, using him as a stepping stone to leap toward the Dao Infant that Yue Gongli was protecting.</p><p>But they were all repelled in unison!</p><p>These were weak monsters whose essence was hardly worth mentioning, but their number…</p><p>Was overwhelming!</p><p>They filled the entire Dark Forest!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, help me—”</p><p>Yue Gongli’s cry became so sharp and clear; He was standing on the shoulders of the Six Marrow Corpse King, shattering wave after wave of monsters.</p><p>Yet those monsters were immortal, returning to the Life Great Path only to condense again, marching to their deaths one after the other.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze was fixed on that perfect Dao Fruit.</p><p>Temptation!</p><p>Deadly temptation!</p><p>But he could still hold onto a fraction of self-control and replied, “You run by yourself, into the Dark Forest and away from me!”</p><p>“I can’t run—”</p><p>Yue Gongli’s desperate shout echoed, “We are all heading deeper into this forest!”</p><p>What?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around suddenly and realized he was already very close to where his sword cognition had previously paused.</p><p>Are the monsters pushing us along?</p><p>No!</p><p>These feeble monsters are just a diversion; it’s a more lethal temptation at the far end of the forest, luring people deeper inside.</p><p>Di Ying Holy Plant!</p><p>In his mind, the last cautioning from the Dragon Apricot Spirit flashed, and Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils dilated.</p><p>He must stay away!</p><p>He must get far away from it!</p><p>“Spatial teleportation—”</p><p>Yue Gongli screamed, “Take me with you, let’s go together!”</p><p>Without a second thought, Xu Xiaoshou stepped on the Great Dao Disc under his feet, ready to teleport away by himself.</p><p>Understanding him well, Yue Gongli finally put all his cards on the table, “My coffin is big enough for two!”</p><p>Those words carried too much weight.</p><p>No one was foolish; what if there were accidents later?</p><p>A single sweet coffin was better than having two people die consecutively under the bizarre power of the Dark Forest or being expelled from the Divine Relics.</p><p>“Teleport!”</p><p>Without hesitation, wrapped in the spatial power, Xu Xiaoshou undertook the teleportation with Yue Gongli.</p><p>The target, the initial landing spot of the Divine Relics!</p><p>Whoosh…</p><p>The scene before his eyes blurred.</p><p>The tide of monsters disappeared, and time quietened down.</p><p>“Ah~ oh~”</p><p>Yue Gongli looked ahead, holding the plump and juicy Dao Fruit, emitting a sound of despair.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lifted his eyes to look.</p><p>Was this any kind of landing spot?</p><p>It was a bizarre world shrouded in darkness; though it was so dark that one couldn’t see their own hands, they could still clearly see ahead…</p><p>A towering black tree with gnarly roots and sprawling branches, shaping into the flowing silhouette of a beautiful dress.</p><p>Her tree body was graceful, with thousands of hair-like tendrils hanging down, and the overall appearance was that of the great Mother of the World morphed into the form of a human, with a graceful figure and a full belly.</p><p>The six thickest branches extending from her torso, like six arms, were embedded into her crown, resembling a human face without features.</p><p>“Crap…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face went pale as his eyelids began to twitch uncontrollably.</p><p>After a jolt to his spirit, “Spirit Awakening” continuously triggered, followed by a graceful, compassionate, and kind voice echoing in his mind:</p><p>“Come! My child…”</p><p>“Get closer, just a little closer…”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
