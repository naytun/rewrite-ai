Probably only your Master will force you awake by dying himself!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s breathing became hurried.</p><p>He almost turned and cursed at these Saint Servant bosses, but stopped himself.</p><p>Yes, in their eyes, he was the insight, a super Divine Enlightenment status rare in a lifetime.</p><p>Several higher void people’s lives for three transcendental Upanishads, is it worth it?</p><p>—Absolutely worth it!</p><p>In an instant, Xu Xiaoshou also realized why that Rao Wangze came and didn’t harm Elder Sang, Water Ghost, and others, only taking the lives of lesser Saint Servants.</p><p>This was the transcendental Upanishad!</p><p>As Rao Wangze came for the Ancestral God Fate Chart, wouldn’t he covet the “Super Taoization” a notch higher than the Ancestral God Fate Chart?</p><p>If he moved against Elder Sang, Water Ghost, and others, they would surely awaken him first.</p><p>Then, he would not see the most perfect realm of this super Taoization, the beauty of it lost in the taking.</p><p>And in his eyes, even though he won a round on Abyss Island, could that make him an “enemy”?</p><p>It was just borrowing the power of the Four Divine Pillars…</p><p>Just defeating a thought incarnation of the Holy Emperor limited by the Heavenly Ancestor Spirit…</p><p>That was all!</p><p>Nothing!</p><p>Thinking this, Xu Xiaoshou clenched his fists.</p><p>Everyone around him stared, eyes burning with intensity, heat, and unwillingness, but without resentment!</p><p>They, had pinned all their hopes on him, the new second-in-command saint servant, for two words…</p><p>Lord Shou!</p><p>Lord Shou, had become a legend!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt he had failed his mission, wanted to say “sorry,” but…</p><p>Would sorry be of any use?</p><p>What explanation could there be?</p><p>I was just playing, I didn’t take the Divine Relics seriously, with so many bosses around me, I was too immersed in cultivating, in enlightenment, that I forgot your life and death?</p><p>Yes, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even clearly know who or what those dead higher void people were.</p><p>He was silent for a long time, and took a deep breath, passing over all those scorching expectant gazes, his unfocused eyes turned toward Elder Sang, voice hoarse:</p><p>“The next time this happens, wake me up directly.”</p><p>Elder Sang snorted through his nose, turned his head, his expression calm and ghastly just like the first time they met in Tiansang Spirit Palace:</p><p>“You know, I won’t.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou furrowed his brow, almost lashed out against the old man, wanting to say “Are you dumb, old man? I can have insight at any time!”</p><p>His words stuck in his throat.</p><p>His extended hand stopped mid-air.</p><p>He gave Elder Sang a long, deep look, took a deep breath and withdrew his gaze, no longer dwelling on the matter, just turning his head slowly, looking towards the murky sky, his profound eyes also tinged with a bit of shadow.</p><p>Rao… Wang… Ze…</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou was as calm as the second-in-command saint servant should be, his voice devoid of any ripples.</p><p>Bai Zhou, impatient, grasped his hair and took another gulping drink:</p><p>“Where can we go? Now we can only summon the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar! That guy might have already dug a trap waiting for us, and our situation now is more troubled than when Yue Gongli was…”</p><p>“I’ll summon it.” Xu Xiaoshou swiped his sleeve, it turned to flying ash, like burnt leaves carried away.</p><p>“And then?” Bai Zhou, and everyone else, looked over.</p><p>“Then…” Xu Xiaoshou still looked at the sky.</p><p>“Kill our way to the sky.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
