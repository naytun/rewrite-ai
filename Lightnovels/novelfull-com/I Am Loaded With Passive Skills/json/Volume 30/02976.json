It’s me, Yue Gongli!</p><p>In front of me, whose thoughts are you all entertaining? I’m certainly not his substitute!</p><p>It was no use…</p><p>At this moment, everyone’s gaze towards Yue Gongli carried a mix of suspicion, adoration, tension, and a touch of desire.</p><p>It seemed as if all Yue Gongli needed to say now was:</p><p>“Indeed, I am Hallmaster Dao.”</p><p>These people would immediately be ready to break away from the sacred mountain and embrace his protection.</p><p>After cracking a joke, Yue Gongli couldn’t laugh anymore, he realized a terrifying fact:</p><p>Hallmaster Dao had been in power for thirty years, and the scariest part wasn’t his diligent governance, nor was it replacing real people with Heavenly Mechanism Puppets.</p><p>The truly horrifying aspect was that he had brainwashed everyone on the sacred mountain!</p><p>Just one name…</p><p>No, just one plausible sentence, and these people’s minds turn to mush, completely losing their reason, no different from idiots!</p><p>“Damn!”</p><p>Yue Gongli cursed in his heart.</p><p>Aren’t you afraid I’m Xu Xiaoshou in disguise, so easily abducted?</p><p>But…</p><p>Does that matter?</p><p>That’s not important anymore!</p><p>What’s important is, what if one day Hallmaster Dao really does come, and he says such a sentence to these people?</p><p>Yue Gongli felt inexplicably agitated, more so than he had ever felt facing the Di Ying Holy Plant within the divine palace’s embryonic form.</p><p>A coin only has two sides, heads or tails, but when tossed, there’s a small chance it could stand on its edge.</p><p>To ordinary people, the probabilities are merely heads, tails, and the third variable.</p><p>To Hallmaster Dao, it’s either heads or tails!</p><p>He controlled all the variables on the sacred mountain.</p><p>And now, he had left the sacred mountain and ventured into the five domains of the continent…</p><p>“Communication bead?”</p><p>“Communication bead?”</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao!”</p><p>Yue Gongli suddenly woke to the increasingly clear calls by his ear and looked around: “Has Hallmaster Dao arrived?”</p><p>Dozens of old men suddenly looked at him with doubt, unsure if he was playing dumb or hinting for them not to speak carelessly later, lest they divulge the Way of the Heavens’ energy movement and be overheard by outsiders.</p><p>Yue Gongli glanced at the plaque in front of him, swallowed hard, and with numbness that left no room for jest, said, “Has ‘The Divine’ been found?”</p><p>“Reporting to… Communication bead, not yet!” The responders were animated as if injected with adrenaline, their words melodic with highs and lows.</p><p>I’m really not Hallmaster Dao… Yue Gongli almost slapped them, his mouth twitching as he said,</p><p>“Then he must have either entered some secret place… no, more likely, he has directly gone to the Thirty Three Heavens.”</p><p>Everyone nodded vigorously, not questioning why the Divine Relics were still active or why the trials hadn’t ended:</p><p>“Communication bead is right!”</p><p>Yue Gongli opened his mouth, unable to ask any more questions; these people had clearly become human-shaped Heavenly Mechanism Puppets.</p><p>He numbly instructed:</p><p>“First, do not engage with Erzhu.”</p><p>“Second, when Taizai Ci arrives, have him lead the demi-saints to stand guard outside this plaque, waiting for Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>“Third, once I enter the God Slaying Temple, contact me after a half-hour reflective interval, then every half-hour thereafter, though I will not respond.”</p><p>“Fourth, have Hua Yuan stop his solo activities and come meet me… during which none of you should make eye contact or engage in dialogue with him!”</p><p>While issuing these orders, Yue Gongli grew increasingly frustrated:</p><p>“Fifth, Wangze Holy Emperor is not Xu Xiaoshou, Bazhun’an does not consume the fish of ‘The Divine’.”</p><p>Everyone nodded like pecking chickens, committing every word to memory without fault.</p><p>Yue Gongli, seeing this, opened his mouth again, then silently looked to the heavens, nearly bursting into tears.</p><p>Indeed, they didn’t ask why not to engage with Erzhu, why Xu Xiaoshou would surely come, why I wouldn’t respond, how Hua Yuan could meet me without conversation or eye contact.</p><p>Most outrageously…</p><p>Wangze Holy Emperor is not Xu Xiaoshou, do you truly understand what that means?</p><p>Bazhun’an does not consume the fish of ‘The Divine’; what in the world does that imply, aren’t you curious at all?</p><p>I’m so damn curious!</p><p>I even want to ask what that means.</p><p>You just nod, no longer asking questions, you trust me this much?</p><p>— Hallmaster Dao, are you a dog?</p><p>Yue Gongli, wiping his eyes, couldn’t help but transform into a stubborn fish, plunging headfirst into the plaque.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>A rich aroma of the power of the evil god diffused then converged into nothingness, as if nothing had happened.</p><p>“Power of the Evil God?” someone exclaimed, then relaxed, “Hmm, power of the Evil God.”</p><p>“This doesn’t seem like Communication Bead’s ability, it feels a bit different…”</p><p>“Does it matter? With this thing out, it doesn’t look like the God Slaying Temple, but more like the Evil God Temple!”</p><p>“That’s for sure, it doesn’t matter, haha.”</p><p>“Speaking of which…”</p><p>“No need to ask, Lao Zhou, it’s rare for him to have come back; heaven knows, the earth knows, you and I know, that’s enough.”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>“Cough, just say it, I really can’t hold back anymore… why isn’t Wangze Holy Emperor Xu Xiaoshou? If Bazhun’an ate the fish of ‘The Divine’, what would happen? What kind of intricate and strange story is between these?”</p><p>“Err, don’t know, but the way he speaks, he surely has his reasons, obviously expecting you wouldn’t figure it out, he wants exactly this impact.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
