Lord Cangsheng is a person without faults!</p><p>In Big Beard’s eyes, in the eyes of all intelligence workers of the Transformation Division, even in Xi’s eyes…</p><p>Actually everyone knows, nothing can be dug up about Lord Cangsheng.</p><p>If any misdeed could be found on him, even just a little, it’s impossible for him to have held the position among the Ten High Nobles, with a foreign surname, as one of the three emperors for so long!</p><p>The sky of Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe might collapse, but Lord Cangsheng will never fall.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao might betray the sacred mountain, but Lord Cangsheng is always worthy of faith.</p><p>Yet Xi thought of the time when he had pushed Lord Cangsheng’s wheelchair and asked him a question; his loyalty, it seems, was not to the Holy Divine Palace!</p><p>“Setting aside rationality…”</p><p>Xi turned toward Big Beard, “Do you personally think, could Lord Cangsheng betray the sacred mountain?”</p><p>Big Beard the Elder lifted his hand to his ear, his face turning red with vehemence:</p><p>“If Emperor Lord Cangsheng even slightly associated with the Saint Servants, I’d stand on my head to eat sh*t!”</p><p>…</p><p>“He said, seven represents departure…</p><p>“He said, the moon sees no seventh night of encounters, and people part with tears on the seventh night.”</p><p>“He also asked us to convey to you, to consider the ‘tears’ and to turn from the dark to the light, it’s not too late.”</p><p>Xi swallowed hard, bowing her head, “Those were his exact words.”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng quietly looked at the sky.</p><p>Xi waited in silence for a long while, then looking up, she unexpectedly saw on Emperor Lord Cang Sheng’s face, for the first time, such a clear expression of “distraction.”</p><p>His eyes that knew only the Great Path and knew not compassionate emotions, were no longer indifferent, no longer icy cold; they harbored incredibly complex feelings.</p><p>What kind of feelings were they…</p><p>Xi couldn’t understand.</p><p>After all, she had never been in love.</p><p>The Emotion Sword Technique is the most difficult Ancient Sword Technique to cultivate, and love is the most complex of all human Seven Emotions and Six Desires.</p><p>A tragedy all the more so.</p><p>And yet, this is only part of the Emotion Sword Technique…</p><p>Xi’s thoughts wandered off to the horizon; in her world was only the sword, she could not enter the heart of Emperor Lord Cang Sheng.</p><p>“Do you know?”</p><p>Suddenly, Ai Cangsheng spoke, his voice extremely smooth, extremely gentle, “She once told me that if…”</p><p>With a turn of his head, when he saw the face in front of him with widened eyes, full of intense curiosity and desire to listen, yet very young.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng’s gaze went cold, almost bursting with killing intent, but eventually returned to indifference, he spoke calmly:</p><p>“Has Dao Qiongcang been found?”</p><p>Huh?</p><p>Xi was stunned.</p><p>No, keep talking! Please continue! I was listening, how could you swallow your words suddenly, just like Hallmaster Dao?</p><p>This is torment!</p><p>“Not yet.”</p><p>Xi had to return to the matter at hand, earnestly saying, “The Southern Region has indeed been unsettled lately, and the increased numbers of Divine Sorcerers that you mentioned, we’ve looked into it, and mainly a ‘Divine Sect’ has risen.”</p><p>The Divine Sect?</p><p>Ai Cangsheng’s gaze flickered slightly.</p><p>This faction had been mentioned to him by Dao Qiongcang, even to the extent that they had a detailed discussion about the future of the Divine Secrets.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang said, the Divine Sect was not his.</p><p>He also said, because the five great aristocratic families of the Holy Emperor were suspicious, he secretly support it to create confusion.</p><p>And yet he also said, he had long been monitoring the development of Divine Secrets in the Southern Region and thought that the rise of the Divine Sect was inevitable, and he had embedded his pieces within it early on.</p><p>Yet again he had said, the Divine Sect was his own creation, and when the time came, he would dive under the surface and also resurface.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng truly didn’t know which sentence Elder Dao the Flamboyant said was true, which was false, which was a joke, and which was serious.</p><p>But in the past, he hadn’t paid much attention to this Divine Sect, because Dao Qiongcang was watching over it.</p><p>But now that Xi raised it, all memories came flooding back like a tide…</p><p>Ai Cangsheng immediately concluded that Dao Qiongcang definitely had something to do with this sect—anything unrelated, he wouldn’t lay so much groundwork beforehand!</p><p>But…</p><p>For someone as smart as him to have gone under, would he really enter such a blatantly obvious organization, with even the name ‘Divine Sect’ so ostentatious?</p><p>Ai Cangsheng frowned, pondered without success, and then casually asked, “This Divine Sect, who is the leader?”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
