What can she do to fight me?</p><p>What about the Divine Relics? Together, the two of them will thoroughly understand the rules here, and even ‘feeling stones to cross the river’ will be faster than others flying, right?</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A sudden thunderous sound echoed from a distant place.</p><p>It wasn’t the sound of the battlefield from The Divine’s side, but instead…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lifted his left palm.</p><p>Everyone else also raised their left palms.</p><p>The Ancestral God Ranking instantaneously expanded in front of the dozens of people present, confirming one thing:</p><p>“Damn, it’s Yue Demi-Saint’s location!”</p><p>“No way? Did they really predict it right? Are they actually summoning that ‘Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar’?”</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>“My goodness!”</p><p>“I’ve got goosebumps!”</p><p>“So this is what the world of a Boss is like?”</p><p>“I always thought I was smart enough, but now—at last, I understand why I’m just at the higher void level.”</p><p>“Shh! Elder Sleeveless is also at the higher void level.”</p><p>“Hehe, you’re at the higher void level because you’ve maxed out at it. The others are at the higher void level because they want to comprehend the Upanishad there!”</p><p>“Wuwuwu, stop it…”</p><p>A spatial mirror opened up, and everyone, like bystanders on the wall, turned inward towards themselves.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even need to go anywhere to see the situation at Yue Gongli’s end.</p><p>Indeed, the inside soon displayed the expected magnificent scene:</p><p>A towering totem built from enormous blue stones fell from the sky, crushing a large group of people around Yue Gongli’s body.</p><p>Those who reacted in time and started running, at the Cutting Path and higher void level, were swallowed up in an instant by the terrifying Evil God’s Energy emanating from the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar.</p><p>Biting her teeth in frustration, Yue Gongli summoned the Cursed Yin Evil God, managing to withstand and devour a massive amount of the Evil God’s Energy.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar emitted a blue light, looking like it was ready for passage.</p><p>The summoner of this pillar, who was at the higher void level, now had half his body severed, was still clinging to life, and had to complete the mission; he was left with no choice but to brace himself and press his hand upon that pillar.</p><p>“I’ll bet something goes wrong,” Water Ghost said with a smile.</p><p>“I bet on that too.”</p><p>As soon as Elder Sang’s words fell, there was a thud, and in the mirror world, the higher void level person exploded, his flesh turned into a hazy dissipating Evil God’s Energy, about to spread towards the surrounding spectators.</p><p>“Order!”</p><p>Yue Gongli made hand seals, enduring every gleaming, bare scrutiny, and after swallowing that Evil God’s Energy, waved at a demi-saint not far away.</p><p>“Northern Region’s Cheng Guanglu of the Enlightened Cheng Family,” Water Ghost said after thinking for a moment.</p><p>“The Enlightened Cheng Family has already declined, with no one to carry on the legacy, the highest among the younger generation is just at the higher void level; Cheng Guanglu is about to give up,” Elder Sang shook his head.</p><p>“Actually, it’s not so much giving up; with the Great Path having no way through, he can only turn to the Holy Divine Palace, hoping to receive protection this time, bless himself and incidentally his offspring.”</p><p>“But the cost might be his life.”</p><p>“Indeed…”</p><p>“Hahahaha!”</p><p>This uncanny laughter interrupted the exchange between Water Ghost and Elder Sang, who turned their heads bizarrely, “What are you laughing at now?”</p><p>“Nothing, nothing…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his hands repeatedly, wiping away tears, “I’m just… happy, I thought of some happy things.”</p><p>Oh, heavens!</p><p>You have finally opened your eyes!</p><p>Have I, Xu Xiaoshou, finally come to the end of the hardship and reached this point?</p><p>If before I harbored a tad of doubt toward the resolute words of Water Ghost and Elder Sang,</p><p>then now, as I catch a glimpse of Yue Gongli’s deathly pale face in the spatial mirror, the resolute expression of demi-saint Cheng Guanglu as he faced death…</p><p>Right now, Xu Xiaoshou truly wanted to grab the heads of those eight Level Three experts and stomp them hard into the ground.</p><p>So detestable!</p><p>Your days have been far too delightful!</p><p>To think I felt pity for you and your body full of sword energy, reduced to the Acquired Stage with only eight fingers left!</p><p>Turns out you were playing the victim, but your days have been so much more lush and comfortable than mine!</p><p>If I had such allies before, how could I possibly have been played around by Hallmaster Dao, or even used Aunt Xiang to trick Elder Dao the Flamboyant?</p><p>“Wuwuwu…”</p><p>“What’s wrong with you now?”</p><p>“Nothing, I’m just thinking of some sad things, but I’m also very happy, wuwuwu.”</p><p>“He’s crazy.”</p><p>“Don’t mind him; he’s always like this when he’s having an episode.”</p><p>Tap.</p><p>In the mirror world, demi-saint Cheng Guanglu, with a solemn face, slammed his palm heavily, pressing it against the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar.</p><p>Crack.</p><p>His head exploded like a watermelon.</p><p>The semi-saint person flew out and merged into the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar.</p><p>At that moment, Yue Gongli could no longer bear it, her eyes nearly bursting with fury.</p><p>“Damn!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
