Listen well, she has a big gourd, and inside there’s liquor; the wine is water, you can definitely find it.” Xu Xiaoshou had been controlled and inhabited many times in the past, now he trusted the Water Ghost that much.</p><p>The Water Ghost pinched his golden beast mask, pondered for a good ten breaths, and then sighed deeply:</p><p>“Xu Yue Grey Palace and the Saint Servant don’t get along, I’ve helped Bazhun’an on Abyss Island, Palace Master Bai Zhou definitely doesn’t like me, there’s no way we can cooperate.”</p><p>A corner of Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth lifted.</p><p>Act!</p><p>Keep acting!</p><p>He certainly knew this was an excuse.</p><p>Indeed, the Water Ghost had great powers, but also a big attitude, or to put it another way, he didn’t like to stick his neck out. He’d only help if he was paid.</p><p>During that battle on Abyss Island, Bazhun’an paid a price to ask for his help, and he agreed to lend a hand.</p><p>That one favor, was damning the Holy Divine Palace from top to bottom, but so worth it!</p><p>Could the Water Ghost ally with Xu Yue Grey Palace just on his say-so?</p><p>Yes!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze lowered, looking at the Water Ghost’s upper body that he’d extracted from his own chest, the absent lower half:</p><p>“Senior Water Ghost, what color of underwear are you wearing today….”</p><p>“Stop! Xu Xiaoshou!” the Water Ghost bellowed heavily, casting a glance at the person beside him without leaving a trace.</p><p>“Then let me tell you a joke,” Xu Xiaoshou changed the topic, “Back in the Dark Forest, haha, you didn’t see it, but Yue Gongli had a cesarean birth….”</p><p>“Stop! Xu Xiaoshou!” Yue Gongli’s body jolted, shouting heavily.</p><p>A complex expression instantly appeared on the Water Ghost’s blurry face.</p><p>What?</p><p>You’ve also got dirt on you in this kid’s hands?</p><p>Is cesarean birth what I think it is?</p><p>“Hehe….”</p><p>A smile blossomed on Xu Xiaoshou’s face.</p><p>Two birds with one stone, one warning shot for two monkeys.</p><p>With these two incidents, I could eat you alive for a lifetime!</p><p>“Can we talk business now?” he looked at the golden beast mask on the Water Ghost’s face, saying:</p><p>“Palace Master Bai Zhou may not cozy up to the Saint Servant, but he’s about to get cozy with the First Pavilion in the Sky.”</p><p>“You find her, you tell her, Greedy the Cat Spirit has already signed a contract with me, the process was perfect.”</p><p>“If Xu Yue Grey Palace still wants support, I, Xu Xiaoshou, am their best choice, whether it’s the war faction or the conservative faction, they should get close to me, whether it’s human or ghost beast form, I have it all.”</p><p>“In a word, first come, first served.”</p><p>After hearing Xu Xiaoshou’s implicitly suggestive words, the Water Ghost fell silent again, “He won’t trust me, I’m a Saint Servant.”</p><p>“You’re not one now.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou unilaterally declared the Water Ghost freed, passing over a command token, “From now on, you are the Chief Elder of my First Pavilion in the Sky!”</p><p>Gugu….</p><p>The Water Ghost fell silent, a few bubbles popping above his head.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Xu Xiaoshou tilted his head, “Don’t like Chief Elder? Then let’s change it… guardian? guest elder? Or Supreme Elder? You choose.”</p><p>“Chief Elder it is.”</p><p>The Water Ghost accepted the command token, giving up the struggle.</p><p>The palm-sized token, very exquisite, had a dragon apricot carved on the front and a nine-story pavilion through the clouds on the back.</p><p>But it bore no mark of “Water Ghost”; it was clearly mass-produced, not personalized.</p><p>But speaking of mass-produced goods…</p><p>The Water Ghost could clearly sense that inside there was a set of spatial coordinates; with a mere infusion of spiritual senses, one could traverse space and arrive at another world.</p><p>His Apricot Realm?</p><p>“Make do with it for now,” Xu Xiaoshou chuckled, “Go on, it’s been tough.”</p><p>The Water Ghost pocketed the command token but didn’t immediately leave. Instead, he turned to greet Yue Gongli, who had quietly listened to the whole affair, unable to prevent it:</p><p>“Long time no see, Young Master Gong Li.”</p><p>As Yue Gongli continued to concentrate on controlling the Yin Coffin in an attempt to stay away from the Saint Servant Cen Qiaofu, and hoping the Water Ghost would get killed halfway back by the Di Ying Holy Plant, he replied snidely upon hearing this:</p><p>“Times have changed, things have transformed beyond recognition.”</p><p>“That proud Great Demon King Yu Mo of the past, who looked down on even the Saint Servant, how has he now stooped so low, content to be a lackey for the First Pavilion in the Sky?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quirked an eyebrow but remained unangered, only smiling and stroking his chin while watching the two clash.</p><p>They knew each other?</p><p>Of course, one was the most unruly and arrogant talent of the Spirit Division back in the day, and the other a young master from a demi-saint aristocratic family who loved to play around. They must have crossed paths.</p><p>Fight! Come on, fight!</p><p>The Water Ghost wasn’t actually going to conflict with Yue Gongli.</p><p>He merely came to say hello, and after glancing over the lidless coffin and the sunk Six Marrow Corpse King, he said calmly:</p><p>“Play less with coffins.”</p><p>“And play less with yin corpses.”</p><p>“Be careful your big sister doesn’t whip your ass again.”</p><p>Yue Gongli’s face changed drastically as he shifted his gaze nervously to Xu Xiaoshou and then cursed loudly, “What nonsense are you spouting with your crazy talk!”</p><p>The Water Ghost chuckled.</p><p>Chi Chi…</p><p>He turned into vapor and disappeared.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou moved closer with interest, like a monkey searching in a melon field, “A whip? What whip?”</p><p>Yue Gongli’s eyes narrowed to slits with fury: “He’s just sure that I wouldn’t dare to strike, if it were the Central Region, his demi-saint incarnation wouldn’t survive today, he wouldn’t get away!”</p><p>“So what about the whip?”</p><p>“Yu Mo is a Saint Servant, isn’t he? He doesn’t even listen much to Bazhun’an, so why does he listen to you?”</p><p>“So what about the whip?”</p><p>“Are you two close?”</p><p>“Whip…”</p><p>“Shut up!” Yue Gongli suddenly raged, spinning around with his finger pointed at the young man’s forehead, “I warn you, Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
