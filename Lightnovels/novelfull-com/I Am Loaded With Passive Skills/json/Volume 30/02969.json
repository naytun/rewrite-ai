Yue Gongli is not bad, he should be able to soon figure out a method, but the cost…”</p><p>The cost, naturally, is extremely high.</p><p>But tonight, the Son of the Holy Divine Palace is footing the bill for everyone here, while Saint Servants and the rest can just sit back and wait to benefit from it.</p><p>Elder Sang watched for a while, lost interest, and then lowered his head to look at Xu Xiaoshou:</p><p>“Are you confident?”</p><p>…</p><p>“Body Dao Disc (38%).”</p><p>With the first Profound Dao Seed planted, a progress bar appeared behind the Body Dao Disc.</p><p>With just a glance, Xu Xiaoshou laughed out loud. The initial 31% of the Body Dao Disc certainly could never be a comprehensive disc like the Way of the Sword Disc that encapsulated all things.</p><p>It seems…</p><p>The Body Dao Disc is the Body Dao Disc.</p><p>The ancient martial arts disc is the ancient martial arts disc.</p><p>The two are linked, but not much so, and even if the Body Dao Disc reaches 90%, it might gain even more than from the ancient martial arts, but it still needs to rely on something else to involve the “Four Sacrifice.”</p><p>“Let’s give it a try!”</p><p>Answering Elder Sang, Xu Xiaoshou hesitated no longer and closed his eyes completely, beginning to plant Profound Dao Seeds in the Field of Profound Dao, waiting for them to blossom and bear fruit to nourish himself.</p><p>“Body Dao Disc (42%).”</p><p>“Body Dao Disc (54%).”</p><p>“…”</p><p>One Profound Dao Seed after another was planted, and Xu Xiaoshou became a happy farmer with every plant bringing a harvest, oh how splendid!</p><p>Until the last…</p><p>“Passive Points: 13,624,449.”</p><p>“Body Dao Disc (80%).”</p><p>Hum!</p><p>A dazzling array diagram extended outwards in all directions, stealing the focus of all eyes around.</p><p>“Did he really do it?”</p><p>The higher void, demi-saints, and those indulged in the Upanishad of physique were few and far between.</p><p>The remaining ones who quickly snapped back to their senses were all dumbstruck.</p><p>In this place, most people had never witnessed Xu Xiaoshou’s creation of three great Upanishads outside Jade Capital City.</p><p>In their minds, the only person capable of such abnormal comprehension abilities, able to realize Enlightenment upon sitting down, was only one person…</p><p>Kui Leihan!</p><p>And now, Xu Xiaoshou had almost exactly replicated Kui Leihan’s path from those days.</p><p>He wasn’t even contemplating the elusive Penetrating Divine Senses for everyone witnessed, but rather, that very Spiritual Cultivation Upanishad everyone longed to touch but could never reach—how much more despicable!</p><p>The Water Ghost clicked his tongue in wonder.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s gaze went blank.</p><p>Elder Sang glanced at it and then was filled with mixed emotions.</p><p>He now understood that odd look Xu Xiaoshou gave him before, and what it meant.</p><p>This guy, can he have whatever he wants?</p><p>Then, what about the Fire Upanishad?</p><p>“Lord Shou has broken through! Lord Shou has broken through!”</p><p>“What Upanishad is this? My heavens…”</p><p>Spiritual Cultivators who stayed to witness the miracle of ascension never expected that before they could see the ascension, they would witness the creation of another legend by Lord Shou.</p><p>Soon everyone’s eyes turned to the Holy Divine Palace folks still trying to climb the pillar, noticing that everyone there got stuck on the pillar.</p><p>They turned their heads one after another, their faces appearing as if they’d swallowed flies, extremely ugly.</p><p>“No way, he actually did it?”</p><p>“This array diagram, why have I never seen it before?”</p><p>“I think I’ve seen it before. Back in the Qilin Realm, when Lord Shou was learning the Six Paths of ancient martial arts… hiss, I forgot what it was?”</p><p>Murmurs from the crowd below fluttered through the heart like a willow’s touch, making Yue Gongli struggle with his thoughts.</p><p>Compared to someone else’s flashy array diagram…</p><p>The people of the Holy Divine Palace, embarrassingly climbing the pillar like apes this moment, looked truly hideous—mere embarrassment didn’t suffice to describe it.</p><p>“Out of the way!”</p><p>Yue Gongli swept the climbing apes aside, gathered the Life Star back to him, and concentrated the power of the evil god in his palm.</p><p>Time is up!</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou succeeds, it will be too hard for the Holy Divine Palace to overturn the situation.</p><p>Since the Di Ying Holy Plant has undergone demonic transformation and mainly cultivates the power of the evil god, then…</p><p>“Smack!”</p><p>Without a second thought, Yue Gongli slapped his hand on the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar.</p><p>A demon?</p><p>Come on! Let’s see who dares to gamble with their life!</p><p>…</p><p>“Hum!”</p><p>An unusual sound seemed to echo from all directions, as if it emanated from deep within the soul.</p><p>His body felt as if it was merging with the Great Path, yet it seemed as if the Great Path was merely an extension of his body—nothing more.</p><p>Digesting the layers of understanding related to the physique, Xu Xiaoshou still felt lucid, now overwhelmed with joy:</p><p>He didn’t have that feeling of ‘dying with the heavens’ that came with breakthroughs on the Shengshen Continent!</p><p>The Divine Ruins, holding together the remnants of the God State, was indeed as legendary as its reputation!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
