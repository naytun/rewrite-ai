If you want it, just come and beg your big sister~”</p><p>She gently tilted her head, a serene smile on her face as she extended her finger and gently tapped the handsome young man’s forehead, giving a slight push forward.</p><p>In the past, no matter which Saint it was, even if it was Taizai Ci at their first meeting, they would be caught off guard by her move, forcefully taken, and by the time they regained consciousness, it was already underway, irretrievable.</p><p>And this little guy isn’t even a demi-saint…</p><p>Strong physique? Great, but Locust Poison, from the inside out, is as difficult to remove as a ghost beast host body—what good is a strong body!</p><p>Strong Sword Will? It doesn’t solve the practical issues at all; ancient swordsmen are all useless, physically weak, and pathetic!</p><p>Strong Penetrating Divine Senses?</p><p>Strong power of the ancestral source?</p><p>What even are these things!</p><p>Such ethereal and insubstantial stuff, good for killing enemies, but for self-defense, only those who have mastered the Power of Medicine Ancestor might give it a shot.</p><p>“Lord Shou?”</p><p>“Heh, just the insignificant Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>Lady Serpent only needed a small trick, and it was as if she could see this renowned junior, helplessly prostrating under her skirts, eventually disgraced, covering his face, and weeping.</p><p>She pushed her finger forward, her gaze already shifting downwards, her long forked tongue licking her red lips, her saliva sizzling as it corroded the void.</p><p>“I heard, you can ‘produce thousands of children all on your own’?”</p><p>“Come on then, let me, let you, experience the true pleasure of the Feather Ascension Immortal Realm… Eh?”</p><p>The voice filled with hunger and thirst came to an abrupt halt as Lady Serpent’s face flashed with disbelief.</p><p>Before her, Xu Xiaoshou’s body shook, and beneath his feet, a Life Dao Disc materialized. From his pores, a surge of Life Force mist spouted out, tinged with the dark purple of Locust Poison.</p><p>“How is this possible?”</p><p>Lady Serpent exclaimed in shock, “Locust Poison has merged with your body, how can you possibly locate it so precisely?”</p><p>It’s useless!</p><p>Even if you find it, it’s useless!</p><p>Once poisoned, the Locust Poison becomes part of your spiritual source, holy essence, blood, and flesh; just ejecting a little bit is far from enough!</p><p>“Whoosh~~~”</p><p>Lady Serpent once again exhaled a breath as she spouted a mouthful of mist, enveloping Xu Xiaoshou in an instant.</p><p>He’s not resisting?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t budge, as if truly unable to move!</p><p>Lady Serpent intuitively felt something was wrong. This clearly looked like the weakness from poisoning, but his reaction made one’s hair stand on end, as if he was doing it on purpose?</p><p>Back away?</p><p>It was impossible to back away!</p><p>Today, she must claim this vigorous young man and savor the process of subduing him!</p><p>“Whoosh~~~”</p><p>Another breath of Locust Poison was expelled, and Xu Xiaoshou, appearing to be in a befuddled state, suddenly opened his eyes, a sharp light bursting forth:</p><p>“Are you done?”</p><p>Swish!</p><p>That pervasive Locust Poison had indeed seeped into Xu Xiaoshou’s body, but in an instant, it disappeared as if into a bottomless pit.</p><p>Lady Serpent’s expression finally turned to one of fright.</p><p>She could no longer sense even a trace of her own poisonous power within Xu Xiaoshou’s body!</p><p>“How is this possible?”</p><p>“How could this be done?”</p><p>Upon hearing this, the corners of Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth just curled.</p><p>Indeed, Locust Poison was unparalleled; if not immediately devoured by the Engulfing Power, even transformation and Eternal Vitality would take half a day to get rid of.</p><p>But sorry, there are two power centers in my body—I’ll admit you’re strong if you’ve broken my energy reserve, but that won’t stop me from opening the Dragon Pearl!</p><p>With the Dragon Pearl opened, its stored power could be borrowed.</p><p>Then, using the Life Upanishad to draw out, all the life energy that had been poisoned was extracted and thrown into the Dragon Pearl.</p><p>I am still me.</p><p>I am no longer the me of before.</p><p>“You’ve got something, but not much.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly awoke, his eyes sharp.</p><p>Heart Sword Technique, Present Gods and Buddhas!</p><p>Not to be looked at directly… Lady Serpent knew ancient swordsmen too well and, feeling it instinctually, she averted her gaze right away.</p><p>However, beneath Xu Xiaoshou’s feet bloomed the Will Dao Disc:</p><p>“Look at me, you wretch!”</p><p>Boom—</p><p>In that instant, Lady Serpent felt as if her head had been struck by a heavy hammer. Numbly receiving the Guidance, she turned to look.</p><p>Oh no!</p><p>The power of guidance!</p><p>How did Xu Xiaoshou come to possess Taizai Ci’s power of guidance, which was only supposed to belong to a Holy Emperor?</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>As her thoughts shifted in this manner, and the darkness before her eyes gave way, Lady Serpent felt the world spinning around her.</p><p>“Withering Snow of the West Wind.”</p><p>The voice arrived, and on reflex, a scan from her saint’s will.</p><p>Below the source of the sound, she could see the young man in black slowly sheathing his sword behind the headless body. The fierce devil power of the Fourth Sword quickly concealed its edge, and with a “click,” it retreated into the scabbard.</p><p>Chi Chi Chi…</p><p>Thick blood, soon accompanied by the aura of the Fourth Sword’s fierce devil power, gushed from the severed neck, drowning out the desperate screams that reached the Nine Heavens:</p><p>“No!!!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
