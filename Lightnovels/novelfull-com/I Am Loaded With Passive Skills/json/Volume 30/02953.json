Boom! Boom!”</p><p>Each strike was like a heavy hammer rhythmically smashing his wounded soul onto an anvil, crushing it into a pulp.</p><p>But to actually perish and die in this state, what a blissful and wonderful thing that would be!</p><p>When Elder Sang came back to his senses, he found himself still alive, his body healthier than anyone present except Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“Ergh…”</p><p>He finally let out a noise, not quite human speech, perhaps a sigh or some other indistinct sound.</p><p>—Some people are alive, but he had already died.</p><p>…</p><p>“I…”</p><p>His lips quivered.</p><p>The one who ties the bell must untie it.</p><p>Elder Sang had seen the world, and he knew that to break this awkward situation, he had to speak up.</p><p>Reliant on Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>The sky could fall, and he would wait for everyone to die before he took action!</p><p>This “action” would most likely be adding insult to injury with another mocking remark.</p><p>Yet, in his glorious past at Fen Qin or commanding respect everywhere in Sleeveless Saint Servant, Elder Sang truly had no idea how to turn the situation around at this moment.</p><p>His mind whirled endlessly, returning always to Xu Xiaoshou, always to “calling Master.”</p><p>“You?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou repeated the word, smiling as he looked at old man Sang, pitifully low to the ground, deliberately refusing to give him an out, pushing him toward a corner, and even highlighting it:</p><p>“Stop digging your toes first, a three-room flat has already appeared.”</p><p>Swish, swish, swish…</p><p>All eyes followed Lord Shou’s chin and gaze, staring at those embarrassingly overwhelmed toes.</p><p>Quiet.</p><p>Still quiet.</p><p>Quietly drawn and quartered, quietly sliced into a thousand pieces—this was far more excessive than a quick beheading!</p><p>Elder Sang’s body jerked violently, his charred toes curling up quickly like shy mimosa, wishing they could withdraw into his bones.</p><p>“You!”</p><p>He lifted his head, looking at that traitor.</p><p>All astonishment and awkwardness were swiftly liberated, transforming into endless killing intent.</p><p>The killing intent could no longer be restrained; this charred, rotten man, like a fierce beast pushed into the soil trying desperately to leap up for a final counterattack, even wished he could slaughter everyone who witnessed this scene.</p><p>But he couldn’t kill them all…</p><p>Water Ghost, Cen Qiaofu, they were all here, and it was impossible to eliminate them.</p><p>This affair had become a nail that couldn’t be pulled out, pinning Sang Qiye firmly to a pillar of shame!</p><p>“I?”</p><p>I, Lord Shou!</p><p>I’ll be afraid of you?</p><p>Across him, Xu Xiaoshou completely discarded his brain, not retreating but counterattacking, casually said:</p><p>“And I, your newly revered master, Xu Xiaoshou of Sang Qiye.”</p><p>Sizzle…</p><p>All around, people gasped in surprise.</p><p>Even Water Ghost, Yue Gongli, and others instinctively stepped back.</p><p>Compared to a lavender-striped underwear exhibition, Sang Qiye was no longer livable; why should I care about this? Water Ghost thought so.</p><p>Compared to publicly slicing open my stomach to gain fame across the five regions, I just need to expose this sleeveless matter too. It can’t be said to be more outrageous than mine, so you die, I get hurt… Yue Gongli had already found a coping strategy; if unable to deal with Xu Xiaoshou, then target his master.</p><p>“That’s too cruel!”</p><p>All the onlookers had already started to withdraw.</p><p>Lord Shou was not just cruel, this was annihilation, far beyond mere cruelty.</p><p>He was like holding a person in his embrace, arms hooked under their knees, placing them on a scorching stove, eager to see the person expose their most mortifying parts while also letting that huge mess drop in front of everyone with a splat.</p><p>That’s fine for a child!</p><p>But this was a mature, even “famous” adult!</p><p>This heart punishment was crueler than murder; while a tiger does not eat its cub, he was your… er, master, how could it come to this?</p><p>…</p><p>It had to.</p><p>To Xu Xiaoshou, Elder Sang was both a master and friend, both a buddy and enemy.</p><p>It was this man who had dragged him into the filthy politics of the Spiritual Cultivators, and it was he who had opened the door to a new and mysterious world.</p><p>He should be thankful.</p><p>But it was all forced!</p><p>He should hold a grudge.</p><p>But he had taken precautions behind the scenes!</p><p>He should let go.</p><p>But he laid death traps under his feet time and again, never giving him even a moment to breathe!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
