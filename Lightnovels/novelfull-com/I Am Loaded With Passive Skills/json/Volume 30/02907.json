Lord Shou, stop!” The Raging Giant fell into a pause during a variation, and Yue Gongli, still unaware, took the opportunity to cry out, “Give me a chance, let me come out first…”</p><p>Boom bang boom bang boom bang boom bang…</p><p>The calm before the storm ended, and the climax of explosive sobs officially descended!</p><p>Beneath the shimmering white flame light of the Dragon Melting Realm, the golden giant’s horse stance dug into the earth, and its upper body rapidly flickered left and right, creating afterimages.</p><p>Its seemingly cumbersome body and incredibly thick arms forcefully made the Yin Coffin vanish into nothingness, swinging violently like an aggressive pendulum from side to side.</p><p>“Splash.”</p><p>Below the Dragon Melting Realm, someone turned pale and fell to the ground.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>Zhou Tianshen tilted his head, instinctively attempting to help the person up before remembering this person was part of the pursuing army and immediately withdrew his compassion.</p><p>“A person from the Holy Divine Palace, right?” A sharp-faced man next to him glanced sideways and laughed:</p><p>“If you’re scared, go and cut your throat. It’s the quickest way to die and you can report back to your Lord Cang Sheng.”</p><p>“If you end up in Lord Shou’s hands, consider yourself lucky if you die from one strike, but if your physique turns out to be tougher and your defense stronger…”</p><p>He pointed at the far-off Raging Giant’s toy-like coffin, his mouth twisting into a grimace:</p><p>“This will be your end!”</p><p>…</p><p>Sandwiched within the crowd, an ordinary-looking man of average height and cultivation level glanced back at the speaker, then looked beyond the Dragon Melting Realm, silently withdrawing his gaze to observe the battlefield.</p><p>He clearly didn’t say anything.</p><p>His expression should have been frightened, shocked, simply going with the flow.</p><p>Having endured to this point, he even lacked the will to run, careful not to make any unnecessary moves.</p><p>Just one curious glance…</p><p>Just one glance!</p><p>“Whoosh.”</p><p>A gust of wind struck his face.</p><p>Time slowed in that moment.</p><p>Dust swirled around him, as everyone, including the rotund Zhou Tianshen and the untouchable bag of God Fated Star, “howled” and took off again…</p><p>Golden!</p><p>Filled his vision!</p><p>The giant, coming from afar, swung the Yin Coffin around in a mighty arc, and with the force that could cleave the sacred mountain, harshly brought down that plaything of terrifying hardness onto his own face:</p><p>“Watching what the hell!”</p><p>“What you see outside the Dragon Melting Realm, Yue Gongli can see, you bunch of nobodies can also see?!”</p><p>Thud.</p><p>In an instant, Nian’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou attacking Yue Gongli was a ruse, his real focus was on everyone’s actions in the arena?</p><p>The death he meted out outside the Dragon Melting Realm to that “Nian” was false, a calculated setup was the truth?</p><p>Wildly swinging the coffin was a gesture of venting anger, the resolve for revenge that this night must fulfill was the truth?</p><p>The unexpected space teleportation…</p><p>The head-on strike with the Yin Coffin…</p><p>Everything came so abruptly.</p><p>Nian stepped forward instantly, not only reacting in time but also disappearing from the spot.</p><p>“Shadow Piercing Spirit!”</p><p>As the golden light approached, this ordinary passerby among the crowd, under the astonished gaze of those around him, drew the Memory Returning Dagger, appearing behind the Golden Giant’s head…</p><p>A single strike!</p><p>“Holy Soul Annihilation!”</p><p>An illusionary, ancient, and massive shadow of the Holy God coalesced behind him before shattering into a surge of energy.</p><p>The terrifying Power of Divinity infused his body, and even Nian’s calm, indifferent eyes couldn’t help but brim with pain.</p><p>Yet he was determined to trade it for an even more lethal strike!</p><p>“Swoosh!”</p><p>By then, even the dimmest among the crowd, except for Zhou Tianshen, had realized what was happening.</p><p>The previous silent strike, if unsuccessful, allowed for an escape.</p><p>Lord Shou didn’t let anyone escape; he realized what was happening and crushed that “Nian” to death.</p><p>But Nian should have known Lord Shou inside out. That “Nian” who came out of the Dragon Melting Realm to die was probably just a pitiful creature from the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>The now vocal strike, a desperate back-against-the-wall fight.</p><p>The abruptly manifested shadow of the Ancestral God, that formidable, terrifying Power of Divinity, all channeled into one of the nine supreme divine weapons, the Memory Returning Dagger, transformed into a soul-targeting fatal blow…</p><p>Lord Shou, blocked it?</p><p>“…Stop!”</p><p>Only then, as if choked by a mouthful of blood, the delayed cry of alarm from inside the Yin Coffin finally came tardily.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The giant’s hand slammed the large coffin onto the ground.</p><p>The arising dust, along with the surge of force, instantly blew the people nearby away, shattering them.</p><p>“Whoa…”</p><p>Zhou Tianshen dived forward, grabbing the God Fated Star, and barely managed to protect himself by activating its internal power.</p><p>Those who were closer and had life-saving methods withstood the shockwave.</p><p>Those who didn’t were instantly turned into starlight, forever losing their chance to pursue the heritage of the divine priest.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Zhou Tianshen didn’t care for others but turned around and shouted.</p><p>Since the Yin Coffin was slammed down and Nian had escaped beforehand, with the giant Xu Xiaoshou missing the actual target, was he not…</p><p>Exposed?</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>Without any reservation!</p><p>The Memory Returning Dagger forcefully penetrated through the Raging Giant’s head, overcoming numerous barriers, creating a through and through.</p><p>Nian’s body, even due to the inertia of exerting all his strength, moved from behind the giant’s head to the front, finally crashing heavily onto the lid of the Yin Coffin, fracturing his arms.</p><p>“Thud!”</p><p>The coffin shook.</p><p>The deep sigh from within, accompanied by the sound of coughing up blood, came out:</p><p>“You shouldn’t have struck…”</p><p>“He’s wary, he’s unwary, those are two different people.”</p><p>Everything fell silent.</p><p>Dead silence!</p><p>Zhou Tianshen blankly gazed at the Golden Giant whose head had been pierced through and then at the injured Nian…</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
