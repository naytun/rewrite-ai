It was my turn next.”</p><p>“Cheng Lao!!”</p><p>“No.” The youth Xiaoran was adamant, “Lord Li, next up is me. I will perfectly complete the mission. Do you have any message for my older siblings?”</p><p>Li Fugui fell silent for a moment, his eyes slightly narrowed, calmly said:</p><p>“Find them, tell them, no need to try and come out. Go find Lord Shou…”</p><p>Pausing, Li Fugui cleared his thoughts:</p><p>“Lord Shou is at the eye of the storm, there’s no need to go there anymore. Go find Lord Sleeveless or Lord Water Ghost, they will take care of you.”</p><p>“Tell those two Lords that the God-Slayer’s Ruins might not be the God-Slayer’s Ruins anymore.”</p><p>“Lastly, take good care of yourself.”</p><p>Just as Xiaoran was about to speak, Li Fugui interrupted, “Do you have any wishes?”</p><p>At the Information Department of Mu Zili, everyone’s expression dimmed.</p><p>Li Fugui spoke again, “Or maybe your family…”</p><p>“Lord Li, you forgot, I am an orphan.”</p><p>Xiaoran smiled, “My wish is to protect Lord Li.”</p><p>“…Ran Ming.”</p><p>Swish!</p><p>The figure disappeared.</p><p>At the Information Department of Mu Zili, a deep silence settled in.</p><p>How could Lord Li forget you’re an orphan? Lord Li was just… Li Fugui was heavily burdened in his thoughts. After a long while, he raised a hand and indifferently said:</p><p>“Continue on…”</p><p>“No, halt the operation, no more entries!”</p><p>He turned his head towards the direction of the Crystal Palace. Lord Shou was still there, these matters must be reported immediately!</p><p>“You coordinate with Flower Pavilion and Valley of Floral Fragrance for confirmed information, I’ll go to find Lord Shou…”</p><p>“Don’t worry, we still have Lord Shou!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Lord Shou, quickly think of something, I’m going to crumble!”</p><p>In the Divine Relics, Yue Gongli was running and shrieking in a world of complete darkness.</p><p>He couldn’t even find a way out of the darkness, but he couldn’t stop running either.</p><p>Because once he stopped, those branches from the entity called “Mother of the World,” a bizarre Di Ying Holy Plant, would certainly impale him through and turn him into a dried corpse!</p><p>Power of the Ancestral Source…</p><p>Yes, Yue Gongli felt a strong power of the evil god from the towering Ancestral Tree behind him!</p><p>The concentration was almost comparable to the half-portion of the most primal Power of Divinity preserved in the Holy Divine Palace!</p><p>Without a doubt…</p><p>There was a problem!</p><p>A problem erupted at Ran Ming Ruins!</p><p>Di Ying Holy Plant also had a problem!</p><p>There was no time to ponder over what the problem was or solve it, that wasn’t too significant.</p><p>What mattered was, in this First Heaven of the Divine Relics’ Three Heavens, such a terrifying creature appeared, something that shouldn’t have been here…</p><p>Matching the Holy Emperor, perhaps even surpassing it!</p><p>This wasn’t a trial for people, this was meant to kill all trial-takers!</p><p>“Lord Shou, save me—”</p><p>“At least, don’t run so fast, whimper whimper…”</p><p>Yue Gongli lamented sorrowfully. He had long legs, but they weren’t longer than Xu Xiaoshou with space attributes; he was left hanging ten body lengths behind.</p><p>As for why it was only ten body lengths and not further, or why not run faster?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wanted to as well!</p><p>But damn it, once he exceeded a distance, branches from the Di Ying Holy Plant, which sprung out from who knows where, would whip towards him again!</p><p>He didn’t even know how many times he had been whipped away.</p><p>His passive skill at Holy Emperor Level 0, being whipped back and forth like a toy.</p><p>This cursed thing was more terrifying than all the enemies he had encountered before—more terrifying than Rao Wangze’s thought incarnation, more terrifying than Bei Huai’s will of the Holy Emperor!</p><p>“The Holy Emperor’s Original Body!”</p><p>“Even an unrestricted High Realm Holy Emperor’s Original Body!”</p><p>Without a doubt, Xu Xiaoshou had made such a conjecture, and from the panic shown by the well-experienced Yue Gongli, hints could be seen.</p><p>He was dragging Yue Gongli along not because that was the fastest he could go.</p><p>But because…</p><p>In the face of disaster, you don’t need to outrun everyone; you just need to outrun your companion next to you.</p><p>“You give the Dao Infant to her!” Xu Xiaoshou was also shouting while running, “She wants it, just give it to her, how many times do I have to tell you!”</p><p>“That’s my child, Xu Xiaoshou, if it were you, would you give it to her?”</p><p>“You’re farting, I, Xu Mengshou, have a head that can touch the sky and feet that can stand on earth, if it were me, I wouldn’t have given birth to it at all!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou you…”</p><p>“Don’t whine at me! Your belly was impregnated by her, the child also has a part of her effort, what’s wrong if she wants a hug? What’s the harm if you give it to her!”</p><p>“Is this a matter of just a hug? Oh, how sweet, how cute… She will eat it! My Lord Shou!”</p><p>“Then let her eat it!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, are you crazy? My Dao Infant perfectly balances the Power of Divinity, Heavenly Ancestor, and evil god. Give it to her? She would transform on the spot, ascend to godhood and claim ancestry, let me tell you!”</p><p>“If your Dao Infant is so fierce, why are you still running? Turn around and fight her now, from now on I won’t call you Moon Fox, I’ll call you big brother, I’ll let Bazhun’an call you big brother too!”</p><p>“Are you sick? My Dao Infant is my Dao Infant, I am me, I still can’t balance the Power of Three Ancestors well…”</p><p>“You trash, just shut up!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I advise you not to curse… Ah, not allowed, cannot be, ugh—gulp!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Following a sound of blood spewing, an explosion sounded.</p><p>A terrifying shockwave instantly shattered the Path Principles, time seemed to slow down at that moment…</p><p>On the left, as the battered body of the Six Marrow Corpse King flew past him, just over his shoulder, only a face with the Heart of Marrow Absorption made an unintelligent, painless sound:</p><p>“Ho?”</p><p>On the right, Yue Gongli, covered in blood and his clothes in tatters, also swiftly spiraled by, managing to squeeze out a smile from his agony, said in a bizarre tone:</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>1 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p><p>1</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
