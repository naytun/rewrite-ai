His now intensified senses, however, locked onto a black stick image descending from the sky!</p><p>It was bigger than Feiyi, striking right at the vital seven inches.</p><p>Descending from behind the bald man, it was like a sword image, like the shadow of the Ancestral God.</p><p>“Thud.”</p><p>“Gurgle gurgle…”</p><p>The Feiyi disappeared.</p><p>The human figure returned.</p><p>Changyi’s head dropped to the ground, rolling forward two body lengths.</p><p>The headless corpse thudded onto the ground, the blood merging into the stream, happily staining the riverbank red.</p><p>“Thud.”</p><p>The scalding golden crown long stick stopped sloping in front of his eyes, and the head bounced twice on the ground like a ball.</p><p>Changyi’s expression became blank, and he recognized it.</p><p>One of the nine supreme divine weapons, and one of the few that could rank on the Heavy Weapon List like the Shattered Shield—a weapon—the Overlord!</p><p>So…</p><p>Is he The Divine?</p><p>What about that Ten High Nobles nonsense?</p><p>I heard they are the strongest ten people in recent times, but aren’t they from the younger generation?</p><p>Is the younger generation this strong now?</p><p>The leader of the Banquet also cultivates his physique, no, he transforms his physique. With his ability, if he came, he could withstand one stick… perhaps?</p><p>The Divine flicked away the Overlord, which turned into a black dot and vanished. Squatting down, he looked at the head on the ground:</p><p>“A bit of substance, but not much.”</p><p>Fuck your mom!</p><p>I fuck your grandpa!</p><p>You have the guts to stand there and let me chop you once, see if I don’t cleave you to death. Only covert attacks, what kind of good… man…</p><p>Was it really a covert attack?</p><p>Changyi despairingly closed his eyes.</p><p>He had come to understand everything; The Divine’s hostility was not hidden either, quite generously wanting to end him.</p><p>One could say his battle consciousness was no weaker than that of the opponent, but even after realizing it, what then?</p><p>One stick!</p><p>What about the Northern Region Seven Stars…</p><p>What about the demi-saint War Madman…</p><p>Changyi laughed, a wretched laugh, silent tears mixed with blood sliding down from his nose.</p><p>A stick, knocked the shit right out of me!</p><p>I seriously doubted that my demi-saint position had cracked open!</p><p>Oh…</p><p>I still have a demi-saint position, huh?</p><p>Me, a demi-saint?</p><p>I’m just a piece of trash! A complete worthless dog!</p><p>“Deng Kou, Dun Ling, my brothers… let them go… kill me…”</p><p>Changyi didn’t want to live anymore.</p><p>He no longer wanted to ask why the conflict started; he had no right to.</p><p>The rules of the frontline battlefield were such: you win, you have the right to speak; you lose, you are nothing.</p><p>“Hey!”</p><p>The Divine Force smacked this head with a heavy slap.</p><p>Every person defeated by him felt this way—heart as dead as ashes, as if there’s nothing in the world worth longing for.</p><p>From thirty years ago until now, in every battle, the defeated all felt this; The Divine himself didn’t know why.</p><p>Lose?</p><p>He’d lost when he was young too?</p><p>As a child, he couldn’t outpunch the kid next door, got his head beaten bloody, and went home to bandage the wounds in a corner by himself.</p><p>But he trained! Just trained and hit back!</p><p>Beat their heads to a pulp, and they knew better than to dare!</p><p>What does it mean to lose confidence—the thing men fear most is losing their self-confidence.</p><p>But…</p><p>Strict with oneself, lenient with others.</p><p>The Divine wouldn’t force anyone. He would only offer a symbolic word of encouragement, as long as the person could survive:</p><p>“Get a grip, at least you’re not dead, you took one of my sticks.”</p><p>Changyi spat out a mouthful of blood and fell silent completely.</p><p>The person was still decent, remembering his brothers even at death’s door… The Divine instead muttered to himself:</p><p>“The one with the lantern is Deng Kou, and the one with the shield is Dun Ling, right?”</p><p>“I came across them on the way. The power of guidance of the Holy Emperor’s will was guiding them, all of you, running in this direction.”</p><p>“I met six demi-saints, all just like that, none of them realized it.”</p><p>The power of the Holy Emperor’s guidance?</p><p>Changyi’s eyes flew open, and a streak of astonishment flitted through the blurry, blood-colored world.</p><p>He had not realized it either.</p><p>The Divine continued, “So, I kindly asked them to stop…”</p><p>“Cough!” Changyi coughed up a mouthful of blood, “How did you… call them, my brothers… are not… violent, they wouldn’t… have a conflict… with you…”</p><p>The Divine tilted his head and snorted, “In a rush to be reincarnated? Those six demi-saints I helped stop, and even then, you wouldn’t believe in it?”</p><p>“Pfft.” Changyi spat out some blood, closed his eyes, and had enough.</p><p>The Divine shrugged his shoulders, sat down on the spot, grabbed a head, and jammed it onto Changyi’s bleeding neck, “You know, they called me trash…”</p><p>He didn’t have many elixirs. He crushed half a Little Rejuvenation Pill, saved the other half, and then smeared the powder on Changyi’s severed neck wound:</p><p>“No need to say more, whoever has the bigger fist has the right to call people trash.”</p><p>“Moreover, I have some questions too; it’s better if everyone stays calm so that we can have a good talk.”</p><p>After waiting for the person to get a bit better, The Divine finally asked his purpose for coming here:</p><p>“Why have so many demi-saints suddenly come in?”</p><p>“Are you all rushing in that direction because of Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Yes, The Divine also had the Ancestral God Ranking in his palm and could know Xu Xiaoshou’s current location with a thought.</p><p>The Dark Forest’s rules for sustaining life were quite miraculous, originally the best place for comprehending the Human Realm Dao.</p><p>However, with the power of the evil god scattered everywhere and the guidance of the Holy Emperor’s will causing trickery, it’s not a place to stay for long.</p><p>And yet, these fools rushed headlong into it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could be forgiven, probably having his own thoughts, but what were these demi-saints plotting?</p><p>Hearing that, Changyi was stunned for a moment and said:</p><p>“It’s an Invitation to Saint.”</p><p>“But we came in just for fun, we didn’t plan to kill Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>It was the guidance!</p><p>The Holy Emperor’s guidance, directing all the demi-saints towards that forest?</p><p>Changyi was suddenly alert and then thought, could it be that even the many demi-saints entering the ruins and the issuance of the Invitation to Saint were guided?</p><p>“Just for fun?”</p><p>The Divine, however, didn’t share Changyi’s shock, chuckled as he pulled something from his chest, took out a crystal gemstone, and said with a chuckle:</p><p>“It’s not as simple as just fun now.”</p><p>“When I was stopping people, I accidentally killed one.”</p><p>“He should have been a demi-saint in his own right, not an incarnation, this thing came out with the shit and piss, just got punched out of him.”</p><p>Changyi’s pupils dilated as he stared at that dazzling crystal gemstone, dumbfounded.</p><p>A demi-saint position?!</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
