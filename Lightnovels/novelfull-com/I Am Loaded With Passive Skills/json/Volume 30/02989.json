For Elder Sang’s supreme saint calamity, Spatial Upanishad could also cover most of the fluctuation.</p><p>With the Will Dao Disc activated, Unity of Man and the Heavens initiated, he even started to try “Guidance”!</p><p>Guiding others that his own matters were more important, one could overlook this saint calamity fluctuation and need not hurry to attend the ceremony.</p><p>Not sure whether his own Guidance succeeded, or if the Spatial Upanishad had hidden the saint calamity well, or possibly because rarely any idlers could reach the Eighteenth Heaven.</p><p>At least, during the tribulation process, indeed no one approached.</p><p>Since no unexpected events had surprisingly occurred, the first thing Elder Sang, now sanctified, worried about naturally was also what Xu Xiaoshou had thought: their own people.</p><p>“He didn’t have any accidents either…”</p><p>“That’s not what I’m asking!” Elder Sang glared over, unconcerned with details, not overly worried, or else his hair wouldn’t have possibly fallen out so fast.</p><p>“Of course, also unable to discern any abilities, but since Greedy the Cat Spirit approves of him, he should still be considered trustworthy,” Xu Xiaoshou said nonchalantly. Should Bai Zhou cause any intentional obstruction, he had plenty of ways to punish the man, even if he had reached a demi-saint level.</p><p>Seeing this situation, the Water Ghost timely spoke up, “Compared to the First Pavilion in the Sky, and even compared to the Saint Servant, what he really doesn’t want to cooperate with should be the Holy Divine Palace… so, we really do not need to worry too much.”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu, seeing everyone had voiced their opinions, paused and also said, “Water Ghost is right.”</p><p>“Hahahaha…”</p><p>Just as they were talking, a loud laugh suddenly came from the horizon, and then Bai Zhou flew over gleefully, saying, “Old man can finally be a demi-saint now!”</p><p>See… Xu Xiaoshou turned his head and passed a look, what else could happen with such a person, isn’t this just like Zhou Tianshen, somewhat divine-like?</p><p>To put it nicely, his brain isn’t necessary.</p><p>To say it harshly, his brain might not be useful.</p><p>As soon as Bai Zhou landed, he hastily came forward, grabbed Xu Xiaoshou’s hand, and started shaking it earnestly:</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I’m truly grateful to you, I really appreciate you.”</p><p>“If it weren’t for you, old man would have to wait who knows how long for a demi-saint position on the Shengshen Continent, wait for an unattended holy site to sanctify.”</p><p>“You… um…”</p><p>After pondering for quite a while, Bai Zhou finally squeezed out what he considered a complimentary sentence: “Xu Xiaoshou, you are a good person!”</p><p>“Received thanks, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Received a compliment, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Ouch, well, you don’t necessarily have to thank me like that.</p><p>Much to his surprise and somewhat blessed, Xu Xiaoshou subtly withdrew his hand from this true body, not knowing whether it was male or female, and as he was amazed that this person could withstand his own Recoil and Sharpness damage, he patted him on the shoulder:</p><p>“Good brother, for life.”</p><p>Bai Zhou laughed heartily and grabbed the gourd, taking a big swig himself,</p><p>“Good brother, for life. Want some?”</p><p>Then he passed the gourd over.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s smile froze unnaturally as he received the gourd. It wasn’t that he couldn’t drink it.</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>The voice of Greedy the Cat Spirit screamed in his mind.</p><p>Only then did Xu Xiaoshou smell a faint scent of blood, and he couldn’t help but lower his eyes to glance at the gourd, suspiciously asking, “What’s in this…”</p><p>“Blood Wine!”</p><p>Bai Zhou laughed heartily again, “The strongest wine!”</p><p>What kind of wine is Blood Wine? Am I ignorant?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was still hesitant to drink as Greedy the Cat Spirit transferred a memory to him.</p><p>It was a large pool filled with the corpses of enormous beasts, dragons, rhinos, phoenixes, and tigers—all steeping in it. The smell of alcohol was strong and pungent, an ideal temptation for Dragon Apricot, yet even Greedy the Cat Spirit wouldn’t want to venture there.</p><p>“Uh.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou found himself unable to drink from the gourd.</p><p>He hadn’t seen such a “primitive” brewing method before. He changed the topic and chatted with Bai Zhou for a bit more, then conveniently clipped the gourd back onto him.</p><p>“Both of you achieved sanctification in just one day,” Xu Xiaoshou inquired, “In that case, why not rest and adjust for a few days and we can set off directly?”</p><p>Bai Zhou waved his hand, “No need, old man just needs the sanctification breakthrough; no need to recuperate. Old man is very strong. Right now, I just want to kill and Slaughter Saints!”</p><p>After a pause, he seemed to realize this might be inappropriate to say, looked towards Sleeveless and added, “But if he needs, waiting a few more days isn’t an issue.”</p><p>Everyone looked at Elder Sang, including Xu Xiaoshou, but Elder Sang slightly shook his head:</p><p>“The Path of Upanishad, the foundation is already rock solid, and with the high-level rules and abundant Unowned Holy Power at the Divine Relics, my spiritual source has all transformed into Holy Power. My realm has just been stabilized; we can depart anytime.”</p><p>That quick?</p><p>Water Ghost was secretly astonished.</p><p>After his own Saint Slaughter on Abyss Island, he took a long time to stabilize his Holy Power and secure his realm.</p><p>But thinking about it…</p><p>He solidified his realm on the Shengshen Continent, while Sleeveless was in the Divine Relics.</p><p>His sanctification was interfered, even by Xu Xiaoshou, while Sleeveless was protected by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>There really wasn’t a need for such comparisons… Water Ghost quietly laughed at himself. When had he become such a competitive person?</p><p>Just then, Xu Xiaoshou, rubbing his chin as if unthinkingly, muttered:</p><p>“No need to stabilize the realm, then you truly are a bit stronger than Water Ghost!”</p><p>“Fire-type Upanishad, really stronger than Water-type Upanishad? I find it hard to believe…”</p><p>Everyone nearby felt a chill run down their spine, and Water Ghost was particularly distressed, finally understanding where his change of heart came from—it was because there was a scoundrel nearby.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Elder Sang, Sleeveless Red Scorched Hand, without being polite, gave a solid knock on the head, causing Xu Xiaoshou’s head to bounce twice as if it was about to fall off.</p><p>“Ouch…” That hurt.</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Back to business!” Elder Sang was furious.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, Xu Xiaoshou sat up straight in front of Elder Sang, tying up his thick black shiny hair huffily and said:</p><p>“Alright, alright, back to business, let’s focus on the task at hand…”</p><p>He raised his palm, and the Ancestral God Ranking popped up, spiritual senses attached to names.</p><p>Soon, the location of Taizai Ci appeared, perfectly aligning with the sensed location of the God-Slaying Token.</p><p>“Let’s get to it then!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
