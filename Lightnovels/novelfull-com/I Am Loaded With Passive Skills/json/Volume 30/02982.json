How much time has passed?”</p><p>“Wait, didn’t Lord Shou mention six higher voids earlier? Why are there six demi-saints?”</p><p>“No, he only mentioned ‘six.'”</p><p>“You’re wrong, he said, ‘Rest assured, there are only six.'”</p><p>The Water Ghost’s gaze towards Xu Xiaoshou froze at that moment.</p><p>A quarter of an hour…</p><p>Even the weakest demi-saint has at least some dignity.</p><p>The Water Ghost wasn’t sure that he could take down any demi-saint within such a short amount of time.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did it, and all “six” at once!</p><p>What did this mean?</p><p>Apart from the initial time possibly needed to adapt to the abilities of a demi-saint, Xu Xiaoshou’s moves were almost instant kills!</p><p>“How did he achieve this?”</p><p>Such a question lingered in everyone’s minds.</p><p>Bai Zhou also stiffened, recalling how Xu Xiaoshou’s last killing of a demi-saint on Yunlun Mountain Range, against Rao Yaoyao, was quite forced.</p><p>It had been less than two months…</p><p>That was absurd!</p><p>Earlier, Bai Zhou actually didn’t even want to utter the title “Lord Shou” often.</p><p>Because it seemed to him that it made him look cheap.</p><p>“What’s my status? What’s his level?”</p><p>So even the cooperation with the First Pavilion in the Sky had been hesitant and reluctant.</p><p>And now…</p><p>“Impossible.”</p><p>Bai Zhou silently shook his head, blinked hard, and looked at Xu Xiaoshou again.</p><p>That young man who seemed insouciant as if he had just flicked his sleeves and did nothing, stood there with his hands behind his back, looking at others, with not even a trace of smugness on his face.</p><p>Ordinary and usual…</p><p>Bai Zhou read those four characters, thinking he was looking at The Divine, then blinked again and realized it was not.</p><p>It was just Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>It was Lord Shou!</p><p>“Absolutely impossible,” Bai Zhou’s vision blurred momentarily, feeling a suffocating sensation of being forcefully smashed and consumed by the subsequent waves crashing onto the beach.</p><p>Elder Sang was the first to recover from the petrified state, frowning as he stepped forward and dead-set asked Xu Xiaoshou:</p><p>“Who did you encounter?”</p><p>Unlike others, Fen Qin was thinking more.</p><p>This rebellious disciple might not have simply killed six demi-saints; there could be a special array or a trick set by Yue Gongli that he encountered.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou explained as if reciting treasures, “An old matchmaker, a tortoise, a Talisman Master, a mute, one…”</p><p>Elder Sang raised his hand to signify to stop.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou then stopped counting on his fingers.</p><p>Elder Sang pinched his eyebrows and turned back to the Water Ghost.</p><p>The Water Ghost struggled to start speaking, “Central Region, Hexagram Saint…”</p><p>“Yes, that’s how they introduced themselves,” Xu Xiaoshou nodded, with a touch of worry, “Is there something mysterious about this?”</p><p>He feared it was a trap, since the victory was too swift.</p><p>Elder Sang fell silent.</p><p>The Water Ghost followed in silence.</p><p>For a moment, everyone else fell silent too.</p><p>Except for Xu Xiaoshou, everyone at the scene was familiar with the Central Hexagram Saint.</p><p>If Lord Shou had mentioned any other name, it might have slightly diluted the shock in everyone’s minds.</p><p>The Central Hexagram Saint was not of a low level, even among the demi-saints, they were considered strong!</p><p>If these six were to combine their strength against a single demi-saint, probably no one would be confident to escape unscathed.</p><p>But against Lord Shou…</p><p>“You truly are a hedgehog!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu finally accepted this reality, looking at this young man who had bloodied his hands during their first encounter at the Spirit Palace, feeling nostalgic.</p><p>Back then…</p><p>And today…</p><p>Ah!</p><p>Cen Qiaofu couldn’t express his mixed emotions with any words now, only with an “ah.”</p><p>He looked at Xu Xiaoshou now with a sense of astonishment as if meeting Bazhun’an for the first time.</p><p>Similarly indescribable.</p><p>Similarly peerless!</p><p>“Lord Shou…”</p><p>The thirteen higher voids whispered to themselves.</p><p>Even now, when the former second-in-command saint servant Sleeveless and the current second-in-command Lord Shou stood together, these saint servant intelligence officers looked at them differently.</p><p>They no longer felt that the young man was presumptuous or abrupt.</p><p>They no longer felt that the older one was regrettable or helpless.</p><p>Everything suddenly seemed as if it should have been so all along.</p><p>Even when Saint Servant Bazhun’an back in the day… oh no, at that time, passed the position of the second-in-command to Lord Shou, placing that young man ahead of the Woodcutter and Water Ghost, everyone’s initial surprise and doubts now completely disappeared.</p><p>How could common people understand the Ten High Nobles?</p><p>Worthy of respect is Lord Bazhun’an!</p><p>Worthy of respect is Lord Shou!</p><p>…</p><p>“That’s enough, rein it in a bit.”</p><p>Elder Sang looked speechlessly at Xu Xiaoshou who still seemed to be looking at something far away, flicked the hand hanging behind him…</p><p>And didn’t stir.</p><p>This boy, seemed not to understand when to stop.</p><p>After everyone came out of their astonishment, if he continued this way, it would only backfire and make people uncomfortable.</p><p>“Respected, Passive Points, +16.”</p><p>“Regarded, Passive Points, +16.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Criticized, Passive Points, +13.”</p><p>“Belittled, Passive Points, +6.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The Information Bar’s popup really had turned from positive to negative.</p><p>Regrettably, there were too few people here, so the increase wasn’t much.</p><p>Yet, as of today, Xu Xiaoshou was no longer simply enjoying the substantial uplift in Passive Points total.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
