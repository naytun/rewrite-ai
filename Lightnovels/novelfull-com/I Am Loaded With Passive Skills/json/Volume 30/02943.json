Keep spinning, the branches are coming in!”</p><p>“Ugh…”</p><p>The Yin Coffin rapidly whirled around, tossing and turning amidst the tsunami.</p><p>The driver, Yue Gongli, attempted to guard against the Ancestor Tree branches attacking from all directions with the three remaining sides of the coffin.</p><p>It seemed that as long as it spun fast enough, three sides could be used as four, right?</p><p>But that was too exhausting. Unable to bear it any longer, Yue Gongli roared, “When will this end? While I’m piloting the Yin Coffin, you should come up with a plan!”</p><p>“I’m thinking, I’m thinking!”</p><p>“Hurry up! At this rate, my Yin Coffin is going to fall apart!”</p><p>“Ugh…”</p><p>Another sudden bout of vomiting.</p><p>Yue Gongli couldn’t help but send out his saint’s will towards the back, finding a face that was both strange and familiar—the face of a scholar.</p><p>He couldn’t hold back anymore, “Why is your Brother Anxiety of no use at all? Wasn’t he supposed to save us?”</p><p>“In theory, yes.”</p><p>“And in practice?”</p><p>“In practice…”</p><p>Inside of the Yin Coffin, Xu Xiaoshou looked at Kong Yuhen, who was being tightly spun to the very bottom, sticking close to the Six Marrow Corpse King.</p><p>For no apparent reason, his mind flashed with the absurd image of Kong Yuhen, one of the Ten High Nobles, being sent flying by a punch from the virtual image of The Divine.</p><p>After a long contemplation, he eventually said, “He might… get seasick from coffins?”</p><p>…</p><p>Boom boom boom boom boom!</p><p>The Ancestor Tree Branch lashed out wildly.</p><p>The Yin Coffin let out strained noises, thrown in all directions by the tsunami without any sense of purpose.</p><p>All the way through.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could no longer recall how many Spiritual Cultivators he had “encountered” along the way.</p><p>They all started at the higher void level, with the occasional demi-saint, but it was the same result; most would bubble up and vanish in an instant.</p><p>Or, the stronger ones could last three to five breaths before being quickly submerged by the tsunami.</p><p>And that was just what could be seen!</p><p>Out of sight, countless self-proclaimed extraordinary people eager to accept the inheritance of the god slayer had wandered here only to be unexpectedly led to this nascent divine palace and meet their end.</p><p>“There are too many.”</p><p>“Just how many from the higher void and how many demi-saints have come here?”</p><p>“With this wave, the Di Ying Holy Plant has gotten a massive haul; she’s not about to gather eighty-one semi-saint positions and become a God on the spot, is she?”</p><p>It was a good thing Yue Gongli couldn’t hear such sarcasm; otherwise, he would have been shocked at how the number eighty-one could be associated with becoming a God.</p><p>“There’s someone!” Suddenly, Xu Xiaoshou pointed towards the distance to the side and exclaimed in alarm.</p><p>“Where? Where?”</p><p>Yue Gongli’s eyes immediately brightened.</p><p>In the midst of this tsunami, even demi-saints were as helpless as fish on a chopping board.</p><p>The three of them had relied on the Great Psionic Weapon, the Yin Coffin, to have made it this far; who else could possibly fight against the Di Ying Saint Plant?</p><p>With a sweep of his saint’s will, Yue Gongli quickly noticed the person Xu Xiaoshou was talking about.</p><p>It was a voluptuous beauty with chaotic light purple hair, blowing wildly in the whipping of the Ancestor Tree branches.</p><p>She was carrying a large gourd in one hand and a dragon’s tooth larger than her own body in the other, though she didn’t need to use it.</p><p>Using just her shapely legs, she stepped and tore through the void, managing to protect her life against all odds.</p><p>And most importantly…</p><p>“From the higher void?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was blown away.</p><p>After a quick glance, he was sure this lady didn’t have Holy Power and hadn’t reached the Demi-Saint State. So…</p><p>Using her legs?</p><p>Ancient martial arts?</p><p>“I thought The Divine was already invincible, but who is she?” Xu Xiaoshou covered his forehead.</p><p>At the end of one’s tether, one realizes who the true heroes are!</p><p>“Meow?!”</p><p>Yue Gongli didn’t respond, but Greedy the Cat Spirit screamed in his head as if startled.</p><p>“Both of you…”</p><p>The voluptuous beauty entangled by the Ancestor Tree branches also noticed the capless coffin floating relentlessly with the waves and blurted out a powerful plea,</p><p>“Save me, for goodness’ sake!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s head buzzed.</p><p>Actually, the auntie had a quite pleasant voice, but something about the way she referred to herself… seemed a bit off, right?</p><p>“Hey, come closer!”</p><p>After cutting through the branches with her dragon’s tooth, the beauty tried to thrash her way over, but her thighs got entangled again, leaving her unable to free herself.</p><p>She wanted to say something else, but as the words were about to leave her mouth…</p><p>“Burp—”</p><p>Following a long burp,</p><p>The Yin Coffin was already blasted far away, completely out of reach.</p><p>“Damn! Drinking has done me in!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Who was that exactly?” Xu Xiaoshou turned to Yue Gongli.</p><p>Yue Gongli looked puzzled, focusing on steering the coffin without turning his head back, as if he had never seen such a person, “Such a formidable entity from the higher void.”</p><p>“You don’t know her either?”</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>“Deceived, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>You, Moon Fox!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost believed him.</p><p>Such a powerful figure couldn’t possibly be completely unknown; Xu Xiaoshou would believe it if she could rank on the Ancestral God Ranking.</p><p>Upon careful questioning, especially after recalling Greedy the Cat Spirit’s shriek, it turned out to be true!</p><p>“Palace Master Bai Zhou?”</p><p>“You know her?” Yue Gongli looked back in surprise.</p><p>“Don’t act like you didn’t!” Xu Xiaoshou was about to mock him when his eyes widened, “Damn it, focus on driving… Ptui, focus on steering the coffin…”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A robust Ancestor Tree branch directly swooped in from the open top.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou acted quickly, seizing a chunk with the Flame Python and cutting the dark branch off like slicing an octopus.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>As the branch broke off, a large amount of Evil God’s Energy gushed out from the broken end, trying to pollute everyone inside the coffin.</p><p>Yue Gongli remained indifferent.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou swallowed it greedily, channeling it into his Dragon Pearl.</p><p>“Ugh…”</p><p>Kong Yuhen was still firmly attached to the bottom of the coffin, dry heaving, oblivious to everything, and completely unaffected.</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
