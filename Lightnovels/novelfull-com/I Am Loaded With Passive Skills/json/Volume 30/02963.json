Or, even bolder, in the Thirty-Three Heavens?”</p><p>“If so, ‘Feather Ascension across the three realms, to see the true name’… hasn’t she already met the god slayer Ran Ming?”</p><p>“What then, happened there?”</p><p>What happened in the Eighteen Heavens and the Thirty-Three Heavens, Xu Xiaoshou did not know.</p><p>All he saw was the moment—the moment the Ancestor Tree itself emerged, The Divine was ripped open!</p><p>“He…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated.</p><p>The Ancestor Tree itself has descended; these people are still watching as if it were a play?</p><p>Could they still discuss so calmly here?</p><p>Elder Sang and Water Ghost did not respond.</p><p>But Cen Qiaofu looked over, about to pat Xu Xiaoshou’s shoulder but suddenly stopped, giving a forced smile:</p><p>“Kiddo, he is The Divine.”</p><p>…</p><p>“Interesting.”</p><p>The Divine still managed to smile even with the Ancestor Tree Branch piercing his chest.</p><p>“You’re using this against me?”</p><p>He grabbed forcefully at the branch in his chest, which was wildly plundering his life force, not pulling it out, but instead yanked it fiercely backward.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The void misaligned.</p><p>The eerie array diagram, constructed by demi-saint Cheng Guanglu’s Blood Rain, staggered like a living person being forcefully pulled along with the Ancestor Tree Branch for several meters.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>At the same moment, the same patterns lit up on the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar.</p><p>At this moment, everyone saw what had not been seen before:</p><p>The Ancestor Tree Branch, it turns out, besides the part from The Divine’s hand to the Blood Rain array, there was more!</p><p>The back part, passing through the Blood Rain array connected to the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar, climbing along the Pillar to the unseen higher heaven above.</p><p>It looked…</p><p>As if the Upper Realm had let down a branch, which, after several turns, finally assassinated The Divine.</p><p>But The Divine’s violent pull made the trace of this branch completely visible.</p><p>“She panicked!”</p><p>Indeed, after the Ancestor Tree was exposed, finding that although she pierced through The Divine, this human was not so easy to kill, it seemed to panic.</p><p>It writhed and struggled, trying to pull away from The Divine’s hand, through the Blood Rain array, the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar array back to the higher realm.</p><p>The Divine twisted the branch single-handedly, refusing to let go.</p><p>“She got greedy.” Water Ghost chuckled.</p><p>“Right, if she had the courage to amputate now, she could have retreated to her homeland and might have survived.” Elder Sang also laughed.</p><p>“She won’t do it; if she would, she would not have needlessly tried this move to save her thought incarnation left on the First Realm but already doomed to die.” Water Ghost slowly shook his head.</p><p>From start to finish, he and Elder Sang, almost blindly trusted The Divine, not believing this person could be killed so easily.</p><p>Even, The Divine being covertly attacked and their instinctual desire to help did not arise.</p><p>It seemed, as long as that person was The Divine…</p><p>A single man, could settle everything!</p><p>But!</p><p>“Even for the Ten High Nobles, isn’t this too much trust?” Thus, he thought.</p><p>Soon, Xu Xiaoshou experienced why every old man was so assured.</p><p>Chi Chi Chi Chi Chi!</p><p>The Ancestor Tree Branch struggled vainly, then abruptly swelled and burst into six thick branches, harshly drawing in with one brutal lash, fiercely whipping downward.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A tremendous noise burst forth along with rolling dust.</p><p>The Divine, far from falling, his eyes emitted a fierce light, and with a commanding shout:</p><p>“Way of Asura!”</p><p>In a flicker, the bare-chested, burly strong man transformed into a sinister monster with three heads and six arms, his whole body’s bloody aura nearly forming into substance.</p><p>Snap Snap Snap Snap Snap!</p><p>The five major branches were whipped down, caught one by one by the five arms of The Divine, who had the upper hand.</p><p>The leftover hand pulled out the main Ancestor Tree branch from his chest, all six arms tugging together.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Blood Rain pattern shattered.</p><p>The Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar pattern shattered.</p><p>The upper Ancestor Tree’s true body, as if being pulled back to the First Heaven, was further pulled out, revealing more of the black body.</p><p>The world quieted.</p><p>The Ancestor Tree was pulled into stupor, seemingly unaware of how a human body could be so brutally forceful!</p><p>Asura The Divine, holding the six branches, did not let go, and coldly chuckled:</p><p>“You’re doomed.”</p><p>Hiss!!</p><p>The Di Ying Holy Plant shrieked, realizing something was wrong:</p><p>Even the strong performance that killed her thought incarnation earlier was not all of The Divine, not even a drop in the bucket.</p><p>In panic, she tried to withdraw herself, shrinking back to the upper realm connected by the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar.</p><p>She couldn’t pull free!</p><p>A courageous amputation? It wasn’t too late yet!</p><p>“Snap Snap Snap Snap…”</p><p>The six Ancestor Tree branches all willingly broke, the remaining parts rapidly shrinking back like avoiding a fierce tiger.</p><p>The Divine, holding the broken main body of the Ancestor Tree branch, stuffed it into the mouths of his three heads, as if it were the most nourishing medicine in the world.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
