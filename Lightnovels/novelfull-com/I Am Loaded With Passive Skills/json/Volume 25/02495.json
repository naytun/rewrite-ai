He just had to pick anything and he would receive endless benefits.</p><p>As long as he gained the favor of the dragon spirit, it would bestow all of its wealth upon him. He would be able to begin a new chapter on the path of Spiritual Cultivation.</p><p>He would step on Bazhun’an and punch Elder Dao…</p><p>Li Fugui’s dream life: I am the only one who has a small world. Li Fugui’s mind was already filled with millions of words and hot-blooded images.</p><p>Of course, as an intelligence officer, he had undergone high-intensity temptation training, so it was difficult for him to lose himself.</p><p>Yuan Mansion space? No!</p><p>Paradise on Earth? Correct!</p><p>Li Fugui believed that anyone who saw such supreme treasures would have the same evil thoughts as he did at this moment.</p><p>People were evaluated by their actions rather than their thoughts.</p><p>In terms of his thoughts, he, Li Fugui, was better than most people.</p><p>His Dao heart was as steady as a rock, and he quickly recovered from the temptations.</p><p>“Greetings, Senior Dragon Apricot.”</p><p>Li Fugui bowed seriously and erased all the images that should not be on his mind.</p><p>Lord Shou already had so much and he was already so strong, yet he still could not struggle out of Bazhun’an’s palms. Hallmaster Dao was still as scheming as ever…</p><p>What ‘step on Bazhun’an and punch Elder Dao’ – they were merely a fool’s dream.</p><p>Even if he had ten times more treasures, he would not be able to defeat those monsters, okay? The Ten High Nobles were not humans at all!</p><p>Even if you have the life to take it, you can’t even enjoy it!</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit took a sniff of this human’s scent.</p><p>After it confirmed that this person was not controlled by an external force, was not possessed by an outsider, or was Bei Huai’s pawn sent to locate the space node of the Apricot Realm, it lost its initial interest and asked in boredom.</p><p>“What do you want?”</p><p>“Something urgent has cropped up and Junior needs to meet Lord Shou. I hope Senior will grant my request.” Li Fugui cupped his fists and bowed.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is still unconscious.”</p><p>“Still unconscious…” Li Fugui was stunned.</p><p>He knew that Lord Shou’s recovery ability was rare in the world. Any injury would be healed in a few breaths.</p><p>From the looks of it now, perhaps the consumption of energy to transform into that super-large giant was too much.</p><p>However, when he thought about it, it made sense. After all, the opponent was a Holy Emperor. Lord Shou was really… This was ridiculous!</p><p>“Inside.”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit tilted its head and disappeared into the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>Given its status, it was already a great honor that it exchanged more than a few more words with this human.</p><p>Li Fugui watched the senior leave and turned to look at the Crystal Palace.</p><p>“I don’t sense any aura from Lord Shou…”</p><p>He looked around and saw that no one stopped him, so he walked into the Crystal Palace.</p><p>It was spacious and empty inside. There were hardly any traces of people living there.</p><p>At this moment, there was only the fragrance of medicine, as well as the conducting alchemy cat and the ferret that watched the conducting alchemy.</p><p>“May I ask where Lord Shou is?”</p><p>“Inside.” The Little Frost Ferret turned around and used its mouth to point at the cauldron.</p><p>“Gululu…”</p><p>The medicinal fragrance bubbled under the lid and Li Fugui’s mind was momentarily stunned.</p><p>Lord Shou was being cooked?</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Li Fugui hurried forward, but he did not dare to disturb Greedy the Cat Spirit who was focused on its conducting alchemy.</p><p>He thought that since he was unfamiliar with this place, there should be some rules here. They must have their reasons for doing so.</p><p>He calmed himself and asked, “Lord Greedy the Cat Spirit is tending to Lord Shou’s injuries?”</p><p>Elder Han nodded and then shook his head. “I don’t know. Why are you looking for Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Li Fugui was cautious when it came to the Frost Ferret and also about Aunt Xiang’s matter, so he had to be as tactful as he could. He said, “There are a few complicated things…”</p><p>Complicated things?</p><p>How many more?</p><p>“Oh.” The Frost Ferret lost interest in trying to understand. “Then you’ll have to wait for a while.”</p><p>The situation was critical, and they couldn’t wait any longer!</p><p>Li Fugui raised his head and looked around again. “Where’s Lady Lei Xi’er? Mu Zixi?” he asked.</p><p>“She’s also inside.” Elder Han pouted.</p><p>“Gululu…”</p><p>The medicinal liquid was still bubbling away.</p><p>Li Fugui felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p>Was this really possible? He was refining Master Shou and Lei Xi’er at the same time… Mortal Elixirs?</p><p>“Lord Greedy the Cat Spirit?”</p><p>He had no choice but to ask.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit ignored him. Its mouth was set in intense concentration. Its two front paws moved rapidly and formed cat marks. Not long after…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>With a loud explosion, the lid of the three-legged cauldron shattered.</p><p>A gray aura gushed out, followed by arrays of medicinal fragrance.</p><p>One by one, the Elixirs, whether they succeeded or failed, flew out and were skillfully bottled by Greedy the Cat Spirit.</p><p>Grade 3 Elixirs…</p><p>Li Fugui was shocked. This was actually a third-grade conducting alchemy cat, so terrifying!</p><p>“Meow?”</p><p>You’re looking for my owner?</p><p>After Greedy the Cat Spirit formed the Elixirs, it turned its little head, reached out with its claws and fished out a naked human, Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Li Fugui’s face turned pale.</p><p>Lord Shou had already been injured to such an extent, yet it still needed him to refine Elixirs?</p><p>But soon, he saw that Greedy the Cat Spirit kept some of the third-grade Elixirs that were filled with vitality spiritual energy and gave the rest to Lord Shou.</p><p>Lord Shou’s feet was still on the Power Upanishad Formation. As he breathed in and out, not only was he breathing in and out the vitality spiritual energy of the Apricot Realm, but he also digested the medicinal power.</p><p>His face was already somewhat ruddy and his breathing was even. He did not look like he was seriously injured, but rather, he seemed to be sleeping soundly.</p><p>“Is he really healing?” Li Fugui was silent.</p><p>The ghost beast was conducting alchemy to save its owner.</p><p>As expected, there were all kinds of strange things around Lord Shou!</p><p>Then, he saw Greedy the Cat Spirit feeding the remaining Elixirs to another lifeless body in the alchemy cauldron… Lei Xi’er?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
