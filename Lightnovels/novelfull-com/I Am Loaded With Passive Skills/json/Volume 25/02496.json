Her breathing was weak, and she looked as if she was on the brink of death.</p><p>Li Fugui sighed.</p><p>As expected, not everyone was like Lord Shou. After he fought with the descendant of the Holy Emperor, he was not seriously injured or even close to death. Instead, he slept and waited his awakening.</p><p>Even though Lei Xi’er had the God Devil Eyes and the Ultimate Life Demon Physique, she was still severely injured by the Holy Emperor’s attack.</p><p>If not for the third-grade conducting alchemy cat who extended her life…</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that the conducting alchemy cat had refined so many Elixirs that belonged to Lord Shou and given a portion to her to replenish her energy…</p><p>At this moment, she might even die!</p><p>“What should we do?”</p><p>Li Fugui frowned. The people in charge were all unconscious, and even he felt powerless.</p><p>After all, no one could make a decision about Aunt Xiang’s matter, except Lord Shou!</p><p>At this moment, outside the Crystal Palace.</p><p>In the old poisonous fish pond, in front of the new spirit fish pond, a fishing rod that had been placed at the edge of the soil for a long time trembled and raised itself up.</p><p>“Crash…”</p><p>As the water flowed from the spirit pond, the fishing rod drew out a shriveled human figure, outlined by spiritual energy.</p><p>The two beasts in front of the alchemy cauldron suddenly panicked as if they had done something wrong. They suddenly became flustered and dug a hole together. When they realized that they could not do so, they drilled into the spatial crack.</p><p>Were they afraid to be seen by their owner? Li Fugui muttered silently as he turned and saw a strange scene.</p><p>Under the infusion of the vital life force, the shriveled portrait clone quickly filled out and reverted to the appearance of a normal person from its dehydrated state.</p><p>It was Lord Shou!</p><p>“Li Fugui, what is so urgent that you can’t even make a decision and that this Tower Master has to personally take action?”</p><p>Ran Ming ruins.</p><p>Jin Ren had stayed in the dark underground cave for quite some time.</p><p>The moment others entered the ruins, they would rush towards all sorts of opportunities and start to fight for them.</p><p>As soon as he entered the ruins, he hurriedly dug a hole and buried himself. He promptly burst into tears in the hole.</p><p>He cried until he was hoarse!</p><p>He cried so miserably!</p><p>He was also afraid of being discovered by others and get caught and killed…</p><p>In the battle against Bei Huai, Jin Ren was said to be number two. No one else dared to take the credit, not even The Divine.</p><p>After all, if he did not cry his heart out here, his original body wouldn’t be able to remain calm in front of the Holy Emperor Bei Huai. It would be a problem for him to even speak, let alone fight.</p><p>Now…</p><p>After the battle, the main body rested.</p><p>Theoretically speaking, Jin Ren could take the opportunity to use this noble body, along with all kinds of treasures and the power of the ancestral source and enjoy it.</p><p>However, from the perspective of protecting the main body, he would try his best not to use it.</p><p>After all, the main body wasn’t just injured physically. His vitality and vigor had been completely depleted, and he needed time to recuperate.</p><p>His weak will remained in his main body. Under the control of the Three Loathsome Eyes, it would quickly heal with the Life Dao Disc’s passive skill, Transformation, and the other high-level powers.</p><p>Once it was moved into the second true body, the second true body would not have any external power to maintain the various Great Dao Discs, nor would it have the power of the ancestral source for the transformation so it could heal.</p><p>It was equivalent to giving it away for free!</p><p>The recovery time would take a few days!</p><p>Thus, when he saw Li Fugui appear at the Apricot Realm, Jin Ren’s first reaction was not to do anything. Such a big happening was not as big as his destiny.</p><p>However, he realized that this fellow’s expression was too anxious. He thought that if nothing important had taken place, this shrewd person would not have come to the Apricot Realm.</p><p>Therefore, Jin Ren could only use a roundabout method to communicate.</p><p>His main body had left behind many portrait clones in the Apricot Realm as a backup plan. He had his own and the portraits of others.</p><p>Even his spiritual senses had been scattered there in case he died suddenly and couldn’t be resurrected with the Holy Medicine.</p><p>It was the same for Jin Ren.</p><p>Although most of the time, he had no choice but to self-destruct and had no backup plans, he still had to keep them.</p><p>He activated one of the portrait clones in his hand.</p><p>He used the cross-functional control technique and barely managed to make contact with Li Fugui in the Ran Ming ruins without alerting his main body. He found that he could indeed communicate with Li Fugui.</p><p>It was only used for fishing and maintaining the fishing rod. He had dreamed of using this fishing rod to become as famous as Hidden Bitter. The spiritual senses in this portrait clone naturally did not have much combat power.</p><p>But chatting was enough.</p><p>“Speak, what is it?”</p><p>Jin Ren controlled the portrait clone, and his movements became a little obscure.</p><p>But he quickly used the Human Realm Dao as a prompt. Even if he did not activate this move, he felt that the connection was much stronger. He could already walk into the Crystal Palace leisurely.</p><p>The Divine. Ancient Martial Arts…</p><p>Absolute!</p><p>Jin Ren shook his head when he looked into the alchemy cauldron. He didn’t punish Greedy the Cat Spirit. After all, Greedy the Cat Spirit had good intentions.</p><p>He first dressed his naked body to cover his shame, then used all his strength to carry Lei Xi’er out with difficulty.</p><p>He discovered that this girl did not have much energy left, and that her injuries were so severe that she could not even use Mu Zixi’s healing mode. He then pondered for a while and carried her to the site of the Primordial Purple Mist.</p><p>After the Apricot Realm evolved, the Primordial Purple Mist became much stronger.</p><p>Even the bodhi tree branch had three drops of purple liquid that hung from it-the kind that was viscous and had completely condensed into liquid.</p><p>Jin Ren controlled the portrait clone to take a drop and fed it to Lei Xi’er.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer suddenly popped out and opened its mouth to speak. In the end, it let out a long sigh and went back to sleep and chose to stay out of sight.</p><p>It was a bit of a waste to use these natural resources.</p><p>However, the Sovereign Stage had fought against the Holy Emperor. Even the Holy Medicine and God’s Blessing couldn’t save her.</p><p>Only the purple liquid condensed from the Primordial Purple Mist that could make the world evolve held some hope.</p><p>Li Fugui waited quietly and did not dare to show the slightest bit of urgency. When Lord Shou stopped and turned around, he hurriedly said.</p><p>“Lord Shou, something bad has happened.”</p><p>“Aunt Xiang has been captured by Hallmaster Dao!”</p><p>Aunt Xiang?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had entered the game?</p><p>Impossible. Why would this old man want to deal with a mere Xiang Yaoyao?</p><p>Jin Ren’s heart sank as he had a bad premonition. He grabbed the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale and used it to test his own safety.</p><p>“Bang Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang Bang!”</p><p>The heartbeats from the Holy Emperor Scale were so loud and fast that they seemed to pierce through one’s soul.</p><p>Almost at the same time…</p><p>In the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, the ancestral tree Dragon Apricot trembled.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit’s gaze was complicated and strange as it looked at Xu Xiaoshou’s portrait clone.</p><p>“I have two pieces of bad news. Which one do you want to hear first?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
