It accidentally fell into the hands of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man…The Blood World Pearl has a certain degree of autonomy. It might not be the case that the Seven Trees Emperor had taken a fancy to the Five Decays of Heaven and Man as a chess piece. It was possible that the Blood World Pearl saw a better new owner and its Guidance led the old owner to his death. The old owner was unaware or already knew but just followed the trend. (Important facts marked in red).</p><p>All the facts were listed out…</p><p>However, with such a glimpse, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man in Dao Qiongcang’s eyes seemed to have transformed into a heavenly creation under his hands.</p><p>From a distant stranger, he had become a close friend.</p><p>All those marked in red and important facts marked in red finally attributed to the most important and most essential question:</p><p>“I am very curious. How did you obtain your Body of Devour?”</p><p>In the Central Yuan world.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man had just heard the phrase ‘new friend’ when Dao Qiongcang’s question appeared in his ears.</p><p>At this moment, the soles of his feet felt chilled.</p><p>Blood World Pearl!</p><p>D*mn it!</p><p>There was no need to be in such a hurry to change its owner right?</p><p>When it saw someone like Dao Qiongcang, it immediately wanted to befriend him personally. Did you not consider whether the other person’s Great Path is smooth or not? Or if they wanted a dirty thing like you!</p><p>Without any hesitation, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man chose the most heartfelt decision-suicide.</p><p>Sacrificial Spirit Forbidden Escape!</p><p>He was so skilled that he didn’t even need to use any pinching spell. His eyes rolled back under the mask and he was about to die on the spot.</p><p>However, at this moment, Dao Qiongcang’s voice sounded…</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>Under his feet, like a Power Upanishad Formation, a Celestial Scroll filled with Divine Path Principles appeared!</p><p>Voices rang out in his ears. The format was the same, Great… Technique.</p><p>“Great Embroidery Technique!”</p><p>Far away at the Southern Zone gate of Jade Capital City, the Divine Path Principles emerged and weaved into an exquisite star bridge in the void.</p><p>It crossed several realms, from Jade Capital City, to the Central Yuan world in front of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>The Heavenly Group’s battle communicator that was scattered on the ground and had already rotted except for a small corner, trembled. It automatically emitted a weak divine path pattern and connected with the power of the star bridge, bit by bit.</p><p>This meant that Dao Qiongcang’s casting range had already touched the Central Yuan world.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man went numb.</p><p>This was not important! Too unimportant!</p><p>Previously, he had been too lazy to even step on those special communicators that had been destroyed and their powers had been swallowed by the Blood World Pearl.</p><p>This was because every white and red-clothed person had one. There were simply too many of them. He was lazy.</p><p>Now it seemed like…</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The Blood World Pearl spun slightly.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man seemed to have woken up, but it also seemed that he had been awake all the time.</p><p>“Sacrificial…”</p><p>The word ‘sacrificial’ had just appeared in the Sacrificial Spirit Forbidden Escape.</p><p>“Greater Teleportation Technique!”</p><p>The smiling Dao Qiongcang appeared in front of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, who wanted to defend but was not prepared.</p><p>“Spirit…”</p><p>“Great secret technique!”</p><p>The words that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man wanted to utter could no longer come out. All the Holy Power in his body had been imprisoned and sealed.</p><p>However, the Sacrificial Spirit Forbidden Escape wasn’t something that needed to be completed in one sentence before it could be used.</p><p>He had already completed the seal, and his Holy Power had been mobilized. His body had already undergone half a transformation. Half of it had escaped into the Great Path, and the other half was about to leave.</p><p>“Great Visualization technique!”</p><p>He had never heard of Dao Qiongcang’s mouth, the divine Sinan or the hand seals.</p><p>The remaining half of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man remained motionless.</p><p>This was because a black ocean had appeared beneath his feet-the Dead Sea!</p><p>He could only use half of his abilities, and the rest was restricted by the Spell Forbidden Barrier</p><p>“Great Stripping Technique!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang pointed at the orange mask.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s body that had been half-removed from the Sacrificial Spirit Forbidden Escape was separated out from the Path Principles and returned to its original spot.</p><p>At this point, Dao Qiongcang heaved a sigh of relief and shook his head.</p><p>“So hard to catch. You almost got away from under my nose.”</p><p>“Fortunately, I have rehearsed this solution and this scene for a total of 362 times.”</p><p>After a pause, Dao Qiongcang’s fingertips exerted force and shattered the orange mask.</p><p>“Tell me, how did you get the Body of Devour?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
