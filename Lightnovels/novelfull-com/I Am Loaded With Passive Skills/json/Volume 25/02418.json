Why did she have such fluctuating thoughts and mental struggles?</p><p>“It seems like you know what you’re doing.”</p><p>“But you are struggling. Why are you struggling?”</p><p>“Struggling for justice is obviously wrong… You, struggle for the sake of humans.”</p><p>Bei Huai’s telepathic communication through his soul body was extremely calm, but it progressed layer by layer.</p><p>As if he could read people’s minds, he skipped all the processes and pointed at Greedy the White Cat Spirit.</p><p>“You know what this is?”</p><p>“You were involved with the Xu Yue Grey Palace?”</p><p>“You, Dao Xuanji, Yu Kunpeng… One of the three had crossed an insurmountable forbidden line?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was stunned.</p><p>She was not proficient in the Dao of the soul body, or rather, she had never cultivated it before, so she could not control the fluctuations of her soul body at all.</p><p>Bei Huai looked at her as if he had installed a detector within her. He could easily read the little girl’s thoughts.</p><p>“No, you don’t know what it is.”</p><p>“Then you’re using words of justice to cover up the darkness for Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>Bei Huai’s voice rumbled like thunder and spread out in all directions.</p><p>“Are you helping Xiaoshou to stall for time?”</p><p>Near the Vermilion Bird Golden Tower, there was a group of trial-takers and trial officials who had not run too far off. They suddenly heard this voice from the depths of their souls.</p><p>Even at this moment of life and death, most people could not suppress their surprise. They stopped in their tracks and looked back in shock.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, Yu Zhiwen?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, Holy Emperor Bei Huai?”</p><p>A portion of them were shocked by the ambiguous relationship that had been revealed by the Holy Emperor.</p><p>Some people were shocked that the Holy Emperor Bei Huai had appeared because of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Why was he everywhere!</p><p>Mu Ling was stunned when he heard this.</p><p>He did not know anything about the soul body, but after he consumed the soul body Saint Pill, his saint’s will could touch the soul, so he naturally saw the existence of Bei Huai’s soul body.</p><p>The Holy Emperor’s judgment was rarely wrong.</p><p>He looked around at the fleeing Spiritual Cultivators in the distance, and at Yu Zhiwen, who had stopped in her tracks.</p><p>If it wasn’t for some ‘special’ reason, how could such a young girl dare to use ‘righteousness’ to try and stop the Holy Emperor’s actions?</p><p>Mu Ling looked at the scene in front of him silently, and there was a strange look in his eyes. The extinguished Flame of Annihilation almost popped out of his eyes.</p><p>I’m just watching the show…</p><p>He was very clear about his position.</p><p>He was a member of the Holy Palace, so he could just watch the civil war in the Holy Divine Palace. Xu Xiaoshou had not returned yet.</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>Mu Ling was stunned.</p><p>How did Xu Xiaoshou get into such a situation that he needed a little girl to stand up for him? Where did he go and why had he not returned yet?</p><p>“No…”</p><p>“I didn’t…”</p><p>On the other side, Yu Zhiwen panicked and waved her hands repeatedly.</p><p>However, the fluctuations of her soul, that boiled with panic and helplessness, had already told Bei Huai all the answers.</p><p>“Go back to the Holy Divine Palace and receive your punishment.”</p><p>Bei Huai’s soul body waved his hand and completely ignored Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>To him, if it wasn’t for Dao Xuanji and Yu Kunpeng who supported her, he wouldn’t even have said anything and would have just crushed her.</p><p>This was the first chance he had given.</p><p>Naturally, it would be the last time he would do that.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The fluctuations in the nameless void trembled.</p><p>After he shifted his gaze, Bei Huai stretched his giant hand without hesitation and grabbed Greedy the Cat Spirit, who had no one to protect itself.</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit screamed and subconsciously turned around to retreat, but it couldn’t find its owner.</p><p>The surroundings were unfamiliar. This was no longer the Apricot Realm, and there was no sense of security at all.</p><p>“This is… wrong…” Yu Zhiwen looked at this scene and didn’t hesitate at all as she chose to charge forward.</p><p>She was not good at talking, unlike Bei Huai.</p><p>She was not as glib as Xu Xiaoshou, who knew how to defend himself.</p><p>However, she was not stupid enough to be swayed by Bei Huai’s morals and lose her heart just because of a word!</p><p>Indeed, she had stepped forward partly for Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>But most of all, it was for herself!</p><p>Even if a Holy Emperor came today and his target was not Xu Xiaoshou or the ghost beast…</p><p>Since she had decided to speak up for the ‘right’ and reject the ‘wrong’.</p><p>Since she had chosen the ghost beasts that Xu Xiaoshou had insisted were not all evil, and the Holy Divine Palace was not all that righteous.</p><p>Now, how could she retreat?</p><p>“Swish, swish…”</p><p>She formed a seal in her hand and struck the astrolabe.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen knew that she couldn’t resist the power of a Holy Emperor, but she used the tiniest amount of power to form a defense for herself.</p><p>“Heaven Secrets Curtain!”</p><p>Starlight filled the void.</p><p>A magnificent soul body hand descended from the sky.</p><p>The Divine Path Principles turned into a fragile curtain that blocked the location of Greedy the Cat Spirit.</p><p>“Yu Zhiwen, come back! This is an order!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s voice was heard in the Heavenly Group’s battle channel and its tone was very serious.</p><p>With a sizzle, the soul body did not even touch the Heaven Secrets Curtain.</p><p>The Path Principles broke and the curtain was removed.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen gritted her teeth and dashed in front of the Greedy the Cat Spirit. She opened her arms wide and shouted over the extreme grounds.</p><p>“So, with power, you can ignore the rules, right?”</p><p>The penetrating power of her voice was too strong!</p><p>The trial-takers who watched from afar stood still with complicated expressions on their faces. They were shocked.</p><p>Even though not many people saw the soul hand in front of Yu Zhiwen, what they saw was a little girl who fought against ‘terror’ for either a fearless or noble reason.</p><p>Bei Huai’s eyes were cold, and he was only focused on Greedy the Cat Spirit. He was not in the least moved by the words of an ant.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
