There was a hint of fear in its eyes.</p><p>It already felt a sense of unease.</p><p>This time, the collapse of the sky seemed to be abnormal. It was really dangerous, and the danger seemed… to be targeted at it?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>The ancestral tree Dragon Apricot had been completely suppressed and had no choice but to call for help again.</p><p>Just as Xu Xiaoshou had figured, the Dragon Apricot was no match for a mere thought incarnation of a Holy Emperor.</p><p>The incarnation in this shattered world was just a facade.</p><p>The one who truly attacked the Apricot Realm was Bei Huai himself, who stayed hidden somewhere!</p><p>“Dog, come at me if you have the ability!”</p><p>The Berserk Giant could no longer restrain itself. It suddenly leaned back and grabbed the Holy Emperor Qilin’s body with great force. It then lifted up the Holy Emperor forcefully and almost turned him upside down.</p><p>“Woo…”</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin continued to cry and did not put up any resistance at all.</p><p>Perhaps it had tried to resist many times, but each time, it knew that it would be a futile attempt.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t stand it anymore.</p><p>“What the heck!!! You’re a divine Holy Emperor, all you do is cry!”</p><p>The Berserk Giant roared, and his eyes were about to pop out. A portion of the Heavenly Ancestor’s power in the Dragon Pearl fused into his body.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The shattered world exploded.</p><p>The power of the Dragon Ancestor and the Heavenly Ancestor’s Power merged together. The Golden Giant lifted the Qilin up like a ball and hurled it at Bei Huai’s Holy Emperor thought incarnation.</p><p>“It was all in vain.”</p><p>Bei Huai seemed to be laughing. He did not care about the Qilin that cannoned toward him that contained two of the power of the ancestral source.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The crying Qilin felt as if the world was spinning.</p><p>Then, it felt as if it had smashed into something. In reality, it had smashed Bei Huai’s Holy Emperor thought incarnation into dust.</p><p>“To me, my physical body is like a restraint.”</p><p>“After the soul body attained enlightenment, nothing in the world can restrain it.”</p><p>A mocking voice resounded in the Nine Heavens at the same time.</p><p>When the Holy Emperor Qilin shattered the body of Bei Huai’s thought incarnation, it passed through his gigantic soul body. Xu Xiaoshou felt a great sense of powerlessness.</p><p>This was just like how physical attacks could never touch the soul of an existence that was merely an illusion. His attack seemed to have hit against cotton.</p><p>Bei Huai’s soul body was completely unharmed!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A huge crack appeared in the sky above the Apricot Realm.</p><p>The Ancestral Tree Dragon Apricot could only withstand the power of a soul hand of one soul body. It could not stop the covert attack of another soul hand that came from the back.</p><p>The dark green hand finally broke through the space and entered the Apricot Realm.</p><p>It pointed directly at Greedy the Cat Spirit!</p><p>“Meow!!!”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit’s fur stood on end. It yowled and leaped up as if its feet were scalded.</p><p>In its eyes, this dark green soul hand seemed extremely delicious, but it was like a big fish that could not be eaten in three lifetimes.</p><p>To swallow it forcefully would only result in its death.</p><p>But if it didn’t swallow it, the cat would be crushed by the fish!</p><p>“You’re f*cking disgusting…”</p><p>In the shattered world, Xu Xiaoshou went crazy when he saw this.</p><p>Without a word, he raised his eyebrows at the burly soul giant.</p><p>Heart Sword Technique, Demons Under Eyes!</p><p>“A mantis trying to stop a chariot.”</p><p>Bei Huai was indifferent.</p><p>Only a small part of the soul giant split open and formed a tiny Bei Huai soul body.</p><p>The power that split off did not even have one-ten-thousandth of its original form, but it was full of intelligence and spirituality.</p><p>It blocked Bei Huai’s sight and connected with Xu Xiaoshou’s Heart Sword Technique.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The tiny Bei Hua soul body exploded with boundless devilish energy. He instantly lost his mind and underwent a cultivation deviation.</p><p>“Soul Devouring Technique.”</p><p>Bei Hua’s soul body inhaled and the tiny Bei Hua turned into two streams of energy.</p><p>One was the pure power of the soul being devoured and returned to its original self.</p><p>The other was the abandoned evil spirit power trash that had been casually discarded. The Soul Devouring Technique could only devour the soul, but it could not devour the cultivation deviation.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind went blank as he watched how the soul body spiritual technique was used.</p><p>He felt like he was a baby who had raised his sword and was about to slash at the adults. Bei Huai casually waved his hand and broke his big move.</p><p>Holy Emperor…</p><p>The Holy Emperor Bei who cultivated the way of spirit and soul…</p><p>A fully matured member of the Ten High Nobles, a Hell-level monster…</p><p>How could he fight against it?</p><p>This was Bazhun’an’s opponent, right? Why did he look for me!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was on the verge of collapse. He was still a whole generation away from Bei Huai, in terms of resources, distance and time.</p><p>“Your Ancient Sword Technique is quite good, but compared to Bazhun’an, it is not worth mentioning.”</p><p>“That’s right, brat, I want to remind you…”</p><p>Bei Huai’s giant soul body laughed and chatted away. He did not bother to hide his weakness.</p><p>“The Phantom Swords Technique can hurt me, but I wonder how well you’ve cultivated your Phantom Swords Technique?”</p><p>As he stepped on the Spirit Dao Disc, Xu Xiaoshou could tell that his soul had started to boil again without Bei Huai having to say more.</p><p>He was indeed enraged.</p><p>He hurriedly stifled his impulsive thoughts</p><p>“Bei Huai is provoking me!”</p><p>“The stronger the fluctuations of my soul body, the more obvious the connection between me and the Apricot Realm will be. In this way, Bei Huai will not likely lose the random coordinates of the Apricot Realm among the space-time debris!</p><p>“What I need to do is not to get angry, but to cut off the connection between Bei Huai and the Apricot Realm for at least a moment and make him lose his way.”</p><p>“As long as he can’t connect to it for a moment, the spatial coordinates of the Apricot Realm would be disordered and random. He can only find the location of the Apricot Realm by angering me again.”</p><p>“At that time, my ‘Independence’ will come in handy!</p><p>It had to be said that the special passive skill, the Unity of Man and the Heavens was indeed powerful. Xu Xiaoshou, who stepped on the Spirit Dao Disc, quickly figured out another way to counter Bei Huai.</p><p>However, the problem was:</p><p>How would he cut off the Holy Emperor’s Perception of the Apricot Realm, even for a moment?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
