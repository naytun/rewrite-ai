This is world replication… This newcomer is using countless lifeless worlds to try and neutralize the power of the Holy Emperor!”</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>“This, who is this?”</p><p>“Spatial Upanishad… I think, there’s only one person in the world, right?”</p><p>Far away in the Qilin world, even the orange-robed Five Decays of Heaven and Man was stunned for a moment. He thought that it was Chief Huang Quan, who entered the scene.</p><p>The next moment, he realized that it wasn’t.</p><p>It was someone else!</p><p>“Sigh!”</p><p>The white-haired Daoist child, Ye Xiaotian, appeared on the battlefield with a complicated expression on his face.</p><p>How should he put it?</p><p>He had thought that Bazhun’an might have tricked him.</p><p>He had also thought that Xu Xiaoshou’s opponent would be several times stronger than that guy.</p><p>He had never thought that this duo could be so ridiculous!</p><p>One of them asked him to fight the Holy Emperor!</p><p>One of them at the scene was even a Holy Emperor!</p><p>D*mnit, this was simply the greatest joke in the world!</p><p>“What can I do?”</p><p>“I’m just a small higher void. I don’t have the power of the ancestral source. I’ve only perfected my final-stage Spatial Upanishad. I want to bloom. I want to become a flower…”</p><p>“My life is over!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was on the verge of a breakdown.</p><p>Why did it become so difficult every time he wanted to come out and fight?</p><p>Why?</p><p>“Hold on.”</p><p>Patriarch Wuji who carried Liu Changqing’s bag had been summoned by Bazhun’an too. After he landed, he looked up and took a glance before he pulled out a Heaven Secrets Curtain and kept himself hidden.</p><p>Yes, that’s right.</p><p>He was a demi-saint, he was Xuan Wuji!</p><p>However, he was also an extremely weak Divine Sorcerer…</p><p>It was good that he was behind the scenes, as he could not be as useful as the higher void Upanishad Ye Xiaotian.</p><p>“Die…”</p><p>Bei Huai’s will seemed to have been assimilated with the force of the Holy Path and what was left was his obsession.</p><p>He was so maniacal that he targeted anyone who dared to enter the arena, be it Lei Xi’er, Ye Xiaotian, or even Xuan Wuji, who had stayed hidden at that time.</p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p>The Three-day Soul Shifting array moved with the Holy Emperor’s will, and the outer Three Heavens completely collapsed.</p><p>At this moment, there was only a large, bare and unstable spatial passageway that led to an area that held a kind of melancholia.</p><p>The shattered outer layer gathered the power of the Holy Emperor to the extreme. It turned into several dozen beams of destructive lights that shot toward everyone in the world below.</p><p>“He’s crazy!”</p><p>“The Holy Emperor has gone crazy!”</p><p>Everyone in the Qilin world and the Central Yuan world felt their scalps turning numb.</p><p>That’s right, the Holy Emperor had gone mad and started attacking indiscriminately.</p><p>Once a Holy Emperor lost control, the consequences would be catastrophic.</p><p>“Hu…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian looked up at the meteor shower in the sky, his face darkened by the gray light. He let out a long sigh.</p><p>In the next moment, his bun came apart and his white hair fluttered about wildly in the sky. His aura forcefully reached the clouds.</p><p>“I am the Lord of Ten Thousand Realms!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s eyes were about to pop out of their sockets. He extended his hand and thrust it into the sky.</p><p>At this moment, the world changed colors.</p><p>The destructive lights that descended from the sky seemed to be separated from him by thousands of worlds.</p><p>“Hand of Ripping Heaven!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian forcefully broke apart the sky of the Central Yuan world into two, then ripped off the entire black realm of sky. He then swallowed the sky fragments that were in his hand.</p><p>‘A tiny mustard seed can contain Mount Sumeru, space eats space’.</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The entire Central Yuan world fell into endless chaos. They only felt that at this moment, the sky was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>He originally thought that the Qilin world was the main battlefield.</p><p>He never thought that the apocalypse would actually descend on the Central Yuan world in the end!</p><p>The sky had turned into a bottomless black hole.</p><p>Endless spatial blades and spatial storms raged down with a whoosh. They were about to fall like destructive lights and could destroy an entire world.</p><p>At this time of the apocalypse, the people of the Central Yuan world had no way to save themselves, then a strange sound exploded in their ears again.</p><p>“Today, the Lord of this world shall be the one with the name Ye!”</p><p>When they looked up, they saw a short white-haired Daoist child who had a semi-saint person that floated above his head. He put his palms together and pushed himself up into the sky.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The saint calamity descended.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The endless spatial blades, spatial storm, and destructive rays were all stopped by Ye Xiaotian’s support!</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>The people below were all shocked.</p><p>The sky was falling, and the short man held it up?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s face was flushed red, and he trembled with rage.</p><p>What am I?</p><p>How dare I!</p><p>What right and confidence do I have to undergo sanctification under a single strike from a Holy Emperor?</p><p>Oh, not only did he undergo sanctification, but he also fought against a storm in the world just to buy time for that kid?</p><p>What was his last name?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, if you don’t wake up soon, I really can’t hold on anymore…”</p><p>The divine calamity descended with a loud bang, and Ye Xiaotian spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>However, the Spatial Upanishad turned into the purest light under his feet. Above a world, there were thousands of worlds. There was an illusion of thousands upon thousands of worlds …</p><p>As the saint calamity descended.</p><p>As the storm descended.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s body emitted a dazzling light made of path energy and the Power Upanishad Formation beneath his feet shone with an even brighter glow.</p><p>He did not only transcend the tribulation, but he was also beginning to gain insight from the tribulation!</p><p>“The storm can also be used by me…”</p><p>“The debris flow should be where I belong…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s eyes widened as he ended his momentary insight and infused his Spatial Upanishad into the spatial fragment.</p><p>In an instant, the spatial blades and spatial storm that were headed towards him actually returned with the myriad world obstruction and blasted towards the destructive light!</p><p>“Success!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was delighted.</p><p>However, he also knew his limits.</p><p>Even if he could hold on for a while, he wouldn’t be able to last forever. He wasn’t skilled in the path of the soul body, so he was completely helpless against the will of a Holy Emperor.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, hurry up!”</p><p>Not enough!</p><p>It was far from enough!</p><p>The Ultimate Giant, who was immersed in the world of swordsmanship, could actually use his Perception to see the situation in the outside world.</p><p>It was because of Master Dean’s presence that he had more time to catch his breath and imitate more of Master Siren’s sword moves.</p><p>“That swordsmanship is renowned. It’s called Ghost…”</p><p>The Myriad World storm resisted the Holy Emperor’s destructive light.</p><p>Suddenly, the sound of Taoist music appeared again in the world. At this moment, the gates of hell moved, and hundreds of ghosts appeared.</p><p>Countless people looked over and felt thoroughly overwhelmed.</p><p>This big battle came in waves. It was unknown who was the main character here.</p><p>However, in the next moment, a cold voice sounded and made them aware of who was the one who could break today’s situation!</p><p>“The way of ghosts, Yin and Yang obstruct each other, and the prison gate is isolated. Today’s sword opens the door, and the Hundred Ghost Night Walk.”</p><p>With a buzz, the gates of hell was completely pierced through. An illusion of a hundred ghosts appeared within and revealed their physical bodies.</p><p>The world was already in complete darkness, and there were no more phenomena that required any transformation in the Hundred Ghost Night Walk.</p><p>Everyone in the Central Yuan world felt chills run down their spines. They had a feeling of being in the previous Senluo Realm.</p><p>“Woo…”</p><p>The cries of these ghosts and spirits were secondary.</p><p>When the gates of hell were completely formed, the Ultimate Giant’s jaw dropped. A few Soul Holy Medicine appeared in his mouth, and he quickly digested them.</p><p>“Virtual reality…”</p><p>“Spirit meat.”</p><p>Weng!</p><p>The Way of the Sword Disc under his feet turned into a Spirit Dao Disc.</p><p>The Ultimate Giant opened his eyes and clearly saw all the spirits in the world. It was time for him to change his form and receive another wave of gifts from this world.</p><p>“Hungry! Ghost! Dao!”</p><p>The Ultimate Giant did not hesitate.</p><p>He couldn’t even make a sound, let alone jump into the gates of hell.</p><p>The only thing he could do was to take his last breath, raise his right arm, and slowly reach into the gates of hell.</p><p>Slowly but firmly…</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Bei Huai’s will was almost destroyed and was left with only struggle and unwillingness in the world. It was difficult for its voice to materialize.</p><p>He was unwilling!</p><p>He had gone to such an extent!</p><p>The God Devil Eyes and the Spatial Upanishad stopped him.</p><p>Now, the Hungry Ghost Path was about to materialize again. What Xu Xiaoshou wanted was to kill him completely!</p><p>“Long…”</p><p>In just an instant.</p><p>In the silence, the Hungry Ghost’s hand reached out from the gates of hell.</p><p>It was dark green, covered in scars, oozed pus, and was totally disgusting. It had countless horns and tentacles…</p><p>However, it was precisely this arm of a hungry ghost that was no longer as weak as an Ultimate Giant after it reached out from the gates of hell. It moved extremely quickly.</p><p>It clenched its fist, a fist that could cover the sky.</p><p>It passed through the spatial storm, Ye Xiaotian who was separated by the myriad worlds, and the saint calamity.</p><p>It struck Bei Huai’s remnant soul that was secretly hidden in the soul of the Great Path Dao and the Holy Path in the Ultimate Giant’s eyes, as well as Bei Huai’s will that had been revealed by the Fallen Flower World and had been integrated into the Holy Path.</p><p>All things came together in one punch.</p><p>At this moment, the world held its breath.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was extremely calm, as if he was a dead man and did not display any emotions.</p><p>“If Yin Cao is not angry, the fist can penetrate the dark.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
