Thank you.”</p><p>Ah Yao’s fingertips were trembling. From time to time, the sound of her hands hitting against the pipa could be heard in the carriage.</p><p>“What did you say?”</p><p>“Please hurry up. Thank you,” Ah Yao raised her voice a little, but it was only by a little.</p><p>“We will reach there soon. Stop rushing me. It wouldn’t be good to bump into someone!”</p><p>The coachman knew that the person he was driving was just an ordinary person with a bit of money. She wasn’t a Spiritual Cultivator, moreover, she was ugly and had a bad temper.</p><p>“Sorry…”</p><p>Ah Yao shrunk her head, her voice as soft as a mosquito. It was unknown if the coachman had heard her.</p><p>The journey was incredibly long as if it had taken a century.</p><p>When the carriage came to a sudden stop, there was a loud bang in the carriage and a loud noise.</p><p>Not long after, Ah Yao held her forehead and frowned. She bent over and walked out with her pipa in her arms.</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>She handed a bag of Spirit Crystals and did not dare to look at the coachman’s face. Aunt Xiang had said that her eyes could bring disaster.</p><p>“Take care.”</p><p>The coachman weighed the money bag and chuckled. He watched the customer leave and sighed as he looked at her graceful back.</p><p>“Your butt is big and round. It looks quite nice and perky…”</p><p>Not far away, Ah Yao’s body trembled and her footsteps became even faster.</p><p>“What a pity, she’s an ugly ghost.”</p><p>“Otherwise, my Little Zhao would be able to have a good time today…”</p><p>After Ah Yao alighted, she first found a shadow to hide herself in. Soon, she saw the signboard “Dong Ji” displayed outside the tea shop.</p><p>The streets were a little chaotic. People were gossiping and talking about something.</p><p>However, it was good that no one was paying attention to her.</p><p>Ah Yao didn’t walk into the tea shop. Instead, she first began observing some hidden places.</p><p>Having grown up in a place like Yougui Pavilion, she had long learned to observe people’s expressions and discern the truth from small details.</p><p>It was impossible for her to leave the city openly.</p><p>Aunt Xiang could be above, behind, across the tea shop, or even at the stalls of various vendors in the surrounding area. She couldn’t drink tea and wait for others openly.</p><p>Not everyone was like that Xu Gusheng, who could swagger through the streets.</p><p>Soon, Ah Yao saw the pale-faced tanghulu stall owner not far away. His gaze fell on a stick of tanghulu that had fallen to the ground.</p><p>It could be seen that this was the source of the stall owner’s panic.</p><p>Amidst the howling of the wind, there was a commotion in all directions, except for the small alley beside the tea shop, which was rather quiet.</p><p>This was not a bad hiding place…</p><p>Ah Yao hunched over and walked silently until she collided with something soft with a thud.</p><p>She looked up and saw an unfamiliar, cold woman’s face.</p><p>“I’m sorry, !…”</p><p>Ah Yao was stunned.</p><p>She recognized the woman’s earrings. Dongdong!</p><p>Ah Yao’s eyes flashed with joy, but she suddenly became frightened and dropped to the ground.</p><p>“Sister Dongdong…”</p><p>At the same time, Dongdong’s eyes turned cold as she thought of Aunt Xiang’s probing.</p><p>Was this action really as simple as a test?</p><p>Among the three of them, there must be someone who had second thoughts!</p><p>The joy of recognizing a familiar person flashed across Ah Yao’s eyes, but she immediately became alarmed and vigilant. Then, she heard the familiar yet unfamiliar “Sister Dongdong”.</p><p>Dongdong closed her eyes and gritted her teeth.</p><p>“Mei’er, Aunt Xiang has treated you well…” She thought.</p><p>However, when she opened her eyes, she saw the candied haws that no one dared to pick up on the ground not far away. The voice, “Who dares to touch my Aunt Xiang”, rang in her ears again.</p><p>Was it intentional?</p><p>Or was it true feelings?</p><p>Or was everyone really not a traitor, and Aunt Xiang was just testing the waters?</p><p>Dongdong opened her mouth, her eyes filled with confusion.</p><p>“I can’t guess, Aunt Xiang. I really can’t guess. I am too stupid…” Dongdong thought.</p><p>“You can leave.”</p><p>Dongdong looked at the pipa girl lying on the ground and said indifferently.</p><p>She didn’t trust anyone but Aunt Xiang.</p><p>“Aren’t you…Then, what about Sister Mei’er?”</p><p>Ah Yao was smart and quick-witted. How could she not see Sister Dongdong’s reaction? It proved that she was not a traitor.</p><p>Dongdong was silent for a while, then shook her head and said,</p><p>“It’s none of your business.”</p><p>“There are over a hundred white-clothed people here. Between you and me, one of us must have leaked the news.”</p><p>“I won’t kill you. Just as Aunt Xiang said, I’m thinking about our relationship for more than ten years.”</p><p>Ah Yao looked at her with tears in his eyes. She hugged her pipa and felt as if she had been abandoned by the entire world.</p><p>“Why aren’t you leaving!”</p><p>Dongdong shouted coldly, her killing intent obvious.</p><p>The violent higher void’s energy movement was suppressed, only half of it leaked out. With a “pff” sound, the pipa that had shrunk to the corner of the alley was stained with a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Ah Yao’s eyes rolled back, and even speaking became difficult.</p><p>Dongdong was stunned.</p><p>Looking at Ah Yao, whose entire chin was stained with blood, she finally remembered that this girl was only a mortal. How could she resist the aura of a higher void?</p><p>“Sorry, I am sorry…”</p><p>Dongdong hurriedly squatted down and hugged this delicate and delicate woman, extending her spirit source.</p><p>Ah Yao’s veins were all broken, and she was not far from death.</p><p>“I’m so sorry…”</p><p>Dongdong almost broke down and cried.</p><p>Once Aunt Xiang left, she was already panicking to the extreme. Even a normal person could not maintain their thoughts.</p><p>When she realized that she was a Spiritual Cultivator, she hurriedly took out an elixir and fed it to Ah Yao. After barely keeping her life, she kept apologizing.</p><p>“Sister Dongdong…”</p><p>Ah Yao woke up after a short coma. The first thing she did was ask, “Where’s Aunt Xiang?”</p><p>“She’s inside.”</p><p>Inside?</p><p>Looking at the direction of her finger, the street was noisy.</p><p>Ah Yao suddenly realized something, “A Spiritual Cultivator’s…bounded domain?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
