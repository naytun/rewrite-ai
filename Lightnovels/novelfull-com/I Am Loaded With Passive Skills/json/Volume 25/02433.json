He looked at the strange phenomenon on it and shook his head.</p><p>“The Holy Emperor has merged with the Dao and his ghostly power is natural. His luck is off and he is forced to enter the south…”</p><p>“This is being displayed publicly and each is extraordinary. Even if the memories can be erased later, how much effort would it take?”</p><p>“Even if the memories of mortals are washed away, how can the capable people who witnessed this situation let it go so easily? Their eyes will definitely be focused on you. It’s not wise to be on the stage or behind the scenes!”</p><p>“I never thought that Greedy the Cat Spirit would tempt your greed to such an extent. Now, you’ve been exposed. Why is it like this, why?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s hurried footsteps paced through the great hall, as if he was a grasshopper on a hot pan.</p><p>However, after only a short while, he walked to the front of the silver table and sat down. The smile that he could not suppress finally blossomed like a flower.</p><p>“Why did you have to do this…”</p><p>A soft murmur echoed in the vast Saint Hall.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang blinked. The joy in his eyes disappeared and turned into worry.</p><p>“How can this be good?”</p><p>“Aiyaya!”</p><p>He looked around, but there was no one around.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng was not around anymore and Dao Qiongcang felt bored.</p><p>“Caution, caution…”</p><p>His expression became normal and he placed the divine Sinan on the table. He looked into the distance toward the south of the continent.</p><p>After he pondered for a long time, Dao Qiongcang muttered to himself with infinite longing.</p><p>“It’s time to be born. It’s time to show off…”</p><p>“Then, what should I call it?”</p><p>His fingers were wet, and he couldn’t help but start to trace patterns on the table. He left a few shallow water marks on the table.</p><p>“Secret God…”</p><p>However, at this moment, Dao Qiongcang’s fingers paused and he stopped moving. He reached out and wiped away all the water marks on the table.</p><p>His expression became very subtle and filled with anticipation.</p><p>“Secrets cannot be revealed.”</p><p>Gong Yang Mountain.</p><p>“Woo!”</p><p>The Holy Emperor’s cries resounded in all directions.</p><p>Gong Yang Mountain rumbled and quaked.</p><p>“How can a weak ant defeat a Holy Emperor?!”</p><p>When the Holy Emperor Qilin stuck its head out, its deep blue eyes were filled with black tears. Its entire body emitted the aura that was unique to Bei Huai’s soul body.</p><p>When the high and mighty voice filled with ridicule came out of the Holy Emperor Qilin’s mouth.</p><p>The Divine also completely understood what Xu Xiaoshou meant.</p><p>He could tell that this was the so-called ‘perfect combination’!</p><p>“This is the second Holy Emperor you provoked?”</p><p>“Just now, Bei Huai was willing to be torn apart by me so he could escape with a wisp of his soul to possess this thing?”</p><p>“Ghost beast host body?” The Divine pointed at the Qilin that blotted out the sky and said thoughtfully.</p><p>“That’s right!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was also shocked when he saw the Holy Emperor Qilin.</p><p>Through his Perception, he could see that the Qilin’s willpower was almost zero, and the fluctuation of his soul was also almost zero.</p><p>All of his will had been replaced by Bei Huai.</p><p>It was not an exaggeration to say that it was a ‘Possession’!</p><p>“However, I did not expect that it would develop in such a manner…” Xu Xiaoshou exclaimed.</p><p>He had thought that the Qilin was a ghost beast, and to display its strength, it would need to provide a ghost beast host body at the Demi-Saint stage.</p><p>However, he never thought that Bei Huai would do the opposite and choose to directly enter the Holy Emperor Qilin’s true body.</p><p>The current situation…</p><p>Bei Huai was the ghost beast.</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin was his ghost beast host body!</p><p>A Holy Emperor soul body, the body of an ancient Saint beast. This was Bei Huai’s research?</p><p>Or should I say, one of the studies?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gulped. He couldn’t help but look at The Divine and provoked him as he asked, “Are you afraid?”</p><p>“Hahahaha…”</p><p>The Divine raised his head and laughed fearlessly.</p><p>“The martial cultivators of my generation are not afraid of words. If you want to learn it, I will risk my life to accompany you!”</p><p>“Little brat, observe carefully…”</p><p>After The Divine said this, he dispelled the Human Realm Dao and turned into a virtual image form.</p><p>In an instant, his face was covered in tears. The virtual image almost could not withstand the emotional influence of Bei Huai’s Holy Emperor power and was about to shatter.</p><p>At the same time, The Divine took a deep breath.</p><p>“Shuu!”</p><p>At this moment, the essence of all things in the world and the true power of the sun and moon seemed to be absorbed into The Divine’s body. His bones, muscles, blood, and flesh were fused together and glowed with endless mysteries.</p><p>“Human Realm Dao!”</p><p>The Divine’s eyes lit up, and his virtual image slowly solidified.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes widened. The Body Dao Disc appeared under his feet and he entered the state of the Unity of Man and the Heavens.</p><p>He had already seen the Six Paths of the Human Realm Dao.</p><p>He also knew that this technique could absorb the essence of all living beings in the world and turn them for his own use. Even a virtual image could be solidified into half a real person…</p><p>If The Divine’s true body used it, he really did not know how many times it could increase his own strength.</p><p>However, the first few times he saw it was rushed, and he used his Body Dao Disc to reflect on it. Even if he had some comprehension, he couldn’t get it.</p><p>This time, The Divine deliberately slowed down to give Xu Xiaoshou time to prepare. He did not hide the mysterious Transformation that occurred when he activated the Six Paths.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was like a hungry sponge. Under the Unity of Man and the Heavens state, he frantically memorized, absorbed, and digested the Transformation of the ancient martial arts of the Six Paths of the Human Realm Dao.</p><p>At this moment, all the spirits in the world had been plundered by The Divine and used by him.</p><p>He thought about the true meaning, how to deduce the essence through the process, and how to transform other people’s knowledge for his own use.</p><p>A thunderous voice exploded in Xu Xiaoshou’s mind.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
