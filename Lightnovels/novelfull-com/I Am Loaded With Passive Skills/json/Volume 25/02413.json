It also successfully blasted Rao Yaoyao into a remnant soul and she could only sacrifice her sword in order to survive.</p><p>In the end, Xu Xiaoshou was able to kill a demi-saint.</p><p>But now, after the battle on Abyss Island, the increase in the charge point of this special passive skill was pitifully slow.</p><p>When he looked at this low charge point, and then looked at Bei Huai’s unbelievably burly giant soul body…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts stopped for a moment.</p><p>At the same time, he also stopped switching his consciousness between Jin Ren and his main body.</p><p>Fight to the death!</p><p>“+(Affected. Passive Points),+1.”</p><p>When the Information Bar popped up again, his Spiritual Awakening was triggered, and the passive counterattack was formed at the same time.</p><p>The Berserk Giant pointed a finger from afar.</p><p>The compressed powers in his body erupted.</p><p>The Heavenly Ancestor’s Power, the power of the Dragon Ancestor, the sword cognition, the Holy Power, the Ember Heart, the Three Days Frozen Calamity…</p><p>Under the transformation of the Spirit Dao Disc, all the powers barely touched the intent of a soul body attack.</p><p>However, all of these were supplementary, and their functions were only to completely detonate the Disillusionment Finger.</p><p>“Whoosh.”</p><p>A faint light flashed.</p><p>The passive counter-attack of the Disillusionment Finger was so fast that even Bei Huai did not seem to realize that he needed to defend.</p><p>In Bei Huai’s world, no matter how strong Xu Xiaoshou was, his strength laid in his swordsmanship and physical body, not his soul body.</p><p>If Bei Huai claimed to be second in this world, then no one would dare to claim to be first.</p><p>Therefore, even if Xu Xiaoshou could hurt the small Beihuai, he could not kill the powerful soul body of the Holy Emperor’s thought incarnation with just one move.</p><p>When the faint green color passed through his body and mixed with all kinds of beginner Saint Stage powers, it pierced through the chest of the giant Bei Huai’s soul body…</p><p>The shattered world was the first that could not withstand this attack.</p><p>This was only the manifestation of the Holy Emperor Qilin’s broken consciousness. How could it withstand an attack that could destroy the First Hall of Sins?</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>In the Four Symbols Secret Realm, a loud rumble suddenly sounded from the depths of the earth. In an instant, the mountains and the earth shook violently.</p><p>Vermilion Bird lineage, near the Vermilion Bird Golden Tower.</p><p>The ground exploded, and dust and rocks flew into the air and reached a height of several thousand feet.</p><p>All the trial-takers who were too close were knocked off their feet by the huge force, and they vaguely felt the presence of death.</p><p>And this was only the first wave of the Saint Explosion!</p><p>When the core of power in the center of the underground world appeared, the entire Vermillion Bird lineage and even the three neighboring lineages trembled.</p><p>Vermilion Bird Golden Tower.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was still wiping away her tears when she was suddenly sent flying by a huge force.</p><p>She did not even know what had happened. When she looked up, the Vermilion Bird Golden Tower had also taken off and it flew even higher than her!</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>The sorrowful atmosphere that enveloped the surroundings was suppressed. Everyone was stunned..</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A pillar of light shot into the sky.</p><p>The destructive Holy Power was about to explode.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Above the Nine Heavens, a white crane flew into the gap of the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>As soon as he stepped onto the arena, Mu Ling, who sat on top of the crane, felt a huge pressure.</p><p>He had only received a message that Wei An was missing, so he had come to take over his duties and stand on guard.</p><p>He did not expect that the moment he arrived, the Four Symbols Secret Realm would be in such a chaotic state. The Saint war had even erupted right under his nose!</p><p>If he had come half a step later, would all the trial-takers in the Vermillion Bird lineage have died under this attack?</p><p>“Refine!”</p><p>Demi-saint Mu Ling showed his Flame of Annihilation without any further ado.</p><p>Up till today, after he became a Saint, he had consolidated his cultivation. He had also merged with the heavenly flame of the Flame of Annihilation.</p><p>Furthermore, when it came to rescue measures similar to explosions, Mu Ling could be said to be… vastly experienced!</p><p>With a thought, the entire Vermilion Bird lineage was filled with the boundless Flame of Annihilation and turned into a Dragon Melting Realm.</p><p>This realm was not a pure realm.</p><p>Instead, he used Heaven and Earth as a furnace and the explosion as medicine, and borrowed the momentum to turn it into Elixirs.</p><p>It was impossible for the Elixirs to be formed.</p><p>However, the conducting alchemy technique was all about explosions.</p><p>Mu Ling made a hand seal with both hands, and the explosive force broke down into many different forms. Each of them was like a medicinal liquid, but it did not explode for a short while. Instead, it swirled along with the flow and formed a ball.</p><p>Second Explosion Technique!</p><p>With the help of the delayed explosion, Mu Ling waved his sleeves and threw the ‘explosion’ that had been condensed into a power source seed outside the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Qilin world, in the sky above Gong Yang Mountain.</p><p>When the explosion occurred, the world darkened and the Path Principles collapsed.</p><p>The sound was so loud that almost all the132 worlds in the Central Region’s Holy Divine Land could hear it.</p><p>“Saint War?”</p><p>Everyone’s attention was focused on the sound, but they could only see a bit of light in the distance. They didn’t know what actually took place.</p><p>However, the Holy Power fluctuations were too clear!</p><p>This was definitely a Saint war!</p><p>For a moment, outside the Qilin World, the Cutting Path Stage and the higher void levels from all over the world approached. They wanted to watch the Saint war and find out about the actual situation of the Ran Ming ruins.</p><p>In the Four Symbols Secret Realm, the trial-takers and dust stones smashed to the ground.</p><p>Mu Ling, who used the skill that turned death into life, didn’t look happy at all. Instead, he remained silent as he hovered in the air.</p><p>What did he sense?</p><p>One of the explosive forces that had broken down just now was actually the infernal power?</p><p>“Explosion…”</p><p>“Ember Heart, Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Mu Ling’s face darkened.</p><p>Why can’t I be rid of you!</p><p>I’m your Martial Uncle, not your nanny. I can’t come out to solve the problems that were caused by you every time!</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The Vermilion Bird Golden Tower fell and stabbed into the ground and lost its spiritual quality.</p><p>Even if there was a quarter of the Holy Palace Trials in the Four Symbols Secret Realm, it would be a joke.</p><p>The ground had shattered and a huge pit appeared.</p><p>After it returned from the Holy Emperor Qilin’s shattered world, the Berserk Giant naturally returned to the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>It was too big!</p><p>It had grown to the size of the Holy Emperor Qilin.</p><p>As a result, the Berserk Giant was so large that even when it stood in the huge pit of the abyss, its chest was still level with the horizon.</p><p>All the trial-takers and trial officers who landed on the ground relied on Mu Ling’s power. They were only injured and did not die.</p><p>Everyone broke free from the sorrowful atmosphere. When they looked up, they suddenly sucked in a cold breath of air.</p><p>Only half of the Golden Giant’s chest was exposed, and its huge head was already thousands of feet high. It was like an underground creature that had suddenly awakened. When it stood up, this only emphasized the horror of its massive size!</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>“What kind of creature is this?”</p><p>“The explosion just now was because it woke up? It was part of a Giant Clan? Demi-saint?”</p><p>“Why is there such a creature in the Four Symbols Secret Realm? What is the Holy Palace thinking? Why are we even having our training here?”</p><p>The trial-takers were stunned.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen finally stepped on the foundation of the Golden Tower and looked up. She also saw the Golden Giant that was as tall as the sky.</p><p>Her reaction was different from the shock and unfamiliarity of the trial-takers.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was too familiar with this Golden Giant!</p><p>Back then, in the White Cave, when the lava erupted from the birth of the famed sword Flame Python, this giant protected her when it shielded her in its palm. This left a deep impression on her:</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you are indeed by my side…”</p><p>“+(Stunned, Passive Points),+135.”</p><p>“+( In Awe, Passive Points),+122.”</p><p>“+(Received Concern, Passive Points+)+1.”</p><p>The Information Bar popped up, and everyone looked at the Berserk Giant.</p><p>The Berserk Giant Xu Xiaoshou stared at Bei Huai’s soul body that stood in the void and was invisible to 99% of the trial-takers.</p><p>He had succeeded.</p><p>However, it did not successfully interrupt the connection between Bei Huai and the Apricot Realm.</p><p>Instead, he only managed to shock Bei Huai’s soul body and caused him to temporarily stop the invasion of the Apricot Realm.</p><p>At this moment, Bei Huai’s soul body looked down at the fist-sized hole in his chest.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>A strong burning sensation was felt in the hollow place, and dark green soul blood flowed out.</p><p>A Holy Emperor’s soul blood!</p><p>Bei Huai fell silent.</p><p>His soul body was injured by a Sovereign Dao Realm?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also fell silent.</p><p>His most powerful explosion only created such an insignificant hole?</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Without a word, Xu Xiaoshou terminated his Berserk Giant form and returned to his original body in the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>The second-in-command saint servant, the Tower Master of the First Pavilion in the Sky…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou himself!</p><p>He was no longer in disguise!</p><p>After his body shrank, the young man who stood in the sky had an imposing appearance. His facial features were handsome and his flawless body emitted a Holy Light.</p><p>There was a black sword, Hidden Bitter, at his waist. He carried Flame Python and Fourth Sword in his hands. All the passive skills in his body were activated, and the Heaven and Earth spiritual source whistled over.</p><p>At this moment, he was the focus of the world!</p><p>Everyone recognized this young man who was currently the most wanted criminal in the Holy Divine Palace!</p><p>“Xu… Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“Lord Shou?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou ignored the stares of the outsiders.</p><p>He exhaled deeply and touched the star diamond earring on his earlobe. He spoke clearly and spoke without hesitation.</p><p>“Aunt Xiang, save me!”</p><p>“It’s urgent! It’s very urgent!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
