It’s made by the high-ranking people for the low-ranking people, so that some people can get away with it, right?”</p><p>The trial-takers’ scalps went numb when they heard this.</p><p>They still couldn’t see what Yu Zhiwen fought against.</p><p>All they could see was that Yu Zhiwen’s body trembled and was distorted due to the immense pressure, but she held on!</p><p>No one dared to make fun of her.</p><p>At this moment, there was only respect in everyone’s eyes.</p><p>They would run away in fear due to the Holy Emperor’s name, but they could not condemn the determination of a light chaser.</p><p>The light chaser might never be able to catch up to the light.</p><p>However, if she could get a partial response to what she chased after, the light would be able to dispel the haze in any part of the world.</p><p>The power of the soul body hand did not decrease at all, and it was infinitely magnified in Yu Zhiwen’s eyes.</p><p>She simply closed her eyes and shouted at the top of her lungs,</p><p>“Ghost beasts are always in the wrong, and the Holy Emperor is always right, right?”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The void suddenly shook.</p><p>The intangible, magnificent soul hand that could destroy the world without any emotion and without any delay, slammed into Yu Zhiwen’s body.</p><p>“Peng, peng, peng…”</p><p>In an instant, all the jade beads and artifacts on Yu Zhiwen’s body exploded.</p><p>She spat out a mouthful of blood, and her body was sent flying like a kite that had its string cut off.</p><p>In the end, the Life Guard Emblem that was placed deep in her soul body appeared and shattered. Only then did Yu Zhiwen manage to preserve half of her life force from the Holy Emperor’s attack.</p><p>“Who dares to hurt my disciple?”</p><p>A faint voice suddenly came down from the Nine Heavens. Then, the starlight lit up as the light and shadows gathered and was about to turn into the thought incarnation of a demi-saint.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Bei Huai’s soul body roared.</p><p>The Path Principles of the Four Symbols Secret Realm shattered, and the Divine Patterns collapsed.</p><p>The demi-saint thought incarnation had yet to take form and was shattered by Bei Huai.</p><p>“Woo!”</p><p>Amid the broken black hole and the chaotic spatial fragments, the melodious and ethereal voice of Kun Peng suddenly came out.</p><p>The voice was tinged with sorrow and loneliness and filled the people with pure spiritual shock.</p><p>At the same time that Yu Zhiwen’s body exploded, all kinds of soul body spiritual weapons appeared. A huge dark blue fin that blotted out the sky and the sun suddenly emerged from the black hole.</p><p>It was so big that even the trial-takers couldn’t see its full form, let alone Kun Peng’s true body with its fins.</p><p>However, as soon as it appeared, the dark blue fin did not make any unnecessary movements. It directly slapped down on the head of Bei Huai’s soul body.</p><p>“Yu Kunpeng, watch your step!”</p><p>Bei Huai looked up and his eyes glowed with a dark light.</p><p>A dark green Holy Light rose from his head and turned into two palms that supported the sky.</p><p>In an instant, Heaven and Earth in the Four Symbols Secret Realm cried as it rained, and everyone mourned.</p><p>Kun Peng’s fins smashed into the soul hands and they instantly shattered amid the power of the primordial chaos.</p><p>However, with this connection, the green light in Bei Huai’s eyes seemed to use the fins to capture its master.</p><p>“Freeze!”</p><p>Kun Peng’s fin seemed to have been severed from its divine senses. Its consciousness and body seemed to separate. For a moment, it forgot where it came from and where it should go. It was frozen in the void.</p><p>Everything stopped!</p><p>No one could put up any resistance!</p><p>Dao Xuanji was only a demi-saint…</p><p>Yu Kunpeng was only a demi-saint…</p><p>Demi-Saints could be very strong, even stronger than the thought incarnation of an ordinary Holy Emperor. They could block a single strike.</p><p>However, in the eyes of Bei Huai, the peak expert of the way of the spirit and soul and one of the Ten High Nobles, all of them were like smoke and mist, weak and powerless.</p><p>Only his thought incarnation was here, but he could suppress everyone. There was no doubt about it!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen, who had almost fainted on the spot, looked on helplessly as the soul hand broke through all the restraints and directly grabbed Greedy the White Cat Spirit. Her Pearl Gem Star Eyes had already lost their light.</p><p>Bei Huai did not answer, nor did he bother to answer.</p><p>She seemed to have heard the answers to all her questions.</p><p>Yes, if one was strong enough, they could break all rules, ignore any restrictions, and do whatever they wanted!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s eyes were filled with tears of blood as she closed her eyes. She was powerless because she was weak, and she longed for someone to defy the Heavens and reverse her path.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>“Can you really…”</p><p>Weng!</p><p>In the shattered world of darkness, a dazzling Power Upanishad Formation suddenly lit up. Time was outlined as gears in it, and time transformed into a Dao technique inside.</p><p>At first, it was insignificant, born in a small space as it swayed and was about to shatter.</p><p>However, when the void completely condensed into a figure, the figure raised the illusory scepter in his hand and forcefully squeezed out the truth.</p><p>The entire Four Symbols Secret Realm shifted and attracted attention.</p><p>“Time, freeze!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
