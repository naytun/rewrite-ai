How could he inflict harm on a soul body? This hungry ghost… he must be a soul cultivator!”</p><p>“Are you daft? Haven’t you heard of ‘At the Gates of Hell, even The Divine is revered!’? If he didn’t have the ability to inflict damage on soul bodies, how could he have achieved divinity with just one battle? This is the ‘Hungry Ghost Path’!”</p><p>“The Hungry Ghost Path, what is it?”</p><p>“I have no idea, but didn’t he just mention the three words ‘Hungry Ghost Path’? It must be related to this…”</p><p>“Damn!”</p><p>The Divine’s punch was undeniably shocking.</p><p>At this moment, in the hearts of most spectators, the Holy Emperor was a term nearly forgotten.</p><p>But when Bei Huai gathered his momentum and materialized his soul body to the point where it was visible to the naked eye, everyone’s hearts were filled with nothing but awe.</p><p>They recalled what kind of existence a “Holy Emperor” was.</p><p>It was almost synonymous with “invincible.”</p><p>Yet, at this moment, an unexpected visitor burst into the battle, rushing into the Gate of Hell in human form, then transforming into a Hungry Ghost, and with a single punch, he sent the invincible Holy Emperor flying!</p><p>“The Divine is truly ferocious…”</p><p>“But brothers, haven’t you noticed a very important issue? He stands with the Saint Servant!”</p><p>As the first sober individual detached from the climax of the battle and looked towards the mastermind, others followed suit.</p><p>Looking up, all that remained in the high sky was a golden majestic throne.</p><p>Upon the throne, the Saint Servant Lord Shou ostentatiously lounged with his legs crossed, one hand stroking a cat, and the other playing with two giant cores… dragon apricot seeds.</p><p>Leaning lightly against the backrest, with his chin slightly raised and one corner of his mouth unmoving while the other was slightly lifted, his eyes brimmed with coldness and mockery.</p><p>He was putting on airs!</p><p>He even manipulated the golden throne in the void, slowly rotating it!</p><p>While Bei Huai was blasted away by a single blow, he attempted to steal The Divine’s thunder, as if he were the protagonist of this battle.</p><p>He tried his best to ensure that every single nose hair was visible to the spectators of the battle.</p><p>And when Bei Huai was truly punched away by The Divine, who had transformed into a Hungry Ghost, this Lord Shou suddenly stood up from the golden throne.</p><p>A flicker of excitement passed over his face, then he casually sat back down, crossing his legs again, and the dragon apricot seeds in his hand turned into imitations.</p><p>The world suddenly dimmed.</p><p>Above the dim sky, a light appeared, attracting everyone’s attention.</p><p>How coincidental!</p><p>This light just happened to fall directly on Lord Shou on the golden throne, amplifying his somewhat disdainful and nonchalant voice, spreading throughout the entire arena:</p><p>“Holy Emperor Bei Huai, I’m waiting for someone, what are you waiting for?”</p><p>“Death?”</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>In an instant, everyone’s scalp tingled.</p><p>To remain indifferent in the face of the Holy Emperor’s imminent attack, and then to show no mercy after the Holy Emperor was knocked flying.</p><p>Under the heavens, perhaps only Xu Xiaoshou was such an oddity!</p><p>“Saint Servant, Lord Shou…”</p><p>“It seems like there’s no such thing as a wrong nickname, only wrong names. This guy is truly a lord!”</p><p>“But how dare he? He should savor this moment on the golden throne. After today, he might not even be able to sleep peacefully, constantly worrying about sudden death!”</p><p>“Everyone, don’t forget, he’s the same age as us, or even… uh, younger. By normal standards, he should be undergoing the Holy Palace Trial with us…”</p><p>This unexpected remark completely silenced everyone.</p><p>Right!</p><p>Almost forgot!</p><p>Damn, he was actually quite young…</p><p>“Watched, Passive Points, +635.”</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points, +526.”</p><p>“Lauded, Passive Points, +568.”</p><p>“Received Concern, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen stared dumbfoundedly at the young man on the golden throne in the sky, who had stolen all the glory of the great battle with just a beam of light…</p><p>She suddenly laughed.</p><p>The laughter irritated her injuries, and Yu Zhiwen coughed heavily, her furrowed brows betraying the pain she was feeling.</p><p>But she kept laughing.</p><p>And she laughed heartily.</p><p>Covering her lips with the back of her hand, Yu Zhiwen continued to laugh, blood seeping from the corners of her mouth…</p><p>Yet she continued to laugh!</p><p>On the solemn sacred mountain, Yu Zhiwen had seen too many so-called saints who were pretentious, sanctimonious, and conceited.</p><p>They would meticulously smooth out even a single wrinkle on their clothes, always presenting their most composed and confident side to others.</p><p>They upheld saintly principles, proclaimed saintly orders, towering high above, never showing the base and vile faces of petty success under the public eye.</p><p>Even the elites on the Saint Mountain were adept at controlling their demeanor.</p><p>Either silent and sparing of words, every command was delivered with half a word, leaving the rest to be guessed by others, and if guessed wrong, there would be punishment.</p><p>Or solemn and righteous, self-proclaiming justice, Yu Zhiwen couldn’t really tell what they were like in private, nor did she want to know.</p><p>But the righteousness of those people on the surface was only a set of rules made for their own benefit, righteousness for a selected few, and not even the vast majority!</p><p>They behaved appropriately, shining brightly, and it was absolutely impossible for them to act like clowns in front of a large audience, seeking applause, and making such “eye-polluting” moves as Xu Xiaoshou did at the moment.</p><p>Yet, Yu Zhiwen watched every move of Xu Xiaoshou, which could be described as “corrupting the eyes and ears”, with pure joy!</p><p>She had lived on the Saint Mountain since she was a child, where she had seen too many “saints.”</p><p>It wasn’t until she escaped Saint Mountain, and entered the secular world, that she encountered many real “people.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
