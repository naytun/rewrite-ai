He separated out a wisp of his spiritual senses and read the Holy Emperor Qilin’s memories. He tried to use this method to touch its broken consciousness world and then communicate with the Qilin’s will.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>He suddenly felt dizzy.</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou did not sense the so-called gentle waves. Instead, it was replaced by the wails of numerous ghosts that swept over like a boundless tsunami.</p><p>“Howl!”</p><p>“Eeeee!”</p><p>“Ji!”</p><p>A series of ear-piercing screeches penetrated through his soul like needles.</p><p>The impenetrable soul body urn instantly captured Xu Xiaoshou’s split spiritual senses. It even tried to take advantage of this opportunity and attached itself onto Xu Xiaoshou’s soul body.</p><p>“+(Ambushed, Passive Points+)+1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat as he realized that he had been tricked!</p><p>That d*mned Bei Huai had already laid a trap and waited for him to touch the soul body of the Holy Emperor Qilin again!</p><p>“Yes…”</p><p>“My Time Ancestor Shadow Staff has the power of oblivion, and Bei Huai is only a remnant soul. He doesn’t have enough power, which is why I was able to trick him a second time.”</p><p>“But the Soul Reading doesn’t have that! Last time, it was through this method that I communicated with the Holy Emperor Qilin. After Bei Huai took over, he should know everything, so how could he not be on guard?”</p><p>The gecko would cut off its tail in order to survive.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cut off his spiritual senses without hesitation.</p><p>He was totally ruthless. His eyes had even turned into small dark swords as he formed the Phantom Swords Technique and cut off a portion of the soul that had been ‘contaminated’ by Bei Huai.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>His heart contracted as pain assaulted his whole being.</p><p>A large portion of the Ultimate Giant’s head suddenly turned black.</p><p>However, his passive skills started to circulate crazily and the transformation began as it repaired the damage to this portion of his soul body.</p><p>“D*mn it! D*mn it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had suffered such a calamity. Not only was he unable to progress with his attack, but it was also forcibly stopped amid the spatial fragment. He couldn’t help but feel his hair stand on end.</p><p>Greed is harmful!</p><p>Why was he so greedy?</p><p>With his half-baked soul body, how could he dare to bet on the fact that Bei Huai did not have complete control over the Holy Emperor Qilin? He was too naive!</p><p>This Ten High Nobles Bei Huai was too difficult to deal with. He was one of the most disgusting opponent he had ever met in his life… Xu Xiashou subtly kept this lesson in mind.</p><p>“The Ten High Nobles are all dogs. There is no way to defeat them; it’s like a path of no return.”</p><p>“Be careful, be careful, be careful!”</p><p>“Ha…”</p><p>A scornful laugh seemed to come from the Spiritual Universe.</p><p>The Heavenly Ancestor Red Scorched Hand could not destroy the Holy Emperor Qilin. Just when the spatial fragment suddenly stopped, Bei Huai made his move.</p><p>His soul sacrifice naturally had the power of guidance of the Holy Emperor. His goal was to let Xu Xiaoshou rely on his spiritual technique that could read one’s soul memory when he searched for a way to break it.</p><p>The trap that was left behind would naturally be triggered.</p><p>“Young people are indeed innocent and cute.”</p><p>“If I couldn’t control the Holy Emperor Qilin, would it have been so desperate that it was at my beck and call?”</p><p>“If I could leave such a big gap for you to steal, would you be the first person to have that opportunity?”</p><p>Not only was the Ultimate Giant not able to suppress the soul sacrifice, but it even caused the Holy Emperor Qilin’s aura to rise to its peak.</p><p>After he cut off his spiritual senses and soul body, he woke up again.</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin’s body was wrapped in the healing power of the Azure Dragon’s wood element, and its wounds were mostly healed.</p><p>It actually resisted the Heavenly Ancestor Red Scorched Hand and mobilized the source of the Saint beast’s bloodline talent. Its horn emitted a dazzling light.</p><p>“Heaven and Earth divine light!”</p><p>“Peng, peng, peng…”</p><p>The sky was filled with continuous sounds.</p><p>In the eyes of the world, the Ultimate Giant was truly violent!</p><p>It pressed down on the Holy Emperor Qilin’s head and threw it into the spatial fragment.</p><p>The power of the ancestral source and the Penetrating Divine Senses overlapped and destroyed the Saint beast’s body bit by bit, in an attempt to kill it.</p><p>This move was also a perfect success!</p><p>When the Heavenly Ancestor Red Scorched Hand, wrist, elbow, and even shoulder sank into the spatial fragment, it meant that the Holy Emperor Qilin had no way to resist.</p><p>In the main world, a subversive drama was about to take place where a Sovereign Dao Realm killed the true body of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>However, in just a short period of time…</p><p>The situation had changed!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>An earthen yellow divine light suddenly erupted from the spatial fragment and rushed into the sky.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, the divine light had actually penetrated the Heavenly Ancestor Red Scorched Hand’s palm and pierced through the Ultimate Giant’s chest and came out from its back!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>This attack was truly shocking.</p><p>“A junior will always be a junior?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou’s ability to reverse the giant wall with the power of time is already the limit of his skills. The Holy Emperor Qilin still has a backup plan that can break through his power!”</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The Ultimate Giant in the sky was knocked back by the force of the Recoil and retreated.</p><p>Its hand was blasted out of the spatial fragment.</p><p>The first step it took was very small. It had only retreated tens of thousands of miles away from Gong Yang Mountain. By the second step, it had already retreated from the battlefield.</p><p>At the third step, it felt a huge force explode in its body that caused all its strength to almost totally turn the tables. It retreated to the edge of the Qilin world and almost stepped into another realm.</p><p>“+(Startled, Passive Points,+)+1.”</p><p>When he used his Perception and probed the rapidly healing hole on the Heavenly Ancestor Red Scorched Hand. Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>He was really stunned!</p><p>Was this the power of the Holy Emperor Qilin’s true body?</p><p>A deadly strike from the extreme grounds could actually break through the combined defense of the Ultimate Giant, the Heavenly Ancestor’s body, and the Penetrating Divine Senses?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
