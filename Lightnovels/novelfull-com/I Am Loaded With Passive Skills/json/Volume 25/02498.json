He turned to the all-knowing Li Fugui.</p><p>“Uh, Lord Shou, you’re putting me in a tight spot here…” Li Fugui hesitated for a moment, then carefully said:</p><p>“Perhaps Hallmaster Dao did indeed sense someone spying.”</p><p>“But the power of the Divine Sorcerer lies in preparation. He should have seen it in the Shengshen Continent.”</p><p>“As for this realm, Hallmaster Dao probably hasn’t been here before, right? Perhaps the intrusion wasn’t detected?”</p><p>Upon careful thought, Jin Ren found this reasoning somewhat plausible.</p><p>If that old Dao had such a far-reaching vision, he would have turned around immediately.</p><p>But he was stuck in the final image before it disappeared, and there didn’t seem to be a focus in his gaze… right?</p><p>“Disgusting.”</p><p>Jin Ren felt nauseous.</p><p>The Divine Sorcerer, truly revolting.</p><p>But soon he felt resigned…</p><p>So, what if he saw?</p><p>Would he get pregnant from a glance from Elder Dao the Flamboyant?</p><p>“Next time, don’t show any images related to that person. I feel like throwing up.” Jin Ren looked at the spirit of the Dragon Apricot.</p><p>The spirit of the Dragon Apricot just nodded its proud dragon head.</p><p>The status of the ancestral tree made it impossible for it to apologize even if it knew it had done wrong.</p><p>Putting aside trivial matters, Jin Ren quickly returned his attention to the various Divine Secrets displayed by Dao Qiongcang earlier.</p><p>“How much do you know about the Divine Thirty-Six Form?” he asked Li Fugui.</p><p>Li Fugui took a deep breath and said solemnly:</p><p>“The Divine Thirty-Six Form is the most powerful Divine Secret technique refined by Hallmaster Dao, encompassing the essence of his lifelong learning, integrating teachings from various schools.”</p><p>“In his philosophy, Divine Secrets are as significant as the Way of Spiritual Cultivation or the Ancient Sword Technique, representing a Great Path that can mimic various attributes of spiritual cultivation through indirect means.”</p><p>“For example, the Greater Teleportation Technique replicates the power of teleportation through the Way of Spirit Arrays, creating a similar effect of spatial movement without being bound by one’s limitations, and can even teleport others and objects.”</p><p>“The Great Confinement Technique, learned from the Dead Sea, possesses the Force of Exile and shares some similarities with sealing attributes, but the concept is different. It can confine people and objects in a ‘bottle,’ which can be anything.”</p><p>“And then there’s the Great Killing Technique, one of the few Divine Secrets focused solely on combat strength, sacrificing other auxiliary abilities. Its lethality… well, it can be significant, but compared to its enigmatic properties, the direct combat strength of the Divine Sorcerer may not be as impressive.”</p><p>After a brief pause, Li Fugui sighed, “The Divine Thirty-Six Form covers a wide range, encompassing everything imaginable… These are the only three I know about.”</p><p>“What about the Great God Descending Technique?” Jin Ren pressed, as this was crucial, the centerpiece that forced the demi-saint to self-destruct!</p><p>Li Fugui knew Lord Shou was asking about that. He could only helplessly reply:</p><p>“Regarding the auxiliary-type Divine Thirty-Six Forms of Hallmaster Dao, Flower Pavilion has observed and recorded many of them, but only a few have been deciphered, and those are relatively ordinary.”</p><p>“As for the powerful and mysterious techniques, he mostly keeps them hidden. Outsiders cannot know about them. Those who have seen them either get captured or die.”</p><p>Too frustrating!</p><p>Jin Ren scratched his head, feeling uncomfortable all over.</p><p>He was adept at Weaving Expertise, which should have made it a breeze for him to see through the essence.</p><p>But the Divine Thirty-Six Form of Dao Qiongcang was mostly pre-packaged, presenting only visual effects—this was just the surface.</p><p>What lay beneath, the core Divine Arrays were all hidden.</p><p>The exposed divine path patterns, on the other hand, were merely disturbances in the information, easily decipherable by the Weaving Technique</p><p>This made it impossible to trace back to the essence of the divine path pattern, making it difficult to replicate his techniques…</p><p>It had to be said, that Elder Dao the Flamboyant was really good at theft prevention!</p><p>After silently contemplating for a while and clearing his thoughts, Jin Ren looked up at the spirit of the Dragon Apricot:</p><p>“Why do you think the Seven Trees Emperor transmitted this image to you? Was it the intention of Five Decays of Heaven and Man, or the Blood World Pearl?”</p><p>The spirit of the Dragon Apricot twisted its body, showing no interest in meddling in external affairs. It only cared about the safety of the Apricot Realm and whether the Herb Garden of the Divine Farmer was comfortable to sleep in.</p><p>Casually rolling up the Yin Branch of the Blood Tree within the Apricot Realm and injecting a bit of power into it, the spirit of the Dragon Apricot tossed it to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Take it. When necessary, you can contact the blood tree and reach out to that orange person.”</p><p>“As for your question, go find the answer yourself.”</p><p>Lazy!</p><p>Shameful!</p><p>It was the ancestral tree!</p><p>Couldn’t it learn from the blood tree? Even though it was trapped on the Inner Island, it was still struggling, attempting to meddle with the Shengshen Continent…</p><p>And what about it?</p><p>It was simply disgracing the Nine Great Ancestral Trees!</p><p>“Thank you, Senior.”</p><p>Jin Ren controlled his clone and tried hard to manage his expression, then asked, “What about the second bad news?”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man?</p><p>Jin Ren had already let go of that matter.</p><p>Even if he wanted to contact, his true self probably wouldn’t allow it.</p><p>After all, that person was a Body of Decay, excessive contact would breed contamination, inviting death.</p><p>The spirit of the Dragon Apricot glanced at the two in front of him, then saw a cat and a weasel peeking nearby through a spatial crack, and said in a solemn voice:</p><p>“Holy Emperor, descending upon the Shengshen Continent, once again.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
