Intermingled with them were the dried bones of several mountain search teams.</p><p>The skeleton was wearing a white or red robe.</p><p>The broken Heavenly Group communication device was scattered on the side but still stubbornly communicated the heavenly secret, sending out signals.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>However, nothing was sent out.</p><p>“Hundred Shattered…Mountain…”</p><p>“Roger…”</p><p>“Please return…”</p><p>The only communication device that was still in good condition was calling intermittently.</p><p>However, before the sound could be heard completely, a foot stepped on it.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>Gray mist gushed out.</p><p>The communication bead instantly decayed, and the divine path pattern appeared inside. It was about to record the scene near the person who destroyed the communication bead.</p><p>He paused.</p><p>The tiny bit of Holy Power contained in it seemed to have been sucked away and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Stepping over the bones, he walked forward.</p><p>Beneath the orange mask, Five Decays of Heaven and Man, not showing any emotions, took out the vibrating communication bead.</p><p>After being connected, the voice of Yama Huang Quan came from within.</p><p>“Two things.</p><p>“First, Lei Xi-er has passed the assessment and you will bring her along to carry out missions together. The mask will remain black. Be vigilant against the Daoist person.</p><p>“Second, the new Spatial Upanishad demi-saint should be Ye Xiaotian. Look for him and bring him here.”</p><p>It was as if he was avoiding the God of Plague.</p><p>When he finished speaking about the official business, the communication bead did not wait a while, and the conversation ended with a beep.</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man slowly responded and looked at the sky.</p><p>There were remnants of Holy Power in the sky, and they could faintly smell the scent of soul power belonging to the Holy Emperor, Bei Huai.</p><p>The next thing was the clear green wind power of the Holy Emperor, coming from the Wangze Holy Emperor.</p><p>He lowered his eyes.</p><p>The entire mountain was deathly silent.</p><p>It was unknown what he was thinking, but soon Five Decays of Heaven and Man unleashed his “demi-saint person.”</p><p>“Buzz…”</p><p>An obscure Crimson Light swept across the entire Hundred Shattered Beast Mountain and disappeared into the Central Yuan world at the edge of nowhere.</p><p>There was no wind on the mountain, no leaves on the branches, and no rustling sound.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man was stunned.</p><p>He now remembered that before he entered the Four Symbols Secret Realm, he had seen some fragments of this scene on Horn Peak and Antelope Peak.</p><p>At that time, he thought it was the Qilin world he left behind.</p><p>He never thought this sunken dry bone tomb was indeed the Central Yuan world.</p><p>“Is this my fault?”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s eyes were full of confusion but more numbness.</p><p>He actually knew he did not cause this but by the battle between the giant and the Holy Emperor.</p><p>The one who had caused the most damage to the continent was Bei Huai’s remnant soul, which had lost control at the last moment. It definitely did not just affect the Hundred Shattered Beast Mountain.</p><p>The only thing he had to do with this battle was…</p><p>In this battle, Five Decays of Heaven and Man accompanied Lei Xi-er to watch the entire battle silently.</p><p>But in the end, he did not make a move.</p><p>That was all.</p><p>Even if he had some connection to this battle because he had “watched” it and had some power of guidance of the Blood World Pearl…</p><p>There was nothing he could do.</p><p>When he realized he had to use the Blood World Pearl to communicate, the Blood World Pearl had already swallowed all the remaining spiritual strength from the corpses of the Hundred Shattered Beast Mountain after the battle.</p><p>The energy that rebounded had even consolidated his unstable Demi-Saint State.</p><p>I didn’t mean to kill. However, I was the Lone Star of the Heavenly Calamity.</p><p>Looking at the Blood World Pearl slowly rotating above his head and emitting a demonic red light, Five Decays of Heaven and Man fell silent.</p><p>Till now, he had yet to obtain a real semi-saint person to replace this item.</p><p>He had planned for a long time on Abyss Island and had already obtained Jiang Buyi’s semi-saint person. Sanctification was just around the corner.</p><p>However, Five Decays of Heaven and Man would be completely lost once the Water Ghost wore the face.</p><p>“Yan Wuse’s is with Water Ghost, and Rao Yaoyao’s is in Xu Xiaoshou’s hand.”</p><p>“Jiang Buyi’s semi-saint person has also fallen into the hands of the Saint Servant. If nothing unexpected happens, it has already been used by Cen Qiaofu…”</p><p>Rumors had it that Abyss Island had the foundational roots of Saint Ascension. It seemed like it was true.</p><p>At the very least, Five Decays of Heaven and Man had encountered several sanctification opportunities and finally became a Saint on that island.</p><p>However, when he returned to the Shengshen Continent, he couldn’t even find a trace of the semi-saint person or other items he could use for replacement.</p><p>“Blood World Pearl…”</p><p>The bead above his head was even more demonic than before. Five Decays of Heaven and Man stared at it for a long time and said slowly, “You’re already full. You should help me for once.</p><p>“If you’re only taking without giving, even I don’t want to be used by you. It’s better to die in glory than live in dishonor. Do you understand?”</p><p>The Blood World Pearl buzzed and projected a light shadow.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man saw a lofty mountain peak. Inside, a white-haired Daoist child was in front of the mysterious giant door on the mountain peak.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian?</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man could recognize this person. He shook his head saying, “This is a Spatial Upanishad demi-saint. It was okay in the past, but now I’m unsure if I can take him down.”</p><p>“He’s still of use to Huang Quan. I can only take a detour. I can’t confront him directly.</p><p>“Therefore, he is not my destiny.”</p><p>Blood World Pearl retracted its light and continued to spin, but it did not provide any more images.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man fell silent.</p><p>This thing had devoured countless undead and power in Hundred Shattered Beast Mountain. It had only fed back a little, but he had also gained a lot.</p><p>At least for a few months, he would not have to consider replacing the semi-saint person.</p><p>One could imagine how much Blood World Pearl had devoured this time!</p><p>But…</p><p>Could he always rely on Blood World Pearl?</p><p>It was the root of calamity, and the guide to death. It was still the same old phrase. Blood World Pearl was a Great Psionic Weapon that allowed its holders to see the place of their death.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
