Even death might be a luxury.</p><p>“But now, I can easily destroy this.”</p><p>The Power Upanishad Formation flashed and disappeared. Ye Xiaotian did not want to enter, but that did not mean he could not destroy the remaining Holy Emperor’s power.</p><p>He didn’t even need to move and continued to hover in the air, regulating his breath. He just needed a single thought.</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>A few important space nodes had collapsed inside the portal.</p><p>He believed that the remaining Holy Emperor’s power would soon collapse and return to nature’s spiritual energy circulation system.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian retracted his gaze, feeling slightly satisfied with his strength after becoming a demi-saint.</p><p>The strongest!</p><p>Unstoppable!</p><p>It was just that without the first battle, there was no way to verify his strength.</p><p>“How good would it be if a Holy Emperor came to fight with me…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou can actually fight a Holy Emperor…”</p><p>“He’s simply ridiculous…”</p><p>As his thoughts drifted away, Ye Xiaotian’s mind returned to his energy reserve. Everything was calm.</p><p>The people of the Qilin Realm and the Central Yuan world watched as the white-haired Daoist Child in the sky disappeared after becoming a demi-saint. Even the shattered spatial passageway that gave everyone a terrifying feeling was disintegrating bit by bit.</p><p>Everyone finally felt the peace that only came after the battle had truly ended.</p><p>A derailed world…</p><p>A derailed life…</p><p>Finally, they returned to the normal track.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>At this moment, the Divine Array Wheel suddenly emitted a blazing blood-red light.</p><p>The red liquid was like sticky water as it flowed into the gaps between Xuan Wuji’s fingers.</p><p>Xuan Wuji, who was hiding in the cave, felt his scalp go numb. With a bang, the cave shattered and he broke out of the rock.</p><p>The sky turned green.</p><p>The wind came from nowhere.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Xuan Wuji let out a shrill cry.</p><p>He did not even dare to wait for Ye Xiaotian to come and pick him up. Instead, he took out the teleportation portal disk.</p><p>“This?”</p><p>He quickly sensed that the space node of the surrounding world had been completely destroyed. He could not help but curse.</p><p>At this moment, the world seemed to be left with only wind elements.</p><p>Teleporting in this way meant there was a high chance that he would be lost in the dimensional debris or randomly teleported to a place called “Wind” which was definitely unsafe.</p><p>“Boundary Stellar Array!”</p><p>Xuan Wuji pulled out an array wheel from his chest and threw it into the sky.</p><p>With a bang, the array wheel shattered. The complicated and profound divine path pattern shot out and instantly enveloped the entire Hundred Shattered Beast Mountain ruins.</p><p>This array wheel used the Great Path of Divine Secret to collect the remaining power of the World War. It could instantly construct a defense array at the peak of the demi-saint realm.</p><p>What he had planned before was actually to protect the Qilin Realm and the Central Yuan world under the request of Bazhun’an, but he didn’t need to use it.</p><p>At this moment, Xuan Wuji was using it to protect himself.</p><p>He didn’t even dare to let the Boundary Stellar Array cover the land of the two realms. He only protected the ruins of the Hundred Shattered Beast Mountain where he was.</p><p>The range was reduced, and the defense was greatly improved!</p><p>This was a Divine Array Wheel controlled by a Divine Sorcerer. It had the ability to adapt!</p><p>However…</p><p>Even such a complicated great array could only protect the Hundred Shattered Beast Mountain and block the external influence…One breath of time!</p><p>“Ka-”</p><p>Storms gathered.</p><p>However, due to the aftershock, the Divine Secrets Array collapsed.</p><p>The people of the Central Yuan world looked up. They belatedly sensed that the strangeness had broken the silence and was growing wildly.</p><p>With a buzzing sound, a dazzling Power Upanishad Formation bloomed in the sky of the entire Central Yuan world.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian ended his attempt to stabilize his cultivation base with his legs crossed in advance. His expression changed drastically, and he roared in a shrill voice,</p><p>“I was just joking!”</p><p>“A Holy Emperor really appeared?”</p><p>He looked up and saw that the last bit of power in the collapsed teleportation passageway had been destroyed by the wind element power.</p><p>Green gathered.</p><p>A giant finger appeared above his head.</p><p>It came from the sky above the distant Jade Capital City and the Stairway to Heaven. In an instant, it entered the boundaries of the Central Yuan world and locked onto Ye Xiaotian and Xuan Wuji.</p><p>Azure Finger!</p><p>“Wangze Holy Emperor…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s face turned pale when he recognized the finger.</p><p>He knew that after being locked onto by the Holy Emperor, there was nowhere to run or hide.</p><p>His hands pierced through the void and directly tore off the sky of the Central Yuan world that had just been repaired.</p><p>“Hand of Ripping Heaven!”</p><p>The Sky of Central Yuan turned into the toughest shield.</p><p>Under Ye Xiaotian’s push, it managed to block the attack from the Azure Finger in time.</p><p>“Crack-”</p><p>The spatial shield shattered.</p><p>As if struck by lightning, Ye Xiaotian spat out a mouthful of blood and was sent flying backward, crashing toward the Hundred Shattered Beast Mountain.</p><p>In a head-on clash, his cultivation realm had yet to stabilize, and he was directly injured by the backlash!</p><p>“Why would Wang Ze Holy Emperor suddenly attack us?”</p><p>When he fell into Xuan Wuji’s arms, Ye Xiaotian was still baffled and terrified.</p><p>He did not really join the Saint Servant.</p><p>He had only appeared at the wrong time, but he had stopped the mad Holy Emperor from destroying the world. This was an act of “justice”!</p><p>As for Xu Xiaoshou, who managed to escape from the calamity because of Ye Xiaotian’s actions, it was only because he, Ye Xiaotian, was merciful and could not bear to see the people in the Central Yuan world being plunged into misery and suffering. Hence, he was used by Xu Xiaoshou.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
