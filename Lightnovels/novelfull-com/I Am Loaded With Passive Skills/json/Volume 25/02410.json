Was that also the ‘swallow’ force?”</p><p>A flash of orange appeared in Xu Xiaoshou’s mind. His thoughts were like a clap of thunder in the rain, and he was suddenly shocked.</p><p>He began to wonder if he had overthought things.</p><p>However, during the battle with Number Two in the First Hall of Sins, the voice of the Divine Oracle exploded in his mind again.</p><p>“The Body of Devour has triggered the second law of protection. I, the Divine Oracle, request to remove the restriction…”</p><p>Everything was traceable!</p><p>When he thought of this, Xu Xiaoshou had goosebumps all over his body.</p><p>That’s right. Back then, in the First Hall of Sins, the Divine Oracle suddenly turned on his full power. Could it be because his enemy was too strong?</p><p>No!</p><p>Not only that!</p><p>Most likely, it was because in the Divine Oracle’s database, the power of the Body of Devour, that even Bei Huai coveted, was too terrifying. Once it appeared, it had to be immediately sealed up!</p><p>“Why didn’t I notice it before…”</p><p>Some people were not compatible with the Lei Family’s Eyes, but he was outrageous enough to be compatible with the Five Extreme Physiques!</p><p>Even if that body had yet to take shape, he would break it and then re-form it. He would force it to take shape and then swallow it!</p><p>What Bei Huai lost was the Five Decays of Heaven and Man?</p><p>“What about the Greedy the Cat Spirit?”</p><p>“If Greedy the Cat Spirit fell into Bei Huai’s hands, would it still be able to survive?”</p><p>Xu Xiasohou’s thoughts had all dried up. Thousands of thoughts finally merged into a terrifying imagination:</p><p>Bei Huai, a Holy Emperor level was the Five Decays of Heaven and Man?</p><p>“Your soul is boiling.”</p><p>The barefooted, white-robed Bei Huai’s face was hidden in the haze.</p><p>His words were extremely light, but when he spoke again, it gave off a cold feeling like the Nine Sereneties.</p><p>“Found it…”</p><p>He didn’t care what Xu Xiaoshou knew from his words or what his thoughts were.</p><p>The process was not important, the result was the one that mattered.</p><p>The boiling soul had nowhere to hide, and everything connected to this soul, including the world, could be traced.</p><p>There were many in the five regions of the Shengshen Continent who cultivated the way of spirit and soul, but very few experts.</p><p>There was only one person who could be called a Holy Emperor.</p><p>Naturally, other than Bei Huai, very few people knew about it.</p><p>All existences were controlled by the divine soul.</p><p>When one looked at the leaves and traced it back to the roots, there were thousands of things to find.</p><p>“This is your world?”</p><p>Bei Huai slowly stretched his hand out and pointed toward the crying Qilin and the giant.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Apricot Realm shook.</p><p>The World Tree Dragon Apricot could no longer stay hidden and it lit up with a buzz.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit merged with its main body, and the ancestral tree transformed into a golden pattern embedded with rules. It bloomed with the power of protection outside this world.</p><p>If someone were to enter the space-time debris at this moment, there was a very small chance that they would see this scene:</p><p>In the darkness, the dark green hand of the soul opened wide and imprisoned a world.</p><p>The newborn world was as weak as a baby in swaddling clothes. Fortunately, this baby also contained supreme power hidden in its body.</p><p>The ancestral tree Dragon Apricot suddenly appeared. The crown of the tree flourished, and the golden light that scattered about in the sky resisted the grasp of the dark green divine soul hand.</p><p>Among the shattered space-time fragments, silent and violent power splattered about and affected countless space nodes.</p><p>The Apricot Realm was not on Xu Xiaoshou’s body, but at any node in the space-time debris of the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>Bei Huai’s attack was not aimed at the node of the shattered world under the Vermilion Bird Golden Tower. It could have been any black hole within any of the five regions.</p><p>Naturally, when the power of the ancestral tree Dragon Apricot and Bei Huai’s divine soul hand engaged in a tug-of-war, the violent splattering of energy did not only affect the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>It also affected the main body of the Shengshen Continent!</p><p>“Boom boom…”</p><p>All over the five regions, whether it was the forest, the river, the sea, the city, or the suburbs, explosions occurred everywhere.</p><p>As long as the corresponding space node of the Land Realm was adjacent to the Apricot Realm, the power in the space-time fragment would affect them without exception.</p><p>Natural disasters occurred everywhere, and strange lights appeared in the world.</p><p>Some people saw the dark green color, some saw the golden light spots, some encountered a storm, and some were reduced into powder by the energy…</p><p>Calamity came from the shattered space and randomly favored any unfortunate person.</p><p>In just a short moment, the five regions of the Holy Divine Palace received news of more than ten thousand natural disasters that occurred. They were random and disorderly and created utter confusion among the people.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit’s exhausted roar sounded.</p><p>It could only utter one name and could not split its attention to make more sounds.</p><p>However, as the master, how could Xu Xiaoshou not know that the Apricot Realm was in trouble at this moment!</p><p>And at this critical moment…</p><p>Jin Ren still clung onto the Holy Emperor Qilin and both cried bitterly without any regard for their image…</p><p>“Cry, cry, cry. You only know how to cry every day. What’s the use of crying!” Xu Xiaoshou could not take it anymore. He cursed and vented his anger on Jin Ren but he suddenly switched his will back.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
