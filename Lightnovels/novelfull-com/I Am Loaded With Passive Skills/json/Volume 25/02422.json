After delivering control and nauseating him, he hastily interrupted the move.</p><p>Then, he raised his gaze again.</p><p>“Soul Reading!”</p><p>Bei Huai opened his mouth and spat out a miniature version of himself, once again subjected to the force of control.</p><p>A surge of irritation flooded his mind!</p><p>“You’re so annoying…”</p><p>But before the word “annoying” could fully leave his lips, Xu Xiaoshou employed the same tactic again:</p><p>“Soul Reading!”</p><p>Bei Huai spat out another small soul body, blocking the control, but his voice was also stifled.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou swapped to the Spirit Dao Disc beneath his feet.</p><p>At that moment, he distinctly saw the divine soul of Bei Huai, which had remained motionless throughout, emitting a faint blue mist, like steam rising from boiling water.</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>Then he concealed his expression, replaced it with a cold gaze, and with a calm tone, he said slowly:</p><p>“Your soul is boiling~”</p><p>…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Four Symbols Secret Realm shook violently.</p><p>It seemed as though the world was about to collapse.</p><p>All the spiritual cultivators immersed in the sea of emotions suddenly found themselves freed from it.</p><p>With tearful eyes, they looked towards the position near the Vermilion Bird Golden Tower, where a visible, towering soul body appeared like a giant.</p><p>Bei Huai was furious!</p><p>The soul body of the Holy Emperor’s thought incarnation, condensing all his power, manifested as something tangible, visible to mortals!</p><p>With absolute power, he aimed to break Xu Xiaoshou’s nauseating tricks.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>This time, Bei Huai delivered a powerful strike with his manifested divine soul hand.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou voluntarily lifted the spatial exile. Bei Huai’s strike landed like a blow on cotton, leaving him thoroughly uncomfortable.</p><p>“Friend, you seem anxious~”</p><p>“Insect, have you finally given up struggling?!”</p><p>Bei Huai’s angry voice echoed far and wide.</p><p>Undoubtedly, Xu Xiaoshou, who had lost the power to restrain his enemy, couldn’t withstand even one strike from the Holy Emperor.</p><p>The only way out was to flee.</p><p>“No, I’m closing the door,” Xu Xiaoshou said with an unexpected smile.</p><p>“Closing the door?”</p><p>Bei Huai almost laughed out of anger.</p><p>That crude exile technique was broken with a flick of his hand.</p><p>“Since you want to close the door, let me show you what a ‘closed door’ means, where even the divine soul has nowhere to escape!”</p><p>“Soul Capturing Realm!”</p><p>Bei Huai’s soul body raised both hands.</p><p>Beyond the Four Symbols Secret Realm, enormous divine soul chains appeared, sealing off the small world in all directions, much like the sealing of the Apricot Realm.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t run!</p><p>He couldn’t take Greedy the Cat Spirit with him either!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had said that Bazhun’an would never risk himself by appearing in a battle to save others, so from start to finish, everything was within his grasp. Xu Xiaoshou was now cornered…</p><p>Bei Huai knew this.</p><p>The only thing he didn’t understand was why, up to this moment, Xu Xiaoshou was still smiling, as if victory belonged to him, not Bei Huai.</p><p>Even the Power Upanishad Formation beneath his feet had transformed into a divine soul, eagerly staring at him.</p><p>“What are you laughing at?” Bei Huai regretted asking this question; he shouldn’t have initiated the conversation.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shrugged, and a golden throne materialized in the void.</p><p>He sat down and even crossed his legs, as if relaxing before death, leaning back against the throne’s backrest.</p><p>With one hand stroking the cat and the other picking out a frozen cylinder formed by the Three Days Frozen Calamity, he ignited it with infernal white flame…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
