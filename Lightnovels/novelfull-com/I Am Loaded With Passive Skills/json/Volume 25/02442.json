He knew them all.</p><p>As long as one fought with him, they would definitely be able to experience a thing or two of those elegant demeanors that they might never experience in their entire life.</p><p>Even if one were to die in the evening, to have learned the path in the morning is fulfilling.</p><p>This saying was for this moment!</p><p>Not to mention that Xiao Qixiu had some conflict with Bazhun’an, and his disciple, Su Qianqian, had her sword stolen and her clan exterminated by him.</p><p>To endure until now, Old Xiao’s temperament had grown.</p><p>However, everyone knew that Bazhun’an was not afraid of the consequences of the challenge…</p><p>The lessons of the past were vividly displayed anew.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian would never let anything happen to Old Xiao.</p><p>However, he was only confident that he could teleport this person away at a critical moment.</p><p>However, whether he would succeed or not, whether Xiao Qixiu was willing or not, it was still another matter.</p><p>“Old Xiao…”</p><p>A sorrowful expression appeared on his face.</p><p>He really could not understand the temperament of these swordsmen. Life was clearly so beautiful. Moreover, they had already endured for an entire night. Would they die if they endured a little more?</p><p>“Put the sword down.”</p><p>Unexpectedly, Bazhun’an was calm and appeared reluctant to accept the challenge.</p><p>He slowly turned around and looked at Xiao Qixiu with his yellow eyes. He shook his head and said,</p><p>“I am unable to engage in combat, and I won’t draw my sword because of you.”</p><p>“If you really want to attack me, they will be the ones who will respond to you.”</p><p>Bazhun’an glanced at Storyteller and Xuan Wuji.</p><p>Xuan Wuji didn’t care. He had seen too many hotheads. There were so many Holy Emperors on the Inner Island, but they didn’t want to fight against Bazhun’an. It could only be said that there were many talented people in the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>“Who are you?” Storyteller couldn’t help but ask.</p><p>He didn’t even know where this swordsman named Xiao Qixiu came from. How could he be worthy of challenging his brother?</p><p>Xiao Qixiu turned a deaf ear to him. His eyes were bloodshot and his fighting spirit was cold.</p><p>Bazhun’an could tell that this person’s Way of the Sword had indeed changed. He was no longer a Tiansang swordsman.</p><p>“If you succeed in your path and fight for your name, I will no longer be your touchstone, but the Seven Sword Deity will be.”</p><p>Bazhun’an smiled and threw the stone into the lake.</p><p>The lake rippled, and the blue sky and white clouds shattered. He said softly,</p><p>“The Fen Qin Zhu He that walked out of this lake can fight against the heavens and is the ruler of darkness.”</p><p>“Ye Xiaotian, who walked out of this lake, has perfected his Upanishad final stage and breakthrough his Cutting Path stage. He’s only half a step away from becoming a Saint.”</p><p>“Similarly, Xu Xiaoshou walked out of this lake. In just a short year and a half, his achievements are almost above yours.”</p><p>Bazhun’an looked back at Xiao Qixiu, who was still in a daze.</p><p>“You’re in the lake, they’re outside.”</p><p>“You are self-aware that you have succeeded in the path and have no regard for anything. This is your ending after the illusory flower and moon…”</p><p>Following his finger, everyone looked at the center of the lake.</p><p>The fat goose on the lake lowered its head and with a snap, it caught the fish in the lake and swallowed it without even chewing.</p><p>“You will die when you come out of the water unless you transform into a dragon!”</p><p>Xiao Qixiu was stunned, unable to speak for a long time. At some point, the sword in his hand had already been lowered.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was taken aback. Wasn’t Bazhun’an’s words the same as Elder Sang’s warning to them not to remain stuck in this tiny Spirit Palace every time he returned from his travels? It turned out that he could have broken through decades earlier…</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi was dazed. What he saw was the two patterns merging at a perfect node. Life was merging, and power was subliming. His eyes shone brightly, and his scalp opened bit by bit. His eyes widened.</p><p>“So that’s how it is, so that’s how it is…”</p><p>No one paid attention to this fifty-year-old who had fallen behind and was casually comprehending. Xuan Wuji looked at Qiao Qianzhi as if he had sensed something.</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi tensed up and stroked his beard. He laughed and brought up a certain subject. “I see. The goose meat is so delicious because it ate the spiritual fish. I thought of a new recipe– Dragonized Goose!”</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>Everyone broke away from the mysterious concept just now, and their expressions were strange.</p><p>Xuan Wuji frowned and looked away.</p><p>He’s sick…</p><p>‘Although I’m also sick in the head, I feel that this person is extraordinary…’</p><p>“Beep.”</p><p>A soft sound rang out.</p><p>Bazhun’an smiled as he took out a communication bead and looked at the crowd with different expressions.</p><p>“He’s here.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
