Today’s the perfect opportunity, we can have some fun…”</p><p>The law enforcers suppressed their excitement, communicating with the new boss telepathically.</p><p>As the identities of Lord Shou, Spirit Palace Sleeveless, and the Dean, Spatial Upanishad Ye Xiaotian, were exposed and each departed from the Spirit Palace, little did they know that the reputation of the Tiansang Spirit Palace in the vicinity would become terrifying!</p><p>Even the Holy Palace struggled to produce so many wolves, yet the small Spirit Palace had produced three!</p><p>So much time had passed, and yet today’s Spirit Palace had remained peaceful, with no one daring to lay a finger on it.</p><p>This rendered the Spiritual Law Division virtually useless.</p><p>The newly appointed law enforcers eagerly awaited encountering a strong enemy, eager to whip them severely to vent their frustration.</p><p>Little did they know, in their mundane drills… no, crisis exercises, Zhao Xidong, the mighty leader who usually dominated, now appeared as weak as a wilted plant, unable to utter a single word.</p><p>Just as all the law enforcers were puzzled, they saw their new leader Zhao Xidong scream and hysterically shout:</p><p>“Dean, save me!!!”</p><p>Huh?</p><p>Why was it so different from the usual exercises?</p><p>This blood-curdling cry tore through the sky from the Outer Yard, disturbing the Inner Yard and startling countless disciples who were practicing through the night.</p><p>As the disciples puzzled over the situation, they looked up and saw the Palace Guarding Array suddenly activate, realizing that a major enemy was attacking.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>Spatial waves rippled in the void, and Xiao Qixiu, wielding his sword, flashed out from the Inner Yard, appearing above Goose Lake in an instant, his aura extraordinary.</p><p>“Who dares…”</p><p>His words faltered as he reached for the spiritual sword at his back, his action ceasing as he looked down.</p><p>As he glanced down, Xiao Qixiu saw the eight-fingered man supported by a man in a red robe.</p><p>Bazhun’an?</p><p>What was this guy doing at the Spirit Palace?!</p><p>Unbearable memories resurfaced…</p><p>Xiao Qixiu subconsciously tried to call for Elder Sang, only to realize he was no longer there.</p><p>He wanted to call for Ye Xiaotian, only to recall that he had “betrayed” the Palace.</p><p>“Qiao Qianzhi!”</p><p>He shouted in frustration, completely lacking confidence that he alone could face Bazhun’an, not to mention the Saint Servant Storyteller and the new face with an aura roughly at the higher void level.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Special spiritual veins appeared in the void.</p><p>“Huh? You are…”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi’s dubious and flabbergasted face appeared, half of his face concealed, his lower body solidifying, and his eyes trembled as the special spiritual veins froze in the void.</p><p>His lower half vanished, as did half of his face, leaving no trace of his presence.</p><p>“Qiao Qianzhi!!!”</p><p>Xiao Qixiu was infuriated to the point of nearly bursting with rage.</p><p>But Old Qiao was cowering, leaving all the pressure to himself as the Inner Yard Dean.</p><p>“What are you doing here?”</p><p>Xiao Qixiu gritted his teeth, restraining himself from drawing his sword.</p><p>Not drawing his sword left him feeling insecure, yet drawing it would put everyone at risk—this was too agonizing!</p><p>“I remember you.”</p><p>Bazhun’an raised his head, pondering for a moment before smiling. “But it’s been a long time; you seem to have… improved a bit?”</p><p>Phew.</p><p>He had to rein it in!</p><p>Now that Elder Sang was gone, there was no one to clean up the mess if things got out of hand at the Spirit Palace.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
