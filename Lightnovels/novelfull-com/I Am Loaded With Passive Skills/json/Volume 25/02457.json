I took care not to let her suffer any calamities and ensured she was not defiled by the Bei Huai clan…The materials used were all Saint Stage spiritual objects, but after she was born, she only had a first-grade aura. Perhaps my expectations were too high. I should reflect on this.”</p><p>The white-robed and barefooted Bei Huai wrote with great concentration.</p><p>The last paragraph was three pages long and detailed the process of Ah Ya’s third reincarnation.</p><p>When he was about to stop writing, a scream suddenly came from beside him.</p><p>“What? How could you eat her? She’s so pitiful.”</p><p>Bei Huai was startled. He glanced over and realized that the Bei Huai, who had been playing with the wooden rocking horse, was sprawled across Ah Ya’s grave.</p><p>The remains of the first-grade spiritual herb, Ah Ya, that had just broken out of the ground, had been swallowed.</p><p>Bei Huai’s mouth opened and his eyes shifted a little. Soon, the corners of his lips curled up slightly.</p><p>He continued to write in the Bei Huai’s Life Research Diary.</p><p>“Very interesting. Ah Ya’s birth has piqued Ah Le’s interest. She’s been eaten!”</p><p>“Survival of the fittest is the law of the jungle. I won’t interfere too much, nor will I punish them. Although Ah Le’s action angered me, but it’s just a small matter.”</p><p>“One should take note that Ah Le is a fool. He had never been interested in other living beings before. He’s a loner and only likes wooden rocking horses.”</p><p>“Ah Le took a wisp of the demi-saint Jiang Buyi’s soul, from the Pu Xuan Jiang Clan in the Northern Region and used the spiritual powder and the body rejuvenating pollen from the ghost beast Changyi. Changyi is a giant snake at the Higher Void State.”</p><p>“Perhaps it was because Changyi was too weak that it could not give birth to Ah Le. For this reason, I added the powder from the ancient japonicum into it. This process naturally obliterated the spiritual quality of the ancient japonicum. This was to prevent the increase in the number of research variables and also any accidents.”</p><p>“An accident. As expected, it still happened.”</p><p>“After Ah Le was born, he only liked wooden horses made from the branches of the ancient japonicum tree and rocking for fun. He was not interested in anything else and could not even speak.”</p><p>“Today, he ate Ah Ya, and I was enlightened. This meant that there must be something special about Ah Ya…”</p><p>Bei Huai stopped writing.</p><p>He reached behind him and pulled out another thick yellowing notebook.</p><p>The first page was the cover of the book and there were a few large characters written on it:</p><p>“The Bei Huai Clan’s record book.”</p><p>He flipped open the record book and the white-robed, barefooted Bei Huai quickly finished reading all the basic life information about Ah Ya, Ah Le, and even the Changyi.</p><p>After he compared the record with what he recalled in his memory and found no flaws, he checked, added, deleted, and corrected the details.</p><p>Just as he finished writing, he heard footsteps coming from the side.</p><p>Bei Huai looked up and saw the chubby little Ah Le, who was only a month old running around the wooden horse happily as he held his head.</p><p>This was too abnormal!</p><p>According to the record book, Ah Le did not like running or even walking. He only liked wooden horses and could not talk.</p><p>But now, Ah Le cheered happily as he ran.</p><p>“This Saint has grown grass!”</p><p>“This Saint has grown grass!”</p><p>Bei Huai’s eyes slowly turned dull.</p><p>Ah Le, you can talk now?</p><p>There was only one sentence in the content, and…</p><p>He looked at the chubby little Ah Le’s head. There was indeed a tender green stalk of grass that grew out of it. It was the one that he had observed just now, the one that had been eaten…</p><p>“Ah Ya?”</p><p>Bei Huai took a deep breath, bit the tip of his pen, and sank into deep thought.</p><p>“This Saint has grown grass!”</p><p>“This Saint has grown grass!”</p><p>Ah Le seemed to have fallen into an endless loop. His hands were too short to reach the grass on his head. No one knew how he found out that grass had grown on his head. He just clutched his head and ran around with the wooden horse.</p><p>Bei Huai’s thoughts were interrupted repeatedly and he could not help being a little irritated.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Ah Le acted as if he did not hear him. He continued to clutch his head and ran around the wooden horse.</p><p>“This Saint has grown grass!”</p><p>“This Saint has grown grass!”</p><p>Bei Huai stood up and kicked Ah Le away. At the same time, he flung the wooden horse far away. The noise immediately stopped.</p><p>“This Saint has grown grass…”</p><p>“Grown grass…”</p><p>“Grass…”</p><p>Bei Huai flipped through the Bei Huai record book and his gaze finally landed on the Bei Huai life research diary. He sighed helplessly.</p><p>“Time to get up.”</p><p>The diary trembled, and the pages flipped and rustled, as if it was stretching and moaning at the same time.</p><p>“I have to change the latest content.”</p><p>The diary stopped at the latest page.</p><p>The contents were deleted word by word until it reached the second line.</p><p>“Stop.”</p><p>As soon as Bei Huai spoke, the diary lost its vitality breath. There were only two sentences left on it:</p><p>“Year 13233 of the ancient tree calendar. The weather was cloudy and there was a light breeze.”</p><p>“The air on the mountain is still fresh. The breeze is mixed with the drizzle that brought with it the fragrance of the soil after yesterday’s rain. This makes one feel happy.”</p><p>Bei Huai thought for a moment, then crossed out the last few words and changed it to:</p><p>“This is ridiculous.”</p><p>“It’s really ridiculous.”</p><p>“My current feelings are extremely complicated…”</p><p>He recorded Ah Ya’s birth, but the focus was on what Ah Le said and his strange actions and the shocking fact that Ah Ya had grown even after he ate Ah Ya.</p><p>“… Was this ‘parasitism’ or ‘symbiosis’? Or was it a new life form?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
