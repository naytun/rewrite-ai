He said in disdain.</p><p>“Friend, you’re very anxious.”</p><p>“Why would a high and mighty Holy Emperor like you disregard your status and forcefully attack a weak woman?”</p><p>“Is it because she touched your sore spot, opened your scar, and ripped off the belief that ‘all ghost beasts are evil’ and pulled you down from the highest altar in the spiritual realm?”</p><p>“In this way, you can use a self deception method to tell yourself, ‘Oh, I’ve already spared her once. This time, it’s not about bullying the weak. If she offends me again, I’ll have to kill her’… Is that so?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou spoke brazenly in the frozen time.</p><p>He put down the scepter he held in his hand and took a deep breath. It was as if a fierce sword had shot out of his mouth and issued a Time Freeze so that everyone could hear his angry rebuke.</p><p>“Holy Emperor Bei Huai, can you be any more shameless?!”</p><p>This soul wrenching voice that was filled with Holy Power was like the words Bei Huai had said to Yu Zhiwen that spread to all the spectators.</p><p>It was transmitted to the ears of all the trial-takers and trial officials in the Four Symbols Secret Realm and made their scalps go numb.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is here. What is he doing? Is he insulting the Holy Emperor?”</p><p>“Oh my God, is he crazy? The execution of the Saint at the Yunlun Mountain was not enough to satisfy him. Now, he wants, he wants… You want to kill a Holy Emperor?”</p><p>Some people were shocked by Xu Xiaoshou’s imposing manner.</p><p>Another group of people noticed the matter that was being brought up again.</p><p>“Ghost beast?”</p><p>“Did you hear that? Lord Shou mentioned the ghost beast. What did he mean? Aren’t ghost beasts all bad?”</p><p>“That’s impossible. From the standpoint of the Holy Divine Palace, aren’t all ghost beasts evil? Otherwise, why would they need the red-clothed people?”</p><p>“But this isn’t just Xu Xiaoshou’s idea. Yu Zhiwen from the Holy Divine Palace also said the same thing. What do you make of it?”</p><p>“Uh, then… What is going on?”</p><p>“I don’t know either, but I’m a brainless fish. Anyway, I’m Miss Zhiwen’s dog!”</p><p>The collapsed sky, the shattered space, and the seething sounds of discussion…</p><p>In this dark and noisy world, the figure that held the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff and stepped on the Time Dao Discs was as dazzling as the sun.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen fell among the rocks on the mountain and could not get up.</p><p>Her eyes were filled with confusion as she looked at the familiar figure in the sky and clenched her fists tightly.</p><p>“That’s it!”</p><p>“Those were the words…”</p><p>Sometimes, Yu Zhiwen really hated herself for being dumb.</p><p>If she had Xu Xiaoshou’s gift of the gab, she would be able to express all her unwillingness and resistance in front of the Holy Emperor and the world even if she died.</p><p>It didn’t matter anymore…</p><p>At this moment, Yu Zhiwen looked up at the figure in the sky and felt that the grievances that she had been tormented by had finally been vented.</p><p>Even the fluctuations of her soul had stabilized.</p><p>An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.</p><p>With Xu Xiaoshou’s presence, he would definitely be the best mouth substitute for her!</p><p>However…</p><p>He really came out to face Bei Huai. Did he have something to rely on?</p><p>It couldn’t be something impulsive, right?</p><p>“Kong Yuhen?”</p><p>On the other side of the sky, Bei Huai’s Dao heart was totally unaffected by Xu Xiaoshou’s words.</p><p>History was written by the winners.</p><p>In the face of absolute power, all criticism were only temporary and would be forgotten later.</p><p>How could there not be bloodshed in the Struggle for the Great Path?</p><p>Future generations would judge Bei Huai’s path, but this was not something an ant could touch.</p><p>Bei Huai only looked hesitantly at the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff in Xu Xiaoshou’s hand and the dazzling Power Upanishad Formation.</p><p>“You, are not Kong Yuhen.”</p><p>He stared at Xu Xiaoshou’s face and shook his head slightly. “It’s impossible for Kong Yuhen to cultivate the Time Upanishad, even if it’s an incomplete Upanishad.”</p><p>Bei Huai was curious as to how Xu Xiaoshou was able to escape from the small world so quickly.</p><p>He was also curious about why this person was willing to risk his life even though he could be saved.</p><p>After he said this, Greedy the Cat Spirit leaped back to Xu Xiaoshou’s head.</p><p>Bei Huai did not say anything else. He only loosened the restraints on his power and released a sliver of his Holy Emperor power.</p><p>If he was seeking death, then just do it. There was no need to talk nonsense.</p><p>“Woo…”</p><p>“Wow!”</p><p>In the Four Symbols Secret Realm, everyone’s thoughts were suddenly cut off, and they could no longer form any normal thoughts. Only the sounds of repentance and tears were left as they sank into the ocean of emotions.</p><p>“Forgive me…”</p><p>“I’m sorry…”</p><p>“Sob, sob, sob. I, I shouldn’t have…”</p><p>High up in the sky, Xu Xiaoshou had just picked up Greedy the Cat Spirit when tears and snot flowed out of his eyes.</p><p>It was impossible for him to burst into tears and confess all his secrets in front of the world without any intangible image.</p><p>He immediately used the method of confrontation he used in the shattered world-he switched his consciousness back and forth. He let Jin Ren in the Ran Ming Ruins burst into tears and this allowed him to calmly deal with Bei Huai.</p><p>“Banish!”</p><p>Following the power of time, the Power Upanishad Formation under Xu Xiaoshou’s feet changed into a Space Dao Disc.</p><p>He did not dare to delay any longer.</p><p>If he couldn’t take down a Holy Emperor from the Ten High Nobles in one move, he would definitely be hung up and beaten.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
