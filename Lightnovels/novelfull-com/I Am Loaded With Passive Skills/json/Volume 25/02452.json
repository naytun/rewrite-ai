That stifled giant under the wall was Xu Xiaoshou’s show of weakness to the enemy.</p><p>However, that scene was witnessed by the entire world!</p><p>One person could be wrong, but the memories of a world couldn’t all be fake, right?</p><p>The only thing that could explain all of this was that fleeting thing that seemed to be a Time Power Upanishad Formation.</p><p>Then, again there was the question…</p><p>“Lord Shou has mastered the Time Upanishad?!”</p><p>How many trump cards did this young man have? It was something that the world did not know!</p><p>“+(Suspected. Passive Points+) +9999.”</p><p>“+(Stunned. Passive Points+) +9999.”</p><p>“+(Feared, Passive Points+)+9999.”</p><p>The Information Bar exploded again.</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to be distracted.</p><p>His counterattack was the Heavenly Ancestor Red Scorched Hand, that proved to be very timely. Bei Huai could even use the Five Era Imperial Realm to block it. It was like squeezing out time from a sponge to counterattack.</p><p>If this person were to react after being shocked by the power of time, what method would he use to resist?</p><p>He couldn’t delay!</p><p>He couldn’t afford to take this gamble!</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The Ultimate Giant’s eyes were bloodshot.</p><p>With one strike, the power of the attack caused the defenseless Holy Emperor Qilin’s head to sink into its body.</p><p>“Kaka…”</p><p>The sound of bones exploding resounded endlessly.</p><p>The void shattered like a mirror.</p><p>The entire mountain range where Gong Yang Mountain was located suffered from the aura of the Heavenly Ancestor Red Scorched Hand. The huge rocks that had already been shattered into ruins instantly collapsed and turned into dust.</p><p>The mountain peak sank thousands of feet.</p><p>A palm pressed down, and all lives were reduced to ashes.</p><p>The giant palm print that blasted out from afar was hewn onto Gong Yang Mountain, as it wiped away all traces of life here. Its name would go down in history.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>The so-called spectators who were nearby were no longer alive.</p><p>As for the Cutting Path Stage and the higher void level who had already left the battlefield, they were drenched in cold sweat and secretly thanked their lucky stars.</p><p>When immortals fought, mortals would suffer.</p><p>This battle between the Holy Emperors was not something the higher void level could watch!</p><p>“Boom boom boom…”</p><p>In the midst of the dark spatial fragment.</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin’s body cracked as its flesh and blood spurted out soundlessly from the gaps between the fingers of the Heavenly Ancestor Red Scorched Hand</p><p>It only felt that its head was being held down by someone, and its deep blue eyes were about to pop out from the pressure of that huge hand.</p><p>This ancient Saint beast had never lost to anyone in terms of physical strength.</p><p>But now, due to its weak state, its limbs were shackled and it was held down by one hand and pressed into the flow of debris.</p><p>This was a great humiliation!</p><p>But…</p><p>There were no ifs!</p><p>Weakness was weakness, and bad condition meant bad condition.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was able to master the Human Realm Dao with a glance at the Sovereign Dao Realm and display such combat strength…</p><p>Wasn’t this also the ‘what if’ that no one would consider before the battle?</p><p>Bei Huai did not give too much thought about what would happen if he had made better preparations and and restored the Holy Emperor Qilin to its peak condition before he dealt with Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>After the accident, his soul body surged and he ignited a portion of the Holy Emperor Qilin’s soul body at the fastest speed.</p><p>“Soul sacrifice!”</p><p>He sacrificed a portion of his soul that stimulated his potential and unleashed his peak combat strength!</p><p>“Woo!”</p><p>The spatial fragment was silent.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou felt a shrill cry that came from the Spiritual Universe.</p><p>With that, the Holy Emperor Qilin’s body began to ‘burn’ in a blaze of azure colored cold flames.</p><p>Its aura actually rose steadily, as if it was about to recover to its peak state.</p><p>“Stubborn!”</p><p>“The Heavenly Ancestor’s salvation is a gift. Bei Huai, you still dare to resist?”</p><p>The Ultimate Giant was anxious. How could he give him a chance? How would he dare to give him a chance?</p><p>Almost at the same time when the soul sacrifice began, a dark light flashed in his eyes. His soul reading met with the Holy Emperor Qilin’s protruding eyes.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>In an instant, the Holy Emperor Qilin’s soul body exploded with a loud bang. The soul power that surged out of its body also stagnated.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was surprised.</p><p>Because when he did the Soul Reading, he saw two soul bodies and two wills!</p><p>“That’s right. Bei Huai is only a host. He hasn’t completely erased the Holy Emperor Qilin’s will, so they’re currently in a symbiotic state…”</p><p>“However, there is no doubt that Bei Huai’s will is the master. With a single thought, even if he sacrificed the soul of the Holy Emperor Qilin, the latter will not be able to resist…”</p><p>“They’re both Holy Emperors. Had the Qilin been really willing to do this?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou would never dare to read Bei Huai’s soul, even if it was only a wisp of his soul.</p><p>He was afraid that if he directly faced Bei Huai’s true body, he would really die without a burial place.</p><p>However, the Holy Emperor Qilin…</p><p>He recalled that in the shattered world, the Qilin had clearly seen through his intention to form an alliance and had even tried to persuade him to leave.</p><p>However, he was unrepentant and blindly wanted to lure the Qilin into the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>Little did he know then that this Saint beast had already fallen into Bei Huai’s hands!</p><p>But from its attitude at that time…</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin had been forced!</p><p>Bazhun’an’s idea was good. After a few rounds of mediation, even if the Qilin was controlled by Bei Huai, could they snatch it away?</p><p>Even if he couldn’t snatch it by force, he just needed to persuade it to resist Bei Huai’s will at the critical moment of the battle.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
