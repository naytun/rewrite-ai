If one was suppressed first, he would lose the initiative!</p><p>The Ultimate Giant was too big. This seemed to be its weakness?</p><p>The tree branches and ghostly shadows in the Senluo Realm didn’t even need to aim. They only needed to stab into the center, and pierced into the White Bone Giant.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou wanted to pull himself out, his soul squirmed and struggled. He could not help but tremble a few times.</p><p>“Oh!!”</p><p>The first sound that the White Bone Giant made after the world received a shock was not a frenzied roar, but a moan of extreme pleasure.</p><p>It felt so good!</p><p>It was as if it was in Heaven, bathed in the spring breeze and massaged by countless tender and delicate hands. It was beautiful and indescribable.</p><p>His Spirit Awakening was triggered.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou regained his senses and finally felt that this was actually an endless pain. It was a hidden needle-like pain that pierced his soul.</p><p>“Are these tree branches absorbing my power? Oh…”</p><p>“But why did it feel so good? It’s so good… No, I was hypnotized! These things change painful emotions into comfort, hiss…”</p><p>“Bei Huai can control not only sadness but also this? Wu! Ugh! Woah!!!”</p><p>The power in his body drained away rapidly.</p><p>This was simply adding fuel to the fire of the dispirited state he was in after his sleep.</p><p>Fortunately the Spirit Awakening was the most powerful way to resist the influence of emotions. Xu Xiaoshou would not sink into the sea of emotions and die in comfort.</p><p>He suffered utterly from the combination of ice and fire!</p><p>“I can still be saved…”</p><p>The Ultimate Giant was too massive, and after it transformed, it became too big of a target. There was no way to avoid it, and after being struck by all kinds of branches and ghosts, it was even more difficult to escape.</p><p>The Ultimate Giant was truly too big. It was as big as the Senluo Realm Bei Huai had activated with the Holy Emperor Qilin’s power that could cover almost half of the Qilin world.</p><p>As for the White Bone Giant…</p><p>It was only then that Xu Xiaoshou realized that his Ultimate Giant was bent over after his transformation.</p><p>When it straightened its back and lowered its head to look with its giant eyes, it saw that the dark green barrier wall only reached its chest.</p><p>The White Bone Giant’s chest was pierced through by the tree branches and ghostly shadows, but after it straightened up, its upper chest and head were completely fine!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fell silent.</p><p>Bowing in fear? I think the sky is too low!</p><p>Below, the knee-high Holy Emperor Qilin looked up and realized the shocking truth. The White Bone Giant was too tall! Its height exceeded the limit!</p><p>Even Bei Huai himself was a little stunned.</p><p>A spiritual technique that was activated with the power of a Holy Emperor could overturn the entire Qilin world with a thought, but it could not completely contain Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>How big was this?</p><p>How high was this?</p><p>This kind of ‘accident’ was not considered an accident in normal times, and it was not even considered when one activated a spiritual technique. Was there a need to consider whether the scope of a Territory Skill could hit the enemy?</p><p>Now, such an absurdity had really happened!</p><p>“If Xu Xiaoshou knew some tricks and hid his soul body in his chest…”</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin’s deep blue eyes trembled.</p><p>Bei Huai could sense that the branches and ghostly shadows within the Senluo Realm had stopped moving, and their absorption power had also stopped.</p><p>It was obvious that he wasn’t the only one who thought of a solution. Xu Xiaoshou’s exposed chest and head were also clear-headed.</p><p>“Hahahaha, you didn’t expect this, did you? Bei Huai!”</p><p>In the high sky, a bout of wild laughter suddenly exploded.</p><p>In the next moment, the White Bone Giant’s chest lit up with a scarlet-golden light.</p><p>After all the brilliance gathered on its body, the giant’s chest turned into a dazzling sun.</p><p>No!</p><p>That was…</p><p>“Dragon Pearl?”</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin’s eyes widened.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou realized that the power accumulated in the Dragon Pearl had not been totally drained, he went crazy and did not give Bei Huai any chance.</p><p>He spotted the opportunity and made a countercharge. In an instant, he completely released the undigested power of the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy stored in the Dragon Pearl.</p><p>“Bei Little Qilin, weak Holy Emperor, how dare you look up at God?!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>At the sound of this extremely arrogant voice, the world rumbled and quaked.</p><p>The toy barrier around the White Bone Giant trembled and was about to shatter under the aura of the power of the ancestral source.</p><p>“This is the feeling!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly had a flash of spiritual light. He finally understood why he could not digest the power of the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy for so long.</p><p>This power was meant for the void attendant and the Giant Clan. The human form was so small. How could it be possible to digest it in a short time after he received it?</p><p>However, when he tried to touch this forbidden power in his White Bone Giant form, it was like water that flowed into a canal.</p><p>The power of the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy rapidly merged and became one with his body!</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The White Bone Giant opened its mouth and let out a wild roar. Its voice broke through the clouds and shook the Qilin world.</p><p>“Heavenly Ancestor Legacy, transform!”</p><p>In just a few short breaths, the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy, that might have taken half a month for the human form to fully absorb it after the addition of points, was completely digested.</p><p>The White Bone Giant’s body was covered in patterns of light, and its flesh and blood grew rapidly.</p><p>Not only was the suction force of the tree branches and ghosts that had pierced into its body cut off, but it was also being absorbed in the opposite direction at a single thought from Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“The Heavenly Ancestor Legacy…”</p><p>“He… got it?”</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin’s deep blue eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>Bei Huai watched as the White Bone Giant transformed and evolved. He felt as if he was looking at the resurrection and liberation of the void general on Abyss Island.</p><p>No!</p><p>He might even surpass it!</p><p>As for the characteristics of the void race…</p><p>Bei Huai’s soul body boiled.</p><p>He realized that things seemed to be going south for him.</p><p>Void attendants could ignore energy attacks and even absorb them into their bodies to feed themselves.</p><p>As for Xu Xiaoshou, who had received all the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy…</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin’s thoughts froze and it grunted.</p><p>At this moment, the people in the Qilin world looked around and could not see any of the countless ghosts and tree shadows. They were initially plump and full of juice after they absorbed all the energy, but now they suddenly became emaciated.</p><p>It was as if, in an instant, not only had they returned everything they had absorbed, but even their own original energy had been stolen by others.</p><p>And this thief…</p><p>No! the big thief!</p><p>Countless people raised their eyes and were enlightened.</p><p>The power of the ancestral source from the White Bone Giant perfectly countered Bei Huai’s Holy Emperor spiritual technique, the Senluo Realm.</p><p>“Come!”</p><p>“If you want it, come and fight!”</p><p>The White Bone Giant was the perfect example of what it meant to be unforgiving, arrogant, and unscrupulous.</p><p>It thrust its large hand out, and under the shocked gazes of all the living beings, a Power Upanishad Formation filled with vitality breath appeared under its feet.</p><p>“What type of Power Upanishad Formation is this?” Everyone in the Qilin world were stunned.</p><p>Even Bei Huai’s remnant soul in the Holy Emperor Qilin was shocked by Xu Xiaoshou’s endless Power Upanishad Formations.</p><p>Life Dao Disc!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou told him that this was just one of his Great Dao Disc and it was one that he rarely used.</p><p>He took it out now only to speed up the White Bone Giant’s recovery.</p><p>When he stepped on the Life Dao Disc, he drew in the laws of life, drew in the energy of Heaven and Earth, and entered the state of the Unity of Man and the Heavens.</p><p>There was still the power of the Senluo Realm around him, that had been swallowed by the body of the Heavenly Ancestor to replenish himself.</p><p>When the weather is good and the terrain is favorable, justice is mine!</p><p>With all three of them, it would be difficult to lose.</p><p>Therefore…</p><p>As the White Bone Giant raised its arm, flesh and blood began to grow from its shoulder. It circled around its elbow and turned into its fingertips. Finally, it condensed into the Heavenly Ancestor’s Hand, that was muscular and glowed with magical brilliance.</p><p>This flawless arm that looked like white jade started from the tip of its finger. The Path Principles were charred and withered away. When the black color swam past its elbow and then to its shoulder, its right arm was finally totally charred and withered.</p><p>However, its strength had been elevated to the extreme!</p><p>The power of the ancestral source, the Heavenly Ancestor’s hand!</p><p>Penetrating Divine Senses, Sleeveless -Heavenly Ancestor Red Scorched Hand!</p><p>At this moment, the White Bone Giant stepped on the Upanishad and covered the sky with one hand.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was filled with madness and his heart was higher than the sky. He finally turned into the supreme giant in the fantasy realm. Not only did he have the greatest momentum, but he could even swallow the Holy Emperor!</p><p>In the eyes of the Holy Emperor Qilin, in the eyes of Bei Huai…</p><p>That strike, that arm, it was as if the world had been forcibly suppressed. Along with the fanatic’s clamor, it turned into an infinite brilliance in his pupils.</p><p>“Bei Huai!”</p><p>“Let me Xu Xiaoshou, see how powerful the current Holy Emperor is!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
