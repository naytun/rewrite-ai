Most of it came from the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>To be one of the Ten High Nobles, he was definitely not someone who was incompetent!</p><p>For Bei Huai to become a Holy Emperor at such a young age… Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even dare to make this speculation: was he stronger than Bazhun’an?</p><p>“You’re still deep in thought?”</p><p>Not far away, a faint voice interrupted Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts.</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin was still very apologetic.</p><p>The Berserk Giant who was filled with Jin Ren’s will still cried bitterly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally realized that he should actually take a look at Bei Huai.</p><p>Hence, he followed the voice through his Perception and saw the man who walked over from the shattered world.</p><p>He was tall and looked very young, around 25 or 26 years old. However, when he looked closely, he couldn’t see his face.</p><p>He was dressed in white and was barefooted. There was a faint sadness hidden between his hazy brows. When one looked carefully, it seemed to be an illusion.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t tell anything!</p><p>The only thing he could be sure of was that this was not Bei Huai’s true body. At most, it was a thought incarnation of his Holy Emperor intent.</p><p>“So much so that…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt bitter.</p><p>What Bei Huai said was even more terrifying.</p><p>“I can see that you are able to maintain your calm under my power.”</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang said that you have a very special clone, perhaps more than one… Is it because of that?”</p><p>Bei Huai did not get too close.</p><p>He stopped at a very high position and looked down at the Qilin and the Berserk Giant who hugged each other and cried.</p><p>Intangible raindrops fell onto the shattered world, as if even the Great Path of Heaven and Earth began to cry.</p><p>“None of that is important.”</p><p>“I didn’t come for you.” Bei Huai shook his head and said softly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who remained hidden in the Ran Ming ruins, felt that he had been saved from a dire situation.</p><p>Not for me?</p><p>In other words, there was still hope?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang… That’s right, Elder Dao the Flamboyant was only a demi-saint, how could he prompt a Holy Emperor?</p><p>Bei Huai must have his own motives for his actions!</p><p>“What was it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost changed his will and let the Berserk Giant ask this question, but he resisted the urge and continued to cry meaninglessly.</p><p>Bei Huai’s eyes narrowed slightly, and the world became even more sorrowful. He muttered to himself.</p><p>“I lost a very important test subject.”</p><p>“Because of this, I even wish I could kill my way to the Wu Rao Emperor Realm. However, this is not right because there are still ways to remedy this.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat, and he had a bad feeling.</p><p>Bei Huai continued.</p><p>“I once thought of using the power of a Holy Emperor to crush the Xu Yue Grey Palace and bring over the replacement I wanted.”</p><p>“This won’t do either!”</p><p>“First, a cornered beast will fight back. I don’t want too many chaotic battles.”</p><p>“Secondly, if the Holy Emperor makes a move in the five regions, all lives will be plunged into misery. I can’t bear to see that.”</p><p>“Thirdly, the other four families will definitely not sit by and watch me dominate. If we annex them, they will definitely hinder me in every way.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was even more confused.</p><p>He did not understand what Bei Huai was talking about.</p><p>Could it be that after he became the descendant of the Holy Emperor, he had become too lonely and had learned to talk to himself and spout nonsense like him?</p><p>Bei Huai paused for a moment, then laughed.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang’s path is quite good. It’s very roundabout and tactful. I’ve decided to learn from him and ask him for help.”</p><p>“I’ll start to wait.”</p><p>“I inquired about its whereabouts and heard that it left home and went on a long journey. I didn’t make a move.”</p><p>“In exchange, it accompanied someone else. Its whereabouts has been exposed, so I didn’t make a move.”</p><p>“It appeared in the White Cave, in the Eighth Palace, in Dongtianwang City, in the Yunlun Mountain Range, in Abyss Island… I didn’t make any moves. I endured it for a long time.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s scalp went numb.</p><p>He felt that this ‘it’ referred to him?</p><p>After all, those were the places he had been to along the way!</p><p>Bei Huai looked at the Berserk Giant who was still crying on the Qilin’s body and slowly said.</p><p>“Because Dao Qiongcang told me…”</p><p>“He said that there’s no need to be anxious. When the time is up, it will walk right into the trap.”</p><p>He paused.</p><p>Bei Huai turned around slowly and extended his hand.</p><p>There seemed to be a smile on his blurry face.</p><p>Through his Perception, Xu Xiaoshou saw an additional image on Bei Huai’s hand.</p><p>In the blurry background, where only the shadow of the Stairway to Heaven could be seen, Dao Qiongcang smiled at a man in white and said.</p><p>“It’s time.”</p><p>Without a doubt, the white-robed man was the barefooted Bei Huai.</p><p>Without a doubt, the ‘time’ that Dao Qiongcang mentioned was ‘now’!</p><p>Bei Huai waved his sleeve and the image in front of him disappeared. He praised sincerely.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang is indeed powerful.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
