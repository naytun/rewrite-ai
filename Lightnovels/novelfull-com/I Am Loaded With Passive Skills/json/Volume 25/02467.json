From the Sovereign Dao Realm, she rose to the Cutting Path and higher void level.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>She pointed.</p><p>The dark color of the black-and-white Reborn Lily that bloomed into the sky beneath her feet swallowed all the purity and turned into pure scarlet blood.</p><p>With a boom, the blood-red Reborn Lily, the Weeping Blood Shahua took off on a Heavenly Slaughter.</p><p>Along the way, it flew at a high speed like the God Devil Eyes and even choked and obliterated the ancient evil tree and swallowed it as nutrients for itself.</p><p>The destructive Holy Emperor’s light descended from the Three-day Soul Shifting array.</p><p>Bei Huai’s will had clearly gone crazy from killing and he had even thrown the mission to the back of his mind. He only wanted to get rid of the person who obstructed him before he shifted his soul body.</p><p>This was related to his memory loss after he became a remnant soul, as well as his own will and the small manic problem he had.</p><p>“Long.”</p><p>In just one exchange, the sky cracked and Yin and Yang were destroyed.</p><p>The destructive light struck the blood-red Reborn Lily and caused it to slow down.</p><p>In the next breath.</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er, who still held on, couldn’t hold it in anymore and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>After all, she was only at the Sovereign Dao Realm. Even though the God Devil Eyes had the power to penetrate Heaven and Earth, its Diabolical Force nature had only temporarily raised her power to the higher void level.</p><p>The higher void level faced the Holy Emperor who was the weakest remnant soul of a Holy Emperor and had no power to parry.</p><p>The Weeping Blood Shahua was able to resist for an instant. This had already exceeded Lei Xi’er’s expectations. It was all thanks to the power of the God Devil Eyes and the power of the ancestral source.</p><p>“Ultimate Demon Realm!”</p><p>Time was tight. Lei Xi’er didn’t even have time to wipe away the blood on her lips. After her delicate body trembled, she immediately chose to release the Ultimate Life Demon Physique.</p><p>This Ultimate Life Demon Physique that was once listed as one of the Five Extreme Physiques, once again appeared in the eyes of the world.</p><p>Vitality spiritual energy filled the sky.</p><p>What followed closely behind was a monstrous devilish energy that could pollute and swallow the creatures that had this vitality spiritual energy.</p><p>The black devilish energy spread out and covered tens of thousands of miles, and plundered all the vitality in the surroundings.</p><p>“Ohh!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er couldn’t help but groan, and her pale oval face became even more flushed.</p><p>She was almost intoxicated by this overwhelming vitality spiritual energy and turned into Mu Zixi!</p><p>However, she quickly regained her senses and poured the power she had obtained from the Ultimate Life Demon Physique into the Weeping Blood Shahua.</p><p>“Boom boom boom…”</p><p>Under the Holy Emperor’s destructive light, the Weeping Blood Shahua was about to stop spinning and fall apart.</p><p>Suddenly, there was a tremor.</p><p>The rotation speed had increased, and she could actually hold on for a few more breaths!</p><p>“One breath, three breaths?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s delicate body trembled violently, and her expression hardened.</p><p>Even the Ultimate Demon realm could not withstand such a consumption. She even began to draw out the power of the White Cave Small World. She was really that desperate!</p><p>However, there were still parts of her body that began to rupture due to the backlash, and blood flowed out-it was unbearable.</p><p>Lei Xi’er didn’t know how long she could last.</p><p>She only knew that as long as her eyes stayed open, the Weeping Blood Shahua would not stop spinning.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>At the same time, Lei Xi’er knew that she only needed to do this.</p><p>She also knew that what Xu Xiaoshou really needed was not the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff, but the time it could bring.</p><p>At this point…</p><p>Humans could do it too.</p><p>At the same time, she could also bear the consumption for him.</p><p>Behind him, the destructive light and the Weeping Blood Shahua collided.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was immersed in the ancient Way of the Sword. What he stepped on had already become a Way of the Sword Disc.</p><p>He could not make any moves.</p><p>But he had to make a move!</p><p>Since that was the case, he could only choose something that would not consume much energy even if he used it, or something that could be used to replace the consumption.</p><p>It just so happened…</p><p>There was! I just learned it!</p><p>Lei Xi’er had replaced the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff, so Xu Xiaoshou was free to try the Hungry Ghost Path.</p><p>This was the only way he could use the Soul Holy Medicine to make up for his consumption.</p><p>He didn’t need to break the Three-day Soul Shifting.</p><p>After all, that was a strike that had stolen the power of Bei Huai’s peak Holy Emperor thought incarnation after the Soul Sacrifice. No matter how confident Xu Xiaoshou was, he was not confident enough to break this move.</p><p>However, he only needed to enter the Hungry Ghost Path and turn into a Hungry Ghost. He would then crush Bei Huai’s remnant soul and remnant thought.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
