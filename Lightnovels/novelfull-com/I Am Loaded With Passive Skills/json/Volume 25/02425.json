Otherwise, if I had hit him just now, I could have shattered his entire soul body with one punch.”</p><p>After a click of his tongue, The Divine clenched his fist, his words tinged with a sense of lingering satisfaction:</p><p>“On that note, it’s quite a rare experience. During the War of the Ten High Nobles, I beat up everyone but solely missed this guy.”</p><p>Glancing at the crumbling golden throne beneath his feet, Xu Xiaoshou shrank his neck.</p><p>Alright.</p><p>This was the real boss!</p><p>In response to The Divine’s words, Xu Xiaoshou looked up towards the horizon.</p><p>The huge soul body of Bei Huai was completely displaced, his head turned towards his back.</p><p>His soul body shattered completely, and dark blue blood oozed from the numerous wounds, not dripping but gradually being reabsorbed.</p><p>He was embedded in the barrier of the Soul Capturing Realm that he himself had opened on the Four Symbols Secret Realm, but his eyes were fixed firmly downward.</p><p>Or rather…</p><p>Throughout, his gaze was fixed solely on Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“Locked-on, passive points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath, concealing his shock.</p><p>Taking a punch of such intensity, Bei Huai wasn’t dead yet!</p><p>If it were someone else, the reincarnation passage would have been blasted to smithereens by The Divine!</p><p>Was this the strength of a divine soul of a Holy Emperor’s thought incarnation? And this was just a mere incarnation!</p><p>But after a glance at The Divine, Xu Xiaoshou felt relieved.</p><p>Bei Huai was indeed just a thought incarnation of a Holy Emperor, but wasn’t The Divine just a mere virtual image?</p><p>The Ten High Nobles were truly unparalleled!</p><p>“Is there any way to maintain the Hungry Ghost Path in this state?” Xu Xiaoshou asked eagerly.</p><p>“There is.”</p><p>“What way?”</p><p>“But it’s costly.”</p><p>Costly?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was momentarily stunned. What kind of method was this?</p><p>“The ‘Hungry Ghost Path’ among the Six Paths can reverse spirit flesh, turning all my output and damage into a divine soul state.”</p><p>“But before opening it, I need to swallow a large number of spirit medicines to enhance my divine soul, preferably Holy Medicine, otherwise it will devour my own divine soul and enhance my strength.”</p><p>“Just now, I only threw a punch, consuming the equivalent of a hundred years of a Higher Void Family’s foundation.”</p><p>“But since Xiang’er isn’t here, I didn’t take the Holy Medicine, so I can only throw one punch; otherwise, it would damage my foundation…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
