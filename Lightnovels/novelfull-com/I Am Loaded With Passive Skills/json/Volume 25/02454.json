The Path Principles rolled about and withered.</p><p>Sleeveless, Heavenly Ancestor Red Scorched Hand!</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>At the same time, the knee-high Holy Emperor Qilin shot out of the spatial fragment.</p><p>The divine light on its horn condensed again as it borrowed the power of the soul sacrifice to attack again.</p><p>“Block it for me…”</p><p>The Ultimate Giant cried out in sorrow. It seemed to be in despair, but there was nothing it could do. It could only block.</p><p>There was no time to dodge!</p><p>The pair of Heavenly Ancestor Red Scorched Hands braced themselves against the horn filled with divine light.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t just sit there and wait for his death.</p><p>Acalanātha!</p><p>Open!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Qilin’s second divine light borrowed the power of the soul sacrifice and temporarily gained the power of a high level Holy Emperor. It should have easily passed through the Ultimate Giant’s block.</p><p>Suddenly, when it touched the faint golden light on the Ultimate Giant’s body, it paused for a moment.</p><p>Just for an instant!</p><p>“Bang bang bang…”</p><p>The divine light penetrated its body, and the Ultimate Giant took three steps back again.</p><p>As for the Holy Emperor Qilin, its body exploded and its Qilin blood splattered all over the Qilin world.</p><p>Its huge body was like a rubber ball, and it was sent flying backward by the rebound force.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>“How was this possible?”</p><p>Bei Huai’s remnant thought was momentarily stunned by the explosion.</p><p>He couldn’t tell what kind of defensive spiritual technique this was!</p><p>During the exchange, there wasn’t any ‘powerful’ aura that made him stop on a whim.</p><p>However, its strength…</p><p>This could not be called a spiritual technique or even a Holy Emperor spiritual technique. This was a divine skill!</p><p>“Why…”</p><p>“Why was it that even though I was able to break through the giant’s defense with one strike, I still suffered the same backlash as the attack of the black yellow divine light?”</p><p>In Bei Huai’s plan, the two beams of divine light were enough to break the Ultimate Giant’s defenses.</p><p>Even if it had the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy!</p><p>Even though it still had the red Taotie Beast Head, it could devour energy attacks!</p><p>However, the strength of the divine light was too condensed. The Heavenly Ancestor Legacy and the Taotie Beast Head could not be absorbed in one breath. He could only take it head-on.</p><p>Next, the Ultimate Giant that was bound to be heavily injured could be easily taken down as long as he took advantage of the situation.</p><p>Bei Huai was not Xu Xiaoshou. He would not be so naive as to step on the mines laid by the enemy.</p><p>He could take advantage of his weakness and grind the Ultimate Giant into dregs, bit by bit.</p><p>However, the force of the Recoil and the golden light had put paid to all of Bei Huai’s fantasies!</p><p>The Ultimate Giant could withstand two divine light attacks and did not die because it had a fully formed passive skill.</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin was already in a bad state, and the soul sacrifice was only meant to explode.</p><p>At this point, in its weak state and after it suffered from the backlash of the divine light, how could it still have the strength to fight?</p><p>“Hahahaha…”</p><p>The Ultimate Giant laughed maniacally, and the sense of powerlessness it felt earlier was gone. Its laughter did not hide its mockery at all.</p><p>“Stupid Bei Huai, you’ve been tricked!”</p><p>“To have ambushed me so viciously and made me suffer a painful counterattack, I have to admit that you were really sinister!”</p><p>“But you were too greedy!”</p><p>The Ultimate Giant was already exhausted, and its condition had hit rock bottom.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou even wanted to turn off his Moment of Enlightenment, but he was afraid that he would lose his mind if he turned it off.</p><p>The battle had dragged on for too long. He could no longer withstand such consumption. His eyelids drooped and he felt sleepy.</p><p>He was still able to hold on, all in one breath, all because of his reluctant thoughts, all because of the Human Realm Dao that absorbed the world’s energy to make up for his own losses.</p><p>Even so, it was still not enough.</p><p>If he hadn’t learned the Divine’s ancient martial arts technique, the Six Paths, he would have fallen long ago.</p><p>However, he did not dare to let Bei Huai see any signs of this. He was afraid that he would be overturned!</p><p>He even tried his best to squeeze out the last trace of the Heavenly Ancestor’s Power stored in the Dragon Pearl and ignite his own potential just to stay awake!</p><p>He stretched out his gigantic hand…</p><p>As he maintained his mocking attitude, he mobilized his pair of extremely heavy hands that felt like they were no longer his and thrust them forward.</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin was sent flying like a rubber ball. It was like the monkey that could never fly out of Buddha’s palm. It could not fly out of the Ultimate Giant’s range for a long time.</p><p>When the Ultimate Giant pressed its palms together, the Holy Emperor Qilin was like a mosquito. With a snap, it was caught in its palm.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>Splat… Blood splattered all around.</p><p>The Qilin was filled with juice. This time, it was really about to burst with all that juice!</p><p>Its cracked body was completely out of control. After the soul sacrifice, it became even weaker.</p><p>When the Ultimate Giant put its palms together, all the people in the Qilin world heard the sound of Bei Huai’s ‘juice’ exploding.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>As for Bei Huai’s remnant soul, he was still unable to recover from the backlash of the divine light after three breaths.</p><p>At this moment, under The Divine’s attack, he had also severed his tail in order to survive. The flaw of having only a remnant soul to host the Qilin was undoubtedly revealed!</p><p>The remaining remnant soul power was not enough to rouse him up in time from such heavy injuries.</p><p>“Why bother?”</p><p>“I’ve already said it. Why force me to make a move?”</p><p>The Ultimate Giant crushed the Holy Emperor Qilin with both hands and sighed in disdain.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
