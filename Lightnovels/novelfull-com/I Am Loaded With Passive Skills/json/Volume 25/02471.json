Say something, and I’ll answer you. There’s no charge, and you don’t need to join our Divine Sect…”</p><p>The Divine Sorcerer looked at the backs of the two people as they left, and his eyes were filled with resentment.</p><p>The commotion that took place quickly attracted the attention of the passers-by nearby. One by one, they looked back and recalled something after they compared memories.</p><p>“F*ck, a Storyteller, and such a high-quality imitation.”</p><p>“F*ck! Bazhun’an! He had a certain depressed manner about him. When you think about it… It looks like him!”</p><p>The fatigued Divine Sorcerer who was still preaching was unwilling to give up. He shouted at the backs of the two people,</p><p>“Don’t say that. You can talk about something else. I’m very liberal as long as it’s cool.”</p><p>Bazhun’an did not stop and left calmly.</p><p>“Shh!” A bearded man on the street whistled at the Storyteller and raised his eyebrows.</p><p>The Storyteller’s expression turned ugly.</p><p>Bazhun’an remained unmoved.</p><p>“Come on, Brother Bazhun’an, that one…”</p><p>“Be wary of external temptations, Bazhun’an… Hurry up, I want to hear the next sentence!”</p><p>The Storyteller was about to kill someone.</p><p>Bazhun’an was still calm, but he didn’t say anything else. He smiled as they turned at the corner of the street.</p><p>“Tsk, boring.”</p><p>“It’s not fun at all. What’s the point of all this?”</p><p>“Ah, I’m so unhappy. I feel really uncomfortable. Will I die if I rebut them? D*mn it, I really want to kill them…”</p><p>“Higher void level.”</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>The Divine Sorcerer who stood by the side of the road saw that a group of people had surrounded the Ba-Story duo, but nothing happened. In the end, they parted unhappily and he could not help but smile.</p><p>The Southern Region was like this.</p><p>It was said that each of them was involved in a murder case and dared to draw their swords at the slightest provocation. In fact, everyone cherished their lives more than anything else. Otherwise, why would they run to Half-Moon Bay to take refuge?</p><p>If it was something that could be solved with their mouths, these people would rather lose half their lives than fight.</p><p>Of course, it was a different story if the difference in realms was too great.</p><p>“Nangong’s technique!”</p><p>The missionary team obviously realized that there were fewer people, and suddenly a shout came from afar.</p><p>“He’s here…”</p><p>The Divine Sorcerer replied. He glanced at the Ba-Story duo that had disappeared from the nameless street, and some ancient characters flickered dimly in front of him.</p><p>He bent down and picked up the crumpled flyer. When he smoothed it, he could still see a few straggly characters.</p><p>“Control the divine and naturalize ten thousand laws.”</p><p>“Forgive sins and change your fate. The divine seals gods.”</p><p>On it, there was still the saliva of the high-end imitation Storyteller.</p><p>“It’s too tiring.”</p><p>“It’s simply not a job for humans.”</p><p>He stuffed the crumpled flyer into his pocket and tucked it away. The Divine Sorcerer grabbed a brand new flyer and shouted as he ran.</p><p>“Take a look. Only three Spirit Crystals to join the Divine Sect!”</p><p>“Learn the Divine Secret and attain eternal life. A Divine Secret can be mastered in three months. Are your family members really not tempted at all?”</p><p>“+(Feared, Passive Points+)+9999.”</p><p>“+(Stunned. Passive Points),+9999.”</p><p>“Received…”</p><p>The battlefield came to a standstill.</p><p>However, the pop-up window on the Information Bar did not stop.</p><p>The battle that attracted the attention of the world could be considered to have ended.</p><p>“Ha…”</p><p>The Ultimate Giant exhaled a mouthful of steam into the clouds. Its eyes lost all their luster, and its back began to sag.</p><p>It had opened its jaw to swallow the Soul Holy Medicine, but now it had no strength to close it.</p><p>After it destroyed all of Bei Huai’s little movements with a single punch and shattered the possibility of any resurrection and parasitism, Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts became clear and he felt a sense of final-stage perfection.</p><p>Spiritual Source, Way of the Sword, Ancient Martial Arts, Soul Body…</p><p>After this battle, all kinds of Great Paths stepped into that door.</p><p>It was not the peak of perfection, but some of the flaws that had existed earlier that had been easily exploited, used and targeted by the enemy, had all been fixed.</p><p>As long as the Holy Emperor didn’t come again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was confident that he could kill any demi-saint with a corresponding or restraining ability!</p><p>“Weng…”</p><p>His energy reserve fluctuated.</p><p>There was clearly not even a drop of spiritual source left, but it still gave people a faint sense of impact like that of a mountain flash flood and tsunami.</p><p>His energy reserve rose.</p><p>Although there was no tide, but…</p><p>“I can break through now!”</p><p>His spiritual source was no longer the shackle that restricted Xu Xiaoshou from breaking through from the Dao Realm to the Cutting Path Stage.</p><p>After his Breathing Technique reached the Holy Emperor Lv.0, he released his control a few more times to absorb more spiritual energy.</p><p>With the cooperation of his transformation, his Sovereign Dao Realm had reached its final-stage perfection.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou could clearly feel that he could sever his Cutting Path Stage with just a thought.</p><p>However, such a Cutting Path Stage was definitely not perfect.</p><p>The Sovereign Dao Realm was a process of polishing the foundation of the Great Path.</p><p>For example, Yu Lingdi, Ye Xiaotian, Water Ghost and so on…</p><p>Who didn’t stay in this first realm for several years, or even decades, before they finally broke through and advanced by leaps and bounds?</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>The saint calamity was still ongoing.</p><p>He could no longer see what took place in his surroundings.</p><p>However, he could see that Ye Xiaotian still underwent his transcend the tribulation through his Perception.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou remembered that if he was not wrong, Master Dean was such a typical example!</p><p>He had been stuck in his Upanishad for most of his life. After he had perfected his final-stage Upanishad, he had gone through the Cutting Path Stage, the Nine Death Thunder Calamity, the higher void level, the demi-saint…</p><p>In just one or two months, he had completed the lot.</p><p>“This is a true genius.”</p><p>Unlike other Spiritual Cultivators, Xu Xiaoshou’s Upanishad could be cultivated with the Profound Dao Seed.</p><p>This meant that he didn’t need much time to cultivate. He could see the progress bar to know how far he was from the Power Upanishad.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
