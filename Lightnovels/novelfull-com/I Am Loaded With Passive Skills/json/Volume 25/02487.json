If placed on the Shengshen Continent, it could attract the higher void to fight for it and the demi-saints to attack, creating a bloody disaster.</p><p>In this space, it did not look as noble as the third-grade elixirs that were flying out of the alchemy cauldron.</p><p>“All of them.”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man knew he had seen Xu Xiaoshou’s secret world.</p><p>It was the power of the Blood World Pearl. The projected images could ignore the barriers of various powers of the world.</p><p>However, Five Decays of Heaven and Man knew this wasn’t the entire picture. Blood World Pearl must have concealed it.</p><p>As expected, when the image enlarged…</p><p>Above the Dragon Apricot Tree, one of the Nine Great Ancestral Trees, the spirit of the Dragon Apricot Tree shone with dazzling golden light, and its serpentine form glared angrily, extending its gaze beyond the boundary, seeking out those who dared to spy.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man took half a step back in fright.</p><p>However, even the ancestral tree, the Dragon Apricot, could not hurt him through the projection of the Blood World Pearl.</p><p>On the other hand, the Blood World Pearl even thoughtfully spat out a ray of light and fed Five Decays of Heaven and Man again attempting to comfort the frightened heart.</p><p>It seemed a tremendously friendly gesture, probably because it wanted a second sumptuous meal, like the one at the Hundred Shattered Beast Mountain.</p><p>“I won’t touch his things.”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man said in a deep voice, knowing it should be Rao Yaoyao’s demi-saint person, and he didn’t want to get involved in karma.</p><p>“Change to another…”</p><p>After a pause, Five Decays of Heaven and Man thought of the unconscious Xu Xiaoshou in the scene just now.</p><p>“Is there any way to contact him?”</p><p>Blood World Pearl buzzed and just like previously, it spat out a twig.</p><p>This twig was not a projection but a real existence.</p><p>It wasn’t the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch either but of the same color as the ancestral tree’s Dragon Apricot, golden yellow.</p><p>“Dragon Apricot’s twig?”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man took the golden twig without spirituality and pondered for a moment.</p><p>There was a high chance that he could not contact Xu Xiaoshou directly.</p><p>However, he could contact Dragon Apricot. Dragon Apricot was the ancestral tree, and Seven Trees Emperor was the blood tree, which was also the ancestral tree.</p><p>The ancestral trees should have the ability to communicate with each other.</p><p>In other words…</p><p>It would be useless if someone else took this Dragon Apricot twig.</p><p>However, in his hands, he could communicate with the Seven Trees Emperor through the Blood World Pearl, then communicate with the spirit of the Dragon Apricot Spirit, and then use it to summon Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“The opportunities of other demi-saint persons.”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man put away the Dragon Apricot twig and returned to the main topic.</p><p>The Blood World Pearl was obviously unhappy. After all, he had given him two chances, and the second was within his grasp. He only needed to ask once.</p><p>However, since its ability was limited, it projected another image.</p><p>This time, the image showed a prosperous city…</p><p>“Jade Capital City?”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s eye expression turned cold. He subconsciously thought that the Blood World Pearl was toying with him again.</p><p>Not to mention that he now had the Blood World Pearl, just that he had a Body of Decay made him unwilling to go to such a bustling place.</p><p>If he wasn’t careful, the entire Jade Capital City would turn into the Golden Technique Sect, and blood would flow like a river. Then, his sin would be grave!</p><p>Lone Star of the Heavenly Calamity was no joke.</p><p>Even Lei Xi’er…</p><p>If he did not know Lei Xi’er had the Power of Divinity to resist the influence, Five Decays of Heaven and Man would not have invited her to leave Xu Xiaoshou and travel with him.</p><p>After all, even Huang Quan was afraid of him.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man was used to being alone.</p><p>But soon, as the scene appeared, Five Decays of Heaven realized he had misunderstood.</p><p>A woman of average look, height, and figure was presented in Blood World Pearl’s projection this time.</p><p>At the same time, another small image appeared at the bottom of the screen.</p><p>The woman slapped the ground and summoned a bald man from the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man didn’t know the woman.</p><p>But he had seen the bald man in a battle just now. He was the Divine with valiant combat strength.</p><p>And the Divine person who could summon the Ten High Nobles…</p><p>“Xiang Yaoyao?”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man looked forward to the scene Blood World Pearl projected this time.</p><p>It made sense that Xiang Yaoyao the Ten High Nobles had a semi-saint person. Moreover, she was very weak…</p><p>Even if he could summon the Divine and not fight but exchange, it would be an opportunity.</p><p>Subconsciously, Five Decays of Heaven and Man wanted to follow his heart and head to the Jade Capital City to find this person.</p><p>However, he quickly came back to his senses and said, “All of them.”</p><p>The image zoomed in.</p><p>Aunt Xiang actually couldn’t move!</p><p>In front of her, hundreds of white-clothed people were forming an array, waiting solemnly.</p><p>On the ground were more than ten burly figures in black. Their acupuncture points were shining, but they were on the verge of death.</p><p>There were also dozens of people wearing white plain clothes and broken masks. From their auras, one could easily tell they were death warriors nurtured by some large families and factions.</p><p>Yes, they were all dead!</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man frowned, and his gaze fell on the person in front of the familiar white-clothed people formation.</p><p>This should be a person.</p><p>This person’s face was blurry and even his body could not be seen clearly. Even the corners of his clothes swayed in the wind and were pulled out by the wind.</p><p>“Who is this?”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man couldn’t help but ask.</p><p>He was a demi-saint with three extreme physiques and held the Blood World Pearl. He had also just signed an agreement with Seven Trees Emperor, so he could see the spirit of the Apricot Dragon without being noticed.</p><p>Not many people in the world Five Decays of Heaven and Man feared unless they were Holy Emperors with extremely strong senses.</p><p>But why would the Holy Emperor personally enter the scene to capture the only trash of the Ten High Nobles?</p><p>This person was at most a demi-saint!</p><p>What was the Blood World Pearl trying to do by hiding it? Could it be that the semi-saint person was actually in this person?</p><p>“Enlarge it,” said Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>Blood World Pearl was still spinning after receiving the order.</p><p>This time, it didn’t act in time, as if it had rejected the suggestion. It didn’t enlarge the completely blurry figure.</p><p>“I said, don’t play tricks. Project it clearly!</p><p>“I will not go over if I don’t know who this person is. You should know that I value my life very much.”</p><p>Blood World Pearl stopped spinning.</p><p>The shadow moving with the wind on the projection faded bit by bit.</p><p>For no reason, Five Decays of Heaven and Man was anxious.</p><p>However, this was not a direct call of the Saint’s name. He was only watching through the projection of the Blood World Pearl. Even the ancestral tree, Dragon Aprocot could not find him just now…</p><p>When he realized that this was Blood World Pearl’s doing again, wanting to play tricks, Five Decays of Heaven and Man stopped the thought of not looking and escaping, and focused his gaze.</p><p>In the picture, a star-patterned white robe, a jade belt, a divine Sinan, and the perfect profile of a middle-aged man appeared.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man was stunned for a moment. He felt that he had seen an important detail and missed it again.</p><p>Soon, his eyes focused on the item in the middle-aged man’s hand.</p><p>“Divine Sinan?”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man exclaimed.</p><p>At the same time, the middle-aged man in the image seemed to have sensed something and turned his head.</p><p>The corners of his lips curled up slightly, and his eyes were filled with surprise. His voice was extremely clear as it came from the supposedly silent image.</p><p>“Yo, new friend?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
