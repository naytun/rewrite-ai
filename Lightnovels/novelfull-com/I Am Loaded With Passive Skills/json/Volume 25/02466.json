He planned to use a preemptive technique in the future and hoped to turn the tables again.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou also knew.</p><p>This time, after he used the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff, he would lose more than half of his life.</p><p>“Bazhun’an…”</p><p>“This… this is still not extreme enough…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not have the strength to complain.</p><p>He had decided that he would not let that Eighth Brother off even if he became a ghost. He wanted to pull off the guy’s other eight fingers even if he had to come back to life.</p><p>At this moment, an incongruous message popped up on the Information Bar.</p><p>“+(Cursed, Passive Points+)+1,+1,+1,+1…)</p><p>This information was mixed in with the various ‘+9999’ with remarks such as ‘being watched’, ‘being respected’, etc. It was quite dazzling.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t have time to think about what this meant.</p><p>A cold albeit charming voice sounded in his ears.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I’m here.”</p><p>After that, there was a clear voice filled with anger and hatred.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, do you want to die? Can’t you run? Aren’t you the best at the Stealth Technique?”</p><p>“How dare you battle him on your own? You have fallen. Now, you are actually relying on your junior sister to save you…”</p><p>“You’re too stupid!!!”</p><p>Under the Three Heavens, the world destroying power.</p><p>The people who were prostrated in the world below raised their heads and were shocked to see a black figure in the void.</p><p>The wind howled about as her exquisite figure was outlined.</p><p>Under her fluttering silver hair, when one looked back, he would be stunned by the black and white colors of the God Devil.</p><p>“Sizzle! Sizzle!”</p><p>White mist surged out of Lei Xi’er’s left eye and formed a pair of spiritual guardian hands that blocked the pressure of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>The devilish energy in her right eye raged and condensed into dark ancient demonic trees, that poured madly into the teleportation portal in the sky. They were twisted and torn by the force.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators in the world below were completely dumbfounded.</p><p>From their perspective, this black-robed silver-haired woman had suddenly appeared and forcefully intervened between the Three-day Soul Shifting array and the Ultimate Giant.</p><p>Just when everyone was still surprised that this woman seemed to have a death wish, a black and white Reborn Lily suddenly bloomed under her feet.</p><p>Half of it was a divine holiness, forged with the protection of the guardian hands.</p><p>The other half was demonic evil, twisted and formed from evil ancient trees.</p><p>“Who is this?”</p><p>“No, it can’t be! How is this possible? The aura on her body was clearly only… at the Sovereign Stage?”</p><p>“The Power of Divinity, Diabolical Force. Oh my God, what did I just see? This dual-colored Reborn Lily, this pair of eyes, this, this is…”</p><p>Some people were shocked by how weak this woman’s cultivation was. She actually dared to appear in the battle alone.</p><p>Some people were shocked by how powerful the Reborn Lily was. It was clearly the legendary power of the ancestral source that allowed it to resist the pressure of a Holy Emperor.</p><p>Some of the elders from the Central Region suddenly had tears in their eyes, but they only dared to mutter to themselves.</p><p>“Brother Lei, your descendant has appeared…”</p><p>“Little Junior Sister!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>He never thought that Bazhun’an’s strongest helper would be Lei Xi’er!</p><p>“No way…”</p><p>He subconsciously wanted to stop her.</p><p>After all, even if Bei Huai only had a sliver of his will left, it was not something that ordinary people could deal with.</p><p>Didn’t void general Hong almost lose his life and nearly had his soul scattered.</p><p>But…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly reacted.</p><p>Lei Xi’er was not an ordinary person!</p><p>In terms of extraordinariness, this woman was even above him.</p><p>He still needed to experience Abyss Island and empty the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer and gain various blessings before he could obtain the power of the Heavenly Ancestor and the power of the Dragon Ancestor.</p><p>Lei Xier’s God Devil Eyes contained two of the power of the ancestral source.</p><p>It was also the most extreme and most opposing Diabolical Force and she was compatible with it.</p><p>The Ultimate Giant’s eyes immediately lit up, and he put away the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff with a flip of his hand. He could no longer use this thing that consumed so much energy.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had total trust in his little junior sister.</p><p>It was just like how this girl chose to enter the battlefield without a word and chose to fight with her life on the line.</p><p>There were no reminders from each other.</p><p>It didn’t matter who the cooperation came from.</p><p>Under the Three-day Soul Shifting, Lei Xi’er’s voice and the Ultimate Giant’s voice overlapped.</p><p>God Devil Sacrifice.</p><p>Renowned swordsmanship.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
