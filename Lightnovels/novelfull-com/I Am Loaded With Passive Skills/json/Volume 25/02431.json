Even if he did, he would only be shocked. After the shock, he would probably ask, “What should we do then?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chose to skip the process and asked him instead. “Do you know the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon?”</p><p>“I do.”</p><p>“If its true body descended, but there are restrictions, its strength… is less than ten percent, but it’s a true body. Can you fight it?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>When he heard this answer, Xu Xiaoshou was overjoyed.</p><p>In the next second, The Divine seemed to have realized something and said, “I’m talking about my main body, but if you’re referring to my virtual image… then I can’t.”</p><p>F*ck!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost slapped the bald man who had split his words in half.</p><p>The Divine paused for a moment. “When I say I can’t, I mean I can’t defeat it. But I should be able to cause some injuries and both sides will suffer. That will buy you some time to escape.”</p><p>You f*cking split your statement into three parts!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was furious. After The Divine passed by, he said seriously, “The premise is that you still have the medicine. As for the one that corresponded to the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, it’s not a Soul Holy Medicine. It’s…”</p><p>You still split up your statement into so many segments?</p><p>Why doesn’t your butt have so many segments too?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath and felt the Holy Emperor power around him gradually become denser. He asked again.</p><p>“If Bei Huai’s will and the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon merge perfectly, it will have the strength of the soul body and an absolute physical body…”</p><p>Before he could finish, The Divine suddenly looked around.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>“In this direction.” The Divine pointed into the distance.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“Run! Don’t turn back!”</p><p>“As long as you enter the Cross Corner Street, I will definitely…”</p><p>“Uh, use the Force of Rules of the City of the Dead Bodhisattva to stall for time. When I leave the Ran Ming ruins, I’ll definitely protect you!”</p><p>You’re not even at the Cross Corner Street!</p><p>You even entered the Ran Ming ruins?</p><p>Is there something wrong with you? Why did you enter the Ran Ming ruins when it was so far away?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was about to explode.</p><p>How did this thing survive until now… Oh, this was a virtual image. His main body was indeed fearless, so it was fine.</p><p>“Don’t be angry, don’t be angry…”</p><p>“If you get sick from anger, there will be no one to take care of you…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lowered his head and looked at the Information Bar.</p><p>“+(Locked-on, Passive points+)+1.”</p><p>The world was in turmoil, and everything started to flee.</p><p>He glanced at The Divine, who would take the lead if the sky collapsed. This guy said ‘run’ very smoothly, and there was no fear in his expression.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have been affected. He calmed down and his heart was equally calm.</p><p>“I am no longer me.”</p><p>“So what if I’m being locked on?”</p><p>“I’ve saved Greedy the Cat Spirit. The most difficult part is over. If it doesn’t work out, I’ll send it back to the Apricot Realm or sign a contract with it directly.”</p><p>“As long as I have the Independence, turn it on and off at times, and keep my soul body from fluctuating…”</p><p>“If Bei Huai wants to find me or the Apricot Realm, it will be as difficult as the ascension to the Heavens.”</p><p>“What am I afraid of?”</p><p>In the sky, Xu Xiaoshou laughed out loud.</p><p>He realized that his mentality had been affected by his past habit of inertia. His first reaction was to escape whenever he was in a dilemma.</p><p>But now, he was already very strong.</p><p>Even if it was difficult to be ranked first in terms of direct combat strength, his ability to escape was second to none in the continent.</p><p>This time, if he hadn’t encountered his weakness, he would have fought against Bei Huai’s soul body.</p><p>If it was a Holy Emperor, he might really be able to teach him a lesson!</p><p>“There’s not much power left in Bei Huai’s soul body…”</p><p>“Even if he can control the holy land’s Qilin, its strength would not be much stronger due to the restrictions of the Four Symbols Secret Realm…”</p><p>“Even The Divine can’t defeat the combination of these two, but it’s also because his virtual image’s combat strength isn’t strong. I’m different!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought about it carefully and realized that he had overlooked a crucial issue…</p><p>“I’m in my peak condition, completely unharmed!”</p><p>If he could solve the problem of being unable to deal with the soul body’s attack…</p><p>Even if the Ultimate Giant couldn’t defeat the Holy Emperor Qilin, it could at least give that d*mned Bei Huai a little shock, right?</p><p>Moreover, if he could make up for his shortcomings today, he would have nothing to fear even if Bei Huai’s true body came one day.</p><p>And to make up for this shortcoming…</p><p>Before he summoned The Divine, Xu Xiaoshou did not even think about it. He was not even sure if The Divine could defeat the Holy Emperor Bei Huai.</p><p>After he summoned The Divine, Xu Xiaoshou only wanted to exclaim that the ancient martial arts were really too awesome.</p><p>On the turbulent Gong Yang Mountain, two figures, one tall and one short, hovered in the air.</p><p>“The Divine.”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“How do you start to study the ancient martial arts Six Paths?”</p><p>“As long as you have hands.”</p><p>“Do I need to learn the pre-requisite Eight Doors and the Seven Constellations first? I see that they only increase my combat strength, but the Hungry Ghost Path has nothing to do with them?”</p><p>“Ordinary people need it.”</p><p>“Then, what about the extraordinary ones?”</p><p>The Divine smiled.</p><p>He vaguely understood Xu Xiaoshou’s ambition.</p><p>He turned to look at the little brat…</p><p>When they first met, this little brat had an immature look on his face. He was as terrified of his existence as a mortal would be when he saw him.</p><p>The second time they met, this little brat seemed to have grown up overnight. He did not know where his confidence came from. It was as if he had been possessed by someone. He was calm and indifferent.</p><p>“What are you trying to say?” The Divine smiled.</p><p>“The Divine, do you believe in geniuses?” Xu Xiaoshou did not answer but asked this question instead.</p><p>The Divine was stunned.</p><p>Many figures flashed through his mind.</p><p>There were high-spirited swordsmen, poets who could calculate with their fingers, men who sat quietly, and compassionate Saint monks…</p><p>There were plenty!</p><p>In the end, all the figures would transform into him!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
