Why don’t you go to Heaven?”</p><p>Before he could say anything, his thoughts stopped at the moment when Bei Huai’s soul body was torn apart.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s battle consciousness was already very strong, and he could keep up with The Divine and Bei Huai’s reactions.</p><p>Of course, he could tell that Bei Huai’s soul body was not completely powerless after the Three Eras Prison Realm was destroyed.</p><p>However, Bei Huai did not do anything. He allowed The Divine that maniac to tear him apart as if he was all too willing to die.</p><p>“So, what’s the situation now? Does it look like he’s dead?” Xu Xiaoshou pointed at the scene after the battle.</p><p>“He had a chance, but he gave up…” The Divine did not answer and only muttered to himself.</p><p>It was obvious that he could sense the same thing as Xu Xiaoshou, so he frowned and muttered to himself, “This meant that there was a better way to resist us than him protecting his soul body. It’s brewing in the dark…”</p><p>Was the tearing of his soul just a pretense, or was it an act to stall for time?</p><p>Was Bei Huai was still plotting something even more powerful to take down The Divine secretly?</p><p>“What is it?” Xu Xiaoshou asked thoughtfully.</p><p>“I don’t know.” The Divine simply shook his head.</p><p>“You don’t know?”</p><p>“I can only feel it, but it doesn’t mean that I know what they are thinking about. Just like how I’m only responsible for defending myself, I’m not responsible for the planning…” The Divine also gave Xu Xiaoshou a sideways glance. “This is exactly what I hate about you guys. You guys are always so conniving.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was silent for a moment.</p><p>This was truly a brainless boor!</p><p>The Divine’s intuition told him that there was danger, but he did not need to think about how to overcome the situation. Even if he did not, he would only lose a virtual image at most.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t do it!</p><p>He was about to be played, and the one who would die now was his true body!</p><p>“Move…”</p><p>“My brain…”</p><p>He looked around.</p><p>He could see everything in Gong Yang Mountain.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt his heart jump. It was a whim.</p><p>He didn’t dare to waste any more time. He immediately activated the Moment of Enlightenment. His thoughts were even smoother than if he had been constipated for ten days and had taken a laxative.</p><p>“His true body? No, it was impossible! In the shattered world, Bei Huai vaguely mentioned that the five Holy Emperors’ aristocratic families still had conflicts. The Holy Emperor’s true body came due to a cat… This was too ridiculous. It involved too many things and too many people. He might even be tied down by the other Holy Emperors and could not come out!”</p><p>“And under the Hungry Ghost Path, The Divine’s combat strength was truly not lacking. Bei Huai’s soul body was shattered, so be it. Even if the remaining fragments can be pieced together and revived, how much combat strength can he recover? He can’t even beat The Divine!”</p><p>“Yes. Also, logically speaking, there’s no reason for a Holy Emperor’s thought incarnation to be so weak, much less give up completely in despair under the Hungry Ghost Path… The Divine’s train of thought is correct!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind was extremely agile. He instantly made a connection and became extremely certain.</p><p>“Bei Huai’s soul body plotted to build a power that was even stronger than his Holy Emperor’s thought incarnation. He is willing to sacrifice himself for it. He is not only aiming for Greedy the Cat Spirit, but also for The Divine from the Hungry Ghost Path!”</p><p>This did not seem to be something that a hastily prepared Holy Emperor’s thought incarnation could do.</p><p>Or Bei Huai could send an even more powerful Holy Emperor’s thought Incarnation to fight against The Divine from the Hungry Ghost Path or even directly sent an incarnation of a Holy Emperor!</p><p>Or…</p><p>“Only the Holy Emperor can defeat The Divine!”</p><p>When he thought of Bei Huai’s ability and his research…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils trembled. When he turned to look at the sealed entrance of the secret realm in Gong Yang mountain, his gaze seemed to penetrate the entire world.</p><p>It was the most convenient, the least likely to restricted by the other Holy Emperors’ aristocratic families, and the most powerful force. It also required some time to be activated…</p><p>It was right in front of him!</p><p>“What have you come up with?”</p><p>The Divine didn’t like these sneaky people, but he also admired them. When he saw how Xu Xiaoshou’s expression changed, he immediately asked.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>Before Xu Xiaoshou could say anything, the entire Gong Yang Mountain shook and the sky turned dark.</p><p>“Woo!”</p><p>In the Four Symbols Secret Realm, the sky was black and rain pelted down. All the living things there shared the same sorrow.</p><p>The entire Holy Palace Trial process instantly came to a standstill.</p><p>The trial-takers weren’t the only ones who burst into tears as they lost control of their emotions.</p><p>The trial officers, the white and red-clothed people and even the demi-saint Mu Ling started to wail.</p><p>“Wuwuwu…”</p><p>Gong Yang Mountain was also affected.</p><p>However, they were separated by an extradimensional space after all. The Cutting Path Stage and the higher void level here could still control their emotions. They only shed tears and did not completely lose their ability to move.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>A great wave of panic filled the entire Gong Yang Mountain. The dark cumulus clouds that formed came from the thoughts of the people’s souls and could no longer be removed.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>“Fellow Daoists, run!”</p><p>“I don’t want to know what happened at all. Let me give you a piece of advice: If you want to live, run now!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned off his Moment of Enlightenment.</p><p>When he got the answer, the answer came out by itself too.</p><p>“Holy Emperor power!”</p><p>The Divine did not like to over speculate, but his battle sense was extremely sensitive. After he looked around, he said with a shocked expression.</p><p>“Isn’t this Bei Huai’s Holy Emperor power?”</p><p>“Little brat, you actually provoked two Holy Emperors at the same time? How dare you!”</p><p>You provoked this… Xu Xiaoshou held his tongue. He knew that he had a part to play. He immediately said, “It’s two, but it will also be one.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” The Divine was also curious.</p><p>At this time, the thirst for knowledge did not need to be so strong… Xu Xiaoshou didn’t have the time to explain the complicated triangular relationship between the Holy Emperor Qilin, Bei Huai, and Bei Huai’s research.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
