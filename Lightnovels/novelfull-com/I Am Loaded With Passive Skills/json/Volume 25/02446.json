It was the remnant of The Divine who blasted Bei Huai out of the extradimensional world.</p><p>At this moment, almost all the trial-takers of the Vermilion Bird lineage could see a huge bone pillar that hung from the huge hole in the sky.</p><p>This bone pillar extended all the way down and it had five distinct prongs and knuckles.</p><p>It looked like…</p><p>“A human hand?”</p><p>” A giant’s hand?!”</p><p>The trial-takers clutched their heads, their eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p>Just the wrist and palm that hung in the Four Symbols Secret Realm were enough to turn the world upside down.</p><p>One could just imagine how terrifying the owner of this golden jade white bone hand was.</p><p>“Why do these d*mned things always appear in this trial…”</p><p>“It’s fine if a giant Lord Shou came out of the Vermilion Bird lineage. Then, there was the even bigger Holy Emperor Qilin. Finally, the Ten High Nobles, The Divine and Bei Huai followed. Now…”</p><p>“And now, it’s this gigantic white bone hand again! Could it be defeated through human strength? Even a demi-saint would be smashed into pieces by its palm!”</p><p>“I just want to enter the Holy Palace…”</p><p>All the onlookers tried to guess the identity of the owner of the white bone hand.</p><p>However, after they mulled over it, other than the ghost beasts and The Divine, it seemed that there were no other creatures in the world that could conjure up such a ‘gigantic’ thing.</p><p>“Lord Shou?”</p><p>Someone thought of Xu Xiaoshou’s Golden Giant.</p><p>However, even that Golden Giant was like a firefly’s light against the moonlight when one compared it to the white bone hand.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>The white bone hand only moved its finger, and the surrounding space cracked.</p><p>Soon, some vitality flowed through it, and it had a bit more of the liveliness that a unique life form should have.</p><p>This huge hand withdrew from the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>“It left!”</p><p>“It went out!”</p><p>“I really want to go out and take a look…”</p><p>The phenomenon that descended from the sky was indeed a curious sight!</p><p>It just so happened that the hole in the sky had yet to be repaired completely, and the space-time flow had been shattered by The Divine’s attack.</p><p>The vague mirages that appeared all over the Shengshen Continent aroused the curiosity of all the trial-takers.</p><p>“It’s a form of the Illusion of Heaven and Earth!”</p><p>“Dao Glimpse Mirror, appear!”</p><p>The main characters who were supposed to be the trial-takers in the Holy Palace Trial were reduced to being extremely excited spectators. Each used their own method to trace the scenes that had happened in the outside world.</p><p>At the same time, the Heavenly Group’s combat channel also came alive with urgent reports.</p><p>“Array Eye No. 77, Zhou You is in position. A white bone hand has been spotted!”</p><p>“Array Eye No. 112, a giant hand appeared in the Vermilion Bird lineage. Please advise!”</p><p>“Array Eye No. 93…”</p><p>In the direction of the Vermilion Bird Golden Tower, Yu Zhiwen looked away and her eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>She had a clearer view than anyone else that the dao pattern fluctuations that flowed from the white bone hand that suddenly appeared belonged to a familiar yet unfamiliar person.</p><p>Familiar, as it pointed to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>What was unfamiliar was that even Yu Zhiwen couldn’t tell what had happened to Xu Xiaoshou’s body to be able to form such a white bone hand.</p><p>What mattered most was that…</p><p>Everyone seemed to have forgotten this point. Since it was a hand, where were the flesh and blood that should be on the white bones?</p><p>“Failed evolution?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s eyes were filled with worry.</p><p>She did not care how strong Xu Xiaoshou had become.</p><p>What she saw was that Xu Xiaoshou suffered severe injuries from the pressure exuded by the Holy Emperor Bei Huai.</p><p>After she hurriedly reported in, Yu Zhiwen couldn’t help but move her hands and conjured up the Heaven Secrets Curtain.</p><p>In the next second, she was shocked when she saw the ruins of Gong Yang Mountain, the Holy Emperor Qilin, and the White Bone Giant.</p><p>The ghastly white bones contained boundless power, but the pieces of flesh and blood that struggled and squirmed willfully between the bones looked rather pitiful.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s eyelashes quivered as she clutched her sleeves tightly.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao’s calm voice came over the Heavenly Group’s battle channel.</p><p>“All members of the Heavenly Group, listen up. Defend the Four Symbols Secret Realm and don’t come out for the time being. The extradimensional space is now the best shield for the Saint war.”</p><p>“But you need to take note. Pay close attention to the battlefield at Gong Yang Mountain and to Xu Xiaoshou’s status at all times.”</p><p>“Once he returns to his human form, at my order, the members of the Heavenly Group will immediately abandon all matters in the Four Symbols Secret Realm and leave the place to capture him.”</p><p>In an instant, all the confused members of the Heavenly Group seemed to regain their courage and responded strongly.</p><p>“Yes, sir!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was strong.</p><p>The White Bone Giant looked equally strong.</p><p>Even Hallmaster Dao had admitted that this was a Saint war; that meant that Xu Xiaoshou had grown to at least the level of a demi-saint.</p><p>But now, everything seemed to be under that person’s control.</p><p>When the Holy Emperor Qilin and the White Bone Giant fought to the death or both sides suffered heavy losses, they would then understand what it meant when…</p><p>Sit within the Saint circle and decide on life and death.</p><p>The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind!</p><p>“Me? Who am I?”</p><p>In the ruins of Gong Yang Mountain, Xu Xiaoshou only felt that he had been asleep for a century. It was as if he had only been in a trance for a moment before he woke up again.</p><p>When he opened his eyes, he saw a vast sea of clouds.</p><p>Under the sea of clouds, ants and all sorts of living things floated about.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>“Qilin world?”</p><p>The various powers in his body were still being consumed crazily.</p><p>If he lacked spiritual source, his mental strength would undergo a transformation to replenish it. If he lacked mental strength, his soul power would undergo a transformation to make up for it.</p><p>At the same time, the Heavenly Ancestor’s power and the power of the Dragon Ancestor also participated in the circulation of their own powers.</p><p>Under the foundation of Eternal Vitality and High Spirits, these would contribute to his ‘sobriety’.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
