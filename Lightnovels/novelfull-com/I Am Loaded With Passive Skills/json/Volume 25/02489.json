His mouth was oily and his clothes were stained and dirty.</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>He suddenly choked, and his eyes bulged. He hurriedly took out a bottle of water from his pocket and drank two mouthfuls.</p><p>After he recovered, he patted his chest and heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>“Oh, that scared me to death!”</p><p>“Fortunately, I still have a bottle of water…”</p><p>He threw away the remaining sauce-flavored meat pie without giving it a second thought.</p><p>He mounted his horse and took out a black pouch embroidered with cloud patterns from his inner pocket. After he weighed it in his hand, the coachman’s plain face turned bitter.</p><p>“There’s no money to be earned from this order!”</p><p>“Oh? A new friend?”</p><p>“Or is it a big fish…”</p><p>In the Hundred World spiritual array, Dao Qiongcang glanced at Xiang Yaoyao. He conjured up a divine picture and asked, “Do you know this person?”</p><p>Aunt Xiang didn’t say anything, and she did not even look at the person in the picture.</p><p>She only looked at the Xiang family’s death warriors who were sacrificed and the members of the Ghost God gang scattered on the ground and sighed silently.</p><p>Those who came to support her, other than Ghostface, who was still breathing, had been trampled under Dao Qiongcang’s feet.</p><p>The rest of them were all dead!</p><p>The reason why Dao Qiongcang spared Ghostface was simple.</p><p>“Our Physique Division needs to study ancient martial arts.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang did not respond to this, nor did she dare to make a sound. She only regretted that she had crushed the red danger secret talisman before she left.</p><p>The original intention of the secret talisman was to let each family save their own lives.</p><p>Who would have thought that in the eyes of each family, their own family was far less important than Aunt Xiang.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was used to Xiang Yaoyao’s lack of response, so he didn’t mind.</p><p>To him, capturing Ghostface was just a casual feat.</p><p>It was normal for him not to gain anything in the path of ancient martial arts. However if Ghostface knew any ancient martial arts secret methods other than the Eight Doors and the Seven Constellations, it would be an unexpected bonus.</p><p>Now, he was more concerned about another person.</p><p>“Yama, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.”</p><p>This was a very special fellow.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had a deep impression of this person.</p><p>He still remembered that after he reviewed the Abyss Island incident, Dao Qiongcang had decided that the variable was Xu Xiaoshou. There was no doubt about it.</p><p>However, others would only pay attention to the shining moon and ignore the stars that accompanied the moon, but Dao Qiongcang would not.</p><p>As far as he knew, there wasn’t only one master on Abyss Island.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, Water Ghost, and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man were equally important.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was never a firm believer in results only. He was also concerned about the one who played an important role in the process.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man and the Blood World Pearl were undoubtedly the absolute creators of the turning points of each fighter.</p><p>This person’s role in that battle was not any lesser than Xu Xiaoshou’s.</p><p>In a sense, it was even better!</p><p>Therefore, after the passive Great Sensing Technique triggered the Great Abnormality Technique, he sensed that someone was spying on him.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang immediately used the Great Visualization Technique to move the most realistic image into his second brain.</p><p>The Great Sensing Technique of the Divine Thirty-Six Form could detect any abnormal attention, peeping, hostility, and killing intent and any other actions that might negatively affect him.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang would be able to detect even a Holy Emperor peeking at him as long as his intentions were unclear.</p><p>With the Great Memory technique, he wasn’t affected by powers such as Guidance and forgetfulness.</p><p>After he discovered this, if necessary, he could activate the Great Visualization technique, that was also one of the Divine Thirty-Six Form’s energy movement secrets. Through the Way of the Heavens and the Holy Path, the surrounding images of the person who did this would be displayed in the second brain- the divine secrets brain.</p><p>The area covered the entire Shengshen Continent. Dao Qiongcang had already traveled to the five domains of the continent in advance.</p><p>Even the Five Great Holy Emperor secret realms were included in the scope of his Divine Array, so they were also covered by the Great Visualization Technique.</p><p>That array eye might be a blade of grass or a rock. Dao Qiongcang would never tell anyone this secret.</p><p>It was worth mentioning that the second brain was not in Dao Qiongcang yet, but in the Dayan Grotto-Heaven in the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>For one thing, if a small demi-saint saw something bad, he could create another if his second brain was blown up. However, it would take more effort if his own brain was blown up.</p><p>Secondly, after being processed by the second brain, the images that were worth sending to the main body’s brain would be sent, and the images that were not worth sending would be disposed off as garbage so as not to affect the main body’s mood.</p><p>But now, the second brain realized that there was nothing wrong with the image. The demi-saint incarnation could be seen.</p><p>Therefore, Dao Qiongcang, who was at the Southern Zone gate of Jade Capital City only tilted his head. Under the various Divine Secrets that he had prepared in advance, he saw the Five Decays of Heaven and Man in the distant Central Yuan world where there was almost zero time difference and zero distance.</p><p>When this path was so close at hand… No, when the figure appeared in his mind, the Great Memory technique rotated slightly.</p><p>A lot of important information about this person that Dao Qiongcang had deduced earlier emerged.</p><p>“The Five Decays of Heaven and Man, higher void level, Body of Decay… The last time the power appeared was outside the Lone Cliff and it also contained the Sealing Power. (Marked in red).”</p><p>“The Five Decays of Heaven and Man, demi-saint, semi-saint person Blood World Pearl, Body of Decay, Immortal Body… Ye Xiao’s Body of Death. If it underwent sanctification with the help of the Blood World Pearl and died again, there is a chance that it will evolve into an Immortal Body. (Marked in red).”</p><p>“Dongtianwang City, Heaven Prayer Forest, Jiang Xian, Three Loathsome Eyes…The Lei Family’s Eyes had fused with a new host. Most of them were incompatible. A small number of compatible ones required a lot of time to adapt. After it became compatible with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, the eyes opened in a very short time.(Marked in red).”</p><p>“Abyss Island First Hall of Sins, Divine Oracle’s energy movement had triggered the second law of protection. Request to remove the restriction was granted… Number Two encountered the Body of Devour. The key characters in the backtracking image are Xu Xiaoshou, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, and so on. (Marked in red).”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
