The scene of Xiao Kongtong pretending to be his Teacher on Abyss Island flashed through his mind.</p><p>He realized that his impression of Bazhun’an when he was young was actually from Big Mouth Xiao. It was really absurd.</p><p>Soon, Xu Xiaoshou waved his sleeves and puffed out his chest, as if he was wearing the skin of Bazhun’an. He said angrily,</p><p>“In the future, if I succeed, I dare to laugh at Bei Huai for being unmanly!”</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin trembled.</p><p>Needless to say, this sentence really stunned Bei Huai.</p><p>Whether it was his aura, tone, or the unique feeling of Bazhun’an…Too strong!</p><p>Bei Huai was indeed waiting here because Dao Qiongcang had asked him to come forward. He said,</p><p>“If Xu Xiaoshou is in trouble, he will definitely ask for help from Bazhun’an. If you are free, you can help me and keep that person as long as he appears.”</p><p>That person was naturally Bazhun’an.</p><p>Bei Huai thought that Xu Xiaoshou could really call Bazhun’an over with a communication bead.</p><p>He didn’t expect that this kid could only convey the content and couldn’t even call half a person over.</p><p>However, the tone used by Bazhun’an was too arrogant!</p><p>Forget about the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>Everyone was on the same level, Bazhun’an was indeed unruly and no one could control him.</p><p>Decades had passed, but most of the Ten High Nobles were still in the same place, and some of them had even regressed.</p><p>He, Bei Huai, had already become a Holy Emperor and was only half a step away from completing his Great Path.</p><p>If Bazhun’an dared to be arrogant in front of him again…Heh, this person only dared to hide and act wildly in front of a Holy Emperor’s thought incarnation.</p><p>Did he really dare to appear in front of his true body?</p><p>“I’ll remember it.”</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin’s deep blue eyes were filled with coldness as he spoke.</p><p>“What else did he say?” The communication bead simultaneously transmitted the voices of Bazhun’an, which were devoid of any emotion.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath and lowered his voice.</p><p>“He said, ‘I’ll remember it!’”</p><p>Pausing for a moment, Xu Xiaoshou took another breath and said coldly and mockingly,</p><p>“He also said, ‘Saint servants are a bunch of scoundrels, and Bazhun’an is a rat who only knows how to hide his head. When he achieves his ambition in the future, he dares to laugh at the Saint Servant for not being a man!’”</p><p>Ta.</p><p>Unable to call Bazhun’an over, Xu Xiaoshou angrily cut off the communication bead. He thought to himself,</p><p>“Hiding rat!”</p><p>“I’m talking about you!”</p><p>“Go ahead and guess. Some of these words are true and some of them are false. I’ll let you cheat me!”</p><p>“If you dare to trick me today, my Huai Bao will charge into the Saint Servant’s gate tomorrow and fight with you, you damned old man…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts surged, but he quickly suppressed his emotions. He put down the communication bead and looked at the Holy Emperor Qilin with his innocent eyes.</p><p>“Speak.”</p><p>“It’s hard to say…”</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>Just as the Qilin finished speaking.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pouted his lips, and his face scrunched up like a chrysanthemum. He imitated Bazhun’an perfectly.</p><p>“Yo, yo, yo, ‘I’ll remember it’. Does he think he’s that flamboyant Elder Dao? Do I have to be afraid that he’ll remember me?”</p><p>“Uh, Bazhun’an said. These are his original words.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately reverted to his gentlemanly appearance. He felt the fluctuations of Bei Huai’s soul, which was boiling, and said nervously,</p><p>“I’m only responsible for delivering the message. When two countries are at war, they shouldn’t kill the envoy!”</p><p>Damn it, they were just chasing after his Greedy the Cat Spirit. Shouldn’t he be causing a scene between him and that damn Elder Dao?</p><p>After all, the two families of the North Path were so close.</p><p>He wanted to see if he, Bei Huai, still dared to listen to the words of that flamboyant Elder Dao without any precautions and come and catch him again!</p><p>And once the Holy Emperor Bei Family was on guard, with Elder Dao’s suspicious personality, wouldn’t he become ill with suspicion?</p><p>And if this continued…</p><p>Hehe, the crack in his heart would either not appear, or it would appear, and it would never be repaired!</p><p>Bei Huai was really disgusted by Xu Xiaoshou’s tone.</p><p>Although they were on opposing sides, he dared to say that Bazhun’an was not that kind of person.</p><p>The content of this sentence might be 80% true, but the tone was definitely embellished by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He was trying to make fun of him!</p><p>“Are you done?” But soon, Bei Huai’s soul returned to normal.</p><p>“I’m done.” Xu Xiaoshou put down the communication bead and sighed.</p><p>Right now, he was praying that the powerful helpers of Bazhun’an would appear as soon as possible. Otherwise, he would definitely be pursued relentlessly.</p><p>After all, he couldn’t always be alone. There would always be a time when he had to come out of the water to breathe…Sigh!</p><p>“Do it yourself, or let me do it.”</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin’s gaze landed on Greedy the Cat Spirit, which was resting on Xu Xiaoshou’s chest.</p><p>This ghost beast thought Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to hide in his small world anymore. Otherwise, he would lose another realm.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not answer but made a final struggle.</p><p>“Bazhun’an told me to wait for him for fifteen minutes.”</p><p>“Senior Bei Huai, I have a brilliant plan!”</p><p>“Let me and Greedy the Cat Spirit go this time, and I’ll give you that Bazhun’an and his people who will be coming to save me in 15 minutes. What do you think?”</p><p>Betraying Saint Servant, of course, couldn’t be done so easily.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou even thought of a backup plan. He said with an unusually clear mind,</p><p>“But after that, I had nowhere to go. I wonder if your Holy Emperor Bei Family…Hmm, do you accept people?”</p><p>“I’m also quite interested in your research. We’re actually the same kind of people.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou threw the communication bead over.</p><p>From an outsider’s perspective, he didn’t seem to be the weaker party. Instead, he seemed to be the master of the situation, able to control the life and death of the Holy Emperor Qilin.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
