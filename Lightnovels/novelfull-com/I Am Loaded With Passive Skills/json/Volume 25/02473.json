They could not tell if the sky had collapsed or if the giant had descended.</p><p>Outside the city, the earth and the mountains shook, while the people in the city were safe and all was calm.</p><p>There was a long queue to enter the city from dawn to dusk.</p><p>When the sun set in the mountains and rose again in the morning, the golden osmanthus trees that lined the roads filled the city with its fragrance under the morning sun.</p><p>The fragrance wafted for thousands of miles as it passed through the shouts on both sides of the street, the feet of children at play, and the noses of the Spiritual Cultivators who were meditating…</p><p>The fragrance of the osmanthus drifted into Changle Street, into the Yougui Pavilion, and into the third floor amidst the group of poets and refined scholars who were playing finger games, drinking, and laughing.</p><p>“Pa!”</p><p>The door closed.</p><p>Aunt Xiang landed on the bed.</p><p>She took out a ring from under her pillow and put it away. She did not stop to remove her makeup and instantly took out a communication bead.</p><p>“Dongdong, Mei’er, Ah Yao, come up to the third level now.”</p><p>After a pause, she seemed to remember something and instructed.</p><p>“Call Yingying and Qiao’er too.”</p><p>A few greetings and responses came from the communication bead. Aunt Xiang cut it off and crushed the bead.</p><p>She pinched a white osmanthus flower between her fingertips.</p><p>After she crushed it, a delicate fragrance filled the room. Soon, the space in her palm shattered. She threw the communication bead powder into the spatial fragment.</p><p>“Hmm…”</p><p>After she pondered for three breaths, Aunt Xiang took out another jade talisman from her chest, crushed it, and threw it into the spatial fragment.</p><p>This was the ‘Red Danger’ secret talisman, that was bound to the leaders of the Xiang family, the Ghost God Gang, and the intelligence agencies affiliated to the Yougui Pavilion.</p><p>Once this talisman was broken, the leaders of the various factions would receive a notification.</p><p>“The situation is already so bad that we don’t have time to inform the various families. You guys are on your own.”</p><p>After she crushed the ‘Red Danger’ secret talisman, footsteps could be heard from downstairs. Aunt Xiang slapped her head, and a hint of annoyance appeared on her face.</p><p>“Oh no, I’m really a little fool!”</p><p>She suddenly remembered Xu Xiaoshou’s reminder.</p><p>Not everyone in the Ghost God gang was a good person.</p><p>Although it was highly unlikely that the leader who received the message from the secret talisman was someone from the Holy Divine Palace, what if he was?</p><p>“I am still too soft-hearted…”</p><p>However, when she thought about it, if she didn’t say anything, perhaps after tomorrow, those few factions would be in a blood bath.</p><p>Perhaps, she might not even be able to protect her roots.</p><p>Aunt Xiang had imagined this scene countless times, but she never thought that she would have to face it one day.</p><p>Now when she looked at it again, she realized that regardless, she would crush that jade talisman. It didn’t matter if she had any regrets or not.</p><p>“As long as I’m still here, as long as The Divine is still here, Elder Dao would not dare to be extreme… right?”</p><p>Aunt Xiang’s eyes were filled with worry.</p><p>She got up and walked to the window, but she did not open it. She only looked out through the papered window.</p><p>Amidst the haze, Jade Capital was blanketed in snow and looked peaceful.</p><p>She took off her dress and unfastened the sealing belt around her chest, layer by layer.</p><p>Very quickly, her aura silently rose to the higher void level.</p><p>“Hu…”</p><p>Aunt Xiang looked out the window and exhaled softly.</p><p>The faint golden fragrant mist gathered with the chirping of the birds at dawn in Jade Capital City and drifted into the flowers and osmanthus trees that bloomed all year round.</p><p>They had become a part of the city.</p><p>The fragrance that lingered in the city all year round had also become a part of Aunt Xiang’s spiritual senses.</p><p>Aunt Xiang closed her eyes and her eyelashes quivered slightly.</p><p>“Hurry up! Hurry!”</p><p>“Move quickly and be quiet!”</p><p>“Those who can escape into the Way of the Heavens, all of you, escape into the Way of the Heavens. Don’t leave any traces. This mission is coded ‘red’, the most dangerous level!”</p><p>“Hee hee, be quiet…”</p><p>“Don’t talk! Don’t say anything related to the mission! Are you trying to kill me?!”</p><p>“Everyone, shut up!”</p><p>Knock knock.</p><p>There was a knock on the door.</p><p>The eavesdropping was interrupted. Aunt Xiang opened her eyes that were filled with coldness.</p><p>“As expected of you, Elder Dao the Flamboyant. Your actions were faster than my thoughts…”</p><p>She changed into her usual casual black gauze dress..</p><p>After some thought, she took out a rag doll from the drawer, and the look on her face softened.</p><p>The doll was only the size of half a palm. It was bald and had big eyes. There were many obvious pinholes on its body. It was obvious that the maker’s craftsmanship was very crude.</p><p>It had on a pink gauze dress and looked lively and cute.</p><p>“I love you.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang cradled the doll that The Divine had personally made for her, looked up at the door and regained her composure.</p><p>“Yingying, Qiao’er, please come in first.”</p><p>As soon as the door was pushed open, the three women waited respectfully. Two of them stepped in, surprise and uncertainty in their eyes.</p><p>As soon as the door closed, Aunt Xiang drew out two rings and gave them to the two of them. She said indifferently.</p><p>“There’s a yellow spatial transmission jade inside. After you go out, find a hidden place and crush it. Leave the capital and never come back, even if I have to look for you personally.”</p><p>“As for the other stuff, consider them as a dismissal payment. They are also a gift for your travel expenses. Remember not to reveal your wealth.”</p><p>“From today onwards, you are free.”</p><p>Yingying and Qiao’er felt as if they had been struck by lightning. Their faces paled and they were about to fall on their knees.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Aunt Xiang, but Yingying doesn’t know what she did wrong…”</p><p>“Aunt Xiang, what is going on…”</p><p>Before the two of them knelt down, they were helped up by a gust of wind that contained a faint fragrance. Aunt Xiang said calmly.</p><p>“It’s not that I don’t want you guys anymore.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
