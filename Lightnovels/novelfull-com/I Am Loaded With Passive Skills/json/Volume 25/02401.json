What scent?”</p><p>“Just… a smell…”</p><p>“A smell? You can even detect Xu Xiaoshou’s scent?”</p><p>“Yes… I… we… in… the… White… Cavern…”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“Nothing! I actually perceived it wrong! I’m sorry!”</p><p>The young girl’s fluttering heart, like aimless wind, carried away into the void, unfurled myriad scenes, shaping countless beautiful stories impossible to articulate in words.</p><p>Until the voice in the Heavenly Group’s combat channel grew incredibly solemn, serious, and deep:</p><p>“Yu Zhiwen! Report!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s delicate body trembled.</p><p>At that moment, her starry eyes shook, hastily responding to Hallmaster Dao’s words.</p><p>“I-I’m here!”</p><p>“Were you possessed? It took six calls to get a response. Are you now Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“N-No… how could I have anything to do with Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen waved her hands frantically, as if Hallmaster Dao were right there questioning her, stumbling through her explanation: “I have no… connection with Xu Xiaoshou… um…”</p><p>The entire Heavenly Group’s combat channel fell abruptly silent.</p><p>Even the reports being made halted at this moment.</p><p>Standing atop the Pearl Tower, Yu Zhiwen felt as if struck by lightning, her mind going blank.</p><p>Just as her hands dropped, her astrolabe fell, the clatter louder than any saint calamity, prompting her to quickly bend down and pick it up.</p><p>What was she saying?</p><p>Wasn’t this just making things worse?</p><p>No, there was nothing between them, why would there be any thoughts of covering up… Why was she so nervous?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s chest heaved rapidly, her thoughts in disarray. After taking a deep breath, she finally calmed down:</p><p>“Vermilion Bird Golden Tower, Yu Zhiwen in position.”</p><p>“Good. What were you doing just now?”</p><p>“Picking up… inspecting the astrolabe…”</p><p>“Don’t be too engrossed. The Four Symbols Secret Realm is not the Path Division, and now is not the time for you to indulge in Divine Secrets. Remember to keep a part of your mind alert, and focus on the Heavenly Group’s combat channel.”</p><p>“Oh, okay.”</p><p>On top of the Vermilion Bird Golden Tower, Yu Zhiwen gripped her astrolabe, listening to the resumption of reports from all around, letting out a long sigh of relief.</p><p>What was this feeling of narrowly escaping death…</p><p>Before she could even celebrate the fact that she hadn’t been caught slacking off, Hallmaster Dao paused for a moment, his soft and serene voice came through again:</p><p>“Now is the time for a private conversation. Don’t worry, others can’t hear the following.”</p><p>Thud!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>A private conversation…</p><p>Why would he want to talk to her privately?</p><p>At that moment, the fear in her heart was like those early days in the Path Division.</p><p>In the classroom of Divine Secrets, any mistake would be pointed out by Hallmaster Dao; any lapse in concentration would be met with his scrutinizing gaze.</p><p>Those who hadn’t studied Divine Secrets couldn’t understand the terror of Hallmaster Dao—he could see every detail, spot every mistake; he pursued “absolute perfection”!</p><p>So, what did Hallmaster Dao see?</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao…”</p><p>“Little Yu, this isn’t the classroom, no need to be nervous.”</p><p>“O-Okay.”</p><p>“Then, can you tell me now, did you notice anything unusual?”</p><p>“N-No… nothing unusual…”</p><p>“Nothing? Then why did you suddenly check the astrolabe?”</p><p>“I… Yu Zhiwen stumbled for words, “Just… routine check?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
