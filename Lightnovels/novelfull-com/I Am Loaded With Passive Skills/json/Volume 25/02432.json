They used their spiritual senses to eavesdrop on their conversation and couldn’t help but fall into deep thought.</p><p>It was a conversation that sounded extremely arrogant to outsiders. They looked down on everyone in the world.</p><p>It was also a very rebellious conversation about the research of the Physique Division. They betrayed the step by step ancient martial arts.</p><p>The Divine didn’t find it strange.</p><p>He himself was a genius.</p><p>The surprises that other people had limited vision to and could not be exposed to forever were all ordinary to him.</p><p>Therefore, how could he not believe that there was really a genius in this world who could achieve it overnight?</p><p>Even if Xu Xiaoshou were to close and open his eyes and immediately achieved sanctification, the Divine would be able to accept it. He had already suffered that kind of shock many times!</p><p>It was just like how Xiang Yaoyao couldn’t understand The Divine and Xu Xiaoshou back in the Yougui Pavilion, but The Divine could understand Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>At the same time, The Divine realized.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Four Symbols Secret Realm exploded with a loud bang.</p><p>Everyone’s emotions were stifled. The Vermilion Bird Golden Tower was sent flying again, and a magnificent black horn poked out from the ground.</p><p>The Holy Emperor’s might covered the entire scene.</p><p>The earth shook, mountains and rivers collapsed, and there was no longer any concealment.</p><p>After the horn emerged, black fog surged and condensed. Vast and endless ghost beast energy spewed out.</p><p>For the first time, the Holy Emperor Qilin’s head appeared from the Four Symbols Secret Realm!</p><p>“This?”</p><p>Mu Ling wiped away his tears and his eyes were filled with shock. “Where’s the seal…”</p><p>He seemed to have thought of something. He looked up at the sky and roared. “Dao Qiongcang, do you want to destroy the Shengshen Continent? What are you trying to do?”</p><p>What was he doing?</p><p>The answer was obvious.</p><p>A Qilin, covered in black scales, crawled out from the ground. Just a single swipe of its claw was enough to crush the entire Vermilion Bird lineage.</p><p>It didn’t deliberately cause any damage. It just remained silent. Step by step, it climbed steadfastly from underground to the sky of the Four Symbols Secret Realm. Then, it directly broke through the world barrier.</p><p>The Qilin lifted its head. Its deep blue eyes locked onto a certain spot on the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>The trial-takers were not the only ones who witnessed all of this. There were also all the people and Saints who were still conscious in the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>“Ghost, ghost beast?!”</p><p>“Heavens, it crawled out! What’s going on? Why is there such a thing here?”</p><p>“Who was it looking for? Could its targets be Bei Huai, The Divine? Or…”</p><p>“Saint Servant Lord Shou???”</p><p>They looked at the Holy Emperor Qilin’s shackled four limbs. The Path Principles had turned into chains, and the four symbols prevented it from moving forward.</p><p>The Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Black Tortoise appeared.</p><p>These four virtual images appeared, but they cried as they came out.</p><p>They appeared on the four Golden Towers in the four corners of the Four Symbols Secret Realm and transformed into Sealing Power to prevent the Qilin from leaving.</p><p>However, even as they tried to stop it, they cried as if they were making subtle confessions.</p><p>The Sealing Power was useless. It could not stop the Holy Emperor Qilin at all.</p><p>Those who saw this didn’t dare to think beyond that.</p><p>What did they see?</p><p>The Holy Emperor Bei Huai seemed to be helping the ghost beast Qilin to escape?</p><p>Gong Yang Mountain.</p><p>When the Qilin’s head appeared in the sky above this world, the black fog that covered the sky gathered into dark clouds. The scalps of the spectators who had gathered to watch directly exploded.</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>Everyone fled for their lives at the same time.</p><p>What ‘ceremony’, what ‘chance of life and death’, what ‘maybe if both of them were to suffer heavy losses, I would obtain the inheritance’. This might be a ‘just in case, but what if…</p><p>These were all forgotten!</p><p>At this moment, everyone realized that they had been exposed to the greatest terror of the world when they saw Holy Emperor Qilin’s Power of Demons and Beasts. Their eyes were filled with horror.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Amidst the hysterical screams, the two still figures in the void still remained unmoved.</p><p>They sat and watched the birth of the Qilin and laughed and chatted.</p><p>“You want to learn the Hungry Ghost Path?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Are you confident?”</p><p>“Things can only be done thrice and I’ve seen it twice.”</p><p>“You can enter the Ran Ming ruins to look for me…”</p><p>“I can’t wait.”</p><p>“Then, at this moment?”</p><p>“Right now!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
