Spirit, Dao, Qi, Intent, Method…”</p><p>“The ‘void’ doesn’t actually exist, it only arises in correspondence to the ‘substance’, hence naturally devoid of concepts like limits, extremes, or supremacy.”</p><p>“When the ‘void’ reaches or approaches its ‘peak’, if one can harness this power, it would be truly terrifying…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils trembled, his thoughts diverged, moved by this ancient martial arts philosophy, continuing to deduce:</p><p>“And martial artists, using the Hungry Ghost Path among the Six Paths, temporarily store their thoughts that are originally stored in the soul within the body; then, they transform the originally ‘void’ soul into ‘substance’ through the Gate of Hell—thus switching to the form of the soul, which is the Hungry Ghost.”</p><p>“Not only that, corresponding to this transformation, the once ‘substantial’ physical body also becomes ‘void,’ enabling the true body of ancient martial arts to harness immense, limitless, and insatiable energy, fueling its power to unprecedented levels!”</p><p>“This power was originally unusable by anyone, and undoubtedly no one could withstand it, so to use it, martial artists will inevitably deplete their vital energy and require replenishment with Holy Medicine.”</p><p>“But it’s also this power that strengthens the martial artist’s physical body in the ‘void’ state, thereby stimulating the Hungry Ghost in the ‘substance’ state, thus achieving the most primitive and insane amplification.”</p><p>“Or amplifying and strengthening every aspect of the divine soul…”</p><p>“No wonder! No wonder The Divine’s Hungry Ghost Path can contend against Bei Huai!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou slapped his head, feeling that the points he couldn’t comprehend before were now fully integrated.</p><p>“Enlightened!”</p><p>“Enlightened again!”</p><p>This kind of ancient martial arts philosophy was unprecedentedly outrageous.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou had to figure it out on his own, who knows how long he would have to ponder, or even where he could step into this gate.</p><p>But now…</p><p>With the cryptic incantation of The Divine, combined with the elevation of one’s realization quality almost to an unlimited extent through the Spirit Dao Disc and the Unity of Man and the Heavens…</p><p>Following his epiphany of the Three Streams of Red Plum Blossoms, his mind was filled with concepts of transformation between void and substance…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he had been enlightened, making progress day by day!</p><p>He clenched his fist suddenly, his face aglow with excitement, unable to be contained.</p><p>“I’ve grasped two of the Six Paths!”</p><p>His thoughts abruptly halted, and Xu Xiaoshou realized another very serious problem.</p><p>“No, how do I summon the Gate of Hell?”</p><p>It was too frustrating!</p><p>In an instant, Xu Xiaoshou felt suffocated!</p><p>This feeling was like discovering a great treasure hidden in his body, as long as he opened that door, he could become… well, a Hungry Ghost King.</p><p>But the key…</p><p>Ah, it was just not there!</p><p>“Sign a soul contract?”</p><p>“This damn empty talk is an insight, a separation of soul and body. Tell me how could I possibly sign it!”</p><p>“The Hungry Ghost Path…”</p><p>Above Gong Yang Mountain, Holy Emperor Qilin looked at the golden power of the White Tiger, penetrating through the Hungry Ghost form of The Divine.</p><p>The sense of powerlessness was like The Divine’s punch in the Human Realm Dao before, which failed to hit Bei Huai’s soul body.</p><p>Separated by yin and yang!</p><p>But…</p><p>Bei Huai had already seen a similar method once.</p><p>The Divine could make it work with one punch, tearing apart his soul body, leaving only a trace of remnant soul…</p><p>Could it really succeed a second time?</p><p>“An ignorant man.”</p><p>“You only know how to throw punches blindly, but you don’t know… your divine soul is boiling excessively!”</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin’s eyes held a hint of mockery, a soft chuckle escaped his lips, and the shackles on his limbs clinked.</p><p>The Hungry Ghost leaping out from the Gate of Hell hadn’t even reached him yet, and the power of the five elements surged from Bei Huai’s body.</p><p>This kind of power, rotating and generating each other, finally converged, turning into the pure power of the Holy Emperor’s divine soul.</p><p>It accurately anchored the soul fluctuations of The Divine at the moment of its transformation into the Hungry Ghost, rapidly expanding and spreading out, probing into various regions of the five domains.</p><p>In a split second, the gaze of Holy Emperor Qilin shifted.</p><p>“Not in the City of the Dead Bodhisattva?”</p><p>“But in…”</p><p>Bei Huai was somewhat surprised.</p><p>He discovered that the entity linked to the fluctuations of The Divine’s soul wasn’t far away. It was right here, within the ruins of Ran Ming in the Four Symbols Secret Realm!</p><p>“Divine assistance.”</p><p>The City of the Dead Bodhisattva still had its own rules.</p><p>In the ruins of Ran Ming, what remained was the legacy of the god slayer.</p><p>In search of an heir, the legacy of Ran Ming embraced all things, even declaring to search for individuals within the heavens and earth, naturally not paying much attention to the intervention of the Holy Emperor’s power.</p><p>“Just a bit of power, and he will crumble to dust!”</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin made a move.</p><p>It ignored the Hungry Ghost rushing towards itself.</p><p>It formed a giant Hand of Divine Soul, attempting to sever the connection between the true body of The Divine and this incarnation.</p><p>As long as the bond was broken…</p><p>This Hungry Ghost, which could hardly even be considered a demi-saint’s thought incarnation, would only turn into rootless duckweed and disintegrate on its own, right?</p><p>Bei Huai was silently laughing.</p><p>Previously, as just a thought incarnation of a Holy Emperor, he didn’t dare to pursue the true body of The Divine through this method.</p><p>He believed that a slight sensitivity or counterattack from the other party would undoubtedly lead to his death.</p><p>However, with the restrictions of the Ran Ming ruins and the support of the Holy Emperor Qilin’s power, even if he only had a remnant of thought left, and even if the true body of The Divine could be traced back to him, he could still contend to some extent.</p><p>Moreover, Bei Huai never intended to confront head-on in a thankless struggle.</p><p>There were many ways to obliterate The Divine.</p><p>Cutting off the connection, since it was the easiest way, why not do it?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
