We’re just passing by. We can’t stay for long.” Bazhun’an shook his head and poured wine for them.</p><p>The third floor of the Flower Pavilion fell silent.</p><p>You could hear a pin drop.</p><p>“Wah!”</p><p>The uncontrollable crying broke through the soundproof barrier and could be heard on the first and second floors of the pavilion.</p><p>Lady Bai Yezi…</p><p>She cried…</p><p>Crying so loudly?</p><p>This was a big shock.</p><p>However, the thirteen beauties downstairs looked at each other as if they had not heard anything. They did not dare to disturb the gathering.</p><p>“Sob, sob, stay one more day, just one more day!” In the three-story pavilion, Bai Yezi hugged Bazhun’an’s legs and collapsed onto the ground as she sobbed.</p><p>“Tsk tsk, you’re already so old, yet you’re still crying. Aren’t you embarrassed?” The Storyteller crossed his slender legs and was speechless.</p><p>“It’s none of your business!” Bai Yezi turned and bared her teeth at him in anger. However, there was no malice at all, she only looked cute when she did that.</p><p>“Just look at your snot. It’s exactly the same as it was thirty years ago. Come, come, come…” The Storyteller took out an image recording bead. “I’ll help you take a photo so it can be circulated to the thirteen beauties of your Flower Pavilion.”</p><p>“Ah! Ning Hong Hong, I’m going to kill you!”</p><p>“Sigh, but I can’t catch you!”</p><p>The Storyteller got up from the stool he sat on and ran away, while Bai Yezi grabbed the plate and chased after him, barefooted.</p><p>The two higher void levels circled around the Flower Pavilion and smashed countless porcelain onto the ground. They circled around the pavilion for a total of eighteen times, but she still could not catch up with the other.</p><p>Hei Yezi was about to faint.</p><p>But today, when her big brother turned up, she almost couldn’t hold it in. Her sister was destined to lose control.</p><p>She was happy. Looking at the playful scene, it was as if she had returned to the past. She no longer made any remarks about being ‘unladylike’.</p><p>“Big brother, why have you come this time?” Hei Yezi looked at this familiar yet strange face that she had not seen for so long.</p><p>Bazhun’an put his wine cup down.</p><p>Bai Yezi stopped her pursuit and jumped to the side of the table to hug her brother’s leg. She raised her head like a kitten, her eyes filled with anticipation and worship.</p><p>Bazhun’an had no choice but to rub her head. “First of all, I came mainly to see you both. After all, it’s been so many years…”</p><p>“Yes, yes.” Bai Yezi’s tears instantly turned into a smile as her eyes filled with happiness.</p><p>“Secondly, Xiang Yaoyao is in trouble.” Bazhun’an’s expression turned serious.</p><p>“Sister Xiangxiang?”</p><p>Bai Yezi jumped up and dashed to the side of the bed. “Where is it? Where is it…”</p><p>Hei Yezi slapped her forehead helplessly and took out a jade scroll from her bosom. She handed it over and said in a serious tone.</p><p>“We received the news not long ago. We were just about to send it to the Storyteller…”</p><p>“Yougui Pavilion where Sister Xiangxiang was located has been destroyed. The person who attacked should be Elder Dao the Flamboyant himself.”</p><p>“If it’s not anything else, she must have been trapped by the Divine Secret technique. That’s why I can’t sense or contact her.”</p><p>The jade scroll recorded everything that had happened in Jade Capital City.</p><p>Not surprisingly, this information would blow up the entire Central Region in a few days and everyone would know about it.</p><p>However, Dao Qiongcang had acted very promptly and didn’t trust anyone. Thus, only a few people knew the inside story.</p><p>Hei Yezi paused for a moment and continued.</p><p>Li Fugui from the Flower Pavilion is currently in Lord Shou’s First Pavilion in the Sky and carrying out work in Jade Capital City.</p><p>“He received Sister Xiangxiang’s message. If it wasn’t for Sister Xiangxiang’s final move, we might not even know anything about this incident.”</p><p>“Li Fugui had already planned something, but if the opponent is Elder Dao the Flamboyant…”</p><p>Hei Yezi had no illusions about this.</p><p>A mere Li Fugui was no match for any of the Ten High Nobles, let alone Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>“That fellow’s attack is not that simple.”</p><p>Bazhun’an set aside the jade scroll and lowered his head and no one knew what his thoughts were.</p><p>The third floor of the Flower Pavilion fell silent again. No one dared to make a sound to disturb them. Bai Yezi tiptoed to the side with the wine jug and squatted next to him to warm up the wine.</p><p>“How is Xu Xiaoshou? Not long after, Bazhun’an looked up and asked.</p><p>“After he defeated the Holy Emperor Qilin and the remnant soul of the Bei Clan, he was severely injured. I think he went into his small world to rest.”</p><p>“So strong?” The Storyteller covered his mouth. Some of the false information he had received from the Southern Region were actually true?</p><p>“Hmph, Lord Shou had long surpassed you!” Bai Yezi appeared at the side and glared at him. After she poured out the wine, she pinched the flesh of his thigh viciously as an act of revenge.</p><p>“Hiss.” The Storyteller winced as he inhaled sharply. After he slapped her hand away, he muttered, “Not everyone likes to cultivate…”</p><p>Bai Yezi was stunned. She pursed her lips and did not say anything.</p><p>Bazhun’an tapped his cup lightly and suddenly turned to look at the three people in front of him.</p><p>“Remember this statement. No matter how complicated the process is, no matter what happens in the middle, there is only one purpose for Elder Dao to personally take action.”</p><p>“He doesn’t bother to target others. He did it to me before, but now there’s Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>Lord Shou…</p><p>Was he worthy?</p><p>“What?” Bai Yezi was slightly stunned. Her eyes were filled with confusion. “But he’s attacking Sister Xiangxiang. What does this have to do with you and Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Bazhun’an shook his head. Two door-shaped jade talismans appeared in his palm. “I have the secondary plane door now. I control the Outer Island of Abyss Island. He can’t find me.”</p><p>Then, he handed the two jade talismans over.</p><p>“The Half-Moon Residence might not be safe anymore. Elder Dao the Flamboyant even made a move against the Yougui Pavilion. Who knows when you will all be his next target?</p><p>“Take these jade talismans. If you break it at a critical moment, it will lead you to Abyss Island.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
