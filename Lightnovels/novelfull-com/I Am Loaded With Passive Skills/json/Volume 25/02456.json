There were only two seasons in a year, one was the cloudy season, and the other was the rainy season.</p><p>The sky here was always dark.</p><p>The world was shielded by a huge canopy of trees.</p><p>The few rays of light filtered through the dense foliage with great effort.</p><p>Different from the other four Saint Emperor secret realms, the Mournful Emperor realm made people feel cold and melancholic.</p><p>Being in this location made people start experiencing too many thoughts. If they were not careful, they would sink into a sea of emotions.</p><p>Some were hurtful, some were sad memories.</p><p>There was largely anger and fear.</p><p>To be able to find an emotion such as ‘joy’ in this place, one had to be at least a demi-saint.</p><p>This was the Mournful Emperor realm, the inheritance of the family of the Holy Emperor Bei. Even the other four great families were unwilling to set foot in this place.</p><p>There were not many people from the Bei family who cultivated in this Holy Emperor secret realm.</p><p>It was a bit too much to say that it was passed down from a single lineage. Ten lineages would be a very accurate summary.</p><p>In Bei Huai’s generation, there were less than a hundred people with the surname Bei in the entire Emperor realm.</p><p>Moreover, most of the people from the Bei family were eager to leave and didn’t like to stay in the Mournful Emperor realm.</p><p>For example, the new Seven Sword Deity Beibei grew up in the Holy Emperor clan under the Yunshan Emperor realm.</p><p>An ancient japonicum.</p><p>This was an old japonicum tree that was over ten feet tall. Its dark green foliage were luxuriant, and its black trunk was thick and sturdy. It looked very ordinary.</p><p>Other than its great age, it did not have any other characteristics that were noteworthy. It seemed to have returned to its original state and was no different from the other trees.</p><p>The old japonicum tree had taken root here for trillions of years. It had gone through countless eras, and its roots had penetrated the entire Mournful Emperor realm. It could move this world around in the spacetime fragments at any time.</p><p>Its thick canopy was the source of the darkness that blocked the sunlight. It was also a direct expression of Bei Huai’s melancholic nature.</p><p>After all, a single thought from a Holy Emperor could affect the entire world.</p><p>To a large extent, Bei Huai had taken over the position of the Holy Emperor person of the Bei Clan and signed a contract with the aged japonicum.</p><p>His heart reflected this Mournful Emperor realm.</p><p>A barefooted youth dressed in white squatted in front of this extremely tall and old japonicum tree. His face was as smooth as jade, and his eyes stared at the tender tenacious grass that managed to break through the ground despite there being no light.</p><p>“Life is so great…”</p><p>He murmured silently and his eyes showed no emotion at all.</p><p>However, in the surrounding area, there were all sorts of noises that did not fit in with the Mournful Emperor realm and there were several Bei Huai at the site.</p><p>“Eek!” This Bei Huai had his belly pressed against the tree branch and folded himself in half to play with his feet. He then scratched his fingernails and sniffed them. After he revealed a look of disgust, he continued to scratch and sniff and did not seem to tire of it.</p><p>“Hehe.” There was a chubby little Bei Huai who sat on a wooden horse under the tree and rocked away in enjoyment. He grabbed the two handles of the wooden horse and tilted it about happily.</p><p>“Whoosh!” There was another Bei Huai, who played on the swing. He was pushed by another Bei Huai, who was hard at work behind him. He flipped around the tree branch and finally hit the Bei Huai, who picked his feet, and both of them fell.</p><p>“Hahaha, it’s so fun, so fun…”</p><p>“Aiyo, are you looking for a beating?!”</p><p>“Kill me! Ahhh, kill me, or I’ll kill you!”</p><p>There was a female Bei Huai who was disguised as a man, a Bei Huai who was looking for trouble and stepped on people’s feet, and a Bei Huai who wanted to vent his energy and fought…</p><p>Everything that was meant to be was there.</p><p>Beneath the ancient japonicum tree, besides the dazzling array of numerous Bei Huai, there were also the corpses of all kinds of huge ghost beasts.</p><p>They had been casually disposed of, or had become nutrients for the japonicum tree. Some had yet to be studied and some still had their vitality breath. All of them trembled in fear.</p><p>The Bei Huai who was dressed in white, whose eyes were devoid of emotion as he stared at the grass, was actually the most normal one among all the strange Bei Huai.</p><p>Of course, he was also the most abnormal one – he lacked the Seven Emotions and Six Desires that humans should have.</p><p>In reality, all the Bei Huai were the Holy Emperor’s thought incarnations that belonged to the Beihuai who was dressed in white.</p><p>Different from the other demi-saints and Holy Emperor, each of Bei Huai’s Holy Emperor thought incarnations had their own personalities, wills, and temperament.</p><p>Some were arrogant, some were depressed, some were crazy, and some were dandies…</p><p>Bei Huai had been a melancholic person since he was young, and he was also a very inquisitive person.</p><p>Throughout his life, all of his wild and unrestrained ideas had been realized, and in the end, he had encountered an essential issue with life.</p><p>For this reason, he had conducted many research attempts and had also incorporated many of the ‘Bei Huai’ into his own body before he separated them.</p><p>He still had not found a satisfactory answer.</p><p>Life seemed to be an endless research topic. Bei Huai’s interest had not diminished by far.</p><p>As he sat under under the tree with his back against the ancient japonicum, Bei Huai, who was dressed in white and barefooted, drew up his knees. He took out a yellowed notebook from his waist and produced a pen.</p><p>The cover of the notebook was very ragged, or it could be said that there was no cover. There were only a few words written in large characters on the first page:</p><p>“Bei Huai’s life research diary.”</p><p>On the bottom left of the page, there was a small red flower, probably drawn by a mischievous little Bei Huai.</p><p>After he flipped through half of the notebook, the young man picked up the pen and wrote quickly.</p><p>“Year 13233 of the ancient tree calendar. The weather was cloudy and there was a light breeze.”</p><p>“The mountain air is still fresh. The breeze is mixed with the drizzle and mingled in it is the fragrance of the soil after yesterday’s rain. This makes one feel happy.”</p><p>“The birth of life is always worth celebrating. I want to record that today, Ah Ya broke through the earth!”</p><p>“Ah Ya is highly talented and I had great expectations for her. However, when she was born, she only had the aura of a first-grade spirit elixir and that was a bit of a disappointment for me.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
