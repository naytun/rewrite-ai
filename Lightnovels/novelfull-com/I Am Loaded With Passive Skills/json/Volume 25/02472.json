If ten were not enough, then a 100!</p><p>“This is too way overboard…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he did not need to plant 100 Upanishad.</p><p>There was no one in the Shengshen Continent he needed to use 100 Upanishad to defeat, not even Bazhun’an.</p><p>As for the large amount of Passive Points needed to purchase the Profound Dao Seed…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t intend to laugh, but he glanced at his inventory. His soul bloomed and his mind scattered flowers.</p><p>“Passive Points: 76225012.”</p><p>It was worth it!</p><p>This battle was worth it!</p><p>Although he had crippled himself, crippled his little junior sister, exposed the Lei Family’s Eyes and exposed the Spatial Upanishad demi-saint’s trump card…</p><p>What followed were all kinds of big problems.</p><p>The Holy Emperor Dao Clan, the Holy Emperor Bei Clan, and the Holy Emperor Rao Clan that he had offended before…</p><p>Three of the Five Great Holy Emperor aristocratic families had been provoked.</p><p>When he looked down, the Central Region had almost destroyed two realms. One Qilin had died, a quarter of the Four Symbols Secret Realm had exploded, and the rest were about to rot…</p><p>Oh, there was also the Ran Ming ruins.</p><p>“I’m sleepy.”</p><p>“I don’t want to think about it. I just want to sleep.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t think anymore.</p><p>He urgently needed to sleep and then wake up to count his gains from this battle.</p><p>He believed that after he added the points, he might or might not be at the Cutting Path Stage. It would not be so difficult for him to fight a Holy Emperor.</p><p>But before he closed his eyes, he still had some things to say.</p><p>“Fat cat, remember what I said before. Continue to control me and don’t stop until I wake up.”</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>“Senior Dragon Apricot, help me control the flow of time in the Apricot Realm. I want to go back and rest, but I have to wake up as soon as possible. At the same time, keep our spiritual fluctuations and that of Greedy the Cat Spirit’s, hidden. We can’t let him find us again…”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Master Dean!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou then turned to look at Ye Xiaotian, who was still undergoing his transcend the tribulation.</p><p>It was clearly right in front of him, and the range of the transcend the tribulation covered half of his giant shoulder, but he was not affected at all.</p><p>A Upanishad demi-saint was really powerful!</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was even careful not to affect himself while he underwent the transcend the tribulation-it was right in front of him, yet it was far away.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian did not care about the transcend the tribulation at all. He could even send a telepathic communication across.</p><p>There were thousands of worlds between him and the giant.</p><p>The tribulation he underwent was the supreme void tribulation. The thunderbolt was in an illusory and distorted form. It was the supreme saint calamity of the Spatial Path!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt exhausted after just a glance. He said weakly.</p><p>“I’ll leave the rest to you.”</p><p>“I will have to trouble you to deal with this spatial passageway.”</p><p>“If any accidents should happen, I will have to trouble you too…”</p><p>“Bah! Don’t jinx it!” Ye Xiaotian spat and his white hair fluttered in the wind.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had shattered the remnant soul and will of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>However, after Bei Huai’s soul sacrifice, the spatial passageway that was created by the Three-day Soul Shifting still stood there. It had collapsed on its own because it had no owner.</p><p>Initially, Ye Xiaotian had only paid attention to the saint calamity. He had only wanted to ensure that the collapse of the spatial passageway would not affect the Spirit Cultivators in the world below, so that the people would not suffer.</p><p>But he was really afraid of this Shou jinx!</p><p>He was afraid that a Holy Emperor would jump out of the collapsed tunnel after Xu Xiaoshou completed his enlightenment!</p><p>Ye Xiaotian hurriedly waved his hand.</p><p>With a bang, the damaged spatial passageway was pulled into the range of his transcend the tribulation. The power of the Holy Emperor was being eroded bit by bit.</p><p>“Jin Ren.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t used to leaving everything to someone else, so he directed the last sentence to his second true body.</p><p>“Hey, Boss, I’m listening.”</p><p>“If anything goes wrong, I’ll switch my will and you can control me. You can also use my treasures, but my safety is the priority.”</p><p>“Hehe…” Jin Ren laughed. He had been looking forward to this for a long time. The combat strength of his main body and his second true body was like Heaven and Earth.</p><p>“Don’t go overboard.”</p><p>After the last sentence, Xu Xiaoshou could not take it anymore.</p><p>At the same time he flashed into the Apricot Realm, closed his eyes and removed the Ultimate Giant, Moment of Enlightenment, Hungry Ghost Path, and Human Realm Dao that he had only dared to open but did not dare to close.</p><p>“Woo! Bang!…”</p><p>The world spun and felt weird.</p><p>His soul and will seemed to have sunk into the deepest part of the ocean, or soaked in a huge vat filled with different colored dyes as he bobbed up and down.</p><p>“+(Being suffocated, Passive Points),+1.”</p><p>“Meow.”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit looked at its naked and pale owner and cast the Three Loathsome Eyes. It saw the halo under its owner’s feet.</p><p>Not long after, its owner became so fragrant that it wanted to take a bite.</p><p>“Meow?”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit suddenly remembered something. It spat out its unconscious female owner and threw her beside its master.</p><p>Swallow it together!</p><p>Hurry up! It was so fragrant…</p><p>The silver-haired Lei Xi’er’s eyes were closed tightly. When she smelled the scent, she subconsciously wrinkled her nose. She opened her mouth to take a bite, but she only took in a mouthful of air.</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit clapped its paws. It was disappointed that it didn’t live up to its expectations. At the same time, its eyes flashed with excitement.</p><p>It maintained its Three Loathsome Eyes and spat out many fresh and tender spiritual herbs.</p><p>It waved its claws and summoned an alchemy cauldron, then threw its owner and mistress into it.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>In the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, the Dragon Apricot Spirit could no longer remain calm.</p><p>The things around this kid were all abnormal.</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit was shocked. It turned around and realized that it was the dragon. Of course, it could understand what the dragon meant.</p><p>What are you doing?</p><p>“Meow.”</p><p>Conducting alchemy.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>What Elixir was it refining?</p><p>“Meow.”</p><p>A fragrant Elixir.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Don’t mess around.</p><p>“Meow.”</p><p>I’ll give you one.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>That’s good.</p><p>Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, the Ultimate Giant suddenly disappeared. He waved goodbye to the world like a victor after a battle as he departed.</p><p>Natural and unrestrained.</p><p>This scene spread to the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe and the Saint Hall.</p><p>“Crack.”</p><p>The divine Sinan trembled and shone with a golden light.</p><p>Eighteen copper coins were placed on the table, heads up.</p><p>He used his fingers and made a divination. Dao light shone brightly, and the divination was auspicious.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang suddenly stood up, and his eyes glowed with an unprecedented light.</p><p>“Finally…”</p><p>“It’s here!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
