When the sun rose high up in the sky, it generally bustled with activity.</p><p>At this moment, there were very few people on the street. The passersby were in a hurry and none dared to linger about.</p><p>A small number of curious people who were there to nose around were also pulled into the shop by the waiter. He knew about the incident that took place and reminded them to be careful.</p><p>“What happened? Why are there so few people here today? I wanted to drink some tea to moisten my throat!”</p><p>“Shush, please keep your voice down. The Holy Divine Palace is busy with their stuff now.”</p><p>“Oh? Why’s that?”</p><p>“It seems that the white-clothed people caught a big one, probably one of the Ten High Nobles, Aunt Xiang. This matter seems to be related to the destruction of the Yougui Pavilion on Changle Street.”</p><p>“Aunt Xiang?”</p><p>“Yes, their fight took place in the bounded domain, so we couldn’t see the situation clearly. However, not long after the bounded domain opened, the Ghost God gang, headed by Ghostface, led a group of ancient martial arts masters and brazenly broke through the bounded domain in an attempt to save Aunt Xiang…”</p><p>“And then?”</p><p>“There been no news so far. After that, dozens of death warriors appeared. I guess they were from the Xiang family and also broke into the bounded domain.”</p><p>“Uh-huh?”</p><p>“That’s it. No one has come out. There’s already an inescapable net set up around Chaoling Street. No matter how many people had entered, none has left.”</p><p>“Hiss! The Ghost God gang’s master and the Xiang family’s death warriors have all gone. Was the leader of Holy Divine Palace a demi-saint? Otherwise, how could there be so many who were put down?”</p><p>“It seems like Hallmaster Dao had personally taken action, if I’m not mistaken”</p><p>“Ah, this…”</p><p>Hallmaster Dao personally had a hand in this?</p><p>This was a huge matter, and there was only this little commotion?</p><p>After the unknown person figured out the situation, he looked at Chaoling Street and then looked at the Southern Zone gate where the Holy Divine Guards stood nearby. He felt that after today, Jade Capital City would be in a turmoil…</p><p>No!</p><p>The entire Central Region would quake in terror.</p><p>At the Southern Zone gate, Dongdong held Ah Yao, who had a pipa in her hand. She shook her head silently and chose to walk back.</p><p>“Sister Dongdong?”</p><p>“We can’t get out! Not only are there Holy Divine Guards, but there are the auras of least three higher void levels. I can’t deal with any of them.”</p><p>“Sister Dongdong is a Spiritual Cultivator and can hide in the Way of the Heavens. You can leave first.”</p><p>“Heh, the capital’s great array has been activated. If any Spiritual Cultivator tries to escape from the Way of the Heavens, they’ll immediately record it down, and would instantly inform Hallmaster Dao. Wouldn’t that be a suicidal move? Besides, if I leave first, what will you do?”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Ah Yao felt totally confused.</p><p>Yougui Pavilion had been destroyed and Aunt Xiang awaited arrest. She was already at the end of her wits.</p><p>“Let’s just fight it out with them!” Dongdong looked back at Chaoling street and there was a hint of hatred that flashed in her eyes.</p><p>“But…” Ah Yao tilted her head as she recalled the scene of the Ghost God gang and the Xiang family’s death warriors that flew like moths into a flame.</p><p>She pursed her lips and her eyes were filled with grief.</p><p>“It’s impossible to win…”</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao has personally taken action…”</p><p>She left Chaoling street, turned into South Stream street, and went around to the edge of the battlefield.</p><p>Ah Yao hugged her pipa all the way. Her fingertips were cold and she felt that all the passers-by were looking at her, even the cats and dogs.</p><p>She had been walking with her head slightly lowered. Suddenly, her eyes paused and she saw a pair of familiar cloth shoes not far away.</p><p>Ah Yao was someone who noticed even the smallest details. She recognized the owner of this pair of shoes.</p><p>In the morning, when she called for a carriage outside the Yougui Pavilion, it was the owner of this pair of cloth shoes who took the order. The coachman was…</p><p>Old Zhao!</p><p>Ah Yao suddenly looked up.</p><p>Old Zhao wasn’t beside his carriage. He had walked out of Madam Sun’s noodle house. He wiped his mouth as he chatted with his coachman companion.</p><p>Was it an illusion?</p><p>Ah Yao lowered her head and felt a little paranoid.</p><p>How could it be that person? Were they all spies who recognized her and kept staring at her?</p><p>However, she did not give up. She pulled the unaware Dongdong closer. This was a subconscious action that she had developed after having lived in Yougui Pavilion for so many years.</p><p>Soon, she heard laughter.</p><p>“It’s only two Spiritual Crystals…”</p><p>“It’s not a big deal, Old Wu. You can just treat me next time, hehe!”</p><p>“Alright, alright, that’s it then…”</p><p>“Oh, right, remember to tell Old Li that he hasn’t returned the wine treat that he owed me. He should do it soon!”</p><p>Ah Yao had yet to react.</p><p>Sister Dongdong’s expression turned cold. With a flick of her fingers, two silver needles flew out.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>Old Zhao and Old Wu’s bodies trembled at the same time, and they fell limply under the shade of the tree, unnoticed by any one.</p><p>“Sister Dongdong?” Ah Yao’s face turned pale.</p><p>Dongdong did not say anything. She walked over and took out a crumpled piece of paper from Old Wu’s body.</p><p>“At the Southern Zone gate, Aunt Xiang, Dongdong, Ah Yao.”</p><p>“There’s indeed a problem!” Dongdong’s expression was cold.</p><p>Ah Yao looked at the piece of paper and felt slightly distracted. She then looked dazedly at Dongdong.</p><p>“Yes, there is a problem…”</p><p>“But if they were from the Holy Divine Palace, would they need to transmit information in such a discreet manner?”</p><p>Dongdong was stunned for a moment. She frowned and then relaxed.</p><p>“They should all be killed!”</p><p>“All of them deserve to die!”</p><p>Ah Yao wanted to say something but hesitated. She felt that Sister Dongdong was swayed by her emotions. In the end, she did not say anything and swallowed the words in her heart.</p><p>Was it possible that this was someone from the Yougui Pavilion?</p><p>After she killed the two of them, Dongdong didn’t seem to be satisfied. She turned to look at Madam Sun’s noodle house.</p><p>She had this thought: if the two of them had to pass messages on the street, what about when they were eating noodles?</p><p>Was there anyone else who had gone to seek help with something similar to the contents of this note?</p><p>“Sister Dongdong!”</p><p>Ah Yao saw the killing intent in Sister Dongdong’s eyes and was a little afraid.</p><p>“Hu…”</p><p>Dongdong finally calmed down and did not continue with her attack. “Let’s stay hidden first.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
