She was touched by Hallmaster Dao’s words.</p><p>It was just a casual reminder from an elder to a junior.</p><p>However, with the addition of that sentence in front, it was different.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao had taken a long time to reply and Yu Zhiwen waited nervously in the interim. Unexpectedly, she was not subjected to any lengthy questioning; instead he had said, ‘Follow your heart’.</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao, you know everything…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen didn’t want to lie to herself.</p><p>If she could guess it, Hallmaster Dao should have guessed everything too.</p><p>Under such circumstances, he did not say anything and left the decision to her.</p><p>“I’m sorry…”</p><p>The more Yu Zhiwen thought about it, the more touched she was. Her eyes turned misty, and soon her tears fell like pearls.</p><p>She held the astrolabe and huddled into a tight ball on the tower. She felt weak and helpless and apologized repeatedly.</p><p>“Sorry, sorry…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen shook her head and did not know what she apologized for.</p><p>Perhaps it was because she had hesitated between Xu Xiaoshou and the Holy Divine Palace; or perhaps it was because she had hidden some information and did not report it, or perhaps it was because of something else…</p><p>She just felt that Hallmaster Dao was so good to her and she had thoughts of betraying him. She really deserved to die!</p><p>She hugged her knees and curled up at the top of the tower. She heard the mournful cry of the wind and saw the sorrow of the grass. Her tears became even more uncontrollable.</p><p>“I’m sorry… Oh.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen choked on her own saliva and her face turned slightly red.</p><p>This was so unsightly!</p><p>A temporary sense of shame suppressed the girl’s out of control emotions.</p><p>In the hazy watery world, Yu Zhiwen looked around with tears in her eyes. She saw many people who squatted down and cried like her.</p><p>She was stunned.</p><p>Something was wrong!</p><p>Something was very wrong!</p><p>Near the Vermilion Bird Golden Tower, all the trial-takers cried and their wails echoed all around.</p><p>“Ahhhh, I am guilty, oh Zhao Chenxing…”</p><p>“I shouldn’t have stolen your jade talisman. I shouldn’t have eliminated you from the secret realm. I shouldn’t have stabbed you in the back just to gain points. I deserve to die…”</p><p>“I’m the one who should die! Just for a Saint Fruit, I personally sacrificed my brother… Ah! I’m not human!”</p><p>“I’m not human either! I’m an animal, I am. She, she, she, she’s my sister-in-law… Oh!” Sounds of gagging erupted!</p><p>“I’m sorry, I’m really sorry…”</p><p>Confessions abounded.</p><p>Everyone was in tears.</p><p>The most serious offender vomited as he repented. In the end, he even vomited blood, as if he wanted to purge his entire body before he released everything.</p><p>Not only were humans affected, but all the other living things were also in the same boat.</p><p>The mountains and rivers trembled, as if they repented for the millions of years of meaningless waiting.</p><p>The weeping beads of plants and trees seemed to lament the passing of beautiful things and the end of their numerous and lush growth.</p><p>When one looked around, all the living creatures and dead souls near the Vermilion Bird Golden Tower seemed to have sunk into an ocean of emotion that had spun out of control.</p><p>An intangible tsunami rose into the sky.</p><p>The fallen were like leaves in the lone boat.</p><p>Where is life, when would it be over; it is uncertain and life and death are indefinite.</p><p>“Sad Lord!”</p><p>Some of Yu Zhiwen’s faded memories cracked, and she recalled that she had read some information about this before.</p><p>During the War of the Ten High Nobles, there was one character called Sad Lord.</p><p>At that time, he had just cut off his foundational roots and almost underwent sanctification. His ability was to make all things cry wherever he went.</p><p>This ability seemed to be a funny trait.</p><p>However, the final result was that during the War of the Ten High Nobles, one of them, after a few days of confrontation with him, cried and repented and offered up the seat of honor willingly!</p><p>“Who was he again…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen wanted to cry and laugh at the same time.</p><p>After all, the scene where everyone hugged and cried in each other’s arms and repented was really a little funny.</p><p>In the end, her face turned solemn. She wiped away her tears and recalled that name.</p><p>“Bei Huai!”</p><p>At this point, Yu Zhiwen’s pupils trembled as she realized that something was wrong.</p><p>She was well aware of this name. Grandpa Yu had often mentioned it, and it was like thunder in her ears.</p><p>If Buddha held grudges, the prison should be full. If Bei Huai did not cry, the Heavens would also hurt!</p><p>Among the Holy Emperor aristocratic family, he was the first one from the new generation to inherit the Holy Emperor person and became a Holy Emperor!</p><p>Sad Lord was a thing of the past.</p><p>Now, Bei Huai had become the sad Holy Emperor!</p><p>“Beep.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen suppressed her emotions and pressed the Heavenly Group’s battle channel to report this information.</p><p>The Holy Emperor had appeared near the Vermilion Bird Golden Tower!</p><p>Did Hallmaster Dao expect this?</p><p>When thoughts were connected, the sadness became even stronger.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen couldn’t help but cut off her current thoughts. Her remaining sense of shame made her disconnect the call, cover her face, and cry out in regret.</p><p>“Mm…”</p><p>“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have reported it secretly. I’ve developed a bad habit.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, Supreme Master. I’m no longer the good child in your eyes, but I want my freedom.”</p><p>The sorrowful wind wailed and the girl’s emotions disintegrated on the Pearl Tower. Yu Zhiwen sobbed and repented everything from the present to the past.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Xu Xiaoshou, but why didn’t you listen to me and follow me back to the Saint mountain?”</p><p>“I’m sorry. I don’t have the right to condemn you…”</p><p>“Wow!”</p><p>It was totally different from the implicitness of the outside world.</p><p>In the shattered world, the Berserk Giant jumped up and clung onto the Holy Emperor Qilin’s body and cried.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Qilin. I lied… Uh.” After the Spirit Awakening was triggered, Xu Xiaoshou was terrified. “Why did I cling onto you?”</p><p>“I’m sorry…” The Qilin returned without the majesty of a Holy Emperor.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
