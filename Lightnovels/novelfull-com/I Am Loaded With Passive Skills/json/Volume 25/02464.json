It knew that if it stopped once in front of a Holy Emperor, it might not dare to attack again.</p><p>It did not care about the serious injuries it sustained and swung its sword repeatedly as it smashed Bei Huai’s remnant soul into pieces.</p><p>Bei Huai’s remnant soul was so weak that it could not even defend itself after the unexpected first strike.</p><p>However, as a Holy Emperor, his will could not be killed.</p><p>Even though the remnant soul had turned into powder, it still held great resentment. It controlled the Soul Scattering Nail and pierced almost every part of void general Hong’s body.</p><p>“Heavens!”</p><p>“This, this, this…”</p><p>When the few Spiritual Cultivators from the Qilin world and the Central Yuan world who cultivated the Dao of the soul body saw this, they were terrified.</p><p>It was also deeply ingrained into the Ultimate Giant’s eyes and shocked him immensely.</p><p>“Ah Hong…”</p><p>There were countless times when Xu Xiaoshou wanted to recall Ah Hong, who fought this bloody battle, back into his soul space. He was very anxious.</p><p>A demi-saint against a Holy Emperor was indeed a difficult task.</p><p>If this continued, even if Bei Huai’s remnant soul was killed, Ah Hong would not be able to survive.</p><p>Even Holy Medicine could not save him.</p><p>This was definitely not Xu Xiaoshou’s original intention. When both sides were at the end of their tether, this would be his last resort. His goal was, of course, to let Bei Huai, who was also a smart person, know that he still had the strength to fight, and then retreat.</p><p>Everyone was selfish.</p><p>Ah Hong was very important to him.</p><p>In Bei Huai’s eyes, it was probably just a weak demi-saint’s soul.</p><p>How could such a noble Holy Emperor choose to die together with an ant in his eyes?</p><p>Who would have thought that after this fellow was struck by the sword, he would also erupt in anger. He had given the impression that he would rather die than live in shame.</p><p>“Why did you have to do this?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not believe that a dignified Holy Emperor would not leave a way out for himself. At the very least, Bei Huai could abandon his soul body and escape with a thought.</p><p>However, when the battle situation reached this point, he couldn’t bear to see both sides suffer.</p><p>“Come back!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou ordered.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Void general Hong continued to fight with its sword. It actually wanted to disobey.</p><p>It could also tell that if it could not stop the Holy Emperor’s soul fragment today, the Soul Scattering Nail that could even pierce through its armor would easily destroy its owner’s weak soul.</p><p>“+(Protected, Passive Points),+1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were sore and his eyelids felt very heavy… He was about to close his eyes!</p><p>How could he not know that once Ah Hong withdrew his shield, his life would be in danger.</p><p>However, he believed that the Red Ghost Inscription was for mutual protection and was not a one-sided sacrifice.</p><p>“This is an ancestral order, return!”</p><p>When he once again gave the command to the void general as the Heavenly Ancestor’s descendant.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Ah Hong roared indignantly. With its badly injured body, it turned into a stream of light and returned to Xu Xiaoshou’s soul space.</p><p>Medicine…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly pulled out three or four of the Holy Medicine for the soul that he had prepared in advance and fed them to Ah Hong, whose soul was about to disperse.</p><p>At this moment, a crazed laughter came from the other side of the void.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you’re still too young.”</p><p>“Kindness doesn’t make you a soldier. On this point, you’re not ruthless enough to yourself and others.”</p><p>“And that is the root of your failure!”</p><p>There were only dregs left of Bei Huai’s remnant soul, but it still left behind a telepathic communication that echoed in the Nine Heavens.</p><p>He had made the right bet.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had gone all out as a last resort, was ultimately no match for him, who was determined to die!</p><p>As soon as the voice fell, the soul body that had dissolved into crystal powder scattered in the sky and burned with a cold flame as it squeezed out the last trace of power.</p><p>Extreme grounds…</p><p>He had to counterattack!</p><p>He had to drag someone down with him!</p><p>“Soul Sacrifice…”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s heart trembled.</p><p>Bei Huai’s remnant soul’s emotions were unconcealed. It was clearly determined to perish together with him even if it sacrificed its final will.</p><p>Vicious!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hated this kind of opponent.</p><p>However, he could not help but sincerely comment that this was a person who was even more ruthless than him and was also the most qualified opponent.</p><p>When one faced such a person, if one did not fight to the death, one would never be able to win.</p><p>Just as he had these thoughts…</p><p>“Boss, don’t!”</p><p>Jin Ren’s panicked voice immediately sounded.</p><p>With their connected minds, he completely understood what his main body wanted to do at this moment.</p><p>“You will die from the overdraft!”</p><p>“If you die, I will die too!”</p><p>Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen had a premonition when she saw the sad Holy Emperor’s soul burning and when Xu Xiaoshou withdrew the giant spirit.</p><p>It didn’t look like they were going to give up, but more like they were going to launch their final attack.</p><p>As for Xu Xiaoshou, he was so weak that he was even a little slower when he activated his skill!</p><p>“Something will happen to him…”</p><p>This was an intuition!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen looked around.</p><p>Subconsciously, she tapped the void with the tip of her toes and grabbed the astrolabe. She wanted to escape from the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>She even took out a bottle of blood that came from Grandpa Yu.</p><p>To her, not only could the Holy Blood summon the Saint Statue, but it could also stimulate the bloodline power and return to her original body.</p><p>However, at the same time, the calm voice of Hallmaster Dao came over the Heavenly Group’s battle channel.</p><p>“The time has come.”</p><p>“Everyone, get ready!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s pupils trembled, and her feet felt as heavy as lead.</p><p>Perhaps it was just a coincidence, but at the same time…</p><p>However, she also felt that Hallmaster Dao stood in front of her at this moment, and he had extended his hand to stop her.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen stepped out of the void and dashed toward the hole in the sky of the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
