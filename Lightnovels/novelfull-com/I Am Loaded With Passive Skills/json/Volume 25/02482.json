The power of the ancestral source was called the power of the Holy Ancestor.</p><p>To commemorate the Holy Ancestor’s remarkable achievements, the subsequent generations had different names for the power of the Holy Ancestor.</p><p>For example, the power of the Holy God, the power of the Holy Ancestor, the power of the Ancestral God, the power of the ancestral source, and so on.</p><p>There were numerous names.</p><p>In the end, as time evolved, the names unified.</p><p>People collectively referred to the earliest “power of the Holy Ancestor” as the “Power of Divinity.”</p><p>Even if there were nine other gods, namely the Nine Ancestors – Sword Ancestor, Demon Ancestor, Heavenly Ancestor, War Ancestor, Dragon Ancestor, Ghost Ancestor, Medicine Ancestor, and Time Ancestor…</p><p>The name “Power of Divinity” would only refer to the first ancestor, the Holy Ancestor, and was only used to commemorate him.</p><p>It was because not only did the Holy Ancestor establish the first cultivation sect, but it also guided the direction of cultivation for several eras for the subsequent generations.</p><p>The simplest example…</p><p>In the Spiritual Cultivation Era, the power of guidance left behind by the Holy Ancestor was like an immortal guiding the way, pointing out the path of Spiritual Cultivation.</p><p>How difficult was the path to attaining Godhood and becoming an Ancestor?</p><p>Although it was said that all roads lead to the same destination in Great Dao, the different paths before reaching that “destination” couldn’t be underestimated in terms of difficulties and dangers.</p><p>However, in this era, the Spiritual Cultivator only needed to follow the path of the higher void step by step. After sanctification, they would be able to receive the favor the Holy Ancestor in ancient times left behind and obtain the “Holy Power”.</p><p>After the “Holy Power”, if one could become a Holy Emperor, the higher-state Holy Emperor…</p><p>Apart from those who had inherited the legacies of the other Nine Ancestors and walked different paths, Spiritual Cultivators could cultivate the power of the ancestral source and the power of the Holy Ancestor, also known as the Power of Divinity.</p><p>If one could surpass his master and break through the shackles of the Power of Divinity or walk a path different from other powers of the ancestral source…</p><p>The Ten Ancestors, or the Ten Godhood, should add on one more god.</p><p>It was “attaining Godhood and becoming an Ancestor.”</p><p>After Spiritual Cultivators reached the Holy Emperor State, people would gradually forget about them.</p><p>After attaining Godhood and becoming an Ancestor, the power of being forgotten and guidance, needless to say, would be even stronger.</p><p>The Holy Ancestor was not that bad.</p><p>As for the other Nine Ancestors, the legacies they left on this continent were rare, and most of them were legends.</p><p>The Holy Ancestor could still retain his legacy and start the entire Spiritual Cultivation Era because his power was still sealed on the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>The disciples of the Holy Ancestor had guarded the Holy God’s most primordial power since ancient times, and they divided it into two parts for preservation according to the “not putting all eggs in one basket” principle.</p><p>As the times evolved, the guardians also changed, and the names of each generation varied.</p><p>In the current era, the guardians were called the Holy Divine Palace and the Holy Palace.</p><p>Among the five lineages of the Holy Palace, the Spiritual God lineage was led by Zi Chong, who served as the guardian of half of the Holy Ancestor’s power in the present era.</p><p>Following that, the lineage of White Tower, led by the demi-saint Luo Shi, similarly guarded a portion of the ancestral power, the primordial power of the Dragon Ancestor.</p><p>Finally, it was the three lineages, which were Infernal, Saint Guard, and Dharma Gathering. One was in charge of external attacks, one internal defense, and the other law enforcement and research.</p><p>The three combined to protect the Holy Palace’s legacies and continue to nurture Saints and guardians.</p><p>It was said that “the mysterious clouds beyond the tangible realm were in the beginning, and the separation from heaven was below the four-hill mountain. The elderly Saints roamed through the vicissitudes of the world, one blue, one yellow, and both are immortals and sages.”</p><p>It referred to the Holy Palace’s transcendental status in the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>However, when the battle of the Holy Emperor erupted in the Shengshen Continent, it not only affected the two realms of the Central Region but also involved more than just the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>The Holy Palace, which was always aloof from the world, even had a meeting for this.</p><p>The Thunder Peak, led by Long Rongzhi of the Infernal lineage, held the authority of four of the five lineages of the Holy Palace.</p><p>The authority figure that had something to do outside and could not be present was replaced by the previous authority figure.</p><p>Dragon Breeder Lou Yu, Saint Guard Chi Jia, Da Yao, and Xiao Yao of Dharma Gathering, the four demi-saints all arrived at the scene.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>When the furnace exploded again, the weather on Thunder Peak changed drastically.</p><p>The dejected Long Rongzhi’s hand covered his thick hair and looked at the four people before him, shaking his head slightly, and said, “I will not show up.</p><p>“The Infernal lineage has already sent our disciple Mu Ling to the Four Symbols Secret Realm to take charge. It was initially the Saint Guard lineage’s matter.”</p><p>Long Rongzhi’s meaning was obvious.</p><p>Our Infernal lineage had done enough, even gone above and beyond. Always making us the ones to step forward, what did it amount to?</p><p>Chi Jia, the demi-saint of the Saint Guard was a square-faced, broad-shouldered, and sturdy man riding a shining shield. His face darkened upon hearing this.</p><p>His disciple, Wei An, was a steady person like him.</p><p>Otherwise, such a tremendous matter as the Holy Palace Trial in the Four Symbols Secret Realm would not be handed over to this steady new Saint to handle.</p><p>However, not long after the trial began, Wei An was dragged into the whirlpool by the people of the Holy Divine Palace and ultimately ruins of Ran Ming.</p><p>Chi Jia was of the same generation as Long Rongzhi. Although they looked sturdy, the hairs on their temples had long turned gray.</p><p>As a former authority figure, how could he possibly appear in the Shengshen Continent again because of such a small matter?</p><p>Therefore, Chi Jia entrusted his buddy Long Rongzhi of the Infernal lineage to step in and let this junior take charge.</p><p>Coincidentally, after Mu Ling’s undisciplined behavior in Yunlun and his idle life on Abyss Island were exposed, he would be freed from the confinement ordered by the Supreme Master. At the same time, he would do this new Saint a favor.</p><p>Mu Lin naturally accepted the order and went back to being idle again.</p><p>It was a pity that Bai Lian wasn’t a Saint. Otherwise, he wouldn’t even need to make this change.</p><p>Nevertheless, he was obviously much more diplomatic than Wei An. It was as if he did not go to the Four Symbols Secret Realm, though he did, and his sense of existence could be said not exist at all.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
