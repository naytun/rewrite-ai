This would really bring about the deaths of some people.</p><p>A Divine Sorcerer had to think of all options in advance to prevent the worst from happening.</p><p>“Sha…”</p><p>Only rustling sounds could be heard in the one-way battle channel of the Heavenly Group.</p><p>After a long silence, Hallmaster Dao’s emotionless voice sounded again.</p><p>“Really? There was nothing ‘out of the ordinary’ that happened?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen had a bad feeling.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao must have discovered something to ask this question.</p><p>She opened her Pearl Gem Star Eyes and quickly conducted a fleeting comprehensive inspection. Then she shook her head and said firmly, “No, there was nothing unusual!”</p><p>“Take a look at the astrolabe screen from 15 minutes ago.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s heart skipped a beat when she heard his cold voice.</p><p>Something had happened…</p><p>She silently reviewed the astrolabe from fifteen minutes ago and found that there was indeed a red glow near the Vermilion Bird Golden Tower.</p><p>However, that thing quickly disappeared. At most, it meant that a stowaway had passed by.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen didn’t stop her search.</p><p>It should definitely be more than that!</p><p>Otherwise Hallmaster Dao would not have been so serious!</p><p>She checked it carefully again.</p><p>Her gaze swept past the eye-catching red light beside her position that was captured by the astrolabe a quarter of an hour ago, but she did not linger over the sight.</p><p>That was because the dazzling red light looked like a part of the complex dao patterns on the astrolabe. It was not eye-catching at all.</p><p>In the end, Yu Zhiwen didn’t find any more errors, so she apologized with some doubt.</p><p>“I was careless. I should have reported this situation in time. There was a stowaway who passed by.”</p><p>Was this worth Hallmaster Dao’s effort to contact her?</p><p>The Heavenly Group’s battle channel fell into a rustling silence again while Yu Zhiwen waited nervously.</p><p>However, there was no reply for a long time.</p><p>In the Saint Hall, Dao Qiongcang, who had returned from the Wu Rao Emperor Realm, looked at the divine Sinan in his hand and sighed deeply.</p><p>“It must have been the power of oblivion…”</p><p>As the top person in charge of the Heavenly Group’s operations, the divine Sinan would naturally have established a connection with Yu Zhiwen’s astrolabe. When the Heavenly Group was in action, they would use the connection between the astrolabes to communicate.</p><p>He didn’t need to do much, everything that Yu Zhiwen’s astrolabe sensed was instantly transmitted to his divine Sinan without any errors.</p><p>This way, Dao Qiongcang could better detect and deal with all situations at the first possible moment.</p><p>He ascended the Stairway to Heaven and returned from the Wu Rao Emperor Realm.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang knew what he was doing. He used this to avoid the guidance of the Divine Light and retreated from behind the scenes. This would prevent a situation like what took place at Abyss Island when he was forced into the battlefield.</p><p>And it was during this short absence that the Ran Ming ruins, as expected, made an appearance!</p><p>With such a huge incident that took place, the first thing Dao Qiongcang did when he returned from the Wu Rao Emperor Realm was to review everything that had happened and tried to analyze all the information.</p><p>He fixed the Heavenly Group battle channel.</p><p>He also found out that in the short interim when he was away, everyone from the bottom to the elites of the Heavenly Group responded to all the messages, regardless whether they received a reply or not.</p><p>Everything that had happened was within reason. This included Yue Gongli and Ai Cangsheng, who were affected by the power of guidance and had entered the Ran Ming ruins.</p><p>However, something unexpected happened!</p><p>When he looked at Yu Zhiwen’s astrolabe, Dao Qiongcang had the same reaction as Yu Zhiwen. He had ignored the glaring red light that appeared on the Vermilion Bird Golden Tower. It was not the fleeting stowaway, but the second red light.</p><p>A long time ago, Dao Qiongcang had implanted a Divine Secret that would be passively triggered, into his body:</p><p>“Once you encounter the Guidance, forgetfulness, neglect, rebellion, coercion, and all the other unknown forces that cause emotional fluctuations such as over frequency, low frequency, excessive calmness, and thoughts interruption; it will trigger a memory recall to find the source of the error. If you can’t find it, you will continue to recall, and part of your mind will enter the state of ‘memory circle’.”</p><p>This was one of the Divine Thirty-Six Form of the Great Memory technique!</p><p>Once the Great Memory technique was triggered, Dao Qiongcang’s mind seemed to split into two.</p><p>The other half remained normal and carried out all usual actions in an orderly manner. Outsiders could not tell that he was in an abnormal state.</p><p>The other half would enter a state of vigilance and would broadcast any ‘abnormal status’ in his mind.</p><p>“Enter the ‘abnormal’ state. While maintaining your daily actions, you will constantly remind yourself from the lowest level of your mind that you have entered the ‘Holy Emperor’s Guidance’ and ‘Ancestral God’s Guidance’ state until the ‘and loop’ state is removed.”</p><p>This was one of the Thirty-Six Form of Way of the Great Abnormal Technique!</p><p>The two Divine Secrets were triggered passively.</p><p>Normally, it did not serve any purpose. When it was triggered, the enemy would be at least a Holy Emperor.</p><p>This was the method that Dao Qiongcang used to block the Five Holy Emperors’ aristocratic families and other unknown disturbances that prevented him from secretly conducting any heavenly research.</p><p>It used the most roundabout way to remind itself that it had been affected without leaving a trace. It had to resist while it obeyed and tried to find itself.</p><p>As for the principle of this Divine Secret, it was very simple. One could just use oneself as a Divine Puppet to operate it.</p><p>The power of guidance of a Holy Emperor was essentially to magnify and shrink certain human emotions and desires.</p><p>It was easy to break this kind of Guidance. If one was aware of it, they would ‘rebel’. If they were not aware of it, they would need a third party to remind them and then rebel.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
