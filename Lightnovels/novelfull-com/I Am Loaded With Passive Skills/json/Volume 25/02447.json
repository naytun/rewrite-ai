It even surpassed his attempt in the Apricot Realm.</p><p>At least in his current state, Xu Xiaoshou realized that the range of his Perception had almost expanded to the point where it could cover the entire Qilin world. He could see everything that happened.</p><p>Furthermore, when he thought about it, he realized that the entire world was within his general attack range.</p><p>Even the Holy Emperor Qilin that was invincible before was only knee-high in the eyes of the Ultimate Giant and resembled a child.</p><p>The Apricot Realm and the Shengshen Continent were very different!</p><p>The concept of the Ultimate Giant’s ‘limits’ in these two places was completely different!</p><p>But…</p><p>The consequences of being powerful were extremely serious!</p><p>Even though he had two of the power of the ancestral source in his body and had a feast when he devoured the Holy Emperor Qilin’s five elements energy in advance…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had activated his Moment of Enlightenment and the Ultimate Giant, but he could only reach half of his limit!</p><p>The Ultimate Giant was only a skeleton and had no flesh. It had become a White Bone Giant!</p><p>Even so, his strength still ebbed rapidly.</p><p>After a few auras, his condition dropped to zero.</p><p>At that time, the aftereffects of the double sleep… Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p>He couldn’t even guarantee that he would be able to stay awake after his second sleep!</p><p>Right now, the Holy Emperor Qilin and Bei Huai were waiting.</p><p>After a moment of shock, he didn’t even give himself time to think or rejuvenate himself again.</p><p>“Heavenly Bei Dharma Phase…”</p><p>The Saint Language suddenly sounded from the Nine Heavens.</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin slammed its claws forward as the monstrous power of the soul body surged out of its body.</p><p>Bei Huai was shocked.</p><p>He was truly moved by Xu Xiaoshou’s strength.</p><p>A mere Sovereign Dao Realm could actually use such power that could rival that of a demi-saint and even threaten a Holy Emperor.</p><p>This was an acknowledgement of the future generation.</p><p>However, after a pause, Bei Huai could also tell that the White Bone Giant was not in a good state.</p><p>While he was in the Holy Emperor Qilin’s body, Bei Huai’s strand of the Holy Emperor thought incarnation had turned into a remnant soul. This allowed him to borrow the Holy Emperor’s five elements and use a strand of his original body’s power.</p><p>How could he delay this great opportunity and let Xu Xiaoshou make use of his full strength?</p><p>I was careless…</p><p>I shouldn’t have waited just now. Dao Qiongcang misled me…</p><p>Regret was obviously useless. Bei Huai did not dare to delay any longer. After the hand seal was formed, the Saint Language was filled with sorrow and ghostly energy.</p><p>“Heavenly Bei Dharma Phase, Senluo Realm!”</p><p>With a strange sound, a dark green power spread out and filled half of the Qilin world.</p><p>At this moment, whether they were willing or unwilling, half of the people in the Qilin world sensed the descent of an abnormality.</p><p>They felt cold all over as a blast of wind whistled around their backs. They couldn’t help but prostrate on the ground and their souls trembled.</p><p>“What is this…”</p><p>“Trees? Ghosts? Ahh…”</p><p>In the Qilin world, the Spiritual Cultivators started to cry and scream.</p><p>Illusory, cold, transparent, dark green japonicum trees appeared out of thin air like ghosts with overhanging shadows.</p><p>The translucent soul body power condensed into a barrier that sealed the sky. The shadows of the japonicum trees meandered inside and formed a dense forest.</p><p>The japonicum trees looked ugly and ancient.</p><p>Their hungry branches seemed to thirst for blood and wanted to become immortal souls.</p><p>The tree branches drooped downward as if they subconsciously wanted to pierce into the souls of all living beings and feast upon them.</p><p>“Humph!”</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin snorted coldly.</p><p>The ghostly outlines of the japonicum trees in the Senluo Realm trembled and stopped in time. Their branches extended into the Great Path and absorbed the penetrating power.</p><p>Even if he wanted to deal with Xu Xiaoshou and take down Greedy the Cat Spirit, Bei Huai only had a wisp of his soul left. He would not forget what his true intention was and start his killing spree.</p><p>“It’s wrong!”</p><p>When the branches and roots set aside all the delicious food and subconsciously turned their heads toward the Great Path, Bei Huai spoke again.</p><p>This time, as if they had received approval, all the trees and ghostly shadows in the Senluo Realm lit up with dark green light and looked at the White Bone Giant.</p><p>The Qilin world seemed to be covered in a layer of hazy green fog.</p><p>In the mist, countless ghostly eyes flickered with the cold light of the will-o-wisps and emitted ear-piercing sounds.</p><p>“Woo!”</p><p>The voice of the Holy Emperor wreaked havoc in the world.</p><p>The weak Spiritual Cultivators were so frightened that they trembled and peed in their pants.</p><p>“Don’t kill me…”</p><p>“Sob, sob, let me go. I’m not guilty, I’m not guilty… Ahhh, I’m guilty! I shouldn’t have, shouldn’t have, shouldn’t have…”</p><p>“Uh-huh.”</p><p>Some people even suffocated on the spot.</p><p>Even if the shadows of the trees did not pierce their souls and absorb their power.</p><p>Once one sank into the sea of emotions, there were people who died of sorrow, people who died of shock, people who were infected by the emotional plague of others, and people who died of the same sorrow and shock and even more!</p><p>With the White Bone Giant’s current form, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even need to use his Perception to see through the Emperor’s perspective. He could tell that the Senluo Realm wasn’t targeting the Spiritual Cultivators in the Qilin world at all. It was only coming for him.</p><p>“This is bad!”</p><p>After they obtained Bei Huai’s approval, the endless ghosts and tree shadows plunged into the White Bone Giant’s body at lightning speed.</p><p>“Chi chi…”</p><p>The skeleton that was as solid as a rock was defenseless in the face of the soul body attacks.</p><p>When the stabbing sounds pierced through his mind, Xu Xiaoshou felt dazed.</p><p>“+(Attacked. Passive Points+) +9999.”</p><p>“+(Hypnotized. Passive Points,+) +9999.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
