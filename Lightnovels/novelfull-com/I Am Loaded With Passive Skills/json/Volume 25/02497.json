What’s the difference in the order it’s given?”</p><p>Jin Ren controlled the portrait clone and made it roll its eyes to the top of its head.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit did not say anything else. It waved its claw and released a scene.</p><p>It was the dilapidated battlefield of the Central Yuan world. The Five Decays of Heaven and Man and his semi-saint person the Blood World Pearl seemed to be talking about something.</p><p>Not long after, a star bridge was built in the distance.</p><p>The Divine Path Principles emerged and Dao Qiongcang suddenly appeared. He shattered the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s mask with a finger.</p><p>Under the mask was a human face.</p><p>However, at the critical moment, it turned into a huge black vortex.</p><p>The vortex exploded with a terrifying suction force and instantly swallowed all the energy in the surroundings.</p><p>This included a portion of the Dead Sea’s energy under the feet of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, the star bridge in the sky, and the Divine Path Principles that sealed his Holy Power.</p><p>“It is indeed the Body of Devour… Why aren’t you keeping it hidden anymore?”</p><p>From the perspective of the scene, Jin Ren could read the teasing content from Dao Qiongcang’s lips.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man didn’t say anything.</p><p>After he used the Engulfing Power to devour the shackles on his body, he acted like he avoided the God of plague. He did not even think of retaliating. He turned into a wisp of the power of the God of Death and fused into the Great Path to escape.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked into the distance and did not choose to pursue him.</p><p>On the contrary, he removed the two fingers that had shattered the mask of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and scratched the tip of his nose.</p><p>The Divine Elf that had been seen on Abyss Island before jumped out from Dao Qiongcang’s back.</p><p>Without even looking at the image, Jin Ren knew that the first sentence should be, “Elder Dao, Elder Dao.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s lips moved as he said something.</p><p>This time, Jin Ren could not read his lips.</p><p>“Get ready. Great God Descending Technique.” The Dragon Apricot Spirit suddenly said.</p><p>The people from the Apricot Realm were stunned and continued to look at the screen.</p><p>In the picture, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man who had just entered the Deadly Path suddenly appeared.</p><p>His body was bloated!</p><p>The long robe burst like a balloon that could not hold the energy inside and was about to explode!</p><p>The surrounding space and Path Principles shattered at the same time. Even the entire Central Yuan world fell into a strange spatial distortion!</p><p>Without a sound, the scene shook.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang stopped his movements.</p><p>The Divine Elf also stopped moving, and her small face was filled with pity.</p><p>However, the people from the Apricot Realm were horrified. After they looked at each other, they saw that their faces were extremely pale.</p><p>“Yama’s demi-saint Deva, self-destructed…”</p><p>Li Fugui muttered to himself and the shock still lingered in his eyes.</p><p>The game between these demi-saints made him confused and terrified at the same time.</p><p>However, Hallmaster Dao had only seized the initiative. Why did Yama’s Five Decays of Heaven and Man turn so crazy that he suddenly chose to self-destruct?</p><p>A demi-saint self-destructed…</p><p>Li Fugui could already imagine that the entire Central Yuan world might be buried with him!</p><p>“No.”</p><p>He suddenly came to his senses.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao was right there!</p><p>Perhaps the shockwave from the demi-saint’s self-destruction would not affect many people.</p><p>That was because Hallmaster Dao must have considered the extreme consequences and made preparations in advance to contain the explosion, right?</p><p>“The Five Decays of Heaven and Man, he died just like that?”</p><p>It took a long time for Jin Ren to utter this and he still could not believe it.</p><p>“Not necessarily.”</p><p>Li Fugui shook his head as he analyzed it seriously.</p><p>“Although it takes a month to refine a demi-saint’s incarnation, it’s impossible for an ordinary demi-saint.”</p><p>“However, from the scene, Yama’s Deva demi-saint has the Body of Devour… A month ago, he underwent sanctification. He paid a certain price to create a demi-saint incarnation.”</p><p>“Therefore, after he self-destructed, there were only two ways to survive!”</p><p>“Firstly, he can reincarnate in an unknown place to piece together his soul body, recover his physical body, and gather the power of his previous life. This process may take several years or even decades. If that’s the case, he’ll basically be crippled. He won’t be able to keep up with this era.”</p><p>“Second, he refined the demi-saint incarnation. Like the gecko that discarded its tail, he took a step back and revived in the incarnation…” Fugui believed that it was most likely the latter.</p><p>After he heard this, Jin Ren felt dizzy.</p><p>So, after the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had been touched, he chose to self-destruct his main body. He didn’t even want his treasures and only wanted to escape?</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Jin Ren felt that the body of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man housed a big secret.</p><p>However, when he saw this in the scene, he felt that the secret on his body was no longer a secret in Dao Qiongcang’s eyes.</p><p>What prompted him to self-destruct was Dao Qiongcang’s final action.</p><p>“Great God Descending Technique, what is that?”</p><p>This question was still in his mind. At this moment, in the gradually fading scene in front of him, Dao Qiongcang was still gazing into the distance when suddenly…</p><p>He turned around!</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>Jin Ren was truly shocked.</p><p>Fortunately, after the Dragon Apricot Spirit trembled, it waved its claws and shattered the image in time.</p><p>“D*mn it!”</p><p>“Why did you show that to me?</p><p>“Can’t you take a look and then explain it to me?”</p><p>Jin Ren was shocked and angry. He almost controlled the portrait clone to attack the Dragon Apricot Spirit. Fortunately, he remembered that it was the ancestral tree and a senior.</p><p>In the end, Elder Dao the Flamboyant clearly sensed something…</p><p>Perhaps he saw him peeping?</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit seemed a little embarrassed. It felt that it was too much of a bother to tell him about it, so it was better to watch it together. Now, it was a little afraid.</p><p>“Ancestral tree mind connection. This scene was transmitted by the blood tree through the Blood World Pearl.” The Dragon Apricot Spirit looked away.</p><p>Blood tree?</p><p>Seven Trees Emperor?</p><p>What did this mean? The Seven Trees Emperor sent such a scene…</p><p>Jin Ren’s first reaction was that the Blood World Pearl wanted to harm him.</p><p>After he paused for a moment, he felt that this was a little like the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s way of asking for help?</p><p>No!</p><p>It was all an illusion!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
