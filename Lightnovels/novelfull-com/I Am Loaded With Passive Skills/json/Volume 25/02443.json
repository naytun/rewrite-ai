I can’t take it!”</p><p>This lousy title was too torturous.</p><p>Every time he was called, he would be dug into the ground.</p><p>They had agreed that they could communicate with Holy Emperor Qilin. As long as they allied, they could conquer Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>However, the moment they met, they provoked the Holy Emperor Bei Huai, one of the Ten High Nobles. Now, even The Divine had been defeated, and he was the only one left.</p><p>He didn’t get anything, and he even got himself into trouble!</p><p>Fortunately…</p><p>Fortunately, the communication bead was connected.</p><p>Since he could still communicate with Bazhun’an, there should still be room for redemption, right?</p><p>“I saw your old friend.”</p><p>After saying that, Xu Xiaoshou glanced at Qilin, who was looking down at him. He lowered the communication bead and blocked it with his spirit source. He then said loudly,</p><p>“Bazhun’an said that you haven’t seen each other for a long time and he missed you.”</p><p>“He even asked me to tell you to give him some respect. He said that if you leave now, you still have a way out!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said in a threatening tone.</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin hovered in the air, but it didn’t do anything.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the information bar. Other than “affected,” there were no “doubts” or “speculations.”</p><p>That f*cking Bazhun’an said that the higher one’s level was, the more respect they would give you.</p><p>Where’s that respect?</p><p>He was nothing!</p><p>“Oh? Who is it?”</p><p>The communication bead transmitted the doubtful voice of Bazhun’an. Xu Xiaoshou sneered and replied,</p><p>“Cry. Can’t you hear the crying everywhere? Who does it remind you of?”</p><p>“I told him that you wanted to speak to him. This fellow did not give you any respect at all. He even said…”</p><p>“Bazhun’an? This child is playing a child’s game, why would an adult play along? Was this something a human should say? He even treats you as a child!”</p><p>“Uh, I don’t mean to sow discord. I don’t know your past, whether you are friends or enemies. I’m just telling the truth,” Xu Xiaoshou added an explanation to prove his innocence.</p><p>Of course, he would not leak his telepathic communication.</p><p>With the power of the Heavenly Ancestor and the Dragon Ancestor acting as a barrier, it would be difficult for Bei Huai to hear the conversation between him and Bazhun ‘an.</p><p>Although he did not know what Bei Huai was waiting for…</p><p>However, after adding fuel to the fire and fanning the flames, Xu Xiaoshou no longer cared about what Bazhun’an had to say. He put down the communication bead and “relayed” it clearly,</p><p>“Uh, though it’s a bit difficult to say, but in times of war between two nations, not harming the envoys is a basic principle, right? Is it okay if I say something?”</p><p>Seeing that the Holy Emperor Qilin did not move, Xu Xiaoshou continued,</p><p>“Bazhun’an said that if you don’t become a Saint, you’ll become a servant. And even if you become a Holy Emperor, you’re nothing. One can become a Holy Emperor simply with a thought.”</p><p>“Let me explain, Senior Bei Huai. Bazhun’an probably didn’t treat you as some filthy, disgusting dog shit. He’s just that arrogant. I’ve tolerated him for a long time.”</p><p>“He also said that the Holy Emperor is not the end. Becoming a Saint is just a matter of putting yourself in prison. Either you don’t become a Saint or you become a God. He told you to take care of yourself and think about the previous proposal…”</p><p>“It’s the suggestion to give him some respect and leave,” Xu Xiaoshou added carefully after a pause.</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin’s deep blue eyes remained calm. It was completely unmoved.</p><p>Soon, the voice of Bazhun’an came from the communication bead. He could not hear Xu Xiaoshou’s accusation against him. He was only at the Acquired Stage, he was a good-for-nothing.</p><p>“…Even if it’s him, you don’t have to worry. He won’t be able to reach you personally.”</p><p>“For this reason, I’ve even found the strongest helper for you. When you’re in prison, he’ll appear in time.”</p><p>Bazhun’an even helped him find someone?</p><p>The strongest helper?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up. This was the level of a starting Holy Emperor. Was the helper someone he knew?</p><p>Was it the Holy Emperor of the inner island of Abyss Island or the Ten High Nobles?</p><p>Although Aunt Xiang had misspoken once, she had said that only the Nine High Nobles could fight the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>After gaining confidence, Xu Xiaoshou became even more unscrupulous. He held the communication bead and sent a message,</p><p>“This Bei fellow really did not have a single humanity in him. I just wanted him to give you some respect. Not only did he mock us, but he also said that after today, he will come looking for us.”</p><p>“He even said, he even said things like ‘the Ten High Nobles are already at the peak’, ‘Of course the downhill path will be smooth’, ‘Not only Abyss Island, I’ll naturally make a trip to the other four great clans, including the Yue Clan’…Ugh, I can’t listen to this anymore!”</p><p>Putting down the communication bead, Xu Xiaoshou looked back at the Holy Emperor Qilin. His thoughts were not in a mess at all.</p><p>He hesitated for a long time with a complicated expression. In the end, he wanted to say something, “I don’t dare to say this…”</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin had spoken.</p><p>When he said this, Xu Xiaoshou immediately knew that Bei Huai had not broken through the barrier of his Heavenly Ancestor and Dragon Ancestor.</p><p>Or rather, he didn’t care about eavesdropping at all.</p><p>He was still waiting, perhaps because he had given Bazhun’an some respect, or perhaps…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of Rao Yaoyao, who also had a liking for waiting, on the Lone Cliff.</p><p>Perhaps, in Bei Huai’s eyes, he was just an accessory, and Greedy the Cat Spirit was the most important.</p><p>However, if he could fish out Bazhun’an after taking down Greedy the Cat Spirit, it would be icing on the cake.</p><p>Something was wrong.</p><p>Bazhun’an should be Dao Qiongcang’s goal?</p><p>He thought about how Bei Huai had appeared here and how Dao Qiongcang was behind it.</p><p>This ‘wait’ might be Dao Qiongcang’s way of dealing with Bazhun’an. Xu Xiaoshou immediately knew what to say.</p><p>“Bazhun’an said, ‘The one with the surname Bei is both a chess player and a chess piece. In the hands of that flamboyant Elder Dao, even if a Holy Emperor jumps, can they still jump out of his palm?’”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
