Who was sanctified as the Holy Emperor?”</p><p>The spirit of Dragon Apricot shook its head slightly, uttering just one word before fading back into the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer:</p><p>“Sword.”</p><p>Sword?</p><p>An ancient swordsman, sanctified as the Holy Emperor?</p><p>Jin Ren’s heart swelled with joy. Did Bazhun’an stand up?</p><p>But soon, he slumped back down. It was impossible. If he were to become the Holy Emperor, the force would surely be overwhelming.</p><p>He might even directly teleport to the Apricot Realm to resurrect his true self and charge the Sacred Mountain together.</p><p>But if it wasn’t Bazhun’an, then who else?</p><p>Apart from Eighth and Xu Xiaoshou, the only plausible candidates based on the word “sword” are the Seven Sword Deities.</p><p>Of course, it couldn’t be the new Seven Sword Deities; they were all too inexperienced, including himself. It had to be from the previous generation.</p><p>“Master Siren is impossible.”</p><p>“Elder You Tu disappeared without a trace, presumed dead, he’s likely gone…”</p><p>“Gou Wuyue at best is a demi-saint, and Rao Yaoyao was killed by me.”</p><p>“Feng Tingchen is unclear, but he shouldn’t be so arrogant. Tall trees catch the wind, he should understand…”</p><p>Who else remained?</p><p>Jin Ren’s mind briefly short-circuited, feeling like he had exhausted all the possibilities of the Seven Sword Deities.</p><p>Li Fugui seemed to share this sentiment. Finally, he raised his eyes and slapped his head, “Sword Deity Wen?”</p><p>Oh right, there was Wen Ting… Jin Ren remembered this person, but his impression was not deep.</p><p>“Sword Deity Wen, unlikely, right?” Li Fugui was skeptical. “He, after all, has hardly any presence…”</p><p>Jin Ren’s expression froze upon hearing this.</p><p>If they were talking about lack of presence, about being “forgotten,” besides Wen Ting, there was another guy:</p><p>Hua Changdeng!</p><p>Whether it was Jin Ren or his true self, their understanding of both Hua Changdeng and Wen Ting was similar—vague and incomplete.</p><p>Apart from knowing that he specialized in the Phantom Swords Technique, everything else was a mystery.</p><p>But!</p><p>This guy was the lifelong enemy of Bazhun’an.</p><p>At least, regardless of the process, the injuries on Eighth’s neck and the two severed fingers were all thanks to him.</p><p>“Hua…”</p><p>Li Fugui also seemed to catch on to something, his voice becoming heavy. “Yue Bei Hua Rao Dao?”</p><p>That was the most likely scenario!</p><p>And it would make sense if it was Hua Changdeng.</p><p>He wouldn’t even be deliberately suppressed by other Holy Emperors because he’s originally from one of the Five Great Holy Emperor aristocratic families, a smooth path all along.</p><p>“No wonder it’s bad news…”</p><p>Jin Ren sneered softly, feeling agitated.</p><p>His breakthrough speed was already fast enough, yet the geniuses on this continent still managed to keep up, even surpassing him.</p><p>Who was cheating here?</p><p>“Enough of those thoughts.”</p><p>Discarding the unpleasant matters, it was up to the Holy Emperor to deal with the Holy Emperor, and if Hua Changdeng really became the Holy Emperor, it would be his opponent, Bazhun’an, who would have a headache.</p><p>Jin Ren looked at Li Fugui and returned to the matter at hand. “What happened to Aunt Xiang?”</p><p>Li Fugui quickly gathered his thoughts, recounting everything that had happened after Lord Shou fell unconscious.</p><p>Including what he witnessed in Jade Capital City, where Hallmaster Dao personally intervened, destroying Yougui Pavilion and capturing Aunt Xiang.</p><p>As well as the Wangze Holy Emperor’s attempt to kill the demi-saint Ye Xiaotian with a single finger, prompting Ye Xiaotian to seek refuge in the Four Symbols Secret Realm, alarming the Holy Emperor Bai Long.</p><p>Jin Ren listened quietly, sinking into silence.</p><p>All these events escalated to the level of demi-saints and Holy Emperors. What could a mere portrait clone like him do?</p><p>And why would Rao Wangze attack Ye Xiaotian?</p><p>Shouldn’t his hatred be directed towards him? Attacking Ye Xiaotian was like scratching an itch through a boot.</p><p>No!</p><p>It was even more pointless!</p><p>Li Fugui didn’t consider these thoughts. After detailing everything, he informed Lord Shou of the purpose of his visit:</p><p>“After spending some time at Yougui Pavilion, I managed to meet Aunt Xiang secretly and left a means of contact.”</p><p>“She should be in dire straits now, otherwise, she wouldn’t have contacted me, a completely unreliable carriage driver whose identity is barely revealed.”</p><p>“In other words, if Lord Shou doesn’t take action…” Li Fugui hesitated.</p><p>“Aunt Xiang will die?” Jin Ren finished his sentence.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Li Fugui said solemnly, “As long as The Divine doesn’t die, Aunt Xiang won’t die!”</p><p>“Why would I need to intervene then?” Jin Ren smiled. “Aunt Xiang has someone to protect her, I’m not her man.”</p><p>Li Fugui hesitated to speak, unsure if Lord Shou was feigning ignorance or genuinely clueless.</p><p>“Speak,” Jin Ren suppressed his smile.</p><p>“Lord Shou should know that as long as Aunt Xiang is captured, it’s equivalent to capturing The Divine. With Hallmaster Dao’s methods, The Divine will probably never escape again.”</p><p>So, the Saint Servant lost a major force in battle? Jin Ren nodded silently.</p><p>“That’s not the worst outcome. The worst is if The Divine is used by the Holy Divine Palace…”</p><p>Jin Ren was taken aback. This hadn’t occurred to him.</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao has the Divine Secret Technique but lacks the most powerful research subject…”</p><p>“The Bei family of the Holy Emperors has the ghost beasts but lacks the most formidable ghost beast host body…”</p><p>Li Fugui’s logic was clear, but his words weighed heavily:</p><p>“Whether actively or passively.”</p><p>“When The Divine falls into Hallmaster Dao’s hands, it would be best if he’s out of the game. If he re-enters, he might become our enemy.”</p><p>“Even without resorting to those methods, if I were Hallmaster Dao, all I’d need to do is attack his mind to take down The Divine.”</p><p>“By then, except for not being able to go all out against Bazhun’an, The Divine will be a threat to anyone else.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
