Behind the First Pavilion in the Sky is… There are many Saint beasts like you inside!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou continued coolly. “You should have heard of the Third Ancestor of the White Vein and the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, right?”</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin didn’t say much, but its eyes flickered with a strange emotion.</p><p>“Woo…”</p><p>With a mournful sound, a blast of cold wind with a power that did not seem to belong to this world swept through the space.</p><p>Perhaps it was one of the reasons why the Qilin was sealed?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was overjoyed when he saw the Holy Emperor Qilin nod.</p><p>There were several ways to approach this complex situation. Purely using words was meaningless. He tried to use his persuasion skills again.</p><p>“They are one of our powers!”</p><p>“The First Pavilion in the Sky is here to overthrow the Holy Divine Palace and the rule of the Holy Emperor aristocratic family. What they want is to release warriors like you with the strongest combat strength.”</p><p>“If our goal is achieved, we will change the world’s structure and geniuses would no longer be restricted!”</p><p>The more Xu Xiaoshou spoke, the more excited he became. The Berserk Giant’s hands drew big circles on the shattered void.</p><p>“At that time, the demi-saints won’t have to lock themselves up in a corner, and the Holy Emperor won’t be able to deceive the masses.”</p><p>“Senior, there’s no need to hide in this small Four Symbols Secret Realm. The world is huge, you can go anywhere!”</p><p>“So, Senior Qilin, why don’t you give yourself a chance to cooperate with the First Pavilion in the Sky?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou spoke so passionately that even he was touched.</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin seemed to have taken it to heart and was equally touched.</p><p>Its huge dark blue eyes trembled, and black tears flowed out of its eye sockets.</p><p>Black tears rolled down the trail of black tear stains underneath the Qilin’s eyes like a waterfall into the black fog. They flowed out of the broken world and headed to an unknown place.</p><p>“Woo…”</p><p>The wails in the void became even louder as they were completely influenced by the emotions of the Holy Emperor’s power.</p><p>“Human…” The Qilin responded and called out in a sorrowful voice.</p><p>“How is it? Isn’t that a good suggestion?”</p><p>Tears welled up Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes. He wiped away his tears and was about to shake hands with the Holy Emperor Qilin and become good friends.</p><p>He suddenly froze on the spot.</p><p>I’m a freaking Berserk Giant!</p><p>The Berserk Giant was so tough and fierce, how could it shed tears? Even if I bled, it would be impossible for me to shed tears!</p><p>“+( Affected. Passive Points),+1.”</p><p>The Information Bar kept popping up.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou scrolled through the messages. Similar ‘affected’ messages had actually appeared for a long time.</p><p>However, that was a reminder from the moment they entered this shattered world.</p><p>It was normal for the Holy Emperor’s power to affect the surroundings.</p><p>It was normal for the Qilin’s emotions to affect the transformation in this world.</p><p>It was normal for the Spirit Awakening to be triggered repeatedly!</p><p>The only abnormal thing was…</p><p>“Wuwuwu…”</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin’s tears after being touched by his speech turned into tears of sorrow. It raised its claws and covered its face as it cried. It didn’t care about its image as it sobbed.</p><p>“Don’t say anymore, wu…”</p><p>“Don’t say anymore. Sob, sob, I’m sorry…”</p><p>The Berserk Giant also burst into tears as the two giant beasts seemed to be on the same emotional channel.</p><p>“Don’t cry, sob sob…”</p><p>“You made me cry too. I’m, I’m sorry. I really deserve to die…”</p><p>What the heck am I doing?</p><p>Why should I apologize?</p><p>No! No!</p><p>Why am I crying?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cried even as he watched in horror when the Holy Emperor Qilin turned into a crying Qilin</p><p>The black tears that flowed down converged and formed a sea. They drowned this shattered world and it resembled an enlarged version of the Black Water Stream.</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>Black Water Stream?</p><p>The black water there, could it be…</p><p>When the sadness turned into a river, his thoughts were already intermittent and unconnected.</p><p>Suddenly, a deep voice came from afar.</p><p>“It gave you a chance.”</p><p>“You should have run long ago.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
