He would imitate certain actions after learning them and leave the suspicion to others.</p><p>The communication bead drew a beautiful parabola in the sky and accurately shot toward the Holy Emperor Qilin’s mouth. It tried to force its way through the gap between its teeth and then deceive itself into thinking that taking it down was acceptance.</p><p>However, the Holy Emperor Qilin didn’t do anything. After getting close to the Qilin, the communication bead seemed to increase in gravity and quickly fell to the ground.</p><p>“Thud.”</p><p>It landed on the ground with a soft sound.</p><p>The communication bead shattered cleanly.</p><p>Gong Yang Mountain suddenly fell silent.</p><p>The atmosphere froze a little. Xu Xiaoshou didn’t think it was awkward. As long as he was not embarrassed, any awkwardness belonged to…Uh, the communication bead.</p><p>Fifteen minutes?</p><p>Bei Huai really did not know if this was just a random lie or if Xu Xiaoshou had just extended the time.</p><p>What he cared about was whether Bazhun’an would arrive within fifteen minutes.</p><p>However, that was Dao Qiongcang’s matter and had nothing to do with him.</p><p>Bei Huai did not have the slightest desire to face or take down Bazhun’an. That person was not a ghost beast.</p><p>In fact, if it weren’t for Xu Xiaoshou’s actions, he wouldn’t even have to face The Divine, let alone possess the Holy Emperor Qilin.</p><p>At this moment, how could he possibly contribute to Dao Qiongcang? This Elder Dao even schemed against him…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Holy Emperor five elements shattered the temporary silence and caused space to shatter once more.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t want to hand over Greedy the Cat Spirit, so Bei Huai had to do it himself.</p><p>He did not even need to banish space. The Holy Emperor Qilin’s claw moved, and the Four Symbols Seal loosened a little.</p><p>Azure Dragon’s Wood, White Tiger’s Gold, Vermillion Bird’s Fire, Black Tortoise’s Water, and Qilin’s Earth fused and formed a claw that emitted a dazzling five-colored light that suppressed down.</p><p>The Path Principles shattered, and spacetime became chaotic.</p><p>Even a demi-saint couldn’t hide from this attack, let alone Xu Xiaoshou, who was only at the Sovereign Stage.</p><p>“Locked-on. Passive points +1.”</p><p>“Affected. Passive points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes woke up, and his eyes were filled with vigor. He had activated his Moment of Enlightenment and forcefully increased his reaction speed.</p><p>The Qilin’s claw was a great threat!</p><p>Only the “sneak attack” message that should have appeared as a notification did not appear.</p><p>This meant that Xu Xiaoshou could keep up with the Holy Emperor Qilin’s attack.</p><p>“Why bother…”</p><p>“Why force me to attack?”</p><p>Sighing, Xu Xiaoshou no longer held back. His body towered, no longer resembling that of a human.</p><p>It would be very stressful to face the Ten High Nobles alone.</p><p>“Berserk Giant!”</p><p>In an instant, golden light broke through the sky.</p><p>Just like in the broken world, the violent giant that climbed the mountain with the Qilin appeared.</p><p>Facing the Qilin’s claw, the berserk giant didn’t retreat. Instead, he attacked and punched at the five-colored light.</p><p>When the two powers intersected, his Moment of Enlightenment seemed to be unable to hold on any longer. The spirit source in the Berserk Giant’s body was already depleted.</p><p>However, at this moment, a huge blood-red Taotie Beast Head suddenly appeared behind the giant.</p><p>“Feast!”</p><p>Gulp.</p><p>One bite!</p><p>n fact, regardless of whether he could convert the power of a Holy Emperor or not, Xu Xiaoshou only tried to devour it with his life. He had already been forced to die.</p><p>The Qilin’s claw lost its sharpness after losing the invisible colorful light.</p><p>All the attacks in the form of energy were devoured in one gulp and returned to the Berserk Giant’s body.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The five elements were gone.</p><p>However, the Qilin’s claw still slammed into the Berserk Giant’s fist.</p><p>Without a doubt, the passive skill could not withstand the might of a Holy Emperor, even if the power of the five elements was completely exhausted and the Qilin was weak.</p><p>The Berserk Giant’s body bulged, and dense wounds appeared all over its body. Energy crazily leaked out, like a huge ruptured balloon.</p><p>Just as his right arm was about to shatter and turn into dust, the space and Path Principles were like charred leaves that fluttered in the wind.</p><p>“Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand!”</p><p>The high-level power of the Penetrating Divine Senses barely managed to protect one of the Berserk Giant’s arms. At the same time, the fist wind blasted over.</p><p>Scorching intent entered the Holy Emperor Qilin’s front claws and ravaged its veins, causing the Qilin’s eyes to narrow.</p><p>But…</p><p>Too weak!</p><p>This was still too weak!</p><p>After all, regardless of whether he was in a demi-saint body, it was still the Penetrating Divine Senses of a Sovereign Dao Realm expert.</p><p>No matter how weak the Holy Emperor Qilin was, it was still an ancient sacred beast. Even without using the recovery power of the Azure Dragon’s wood element, it could temporarily stabilize the attack.</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>The Berserk Giant opened its mouth and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>However, just as the blood was about to burst out of his body, it evaporated.</p><p>He couldn’t hold on any longer!</p><p>The power of the Holy Emperor in his body was too vast!</p><p>It was impossible to digest the power of the Holy Emperor’s five elements in an instant with just ‘conversion’.</p><p>Just as Xu Xiaoshou felt the intense pain that was about to explode, the Dragon Pearl in his chest slowly woke up. It intercepted and stored most of the power that could not be converted for the time being, and then released it with a backhand.</p><p>This was Xu Xiaoshou’s plan!</p><p>His opponent’s strength was his achievement!</p><p>The Berserk Giant’s eyes were filled with a fierce light. At this moment, the energy stored in the Dragon Pearl was filled again.</p><p>In this way, Xu Xiaoshou had the strength to open his Moment of Enlightenment for the second time.</p><p>He immediately raised his head in anger, and his voice was like thunder. His power followed his voice and reached beyond the clouds.</p><p>“Ultimate! Giant!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin’s deep blue eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>Whether it was Bei Huai or the Qilin, this was the first time they had seen something beyond their own size. It was even more exaggerated than the void attendant.</p><p>The golden giant suddenly disappeared.</p><p>In front of the Holy Emperor Qilin’s front claw, his sight was suddenly filled with a huge bone that was emitting steam.</p><p>Bei Huai studied the human body and ghost beasts.</p><p>Of course, he could tell that it was a kneecap.</p><p>A human’s…</p><p>No, a giant’s?</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin looked up and realized that it was not an illusion.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s Berserk Giant had evolved for the second time!</p><p>And this time, even if he stood, the Holy Emperor Qilin could only reach his knees!</p><p>“Abyss Clan bloodline? It doesn’t look like…”</p><p>“Ancient Martial Arts Six Paths? No…”</p><p>“Heaven, Ancestor?”</p><p>Bei Huai had been acknowledged by the will of the Heavenly Ancestor, and he had studied the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy.</p><p>He realized that this did not seem to correspond to the power that Xu Xiaoshou was displaying at this moment.</p><p>This was a brand-new form of power!</p><p>In an instant, even Bei Huai fell into a temporary state of confusion.</p><p>“Who is Xu Xiaoshou exactly?”</p><p>“Ha…”</p><p>The Ultimate Giant exhaled.</p><p>The scorching breath swept across the sky and swept across half of the Qilin’s World, melting the soft clouds.</p><p>A strange burning rain fell from heaven and earth.</p><p>The rain stopped halfway.</p><p>The rain evaporated into steam and rose again.</p><p>The clouds gathered, turned into rain, and then turned into steam, repeating the cycle.</p><p>The Qilin Realm fell into a strange cycle.</p><p>This strange phenomenon caused all of the Spiritual Cultivators in the Qilin’s Realm to look up in shock.</p><p>However, when they looked over, it was difficult for them to see what had appeared in the direction of Gong Yang Mountain.</p><p>Through the distorted space, they could only see a tall, blurry shadow that looked like a giant leaning over.</p><p>“What is that?”</p><p>“A giant?”</p><p>‘Giant’ could not even be used to describe this monster!</p><p>This thing was so big. With just one punch, could it shatter half of the Qilin World?</p><p>A small number of people, who had personally experienced the chaos at Gong Yang Mountain but managed to escape in time under the Holy Emperor’s power of Bei Huai, could vaguely sense who this strange phenomenon was.</p><p>In that place, even the mice have vanished, leaving only two of them!</p><p>The heartbroken Holy Emperor was last seen parasitizing the Holy Emperor Qilin. This giant couldn’t possibly be him.</p><p>The Divine was also gone, moreover, the Human Realm Dao and Hungry Ghost Path did not come in this form, so it could not be him.</p><p>As such, even if the remaining deduction was impossible, it could only be that person…</p><p>“That Saint Servant…Lord Shou?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
