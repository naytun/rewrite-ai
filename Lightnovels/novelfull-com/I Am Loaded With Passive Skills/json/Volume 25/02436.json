Even if he died under the power of the five elements and five symbols, he is just an incarnation.”</p><p>“Why was Xu Xiaoshou so fearless?”</p><p>From the conversation between the two of them, Xu Xiaoshou had never come into contact with the complete ancient martial arts of the Six Paths before.</p><p>Even The Divine, who was part of the Ten High Nobles, had to spend a lot of time and effort to cultivate the Six Paths, and he was still the number one ancient martial artiste in the world.</p><p>Because of his faith in the Ten High Nobles, Bei Huai did not believe that Xu Xiaoshou could comprehend the Human Realm Dao with just a glance.</p><p>The threshold of the ancient martial arts was so high that it was beyond an ordinary person’s imagination!</p><p>Not to mention the ultimate Six Paths?</p><p>The Divine did not pause for long and did not give Bei Huai much time to think.</p><p>After he understood Xu Xiaoshou’s learning and absorption progress, he did not even consider the question of whether it was true or not. He trusted him unconditionally.</p><p>“At the Gates of Hell!”</p><p>He turned around and shouted. The sinister aura of the Nine Heavens gathered, and time and space became chaotic.</p><p>The greyish-black, evil, and ancient giant door descended from the sky and dropped between the holy land Qilin and The Divine with great force.</p><p>“Here it comes…”</p><p>When he saw that the main event was about to occur, the Body Dao Disc under Xu Xiaoshou’s feet changed into the Spirit Dao Disc.</p><p>He carefully observed the At the Gates of Hell that covered the sky and felt that something was different.</p><p>This thing was like the separation of Yin and Yang and it opened the door to hell. People entered through this door, and ghosts exited through this door.</p><p>The Divine spoke hurriedly as he knew that he didn’t have much time. He quickly told him the prerequisites to activate the Hungry Ghost Path, that was one of the Six Paths.</p><p>“To open the Hungry Ghost Path, you must first summon the At the Gates of Hell.”</p><p>“To summon the At the Gates of Hell, one must first sign a soul contract and allow one’s soul to be connected to the netherworld. Through this, one can open the door for the exchange of spirit meat.”</p><p>“How do I sign a soul contract?” Xu Xiaoshou was slightly startled.</p><p>“According to the ancient book, after you find the gates of hell, you will encounter the envoy and kill your way into the Yin Cao netherworld… As long as you can find the ‘key’ to the underworld in the human world, you can follow the clues and use the small leads to obtain the big stuff. To sign a soul contract would then be a piece of cake.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was still a little confused.</p><p>The problem was that he was in the Yang realm and usually could not come into contact with these things. There really was an underworld?</p><p>“What about you? How did you sign it?” He asked hurriedly.</p><p>“It was through an insight.” The Divine didn’t even turn his head. “One day, I had an insight. I was shocked to realize that my soul could leave my body. I learned the Six Paths ghost technique without a teacher.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cursed in his heart.</p><p>This really did not leave any way out for mortals.</p><p>To be able to comprehend the same thing by relying on insight and coincidentally have his soul leave his body, this probability… How long would it take?</p><p>“Is there any other practical method? Your insight method is too high-handed…”</p><p>“I’ve already mentioned the three methods.”</p><p>“If those three methods were not that high-handed, I won’t go so far as to ask you how you comprehended them!” Xu Xiaoshou was so anxious that he wanted to hit someone.</p><p>The Divine seemed to be stunned.</p><p>But soon, he nodded.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>“How?”</p><p>“When you master the Hell Path and open the gates of hell, it can summon the At the Gates of Hell. It’s as easy as taking something out of your pocket!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had a bad feeling. “Then, how do I master the Hell Path?”</p><p>“Master the Hungry Ghost Path.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt numb.</p><p>He couldn’t even tell if The Divine was joking or being serious at this solemn moment.</p><p>Wasn’t this an endless loop?</p><p>However, this time, The Divine turned around. His expression seemed to ask “Why are we entangled in such a simple entry-level issue?”</p><p>Without any preparation…</p><p>The Divine grabbed the Soul Holy Medicine in his hand, swallowed it, then jumped into the At the Gates of Hell.</p><p>At the same time, thunder rumbled in Xu Xiaoshou’s mind.</p><p>“The spirit meat is both virtual and real.”</p><p>“A person’s thought is born from the soul and can control the body…”</p><p>“If a person’s thought is placed on the physical body, it will control the soul…”</p><p>“This Dao is the transformation between reality and illusion!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stepped on the Spirit Dao Disc and didn’t dare to delay any longer. He entered the Unity of Man and the Heavens.</p><p>The theory about the spirit meat was indeed promising. It was similar to the Three Streams of Red Plum Blossoms in the Falling Flower World taught by Master Siren.</p><p>However, that sword move was to transform the world of ideas and the real world into reality.</p><p>The Hungry Ghost Path was about the body and soul?</p><p>How then was he supposed to convert it?</p><p>As he thought about this, after the huge door closed, the human The Divine disappeared and the Hungry Ghost swooped over. It was as big as the Holy Emperor Qilin.</p><p>In his mind, the thunder never stopped rumbling.</p><p>“Ancient martial arts cultivation is not a cultivation of the body.”</p><p>“If you cultivate it into an actual thing, it is called flesh. If you cultivate emptiness, it is called spirit.”</p><p>“The spiritual and physical strength of spirit meat can be changed with a single thought. Emptiness can be filled, and reality can be hidden.”</p><p>What was this?</p><p>This was too complicated!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t understand a single word, but the voice in his mind didn’t stop. He could only force himself to focus and memorize it.</p><p>“Hungry Ghost Path, eat ten thousand spirits, devour ten thousand methods.”</p><p>“Spiritual spells are all empty, three thousand digested and transformed into reality, all that’s left is the reverse.”</p><p>“When you face the At the Gates of Hell, the true and false are reversed. When Yin and Yang are connected, the spirit meat can be reversed.”</p><p>One sentence after another.</p><p>The obscure incantation was even bigger than the Heaven Secrets spiritual array. It was all crammed into Xu Xiaoshou’s mind.</p><p>As he stepped on the Spirit Dao Disc, Xu Xiaoshou quickly absorbed and tried to digest it, but to no avail.</p><p>When he saw the Hungry Ghost The Divine come out of the At the Gates of Hell, the light on his body flowed about and the path energy was formed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
