Red light flickered above it, implying an ominous omen.</p><p>He looked up at the sky.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s saint calamity was already in its final stages, so it should not be a problem for him to transcend it.</p><p>However, the guidance on the Divine Array Wheel made Xuan Wuji feel slightly uneasy.</p><p>What went wrong?</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Xuan Wuji frowned.</p><p>“Everything went too smoothly…”</p><p>“How could Elder Dao have possibly set up a trap in the Four Symbols Secret Realm in advance and let Xu Xiaoshou break through successfully?”</p><p>“This match doesn’t look like it’s over. On the contrary, it’s just the beginning…”</p><p>“But if this is only the beginning, how should I proceed?”</p><p>This was different from the battle on Abyss Island.</p><p>At that time, all the plans had been discussed in advance, and everything had come to an end in an orderly manner.</p><p>Xuan Wuji contributed to the two most crucial points, the Divine Array that connected the deep sea to Abyss Island, and the formation of the Four Divine Pillars that could draw on the power of Holy Emperors.</p><p>Even if there were twists and turns in the middle, it was because Lord Shou was too strong that the plan went smoothly.</p><p>Even Dao Qiongcang was unable to turn things around!</p><p>At that time, it would be the most glorious moment for a Divine Sorcerer. He would be planning behind the scenes, not showing his face for the entire game, yet his influence can be felt throughout the whole situation</p><p>Now that he had come to the Shengshen Continent, what Xuan Wuji had to face was Dao Qiongcang’s situation.</p><p>He experienced the discomfort that Dao Qiongcang might have felt at that time.</p><p>He was like the Holy Divine Palace on Abyss Island. He could barely figure out what was going on, but he also felt like he was being led by the nose.</p><p>So…</p><p>If everything went too smoothly, it would be abnormal.</p><p>“Don’t be afraid. I have an array wheel. As long as no Holy Emperors come, I can protect myself.”</p><p>Xuan Wuji patted his chest to console himself.</p><p>For this, he had prepared many Divine Array Wheels in advance.</p><p>This was an extremely extravagant preparation for the war. It had emptied all of Liu Changqing’s inventory and favors.</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>The raging saint calamity in the Nine Heavens had reached its final stage, and Ye Xiaotian was completely submerged.</p><p>Perhaps in less than ten breaths, the Shengshen Continent would have another demi-saint.</p><p>“With a demi-saint of Spatial Upanishad as my chess piece, I can go anywhere in the world,” Xuan Wuji smiled.</p><p>At this moment, the jade communication talisman on the necklace he was wearing flashed with a red light. It was from the Flower Pavilion and only a short message was sent.</p><p>“Jade Capital City, Xiang Yaoyao, is in danger!”</p><p>Xuan Wuji raised his eyebrows.</p><p>When Lord Shou was fighting here, the other in the Jade Capital was captured?</p><p>Of course, Xuan Wuji knew about Aunt Xiang.</p><p>After leaving Abyss Island, he remembered the latest situation in the world.</p><p>Not only Aunt Xiang, he also knew about The Divine and could deduce the origin of The Divine’s Virtual Image.</p><p>From this, he could deduce the fact that Aunt Xiang had entered the Four Symbols Secret Realm with Lord Shou.</p><p>This was not difficult to deduce.</p><p>Through the Divine Secret’s energy movement technique, he could instantly find out the truth.</p><p>Since he knew all of this, Dao Qiongcang could naturally deduce it as well.</p><p>“Then the ‘danger’ of the Jade Capital is the highest level of ‘danger.’ It’s possible that Dao Qiongcang has decided to personally take action.”</p><p>“After all, Aunt Xiang was one of the Ten High Nobles…”</p><p>“Hmm, I should say that if we don’t handle it well, it’s easy to provoke The Divine. That’s the most dangerous situation. If we leave it to someone else, if I’m that Elder Dao, I won’t be at ease either…”</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>A faint holy light suddenly rippled in the air, creating spatial ripples.</p><p>The sky of the Central Yuan world that had been shattered by the battle between Holy Emperors recovered at a speed visible to the naked eye after the holy light swept past.</p><p>It was not just the sky of the Central Yuan world, but the countless shattered spaces below. Even the battlefield of the Qilin Realm that had yet to completely recover.</p><p>After the holy light swept past, the sky was clear and the space was as good as new.</p><p>“A demi-sain!”</p><p>The people of the two worlds heard the sound of the Saint Language and did not know what it meant.</p><p>When he raised his head, he could see through the mountains and clouds and see an extremely distant blurry figure that seemed to be close at hand.</p><p>At this moment, everyone knew that there was another demi-saint in the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>It was Ye Xiaotian, the demi-saint of Spatial Upanishad!</p><p>“Very good. I’ve succeeded in becoming a saint. I only need to erase all traces of this place. Then, I’ll be able to ride him to the Jade Capital as quickly as possible…”</p><p>Xuan Wuji made a seal with his hands, and the surrounding void erased the traces of his existence to prevent Elder Dao from recalling it.</p><p>At the same time, Ye Xiaotian, who had just become a demi-saint cultivator, let out a long howl in mid-air and felt that his vitality and vigor had been fully restored.</p><p>“Finally…”</p><p>“An Upanishad demi-saint!”</p><p>He suppressed his excitement and was about to stabilize his cultivation when a voice sounded in his ears.</p><p>“Consolidating your realm. After that, follow me to the Jade Capital. We still have something to do.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s expression froze as he instinctively resisted.</p><p>However, he soon sighed and thought to himself, Forget it. I’ll just treat this as the last time I’ll help that kid after becoming a demi-saint. After all, they’re all part of Saint Servant.</p><p>The power of Spatial Upanishad disappeared in the sky.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian only needed to conceal himself slightly, and it was as if he had been erased from this world. Furthermore, this was just a small application of the Spatial Path.</p><p>He sat cross-legged in the air and looked at his energy reserve.</p><p>The spiritual source in his energy reserve was turning into Holy Power, setting off endless waves.</p><p>After these changes calmed down, his spiritual source would also turn into Holy Power. His demi-saint realm would be considered stable and he could attack normally.</p><p>“Oh right, there’s also this…”</p><p>There was still a spatial passageway that couldn’t be restored to its original state even when he became a demi-saint.</p><p>This was the remnant of the peak power from Bei Huai’s Soul Sacrifice.</p><p>The power of a Holy Emperor was too powerful!</p><p>Even if it was an ownerless spiritual technique, when the saint calamity strikes at it till the end, it would only be riddled with holes and shattered. It was not completely destroyed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
