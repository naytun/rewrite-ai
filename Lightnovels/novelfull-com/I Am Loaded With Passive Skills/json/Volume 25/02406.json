Tears flowed again. “I’m sorry. I didn’t hear you clearly. My hearing is bad…”</p><p>“Human, I’m sorry. I should have been honest with you. I’ve long been unable to maintain myself…”</p><p>“I’m sorry. I should be the one to apologize. I shouldn’t have forced you to leave with me, but I still want to say… It’s really funny how we hugged and confessed to each other.”</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>The Qilin’s sorrow was temporarily suppressed.</p><p>This human was too much!</p><p>He was able to maintain his consciousness even with Bei Huai’s ability and was not affected by his emotions?</p><p>With just a glance, the Qilin’s thoughts were cut off again. Black tears fell like a waterfall. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have suspected you…”</p><p>The Berserk Giant that clung to its body was showered with copious tears and snot. How could he not be affected by its emotions?</p><p>Perhaps these hypocritical humans were all like this. Even their confessions seemed to be faked?</p><p>On the other hand, Xu Xiaoshou cried and broke out in cold sweat at the same time.</p><p>Bei Huai!</p><p>Holy Emperor Bei Huai!</p><p>Bei Huai, the Bei Huai of ‘Even if Bei Huai did not cry, the Heavens will be hurt’!</p><p>When the voice emerged and the power that made people lose control of their emotions appeared, Xu Xiaoshou had already guessed the identity of the person.</p><p>He still remembered that on Abyss Island, this was one of the few people that Bazhun’an acknowledged. He was definitely Holy Emperor material among the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>“The Ten High Nobles, Holy Emperor, Bei…”</p><p>When these three terms were combined, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to imagine how terrifying this person was!</p><p>He cursed Bazhun’an in his heart and cursed all of Dao Qiongcang’s eighteen generations of ancestors, but it was difficult to vent his anger.</p><p>“D*mn this bullshit ‘Qilin’ mission!”</p><p>“The Qilin is already Bei Huai’s possession. Why the f*ck did I foolishly rush right under its nose and tried time and again to persuade it?!”</p><p>“I feel like a fool!”</p><p>The Qilin’s guess was right. Xu Xiaoshou had self-control.</p><p>His first attack was indeed controlled by Bei Huai, but it was only the first attack.</p><p>After his emotions fluctuated to the point that he triggered the Spirit Awakening, he immediately directed his thoughts into the second true body at the Ran Ming ruins.</p><p>This was the only way he could maintain his will under Bei Huai’s watch.</p><p>The price was that someone else would cry…</p><p>That’s right, the one who cried and hugged the Qilin was Jin Ren!</p><p>From the way that his original body and his second true body were connected but independent of each other, Xu Xiaoshou could already see how abnormal Bei Huai’s ability was from the third person’s perspective!</p><p>Jin Ren had completely lost his ability to think normally and only felt immense remorse.</p><p>He couldn’t even come up with a battle plan for himself, such as whether to run or stay. All he could do was to repeatedly say ‘I’m sorry’.</p><p>Holy Emperor Bei Huai had only just entered the scene. If he didn’t have a second true body, Xu Xiaoshou knew that he would be affected too.</p><p>His current state of mind was like he had just left the novice village and was strolling on the road to play. Then he encountered a monster that he saw in the ultimate trial that had suddenly fallen from the sky.</p><p>“I can’t be chaotic!”</p><p>“I definitely can’t panic!”</p><p>“Isn’t it just a Holy Emperor? I’ve seen too many of them. I’ve even beaten up one of them!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was inside the Ran Ming ruins forced himself to calm down.</p><p>The more dangerous the moment, the more one needed to stay calm and collected..</p><p>His thoughts were like lightning that split into countless branches in an instant.</p><p>“First of all, Bei Huai’s ability can’t affect the Ran Ming ruins. There’s no doubt about it. The god slayer Ran Ming is at the level of the Ten Ancestors. The Holy Emperor Bei Huai is nothing. He’s only a high-level Holy Emperor…”</p><p>“Holy f*ck, high-level Holy Emperor? How do I fight with him? How could a Holy Emperor’s ability be like this? It was so abnormal… Calm down, calm down, Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>You’re Xu Xiaoshou! Keep thinking!”</p><p>“Secondly, Bazhun’an probably was not aware that the Qilin had been captured by Bei Huai. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have sent me here to investigate. My life is too important after all.”</p><p>“F*ck! Even Bazhun’an was unaware of the situation? He had also been forsaken by the Holy Emperor’s power of guidance? How was he supposed to fight?”</p><p>“Calm down, I have to calm down… It’s just another obstacle. Amitabha, Buddha, quick give me a solution to this problem…”</p><p>“Yes, solve the problem. We can’t mess things up!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was used to talking to Jin Ren on a daily basis.</p><p>Therefore, even though Jin Ren was crying, his will seemed to have split into two and they began to refute each other and tried to find a way to survive.</p><p>“In the worst case, even if I die, I can call out to Ran Ming and connect to the ruins. This would be my last resort. God slayer! You’re such a good person! Your ruins appeared in such a timely manner!”</p><p>“Calm down Xu Xiaoshou. Have you thought about this problem? You can enter, but how about when you come out. If you are in the same place after you came out, then as long as Bei Huai doesn’t enter the Ran Ming ruins, will he have more time to prepare and take you down?”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>“This is a problem of space allocation. Where you come from and where you go, you only need the mark of a space node. However, gathering people from different places in the world through the Ran Ming ruins will eventually lead to the same place. It will take more effort. This will even involve some rules of the secret land that would cause the teleportation to fail. It’s a thankless effort.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that honest advice was unpleasant to the ear, but it was beneficial to practice.</p><p>At this point, he was 90% sure that all the people who shouted ‘Ran Ming’ and entered the ruins had a high chance to return to their original positions if they could come out alive.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
