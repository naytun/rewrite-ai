It was also likely that it had crossed the Holy Palace or cooperated with the Holy Palace. It was not important anymore.</p><p>What was most important was that the Holy Emperor Qilin had long been captured by them!</p><p>The Saint Servant were short of manpower.</p><p>As a result, even if he hoped for a fluke, he would find time to interact with the Holy Emperor Qilin after he learned about its situation.</p><p>This game was not even considered a conspiracy. At most, some people would do anything even if it led to a loss and those who were willing took the bait.</p><p>Even if no one took the bait in the end, the Holy Divine Palace would not suffer any losses. The Holy Palace would continue to draw on the Qilin’s power.</p><p>Thus, they were not in a hurry.</p><p>However, the Saint Servant was anxious and as a result, he had less to consider.</p><p>As for the Holy Emperor level, unlike those ghost beasts on the Inner Island of the Abyss Island, Bazhun’an had more contacts.</p><p>A large number of details related to this matter were ignored by everyone.</p><p>In addition, Dao Qiongcang had also compressed the time of the Holy Palace trial, which was too fatal. Xu Xiaoshou’s step-by-step plan had failed.</p><p>He wanted to give it a try in advance and leave the main event to the Ran Ming ruins ten days later.</p><p>In the early operation, his main body did not even have to come out. He could use Jin Ren to probe into the Holy Emperor Qilin’s strength. If he died, then so be it. Xu Xiaoshou had already considered the pros and cons.</p><p>Now, he was forced to combine the two attempts into one. The time difference between the Ran Ming ruins and the holy land Qilin had been ruthlessly eliminated, and the two were intertwined together. Xu Xiaoshou could not split himself up, so he could only fight with his own body.</p><p>This rhythm was completely messed up.</p><p>Once the rhythm was messed up, his thoughts became even more limited.</p><p>The faster he wanted to get it, the easier it would be for him to take Dao Qiongcang’s bait; that would be unwise.</p><p>“Traitor!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked and angry.</p><p>When the Ran Ming ruins opened early, he could not see anything. Now that he thought about it, Dao Qiongcang was simply a traitor, a rebel and an evil thief!</p><p>As for what Bei Huai had said…</p><p>At first, Xu Xiaoshou really thought that he was talking about himself, but the more he listened, the more he felt that it was unlikely.</p><p>In addition, Bei Huai had told him that he was not here for him.</p><p>“Could it be that there’s a parallel universe that had an existence similar to me and Bei Huai took a fancy to him?”</p><p>“The one he said about walking into a trap is not me, but…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t keep his hopes up for long, and he came up with a terrifying conclusion.</p><p>It wasn’t him.</p><p>However, it could be an item, something, or… a certain existence!</p><p>If ‘it’ had followed him long ago, it would indeed have been able to experience the White Cave, Dongtianwang City, the Yunlun Mountain Range, and even Abyss Island.</p><p>He was also connected to the Xu Yue Grey Palace…</p><p>“Meow?”</p><p>In the Apricot Realm, Greedy the Cat Spirit crossed its front paws and looked up at the sky from the edge of the ancient alchemy cauldron. It called out in a daze.</p><p>The sky of the Apricot Realm suddenly shook…</p><p>This was not something rare.</p><p>The world here had even undergone an evolution and changed with each passing day. It was normal for it to shake from time to time.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit’s gaze quickly returned to its new alchemy cauldron.</p><p>The old alchemy cauldron had been destroyed by its owner when he experimented with a new move after the Apricot Realm had transformed.</p><p>These were from the Dragon Apricot Spirit’s inventory and it had allowed Greedy the Cat Spirit to play with it.</p><p>After it stayed in the Apricot Realm for so long, Dragon Apricot had also taken a liking to the conducting alchemy cat.</p><p>After it realized that Xu Xiaoshou had broken its toy and that it had no one to accompany it, it did not dare to say anything.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot had given Greedy the Cat Spirit many new toys.</p><p>Not only alchemy cauldrons, but from ancient times to the present, the Dragon Apricot had many items in its collection.</p><p>As long as it was a weapon or a shield with a groove, it would take it out for Greedy the Cat Spirit for its conducting alchemy.</p><p>This was one of the few lifeforms in the Apricot Realm other than the cows, sheep, and plants. It also had a beautiful landscape that the Dragon Apricot Spirit was gradually getting used to.</p><p>Today, as the World Tree, the Dragon Apricot had a premonition that an unknown terror was about to descend!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, a Holy Emperor is looking for the Apricot Realm and trying to invade.”</p><p>Without any hesitation, the Dragon Apricot Spirit transmitted this will to Xu Xiaoshou, the master of the Apricot Realm.</p><p>If the opponent was a demi-saint, it wouldn’t care.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even need to show up. The Dragon Apricot spirit could handle this by itself.</p><p>However, a Holy Emperor was different.</p><p>There were many types of Holy Emperors. If one was a high-level Holy Emperor and the power of the ancestral source was involved, they might be even stronger…</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit was indeed not good at fighting among its peers. For example, it never wanted to fight the blood tree.</p><p>It was only the World Tree now.</p><p>If the enemy of the world it wanted to protect was too strong, it would need the owner of the world to share the burden.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit!</p><p>When the voice of the Dragon Apricot Spirit sounded in his mind, Xu Xiaoshou’s hair stood on end. He finally understood what Bei Huai’s goal was.</p><p>Xu Yue Grey Palace’s Saint beast, Apricot Realm’s conducting alchemy cat-Greedy the Cat Spirit!</p><p>“Bei Huai’s test subject, substitute…”</p><p>“He’s testing the ghost beast? That’s right, the red-clothed people of the Holy Divine Palace catches so many ghost beasts every year. They can’t possibly kill all of them, right?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
