It’s very urgent!”</p><p>The two calm yet agitated sentences caused Aunt Xiang to almost lose her cool.</p><p>Was this the final moment?</p><p>Had Xu Xiaoshou been forced into a corner?</p><p>“Bazhun’an said that he wanted to exert pressure on this brat. There is no need to care about those who are at the demi-saint level and below…”</p><p>Aunt Xiang wanted to confirm the level of the enemy, but she quickly killed that thought.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not a fool. He would not play such a cheap prank.</p><p>He didn’t even explain the situation and only asked for help. It meant that the situation was so critical that he was only allowed to say these two short sentences.</p><p>Without hesitation, Aunt Xiang used her final trump card and slammed her palm on the ground.</p><p>“Summoning Technique!”</p><p>With a bang, a spiritual source fluctuation spread out between the trees.</p><p>The Heaven and Earth spiritual energy gathered crazily and soon the outline of an illusory bald man appeared.</p><p>However, this virtual image was much dimmer than before!</p><p>“What’s going on…”</p><p>Aunt Xiang frowned. She could see that the eyes of the virtual image were dull. It was no different from an ordinary person’s virtual image. It could only be used to increase combat strength and could not communicate.</p><p>“Xiangxiang?”</p><p>A surprised voice came from afar. It was obvious that it had sensed the fluctuation of the spiritual source. Yan’er was worried that something was wrong.</p><p>Aunt Xiang’s expression was solemn, but she did not even turn her head. She teased, “If you’re curious, you can come over and take a look. You can also learn from me. My man is a higher void. I’ve summoned a virtual image.”</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>A shocked cry came from afar.</p><p>Yan’er’s eyes widened. She hid behind a tree and her face turned red as her pupils trembled.</p><p>In an instant, her mind was filled with thoughts, and countless beautiful images appeared.</p><p>Dear Xiangxiang’s words had overturned all her knowledge of the Saint Spiritual Cultivation!</p><p>Could one play around with a virtual image in this manner?</p><p>“Wake up!”</p><p>On the other side, Aunt Xiang jumped up and slapped the sluggish beast’s face without hesitation.</p><p>The virtual image did not move.</p><p>Aunt Xiang realized something and her red lips parted slightly.</p><p>“Did this blockhead recite the name and entered the ruins?”</p><p>“D*mn it! How stupid can you get? Can’t you use your brain? How can I go in?”</p><p>Aunt Xiang wished she could go into the Four Symbols Secret Realm and teach The Divine a lesson.</p><p>However Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t wait any longer!</p><p>She fished out a short sword from her spatial ring and took a deep breath.</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>The short sword pierced her own chest.</p><p>“Oh…”</p><p>Aunt Xiang grunted.</p><p>The excruciating pain caused her delicate body to tremble, and her eyelids began to twitch.</p><p>“Xiangxiang?” Yan’er’s worried voice came from behind again.</p><p>“Mm, don’t!” Aunt Xiang let out another seductive moan.</p><p>In an instant, there was a soft ‘pui’ in the distance, and suddenly there was no sound at all.</p><p>The virtual image shook.</p><p>The surrounding spiritual source surged up with a bang and exploded into intangible airwaves.</p><p>This fluctuation caused the trees to tremble violently. Yan’er, who hid behind a tree, was so shocked that she covered her eyes tightly. She wished she could cover her ears with two more hands and silently moved away.</p><p>She stopped quietly and wanted to turn back, but she did not dare to turn back…</p><p>“Xiang’er?”</p><p>The Divine’s virtual image’s eyes also gained intelligence.</p><p>When he woke up, he saw Xiang Yaoyao holding a dagger that was imbedded deep in her heart. He flew into a rage. “Who dared to hurt you?”</p><p>Aunt Xiang did not have time to explain.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou? I’m going to kill him now! Don’t worry, his soul can’t even enter the cycle of reincarnation!” The virtual image of The Divine was also angry and wanted to leave.</p><p>“Idiot, come back!” Aunt Xiang was so angry that her red lips bled. “Something happened to Xu Xiaoshou. Find him and protect him…”</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>“Hurry up, go!”</p><p>“Oh, okay.”</p><p>“Come back! I can’t sense who his enemy is. It might be a Holy Emperor. Can you sense who it is?”</p><p>Weng!</p><p>All the life force within a radius of a thousand miles suddenly disappeared.</p><p>Yan’er, who was behind the tree, did not have time to go back and take a peek. She felt that she had lost all her strength and slumped weakly under the tree.</p><p>There was still a hint of confusion in her eyes.</p><p>Strange, I haven’t heard anything or seen anything yet…</p><p>He activated the Human Realm Dao and his virtual image instantly solidified. He was like a God who had descended in person. He only raised his eyes slightly before his eyes narrowed.</p><p>He rubbed Aunt Xiang’s head and did not say anything else. He only said in a slightly distressed tone, “You heal first. Don’t worry about the battle. I will solve the problem quickly.”</p><p>“Who was it?” Aunt Xiang asked.</p><p>“Bei Huai.” The Divine said after a moment of silence.</p><p>Bei Huai?</p><p>Who was that?</p><p>Aunt Xiang was momentarily stunned before her pupils trembled. “What? Bei…”</p><p>“Holy Emperor?” She asked in a hushed voice.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Are you confident?”</p><p>“It’s merely Bei Huai…”</p><p>“Don’t treat it as something trivial. You haven’t undergone sanctification yet! Don’t kill yourself… Why don’t we do this? If you can’t save him, then don’t. Xu Xiaoshou isn’t that important… You entered the Ran Ming ruins?” Aunt Xiang changed the topic. She didn’t want The Divine to take the risk anymore.</p><p>“Yes, I was worried about you.”</p><p>After The Divine stopped speaking, his gaze fell on the wound on Xiang’er’s heart that had been pierced by the short sword.</p><p>Whenever he encountered a near death situation, he would automatically appear. This was the passive method of the Summoning Technique.</p><p>No one in the surroundings could threaten Xiang’er. It was obvious that she did this to herself.</p><p>The Divine was not stupid.</p><p>Xiang’er even harmed herself so that she could summon him to protect someone, so how could Xu Xiaoshou not be important?</p><p>“Don’t worry, I won’t die.”</p><p>The Divine hugged the petite and pliant Xiang’er and rubbed her head. “You know very well how strong I am.”</p><p>“Yes…” Aunt Xiang closed her eyes and stopped trying to dissuade him. “Be careful.”</p><p>When she opened her eyes again, the towering beast had already disappeared.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
