Everyone must eliminate him. How could our Tiansang Spirit Palace possibly shelter such a person?” Xiao Qixiu’s eyes narrowed, his tone righteous.</p><p>Bazhun’an remained silent, casting a glance at Xuan Wuji.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Patriarch Wuji let out another snort, but no movement followed, and the patterns of the void revealed nothing.</p><p>The law enforcers realized that Xiao Qixiu and the trio had vanished from their sight.</p><p>“I’m looking for Ye Xiaotian,” Bazhun’an spoke again.</p><p>Xiao Qixiu looked up at the changing patterns in the void, took a deep breath, and pointed behind him, “Gentlemen, this way, please.”</p><p>In a thatched hut.</p><p>With a creak, Qiao Qianzhi had just opened the door when he caught sight of four figures.</p><p>His scalp tingled, and with a snap, he hurriedly shut the wooden door.</p><p>“Xiao Qixiu, get out of here!”</p><p>But the door was blocked by a sword.</p><p>Xiao Qixiu pushed hard, glaring at the cowardly old man inside.</p><p>“Do you still have the nerve to tell me to leave?”</p><p>“You don’t even dare to show yourself. You coward old turtle!”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi was on the brink of madness, his eyes widened in disbelief, “You brought these people here…”</p><p>“They are looking for Ye Xiaotian.”</p><p>“Oh? Well, in that case, come on in,” Qiao Qianzhi forced a laugh, quickly opening the door wide and stepping aside:</p><p>“Gentlemen, please come in.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian stood bewildered before the wooden table, the piece of succulent roasted goose meat held by his chopsticks dropped with a thud. “You two…”</p><p>He was about to run.</p><p>Bazhun’an walked in from outside.</p><p>“Sang Qiye is in trouble.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian floated in mid-air, his steps halted at the sound, turning his gaze back, “Sleeveless Saint Servant? What concern is that of mine?”</p><p>“To be precise, it’s about your friend Sang Qiye’s disciple, Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou? Haha, how is that my concern?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is deeply loyal. To save his master, he’s trapped in a dangerous place in the Central Region…” Bazhun’an sighed, “He’s truly a sentimental person.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian listened to the emotionless sigh, his lips twitching, “What does any of this have to do with me?”</p><p>“They are in the Central Region; we are in the Eastern Region. It’s too late to go there now. The fastest way is through you.”</p><p>“Hahaha, don’t you have Spirit Crystals to use the teleportation portal? I can provide you with three.” Ye Xiaotian laughed heartily.</p><p>“That would be traced.”</p><p>“Hahaha, am I a teleportation portal?!” Ye Xiaotian broke into a boisterous laughter.</p><p>“You are, and currently the only usable one that won’t be targeted!” Bazhun’an said convincingly, with a hint of admiration in his tone.</p><p>“You have reached the Higher Void level, the only Spatial Upanishad of this era, only a step away from becoming an Upanishad demi-saint. With just a thought, you can traverse between the Eastern and Central Regions.”</p><p>“Not only that, you’ve stayed out of sight in the Spirit Palace, yet your power can now dominate the world. Without a demi-saint appearing, who can contend with you? Once a demi-saint appears, you can even be sanctified!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was stunned.</p><p>This praise was too embarrassing, especially coming from the Eighth Sword Deity…</p><p>Ye Xiaotian had indeed reached the Higher Void level.</p><p>Ever since he left the Spirit Palace and cultivated the Spatial Upanishad to the Cutting Path Stage, his path of spiritual cultivation had been smooth sailing, without any bottlenecks.</p><p>Or perhaps, those bottlenecks had been blocking him during his decades in the Spirit Palace, and now, after years of training, he had finally broken through.</p><p>Even sanctification…</p><p>To tell the truth, he already had a demi-saint person in his hand!</p><p>Ye Xiaotian hadn’t been sanctified, but as one of the Four Disciples of the Holy Palace, he knew some of the secrets of sanctification. He just didn’t want to rush into it.</p><p>“I am me, and you are you,” Ye Xiaotian shook his head, drawing a clear line. He didn’t want to get involved in the whirlpool of the Saint Servant and the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>“In the Southern Region, there’s Black Heart Fruit Clan and Demi-Saint Zang Ren. He saw me once and chose to enter the fray without meeting me. He’s very wise,” Bazhun’an said.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian fell silent for a moment.</p><p>He had heard of Demi-Saint Zang Ren.</p><p>And now, he had pledged allegiance to the Saint Servant?</p><p>“You have worked with Xu Xiaoshou, befriended Sleeveless, and even resigned as the Dean of the Spirit Palace to go to Yunlun Mountain. The Holy Divine Palace has issued a warrant for you, and today, I’ve personally met you…” Bazhun’an smiled ambiguously, “Do you think you can still stay out of it?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian opened his mouth, unable to speak.</p><p>He thought of the last letter from Elder Sang…</p><p>“Yunlun Mountain Range, Saint Origin Crystal.”</p><p>That bloody Saint Origin Crystal! It was a letter that dragged him into this mess. He even took it seriously, painstakingly searching for that damn rock, only to be dragged into the bloody Abyss Island and barely escape by tearing open a spatial rift!</p><p>Right now, Ye Xiaotian wanted to grab Elder Sang by the head and pluck out the few strands of despicable hair he had left!</p><p>After a moment of silence, Ye Xiaotian calmly spoke, without a hint of agitation, “Where is Xu Xiaoshou causing trouble now?”</p><p>“In the Central Region.”</p><p>“His opponent…”</p><p>“Do you think it could possibly be a Holy Emperor?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian pondered.</p><p>Even a demi-saint wouldn’t be able to do anything to him with his Spatial Upanishad.</p><p>Reflecting on his reclusive decades in the Spirit Palace, his two comebacks—one as a Sovereign, unable to defeat Bazhun’an, and the other as a Cutting Path Stage cultivator, unable to subdue Huang Quan—nearly led him to a state of depression.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
