She was just on her way.</p><p>As she parted the curtains, Ah Yao, who was covered in dust like a poor commoner, had a sorrowful look in her eyes as she clutched the pipa in her hand tightly.</p><p>Her home was gone.</p><p>Aunt Xiang didn’t know why she still came to the teahouse.</p><p>She had only sent the three women away to give herself enough time to escape. There was no way she would bring the three women with her.</p><p>But perhaps it was because she recalled their old ties…</p><p>Perhaps she was just saying it, but she still had a grudge against the traitor in her heart and wanted to find the person…</p><p>By the time Aunt Xiang realized it, she was already in front of the Dong Ji Teahouse.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The chill in her heart caused Aunt Xiang’s face to turn pale.</p><p>Holy Emperor Guidance?</p><p>Aunt Xiang’s pupils dilated again.</p><p>“No! That’s not right!”</p><p>“Why did I come back to Jade Capital City? Didn’t I escape in the direction of Cross Corner Street?”</p><p>S-Saint Holy Emperor Guidance?</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>Flashes of lights and shadows swept down from the sky.</p><p>Waves of spiritual source fluctuations erupted at the same time.</p><p>In an instant, the Dong Ji Teahouse was surrounded by a group of white-clothed people.</p><p>“This is?”</p><p>The customers in the teahouse were still confused.</p><p>In the sky, it was unknown who made the first move. Under the bounded domain, suddenly all the white-clothed people disappeared, and only the obscure spiritual source fluctuations were left on the street.</p><p>“Weng weng weng…”</p><p>Layer after layer of realms formed on the bounded domain.</p><p>Dongdong, who was in the alley behind the teahouse, could only turn around. She managed to take a look at Aunt Xiang whom she would never see again.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>She covered her red lips and shook her head silently. Tears welled up in her eyes.</p><p>“Aunt Xiang???”</p><p>The candied haws dropped to the ground. Mei’er looked sideways and was stunned for a moment. Her aura suddenly exploded.</p><p>At this moment, she completely forgot all her distracting thoughts. In her mind, there was only the image of the death of a woman.</p><p>“Who dares to touch my Aunt Xiang!!!”</p><p>Mei’er pulled out a painting from the void. It was a painting of a mountain and a spring, with birds flying around the flowers.</p><p>“Higher Void World, Flower and Bird Painting Scroll!”</p><p>The long street turned.</p><p>Everything dropped into that picture.</p><p>The circle in the picture not only showed mountains, rivers, and birds, but it also showed Aunt Xiang, who remained unperturbed amid the hundredfold bounded domain.</p><p>“Weng…”</p><p>In the void, the Divine Path Principles surged.</p><p>Mei’er had just crossed the hundredfold bounded domain and entered the innermost world.</p><p>The pattern of the Great Path appeared. In front of the hundreds of white-clothed people, an actual regal and tall figure that was like the Emperor appeared.</p><p>He was dressed in a white robe with star patterns embroidered on it. He had a piece of jade that hung on his waist and a Sinan in his hand. His facial features were regular and he was smiling.</p><p>Shockingly, it was the current head of the Holy Divine Palace, Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao…”</p><p>“Demi-saint Incarnation?!”</p><p>Mei’er’s mind was distracted for a moment.</p><p>In the next moment, she felt that her thoughts had been delayed and could no longer be connected.</p><p>The world started to spin and flip.</p><p>Soon, Aunt Xiang’s shocked and sorrowful face appeared in her line of vision.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>Blood flowed like a pillar.</p><p>When Mei’er turned around again and saw her headless corpse lying on the ground, her pupils had already lost their focus.</p><p>Thump.</p><p>The head hit the ground. It was under the feet of the man in the white robe.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>“I am… a higher void level.”</p><p>“How is that possible… I could not even tell… when he took action…”</p><p>Mei’er tried her best to regain contact with her body.</p><p>She was a higher void level, so she could easily retrieve her head, not to mention that she had the God’s Blessing on her.</p><p>However, she discovered that there was a star chart on her neck that cut off all the connections between her true self.</p><p>There was also a star chart on the neck of the headless corpse in the distance. Not only did it suppress the surging spiritual source, but it also shattered the energy reserve.</p><p>“I am not a higher void level…”</p><p>“I, am already a mortal?”</p><p>Mei’er tried her best to tilt her head back. Finally, before she closed her eyes, the towering Hallmaster Dao appeared in her vision again.</p><p>He used a white handkerchief to wipe the bloodstains on the fifth-grade Master Stage spiritual sword body in his hand.</p><p>He didn’t even look sideways or lower his head. After he wiped his sword, he casually threw the handkerchief away.</p><p>Vision…</p><p>The white folds filled up gracefully as it was dyed blood red.</p><p>Mei’er’s eyes widened, but she could no longer see any color outside the darkness. Soon, she stopped breathing.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked straight ahead at the unfamiliar woman’s face and said softly.</p><p>“Long time no see, Xiang Yaoyao.”</p><p>“Did I scare you?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
