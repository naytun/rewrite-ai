The power of the ancestral source under the Penetrating Divine Senses was simply shocking!</p><p>However…</p><p>There were very few people who could truly understand the current situation.</p><p>After more than twenty auras, the Vermilion Bird world was still not destroyed by the Heavenly Ancestor Red Scorched Hand. The Holy Emperor Qilin’s eyes flashed with a mocking light as it sighed.</p><p>“Indeed, your talent is the best in the world.”</p><p>“It’s a pity that time is a hurdle that no one can overcome. It’s the heaviest obstacle for a genius. It’s his annoyance and your sigh. A talent that had not been realized is worthless!”</p><p>Bei Huai saw how strong Xu Xiaoshou would be after he grew up. He would definitely be comparable to the adult Ten High Nobles.</p><p>But who was Xu Xiaoshou’s opponent?</p><p>It was the adult Ten High Nobles who had already reached the great success stage!</p><p>It was the Holy Emperor Bei Huai and the perfect combination of the Holy Emperor Bei Huai and the Holy Emperor Qilin!</p><p>The flower had its charm, that meant that it had worked hard to bloom.</p><p>But who hasn’t been charming before? It was just that the times were different, and the world had forgotten that he, Bei Huai, had once worked hard.</p><p>“Ka…”</p><p>When the Vermilion Bird world was finally destroyed by his willpower and the Heavenly Ancestor Red Scorched Hand arrived, the Holy Emperor Qilin made its move.</p><p>Its horn emitted a faint light.</p><p>“Sunken Earth world!”</p><p>The other four powers of the five elements were only borrowed.</p><p>The earth element power that belonged to the Holy Emperor Qilin’s dao shone glaringly under Bei Huai’s control.</p><p>An order was given.</p><p>The Holy Emperor realm encompassed the entire Qilin world.</p><p>The Heaven and Earth Great Path was dyed with the color of thick yellow soil.</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin was rooted in the void, but it could mobilize all the power of the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>Amidst the rumbling and shaking of the entire Qilin world, the khaki-colored Path Principles gathered into morph forms and transformed into chains. These chains frantically wrapped around the body of the White Bone Giant whose flesh and blood had yet to be fully regenerated.</p><p>At the same time, filthy purple soil, heavy black soil, dirty green soil, neutral yellow soil, bloody red soil appeared in the void… and so forth!</p><p>An endless amount of soil appeared. The energy was condensed and compressed to the extreme. Even a piece the size of a fingernail had a gravitational force of ten thousand catties.</p><p>In this battle situation, with just one move, there appeared to be more than that.</p><p>The countless clumps of soil instantly filled the entire blue sky of the Qilin world and turned it into a colorful land!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>How could those who saw this not be frightened?</p><p>This was the power of a Holy Emperor!</p><p>The power of one move could turn the sky into the earth, and then turn the earth into a prison!</p><p>The blue sky turned into the earth, and the center of the world became its target with the arrival of the Holy Emperor Qilin’s horn-the White Bone Giant!</p><p>“+(Locked-on, Passive points+)+1.”</p><p>The world had changed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt the attraction force on his body increase by a million times. An unknown terror filled his entire body.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>“Time…”</p><p>He did not manage to make a sound. In just half a breath’s time.</p><p>“Boom boom…”</p><p>The land that hung in the sky with the White Bone Giant as the center, began to collapse.</p><p>Countless pieces of heavy soil smashed into the flesh, torso, and bones of the White Bone Giant like a world-breaking hammer that shattered pieces of hard bones!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The people below were shocked.</p><p>The entire world turned upside down once again.</p><p>This time, the ground tilted and turned into the White Bone Giant who stood upright!</p><p>With the explosion of the Sunken Earth world, the ground of the Qilin world seemed to have built up an unbreakable wall.</p><p>The vitality within the wall was gone.</p><p>The Heavenly Ancestor Red Scorched Hand that had broken through the Five Era Imperial Realm was completely worn out. It no longer posed a threat to the form of the Holy Emperor Qilin. Under the impact of the Sunken Earth world, it was completely penetrated and became like a wall of earth.</p><p>“Gulp…”</p><p>Everyone gulped.</p><p>So, he still lost?</p><p>No matter how strong Xu Xiaoshou was… he was indeed strong enough. The Heavenly Ancestor’s hand and Penetrating Divine Senses were both powers that transcended eras and realms.</p><p>But Bei Huai was the same!</p><p>Time was indeed like what Bei Huai had said. It was a person’s destiny, a hurdle that even the Saint Servant Lord Shou could not cross?</p><p>No!</p><p>Perhaps, that should be called a heavenly chasm…</p><p>“This farce shall end here.”</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin said this leisurely.</p><p>Just like how it had never taken Xu Xiaoshou to heart, the extent that it could be surprised by this person had already reached its limit.</p><p>Did they really think that everyone in the world was The Divine who could fight a Holy Emperor with a virtual image, break through the At the Gates of Hell, and reverse their fate?</p><p>As everyone was aware, The Divine did not even touch him after Bei Huai took over the Qilin. He vanished into thin air.</p><p>“Greedy the Cat Spirit…”</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin’s deep blue eyes shone with a dark light. It began to search for the ghost beast aura on the ground.</p><p>Shortly after, its eyes settled and joy appeared.</p><p>However, at the same time, a trace of astonishment appeared in its dark blue eyes.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>At the foot of the ground of the Qilin world, a dazzling Power Upanishad Formation suddenly appeared.</p><p>A scepter had unknowingly appeared in the hand of the White Bone Giant whose body had been trapped and pierced through by the Holy Emperor’s power.</p><p>Compared to the giant that was taller than the sky, the scepter was almost unnoticeable.</p><p>Bei Huai suddenly recalled something.</p><p>At that time, when Xu Xiaoshou first appeared, he held this scepter in his hand!</p><p>“Time Upanishad…”</p><p>When the Power Upanishad Formation appeared for the second time, everyone could clearly see its entire formation.</p><p>Complicated gears, mysterious pendulums, obscure patterns… What was interwoven and outlined was the power called ‘time’.</p><p>“Hualala…”</p><p>A sound of intangible water flow came from behind the ground. It was not water, but time.</p><p>Then, it turned into a winding river. This was not a river, but fate!</p><p>At this moment, an unbending and defiant voice appeared after the defeat. It also landed with great force before the White Bone Giant was sealed into the earth.</p><p>Everyone suddenly remembered!</p><p>Before the White Bone Giant was buried in the Sunken Earth world that the Holy Emperor had ordered, it had indeed made a sufficient reaction!</p><p>That sound.</p><p>It was after he said ‘not good’.</p><p>It was dissatisfaction, it had been tampered with and it stubbornly survived in the face of death.</p><p>“Time is up to me, life is up to me!”</p><p>The moment he said that, the Time Dao Discs spun in reverse and the river of fate flowed back to the unknown.</p><p>Reality lies between illusions and could not be defined.</p><p>The cycle of reincarnation and life was attributed to human beings.</p><p>Man was the Ruler!</p><p>Man was the Heaven, the Earth, and the root of all things!</p><p>“Dao!”</p><p>The world turned backward and the scenery started to spin.</p><p>“Time!”</p><p>The world became calm, and fear drowned out the waves.</p><p>“Human!”</p><p>The light on the Holy Emperor Qilin’s horn was extinguished.</p><p>Bei Huai sighed deeply from the bottom of his heart.</p><p>With a loud explosion, countless lumps of soil erupted from the body of the White Bone Giant.</p><p>The dirt left it, blood left it, justice left it, filth left it…</p><p>Everything that could perish departed from the White Bone Giant.</p><p>The White Bone Giant was indeed a White Bone Giant. With the power of the Human Realm Dao, it could absorb all the techniques of Heaven and Earth and was able to transform to the limit.</p><p>Ultimate Giant!</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin sighed and said, “What a pity, time is a hurdle that no one can overcome.”</p><p>Bei Huai was surprised yet again.</p><p>These were his words!</p><p>Why, why would he say it again at this moment?</p><p>“Kong Yuhen is here again?”</p><p>On the other side, the White Bone Giant destroyed the Vermilion Bird world with a single palm strike. With the help of the power of the Human Realm Dao, it transformed into a complete Ultimate Giant.</p><p>It pressed down with one hand and used its destructive power to stop the little Holy Emperor Qilin’s head before the Sunken Earth world appeared. He grounded it into the spacetime debris.</p><p>The path of morality collapsed.</p><p>Everything was lost.</p><p>Below the Qilin world, there was only the resurrected Heavenly Ancestor Red Scorched Hand and Xu Xiaoshou’s casual laughter.</p><p>“I can do what no one else can.”</p><p>“So, go to hell!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
