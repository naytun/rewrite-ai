She held the jade talisman tightly. Her eyes flashed with anticipation and she asked, “What about when it’s not something urgent?”</p><p>“You can still use it to get there.” The Storyteller smiled. “Just let me know. I can go to Abyss Island and accompany you to plant flowers and hoe the fields.”</p><p>“Who wants your company?” Bai Yezi scoffed at him.</p><p>However, with this jade talisman, she would have the opportunity to see her big brother at any time, which made her happy.</p><p>The previous Half-Moon Bay had a natural barrier like the Shengshen Continent. It was difficult to see what the outside world looked like after one entered it.</p><p>Now all was good. Big Brother had the Abyss Island and the Saint Servant had a true foundation.</p><p>Hei Yezi also held the jade talisman solemnly, but her thoughts were quite calm. “Since that’s the case, he can’t find you, so there’s only one goal left…”</p><p>“That’s right.” Bazhun’an nodded in approval.</p><p>“But…” Bai Yezi also wanted to be praised, but she couldn’t figure out how Xu Xiaoshou could be threatened Sister Xiangxiang was held hostage.</p><p>According to the information, Lord Shou and Sister Xiangxiang had only met a few times. Their relationship was not as deep-rooted as theirs.</p><p>“Has Wangze Holy Emperor made his move?” Bazhun’an changed the topic.</p><p>“Yes!” Bai Yezi’s eyes lit up as she raised her hand to answer. “He made his move!”</p><p>“Xiao Ye… After his Spatial Upanishad underwent sanctification, the Rao clan’s Holy Emperor immediately appeared and forced the Spatial Upanishad to spread to the four-hill mountain… Li Fugui’s men have been following the battle.</p><p>“Right now, Ye was only able to resist due to his reliance on the Holy Emperor from the Holy Palace White Tower’s lineage, but the outcome is still uncertain.”</p><p>“After all, a Holy Emperor might not want to fight to the death with another Holy Emperor for the sake of a demi-saint.”</p><p>Bazhun’an nodded silently.</p><p>There were two Holy Emperors in the Holy Palace. One of them was Zi Chong of the Spiritual Gods lineage. He controlled half of the power of the demi-saint ancestors. This one basically did not appear in the world and was only a guardian.</p><p>Secondly, there was the white dragon from the White Tower. It had a relatively intact portion of the power of the Dragon Ancestor and stayed in the mysterious Shengxuan Gate sect all year round.</p><p>From the era of the Dragon Ancestor until now, there were only two Holy Emperors left, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon and the Saint white dragon.</p><p>The rest were a bunch of dragons who had their living space compressed and now lived in the Seven Breaks Dragon Cave.</p><p>Hei Yezi looked at her big brother’s solemn expression and asked, “Big brother, are you thinking that the Rao Clan’s Holy Emperor attack is also related to Elder Dao’s attack on Lord Shou?”</p><p>“Definitely.” Bazhun’an looked over.</p><p>“Then why didn’t the Holy Emperor of the Rao clan appear after the battle with Lord Shou? Why did he choose to target Ye and the space instead?”</p><p>“I don’t know.” Bazhun’an shook his head.</p><p>The few people beside him fell silent at the same time, but they quickly understood.</p><p>That’s right, if my big brother knew what Elder Dao’s thoughts were, Elder Dao wouldn’t have entered the arena personally.</p><p>“If he attacks directly, he must have the confidence that he can kill…” Bai Yezi murmured with a worried look in her eyes.</p><p>She had never seen Lord Shou before, but she had paid attention to Lord Shou’s growth in her previous communication with the Storyteller.</p><p>It was too terrifying!</p><p>This person was simply not human!</p><p>His growth speed, objectively speaking, was even faster than Big Brother’s!</p><p>It didn’t seem impossible for such a person to provoke Dao Qiongcang to make a move personally. However, when she thought about it, she felt that the two of them were not on the same level…</p><p>However, even the unpredictable Dao Qiongcang had taken the initiative. One could imagine how highly he regarded Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>Bazhun’an looked at the trio’s worried expressions, then he smiled and said lightly.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou has risen very quickly”</p><p>“What I can do is to push his growth due to his lazy nature, so that he won’t be caught and killed the moment he comes out of the water.”</p><p>“When he was weak, no matter how crazy he was, I could still protect him and keep him in check.”</p><p>“Now, it’s hard to say who will protect who… Since it is destined to be his tribulation, if he can’t overcome it, then he is not worthy to transcend this era.”</p><p>No one understood Xu Xiaoshou better than Bazhun’an.</p><p>He had paid close attention to this little fellow ever since his Acquired Stage Spiritual Cultivation. It could be said that he had witnessed his growth.</p><p>Not even Elder Sang.</p><p>After all, Elder Sang had missed the second half of Xu Xiaoshou’s performance.</p><p>The young eagle had to spread its wings high in the sky, and no matter how close or protective others were, they couldn’t fly on his behalf.</p><p>For example, the Nine Death Thunder Calamity, the saint calamity, and the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation. Outsiders were unable to help them, and they were all tribulations that the Spiritual Cultivator had to face in order to grow.</p><p>Whether or not he could get through it was all up to him.</p><p>It was hard to tell whether it was stunning or not.</p><p>This was a hurdle that geniuses had to go through. Bazhun’an had gone through it, but it could also be said that he had not.</p><p>The Storyteller, Hei Yezi, Bai Yezi…</p><p>These people were a level weaker and would find it hard to understand in this lifetime.</p><p>In the Flower Pavilion, the few of them fell silent. No one knew what was on their minds.</p><p>After a long time, Hei Yezi set this matter aside and focused on Bazhun’an instead.</p><p>“Big brother, your cultivation level…”</p><p>Her eyes were filled with worry. After all, even with her cultivation level, now as she looked at Bazhun’an.</p><p>The latter didn’t even have a cultivation level at the first realm of Spiritual Cultivation.</p><p>“It’s still half a step away.”</p><p>“Therefore, it is very difficult for me to make a move.”</p><p>Bazhun’an smiled as he raised his wine cup.</p><p>Bai Yezi’s eyes shifted, but she thought of something else. “Big Brother, the god slayer ruins seem to cover the five regions. I wonder if the Holy Emperor’s secret realm had been covered?”</p><p>Bazhun’an’s fingers trembled, and the wine cup was frozen at the corner of his lips.</p><p>Bai Yezi chuckled and teased. “Don’t you miss us? Don’t you miss big sister Yue too? Do you have any plans to visit the god slayer ruins? Maybe you can meet her.”</p><p>“Xiao Bai!” Hei Yezi turned around and shouted coldly. When she turned around, there was a slight flame of anger that flickered in her eyes.</p><p>Roar, roar, roar!</p><p>Charge, charge, charge!</p><p>Bazhun’an put down his wine cup and smiled bitterly.</p><p>He spread his hands and looked at his eight fingers, slightly absent-minded.</p><p>The sword is sealed for the old and old me became a saint… Bazhun’an raised his head and said seriously.</p><p>“I’m afraid that if I go, I’ll really see her… The Hidden Sword Technique might fail at the last moment.”</p><p>Weng!</p><p>The grass and trees in the Flower Pavilion were shocked, and the spiritual sword trembled.</p><p>Kakaka!</p><p>The three-story wooden floor was split open by sword marks.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>All of a sudden, the pavilion’s great protection array exploded and shattered.</p><p>“Big brother! Calm down!”</p><p>“Calm down!” Hei Yezi was startled. “Calm down! Calm down! Take a deep breath, come, follow me, inhale… Hiss, exhale…Phew…”</p><p>Bazhun’an took a deep breath and suppressed the sword energy that was about to erupt from his chest. He ached all over and could not help but glare at Bai Yezi.</p><p>“I didn’t do it on purpose…” Bai Yezi was so frightened that she ducked and hid behind her sister.</p><p>Bazhun’an once again raised his wine cup to his lips.</p><p>At this moment, vague sword cries came from the Nine Heavens.</p><p>The spiritual swords in the Flower Pavilion flew into the sky and bowed toward the distant Central Region.</p><p>In the Land of Sins in the Southern Region, countless spiritual swords flew into the sky and bowed.</p><p>All the people in the five regions who had their sabers with them felt something. They looked at the spiritual swords in their hands as they flew in the sky and bowed in a certain direction.</p><p>Everyone saw this scene.</p><p>However, an instant later, they seemed to have forgotten about this.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>The Storyteller, Hei Yezi, and Bai Yezi were stunned. They glanced at the spiritual swords on the third floor of the Flower Pavilion that seemed to have been moved, but also seemed not to have not been moved. They glanced at their big brother in confusion.</p><p>“What happened just now?”</p><p>Bazhun’an could not drink the wine in the end. He stood up and looked into the distance and muttered to himself silently.</p><p>“He is still one step ahead.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
