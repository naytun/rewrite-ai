It has no effect on the Apricot Realm, and it can’t hide the Apricot Realm’s space node.”</p><p>“The person in front of me is just the thought incarnation of a Holy Emperor. His actions are deceptive, but it doesn’t mean that the soul hand that targeted the Apricot Realm came from Bei Huai.”</p><p>“Since the Ancestral Tree Dragon Apricot can’t stop him, then he should just attack the Apricot Realm directly. Why would he bother to do all that unnecessary stuff and transform his consciousness into a thought incarnation and talk so much nonsense?”</p><p>“There must be a reason for Bei Huai’s actions. This is definitely the key to break the situation!”</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou’s original will returned to his main body with so many doubts, the Spirit Dao Disc under his feet spun out at the same time.</p><p>Body, Spirit, and Will, the focus was on the three paths of body, soul, and will.</p><p>He knew too little about Bei Huai.</p><p>However, when he decided that he had to deal with Bei Huai, he recalled some of the details in his sealed memories.</p><p>He still remembered that when he dealt with Yi in the Yunlun Mountain Range, Patriarch Wuji mentioned something when he belittled Yi.</p><p>“In the five regions, there are even fewer people who truly specialize in the way of the spirit and soul than the ancient swordsman. Currently, the only one who succeeded is Bei Huai.”</p><p>It was this sentence that made Xu Xiaoshou instantly lock onto his direction and he firmly believed that the Spirit Dao Disc was the key to break the situation.</p><p>The Spirit Dao Disc corresponded to the soul!</p><p>As expected, when the Spirit Dao Disc appeared, Xu Xiaoshou’s thinking mode also shifted from focusing on the physical level of the body to focusing on the spiritual level of the soul.</p><p>When he looked at Bei Huai again, the person who stood amid the shattered void was no longer a barefooted white-robed man. Instead, it was a soul giant that was as tall as the Berserk Giant!</p><p>This soul energy body was too burly.</p><p>Its power was condensed to an outrageous level.</p><p>It was completely incomparable to Yi, Ghost Granny and others that he had seen before.</p><p>It even had substantial muscles and was so strong that it was like an enlarged version of The Divine after he opened the Human Realm Dao.</p><p>Perhaps, it should be said that…</p><p>Only the void general, who was a Holy Emperor and proficient in the Dao of Soul, could compare to Bei Huai’s soul body that Xu Xiaoshou currently saw!</p><p>“How do we fight this?”</p><p>When he came back to his senses, Xu Xiaoshou’s plan had yet to be implemented when he was shocked by the burly soul body.</p><p>In this short moment, he had regained control of his mind again.</p><p>However, since Xu Xiaoshou chose to return, he had his own solution.</p><p>In an instant, he switched his consciousness back to Jin Ren’s body, and Jin Ren’s consciousness returned to cry at the Ran Ming ruins and heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>However, in an instant, Xu Xiaoshou’s consciousness flashed back!</p><p>This was the only solution he had come up with to deal with Bei Huai’s ‘sadness’ ability:</p><p>“I will use my two bodies and the different spaces they are in to let Jin Ren deal with the negative emotions brought by Bei Huai. My main body will always be stuck in that gap. I can’t make any mistakes and will have to stay alert always.”</p><p>This method was very good, but the only disadvantage was that it was too tiring!</p><p>It was impossible for a human to switch between his consciousness several times in an instant. Even a demi-saint would be exhausted.</p><p>It was only because Xu Xiaoshou’s cross-functional control technique was already at the perfection level. He also had the ‘transformation’ to continuously consume the blood energy and spiritual source to make up for the mental deficit.</p><p>Otherwise, he would be exhausted to the point of death in a few breaths!</p><p>But it didn’t matter if he was tired, as long as it was useful.</p><p>When he stepped on the Spirit Dao Disc, Xu Xiaoshou could not only see Bei Huai’s powerful soul body, but also the power of his own soul that surged out as his thoughts gathered.</p><p>These powers were connected to the various items that he had signed a contract with through some obscure connections that ordinary people could not detect.</p><p>Spatial ring, Hidden Bitter, Flame Python, Fourth Sword… Even the Apricot Realm!</p><p>“This is the way!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s consciousness switched back and forth, and his eyes lit up.</p><p>He discovered why Bei Huai had to make his thought incarnation materialize in front of him and talk nonsense.</p><p>Through this method, Bei Huai made his thoughts boil, and the power of his soul boiled. Then, it highlighted the wisp of soul that he had bound to the Apricot Realm.</p><p>When he followed the map, he was able to find the Apricot Realm that wandered in the space-time debris that should not have been discovered!</p><p>“Soul power Upanishad?”</p><p>In the shattered world, where his blurry face could not be seen clearly, Bei Huai’s voice was filled with shock and bewilderment.</p><p>He could naturally tell that the Power Upanishad Formation under Xu Xiaoshou’s feet was too inferior.</p><p>But its strength was unquestionable!</p><p>When he stepped on this incomplete Power Upanishad Formation, Xu Xiaoshou entered a special state of ‘Unity of Man and the Heavens.”</p><p>At this moment, Bei Huai looked over. The Berserk Giant seemed to be more compatible with the divine soul than he was?</p><p>“You are very sharp.”</p><p>Bei Huai couldn’t help but praise.</p><p>No matter how Xu Xiaoshou cultivated this soul Power Upanishad Formation.</p><p>He was able to find the most correct entry point-the path of the spirit and soul without any knowledge about it and manifested this spiritual power.</p><p>This proved that Xu Xiaoshou’s battle consciousness was extremely high.</p><p>It also explained that this person had also specialized in the battle techniques of the divine soul.</p><p>At the same time, the Berserk Giant looked like it was still crying, but it had indeed been conscious all this while!</p><p>“Maybe you found a way to break it, but it’s useless. I’ll remember the aura of your soul.”</p><p>Bei Huai waved his sleeve.</p><p>Suddenly, the power of the divine soul hand outside the Apricot Realm became even more condensed, and another divine soul hand appeared on the other side.</p><p>His hands seemed to be catching a ball as he completely trapped the Apricot Realm and wanted to crush everything inside.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>Countless cracks appeared in the sky of the Apricot Realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
