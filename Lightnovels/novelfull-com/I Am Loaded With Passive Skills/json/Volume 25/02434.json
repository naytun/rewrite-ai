This is my ordinary self…”</p><p>“If you move your self, the mountains will shake, a tsunami will occur, the thunder will rumble, and the wind will howl. This is how the strength gathers for the entire body to move. This is the self of the Six Paths…”</p><p>“The mortal self is the fake self, the Six Paths is the true self…”</p><p>“The belief of the human world, the false and the truth belong to me…”</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Something seemed to have split in his mind.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded as he watched The Divine’s figure slowly materialize in front of him. He was suddenly terrified when he heard the thunder in his heart.</p><p>He finally understood why he had seen it, comprehended it, and even stepped on the Body Dao Disc to study it. It was like he copied the answer, but he still felt like he could never get it right.</p><p>The Six Paths of the Human Realm Dao actually treated the human realm as a person!</p><p>The Human Realm Dao was only an arm, a leg, or a strand of hair of that person.</p><p>When any part needed to be moved, the mountains, rivers, and seas were like the knees, waist, chest, and head. They would naturally cooperate with it.</p><p>The so-called ‘plunder’ was simply an illusion!</p><p>If he wanted to comprehend the Human Realm Dao based on this, he would definitely go astray!</p><p>The true Human Realm Dao was natural. It was only seconded or borrowed. It was not even ‘borrowed’ in that sense. It just conformed with the nature of the human body and you get the power you want.</p><p>“The Human Realm Dao, humans are the human world!”</p><p>Thunder rumbled in his mind. It was the last sentence.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was like a rock that had cracked. He felt enlightened and bright, and his heart was full of wonder. Light flowed through his whole body.</p><p>“I’ve comprehended it! I’ve comprehended it!”</p><p>He was ecstatic. When he looked at The Divine again with his newly gained knowledge, he saw the human body after the virtual image condensed.</p><p>He wasn’t alone!</p><p>He was on Gong Yang Mountain. It was like the heart, one of the most important organs in the human body and he mobilized all the power of the world for his use!</p><p>People…</p><p>The power was borrowed.</p><p>Trees…</p><p>The power was also borrowed.</p><p>Everything was like this, and so were the Path techniques!</p><p>Even the Holy Emperor Qilin had a powerful aura when it appeared.</p><p>When The Divine opened the Human Realm Dao, Xu Xiaoshou saw it through new eyes. He could clearly see that the Qilin was like a knee that lent strength to its arm. A small part of its strength flowed from its body to The Divine’s body.</p><p>The amount of energy that was lost was too little for the Holy Emperor Qilin.</p><p>However, to the virtual image of The Divine, it was extremely majestic. It filled his body in an instant, almost to the point of bursting.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou understood why his aim was only for the Hungry Ghost Path, and why The Divine wanted to open the Human Realm Dao again.</p><p>This was because the power he had borrowed last time, or rather, the power he had obtained from all the things in the world in the small world like the Four Symbols Secret Realm, was not enough to support him when he battled with the combined soul bodies of the Holy Emperor Qilin and Bei Huai.</p><p>Since this process needed to be repeated, Xu Xiaoshou wanted to learn it, The Divine did not have any expectations. However, he did not keep it to himself and instead, he calmly told him everything.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was tempted, but he finally suppressed his desire to try it out.</p><p>“Six Paths?”</p><p>In the air, the Holy Emperor Qilin looked up and the sky collapsed.</p><p>It had the essence of the human nature in its eyes. At this moment, the two seemed to be inseparable.</p><p>The corners of the Qilin’s lips tilted and a mocking look appeared in its eyes.</p><p>“The ancient martial arts Six Paths, the six divisions had not gained anything for decades. How can they comprehend it overnight?”</p><p>“Child’s play that’s accompanied by adults. You can save these houses games for your communication underworld. You really don’t have to use this play method in front of me. It’s simply ridiculous!”</p><p>Amidst the chaos among the living things, the Holy Emperor Qilin spoke in the human language as a claw descended from the sky.</p><p>This attack was simple and unpretentious, but it fell from the sky and caused the situation to change. It triggered the laws of the Great Path and attracted the black and yellow energy movement</p><p>“Earth element Holy Emperor power…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils constricted.</p><p>He could feel a similar power being drawn out from the Holy Emperor Qilin</p><p>This time, however, it was purely a Spiritual Cultivator technique. The Qilin had drawn upon the power of the earth.</p><p>This could be from Gong Yang Mountain.</p><p>It could also be the entire Qilin world!</p><p>“Boom…”</p><p>The sky shuddered. Gong Yang Mountain’s Antelope Peak and Horn Peak shook violently as rocks tumbled about everywhere.</p><p>Suddenly, it shattered and exploded and the sky and earth suffered a tremendous upheaval.</p><p>The Qilin Claw’s attack that was filled with the power of a single move, was targeted at The Divine, who had activated the Human Realm Dao, with an unstoppable momentum.</p><p>It was obvious that Bei Huai could also see that if The Divine did not die today, he would not be able to get close to Xu Xiaoshou and Greedy the Cat Spirit.</p><p>“Can you withstand it?”</p><p>“The Holy Emperor Qilin is weak, Bei Huai’s soul body is merely a sliver and The Divine is only a virtual image…”</p><p>“F*ck, they’re clearly trash. Why was the impact so strong?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that his human form in this Saint war was like a small boat in the deep sea that bobbed about in the wind and rain. It looked like it could capsize at any moment.</p><p>The Divine was more composed.</p><p>When the claw was about to hit him, he stepped on the void and shot up. He punched with both fists and his strength penetrated through the past and present.</p><p>“God Penetration!”</p><p>This explosive roar seemed to have condensed the power of a God. It exploded in the sky above the Qilin world. Everyone in the realm was shocked and looked up.</p><p>With this, The Divine’s aura was pushed to the peak.</p><p>“Ancient martial arts can also borrow power…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes widened as he saw The Divine’s tiny fists smash into the claw like an ant that tried to shake a tree.</p><p>“Dong…”</p><p>Outside the Qilin world, a power that was filled with the deep sounds of drums on the ancient battlefield spread out.</p><p>At this moment in Gong Yang Mountain, the world fell into dead silence.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
