This also extended the distance between the battle lines.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>The White Bone Giant pressed down, and Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>He could tell that Bei Huai’s move contained some hints of the Three Eras Prison Realm, but it was not totally that.</p><p>The most obvious was that the Three Eras Prison Realm was a soul body spiritual technique that guarded against The Divine’s Hungry Ghost Path.</p><p>The Five Era Imperial Realm, on the other hand, was formed by the power of the five elements and gathered into morph forms. When it was combined into a world, it was arranged in a straight line. It was distinctly apart and did not interfere with each other.</p><p>It was specially created to deal with the Heavenly Ancestor Red Scorched Hand!</p><p>Impromptu skill creation?</p><p>Bei Huai, what a powerful ability!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>An explosion sounded in the sky.</p><p>The Azure Dragon world was the first to bear the brunt and was instantly crushed by the Heavenly Ancestor Red Scorched Hand. The dense wood element power inside rumbled and exploded, and countless cracks appeared on the body of the world.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>A strange sound echoed softly in the inner realm.</p><p>In an instant, the Azure Dragon world turned into a world of white flames. The Heavenly Ancestor Red Scorched Hand pressed down firmly and the world exploded into crystal fragments with a bang.</p><p>A portion of the majestic energy that was emitted was automatically absorbed by Xu Xiaoshou’s body after he received the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy.</p><p>A portion of it was devoured by the White Bone Giant and transformed into energy supply for Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Black Tortoise world!”</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin’s eyes were solemn.</p><p>The Five Era Imperial Realm was one of his variations, but it was also condensed from the Holy Emperor Qilin’s power.</p><p>The defensive attack of the Holy Emperor’s true body was completely defenseless against Xu Xiaoshou’s attack?</p><p>However, his expectations still came true…</p><p>Wood makes fire.</p><p>With the Azure Dragon world in the lead, after it resisted the Heavenly Ancestor Red Scorched Hand, the large amount of energy movement on the white bone hand turned into a pure fire-type.</p><p>Water countered fire.</p><p>The Black Tortoise world was ranked second.</p><p>Bei Huai’s deep thoughts and strong battle reflexes were evident from this.</p><p>“Chi chi sizzle…”</p><p>When the Heavenly Ancestor Red Scorched Hand that was surrounded by white flames, entered the Black Tortoise World, Xu Xiaoshou could already feel that the power of his attack had been reduced by more than 30%.</p><p>Not only was he being consumed after he made a move, the Qilin’s Holy Emperor power also consumed him at a crazy rate. Bei Huai also made use of the way the five elements completed each other!</p><p>“As expected of the Ten High Nobles…”</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin seemed to have been parasitized by Bei Huai for the first time?</p><p>However, for a remnant soul to be able to use the Qilin’s power to such an extent, Bei Huai truly deserved the title of the Ten High Nobles!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>There was no doubt that even though its power had weakened, the Heavenly Ancestor Red Scorched Hand still broke through the Black Tortoise world. After all, it was the power of the Ultimate Giant, the power of the ancestral source, and the Penetrating Divine Senses.</p><p>Due to the restraint of the five elements, Xu Xiaoshou had no choice but to transform all his fire-type power. He still used the Heavenly Ancestor’s Power as the main force and continued to attack.</p><p>However, after he destroyed the second Black Tortoise world, his consumption was even greater.</p><p>He could only devour the remaining power of the Black Tortoise world, but he couldn’t help but attach a wisp of water-type energy movement to the Heavenly Ancestor Red Scorched Hand.</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin’s eyes revealed a look of comfort when he saw this.</p><p>“He wants to mess with me!”</p><p>How astute was Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>But even though he had read Bei Huai’s intentions, he seemed to have fallen into an endless loop.</p><p>Or he could stop attacking.</p><p>Or every time the attack broke through a realm, it had to devour the other party’s power.</p><p>Otherwise, the consumption would be too great and he would not be able to keep up at all!</p><p>“D*mned that Bei Huai…”</p><p>The third world, the Qilin world of the Five Era Imperial Realm!</p><p>Earth countered water. The Qilin’s earth element world was clearly here to restrain the power of the water element. Xu Xiaoshou flew into a rage and shattered another world.</p><p>The fourth world had yet to be touched.</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin took advantage of the moment when the three worlds were destroyed to catch its breath. With a wave of its front claw, the phantom of an Azure Dragon descended from the sky.</p><p>“Azure Dragon descent!”</p><p>Ow!!!</p><p>A dragon roar resounded all over.</p><p>A monstrous Azure Dragon broke out of the fourth world and turned into pure wood element with the Holy Emperor power that charged at the Heavenly Ancestor Red Scorched Hand.</p><p>This time, it was not wood that made fire.</p><p>After he devoured the power of the Holy Emperor Qilin world, Xu Xiaoshou exuded the aura of the earth element power.</p><p>Not to mention Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Even the Spiritual Cultivators below were shocked by the Heavenly Ancestor Red Scorched Hand as it broke through layers of boundaries and could read the Holy Emperor Qilin’s intentions.</p><p>Wood restraining wood!</p><p>This was a chain of restraints…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The phantom of the Azure Dragon was immediately devoured with great gusto.</p><p>However, the various powers in Xu Xiaoshou’s body were in disorder. It was extremely uncomfortable, as if he was being led by the nose.</p><p>The Fourth world, White Tiger world!</p><p>The gold and wood element in the White Tiger world resisted the Heavenly Ancestor Red Scorched Hand for a full 13 breaths of time before it broke.</p><p>In the fifth world, the Vermilion Bird world, fire countered metal!</p><p>At this moment, the Heavenly Ancestor Red Scorched Hand was already on the verge of collapse. It had endured four clashes of the Holy Emperor’s power!</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou was a Holy Emperor, he would be able to withstand it.</p><p>However, he was only a Sovereign Dao Realm with a demi-saint’s body. No matter how strong the Ultimate Giant was, it was beyond his limit at this moment…</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin was a true body!</p><p>Even though it was in a weak state, its power was still far stronger than Bei Huai’s remnant thought and the combined power of the Four Divine Pillars of the ghost beast Holy Emperor on Abyss Island!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, is able to break the defense of a Holy Emperor…”</p><p>In the world below, countless people stared at the charred black hand. It destroyed everything in its path as if it was rotten wood, and they were all on tenterhooks.</p><p>They set aside their positions.</p><p>Everyone looked forward to a grassroots reverse attack.</p><p>Everyone wanted to see the tale of the younger generation who subverted the older generation and trampled on the older generation to make a name for themselves unfold.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
