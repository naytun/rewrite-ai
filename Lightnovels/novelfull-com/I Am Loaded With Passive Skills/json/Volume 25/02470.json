On the stall were fresh spiritual weapons and spiritual physique organs from people that had just been killed and robbed.</p><p>Some people sold young men and women in cages publicly.</p><p>Some people gathered into groups and paraded through the streets and handed out flyers to the people around them…</p><p>“Learn about the Golden Technique Sect’s secret practices. The price is fair and you would not be deceived.”</p><p>“It’s definitely a proper Stealth Technique. It’s comparable to the Saint Servant Lord Shou’s Stealth Technique. Any passerby can learn it. It’s an exclusive secret technique. There’s no other like it.”</p><p>“Master the divine secrets, be educated in all laws… Brother, are you interested in joining our Divine Sect?”</p><p>“Shocking! The Saint Servant Lord Shou blasted the Rao Clan’s Holy Emperor of the Four Symbols Secret Realm in the Central Region. Only one Spirit Crystal and I will tell you about the Xu Rao love hate relationship…”</p><p>Due to the nature of the rules, the demi-saints from Half-Moon Bay couldn’t interfere.</p><p>Thus, there were many wanted criminals who gathered here. They were a mix of good and bad, with many evil and only a few righteous ones.</p><p>Bazhun’an was pulled away by the Storyteller and he continued to endure the chattering in his ears as they walked.</p><p>“Brother, brother, are you really alright? Even if Ye Xiaotian underwent sanctification, he’s only an Upanishad demi-saint. How can he defeat a Holy Emperor?”</p><p>“Brother, brother, why did you send Xuan Wuji over too? It would be great if he stayed by your side to protect you. It just so happened that his host body isn’t strong but he can still enter Half-Moon Bay.”</p><p>“Brother, brother, your two sisters said that they miss you. This time, they want you to go to the Flower Pavilion and meet them.”</p><p>“Brother, brother, it’s not easy to invite Palace Master Bai Zhou, right?”</p><p>“Brother, brother…”</p><p>“That’s enough.” Bazhun’an grabbed a flyer that read ‘Master the Divine Secret in three months from beginner to proficient level!’ He glanced at it and stuffed it into the Storyteller’s mouth and said helplessly.</p><p>“If we can’t beat him head-on, we can always run. Otherwise, let that pass… What’s Ye Xiaotian doing there?”</p><p>“Abyss Island underestimated Xu Xiaoshou’s potential. This time, we have to include this, no matter what.”</p><p>“Pah, I still feel that Xu Xiaoshou is very pitiful…” The Storyteller spat out the flyer. This flyer had passed through the hands of countless people – God only knew how dirty it was.</p><p>“He had already surfaced. If he doesn’t grow up quickly, he will be reincarnated three times in a month, one cycle every ten days.” Bazhun’an’s face remained calm.</p><p>“This big sister…” A man who passed by as he distributed flyers, dressed up as a Divine Sorcerer, stopped. His eyelids were slightly droopy, and he seemed very tired.</p><p>“Thank you, but I won’t sign it.” The Storyteller did not even turn his head.</p><p>“Uhh.” The Divine Sorcerer pointed at the flyer that was stained with saliva in the other party’s hand. He hesitated for a moment but did not ask for it back.</p><p>His gaze stopped at the red dress with high slits for a moment and a strange look flashed across his eyes. “Brother, you are the Storyteller, Ning Hong Hong?”</p><p>He then turned to look at the guy in the red dress. He lowered his head and counted eight fingers. He immediately gave a thumbs up and said.</p><p>“Brother, you guys are all high-quality imitations who have spent a lot”</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>“Sign your names. Your signatures would definitely be worth a lot.”</p><p>“Aren’t you preaching?”</p><p>“Earn some extra money… Why don’t you join the Divine Sect? I’ll only charge you for two signatures and won’t charge you any extra fees. How about that? The Divine Sorcerer raised his eyebrows.</p><p>In the course of his missionary work today, he had distributed flyers to thirty-two Storytellers, and this was excluding those who had ignored him.</p><p>On the other hand, he had only encountered thirteen Bazhun’an and only two of them had eight fingers.</p><p>It was the first time he had seen a ‘Ba and Story’ combination. It was very rare.</p><p>The Storyteller’s brows furrowed. He didn’t want to speak anymore and used his fingertips to take out an ancient book.</p><p>“Wow!” The Divine Sorcerer’s eyes lit up. “This is a Yin-Yang book about life and death. There’s also spatial fluctuations… Give me an autograph and I’ll pay for it, okay?”</p><p>“Asking for a beating!” Before the Storyteller made a move, Bazhun’an stopped him in time. They looked at the Divine Sorcerer and said.</p><p>“Throughout the Southern Region, your Divine Sect has developed quite quickly. There are people everywhere, and they have even infiltrated Half-Moon Bay. Who’s your boss?”</p><p>The missionary Divine Sorcerer stared calmly at Bazhun’an, as if he was waiting for something.</p><p>His lips moved, but he didn’t say anything.</p><p>Bazhun’an threw a few Spirit Crystals over.</p><p>“Clang..”</p><p>The Spirit Crystals fell to the ground, but the Divine Sorcerer did not take it. Instead, his eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p>Bazhun’an’s mouth twitched. He sighed. “Give me some face. I’m Bazhun’an.”</p><p>“Hey!” The Divine Sorcerer’s brows immediately relaxed and he clearly felt completely satisfied. “Today, I must give you Bazhun’an some face!”</p><p>He wanted to pull the excellent imitation of Bazhun’an over, but he was stopped in time by the excellent imitation of a Storyteller’s glare.</p><p>He was quite principled… He muttered, chuckled and then said.</p><p>“What ‘infiltration’? That’s too unpleasant to the ears.”</p><p>“Our Divine Sect has a history of over a thousand years. Half of the Divine Sorcerers in the Southern Region are our people, alright?”</p><p>“Heh.” The Storyteller sneered “Half of the Southern Region? You mean to say that the evil Divine Secrets of the various sects came from your sect’s teachings?”</p><p>“Of course!” The Divine Sorcerer was extremely proud.</p><p>“Who is your boss?” Bazhun’an asked.</p><p>The Divine Sorcerer immediately stopped talking. His lips were half-pursed, and he had a subtle smile on his face. He lowered his head and looked up quietly and his expression was filled with anticipation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
