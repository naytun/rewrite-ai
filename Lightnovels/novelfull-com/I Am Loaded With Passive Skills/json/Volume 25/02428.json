He actually turned a deaf ear to Bei Huai’s voice!</p><p>“Even the Ai dog dared to speak?”</p><p>“If he dares to come, I’ll kill him as well!”</p><p>Before Bei Huai could too think much about it, a loud bang sounded in front of him. The cold and heavy At the Gates of Hell descended from the sky again.</p><p>It separated the Yin from the Yang, and reversed the paths of both the spirit meat.</p><p>By the time Bei Huai heard these voices, The Divine, who was still taking pills, had long disappeared.</p><p>“Ho!”</p><p>A Hungry Ghost with a green face and sharp fangs emerged from the massive At the Gates of Hell!</p><p>Bei Huai’s pupils constricted. A punch that was almost as powerful as half of his soul body, was aimed at his head again.</p><p>“The Divine, are you really that arrogant?!”</p><p>It was purely by accident that he was heavily injured by the earlier sneak attack.</p><p>Now that Bei Huai was already on guard, even if Ai Cangsheng refused to shoot, how could he let this Hungry Ghost bully his soul body?</p><p>“Three Eras Prison Realm!”</p><p>He formed a seal with both hands and guided the Great Path of the soul body.</p><p>In an instant, three dark green oval worlds crashed down between the Hungry Ghost and Bei Huai’s soul body. They resembled meteorites that fell from the sky and formed a barrier.</p><p>This soul body world looked like a bubble illusion and was extremely fragile. However, it was actually the strongest defense against the attacks of the way of spirit and soul.</p><p>Each of the three worlds contained a complete soul body and the Holy Emperor’s law.</p><p>Once an ordinary person intruded, his soul body would sink into a sea of bitterness. He would not be able to comprehend the rules within for the rest of his life.</p><p>If one failed to comprehend it, it would be like how a Spiritual Cultivator couldn’t break through to the Holy Emperor in his lifetime. It would be impossible for him to transcend, and he wouldn’t be able to escape from the Three Eras Prison Realm.</p><p>But The Divine…</p><p>This Hungry Ghost didn’t even stop to think for a moment, and his footsteps didn’t slow down at all as he charged forward brazenly!</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>A dark green halo spread out, and the people of the Four Symbols Secret Realm looked up.</p><p>Bei Huai’s soul body trembled violently.</p><p>He was already injured, and his injuries were serious.</p><p>This Holy Emperor’s thought incarnation had originally only made preparations to deal with Greedy the Cat Spirit. It naturally didn’t have many methods to deal with the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>Now that he had forcefully carried out this extremely exhausting move, not only was his condition somewhat dispirited, Bei Huai suddenly had a bad feeling.</p><p>“Hungry Ghost Path!”</p><p>“No, impossible!”</p><p>Bei Huai shook his head. He seemed to have thought of something, then a mocking light appeared in his eyes.</p><p>In the presence of all the spectators.</p><p>After The Divine transformed into a Hungry Ghost and entered the Three Eras Prison Realm, he was like a human who had entered an extradimensional space. He became extremely small.</p><p>However, he was like a rabid dog as he charged forward.</p><p>The so-called laws of the Holy Emperor had transformed into morph forms. They wanted to block him, seduce him, and sink into him…</p><p>He ignored them all!</p><p>This Hungry Ghost tore with its claws and shattered the laws.</p><p>He grabbed the power of the soul body and the power of laws around him and stuffed them into his mouth. As he ran, he continuously stuffed and replenished the supply after he consumed them!</p><p>The power of a Holy Emperor’s soul body was so great that it could destroy the soul body of an ordinary demi-saint. In the eyes of the Hungry Ghost, it was like the most delicious meal.</p><p>His speed was extremely fast!</p><p>It was as if he had rushed from the White Tiger lineage to the Vermilion Bird lineage in an instant!</p><p>As soon as he entered the first realm of the Three Eras Prison Realm, The Divine dashed from west to east and ran and ate like a maniac.</p><p>In just a few Auras, Bei Huai’s soul body could no longer hold on.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The first realm of the Three Eras Prison Realm exploded.</p><p>The tiny Hungry Ghost’s body expanded in everyone’s sight, but it rushed into the second realm in an even more crazy manner…</p><p>He continued to run!</p><p>He continued to rip things apart!</p><p>He continued to devour!</p><p>He could have made a turn after he came out because Bei Huai was momentarily distracted.</p><p>He could definitely have used a roundabout method to avoid the second realm’s defense and go around Bei Huai’s side. This would have forced him to use a greater and more exhausting spiritual technique…</p><p>He did not!</p><p>He was The Divine!</p><p>The Divine only wanted to use the battle to nurture a battle!</p><p>“Rabid dog…”</p><p>At this moment, this word appeared in the minds of all the spectators.</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>What did it mean to break all the laws with one force!</p><p>This was really a Hungry Ghost. Just one glance at it made one feel extremely hungry!</p><p>The Three Eras Prison Realm was simply the most delicious thing in the world in its mouth!</p><p>Only Bei Huai knew how ridiculous this scene looked…</p><p>The Three Eras Prison Realm could be settled just by being eaten away.</p><p>However, the power of the Holy Emperor’s laws was something that even a soul body that was at the same level as Bei Huai would find difficult to digest.</p><p>This was just like…</p><p>A water-type Spiritual Cultivator that forcefully swallowed and digested the Water of Great Path?</p><p>An ant opened its mouth and ate up a mountain of swords and sabers that was piled up to the sky?</p><p>The leaf peeled off its thin body and filled it up with lava, storms, poison, and poisonous worms?</p><p>Bei Huai didn’t even know how to describe this scene.</p><p>He only knew what kind of torture the Hungry Ghost endured at this moment. It must be traumatic on the level of the soul body, a pain from the inside out…</p><p>But The Divine did not move at all!</p><p>His footsteps were so firm that even Bei Huai thought that the defense of the Three Eras Prison Realm was actually zero and that it had not caused any damage to The Divine!</p><p>“What had he experienced before?”</p><p>Bei Huai was stunned.</p><p>He had only met The Divine a few times in the War of the Ten High Nobles, but he had never really fought with him. Naturally, he had never experienced the power of the Hungry Ghost Path amid the Six Paths.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
