I successfully studied them while you were fighting.”</p><p>“A set of this sealing array, Boss, is for your use. It can seal all the fluctuations of your soul. Outsiders can’t use their Perception to see it. I need a drop of blood from Greedy the Cat Spirit.”</p><p>“Other than the owner of this blood who can ignore this array and control your soul body, I’ve already deduced the strength of the others, such as Bei Huai’s remnant soul. As long as you don’t have any soul body fluctuations, it can’t control you. If Bei Huai’s true body comes, just pretend I didn’t say anything.”</p><p>“In this way, as long as Greedy the Cat Spirit keeps casting the Three Loathsome Eyes at you, you can ignore the Spirit Awakening. You can maintain the Life Dao Disc and the state of the Unity of Heaven and Man to recover.”</p><p>This telepathic communication was equivalent to talking to oneself.</p><p>Jin Ren did not have any misgivings. He kept spouting Bei Huai’s name and was not afraid of being discovered.</p><p>“You’re amazing.”</p><p>Xu Xiashou praised him emotionlessly.</p><p>As expected of me, I’ve given it a lot of thought. I even considered the Spirit Awakening.</p><p>Without hesitation, he took a drop of blood from Greedy the Cat Spirit and weaved a Saint Stage spiritual array around himself.</p><p>Jin Ren did not dare to use the Divine Secret. He was afraid that Dao Qiongcang would suddenly enter and casually break his Divine Array.</p><p>“The second set is the ‘Circulation’ array. It’s for Greedy the Cat Spirit.”</p><p>“If you put it on its body, Greedy the Cat Spirit will be able to continue to use the Three Loathsome Eyes on you without being disturbed by external objects or external forces…”</p><p>“Boss, listen to my advice. Greedy the Cat Spirit is really unstable. I don’t know when its attention will be diverted. It could even be an alchemy cauldron.”</p><p>“Even a Saint Stage spiritual array isn’t very safe. A contract would be the safest option. I’m not joking.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed.</p><p>How could he not know this?</p><p>Jin Ren’s thoughts were actually equivalent to his own hidden thoughts, but he was just trying hard to block them out.</p><p>At this moment, Jin Ren was talking about it from a third person’s perspective.</p><p>This meant that the current situation was really critical and he needed to sign a contract with Greedy the Cat Spirit to protect himself.</p><p>“Little fat cat.”</p><p>“Can you do it?” The Ultimate Giant asked sincerely as he held Greedy the Cat Spirit that was like a mere speck of dust in his hand. “Control me with the Three Loathsome Eyes and maintain the order.”</p><p>“Meow?”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit didn’t understand, but it nodded.</p><p>“The situation is very dangerous now. If you don’t do it, I, your owner, will die. You won’t have anyone to protect you in the future. Do you understand?”</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit was shocked. It raised its paw and swore that it understood the seriousness of the matter.</p><p>“And if I die, or if you fail to maintain your ‘control’ over me…”</p><p>“You’ve seen it before. The other me will come over and sign a contract with you directly. We’ll become one.”</p><p>“This is the last resort!”</p><p>“You…” Xu Xiaoshou did not lie. “Do you want that to happen?” He threatened it seriously.</p><p>He pointed at the spatial fragment.</p><p>What he wanted to highlight was nothing more than the miserable state of the Holy Emperor Qilin after it was possessed by Bei Huai.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit glanced back and its eyes glowed faintly.</p><p>With its owner…</p><p>Become one…</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>The little white cat nodded vigorously and indicated that it was very willing.</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not say anything else and immediately put a Saint Stage spiritual array on this unreliable thing.</p><p>What was that meow!</p><p>How could it be like this? Did it learn this from Hidden Bitter?</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit didn’t even resist the Saint Stage spiritual array. It just sensed that its body felt strange and it couldn’t help but want to control its owner.</p><p>However, Greedy the Cat Spirit had seen all of his owner’s partiality.</p><p>“An owner who likes to be controlled…”</p><p>“It’s very strange, but it’s not impossible to understand…”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit was so happy that it didn’t choose to swallow the array patterns on its body.</p><p>It had long gained spiritual intelligence and knew that its master seemed to be very afraid that he would lose those array patterns.</p><p>However…</p><p>Its owner had clearly underestimated him.</p><p>It’s okay, just cooperate with me. Controlling the owner was also a new experience.</p><p>“Life Dao Disc…”</p><p>This Great Dao Disc mobilized all the life energy in the world and continued to operate. It would not stop even after Xu Xiaoshou fainted.</p><p>Jin Ren had actually considered everything thoroughly.</p><p>He suggested a contract with Greedy the Cat Spirit, because of Greedy the Cat Spirit’s robust ‘swallow” attribute.</p><p>However, if everything failed, he could also switch his will to control his main body and let his main body’s sleeping will go to sleep in his own body, so he did not try to persuade him.</p><p>This was the greatest benefit of the main body and the second true body being independent of each other. Many demi-saint incarnations couldn’t compare to this.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou naturally understood this.</p><p>If he fainted, his consciousness could be transferred to Jin Ren… It was just that he had a little bit of mysophobia in his heart that made him accept this second-hand preparation.</p><p>After all, Jin Ren had been contaminated before…</p><p>Even though he hadn’t self-destructed yet, there weren’t any other accidents, and he couldn’t detect anything unusual.</p><p>But what if?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was always on guard against Elder Dao the Flamboyant. He was afraid of death.</p><p>Whoosh!”</p><p>The telepathic communication between the Ultimate Giant and Jin Ren only took an instant.</p><p>In the eyes of the outside world, after the giant twisted and tore apart the Holy Emperor Qilin.</p><p>The people in the world below heard the obscure sound of the wind in the depths of their souls.</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin was thrown into the spatial fragment, but a wisp of its soul escaped from it.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>“How could this be?”</p><p>Ah Qi was Bei Huai’s Holy Emperor thought incarnation. He was invited by Dao Qiongcang to carry out a mission in the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
