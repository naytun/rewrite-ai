The others were not willing to provoke someone with such a strange ability.</p><p>He knew a thing or two about the Hungry Ghost Path, but that was all.</p><p>Because at that time, not many people could force The Divine to open the Six Paths, or even the special Hungry Ghost Path.</p><p>“This is an ancient martial art?”</p><p>The path of the soul body was just one of the many branches of the Way of Spiritual Cultivation. It specialized in the soul of the Spiritual Cultivator.</p><p>This ancient martial art was a Great Path that had appeared in ancient times. It was as famous as the Ancient Sword Technique and the Way of Spiritual Cultivation of today.</p><p>Bei Huai wasn’t surprised that The Divine, who might have inherited the complete heritage of the ancient martial arts, was able to display the power of the ancient martial God’s soul body to deal with him, who had the soul path and the Way of Spiritual Cultivation.</p><p>After his initial shock, he quickly calmed down and began to analyze The Divine’s condition from the perspective of a calm bystander.</p><p>Since Ai Cangsheng didn’t help, he had no choice but to be delayed.</p><p>The best way to solve the problem was to solve the problem as soon as possible and focus on Greedy the Cat Spirit. Bei Huai never blamed anyone.</p><p>“Very strong…”</p><p>“But he is also very weak…”</p><p>In seven auras, he broke the first realm of the Three Eras Prison Realm, and in eleven auras, he broke the second realm.</p><p>Twenty-three breaths had passed, but the third realm had not been broken yet.</p><p>“This isn’t The Divine.”</p><p>Bei Huai immediately came to a conclusion.</p><p>If it had been The Divine’s true body, he could break his form in ten auras back when he was part of the Ten High Nobles. After all, he was only a Holy Emperor’s thought incarnation.</p><p>How could he be held back by such a move for so long?</p><p>“Demi-saint Incarnation?”</p><p>“No, he’s not a Spiritual Cultivation demi-saint. He can’t create a demi-saint Incarnation.”</p><p>“However, he has far surpassed ordinary demi-saints in the path of ancient martial arts. He is similar to the incarnation of an ancient demi-saint…”</p><p>Bei Huai suddenly understood.</p><p>It was no wonder that The Divine needed to resist his Holy Emperor thought incarnation for so long. It turned out that the other side was not his true body.</p><p>“Since it is not the true body, everything will be easy…”</p><p>The focus of the battlefield was completely drawn over by The Divine’s craziness!</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou was shocked by the rabid fighting style of the Hungry Ghost. He watched nervously and expectantly as the fellow broke through the first realm, the second realm, and the third realm…</p><p>As for Bei Huai’s soul body, it was constantly being destroyed by the Three Eras Prison Realm and suffered a backlash.</p><p>Under this elimination, the situation of victory and defeat between the two seemed to become increasingly clear.</p><p>The Hungry Ghost finally finished its eating spree of the Three Eras Prison Realm. Its body size suddenly expanded, and its condition was pushed to its peak. It punched fiercely at Bei Huai’s soul body again.</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>As he stepped on the Spirit Dao Disc, Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was in his throat.</p><p>Of course, he studied his moves as he tried to steal from The Divine and replicate the powerful Hungry Ghost Path of the Six Paths.</p><p>When his gaze moved from the fists of the maniac Hungry Ghost to Bei Huai’s soul body, he could not help but tremble.</p><p>Bei Huai’s soul body aura boiled…</p><p>“He’s in deep thought!”</p><p>There was no doubt that Xu Xiaoshou found some clues when he compared himself to the others in the shattered world.</p><p>At the same time, when The Divine’s Hungry Ghost launched a punch, Xu Xiaoshou felt a rough aura enter his spiritual will.</p><p>“He’s analyzing me.”</p><p>It was The Divine’s voice!</p><p>In such a crazed and hungry state, The Divine was still able to maintain his rationality and was aware that Bei Huai had analyzed him?</p><p>This guy was very sensitive when it came to battles!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly became nervous. He wanted to do something.</p><p>However, this was a Saint War, a Saint War of the the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>Even if both parties were not in their original bodies, he was indeed too far away from the current battle. It was difficult for him not to get involved.</p><p>“Motherf*cker, why did it have to be Bei Huai who cultivated the soul body?”</p><p>“Even Wang Ze Sacred Emperor would be good. At least I, an Ultimate Giant, can fight him. I can even blow his head off!”</p><p>“Or, the Hungry Ghost Path…”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>An eye shattering punch was launched.</p><p>Bei Huai suffered from the backlash of the Three Eras Prison Realm. He did not even have the power to resist. The head of his soul body was shattered by the Hungry Ghost’s punch and was sent flying!</p><p>That huge force flung Bei Huai’s entire body upward. He was directly blasted out of the Four Symbols Secret Realm and into the sky above Gong Yang Mountain.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>Attracted by the aura of the Saint war, the higher void levels and the Cutting Path Stage from all over the Central Region looked up and saw the main character of the ceremony they wanted to watch.</p><p>“I want to cry…”</p><p>“No, what kind of ability is this?!”</p><p>In just an instant, when they saw the Saint, tears flowed from everyone’s eyes, and a bad feeling rose in their hearts.</p><p>Was this really a battle that could be ‘watched’?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a step forward and left the battlefield of the Four Symbols Secret Realm. In an instant, he arrived in the sky above Gong Yang Mountain.</p><p>“Lord Shou?”</p><p>“Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>He did not hide his aura at all when he appeared.</p><p>Therefore, even if he had the Stealth ability, it was still very eye-catching in the eyes of the vigilant Cutting Path Stage and higher void level.</p><p>Who was that soul body that was blasted out? Wasn’t it too powerful to be blasted by Lord Shou?”</p><p>“Wuuu… Wait, this ability to make people cry reminds me of…”</p><p>Before they could think too much, they saw another huge Hungry Ghost emerge from the space crack after the decapitated soul body was blasted out.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The Hungry Ghost’s scream was too brutal!</p><p>Everyone was shocked and their bodies froze, but they saw an even more violent scene:</p><p>As soon as the Hungry Ghost appeared, sharp and blood-red claws extended from its ten fingers. They stabbed into the decapitated soul body and tore it apart!</p><p>“Bei Huai!”</p><p>“Bei Huai of the the Ten High Nobles?!”</p><p>The higher void level who watched the battle came to this conclusion.</p><p>Under the force of the ripping, the broken decapitated soul body was completely shredded into countless pieces.</p><p>The Hungry Ghost stretched out its claws, swept up everything, stuffed it into its mouth and swallowed…</p><p>After the burly soul body was dismembered, it was meticulously devoured by the Hungry Ghost.</p><p>“Burp!”</p><p>When the burp sounded, the tears of the Cutting Path Stage and the higher void levels also stopped flowing.</p><p>The world seemed to have been paused, and everyone’s thoughts froze.</p><p>At this moment, the only thing they were sure of was…</p><p>“The one who was eaten was definitely not Bei Huai!”</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>The At the Gates of Hell fell from the sky.</p><p>The Hungry Ghost fell into its midst and turned into a bald man who walked out from the other side with a solemn expression.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>Everyone whose thoughts had frozen suddenly felt their thoughts start to boil.</p><p>“At the Gates to Hell?”</p><p>“He, he’s The Divine?!”</p><p>The Divine ignored the people around him and landed beside Xu Xiaoshou. He flipped his hand and presented the remaining four Soul Holy Medicine with an extremely serious expression.</p><p>“He’s too weak. He’s not the main body…”</p><p>“Also, we’re in big trouble!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
