It was fine as long as they were enough for everyone.</p><p>After all…</p><p>A demi-saint with incomplete Spatial Upanishad was something that everyone wanted to kill before it happened.</p><p>However, if he was formed, no one would want to oppose him. Even the Saint Emperor aristocratic families would have to rope him in!</p><p>This was Ye Xiaotian’s confidence!</p><p>But now…</p><p>Azure Finger?</p><p>The Holy Emperor attacked directly. Was Rao Wangze crazy?</p><p>“I have never offended the Holy Emperor Rao…”</p><p>“I’ve taken care of Rao Yinyin for so many years. Holy Emperor Wang Ze should know who’s surnamed Xu and who’s surnamed Ye…”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>In just a breath.</p><p>The shield formed by the sky of the Central Yuan world collapsed.</p><p>When Xuan Wuyi saw the Azure Finger, he already knew something.</p><p>After all, he had followed Bazhun’an and had gone through the event at Abyss Island once, so he knew that Wang Ze the Holy Emperor had made a move.</p><p>As for why he attacked…</p><p>It was very simple!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s trap not only had Holy Emperor Bei Huai, but also Holy Emperor Wangze.</p><p>It should be said that Holy Emperor Wang Ze was the easiest to invite. Bei Huai’s appearance was just an accident. The latter did not care about the war between the Holy Divine Palace and the Sacred Servant. He only cared about the ghost beasts. However, if he appeared at that time, he would definitely be used by Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>And Rao Yaoyao died in Xu Xiaoshou’s hands…</p><p>Holy Emperor Wangze had been crippled by Xu Xiaoshou, who was supported by the power of the Four Divine Pillars, so a wisp of his consciousness had been swallowed by Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison.</p><p>This hatred would never disappear!</p><p>Xuan Wuji’s brain worked too fast, and he understood everything in an instant.</p><p>The only thing he did not understand was…</p><p>“If Holy Emperor Wang Ze was already invited, why did he only act now?”</p><p>“He should be targeting Xu Xiaoshou! Even if he didn’t join forces with Bei Huai to bully Ye Xiaotian, he should have appeared immediately when Xu Xiaoshou was weakened. Why would he come out and target Ye Xiaotian?”</p><p>There was no time to think.</p><p>He didn’t have time to explain to the dwarf in his arms.</p><p>Taking advantage of the moment when the Hand of Ripping Heaven blocked the Azure Finger, Patriarch Wuji hugged Ye Xiaotian tightly, as if he was holding onto his last life-saving straw.</p><p>“I’m counting on you, Brother Ye!”</p><p>He crushed the fixed-point teleportation portal wheel. With a buzz, the space nodes stored in the array wheel in advance, as well as the Divine Path Principles and Holy Power, covered him.</p><p>The Azure Finger came too quickly and too abruptly!</p><p>The distance between Xuan Wuji and Ye Xiaotian was so close that it was as if they were worlds apart. He did not even dare to get close to Ye Xiaotian, afraid that he would waste any time.</p><p>Similarly, this was also the reason why Ye Xiaotian could only block the attack and not turn around and flee. If he were to expose his back to the Holy Emperor’s finger, his Spatial Upanishad would be destroyed!</p><p>However, the Hand of Ripping Heaven was able to block it for a moment. Now that the situation was completely different, Xuan Wuji had to choose to hug the dwarf.</p><p>After being cleared by Holy Emperor Wang Ze to the point where only wind elements were left, Xuan Wuji used Divine Secret to store the space nodes in advance. These nodes were useless to others, but to a demi-saint with Spatial Upanishad, it was the best way to escape.</p><p>Even though Ye Xiaotian had blocked the attack and all his bones were broken, nearly causing him to fall from his demi-saint cultivation state, he did not die on the spot. Instead, he borrowed the force of the recoil to get closer to Xuan Wuji. It was precisely because he knew that Xuan Wuji was a Divine Sorcerer that he would always have a life-saving Teleportation Portal Wheel on hand, which had space nodes that he could use.</p><p>A great disaster was imminent, and one’s life was difficult to protect.</p><p>The two demi-saints had only met once before, so they didn’t know each other’s methods. Now, however, they had a tacit understanding of each other, almost like an old couple who had been loving each other for many years.</p><p>The Azure Finger was about to land on Ye Xiaotian’s face again, but before it could do so, the power of the Teleportation Portal Wheel wrapped around Ye Xiaotian and sent him away.</p><p>Because the space was fluctuating wildly, the fixed-point teleportation became a random teleportation.</p><p>When the people below looked up, they saw that the Azure Finger had broken through two afterimages and disappeared into the sky.</p><p>However, that finger had locked onto its target!</p><p>“I’m finished, I’m finished…”</p><p>Xuan Wuji hugged the white-haired Daoist child tightly, not daring to let go at all.</p><p>The Holy Emperor’s finger followed behind him into the spatial fragment. He had never felt death so close before.</p><p>Amidst the chaotic space fragment, the storm raged, and the wind element increased.</p><p>Clearly, the destination of the random teleportation was not right.</p><p>“Where will we be sent to?”</p><p>When the demi-saint spoke during the light-speed space jump, Xuan Wuji was obviously panicking in the telepathic communication</p><p>“Where else can we go? It must be the Wu Rao Emperor Realm!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian spat out a mouthful of blood as soon as he spoke. However, he suddenly felt a sweet taste in his mouth as he was fed God’s Blessing.</p><p>“Can you change it?” Xuan Wuji could only rejoice that he was holding onto a Spatial Upanishad instead of a Water-type Upanishad. Otherwise, their bodies would have turned cold.</p><p>“Nonsense. Do you think Spatial Upanishad is just a decoration?”</p><p>God’s Blessing was indeed powerful. Soon, Ye Xiaotian, who was heavily injured, was able to move a wisp of holy essence around his energy reserve.</p><p>“Where are we going? We can’t go to the Jade Capital!” Xuan Wuji had no choice but to remind Ye Xiaotian, fearing that he would still remember the mission he had mentioned earlier and that he would be loyal to Bazhun’an even if he had to die.</p><p>“Of course, we can’t go to the Jade Capital. If we go now, aren’t we courting death?”</p><p>Why would Ye Xiaotian go to Jade Capital City?</p><p>He had only met Bazhun’an three times, they were acquaintance. That was all!</p><p>The speed of the space jump was too fast.</p><p>Even the Holy Emperor’s finger could only follow, unable to surpass.</p><p>After Ye Xiaotian mobilized his Holy Power, the Upanishad Formation beneath his feet spun, and he anchored himself to one of the most familiar nodes in his life, allowing him to escape from the spatial fragment.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The lightning flashed and shocked Xuan Wuji, thinking that someone was transcending the tribulation again.</p><p>After leaving the space fragment, he looked up. There was a mountain in front of him that reached into the clouds. The thunder calamity on the mountain was endless.</p><p>It wasn’t the Nine Death Thunder Calamity, nor was it the demi-saint tribulation or the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation…</p><p>“Elixirs Tribulation?”</p><p>Xuan Wuji was very experienced and recognized the tribulation.</p><p>At the same time, he also recognized this mountain. It should be called “four-hill mountain”.</p><p>On the four-hill mountain.</p><p>The sky quickly turned green!</p><p>Ye Xiaotian took a deep breath and channeled his Holy Power to the maximum before bellowing,</p><p>“Ye Xiaotian, a student of the Holy Palace, has returned from the Upanishad sanctification!”</p><p>“Old turtle Wei An, open the door for the demi-saint!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
