He had learned how to cut off The Divine’s escape route.</p><p>However, to enter the Hungry Ghost Path, the first step was to form a contract and summon the ghost gate!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not turn into the ancient martial arts genius The Divine at this moment and get an insight into such a ridiculous thing casually.</p><p>He could only look for a substitute.</p><p>Therefore…</p><p>In his mind, all the Three Thousand Ways of the Ancient Sword Technique appeared.</p><p>After that, the summoning technique of the gates of hell that Master Siren had displayed when he slashed Jiang Buyi with his sword, appeared.</p><p>“Use the sword to form an array and use the array to summon the ghosts!”</p><p>There was no need for a contract to summon the At the Gates of Hell to provide a channel for the ancient martial arts the Hungry Ghost Path, and then to turn into a path of the ghost transformation.</p><p>This was the path that Xu Xiaoshou had come up with that belonged solely to him!</p><p>The three ways of Spiritual Cultivation, ancient martial arts, and Ancient Sword Technique!</p><p>“This sword technique is famous. It’s called Nine..”</p><p>In the void, the destructive light and the Weeping Blood Shahua clashed against each other. Suddenly, a wave of decadent Taoist music rang out.</p><p>At a glance, the Ultimate Giant was still in his giant form, but a small black sword that trembled crazily appeared behind him.</p><p>It was extremely inconspicuous, but at this moment, it was extremely eye-catching!</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>“An Ancient Sword Technique?”</p><p>“That sword, I recognize that sword! Wasn’t it one of the sabers that the Saint Servant Lord Shou had on his arrest warrant? I heard that it’s a grade one spiritual sword…”</p><p>“Hidden Bitter? Or Fourth Sword?”</p><p>“No, how is that possible! Doesn’t that mean that giant is really Lord Shou?”</p><p>“Was it really Xu Xiaoshou who beat up the Holy Emperor?”</p><p>The Ultimate Giant was too big!</p><p>It was not just the Central Yuan world. The people in the Qilin world also heard the sound that came from the Ancient Sword Technique and the Taoist music from Xu Xiaoshou’s force.</p><p>There were few swordsmen in the Central Region, and even fewer ancient swordsmen.</p><p>However, this did not mean that there were no swordsmen.</p><p>On the contrary, there were very few people in the capital who worshipped the Seven Sword Deity and the Eighth Sword Deity. There were many people in the two worlds.</p><p>“Ancient Sword Technique…”</p><p>At this moment, countless swordsmen from the two worlds became excited. Their sabers buzzed as if they wanted to ride the wind.</p><p>“Why does this sound like the legendary Eighth Sword Deity raising his sword?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou’s Ancient Sword Technique is so powerful that it can cause the swords of a city to quiver?”</p><p>“A city? I’m afraid that it’s not just White Moon City. The Power Upanishad Formation under the giant’s feet covers an area of two worlds. All kinds of spiritual swords are calling for it!”</p><p>“Witness Sword Technique…This is ‘sword cognition’! He really is the Hua Lai Bei Tian Yin Shou- that Lord Shou!”</p><p>The Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation expanded at the same time as the Ultimate Giant.</p><p>Xu Xishou entered the Unity of Man and Heavens state and imitated Master Siren’s sword attack.</p><p>“The sword technique is famous. It’s called nine…”</p><p>“The Nine Paths is infinite. Set the array here and open the ghost gate!”</p><p>Whoosh whoosh…</p><p>When the Taoist music had completely settled.</p><p>Not only did Hidden Bitter fly out from behind the giant, but there was also Flame Python, Fourth Sword, and even other grade two and three spiritual swords.</p><p>At this point, the people of the Qilin world and the Central Yuan world were almost completely certain:</p><p>He was the new Sword Deity, Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“Nine Swords Technique, the first realm…”</p><p>The Spiritual swordsmen were overwhelmed with emotion.</p><p>The ancient swordsmen were fascinated.</p><p>Too many people could tell what Xu Xiaoshou’s move was at a glance.</p><p>Use the illusion of the sword to transform infinity into an array, lead the way to the underworld and summon the ghost gate.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>When the Nine Swords stopped in the air.</p><p>Below the Three Heavens, beside the Weeping Blood Shahua, a sinister and cold form of the gates of hell rose.</p><p>The door was extremely heavy and was fastened with black iron chains.</p><p>The Ultimate Giant’s sword finger drew a line, and the gates of hell opened.</p><p>“Wuwuwu…”</p><p>The evil spirits within howled loudly.</p><p>The dead souls of the two worlds that had died in the battle seemed to have found their homes and fused into the army of this illusory and transparent thing.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Below the Three Heavens, Bei Huai’s will could not make any sound at all.</p><p>He knew exactly what Xu Xiaoshou wanted to do at this moment. This guy wanted to enter the Hungry Ghost Path.</p><p>He wanted to reverse the destiny!</p><p>“Die…”</p><p>The Three-day Soul Shifting teleportation portal was in complete chaos.</p><p>Bei Huai’s will went completely berserk, and three more beams of destructive light shot out from the array and hit the Weeping Blood Shahua.</p><p>The Weeping Blood Shahua suddenly collapsed and vanished totally.</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was like a kite on a string that had broken off. She drew a parabola in the sky and smashed against the Ultimate Giant behind her.</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit remembered the aura of this female owner.</p><p>Back in the Yuan Mansion, she had given it a lot of delicious food, all of which were filled with vitality spiritual energy.</p><p>At this moment, the little fat cat started to repay its gratitude. It jumped over hurriedly, opened its mouth, and swallowed its female owner’s body. Then, it hurriedly returned to its owner’s side and avoided the direct attack of the destructive light.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>The destructive lights broke through the shackles, and two of them blasted towards the gates of hell, while the other blasted towards the Ultimate Giant.</p><p>The scene seemed to be unstoppable.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>At this moment, a Power Upanishad Formation appeared in the sky.</p><p>The space began to ripple, and the world started to fold. The destructive light was clearly about to hit the gates of hell and the Ultimate Giant.</p><p>At this moment, it was as if it was so close, yet worlds apart and was unable to advance an inch!</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Bei Huai’s will completely exploded.</p><p>Another Power Upanishad Formation, yet another one who wanted to provoke the Holy Emperor?</p><p>Had this world gone crazy? It seemed that the Power Upanishad Formations were free and Xu Xiaoshou had a handful of them. Now, there was another one as dazzling as the other one?</p><p>“What happened…”</p><p>The people below couldn’t understand either.</p><p>Those three destructive lights were actually blocked by the spatial fold?</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“This was not any ordinary spatial fold!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
