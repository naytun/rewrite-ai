She felt that she had passed through the passage of the Four Symbols Secret Realm and was in the outside world. Soon, she would be able to join the battlefield.</p><p>When she looked up, she realized that she was still in the same spot, still in the Vermilion Bird lineage!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s solemn voice sounded in her ears.</p><p>“Everyone, stand by. Anyone who disobeys will die.”</p><p>“Three days to move the soul!”</p><p>In the sky above the Central Yuan world, Bei Huai’s remnant soul had completely burned itself out and had also gone stark raving mad.</p><p>Just now, he had received a vague will from the white-robed, barefooted Bei Huai that he had sent over with great difficulty-Teleportation!</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit could be ignored.</p><p>He had to move Xu Xiaoshou’s soul body into the Mournful Emperor realm!</p><p>In his current state, how could he use any spiritual technique, let alone move Xu Xiaoshou’s soul?</p><p>If he wanted to get this person back…</p><p>Ah Qi realized that he was not Bei Huai after all. He was just a strand of Bei Huai.</p><p>He couldn’t refuse his main body’s orders.</p><p>His only choice was to do a soul sacrifice to obtain temporary peak power like the Holy Emperor Qilin.</p><p>After that, he would give up on himself and he foresaw that he would have no future. He could only complete the white-robed, barefooted Bei Huai’s mission.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>A shrill and resentful sound echoed all around the void.</p><p>Ah Qi’s thoughts fluctuated wildly, but he did not care at all!</p><p>He was not afraid of death, so what was there to hide?</p><p>However, at the same time…</p><p>He was not the only one. Even the people in the world below saw the Ultimate Giant’s fingers move. It seemed as if something had appeared, but it also seemed as if it had not.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Ah Qi was stunned.</p><p>It felt a little familiar. He seemed to have seen it somewhere before.</p><p>Staff?</p><p>“Boss!”</p><p>Jin Ren could sense that the Ultimate Giant held the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff again, and his scalp turned cold.</p><p>In such a weak state, he still dared to use the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff?</p><p>This thing was called the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff, but it was actually the ‘Staff of Death’!</p><p>Abyss Island relied on the power of the Holy Emperor and the Four Divine Pillars to control many demi-saints and even Wang Ze Holy Emperor.</p><p>The Four Symbols Secret Realm relied on the power of the Heavenly Ancestor and Dragon Ancestor to turn the tables for the second time around in front of Bei Huai.</p><p>And now…</p><p>There was nothing!</p><p>He used the Human Realm Dao, he used the Ultimate Giant and he used the Moment of Enlightenment..</p><p>It could be said that the original body was drained dry.</p><p>If he were to use the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff now, it would not be a matter whether he would be in a coma for one day or three days.</p><p>One year, three years?</p><p>He could even die of exhaustion on the spot!</p><p>“Even the Life Dao Disc can’t save you.”</p><p>“The Unity of Man and the Heavens is not omnipotent… Boss!”</p><p>Jin Ren shouted at the top of his lungs.</p><p>However, he was only a wisp of Xu Xiaoshou, so he could not go against the original body’s decision.</p><p>“Have you decided?”</p><p>“I’ve decided.”</p><p>“Even if you don’t die, you will be targeted by the Holy Emperor. As for the Holy Emperor…”</p><p>“I understand. I know the Holy Emperor aristocratic family better than you do.”</p><p>On a desolate land at the edge of the Qilin world, the ground was dry and cracked. It was filled with the remnants of the post war aura. There was not even a trace of life.</p><p>Two tall figures stood at the edge of the cliff. In this desolate and uninhabited land, they faced the biting cold wind and looked at the Ultimate Giant in the distance.</p><p>He wore an orange robe, a hood, and an orange mask. Not a single blade of grass grew under his feet.</p><p>She was dressed in a black robe with a hood that hung behind her back. It revealed three thousand silver strands that cascaded to her waist. The strands emitted melodious sounds in the wind. She did not wear a mask, and held a black faceless mask tightly in her hand.</p><p>The remnant soul was ignited.</p><p>The giant held a staff.</p><p>The two figures dressed in long robes spoke in the cold bleak wind.</p><p>“You should know that I will not attack. This is not the time…” The orange-robed man sighed. “I can’t, and I’m unwilling to. I’ll only replace it with a wisp of my soul.”</p><p>The tall black-robed figure was calm and composed, but his eyes swiveled rapidly and stirred up sparks of black and white mist.</p><p>She jumped out without hesitation.</p><p>On the edge of the cliff, the relatively dead and extremely seductive black and white Reborn Lily bloomed.</p><p>“It’s okay, I’ll do it.”</p><p>“I’m already alone.”</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>In the dark, the people of the Qilin world and the Central Yuan world suddenly heard three loud bangs.</p><p>Shocked, they saw the power of the Holy Emperor’s soul body that swept across the sky and divided the sky into three layers.</p><p>The lower echelon was turbid.</p><p>The middle echelon was the world.</p><p>The upper echelons were clear.</p><p>Between the three echelons, there was a passageway that was accessible, but no one knew where it led to.</p><p>However, there was no need to think about what to do. Just the appearance of the three layered sky caused the people of the two worlds to prostrate on the ground.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>All the Spiritual Cultivators below were terrified.</p><p>It was all gone! Even his remnant soul had been obliterated!</p><p>All of a sudden, he could erupt with such a mighty force and even tamper with the two worlds to create such a phenomenon…This was the Holy Emperor?</p><p>“Three days to move the soul, clear and turbid sent to the world!”</p><p>Bei Huai’s remnant soul had been destroyed, and what was burning was the last bit of his will.</p><p>He could tell what the Ultimate Giant held in its hand.</p><p>The Time Ancestor Shadow Staff that had appeared twice and that he had forgotten about came from that d*mned Kong Yuhen!</p><p>But he couldn’t think too much about it.</p><p>At this moment, his only hope was that Xu Xiaoshou was too sluggish and could not use the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff.</p><p>Even if he could use it, he would not be able to break through the power of the Heaven and Earth teleportation that he had sacrificed everything to construct!</p><p>“Quite… strong…”</p><p>The Ultimate Giant gripped the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff tightly. He could not stop Bei Huai’s soul sacrifice. He was only shocked by the power that had opened up the world.</p><p>The lessons of the past are the lessons of the future.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
