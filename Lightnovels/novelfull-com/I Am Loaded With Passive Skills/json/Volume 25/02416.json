After a long time, she finally said, “It’s over?”</p><p>“What do you mean by ‘it’s over?’ Xiangxiang rolled her eyes.</p><p>“It usually takes, at least…” Yan’er gestured wildly. Finally, she mumbled, “It would take at least fifteen minutes, right?”</p><p>Xiangxiang was stunned for a moment before she finally reacted. She snapped, “What were you thinking about? Your mind is filled with filth. The virtual image can’t make any moves!”</p><p>“Ah?” Yan’er was even more shocked when she heard that. She held her head and looked at the extremely weak Xiangxiang. Her brain seemed to be on fire.</p><p>The virtual image couldn’t move, that was…</p><p>She calmed her thoughts and noticed the blood stain on Xiangxiang’s chest. “What’s this?”</p><p>“Oh, I’m fine. I injured myself just now.” Xiangxiang spread her hands and had no intention to explain.</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>Yan’er immediately backed down and her big eyes almost popped out.</p><p>It, it could hurt one’s chest?</p><p>Playing to this extent?</p><p>Vermilion Bird lineage, Vermilion Bird Golden Tower.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who could not defeat him, chose to shake him off. He did not wait to get the support of the super beast.</p><p>His Disillusionment Finger had only managed to leave a small wound on Bei Huai’s soul body and interrupted his actions in the Apricot Realm.</p><p>After a short pause.</p><p>In the Apricot Realm, the dark green hand of the soul body reached down again and grabbed Greedy the Cat Spirit.</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit let out a panic-stricken scream.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had no other choice but to believe that Aunt Xiang’s support would arrive in time.</p><p>However, the short process to summon someone through the Summoning Technique and the process of the person’s arrival and departure through the Human Realm Dao and the journey after…</p><p>At this moment, it seemed that it had been an extremely long time!</p><p>“Hurry up…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was anxious. He used his identity as master of the Apricot Realm and directly escaped into the Apricot Realm.</p><p>The Apricot Realm had been completely sealed by the two hands of the soul body. Other than the Dragon Apricot and Xu Xiaoshou, no one could enter or exit from this place.</p><p>Drag it out!</p><p>The only thing left to do now was to let it drag on.</p><p>The situation might change if they delayed until The Divine arrived. If they could not delay, then there was only one last method left!</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The Berserk Giant faced the dark green soul body’s hands in the Apricot Realm and completed its transformation.</p><p>In the next moment, Xu Xiaoshou swallowed almost all the spiritual source in the Apricot Realm and pushed the awakened skill to the limit.</p><p>“Moment of Enlightenment!”</p><p>“Ultimate Giant!”</p><p>The two major awakenings suddenly opened.</p><p>All the strength in his body seemed to have been depleted in an instant.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou even released the Heavenly Ancestor’s Power in the Dragon Pearl and braced himself.</p><p>The Ultimate Giant, that contained a trace of rationality, finally appeared in the Apricot Realm. It faced the hands of the soul body that was above its head and struck out with its fists.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The space was completely shattered.</p><p>However, the hands of the soul body did not seem to be affected as it clashed with the Ultimate Giant’s fists.</p><p>The physical body and soul were like the two worlds of Yin and Yang and would never meet.</p><p>“Dragon Apricot!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou ignited all his power, not to block the soul body’s hands, but to open the Apricot Realm that was sealed in the spatial passageway.</p><p>He called out, and the Dragon Apricot immediately connected with him. It separated its branches and directly stabbed the Ultimate Giant’s shoulders as it crazily absorbed its strength.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Apricot Realm shook.</p><p>Amid the spacetime debris, the soul body’s huge hands that held on to the Dragon Apricot temporarily bounced off as it was deflected by its surge of power.</p><p>He made use of this opportunity, just as the soul hands were about to grab Greedy the Cat Spirit and the spatial passageway opened in advance.</p><p>“Meow?”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit felt its vision turn blurry and the environment around it changed.</p><p>Its eyes swept across the area…</p><p>So many people!</p><p>The surrounding battlefield was littered with inverted towers. There were also many humans as young as its owner and there was also…</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit trembled in fear.</p><p>The aura of the huge soul body in the void that had a smile on its lips was exactly the same as the soul body that wanted to take it down!</p><p>On top of the Vermilion Bird Golden Tower, Yu Zhiwen looked at Xu Xiaoshou who had suddenly disappeared and the little white cat who had suddenly appeared. She sensed the faint aura of a ghost beast and realized something.</p><p>Her Pearl Gem Star Eyes spun out. When she looked at the void again, she saw a huge divine soul body that surged out from under the Path Principles.</p><p>This was…</p><p>The sad Holy Emperor?</p><p>“I’m finally out!”</p><p>Bei Huai smiled and stared at Greedy the Cat Spirit as if it was a rare treasure.</p><p>When she saw this, Yu Zhiwen finally understood why Xu Xiaoshou had suddenly appeared.</p><p>The sad Holy Emperor’s target was the cat…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was also protecting the cat.</p><p>This was a cat fight!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen clenched her fists tightly, her eyes filled with worry.</p><p>No matter how strong Xu Xiaoshou was, how could he defeat the Holy Emperor? He would die!</p><p>What should I do?</p><p>How can I help him…</p><p>No!</p><p>What was I thinking of?</p><p>I’m a member of the Holy Divine Palace!</p><p>I shouldn’t think in this way. I should be on the sad Holy Emperor’s side. What I should deal with is… Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Buzz! Yu Zhiwen felt as if she had been struck by lightning, and her mind went blank.</p><p>“Am I Xu Xiaoshou’s enemy?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen had already thought of this when she vied for the position of division Chief.</p><p>However, when the scene that she had imagined appeared before her eyes so quickly, Yu Zhiwen lost her sense of propriety and didn’t know what to do.</p><p>How could she have thought of such a thing in advance?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen had mixed feelings.</p><p>She looked at the little white cat and then at the sad Holy Emperor. Her fingernails dug into her palms, but she did not feel the pain.</p><p>Having to choose was akin to tossing a coin. When time was pressing and the coin was tossed into the air, there was actually no need to wait for the result. The person already had the answer.</p><p>Suddenly, Yu Zhiwen’s mind went blank and her memories changed into an illusion.</p><p>On one side was her Supreme Master Dao Xuanji. She had followed his teachings since she was young and he demanded perfection.</p><p>However, the extreme oppression made it difficult for people to breathe. They even needed to escape the Saint mountain and take a breather outside before they could find themselves.</p><p>On the other hand, it was the carefree days at the White Cave at that time. It was the peace of mind under the protection of the Golden Giant. It was the trust and need, not the constant denial and always being told, ‘You can do better, don’t stop now.”</p><p>But…</p><p>The beautiful scene changed.</p><p>When Lu Ke’s body emitted the ghost beast aura, when Xu Xiaoshou looked at her and questioned her, but she could not say a word, his eyes suddenly turned unfamiliar and suspicious.</p><p>That kind of heart-wrenching pain, that kind of icy coldness, that kind of instant distance, that kind of mistrust…</p><p>Yu Zhiwen closed her eyes in pain.</p><p>She did not want to experience this feeling again.</p><p>She had already regretted it for too many nights, and she had already decided that if she could turn back time, if there was a second chance for her.</p><p>In this life, she definitely could not miss a second time!</p><p>“I’m sorry, Supreme Master. I also desire freedom…”</p><p>The thousands of images in her mind finally boiled down to one sentence that suddenly popped out. It came from Hallmaster Dao’s inexplicable exhortation not long ago.</p><p>“Follow your heart and pay attention to your safety.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen suddenly opened her eyes, and a burst of bright starlight erupted from them. There was disbelief and incomparable determination.</p><p>She leaped out of the Vermilion Bird Golden Tower that was stuck upside down on the ground. A breeze blew and starlight danced about.</p><p>At this moment, the Heavens and Earth seemed play a poem called ‘Error’.</p><p>How could the Vermilion Bird Golden Tower be stuck upside down on the ground?</p><p>How could the Holy Palace Trial be held at the same time as the Ran Ming ruins?</p><p>The trial-takers were right here. How could the Holy Emperor transcend the rules and fight in the Shengshen Continent and cause such misery and suffering?</p><p>Everyone erred. Why should I pursue perfection and propriety?</p><p>Why should I?</p><p>Can’t I make a sound?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen leaped into the air and her eyes widened as she shouted.</p><p>“Senior Bei Huai, why are you here?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
