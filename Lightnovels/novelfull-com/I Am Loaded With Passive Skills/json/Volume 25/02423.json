In the face of impending death, was it truly a triumph of the spirit?</p><p>“Why close the door?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled in response, remaining silent.</p><p>He wanted to say those words, but this was enough for now, at least he wouldn’t be held accountable by someone later.</p><p>Bei Huai looked at the young man, who had mastered the art of pretense, as he leaned against the back of the throne, his hands folded on the armrest, eyes closed, seemingly lost in a dreamland, ignoring Bei Huai completely.</p><p>He was truly angry.</p><p>Even the Ten High Nobles and Bazhun’an hadn’t been as pretentious as him!</p><p>Awaiting death in such a grandiose manner, he stood unparalleled in the world. He would seal his fate!</p><p>“Hand of the Divine Soul.”</p><p>Bei Huai slapped out a palm, blasting towards Xu Xiaoshou, who had completely given up resistance and only wanted to shine his last light on the throne, calmly meeting his end.</p><p>“Bang…”</p><p>A strange sound came from the distant northwest.</p><p>Very faint, but in the midst of this silent and attention-grabbing battle, it sounded piercing.</p><p>“Bang, bang, bang…”</p><p>As the Hand of the Divine Soul directly struck Xu Xiaoshou, someone couldn’t help but turn their head to see, trying to figure out what had caused the explosions.</p><p>“Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang…”</p><p>The sound of explosions approached from afar, rapidly transitioning from a distant rumble to a nearby roar, until suddenly, they were right before everyone’s eyes, finally erupting onto the battlefield.</p><p>On the throne, Xu Xiaoshou, who was resting his eyes and silently counting time, couldn’t sit still anymore.</p><p>Even if he would be held accountable later!</p><p>Even if it would lead to adverse consequences!</p><p>Today, he would keep up his showiness to the end, and give this damned Bei Huai a head-on blow!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou abruptly rose from the throne, directly confronting the Hand of the Divine Soul. Without making any attempt to defend himself, he simply stared at Holy Emperor Bei Huai. He shook his head and said in a very indifferent tone:</p><p>“You wouldn’t understand…”</p><p>“Close the door, release The Divine!”</p><p>At that moment, the world fell completely silent.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s voice was very soft, as if murmuring to himself, yet it seemed too loud, amplified by Holy Power, reaching Bei Huai’s ears.</p><p>Even the spiritual cultivators watching below could hear it.</p><p>Suddenly!</p><p>A savage figure intercepted from the side of the throne, rushing into the mighty Hand of the Divine Soul.</p><p>Yes!</p><p>He went in!</p><p>Invincible, unstoppable!</p><p>Under the horrified gaze of the crowd, the savage man pierced through the dense Hand of the Divine Soul, destroying everything in an instant, and then bursting out from behind.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A strange roar exploded in the souls of everyone, causing ringing in their ears and dizziness.</p><p>But as everyone strained to look, they saw a burly figure, almost blurred, leaving behind endless afterimages, rushing not only through the Hand of the Divine Soul but also towards Bei Huai’s soul body with force.</p><p>“What is this…”</p><p>Bei Huai’s soul body couldn’t help but widen his pupils, recognizing the newcomer.</p><p>His attention was originally all on Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>This person went from invisible to appearing, and his aura was hidden too well…</p><p>No!</p><p>Not a coincidence!</p><p>This was cooperation!</p><p>In perfect coordination, one concealed while the other deliberately drew his attention without a word exchanged between them.</p><p>“The Divine?!”</p><p>At that moment, the fluctuations of Bei Huai’s soul body completely boiled over.</p><p>His emotions erupted like a volcano, and his face was full of disbelief.</p><p>The Divine, trapped at the crossroads, appeared before his eyes.</p><p>Did Dao Qiongcang gouge Ai Cangsheng’s eyes out?!</p><p>“The Divine?!”</p><p>“Who’s The Divine?!”</p><p>“Oh, come on! Who else could it be?! There’s only one ‘At the Gates of Hell, even The Divine is revered!’”</p><p>The spectators watching the trial were also completely stirred up, each one exclaiming in shock.</p><p>What kind of scene is this?</p><p>The War of the Ten High Nobles?</p><p>…</p><p>The Divine was too fast!</p><p>He was so fast that his body arrived even before his voice!</p><p>From the moment he appeared beyond the battlefield to his arrival before Bei Huai’s soul body…</p><p>With a bang.</p><p>The heavens and the earth shook.</p><p>Ghostly energy dispersed from all directions, forming a vast gate filled with evil, cold, eerie, ancient, and heavy atmosphere—the Gate of Hell.</p><p>Connecting the Heavenly Court above and the Nine Serenities below.</p><p>Inverting yin and yang, alternating between spirit and flesh.</p><p>As a tiny human, The Divine entered from the ancient and cold gate—his figure compared to the Gate of Hell was like dust to a mountain, utterly incomparable.</p><p>The ferocious hungry ghosts emerged from the opposite side of the Gate of Hell. The Divine transformed into a soul body with a monstrous face and fangs, towering in size as though he had consumed the souls of hell itself. His palm seemed capable of covering the entire sky.</p><p>Until now!</p><p>As Bei Huai traced back, the roar that initially echoed in the White Tiger Range, appeared in an instant in front of him, trailing behind The Divine’s figure, arriving late.</p><p>But like thunder, it exploded in the depths of everyone’s souls.</p><p>“Hungry! Ghost! Path!”</p><p>A punch!</p><p>Ferocious and monstrous, the giant hungry ghost, with a terrifying appearance, delivered a punch straight to the head!</p><p>Bei Huai’s equally huge soul body’s head dodged.</p><p>With a thunderous sound, he didn’t have time to defend himself at all. His entire soul body was blasted away by this sneak attack, shattered all over, and finally embedded outside the Four Symbols Secret Realm, within the divine soul gate that he had personally closed.</p><p>The sound of battle, still late to arrive, spread in all directions:</p><p>“The wrath of the underworld, punching through the Nine Serenities!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
