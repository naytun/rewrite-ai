In the direction of the Vermilion Bird lineage?”</p><p>“Yes, I saw that…”</p><p>“Oh my God, is this the ‘Godhood called a god at the gates of hell’. That man is too fierce. Is that soul body opposite him a Holy Emperor?”</p><p>“However, it is only a wisp of his thought incarnation…”</p><p>“That’s still very strong. A demi-saint can fight a Holy Emperor… Boohoo, why do I feel a little touched? I want to cry, boohoo.”</p><p>“Yan’er, I have to leave…”</p><p>Xiangxiang looked at the girl who suddenly lost control and cried her eyes out. She patted her head and sobbed a little too.</p><p>“If someone comes to look for you in the future, just tell them what you saw. You don’t have to tell them your speculations about me. Also, learn to refuse and use your identity as a trial-taker. Hallmaster Dao knows everything. His meeting with you would just be a formality. He won’t make things difficult for a junior like you.”</p><p>“Wu wu, Xiangxiang, where are you going…”</p><p>“You’re not stupid, and I’m not blindly arrogant.” Xiangxiang smiled, turned around, and left. “Sorry, we were fated to meet, but I can’t give you something to protect yourself. If that’s the case, you will be bound to me. I wish you a smooth journey into the Holy Palace!”</p><p>“Xiangxiang…”</p><p>Yan’er sobbed as she watched her sister turn into a wisp of fragrance and disappear.</p><p>Actually, she already knew everything.</p><p>If one were to say that she had doubts before, she was still in a state of self-deception.</p><p>When the sounds of the Hungry Ghost Path exploded from afar and reached the Vermilion Bird lineage, it already confirmed her suspicions.</p><p>Xiangxiang was too mysterious.</p><p>During their short time together, the calm and confident aura she exuded was something that even the family head of a higher void faction hardly possessed.</p><p>She ignored everything and looked down on the Holy Palace. Her outlook was too broad for someone of her age.</p><p>Yan’er had previously suspected that she was a stowaway, but she did not dare to voice her suspicions. She did not even dare to tell the trial officer as she was afraid that she would accidentally get involved in some dark vortex.</p><p>She had never thought that Xiangxiang was not only a stowaway, but also the king of stowaways!</p><p>“The Divine, Aunt Xiang…”</p><p>Yan’er’s eyes were filled with tears, and she was in a state of shock.</p><p>She had never dared to do something so ridiculous even in her dreams. She had walked with the only female venerable among the Ten High Nobles. Moreover, the other party was very easy to talk to and even helped her obtain many points!</p><p>“What an immortal couple…”</p><p>As she looked into the distance, Yan’er’s vision was blurred by her tears, and she could not see much of the scenery clearly.</p><p>Not long after, she felt there were many auras around her.</p><p>Those auras were from the Sovereign Stage, the Cutting Path Stage and the higher void levels. They were all extremely ferocious, like vicious beasts that were ready to devour people.</p><p>White-clothed people!</p><p>“Your name is Yan’er?”</p><p>“Yes… Sob, sob, I am Yan’er… Sob, sob, I have an important message to report…”</p><p>“There’s no need to report it. Come with us!”</p><p>“Sob, sob, I’m a trial-taker… Wuwu, if you want to take me away, have you asked the chief trial officer…”</p><p>This soft and cute girl used the mildest tone but uttered the toughest words. The white-clothed people suddenly did not dare to make a move.</p><p>It was true that they had received orders from Hallmaster Dao, but he did not say that they had to forcefully bring anyone along.</p><p>Moreover, this was the Holy Palace’s territory. On the surface, they had to give face.</p><p>“Then tell me about your situation…” Before the leader of the white-clothed people finished speaking, he touched his earlobe and his expression became extremely respectful.</p><p>“Alright, alright…”</p><p>“Yes, sir! Hallmaster Dao!”</p><p>He raised his head again. He was confused but asked the little girl in front of him very seriously, “Where is she?”</p><p>“Wu wu…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang, who was also one of the Ten High Nobles?</p><p>Yan’er wiped her tears. She had never been so close to the Ten High Nobles in her life.</p><p>At the same time, she also admired Aunt Xiang, who was able to predict things so well that she could even counter Hallmaster Dao.</p><p>“All of you were a step too late…”</p><p>“What are they doing?”</p><p>Vermilion Bird lineage, at the barrier of the Soul Capturing Realm.</p><p>The moment Bei Huai’s soul body snapped out of his trance, he looked down. He was angry at Xu Xiaoshou’s mockery, but he also felt ashamed about The Divine’s sneak attack.</p><p>When did The Divine learn such a Deviated Path and actually launched a sneak attack?</p><p>Soon, he was puzzled by the actions of those two people.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou and The Divine started chatting on the spot?</p><p>Not long after, the two of them became excited, like long-lost brothers who were reunited. Their soul bodies and auras became close.</p><p>One of them took out the Holy Medicine…</p><p>One of them took the medicine instantly…</p><p>Bei Huai’s soul body trembled!</p><p>As a supreme expert of the soul body, how could he not see that Xu Xiaoshou had given him a Holy Medicine that could enhance the soul body?</p><p>Ten of those Holy Medicine would enable The Divine, who was exhausted after one punch, to launch at least ten more punches!</p><p>“Why was The Divine here?”</p><p>This was a question that no one had been able to answer since the beginning, and Bei Huai still had not gotten an answer.</p><p>After he devoured the power of the Soul Capturing Realm and barely managed to regain some of his mobility, he did not counterattack at the first moment. Instead, he looked at the sky outside the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>“I cannot be delayed…”</p><p>As one of the Ten High Nobles, Bei Huai naturally knew how strong and irrational The Divine was.</p><p>Regardless of the reason, he had appeared and his target was him. He absolutely could not fight. Once he made a move, he would definitely be delayed!</p><p>His own target had always been Greedy the Cat Spirit. Once he was delayed, he didn’t know what would happen.</p><p>The Divine’s opponent was someone else!</p><p>“Ai Cangsheng.”</p><p>Bei Huai looked into the distance and said indifferently.</p><p>His utterance was not loud, but its sound traveled thousands of miles. Not only did the people in the Four Symbols Secret Realm hear it, but it also spread to the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe in an instant.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
