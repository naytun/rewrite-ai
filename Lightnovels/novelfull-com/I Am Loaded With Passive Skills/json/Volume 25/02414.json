You must take it. I, I’ve already taken too many. If this continues, I’ll really be embarrassed…”</p><p>“It’s okay, Yan’er. You take it. We’re good sisters.”</p><p>“Xiangxiang! We’ve only known each other for less than three days. You’re so good to me. If this continues, I’ll fall in love with you!”</p><p>“It’s okay, I’m loved by everyone… Oh, no, I told you, I don’t want to join the Holy Palace. My family requested that I join the trial.”</p><p>“Sob sob sob, dear Xiangxiang, how can there be such a cute woman like you in this world? Not only are you beautiful, but you have a good figure and such a great personality… If I do get married in the future, I won’t find any stinky man. I’ll marry you!”</p><p>“There’s no need! Not all men are stinky. I have a man, and he’s very strong.”</p><p>“Oh…”</p><p>When the beautiful girl named Yan’er heard this, her small face fell. She kept quiet, swung her dagger down and sliced off the tall deviant ghost’s head with ease.</p><p>Points were credited.</p><p>Yan’er did not appear happy at all.</p><p>She lowered her head, but her vision was blocked. She reached out, held the two snow-white lumps in front of her chest and pouted dejectedly. “Dear Xiangxiang what does it feel like to be with a man?”</p><p>“Eh?” Xiangxiang’s thoughts went blank for a moment. Could this be said?</p><p>“You’re 26 and you haven’t dated before?”</p><p>“The family won’t allow it…”</p><p>“No way. You don’t date just because your family doesn’t allow it? Yan’er, you’re so beautiful and your figure is even better than mine. The queue of people chasing you should start from the Central Region to the Eastern Region’s spatial fragments!”</p><p>“Oh, I’m scared. So, if I don’t go out, I won’t be able to meet any men. Also, I heard that if I get married, I have to hold hands. If I hold hands, I’ll have children…”</p><p>“Oh! You’re really…” Xiangxiang held her forehead with one hand and felt her vision darken in incredulity.</p><p>Could there really be such an innocent girl in the Spiritual Cultivation World?</p><p>Had she been too isolated from the world after she stayed in the Yougui Pavilion and the Cross Corner Street for too long?</p><p>“If there’s a chance, I’ll introduce you to a young master from the Eastern Region. He’s very pure and I reckon he’ll like your type with big breasts and no brains.”</p><p>“Woo! Baby, I love you!”</p><p>Yan’er’s face turned red when she heard this, but she did not want to be outdone and exclaimed again.</p><p>Soon, she couldn’t handle this topic anymore. She looked up at the sky and said with a worried look in her eyes.</p><p>“Speaking of which, there had been a lot of accidents in this Holy Palace Trial!”</p><p>“Fortunately, we’re in the White Tiger lineage. I heard that a large number of people died in the Azure Dragon lineage and the Vermilion Bird lineage.”</p><p>“That’s right, my bestie went to that ruins. Xiangxiang, you are clearly so strong. Are you really not going to try your luck? As long as you shout out that name…”</p><p>“Please don’t ever do that!” Xiangxiang’s eyes turned solemn and she interrupted in time. “Yan ‘er, no matter how you believe in me, treasures are not obtained by those who are fated, but to those who have the strength. If we go in, we would only have given it for free, and there would only be a slim chance of survival. So, don’t recite the name!”</p><p>“What? Then my bestie…”</p><p>“Heh, I’ve disliked that b*tch for a long time. She doesn’t have the fate of a princess and yet she is full of the ‘princess’ syndrome. She is so arrogant and even stole your points. It would be better if she died!”</p><p>“Oh…” Yan ‘er was stunned. When she looked at Xiangxiang who sneered in disdain, she felt the world spin for a moment.</p><p>When her bestie was around, Xiangxiang was very close to her. How could she speak ill of her behind her back like this?</p><p>“It’s just a Holy Palace Trial, yet so much nonsense has occurred. Hmm, I don’t know what the people above are thinking. It was indeed unexpected…”</p><p>Xiangxiang also looked up and her eyes were filled with worry.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou had not contacted her yet. This was good as it meant that everything was still under control.</p><p>Even if Dao Qiongcang made a move to target the Saint Servant.</p><p>With Xu Xiaoshou’s ability, he would have to hold on until the end of the Holy Palace Trial before he gave up, right?</p><p>She just didn’t know how the Qilin was. Had it started taking action yet? Xiangxiang’s thoughts drifted away.</p><p>Yan’er did not dare to continue this topic.</p><p>Xiangxiang had such a unique personality, and the way she lived was also the kind that she envied the most. She had a man, spoke without restraint, and had a terrifying background. She was simply a living example of the life providence of the female lead in a novel!</p><p>“Xiangxiang dear, your star diamond earrings are so beautiful. Where did you buy them? You have such good taste!” Yan’er’s big eyes rolled as she praised her taste in what most girls liked to be praised for.</p><p>“Is that so?” As expected, Xiangxiang turned back and smiled. “My man gave it to me. He said that he wanted to keep in touch with me at all times. It’s just that all stinky men are the same in the world. He hasn’t sent me a message yet.”</p><p>“What? I thought not all men are stinky?”</p><p>“That was just now. Now, everyone who comes stink. It stinks!”</p><p>“Oh, I also want to be stinky… Oh no, are these ear studs so magical? It can even send you a message across two worlds? Isn’t your man outside?”</p><p>“That’s right. He found the Path Division and asked that so-called number one on the Heaven Rankings to make it. It’s a Divine Secret? Isn’t it amazing?”</p><p>“Wow, the Divine Secret…” Yan’er’s eyes turned starry. Suddenly, her expression changed. She pointed at the star diamond earrings and asked in surprise, “It’s moving?”</p><p>Xiangxiang’s eyebrows shot up. She also noticed the slight movement on her earlobe, and her heart sank.</p><p>She smiled quietly. “You have to leave now. What’s going to happen next will be very mushy. Or do you want to hear our dirty exchange?”</p><p>“Bah!” Yan’er’s face turned red. “Who wants to listen to your dirty exchange?!”</p><p>She jogged away and even withdrew her spiritual senses, afraid that she would hear some foul language that would taint her pure heart.</p><p>“You don’t have much experience, but you seem to know quite a lot?” Xiangxiang sneered as she turned away and pressed the communication button.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
