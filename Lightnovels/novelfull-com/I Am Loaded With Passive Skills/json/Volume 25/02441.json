Ye Xiaotian was baffled.</p><p>“Aje…”</p><p>The white-haired Daoist’s face darkened upon hearing this, shoving the ring back, “When did I ever say I wanted to save Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>“Are you really willing to throw away your dignity like this?”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi’s disdain was evident; he knew full well how Ye Xiaotian had obtained his demi-saint person.</p><p>Such a thing was hard to come by even in the Holy Palace, and if one were to be sanctified amidst all eyes, that would be the peak of their life.</p><p>Yet Xu Xiaoshou had casually given it away. Could such a huge favor be so easily forgotten?</p><p>“Tsk, tsk, tsk…” Qiao Qianzhi shook his head in disbelief, as if he were seeing Ye Xiaotian in a new light, then turned and walked out the door.</p><p>“Tsk, tsk, tsk…” Xiao Qixiu poked his head in from outside, also clicking his tongue before retreating.</p><p>“Tsk, tsk, tsk…” Storyteller and Patriarch Wuji didn’t understand the situation, but they were adept at reading the atmosphere. If someone clicked their tongue, they would follow suit.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was about to explode with rage.</p><p>Were these two old foxes going to keep harassing him until his death?</p><p>He gripped the spatial ring, feeling like he had grabbed a hot potato… Wait, didn’t he return the ring?</p><p>Ye Xiaotian lifted his gaze in astonishment.</p><p>But the wooden door was half-closed, and Qiao Qianzhi’s face was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Inside the thatched hut, silence reigned for a while.</p><p>“Location,” Ye Xiaotian finally raised his gaze.</p><p>“The Qilin Realm, Gong Yang Mountain,” Bazhun’an paused, “He should still be there.”</p><p>“The Four Symbols Secret Realm?” Ye Xiaotian was a member of the Holy Palace and the leader of the Golden Tower in the Four Symbols Secret Realm. How could he not know these coordinates?</p><p>“Yes,” Bazhun’an nodded.</p><p>“Could it be that Xu Xiaoshou intends to obliterate the Four Symbols Secret Realm?” Ye Xiaotian was starting to panic.</p><p>He had an emotional attachment to the Holy Palace and knew how crucial the Four Symbols Secret Realm was to its legacy. He hurriedly asked, “When do we leave?”</p><p>“To be determined,” Bazhun’an chuckled, then turned and walked out of the thatched hut. “If he encounters any trouble, he’ll naturally think of me. If not…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian snorted disdainfully.</p><p>He had long since figured out Xu Xiaoshou’s nature when he reached the Acquired Stage of Spiritual Cultivation.</p><p>Wherever he was, would there be no trouble?</p><p>As Bazhun’an walked out, the three sons of the Spirit Palace naturally dared not lag, fearing that the group of Saint Servant might cause trouble in their humble Spirit Palace. So, they followed closely behind.</p><p>The group left the thatched hut and headed towards the Outer Yard of the Spirit Palace in the night.</p><p>After enjoying the beauty of the Spirit Palace for most of the night, they returned to the peaceful shore of Goose Lake.</p><p>Xuan Wuji suddenly turned to Qiao Qianzhi and said profoundly, “Tiansang Spirit Palace, hidden dragons and crouching tigers…”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi was taken aback, then chuckled and said, “With the dragon imprisoned and the tiger about to leave the mountain, what else can this Spirit Palace hold?”</p><p>“Are you a Divine Sorcerer?”</p><p>Xuan Wuji’s question made even Bazhun’an turn back, giving Qiao Qianzhi, who didn’t look remarkable, a second glance.</p><p>“No…” Qiao Qianzhi was dumbfounded, “Divine Secret, how could I…”</p><p>“Then what technique did you just display?” Xuan Wuji saw the special spiritual veins that appeared in the air when Qiao Qianzhi entered and left the scene by Goose Lake.</p><p>And the subtle manipulation where he discreetly returned the spatial ring to Ye Xiaotian.</p><p>It resembled Divine Secret, yet it was not…</p><p>Southern Region magic? It didn’t seem like it either…</p><p>“The Way of Spirit Array,” Qiao Qianzhi chuckled dryly.</p><p>“Hehe…” Xuan Wuji’s expression turned cold. “So, you’re a Saint Stage Spirit Array Caster?”</p><p>“How could that be? I’m merely at the Master Stage of Spiritual Array…”</p><p>“Is this just a façade to show the Holy Divine Palace?” Xuan Wuji was genuinely curious. He couldn’t see through the special spiritual veins, and the more he thought about it, the more fascinating it became. “What about behind the scenes?”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi hesitated for a moment, imitating the tone of a certain Shou, “Grand Master of Spiritual Array?”</p><p>Xuan Wuji:</p><p>He looked deeply at Qiao Qianzhi, “What a remarkable Grand Master of Spirit Array…”</p><p>And thus, the night passed.</p><p>The patience of the group was admirable as they watched the geese at Goose Lake, without any signs of impatience, except for one.</p><p>Xiao Qixiu stood through the night.</p><p>His sword trembled through the night.</p><p>He comforted himself in secret through the night.</p><p>Until dawn scattered across Goose Lake, its shimmering ripples breaking the calm surface of the lake.</p><p>His long night of hesitation and struggle shattered, transforming into resolute determination.</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>A sword cry pierced through the air, echoing in all directions.</p><p>Xiao Qixiu stood firm in the distance, pointing his sword at Bazhun’an. The scene of this battle coincided perfectly with his moves.</p><p>No longer concealed, his sword will soared to the sky, rising and falling layer by layer, culminating in a resolute battle cry.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
