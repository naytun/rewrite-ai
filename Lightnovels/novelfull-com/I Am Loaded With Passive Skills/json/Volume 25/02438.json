Did I ever say I’d give Greedy the Cat Spirit to you? Are you, Holy Emperor, indulging in daydreams, believing you can simply take whatever you desire?” Xu Xiaoshou laughed heartily, stuffing Greedy the Cat Spirit into his chest.</p><p>Qilin was taken aback.</p><p>But then, the insignificant ant below reached out and retrieved something…</p><p>A communication bead?</p><p>At this critical moment, a communication bead?</p><p>In the face of imminent death, did he still hold hope of summoning someone to turn the tide?</p><p>“Give me a chance?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clutched the communication bead, surprised that Holy Emperor Qilin would wait.</p><p>He had thought he might need to use the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff again and give this horned Qilin a hard knock.</p><p>Holy Emperor Qilin’s four claws moved, quickly halting its actions, and its lips parted:</p><p>“Speak.”</p><p>His last words…?</p><p>It was surprisingly magnanimous at this moment…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed out loud, but without fear, meeting the deep blue eyes of Holy Emperor Qilin:</p><p>“Remember this moment.”</p><p>“If we meet again in the future, Bei Huai, I will give your true body the time for such ‘last words’.”</p><p>But this wasn’t a moment for final words.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou activated the communication.</p><p>After all, it was the Holy Emperor Bei Huai, and there was no one left to protect him.</p><p>He just wanted to know, before this final counterattack, if there were still people standing behind him.</p><p>If there were, why hadn’t they shown up yet?!</p><p>“Beep…”</p><p>The communication bead connected.</p><p>It connected quickly, as if the other side had been waiting for this call, and a hoarse voice, bearing traces of amusement yet not fully, promptly came through:</p><p>“Oh? It’s Lord Shou”</p><p>In the sky above, Holy Emperor Qilin’s eyes suddenly narrowed, and the energy of the heavens and earth seemed to freeze.</p><p>Instinctively, it wanted to pounce down and eliminate all potential threats.</p><p>But just in time, it stopped itself, returning to an indifferent demeanor, in control of everything.</p><p>Even though they hadn’t seen each other for decades, Bei Huai remembered who this voice belonged to…</p><p>“Bazhun’an?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
