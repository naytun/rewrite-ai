The immense pressure they brought made it hard for the people to breathe.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The beauties were stunned. This was the first time there was widespread panic in the Flower Pavilion.</p><p>Half-Moon Bay didn’t allow the existence of demi-saints and above. The highest level was the higher void level. Who could have such an imposing aura?</p><p>Moreover, if these two men were to walk up to the third floor in this manner, the two Pavilion Masters would be blamed and they would die!</p><p>However, even if they wanted to stop them…</p><p>They could not move at all!</p><p>Even the higher voids could not move!</p><p>“Sir…”</p><p>Someone wanted to say something, but the saber at his waist buzzed and emitted a sharp sword energy that hurt its owner!</p><p>Everyone’s pupils constricted. Only then did they notice the scar on the mortal’s neck and that there were only eight fingers on his hand.</p><p>At this moment, several beauties parted their red lips at the same time. The second floor of the Flower Pavilion seemed to have brightened up.</p><p>“Shh…”</p><p>The Storyteller laughed, turned around and hissed. He pointed above his head and then shook his head.</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes!”</p><p>The few beauties nodded vigorously as each of them suppressed the excitement in their eyes. Some of them secretly covered their mouths and gasped.</p><p>“Ba…”</p><p>Ta, ta, ta.</p><p>The sound of footsteps could be heard, and Bai Yezi pursed her lips as she hummed a tune. She was focused on changing the water for the laurel from the Cold Palace by the window.</p><p>This was Big Brother’s favorite flower, and it came from the Cold Palace Emperor Realm. Of course, it was also Big Sister Yue’s favorite flower.</p><p>She couldn’t remember when was the last time she saw them.</p><p>However, every time Bai Yezi changed the water for the Cold Palace’s laurel, an image of the immortal couple smiling at each other came into her mind. She could not help but smile too.</p><p>This time was no exception.</p><p>“Xiao Kui, help me get a pot…”</p><p>When she turned around with the vase in her arms, Bai Yezi was stunned.</p><p>Because the footsteps were not Xiao Kui’s, but the person in the illusion!</p><p>What was different from the past was that the person’s white clothes were no longer spotless.</p><p>The one beside him was not Sister Yue, but was a man in a red dress.</p><p>“Ta.”</p><p>The sounds finally stopped at the entrance of the three-story building.</p><p>Bai Yezi’s hands loosened her grip on the vase and it fell to the ground with a thud. She cupped her cheeks.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>A cry filled the entire Flower Pavilion.</p><p>Hei Yezi, who sat in front of the dressing table and was writing something, frowned. Her eyes were filled with anger and she was about to scold her.</p><p>Pa da.</p><p>The brush in her hand fell on the white paper, and dyed the letter black. Her pupils dilated, little by little.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>This person who was usually dignified, serious and indifferent among the thirteen beauties rarely had a change in mood, let out a scream that was exactly the same as her sister’s.</p><p>She did not care about her image at all!</p><p>“Big Brother?”</p><p>“Big Brother?”</p><p>Whoosh, two figures tore through the void like arrows leaving the bow and rushed toward the two figures at the stairwell. They were surprised and happy as they wanted to embrace that person.</p><p>“You’re not allowed to hug him. Your big Sister Yue will be unhappy…”</p><p>The Storyteller hurriedly stopped his two younger sisters.</p><p>“Ning Hong Hong! Let go of me! I’ll fight it out with you!” Bai Yezi cried as she tugged at the Storyteller’s hand, but she could not pull it away.</p><p>Hei Yezi also glared at this guy angrily and her eyes were filled with murderous intent.</p><p>“Aiyo, you two only have this brother in your eyes. You don’t treat me as your brother anymore, right? It’s been so many years since we last met. What’s wrong with hugging me? Aren’t you happy to see me?”</p><p>“None of your business! Ning Hong Hong, let me go!”</p><p>Bai Yezi couldn’t stop the Storyteller. She was so anxious that her tears started to fall. She simply opened her mouth and was about to bite like a furious puppy.</p><p>“That’s enough!”</p><p>Bazhun’an waved his hands and laughed. He walked past the three of them and headed towards the tea table.</p><p>“Tea!” Hei Yezi said hurriedly.</p><p>“Oh, okay.” Bai Yezi hurriedly wiped the tea table with her sleeve and set up the tea set. She ran to the kettle and realized that there was no hot water. She was so anxious that her tears started to flow and she was thoroughly flustered.</p><p>“Wine!” Hei Yezi suddenly remembered something.</p><p>“Ah, yes.” Bai Yezi patted her head, rummaged through her ring and took out a few bottles of wine. She wiped her eyes and shook her head, then rushed toward the bed in a most unladylike manner. She opened the box from under the bed and took out a wine jar.</p><p>Pop.</p><p>When the wine stopper was pulled out, the fragrance filled the air.</p><p>“Pastries!” Hei Yezi took the wine jar and called out again when she saw that something was obviously missing from the table.</p><p>“Yes, there are also pastries…” Bai Yezi’s shoes flew off as she ran. When she reached the staircase, she suddenly burst into tears. “Why aren’t you running? Why am I the one running!”</p><p>“Didn’t you just learn how to make laurel cakes?”</p><p>“Sob sob sob, I want to personally make pastries for big brother…” Bai Yezi shouted and was about to rush down to the second floor barefooted. Suddenly, she leaned on the banister and turned to look at the white-robed figure. “I can’t see my big brother when I’m on the second floor…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
