Fortunately, only the towns were damaged. The aftershock spread to the city but was blocked by the spiritual array. According to preliminary statistics, there were more than ten thousand dead and countless injured…”</p><p>“The Hundred Shattered Beast Mountain has turned into an abyss. All the spiritual beasts there have died. The Eight Armed Sky Ape, the overlord grade spiritual beast of the Hundred Shattered Beast Mountain that is suspected to be close to the Saint level, lived in the flower and fruit cave that was right under the giant’s feet. It was unfortunate.”</p><p>“The giant broke the seal of the heavenly spirit ruins of the Hundred Shattered Beast Mountain with one foot. It’s suspected to be a higher void and touched the Saint ruins. However, the ruins turned into dust as soon as they appeared. There’s no hope for any inheritance left.”</p><p>“And…”</p><p>“Also…”</p><p>“There is even more…”</p><p>From the Qilin world to the Central Yuan world.</p><p>As the Ultimate Giant and the Holy Emperor Qilin fought, information from the observation teams during the battle were constantly sent to the Saint Mountain headquarters.</p><p>In the end, it fell to the headquarters of the Transformation Division. After being dealt with and arrangements made, the rest of the unresolved matters were reported to the Heavenly Court. The Chief of the Transformation Division passed it on Hallmaster Dao for him to handle it.</p><p>The various branches of the Holy Divine Palace were fully activated. They turned into precise machines that constantly made up for the losses in the battle to the minimum.</p><p>Even so, the battle damage that outsiders couldn’t touch were a shock to the intelligence personnel.</p><p>“In the Shengshen Continent, any battle for the Sovereign Stage and above requires a bounded domain to be opened. I didn’t quite understand this rule before. It seemed like taking off your pants and farting.”</p><p>“Now that I think about it, Hallmaster Dao is indeed far-sighted. There’s a need for these rules to exist!”</p><p>“Unbelievable, what the hell is that giant? The Holy Emperor Qilin was actually torn apart by him!”</p><p>“I heard it was Lord Shou?”</p><p>“Do you believe it? I don’t believe it anyway. How could the Saint Servant Lord Shou be so abnormal? I heard that the ancient Abyss Clan descended.”</p><p>“I heard that it was The Divine…”</p><p>“Why did I hear that it was Hallmaster Dao’s Divine Puppet who lost control?”</p><p>Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, Saint Hall.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang sat in front of a messy silver table and his expression was grave.</p><p>His fingers moved quickly and it was unknown what he was calculating. He subconsciously muttered.</p><p>“Enough of Bei Huai’s remnant thought… I can’t… The bottom line…”</p><p>“There was no riot at the Cross Corner Street…The Divine’s virtual image… Hmm, looks like it had entered the site…”</p><p>“Even if Bei Huai revealed that I was the one who invited him… Yes, it is fine… They let me have the Hallmaster Dao seat…”</p><p>“Situ Yongren is not bad. He rose quickly. All eyes are now on the Mournful Emperor Realm…”</p><p>“The Holy Emperor Rao did not appear in the Mournful…”</p><p>“Xiang Yaoyao ran away like a rabbit. It just so happened that they took advantage when the god of that pavilion was not around… But…”</p><p>“Ancestral God Ranking… This Zhou Tianshen, Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>“Fortunately, Hua Changdeng came out of the mountain this time… Emergency…”</p><p>“Yes, God’s life star… ancestor Life Providence? This thing had also appeared…”</p><p>The hall was quiet yet noisy.</p><p>The resurrected Divine Elf, Xiao Qi, hovered above the table as she moved around among the dense communication devices and issued instructions in an orderly manner.</p><p>“Elder…”</p><p>When Xiao Qi was so tired that she looked up and wanted to complain, she saw Elder Dao’s frown and she dared not say a word. She continued to concentrate on her work.</p><p>As for the subconscious murmurs from Elder Dao when he focused on his work…</p><p>It was only because there were no outsiders here, otherwise Elder Dao would not be like this.</p><p>Xiao Qi knew, but she couldn’t understand the content. His words were intermittent and couldn’t be pieced together.</p><p>She knew that Elder Dao’s thoughts could change into multiple frequencies as it updated dozens of lines of information in a short period of time and processed them at the same time.</p><p>Thus, Elder Dao’s murmurs were naturally very ambiguous, and even the Divine Puppet found it difficult to understand.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang quickly stopped talking to himself.</p><p>An additional scene appeared in front of him. It was from Xiao Qi. It was the scene where the Ultimate Giant tore apart the Holy Emperor Qilin.</p><p>Obviously, this was the most urgent matter.</p><p>“Shocking.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang stopped his rapid finger movements and with a deep sigh, said</p><p>“The Holy Emperor Qilin is a true body, but it’s restricted by the Holy Palace’s four symbols seal. Its power is less than one in ten thousand.”</p><p>“In addition, it had been absorbed for so many years. It is already in a weak state.”</p><p>“Bei Huai’s remnant soul did parasitize it, but it had never been tested before. I think there are some restrictions in its control, so it can’t unleash 100% of its power.”</p><p>“Even so, the Holy Emperor Qilin’s remaining combat strength is still stronger than the Holy Emperor’s thought incarnation.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
