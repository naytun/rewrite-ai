He only needed to implant the result of the Divine Secret into himself again:</p><p>“When the Great Memory technique and the Great Abnormality technique are triggered, other than the Holy Emperor, there’s also Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>That was enough.</p><p>Thus, when he came back from the Wu Rao Emperor Realm, he returned to the Vermilion Bird Golden Tower…</p><p>When he ignored the eye-catching red light for the first time, the second Divine Thirty-Six Form was triggered.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang immediately received two answers.</p><p>“It’s either the Holy Emperor or Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>After a series of questioning, Yu Zhiwen still didn’t notice anything. This meant that this was really the ‘power of oblivion’.</p><p>With that, Dao Qiongcang knew that his Divine Thirty-Six Form had once again achieved success.</p><p>The answer was locked in such a small range, and it was already so obvious.</p><p>When one thing was pretty close, one could treat it as the truth. Dao Qiongcang was almost certain that the red light was Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>Why was it that Xu Xiaoshou had entered the Ran Ming ruins, yet there was another Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>Why was Yu Zhiwen still alive and unharmed even though Xu Xiaoshou appeared in the Vermilion Bird Golden Tower?</p><p>Why was Yu Zhiwen so evasive when the Four Symbols Secret Realm erupted with the power of the Holy Emperor and the aura of the power of the ancestral source appeared once again at the Ran Ming ruins?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang could easily guess the answer to that question.</p><p>Of course, as a Divine Sorcerer, he never believed in speculations. He always took precautions. He only looked at facts!</p><p>The Saint Hall was empty.</p><p>On the silver-white table, two old battle reports had appeared.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang glanced over.</p><p>The first one was from Lan Ling, a deceased member of the red-clothed people who had once guarded the White Cave.</p><p>Her reports recorded in detail all the battles she had participated in in the White Cave, that included her thoughts, speculations, and even her evaluation of all the combat members after the war.</p><p>Among them, Yu Zhiwen’s collaboration was highly rated.</p><p>However, there was one word recorded that posed a big question that had never been solved when she reviewed everything after the war:</p><p>“Run.”</p><p>Lan Ling still didn’t know until her death.</p><p>Did the word ‘run’ that had turned Xu Xiashou’s defeat around come from Yu Zhiwen or Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>The second battle report was from Gou Wuyue.</p><p>Perhaps only Dao Qiongcang and Ai Cangsheng believed the authenticity of this battle report because they were all Ten High Nobles and were well aware of each other’s personalities.</p><p>However, the Council of Ten was not unanimous. If the judicial division said that Gou Wuyue was unqualified, Dao Qiongcang would have to punish Gou Wuyue.</p><p>Putting aside the content of the battle, Gou Wuyue’s statement also had an evaluation of Yu Zhiwen:</p><p>“She can be put in an important position, but you have to pay attention to whether she is emotionally driven and be wary of Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>The two insignificant details on the two reports were not very important compared to the main content. Naturally, not many people noticed it and would make a connection.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang took note of everything.</p><p>“Human emotions are the only variable that the Divine Secret cannot predict!”</p><p>This was something Dao Qiongcang had realized when he underwent sanctification. It was also one of the things he researched on.</p><p>At the same time, he also comprehended the following few sentences:</p><p>“But to be able to get infinitely close to perfection, this was the charm of the Divine Secret.”</p><p>“Because variables are the only standards that can prove the existence of the world, fate, and even the Divine Secret”</p><p>In a word:</p><p>To master the variables is the secret to Heaven and God.</p><p>This was Dao Qiongcang’s path, and it was also one of the reasons why he arranged for Yu Zhiwen to be at the Vermilion Bird Golden Tower.</p><p>“Sha…”</p><p>After a long period of silence in the Heavenly Group’s battle channel, Dao Qiongcang spoke earnestly and ended the communication.</p><p>“Follow your heart and pay attention to your safety.”</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The world collapsed with a bang.</p><p>Even the Qilin in front of him became blurry.</p><p>As the Holy Emperor’s earthly power clashed with the power of the Dragon Ancestor, Xu Xiaoshou knew that something was wrong.</p><p>How could this shattered world withstand the combined attacks of these two forces?</p><p>If the oddity that spread out affected the Four Symbols Secret Realm, it would definitely attract the attention of someone with ulterior motives!</p><p>Moreover…</p><p>“I’m here to negotiate, not to fight!”</p><p>A red Taotie Beast head appeared behind the Berserk Giant. As it spoke, it devoured most of the Holy Emperor Qilin’s energy attack.</p><p>Under the effects of the transformation and the Dragon Pearl, he was able to forcefully stop the subsequent power bombardment of the punches and claws. This prevented that shattered world from being completely destroyed.</p><p>As for the backlash after he stopped the battle, Xu Xiaoshou relied on the energy of the transformation and activated the Acalanātha to resist it.</p><p>The Qilin stopped its attack.</p><p>If it had not cooperated, Xu Xiaoshou really would not have been able to end this head-on battle by himself. Fortunately, the Qilin obviously listened to him.</p><p>“Senior has already tested my combat strength, so you should know that I did not lie.”</p><p>The Berserk Giant did not retract his awakened skill. Instead, after it confirmed that the battle just now was child’s play, he continued to maintain equal eye contact and said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
