That big bald man was nothing but a brute, gifted perhaps in talent, but not in leadership. If Bazhun’an could command him, why couldn’t Dao Qiongcang?</p><p>Emotions could be cultivated or indoctrinated, especially when dealing with those not too bright.</p><p>And with Elder Dao’s scheming mind, coupled with Aunt Xiang in his grasp…</p><p>The Divine could suddenly appear in the Apricot Realm and give him a punch, a distinct possibility!</p><p>“So, what are you suggesting?”</p><p>After giving Li Fugui a deep look, Jin Ren moved a small wicker stool for this unassuming coachman.</p><p>Flattered, Li Fugui waved his hand repeatedly and dared not sit down.</p><p>“Fugui only has some observations, based on an outsider’s perspective, with no suggestions or implications…”</p><p>After he finished speaking, his face turned serious as he stared at Lord Shou before him.</p><p>“Lord Shou should also easily see that Hallmaster Dao’s actions are meant to force your hand!”</p><p>Jin Ren sighed. How could he not know this?</p><p>When he heard Li Fugui mention Aunt Xiang being in trouble, he immediately took out the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale to assess his own safety, precisely because of this realization.</p><p>So…</p><p>Was there no other way?</p><p>Was there no other option but to take action?</p><p>“What about the Saint Servant’s side?” Jin Ren asked, “What does Bazhun’an say?”</p><p>“Lord Bazhun’an’s preparations are quite thorough. Even the demi-saint Ye Xiaotian would be considered a fallback plan.”</p><p>“Even Cen Qiaofu, after his sanctification, could restrain others, while the Upanishad demi-saint Water Ghost could counter Hallmaster Dao.”</p><p>“Not even a challenge to counter for…”</p><p>Li Fugui chuckled as he spoke.</p><p>“If the Water Ghost were still around, Hallmaster Dao wouldn’t dare to personally intervene… Not out of fear, but rather it would become ‘impossible’.”</p><p>“This is a delicate balance. With the Water Ghost present, he could simultaneously restrain many demi-saints, and no one would be willing to be the first to act against him.”</p><p>“But now, Hallmaster Dao has broken this balance with external force.”</p><p>“The reason he can now act recklessly and deal with Aunt Xiang is because he has calculated that the Saint Servant currently lacks support.”</p><p>Yes…</p><p>If the Water Ghost were present.</p><p>And if Dao Qiongcang entered the fray again, once entangled with him, he would shift from being a player to a pawn.</p><p>The Abyss Island served as a cautionary tale.</p><p>If it were someone else, they might not be able to contend with Water-type Upanishad.</p><p>Both being demi-saints of the Upanishad, the Water Ghost, and Ye Xiaotian were markedly different. The former was a cunning and treacherous old fox, resorting to any means necessary.</p><p>Impersonating his own son, enduring numerous humiliations and blows, all for the final fatal strike. What couldn’t he do?</p><p>Unless they’re at the level of the Ten High Nobles, any demi-saint sent out by the Holy Divine Palace would likely be wasted.</p><p>With The Divine suppressing Ai Cangsheng…</p><p>Under these circumstances, it might be better for everyone to refrain from acting, thus preventing the Water Ghost from acting rashly.</p><p>Thus, this eerie and delicate balance was established.</p><p>But with the emergence of the Ran Ming ruins, this balance was shattered!</p><p>The Holy Divine Palace was inevitably involved, and the Saint Servant was even worse off.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu, who could have been of great use, disappeared before his sanctification, and the Water Ghost merely made an appearance, showing off, but was also drawn in.</p><p>Bazhun’an was likely experiencing a headache at this moment.</p><p>Yes, there was also Ye Xiaotian… Jin Ren’s pupils dilated, feeling a chilling apprehension.</p><p>Elder Dao, oh Elder Dao, you were truly cunning!</p><p>Seemingly using Wangze Holy Emperor to hold Ye Xiaotian back, but actually taking the opportunity to strike at the Holy Palace, preventing the likes of Mu Ling from aiding the Saint Servant?</p><p>He probably even managed to suppress any negative consequences of the Holy Emperor’s actions on the Shengshen Continent, forcing the Holy Palace and other demi-saint families to bear their grievances silently, waiting to reconcile after the war.</p><p>Also effectively eliminating all the backup plans of Bazhun’an, rendering him useless, even though it was like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>As Jin Ren thought this through, he couldn’t help but gasp.</p><p>Achieving three goals with one move, he could only acknowledge that Elder Dao had outsmarted everyone.</p><p>The Shengshen Continent truly deserved to be Dao Qiongcang’s main arena, where he even calculates and utilizes the Ran Ming ruins.</p><p>But it was an inevitable situation.</p><p>After all, the Holy Divine Palace’s control over the Shengshen Continent far surpassed that of the Saint Servant.</p><p>When the true self was invited to search for Holy Emperor Qilin, he didn’t even know it was already in Bei Huai’s hand. This spoke volumes.</p><p>It seemed that…</p><p>“This situation is a deadlock?”</p><p>Jin Ren also fetched himself a small wicker chair and sat down beside Li Fugui in front of the Crystal Palace, scratching his head in confusion.</p><p>Hua Changdeng’s sanctification as the Holy Emperor crossed his mind…</p><p>Was it him?</p><p>Was there no Elder Dao’s scheming involved in this?</p><p>“Hmm.” Li Fugui nodded and shook his head, “Yes, and no.”</p><p>“Oh? How so?”</p><p>“I had thought about these things in advance and asked for the opinion from the Saint Servant’s side. Lord Bazhun’an said something.”</p><p>“What did he say?” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up. Truly worthy of Eighth, did he have a solution to this?</p><p>Li Fugui’s expression became strange, and he dared not sit on the chair anymore. He stood up, bowed, and said:</p><p>“Lord Bazhun’an said, Lord Shou, you are the key to breaking the deadlock.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
