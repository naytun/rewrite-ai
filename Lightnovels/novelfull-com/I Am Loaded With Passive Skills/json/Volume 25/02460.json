There’s not much distinction between them.”</p><p>“It could be said that the first demi-saint level has passed, but except for The Divine and You Yuan who can compete head-on, I would not want to challenge its cutting edge.”</p><p>Unlike outsiders, Dao Qiongcang’s standards were too high.</p><p>He could easily estimate the combat strength and weaknesses of this giant. At the very least, it was not comparable to the Fire Power of The Divine who had gone all out.</p><p>But how many The Divine were there in this world?</p><p>“Let’s just treat him as the first demi-saint. After all, he’s still an ancient swordsman. He still has other trump cards that he hasn’t used yet…”</p><p>“Moreover, if he can finish his study of the ancient martial arts of the Human Realm Dao at a single glance, there’s a high chance that Xu Xiaoshou can also learn the Hungry Ghost Path. This talent…”</p><p>After Dao Qiongcang praised him in his heart, he began to predict how Xu Xiaoshou would be able to withstand the after-effects after he activated such a giant.</p><p>“A demi-saint body is not enough…”</p><p>“His Spiritual Cultivation is only at the Sovereign Dao Realm….”</p><p>“The ancient swordsman has a high attack and a low defense. As for the side effects, the Ancient Sword Technique would not be of any use…”</p><p>“He also revealed something similar to the Power Upanishad Formation. His recovery ability is at the Demi-Saint Stage as well…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang subconsciously moved his fingers again, and they shone with a golden light.</p><p>He made a rapid calculation and took into account all the details and parts that ordinary people would ignore.</p><p>In the end, he came to a conclusion:</p><p>“It can’t be borne.”</p><p>“The backlash is too strong.”</p><p>“Even if Xu Xiaoshou’s recovery ability is very strong, he will still be weak after the Human Realm Dao. He will definitely be weak after the giant…”</p><p>“Even if he opened the life Power Upanishad Formation, he would soon be awakened. At least for a short moment, he will faint.”</p><p>“Maybe he might faint halfway through the battle. From the amount of trash talk he’s spouting, I can tell that he’s relying on his willpower to hold on…”</p><p>“The will of mankind is one of the sources of great miracles…”</p><p>“That’s right. Xu Xiaoshou’s willpower can’t be ignored. It’s very strong!”</p><p>“In that case, here comes the problem…”</p><p>After the Divine Elf finished her work, she realized that Elder Dao was calculating again, but there was a hint of relief on his face. She could not help but ask with concern.</p><p>“Elder Dao, Elder Dao, did Xu Xiaoshou exceed the standard?”</p><p>The phrase ‘exceed the standard’ was a term exclusive to Elder Dao and her.</p><p>Back on Abyss Island, it referred to ‘variable’.</p><p>In normal times, it referred to things that even Elder Dao could not predict in advance.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked up and said calmly, “It’s beyond reason but it’s still under control.”</p><p>“Oh, oh.” Xiao Qi was relieved. She quickly flew to another communication bead and imitated Elder Dao’s tone as she issued orders.</p><p>“The problem…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang suddenly took out a pocket-sized version of Xu Xiaoshou that was a heavenly creation. At this moment, he was fully immersed in the thoughts about the problems from Xu Xiaoshou’s perspective.</p><p>“I’m Xu Xiaoshou. What would I do in advance to deal with the upcoming period of time when I might be unconscious?”</p><p>“After all, my opponent is the unpredictable Hallmaster Dao…”</p><p>Central Yuan world, Hundred Shattered Beast Mountain.</p><p>“So heavy…”</p><p>“My eyelids are about to close…”</p><p>After he tore apart the Qilin, Xu Xiaoshou’s first reaction was to not let it go to waste.</p><p>Along with the Qilin blood and Qilin true body, he wanted to throw them all into the Apricot Realm for the Dragon Apricot to handle.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot spirit rejected it.</p><p>What a joke. It had watched the entire battle in the outside world.</p><p>Bei Huai’s power had almost broken through the Apricot Realm previously. If it absorbed the Qilin’s true body now, even if it was a drop of blood.</p><p>At that time, if that terrifying fellow came knocking on its door again, what should it do?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly woke up and realized that his mind was a little unclear. He couldn’t be greedy!</p><p>He threw the two halves of the Holy Emperor Qilin’s corpse into the spatial fragment.</p><p>If this thing was not chopped up, it might be able to be resurrected later. He did not care too much.</p><p>“I don’t have much time left.”</p><p>“Senior Dragon Apricot, do you have any ideas?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s Moment of Enlightenment was still activated, but he did not dare to make a decision alone. He sought the help of the ancestral tree.</p><p>As for the d*mned ‘strongest helper’ mentioned by Bazhun’an…</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou still thought that Eighth Brother was reliable, he would not be Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>That helper might really be the strongest.</p><p>But at the very least, it was unlikely that he would appear unless he was forced to and only as a last resort.</p><p>Bazhun’an knew how to use people to death.</p><p>Even if he knew that that fellow wanted to force him to grow faster through battle, Xu Xiaoshou would be scolded and beaten whenever the occasion arose.</p><p>“I am powerless.”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot spirit expressed that it did not want to participate in Xu Xiaoshou’s inquiry.</p><p>The only area within its ability range was the Apricot Realm. It would move within this range, but beyond this range, it did not even want to move.</p><p>Otherwise, what was its motive for moving to the Apricot Realm?</p><p>“D*mn it, all of them are useless…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had no choice but to rely on his Moment of Enlightenment to stimulate himself and gather his thoughts quickly.</p><p>“Jin Ren, help me out here!”</p><p>He wanted to sleep whenever he thought about it-he really couldn’t hold on any longer!</p><p>In the faraway Ran Ming ruins, they could still communicate with each other through telepathy, so Jin Ren became a tool and quickly helped him to analyze the situation.</p><p>The first sentence he uttered was like a thunderbolt.</p><p>“You’re finished, Boss!”</p><p>“You fainted when you used the Moment of Enlightenment and the Ultimate Giant in the Apricot Realm.”</p><p>“Now, you’ve added the Human Realm Dao, and you’ve even exceeded the time limit of the battle. You’ve even overexerted yourself… You will definitely die of exhaustion after one or two awakenings!”</p><p>“I’m currently hiding in the underground layer of the Ran Ming ruins that no one cared about. I’ve also helped you test the Human Realm Dao…”</p><p>“It’s very useful. I’ll be weakened after I turn it off. I’ve been dizzy for a long time.”</p><p>“You have the power of the Dragon Ancestor and the Heavenly Ancestor’s Power, so you should be better. However, with the other weakened states, these side effects will only lead to death!”</p><p>“I really can’t live any longer?” Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts became more ferocious.</p><p>“Alright, I’m exaggerating. Please don’t let me die…” Jin Ren panicked. “I activated my Moment of Enlightenment and used the Weaving Technique to deduce it. In three days…”</p><p>“Three days?”</p><p>“Yes, you’ll be unconscious for at least three days. During this period, you won’t be able to move or resist. In the current battle situation, it’s no different from dying.”</p><p>“This is the side effect of a normal condition.” After all, Xu Xiaoshou could still think and read Jin Ren’s thoughts.</p><p>“Yes. Under abnormal circumstances, you will have to contract with the Life Dao Disc and you will be in a coma. This will reduce the duration of the coma to half a day. Then, you can use your willpower to force it. At that time, I will stimulate you.” Jin Ren said.</p><p>“If I faint, the Great Dao Disc will automatically shut down.”</p><p>“Yes, Boss. You are indeed muddle-headed. After all, you have forgotten about Greedy the Cat Spirit…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly realized something.</p><p>In his Ultimate Giant state, he dug into his chest without a word.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit who was sleeping soundly amid the boiling flesh, suddenly felt itself flying.</p><p>“Meow?”</p><p>“Use the Three Loathsome Eyes to control me. Don’t close the Life Dao Disc even if you die. Don’t close the Unity of Man and the Heavens!”</p><p>“Meow…”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit tilted its head. It didn’t know what was going on, but it felt that it was needed and it was so happy.</p><p>The three flowers in its eyes swiveled. It wasn’t stupid enough to open its Three Loathsome Eyes and turn them into the Three Tribulation Eyes. It quickly dealt with its owner’s order.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The Ultimate Giant stepped on the Great Dao Disc and entered the state of the Unity of Man and the Heavens.</p><p>At this moment…</p><p>“+(Controlled. Passive Points,+)+1.”</p><p>His Spirit Awakening was triggered.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou broke free from the control of the Three Loathsome Eyes and fell into a daze.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
