She suddenly roared like a madman,</p><p>“I wouldn’t dare!”</p><p>“Your Sister Dongdong is a good-for-nothing. Your Sister Dongdong is a good-for-nothing made from Elixirs. Your Sister Dongdong is afraid of pain, but your Sister Dongdong is even more afraid of death. Ahhhh!!!”</p><p>Clang</p><p>The pipa fell to the ground in shock, and the remaining sound was noisy.</p><p>Ah Yao was so frightened that she did not dare to breathe loudly. She looked around in a panic. When she saw that no one was paying attention to the commotion in the alley at the corner of the street, she heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>“I am… the trash…”</p><p>Then, confusion appeared in her eyes.</p><p>“Sister Dongdong, where should we go now?”</p><p>Dongdong lowered her head. Her hair was disheveled, and a shadow crawled over her face bit by bit. Her soul could not Hidden in the narrow darkness of the street corner.</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>“Where should trash like us go to?”</p><p>“Xiang Yaoyao, long time no see. Did I scare you?”</p><p>When this voice fell, Aunt Xiang looked at Mei’er’s head, which was covered by a white handkerchief, and refused to close her eyes. Her eyes were filled with endless sorrow.</p><p>She had even been reduced to the point where she could only use death to confirm the loyalty of her subordinates.</p><p>However, what was the point of this loyalty even if it was affirmed?</p><p>“Dao, Qiong, Cang…”</p><p>Aunt Xiang raised her head, her brows were tightly knitted, and her fists were clenched so tightly that cracking sounds could be heard. Her gaze was incomparably sharp as if she wanted to cut someone into pieces.</p><p>“I’m here.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang moved the divine Sinan and maintained his smile as he said, “I’ll only say it once. Don’t resist, and you’ll be fine.”</p><p>“Summoning Technique!”</p><p>Aunt Xiang slammed her palm into the air.</p><p>The mysterious and unfathomable Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>She didn’t even have the slightest bit of confidence.</p><p>She had never felt that she could win against the person in front of her, whether it was during the time of the Ten High Nobles or now.</p><p>“Tsk!”</p><p>The spiritual source in the void surged.</p><p>The mist spread out from his palm and Aunt Xiang’s fingertips.</p><p>Virtual image…</p><p>It didn’t come out.</p><p>Aunt Xiang’s eyes were emotionless. She closed her eyes heavily and suddenly laughed.</p><p>“Heh.”</p><p>“Heheha…”</p><p>“Hahahaha, what a showy man. You’re really something!”</p><p>The Holy Emperor had led them here through Guidance.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had even summoned a demi-saint incarnation to deal with her. It was not his subordinate, nor was it a demi-saint thought incarnation.</p><p>With this Flamboyant Elder Dao’s habit of planning before making a move…</p><p>If he didn’t have absolute confidence and absolute evidence, how could he make a move on Yougui Pavilion and herself?</p><p>Since he had already made his move, how could he allow the slightest mistake to happen and let her escape?</p><p>“Divine Secret?”</p><p>Aunt Xiang looked up at the hundreds of white-clothed people in front of her and the Star-patterned White-robed Hallmaster Dao. She regained her composure.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“I can show you. This is the Hundred World Spiritual Severing Array. I spent fifteen minutes studying it in advance.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang moved the divine Sinan.</p><p>The complicated Way of Divine Path Principles hidden in the surroundings was revealed.</p><p>The hundreds of white-clothed people’s bounded domain weren’t just one within one, each of them was in a unique arrangement and was in their array eye.</p><p>Drawing the nested bounded domains was like drawing out another Divine Secrets Array that can block out the communication between the imprisoned person’s spiritual source and the outside world.</p><p>If there was a demi-saint at the array eye, who was proficient in Divine Secret and could control the Hundred World Spiritual Severing Array, they could even cut off the communication of the ancestral power at a small price.</p><p>“What’s going on?” Dao Qiongcang finished his introduction and asked again. “It’s been so many years. You haven’t obtained the power of the ancestral source or comprehended the Penetrating Divine Senses, have you?”</p><p>“You really think highly of me,” Aunt Xiang laughed.</p><p>“Then it seems that I don’t need to send this incarnation over, but it’s also just in case. Maybe Bazhun’an will come and save you, right, the third-in-command of Saint Servant?”</p><p>“Heh,” Aunt Xiang sneered.</p><p>From now on, she would not say another word even if she died. This was the best way to deal with the Flamboyant Elder Dao.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang shook his head and twiddled his fingers as he continued,</p><p>“Oh, I was wrong. The third-in-command should be The Divine. You’re just a Summoner…”</p><p>“In the past, I was only guessing. Yes, I should say that they were only guesses and I had no evidence…the Judicial Division.”</p><p>“Little did they know that my guess has evidence. Unfortunately, they didn’t believe me. But now, they have no choice but to believe me.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang glanced at Aunt Xiang, who remained silent, and said,</p><p>“Judging from The Divine’s state in the Four Symbols Secret Realm, his real body is no longer in the Shengshen Continent, right?”</p><p>Aunt Xiang was expressionless.</p><p>“For you, he brazenly charged into the ruins…Tsk tsk, what kind of idea is this? I can’t understand it at all, just because he’s afraid you’ll read the name?”</p><p>Aunt Xiang was expressionless.</p><p>“If I give you a choice…”</p><p>“First, you can all live, but you will all be mortals. However, you can enjoy a hundred years of glory and wealth.”</p><p>“Secondly, The Divine is still alive and will seek revenge on me for all eternity. As for me, I will run for my life to the ends of the earth.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang paused and looked over calmly.</p><p>Aunt Xiang could no longer remain calm. She gritted her teeth and opened her mouth…She swallowed her anger and swallowed all her words.</p><p>This was Dao Qiongcang!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
