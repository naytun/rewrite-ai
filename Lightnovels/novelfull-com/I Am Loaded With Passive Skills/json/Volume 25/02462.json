His heart and eyes weren’t filled with serious matters.</p><p>Ah Qi had long been torn apart by The Divine and shattered into a remnant soul.</p><p>After he possessed the Holy Emperor Qilin, he had thought that victory was within his grasp and that even The Divine would not be able to defeat him.</p><p>At this moment, he was shocked to find that Xu Xiaoshou had destroyed his host body, the Holy Emperor host body, and his true body!</p><p>“This is too ridiculous…”</p><p>“I totally cannot understand…”</p><p>At this moment, no matter how strong his mentality was, Ah Qi could not help but feel a little afraid of the Ultimate Giant and his future.</p><p>He was a thought incarnation of a Holy Emperor and had independent consciousness.</p><p>He knew that if he died, he would return to zero. Even with the white-robed, barefooted Bei Huai’s research, he could still be reincarnated.</p><p>However, it was because he was too much like a normal person.</p><p>Ah Qi knew that after his reincarnation, there was a high chance that he would no longer be himself.</p><p>“Run?”</p><p>“I’m the Holy Emperor, and I represent Bei Huai. If I’m scared away by a mere Xu Xiaoshou, what dignity do I have left? To return to the Mournful Emperor realm would also be a dead end!”</p><p>“What if I do not run?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou can comprehend the Human Realm Dao with a single glance; he might have mastered the Hungry Ghost Path as well. He also has the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer and so many Soul Holy Medicine. If I don’t run, do I just wait for death?”</p><p>Bei Huai, who was in the Mournful Emperor realm, must have seen the situation on his side through Ah Shou or Ah Mei.</p><p>They could not wait for reinforcements. Even Bei Huai’s telepathic communication was blocked.</p><p>“I am Bei Huai…”</p><p>“I am Bei Huai…”</p><p>“I am Bei Huai…”</p><p>After the third proclamation, Bei Huai’s remnant soul’s eyes shone with a fierce light. He laughed in disdain.</p><p>“To be able to break the Qilin’s true body, I have to say that you have exceeded my imagination.”</p><p>“However, with your attitude, how long can you last?”</p><p>“Even if you have mastered the Hungry Ghost Path, even if you can still use it, what about the backlash after that?”</p><p>It’s bad…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his heavy eyelids and looked at the remnant soul.</p><p>Of course, he could hear that the other party sounded a little fierce, but wasn’t he also at the end of his tether?</p><p>“Your soul body is boiling.”</p><p>Bei Huai’s remnant soul unexpectedly discovered something.</p><p>Because in that instant, Xu Xiaoshou had clearly lost control of his emotions.</p><p>“Your condition is worse than I imagined…”</p><p>“No! You’ve comprehended the Human Realm Dao, but the Hungry Ghost Path is still uncertain!”</p><p>Bei Huai’s remnant soul moved and summoned the Soul Scattering Nail. A drop of soul blood dripped onto it.</p><p>When he saw this, Xu Xiaoshou knew that Bei Huai was still Bei Huai. He would not be scared off by him.</p><p>This guy actually only had a wisp of remnant soul left and still wanted to fight head-on!</p><p>A starving camel was still bigger than a horse.</p><p>After all that was said, this was still a remnant soul.</p><p>But now, although the soul body was not as strong as the muscular giant soul body when he first appeared, he was still a burly man. He was countless times stronger than his soul body that he had not trained much!</p><p>However, how could Xu Xiaoshou be at a disadvantage when it came to psychological attacks?</p><p>“Fifteen minutes.”</p><p>He did not even need to say anything else.</p><p>Just these three words caused Bei Huai’s remnant soul to sink into shock, and his soul body began to boil.</p><p>Fifteen minutes…</p><p>Bazhun’an said to give him some face?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was still waiting. Was his helper coming?</p><p>At that moment, he suddenly remembered the words that had such an impact. Bei Huai’s remnant soul smiled and he did not totally disregard them. Instead, he laughed.</p><p>“You’re waiting for someone.”</p><p>“Isn’t this Emperor the same too?”</p><p>The Ultimate Giant was expressionless.</p><p>It wasn’t that he wasn’t scared, but he really couldn’t control his expression.</p><p>The Ultimate Giant felt as if it was about to leave its body, and there were many barriers in between. It was extremely difficult for it to even move a finger.</p><p>But at this moment, Bei Huai’s remnant soul made a move.</p><p>He quickly contracted the Soul Scattering Nail. His own strength no longer allowed him to perform any spiritual technique, but he could borrow external forces to attack.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could dodge this ownerless Soul Scattering Nail.</p><p>Now that he had formed a contract, he could lock onto his soul body and carry out a fatal pursuit.</p><p>As long as it grazed him once, the Soul Scattering Nail could scatter souls and by the look of Xu Xiaoshou’s weak soul body…</p><p>He would definitely die!</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>In a flash.</p><p>Bei Huai’s remnant soul did not even think twice before it launched a soul body attack.</p><p>This move was like a child scratching an itch compared to the previous shocking battle. It was not worth any mention.</p><p>However, at this moment when both the enemy and the attacker were exhausted, it was the last straw that could break the camel’s back.</p><p>“Why bother…”</p><p>The Ultimate Giant lowered its head and closed its eyes.</p><p>Bei Huai’s remnant soul could clearly see that this fellow’s soul body was so exhausted that it was as if it was about to fall into a deep sleep in an instant.</p><p>But…</p><p>When the Soul Scattering Nail grazed against his face, the giant suddenly looked up again, and a huge dark sword was reflected in his eyes.</p><p>The two swords merged together, and a blood-red dot appeared between the Ultimate Giant’s brows.</p><p>“Red Ghost Inscription?”</p><p>Bei Huai’s remnant soul couldn’t help being alarmed.</p><p>At this moment, a huge roar exploded throughout the world.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>This was the Ultimate Giant who pressured himself to let out a furious roar.</p><p>“Fight! Until the end!”</p><p>“Blood! Till the last drop!”</p><p>In the ears of the people of the Qilin world and the Central Yuan world.</p><p>This was like a summoning talisman, and another summon was issued in the Saint Language.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>A dim light descended from the sky.</p><p>In the Spiritual Universe that most people couldn’t see.</p><p>Just as the Soul-Scattering Nail was about to pierce into the Ultimate Giant, who was unable to move, a void general clad in armor with a sword slung across its chest, appeared in front of the giant and knelt on one knee.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
