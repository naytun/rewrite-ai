Its expression was one of fear and also a little admiration.</p><p>With the help of the Dragon Apricot Spirit, no matter how great the influence of the killing intent was, it was also obliterated.</p><p>It had been some time since the Frost Ferret regained consciousness.</p><p>In the distance, Ice and Ember’s heads also popped out from the cracks in the spatial barrier. They looked curiously at the Crystal Palace that overflowed with vitality.</p><p>This Life force…</p><p>Slash! It was made from medicinal soup!</p><p>“Whoosh.”</p><p>A golden light flashed out from nowhere and turned into a scene in the sky above the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>What appeared inside was a slightly hunched old man dressed in linen clothes and he held a jade talisman. He had a somewhat anxious and expectant look on his face.</p><p>In the center of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, the Dragon Apricot Spirit lazily raised its eyes. It recognized the jade talisman that the man held as one that belonged to the Apricot Realm.</p><p>Naturally, this had been given out by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Each jade talisman was marked by the Dragon Apricot Spirit when it was sent out.</p><p>Thus, when outsiders applied to enter the Apricot Realm, the Dragon Apricot Spirit could tell at a glance who they were and what the scenery around them was like.</p><p>“Li Fugui…”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit remembered this face.</p><p>He was considered one of the better-looking humans.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had also mentioned that this was someone from the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>There was no one else around him, nor was there any external force that bound him. There was also no high-level energy such as the ghost beast aura, the power of a Holy Emperor, the power of the ancestral source, or the Penetrating Divine Senses…</p><p>If he dared to mess around, it could kill him with a slap.</p><p>With a thought, the Dragon Apricot Spirit let this person in.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>His vision blurred.</p><p>Vitality spiritual energy entered his eyes, ears, mouth, nose, and even every pore on his body.</p><p>Even though Li Fugui was mentally prepared, he was still shocked.</p><p>“What kind of paradise is this?”</p><p>He had only taken a deep breath, and the surging life force in the air swept away the mental fatigue caused by having to deal with miscellaneous matters.</p><p>He felt as if he had become younger!</p><p>When his vision was restored and a brand new scene appeared, Li Fugui did not know what to think.</p><p>What a dense Heaven and Earth spiritual energy!</p><p>What a powerful Life force!</p><p>What a deserted space!</p><p>Yes, Lord Shou did have the Yuan Mansion. This is what I heard from the intelligence report. Even if the concentration of spiritual energy is not right, I have to calm down and quieten my mind…</p><p>Oh, from the looks of it, it didn’t seem like the Yuan Mansion. It seemed more like a small world that had just been born…</p><p>Wait a minute…</p><p>Something was wrong!</p><p>This herb garden… Heavens, what was this? Were all the herbs inside Holy Medicine?</p><p>That was…</p><p>Dragon Apricot? Ancestral tree Dragon Apricot? The true bodies of the Nine Great Ancestral Trees?</p><p>Dragon blood? Why was there the aura of a Holy Emperor? The Holy Emperor dragon blood?</p><p>There were corpses, even dragon corpses?</p><p>Why were there so many alchemy cauldrons and shields here? There were many holes here and each hole had an Elixir on top of it.</p><p>This pile of junk… No, this was not junk. D*mn it!</p><p>These jade scrolls, Elixirs bottles, and weapons were all of very high levels… semi-saint person? It’s just strewn about here?</p><p>And…</p><p>This palace!</p><p>Li Fugui turned around and was flabbergasted. He looked like a dog that had just entered the city. He was too distracted to take in everything and even his breathing became heavy.</p><p>The last thing he noticed was a huge, glass-colored, translucent Crystal Palace. It was inlaid with pearls and jade, and its eaves were spread out. It was magnificent.</p><p>Inside the hall, there were various mysterious landscapes made of crystals, such as nine dragons holding pearls, a Bixi monument, a mermaid dancing with a halberd, and coral worm saliva… All of them were extremely beautiful.</p><p>“Crystal Palace!”</p><p>After all, he was a former high-ranking intelligence officer of the Flower Pavilion.</p><p>Li Fugui could still recognize the Inscription Stele that was a Divine Instrument.</p><p>But in his memory, wasn’t this palace sealed in the treasure vault of the Holy Divine Palace? No one could use it.</p><p>How did Lord Shou get it? When did he steal the treasures from the Saint mountain? There was no record of it?</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The arrival of the stranger caused Ember to let out a low cry in the distance. It was eager to fight.</p><p>Li Fugui turned to look.</p><p>Two White Skeleton giant heads popped out from the spatial crack, but they were held back by something and their true bodies could not emerge.</p><p>“Why are they all giant creatures? Does Lord Shou want to build a second Abyss Island?” As he thought of this, Li Fugui heaved a sigh of relief. It was good that his life was not in danger.</p><p>His gaze returned to the Crystal Palace.</p><p>In the great hall, Greedy the White Cat Spirit used a big bathtub… No! This was Elder Sleeveless’s Auspicious Dragon and Phoenix alchemy cauldron. Was it conducting alchemy?</p><p>Beside him stood a demi-saint ghost beast.</p><p>“Elder Han!”</p><p>Li Fugui hurriedly bowed and greeted it. He thought to himself that he had finally seen an existence that was recorded in detail in the intelligence report.</p><p>This was an acquaintance, although it might not know him.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Elder Han, who was in the form of a Little Frost Ferret, turned and glanced at this person. It did not say anything as it stood with its paws behind its back. It had the demeanor of a very arrogant demi-saint.</p><p>“Gurgle…”</p><p>The array of medicinal fragrance wafted from the alchemy cauldron.</p><p>The alchemy cauldron was covered with a lid, and there was a big fire under it.</p><p>“Lord Greedy the Cat Spirit, this is Lord Shou’s true inheritance…”</p><p>While Li Fugui was shocked that even a cat in Lord Shou’s world could carry out conducting alchemy, he did not dare to guess what sort of Elixirs were there. He did not even dare to peek.</p><p>The more you see, the more you hear, the more you will die.</p><p>As long as subordinates learned to wait and had patience, it would be very difficult for them to die.</p><p>“Buzz!</p><p>In the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, the ancestral tree, Dragon Apricot, emitted a golden light.</p><p>The huge and winding golden spirit from the Dragon Apricot suddenly hovered above the clouds in the sky. With an extremely powerful force, it bent down in front of the Crystal Palace and raised a cloud of dust.</p><p>“Human, welcome to the Apricot Realm!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
