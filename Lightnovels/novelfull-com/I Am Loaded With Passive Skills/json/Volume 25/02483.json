It was unsure when it would drag the Holy Palace in. Naturally, he had to prepare in advance and talk to Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>If necessary, he would have to go up the Stairway to Heaven to visit the Five Great Holy Emperor aristocratic family.</p><p>It was definitely required to send at least one demi-saint for such crucial preparation.</p><p>Long Rongzhi was awesome…</p><p>He had extraordinary foresight, strategic thinking, and planning abilities.</p><p>He directly excused himself by stating Infernal lineage had done too much to continue refining that lousy elixir of his…</p><p>The name of the Infernal lineage should have changed to Idle lineage…</p><p>Chi Jia wanted to say something.</p><p>However, the things that the Infernal lineage did were trivial, it was indeed a lot.</p><p>Those who should have gone hadn’t, and those who shouldn’t have come were about to come. Chi Jia could only grit his teeth and endure it.</p><p>He turned to look at the other three and said indifferently.</p><p>“Should I say this? Wei An also entered the ruins of the god slayer to protect the Four Symbols Secret Realm. Even if he didn’t make any contributions, it was still hard work.</p><p>“For this matter, Saint Guard lineage can no longer send any more people.”</p><p>Among the rest, Lou Yu had long gray hair and wore a black and white patterned robe. He had a serious demeanor, and it was evident that he was not one to joke around or speak casually.</p><p>Since he was of the same generation as Long Rongzhi and Chi Jia, naturally he spoke without any reservation.</p><p>“Since the White Tower lineage has passed down to this day, there hasn’t been a new Saint yet. I’m the only one available.</p><p>“The Shengxuan Gate can’t be left unguarded for a day. I can’t leave the Holy Palace.”</p><p>His words made sense.</p><p>Long Rongzhi raised his eyelids and glanced at Lou Yu. From this guy who spoke with such righteousness, he sensed a hint of “I don’t want to go out either” vibe.</p><p>He didn’t say anything and just looked down at the alchemy cauldron and the spirit herbs.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Chi Jia laughed when he heard that. There was a hint of mockery in his laughter. Of course, he could hear the rejection.</p><p>Seeing no one echoing his sentiment, he quickly retracted his expression and looked at the two remaining people from Dharma Gathering.</p><p>The Dharma Gathering lineage had a special status in the Holy Palace. They were law enforcers and researchers at the same time.</p><p>They researched spiritual arrays, heavenly secrets, elixirs, Southern Region techniques, and other Daos, trying to find the Great Path comparable to Spiritual Cultivation.</p><p>Although it was fruitless, the spirit was commendable.</p><p>Da Yao and Xiao Yao of Dharma Gathering were twins with thick eyebrows, big eyes, and straight, serious demeanors. They looked exactly alike, and one was naturally suited for law enforcement, while the other was for research.</p><p>Coincidentally, the Supreme Master of the twins, who was of the same generation as Long Rongzhi, was killed by Senior Zi Chong with a single palm strike because he had gone into cultivation deviation from studying the evil techniques of the Southern Region.</p><p>All the disciples in the Holy Palace and Dharma Gathering lineage could be said to be young, even though Da Yao and Xiao Yao were half a generation more senior than Mu Ling and Wei An.</p><p>Chi Jia was the former authority figure of the Saint Guard lineage. He was the master of internal affairs, the great senior, and was in charge of everything in the Holy Palace.</p><p>Without hesitation, he took the place of Da Yao and Xiao Yao’s Supreme Master and ordered the two demi-saints of the Dharma Gathering.</p><p>“You, Da Yao!</p><p>“Hua Ying isn’t here. The Holy Palace doesn’t need a law enforcer.</p><p>“Go and reason with Dao Qiongcang and ask him what he’s up to. Bring Senior Zi Chong’s command token to go up the Stairway to Heaven. Visit the Five Great Holy Emperor aristocratic family to give him some pressure.”</p><p>Da Yao raised his thick eyebrows and blinked his big eyes. After three seconds, he pointed at himself and said, “Me?”</p><p>Chi Jia sighed and looked at another person by the side who looked exactly the same.</p><p>“You, Da Yao.</p><p>“Go and find Dao Qiongcang…The missions that I mentioned just now!”</p><p>Only then did Da Yao nod solemnly. “But what about Xiao Yao? I’m afraid if I don’t keep an eye on him, he’ll go into cultivation deviation and die!”</p><p>Chi Jia’s mouth opened.</p><p>Lou Yu wanted to say something but hesitated.</p><p>Long Rongzhi’s head came out from the alchemy cauldron, and he no longer dared to ignore it.</p><p>That was right…</p><p>Without Da Yao watching Xiao Yao, the danger level would increase exponentially!</p><p>Long Rongzhi would, at most, blow up a Thunder Peak. The madman of Dharma Gathering could create a new era if he succeeded in his research, but if he failed, it could destroy an old era.</p><p>“Seniors, which of you can help take care of Xiao Yao?” Da Yao pointed at his younger brother by his side.</p><p>This…</p><p>Long Rongzhi pushed aside his dense hair and scratched his scalp. This question gave him a headache. He said, “I need to concentrate when conducting alchemy.”</p><p>Luo Yu still said the same old thing, “Shengxuan Gate can’t be left unguarded for a day.”</p><p>Chi Jia looked left and right, only to see Da Yao’s expectant eyes. He waved his hand and said, “Change a method. Who else can keep an eye on your brother?”</p><p>Da Yao thought for a long time before saying, “Descendants of the Dharma Gathering lineage vary tremendously in quality. Either they are obsessed with research or law enforcement, with very few managing to balance both. Those capable of keeping an eye on Xiao Yao are even fewer.</p><p>“I think I’ll be available if Qiao Qianzhi is still around. After all, Xiao Yao likes him the most, and he’ll listen to him.</p><p>“Unfortunately, he’s not around.”</p><p>Wasn’t this nonsense? The Four Disciples of the Holy Palace had all left and had yet to return… Chi Jia rolled his eyes and noticed the expressions of the people at the side.</p><p>“Qiao Qianzhi…”</p><p>When this long-lost name came out, everyone except for Chi Jia and Da Yao was immersed in their memories.</p><p>Back then, his charisma overshadowed the entire Holy Palace, and was hailed as the successor of the Dharma Gathering lineage. There was even hope that he could pick up the long-abandoned third position of the Holy Emperor person in the Holy Palace, adding further strength.</p><p>However, the line between genius and mediocrity was thin.</p><p>After changing course, even those who once rode the wave’s crest might sink to the bottom of the sea.</p><p>Over time, more than thirty years later, this name remained without stirring up any ripples, evidently forgotten by the masses.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
