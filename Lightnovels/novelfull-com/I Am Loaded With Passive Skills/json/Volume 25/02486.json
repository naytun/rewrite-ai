If someone took this opportunity to chase after him, kill him, and take control of Blood World Pearl…</p><p>This would be one of the purposes of Blood World Pearl!</p><p>It would obtain a stronger holder who could be better guided to death!</p><p>In the Shengshen Continent, if a demi-saint wasn’t self-restrained and wanted to take more action, they would inevitably encounter the obstacles of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>Even if Five Decays of Heaven had three extreme physiques, he didn’t want to confront a Holy Emperor so soon.</p><p>So in the end…</p><p>He seemed to have no choice.</p><p>He still needed to borrow the power of the Blood World Pearl to make a pact with the devil, playing with fire.</p><p>However, under the premise of being on guard against the Blood World Pearl, how to cooperate was another problem that could be negotiated.</p><p>“The current owner of the Blood World Pearl is Seven Trees Emperor who is proficient in the power of guidance.</p><p>“Now that you have it, it proves you have indirectly become a pawn of Seven Trees Emperor.</p><p>“No Holy Emperor is willing to be under someone, even if that person is Bazhun’an. That’s why the Seven Tree emperor has his own thoughts.”</p><p>After coming out from Abyss Island, Five Decays of Heaven and Man visited Yama Chief, Hong Quan, and the omniscient Lord Huang Quan advised him.</p><p>After obtaining this information and barely feeding the bottomless pearl to its fill, and just as the Blood World Pearl was still thinking of playing with him like previously…</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man chose to make it clear.</p><p>He looked at the blood-red bead flashing with joy and went straight to the point.</p><p>“Seven Trees Emperor, let’s meet!”</p><p>The Blood World Pearl buzzed and vibrated, its spinning momentum was unaffected as if it did not hear, and the Crimson Light remained endless.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man continued.</p><p>“I have three great extreme physiques, Lone Star of the Heavenly Calamity, and Night Walker.</p><p>“You’re trapped on the Inner Island of the Abyss Island and controlled by Bazhun’an. You can’t reach the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>“We can only win together if we cooperate.”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man stared at the bead.</p><p>“Therefore, consider it.</p><p>“It will be difficult for you to find someone more suitable than me to be your right-hand man.</p><p>“I can accomplish for you what you can never accomplish on Abyss Island and what you want to accomplish on the Shengshen Continent.”</p><p>The Blood World Pearl buzzed, still glowing and spinning, as if it had heard it, yet also as if it had heard nothing.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man did not receive a response, but he was not discouraged. He continued.</p><p>“I need the semi-saint person. It’s a matter of life and death. There’s no room for discussion.</p><p>“I can promise to keep the Blood World Pearl. After all, I need to borrow its power.</p><p>“Moreover, I might be the only one who walked toward ‘death’ without guidance.</p><p>“In this aspect, you can’t compare to me.”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man said calmly. He had one of the five extreme physiques, the Immortal Body, destined to counter Blood World Pearl.</p><p>Holy Emperor was puzzled.</p><p>So what if the Holy Emperor had the Blood World Pearl?</p><p>The essence of the Blood World Pearl was to guide the holder to death. It didn’t care if the holder was Innate, Master, demi-saint, or Holy Emperor.</p><p>Seven Trees Emperor could possess Blood World Pearl for so long without dying likely because he had one of the best among the power of guidance. He could achieve a balance of power with Blood World Pearl, deriving more benefits from the situation.</p><p>However, regarding immortality and indestructibility alone, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man did not care about the people in the world.</p><p>“Buzz…”</p><p>Blood World Pearl was still spinning.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man took it as his silent consent and began to state his conditions.</p><p>“Give me the opportunity of semi-saint person.</p><p>“Don’t play any tricks. I want to see the full picture!”</p><p>Blood World Pearl projected the image again.</p><p>This time, there was still a gray-haired Daoist child in the picture.</p><p>The difference was that there was a holy and pure white dragon as pristine as jade.</p><p>Opposite the dragon was the green storm on the mountain peak, and the two were fighting.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man fell silent.</p><p>There were two Holy Emperors!</p><p>Not only Wangze Holy Emperor but also the white dragon in the Shengxuan Gate of the Holy Palace.</p><p>Wouldn’t he have bumped into the Grim Reaper’s scythe if he had followed the guidance to capture Ye Xiaotian just now?</p><p>An immortal body did not mean not to be possessed, captured, sealed, snatched, or studied…</p><p>“Others.”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man no longer wanted to carry out missions. After all, Huang Quan didn’t mention when to complete the task. He now just wanted to find the opportunity of other semi-saint persons.</p><p>Blood World Pearl changed the scene.</p><p>This time, a strange space appeared. A cat was inside conducting alchemy, and two people were in the alchemy cauldron.</p><p>One pill after another flew out, containing a large amount of vitality spiritual energy.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man was stunned for a moment.</p><p>He recognized that naked and weak fellow inside the cauldron.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Blood World Pearl’s image changed and focused on a treasure mountain in that space. Some miscellaneous items were scattered inside.</p><p>There were spears, shields, small towers… and a huge pile of spiritual weapons, and the highest value was the Inscription Stele Divine Instruments.</p><p>There were ancient books, jade slips, elixir, techniques, spiritual techniques, medicinal herbs, ores, and many more. Xu Xiaoshou must have plundered them from various enemies.</p><p>A crystal gem-like semi-saint person among this messy pile of items was humbly sandwiched between two fourth-grade four spiritual weapons.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
