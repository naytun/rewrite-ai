After all, he wasn’t a researcher. Even though  Qiao Qianzhi was from the Dharma Gathering lineage, he didn’t have much contact with him.</p><p>Xiao Yao murmured this name, and several ripples appeared in his dull eyes.</p><p>Back then, when he led this person to do research, he was repeatedly shocked and convinced by his shocking thoughts.</p><p>What a pity…</p><p>Only Xiao Yao knew some secrets.</p><p>Geniuses would always fail, and Dao Qiongcang was no exception. All of them had been halted!</p><p>Upon hearing this name, Long Rongzhi was reminded of his contemporary, the rebel Sang Qiye. He couldn’t help but let out a long sigh.</p><p>There was nothing worth reminiscing about.</p><p>What was worth reminiscing, he reminisced every night.</p><p>Lou Yu felt sad. In the same batch, his White Tower lineage had also obtained a heaven-defying space attribute.</p><p>Due to this, Lord White Dragon came out of the Shengxuan Gate once.</p><p>It was detestable that Sang Qiye not only betrayed the palace but also took away three disciples in succession after that, causing the Holy Palace to lose a generation, which somewhat caused a period of decline.</p><p>Lou Yu, who had always been serious, could not help but glare at Long Rongzhi when he thought of this.</p><p>Long Rong Zhi’s eyes also widened and he glared back.</p><p>The two Saints glared at each other but didn’t say anything.</p><p>What should have been scolded had already been scolded decades ago.</p><p>Everything that needed to be done had been done.</p><p>And everyone who needed to be punished had been punished… Senior Zi Chong was really ruthless. The two of them no longer dared to argue.</p><p>Chi Jia did not have a good impression of the four ingrates of the Holy Palace. It was enough for him to have one obedient disciple, Wei An.</p><p>After listening to Da Yao’s nonsense, he could only suggest, “What about you carry Xiao Yao on your back, go find Dao Qiongcang, and climb the Stairway to Heaven?”</p><p>Before Da Yao could say anything, Xiao Yao’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“No.” He quickly extinguished the light in his younger brother’s eyes and said with a hint of fear, “If he gets involved with Zhong Yuanzi…”</p><p>The few people nearby immediately shuddered.</p><p>“It’s indeed not acceptable.”</p><p>“It’s definitely not appropriate.”</p><p>“I was presumptuous…”</p><p>After Chi Jia rejected his own suggestion, he could only consider Da Yao’s not-so-smart suggestion since no one had a better idea.</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi…</p><p>Actually, it was not impossible!</p><p>To a demi-saint, as long as he determined to do it, anything was achievable.</p><p>It was just a person. They could tie him up… invite him back for some time, and let him go after Da Yao returned.</p><p>Chi Jia said as soon as he thought of it.</p><p>Just as he finished suggesting, everyone agreed with him.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>In the distance, a strange sound came from the four-hill mountain.</p><p>This barely perceptible Saint Language was almost unheard of for a Spiritual Cultivator below the level of a demi-saint.</p><p>All present were demi-saints, so how could they not recognize the sound of sanctification?</p><p>“A new Saint has been born on Shengshen Continent!”</p><p>A strange light flashed in Long Rongzhi’s eyes. It was rare for a new Saint to not appear in the Holy Palace.</p><p>But soon, they stood up at the same time with surprised expressions.</p><p>“Spatial fluctuations…”</p><p>Lou Yu’s pupils gradually dilated, and then he laughed heartily.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>“Good! Good! Good!”</p><p>He had said the word “good” three times in a row. It was obvious that he had seen the situation of the new Saint from the spatial fluctuations.</p><p>There were only a few spatial attributes on the continent.</p><p>They could not sense the sanctification in Abyss Island and Huang Quan in the Shengshen Continent. It was only later that the Holy Palace learned about it from Mu Ling.</p><p>As of now, among all the recognized individuals, there was only one who had the potential of being sanctified.</p><p>It was Ye Xiaotian of the White Tower lineage!</p><p>Several demi-saint looked at Lou Yu in shock and murmured.</p><p>“Upanishad demi-saint…”</p><p>“Or Spatial Upanishad…”</p><p>Lou Yu slapped his thigh, and the serious demeanor was nowhere to be seen. “Let’s make a big deal out of it!”</p><p>Not long after.</p><p>A shout came from outside the four-hill mountain</p><p>“Ye Xiaotian, a student of the Holy Palace, has returned with Upanishad sanctification.”</p><p>“B*stard Wei An, quickly open the door for me!”</p><p>A few of them looked at Chi Jia of Saint Guard.</p><p>Chi Jia laughed heartily. Wei An was not in the palace and could not accept the challenge, but he was happy that his contemporary, Ye Xiaotian, had returned after sanctification.</p><p>The Holy Palace was a happy family.</p><p>This Ye Xiaotian was still thinking about their old friendship!</p><p>He had only become a Saint, yet he bothered to come home to meet the elders immediately… Good child, he was really a good child!</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>Lou Yu waved his sleeve.</p><p>Chi Jia, Long Rongzhi, Da Yao, and Xiao Yao stood up at the same time and went to the four-hill mountain to welcome the Saint.</p><p>“Buzz…”</p><p>The great array opened.</p><p>As soon as they appeared, they saw the gray-haired Dao child and a higher void carrying the child.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Long Rongzhi suddenly frowned and retreated behind a few Saints. He saw the gray-haired Dao child covered in blood.</p><p>“Good boy!”</p><p>Lou Yu was happy, and couldn’t care less.</p><p>Without a life-and-death battle, how could there be sanctification?</p><p>The blood on his body wasn’t a battle wound, but a demi-saint’s medal!</p><p>“Something’s wrong.”</p><p>Xiao Yao looked up at the sky and opened his mouth, wanting to say something.</p><p>He initially wanted Chi Jia to quickly close the array, but then he thought that he could also control the array.</p><p>However, if he were to control the great array, it would be disrespectful to the Saint Guard lineage, and it would also expose the fact that he had secretly studied the great array.</p><p>With such a dilemma.</p><p>The sky turned green!</p><p>When the storm gathered…</p><p>When the power of the Holy Emperor surged…</p><p>When the Azure Finger pointed down in shock…</p><p>Chi Jia’s face turned green on the spot.</p><p>“Ye Xiaotian, how dare you, a rebel, return?”</p><p>Long Rong Zhi disappeared instantly.</p><p>Da Yao lifted Xiao Yao to the front, and Xiao Yao took out a series of array wheels from his bosom.</p><p>Lou Yu was just about to fly forward to welcome him but stopped in time to turn around and escape to the Holy Palace. He didn’t even have time to curse.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Chi Jia was going crazy.</p><p>He was a step behind in controlling the great array.</p><p>He could only step forward and raise both his hands.</p><p>“Saint Guard. Guard the world.”</p><p>The four-hill mountain trembled mightily.</p><p>It was as if lifting out the projection of a mountain peak and transforming into a light shield that blocked the Azure Finger.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The power of the Holy Emperor blasted over. Chi Jia’s whole body shook but was not sent flying.</p><p>He only swallowed a mouthful of blood and glared at Lou Yu, and still had the strength to speak.</p><p>“Tell him to get lost!”</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom…</p><p>The light shield cracked bit by bit.</p><p>Chi Jia’s body started to tremble, and his legs were also trembling.</p><p>In front of the four-hill mountain, Xuan Wuji was amazed.</p><p>What kind of formidable person was this?</p><p>A demi-saint could actually resist a finger of the Holy Emperor?</p><p>Ye Xiaotian…</p><p>Xuan Wuyi lowered his head to look at Ye Xiaotian in his arms. Only then did he realize what he had grabbed onto in the Central Yuan world earlier was not just a life-saving straw.</p><p>It was a life-saving mountain!</p><p>This guy could get so many Saint to work for him with just one sentence.</p><p>“Ye Xiaotian?”</p><p>Lou Yu was in a dilemma.</p><p>On one hand, he wanted to bring the successor of the White Tower lineage back to the palace. On the other hand, he didn’t want to offend Wangze’s Holy Emperor.</p><p>The way he addressed him was full of doubts.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian did not have time to explain.</p><p>Wei An wasn’t here, but Chi Jia came out. This was a good thing.</p><p>However, Chi Jia couldn’t stop the Holy Emperor and could only hold on for a little longer.</p><p>A Holy Emperor needed a Holy Emperor to fight with!</p><p>Just as the gap of the great array was about to close and the entire mountain’s defense was about to be activated…</p><p>Ye Xiaotian passed by a few people, flashing to the four-hill mountain and arriving before the Shengxuan Gate, and shouted sorrowfully.</p><p>“Lord White Dragon, do you still remember our agreement? Little Ye is back with Upanishad sanctification!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
