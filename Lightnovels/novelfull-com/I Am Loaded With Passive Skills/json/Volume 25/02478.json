Even the Divine Secret finds it difficult to understand.”</p><p>“I don’t even need to make any promises. The Divine will know that I’m not giving him two choices.”</p><p>You lunatic!</p><p>You idiot!</p><p>You’re an idiot who studied the Divine Secret until your brain was swollen and rotten. What do you know about love?</p><p>Xiang Yaoyao panted heavily. She bit her lower lip until it bled, but she didn’t make a sound.</p><p>“Do you know why I’m so sure of The Divine’s answer?” Dao Qiongcang suddenly bowed.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Why your head!</p><p>Xiang Yaoyao, she thought to herself, don’t be bewitched by him. This guy has the Holy Emperor’s guidance!</p><p>“If you want to ask why…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang paused for a moment before snapping his fingers.</p><p>There was a moment of silence in the Divine Array.</p><p>In the next moment…</p><p>“I’ll kill you, you bastard!!!”</p><p>Xiang Yaoyao’s eyes suddenly turned red. Like a wild beast, she broke the ground and charged out.</p><p>She formed a seal.</p><p>She drew her sword.</p><p>She threw out the rag doll and summoned The Divine.</p><p>The Divine had also activated the Human Realm Dao and the Hungry Ghosts Dao. It had smashed Dao Qiongcang into dust with one punch and devoured his soul completely!</p><p>He was dead!</p><p>This son of a b*tch was finally dead. The whole world celebrated! Hahahahaha!</p><p>Xiang Yaoyao let out a long sigh of relief. She found that she had been walking in the same spot. In fact, she couldn’t even move her fingers.</p><p>What she had just walked through was merely a cycle in the spiritual world.</p><p>Great Reincarnation Technique…Xiang Yaoyao sighed silently. She felt guilty like a weak ant.</p><p>“Yes, the Great Reincarnation Technique”.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang calmly answered the question in Aunt Xiang’s mind, which should not even be considered a question.</p><p>“Life is like a dream, but it’s just a few cups of melancholy.”</p><p>“Your emotions are fluctuating too much. Maybe one day, when you wake up and do what you should do today, you will find yourself still in bed.”</p><p>“But the traces left behind are still left behind.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang flipped his palm, and a cloth doll appeared. There was a lingering warmth on it, and a faint fragrance wafted out.</p><p>He used the Greater Teleportation Technique to get it from Aunt Xiang’s chest pocket.</p><p>“This thing can transcend rules? Interesting.”</p><p>“A pink dress, but a bald head, and so many pinholes…Eh, did The Divine make this?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang raised his eyebrows and glanced at Aunt Xiang, who still did not respond. He smiled and nodded at the doll’s head.</p><p>“I have to comment on this. The Divine craftsmanship is really not good. The doll looks crude.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang’s soul didn’t even have any fluctuations. She was like a dead person.</p><p>However, after blocking her six senses, Dao Qiongcang Cang forcefully opened them.</p><p>She couldn’t help but widen her eyes as she stared at that damned Divine Sorcerer walking over step by step.</p><p>“Sizzle.”</p><p>The long sword cut a finger.</p><p>A drop of blood dripped onto the rag doll.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang hurriedly fed her an elixir, afraid that if he was slow, the wound would heal on its own and he would not be able to compensate her.</p><p>After doing this, he looked up again and said,</p><p>“Actually, the process of taking blood is very troublesome.”</p><p>“I’ve experimented. Eighty percent of the people who fall into danger can’t even control their blood. Most of the time, accidental contact allows the blood sacrifice to protect the body.”</p><p>“So, tell The Divine not to do this next time. This will make him look very outdated…And ‘dazed’.”</p><p>Xiang Yaoyao gritted her teeth so hard that they almost shattered.</p><p>This was the only part of her body that could move. Dao Qiongcang wanted her to speak.</p><p>She almost couldn’t hold it in and spat the bloody foam on Elder Dao the Flamboyant’s annoying face, but she held it back in time.</p><p>“I hate you.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang spoke to the doll in Xiang Yaoyao’s voice. He had learned the way to break and summon the doll without a teacher.</p><p>“Weng…”</p><p>The rag doll shone with a bloody light.</p><p>The surrounding pressure began to settle down rapidly.</p><p>That powerful pressure made the hundreds of white-clothed people behind him tremble slightly, feeling an inexplicable threat.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang disappeared on the spot.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang came out again and slapped away the sand on his robe.</p><p>“He went to the Western Region to play in the sand. Although I don’t know what will come out, I don’t want to face that monster.”</p><p>Despair!</p><p>Xiang Yaoyao was left with only despair in her heart!</p><p>This fellow…</p><p>This guy knew everything, but he was still wasting time here!</p><p>She vaguely understood something.</p><p>After waiting for a while, Dao Qiongcang clenched his fingers and finally looked back.</p><p>“So slow, but indeed reckless,”</p><p>“Just nice, we’ll catch them all in one fell swoop.”</p><p>Outside the Hundred World Spiritual Severing Array, several auras suddenly burst out. Before they arrived, their voices came first,</p><p>“Rest! Life! Injury! Prevent! View! Death! Surprise! Open!”</p><p>“Dubhe! Merak! Phecda! Megrez! Epsilon! Alioth! Mizar! Alkaid!”</p><p>“Aunt Xiang, don’t panic. We’re here!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
