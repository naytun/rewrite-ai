It’s very time-consuming and laborious, and they probably won’t agree, but I’ll persevere. Exploring the unknown of life is where the fun lies.”</p><p>Finally, he put down his pen.</p><p>Bei Huai stared blankly at the protruding tree crown in the sky. He could still hear the distant but ear-piercing voice.</p><p>“Saint growing grass…”</p><p>“Grass…”</p><p>The white-robed youth sighed again.</p><p>“Life is so great…”</p><p>At this moment, he suddenly felt he had a headache and frowned.</p><p>At the same time, Bei Huai, who played with his feet as he folded his belly against a tree branch, Bei Huai who pushed the swing, Bei Huai who fought… Even Bei Huai who ran around the wooden horse!</p><p>All the various Bei Huai stopped what they were doing and looked over.</p><p>Tens of thousands of gazes shot over from afar, from nearby, and from all directions. It was terrifying, but Bei Huai was used to it.</p><p>The ancient japonicum trembled slightly and then lowered a branch as if in query.</p><p>“It’s fine.”</p><p>The white-robed, barefooted Bei Huai smiled and calmed down the turbulent emotions of all the Bei Huai disciples. He then stroked the branches of the ancient japonicum as if to appease it and said.</p><p>“Ah Qi is injured.”</p><p>“It played in the Four Symbols Secret Realm and encountered a situation of sorts.”</p><p>A middle-aged Bei Huai, who was bald and had a pot belly, walked over.</p><p>When he walked in front of the main body, he did not say anything. He simply pulled his clothes off and revealed his belly that was rounder and smoother than a stone.</p><p>There was no belly button or hair on its belly. It was a convex mirror.</p><p>What appeared in the mirror was a scene from the Four Symbols Secret Realm. There were many strange-looking people, beasts, and some buildings that looked like doors… It was impossible to get a clear view!</p><p>“Ah Shou…”</p><p>The white-robed and barefooted Bei Huai caressed the convex belly mirror. He knew that this Bei Huai had good intentions, but he had no choice but to tell him.</p><p>“You… It became much rounder.”</p><p>“I can’t tell if the images on your stomach are of Bei Huai or normal humans.”</p><p>“Go back. Show me again after you’ve successfully lost weight.”</p><p>Ah Shou snorted and stomped off in a huff. However, after he unbuttoned his shirt, he could not button it back again no matter how hard he tried.</p><p>He became angrier and turned around angrily.</p><p>“You made me gain weight!”</p><p>“I just asked you to make the best of your ability. If the surface is expanded, you will naturally be able to see more images…”</p><p>“I don’t want to listen to you! It’s all your fault!”</p><p>Bei Huai sent Ah Shou away and welcomed Ah Mei.</p><p>Ah Mei winked at him and coiled her long black tail into a circle.</p><p>Within the circle, clouds and mist transformed and displayed the scenes of the battle on Gong Yang Mountain.</p><p>The last scene showed how the Holy Emperor Qilin was torn in half, and the Ultimate Giant raised its head and howled.</p><p>Bei Huai’s eyes froze.</p><p>After a long time, there seemed to be a little more light that flickered within his eyes.</p><p>“This giant…”</p><p>From his human form, he transformed into a Golden Giant and then into a White Bone Giant.</p><p>After it fused with the ancient martial arts Six Paths, it could still possess flesh and blood and transform into the most extreme form!</p><p>Bei Huai suddenly looked at Ah Mei.</p><p>Ah Mei lowered her head shyly.</p><p>He then looked at the other Bei Huai on the mountain.</p><p>The rest of the Bei Huai were still mostly normal. They all shouted furiously.</p><p>“Revenge!”</p><p>“Revenge!”</p><p>“Avenge Ah Qi!”</p><p>With a boom, Bei Huai, who sat on the swing, took off his head and underwent a transformation into a 1,000-foot-long bull-headed python instantly. His entire body emitted a mixed aura.</p><p>It jumped at Bei Huai, who played with his feet, and after he pulled out his fingernails, it exploded into a huge single foot in the air… No, he still had a body and his body was the size of a normal human, but that single foot was three thousand feet in length!</p><p>Bei Huai who fought, Bei Huai who played chess, Bei Huai who tried to button up his clothes… Countless Bei Huai mutated and reverted to their true forms.</p><p>All these Bei Huai only had the auras of a higher void. They didn’t even have the semi-saint person.</p><p>However, the most powerful among them even surpassed an ordinary demi-saint!</p><p>“Get ready.”</p><p>The barefooted, white-robed, jade-faced Bei Huai waved his hand and was about to lead the bizarre-shaped Bei Huai army behind him to search for the new giant lifeform.</p><p>He had a premonition that if this research could succeed, it would be even more exciting than obtaining Greedy the Cat Spirit.</p><p>That person…</p><p>Bei Huai stopped in his tracks and flipped open the Bei Huai record book. He took the lead and wrote down the old name of the soon to be Bei Huai on a brand new page:</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>He raised his head again and saw Ah Mei, who was hesitant to speak. He couldn’t help but ask after a moment of silence,</p><p>“Ah Mei, do you like the strong ones?”</p><p>Ah Mei lowered her bull-horned head and wriggled her black snake tail. She shuffled about on the ground and said in a slightly expectant and hoarse voice.</p><p>“Multiply… Grow…”</p><p>Bei Huai put away the manual and was about to make a move.</p><p>With a rumble, a silver full moon slowly rose outside the Mournful Emperor realm. There seemed to be a phantom of a palace in it.</p><p>In the sky, eight ancient sealed words appeared:</p><p>“Shengshen Continent, Bei Huai, stop!”</p><p>“I have something urgent to attend to this time, and I promise I won’t hurt the innocent.” Bei Huai said solemnly.</p><p>With another rumble, a phantom astrolabe appeared outside the Mournful Emperor realm, and the Path Principles on it surged.</p><p>The eight ancient sealed words appeared in the air again:</p><p>“Shengshen Continent, Bei Huai, stop!”</p><p>“You… are forcing me?” Bei Huai’s face was devoid of any emotion.</p><p>With another rumble, the projection of a towering mountain appeared.</p><p>This time, it wasn’t a phantom outline, but a human figure who carried a sword.</p><p>“Shengshen Continent, Bei Huai, stop…This is not a joke.”</p><p>“You should know how dangerous you are.”</p><p>The figure was like a candle in the wind. His aura was extremely low, as if he had come from the Nine Sereneties.</p><p>The sword in his hand was riddled with holes and looked as if it would break at the slightest touch.</p><p>“Hua Changdeng…”</p><p>Bei Huai’s eyes narrowed. He glanced at the Stairway to Heaven. His expression was strange. “Did Dao Qiongcang send you? Are you going to break through?”</p><p>Hua Changdeng held the lantern from the Land of Screen and Candles.</p><p>Under the flickering candlelight, the small dark swords in his eyes condensed. The world he saw was no longer the empty Mournful Emperor realm.</p><p>On the contrary!</p><p>The crown of the ugly and ferocious ancient japonicum was actually made up of countless vengeful souls and ghosts.</p><p>Broken, dismal, indescribable, dense terrifying spirits hung on the tree’s branches.</p><p>Their mournful cries turned into the howling of the wind.</p><p>There was a drizzle and it was the sound of the blood that dripped from those souls.</p><p>This was not the human world, but a filthy and depraved endless purgatory!</p><p>Hua Changdeng shook his head slightly and there was no fear in his voice. He slowly raised the famed sword, Ghost Hunter, in his hand and said:</p><p>“Hunting down ghosts with a lantern, this will be a long night.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
