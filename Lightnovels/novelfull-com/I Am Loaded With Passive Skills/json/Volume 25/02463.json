Bei Huai’s remnant soul had never carried out any sacrificial refining to this lost Divine Instrument, much less communicated with its divine spirit.</p><p>How could this thing defeat the void general who had fought the last battle on Abyss Island and wanted to live and die with his saber?</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>The Soul Scattering Nail shot over from afar and actually wanted to retaliate as it stabbed into Bei Huai’s remnant soul.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Bei Huai’s expression changed.</p><p>The lost Divine Instrument trembled and stopped its attack.</p><p>However, after the Soul Scattering Nail, there was also the void general Hong who suddenly released his form and transformed into a giant.</p><p>The general’s sword slashed at the central core!</p><p>In Ah Hong’s world, there was no Shengshen Continent. The only thing that mattered was its owner’s life and death.</p><p>When a single order was issued, even if the person in front of him was not Bei Huai’s remnant soul but his true body, he would still dare to draw his sword.</p><p>The people in the Qilin world and the Central Yuan world suddenly shuddered.</p><p>Most of them couldn’t see the void general Hong or the Holy Emperor Bei Huai’s remnant soul.</p><p>However, they could feel their souls suddenly turn cold and their death intent overflowed. There seemed to be an intangible sword that was about to slash down.</p><p>When the sword struck his head, Bei Huai’s remnant soul did not panic or dodge. He flicked his finger and pulled the nail away.</p><p>“There is no Saint below the Emperor, how dare you act rashly?”</p><p>Holy Emperor!</p><p>This was a realm.</p><p>The Ten High Nobles Holy Emperor’s demeanor was unfazed even with the cultivation of Bei Huai’s remnant soul.</p><p>Even though the void general’s sudden appearance was indeed frightening.</p><p>However, a Holy Emperor was a Holy Emperor, and a demi-saint was a demi-saint.</p><p>He was weak and he would not be able to withstand the demi-saint void general’s sword. With a shout, he activated his ability.</p><p>Even the 10,000 feet tall giant in his sword form was suspended in mid-air…</p><p>“Woo!”</p><p>A mournful cry resounded in all directions.</p><p>Even the people in the world below heard it and felt void general Hong’s grief.</p><p>It was helplessness, loneliness, and unwillingness…</p><p>It was the pain of being defeated, the grief of being unable to turn the tide, and the confusion of being unable to transcend time and reincarnation…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>He had forgotten that Bei Huai’s ability was to make people grieve and repent.</p><p>He had a second true body that could switch consciousness, but the void general was not spared.</p><p>An ordinary demi-saint would be helpless against a Holy Emperor, even if the Holy Emperor was only a remnant soul!</p><p>“Bei Huai…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gritted his teeth.</p><p>This was it!</p><p>Was this the only way?</p><p>“Hong!”</p><p>No matter how difficult it was for the Ultimate Giant to move, it could let out a long howl.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou was the Heavenly Ancestor’s descendant. He carried the body of the Heavenly Ancestor and inherited the will of the Heavenly Ancestor. He issued an order that only the void giant tribe could understand.</p><p>“Unwillingness, anger, helplessness… Any mortal can feel it, but you can’t!”</p><p>“My command is to fight this bloody battle to the end!”</p><p>Bei Huai’s remnant soul trembled, but he could not understand the contents of the voice.</p><p>But…</p><p>In the next moment, he saw the void general move as if it had been injected with chicken blood!</p><p>The will-o-wisps in void general Hong’s helmet clearly still shed blood and tears. However, it seemed to have cast off all forms of distracting thoughts and self-awareness as it charged forward without fear of death.</p><p>It swung its sword at the Holy Emperor.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Void general Hong had received the order!</p><p>This sword tore through the blue sky and darkened the world. It contained the power of the Heavenly Ancestor and devoured all the spirits in the world.</p><p>Bei Huai’s remnant soul had nowhere to run.</p><p>He watched in horror as the Soul Scattering Nail easily broke through the void general’s armor and pierced through its head.</p><p>However, the general’s sword slashed down from the top of his skull!</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>A sword split his soul.</p><p>Bei Huai’s remnant soul let out a mournful cry.</p><p>He couldn’t understand why Xu Xiaoshou had such special abilities.</p><p>How could such an unconscious and weak demi-saint be able to resist even the power of a single word from a Holy Emperor?</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was the Heavenly Ancestor’s descendant?</p><p>It was a wisp of a remnant soul and his thoughts could not be connected in time.</p><p>By the time he had the enlightenment, Bei Huai’s remnant soul was already powerless to change the situation.</p><p>Void general Hong turned into a desperate warrior and abandoned all thoughts about his own life and death.</p><p>The Soul Scattering Nail whistled back and forth as it pricked its body all over and turned it into a hornet’s nest.</p><p>However, void general Hong continued to slash. It was as if even if he died, he wanted to smash Bei Huai’s remnant soul into pieces.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Fight! Until the end!</p><p>Blood! Till the last drop!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
