His skin rippled and sloughed off, layer by layer</p><p>Under the Holy Emperor’s Recoil, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but stagger back half a step.</p><p>“Ahh!”</p><p>Finally he heard something.</p><p>The exchange of blows had also come to an end.</p><p>The Divine was rooted to the spot and his back exploded with blood.</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin’s claw was frozen in midair, but its upper body still pressed down due to the inertia of the attack!</p><p>“Crackle crackle…”</p><p>The sound of exploding bones reverberated in the sky.</p><p>The Qilin’s claw was shattered by the two fists. It was as if the middle of the claw had been embedded into a pillar that supported the sky.</p><p>The Intangible ancient martial arts power penetrated and the wound under the Qilin’s claw began to swell and explode.</p><p>When the ancient martial arts pillar penetrated the front claws, broke the front body, and blasted through the back, blood rained down and brought a torrent of flesh and blood with it.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The sounds of pain echoed all around.</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin’s eyes flashed with unnatural shock as it was sent flying.</p><p>The ancient Saint beast that covered the sky was sent flying by the human’s fists!</p><p>“F*ck…”</p><p>“That can send it flying?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was so shocked that his pupils couldn’t stop trembling.</p><p>Divine Connection…</p><p>What did connection mean?</p><p>This was what it meant to be connected!</p><p>After The Divine’s punch, the Holy Emperor Qilin’s power was channeled and one of its front claws was maimed. This was an attack that was augmented by the Holy Emperor’s earth element power!</p><p>“What kind of combat strength is this?”</p><p>“What level was The Divine at ?”</p><p>“Is he really only a demi-saint and not a Holy Emperor?”</p><p>“If that’s true, doesn’t that mean he still has room for development? He is a demi-saint who can fight against a Holy Emperor, and a Holy Emperor can fight against the Tenth Ancestor?”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou even thought that he did not need to master the Hungry Ghost Path anymore. The Divine was just being humble. He could destroy the combination of the Holy Emperor Qilin and the Holy Emperor Bei Huai just by opening the Human Realm Dao.</p><p>But…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a closer look, and saw that The Divine didn’t look very well.</p><p>After his punch, his back exploded completely. His form was faintly discernible, as if he would soon turn into a virtual image and disappear.</p><p>“Here, my dear The Divine!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly leaped to the sky and offered the Holy Medicine with both hands. “Eat, eat this quickly. This is a great tonic! Even Greedy the Cat Spirit drooled over this!”</p><p>The Divine glanced at him. His injuries from this punch might have been a little serious. His cheeks bulged noticeably and he wanted to say something, but he spat out blood.</p><p>After he glared at the little brat, The Divine did not refuse and swallowed the Holy Medicine in three bites.</p><p>“Woo…”</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin’s wails resounded in all directions.</p><p>In the next second, the shackles on its front claws lit up. What was attached to them was the phantom of the Azure dragon of the Four Symbols seal.</p><p>“What a great ancient martial arts!”</p><p>Bei Huai praised it openly.</p><p>At the same time, the phantom of the Azure Dragon burst into tears. It used its Holy Emperor’s wood element power and injected it into the Qilin’s wounds.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>The holy land Qilin’s injured body recovered visibly at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>Bei Huai, who used it as a host, was not affected by the heavy punch from before.</p><p>“This is really a f*cking monster…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the virtual image of the Azure Dragon that was also controlled by Bei Huai and was speechless.</p><p>It wasn’t just an earth element power. Since the Holy Emperor Qilin could use the wood element power to heal, it could probably use the other three elements as well.</p><p>“Five Elements Qilin…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to realize something.</p><p>The Four Symbols Seal had long been broken by Bei Huai!</p><p>The power of the four symbols had long been grasped by the Holy Emperor Qilin!</p><p>What The Divine had to face was not only the Earth Qilin, but the Five Elements Qilin that was not in good condition but had the power of the other four symbols!</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>The other claw let out a cackle, and the White Tiger wailed.</p><p>At the same time, the Holy Emperor Qilin seemed to be covered in a layer of golden scales. Its sharp claws tore through the sky and earth.</p><p>Bei Huai’s voice floated down.</p><p>“The Holy Emperor Qilin has already formed a connection with the five elements. It’s not in a good state right now, but its strength is endless.”</p><p>“Although your fists are strong, how many more punches can you throw?”</p><p>The dark blue eyes of the Qilin turned and looked at Xu Xiaoshou. It was as if it could see through the past and said in a mocking tone.</p><p>“The herbs in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer were given to you. Can you still turn them into the Divine Farmer Hundred Grass and provide an endless supply for the ancient martial art practitioner?”</p><p>After The Divine swallowed the Holy Medicine, his eyes sparkled.</p><p>He was not affected by Bei Huai’s words. Instead, he ignored him and looked directly at Xu Xiaoshou behind him.</p><p>“How’s your comprehension?”</p><p>“Quite rewarding.”</p><p>“Then let’s continue?”</p><p>“Let’s continue!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
