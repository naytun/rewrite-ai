After they glanced at each other, they realized that the situation in Yougui Pavilion was about to change.</p><p>“You can leave now.” Aunt Xiang waved her hand and it was obvious that she did not want to say anything more. “Let the others in.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The two women nodded and did not even dare to ask further. They left the room.</p><p>Soon, the door was pushed open again. This time, three beautiful women entered. They were Xiang Yaoyao’s three closest female attendants.</p><p>When the room quietened down.</p><p>Aunt Xiang’s gaze swept across the three women, who looked utterly bewildered and said indifferently.</p><p>“When did all of you enter Yougui Pavilion?”</p><p>With a few bangs, the three women knelt on the ground at the same time. Their delicate bodies trembled slightly, and panic appeared on their faces. Fortunately, they could still speak normally.</p><p>“Dongdong entered the Yougui Pavilion at the age of one. It has been twenty-eight years since then…”</p><p>“Aunt Xiang, Mei’er has been with you for 26 years. Did Mei’er do something wrong again?”</p><p>“Ah Yao, Ah Yao has been with Aunt Xiang since she was young till now…”</p><p>Aunt Xiang closed her eyes. After she quelled the turmoil in her heart, she said calmly.</p><p>“One of you betrayed me.”</p><p>With a few thuds, the three women fell to the ground at the same time and looked at each other in disbelief.</p><p>“Aunt Xiang!”</p><p>“Aunt Xiang, it’s not…”</p><p>“Ke ke…”</p><p>Even Mei’er, who was the most timid and had made the most mistakes gritted her teeth and couldn’t speak.</p><p>“However, I don’t blame you.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang threw out three more rings in front of the trio.</p><p>“After all, I have used you all. I am even more unwilling to point out who the traitor is at this moment. I believe that you have no choice but to work for that person.”</p><p>“I truly believe that not only will I remember our ten years of friendship, you will as well.”</p><p>Her gaze swept across the three women’s tearful faces. She sighed and said, “Take the rings and leave Yougui Pavilion. We will never meet again.”</p><p>“Aunt Xiang!”</p><p>Ah Yao cried out pitifully and shook her head as tears streamed down her face.</p><p>She couldn’t leave Yougui Pavilion.</p><p>Everything she had was given to her by Aunt Xiang, and it all came from this warm family.</p><p>A mortal of such beauty, what would happen after she left the Yougui Pavilion?</p><p>“Aunt Xiang, Dongdong can’t leave you.”</p><p>Dongdong kowtowed and ignored the ring.</p><p>If Ah Yao was like this, would it not be the same for her?</p><p>After she left the Yougui Pavilion, she had no other place to stay!</p><p>“Aunt Xiang! Mei’er is not a traitor. Mei’er has done many wrong things, but at least…”</p><p>Mei’er wiped her tears with her small hands and sobbed.</p><p>“At least, let Mei’er serve you until the end of her life!</p><p>“Very good. That was just a test.”</p><p>“And all of you have passed the test.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang suddenly nodded, then glanced at Ah Yao, whose hair was a little messy, and asked.</p><p>“Where’s your pipa?”</p><p>“I remember that your pipa never leaves your side.”</p><p>Ah Yao shook her head repeatedly and cried, “The backyard… It’s still in the backyard. Ah Yao was in a hurry…”</p><p>She was halfway through her makeup when she heard Aunt Xiang’s stern order. She immediately left everything and rushed over.</p><p>Pipa?</p><p>Where would she have the time to care about that pipa?</p><p>“Yougui Pavilion is in danger. Go back and get your things.”</p><p>“In half an hour, meet me at Dong Ji Teahouse on Chaoling Street at the Southern Zone gate. We will leave together.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang waved her hand and gave her last order.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The three women hurriedly got up and left to pack their things.</p><p>“Put on the rings.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The three women hurriedly turned around and each picked up a ring. They bowed and left.</p><p>When the door closed again, Aunt Xiang sighed.</p><p>How did she know that there was a traitor?</p><p>She had just arrived from Cross Corner Street and returned to Yougui Pavilion.</p><p>The only thing she knew was that it didn’t matter if she thought there was one or not. What was important was that it was right under Dao Qiongcang’s nose. There was definitely one at Yougui Pavilion!</p><p>“Don’t disappoint me…”</p><p>“It absolutely, absolutely can’t be you guys…”</p><p>She hoped so.</p><p>Aunt Xiang understood.</p><p>If Dao Qiongcang made a move, if it was not her closest female servant, how could she be worthy to be his chess piece?</p><p>“Snow…”</p><p>Aunt Xiang was deep in thought as she stared at the snow outside the window for ten breaths.</p><p>After so many years of intelligence work, in the end, she could not even trust the people closest to her.</p><p>After the storm subsided, Aunt Xiang took out a crumpled jade talisman from her sleeve.</p><p>This was a communication jade talisman.</p><p>It was too crude. It couldn’t even be considered a communication bead. It could only be used for a one-way communication.</p><p>It came from an average-looking coachman who had been a regular customer of Yougui Pavilion recently.</p><p>Southern Zone, Chaoling Street, Dong Ji Teahouse.</p><p>With a rumble, an explosion came from afar and caused all the tea drinkers in the teahouse to spill their tea.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“There are still people who dare to cause trouble under the Emperor’s feet?”</p><p>“When you look at this direction, it’s probably Changle Street. Are the Spiritual Cultivators fighting?”</p><p>“There’s a lot of smoke…”</p><p>That explosion had clearly blown up the protective spiritual array somewhere and damaged the inner foundation for it to cause such a shocking commotion.</p><p>Dongdong, who was in disguise, landed in the alley behind the teahouse. She looked up with sadness.</p><p>At this moment, she knew that Yougui Pavilion was gone.</p><p>If Aunt Xiang did not turn up, she would have lost that home forever.</p><p>If Aunt Xiang did not turn up, then it would be the Holy Divine Guards and even the white-clothed people who would arrive.</p><p>Dongdong took off the sealing bracelet on her wrist. Her aura rose steadily and soon rose to the higher void level.</p><p>“Aunt Xiang…”</p><p>In front of the candied haw store opposite the teahouse, Mei’er looked back as tears sparkled in her eyes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
