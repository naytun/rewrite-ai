This, together with the White Bone Giant that towered into the sky made an overwhelming impact.</p><p>Not to mention, Xu Xiaoshou’s statement revealed another message.</p><p>“Bei Huai, Holy Emperor!”</p><p>“That Qilin? Was its combat strength that of a Holy Emperor? Was it Bei Huai?”</p><p>“The battle today isn’t just a battle between demi-saints. It’s even a battle between Holy Emperors?”</p><p>The people in the Qilin world were completely dumbfounded.</p><p>This was not what mattered. The most important thing was…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had just slain the lower demi-saint Rao Yaoyao in Yunlun and was suspected by the world of having borrowed the other mighty powers of the Sky City, still lacked something…</p><p>After just a month, he was dissatisfied.</p><p>He fought the Holy Emperor!</p><p>He even crossed eras and fought Bei Huai!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>“How was that possible?”</p><p>“Was it really not a fool’s dream?”</p><p>The arrogant words that resounded throughout the Qilin world were also transmitted into the Four Symbols Secret Realm through the hole in the sky.</p><p>Ninety-nine percent of the Spiritual Cultivators in the outside world wouldn’t be able to understand what this enlightenment meant. After all, most people were limited by their horizons and couldn’t fathom the combat strength of a Holy Emperor.</p><p>In the Four Symbols Secret Realm, the geniuses of the five regions, who were the future Saint seedlings of the Holy Palace, finally understood how terrifying the person who could roar in front of the Holy Emperor Bei Huai was.</p><p>And what was most distressing was that …</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a young man who was supposed to be undergoing trials in the Four Symbols Secret Realm!</p><p>“At his age, how can he be so, so…”</p><p>There was no way to describe this phenomenon in the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>All the geniuses of the same generation in the Four Symbols Secret Realm felt the enormity of the phenomenon at this moment.</p><p>Just based on this sentence…</p><p>Even if they ignored the power of that attack, he had the sheer audacity to shout out that statement in front of the Holy Emperor!</p><p>The older generation looked at themselves and felt that they were old. They really witnessed the arrival of a new era.</p><p>The new generation, on the other hand, felt a bit of pressure from the Ten High Nobles that suppressed all the geniuses of the previous generation and even the pressure of the Eighth Sword Deity.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you’re the best.”</p><p>“It’s hard to catch up to him, even with the strength of a lifetime!”</p><p>“+(Watched, Passive Points+)+9999.”</p><p>“+(Sighed over. Passive Points), +9999.”</p><p>“+(In Awe, Passive Points+) +9999.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was about to explode with joy.</p><p>At the Acquired Stage, he once had a wild dream. He wanted to stand in the middle of a stage with tens of thousands of people and shout to the spectators, “I’m an Innate Stage master!”</p><p>At that time, he believed that his Passive Points would increase by 10,000 points.</p><p>Now, he had established himself in the Qilin world and revealed his identity in front of millions of spectators. He no longer had to hide anything.</p><p>“The me of today is no longer the me of the past.”</p><p>“After I obtained the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy, why do I need to hide like those rats around Bazhun’an?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was bowled over by this great momentum as he glanced at the world.</p><p>His current act of sensationalism no longer earned him suspicion and contempt, but awe and respect!</p><p>Of course, the most important fact was…</p><p>“+(Passive Points): 6214443.”</p><p>After the addition of points, his Passive Points dropped to five digits. With a shout, it increased by six million!</p><p>Six million…</p><p>This was just the beginning!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to have such a beautiful dream even when he had his illusions!</p><p>There was a limit to the number of messages in the Information Bar. It could only be “+9999 ”</p><p>However, in the Spiritual Cultivator world, it was virtually limitless.</p><p>Even if a person could only contribute a few Passive Point at a time, it would be difficult for their emotions to fluctuate after that.</p><p>However, he could not handle such a large number!</p><p>The speed at which the Information Bar was flooded was something that Xu Xiaoshou had never seen before in his life. He was amazed!</p><p>He had saved Greedy the Cat Spirt and could have left, but he had to stay and do this.</p><p>In his heart, other than verifying what he had learned, wasn’t there only this moment?</p><p>“Just this one vote!”</p><p>“After this, I’ll wash my hands of it and never be reckless again!”</p><p>“Huai baby… I will kill you!”</p><p>Sleeveless, Heavenly Ancestor Red Scorched Hand!</p><p>When the withered and charred black hand pressed down.</p><p>When the eyes of the White Bone Giant flashed with madness, passion, and even an inexplicable ‘obsession’…</p><p>No matter how shocked the outsiders were, it could not be compared to Bei Huai’s horror!</p><p>“Power of the ancestral source…”</p><p>“Penetrating Divine Senses…”</p><p>“It should be a special giant physique that was a combination of the ancient martial arts, the Human Realm Dao, and the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy…”</p><p>He was just a small Sovereign Dao Ream. Bei Huai really was not aware that Xu Xiaoshou could completely fuse these three extreme powers to form such an attack.</p><p>Such talent…</p><p>Bei Huai seemed to see the emergence of the talents in the War of the the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>With this move, Xu Xiaoshou would be able to win a spot in the competition.</p><p>This was a genius that transcended generations!</p><p>Just now, he had not only underestimated him, he had greatly underestimated him!</p><p>“But…”</p><p>“He clearly has such power, but why did he fear me like a lion or a tiger, and was so humble?”</p><p>There was no time to think!</p><p>The Heavenly Ancestor’s hand pressed down and seized the opportunity when the Senluo Realm couldn’t cover the White Bone Giant.</p><p>How could he give Bei Huai the chance to think of a way to escape?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
