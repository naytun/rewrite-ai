This kind of power is something that the Holy Divine Palace desired.”</p><p>“If the Holy Emperor Bei Huai did the research on the organization of the red-clothed people, the Black Hand behind the scene would have the answer.”</p><p>“Bei Huai really has the qualifications!”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou was enlightened and his thoughts were all connected.</p><p>But sometimes, being too smart and knowledgeable was not necessarily a good thing.</p><p>Through his Perception, he looked at the tiny human Bei Huai beneath the two giant beasts. It was as if he had seen the Black Hand behind the scenes outside the fantasy realm of the Weaving Expertise. He felt extremely cold, as if he had fallen into an ice cellar.</p><p>“The Holy Emperor had a need, so his weapon is the red-clothed people.”</p><p>“In order for the red-clothed people to exist, it must satisfy justice. Hence, there were the ghost beasts – born to slay evil!</p><p>“There are two types of ghost beasts. One is a beast born in an extradimensional space, either righteous or evil. The other is someone like Feng Yujin who is forcefully defined as a ghost beast, regardless whether it’s black or white.”</p><p>“However, if the red-clothed people knew too much, their swords would definitely hesitate. Thus, there were people who believed that ‘all ghosts beasts are evil’ like the Night Guardian. People like them could be the most ruthless and decisive.”</p><p>“If the public knew about the ghost beasts, the more they understood, the more likely it was that the secret would be discovered. Therefore, even the term ‘ghost beast’ is taboo in the five regions, and everyone is silent about the situation of the Three Seals.”</p><p>“Even Liu Changqing, who was at the Cutting Path Stage, risked his life to search for the secrets of the ghost beast after being parasitized by Xuan Wuji. It was as if they were not curious about the Ghost Beast at all from the moment of birth till their deaths…”</p><p>“Yes, it involved the Holy Emperor. With the Holy Emperor’s guidance and the power of oblivion, who would be interested in a ghost beast for no reason?”</p><p>The more Xu Xiaoshou thought about it, the more terrified he became. The more he looked at Bei Huai, the more he felt that this person was the true terror of the world!</p><p>From the first time he came into contact with the red-clothed night guardian in the City Lord Mansion in Tiansang City, to the time he was on the same side as the ghost beast and stood on the opposite side of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>All the secrets and discoveries related to the ghost beast were combined together at this moment. They pieced together into a picture that was still incomplete, but had already become a picture. It gave people a feeling that they had comprehended and seen it, and their brains were about to explode.</p><p>Everything pointed to Bei Huai.</p><p>Before this, Xu Xiaoshou only had a one line impression of Bei Huai. “Even if Bei Huai doesn’t cry, the Heavens will hurt.”</p><p>That was all!</p><p>There was nothing else!</p><p>The Black Hand behind this had only surfaced at this moment. He was more like Water Ghost than Water Ghost himself!</p><p>“Bei Huai is looking for Greedy the Cat Spirit. What was his purpose?”</p><p>At this point, Xu Xiaoshou did not need to think too much to easily get the answer to this question.</p><p>The Holy Divine Palace’s research…</p><p>Or to put it more directly, Bei Huai’s secret research on the ghost beast and the Power of Demons and Beasts had undoubtedly been successful!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had a good memory.</p><p>He suddenly thought of the red-clothed night guardian whom he had encountered before.</p><p>The Cutting Path Stage dark attribute Night Guardian had once displayed an incredible power, the power of the Higher Void- Grand Vital Energy!</p><p>In the past, this would have been a surprise.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou let it go after a while.</p><p>There were many talents in the five regions, and there were even people who had comprehended the Penetrating Divine Senses.</p><p>What was there to be surprised about when the Cutting Path Stage Night Guardian had comprehended the power of the Higher Void -Grand Vital Energy that was the total opposite of the dark attribute?</p><p>Now that he thought about it, he should have continued to trace it back then!</p><p>The path of the Spiritual Cultivator was not very clear above the Holy Emperor level. Everyone had their own paths, but it was fixed at the level below the demi-saint.</p><p>How could a Cutting Path Stage comprehend the power of the Higher Void?</p><p>That was one of Bei Huai’s research, that was to bestow the power of a higher realm to a lower realm cultivator!</p><p>“The Night Guardian wore red and had this belief that all the ghost beasts were evil. He used the power that belonged to the ghost beasts, and he himself was not aware of it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s scalp turned icy. He felt that this world was too ridiculous!</p><p>He would rather admit that his speculation was wrong than imagine how devastated the respectable Elder Night Guardian would be when he discovered the truth!</p><p>However, that was not all…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also thought of the Power of Demons and Beasts that erupted from Lu Ke, one of the red-clothed people at the last moment when he fought for the Path Pattern Initial Stone in the White Cave.</p><p>“Night Guardian was one of the ‘test subjects’ that Bei Huai mentioned?”</p><p>“So, Lu Ke of the red-clothed people who was Gou Wuyue’s disciple, was also one of the test subjects?”</p><p>At this point, Xu Xiaoshou’s entire body went numb.</p><p>He forced these terrifying thoughts back and switched his thoughts to Greedy the Cat Spirit.</p><p>Humans were the carriers of Bei Huai’s research achievements.</p><p>What would the ghost beast experience in the process of this research? What would it become in the end?</p><p>“Was Greedy the Cat Spirit the ‘it’ he spoke about?”</p><p>“Bei Huai’s ultimate goal was to obtain whatever was in Greedy the Cat Spirit’s body?”</p><p>After the dark clouds passed, his thoughts quickly became clear.</p><p>Apart from the power of the Three Loathsome Eyes and the Three Tribulation Eyes that even Bei Huai might not know about, Greedy the Cat Spirit possessed a powerful power:</p><p>Engulfing power!</p><p>Body of Devour!</p><p>Without a doubt, compared to the Lei Family’s Eyes, Bei Huai valued the swallow power more!</p><p>That’s right…</p><p>Now that he thought about it.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit was able to perfectly accommodate the two types of the Lei Family’s eyes. It could activate the power of the Lei Family’s Eyes without any adaptation process. This was the most extreme performance!</p><p>“If I were Bei Huai. I would also be tempted…”</p><p>Those who were involved were confused, while those who were not involved understood it clearly.</p><p>After he jumped out to take a look, Xu Xiaoshou realized that it was really a waste to only use Greedy the Cat Spirit to do the conducting alchemy and let it carry out 007’s work!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
