It’s Xiang’er that matters most.”</p><p>Xiang’er was insignificant; what truly mattered were the Spirit Crystals!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eye twitched, the pain already starting to ache in his flesh before he even bled…</p><p>Indeed, beasts weren’t easily coerced; the cost was steep!</p><p>But as he watched Bei Huai’s soul body gradually regain his mobility on the horizon, he sighed deeply:</p><p>“I’m sorry, The Divine, but I might have to offend you a little.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“From now on, until the end of the battle, you can consider me your Xiang’er.”</p><p>“?”</p><p>The Divine raised his eyebrows high, almost knocking this little imp to the ground with a punch.</p><p>Soon, he realized his misunderstanding.</p><p>With a flip of his hand, Xu Xiaoshou produced a Holy Medicine in his palm.</p><p>From the aura, one could easily tell it was the Holy Medicine to enhance the soul body—essential for activating the Hungry Ghost Path!</p><p>“You…”</p><p>The Divine was momentarily stunned.</p><p>He had only mentioned it casually, he hadn’t seen many Holy Medicines himself.</p><p>Xiang’er wasn’t that affluent; casually flipping out Holy Medicines just to keep him well-fed and opening the Six Paths at his whim.</p><p>Previously, even if The Divine had opened the Hungry Ghost Path, it was with large quantities of third or fourth-grade Sovereign stage spiritual medicines.</p><p>After all, the despicable beings who practiced the path of soul body were few.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>The expression on his face at this moment was clearly saying…</p><p>Me!</p><p>Xiang Yaoyao, the Ultimate Edition!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou swirled the Holy Medicine in his hand, feeling his confidence return.</p><p>He forcefully pulled back the golden throne beneath The Divine’s feet, threw his buttocks into it, and raised his chin. “So, how many punches can this unleash?”</p><p>Flames ignited in The Divine’s eyes, no longer concerned about closing doors or the throne. “With Holy Medicine, it’s one punch per dose, like before.”</p><p>“And now?” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up too, crossing his legs and flipping his hand, transforming one Holy Medicine into three roots of Soul Holy Medicine.</p><p>“Three punches!”</p><p>“And now?”</p><p>“Ten punches!”</p><p>“Let’s start with ten punches, and for every ten, you get one extra. You can nibble on the extras, and I have more if you’re having a blast!” Xu Xiaoshou said, with a pang of pain, as he handed over eleven roots of Soul Holy Medicine.</p><p>He dared not throw them.</p><p>He was just putting on a little show. If he really went too far, The Divine’s fist would crash down on his head—now that would be a real headache!</p><p>The Divine couldn’t hold in his huge palms the eleven roots of Soul Holy Medicine of various shapes, some even resembling trees!</p><p>He didn’t even know the names of these eleven unfamiliar but definitely delicious things, but Xu Xiaoshou pulled them out like magic.</p><p>The Divine’s breathing became heavy and coarse.</p><p>He thought of the stingy Xiang Yaoyao and then looked at the generous Shou’er in front of him…</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“This is a bit wasteful. If you have enough Sovereign Stage medicines…”</p><p>“No need.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“My Apricot Realm doesn’t grow junk!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The Divine fell silent. He looked at this shining little devil and spoke again:</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“You, are a real man!”</p><p>On the throne, Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>He stood up abruptly, stomping heavily on the golden throne, making a loud sound.</p><p>He thumped his chest and, speaking with the tone of a gorilla, proclaimed:</p><p>“A real man speaks with Holy Medicine!”</p><p>Gulp~</p><p>In one gulp, The Divine swallowed one of Xu Xiaoshou’s hearts… no, Soul Holy Medicine!</p><p>His intoxicated expression, enamored gaze, and eyes longing for power… even Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but feel a lump in his throat.</p><p>Was it really that delicious?</p><p>Could he have a taste too?</p><p>“The Divine.”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“If, and I say if, you swallowed the ancestral tree…”</p><p>“Shut up!!!”</p><p>Before Xu Xiaoshou could finish speaking, the wary Dragon Apricot spirit within the Apricot Realm went mad, screaming in shock, fear, panic, and dread, “Say one more word, and I’ll detonate the Apricot Realm!”</p><p>—In order for this crazy human to understand in time, the Dragon Apricot spirit even used the human way of speaking, not daring to be pedantic.</p><p>Behave…</p><p>It was a metaphor, Apricot Treasure, alright?</p><p>He hadn’t even said anything yet, could it not jump to conclusions?</p><p>“Just a branch, I didn’t intend for him to swallow you entirely, and he doesn’t seem to enjoy gnawing on branches…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou! Are you not a man of your word?”</p><p>The spirit of the Dragon Apricot was going mad, how could he have such a master? “Are you chopping off an octopus’s tentacle, waiting for it to regenerate, then chopping it off again?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou covered his mouth in surprise, “I don’t have such cruel intention, Apricot Treasure.”</p><p>“You do!!!”</p><p>“I just feel sorry for the spiritual medicines in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer; they grow slowly after all.”</p><p>“Have you ever felt sorry for me???”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
