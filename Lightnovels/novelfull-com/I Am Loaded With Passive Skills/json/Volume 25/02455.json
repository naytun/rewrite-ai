It was the epitome of the word ‘passive’ in passive skills.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was tired but happy.</p><p>There had never been a moment when he felt that the Acalanātha of the first awakening was so magical that it was even more powerful than the Ultimate Giant and the Independence of the second awakening!</p><p>The backlash that both he and the enemy suffered after being bombed was the core of the Acalanatha!”</p><p>Now, he controlled the Qilin and Bei Huai suffered a backlash. He finally realized that the passive skills and awakened skills were not weak. It all depended on how they were used.</p><p>“You shouldn’t be greedy.”</p><p>“My lesson is a lesson for you.”</p><p>“Hu! Would you dare to be greedy for the second round? Do you really think that I, Xu Xiaoshou, am helpless?”</p><p>The Ultimate Giant murmured. As its voice rose, endless power gushed from its hands. Golden light erupted from them, and its posture became even more explosive!</p><p>The giant grabbed half of the Holy Emperor Qilin’s head and body in each hand, as if it clutched a small lobster.</p><p>Before it even exerted its strength, the spectators below felt their scalps go numb, as if they could foresee a bloody scene that was about to happen.</p><p>“No way…”</p><p>“No way, no way…”</p><p>“Is he crazy? Lord Shou has gone crazy? What did he want to do? His actions…”</p><p>It was not just the Qilin world.</p><p>Within the Four Symbols Secret Realm, those who witnessed this scene felt chills run down their spines.</p><p>That monstrous Holy Emperor Qilin was big enough, but it was like a dead dog in the hands of the Ultimate Giant. It could not put up any resistance at all!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen tilted her head but couldn’t bear to look at him.</p><p>However, when she thought about how Bei Huai had used his Hand of the Divine Soul to attack him mercilessly in an attempt to kill him…</p><p>Yu Zhiwen held the astrolabe tightly and turned her head away, but her eyes never left the scene on the Heaven Secrets Curtain.</p><p>A man’s life was short.</p><p>Yu was like that too. She could get angry too!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>“We cannot let him off…”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A change occurred in the battle.</p><p>Just when everyone thought that the Holy Emperor Qilin was completely defenseless.</p><p>The Qilin’s mouth opened slightly from the immense pressure. Suddenly a dark green light shot out from within and headed toward the Ultimate Giant’s head.</p><p>“Soul Scattering Nail!”</p><p>It was a nail.</p><p>It was also a soul body spiritual weapon.</p><p>It was ranked among the Inscription Stele and was a long lost Divine Instrument!</p><p>It did not belong to Bei Huai’s remnant thought, and it was not even worthy of being refined into a contract.</p><p>Instead, he had placed it in the soul body of the Holy Emperor Qilin in advance. Even if he didn’t need it, he wanted to keep it as a backup.</p><p>He didn’t expect to use it on a Sovereign Dao Realm.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen blurted out from the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>Her reaction speed was extremely slow. It was only after the sneak attack grazed the giant that she realized that the situation was not good. She quickly shut her mouth and pretended she had not said anything.</p><p>Fortunately, everyone’s attention was on the battle and they did not pay attention to an outsider like her.</p><p>Of course, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t hear this warning.</p><p>However, the Ultimate Giant’s head tilted slightly when the Soul Scattering Nail shot over.</p><p>The world was silent at this moment.</p><p>The Soul Scattering Nail grazed a corner of its soul body and brushed past its cheek, and left a small wound.</p><p>However, this wasn’t a side collision.</p><p>Instead, it was injured by the violent force of this attack and the strong wind of the soul body that blew over After all, Xu Xiaoshou’s soul body was weak to begin with.</p><p>A black scar appeared on the Ultimate Giant’s face. It was the manifestation of the soul that was injured in the physical body.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed.</p><p>He had activated his Moment of Enlightenment!</p><p>He had been tricked before!</p><p>When the Soul Scattering Nail shot out, there wasn’t even a notification of a ‘sneak attack’ in the Information Bar. It was an indication of how careless Xu Xiaoshou was.</p><p>He felt that the Ten High Nobles Holy Emperor Bei Huai, should be able to drag his enemies down to hell with him even if he was at the end of his tether based on his combat strength just now.</p><p>How could he not be on guard?</p><p>“Just this?”</p><p>“Just this, just this, just this?”</p><p>The Ultimate Giant exerted force with both hands. Before the people of the world could react, it had already dodged the sneak attack that tore apart the two opposing sides.</p><p>“If that’s the case, I’m going to tear the Qilin apart and kill the Holy Emperor today!”</p><p>Sizzle.</p><p>Blood splattered as its bones and flesh disintegrated.</p><p>The Holy Emperor Qilin was like a delicious crayfish. Even its scales could not stop the force from tearing it apart, and it was torn into two by the Ultimate Giant.</p><p>Its head and body parted!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
