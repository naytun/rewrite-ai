Who was she talking to?”</p><p>The loud and clear shout spread in all directions and caused a lot of confusion.</p><p>After the trial-takers and trial officers scrambled up from the ground, they looked all around but they could not find anyone.</p><p>“Wait…”</p><p>However, there were still many people who were interested.</p><p>The trial-takers who could enter the Four Symbols Secret Realm and the guardians of the trial-takers were all extraordinary people.</p><p>This sentence was like a key that broke the seal. It quickly opened everyone’s sealed memories and connected everything together.</p><p>“The Ten High Nobles, the Bei Huai who even if he did not cry, the Heavens will hurt?”</p><p>“That’s right. I wondered why there were tears on my face. Everyone had tears too. But now that I think about it, it seems that I had too much to drink. I can’t remember why I cried just now.”</p><p>“It’s the ability of the sad higher void… No, sad demi-saint? Or could it be…That’s impossible, right? Above the demi-saint?”</p><p>“Strange. If the demi-saint Beihuai was here, why aren’t we crying now? I heard that wherever he goes, even the sky will cry!”</p><p>“What was Miss Zhiwen looking at?”</p><p>When they followed the direction of Yu Zhiwen’s gaze when she jumped down from the sky, everyone looked up and did not see anything.</p><p>Only a small number of people realized something as they had cultivated similar abilities. More or less, the power of the soul body surged in their bodies and eyes.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>In just an instant, the expressions of this group of people changed drastically.</p><p>“What a terrifying soul body!”</p><p>The soul body that was invisible to the naked eye was actually larger than the sky that hung above everyone’s heads and resembled a human-shaped soul mountain. It pressed down on them until they could not breathe!</p><p>Bei Huai’s ‘sadness’ power no longer affected the trial-takers because he deliberately restrained it to prevent too much of a negative effect that caused them to cry themselves to death.</p><p>He did not expect that someone, especially someone from the Holy Divine Palace, would point out his identity in front of everyone!</p><p>“Wu wu…”</p><p>In an instant, the sounds of crying began again.</p><p>Soon, the cries turned into anguished wails. A small number of Dao of the soul Spiritual Cultivators cried so hard that their tears turned blood-red.</p><p>If you don’t look at it, you’ll just be confused. If you don’t know what it was, you would not be harmed.</p><p>If you look, you would get hurt. It was difficult for the Saint to tolerate those who offended the Holy Path.</p><p>This was the ‘protection’ that Bei Huai had set up for mortals. It had already weakened the backlash from the Saints on the other side of the Holy Path.</p><p>Just now, the other party was too weak and her soul did not explode instantly because she was actually ‘protected’.</p><p>However, if it wasn’t for that cry, these people wouldn’t have had to suffer such injuries.</p><p>“Had ulterior motives?”</p><p>Bei Huai’s soul body remained calm, but his gaze followed the voice and looked at the woman who had spoken. All the information about this woman’s identity flashed through his mind.</p><p>He knew this little girl called Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>She was Dao Xuanji’s beloved disciple, Yu Kunpeng’s great-granddaughter, a Divine Sorceress and possessor of the Pearl Gem Star Eyes. She had a weak personality but was extremely intelligent.</p><p>Moreover, she was not an enemy.</p><p>“Do you know what you just did?”</p><p>Bei Huai’s eyes turned cold as he sent a telepathic communication through his soul body. It was as if Mount Tai pressed down on Yu Zhiwen that caused her to be momentarily dazed. Her delicate body swayed in the air and she almost fell.</p><p>Her Pearl Gem Star Eyes lit up and Yu Zhiwen regained her senses.</p><p>She turned around and saw that more than ten people had prostrated themselves on the ground because of what she had just said. Blood gushed out of their seven orifices, their faces were bruised, and they were all in a dispirited state.</p><p>Because I… Yu Zhiwen’s face turned bitter as she condemned herself and wanted to retreat.</p><p>However, she knew very well that it was not all because of her.</p><p>The appearance of the Holy Emperor here was a ‘mistake’, not to mention that Bei Huai had revealed his power before.</p><p>He definitely wanted to do something, such as targeting Xu Xiaoshou’s cat…</p><p>Even if they didn’t deliberately affect the ordinary people around them, they would still be affected.</p><p>This was the butterfly effect!</p><p>A Holy Emperor was too powerful.</p><p>As soon as Bei Huai left the Holy Emperor secret realm, the intangible power of guidance had affected the Four Symbols Secret Realm and even the Shengshen Continent outside.</p><p>“I injured more than ten people with just one shout.”</p><p>“If I had not said anything, Bei Huai would continue to stay here. Xu Xiaoshou won’t just wait for death… At that time, everyone in the Vermilion Bird lineage will die because of this.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen stopped her retreat and looked over. Her face was filled with fear, but she had an extremely firm look in her eyes.</p><p>Before she jumped, she had already prepared many words in her mind, be it idle chatter or greetings…</p><p>However, when Bei Huai’s gaze landed on her, Yu Zhiwen realized that she could no longer beat around the bush. All she could say was.</p><p>“Senior Bei Huai, a Holy Emperor is not allowed to launch attacks on the Shengshen Continent. This is the rule!”</p><p>All the discussions stopped abruptly.</p><p>Everyone even thought that they had misheard. What did Yu Zhiwen just say?</p><p>“Holy Emperor?”</p><p>“Bei Huai is a Holy Emperor?”</p><p>At this moment, everyone looked horrified.</p><p>If it were any other ordinary Spiritual Cultivator, they would probably have to recall what level a Holy Emperor was. Shouldn’t one who was at the peak of the continent be a demi-saint?</p><p>However, everyone here was at the peak level in the five regions. They all had their own legacies and horizons, so they more or less were familiar with the Holy Emperor State.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Everyone fled in panic, as if they had encountered a plague.</p><p>It didn’t matter why the Holy Emperor Bei Huai had appeared here or whether he had appeared or not.</p><p>When it came to matters of this level, all their family members and clan elders had already told them:</p><p>“Run as far as you can!”</p><p>Bei Huai did not stop the trial-takers and trial officers when they made their escape. These people were not the target.</p><p>He only stared at the stubborn little girl’s boiling spirit with interest. The degree of fluctuation in her thoughts was even more than Xu Xiaoshou’s. It was like a volcano that was about to erupt.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
