(Part 1)</p><p>“Master Siren?”</p><p>“Master Siren?”</p><p>“Wake up, Master Siren. Aren’t you protecting me? Why are you in a daze?”</p><p>This was too irresponsible. Xu Xiaoshou had already ended the state of cultivating the Heart Sword Technique and returned to reality. When he turned around, he discovered that he wasn’t the only one who had gone mad. Mei Siren had also gone mad.</p><p>He didn’t dare to act rashly.</p><p>After waiting for a long time, when the situation had improved, he patted Mei Siren for a long time before the old Sword Deity regained his senses from his dazed state.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>As a result, as soon as Mei Siren opened his eyes, a monstrous devilish energy suddenly burst out again, instantly enveloping a radius of hundreds of miles. At the same time, the sword image behind him rose out of thin air, and with cold killing intent, it slashed at the head.</p><p>Ambushed, Passive Points +1.</p><p>“F*ck!” Xu Xiaoshou’s heart almost flew out of his chest. Without saying a word, he used the Vanishing Technique and shifted his body to the side. He stared blankly at Master Siren’s sword image attack, which was slashing down at his original position.</p><p>He showed no mercy!</p><p>The sword energy traveled for thousands of miles, tearing a bright passage in the Kingdom of Giants and destroying countless ancient buildings before it disappeared in the horizon.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was confused.</p><p>A drop of cold sweat rolled down his forehead. Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>What was this?</p><p>“Master Siren, you really wanted to kill me just now, right?</p><p>“What did I do? I only patted you twice, right? I even considerately covered my palm with spiritual energy. I hope it didn’t hurt you!</p><p>“Why did it have to be like this?”</p><p>“Ugh…” his eyes regained their clarity, and the demonic aura faded. Mei Siren, who seemed to have finally regained consciousness, looked at the sword that he had just slashed out and was also stunned.</p><p>“What did I do?”</p><p>At this moment, Mei Siren almost wanted to hold his head and shout.</p><p>Was Xu Xiaoshou dead?</p><p>Was he killed by his sword?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?” He looked around and tried to call out, “Xu Xiaoshou, where are you?”</p><p>There was no response.</p><p>Regret suddenly appeared in Mei Siren’s eyes. He clutched the stone sword in his hand tightly and muttered to himself, ” “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I didn’t control myself…”</p><p>“Master Siren?” At this moment, a bewildered voice sounded behind him.</p><p>Mei Siren suddenly turned around and saw Xu Xiaoshou standing behind him unscathed. His eyes immediately widened.</p><p>“You little thing!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The stone sword hit the top of his head, and Xu Xiaoshou felt a huge force with a rebound.</p><p>His passive skills, recoil, and toughness were also nullified at this moment, and his body was blasted into the deep pit.</p><p>What was this?</p><p>Shock Path?</p><p>With doubt in his heart, Xu Xiaoshou clutched his head and flew back up. With an aggrieved expression, he asked, “Why are you hitting me, Master Siren? You wanted to kill me first, so I could only disappear and dodge.”</p><p>“You a*shole!” Mei Siren was furious. He was really frightened just now. He really thought that he had killed Xu Xiaoshou after losing control.</p><p>After all, Xu Xiaoshou was only a Master. No matter how powerful he was, he would not be able to take a blow from his sword image.</p><p>Don’t be angry, he told himself.</p><p>It’s good that he’s not dead, and everything is fine.</p><p>Mei Siren tried hard to calm down and thought of what he had done in Xu Xiaoshou’s spiritual world. He shook his head slightly and decided not to think about it anymore.</p><p>“What happened to Master Siren before? Why were you standing in the same place and couldn’t be woken up? What’s wrong?” Xu Xiaoshou asked softly, his eyes full of curiosity and innocence.</p><p>“You even called me? Then, how long have I been there?” Mei Siren was stunned. His old face blushed, but he calmed down in the blink of an eye. He coughed and said, “I’m dazed. How long have you been thinking?”</p><p>“About ten breaths. When I woke up and turned around, I saw you in a daze. What is it that you need so long to think about?” Xu Xiaoshou blinked his eyes. He looked innocent, but in fact, he was on high alert. He was ready to retreat immediately if he provoked the old Sword Deity.</p><p>Was he stunned for more than ten breaths?</p><p>When Mei Siren heard this, he was stunned on the spot. He asked again, “Then, did you see anything abnormal?”</p><p>“Abnormal?” Xu Xiaoshou tilted his head and thought for a moment. “Nothing was amiss…”</p><p>“That’s good. That’s good.” Mei Siren heaved a sigh of relief. The scene of being controlled by the devilish energy and fighting with the inner demon You Tu for 300 rounds flashed in his mind again. He felt extremely ashamed.</p><p>“I, the Seven Sword Deity, have just killed Jiang Buyi’s demi-saint incarnation. Now, I’ve been controlled by Xu Xiaoshou’s Heart Sword Technique!</p><p>“Although it was because I was not prepared, it is clear that the results of this kid’s cultivation are indeed something.</p><p>“The inner demon…” Mei Siren sighed in his heart and decided not to talk about this matter anymore.</p><p>Suddenly, Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have remembered something. He patted his head and said, “By the way, if we really want to talk about ‘abnormality’, there’s a little. Master Siren, the devilish energy that emerged from your body just now, does it count? That’s scary!”</p><p>“Uh,” Mei Siren’s face stiffened, and he suddenly had a bad feeling.</p><p>“I thought it was Master Siren who had cultivation deviation, but on second thought, it’s impossible. You are protecting me, how could you have cultivation deviation, right?” Xu Xiaoshou frowned and said after thinking for a while.</p><p>“Yes, I was indeed thinking about something.” Mei Siren’s voice unconsciously lowered. After he continued his sentence, he suddenly raised his eyes and asked, “You, besides seeing the devilish energy, did you hear anything else?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
