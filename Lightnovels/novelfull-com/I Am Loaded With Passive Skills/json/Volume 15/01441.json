The next second, Bazhun’an turned around and left with his wife.</p><p>Bazhun’an didn’t care if the kid at that time could understand it or not. Instead, he quickly planted the memories in his mind and let him slowly learn by himself as he grew.</p><p>This was how Xiao Kongtong grew up.</p><p>Many years later, he became a mature adult and founded an orphanage, House of Blessing. Moreover, he named the location Fringe Moon Immortal City, and he finally saw his Teacher for the second time.</p><p>It was during this second meeting that he received his second lesson on the Way of the Sword, which allowed him to comprehend Sword Cognition Incarnation.</p><p>Therefore, with such a crazy sword practice experience, Xiao Kongtong could see the situation more clearly.</p><p>It was impossible to count on a wanderer like his Teacher, Bazhun’an, to teach him the sword. Meeting a real Teacher like Mei Sirenren was a chance of a lifetime!</p><p>He did not understand.</p><p>He didn’t know what Xu Xiaoshou was thinking at this moment.</p><p>If it was him, he would just accept the sword and bow to Master Siren without hesitation!</p><p>However, everyone’s life experience was different. Xu Xiaoshou had no idea what was in Xiao Kongtong’s mind, and he didn’t even intend to know that.</p><p>At this moment, what Master Siren had said made his head full of questions.</p><p>He kept thinking about the proposal…</p><p>How could it be so simple?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was caught off guard by this situation, and he could only try his best to clear his chaotic and confused mind.</p><p>“Why is Master Siren willing to give me a second chance? Bazhun’an should not be able to convince him…”</p><p>“I already have a Master, and Elder Sang still needs me to save him. If he were here, would he give me permission to have another Master?”</p><p>“Master Siren brought Communication Talisman here and wanted to teach me the sword. Could there be some deeper meaning behind this? Could it be that Bazhun’an is trying to mess with me again? Is he up to something again?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind was in a spin.</p><p>His thoughts were a mess, without any order, and he couldn’t come up with any ideas.</p><p>However, in the next second, when Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were fixed on Master Siren’s sincere, clear, and pure eyes, the scattered thoughts in his mind disappeared like fireworks and dissipated into the vast void.</p><p>In front of him, there was only a stone sword that was still waiting and a smiling Teacher…</p><p>At this moment, the countless questions in his mind disappeared, and all of them turned into a conclusion.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, are you taking the sword or not? How long should Master Siren hold it? Are you waiting for him to have sore arms? Who do you think you are? Do you mean the Sword Deity should beg you to be his disciple?”</p><p>Thud!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickly stepped forward and took the stone sword from Master Siren.</p><p>This sword seemed simple, unremarkable, and light, but it was as heavy as a giant rock in his hand. The overwhelming weight made Xu Xiaoshou, who was talkative, turn silent and speechless.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>After holding it in for a while, his face turned red. All the messy thoughts in his mind had been answered after he took the sword, and there was no need to ask again.</p><p>He wanted this chance.</p><p>Master Siren was also willing to be his Teacher.</p><p>Wasn’t this the best outcome? Why did he need to consider anything else?</p><p>Holding the stone sword, Xu Xiaoshou could only utter a sentence in the end.</p><p>“My, my realization quality is very poor. I once practiced White Cloud Sword Technique for three years, but I only managed to master the first move. If Master Siren wants to teach me, I am afraid that…”</p><p>White Cloud Sword Technique?</p><p>Xiao Kongtong looked at Xu Xiaoshou from head to toe as if he had seen a ghost. He thought, what kind of secret technique or Saint Martial Arts is this?” Or is it something more powerful than the Teacher’s sword cognition?</p><p>Did it take Xu Xiaoshou three years to master the first move of the White Cloud Sword Technique with his Sword Will?</p><p>Mei Siren did not care about these words but laughed and took out his fan.</p><p>He flipped the fan, and a few words appeared, “Are you stupid?”</p><p>“What is my question?” Mei Siren said slowly.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, do you want to learn the sword” Xu Xiaoshou stared at the big words and a big question mark on the fan. He was still thinking whether it was intentional or a coincidence, but Master Siren’s question made him recall.</p><p>“So, other than this question, did I you anything else?” Mei Siren nodded and continued.</p><p>“No…” Xu Xiaoshou could finally speak after hesitating.</p><p>“Since that’s the case, just tell me whether you want to learn the sword. What are you hesitating for?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyes, and his consciousness finally returned to his body. His usual cleverness had finally come back, and he suddenly realized everything.</p><p>It was true that no one in this world could make Master Siren do anything, so it could only be his idea if he still wanted to teach the sword. It could not be the interference of any other person, not even the slightest bit!</p><p>“I understand.” Xu Xiaoshou opened his mouth.</p><p>“Moreover, your sword body is rare in the world. How can you not have talent in the Way of the Sword? ” The Mei Siren’s lips curled up, for he had noticed Xu Xiaoshou’s talent in the Way of the Sword when they were at First Pavilion in the Sky!</p><p>“Do I have a sword body?” Xu Xiaoshou was confused.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
