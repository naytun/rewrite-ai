I seem to be the only one who needs it badly? Just now, I was even afraid that they would snatch away the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer from Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>At that moment, Ye Xiaotian understood clearly how Xu Xiaoshou dared to take out three of the Holy Miracle Fruits in such a blatant manner. This fellow would never put himself in danger!</p><p>“I…” He tried to speak, but Ye Xiaotian found it difficult to take the Holy Miracle Fruit.</p><p>“Take it.” Mei Siren smiled warmly and said, “It is true that a Spiritual Cultivator would require a lot of resources. Even if you reach the higher void level you still need a lot of resources. You have mastered the Spatial Upanishad and have a good foundation. With the help of the Holy Miracle Fruit, your future achievements would be limitless.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou watched this scene calmly and did not utter a word. He thought to himself, “This is too much, so much so that even Master Dean found it difficult to speak. He clearly needs this thing very much.”</p><p>Without further ado, Xu Xiaoshou placed the Holy Miracle Fruit into Ye Xiaotian’s hands. At the same time, he raised his brows and chuckled. “Master Dean, you don’t have to be so polite with me. From the Spirit Palace till now, I have received more care than this. If I give you this Holy Miracle Fruit, it might come back to me in the future.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian remained silent, unable to refuse the gift of the Holy Miracle Fruit. He looked at the three of them and nodded. “Alright, I won’t stand on ceremony then.”</p><p>The Holy Miracle Fruit was a temptation to the Ancient Swordsman, but to the Spiritual Cultivator, it was a great supplement!</p><p>If he swallowed the Holy Miracle Fruit, he would even dare to arm wrestle with Huang Quan, as long as the other party did not imbibe any Holy Blood.</p><p>The increase in combat strength was more than double. There was no reason for Ye Xiaotian to reject it.</p><p>However, he felt ashamed when he accepted it. After all, he had not been of much help during this mission to rescue Xu Xiaoshou. After some thought, Ye Xiaotian took out the crystal gem.</p><p>“This is the Semi-Saint person.”</p><p>The three people beside him were dumbfounded.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>“Semi-Saint person?”</p><p>“I didn’t hear the wrong thing, did I? This was the key to the path of becoming a Saint. The Semi-Saint person?”</p><p>“Received shock. Passive value,+1.”</p><p>“Where did you get it?” Xu Xiaoshou looked at Master Dean in horror. “Why did it have to be like this? I have a lot of Holy Medicine in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer and I only gave you one Holy Miracle Fruit. You don’t have to do this!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian glanced at Xiao Kongtong and heaved a long sigh. “He wanted to trick me, but I didn’t expect that the last few hundred Stone Giants would be so easily dealt with by Demi-Saint Jiang.”</p><p>The Stone Giants… Xu Xiaoshou suddenly recalled the group of Giants that were even bigger than the Void Attendants that had followed Xiao Kongtong and Ye Xiaotian into the arena.</p><p>“Did you plunder someone’s nest? You’re even more ruthless than me, You’ve even gotten the Semi-Saint person.” Xu Xiaoshou was shocked and glanced at Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>“It was just a coincidence.” Xiao Kongtong laughed awkwardly. He did not dare to say that curiosity killed the cat. He only chuckled and said, “Fortunately, I have good self-control and gave away this hot potato in time.”</p><p>“You were well aware that this was a hot potato!” Ye Xiaotian was flustered. He was the only one with the Spatial Attributes. If someone else had received this thing, they would have been smashed into meat paste by the Stone Giants.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian suddenly thought of something and turned to look at Xu Xiaoshou with a serious expression. “That was before, but now it’s not a hot potato anymore. The Stone Giants have been dealt with. You won’t be in any danger with this thing.”</p><p>When he heard this, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know whether to take it or not.</p><p>He was only at the Master Stage and he had three more levels of the Sovereign Stage to go through in the future. He still had a long way to go before he became a Saint. It would be better not to take the Semi-Saint person.</p><p>If Elder Sang was still here, he would accept it and add a Demi-Saint Stage bodyguard to his list.</p><p>But now…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was an ambitious man. He had seen Yu Lingdi and witnessed Ye Xiaotian’s combat strength. He knew that the Sovereign Dao Realm was the key to his rise.</p><p>He also wanted to master the Upanishad power!</p><p>Perhaps, there was more than one type!</p><p>This might be difficult for others, but he had his ways and he believed that he could do it.</p><p>The time taken from the initial Dao realm for him to master the Upanishad level was simply too long.</p><p>It would be a waste to give him the Semi-Saint person, but not if it were given to Master Dean.</p><p>He only needed to eliminate the Cutting Path Stage, undergo the Nine Death Thunder Calamity, and use the Holy Miracle Fruit to enter the rank of the higher void level in the world. He would probably be even stronger than Water Ghost and Huang Quan.</p><p>With the Semi-Saint person that could allow him to become a Saint at any time, the continent could probably witness the birth of an extraordinary Demi-Saint. A Demi-Saint who had mastered the Spatial Upanishad. Wouldn’t that be destructive?</p><p>“I can’t take it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought it through and refused decisively, but he was still in shock.</p><p>What’s wrong with this world?</p><p>The higher void level were all ready to give up their lives for the Holy Miracle Fruit, and you guys want to shirk the responsibilities.</p><p>The Semi-Saint person was something that was not easily attained, but you still treat it as a ‘hot potato’ and passed it around?</p><p>Is it me or you guys who are sick? Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt that there was no normal person around him. What was the problem?</p><p>Ye Xiaotian insisted.</p><p>“That’s right, Xu Xiaoshou can’t take it,” Mei Siren suddenly said.</p><p>As soon as he said this, all of them looked over at the same time.</p><p>Mei Siren held his paper fan and it was evident he was shocked when Ye Xiaotian suddenly produced the Semi-Saint person. He had yet to recover from his shock.</p><p>However, he was in a good frame of mind and quickly shifted his emotions. He said, “You all know that Saints tend to conceal themselves for self-protection, but there was none for the Semi-Saint person. This thing was indeed a hot potato from before and will still be one in the future!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
