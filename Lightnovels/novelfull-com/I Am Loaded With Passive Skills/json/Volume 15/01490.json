He felt the world shrink inch by inch before his eyes, and he had reached the height of a giant.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>As the giant void general Hong’s body enlarged and the war drum was being beaten from behind, his voice pierced through the clouds. His words were filled with killing intent,</p><p>“Fight! Until the end!”</p><p>“Blood! To the last drop!”</p><p>With a boom, the long street exploded into pieces, and dust flew everywhere.</p><p>The square array of giants behind him released their restraints and transformed into black giants that were thousands of feet tall, not much different from the void attendants.</p><p>They raised their battle axes, halberds, and giant hammers high up in the air and roared loudly, their voices shaking the entire area.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>…</p><p>The scene changed.</p><p>Dust filled the air, and the battlefield was filled with killing intent.</p><p>The remains of the void general Fei, which was covered in green armor and black blood, had been impaled into the void by the Demon God’s great spear that Xu Xiaoshou had seen before. It was the one that Xiao Kongtong had stepped on when he was confronting the demi-saint Jiang Buyi.</p><p>It was dead!</p><p>It wasn’t just Fei who had died.</p><p>The ground was covered with the remains of giants. Broken limbs and corpses were scattered everywhere, and blood flowed all over the ground.</p><p>A great pain came from his body, and blood flowed out of his wounds. There was also the familiar power of devilish energy raging in his body. If it was a normal person, this power might have been enough to force a person to enter cultivation deviation and collapse.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou’s will did not collapse. He had a body constitution that wouldn’t suffer from cultivation deviation.</p><p>His thoughts were still clear.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou understood that he was still in the world of void general Hong’s obsession. He was still in this body, and now, it was the scene of the battle!</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>His voice was extremely weak, and it rolled out from his throat.</p><p>His eyes were filled with blurry and sticky blood. Xu Xiaoshou tried his best to look up.</p><p>He couldn’t see the enemy, but he could see a giant surrounded by endless devilish energy.</p><p>It laughed.</p><p>It personally stabbed Xu Xiaoshou’s chest with the two-handed sword that belonged to void general Hong.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his head, and the great pain and unwillingness turned into a roar. He stared at the sky with his eyes wide open, and there was only one last will left in his mind.</p><p>“Ran Ming… I’m sorry…”</p><p>“I can only… Go first…”</p><p>…</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The space began to crack.</p><p>On the long street in the night, just as Xu Xiaoshou walked to the void general’s portrait he had sketched…</p><p>Mei Siren, Xiao Kongtong, and Ghost Granny did not even see any movement from the void general in the portrait. Perhaps they did, but Xu Xiaoshou did not have the time to draw it and present it.</p><p>The next second.</p><p>“Boom, boom, boom!”</p><p>The world formed by Xiao Kongtong’s Fantasy Sword Technique collapsed with a loud bang. The painting scroll of the long street was also destroyed by an inexplicable and terrifying force. It shattered in an instant and turned into spiritual energy that drifted in all directions.</p><p>“Splat!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou spat out a mouthful of blood as if he had suffered a heavy blow. He was sent flying, and even the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale fell from his hand.</p><p>“AI, he’s simply messing around!”</p><p>Mei Siren cursed in a low voice. He immediately judged that Xu Xiaoshou was not dead, but his spirit and soul had suffered a heavy blow. His entire body had collapsed, his eyes were unfocused, and his six spirits were not there. It would take at least three to six months for him to recover.</p><p>In the next second, his figure flashed and he flew out.</p><p>When he reappeared, Mei Siren had replaced where Xu Xiaoshou was standing.</p><p>His left hand grabbed death-courting King Xu Xiaoshou, who was sent flying backward, and he protected him behind his back. The stone sword in his right hand was raised high, and his cold eyes were full of coldness.</p><p>“A dead spirit, why are you causing trouble?”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, he stepped on the Yama, and thousands of sword images worshipping it hovered above its head, rising up like a giant waking up, reaching the sky.</p><p>“D*mn…” Ghost Granny, who originally wanted to take this opportunity to escape, felt that something was wrong with the power behind her and suddenly turned her head.</p><p>In the next moment, the monster-like sword image had left a deep impression in the depths of her heart before it even attacked, causing her to almost curse.</p><p>“What the hell is this?!</p><p>“Is this something that the kind-looking old Sword Deity will cultivate?</p><p>“A Demi-saint’s Power is only so-so!”</p><p>Ghost Granny’s lips were dry and her legs were soft.</p><p>She didn’t even dare to run anymore. She was afraid that if she moved, the sword image’s gaze would take her life.</p><p>Ghost Granny could not see the sword image behind Mei Siren.</p><p>However, Ghost Granny knew the power that was unique to the Dao of the soul and was known as the Phantom Swords Technique by ancient swordsmen.</p><p>This was definitely above her!</p><p>Run?</p><p>Even if she could run a hundred or a thousand miles, she would still be within the normal attack range of the Azure Mo Swords in the sword image’s hand!</p><p>Did she want to run? Would she dare?</p><p>She wouldn’t even know how she died!</p><p>“Swordless Sword Technique, the second realm…”</p><p>After Mei Siren showed his sword image, he had no intention of holding back.</p><p>He knew how terrifying the spirit of the void general, which even he could not see, was. It could destroy Xu Xiaoshou’s soul and mind in one blow. Thus, he used his trump card. It was the second sword that he had planned to leave for Jiang Buyi!</p><p>“So what if you can’t see?</p><p>“So what if you are strong?</p><p>“Even if you are not afraid of death and want to charge forward to continue attacking, even if you are frightened by the sword image, you will turn around and run away.</p><p>“My sword will wipe out all living beings, undead, and other existences within a radius of ten thousand miles. You can’t attack, and you can’t run. You can only continue to sleep in the void!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
