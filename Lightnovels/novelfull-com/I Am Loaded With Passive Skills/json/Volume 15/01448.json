He was actually quite talented… he had a talent for meditation.</p><p>On the old mottled street, Xiao Kongtong circled around Xu Xiaoshou, who sat cross-legged in meditation. He rubbed his chin as if he was looking at a precious species, and said seriously.</p><p>“It is indeed rare to see Xu Xiaoshou in such a calm state!”</p><p>In the past, every time he saw him, he was either stirring up trouble or about to stir up trouble. When had he ever sat quietly like this?</p><p>It was only at this time that one could see Xu Xiaoshou’s talent in cultivation.</p><p>It had only been 15 minutes, but this kid had already completed a state of meditation without being distracted and an aura emanated from his body.</p><p>There was hope for the Present Gods and Buddhas!</p><p>Xiao Kongtong had guided tens of thousands of swordsmen who wanted to become Ancient Swordsmen in Fringe Moon Immortal City.</p><p>There were many who entered the state of meditation as quickly as Xu Xiaoshou, and there were even those who were faster than him.</p><p>However, after entering a meditative state, it was rare to find one who could reveal the aura of their inner visualization, find his own original intention, and display it outside the Spiritual World in just a quarter of an hour!</p><p>With such talent, even if it wasn’t as exaggerated as what Master Siren had said, he would be able to form the Present Gods and Buddhas in an instant. As long as he could sense the feeling, he could make a step by step progress and master the Heart Sword Technique. It was only a matter of time.</p><p>Well, the duration of the test varied, it all depended on one’s realization quality!</p><p>Some people were able to cultivate to the first realm within three months or a year after they found the feeling.</p><p>However, some people had spent decades and only at the end of their lives were they able to to find this feeling and cultivate the Present Gods and Buddhas.</p><p>“I wonder how long Xu Xiaoshou will take?” Xiao Kongtong thought to himself curiously.</p><p>He remembered that his Teacher’s record was around an hour, while his own record was twelve hours.</p><p>However, there was no point to do a comparison. After all, both he and his teacher had only begun to train in the Heart Sword Technique, after they had almost mastered all of their other sword techniques.</p><p>With the accumulation of his past knowledge and aura, it was very easy to find the ‘intent’ in a short time and manifest it.</p><p>Of course, this ‘easy’ was the result of Xiao Kongtong’s comparison of his own sect to Mei Siren’s sect.</p><p>If one were to compare Xiao Kongtong to those people in the Fringe Moon Immortal City…</p><p>Everyone in the school cultivated the Heart Sword Technique only when they had achieved the other kinds of swordsmanship. Even the most talented genius he taught before took nearly half a year to master it.</p><p>They were beyond comparison!</p><p>But even so, he was still a genius!</p><p>Xiu Yuanke…Xiao Kongtong recalled this name. He could be said to be very powerful. Other than himself and his teacher, he was a rare genius among the Ancient Swordsman.</p><p>“Master Siren, how long did it take you to comprehend something when you practiced the Heart Sword Technique?” When he thought about it, Xiao Kongtong could not help being curious and asked.</p><p>He didn’t directly say that he had cultivated the Present Gods and Buddhas because Master Siren’s school was different from his. As long as he could find the feeling and understand the Form, it would be considered a success.</p><p>After that, he would continue to polish his skills of his Way of the Sword through the improvement of his cultivation level.</p><p>“Seven days.”</p><p>Mei Siren answered nonchalantly. He did not feel that this question was too abrupt. He was very happy to answer questions from a Junior. Perhaps this was how he perceived a good teacher should be.</p><p>“Seven days? You should’ve learned the Heart Sword Technique from the very beginning. To be able to grasp the basic form of the Heart Sword Technique in just seven days… You’re simply too powerful.” Xiao Kongtong sighed sincerely.</p><p>If he had learned the Heart Sword Technique from the very beginning as a child, he probably wouldn’t have been able to make any progress even after seven years.</p><p>Mei Siren laughed when he heard this, and his gaze shifted from Xu Xiaoshou. He held his paper fan and looked at Xiao Kongtong and said, “What I’ve cultivated in seven days isn’t the embryonic form of the Heart Sword Technique, but the chaos form of the Present Gods and Buddhas.”</p><p>“Eh?” Xiao Kongtong’s face stiffened. This was too terrifying!</p><p>“How old were you back then?” He couldn’t help but ask as he wanted to make a comparison.</p><p>“Around 12 or 13 years old?” Mei Siren tried to recall, but could not remember clearly.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong remained silent for a moment, and after a long time, he asked, “Was that your first time to hold a sword?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Mei Siren’s words made Xiao Kongtong feel slightly comforted.</p><p>After a short pause, he heard the elderly Sword Deity continue, “That was three days after I first held my sword.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was speechless.</p><p>Three days?</p><p>What was the difference between this and the first time he held a sword?</p><p>Mei Siren dealt a small blow to the young man’s mentality as he smiled and said.</p><p>“I happened to be quite talented in the Heart Sword Technique. The other techniques were very difficult to master, and I spent several decades on them.”</p><p>“Not to mention that when I was your age, I didn’t have much combat strength. If you really want to compare me to a peerless monster like your master, I can’t even be mentioned in the same breath.”</p><p>“Three breaths for Innate Stage, three years for Sword Deity…” . He was such a peerless monster that even You Tu can’t be compared to him.</p><p>That was true!</p><p>Xiao Kongtong agreed wholeheartedly with this point.</p><p>In fact, according to conventional theory, one would have the qualifications to become a Sword Deity if they had mastered the first stage of one of the Nine Major Sword Techniques.</p><p>As long as that person rose and had the most basic Cutting Path Stage combat strength to fight against the higher void level, he could take the place of one of the Seven Sword Deity.</p><p>However, the battle for the title of Seven Sword Deity had become increasingly intense since the last Swordsman’s cultivation era.</p><p>Later on, the latter became the first realm that had mastered a certain sword technique, and he was not even qualified to issue a challenge to the Seven Sword Deity of the previous generation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
