The two remaining balls of dark will-o-wisps in his eyes were focused on Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>In that instant, the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale’s heart beat faster. Xu Xiaoshou felt his mind shake as an unknown power invaded.</p><p>As if he had pulled out the image he could see when he used the Expertise Passive Skill, his vision first went black, and then his entire person seemed to have left his body and entered another world.</p><p>“What’s this?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. He hadn’t even chosen a passive skill yet. Was it just because the void general had taken a look and brought him into its consciousness?</p><p>Was it synchrony?</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have understood something.</p><p>The reason the void general could still exist in the form of a spirit soul must be because his obsession before his death was too strong.</p><p>And using the Ghost Inscription to scan the spirits of all living things was to automatically open the door to the spirit world, handing over one’s half-spirit soul form to all living things.</p><p>In terms of the soul, there was only a thin veil between Xu Xiaoshou and the spirits of all living things.</p><p>This layer of the veil was almost non-existent in front of the void general, who had been very powerful in the past.</p><p>Therefore, the void general could bring Xu Xiaoshou into the world of his obsession with one look.</p><p>“Very good, then let me see what kind of obsession you have.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t resist this kind of synchrony.</p><p>First of all, he was also an extraordinary soul body, and his consciousness was not in chaos. As long as he wanted to, he could leave at any time. Since there was a way out, he could explore this world without any worries.</p><p>Secondly, Xu Xiaoshou was very interested in the void general.</p><p>At this time, whether the other party was intentional or not, this synchrony and the special experience similar to Soul Reading was the best opportunity for Xu Xiaoshou to understand the void general’s past.</p><p>Even if the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale’s heart beat faster, he wouldn’t die. Xu Xiaoshou also didn’t believe that the two bodyguards behind him didn’t have any guarantee of his safety.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou removed the last layer of passive mental defense and completely let go of his thoughts. He merged with the world of obsession brought by the void general’s glance.</p><p>“Boom, boom, boom!”</p><p>With this fusion, the world in front of him immediately changed.</p><p>The long street was still the same long street, and the giant kingdom was still the giant kingdom. However, the world here no longer had the ancient and mottled taste.</p><p>The dust had not accumulated, and the moss had not grown.</p><p>In the world of the void general’s obsession, the giant kingdom was at its peak.</p><p>On the long street, there were a large number of giant warriors who looked like void attendants. They were wearing black battle helmets that almost merged with their skin.</p><p>They either strode across the sky or split off from the two sides of the long street. They were in a rush, like soldiers rushing to the battlefield.</p><p>The void general…</p><p>Or rather…</p><p>“Me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lowered his head and saw that he was wearing brand-new blood-red armor. The ground was very far away from his pupils, about ten feet. This was not something that a normal human body could feel!</p><p>I, became it?</p><p>Am I the void general now?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clenched his fist and felt that his body was full of power. There was no other spiritual source or Sword Will, it was pure physical strength.</p><p>He was now a giant!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>He didn’t think too much about it. The ground on the street beside him trembled, and a giant of a similar height to him floated down. He was also wearing new armor, but the armor was green.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could tell from the aura that this person was not simple. He was at least a void general!</p><p>“Hong…”</p><p>The void general in green armor spoke in a language unique to the void attendants that Xu Xiaoshou had come into contact with before.</p><p>“Yoo… Died in battle…”</p><p>“The front line… Needs you.”</p><p>“Let’s fight… Side by side… Or… Fight to… The end…”</p><p>Intermittent voices could be heard.</p><p>This wasn’t a special way of speaking for the Giant Clan. It was just a fragment of void general Hong’s soul memory that was sent over. At this moment, it was a series of fragmented images.</p><p>However, even though these images were fragmented, Xu Xiaoshou could not help but feel a sense of grief.</p><p>Combined with what Master Siren had said earlier, there was no doubt that “Yoo” was another void general, and “Hong” was the one he had substituted. And the one in front of him was in green armor.</p><p>“Fei…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t even ready, and a deep, hoarse voice came out of his mouth, “I’m… Always… Ready!”</p><p>Fei!</p><p>So, the third void general was called Fei?</p><p>Turning his head, Xu Xiaoshou looked back at void general Hong.</p><p>On the long street behind them, there were tens of thousands of giant soldiers who were about ten feet tall, which was not tall for giants.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
