(Part 1)</p><p>“Is this the result of Xu Xiaoshou’s short 45 minutes of practice of the Heart Sword Technique?”</p><p>Under the silver moon, another silver moon suddenly overlapped and rose up, heavily stimulating Xiao Kongtong’s senses, making his scalp numb.</p><p>As an ancient swordsman who had also practiced the Heart Sword Technique like Master Siren, he had already intervened at the moment when Xu Xiaoshou’s spiritual body had been pulled into Elder Xie’s spiritual world using the Heart Sword Technique.</p><p>It was for no other reason than to keep an eye on Xu Xiaoshou at all times to prevent any accidents.</p><p>Who would have thought that the attack launched by Elder Xie using the aura of the power of the evil god a moment ago would make people think that Xu Xiaoshou was absolutely helpless in his current state and needed help?</p><p>In the next second, before he could make a move, Xu Xiaoshou had already launched such terrifying spiritual imagery!</p><p>“Sword God, Gu Louying?” Xiao Kongtong’s Adam’s apple rolled, and he swallowed his saliva. He felt that he was the one who was affected by the Fantasy Sword Technique, so he turned his head to look at Master Siren.</p><p>Mei Siren didn’t explain and said calmly, “Continue watching.”</p><p>He had no intention of helping at all.</p><p>Did Master Siren think that Xu Xiaoshou could resist the aura of the power of the evil god that even Xiao Kongtong was afraid of?</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Xiao Kongtong’s mind.</p><p>At the same time, he once again seriously observed the image of the endless strange black-purple sea in Elder Xie’s spiritual world being polluted into pure black and surrounded by devilish energy after the imagery of the sword body Gu Louying was manifested and Xu Xiaoshou’s Present Gods and Buddhas under his eyes was unfolded.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou cultivates the Heart Sword Technique, but perhaps it would be more appropriate to call it the Devil Sword Technique.”</p><p>The words that Master Siren had once said once again echoed in his mind. He smiled and felt that his understanding of Xu Xiaoshou had deepened.</p><p>Perhaps, he could really pollute the presence of the power of the evil god, something that even he himself could not do?</p><p>…</p><p>In the spiritual world.</p><p>The moment Elder Xie, who had the Cursed Yin Eye between his brows, saw the sword tower rising up from the waves in front of him, he felt a terrifying pressure and impact sweeping towards him, almost forcing him to prostrate himself in his spiritual world.</p><p>“I’m the master of this spiritual world!”</p><p>Elder Xie’s obsession was roaring and shouting madly. He didn’t believe in heresy at all.</p><p>However, when he raised his eyes again, he accidentally caught a glimpse of the black figure at the top of the sword tower. When the figure slightly tilted his head and opened his eyes, their eyes met.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>All the madness and chaos in his mind were like a compressed energy mass. He could no longer hold it in and exploded.</p><p>Endless devilish energy burst out from Elder Xie’s body. His spiritual body, which was already in a mess due to the evil god’s aura, was turned into a monster by the devilish energy on the spot.</p><p>In his blurry vision, the back of the figure on the sword tower was not the only one.</p><p>It overlapped countless images!</p><p>Some of them were the things that Elder Xie had feared the most along his journey. These were the terrifying inner demons that he did not want to face directly.</p><p>There were also terrifying monsters that he had never seen before. They were golden Buddhas that could suppress one’s thoughts and will, ferocious colossuses that stepped on the Yama and had thousands of swords on their heads.</p><p>There were also some figures with high-level auras that would never cross paths with him in the past or in the future. They were demi-saints, or perhaps even Holy Emperors.</p><p>In the end, the black figure turned into a winged black demon Berserk Giant as his spiritual body watched.</p><p>It was as if it had just woken up from the primordial chaos. It had not moved at all, but Elder Xie could hear the footsteps.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>An invisible foot stomped heavily on his spiritual world. In an instant, the illusory and distorted black-purple sea shattered and collapsed.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>On the long street, dark red blood spread out from the sea that was emitting devilish energy and had been contaminated from black purple to pure black.</p><p>Then, the black fluid that was filled with an evil aura quickly gathered back into the strange main body. It was the Cursed Yin Eye that Elder Xie had transformed into.</p><p>The next second.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The huge eyeball, which was originally emitting a black-purple aura, had now turned into pure devilish energy. It exploded into pieces, as if someone had died from cultivation deviation.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s spiritual will returned to his body on the long street. His eyes lit up with spiritual light, and the first expression on his face was astonishment.</p><p>“It’s over?</p><p>“It’s suppressed so easily?</p><p>“That’s a strange combination of the power of the ancestral source, and it’s a crazy and possessed a strange combined body that entered cultivation deviation.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t believe it, but he understood after thinking about it.</p><p>First of all, Master Siren had said that Elder Xie didn’t control the true power of the ancestral source, but only borrowed a little bit of the power of the evil god’s aura. The aura was very frightening, but it wasn’t truly invincible.</p><p>At the very least, it was not like Teng Shanhai’s tangible power of Demon God, which was so powerful that even Jiang Buyi feared it.</p><p>After borrowing the aura, Elder Xie’s spiritual body had completely fallen into madness, and he was only left with a lingering obsession with Xu Xiaoshou’s name.</p><p>He couldn’t be like him, who could maintain his rationality in madness and perfectly control the power of cultivation deviation.</p><p>If he were to be slightly affected, Elder Xie’s mind would collapse from the Heart Sword Technique’s suppression.</p><p>Finally, the image of Present Gods and Buddhas visualized by the Heart Sword Technique was so powerful that even Master Siren, an ancient swordsman who also practiced the Heart Sword Technique, could influence it.</p><p>Putting aside the fact that Elder Xie’s spiritual body was already in a state of cultivation deviation, even if he still had his rationality, he was not proficient in the Dao of spirit and soul. He was not even comparable to Yi, so how could he last long under such imagery?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
