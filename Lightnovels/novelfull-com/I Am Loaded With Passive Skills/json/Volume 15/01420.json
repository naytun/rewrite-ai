The next second, his hands, which were about to reach into its arms, suddenly stopped and became very steady.</p><p>There were more?</p><p>His facial features contorted, and his tears almost spilled out.</p><p>He held back his tears, which were filled with emotions, and did not withdraw the hand that was holding the void crystals. He only trembled and held them in front of him. He bent his body and his tears flickered.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>“Keep them well.” The void attendant released its grip and held its old friend’s shoulder.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought in silence, “Of course, I’ll keep them well. I mean, do you have any more? Please give me more.”. Xu Xiaoshou still hadn’t taken back his hand. He still held it in front of his chest.</p><p>“Brother, I…”</p><p>“This is what you deserve, and it’s also my thanks!” The void attendant interrupted again with a solemn expression.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waited for a while and finally realized that the void attendant didn’t seem to be able to take out any more crystals.</p><p>He realized that these void crystals could not be counted in hundreds or thousands. Perhaps 60 was the highest price.</p><p>In the eyes of the void attendant, this was even a price that could repay the favor of saving his life!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was well-versed in the art of “quit while you’re ahead”. With a flip of his hand, he squeezed the void crystals into his Yuan Mansion. After which, he clenched his fist and hammered it against his chest.</p><p>“Brother, I have just woken up, and I really need this sum. I won’t decline your offer, but I will always remember your kindness in my heart. ”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>The void attendant nodded heavily and took a step back. It extended its fist with a serious expression.</p><p>“Good friends.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment. He took half a step back and sincerely extended his fist, gently touching the void attendant’s fist.</p><p>“For a lifetime!”</p><p>Bam!</p><p>The two fists collided, and the air currents surged.</p><p>The force of the wind was insignificant to the huge void attendants, but to humans, it was a strong wind that could even lift up waves. As for the scene… it was even more confusing!</p><p>The three humans were stunned.</p><p>Even though the wind blew and some dust got into their eyes, the three of them still widened their eyes and looked in front of them in disbelief.</p><p>The daytime glow of the Abyss Island poured down on the two dark void attendants on the chaotic battlefield in the Forest of Miracles. Their fists exchange was like an eternal friendship that even heaven and earth were witnessing.</p><p>This scene was almost omnidirectional, rotating from big to small without any blind spots, and was finally deeply imprinted in the minds of the three people.</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong could not help but open his mouth first.</p><p>If both of them were actual void attendants, he would have found the pretentious scene in front of him understandable.</p><p>The problem was that they all knew that one of the giants was Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>How did this guy manage to blend in so perfectly and carry on the scene so harmoniously?</p><p>Were they really becoming sworn brothers?</p><p>No, was the other one a male or female?</p><p>If it was a female, would the two of them kneel down together in the next second and bow to each other as husband and wife?</p><p>Everyone had been a third wheel before. All Sword Deities and the higher voids would have encountered similar situations. It was human nature. Xiao Kongtong had also witnessed public displays of affection from his teacher and mistress. The image was very sweet to think about it…</p><p>Now, however…</p><p>He was going crazy!</p><p>Or had the world gone crazy?</p><p>The situation had suddenly transformed into a very new one!</p><p>The three of them turned their eyes at the same time and looked at each other. Their words seemed to be stuck in thick phlegm, rolling in their throats, but they could not say a word.</p><p>However, even though there was no sound, everyone knew how shocked they were at this moment.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, got together with a void attendant?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
