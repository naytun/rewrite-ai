I didn’t expect that there would be someone with such a cultivation base among the Seven Sword Deities. I always thought that besides having the qualification to become a Saint, the rest were just people like Gou Wuyue and Rao Yaoyao who can’t even compare to the Eighth Sword Deity.”</p><p>“But, you!” Jiang Buyi’s eyes were fixed as he looked at Mei Siren and he did not hide his admiration, “I have a whole new level of respect for you.”</p><p>“You’re too kind,” Mei Siren was not surprised and did not feel happy at all. He even had the spare energy to speculate whether Jiang Buyi was trying to do something behind their backs by talking so much nonsense.</p><p>Although he didn’t know the real age of the other party, it was very likely that Jiang Buyi was younger than him!</p><p>No matter how powerful he was, even if he was a demi-saint, would a word of praise from someone from the younger generation make the older generation happy? The reverse would probably be better!</p><p>Mei Siren almost blurted out, “You’re not bad either. At least you’ve proved to me that the legend of Bazhun’an is true and that not all demi-saints are invincible.”</p><p>But he thought about it and didn’t say it.</p><p>Otherwise, the second battle between demi-saints would definitely start because of a verbal dispute!</p><p>Seeing that the three fellows in front of him did not have the intention to continue chatting with him and were, on the contrary, maintaining a high level of vigilance, Jiang Buyi was asking for a snub.</p><p>He was just trying to make friends, so why were they so nervous?</p><p>“I actually have one last thing to say…” Jiang Buyi smiled.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong laughed as well, not hiding his impatience at all. He picked his ear with his little finger and flicked it, sneering, “I don’t really want to listen anymore.”</p><p>“I’m not talking to you, I’m talking to Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>As soon as he said this, the three people focused their eyes at the same time and their auras changed. They were like tigers gathering their strength, ready to pounce at any time.</p><p>“Don’t be so nervous…” Jiang Buyi waved his hand to show that he meant no harm, “It’s just a few words of praise. I said I would give you face, so I will!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong and Ye Xiaotian were both silent.</p><p>Mei Siren closed the folding fan in his hand and threw it into his ring. Then, he casually brandished the stone sword on his back.</p><p>At the critical moment, using the Swordless Sword Technique was far less efficient than having a weapon in hand, because the latter would save him one step.</p><p>Jiang Buyi took in all of their reactions. He shook his head and laughed. He no longer looked at these people and turned to look at the void.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I know you’re still here. Don’t worry, since these people are protecting you, I won’t make a move on you again today. Hmm… Strictly speaking, I wouldn’t have made a move on you in the first place. I said I would give you two choices before, but it was just a joke. After all, the world is not just black and white. There will always be a third path to choose. What I said just now was to see how you would deal with it with your intelligence,” He paused for a moment, but there was no response.</p><p>Jiang Buyi knew that the kid was also on alert, probably more alert than anyone else at the scene. He raised his eyebrows and spread his hands, “It’s a pity that Master Siren entered the arena too early. I couldn’t get a satisfactory answer because you chose one of the options that I gave, which makes you different from the rumors. In my impression, you are someone who can even trick Rao Yaoyao. That’s one of the Seven Sword Deities… Oh, right, Mei Siren is also a Seven Sword Deities. perhaps Master Siren’s entrance was also within your calculations?”</p><p>“I understand… This is your third path?” Jiang Buyi’s eyes suddenly widened as if he was frightened by his own speculation. He looked at Mei Siren people in surprise.</p><p>“Ha,” Mei Siren smiled lightly.</p><p>Was he using such a low-level scheme to drive a wedge between them? It seemed that he had thought too highly of the other party just now. He put the stone sword back on his back, thought for a moment, then brought it back into his hand.</p><p>Jiang Buyi still did not receive a reply from Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He couldn’t possibly reuse the holy realm and shrink it again in front of everyone just to lock onto Xu Xiaoshou’s location and pick him up for a good chat.</p><p>That was too stupid!</p><p>After all, the two-and-a-half cultivators would definitely make a move!</p><p>Therefore, Jiang Buyi shrugged and sighed helplessly, “It seems like I’ve been despised by everyone. This is a first.”</p><p>“Alright, I’ll leave. Since even I’m so unpopular…” He shook his head like an old man who was no longer liked by the young people. He could only start to clean up the battlefield and choose to leave.</p><p>Xiao Divine Spear, Soul-losing Saint Tower, Divine Demon Piece, as well as the remaining nine great soul weapons that he had yet to fully use… Under the watchful gazes of the three people, Jiang Buyi slowly packed up all his things and smiled at them.</p><p>“Goodbye, everyone. If we’re fated to meet again, I hope that we’re neither friends nor enemies, and we’ll all be well.”</p><p>With that, the wind and clouds gathered, and the Sun returned.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s body disintegrated with a “pop”, turning into a golden light and flowing away with the wind.</p><p>One breath…</p><p>Two breaths…</p><p>Three breaths…</p><p>After waiting for the time of ten breaths, the three seemed to have let down their final guard and heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>“Let’s go,” Ye Xiaotian’s perception of space was extremely sharp. He knew that there Jiang Buyi was no longer in this space.</p><p>“Hu~” Xiao Kongtong did not say anything. He only let out a long breath, dispelling all the uneasiness in his heart.</p><p>“Yes,” Mei Siren nodded slightly, confirming Zhou Shen’s words. He placed the stone sword back on his back and walked over to the two people in front of the Demon God’s great spear.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
