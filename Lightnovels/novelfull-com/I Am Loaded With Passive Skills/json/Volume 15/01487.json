Ghost Granny saw the giant’s head that she had just stepped on, as well as its eyeballs.</p><p>As they looked further, everyone’s eyes became serious, because that position was where the “special one” Xu Xiaoshou had mentioned was located.</p><p>The painting scroll stopped there. It took a lot of time to finally draw a lifelike outline of a giant that was ten feet tall.</p><p>It was wearing a huge blood-red armor with complicated and ancient patterns carved on it, as well as all kinds of marks left by swords and sabers.</p><p>This giant was not standing. It was half-kneeling on the long street. It wore a blood-red helmet on its head and was looking up at the sky, as if it would rather die than submit. However, in its eye sockets, there were only two balls of gloomy will-o-wisps.</p><p>There was a huge two-handed sword stuck in its chest. The sword was almost as tall as it was. It was ancient and mottled, but it was one of the few weapons that were not broken. However, the sword body was full of holes and wounds from the battle.</p><p>The painting ended and disappeared at the other end of the long street.</p><p>Everyone was shocked by the giant general who was half-kneeling with his head held high and a heavy sword pierced through his chest. Even though it was just a painting, Xu Xiaoshou had perfectly restored its intent.</p><p>“The aura of a demi-saint!”</p><p>Mei Siren’s eyes narrowed slightly. He could not believe that such a horrifying and bloody scene was hidden in the background of the few people present.</p><p>This was Xu Xiaoshou’s own imagination.</p><p>In such a short period of time, his imagination had grown to such an extent that he could even sketch out such a magnificent painting of the long street.</p><p>“It’s real?” Xiao Kongtong couldn’t believe it. This was his fantasy realm!</p><p>“It really exists.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded with absolute certainty. This was what he had seen, and it couldn’t be wrong. According to Xiao Kongtong’s reaction, it couldn’t be an illusion.</p><p>The three people in the arena were all speechless.</p><p>After a long time, Xiao Kongtong finally couldn’t help but let out a curse, “Xu Xiaoshou, are you crazy? There are so many corpses here. Aren’t you worried when you see them?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s shoulders drooped, and he couldn’t help but hold his head with his hands. His voice also rose a lot. “I thought you all saw them. If you’re not worried, why should I be?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was speechless.</p><p>What he said made sense.</p><p>At this moment, he couldn’t help but think of the ideas he had when he obtained the semi-saint person and Demon God’s great spear in the Sleeping Valley.</p><p>It was said that the battle between the Giant Clan and the Demon God had taken place on Abyss Island.</p><p>Now, it seemed that these might not be legends.</p><p>“What is it?” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t look at the remains of the giants. He only pointed at the giant spiritual physique in the blood-red armor and asked.</p><p>No one gave an answer. Even Xiao Kongtong only knew a little about these secrets.</p><p>Ghost Granny was even more terrified. She was already afraid of the existence of the giant’s remains. She felt that something that she couldn’t touch at her current level must have happened here a long time ago.</p><p>In her eyes, Xu Xiaoshou’s painting of the long street was almost as shocking as what she had experienced in Blood World.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Mei Siren seemed to have thought of something and slowly said, “Void general!”</p><p>“What’s a void general?” Xu Xiaoshou asked curiously. At the same time, he suddenly saw the void general in the distance move.</p><p>F*ck!</p><p>That wasn’t an illusion, right?</p><p>Did… Did it move? Was it still alive?</p><p>Startled, Passive Points, +1.</p><p>However, what Xu Xiaoshou saw was not what the other three could see.</p><p>“It’s said that there were only three void generals,” Mei Siren continued. “In ancient times, they were the generals who led the Giant Clan on Abyss Island. After that battle, the remaining giants became the void attendants of today.</p><p>An existence stronger than the void attendant?</p><p>Xiao Kongtong and Ghost Granny were dumbfounded.</p><p>In their eyes, the void attendant was not a force to be trifled with.</p><p>Perhaps it was easy for a demi-saint to fight, but anyone below the demi-saint level could do nothing to those huge monsters that could even devour Holy Power.</p><p>Was Xu Xiaoshou’s void general even stronger than this?</p><p>“Gulp!”</p><p>Before the others could ask about the details of the battle, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but swallow his saliva and said, “It, it moved!”</p><p>The other three people’s hair stood on end, like cats that were provoked.</p><p>“Draw it out!” Mei Siren was on guard.</p><p>Although he didn’t know where Xu Xiaoshou learned this painting skill, at this moment, it was the best connection between what he could see and what he couldn’t see.</p><p>Everyone looked over anxiously at the same time. Then, they saw Xu Xiaoshou, who was controlling his masterpiece, the void general, tremble slightly.</p><p>“Thump thump, thump thump, thump thump!”</p><p>At this moment, the heartbeats in the arena were so loud that they could almost hear each other.</p><p>However, after waiting for a long time, with Xiao Kongtong’s anxious eyes, Xu Xiaoshou still didn’t make any further moves.</p><p>“Draw!” He urged.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shrank his neck and pointed in front of him weakly. “I wanted to draw it too, but it only moved for a moment, and I already drew it out.”</p><p>Cursed, Passive Points +3.</p><p>It had to be said that in this creepy atmosphere, Xu Xiaoshou was simply the best blending agent. Anyway, the fear of Xiao Kongtong had been diluted by a lot, and he just wanted to tie this kid up and beat him up first.</p><p>“Let’s leave this place first.” Mei Siren couldn’t be bothered to teach Xu Xiaoshou a lesson anymore. He had thought of something.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
