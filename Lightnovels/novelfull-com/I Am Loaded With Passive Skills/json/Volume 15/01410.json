One thing was certain – Xu Xiaoshou could not be resurrected!</p><p>As such, there was not much power left to put up a resistance against his sword.</p><p>Mei Siren knew exactly what Jiang Buyi’s thoughts were – the other party did not even want to bring back this will incarnation. After he killed Xu Xiaoshou, the will incarnation’s mission would be complete and it would dissipate on its own.</p><p>However, at this moment…</p><p>Mei Siren understood this clearly, but he still could not stifle the killing intent in his heart.</p><p>“This! This old man’s student hasn’t even been initiated yet!”</p><p>“How could a Demi-Saint stoop so low as to kill a junior?”</p><p>“Utterly shameless!”</p><p>“Shatter…”</p><p>The green Mo Sword formed beneath the stone sword.</p><p>Mei Siren did not use much power, not even the Eighteen Sword Forms, because it was not worth the effort if it was only an incarnation of the Demi-Saint’s will.</p><p>However, when the Mo Sword together with the stone sword stabbed into Jiang Buyi’s will incarnation, which had turned around and had a calm smile, Mei Siren could no longer hold back his impulse.</p><p>“Green River Sword Boardline!”</p><p>“Shatter, death by a thousand cuts!”</p><p>“Die!!!”</p><p>With a boom, the Sword Will erupted and countless Mo Swords were formed in the Nine Heavens. They shuttled wildly through Jiang Buyi’s will incarnation and cut him into pieces.</p><p>However, Jiang Buyi’s face did not twitch at all when he disappeared and he still had a smile plastered on his face.</p><p>“That was painful.”</p><p>He laughed softly and looked down at the will incarnation which had shattered into crystal dots. However, before it finally dissipated, it looked directly at Mei Siren.</p><p>‘You’re using such extreme power against a Demi-Saint’s will incarnation that has no power to resist.”</p><p>“It’s too painful! It was really too painful! My true body is connected and can already feel the pain from your sword that hacked me into pieces.”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>Jiang Buyi still had a smile on his face. His will incarnation had finally shattered, but he left behind these last words in the Nine Heavens.</p><p>“This Saint wanted to experience this kind of pain!”</p><p>“Because I can imagine that the pain in your heart right now is a hundred times worse than this!”</p><p>These few words reverberated in the void.</p><p>“Mei Siren, you’ve lost!”</p><p>…</p><p>“You’ve lost…”</p><p>“Lost…”</p><p>“Already…”</p><p>An endless echo reverberated in his mind.</p><p>That despicable face had clearly disappeared, but it was still reflected in his eyes.</p><p>“Oh.” Mei Siren’s heart lurched. He groaned and blood seeped out from the corners of his lips.</p><p>This was not only due to the backlash he had suppressed for a long time after he used the sword earlier, but also because he had been provoked by Jiang Buyi and his qi and blood were affected.</p><p>Yes, Mei Siren knew that he had lost.</p><p>Even if he had killed one of Jiang Buyi’s Demi-Saint incarnation, the target he was supposed to protect had not survived. Jiang Buyi had succeeded in the end and he had lost forever.</p><p>Mei Siren had never had such a crazy impulse to kill someone instantly.</p><p>He had cultivated his heart and mind for a long time. He should not be so violent, but at this time, the viciousness in his heart was roused. It was like the hot blood that existed only during his younger days, that surged and attacked people’s souls continuously.</p><p>Silence hung in the air.</p><p>For a long time, Mei Siren’s body remained immobile as if he had been petrified.</p><p>The world was enlarged in his eyes.</p><p>Everything that his gaze fell on slowed down.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s attack missed its target. Even though his Spatial Upanishad was at the world’s fastest speed, he was still half a step too slow due to Jiang Buyi’s sudden attack and the damage caused by the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree.</p><p>It was as if ‘space’ was Ye Xiaotian’s destiny.</p><p>Even if he pounced forward with all his might, at the last moment, what he held in his arms was only the illusion of Xu Xiaoshou that had been eliminated by the Holy Light.</p><p>There was only air left.</p><p>There was nothing left.</p><p>All that was left was space, and the loneliness would accompany him forever.</p><p>The little white-haired boy remained in this position with his arms crossed. He was frozen in mid-air, and images of Elder Sang and Xu Xiaoshou flashed through his mind.</p><p>The roast goose and the wine drinking in the thatched house… the collapse of Tianxuan Gate, how he built a spatial passageway channel for his disciple. cleaned up his mess.</p><p>During the night battle at the Spirit Palace, his arm was cut off and the Spirit Library Division burned down, but he still had to lie for his disciple and chase after the non-existent sneak attacker.</p><p>In the Eighth Palace, they saw Elder Sang being hit by a magic arrow… Xu Xiaoshou exposed the four sets of Treasure of Suppressing Barrier he had stolen, in front of them. He even bent down and shamelessly used his foot to retrieve his ring.</p><p>The memories were scattered.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian had no idea what was going on.</p><p>All he knew was that he had failed to fulfil Elder Sang’s last request. Xu Xiaoshu was gone.</p><p>“I failed to do anything…”</p><p>The white-haired boy closed his eyes in the air, and the pain in his heart turned into two lines of tears, which flowed down his cheeks.</p><p>…</p><p>Behind him, Xiao Kongtong still struggled on the ground.</p><p>He had been badly affected by the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree, and he could not move at all. He watched Xu Xiaoshou die, but he couldn’t even make a move to help.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was dumbfounded.</p><p>They had agreed on the ‘Ten Auras’, but in the end, he had held on for another Ten Auras more than Ye Xiaotian in front of the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree. in the end, when it was time to save the person, he could not even contribute the tiniest bit of strength.</p><p>‘What have I done?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong felt his soul leave his body, and his eyes were filled with confusion.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
