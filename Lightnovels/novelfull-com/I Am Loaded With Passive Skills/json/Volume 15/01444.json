There was a shock in his eyes as he said, “As expected, what Master Siren has is the most complete, comprehensive, and perfect Present Gods and Buddhas, including the Nine Major Sword Techniques!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked sideways.</p><p>Only the real cultivators could see through the essence of the Way of Sword.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s words vividly and thoroughly interpreted Master Siren’s powerful sword image.</p><p>When he looked back at the sword image monster again, he found traces of the Nine Major Sword Techniques. He was even more stunned.</p><p>How many years of cultivation did it require to achieve such perfection?</p><p>“Focus.”</p><p>The smile on Mei Siren’s face suddenly disappeared as if he was facing two naughty students in class. As his expression turned serious, his aura changed drastically.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his body sink, and two holes appeared on the ground.</p><p>“Received pressure. Passive Points,+1.”</p><p>“Attacked. Passive Points,+1.”</p><p>“Intimidated. Passive Points,+1.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The messages popped up on Information Bar. Xu Xiaoshou felt the terrifying pressure from the sword image, which Present Gods and Buddhas and Penetrating Divine Senses formed!</p><p>“Substantial spiritual pressure, impact, and even damage…”</p><p>At this moment, the charge point of the Disillusionment Finger was rapidly increasing, and the Passive Points were also steadily rising with the strange changes in Information Bar.</p><p>Beads of sweat had already seeped out of Xu Xiaoshou’s forehead, and he felt stuck in the mud, unable to move.</p><p>The last time he saw this sword image, he watched the battle from the side. Today, after experiencing Master Siren’s sullenness, he felt even more intimidated and frightened.</p><p>He could not move at all! He was completely suppressed! If his past enemies had this ability, he would’ve probably died long ago!</p><p>“Are all of these not real?” Thinking of Master Siren’s words, Xu Xiaoshou spoke with difficulty.</p><p>“It can be real and not.” Mei Sien’s expression did not change, and he did not withdraw his aura at all. It was as if he wanted to ruthlessly give Xu Xiaoshou a wave of head-on impact, leaving a strong impression. After this, they could talk about the rest later.</p><p>“I don’t want to repeat, but…”</p><p>“The eyes are the windows to the body. The heart is the residence of the will. The Heart Sword Technique is the visualization of the cultivator’s self, releasing the real ancient swordsman have found in us.”</p><p>“As long as you can master this realm, it’s unreal to those who can’t see because they can’t feel anything unusual when they walk past. But for those we want them to see, this kind of release of self is real! It’s the most direct attack!”</p><p>As soon as Mei Siren finished speaking, he held the stone sword in his right hand and gently drew it in front of his eyes.</p><p>He did not stir up any dust or waves.</p><p>But then, the sword image also moved behind him. Azure Mo Swords in his hands, representing Mo Sword Technique and Swordless Sword Technique, crossed in the sky and made a cross slash.</p><p>The simple and unnoticeable cross slash…</p><p>Just like that, in front of Xu Xiaoshou’s immobile body, the swords rapidly enlarged in his pupils!</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s hair stood on end. He felt as if he had been struck by lightning. He could feel death approaching, but he was so numb that he could not move.</p><p>“Wait, isn’t this teaching time? Why are you attacking me?”</p><p>“Master Siren, wait!”</p><p>“Oh no!”</p><p>There was no buffer time!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened his mouth to say something, but he couldn’t make a sound. He could only watch the cross-sword light from Azure Mo Swords pierce through his body.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>A shrill cry rang out, and Xiao Kongtong was so frightened that he quickly closed his eyes and dodged to the side.</p><p>After calming himself down, he quickly turned to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>This guy was standing straight on the spot, but his spiritual body had materialized and was sent flying into the sky. His eyes had lost focus, and he seemed to be dead.</p><p>“What the…”</p><p>He was confused.</p><p>At a certain moment, Xiao Kongtong even thought that Master Siren had been possessed and was about to attack Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>His impression of Master Siren didn’t seem to be such a hot-tempered person. Even if he was teaching the sword, shouldn’t he have been a patient and gentle teacher?</p><p>He had always been gentleman, right?</p><p>“Is it because Xu Xiao was distracted and looked at me?” Xiao Kongtong trembled, a hint of fear appearing on his face.</p><p>…</p><p>“I’m dead?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, whose spiritual body had been forcefully cut out, felt a familiar feeling.</p><p>He had transformed into Perception as if he was God, and he could see that his physical body had stopped in place, frozen and unmoving. He could see Xiao Kongtong trembling in fear, standing there respectfully. He could also see clearly that Master Siren in front of him was not possessed but had just casually slashed out with his sword. It seemed like it was his problem that he could not block it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had experienced a similar feeling when fighting Rao Yaoyao’s Secular Sword, but the sensation at the moment was very different.</p><p>Secular Sword brought one into the world of mortals, causing one’s state of mind to age and decay. One would not be able to come out, and what would happen after escaping was beyond imagination.</p><p>The sword image’s attack hit the spiritual body and even helped Xu Xiaoshou find the source of his spiritual will.</p><p>However, the help was too sudden and terrifying.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>While he was still immersed in his thoughts, the intense pain from his spiritual body made Xu Xiaoshou scream again.</p><p>He lowered his head and saw that after the cross-shaped slash, his spiritual body had been divided into four pieces. The wind didn’t bring any comfort but stimulated the wound fiercely!</p><p>“Attacked. Passive Points,+1.”</p><p>“Master Siren seriously wants me to die…”</p><p>“I don’t want to learn the goddamn sword technique anymore…”</p><p>“Damn it. It seems like I’m going to die. My mind, thoughts, and…”</p><p>“Haha.”</p><p>Just as Xu Xiaoshou’s consciousness was about to sink into chaos, Mei Siren stood in front and laughed.</p><p>The sword image behind him also grinned. The next second, the Nine Swords flew out and formed a sword array in the sky.</p><p>At this moment, the dust and sand blown up were forcefully pushed back to the ground. The invisible sound waves came back from a distance, like dandelions calling back their bodies. Xu Xiaoshou’s immobile body also floated a little higher because the shattered bluestone floor under his feet had healed and returned to normal.</p><p>Time Reversal!</p><p>“That’s enough. Come back,”</p><p>Mei Siren put down the stone sword in his hand, and the hands of the sword image also dropped down. The cross-shaped slash flew back from the void, passed through the crack of Xu Xiaoshou’s spiritual body, and returned to Azure Mo Swords.</p><p>…</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly opened his eyes and gasped for breath, as if his soul had suddenly left his body and then returned. His whole body was soaked in a cold sweat.</p><p>“How was it?” Mei Siren looked at him with a smile and asked softly.</p><p>“What the..” Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyes in anger. He was about to attack, but when he looked over, he saw the monster sword image behind Master Siren and immediately shrank.</p><p>“Master Siren, I almost died just now!” Xu Xiaoshou waved his fist angrily with an upset face like a poor puppy.</p><p>“I’m asking, how do you feel?” Mei Siren was smiling as usual.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned and recalled the feeling just now.</p><p>It was the sensation of death!</p><p>He had seen the most extreme spiritual attack, felt the most real spiritual death, and also witnessed the most helpless despair after being controlled by absolute mental strength.</p><p>“This sword only released less than ten percent of the power.” When Mei Siren opened his mouth, Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded and astonished.</p><p>Less than ten percent…</p><p>“Is this the difference between Master Siren and me?” he thought.</p><p>He had already thought his gap with someone in the higher void level wasn’t that drastic.</p><p>Mei Siren seemed not to plan to defeat Xu Xiaoshou. After boldly killing him once, he reversed time and brought him back from the underworld. Then, with his demonic smile, he spoke again, “Next, it’s your turn to visualize.”</p><p>“Release the most extreme and purest version of you, follow your most honest call, visualize the image not limited to what you currently know, and materialize the intent!</p><p>“Use your heart to find the residence of will. Use your eyes to release your Gods and Buddhas that belong to you!”</p><p>After a pause, Mei Siren’s tone became more encouraging,</p><p>“Let’s give it a try. If you can successfully cultivate Present Gods and Buddhas, even if it’s only the initial stage, you will have a reward. It will not be just a toy.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
