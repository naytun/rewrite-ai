He wanted to see who had the time to use Watched to scare people. He also wanted to use Soul Reading on the enemy and plunder that power!</p><p>To repay resentment with honesty, and to repay kindness with kindness.</p><p>…</p><p>“It, it’s sinking in!”</p><p>Under the moonlight, Xiao Kongtong looked at Xu Xiaoshou in shock as he was engulfed by the strange black-purple fluid. He turned to look at Master Siren with worry.</p><p>In fact, Mei Siren’s eyes were also slightly nervous. However, when he thought of Xu Xiaoshou’s repeated awakening from cultivation deviation when he practiced the Heart Sword Technique, he couldn’t help but feel nervous.</p><p>In the end, he didn’t make a move to save him. Instead, he smiled and said, ” “Don’t worry, Xu Xiaoshou has a body constitution that won’t suffer from cultivation deviation. He’s very special.”</p><p>“He won’t suffer from cultivation deviation?” Xiao Kongtong was stunned. “What kind of physique is this? What is the principle behind this?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou actually had such a secret?</p><p>His curiosity was piqued, and he wanted to ask.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Mei Siren immediately looked at him with a slightly threatening look and said softly, ” “Everyone has their own secrets. As seniors, we should respect the younger generation. Curiosity will kill the cat. Little Xiao, don’t you think so?”</p><p>“Uh,” Xiao Kongtong’s face froze.</p><p>“Master Siren, I didn’t know that you were more protective of your child than me. Didn’t Xu Xiaoshou just call you Teacher?</p><p>“Besides, I’m just curious. I can’t force Xu Xiaoshou to tell me the secret of this body.</p><p>“What’s my relationship with him?</p><p>“I am his Eldest Senior Brother!</p><p>“Our teacher is Bazhun’an!</p><p>“You, Mei Siren, are only a latecomer!”</p><p>Countless thoughts flashed through Xiao Kongtong’s mind. Finally, he opened his mouth and said nervously, “Master Siren, don’t worry. Other people will hurt Xu Xiaoshou, but I will never.”</p><p>The Mei Siren laughed and waved his paper fan, “That’s not what I meant. Of course I trust you. I’m just saying that Xu Xiaoshou’s secret might bring you danger, so it’s best not to ask too much.”</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s eyelids twitched as he stared at the words “are you stupid?” on the fan. He fell into deep thought.</p><p>…</p><p>It was dark, cold, and evil.</p><p>All sorts of strange feelings invaded his spiritual world.</p><p>And Xu Xiaoshou, who relied on his body constitution that won’t suffer from cultivation deviation, swam unscrupulously in this vast sea.</p><p>The strange, sticky fluid was cut into pieces by the Close-bounds Force Field. It splashed out and then came back, hitting his body again and again.</p><p>This feeling was very uncomfortable, but Xu Xiaoshou gritted his teeth and held on.</p><p>“It’s been almost an hour…”</p><p>He calculated the time precisely and was about to maximize his Disillusionment Finger charge points to the maximum.</p><p>However, after an hour, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he could not hold on any longer.</p><p>Traveling in this evil fluid for a long time consumed a lot of his mental energy. He was very tired now, and he felt drowsy.</p><p>He felt that cultivation deviation was not scary, but if he fell asleep in this ocean, then even a Spirit Awakening would not be able to save him.</p><p>“I can’t be greedy. I have enough.”</p><p>Disillusionment Finger (charge point: 48.2%)</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even dare to think about achieving 50% Disillusionment Finger charge points in the past.</p><p>He felt that in this situation, one Yi might not be enough for him to kill. This finger might be able to threaten a demi-saint now.</p><p>“It’s time to reel in the net!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had gained something after traveling through the endless ocean for an hour.</p><p>Not long after his body had completely sunk into the sea, he found something similar to the strange main body. However, it looked a little scary, and Xu Xiaoshou didn’t want to face it.</p><p>However, after searching for so long, there was nothing under the sea that looked like the strange main body other than that thing.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stopped and used his Perception to explore the front.</p><p>“Woo…”</p><p>A cold and piercing mental energy sound wave came from the front.</p><p>What he saw with his Perception was a head-sized purplish-black eyeball. There was a wound on the side of the eyeball, which was extremely horrifying.</p><p>What was even more strange was that the eyeball was wrapped in a piece of human skin, and there was even hair growing behind the human skin. The lower part of the eyeball was connected to a headless body with human limbs.</p><p>“He was originally a man.</p><p>“But he was forced by Xiao Kongtong to use such a demonic technique. The eyeball then occupied his head, and he turned into this ghostly appearance?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had goosebumps all over his body. He had never seen such a terrifying thing.</p><p>However, he had to face what he had to face. He clutched the Fourth Sword in his hand. Xu Xiaoshou wanted to go forward, but he felt the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale throb.</p><p>“It’s a little dangerous, but not much.</p><p>“Perhaps, it’s still within the limits of what I can bear.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou only felt that this was absurd. This power and danger were comparable to when he had met the Saint. What was wrong with the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale? Was it only a warning of danger? It should be beating like crazy!</p><p>Was it broken?</p><p>Or was it…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lowered his eyes to look at the Fourth Sword in his hand. He felt that the sword was sharp, and it was more in line with his Sword Will than before. He seemed to have found another answer.</p><p>“Woo…”</p><p>The mental energy sound wave came again. Xu Xiaoshou no longer hesitated. He raised the Fourth Sword and stabbed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
