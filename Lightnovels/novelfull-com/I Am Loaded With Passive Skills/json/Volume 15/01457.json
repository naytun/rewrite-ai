(Part 3)</p><p>What kind of imagery did he dare to say that he would surpass the people of Mei Siren and the Bazhun’an?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stood high above the dark world with his sword in hand. He already had an answer in his mind.</p><p>“Come out…”</p><p>He continued to visualize.</p><p>In the endless black chaos, the winds and clouds suddenly changed and the entire spiritual world seemed to be on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Just as the unknown terror was about to arrive, a bright moon rose up from the chaos, followed by an ancient building.</p><p>The building was black and inlaid with black beads. It was grand, ancient, and majestic. There were a total of ninety-nine floors. Layer by layer, it pushed the aura to the highest point and pierced into the moonlight.</p><p>It was taller than chaos, higher than the world, and even suppressed Xu Xiaoshou, who was the master of the spiritual world!</p><p>There was no reason.</p><p>It was all because at the top of the Black Tower, there was an extremely blurry figure that couldn’t be seen under the moonlight.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The moment this blurry figure appeared, everything in the chaos began to shatter. It was as if it couldn’t bear the pressure of this image, and it was in chaos and collapse.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quietly looked at the back of the figure that he could not visualize.</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>This was the true Godhood in the hearts of all swordsmen in the world!</p><p>The Sword God, Gu Louying!</p><p>No one knew what he looked like or how he looked like.</p><p>Even the name “Gu Louying” was derived from the imagery of the Sword God because no one knew his real name – a Sword God who started the Way of the Sword and stood on the ancient building, leaving only his back!</p><p>However…</p><p>“Godhood?”</p><p>In the collapsing chaotic order, Xu Xiaoshou looked at the proud back of the man standing on the tall building. An evil thought flashed in his eyes and he sneered.</p><p>In his spiritual world, there was no god other than himself!</p><p>At this moment, even though he could only visualize vague imagery of the Sword God Gu Louying, Xu Xiaoshou’s body and mind were on the verge of breaking under terrifying pressure.</p><p>He once again let go of the evil thoughts in his heart!</p><p>Therefore, just like before he devoured and became the ancient giant, Xu Xiaoshou had the most treacherous thought.</p><p>He could replace him!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>As soon as he thought of this, his spiritual world exploded.</p><p>The chaos seemed to have been split apart by the will of the gods. Heaven and earth were suddenly born and then shattered. Yin and yang rotated and then were destroyed. Only the ancient building and the back of the figure remained unmoved.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s smile widened.</p><p>He, who was holding the black sword, seemed to have gone mad at this moment. It was as if his will had been completely devoured by the cultivation deviation. His mouth was full of heavenly words, and he was rebellious.</p><p>“This building should only exist in the heavens, and only I can handle it.”</p><p>Swish!</p><p>When this voice came from the Nine Heavens, Xu Xiaoshou disappeared.</p><p>He didn’t care about the consequences at all. He had completely erased all traces in this spiritual world that belonged to him.</p><p>However, in the next second, in the chaotic world, a name suddenly appeared on the ancient building with a total of 99 floors.</p><p>The words ‘First Pavilion in the Sky’ had been inscribed by the Sword Will on the plaque that belonged to it.</p><p>At the top of the ancient building, the figure that couldn’t be formed no matter how hard he tried to visualize also suddenly solidified.</p><p>The black sword robe that was full of evil energy flapped under the cold moonlight. The figure that couldn’t be seen suddenly had a head of long black hair that fluttered in disorder in this chaotic world.</p><p>“Boom, boom, boom!”</p><p>As soon as this figure appeared, everything was in chaos.</p><p>The collapsing chaotic world gave rise to all kinds of terrifying phenomena. There were lightning disasters, volcanic eruptions, mountain torrents, and tsunamis. It was like the end of the world!</p><p>However, it also seemed like the world was about to be reborn after the disaster!</p><p>The figure that stood unmoving on the top of the ancient building suddenly moved as if he had been standing there since ancient times and finally had a soul.</p><p>Under the moonlight, the figure on the top of the ancient building tilted his head slightly and opened his eyes coldly.</p><p>He took a glance.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The spiritual world constructed by the Heart Sword Technique was no longer able to hold on, and it was devoured by the boundless devilish energy before finally crumbling into nothingness.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
