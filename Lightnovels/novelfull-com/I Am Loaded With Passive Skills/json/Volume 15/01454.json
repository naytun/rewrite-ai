Since you’ve found me, why don’t you tell me your background? I don’t know you guys, but I’m more interested in the person behind you!”</p><p>After a pause, the gentle and refined man with squinty eyes seemed to have thought of something. After an “Oh,” he smiled and said,</p><p>“I’m sorry, I was rude first and forgot to introduce myself.”</p><p>“Of course, you should know me. Even if you don’t know me, you should have heard of my name. I’m Xiao Kongtong from Fringe Moon Immortal City!</p><p>…</p><p>“Sizzle! Swish!”</p><p>It was a school of chaos.</p><p>The moment the surging devilish energy burst forth from his body, his spiritual world, which was the direct manifestation of his will, was dyed pure black almost at the same time.</p><p>The Present Gods and Buddhas and sword image in front of him had disappeared, and they had all turned into terrifying monsters surrounded by devilish energy.</p><p>The ancient giant in the distance seemed to have become an indescribable evil god, giving people a direct spiritual impact and terrible pressure.</p><p>The turbulent devilish energy filled the sky, and Xu Xiaoshou felt that things were getting out of hand.</p><p>“Damn it, I was affected by the information bar!”</p><p>This was something he had never imagined.</p><p>Before he meditated, Xu Xiaoshou was sure that there would be no accidents during his cultivation.</p><p>Who was Xiao Kongtong? Who was Mei Siren?</p><p>With these two guardians by his side, how could he possibly make any mistakes while cultivating the Heart Sword Technique?</p><p>However, things were just so unpredictable that it was possible that the person who was watching him on Abyss Island at this moment had yet to make a move, and Xu Xiaoshou himself was like a bird startled by the mere twang of a bow. He was affected by the “watched” and went into cultivation deviation!</p><p>“Watched…”</p><p>It could be said that his current reaction was purely due to the terrifying pressure from being “watched” in the past.</p><p>It was either because he had seen Elder Sang’s ghostly face for the first time in Goose Lake, the latter forcefully feeding the Fire Seed, bringing a great sense of horror to people.</p><p>It was either Yu Lingdi in the White Cave that was clearly watching him, but he was forced to forget about it after knowing about it.</p><p>Or, there were all kinds of attention that he had yet to figure out, with no one knowing where they came from.</p><p>All in all, Xu Xiaoshou reacted sensitively to the word “watched”. It was like using the Breathing Technique and taking a large number of pills. Seeing a small and round object in a short time, he would have a certain stress reaction.</p><p>“I’m finished!”</p><p>“This ‘cultivation deviation’, how do I break it?”</p><p>The greatest fear of cultivation deviation was when Xu Xiaoshou was still in the Eighth Palace and when Elder Sang was shot by the Evil Sin Bow of Ai Cangsheng.</p><p>The old man who was usually omnipotent had become so powerless after that arrow!</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou realized that something was wrong with his current state, he almost lost his mind with a large amount of devilish energy in his spiritual world.</p><p>At this moment, he felt that the crazy evil intent had turned into a tangible demon in his spiritual world, baring its fangs and brandishing its claws as it charged wantonly, confusing his thoughts.</p><p>Each of these demons had its own name:</p><p>Elder Sang, Bazhun’an, Yu Lingdi, Night Guardian, Evil Sin Bow’s arrow, Demi-Saint Zang Ren, demi-saint Jiang Buyi… They were a dazzling countless array!</p><p>There were those that he had seen, not seen, and had never seen before.</p><p>Anyone who left a trace of fear in his soul and will was magnified at this moment, turning into a highly vicious devil.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>The demons roared, and it was as if the Nine Sereneties gates of hell had been opened. All order was gone, and only chaos was left in the world.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clutched his head in pain.</p><p>The only bit of consciousness he could keep seemed to be unable to hold on for much longer. He was about to be assimilated and turn into the will of the evil!</p><p>“No!</p><p>“I refuse to!</p><p>“Stop struggling!!!”</p><p>Drip.</p><p>The water droplets fell from the sky, and the crisp sound was so harsh in the endless chaos. Xu Xiaoshou widened his eyes, and he could no longer suppress the fear in his heart.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>After the beast roared, it was still well-behaved and not even clear. It only passed through the will of the self of the Present Gods and Buddhas and the self of the sword image and had the most substantial image.</p><p>It turned into the most violent two-winged giant that Xu Xiaoshou had transformed into when he faced the Double Dumba*s. He stood on an Ice Lotus and was surrounded by a white flames stream, like the most contradictory God of Ice and Fire.</p><p>However, in the next second, the God of Ice and Fire, who still had a trace of holy aura, was directly attacked by the devilish energy and turned into a winged black demon Berserk Giant.</p><p>This was the strongest Berserk Giant he had ever shown during the strange era. He had the Fourth Sword in his left hand and the Flame Python in his right hand. However, he had lost his mind and was now like a madman, killing the Present Gods and Buddhas and sword image in front of him one by one.</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>In the spiritual world, a painful roar reverberated in all directions.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he had been split into two wills.</p><p>One of the wills was trying to stop his crazy actions in fear. “No! It can’t be like this! I’m currently cultivating the Heart Sword Technique!”</p><p>However, another will sneered and retorted, “Isn’t this the Heart Sword Technique? How can my spiritual world contain the imagery of another person’s Heart Sword Technique? What’s the big deal about advancing these pieces of trash? if we don’t exterminate them all, how can we be called godless, faithless, and lawless?”</p><p>“You’re right… Godless, faithless, and lawless, it’s indeed equivalent to a state of cultivation deviation,”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that his kind will had been convinced. He muttered to himself and put his head into the mouth of the evil will.</p><p>“Eat me, turn me into nutrients. We are one.”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s vision turned black, and he sank into oblivion.</p><p>…</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, hang in there. You’ll definitely be able to walk out of this!”</p><p>On the long street, Mei Siren held his stone sword and stared at Xu Xiaoshou, who was tied up by the devilish energy and had already stood up in the air. His heart was in his throat.</p><p>From the pained expression on the little guy’s face, one could tell what he was going through in the spiritual world.</p><p>However, Mei Siren could not attack!</p><p>He could use the Heart Sword Technique to invade Xu Xiaoshou’s spiritual world and help him kill his inner demon.</p><p>But now, before he reached his limit, he could not use this technique!</p><p>“I haven’t opened my eyes yet…”</p><p>Although Xu Xiaoshou looked like he had finished his meditation and was completely in cultivation deviation, there was still a glimmer of hope in Mei Siren’s heart. Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were still closed!</p><p>Just as he had said, the Heart Sword Technique cultivated one’s will.</p><p>“The heart is the residence of the mind, and the eyes are the windows of the body.” As long as Xu Xiaoshou had not opened his eyes, no matter how wrong his state was, the devil in his heart had not been released.</p><p>There was still a chance!</p><p>“Maybe, Xu Xiaoshou can suppress the cultivation deviation and use it to cultivate a stronger Heart Sword Technique? In the past, there were no similar precedents.”</p><p>When Mei Siren thought about this, he suddenly stopped.</p><p>“Yeah, it’s true that there’s no one in the past who has been able to survive after experiencing cultivation deviation while practicing the Heart Sword Technique. But perhaps, Xu Xiaoshou, you’ll be the first person to do so?”</p><p>If it was an ordinary person, Mei Siren would have already intervened and helped to kill the inner demons.</p><p>However, geniuses and freaks were different!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou to Mei Siren was like Bazhun’an to You Tu. Mei Siren really regarded Xu Xiaoshou as a monstrous genius like Bazhun’an and trained him in that manner.</p><p>Therefore, even if he and all the students he had taught had never encountered a situation like Xu Xiaoshou’s, Mei Siren still felt that Xu Xiaoshou could solve it on his own.</p><p>As long as he hadn’t opened his eyes and released the devil in his heart, there was still room for turning things around.</p><p>Let’s take ten thousand steps back and talk about it.</p><p>The reason why Mei Siren had not attacked yet was that he could sense that every time Xu Xiaoshou was on the verge of losing control, he would undergo an awakening of his will.</p><p>It looked as if he had cultivated some sort of passive purification ability.</p><p>It was this kind of method that maintained a little bit of Xu Xiaoshou’s rationality. It also let Mei Siren see that Xu Xiaoshou was relying on himself to suppress the possibility of him entering cultivation deviation!</p><p>“Hang in there!”</p><p>If he could suppress his cultivation deviation, there was even a slight possibility that he could add this power to the Present Gods and Buddhas in front of him.</p><p>It was hard for Mei Siren to imagine how terrifying Xu Xiaoshou’s Heart Sword Technique would be. The Present Gods and Buddhas would be so bold and unconstrained that they could not be described with words!</p><p>Wasn’t this exactly what the Heart Sword Technique sought?</p><p>It was unknown. Could it push its limits?</p><p>“Tempered into steel…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, will you be the only one?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
