I’ll Wash, Wash, Wash (2)</p><p>Even Teng Shanhai was harder to fool than them!</p><p>With that, Xu Xiaoshou began to speak.</p><p>He had to squeeze out all the remaining value from this big cutie so that it could repay him for saving its life.</p><p>“Brother, you should be able to notice that there’s something special about me,” Xu Xiaoshou said in a heavy voice, but he didn’t point out what was special about him.</p><p>The void attendant nodded. It understood that this friend was about to tell it everything that had happened. It asked, “Why do you have the aura of the herb garden on you?”</p><p>“Sure enough, the Imitator couldn’t erase the aura either,” Xu Xiaoshou exclaimed in his heart, but he also felt that it was natural.</p><p>Imitators could change a person’s nature.</p><p>However, he had emptied the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, and external objects usually contaminate a person’s aura.</p><p>It was as if his body and genes had changed, but his clothes had not changed, so the smell he emitted remained the same. Therefore, the void attendant must have noticed his smell long ago.</p><p>It was just that the situation was critical earlier, and it was clear that its life was more important than the truth. That was why it didn’t dare to ask more questions, afraid he wouldn’t save it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou asked this question in a probing manner.</p><p>He didn’t expect that it would really latch onto it.</p><p>At this time, he immediately spoke the words he had prepared in his heart.</p><p>A “frank” explanation was always more convincing than an interrogation, let alone an “attendant”.</p><p>“My good brother, my condolences.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou patted the hand of the giant in front of him, covered his face, and sighed. “On my way to save you, I saw a human running out of this battle. I also sensed the aura of the herb garden you were guarding from him, so I stopped him.”</p><p>“Human!” The void attendant’s attention was indeed diverted, and it shouted angrily. If it was not mistaken, the thief that its companion had caught should be the one that it had been thinking about for a long time.</p><p>“He, where is he?” The void attendant was so angry that it wanted to appear in front of the man and kill him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head. He didn’t explain but changed the topic. “He used this aura to lure you and the human demi-saint here. Then, he let both of you fight so that he could take the opportunity to escape.”</p><p>“Human! Cunning! Detestable!” Realization dawned on the void attendant. it knew that something was wrong. It had followed the aura here, but in the end, it had been inexplicably beaten by a demi-saint.</p><p>“That was a human from the higher void level. I subdued him with one kick and gave him a good beating.” Xu Xiaoshou observed his opponent’s reaction and continued to polish his story, inadvertently adding details. For example, the higher void level and the fact that void attendants like to attack with their ‘feet’. These details made his story seem more realistic.</p><p>“Good!” The void attendant was overjoyed. “That human deserves to be taught a lesson!”</p><p>“You know, in the eyes of humans, we void attendants look almost the same.” Xu Xiaoshou continued, “After that human was beaten up by me, he obviously mistook me for you. He knelt down and begged for mercy, saying he would return all the spiritual herbs stolen from the herb garden.”</p><p>The void attendant’s eyes lit up like two light bulbs as big as the sun. “You agree?”</p><p>“A void attendant is a man of his word. Although I want to kill him, I choose to agree for the sake of your herb garden,” Xu Xiaoshou said righteously.</p><p>“What happened after that?” The void attendant was touched.</p><p>“He kept his promise and gave me all the spiritual herbs he had stolen from the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer,” Xu Xiaoshou said. Suddenly, he seemed to have been angered by something, and his expression became irritable.</p><p>“But!”</p><p>“He actually!”</p><p>“He only gave me this!”</p><p>He quickly dug out a Tier 1 spiritual herb from the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>After handing over the spiritual herb, Xu Xiaoshou crazily held his head and stomped his feet, causing a rumbling sound to echo in all directions.</p><p>“He only has this left!”</p><p>The void attendant was stunned.</p><p>Such a huge medicinal garden and this was all that was left?</p><p>“Where’s the Holy Medicine?” It asked resentfully.</p><p>“I asked him the same question!” Xu Xiaoshou was furious. “But he said that the deal between him and the human demi-saint was broken. The demi-saint took all the spiritual herbs from him. All of them! He only has this stalk of wild grass left!”</p><p>With a thump, the void attendant’s knees fell to the ground, and its mind went blank.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he might have exerted too much force and provoked the other side. He was a little scared, but he insisted, “I don’t understand! I’m furious! I feel that it’s not worth it for you, brother! In my anger, I broke my promise and stomped him to death!”</p><p>A dead person could not wake up to explain.</p><p>Not to mention that this so-called “dead man” only existed in the story itself and did not exist in the world.</p><p>The void attendant whimpered, his eyes were listless. Suddenly, he raised his head and roared.</p><p>“Good kill!” It stood up excitedly and grabbed Xu Xiaoshou’s shoulder, tears streaming down its face.</p><p>“After I killed the human who stole your spiritual medicine, I searched his body and ring as I didn’t believe him. However, I found that he wasn’t lying. He really only had this one spiritual medicine left. The rest was on the demi-saint!” Xu Xiaoshou cried sympathetically and pointed behind him with a trembling finger.</p><p>“It was that demi-saint just now. He is the real culprit…”</p><p>His name was Jiang Buyi!</p><p>He was the demi-saint of the Pu Xuan Jiang Clan in the Northern Region of the Shengshen Continent!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself quietly, “Remember this name, big cutie. Your Herb Garden of Divine Farmer was emptied by that hateful human. You must remember him. Don’t ever think about the smell of the spiritual medicine or that little human, Xu Xiaoshou, who may appear in front of you again.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
