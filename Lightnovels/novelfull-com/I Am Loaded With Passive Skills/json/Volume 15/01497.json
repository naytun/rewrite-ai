(Part 3)</p><p>This voice seemed to come from ancient times, hoarse and ancient.</p><p>However, the battle intent it contained was something that no one in the world could compare to!</p><p>As soon as the word fell, the fantasy realm outlined by Xiao Kongtong suddenly distorted and collapsed. The spirit that the four people could see on the long street also roared and was sent flying.</p><p>In the end, these countless spirits seemed to have been summoned. They rushed into the body of void general Hong’s spirit soul like moths to a flame.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>Ghost Granny’s soul was almost torn apart by this roar, and she looked at the figure in front of her in disbelief.</p><p>It was even more terrifying than what Xu Xiaoshou had drawn. Ten thousand times!</p><p>Its aura…</p><p>The aura of a demi-saint.</p><p>This spirit soul must have been a demi-saint when it was alive. Or perhaps more?</p><p>Even if it was dead, it could still use its spiritual power to mobilize such a strong Demi-saint’s Power in an instant.</p><p>“How do I fight this?!</p><p>“Who can tell me how I should fight this?!”</p><p>Ghost Granny went crazy. She wanted to look past the void general to see Xu Xiaoshou behind it, but she felt like there was an unattainable wall between her and Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>She had been completely locked on by void general Hong!</p><p>If she didn’t break this wall, not to mention looking at Xu Xiaoshou, even turning back to look at Mei Siren and asking him to come out and uphold justice would be a difficult problem that she couldn’t solve!</p><p>“It actually came.”</p><p>Behind her, Xu Xiaoshou looked at Hong’s back in disbelief.</p><p>He didn’t expect to succeed in summoning Hong on the first try, nor did he think that Hong would really follow his will and directly face Ghost Granny.</p><p>It should be known that before the contract was completed, the void general’s obsession was only the existence that looked like a Demon God. Even Master Siren’s sword could not stir up his thoughts at all!</p><p>“So, what I said, it actually listened, but it just didn’t give any more feedback?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was overjoyed. He had decided to use a little bit of the Red Ghost Inscriptions power to affect Hong’s will to fight Ghost Granny.</p><p>Who would have thought that there was no need at all?</p><p>When he shouted, Hong echoed him.</p><p>Could this battle start?</p><p>“Fight! Until the end!”</p><p>“Blood! To the last drop!”</p><p>Clenching his fists, Xu Xiaoshou shouted out these two words that seemed to be able to control the void general. He was nervous and expectant.</p><p>In the next second, he saw that on void general Hong’s chest, there was an obvious wound formed by countless spirits. It began to squirm and grow.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>As the blood-red armor clattered, void general Hong moved.</p><p>It slowly reached out, grabbed the two-handed sword that had pierced through its chest, and slowly pulled it out.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>As this happened, the Nine Heavens suddenly trembled.</p><p>The majestic Holy Power came from Hong’s spirit soul and the sword body. It was almost comparable to that of the demi-saint Jiang Buyi.</p><p>“This!”</p><p>Mei Siren and Xiao Kongtong turned their eyes with difficulty and looked at each other in shock.</p><p>Even they, who were far away from the battle, were affected. Then Ghost Granny…</p><p>He looked around and saw that the power of Ghost Granny’s soul, which had expanded and exploded, had been suppressed back into her body by an unknown force, leaving only her pale and frightened face exposed!</p><p>She could not even move.</p><p>She couldn’t even move her eyes because void general Hong was about to pull out his sword!</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Ghost Granny exploded. Her mind was completely blown.</p><p>How could it be so strong?</p><p>How could it be so powerful with just a simple act of drawing his sword? It pressed down on her until she couldn’t move at all!</p><p>Was this sword… its seal?</p><p>“No!</p><p>“Stop it!</p><p>“I definitely can’t let it be pulled out!”</p><p>Ghost Granny’s heart was screaming. She could already predict the consequences of pulling out the sword.</p><p>“I will die!”</p><p>However, what was even more despairing was…</p><p>“I can’t move!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
