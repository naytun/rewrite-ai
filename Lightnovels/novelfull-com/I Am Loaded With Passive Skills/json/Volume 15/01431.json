He’s a little special. Although he did offend Demi-Saint Jiang, his crime does not deserve the death sentence.”</p><p>“I think Demi-Saint Jiang had other reasons to kill him. It wasn’t just because I made use of him.” Xu Xiaoshou recalled the Power of Demon God that had erupted from Teng Shanhai’s body.</p><p>That kind of power was in the same league as the power of the God Devil Eyes that Lei Xi’er had! It was an enhanced version, but with lesser intelligence.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong pondered over this and then continued to ask, “Rao Yaoyao was there?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“She wanted to save Teng Shanhai, but Demi-Saint Jiang didn’t even respect her feelings?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded. This was exactly what he was puzzled about.</p><p>He already knew that Rao Yaoyao’s identity was not simple. Thus, he understood that Jiang Buyi had no reason to be so merciless and disrespectful.</p><p>“Although that guy was a Demi-Saint, wasn’t he afraid of death? Wasn’t he afraid of the repercussion from the Holy Divine Palace?”</p><p>There had to be another reason!</p><p>Mei Siren was also deep in thought. Suddenly, he hit his palm with his folding fan and said, “I think I know why.”</p><p>“Why?” Three faces stared curiously at him.</p><p>Mei Siren glanced at the three of them and hesitated for a moment before he spoke.</p><p>“When I performed the Space-Time Transition, I had a vague sense of a power that didn’t belong to Demi-Saint Jiang in the surrounding time and space. The level was even higher than his.”</p><p>“At that time, I had my suspicions. Now that I thought about it, that might have been the cause of Teng Shanhai’s death.”</p><p>Before everyone entered the Holy Realm, their senses were blocked, but Mei Siren had already thought of something.</p><p>“Did Teng Shanhai have a special power?” He looked at Xu Xiaoshou and asked.</p><p>“Special power?”</p><p>Before Xu Xiaoshou could reply, Ye Xiaotian, who had witnessed Teng Shanhai’s death, suddenly recalled something.</p><p>When he thought about what Master Siren said about ‘his level was even higher than Jiang Buyi’s strength’, he suddenly realized that he had been misled by the Holy Realm and underestimated the strength of Teng Shanhai’s power. His pupils shrank.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at Master Dean; he did not understand what was going on. He tried his best to explain with his limited knowledge. “He seemed to have a kind of demonic power?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s brows shot up. This demonic power was the same as the demonic power that he was aware of?</p><p>“To be more precise, it’s called the ‘Ancestral Source Power’,” Mei Siren said with a smile.</p><p>At that moment, Ye Xiaotian and Xiao Kongtong’s expressions changed. Only Xu Xiaoshou, who had a full view of their reaction, still had a look of confusion in his eyes.</p><p>“What was the ‘Ancestral Source Power’?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian and Xiao Kongtong also turned to look at him.</p><p>It was obvious that no matter how knowledgeable the people present were, they didn’t think that they knew more than this Master Siren who had lived for several generations.</p><p>His understanding would definitely be clearer and more comprehensive than their own.</p><p>Mei Siren was hesitant if he should tell the three people in front of him about all this, because once you gained some knowledge about some things, there was no going back.</p><p>But on second thought, even if they did not know, the three of them had also been sucked into the vortex.</p><p>And after being involved, the risk brought by ignorance was obviously even greater, so Mei Siren decided to tell them.</p><p>“The Ancestral Source Power is a power that only the Holy Emperor has the right to master. It’s also the foundation of a ceremony to summon and seal the Gods. It has multiple definitions. The most common ones are the Divine power and Demonic power that you were aware of.”</p><p>Holy Emperor… Godhood Sealing, Ancestral Source Power…</p><p>These terror inducing names shocked Xu Xiaoshou so much that his eyes widened subconsciously.</p><p>When he heard the words Divine Power and Demonic Power, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t care less about the reaction of the two people beside him.</p><p>The only thing that flashed through his mind was Lei Xi-er’s mysterious and extraordinary eyes.</p><p>“Let me get this straight.” He took a deep breath and asked, “Master Siren, you mean to say that the ‘Ancestral Source Power’ can exist in a form even if it is not the Holy Emperor and it can be mastered by a low-level Spiritual Cultivator?”</p><p>“Yes,” Mei Siren nodded. Just like the ‘Semi -Saint person’ and ‘Holy Emperor person’, the ‘Ancestral Source Power’ is also constant. There were only a few types. When the person who has mastered it dies, it will then be circulated among those in the same realm, or will be passed down to those between the higher and lower realms.”</p><p>For example, the God-Devil Eyes?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even dare to ask this question!</p><p>He already knew the answer, and finally realized the true reason for the tragedy that befell the Lei family. How could Lei Xi ‘er’s cultivation level realm improve at a faster rate than his?</p><p>Wherever such a force existed, there would be miracles and catastrophes!</p><p>“You mean to say that Demi-Saint Jiang was afraid, so it was even more necessary to eliminate the root of the problem. Since he had offended Teng Shanhai, he should kill him before he could fully grasp this power?” Xu Xiaoshou tried his best to calm down.</p><p>“You’re very smart.” Mei Siren smiled.</p><p>“Can he be killed?” Xu Xiaoshou was suddenly terrified. He had also offended Teng Shanhai. If this guy didn’t die in the end, what would happen?</p><p>“Why can’t he be killed? That’s a Demi-Saint!” Mei Siren laughed. “Even if a baby can lift a giant sword, he can’t defeat an adult. If there were no other adults present, even the giant sword would have been taken away.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou let out a sigh of relief, but in the next second, he became even more nervous.</p><p>Since Teng Shanhai had only revealed his strength, Jiang Buyi had no choice but to kill him.</p><p>If Lei Xi-er’s God Devil eyes were seen by covetous people… When he thought of this, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly froze.</p><p>On the Lone Cliff, in order to contain Rao Yaoyao, Lei Xi ‘er had already displayed the power of the God Devil Eyes blatantly in front of Rao Yaoyao!</p><p>“D*mn it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but slap himself.</p><p>“I’m finished!”</p><p>“It’s all over!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao knew!</p><p>With her identity and status, how could she not recognize the ‘Ancestral Source Power’? As long as she could get out of the Abyss Island, she could bring this information back to the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“There’s one last way out!”</p><p>A fierce look suddenly appeared in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes.</p><p>But in the next second, it faded.</p><p>“I can’t kill her…”</p><p>Although Rao Yaoyao was not very intelligent, there was no doubt about her combat strength. She was the leader of the Yunlun Mountain Range and he had to consider the big picture as well as her subordinates.</p><p>If she was forced to a dead end, she would set aside all her thoughts and use the Cang Godhood Sword. As one of the Seven Sword Deity, who in the entire Abyss Island was confident that they could kill her?</p><p>Master Siren?</p><p>If Master Siren had a trump card, did Rao Yaoyao not have any?</p><p>From the night battle in the Imperial City to the YunLun Mountain Range to the current Abyss Island, Xu Xiaoshou had only seen Rao Yaoyao use her sword once. That sword had almost ‘killed’ him.</p><p>And this was what Xu Xiaoshou thought was an insignificant sword compared to Master Siren and Bazhun’an’s swords.</p><p>But was that all Rao Yaoyao had?</p><p>Her sword was her total strength?</p><p>It was impossible! It might not even be one in ten thousand!</p><p>In Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes, Master Siren, who had never wielded his sword, was just a harmless old senior who had a little more experience. But who would have thought that there was an extremely fierce ‘Sword Image’ embedded in his heart?</p><p>If they had not seen it with their own eyes, who would believe that Master Siren had killed a Demi-Saint with one sword?</p><p>For an Ancient swordsman, either it was impossible for them to grow from the start, or after they grew up, they were all abnormal!</p><p>“Fate?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed heavily. He felt that the term ‘ill-fated’ was more appropriate to describe the complicated situation in his mind.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Ye Xiaotian was startled by Xu Xiaoshou’s sudden slap and asked with concern.</p><p>“Nothing, I was just thinking about some unhappy stuff.” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t explain. He paused for a moment, looked at the three people in front of him, then he solemnly bowed to thank them and took out something from the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>“Thanks for the three seniors’ help. I’m poor and don’t have much else. Just some Holy Medicine that I’ve just picked. Consider them as a thank you gift.” As he spoke, he pushed three Holy Miracle Fruits to them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
