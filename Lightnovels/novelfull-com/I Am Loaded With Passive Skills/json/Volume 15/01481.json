Her expression was full of disbelief, as if she had seen a ghost and she was not the actual ghost.</p><p>“+ Suspected, Passive Points +3.”</p><p>“It’s very simple…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s lips twitched and he looked at Master Siren with a smile, “I had some experience with All Things are Swords, so I can skip this step.”</p><p>All Things are Swords. He had already mastered it when he was still at the lowest level of the Sword Technique Expertise.</p><p>With the continuous improvement of this Expertise Passive Skill, Xu Xiaoshou had already reached the peak of perfection.</p><p>All this while along his journey, he had been tormented by all sorts of big bosses. After he gained his Perception, he had trained his mental resistance all the time. With the Disillusionment Finger, he had constantly triggered his Spirit Awakening to train his spiritual body and soul power. With this soul body, the ability to draw out so many ‘souls’ at the same time was simply something he could do without any difficulty.</p><p>Although Mei Siren had expected Xu Xiaoshou’s soul power to be very strong, he was still shocked by his move.</p><p>This was being too knowledgeable!</p><p>Your All Things are Swords realm is no longer below mine…</p><p>The power of your spiritual body and soul body are now based on the power of the Heart Sword Technique of the Present Gods and Buddhas and is probably not much weaker than mine.</p><p>Mei Siren remained stunned for a long while before he gently nodded and said calmly, “That’s not too bad.”</p><p>“Uh, only ‘not too bad’?” The corners of Xiao Kongtong’s mouth twitched as he listened. He thought to himself, “What Xu Xiaoshou displayed was already the level of his Phantom Swords Technique that he had practiced for many days. This was clearly ‘very good’ already!”</p><p>A genius!</p><p>An unquestionable genius!</p><p>Not only was he a genius in the Heart Sword Technique, but Xu Xiaoshou was also a genius in the Phantom Swords Technique!</p><p>At a certain moment, Xiao Kongtong even had the idea that he wanted to be Xu Xiaoshou’s Master. He did his best to cultivate this talent, but he quickly squashed this evil thought.</p><p>Oh my, this was a super plus generation!</p><p>“It’s impossible that Elder Sleeveless would allow it, and it’s also impossible for Teacher to allow it. As for Master Siren… he would definitely kill anyone!</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>“That’s impossible!”</p><p>Ghost Granny rubbed her eyes and looked again, only to find that the ‘ten thousand lights’ had not been fabricated by the Fantasy Sword Technique. It was real.</p><p>She glanced at Xu Xiaoshou silently, and her mind which had been stagnant all this while, began to stir.</p><p>“Without the ‘incantation’ that was necessary, without the spiritual technique for the ‘transfer of mentality method’, how could Xu Xiaoshou have mastered the Summoning Spirits technique so quickly?”</p><p>“Could it be that the meaning of the Great Path was hidden in Mei Siren’s instructions that I did not catch?”</p><p>Ghost Granny seriously recalled what Mei Siren had said and realized that the old Sword Deity had only said one simple sentence about the Summoning Spirits technique.</p><p>“By entering the path of All Things are Swords, one can deeply sense the ‘Spirit of all things’. All things have spirits, regardless of life and death. Those with different spiritual perception and soul bodies can easily do this. Those with poor talent will never be able to enter the door.”</p><p>She disassembled and pieced together what he said, word for word, in her attempt to find the deep meaning contained in it. She did the same for the second part of the sentence.</p><p>In the end, she still couldn’t find the answer she wanted. She even added the words ‘first step’ into the sentence.</p><p>“Don’t tell me that even movements are required?”</p><p>After she saw the results of Xu Xiaoshou’s training, Ghost Granny really didn’t want to miss this opportunity to secretly learn his skills.</p><p>She was confident that she was not weak in the Dao of the soul and had many years of cultivation experience. As long as she could grasp the meaning of Mei Siren’s words, she could also easily execute the Summoning Spirits like Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Therefore, when the three people in front of her were all focused on Xu Xiaoshou, she raised her hand and tried to understand the ‘incantation’ in her mind.</p><p>“Rise!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>A silent wind blew through the air.</p><p>Ghost Granny only saw a few blurry, large undead spirits. As for the sand, mist, and dust, she didn’t see any single bit at all!</p><p>“No way…”</p><p>Ghost Granny frowned and wondered if she had to say the ‘incantation’ out loud.</p><p>She did just that.</p><p>Once again, she silently recited the ‘profound’ words that Mei Siren had said and then she spoke as softly as possible in order to suppress her voice.</p><p>“Rise!”</p><p>With a swish, the three people in front of her stopped talking at the same time.</p><p>Under the night sky, three burning gazes turned, passed through the empty air in front of Ghost Granny and landed on the face of her soul body.</p><p>This…</p><p>Ghost Granny’s face blushed red instantly. She could even imagine the sizzling sounds that came from her burning face.</p><p>This sudden ‘Rise…’</p><p>It was too awkward!</p><p>There was a complicated look on Xu Xiaoshou’s face and his expression became distorted immediately.</p><p>Mei Siren’s cheeks also puffed up a little and a slight bulge could be seen, but he quickly restrained it.</p><p>But Xiao Kongtong couldn’t hold back his laughter.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>His mouth opened and he laughed heartily.</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>This endless mockery turned into an intangible pressure that invaded Ghost Granny’s soul body. She tried her best to suppress her shame and questioned herself, “Why can’t I do it?”</p><p>“Hahaha…” As soon as she said this, Xu Xiaoshou could not stand it any longer.</p><p>His maniacal laughter made Mei Siren, who almost could not hold back, tense up. He immediately suppressed all his emotions, and gave him a hard knock with his paper fan.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
