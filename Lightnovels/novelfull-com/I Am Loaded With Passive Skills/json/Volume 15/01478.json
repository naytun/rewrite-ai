All that was left was only rationality and the absolute desire to live.</p><p>“Thank you, thank you, Eldest Senior Brother…”</p><p>“As long as you let me go, I’ll do anything you want me to; I’ll be your slave!”</p><p>“What I can’t do, I will definitely use the connections and resources of the Three Incenses. As long as I am alive, no harm will befall you.”</p><p>“Shh.” Xiao Kongtong frowned, put his finger to his lips and shushed her.</p><p>Ghost Granny immediately realized that she had been too noisy. She pulled away and looked up at the Eldest Senior Brother of the Fringe Moon Immortal City in fear and trepidation as she awaited his orders.</p><p>“You’re thanking me too early.” Xiao Kongtong rubbed his ears and said calmly, “I only said I’ll give you a chance. I didn’t say I’ll let you live.”</p><p>Ghost Granny’s expression changed drastically and her eyes turned red. However, she quickly regained her senses and asked in a trembling voice. “W-what do you mean?”</p><p>“Your opponent is not me, but him. It’s up to you how you display your talents. As long as you can survive under his hands, I will not stop you from leaving. I will keep my word.” As he said this, he pointed to the side.</p><p>Ghost Granny’s soul body trembled as she turned her head with difficulty.</p><p>Under the night sky, two figures, one old and one young, stepped into the moonlight through the air.</p><p>The old man gently waved his paper fan and looked like a sage. The young one had a malevolent face and his head was worth a lot of money.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Ghost Granny’s eyes, which could swallow a person whole, trembled as she looked at Xu Xiaoshou. She didn’t think that he would be her opponent, so the only one left was the old man.</p><p>“Who are you?” Her soul body took a meaningless deep breath and tried to ask in a calm tone that a normal person would have.</p><p>“I am Mei Siren.” Mei Siren waved his paper fan and could feel that the question from the soul body was directed at him. He had always treated his opponents with respect and readily introduced himself at all times.</p><p>Mei Siren… Ghost Granny seemed to have heard this slightly familiar yet very strange name before. She lowered her head and chewed her lips for a long time. Suddenly, she raised her eyes and her soul body trembled.</p><p>“Seven Sword Deity, Mei Siren?”</p><p>At this moment, Ghost Granny’s shrill scream almost pierced the heavens, and her soul body began to crack.</p><p>Cracked…?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked as he looked at this scene. This was the first time he had witnessed a situation where a person’s soul could be scared out of his body at just the mere mention of a name.</p><p>Subconsciously, he stuffed his two index fingers into his ears. Then, in his mind, he saw that Ghost Granny’s shriek had added 0.01% of charge points to his Disillusionment Finger.</p><p>“If I take her down and let her shout 10,000 times at this decibel, I’ll have a 100% charge point for my Disillusionment Finger.” Xu Xiaoshou had this absurd idea in his mind.</p><p>“Yes, I am.” Mei Siren nodded calmly.</p><p>“You’re playing with me!” Ghost Granny’s eyes were bloodshot as she roared at Xiao Kongtong. She couldn’t even defeat the Eldest Senior Brother of the Fringe Moon Immortal City, so how could she defeat the Seven Sword Deity, Mei Siren?</p><p>This was an old monster among old monsters!</p><p>Wasn’t the only one who could compete with him, You Tu, who was also a Seven Sword Deity?</p><p>The benchmark for You Tu’s combat strength was his ability to kill the Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace in seconds.</p><p>“I must have been crazy!”</p><p>Ghost Granny held her head as she muttered to herself and almost broke down on the spot.</p><p>“How could I have even dared?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou had Xiao Kongtong and Mei Siren by his side. How could I have even dared to lay a finger on him? That was the shortcut to a quick reincarnation…”</p><p>That’s impossible…</p><p>“How could Xu Xiaoshou be protected by people like Xiao Kongtong and Mei Siren? Wasn’t he just a member of the Saint Servant? Why did these two giants from the Way of the Sword become his guardians?”</p><p>Mei Siren suddenly laughed.</p><p>He was a little amused as he did not expect this soul body to be so easily intimidated. With just a few words, her whole being was about to collapse. He immediately said, “I’m not your opponent. The one you’re going to fight with is him.”</p><p>He closed his fan and pointed at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Ghost Granny felt as if she had fallen from heaven to hell and then from hell to heaven again. Her mind was in a turmoil and she turned to look at the only young man at the scene in disbelief.</p><p>“You?”</p><p>It was just a simple word, but Xu Xiaoshou could hear shock, doubt, and contempt in it.</p><p>“Am I that incompetent? I have a few higher void levels under my command.” Xu Xiaoshou cleared his throat and said seriously, “You don’t know who ‘this deity’ is? I am Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>The ridiculous way he used the term ‘this deity’ immediately lightened the tense atmosphere of the scene and made it funny and slightly playful.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s eyelids twitched when he heard this. The paper fan that Mei Siren used to point at Xu Xiaoshou froze for a few seconds. He then brought it down sharply, but it was easily dodged by the ‘deity’ who had been well prepared for this.</p><p>Ghost Granny seemed to have heard the biggest joke in the world and subconsciously wanted to repeat her question.</p><p>However, she forcefully suppressed this impulse and turned to look at Xiao Kongtong and Mei Siren. She asked seriously, “You said that as long as I defeat him, I can live? Do you really mean that?!”</p><p>Her question was marked with an exclamation at the end. One could just imagine how much she cherished her life.</p><p>“I always keep my promises.” Xiao Kongtong nodded.</p><p>“A promise is worth a thousand pieces of gold.” Mei Siren smiled and said.</p><p>“After the first burst of energy, you will weaken, and by the third you will be exhausted!” Xu Xiaoshou stepped forward and pointed at the soul body in front of him. He sneered and said “You underestimate me, right? Do you believe that once you’re weak, I can kill you with just a single glance?”</p><p>“Hehe,” Ghost Granny laughed coldly in her heart. She didn’t even look at Xu Xiaoshou. She only stared at Mei Siren and asked, “How do we fight?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
