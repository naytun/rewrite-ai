He closed his paper fan and knocked Xu Xiaoshou’s head hard with it.</p><p>“Swish”</p><p>With the infusion of the Sword Will and Xu Xiaoshou’s body as the medium, the Sword Energy scattered in all directions on the long street and drew a perfect hexagram circle within a radius of 100 feet.</p><p>“Isn’t this your talent?” Mei Siren laughed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally realized that Master Siren was talking about his passive skill – ‘Sharpness’!</p><p>He was shocked.</p><p>He had so many passive skills so Master Siren’s paper fan didn’t set off any spiritual source fluctuations .Not only was he not knocked away, but he also released his own Sword Energy.</p><p>Or rather, the ‘Glow of Sharpness!’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that if he didn’t activate the Close-bounds Force Field, it would be hard for the ‘Glow of Sharpness’ to leave his body. How could Master Siren’s weak knock make it fall apart?</p><p>As if he had seen through Xu Xiaoshou’s confusion, Mei Siren put away his paper fan and said earnestly.</p><p>“In the 3000 Sword Styles, this is called ‘Transmission’. One of the principles of’ ‘Transmission’ is the root of the Sword Energy.</p><p>“When this path is cultivated to the extreme, coupled with the saber in the hands of the Swordsman, there is the so-called ‘Famed Sword Heavenly Unravel’, which can transmit all the power.”</p><p>He paused for a moment and Mei Siren’s eyes became serious, and he said solemnly, “The first sword skill I’ll teach you today is this ‘Transmission’. Remember it well!”</p><p>‘Transmission’…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that the ocean in his mind was also filled with stones and there were instant fluctuations.</p><p>Even without any further explanation from Master Siren, he was able to extract all of the knowledge that belonged to this ‘Transmission’ skill.</p><p>With the stone sword in his hand, he didn’t even need to swing it. With just a thought, a blast of Sword Energy that measured several feet in length shot out with the help of the ‘sharpness’ from the surface of his body. It looked dazzling and bright!</p><p>“?”</p><p>At this moment, Mei Siren was stunned.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong, who was beside him, was also stunned. He recalled what Xu Xiaoshou had said earlier. “My realization quality is very poor.”</p><p>Your realization quality is poor?</p><p>You have a poor realization quality and you found the connection between the stone sword and the Sword Body with just a touch of Master Siren’s finger, and then you mastered the path of ‘Transmission’?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, what kind of stunt are you trying to pull?</p><p>When I first grasped the ‘Transmission’, it took me two whole hours!</p><p>Xiao Kongtong nearly went crazy. He only felt that at this moment, these words were written all over Xu Xiaoshou’s face: ‘Beat me up’!</p><p>“+(Condemned, Passive Points +) +1.”</p><p>“+(Glared At, Passive Points, +)+1.”</p><p>“This is the ‘Transmission’ skill?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held the stone sword and turned his head in excitement.</p><p>It was this feeling, such a comfortable feeling of ‘ease’!</p><p>In the past, his mind was filled with knowledge, but he couldn’t use it in actual combat. Master Siren’s knock had opened up the channel that enabled him to be connected to the vast ocean through the water pipe.</p><p>Now, it flowed directly and was unstoppable!</p><p>Mei Siren had to restrain himself forcibly before he flipped open the paper fan that he used to chide Xu Xiaoshou for his stupidity. He had originally wanted to wait until Xu Xiaoshou’s sword had been blocked before he explained.</p><p>Who would have thought that this fellow had grasped it instantly and didn’t need to be taught at all!</p><p>I should maintain my demeanor and remain calm. I am a teacher now…Mei Siren had to constantly remind himself. He nodded gently and had a calm expression on his face.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>He snorted and added casually, “Not bad. I guess it’s okay, but there’s still room for improvement.”</p><p>Not bad?</p><p>Not bad is fine!</p><p>After he retracted his Sword Energy, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he was really going to take off this time.</p><p>“If the knowledge of the ‘Sword Technique Expertise’ could really be drawn out by Master Siren, then the first and second realm of the so-called Nine Major Sword Techniques and the Eighteen Sword Forms should not be far away, right?”</p><p>While he was in high spirits, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly realized that he seemed to have overlooked the most important point!</p><p>Master Siren had already started to teach the first sword skill, which was an official announcement that he would take him as a disciple. However, he hadn’t done anything yet. He hadn’t even acknowledged him as his master.</p><p>“Master Siren, how should I do it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was at a loss.</p><p>He did not know what the cultivation of the Ancient Swordsman was like, and what kind of apprenticeship ceremony was needed, so he could only follow the apprenticeship ceremony he had done with Elder Sang that day at the shores of Goose Lake and knelt.</p><p>At this moment, a pair of hands reached over and stopped him.</p><p>“There’s no need for that.”</p><p>Master Siren could totally tell what was in Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts. With such a pure heart, what more could a Master ask for?</p><p>He laughed and helped Xu Xiaoshou up. With a serious expression, he said softly, “I am the Teacher, and you’re the student. This is the ‘Transmission’, so why do you need to carry out the Teacher-acknowledgment ritual?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grabbed the stone sword and was touched by Master Siren’s friendly action.</p><p>This is the ‘Transmission’.</p><p>At this moment, he finally understood why the first sword that Master Siren taught him was this sword.</p><p>The 3,000 sword principles were to be taught as one.</p><p>The Way of Transmission, the Way of Imparting and the Way of Preaching!</p><p>However, just like how he had received the stone sword before, Master Siren’s teachings were ‘transmitted’ casually, but Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to be careless when he followed it.</p><p>He only paused for a moment. The image of the sword in the Forest of Miracles that made all living things worship it flashed in his mind. Xu Xiaoshou instantly understood what he should do at this time!</p><p>In the majestic ancient city, along the the long street…</p><p>Facing the Elder in front of him, Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath, took half a step back, bowed his head, and held the stone sword high above his head with both hands. His expression was solemn and with Xiao Kongtong as the witness, his clear voice rang out.</p><p>“This student acknowledges Master Siren.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
