After a casual glance, he met the will-o-wisp in void general Hong’s eyes and communicated with it alone.</p><p>After entering the Red Ghost Inscription, he had become the master of this spirit soul and could already conduct basic communication with it.</p><p>Even if void general Hong still had an obsession, its consciousness was still at the level of its most powerful opponent at that time.</p><p>“Everything in the past is just a fleeting cloud…”</p><p>On the hospital bed, Xu Xiaoshou opened his mouth lightly, like a charlatan making his opening remarks.</p><p>However, only he knew that what he said was true. He was speaking to his past self, and he was also turning his own experiences into the purest form of enlightenment for void general Hong to hear.</p><p>“We can’t let go of our obsession.</p><p>“But since we’re still alive and in this world, no matter what method we use… Whether it is to resurrect or become spirit souls…</p><p>“There are always some regrets that need to be made up for, and there are always some necessary things waiting to be completed. This is the meaning of our lives, isn’t it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou casually walked down from the bed, spread his hands, and sat in front of void general Hong, who was half-kneeling on the ground.</p><p>He knew that his words could be connected to the Red Ghost Inscription, and void general Hong, who had a deep obsession, could instantly understand him.</p><p>With just a thought, he could summon void general Hong to the real world and force it to start fighting.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou didn’t like to do that.</p><p>It was just like how he had obtained Greedy the Cat Spirit and the Ghost Beast Contract from Caramel. Until now, they had not officially signed the contract.</p><p>He didn’t like to make friends in a master-servant way. This way, they wouldn’t be considered friends at all, and their essence would be affected by some special rules.</p><p>In all fairness, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he was not compatible with the ghost beast, and the “friend” that he had established with Greedy the Cat Spirit was also very deep.</p><p>This…</p><p>After being together for so long, Greedy the Cat Spirit had changed from someone who knew nothing but eating to a good friend who was willing to test medicine for him and refine pills for him without considering the reward.</p><p>As for Xu Xiaoshou, for the sake of his good friend Greedy the Cat Spirit, he would risk his life and travel around just to find a field of medicinal herbs and fulfil Greedy the Cat Spirit’s dream of becoming an alchemy cat.</p><p>This was what a good friend was!</p><p>There was no need for a contract. Everyone would help each other and take what they needed.</p><p>Facing void general Hong, Xu Xiaoshou had used the Red Ghost Inscription first, but there was no other way. He had to first establish a bond and have the basic ability to communicate with the other party before he was qualified to be friends with Hong, right?</p><p>“What do you think? Do you think I’m right?”</p><p>After waiting for a long time, void general Hong didn’t comment on his profound words, so Xu Xiaoshou had to take the initiative to ask.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>With the heavy sword pierced through his chest, void general Hong, who was half-kneeling on the ground, roared in anger. His eyes were bright and shining, clearly agreeing with what he had said.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded in satisfaction and said,</p><p>“What about your dream? I already understand it. There’s no need to emphasize it.</p><p>“I brought you back to help you fulfill your dream. After all, I’ve always been a good person.</p><p>“You, this fellow, how should I put it? Sometimes, we don’t have to learn to let go, but we need to find a limit!”</p><p>“What limit? It’s the limit of knowing where to stop!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stood up and said in a dismissive tone,</p><p>“In your current state, even if you meet the enemy in your world of obsession again, I’m afraid you won’t be able to defeat him.</p><p>“So, my suggestion is not to aim too high and think about such a powerful enemy for the time being. Instead, we should face the current situation.”</p><p>Before he could finish, void general Hong suddenly opened its mouth and growled,</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. He quickly waved his hand and said,</p><p>“Don’t misunderstand. I’m not saying that you’re weak. I’m just saying that we have to take it step by step. It’s okay. I’ll help you. I’ll take you through battle after battle and train you to a higher realm.</p><p>“When the time comes, if you really have the chance to face your former enemies, you will no longer only have one companion in Fei. You will have me.</p><p>“I’ll help you. Let’s defeat him together. That guy…”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou spoke, he thought of the terrifying great demon he saw in the world of his obsession, who had killed void general Fei with a spear. Even the void general Hong had no power to resist it. His heart trembled, and his voice weakened a lot.</p><p>However, he roused his spirit and felt that even if he couldn’t beat them now, he would definitely be able to in the future.</p><p>In the past, the Giant Clan was isolated and helpless. Now they had his help… Even if they couldn’t defeat it, they could shake it!</p><p>If Bazhun’an were here, what great demon couldn’t be defeated?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
