He would have even added a little more and given it to the three in front of him.</p><p>However, he still felt that he was too stingy.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that the Holy Miracle Fruit was the most suitable Holy Medicine for the three of them who were under the Demi-Saint realm.</p><p>If he could help his own people to get to the higher void level and attain the Holy Power, at least it would be easier for him to fight against Demi-Saints in the future, right?</p><p>Moreover, if he were to encounter a situation where he needed help against a Demi-Saint again, Master Siren, Xiao Kongtong and Ye Xiaotian who had mastered the Holy Power would definitely be able to play a more useful role than now!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>However, when they saw this Holy Medicine, the three of them were stunned.</p><p>With their extraordinary knowledge, they immediately recognized what Xu Xiaoshou held in his hands and were naturally surprised and filled with suspicion.</p><p>“The Holy Miracle Fruit?”</p><p>Mei Siren was stunned for a few seconds before he raised his eyes and stared at Xu Xiaoshou. At the same time, he had a question in his heart, “Did you empty the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer?” that he did not ask aloud.</p><p>It was the same for Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>He thought of the ‘few large plants’ that Xu Xiaoshou had just mentioned. He felt that there could not possibly be so many Holy Miracle Fruits in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer. That was why the ‘few large plants’ that Xu Xiaoshou had picked were probably all Holy Miracle Fruits!</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s first reaction was one of shock, but his second reaction was to secretly observe the reactions of the two people beside him and he felt a little worried.</p><p>But very quickly, he discovered that he had somewhat judged the heart of a gentleman with the heart of a villain.</p><p>Mei Siren laughed, waved his paper fan and then said, “I appreciate your kindness, but I can’t take the Holy Miracle Fruit.”</p><p>On the one hand, he felt that as a Teacher, he had not even given his student a gift at their first meeting. How could he even accept his gift?</p><p>On the other hand…</p><p>Mei Siren didn’t want to say it at first, but when he saw Xu Xiaoshou’s stunned expression, he could only explain helplessly. “It’s already very hard for me to suppress my cultivation level. If I touch this Holy Medicine, I’ll probably become a Saint on the spot. This is not what I want.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>This reason was a little too scary…</p><p>However, what Master Siren said was right. Based on his previous situation where he almost became a Saint on the spot, it was clear that he was not being pretentious.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t insist. He looked at the other two as he held the Holy Miracle Fruits in his hand.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong thought for a while and then he also shook his head and said, “Keep this for yourself. An Ancient Swordsman may need resources in the early stages, but I don’t lack them now. On the contrary, if I swallow the Holy Miracle Fruit, it may affect my will.”</p><p>An Ancient Swordsman was very particular about his mind cultivation.</p><p>Since he was determined to walk this path, Xiao Kongtong would not allow himself to be tempted by external things.</p><p>He firmly believed that he could become a Saint, but not by relying on external objects. If he wanted to obtain Holy Power, he could only become a Sword Saint after he performed what he thought was the best in the future.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart went numb.</p><p>Why would they, who were both Ancient Swordsmen reject the Holy Miracle Fruit so calmly?</p><p>You might not be aware of this, but two people at the higher void level gave up their lives for this item!</p><p>But on second thought…</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>Those who were willing to sacrifice their lives for the Holy Miracle Fruit could only be at that level.</p><p>Who were the two people in front of him? This was the peak group of people in the continent. Not only were their current combat strength unparalleled, but their future path would also be smooth.</p><p>As for the likes of the Double Dumba*s and Hong Dang, they were already at the end of their roads and had reached the peak of the higher void level. They had no choice but to fight for the Holy Miracle Fruit and their future.</p><p>This was the fundamental difference.</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>Mei Siren looked approvingly at Xiao Kongtong. After he discovered that this person wasn’t Bazhun’an, he cherished his talent even more.</p><p>In this world, there were only a handful of people who could succeed in the impersonation of Bazhun’an.</p><p>This meant that Xiao Kongtong’s own Way of the Sword strength was undoubtedly second to none among the younger generation.</p><p>Therefore, for the sake of this young man’s future, even if Xiao Kongtong chose to take the Holy Miracle Fruit, Mei Siren would not let him have his wish.</p><p>The strength of an Ancient Swordsman could not be obtained by relying on external objects, with the exception of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Of course, Mei Siren did not look down on Xu Xiaoshou. He understood that the path Xu Xiaoshou had chosen was wider and more difficult.</p><p>Swordsman, Spiritual Cultivation, Forging…</p><p>Even Conducting Alchemy, Spiritual Array, and other unorthodox methods…</p><p>If it had been someone else, Mei Siren would have thought that the person was useless and that he had made himself useless.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou’s actions proved that he could take care of all these. His energy could indeed be distributed to so many paths. He was such a monster.</p><p>There were indeed such geniuses in this world.</p><p>Mei Siren was aware of this, so he was tolerant towards Xu Xiaoshou, while his attitude towards Xiao Kongtong was ‘You just have to focus on your current path. If you dare to mess around, imitate those messy people and practice some messy stuff and destroy your perfect talent in the Way of the Sword, then you’ll be punished.”</p><p>“It’s just from my heart, Master Siren is too kind.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong felt flattered and thanked the senior of the Way of the Sword in front of him for his praise. He then turned to Ye Xiaotian.</p><p>He smiled and said, “This Ancient Swordsman does not need it. The Holy Miracle Fruit is definitely very helpful for Spiritual Cultivators below the Demi-Saint level. I think you’ll need it.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian stared blankly at the two people beside him who had rejected the Holy Miracle Fruits. For a moment, he felt like he was the ‘villain’.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
