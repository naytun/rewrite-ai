(Part 2)</p><p>“Why should I kill it?”</p><p>However, the winged black demon Berserk Giant’s actions were clearly brainless.</p><p>After a glance, it roared and pounced with the two swords in its hands. It raised its hands and slashed wildly.</p><p>The ancient giant that came from the chaos was extremely burly. No matter how big the winged black demon Berserk Giant was, it was only the size of its toe.</p><p>However, at this moment, endless sword energy blasted over and forced the ancient giant to retreat.</p><p>After all, Xu Xiaoshou was the master of the spiritual world, not to mention that the winged black demon Berserk Giant had already devoured a large number of devils!</p><p>Slash! Sizzle!</p><p>The sword light slashed out a bloody light, and Xu Xiaoshou was shocked by his own combat strength.</p><p>At this moment, he truly realized what it meant to be supercilious, unyielding and invincible.</p><p>When the last sword flew out and ruthlessly stabbed into the ancient giant’s heart, Xu Xiaoshou felt that his spirit had been sublimated. Once again, he let go of his desires and ignited the heroic spirit in his heart to the extreme.</p><p>“Why should I kill it?”</p><p>“I can replace it!”</p><p>The Fourth Sword in his hand stabbed and pulled out.</p><p>The words of the spiritual world were the law, and the rules were summoned. The seemingly invincible ancient giant was directly transformed into the purest energy and fused into the body of the winged black demon Berserk Giant.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that his spiritual body was growing vigorously, and every muscle seemed to be growing again after being torn apart.</p><p>The world began to shrink in his eyes.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“It’s me. I really obtained the ancient giant’s body and became the strongest expert!”</p><p>When it stood up again, the winged black demon Berserk Giant had evolved to an outrageous level.</p><p>It was almost higher than the entire world!</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou roared out loud, feeling that he had vented all his emotions.</p><p>He could also feel that his spiritual will seemed to have broken through a bottleneck and disappeared with a crack.</p><p>He knew that after crushing the ancient giant and becoming an ancient giant, he would no longer have to worry about the time needed to accumulate aura for swallowing the mountains and rivers.</p><p>He was a giant now!</p><p>With just one glance, he could make his enemies feel the despair that he had experienced in that fantasy realm!</p><p>“So the real ‘Swallow the Mountains and Rivers’ is not to imitate the giant’s aura to crush others, but to become the giant, and then others become the original me – the humble and weak me!”</p><p>With this thought in mind, Xu Xiaoshou’s vision was completely opened.</p><p>He took control of his spiritual body. This huge winged black demon Berserk Giant clenched its hand, and the endless devilish energy in his spiritual world was retracted into his palm.</p><p>“Bam!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou returned to his human form and shrank to the size of a normal human before he landed in the chaos.</p><p>What was different from before was that everything on his body had changed.</p><p>The endless devilish energy turned into a black robe that emitted an evil aura and covered his body. This represented all the evil powers he had displayed before.</p><p>His black hair and black eyes became purer and darker. It meant that he could still clearly control his own power even in the state of cultivation deviation.</p><p>He raised his hand, and the black sword, which was condensed from the endless devilish energy wandering in his spiritual world, began to move unsteadily, adding a bit of amusement to the evil atmosphere.</p><p>“Hidden Bitter…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was dressed in devil-invasion black clothes, murmured softly. His eyes flickered as if he had understood something.</p><p>“Perhaps, from the moment I got you, from the moment I named you, this moment was destined. I was destined to suffer in this life.</p><p>“In reality, we still can’t reach the peak.</p><p>“However, in the world of the Heart Sword Technique, you were able to hide all of my suffering for me, and hand it over to my future enemies.”</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>He tilted his sword, and a black sword energy flashed in the chaos world, tearing the galaxy apart.</p><p>Everything in the world was dyed black by this sword in an instant. He could foresee that someone would really be hit by this sword.</p><p>Cultivation deviation was a normal state.</p><p>Whether or not he could escape from the influence of the demonic wills that had been devoured by the winged black demon Berserk Giant was the key to escaping from the Heart Sword Technique.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou understood that he had succeeded.</p><p>As long as he opened his eyes in the real world, he would be able to wake up and use all the abilities displayed in this illusory world of will on the specific application of the Heart Sword Technique – the Present Gods and Buddhas!</p><p>But he didn’t want it to end.</p><p>“Not enough!</p><p>“It’s not enough!</p><p>“It’s far from enough!”</p><p>The sword was tilted. In the black chaotic world, a purer black shadow leaped up, broke through the chaos, and seemed to want to leave the world.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised the black sword in his hand high, knowing that his Present Gods and Buddhas must not be limited to this!</p><p>He was ambitious, very ambitious!</p><p>Either he doesn’t practice it, or he would practice it until he was the strongest.</p><p>In the five regions, the strongest ancient swordsman of today’s era, like the Bazhun’an and Master Siren, had their Present Gods and Buddhas and sword images swallowed in their own worlds.</p><p>However, in the long river of time, there must have been more bizarre and powerful powers that he had not devoured and digested, right?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know if there were any ancient swordsmen that surpassed the Bazhun’an in the past.</p><p>However, he also understood that it did not matter whether it existed or not, because as long as he swallowed the imagery, he could truly be godless, faithless, and lawless!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
