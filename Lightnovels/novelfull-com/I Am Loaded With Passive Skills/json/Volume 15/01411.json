He couldn’t even protect that little fellow.</p><p>“Teacher, I’m sorry. I messed up. I messed up everything…”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong lay half-paralyzed and hit the ground with his head as he mumbled powerlessly. In his eyes, there was only a deep hatred for his own incompetence.</p><p>…</p><p>Next curtain call, a different scene.</p><p>Mei Siren could sense the pain of the people around him.</p><p>He was the calmest of the lot and did not reveal any abnormal fluctuations.</p><p>However, as the most senior and strongest expert present in the Arena, he couldn’t even protect a disciple who had yet to enter the sect.</p><p>The pain that Mei Siren suffered in his heart at this moment was similar to what Jiang Buyi had said – the pain of one’s body being dismembered by a thousand cuts was a hundred times more painful than this!</p><p>One Aura…</p><p>Three Auras…</p><p>Ten Auras…</p><p>After the time it took for half an incense stick to burn down, Mei Siren could not stay still anymore.</p><p>The calmer his body was, the crazier his state of mind became. It was because the heart-piercing words that Jiang Buyi said at the end constantly reverberated in his mind.</p><p>At a certain moment, Mei Siren suddenly looked up.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>The Saint Calamity Clouds of the Nine Heavens surged and gathered in the air.</p><p>Mei Siren’s eyes flashed like lightning. As soon as he looked up, the Sword Will around him spread out and instantly surged across the entire Abyss Island.</p><p>“Rumble, rumble, rumble…”</p><p>A large area of the Forest of Miracles collapsed.</p><p>The Saint Calamity was summoned and it almost solidified. The purple lightning reflected in it looked like it would strike in the next second.</p><p>“Master Siren!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong who was still immersed in the pain of Xu Xaoshou’s death tried hard to recover from the damage caused by the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree, .</p><p>When he saw this, he was shocked. He had to temporarily suppress his emotions and shouted out loud.</p><p>“Jiang Buyi, that old thief, is trying to provoke you. Master Siren, you must not fall into his trap. This was his last trick!”</p><p>Mei Siren’s body trembled in mid-air, and he wanted to stop.</p><p>How could he not know that this was Jiang Buyi’s last move!</p><p>However…</p><p>If he didn’t kill this person, how could he eliminate the hatred in his heart?</p><p>How could he kill the Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi if he did not enter the Saint realm?</p><p>“Trapped, Saint, sensed, imprisoned, abandoned, restrained.”</p><p>“As well as the loss of freedom.”</p><p>Mei Siren already understood everything, but he could not stop his own actions.</p><p>Because of the Way of the Sword, he could no longer suppress his own realm and could only break it.</p><p>The Semi-Saint person flew out of his body, and under the horrified gazes of Ye Xiaotian and Xiao Kongtong, Mei Siren floated high up in the air.</p><p>“He’s…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian recovered from his shock and touched his chest and found that the crystal gem was still there.</p><p>In other words, Mei Siren had already prepared the Semi-Saint person long ago, just as he said.</p><p>“Becoming a Saint is just a matter of a thought.”</p><p>However, at that moment Ye Xiaotian and Xiao Kongtong thought of another sentence that Mei Siren had said.</p><p>“Freedom is what I want in my entire life,”</p><p>But now, for Xu Xiaoshou’s sake, Master Siren was about to give up his neutral identity and freedom to become a Saint on the Abyss Island and completely enter into the game?</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>The Semi-Saint person roared toward the Nine Heavens. The clouds changed colors, and everything in the world began to tremble.</p><p>Mei Siren had already lost everything. He knew that he could have been affected by the Demi-Saint’s will, but so be it…</p><p>“Jiang Buyi, you have indeed checkmated this old man!”</p><p>“That’s why this old man has to kill you, even if it means going to the ends of the earth!”</p><p>Mei Siren no longer paid any attention to what was happening below. Even though Xiao Kongtong tried his best to dissuade him and even Ye Xiaotian had realized that something was wrong and tried to persuade him, even though one of the two giant Void Attendants, who had cowered and crouched with their hands around their heads, suddenly stood up and staggered towards them…</p><p>“Roar!” the Void Attendant roared.</p><p>Mei Siren was not in the least bothered by it. Other people were afraid of the Void Attendant, but he wasn’t.</p><p>Moreover, during the Saint Calamity, anyone who dared to enter the site when he was about to transcend the tribulation would die without a doubt.</p><p>“Roar!” The Void Attendant continued to roar as it tried to speak.</p><p>However, Mei Siren did not want to make a move. He was just a Void Attendant who seeked his own death. He was determined to transcend the tribulation. If this giant came over, he would only suffer in the end.</p><p>“Stupid.”</p><p>The Void Attendant was so anxious that it spoke in the human language!</p><p>However, it seemed to have realized something and hurriedly held back its urge to curse. Its two big sparkling eyes rolled in its eye sockets, and a sudden Spiritual Light flashed across its face.</p><p>After that, the Void Attendant bent over, propped one hand on its knee and freed up its other hand to point at Ye Xiaotian and Xiao Kongtong’s heads, and spoke intermittently to them in human language.</p><p>“Humans… sad…shame… ”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian : “???.”</p><p>Xiao Qianqian : “???.”</p><p>“Was this big guy crazy?”</p><p>“How dare you provoke us?”</p><p>“Did it not know what ‘exasperation’, ’emotional shift’, and ‘killing Giants to vent their anger’ meant?”</p><p>The other Void Attendant behind him also looked up and was stunned.</p><p>“Brother! Are you crazy?”</p><p>“You saved my life, but you came late. You didn’t see how that old man killed a Demi-Saint with one strike, did you? Why did you just rush out? You’re courting death!”</p><p>“Fortunately, you only provoked those two little humans and not that old human. He actually dared to cross the Saint Calamity on the Abyss Island…” Even the Void Attendant was terrified. What kind of person was he?</p><p>But the next second, it was stunned again.</p><p>The Void Attendant who had come out of nowhere nodded toward the two humans. He was still not satisfied. He turned his huge head and reached out to touch the old Elder.</p><p>“He’s about to transcend the tribulation!”</p><p>“You touched his head?”</p><p>The Void Attendant went berserk. It almost rushed forward to pick up its buddy.</p><p>However, before it could make a move, the Void Attendant really showed what it meant by ‘the ignorant are fearless’. Not only did it dare to touch the one who was about to transcend the tribulation, but also dared to mock him.</p><p>“Sword Deity…in the middle… shame…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
