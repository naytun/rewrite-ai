He paused for a moment, and his eyes became a little erratic. Then, he tried his to describe it, “Close your eyes, meditate, empty your mind, start your imagining… when you end your imagining, then open your eyes?”</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong couldn’t help bursting into laughter.</p><p>If you were to say that the Heart Sword Technique was superior, then it truly was! That was because what they dabbled in were all illusory and mysterious things.</p><p>But if you say it was very ordinary, it was also true! This was because the cultivation method of the Heart Sword Technique was as simple as how Master Siren had described it.</p><p>If you can make your ‘visualization’ materialize after completion of this process, it would be considered a success. If not, it would be equivalent to having a ‘day dream’, and it would be the kind of dream that was extremely embarrassing if it were made known and the sort to make people laugh their teeth off!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was too difficult to teach. Xiao Kongtong shook his head.</p><p>The Heart Sword Technique was such an abstract concept; how could he possibly use specific words to describe it?</p><p>How could he ask Master Siren to explain these things in the simplest form, when it could only be understood but not described?</p><p>Even I felt embarrassed for Master Siren. When I thought about this, I saw Mei Siren’s glare from the side, and the Sword Image behind him also turned its head.</p><p>“Hah!” Xiao Kongtong was so frightened that he immediately reined in his emotions and his expression settled into its usual calm demeanor and he looked like an obedient student in class.</p><p>“Just that?” Xu Xiaoshou waited for a long time, but there was no further response.</p><p>“Just that!” Mei Siren couldn’t help but raise his voice.</p><p>What else do you want?</p><p>I slashed you earlier with a sword so you could have the greatest experience of life and death, that allowed you to use this ‘upper limit’ to break through.</p><p>Now I even added these ‘descriptions’, was that not enough? What else do you want!</p><p>At a certain moment, Mei Siren even suspected that Xu Xiaoshou was toying with him.</p><p>“+(Criticized, Passive Points + ) +2”</p><p>“+(Condemned, Passive Points +) +2.”</p><p>“That’s too easy!” Who would have thought that Xu Xiaoshou didn’t feel that these descriptions were illusionary, shameful and indescribable? He just didn’t know how to start.</p><p>Now, with this simple explanation from Master Siren, he knew what to do.</p><p>The normal process was to close one’s eyes and cultivate. Nothing more than that!</p><p>The Heart Sword Technique was very simple, but it was also very difficult. Of course, Xu Xiaoshou wouldn’t be stupid enough to think that this simple practice process was the entirety of the Heart Sword Technique.</p><p>He knew that the most important thing was the realization of the ‘intent’, not the mere act of closing and opening his eyes.</p><p>And about this ‘intent’.</p><p>Although Xu Xiaoshou had never really tried this level of cultivation before, it was not as if he had never come into contact with it.</p><p>The cultivation of ’10 Sections of the Finger Sword’ was the combination of body, mind, and will. The ‘Swallow the Mountains and Rivers’ was also the condensation of force and intent.</p><p>With the appearance of the passive skill of ‘Swallow the Mountains and Rivers’, this type of cultivation foundation had already been engraved into Xu Xiaoshou’s bones.</p><p>Apart from that, he also had the Sword Technique Expertise, which allowed him to grasp the knowledge of the Heart Sword Technique. The only thing he didn’t know was how to use this knowledge and release it.</p><p>“I’ll start now.”</p><p>Under Master Siren’s gaze, under the pressure of the Sword Image and amid the expectations of Xiao Kongtong, Xu Xiaoshou sat down cross-legged on the spot and slowly closed his eyes.</p><p>“Get rid of all distracting thoughts and enter into the meditation stage.”</p><p>Under Master Siren’s watchful eyes, when Xu Xiaoshou started, there seemed to be a soothing voice that became like the sound of the Great Path from the beginning. It helped Xu Xiaoshou to quickly settle down and eliminate all distracting thoughts in a very gentle way.</p><p>“Heart, will, sword…”</p><p>Under the influence of external forces, Xu Xiaoshou quickly entered a state of clarity and emptiness. He felt that everything in the world began to fade and finally disappeared.</p><p>Everything in the world ceased to exist, and only I am left in the world. Without a physical body, everything was illusory.</p><p>“The sword technique is famous. It’s called the Way of the Heart and is godless, faithless and lawless.”</p><p>Suddenly, the resonation of previous sword teachings appeared in his mind. Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was shaken. He knew that this was the seed that Master Siren had planted for him in advance, and it now started to take root and sprout.</p><p>Godless, faithless and lawless…</p><p>It could be said that the true meaning of the Heart Sword Technique was truly and thoroughly embodied in these words.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had entered a meditative state under Mei Siren’s Sword Image. He had also seen the Present Gods and Buddhas that Bazhun’an displayed in the Eighth Palace.</p><p>He and most of the beginners who studied the Heart Sword Technique were completely different from the Ancient Swordsman, who was ignorant about the Heart Sword Technique.</p><p>Because no matter how ignorant he was, he still had his vision and knowledge.</p><p>Apart from the so-called head of the Seven Sword Deity, old Master You Tu’s Heart Sword Technique, which might come as a surprise, the other Sword Deities main cultivation were presumably not the Heart Sword Technique.</p><p>However, old Master You Tu’s whereabouts had been unknown for many years, and he might have already perished.</p><p>Therefore, even if he had never seen the Present Gods and Buddhas of other Sword Deities, Xu Xiaoshou knew that the Heart Sword Technique he had seen in the past could be the strongest in this world!</p><p>What he needed to do now was to surpass the strongest and become even stronger!</p><p>What did it mean to be stronger?</p><p>In a chaotic world, on the left were Bazhun’an’s Present Gods and Buddhas and on the right was Master Siren’s Supreme Sword Image. Xu Xiaoshou could hardly imagine that anything could be stronger than these two.</p><p>However, it was precisely because he couldn’t imagine it that he had to.</p><p>“Even more!”</p><p>“What do you mean by ‘more’?”</p><p>There were two mountains right in front of him that made it hard for Xu Xiaoshou to breathe. He had a splitting headache and felt he was about to die on the spot.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
