He used the greatest pressure to force a person to grow at the fastest speed.</p><p>This was because Xu Xiaoshou had entered the game too early. If he did not grow quickly, he would soon become an abandoned pawn in the hands of the big shots.</p><p>Death was the only thing that awaited an abandoned pawn.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>While they were chatting, Xu Xiaoshou, who had been meditating beside him, suddenly trembled. His aura gushed forth like waves.</p><p>The surging Sword Will began to wreak havoc on the ancient long street. Xu Xiaoshou suddenly floated into the air like an ancient sleeping lion that had been awakened. His eyes were closed, but one could sense these ‘awakened’, ‘returned’ and ‘crazed’ vibes from his being.</p><p>“The poor and lonely are nurtured in the heart, while the body is as dispirited as an old tree.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong retreated a little and felt as if his spiritual world had been slightly affected.</p><p>He actually saw a trace of the Heart Sword Technique in Xu Xiaoshou’s body. When he saw the Teacher’s description of the Heart Sword Technique in this beginner, he found it unbelievable.</p><p>“This kid is under a lot of pressure. His ‘self’ is a little fierce and scary.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong glanced discreetly at the Sword Image that appeared behind Master Siren.</p><p>Perhaps the old Sword Deity had seen that Xu Xiaoshou’s ‘self” was not any weaker than him, so he was tempted to teach him how to use the sword?</p><p>“Indeed he is very fierce. I just don’t know how long he can maintain this state and whether he can find his true self.” Master Siren nodded slightly as the satisfaction grew in his eyes.</p><p>The Sword Image was behind him, but he did not move an inch and was not in the least affected by Xu Xiaoshou’s will.</p><p>“I can grasp it now…”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong said hesitantly, as he did a comparison in his heart.</p><p>Since they were of the same school, he could only use Master Siren as a comparison gauge.</p><p>This old Sword Deity held the sword for three days, and then took seven days to comprehend the chaotic form of the Present Gods and Buddhas in front of him. He had spent a total of ten days!</p><p>How long did Xu Xiaoshou take since his inception?</p><p>Half a year?</p><p>Let’s just say he held the sword for half a year!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
