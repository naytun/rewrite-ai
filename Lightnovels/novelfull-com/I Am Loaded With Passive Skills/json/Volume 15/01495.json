(Part 1)</p><p>“Then you should get ready!”</p><p>Turning his head, Xu Xiaoshou looked at Ghost Granny and said calmly, “I’ve already completed the preliminary work. The rest is up to you. When you’re ready to fight, just let me know.”</p><p>Although he was certain that the first stage of the Phantom Swords Technique, Spirits Controlling, wasn’t just a contract with a void general that represented the final stage. It definitely wasn’t the same as the first stage.</p><p>There had to be some method to enslave the spirit soul or some special technique that targeted spiritual attacks or defenses.</p><p>But with Hong, Xu Xiaoshou felt that it was enough for now.</p><p>Master Siren was sure that he had already stepped into the realm of Spirits Controlling. He could learn the remaining details in the future.</p><p>On the other side, Ghost Granny hesitantly said, “I don’t need to prepare anything….”</p><p>In fact, she also wanted to prepare something, but after thinking about it, she realized that she couldn’t prepare anything other than when she would die.</p><p>She had sealed most of the power of the body-eating soul escape after knowing that there was a battle to come. She had kept it for later use, so she could be said to be in her peak battle state.</p><p>If she delayed any longer, she might not be able to prepare anything special, but with Xu Xiaoshou’s comprehension, she could tell that this was not the case for him…</p><p>If he were to prepare for 15 minutes, he would be able to advance by a major realm!</p><p>“Then let’s start?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned his eyes to Master Siren, asking the old Sword Deity if there was anything else he wanted to tell him before the battle.</p><p>He wouldn’t let go of the hatred between him and Ghost Granny just because he had practiced the Phantom Swords Technique for a short period of time.</p><p>Even if the two of them had never faced each other directly before, she had come for his head. This was a life-and-death feud. The sooner he resolved it, the sooner he could be at ease.</p><p>From the moment he started to practice the Phantom Swords Technique, Xu Xiaoshou had made up his mind that even if his comprehension was not good, he would not be able to defeat Ghost Granny with only the Phantom Swords Technique.</p><p>His teacher, Mei Siren, and Fringe Moon Immortal City’s Eldest Senior Brother had no choice but to abide by the noble character of ancient swordsmen and keep their promise to release her.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou was not an upright gentleman. From the beginning to the end, he had been thinking about how to break the rules and use a spell technique other than the Phantom Swords Technique to secretly kill Ghost Granny.</p><p>Now, it seemed that there was no need for that. Hong was probably enough, right?</p><p>“Be gentle,”</p><p>No one knew who he was warning.</p><p>After saying that, Mei Siren only glanced at Xu Xiaoshou and did not say anything else. He flew straight into the night sky and stood side by side with Xiao Kongtong under the silver moon.</p><p>There was no special sense of ceremony. Mei Siren knocked the paper fan in his hand and said, ”</p><p>“Let’s start!”</p><p>On the long street at night, the originally quiet and peaceful atmosphere of sword practice suddenly became a little more somber with this voice.</p><p>The wind was blowing, and the moon was cold.</p><p>Almost at the very first moment, Ghost Granny’s attitude changed from that of a bystander to that of a participant.</p><p>She had witnessed the whole process of Xu Xiaoshou’s cultivation of the Phantom Swords Technique!</p><p>Even though it had only been an hour, she knew that this kid had just contracted a terrifying void general.</p><p>Since it was a life-and-death battle, there was no rule of a senior giving in to a junior. As an assassin, Ghost Granny would not let go of the opportunity to attack first.</p><p>“Body-eating soul escape, launch!”</p><p>She ignited the power that was sealed within her soul body in an instant. She had intended to use it to fight Xiao Kongtong to the death but was actually using it to escape.</p><p>With a loud bang, the dark, blood-green spiritual power expanded and exploded, wrapping Ghost Granny’s soul body into a huge ghost.</p><p>It had a ferocious ghostly face, sinister fangs, and terrifying blood-red eyes. If ordinary people looked at it, they would probably suffer a mental attack and their souls would be affected, temporarily falling into a state of paralysis.</p><p>However, Ghost Granny treated Xu Xiaoshou as an opponent of the same level.</p><p>She knew that this wasn’t enough, so she had to kill Xu Xiaoshou in a second before he could release the void general.</p><p>Only by severely injuring Xu Xiaoshou to the point where he couldn’t fight would she have a chance to turn the tables and win this battle, and leave with ease!</p><p>Void general…</p><p>Ghost Granny believed that she couldn’t win it!</p><p>“Shan Ling!”</p><p>The ferocious ghost turned into a ray of light and rushed to Xu Xiaoshou’s face in an instant.</p><p>Before the young man could react, Ghost Granny, who was wrapped in spiritual power, had already taken out her dagger-shaped soul holy weapon and used her finishing skill to cut off Xu Xiaoshou’s soul body.</p><p>Kill, kill…</p><p>If the assassination failed, she would immediately stop.</p><p>Ghost Granny had never thought that Xu Xiaoshou would be able to withstand her bullying.</p><p>She had been thinking about whether the Seven Sword Deity, Mei Siren, would step forward to help him block this one and only sure-kill move.</p><p>Once it was received, the outcome was decided!</p><p>…</p><p>Ambushed, Passive Points +1.</p><p>A sure-kill move came from the front!</p><p>Even though Xu Xiaoshou was prepared for the attack, Ghost Granny’s speed was so fast that the information bar still determined it was a sneak attack.</p><p>“Old thing, you’re indeed sly.”</p><p>Although he had never thought of letting her make the first move, Xu Xiaoshou was still angered by Ghost Granny’s shamelessness.</p><p>Was there a need to go all out against a mere Master Stage?</p><p>She was even more cowardly than him! This didn’t match her five-man assassin group’s careless attack style at all!</p><p>With the stone sword in his hand, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even have time to make any effective response.</p><p>However, he didn’t hesitate. He didn’t even use the game-breaking Vanishing Technique and take the easy way out. He faced Ghost Granny’s attack head-on and raised his head, his eyes wide open.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
