Even if the Cursed Yin Eye borrowed a little of its aura, it will bring you a lot of trouble once discovered. Also, this thing seems very evil and weird.”</p><p>“Although it was evil, Xu Xiaoshou had a body constitution that would not suffer from any culture deviation. When he thought of this, Mei Siren’s thoughts stagnated and he could only say helplessly, “You should be more careful.”</p><p>“I’ll be careful.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded solemnly.</p><p>Mei Siren was still a little worried. He looked up at the night sky, and his gaze seemed to be fixed beyond the boundaries of the Abyss Island.</p><p>“I’ve heard of the ‘strange sect’s evil technique’. Even though this sect was destroyed during the era of the Ancient Swordsman, some of their heritage are still around.”</p><p>“There is the Feng family in the Southern Region. If there should be an opportunity, I’ll bring you to meet Feng Tingchen. He might know more secrets.”</p><p>“Feng Tingchen?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned, but quickly realized that Master Siren was talking about Feng Tingchen, one of the Seven Sword Deity.</p><p>It was said that the Feng family’s ancestor, Feng Wuhen, was a figure from the same era as the Sword God Gu Louying. Even if he did not win the title of Sword God at that time, he still took the title of ‘God Sword, Feng Wuhen’.</p><p>The cultivation level of God Sword Feng Wuhen’s Way of the Sword was only below that of the Sword God Gu Louying.</p><p>In terms of the inheritance of the Way of the Sword, except for the Burial Sword Tomb, which could be traced back to the same ancient history, the Way of the Sword acquired by the rest of the Sword Deity could not be compared to the Feng family of the Southern Region.</p><p>As for Feng Tingchen, he was the descendant of God Sword Feng Wuhen’s bloodline. He had a proper Swordsman’s cultivation heritage.</p><p>Compared to forces like the Burial Sword Tomb, a faction which had once established a sect and accepted many disciples…</p><p>He exceeded them all!</p><p>The purity of his bloodline!</p><p>Of course, no one cared about this.</p><p>What outsiders cared about was that there was Feng Tingchen, one of the Seven Sword Deity from the Southern Region.</p><p>The Feng family of the Southern Region would train at least one Sword Deity who had powerful combat strength in every generation, but no one knew how they did it.</p><p>Also, the Seven Sword Deity, a supreme title that was even recognized by the Holy Divine Palace and spread across the five domains of the continent, was actually the rank of the Feng family of the Southern Region.</p><p>“If we calculate the time, it should be within the next few years…” No one knew what Mei Siren’s thoughts were as he pursed his lips.</p><p>“What?” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t understand.</p><p>“Master Siren is talking about the ranking of the new generation of Seven Sword Deity.” Xiao Kongtong squinted and said.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyebrows twitched, and his mind began to work.</p><p>“Da!”</p><p>Mei Siren smacked Xu Xiaoshou’s head with his paper fan and Xu Xiaoshou, whose thoughts had run wild, was in so much pain that he immediately clasped his head and shrank back.</p><p>The elderly Sword Deity immediately smiled and said, “It’s still a long journey for you. Don’t think too much about it. With your current cultivation in the Way of the Sword, if you want to take part in the contest with the new generation of the Seven Sword Deity, I’m afraid you’re not even fit to fill in their shoes.”</p><p>Pausing for a moment, he stared at the indignant and disbelieving Xu Xiaoshou and shook his head.</p><p>“Even though there weren’t many Ancient Swordsman in the current era, due to the influence of the Seven Sword Deity, all the major factions have tried to cultivate them.”</p><p>“The Eastern Region of the Holy Sword Land is no longer the center of the Ancient Swordsman. From the perspective of the vast five regions, the battle for the new generation of Seven Sword Deity will only be more intense.”</p><p>“There’s no age limit for the Seven Sword Deity’s competition. Not only do you young people have to defeat those of the same generation, but also those from the previous generation and those of the previous generation who lost to our Swordsman.”</p><p>“Unless…”</p><p>Mei Siren stopped talking and turned to glance at Xiao Kongtong. Then, he met Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes again and spoke with a lot of emphasis.</p><p>“Unless you can reach Xiao Kongtong’s level in the Way of the Sword within a few years, I will not let you go out and embarrass yourself.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost laughed out loud when he heard what he said.</p><p>But soon, he asked, “Teacher, are you saying that my Eldest Senior Brother will definitely have a place among the new generation of Seven Sword Deity?”</p><p>“Maybe,” Mei Siren’s reply was noncommittal.</p><p>“Eldest Senior Brother, how confident are you?” Xu Xiaoshou turned to Xiao Youyou.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong laughed and scratched his head and said humbly, “About thirty to fifty percent. I actually hope that the battle of the new generation of Seven Sword Deity will happen later. After all, the true young generation like yourself have not grown up yet, and I haven’t reached the final-stage in my Way of the Sword.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou:”!!!”</p><p>Good fellow!</p><p>Do you think that there’s no one who can fight in the world today?</p><p>“Received stimulation. Passive value,+1.”</p><p>The three of them chatted casually on the Abyss Island, where danger lurked everywhere.</p><p>Suddenly, at this moment, in the long street in the Fantasy Realm, Ghost Granny who had been running back and forth, suddenly stopped.</p><p>It was as if she had lost her soul. She no longer moved, and all the energy movements in her body disappeared.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Almost at the same time, Mei Siren, Xiao Kongtong and Xu Xiaoshou turned their heads to look at the empty shell of her body.</p><p>“I have an idea.” Xiao Kongtong’s lips twitched and his body swayed. Then another Xiao Kongtong actually walked out from within his body</p><p>“Master Siren, please wait a moment. I will bring her over for Xu Xiaoshou to test his sword skill.” Xiao Kongtong Number Two nodded slightly at Mei Siren. He then leaped into the air and flew into the distance in the night.</p><p>“What is this?” Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded.</p><p>He glanced at the Information Bar immediately and found that the frequency of ‘Illusion’ that appeared was the same as before.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
