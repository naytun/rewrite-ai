It was placed at the bottom of the list and could only be practiced when an Ancient Swordsman had matured.</p><p>There was no other reason.</p><p>A person’s imagination was limited by their ‘vision’ and ‘cognition’.</p><p>If you want a child to start to practice the Heart Sword Technique from a young age, what would he be able to visualize? It would probably be illusions of some large toys.</p><p>However, after one became a Sword Deity, one could then visualize their own Present Gods and Buddhas. The ‘self’ that could be chosen and modified would be really too much!</p><p>However, there were no absolutes in the world, for example, Master Siren.</p><p>Even during the previous era of the Swordsmen, 99% of the Swordsmen placed the Heart Sword Technique at the bottom of the list. Some of them though were like Master Siren, who had learned the Heart Sword Technique at the beginning.</p><p>There was a saying that went like this: ‘The supreme person can visualize the most powerful Present Gods and Buddhas, but the most ignorant too have a chance to visualize the most powerful and unconstrained Present Gods and Buddhas, and it was not limited to these two forms.’</p><p>This was because the latter’s imagination was not limited by ‘cognition’ and ‘vision’, and they could be completely free.</p><p>However, the probability of that happening was very small.</p><p>Apart from 99% of the people who cultivated in the normal way of the Swordsman, there was a one in a billion chance that the thing they visualized was not a ‘toy’.</p><p>Master Siren was an example!</p><p>However, this was the only example.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong didn’t object to Master Siren’s teaching because he knew that Master Siren’s school of thought was different from his own. Once he had completed his visualization, he couldn’t change it. If he wanted to break through again, he could only do it through the Heavenly Unravel.</p><p>This old Sword Deity’s Present Gods and Buddhas was divided into many stages. At the beginning, he could only visualize ‘chaos’. After that, he improved his Way of the Sword and perfected it. Finally, he would refine it till it achieved the final-stage!</p><p>This was the reason why Mei Siren when he first practiced the Heart Sword Technique and clearly was not aware of the other eight of the Nine Major Sword Techniques, was able to condense the Sword Image and all the terrifying monsters that were present in the Way of the Sword.</p><p>His Sword Image was perfected gradually after he cultivated and came into contact with the rest of the Nine Major Sword Techniques. It was only now that he could merge the Nine Major Sword Techniques and step into the final-stage realm.</p><p>In short…</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s own Heart Sword Technique was a variant awakening type; Master Siren’s was the self-evolving type.</p><p>These two were equally matched, and there was no difference between them. It all depended on the meaning of the ‘self’ presented by the level of the individual’s realm.</p><p>“Present Gods and Buddhas…”</p><p>On the other side, Xu Xiaoshou was also excited. He thought that Master Siren would do a progressive training that started with the 3000 Sword Styles and so on.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou felt that the increase in his combat strength was minimal.</p><p>The Nine Major Sword Techniques and 18 Sword Forms were different. As long as they were cultivated to the first realm, they would be able to fight against those at a higher realm.</p><p>However, although he had the Sword Technique Expertise as his foundation, Xu Xiaoshou knew that his realization quality was really not very good.</p><p>What if everyone’s expectations of me are too high, and I’m the same? What if my expectations are shattered in the end?</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou thought of this, he asked, “Then Master Siren, how do I execute the visualization method?”</p><p>“There’s no specific way to do it.”</p><p>Mei Siren held the paper fan in his hand and walked forward and said with certainty.</p><p>“The first step is the Heart Sword Technique. The purpose of this technique is to not have a fixed cognition limit and to bind your ‘self will’. This way, you can let your imagination run wild and visualize the most impossible and unrealistic Present Gods and Buddhas.”</p><p>“Even if your artistic conception is too strong, you can only visualize a ‘chaos form’ in the end.”</p><p>“But it doesn’t matter. We have all the time in the world to perfect our technique.”</p><p>Mei Siren stopped and looked over. He smiled and said, “Therefore, don’t be bound by reality, and don’t be limited by your cognition. Just try your best to visualize. I can see how strong your heart is and how talented you are in the Way of the Sword from the things you visualize.”</p><p>What he said seemed rather fake…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a little guilty after he heard this. He thought to himself, “Master Siren, have you forgotten that I’m really only a beginner on the path of the Ancient Swordsman? What I’ve done before was just to ‘draw a tiger and used a cat as a model’. You have to give me something more realistic, or I won’t understand at all.”</p><p>“What about the cultivation steps and the like?” Xu Xiaoshou asked again after some hesitation.</p><p>Cultivation steps?</p><p>Mei Siren was stunned for a moment. He took a deep breath, thought for a while, and said with uncertainty, “How do you usually cultivate? Can’t you just follow that method? Do you need me to teach you?”</p><p>The problem is that I don’t cultivate the usual way. My cultivation is through sleep and breathing. Xu Xiaoshou felt his teeth ache. He shook his head seriously and said, “Definitely not,”</p><p>“Why can’t it succeed?”</p><p>“There’s no reason, but it’s definitely not possible.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Mei Siren thought to himself, “I’m an Ancient Swordsman, why would I need to teach you, a half Spiritual Cultivator and a half Ancient Swordsman the method of Spiritual Cultivation?”</p><p>Looking at the serious expression on Xu Xiaoshou’s face, Mei Siren could only think that he wanted to complete the cultivation method of the Ancient Swordsman.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
