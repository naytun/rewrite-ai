(Part 1)</h1><p>1453 Is “Godless, Faithless, and Lawless” Equivalent to “Cultivation Deviation”? (Part 1)</p><p>Illusion, Array Eye…</p><p>At this moment, when the two Gold Hunting Token assassins realized that they were trapped in an Illusion Array, their hairs stood on end.</p><p>Except for those below the Demi-Saint realm, who else could make these two experienced killers step into the Illusion Array arranged on the opposite side without their knowledge?</p><p>This was virtually impossible!</p><p>Even if a Spirit Array Master was here, it was impossible!</p><p>“But why didn’t my formation-countering sensor ring? This can’t be an Illusion Array, at least not an ordinary Illusion Array!”</p><p>Elder Xie’s heart turned cold. He searched around and tried to locate the Array Eye. However, his thoughts and ideas were on completely different channels.</p><p>His formation-countering sensor had cost him a fortune.</p><p>Apart from the Saint-Stage Array and the art of Divine Secret, any Illusory Array below the Demi-Saint realm would definitely trigger a reaction.</p><p>So the Saint Stage was an Illusion Array?</p><p>No!</p><p>Ghost Granny had already said that those two had not reached the Saint realm!</p><p>They were definitely not Demi-Saints! Otherwise, if they had seen them through the Spiritual Banner, the two of them would be dead by now! It was just like when they had met the Saint earlier!</p><p>It was too late to think about it…</p><p>Since they were trapped, the only option was to look for a way out. Elder Xie and Ghost Granny cast aside their distracting thoughts and spread out their spiritual senses as they searched desperately for the Array Eye.</p><p>Who would have thought that after they used their spiritual senses to investigate, the two of them were stunned to find that although they had clearly crossed sixteen streets, they were still in the same position as before. It was as if they had not moved!</p><p>This meant that the person opposite them had set up an Illusory Array at their original position. It was even possible that he had overheard the entire battle plan that they had exchanged!</p><p>That’s impossible.</p><p>The timing did not match up…</p><p>When the two assassins thought of this, their thoughts froze.</p><p>The moment they heard the angry shout ‘Who’s courting death’, the two of them immediately sprang into action. How could the other side have time to set up an Illusion Array next to them?</p><p>It took time to set up an Array!</p><p>Elder Xie’s mind was in a state of panic.</p><p>He was afraid.</p><p>All he wanted to do now was to grab Ghost Granny’s head and shout, “I told you we should not have done anything. I told you there might be danger; we should have done the sacrificial refining of the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch before we made our move!”</p><p>“Don’t let your thoughts run wild, you idiot. Look for the Array Eye!”</p><p>Ghost Granny sensed Elder Xie’s furious gaze and screamed at the top of her lungs. Her voice was filled with fear.</p><p>Elder Xie steadied his thoughts. He knew that his mind had been disturbed by the Illusion Array. He did not dare to let his thoughts run wild anymore. The evil Qi that engulfed his body erupted and instantly wreaked havoc within a radius of several hundred miles.</p><p>However…</p><p>Within a radius of hundreds of miles, the dozens of streets were all the same… It looked like the street that they were on now!</p><p>“Endless cycle.”</p><p>The cold wind swept from the bottom of his feet to the top of his head, and Elder Xie’s heart almost stopped beating.</p><p>The range of this Illusion Array was too huge!</p><p>What was this?</p><p>“Clang clang clang…”</p><p>At this moment, after their fruitless search, the crisp sound of clashing weapons came from above.</p><p>“Up there…”</p><p>Ghost Granny let out a shrill cry as if she had finally come to her senses. She looked up and felt that she had been struck by lightning.</p><p>Elder Xie’s pupils suddenly shrank. He got into a defensive posture and looked up as well. In an instant, his body froze on the spot as if he had been petrified and could not move.</p><p>Above the Nine Heavens, a silver moon that almost covered the entire Kingdom of Giants hung in the sky. The cold moonlight shone down mercilessly, and all that could be seen were silver scales – but there was no moon on the Abyss Island!</p><p>What was even more terrifying was…</p><p>Under the full moon, a black figure stood with his back to the light as his swordsman’s robe fluttered in the evening wind.</p><p>He tried hard to see who it was and could vaguely make out the figure of a swordsman who carried a snake skin sack on his shoulder. The sound of metal hitting against metal seemed to come from it.</p><p>He had a handsome face and a gentle temperament, like a well-read scholar. In his gentle face, his squinty eyes were full of smiles, as mild as the moonlight in the night.</p><p>“Swordsman…”</p><p>“Illusion…”</p><p>Elder Xie and Ghost Granny’s hearts trembled violently. A single word popped up in their minds at the same time: Ancient Swordsman!</p><p>An Ancient Swordsman was synonymous with horror!</p><p>Under the survival of the fittest, the Ancient Swordsmen who were not successful in today’s era were all trash. And those who had matured could fight enemies of a higher realm; one could fight against a hundred demons!</p><p>“Gulp!”</p><p>At this moment, the hearts of the two Gold Hunting Token assassins turned cold.</p><p>Ghost Granny thought of her previous naive thoughts and wanted to jump up and slap herself hard. “What the hell was I thinking of? Ah!”</p><p>“Straight to the point! Aim for Xu Xiaoshou…” The only thought left in Elder Xie’s mind now was “Preposterous! It’s all Ghost Granny’s fault! Didn’t I say we should not have taken any action! D*mn!”</p><p>“Sixteen breaths.”</p><p>The middle-aged man with the silver moon on his back clutched the sack in his left hand tightly. He turned his head slightly and pressed two fingers on his temple with his right hand. He said in a serious tone.</p><p>“It took you a total of sixteen breaths to find me.”</p><p>“So, how long do you need to defeat me and break this Array Eye?”</p><p>The Array Eye of the Fantasy Sword Technique was the Ancient Swordsman himself!</p><p>Under the silver moon, a casual voice accompanied by great pressure came from the Nine Heavens. The aura of the man in the sky seemed to have an entire world at his back. It gave off a terrifying pressure that made people want to kneel down and pay their respects.</p><p>When Elder Xie and Ghost Granny heard this, they knew that if this person had taken action earlier, sixteen breaths would have been enough for them to be reincarnated sixteen times. How would they still dare to fight with this Ancient Swordsman?</p><p>At this moment, they only had one thought in their hearts.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>“Use all your strength and might and run for your life!”</p><p>However, how could this sword-robed man under the silver moon in the night not see through their expressions? In the past, everyone had the same thought when they faced him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
