(Part 1)</p><p>“His condition has improved slightly…”</p><p>“Maybe he can really walk out of the state of cultivation deviation alone!”</p><p>In the ancient street of the giant kingdom, Mei Siren was still guarding Xu Xiaoshou. He was anxious, but he did not interfere.</p><p>He just waited.</p><p>He was waiting for Xu Xiaoshou to give him a surprise, to prove his genius title!</p><p>Cultivation deviation was something that others couldn’t resolve themselves, but for geniuses, wasn’t it just a slightly bigger stepping stone?</p><p>If it was Bazhun’an who had come today and he had been possessed by the devil in front of them, Mei Siren believed that Bazhun’an would be able to resolve it on his own, because of his outstanding talent.</p><p>Then, since he had already set his sights on Xu Xiaoshou and placed great expectations on him, why not give him more time to see what kind of results Xu Xiaoshou could achieve in the end?</p><p>The Forest of Miracles, the “stories” that should have become “accidents” that opened the eyes of Mei Siren were all influenced by Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“The only…”</p><p>Mei Siren stared at the young man in front of him with a burning gaze. He clenched the stone sword in his hand and muttered.</p><p>Suddenly, Xu Xiaoshou’s body changed again!</p><p>This time, he was no longer like before, where he was about to be completely demonized countless times, but the effect was removed at the final moment by his own purification ability.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s fluctuation was even greater this time!</p><p>It was bigger than all the previous ones combined!</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>“Crack! Crack!”</p><p>The long street suddenly split open.</p><p>The surrounding city towers were affected by this invisible force, and countless cracks began to appear on the mosses on the walls.</p><p>It was as if an invisible hand of God had suddenly pressed down from the sky, causing the ground to sink three feet and making it difficult for people to breathe.</p><p>“This is?”</p><p>Mei Siren’s sword was like an elephant, resisting this sudden pressure. His heart actually throbbed a little.</p><p>“The manifestation of intent!”</p><p>This bit of pressure was nothing to Mei Siren, but it was manifested in Xu Xiaoshou’s body, which was in a state of cultivation deviation. Mei Siren instantly confirmed his thoughts and was overjoyed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou might have succeeded!</p><p>When he looked over again, in the blink of an eye, the young man who was floating in the air had already released a surging aura.</p><p>The aura that was visible to the naked eye was the manifestation of the intent! This was what the Heart Sword Technique required! At this moment, they turned into a wave of air and pushed away from Xu Xiaoshou’s body, covering hundreds of miles in an instant.</p><p>“Boom, boom, boom!”</p><p>The area around them went from cracking to being unable to withstand the force. With a loud rumble, everything collapsed.</p><p>Even the ground was pressed down by the momentum of Xu Xiaoshou’s body!</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Mei Siren was caught off guard and was pressed into the deep pit by the suddenly growing momentum.</p><p>He patted his butt and got up, but there was no anger on his face. On the contrary, it was full of joy!</p><p>“It’s done!”</p><p>“It’s definitely a success!”</p><p>He floated up and suppressed the sword image’s action of wanting to protect its master. Mei Siren was afraid that this would affect Xu Xiaoshou’s current state.</p><p>Even when he was flying, he used his spiritual source instead of his own Sword Will, as if he was afraid that this “dyeing” would have a negative effect on Xu Xiaoshou’s Sword Will.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>He returned to Xu Xiaoshou’s side and looked up, wanting to carefully check his current state.</p><p>The feeling of the person in front of him seemed to have changed.</p><p>The devilish energy surrounding his body due to cultivation deviation was no longer there, completely absorbed by Xu Xiaoshou’s body. He didn’t know if this was a good or bad thing.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s temperament had also changed. He had become very cold, no longer the sunny person that he was before he closed his eyes and meditated.</p><p>On the contrary, looking at him now, his whole body was filled with a cold and dark aura. This was definitely the effect of absorbing devilish energy into his body.</p><p>Mei Siren’s eyes wavered, and he was hesitant.</p><p>For a moment, he doubted his own thinking. Perhaps there was only one of the Bazhun’an, and Xu Xiaoshou could not reach his level.</p><p>If he really allowed this kid to cultivate in a state of cultivation deviation, it would be a disaster to his foundational roots, and the loss would outweigh the gain.</p><p>“It’s time to intervene.”</p><p>With a soft sigh, Mei Siren raised the stone sword in his hand, and the sword image behind him also began to move.</p><p>At this moment…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>In front of him, Xu Xiaoshou’s aura rose again. The intent he revealed was so strong that it turned into a pillar of energy that pierced through the clouds above the upper echelons!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Mei Siren’s eyelids twitched, and her heart was filled with disbelief.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s intent, his self, was actually strong enough to affect him.</p><p>Was this the result of a junior learning the Heart Sword Technique?</p><p>Was this a result of the backlash from the various pressures he had encountered in the past?</p><p>No!</p><p>It definitely wouldn’t be like this!</p><p>Perhaps in Xu Xiaoshou’s heart, under his past experience of being arranged by others, a seed of great ambition had long been planted in his heart due to all kinds of helplessness.</p><p>Now, however, the Heart Sword Technique had completely unleashed the seed!</p><p>Before he could think further, his sudden inspiration was already guiding his spiritual will. The danger was approaching!</p><p>Without any hesitation, Mei Siren pulled away and retreated more than a hundred feet away.</p><p>This was because he could sense that the danger this time was not from an outsider but from Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>Trying hard to compose his inner emotions, Mei Siren once again looked at Xu Xiaoshou, wanting to see what kind of surprise this kid could bring him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
