You woke up by yourself.”.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s body trembled, and he suddenly turned his eyes to look over. Due to the force he used, blue veins bulged on his face, and he roared with a red face and ears, “Impossible! You’re the one who saved me!”</p><p>Ye Xiao was speechless.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I lost my composure.” Yu Lingdi regained his calm, leaving only his pupils still slightly trembling.</p><p>He tried his best not to think about what had happened just now, and how he had fallen from the Saint Punishment Pillar. He only changed the topic and asked, “How did you guys get in?”</p><p>As soon as the question was asked, the gloominess in front of him seemed to have faded a lot.</p><p>Yu Lingdi could clearly see that the Dark Division Chief, who was always shrouded in shadows, suddenly raised her face, revealing the lower half of her beautiful jade white face. Then, her red lips opened and she spat out words like pearls.</p><p>“Father.”</p><p>With a thump, Yu Lingdi’s heart stopped beating. He asked in disbelief, “You, what did you hear?”.</p><p>Ye Xiao shook her head.</p><p>Just like what she had said before.</p><p>She had heard the word ‘father’ when she was passing by, that was all.</p><p>Yu Lingdi narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice, “That was just a nightmare. Let’s not talk about this…”.</p><p>“Since everyone is here,” He said, “We can only proceed to the next step, which is to stop the Abyss Island.”.</p><p>“Everything that’s happening right now is the plan of Bazhun’an! I already know everything, so I’ll just go to the First Hall of Sins and banish the island back to the spacetime turbulence. With that, everything will be forced to stop.” Right after he finished speaking, Yu Lingdi turned around and was about to leave.</p><p>Ye Xiao did not move.</p><p>She would only say a few more words when she encountered something that she was extremely interested in.</p><p>Without a doubt, what interested her the most was this Yu Lingdi, as well as the word he said when he woke up.</p><p>“I’m answering your question.”</p><p>A calm voice came from behind, and Yu Lingdi’s footsteps suddenly stopped.</p><p>What did that mean?</p><p>Was she just answering his question?</p><p>Yu Lingdi suddenly thought of what he had asked previously. It was “how did you guys get in”.</p><p>Her answer was “father”.</p><p>At this moment, his soul went blank, just like when he heard that person’s voice in his dream. Yu Lingdi completely lost his ability to think.</p><p>“You, what are you saying?!”</p><p>After a moment of shock, he turned around in anger.</p><p>If Ye Xiao didn’t explain it clearly today, he didn’t mind letting her know the price of blaspheming the dead.</p><p>Ye Xiao still did not say anything. She just waved her hand, and black gushed out of her body, turning into a dim light shadow in front of her.</p><p>Treading waves and clouds, Sea God’s Trident, Water-type Upanishad, Evil Sin Bow, Deep Sea World, void gate…</p><p>The final scene was a blurry figure of a man standing on the tip of a wave, wearing half a golden beast mask on his head!</p><p>“Golden…”</p><p>Yu Lingdi was stunned.</p><p>Almost at the same time, he matched this person with the figure that had appeared in the dream world just now.</p><p>“Impossible! That’s impossible!”</p><p>In front of Ye Xiao, Yu Lingdi remained calm, but he was frantically denying it in his heart. He did not want to believe that all of that was real.</p><p>Under the shadow, Ye Xiao’s red lips lifted, as if she was smiling. She said, “I was suspicious of his identity until I passed by this place and you called me ‘father’.”</p><p>With a boom, Yu Lingdi’s mind went blank. His eyes were listless as he raised his head and looked at the person in front of him who seemed to be smiling.</p><p>She would always hide in the dark.</p><p>She was more clear-headed than anyone else.</p><p>At this moment, the long sigh that he had forcefully erased and forgotten in the dream world appeared once again involuntarily and reverberated endlessly in the depths of his soul.</p><p>“Long time no see, my child…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
