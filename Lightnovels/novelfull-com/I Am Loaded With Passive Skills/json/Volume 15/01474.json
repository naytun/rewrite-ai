He asked about Xu Xiaoshou’s conditon, but he did not ask much about his previous ‘whipping corpse’ move.</p><p>As Master Siren had said, Xu Xiaoshou was very smart.</p><p>If he wanted to talk about something, he would naturally talk about it. If he didn’t want to talk about it, it was useless to ask more.</p><p>On one hand, he was worried, but on the other hand, he had confidence in Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>As long as this brat had not been bewitched and led astray, it would be very difficult for anyone in the world to corrupt his mind and will.</p><p>After all, the power of Xu Xiaoshou’s ‘self’ was strong and could be seen from the Present Gods and Buddhas in his eyes.</p><p>“I feel…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou touched the stone sword and pursed his lips. He glanced at the two Ancient Swordsmen in front of him.</p><p>“I think it’s a pity. That guy was an assassin from the Central Region and he was after my head.”</p><p>“I’ve read his soul memory and found out that he landed in a place called the Blood World after he entered the Abyss Island. He even obtained the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch.”</p><p>“It’s a pity that after his Cursed Yin Eye possessed his body, it was too powerful and caused his body to explode; we don’t even need to talk about his spatial ring.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong and Mei Siren were stunned.</p><p>Assassin, Blood World, Cursed Yin Eye?</p><p>It turned out that Xu Xiaoshou’s last action was to make a confirmation. That was just great.</p><p>He quickly came back to his senses after he digested the key points of these words, then rubbed his chin and frowned.</p><p>“I’m asking about your mental state after you executed the Heart Sword Technique, and not whether you were able to take his spatial ring.”</p><p>“The Heart Sword Technique is very taxing on one’s mental strength. Moreover, the imagery of the Present Gods and Buddhas that appeared in your eyes is a little too strong.”</p><p>“Your body, mind, and cultivation level, in theory, should not be able to support you to maintain such a full state of mind after having performed such a sword technique, right?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong scanned Xu Xiaoshou from head to toe as if he was some monster, as he tried to find some indication of his enduring strength.</p><p>However, this fellow was still full of energy. Was there even a sign of him being sucked dry by the Heart Sword Technique or Present Gods and Buddhas?</p><p>Mei Siren was visibly moved and he had a puzzled look on his face.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong had maintained his Fantasy Sword Technique all this while. He did not know that Xu Xiaoshou had already given Mei Siren a blow with the sword after he successfully cultivated the Heart Sword Technique.</p><p>If you included the sword attack he used against Elder Xie, Xu Xiaoshou had already used the Present Gods and Buddhas twice, no, three times in such a short period of time!</p><p>He had used two sword strikes on Elder Xie!</p><p>Judging from the state of a beginner in the Ancient Sword Technique, it would be normal if Xu Xiaoshou foamed at the mouth and was completely exhausted. There was even a possibility that he would be sucked dry.</p><p>Why was this kid still so energetic?</p><p>“You mean consumption?” Xu Xiaoshou was amused. “My physique is special. I’ve also learned a technique that can transform my spiritual consumption into physical consumption. My physical body is very strong, so I am basically not affected by the battle.”</p><p>His words were a hundred percent true.</p><p>Every time he used the Present Gods and Buddhas, it was indeed a huge mental drain.</p><p>However, he had a divine skill known as ‘Transformation’, and also ‘Eternal Vitality’ and ‘High Spirits’ which acted as energy supply stations all this time.</p><p>After three consecutive sword attacks, Xu Xiaoshou only felt a little tired after the sword strikes. After a while, he had almost recovered to his perfect state.</p><p>Battery life problem…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was never worried about this!</p><p>When they heard this, Xiao Kongtong and Mei Siren looked at each other speechlessly. It was as if they had some thoughts in their hearts.</p><p>“As expected. It’s the era of Spiritual Cultivation. The Ancient Swordsman’s methods are still a bit outdated in comparison.”</p><p>“So Spiritual Sword Fusion is the true path for the Ancient Swordsman?”</p><p>The two of them understood from what Xu Xiaoshou said that this special spiritual technique belonged to him alone.</p><p>And it was true that apart from Xu Xiaoshou’s background as an Ancient Swordsman, his Spiritual Cultivation background was also extraordinary.</p><p>He had Elder Sang, a former disciple of the Holy Palace, and a Demi-saint with an Infernal lineage behind him. He also had the means to read other people’s soul memories.</p><p>With all these support, it was not impossible for Xu Xiaoshou to cultivate such a spiritual technique like the Transformation…</p><p>“You got the Cursed Yin Eye?”</p><p>Mei Siren didn’t pay attention to those minor details. He thought of the aura of the ‘power of the evil god’ on Elder Xie’s body before and asked as he tapped his paper fan.</p><p>“Yes.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded. “Strictly speaking, I obtained… I mean, what Elder Xie obtained was only an incomplete version of the ‘strange sect’s evil technique’, the part which is the ‘Cursed Yin Eye’. With the Cursed Yin Eye, he can borrow a bit of the ancestral source power that Teacher mentioned before. However…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paused and turned to look at the place where Elder Xie had died and sighed, “He could not control this kind of power, and it was very easy for him to have a cultural deviation.”</p><p>When he heard the term cultivation deviation, Xiao Kongtong recalled that Xu Xiaoshou had a body constitution that would not suffer from any cultivation deviation and the corners of his mouth twitched.</p><p>This kid was the one who was truly abnormal, right?</p><p>From the looks of it, the Cursed Yin Eye of the strange sect’s evil technique was not suitable for the assassin from the Central Region, but was more suitable for Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>He followed Xu Xiaoshou’s line of sight. Xiao Kongtong stared silently at the arena that had undergone such a great battle but had not suffered too much damage.</p><p>Strange treasure?</p><p>The corners of his lips twitched and he was amused by his own thoughts.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
