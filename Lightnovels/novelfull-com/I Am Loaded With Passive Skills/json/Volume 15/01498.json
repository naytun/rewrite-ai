He couldn’t feel the pressure from Ghost Granny facing void general Hong, but he could see the Demi-saint’s Power from the spirit soul in front of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He looked at Master Siren beside him in confusion. He couldn’t understand how Xu Xiaoshou could successfully contract such a powerful spirit soul.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, a spirit soul that a ghost swordsman could contract with would usually be a spirit soul that did not exceed their own combat strength by much.</p><p>But someone like Xu Xiaoshou was obviously abnormal!</p><p>He had just started practicing the Phantom Swords Technique. No matter how powerful his soul body was, it was impossible for him to successfully contract a spirit soul that had mastered the Demi-saint’s Power, right?</p><p>“Master Siren, what is going on?” Xiao Kongtong couldn’t hold back his curiosity.</p><p>“I don’t know either.” Mei Siren shook his head while holding his paper fan, his eyes also filled with confusion.</p><p>Before void general Hong pulled out its sword, he had thought that even if the contract was successful, no matter how strong the spirit soul was, it wouldn’t be able to exceed the higher void’s combat strength.</p><p>But now, it seemed that Xu Xiaoshou had mastered the Demi-saint’s Power. With this spirit soul alone, he could become one of the higher void experts in the future.</p><p>However, his own combat strength was weak, which made it even easier for people to have the illusion that he was a wolf in sheep’s skin.</p><p>Well, maybe it wasn’t an illusion.</p><p>This kid had been pretending to be a wolf in sheep’s skin from the beginning to the end.</p><p>What other secrets did he have that no one else had seen through?</p><p>“In theory, there is a situation where the spirit soul and the ghost swordsman are both willing parties.”</p><p>Mei Siren thought for a while, stared at void general Hong, and said, “It won’t attack its master. Its master can also obtain the power of the spirit soul through prayer. However, Xu Xiaoshou’s prayer…”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong listened in silence, only to find it ridiculous.</p><p>He knew about the situation that Master Siren was talking about, but most of the time, this kind of situation occurred between people of the same clan and sect.</p><p>Before the powerhouses of the older generation passed away, they would take the initiative to become the contracted spirit souls of the younger generation in order to better protect their clan. They would become existences similar to old grandpas.</p><p>If a young man wanted to get the help of an old grandpa, he would definitely not use Enslave or Imperial Decree because these two methods would enrage the spirit soul.</p><p>It was possible that a simple reaction from a powerful spirit soul could hurt its master.</p><p>Thus, in such a situation, Prayer was born.</p><p>Ghost swordsmen and spirit souls were of the same level, and they could even use the weaker level to obtain power from the spirit soul and use it to fight.</p><p>However…</p><p>How could Xu Xiaoshou’s method be called Prayer?</p><p>“Fight! Until the end!”</p><p>“Blood! To the last drop!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong thought of these two sentences and his expression turned strange.</p><p>What was this?</p><p>Was it a special secret prayer for the void general’s power?</p><p>Was it an intimate way of communication that only Xu Xiaoshou and his spirit soul had?</p><p>“I don’t understand.” Xiao Kongtong expressed that he didn’t understand, but he was greatly shocked.</p><p>“It’s good that you don’t understand.” Mei Siren smiled. No matter if it was the Heart Sword Technique or the Phantom Swords Technique, he couldn’t understand them. But as long as he could use them, it was fine.</p><p>However…</p><p>“I still have a headache!” Mei Siren pinched the space between his eyebrows. The power of the void general had undoubtedly disrupted his teaching plan.</p><p>Originally, after the Spirits Controlling was completed, the strongest were actually the three unique combat methods of the ghost swordsman, which he was going to teach Xu Xiaoshou as he fought.</p><p>First, the ghost swordsman could apply the Nine Major Sword Techniques to their spirit souls through the Red Ghost Inscription. When performing the techniques with the hands of the spirit souls, he could transform them into soul damage.</p><p>The second was that through the Red Ghost Inscription, the ghost swordsman could obtain a portion of the spirit soul’s power to strengthen himself in battle.</p><p>The third was to fuse the two perfectly, without any distinction between them, to maximize one’s combat strength.</p><p>However, these three situations were undoubtedly established when the enemy’s combat strength was on the same level.</p><p>If the enemy was gone once the ghost swordsman’s spirit soul was summoned, why would there be a need for the ghost swordsman’s unique combat style?</p><p>However, it seemed that such an extreme situation had occurred.</p><p>“Let’s take a look first!”</p><p>Mei Siren crushed the slight frustration between his brows and tried to tell himself that this was actually a better situation. At least Xu Xiaoshou’s spirit soul was very powerful, and he would be safe from now on, wouldn’t he?</p><p>“It’s almost over…”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong kept his eyes on the battlefield. He could sense that Ghost Granny probably wouldn’t be able to take even one hit from the void general’s aura.</p><p>As long as the two-handed sword could be pulled out!</p><p>…</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was standing in the back like a pole without any sense of participation in the battle, also realized that something was wrong.</p><p>For example, at this moment, as a ghost swordsman, he should use a very gaudy and explosive sword technique.</p><p>Not only could it help Hong pull out its two-handed sword faster, but it could also increase the Passive Points of the audience.</p><p>Or, he could use the power of the Red Ghost Inscription to stimulate Hong’s combat strength to increase. Then, he could kill Ghost Granny instantly without even drawing his sword.</p><p>But…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also felt that the Phantom Swords Technique had such methods. There might be many more, but he didn’t know any of them!</p><p>He was vexed…</p><p>He was extremely vexed!</p><p>Therefore, he had no choice but to become a cheerleader for Hong. He waved his fists desperately and kept shouting shamelessly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
