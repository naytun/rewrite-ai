It was unlikely that with the guidance of Master Siren, he could comprehend the Gods and Buddhas just a few minutes after he entered into meditation.</p><p>That talent was much more terrifying than his and his Teacher’s!</p><p>At most, he would be like Master Siren, who had comprehended the chaotic form of Present Gods and Buddhas. Then, he would spend more than half a year polishing this skill and cultivating the Present Gods and Buddhas that belonged to him. Xiao Kongtong established this judgment quickly.</p><p>“Ka!”</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou, who was sitting cross-legged with his eyes closed, had an unstable aura, and it rose at a terrifying speed!</p><p>Soon, the surrounding long streets were filled with cracking sounds.</p><p>The high ancient city tower in the distance was affected by the Sword Will. It began to crack and collapse.</p><p>“Rumble, rumble, rumble…”</p><p>A deafening sound rang out. Mei Siren raised the stone sword in his hand and used the Fantasy Sword Technique to quickly construct a simple and crude illusory world. He also moved the surrounding phenomena into this fake time and space so that the sound of the explosion would not affect his beloved disciple, Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“This aura rose too rapidly. What did he encounter in the spiritual world? How much pressure was he under?”</p><p>As Xiao Kongtong felt the increasing pressure, all the pores on his body began to tighten, and he became serious and extremely alert.</p><p>How could the Master Stage Xu Xiaoshou have such an imposing aura?</p><p>Just how much had his ‘self’ been suppressed for it to bounce back so strongly?</p><p>Mei Siren’s gaze also changed from appreciation and satisfaction to one that was solemn and worried. He spoke in a slightly harsh tone.</p><p>“Bazhun’an has gone too far!”</p><p>“Not everyone belonged to him. What Xu Xiaoshou suffered in the Spiritual World was probably much more difficult than we think. I’ll definitely look for him and ask for an explanation later.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong silently glanced at the elderly Sword Deity and shivered and dared not reply.</p><p>He could only try to change the topic. “Master Siren, the Heart Sword Technique is focused on the cultivation of the heart. I’m worried that Xu Xiaoshou’s aura rose too quickly. It’s not a good thing and could be a danger.”</p><p>“Did you say ‘inner demons’?” Mei Siren’s eyes were fixed on Xu Xiaoshou’s Transformation.</p><p>“Something like that…” Xiao Kongtong lowered his head meekly. “What I mean is, if he forcibly crushed the Demi-Saint he faced before in the Spiritual World and experienced that ‘pleasurable feeling’, I’m afraid it’ll be a strenuous and thankless task. In the end, he might be harmed instead when he has additional distracting thoughts, which will in turn affect the progress of his Heart Sword Technique.”</p><p>He chose his words carefully.</p><p>Even so, these words had obviously angered Mei Siren.</p><p>“If it’s an inner demon, then it’s an inner demon. However, this is impossible!” Mei Siren’s eyes swept over him, but he quickly retracted his gaze and focused on Xu Xiaoshou’s condition.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was stunned by the Sword Image and he spoke fearfully.</p><p>“Yes, what you said makes a lot of sense!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is talented and has an extraordinary temperament. It’s impossible for him to have inner demons, unless he was affected by an external force.”</p><p>He stopped talking and laughed.</p><p>With Master Siren and himself here, who would dare to disturb Xu Xiaoshou’s cultivation?</p><p>Wouldn’t the person be skinned alive, given how protective Master Siren was?</p><p>At this moment, when the aura rose to the extreme, even the virtual world of the Fantasy Sword Technique constructed by Mei Siren was affected. It began to shake and was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s body suddenly trembled violently. He should have been totally immersed in the Spiritual World and should not show any emotions, but a trace of visible nervousness appeared on his face.</p><p>After that, faint black Qi began to overflow from his seven orifices.</p><p>“What’s this?” Xiao Kongtong’s pupils contracted.</p><p>“It can’t be, right?”</p><p>“Did I jinx it?”</p><p>Mei Siren turned and looked at him angrily. He did not say a word, but he felt that this old Sword Deity had already said it all. He almost wanted to dig a hole in the ground and bury himself.</p><p>“Don’t let anything happen. You can’t let anything happen to you. If something happened to you, I’ll be in trouble too.” Xiao Kongtong peeked at Master Siren, clasped his hands and began to pray.</p><p>However, the more one was afraid of something, the more likely it would happen!</p><p>As far as the eye could see, after the initial abnormality, Xu Xiaoshou’s body trembled violently, and the Sword Energy in his body split up, as if he had gone the wrong way. His body cracked and bled, and a majestic devilish energy surged out.</p><p>It resembled Elder Sang who had been hit by the arrow of the Evil Sin Bow, and he was totally in a state of cultivation deviation.</p><p>“You and your jinxed mouth!” Finally, Mei Siren couldn’t bear it anymore. He raised the stone sword in his hand and was about to strike.</p><p>“It’s not my fault.” Xiao Kongtong was so scared that he jumped up and was about to leave.</p><p>At this moment, both of them seemed to have realized something. They turned their eyes in disbelief and looked into the distance. It was indeed not his jinxed mouth, but someone had really disturbed Xu Xiaoshou’s cultivation state!</p><p>No!</p><p>This also seemed to be a doomsayer!</p><p>“Who did this?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong subconsciously wanted to make up for what he said earlier, so he set off to find the person so he could personally beat that person to death.</p><p>But the next second, he quickly realized that the atmosphere was not right.</p><p>It solidified! It was shocking and horrifying!</p><p>The Eldest Senior Brother of the Fringe Moon Immortal City felt like he had fallen into a quagmire. Xiao Kongtong couldn’t even take a step, let alone catch anyone.</p><p>He tried to turn his head with difficulty and then Xiao Kongtong tried to move…</p><p>He felt that Master Siren who was beside him had changed. He was no longer that gentle old senior. It was as if he had suddenly evolved into a different person.</p><p>If he didn’t take action now, it would be too late!</p><p>A terrifying suffocating aura engulfed him and it felt like some god had stabbed a volcano in the absolute ember fire domain with a divine needle and stirred it countless times.</p><p>It was predictable…</p><p>In the next second, there would definitely be a world-destroying volcanic eruption!</p><p>Xiao Kongtong twisted his head with all his might and finally managed to turn around to look in the direction where Master Siren was.</p><p>At this moment, a thunderous sound exploded in his ears. It was as if it wanted to completely shatter his mind and soul body. It was crazy and terrifying.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was so scared that his heart nearly stopped.</p><p>What he saw was the Sword Deity’s extremely serious and gloomy face. It was flushed red because of the force he had used, and even the blue veins on his neck were clearly visible.</p><p>Mei Siren stared fixedly at the direction in the distance.</p><p>He gritted his teeth as his anger soared toward the sky. If he opened his mouth again, the Present Gods and Buddhas would be forced out. However, he did not dare to act rashly and only dared to cover his ears.</p><p>As expected, a suppressed and deep voice suddenly emerged from between the elderly Sword Deity’s teeth. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Who’s courting death?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
