It didn’t mean that Xiao Kongtong Number Two, who was some distance away, was also fabricated by the Sword Technique.</p><p>Otherwise, the Information Bar would have given him a timely response!</p><p>And if Xiao Kongtong Number Two had not been fabricated by the Fantasy Sword Technique, it meant that this was a real person!</p><p>However, if he was a real person…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shot a glance at Xiao Kongtong Number Two, who disappeared into the night sky in the distance, and then turned to look at Xiao Kongtong Number One. His eyes subconsciously widened.</p><p>“You are a Demi-Saint? You’ve already mastered the Demi-Saint Incarnation? You’ve hidden it so well!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was amused.</p><p>“Teacher isn’t even a Demi-Saint yet. How would I dare to overstep my boundaries?”</p><p>“This is the Sword Cognition Incarnation, a way to use the Penetrating Divine Senses. It can split into a clone with basic self-awareness, judgment, and combat power. It’s similar to the Demi-Saint Incarnation. Do you want to learn…”</p><p>He explained, but before he could even finish, Mei Siren stepped in between Xiao Kongtong and Xu Xiaoshou. He looked into the distance and spoke.</p><p>“That person should be a higher void level and proficient in the Dao of the soul.”</p><p>“Since it was not hard for you to master the Heart Sword Technique, I’ll teach you the Phantom Swords Technique. Remember, don’t bite off more than you can chew. You have to remember to do it one step at a time. Do you understand, Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong stood behind Mei Siren. He did not finish his sentence and had an awkward look on his face.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou really wanted to master this Sword Cognition Incarnation.</p><p>If he had mastered this move before, when he faced Jiang Buyi, he need not have had to ‘cut off his own arm’ and use the morph forms and could have gotten away with it.</p><p>But Master Siren’s attitude…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly understood something.</p><p>Master Siren only came into contact with me only recently and had just taught me the Heart Sword Technique. I entered the realm so quickly that I mastered the Present Gods and Buddhas immediately.</p><p>He’s afraid that once I master too many Sword Cognition and Sword Cognition Incarnation from the other sects, this would change the relationship of disciple apprentice between us and I would not give him the due recognition.</p><p>Well, I haven’t even mastered his Sword Image, which was the combination of Present Gods and Buddhas and the Penetrating Divine Senses, but I’ve already mastered Bazhun’an’s Sword Cognition.</p><p>Now that ‘big-mouth’ used this Sword Cognition Incarnation to tempt me…</p><p>In addition, I have another Master, Elder Sang…</p><p>At this point, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly had a revelation.</p><p>His expression was bland and he restrained his desire and passion for the Sword Cognition Incarnation. He nodded, looked at the two people in front of him and spoke seriously.</p><p>“It would be too ambitious for me to master the Sword Cognition Incarnation now. I’m still a newbie and have to take it step by step. The Phantom Swords Technique is pretty good and that is what I lack now – the method to use the Dao of the soul.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was clearly trying to win his Teacher’s favor.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong stood across from him and his expression became a little distorted and he had to refrain himself forcibly from throwing up when he heard this.</p><p>You, Xu Xiaoshou, don’t have any lofty ambitions?</p><p>Your words are so touching, even I am moved by them.</p><p>Mei Siren smiled in satisfaction.</p><p>The other side of the paper fan, which was originally meant to be shown at the end of the sword teaching path on the Abyss Island was suddenly displayed under the impetus of joy.</p><p>He deliberately swished the paper fan in his hand quickly and allowed the draught to blow his smile up to the tip of his eyebrows.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou and Xiao Kongtong’s eyes focused on the fan.</p><p>There was no longer the contemptuous ‘Are you stupid?’ aura. Instead, it was replaced by a few words that were very formal and serious.</p><p>“You’re teachable.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
