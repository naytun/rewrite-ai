Please make up for your mistake within ten days!”</p><p>“Sinner No. 945116, your unauthorized actions have violated the rules of Abyss Island. From now on, every time you make a move, the countdown to your exile will be reduced by one day. Please behave!”</p><p>Just as he was about to leave the Forest of Miracles, these two pieces of information suddenly flashed in Jiang Buyi’s mind. He was stunned.</p><p>“What was that?”</p><p>Even though Jiang Buyi was a demi-saint of the Northern Region of the Shengshen Continent, he had never heard of the specific rules of Abyss Island. He did not know how he had triggered the two taboos.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi immediately looked around.</p><p>However, no matter how hard he searched, he couldn’t find the person who had caused him trouble. Then again, it seemed that no one on Abyss Island could create such an illusion for a demi-saint.</p><p>Not human…</p><p>Then, wouldn’t that be…</p><p>“The spirit of Abyss Island?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s eyes narrowed. He vaguely remembered that Abyss Island did have a ‘spirit’ in ancient times.</p><p>However, after such a long time, the spirit of Abyss Island had lost its spirituality with the passage of time.</p><p>Apart from the void attendants, there was basically no one who could obtain the favor of the spirit of Abyss Island.</p><p>Jiang Buyi did not expect that he would be the lucky one. Unfortunately, the spirit of Abyss Island was not showing him any goodwill.</p><p>“Exile.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi chewed on this word and seemed to be deep in thought.</p><p>After entering Abyss Island and leaving his name on the Void Suppression Stele, he was advised to “follow the order of Abyss Island”. However, when he asked what the order was, the Void Suppression Stele did not respond, so he did not take it to heart.</p><p>He had never thought that this so-called ‘order’ was actually something he had to experiment with himself!</p><p>“You suddenly gave me two orders because I made a move in the Forest of Miracles and activated the ultimate attribute there? ”</p><p>“Is the last message true or false? If I make another move, the countdown will be reduced?”</p><p>“Exile.”</p><p>“Where else can Abyss Island send me?”</p><p>Soon, Jiang Buyi thought of the Inner Island of Abyss Island, and his face immediately darkened. He could not keep his expression any longer.</p><p>It can’t be, right?</p><p>The Inner Island was truly a land of exile!</p><p>It was said that even demi-saints had no human rights in that place, and even Holy Emperors would be whipped by the order if they were not careful.</p><p>At that time, the fake Bazhun’an of the Forest of Miracles had been intimidating, but Jiang Buyi understood that “exaggeration” was built on the basis of “truth.”</p><p>If he was really exiled to the Inner Island of Abyss Island, it would probably be as the fake Bazhun’an had said. Whether he could come out or not was not the problem. It was a matter of whether he could survive!</p><p>“How can I make up for my mistake?” The mighty demi-saint faced the surrounding void and suddenly shook the Holy Path with his question.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was afraid.</p><p>He did not want to stay on Abyss Island because he had heard of how terrifying it was.</p><p>Now, he had angered the spirit of Abyss Island just by making a move that did not follow the order of the Island.</p><p>To act disobediently again was similar to attacking the air. He wanted to test if his next move would really reduce the countdown. It was a good idea, but Jiang Buyi did not dare to try it.</p><p>What if the countdown really did decrease?</p><p>What if the ten-day countdown ended in an instant and he was banished to the Inner Island by the order without any resistance? What would happen then?</p><p>“Welcome… To Abyss Island… Please strictly follow the order of Abyss Island. Anyone who violates this will be executed!</p><p>At that time, Void Suppression Stele’s intermittent admonishment did not stir his heart at all, but now, it felt extremely terrifying.</p><p>Abyss Island was really following its unknown rules!</p><p>The spirit of Abyss Island had even given him, a sinner of Abyss Island, a 10-day buffer period even if he made a mistake.</p><p>How could he still act disobediently and continue his exploration with such unknown risk where the countdown might end?</p><p>Jiang Buyi pulled a long face as he waited for the spirit of Abyss island’s response.</p><p>He felt that since he was a demi-saint, the other party would give him some dignity.</p><p>However, it didn’t.</p><p>After waiting for a long time, the spirit of Abyss Island did not reply except for the two orders in his mind.</p><p>Jiang Buyi took a deep breath and cleared his throat. Once again, he shook the Holy Path and said with a heavy voice, “I, Jiang Buyi, have no intention of violating the order of Abyss Island. What happened today is just a misunderstanding. I hope the spirit of Abyss Island can give me a clear explanation of how to ‘make up for my mistake’.”</p><p>Looking around, the Way of the Heavens trembled.</p><p>However, even though he had deliberately touched the order of Abybss Island, his words still did not seem to be heard by the spirit of Abyss Island.</p><p>No response!</p><p>“First Hall of Sins.”</p><p>At this moment, footsteps came from the distance, and a hoarse and old voice sounded.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi turned around.</p><p>Since the person could answer, it meant that he had heard everything that he had said to the spirit of Abyss Island. Could it be that this person could deduce his current state, where he is not allowed to make a move?</p><p>“Thud.”</p><p>The footsteps stopped a hundred miles away, and the next step was about to enter the holy realm. However, the person stopped and looked at the invisible line of life and death in front of him silently. He asked softly,</p><p>“Demi-saint Jiang, can I come in?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s voice and expression did not change. He had returned to his calm appearance, but he could see who the person was at a glance.</p><p>Orange robe, orange mask…</p><p>Without a doubt, he was the higher void who had tried to attack him with Huang Quan that day in the deep sea!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
