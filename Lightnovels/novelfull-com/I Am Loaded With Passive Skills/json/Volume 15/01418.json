Let’s stop thinking about it.”</p><p>Upon seeing that the void attendant had finally been fooled, Xu Xiaoshou put the matter aside for the time being.</p><p>He believed that after this round of brainwashing, the big guy in front of him would no longer hold a grudge against him for the little bit of aura he had from the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>After eliminating the last possibility of the void attendant attacking him, Xu Xiaoshou could finally be at ease and boldly carry out the next step of his plan.</p><p>“Countdown to death: 8 days!”</p><p>From the time he had emptied the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer to the time he had come out of the Yuan Mansion, this time bomb had been hanging in his mind.</p><p>No matter what appearance he took on, this thing was always there, and he couldn’t get rid of it.</p><p>It was impossible for him to not panic.</p><p>However, he knew that there was no use panicking. He had to find a way to solve the problem.</p><p>From the limited information he had on Abyss Island, the only solution Xu Xiaoshou could find so far was the “Death Exemption Token” mentioned by the void attendant when he encountered it.</p><p>It was a special item on Abyss Island that could only be exchanged in the ‘First Hall of Sins’.</p><p>And the ‘currency’ they exchanged for was void crystals.</p><p>How did void crystals come about?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know of any other methods. The only method he knew was to get it from a void attendant!</p><p>How?</p><p>He couldn’t just ask for the crystals directly!</p><p>After giving the void attendant in front of him enough time to recover from the previous incident, Xu Xiaoshou patted it on the shoulder and looked up at the sky, his tone a little more sorrowful.</p><p>“Time really flies…”</p><p>“What?” The void attendant looked up, confused.</p><p>“I still remember the scenes of us playing and frolicking together when we were young. Now that I think about it, it’s really a beautiful memory.” Xu Xiaoshou could see the void attendant’s dumbfounded expression from the corner of his eye, but he still sighed.</p><p>“Yeah.” The void attendant nodded, but it was starting to feel confused.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Why did this friend suddenly start to reminisce?</p><p>Right, it still didn’t know the name of its savior. Who was this friend?</p><p>Just as the void attendant was about to speak, it turned around and saw the dreamy expression on the face of an old friend who was immersed in its memories. Words were about to come out of its mouth, but it quickly swallowed them.</p><p>Was it just his imagination?</p><p>Its savior seemed to know it in the past?</p><p>However, it didn’t remember having such a friend.</p><p>When its savior said “when we were young” the void attendant’s heart suddenly skipped a beat. It quickly searched through its memories. It did have playmates when it was young, but it did not remember having this “friend”!</p><p>It can’t be, right?</p><p>Could it be that it had slept too long and forgotten about its old friends?</p><p>“Do you still remember?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly gestured in front of it. It didn’t know what he was gesturing, nor did he specify the time he was referring to. He just smiled and said, “That was so funny, you were actually crying! It was so embarrassing, but fortunately, I was there. Otherwise, I don’t know how you’d be able to walk out of that!”</p><p>The void attendant was stunned.</p><p>“When did I cry?”</p><p>It wanted to ask this question, but for a moment, it did not dare to.</p><p>No matter how stupid the void attendant was, at this time, it would have thought that either it had slept for too long and forgotten some things from when it was young or its savior had the wrong person.</p><p>Its savior…had thought of it as its friend. Was that why it had risked its life to save the void attendant?</p><p>The void attendant really wanted to ask what its savior was talking about, so that it could refresh its childhood memories.</p><p>However, it didn’t dare to!</p><p>It didn’t need to ask to guess the answer to these questions.</p><p>“What? Have you forgotten about me? I risked my life to save you, and you’ve forgotten all the good times we had when we were young?”</p><p>Or perhaps…</p><p>“What? You’re not my friend? I risked my life to save you, and you’re telling me that I’ve recognized the wrong attendant? Then what’s the point of me saving you?”</p><p>How awkward would the situation be then?</p><p>The void attendant was stunned for only three seconds before it found the perfect solution.</p><p>It looked up at the sky and followed its old friend’s gaze. A look of reminiscence appeared on its face, and it said with a myriad of emotions, “Yeah, at that time, it was all thanks to you, my friend,”</p><p>No matter what its old friend said, it would just obey!</p><p>Although this was a misunderstanding, since it was just a beautiful reminiscence, it would let it continue! It should not be resolved!</p><p>(Suspected. Passive Points +1)</p><p>(Acknowledged. Passive Points +1 )</p><p>(Followed. Passive Points +1)</p><p>The other party was speechless.</p><p>The information bar jumped wildly, and Xu Xiaoshou almost burst out laughing, but he forced himself to hold back.</p><p>It was good that it didn’t ask him any more questions.</p><p>There were many ways to get closer to each other, but one would have to ask for more details. As long as it followed his words, the situation won’t be awkward.</p><p>With this, its savior wouldn’t be angry at it for forgetting… Although he wouldn’t dare to.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sorted out his emotions and recovered slightly. He sighed, “That’s right, the past was wonderful. I’ve been asleep for such a long time. However, the moment I’ve just woke up, I almost witnessed your death.”</p><p>“Fortunately, the ripples of the battle of Holy Power could not cover up the connection of our bloodline. I found you at the last moment.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held the void attendant’s hands as he spoke. His eyes were burning and his feelings were sincere. “So many years have passed, and old friends have withered one after another. It’s good that you’re still…here.”.</p><p>The void attendant didn’t even know why it felt so touched. With tears in its eyes, it mumbled, “Yeah…”</p><p>“Let’s not talk about this.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but feel disgusted. He put down the void attendant’s hand and looked away, asking casually, “The thing you’re protecting no longer exists. Where are you going next?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
