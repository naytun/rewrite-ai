He smiled and did not answer.</p><p>“It seems that I’m right.” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man shook his head and sighed.</p><p>“Lord Huang Quan made a guess earlier because no Demi-Saint would come out and prove that his theory was right.”</p><p>“But I’ve unexpectedly witnessed this scene. It turned out that in addition to the must-kill list for those below the Demi-Saint level, the Abyss Island also had an exile list for those at the Demi-Saint level and higher.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi could not hold it in anymore.</p><p>The Yama Organization indeed knew more about the Abyss Island than he did!</p><p>“Exile list.” He inadvertently repeated the two words.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man sized up the person in front of him through the mask and smiled. “You don’t have to pretend, Demi-Saint Jiang. You know your current situation better than I do. As the spirit of the Abyss Island, let me give you a hint. This can’t even be called a ‘hint’. It should be called a ‘threat’.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s cold eyes met his and he suddenly laughed. “Not bad!”</p><p>“Exile, yes, exile!” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man lived up to his expectations and explained, “As its name suggests, it can banish you to the Inner Island of the Abyss Island after a few days. There is no possibility that any exception would be given!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s expression changed, but it quickly returned to normal again.</p><p>“So, how many days do you have left, Demi-Saint Jiang?” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man asked.</p><p>“One year.”</p><p>“That is too much.” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man laughed.</p><p>“Half a year.”</p><p>“I’m afraid you don’t even have a month?” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man said, “I remember that there were only ten days for the must-kill list. The exile list is even shorter than that.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi laughed and waved his hand. “You are indeed smart. I only have half a month left. I must find a way to solve this problem. This is why I stopped to listen to your nonsense.”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man nodded. “That’s good. Let me do a calculation for Demi-Saint Jiang. I wonder what you would do if you only have one day left.”</p><p>“For a Demi-Saint, even if there were only two hours left, he can still turn the Abyss Island upside down if he wanted to.”</p><p>“So, the Spirit of the Abyss Island could still place restrictions on you, right?”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man smiled faintly under the mask.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was too lazy to argue with him and said casually, “You’re very smart. There are indeed restrictions. I can’t use my full power now, as it will consume my lifespan.”</p><p>“Lifespan?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“That’s not exactly true? If I am the Spirit of the Abyss Island and if you attacked me once, the countdown will be reduced by half. If you attacked me three times, you will be sent directly to the Inner Island of the Abyss Island.” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man had a look of scorn in his eyes.</p><p>Jiang Buyi glowered and said gloomily, one word at a time, “Every time you make a move, the countdown will be reduced by two hours. To me, this would mean the end of my lifespan. What do you want to tell me? What cooperation are you after? Stop talking nonsense!”</p><p>“Good. You’re very straightforward, Demi-Saint Jiang. The Five Decays of Heaven and Man laughed. “Then let me give you one more calculation, Demi-Saint Jiang. What if you only had three chances to attack…”</p><p>“There’s no need for ‘what if’.” Jiang Buyi waved his hand and interrupted, “Let’s talk about the cooperation. Tell me the gist of it!”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man suddenly became quiet.</p><p>The scene paused for the length of ten breaths before unbridled laughter rang out.</p><p>“Hahahaha!”</p><p>“It seems that Demi-Saint Jiang is extremely weak now.”</p><p>After a pause, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man calmed down and he asked indifferently, “Are you not going to change your answer to the choice I gave you just now?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi stared at him silently.</p><p>He knew that the person he faced now was a madman!</p><p>Which normal person would dare to threaten a Demi-Saint in this manner? Or was he aware that the Demi-Saint could attack, but had certain restrictions?</p><p>This was no different from seeking death!</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man provoked him repeatedly; he must have a death wish!</p><p>“First Hall of Sins.” Without waiting for Jiang Buyi to ask another question, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man returned to the main topic, “Follow me to the First Hall of Sins and you will survive.”</p><p>Then, he turned around and walked away. “If you wish to understand more, then follow me.”</p><p>“Give me the details!” Jiang Buyi did not move. If he did not understand the other party’s intention, he would seek his own way out and would not follow this madman.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man seemed to be a little impatient, but when he thought that this was a Demi-Saint after all, he stopped in his tracks and said without turning around, “You can only find the Void Crystal in the First Hall of Sins and exchange them for the ‘exemption order’. Other than that, you can either leave the Abyss Island now or die in a few days.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi pondered over the rules of the Abyss Island and asked again, “How about you? Don’t you want to profit by helping me once?”</p><p>“That’s naturally impossible!” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man tilted his head and said gloomily, “Xu Xiaoshou, the one you want to kill will also be at the First Hall of Sins. He is my target.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi was stunned for a moment. “He is already dead.”</p><p>“Hahaha, cough cough…!”</p><p>A burst of wild laughter suddenly came from the front. The laughter was completely uncontrollable, and in the end, it turned into a violent fit of coughing, as if he was about to cough out his heart and lungs.</p><p>Jiang Buyi could only watch the Five Decays of Heaven and Man helplessly, as he laughed crazily in front of him. He laughed so hard that his body was hunched over and the aura of decay overflowed. He laughed so hard that the endless power of misfortune and curses spread out and seemed about to invade his body again.</p><p>“Are you crazy?” He stepped back and asked calmly.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s crazy!” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man returned to his normal state and restrained his momentary loss of control. He said this calmly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
