It bulged and throbbed away.</p><p>His heart!</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s voice was shrill as he vented his anger. He did not care about the sword attack from Mei Siren behind him and Ye Xaotian’s Spatial Confinement.</p><p>He used his hand and exerted force.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The heart that had been pulled out exploded in mid-air, and turned into a bloody mist.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s lips twitched repeatedly, as a sense of perfect relief and satisfaction washed over him after he vented his anger. His laughter echoed into the Nine Heavens.</p><p>“Hahahaha!”</p><p>No one knew how aggrieved he, a dignified Dem-Saint, had felt here!</p><p>He had been used by a junior, and he had made an enemy of the Holy Divine Palace and Teng Shanhai. In the end, a little Sword Deity even came over and managed to destroy one of his Demi-Saint incarnations…</p><p>In the end, he couldn’t even take away the instigator, Xu Xiaoshou, and could only choose to leave in disgrace.</p><p>What a great humiliation that was!</p><p>Jiang Buyi had no intention to leave in such a dejected manner!</p><p>From the moment ‘Bazhun’an’ appeared and made his confession, he had already planned to take Xu Xiaoshou’s life.</p><p>If he didn’t do this, it would be difficult to dispel the hatred in his heart.</p><p>So what if he was the Eighth Sword Deity?</p><p>So what if he was the First-in-command Saint Servant?</p><p>So what if he was the Master of the Black and White Veins?</p><p>Jiang Buyi did not care! He didn’t give two hoots at all!</p><p>The Abyss Island was Bazhun’an’s territory. but if they really wanted revenge, they would have to go to the Northern Region. At that time, it was still unknown who would be the victor.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was not one of those Demi-Saints who hid from the world and did not know their stance.</p><p>He was from the branch of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>After the Lei family’s matter, everyone was in the same boat and there was no distinction between each other.</p><p>Jiang Buyi firmly believed that as long as he personally went to the Saint Mountain to explain to Dao Qiongcang, all the misunderstandings that had occurred and blamed on him could be resolved.</p><p>At that time, if Bazhun’an really wanted to seek revenge, he could even join forces with the Holy Divine Palace and set up a trap in the Northern Region to catch that person and send him to prison.</p><p>However, plans could never match up to changes.</p><p>Even in death, Jiang Buyi did not expect that the Bazhun’an who had rushed over to support him was a fake!</p><p>It was a fake…</p><p>They really dared to play this game!</p><p>He even dared to deceive a Demi-Saint?</p><p>However, the question now was that Jiang Buyi had already planned to eliminate the real Bazhun’an, but the one before him was still a fake. Then, what else in the world was there to be afraid of?</p><p>Jiang Buyi felt glad.</p><p>He was glad that he had not been scared away. Otherwise, when he recalled this matter in the future, wouldn’t he be extremely angry, and by then it would be too late for regrets?</p><p>When he looked back…</p><p>No matter how the battle ended, Jiang Buyi had left the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree.</p><p>Was it worth it to give up this Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree, which was even more precious than the Demi-Saint’s incarnation, just to kill Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Jiang Buyi felt that it was worth it!</p><p>In life, there was nothing more satisfying than to settle enmities.</p><p>He was already a Demi-Saint, wouldn’t he be like the infinite villain if he had to be extra cautious and worry about gains and losses when he wanted to kill a person?</p><p>He wouldn’t get any material benefits if he killed Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>However, Jiang Buyi felt that his idea was awesome and how could that not feel good?</p><p>In the end, everything that happened to him was because of this junior!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was the main culprit!</p><p>As long as he did not die, Jiang Buyi would never be happy!</p><p>“Go and reincarnate, ignorant junior.”</p><p>“In your next life, remember not to offend people you shouldn’t offend!”</p><p>Without any pause, he crushed Xu Xiaoshou’s heart. The remaining Holy Power of the Demi-Saint poured into Xu Xiaoshou’s body and turned into the ‘Holy Light of Saints’ that could melt everything in Teng Shanhai’s body.</p><p>Under the glow of the Holy Light, a halo appeared between Heaven and Earth.</p><p>Inside the halo, Xu Xiaoshou’s face was filled with tears of regret and a perpetual frozen expression of fear.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>There was no suspense at all.</p><p>His body disappeared, his soul had been erased, and even his will had been destroyed by the Demi-Saint’s Power!</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The cries of the Void Attendant outside the Arena turned into one of agony. Just like Ye Xiaotian and the others, it could not accept this scene before its eyes.</p><p>He was a good human boy and full of energy from the Void Attendant’s aesthetic point of view, but at this moment, all traces of his existence in the human world had been wiped away, and he had died an unnatural death.</p><p>If the Void Attendant was already in such a state, what more for Ye Xiaotian and the others, who had closer ties with Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Mei Siren’s sword was ultimately too slow.</p><p>Perhaps it was because Jiang Buyi said so much nonsense before he left that he managed to successfully divert their attention.</p><p>Perhaps it was because no one would have thought that Jiang Buyi would leave the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree, which was regarded as a treasure by a Demi-Saint, to take away Xu Xiaoshou’s life.</p><p>People thought about problems from the perspective of receipt of benefits. Sometimes, they would forget that there were some people who did certain things and did not care about the gains and losses at all; they did it to justify their thoughts.</p><p>It sounded ridiculous, but it made sense.</p><p>Those who cultivate the Path, did they cultivate their hearts?</p><p>As for heart cultivators, which one of them could accept the slightest bit of restraint on their minds and spirits?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stood in Jiang Buyi’s way, and Jiang Buyi had wiped him out. Even if he had to pay a great price, it would still make sense.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
