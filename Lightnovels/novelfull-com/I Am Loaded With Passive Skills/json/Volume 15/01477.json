Just when she was about to rush out of this Fantasy Realm, she was blocked by an obstacle that fell from the sky.</p><p>Just one step!</p><p>Just one more step!</p><p>However, this man with squinty eyes reacted in just a few short breaths and appeared in front of her.</p><p>Ghost Granny had almost completely torn this monster with squinty eyes apart in her heart.</p><p>She had even abandoned her physical body and used the ‘body-eating soul escape technique’!</p><p>This was a high-level escape technique that drained one’s body strength in exchange for a burst of spiritual power for a period of time. It was used to retreat from enemies or as a means of escape.</p><p>After using it, regardless whether it was successful or not, the previous body could no longer be used.</p><p>Apart from taking possession of another body and creating another body, Ghost Granny would only have one soul body left for a long time.</p><p>However, Xiao Kongtong was not willing to let her go!</p><p>“You’re shouting my name out so loudly. Do you have something special to tell me?”</p><p>Under the moonlit night, two small, dark swords appeared in the pupils of Xiao Kongtong’s squinty eyes.</p><p>This was a simple Spirits Controlling technique. With this sword technique, he could clearly see Ghost Granny’s soul body and he knew what her next move would be.</p><p>Unless you were a Spiritual Cultivator who had mastered the spiritual technique or an Ancient Swordsman who practiced the Spirits Controlling, it was very difficult to cross the two Heavens of Yin and Yang and see a person’s soul body with the naked eye.</p><p>This was the ‘weird effect’ that most Spiritual Cultivators who cultivated their minds and souls wanted to achieve most.</p><p>Because as long as one did not specifically cultivate this path, even if an ordinary person was in the higher void level, he would probably be helpless against any spiritual attacks – he could not even see!</p><p>But obviously, Xiao Kongtong was not one of them.</p><p>“Give me a chance!” Ghost Granny’s contorted face showed an intense struggle. Finally, her voice weakened and she begged him pitifully.</p><p>“I’ve given you a chance. As long as you had the ability to get out of my Fantasy Sword Technique, there was a high probability that I won’t pursue you. After all, as the old saying goes, don’t go after a cornered enemy.” Xiao Kongtong sighed.</p><p>He was telling the truth.</p><p>Firstly, Xiao Kongtong despised Elder Xie and Ghost Granny. He thought they had someone who backed them up. However, it turned out that they did not. If there were, they would have appeared long ago.</p><p>Secondly, he had held them back because he wanted to protect Xu Xiaoshou. If he had fallen for the enemy’s trick to ‘lure the tiger out of the mountain’, he was afraid that his Teacher would hold him responsible later. However, the facts had also proved that the appearance of these two great assassins was not a trick at all; they were merely reckless.</p><p>“There is no enmity between us, and I never harbored any intention to hurt you. If you let me off today, I will definitely repay you in the future.” Ghost Granny said miserably. She looked at the night sky and the moon and her heart filled with sorrow.</p><p>“Can you hurt me?” Xiao Kongtong asked calmly.</p><p>Ghost Granny’s soul body trembled, and she closed her eyes helplessly.</p><p>Only the heavens knew how much time she had wasted in the Fantasy Realm when she followed Elder Xie and ran around aimlessly.</p><p>She had thought that Elder Xie who had used the Strange Sect’s Evil Technique and the Cursed Yin Eye would be able to help her break free from the restraints and return to the sea.</p><p>She didn’t expect a terrifying aura to erupt from the next street, and only then did Ghost Granny realize that something was wrong.</p><p>After this test, as expected, Elder Xie’s abilities were fake, a virtual one, and Elder Xie himself was also Xiao Kongtong in disguise!</p><p>She had been bewitched!</p><p>If she was not mistaken, the energy fluctuations that came from the neighboring street meant that Elder Xie had met with a mishap. It was very likely that he had already died.</p><p>The higher void level…</p><p>They even managed to surpass the terror of the Blood World.</p><p>They had never thought that they would die at the hands of another higher void level on this Abyss Island.</p><p>If she really died in the battle, then so be it. However, Ghost Granny knew very well that even if she exhausted all her means, she probably would not be able to harm a single hair on Xiao Kongtong’s head.</p><p>After all, she had already used all her trump cards, but she had not even mastered the most basic of the Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>Was the difference between people really that great?</p><p>We are all from the higher void level.</p><p>The more she thought about it, the angrier she got. The more she panicked, the angrier she became. Ghost Granny’s soul body, which was on the verge of a mental breakdown, suddenly emitted a vast soul power which turned her into a huge monster. She roared in rage.</p><p>“Xiao Kongtong, you won’t let me go today. Even if I die, I’ll tear off a piece of your flesh. I’d rather die than live in dishonor!”</p><p>The angry voice of the soul power reverberated up to the Nine Heavens. Xiao Kongtong felt a sharp pain in his head.</p><p>However, when the two small dark swords in his eyes enlarged slightly, a soul barrier formed by the Sword Will blocked the damage to his body.</p><p>He laughed and scanned Ghost Granny’s soul body that was about to go crazy. He said calmly, “Do you really think that you’re a piece of jade?”</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Ghost Granny’s soul body instantly turned crimson red, and the soul power around her also turned violent, as if she had used some kind of secret technique. Like a trapped beast, she charged at Xiao Kongtong with all her might.</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was unmoved; he did not even bother to use his sword.</p><p>It was only when the soul power was about to reach him, when Ghost Granny’s terrifying and ugly face was completely enlarged in his pupils, and almost touched his face, that he slowly raised a finger.</p><p>“Sure, I’ll give you one last chance.”</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>The violent red soul power that filled the Nine Heavens was instantly contained. Ghost Granny’s forward momentum seemed to freeze as if a pause button had been pressed and immediately stopped, in the night.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
