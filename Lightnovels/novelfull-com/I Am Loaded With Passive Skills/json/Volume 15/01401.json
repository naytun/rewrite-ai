In fact, that place’s reaction was even more exaggerated than the Forest of Miracles, seeing that it had sent so many giants to kill him.</p><p>“Bazhuan’an…” Jiang Buyi’s body turned into a calamity cloud of thunder and fire. Thus his expression could not be seen clearly. However, when he said this name, he was somewhat fearful.</p><p>The Seven Sword Deity, Mei Siren, was already so strong.</p><p>In the past, he didn’t care much about the legend of the “the Master of the black and white veins”, but could it be true?</p><p>At this moment, the stone giants finally settled down.</p><p>In the space that was broken from the stomps, an insignificant black void attendant ran into the unremarkable place.</p><p>In comparison, this little guy was very different.</p><p>As soon as it entered the field, it did not hide in the back like the stone monsters. Instead, it boldly ignored the anxious atmosphere in the arena, then ran to help its companion, another void attendant, up. Following this, the two attendants ran back together and blended in with the group of stone giants. They also put their hands on their hips and started roaring… They were like dogs that had finally got a master after being bullied for a long time.</p><p>Jiang Buyi did not think much of it.</p><p>He only focused on three things: Mei Siren, Bazhun’an, and the disappeared Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>These stone giants looked big, but just like the void attendant he had fought before, they were simply useless!</p><p>Jiang Buyi was not even willing to allot any extra energy, strength, or attention to the stone giants and the void attendants.</p><p>After all, why should he help to clean up the sh*t that Bazhun’an had created?</p><p>So many faults had been wrongfully blamed on him, and he had not removed any of them yet!</p><p>The demi-saint’s face had turned into a calamity cloud of thunder and fire, and his gaze was locked on the uninvited guest on the Demon God’s great spear.</p><p>“Bazhun’an…” Jiang Buyi said coldly, his voice ethereal, “You, what do you mean?”</p><p>On the Demon God’s great spear, Xiao Kongtong covered his mouth and nose, coughed weakly a few times, then raised his head to face him with a smile.</p><p>“I naturally don’t have any other intentions. I’m not here for Xu Xiaoshou, and I don’t need you to help me deal with these big troubles behind me either. It’s just that I saw two pillars of the Shengshen Continent fighting here. I couldn’t bear to see one of you die, so I came here to mediate,” As he said this, he turned to look at Mei Siren.</p><p>He nodded slightly to show his respect but did not bow. He only asked softly, “Master Siren, can you stop this battle on my behalf?”</p><p>Mei Siren was silent.</p><p>He had long noticed this person.</p><p>Back in the middle of the battle, the two had carried spatial barriers and advanced against the shockwaves of the battlefield. He believed that Jiang Buyi also knew that they had sneaked here.</p><p>However… What was Bazhun’an doing here?</p><p>Didn’t he say that everything related to Xu Xiaoshou on Abyss Island would be left to him, Mei Siren?</p><p>And… Why was Bazhun’an, this brat, in this getup now? The other party was so different from what he had seen at Si River.</p><p>Bazhun’an’s aura and appearance were the same, but he was a lot more unkempt. He was also carrying a sack… Was it an illusion? He didn’t seem to have seen this sack before…</p><p>Mei Siren waved his folding fan and held back his doubts. He didn’t think too much about it and simply said, “I’ve long intended to stop the battle. You should be asking Demi-Saint Jiang above.”</p><p>“If Master Siren is willing, that is naturally the best.” Xiao Kongtong nodded at him, then looked up, and his aura suddenly turned cold. “Jiang Buyi, to be honest, I don’t really want to let you leave!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s entire body tensed up at his words, and even Mei Siren furrowed his brows slightly.</p><p>The calamity clouds of thunder and fire in the Nine Heavens immediately froze and stopped changing for a while. It was as if the person was highly alert, guarding against the great horror that was about to come.</p><p>After a moment of solemness, Xiao Kongtong laughed. “You laid a hand on my people, so I really want to make you pay, but unfortunately, I can’t.”</p><p>He stopped smiling and looked up into the sky with a serious expression, then said loudly, “Jiang Buyi, I believe you have also seen the changes in the Forest of Miracles caused by this battle…”</p><p>After the great battle, this place could no longer be called a “forest”. It was more like a “ruin”.</p><p>“I’ve already made a move to Sleeping Valley. As for the First Hall of Sins, this friend of mine has also made a move,” He pointed at Ye Xiaotian with a smile, and the latter’s face darkened immediately, “Two of the nine extreme grounds have already awakened. In addition, there’s also the Forest of Miracles here…”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong didn’t have the slightest intention of joking as he said in a deep voice, “Jiang Buyi, you won’t want to know what kind of danger it will bring to everyone on Abyss Island when all nine ultimate attributes are activated and three of the extreme grounds are awakened as well as fully formed.”</p><p>“You also won’t want to know why there are only creatures weaker than the demi-saints on the Outer Island of Abyss Island like the void attendants and stone giants… You may wonder where the Saint Stage existences have gone…”</p><p>“What’s more, you won’t want to know the real difference between the Inner and Outer Islands. If you were to be sucked into the third of the nine extreme grounds and fall into the Inner Island, what kind of complicated process would you need to go through to…” Xiao Kongtong dragged out the last syllable.</p><p>At this moment, Mei Siren was silent, and his expression had become serious.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian, on the other hand, could no longer tell whether the fellow in front of him was Xiao Kongtong acting as Bazhun’an or the other way around.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
