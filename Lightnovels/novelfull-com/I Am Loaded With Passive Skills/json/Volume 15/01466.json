Devil Sword Technique! (Part 2)</p><p>“Teacher…” Xiao Kongtong’s first reaction was to ask who his teacher was, but then he realized that with such a talent, it was impossible for Master Siren not to accept him on the spot.</p><p>D*mn it, what did he miss!</p><p>At this moment, Xiao Kongtong only wanted to give the two higher void-level disciples a vicious sword strike to make up for the opportunity to witness the historical scene of a major record being broken after being lured away.</p><p>But soon, when he looked back at Master Siren’s face, he also focused on the real point of Xu Xiaoshou’s words.</p><p>“I don’t know if it’s considered a chaos form.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong repeated the words and looked at Master Siren in a daze. There was a bit of horror in his tone.</p><p>“Master Siren, don’t tell me that Xu Xiaoshou means that he has skipped the chaos form and directly visualized the complete ‘Present Gods and Buddhas’?”</p><p>At first, Xiao Kongtong thought that what Xu Xiaoshou visualized was the Present Gods and Buddhas that was not even as good as the chaos form.</p><p>Later on, he thought about it again. With that kid’s attitude, it was clear that he wanted to give him a big scare. In that case, it might really be as he guessed.</p><p>However, this story was too shocking!</p><p>Mei Siren closed his paper fan, and the scene of his cultivation deviation in Xu Xiaoshou’s spiritual world flashed in his mind. Besides the imagery of the sword body Gu Louying, the interior world was still primitive and chaotic, full of doomsday disasters and endless devilish energy.</p><p>“I’m not sure.” He hesitated but gave an ambiguous answer.</p><p>He thought that Xu Xiaoshou’s Present Gods and Buddhas had been fully formed. Except for the Sword God’s imagery, his spiritual world was a mess.</p><p>Even if Xu Xiaoshou’s Present Gods and Buddhas hadn’t formed yet, he had visualized the Sword God’s image. Even he himself was caught off guard and almost lost in it.</p><p>Was this considered a complete form, or was it a chaos form?</p><p>For a moment, Mei Siren could not figure it out.</p><p>The former was better.</p><p>If it was really the latter…</p><p>Mei Siren’s Adam’s apple bobbed unconsciously. For the first time, he felt that his knowledge was limited. It seemed that all the standard answers would become unknown if they were applied to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Even you don’t know?” Xiao Kongtong was dumbfounded. The shock he felt when he saw the power of the evil god being displayed by Elder Xie was far less than the shock Master Siren gave him when he heard Master Siren’s answer.</p><p>He turned his head and looked back at Xu Xiaoshou, as if he was sizing up a monster that had appeared out of nowhere. In the end, his lips moved a few times, but he could not ask any more questions.</p><p>Perhaps, no matter how many questions he asked, he would not be able to explain his doubts. He might as well ask Xu Xiaoshou to take action and see. Xiao Kongtong had not forgotten what Master Siren had said to him before he took action.</p><p>“Don’t let a single one go!”</p><p>This was partly because of Master Siren’s anger towards the two higher void cultivators, and also because he wanted to use them as whetstones for Xu Xiaoshou’s sword.</p><p>What Xiao Kongtong didn’t expect was that Xu Xiaoshou had used raw material to make a sword, and it had only taken him 30 minutes!</p><p>That was insane!</p><p>After some thought, he pointed at the two higher void cultivators who were still trapped in the long street and said something similar to what the old Sword Deity, Mei Siren, said.</p><p>“Go on.”</p><p>“I’ve trapped them and worn out some of their fighting strength. Next, it’s your turn to test your sword.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded slightly and looked down at the long street. He saw the monsters that were scattered into a black-purple sea, and on the other side, an old woman sprinting back and forth in a few streets.</p><p>He had already beaten them into a pulp and played with them until they were in a piteous state, yet he only said that he had worn down a little of their combat power.</p><p>Ancient swordsmen were indeed very humble people.</p><p>Restraining his thoughts of ridiculing them, Xu Xiaoshou understood that this was the result of the world of Fantasy Sword Technique created by Xiao Kongtong, which had crushed the two higher void levels.</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could understand the old woman charging back and forth, but he was baffled by the black and purple sea. He could feel a heart-palpitating power from it, which seemed to be of a high level.</p><p>“That’s the power of the evil god.” Xiao Kongtong became more serious. He turned his head to look at Master Siren, wanting to find out what the problem was.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also turned his head.</p><p>Mei Siren’s eyes narrowed slightly, and his tone became a little heavy. “Indeed, it’s the aura of the power of the ancestral source.”</p><p>The power of the ancestral source!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>What’s the big deal about this? Leaving a monster that has mastered the power of the ancestral source and letting him fight it?</p><p>He had just mastered the Heart Sword Technique, Present Gods and Buddhas, but he was still essentially just a Master Stage cultivator.</p><p>Were those guys crazed?</p><p>How could they let him test his sword like this?</p><p>“It’s just the aura.” Mei Siren sensed Xu Xiaoshou’s mood and smiled. “Compared to the time in the Forest of Miracles, the remaining power fluctuations of Teng Shanhai that you mentioned are many times weaker. I think this is the power that the higher void borrowed randomly. It can not be considered the true power of the ancestral source.”</p><p>“Then he should still be very strong.” The first reaction of Xu Xiaoshou was to retreat. After all, it was for the sake of safety. Then, he recalled Water Ghost’s words.</p><p>It was a risk but also an opportunity!</p><p>Having mastered the Heart Sword Technique and the Present Gods and Buddhas meant that he was now a true Sovereign of the Way of the Sword.</p><p>As for the Sovereign Stage, it involved the Struggle for the Great Path.</p><p>In the Struggle for the Great Path, one would either advance or retreat.</p><p>With the protection of Xiao Kongtong and Master Siren, how could there be an accident when he went down?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou understood this point and pulled out the stone sword. After thinking for a while, he put the stone sword back in place again, afraid that it would be damaged. Then, he pulled out the Fourth Sword and the Flame Python and said with a serious face.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
