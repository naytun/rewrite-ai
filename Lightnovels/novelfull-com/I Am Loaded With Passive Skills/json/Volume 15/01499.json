Fight! Hmm? Cough, cough!”</p><p>The melodious battle song was like a game. Not only did it make Mei Siren red in the face and embarrassed to be in the same group as this disciple, but it also made Ghost Granny’s mentality explode. She was so angry that she wanted to rush to Xu Xiaoshou and tear his big mouth apart.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou was playing around, but void general Hong was not.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>With a hoarse and deep roar, void general Hong tightened its grip on the two-handed sword. As the spiritual light flashed, he was only half an inch away from pulling the sword out of his chest.</p><p>“Dammit! You should die!”</p><p>Ghost Granny’s eyes were about to pop out of their sockets, but her soul body was being suppressed by the opposing spirit soul, and she couldn’t even take out the most basic Spiritual Banner, let alone any other effective defensive measures.</p><p>At this critical moment, Ghost Granny sharply noticed that void general Hong’s sword-drawing action had come to an abrupt stop, as if it was restricted by something or some kind of rule. The sword couldn’t move an inch.</p><p>“It can’t be pulled out!”</p><p>Ghost Granny was ecstatic. She was trying her best to suppress the spiritual power that had been forced back into her body by the void general. She was about to ignite it completely and launch a counterattack.</p><p>But at this moment, void general Hong seemed to have gained enough power after pulling out the two-handed sword partially.</p><p>It was no longer obsessed with the action of pulling out the sword. The hands that were holding the hilt of the big sword slipped and suddenly slashed into the night sky.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>A dragon’s roar suddenly sounded.</p><p>Void general Hong couldn’t pull out the solid two-handed sword.</p><p>However, in one move, the power of thousands of spiritual lights and Demi-saint’s Power in his hands turned into an illusory and transparent dark sword.</p><p>The sword light tore the sky apart, splitting the darkness.</p><p>“Impossible!” The wailing in Ghost Granny’s heart finally stopped under this sword.</p><p>“Boom!” There was a spatial dislocation.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was behind, was stunned by the sword that could split space and time.</p><p>From the distorted space, he could still see Ghost Granny’s twisted face and the expression of despair that had frozen at the last moment.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>Time, space, and all sorts of laws were all cut off by this Supreme Sword.</p><p>Ghost Granny who was in front of void general Hong couldn’t even use half of her defensive spiritual techniques. Her soul body was split into two on the spot.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>Void general Hong sheathed its sword and stood still. Thousands of spiritual lights returned and poured into its body. The two-handed sword in front of its chest also fell back inch by inch until the hilt and handguards were stuck in front of his blood-red armor, making a “crack” sound.</p><p>“It’s over?</p><p>“She’s dead?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded. He couldn’t believe that it was over.</p><p>Isn’t Hong a little too strong? Ghost Granny, who also cultivated the Dao of the soul, couldn’t even defend herself against its suppression, let alone launch a counterattack.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>At this moment, a ray of spiritual light shot out from Ghost Granny’s soul body that had been split into two, heading straight for the sky.</p><p>“Good move!”</p><p>Mei Siren reacted quickly and immediately gazed at it. He was surprised that after Ghost Granny had shed her golden cicada shell and abandoned her physical body, she could still use the golden cicada shell to abandon her soul body.</p><p>However, what else could this remaining bit of spiritual light do other than run for her life?</p><p>Even if she was given thirty to fifty years, Ghost Granny would not be able to recover even half of her original cultivation!</p><p>Void general Hong’s sword had actually forced her to cut off her own Dao Foundation in order to survive with a little bit of spiritual light so that she could be resurrected in the future. It was truly terrifying!</p><p>“Do you want to let her live?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong also looked at the spiritual light disappearing into the horizon. After taking a step, she saw Master Siren’s reaction and stopped.</p><p>In fact, he had been maintaining the fantasy realm of the Fantasy Sword Technique time and time again, for fear that the fluctuations of the battle here would be seen by someone. After all, there were demi-saints on Abyss Island.</p><p>However, void general Hong’s explosion was too powerful!</p><p>The absolute power had shattered his fantasy realm time and time again. At this moment, Ghost Granny had borrowed the void general Hong’s sword to escape. It had to be said that it was an extremely wise and only choice.</p><p>It was possible to let her live.</p><p>This was because when the fantasy realm was destroyed once again, Xiao Kongtong had already predicted that Ghost Granny’s only option was to escape.</p><p>However, he looked at Master Siren and then at void general Hong in front of Xu Xiaoshou. He felt that there was no need to do so.</p><p>“It’s up to him,” Mei Siren didn’t say much, only looking at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>On the long street, Xu Xiaoshou was getting anxious.</p><p>There was no way he would let a gold-hunting token assassin who was coveting his head live.</p><p>No one knew better than him how terrifying a person who could survive in such a situation would be!</p><p>Ghost Granny had escaped from a great disaster and might encounter a lucky chance on Abyss Island, becoming a demi-saint. Or she could possess a genius, rise up again, and come back in the future.</p><p>In short, just like how he had never cultivated step by step to his current realm, Xu Xiaoshou did not believe that if a higher void expert could escape, he would need a lot of time to recover his foundational roots, or even never recover in his entire life.</p><p>He was a pessimist.</p><p>He felt that all the geniuses in this world had the growth trajectory of the son of the heavens.</p><p>Even if Ghost Granny wasn’t Bazhun’an or Master Siren, or a world-famous genius like Yu Lingdi, what if her rise was after being humiliated by him today?</p><p>“Hong, go after her! We can’t let her escape!”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou even wanted to use the Red Ghost Inscription’s power to give void general Hong the most direct order.</p><p>However, before he could do so, void general Hong actually lowered its head and pointed heavily at him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
