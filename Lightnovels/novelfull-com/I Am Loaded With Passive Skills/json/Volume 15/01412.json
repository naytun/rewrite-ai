Does it know what it’s doing now? Did it draw its happiness from the pain of humans?”</p><p>Mei Siren hesitated for only half a breath of time. In the next second, he pulled out the stone sword from his back.</p><p>No matter what, he couldn’t tolerate a Void Attendant who dared mock him at this time, especially when Xu Xiaoshou had just died and everyone was so disheartened.</p><p>The Saint Calamity was too slow.</p><p>He wanted to directly kill this Void Attendant that tried to seek its own death before he started to transcend the tribulation.</p><p>“You came at the wrong time.” Mei Siren moved his sword.</p><p>However, at this moment.</p><p>“Beep…beep…beep…”</p><p>The faint sounds of the Communication Talisman could be heard. If he had not listened carefully, he would have missed it.</p><p>Mei Siren’s sword paused, and a stunned expression appeared on his face. He realized that this ‘beep’ sound seemed to be not from his own body, but from a second overlapping sound.</p><p>“Where was it?”</p><p>Mei Siren looked around and was shocked to find that the Void Attendant in front of him had bent down and showed its big face. In its slightly open stinky mouth, there was another small Communication Talisman around its tongue.</p><p>“Hee…”</p><p>???</p><p>At this moment, Mei Siren’s mind went blank.</p><p>That was impossible!</p><p>Absolutely impossible!</p><p>“How did the Void Attendant get hold of Xu Xiaoshou’s Communication Talisman?”</p><p>“Could it be that he had been robbed by this Void Attendant before he died in the hands of Jiang Buyi?”</p><p>Or perhaps…</p><p>“Too stupid! What was I thinking of?”</p><p>“Other than the speculation of ‘being robbed’, what else could it be?”</p><p>Mei Siren grabbed the stone sword and clutched his head. He was already dumbfounded. Even the major event of the Saint Calamity had been pushed back by him subconsciously. The Calamity Cloud in the Nine Heavens was about to disperse.</p><p>“It’s a little messy, think again…”</p><p>“Die now!”</p><p>Behind them, Xiao Kongtong could no longer hold back.</p><p>How dare this stupid Void Attendant provoke them? How dare it!</p><p>After he regained a little of his strength after he took Ye Xiaotian’s Elixirs, he immediately condensed a sword in the air and was about to slash at it.</p><p>“Hold on!”</p><p>Mei Siren reached out to stop the impulsive Xiao Kongtong. He was about to believe the impossible possibility in his mind.</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong had been stopped. Ye Xiaotian could no longer hold back his temper, and a Power Upanishad Formation immediately spread out under his feet.</p><p>They had been chased by the Stone Giants for a long time, and Xu Xiaoshou had just died in front of them. The anger in their hearts had not yet been vented. Why did this fellow from the giant race still want to jump out and provoke the three of them?</p><p>Even though he was not as powerful as the two men beside him, Ye Xiaotian could not stand it any longer.</p><p>He grabbed at the air with one hand and was about to gather it in. The group damage skill had become a single target attack, and he was about to use the ‘Disintegrate’ skill on the big guy in front of him.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Mei Siren panicked. With a shake of his stone sword, the space around him was completely suppressed, and Ye Xiaotian was unable to unleash his skills.</p><p>“?”</p><p>“?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong and Ye Xiaotian, whose attacks had been suppressed, turned to look at Master Siren, with question marks marked on their foreheads.</p><p>“I’m…Mei Siren started to speak, but for a moment, he did not know how to explain.</p><p>“Roar!” The Void attendant called out in a low voice and did not say anything else. Instead, he slowly extended one of his legs and timidly fumbled around in front of Ye Xiaotian.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was speechless.</p><p>This strange movement…</p><p>Although it was a little distasteful yet comical, it instantly made him think of the stupid scene where Xu Xiaoshou stretched out his leg to steal the ring under his nose when he had just left the Tianxuan Gate at the Tiansang Spirit Palace!</p><p>“You’re…?” Ye Xiaotian’s eyes widened in shock.</p><p>The Void Attendant retracted its leg and squinted at him. It moved closer and spoke intermittently in the human language…</p><p>“Who were you crying for?”</p><p>The atmosphere froze at that moment.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s eyes lit up as if he had been struck by lightning. There were still traces of tears on his face.</p><p>In the next second, the face of this Elder turned red. He raised his fingers and trembled, unable to say a word.</p><p>“What happened?” Xiao Kongtong was dumbfounded.</p><p>“Why did this Void Attendant behave as if it knew everyone?”</p><p>Moreover, Ye Xiaotian seemed to have understood something from its actions.</p><p>Before he could calm down and observe more, the Void Attendant turned and looked at him.</p><p>The giant didn’t say much either. He stretched out two huge fingers and gently put them together. Then, he drew a line in the air and made a ’10 Sections of the Finger Sword’ gesture!</p><p>What a joke!</p><p>How could a Void Attendant know all these fancy things?</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was speechless.</p><p>“You…you…you…”</p><p>The eloquent speaker from Fringe Moon Immortal City immediately evolved into Fringe Moon Immortal City’s big stutterer. His eyes were filled with shock, and he seemed to have understood something.</p><p>“Your… imitation… of the spell…was so crude,” the Void Attendant uttered intermittently.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s face turned green instantly.</p><p>“Did it just mock the teacher he imitated for his poor acting skills?”</p><p>“Just now, I managed to fool Jiang Buyi; it was good that the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree did not appear!</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s heart roared madly.</p><p>Mei Siren gazed blankly at this dramatic scene in front of him. He took a few deep breaths in a row, but still could not suppress the shock in his heart.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
