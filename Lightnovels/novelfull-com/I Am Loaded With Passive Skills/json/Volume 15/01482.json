Everyone has the desire to learn.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held his head and wiped away his tears. He thought to himself, “Teacher, you’ve never seen Elder Qiao. Are you looking down on…can you not hear my head of the Four Disciples of the Holy Palace, Elder Qiao’s laughter?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong clutched his head and finally suppressed his joy. He shook his head and laughed, “Granny, can you give us Ancient Swordsman some face? The ‘Phantom Swords Technique isn’t that easy to practice.”</p><p>“How did Xu Xiaoshou do it in one step? Ghost Granny pursed her lips and looked away.</p><p>“The second step!”</p><p>Mei Siren’s words pulled everyone back to the main topic.</p><p>When he saw the students looking at him, he restrained the Sword Will in his body and deliberately manifested it. He turned it into visible air ripples and gathered them in his eyes.</p><p>In an instant, the pupils of Mei Siren’s eyes were enlarged, and two small dark swords condensed by the Sword Will appeared in them.</p><p>Then, he coldly swept his gaze over the area. The dim light emitted by the small swords in his pupils shone on the ‘spirit’ he had summoned earlier.</p><p>“The Sword Will returns to the body and the windows of the heart are open. It’s similar to the Heart Sword Technique, but it doesn’t focus on the spiritual level, but on the soul level. It opens the ‘ghost sign’ in the eyes and controls the ‘spirit’ of all things.”</p><p>‘Ghost sign’ was a brand new term… Xu Xiaoshou’s mind stirred and he quickly found a similar experience in his knowledge base.</p><p>“The feeling of searching for the ‘spirit’ in All Things are Swords is the feeling of focusing your attention on the soul level.”</p><p>“When you use this feeling to restrain the Sword Will in the pupil, the Intangible will turn into a shape, and conjure up the two small dark swords; this is the ‘ghost sign’.”</p><p>“The ‘ghost sign’ is equivalent to the power of the spiritual master of the Heart Sword Technique in the Present Gods and Buddhas. It should be called Lord of Souls now? Hmm, strictly speaking, it should be an order from the Lord of Souls that can enslave the souls of all living things.”</p><p>On one side, he was still searching for the memories in the knowledge library. On the other side, Ghost Granny who was like the three good students, was also secretly taking all this in seriously.</p><p>Ghost sign…</p><p>Ghost Granny didn’t understand the first part of the sentence.</p><p>But after that, she thought, “Isn’t this a ‘soul seal’?”</p><p>When she enslaved the ghost spirits, she had to use the ‘soul seal’ method to become the master of these ghost spirits before she could issue any orders.</p><p>There were also two small, dark swords in Xiao Kongtong’s eyes. Was this another interpretation of ‘soul seal’ by the Ancient Swordsman?</p><p>Ghost Granny didn’t need to practice this move at all. She already knew it. She immediately turned to look at Xu Xiaoshou with a slight sneer on her lips.</p><p>It was different from the feeling of searching for a spirit. To condense a ‘soul seal’ really required a lot of skill and experience!</p><p>Back then, she didn’t have a teacher, so she studied the cultivation method of the way of the soul alone.</p><p>It took half a year just to find the feeling of condensing the ‘soul seal’- this was even more difficult than this novice’s first Spiritual Cultivation when she tried to find the spiritual energy between her meridians!</p><p>Ghost Granny had spent a few days and managed to successfully condense the first ‘soul seal’. This was already considered as being very talented.</p><p>However, at the beginning, the ‘soul seal’ could only enslave spirits such as chickens and ducks that could not put up a resistance. By the time the ‘soul seal’ grew to the point where it could enslave large-scale spirits that could be used in battle, it was already more than half a year later.</p><p>Mei Siren had a similar thought.</p><p>He didn’t have any extraordinary talent in the cultivation of the Phantom Swords Technique and was considered only average.</p><p>Therefore, based on his experience, he knew that the ‘Ghost sign’ might be a little difficult for a beginner to understand the concept of the Phantom Sword Technique. He had just finished his sentence and was about to explain further.</p><p>Who would have thought that after Xu Xiaoshou had culled through the knowledge in his mind, he had already made his move.</p><p>“Is this how you do it?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
