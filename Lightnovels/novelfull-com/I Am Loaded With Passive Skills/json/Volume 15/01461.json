(Part 2)</p><p>“Did I hear anything else?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered to himself for a while.</p><p>Mei Siren’s heart beat faster for some reason.</p><p>“There was something!”</p><p>“There was something?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Then what did you hear?” Mei Siren was nervous, and his hand that was holding the stone sword was sweating unconsciously.</p><p>Can this really be said? Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his chin and raised his eyes to glance at Master Siren, but he quickly looked away.</p><p>After a long moment of silence, he felt that he could not let go of this great opportunity. In the end, he risked his life and said, “I’ve heard some secrets that can’t be told,”</p><p>“Speak!” Mei Siren said in a heavy voice, his expression already a little more solemn.</p><p>“Please promise not to kill me first.” Xu Xiaoshou was so scared that he took a step back. “No, you must promise not to hurt me.”</p><p>“This old man told you to speak, so you just speak!” Mei Siren did not make any guarantees. His expression was very gloomy, but it quickly became calm again. He smiled and said, “It’s alright. Just describe it casually. I won’t be angry.”</p><p>“You promise?”</p><p>“Yes, I promise!”</p><p>As soon as his voice fell, Xu Xiaoshou jumped back with a big step and raised the stone sword in his hand high.</p><p>Under the elderly Sword Deity’s confused gaze, he took another big step forward and thrust the stone sword in his hand forward. He adopted an extremely embarrassing posture and shouted in a very brazen manner.</p><p>“You Tu, endure my sword!”</p><p>Mei Siren was speechless.</p><p>The corners of his eyes twitched, and his entire old face immediately turned green, then red. He clenched his molars so hard that the faint sound of grinding teeth could be heard.</p><p>“Hey, hey, hey, hey!” Xu Xiaoshou was so scared that he immediately put away his sword. “Master Siren, you asked me to tell you. You also promised that you would not hurt me!”</p><p>Mei Siren was so angry that his face shape changed. He suppressed his anger and tried to calm down. Then, he said peacefully, “What else was there? What else did I say?”</p><p>As soon as Xu Xiaoshou made his pose, Mei Siren’s eyes turned serious. “Without the actions this time!”</p><p>“Oh, oh.” Xu Xiaoshou shrunk his head back, and the corner of his mouth suddenly curled up, but he was quickly forced to stop. He tried to show an innocent and naïve expression, then suddenly looked up at the sky and shouted again,</p><p>“You Tu, is this all you can do? Show me all you’ve got!”</p><p>Mei Siren was speechless.</p><p>His left hand clenched into a fist, and he almost shouted at Xu Xiaoshou’s arrogant face.</p><p>He said without action!</p><p>Also, how could he have such an expression? Even if he was in a state of cultivation deviation, he couldn’t have acted as exaggeratedly as Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“There’s more? What else did you hear?” Suppressing his anger, the words were squeezed out from between Mei Siren’s teeth.</p><p>He still wanted him to say more? Xu Xiaoshou thought he was really going to die. He withdrew his Perception from Master Siren’s murderous intent fist without leaving a trace. He suddenly jumped back, put his hands on his waist, and laughed wildly.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Mei Siren was stunned.</p><p>Was Xu Xiaoshou laughing at him?</p><p>How could he dare to show it?!</p><p>“Master Siren, don’t misunderstand, I’m not laughing at you.” Xu Xiaoshou’s laughter suddenly stopped, and he took the time to explain. Then, he put his hands on his waist and said heartlessly.</p><p>“I’m just imitating your last move.”</p><p>He seized the last moment and continued to laugh wildly.</p><p>“Hahahaha, Brother You Tu, today’s battle was truly satisfying. You’ve finally been defeated by my sword!”</p><p>“You didn’t expect this to happen, did you? Haha!”</p><p>Swish!</p><p>The cackling stopped, and Xu Xiaoshou immediately disappeared in a flash.</p><p>Sure enough, in the next second, a terrifying sword energy slashed across where he was, followed by a hysterical roar that shook the world and resounded in all directions.</p><p>“Xu! Xiao! Shou!”</p><p>Mei Siren finally knew it all.</p><p>He knew everything!</p><p>As it turned out, Xu Xiaoshou had seen and heard all of his embarrassing actions when he was in a state of cultivation deviation.</p><p>This kid had even pretended not to know anything before, but when he was asked to show it, he did it to the fullest.</p><p>He had thrown out the bait to lure a stupid fish like him to take the initiative. Then, he used a method of loosening the reins only to catch him later. This allowed him to justifiably reveal all the most shameful actions he had done since he had entered the state of cultivation deviation.</p><p>And yet, he had fallen into a trap!</p><p>This was so embarrassing that for a moment, Mei Siren, who had his toes on the ground, even had the thought of killing this boy to save his face.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou had already grown wings and flown away when the furious sword slashed down. He had clearly predicted this.</p><p>After that, it was impossible to kill by mistake.</p><p>“You brat, you really deserve to die!”</p><p>Mei Siren was so angry that he gritted his teeth. Once again, he deeply understood the meaning behind the Bazhun’an’s words, “to teach Xu Xiaoshou the sword, he must be beaten up”.</p><p>He carried the stone sword and no longer cared about the image of the so-called Seven Sword Deity. At this time, he turned into a teacher who had been provoked in the school. He lifted his feet, picked up his slippers, and rushed to the mischievous troublemaker in the last row, shouting.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>The sword energy flew over and was about to split Xu Xiaoshou in half.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cried out in a strange way. He had reached the sky in one step, and in two steps, he could not stop at all.</p><p>“You little brat, you dare to play tricks on me? Who gave you the guts?”</p><p>Mei Siren blew at his beard and glared at him. The stone sword in his hands slashed randomly, and the sword energy turned this place into ruins.</p><p>“You asked me to say it. I was already hesitating and acting like I didn’t dare to. You could clearly tell, but you still forced me. As a student, I have no choice but to obey!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
