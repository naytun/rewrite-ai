He had only exchanged a few words with the person opposite him, and he had already fallen into a trap?</p><p>“Body of Decay…”</p><p>In the previous confrontation in the Deep Sea World, Jiang Buyi had felt a vague sense of unease.</p><p>However, just like how Huang Quan and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man did not experience the real power of a Demi-Saint in the Spell Forbidden Barrier, Jiang Buyi had never seen the formation of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man in the Spell Forbidden Barrier.</p><p>That was why he had been tricked and caught off guard!</p><p>Misfortunes did not come singly which made matters worse…</p><p>It was nothing more than this!</p><p>“You have the Body of Decay? Was it suppressed by the Spell Forbidden Barrier?” Jiang Buyi’s eyes were filled with anxiety and he wanted to run away.</p><p>“Kekeke…”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man laughed evilly. He was hunched over and his hands dangled powerlessly at his side. His body emitted a mist of decay, which transformed into a pair of wing-like ferocious giant hands on his back.</p><p>“Not bad.”</p><p>“My life was destined to be like the Lone Star of Heaven…”</p><p>A hoarse voice filled with hate sounded and thunder from the Nine Heavens suddenly rumbled.</p><p>At the same time, a little light bloomed in the mist around the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. It revealed his raised face and the strange patterns in the Three Loathsome Eyes under his mask.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s mind went blank. He quickly looked away and did not dare to look again.</p><p>At this moment, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was like a ghost in his nightmare and the symbol of bad luck in his heart.</p><p>He was a Demi-Saint, an absolute superior. The person in front of him should have been like an ant, but at this time, the identity and status of both sides seemed to have been reversed.</p><p>What was the concept of a Body of Decay?</p><p>It was invincible to those below the Demi-Saint realm, but it can take on someone who was above the Demi-Saint realm!</p><p>This was something that even the other four great physiques from the ‘Five Extreme Physiques’ didn’t dare lay claim to.</p><p>However, the Body of Decay of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man dared, and even the Demi-Saints recognized this title.</p><p>He, Jiang Buyi, wanted to kill the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. Even if he was at his peak state, as the other party had said, he could kill people, but he would have to go through the Saint Calamity again.</p><p>If that was not considered as a death threat, then what was?</p><p>And now…</p><p>He wasn’t even in his prime condition, he was actually at the lowest stage!</p><p>Jiang Buyi turned around and ran without hesitation.</p><p>However, he did not dare to use his Holy Power, as the Five Decays of Heaven and Man could attack without any reservation.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>In an instant, the path was blocked. Jiang Buyi could not escape or retreat.</p><p>“D*mn it!” Jiang Buyi gritted his teeth and his eyes were about to pop out, “Don’t force me! I can kill you if I wish to.”</p><p>“Yeah, you can kill me…”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was still hunched over as his hands dangled uselessly at his sides. When he heard the sound, he turned his head away and only his faceless mask stared at him with the gaze of an evil spirit. The next second, he laughed…</p><p>“You don’t want to die, but I want to die. Can you fulfill my wish?”</p><p>Crazy!</p><p>This guy was clearly a lunatic!</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s pupils were dilated. He almost could not suppress the power exerted by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>He couldn’t use his Holy Power, and his emotions were on the verge of collapse. However, he was a Demi-Saint after all. No matter how crazy his thoughts were, he still managed to find a trace of clarity in the Spiritual Altar amid the endless chaos.</p><p>This was also the only way to survive!</p><p>Jiang Buyi suddenly quieted down. He tidied his messy hair, stretched out his hand, and pressed it down. He spoke softly.</p><p>“Don’t mess around, okay?”</p><p>“I recall that you didn’t show any ill will when you came to look for me?”</p><p>“Let’s have a good talk and calm down. This will be good for both of us, right?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
