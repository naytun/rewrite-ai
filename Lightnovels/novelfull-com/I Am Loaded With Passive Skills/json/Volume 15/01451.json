How could he be as terrifying as he was now?</p><p>However, from another perspective, Xiao Kongtong understood the reason why.</p><p>As soon as Xu Xiaoshou learned the Heart Sword Technique, he revealed his will and force. With this kind of talent, if there were no interference from any outsiders, there was a slight possibility that he could cultivate the skill of Present Gods and Buddhas.</p><p>If he did, he would truly be able to break all the historical records of the Heart Sword Technique, even if it had been his Teacher who had set them.</p><p>From a deeper level, Master Siren and Master You Tu had fought for a lifetime, both openly and secretly. The latter had found his Teacher, Bazhun’an and could be considered to be almost his part successor already.</p><p>On the other hand, the former had students all over the world, but was suppressed in every aspect, and did not have any disciples that he was proud of.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong knew how much hope Master Siren had placed on Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Even if Xiao Kongtong didn’t want to admit it, if Xu Xiaoshou cultivated well, there was a slight chance that he could break the record of ‘Three breaths for innate stage, three years for Sword Deity’!</p><p>Various thoughts flashed through his mind. When he saw that Master Siren was about to fly out with his stone sword lifted in anger, Xiao Kongtong thought quickly and under great pressure, he spoke up.</p><p>“Calm down, Master Siren, calm down.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is at a critical stage now and his cultivation can’t be disrupted at the moment. He needs your help, and you are well aware of the dangers that lurk in Abyss Island. What if this was a trick to ‘lure the tiger out of the mountain’?”</p><p>With this single sentence, Mei Siren calmed down instantly.</p><p>As the Eldest Senior Brother of the Fringe Moon Immortal City and the one in charge of the entire realm, Xiao Kongtong’s general understanding of the overall situation was unquestionable. His grasp of the situation was way better than Mei Siren who was detached from worldly affairs.</p><p>When he saw the pair of eyes filled with gloom, Xiao Kongtong had already decided on his next step.</p><p>“You just stay here. Even if a Demi-Saint comes, he won’t destroy Xu Xiaoshou’s Dao. As long as it’s not a Demi-Saint, I can handle it.”</p><p>“But if I were to move, I may not be able to guard Xu Xiaoshou well.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong spoke firmly in a tone that brooked no further discussion.</p><p>He believed that Master Siren understood what he meant. There were indeed Demi-Saints on the Abyss Island. It was better to be safe than sorry!</p><p>What if there was someone else behind those two guys?</p><p>Mei Siren listened silently and tightened his grip on the stone sword. Soon, his expression returned to normal and he nodded, “You’re right, I was a little impulsive.”</p><p>He paused for a moment and as he glanced at Xu Xiaoshou, who was enveloped in devilish energy, a sharp light flashed in his eyes.</p><p>“Don’t let even a single one off”</p><p>“Leave it to me.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong nodded, with a solemn expression.</p><p>What a joke; it was also his mission to protect Xu Xiaoshou. If something happened to him, how would he explain it to his Teacher?</p><p>As for Xu Xiaoshou’s inner demons…</p><p>He believed that Master Siren would have his own plan. After all, he had not been hit by the arrow of the Evil Sin Bow, and there would be a way out.</p><p>With a tap of his foot, his figure disappeared instantly.</p><p>When it was time to leave, there was only one thing that left Xiao Kongtong confused.</p><p>He had not sensed anything special from both their auras in the distance, such as the auras of Demi- Saints.</p><p>If they did not have the backing of a Demi-Saint, how could they dare to attack Xu Xiaoshou from such a distance?</p><p>Didn’t the two of them realize that there were two more people next to Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>It was understandable that they did not know who Master Siren was. After all, if one wasn’t an Ancient Swordsman who had made a great achievement, they probably would not have seen Master Siren’s actual face.</p><p>But at this moment, Xiao Kongtong was not disguised as Bazhun’an!</p><p>To be honest, he felt that his face was not as well known as his Teacher’s. A glance was sufficient to scare off a Demi-Saint.</p><p>However, in the Holy Sword Land of the Eastern Region, among those who had already reached the Higher Void State, who would not recognize the Eldest Senior Brother of the Fringe Moon Immortal City?</p><p>From the looks of it, those two must have something to fall back on!</p><p>It was better to be careful in this operation!</p><p>The Kingdom of Giants was about ten streets away and at a distance of ten miles.</p><p>Ghost Granny only took a quick glimpse and immediately put away the Spiritual Banner. She was afraid that if she looked any longer, she would attract the attention of the other party.</p><p>“That was indeed Xu Xiashou!”</p><p>“I’ve searched high and low for him. Xu Xiaoshou was really on the Abyss Island. When did he come in?”</p><p>This question was obviously not the key. Why did these two assassins from the Three Incenses travel from the Central Region to the Eastern Region? They were after Xu Xiaoshou’s head!</p><p>There was no assassin in the world who would not be tempted by the Black Gold Bounty reward.</p><p>“Could it be a fake?” Elder Xie was pleasantly surprised, but he was also a little worried. This was the natural instinct of an assassin.</p><p>Ghost Granny shook her head and laughed, “I can’t be wrong. You’re too timid. Didn’t you do a whole lot of investigation on that kid? How could you even think that it was a fake?”</p><p>The face transmitted by the Spiritual Banner was undoubtedly Xu Xiaoshou’s.</p><p>Even his aura matched the information on the Black Gold Bounty perfectly. He was just a junior and did not have the Cutting Path Stage or the aura of a higher void level.</p><p>Even if she couldn’t make out the exact realm, that kid was the real deal. His young bone structure was sufficient proof.</p><p>On the Abyss Island, other than the demon Xu Xiaoshou, who else would dare to enter this Grandmaster Realm, where even the higher void level would perish?</p><p>Elder Xie had obviously taken note of this as well, but for some reason, he still felt that something was amiss.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
