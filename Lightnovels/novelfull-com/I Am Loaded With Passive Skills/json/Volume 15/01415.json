I’ll Wash, Wash, Wash (1)</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The Void Attendant looked at his good friend in front of him and his heart was filled with gratitude.</p><p>Only the Heavens knew how many distress signals it had sent out when it was being beaten up after it underestimated the strength of that Demi-Saint.</p><p>However, his companions were either trapped in other dangerous places, had yet to wake up, or had received the signal but also sensed the Holy Power fluctuations of the battle here, so none of them dared to come over!</p><p>After putting on a show in the Holy Realm for quite some time, the Void Attendant was in utter despair.</p><p>Its only hope was that its opponent’s target was not itself, but another human.</p><p>Perhaps at the end of the battle, they would forget about its existence; they would forget about it in their bid for survival.</p><p>He didn’t expect that…</p><p>When the humans’ aides arrived, the Void Attendant could also wait for its companions to come and help.</p><p>It was very powerful. When even the Stone Giants didn’t dare to venture in rashly, its companion was all alone. This companion didn’t care about its life and death; it just rushed up and dragged it away.</p><p>In the end, the battle was over, and all the Stone Giants who were so afraid of death died – it was such a relief!</p><p>However, the Void Attendant and its companion had survived. This was the power of ‘helping each other’- Brotherhood!</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The Void Attendant expressed its gratitude in their language to its companion.</p><p>Although it was grateful, it also had a niggling doubt – a doubt that it had since this companion appeared.</p><p>For example, why did it look so similar to him?</p><p>In the eyes of humans, most Void Attendants looked the same, but in the eyes of their own people, there was a huge difference.</p><p>However, this companion who had risked its life to save it, let alone ‘twins’, the Void Attendant felt that even the blood, energy, and body structure of this companion were identical to its own.</p><p>After all, just like how there were no two identical leaves in the world, there were no two identical Void Attendants on the Abyss Island.</p><p>Long-lost brothers or distant relative? Or could it be that it was an Elder from his lineage? An old Senior?</p><p>The Void Attendant could only make a guess.</p><p>Apart from that, it was also puzzled by something else.</p><p>Why did the Void Attendant’s companion have a faint aura of the Spiritual Herbs from the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer on its body?</p><p>This was a crucial question! It was also very fatal!</p><p>Of course, it wasn’t to say that it was fatal to its companion, but to himself.</p><p>The Void Attendant was still in a state of shock in the aftermath of the battle between the Demi-Saints and naturally did not dare to ask much. He had just let itself be saved by its companion.</p><p>One of the rules of the Abyss Island was that the Guardian would not steal the objects it guarded.</p><p>Based on this rule, the Void Attendant had reason to believe that its companion was definitely not the thief who had pilfered the herbs from the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>As for the aura, its companion would give an explanation after the battle ended and both of them survived it.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>After he left the three humans, Xu Xiaoshou went over to the Void Attendant. He rubbed the giant’s head and comforted it and said in the Void Attendant’s language, “We’re all family. You don’t have to be so polite. You don’t have to think about how to repay me.”</p><p>The biggest advantage when one had the Imitator was that as long as one had the blood, the fake could be passed off as the real one.</p><p>To obtain the other party’s cultivation insights, master the Void Attendant’s language and understand the language of the giant in front of him was not a problem at all for the one who had the Imitator.</p><p>From the moment he took the risk to transform into the Void Attendant and when the big guy in front of him had no clue about his identity, Xu Xiaoshou knew that the game was more or less in the bag.</p><p>“The Imitator is really powerful!”</p><p>“To a Spiritual Cultivator, it’s practically invincible. If I can get more blood, I’ll be like a tiger with wings!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had only realized the extent of the power of a Demi-Saint’s full-force attack when he encountered the Saint.</p><p>Naturally, he once again had an enlightenment on the value of Water Ghost’s Sea God’s Trident that day on the Yunlun Mountain Range. It was able to destroy the arrow from Ai Cangsheng’s Evil Sin Bow with a single strike of the Trident.</p><p>As one of the top ten Great Psionic Weapons…</p><p>The power of the Sea God’s Trident lay in its ability to amplify the combat strength of the water-type Spiritual Cultivator, while the Imitator was all about its auxiliary functions.</p><p>“The Void Attendant can only recognize me through my face or special senses. I’m the Abyss Island Sinner whose name had been engraved on the Void Suppression Stele, number 800820.”</p><p>“But with the Void Attendant’s blood, it can change all of my inner qualities, just like how it can change the attributes of a Spiritual Cultivator!”</p><p>“Even someone as powerful as the Void Attendant can no longer use any means to sense that my true form is actually number 800820.”</p><p>This was the information that Xu Xiaoshou had gathered when he saved the Void Attendant.</p><p>What good would that be?</p><p>It served a great purpose.</p><p>This meant that in the future, Xu Xiaoshou, who had obtained the Void Attendant’s blood on the Abyss Island, with the Imitator, could basically support this giant body without any obstruction as long as he did not encounter a Saint.</p><p>“A ‘sinner’ and a ‘warden’, which one was more important in a prison?”</p><p>One could tell at a glance!</p><p>Most importantly, when one became a Void Attendant, it meant that when you spoke to another Void Attendant, there would no longer be a difference in status between the two.</p><p>What kind of creature was a Void Attendant?</p><p>First of all, its combat strength was powerful, but it was simple-minded. Secondly, it was simple-minded, and finally, it was extremely simple-minded!</p><p>With these three points, in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes, this kind of creature was simply stupid and cute compared to Jiang Buyi. How much more fun was that!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
