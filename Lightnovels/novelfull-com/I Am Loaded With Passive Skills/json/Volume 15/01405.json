He almost could not tell that the scroll had Holy Power fluctuations. it was all thanks to Ye Xiaotian’s reminder.</p><p>Then, he unconsciously took a step forward.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian followed suit and flew over slowly, intending to pick up the scroll to take a look.</p><p>“Hold on!” These two people’s actions that went against common sense made Mei Siren’s hair stand on end, and he immediately shouted.</p><p>The two people in front seemed to have been woken up by the shout and were shocked.</p><p>Why did they want to take the scroll?</p><p>It was obvious that Jiang Buyi had left this thing behind. Their first reaction should have been to stay away from it or destroy it from a distance!</p><p>Greed?</p><p>No one here would think that their strange behavior was due to greed because they knew that they were such people.</p><p>Even if it was Jiang Buyi’s lost defensive soul weapon… As people who could even give up the Holy Emperor person, how could they be greedy?</p><p>“No! It’s not a soul weapon!” Xiao Kongtong stared at the scroll and suddenly thought of something, “There was no scroll-shaped object among the soul weapons he used to fight you, Master Siren. I definitely didn’t remember the process wrong. After all, I still have to review it later…”</p><p>Before he finished his sentence, the black-red scroll on the ground suddenly buzzed and trembled, then exploded with shocking Holy Power!</p><p>Waves of Holy Power that were visible to the naked eye almost covered the entire Forest of Miracles in an instant. The three people who were at the forefront were undoubtedly the most affected.</p><p>“Heart…” Before Xiao Kongtong could even finish his sentence, his eyelids drooped, and the Present Gods and Buddhas behind him straightened their backs. With a boom, they stabilized his mind so that he was not affected by the Holy power.</p><p>“Close…” Ye Xiaotian did the same. He used his life-saving technique without hesitation. After swallowing the Holy Blood in his mouth with no heartache, a Spatial Power Upanishad Formation was formed under his feet.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, it was as if the three of them were close, yet worlds apart from the black-red scroll. The distance between them was clearly not far, yet also vast and boundless.</p><p>Demi-Saint Infernal’s Holy Blood had no side effects, and Ye Xiaotian’s combat strength was instantly boosted to the peak.</p><p>The scroll’s Holy Power was unable to shatter the folded space he had summoned!</p><p>Close, yet worlds apart seemed to be as vast as tens of thousands of Abyss Islands. It blocked the Holy Power and gave the three of them a sense of security.</p><p>“What a luxury…” Xiao Kongtong was extremely envious. Compared to these people with resources and backgrounds, his Present Gods and Buddhas were like a joke. They could only protect him.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was merely at the Sovereign Stage, yet he was able to protect all three of them at once!</p><p>Just as these thoughts flashed through their minds, the two of them could not help but look at the black and red scroll again.</p><p>It was certain that Jiang Buyi did not have any good intentions in leaving the scroll behind. After the Holy Power surged, it actually floated and unfurled in the air.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>In an instant, even though they were so close to each other, Xiao Kongtong and Ye Xiaotian felt their hearts tremble. It was as if someone had hammered them in the soul.</p><p>In the next second, the black and red scroll seemed to have opened up in their souls to its greatest, covering the entire space of consciousness!</p><p>Mei Siren’s heart trembled slightly, and he finally recalled what that thing in front of them was.</p><p>He closed his eyes abruptly, and at the same time, a sword-image monster appeared in his mind. It gave his will a fierce slash.</p><p>With this, the black and red scroll in his mind shattered.</p><p>After doing all this, Mei Siren finally had the strength to move. He turned the heads of the two people away and roared angrily, “Don’t turn back!!! This is the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree, you can’t read it! You can’t take it!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
