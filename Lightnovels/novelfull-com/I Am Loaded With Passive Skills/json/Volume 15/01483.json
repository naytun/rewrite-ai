After it shot out from his body, it gave the people around it a brief shock, as if they had been pricked by needles.</p><p>In the next second, it retracted back into Xu Xiaoshou’s body as if it was an illusion.</p><p>At the same time, Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils suddenly enlarged. Sword Will gathered in his eyes and turned into two small dark swords.</p><p>“Ghost sign!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s squinty eyes widened in amazement. He could not believe that Xu Xiaoshou managed to complete the condensation of the ‘Ghost sign’ in such a short time.</p><p>But how could he not believe…</p><p>As far as he could see, the small swords in Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils were exactly the same as his.</p><p>This was clearly a condensed and extremely mature form of the ‘Ghost sign’ that seemed to have many years of experience.</p><p>“What’s this?” Mei Siren was also stunned.</p><p>He could understand why the spirit summoning was a success because Xu Xiaoshou’s spirit and soul were strong to begin with.</p><p>However, was the ability to condense a ‘ghost sign’ something that could be done in an instant?</p><p>No need to try it first?</p><p>No need to fail?</p><p>He didn’t need to go around in circles to find the feeling; was he able to condense it successfully, only because it was accidental?</p><p>At a certain moment, the shadows of Bazhun’an and Hua Changdeng flashed through Mei Siren’s mind.</p><p>With such keen talent in the art of the Phantom Swords Technique, apart from these two and Xu Xiaoshou, even You Tu from back then could not form it so quickly.</p><p>“How could this be?” Ghost Granny was shocked.</p><p>She could not fathom how much power was contained in Xu Xiaoshou’s ‘Ghost sign’.</p><p>However, going by her feelings and the reactions of Mei Siren and Xiao Kongtong, there was only one explanation for this – Xu Xiaoshou had already accomplished the ‘achievement at one go!”</p><p>Was he a rare genius? A genius that belonged to the Ancient Swordsman?</p><p>“I don’t think I can wait any longer…”</p><p>Before this, she had been disdainful and didn’t think that Xu Xiaoshou could master the Phantom Swords Technique overnight. Now, Ghost Granny’s sixth sense told her…</p><p>Just tonight!</p><p>It was right in front of her!</p><p>It seemed that Xu Xiaoshou had mastered the first stage of the Spirits Controlling of the Phantom Swords Technique. Was that a possibility?</p><p>However…</p><p>“Even if I can’t wait, I have to wait!”</p><p>Even if she wanted to kill Xu Xiaoshou before he matured, it was ridiculous since Mei Siren and Xiao Kongtong, the two actual guardians, were standing guard at the side.</p><p>No matter how anxious Ghost Granny was, she had to suppress her killing intent and wait for Xu Xiaoshou to master the Phantom Swords Technique, so they could have a fair and square end to her current predicament.</p><p>“There’s still a chance. Don’t be in such a hurry.”</p><p>“Things have not even begun to take shape yet. Mei Siren also said that this was only the second of the three great thresholds of practicing the Phantom Swords Technique.”</p><p>“Right, the threshold!” Ghost Granny nodded decisively and tried to comfort herself.</p><p>“That’s all!”</p><p>At dusk, the long street suddenly fell silent for the length of a full ten breaths because the ‘Ghost sign’ in Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils had been successfully condensed.</p><p>Mei Siren’s heart was in a turmoil. He really felt that he had picked up a treasure!</p><p>Before this, they had placed Xu Xiaoshou on the same level as Bazhun’an. They wanted to train a student who was strong enough to compete with You Tu. This was just a simple thought that Mei Siren had.</p><p>Now, he felt that…</p><p>One had to dare to think in order to live! He dared to do it!</p><p>“It’s done?” The elderly Sword Deity gritted his teeth, his tone not as calm as usual. “It’s done.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded.</p><p>“Then try again. Mobilize the power of the Sword Will in the ‘Ghost sign’ and transmit it to the ‘spirit’ you just summoned using the ‘transmission’ method that I taught you before. Try to ‘control’ them.”</p><p>He paused for a moment. Then Mei Siren laughed lightly and tapped the paper fan in his hand,</p><p>“This requires very strong control. You still have to learn the art of ‘one mind, two tasks’, then split it to ‘one mind, multi tasks’, and seriously practice ‘preaching’. In short, you can’t mess up your own movements when you’re using them.”</p><p>Mei Siren did not continue.</p><p>Before he could finish his words, the ‘Ghost sign’ in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up. The ‘spirits’ on the long street seemed to have been summoned, and small dark swords lit up among them.</p><p>This was not all.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled and flapped his hand in the air.</p><p>“Close!”</p><p>The countless ‘spirits’, like arms and fingers, seemed to be enslaved and followed his will. They gathered in the night and turned into an enormous ‘light fan’ that was more than a hundred feet tall.</p><p>The spiritual points on the light fan dissolved and rearranged themselves into two large words:</p><p>“Like this?”</p><p>After the big words, there was a ‘?’ filled with spiritual quality and it bobbed up and down slowly.</p><p>Mei Siren clenched the folding fan in his hand tightly and could not suppress the shock in his heart.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s ability to control spirits wasn’t scary. What was scary was that he could control so many spirits at the same time!</p><p>Even if these spirits did not have intelligence and did not know how to fight back, just how terrifying would the consumption of a person’s mental and spiritual energy be?</p><p>Oh, wait…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was able to use the Heart Sword Technique of the Present Gods and Buddhas three times in a row without consuming any of his mental strength, so that was nothing.</p><p>Mei Siren’s mouth was agape and he could not say anything for a long time.</p><p>“Pa, pa, pa!”</p><p>The sound of clapping came from the side. Xiao Kongtong’s eyes moved away from the light fan, quickly glanced at Master Siren’s paper fan, and then returned to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He shook his head and sighed, “Kid, you’re really something else.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
