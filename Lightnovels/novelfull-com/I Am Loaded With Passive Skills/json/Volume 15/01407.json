The world is not perfect. I am not perfect. To become perfect does not mean I am perfect. The perfection you imagine doesn’t exist in the world!”</p><p>Mei Siren’s Sword Image roared, and its eyes were red. It was like a person who had entered and emerged from the mortal world. With the most basic of words, it gave a head-on blow to the person who was about to fall into the abyss and pulled him back.</p><p>“Don’t stray from the Deviated path and don’t waste time on an insignificant problem.”</p><p>“Time this old man had a wake up call!”</p><p>As he swung his sword, the true meaning of ‘return’ that guided the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree, was instantly destroyed in Ye Xiaotian’s mind.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was drenched in sweat and his body trembled violently as he regained consciousness.</p><p>The sweat on his forehead dripped onto the bridge of his nose and he felt a burning pain in his chest. He lowered his head and found that he had almost torn his body in half and pulled out his liver and lungs with his hands. Naturally, he was so scared that his soul almost left his body.</p><p>“You were too obsessed.”</p><p>Mei Siren sighed. After he roused him, he did not to delay any longer and looked at Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian hurriedly took out some Elixirs, swallowed them and tried his best to suppress the impulse of the source in his body. He forced himself not to look at the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree again.</p><p>After his injuries healed slightly, he then had the energy to look at Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was in a much better state than him.</p><p>The most difficult thing for an Ancient Swordsman to cultivate was willpower, but it was also the most powerful.</p><p>As such, compared to Ye Xiaotian, Xiao Kongtong had more perseverance. After all, he had seen the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree before. He only managed to hold on for ten more breaths than Ye Xiaotian before a look of deep regret appeared on his face.</p><p>As soon as this expression appeared, the true meaning of ‘return’ was also revealed</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s face contorted and it was no longer the face of Bazhun’an. At the same time, the scar on his neck faded away and his thumbs grew back as he reverted to his original appearance.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Mei Siren was stunned.</p><p>“You, you, you are not Bazhun’an?”</p><p>Before he could help, Xiao Kongtong who had reverted to his original form, struggled violently and seemed to be fighting the most intense battle in his heart.</p><p>His memories were in a mess.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong felt as if he had returned to his younger days, having met the man who had turned his mediocre life into another extreme.</p><p>This was the ultimate ‘return’ in his Spiritual World.</p><p>‘Young man, I see that you have an excellent appearance and extraordinary muscles, like an immortal who had been banished from the Heavens. You also have the ‘Phaseless Sword body’. This Sword body will suit me well and I just lack one thing. Ah, I’m deviating from the topic. Let me put it this way, I have a peerless secret book here, which contains all my life’s knowledge for the last ten thousand years. Do you want to study it?”</p><p>It was hard to imagine that these words, which seemed to be a scam, were actually spoken by this beguiling man dressed in white.</p><p>He carried two giant swords on his back, one purple and one gold, and two thin swords on his waist, one black and one green. He looked graceful and noble and had an extraordinary bearing, but his words came as a shock, like a schemer from the Martial Arts World.</p><p>“You’re the ‘kidnapper’ mentioned in the books, right? They specialize in deceiving children and abducting them for money.” The child didn’t fall for it at all. He licked the lollipop in his hand and looked curiously at the woman beside the strange uncle. He couldn’t see her face clearly, but he remembered that she should be a very good-looking auntie. Was this the ‘kidnapping lady’?”</p><p>“What!” The kidnapper spluttered. “Little brat, where are your parents?”</p><p>“I’m from the orphanage. Grandma Hu went to buy some fruits over there. She’ll be back soon.” The child pointed somewhere else, where an old woman suddenly looked around in alarm. “It seems like Grandma Hu can’t see me?”</p><p>“You’re an orphan?” the man mumbled to himself and did not seem to mind. “Little brat, my inheritance is most powerful and I will not charge you for it and I don’t intend to sell you off either. Take my secret manual, you can read it when you have the time. Just treat it as a source for you to recognize words. You’ll pick it up very quickly.”</p><p>He took out a thick ancient book and without any explanation, said temptingly, “Do you want to go to Heaven? Do you want to ride a flying sword? Do you want to be as free and unrestrained as an Immortal? Open this book and you can do it!”</p><p>“I do…” The child put down his lollipop, as if he had been tempted. However, when he recalled his Grandma Hu’s teachings, he…</p><p>“It’s right to agree!” The kidnapper unceremoniously smacked the thick ancient book into his forehead!</p><p>The little boy was scared out of his wits.</p><p>“Such a thick book had disappeared? It’s in my head?”</p><p>“That’s incredible!”</p><p>“Learn it well, practice well, and come find me again when you’re famous. If you’re not famous, you’re not allowed to say that you’re my disciple!”</p><p>…</p><p>‘Return’. He returned to the chaos.</p><p>He had intermittent fragments of chaotic memories.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was still lost in his confusion when the kidnapper’s voice appeared in his ears again, as if it was a follow up of his thoughts.</p><p>“It’s not hard to practice with a sword. You can do it in a few seconds. I don’t have much time to teach you. We’re going to fight tomorrow, so I’ll give you a simple demonstration!”</p><p>“Watch carefully. I’ll only demonstrate it once. How much you can remember is up to you.”</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>“This is called ‘Present Gods and Buddhas’, this is called ‘Wisdom’…</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>“This is called ‘Space-time Transition’. This is called ‘Second World’.</p><p>“Swish”</p><p>“This is called the ‘Spirit Controlling Ghost Art’. This is called the ‘Lord of Phantom City’.”</p><p>Endless ghosts filled the entire street.</p><p>However, the people on the street were still indifferent, as if they could not see them at all.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
