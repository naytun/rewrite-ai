Moreover, his sword had transformed from Acquired to Innate to Master and then to the Sovereign Stage. His cultivation journey just flowed freely and wildly as water.</p><p>However, all these changes were stuck at a certain point in time.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was already a Sovereign when it came to the Way of the Sword, and he had the richest knowledge of everything related to the Way of the Sword because of his Sword Technique Expertise.</p><p>However, this title of the Sovereign was not as solid as it seemed to be.</p><p>Gu Qing, who was of the same generation as him, had already mastered part of the Nine Major Sword Techniques’s Eighteen Sword Forms and knew something about 3000 Sword Styles.</p><p>Yet, he knew nothing about ancient swordsman cultivation.</p><p>No matter how rich his theoretical knowledge was, even if it was as vast as the ocean, Xu Xiaoshou’s ability to turn theory into combat strength was pathetically insufficient.</p><p>The output was so powerless, as if it didn’t exist.</p><p>“I’m already very strong…” he thought. Before the night battle in Dongtianwang City, Master Siren had intended to take him as a disciple. However, Xu Xiaoshou was over-confident then, thinking he did not need to be apprenticed to a master but relied on his Skill Point to break through the obstacles of swordsmanship.</p><p>Perhaps Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t arrogant but believed he would make it one day.</p><p>However, when would the day of his breaking through the obstacles of Way of the Sword come?</p><p>In other words, he needed time!</p><p>After personally witnessing Rao Yaoyao’s Secular Sword, hearing Xiao Kongtong’s description of the Nine Major Sword Techniques, and then experiencing more and more dangerous situations and enemies with stronger and stronger combat power, Xu Xiaoshou regretted his decision long ago.</p><p>“I don’t have enough time!”</p><p>Without this, he would have thought about looking for Bazhun’an and cultivating the Ancient Sword Technique on his journey of the Way of the Sword.</p><p>If not for that, he would have had enough courage to ask Master Siren to take him as a principal after refusing him.</p><p>Which sword cultivator would not be moved by Mei Siren’s supreme sword image, stepping on Yama and having thousands of swords worshipping In the Forest of Miracles? Master Siren was the man combining the four realms and defeating a demi-saint!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was extremely tempted!</p><p>When using Vanishing Technique, he tried to memorize every detail of the scene with all his might. He wanted to keep everything in his mind and analyze it later to see if he could comprehend something.</p><p>If it didn’t work, he could go to Bazhun’an and ask him to explain. After all, it would be a waste not to use such a powerful backer.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou had never thought that before finding the wanderer Bazhun’an, Master Siren had given him a second chance!</p><p>“I…!”</p><p>Looking at the stone sword in front of him, Xu Xiaoshou blushed. He was a bit ashamed and embarrassed.</p><p>This stone sword was rather simple and unnoticeable!</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou realized that the most mysterious door of the Ancient Sword Technique was opening for him again!</p><p>The hand that pushed the door open was not fully riveted behind his back in an attempt to break in.</p><p>On the contrary, he was sitting on the Sovereign Stage inside the sect, who could crush the insurmountable threshold of ancient swordsman cultivation with a flip of his hand, the Supreme master of the Way of the Sword!</p><p>“I’ve rejected him once…” Just as Yingying was hesitating, a voice came to his mind.</p><p>“Stop thinking about this! Xu Xiaoshou! If you don’t take this opportunity, you’ll be the dumbest person in the entire Shengshen Continent!”</p><p>“Is Perception of a Sovereign Stage cultivator just a decoration? Where is your brain? Are you deaf? Did you hear Mr. Siren was trying to teach you in Forest of Miracles? Are you blind? Can’t you see who came out to save you at the last moment?”</p><p>“Don’t you know where Communication Talisman was locked onto? Don’t you know the deep meaning behind this?”</p><p>“Without the help of Bazhun’an, would Mister Siren have Communication Talisman? Would you be able to wait for a second chance from Master Siren?”</p><p>“The opportunity is right before you, yet you’re still hesitating?”</p><p>Within a few seconds, Xu Xiaoshou made up his mind. He raised his eyes and looked at Master Siren, who had a gentle smile and an ordinary-looking stone sword.</p><p>“I want to!” Xu Xiaoshou finally said loudly, showing his pure intention and determination.</p><p>He was not an idiot. As someone who could twist a demi-saint around his finger, he should understand why Master Siren had brought Communication Talisman to the Forest of Miracles to save him.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou still did not dare to reach out to take the sword.</p><p>Master Siren passed it to him as if it was nothing, but he could not accept it just like this.</p><p>“If you want it, take it.” Mei Siren smiled. The hand seemed to have been tempered thousands of times, not moving at all with the sword.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong saw the scene and was nervous.</p><p>At this moment, he wished he could have possessed Xu Xiaoshou’s body, taken the stone sword for him, bowed to Mei Siren, and then returned control of this flesh to Xu Xiaoshou.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
