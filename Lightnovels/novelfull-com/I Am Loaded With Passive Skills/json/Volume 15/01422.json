His eyes bulged, and his vision blurred. Everything in the world began to drift away from him.</p><p>The figure was also trapped in another water ball, but he was unmoved and extremely calm.</p><p>He finally turned around completely, but everything was still blurry, and his face could not be seen clearly at all.</p><p>Yu Lingdi desperately tried to break out of the water!</p><p>He wasn’t the child who couldn’t fight back anymore. He was now a master of Water-type Upanishad!</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Finally, when he was about to drown, the Upanishad Formation under his feet unfurled. This time, Yu Lingdi didn’t need any external force. He broke the water ball of despair that had trapped him.</p><p>The water ball cracked!</p><p>Yu Lingdi didn’t say anything and immediately pounced forward.</p><p>He wanted to tear the water ball apart. He wanted to get to the truth. He wanted to know all the answers!</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>However, the world of water churned and huge waves came crashing down, suppressing Yu Lingdi once again. He was trapped in the deep sea and could not move.</p><p>“You’ve grown…”</p><p>A gratified laugh came from the Nine Heavens. Yu Lingdi, who was suppressed by the deep sea, desperately raised his head.</p><p>Perhaps it was because he had pounced forward for a while, but he felt that he could finally see something clearly.</p><p>Although the face was still blurry, the blurry figure in the water ball had a color that did not match the dark blue of this world.</p><p>The golden resplendent… Yu Lingdi reached out. He wanted to tear apart the illusions.</p><p>However, the figure seemed to have noticed something as well. He suddenly turned around and walked away. As he walked, the world in the water began to collapse.</p><p>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”</p><p>Everything returned to the original chaos.</p><p>Yu Lingdi refused to leave. He shouted madly before his soul passed through the chaos.</p><p>“Tell me! Who are you?”</p><p>With another boom, the world finally collapsed, and everything turned into nothingness.</p><p>Just when Yu Lingdi thought that he wouldn’t be able to get an answer, a long sigh sounded in his mind. The voice wasn’t loud, but it was deeply imprinted in the depths of his soul.</p><p>“Long time no see, my child.”</p><p>…</p><p>“Father!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s eyes were bloodshot as he pounced forward, but he grasped at nothing.</p><p>“Whoosh…”</p><p>The rain around him fell heavily on his soul, making his heart beat wildly.</p><p>A ray of heavenly light pierced through his eyes. Yu Lingdi was stunned for a moment. he opened his hands and found that his hands had returned to their normal size. The feeling of suffocation had also disappeared.</p><p>This kind of realism…</p><p>He came back!</p><p>He looked around and saw a towering Saint Punishment Pillar on the side of the huge Saint Execution Ground. In front of it was an extremely tall black figure that was filled with a gloomy aura.</p><p>“I was saved?”</p><p>Yu Lingdi stared at the Saint Punishment Pillar in a daze.</p><p>In his memory, before the dream, he was still hanging on the Saint Punishment Pillar, unable to do anything.</p><p>Now that he had just woken up from the dream, he was immediately released from the sealed state and regained his freedom?</p><p>“Ye Xiao?”</p><p>There was no one else around, only this one person.</p><p>Yu Lingdi looked at the figure in front of him, his expression was somewhat surprised. “You, why are you here?”</p><p>“Swish-”</p><p>The three-legged black owl on the figure’s shoulder let out a long cry, and the clear cry stopped the rain. Ye Xiao was as quiet as ever, and muttered a word softly, “Us.”</p><p>Us?</p><p>You guys?</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s pupils contracted as if he had understood something.”Sword Deity Rao and the rest have all entered?”</p><p>“Swish-”</p><p>The three-legged black owl flapped its wings and paced around on the black feathers covering Ye Xiao’s shoulder.</p><p>If Ye Xiao didn’t deny it, it meant that the truth… This truth made Yu Lingdi realize that the dream just now might have been fake, but the pain before was all real!</p><p>The gate of Abyss Island had been opened because of his Water-type Upanishad.</p><p>There was no doubt that this was the only reason why Bazhun’an had tied him to the Saint Punishment Pillar. That man used this method to communicate with the outside world and send everyone to Abyss Island.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“Something’s wrong!”</p><p>“If Bazhun’an wants to use me as a connection, that means he didn’t send people to Abyss Island through normal channels, but through the void gate.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s heart trembled as he seemed to have understood something.</p><p>“The opening of the ‘void gate’ requires a sacrifice, but to connect the two worlds, a specific ‘key’ is also required!”</p><p>“I’m the ‘key’ in Abyss Island, so there must be someone of the same level and power outside as the ‘key’ to open the world channel.”</p><p>“…Who could it be?”</p><p>Almost immediately, Yu Lingdi thought of the dream world just now.</p><p>Corresponding water ability, overwhelming strength, a resurrected person.</p><p>Yu Lingdi suddenly stopped thinking.</p><p>This was because his next guess would definitely be wrong.</p><p>He had died at the hands of Bazhun’an, how could he still be used by that man? He would be crazy to change sides! Whether he was alive or not was another matter.</p><p>Yu Lingdi felt that what he had experienced just now was only a Second World outlined by the Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>It was just Bazhun’an’s usual trickery!</p><p>“You saved me.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi raised his eyes and stared at Ye Xiao seriously as he said, “Although we didn’t have many interactions in the past, I can’t thank you enough for your great kindness. I will remember today. In the future, if you need any help in the operations of the dark group, just let me know.”</p><p>“Swish-”</p><p>Ye Xiao shook her head.</p><p>Yu Lingdi ignored her action and turned his head to look at the Saint Punishment Pillar.</p><p>“Thank you for saving me from here. I’ve met Gu Qing Yi before, but he was of the same generation as me, and was unable to save me.”</p><p>“Only you, the Dark Division Chief, who has a strange ability that even I don’t know about, can save me.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
