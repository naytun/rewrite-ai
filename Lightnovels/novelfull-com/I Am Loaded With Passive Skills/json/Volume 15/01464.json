We can’t mess it up ourselves, don’t you think so?”</p><p>“You’re right!” Ghost Granny nodded heavily and calmed down. She looked around, but her feet were heavy and she didn’t dare to move.</p><p>“So, after running so far, we’re still back at the starting point. What other good ideas do you have?” She turned her head and said, “Take out your ‘evil technique’. I can’t break the array under normal circumstances. The Illusion Array of Xiao Kongtong is the illusion of the Fantasy Sword Technique!</p><p>Ghost Granny was clearly afraid.</p><p>The most terrifying thing about the ancient swordsmen of the Eastern Region was that it was rare to meet a Spiritual Cultivator from the Central Region.</p><p>After all, there were only a few ancient swordsmen, and all of them were the best of the best. Normal Spiritual Cultivators didn’t even have the right to challenge them, let alone interact with them. How could they have accumulated experience in dealing with the Fantasy Sword Technique in advance?</p><p>Those so-called experiences could only be the imagination of a frog in a well!</p><p>“There’s still a way, there’s still a way, there must be…” Elder Xie muttered to himself.</p><p>“This old man still has one last method. There’s still one last move in the ‘strange sect’s evil technique’, and that is to open the ‘Cursed Yin Eye’ on my body. This is the craziest move!”</p><p>“The ‘Cursed Yin Eye’ will see through all lies. After all, it itself is a synonym for ‘evil’. At that time, this old man will temporarily borrow the power of the ‘evil god’. This is, this is a power on that level!”</p><p>“Evil god?” Ghost Granny’s scratching movements stopped, and her eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>“Yes, but I… I will…” Elder Xie gasped for breath. He had hidden this trump card too well, and now he had no choice but to reveal it. “I will go crazy! It is the kind of madness that will make me completely lose my mind! But I’ll definitely see through the illusion and bring you back to the real world. I’m really good to you, and what you have to do is…”</p><p>He stopped talking and suddenly raised his hand to clamp down on Ghost Granny’s shoulder. He said with great force, “You must knock me out and bring me out! You have to take me with you, do you understand?”</p><p>Elder Xie’s eyes had even turned red from overusing his strength.</p><p>Trust between killers was not desirable.</p><p>But he had no other choice. At this moment, he could only completely hand his life over to this old partner of his who had been his partner for decades.</p><p>If Ghost Granny was scared and ran away, everything would be over.</p><p>He would be completely devoured by the evil god’s will and buried in the grave that was Abyss Island.</p><p>“Don’t worry. I won’t abandon you. Without you on Abyss Island, I can’t move a single step.” Ghost Granny pried open Elder Xie’s hand and promised.</p><p>“That’s good, that’s good. Remember what you said! Remember that you saved my life in the Blood World! Remember that I still owe you. It will be of great benefit to you if I’m alive!”</p><p>Elder Xie took a deep look at her and no longer hesitated. He took out a golden pill from his bosom and put it in his mouth.</p><p>The name “God’s Blessing” was very much like his devout heart at this moment. As soon as the power of the pill dissolved in his mouth, Elder Xie quickly began to make hand seals, and spiritual energy surged.</p><p>He closed his eyes.</p><p>The next second, he opened his eyes.</p><p>“Cursed Yin Eye, evil god possession!”</p><p>As soon as his deep voice fell, there was a bang, and an endless evil black-purple evil energy surged out of Elder Xie’s body.</p><p>The strange black-purple evil energy received the guidance of his will and instantly had a direction, madly piercing into the space between Elder Xie’s brows.</p><p>“Ahhh!”</p><p>A miserable shriek rang out as Elder Xie’s entire body spasmed, cracking and bleeding. He was in unspeakable pain.</p><p>Not long after, a purple mark split open in the middle of his forehead. As blood flowed, a black-purple eyeball bizarrely burst open from the middle.</p><p>In an instant, the world changed.</p><p>The entire world created by the Fantasy Sword Technique started to shake and crack, as if it couldn’t withstand such a terrifying level of power and was about to collapse.</p><p>“This is the power of the evil god.”</p><p>Ghost Granny was shocked and stopped. She glanced at the black-purple Cursed Yin Eye, knowing that it was impossible. She felt a sharp pain in her spirit and evil thoughts swam all over her body. She almost fell into cultivation deviation.</p><p>“How strange!”</p><p>The Cursed Yin Eye was too big.</p><p>It was the size of two babies’ fists, and it was filled with a crazy, twisted, and strange aura.</p><p>As soon as it appeared, it took up two-thirds of Elder Xie’s forehead, and it even pushed his eyebrows to the side.</p><p>Elder Xie’s entire face became strange and terrifying because of the appearance of the Cursed Yin Eye.</p><p>“Hahaha,” a bleak and tragic laugh came out of Elder Xie’s throat. His voice was clearly very low, but it sounded like thunder.</p><p>“Elder Xie, hold on!” Ghost Granny called out in a low voice, not daring to look at the Cursed Yin Eye again.</p><p>This voice seemed to have helped Elder Xie find his direction in the situation where his mind was filled with madness. He drooped silently, and his original eyeballs, which were pinned to the sides, trembled slightly before they regained focus.</p><p>“Cursed Yin Eye, break the delusion!”</p><p>Making a hand seal again, Elder Xie took this opportunity to recall his original intention of summoning the evil god to possess his body and began to find his way.</p><p>“This way!”</p><p>Soon, he turned to look behind him and pointed in that direction, shouting, “Go straight, don’t be affected by those tall buildings, they’re all fake! I don’t have much time left. I need to leave this damn place quickly and use Blood Escape!”</p><p>Elder Xie had never even thought of using the power of the evil god summoned by the Cursed Yin Eye to deal with Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>Putting aside the fact that he didn’t have much time left to maintain his rationality, Elder Xie didn’t know if he could match Xiao Kongtong with this power alone. He had never tried it before, and he didn’t want to try it now.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Grabbing Ghost Granny’s hand, Elder Xie felt that he was about to lose his mind. He wanted to use the last bit of his strength to let the two of them rush out of the world created by the Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>And after he rushed out, no matter how far he fled, it would have nothing to do with the unconscious him. It would all depend on whether Ghost Granny still wanted to help him.</p><p>“Yes, run, run with all your might, and risk your life!”</p><p>Ghost Granny responded to the words and was pulled by Elder Xie towards the city gate tower. She laughed as she spoke, “Then, let me see how far you can run.”</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Elder Xie who had just charged into the fake city tower suddenly stopped. He felt a chill rising all over his body and spurting out from the Cursed Yin Eye.</p><p>The voice…</p><p>This voice was a man’s voice!</p><p>He was still holding Ghost Granny’s hand, but he felt as if he was being pulled by the god of death. He turned around and used his delusion-breaker Cursed Yin Eye to see the person he had pulled over.</p><p>He was gentle and elegant, with a smile on his face. He held his right hand and held an illusionary Sword of the Space in his left hand. His squinted eyes were full of admiration.</p><p>“That’s pretty impressive. You can even borrow this kind of power. I knew that those who can reach the higher void level are not simple.”</p><p>“Xiao! Kong! Tong!”</p><p>Elder Xie had gone mad. His three eyes directly spewed out black-purple evil energy.</p><p>At this moment, countless images flashed through his mind.</p><p>Ghost Granny and Elder Xie clearly didn’t have the wrong eye contact or even have their backs facing each other. When did she get replaced?</p><p>That was impossible!</p><p>This was absolutely impossible!</p><p>This instant of the collapse was like the last straw that broke the camel’s back.</p><p>Elder Xie was already resisting the evil god’s will, and before his consciousness was completely wiped out by the evil thoughts of the Cursed Yin Eye, he suddenly came to a realization.</p><p>Yes, it was impossible after the Fantasy Sword Technique was activated.</p><p>But what about before it was launched?</p><p>One had to know that he and Ghost Granny had fallen into the trap at some point in time.</p><p>In that case, was it also possible that Ghost Granny had run far away and led the other “Elder Xie” to kill Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>“I’ll f*ck you!”</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, the Sword of the Space and the Mo Sword had already stabbed into Elder Xie’s Cursed Yin Eye.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>For a moment, black and purple evil energy and red blood energy gushed out at the same time.</p><p>“How dirty.”</p><p>After stabbing the sword in, Xiao Kongtong clapped his hands and retreated. He did not dare to look at the changes in the Cursed Yin Eye and jumped back into the Nine Heavens.</p><p>In the illusory giant kingdom, under the fake silver moon, only real black-purple waves were left. With Elder Xie as the center, they spread wildly in all directions, as if they were about to turn into an ocean of evil energy.</p><p>The screams that filled the evil purplish-black sea were twisted, crazy, and collapsing.</p><p>“Ahhhh!</p><p>“Ghost Granny, you’ve done me wrong!!!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
