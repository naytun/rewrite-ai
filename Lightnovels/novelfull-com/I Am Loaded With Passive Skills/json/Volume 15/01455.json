(Part 1)</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>With a flash of majestic power, the spiritual world seemed to have awakened Holy Light.</p><p>The kind will that had been devoured was awakened again. Xu Xiaoshou suddenly opened his eyes, as if someone had poured cold water on him.</p><p>He didn’t have the time to think about the situation. In the next second, he saw that the winged black demon Berserk Giant that it had turned into had devoured all the evil demons in his spiritual world!</p><p>It devoured all of them!</p><p>Not only did the deviated Berserk Giant eat the good side of itself, but it also ate all the evil formed from the other distracting thoughts in its heart.</p><p>Even if it was the Bazhun’an, even if it was Elder Sang’s, even if it was the demi-saint that was previously known to be invincible.</p><p>In the current situation where the good will thought that it was unrivaled, in the eyes of the evil will which was the master of the spiritual world that had indulged itself, these evil spirits were like paper.</p><p>Its only fate was to be eaten!</p><p>Devour, digest, grow…</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Taking over the winged black demon Berserk Giant that did not look like him but clearly belonged to his own spiritual body, Xu Xiaoshou was extremely shocked at the moment.</p><p>He felt that he had really split into two wills.</p><p>His body was clearly still in a state of cultivation deviation, killing intent was clearly surging in his mind, and the only desire he had was to devour.</p><p>However, there was still a trace of clarity in his spiritual altar, which allowed Xu Xiaoshou to still have strong control over his spiritual body, even though he had mastered the violent attribute power.</p><p>This feeling was like…</p><p>“I’ve been possessed by the devil, but it’s not a complete one. I can still think?”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>In just a moment, Xu Xiaoshou reacted.</p><p>Spirit Awakening!</p><p>As long as one’s mind was controlled, the power of the Disillusionment Finger would immediately trigger the Spirit Awakening.</p><p>As for cultivation deviation, it was equivalent to one’s good will being controlled by one’s evil will. Could this also trigger Spirit Awakening?</p><p>That’s right, wasn’t the appearance of the evil will also due to the intervention of external forces?</p><p>This situation led to Xu Xiaoshou’s current state. It was an extremely rare case where his spiritual body had entered a state of cultivation deviation. He had obtained the most destructive power, but his mind could still maintain complete clarity!</p><p>“Godless, faithless, and lawless… Isn’t this the same as letting loose the devil in his heart? The Heart Sword Technique is the only way to control this abomination.</p><p>“In other words, isn’t my current state highly compatible with the true meaning of the Heart Sword Technique?”</p><p>After realizing this, the Berserk Giant’s scarlet eyes suddenly bloomed with light.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused.</p><p>Fortune and misfortune always went hand in hand. He had never imagined that he would be able to continue training in the Heart Sword Technique in such a manner.</p><p>No one could have imagined this.</p><p>Even if he thought of it, he didn’t have the ability to do it!</p><p>He was the only one in the world who could do this!</p><p>The desire to indulge in everything was still wreaking havoc in his mind. Xu Xiaoshou was full of pride, and he no longer wanted to control this desire.</p><p>They were also a part of him, so why should he kill them?</p><p>Look, the spiritual will of the great enemies that he usually regarded as demons appeared. In his eyes, they were all weak chickens in his state of cultivation deviation and were eaten up in an instant.</p><p>Such a powerful force, why would he stop it from growing?</p><p>As long as he could hold on to his last bit of clarity and use the Heart Sword Technique to control the terrifying devil in his spiritual world, he could enter the Dao as a devil.</p><p>He wondered what kind of monster would he be able to visualize with such an ending.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t forget that in Master Siren’s teaching, the visualization of the Heart Sword Technique was to ‘unknown’ and ‘surpass’!</p><p>Then, what else was more suitable to be the “God” in the realm of “godless, faithless, and lawless” than Present Gods and Buddhas?</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The violent beast’s roar once again resounded through the entire chaotic spiritual world. This time, it was clearly filled with a tinge of joy.</p><p>After Xu Xiaoshou understood everything, he let go of all his desires. He wanted to see from a third-person perspective that ordinary people could not experience what kind of absurd things he would do in his cultivation deviation state.</p><p>The violent thoughts in his mind were still churning.</p><p>After devouring everything, the winged black demon Berserk Giant stared at the ancient giant in the distance without any hesitation.</p><p>The ancient giant from the fantasy realm that swallowed the mountains and rivers!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>With just a glance, Xu Xiaoshou could feel his most primitive thoughts: Eat!</p><p>Devour, digest, grow!</p><p>In the past, every time he recalled this ancient giant, Xu Xiaoshou’s first reaction would always be that he was under a mountain of pressure and unable to fight it.</p><p>Now that he had experienced cultivation deviation, this was the only thought left in his mind when he looked at the ancient giant again. He really wanted to kill the ancient giant and become a true godless, faithless, and lawless man.</p><p>It was ridiculous!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that it was ridiculous for him to have such thoughts, but then he was affected by the evil thoughts and felt that these thoughts were reasonable.</p><p>“That’s right. I’m the master in my spiritual world. Why should I be afraid of it?”</p><p>A mountain can not hold two tigers.</p><p>In his own spiritual world, how could a giant like him be so arrogant?</p><p>He was enough!</p><p>It had to be said that this absurdity came at just the right time, and it was exactly what the Heart Sword Technique needed.</p><p>Thus, when he looked up at the ancient giant again, Xu Xiaoshou had already begun to think of a plan to kill it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
