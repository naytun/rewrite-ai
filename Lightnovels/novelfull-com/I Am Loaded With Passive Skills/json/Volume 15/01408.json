How can you spoil things by your undue haste? Aren’t you afraid you’ll impart the wrong teachings to the child?” An ethereal and sweet voice came from the side. Even though the tone was reproachful, it made people feel at ease.</p><p>“Hehe, we don’t have time now. I still have to fight with Hua Changdeng tomorrow. I’ll have to teach him everything today.” The kidnapper didn’t seem to mind. He lowered his head and asked, “Little brat, did you remember everything?”</p><p>“Yes, I remember! Nine Major Sword Techniques, Eighteen Sword… huh? What was it again?”</p><p>…</p><p>The fragmented memories still flowed and Xiao Kongtong felt like he couldn’t hold on any longer.</p><p>At that moment, the kidnapper’s voice sounded again.</p><p>“When you step into the Way of the Sword, you can achieve it through ‘practice’. Your physique is destined to grow to a high level very soon. In their words, it is known as the Master Stage or Sovereign Stage.</p><p>“This is when we get to the most important part, the ‘enlightenment’ that I want to talk to you about.”</p><p>“How should I put it…?”</p><p>The kidnapper seemed to be at a loss for words and could only try his best to explain.</p><p>“The Path of Enlightenment is a very mysterious matter. In the future, when you open that book, some one will explain everything to you.”</p><p>“In short, this Path of Enlightenment can be said to be both profound and ordinary at the same time. Before you surpass me, you can understand it in this way.”</p><p>“The Swordsman Cultivation and the Spiritual Cultivation are all about getting closer to the Path and then become a Saint. However, they can’t become the ‘Path’ itself, nor can they be sucked into the death vortex by the Saint. It can only be said that it is infinitely close to perfection, but it is definitely not perfect. That itself is another kind of perfection!”</p><p>“Ahem, it’s hard to understand, isn’t it?”</p><p>“However, this might be difficult for others, but it would be very easy for you!”</p><p>The kidnapper said this calmly and suddenly he smiled brightly.</p><p>“You have a very outstanding Teacher. Before you surpass this Teacher, you can open the book I gave you and ponder on it.”</p><p>“I am the Path! The Saint is…”</p><p>…</p><p>Ka!</p><p>His head felt like it was about to split open.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was almost lost amid the chaos.</p><p>However, he still persisted. The words his Teacher said back then should be the key to help him break through this perplexity.</p><p>“But, I can’t remember…”</p><p>“I am the Path and the Saint is…? What is the Saint?”</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong had a splitting headache and blood seeped out of his seven orifices. He suddenly roared toward the sky as all his memories were wiped clean. The black and red Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree spread out and filled everything.</p><p>“I am the Path and the Saint is…’return’?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong seemed to have attained enlightenment. He stuck his hands into his chest, ready to rip himself apart.</p><p>But at this moment, the kidnapper appeared again.</p><p>He only had an illusory view from the back, but it seemed like his face was the one from his childhood days. His back clearly faced the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree as he gently explained.</p><p>“I am the Path and the Saint is…”</p><p>All of a sudden, as if he had sensed the existence of the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree behind him, which almost destroyed the consciousness of the child in front of him, the kidnapper suddenly turned around, raised his eyebrows and shouted.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>With a loud bang, the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree in his mind shattered.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s eyes cleared up and he regained his vision, but suddenly his pupils contracted.</p><p>“The Demi- Saint’s Mysterious Decree!”</p><p>“This is the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree!”</p><p>“The word ‘return’ has the power to break down all things and bring about chaos. You must not resist it!”</p><p>He grasped the sword that Master Siren slashed toward him, and suddenly spoke up, which shocked both Mei Siren and Ye Xiaotian tremendously.</p><p>“You can break free from the influence of the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree?” Mei Siren was stunned. This guy wasn’t Bazhun’an, how did he do it?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong heaved a sigh of relief when he realized that the two people in front of him had broken free of their restraints earlier than him.</p><p>But before he could completely relax, he seemed to recall something and suddenly looked back.</p><p>In the distance, under the influence of the Demi- Saint’s Mysterious Decree, everything had reverted to its original state!</p><p>The gigantic Stone Giants that had pursued him and Ye Xiaotian and who could be resurrected even if they were killed, fell to the ground one after another, and turned into primitive mountain ranges and melted into the Forest of Miracles.</p><p>The two Void Attendants who were among the Stone Giants had some intelligence. They had obviously lived for a long time and had a way to deal with it.</p><p>One of them crouched down, held his head and roared furiously to fight the pain in his head. The other one who did not even look at the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree followed suit and started to roar furiously.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou.. don’t look!” Xiao Kongtong wanted to get up, but he realized that he was too exhausted and could only give him a reminder.</p><p>However, as soon as he shouted, he saw a figure appear in the empty void under the influence of the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree.</p><p>Then as he came into contact with the Disappearing State, Xu Xiaoshou’s real body emerged and he clutched his head in pain as the ‘return’ appeared.</p><p>“Master Siren!” Xiao Kongtong’s heart clenched as he shouted.</p><p>Mei Siren also realized who Jiang Buyi’s target was this time. He immediately pulled out the stone sword and walked away.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou, who was in great pain, revealed his Morph Form in midair, which appeared as a blurry figure.</p><p>“Hahahaha!”</p><p>“So even you Bazhun’an are fake, and you dare to threaten me?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s consciousness that was left in the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree materialized. Before Mei Siren could make a move, he laughed hideously. His right arm, which had gathered endless Holy Power teleported and pierced through Xu Xiaoshou’s heart in a flash!</p><p>“I, the Saint have said that you only have two choices.”</p><p>“Either you come with this Saint and live a life of dignity, or you die a miserable death!”</p><p>Time seemed to have stopped at this moment.</p><p>Mei Siren took his sword and dashed over, but he was half a breath too late. Jiang Buyi looked back with a sinister smile. The image of his crazed expression and his hand that pierced through a person was deeply engraved in both Ye Xiaotian and Xiao Kongtong’s minds.</p><p>The Demi-Saint’s power erased all traces of the person in Jiang Buyi’s hands, just like how the Holy Light of Saints had erased Teng Shanhai.</p><p>Xu Xiashou had died?</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s lips quivered and his entire body convulsed.</p><p>At this moment he thought of Elder Sang and the last line in the last letter that the old man had left behind, “I’ll leave my silly disciple in your care.”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets. He lost his mind instantly. He rushed out of the Power Upanishad Formation and charged toward Jiang Buyi like a madman.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
