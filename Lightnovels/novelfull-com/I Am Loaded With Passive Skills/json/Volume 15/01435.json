After all, this force was too strong and rare in the world.</p><p>Other than Master Siren who could behead a Saint and even though he had not seen Xiao Kongtong’s combat strength, he thought that it should not be ordinary and should not be smaller than his big mouth.</p><p>When he had transformed into Water Ghost in the Deep Sea, he had seen the not-so-serious side of Xiao Kongtong. Xu Xiaoshou knew that this man was the big boss of the Fringe Moon Immortal City who had led a battle in the world and was in the prime of his life.</p><p>There was no need to talk about Ye Xiaotian as Xu Xiaoshou could already gauge the combat strength of this Master Dean when he compared him with Yu Lingdi, the Water-type Upanishad.</p><p>After all, between the Spatial Upanishad and the Water Upanishad, regardless of who was stronger or weaker, both would be at the peak of the world, right?</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s battle record was rather dismal; not only was he unable to defeat Bazhun’an, but he had also been abused by Yama Huang Quan.</p><p>However, this did not make the power of the Spatial Upanishad any lesser in Xu Xiaoshou’s heart. He was very clear that Ye Xiaotian was not the weak one, but that the two opponents he fought with were too abnormal and could not be understood with common sense.</p><p>Let’s put it this way!</p><p>If someone else had fought with those two, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know who could last as long as Master Dean did while he waited for the reinforcements to arrive.</p><p>“There’s a high chance that even the higher void level would be killed instantly. There’s no need to even think about the Sovereign Dao realm. None of them can fight.”</p><p>“As for whether or not he could hold on, or how long he could hold on, it’ll all depend on whether the two of them were willing to carry on. It has nothing to do with how strong the one being beaten is.” Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself.</p><p>The three of them exchanged glances before Ye Xiaotian took the lead to reply, “I probably won’t be staying on the Abyss Island. I have to go back to the Tiansang Spirit Palace first. Elder Qiao is still waiting for me at the Spirit Palace.”</p><p>Perhaps there were more opportunities on the Abyss Island, but Ye Xiaotian was no longer reluctant to leave.</p><p>He had even inexplicably obtained the Semi-Saint person, so what was there to miss here? What was left was only danger, right?</p><p>To Ye Xiaotian, there were two pressing matters at the moment.</p><p>One was cultivation.</p><p>The second was to quickly send Aje to Qiao Qianzhi to prevent any more trouble.</p><p>“Return?” Xu Xiaoshou was curious. “How will you return? Master Dean, you have a Void Token?”</p><p>Other than the Void Gate, the only other way to enter or exit the Abyss Island was through the Void Token.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou recalled that Ye Xiaotian had not been around at the Spirit Gem Trade Fair, so he should not have a Void Token, right?</p><p>“No, I don’t have one,” Ye Xiaotian shook his head decisively. “I plan to force my way across the spatial fragment and return to the Shengshen Continent and see if this method works.”</p><p>“Force your way?”</p><p>Not only was Xu Xiaoshou shocked by what he said, but Xiao Kongtong and Mei Siren were equally shocked.</p><p>“Yes, force my way through.” However, Ye Xiaotian seemed to have already made up his mind. “Don’t worry. To others, this may sound like a death wish. To me, the spatial fragment between the Abyss Island and the Shengshen continent is just a bit of a challenge. The ordinary stuff can’t hold me back anymore.”</p><p>He paused for a while and then added, “I’ve tried many times in the Shengshen Continent. I can’t come and go as I please. I encountered some obstacles.”</p><p>It was only then that the other three suddenly recalled that Ye Xiaotian had cultivated the Spatial Upanishad.</p><p>“You won’t die, will you?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou still felt that this matter was too mysterious.</p><p>The Abyss Island and the Shengshen Continent were indeed two different worlds!</p><p>What Master Dean wanted to do was even more difficult than if he had ripped open a spatial rift in the Shengshen Continent and then teleported to a different extradimensional space, such as the White Cave!</p><p>“Shut your jinxed mouth!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian glared at Xu Xiaoshou before he turned to look at Mei Siren and Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>“You two, I’ll take my leave first. If this trip is a success, it will be more precious than any treasure to me who has the Space Attributes.”</p><p>“After all, the appearance of the Abyss Island is a once-in-a-thousand-years event. It’s the dream of any Spiritual Cultivator with Space Attributes.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s mouth was agape and his face was filled with disbelief. In the end, he could not say anything to dissuade him, so he nodded and said, “It must be very exciting. If I had the Space Attributes, I might have made the same choice. Take care.”</p><p>Mei Siren closed his folding fan and felt that he had also seen the difference between a Spiritual Cultivator and an Ancient Swordsman. He smiled and said, “This is indeed an opportunity. I wish you success.”</p><p>“Goodbye.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian bade farewell to the two of them as he formed a Power Upanishad Formation beneath his feet. Finally, he glared at Xu Xiaoshou, raised a finger and said, “Remember, don’t cause any trouble! I’ll take my leave first, see you later.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand numbly and thought, “Master Dean, you’re even crazier than me.”</p><p>“Take care,” he said.</p><p>But in the end, he could only watch Master Dean leave.</p><p>With one of the three bodyguards gone, Xu Xiaoshou could only look at the other two.</p><p>“You both…”</p><p>“What about you? Where are you headed for?” Xiao Kongtong asked in return. He would not travel with Xu Xiaoshou, as this was an order from his Teacher.</p><p>In order for the young eagle to grow, it had to learn how to fly by itself.</p><p>Once they had someone to rely on, their growth would more or less be affected.</p><p>Therefore, Xiao Kongtong would only try to appear when Xu Xiaoshou was in trouble, but he agreed with his Teacher and would definitely not go with Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou noted the countdown in his mind and his face became aggrieved.</p><p>He had originally wanted to follow Lei Xi’er with the guidance of the Flame Python to look for the treasure, but now it seemed that he had to go to another place in order to get rid of the countdown.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
