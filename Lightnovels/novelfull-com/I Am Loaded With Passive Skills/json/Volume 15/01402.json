If he didn’t have such abilities, he would have died in all the disputes in the past.</p><p>Hearing this, he only smiled and stretched out his right hand with only four fingers left. Then, he raised his index finger and shook it gently, “No, no, no, Jiang Buyi… I think you misunderstood what I meant. What I really want to say is that if you use your Holy Power again, you’ll be marked by the spirit of Abyss Island and fall into the Inner Island. Even if you exhaust a lifetime of eggs, you won’t know how to survive in that place!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong narrowed his eyes, and a cold glint flashed in his murky eyes. The aura of sword cognition spread out from his body, and the corners of his mouth curled up into a sneer.</p><p>“Come out? Ha!” Xiao Kongtong snorted, “You want to leave the Inner Island of Abyss Island with your insignificant demi-saint cultivation? You’re dreaming!”</p><p>When the last two words were uttered, Ye Xiaotian’s heart almost stopped beating.</p><p>His eyelids twitched wildly, and his heart was in chaos.</p><p>This was crazy!</p><p>This guy was crazy!</p><p>Wasn’t he over-acting? Did Xiao Kongtong really think he was a teacher? As long as Jiang Buyi could not help but make a move, how would he deal with it?</p><p>The calamity cloud of thunder and fire in the Nine Heavens was also stunned and didn’t move.</p><p>The undisguised mockery in the Bazhun’an’s words instantly ignited the demi-saint’s anger, just like how he had been scolded by Teng Shanhai and spat on back then.</p><p>Jiang Buyi could not bear it at all!</p><p>However…</p><p>“He’s Bazhun’an! Someone who managed to escape from the Inner Island of Abyss Island! Behind him is the Seven Sword Deity Mei Siren who just killed my demi-saint incarnation with one sword…”</p><p>As such, no matter how furious he was, Jiang Buyi used his rationality to calm down his impulse. Since the target was different, he could not vent his anger.</p><p>Even one Mei Siren was too much for him to handle.</p><p>With the addition of Bazhun’an whose combat strength was unknown, how could he take them on?</p><p>“You want to fight?” Xiao Kongtong acted as if he didn’t see the final suppression of the calamity cloud of thunder and fire in the Nine Heavens and only saw the momentary restlessness just now.</p><p>He raised his brows and laughed, “To tell you the truth, Master Siren’s sword move just now made me very eager to make a move. He still has two more swords to unleash… Unfortunately, I’m not that good and I only have one sword move. Jiang Buyi, do you want to take it?”</p><p>God knows if Jiang Buyi wanted to receive the sword move, but Ye Xiaotian felt that he could not hold on any longer.</p><p>Was this guy acting, or was he really itching for a fight after watching the sword?</p><p>Did he know his own worth? How dare he speak to a demi-saint like this?</p><p>Mei Siren was also stunned.</p><p>Wasn’t Bazhun’an here to stop the fight? Why did he suddenly want to fight?</p><p>He didn’t want to fight anymore… Mei Siren was full of reluctance, but since the words have come to this point, if he didn’t stand up and support, it would be his fault for not giving the other party face.</p><p>As a result, Mei Siren took a step forward, and the killing intent that he had restrained reappeared.</p><p>The calamity cloud of thunder and fire in the Nine Heavens surged crazily as if it could not contain its desire to attack. No one knew what choice the infuriated demi-saint Jiang Buyi would make.</p><p>“Bazhun’an,” In less than three breaths, the calamity cloud of thunder and fire stopped rolling, and a deep voice drifted down, “What did you just say?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was slightly startled. Hearing this low tone, did Jiang Buyi really want to fight?</p><p>Xiao Kongtong himself did not want to fight!</p><p>However, he knew that using a shield to defend against a spear would only lead to the spear’s even more frenzied attacks.</p><p>Therefore, he decided to first use peaceful means before resorting to force, then taking the initiative to attack the other party’s “shield” with his “spear”, trying to use the sharpest and most offensive words to force Jiang Buyi to retreat.</p><p>If the teacher himself came, he would also say and do the same thing. It was impossible for him to take a step back!</p><p>The choice was up to the opponent… Either way, he was respected as Bazhun’an, and he could take whatever the result was!</p><p>But looking at the situation now, his words seemed to have the opposite effect.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong did not reveal any of his inner emotions, and instead, his fighting spirit soared. Sword cultivators of his generation would press forward with an indomitable will!</p><p>“Jiang Buyi, do you dare to fight?” He shouted coldly.</p><p>Everyone was solemn. It seemed that the curtains to a great battle that would surpass the previous ones were about to open.</p><p>However, at this moment, the face of Jiang Buyi, which had transformed into a calamity cloud of thunder and fire in the Nine Heavens, shook slightly. He said calmly, “I’m not asking about that. I’m asking about your previous sentence.”</p><p>“The previous sentence?” Xiao Kongtong was slightly startled. After a while, he seemed to understand something.</p><p>The corner of his mouth twitched, and he said in surprise, “Give me some face?”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The dark clouds that covered the Forest of Miracles suddenly receded and turned back into Jiang Buyi’s true form. He stood proudly with his hands behind his back and looked down from above.</p><p>Then, he said calmly, “That’s the sentence. I’ll give you face.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
