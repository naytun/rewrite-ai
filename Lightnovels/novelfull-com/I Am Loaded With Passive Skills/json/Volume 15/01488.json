Xu Xiaoshou was this kind of person.</p><p>But sometimes, seeing was not necessarily better than not seeing.</p><p>For some existences, once you discovered them, karma would begin to form, such as meeting the Saint.</p><p>Facing the unknown was the same as facing the Saint. Most of the time, if you didn’t get a good result, you would only end up in a very miserable state. This was because the Saint cannot be blasphemed. The unknown was the same!</p><p>According to the portrait of Xu Xiaoshou, the void general was a semi-saint person.</p><p>Mei Siren was thinking that such a powerful existence, even after such a long time of decay, still had a demi-saint aura that could be traced by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>How terrifying was it when it was alive?</p><p>It couldn’t be provoked!</p><p>“Let’s go first.” Mei Siren glanced at Xiao Kongtong and received an affirmative look from him. He was about to leave with Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>However, at this moment, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t move his feet, and his eyes even showed reluctance.</p><p>With a thump, Mei Siren instantly understood this boy’s bold idea. His thinking had never been related to the word normal!</p><p>“Don’t mess around!”</p><p>“Even if it still has a ‘spirit’, it’s not something you can form a contract with at this level.”</p><p>Mei Siren directly hit him with his paper fan.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou dodged it. He turned around and said seriously, “Teacher, trust me. I value my life more than you do.”</p><p>“How can this old man believe you!” Mei Siren’s face was filled with anger.</p><p>He was playing with his life!</p><p>He couldn’t see what Xu Xiaoshou had seen, so how could he ensure the safety of this student?</p><p>For a beginner of the Phantom Swords Technique to make a contract with a spirit of such a terrifying existence, let alone success, Mei Siren could only think of a hundred ways to kill Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Teacher,” Xu Xiaoshou held Master Siren’s hand. His eyes were clear without any impurities. He just looked at him seriously without saying anything.</p><p>Mei Siren’s eyes turned cold, and he almost cursed out loud. However, when he met Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze, he could only feel helpless in the end.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was indeed an impulsive person. He even dared to play with a demi-saint.</p><p>However, he was indeed very self-aware. His means were strong enough to fool a demi-saint with his Master Stage cultivation.</p><p>“You’re confident?” Mei Siren glanced at the void general in the distance and asked in a low voice.</p><p>“At least I know when I’m going to die,” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t answer directly. “And it’s not now!”</p><p>He didn’t look at Master Siren anymore and took out the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale.</p><p>“Risky, risky, risky!”</p><p>“What’s the risk of me contracting this thing? Will I die? Will I die? Answer me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sent a few thoughts back and forth in his mind, trying to let the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale see his heart and predict danger in advance.</p><p>“Bang, bang!”</p><p>The Holy Emperor Dragon Scale rang.</p><p>There was the sound of a heartbeat, and it was very heavy.</p><p>But it was not as heavy as the super impact of the meeting with the Saint, nor was it as fast as the frequency of that time.</p><p>This meant that…</p><p>“Opportunity coexists with danger!”</p><p>After saying this, Xu Xiaoshou no longer cared about Mei Siren and Xiao Kongtong. Under Ghost Granny’s trembling gaze, he walked to the front of the portrait of the void general.</p><p>He didn’t squat down, because even when he was standing, he was shorter than the half-squatting void general.</p><p>But even in such a horrifying and strange street background, Xu Xiaoshou still fearlessly reached out his hand to the general in blood-red armor with a two-handed sword in his chest and a cold will-o-wisp burning in his eyes.</p><p>“Hey, void general, stop kneeling and follow me.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
