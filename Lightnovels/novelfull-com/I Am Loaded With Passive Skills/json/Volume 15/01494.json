After all, the medicinal herb field was rich, and the Breathing Technique wouldn’t waste any medicinal strength. Transformation would also turn it into an improvement in other aspects.</p><p>As for the final step, it would depend on the method used to enter the Dao.</p><p>This matter was not urgent. Xu Xiaoshou had made comprehensive arrangements for his Sovereign Dao Realm. He had already waited for so long, so he would not mind the little time left.</p><p>Looking at Master Siren, Xu Xiaoshou clenched his fist and asked thoughtfully, “The powerful spirit soul of the Red Ghost Inscription can return a lot of power in various aspects?”</p><p>“That’s right!” Mei Siren nodded without hesitation. “But first, you have to survive the consumption of the contract. The stronger the spirit soul, the greater the consumption. Hmm, it’s obvious that you’ve survived the consumption.”</p><p>As Mei Siren spoke, he felt a sense of powerlessness.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s physique was too strong!</p><p>It wouldn’t cause cultivation deviation, and it wouldn’t consume… Was the Sovereign Physique really that powerful? This was practically assisting the rapid growth of his main cultivation path in all aspects.</p><p>At this moment, even Mei Siren was considering whether he should also cultivate his physical strength. It was simply beneficial and without any disadvantages!</p><p>“How do you feel now? Do you need some rest?” Mei Siren asked after a moment of silence. “Do you need rest?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head. Why did he need to rest when he was in his prime?</p><p>“Master Siren, I won’t be learning the Spirits Controlling for now. After the contract is successful, I feel that I can already fight with Ghost Granny.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Ghost Granny and said what he thought would sound very arrogant to others.</p><p>However, with Hong around, all of this was really just confidence, not arrogance.</p><p>“Ha!”</p><p>Ghost Granny sneered and met Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes. She suppressed her trembling heart and wanted to say something.</p><p>He had only just completed the three main thresholds of cultivating the Phantom Swords Technique. Where did he get the confidence that he could be compared to her, who had decades of experience in the Dao of the soul?</p><p>However, before she could speak, she heard Mei Siren beside Xu Xiaoshou sigh and say helplessly,</p><p>“The most basic requirement to master Spirits Controlling is to form the Red Ghost Inscription, not to mention that you’ve already completed the contract with your spirit soul.</p><p>“You have already learned the first realm of the Phantom Swords Technique, Spirits Controlling…”</p><p>Ghost Granny’s face froze.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was also stunned and turned to look at him.</p><p>“Ah? Was it that simple? I clearly haven’t done anything yet…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
