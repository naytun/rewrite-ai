However, there was no one here, so who knew what the screams were?</p><p>Elder Xie and Ghost Granny stayed close to each other. They didn’t even dare to turn their backs to each other or even look at each other. At all times, they could at least see each other from the corner of their eyes and not mistake each other for someone else.</p><p>When they found out that the fella who trapped them with the Fantasy Sword Technique was the Eldest Senior Brother from the Fringe Moon Immortal City, they were already terrified.</p><p>However, even in this situation, the two of them were experienced killers and could always find a way to deal with the illusion.</p><p>If a person was trapped in an illusion, they would be able to walk out of the illusion by guarding their heart and breaking through the array eye.</p><p>When many people were under the illusion, if they couldn’t find the array eye and break it, then the most terrible thing was no longer their powerlessness, but the fantasy realm itself.</p><p>As long as one’s gaze shifted, no one would know if the companion beside them had been replaced under the influence of the master of the fantasy realm.</p><p>As long as the two of them had their backs to each other, no one knew if the fellow behind them, who was supposed to be their companion, would become a ferocious monster.</p><p>Or perhaps, his companions had already died, and what remained by his side had always been an illusion created by the fantasy realm.</p><p>This kind of horrifying and terrifying thing was the meaning of the existence of high-level fantasy realms.</p><p>If a person’s defense was torn open from the heart and spirit, and their mind was lost, victory or defeat would be decided in a single thought, even if they were of the same level and generation.</p><p>Even Elder Xie and Ghost Granny didn’t think that the two of them combined could be compared to the Eldest Senior Brother of Fringe Moon Immortal City, who had single-handedly ruled the entire Eastern Moon Realm!</p><p>“Impossible, absolutely impossible. I’ve already used so many methods. How can it still be on this street?!”</p><p>After letting out a horrified shriek, Elder Xie’s eyes drooped like a dead fish’s as he stared at Ghost Granny listlessly. He shook his head and said in a panic,</p><p>“The smiling handsome guy is the array eye, so we can’t defeat him and break the array eye.”</p><p>“Since that’s the case, there are only two ways to deal with illusions. Influence the environment, find the flaws in the subtle places, and then return to reality and stick to your own heart. As long as the spiritual body doesn’t sink into the illusions he creates, you can always find an opportunity to grasp the boundary between reality and illusion and return to reality.</p><p>“I’m not wrong about these two, am I?”</p><p>Elder Xie held his head and pressed his hands against his temples. His face was so pale that it was as if he had been soaked in water for a few days. The time that had passed in the fantasy realm was only a moment, but he felt as if every day was a year. He was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>“You’re right, but don’t forget that what Xiao Kongtong used isn’t a simple ‘illusionary technique’, but a Fantasy Sword Technique!” Ghost Granny’s eyes darted left and right, as if she was scared of the wind. As she spoke, she reached out to scratch her face and skin.</p><p>This was not a sign of poisoning, but a characteristic unique to her. After being nervous, her entire body would itch, and she had to use this action to soothe her inner emotions.</p><p>Elder Xie’s upper eyelids were still half-closed as he watched Ghost Granny scratch her ugly face until it was red and white. Some parts of her skin were even bleeding, and even the clothes she had just changed out of were torn, revealing the wrinkles that covered her whole body and the black spots on her skin.</p><p>This scene was even more horrifying than the illusion itself.</p><p>If he had not been Ghost Granny’s assassin partner for so many years, Elder Xie would have thought that this was a fake monster created by Xiao Kongtong to break through his inner defenses.</p><p>However, it was these details that made him convinced that the fantasy realm itself was safe, but at least his companion was fine. Ghost Granny was still Ghost Granny and had not been switched.</p><p>“I can’t take it anymore!”</p><p>Elder Xie held his head so hard that it seemed like his hand was going to burst it. He desperately pressed against his temple and said in a deep voice, ”</p><p>“We’ve tried more than ten different methods, but none of them worked. He’s just deliberately showing us flaws. He’s just playing with the dogs!</p><p>“But! But! Don’t panic, we can’t panic!”</p><p>When Elder Xie thought of this, he calmed down a little. He shook his head and continued,</p><p>“It’s obvious that he’s stalling because he doesn’t have the confidence to deal with the two of us at the same time.</p><p>“That’s obvious, isn’t it? We’re both at the higher void level, and Xiao Kongtong is at the peak of the higher void level. With the two of us together, we can exchange our lives for his. When that time comes, neither of us will have an easy time.</p><p>“Since that’s the case, he just wants to wait for his companions to come over…</p><p>“It’s definitely not Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Elder Xie seemed to be giving himself confidence. The more he spoke, the clearer his thoughts became. His voice also gradually became stronger, and his tone became more certain.</p><p>“He’s waiting for that old man, that guy… When they come, we all have to die!”</p><p>Ghost Granny scratched her chest with both hands. After hearing these incoherent words, her eyes moved left and right at a faster rate. She asked vaguely, “You know that old man?”</p><p>“Who the f*ck would know?!” Elder Xie roared as if he had gone mad. He pointed at Ghost Granny and started scolding, “You can’t even recognize your own Spiritual Banner. You also can’t recognize Xiao Kongtong. You’re asking me to charge ahead? You’re really sick!”</p><p>“I’m indeed sick!” Ghost Granny was stunned by the scolding and muttered. Then she reacted and flew into a rage. “Do you know him? The Eldest Senior Brother of the Fringe Moon Immortal City has hundreds and thousands of portraits scattered outside. How many times have you been to the Eastern Region? Have you seen his face in person? In this situation, if you were in my place, would you recognize him?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
