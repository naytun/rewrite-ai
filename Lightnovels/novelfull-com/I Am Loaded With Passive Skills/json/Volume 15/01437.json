However, Reverend Huang Yang had turned around and rushed into the midst of the Blood Sea, dug out this blood-colored bead, and then successfully escaped with the two of them.</p><p>It had to be said that this Daoist priest was really greedy!</p><p>However, he succeeded in his greed. Ghost Granny was impressed and told him. Under these circumstances, her life mattered more. It would have been impossible for her to turn back!</p><p>“Ha.” Reverend Huang Yang only chuckled when he heard this. “The two of you have escaped from death and even managed to obtain the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch. If I ran out with you without getting anything, wouldn’t I have wasted this life-and-death trip?”</p><p>Elder Xie laughed eerily, but his attention was not diverted. He continued to stare at the blood bead with a burning gaze and said, “So, what is this?”</p><p>“I’m not sure,” Reverend Huang Yang shook his head, “I can’t get the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch, but I had to find something, right?” Although I don’t know what it is, I can feel that it is at least a treasure at the higher void level. Who knows, once I figure out its use, I might be able to obtain a Saint opportunity from it?”</p><p>“Hey!” After a self-mocking remark, Reverend Huang Yang put away the bead and laughed, “Actually, if we really want to do a comparison, my bead is definitely not as good as your Blood Tree’s Yin Branch, but it’s better than nothing, isn’t it?”</p><p>Elder Xie and Ghost Granny laughed at the same time.</p><p>These words were certainly true. The Blood Tree’s Yin Branch had been broken off from the Blood Tree, one of the Nine Great Ancestral Trees. The increase in combat strength was extremely terrifying.</p><p>What could be better than this in this world?</p><p>When they saw that Reverend Huang Yang did not elaborate further, the two assassins didn’t ask any more questions.</p><p>After they recovered from the previous horrifying experience, Elder Xie sized up the unfamiliar ancient city and asked, “So, what are your plans now?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
