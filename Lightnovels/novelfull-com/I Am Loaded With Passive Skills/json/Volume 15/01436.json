After moving the … er, I mean, pulling out some Spiritual Herbs from the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, a ‘death countdown’ appeared in my mind. Only the ‘Death Exemption Token’ from the First Hall of Sins can get rid of this thing.”</p><p>As soon as he said this, Xu Xiaoshou thought that the two people in front of him would ask what a ‘death countdown’ was. Unexpectedly, the two of them were equally stunned.</p><p>“Countdown?” Xiao Kongtong was shocked. “Are you talking about the ‘countdown’ of the ‘exiled list’?”</p><p>“Right!” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up. “You know about that?”</p><p>“As expected of you, Fringe Moon Immortal City’s big mouth. You really know a lot of secrets. Quick, tell me how to break this thing other than to use the Death Exemption Token.”</p><p>Before Xu Xiaoshou could blurt out what was on his mind, Xiao Kongtong’s expression became very strange. “It’s not ‘I know’, it’s ‘I have it too’.”</p><p>“What do you have too?” Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t react for a moment.</p><p>“The countdown!” Xiao Kongtong’s tone turned serious. “Eight days!”</p><p>“Ha?”</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded.</p><p>“You have a countdown too?”</p><p>“You have eight days left, too?”</p><p>“What did you do? I was only punished because I emptied the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer. You’ve stolen a Semi-Saint person. You’re even more excessive than me.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly understood something.</p><p>As it turned out, as long as one did something outrageous on the Abyss Island, they would be marked and their death countdown would start ticking.</p><p>“I was planning to find the city gate of this Sky City and run away in eight days. What do you mean by First Hall of Sins and Death Exemption Token?” Xiao Kongtong felt excited, as if he had found another way out.</p><p>If he could, he did not want to leave the Abyss Island. After all, it was full of opportunities and battles.</p><p>“You know even less than I do.” Xu Xiaoshou felt helpless and couldn’t help but ask, “Do you have a Void Token?”</p><p>“Uh-huh” Xiao Kongtong nodded, and with a flip of his hand, took out a black Void Token.</p><p>“But there’s only one. Do you want it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“I want it!” He immediately nodded.</p><p>“I won’t give it to you even if you want it.” Xiao Kongtong put it away smugly. “Tell me something about that First Hall of Sins.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was infuriated. He regretted selling all his Void Tokens at the Spirit Gem Trade Fair.</p><p>However, since Water Ghost and Bazhun’an dared to send him to this Abyss Island, they probably wouldn’t let him die here.</p><p>If he really got hold of the Void Token, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he would not leave immediately.</p><p>After all, Water Ghost was right. Opportunity and risk coexisted. The Abyss Island was indeed an opportunity that came only once in a million years.</p><p>“I don’t know much either. I just heard from the Void Attendant that Void Crystals are the only ‘currency’ that are circulated on the Abyss Island. It can be exchanged for the Death Exemption Token in the First Hall of Sins. This should be able to get rid of the ‘death countdown’ in our minds.” Xu Xiaoshou said.</p><p>“Void Crystals…” Xiao Kongtong pondered over this. Suddenly, he thought of the last time in the Forest of Miracles when Xu Xiaoshou had transformed into a Void Attendant and made a dirty deal with the real Void Attendant.</p><p>His pupils dilated and he said in surprise, “Was that the one you got from the Void Attendant the last time?”</p><p>“Ah?” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes became confused. Then, as if he recalled something, he shook his head and said, “No, you’re wrong. That was just a parting gift from it.”</p><p>“So that’s how it is…” Xiao Kongtong glanced at Xu Xiaoshou with suspicion. He looked again and still did not believe him. His eyebrows immediately shot up and his expression turned cold. “It’d better not be!”</p><p>“Haha…” Xu Xiaoshou laughed. His eyes darkened and he looked elsewhere.</p><p>“What a joke!”</p><p>“You won’t even give me your Void Token, and you still want to get hold of my Void Crystals?”</p><p>“That’s a gift from my good friend! If I were to give it to you and the Void Attendant finds out about it, what would I do?”</p><p>Suddenly, Xu Xiaoshou fixed his eyes on the Sword Deity, Mei Siren, who remained silent and listened to their conversation with a profound expression.</p><p>He hesitated for a moment and asked casually, “Master Siren, don’t tell me you have a death timer as well? The fight between you and Demi-Saint Jiang destroyed half of the Forest of Miracles!”</p><p>“Yes.” Mei Siren nodded gently.</p><p>This shocked both Xu Xiaoshou and Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“What? Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. So, not only thieves, but vandals were also marked?</p><p>“How many days do you have left?”</p><p>“Ten days.” Mei Siren remained calm. “I’m on some ‘exile list’, just like you guys.”</p><p>As expected…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked, but he also felt that it was natural.</p><p>He had only emptied a part of the Herb Garden, but Master Siren had fought with Demi-Saint Jiang and destroyed almost the entire Forest of Miracles. In the end, he had even activated the Ultimate Attribute there, which created havoc in the area. This should have been marked, right?</p><p>However, it was a little awkward.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Master Siren’s calm face and felt a little angry.</p><p>“It’s already the ‘death countdown’, how can you still be so nonchalant about it? If he had not asked, would he really not have said anything?”</p><p>“You’re not panicking?” Xu Xiaoshou gritted his teeth and felt a toothache coming.</p><p>“What’s the use of panicking? Since it has already happened, it’s time to resolve it. Isn’t it like what you said : First Hall of Sins, Void Crystal, Death Exemption Token.” Mei Siren smiled.</p><p>“Are you guys trying to get me to tear my hair out!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou broke down. He had only managed to get 60 Void Crystals from the Void Attendant after much difficulty. In addition to the two he had obtained from the previous mission, he had a total of 62 Void Crystals.</p><p>He didn’t even know if this amount was enough to exchange for a Death Exemption Token.</p><p>“Great, now I have to exchange them for the three of us?”</p><p>“We’re all on our own here.” Xu Xiaoshou suddenly wanted to say this and part ways with the two people in front of him.</p><p>But he instantly realized that he had been too narrow-minded.</p><p>“That’s too stupid!”</p><p>If he could travel with these two, he could just rob the Void Attendant directly. Why would he need to worry about not having enough Void Crystals?</p><p>“Seniors, since we’re all going to die soon, why don’t we all go together to the First Hall of Sins and look for a solution?” Xu Xiaoshou’s head swiveled back and forth, and he wanted to reach out and start to tug their woolen clothes.</p><p>“Sure.” Mei Siren actually nodded and agreed!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly turned to look at Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>At this moment, the image of Ye Xiaotian’s dazed state when he initially left the First Hall of Sins flashed through Xiao Kongtong’s mind. It was clear that that place was very terrifying!</p><p>Then, he recalled the Teacher’s order that he could not travel with Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>The next second, he also nodded along with Master Siren, “That’s for sure. We’re in the same boat, so we can take care of each other.”</p><p>“Teacher, it’s not that I don’t want to follow your orders, but if Master Siren went along with Xu Xiaoshou, it would not matter if I join him, right?”</p><p>Master Siren had agreed so quickly, and from the Forest of Miracles had gone straight toward Xu Xiaoshou. It was obvious what the old man’s purpose was. Xu Xiaoshou was so stupid that he hadn’t realized it yet.</p><p>“If you don’t have the time to teach me, I’ll follow you and secretly learn. There shouldn’t be a problem, right?”</p><p>“Hmm, I’ll extract its essence and remove its dregs… that Sword Image must have many shortcomings. I’ll definitely find out the nature of the problems!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s thoughts raced.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was overjoyed. He didn’t expect to get two super bodyguards all because of a ‘death countdown’.</p><p>“How was this a ‘death countdown’? This was a life-saving charm!”</p><p>If the Abyss Island could bury Master Siren and the Fringe Moon Immortal City’s Eldest Senior Brother, Xu Xiaoshou felt that it was no big deal for him to be buried with them.</p><p>“Then let’s go!” Xu Xiaoshou turned his head and pursed his lips. “Shall we head to the First Hall of Sins immediately?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong did not move and turned his head to look at Mei Siren, who seemed to be waiting for something.</p><p>“There’s no rush.”</p><p>Mei Siren smiled. As soon as he finished speaking, he slowly pulled out the two stone swords from behind him, which were still intact even after the battle at the Demi-Saint level.</p><p>He handed one of them to Xu Xiaoshou and finally asked the question he had wanted to ask so eagerly after he had rushed to the Forest of Miracles from the Absolute Ember Fire Domain and fought with a Demi-Saint.</p><p>Before this question, even the ‘death countdown’ had to be delayed a little.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, do you want to learn how to use the sword?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
