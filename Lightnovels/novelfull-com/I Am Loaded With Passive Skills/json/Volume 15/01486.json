He had really seen something that shouldn’t have been seen.</p><p>However, who here wasn’t an expert in the Dao of the soul?</p><p>There was no need to talk about Ghost Granny. Even if she didn’t dare to claim to be a peak expert in the Dao of the soul, the power of the cornmeal soul escape was still accumulating in her soul body. For a short time, she could burst out a soul attack that was almost on par with the head of a foreign tribe.</p><p>Naturally, this was accompanied by an increase in her spiritual sense. However, when she turned around, she still couldn’t see anything.</p><p>It was the same for Mei Siren and Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>As mighty figures who had all practiced the Phantom Swords Technique and mastered the first realm of the Phantom Swords Technique, Spirits Controlling, what ghost in the world would they not be able to see with the Ghost Inscription?</p><p>However, what Xu Xiaoshou was pointing at and talking about was only air in their eyes!</p><p>“Don’t mess around,” Mei Siren frowned, thinking that Xu Xiaoshou was trying to scare Ghost Granny. “Now is not the time to joke.”</p><p>Startled, Passive Points, +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was scared of himself.</p><p>He thought the three people present could also see what he saw. He never thought that he seemed to be the special one.</p><p>“I… I’m not joking…” Xu Xiaoshou subconsciously took a few steps back and retreated behind Master Siren. “You guys, you really don’t see it?”</p><p>“What did you see?” Mei Siren’s expression turned serious.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou swallowed his saliva and didn’t answer directly. Instead, he asked, “It can’t be that the only spirits you can summon are those weak spirits like sand, moss, and dust, right?”</p><p>Mei Siren choked for a moment, but he quickly clenched his paper fan tightly and suppressed the urge to blow Xu Xiaoshou’s head up. “What do you mean?!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong suddenly looked around and felt that the night wind was a little cold. The moon above his head had directly changed into the sun.</p><p>Only then did Ghost Granny feel a little better. She felt warm, and that obscure and invisible thing seemed to have disappeared.</p><p>“It’s gone,” Xu Xiaoshou was also stunned. He stared behind Ghost Granny and then looked around. He looked thoughtfully at Xiao Kongtong and said, “Eldest Senior Brother, why don’t you try cutting it into a moon?”</p><p>Don’t do this… Xiao Kongtong felt a chill in his heart, but after glancing at Master Siren, he could only grit his teeth helplessly and change the environment of the fantasy realm to nightfall.</p><p>The moon rose again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou trembled and pointed behind Ghost Granny, shouting in surprise, “It’s here. Can’t you see? You’re trying to fool me, they’re out again!”</p><p>They?</p><p>This time, Mei Siren’s body also trembled. Finally, he couldn’t hold it in anymore. With a bang, he knocked the paper fan down on Xu Xiaoshou. “Don’t talk nonsense!”</p><p>Ghost Granny’s heart went cold. She felt that the fear she had lost for many years after cultivating the Dao of the soul was finally back.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s gaze was swift, his pupils moving up, down, left, and right in an irregular manner. Even the Red Ghost Inscription between his brows appeared, but he still could not find anything.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath.</p><p>He really wasn’t joking. There was no need to.</p><p>He finally confirmed that he was the only one who could see these things.</p><p>“Arms, thighs, and meat, it’s this big!” Xu Xiaoshou drew a big circle in the air with his arm and said in a creepy voice,</p><p>“This is obviously the incomplete body of a giant.</p><p>“There are also damaged weapon spirits, but I can’t summon their spirits. It’s as if they’ve been eroded by time, and only large traces are left behind. These are clearly their weapons…</p><p>“And this…”</p><p>As he spoke, he fixed his gaze on Ghost Granny’s pale face. Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze stopped behind her, and his Adam’s apple bobbed.</p><p>“How should I describe this?”</p><p>With a swoosh.</p><p>Before he could start, Ghost Granny suddenly disappeared from her original position and stood in a different place.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s lips twitched. He looked over and said, “You, you stepped on its head!”</p><p>Ghost Granny was speechless.</p><p>She really thought that Xu Xiaoshou was threatening her.</p><p>But at this moment, she really couldn’t hold back the fear in her heart, and she took a small step to the side.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face turned green. “I told you, it’s a giant! Now that you’ve stepped on his eyeballs, you’re really impolite!”</p><p>Ghost Granny’s expression instantly lost control. With a strange cry, she rose into the air and went to Xiao Kongtong’s side.</p><p>The world was so big, but she actually felt that there was no place for her.</p><p>This was too terrifying!</p><p>What did Xu Xiaoshou just see?</p><p>“Speak!” Mei Siren sucked in a breath of cold air and said heavily.</p><p>“I can’t explain it clearly. I’ll just draw it for you.” Xu Xiaoshou blinked hard.</p><p>After he came to his senses, he moved his hand, and Drawing Expertise drew out all the scenes he had seen on this Long Street since he activated the Ghost Inscription.</p><p>While the three people, Mei Siren, Xiao Kongtong, and Ghost Granny, were feeling nervous and confused, they saw that the end of the long street was getting closer and closer. A picture scroll filled with a dilapidated aura was being constructed by spiritual strength.</p><p>Dried black blood splattered all over the streets, setting the tone of the gray.</p><p>As the scroll was pushed forward, half of a giant’s head suddenly appeared on the long street. In front of it was a broken sword, which was also extremely tall.</p><p>As they advanced further, they saw all kinds of broken limbs and the organs of giants. They were either displayed on the long street or hung on the broken soldiers on the ancient city’s building walls. It was terrifying and horrifying.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
