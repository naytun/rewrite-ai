(Part 3)</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clutched his head and grinned ear to ear, but his words were full of innocence and submission.</p><p>Master Siren was on the verge of exploding. He had to run a little longer now, or Master Siren would not be able to calm down. Xu Xiaoshou was dying of laughter. He held his belly while running.</p><p>“You know very well what kind of mentality you have! I was kind enough to teach you the Heart Sword Technique, and now you’re making fun of me?” As Mei Siren chased after him, he could not bear it anymore. He directly pulled out the sword image from behind.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A heaven-defying pressure descended.</p><p>“D*mn, you’re cheating!” Xu Xiaoshou was pressed to the ground on the spot. He was so scared that he immediately covered his head with his hands and didn’t dare to shout anymore. He could only admit his mistake.</p><p>“I’m wrong, Master Siren, I’m wrong. All of this is my fault. Please kill me to vent your anger.”</p><p>Did he dare to retreat in order to advance?</p><p>Mei Siren was so angry that he laughed. How could he not see what Xu Xiaoshou was up to? He immediately sneered and raised his stone sword. In a flash, he appeared in front of the little toad that was lying on the ground.</p><p>“I won’t kill you.</p><p>“Today, I’ll teach you another lesson. That’s why I sent you flying with a single strike!”</p><p>Looking at Xu Xiaoshou holding his head and crouching up timidly before carefully peeking out his eyes, Mei Siren blew out a breath from his nose and the stone sword in his hand slashed down fiercely.</p><p>“With a high-frequency vibration attack and dark power, even if you have a strange sword body, I can still use the force to hit you!” As soon as he stopped talking, Mei Siren’s eyes turned fierce and he shouted angrily, “Shock Path!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even have time to flash. He felt a terrible force fall on his head, and he couldn’t even maintain his toughness anymore. He was blown back to his old home deep underground like a sweet potato.</p><p>“Phew…”</p><p>On the cracked stone slab, Mei Siren looked at the bottomless pit in front of him and finally let out a long sigh of relief, feeling that he had regained some of his dignity.</p><p>The audacity!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was too bold!</p><p>For many years, after becoming the Seven Sword Deity, he had taught countless students, but Mei Siren had never been so angry that he lost his self-control. He couldn’t even remember how long it had been since he had been angry!</p><p>He had never thought that he would fall for Xu Xiaoshou’s underhanded trick today and get a handle on him.</p><p>Yet, this brat still dared to put on a show!</p><p>Mei Siren was furious. As he thought about it, he felt a different kind of emotion for no reason.</p><p>He hadn’t experienced this feeling for a long time.</p><p>Perhaps, this was a game that would exist between a normal teacher and a student.</p><p>No, no, no!</p><p>This was definitely not normal. Xu Xiaoshou was a mutant!</p><p>“Master Siren, are you not angry?” From the hole in front of him, a timid head suddenly crawled out and asked carefully.</p><p>Mei Siren snorted coldly and did not reply. He only stared at the little thing angrily.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou scratched his head timidly, but he didn’t look down and met Mei Siren’s eyes.</p><p>Not long after, the two of them were obviously connected to the same channel, and they flashed back to the rare embarrassment that only belonged to the old Sword Deity.</p><p>The old man and the young man couldn’t hold it in any longer. They looked at each other in the ruins and burst into laughter.</p><p>“Hahahaha!”</p><p>“Hehehehe!”</p><p>As they laughed, images flickered in Xu Xiaoshou’s mind, and he suddenly recalled the happy times he had in the Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>That was the first time he tried to practice the Seeds on All Five Fingers. However, he accidentally shot the Fire Seed into Elder Sang’s nose.</p><p>That was the first time he had tried the condensing method of infernal heavens. However, he had accidentally blown up the entire third floor of the Spiritual Library Division, and even attracted the law enforcement team to come and take a look.</p><p>It was when he and his little junior sister were about to leave the Spirit Palace, that Elder Sang became talkative and nagged about a lot of messy things.</p><p>He didn’t understand it in the past.</p><p>Now that he thought back to the last time he saw Elder Sang in the Eighth Palace before he entered cultivation deviation, he finally realized that karma was actually predestined.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stopped laughing.</p><p>Mei Siren also stopped laughing. He closed his eyes and had already noticed the faint loneliness that suddenly appeared on Xu Xiaoshou’s face.</p><p>“Do you miss your Master?” The elderly Sword Deity’s lips curled up as he squatted down.</p><p>“A little…” Xu Xiaoshou, who was lying beside the deep pit with only his head above the ground, shrank down a little, not hiding his emotions.</p><p>The smile on Mei Siren’s face disappeared, and he let out a long sigh. He reached out and rubbed Xu Xiaoshou’s head. He rubbed it for a long time, carefully feeling the slight pain in his palm.</p><p>He stopped and looked up at the sky.</p><p>The sky on Abyss Island was always bright. There was no darkness here, but it didn’t mean that one could always be bright.</p><p>“Master Siren…” Xu Xiaoshou was still in a low mood, and he looked up at the sky with the old Sword Deity.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou.” Mei Siren retracted his hand and suddenly said, “Call me teacher.”</p><p>He looked over with a smile and looked at the young figure beside the deep pit. His voice was as warm as the light of the day on Abyss Island.</p><p>“The word ‘master’ has heavy connotations. A person can only have one Master in his life.”</p><p>“This old man thinks that we haven’t known each other for long and can only teach you about the Way of the Sword. I can be your ‘teacher’, but I can’t be your ‘master’.</p><p>“It’s because you’ve already grown up. We didn’t get to know each other because we were ignorant or met because we were insignificant. So, you can just call me ‘teacher’.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned when he heard this. His hands beside the deep pit suddenly became powerless. He felt a lump in his throat and an inexplicable emotion welled up in his heart.</p><p>“Teacher,” he called out in a low voice.</p><p>“You may rise.” Mei Siren smiled and reached out to the lonely little beast in the deep pit. He pulled it up and turned around to look forward.</p><p>“The road ahead is still long. I can accompany you for a while, but where you can go in the end will depend on you.”</p><p>“I understand.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou replied silently and looked forward.</p><p>From the thousand-mile-long path of sword energy created by Master Siren, what could not be seen was the end, and what could not be sensed was the distance.</p><p>“Then, it’s time to take the next step.”</p><p>Mei Siren only paused for a moment to confirm that Xu Xiaoshou had indeed walked out of his momentary sadness just now. He smiled and guided without leaving a trace.</p><p>“While you were cultivating the Heart Sword Technique, there were still people who carried your burden and moved forward in your place. They blocked the two higher void-level experts!”</p><p>With that, he stepped forward. His temperament was still warm, but deep in his eyes, which had his back to Xu Xiaoshou, there was a bit more murderous intent.</p><p>‘He had a big mouth indeed.’ Xu Xiaoshou thought as he laughed. Sure enough, this uncle was the one doing all the dirty work, it was really hard on him.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, have you mastered the Heart Sword Technique?” Mei Siren did not turn around and asked calmly. In fact, he already had an answer in his heart.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“You’ve also formed the Present Gods and Buddhas?” He made a final confirmation.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>You’re so fast, you’ve really broken the record for the fastest practitioner of the Heart Sword Technique in history.” Mei Siren sighed in his heart, but his expression soon returned to being solemn.</p><p>“That’s just right. He’s not done yet. A sharpened sword can only show its brilliance with blood.</p><p>“It’s time to test the sword!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
