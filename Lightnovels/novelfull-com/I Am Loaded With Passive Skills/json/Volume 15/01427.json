He had stones in his hand, but there were only ten stones, so he did not dare to throw them.</p><p>Members of the Five Extreme Physiques were all abnormal.</p><p>Both in their abilities and thoughts.</p><p>Their fate had destined that their path of growth would be met with disdain, and their abilities had determined that they would never be able to make any friends in their lives.</p><p>This kind of person would either die in the middle of cultivation or grow up to become a devil that wreaked havoc in an uncontrollable manner!</p><p>Jiang Buyi felt that his task was to try and calm down a furnace of Elixirs that was about to explode with words and it was obvious he was not skilled in conducting alchemy.</p><p>He didn’t think that his plan would succeed. He had already decided that if the situation on the other side was slightly off, he would flee even if it meant he wasted a chance to launch an attack.</p><p>Yes, he would flee!</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Buyi did not want to fight at all. He did not want to be used as an exchange.</p><p>Jiang Buyi could treat it as a joke when others said that they did not want to live.</p><p>However, when this Five Extreme Physiques said that he did not want to live, it meant he truly wanted to die.</p><p>How great of an honor would it be for Huang Quan to have a Demi-Saint accompany him in his death?</p><p>The scene was triggered at once.</p><p>At the critical moment, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man suddenly withdrew his Qi of Decay, straightened up, and even restrained the power of the Three Loathsome Eyes.</p><p>He chuckled and said,</p><p>“Why didn’t Demi-Saint Jiang tell me earlier? I had no malicious intention when I came here; I just wanted to give you a choice.”</p><p>His demeanor was so calm; it was as if everything that had happened before was all faked and that his ‘fight to the death’ attitude was just for show.</p><p>Jiang Buyi took a deep breath. “If you really meant what you said, then you should retract your ability.” He then glanced at himself.</p><p>If the other party did not restrain the ability of his Body of Decay, even if he merely wanted to chat, Jiang Buyi would not be able to withstand it and would have to make a move – not to kill, but to transcend the tribulation.</p><p>As soon as he said that, the scene suddenly became quiet.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man tilted his head slightly. His face was covered by the mask, so it was unclear what his expression was like, but it felt like he was in deep thought.</p><p>“We… have only met once?” he asked after a long time.</p><p>Jiang Buyi nodded silently. He could not figure out the intention behind this sudden question. However, if he did not include this time, he had only met this person once in the Deep Sea World.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man also nodded and the spiritual source in his body surged. Then, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s form on Jiang Buyi’s body disappeared bit by bit as he swallowed it back into his body.</p><p>In an instant, in Jiang Buyi’s eyes, the aura of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man became even more dispirited.</p><p>It didn’t seem like the other party had restrained his magical powers, but rather that he was the one who helped the Five Decays of Heaven and Man to bear his curse!</p><p>“I saved your life.” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man said calmly.</p><p>“…” Jiang Buyi was speechless for a moment, but he did not refute his claim.</p><p>Perhaps that was the case?</p><p>Curses and bad luck always accompanied the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and his surroundings. This was passive. He had no intention to hurt anyone, and he had no control over the switchover of these abilities.</p><p>However, what he did just now was to take the initiative to bear an additional part of the power of the curse…he gathered the surrounding curse power and bore it all by himself.</p><p>But…</p><p>Should I thank him?</p><p>Jiang Buyi was silent. He thought, “If you had not appeared, this mess would not have occurred. Why should I thank you?”</p><p>He was still immersed in the strange ability of the opposite party, and this was the first time he was so interested in someone, but he had no intention to try and win him over.</p><p>“Body of Decay…”</p><p>Based on his memory, even if it was a Body of Decay, it seemed that the person himself could not control the curse and misfortune that he inadvertently emitted.</p><p>However, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had an additional method to resolve the problem of the decayed energy that surrounded his whole being!</p><p>Did this mean that the development of his Body of Decay had already reached the final-stage realm?</p><p>If that was the case…?</p><p>Would such a person be willing to live under Huang Quan’s control?</p><p>Jiang Buyi did not ask. He only felt that his body had become ‘clean’ again. As he watched the Saint Calamity of the Nine Heavens disappear, he let out a sigh of relief and said, “At the First Hall of Sins? What did you want to say earlier?”</p><p>“I’ve already said that I’m here to give Demi-Saint Jiang a choice,” the Five Decays of Heaven and Man said.</p><p>“What choice?”</p><p>“The two paths are intertwined, and we can work together, or die.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s forehead twitched slightly. At one moment, he even felt that he had become Xu Xiaoshou in the Forest of Miracles while the other party was the Demi-Saint.</p><p>What sort of choice was this?</p><p>It was clear there was only one path!</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou fared better than him. At least he had something to rely on and could use external forces to break out of the predicament at that time.</p><p>Jiang Buyi did not have this choice. He was born to be someone that others could rely on. Now that he had fallen to this state, he found that he had completely lost the bargaining chip.</p><p>He had lost all his means and abilities!</p><p>At this moment, they couldn’t even break the stalemate!</p><p>“You were there too, in the Forest of Miracles.” Jian Buyi seemed to realize something.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man seemed to chuckle under his mask, and his tone seemed a little more pleasant. “When Demi-Saint Jiang was selected by others, you didn’t expect this day to come, did you?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi also laughed.</p><p>The so-called ‘Dragon swims in shallow water’ and ‘When the tiger leaves the hills, it would be bullied by dogs’ referred to his current situation, right?</p><p>He was not angry, because he had lost the right to be angry. “I’m very curious. How can you be so sure that I can’t kill you in seconds? To be honest, I can still do it.”</p><p>“But the price is very high, isn’t it?” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man asked a rhetorical question, and after a slight pause, he said:</p><p>“Demi-Saint Jiang, you may not know this, but our Lord Huang Quan is interested in ancient history, so his comprehension of the Abyss Island would not be any lesser than your Demi-Saint faction, and may even be better.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
