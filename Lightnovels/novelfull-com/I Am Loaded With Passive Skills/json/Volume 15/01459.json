(Part 2)</p><p>Who would have thought that he would be stunned by what he saw?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had disappeared!</p><p>In that position, there was only a huge silver moon hanging high in the sky!</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Mei Siren’s eyes widened as if he had realized something, and his spiritual sense swept behind him.</p><p>The sword image had disappeared!</p><p>This meant that he had entered Xu Xiaoshou’s spiritual world.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou was cultivating the Present Gods and Buddhas in front of him, right? The Present Gods and Buddhas in the eyes of normal people only released their inner selves and conjured a monster, right?</p><p>How could Xu Xiaoshou construct a world?</p><p>Was he crazy? How could a person’s limited energy be enough to support the construction of a complete world with the Heart Sword Technique? The illusionary sword technique was more like it. After all, illusionary things were all fake!</p><p>If he did this, he would break down his mind!</p><p>Just as these thoughts flashed through his mind, his spiritual senses could not scan his sword image, but it allowed Mei Siren to see this broken chaos world clearly.</p><p>Nine Heavens of lightning disasters, volcanic eruptions, mountain torrents, and tsunamis – this was the end of the spiritual world!</p><p>“As expected, Xu Xiaoshou played himself to death. I should have intervened earlier.” At this moment, Mei Siren was filled with regret.</p><p>However, before this emotion could spread, a melodious and fearless voice had already drifted into his ears.</p><p>“This building should only exist in the heavens…”</p><p>“And only I can handle it…”</p><p>What did that mean?</p><p>Before Mei Siren could react, he was stunned to see that in the dilapidated spiritual world, under the silver moon, there was a towering ancient building with 99 floors.</p><p>The familiar ancient tower, the First Pavilion in the Sky?</p><p>The imagery of Xu Xiaoshou? The Present Gods and Buddhas that he really wanted to condense? But why was it a building?</p><p>No!</p><p>It wasn’t just a building!</p><p>Mei Siren’s line of sight was fixed, and he seemed to see the blurry back of the tall building, which was full of cold pride and loneliness.</p><p>“This back…”</p><p>The moon, the building, the back.</p><p>With just these three images, as ancient swordsmen, how could Mei Siren not realize how treacherous the Present Gods and Buddhas that Xu Xiaoshou was really constructing were?</p><p>This was the imagery of ‘Sword God Gu Louying’!</p><p>“I’m asking you to surpass me and to know the unknown, but I didn’t ask you to mess around like this!” Mei Siren was already filled with bitterness.</p><p>He could almost imagine how much mental damage Xu Xiaoshou would cause to himself by constructing this imagery.</p><p>This was an injury that could not be healed!</p><p>Now that he thought back to that rebellious declaration just now, he said that this building should only exist in the heavens and that only he could handle it.</p><p>Mei Siren knew that Xu Xiaoshou was about to fail.</p><p>No one had ever been able to surpass the Sword God Gu Louying’s imagery, even though this was the eternal dream of ancient swordsmen.</p><p>But one had to act within one’s means!</p><p>However, before they could stop him or make a sound, Mei Siren realized that the figure on the building had turned from blurry to real!</p><p>“How is that possible?!”</p><p>At this moment, the thoughts in the mind of Mei Siren were instantly crushed by endless doubts.</p><p>In the chaotic scene full of doomsday disasters, the figure in front of the silver moon on the ancient building in the distance conjured a black robe, black hair, and a black sword.</p><p>It was too specific!</p><p>Even without turning around, Mei Siren knew that it was Xu Xiaoshou who had replaced the figure.</p><p>“This is impossible!”</p><p>Mei Siren didn’t believe that he would succeed.</p><p>For someone who had not mastered the Nine Major Sword Techniques, what mental state could he use to replace the imagery of the Sword God Gu Louying?</p><p>How many elixirs to heal mental trauma did he have to take to recover from the damage caused by the construction of this layer of imagery?</p><p>In fact, he couldn’t even mention success, because no matter how many pills he took, it wouldn’t work, not to mention that Xu Xiaoshou had never taken any pills while he was cultivating the Heart Sword Technique!</p><p>However, in the next second, reality hit Mei Siren hard.</p><p>He only saw the black back on the building seemingly injected with a soul. It moved slightly, only turning its head slightly, only slightly raising its eyes in disdain.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The moment their eyes met, Mei Siren felt the faith in his body collapse, and all the thoughts in his mind exploded. His spiritual body fell from the Nine Heavens, falling into the chaos world that was full of disasters.</p><p>“It’s impossible to succeed…”</p><p>As ancient swordsmen, Mei Siren naturally knew what the greatest “God” in the world was for ancient swordsmen.</p><p>It could be said that the Sword God Gu Louying was the ancient swordsmen’s greatest inner demon, and no one had been able to surpass him.</p><p>But this was an inner demon that he didn’t have to care about, because how many generations ago did it belong to?</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou’s Heart Sword Technique resurrected the image of Sword God Gu Louying in the most powerful way and moved it into his spiritual world.</p><p>And his Heart Sword Technique was to lure people into his spiritual world. This world, which appeared with the aura of Sword God Gu Louying, was full of disasters, which could cause damage to people’s spiritual bodies.</p><p>Not only that, but Xu Xiaoshou also used his authority as the master of the world to restore the aura of the Sword God Gu Louying, dealing the most substantial mental blow to the uninvited guests who entered his spiritual world.</p><p>“A crazy idea, an unpredictable success.”</p><p>Mei Siren was in a dilemma, but he only wanted to slap the table and praise Xu Xiaoshou’s actions.</p><p>But the next second, he suddenly realized that something was wrong.</p><p>After making eye contact with the back of the figure on the building, his spiritual body seemed to have been contaminated, and some unclean things came out!</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>He suddenly covered his head and stared in disbelief at the faint devilish energy that his spiritual body had started to emit.</p><p>Only then did he realize that the loud explosion in his mind just now was not only because of Xu Xiaoshou’s success but also because of the opponent’s absolute mental attack!</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>Pain, madness, chaos, and other emotions in the dark chaos world suddenly invaded the spiritual body of Mei Siren, and they screamed immediately.</p><p>Mei Siren finally realized how terrifying Xu Xiaoshou’s “sword” was!</p><p>He had really perfectly controlled the power of cultivation deviation and brought it to his Present Gods and Buddhas. He could also use it to give the most ruthless blow to the victim.</p><p>“No, I’m not in a good state right now. Something’s going to happen…”</p><p>Mei Siren, who had also cultivated the Heart Sword Technique, felt that something was wrong.</p><p>Cultivation deviation was not a small matter. Even a demi-saint could die if he was not careful!</p><p>This no longer had anything to do with the sword user’s cultivation realm.</p><p>No matter what kind of simple, comical, and weak attack he encountered, as long as he was hit and entered a state of cultivation deviation, he would no longer be facing the swordsman, but himself, and the inner demon!</p><p>In the current situation, Mei Siren could no longer care about Xu Xiaoshou’s cultivation of the Heart Sword Technique.</p><p>If anything went wrong, he would have killed Xu Xiaoshou in his spiritual world. The real murderer was not an enemy, but the inner demon!</p><p>“Wait, I can’t think about this…”</p><p>When his thoughts reached this point, Mei Siren already regretted it.</p><p>However, there was no medicine for regret in this world. In just a moment, the emotion called fear was directly affected by the devilish energy around him and was magnified in the mind of Mei Siren.</p><p>Mei Siren’s pupils contracted, and he wanted to resist.</p><p>The next second, he covered his head with both hands and let out a painful cry.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>In the black chaotic world that was filled with devilish energy, a “sword image” monster stood up while stepping on the Yama. This time, the eyes of the sword image were scarlet, and it was clearly in a state of cultivation deviation!</p><p>It raised its eyes and looked up.</p><p>Under the hazy blood light, the tall figure under the silver moon had completely turned around.</p><p>However, this time, he was no longer Xu Xiaoshou, but the enemy of Mei Siren!</p><p>With his hands behind his back, he allowed the storm of disaster to lift his clothes. There was no sword in his hand, but he was calm and relaxed. He laughed loudly in this doomsday scene.</p><p>“I didn’t expect that after not seeing you for so many years, you can also cultivate such a sword image. It’s quite powerful, hehe.”</p><p>“Then, come, fight me.”</p><p>He couldn’t go up. This was all fake. The Devil’s Will wanted to stop him with the last bit of clarity left in its spiritual altar, but the sword image had already pounced away with a howl.</p><p>At the same time, Mei Siren felt that it was extremely absurd. His consciousness also roared in an indescribable voice.</p><p>“You Tu, endure my sword!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
