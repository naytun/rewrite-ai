Devil Sword Technique! (Part 3)</p><p>“Then I’ll go down and try,” Xu Xiaoshou said.</p><p>“Be careful of that ‘Cursed Yin Eye’,” Xiao Kongtong stared at the black-purple sea, floating up and down, and the eyeball that was emitting an evil power, and reminded him.</p><p>This was a power that even he felt his heart palpitate, but with Master Siren around, there shouldn’t be any problem.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded and looked at Master Siren again, wanting to see what good suggestions or opinions this teacher would give.</p><p>Mei Siren tapped his palm with his paper fan, but he didn’t say anything about the battle. He just smiled and said, “Fantasy Sword Technique is the main sword technique of the You Tu lineage. This time, I’ll take the opportunity to comprehend the fantasy realm here.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyebrows twitched.</p><p>Fantasy Sword Technique…</p><p>Master Siren was totally at ease with him. Doesn’t he feel that the following battle would be dangerous? What made him think that he had the ability to fight against the higher void level who had mastered the power of the ancestral source?</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s expression turned strange, and he cast a glance at Master Siren without leaving a trace.</p><p>From what he said, Master Siren was planning to draw a clear line between Xu Xiaoshou and his family.</p><p>This won’t do!</p><p>His junior brother had to learn Fantasy Sword Technique, but his teacher did not have time, and Master Siren was not good at this. However, he was available.</p><p>As long as he asked, he could show him the true meaning of creating a virtual world with the Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>This was much better than other ancient swordsmen who only studied the surface, learned the Space-Time Transition, and only wanted to polish and perfect their own Way of the Sword.</p><p>After all, this technique was the only way to reach the second realm of the Fantasy Sword Technique – the Second World.</p><p>As his thoughts ran wild, Xu Xiaoshou, who had received his teacher’s approval, already had an idea.</p><p>“Then I’ll go down.”</p><p>“Remember to look at me. I’m afraid…” Before waiting for a response, Xu Xiaoshou jumped into the long street of this fantasy realm.</p><p>His target was not the old woman who was still sprinting back and forth, but the strange-looking black-purple sea that was filled with a terrifying aura.</p><p>Obviously, this was challenging and also the second goal that Master Siren had asked him to study!</p><p>…</p><p>“Fantasy Sword Technique!”</p><p>He muttered these three words in his heart as he descended from the night sky onto the long street. However, Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to spare any extra attention to comprehend the so-called main cultivation path of the You Tu lineage that Master Siren had mentioned.</p><p>Accompanied by Master Siren and Xiao Kongtong in the air, he felt strange when he looked down at the black-purple sea from a bird’s eye view, but he was not afraid.</p><p>At this moment, a man landed on the evil ocean. Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he had turned into a lone boat in the center of the stormy ocean. Even his mind was affected by the evil thoughts and was about to sink.</p><p>Hallucinating, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Demonized, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>Demonized? This seemed to be the first time a word had appeared in the Information Bar. Was it a word related to mental corruption? Xu Xiaoshou pondered.</p><p>The hallucination was the effect of Xiao Kongtong’s Fantasy Sword Technique, so it was not a big deal. Xu Xiaoshou was mainly worried about whether this ocean would cause serious harm to him.</p><p>With this thought in mind, he glanced at the two people in the night sky again. He gritted his teeth and sank his body that was floating on the black-purple sea, letting his ankle sink slightly into the strange fluid condensed by evil thoughts.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>In just an instant, Xu Xiaoshou, who had made physical contact with the black-purple sea, felt his spiritual world being bombarded by lightning and strangely invaded. His thoughts suddenly became chaotic, and his primitive desires burst out, rampaging like a beast.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>He let out a violent roar, and his eyes instantly turned red. Black and purple evil energy gushed out from his body as if he was about to be assimilated by the black-purple sea.</p><p>The color was black, and it was obvious that Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t withstand the impact of the power of the evil god’s aura and had entered a cultivation deviation state.</p><p>“This!” In the night sky, Xiao Kongtong was shocked and turned around to look at Master Siren.</p><p>“Are you really alright? I don’t think I can handle a spiritual attack of this level. Xu Xiaoshou has just learned the Heart Sword Technique!” Xiao Kongtong’s eyes were filled with worry.</p><p>“Fret not.” Mei Siren smiled, and his entire body exuded the dignified and steady temperament of an old senior who had seen great storms and waves. He was not moved by Xu Xiaoshou’s change at all.</p><p>Fret not?</p><p>This was still safe?</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was stunned. He thought, “Master Siren, you really aren’t possessed, are you? You actually want to murder Xu Xiaoshou, right?”</p><p>Turning his head, Mei Siren accidentally caught a glimpse of the silver moon constructed by the Fantasy Sword Technique behind Xiao Kongtong. The corner of his lips twitched, and he quickly shifted his gaze away. He said earnestly.</p><p>“It’s just a mere cultivation deviation, let’s not talk about it.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou cultivates the Heart Sword Technique, but perhaps it would be more appropriate to call it the Devil Sword Technique.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
