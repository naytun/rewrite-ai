(Part 2)</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>An explosive roar came from his mouth.</p><p>With this shout, the air in front of her surged and the sudden anger turned into a substance, sweeping and distorting the space in Xiao Kongtong’s fantasy realm.</p><p>Aura!</p><p>What Xu Xiaoshou relied on was the latest usage of the Swallow the Mountains and Rivers technique he had learned while practicing the Heart Sword Technique. It allowed him to instantly climb to the peak of his aura and change the heart of his enemy.</p><p>At this moment, in the eyes of Ghost Granny, the puny Master Stage Xu Xiaoshou was like a sleeping dragon that suddenly woke up!</p><p>No!</p><p>Not only that!</p><p>There was a giant riding on the Dragon!</p><p>The terrifying aura came along with the sound waves. The shock it brought to her heart was no less than the shock when she first saw the sword image of the Seven Sword Deity, Mei Siren.</p><p>“Little thief!” Ghost Granny’s mind was affected before she could even complete her thoughts. Her mind went blank and her movements were also frozen for a moment.</p><p>…</p><p>“This aura!”</p><p>Under the silver moon, Xiao Kongtong raised his eyebrows and turned to look at Master Siren.</p><p>Was that a foul?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have used something that didn’t belong to the Phantom Swords Technique.</p><p>“It’s a foul, but momentum is something that can’t be controlled by people.” Mei Siren didn’t care much and started to fan himself.</p><p>If his own disciple broke the rules, what kind of rules would that be?</p><p>The rules were made for others to hear, so just listen and don’t take it seriously.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong chuckled and changed his mind, “Master Siren, are you really going to let her go? If Xu Xiaoshou loses…”</p><p>“What do you think?” Mei Siren asked.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong choked, his expression turning odd. “I originally thought that you would be the kind of person who would… Hmm… How should I put it?”</p><p>“A pedantic person?” The corners of Mei Siren’s lips lifted.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s face stiffened, “I don’t dare to.”</p><p>He paused for a moment before he said in relief, “In any case, I don’t think so anymore.”</p><p>Returning to the battlefield, this Eldest Senior Brother of the Fringe Moon Immortal City, who had fought in the Holy Sword Land of the Eastern Region, finally let go of the grudge in his heart.</p><p>He had never intended to let Ghost Granny leave!</p><p>He had learned the principle of cutting grass without removing the roots when he was young.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong had thought that Master Siren would not agree. After all, the old senior was a man of his word, so he had to act on his behalf. However, now he heard Master Siren talking…</p><p>Oh!</p><p>It turned out that everyone had the same wavelength!</p><p>“Aura.”</p><p>Murmuring, he felt the sudden rise of Xu Xiaoshou’s body and the magnificent momentum that was enough to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with him in an instant. He couldn’t help but sigh again.</p><p>It could be said that he was the one who had truly witnessed Xu Xiaoshou’s growth.</p><p>Back in Tiansang City, a mere assassin of the Three Incenses, Red Dog, almost took Xu Xiaoshou’s life.</p><p>He didn’t think that the situation would change so quickly. Not long after, Xu Xiaoshou’s aura alone could probably suppress the Red Dog that wanted to kill him that day!</p><p>“It’s here!”</p><p>Before they could think too much, Master Siren’s serious voice came from beside them. It was obvious that the main point they both wanted to see had come.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s eyes became focused as he looked at the battle.</p><p>…</p><p>On the long street.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was able to control Ghost Granny’s soul body with his aura alone, could be said to have many ways to kill someone.</p><p>With his previous comprehension of the Swallow the Mountains and Rivers, its power could be said to have increased by more than several times.</p><p>He could have used the Disillusionment Finger to break Ghost Granny’s soul and tell Master Siren that he had broken the rules this time, but it would definitely not happen again.</p><p>However, Ghost Granny was not worth wasting nearly 50% of the charge points of his Disillusionment Finger.</p><p>He still had a few soul weapons that he had plundered from his enemies. If he took one out, he believed that he would be able to cut off a few pieces of flesh from Ghost Granny and peel off a few layers of soul energy.</p><p>But at the end of the day, Xu Xiaoshou also wanted to test out his newly acquired ability.</p><p>“Hong, it’s your turn to go to the arena!”</p><p>Taking advantage of Ghost Granny’s momentary dizziness, the Ghost Inscription in Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils disappeared, and the Red Ghost Inscription in between his eyebrows glowed.</p><p>In the next second, the air on the long street suddenly turned cold, so cold that it was creepy.</p><p>It was as if the Nine Sereneties’ gate of hell had opened in the mortal world. Under everyone’s tense gaze, a glimmer of light fell under the silver moon.</p><p>In the dim light, the tiny stars gradually enlarged, and finally, void general Hong’s half-knelt figure which was more than ten feet tall suddenly descended on the ground.</p><p>It was in blood-red armor, and a giant heavy sword that could only be held with two hands had pierced through its chest. Its head was held high, looking at the sky, and the will-o-wisp in its eyes was dark and gloomy. It died with its eyes open!</p><p>Hong, who looked like the Lord of Spirit Souls, took everyone’s attention as soon as it appeared. Even Ghost Granny, who had just recovered from her shock, was focused on it.</p><p>Then, between Ghost Granny and Xu Xiaoshou, who was retreating, he pointed at void general Hong’s head in the air. The will-o-wisp in its eyes condensed on the giant monster in front of him that was Ghost Granny!</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his fist from behind.</p><p>Black lines immediately appeared on the faces of Mei Siren and Xiao Kongtong as they watched this scene. They always felt that Xu Xiaoshou’s battle was child’s play, and it was too easy for him to get into character.</p><p>However, they immediately saw void general Hong in the air suddenly standing up straight. They were able to see its true form under the power of the Red Ghost Inscription. Its entire body was filled with fighting spirit as he roared angrily,</p><p>“Fight!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
