Devil Sword Technique! (Part 1)</p><p>“Eldest Senior Brother…”</p><p>In the night sky, an old and young figure stepped over. Xu Xiaoshou was the first to speak.</p><p>He originally wanted to address him as uncle, but after some thought, he realized that the identity of this Fringe Moon Immortal City’s Eldest Senior Brother had been exposed. He was the only disciple of Bazhun’an.</p><p>Moreover, he had also learned the 10 Sections of the Finger Sword from Bazhun’an, so he was considered half his disciple.</p><p>Regardless of whether he addressed Xiao Kongtong as Eldest Senior Brother as he did in the Fringe Moon Immortal City or as Eldest Senior Brother in the direct sense, this was more appropriate than calling him uncle.</p><p>Of course, this also revealed the close relationship between the two, which was beneficial in maintaining the relationship with such a big bodyguard.</p><p>“You guys are here…”</p><p>“Greetings, Master Siren.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong withdrew his gaze from the two figures scattered on the moonlit street and looked at Xu Xiaoshou and Mei Siren. He first nodded to Mei Siren to greet him, then looked at Xu Xiaoshou with a smile in his eyes.</p><p>“Is it because of Fringe Moon Immortal City or Teacher that you call me Eldest Senior Brother?”</p><p>“Both, but most of it is because of you, Eldest Senior Brother. Of course, without these, it’s better than ‘strange uncle’, right?” Xu Xiaoshou’s lips curled up. His thoughts were actually more inclined to the latter, but hazy beauty was definitely better than real beauty. Some things were better for everyone if they were not exposed.</p><p>The smiling man looked at Xu Xiaoshou deeply, with a few more complicated emotions in the depths of his eyes.</p><p>He felt regretful that he had lost his identity as the only disciple acknowledged by his teacher, but he also felt happy that he had found his long-lost younger brother after a long time.</p><p>However, there was no doubt that he enjoyed being called Eldest Senior Brother by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“At least you still have a conscience. I didn’t help you so many times in vain…”</p><p>After a “tsk” sound, Xiao Kongtong took a side glance at Master Siren and frowned, “He failed to cultivate the Heart Sword Technique?”</p><p>It had been less than an hour since Xu Xiaoshou entered a meditative state and he stalled the two higher void-level experts.</p><p>Strictly speaking, it was 45 minutes!</p><p>Xiao Kongtong calculated carefully. Even when he was taking action, he was always keeping track of time.</p><p>And in this short 45 minutes, Xu Xiaoshou had even entered cultivation deviation once.</p><p>It was not because of Master Siren’s intervention that he had regained his consciousness, but because he had relied on himself. He had even cultivated the Heart Sword Technique. Xiao Kongtong was filled with disbelief.</p><p>There was no one with such talent in the five regions!</p><p>45 minutes, this was even more ridiculous than Teacher’s record of an hour!</p><p>Not to mention that Xu Xiaoshou was a disciple of Master Siren’s sect, and the difficulty of cultivating the Heart Sword Technique had skyrocketed.</p><p>“I’ve succeeded.” Xu Xiaoshou smiled.</p><p>“If you succeed, don’t be discouraged. After all, it’s your first time. You should refer to Master Siren, not me and Teacher. After all, we have different sects. Master Siren’s record is seven days, and I think you may have the qualification to break it…” Xiao Kongtong tried to comfort him without thinking, but he suddenly stopped halfway.</p><p>“What did you say? You succeeded?” He widened his eyes in disbelief. He even turned around to look at Master Siren, only to find that the corners of Master Siren’s mouth could no longer be kept tight, and had started to curl up slightly.</p><p>“Yes.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded expressionlessly.</p><p>“Congratulations, congratulations!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong unconsciously gave a few words of praise before he came back to her senses. He asked in disbelief, “You’ve mastered the Heart Sword Technique? This speed is very fast, a little too fast… Moreover, you walked out from the state of cultivation deviation, so you should really be congratulated!”</p><p>After repeating “congratulations” twice, he remembered that he was already the Eldest Senior Brother and had to show some “elder brother is father” dignity in front of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s face stiffened, and he retracted all of his praise. He then used a lecturing tone that only someone who had experienced it would have and admonished,</p><p>“But it’s too early to be happy. You know, Master Siren not only mastered the Heart Sword Technique in seven days but also created the chaos form of Present Gods and Buddhas.</p><p>“It’s true that you’ve comprehended the Heart Sword Technique art in less than an hour, but you might not be able to find your Present Gods and Buddhas in your chaos form in another two or three weeks.”</p><p>As he smiled, he nodded heavily, as if trying to make up for the blow to his heart.</p><p>“I’ve found it,” Xu Xiaoshou said again.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter if you find it, just take your time to find it… Eh? Hmm? Ah?” Xiao Kongtong once again consoled him subconsciously, but he was stunned the next second.</p><p>He turned to look at Master Siren again and found that the old man was already waving his paper fan with a smile. On the surface of the fan, there were a few big words that were dazzling under the moonlight:</p><p>Are you stupid?</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s face turned green and white. He finally realized that something terrifying had happened to Xu Xiaoshou. It happened under Master Siren’s gaze, and in the short time he had left!</p><p>“You’ve cultivated the Present Gods and Buddhas in the chaos form?” He swallowed his saliva and stared at Xu Xiaoshou. His voice was a little heavier. “In 45 minutes?!”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded again. This time, he didn’t suppress his emotions and smiled. “I don’t know if that counts as chaos form. Perhaps I’ll have to ask Teacher.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
