It was as if he did not care about the battle that was interrupted by the summoning power of the void gate that day under the deep sea. He was also not afraid of the person in the distance.</p><p>What was there to fear about for a demi-saint?</p><p>“Then I shall not be polite.”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man raised his foot and stepped into the bounded domain. After a few steps, he arrived in front of Jiang Buyi.</p><p>“I really didn’t expect that you would dare to approach me alone without the restriction of the Spell Forbidden Barrier.” Jiang Buyi looked at the person in front of him with a faint smile. However, he was always on guard for any suspicious movement from the other party.</p><p>“I’m afraid. Of course, I’m afraid.” The voice of Five Decays of Heaven and Man was emotionless, but it hit the nail on the head. “However, Demi-saint Jiang doesn’t dare to attack me now, right?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi lifted the corner of his lips and his heart was beating as fast as before. He laughed and asked, “Why would I?”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man raised his dark eyes and silently looked at the demi-saint in front of him. Finally, he sighed, “What a strong determination.”</p><p>“But I don’t even feel the pressure of meeting a demi-saint. Why is that?” He paused and continued.</p><p>Finally, Jiang Buyi could not hold it in any longer. His expression changed as he realized that he had restrained the aura and pressure of a demi-saint too much because of the two messages in his mind.</p><p>He could not help but relax his energy reserve.</p><p>In the next second, a monstrous pressure suppressed Five Decays of Heaven and Man like a tsunami, till he trembled and his knees went soft.</p><p>“Because I’m curious. I’m curious why you dare to come in front of me and what are you up to?” Jiang Buyi said unhurriedly. Then, he quickly recalled the information in his mind.</p><p>Countdown of ten days!</p><p>There was no reduction!</p><p>This meant that the “you can’t make a move” mentioned by the spirit of Abyss Island was not absolute. As long as he didn’t touch the order of Abyss Island or fully exerted the power of a demi-saint, he would be fine using simple aura power and pressure.</p><p>With that, Jiang Buyi was completely at ease.</p><p>With his aura alone, more than 90% of the higher void could not fight him. It was not a problem for him to dominate Abyss Island.</p><p>“Demi-saint Jiang…” Five Decays of Heaven and Man struggled to resist the demi-saint’s pressure. His body trembled violently, but he gritted his teeth and laughed. “Is this all you can do?”.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s expression did not change, but his voice sank, “You really want to die?”.</p><p>“No, I just want to see whether you want to live or die, demi-saint Jiang!” Five Decays of Heaven and Man suddenly looked up. The light and shadow in his right eye changed, and three gray flowers swirled. A strange power came out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Jiang Buyi reacted quickly. He kicked the person in front of him a hundred miles away. At the same time, he quickly retreated. He subconsciously wanted to use his energy reserve to protect himself, but he resisted the urge.</p><p>He shouldn’t attack, he shouldn’t make a move!</p><p>He kept admonishing himself not to act rashly, but his thoughts suddenly stopped, as if he had understood something.</p><p>No!</p><p>He could only make a move!</p><p>This guy obviously knew something. The best solution now was to waste a chance to attack and kill him.</p><p>Otherwise, if this kid was to spread the news everywhere, everyone would know that he was unable to kill anyone in his current state. Wouldn’t he lose his reputation as a demi-saint?</p><p>In just a moment, Jiang Buyi had finished weighing the pros and cons and the Holy Power in his energy reserve was about to be drawn out.</p><p>“Demi-saint Jiang!”</p><p>A shrill roar came from the distance.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man rubbed his chest a hundred miles away, feeling the previous kick, which had no Holy Power fluctuations and was purely physical strength. He thought to himself, “Sure enough,” and then laughed loudly.</p><p>“If you want to kill me, you can. However, whether you can kill me in a second like when you’re at your peak, is another matter…”</p><p>“In your current state, you can only use your physical strength. It’s impossible for you to do what you want!”</p><p>“Do you believe what I said?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi stopped.</p><p>However, it was not because of the words of Five Decays of Heaven and Man, but because he suddenly smelled a foul smell around him.</p><p>No, it wasn’t the surroundings. The stench was actually coming from his own body?</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s pupils trembled as he swept the area with his holy will. He could clearly see that his physical state had completely changed.</p><p>His clothes were dirty, his hair had withered, his armpits were sweating, and his body was smelly.</p><p>Even his emotions were inexplicably filled with irritation, violence, bloodthirstiness, and other gray tones that would not appear normally when he was calm… He was only one step away from being an unpleasant person.</p><p>“Five Decays of Heaven and Man!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi realized something. He had thought that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was just the code name of the member of Yama. He did not expect that it was also an ability that he had mastered.</p><p>He raised his head.</p><p>As expected, the Nine Heavens was covered in dark clouds.</p><p>The cloud-type power that should have belonged to him was full of rejection at this moment. The lightning in it surged, almost condensing into a saint calamity and striking down on his head.</p><p>Jiang Buyi felt numb.</p><p>The saint calamity was a hurdle that must be passed to become a demi-saint, and it was a test for the higher voids.</p><p>However, he had already passed his saint calamity. What was going on now? Did he have to go through it again?</p><p>Not to mention the fact that he didn’t have all sorts of favorable conditions this time, even the treasures he had to defend against the saint calamity had almost been exhausted in the last tribulation.</p><p>Moreover, in his current state when he could only make a move ten times…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
