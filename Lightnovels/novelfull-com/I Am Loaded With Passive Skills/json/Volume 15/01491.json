The cuts were unusually smooth.</p><p>After that, under the shocked gazes of Xiao Kongtong and Ghost Granny…</p><p>With another soft slashing sound, the incomparably huge ancient city’s city towers, disappeared one by one without a trace!</p><p>There was no explosion, no shattering, and it didn’t turn into powder before disappearing.</p><p>Their existence was erased just like that. It was as if they did not exist in this world.</p><p>Even the memories were hazy.</p><p>The memories of the buildings in the ancient city in the minds of Xiao Kongtong and Ghost Granny also began to fade away.</p><p>Their expressions changed from shock to normal.</p><p>It was as if the ancient city towers, long streets, and the Kingdom of Giants should have been like this since ancient times, a platform with an unusually smooth surface.</p><p>Behind Mei Siren, the sword image of the Azure Mo Swords turned into an illusory and transparent heavy sword when he put his palms together. It was so tall that it pierced the clouds and then cut down from the sky.</p><p>Mei Siren stood still and unmoved with the stone sword in his hand. Without any emotion, he read out the name of the second realm of the Heart Sword Technique, ”</p><p>“Wisdom…”</p><p>“Teacher, please wait!”</p><p>At this critical moment, Xu Xiaoshou finally recovered from the impact of the world of obsession.</p><p>As soon as he opened his eyes, he saw Master Siren’s angry sword that was going to wipe out the world because he was injured.</p><p>The second thing he saw was that void general Hong, who was half-kneeling with his head held high, was completely unmoved by the world-destroying sword!</p><p>It completely ignored Master Siren’s world-destroying sword and stared at Xu Xiaoshou with its eyes that were surrounded by dark will-o-wisps. It seemed that other than the obsession of fighting to the death, there was also a little curiosity.</p><p>It was curious about this human who could see it intrude into its spiritual obsessiveness for no reason. He could also withstand the power of the Demon God and the power of the Giant Clan, two void generals, and not die.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>Suddenly, it roared angrily, as if it was venting the unwillingness and anger in its heart.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. He thought it had sensed Master Siren’s sword and was about to fight back.</p><p>However, he soon realized that he had thought too much. Void general Hong’s shout was not aimed at Master Siren, and it was not aimed at him. It was just passing through endless time and space, roaring at the enemy at that time. It was also a manifestation of its obsession.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou used Perception to scan the area and noticed that apart from himself, Xiao Kongtong, Ghost Granny, and even Master Siren did not seem to have heard the voice, just like how they could not see void general Hong.</p><p>He stretched out his hand and stopped Master Siren from slashing down. He said softly, “It has no ill intentions.”</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>The transparent heavy sword formed by the sword image of the Azure Mo Swords changed from a vertical slash to a horizontal slash.</p><p>Wisdom nothingness had cut off the trace of Mei Siren’s sword, and also eliminated the backlash that would come if the sword was forcefully retracted.</p><p>“No ill intentions?”</p><p>Mei Siren stopped after the first strike and looked at Xu Xiaoshou coldly. He was surprised that Xu Xiaoshou’s seriously injured body had recovered so quickly, but he was more critical of Xu Xiaoshou’s previous injuries.</p><p>How was this not malicious?</p><p>He was almost killed!</p><p>“It didn’t attack me. It just pulled me into its world of obsession and let me experience some of the fragments of its life on its behalf, “Xu Xiaoshou scratched his head, a little embarrassed. “I’m too weak, I can’t even handle these.”</p><p>Mei Siren was speechless.</p><p>“What are you going to do?” He asked.</p><p>“Let me handle this!” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t explain. He went to the half-kneeling void general Hong.</p><p>He finally realized that the powerful spirit soul before him truly did not care about what was happening in the current era.</p><p>The light of hatred in its eyes was still given to the enemy of its era, the terrifying existence surrounded by devilish energy. Even if Master Siren wanted to kill it, it would not move.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly shouted loudly, which startled Mei Siren, Xiao Kongtong, and Ghost Granny.</p><p>Condemned, Passive Points +3.</p><p>Glared At, Passive Points, +3.</p><p>After he finished shouting, void general Hong’s eyes, which were burning with dark will-o-wisps, focused on Xu Xiaoshou again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s Ghost Inscription turned into a Red Ghost Inscription between his eyebrows. He raised his fist and waved it in front of him.</p><p>“Fight! Until the end!”</p><p>“Blood! To the last drop!”</p><p>He was speaking in the language of the Giant Clan.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the void general Hong’s eyes burst with a fierce fighting spirit. It was still kneeling, but its aura began to rise, as high as the sky.</p><p>“Fight! Until the end!”</p><p>“Blood! To the last drop!”</p><p>It responded with a heavy voice in the language of the Giant Clan that Mei Siren, Xiao Kongtong, and Ghost Granny couldn’t hear or understand.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou recalled the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale and found that the Dragon Scale’s heartbeat had calmed down.</p><p>“Are there any problems with the contract? Are there any problems with the contract? Is it risky? Is it risky?”</p><p>“Thump!”</p><p>The Holy Emperor Dragon Scale seemed to have been woken up from its slumber. It stretched lazily and rolled its eyes.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was relieved.</p><p>It turned out that the so-called danger was only the experience in void general Red’s world of obsession. As expected, the risk was not high. Water Ghost’s stuff was indeed useful!</p><p>“Fight! Until the end!”</p><p>“Blood! To the last drop!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou roared again, and then gently pulled out the Red Ghost Inscription, slowly approaching the void general Red’s forehead.</p><p>It did not react strongly…</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The Red Ghost Inscription was successfully imprinted into the spirit soul of void general Hong, and Xu Xiaoshou felt a new connection between the two.</p><p>With a thought, he put this powerful existence of the past into the soul space that was opened up after he concluded the Red Ghost Inscription.</p><p>Even if he knelt down on the long street and entered Xu Xiaoshou’s soul space.</p><p>Void general Hong’s gaze was still fixed on the endless enemies. It unconsciously followed its master, Xu Xiaoshou, and roared,</p><p>“Fight! Until the end!”</p><p>“Blood! To the last drop!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
