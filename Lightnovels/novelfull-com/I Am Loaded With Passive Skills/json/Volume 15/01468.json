What kind of method is this?</p><p>“It’s completely different from Yi’s methods. It’s not seducing the seven emotions and six desires at all. Instead, it’s penetrating the spiritual world with incomparable strength. Like a sh*t stirrer, it’s unreasonably disturbing the spiritual will of people.”</p><p>After Xu Xiaoshou calmed down, he determined that there was nothing wrong with his spirit. He even had the time to compare these spiritual attacks with the same approach.</p><p>In the end, he couldn’t come up with a conclusion.</p><p>This was because there was not much difference in the methods used. In terms of the results, as long as the target was changed and the one suffering it was not themselves, most people would be crushed on the spot by this mental attack.</p><p>Disillusionment Finger (charge point: 26.1%)</p><p>The skill bar was filled with the latest information on the Disillusionment Finger.</p><p>Some of the accumulated charge points came from the mental attacks and influences of the small-time enemies he had encountered along the way.</p><p>The second biggest increase was the mental pressure he had to bear when he was facing Jiang Buyi, the demi-saint. This was a comprehensive and indiscriminate mental attack that Jiang Buyi, as a demi-saint, could cause inadvertently.</p><p>After that battle, even if he didn’t fight with a demi-saint, his charge point had increased by several percent.</p><p>However, the greatest increase was in the cultivation deviation caused by the Heart Sword Technique, the Spirit Awakening, and the cultivation deviation.</p><p>As the cycle repeated, the accumulated energy of Disillusionment Finger reached its highest in history, even more than double the 10% when he was killing Yi!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that the Disillusionment Finger at this time had already accumulated into his super killer move.</p><p>All he needed to do was to find the main body of the evil ocean’s will and point it at it. He didn’t even need to test out the Heart Sword Technique to see if he could succeed, and he believed that all the evil and bizarreness would be gone.</p><p>“But it’s a waste, isn’t it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at the percentage and laughed. It was rare to experience cultivation deviation while practicing the Heart Sword Technique. He had originally thought that this would be the only valuable experience he would have in the near future.</p><p>He had never thought that he would taste this sweetness again after dealing with this strange sea.</p><p>“As long as I don’t go crazy and then kill myself or self-destruct, Spirit Awakening will be triggered countless times, and the power accumulation of my Disillusionment Finger can also be increased infinitely.”</p><p>Could this black-purple sea in front of him kill him in an instant?</p><p>Obviously not!</p><p>“Therefore, what I need to do now is not to clean up the pollution in this place as soon as possible, but to slowly find out who the culprit who caused my cultivation deviation is.</p><p>“After all, no matter how dangerous the situation is, I still have two big bodyguards on top of me.</p><p>“This is my second last trump card. If something happens to me, it means that the two of them can’t do anything. If the two of them can’t do anything, who will be in trouble if not me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou loved his life with bodyguards.</p><p>As he thought of this, he allowed his Spirit Awakening to trigger and resist the influence of the evil power of the black-purple sea again and again. At the same time, he dispersed his spiritual power Perception to sense the strange main body.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already recognized the identity of the old woman trapped in the fantasy realm of Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>From the soul memories of the few gold-hunting token assassins he had fought before, he knew that she was another killer who wanted his head, Ghost Granny.</p><p>The only one left with her was the assassin, Elder Xie.</p><p>But that Elder Xie…</p><p>In the memory of the other assassins, they did not seem to have seen this old fellow use such a technique before.</p><p>“Strange, evil, and can cause people to go into cultivation deviation quickly. It’s also different from ordinary mental attacks. This means that it’s very difficult for people to prepare in advance.</p><p>“Furthermore, the power of the ancestral source…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou recalled Master Siren’s words, and his mind became active.</p><p>The cultivation of the Fantasy Sword Technique could be delayed for a while. After all, Xiao Kongtong could teach him at any time.</p><p>In the worst-case scenario, based on the modest character of the ancient swordsmen, Master Siren’s Fantasy Sword Technique might not be the strongest, but he definitely had the qualifications to teach him. Moreover, he must be one of the top few in the world, and this did not include his rich experience in teaching Sword Sutra.</p><p>As for the two people above him, they definitely weren’t as dazed as he was.</p><p>The power of the ancestral source was extremely rare. It was something that even Jiang Buyi would destroy if he could not obtain it.</p><p>Since that was the case, now that he had seen another type of power of the ancestral source in an absolutely safe environment, how could he not think of digging this method over?</p><p>“Your ability is very strong, but soon, it will definitely become mine!</p><p>“Your mistake is that you shouldn’t have appeared in front of me, under the premise that I already have two big bodyguards.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
