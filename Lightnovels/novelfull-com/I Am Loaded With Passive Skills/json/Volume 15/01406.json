It was the most powerful application made by the Demi-Saint after his own interpretation of the Path!</p><p>It was even harder to cultivate than the incarnation of a Demi-Saint and had the most deadly power of ‘guidance’ and ‘interpretation’. The only substitute for it was the ‘Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict’.</p><p>In other words…</p><p>In the world, only the Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict could suppress the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree.</p><p>Except for a few people of the same or lower status, it was basically impossible for them to be rid of the influence of the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree.</p><p>When faced with the most essential interpretation of the Holy Path, those who were focused on the Path would all yearn and try to achieve it.</p><p>This was where Xiao Kongtong and Ye Xiaotian’s strange behavior originated from</p><p>On the other hand, Mei Siren was different from the first two. In the era before the last, he had encountered the Saint before and had also fought against the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree. Thus he was well aware of the level of power here.</p><p>Unfortunately, after he destroyed the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree in his Spiritual World, it was too late for him to advise or stop the two people beside him.</p><p>No one expected Jiang Buyi to leave behind and use such a strong backhanded move after he left. Moreover, he had already lost half of his incarnation.</p><p>This was a greater loss than losing two Demi-Saint incarnations in a row. What was Jiang Buyi after?</p><p>Mei Siren could not figure it out.</p><p>However, he seemed to understand why Jiang Buyi had said so much nonsense before he left.</p><p>That guy had used this discourse to shift everyone’s attention away from him and onto themselves. He tried to divert everyone’s attention so that no one could react in time when the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree was triggered.</p><p>Without a doubt, Jiang Buyi had succeeded!</p><p>In the Arena, when the black and red Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree unfolded in the Nine Heavens, it seemed that only Mei Siren remained clear-headed.</p><p>The rest of the people began to feel dizzy, and looked up involuntarily.</p><p>In Ye Xiaotian’s and Xiao Kongtong’s Spiritual World, this Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree was just like the Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict, that they had seen in the Deep Sea the other time.</p><p>In fact, Xiao Kongtong had not even experienced the Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict which his Teacher had sent.</p><p>However, at this moment, he looked up at the sky and realized his insignificance.</p><p>His Spiritual World was completely filled with the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree, which contained the Demi-Saint’s most extreme condensation of the Holy Path. There were not much contents in it, only one word:</p><p>‘Return!’</p><p>What was ‘return’?</p><p>“The vanity of the world began from chaos; the chaos of dust originated from nothing.”</p><p>“The Path is plain, the Saint refers to the true heart. Like the uncut jade, the humble self returns to its true origins.”</p><p>The Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree only had one condensed word, ‘return’. Those who saw the Demi-Saint’s true work heard the Saint Language which drifted into their ears.</p><p>These Demi-Saints’ interpretation of the word ‘return’ was embedded deeply in the minds of everyone who looked at the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree. It was like a loud bell that washed away one’s soul.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian immediately spat out a mouthful of blood; his vitality was greatly damaged.</p><p>Unlike the Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict, which was only the declaration of power, the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree before him was more like a command.</p><p>It commanded all those who were interested in the Path to remove all their disguises and return to their true selves. Only then could they be in touch with the human heart and achieve the creed of ‘not to seek happiness from things and not to feel sorry for themselves’. From there, they would be able to seek the Holy Path.</p><p>“I was wrong…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s eyes were filled with regret.</p><p>He finally understood that when he left the Holy Palace and established the Spirit Palace, it was a hidden seal of his own heart.</p><p>After he saw the upper worlds, he was now tired of the power struggles. However, the method he chose to resist was to escape. He did not maintain his pure nature and use his strength to pursue the Path.</p><p>As a result, after more than ten years, he was finally able to see his true self and achieve a long-overdue breakthrough.</p><p>And now, he deceived himself again!</p><p>The battle between Demi-Saints was not something he could interfere with at his current level. However, in order to get into the game, he swallowed the Holy Blood and forcibly interfered.</p><p>This kind of greed for external things, thirst for shortcuts, and struggles to gain power was not how one achieved the Path and become a Saint!</p><p>People should ‘return’ to the real world.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian spat out another mouthful of blood as soon as this thought flashed through his mind.</p><p>This time, he didn’t just spit out blood. The Power Upanishad Formation under his feet spun and showed signs of cracking.</p><p>At the same time, the external power he had begged for – the Holy Blood-turned into a mass of thick Holy Power and spread from his body.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian seemed to have aged by several decades in an instant. Wrinkles and black age spots appeared on his body.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Ye Xiaotian’s interpretation of the Path and his yearning to be a Saint had transformed into ‘over-interpretation’,’ over-infatuation’, ‘greed’ and ‘loss’. All of these traits manifested fully in Ye Xiaotian.</p><p>“I was really wrong…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was filled with regret and even wanted to sacrifice his life so he could return to his roots.</p><p>He stretched out his hands and stabbed them into his chest. He wanted to tear open his flesh and blood, gouge his heart and lungs out and prove himself to the Heavens and Earth. He would turn himself into chaos and return to the most original state of a Saint and the Path – nothingness!</p><p>“Foolish!”</p><p>At this moment, a ferocious monster rushed into Ye Xiaotian’s Spirit World. His mind had followed in the wake of Yama’s footsteps and his body had already left the world of mortals.</p><p>The monster was cut down by a single blow of the sharp-edged sword.</p><p>“The Path of Man, the Path of Nature, only then can one become a Saint!”</p><p>However, a person is a person, the Path is the Path and a Saint is a Saint. The three of them could not be mentioned in the same breath. To seek the Path of the Saint and transform into a Saint would turn into a cultivation of chaos!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
