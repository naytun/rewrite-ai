There’s a small difficulty right now…”</p><p>“Of course, I know that for you, this isn’t a challenge at all, but for me, it’s a small hurdle. We’re friends, and we need to help each other.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled,</p><p>“Next, I’ll send you out to deal with a minor character.”</p><p>“She’s also an expert in the Dao of the soul. In the past, she wanted to kill me. But isn’t killing me the same as killing you? I can’t stand it!”</p><p>“We can’t let her go. Let’s take this opportunity to see how much combat power you have left. This way, we can better formulate a training plan to recover your realm and improve your cultivation so that we can deal with the final great demon, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stuck his head out and asked, waiting for void general Hong to give a definite answer.</p><p>However, void general Hong surprisingly didn’t respond.</p><p>“Fight! Until the end!”</p><p>“Blood! To the last drop!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly raised his arms and roared loudly. He quickly continued, “If you want to help me, then shout with me.”</p><p>It was definitely not because of the interruption, but because he wanted to help his friend. Void general Hong suddenly looked up at the sky.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled in satisfaction.</p><p>This was how good friends should help each other.</p><p>The moment before he left the soul space, he thought for a moment and finally said,</p><p>“I’ll call you ‘Hong’ from now on. It’s more intimate this way. Don’t worry. When everyone has grown up, I’ll find a way to help you fulfill your obsession.”</p><p>“You probably don’t know yet, but you actually have three long-lost younger brothers and sisters. They are… I’ll introduce you to them in the future. You’ll also build a bond and become good friends.”</p><p>“Alright, my Teacher is getting anxious. See you later. I’m looking forward to your battle.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved goodbye with a smile and left the ward-like soul space.</p><p>…</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>On the long street, night fell once more. Xiao Kongtong had once again used the Fantasy Sword Technique to trap this world, restraining Ghost Granny who was eager to escape.</p><p>As for Mei Siren…</p><p>At this moment, the old Sword Deity was shaking Xu Xiaoshou, whose eyes were dull and listless. His heart was full of worry.</p><p>“Is he possessed?”</p><p>“I knew it. This kid only knows how to mess around. In the future, I definitely can’t let him mess around!”</p><p>Just as he was thinking about this, he saw Xu Xiaoshou, who had stopped in front of the void general portrait, let out a few strange cries. He suddenly trembled and was unable to move after forming the Red Ghost Inscription.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>The three people who were paying close attention to Xu Xiaoshou were surprised.</p><p>Ghost Granny was praying madly in her heart that something would happen. The best result was that Xu Xiaoshou’s spirit soul would be possessed, and the worst result was that Xu Xiaoshou would fail to sign the Red Ghost Inscription contract and die from the backlash.</p><p>She couldn’t accept that Xu Xiaoshou had reached such a high level after only one practice of the Phantom Swords Technique!</p><p>If this kid really managed to form a contract with the void general, how would they fight the next battle?</p><p>Ghost Granny didn’t even need to think to know how powerful one of the three void generals who could command all the void attendants was, even if he was only a spirit soul!</p><p>But often…</p><p>Things didn’t go as she wished!</p><p>Just as Mei Siren was wondering why there was such a big movement on Xu Xiaoshou’s body, he realized that it was a good sign.</p><p>He was the closest to Xu Xiaoshou, and he could tell from Xu Xiaoshou’s rapidly rising aura that he had successfully signed the Red Ghost Inscription contract. Now, he was probably receiving the void general’s soul energy.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Overjoyed, Mei Siren immediately used his sword image to protect Xu Xiaoshou. He even glanced at Ghost Granny coldly.</p><p>Even if they didn’t speak, everyone knew what this look meant. “You’d better not cause any trouble.”</p><p>Ghost Granny trembled.</p><p>Not to mention that she didn’t dare to mess around, when she saw the change in Xu Xiaoshou’s aura, she was only worried about the upcoming battle.</p><p>Victory…</p><p>If she fought with Xu Xiaoshou, she would definitely win.</p><p>But she would definitely die if she fought the void general!</p><p>“That’s impossible. How did things turn out like this?” she wondered.</p><p>Ghost Granny scratched her head in confusion. Didn’t Xu Xiaoshou just start cultivating the Phantom Swords Technique? How could he be so lucky to contract such a powerful spirit soul?</p><p>“Possession! He must be possessed!”</p><p>“Breakthrough failed, cultivation deviation!”</p><p>“The spirit soul is too strong. It’s not listening to him!”</p><p>“The backlash of the spirit soul will end the breakthrough. Xu Xiaoshou will die suddenly… Keep it up! You must develop in the direction I predicted! You must!”</p><p>Cursed, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Cursed, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>The information bar jumped up and down.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>On the long street, a burst of spiritual source fluctuations disrupted Ghost Granny’s curse.</p><p>She trembled and looked over. She found that Xu Xiaoshou, who was under the protection of Mei Siren, no longer had a dull look in his eyes. After he opened his eyes, his eyes were full of vigor!</p><p>“Wretched heavens, why do you treat me like this? Why?!” Ghost Granny’s eyes were about to pop out of their sockets. The power of her soul body was in chaos, and it even showed signs of collapsing.</p><p>“How is it?” On the other side, Mei Siren asked with concern.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his right hand. His eyes were fixed, and he clenched his palm a few times. He felt the terrifying improvement brought by the soul power. His lips curled up, and a smile appeared on his face.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
