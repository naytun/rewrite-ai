In addition, the core of Dragon Apricot had the attribute of self-defense and counterattack. Anyone trying to pick the Dragon Apricot would be in trouble, so there should be fine.</p><p>It was different for Blood World!</p><p>Every time Abyss Island opened, Blood World would devour many Spirit Cultivators.</p><p>Yan Wuse had already investigated everything. The last time the seal on the inner island loosened, he suspected that a ghost beast was hiding in Blood World and lured an invader from the outside world. After successfully parasitizing the ghost beast, it escaped from Abyss Island.</p><p>This time, the key might be at the center of the chaos, Blood World!</p><p>“Blood World Pearl,” Yan Wuse muttered silently, hoping no accidents would happen.</p><p>Fortunately, although many people were entering the island this time, completely breaking the previous record, most were at the higher void level and couldn’t contact the core of every extreme ground.</p><p>Yan Wuse looked down and then looked away. For some reason, he felt as if he had missed something. However, the sensation disappeared the next second.</p><p>“Let’s go to Blood World first!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>He came in a hurry and left in the same way.</p><p>Below, Reverend Huang Yang, with his tattered clothes wet with blood and sweat, felt the two terrifying Auras leaving. He waited a long time before he dared to get up, his heart full of fear.</p><p>“It’s too terrifying. Two demi-saints appeared at the same time…”</p><p>At the side, Elder Xie and Ghost Granny also crawled up in shock, their faces filled with horror.</p><p>“D*mn it! Luckily I hid right away. Otherwise, this Blood Tree’s Yin Branch would have attracted the attention of the demi-saint.” Elder Xie whipped his head.</p><p>“Come on. It’s just a Blood Tree’s Yin Branch. Maybe the demi-saint doesn’t even care about it.” Ghost Granny sneered, but her expression soon turned serious. “Stop talking about the demi-saint, or we will be exposed.”</p><p>Elder Xie’s body trembled, but he nodded. He then turned to look at the other side of the long street and asked again in a low voice, “So? Reverend Huang Yang? You’ve seen the danger of Sky City. Do you want to go with us?”</p><p>Reverend Huang Yang, who had pulled away from Elder Xie and Ghost Granny, didn’t want to return. He shook his head and said, “No, I’m used to traveling alone. Farewell!”</p><p>A red light flashed in his eyes as he subconsciously chose a direction to leave.</p><p>“You’re worried about us?” Ghost Granny suddenly said.</p><p>“Yes!” Reverend Huang Yang stopped and turned around. He smiled and said, “I’ll pay my debt of gratitude one day, but would you be at ease if you were me?”</p><p>With that, his figure flickered, and he disappeared on the spot.</p><p>“Should we do something?” Ghost Granny tilted her head.</p><p>Elder Xie looked at the disappearing afterimages in the distance and looked up at the sky. He sighed and said, “Forget it. The demi-saint has just left. Don’t cause trouble. The higher void level cultivator has put his guard up, so we can’t even sneak attack. How do we even fight against him?”</p><p>“Two against one!” Ghost Granny licked her lips, but she was still thinking about the blood-colored pearl.</p><p>“If he risks his life, he can kill one of us! Don’t forget that when Blood Sea swallowed everything, he ran out with the pearl safe and sound. Perhaps he has been hiding his strength.” Elder Xie didn’t dare to take the risk.</p><p>“Maybe it was all about the pearl?” Ghost Granny disagreed.</p><p>“Anyway, I’m not ready to die, so I won’t go!” Elder Xie returned and took out the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch. “I’m already very satisfied with this. Let’s focus on sacrificial refining the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch, and I think it’s the best for both of us,” he chuckled and said.</p><p>“Ha, you are becoming an old coward.” Ghost Granny sneered, but she didn’t refute him and left with Elder Xie quickly.</p><p>The ancient city was desolate, as if it had been lifeless since the beginning of this world.</p><p>As they walked around the city, they felt more and more panicked. Meanwhile, the fear of the unknown and enormity was hunting them.</p><p>Before knowing it, they had passed through countless zones, and there were still more ahead, as if there was no end.</p><p>Ghost Granny and Elder Xie had stopped talking a long time ago. The crisp sound of their footsteps echoed in the quiet giant kingdom. Ultimately, the two stopped walking and started to fly, not daring to make a single sound.</p><p>“Thud”</p><p>Suddenly, Ghost Granny stopped and landed on the ground.</p><p>“What happened?” Elder Xie was on guard and immediately looked over.</p><p>“Three soul auras…” Ghost Granny subconsciously wanted to use her spiritual sense to scan it, but the horror from the demi-saint earlier came to her mind and made her stop.</p><p>“Don’t use your spiritual senses. Take out your Spiritual Banner.” Elder Xie knew what she was worried about.</p><p>Ghost Granny nodded, took out a dark and cold banner, made a hand seal, and sent it into the object.</p><p>Soon, three blurry and illusory human faces appeared on the Spiritual Banner.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Elder Xie’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>He didn’t recognize the two more mature faces on the side, but the young one in the middle was very familiar!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Ghost Granny and Elder Xie looked at each other, having surprised looks on their faces.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“This is a gift from the universe!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
