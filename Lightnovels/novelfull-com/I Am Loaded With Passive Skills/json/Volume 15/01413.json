The three thousand feet tall black super giant was almost completely on the ground. Then, he stretched out his right hand in front of everyone. His five fingers closed and and made a gesture which signified the blooming of a flower.</p><p>“Open the hole in your brain…”</p><p>“What!”</p><p>This sentence seemed to have the power to freeze time, and the three of them were petrified.</p><p>After they remained stunned for a long time, some of them finally came back to their senses.</p><p>“What the heck!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was on the verge of going insane. He wiped away the tears on his face. He was happy, angry and embarrassed at the same time. He wished he could kick the Void Attendant away, but at the same time, he wanted to hug this adorable chap tightly and savor the joy of his good friend’s disciple’s resurrection.</p><p>However, after taking into consideration his own height and the Void Attendant’s physique, Ye Xiaotian abandoned the idea.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is not dead, he’s still alive!”</p><p>However, he had been cursed and turned into a Void Attendant. It was like the Prince in the mortal fairy tale who had turned into a toad.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was overjoyed.</p><p>It was good that he didn’t die, and he could be saved.</p><p>It didn’t matter it was just an illusion or a dramatic turn of events, as long as you didn’t die, everything would be fine.</p><p>The three of them arrived at this conclusion at the same time.</p><p>Even so, he looked at the big guy in front of him and then glanced again at the actual Xu Xiaoshou, who even managed to deceive the Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi…</p><p>It was a clear day, yet it seemed like an illusion.</p><p>This feeling was too obscure!</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“How did you do it?”</p><p>“What did you do in the midst of this battle?”</p><p>Their minds were filled with endless questions, but the three of them didn’t voice them.</p><p>The tragic ending of Jiang Buyi’s counterattack was still vivid in their minds. No one knew if the Demi-Saint had any other tricks left.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already exchanged half of his life to teach the three of them a bloody lesson.</p><p>No matter how strong he was, even if he controlled the situation, he couldn’t slack off when he encountered a Saint. If the Demi-Saint wanted to flee he couldn’t stop him. If he wanted to make a move, he couldn’t stop him either.</p><p>Without the certainty of absolute certainty, if they should relax their vigilance at any time, even if it was just a little, would only lead to death!</p><p>To be able to live to this age, which one of them wasn’t like a wily old fox?</p><p>At this moment, everyone realized that they had been taught a lesson by a junior who used them as an example. Their faces burned with embarrassment.</p><p>Therefore, they were naturally not stupid enough to give any names or give out any information while Xu Xiaoshou still used the Void Attendant’s body to communicate with them.</p><p>“Let’s talk somewhere else.”</p><p>Mei Siren tried his best to calm everyone down and carefully constructed the Higher Void World. Then, the three of them used telepathic communication to converse with each other.</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou’s future Teacher, he had been taught a lesson by this student!</p><p>Mei Siren had not figured out the principle of this lesson yet!</p><p>“Is this an example of ‘The Golden Cicada left its shell’?”</p><p>“No, in this instance, it is the ‘Giant Cicada that shed its shell!’ How did he do it?”</p><p>Before they entered the Arena, Mei Siren thought about how Xu Xiashou would solve the situation. He treated it as the first lesson at school and would use it to educate the students.</p><p>Now, they found that Xu Xiaoshou’s realm was not inferior to theirs at all, and was even better than theirs – he had even managed to trick the Demi-Saint Jiang Buyi!</p><p>No!</p><p>It should be said that in this round, everyone had been tricked by Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>He had been played in such a incomprehensible manner that he had turned from being a chess player into a chess piece. The biggest mastermind behind the scenes had only revealed himself in the Void Attendant’s body at this moment.</p><p>This kid, other than his mediocre strength, had no other weakness!</p><p>“Master Siren is right.”</p><p>“Let’s leave first,”</p><p>The two of them who stood beside him nodded in agreement; they no longer dared to stay any longer in this accursed place.</p><p>Apart from the fact that Jiang Buyi might have some other tricks up his sleeve, the Ultimate Attribute of the Forest of Miracles, which had been suppressed by the battle between the Demi-Saints, had awakened and reactivated again.</p><p>The Void Attendant was the only one who did not nod in agreement.</p><p>He turned his head slightly and stared at Mei Siren with blazing eyes, “The humans… did not go through… calamity?”</p><p>What calamity!</p><p>Mei Siren was so angry that he laughed.</p><p>“You’re not dead. I already encountered a Saint. Do I need to risk my life to fight Jiang Buyi?”</p><p>Then the karma would be huge and meaningless. It would just be a brainless act!</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Mei Siren had just started to speak to explain what he meant.</p><p>All of a sudden, he saw a hint of mockery in the two big eyes in the huge face in front of him, as it waggled its eyebrows playfully at him.</p><p>“You brat!”</p><p>Mei Siren’s face turned red.</p><p>So it wasn’t that Xu Xiaoshou was not aware of the reason, but that he wanted to tease Mei Siren!</p><p>How dare he!</p><p>Mei Siren gritted his teeth in anger, but he was also helpless. “Let’s go first. I will deal with you later.”</p><p>“Wu…” the Void Attendant shook his head, glanced at the trio and turned to leave.</p><p>“What was it doing?”</p><p>The three of them were taken aback. How dare Xu Xiaoshou stay here?</p><p>They followed the direction he went and discovered that Xu Xiaoshou headed toward another Void Attendant.</p><p>Under the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree, the hundreds of stone giants who had no intelligence and only knew how to guard the treasures had lost most of their Spiritual Intelligence. They turned into endless mountains and slept in the Forest of Miracles forever.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
