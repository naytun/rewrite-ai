He even managed to befriend a Void Attendant?</p><p>This absurd and dramatic scene in the distance felt so surreal, but it also opened the door of the dusty memories of the three bystanders, which made them recall traces of Xu Xiaoshou’s various ‘trickery’.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian and Xiao Kongtong suddenly had these recollections.</p><p>When they were watching the battle between the Demi-Saints, there was indeed only one Void Attendant in the Arena. Besides the hundreds of Stone Giants, there were no other Void Attendants who went after them.</p><p>This so-called second ‘Void Attendant’ had entered the Arena when the two of them made their appearance. Then Bazhun’an appeared and just when everyone’s attention was diverted, the Stone Giants followed suit and surrounded the battleground.</p><p>At this time, in order to reap benefits from the confusion, another unobtrusive Void Attendant of average size, sneaked in from among the countless tall giants. Its main purpose was to save its companion, the other Void Attendant.</p><p>This was perfectly normal!</p><p>The three of them didn’t find anything strange about this.</p><p>Even now, when he thought about it, he felt that it was only natural!</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou could stir up trouble, why couldn’t the Void Attendant?</p><p>Mei Siren sighed.</p><p>Now that he thought about it, he didn’t sense that anything was amiss then.</p><p>At that time, everyone’s attention was centered on Bazhun’an. Even Jiang Buyi thought it was normal and did not realize that Xu Xiaoshou had already entered the Arena. This was simply terrifying!</p><p>Why did he say it was ‘terrifying’?</p><p>At that time, when everyone had let their guard down, Xu Xiaoshou already knew that something bad was going to happen to him. He could even die!</p><p>However, he had openly dispelled his Disappearing State and joined the battle. It had clearly been so unexpected and harsh, but he had still been able to do it silently.</p><p>When one thought about it…</p><p>“The most dangerous place is also the safest place.” Xiao Kongtong closed his eyes as he accepted this fact.</p><p>“He guessed it. He’s more afraid of death than anyone else. He had already prepared for the next step well in advance. Ye Xiaotian sighed and thought, “I should just accept it.”</p><p>“Was he merely being smart? He seemed to have mastered the ability to predict the future. Mei Siren didn’t know how to evaluate this chap.</p><p>Every time he appeared, his perception of this guy would be refreshed. Was there no limit to this person’s capabilities?</p><p>How old was he? How could he be so sinister, cunning, vicious, and ruthless? It seemed these traits were usually not used to describe his own people?</p><p>Mei Siren thought for a moment. Perhaps it should be termed as ‘strategizing’ or ‘being prepared for a rainy day’?</p><p>He felt that in terms of operation, layout, and the use of evil schemes, he had to accept and acknowledge it all.</p><p>And now!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had bested the three of them psychologically, swaggered into the other Void Attendant’s embrace in his Void Attendant body.</p><p>No one thought that he was fooling around.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s actions must have an underlying meaning!</p><p>You can’t just think of one level, you have to think of three levels! Five levels!</p><p>“He, what is he up to now?”</p><p>…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
