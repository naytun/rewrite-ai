You can only destroy all of his protective shields and force him into a corner, cut up his physical body, destroy his soul and his will.”</p><p>“Only when you use a technique that can surpass the higher void level to deal with him can you then wipe him out completely. Of course, this is only a possibility.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi was also amused. His lips twitched as he said, “Since you’ve watched the battle in the Forest of Miracles, you would know that I’ve left behind a Demi-Saint’s will and a Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree. He has been wiped out without any hope of a possible resurrection.”</p><p>“Is that so?” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man looked at him and said, “But when I left the Forest of Miracles, I saw two Void Attendants and three of Xu Xiaoshou’s protectors. Even Mu Ling of the Holy Palace watched the battle from a distance. Make a guess which one was he?”</p><p>Thump!</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Buyi’s heart skipped a beat and he was stunned. “You, what do you mean?”</p><p>“I don’t mean anything. You’re on the same level as Rao Yaoyao, the ruler of the red-clothed people from the Holy Divine Palace. You were given a chance but you didn’t grasp it. No one should be blamed. Let’s go. You will only be sad if we continue this conversation.” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man walked away.</p><p>Jiang Buyi took a long time to recover. He still could not believe it!</p><p>However, since the Five Decays of Heaven and Man said so, he was happy to go along with it and he spoke to him from a distance, “Even if he’s not dead, why were you looking for him?”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s ears pricked up and he said impatiently, “So, why did you have such a lengthy fight with him? You are still not aware that he might have the Three Loathsome Eyes you threw out as bait? Don’t you know there was a Divine Being by his side?”</p><p>He stopped talking.</p><p>However, Jiang Buyi was already stunned by the information that was revealed.</p><p>“Three Loathsome Eyes?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou has that?”</p><p>“Wasn’t it on the person in front of him?” Jiang Buyi suddenly had a thought and realized something.</p><p>From the start to the end, he had only seen one of the Three Loathsome Eyes in the right eye of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. What about the other?</p><p>He remembered the message that Jiang Xian had sent him. The Three Loathsome Eyes was divided between two major factions. One was Yama and the other was the Saint Servant. So that was how it was!</p><p>Jiang Buyi thought about this and hurried after the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. Obviously, he had been convinced and asked again, “So, how did you know that Xu Xiaoshou would be at the First Hall of Sins?”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man stopped and looked over in surprise. “So, your fight with with Xu Xiaoshou was not over the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi was speechless.</p><p>“What are you talking about?”</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man suddenly burst into laughter again; he laughed so much, it seemed as if his tears were about to flow out. “You don’t have to explain further. I understand everything.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi could clearly hear the mocking tone in the laughter. He did not ask further because it was obvious the other party did not want to talk about it. Finally, he confirmed, “You want to get the Three Loathsome Eyes from Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“That’s right.” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man calmed down. He nodded and whispered, “Why do you think I stayed with Yama? I only have one of the Three Loathsome Eyes. No matter how powerful it is, it can only affect Spiritual Cultivators of the same level. But with both of them, I can control Demi-Saints at the higher void level. What do you think I’m after?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi did not speak, but it was obvious that he had something on his mind. He followed the person in front closely.</p><p>“You’re thinking about your bait, right?”</p><p>As they talked and laughed, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had already entered the city of Giants. On the vast streets, he spotted his target and strode forward.</p><p>“Don’t worry, if you don’t dare to wear the Three Loathsome Eyes, I’m happy to be your test subject. When you think the time is right, you can take it back. That’s not a problem.”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man laughed. “Our cooperation was only a verbal agreement after all. We can dissolve the agreement at any time.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi was slightly stunned. He was not used to this guy’s sudden candidness.</p><p>“You need to understand that if you want to attack me, I don’t know when I’ll retaliate. So, you have to be on your guard against me.” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man turned to look at him.</p><p>“Ha!” Jiang Buyi sneered. Would he not be on guard against this?</p><p>“Ha.”</p><p>On the empty street, the sound of footsteps suddenly stopped and echoed in the silence.</p><p>Jiang Buyi almost crashed into the Five Decays of Heaven and Man who had stopped so abruptly.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” He asked.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was silent. He slowly turned around, and the corners of his mouth under the mask curled into a sneer. After a long time, he said, “I know you like to chat with me, and I know I told you to follow me, but please remember to keep your distance.”</p><p>After a pause, he stretched out his hand and brushed away the weeds that inadvertently appeared on Jiang Buyi’s shoulders. “I don’t want to have to contain the power of decay for you all the time. Since you are on the alert, remember to be wary of my ability too, Demi-Saint Jiang.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi seemed to have woken up from a dream and lowered his head.</p><p>Without his knowledge, the marks of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had once again infected his entire body!</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>Suddenly, thunder rumbled in the Nine Heavens. Jiang Buyi looked up in shock. The sky was covered with dark clouds. The Saint Calamity was about to happen, but he was not aware at all!</p><p>Bad luck made people forget about the approach of death!</p><p>“D*mn it!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi was frightened and suddenly retreated and kept a distance of a mile between the two of them.</p><p>After he maintained this distance, he looked up at the long street in the city of Giants.</p><p>Between the vast and towering city towers, a solitary figure cast a short, slanted gray shadow under the sunlight. The orange-masked man, who was as insignificant as an ant, turned around and continued to move forward indifferently.</p><p>This person was clearly so small!</p><p>However, wherever he passed, the city walls within a radius of several miles became mottled, the vegetation withered, and the gravel shattered into dust.</p><p>“The Lone Star of Heaven…”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s expression was grave. Once again, he realized how dangerous this person was.</p><p>He suddenly wondered what would happen to him if he cooperated with this guy. Could a Demi-Saint overcome such a fate?</p><p>Even though his ability was suppressed by the spirit of the Abyss Island, Jiang Buyi could go anywhere on the Abyss Island.</p><p>However, the appearance of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was like a variable. At this moment, even he felt that he could no longer control his fate.</p><p>“What are you thinking about?”</p><p>While he was deep in thought, a hoarse voice drifted into his ears. The calm voice of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man could be heard.</p><p>“Follow me, but please be careful.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
