Even he felt that Xu Xiaoshou had no chance of winning this battle.</p><p>But victory or defeat did not matter.</p><p>In the eyes of Mei Siren, as long as he was under strong pressure, not to mention the Spirits Controlling, as long as Xu Xiaoshou could quickly master the Phantom Swords Technique, given his age and time, he would definitely be able to reach the top.</p><p>As soon as he spoke, Xu Xiaoshou looked over.</p><p>Ghost Granny was no exception. Her soul body’s ears pricked up and she was a little surprised that this old Sword Deity didn’t hide any of his sword secrets from her. Instead, he was so noble and upright.</p><p>Very good!</p><p>This was the Ancient Swordsman indeed!</p><p>Ghost Granny did not intend to secretly cultivate the Phantom Swords Technique. She was aware of her own strength.</p><p>However, since Mei Siren spoke so clearly, she did not need to eavesdrop and use it against Xu Xiaoshou’s next move. That would be letting down the noble character of the Ancient Swordsman!</p><p>Mei Siren was obviously aware of Ghost Granny’s plan, but he still did not use any telepathic communication. He was impartial and spoke openly.</p><p>“The first step is to enter the path of All Things are Swords and have a profound sense of the ‘spirit of all things’. All things have spirits, regardless if they are alive or dead. Those with different spiritual perception and souls from ordinary people can do this easily. Those who lack talent will never be able to enter the door.”</p><p>His body floated in the air, his clothes fluttered in the wind, and his Sword Will rose with his words.</p><p>Not long after, this Fantasy Realm became distorted under the influence of the Sword Will. Everything seemed to have received an edict. The sand rose and fell and the wind stilled.</p><p>“Rise.”</p><p>Mei Siren raised his hand.</p><p>The sand on the long streets, the moss on the building walls, and even the tiny creatures that floated in the air were all drawn out and emitted speckles of light in the gloom.</p><p>“This is the ‘spirit’!”</p><p>Ghost Granny’s pupils trembled. From the soul refinement of his Spiritual Cultivation, she already had a basic understanding of Mei Siren’s move.</p><p>Everything in the world had a ‘spirit’ and when the ‘spirit’ was formed, it could give rise to a ‘spiritual physique’ and ‘spiritual intelligence’.</p><p>The simplest example was that after an elixir had undergone a long period of nurturing, once the grade reached a certain rank, it was possible for it to develop spiritual intelligence and become a treasure that could cultivate on its own and able to seek good fortune and avoid disaster.</p><p>For example, when one of the Nine Great Ancestral Trees, the Dragon Apricot, gets blood, its status would be raised to the highest level.</p><p>However, this was the path of evolution for a strong lifeform.</p><p>For non-living and weak living beings, to go from ‘no spirit’ to ‘birth of spirit’ to ‘forming spirit’ would probably take millions of years.</p><p>It was not impossible for gravel, or even mayflies to gain spiritual intelligence, but it was probably a one in a billion chance.</p><p>A fully formed soul body was easy to find, and Ghost Granny could easily find one too.</p><p>However, the unformed ‘spirit’ was now being pulled out from the sand and the wind. Ghost Granny was shocked when she saw that.</p><p>She was quite skilled in the Way of the Soul, but she didn’t think she could find such a weak ‘spirit’ as easily as Mei Siren!</p><p>And now…</p><p>For an Ancient Swordsman, this was only one of the three main requirements of the Phantom Swords Technique?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was going to meet Mei Siren’s requirements and achieve his realm despite not having any contact with such things before?</p><p>Ghost Granny suddenly felt that the world was like a joke. It was a little too funny!</p><p>No wonder…</p><p>No wonder the Swordsman Association was extinct.</p><p>Oh, no, it couldn’t be considered extinct. Weren’t there still two big bosses left in front of her?</p><p>However, it was not without reason that the Swordsman Association was on the verge of extinction in today’s era!</p><p>Ghost Granny looked quizzically at Xu Xiaoshou. She wanted to see what this guy could learn.</p><p>After she heard what Mei Siren said, she was confused. She didn’t believe that Xu Xiaoshou could master the ‘spirit summoning technique’ just by listening to one sentence without even learning the ‘mental cultivation method’, ‘formula’ ‘techniques’, and so on.</p><p>“This is the ‘spirit’.”</p><p>Mei Siren’s eyes swept across Ghost Granny’s soul body and her expression which had changed from shock to amusement. His gaze fell on Xu Xiaoshou, but he did not say much and only explained with one sentence.</p><p>For the Ancient Swordsman, there were many things that could only be understood but not described in words.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou’s soul body was not strong enough and his All Things are Swords was not strong enough to sense the ‘spirit’, it would be useless no matter what Mei Siren said. They could only let Xu Xiaoshou continue to practice from the basics.</p><p>However, it was clear from Xu Xiaoshou’s Present Gods and Buddhas that he had a solid foundation.</p><p>If his soul body was not strong, his spiritual body would not be strong, and he would not have been able to visualize such a terrifying imagery of the Present Gods and Buddhas without suffering any backlash!</p><p>“This is the ‘spirit’.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even need to wait for an explanation.</p><p>As soon as Master Siren raised his hand, the knowledge in his mind was mobilized. He also knew how to do it, the principle behind it, and how it became one of the three great thresholds for the practice of the ‘Phantom Swords Technique’.</p><p>“Is this the way?”</p><p>When he saw Ghost Granny’s mocking gaze, Xu Xiaoshou pondered for a moment, then he raised his right hand high in the air, just like Master Siren.</p><p>“Rise!”</p><p>With a whoosh, it was as if the entire street had been lit up by thousands of lights at the same time and the air was filled with countless ‘spirits’.</p><p>That bright radiance was like a firefly’s light that competed with the bright moon!</p><p>Mei Siren’s hands trembled, and his expression froze.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s jaw dropped and then closed again and he almost bit off the tip of his tongue.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
