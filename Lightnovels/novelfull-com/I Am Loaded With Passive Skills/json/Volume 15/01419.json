It was afraid that its old friend would be immersed in its past memories, and it would not be able to adapt to the situation.</p><p>However, in the face of this question, the void attendant couldn’t find an answer for a while.</p><p>“I don’t know,” It shook its head slightly.</p><p>The loss of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer this time was not as simple as losing a few stalks of spiritual herbs. The entire garden had disappeared.</p><p>The crime involved was too great!</p><p>The void attendant reckoned that it would have to visit the First Hall of Sins to ask for forgiveness, and then it might have to go to the Holy Execution Ground later. However, it would bear all the punishment itself!</p><p>In order to save it, its old friend almost risked their life. There was no reason for its old friend to share its dereliction of duty.</p><p>The void attendant believed that if it told its old friend everything, this old friend would definitely choose to die together with it. However, it didn’t want this to happen.</p><p>It would bear its mistake. It thought, “Old friend, you’ve just woken up. You should take a good trip to Abyss Island and visit your old home.”</p><p>“How about you?” The void attendant changed the topic. It wanted to call out its old friend’s name, but it couldn’t. “My friend…Where are you going next?”.</p><p>“Me?” Xu Xiaoshou had been waiting for this question for a long time. He turned his head and looked at the three humans behind him. “I already have a mission. I’ll part with you next. Although I’m reluctant, I have to.”</p><p>The ‘mission’ he mentioned was naturally the mission to ‘kill Double Dumba*s’, which was given to him by the void attendant that day.</p><p>However, these words had a different meaning in the void attendant’s ears.</p><p>Mission?</p><p>The void attendant was stunned for a moment, but then it realized that the old friend who had just woken up might have been seen by the spirit of the Abyss Island because it had saved it. Now, its old friend would be entrusted with greater responsibility.</p><p>“Is it related to the three humans?” The void attendant followed his gaze.</p><p>“Yes.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded. Of course, he had to bring Master Siren and the others away. It was best to use the mission as a cover.</p><p>He also believed that the void attendant knew the boundaries and would not ask him what the mission was.</p><p>Of course, even if the other party asked, Xu Xiaoshou would have countermeasures.</p><p>In the end, the void attendant didn’t ask any further questions.</p><p>This was because it knew that the spirit of the Abyss Island gave each guardian a different task, and these tasks were all confidential.</p><p>At this time, it was still in deep thought, and the only thing on its mind was…</p><p>“Brother, you just saved my life, but I have to part with you before I can repay you. Moreover, you have accepted the mission from the spirit of Abyss Island and are going to travel with these three humans. Now, you have your own mission to complete and humans to instruct…”</p><p>In an instant, the void attendant thought of how to repay the favor.</p><p>“My friend, you just woke up, your things…”</p><p>As soon as he said this, Xu Xiaoshou was so excited that he almost held up the big cute head in front of him and kissed it.</p><p>He thought silently, “I haven’t even started guiding you, and you’re already thinking of repaying my kindness by giving me treasures?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suppressed the joy in his heart and said sorrowfully, “Human! Detestable! When I woke up from my deep sleep, everything was stolen away.”</p><p>As expected!</p><p>The void attendant was overjoyed. It knew that its old friend must have suffered the same fate as it.</p><p>Abyss Island had not been peaceful in recent years. There were always human sneaks who stole treasures from all over.</p><p>Who knew how many treasures had been lost in the Nine Extreme Grounds? Its friend had been asleep for so long, and no matter how strong the restrictions were, they couldn’t be stronger than the Nine Extreme Grounds. All its savings must have been stolen!</p><p>“Friend, since you’re traveling with the humans, you will be issuing them a mission.”</p><p>The void attendant paused for a moment. “The rule of Abyss Island is an equivalent exchange. You’re penniless now, so you can’t issue any missions. Although I don’t have much savings, you must accept these.”</p><p>As it spoke, it flipped its hand, and a small pile of black hexagonal crystals appeared in its huge palm.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Void crystals!</p><p>This was what he wanted!</p><p>With a sweep of his ‘perception’, Xu Xiaoshou instantly counted the number of void crystals in the void attendant’s hands.</p><p>…50!</p><p>Damn it, he only got two pills as a reward for killing Double Dumba*s.</p><p>Yet this giant gave him so much just for a little trickery?</p><p>What were these?</p><p>Were these really the void crystals?</p><p>No! This was the lives of 25 higher voids!</p><p>Moreover, the rewards for killing Double Dumba*s were for two. If he was to take on the void attendant mission alone, that would be the lives of 50 higher voids!</p><p>However, that was what he thought.</p><p>“No, no, no. Brother, you’re treating me as an outsider. I didn’t save you just for these things,” Xu Xiaoshou said as he pushed the void attendant’s hand back with all his might.</p><p>The giant race could destroy a higher void with a kick and a mountain with a punch.</p><p>At this moment, his strength was so weak that it was as if he hadn’t eaten or drunk for trillions of years. He couldn’t even push away the hand of the opposite party no matter how hard he tried!</p><p>The void attendant pretended to be angry. “Friend, no matter how good our relationship was in the past, you just saved my life. I have nothing to repay you with. If you still don’t accept my gift now, I will not be able to face you in the future.</p><p>“I…” Xu Xiaoshou’s hand went soft, and he almost drew a trouser pocket out. Why didn’t the damned void attendant have a trouser pocket on its body?</p><p>“No, you can’t say that. Although I did save your life…”</p><p>“That is the greatest kindness!”</p><p>The void attendant interrupted its old friend’s words and grabbed his hand without any explanation, smacking the pile of void crystals into its old friend’s hands.</p><p>After thinking for a while, it gritted its teeth.</p><p>“Friend, you’ve just woken up and you still have a mission to complete. You’ll definitely need these crystals more than I do.”. With another flip of its hand, another ten void crystals were piled up.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
