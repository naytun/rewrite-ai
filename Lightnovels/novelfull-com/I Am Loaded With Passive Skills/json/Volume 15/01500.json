It spread its hands in front of its body, as if it was about to transform into a true giant, and its body grew taller and taller.</p><p>“It’s indeed the void attendant, no… A void general! A void general of the Void Giant Clan!” Mei Siren revealed an expression that he had expected this.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was also looking at the scene before him solemnly. It could be said that the peak of the Giant Clan’s combat strength was not when they were suppressing their bodies, but when they were completely releasing their true body size.</p><p>“Bring… Over…”</p><p>On the long street, with another hoarse cry from void general Hong, the endless spirits turned into light spots and were absorbed into its spirit soul body.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, its height had increased to a few hundred feet, and it was still rising.</p><p>“Slam!”</p><p>Ghost Granny’s soul body which had been split into two finally couldn’t withstand the suction force and shattered into spiritual light. It was also absorbed into void general Hong’s spirit soul body and turned into nutrients.</p><p>“Whoosh…”</p><p>The spirits that filled the sky formed a visible storm, which was more than the total number of spirits that Mei Siren, Xiao Kongtong, and Xu Xiaoshou could see.</p><p>And all of these were absorbed into void general Hong’s body, without exception.</p><p>“It’s too strong!”</p><p>Mei Siren’s expression became extremely serious.</p><p>It could be said that ever since Xu Xiaoshou had successfully contracted void general Hong, the battle between him and Ghost Granny had become unequal.</p><p>This spirit soul could even pressure Mei Siren!</p><p>Mei Siren thought that with the spirit soul of the Red Ghost Inscription and the Heart Sword Technique, Xu Xiaoshou might be able to fight with an ordinary ancient swordsman who had the most basic power of a Sword Deity.</p><p>His growth was too fast!</p><p>His foundation was too solid!</p><p>The accumulation of power was like a volcanic eruption!</p><p>Not long after, when the void general Hong’s spirit soul was still devouring the spiritual light and its body expanded, it didn’t even use any extra techniques. A scream had already drifted over from the distance.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a closer look and found that it was Ghost Granny’s twisted spirit.</p><p>“Gulp!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s Adam’s apple rolled, and he didn’t know how to describe the shock in his heart.</p><p>Hong hadn’t even made a move, and it had already absorbed the spirit of all living things to recover its giant body. But Ghost Granny’s spirit couldn’t take it anymore and was directly sucked back from the distance?</p><p>With her speed, she must have run hundreds of miles just now!</p><p>This was definitely the Ghost Granny’s last life-saving trump card, but in the eyes of Hong, it was like a game!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, please let me go, I beg you!</p><p>“I have never attacked you before. You should be able to see that I have no intention of killing you. We can make a deal.”</p><p>Ghost Granny’s spirit transmitted a despairing and collapsing thought.</p><p>Received Prayer, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou put his hands behind his back, like a god who looked down on the common people, unmoved.</p><p>“You can’t do it, not that you don’t want to, right? In your mind, I’m afraid there are already thousands of ways you wish to kill me,” he thought.</p><p>Slam!</p><p>Many soul-defense weapons flew out of the void.</p><p>There was a Spiritual Banner, a Soul-swap Pearl, and the treasures that Ghost Granny had hidden in her soul space…</p><p>However, without exception, they could not even last for ten breaths in the face of void general Hong’s swallowing power and the eye of the spiritual light storm that could devour even a Demi-saint’s Power.</p><p>“Give this old woman a chance!” Ghost Granny howled in pain and madness.</p><p>She was just a higher void cultivator, and when faced with Xu Xiaoshou, who had just started cultivating the Phantom Swords Technique, she was humiliated to the point that she could not even attack.</p><p>It turned out that the first time she seized the initiative at the beginning of the battle was actually the last strike of her life.</p><p>Received desire, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was still standing there, his eyes cold.</p><p>“Put yourself in my shoes. If you are in my position, will you also give me a chance?” He once again thought about what he had said to Water Ghost, “The Struggle for the Great Path definitely be stained with blood.” He now had a deeper understanding of it.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I curse you to die a terrible death!”</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Void general Hong didn’t wait for its master’s Imperial Decree to stop, but it eventually stopped growing.</p><p>Because at this moment, Ghost Granny’s spirit was completely devoured by it, and even her last scream came to an abrupt end in pain.</p><p>Cursed, Passive Points +1.</p><p>“Burp!”</p><p>Void general Hong seemed to burp. After swallowing so many spirits, its spirit soul body glowed with more radiance.</p><p>It turned its head and stared at Xu Xiaoshou with a will-o-wisp in its eyes as if it was carrying out the conversation they had before signing the contract.</p><p>“I’ve… Grown… A little…”</p><p>“Thou… Also should….”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou silently looked in the direction where Ghost Granny had disappeared, and then his eyes fell on Hong. He finally knew why he could summon it so easily.</p><p>Hong believed his words!</p><p>Its obsession was still there. It really wanted to take the last step with him and defeat its old enemy in the most perfect way, the old enemy that it couldn’t defeat in the past!</p><p>“Don’t worry, I will.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s lips curled up as he smiled.</p><p>Without even a moment’s pause, the Red Ghost Inscription between his brows lit up and summoned Hong into the soul space to rest.</p><p>At this time, the night was no longer there, and the eternal light of Abyss Island had returned. Those who were in the middle of it seemed to have finally grown up from the darkness and welcomed their own dawn. They could no longer fear most of the fear they had before.</p><p>“Teacher, Eldest Senior Brother!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tilted his head and looked at the two people in the sky. He chuckled and said, “I’m done.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
