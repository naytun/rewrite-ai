Like Pangu who split Heaven and Earth, the clear ones rose while the turbid ones sank.</p><p>Light poured in from the distance.</p><p>This light, which bore the illusion of the giant, passed through the gap between the mountains formed by the two Way of the Sword seniors in front of him and landed on the face of Xu Xiaoshou’s self.</p><p>“Gods and Buddhas…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened his eyes in a daze and saw the two mountains in front of him.</p><p>He suddenly had an enlightenment; these were the Gods and Buddhas in his heart. They were existences that he felt he could never surpass in his current realm!</p><p>It came from Bazhun’an and Mei Siren!</p><p>However, the true intent of the Heart Sword Technique was to transcend the current understanding of the world and crush the Gods and Buddhas in one’s heart, that would then allow one to truly achieve a state of ‘lawlessness’!</p><p>Presumptuous, unruly, arrogant, and dominating the world.</p><p>“Get lost…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a sense of pride in his heart as he rose into the air.</p><p>He was not an ignorant and fearless beginner. He already had the adequate foundation.</p><p>He didn’t even need to use any other power. When the ‘will’ and ‘momentum’ in his heart perfectly matched the state of Swallow the Mountains and Rivers…</p><p>Without any hesitation, Xu Xiaoshou stood up angrily, like an ant that faced a Saint and dared to stand up and face the Gods!</p><p>Bang, bang!</p><p>The two mountains in front of him, the Present Gods and Buddhas and the Sword Image were suddenly forced back in Xu Xiaoshou’s spiritual world. They were on the verge of collapse, as if they could not bear the crushing aura of this world Lord.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou advanced one step at a time and took forceful steps as he strode forward to meet the giant’s footsteps.</p><p>“Kneel down…”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the distance, the giant took a step forward. The bright moon hung in the sky, and the day and the sun were reincarnated. Everything began to change, and the world gradually became clearer.</p><p>The two mountains in front of the tiny ant became the best stepping stones.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou responded and stepped forward, it seemed the two of them could no longer resist the Imperial Decree. They knelt on the ground and lifted Xu Xiaoshou’s spiritual body into the sky to worship him.</p><p>“This is the sort of feeling!”</p><p>“Repay all grudges and debts; I’m free and unrestrained!”</p><p>The pleasure as he looked down on the world from the spiritual world enabled Xu Xiaoshou to vent all the pressure that he had encountered along the way.</p><p>From the Acquired Stage and Innate Stage, he started to face the Sovereign Stage. From the Master Stage, the Way of the Sword and Sovereign Stage onwards, he started to face the higher void level and even the Demi-Saint realms.</p><p>When there was no way to resist in the real world and one could only be controlled by others, as long as it was an individual, one would fight for his own freedom.</p><p>Now, however, this desire for ‘freedom’ was a great help to him when he cultivated the Heart Sword Technique!</p><p>What did ‘Extreme misfortune would bring good fortune’ mean?</p><p>This was known as ‘Extreme misfortune would bring good fortune’!</p><p>He sang loudly as he moved forward. Xu Xiaoshou crossed the two mountains and at long last was about to meet the giant infused with the light.</p><p>He felt that as long as he shattered this giant in the fantasy realm, he might be able to welcome the realm of ‘No Gods and no Buddhas’ and ‘lawless’.</p><p>Yes!</p><p>Not only did Xu Xiaoshou have to crush the two mountains of the Way of the Sword, but he also had to get through something that didn’t belong to the Way of the Sword in order to form the Heart Sword Technique.</p><p>Everything had to be suppressed!</p><p>A soldier who did not want to be a general was not a good soldier.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was very ambitious. Since he wanted to cultivate the Heart Sword Technique, he had to create the strongest Present Gods and Buddhas.</p><p>It wasn’t just being the strongest in his perception, but to be the strongest beyond his perception. He wanted to make it so that any Swordsman, or even a Spiritual Cultivator would be scared out of their wits when they saw it!</p><p>However, at this moment, just as he galloped through the Spiritual World, his ‘force’ and ‘intent’ had reached the peak, and he was about to break through all the shackles and cultivate the first realm…</p><p>The Information Bar jumped. It did not belong to this world and should not have appeared in this world. However, Xu Xiaoshou had determined that as long as it appeared, no matter where he was, no matter what kind of environment he was in, he had to immediately be vigilant and put it as the first priority. He did not even hesitate to use the Holy Emperor Dragon scale to remind himself. A message had appeared.</p><p>“+(Watched, Passive Points+) +2”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, the Spiritual World became chaotic, and two ecstatic faces in the real world appeared in his ‘Perception’.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was supposed to eliminate all distracting thoughts and enter into a meditative state of cultivation and should not be affected by anything. However, when he saw the two unexpected faces, this information flashed through his mind.</p><p>“Elder Xie? Ghost Granny?”</p><p>“These are the assassins from the Central region. They’re watching from the side. Were they out to kill me?”</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>Just as this thought flashed through his mind, the invasion of devilish energy erupted from his spiritual body. It was a sign of distraction and cultivation deviation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
