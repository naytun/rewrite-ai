She would be able to survive if she sharpened Xu Xiaoshou’s blade today. If Elder Xie was still alive and learned of this, he would die of anger instantly.</p><p>After all, with the Cursed Yin Eye attached to his body, as long as no one stopped him, there was a 90% chance that he had died.</p><p>“Do as you please. Just do your best. Go all out to kill, as long as you win, no one will keep you here today.” Mei Siren said with a smile.</p><p>“If I dared to kill, I would not survive today.” Ghost Granny was already overjoyed. She knew what to do. Xu Xiaoshou could not die today. She could only win, and it would be a tough battle. She couldn’t injure or maim Xu Xiaoshou, let alone kill him.</p><p>One must be merciful!</p><p>“How do I fight?” Xu Xiaoshou also looked at Master Siren.</p><p>He was not lying just now. With Ghost Granny’s current unstable state of mind, one flash of his Heart Sword Technique of Present Gods and Buddhas was enough to strip this old woman of her cultural deviation.</p><p>When Ghost Granny was at her peak, she might have been able to resist it with a special method, but now Ghost Granny had been scared out of her wits! She didn’t even have the strength to resist.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou knew that what Master Siren wanted him to use was not the Heart Sword Technique, but the Phantom Swords Technique!</p><p>However, for the Phantom Swords Technique…</p><p>Right now, Xu Xiaoshou’s understanding of this sword technique was only limited to its name. To be more precise, other than the large amount of internal knowledge brought about by the Sword Technique Expertise, it would be difficult for him to execute it in a short time.</p><p>This was the same as before when he trained for the Heart Sword Technique.</p><p>“Since your realization quality of the Heart Sword Technique is so good, I’ll teach you while you learn and fight. But remember, you can only use the Phantom Swords Technique this time.”</p><p>Mei Siren’s answer was just as Xu Xiaoshou had expected, and he even looked at Ghost Granny.</p><p>“I’ll say the same thing. You do your best, but if Xu Xiaoshou used any other abilities besides the Phantom Swords Technique, you win. You can leave at any time.”</p><p>What?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned when he heard this.</p><p>“Teacher, don’t you have too much faith in me? Where did that come from? I am not even that confident!”</p><p>Ghost Granny was also confused.</p><p>She shook her head twice before she realized what the old Sword Deity meant. She said in disbelief, “You mean he has to restrain himself during our fight?” She pointed at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Mei Siren waved his paper fan. “Are you stupid?” These few choice words and a question mark were directed at the other party.</p><p>He didn’t repeat what he said, but smiled and said, “You’ve already made an allowance for his physical body, so he should restrain himself as a reciprocal, right?”</p><p>Ghost Granny truly appreciated the upright attitude of the Ancient Swordsman. She simply loved the phrase ‘reciprocity’.</p><p>“Are you a beginner?” Ghost Granny finally looked at Xu Xiaoshou; what she referred to was to was the Phantom Swords Technique.</p><p>From what Mei Siren said, it was not difficult to tell that Xu Xiaoshou was still inexperienced and had never been exposed to the Phantom Swords Technique before!</p><p>“Yes…”</p><p>Xu Xaoshou nodded and Ghost Granny felt that she had been struck by a stroke of luck from the Heavens. Her heart even bloomed like a flower, and she almost jumped in joy.</p><p>There’s a chance, there’s definitely a chance!</p><p>Today, she definitely had a chance to survive!</p><p>The Heavens are not ready for me yet!</p><p>Let alone a battle, even if you were given a year or ten years, would Xu Xiaoshou have already reached the first realm of the Ancient Swordsman Phantom Swords Technique?</p><p>Ghost Granny only had a superficial understanding of the Ancient Swordsman.</p><p>Only when the cultivation level of the Cutting Path Stage combined with the first realm of the Nine Major Sword Techniques could one hurt the higher void level.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was only at the Master Stage cultivation level, and he was not allowed to use any external force now. He could only use the Phantom Swords Technique. Even if he reached the first realm, would he be able to kill her?</p><p>What kind of joke was this!</p><p>“I’m looking forward to your Phantom Swords Techniques.” Ghost Granny couldn’t suppress the smile on her face, and a hint of ridicule appeared in her eyes.</p><p>“Received contempt. Passive value,+1.”</p><p>As the Information Bar jumped, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyelids twitched as well.</p><p>It had to be said that the other party’s contemptuous look was very annoying. Xu Xiaoshou could clearly feel the pressure that Master Siren had deliberately subjected him to.</p><p>He believed that if he couldn’t kill Ghost Granny today, his Teacher and the others would really let her go. This was what their ‘character’ was like.</p><p>However, since the opportunity for the five-member team of assassins from the Central Region to gather together tonight had come, he would not let this malignant tumor in front of him go.</p><p>In the end, Ghost Granny was an assassin and a higher void level. As long as he spared her tonight, she might really take his life at any moment.</p><p>He was not afraid of thieves, but he was afraid of the thieves’ intentions!</p><p>“I’m also looking forward to this…”</p><p>Xu XIaoshou closed his eyes and took a step forward, with his chest thrust out slightly. On the contrary, the pressure had stimulated his arrogance, and he had more confidence in the Phantom Swords Technique that he was about to execute.</p><p>“It’s just the beginning, but very soon, it will be the peak.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
