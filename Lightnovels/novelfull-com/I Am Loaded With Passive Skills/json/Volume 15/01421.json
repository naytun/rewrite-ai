However, he was unable to clearly see the scene in front of him.</p><p>“Pitter-patter, pitter-patter…”</p><p>The rain became heavier, from droplets to a downpour.</p><p>As though the storm had touched his soul, Yu Lingdi finally felt that his body had returned upon feeling the clear coolness against his skin.</p><p>“W-where is this?”</p><p>He struggled to get up, and images flashed through his mind.</p><p>After being nailed to the Saint Punishment Pillar, he met Gu Qingyi by chance. Then, his body experienced countless intense pain, before the gate to Abyss Island world was opened.</p><p>Everyone entered Abyss Island through his body.</p><p>He, who had gone through such tremendous suffering, was so weak that he fainted on the Saint Punishment Pillar, unable to do anything about these changes.</p><p>“I am not…fully recovered yet.”</p><p>Spreading out his hands, Yu Lingdi carefully examined them. His hands were very small and very tender, like the hands of a child. Furthermore, there was a strong sense of surrealism.</p><p>His consciousness did not seem to have returned to the real world. It appeared that at this time, he was only sucked into this illusory space by an unknown force.</p><p>“Someone’s coming!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi realized that an external force had entered the Saint Execution Ground, but it didn’t attack. It shouldn’t be an enemy.</p><p>He tried hard to identify this illusory world, but other than the heavy rain and the vast white fog in the distance, there were no other abnormalities in the vast ocean below him.</p><p>He struggled to get up on the water, wanting to walk.</p><p>With a thud, Yu Lingdi fell.</p><p>He lowered his head and saw a distorted image reflected in the rippling water mirror under his feet. There was only a child who seemed to be at the age where he was just learning how to speak.</p><p>“I’ve become smaller…”</p><p>All of this was like a dream. Yu Lingdi was in a daze, unable to lift his eyes to look forward.</p><p>The white fog in the distance suddenly churned, and a human figure was vaguely outlined.</p><p>The person’s body was covered in water vapor, and his shape changed in the mist around him. It was as if the world was born for him, and everything was running according to his will.</p><p>The person was back facing him and walking into the distance alone, desolate and lonely.</p><p>“Who’s there!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi shouted, wanting to walk forward, but with a plop, he fell back into the water.</p><p>“Water…”</p><p>He was the master of Water-type Upanishad, but he couldn’t use any of his power in this world of water. This was simply impossible!</p><p>Yu Lingdi gathered all his power, as much as he could, and tried to use the Water-type Upanishad Formation to take control of this world.</p><p>However, no matter how hard he tried, it was all in vain.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>At this moment, the ethereal figure in the distance seemed to be surprised. He half-tilted his head and looked at Yu Lingdi.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s eyes widened with all their might, but he was still unable to see the true face of that figure under the cover of the mist.</p><p>“I didn’t expect you to wake up so quickly. This is beyond my expectations! I originally thought that you wouldn’t be able to see me this time.”</p><p>A light laugh came from all directions, and Yu Lingdi trembled as if he had just been struck by lightning.</p><p>This voice…</p><p>This voice! How was that possible?</p><p>At this moment, a mirage brought him back to his childhood.</p><p>The man who had been known as the strongest spiritual cultivator at the time was not only strict with the outside world, but he had also trained himself in a way that was close to extreme.</p><p>Countless times, he almost drowned to death in the water, and countless times, he was pulled back when he was on the verge of death.</p><p>This memory was simply too old, so old that Yu Lingdi had almost forgotten about it. The world in front of him was the nightmare that he hated the most when he was young.</p><p>However, he never held any hatred.</p><p>He knew the burden on his shoulders. He knew how much hope that man had placed on him. He knew that his line of descendants had to accept the glory and honor of the family!</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s only dream was to walk this man’s path and then surpass him… In an even shorter time, surpass him!</p><p>However, at a certain point in time, bad news came from the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>He was dead.</p><p>He died in the line of duty during a regular operation.</p><p>The last wish he left behind was for Yu Lingdi to take over his position and shoulder the responsibility.</p><p>Even though he was so strong!</p><p>He died.</p><p>Thus, Yu Lingdi cultivated with all his might, just to inherit this glory, and then take revenge after he grew up!</p><p>In the White cave, he met his enemy, but this was the first time he felt powerless. He didn’t even dare to show his face and only had a superficial experience.</p><p>He had met his enemy again on Abyss Island. This time, he did not retreat and chose to fight head-on. Even if he had to die, he wanted to know how big the gap between him and his enemy was.</p><p>Then, he was hung on the Saint Punishment Pillar.</p><p>Despair and pain could not obliterate a person’s will. Yu Lingdi firmly believed that as long as the person did not die, the gap brought about by time would eventually be closed with time.</p><p>He would definitely be able to defeat Bazhun’an at some point in the future!</p><p>Now, however, at the time when he was at his weakest…</p><p>This voice had appeared!</p><p>“He can’t possibly appear!”</p><p>“He’s already dead!”</p><p>“I’m dreaming? Is this an illusion?”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets. This was the first time he doubted the authenticity of this underwater world.</p><p>However, he thought about it again. Other than that person, who else in the world could suppress him in a world that was completely filled with water?</p><p>Even if it was a dream!</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Yu Lingdi raised his eyes and howled, not daring to believe that that person had returned.</p><p>“I think you already have the answer, don’t you?”</p><p>In the distance, the mist was dense and condensed into a water ball that could trap people, trapping both of them, Yu Lingdi and the figure, inside.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
