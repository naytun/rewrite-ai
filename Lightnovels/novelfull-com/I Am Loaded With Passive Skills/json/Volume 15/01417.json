I’ll Wash, Wash, Wash (3)</p><p>“Jiang Buyi should be the target of your revenge. Grow! Breakthrough to the demi-saint realm and destroy him!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou roared in his heart like a madman, but he did not say it out loud. Some words could not be said, and if he pointed out the story too precisely, he would be risking his plan.</p><p>He sobbed and patted the void attendant’s shoulder, trying to comfort it.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The void attendant finally couldn’t take it anymore. It put its hands on its waist and roared, its roar shaking the sky and earth, causing the three humans behind it to tremble in fear.</p><p>“What the hell is Xu Xiaoshou doing?”</p><p>“What did he do to the void attendant? Why did it lose control of its emotions with just a few words?”</p><p>The hearts of the three people, including Mei Siren, turned cold.</p><p>They had long known that Xu Xiaoshou did not have good intentions, but they could not understand the void attendant language used by the two giants.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>The crazily roaring void attendant suddenly spoke in the human language, “Humans! Detestable! Roar!”.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment. He also turned his head and roared like a madman, “Humans! Dogshit! Roar!”.</p><p>The three humans were speechless.</p><p>Did Xu Xiaoshou go crazy?</p><p>How could he forget his ancestors?</p><p>Did he forget that he was also a human?</p><p>The void attendant was filled with hatred. It wanted to rush over and tear the three humans apart. However, when it thought of the old man in the trio, who had the capability to kill a saint…</p><p>It endured it.</p><p>The void attendant held its companion’s shoulder and cried helplessly. If the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer was emptied by the demi-saint, how could it get all the spiritual medicine back in the future?</p><p>“My condolences. Perhaps you’ll have the chance in the future.” Xu Xiaoshou hugged it, patted its back, and kissed the void attendant’s forehead.</p><p>The void attendant was still crying.</p><p>It was so aggrieved!</p><p>After being used by humans, tricked, and beaten up, it had held on to its emotions for too long. Upon escaping from death, it could not help but let go of its emotions and cry bitterly in front of its savior.</p><p>At this moment, the void attendant finally knew the truth.</p><p>No wonder Jiang Buyi, the demi-saint, had come to his rescue when it was fighting Teng Shanhai. They were indeed on the same side.</p><p>It was no wonder that Jiang Buyi, the demi-saint, did not give his all when he was saving Teng Shanhai. He was as weak as a rookie. It turned out that he had suppressed his cultivation and wanted Teng Shanhai to die in its hands!</p><p>It was no wonder that after he failed to kill Teng Shanhai, Jiang Buyi, the demi-Saint, killed Teng Shanhai. He had already taken all the spiritual medicines from his accomplice. Now, he wanted to take the share from Teng Shanhai.</p><p>No wonder there was a huge difference in the demi-saint’s strength in the initial stage and the after. It turned out that everything was just an act.</p><p>The void attendant cried.</p><p>It turned out that it had been kept in the dark all along. A dignified giant had been played by the humans!</p><p>If it didn’t have such a good companion, it might even be abandoned after being used, and it wouldn’t even know who to find for revenge.</p><p>All of a sudden, the void attendant realized that something was wrong.</p><p>Yes!</p><p>The demi-saint Jiang Buyi’s strength had changed greatly. It could be understood that he was suppressing his cultivation.</p><p>However…</p><p>Jiang Buyi, who was weak in the early stage, had the scent of spiritual medicine from the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer. He became stronger in the later stages, but his aura had disappeared.</p><p>“This, what’s going on?” The void attendant asked its best friend as it leaned on his chest.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t flustered at all. He was only surprised.</p><p>Amazing! To think that it could think of this, it did have some wisdom!</p><p>However, it’s not important anymore.</p><p>He had given this giant a complete and perfect story. These so-called details couldn’t even be called flaws. If he, Xu Xiaoshou, could be questioned by it, did he deserve to be called a Xu?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou heaved a long sigh and rubbed the void attendant’s round head with his big hand. He said sadly,</p><p>“My good brother, you’re foolish. He suppressed his cultivation at the beginning, so of course, he didn’t have extra power to cover his smell. However, once he recovered his full strength as a demi-saint, what kind of smell can’t he get rid of?”</p><p>“You can’t beat a demi-saint, but you’re still wondering what method the other party used to erase his scent. Does that matter?”</p><p>“That’s not important!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was exasperated.</p><p>The void attendant was stunned for a long time before it burst into tears again.</p><p>That’s true!</p><p>These words were dripping with blood and tore open the biggest scar in its heart.</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>It couldn’t even beat a demi-saint, so why bother with these things?</p><p>Would knowing how he erased his scent help it defeat a demi-saint?</p><p>It should be thinking about how to use the power of Abyss Island to wipe out the evil, treacherous, and sinful demi-saint Jiang Buyi in the Nine Forbidden Grounds or banish him to the Inner Island of Abyss Island!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
