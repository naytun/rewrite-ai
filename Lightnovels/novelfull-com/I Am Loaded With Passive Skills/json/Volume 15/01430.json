After he reached the same height as the two people beside him, he turned back to look in the direction of the Forest of Miracles and finally felt utterly relaxed.</p><p>The nightmare had ended.</p><p>They were all alive and had safely left the cursed Forest of Miracles, far away from the Demi-Saint.</p><p>“Tell me!”</p><p>Mei Siren and Xiao Kongtong landed on the ground as well. They stared at the black giant in front of them as it slowly shrank and finally turned into Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Not only were they curious when Xu Xiaoshou and the Void Attendant bade each other a fond farewell, but they were also curious about how the fight in the Forest of Miracles started. They were even more curious about how Xu Xiaoshou managed to provoke the Demi-Saint.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had reverted to his true appearance, glanced discreetly at Master Siren whom he found to be something of a novelty and explained, “It’s just a very ordinary battle, right? The process was a little complicated, but fortunately, the final result was good.”</p><p>He paused for a moment and finally looked back at Master Siren, “This is my original appearance.”</p><p>“You look much better than before,” Mei Siren smiled and nodded.</p><p>In his memory, Xu Xiaoshou still looked like Young Master Xu from the First Pavilion in the Sky…</p><p>Although he had seen various versions of the ‘true body’ of Xu Xiaoshou, he had always been with Xu Fuji, so he found Xu Xiaoshou’s actual appearance a little strange.</p><p>“So ordinary?”</p><p>When he heard this, Ye Xiaotian, who stood beside him, snorted in displeasure and said with an irate expression, “Xu Xiaoshou, you’re all grown up now, aren’t you? Your Master is even afraid to face this Demi-Saint and you call this ordinary?”</p><p>“Uh, hehe.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was at a loss for words. He turned to look at the angry white-haired Taoist youth and his eyes lit up. “Greetings, Master Dean! I have not congratulated Master Dean on his attainment of the final-stage of the Spatial Upanishad. In this world, I’m afraid that the number of people who can reach this stage can be counted on one hand. Master Dean is a Deva, a heavenly talent, a role model for our generation!”</p><p>“Don’t flatter me!” Ye Xiaotian snorted coldly as he thought to himself, “Weren’t you arrogant and smug when you were the Void Attendant? How dare you make fun of us? Now that you’ve become smaller, why did you become so timid?”</p><p>“Hurry up and tell us, how you pulled all these off!”</p><p>As soon as he said this, Mei Siren and Xiao Kongtong also looked over. It was obvious that they too were very curious about the ins and outs of the battle in the Forest of Miracles.</p><p>After all, they had been drawn into the Demi-Saint’s vortex. If they didn’t understand the situation clearly and if the karma cycle should turn around, the three of them would probably be inexplicably injured or even die in a confused state.</p><p>When he saw the three pairs of eyes trained on him, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to play dumb. He laughed and said:</p><p>“It’s actually quite simple, so let me briefly summarize it. This is what happened…”</p><p>“I plucked a few Spiritual Herbs from the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer and provoked the Void Attendant. I thought this big guy might be able to defeat a Demi-Saint, so I pretended to be the one from the Jiang clan and fought with the Void Attendant.”</p><p>“Unfortunately, Teng Shanhai appeared out of nowhere and used the Xiao Divine Spear to see through my disguise. Thus, I could only play along and trap him in the game. I let the Void Attendant mistakenly think that he and Demi-Saint Jiang were the ones who stole the Spiritual Herbs.”</p><p>“After that, I went into hiding and watched the three of them fight. Later on, Rao Yaoyao came out to save Teng Shanhai. However, because of Demi-Saint Jiang, she failed. In the end, the three of you appeared and you all knew what happened thereafter.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou carefully considered his words. As he spoke, he observed the expressions of the three people in front of him.</p><p>Their faces were totally devoid of any expression!</p><p>The three old foxes listened in silence for a long time, as if they had been petrified.</p><p>The scene was calm, in fact it was a little too calm. Only Xu Xiaoshou knew that it was only calm on the surface, because the information bar spammed frantically away.</p><p>“Doubted. Passive value,+3.”</p><p>“Condemned. Passive value,+3.”</p><p>“Cursed. Passive,+3.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s lips twitched. When he saw that the two people beside him were silent, he had no choice but to speak first and challenged him about the apparent imprecision of what he had just told them.</p><p>“How many Spiritual Herbs did you pull out from the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer?” He vaguely remembered the scene he had seen from the Spatial Mirror. The land guarded by the Void Attendant had become a deep pit.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his hands, and his eyes looked up into the sky as he said,” A few large plants!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian took a deep breath. He was already aware that the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer had indeed been emptied by Xu Xiaoshou. It was just like how Xu Xiaoshou had almost destroyed the Small World after he entered the Tianxuan Gate.</p><p>There were so many Spiritual Herbs. How could he simply have pulled out ‘a few large plants’? This ‘large’ must refer to the entire Herb Garden of Divine Farmer!</p><p>However, the two people beside him looked friendly, and there was no sign of any hostility. Ye Xiaotian did not ask any further, as he believed that he was the only Elder who had the closest relationship with Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>That’s right, no matter what, Ye Xiaotian was confident that he could maintain his composure and would not lay a finger on his own juniors.</p><p>But he couldn’t guarantee that if others knew that Xu Xiaoshou had uprooted the entire Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, they wouldn’t kill him and seize his treasure, even if the two people next to him appeared to have a close relationship with Xu Xiaoshou and seemed to be very kind.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
