There are many opportunities, but the danger is also terrifying.”</p><p>“My suggestion is that since we are all ‘fellow Dao members’ who have gone through life and death, why don’t we travel together? A least we can look out for each other.”</p><p>Ghost Granny had no problem with this and nodded immediately.</p><p>Although Reverend Huang Yang said that he wanted to repay their kindness, he did not dare to travel with these two assassins. How could he not see that these two assassins coveted his treasure?</p><p>In addition to the inexplicable ‘death countdown’ that appeared in his mind, Reverend Huang Yang currently only had one goal in mind – the First Hall of Sins!</p><p>When they were trapped in the Blood Sea, they had exchanged information about the Sky City.</p><p>He had learned about the Death Exemption Token and the First Hall of Sins from a higher void level who had already died. Perhaps this could remove the strange countdown in his mind.</p><p>When he thought of this, Reverend Huang Yang was about to refuse, but suddenly, the sound of a gust of wind swept across the Nine Heavens.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>The three of them shuddered and ducked. They split into two sides and hid in the dark corners of the dilapidated ancient city, their hearts palpitating.</p><p>This fluctuation was dense.</p><p>Without even looking, the three of them knew that the aura was many times stronger than their own!</p><p>However, these three higher void level devilish beings couldn’t hold back their curiosity and released their spiritual senses that swept across the sky at the same time.</p><p>It was a small giant that was three meters tall. It was dressed in simple linen clothes and was an enlarged version of a human being.</p><p>Over in its left hand was an Elder who was the size of a normal human. He was dressed in a luxurious gold robe, his hair was light gold and he had an imposing appearance.</p><p>At a glance…</p><p>“Bang! Bang! Bang!”</p><p>In the dark part of the ancient city, the three of them fell to their knees. Blood seeped out from their seven orifices, and their bodies cracked. Three large pits formed on the ground.</p><p>“Demi-Saint!”</p><p>“Two Demi-Saints!”</p><p>The faces of the three reckless higher void levels turned green. Cold sweat and blood oozed out of their bodies as they roared and repented in their hearts.</p><p>The Sky City really had a Demi-Saint!</p><p>And there were two of them!</p><p>“D*mn it, am I looking for death? How could I dare to use my spiritual senses to scan for people of unknown origin in such a terrifying place?”</p><p>“It’s over, I met a Saint and I just got the treasure…”</p><p>It’s all over!</p><p>…</p><p>“Yan Wuse, the three people at your feet. The higher void level… the Three Incenses’ assassins, Elder Xie, Ghost Granny and Reverend Huang Yang from the Xuanmen United Path… their auras are weak. They must have come from a great battle. Number Two’s emotionless voice could be heard as he flew while he carried the person.</p><p>“Don’t worry about them, they’re just ignorant fools.” Yan Wuse’s face was filled with frustration. “The most important thing right now is to complete our mission.”</p><p>Yan Wuse’s expression was not very pleasant as he clutched his light golden hair.</p><p>Their mission was to strengthen the seal on the Inner Island of the Abyss Island.</p><p>However, the spatial passageway in the fallen abyss was in a total mess. Let alone strengthening the seal, they couldn’t even locate the seal.</p><p>The fallen abyss, one of the nine extreme grounds, was the only safe place that could connect to the Inner island of the Abyss Island. It was founded by the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>“Someone has messed up the seal of the Abyss Island. Can you tell what the situation is like? It’s just like the tricks of the scammer Dao Qiongcang from the martial arts world.” Yan Wuse looked straight ahead, and his Saint’s will swept through the Giants’ kingdom in an unbridled manner, on the lookout for any suspicious looking people. He even tried to reduce his workload by asking Number Two.</p><p>“It’s either those guys from the Inner island are up to something, or someone from the Outer Island has activated the sealing formation.” Number two replied calmly.</p><p>“It’s impossible on the Inner island. They can’t get out and can’t meddle with the seal. The chances are too low.” Yan Wuse shook his head.</p><p>“You’re right.” Number Two nodded.</p><p>When he heard this, Yan Wuse’s eyebrows twitched and he looked up in anger. “I’m asking you to give me a solution!”</p><p>“This is your job.” Number Two said calmly. Suddenly, he felt that the aura of the person in his hands was a little off. He changed the topic and immediately said :</p><p>“I have three plans.”</p><p>“First, the probability of the Abyss Island’s will weakening is very small. It’s basically impossible for it to be born, respond to anyone, and its will would not be distorted.”</p><p>“Two, go to the other eight extreme grounds. As long as the ‘core’ is still there, there should be nothing wrong with the seal.”</p><p>“Three, the Void Suppression Stele. I have to find all 365 Void Suppression Steles, one by one. As long as their corresponding array positions are the same, the seal will be fine.”</p><p>Yan Wuse was overjoyed.</p><p>Number Two had given him three solutions, when it fact there was only one.</p><p>First of all, it was as if the Spirit of the Abyss Island did not exist, so there was no need to consider it at all.</p><p>Secondly, who would be so bored as to move the Void Suppression Stele? Other than suppressing the Inner island’s seal, this thing had no other use. It was not something that ordinary people could move!</p><p>The Spirit Cultivation and the Way of the Sword were both invalid, and could be used simply by leaving a name on it.</p><p>It couldn’t be that a guy who liked to exercise came to the Abyss Island and carried that broken stone to build up his muscles or did some squats, right?</p><p>There were so many treasures of Heaven and Earth, and instead of snatching or digging for those, he was moving stones? Anyone with a brain would not do such a stupid thing!</p><p>“Which extreme grounds is closest to this place?” Yan Wuse asked, as he considered the second option.</p><p>Number Two also felt that the probability of the second option was higher, so he said without thinking, “There are three. From the nearest to the farthest, they are the Blood World, the Absolute Ember Fire Domain, and the Forest of Miracles. Which one should we go to first?”</p><p>“Blood World.” Yan Wuse made his choice without hesitation.</p><p>The Absolute Ember Fire Domain was so hot that even he couldn’t stand it. No one could get close to the core, the heart of illumination, not even the Infernal lineage from the Holy Palace.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
