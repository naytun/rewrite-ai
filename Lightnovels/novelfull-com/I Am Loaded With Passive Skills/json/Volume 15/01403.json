To think the demi-saint Jiang Buyi chose to admit defeat?</p><p>So this was the pressure the name “Bazhun’an” brought him?</p><p>“Wow…”</p><p>He had already prepared himself mentally for a desperate fight. The plan of “laughing for ten breaths” and “risking his life to save that person” had already become a reality for him. The appearance of Mei Siren could only be considered an unexpected joy.</p><p>He didn’t expect the battle situation to turn around like this.</p><p>The great pressure that Xiao Kongtong gave did not stimulate Jiang Buyi to attack. Instead, it forced the latter to retreat.</p><p>This was naturally the best ending!</p><p>What was a perfect plan?</p><p>The most perfect plan was that none of the previous preparations were needed. Everyone would just come out and show their faces, then go back to their own homes.</p><p>However, Ye Xiaotian was wondering if such a perfect ending really existed in this world.</p><p>If he was Jiang Buyi, after coveting Xu Xiaoshou to no avail and having one of his demi-saint incarnations destroyed, how could he let the matter rest so easily just because of a few words from someone?</p><p>At the very least, he had to leave a few threats or take someone away, right?</p><p>At present, Mei Siren couldn’t possibly be taken away, and “Bazhun’an” whom Xiao Kongtong had transformed into was out of the question as well. If his speculation was true, only two possibilities were left for the people who would be taken away… Himself or Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“Be careful,” Ye Xiaotian reminded Xiao Kongtong from behind, not letting his guard down at all.</p><p>He understood the principle of falling short at the last moment. The closer the matter was to the last moment, the easier it was for people to relax. At that time, it was also easier for accidents to happen.</p><p>On top of the Demon God’s great spear, just like Ye Xiaotian, Xiao Kongtong did not let his guard down at all.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s cowardice was both reasonable and unexpected. He was most worried that this guy would take something before he left.</p><p>If a demi-saint wanted to leave, even if everyone here worked together, they would not be able to stop him.</p><p>However, this guy’s last attempt might let the other party learn that he wasn’t the true “Bazhun’an”!</p><p>That being said, even though he was thinking as such, it was impossible for Xiao Kongtong to keep the other party here. He could only follow Jiang Buyi’s words and said calmly, “Thank you, Demi-Saint Jiang, for your respect… Don’t worry, I will remember this favor. If I have the chance to pass by the Jiang clan in Pu Xuan of the Northern Region in the future, I will go and find Demi-Saint Jiang for tea and a chat. After all, there’s still a long way to go. Today’s enemy may be tomorrow’s friend. Perhaps we will have the opportunity to work together in the future.”</p><p>“Right?” Xiao Kongtong laughed.</p><p>Jiang Buyi did not show any smiles.</p><p>How could he not hear that this fellow was threatening him?</p><p>A summary of the unspoken threat was such: “If you dare to touch the Saint Slave’s people today, I’ll dare to make a big scene in the Jiang Clan of the Northern Region in the future. You can leave if you want, but do so obediently and everyone will live in peace. If you want to take advantage of your demi-saint abilities to attack others before you leave… You can run away, but your family can’t!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s eyes narrowed slightly. He did have such an intention.</p><p>Or rather, the thought wasn’t just from a moment ago. After realizing that he wouldn’t be able to get a result from fighting Mei Siren, he wanted to take Xu Xiaoshou and leave.</p><p>However, at that crucial moment, Bazhun’an appeared.</p><p>This guy’s ability to make use of every opportunity was too strong. Bazhun’an had completely grasped his psychological state and knew when to say offensive words and when to persuade.</p><p>But…</p><p>No! there can’t be a “but”!</p><p>Did he not hear Bazhun’an’s threat?</p><p>If he forcefully made a move on Xu Xiaoshou today, he could only hide in the main sect of the Jiang Clan in Pu Xuan in the Northern Region in the future and wait for the great crisis that would come in God knows when. He would have to live in fear under such circumstances.</p><p>He wasn’t afraid of being attacked, but he had to be fearful of an attack that was deliberate and prepared!</p><p>Jiang Buyi was silent for a long time. Under the extremely vigilant gazes of the other three at the scene, he finally sighed, “Bazhun’an, I said I would give you face, so I will. It’s hard to say what will happen in the future, but I don’t want to have too much to do with you. It’s good for everyone if we stay out of each other’s way.”</p><p>After a pause, Jiang Buyi did not want to dwell on this topic. He turned his gaze to the person behind Bazhun’an, the one who had brought along a Spatial Power Upanishad Formation with him since entering.</p><p>If he was not mistaken, the formation below the white-haired boy’s feet was a long-cherished goal for all Spiritual Cultivators on the continent!</p><p>“Spatial Upanishad?” Jiang Buyi chuckled, “I don’t think I’ve seen you before. When did such a person appear on the continent? Are you also a Saint Servant? What’s your name?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian felt like cursing when he saw everyone’s gaze on him.</p><p>Why?</p><p>There were so many people here, why would they pay attention to an insignificant guy like him?</p><p>Ye Xiaotian took a deep breath and cupped his hands, “I’m Zhou Shen.”</p><p>“Zhou Shen?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was stunned, and so was Mei Siren.</p><p>Why did his words have Xu Xiaoshou’s style?</p><p>Jiang Buyi was also stunned for a moment. Then, he laughed, “So your surname is Zhou? I thought your surname was Ye and your name was Ye Xiaotian.”</p><p>Fuck!</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s scalp tingled.</p><p>So he knew him? Then why was he asking for his name? Was he crazy?</p><p>Jiang Buyi did not say anything more. He only took a deep look at Ye Zhoushen, then retracted his gaze.</p><p>Spatial Upanishad…</p><p>The boy’s combat strength seemed insignificant today, but as long as he didn’t die, he would definitely have a place at the top of the continent in the future.</p><p>He was much stronger than “Huang Quan”, who had the space-time attribute, as well as “Kong Yuhen”, who had only appeared once in the world and disappeared after taking a spot in the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>At the very least, Ye Zhoushen specialized in the Spatial Path and was also a living person who knew how to lie. He was not like the other two, who were like filthy rats that only gave partial truths!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
