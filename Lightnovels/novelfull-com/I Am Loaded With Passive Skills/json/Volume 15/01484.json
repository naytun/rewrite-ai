As long as she dared to control so many spirits at the same time, Ghost Granny was certain that her mental strength would be drained in an instant. Even her soul power would be exhausted. She would have to take pills to save her life.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even take any medicine.</p><p>“Is he a monster?</p><p>“He must have devoured a large number of higher void souls, or he must have cultivated a soul-strengthening technique for many years. Otherwise, he would not be able to withstand such a consumption.”</p><p>Ghost Granny’s eyes flickered, and she even thought of taking over Xu Xiaoshou’s body.</p><p>He would make a perfect embryo! He was impeccable in all aspects!</p><p>Wasn’t she lacking such a body now?</p><p>What a pity, she dared to dream, but she dared not act upon it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou happily looked at the series of Passive Points pop-up notifications that the light slap brought to him. He only hated that there weren’t many people here who had seen his glorious moment and couldn’t boost his points more.</p><p>This might be difficult for others, but it was simple for him.</p><p>Weaving Expertise was at the Sovereign Stage, and Xu Xiaoshou had long entered the transcendent state with his cross-functional control technique.</p><p>As for the consumption, it was a joke. The consumption of ‘transformation’, Eternal Vitality, and High Spirits was not even one percent of the consumption of Present Gods and Buddhas. It was just a game.</p><p>“Teacher, what’s the third step?” Xu Xiaoshou looked at Master Siren.</p><p>Teacher!</p><p>This sentence pulled Ghost Granny, who was still in shock, back to reality.</p><p>“So, the Seven Sword Deity Mei Siren is really Xu Xiaoshou’s Teacher! He has admitted it himself. This can’t be fake. When did this happen? No wonder even Xiao Kongtong protected him.” Ghost Granny’s mind was filled with thoughts, and she finally sank to the bottom of the valley, not daring to think further.</p><p>Now, she only hoped that Mei Siren would stop teaching, and that Xu Xiaoshou would stop learning.</p><p>If he continued learning and had fun, she would lose her life!</p><p>“The third step… Mei Siren let out a heavy sigh of relief. “The so-called third step, you have already displayed it just now. You have already learned it.”</p><p>“Ah?” Xu Xiaoshou was puzzled.</p><p>A light slap?</p><p>Just this?</p><p>Mei Siren took a few steps forward and casually destroyed the rare “spirit” that he had summoned.</p><p>He wasn’t good at the Phantom Swords Technique, so he couldn’t find so many spirits that Xu Xiaoshou had found here. He sighed and said,</p><p>“The three introductory parts of the Phantom Swords Technique are Summoning Spirits, Ghost Inscription, and Enslaving.</p><p>“Being able to do these three steps means that you have the qualifications to cultivate the Phantom Swords Technique. Hmm, for ordinary people, this is actually very, very difficult. It might take years or even decades to find the feeling.</p><p>“And in order to improve on this path and cultivate the first stage, Spirits Controlling, you need to repeatedly try and sum up your experience. Like sharpening a sword, step by step, you need to use the power of the soul that is fed back by the continuous use of the Phantom Swords Technique to hone the strength of your soul.”</p><p>His voice became weaker and weaker and finally stopped.</p><p>Mei Siren sighed in his heart, “But with the strength of your soul, it seems that you don’t need to train anymore.”</p><p>Thus, he decisively ended all the subsequent basic teaching and directly went to the intensity level.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, remember this!</p><p>“You can use the ordinary Ghost Inscription as you wish. After all, they can be recycled at any time. However, there’s another powerful Red Ghost Inscription that belongs exclusively to the ghost swordsmen.</p><p>As he spoke, his eyes narrowed, and the dark sword light in his eyes dissipated, condensing into a small illusory Blood Sword between his eyebrows.</p><p>“This is the Red Ghost Inscription!</p><p>“It can allow you to use a contract method to enslave a powerful spirit soul that you like for a long time and make it serve you for life.</p><p>“However, the method to condense the Red Ghost Inscription is too difficult. It requires a piece of your soul and flesh, using the soul’s blood essence as the main ingredient, mixed with many auxiliary means, and added with the three kinds of monastic aura, which are the Sword Will, Imperial Decree, and power of contract.”</p><p>Before he could finish his words, Mei Siren was stunned again.</p><p>He saw that the small dark sword in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes had also disappeared. Then, a dark red sword condensed between his eyebrows and turned into a small blood-red sword.</p><p>Mei Siren was confused.</p><p>Immediately, Mei Siren, Xiao Kongtong, and Ghost Granny lost their ability to speak and were in a mess in the night wind.</p><p>Ghost Granny was already numb. She was completely dumbfounded.</p><p>What happened to the extremely difficult supplementary methods?</p><p>Your teacher, Mei Siren, hasn’t even explained the specific method clearly. Xu Xiaoshou, what’s wrong with you? How did you succeed? Ah!</p><p>Are you crazy?</p><p>Don’t teach and learn anymore!</p><p>Just say it, I beg you. You’re putting on a show, right?</p><p>I’m sure you’ve already taught him and he has learned it, right?</p><p>Xiao Kongtong flew forward and stuck his face close to Xu Xiaoshou to carefully examine the blood-red sword between his brows. He then looked at Master Siren in shock and swallowed his saliva as he nodded silently at the old Sword Deity.</p><p>At this moment, he also thought that Master Siren had made a mistake when he was teaching Xu Xiaoshou the Heart Sword Technique.</p><p>The successful condensation of the Red Ghost Inscription meant that the first stage of the Phantom Swords Technique, Spirits Controlling, was within reach. Xu Xiaoshou had reached the peak right from the start. He was not being arrogant!</p><p>“So, I’ve already taught you? When did that happen?” Mei Siren thought as he almost scratched his head. In the end, he half-raised his paper fan and put it down.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
