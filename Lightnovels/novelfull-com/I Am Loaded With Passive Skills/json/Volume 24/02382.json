Wherever it landed, chaos would be subdued!</p><p>Upon Gong Yang Mountain, atop Horn Peak.</p><p>A black meteor streaked across the sky, magnifying within the pupils in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Careful…</p><p>Yue Gongli swiftly dodged, avoiding a succession of arrows from the Evil Sin Bow that seemed to be targeting him. “What madness is this?” “In the plan, I didn’t ask you to intervene!”</p><p>Yue Gongli cursed at the sky.</p><p>He knew his intuition wouldn’t be wrong. If he hadn’t dodged just now, one of those arrows would have been aimed at him.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Nevertheless, he escaped the arrow unscathed; it was fine.</p><p>The arrows from the Evil Sin Bow hadn’t targeted any members of the Holy Divine Palace; they merely grazed past Yue Gongli and darted into the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>“Holy Emperor Fengtian has taken action!”</p><p>Near the Azure Dragon Range, Cen Qiaofu looked up in surprise, remnants of fear still lingering in his eyes.</p><p>His saint calamity had reached its peak, and no one dared to approach him.</p><p>With Wei An, Wang Dachui, Fangfang, and others released from the lock of the Great Shielding Technique, the intensity had diminished somewhat.</p><p>Although it hadn’t returned to its original strength, Cen Qiaofu was confident he could weather it.</p><p>During this period of transcending the tribulation, he destroyed countless divine arrays and restrained many individuals.</p><p>At the final moment, the Gray Fog Hand appeared, not only breaking the saint calamity but also forcibly interrupting his sanctification progress.</p><p>His demi-saint person was filled with energy.</p><p>But Cen Qiaofu was still at the higher void level.</p><p>Yet, despite the destruction of the saint calamity, there was no divine punishment whatsoever, nor did the calamity clouds reassemble for another onslaught.</p><p>Under the power of Holy Emperor Fengtian, the calamity of a demi-saint could be dispelled with ease!</p><p>“Or is it that Yue Gongli is truly on our side?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu gazed at the dim sky, briefly lost in confusion, unsure if this was coincidence or deliberate.</p><p>The outcome of this matter coincided with the final piece that Yue Gongli, their “ally,” had discussed as part of their plan.</p><p>—Yue Gongli used the Great Shielding Technique to interrupt his saint calamity only to summon it once more, further delaying the forces of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>At that time, Cen Qiaofu hadn’t agreed to anything. He merely played along, intending to make Yue Gongli lose faith in Dao Qiongcang, regardless of whether Yue Gongli was truly one of them.</p><p>But deep down, Cen Qiaofu knew that Yue Gongli had hit upon something. His proposal was, in fact, the primary task entrusted to him by the Chief.</p><p>Reaching into his pocket, Cen Qiaofu pulled out a piece of green stone fragment.</p><p>This was the “Corner of Divine Prison.</p><p>When the saint calamity reached its final moments, presenting this item would plunge the calamity into the unknown, allowing Cen Qiaofu to transcend the tribulation again.</p><p>This was leveraging the power of the Holy Emperor to exploit certain rule errors.</p><p>Aside from Holy Emperor Fengtian, only Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison, one of the Third Ancestors of the White Vein on the Inner Island of the Abyss Island, possessed such power.</p><p>Other Holy Emperors, no matter how strong, would find it difficult to achieve this.</p><p>But the Corner of Divine Prison could only be used once.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu hadn’t expected that before he could use this treasure, Holy Emperor Fengtian would intervene, halting the process of transcending the tribulation.</p><p>“The Chief never mentioned him…</p><p>“But he is indeed on our side. Perhaps he took action on his own, or maybe he noticed me and acted accordingly…”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu gripped the Pan Xian Ax tightly, hastening to heal himself. Regardless of whether Holy Emperor Fengtian acted on a whim, if Yue Gongli informed him, or even if there was a secret agreement between him and the Chief, it didn’t matter.</p><p>What mattered was that the current result was favorable.</p><p>Factoring in Yue Gongli’s “Great Shielding Technique” and his own “Corner of Divine Prison”…</p><p>He could transcend the calamity twice more!</p><p>“It’s like playing… no, like dreaming.”</p><p>“Considering Yue Gongli’s untrustworthiness and his ‘Great Shielding Technique’ from Dao Qiongcang, one must question: could the act of shielding against the transcendence of tribulation lead to even more dreadful consequences? Only time will tell.”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu steadied his resolve, clutching the Corner of Divine Prison. “One more chance!”</p><p>He raised his head, gazing into the distance.</p><p>Near the Azure Dragon Range, the terrain was like a dormant dragon, stretching endlessly. Cen Qiaofu knew that the Black Water Stream was close by.</p><p>Behind him, a group of red and white-clothed people followed.</p><p>If these people noticed the dissipation of the saint calamity, they would soon approach, like a pack of wolves ready to devour him.</p><p>One against many.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu didn’t have much confidence in dealing with so many people in the higher void level.</p><p>He didn’t want to repeat the mistakes of the Eighth Palace; that battle had left him severely injured.</p><p>Looking ahead.</p><p>On the cliff above the Black Water Stream, there were also a bunch of people…</p><p>“Enemies on all sides.”</p><p>“But even facing so many, I alone can hold them back, even more than last time… How does that saying go again?”</p><p>“One man can hold the pass against ten thousand enemies!”</p><p>With a serene smile, the Old Woodcutter exhaled, his aura resolute.</p><p>He tightened his grip on the Pan Xian Ax and stepped into the air, quickly arriving above the cliff of the Black Water Stream.</p><p>“Array Eye Number Three, Cen Qiaofu spotted!”</p><p>“This is the Black Water Stream; Saint Servant Cen Qiaofu is approaching!”</p><p>“Array Eye Number Three, Cheng Huan in position. Saint Servant Cen Qiaofu…</p><p>reporting to Hallmaster Dao, Cen Qiaofu’s saint calamity has disappeared?”</p><p>In the Heavenly Group’s combat channel, there was only the busy tone of “beep beep,” and no other voices could be heard.</p><p>Everyone was reporting, but there was no response from Hallmaster Dao.</p><p>This situation caused a brief panic among all the members of the Heavenly Group, who relied on this system for their operations.</p><p>Had the Heavenly Group’s communication device failed?</p><p>NO!</p><p>That was a product of Hallmaster Dao; it couldn’t fail!</p><p>“Cen Qiaofu’s movements are easily predictable, and Hallmaster Dao must have known about it long ago. His appearance at the Black Water Stream can only be expected….”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
