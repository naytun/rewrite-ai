There was indeed such an explanation:</p><p>Wei Feng must have faked it!</p><p>He had deliberately left him this jade scroll!</p><p>But if that was the case, then he should be the acting emperor, right?</p><p>The injuries he suffered did not seem like something that someone like him could withstand.</p><p>“Stop deceiving yourself, Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Jin Ren felt that his current psychological trauma was no less than what Wei Feng experienced. He desperately needed his main body to bear all of this so that he could go back and fish in peace.</p><p>He shook his head uncontrollably, but he told himself clearly.</p><p>“If I chose to forget about these things, I might really incur terrible consequences!”</p><p>The battle on Abyss Island ended. The Saint Servant won and the Holy Divine Palace lost.</p><p>He had long forgotten about the incident of ‘Abyss Island and Xu Xiaoshou appeared’. It was just a scary thing that caused him to have nightmares.</p><p>Now…</p><p>“F*ck your grandpa!”</p><p>He couldn’t figure it out, but he couldn’t stop thinking about it.</p><p>As soon as Jin Ren activated the Heart Sword Technique, he absorbed the devilish energy of the cultivation deviation that had gone berserk all over his body. Then, he flung away the scalding purple jade scroll frantically as if it was about to detonate.</p><p>He did not want such a disgusting thing to stay any longer in his palm, not even for a millisecond.</p><p>When he thought about how he had read the lines written by Dao Qiongcang for such a long time as he held this torn jade scroll, Jin Ren felt as if he had somehow gotten pregnant from afar. He had a violent urge to vomit!</p><p>D*mn Dao Qiongcang! F*cking Divine Secret!</p><p>“Whoosh.”</p><p>However, before it even exploded, the jade scroll known as the Collection of Excuses shed its cover and turned into a Divine Light Pattern. It shot back into Jin Ren’s palm.</p><p>Jin Ren’s eyes widened in fear.</p><p>He made a prompt decision and cut his right arm off with his left hand. Blood splattered as his entire right arm was severed.</p><p>He flipped it over and took a look.</p><p>It turned out that the Divine Light Pattern did not have any special power. It only turned into a simple and crude diagram that was engraved on his palm.</p><p>A diagram that showed a friendly ‘handshake’.</p><p>A small hand held a big hand that depicted the enthusiasm of old friends meeting across the air- a sense of lingering and returning.</p><p>The world suddenly fell silent.</p><p>In the disappearing state, Jin Ren was silent for quite some time. His eyes were blank as if his soul had left his body.</p><p>I’m infected…</p><p>In his mind, before he took action in the Four Symbols Secret Realm, Aunt Xiang’s stern warning jumped out.</p><p>“Don’t ever underestimate Elder Dao the Flamboyant!”</p><p>The key point was that I was just bragging. I’ve never underestimated him. How could this be…</p><p>Jin Ren gritted his teeth.</p><p>With a bang, he exerted force and the severed right arm was crushed.</p><p>With a menacing stare and with a Pfft sound, the flesh was reduced to ashes in the air and would never be found again in the world.</p><p>The ‘handshake’ diagram disappeared.</p><p>The power that formed it was so simple. It only used one Divine Array pattern and it disappeared easily from the palm of his right arm that had been cut off.</p><p>However, the power contained in this Divine Array pattern was so terrifying that it gripped Jin Ren’s heart.</p><p>“Just a ‘handshake’?”</p><p>“That’s all?”</p><p>Jin Ren did not believe in evil and he was convinced that Dao Qiongcang’s Divine Secret was not so simple. Perhaps some of the power had seeped into his body without being noticed.</p><p>He examined his body at the speed of light; he searched it inside and out no less than ten times, but he did not find anything special or unusual.</p><p>In fact, with the Holy Emperor Lv.o Weaving Expertise, he could tell that the Divine Array was just a Divine Array. If it was gone, then so be it. It was impossible for it to seep into the soul.</p><p>However, that cunning Dao Qiongcang could even come up with the words ‘Abyss Island, Xu Xiaoshou appeared’ and “Ran Ming Ruins, Xu Xiaoshou</p><p>appeared’…</p><p>This ‘Collection of Excuses’ had fallen into his hands after it turned around eighteen bends on the mountain road just to ‘shake hands’ with him…</p><p>Who would believe that!</p><p>“Kill yourself.”</p><p>The original body sent over a concise thought.</p><p>Jin Ren knew that he had many secrets.</p><p>If the second true body was infected but could not trace where the infection was, suicide was indeed the best choice.</p><p>He cried.</p><p>He cried and sent a thought over,</p><p>“But Boss, if I really committed suicide, then that annoying person might succeed!”</p><p>“He only used a copy of the Collection of Excuses!”</p><p>“A jade scroll is able to take the enemy’s head from a thousand miles away as easily as taking it out of a pocket. However, we didn’t even see his face before we died. We only shook his hand once and then we died!”</p><p>“This is a disgrace! If word gets out, we’ll be the second Wei Feng! We were the supporting roles in the story!”</p><p>“I understand.” Xu Xiaoshou corrected the second true body’s error. “But Second Brother, you have to remember that you’re the one who lost, not ‘we’. This is very important.”</p><p>“You are me, and I am you. Is this the time to differentiate?” Jin Ren burst into tears. “What if it had been you?!”</p><p>“There are no ifs. Even if there were, it would not change anything.”</p><p>“Wow! You’re really evil!”</p><p>The second true body was actually just whining. There were priorities, and he knew what was important.</p><p>The operation at the Ran Ming ruins could fail because the original intention was not there. However, in Qilin, the second true body could be reborn even if it died.</p><p>However, if his secret was exposed, it would be terrifying.</p><p>Only the heavens knew what kind of methods Dao Qiongcang would use to determine his own abilities. The jade scroll had been with him for a long time while he was in the disappearing state..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
