He fanned himself and played the role of a sickly young master. He spoke in a resentful tone.</p><p>“My guard Jin Ren set off in search of the aura of the ancient swordsman. When he reached He Ting Mountain, he bumped into Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>“If I hadn’t restrained them, they would have fought.’</p><p>Jin Ren took the initiative to look for him… Director Zhou’s heart skipped a beat. He thought of the deadly sword attacks from Jin Ren earlier and how he had gone downstairs to stop the dispute:</p><p>Xu Gusheng was suspected to be an anonymous disciple of the Eastern Region’s Burial Sword Tomb, the descendant of the higher void level.</p><p>His guard Jin Ren was an ancient swordsman. With just the 10 Sections of the Finger Sword, he was able to fend off the number two person of the Seven Constellations, Ghostface from the Ghost God gang.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, how strong is brother Jin Ren?” Director Zhou asked with a smile.</p><p>“Extremely strong.” Xu Xiaoshou looked upward and pointed at the ceiling with his paper fan.</p><p>“Extremely strong, so how strong is it?”</p><p>“He is the first Sword Deity below the sword saint!”</p><p>Director Zhou was about to take a sip of tea when he almost spat it out.</p><p>So, what you’re talking about is really the ceiling of the Way of the Sword?</p><p>What a joke.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, please don’t make such jokes…”</p><p>“I never make jokes about anything, even if it may sound like a joke to you. At that time, if it wasn’t for the fact that I didn’t want to be ostentatious, my guard Jin Ren would have a place in the listing of the Seven Sword Deity.” Director Zhou secretly rolled his eyes.</p><p>How could he not know that there was a ranking for this year’s Seven Sword Deity, and Saint Servant Lord Shou was ranked last among the Seven Sword Deity.</p><p>According to Xu Gusheng, if his guard Jin Ren could enter the rankings, wouldn’t the Saint Servant be pushed down the list?</p><p>How shameless!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t intend to explain how powerful Jin Ren was. Strength couldn’t be explained, but compared.</p><p>Let the bullets fly for a while first…</p><p>“Director Zhou, even if you are in the Three Incenses, you should have heard of Li Fuyu, right?” He fanned himself and leaned back in his seat as his posture became even more languid.</p><p>Director Zhou immediately became alert, but he did not understand what he meant. He could only nod. “Of course I have heard of her. The Seven Sword Deity Li Fuyu just entered the city not long ago.”</p><p>“Do you know where she is?”</p><p>“She’s at…” Director Zhou’s pupils dilated. “Yougui Pavilion.”</p><p>“Where did I spend the night before I came to the Three Incenses? Did Director</p><p>Zhou find out before he came downstairs to see me?”</p><p>“You, Yougui Pavilion…”</p><p>“Then who was Li Fuyu looking for?”</p><p>‘… Jin, Jin Ren?”</p><p>“Why did she look for him?”</p><p>Director Zhou was shocked.</p><p>He thought that it was just a coincidence. He did not think that there was such a reason. He hurriedly asked, “May I ask Young Master Xu, why did she look for brother Jin Ren?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t answer him directly. Instead, he smiled at Zhou who was a little obese and still insisted on growing a long beard. He closed the paper fan and knocked it against his head.</p><p>“Director Zhou, do you know anything about the ancient swordsman?”</p><p>“I don’t really know much…”</p><p>“Why do you think Jin Ren would look for Xu Xiaoshou, who is also an ancient swordsman? And how did Li Fuyu lock onto Jin Ren, who even you can’t see?”</p><p>Director Zhou felt his head itch. There must be some connection between them.</p><p>Judging from Xu Gusheng’s expression, it was obvious that he had given him some clues when he spoke earlier.</p><p>D*mn the riddler…</p><p>Director Zhou pondered for a long time before he finally came to a conclusion. He recalled a special word that Xu Gusheng had used when he talked about how his guard Jin Ren had found Xu Xiaoshou at the He Ting Mountain.</p><p>“Search?”</p><p>Director Zhou seemed to have solved a historical riddle. His eyes widened and he said in a hoarse voice.</p><p>“Young Master Xu said just now that he searched for the aura of an ancient swordsman…”</p><p>“The ancient swordsman can lock onto a location when he ‘searched’ for a certain aura?”</p><p>“This is the reason why Jin Ren managed to locate Xu Xiaoshou and why Li Fuyu found Brother Jin Ren?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shielded his face with the paper fan and smiled. He neither nodded nor shook his head.</p><p>He knew that the bullet had hit Director Zhou’s head at this moment.</p><p>Director Zhou was smart enough to find all the clues that he had given him just now.</p><p>The answers given by others were far less certain than the one he came up with.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that the story he had spun out of nowhere had taken root in Director Zhou’s mind.</p><p>Actually, if Director Zhou thought about it carefully, he would have realized that Young Master Xu did not tell much of the main story. He only gave some general and fragmented information.</p><p>However, these fragments could be pieced together in an intermittent manner. In the end, the story of how Xu Xiaoshou appeared in the He Ting Mountain would be pieced together in his mind.</p><p>Director Zhou already had a rough idea of the story. If he wanted, he could even retell the whole story.</p><p>This was a true self-justification!</p><p>And after he justified his statement, in addition to his deep belief, there would only be deep belief and no doubts.</p><p>“I’m very sorry, Brother Jin Ren. I underestimated you just now. I’ll drink three cups as punishment.”</p><p>Director Zhou’s eyes kept darting around. He seemed to have thought of something as he bowed towards the invisible Abyss Island.</p><p>Finally, he got up, poured three cups of wine, and gulped down all of it.</p><p>What a joke!</p><p>Even Li Fuyu wanted to look for Jin Ren to discuss about the Ancient Sword Technique.</p><p>It was easy to imagine how strong Xu Gusheng’s guard was.</p><p>What he had displayed earlier downstairs was definitely not his true strength!</p><p>After he drank three cups, Director Zhou looked at the sickly young master on the bench and said seriously.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, I really didn’t know that Brother Jin Ren was so powerful. Even the Seven Sword Deity Li Fuyu wanted to test his strength. I was rude just now. I will punish myself again….”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
