Huge dark clouds loomed slowly on the horizon.</p><p>All the trial-takers once again trembled in fear.</p><p>“Someone transcended the tribulation again?”</p><p>“What’s going on with the Holy Palace Trial? Are the people still allowed to train there?”</p><p>“It’s already ridiculous enough that someone had undergone sanctification here. But now, it seems like there’s more than one?”</p><p>“No, brother, look at the cloud this time. It doesn’t seem to be a calamity cloud.</p><p>Instead, it looks extremely similar… mushroom cloud?”</p><p>“I don’t care if it’s a calamity cloud; it doesn’t matter if it’s a mushroom or not. You just said that we were able to see traces of the battle in the Green Dragon lineage in the south of the Vermilion Bird lineage. Was this also part of the trial?”</p><p>The trial-takers were collectively silenced.</p><p>After they entered the Four Symbols Secret Realm for some time, 90% of the trial-takers no longer suppressed their cultivation levels. They displayed their divine powers and broke through to the Master Stage.</p><p>Among the extreme evil-doers, some had even advanced instantly to the Sovereign Stage.</p><p>However, the number of Sovereign Dao Realm was the highest. It was impossible for the Cutting Path to achieve this.</p><p>After all, there was a huge threshold of Enlightenment between the two that required a lot of time to settle.</p><p>Not everyone was like Cen Qiaofu, who sensed something in the morning and by evening was already at the Cutting Path Stage.</p><p>Even Cen Qiaofu, who seemed to have accomplished it overnight, had spent half his life accumulating it.</p><p>Most of the trial-takers were young and could not reach that level.</p><p>As for the Sovereign Dao Realm, if they had gone to the saint calamity area to participate in the trial, they might not even be able to walk out alive if they were affected by the explosions of the Azure Dragon lineage.</p><p>“I wonder what are the thoughts of the trial-takers who were randomly teleported to the vicinity of the Black Tortoise lineage and the Green Dragon lineage now?”</p><p>“Perhaps, what Xu Gusheng said in the Golden Phoenix Square was right.”</p><p>“The Ran Ming ruins will appear at the Four Symbols Secret Realm. We trial-takers are just a foil. The battle of the Struggle for the Great Path is just the backdrop?”</p><p>“At the Black Tortoise Lineage, Fangfang had been displaced. We had no choice but to run first. We’re being pursued, come and support us!”</p><p>“At the Black Tortoise lineage… Wang Dachui… send the backup quickly! Cen Qiaofu is a mad dog that bites everyone in his way. He wants to use the saint calamity to harm us!”</p><p>At the start of the saint calamity, Wang Dachui and Fangfang had long been unable to protect the array eye of the Black Tortoise Golden Tower.</p><p>The moment Cen Qiaofu stepped out of the spatial crack, he underwent the sanctification forcibly. He dumped this on them from the start and was completely unreasonable.</p><p>In comparison, in the Holy Divine Palace, whether it was Ao Sheng’s Clone, Beibei, Fangfang, or Wang Dachui…</p><p>Almost everyone still had the mentality that the battle for the Four Symbols Secret Realm should be carried out step by step like the one at the Abyss Island. It should be a push and pull attack between the enemy and themselves.</p><p>After all, all the members of the Heavenly Group had gathered before and analyzed the situation on Abyss Island under the guidance of Hallmaster Dao.</p><p>It was also due to this!</p><p>The members of the Heavenly Group were caught off guard.</p><p>Because this time, the Saint Servant did not follow the planned routine.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu held the Pan Xian Ax and the semi-saint person in his hand. He was bombarded by the saint calamity from all directions. He was like a brute who had barged into a deserted place and wreaked havoc everywhere.</p><p>After he was done with the execution of his skill at the start and entered the berserk stage, he struck the Black Tortoise Golden Tower with his first axe slash.</p><p>The Black Tortoise Golden Tower exploded.</p><p>Divine path patterns lit up the surroundings.</p><p>The Divine Array that had been set up in advance swallowed half of the axe’s power and removed the other half. It underwent a transformation as it converted into his own energy storage and remained hidden until it was time to launch a counterattack.</p><p>Fangfang who stood at the top of the tower lost his balance and was sent flying by the power of the Pan Xian Ax.</p><p>He was only a higher void.</p><p>And Cen Qiaofu was undergoing sanctification.</p><p>Under the saint calamity, anyone who dared to leak any aura or spiritual source would definitely be targeted by the saint calamity.</p><p>Fangfang was just a little muscular, but it did not mean that he was very bold.</p><p>He was not confident that he would not be affected by someone else’s saint calamity and undergo his own saint calamity as he had just become a higher void.</p><p>On the other side, Cen Qiaofu whose eyes were bloodshot but otherwise calm, seized the opportunity to capture the Black Tortoise Golden Tower.</p><p>He didn’t say utter a word. He just laughed and looked up at the sky as he raised up the Pan Xian Ax.</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>The streak of light from the tribulation thunderbolt flashed and lit up the dark world for a moment.</p><p>On the top of the Golden Tower, the Old Woodcutter stood calmly with his back against the wilderness as his axe pointed at the Nine Heavens calamity cloud.</p><p>He was just a tiny human, and his back was slightly hunched.</p><p>At this moment, his aura was as strong as a God’s. It was as if he could split the sky with a single blow from his axe.</p><p>“Tribulation!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu swung the Pan Xian Ax downward.</p><p>Within a radius of tens of thousands of miles, the wild forests and mountains were completely shattered by this attack. Ancient trees cracked and the earth collapsed.</p><p>The Nine Heavens calamity cloud seemed to have been provoked and expanded!</p><p>Fangfang was already far away from the center of the saint calamity. His eyes were wide open, and his eyeballs quivered.</p><p>The bolts of lightning that descended from the sky drowned out the figure of the Old Woodcutter who pointed his axe at the sky over the Black Tortoise Golden Tower.</p><p>This scene was like a ripple that spread outward in the depths of Fangfang’s soul. It was magnified time and again.</p><p>“Boom boom…”</p><p>The sound of thunder nearby and the roar in the distance resonated with each other.</p><p>Fangfang had clearly not revealed even the slightest bit of spiritual source aura on his body.</p><p>At this moment, he seemed to be affected by the saint calamity. The thick and long black hairs on his arms stood on end.</p><p>A feeling like a jolt of electric arose in his heart, and ended with a slight numbness on his scalp.</p><p>“A real man should be like this…” Fangfang only had time to mutter this.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Divine Array of the Black Tortoise Golden Tower could no longer withstand the bombardment of the saint calamity’s lightning bolts. The accumulated power was too excessive and finally exploded..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
