In their impression, there had never been such a strong demi-saint.</p><p>Trial-takers from Dongtianwang City in the Eastern Region gazed into the distant sky, their minds replaying the shocking scene of waves destroying arrows of evil sin, murmuring in awe:</p><p>“Water Ghost…”</p><p>“He’s called Water Ghost, the demi-saint of Upanishad!”</p><p>Once upon a time, Ai Cangsheng shot an arrow toward the Yunlun Mountain Range, and Water Ghost needed the power of the Sea God’s Trident to withstand it.</p><p>Even then, when the Higher Void resisted the demi-saint’s arrow, being only pushed back half a step, it left behind an astonishing legend.</p><p>And now, just over a month later, Water Ghost returned, and the Arrows of Evil Sin Bow couldn’t harm him in the slightest.</p><p>He effortlessly redirected the arrows and sent them back to Ai Cangsheng. “The pinnacle of spiritual cultivation, the only one of our times!” “This is the goal of us spiritual cultivators, the demi-saint of Upanishad!” “Wow, I’ve seen a living demi-saint of Upanishad. Is this a dream…”</p><p>Some people recalled carefully and realized that in this world, there were some spiritual cultivators who mastered the power of Upanishad, and some demi-saint who developed the power of spiritual cultivation to the extreme.</p><p>But as for the demi-saints who cultivated the power of Upanishad, it seemed that Water Ghost was the only one.</p><p>If he didn’t reach the peak, there would be no first in spiritual cultivation. Today, this person reached the top, becoming the greatest demi-saint!</p><p>“Water Ghost, the strongest demi-saint?”</p><p>“No! Why does such a person exist in the world, and I only heard of him today?</p><p>This is not right, what is his origin?”</p><p>Some people were puzzled, apparently unaware of the relationship between Water Ghost, Saint Servant, and even the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>But there were many gossipers in the five regions. After the battle on Abyss Island, various versions of stories had been circulating for a long time.</p><p>“If you haven’t heard of Water Ghost, that’s normal.”</p><p>“Because decades ago, Water Ghost had another name… the Chief of the Spirit</p><p>Division, Great Demon King Yu MO!” “Spirit Division? Yu Lingdi’s father?”</p><p>“I don’t know, maybe…”</p><p>Discussions were everywhere.</p><p>Water Ghost shattered two arrows with three shots, paying respects to Ai Cangsheng, a scene that even moved the demi-saints.</p><p>On the Shengshen Continent, there were geniuses everywhere, with talents and potential aplenty. However, each one would encounter various accidents or interruptions during their growth process, and some met premature ends. The ones who eventually matured were few and far between.</p><p>Even among those who achieved some success, it couldn’t be said that all of them had fully utilized their talents and potentials to the utmost.</p><p>They each had their strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>Someone like Water Ghost, who exhausted half his life in cultivation… When all his talents bore fruit and all his potential transformed into strength, even the first to be sanctified like Wei An might have to yield slightly to him.</p><p>Saint Servant had produced a supreme demi-saint!</p><p>On the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, in the Saint Hall.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng watched as the Arrows of Evil Sin Bow came from the sky, hitting the protective array of the mountain, his eyes darkening.</p><p>“Someone, come!”</p><p>In the spacious hall, as the echo lingered, a young boy appeared.</p><p>Wearing palace robes, the dignified Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body followed, raising a hand to stop the boy and shaking her head softly:</p><p>“Little Yu MO has become a demi-saint of Upanishad. Do not underestimate him anymore.”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng gazed back and said solemnly:</p><p>“First, The Divine punched through Jade Capital; then, Water Ghost sent arrows back to Saint Mountain.”</p><p>“A little disturbance every three days, a major one every five days. If Dao Qiongcang is absent even for a moment, the plaque of Saint Hall will have to be removed for them tomorrow?”</p><p>The Ninth Divine Priest had nothing to say.</p><p>Indeed, if there was no response from Saint Mountain after this arrow…</p><p>Would there be turmoil afterward? Everyone wanted to test the Holy Divine Palace, to see if they are truly as strong as they claimed.</p><p>“Please, Ninth Divine Priest, push me to the front of the hall, and leave the rest to me.”</p><p>The boy waiting in the Saint Hall was shocked by the command.</p><p>Pushing the wheelchair was his task, how could he let the esteemed Ninth Divine Priest do it?</p><p>He hurried forward, intending to speak up.</p><p>The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body glanced at the motionless black cloth draped on Ai Cangsheng’s thigh, sensing the surging power inside this boy’s body, as if lost in thought.</p><p>Yesterday, the boy pushed the wooden wheelchair.</p><p>At this moment, the boy couldn’t possibly push the wheelchair.</p><p>“You step aside, let me do it.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>With such a direct command, the boy dared not question and silently left.</p><p>The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body placed her hands on the wheelchair’s backrest and pushed Ai Cangsheng out of the Saint Hall.</p><p>The view of heaven and earth instantly became clear.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>“Ninth Divine Priest, rest assured.”</p><p>The tense atmosphere made the Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body furrow her brows slightly, sensing something strange.</p><p>But if even Little Ai Cangsheng said so, what could she do?</p><p>“Be careful.” She said softly, “What arrow are you going to use?”</p><p>“The Arrow of Evil God.” Ai Cangsheng lifted a corner of the black cloth on his thigh, and a demonic aura permeated his surroundings, turning into devilish claws and howling.</p><p>“One hundred feet.’</p><p>As soon as he spoke, the Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body quickly retreated one hundred feet, looking dignified and astonished..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
