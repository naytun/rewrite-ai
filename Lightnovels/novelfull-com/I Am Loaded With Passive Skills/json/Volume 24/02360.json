He had seen the injustice and shamelessness.</p><p>“Ungrateful! ”</p><p>When the lightning bolt struck, the Pan Xian Ax that was condensed with the true intent of ‘slash’ was flung across by Cen Qiaofu, who leaned back to accumulate the power, from a distance.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The flying axe tore through the air and created a sonic boom. It caught up with the fleeing Wang Dachui in an instant.</p><p>“Save me!”</p><p>Wang Dachui roared into the Heavenly Group’s battle channel as he griped that no one who was worthy to take on the heavy responsibility had turned up even after such a long time. At the same time, he turned and looked behind him, his gaze as ferocious as a hyena.</p><p>He couldn’t allow his back to be hit by such a fatal blow.</p><p>However, the Pan Xian Ax, that emitted a fierce light, did not spare anyone.</p><p>This attack even covered the spiritual source, and was followed closely by the saint calamity lightning. If it hit, it would definitely kill. It was not something that even the Eight Doors could withstand.</p><p>The world seemed to slow down for a moment. Wang Dachui released a long sigh and then his entire body lit up with a blazing light.</p><p>“Beast Path! ”</p><p>His bloodshot eyes immediately sank into his protruding brow bones, and brownish-yellow hair sprouted all over his body. There were even more irregular black-brown spots on his body.</p><p>His nose and mouth protruded forward. His originally human-shaped head now looked more like a dog’s.</p><p>Wang Dachui transformed into a half-human hyena!</p><p>“Woo!”</p><p>A high-pitched howl followed by an unusual low growl sounded.</p><p>Wang Dachui’s upper body leaned downward, and his four limbs clawed at the space, and caused the void to shatter.</p><p>The Pan Xian Ax pierced through his head, but it only shattered a shadow.</p><p>Before the saint calamity descended, Wang Dachui pounced on the half-bodied Fangfang in the nick of time. He gathered Fangfang up in his mouth and sprang off with a kick of his hind feet.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>The sky was filled with lightning sparks.</p><p>The extremely sharp claws tore the saint calamity lightning into pieces!</p><p>“Ancient martial arts, Six Paths?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s heart trembled.</p><p>If Wang Dachui knew the Six Paths, even if it was just one of them, why would he need to escape?</p><p>Even in front of Cen Qiaofu, it was possible for him to tear apart the saint calamity, one by one!</p><p>Fortunately, Wang Dachui’s first attack after he activated the Beast Path wasn’t directed at him. Cen Qiaofu could tell from Wang Dachui’s attack that there was something wrong with Wang Dachui.</p><p>His blood essence burnt rapidly.</p><p>In such a state, Wang Dachui might not be able to hold on for more than twenty to thirty breaths and would die from exhaustion.</p><p>“Woo!”</p><p>Wang Dachui, who had Fangfang in his grip, seemed to have lost most of his rationality.</p><p>However, he did not swallow the body in his mouth. Instead, he flung it into the sky.</p><p>Another pounce!</p><p>Cen Qiaofu was shocked when he realized that he couldn’t keep up with Wang Dachui’s speed, and subconsciously turned around to block him.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>As expected, the human-shaped hyena pounced out of the spatial crack. Its claws tore at Cen Qiaofu’s back, buttocks, and thighs and shredded his protective spiritual source into pieces.</p><p>Under the onslaught of the attack, Cen Qiaofu’s butt was immediately mangled.</p><p>Pain assaulted him, and Cen Qiaofu didn’t dare to delay any longer. With a ferocious look in his eyes, he retreated temporarily.</p><p>“Woo!”</p><p>The mournful shriek rang out in his ears again.</p><p>Wang Dachui, in his hyena form, was so fast that after he tore apart another saint calamity above Fangfang’s head, he quickly rushed to Cen Qiaofu’s side.</p><p>One defense and one attack, both did not delay.</p><p>“Dog!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu was furious.</p><p>This vicious dog actually dared to barge into the center of the saint calamity and wanted to tear him apart. Even if it did not release its spiritual source, it would still be locked on by the saint calamity later.</p><p>How can you catch tiger cubs if you did not venture into the tiger’s den?</p><p>Wang Dachui had this thought, but Cen Qiaofu was not weak.</p><p>He took out another axe from his ring and swung it at his back. At the same time, he kicked out.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>This axe was directly shattered by Wang Dachui’s claws in his hyena form.</p><p>Even Cen Qiaofu’s fierce whip kick was snapped at by Wang Dachui, who dashed forward without any regard for his life.</p><p>Rip!</p><p>A tearing sound rang out.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s right leg was torn off by Wang Dachui and blood and flesh splattered everywhere.</p><p>This blow was painful.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu grunted. He wasn’t like those physique cultivators. The pain from his ripped off limb almost made him lose control of the battle.</p><p>However, he was still an experienced old hand. Cen Qiaofu suppressed the pain and stretched out his hand…</p><p>“Pan Xian Slash! ”</p><p>A slight tearing sound could be heard.</p><p>Wang Dachui, who had almost lost his mind, did not notice this.</p><p>When Cen Qiaofu’s leg was ripped off, the Pan Xian Ax that he had thrown in the distance came slashing over and cut the hyena-shaped Wang Dachui in half.</p><p>It was a simple and neat move!</p><p>“Woo…”</p><p>Flesh and blood splattered everywhere, and a sense of heartbreak filled the sky.</p><p>The pain of being split into two finally pulled the berserk Wang Dachui back to reality.</p><p>There were indeed too few ancient martial arts inheritances that were mastered in the Physique Division.</p><p>He had studied the incomplete Six Paths for half his life, but he still couldn’t complete it.</p><p>As for the incomplete version of the Six Paths of ancient martial arts, no one could control it, not even The Divine.</p><p>When used to launch a counterattack before death, it could knock down most enemies, but it definitely couldn’t kill a fierce person like Cen Qiaofu.</p><p>Furthermore, the price to use the incomplete Six Paths was extremely heavy.</p><p>The Beast Path, the art of transforming into a hyena could greatly increase one’s combat strength, but as the battle progressed, one’s intelligence decreased gradually.</p><p>Wang Dachui’s bloodshot eyes were filled with regret and unwillingness.</p><p>Once he activated this Beast Path, there was no turning back.</p><p>He thought that perhaps it would be better to die a dignified death now. It would be better than if he went berserk and wreaked havoc everywhere. In the end, he would be stopped and killed by the people from the Holy Palace..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
