Perhaps he would die directly?</p><p>However, the 16 ancient characters on the star scroll had divine power and didn’t seem to be evil.</p><p>Anyway, he was going to die. Why not give it a try?</p><p>With this thought, Jin Ren could see through his Perception that many of the red and white-clothed people on the high cliff had disappeared.</p><p>“Did they recite the ‘name’?”</p><p>Not only did many of the red and white-clothed people disappear…</p><p>It was just that in an instant, the number of trial-takers in the Four Symbols Secret Realm had also decreased greatly.</p><p>Wei An lay on the ground and almost recited the name. He stopped in time and flew into the sky. Soon his Saint Language spread in all directions.</p><p>“Don’t recite!”</p><p>This shout was meant to spread to all the trial-takers in the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>The god slayer was rumored to be as strong as the Ten Ancestors.</p><p>How could a mere Innate Stage or Master Stage trial-taker be involved in an inheritance of this level?</p><p>If a demi-saint tried this, his life would be in danger!</p><p>In the secret realm, all those who could still remain calm after they heard the Saint Language and were not swallowed up by greed stopped reciting the name. They were terrified.</p><p>But suddenly, a ray of divine light descended from the Galaxy and enveloped Wei An.</p><p>With a swish, Wei An disappeared from everyone’s sight.</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>Did Wei An recite the name?</p><p>He couldn’t resist the temptation of the Ran Ming ruins?</p><p>Water Ghost was also on the high cliff. Before he could react, the divine light from the Galaxy descended again and enveloped him.</p><p>He let out a cry of surprise, but it was useless.</p><p>Water Ghost disappeared!</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu was stunned. His saint calamity had already descended, but it was so insignificant compared to the Arrow of Evil God and the Galaxy in the sky. When the first saint calamity struck, the divine light also engulfed him.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu had disappeared!</p><p>“It’s not just those who recited their true names that will be guided into the Ran Ming ruins. Xu Xiaoshou, we’ve been targeted for a long time. I’m afraid we won’t be able to escape!”</p><p>On the Black Water Stream, Feng Yujin, who was extremely sensitive to matters that concerned his life, immediately came to a conclusion.</p><p>He made a prompt decision and pulled out the sealing bracelet on his wrist that he had injected his aura into. Then, he threw it away in one go.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, look for me. Otherwise, under the Spell Forbidden Barrier, I…</p><p>Momo will die!”</p><p>Divine light descended from the sky.</p><p>Only then did Jin Ren managed to grab the bracelet.</p><p>Feng Yujin’s eyes were filled with fear. He was enveloped by the divine light and disappeared!</p><p>“Did he make a correct guess?”</p><p>Jin Ren looked up and felt the Galaxy in the sky enlarge in his eyes.</p><p>His consciousness was in a chaotic state.</p><p>The world in his Perception also became blurry.</p><p>Above the Black Water Stream, the Godhood-Sealing Coffin and Wei Feng fell, and created ripples as they sank into the deep water.</p><p>In front of the Saint Hall of the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>The Galaxy was reflected in Ai Canghseng’s eyes, and the Path Principles appeared in them too. Suddenly, he turned to look behind him.</p><p>“Ninth Divine Priest, guard the Saint mountain.”</p><p>“The five regions are about to fall into chaos. Find Dao Qiongcang. He can deal with this chaos.”</p><p>The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body looked at the Star Scroll for a long time and wanted to say something but hesitated.</p><p>She was filled with confusion about everything that had happened.</p><p>However, Ai Cangsheng seemed to know the whole story, but from his tone…</p><p>“Buzz! ”</p><p>Divine light descended from the sky.</p><p>Before she could say anything.</p><p>The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body grabbed the osmanthus wheelchair and fell into deep thought as she watched the figure on it disappear.</p><p>At Cross Corner Street.</p><p>In the dim lounge, The Divine who sweated profusely, looked up. His vision passed through layers of obstacles and saw the magnificent Star Scroll.</p><p>His eyes were solemn.</p><p>“Xiang’er…”</p><p>Xiang Yaoyao who exited the Cross Corner Street was part of the plan.</p><p>If his deductions were correct, she would soon enter the Four Symbols Secret Realm, and the Ran Ming ruins would appear in the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>After a pause, The Divine no longer hesitated and said.</p><p>“Ran Ming.”</p><p>Divine light descended from the sky.</p><p>The Divine disappeared!</p><p>Dead Sea.</p><p>Sang Qiye, who was normally manic, welcomed a short period of peace.</p><p>He was used to picking fights with Gou Wuyue when he lost control. When he was awake, he would chat about life when he had leisure time. If he didn’t, he would continue to fight.</p><p>He also remembered that the seat he sat on should be Old Gou’s seclusion place.</p><p>And now…</p><p>He was gone.</p><p>Ever since their last conversation, Gou Wuyue hadn’t been to the Dead Sea. No one knew where he had gone.</p><p>Sang Qiye raised his head, and the Star Scroll was reflected in his tired eyes.</p><p>He did not know what had happened in the outside world, but this thing appeared in his spiritual world, just like the ancient words above:</p><p>“All living beings are equal…”</p><p>“You even took care of me in the Dead Sea?”</p><p>Sang Qiye pondered for a while and called out softly.</p><p>“Ran Ming.”</p><p>Swish.</p><p>Divine light descended from the sky.</p><p>Sang Qiye disappeared!</p><p>All over the five regions.</p><p>Not only at the Cross Corner Street, the Dead Sea, but the Star Scroll was also displayed in any place that God could look down upon.</p><p>It didn’t matter if it was sealed, dirty, or restricted by certain people, rules, or morals..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
