Or do you not believe me?”</p><p>“Or perhaps, what’s giving you pressure isn’t just the seal of the Four Symbols Secret Realm?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind worked quickly, questioning dubiously, “Senior, as a Holy Emperor, only other Holy Emperors could instill fear in you. Are you afraid of the five major Holy Emperor aristocratic families?”</p><p>Woo…</p><p>In the shattered world, a mournful wind echoed inexplicably, and even Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but feel the faint sadness within.</p><p>Qilin’s eyes surged with killing intent, sudden and intense!</p><p>The hazy black mist that concealed its body dissipated, revealing the true body of Holy Emperor Qilin.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou widened his eyes as he beheld the Holy Emperor Qilin, a creature with the head of a lion and sheep, the body of a deer, and the tail of a unicorn, clad in scales.</p><p>Its entire body was black and gold, with huge deep blue eyes even larger than Elder Sang’s.</p><p>Even its undereye bore heavy black lines, reminiscent of tear marks, flowing down its face.</p><p>“Human!”</p><p>Qilin let out a roar, raising its claw in anger.</p><p>Its front limbs were so massive that they could rival those of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon of Abyss Island, whose dragon body alone could cover the entire sky of Abyss Island.</p><p>With a movement, black mist surged, and the world collapsed with thunder.</p><p>The massive claw enlarged in Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils, and he didn’t know which sentence had provoked Holy Emperor Qilin.</p><p>But he wasn’t the timid Jin Ren, who would run away at the sight of a demi-saint!</p><p>With a set of passive skills, the power of the ancestral source, and a body filled with treasures… After the upgrades, Xu Xiaoshou was confident that he could fight against any demi-saint in the world!</p><p>And now…</p><p>“Little Qilin, trapped as you are, how dare you show such insolence? Do you really think I, Xu Xiaoshou, am showing you deference?”</p><p>As the claw approached, Xu Xiaoshou moved forward instead of retreating.</p><p>At this moment, the power of the Heavenly Ancestor could no longer completely fill his body. His passive skills were constantly absorbing, strengthening, and enhancing himself.</p><p>Of course, the immense power of the Heavenly Ancestor still brought limitations, preventing Xu Xiaoshou from acting recklessly.</p><p>But after swallowing ninety-nine Dragon Apricot seeds, he gained not only the power of the Dragon Ancestor but also the central power that could perfectly resolve such limitations—the Dragon Pearl!</p><p>In this moment of crisis, Xu Xiaoshou unhesitatingly chose to activate the Dragon Pearl in his chest. Instantly, most of the power of the Heavenly Ancestor in his body was stored in the Dragon Pearl.</p><p>A person who was ninety percent full couldn’t possibly bend over.</p><p>But if the accumulated energy in the stomach could be digested in an instant, then the person would be able to move freely.</p><p>And this was the case for Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>With the overflowing power of the Heavenly Ancestor temporarily finding an outlet, he seized the moment of relaxation and thrust forward to confront the claw.</p><p>“Berserk Giant!”</p><p>The Holy Emperor transformed, strengthened, and then transformed into a Berserk Giant.</p><p>This time was different from before. Xu Xiaoshou’s awakened skill was no longer limited by his body size, rapidly surging in size.</p><p>In the eyes of Qilin, it only pressed its claw down, but the seemingly insignificant human suddenly burst forth with overwhelming force, turning into a Golden Giant equivalent in size to itself.</p><p>Qilin had to redirect its pressing claw into a forward strike.</p><p>The Golden Giant’s crimson eyes flashed with excitement. No longer borrowing other powers, he relied solely on his own strength as he delivered a punch.</p><p>“Exploding Posture!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The shattered world shook violently, bursting with endless waves of energy.</p><p>As the claw and fist clashed, Qilin remained motionless, while Xu Xiaoshou, the Berserk Giant, felt every organ convulse as if struck by lightning.</p><p>The golden light on his body cracked, almost reverting him to his original form by a claw.</p><p>Retreating a few steps, the Golden Giant opened up tens of thousands of miles in this shattered world, stabilizing the various backlashes surging within him.</p><p>“Strong!”</p><p>“Even when sealed, you’re still so strong. Truly worthy of being an ancient Qilin!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sincerely praised, his eyes shining brightly.</p><p>The power of the Heavenly Ancestor amplified his physique, as did the power of the Dragon Ancestor.</p><p>All of his major extended passive skills were also of “Holy Emperor” level, further amplifying his physique.</p><p>Even so, his punch still couldn’t overpower the weakened Qilin. Was this the power of ancient Saint Beasts?</p><p>“Come again!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not discouraged but instead felt a sense of exhilaration.</p><p>When he broke through to the level of the Apricot Realm, he knew that in the current world, apart from The Divine, perhaps no one could suppress him based solely on physical strength—excluding ghost beasts like the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>Never did he expect that Holy Emperor Qilin could bring such pressure.</p><p>This was great!</p><p>At this moment, with the weakened true body of the Holy Emperor, wasn’t it the best touchstone to test his combat power after his breakthrough?</p><p>Seeing the excitement in the eyes of the Golden Giant who was on the verge of shattering, Qilin was briefly taken aback.</p><p>Was this a human?</p><p>For the first time, it had a slight doubt about this human’s racial identity.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
