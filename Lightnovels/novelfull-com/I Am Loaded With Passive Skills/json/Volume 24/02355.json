This enthusiast for explosions was as consistent as ever.</p><p>“This guy is too sly!” Feng Yujin couldn’t help but exclaim in shock.</p><p>The Little Frost Ferret trembled, leaping into Lord Shou’s arms.</p><p>In this Black Water Stream ahead, without Lord Shou leading the way, he wouldn’t take a single step out of line.</p><p>“I’ll take you guys down.”</p><p>Jin Ren smiled at MO MO, then pulled out a table, a chair, a pot of hot water, and a cup of good tea from the spatial ring.</p><p>“What a pity.’</p><p>“If only Xiao Wanfeng were here, that would be great.”</p><p>Jin Ren sighed, realizing that time was running out. He summoned a lifelike portrait clone of Xu Xiaoshou from the Apricot Realm and tossed it onto the table.</p><p>“Who will be the first lucky one?”</p><p>He looked up at the distant sky, sensing countless rapidly approaching auras, and then turned around.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Jin Ren led MO MO and Elder Han, turning every three steps and retreating every five steps, and leaped off the cliff.</p><p>“Hold on!”</p><p>Black Water Stream, before the collapsed mountain, white-clothed Cheng Huan waved his hand, stopping his companion.</p><p>He was a Higher Void.</p><p>He could see at a glance that a battle had taken place here.</p><p>Moreover, Hallmaster Dao had just informed everyone on the channel that Saint Servant Lord Shou had appeared at this location in the Black Water Stream.</p><p>Even the newly appointed Spirit Division Chief, Ao Sheng, had been crushed to pieces in three breaths.</p><p>They had to be cautious!</p><p>“Old Cheng, seems like there’s someone over there?” Someone pointed to the cliff’s edge, where a figure was spotted amidst the drifting black mist.</p><p>Cheng Huan’s heart tightened, and he swept his spiritual senses, seeing the whole picture.</p><p>At the cliff edge, in the whistling cold wind, there was a wooden table, a cup of tea, and a figure sitting arrogantly with legs crossed on the table.</p><p>Leaning back, he rested against the chair’s back, its four legs now standing on two, causing it to sway precariously.</p><p>The person on the chair leisurely shook his head, blowing on the hot tea in his hands.</p><p>The cold wind carried away the steam rising from the tea cup and revealed the face of the young man with crumbs on his lips, tinged with a trace of mischief.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Recognizing the person, Cheng Huan’s face turned ashen.</p><p>Lord Shou of the Saint Servant was waiting for him alone at the cliff’s edge of the Black Water Stream!</p><p>“No, he’s not waiting for me. I’m not worthy…”</p><p>Cheng Huan looked at his companion, realizing that the second-in-command Saint Servant Lord Shou wasn’t waiting for them either.</p><p>Neither of them was worthy.</p><p>Cheng Huan chose to report directly.</p><p>“Array Eye Number Eighteen, white-clothed Cheng Huan in position.” “I found a Saint Servant… Xu Xiaoshou at the cliff’s edge. He’s… uh, drinking tea.”</p><p>“Array Eye Number Eighteen, requesting backup!”</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>Swoosh, swoosh!</p><p>Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh…</p><p>One figure after another descended.</p><p>In this place, what started with two people transformed into seven, then eighteen, twenty-three, and thirty-six people…</p><p>Among them were individuals from special departments, dressed in white, red, and even other colors.</p><p>Yet without exception, upon landing or under Cheng Huan’s deterrence, or upon their own discovery of something, they dared not take another step forward.</p><p>They froze in place at the edge of the cliff, a safe distance of a hundred meters from the figure at the tea table.</p><p>Their eyes widened as they tried to identify, gasping in surprise, then whispering to each other.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“Lord Shou, the Saint Servant?”</p><p>“What’s going on? How dare he wait for us alone in this place?”</p><p>“Huh? He’s Xu Xiaoshou, the one who even defeated Rao Yaoyao and killed Ao Sheng’s clone. What does he have to fear?”</p><p>“You should be asking why so many of us have been waiting here for so long, and he doesn’t even bother to speak to us.”</p><p>“Hush, don’t elevate others’ spirits at the expense of our glory. Let’s wait for the higher-ups to arrive!”</p><p>“Damn! This Lord Shou is too despicable…”</p><p>Amidst the discussions, someone couldn’t contain themselves, took half a step back, and shouted, “Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>The air abruptly fell silent.</p><p>Numerous Cutting Path and Higher Void individuals united as a force, as if facing a mortal enemy. Cold sweat trickled down their foreheads, and they dared not blink as they cursed the person who had shouted out loud.</p><p>Could Xu Xiaoshou be stopped by a mere coalescence of Cutting Path and Higher Void individuals?</p><p>“Phew…”</p><p>A chilly wind rustled through, whistling past.</p><p>On the mountain cliff, all that could be heard was the sound of the Holy Divine Palace disciples’ robes fluttering in the wind.</p><p>Behind the tea table, the reclining figure leisurely sipping tea remained unmoved, still blowing on the hot tea before drinking it.</p><p>“Damn it!” someone muttered under their breath.</p><p>At the edge of the cliff, the wind suddenly intensified, and the temperature seemed to drop slightly.</p><p>“Retreat!!!”</p><p>Cheng Huan’s scalp tingled, and with lightning-fast reflexes, he roared.</p><p>Standing in front of the formation, he was one of the few prime targets for potential attacks, desperately wishing to push everyone behind him away from this place.</p><p>In an instant, everyone retreated a hundred and fifty meters away.</p><p>As the wind subsided, the temperature remained the same—cold, as if it hadn’t changed at all.</p><p>It was only then that everyone realized it was a false alarm, a mere gust of wind.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was still sipping tea, never lifting a finger.</p><p>“The second-in-command Saint Servant…”</p><p>“The pressure, was it really that intense?”</p><p>Cheng Huan’s right eyelid twitched incessantly; he tightly gripped his long spear, his back already soaked with cold sweat.</p><p>Everyone felt deeply embarrassed by their actions just moments ago, yet what he saw was a young man’s imposing presence that numerous elderly seniors could not bear.</p><p>“Hell….’</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
