It raised its little paw and promised, “I will be fine. I will definitely bring you to the Ran Ming Ruins.”</p><p>“Our goal this time is not just the Ran Ming Ruins…” Xu Xiaoshou thought. He smiled and didn’t mention anything. He didn’t want to dampen Elder Han’s enthusiasm.</p><p>“Let’s go in!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou used the Puppet Manipulation Thread technique to randomly choose a lucky participant below.</p><p>It didn’t control the other party, but it left an undetectable spiritual thread in his body.</p><p>After the cultivator entered the Four Symbols Secret Realm, Xu Xiaoshou could read out the space node in its location.</p><p>It was quite novel to become a stowaway for the first time.</p><p>His peers were still below, checking the authenticity of the identity jade card under the gaze of the Holy Palace Trial officers and equipment. Then, they entered the secret realm through the teleportation channel.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s fingernails drew across the void as he stepped into the crack with a smile.</p><p>He was a trial-taker as well. He also had an identity jade token and a rather long name. “Xiao Wanfeng, hurry up and come to the east to find me!”</p><p>It was just that those rewards that belonged to the champion of the capital’s trial should all be with Xu Xiaoji. He did not know where they went now.</p><p>Even if Xu Xiaoji really came, Xu Xiaoshou wouldn’t dare to use it.</p><p>After all, the jade token had been confirmed to be the Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou himself. Whoever used it would die.</p><p>MO MO followed closely behind and stepped into the spatial crack.</p><p>It wasn’t her first time traveling through space fragments, so she had already become calm.</p><p>After the spatial crack closed.</p><p>Subsequently, after a long period, a handsome man with a red robe casually draped over his shoulders jumped down from Gong Yang Mountain’s Antelope</p><p>Peak.</p><p>His eyes were long and slightly narrowed.</p><p>He held two illusory blue crescent moons with Saint Inscriptions revolving on them.</p><p>“The17th batch of stowaways. Looks like this is not mine…”</p><p>He landed near the spatial crack that Xu Xiaoshou had entered.</p><p>After pausing for a long time, he gently sniffed. A light flashed in his eyes and he revealed a satisfied smile. “The smell of a ghost beast…”</p><p>“Looks like this is my prey!”</p><p>Yue Gongli seemed to have sensed something. He stopped analyzing the scent and looked up at the sky.</p><p>The world in front of him seemed to have turned scarlet.</p><p>He blinked and felt that the orange and black duo he saw just now was just an illusion.</p><p>He tried hard to recall, but he couldn’t remember anything.</p><p>“Interesting!”</p><p>Yue Gongli twirled the illusory blue moon on his hands with his fingertips, then Dressed his fingers against his forehead and said to himself.</p><p>“Is this the ability of the Blood World Pearl?”</p><p>“Am I cursed?”</p><p>Black Tortoise Range.</p><p>On the 72-storey Black Tortoise Golden Pagoda.</p><p>A burly man with a full beard was hugging his legs and resting his chin on his knees. He was curled up and looking ahead.</p><p>This was the first time the new Combat Division Chief had participated in such a high-intensity mission as the “Heavenly Group Operation”. He looked very nervous.</p><p>Even though his eyes were already dry, he did not blink, afraid that he would miss some important information.</p><p>“Array eye no. 365, red-clothed leader, in position.”</p><p>“Array eye no. 484, white-clothed Hong Jing, in position.” “Array eye no. 7, white-clothed Zhao Chang, in position.”</p><p>“Azure Dragon Range, Ao Sheng, in position.” “White Tiger Range, Xi, in position.”</p><p>“Vermilion Bird Range, Yu Zhiwen, in position.”</p><p>The Heavenly Group’s exclusive battle communicator kept ringing with various notifications.</p><p>For both the red-clothed and white-clothed, even if they were team leaders or vice-leaders of small teams in various places outside. Here, they would only be able to report and not hear anything else.</p><p>The chiefs of the six divisions were different. They could hear the red-clothed, white-clothed, and the six divisions reporting to each other.</p><p>There might be another level above?</p><p>Was that the voice of everyone that the Second Master, the Three Emperors, and the Four Divine Emissaries could hear?</p><p>Perhaps there were more?</p><p>Fangfang did not know.</p><p>He only knew that this “so-and-so in position” was a rigid rule set by Hallmaster Dao.</p><p>Everyone had to report the time regularly, just in case.</p><p>It was said that Xu Xiaoshou had all kinds of strange abilities that could manipulate other people’s minds and possess others. He was simply the embodiment of the evil god ot the Southern Region.</p><p>Fangfang was still quite afraid of Saint Servant Lord Shou.</p><p>He felt that the quieter the surroundings were, the more his fear would be magnified. Hence, he tried to find a conversation and asked,</p><p>“Senior Dachui, why do we need two people to guard this place when everyone else only has one person to guard each spot?”</p><p>“I don’t know! But if you insist on calling me that, wouldn’t it be better to call me Senior Wang or Senior Wang Dachui?”</p><p>Wang Dachui was squeezed into the corner of the Black Tortoise Golden Pagoda. He looked at the solid meatball that was curled up into a ball. The more he looked at it, the more disgusted he felt. He scolded,</p><p>“You only have muscles and no brain. You kept asking questions about everything. Can’t you think for yourself?”</p><p>Fangfang’s palms were covered in sweat. He scratched his head and guessed,</p><p>“Could it be…The probability of Lord Shou appearing here is relatively high. Hallmaster Dao wants the two of us to defend together in case we are instantly killed and can’t even report to the higher up?”</p><p>“Shut your jinx. Your tone makes me want to vomit!” Wang Dachui retched.</p><p>Fangfang had been here for a long time and was already used to Wang Dachui’s “scolding is spoiling” style of speaking.</p><p>He wriggled his waist and turned around, blinking his eyes curiously.</p><p>“Dachui, uh, Senior Wang, I heard that you’ve seen that Lord Shou before and even beat him up?”</p><p>“How strong is he? Does he also have three heads and six arms, just like that Asura Path’s The Divine?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
