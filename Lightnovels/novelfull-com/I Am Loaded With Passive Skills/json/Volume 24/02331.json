He was physically and mentally exhausted, and he felt like a storm was coming.</p><p>He even took the time to ask the other directors of Three Incenses, and he also got similar answers.</p><p>The killers under their respective directors received all kinds of intelligence reports, including Saint Servants and the appearance of other dark factions in the five regions.</p><p>Even the traces of ghost beasts became an active topic in the Central Region!</p><p>“Have I fallen into the Second World of the Ancient Swordsmen…”</p><p>Director Zhou was at a loss. In the room on the second floor of the Three Incenses’s headquarters, he felt that the world had changed in an instant.</p><p>In just half a day, with the news of the Saint Servants as the leader, the pressure brought by the various dark factions entering the city almost crushed him!</p><p>“Beep.”</p><p>The communicator in his hand rang again. Director Zhou lowered his head listlessly. After seeing who it was, he picked up the call. After a long pause, he began to greet,</p><p>“Director Zhao.”</p><p>“To make a long story short, I won’t stand on ceremony with you.” The voice on the other side was very serious. “A gold hunting token killer I’m in charge of also reported that he saw the Saint Servant Lord Shou at He Ting Mountain.”</p><p>Even a gold hunting token killer had come out… “So, everything we encountered is true?” Director Zhou pondered.</p><p>“Yes, 90% is true! Report it, Old Zhou. This isn’t something that can be taken down. Even the white-clothed people won’t be able to handle it. The entire Holy Divine Palace has to go all out.”</p><p>Director Zhou was silent for a while. “May I ask which one of your subordinates sent the message?”</p><p>“This is a little against the rules,” Old Zhao refused.</p><p>“You know that there are priorities. If it weren’t for the special circumstances, I wouldn’t have asked,” Director Zhou didn’t give up. If anything happened to the report, someone would have to take responsibility. He had to decide who he could push the blame to.</p><p>The sound of the communicator continued for a long time before Director Zhao sighed and said the name,</p><p>“Double Dumba*s.”</p><p>“Divine Secret is too f*cking disgusting!”</p><p>Only when he was truly hiding behind the scenes and playing the role of the black hand that stirred up trouble did Xu Xiaoshou understand the true meaning of the Divine Secret.</p><p>As for the evaluation of the “Unpredictable and Unfathomable Dao Qiongcang” , he had a new interpretation.</p><p>“The power that a Divine Sorcerer can display on the battlefield is not even one ten-thousandth of what he can display behind the scenes!”</p><p>Who in the world could break the Divine Art hidden behind the scenes?</p><p>As long as they were not at the same level, they would not be able to understand how abnormal this ability was!</p><p>Not to mention anything else, just Three Incenses…</p><p>With so many people reporting it, the Three Incenses were completely dumbfounded. The higher-ups were all fooled.</p><p>And the final straw that broke the camel’s back was Double Dumba*s’s involvement. This was also why the Three Incenses believed the information reported by their subordinates without a doubt.</p><p>Higher voids!</p><p>Gold hunting token!</p><p>Double Dumba*s’s status in Three Incenses was too high. It was not something that the guy on Abyss Island, who could only flee in a sorry state, could compare to.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t control the gold hunting token killers even if he came in person, so he could only “dissolve” one of them to stir up trouble. After all, he had been dead for a long time.</p><p>It was just that Xu Xiaoshou did not know what intelligence the Saint Temple had in the Jade Capital City. Otherwise, if he manipulated some of its internal members to report it, the foreign division would be in a terrible state and temporarily paralyzed.</p><p>Even so, the information that had been sent up in Three Incenses was enough for Holy Divine Palace to digest for a while, whether it was to formulate countermeasures or to verify the authenticity of the information.</p><p>To Xu Xiaoshou, this was just a small matter that could be done by his second true body while he was sitting in Yougui Pavilion.</p><p>Divine Secret was so terrifying!</p><p>“I succeeded…”</p><p>“This time, the news about the Saint Servants and the various underground organizations entering the Central Region of the Jade Capital City will definitely suppress all intelligence.”</p><p>“In comparison, Xu Gusheng of the Eastern Region is insignificant.”</p><p>“It’s a pity that I didn’t get too much information about the Holy Divine Palace’s actions against me. I only know about the Heavenly Group’s plan and Lord Li…”</p><p>Jin Ren knew when to stop.</p><p>Soon, he turned into the sickly young master Xu Gusheng and left the underground black market with the two girls of Yougui Pavilion who had been waiting in the room in Three Incenses.</p><p>He didn’t need to use the teleportation portal to leave Three Incenses. He stepped on the Space Dao Disc and returned to the grocery store. Then, he swaggered out of the door in front of the grocery store owner without being noticed.</p><p>Even Old Man Li had to wait for Jin Ren to greet him before he seemed to have noticed this person’s existence.</p><p>Holy Emperor Level o Stealth was a little too powerful.</p><p>As long as one did not take the initiative to show off, there would be no such person in the world when walking on the streets. As for Yingying and Qiao’er…</p><p>The two women are just accessories on this trip.</p><p>If they were interrogated later, they would be the best witnesses.</p><p>Of course, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t forget the most important thing. Their memories had been completely altered by Greedy the Cat Spirit’s Three Loathing Eyes..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
