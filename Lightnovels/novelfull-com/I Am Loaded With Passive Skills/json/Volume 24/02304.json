There’s a high chance that it won’t be a matter of whether you can keep the Ultimate Giant under control, but rather that if you can’t maintain it for even an instant. You’ll be drained of your strength and pass out!”</p><p>“But what if I use the Breathing Technique and Feast to devour the enemy’s huge energy in advance, and then use it to transform?” Xu Xiaoshou felt that he and Jin Ren were like good and evil and had a debate in his mind.</p><p>“Boss…” Jin Ren’s legs trembled. “Stop calling and come over.”</p><p>“I’m not the enemy…”</p><p>“Come over!”</p><p>Jin Ren was probably in despair. His body swayed twice, and his eyes lost their focus. He found the space node of the Apricot Realm and entered with a long sigh.</p><p>He did not require any instructions from the main body and the Saint Seeds on All Five Fingers automatically lit up in his hand…</p><p>“All of you, retreat!” The Dragon Apricot Tree could not help but speak up</p><p>“Oh.” Xu Xiaoshou glanced at it and brought Jin Ren to the edge of the world.</p><p>Oh great, this place was barren. In the future, it would be a good place to test one’s skills!</p><p>In the distance, the Dragon Apricot Spirit craned its neck to watch.</p><p>It was unhappy that the Lord of the Apricot Realm did such explosive research in its world, but after all, the Apricot Realm was shared by a human and a dragon, so it could not say anything.</p><p>Moreover, the Dragon Apricot Spirit was really curious as to how far this human kid could go with his Sovereign Dao Realm cultivation level.</p><p>“Is one enough?” Jin Ren raised the Saint Seeds on All Five Fingers in his hand and asked, “I’ve tried my best.”</p><p>“You really deserve to die. Is this considered your best?” Xu Xiaoshou laughed mockingly as he took out ten Saint Seeds on All Five Fingers and threw them out.</p><p>Jin Ren did not have the endurance of a Holy Emperor, so he couldn’t produce that much energy in a short period of time.</p><p>But the main body could.</p><p>The original body’s 10 Saint Seeds on All Five Fingers flew out, and Jin Ren trembled as he activated the Feast and swallowed all the energy.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit’s eyelids twitched.</p><p>This was a game of killing and being willing to be killed. Were all humans so abnormal?</p><p>After he swallowed the boundless energy, Jin Ren’s body cracked and his eyeballs almost flew out.</p><p>He quickly condensed the incomplete Saint Seeds on All Five Fingers and spat out as much energy as possible.</p><p>There were more than ten destructive beams!</p><p>“Boom boom…”</p><p>It was as if a natural disaster had broken out at the edge of the world. Even the Dragon Apricot Spirit and Greedy the Cat Spirit, who were far away in the center, felt the tremors of a great earthquake.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, the Breathing Technique and the Feast emerged together.</p><p>In one gulp, he swallowed the energy that could destroy half of the world.</p><p>His transformation was instantly activated and turned the massive energy into his own.</p><p>Even so, Xu Xiaoshou still felt that he needed an outlet to vent.</p><p>“Moment of Enlightenment! ”</p><p>Without any further ado, he activated the second awakening and entered the state of spiritual contact that allowed him to view the world.</p><p>Only then did he feel better.</p><p>The energy in his body depleted rapidly, but there was still a surplus!</p><p>“It’s really possible. The energy has not been exhausted…” His thoughts changed after he activated the Moment of Enlightenment. Xu Xiaoshou flew into the sky in a rage and turned into the Berserk Giant.</p><p>He paused.</p><p>Even from afar, the Dragon Apricot Spirit felt that something big was about to happen.</p><p>As expected, the golden giant roared again. But this time, it did not lose its sanity!</p><p>“Extreme! Limit! Golden! Giant!”</p><p>With a boom, the Nine Heavens darkened again.</p><p>The giant blotted out the sun that rose in the sky. It was as if a heavenly ancestor had descended into the world; it was unparalleled in the world.</p><p>This was the second time the Dragon Apricot Spirit had witnessed this, but it still felt its heart palpitate.</p><p>The Ultimate Giant’s eyes were bloodshot as he raised his fist. The Dragon Apricot Spirit hurriedly protected the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer. But this time, the heavy punch did not land.</p><p>The Ultimate Giant clapped his hands in the air and caused the space to explode and the air currents to surge forth. He then roared towards the sky as it activated the Swallow the Mountains and Rivers.</p><p>“There had never been a prodigy like me in a hundred generations. It’s rare for a master to appear in ten thousand years!”</p><p>One breath…</p><p>Two breaths…</p><p>Three breaths!</p><p>After a full three breaths, the Ultimate Giant’s body sizzled and emitted a large amount of heat, and his eyes lost their luster.</p><p>Under the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, Xu Xiaoshou left the giant’s shell and walked over.</p><p>His skin was wrinkled and red, and he looked dispirited. However, his eyes were full of vigor and excitement. “Senior, how was it?”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit fell silent.</p><p>This human kid was a little crazy, but he really did it!</p><p>In that state, the fact that he could clearly shout out what he had just said proved that he was conscious and could control his own strength.</p><p>If he could control that power for three breaths of time…</p><p>This was no longer the Sovereign Dao Realm.</p><p>This human kid was a monster who could kill a Saint even though he was only at the Sovereign Dao Realm.</p><p>For the Shengshen Continent, whether these three breaths were long or short, and what kind of stories or accidents would happen during this time…</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit seemed to be able to imagine it.</p><p>It was not just pretense.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not just want to show off his combat strength after he broke through in front of the Dragon Apricot Spirit.</p><p>He threw the dragon corpse in front of the Dragon Apricot Spirit. Without saying anything else, he easily gathered 99 Dragon Apricot fruits.</p><p>This time, the Dragon Apricot Spirit did not even express any objection. It cut down the fruits very happily!</p><p>No one would treat you well for no reason..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
