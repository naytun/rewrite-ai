He waved his paper fan and said, “I have another question.”</p><p>“Gulp, gulp, gulp…”</p><p>Director Zhou didn’t dare to brush this matter off so easily. After he downed another three cups of wine, he said solemnly. “Young Master Xu, do you have any orders?”</p><p>The sickly young master looked at the fatty’s slightly red cheeks, as if his conceit had suddenly risen. His expression became extremely satisfied, but he said indifferently.</p><p>“I just want to know if the Holy Divine Palace is really that stupid. They don’t even know that Xu Xiaoshou had arrived at the Central Region.”</p><p>“Or perhaps, Hallmaster Dao already knew about it and had started to make a plan…”</p><p>After a pause, Xu Xiaoshou revealed the true purpose of this trip very naturally.</p><p>“I don’t want us to collide with our own people when we take action and be used by Xu Xiaoshou and cause both sides to suffer.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is best at this. Did you know that?”</p><p>How could Director Zhou not know how powerful Saint Servant Lord Shou was and how good he was at playing with people’s hearts?</p><p>He stood up and said solemnly.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, please wait for a few moments. If the information is… since</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already arrived in the Central Region, Hallmaster Dao must have known about it!”</p><p>“I’ll go and ask the higher-ups about the arrangements for this matter. It’s impossible for us to bump into each other. You don’t have to worry about this.”</p><p>“As for Young Master Xu’s safety…” Director Zhou patted his chest and promised earnestly, “With me around, it will definitely be guaranteed!”</p><p>I’ll rely on you then, Mr. Intelligence… Xu Xiaoshou nodded slightly and pointed his paper fan at the door.</p><p>Director Zhou bowed and left. He opened the door and left.</p><p>Obviously, his partner Xu Gusheng was not fully aware of his ability.</p><p>What he didn’t know was that when the door opened and closed, he wasn’t the only one who had left. Jin Ren had left as well.</p><p>In the room, Xu Xiaoshou, who had sent away his second true body, sat on the bench and stretched lazily. He could finally breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p>Jin Ren returned to the Yougui Pavilion.</p><p>Now, he was really alone.</p><p>However, in the eyes of the Three Incenses and Director Zhou, Xu Gusheng was always protected by a guard who was at least a candidate for the Seven Sword Deity. This fact would never change.</p><p>In fact, after that, the commotion became bigger and caused more things to happen.</p><p>No one in the Central Region dared to touch Xu Gusheng, even if the sickly young master looked weak.</p><p>The second true body Jin Ren could be completely liberated.</p><p>This was the true power of the Vanishing Technique-it could never be used in battle.</p><p>This was also the key to the guard Jin Ren’s ability to split himself into two and use the ‘presence’ and ‘absence’ ability of the Space Dao Disc.</p><p>The second true body did not have the awakened skill of the second true body. This was the most fundamental difference between him and the main body.</p><p>But now, Xu Xiaoshou had created a second true body for the second true body through his own ability-a person who did not exist.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was willing to call this move the ‘Third True Body’.</p><p>However…</p><p>“Director Zhou seemed very sure. Why?”</p><p>“How would Dao Qiongcang know that I’m here the moment I arrived in the Central Region? Is he really that awesome?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sat on the wooden bench and pondered. There was no one around for a long time.</p><p>He recalled Director Zhou’s actions earlier and smiled. He also threw a pole in the air in the room.</p><p>I don’t want to think about it. Now that the long line has been cast, what fish would come up?</p><p>He looked forward to it.</p><p>It was noon, and it was cold in the Jade Capital.</p><p>Outside the grocery store, in front of the osmanthus carriage.</p><p>Old Man Li leaned on the horse and held a sauce-flavored meat pie in his hand. His mouth was oily and he would occasionally clutch his thin clothes.</p><p>“What kind of weather is this? It suddenly just turned cold…”</p><p>People came and went, and it had nothing to do with him.</p><p>Old Man Li wiped the oil off his hands after he swallowed the last mouthful of the sauce-flavored meat pie. He chuckled and took out a black bag that had cloud patterns embroidered on it from his pocket and opened it.</p><p>Counting money was, of course, one of the happiest moments in life.</p><p>After he counted the Spirit Crystals, Old Man Li naturally read the information on the note made of spiritual source in the small space amid the black bag with the cloud patterns.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is at He Ting Mountain.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was clearly at the Three Incenses!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou must have been kicked in the head by a donkey for him to go to He Ting Mountain!</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou had said so. It meant that if Xu Xiaoshou appeared in He Ting Mountain, then the overall situation would be successful.</p><p>“Lord Shou has arrived. Chaos has arrived…”</p><p>After he sighed silently, he put the Spirit Crystals back into the bag. The small note turned into spiritual energy and was swallowed by the black bag with the cloud patterns.</p><p>All traces disappeared.</p><p>Old Man Li leaned against the carriage and looked up at the sun. His hands clutched the black bag with the cloud patterns tightly, as if he held on to happiness. He started to grin.</p><p>“Lord Shou, is this the first mission that Fugui received after he joined the First Pavilion in the Sky?”</p><p>The Yougui Pavilion, private room on the third floor.</p><p>In the warm bed, Aunt Xiang slept on her side in a tulle nightgown. Her figure was slim and alluring.</p><p>For some reason, a small crack appeared in the spiritual array of the private room. Wisps of green smoke slowly seeped in from the outside, but it did not cause any reaction from the spiritual array.</p><p>In the end, the green smoke turned into the figure of a tall man who sat beside the tea table silently.</p><p>He just sat and watched.</p><p>After a full quarter of an hour, Aunt Xiang still hadn’t noticed!</p><p>The man couldn’t sit still anymore. He rushed over, ripped apart the green gauze curtain, and glared at the beauty on the bed.</p><p>“The sun is already shining on your butt. Why are you still sleeping?”</p><p>“Get up and cause some trouble!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
