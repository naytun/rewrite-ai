The high platform was created from this, and the blue and white background looked extremely grand.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, one could even see array patterns and the divine path patterns drawn on the surrounding wood and stones.</p><p>It was obvious that there was an exclusive protective spiritual array here, that also had a hint of the Divine Secret, just in case it was needed.</p><p>In the sky around the high platform, within the Path Principles that only few people could sense, there were actually the auras of many hidden Holy Palace protectors.</p><p>For the announcement of this trial, the Holy Palace had made ample preparations in advance.</p><p>Under the Golden Osmanthus Sculpture, Hua Ying sat cross-legged on her alchemy cauldron.</p><p>The cauldron was covered with a lid and there were a lot of restless activity inside it. Those who didn’t know better would think that it was conducting alchemy, but in fact, it was filled with some people.</p><p>“How lively…”</p><p>The last time she had seen such a lively place was at the Yunlun Mountain Range in Dongtianwang City.</p><p>Of course, the quality of the trial-takers in the Imperial City Trial back then could not be mentioned in the same breath as the ones present now.</p><p>After all, the geniuses in front of her had only taken the first place, or the top few, or even the top dozens from the various royal cities of the five regions.</p><p>Even so…</p><p>“I wonder if I can find a suitable disciple to take over this time.” Hua Ying was very distressed.</p><p>She came with a mission.</p><p>In order to pass down the Infernal lineage so it could flourish, they had to search for the best seedlings in the five regions every year, whether through the Holy Palace Trial or through other channels.</p><p>An Innate Level Physique that could withstand the Infernal Fire Seed and also excel in all other aspects. This was truly rare.</p><p>It was very likely that it would take decades to find this kind of seedling.</p><p>Therefore, in the second year after Hua Ying became a disciple, she had already started to look for a disciple, but she had not found one yet.</p><p>It was also because the Infernal lineage’s method of selecting successors was too special that the selection of the Holy Palace Trial seemed a little extreme.</p><p>The trial-taker had to be at the Innate Stage cultivation level!</p><p>Even the Master Stage Heavenly Image State would not do.</p><p>Those at the Master Stage could normally withstand the damages from the Infernal Fire Seed without losing their lives or being crippled.</p><p>From this, one could see how domineering the Infernal lineage was.</p><p>If it were anyone else, they probably wouldn’t be able to last a year under the verbal and written criticism of the geniuses of the five regions.</p><p>The Infernal lineage turned a deaf ear to the criticism.</p><p>The rules set by one of the five great authorities of the Holy Palace were set in stone. You either followed the rules of the game or scram.</p><p>That was all that was to it.</p><p>During the early-stage of the rules, the average combat strength of the trial-takers in the Holy Palace Trial were indeed weak.</p><p>However, it didn’t take long for the strong rules to force out some extreme perverts.</p><p>Occasionally, there would be situations where an Innate Stage fought against a Master Stage, fought against a Sovereign Stage or even killed a Sovereign Stage expert.</p><p>How many talents were there in the five regions?</p><p>And now, there was someone who had figured out the path of Spiritual Cultivation, that was to first have an Enlightenment before he made a breakthrough. He could have easily broken through to the Master Stage or Sovereign Stage, but he still suppressed his cultivation level.</p><p>On the other hand, some people increased their combat strength step by step and honed their Innate Stage and kept a low profile first. After they accumulated their strength, they would cross realms to kill their enemies and shock the world with a single brilliant feat…</p><p>There was no difference between the various Spiritual Cultivation techniques.</p><p>The Holy Palace looked at the world from the perspective of development and were afraid to miss out on any genius.</p><p>They only looked at the level and potential of the Spiritual Cultivator, as well as the depth of their understanding of the word ‘Spiritual Cultivation’</p><p>This method of nurturing geniuses was the fundamental reason why the Holy Palace’s free development of forms and styles flourished.</p><p>The Five Great Inheritances of the Holy Palace were eternal, and the Four Disciples of the Holy Palace were the best proof.</p><p>“However, this generation is a little ordinary…”</p><p>Hua Ying looked at the geniuses of the five regions who surrounded the high platform and felt that the good and bad were mixed together.</p><p>Among them, the one that the world had the highest evaluation of was actually nothing in her eyes.</p><p>In the end, it was because she had met her martial uncle Xu Xiaoshou on her journey to the Yunlun Mountain Range in the Eastern Region.</p><p>To put it bluntly, Hua Ying believed that only a monster like her Uncle-Master Xu Xiaoshou could become the successor of the Infernal lineage and was qualified to be her disciple.</p><p>However, if she were to compare the current generation against the standards of Uncle Master Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>“When will I ever find the one?” Hua Ying had a headache. She could only hope that a dark horse would emerge from this group.</p><p>While she pondered over it, the person in charge of the Golden Phoenix Square reported respectfully, “Hua Ying Saint’s Envoy, it’s time.”</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Hua Ying shouted and jumped down from the top as she held the lid of the alchemy cauldron that was filled with momentum.</p><p>“I want you all to quieten down!”</p><p>She turned around and viciously kicked the alchemy cauldron. After she issued a warning, she realized that her voice had been amplified across the entire square through the spiritual array.</p><p>The restless square instantly fell silent.</p><p>Countless gazes were fixed on the valiant woman under the Golden Osmanthus Sculpture, their eyes filled with shock.</p><p>Wasn’t this Holy Palace envoy a little too overbearing?</p><p>“She’s Hua Ying?”</p><p>“I heard that she is from the Infernal lineage. No wonder she has such a bad temper. Saint Servant Lord Shou seemed to be her uncle-master…”</p><p>“Shh! You’d better not talk nonsense. The lineage of the Sleeveless Saint Servant had already been judged by the Holy Palace.”</p><p>“That’s still been passed down from generation to generation. Lord Shou even dared to kill Sword Deity Rao. I can already feel her power and I’m satisfied.”</p><p>Hua Ying felt rather awkward.</p><p>She had only wanted to teach those restless people captured at the He Ting Mountain a lesson. She did not expect that the spiritual array would amplify the sound..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
