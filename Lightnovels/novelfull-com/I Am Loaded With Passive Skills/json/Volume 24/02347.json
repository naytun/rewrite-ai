Clearly, they were prepared to welcome the guests.</p><p>At Gong Yang Mountain, they would have fun for a month.</p><p>After the disciples came out, if they had any grudges, they would be counted separately.</p><p>However, all these preparations were interrupted by the sudden calamity cloud and thunder.</p><p>Descending from the sky…</p><p>Seeping out from the sudden spatial crack in the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>“A demi-saint’s aura?!”</p><p>The elites of the various large factions looked up with fear in their eyes.</p><p>Even though they were inexperienced- they had heard of the so-called “sanctification” after living for so many years.</p><p>The scenery of Gong Yang Mountain was exactly the moment of sanctification that had not appeared in the Shengshen Continent for a long time.</p><p>“Holy Palace’s envoy! May I ask what’s going on?”</p><p>“How can someone go through their sanctification in the Four Symbols Secret Realm? How can we proceed with the trial?”</p><p>Someone hurriedly looked at the Holy Palace’s envoy, Hua Ying, who had arrived late. Then, they pointed at the entrance of the Four Symbols Secret Realm that had just disappeared, and their brows were burning with anger.</p><p>Wasn’t this the same as giving it away for free?</p><p>They were just a group of innate rookies. If they were affected by the saint calamity at such a close distance, they would die without a burial place!</p><p>Hua Ying was also stunned. She looked at the heavenly saint calamity with a dazed expression.</p><p>She was just an envoy of the Holy Palace, not a know-it-all.</p><p>How could she have known that someone would be going through their sanctification right after passing through the spatial passageway of the Four Symbols Secret Realm?</p><p>It couldn’t be that…</p><p>“Someone suppressed their innate stage so much that they broke free and entered the demi-saint stage?” Hua Ying suggested.</p><p>“This is ridiculous!”</p><p>“I know what kind of talent the children of my clan have. If they can do this, why would they come to Gong Yang Mountain? We would have opened a secret training realm ourselves!”</p><p>The crowd exploded.</p><p>Some people seized the time to avoid being locked on by the saint calamity.</p><p>The staff of the Holy Palace also began to evacuate the crowd, sending everyone out of the area covered by the saint calamity.</p><p>Hua Ying carried her alchemy cauldron. She felt that her thoughts were likely to be true.</p><p>Such commoners had no idea what a true genius was.</p><p>Perhaps a peerless dark horse was being born in the Four Symbols Secret Realm?</p><p>For example, if Uncle Xu entered the Four Symbols Secret Realm, he might be able to do so.</p><p>Gong Yang Mountain, is a land of miracles!</p><p>Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>Not long after Wei An left Saint Hall, he received many messages.</p><p>Most of the messages were normal, talking about how the sky was falling.</p><p>However, there was also a message that said,</p><p>“Uncle Wei, we might be picking up a treasure. A cultivator is going through sanctification right after they enter the Four Symbols Secret Realm.”</p><p>Bullsh*t! What did she mean by a trial-taker having their sanctification right now!</p><p>Wei An almost couldn’t hold back his anxiety and wanted to send a message back to scold the sender.</p><p>However, when he saw that the person who sent the message was the troublemaker of the current generation of the Infernal lineage, he suddenly understood why such a message existed.</p><p>Although the brains of the Infernal lineage had been burned by the white flames, they were always able to produce geniuses. It was not surprising that they could have such thoughts.</p><p>Wei An turned around and vented his anger on the Sacred Mountain.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, is this what you meant by giving it your all?”</p><p>“The trial has just begun. Not only do you want to destroy our people, but you also want to destroy the entire Four Symbols Secret Realm, right?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang, who was sitting on the main seat in the Saint Hall, stroked his communicator and looked at the chessboard in front of him. He held a piece in his hand and listened to all the reports from the members of the Heavenly</p><p>Group calmly. Then, he answered and instructed them in an orderly manner. Only then did he look up.</p><p>“Calm down.”</p><p>“Alright.” Wei An was able to calm down. After taking a seat, he saw that the hallmaster was still in the mood to play chess, and his anger grew. “Tell me, what’s the situation now?”</p><p>“As you can see, Saint Servant’s Cen Qiaofu has appeared in front of the Black Tortoise Golden Pagoda and started his sanctification.”</p><p>“…How do you plan to deal with it?” Wei An asked after he resisted the urge to punch the old flamboyant Elder Dao in the head.</p><p>“Divine secret…” Dao Qiongcang looked up and wanted to say that subconsciously. However, he paused when he saw Wei An’s anger and said, “Should not be revealed.”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Wei An stood up, and the chair behind him exploded into dust.</p><p>He had a good temper, but that didn’t mean he didn’t have one.</p><p>The tables and chairs in the huge Saint Hall shook in anger.</p><p>Under the suppression of the Holy Energy, even the black cloth on Ai Cangsheng’s thigh started to ripple.</p><p>However, this was the Saint Hall, the meeting hall of Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe. It dealt with all the big and small matters in the five regions.</p><p>No matter how strong the demi-saint’s aura was, it couldn’t crush the pillars in the hall or the Divine Array.</p><p>The roots of the Saint Hall did not move at all, they were even more stable than Dao Qiongcang’s hand.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang only listened to Wei An quietly. He smiled and pursed his lips, not giving any additional explanation.</p><p>Wei An took a deep look at him and let out a long breath. In the end, he chose to believe him.</p><p>“You’d better, you’ve better calculated everything…” He turned around and left, disappearing in one step.</p><p>“Will he attack?” Ai Cangsheng looked into the distance, his eyes calm.</p><p>“No, he’s only going to protect the cultivators of his Holy Palace.. How can he be of use to me?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
