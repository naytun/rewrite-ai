He Ting was the former headquarters of Fen Qin…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou’s first Master was Sleeveless the Saint Servant, who was also one of the Five Evil Guys, Fen Qin Zhu He…”</p><p>“He took his gang and went to He Ting. What was he looking for?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou watched Director Zhou’s expression change. The word ‘Suspected’ kept popping up in the Information Bar. He grabbed the fan and smiled.</p><p>He didn’t need to do much. He only needed to write down the words ‘He Ting’. With Director Zhou’s ‘intelligence and wisdom’ , he could easily come up with numerous things.</p><p>This was how one was misled by being too smart.</p><p>If it had been Mu Zixi and the others, Xu Xiaoshou would never have dared to use this move to deal with them.</p><p>He Ting Mountain was originally just a place where the sad story told by Aunt</p><p>Xiang took place. Now it had become an important part of Xu Xiaoshou’s plan.</p><p>He set aside the personal discussion and thought from the perspective of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>Where was the most likely place that Xu Xiaoshou would go to when he came to the Central Region?</p><p>He Ting Mountain!</p><p>Why would he go to He Ting Mountain?</p><p>His Master Sleeveless who was also Fen Qin Zhu He must have left something there. Even if the huge Fen Qin had been destroyed for more than sixteen years, there must be some semblances of the ashes of his desires left. Only the people with the Infernal lineage could detect the traces.</p><p>Was it possible that Xu Xiaoshou did not go to He Ting Mountain and did not even know who Fen Qin Zhu He was or where He Ting Mountain was located?</p><p>The answer was yes, it was possible!</p><p>From the perspective of the Holy Divine Palace, how could a smart person like Sleeveless the Saint Servant not think that if he allowed his disciple go to the He Ting Mountain, it would incur some risks?</p><p>Therefore, it was possible that he had never told Xu Xiaoshou some secrets.</p><p>However, from Dao Qiongcang’s personal point of view, it did not matter if the Sleeveless Saint Servant had said anything. He had to defend He Ting Mountain!</p><p>“I can catch nothing and set up defenses for sixteen years in vain. It doesn’t matter.”</p><p>“But I can’t let Xu Xiaoshou go to He Ting Mountain one day and get something there or restart Fen Qin. I can’t let him leave that easily.”</p><p>This was the only answer that Xu Xiaoshou could get after he put himself in Hallmaster Dao’s shoes.</p><p>He believed that regardless whether he knew about He Ting Mountain or not, as the former site of the Fen Qin, Hallmaster Dao would not stop his surveillance there.</p><p>Since Xu Xiaoshou was bound to appear in He Ting…</p><p>After Abyss Island, Xu Xiaoshou would definitely become the core of the Saint Servant and cause trouble in the Central Region.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was happy to tie these two events together and let them occur at the same time.</p><p>At the very least, this way, all the forces of the Holy Divine Palace would not be concentrated in the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>This was still an open scheme. No matter how Dao Qiongcang thought about it, he had no choice but to accept it.</p><p>“Although it’s better than nothing…” After all, the Holy Divine Palace did not lack the manpower. Xu Xiaoshou knew this.</p><p>The room fell silent for a moment.</p><p>Director Zhou’s thoughts were all over the place. When he looked at the water marks on the tea table that had completely disappeared, he was instantly in a dilemma.</p><p>He wanted to further confirm with the guard Jin Ren what exactly happened when he met Lord Shou at He Ting Mountain.</p><p>This wasn’t purely because he didn’t trust the information.</p><p>It was more about how the legendary Saint Servant Lord Shou came and went and killed people without being detected; and how Jin Ren managed to uncover Lord Shout s disguise and escape safely.</p><p>However, Director Zhou was even more afraid to ask something he should not ask…</p><p>He had been in this position for many years.</p><p>He had been a killer for more than thirty years, but after he was freed, he had retired and was still able to get the position of director at the Three Incenses.</p><p>Director Zhou cherished life very much.</p><p>He also knew how to cherish his own life.</p><p>Otherwise, he wouldn’t be at the Three Incenses at this moment. He was biased towards Xu Gusheng and even wanted to be the middleman between Xu Gusheng and the Three Incenses.</p><p>This was equivalent to training another gold hunting token killer… No!</p><p>Xu Gusheng together with his guard Jin Ren were much stronger than a gold hunting token killer!</p><p>It was also because of this that Director Zhou knew that sometimes, too much knowledge might seem helpful for the present, but it would not be beneficial for the future.</p><p>He was very smart and knew that he should not ask at this time, so he stared at the tea table and hesitated.</p><p>He was very cunning. He knew that Xu Gusheng was a smart person and should know what was on his mind.</p><p>Xu Gusheng would naturally say it if he could.</p><p>He couldn’t say it. In a moment, he would change the topic and let this matter pass. Everyone would be fine.</p><p>“Stop pretending!”</p><p>Sure enough, Xu Gusheng sneered and mocked. “We’ve already divided our interests. It’s not good for either of us to hide anything!”</p><p>His sarcastic tone sounded so cordial at the moment-he chose to say it because he thought of him as one of his own.</p><p>However, Director Zhou still let out a surprised ‘ah’ and then looked up in confusion.</p><p>He knew that big shots could say that, but if a low-level person like him took it seriously, he would give the impression that he was too simple and silly.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, what are you talking about?”</p><p>“You’re still keeping up the pretense!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth twitched. He could easily tell that Director Zhou pretended to be confused.</p><p>However, he was more than willing to entertain this kind of pretense at being confused. Then later, he would use the most superficial way to explain everything.</p><p>“Didn’t you just want to ask about the specific process?”</p><p>“With such a cowardly attitude, how are you going to work for me in the future?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
