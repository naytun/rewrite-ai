But Bazhun’an, the first-in-command saint servant, didn’t do that.</p><p>His integrity had been trusted by everyone for decades.</p><p>On the Sky City, with a wave of his hand, those who survived until the end were all sent out to the outside world. Bazhun’an didn’t care about what they did or what they gained.</p><p>Whether you entered the game or not was your choice.</p><p>Whether you lived or died was your destiny.</p><p>As for what you could achieve inside and bring out in the end, it was all up to the individual.</p><p>This was the way of the ancient swordsman! Everyone was willing to play like this!</p><p>The battle for the path belonged to the battle for the path, but at least there</p><p>was no need to fear being held accountable after snatching someone else’s</p><p>opportunity.</p><p>In this regard, Dao Qiongcang’s reputation couldn’t compare to Bazhun’an’s. The former was unscrupulous, while the latter precisely controlled the bottom line of principles.</p><p>As long as one didn’t cross the line, even discussing matters with Bazhun’an shoulder-to-shoulder was highly possible.</p><p>There was a joke in the streets that if Dao Qiongcang set his sights on you, you could dodge him on the first day, but by the fifteenth, you were bound to die.</p><p>But if Bazhun’an set his eyes on you, you could just throw your weapon at his feet, and you would live.</p><p>Bazhun’an didn’t kill the unarmed.</p><p>Of course, this was a joke, and the exception was “excluding ancient swordsmen.”</p><p>The faster an ancient swordsman threw their sword, the faster they died— there couldn’t exist an ancient swordsman without backbone in the world.</p><p>Rumors in Jade Capital City spread wildly.</p><p>In just half a day, some people’s ears had calloused from hearing too much.</p><p>Some went back and forth to He Ting Mountain several times but didn’t find the inheritance, while others were eyeing the Four Symbols Secret Realm…</p><p>Some claimed to have received the information three days ago, while others said the news had been circulating for half a month.</p><p>Moreover, some had been preparing for the Ran Ming ruins for more than a year, holding a key to open the Ran Ming ruins called the “God -Slaying Token.” The Transformation Division was the first to receive these rumors.</p><p>But when rumors spread from Jade Capital City to the entire Central Region and even to the five domains of the continent, the Transformation Division couldn’t suppress them anymore.</p><p>Undoubtedly, Saint Servant was making a move and a strong one at that.</p><p>When the newly appointed Chief of the Transformation Division, Xi, received the news that the situation was uncontrollable, it was half a day after the first rumor surfaced.</p><p>He utilized all the power at his disposal.</p><p>However, the Transformation Division was ultimately just one of the Six Divisions under the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>Saint Servant came prepared.</p><p>Their information warfare inherited the excellent tradition of Fen Qin and never lost to any faction or power in the world, even the Holy Divine Palace. Of course, this was also due to the fact that they spread rumors faster than anyone could debunk them.</p><p>“Bloody chaos!”</p><p>“I’m starting to believe that the Ran Ming ruins are about to appear.”</p><p>“Gather three God-Slaying Tokens, summon the god slayer, entrust the</p><p>inheritance to me, and everyone can enjoy the treasures…”</p><p>“Holding the demon cleaver, wielding the God -Slaying Token, joining the twin axes, dominating the world as one…”</p><p>“The fall of the Holy Palace, the rise of Saint Servant, the return of the four seas, the balance of all things…”</p><p>In the Transformation Division, someone, while looking at endless data, marveled as if in a trance, “Is this really information from half a day ago? Why does it feel like I’ve heard all of this six months ago?”</p><p>“And there’s something even more absurd! To verify the authenticity of Xu</p><p>Xiaoshou from the Ting Mountain and the power of the Infernal lineage, the Southern Region, in just one day, has stirred up a fervor for Lord Shou, even overshadowing Bazhun’an. They say…”</p><p>“What do they say?”</p><p>“Uh, they say… the unparalleled Xu Xiaoshou, not a single clone can escape Lord Shou’s power. His incarnations number in the tens of thousands, making it difficult to distinguish between good and evil.”</p><p>“Pfft!” Someone spurted out their tea as they were sipping.</p><p>“His incarnations numbers in the tens of thousands—who came up with that?</p><p>It’s absurd! I’m starting to suspect every ancient swordsman I see is Xu Xiaoshou. I can’t stand this anymore.”</p><p>“Me too.”</p><p>“Same here…”</p><p>“I’ve dealt with too many Xu Xiaoshou lately. I dream of Xu Xiaoshou, and when I wake up, there are two in my bed, only to realize it’s a dream within a dream…”</p><p>“I don’t know who spread these rumors, but there are only a few intelligence agencies in the Southern Region. You know what, there’s something even more absurd!”</p><p>“Tell me, tell me!”</p><p>“This describes the combat strength of Lord Shou, combined with his tortuous experiences. Ahem, listen carefully… ‘The Four Disciples of the Holy Palace nurture extraordinary talents. Not even the Eighth of the Inner Yard can compare. Cut through thirteen generations of the five regions and dare to open the gates of the Nine Serenities!”‘</p><p>After this statement, the entire Transformation Division fell silent, and it took a while for someone to mutter.</p><p>“Outrageous.” “Extremely outrageous!”</p><p>“As I see it…”</p><p>“Enough.” Xi, who seemed to have been forgotten in the shadows, appeared at some point, “Have you all forgotten the important matter?”</p><p>The Transformation Division immediately fell silent, each returning to their duties.</p><p>“Cut through thirteen generations of the five regions and dare to open the gates of the Nine Serenities…” Xi reprimanded his subordinates but murmured to himself silently.</p><p>Having been involved in intelligence work for so long, he knew that these exaggerated pieces of information were the easiest to spread..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
