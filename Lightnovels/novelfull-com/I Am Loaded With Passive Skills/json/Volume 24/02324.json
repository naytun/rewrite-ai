I will be informed to let you in.”</p><p>“In case of danger, crush this talisman. The power of the Apricot Realm will directly guide you inside. Remember not to resist.”</p><p>Little White Ferret nodded quizzically as he tried to make sense of the information.</p><p>It didn’t boast, nor did it think its Super Saint Escape Technique was invincible.</p><p>Lord Shou must have considered everything in advance when giving these things, so blindly accepting it was the way to go.</p><p>Aunt Xiang peered at the jade talisman and asked, “What is the Apricot Realm?</p><p>Do I get a jade talisman too?”</p><p>“The Apricot Realm is my small world, originally a Yuan Mansion.” Xu Xiaoshou had long prepared many jade talismans leading to the Apricot Realm, which would be distributed to the people of the First Pavilion in the Sky in the future.</p><p>He looked at Aunt Xiang and asked, “Are you going on this journey?”</p><p>“Yes,” Aunt Xiang said, looking prideful as she twirled her long hair with her slender fingers, “I am your last line of defense, but you must protect me and try not to expose me.”</p><p>Wouldn’t the Summoning Technique be the last line of defense?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou silently muttered to himself and handed over a jade talisman.</p><p>Aunt Xiang really couldn’t afford to be exposed.</p><p>Once she was exposed and her ties to the Saint Servant revealed, it would be the end of Yougui Pavilion.</p><p>In Xu Xiaoshou’s anticipation, this matter could even be handed over directly to the First Pavilion in the Sky, with Aunt Xiang remaining outside.</p><p>He was about to speak when Aunt Xiang interjected, “Let’s set off in a day. No rush.”</p><p>“Why?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>Aunt Xiang lightly tapped the table with her fingers, gazing out the window with a hint of worry in her eyes. “After all, he is Elder Dao the Flamboyant…”</p><p>“Do you feel you will be exposed?” Xu Xiaoshou chuckled. “Actually, you don’t have to go.”</p><p>“No, I have to go, even if we’ll be exposed as soon as we enter,” Aunt Xiang couldn’t muster a smile. “Only the Ten High Nobles can challenge the Ten High Nobles.” “Then why wait for a day? What difference does a day make?”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>“What’s the reason?”</p><p>“After a day…” Aunt Xiang’s enchanting eyes glinted with confidence as she turned her gaze:</p><p>“I’ll make the entire Jade Capital City tremble as news of the emergence of Ran Ming ruins spreads far and wide!”</p><p>“At that time, countless stowaways eager for opportunities will follow us and enter the Four Symbols Secret Realm in advance!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered for a moment, then exclaimed in realization, “So even if you’re exposed, you’ll just be one of the stowaways, not necessarily a companion of the Saint Servant, even if the Holy Divine Palace knows?”</p><p>“Exactly, treasures go to those destined for them. The Saint Servant can compete for them, and I, Xiang Yaoyao, have nothing to fear,” Aunt Xiang proudly raised her chest, already planning her retreat.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was secretly amazed, recalling the punch of The Divine in his mind.</p><p>Indeed.</p><p>The Saint Servant had Bazhun’an, Water Ghost, and the various ghost beasts of Inner Island…so they didn’t fear the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>With ‘At the Gates of Hell, even The Divine is revered!’ behind her, Aunt Xiang could defy the world! She truly had a way.</p><p>“Tap.</p><p>Aunt Xiang placed a jade scroll on the table and rose from her seat:</p><p>“It’s settled then. A day later, we’ll head to the Four Symbols Secret Realm along with all the stowaways.”</p><p>“Take a look at this thing first. Perhaps what’s recorded inside is the opponent we will face next.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou picked up the jade scroll and asked, “What is this?”</p><p>Aunt Xiang walked towards the door, “The new Council of Ten, the new Six Divisions, and ‘Heavenly Group’ led by Elder Dao the Flamboyant, specifically targeting the Saint Servant..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
