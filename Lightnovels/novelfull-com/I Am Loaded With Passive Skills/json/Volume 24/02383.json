What was there to fear?</p><p>“Form the array!”</p><p>Cheng Huan roared, and everyone snapped back to attention.</p><p>Sixteen Higher Voids, thirty-four Cutting Path Stage cultivators, and one hundred and sixty-two Sovereign Dao Realm cultivators instantly fell into formation once again, creating the “Hundred Stars Pure Qi Array.”</p><p>“A good array.”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu couldn’t understand the Divine Array.</p><p>But he could distinctly feel that the collective strength of those present had coalesced into a formidable defense.</p><p>This array was meant to buy time, to wait for the support of the demi-saints…</p><p>And with his Pan Xian Ax losing the power of saint calamity, he feared that even if he exerted all his strength, he wouldn’t be able to break through the defense of such a great array.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu smirked.</p><p>He had never thought of confronting the Divine Array from Dao Qiongcang alone.</p><p>The saint calamity was his companion in battle.</p><p>“Kids, you can start to fear now!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu let out a laugh, and above his head, a demi-saint person appeared, causing a thunderous roar to reverberate through heaven and earth.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>On Gong Yang Mountain, calamity clouds gathered once more.</p><p>Near the cliff of the Black Water Stream, the sense of calamity spread like water.</p><p>The red and white-clothed people who had just formed the Hundred Stars Pure Qi Array immediately understood Cen Qiaofu’s intentions—he was going to undergo sanctification again!</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Cheng Huan screamed in horror.</p><p>This Saint Servant Cen Qiaofu was going to transcend the tribulation again, making the Hundred Stars Pure Qi Array they had just formed become nothing more than a plaything for the saint calamity before everyone’s eyes! How dared he?</p><p>He had just failed to transcend the tribulation, yet he hadn’t suffered any damage?</p><p>“Quick, retreat!”</p><p>Cheng Huan urged again, and everyone gradually withdrew while maintaining the formation.</p><p>However, Cen Qiaofu frowned.</p><p>Why did the sound of the saint calamity sound different this time?</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The void exploded.</p><p>This time, the rumble was even more violent.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s pupils suddenly contracted, and he raised his head in shock.</p><p>On the high cliff, the red and white-clothed people forming the array also sensed something and looked up.</p><p>Above, a shooting star streaked across the sky, leaving behind a dazzling trail of black and red brilliance.</p><p>The Arrow of Evil Sin Bow, piercing through the sky from Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, slashes through the heavens and earth, penetrating extradimensional space and radiating a blazing light across the sky.</p><p>Just like the arrow that shot towards Sang Qiye in the Eighth Palace, crossing two domains, it aimed straight for Cen Qiaofu’s head. An unmatched arrow, sealing the fate of eternity.</p><p>“Ai Cangsheng!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s scalp tingled, his spirit frozen, feeling as if he were being stared at by the god of death.</p><p>This was just after his saint calamity had ended, the beginning of a new tribulation, when he was at his weakest.</p><p>This arrow from Ai Cangsheng didn’t even give him half a chance.</p><p>Its timing was too precise!</p><p>Its angle was too cunning, impossible to evade!</p><p>“The arrow of Lord Cangsheng, from the Evil Sin Bow…”</p><p>“The Three Emperors have made their moves! This is the Shengshen Continent, not the Sky City. Under the gaze of Lord Cangsheng, how dare a mere mortal act recklessly?”</p><p>“Haha, Cen Qiaofu, your death is imminent!”</p><p>Under the Hundred Stars Pure Qi Array, the red and white-clothed people felt like they had been hit by a bolt of happiness amidst Cen Qiaofu’s horror.</p><p>All their fear of the battle and the saint calamity vanished under this arrow of salvation.</p><p>They were too stunned by Xu Xiaoshou’s explosion.</p><p>They were too ensnared by the Gray Fog Hand.</p><p>At this moment, the red and white-clothed people finally remembered…</p><p>The Shengshen Continent belonged to the Holy Divine Palace!</p><p>Ai Cangsheng of the Three Emperors was the last line of defense protecting this land!</p><p>The five regions were too vast for any individual to explore in a lifetime, yet they were also small enough that even the farthest corners were within the range of Lord Cangsheng’s arrow.</p><p>For beings like the Saint Servant, who were only fit to lurk in the dark corners like mice, once exposed to the light, it meant their demise.</p><p>“Pan Xian Ax, Return to the Origin of Heaven and Earth!”</p><p>“Pan Xian Ax, Yin Yang Splitting Dawn!”</p><p>“Pan Xian Ax, The Beginning of Chaos!”</p><p>As the arrow came straight for him, a sense of death gripped Cen Qiaofu’s spirit, causing his entire body to tremble uncontrollably.</p><p>But he didn’t give up. One swing after another of his Pan Xian Ax, in the initial gathering of the saint calamity, before the Arrow of Evil Sin Bow burst forth, he frantically attacked.</p><p>“Bang! Bang! Bang!”</p><p>One explosion after another echoed in the dim sky.</p><p>Under the power of the saint calamity, the Pan Xian Ax could break through the Cang God Armor, and split the Beast Path, but when faced with the Arrow of Evil Sin Bow, it couldn’t even stop it from falling!</p><p>“Ai! Gang! Sheng—”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s eyes were bloodshot. He roared, yet found himself powerless.</p><p>The nine supreme divine weapons, when in the hands of the higher void-level experts, could unleash only a fraction of their power; in the hands of a demi-saint, they were divine instruments of world destruction.</p><p>Moreover, the compatibility between the Evil Sin Bow and Lord Cangsheng was so high that it almost surpassed the limit.</p><p>“Swallow!”</p><p>As the final arrow approached, Cen Qiaofu dared not attempt to counterattack. Instead, he threw out the Corner of Divine Prison.</p><p>This was his trump card, a divine object meant to suppress the saint calamity. It shot out nine blue chains, effortlessly wrapping around and swallowing the Arrow of Evil Sin Bow.</p><p>“Eh…” Inside the Hundred Stars Pure Qi Array, hundreds of red and white-clothed people were stunned.</p><p>The Arrow of Evil Sin Bow was gone… just like that?</p><p>It was swallowed so casually, ridiculously, and shamefully?</p><p>Then, what remained next would be only them, facing Cen Qiaofu’s fury and the saint calamity.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>On the other side, Cen Qiaofu watched as the Corner of Divine Prison became dull and ineffective, feeling his heart bleed.</p><p>To use such an artifact of a Holy Emperor to swallow a single Arrow of Evil Sin Bow was simply wasteful!</p><p>This was an object that could withstand even a blow from the Wangze Holy Emperor!</p><p>But now, there was no other way. His life was the most important.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu quickly crushed a sword talisman and sent a message to Bazhun’an.</p><p>While stimulating the power of his demi-saint person, he prayed for Ai Cangsheng to slow down a bit, or for the City of the Dead Bodhisattva to speed up a bit, to delay the arrival of this unstoppable Lord Cangsheng.</p><p>Just one moment!</p><p>In one moment, the peak of the saint calamity would be forcibly reached!</p><p>By then, even if the arrows of the Evil Sin Bow were unleashed in rapid succession, they would be useless. The saint calamity could crush them all…</p><p>“Bang! Bang! Bang!”</p><p>Three explosions sounded in the sky.</p><p>Before the thunder of calamity struck, three black lights carrying blazing flames descended.</p><p>“Ah, this…”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu looked up, his eyes losing their light.</p><p>His tense body suddenly relaxed, and the hand holding the Pan Xian Ax became limp..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
