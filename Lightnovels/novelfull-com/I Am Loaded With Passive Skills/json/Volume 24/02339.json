I will be the one who will host the upcoming Holy Palace Trial.” The man in the white robe who hovered in the air had a pleasant expression.</p><p>He didn’t mention anything about what had just happened.</p><p>Everyone seemed to have forgotten about the chaos just now. They only waited respectfully, each of them shocked.</p><p>Wei An!</p><p>He was the previous director of the Holy Palace Saint lineage.</p><p>His age and status were similar to Mu Ling’s, but he had attained sanctification ten years earlier.</p><p>His protective nature, peaceful personality, humility, righteous heart and gentlemanly demeanor made him a great representative of the Holy Palace.</p><p>“Uncle Wei…” Hua Ying raised her eyes to look at him, then she silently lowered her head and walked back.</p><p>Since Wei An was here, then there would no longer be a problem.</p><p>“I didn’t expect that I could mess up such a small announcement before the trial and even needed Uncle Wei to clean it up…”</p><p>Hua Ying was furious!</p><p>She wished she could catch hold of Xu Gusheng and refine him, but she didn’t dare to do anything reckless now.</p><p>The last time she refined some people was at Four-hill mountain. At that time she only relieved them of their qi- no one died in the process.</p><p>But Uncle Wei happened to bump into her!</p><p>Uncle then told her kindly that this kind of behavior was not suitable and was bad for her image as a lady.</p><p>When she returned, her Supreme Master Bai Lan flew into a rage. He banished her into the forbidden grounds to reflect on her deeds for a month as punishment.</p><p>Hua Ying didn’t know what happened in between, nor did she dare to ask. Wei An looked down from above, but his expression was serene and as refreshing as the spring breeze and autumn rain. He did not exert any pressure on the young people below. Instead he spoke softly.</p><p>“The Holy Palace Trial will be held at the Gong Yang Mountain located at the Four Symbols Secret Realm. It will last for a month and will be based on points.”</p><p>“The Four Symbols Secret Realm is divided into four lineages. They are the Azure Dragon lineage, the White Tiger lineage, the Vermilion Bird lineage, and the Black Tortoise lineage.”</p><p>“Among these four lineages, there is a special species called ‘deviant ghosts’.</p><p>The trial-takers must obtain points by killing these deviant ghosts.”</p><p>“These deviant ghosts are divided into six levels: Deviant Ghosts, Deviant</p><p>Ghost Yamas, White-faced Deviant Ghosts, also known as the initial White-faced, Profound White-faced, Extreme White-faced, and finally the</p><p>Red-faced.”</p><p>“For level six deviant ghosts, their strength correspond to the Innate Stage, the Master Stage, the Sovereign Dao Realm, the Cutting Path and the higher void and variant higher void. The corresponding points are one, ten, one hundred, one thousand, ten thousand, and one hundred thousand.”</p><p>“Apart from this, there is a golden pagoda located in each of the four lineages. The trial-takers can also obtain points when they try to climb the pagoda, but it would be more difficult. You can enter the secret realm to understand the specific rules.”</p><p>“That’s about it.”</p><p>As soon as they heard what Wei An said, the Golden Phoenix Square finally broke into a clamor.</p><p>Level-six deviant ghosts could at most correspond to the higher void and the mutated higher void. How could they battle them?</p><p>Even the geniuses of the five regions who were about to participate in the trial looked very unhappy.</p><p>Those who could come to the square were at most at the Innate Stage.</p><p>How could an Innate Stage fight against a higher void?</p><p>Or go and fight against the so-called mutated higher void?</p><p>It was no longer a question of whether they could win or not, but whether they could survive!</p><p>“I can see that everyone has a lot of questions. You can ask any questions you want.”</p><p>Wei An looked down and saw fear, nervousness, anticipation, excitement…</p><p>However, the rules set by the Holy Palace were announced by a demi-saint. Who dared to ask questions?</p><p>Wei An turned to look at the brave young master who was covered in fruit juice outside the square.</p><p>“Young friend, do you have any questions?”</p><p>Everyone turned to look at the same time.</p><p>Even Hua Ying looked over and knew that Uncle Wei helped her to vent her anger.</p><p>This was the gaze of a demi-saint!</p><p>Let’s see if you can take it!</p><p>“+(Questioned, Passive Points)+l.” “+(Watched, Passive Points,+) +9999.” “+(Expected, Passive Points,+) +9999.”</p><p>Wow! Thank you, big boss, for the reward!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s health was instantly revived.</p><p>“I have a question!”</p><p>“Please speak.”</p><p>“Demi-saint Wei An, what is a mutated higher void? Is it a hybrid between a human and a deviant ghost? Or did you cross breed with some other beast?” The sickly young master’s eyes were filled with pure curiosity.</p><p>The representatives of the various major factions on the Golden Phoenix Square gasped, as if they sensed something hidden in his question.</p><p>However, after they saw the sickly young master’s serious gaze, they felt that they were probably being too sensitive.</p><p>“This brat…” Hua Ying felt bewildered. Was Xu Gusheng not afraid of a demi-saint at all? What was his background?</p><p>“No.” Wei An’s eyes were also filled with surprise. He replied this young man’s daring question. “The mutated higher void only meant that the strength of those with the red faces exceeded the ordinary higher void. They also have other strange abilities.”</p><p>“Where did these strange abilities come from?” The sickly young master asked again.</p><p>“It came from the secret realm.” “Are there many of them?”</p><p>“Not much.”</p><p>“Is there any connection between the mutated higher void and the imminent appearance of the Ran Ming ruins? Were they affected by the radiation of the power of the ancestral source? Will the deviant ghosts become stronger than usual and would this affect the safety of the trial-takers?”</p><p>The sickly young master was full of questions. He always had the safety of the trial-takers in his mind, as if he was the demi-saint of the Holy Palace who cared about the talents of the world.</p><p>“+(Lauded, Passive Points+) +8595.”</p><p>“+(Praised, Passive Points, +) +6226..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
