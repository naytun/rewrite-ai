When the two ladies from the Yougui Pavilion rushed over to help him, he stood up again.</p><p>Jin Ren who remained hidden had long taken advantage of the chaos to extend his vicious behind-the-scenes Black Hand tactics and used them to manipulate everything.</p><p>He was like an elegant pianist as he indulged himself in the disappearing world that no one could see. His fingertips skimmed lightly over the keys like dragonflies on the water.</p><p>“Apologize!”</p><p>Outside the square, a burly man suddenly stood up and said righteously.</p><p>“What did Young Master Xu do wrong? Why did the Holy Palace envoy hurt him?”</p><p>“You hurt someone, yet you just turned around and left. You didn’t even offer him a basic apology?”</p><p>The people around him were stunned.</p><p>They turned around and saw that it was the sixth elder of the Hongtian Sect, Zhao Yizheng.</p><p>This person was usually chivalrous and aware of his limits. How could he be that stubborn today?</p><p>In the presence of tens of thousands of people, he wanted the Holy Palace envoy to apologize to a passerby? “Elder Zhao, why are you doing this? Don’t scare me…”</p><p>“Sit down please, elder Zhao!”</p><p>“Old Zhao, what are you doing!”</p><p>The people close to the Hongtian Sect found themselves in a dilemma. Panic-stricken, they tugged at Zhao Yizheng’s sleeve and wanted to pull him back to his seat.</p><p>Who knew that elder Zhao, who was at the Cutting Path cultivation level would swat away the hand of the person beside him. He even turned around angrily and berated him.</p><p>“Justice is on the line here, yet none of you are willing to stand up for it.”</p><p>“In broad daylight, the word ‘justice’ is in front of me. I’m ashamed to be associated with you all!”</p><p>He flicked his sleeves, flew up into the clouds and disappeared.</p><p>“He, he left?”</p><p>This unforeseen event had frightened too many people.</p><p>At the Holy Palace Trial venue, a rather famous Cutting Path expert had left in anger due to the injustice encountered.</p><p>If this got out, would the Holy Palace have any dignity left?</p><p>“Why did this happen?”</p><p>Hua Ying was puzzled and her face darkened.</p><p>She turned around and saw the remaining members of the Hongtian Sect whose faces had turned ashen. They looked at each other with fear in their eyes.</p><p>It was as if they were afraid that she would deal with them in the same way she used her cauldron to blast Xu Gusheng away.</p><p>“I won’t attack you!”</p><p>“What elder Zhao said was indeed very reasonable!”</p><p>Hua Ying almost vomited blood, but she could only wail silently in her heart.</p><p>For others, it was very difficult to apologize. She felt that elder Zhao was very loyal. He was right and she could apologize.</p><p>However, just as she was about to apologize.</p><p>On the other side, another Cutting Path stood up and said angrily.</p><p>“I think Young Master Xu’s words were quite reasonable. Why would the Holy Palace envoy want to hurt people?”</p><p>“Could it be that what he said hit a sore spot? The Ran Ming ruins is about to make an appearance and the Holy Palace doesn’t have the ability to guarantee the safety of the trial-takers in the Four Symbols Secret Realm. Instead, they still insisted on doing things their own way?”</p><p>Everyone gasped and turned to look.</p><p>It was the Green Dharma Sect…</p><p>In this sect, only their sect master was a higher void, right?</p><p>The person who spoke was the guardian of the Green Dharma Sect, Xiao Kun?</p><p>How could he dare to speak? Xiao Kun was just a Cutting Path and he still dared to disrespect the Holy Palace?</p><p>Before the group of people from the Holy Palace and even Hua Ying could respond, the Chief Elder of the Green Dharma Sect trembled and stood up. He slapped Xiao Kun so hard that he fell to the ground from the impact of the blow.</p><p>“What nonsense are you spouting now!”</p><p>He almost couldn’t speak. His tongue seemed to be tied in knots.</p><p>After he cursed, the Chief Elder turned around and trembled as he met the gazes of tens of thousands of people in the Golden Phoenix Square.</p><p>At this moment, he felt as if the sky had collapsed. There was nothing darker than what was in front of him now.</p><p>Like a broken bone, the Chief Elder of the Green Dharma Sect bowed at an angle of 90 degrees toward the center of the high platform for the sake of the sect’s longevity. In a trembling voice, he said.</p><p>“Envoy of the Holy Palace, our guardian Xiao often falls ill.”</p><p>“He always says things that don’t make sense. It’s the same this time. Please don’t take it to heart.”</p><p>Hua Ying closed her eyes and sighed.</p><p>She felt that the scene was quite strange. The people from the Holy Palace were already investigating, so she had to stall them.</p><p>She did not take guardian Xiao Kun’s words to heart, so she said, “I don’t mind it. ”</p><p>“That’s good…” The Chief Elder’s body relaxed.</p><p>“Why is the Green Dharma Sect who was so arrogant initially so respectful now? Is it because you’re afraid that the Holy Palace will seek revenge later?” A voice suddenly sounded from somewhere.</p><p>In the Golden Phoenix Square, one could hear the sound of a pin drop.</p><p>Hua Ying almost picked up the alchemy cauldron and threw it at that particular spot.</p><p>However, the Chief Elder of the Green Dharma Sect seemed to have been provoked. He suddenly stood up and looked up. His eyes gleamed brightly as he raised his head and thrust his chest out. He then roared.</p><p>“What did guardian Xiao do wrong?”</p><p>“This old man has endured for a lifetime, I can’t endure it any longer!”</p><p>“Holy Palace envoy, please respond directly. Can you protect the Four Symbols Secret Realm trial-takers at the Ran Ming ruins…”</p><p>Swish!</p><p>The Chief Elder disappeared halfway through his speech.</p><p>At the same time, Jin Ren who stayed hidden in the disappearing world and who was immersed in the drama performance suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p>“There’s a big Boss here?”</p><p>He hurriedly severed the spiritual threads hidden in the bodies of the Chief Elder, guardian Xiao, and the others because he suddenly had palpitations.</p><p>It was a sudden whim!</p><p>A middle-aged man dressed in white suddenly appeared in the sky above the Golden Phoenix Square.</p><p>Everyone looked up and saw the man dressed in white who had an ethereal look about him. His eyes were calm and there was a faint glow around his body.</p><p>He was like a saint who had descended from the heavens and gave off a feeling of peace and tranquility.</p><p>As soon as he descended, his momentum had already suppressed the chaos in the square. Everyone only had this one person in their eyes and no longer had any other thoughts.</p><p>“Demi-Saint!”</p><p>After Jin Ren recognized the Holy Power, he was shocked and realized that things had gotten out of hand..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
