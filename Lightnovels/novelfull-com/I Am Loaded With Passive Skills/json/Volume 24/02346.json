It’s all because of my luck that I didn’t die!”</p><p>Wang Dachui was mumbling something, but Fangfang couldn’t understand a single word of his language.</p><p>A clear voice came from the communicator again.</p><p>“Azure Dragon Range, Ao Sheng, in position.”</p><p>“Array eye no. 1, Ao Sheng’s clone, in place. The first God-Slaying Token has been inserted into one of the three memorial tablets in the Ran Ming Ruins…What was the meaning of the sudden notification of ‘searching for the location of the second God-Slaying Token’? A female voice? Am I not the only one here? There are still people alive?”</p><p>There was a hint of nervousness in his voice, which could be heard from the continuous questions.</p><p>“Vermilion Bird Range, Yu Zhiwen, in position. That is the ‘God-searching array’ of Hallmaster Dao. It is searching for the location of the God-Slaying Token in the Four Symbols Secret Realm. It is not a living person, so there is no need to worry.”</p><p>“Azure Dragon Range, I am Ao Sheng. Why is it such an enchanting female voice? Isn’t this scaring people…isn’t there another God-Slaying Token? What if it finds ours?”</p><p>“Vermilion Bird Range, Yu Zhiwen, in position. The other one is outside. Yes, it could be…Xu Xiaoshou’s position.”</p><p>So fast? They were already searching for the location of the Saint Servant?</p><p>Fang Fang, who huddled himself on the Black Tortoise Golden Pagoda, heard this and quickly interjected,</p><p>“Black Tortoise Range, Fangfang, in position.”</p><p>Wang Dachui’s bird language was interrupted for a moment before he hurriedly followed up, “Black Tortoise Range, Wang Dachui, in…”</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>In front of the Black Tortoise Golden Pagoda, a spatial crack torn by a blunt weapon appeared, and an old man in black jumped in.</p><p>Wang Dachui was stunned.</p><p>Fangfang was also stunned.</p><p>So ostentatious?</p><p>The stowaways nowadays didn’t even bother to hide their identities. They just came in right in front of the chiefs of the six divisions?</p><p>Who were they looking down on!</p><p>“Yo, there’s someone…Wang Dachui? Long time no see!”</p><p>The old man’s hair was already white, but his eyes were vibrant and bright. His face was a little dirty, making it difficult for people to recognize him.</p><p>He didn’t have any extra accessories on him. He only had a dead branch in his mouth and a small axe at his waist.</p><p>The Dao runes around his body were natural and emitted an aura of returning to simplicity.</p><p>However, the two present could tell that this person was a higher void!</p><p>“Alright, I’ll let you guys witness this. It’s been a long time since I’ve been so ostentatious.” As the old man spoke, he took out a crystal gem from his ring.</p><p>“Black, black, black…”</p><p>Fang Fang was so frightened that he stood up on the top of the tower. He pointed at the old man in front of him with one hand and took out a bundle of bounty sheets that had been crumpled with the other. However, he suddenly stuttered and could not speak.</p><p>“Black Tortoise Range! Cen Qiaofu! Semi-saint person!”</p><p>Wang Dachui’s scalp went numb as he summarized all the key information. His entire body felt cold from the soles of his feet to the top of his head.</p><p>He suddenly pulled out his Thorny Hammer from his back and retreated as if he had encountered a plague.</p><p>“Azure Dragon Range, I’m Ao Sheng. Wang Dachui, what are you talking about? What do you mean by semi-saint person? Hallmaster Dao, can I go over and provide support?”</p><p>“What else could it mean? Sanctification!” Wang Dachui roared,</p><p>“Damn sissy, what are you waiting for?”</p><p>“Damn it, Cen Qiaofu wants to pull a sanctification in front of me. Instead of running away, are you planning to stay in the range of a saint calamity and</p><p>“Come quickly!”</p><p>“There’s a communicator?” Cen Qiaofu touched the Pan Xian Axe at his waist and chuckled. He didn’t mind and closed his eyes.</p><p>At this moment, the transmission channel leading to the inside and outside of the Four Symbols Secret Realm just closed.</p><p>At this moment, all the trial-takers had just entered the secret realm. The so-called trial had yet to begin, and they had not even seen the deviant ghosts.</p><p>The sky rumbled and thunder rumbled.</p><p>Holy Palace Trial, Hell Mode, activated!</p><p>As the world shook, a long sigh that contained an ancient and lonely feeling came from the nine heavens and fell into the ears of every cultivator.</p><p>“A man’s beard ends in the old tree’s spring…”</p><p>“Half a lifetime is wasted, but it’s not lost…” “The sunset in the west mountain is reflected in the multicolored light…”</p><p>“Pan Xian beheaded to honor the Saint…”</p><p>In front of the Black Tortoise Golden Pagoda, Cen Qiaofu slapped the immortal axe on his waist and spat out the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch.</p><p>With a swing of his axe, one of the Nine Great Ancestral Trees, the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch, split into two with a crack sound, unleashing a surging power.</p><p>At the same time, the crystal-like semi-saint level leaped above his head and devoured the power.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s eyes widened, and his voice was like thunder.</p><p>“Dao Integration and sanctification!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
