He knew that when Cen Qiaofu’s saint calamity reached its climax, his saint calamity would be drawn in and he would have to go through it again.</p><p>However, as the Saint Guardian Wei An, he was not afraid.</p><p>Another saint calamity could cause serious injuries or even death to an ordinary demi-saint. Wei An, who had the Guardian Attribute, was not afraid of such things. At most, he would suffer minor injuries and would recover after a few days.</p><p>However, this was the first time Wei An had heard that Yue Gongli could remove the saint calamity’s lockdown with just an array wheel.</p><p>NO!</p><p>This was not the first time.</p><p>Mu Ling seemed to have mentioned that Dao Qiongcang had indeed used a similar method before on Abyss Island.</p><p>so…</p><p>Yue Gongli seemed to be out of tune, so was everything he said true?</p><p>“Senior Dachui!”</p><p>In a corner where he was barely noticed, Fangfang swallowed some elixirs and regained some mobility before he pounced towards Wang Dachui.</p><p>Wang Dachui, who had activated the Beast Path, had turned into a half-human, half-hyena form. His Six Paths were not perfect after all. After being cut in half, he was already on his last breath even though the saint calamity no longer locked onto him.</p><p>His mind drifted between lucid and manic moments.</p><p>“Woo!”</p><p>A low hyena howl came from his throat.</p><p>Fangfang clasped Senior Dachui’s half body and there were tears in his eyes when he raised his head. “Senior Yue Gongli…”</p><p>Yue Gongli stopped laughing and looked down silently. He paused for a while and then said slowly.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Fangfang. There’s nothing I can do.”</p><p>“This is the side effect when one forcibly opens the incomplete Six Paths.</p><p>Whether or not he can recover, or even survive, would depend on his own luck.”</p><p>“You have to know that not everyone can become The Divine.”</p><p>The Divine… Fangfang closed his eyes.</p><p>Of course, he knew about the famous senior who had broken through the barrier between the world of mortals and ghosts. He was the only true inheritor of the ancient martial arts!</p><p>But was Senior Dachui going to give up just like that?</p><p>Fangfang thought of the first thing Senior Dachui did when he rushed back. He didn’t attack Cen Qiaofu, but saved him from the saint calamity…</p><p>“There’s no need to feel guilty.” Yue Gongli said.</p><p>Of course, he knew what Fangfang ‘s thoughts were. He even knew what Wei An was thinking. He said indifferently, “You saved him, so he saved you. So, you don’t owe him anything.”</p><p>Fangfang shook his head and sobbed bitterly.</p><p>At the age of sixteen, he did not care about the sequence of saving people. All he saw was beauty.</p><p>Fangfang wiped away the snot on his beard and smeared it on Senior Dachui’s clothes. He looked expectantly at Senior Wei An who emitted the Saint Guardian light.</p><p>“Senior…”</p><p>“I’m sorry.” Wei An closed his eyes. “I’m a guardian, not a savior. Perhaps the Infernal lineage might have a way.”</p><p>“The traitor of the Infernal lineage is the second in command of the Saint Servant. What method do they have? There is a method that involved the use of poison!”</p><p>Yue Gongli glanced at Fangfang.</p><p>He would never have said that in front of a minor.</p><p>“Yes, the hope is slim, but it will always exist.” Yue Gongli echoed what he said.</p><p>“Yes! Yes!” Fangfang nodded vehemently. His vision was blurry from his tears. He wiped away his tears and snot, took out some elixirs and fed them to Senior Daichui.</p><p>Primordial Dao Elixirs, Spirit Returning Elixirs, Spirit Healing Elixirs… He even took out the Red Gold Pill.</p><p>He had everything except for the two key life-saving items, the Rejuvenation Pill and God’s Blessing. He didn’t even have the Little Rejuvenation Pill.</p><p>Yue Gongli couldn’t stand it anymore. His eyes twitched. “You only have the Master Stage and Innate Stage rank Elixirs?”.</p><p>Fangfang raised his head and his voice became a little weaker. “I, I don’t have money…”</p><p>Yue Gongli almost lost control.</p><p>You are the new Chief of the Combat Division, and you don’t have money?</p><p>If you don’t have money, then the whole world would be poor!</p><p>Moreover, from your feeble personality, you don’t seem like someone who would eat, drink, and gamble away your money?</p><p>“Where are your Spirit Crystals?” Yue Gongli asked.</p><p>Fangfang paused for a moment, hesitated and did not answer.</p><p>“Speak!” Yue Gongli shouted angrily.</p><p>Fangfang trembled in fear. “J, Jade Capital City,” he said in a trembling voice, “There were actually many orphans like me who did not have food to eat.” He found it difficult to say this aloud, as if being an orphan was a taboo subject.</p><p>Wei An was stunned.</p><p>Yue Gongli’s face froze.</p><p>Wei An looked at Yue Gongli.</p><p>Yue Gongli slapped himself hard.</p><p>He flew down from the sky and landed beside Fangfang. He took out a golden pill and stuffed it into Wang Dachui’s mouth.</p><p>“What, what is this?”</p><p>“God’s Blessing..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
