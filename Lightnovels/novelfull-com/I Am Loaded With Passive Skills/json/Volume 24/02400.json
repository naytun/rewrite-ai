It was one of the many powers that human claimed he possessed. Its deep blue eyes grew even more serious.</p><p>At that moment, the human body concealed its sharpness like a sheathed sword.</p><p>Its Thought of the Holy Emperor could only discern a faint aura of the Dragon Ancestor’s power, failing to grasp the magnitude of the present moment.</p><p>Hence, Qilin thought that Xu Xiaoshou must have been joking earlier.</p><p>Little did it know that this individual possessed the capability to unleash combat strength comparable to that of a demi-saint, with intentions to challenge a Holy Emperor.</p><p>“Roar—”</p><p>The Berserk Giant raised his head, emitting a resounding dragon roar.</p><p>The Dragon Ancestor’s power under the Holy Emperor’s “Stealth” state, compared to its fully ignited form, resembled fireflies next to the bright moon—utterly incomparable.</p><p>Just how strong was Xu Xiaoshou? Even he himself couldn’t be certain!</p><p>After the dragon’s roar, the Berserk Giant sprouted a dragon horn, and his entire body was covered in a layer of tough, golden dragon scales.</p><p>The golden force flowed like magma on the scales, adding a touch of nobility and dominance to the golden Berserk Giant.</p><p>—The power of the Dragon Ancestor!</p><p>“Come at me!”</p><p>With such a stance, Xu Xiaoshou boldly launched an attack, throwing a punch.</p><p>Qilin could no longer remain calm.</p><p>Bound within the Four Symbols Secret Realm, it indeed had limited power at its disposal.</p><p>However, this dragon, clad in human skin, foolishly sought to test its strength against it, inviting nothing but inevitable humiliation.</p><p>“Hum!”</p><p>The single horn on its head trembled slightly.</p><p>Upon the black scales of Holy Emperor Qilin, the power of the earth surged.</p><p>Its aura became as heavy as the earth, and its claw gained the hardness of a towering pillar.</p><p>Facing the Berserk Giant of equal size, it launched a punch charged with the power of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>“Hiss—”</p><p>As fist met claw, the world instantly fell silent for a brief moment.</p><p>The explosive sound seemed to surpass the usual frequency, making it impossible to hear anything.</p><p>The Falling Flower World could no longer withstand such power and was easily shattered by the clash of the two forces.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s will was blasted out of the shattered world.</p><p>Yet, the Holy Emperor Qilin’s power of the earth and the power of the Dragon Ancestor were mutually attractive. To retreat even half a step would mean an irreversible outcome.</p><p>“Come at me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his gaze.</p><p>Heart Sword Technique, Demons Under Eyes!</p><p>The moment he tumbled out, he reconnected with the Holy Emperor Qilin’s now clearly visible ‘waves’ of will, swiftly returning to the battle!</p><p>“Boom, boom, boom…”</p><p>The Four Symbols Secret Realm shook violently.</p><p>Outside, the celestial galaxy had shattered, and the real-time influence of the god slayer Ran Ming had reached its lowest point.</p><p>But the abrupt spatial disturbance was no less shocking than the emergence of the Saint War or the ruins of Ran Ming.</p><p>The trial-takers inside the Four Symbols Secret Realm were puzzled, feeling the difficulty of this trial had become incredibly high, as if death could come at any moment.</p><p>On a higher level, they could sense that this sudden fluctuation surpassed the ordinary Saint Warrior, vaguely perceiving the aura of the Holy Emperor’s power and the power of the ancestral source.</p><p>But no matter how everyone speculated or searched, they couldn’t find the source.</p><p>Where did the battle happen? Did it happen at all? Was it within the Four Symbols Secret Realm? None could tell!</p><p>But it undoubtedly affected the Four Symbols Secret Realm!</p><p>The Vermilion Bird Golden Tower.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen, standing atop the Pearl Tower, felt it most deeply.</p><p>She even had a gut feeling that the source of the earlier world tremor came from the position beneath her.</p><p>But scanning around, there was clearly no sign of any battle, nor any trace of the emergence of treasures.</p><p>“Beep… drip.”</p><p>The Heavenly Group’s communication channel went through!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s eyes flickered with joy as if she had found her backbone, hurriedly pressing to connect to the channel.</p><p>She was about to say something when she stopped abruptly.</p><p>Glancing sideways, there was no one behind her. But Yu Zhiwen seemed to have seen something, parting her lips slightly in the breeze.</p><p>She hesitated for a long time, her thoughts swirling, eventually condensing into a single sentence on the channel:</p><p>“The Vermilion Bird Golden Tower, Yu Zhiwen reporting… no abnormalities.”</p><p>On the Pearl Tower, the girl gripping the astrolabe tightly nodded heavily, silently adding:</p><p>“Well, it should be said that there are no significant abnormalities here, but we were affected by the world tremor just now.”</p><p>She didn’t mention this in the Heavenly Group’s communication channel, including her previous “feeling.”</p><p>In the art of Divine Secrets, feelings without evidence were mere conjectures.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s rigorous academic career had given her a principle: only speak with evidence, and never indulge in speculation or suspicion.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou was clearly seen over at the Black Water Stream, where people witnessed him being engulfed by divine light and dragged into the ruins of Ran Ming. How could he appear by your side? Are you going crazy thinking about him?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen patted her chest secretly, calming her nerves.</p><p>Just the thought of voicing that “feeling” and being questioned like this made her face flush with embarrassment.</p><p>If she replied with “No, I truly sensed him, and Xu Xiaoshou indeed possessed invisibility power, so one must be cautious.”</p><p>If someone were to further ask, “You said he has invisibility power, how did you sense him?”</p><p>“I smelled it, his scent…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s starry eyes froze, gazing into the distance, silently murmuring her response.</p><p>She quickly snapped out of it.</p><p>With a swish, her cheeks turned visibly red at an alarming speed, as if blood could drip from her ears.</p><p>“Yu Zhiwen, what are you thinking!”</p><p>The girl on the Pearl Tower reached out, repeatedly slapping her cheeks in high frequency, trying to cool her burning face with the wind.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
