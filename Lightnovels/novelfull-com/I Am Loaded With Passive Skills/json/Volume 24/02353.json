I see Frost Ferret, Xu Xiaoshou, and another woman… she seems familiar. I’ll check.”</p><p>“Array Eye Number One, they’ve stopped above the cliff. I’m currently below Black Water Stream. Hallmaster Dao. Let me challenge them to test the waters!”</p><p>“Vermilion Bird Range, Yu Zhiwen in position. Ao Sheng, please return. Xu</p><p>Xiaoshou isn’t someone you can handle alone.”</p><p>“White Tiger Range, Xi, in position! Ao Sheng’s clone, please wait for reinforcements. Do not attempt to face them alone…”</p><p>“Array Eye Number One, I’m out! Frost Ferret can’t take me down. I wield the power of the Rock Upanishad. I’ll delay them until reinforcements from red and white-clothed people arrive.”</p><p>“White Tiger Range, Xi, in position! Ao Sheng’s clone, please wait…”</p><p>“What was that sound?”</p><p>“Hmm? What’s happened? Was that an explosion?”</p><p>“White Tiger Range, Xi, in position! Everyone, remember to report in before speaking, or it’ll be too chaotic… Array Eye Number One, report in! Array Eye Number One, report in!”</p><p>“Sizzle…” “White Tiger Range, Xi, in position! Speak, Ao Sheng’s clone!”</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>“White Tiger Range, Xi, in position! Ao Sheng, what’s happening? Speak!”</p><p>After these two inquiries, the communication channel of the Heavenly Group fell silent.</p><p>Everyone awaited the words of Ao Sheng’s clone, who had gone out for a “test.” But at this moment, even Ao Sheng himself remained silent.</p><p>On the Azure Dragon Range, atop the Azure Dragon Golden Tower.</p><p>Ao Sheng, the newly appointed Spirit Division Chief, suddenly convulsed. His eyes bulged, veins pulsating on his forehead, and blood spurted from his seven orifices.</p><p>“Ahh!!!”</p><p>Clutching his head, he let out a piercing scream, his body contorting in agony like a boiled shrimp, rolling down from the tower’s peak.</p><p>Crashing thunderously onto the ground, he writhed with his head in his hands, as if suppressing unimaginable pain.</p><p>Despite the heavy breaths, he gritted his teeth, unwilling to release even a hint of a cry, except for that sharp scream earlier.</p><p>But that single scream…</p><p>None in the Heavenly Group’s communication channel were deaf; everyone heard it!</p><p>“White Tiger Range, Xi, in position. Ao Sheng, speak! Did you hear that?” “Vermilion Bird Range, Yu Zhiwen in position. Ao Sheng, are you alright?”</p><p>Beneath the Azure Dragon Golden Tower, Ao Sheng activated his communicator but quickly moved it away. After coughing up blood, he brought it closer.</p><p>His eyes were filled with bloodshot veins, his expression gruesome, yet his tone was oddly calm:</p><p>“Azure Dragon… Range, this is… Ao Sheng.”</p><p>“No major issues… occurred,” he continued, “My dragon clone… well, perished in battle. There are three opponents… cough.”</p><p>The Heavenly Group’s communication channel fell silent once more.</p><p>“White Tiger Range, Xi, in position. Ao Sheng, why is your speech so intermittent?”</p><p>“Vermilion Bird Range, Yu Zhiwen in position. He might have suffered a backlash?”</p><p>“White Tiger Range, Xi, in position. Ao Sheng, don’t force it. You’re currently the only one who has encountered Xu Xiaoshou. Quickly report his information, don’t omit anything.”</p><p>Beneath the Azure Dragon Golden Tower, Ao Sheng wiped the blood from his eyes, gazing into the distant sky with a hint of dread.</p><p>Swallowing hard, he felt better as the elixir’s effects eased his pain. With difficulty, he said:</p><p>“I am Ao Sheng. My clone has fallen in battle.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou used a special technique. There was no spiritual source fluctuation, yet he instantly drained my dragon clone’s power of the Dragon Pearl and energy reserve spiritual source.”</p><p>“He definitely possesses the power to kill a higher void-level being!”</p><p>“Xi! Your Transformation Division’s intelligence is severely lacking. I was nearly killed by your negligence. Without the knowledge of a demi-saint, no one can stop Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“So, how did you die?” Xi’s voice echoed.</p><p>Ao Sheng’s body trembled. “He not only drained my spiritual source but also sucked away my dragon clone… I, I lost control…”</p><p>“And then?” Yu Zhiwen’s voice chimed in.</p><p>“Then…”</p><p>“Ao Sheng, be mindful of what you say now; it concerns the lives of countless people in the Holy Divine Palace.” Xi’s voice grew solemn. “While we regret the sacrifice of your clone, his sacrifice was not in vain. We urgently need the most accurate firsthand information about Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>Ao Sheng stood before the Azure Dragon Golden Tower, silently listening. His gaze was incredibly hollow.</p><p>Gazing into the distance, his mind magnified the image of Xu Xiaoshou’s finger pressing against his forehead.</p><p>His future nightmares would likely revolve around that moment of mental collapse.</p><p>After a brief movement of his lips, Ao Sheng spoke, “Xu Xiaoshou used a single finger…”</p><p>“Did he employ that special spiritual technique capable of killing the soul of God? Or some other Saint Martial Arts, like the Ten Sections of the Finger Sword?” Xi speculated when no further details were given.</p><p>“No.” Ao Sheng suddenly felt irritated. unable to articulate the inexplicable.</p><p>“Ao Sheng! Speak! Was your spirit defeated along with your clone?” Xi’s voice became increasingly intense.</p><p>“Shut up! You’re too noisy!” Ao Sheng roared, “Xu Xiaoshou didn’t use any spiritual technique; he just used a finger!”</p><p>“And then?” Xi also grew angry. Where was the rest of the information? How could someone withhold crucial information after a sacrifice?</p><p>“That’s it!” Ao Sheng’s rage was ready to burst from his eyes, “Damn you…” “Silence!” Hallmaster Dao’s voice abruptly intervened.</p><p>“Xi, stop asking. There might be no further ‘then’,” Yu Zhiwen’s voice rang out simultaneously, as she too realized something..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
