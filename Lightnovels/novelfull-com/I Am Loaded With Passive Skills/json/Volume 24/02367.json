Nevertheless, he telepathically conveyed the seamless details of his plan.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu halted, and turned around, his eyes revealing a hint of curiosity.</p><p>“Why aren’t you running? What’s the holdup?” Yue Gongli chuckled, not through telepathy this time, and the red- and white-clothed people outside the saint calamity also heard.</p><p>“You’re really annoying!” Cen Qiaofu retorted coldly.</p><p>“Merely because I’ve seen through your intentions, and now you can’t bear it? Your actions are too conspicuous. Isn’t your mission to disrupt the Divine Array</p><p>Eye?”</p><p>“What of it? Does it matter?”</p><p>“You’re trying to delay me! You’ve succeeded, but I’m not Wei An. Indeed, I don’t want to face the saint calamity again…” Yue Gongli squinted his eyes, looking up at the sky. “But how long can you keep this up?”</p><p>As the calamity reached its climax, Cen Qiaofu’s responses grew strained, his movements sluggish.</p><p>“You are on the brink of death, just unaware!” Yue Gongli leaped out of the midst of the intense saint calamity and landed above a swamp. His lips curled into a sly smile:</p><p>“Perhaps you intend to make a final struggle after being sanctified, like a trapped beast.”</p><p>“But how do you know that I only have three Divine Array Wheels on me?” Cen Qiaofu was taken aback, his actions visibly stiffened.</p><p>Yue Gongli slipped his hand into his sleeve, neither withdrawing it nor producing another Divine Array Wheel.</p><p>Yue Gongli merely squinted his fox-like eyes, calmly addressing the Old Woodcutter braving the tribulation, “If I were to tell you that, just as you’re about to be sanctified, I’ll cast a Great Shielding Technique on you, sending you back to the higher void, and then make my move against you…”</p><p>“At that time, what will you do?”</p><p>Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>The Heavenly Group’s operational channel was constantly buzzing with updates.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang calmly dealt with each and every message.</p><p>Reports from his Dark Division members had already alerted him to the peculiar situation in the Four Symbols Secret Realm—Yue Gongli was suspected of communicating with Cen Qiaofu, but the content remained unknown.</p><p>“What’s your take on Yue Gongli?” Dao Qiongcang turned to Ai Cangsheng beside him.</p><p>“A vagabond,” Ai Cangsheng replied succinctly.</p><p>“Oh? Does that mean I shouldn’t use him?”</p><p>“Not my call. Don’t impose your decision on me; decide for yourself.”</p><p>“Heh…” Dao Qiongcang chuckled and stopped discussing the matter. Instead, he activated the inter-dimensional Divine Communicator and solemnly conveyed, “Yue Gongli, rumor has it that you’re colluding with a Saint Servant.”</p><p>Yue Gongli, in the Four Symbols Secret Realm, stiffened at once, scanning his surroundings.</p><p>He even released his saint’s will, extending it to all four corners of the land.</p><p>Nothing seemed amiss.</p><p>No one, no divine crafts or beings, was staring at him. Dao Qiongcang’s presence was not present, and the Eyes of the Great Path did not focus on him…</p><p>“Who’s spouting nonsense?” Yue Gongli’s response carried suppressed anger.</p><p>“It’s me,” Dao Qiongcang replied calmly.</p><p>“You</p><p>“I guessed.”</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, have you lost your mind? Making wild guesses here! Tell me, did you plant something near me, or is there an issue with this Divine Communicator in my hand? Just you wait, I’ll crush it right now…”</p><p>“If there was something wrong with it, you would’ve crushed it already. But your response, indeed, raises questions.” Dao Qiongcang was indifferent. “Confess, or do you wish to struggle?”</p><p>“…Elder Dao the Flamboyant, I’m employing tactics!”</p><p>“Then enlighten me. What tactics are you using?”</p><p>“Do you even understand tactics? If I told you, would it still even work?” Yue Gongli sneered. “Just know this: I won’t betray the Saint Servant… No, I mean, the Holy Divine Palace… Hehe, slip of the tongue.”</p><p>Inside the Saint Hall of Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang glanced at the puzzled Ai Cangsheng, who couldn’t hear the conversation. Straightening his back, Dao Qiongcang’s expression turned cold.</p><p>“Slip of the tongue, or straight from the heart?”</p><p>“Heh, Elder Dao the Flamboyant, I was just joking with you. You’re not taking it seriously, are you? You can’t be, right?” Yue Gongli’s transmission carried a tone of exaggerated surprise. “You actually believed it!”</p><p>“You better remember, you’re joking now.” Dao Qiongcang was very serious.</p><p>“Are you warning me?”</p><p>“You could interpret it that way.”</p><p>“Elder Dao, you’ve truly hurt my feelings…”</p><p>Yue Gongli’s voice carried a hint of lament. “I joined the Heavenly Group, at your service, willingly taking a subordinate role, attending to your every need. I was devoted with unwavering loyalty, and what were you doing all this time? You were doubting me!”</p><p>Yue Gongli’s voice grew louder. “Trust those you use, and don’t use those you suspect. Do you understand this principle, Dao Qiongcang?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang remained silent for a while.</p><p>He moved the communicator away and blocked it with Holy Power before turning to Ai Cangsheng with a smile, resuming their interrupted conversation.</p><p>“He told me to trust those I use and not to suspect them.”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng maintained his gaze on the sky, nodding silently without expressing any opinion.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s expression turned solemn again as he brought the communicator closer, saying coldly, “Remember what you just said.”</p><p>“Elder Dao the Flamboyant, I…”</p><p>Yue Gongli was about to launch into a lengthy complaint when Dao Qiongcang interrupted, “Give me a laugh.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“Laugh.”</p><p>There was no response on the other end of the communication device.</p><p>After a moment’s pause, Dao Qiongcang disconnected the communication.</p><p>As he expected, the communicator started vibrating madly, as Yue Gongli repeatedly attempted to reconnect..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
