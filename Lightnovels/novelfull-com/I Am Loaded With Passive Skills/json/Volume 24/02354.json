Hesitating, he responded, “Thirty percent.”</p><p>“Thirty percent? Are you out of your mind, or am I crazy?” Xi couldn’t hold back anymore. What time was it? Why was he still beating around the bush?</p><p>The Heavenly Group’s combat channel fell silent. Surprisingly, there were no angry outbursts of shame from Ao Sheng.</p><p>After a while, a hoarse and low voice weakly sounded:</p><p>“Ninety, ninety percent.”</p><p>Now the world was completely quiet.</p><p>Under the White Tiger Golden Tower, Xi opened his mouth and silently took out a black gold bounty from his pocket.</p><p>On the portrait was Xu Xiaoshou’s face with a subtle smirk.</p><p>It was an early black gold bounty from the period in the Yunlun Mountain Range which Xi had kept all along.</p><p>Back then, Xu Xiaoshou’s strength was evaluated to be only at the Cutting Path Stage, but now…</p><p>With just one finger…</p><p>Ninety percent of his strength..</p><p>Xi took a deep breath, unable to ask any more questions.</p><p>People didn’t recognize the towering tree until it truly stood tall in the sky.</p><p>“Drip.”</p><p>“This is Hallmaster Dao speaking, all members of the Heavenly Group, pay attention. ”</p><p>“Array Eye Number One, the clone of Ao Sheng, the newly appointed Spirit Division Chief, encountered the Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou, and the battle lasted for three breaths.”</p><p>“Everyone, unless it’s the higher void, do not form arrays. Report immediately upon encountering the enemy. If possible, retreat first; if necessary, engage, but do not hide.”</p><p>“That’s all.”</p><p>In front of the Azure Dragon Golden Tower, after listening to these instructions directed to all members, Ao Sheng felt weak in the knees and almost fell to the ground.</p><p>Xi was one thing, and there were only a few others on the channel who could hear.</p><p>But why…</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao, why did you betray me too?!”</p><p>Black Water Stream.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou effortlessly defeated Ao Sheng with one move, as if squashing an ant without any hint of satisfaction or joy.</p><p>He had fought Divine Oracle, Yan Wuse, and others.</p><p>If he had to waste even a bit of energy and time just to deal with Ao Sheng, wouldn’t the results of this period of cultivation be in vain?</p><p>Having tested his combat strength, he switched back his consciousness.</p><p>In the unfolding events, as long as they did not encounter a demi-saint, Jin Ren would be more than capable of handling everything.</p><p>“What do you intend to do?”</p><p>MO MO had promptly distanced herself after the battle, feeling a sense of astonishment towards the mysterious “absorption technique.”</p><p>Yet, Xu Xiaoshou remained silent, and she refrained from asking.</p><p>Instead, all attention turned to Xu Xiaoshou as he suddenly began weaving intricate gestures in the air, as if setting up a spiritual array.</p><p>“A surprise,” Jin Ren exclaimed without turning his head, his excitement palpable.</p><p>The initial satisfaction after completing the additional touches had passed through Jin Ren’s consciousness for the first time. Though expected, Jin Ren still felt dissatisfied.</p><p>The unexpected joy was the promise made by the main body: if the demi-saint did not appear, everything would be under his control.</p><p>Now was the time for Jin Ren to showcase his talents!</p><p>With a mind full of strategies, today finally provided an opportunity to put his skills to use.</p><p>“Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh…”</p><p>Threads of spiritual energy leaped from his fingertips, sketching out a complex great array in the air.</p><p>Because Hallmaster Dao was a Divine Sorcerer, Jin Ren chose to respect the craft and not overstep. Instead, he meticulously arranged the spiritual array with the Art of Spiritual Array Disc beneath his feet.</p><p>In a matter of moments, a great array spread across the cliffs of the Black Water Stream.</p><p>Intricate and formidable, thousands of array eyes nested within its incredible structure.</p><p>Within the grand array, thirteen thousand six hundred positions were left vacant, as It awaiting their souls.</p><p>“Pop…”</p><p>Jin Ren chuckled mischievously, conjuring five compressed Refined Fire Seeds that condensed into explosive source seeds at his fingertips.</p><p>The technique of “Seeds on All Five Fingers”!</p><p>Although not at the Saint Stage, his current power level was extraordinary. This single explosive source seed could inflict severe damage even on higher void beings caught off guard.</p><p>“What is this?” MO MO remained puzzled.</p><p>On the side, Little Frost Ferret shuddered instinctively at the sight of the familiar source seed, sensing an ominous premonition.</p><p>Abyss Island, First Hall of Sins—this thing had maimed Jiang Buyi!</p><p>Jin Ren was not yet content.</p><p>He possessed Holy Emperor-level transformations, Eternal Vitality, and High Spirits.</p><p>If not for the risk of disrupting the Black Water Stream and stirring unknown variables related to the Ran Ming ruins, he wouldn’t hesitate to unleash the full power of the Seeds on All Five Fingers technique.</p><p>But he wasn’t one to settle for less. Despite the compromised quality, he pushed the quantity to its limits.</p><p>“Pop, pop, pop…”</p><p>In just a few breaths, using “Seeds on All Five Fingers” as the foundation, tens of thousands of explosive source seeds were condensed.</p><p>Stable and quiet, they resembled tempting candies waiting to be eaten.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, tens of thousands of explosive source seeds were shot into the grand array’s thirteen thousand six hundred empty positions. In an instant, the array lit up, resembling a galaxy of stars above the Black Water</p><p>Stream..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
