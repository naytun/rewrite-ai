Yue Gongli would often sneak out of the Holy Emperor’s secret realm to play outside.</p><p>Whenever there was a big event, he would definitely be there.</p><p>He was always there no matter what the occasion was and would make his presence felt.</p><p>There were many people who knew him, and Wei An was just one of them. He was one of those from the general public who looked up to him.</p><p>If there was no Holy Palace and if the Saint was not a guardian of the same lineage…</p><p>Perhaps in his entire life, Wei An would not be able to stand in such a situation and look Yue Gongli in the eye.</p><p>“Young Master Wei An.”</p><p>Yue Gongli’s fox-like eyes glanced over with a smile. “This seems to be the first time we’ve met?”</p><p>“Yes.” Wei An’s eyes were calm. He only nodded slightly and did not explain.</p><p>“No, no, no…” Yue Gongli shook his finger and smiled, “Maybe Master Wei An had forgotten about me. But this is not the first time we have met.”</p><p>Yue Gongli casually draped the red robe that belonged to the Ruler of the red-clothed people and flung it over his shoulders like a cloak as he reminisced.</p><p>“I remember now, we actually met during the Holy Palace Trial.”</p><p>“At that time, you were also here in the Four Symbols Secret Realm. You even won first place in the Black Tortoise Golden Tower points rankings. I witnessed it personally.” Yue Gongli pointed at his feet and said.</p><p>“You may have forgotten, but I did not. Young Master Wei An’s gentlemanly behavior as the ‘one who defeated without killing’ was renowned throughout the country.”</p><p>Wei An was stunned.</p><p>He thought about it carefully and realized that he had no recollection of this matter.</p><p>The trial-takers of his Holy Palace Trial were all focused on the trial. Why would they pay attention to a descendant of a Holy Emperor aristocratic family who had snuck out?</p><p>At that time, Wei An didn’t even know about the existence of the Holy Emperor aristocratic family.</p><p>Wei An’s memories of Yue Gongli were all about the glorious descendants of the Holy Emperor that he had seen in the various competitions, demi-saint clan meetings, and advanced secret realm trials after he entered the Holy</p><p>Palace.</p><p>It was all about looking up, there was never any equality.</p><p>Yue Gongli’s eyes narrowed and he continued.</p><p>“You might not be aware of this. When you first emerged, I saw your unlimited potential, even though I was only a young boy at that time.”</p><p>“Perhaps it’s a bit of a hindsight to say it now… However, when you were halfway through your trial at the Four Symbols Secret Realm, I went to the</p><p>Holy Palace and had a word with the seniors of your Saint Guardian lineage.”</p><p>“What did you say?” Wei An played the role of a good listener well; it was as if his words were like gold.</p><p>“I said, “This guy has a rare Guardian Attribute. If he is not up to your standard, can you give him to our Cold Palace Emperor Realm?”‘</p><p>Yue Gongli shrugged helplessly. “They really had a good sense of discernment!” Wei An couldn’t even tell if Yue Gongli was joking or if he was stating a fact. However, he roughly understood the meaning behind this person’s words.</p><p>“Thank you.” Wei An thanked him calmly.</p><p>“No! Don’t get me wrong!” Yue Gongli waved his hand and explained.</p><p>“I did not say this because I want you to owe me a favor.”</p><p>“If you had not worked hard, the Saint guards would not have taken a fancy to you, and I would not have said anything.”</p><p>“Back then, I was still young. I frequently sneaked out. Everyone despised me.”</p><p>“I specially went to the Holy Palace to talk nonsense. Actually, I wanted to use reverse psychology on the Holy Palace to eliminate the outstanding you from their list of candidates. Later..</p><p>Yue Gongli laughed and said.</p><p>“After that, I would be able to act as a third party to repair the broken relationship between you and the Holy Palace. I would give you the utmost care and love when you need the most support. In the end, you would willingly be abducted by me… Uh, to the Cold Palace Emperor Realm.”</p><p>When he spoke of this, he clicked his tongue again. He covered his face and sighed. “What a pity. The Holy Palace was not blind. It was too infuriating!” Wei An was once again stunned.</p><p>Yue Gongli’s explanation was very logical, and even the details were perfect. It was as if it had really happened before.</p><p>However, it didn’t matter if this was true or not.</p><p>What mattered most was that Wei An couldn’t understand why the new Ruler of the red-clothed people had said so much to him when he first appeared at the arena.</p><p>It was not only Wei An, but the hundreds of red and white-clothed people who stood outside of the saint calamity, as well as Cen Qiaofu, who transcended the tribulation, were all stunned.</p><p>The moment this person appeared, he interrupted all the rhythm!</p><p>Cen Qiaofu instinctively had a premonition, but he didn’t know where this bad feeling came from or how it would develop.</p><p>However, he was well aware of this kind of rhythm destroyer and had been played by this kind of person before.</p><p>Even though he didn’t know what Yue Gongli’s purpose was, he knew that he should interrupt him to prevent any accidents from happening.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>After the saint calamity locked onto a demi-saint, it became indescribably terrifying. Cen Qiaofu suffered greatly.</p><p>“The Guardian Attribute! ”</p><p>“What a rare and great attribute! ”</p><p>Yue Gongli paused for a moment, then made an exaggerated gesture where he hugged the void.</p><p>He stared at Wei An intently and said.</p><p>“The saint calamity can’t even break your defense!”</p><p>“Even if you drag around four oil dispensers and need to protect them… Uh, are there two people or four people?”</p><p>“It’s not important. None of this is important!”</p><p>Yue Gongli glanced at Cen Qiaofu and shook his head. He stared at Wei An and said with emotion..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
