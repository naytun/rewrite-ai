As a result, aside from the force of the Azure Dragon Range maintaining its shape, the remaining land gradually formed into a deep ravine resembling a sheer cliff.</p><p>The deep ravine was perpetually shrouded in black mist, owing to the mysterious and powerful black water flowing below. Hence, this place was also known as the “Black Water Stream.”</p><p>When Jin Ren, accompanied by Elder Han and MO MO, landed on the mountain peak, they could already sense the complete disorder of the Path Principles around them.</p><p>The peculiarity here was no less than the nine extreme grounds on the Outer Island of the Abyss Island.</p><p>Even before jumping into the abyss below, the activity of spiritual sources in their bodies was already restricted, like gears rapidly succumbing to rust, gradually becoming stiff and sluggish.</p><p>“The God-Slaying Token is guiding me,” MO MO spoke immediately upon landing, affirming the sensations she had felt during the numerous teleportations along the way.</p><p>She still held the God-Slaying Token in her arms, which was half her height.</p><p>Every time the God-Slaying Token tilted forward, it coincided with the direction indicated by Elder Han and the spatial jumps of Jin Ren.</p><p>Therefore, she didn’t dare to delay, fearing that there might be some small details she had overlooked.</p><p>“Guidance?” Jin Ren’s arm hairs stood on end.</p><p>In this chaotic place, he was particularly sensitive to this unusual term.</p><p>Perched on the shoulder of Lord Shou’s clone, the Little Frost Ferret sniffed the air and said, “That means someone has entered the Ran Ming ruins, and at least one God-Slaying Token has returned.”</p><p>“How so?” Jin Ren tilted his head.</p><p>The Little Frost Ferret paused and explained, “There are three God-Slaying Tokens, and the Ran Ming ruins have a special power that continually calls back the lost tokens, compelling them to return in various ways. This activates the Ran Ming ruins and unseals the inheritance.”</p><p>“Perhaps, when I first obtained the God-Slaying Token, I received this ‘guidance’… Hmm, when one God-Slaying Token returns, or even more, the calling becomes stronger!”</p><p>“The most serious case is that even a demi-saint holding a God-Slaying Token may not know why they came here, but they will willingly jump into the Black Water Stream due to some special reason, perhaps just out of curiosity.” “Like you?” Jin Ren smirked.</p><p>“Uh…” The Little Frost Ferret scratched its head, and its fluffy face showed a hint of embarrassment.</p><p>“He reminded me,” MO MO interjected, not claiming credit, but providing an explanation.</p><p>She had only found it strange but hadn’t paid much attention.</p><p>It was Feng Yujin who deliberately pointed it out, making her realize that this strangeness needed to be mentioned and taken seriously.</p><p>“Somebody has been down there…”</p><p>Jin Ren didn’t care about the trivial contributions from whoever, but he became alert to Elder Han’s information.</p><p>The “guidance” MO MO sensed was strong enough for Feng Yujin to be cautious, indicating that this power was already formidable.</p><p>There was at least one person below, or maybe even two…</p><p>When Elder Han first appeared at the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes on Abyss Island, he mentioned the whereabouts of the remaining two God-Slaying Tokens…</p><p>“Are the other two God-Slaying Tokens in the possession of the Holy Divine Palace?” Jin Ren inquired to confirm.</p><p>“Yes,” nodded Little Frost Ferret.</p><p>“Below, either a single person or a group of two, has gathered with a demi-saint, waiting patiently like sitting ducks,” Jin Ren gazed into the unfathomable depths of the Black Water Stream.</p><p>Little Frost Ferret’s claws trembled upon hearing this.</p><p>So, jumping down would be equivalent to walking into a trap?</p><p>MO MO was somewhat puzzled but didn’t ask anything.</p><p>Feng Yujin wasn’t one to hold back, “There are only three God-Slaying Tokens in total. Apart from mine, it’s either one or two others. You’ve figured out all the possibilities… Aren’t you impressive, Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>How could Feng Yujin still be holding a grudge?</p><p>Had the resentment from Tianxuan Gate not been resolved yet?</p><p>At that time, it was Feng Yujin who wanted to kill Xu Xiaoshou… Jin Ren smiled, “Let me share something that is not necessarily one or two. There is only one person below, and it’s most likely not the main combatant demi-saint of the Holy Divine Palace, probably inconsequential.’</p><p>“Oh? Can you figure that out too?” Feng Yujin sneered, “Then tell me, why?”</p><p>“I could tell you, but why should I explain it to you?”</p><p>“You!”</p><p>“Glared At, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Why?” MO MO’s angry gaze softened in time, her voice cutting off the verbal dispute between these two.</p><p>Jin Ren said, “If I were Elder Dao, I would return one God-Slaying Token to its place, summon the lost one, and then hold the third one.</p><p>“In this way, whenever the Ran Ming ruins open, the initiative will always be in my hands.”</p><p>“And this third one, either I personally hold on to it, or it must be held by an elite combatant under my command, such as…”</p><p>Jin Ren paused, recalling the list of the Council of Ten he had seen before, and found his answer.</p><p>“Such as one of the three newly appointed demi-saints.”</p><p>Hopefully not Dao Xuanji.</p><p>It shouldn’t be; he seemed to be a Divine Sorcerer.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>MO MO remained silent, seemingly resisting something with a frown.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately noticed the new cursing monster, Holy Emperor Fengtian, Feng Yujin.</p><p>“Shall we go down?”</p><p>Little Frost Ferret looked around, feeling an inexplicable chill standing atop the mountain, as if someone was watching from behind, and was the first to suggest descending into the Black Water Stream.</p><p>—Jin Ren and MO MO could go down without a problem, but its abilities would be completely sealed!</p><p>“People are coming,” MO MO suddenly looked up towards the distance, “They’ll be here soon.”</p><p>“Who?” Little Frost Ferret’s claws stiffened, following her gaze..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
