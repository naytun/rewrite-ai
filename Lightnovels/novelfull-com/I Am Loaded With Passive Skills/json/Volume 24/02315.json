It was as casual as if he stepped on a row of ants when he passed by.</p><p>In just a few breaths of time, only the two higher void levels were left alive.</p><p>The banging sounds continued, but they still couldn’t catch Jin Ren’s attack moves. They could only rely on the prediction of life and death to avoid any fatal attacks.</p><p>Even so, the two of them were covered in bloody wounds-sometimes it was better to die than to live!</p><p>“Young Master Xu, I know my mistake. You have killed twenty-five people already. Please let us go.”</p><p>“That’s right, Young Master Xu. I was blind just now… Oh!”</p><p>The air waves pushed away the ripples in the void. The power of the Point of Path broke his throat and sealed off his voice.</p><p>When the higher void fell to the ground with a bang, the hall was in an uproar.</p><p>“Point of Path!”</p><p>“This is the Ancient Sword Technique of the Eastern Region, one of the 3000 Sword Styles. I’ve seen it before!”</p><p>“I didn’t see Jin Ren, but he used two fingers. I saw it, but his speed…”</p><p>It was just speed, but it was extremely fast!</p><p>If they hadn’t seen it from their peripheral visions, those two fingers wouldn’t even have appeared in everyone’s spiritual senses. They would have only been forgotten.</p><p>As the surprised voices rang out, some of the killers in the hall seemed to recognize the sickly young master.</p><p>“Are you the successor of the Eastern Region’s Sword Burial Tomb, the one who fought with Ghostface from the Ghost God gang?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned in surprise.</p><p>These killers had such powerful connections. They had only been in the Central Region for two days, and someone had already heard of him?</p><p>But…</p><p>“I told you to shut up. Did I tell you to speak?” Bang!</p><p>This finger move was actually dodged in advance.</p><p>The purple hunting token killers could not keep up with Jin Ren’s reaction speed, but their sensitivity to life and death was something that the ordinary higher void levels could not keep up with. This was a pre-judgment evasion.</p><p>“I’m sorry…” The man hurriedly apologized.</p><p>“Did I ask you to apologize?”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>With another finger move, the person who spoke just now was dead.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sneered. He had no regard for lives. “The higher void level can’t even get a gold hunting token. How dare you bark?”</p><p>There was dead silence in the hall.</p><p>How could one become a gold hunting token killer so easily?</p><p>Even the only Elder who was part of the group had a mask on, but everyone could sense the bitterness on his face.</p><p>He only had a purple hunting token.</p><p>He couldn’t hold on much longer.</p><p>“It had already come to this. How can the director of the Three Incenses still put up with it?” The old killer was covered with bloody wounds.</p><p>He had suffered badly.</p><p>A thought flashed across everyone’s minds. ‘This Xu Gusheng is so tough that he might explode!’</p><p>“Young Master Xu, stop immediately…”</p><p>Finally, a long-bearded Elder walked over from the stairs on the second floor. His steps were hurried. When he saw the sickly young master’s cold gaze, he was shocked.</p><p>“Wait! Don’t kill me yet!”</p><p>“I am the director of the Three Incenses. Young Master Xu caused such a ruckus because of me…</p><p>“Did I cause a ruckus?” The sickly young master’s lips curled up in a sneer.</p><p>The director slapped himself. “It’s something minimal! These were all small fights! Young Master Xu, can you stop so we can have a chat?”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The sounds stopped.</p><p>The old killer who moved around in the void and even used the Blood Escape Technique, was suddenly blasted to the highest position on the Three Incenses mission column.</p><p>There was a bloody hole on his forehead, and his mask shattered and dropped off. His eyes were filled with regret and hatred.</p><p>But It was too late…</p><p>His body slowly slid down and brought along with it all the bounty notices on the mission board and they dropped to the ground with a bang.</p><p>The Black Gold Bounty at the highest point also dropped. It flipped in the air and finally covered his dead face.</p><p>“It’s quiet now.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his folding fan and as he walked over, the words ‘I am Xu Gusheng’ swayed along. He bent down and picked up the Black Gold Bounty that was on the face of the unknown higher void level killer under everyone’s gaze in the hall. “Name: Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>“Age: Nineteen.”</p><p>“Cultivation level : Sovereign Dao Realm (doubtful), Sovereign Physique (doubtful), Seven Sword Deity.” “Background: Tiansang Spirit Palace, Saint Servant, First Pavilion in the Sky.”</p><p>“Combat strength: Demi-saint.”</p><p>“Bounty Level: Dispirited Corpse, Saint Stage.”</p><p>“Prize money: 10,000 spirit gems, the right to enter the Heart Washing Pool, a Body Changing Lotus Seed, a Holy Miracle Fruit, a Saint Martial Arts (any attribute), an Inscription Stele- Divine Instrument owned by the Three Incenses, a semi-saint person…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou only glanced at it before he calmly looked away. He had a new understanding of why he always encountered killers.</p><p>The Black Gold Bounty had been updated again!</p><p>The rewards were even more ample than the information obtained from Elder Xie and the others.</p><p>The prize money reward could be easily translated into a sentence:</p><p>“If you manage to capture Xu Xiaoshou and deliver him to the demi-saint, you do not need to worry about your future. At the same time, you can also protect your descendants and the entire family. You will be the future family head of a Demi-Saint Family.”</p><p>Me!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou- the original person! My actual name – I’m moved!</p><p>“Unfortunately…”</p><p>As he rolled up the Black Gold Bounty in his hand, Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze fell on the elderly higher void level who had died so grievously.</p><p>Not everyone was as difficult to kill as Yi.</p><p>Not everyone could survive a headshot.</p><p>For some higher void level, he did not need to care about the soul or will. If his physical body died, he would not be able to recover.</p><p>“Unfortunately, you did not know who you faced even after your death…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed silently. With the Black Gold Bounty in one hand and a paper fan in the other, he stood up and turned around to look at the director.</p><p>From the beginning to the end, Jin Ren didn’t even need to show his face; he just killed all the blasphemers just now.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew the rules of survival in this dark world better than any other killer present because he had read the memories of more than one gold hunting token killer.</p><p>You are weak, they are strong.</p><p>If you were tough, they would be soft.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fanned himself, and the breeze sent his gaze to the director of the Three Incenses.</p><p>He easily recognized that this was a person who had a glib tongue. He was also one of the targets of his trip. Elder Xie and the others had seen him before.</p><p>However, Xu Gusheng did not know him, so the sickly young master tilted his head and asked lightly.</p><p>“In short, are you really the director or are you just pretending to be one?” “Remember, this is not a multiple choice question.”</p><p>The director’s back was instantly drenched in cold sweat. He realized that if he shook his head, he would be the next one to fall to the ground with a hole in his head.</p><p>The so-called ‘Jin Ren’ was probably someone who was not at the peak of the higher void level or even had the combat strength of a demi-saint. He could not even touch his shadow!</p><p>“I am the director! Definitely!”</p><p>There had never been a time till the present when the director needed to show his confidence in front of an outsider like this.</p><p>“Alright.’</p><p>The sickly young master kept his folding fan and raised the Black Gold Bounty in his hand. “Do you know this person?”</p><p>“Lord Shou?” The director glanced at it and nodded his head. “Of course I know him. He’s very famous!”</p><p>“I’ll accept this bounty. I know where he is..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
