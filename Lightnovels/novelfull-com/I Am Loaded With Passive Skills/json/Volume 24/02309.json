It was another weapon that the Holy Divine</p><p>Palace couldn’t reveal.</p><p>“What do you think about the Ghost God gang? Are there any members of the Holy Divine Palace among them?” Xu Xiaoshou spoke again.</p><p>At this moment, Yingying and Qiao’er’s hearts trembled for no reason.</p><p>They knew that the Ghost God gang belonged to The Divine and The Divine belonged to Aunt Xiang.</p><p>To put it another way, the Ghost God gang were the hired thugs of the Yougui Pavilion. They would never bite their owner’s sword.</p><p>What did Young Master Xu mean when he asked this question?</p><p>Old Man Li, who drove the carriage, said, “Young Master, you’re such a joker. The Three Incenses even failed to escape. Can the Ghost God gang still defy the will of Heaven?”</p><p>“Bullshit!” Yingying couldn’t help but curse.</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>A strange sound came from outside the curtain of the osmanthus carriage. Old Man Li’s embarrassed voice followed. “You heard what I said. I’m so sorry…”</p><p>“Idiot! ”</p><p>“Vulgar!”</p><p>Yingying and Qiao’er were both furious and were about to get up.</p><p>However, when they tried, it was as if an invisible ghost was in the carriage and pressed down on their legs.</p><p>The two women couldn’t get up at all!</p><p>The sickly young master was still fanning himself. He smiled. “Once the force grows, there will definitely be parasites. Old Man Li has a profound understanding.”</p><p>“Hehe, these are all life experiences. In this line of work, you have to know more about miscellaneous things to earn money to support your family!” The old coachman smiled and ignored the two women’s anger. He only had his employer, Young Master Xu, in his heart.</p><p>The carriage continued forward.</p><p>After travelling for about fifteen minutes, Old Man Li suddenly said.</p><p>“Young master, there is a lady blocking the way. It seems that she is here to look for us…</p><p>After a pause, he asked curiously.</p><p>“This lady looks familiar. Did we see her that day we entered the city?”</p><p>“After that, she seemed to have waited outside the Exotic Pavilion for a night?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Of course, he had seen Li Fuyu, who blocked his way.</p><p>However, Old Man Li’s eyes were so sharp. How could he remember the passers-by in the long queue that day?</p><p>“You know her?”</p><p>“I saw her when I went to pee. I even went up to greet Old Li. I wanted to greet her too and was almost ‘greeted’ by her!”</p><p>“Who is she?”</p><p>“Young Master, her outfit is not appealing. She’s really a swordsman. She’s known as… Li Fuyu?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was confused for a moment. He didn’t know if Old Man Li was pretending or what.</p><p>Did this person really not recognize what the three words ‘Li Fuyu’ represented? Or did he think that she happened to have the same name as one of the new Seven Sword Deity?</p><p>“Go around her.”</p><p>“Oh. ”</p><p>Old Man Li turned the carriage around and did not comment any further.</p><p>He was very familiar with this scenario. The person who blocked the road would definitely not be able to see his carriage.</p><p>It was just like how Young Master Xu managed to make the city guards oblivious to their presence when they entered the city.</p><p>As expected, Li Fuyu, who blocked the way, had a trace of doubt in her eyes.</p><p>She had clearly seen the person she was waiting for get into the carriage, so she followed him.</p><p>After she followed it for a while and confirmed its aura, the carriage disappeared again under her watch.</p><p>On this long street filled with endless streams of people, Li Fuyu did not hesitate. She held her slender sword and cupped her fists. She then shouted.</p><p>“Sword Tower, Li Fuyu!”</p><p>“Can you show yourself?”</p><p>The din on the long street immediately died down and everything became silent.</p><p>Some people stopped eating, some turned around, and some stopped their bargaining…</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were fixed on the graceful female swordsman.</p><p>Who was she talking to?</p><p>The female swordsman didn’t say anything. Her eyes were unfocused and she didn’t even blink.</p><p>She wasn’t embarrassed, but everyone felt embarrassed for her.</p><p>However, if they really encountered such a thing, no one would really go up and ask, “What are you doing?”</p><p>Everyone would only be afraid that they would be infected by the other party’s disease, so after they paused, they would go back to their homes and tend to their business.</p><p>Li Fuyu lost her target again.</p><p>In the carriage, Xu Xiaoshou, who had used the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale to achieve the oblivion effect, did not want to come into contact with the Sword Deity for the time being.</p><p>He thought for a long time, but he still could not figure out why Li Fuyu was looking for him.</p><p>However, he was sure that this woman was really dumb. She was not the fish he wanted to catch.</p><p>“Seven… Seven Sword Deity?” Yingying and Qiao’er were also silent the entire way. It was only when the carriage stopped that they spoke with uncertainty.</p><p>“Yes.” Xu Xiaoshou did not hide anything.</p><p>He used his Perception and saw that the two women were dumbfounded after he said that.</p><p>There was also Old Man Li, who was still at ease in the front of the carriage. He was not bothered by anything in the least. He only needed to send his employer to his destination.</p><p>To be able to remain calm even when he heard about the Seven Sword Deity, was this also part of his life experience?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned and alighted from the carriage with the help of the two women. He looked up and saw a dilapidated grocery store.</p><p>“This is the entrance.” Old Man Li said. “You don’t have to say anything when you go in. Just state Three Incenses and the shop owner will take you to the black market to wherever you want to go.”</p><p>Yingying and Qiao’er suddenly felt flustered. It was their first time to visit such a place.</p><p>The Saint Killer Hall sounded terrifying.</p><p>“What about you?” Xu Xiaoshou turned around.</p><p>“I will wait here for the young master to come out.” Old Man Li turned around and pointed at the carriage.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded and stepped into the small shop.</p><p>However, after he entered the shop, he stopped. With Yingying on his left and Qiao’er on his right, he turned around and smiled. “Later, I have many friends who will be here.”</p><p>“Old Li, you know so much. Do you think they’re here?”</p><p>Old Man Li had already returned to the carriage. He scratched his head. “Young Master Xu, this question of yours. How could I possibly know where your friends are?”</p><p>“But don’t you have a lot of life experiences?”</p><p>“Uh, then tell me, Young Master Xu, where are your friends from?” “Eastern region.”</p><p>“Eastern region? So far away? Then perhaps they are still far away!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
