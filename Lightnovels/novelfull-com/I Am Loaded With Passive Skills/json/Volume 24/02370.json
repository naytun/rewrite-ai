In his mind flashed the solemn face of Dao Qiongcang:</p><p>“Silence!”</p><p>“Senior Wei Feng, I have only one request for this battle: fight with a calm heart, embodying the ‘silence’ you’ve grasped over decades in the Dead Sea.”</p><p>“You can unleash all your skills—shatter the heavens, demolish the Ran Ming ruins; it doesn’t matter.”</p><p>“But if you encounter Xu Xiaoshou in your defensive position, consider his words as nothing more than hot air.”</p><p>“If you can’t do this, withdraw from the Heavenly Group. I’ll find someone else to guard this post.”</p><p>“Don’t use the excuse of Yama’s Banquet getting out of control later. I’ve already thought of every possible excuse you might think of. Take a look at this jade scroll when you have time.”</p><p>As Wei Feng touched the jade scroll named “Collection of Excuses” in his chest, the crimson in his eyes faded slightly, and his emotions became calmer than before their conversation.</p><p>One couldn’t deny the creation and presence of that jade scroll were quite absurd.</p><p>But its effect was extraordinary!</p><p>Initially dismissed by Wei Feng as worthless, the seemingly insignificant item only cost a few hundred Spirit Crystals to make.</p><p>At the moment, it surpassed even the most expensive Divine Artifact, rare Inscription Stele, or Divine Instrument, delivering a more profound calming effect.</p><p>Wei Feng knew that once he lost control and news of the “Collection of Excuses” spread…</p><p>His lifelong reputation would be ruined in an instant!</p><p>“I won’t deny that you’ve won before. It’s indeed something you can boast about, having defeated a demi-saint…”</p><p>“But, isn’t that what rats do?”</p><p>Wielding a broadsword, Wei Feng sneered softly, “Clinging to life and taking pride in it. Little do they know, it’s just a joke!”</p><p>Jin Ren was taken aback by Wei Feng’s words, his expression perplexed.</p><p>That was strange.</p><p>This contradicted the information he had received!</p><p>Wasn’t it said that this person was prone to fits of madness, easily triggered at the slightest provocation, and most susceptible to psychological attacks, making him the most dangerous but also the easiest to kill?</p><p>Both Xu Xiaoshou and Jin Ren were experienced in dealing with such individuals.</p><p>However, after observing Wei Feng’s behavior, Jin Ren realized that this person shouldn’t be called the “God of Killing Wei Feng” but rather the “Guaranteed Not to Go Mad Wei Feng.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang misled him!</p><p>Jin Ren cursed silently in his mind but kept a composed expression as he proceeded toward the front, speaking as he walked. “Senior Wei Feng, you’re much more courteous than I imagined. I thought we’d have to start fighting as soon as we met!”</p><p>“With your murderous aura, I suppose you are here by the order of Hallmaster Dao to buy time?”</p><p>“What are you waiting for? Are you expecting reinforcements from outside?” Jin Ren chuckled, turning to look in the direction of the Black Water Stream:</p><p>“To be honest with you, those outside are being held back by my small clone. Eventually, they’ll be blown away by me. Whoever comes will be humiliated.” “I have plenty of time to spare with you, so if you want to talk…”</p><p>He changed the subject, returning to their previous conversation. “Are you not curious about the last words Elder Yan heard before they cost him his life?”</p><p>To be honest, Wei Feng was a bit curious… He shook his head and replied, “I don’t want to know.”</p><p>Wei Feng said his piece, and Jin Ren said his.</p><p>He actually walked to the side of the sword-wielding old man, bent down without fear of his life, and whispered by his ear, gazing at the entrance of the passage:</p><p>“I told him…”</p><p>Suppressing the impulse to chop off the man’s head with one blow, Wei Feng found himself strangely anticipating. “Told him what?”</p><p>Jin Ren’s lips curled up. “A good dog doesn’t block the road!”</p><p>In a flash, Wei Feng’s eyes turned crimson, white smoke rose from his head, and the broadsword, Yama’s Banquet, was immediately drawn out of his hand, slashing downward with force.</p><p>“Hey…</p><p>Jin Ren’s reaction was incredibly fast as he deftly sidestepped, narrowly evading the attack.</p><p>The edge of the Yama’s Banquet brushed past his waist, tearing off a piece of his clothes.</p><p>In that moment of ferocity, Jin Ren felt as if he had escaped from the jaws of a tiger.</p><p>Undeterred, he smiled and, with a swift gesture of his two fingers, unveiled gleaming, razor-sharp tips converging into the Glow of Sharpness, aiming straight for Wei Feng’s eye sockets.</p><p>“I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Quick response!</p><p>Wei Feng’s forceful downward strike had yet to be unleashed. Instead, he retracted and rose.</p><p>He knew Xu Xiaoshou had mastered sword cognition, and those two fingers were like famed swords. Therefore, he couldn’t afford to be complacent.</p><p>He raised the Yama’s Banquet, elbow resting on the blade for support, forming a horizontal block in front of him.</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>As the fingertips touched the blade, there was a piercing clash that reverberated at the entrance of the passage, raising a cloud of dust.</p><p>Jin Ren remained unfazed.</p><p>Wei Feng, on the other hand, felt as if he had blocked the impact of an extraterrestrial meteor. Most of the force was absorbed by Yama’s Banquet, but the remaining momentum still caused him to sway slightly, almost staggering a half-step backward.</p><p>He didn’t retreat, knowing that if he relaxed his force, the blade would become weak.</p><p>At the same time, Jin Ren’s eyes sparkled with cunning, and he chuckled. “A speck in the eye hides the great mountain.”</p><p>“Let me see what this good thing is that made you, a Saint of Blades, touch it three times in our brief exchange! ”</p><p>With sharp eyes and deft hands, Jin Ren seized the opportunity during their first encounter, catching the God of Killing, Wei Feng, off guard. He conjured a hand made of spiritual energy and swiftly reached into Wei Feng’s chest, retrieving a purple jade scroll.</p><p>A sweep of spiritual senses.</p><p>No mysteries, no divine secrets.</p><p>It was just an ordinary jade scroll. Why did he keep touching it?</p><p>“Damn you!”</p><p>Little did he know that as soon as the jade scroll left Wei Feng’s possession, he seemed to go unhinged on the spot. Transforming into a ferocious warrior, he roared, his eyes almost popping out as he cursed:</p><p>“Give it back!!!”</p><p>In an instant, Jin Ren realized that this jade scroll was definitely not as simple as he had imagined..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
