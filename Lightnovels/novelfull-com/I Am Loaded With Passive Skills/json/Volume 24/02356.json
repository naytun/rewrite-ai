He looked very young, was he also a trial-taker?</p><p>NO!</p><p>It seemed to be Lord Shou of the Saint Servant!</p><p>Before they could ask more questions, batches of trial-takers were ushered away by the white-clothed people.</p><p>Two-quarters of an hour passed.</p><p>On the Black Water Stream, Saint Servant Lord Shou sat at a table with a cup of tea, facing off against hundreds of Cutting Path and Higher Void cultivators.</p><p>Outside the Black Water Stream, curious trial-takers even spared the deviant ghosts, observing from afar.</p><p>This scene troubled the red and white-clothed people, as news of such a spectacle spreading would not bode well.</p><p>Finally, their wait bore fruit.</p><p>Sword energy traversed the sky as one of the newly appointed three emperors, the white-clothed Ruler, the almost Seventh Sword Deity, Beibei, descended upon Black Water Stream!</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Beibei’s voice was crisp, looking younger than all the white and red-clothed people present.</p><p>In any other place, her entry would only be seen as that of one of the trial-takers.</p><p>However, this white-clothed female Sword Deity held an enormous coffin-shaped sword sheath, displaying extraordinary force and strength.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is over there.”</p><p>Before Cheng Huan cleared his throat, no one had offered a response. He respectfully stepped forward, discreetly sizing up his superior, who happened to be almost the same age as his granddaughter.</p><p>Beibei leaned the sword sheath to her side, creating a large pit on the ground with a thud.</p><p>“You are Xu Xiaoshou?” Her big eyes sparkled with curiosity, looking towards the illusory figure in front of her.</p><p>Two elders, Yi Xiao Liu Fuyu, and Hua Lai Bei Tian welcomed Lord Shou. Among the Seven Sword Deities, the person in front of her was only one rank lower than herself.</p><p>Of course, this was the result before any battle.</p><p>Behind the tea table, the nonchalant young man finally made a move at the sound of her voice.</p><p>The emotions of hundreds of white-clothed individuals tightened as Lord Shou stood up behind the table, smiling slightly at Sword Deity Beibei. He put down the tea cup and gestured:</p><p>“Care for a drink?”</p><p>With a flip of his hand, wine and tea cups appeared on the table, free for her to choose.</p><p>Beibei’s small face showed a peculiar expression.</p><p>Leaving aside other matters, Xu Xiaoshou’s appearance and his fearless demeanor towards the Saint Hall were indeed stunning.</p><p>It seemed Xu Xiaoshou had something to say, rather than engage in a sword fight. Hence, Beibei put down the sword sheath and walked towards the tea table alone.</p><p>“Be careful, Sword Deity Bei!” Cheng Huan couldn’t help but whisper.</p><p>“No worries.”</p><p>Beibei gestured with a simple wave of her hand, then approached the table, finding nothing unusual.</p><p>On the contrary, it was Xu Xiaoshou before her who seemed odd, almost as if he weren’t a real person.</p><p>“What do you want to say?” Bei Tian was fearless, not afraid of anything in the world, but when she wanted to sit down, she found that Xu Xiaoshou had not courteously prepared a chair for her.</p><p>Across the tea table, the young man stood up, towering a head above Beibei.</p><p>He leisurely chose a new cup, poured a fresh tea, and handed it over.</p><p>Beibei reached out to take it.</p><p>The young man forcefully flung the teacup.</p><p>With a splash, hot tea spilled all over Beibei’s unsuspecting face, staining the Sword Deity’s white robe with shades of brown.</p><p>Beibei’s eyes widened in shock.</p><p>Her hand remained extended in place—she even reached out to receive the tea, a sign of respect among ancient swordsmen.</p><p>But she didn’t receive the tea; instead, she was hit by an overwhelming shock.</p><p>At this moment, the hundreds of red-clothed and white-clothed people behind her couldn’t help but feel a chill as they witnessed the scene. They wanted to pretend they didn’t see anything, but they couldn’t.</p><p>After all, there were hundreds of people present.</p><p>And some young folks were hiding and watching from the outside…</p><p>The silence at the edge of the cliff was deafening.</p><p>“What I wanted to say is…”</p><p>The young man across the tea table crushed the cup in his hand and chuckled:</p><p>“Everyone here is trash.”</p><p>His gaze finally focused on Beibei, her face still dripping with tea.</p><p>“Including you.”</p><p>Beibei’s eyes trembled, her body trembled, her entire being, even her soul, trembled.</p><p>She lowered her head and saw the prominent brown tea stain on her white robe, embroidered with the Azure Cloud pattern.</p><p>Ah…!</p><p>She finally couldn’t hold back her scream. With a stretch of her hand, the sword sheath behind her came whistling at her beckon.</p><p>“Formation.”</p><p>But at this moment, the young man across the tea table leaped up, transforming into an array eye.</p><p>With a command, within a radius of several miles, from the mountainous locations where the white-clothed and red-clothed people stood to the trial-takers who fearlessly observed from afar, to Beibei at the cliff’s edge, and even the airspace above the Black Water Stream beneath the cliff…</p><p>The great array of stars lit up in an instant, covering everything.</p><p>“Watch out!”</p><p>Beibei’s pupils dilated as she shouted, sensing something was wrong and attempting to dodge the attack.</p><p>She hadn’t even retrieved her sword sheath when Xu Xiaoshou, who had vanished into thin air, let out a final chuckle:</p><p>“Explode! ”</p><p>Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom….</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
