It had the same effect as the silver-white Sword Will that the ancient swordsman slashed out with their sword energy.</p><p>But soon, he realized that something was wrong.</p><p>The blood-red rage that had erupted from Wei Feng’s body was too condensed. It could even turn from a gaseous state into a thick liquid state.</p><p>This wasn’t something that could be achieved through the materialization of</p><p>‘intent’.</p><p>This was the way to use the Penetrating Divine Senses!</p><p>“Wei Feng, you’ve grasped the Penetrating Divine Senses?”</p><p>All Jin Ren wanted to do now was to shout, “Aunt Xiang has wronged me!”</p><p>In the Yougui Pavilion, the jade scroll that Aunt Xiang had given him about the Council of Ten had not recorded this crucial information at all.</p><p>From the current situation, it seemed that the angrier Wei Feng became, the stronger his killing intent and his Penetrating Divine Senses became?</p><p>This reckless man clearly relied on his entering a berserk state to deal out the damage. How could he make him lose his mind by angering him and then control him like Yan Wushi and Rao Yaoyao?</p><p>“Collection of Excuses…</p><p>All his mistakes were in the ‘Collection of Excuses”!</p><p>He had this vague thought that Dao Qiongcang could have set up the words ‘Ran Ming ruins, Xu Xiaoshou appeared’ in the jade scroll in advance.</p><p>It wasn’t hard to see that this jade scroll wasn’t meant to let Wei Feng and Xu Xiaoshou have a calm fight from the start.</p><p>Its original intention was to make him fall into Xu Xiaoshou’s hands and kill him with a borrowed knife-kill the rational Wei Feng. Then use the same borrowed knife and let the God of Killing return to the state of God of Killing and kill Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>It was true that the process of the jade scroll changing hands was a little complicated, but Elder Dao the Flamboyant’s ultimate goal had still been achieved. Jin Ren thought of this and felt as if he had swallowed a fly.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, you’re so disgusting.”</p><p>He had finally thought it through.</p><p>This matter could not be blamed on Aunt Xiang.</p><p>Wei Feng, the God of Killing was a figure from Elder You Tu’s era and had basically never made a move.</p><p>Even if there was something he needed to settle, he probably didn’t need to use his Penetrating Divine Senses.</p><p>Therefore, it was normal for Aunt Xiang not to know about this.</p><p>It could only be said that in order to deal with Xu Xiaoshou, Dao Qiongcang was ruthless. Just like how Cen Qiaofu’s sanctification expanded when they met! “Ha…</p><p>Under the effect of the killing thought, Wei Feng seemed to have really gone crazy.</p><p>He held the Yama’s Banquet in his hand, opened his mouth, and spat out a blood-red stream of air. His posture was extremely relaxed.</p><p>In the next second, Wei Feng’s red eyes narrowed and all the muscles in his body tensed up.</p><p>He flipped the broadsword in his hand, and his speed reached its peak. He slashed the broadsword horizontally in the air and it flew toward MO Mo’s fair neck.</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>His voice sounded utterly deranged!</p><p>The saber flew toward the giant mural from the entrance of the tunnel. It was so fast that it cut off the air flow and space that bound the human body and shattered the Path Principles.</p><p>A knife to the throat, in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The killing thought set off the dark green Yama’s Banquet’s true red color. It was magnified infinitely in MO Mo’s eyes. Her battle consciousness was zero in comparison.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Voices rang out in the air.</p><p>The small bronze cauldron rattled, but MO Mo’s hand was still steady.</p><p>She followed Xu Xiaoshou into the Ran Ming ruins and was already mentally prepared when she was outside Jade Capital City.</p><p>The following battles were not something she could handle alone. Xu Xiaoshou’s enemies were all old monsters.</p><p>Her white dress remained the same, and the ice and snow were calm. The space collapsed in front of her, but the colors remain unchanged. Wei Feng stood excitedly on her left and his eyes were unblinking.</p><p>His Yama’s Banquet was faster than her voice, but she seemed to be three minutes ahead of time. Her voice was calm and there was no tremor in it.</p><p>“Feng Yujin, save me.”</p><p>The hem of her dress fluttered slightly amid the gray snow and jasmine.</p><p>When her voice stopped, there was a boom. The space at the entrance of the entire Ran Ming ruins exploded, and boundless gray fog surged over.</p><p>It swept MO MO up and bore her away like a snow-white lotus..</p><p>MO MO frowned, her eyes that hurt slightly were covered with a faint layer of gray ripples, and then a few wisps of gray fog drifted from her pupils.</p><p>“Ghost Hand!”</p><p>Her high chest puffed out, and an extremely compressed gray arm protruded from it.</p><p>As soon as the strange gray hand appeared, it crazily devoured the sealing mist that surged out of the surrounding space. In an instant, it ruthlessly strangled the Yama’s Banquet that slashed at her throat.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>There was no explosion.</p><p>There was only a familiar and strange sound in Jin Ren’s ears that made his thoughts flutter.</p><p>One of the Five Extreme Physiques, the Seal Body!</p><p>It was a special attribute that could even seal the Extended Passive Skill. It was a seal attribute!</p><p>Jin Ren looked at it at this moment and it jolted his memory.</p><p>He discovered that the Tiansang Spirit Palace was truly filled with hidden talents!</p><p>If he had received this information earlier, he would have known how valuable it was to win the Outer Yard’s Windcloud Competition. Why would he be dejected because he did not enter the Inner Yard?</p><p>Among them, there might be some schemers who wanted to take advantage of the situation and offered their timely assistance.</p><p>He should have known long ago that the seal attribute had been in the Spirit</p><p>Palace for so many years, but the outside world was completely unaware of it. The Four Disciples of the Holy Palace, or rather, the Sleeveless Saint Servant, must have suppressed a lot of information.</p><p>He should have known earlier why the seal ghost beast after it was released from the Infernal Hell Sea chose to stay in the Holy Palace. This was under the eyes of the Spirit Palace, the one that could easily expose him.</p><p>Everything could be traced.</p><p>Now, it seemed like he was trapped in a cage!</p><p>“Bang bang…”</p><p>The strange sound pulled people back to their senses.</p><p>When he looked over again, the God -Slaying Token that was half the height of a human had been placed on MO Mot s back. It was bound by the sealing mist chains and looked rather comical.</p><p>However, it was precisely because of this command token that the Holy Emperor, Fengtian Feng Yujin, was able to ignore everything in the Ran Ming ruins and take action in the Spell Forbidden Barrier..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
