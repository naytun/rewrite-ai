In just an instant, her expression and actions fused perfectly with her body.</p><p>At this moment, ‘she’ had actually completely transformed into a ghost beast and had been replaced by a ‘he’.</p><p>“Possession…”</p><p>There was no doubt that in this state, Feng Yujin only needed a thought to complete the deepest level of Possession. Other than gender, there were almost no side effects.</p><p>He had taken over MO Mo’s body before, but that was just a forced exchange of consciousness.</p><p>This time, it was completely different. It was a complete ‘replacement’!</p><p>At the very least, when Jin Ren used his Perception to look again, other than the familiar figure of MO MO who stood in front of him, he couldn’t sense the girl’s temperament at all.</p><p>For some reason, Jin Ren’s heart palpitated and he had mixed feelings.</p><p>He wondered if MO MO and Feng Yujin trusted each other so much that they would take the initiative to step back and put their lives in the hands of others?</p><p>However, when he thought about this, the glimpse of the two worlds separated by the void and nothing else and how MO MO embraced the darkness, floated before his eyes.</p><p>Like a lonely mandarin duck, with a firm iron will.</p><p>Did he misunderstand the emotion or was it something else?</p><p>“Feng Yujin!” Jin Ren suddenly spoke and his tone carried a strong warning.</p><p>Feng Yujin combed and rolled up his long hair behind his head and secured it with a hairpin. He sneered when he heard that sound.</p><p>“Your belated concern is even more worthless than grass.”</p><p>“Don’t worry. If I wanted to take possession of her, she would have died a few years ago.”</p><p>It made sense to Jin Ren.</p><p>Feng Yujin paused and stopped talking.</p><p>In the end, he couldn’t hold it in. Like a worried old father, he added, “But if you tell her that when she’s awake, she’ll be happy for three and a half days.”</p><p>Jin Ren was stunned. ” Why would it be… three and a half days?”</p><p>Feng Yujin rolled his eyes.</p><p>He couldn’t see where Xu Xiaoshou was hiding, but he held his skirt and turned 360 degrees as he took everything into account and looked on with contempt.</p><p>“Three days is the foundation, and half a day is the reward. Only half a day more is called self-control.</p><p>Jin Ren’s mind went blank.</p><p>In this short period of time, he couldn’t understand what Feng Yujin’s words meant.</p><p>After he said that, Feng Yujin looked back at Wei Feng, who was in front of him. A smile appeared on his lips as he praised him calmly.</p><p>“Your name is Wei Feng?”</p><p>“You’re pretty good. You’re one of the few people worthy of being a Saint. You waited for me to come out.</p><p>Wei Feng leaned on the Yama’s Banquet. His bloodshot eyes were filled with madness. He looked like he had gone berserk, but in fact, he could still speak.</p><p>“I’m Wei Feng. I don’t like to bully the weak.”</p><p>She was indeed just a little girl. She was timid when she spoke and did not even dare to express herself… Feng Yujin laughed involuntarily. Soon, his expression became solemn. He closed his eyes and said in a dense voice. “Then I have to apologize first. I like to bully the weak!”</p><p>“But don’t worry, you deserve to have your corpse kept intact.”</p><p>Wei Feng’s lips curled up in a sneer and his expression was calm.</p><p>He suddenly burst into laughter and the corners of his mouth almost reached his temples. His expression showed that he was completely out of control.</p><p>“Hahahaha, Holy Emperor!”</p><p>“Holy Emperor Fengtian, I’ve wanted to kill the Holy Emperor for a long time… Come and fight!”</p><p>The roar was like a meteor shower that crashed in all directions and spread everywhere.</p><p>The space cracked with the sound and shattered into a blood-colored sticky, special form of power that was a cross between energy and liquid-the killing thought.</p><p>In an instant, the vast entrance of the Ran Ming ruins was covered in a layer of hazy bloody light.</p><p>Even Beibei, who sat in the Black Water Stream and observed the battle while she studied the Penetrating Divine Senses, noticed the abnormality.</p><p>The moment she heard the sound, the surrounding black water was also covered in a layer of blood light.</p><p>“Not good! It’s here…”</p><p>Beibei quickly retreated rapidly before the bloody light could reach her and she was almost back into the Black Water Stream.</p><p>The killing thoughts that emitted a bloody light went as far as the Black Water Stream and approached the entrance of the tunnel in the ruins. It even went deep into the underground tunnel that Wei Feng had created when he split the giant mural with his saber.</p><p>It had turned into a barrier that was almost spherical and it had a physical existence.</p><p>“God of Killing domain!”</p><p>Wei Feng raised the Yama’s Banquet high in the air.</p><p>The Penetrating Divine Senses that covered a radius of tens of thousands of feet had formed completely. The scarlet thoughts were like needles that penetrated every inch of the skin of the person in it. They stimulated the divine soul and caused them to go berserk in an instant.</p><p>A high-pitched sound rang out.</p><p>The Frost Ferret that had stayed hidden underground and didn’t dare to show its head suddenly jumped up and returned to its original body as it flew out.</p><p>Its eyes were red and its maniacal cries rang out. It was clearly out of control.</p><p>Its strength was crazy, but the Power of Demons and Beasts was not enough to transform into wings that gave it the ability to spread its wings and escape. Wei Feng’s eyes shifted, and a sneer appeared on his lips. He slashed the Yama’s Banquet in the air.</p><p>“Demon Slayer!” One slash.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>On the high cliff of the Black Water Stream, everyone saw the saber marks after thousands of miles of land had caved in.</p><p>The murderous intent dyed the mountains and forests and the killing intent took away lives. From the same starting point, with a different trajectory, the flat landscape pushed open another road of death.</p><p>At the entrance of the Ran Ming ruins, Feng Yujin didn’t seem to have reacted. The saber light pierced through his body, and the Frost Ferret froze in midair.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Its afterimage shattered and turned into Space Fragments..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
