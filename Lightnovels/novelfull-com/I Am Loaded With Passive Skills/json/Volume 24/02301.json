However…”</p><p>However, this problem was easily solved.</p><p>He cracked it!</p><p>When he rushed in front of the enemy, he would activate the Independence. The enemy would not be able to see him and would forget about him. Then, he would turn off the Independence and launch a Passive Fist at him.</p><p>Hehe…</p><p>Presumably, even with The Divine’s battle consciousness, he would not be able to bear the consequences, right?</p><p>“Now that I think about it, am I more terrifying than the elusive Dao</p><p>Qiongcang?”</p><p>“Oh, Dao Qiongcang seems to be unpredictable…”</p><p>As he suppressed his excitement, Xu Xiaoshou told himself to calm down.</p><p>Because there were still two other powerful second awakenings that had yet to be tested!</p><p>“Agility, one step to reach the heavens and the Moment of Enlightenment…”</p><p>“Would this thing allow my reaction speed to temporarily break through to the third realm so that I can fight against those freaks like The Divine?” Xu Xiaoshou’s attention was focused on the second awakening.</p><p>This time, he was very arrogant. He waved his sleeve and shouted coldly.</p><p>“Moment of Enlightenment! ”</p><p>In an instant, his mental strength seemed to materialize into a net that spread out, and captured everything in the Apricot Realm.</p><p>“Zi zi…”</p><p>Xu Xioashou heard the sound of the seventh cauldron in the 382nd row among the 100,000 cauldrons.</p><p>The medicinal liquid that was being heated and refined inside emitted a sizzling sound. Under the lid of the alchemy cauldron, its chat could not be heard, but at this moment, it was extremely clear.</p><p>He could even use this to deduce that the medicinal liquid that was fused with the spiritual flowers, the white seeds, the grass python’s blood, and so on, had a 70% chance to form into an Elixir. Once the Elixirs were formed, they would be high-grade soul Elixirs.</p><p>Not only that, but the Moment of Enlightenment also enabled Xu Xiaoshou to hear Greedy the Cat Spirit’s breathing and its heartbeat.</p><p>It was extremely ear-piercing!</p><p>“Tsk…</p><p>On the other side, the Dragon Apricot Spirit sneakily stuck out a branch and licked the dragon blood. It scooped up enough blood for it to be converted into 72 drops.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked at himself.</p><p>He felt like he was a cheat, a God of cheats.</p><p>His thoughts, computational ability, consciousness, and reaction speed had all been upgraded by more than one level.</p><p>His spiritual source rapidly dried up.</p><p>However, his condition did not decline at all.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that this was the Moment of Enlightenment that had forcibly improved his status.</p><p>If he really waited until he exhausted his spiritual source before he deactivated the Moment of Enlightenment, he would very likely lie down directly this time.</p><p>He immediately stopped this second awakening.</p><p>The world fell silent.</p><p>The sounds of the wind, sand and the wild growth of the grass disappeared.</p><p>Actually, it wasn’t that they had disappeared, but Xu Xiaoshou was used to it.</p><p>If he listened carefully, he would still be able to hear those things with his Holy Emperor Lv.0 Agility technique.</p><p>However, the Moment of Enlightenment was too high-minded!</p><p>After he activated the two awakenings, it was as if he had the divine touch. Xu Xiaoshou felt that he was the Holy Emperor and the Ancestor Trees were trash.</p><p>He approached the Dragon Apricot again.</p><p>This time, he did not have the Independence technique. The Dragon Apricot Spirt was quickly awakened and materialized impatiently.</p><p>“Human, what is it?”</p><p>“Hit me.”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“Senior Dragon Apricot, use your fastest speed and whip me with your branch.”</p><p>“Within ten breaths, if you manage to hit me once, I will give you a bucket of blood.”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit did not understand. Perhaps this was the hobby of humans. However, after it heard the last statement, its eyes lit up.</p><p>The Ancestral Tree’s main body buzzed as it transformed into an illusion of thousands of branches that pierced through the sky like arrows.</p><p>“Moment of Enlightenment! ”</p><p>Without saying anything, Xu Xiaoshou activated his second awakening.</p><p>He didn’t even move his feet. With a thought, he went to the new wasteland of the Apricot Realm ten thousand miles away, far away from the Herb Garden of the Divine Farmer.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>He felt a burning sensation on his body, and at the same time, there was a burning smell.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou then realized that his speed was close to the speed of light. Even his Strengthen technique, that was close to the sacred physique, was charred black due to such speed.</p><p>“I have to get more elements!”</p><p>“Just like Yan Wuse, my speed can be even faster if I turn my body into elements!”</p><p>The reflexes brought by the Moment of Enlightenment were too strong.</p><p>After he determined this, the Dragon Apricot Spirit was in the Herb Garden of the Divine Farmer and faced Xu Xiaoshou’s humiliating invitation.</p><p>What was that human boy trying to test?</p><p>But wasn’t he a little too arrogant? Did he really think that even the Ancestral Tree couldn’t compare to his speed?</p><p>The sky was filled with dense branches.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked up and felt that these things were too slow.</p><p>His reaction speed and calculation ability allowed him to clearly confirm that the Dragon Apricot’s battle consciousness was definitely not at the third realm. Perhaps, it was only on par with him before he had the Moment of Enlightenment.</p><p>This caused its branches to whip about and it was clearly unable to display an absolutely sealed and unavoidable suppressive force.</p><p>In Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes, these flaws were as conspicuous as the forked roads in the forest.</p><p>Dodge?</p><p>There were too many choices.</p><p>“Light!”</p><p>With a single command, his body formed into an element.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou appeared to be motionless, but in fact, he used the high-speed reaction speed brought by the Moment of Enlightenment ability to move in a superb manner.</p><p>One breath, three breaths, ten breaths…</p><p>He intentionally put the second awakening to the test and didn’t use his light ability.</p><p>Even so, after tens of thousands of lashes, the Dragon Apricot Spirit’s demeanor turned from calm to anger, and then to shock, but it did not manage</p><p>to hit the target.</p><p>Before the experiment came to an end, Xu Xiaoshou rolled back and forth 365 times under a thin branch. Finally, he stretched out his foot and let it receive a hit.</p><p>“Middle!”</p><p>“It’s in the middle!”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot was very happy as if it had achieved something great.</p><p>However, when it landed, the human boy’s afterimage on the distant wasteland had long disappeared.</p><p>In the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, Xu Xiaoshou ran off somewhere and brought out a bucket of dragon blood. He flung it in front of Dragon Apricot and then walked away without a backward glance..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
