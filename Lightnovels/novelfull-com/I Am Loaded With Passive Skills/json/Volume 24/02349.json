Feng Yujin’s voice did not have time to pass on the message to MO MO before it came out of the mouth. “I really hate the Spell Forbidden Barrier. Can I pull them out of its range to fight?”</p><p>“You mean…” Xu Xiaoshou turned to look and was moved by his imagination.</p><p>“We’ll take action after fishing out the entire Ran Ming Ruins and the Black Water Stream.” MO MO relayed, “Otherwise, there would still be that slut…it’s very easy for us to get into trouble with that Hallmaster Dao.”</p><p>The little ferret looked over in shock.</p><p>“Is this the plan that I can hear? I don’t even dare to think about it!” It thought.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was deep in thought.</p><p>The power of a Holy Emperor could be seen from how the Abyss Island’s Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, smashed the Fallen Abyss with the Ghost City of the Netherworld.</p><p>Feng Yujin’s words were not a fantasy. If he planned it, perhaps he could really do it?</p><p>“It’s fine. Lord Shou has the God-Slaying Token.”</p><p>The Little Frost Ferret saw the hesitation in Lord Shou’s eyes and explained in time. “Holding the God-Slaying Token is like inheriting Ran Ming’s will. You will not be trapped by the Black Water Stream’s Spell Forbidden Barrier. This is one of the reasons why I could occasionally come out to take a breather.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath.</p><p>He then thought of the god slayer’s so-called “God-Slaying Power “, which was even stronger than the power of the ancestral source and could destroy it.</p><p>It seemed that the god slayer really didn’t care about that mere Spell Forbidden Barrier.</p><p>“The world is big, there are all kinds of strange things,” MO MO also sighed in a low voice. She understood the impact of the plan. Following Xu Xiaoshou, she could always understand that the sky was higher and the earth was wider.</p><p>“Where’s the God-Slaying Token?” MO MO asked again. This time, she was obviously repeating Feng Yujin’s question.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou subconsciously wanted to take out the God-Slaying Token from the Apricot Realm. He felt an inexplicable palpitation.</p><p>He paused, “Why do I have a bad feeling?”</p><p>“What kind of bad feeling?” MO MO and Chief Han asked at the same time. Even now, Feng Yujin did not dare to underestimate Xu Xiaoshou’s ability.</p><p>“I can’t describe it…” Xu Xiaoshou frowned, but he couldn’t find anything. He took out a God-Slaying Token that was half the height of a human and handed it to Mo Mo.</p><p>“Take this thing. Spell Forbidden Barrier is almost useless against me. They can’t withstand my abilities.”</p><p>“If you have the God-Slaying Token, it’s very likely that Hallmaster Dao can trace it back to you. After all, they also have the God-Slaying Token, and their Divine Secret is extremely strange.”</p><p>“This trip is extremely dangerous. If necessary, Feng Yujin, keep an eye on them. Don’t hide. If you meet a demi-saint, kill them immediately. If you can’t kill them, don’t be delayed, understand?”</p><p>“I hope this isn’t a curse,” Feng Yujin sneered.</p><p>MO MO hugged the God-Slaying Token that was half a person tall, and her figure looked even smaller.</p><p>How could this be called a God-Slaying Token? It was more like a God-Slaying Shield…Mo MO muttered silently as she examined the token.</p><p>Apart from being huge, the God-Slaying Token was nothing unusual or magical. It was just an ordinary thing with spiritual power.</p><p>It seemed to be tilting slightly in a certain direction?</p><p>“Lord Shou, I-I… What about me?” The Frost Ferret felt wronged.</p><p>“You’ll have to work hard. If you encounter danger, run away. If you can’t escape, look for me. But you have to lead the way.” As Xu Xiaoshou spoke, his second true body appeared beside him.</p><p>He was very decisive. Somehow, he felt that time was tight, so he followed his sixth sense and quickly assigned tasks.</p><p>“This is my clone, Jin Ren. Jin Ren, you will follow Elder Han, and MO MO to the Ran Ming Ruins.”</p><p>“I have other arrangements. If there is a need, I will ask Elder Han through Jin</p><p>Ren…”</p><p>“Just call me Little Han.” The little ferret raised its paw and said weakly.</p><p>“Alright, ask Little Han. You only need to answer when the time comes.”</p><p>“Remember, as long as something happens, or if someone is held back, and the situation is so serious that even Feng Yujin can’t handle it, Jin Ren will do his best to protect you all.”</p><p>“So even if he wants to self-destruct, don’t look back. Don’t worry about him, understand?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at MO MO as he said the last sentence.</p><p>MO MO was stunned for a moment before she nodded and turned to look at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Jin Ren was no longer dressed like a guard.</p><p>He was currently dressed like Lord Shou from Saint Servant to attract attention. He tilted his head and looked at MO Mo.</p><p>MO MO retracted her gaze.</p><p>“Sigh.”</p><p>A sigh suddenly came from her body.</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand, and a Space Dao Disc appeared under Jin Ren’s feet. Then, he disappeared from where he was, along with the rest.</p><p>Teleportation after teleportation.</p><p>After all, they didn’t know the exact space node of the Black Water Stream, so they could only rely on Elder Han to guide them.</p><p>When he used the last Great Spatial Shift, time seemed to have shifted.</p><p>MO MO and Feng Yujin landed first and went to the Black Water Stream. Jin Ren asked Elder Han coldly,</p><p>“Where is the Qilin?”</p><p>The Little Frost Ferret was stunned and opened its mouth as if it wanted to confirm something. It recalled the instructions it had received from Lord Shou and hurriedly replied,</p><p>“Vermilion Bird Range, below the Vermilion Bird Golden Pagoda.” “I sensed its aura there, but it ignored me. Lord Shou…Good luck.” The little ferret trembled as it spoke, unable to form a sentence.</p><p>As expected!</p><p>It knew this matter wasn’t that simple!</p><p>Back when it had brought 10,000 void crystals out of the Inner Island of the Abyss Island, the mission had been very normal. Who would have thought that it had almost lost its life after that?</p><p>The Four Symbols Secret Realm was not just the Ran Ming Ruins.</p><p>Lord Shou’s real mission was to find that Qilin. What was he going to do?</p><p>This was not important…</p><p>The problem was that this was yet another Holy Emperor game?</p><p>“Vermilion Bird Range, Vermilion Bird Golden Pagoda?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s original body landed in the wilderness. Through the space nodes, he analyzed that he should be in the west of the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>This place was too big.</p><p>It was dozens of times larger than Yunlun Mountain Range.</p><p>The west should be the White Tiger Range, and the Vermilion Bird Range should be in the southeast.</p><p>“Would that flamboyant Elder Dao really not know where the Qilin is?”</p><p>“If not, which demi-saint is guarding the Vermilion Bird Golden Pagoda?”</p><p>Beep.</p><p>A surprised voice came from the Heavenly Group’s communicator.</p><p>“Array eye no. 1, Ao Sheng’s clone in position. That female voice has appeared again. She said…”</p><p>‘ ‘The location of the God-Slaying Token has been sensed,’ and ‘the location of the God-Slaying Token has been locked’.”</p><p>“The target has appeared.. What’s next?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
