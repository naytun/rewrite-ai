He subconsciously dodged to the side.</p><p>“Pan Xian Ax, The Beginning of Chaos!”</p><p>The Old Woodcutter shouted and slashed horizontally with his axe as he faced the saint calamity</p><p>There was an invasion of light from the axe.</p><p>Heaven and Earth shone brightly.</p><p>The space split into two.</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>Fangfang, who had already avoided the critical attack that was aimed at his neck, blacked out. The armor on his left chest was ripped apart, and he spat out blood.</p><p>The Cang God Armor activated on its own and absorbed most of the power of the blow from the Pan Xian Ax.</p><p>Fangfang seemed to have been picked up and flung away. He was knocked back by the force of the axe.</p><p>“Bang bang bang…”</p><p>It wasn’t until he smashed into a mountain several miles away and destroyed half of the mountain that his momentum weakened.</p><p>“Help, me .</p><p>Fangfang struggled to call for help in the Heavenly Group’s battle channel. He subconsciously wanted to release his spiritual source to relieve the pain in his body. Even if it was only to form a spiritual energy barrier, but he forcefully killed this thought.</p><p>The slash from the Pan Xian Ax might not necessarily kill him.</p><p>However, if he released his spiritual source aura and was locked onto by the saint calamity, he would definitely die without a burial place!</p><p>“Not dead?”</p><p>On the Black Tortoise Golden Tower, Cen Qiaofu sensed that there was still life in the distance, and his eyes flashed with shock.</p><p>This new Combat Division Chief’s body was extraordinary…</p><p>NO!</p><p>It should be said that the Cang God Armor was too powerful!</p><p>According to the Chief, if Teng Shanhai had not been tricked by Xu Xiaoshou on Abyss Island and forced into a corner by Jiang Buyi, he would have been able to dispel the power of the ancestral source that had gone out of control.</p><p>Demi-saint Jiang Buyi would not have been able to break through the defense of the Cang God Armor so easily and tear Teng Shanhai apart.</p><p>Thus, Cen Qiaofu temporarily set aside all thoughts about the new Chief of the Combat Division and turned to look at Wang Dachui’s retreating figure. He didn’t waste any words and raised the small axe in his hand.</p><p>“Pan Xian Ax, Yin Yang Splitting Dawn!”</p><p>With a whoosh, a streak of golden light flashed out.</p><p>Under the axe, the sky was devoid of light and shadow and dropped from darkness into the endless darkness of hell.</p><p>“F* ck! Why don’t you go and f*ck him, what do you want with me?” Wang Dachui was irritated, but he didn’t dare to delay.</p><p>“Eight Doors!”</p><p>His eyes suddenly turned red, and his short body suddenly expanded. Eight light spots lit up on his acupuncture points. It was if he wanted to seize a ray of light amid this endless darkness.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>Wang Dachui knew that it was useless to dodge, so he used all his strength to smash his hammer outward.</p><p>He couldn’t even see where the axe light was going to slash at on his body. He could only rely on his senses to defend against all the vital points in front of him.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The axe light struck the Hammer of Thorns.</p><p>Wang Dachui’s body was only stuck on the spot for a moment before his arm exploded with a bang. Blood splattered everywhere as his body was blasted back by several dozen feet.</p><p>If Cen Qiaofu was still a higher void, he would have been able to block this attack.</p><p>But he had undergone sanctification!</p><p>The axe carried a faint Holy Power and the lightning effect of the saint calamity made Wang Dachui, who did not dare to use any spiritual source and could only use his physical strength to take the blow, feel that he could not resist it.</p><p>“I will die!”</p><p>“I will definitely die!”</p><p>“I cannot continue to receive his attacks. Otherwise, I will really die here today…”</p><p>After Wang Dachui withdrew his body to reduce the force, he turned around and ran.</p><p>He was much more experienced than a young man like Fangfang. His life was at stake. The mission to guard the Black Tortoise Golden Tower had failed.</p><p>After he got back and apologized, Hallmaster Dao would not blame him for not being able to withstand the attack of the higher void Cen Qiaofu who had undergone sanctification and his escape due to fear.</p><p>Even a higher void couldn’t catch the mad dog Cen Qiaofu!</p><p>However, as soon as he turned around, the thunderous sound of the saint calamity exploded in his ears. Cen Qiaofu appeared at his side and swung his axe at his head.</p><p>Wang Dachui cursed in fear and his bloodshot eyes were filled with ruthlessness. He raised his hammer to block him off slightly, gritted his teeth, and gathered all his strength to kick.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>The Pan Xian Ax smashed downward. Wang Dachui, whose Eight Doors were open blocked it with his hammer. The handle of the hammer cracked.</p><p>The shoulder bones on his left and right arms cracked.</p><p>This time, if he hadn’t opened the Eight Doors in advance, he, Wang Dachui, would most likely have lost both his arms, and even half of his body would have been chopped off by Cen Qiaofu!</p><p>When he received the blow from the axe, Wang Dachui used offense to defend, and he kicked hard at Cen Qiaofu’s chin.</p><p>“Raise your jaw!”</p><p>It was useless to defend.</p><p>If the enemy’s combat strength was stronger than his, then to defend would be equivalent to waiting for death.</p><p>Only this kick could give him a chance to live.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>He used the power of the Eight Doors ancient martial arts to lift up his jaw. However, before Cen Qiaofu could regain his strength, he was kicked in the chin.</p><p>With a bang, Wang Dachui clearly saw Cen Qiaofu’s head fly out.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>He was delighted.</p><p>How could a mortal body withstand an attack from the Eight Doors ancient martial arts?</p><p>Cen Qiaofu was too arrogant!</p><p>Did he really think that he was invincible after he underwent sanctification?</p><p>“I am the one who’s invincible!”</p><p>After he kicked Cen Qiaofu’s head away, Wang Dachui flipped in the air, rotated his shoulders and adjusted his broken shoulder blades to their original position.</p><p>He still did not dare to use his spiritual source.</p><p>However, he had done a thorough research on the human body. With the help of the energy that was squeezed out of the acupuncture points through acupoint stimulation, he quickly healed the injuries on his arms.</p><p>The headless Cen Qiaofu was petrified on the spot..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
