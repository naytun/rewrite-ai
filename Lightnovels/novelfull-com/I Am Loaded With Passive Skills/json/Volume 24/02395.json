From the Acquired Stage to the Spiritual</p><p>Cultivator and those who had just entered the path of cultivation, to demi-saints and the Holy Emperor, everything was possible and everything</p><p>was there.</p><p>The Star Scroll had brought absolute fairness to everyone in the world.</p><p>One could choose to recite and risk his life for the opportunity.</p><p>Naturally, he could also refuse.</p><p>Wu Rao Emperor Realm.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was dressed in a luxurious robe inlaid with gold and jade. He held a divine Sinan in his hand, and the star dipper spun slowly. He looked calm and relaxed.</p><p>He looked down at the impassable barrier between the Holy Emperor secret realm and the Shengshen Continent-the Stairway to Heaven.</p><p>He looked up and saw a beam of divine light that descended from outside the Wu Rao Emperor Realm, as if it wanted to take him to an unknown place.</p><p>“Weng…”</p><p>The divine light fell, and it was close at hand.</p><p>However, he was isolated by the power of the world of the Wu Rao Emperor Realm and it could not break in.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang slowly extended his hand. Through a barrier, he seemed to have touched the divine light of the stars.</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>He smiled and waited until the power of the divine light was exhausted and shattered before his eyes. Then, he shook his head gently and muttered to himself.</p><p>“God-Slaving power?”</p><p>“Sorry, I don’t need it.”</p><p>Vermilion Bird Golden Tower.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had waited at this site for a long time.</p><p>Jin Ren’s mission was to explore the Ran Ming Ruins.</p><p>In reality, it was just a cannon fodder mission. He would go out and attract the Fire Power and draw away the attention of the elites of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>There was no doubt that Jin Ren had done a great job!</p><p>He pulled Feng Yujin and he borrowed Cen Qiaofu’s force.</p><p>The Ran Ming ruins had attracted the attention of Beibei, Wei Feng, Yue Gongli, Ai Cangsheng and even Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>As for Ao Sheng and the other stinky fish and shrimps, Jin Ren was able to deal with them by himself. Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even need to pay any attention to them.</p><p>However, to the Saint Servant and the First Pavilion in the Sky, the most important mission of the Four Symbols Secret Realm was not the Ran Ming ruins, but the Qilin!</p><p>Yes, Xu Xiaoshou’s main body wasn’t here just to work for the Saint Servant.</p><p>He thought that if it was possible, the best place for the Qilin would be to go to the First Pavilion in the Sky instead of entering the Saint Servant that had no future.</p><p>“But now it seems…”</p><p>“The inheritance of the god slayer is a little too attractive!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked up and saw the Star Scroll in the sky.</p><p>The power contained within it was probably even more powerful than the Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict that Bazhun’an had used before .</p><p>Even something as terrifying as the Arrow of Evil God could be easily shattered by the god slayer’s will, that was only the phantom of an axe.</p><p>One could imagine that the God -Slaying power was able to slash the power of the ancestral source. It was not just a legend.</p><p>However, Jin Ren had already been dragged into it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou would not have sent him to the Ran Ming ruins so quickly.</p><p>He thought that he would let Jin Ren scout around first. If there was danger, he would not go. If there was really a chance to obtain the God -Slaying power, he would just mutter that name and gain entry. With regards to this point, Jin Ren naturally agreed.</p><p>Back to the present.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had stared at the beautiful figure on the Vermilion Bird Golden Tower for a long time.</p><p>He had made thorough preparations. He even thought that he would confront a demi-saint. However, he had never expected that the person who guarded the Vermilion Bird Golden Tower would be Little Yu- Yu Zhiwen!</p><p>“It seems that Dao Qiongcang doesn’t know about the Qilin’s existence.</p><p>Otherwise, there would be at least a Holy Emperor here…”</p><p>The past was like yesterday.</p><p>The inexperienced Little Yu in the White Cave had already shed her childishness.</p><p>She no longer covered her face with a veil and feared to show it to others.</p><p>She seemed to have matured a lot and was also much more confident.</p><p>As she stood at the top of the tower, the breeze caressed her skirt. It brought out the crisp sound of the accessories that hung from her waist and outlined her exquisite figure.</p><p>The light of the Galaxy shone down on her smooth and jade-like skin and accentuated her exquisite side profile and her snow-white neck.</p><p>The trial-takers of the Four Symbols Secret Realm had fought to the death in the Golden Tower of the other three lineages.</p><p>Only when everyone arrived at the Vermilion Bird Golden Tower did their footsteps become softer.</p><p>When he looked up, he saw that everything in the world was beautiful.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen raised her head slightly and looked at the Galaxy. The stars were under her long and curly eyelashes, and her attraction to the deep world was reflected in her eyes.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also raised his head slightly to look at the beautiful figure at the top of the tower. Many images flashed through his mind. He knew that memories would only solidify the good, so he smiled gently at the thoughts of the past.</p><p>She did not call out that name.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t say anything.</p><p>In the Apricot Realm, the Frost Ferret looked at the screen of the Four Symbols Secret Realm and said loudly.</p><p>“This is the place!”</p><p>“The position under this woman’s feet is where one uses consciousness to communicate… I came into contact with the Qilin’s consciousness here last time.”</p><p>“As for her… Lord Shou, should we get rid of this woman first?”</p><p>“That’s not necessary.” Xu Xiaoshou laughed.</p><p>He knew that apart from the Divine Secret, Yu Zhiwen’s overall combat strength was very low. She might not even be comparable to Ao Sheng.</p><p>Of course, he could not rule out the possibility that the trip to the White Cave had given him enough misconceptions.</p><p>However, it was impossible to solve it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried it out. He secretly threw out a portrait clone of himself among the trial-takers and quickly shattered it.</p><p>On the top of the Vermilion Bird Golden Tower, Yu Zhiwen blinked and looked down as if she had sensed something.</p><p>She seemed to be searching for something. Soon, she frowned and muttered.</p><p>“I am having illusions again….”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
