It completely combined all kinds of power in his body and played a central role.</p><p>It came just in time!</p><p>Not only was the appearance of the Dragon Pearl a pleasant surprise, but after he received the power of the Dragon Ancestor, the greatest breakthrough was actually when he became a dragon!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou only needed one thought.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>In the Apricot Realm, a five-claw true dragon covered in pure gold appeared in the midst of the clouds. It was coiled in the air and had an extraordinary aura.</p><p>Through the judgment and comparison of the Perception, other than its size being inferior to the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, its appearance, aura, and potential… They were not much weaker than the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>“The Dragon Ancestor’s true body is this noble scarlet- gold color?” “Precious Dragon will fall in love with me when it sees me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was very satisfied with his appearance.</p><p>With a thought, he reverted to his human form again and deliberately disappeared. He speeded up the time and put on his clothes.</p><p>In this way, he gave people the impression that he was extremely outstanding after his dragon transformation and was refined and courteous after he recovered. He was not ashamed to show the others.</p><p>The expected collision of the power of the Dragon Ancestor and the power of the Heavenly Ancestor did not happen.</p><p>On the contrary, both the powers of the ancestral source in his body were in a one-sided Force. The power of the Dragon Ancestor was restrained and did not dare to resist at all.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou thought about it, he felt relieved.</p><p>After all, the power of the Dragon Ancestor was only obtained after he swallowed 99 Dragon Apricot fruits. It was still weak and needed to be nurtured like the sword cognition.</p><p>The Heavenly Ancestor Legacy came from the spirit of the Heavenly Ancestor of Abyss Island. It was infused with the power of one of the Ten Ancestors from the Eight Classics, and its energy was terrifyingly vast.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s passive skills were still unable to digest the power of the Heavenly Ancestor. It was very evident that its quality and quantity were extraordinary.</p><p>How could he dare to act rashly when he could obtain the power from a mere 99 Dragon Apricot fruits?</p><p>Even so, Xu Xiaoshou felt that after he manifested the dragon scale armor, it would not be a problem for him to fight Jiang Buyi with his Extended Passive Skill.</p><p>He finally dared to claim that he was a demi-saint and dared to take on the Eight Classics while he was still in the Sovereign Dao Realm!</p><p>It was not like before, where he could not keep up with the battle consciousness or only dared to compete with some ordinary weak demi-saints.</p><p>“Success!”</p><p>After he digested all the power and comprehension, Xu Xiaoshou looked at his second true body, whose eyes were filled with envy.</p><p>“You…” To be honest, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t bear to do it.</p><p>“Kill me!” This time, the second true body happily closed its eyes and did not beg.</p><p>He was Xu Xiaoshou, and Xu Xiaoshou was him.</p><p>He saw that his main body had become stronger after he used the points and ate the fruits.</p><p>Just now, even the speed of the Saint Seeds on All Five Fingers technique was reduced to dregs in an instant.</p><p>At the thought of this, the second true body couldn’t hold it in anymore.</p><p>Just like how Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t accept how weak he was, the second true body couldn’t accept that when compared to the original body, he was trash.</p><p>Before the Apricot Realm, after the Apricot Realm.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s progress had changed greatly, and he could see that the original body was much better than his second true body.</p><p>“Endure it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t say much. He happily slashed his second true body, then clasped his head and absorbed the pain.</p><p>He did not feel as if he had killed someone, but rather, he had committed suicide…</p><p>After the pain abated, Xu Xiaoshou started to create a new being. This left the Dragon Apricot Spirit dumbfounded.</p><p>With a whoosh, a brand-new half-dressed Jin Ren appeared.</p><p>“I am invincible!” This time, Jin Ren appeared with a smile on his lips.</p><p>“It’s still the same as before. You’re Jin Ren. Don’t mess around. We’ll put on a show to scare others. If necessary, we’ll let you put on a show.” Xu Xiaoshou threw him a new set of clothes.</p><p>“I have a question.” Jin Ren agreed happily because he knew that he would be able to have a longer life span this time.</p><p>His passive skills were basically all at the Holy Emperor Lv.0.</p><p>The remaining two master-type passive skills, even if he used them, he would obtain the path principle comprehension.</p><p>As for the comprehension, the main body and the second true body could share their thoughts.</p><p>In other words, at this moment, the original body had almost restored all of Jin Ren’s strength, except for external objects and external forces.</p><p>Even if he used his Passive Points to level up the remaining two Expertise Passive Skills, he would not have to die again.</p><p>Of course, he could live a longer life!</p><p>“Then…” Xu Xiaoshou smiled as he looked at Jin Ren.</p><p>After he dressed himself, he took on the role of a guard and said solemnly.</p><p>“You can go out and cause trouble.”</p><p>The Apricot Realm opened up a passage to the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>In the outside world, this phenomenon was also known as the arrival of an extra dimensional space.</p><p>“Right now, we’re like two evil ghost beasts. You can transform into a dragon, and I can transform into an Ultimate Giant and cause a lot of problems.” Jin Ren stepped into the crack.</p><p>“It seems to be true? We’re at least at the king level of the ghost beast, dragons and giants…” Xu Xiaoshou laughed.</p><p>“We can also rope in Greedy the Cat Spirit and enlarge his size. He can swallow the great array of the Jade Capital City, or use the Three Tribulation Eyes to summon the divine calamity as our backup. Then, we can use our Drawing Expertise to draw a sound system and play some background music. We’ll be the evil trio!”</p><p>“Interesting. Do you want to try?”</p><p>“Forget it. It would scare Aunt Xiang.”</p><p>“That’s true… What a magical feeling. Back then, Feng Yujin walked out of the White Cave with this kind of feeling, right?” Xu Xiaoshou felt that this conversation was like his inner voice being magnified.</p><p>“No, Young Master. He even defeated a group of the red-clothed people back then. I wonder how many of those red-clothed people from the White Cave are still alive. How nostalgic!”</p><p>“Speaking of which, it had been a long while since I last saw Night Guardian…”</p><p>“Yeah, I did not see him on Abyss Island. I wonder if he died under the Nine</p><p>Death Thunder Calamity” “That’s a great pity.”</p><p>“It’s a pity, but we did our best.”</p><p>“Yes, he’s not a good person, but he’s quite alright.”</p><p>“That was a very high compliment. You really know how to talk.”</p><p>“You too..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
