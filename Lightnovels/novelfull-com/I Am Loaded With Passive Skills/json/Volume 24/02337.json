You get worked up so easily!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up. He had gauged Little Hua Ying’s personality correctly and that was why he dared to be so aggressive.</p><p>Since the Holy Palace envoy dared to attack him today, he would gain the public’s sympathy.</p><p>As long as he could withstand one strike and not die, the Holy Palace would send its people to keep an eye on him and ensure his safety.</p><p>Once the Holy Palace Trial ended and Xu Gusheng suddenly died, anyone would think that it was because he had offended the Holy Palace envoy, right?</p><p>Then the problem would be…</p><p>Could the sickly young master Xu Gusheng withstand the Holy Palace envoy Hua Ying’s attack?</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou could come up with this logic, the old foxes from the Holy Palace naturally would understand as well.</p><p>However, this ‘stop’ seemed to be merely for show. It was just a voice, and not</p><p>many people came forward to stop the attack.</p><p>In reality, the Holy Palace Trial had always encountered people who wanted to find fault with them. It was impossible to reason with these people. They would always find unexpected thorns.</p><p>And this time round, it was normal to meet people who tried to stir up trouble with the emergence of the Ran Ming ruins.</p><p>There were many talented people in the Holy Palace. They had their own reasons when they chose Hua Ying as the envoy.</p><p>There were people in the Golden Phoenix Square who were shocked, and there were also people who were sharp-eyed and responsive.</p><p>However, without exception, no one reached out to help.</p><p>Anyone who could get into the upper elites of a big faction could see that Xu Gusheng was just a toy on the surface, a cannon fodder who could talk well.</p><p>The person who secretly competed with the Holy Palace was the person who hid in the dark and would launch an attack at some unknown time.</p><p>That was the big shot!</p><p>When Hua Ying pounced on the sickly young master with the cauldron, she saw the panicked look on the young master’s face.</p><p>In addition, she did not wait for the protectors of the Holy Palace to stop her. She was acutely aware that something was wrong.</p><p>This was very similar to what her Supreme Master had said before about some evil scheme that she had forgotten.</p><p>It didn’t matter if she couldn’t figure it out. She relied on her sixth sense as a woman and Hua Ying subconsciously held back a little, lest she really let her anger get to her head and kill him on the spot.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The cauldron hit him on the head.</p><p>The moment it made contact, a violent explosion sounded in the void.</p><p>The ground shook and cracked. The moment the spiritual array was triggered, it instantly shattered.</p><p>This was a little too exaggerated!</p><p>Hua Ying, who held the cauldron, was stunned.</p><p>She knew that she had only used 30% of her strength.</p><p>Moreover, she had restrained her power. It was impossible for even half of it to leak out at all and affect the others in the square.</p><p>However, she saw a terrifying wave of air explode in front of her eyes that caused the Golden Phoenix Square to flip over.</p><p>After the sickly young master was hit, the guard who had helped him slap the other person disappeared. He let out a cry of pain and flew backward.</p><p>An eye-catching line of blood streaked across the air.</p><p>From the inside to the outside of the square, Young Master Xu with his hands clasped over his head, created a passageway as he bowled over numerous people during his flight.</p><p>In the end, the sickly young master smashed into a fruit stall on the side of the street outside the square. His force halted only after he landed on and crushed all the fruits.</p><p>“Murder!”</p><p>“The Holy Palace envoy is out to kill someone!”</p><p>“The place where the Saints were nurtured in the past no longer exists. The current Holy Palace is controlled by the five great authorities. They deliberately confused the right from the wrong; there is no doubt about it!”</p><p>“They don’t even give people a chance to ask questions. If you dare to tell the truth, you will be beaten to death!”</p><p>While everyone in the square were shocked by the sudden accident, many passers-by gathered from all directions and shouted out these chilling words at the same time..</p><p>The elites of the various major factions were terrified when they heard these direct accusations.</p><p>The people from the Holy Palace felt their visions turn black. This was a huge scandal that involved them!</p><p>However, when they turned around and tried to find the person who spoke, the virtual portrait clones controlled by someone had long disappeared.</p><p>“This d*mned fellow…” Hua Ying gritted her teeth so hard that she almost broke them. She gripped the alchemy cauldron tightly and was so angry that her delicate body shivered violently.</p><p>That storm that smashed through the crowd was not caused by her!</p><p>It was impossible that the power of her attack could hurt the innocent and injure the others in the square!</p><p>Everything…</p><p>It must be that Xu Gusheng who was the director and actor!</p><p>Hua Ying regretted her action. She should have smashed that d*mn brat to death.</p><p>But regret was useless.</p><p>Hua Ying’s eyes hardened. Why not take this opportunity to wash away her regret?</p><p>She followed her thoughts. She suddenly lifted the alchemy cauldron again and wanted to rush over and put Xu Gusheng into the alchemy cauldron to shut him up forever.</p><p>A voice sounded in her mind.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>This was the voice of the Holy Palace protectors.</p><p>“But…” Hua Ying still struggled mentally.</p><p>“Don’t worry. The rumors won’t hurt the Holy Palace. The representatives of the major factions are all smart. They can tell that Xu Gusheng is just putting on an act that they would not dare to follow.”</p><p>Hua Ying could only sigh and felt that it was a pity. Finally, she glared at Xu Gusheng, who had collapsed amid the fruit stall, and turned around to return to the high platform.</p><p>The Holy Palace had too much dignity!</p><p>Even if Xu Gusheng had directed and acted to this extent, who would dare to agree with him verbally? At such a sensitive juncture before the start of the trial, he chose to offend the Holy Palace?</p><p>None of the tens of thousands of people in the square had noticed that the wild storm and the roars were only the prelude to the disruption of the situation.</p><p>“What a good Holy Palace!”</p><p>“Do you really want to kill and silence me? I didn’t say anything treacherous or unreasonable….”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
