This was such a surprise.</p><p>What was odd was how they managed to activate the ‘point’? Was there someone behind them?</p><p>“You go.”</p><p>“You go first!”</p><p>“I’ll let you go ahead. After all, I owe you a favor last time.”</p><p>“F*ck, then I won’t stand on ceremony. I can play with these two girls for a month!”</p><p>A thin man finally couldn’t hold back the lust in his heart and swaggered over. He stretched out his hand and placed it on Yingying’s shoulder. He even wanted to lift Qiao’er’s chin.</p><p>“Where did you two ladies come from? Follow me and I’ll bring you to a good place…”</p><p>Weng!</p><p>The teleportation array moved again.</p><p>The thin man who had a red hunting token suspended from his waist retreated quickly. He realized that the actual owner had arrived.</p><p>It was still too fast just now…</p><p>But this time, the one who appeared in the teleportation portal was a sickly young master who looked so delicate and weak that it seemed he would collapse with one push!</p><p>He stood in the hall.</p><p>The pale face that seemed to have just recovered from an illness almost lit up the entire dark hall.</p><p>It was really bright!</p><p>In the hall, half of the killers stared at him, and some of their eyes turned slightly red.</p><p>“Top-grade! ”</p><p>“Compared to him, these two girls are trash!”</p><p>“No realm, no vicious aura. If you’re not a Hidden master, then you’re totally useless…”</p><p>How dare this cripple appear at the Saint Killer Hall?</p><p>Even so, there were always people who would place bets and had high hopes. After all, he really looked like a piece of trash. His cultivation level could not be detected by any means.</p><p>“White Wolf, did this sickly young master scare you? If it’s me, I can’t stand it!” “There’s something wrong with him…”</p><p>“For the sake of beautiful women, I’m willing to die!” If I were in his shoes, I can enjoy myself for three months.”</p><p>“F*ck! I have to feel good first!”</p><p>The man with the red hunting token who had struck up a conversation earlier cursed softly and walked forward again.</p><p>When Yingying and Qiao’er saw the man who strode over again, they instantly froze and their delicate bodies trembled violently.</p><p>The people here were all like them; they all wore masks. Some were physical, some were illusory…</p><p>But without exception, their violent auras were terrifyingly strong.</p><p>This was something that the spirit concealing masks could not hide!</p><p>It was also the biggest difference between him and the two of them!</p><p>They didn’t need to say anything. With just a glance, Yingying and Qiao’er felt as if they had seen a mountain of corpses amid the Blood Sea. Their legs went weak and they almost fell.</p><p>How could their legs not turn wobbly when they were only at the Innate Stage and entered this den filled with early-stage of Sovereign killers?</p><p>When the killer White Wolf approached them, the only thing Yingying and Qiao’er could do was to get behind young master Xu as they sought a sense of security.</p><p>Fortunately, they were no longer White Wolf’s target.</p><p>In a fit of jealousy, when he arrived in front of the teleportation array, he reached out and lifted the sick young master’s chin.</p><p>“This turtle…”</p><p>“I mean, Young Master!” White Wolf paused for a moment before he corrected himself</p><p>An array of laughter rang out from behind him.</p><p>There were those who were disgusted, those who wanted to watch the show, those who wanted to stop the action halfway, and those who looked forward to the show…</p><p>White Wolf could not suppress the desire in his eyes. He raised his eyebrows and asked, “May I ask what your name is?” “+(Watched, Passive Points+)+365.” “+(Expected, Passive Points,+) +288.”</p><p>“+(Subjected to Fantasy. Passive Points, )+66.”</p><p>The Information Bar jumped.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s head went numb when he saw the last line of ‘Subjected to Fantasy’.</p><p>He once again cursed Bazhun’an…</p><p>However, the Three Incenses had refreshed his understanding time and again.</p><p>This time, the introductory gifts they gave were even more amazing than the gold hunting token killers on the Lone Cliff, in the deep sea, and on Abyss Island!</p><p>I’m really not here to cause trouble…</p><p>But this was really unbearable…</p><p>The sickly young master closed his fan and looked down. He saw the finger that lifted his chin and said in a shocked voice.</p><p>“You want to sleep with me?”</p><p>Yingying and Qiao’er’s heads buzzed. They looked up in shock and looked at Young Master Xu’s good-looking but suddenly disgusting side profile.</p><p>White Wolf’s eyes were fixed intently on him. Then, his lower body trembled, and he opened his mouth and licked his lips.</p><p>“You want to as well?”</p><p>The hall exploded.</p><p>No one would have thought that this sickly young master would be so direct. He actually had such a temperament!</p><p>Not only did he not reject White Wolf, he still played with him?</p><p>“+(Expected. Passive Points,+)165.”</p><p>“+(Disliked. Passive Points, )198.”</p><p>The sickly young master looked around and saw the group of killers who shouted and cheered behind White Wolf. The smile on his face did not diminish. “Who else wants to sleep with me?” Whoosh.</p><p>The crowd behind them became agitated.</p><p>Everyone’s emotions seemed to have been stirred up by an intangible hand, but they were not aware of it.</p><p>“White Wolf, I think you’re in trouble. You can’t beat him!” “Haha, count me in. I’ll join you too.”</p><p>“Hiss, I can’t take it anymore… Count me in! I want it too!”</p><p>“Add me too.”</p><p>“Add one more.”</p><p>“Then you guys go ahead and play. I’ll watch from the side. I’m a pervert.” When the noise reached its peak.</p><p>“Shh.” The sickly young master closed his paper fan and pushed away White Wolf’s finger away from his chin as he shushed the crowd.</p><p>Instantly, everyone fell silent.</p><p>Not only the killers in the hall, but even the servants with low cultivation levels who trembled in fear, felt the pressure suddenly drop.</p><p>“What do you want to do?” White Wolf, whose head was filled with lurid thoughts did not notice anything unusual.</p><p>The killers behind him had already realized that something was wrong.</p><p>This momentum…</p><p>Just this ‘shh’ affected all the killers in the hall, including the higher void.</p><p>This sickly young master was not a simple person!</p><p>That’s right, how could anyone who could come out of the teleportation portal be simple? Why did they not notice this point just now? “White Wolf! Wrong idea, retreat!” Someone shouted.</p><p>White Wolf finally realized something.</p><p>White Wolf who was only at the Cutting Path Stage wanted to pull out and escape, but he felt like he was stuck in a quagmire and it was difficult for him to move.</p><p>“Who are you?” White Wolf panicked. He was caught in the middle of a force, but the person who had unleashed the force did not seem to be the sickly young master in front of him, but someone who was invisible.</p><p>With a swish, the sickly young master swung his tightly closed folding fan, and everyone’s gaze immediately fell on the thick ink characters written on the fan:</p><p>“I am Xu Gusheng!”</p><p>However, before anyone could read out the name, the sickly young master Xu Gusheng’s face turned cold, like the God of Death, who opened the roll. He said coldly. “Jin Ren.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>“Kill all the people present now.”</p><p>“Yes, sir!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
