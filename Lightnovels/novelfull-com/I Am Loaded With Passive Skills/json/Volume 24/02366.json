Cen Qiaofu had not destroyed anything related to the Holy Palace Trial.</p><p>“Senior Cen, I’ve offended you just now. You should know who I am, right?” He sent a telepathic communication across.</p><p>With a bang, Cen Qiaofu was caught off guard and was embedded deep into the ground by the lightning strike. He almost could not withstand this saint calamity.</p><p>He stood up and scanned his surroundings. He was sure that the person who sent the telepathic communication was Yue Gongli. He was so stunned that he couldn’t speak.</p><p>“I’m Yue Gongli, my sister is Yue Gongnu and my brother-in-law is Bazhun’an, who is also our first-in-command saint servant!”</p><p>“When you think of it, I’m also considered half a Saint Servant!”</p><p>Yue Gongli crouched on the mountain peak and watched the Old Woodcutter transcend the tribulation. He used a more intimate tone when he transmitted his telepathic communication.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu was completely stunned.</p><p>Of course, he knew about the complicated relationship between them.</p><p>However, Yue Gongli’s demeanor was the same before Wei An left and after. Why was that?</p><p>Was that for real?</p><p>Or was he pretending?</p><p>Cen Qiaofu didn’t believe it at all, and he became more cautious.</p><p>Yue Gongli rested his chin on his hands, as if he was really interested in his transcend the tribulation. He observed the situation carefully and then transmitted a telepathic communication again.</p><p>“Old senior, there’s only you and me here.”</p><p>“Elder Dao the Flamboyant isn’t here, so it’s even more impossible for anyone to intercept my telepathic communication. You don’t have to worry.”</p><p>“Actually, my brother-in-law told me that your mission was to destroy the various array eyes of the Divine Array, right?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu was shocked.</p><p>He had indeed come with a mission.</p><p>Not only did he have to destroy the various array eyes, but he also had to transcend the tribulation itself to restrain as many people as possible.</p><p>Wang Dachui and Fangfang were just minor characters.</p><p>He could restrain more than one demi-saint during the saint calamity.</p><p>He had to use this opportunity to kill his way from the Black Tortoise lineage to the Ran Mlng ruins and stall everyone he was able to.</p><p>This was just the beginning.</p><p>Of course, the only disadvantage of this was that the more demi-saints the saint calamity targeted, the stronger it would become.</p><p>Even someone as strong as Cen Qiaofu might be struck to death in the midst of the transcend the tribulation.</p><p>However, he still dared to do so because he was already prepared and not just mentally.</p><p>Yue Gongli could tell that this was one of his missions, but Cen Qiaofu was not sure if this man was just messing around or if he was a spy.</p><p>“Didn’t Bazhun’an inform you?” On the mountain top, Yue Gongli saw that the Old Woodcutter was silent. He sighed and said, “Well, that’s just how he is. He didn’t tell Xu Xiaoshou about Abyss Island either. He’s always using people as tools.”</p><p>“What are you trying to say?” Under the saint calamity, Cen Qiaofu asked. His voice was vigorous and filled with energy. It wasn’t a telepathic communication, but rather, it spread out in all directions.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu didn’t believe him!</p><p>How could he be tricked by this fox-face person and reveal everything?</p><p>“Don’t. It’s already like this. You still don’t believe me?”</p><p>“I’m risking my life by going against the law to contact you now. It’s a one-way contact!”</p><p>Yue Gongli didn’t respond directly, but continued to use the telepathic communication.</p><p>“I’ve seen Elder Dao the Flamboyant’s Divine Array Diagram. There are too many array eyes. You won’t be able to destroy all of them.”</p><p>“If you can, you’ve exceeded my expectations… Trust me, the speed of your destruction is not as fast as his reconstruction.” “Once the saint calamity is over, you’ll definitely die!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu began to move.</p><p>He withstood the saint calamity and kept silent. He flew at high speed from the Black Tortoise lineage to the Azure Dragon lineage.</p><p>Wherever it passed, the thunder calamity raged on.</p><p>He didn’t even need to do much damage. As long as he stayed at a certain place, it would be reduced to powder by the saint calamity.</p><p>Sometimes, the entire mountain was shattered.</p><p>Sometimes, the mountain peak was not affected and the Divine Array would strike out and explode into starlight that filled the sky.</p><p>“Tsk tsk…” Yue Gongli shook his head and followed him.</p><p>He did not use his Holy Power and kept his aura hidden to the lowest level.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu could tell that he didn’t want to fight, and he himself didn’t want to provoke this demi-saint from the Cold Palace Emperor Realm.</p><p>Anyway, this guy was right in front of him. Whether it was talking or fighting, he couldn’t get away to do anything else.</p><p>With him in front, the red and white clothed people behind him could only wait.</p><p>The restraint had already begun!</p><p>Yue Gongli didn’t care if he was restrained or not. Maybe he really wanted to be restrained. He just followed him around and squatted and chirped like a sparrow.</p><p>“Old Senior, believe me, it’s true!”</p><p>“If you do this, once the saint calamity is over, not even Bazhun’an will be able to save you.”</p><p>“Elder Dao the Flamboyant would be forced to kill you because you’ve stood out in public. If you don’t die, the reputation of Hallmaster Dao will be greatly damaged.”</p><p>“This time, the Holy Divine Palace dispatched a lot of people. When the time comes, Elder Dao the Flamboyant can directly claim your semi-saint person.”</p><p>“The Holy Divine Palace, ha…”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu turned a deaf ear.</p><p>His speed was very fast. He was about to cross the entire Black Tortoise lineage and approach the Black Water Stream where the Ran Ming ruins were located.</p><p>Outside the area covered by the saint calamity, there were groups of red and white clothed people who stood some distance away.</p><p>Once any trial-taker was swept into the midst of the saint calamity, a magical light shield would appear above their heads.</p><p>Once the light shield appeared, the person would be teleported away and then sent elsewhere to undergo the trial, even if the two teams were engaged in an intense life-and-death battle..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
