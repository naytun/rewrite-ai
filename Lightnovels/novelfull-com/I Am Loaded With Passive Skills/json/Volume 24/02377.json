He held onto the Yama’s Banquet and stopped in mid-air.</p><p>MO MO returned to her physical form from her gray fog state and felt pain at her waist.</p><p>She reached out and wiped her waist with her torn dress. It left a bloody mark…</p><p>Penetrating Divine Senses, the ultimate power!</p><p>This best way to deal with this kind of power was to use all kinds of Element Body. This was apart from the Seal Body fog that could not even be considered an Element Body.</p><p>When he saw the blood between her fingers, Feng Yujin was speechless.</p><p>“Ah, this…</p><p>He shook MO Mo’s hand and explained numbly.</p><p>“Little girl, don’t misunderstand!”</p><p>“It’s really not that I could not dodge it and deliberately let you get injured.”</p><p>“This saber was indeed a little violent. It looks very much like Bazhun’an… Bazhun’an’s sword cognition.</p><p>Sizzle…</p><p>A large amount of blood suddenly spurted out from MO Mo’s waist and dyed her white dress red.</p><p>She was stunned. Soon, her eyelashes started to quiver from the pain.</p><p>“Feng Yujin, I’m injured…”</p><p>“Uhh.” The grey mist figure behind her trembled and could no longer say anything. “I’m sorry, I am sorry…”</p><p>“He’s very powerful. He’s stronger than those before, isn’t he?” MO MO interrupted his apology and her voice was back to normal.</p><p>“Of course!” Feng Yujin was delighted. This little girl was still willing to talk and that was a good thing!</p><p>“Can you defeat him in your peak condition?”</p><p>“Bullshit! I’m a Holy Emperor, he’s just a mere demi- saint! Who are you looking down on?”</p><p>“What about now?”</p><p>“Uh… Uh… The main thing was that he wasn’t a Spiritual Cultivator… You were not mature enough yet…”</p><p>“I understand.”</p><p>MO MO was smart. She knew that when Feng Yujin lost his confidence and started to beat around the bush, it meant that he couldn’t do it.</p><p>She didn’t know who Wei Feng was or what level he was at.</p><p>In any case, according to Feng Yujin, other than the Holy Emperor and Bazhun’an, anyone else was considered not worthy.</p><p>MO MO was used to this arrogance.</p><p>She had also gone from being silent the moment the battle started to being able to chat with Feng Yujin even while he was in a fight.</p><p>Because the battle belonged to Feng Yujin.</p><p>She was just a vessel, or rather, a medium. Her only responsibility was to watch.</p><p>The battle would end soon.</p><p>It was like a huge matter that would pass after a night’s sleep.</p><p>This kind of state felt very uncomfortable initially. After all, she was watching her own body fight in an unfamiliar way.</p><p>But later on, it gradually became a daily routine, because the results were always complete victories.</p><p>Now, MO MO even believed that as long as Feng Yujin came out, Wei Feng would be defeated quickly.</p><p>Even if this old man in black was indeed very strong…</p><p>MO MO covered the wound on her waist with her hand. Blood seeped out continuously from the gaps between her fingers.</p><p>She looked at the old man who grasped a sword in front of her and felt the quiet aura around her that was like the calm before a storm. For the first time, she felt pressure.</p><p>“Let’s merge our bodies.” MO MO said softly.</p><p>“According to Palace Master Bai Zhou, the one that you can exert your full strength to the maximum is the complete ghost beast.”</p><p>“What? Didn’t you say that it would be easy for me to snatch…”</p><p>“Don’t talk!”</p><p>MO MO shook her head lightly and interrupted Feng Yujin’s reply.</p><p>She looked up and glanced at the void. She slowly curled up in the air and lowered her head to hug her knees.</p><p>She voluntarily gave up control of her body, and her soul retreated to the utmost edge of her spiritual world, the place where she was most afraid she would be squeezed by Feng Yujin.</p><p>The flower bud was encased and embraced the darkness.</p><p>In the void, there was only a quiet voice that said, “Feng Yujin, defeat him….”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
