Was Little Ai Cangsheng intending to shatter the entire Four Symbols Secret Realm?</p><p>Before any further persuasion could be attempted, Ai Cangsheng in his wheelchair raised his hands, forming a forceful full moon with his stance.</p><p>In an instant, the atmosphere atop Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe changed drastically.</p><p>Even the Jade Capital City at the foot of the mountain echoed with eerie howls of the wind.</p><p>Numerous powers of evil and sin were extracted from the rocks, grass, and trees, from the bodies of all living things, lingering in the air before converging on the sacred mountain.</p><p>Upon the Evil Sin Bow, the power of the evil god gathered, coalescing into a massive arrow tainted with hues of gray, black, and crimson.</p><p>Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body watched with bated breath.</p><p>It had been decades since she had seen Little Ai Cangsheng this enraged. What had happened to him today?</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Suddenly, a colossal phantom of the Evil Sin Bow manifested above the Sacred Mountain.</p><p>As the Arrow of Evil God took shape, a thunderous roar echoed through the heavens, the sun and moon revolved, and darkness enveloped the sky.</p><p>In the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>The smile on Water Ghost’s face froze abruptly.</p><p>He had come full of confidence, even consulting with Bazhun’an before making his grand appearance. How could someone be so impatient so quickly?</p><p>Water Ghost suddenly raised his gaze.</p><p>Across two realms, through the Water of the Great Path, he felt as if he had been targeted!</p><p>“Is he out of his mind?”</p><p>“Has Ai Cangsheng gone mad?”</p><p>If there was any power that posed a significant threat to the demi-saint of Upanishad, apart from the Penetrating Divine Senses, it was the power of the ancestral source.</p><p>Being elected as one of the Ten High Nobles, Ai Cangsheng became one of the Three Emperors at such a young age…</p><p>He was never one to be trifled with!</p><p>Water Ghost dared not underestimate him. He knew Ai Cangsheng wielded the power of the evil god.</p><p>In essence, Water Ghost himself was cunning and sly. How else could he have orchestrated the situation on Abyss Island?</p><p>So, at this moment, there was no way he would openly confront Ai Cangsheng’s lethal arrow!</p><p>“Guardian Saint Wei An, I shall take my leave first.”</p><p>Water Ghost hastily gestured towards the void. He had some acquaintance with Wei An from the days when he was still Yu Mo:</p><p>“If Ai Cangsheng shatters the Four Symbols Secret Realm with this arrow, slaughtering three thousand trial-takers, you should hold the Holy Divine Palace responsible. They are truly ruthless!”</p><p>“But if not, after today, I, the Water Ghost, will acknowledge you as the strongest defender of the Saint lineage.”</p><p>With a puff, the Water Ghost transformed into an illusion of foam and vanished.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu was flustered in the wind.</p><p>He looked up.</p><p>The sky’s watery curtain was gone. With Water Ghost’s departure, wouldn’t he be exposed to Ai Cangsheng’s gaze?</p><p>He couldn’t even stop a basic arrow from the Evil Sin Bow!</p><p>Cen Qiaofu felt a chill down his spine, facing the saint calamity of the Nine</p><p>Heavens, he yelled in panic, “Get back here!”</p><p>In the void, Wei An, hidden within the Path Principles, heard the shout. His</p><p>face grew even darker, almost spitting out blood:</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, we are sworn enemies!”</p><p>“Are you asleep? How could you let Ai Cangsheng shoot like this?!”</p><p>Even though Wei An knew Water Ghost might be using him, at this moment, he couldn’t stay silent.</p><p>He glanced toward the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, disregarding the Four Symbols Secret Realm entirely, before dashing out:</p><p>“Sovereign Cangsheng, stop this at once!!!”</p><p>This holy voice crossed Gong Yang Mountain, passed through the Qilin realm, reached Jade Capital City, and entered the ears of the divine envoy, Nine Sacrificial Osmanthus.</p><p>Yet Ai Cangsheng turned a deaf ear.</p><p>“Puff.’</p><p>Water Ghost returned with a friendly smile on his face:</p><p>“Guardian Saint Wei An, let me lend you a hand and protect the Four Symbols</p><p>Secret Realm together!”</p><p>Wei An glared at him with blazing anger.</p><p>He had been targeted by Ai Cangsheng’s Eyes of the Great Path. There was no escape and nowhere to hide. He only came back to use the Four Symbols Secret Realm as a shield, didn’t he?!</p><p>“I’ll use the Four Symbols as a shield, and the Four Symbols will use you as a shield. Let’s work together to defend against the degenerate Holy Divine</p><p>Palace. ”</p><p>“Shut up!!”</p><p>“Then should I leave?”</p><p>“Come back!</p><p>Water Ghost, this petty man, tried to use the trial-takers as shields, attempting to force Ai Cangsheng to lower his bow. Wei An dared not take the risk.</p><p>No matter what, he had to prepare for the worst.</p><p>Once Ai Cangsheng released the arrow, having an Upanishad demi-saint by his side, even if Wei An was forcibly taken onto a dark path, it was far better than facing the Arrow of Evil Sin Bow alone.</p><p>At this moment, Wei An still held a glimmer of hope.</p><p>He knew that Sovereign Cangsheng was not just saying empty words. He genuinely cared for the people and was truly a compassionate man.</p><p>He would never release this arrow!</p><p>However, this time, Wei An miscalculated…</p><p>“Bang!!!”</p><p>On the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, the sound shattered the gloomy clouds.</p><p>The Arrow of Evil God shook the Holy Divine Land!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
