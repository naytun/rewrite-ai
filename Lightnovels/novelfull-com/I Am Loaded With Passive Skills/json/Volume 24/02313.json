Before he could calm down, he shouted again.</p><p>“This is the headquarters of the Three Incenses!”</p><p>“I don’t care who you are, but when you’re here, you’d better comply with the rules. ”</p><p>“If you dare to kill people here and break the rules, the Three Incenses have plenty of ways to torture you, Xu Gusheng, to death!”</p><p>At this point, the killers who had amassed earlier relaxed slightly.</p><p>The Three Incenses indeed had their own rules.</p><p>After they left the headquarters, everyone could assassinate each other. After all, some of the killers’ heads were also on the bounty, and they were also very valuable.</p><p>However, in the hall, the gold hunting token killers had to consider whether they were qualified enough to withstand the anger of the Three Incenses.</p><p>“+(Stared at. Passive Points, +)+264.” “+(Feared, Passive Points,+)+34.”</p><p>The Information Bar jumped repeatedly.</p><p>Everyone stared at the sickly young master, but even the higher void couldn’t locate Jin Ren.</p><p>The paper fan suddenly closed.</p><p>Everyone’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>The sickly young master’s icy demeanor faded away and his expression became friendly.</p><p>“It’s just a joke. Why is everyone so nervous?”</p><p>“Did you really think that with so many people here, you can’t defeat my guard?”</p><p>As soon as he said this, the Three Incenses attendants who wanted to issue him a reminder but didn’t dare to, let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>At least, they didn’t have to face Xu Gusheng, who had an unknown trump card.</p><p>There were a few more mocking laughs in the dead silent hall, followed by self-deprecating sighs that finally evolved into low mutterings of mockery and condemnation of the people around them.</p><p>“Just this?”</p><p>“Haha, White Wolf, you’ve been played for a fool.”</p><p>“If it had been me, I would not stand for it.’</p><p>“I would not stand for it either. I have to think of a way to f*ck him again.” D*mn it, I thought he was serious. So it was just a scare tactic?”</p><p>That’s right.</p><p>This was the Three Incenses!</p><p>Who dared to mess around here?</p><p>White Wolf swallowed the lump in his throat. His mouth twitched and he said with lingering fear.</p><p>“Hehe, Xu Gusheng, right? You know your place.”</p><p>“Today, if we had not fought, we would not be acquainted… Who are you? Why did you come through the teleportation portal? I’ve never seen you before. Let’s be friends?”</p><p>White Wolf finally regained his confidence. He laughed loudly and walked over. He even stretched out his hand.</p><p>However, his eyes would occasionally fall on the sickly young master’s slender and fair fingers. His eyes were filled with fear and lust that made people feel uncomfortable.</p><p>“Be friends?” The sickly young master smiled, but he did not extend his hand.</p><p>“Uh-huh.” White Wolf subconsciously licked his lips and looked down. “As the saying goes, the more friends you have, it would lead to more… roads, hehe.”</p><p>“Are you worthy?”</p><p>“Uhh!”</p><p>This sudden question not only stunned everyone present, but it made White Wolf raise his head in shock and confusion.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, the void exploded.</p><p>There was a bloody hole in the center of White Wolf’s forehead, as if he had been shot with a gun.</p><p>Before he could say anything, White Wolf felt the world in front of him dissipate.</p><p>His eyes still reflected the shock he felt and his body had already fallen to the ground even as he lifted his head.</p><p>Bang! ”</p><p>The Sovereign Stage had died!</p><p>The corpse smashed onto the floor. It was a ghastly sight.</p><p>An uproar broke out in the Three Incenses’ hall. Everyone knew that White Wolf would not have come forward unprepared. He must have been on his guard.</p><p>However, White Wolf was still unable to react…</p><p>Not to mention him, everyone behind him, even until the moment White Wolf fell, could not guess who had attacked.</p><p>“You, you killed him?”</p><p>This shocked cry came from his ‘good friend’ who had provoked White Wolf several times but had also warned White Wolf to retreat.</p><p>“Oh? I should have killed you instead?”</p><p>The sickly young master tapped his paper fan in amusement and turned to look. “Is there a problem?”</p><p>“You, you…”</p><p>“Are you trying to say, “Even with the Three Incenses’ rule, I still dare to kill someone?”‘</p><p>“You…”</p><p>“You still want to say it; Didn’t I say that it was just a joke?”</p><p>As soon as these two phrases were heard, everyone in the hall gasped.</p><p>Everyone could tell that Xu Gusheng was not crazy. He was extremely calm!</p><p>However, this calmness was even more fatal.</p><p>He really ignored the rules of the Three Incenses!</p><p>Did he think that everyone, everything, and the rules were all a joke?</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>At this point, the attendant who had been trembling in fear, had no choice but to step forward and shouted.</p><p>The sickly young master tilted his head back and shook his paper fan vigorously a few times. He sneered and remarked in an extremely sarcastic tone.</p><p>“Stop what?”</p><p>“When I said I’ll let you all off, it was a joke so that you can have some fun before you die. You’re a fun person in life, and you will be a happy ghost in death. ”</p><p>“You are all killers. You can’t be that naive as to believe this, right?”</p><p>When everyone saw the sickly young master’s current state, they felt as if they were looking at a crazy young master.</p><p>But that guy was not done yet!</p><p>As he spoke, he turned around and pointed at the two women behind him with a paper fan. He said in disbelief.</p><p>“Do you think you can casually touch the people I brought?”</p><p>He stopped talking and trod on White Wolf’s corpse. He appeared shocked as he pointed at himself with a paper fan..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
