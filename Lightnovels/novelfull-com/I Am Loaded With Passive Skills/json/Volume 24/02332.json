His tone was the same as before, without a trace of respect.</p><p>“No!” The sickly young master fell asleep under the care of Yingying and</p><p>Qiao’er, but there was no trace of fatigue on his face. He only said leisurely,</p><p>“Go to Golden Phoenix Street, Golden Phoenix Square.”</p><p>Yougui Pavilion.</p><p>While everyone was stirring up trouble in the underground black market, Xu Xiaoshou stopped calling out to the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and looked at the uninvited guest at the door. The very rude Aunt Xiang.</p><p>“You pushed open the door without the owner’s permission. Is this how you treat your guests?”</p><p>“This is my room!” Aunt Xiang rolled her eyes and did not give him a good look at all.</p><p>After entering, she locked the door and activated the spiritual array.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could vaguely see that before the door closed, there were two women with exquisite looks and figures standing outside the door. They were curiously looking inside.</p><p>This sizing up was very irregular!</p><p>It was obvious that these two were not from Yougui Pavilion.</p><p>Aunt Xiang had just gone out and brought these two girls over. What was she up to now?</p><p>“What is it?” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t ask about them but instead, went straight for the important matters.</p><p>Aunt Xiang did not say what was going on. Instead, she placed her hands on the table and bent down. She took the lead and asked oppressively,” Was it you who caused the matter at Three Incenses?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lifted his eyes from his seat. He could feel the surging waves. He smiled and said, “Aunt Xiang, your ears are very sharp. You have someone with you in Three Incenses?”</p><p>“Hmph, as I thought!” Aunt Xiang snorted proudly at first, but then she was curious and impressed. “How did you do it?”</p><p>“Heaven’s secrets cannot be revealed.” Xu Xiaoshou waved his paper fan.</p><p>“You…” Aunt Xiang choked and glared at him. “You’re becoming more and more like that Elder Dao the Flamboyant!” “Detested, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Speak, what is it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t pay attention to the details. He only paid attention to Aunt Xiang’s intention.</p><p>It was obvious that only serious matters could make her so anxious. This matter couldn’t be about the two women outside the door.</p><p>Aunt Xiang had wanted to say it directly. However, her peach blossom eyes rolled around. She was no longer in a hurry. She crossed her arms and sat down. She snorted, “Guess.”</p><p>“I’m not guessing.”</p><p>“There’s a reward for guessing correctly!”</p><p>“As long as it’s not the two people at the door.”</p><p>“You…” Aunt Xiang choked again and said angrily,” Young Master Xu, your standards are really high. These are already the two most outstanding people in the Xiang family. They are both good-looking and have good figures. You don’t even like them?”</p><p>“Yes.</p><p>“You!”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang stood up and was about to leave. She thought about it and sat back down. “I don’t want to talk to you for the time being. Golden Phoenix Street, Golden Phoenix Square. Go and take a look for yourself. This is what I want to say!”</p><p>“Alright.” Xu Xiaoshou stood up and left.</p><p>Aunt Xiang was shocked.</p><p>He’s leaving just like that?</p><p>Was he really not curious?</p><p>“You brat, you really know how to anger people!” Aunt Xiang stood up angrily and looked at the young man who was about to jump out of the window. “Come back! ”</p><p>“What? Didn’t you tell me to go and see for myself?” Xu Xiaoshou turned around in confusion.</p><p>“You didn’t even meet the women that your Aunt brought?” Aunt Xiang pointed at the door and then at herself. “Aren’t you going to give me any respect?”</p><p>“This isn’t good, right?” Xu Xiaoshou felt a headache coming on. Why did she seem to be urging him to get married? He pointed at himself and said, “I’m just a clone now. Xu Gusheng went to Three Incenses in front of everyone’s eyes. What identity do you want me to use to meet them?”</p><p>“Uhh.” Aunt Xiang coughed three times as if a fishbone was stuck in her throat, feeling extremely uncomfortable.</p><p>“Maybe next time,” Xu Xiaoshou chuckled.</p><p>“What about Ghost Face?” Aunt Xiang seemed to have recalled something. “He’s been waiting for you downstairs for a long time.”</p><p>“I’m not Xu Gusheng. I’m just a small guard. What do I know about negotiation?” Xu Xiaoshou waved his paper fan. “Let him continue to wait.. Or you can ask him to leave behind the secret techniques of the Eight Doors and Seven Constellations. He can leave first. We can’t waste his time.”</p><p>“How can we do that?” Aunt Xiang was anxious. “He brought a big gift…”</p><p>“Oh? Aunt Xiang had seen him? You even knew that he had brought a big gift? Then you guys can talk!”</p><p>Aunt Xiang immediately fell silent. She glared at Xu Xiaoshou with murderous eyes.</p><p>“Glared At, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Oh, right.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have remembered something. He knocked his head with a paper fan and smiled, “My men sent a message saying that there are bad people in the Ghost God gang. Aunt Xiang, you should be careful.’</p><p>The snowflakes on the windowsill swayed, and spatial ripples spread out.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou disappeared, leaving Aunt Xiang alone. She restrained all her emotions and sat down with a sigh.</p><p>“This brat…”</p><p>“He’s too difficult to deal with!”</p><p>“He guessed that I wanted him to take over the Ghost God Gang and help clean up the internal problems?”</p><p>Aunt Xiang looked at the door again.</p><p>“How did he know that I was going to arrange them for him? Is it that obvious?”</p><p>“That’s not right either. These two are completely different from Ah Yao, but their looks and figures are also extremely good. He doesn’t like this type either?”</p><p>Aunt Xiang could not figure it out and continued to think hard.</p><p>Soon, she furrowed her brows. In the end, her brows were so tightly knitted that they were about to stick together.</p><p>Standing up, Aunt Xiang walked to the window. She leaned on the windowsill and looked at the snow outside the window. She took a deep breath. “Could it be that he doesn’t like women? Did I get the gender wrong?”</p><p>“Rum, rumble…”</p><p>The Fragrant Osmanthus Carriage drove steadily..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
