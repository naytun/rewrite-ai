Instead, she calmly said:</p><p>“Oh, my dear Young Master Xu, can’t you make a sound when entering the room?”</p><p>“Breaking into a lady’s chamber like this is really, very, impolite!”</p><p>Aunt Xiang looked at the unfamiliar face before her, clutching the bedding to her chest, and her bewitching eyes were filled with blame.</p><p>To be able to stealthily break the spiritual array…</p><p>To remain undetected…</p><p>And to have the courage to enter this room alone…</p><p>Upon deeper thought, besides the lawless Xu Xiaoshou, who else would dare to do such a thing?</p><p>—Even Dao Qiongcang, when coming to Yougui Pavilion, would first knock and ask, “Are you there?”</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have evolved in the day he was not seen. What preparations had he made?</p><p>“I just wanted to see how vigilant our Aunt Xiang would be when a fierce battle is imminent.”</p><p>“I didn’t expect that after waiting for almost half an hour, you would be sleeping like a log… You can really sleep. From now on, drop the title Aunt Xiang and go by the name Sleeping Aunt!”</p><p>The second true body chuckled, transforming on the spot into the appearance of the sickly young master Xu Gusheng, even pulling out another paper fan with flair.</p><p>But this paper fan wasn’t inscribed by Bazhun’an but copied by Xu Xiaoshou himself.</p><p>A Space Dao Disc unfurled beneath his feet, and the “Moment of</p><p>Enlightenment” was invoked, unleashing his spiritual senses which covered almost the entire Jade Capital City.</p><p>At this moment, all the sights and sounds of the bustling capital flooded his mind.</p><p>The spiritual arrays of numerous sects and factions were simultaneously triggered, ready to send out intruder alerts.</p><p>But before the alerts could be sent, they were effortlessly intercepted and blocked by the second true body.</p><p>The Distraction Manipulation and array-breaking techniques were all brought to their peak by the Weaving Expertise of Holy Emperor Lv.0.</p><p>Even the spiritual arrays guarding the factions in Jade Capital City, some of which were at the Saint Stage, were altered with a thought from Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>An intangible breeze swept through the city, and everything remained peaceful, with no signs of any abnormalities.</p><p>The second true body found the spatial node belonging to Three Incenses and the specific location of the underground black market corresponding to this node.</p><p>He saw the assassins whispering in the hall, the Black Gold Bounty rehung on the mission board, and upstairs, the main body waiting after breaking the spiritual array.</p><p>His form shifted.</p><p>Spatial displacement.</p><p>In an instant, Xu Xiaoshou in the Three Incenses and the second true body in Yougui Pavilion completed their swap.</p><p>Aunt Xiang tightened her thighs on the bed and rubbed her eyes, feeling as if the person in front of her had flickered for a moment, and at the same time, she felt a strange sensation as if she had been stripped naked and thoroughly seen by someone.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what do you want to do!” Aunt Xiang’s eyes narrowed, clutching the bedding tightly.</p><p>“Shh, walls have ears, don’t yell.” Xu Xiaoshou put down the canopy and returned to the side of the table:</p><p>“I went to Three Incenses, killed some people, met Director Zhou, set up a trap…”</p><p>He recounted everything he had done, and finally added:</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou will soon appear on the He Ting Mountain, though initially fake, Li Fugui can handle this matter. Let’s see how the Holy Divine Palace responds.”</p><p>“If they don’t take the bait, my clone will make it happen and cause chaos at He Ting.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang quickly realized that her worries were unfounded.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was still Xu Xiaoshou. He was still quite innocent and was genuinely here to discuss serious matters.</p><p>She chuckled, placing the bedding down before lifting the canopy. Grabbing a shawl, she elegantly stretched her long legs before stepping out.</p><p>“So, you mean, create a diversion and seize the opportunity to enter the Four</p><p>Symbols Secret Realm… You’re ready for this?”</p><p>“Of course, I’m ready personally, but I lack one person.”</p><p>“Who’s missing?” Aunt Xiang sat down at the table, crossing her legs, her skirt slipping down, revealing the snowy and tender skin on her thighs.</p><p>She cupped her chin with both hands, leaned forward with her elbows on the table, and then tilted her head to smile at the extraordinarily handsome and sickly young master with her glistening, bewitching eyes.</p><p>Even just waking up, without any makeup, Aunt Xiang’s charm remained undiminished, exuding a touch of natural beauty. Her skin was delicate, emitting an alluring fragrance from head to toe.</p><p>Speechless, Xu Xiaoshou gazed at her.</p><p>Aunt Xiang raised an eyebrow with a smile, her eyes sparkling.</p><p>“Tempted, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“I need Ah Yao.”</p><p>“As Aunt sees it, you’re lacking Ah…</p><p>Before Aunt Xiang could finish her sentence, she realized that Xu Xiaoshou had beaten her to it. She immediately glared at him with displeasure. “How boring!”</p><p>She straightened up, adjusted her attire, and then returned to point.</p><p>“Speak, who do you lack? Aunt will help you find them.”</p><p>“Frost Ferret.’</p><p>Seeing her grow more serious, Xu Xiaoshou continued, “Elder Han is an indispensable part of the operation. It knows about the Ran Ming ruins and was the first to discover ‘Qilin.’ We must bring it along this time.” Aunt Xiang nodded, “It’s already in the city and should be arriving soon.”</p><p>No sooner had she spoken than the space around them began to twist.</p><p>The room’s door distorted in a peculiar way, and a small white ferret the size of a palm poked its head in..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
