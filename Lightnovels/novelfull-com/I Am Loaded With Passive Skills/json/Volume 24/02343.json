Her figure was still slim, but her chest had clearly been bound, and her silhouette was much more slender.</p><p>Like a butterfly, she grabbed the hem of her green dress and twirled around. She asked him eagerly, “How is it? You can’t recognize me, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his vision turn black.</p><p>“What about this?” Aunt Xiang pinched herself and her voice changed and she looked like an 18 -year-old girl.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou no longer believed that ‘seeing was believing’.</p><p>This was comparable to the ‘Transformation’ of a Holy Emperor!</p><p>Were all professional intelligence agents so strong? One person with two faces, just like Old Man Li?</p><p>“My name is Xiangxiang now. I’m an Innate Stage trial-taker. I’ll enter the Four Symbols Secret Realm in an hour’s time.”</p><p>“I’ve suppressed my strength. I’ll soon break through to the Sovereign Dao Realm regardless of the consequences just to get a good ranking in the Holy Palace Trial.”</p><p>“I can’t show up during the entire operation. I can only help you do an analysis on a spiritual level. Maybe you don’t need it, but it’s better than nothing.”</p><p>“Unless you are in a dire situation where death is imminent, you cannot summon me.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang recounted everything in detail. As she spoke, she took out a star diamond ear stud from the wooden box on the table.</p><p>She turned around and handed the earring over to him. “Contact me through this thing. Crush it if you think you’re in danger of dying and I’ll summon The</p><p>Divine to save you.”</p><p>After a pause, the girl’s eyes became extremely solemn, and her tone became a little more respectful.</p><p>“I only have one warning.”</p><p>“No matter what, do not underestimate Elder Dao the Flamboyant!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took the star diamond earring. It was small and inconspicuous, but it was as heavy as a rock.</p><p>Why did everyone exert so much pressure on him?</p><p>Was Dao Qiongcang really that strong?</p><p>“I’ll remember it.”</p><p>He transformed back into Xu Xiaoshou and put the earring on his earlobe. The earring was small and not obvious.</p><p>He did not need Aunt Xiang to explain, he instantly understood the use of the ear stud.</p><p>It did not even need any spiritual source. It could absorb a little of the Heaven and Earth spiritual energy on its own to maintain its communication function.</p><p>“What an exquisite Divine Secrets Shield technique. It’s obvious that it’s a protection against Elder Dao. Is there anyone in your Xiang family who can make this?” Xu Xiaoshou touched his earlobe and asked with a smile. “It’s Patriarch Wuji’s masterpiece.” the teenage Aunt Xiang shrugged.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s smile disappeared.</p><p>Was it really that serious?</p><p>Even an earring had to be produced by Xuan Wuji. I can make one too!</p><p>“I have to go. Otherwise, I won’t be able to catch up to the mainstream. I’m a real Eight Classics trial-taker. I have a card.” Aunt Xiang flashed her trial-taker token with a cute expression.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t believe that simple makeup could achieve this effect. Perhaps this was the simplest way to the Great Path. He waved his hand and said, “Go!”</p><p>“What about you?” Aunt Xiang asked before she left.</p><p>“I’m a stowaway. It doesn’t matter.” Xu Xiaoshou put away the paper fan and pulled at his original face and grimaced.</p><p>If they were discovered on this trip, their whereabouts would be exposed.</p><p>If he was not discovered, he would not be discovered no matter whose face he wore.</p><p>Xu Gusheng’s clone didn’t have much time left to live, and Dao Qiongcang had forcibly shortened his lifespan by more than ten days. Now, he could end his mission.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou calculated carefully and realized that he was used to being Zhou Tianshen, Xiao Shi Tan Ji and Chen Shu…</p><p>He had become many other people, but it had been a long time since he had been himself.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou’s face shouldn’t be that ugly, right?” Xu Xiaoshou touched his cheeks and smiled at himself.</p><p>“Maybe.” The young girl Xiangxiang smiled and cupped her fists. “Take care.”</p><p>“Take care.” Xu Xiaoshou replied.</p><p>With a bang amid a blossom of fragrance, Xiangxiang disappeared.</p><p>The smile on Xu Xiaoshou’s face also disappeared, and his eyes became extremely solemn.</p><p>He didn’t have time to make any more preparations. He had to take the plunge.</p><p>Fortunately, the biggest preparations had already ended, and the people who should enter the Four Symbols Secret Realm had already arrived.</p><p>The rest would be left to the future!</p><p>“Xiao Han.”</p><p>He muttered in a low voice and the Little Frost Ferret appeared out of nowhere and crawled into his clothes.</p><p>“Feng Yujin?”</p><p>He raised his eyes and looked at the beam. The gray fog that had appeared at some point in time descended and turned into a woman in white.</p><p>The snow was reflected outside the window, and the woman smiled calmly, like an orchid in the empty valley.</p><p>She held her small bronze cauldron and nodded.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, long time no see.”</p><p>With a sizzle, the gray mist behind MO MO condensed into a ghastly face that bared its fangs and brandished its claws.</p><p>Feng Yujin’s voice rang out from MO MO Mo’s throat. She laughed in a sinister manner and there was a hint of coldness in her voice.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, when the Tianxuan Gate couldn’t even kill you, I knew that you would be extraordinary.”</p><p>“But I really didn’t expect you to reach such heights so quickly.”</p><p>Xu Xiao ignored Feng Yujin and waved at MO Mo.</p><p>“Junior Sister MO, long time no see, but it hasn’t been that long, just a month or so.”</p><p>MO MO nodded and turned to look at the white snow outside the window.</p><p>“A month? She’s…</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>Before Feng Yujin could finish his sentence, MO MO cut him off.</p><p>What kind of situation were these two people in, could they get along harmoniously? Xu Xiaoshou was bewildered, but he didn’t ask further.</p><p>Feng Yujin had volunteered to come here because of Bazhun’an’s threat. There was no need to expose his shortcomings at this time.</p><p>The Space Dao Disc spun under his feet and Xu Xiaoshou reached out his hand.</p><p>“I’m going to teleport. Don’t resist.”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>MO MO reached out her hand and gently placed it on his palm. Her palm must have touched the snowflakes outside the window just now. It was cold and wet.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held her hand. After a pause, he shouted.</p><p>“Big! Space! Time! Move! Shift!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
