Now, under the saint calamity, after what the one with the least power in the dark faction said, did your heart waver?”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The saint calamity was brilliant.</p><p>Wei An’s face reflected the bright light.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s axe shattered the lightning, and his body sank.</p><p>His heart sank too as he looked at the fox-eyed man in the red cloak.</p><p>This fellow…</p><p>So, this was his true purpose?</p><p>Yue Gongli’s voice was filled with emotion, and he almost knocked off his cloak with his exaggerated movements.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, that slut… Uh, how could Hallmaster Dao influence you?”</p><p>“You only saved people, you only stopped the dark faction, you only wanted to protect something. After your tasks are completed, you can leave at any time.” You are a demi-saint, the Saint Guardian of the Holy Palace Wei An!”</p><p>“If you say ‘no’, how many people in the five regions would dare to refuse as well?”</p><p>“Puff!” Yue Gongli suddenly smiled and said.</p><p>“Sorry, that sounded a bit far-fetched…”</p><p>“That’s not important. What’s important is that Young Master Wei An must have understood what I meant. That’s enough.”</p><p>Wei An was surprised.</p><p>This was the first time he had seen someone whose thoughts reached such heights.</p><p>Yue Gongli pointed at Cen Qiaofu, who was engulfed by the lightning, and said with disdain.</p><p>“A rat crossing the street is hated by everyone. Young Master Wei An is right.</p><p>Aren’t you Saint Servants all like that?”</p><p>“All of you rely on your rotten mouths to deal out damage, and you still want to shake our Young Master Wei An’s Dao heart?”</p><p>Yue Gongli waved his long arm in the air and said in disdain.</p><p>“Saint calamity! Strike him!”</p><p>Rumble…</p><p>Rumble…</p><p>The saint calamity had never stopped. It did not listen to anyone’s orders, nor did it stop for anyone.</p><p>Yue Gongli, on the other hand, had a great time. It was as if he could summon lightning with a wave of his hand. It was as if he was Kui Leihan and Cao Yihan was just an imposter.</p><p>Everyone who was within and out of the range of the saint calamity witnessed this…The silence was deafening.</p><p>The corners of Wei An’s mouth twitched slightly. He glanced at the two people he protected and suddenly it did not really matter.</p><p>In the midst of the saint calamity, Cen Qiaofu’s face was so black that it was as if ink could drip from it.</p><p>What kind of knife skill was this that Yue Gongli used to move and slash about? Each of his sentence was not something that a normal person could guard against, but it caught them off guard!</p><p>But there was no doubt that the effect was excellent.</p><p>The moment he came, he destroyed all the facts that he had laid out to Wei An!</p><p>If Cen Qiaofu was certain that after his words, even if the Holy Palace would not hold any grudges against the Holy Divine Palace, at least in the Four Symbols Secret Realm, Dao Qiongcang would not make use of Wei An.</p><p>Now, Cen Qiaofu felt that the situation had turned chaotic again.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu felt that it was very possible that Wei An would take action against him.</p><p>This Yue Gongli seemed to be out of character, but he was actually very cunning!</p><p>“Haha, why are you so silent now?” “Did I hit the nail on the head?”</p><p>“So you have nothing to say or refute?”</p><p>“You clown, how dare you undergo sanctification in the Four Symbols Secret Realm? Not only were you disrespectful, but you also shamelessly claimed that the Holy Palace had ‘enough’. I think you’re tired of living!”</p><p>Outside of the saint calamity, Yue Gongli’s annoying laughter was full of insults.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu felt depressed when he heard this, and a certain hedgehog suddenly flashed across his mind.</p><p>When he faced the hedgehog, he also encountered this absurd and helpless feeling. This was the same kind of person he was!</p><p>“Oh, right.’</p><p>After Yue Gongli had enough fun, he stopped summoning the thunderbolts. He finally remembered what he had to do. He scratched his head and said.</p><p>“Young Master Wei An, actually, I was late because I knew what was going on here. I went to look for that slut… Uh, Hallmaster Dao to get some Divine Array Wheels.”</p><p>“You won’t blame me for being late, right? Young Master Wei An…”</p><p>“I really didn’t mean for you to come forward. I just wanted to get to the root of the problem and solve it.”</p><p>Wei An was silent.</p><p>He quietly watched as the fox-eyed man finished his speech, then took out three array wheels from his sleeve.</p><p>He realized that the act of nodding and answering was a waste when one faced such a chatterbox.</p><p>Yue Gongli began to make some hand gestures that no one could understand. There were no spiritual fluctuations, and it might even have nothing to do with the Divine Secret, only something that he thought was very cool.</p><p>After he fiddled with it for a while, he secretly injected his Holy Power into the three Divine Array Wheels and threw them at the three people in the air and on the ground. He then shouted.</p><p>“Divine Thirty-Six Form, Great Shielding Technique!”</p><p>Weng!</p><p>The Divine Array Wheels turned into a stream of light and shot towards Fangfang, Wang Dachui, and Wei An.</p><p>The saint calamity trembled violently, and its power seemed to weaken. When the lightning struck again, it no longer locked onto the three of them.</p><p>“I-I… am alive?”</p><p>Fangfang had only half of his bloody body. His eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>When he looked up and saw that there was really no more thunder calamity above his head except for a light shield that protected him, the bearded youth’s eyes were filled with tears.</p><p>He had thought that the Ruler of the red-clothed people had come to make fun of him.</p><p>He thought that this senior liked to put on a show, but he had long forgotten about the lives and deaths of his subordinates.</p><p>He didn’t expect that Senior Yue Gongli would save him and Senior Dachui!</p><p>In the time it took to throw the array wheel, he had removed the lock on of the saint calamity.. This was truly a miracle!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
