Fangfang, who had been split into two, and Wang Dachui, who had been cut in half, became its targets.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s butt was badly mangled and one of his legs had been ripped off.</p><p>He was in a very dire condition and he had no time to care about anything else. He could only focus on his own saint calamity.</p><p>He consumed the Rejuvenation Pill and held the Pan Xian Ax and shattered all the surging thunderbolts.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Two strange sounds exploded nearby.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the sounds were that of Fangfang and Wang Dachui being struck by the saint calamity.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu closed his eyes.</p><p>He didn’t feel anything when Wang Dachui died.</p><p>However, when he thought about Fangfang now, it made one sigh with regret. What a good seedling!</p><p>The lightning shattered on the ground. After Cen Qiaofu released his spiritual senses, he trembled.</p><p>What he saw was not the two Chiefs of the six divisions who had died under the thunder calamity, but a Saint’s pure light shield that protected them below.</p><p>Weng!</p><p>Holy Energy from the void descended.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu suddenly looked up and saw Wei An, who stood at a short distance away.</p><p>“Saint Guardian Wei An?”</p><p>“The demi-saint Saint Guardian from the Holy Palace came out to protect the two Chiefs of the six divisions of the Holy Divine Palace?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s eyebrows shot up in surprise.</p><p>The saint calamity in the sky expanded again. It clearly sensed demi-saint Wei An’s aura.</p><p>This time, the danger level rose steadily, as if there had been a qualitative transformation.</p><p>“Enough.’</p><p>Wei An, who hovered in the air, had a solemn expression. He did not mention anything about what had taken place before and only expressed his stance on what would happen next.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu looked up at the saint calamity and then at Wei An, who was also bathed in the Holy Light. He laughed. “What do you mean by ‘enough’?”</p><p>“Enough. This is the end of the matter. Let bygones be bygones, but you should stop. Don’t bring about any more meaningless sacrifices.” Wei An said.</p><p>“Hahahaha…” Cen Qiaofu laughed when he heard this. He held his axe as if he was in a stand off in the air. His higher void level was not inferior to that of a Saint.</p><p>He grinned and shook his head. “Kid, do you really know what ‘enough’ means? Do you really know what ‘meaningless sacrifice’ means?”</p><p>Wei An’s expression was calm and he didn’t say a word.</p><p>In terms of age, Cen Qiaofu was indeed older than his grandfather.</p><p>“I came here to undergo sanctification, but I didn’t hurt the innocent. I didn’t use the saint calamity to threaten any of the participants at the Holy Palace Trial.” Cen Qiaofu said.</p><p>“This is because this Saint had cleared all the trial-takers from the scene in advance.” Wei An looked at him.</p><p>“No, this is because I know that you will clear the trial-takers from the scene and hand the battlefield over to your partner, the Holy Divine Palace!” Cen Qiaofu sneered. “This is a choice that the Holy Palace made in advance. Now that you are forced to do this, don’t accommodate others!”</p><p>Wei An’s eyes narrowed and he stopped talking.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s words seemed unreasonable, but in fact, he had hit the nail on the head.</p><p>With a rumble, the saint calamity descended again.</p><p>However, the lightning could not break through the halo around the Saint Guardian Wei An, nor could it break through the light shields that protected Fangfang and Wang Dachui.</p><p>After Cen Qiaofu resisted the first attack, his spiritual senses spread out and covered the entire area.</p><p>He saw a large group of red and white-clothed people outside the range of the saint calamity. He also saw many trial-takers in the distance.</p><p>He gathered his spiritual source and spat out with all his might as he sent his voice to the entire Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>“The Holy Palace already knew that the Holy Divine Palace wanted to use the Ran Ming ruins to deal with some people, such as me.”</p><p>“The battle will definitely involve the battle for the Struggle for the Great Path and the Holy Path. Of course, it will affect the progress of the Holy Palace Trial.”</p><p>“But why did you choose to work together, with no regard for the lives and deaths of the trial-takers?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu spread his hands and said coldly,</p><p>“I don’t know what kind of agreement the Holy Divine Palace had reached with your Holy Palace.”</p><p>“But since you knew that the war is imminent, you still dared to set the trial in the Four Symbols Secret Realm. You must have made thorough preparations.” “Now, Wei An, what nonsense are you spouting in front of me?”</p><p>There was a hint of irritation in Wei An’s eyes, but Cen Qiaofu wasn’t afraid. He raised his voice again.</p><p>“Enough?”</p><p>“This is just the beginning. Tell me, is this enough?”</p><p>He looked around and said in amusement.</p><p>“I know my limits. I only broke the Divine Array and didn’t hurt the people and things in your Holy Palace Trial. I didn’t even split open your so-called trial Golden Tower with my axe.”</p><p>“In that case, isn’t it your duty to protect the trial-takers? Is that something you should do?”</p><p>“But now, take a look at yourself. What are you doing?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu became aggressive.</p><p>“You want to draw a line with me, but I know what I’m doing. You’ve crossed the line and interfered with matters outside of the Holy Palace Trial.”</p><p>“So, who is this enough for?”</p><p>“Who should stop now?”</p><p>A rumble of thunder sounded as it struck down.</p><p>Wei An was rendered speechless, but he didn’t move at all under the saint calamity.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu couldn’t withstand the qualitative change of the saint calamity. He swallowed another Elixir and stared at Wei An.</p><p>His voice spread throughout the entire Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>Everyone, including the trial-takers and trial officials, as well as the red and white-clothed people, heard what he said and were in deep thought.</p><p>Wei An was silent for a long time. He glanced at Fangfang and Wang Dachui, who were split in half. He said in a deep voice, “The rats that crossed the street are hated by everyone. What I said was not inappropriate.”</p><p>“Everyone wants to beat the rats that crossed the street’!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu slapped his thigh and laughed. He then straightened up and looked at Wei An, who held up the banner of justice and was bathed in the pure white holy light..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
