You’re so dazzling! ”</p><p>Wei An was furious and was about to speak, but after Cen Qiaofu lowered his voice, he then raised it again.</p><p>“But what you care about is justice?”</p><p>“But what you see is the truth?”</p><p>“The Holy Palace nurtured you Saints, but did it give you all the ability to distinguish right from wrong?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu pointed at Fangfang and Wang Dachui.</p><p>“Were there no demi-saints in the Holy Divine Palace? They needed you to come and save them?”</p><p>“They’ve asked for help for so long. Why was it that you Wei An, the only Saint who could block the saint calamity was sent to save them from the abyss of suffering?</p><p>“Use your brain, little puppet!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu mocked.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang played with you, and you did not even know it!”</p><p>“Today, you stood up for the hypocritical justice in your heart and saved their lives.”</p><p>“Tomorrow, the unpredictable Hallmaster Dao will use hundreds of beautiful excuses that even you think are reasonable to drag you into the trap.”</p><p>“Can you say something now to persuade me that it is ‘enough’? Do you dare to say that your actions are ‘enough’ on behalf of the entire Holy Palace. You would not then become Dao Qiongcang’s tool and destroy the fate that your</p><p>Holy Palace had accumulated for hundreds of years?”</p><p>The saint calamity rumbled and fell from the sky and instilled enlightenment.</p><p>In the Four Symbols Secret Realm, the dark sky lit up for a moment.</p><p>The trial officers who belonged to the Holy Palace, the red and white-clothed people who belonged to the Holy Divine Palace – their hearts trembled as their minds were filled with turbulent thoughts.</p><p>They kept telling themselves that the Saint Servant Cen Qiaofu’s words were just a ploy to sow discord.</p><p>However, they began to secretly ask themselves why no demi-saint from the Holy Divine Palace appeared to help?</p><p>In the end, the battle just now was indeed ended by Wei An of the Holy Palace. Wang Dachui had waited for half a day before the demi-saint from the Heavenly Group came to support him…</p><p>The unpredictable Dao Qiongcang, what was he thinking about?</p><p>Wei An remained silent.</p><p>He had a vague sense that he was being used.</p><p>Just like what he had said to Dao Qiongcang on the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe: the Holy Palace and the Holy Palace Trial, the Holy Divine Palace against the Holy Divine Palace, they would not interfere in each other’s affairs.</p><p>However, when he saw that higher void Fangfang, who was only sixteen years old, was really going to die under the saint calamity, Wei An was moved.</p><p>He still made a move and used his own strength to protect this peerless genius.</p><p>This didn’t even consume much energy. It was just a piece of cake to him Wei An vaguely felt that something was wrong, but he didn’t think it was anything.</p><p>It wasn’t until Cen Qiaofu’s words made it clear that he realized in horror that he had taken the bait!</p><p>He had suggested this ‘wishful thinking’ to Dao Qiongcang, and he had agreed.</p><p>However, he had crossed the line and interfered in the war between the Holy Divine Palace and the Saint Servant without even being aware of it.</p><p>This was Dao Qiongcang?</p><p>Cen Qiaofu looked at Xiao Wei’s bewildered expression. His voice softened, but it still carried a hint of mockery,</p><p>“The Holy Palace is only a base for the cultivation of Saints. It doesn’t get involved in the disputes of the secular world. This rule has been passed down for many years, and there is a reason for this.”</p><p>“So, little puppet, don’t be so self-righteous.”</p><p>“You don’t even understand human life. Don’t think that just because you’ve reached the cultivation level of a Saint, you can be a living Bodhisattva in the secular world.”</p><p>“Right now, you are the one who had crossed the line. You are the one who has had ‘enough’. It is time for you to stop, not me!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu waved his hand and looked at the two people below.</p><p>“If you want these two, I will give them to you. Bring them back to your Holy Palace and nurture them well!”</p><p>“If you want to interfere in the current situation, I won’t be able to defeat you for the time being. However, I can’t guarantee that the Holy Palace will be able to retreat unscathed after they really enter the situation.”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu chuckled and did not look at the demi-saint Wei An who was deep in thought.</p><p>He saw it too clearly, but he chose not to say the last sentence directly.</p><p>The Saint Servant didn’t want the Holy Palace to become his enemy, so he would let the Holy Palace go at any time and allow them escape.</p><p>However, once Dao Qiongcang was involved with Wei An, he would not let it go easily!</p><p>Wei An remained silent.</p><p>His silence had changed from disdain to being silent, to not wanting to explain and eventually to having nothing to say.</p><p>He glanced at Fangfang and Wang Dachui and his fingers moved slightly.</p><p>He originally wanted to take the two of them away directly, but now, deep down in his heart, he actually did not want to save them at all.</p><p>“Pa! Pa! Pa!”</p><p>At this moment, several crisp claps sounded from the horizon.</p><p>Under the moonlight and the saint calamity, a handsome man dressed in a red robe that revealed his chest, walked over leisurely from the sky.</p><p>Yue Gongli’s fox-like eyes squinted and he smiled at them. His eyes were long and narrow, and his smile could make thousands of girls swoon.</p><p>As he clapped, he walked curiously into the battle scene and asked.</p><p>“Creating confusion, such a glib tongue… Is this the tradition of the Saint Servant?</p><p>“Your people are all good at sophistry.. Even our Young Master Wei An was reduced to silence?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
