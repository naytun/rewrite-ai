He shouted out in the human language.</p><p>In an instant, waves of Blade Will surged out from behind him. Each wave was higher than the last, and the saber intent stacked one on top of the other.</p><p>His Yama’s Banquet was pushed forward layer by layer. With a tearing sound, it cut through the heaven sealing Ghost Hand and quickly advanced towards MO Mo’s neck.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Killing intent surged from one side, but the other side remained calm.</p><p>MO MO could even lower her head and stare at the hole on her chest. “Don’t ruin my dress.” She whispered.</p><p>“You still care about your dress?” Feng Yujin’s angry voice immediately rolled out from her throat.</p><p>“Too slow!”</p><p>“I’ve waited for you for a century before you summoned me!”</p><p>“If you had been a little slower just now, we would have met in hell. Do you really think that this old man is easy to deal with?”</p><p>“Then you should have made your move earlier.” MO Mo’s eyes turned vicious as she spoke. She leaned back and produced an illusion of a grey mist figure. Her hands quickly formed a seal.</p><p>“You said it yourself! If you did not summon me, I can’t come out! Have you forgotten?” Feng Yujin’s voice sounded like he was about to collapse.</p><p>However, as the grey mist figure quickly formed seals, Wei Feng’s saber broke through the heaven sealing Ghost Hand. Six ancient doors with cracks on them were carved onto his body.</p><p>“You should be flexible.” MO Mo’s eyes were calm as she said these two words.</p><p>“What do you mean by ‘be flexible’? I was also flexible the last time, so didn’t you stop talking? This time, you’re telling me to be flexible again!”</p><p>“The previous situation was not urgent.”</p><p>“Then what is ‘urgent’ and what is the definition of ‘urgent’?”</p><p>“You’re very anxious now.” “Ahhhh! Woman! Shut up!” “Ahhhh! Say something!”</p><p>MO MO stopped talking.</p><p>Feng Yujin realized that something had gone wrong.</p><p>This little girl wouldn’t be angry again and stop chatting with me, right?</p><p>However, it was too late to apologize. Wei Feng’s blade was merciless.</p><p>The moment the saber light sealed his throat, the grey mist figure formed a seal with its hands, and the world instantly shook.</p><p>“Six Paths, Dusty Gate!”</p><p>The Yama’s Banquet was outside, but it was Wei Feng inside.</p><p>The sealed door that was initially just a crack in the door instantly took shape and turned into a six-sided body. It sealed Wei Feng into the world inside the door.</p><p>The Blade Will of the Yama’s Banquet paused as if it had been thrown into a different extradimensional space. It could not sense its owner’s power for some time and stopped in front of MO Mo’s throat.</p><p>Jin Ren was dumbfounded.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Feng Yujin was being controlled by MO MO?</p><p>He held his head in his hands in the disappearing world. He was even more shocked than when he saw Wei Feng use his Penetrating Divine Senses.</p><p>However, this was no longer important.</p><p>On the battlefield, the grey mist figure that was Feng Yujin’s spiritual technique directly pulled Jin Ren back to the battle that had taken place in the Tianxuan Gate.</p><p>The spiritual technique was the same, but the strength and speed of the formation were completely different.</p><p>At that time, the spiritual technique of the Six Paths Dusty Gate required a lot of waiting time before it could take shape and trap the enemy.</p><p>Now, with just a few words, Feng Yujin had trapped the demi-saint Wei Feng.</p><p>This was simply a qualitative leap!</p><p>However, before he could mull over it, blood-red energy and light seeped out from the gaps of the six doors that had sealed Wei Feng.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Wei Feng let out a roar that pierced through the world inside the door.</p><p>At the end of his roar, he used the killing thoughts of the blood-red gas column to break through the six gates and crush everything into a primitive gray fog.</p><p>The Penetrating Divine Senses was said to be a cross-generation creation that could rival the power of the ancestral source.</p><p>Moreover, the old sword Saint’s killing thoughts had been cultivated for decades. It was far stronger than Xu Xiaoshou’s sword cognition that had only been cultivated for a short period of time.</p><p>Once the seal was removed, Wei Feng was like a beast that had escaped from its cage.</p><p>He held the Yama’s Banquet and swung his saber horizontally. Blood light filled the air as it swept over.</p><p>“Demon Slayer!”</p><p>MO Mo’s body had already retreated when the Six Paths Dusty Gate broke.</p><p>But Wei Feng’s blade was too fast!</p><p>Manipulating MO Mo’s weak body through a layer was the biggest obstacle Feng Yujin faced in this battle!</p><p>Even so, his battle consciousness was still so high that he managed to turn MO Mo’s body into gray fog in time. This allowed the blood light of the ‘Demon Slayer’ to slice through him and pierce MO MO instead.</p><p>“Boom boom…”</p><p>The giant mural started to collapse.</p><p>The bloody light of the blade blasted the side of the tunnel and opened up another gap beside the only entrance of the Ran Ming ruins that led to the unknown.</p><p>Above the Ran Ming ruins, near the high cliff of the Black Water Stream, the mountains collapsed and the ground caved in!</p><p>The white and red-clothed people who were on it didn’t know what had happened, but they were startled like birds in the forest.</p><p>When they flew into the sky, everyone looked down and saw that the mountains had collapsed into a low-lying area, and formed a long flat line.</p><p>In just a short breath, the mountains that sank oozed with killing intent and blood and left a red trail of about a thousand miles.</p><p>All the living beings on them, except for the trial-takers who were taken away by Wei An, who had been paying attention to the battle here, perished.</p><p>A very familiar killing intent… Cheng Huan and the others were stunned as they hovered in mid-air. They looked at each other as they stared at the collapsed ground.</p><p>“Senior Wei Feng?”</p><p>“This, this was the mark of a saber?”</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>Jin Ren gasped.</p><p>We Feng’s saber was too overbearing!</p><p>Only Master Siren’s sword image could withstand this saber that had the Penetrating Divine Senses, right?</p><p>If it was an ordinary demi-saint, wouldn’t he be able to kill Jiang Buyi with one saber move?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
