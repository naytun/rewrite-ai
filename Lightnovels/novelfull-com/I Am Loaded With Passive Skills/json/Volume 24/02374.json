His face was green and coupled with his fangs, he looked as ferocious as a crazy beast.</p><p>“Kill them!”</p><p>“Kill them all!”</p><p>“As long as they all die, I will still be me… Secret, it’s still a secret…”</p><p>Wei Feng pulled out the Yama’s Banquet from the ground.</p><p>The dark green broadsword emitted a faint light. The dragon scale patterns on the blade were activated and lit up with a blood red glow.</p><p>“Kill them all!”</p><p>Wei Feng raised his head and roared. The surging and illusory killing intent condensed and turned into a wave of blood-red anger.</p><p>This aura pierced through the sky.</p><p>It broke through the giant stone dome at the entrance of the Ran Ming ruins, blasted through the abyss of the Black Water Stream that had a depth of thousands of feet, repelled the black fog, and finally broke through the sky of the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Blood light appeared.</p><p>All the trial-takers, trial officials, and stowaways at the Four Symbols Secret Realm saw this.</p><p>“A phenomenon had just descended from the sky. There must be a treasure!” Just as someone started to have thoughts of greed, he heard a furious voice from the Nine Heavens.</p><p>“Kill! Everyone!!”</p><p>This angry voice was filled with bloody killing power. With a single thought from a Saint, the body and mind and qi combined into one and turned into substance. It spread in all directions, and everyone who heard it went crazy.</p><p>Even the trial officers at the Cutting Path Stage, the higher void trial officers as well as the red and white-clothed people lost control instantly. They were controlled by the killing intent, and they brandished their sabers to slaughter the people around them. It was only when the ear-piercing sounds of weapons rang out that they came to their senses.</p><p>It was even more unbearable for those trial-takers at the Innate and Master</p><p>Stage.</p><p>When the weak heard the sound, blood spurted from their seven orifices and they fell to the ground.</p><p>When the experts lost their intelligence, they could still move but they would have a cultivation deviation.</p><p>A white-robed figure with a Saint halo appeared in the sky of the Four Symbols Secret Realm in the nick of time. With a wave of his hand, he produced a light shield that covered all the trial-takers.</p><p>The influence of this bloody killing intent was barely broken.</p><p>However, the treatment of the wounded and the subsequent treatment of their mental state after being affected by the Holy Power ran into problems.</p><p>Wei An was really angry.</p><p>But now, he did not dare to leave the Four Symbols Secret Realm for even a moment. He was afraid that if he left to find Dao Qiongcang, something would happen here again.</p><p>This was clearly the killing intent of Wei Feng, the God of Killing!</p><p>This time, if Dao Qiongcang did not give him an explanation, he would not be able to justify himself!</p><p>However…</p><p>“How could it happen so suddenly?”</p><p>Demi-saints could not use all of their Fire Power on the Shengshen Continent. This rule was set by the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>If it was not allowed on the Shengshen Continent, it naturally would not be allowed in the extradimensional space too. The three emperors had to act with restraint when they did things.</p><p>“Even the ‘killing intent’ had appeared…”</p><p>“The next step wouldn’t be the God of Killing domain, right? Who provoked this lunatic?”</p><p>Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>“Array Eye No. 36, Zhou Rang, is in position. We have been attacked by Holy Power. This power…”</p><p>“Array Eye No.122, Zhao Cheng is in position. My area was also affected, but I quickly got rid of the killing intent…”</p><p>“Array Eye No.3, Cheng Huan is in position. Did, did Wei Feng make a move? Do we need to retreat?”</p><p>“Ran Ming ruins, Beibei is in position. Hallmaster Dao, I’m stuck in the middle of the Black Water Stream. What should I do next?”</p><p>In an instant, countless messages came from the Heavenly Group’s combat channel.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang, who was at the Diaoyu Isle smiled and moved his finger.</p><p>Everyone who transmitted a report received a response and calmed down. They knew that with the Hallmaster around, things would not be chaotic.</p><p>“Ran Ming ruins, Beibei is in position. Hallmaster Dao, I’m too close. Senior Wei Feng seemed to have gone crazy…” Beibei was anxious.</p><p>“What? What? I am Yue Gongli. I am outside the Four Symbols Secret Realm.  Little girl, why are you stuck in the Black Water Stream? Tell me the details. I am very bored now.”</p><p>“Ran Ming ruins, Beibei is in position. Senior Yue Gongli, I heard…” “What did you hear?” Dao Qiongcang’s voice suddenly interrupted.</p><p>“Uh, Beibei didn’t hear anything.” Beibei suddenly realized that Senior Wei Feng could also hear her through the channel.</p><p>“Then just wait, get closer, but don’t be discovered by the God of Killing domain. Observe and learn well.” God of Killing domain?</p><p>He hadn’t seen this thing yet.</p><p>So Senior Wei Feng would definitely make a move?</p><p>Had everything been planned by Hallmaster Dao in advance?</p><p>“Alright…” Beibei replied in surprise.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, are you crazy? I’m so bored now. Why don’t you let her talk about it…” Yue Gongli’s voice suddenly disappeared from the Heavenly Group’s battle channel.</p><p>After Dao Qiongcang replied to all, his eyes shifted and he sneered.</p><p>He looked at Ai Cangsheng and quickly turned his head back. However, he took another look and then turned around again. His movements were very slight.</p><p>His fingers fiddled with the star dipper on the divine Sinan. His fingertips moved faster than usual and more subconsciously.</p><p>“Speak.”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng did not even turn his head, but the Eyes of the Great Path saw all of this.</p><p>Everyone was eager to share, and Dao Qiongcang was no exception.</p><p>His actions clearly showed that he had discovered some shocking secret. Even with his temperament, he couldn’t suppress it and wanted to share it.</p><p>When he thought about it, it must be related to the sudden killing intent that broke out on Gong Yang Mountain.</p><p>“Your eyes are really sharp.” Dao Qiongcang laughed.</p><p>“I’m not sharp-eyed, I’m just not blind.”</p><p>“Alright, I won’t hide it from you. I discovered something terrifying.”</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“See this?” Dao Qiongcang dipped his cup into the water and dripped it onto the table.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng tilted his head and looked over. It was just a drop of water. It was transparent, pure, and ordinary. There was nothing special about it.</p><p>“Yu Lingdi joined the Saint Servant?” Ai Cangsheng looked up in shock.</p><p>“Uhh.” Dao Qiongcang’s expression froze as he muttered silently, “You’re really bold and unrestrained…”</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>“This is water. Can’t you tell?”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng was silent.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang flicked his finger, and a Divine Array shot out. The water flow on the table began to accelerate.</p><p>Soon, it naturally evaporated and disappeared.</p><p>“What about now?” Dao Qiongcang asked with interest, his eyes filled with excitement. “What did you see?”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng remained silent.</p><p>“It’s gone!” Dao Qiongcang did not need to answer. He slapped his thigh and stood up excitedly, his usual solemn demeanor gone.</p><p>“It’s gone!”</p><p>“It’s actually gone!”</p><p>“It had disappeared from this world, but it still exists in essence… My</p><p>Cangsheng great emperor, do you know how it disappeared?”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng spoke out. After he held it in for a long time, he finally managed to say, “Don’t delve too deeply into the Divine Secret. Be careful that one day, before Wei Feng goes crazy, you will go crazy first.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang sat back down calmly.</p><p>He was indeed a person who wanted to share, but his desire to share was very restrained.</p><p>“Ai Cangsheng, are you really not curious?”</p><p>“Speak.” Ai Cangsheng wasn’t curious at first, but now he really wanted to know why a drop of water could make Dao Qiongcang lose his composure.</p><p>Water, if it wasn’t Yu Lingdi…</p><p>Yu MO was actually a double agent?</p><p>Or could it be that Yu Mo’s father had already risen from his coffin?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked up and leaned back lazily in his chair. He glanced at Ai Cangsheng and said.</p><p>“The Divine cannot be revealed..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
