That’s all.”</p><p>Director Zhou was stunned.</p><p>This Xu Gusheng had figured out all the tricks, but he couldn’t get anything out of him.</p><p>He opened his mouth to ask.</p><p>However Xu Xiaoshou would not let him speak. He used both soft and hard tactics and asked again.</p><p>“Tell me again, what’s with that Rao? Don’t worry, if your backer is so strong, there’s a high chance that you won’t die on this deal. You’ll definitely make a profit!”</p><p>Director Zhou fell silent again.</p><p>He suddenly looked back and realized that he had been completely manipulated by Xu Gusheng since he entered the room.</p><p>Through him, this person quickly dug up information about the Three Incenses. He dug up whatever could and could not be told.</p><p>At this point, it was as he had said. Other than the belief that this deal was a</p><p>‘guaranteed profit’, there was no other way out.</p><p>If he didn’t tell him, he would die.</p><p>If he retreated, he would die.</p><p>If Xu Gusheng’s information was false, he would be executed by the Three Incenses!</p><p>“Young Master Xu, do you know about the Holy Emperor aristocratic family?” Director Zhou sighed and gave up all resistance.</p><p>“About Yue Bei Hua Rao Dao, can’t you tell what kind of person I am?</p><p>Continue.”</p><p>Director Zhou was not surprised.</p><p>This person’s behavior had been so erratic since he appeared at the Three Incenses. It would be strange if there was no one behind him.</p><p>If it were him, he might really be able to take down Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>Director Zhou didn’t have the time to regret that he had gone down to receive Xu Gusheng. Now that he was at a dead end, his desire to live pushed him closer to his only chance of survival.</p><p>He leaned closer to Xu Gusheng. There was even a hint of flattery on his face. “It was Rao before, but it might not be the case now.”</p><p>“Oh, tell me about it.”</p><p>“Young Master Xu, do you know about the Holy Emperor aristocratic family’s official position?”</p><p>“I know a thing or two. I’m willing to hear the details.”</p><p>“It’s like this. I heard that each of the five Holy Emperor aristocratic family had a ‘share’ in their respective eras to descend to the Spiritual Cultivation World…</p><p>Well, to them, this was like a descent from the heavens to the mortal world! The previous representative of the Rao clan was Rao Yaoyao.”</p><p>“Yes, Rao Cutie.”</p><p>“That’s right. I heard that the Saint Servant Lord Shou liked to call her that. Haha…Lady Rao’s official position in the outside world was Rao Cutie, and she was the Ruler of the red-robed people. However, I also know that the Three Incenses had the best level of connection with this Lady Rao.”</p><p>“Was it Lady Rao or this Rao Cutie?”</p><p>“Lady Rao! Rao Cutie was only the Ruler of the red-robed people and her heart was focused on the sword.’</p><p>“That’s true. Otherwise, the sword wouldn’t be so powerful… And now?”</p><p>“It’s different now. It seems that the five Holy Emperor aristocratic family also had disputes before. The Council of Ten of the Holy Divine Palace had changed dynasties. This time, Rao Yaoyao’s position was replaced by a member of the Yue Clan. Even the ‘share’ that we could receive for the Three Incenses was taken by the Yue Clan in advance.”</p><p>This was interesting… Xu Xiaoshou took out his paper fan and tapped the teacup. Director Zhou was sharp and he quickly started to make tea.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts also expanded.</p><p>Yue?</p><p>Yue of Yue Gongnu?</p><p>Would Bazhun’an know if there was a way to go about this?</p><p>The Three Incenses was actually worthy to get the support of the Yue Clan?</p><p>Fortunately, he had only killed a few unimportant people and did not blow up the headquarters…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had made the right decision. After he sipped his tea, he said with interest, “It seems that you can really withstand the counterattack of Xu Xiaoshou and the Saint Servant. Can you really get the people from the Yue Clan?”</p><p>Director Zhou’s eyes were solemn. “If it was Xu Xiaoshou and if the information is true.”</p><p>What Xu Gusheng said was so serious that even the backer behind the Three Incenses had to verify it..</p><p>Director Zhou felt that a great opportunity had arrived.</p><p>This wave of fortune and misfortune depended on one’s own ability.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the invisible Jin Ren in the void and said with a smile, “I only have 70% confidence that I can find Xu Xiaoshou. I want the semi-saint person, but I don’t want Xu Xiaoshou to take revenge. Director Zhou, what do you think I should do?”</p><p>Seventy percent… Director Zhou took a deep breath and his eyes shone.</p><p>That was Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>He came and left without a trace.</p><p>He was ever-changing and was an Intangible killer.</p><p>Even if he appeared in front of him, Director Zhou was not sure if he could recognize Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>This sickly young master, 70%?</p><p>“Young Master Xu, what exactly have you mastered?” Director Zhou looked intently at the person in front of him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew the phrase-‘rare goods can be hoarded’. He also knew that some people could come out on their own with a little trick in order to survive.</p><p>He leaned back and placed his hands on the back of the wooden bench. He smiled. “I can tell you, but are you sure you can catch the meaning of my words?”</p><p>Director Zhou gulped and hesitated.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a step back. “If you can’t handle it, call the highest level person you can get in contact with. My guard tampered with the spiritual array here. It won’t record the contents of our conversation just now, so you can become an outsider who doesn’t know anything.”</p><p>It would not be recorded?</p><p>In other words, the conversation just now was between the Heavens and the earth, between you and me?</p><p>Director Zhou felt that he was being looked down upon. This Xu Gusheng was deliberately distancing himself from him.</p><p>The opportunity to extricate himself from this matter was indeed rare.</p><p>However, the chance to become one of the elites in the Three Incenses was even more tempting.</p><p>Director Zhou made a decision in an instant. He clenched his fists and said firmly.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, after our long chat today, it is impossible for me to leave this matter alone. You also know some things about me…”</p><p>“How about this, you can contact me on your own regarding the matter of the Saint Servant Lord Shou.”</p><p>“I’ll definitely get you the highest level of resources and help from the Three Incenses. I’ll also guard your personal information during the operation and would not let any third party be aware of your existence.”</p><p>“This way, unless Xu Xiaoshou finds me and kills me, you will never be exposed! How about it?”</p><p>The sickly young master seemed to smile when he heard this. He said directly, “This way, I won’t be exposed, but I won’t be able to come into contact with the Yue family. As the one-way contact, you will be able to obtain the greatest benefits.</p><p>Director Zhou chuckled. This person was really not easy to fool…</p><p>“Young Master Xu, I’ll be frank with you. Other than the reward you deserve, half of the reward after this matter will be yours and the other half will be mine.”</p><p>“Moreover, if I become one of the managers at the Three Incenses, with Young Master Xu’s ability, and if we cooperate like this again, we…” Director Zhou paused and made a throwing gesture.</p><p>“A wise choice to cast a long line to catch a big fish.” The sickly Young Master nodded and changed the topic. “I’ll take 70% and you’ll take 30%”</p><p>“Hiss!” Director Zhou couldn’t help but gasp. This Xu Gusheng was too ruthless!</p><p>The more painful it was, the more clear-headed one would be, and the more real the world would be… Xu Xiaoshou smiled as he looked at the greedy Director Zhou, who would do anything to satisfy his desires. He knew that after today, even if what he wanted to do was fake, Director Zhou would do everything he could to make it happen.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had some experience in the art of controlling subordinates.</p><p>“If I can help you to be successful, I can also destroy you.” He said calmly as he fanned himself.</p><p>“Deal!” Director Zhou didn’t hesitate any longer and immediately agreed.</p><p>Finally, he said.</p><p>“Then we’re on the same side now…”</p><p>“May I ask Young Master Xu, where did your guard Jin Ren meet Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>At this moment, in Director Zhou’s eyes, Xu Xiaoshou was no longer Lord Shou but a stepping stone for advancement, a stepping stone to climb higher levels and a future that would amaze everyone with a single feat!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the man and smiled without saying a word.</p><p>He finally looked away, tapped the tea lightly with his fingertips and left two words on the table.</p><p>“He Ting.]’</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
