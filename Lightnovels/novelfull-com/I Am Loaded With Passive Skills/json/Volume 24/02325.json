The Ran Ming ruins are about to emerge!”</p><p>“What are the Ran Ming ruins?”</p><p>“You haven’t heard of the Ran Ming ruins? You’re so outdated! Have you heard of the god slayer Ran Ming? Rumor has it that his combat strength can rival ten ancestors. He wields dual axes, one for slaying gods and one for hunting demons, capable of severing the power of the ancestral source!”</p><p>“What is the power of the ancestral source?”</p><p>“You… Forget it. My mom told me not to talk to fools.” “Hey, don’t be like that. I’m curious too. Tell me!”</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>“Your information is totally unreliable. I don’t know where you heard it from. I have something more exciting here, from a very reliable source. Wanna hear</p><p>“Oh? Tell me. I don’t believe there’s anything more sensational than the emergence of the Ran Ming ruins. It’s comparable to the descent of the Sky City in the Eastern Region!”</p><p>“Well, let me enlighten you… Have you heard of the He Ting Mountain among the Three Mountains?”</p><p>“Naturally, didn’t He Ting Mountain gain fame with the Five Evil Guys back then?”</p><p>“Then you must have heard of the former king of the intelligence world, Fen Qin?”</p><p>“Fen Qin Zhu He, Sleeveless Saint Servant, who doesn’t know about him?”</p><p>“You’re quite knowledgeable. But do you know that there have been rumors about He Ting Mountain recently? Someone obtained the inheritance of the</p><p>Infernal Lineage.”</p><p>“Oh? The Sleeveless Saint Servant, the Saint Servant Lord Shou’s lineage? Rumor has it that they have invincible physical bodies, comparable to the Divine?”</p><p>“Exactly. Someone in the He Ting Mountain obtained the Fire Seed from the Ashvattha divine tree, cultivated the Infernal Fire, achieved the ultimate physical body, and even received an improved version of the Penetrating</p><p>Divine Senses 2.0, which is the signature move of Sleeveless Saint Servant…” “Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand?”</p><p>“Yes! Not only that, it is said that many higher void individuals with the potential to become Saints fell during the battle between the White-Clothed People and Fen Qin. Many people who visit the He Ting Mountain nowadays are often led into various shattered Higher Void Worlds, but they also gain various benefits! ”</p><p>“Is your information reliable?”</p><p>“It’s highly probable. Many people are rushing to the He Ting Mountain to seek opportunities. Some even claim to have seen Lord Shou, the prospective Seven Sword Deity!”</p><p>“Lord Shou welcomed by Hua Lai Bei Tian? Are you sure? I like him…”</p><p>“Besides him, who else could it be? Many ancient swordsmen from the Eastern and Southern Regions are heading to the He Ting Mountain, aiming to make a name for themselves and become Sword Deities!”</p><p>“Are they risking their lives for fame? Lord Shou has defeated Sword Deity Rao… Oh, the Sword Saint, I guess his strength is beyond the Seventh Sword</p><p>Deity.”</p><p>“We don’t know about that, but I also want to go to the He Ting Mountain to join in the fun. With so many people going, even if we can’t witness the battle for Sword Deity titles, we might witness many battles of Cutting Path and higher void levels. Do you want to come with me?”</p><p>“Sure, why not? I wonder if I’ll get to see someone transcending the tribulation. I really want to see how the Nine Death Thunder Calamity is overcome. I’m quite uncertain.”</p><p>“You’re just… cough, talk about your Ran Ming ruins. Where did you hear about</p><p>“There’s not much extra information about the Ran Ming ruins. It’s very secretive, and I had to pay a hefty price just to hear what I mentioned earlier. I heard that the Ran Ming ruins had caused a stir before, but it was suppressed by the Holy Divine Palace.” “Do they want to monopolize it?”</p><p>“Well, that’s unclear…”</p><p>“Hiss! Why does it feel like your information is more reliable? Where is the Ran Ming ruins? I also want to join the fun.”</p><p>“You? You’re not qualified!”</p><p>“Nonsense, I’m almost at the Sovereign Stage, while you’ve just entered the Master Stage of the Star Worship. How dare you judge me?”</p><p>“The Ran Ming ruins will be located in the Four Symbols Secret Realm.” “Ah? This…</p><p>It was as if the Jade Capital City had gained several invisible hands, subtly stirring up waves.</p><p>What everyone discussed after meals, besides the He Ting Mountain, was the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>Every street, exotic pavilion, tavern, and teahouse in the city… was immersed in these discussions.</p><p>Even the various major sects, families, and factions, as well as the lower levels of secret organizations, were all sharing information about the Infernal Lineage and the Ran Ming ruins.</p><p>The former was unquestionably powerful, with the Sleeveless Saint Servant and the Lord Shou of the Saint Servants—the Infernal Lineage was formidable.</p><p>To obtain such an inheritance through official channels, one had to excel in the Holy Palace Trial, and ultimately be chosen by the Infernal Lineage.</p><p>But sometimes, in an entire era, the Holy Palace would only choose one person.</p><p>How many talented individuals were there in the world?</p><p>When would such destiny fall upon oneself?</p><p>Hence, many were drawn to the Infernal Lineage of the He Ting Mountain.</p><p>After all, it produced Fen Qin Zhu He, later known as the Sleeveless Saint Servant, making its authenticity very high.</p><p>Its credibility was high enough to even alert the Holy Palace.</p><p>More than one person had seen a violent woman presumably of the Infernal Lineage, carrying a large bathtub on He Ting Mountain months ago, apparently looking for someone, perhaps even trying to reclaim the Infernal inheritance.</p><p>Once this news spread, the He Ting Mountain was thrust into the spotlight even more.</p><p>Some even wanted to challenge a girl named Hua Ying to prove that their inheritance was not weaker than the Infernal Lineage. It was said that the person found her, but he was thrashed…</p><p>True or false, it was hard to say.</p><p>As for the Ran Ming ruins, most people below the Sovereign Stage were ignorant about it and even if they knew, they didn’t care.</p><p>Only some elites from certain factions received the information and understood the power of the ancestral source. They could see that the intelligence appeared unreal but had a higher credibility.</p><p>“Some people want to seize a piece of the Holy Divine Palace’s flesh…”</p><p>Smart individuals could figure out that, in the current world, only one faction had the audacity to openly declare war on the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>The Saint Servant!</p><p>It was undoubtedly a message released by the Saint Servant.</p><p>Their goal was the Ran Ming ruins in the Four Symbols Secret Realm, and indeed, information about its emergence had been previously suppressed. Leaders of major factions were, to some extent, aware of this..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
