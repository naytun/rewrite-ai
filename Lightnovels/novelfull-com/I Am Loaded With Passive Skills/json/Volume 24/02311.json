He was just a guard and could not afford to offend these killers.</p><p>“So, you haven’t seen me today.”</p><p>“Yes, yes.”</p><p>“Do you know what to say if someone from the Holy Divine Palace came over?” Xu Xiaoshou asked with a smile.</p><p>The old man stammered.</p><p>He was scared. This dog was being pursued by the Holy Divine Palace and still came here. Wasn’t this dragging people down with him?</p><p>But before he could say anything, the sickly young master slapped a golden command token on the table.</p><p>The golden light flashed and disappeared.</p><p>The old man’s legs went soft, and he was so shocked that he was speechless.</p><p>Gold hunting token!</p><p>This was actually a gold hunting token killer!</p><p>“Hmm?” Xu Xiaoshou smiled faintly.</p><p>“What are you talking about, Young Master? I haven’t seen anything here today.” Being targeted by the Holy Divine Palace might not necessarily mean death, but being targeted by a gold hunting token killer would definitely mean death. The old man knew this very well.</p><p>“Good.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded in satisfaction. He waved his hand and gestured for the two women to walk toward the teleportation portal.</p><p>The old man hesitated for a moment. When he looked at the two women who appeared so delicate, he could not help but say.</p><p>“Young Master isn’t wearing a mask? I have some here… Oh, it’s free today,</p><p>Young Master can take whatever you want.”</p><p>These two lambs were about to enter the black market without any disguise.</p><p>Were they about to be sent to be slaughtered?</p><p>Who wouldn’t cover their faces when they came here? Who would dare to be so flamboyant?</p><p>“We’ll take two!”</p><p>As soon as Xu Xiaoshou spoke, Jin Ren took out two masks and threw them to Yingying and Qiao’er</p><p>This was indeed a mask that could block out one’s spiritual senses.</p><p>It was strange that such a magical creation was created in this small rundown shop. The Divine Secret contained in the masks was minimal.</p><p>The two women fiddled with the masks and felt disgusted. They knew that the Three Incenses was not a good place, so they quickly put on the masks. The old man looked at the two girls who suddenly became unusually eye-catching after they put on the masks and sighed to himself.</p><p>What’s with the additional spice…</p><p>“What about the Young Master?” He turned around and grabbed another mask and did not have time to care about anything else.</p><p>“What you see may not be true.” Xu Xiaoshou closed his fan and had a fake smile on his face. He smiled stiffly at the old man and said, “Human skin mask.”</p><p>Buzz.</p><p>The teleportation portal was activated.</p><p>The old man stared at the strange face and felt a chill in his heart.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou kept in mind the spatial node that the teleportation portal led to even as he joked around.</p><p>For the space attributes Spiritual Cultivator, they had to either personally experience the scene or remember the location of the space nodes.</p><p>After that, within a short distance, all the teleportation portals could be used as decorations.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could go to the so-called Saint Killer Hall at any time and place. He could stay hidden, escape, or explode on a whim.</p><p>Of course, the Three Incenses seemed to have taken precautions.</p><p>The teleportation portal sent the two women away first.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou walked up, the spiritual array was activated again, but the aura of the space node that led to it changed.</p><p>“There’s a camouflage?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was surprised, but he felt that it was reasonable.</p><p>It wasn’t a good thing if others could find the space node of the Three Incenses base camp too easily.</p><p>However, these methods were child’s play for a space attributes Spiritual Cultivator. Although, with Xu Xiaoshou’s current half-baked level, it would take a lot of effort to catch the real space node behind the mask.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t move and was teleported away in the teleportation portal by the power of the spiritual array.</p><p>However, Jin Ren remained in the shop.</p><p>He revealed his true form once again. When the short old man looked at him in surprise…</p><p>“Soul reading!”</p><p>The old man’s eyes became dull.</p><p>A Space Dao Disc appeared beneath Jin Ren’s feet.</p><p>After he entered the Unity of Man and the Heavens state, in just three breaths of time, he had analyzed the true location of the space node for the Three Incenses.</p><p>He did not step into the teleportation portal.</p><p>On the contrary, he took a step out of the teleportation portal, but his figure also disappeared.</p><p>Three Incenses.</p><p>This low-key Saint Killer Hall was located at the end of the underground black market in Jade Capital City. It was sparsely furnished.</p><p>The only eye-catching thing was the blood-black symbol on the door. There was an incense altar carved on it with three incense sticks stuck onto it and they burned quietly.</p><p>If one were to enter the headquarters from the underground black market, they would have to go through multiple spiritual arrays to verify their identity.</p><p>Once the procedures were not in order, they would not even be able to take out the red hunting token and the spiritual array would turn into a killing array.</p><p>However, it was different for those who were teleported into the Saint Killer Hall through various external points. They could directly enter the hall.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had obtained this information when he did the Soul Reading of several gold hunting token killers.</p><p>“Buzz.”</p><p>The noise in the hall fell silent.</p><p>Everyone looked in the direction of the teleportation portal that had made the sound.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, these ‘points’ in the outside world were known by gold hunting token killers and a few excellent purple hunting token killers.</p><p>However, there were very few red hunting token killers who knew these points.</p><p>However, this time, what came out of the teleportation portal was not a murderous killer, but two delicate girls who wore masks.</p><p>“Shh!”</p><p>Wolf whistles rang out in the hall.</p><p>When a killer looked at another killer, they could tell at a glance, even if he was in disguise, that they were in the same profession. The killing intent accumulated over the years could not be easily dispelled!</p><p>However, when a killer looked at an outsider, it was very different. Even if an outsider wore a mask, in the eyes of the experts in the Three Incenses headquarters, it was no different from being naked.</p><p>Everyone in the hall could tell at a glance. Not only were these two women of unknown realms not killers, but their cultivation level was also extremely weak..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
