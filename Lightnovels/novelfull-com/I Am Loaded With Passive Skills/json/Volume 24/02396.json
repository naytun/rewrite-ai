After Situ Yongren’s death, she was the first on the heavenly ranking of the Path Division. She was also the head of the younger generation’s Divine Secret energy movement.</p><p>The direct combat strength of a Divine Sorceress could be said to be very low. Even Dao Qiongcang suffered when he entered Abyss Island, let alone Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>However, in terms of the power of planning, if a Divine Sorceress had made preparations beforehand, she could not be underestimated.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated for a moment before he said to the Frost Ferret, who was about to come out of the Apricot Realm.</p><p>“You don’t have to come out yet.”</p><p>“This Divine Secret person is not weak. Even if you were prepared and used your escape techniques, I’m afraid you would still be discovered.”</p><p>The Frost Ferret was so frightened that it trembled. It glanced at the hateful woman who stood at the top of the tower who gave off a ‘I’m very weak’ vibe.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened up his ‘Independence’.</p><p>He didn’t even use the Vanishing Technique. Instead, he leaped and landed on the Vermilion Bird Golden Tower.</p><p>In the dark sky, the Galaxy hung in the distance.</p><p>The Pearl Tower of the Vermilion Bird Golden Tower was huge enough to accommodate two people standing side by side.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou silently appeared behind Yu Zhiwen. He was so close that he could already smell the familiar fragrance on Little Yu’s body.</p><p>That head that was one head shorter was soft and easy to rub.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suppressed his urge and looked down.</p><p>“Da da da…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen fiddled with an astrolabe in her hand. The divine path patterns on it were even more complicated than the vast stars.</p><p>Today was different from the past. Xu Xiaoshou no longer needed Yu Zhiwen to teach him and easily saw through the mysteries of the astrolabe.</p><p>This was to locate any suspicious people near the Vermilion Bird Golden Tower. Once an existence that exceeded the standard appeared nearby, it would be displayed on the astrolabe.</p><p>The trial takers were displayed in green.</p><p>However, there was a faint red glow in the northeast direction of the astrolabe.</p><p>“It’s not an illusion?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen mumbled to herself as she looked in the direction. She realized that there really was a suspicious presence.</p><p>However, that person seemed to have just passed by and did not stay. Or rather, he died very quickly as soon as he appeared.</p><p>Only then would the red marking on the astrolabe fade away and return to nothingness.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could tell that it was the position of his portrait clone.</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>At the center of the astrolabe next to Yu Zhiwen, there was an eye-catching red light that flashed furiously.</p><p>He did not use the Vanishing Technique, so the astrolabe marked his existence.</p><p>However, he had activated the Independence, so even though the astrolabe reminded her, Yu Zhiwen subconsciously forgot to pay attention to it.</p><p>“Silly… ”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s playful spirit was aroused as he aimed his hand at the back of Little Yu’s head.</p><p>He could already imagine how funny the ‘ouch’ sound would be.</p><p>However, his smile suddenly disappeared and he stopped his movements.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen wore a black earring that looked like the one Aunt Xiang gave him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a person who paid great attention to details.</p><p>He had seen the same thing on Ao Sheng, Wei Feng, and Beibei.</p><p>He was awakened.</p><p>This was not the White Cave, but the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>He had many Saint Servants behind him, and Little Yu also had the Heavenly Group behind her.</p><p>The joke played in the White Cave, was something that made his life and death a huge risk now.</p><p>The wind in the Vermilion Bird Golden Tower was very strong, but it could not blow away the frustration that had arisen in his heart for a moment. It was as if as people grew up, troubles would follow.</p><p>Above the Nine Heavens, the starlight was scattered. The faint light elongated the two shadows on the Pearl Tower that no one had noticed.</p><p>Silently.</p><p>One of them disappeared.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen took a deep breath and turned around.</p><p>The Pearl Gem Star Eyes lit up in the darkness at this moment without any hesitation and was extremely beautiful.</p><p>She could not see anyone behind her.</p><p>However, it was just like how Xu Xiaoshou could feel the fragrance.</p><p>As the wind blew, Yu Zhiwen also smelled a familiar scent.</p><p>Her starry eyes could not see anyone, but her sense of smell told her with absolute certainty…</p><p>“He is here!”</p><p>“He was just here!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
