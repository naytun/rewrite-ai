How dare you disrespect me?”</p><p>The paper fan dropped.</p><p>The sickly young master coldly pointed at the person in front of him. His lips twitched and he was extremely indifferent as he said.</p><p>“Leave no one alive.”</p><p>With a boom, dozens of spiritual source fluctuations exploded in the hall at the same time. There were Dao Realm, Cutting Path Stage and even the higher void level.</p><p>These killers who had just gathered there and wanted to taunt the the sick young master felt that Xu Gusheng was not the one who was crazy; rather they were the ones and the world in front of them.</p><p>How could such a lawless young man suddenly appear in the Three Incenses?</p><p>Did he really think that he could deceive the masses and and surpass the laws of the Dark World?</p><p>However, no matter how Xu Gusheng would be held accountable by the Three Incenses later, that Jin Ren’s strength should not be underestimated. They had to be on guard…</p><p>“Bang bang!”</p><p>A dozen muffled explosions rang out in the hall, and in an instant, seventeen Dao Realm fell.</p><p>These people were no exception. They either had red hunting tokens that hung from their waists or were already well known in the dark world. They didn’t need a command token to make people fear them in this place where the good and the bad mixed together.</p><p>However, at this moment, in the blink of an eye, they couldn’t even activate their spiritual techniques to protect themselves and fell together.</p><p>They all died in the same manner as White Wolf.</p><p>There were holes in their foreheads and death was inevitable.</p><p>“Puff!” The sickly young master seemed to have really gone crazy. He held the paper fan and laughed out loud. As he guided the guard to kill others, he kept up his mocking stance.</p><p>“How dare you?”</p><p>“You’re all so weak. How dare you tease people so randomly?”</p><p>“You’ve been in the industry for so many years, and it wasn’t easy for you all to protect your lives. Why are you so blind now? Why did you work so hard only to give it away?”</p><p>The killers in the hall who were not part of the group earlier had already silently retreated to the corners. Each of them used all of their skills to try and defend themselves against this somewhat crazy sickly young master.</p><p>“This is really a lunatic!”</p><p>Masters were not scary.</p><p>Which one of them here wasn’t a master killer? It was great to defeat the strong for the weak!</p><p>What was scary was that some masters could kill people with their bare feet and would not consider the consequences at all.</p><p>This was the type of person that all killers were most unwilling to face.</p><p>Xu Gusheng scared these killers who were used to survival in a well-established dark system.</p><p>He suddenly appeared and tore the rules into pieces. He was so arrogant that it was as if he was the first king of heavens the world and they were the second.</p><p>“Kill them!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not know what those people’s thoughts were. He was really annoyed.</p><p>He looked down on these killers.</p><p>If it was possible, he even wanted Jin Ren to kill everyone present, not just the group earlier.</p><p>It started with Feng Kong from the Three Incenses in the Tiansang Spirit</p><p>Palace, followed by Red Dog from Dongtianwang City, Golden Foot and Little Ninja from the deep sea, Double Dumba*s, Elder Xie, Ghost Granny from Abyss Island, and everyone in the hall before him…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou really had no sympathy for these killers at all!</p><p>These annoying flies dared to come up and bite you when they smelled the fragrance of cake. They lacked any principles and would even suck your blood dry.</p><p>It was still fine if he was in his peak state, he could suppress them with a backhand.</p><p>If he encountered them when he was weak, he might really be killed and all his important stuff would be taken away.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou swore that he was not here to cause trouble.</p><p>However, he seemed to be at odds with these ‘killers’ and would always end up like this.</p><p>However, when I was weak, I could not fight back and almost fell into Red Dog’s hands…</p><p>What era are we in now?</p><p>These people still dared to act rashly?</p><p>“Kill them all!”</p><p>The air pressure in the hall was so low that it seemed to freeze. Yingying and Qiao’er looked fearfully at the sickly young master’s back.</p><p>They had thought that Young Master Xu was the owner of the Three Incenses and that he was here to issue a mission and offer a reward for a certain someone.</p><p>When they looked at it now…</p><p>Young Master Xu seemed to hold a grudge against the killers in the Three Incenses!</p><p>Otherwise, why would a nice person like him throw a tantrum over such a small matter and kick up such a fuss?</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>The Three Incenses’ attendants who were all masked could not hide their panic. “Young Master Xu, stop!”</p><p>However, they were not even at the Sovereign Dao Realm. They were just service staff.</p><p>They helped to pour the wine and felt it was fine to be secretly touched and teased, but how could they stop the sickly young master’s bad temper?</p><p>“Shut up. If you say it again, you’ll die.”</p><p>The paper fan that said ‘I am Xu Gusheng’ only swirled around once. Not only did the attendants shut up, but even the killers who watched the battle secretly wanted to leave.</p><p>“Bang bang bang…”</p><p>The dull sounds in the air continued.</p><p>The Sovereign Dao Realm were the first to be killed. The remaining Cutting</p><p>Path Stage were a little difficult to deal with. After all, they had already reacted.</p><p>However, the overbearing Life Point Finger could penetrate the defense of the</p><p>Cutting Path Stage every time.</p><p>A sound rang out.</p><p>A life gone.</p><p>More and more corpses fell in the hall.</p><p>The Cutting Path Stage were all dead. The Cutting Path Stage that had passed the Nine Death Thunder Calamity would also be targeted by the god of death.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, I was wrong. Please spare my life!” Finally, someone couldn’t hold back the panic in his heart and shouted.</p><p>These words seemed to work. The sickly young master looked back and nodded. “It’s good that you know your mistakes and are willing to correct them.”</p><p>“Thank you…”</p><p>“Did I ask you to thank me?” Bang!</p><p>Another Cutting Path lost his life.</p><p>“If an apology is of use, wouldn’t this young master really become a good horse that can be bullied?”</p><p>Killing people were like slaughtering dogs. Seize the path with a nod.</p><p>How could it be easy to cultivate to the Sovereign Stage, let alone become a killer who was most proficient in life-saving techniques?</p><p>However, in the eyes of the sickly young master, the Sovereign Dao Realm, the Cutting Path Stage and even the Cutting Path Stage of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity were all worthless!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
