How could they take half a step forward?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was famous for seeking revenge for the smallest grievance!</p><p>After this person became famous, his dark history was dug up.</p><p>At that time, he was still weak. A person named Zhang Xinxiong offended him; afterward he and the entire Zhang family were destroyed.</p><p>Among them, Xu Xiaoshou was even suspected to have made use of the red-clothed people</p><p>All killers cherished their lives, so who would dare to look down on such a petty person now?</p><p>Even if they did find traces of Xu Xiaoshou, they might not even dare to report him. They were afraid that if Xu Xiaoshou could not be killed, they would be plotted against by that troublemaker in the future.</p><p>But this Xu Gusheng…</p><p>Should it be said that this was a newborn calf that was not afraid of a tiger?</p><p>Or was he simply audacious and arrogant?</p><p>“He’s really crazy!”</p><p>“Yes, he thought he could do it after he annihilated all the killers here.”</p><p>“As everyone is aware, a mere higher void level is nothing in Lord Shou’s eyes. As for those below the higher void… they are not even worthy to be within Lord Shou’s sight.”</p><p>“That’s right. I heard that Lord Shou’s opponent in the Sky City was a demi-saint, but there was no limit to his strength. He even beat up Hallmaster</p><p>Dao.”</p><p>“Shh! Stop this telepathic communication. I suspect that he can hear me. He’s also… No, that guard of his isn’t weak either.”</p><p>The hall was silent.</p><p>However, there were many people who whispered secretly to each other.</p><p>When they noticed Xu Gusheng’s indistinct glance, they immediately quieted down.</p><p>In this regard even though Golden Foot, Double Dumba*s and the rest were here, but if the actual Ruler of the Three Incenses was present, then Xu Gusheng would not dare to be so presumptuous… Someone thought bitterly to himself.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, please come to the second floor.”</p><p>The director of the Three Incenses lowered his head respectfully.</p><p>He already had a high regard for Xu Gusheng, but when he heard what he said, he couldn’t hide his surprise.</p><p>It was not without good reason that the Black Gold Bounty for Xu Xiaoshou could be raised to such a generous level in such a short period of time. That guy was even more difficult to deal with than a gold hunting token killer!</p><p>Therefore, regardless whether the information provided by Xu Gusheng was true or not, the director was convinced from the bottom of his heart since he had the courage to say that he wanted to accept the Black Gold Bounty.</p><p>During this period of time, the gold hunting token killers he was in charge of either disappeared like Elder Xie, or all of them had rejected Lord Shou’s bounty.</p><p>“Lead the way.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t say anything else. Under the respectful gazes of the crowd, he followed the director to the room on the second floor.</p><p>The door closed.</p><p>The spiritual array lit up.</p><p>The Soundproof Barrier was also activated.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t need to do much to break it. With just a glance, he knew that this spiritual array couldn’t cause him any harm.</p><p>A third Sovereign Stage spiritual array could be easily broken.</p><p>The director’s face did not change and the possibility of him turning into Dao Qiongcang was very small.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to be crazy, but he knew that the Three Incenses was a complicated place and he had to constantly be on guard.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, please take a seat.”</p><p>The director smiled and bowed as he poured the tea. “My surname is Zhou. Young Master, you can call me by any name.”</p><p>“Yes, Xiao Zhou.”</p><p>Director Zhou’s hands trembled and he almost spilled the tea. After he calmed down, he looked up and smiled. “Did Young Master Xu really mean what he said?”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, he saw the sickly young master’s unfriendly gaze shoot over. “Did my comment sound like I’m farting?”</p><p>Was this person a hedgehog? His words were so piercing… Director Zhou’s mouth twitched. He respectfully handed over the tea and apologized. “It’s my fault. Young Master Xu’s words are very important. My ears are not good. Young Master Xu, please don’t take it to heart.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took the tea and glanced at it. The relevant ‘Cooking Expert’ information flashed in his mind.</p><p>The conclusion was that it was not poisonous.</p><p>Only then did he raise his eyes and seriously sized up Director Zhou.</p><p>This fat, big eared higher void level.</p><p>A villain who had a knife hidden behind his smile.</p><p>He hid his murderous aura very well. He probably hadn’t killed many people in recent years, but he must have been a killer in the past.</p><p>This was the third time Xu Xiaoshou had met a higher void who would compromise to protect himself.</p><p>“If your ears are not good, go and get them treated. If you don’t know how to speak, get someone else to serve me…”</p><p>After he took a sip of tea, Xu Gusheng’s hostility seemed to have dissipated a little.</p><p>“Not bad, it’s good tea!”</p><p>“If Director Zhou is a higher void, then how many more are there at the Three Incenses?” He changed the topic.</p><p>Director Zhou smiled apologetically. He thought to himself, “Are you asking or am I asking? Is this serious business?’</p><p>“Not many. They do all the odd jobs around here.” He said calmly.</p><p>“How many is not many?”</p><p>“You’re not allowed to tell? Not convenient to say it? Or are you looking down on me and don’t want to tell me?”</p><p>Even Director Zhou, who was a powerful person, was pushed so forcibly that he had to mask his expression. He hurriedly said, “No, no, Young Master Xu.</p><p>There are seven or eight directors like me in the Three Incenses .”</p><p>“Can seven or eight people manage such a big headquarters? How could they control so many gold hunting token killers? Are you stupid or do you think I’m stupid and easy to deceive?” The sickly young master’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>“Tell me the truth. I’m just curious. This shouldn’t involve any secrets at the Three Incenses, right? Of course, if you really can’t tell me, I won’t force you.” Director Zhou’s face was completely white.</p><p>He felt that the atmosphere around him had suddenly turned cold; he had the feeling that he had not entered his own room, but rather, a den of thieves and wolves!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
