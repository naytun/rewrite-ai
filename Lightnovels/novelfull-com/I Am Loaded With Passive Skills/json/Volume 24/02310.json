There should be a pair of eyes that watched from afar, right?</p><p>It was already an exaggeration for the Yougui Pavilion to take in a troublemaker, Xu Gusheng. If ten more extraordinary people rushed in, they would simply be walking into a trap.</p><p>Then, how should the rest of them meet?</p><p>Did Aunt Xiang reveal the true identity of ‘Xu Gusheng’ to the people of the First Pavilion in the Sky after she got in touch with them?</p><p>“I’m afraid it can’t be done.’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou understood this clearly.</p><p>Aunt Xiang was able to find the people from the First Pavilion in the Sky because she had practiced her cultivation in seclusion on Abyss Island.</p><p>There was a high chance that the people from the First Pavilion in the Sky were already waiting outside.</p><p>Bazhun’an was aware of this location, and Aunt Xiang had informed them.</p><p>However, when those capable people blended into the secular world, Xu Xiaoshou was not confident that he could inform them one by one.</p><p>Aunt Xiang was in the Jade Capital City, and it was difficult to control the</p><p>Central Region, let alone reach out to the Eastern Region to inform everyone.</p><p>“I am in danger…”</p><p>“They would be able to guess my identity…”</p><p>“Old Man Li probably knew about me on the first day. He was clearly waiting for me at the carriage. However, he might not have been sure of my identity at that time, so he did not reveal too much information. Today, he gave too many signals…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought about this carefully.</p><p>On the way into the city, Old Man Li talked non-stop about the world. After they entered the Exotic Pavilion, he was even familiar with the new Seven Sword Deity.</p><p>Now, he indirectly revealed the inside story of the Three Incenses and gave him information about the Ghost God Gang and the infiltration of the Holy Divine Palace to him.</p><p>At that time, when Xu Xiaoshou received these information, he put it down to Old Man Li’s ‘life experiences’.</p><p>Now that he heard the phrase ‘far away’ , he would naturally match the phrase ‘close at hand’ in his heart.</p><p>“Old Man Li, is one of ours!”</p><p>But how could there be such a smart person in the First Pavilion in the Sky? I couldn’t even see through his disguise on the first day?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed aloud.</p><p>He thought of the ordinary guy he had just met. He looked ordinary and had an ordinary name. His existence itself had the ‘stealth’ characteristic, so he could easily blend into the crowd and engage in complicated and dangerous intelligence work.</p><p>His surname was also Li.</p><p>“Young Master?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou snapped back to his senses when he heard Yingying and Qiao’er’s voices.</p><p>He stood at the entrance of the shop and stopped smiling. He casually threw out a black bag embroidered with cloud patterns that contained Spirit Crystals inside.</p><p>“I’ll rent your carriage for a month. Wait for me to come out.” “Alright.” Old Man Li took the bag and weighed it in his hand. His eyebrows jumped with joy as he drove the horse into the shade of the tree.</p><p>He hadn’t put on any show up until now!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew why Li Fugui didn’t reveal her identity and didn’t even trust Aunt Xiang. She only met him in secret in this way.</p><p>One, this was Jade Capital City, right under Dao Qiongcang’s nose.</p><p>Secondly, he had indeed stirred up trouble. If she followed too closely and if he was exposed, it would be the same as her being exposed. Then, her future missions would be very difficult.</p><p>Third, Li Fugui was a person who made her priorities very clear. When she was still in the Flower Pavilion, no matter how she was being persuaded, she would not be moved. Now that she had joined the First Pavilion in the Sky, she naturally did not like Aunt Xiang, who was not even a Saint Servant Nine Thrones. She only served one master.</p><p>“Let’s go in.”</p><p>Yingying and Qiao’er seemed to want to ask more but Xu Xiaoshou silenced them with a glance. Without the guidance of the Holy Emperor, the power of the Swallow the Mountains and Rivers made them lose any unnecessary thoughts.</p><p>The grocery store was very old.</p><p>There were many cabinets inside.</p><p>The spiritual arrays used on it included some things that were not of high quality and were not even at the Sovereign Stage rank.</p><p>However, there were many varied dazzling arrays.</p><p>There was a long table in the innermost part of the shop. There was an incense burner on the table against the wall. The outside of the incense burner was covered in ashes, but there was not a single incense stick on the incense burner.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fanned himself and looked at the short old man with half-closed eyes who lazed on the recliner behind the table.</p><p>“What do you want? Find it yourself.” The old man yawned.</p><p>Normally, he would be able to hear the conversation outside the shop.</p><p>Unfortunately, Xu Xiaoshou was not an ordinary person and could change the normal situation.</p><p>By the time he realized what was going on, he had already secretly tampered with the store’s spiritual array.</p><p>The old man heard the first half of the conversation between him and Old Man Li, but he didn’t hear the rest.</p><p>Even though Xu Xiaoshou had already stepped into the store at that time.</p><p>Yingying and Qiao’er were about to ask how to operate the incense burner when the sickly young master beside them raised his sleeve slightly.</p><p>“Jin Ren.”</p><p>The invisible guard appeared out of nowhere and took out three incense sticks.</p><p>The tips of the incense sticks spontaneously ignited without any fire.</p><p>Jin Ren didn’t even have to bow. He then threw three incense sticks into the incense burner.</p><p>Yingying and Qiao’er looked at each other silently, stunned by this skillful move.</p><p>He even brought his own incense…</p><p>Young Master Xu was indeed a regular customer of the Three Incenses. He often used money to buy people, right?</p><p>The wooden recliner creaked, and the old man stood up in shock. He hurriedly turned the vase on the cabinet that was against the wall behind him.</p><p>The wooden table cracked open, and a teleportation portal lit up.</p><p>“This way please.” The old man extended his hand, his eyes filled with respect.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t enter immediately.. Instead, he used the memory from the Soul Reading and asked skillfully, “How many people are aware of this point?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
