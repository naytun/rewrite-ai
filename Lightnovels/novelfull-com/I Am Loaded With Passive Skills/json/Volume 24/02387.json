He could not help but be stunned.</p><p>What was this?</p><p>A new form of humiliation?</p><p>In the path of slaughter, one could only survive after death. To him, this battle was only the beginning and not the end.</p><p>Wei Feng propped himself up with the Yama’s Banquet and jumped up.</p><p>But he hadn’t even lifted his blade, the God of Killing Domain also hadn’t bloomed once again, when Feng Yujin stretched out his hand and looked over solemnly:</p><p>“Don’t make any moves first. Let’s pause for a while before we fight!”</p><p>Pause?</p><p>Wei Feng was instantly stunned. He held the Yama’s Banquet and was uncertain if he should still draw his sword.</p><p>A scheme?</p><p>How did it come to this?</p><p>He was a Holy Emperor, there was no need for that!</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>Jin Ren also asked.</p><p>Feng Yujin had the upper hand. He could have killed Wei Feng, but he chose to let Wei Feng go. There was something strange about this.</p><p>Feng Yujin didn’t explain. His expression was solemn as he took out the God -Slaying Token that was half the height of a person.</p><p>The three of them saw that the God-Slaying Token bowed slightly in the direction of the tunnel and vibrated non-stop.</p><p>The frequency of its vibration was extremely obvious. It was many times higher than before.</p><p>“The power of guidance!”</p><p>Feng Yujin looked back at the interior of the Ran Ming ruins in shock. He glanced a few more times at the gap that Wei Feng had made with his sword and the giant mural that had been destroyed..</p><p>“This power is very strong, very strong… Hey, you’re not a Holy Emperor!”</p><p>Feng Yujin looked annoyed as he spoke. It was obvious that he wanted to explain but was afraid of wasting time.</p><p>He didn’t say much about the power of guidance. He just grabbed the God -Slaying Token that seemed about to fly into the Ran Ming ruins and stared at Xu Xiaoshou. “Retreat immediately!”</p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p>Outside the Black Water Stream, a loud noise could be heard.</p><p>A battle seemed to have broken out in the outside world. Demi-saints fighting in the Four Symbols Secret Realm? The sound was so loud that it traveled through the Black Water Stream and could be heard at this place?</p><p>Feng Yujin’s attitude suddenly changed…</p><p>The Saint war that had suddenly erupted in the outside world…</p><p>It gave Jin Ren a bad feeling.</p><p>However, he glanced at Wei Feng. This person had not been dealt with yet. How could they retreat?</p><p>Jin Ren had received the command from his original body and any thought of life and death had been set aside.</p><p>He didn’t promptly self-destruct because he was worried that MO Mo’s restrictions would prevent Feng Yujin from defeating Wei Feng.</p><p>But now…</p><p>“You retreat, I will stay!”</p><p>Jin Ren made an instant decision.</p><p>No matter what reason Feng Yujin had to ‘retreat’, he believed in the Holy Emperor’s judgment. This was respect for his strength.</p><p>Feng Yujin shook his head and shouted.</p><p>“Let’s go together, that includes you!”</p><p>The last sentence was aimed at the God of Killing Wei Feng.</p><p>Wei Feng only felt a sense of doubt and almost followed him.</p><p>But soon, he was baffled.</p><p>What the hell was this!</p><p>His mission was to guard the entrance to the Ran Ming ruins. Why did this Holy Emperor Fengtian suddenly want to run?</p><p>Was this his fighting style?</p><p>He wanted to say, “You want to run? Not a single one of you will be able to escape”. However, Wei Feng knew that this Holy Emperor’s power wasn’t something he could contend with on his own.</p><p>He quickly sent out a ‘request for backup’ signal in the Heavenly Group’s combat channel, but there was no reply.</p><p>He looked at the nervous and confused duo in front of him and hesitated for a moment. He said in an uncertain tone.</p><p>“Then, are you guys leaving?”</p><p>Before the mission, Dao Qiongcang did not mention that his opponent would be a Holy Emperor. He only said that he could defend the entrance of the tunnel.</p><p>Out of absolute trust, Wei Feng thought that it was part of Dao Qiongcang’s prediction when he encountered the Holy Emperor Fengtian.</p><p>The Holy Emperor Fengtian must have some restrictions that prevented him from fighting demi-saints. Being in a woman’s body was the best proof.</p><p>Hence, without even a second thought, Wei Feng charged forward. In the end, he was subdued in one move.</p><p>Therefore, there was only one thought in his mind:</p><p>Dao Qiongcang asked me to guard this place and not let anyone in. He didn’t ask me to stop Xu Xiaoshou and the others from leaving, right?</p><p>Scaring people away seemed to be one of the methods to protect the tunnel entrance?</p><p>When Feng Yujin heard that, he let out a long sigh of relief and smiled and his posture became extremely relaxed.</p><p>Wei Feng’s scalp went numb, and he raised his saber in anticipation.</p><p>“Six Paths, Celestial Dragon Seal!”</p><p>Feng Yujin really attacked.</p><p>A Holy Emperor really chose to ambush a demi-saint with a covert attack.</p><p>With a swish, he bypassed the Yama’s Banquet and flashed behind Wei Feng.</p><p>However, Wei Feng’s battle consciousness was too strong. He twisted the Yama’s Banquet in his hand and struck out at the back of his head.</p><p>Feng Yujin was extremely fast.</p><p>His palm was originally aimed at the back of Wei Feng’s head, but he did not expect that he could predict his move.</p><p>Thus, he adapted to the situation and changed tactics. He turned into a gray mist like a snake and passed through Wei Feng’s crotch. Then, he struck Wei Feng’s abdomen with his palm.</p><p>The gray sealing mist turned into a sky-covering dragon and charged into Wei Feng’s energy reserve.</p><p>“Disgraceful…”</p><p>Wei Feng found it difficult to speak.</p><p>He only felt his vision darken, he could not hear anything and his sense of touch was sealed…</p><p>His six senses were all gone.</p><p>Even his soul and mind felt like they were placed into a pool of stagnant water that was deadly still with no ripples.</p><p>He had calculated numerous times and never thought that he would guess his fate so correctly!</p><p>The Holy Emperor Fengtian actually chose to use a trick. The Holy Emperor against a demi-saint. He actually cast aside his dignity and chose to launch a sneak attack!</p><p>This time, Wei Feng was careless and did not dodge..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
