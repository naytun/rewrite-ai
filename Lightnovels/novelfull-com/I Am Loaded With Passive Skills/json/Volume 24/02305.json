Instead, he checked his inventory.</p><p>Passive value: 1562558.</p><p>He didn’t have much left. He only had enough points left to upgrade three skills.</p><p>“Lucky Draw, Profound Dao Seed, Evolution Water?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated for a moment. He realized that after these three skills had their second awakening, he could actually push them back.</p><p>No matter how strong they were, they couldn’t be stronger after the second awakening.</p><p>Instead of adding icing on the cake, it was better to level up the passive skills!</p><p>Without any hesitation, Xu Xiaoshou made a choice that was not based on impulse.</p><p>Passive value: 1562558. Passive Points: 62558.</p><p>“Recoil…”</p><p>“Recoil Holy Emperor Lv.0.”</p><p>“Sharpness…” “Sharpness Holy Emperor Lv.0.” “Toughness…”</p><p>“Toughness Holy Emperor Lv.0.” He frantically added points.</p><p>His physical strength soared crazily.</p><p>Three consecutive sounds of the saint’s calamity thunder echoed through the void as if celebrating the success of Xu Xiaoshou’s experiment and encouraging his physical breakthrough.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit could no longer maintain its calm.</p><p>It already knew that every time the thunder sounded, it meant that this human kid had a major breakthrough.</p><p>However, it seemed that he was still in the same state as before the Apricot Realm’s evolution.</p><p>This was truly terrifying.</p><p>The universe contained within was just the tip of the iceberg!</p><p>Just how many hidden trump cards did this kid have?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not hesitate to level up this time. He chose the Extended Passive Skill purely because of his obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p><p>If all three skills received the Extended Passive Skill, his Fundamental Passive Skill, and Extended Passive Skill would all be at Holy Emperor Lv.o. The interface was excellent.</p><p>As for the rest, there were still two skills that he hadn’t clicked on: Cooking Expert and Drawing Expertise.</p><p>These two were actually stronger, and their effects were even more bizarre and wonderful.</p><p>But this time, there were two failures instead of three. It didn’t look good on the interface, that was all.</p><p>“One million Passive Points. It’s not much. I can basically accumulate it in one battle.”</p><p>“As for the proficient passive skill, I can also choose it during the battle. It’s at the same level as the Weaving Expertise that I found before and realized that I needed it halfway through the battle.”</p><p>“I’ll use the Extended Passive Skill first. It’s always safer. At least the physical body can bring more protection rather than just an illusion of spiritual insight.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou concluded it and tested the newly upgraded Extended Passive Skill.</p><p>The Recoil was very strong. Now, he could really realize the illusion he had when he drew on this skill. He could shake mountains and rivers with a flick of his finger and breakthrough space in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The Toughness was not bad. Xu Xiaoshou did not try it out, but when it was used with the Recoil, he felt like he did not need to make any moves. No one in the world could make him move except for The Divine.</p><p>The effect of the Sharpness was extremely exaggerated. Due to the influence of the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy, it would no longer hurt the people around it.</p><p>However, as long as the sharp edges were exposed, Xu Xiaoshou realized that even his hair was sharper than Hidden Bitter!</p><p>In response to this, Hidden Bitter let out a cry and expressed its grievance.</p><p>“It’s really time to find a master to fix you up…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wanted to laugh, but he couldn’t because he didn’t know who in the world could help Hidden Bitter.</p><p>Perhaps he could only ask Bazhun’an later.</p><p>He weighed the spatial ring in his hand. It was filled with Dragon Apricot fruits. Xu Xiaoshou sat cross-legged and quickly entered the next stage of cultivation.</p><p>One, two, three…</p><p>When he activated the Breathing Technique, it was no longer difficult for him to absorb the medicinal effects of the Dragon Apricot fruits.</p><p>However, that pleasurable feeling was only a little weaker than before. Hence, Xu Xiaoshou began to roll around on the ground again.</p><p>“Awesome!”</p><p>“Oh, oh, oh…”</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou was determined not to wait any longer. Therefore, even though he felt so good that he was about to explode, he continued to gorge on the Dragon Apricot fruits.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit was used to the sight of its owner rolling around happily on the ground.</p><p>When the Dragon Apricot Spirit saw this scene, it actually did not feel much of a surprise.</p><p>It realized that it was somewhat impressed!</p><p>Now, no matter what this human kid did, there seemed to be a deeper meaning behind his actions.</p><p>The sun gradually sank, and night came.</p><p>The Apricot Realm entered the first cycle of Yin and Yang, the cycle of day and night.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou had consumed all the 99 Dragon Apricot fruits and had digested all of the power.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>When a loud and clear dragon’s roar emerged from his throat like thunder, a brand new aura of the power of the ancestral source appeared on his body.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit, who waited in the mid-stage of the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer for a long time, had a hint of satisfaction in its eyes.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had transformed again!</p><p>There were only faint dragon patterns on his body when he swallowed the first Dragon Apricot fruit, but now, he could completely conjure up a set of dragon scales armor-scarlet-gold dragon scales armor!</p><p>As he roared, a pair of dragon horns grew out of his head and revealed its majestic appearance. The power in his body gathered crazily, and the particles in his chest collapsed and condensed into a scarlet-gold Dragon Pearl.</p><p>“Judgement of the Demonic Emperor! ”</p><p>The name of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s second skill flashed through Xu Xiaoshou’s mind. That move could shatter the power of a Dragon Pearl and launch a world-destruction attack.</p><p>Now, he had also formed a Dragon Pearl, the foundation of this power.</p><p>Although it looked very small at the moment, it was only the size of a ‘dragon’s eye’, the fruit, not an actual dragon’s eye, and could not be compared to the precious dragon at all.</p><p>“However, the Dragon Pearl is very powerful. It can gather all my strength in an instant, accumulate it, and then I can decide whether to release it.”</p><p>“In this case, I can absorb other people’s energy by using the Breathing and</p><p>Transformation Technique and keep them hidden within the Dragon Pearl..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
