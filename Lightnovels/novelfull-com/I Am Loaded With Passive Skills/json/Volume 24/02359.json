Cutting wood is cutting me.”</p><p>“A hundred years of cutting wood, how can life and death affect me?”</p><p>An ethereal voice echoed in all directions.</p><p>With a boom, a towering ancient tree appeared on Cen Qiaofu’s neck where his head should have been.</p><p>Lush tree roots shot out from under his feet. Some pierced into the Great Path, while others penetrated the ground as they crazily absorbed the nutrients.</p><p>As the ground cracked, old trees started to appear, one after another.</p><p>In just a few breaths of time, the wilderness and sparse forest within a few miles had turned into a lush primitive forest.</p><p>Wang Dachui was terrified.</p><p>He had forgotten that even if he did not dare to use his spiritual source, Cen Qiaofu had transcended the tribulation, so he didn’t have this restriction!</p><p>In the end, this person looked like a crazy butcher after he picked up the axe, but he was only using the power of the Pan Xian Ax.</p><p>In actual fact, he was purely a Spiritual Cultivator.</p><p>When he became a Cutting Path overnight, it proved that his comprehension of the Path Principles was too high.</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>The lightning from the saint calamity poured down and bombarded the primitive forest.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s form disappeared.</p><p>In the next second, numerous incarnations of Cen Qiaofu appeared in the sky.</p><p>They landed on different ancient trees and hacked them down with axes.</p><p>“Pa, pa, pa…”</p><p>The primitive forest was instantly destroyed by Cen Qiaofu’s continuous axe strikes.</p><p>This scene was beyond one’s comprehension.</p><p>At least that was what Wang Dachui felt. He even found it funny.</p><p>Above his head, there was also an illusory Cen Qiaofu, who also slashed down with his axe and treated him like a tree.</p><p>However, the split power was too weak. Wang Dachui only needed to raise his hand to shatter the clone.</p><p>“What is Cen Qiaofu doing?”</p><p>“There doesn’t seem to be any mention about him in the intelligence report?” Wang Dachui didn’t dare to laugh. He quickly felt that something was amiss.</p><p>The Old Woodcutter’s talent was too outstanding!</p><p>In the past, this person had always hidden his true strength and even lowered his cultivation level to the Cutting Path Stage. He had never shown others his true strength.</p><p>Perhaps there was a deeper meaning behind this absurd act?</p><p>Before he even had time to think, the thousands of Cen Qiaofu finished cutting down the ancient trees and merged into one body.</p><p>The blade of the Pan Xian Ax in his hand lit up with an intense light.</p><p>“Slash to the extreme, the Dao will return to one!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu raised his axe, but before it even made contact, the saint calamity that dropped from the Nine Heavens was cut apart by the sharp blade of the axe and scattered in all directions.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s axe slashed down and caused the Path Principles of Heaven and Earth to shatter. The axe locked onto Wang Dachui, who stood right in front of him.</p><p>It was also at this moment that Wang Dachui realized something:</p><p>Earlier, the Old Woodcutter’s thousands of incarnations who chopped away were not just there for show.</p><p>He had actually gathered all the true meaning of the word ‘slash’ back then and combined it into this attack.</p><p>The Dao that he had comprehended in the deep mountains and forests of the</p><p>Southern Region was not only the Dao of the mortal world, but also the Dao of ‘Slash’ that could break all laws!</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>When the Pan Xian Ax slashed down, Wang Dachui sighed in his heart.</p><p>He still came…</p><p>The withered yellow leaf that he saw at the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe gathering that day… he did not expect that it would fall on him in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Then come! Who’s afraid of who!”</p><p>A cornered dog would jump over a wall, and a furious rabbit would counterattack.</p><p>The spiritual source in Wang Dachui’s body was about to erupt. He couldn’t care less about the saint calamity locking down on him and could only focus on the present.</p><p>But at the same time, a shout came from afar.</p><p>“Senior Dachui, retreat first!”</p><p>A tall and sturdy figure broke through the air and slammed into the battlefield. He then sent Wang Dachui flying with a hefty kick, without any explanation.</p><p>Combat Division Chief, Fangfang!</p><p>The Cang God Armor on Fangfang’s body lit up with a complicated black-red patterned light. His body was wrapped in a strong spiritual source fluctuation.</p><p>He had already disregarded life and death!</p><p>He held his axes with both hands. After he kicked Wang Dachui away, he swung his axes upward.</p><p>“Overlord Splits the Mountain!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The three axes met in mid-air, and the space around them exploded. The air currents expanded and surged like a tide.</p><p>The Pan Xian Ax embodied the true intent of the word ‘slash’. As the axe slashed down, the Cang God Armor on Fangfang’s body cracked.</p><p>His two axes only lasted for half a aura before they shattered.</p><p>The Pan Xian Axe slashed at Fangfang’s left shoulder, and the black and red lights of the Cang God Armor instantly dimmed.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>A line of blood appeared in the air.</p><p>The Cang God Armor fell apart, and Fangfang was split into two.</p><p>His cries of agony echoed through the Nine Heavens. Fangfang’s face crumpled as he barely managed to save half of his body and head.</p><p>He was one person who was most afraid of pain. During the Combat Division training, he never uttered a sound.</p><p>He was one person who was most afraid of death, but for some reason, when he saw that Senior Dachui was about to die, he rushed forward as his blood boiled with rage.</p><p>Fangfang regretted his action.</p><p>He swore that if he could turn back time, he would never have rushed forward again!</p><p>Senior Dachui was clearly so annoying and he never had anything good to say. He always mocked him with cold and cutting remarks.</p><p>Fangfang could tell that Senior Dachui judged a book by its cover. He disliked him and looked down on his appearance. He even despised his beard.</p><p>“Why was I so foolish…”</p><p>Blood spewed from half of his body and he used his spiritual source to stop the flow and heal his injuries. However, Fangfang’s entire body was exhausted and he was filled with despair.</p><p>He knew.</p><p>There was no chance.</p><p>He had used his spiritual source.</p><p>No matter how many trump cards he had, he wouldn’t be able to withstand Cen Qiaofu’s saint calamity.</p><p>As expected, when the Nine Heavens calamity cloud sensed that there was a Spiritual Cultivator who helped to transcend the tribulation, it began to expand.</p><p>The saint calamity now locked onto the new Combat Division Chief, the sixteen-year-old higher void super genius, Fangfang!</p><p>“That’s good. At least Senior Dachui can escape. My sacrifice…” He cried out. “It was of some use.</p><p>Wang Dachui’s mind went blank after he was sent flying by the kick.</p><p>Having lived until now, he had long lost his youthful passion, and he no longer had the inclination deep within him to sacrifice himself for the sake of others.</p><p>He would do as much as he could.</p><p>He would live as long as he could.</p><p>He had never thought that one day, he would be saved by a young man in exchange for his life!</p><p>“Looks like I’m destined to be the bad guy today.” Cen Qiaofu looked down from the sky with his axe. When he saw this scene, his voice was filled with emotion.</p><p>He felt a slight admiration for Fangfang.</p><p>After all, he was famous at such a young age and had a promising future.</p><p>So even if they were on the opposite side, Cen Qiaofu didn’t really want to kill him.</p><p>To bully the weak required at most one strike. This was a necessary attack required by both sides.</p><p>Fangfang was able to block this fatal blow with the Cang God Armor. If this battle continued, Cen Qiaofu would feel ashamed.</p><p>Thus, he focused on Wang Dachui, who had no future.</p><p>Unexpectedly, in the end, Fangfang sacrificed his life and made an unexpected and lamentable choice…</p><p>It didn’t matter!</p><p>There was bound to be bloodshed during the Struggle for the Great Path.</p><p>Pity for the enemy would only put him in danger.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu no longer paid attention to Fangfang, who was left with only half a body and was locked on by the saint calamity.</p><p>This young man basically couldn’t survive.</p><p>He looked at Wang Dachui, who had been kicked far away.</p><p>Wang Dachui was stunned that he could still escape and had already retracted his spiritual source aura.</p><p>After he came to, he was caught in a dilemma.</p><p>Should he return to support?</p><p>Even if he returned, he wouldn’t be able to defeat Cen Qiaofu. There would only be one more life lost!</p><p>Turn around and leave?</p><p>A young man was willing to give up his life for a bag of old bones like him. How would he face the future if he did that?</p><p>“Ahhh!”</p><p>Wang Dachui held his thorny hammer and roared in pain.</p><p>He tapped on the battle channel.</p><p>“Fangfang has fallen. Requesting backup!”</p><p>After he did that, Wang Dachui fled and did not even turn back to look.</p><p>In fact, outside the area affected by the saint calamity, a large group of red and white clothed people had already gathered.</p><p>However, Cen Qiaofu had already risked his life in order to survive.</p><p>No matter how many people entered the battlefield, it would be useless if they could not escape from the saint calamity.</p><p>In fact, Fangfang had seen it and was well aware of it.</p><p>He could also understand why Wang Dachui had deserted him and fled for his life.</p><p>At his age, he already knew what was right and what was wrong.</p><p>However, at his age, he was still a teenager who had yet to reach adulthood. He was only sixteen.</p><p>Not all the young Chiefs of the six divisions were like Yu Lingdi, who had a heart of stone. He was willing to die and was not afraid of pain.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>When the saint calamity descended, the new Combat Division Chief Fangfang, cried so hard that his face was covered in snot.</p><p>He closed his eyes ad half of his body trembled uncontrollably, but he could still mumble.</p><p>“Senior Dachui, you made the right choice….”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
