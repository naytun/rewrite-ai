Either that sickly young master had kept his strength hidden or it was the person behind him.</p><p>Hua Ying shifted the alchemy cauldron behind her and moved to the side.</p><p>She stretched her hand out to stop the protectors in the air from making an appearance. After all, this was not a huge mess. It was just an insignificant person who wanted to ruin the Holy Palace Trial.</p><p>This matter should be easily resolved.</p><p>If you don’t have a good reason for your question, I’ll refine you into a meat Elixir later… “What’s your question?” Hua Ying asked kindly as she suppressed her anger.</p><p>“+(ln Awe, Passive Points+) +6514.” “+(Respected, Passive Points+)+2264.”</p><p>“+(Detested, Passive Points+) +7125.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that the person who was sent flying by Jin Ren was not at the Innate Stage, but a demi-saint expert.</p><p>He fanned himself slowly and said.</p><p>“Saint’s Envoy Hua Ying, it’s rumored that the Ran Ming ruins in the Four Symbols Secret Realm will appear soon.”</p><p>“The Holy Palace turned a blind eye to this and still set the trial location there.</p><p>That place is no less dangerous than the Sky City in the Eastern Region!”</p><p>“Dare I ask, isn’t this treating the lives and deaths of the trial-takers as child’s play? After all, we are only at the Innate Stage.”</p><p>As soon as he said this, the crowd broke into an uproar.</p><p>It was unknown when and where the legend of the Ran Ming ruins had spread, but everyone had heard of it.</p><p>She had thought that it was a secret that only high-level people had access to. After all, it involved the power of the ancestral source.</p><p>She didn’t think that someone would use this to directly question the Holy Palace envoy who organized the trial in the Golden Phoenix Square.</p><p>Hua Ying really had not expected someone to use this to cause trouble. She immediately sneered and replied.</p><p>“The Holy Palace has its own thoughts. The Holy Palace Trial have their own rules.”</p><p>“Since the trial had been arranged in the Four Symbols Secret Realm, you don’t have to worry about the safety of the trial-takers.”</p><p>She rested her elbows on the alchemy cauldron that was taller than a person, and her lips were pursed in disdain. She stared at the sickly young master as if she saw a human-shaped meatball-although it had not been refined yet.</p><p>D*mn you brat, when the announcement is over, your life will come to an end too! Hua Yin thought bitterly.</p><p>Some of the elderly protectors hidden in the dark could not help but sigh when they saw this. They thought to themselves that the young man was still too young and had fallen into a thief’s trap.</p><p>There was a huge discrepancy in the words uttered by this person who caused trouble!</p><p>My good Martial Nephew, you’re so gullible…The sickly young master laughed when he heard that. He covered his face with a paper fan and said in surprise. “In that case, it is true that the Ran Ming ruins have been discovered?!”</p><p>He said this final statement and defined that this was an established fact.</p><p>That was not all. He then changed the topic and continued to nitpick. “Does the Holy Palace really have the ability to protect the trial-takers?”</p><p>“It won’t be like the last time, right? The Eastern Region was just a border crossing for Saints and all the trial officers died?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already gotten all the information he had missed in the Yunlun Mountain Range on Abyss Island from his chat with Old Man Li.</p><p>The entire Golden Phoenix Square fell silent.</p><p>The high-level elites of the various large factions felt that a storm of blood was about to descend.</p><p>The Holy Palace envoy had actually confirmed the authenticity and location of the Ran Ming ruins in front of everyone!</p><p>And this Xu Gusheng chap…</p><p>It could only be said that he was truly audacious!</p><p>He dared to ask anything and even struck the deepest sore spot of the Eastern Region’s Imperial City Trial!</p><p>The geniuses who were about to participate in the trial didn’t feel anything. They only wanted to kill anyone who stood in their way.</p><p>The high-level elites of the various major factions now hoped that this Xu Gusheng could survive a little longer.</p><p>His mouth was really good!</p><p>He could ask the kind of questions that the elites wanted to ask but did not dare to ask!</p><p>+(Feared, Passive Points+) +8511.” +(Received Concern, Passive Points+)+4836.” +(Cursed, Passive Points+)+l.”</p><p>Hua Ying realized that she had been tricked.</p><p>But it was too late!</p><p>She almost opened the lid of the alchemy cauldron in front of everyone on the high platform to let the people inside out. Then, she would put that d*mned Xu Gusheng inside and sprinkle some seasoning on him to get rid of his fishy smell!</p><p>She gritted her teeth and said, “The deaths of the trial officers at the</p><p>Dongtianwang City were our greatest regret. However, the trial takers there did not suffer. Most of them survived.’</p><p>“Then there were still a small number of people who unfortunately died? Their lives were cheap… Oh, I’m sorry, I said the wrong thing. That’s their fate, right?” The sickly Young Master’s paper fan still waved at the same frequency, but the square was filled with gasps.</p><p>Yingying and Qiao’er’s legs went weak, and they almost fainted.</p><p>Stop it…</p><p>This is not a joke, Young Master Xu! Please, please…</p><p>They each grabbed the corners of Young Master Xu’s clothes, but Young Master Xu did not even turn his head and slapped their hands away with the paper fan.</p><p>+(Cursed, Passive Points +)+2.”</p><p>“You brat…”</p><p>Hua Ying’s chest heaved violently and her eyes gradually turned red. “Are you here to cause trouble?”</p><p>Suddenly, a certain string in her mind snapped without any warning.</p><p>“Do you think I will allow you to create problems here!”</p><p>“I’ll make you crawl!”</p><p>She bent down and picked up the alchemy cauldron with one hand. Under the stunned gazes of everyone in the square and even the protectors of the Holy Palace, she flew out from her location.</p><p>She actually wanted to act first and report it later. She wanted to smash this person’s head into a meat pie with lightning speed before she did anything else..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
