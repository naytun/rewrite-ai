If you have the guts, come after me!”</p><p>Jin Ren swiftly retreated, passing the seemingly invisible MO MO, who had been watching the spectacle with zero presence and dashed away from the ruins of Ran Ming.</p><p>“Damn!”</p><p>Wei Feng went mad, brandishing his sword in a wild pursuit.</p><p>MO MO watched as the two approached the exit of the Ran Ming ruins, completely ignoring her, and leaving her utterly puzzled.</p><p>It seemed that the “Holy Emperor,” should be the protagonist of this battle.</p><p>Jin Ren remained vigilant throughout.</p><p>He was merely testing, and to his surprise, Wei Feng completely disregarded MO MO, the trump card, and relentlessly pursued him.</p><p>He instantly confirmed that this wasn’t something Wei Feng could fake. Even if he were to explore the content of the jade scroll, he wouldn’t be killed by some mysterious trick.</p><p>Even if he did die, it would only be his second true body—this thought originated from Xu Xiaoshou’s main body.</p><p>At the same time, it was evident that the jade scroll held great importance for Wei Feng, possibly more than Feng Yujin entering the Ran Ming ruins or even more than his own life.</p><p>“Stop chasing after me, this isn’t a gem. I just want to take a look.”</p><p>Jin Ren’s speed was incredibly fast.</p><p>He took the easy way out, effortlessly bypassing the Spell Forbidden Barrier. Moving through the giant ruins, he pressed the jade scroll against his forehead.</p><p>“Ah, don’t look!”</p><p>With blazing red eyes, Wei Feng found himself unable to catch up.</p><p>Shocked by Xu Xiaoshou’s ability to manipulate spatial attributes within the Spell Forbidden Barrier, he paused in his pursuit with his blade raised.</p><p>“Domineering Blade Style…”</p><p>With that, the atmosphere changed dramatically.</p><p>The ruins trembled, space cracked, and Path Principles were revealed, surging like turbulent water, only to fracture instantly.</p><p>Wei Feng bit the tip of his tongue and spat out a mouthful of blood onto the Yama’s Banquet held aloft.</p><p>The broad dark cyan blade gleamed with a hint of red.</p><p>“Locked-on, Passive Points +1.” “Imprisoned, Passive Points +1.” “Threatened, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Unleashing the ultimate move now?”</p><p>Jin Ren found it difficult to move, as if caught in a quagmire.</p><p>The lethal stare from Wei Feng, the God of Killing, was potent enough to imprison him in place, held captive by an overwhelming force of death. It created a spatial exile, rendering him unable to escape.</p><p>How could he remain oblivious to the overpowering aura of this blade? Confronting it meant either death or inevitable maiming.</p><p>Jin Ren wasn’t afraid. Instead, he just grinned and teasingly winked at Wei Feng, who was raising his blade from a distance: “Vanishing Technique.”</p><p>—Independence!</p><p>“Immortal Slay!”</p><p>As Wei Feng swung his blade, he realized he had forgotten his target, but the blade had already been unleashed.</p><p>Drenched in a bloody glow, the blade cleaved through space and the Great Path, piercing the Ran Ming ruins. It broke through the delicate membrane enveloping the Black Water Stream outside, racing past Beibei and prompting the young girl to hurriedly step back.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Above the perennial black mist over the Black Water Stream, a cliff suddenly exploded with a deafening sound. Mist rolled and dispersed to the sides.</p><p>The white- and red-clothed people stationed on the cliff looked up in astonishment.</p><p>A blood-red blade light flew from below, tearing through space and the Great Path, disappearing into the sky.</p><p>Its ferocity, its brutality, its intensity…</p><p>The residual impact even swept away the remaining half of the hill, pulverizing the cliff into powder.</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>The red- and white-clothed people formed an array, with Cheng Huan at the forefront. Curiously, he poked his head out just as the force of the blade struck him, causing him to spit out blood on the spot.</p><p>Startled, he quickly returned to his position, roaring, “Form the array!”</p><p>The light of the spiritual array shone.</p><p>The “Hundred Stars Pure Qi Array, ” meticulously crafted by Dao Qiongcang and created by dozens of higher void beings along with hundreds of Cutting Path Stage cultivators, had successfully shielded against the explosive force unleashed by Xu Xiaoshou’s Great Array of Stars. However, it did not face another onslauzht.</p><p>The blade light cut through the Four Symbols Secret Realm and disappeared, leaving only shock in its wake.</p><p>“God of Killing, Wei Feng!”</p><p>“Senior Wei Feng has made a move, no doubt!”</p><p>“That blade is too terrifying, coming from the Black Water Stream, cutting through the Four Symbols Secret Realm… Xu Xiaoshou, how did he put so much pressure on the Emperor, Wei Feng, in such a short time?”</p><p>Ran Ming ruins, at the entrance of the passage.</p><p>“Collection of Excuses?”</p><p>A voice, tinged with three parts eccentricity, three parts astonishment, and four parts shock, reached the ears of MO MO, the Little Frost Ferret cradled in</p><p>MO Mo’s hands, Feng Yujin sealed within MO Mo’s body, and the God of Killing, Wei Feng, who captured MO Mo’s perplexed gaze.</p><p>This voice proved that Xu Xiaoshou was not dead.</p><p>The previous strike was indeed powerful, but it missed Jin Ren, who invoked Independence. The blade deviated.</p><p>Upon hearing the voice, the face of the old man in black, Wei Feng, visibly reddened, with smoke even rising from his ears.</p><p>“No!!!”</p><p>He yelled in terror, as if foreseeing some great horror. He turned around with his blade raised, ready to strike again.</p><p>However, in the same instant, Wei Feng lost track of Xu Xiaoshou’s position in his disappearing state.</p><p>Instinctively, he tried to lock onto the only opponent with his Blade Will, but the mysterious spiritual technique displayed by Xu Xiaoshou at this moment seemed entirely new.</p><p>There was no record of it in the intelligence!</p><p>“The first…</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Wei Feng’s eyes were red and bloodshot, veins pulsing with madness as he swung his sword wildly in all directions.</p><p>The blade light had no fixed target, slashing in all directions.</p><p>MO MO dodged left and right, unable to comprehend why the mighty Emperor was losing control like this due to something called “Collection of Excuses.”</p><p>If it was a spiritual technique, it was inconsequential.</p><p>If it was intelligence, so be it.</p><p>Only when she heard giggles coming from nowhere—the teasing voice of Xu Xiaoshou—did it become clear.</p><p>“Oh my, it’s really a collection of defeat quotes, the ‘Collection of Excuses,’ huh?”</p><p>“The first, Hallmaster Dao, I was wrong, but that’s because the killing intent of Yama’s Banquet affected me, and I lost control. I am guilty, I confess… Oh my,</p><p>‘I am guilty, I confess,’ hahaha…”</p><p>MO Mo’s hand holding the little bronze cauldron trembled slightly. With a slightly widened gaze, she stared incredulously at the God of Killing, Wei Feng.</p><p>Wei Feng’s lips trembled, feeling as if he had been completely drained of energy.</p><p>He even had to thrust the blade into the ground to support himself, preventing himself from collapsing.</p><p>“The second, Hallmaster Dao, I was wrong, hehe… cough cough, I shouldn’t have pursued Xu Xiaoshou too deeply, allowing his companions to enter the Ran Ming ruins. Guarding the entrance should have been my mission. I am guilty, I confess… Ahaha, this was written by Dao Qiongcang for you?”</p><p>Thud!</p><p>Little Frost Ferret, after hearing it, was petrified and accidentally fell to the ground.</p><p>It let out a shocked squeal, gazing at the fallen Wei Feng. Its little claws, in a display of embarrassment, succumbed to their habitual awkwardness, tightly scraping the ground. Eventually, it decided to burrow into the earth, not daring to show its face, afraid of becoming the target for someone to vent their frustrations.</p><p>MO MO, too, stood there in stunned silence. A sound resembling a gasp escaped her throat, “Hiss…”</p><p>Feng Yujin suddenly realized something.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou was on their team…</p><p>Damn, this guy was truly extraordinary!</p><p>Wei Feng’s hand slid off the blade hilt, his body went limp, and he collapsed as if he had peacefully passed away after days of exhaustion.</p><p>He still couldn’t lock onto his target…</p><p>“The third, Hallmaster Dao, I was wrong, but that’s because Xu Xiaoshou is too cunning. He can even transform into Beibei. I was chasing only a decoy; his true body was hidden. But regardless, I am guilty, I confess… Damn, I can’t hold it in anymore. Elder Dao the Flamboyant really thought it through. Wow</p><p>hahaha…”</p><p>“The fourth, Hallmaster Dao, I was wrong, haha, but Xu Xiaoshou transformed into Yue Gongli. How do I defend against that? But no matter… I’ll be damned!</p><p>Even Yue Gongli, hahaha…”</p><p>“The fifth…</p><p>“The sixth….”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
