It was more than 108,000 miles away from the Jade Capital City.</p><p>In this world, in this lifetime, for the poor, a journey is hard to complete.</p><p>If an ordinary person wanted to travel between the two realms, they would have to use the Inter-realm teleportation portal.</p><p>For example, 99% of the people in the Eastern Region only knew about the Eastern Sky Realm in their entire lives, and they might never be able to leave Dongtianwang City.</p><p>The Qilin Realm was also vast.</p><p>It was closer to the four-hill mountains.</p><p>Other than Cutting Paths and higher voids, should ordinary people want to travel across realms, they would have to follow the rules and go to the teleportation portal.</p><p>Gong Yang Mountain was sleeping in the center of the Qilin Realm.</p><p>When you looked down from above, the terrain of this mountain resembled a full moon-shaped bow, facing the south. Meanwhile, the east-to-west resembled a crouching dragon’s head, leaving a gap in the south.</p><p>The gap looked like a bloody mouth that was trying its best to swallow the entire south of the mountain. That only gap in the south was also the entrance to the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>When the spatial passageway opened, it would emit a bright light. From afar, it looked like two dragons playing with a pearl.</p><p>If someone came to the entrance of the Four Symbols Secret Realm in the south and stood there, they would be able to see the two most famous peaks of Gong Yang Mountain.</p><p>The “Antelope Peak” and “Horn Peak”!</p><p>On the average line of the mountain range, the two peaks protruded out and curved into the sky. It was so steep that the tip of the peak caved into the north, forming a natural cliff abyss.</p><p>From a giant’s perspective, these two resembled two huge goat horns.</p><p>The creation of the peaks was both mysterious and marvelous.</p><p>The mountain itself wasn’t ominous, it was its reputation that bred fear.</p><p>Hence the name, Gong Yang Mountain came to be.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou teleported over with Elder Han and MO MO, he was also shocked by the majestic mountain.</p><p>When he lowered his head, he seemed to see Dao Qiongcang pulling the Evil Sin Bow that he had snatched from below and aiming it at him.</p><p>Through his Perception, he could see the sharp tips of the steep Antelope Peak and Horn Peak, which were just enough to hang the corpse of a Berserk Giant.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his eyes, and the illusions disappeared.</p><p>“F*ck, I was too sensitive…”</p><p>Looking to the south, the entrance to the Four Symbols Secret Realm had already been opened, and there were guardians of major factions waiting around.</p><p>However, the younger cultivators could not be seen. Clearly, they had entered first.</p><p>“A time difference of an hour…”</p><p>“These people are really going all out to enter the Holy Palace.”</p><p>Although it took some time for Xu Xiaoshou to go back to find people.</p><p>However, to be able to travel faster than spatial teleportation, could only mean that these people had probably heard the news long ago and did not listen to the lecture at all. They had been guarding the entrance of the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>Once the secret realm opened, the cultivators were immediately sent in and were directly ahead of the starting line!</p><p>“The generosity of the Holy Palace is impressive…”</p><p>“Were they really not bothered by trifles, or did they forget to only open the secret realm when everyone is here?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the figures that were gradually flying over from below. He shook his head and laughed when he saw that GongYang Mountain was starting to get lively.</p><p>If he were a challenger, he would definitely be stuck at the entrance and argue with the Holy Palace about their so-called ‘fairness’, and then push the matter to the level of ‘butterfly effect’.</p><p>The Holy Palace’s lack of attention to detail could lead to a fallen genius. Then, after thirty years, he would turn to the evil side and come back to take revenge on the Holy Palace.</p><p>How could one not even understand such a simple logic?</p><p>“The aura of a demi-saint…” MO MO suddenly spoke, interrupting a certain someone’s wild thoughts.</p><p>She held a small bronze cauldron in her left hand, and the red sandalwood fragrance burned gently in it. Even her voice seemed to have a hint of fragrance, “There are many paths!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had “Stealth”, and MO MO had Feng Yujin’s Holy Emperor guidance and self-sealing. If the Frost Ferret wanted to escape, even a demi-saint would find it hard to detect it.</p><p>The three of them stood high in the sky, on the clouds. Their auras were faint, however, they had the aura of a big shot of the underground forces peering into the world.</p><p>The area below Gong Yang Mountain was extremely lively, and no one noticed them.</p><p>“Are there many demi-saints?” Xu Xiaoshou glanced over. “Can they sense you?”</p><p>“Impossible.” MO MO rarely said anything.</p><p>“Demi-saint can’t, but Holy Emperor can sense my existence…” The Little Frost Ferret peeked out of Xu Xiaoshou’s arms and carefully sized up MO Mo.</p><p>This person was both familiar and unfamiliar.</p><p>After all, she had gone to Xu Yue Grey Palace with it and stayed there for a month.</p><p>But what was with the voice on her body?</p><p>Lord Shou called her Feng Yujin?</p><p>Was it the big boss of the Black Vein?</p><p>Han trembled and did not dare to ask anything.</p><p>It realized that it really had the “younger brother” physique, whether it was on Abyss Island or the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>“Are there any Holy Emperors in the Four Symbols Secret Realm? Can you sense it?” Xu Xiaoshou looked at Junior Sister MO, whose cultivation had risen even faster than his own.</p><p>She had already reached the Cutting Path Stage, and she could break through to the higher void with one step.</p><p>It might have been broken, but the power of the sealed self could not even be seen through “Perception”.</p><p>MO MO lowered her gaze as if she was sensing something, or perhaps she was listening for an answer.</p><p>After a while, she reached out and caught the falling snowflakes.</p><p>“Holy Emporer came before.”</p><p>The Little Frost Ferret silently retracted its head back into Lord Shou’s arms.</p><p>The snowy days of Gong Yang Mountain were truly cold. Even the Frost Ferret felt a chill in its heart.</p><p>“Can you withstand it?” Xu Xiaoshou patted the foreign object in front of his chest and noticed that Elder Han was in a strange mood.</p><p>This guy was once locked in the Four Symbols Secret Realm, so it was normal for him to be afraid of this place.</p><p>MO MO tilted her head and said softly,</p><p>“Elder Han’s Legendary Beast Control Artifact was personally made by Palace</p><p>Master Bai Zhou. In addition to his bloodline talent, he’s also very talented..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
