They’re arriving in great numbers.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was momentarily stunned, then abruptly fixed his gaze on the God-Slaying Token half his height.</p><p>At the same time, Feng Yujin cursed under his breath, “You are indeed a jinx!”</p><p>Could Dao Qiongcang truly sense the whereabouts of the God-Slaying Token in MO MO’s hands through some means?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could find no other reason why Elder Dao the Flamboyant would be able to lock onto their positions.</p><p>He had arrived through spatial teleportation, along with stealth.</p><p>With a Holy Emperor and a fugitive Great Emperor by his side, how could they possibly be tracked by their aura?</p><p>Yet the people from the Holy Divine Palace still arrived so swiftly, indicating that they had not missed them due to the time difference of spatial teleportation…</p><p>“Once we enter the Four Symbols Secret Realm, our position will be exposed,” MO MO said tacitly, her voice carrying a hint of solemnity.</p><p>“Jump!” Xu Xiaoshou dared not delay any longer.</p><p>Into the Black Water Stream, into the Spell Forbidden Barrier.</p><p>Feng Yujin and himself were completely unrestrained in combat strength. In contrast, the Holy Divine Palace couldn’t employ the strategy of overwhelming numbers; at most, only one person could be a significant threat.</p><p>Favorable timing and terrain were all beneath the cliff!</p><p>The two, along with a beast, leaped into the Black Water Stream.</p><p>As long as they crossed a thousand feet and broke through the barrier of the Black Water, they would enter the ruins of Ran Ming.</p><p>Meanwhile…</p><p>“Hum!”</p><p>The cliff’s wall wriggled, forming a thick and solid platform below, blocking their descent.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou halted his movement just in time, hovering in mid-air.</p><p>MO MO reached out and flipped in mid-air, avoiding the embarrassment of landing on her head.</p><p>“Snap!”</p><p>However, Little Frost Ferret plunged into the rock layer, as if diving onto the ground. Half of its body was embedded into the rock, leaving only its hind legs and buttocks protruding and wriggling above the rock surface.</p><p>“Who!”</p><p>After pulling itself out of the rock, the ice-type demi-saint ghost beast was both embarrassed and infuriated.</p><p>It didn’t dare to look up at the two companions above, instead venting its anger loudly:</p><p>“Which cowardly rat dares to play such a trick on this lord!”</p><p>With a click, the thick solid rock that protruded from the cliff wall instantaneously froze into ice crystals.</p><p>Little Frost Ferret swatted down with one paw, and the rock shattered into ice debris.</p><p>“Lord Shou, let’s go down!”</p><p>Someone was clearly trying to stop them from jumping into the Black Water Stream, and even Elder Han had noticed. With a shout, he leaped downward once again.</p><p>“Snap!”</p><p>The cliff’s wall protruded again, and the Little Frost Ferret plunged into it, this time turning itself into a white ferret pancake.</p><p>MO MO held a small bronze cauldron, lips curled, but quickly suppressed her laughter, with only her shoulders trembling slightly.</p><p>Jin Ren couldn’t hold it in at all and burst into laughter with a “puff”.</p><p>They were teammates!</p><p>It was wrong to laugh like this!</p><p>But holding it in was not good either…</p><p>“Hahaha!” Feng Yujin burst into laughter, his voice a bit hoarse, “I remembered, you’re Little Han, right? The one from the Inner Island?”</p><p>He seemed to have finally recognized this Frost Ferret, which had been traveling with them for over a month. Where did that sense of familiarity come from?</p><p>Such embarrassment, aside from the pushover ghost beast ferret from Inner Island that he had met a few times years ago, who else could it be?</p><p>“Squeak!”</p><p>A high-pitched, piercing, unwilling, and mortified scream echoed between the cliffs.</p><p>With a furious bang, the Little Frost Ferret turned into a monstrous creature!</p><p>It transformed into a towering Frost Ferret, pure white, with ghostly energy condensing into wings on its back, giving it an eerie and evil appearance.</p><p>“Get lost!” Frost Ferret glared with its two eyes, and the ghost beast wings on its back swept forward.</p><p>Whoosh…</p><p>A chilling and icy air swept through the cliff, freezing the entire mountain in front of it into ice crystals.</p><p>“Shatter!”</p><p>Elder Han retracted his wings, and with a bang, the cliff below the Black Water Stream collapsed, ice crystal debris scattered in all directions.</p><p>MO MO watched in awe.</p><p>Little Frost Ferret was cute indeed.</p><p>But ultimately, it was still a demi-saint; just because it couldn’t find its target, it destroyed everything around it in anger.</p><p>The mountain wall had grown from the cliff.</p><p>Now that the cliff was gone, could it grow back?</p><p>“Lord Shou, come up quickly, I’ll take you down.”</p><p>The massive Frost Ferret turned its head, its eyes no longer showing any trace of anger, its tone becoming extremely gentle.</p><p>Jin Ren didn’t directly jump onto Frost Ferret’s back. Instead, he stared at the ice crystal fragments that had been shattered and fallen into Black Water Stream, furrowing his brows.</p><p>In theory, even if this was a person’s transformation, under the attack of a demi-saint, their vitality should have been extinguished.</p><p>Why did it feel like every piece of rock fragment in those shattered ice crystals still held a faint life force?</p><p>“Are you the Frost Ferret?”</p><p>A curious voice came from below the Black Water Stream.</p><p>Elder Han looked down and was surprised to see that the entire mountain, shattered into pieces by itself, had broken free from its icy encasement.</p><p>In mid-air, they reorganized and cast themselves into a youth with an imposing presence and a handsome face.</p><p>The youth’s eyes were fiery, with a hint of excitement hidden within. Clenching his fists tightly, he seemed to be anticipating a great battle.</p><p>“Frost Ferret, a demi-saint…”</p><p>“It may not have strong combat power, but that’s in terms of ordinary people.</p><p>He’s best at escape techniques…”</p><p>He recited one by one, and his gaze quickly passed over Frost Ferret, landing on the figure beside it, his eyes bursting with brilliance:</p><p>“You’re Xu Xiaoshou? Lord Shou of the Saint Servant?”</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao said that if Xu Xiaoshou were to come, he would surely be accompanied by a Frost Ferret. His prediction has come true.”</p><p>“But this person…”</p><p>The youth’s gaze shifted to the seemingly calm woman beside him, and he was briefly startled, “Who are you?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
