It once again felt incredulous.</p><p>Just now, this kid had clearly been drained of everything!</p><p>He didn’t have any vitality and vigor left in his body; it was as if he was an empty shell!</p><p>However, after he slept in the mountains for less than 15 minutes, this fellow woke up and was restored to his full condition in just 10 breaths?</p><p>“This is a human?” The Dragon Apricot was confused.</p><p>It had lived for so long, but this was the first time it had questioned the identity of a human species so many times in such a short period of time.</p><p>On the other side, Xu Xiaoshou, who fiddled about with the Ultimate Giant’s empty shell, had already measured its hardness.</p><p>“I’ve fallen back to Rank 3…”</p><p>Just now, he couldn’t even cut this thing with Hidden Bitter, but now he could!</p><p>After Xu Xiaoshou woke up, the first thing he did was to check his own condition.</p><p>Because of the various endurance passive skills, as long as he did not die, his status would always be zero and full marks.</p><p>Naturally, to continue to test the might of the Ultimate Giant was the top priority.</p><p>“The first time I struck it after I woke up, it was roughly as hard as a grade one spiritual weapon. Even Hidden Bitter couldn’t cut it.”</p><p>“The Dragon Apricot said that I was unconscious for half an hour. This meant that when I fell out of this Ultimate Giant’s empty shell, its strength was at the Saint Stage.”</p><p>“After all, with the passing of time, the quality of this giant shell would deteriorate…”</p><p>“But Saint Stage referred to the state when no one controlled it.”</p><p>“If I’m inside and have spiritual intelligence, would even a demi-saint be unable to withstand a punch from an Ultimate Giant?”</p><p>“F*ck, it’s really huge!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but exclaim, “This second awakening is even more violent than the Berserk Giant!”</p><p>A height of over ten thousand feet, and this was only his first transformation. The Ultimate Giant truly lived up to its name.</p><p>Such a height…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou dreamed of his return to Abyss Island.</p><p>At that time, if he had this skill, the void attendant would be his younger brother. The Divine Oracle would only dare to fart in front of him after it was released!</p><p>However, the materialization of the giant shell had drained all of Xu Xiaoshou’s power, but it would not last forever.</p><p>As time passed, the spiritual energy on the Ultimate Giant’s empty shell gradually drained away and its strength also started to weaken. Its hardness also decreased.</p><p>As he looked at it now, the Ultimate Giant’s eyeballs had already turned into spiritual energy as repayment to the world.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou guessed that in about two hours, the giant shell would melt away and not even the bones would be left.</p><p>“If I break through to the demi-saint realm, the total amount of Holy Power will increase exponentially. It can be used by the Ultimate Giant to undergo a qualitative change.”</p><p>“Would I be able to leave behind an immortal giant shell with just one transformation</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou began to ponder.</p><p>Soon, he gave up on the unrealistic idea. After all, he still had a long way to go before he reached the demi-saint Spiritual Cultivation realm.</p><p>“Senior, what did you think of that punch just now?” He flashed in front of the Dragon Apricot and asked.</p><p>“It’s a pity.” The Dragon Apricot Spirit said concisely.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew what the ancestral tree’s thoughts were. “What if I had stayed rational? Can this punch fight against a Holy Emperor?” He asked.</p><p>When he asked this question, Xu Xiaoshou already had his own answer. After all, he had fought a strand of Wangze Holy Emperor’s thought incarnation and received the power of the Four Divine Pillars.</p><p>These were all precious battle experiences of the Holy Emperor!</p><p>A solemn look appeared in the Dragon Apricot Spirit’s eyes. It looked intently at this human kid who was only at the Sovereign Dao Realm cultivation level and nodded.</p><p>“Maybe.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou heard the affirmation and immediately laughed. “Senior, have you ever seen anyone who is as invincible as me in your lifetime?”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit really wanted to nod and kill this brat’s indomitable spirit, but after a long time, it sighed.</p><p>“Not that many.”</p><p>“I think there’s none?” Xu Xiaoshou snorted as if he had seen through its bluff. He put his hands behind his back, thrust his chest out and strutted about.</p><p>It was as if he looked up into the sky and felt something. After he pondered for a while, he waved his sleeves and sighed.</p><p>“There had never been such a prodigy like me in a hundred generations. It’s rare for an expert to appear in ten thousand years. Senior, you came to my Apricot Realm at the right time.”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit was really shocked by this fellow’s ‘arrogance’ this time.</p><p>This kid…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou used his Perception to look at the bewildered expression of the spirit of the ancestral tree behind him. He could not help but laugh.</p><p>He now understood why so many people in the Eastern Region pursued Bazhun’an.</p><p>Eighth Brother was indeed a little pretentious. His heart energy was high and his strength was incomparable. He really had something!</p><p>As soon as his thoughts converged, Xu Xiaoshou saw the Apricot Realm that had become like a post war Abyss Island. His heart ached so much that he almost could not breathe.</p><p>“The Ultimate Giant is too strong. With just one transformation, it shattered half of the Apricot Realm…”</p><p>“Although this world has just been established, the space is unstable, the laws are incomplete, and there are no spiritual arrays to protect it.”</p><p>“But this is too exaggerated!”</p><p>“Fortunately the Dragon Apricot protected the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer and protected my lifeblood…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at another herb garden.</p><p>It had been ruined by Greedy the Cat Spirit and then it was revived by Lei Xi’er.</p><p>After this explosion, it was completely gone.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou planned to leave his important stuff with the Dragon Apricot in the future. The ancestral tree probably wouldn’t steal them, but it would definitely protect it if it was in danger.</p><p>After all, dragons loved treasures…</p><p>“If this transformation took place in the Jade Capital City, it doesn’t even require a punch. As long as the capital’s great array can’t withstand it, there would definitely be countless casualties, right?” Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts drifted away.</p><p>There was no doubt that the Ultimate Giant’s second awakening caused him to lose control completely!</p><p>It had been a long time since Xu Xiaoshou had felt this way.</p><p>The last time he lost control like this was when he first tried out the Berserk Giant.</p><p>However, things were different now. Xu Xiaoshou no longer needed to use Xin Gugu to train and control his Berserk Giant..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
