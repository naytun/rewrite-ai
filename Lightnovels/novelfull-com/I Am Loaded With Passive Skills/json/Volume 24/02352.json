Her long skirt gently swayed as she held a small bronze cauldron, her voice serene. On this day, she confidently declared her name, liberated from the compulsion to hide herself from others, all thanks to the empowering words of Feng Yujin.</p><p>He assured her that she no longer needed to fear anyone in the world.</p><p>“Are you Ao Sheng?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou switched his consciousness with Jin Ren.</p><p>He recognized the face, not entirely unfamiliar, having seen it in the jade scroll given by Aunt Xiang.</p><p>Ao Sheng, the new Spirit Division Chief, was a rock-type spiritual cultivator, likely having reached the realm of Upanishad, with talents rivaling those of Yu Lingdi.</p><p>Possessing the sacred physique of a majestic dragon, akin to a humanoid dragon, he could be defined as a dual practitioner of both rock and dragon-type Spiritual Cultivation.</p><p>Upon Yu Lingdi’s promotion to Spirit Division Chief, he had immediately chosen to leave, seemingly unwilling to remain inferior, and embarked on solitary practice in the Dragon Cave.</p><p>One of the rare humans acknowledged by the Dragon Clan in the Dragon Cave!</p><p>In just a few years, he cultivated the Dragon Pearl, capable of transforming scales and becoming a true dragon by consuming dragon blood.</p><p>Apart from not finding the Dragon Apricot in the Dragon Cave and not ingesting its fruit, he achieved everything possible for a human in dragon cultivation.</p><p>Aunt Xiang’s jade scroll spoke highly of him:</p><p>“Spiritual cultivation comparable to Yu Lingdi, halfway into the path of dragon transformation, approaching the level of a Saint.”</p><p>“He is a stubborn one, understanding that mere Spiritual Cultivation can only match Yu Lingdi at most. Therefore, he left as a human and returned as a dragon, practicing both elements.”</p><p>A genius indeed!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had no idea who was stronger between the current Yu Lingdi and Ao Sheng.</p><p>But the fact that this guy had cultivated both paths at such a young age was much stronger than Yu Lingdi, who was blindly following his father’s footsteps, yet aiming to surpass him.</p><p>At least his mindset was liberated and unrestricted.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s success and failure both stemmed from the Water of Upanishad.</p><p>Wasn’t the Water Ghost’s final gambit on Abyss Island, when he gave his son a spear, an attempt to compel him to forge a new path?</p><p>However…</p><p>All these comparisons were among peers, and Xu Xiaoshou had long transcended them.</p><p>“Are you alone?”</p><p>The moment of enlightenment flashed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s spiritual senses covered the entire Four Symbols Secret Realm in an instant, seeing hundreds of people in red and white clothes rushing towards this place.</p><p>Twenty-three breaths.</p><p>He estimated the time it would take for the nearest white-clothed person to arrive and then smiled at Ao Sheng, who stood halfway up the cliff with an extraordinary aura.</p><p>“Are you here to die alone?”</p><p>After a moment of confusion, Ao Sheng burst into laughter.</p><p>“I’ve heard that Lord Shou of the Saint Servant is incredibly arrogant and thinks nothing of others. Indeed, one has to see it to believe it.”</p><p>“I’ve been waiting here for so long, waiting for you, Xu…”</p><p>“No need for small talk.” Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand to interrupt while his gaze restrained Frost Ferret from taking action.</p><p>If it were the rock-type Upanishad, with a bit of intelligence, and still insisted on delaying time…</p><p>Elder Han was undoubtedly strong, but the impact of a demi-saint’s action was too great. Besides, there was no guarantee of instantly defeating Ao Sheng.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew elemental bodies were hard to kill.</p><p>And how to kill an elemental body, Xu Xiaoshou knew better.</p><p>He had studied it.</p><p>“I won’t bully you. I’ll give you three breaths to prepare, reveal all your trump cards…” He paused, looking at Ao Sheng. “Oh, you’re not even in the Higher</p><p>Void yet, just at the Cutting Path stage, right?”</p><p>Just at the Cutting Path stage? Ao Sheng was taken aback.</p><p>Could someone at the Cutting Path Stage be described as “just”?</p><p>An Upanishad spiritual cultivator at the Cutting Path stage could already contend with those in the Higher Void!</p><p>Xiao…”</p><p>“Three.”</p><p>“Interesting! You’re really interesting! But I really can’t underestimate you…” Ao Sheng laughed.</p><p>For the first time, when faced with the imminent countdown to death, he didn’t dare to mock. Instead, after a moment of concentration, he conjured a Power Upanishad Formation beneath his feet.</p><p>Rock Upanishad?</p><p>MO MO showed a hint of emotion.</p><p>Feng Yujin remarked, “The Holy Divine Palace truly produces outstanding talents.”</p><p>The Power Upanishad Formation was extremely bright and expansive.</p><p>Ao Sheng appeared frivolous, but he did have some tricks up his sleeve.</p><p>In an instant, within tens of thousands of miles, the elemental energies were repelled, pure and belonging solely to the rock element. The mountains trembled as if they had a soul.</p><p>“Two.” Xu Xiaoshou remained indifferent to it all.</p><p>Frost Ferret furrowed its brow and shrunk back to its original size.</p><p>Intuition whispered to it that the human lad before it, Ao Sheng, was not an easy kill.</p><p>It had to gather all its strength into one focal point.</p><p>Yet, amidst these mountainous terrains and rocks, it wasn’t certain it could directly exterminate him.</p><p>Moreover, Elder Han’s ghost beast intuition could sense that Ao Sheng’s flesh was not ordinary!</p><p>“Howl!”</p><p>As expected, Ao Sheng below the cliff suddenly roared, his eyes turned blood-red, his body instantly towering.</p><p>A layer of earthy-yellow scales covered his body, a fleshy lump bulged on his head, and his well-proportioned figure became immensely robust, as if he would transform into a dragon the next moment.</p><p>“One.”</p><p>At this point, Xu Xiaoshou finished counting, looking disappointed at Ao Sheng, who remained in his humanoid form.</p><p>“It seems you’re still holding back. Remember to seize the opportunity in your next life.”</p><p>“Arrogant!” Ao Sheng’s eyes burst with crimson. With a bellow, a pearl of light shimmered on his chest.</p><p>At the same time, as Xu Xiaoshou finished counting down, he released the restraint on the Holy Emperor Lv.o Breathing Technique…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The void suddenly ruptured.</p><p>Terrifying suction centered around him, instantly turning the surrounding area into a vacuum.</p><p>Rolling black mist surged, containing the power of forbidden magic, but upon entering his body, it was forcefully transformed due to the loss of its energy source.</p><p>Beneath a thousand feet, the black water of the Black Water Stream surged like it was summoned, roaring as it surged into the sky, turning into towering waves that drenched Ao Sheng’s entire body.</p><p>The Little Frost Ferret “chirped” and uncontrollably smashed towards Lord Shou’s head, but he dodged it by tilting his head.</p><p>Caught off guard, MO MO crashed into Xu Xiaoshou’s arms, who embraced her waist with one hand.</p><p>Just as the power of the Dragon Pearl on Ao Sheng’s chest lit up, his dragon power suddenly vanished, and even his energy reserve and spiritual source were plundered on the spot.</p><p>He only felt the space in front of him tearing apart, revealing a blood-red hue.</p><p>When he regained consciousness, he was about to collide with Xu Xiaoshou’s chest.</p><p>But what prevented him from advancing further, what stopped him in his tracks, was a single finger… “Impossible!”</p><p>Ao Sheng was horrified.</p><p>What kind of evil technique was this?</p><p>There was no record of Xu Xiaoshou having such an ability in the intelligence!</p><p>He sensed that the rock element dispersed between heaven and earth, without exception, was all absorbed into Xu Xiaoshou’s body.</p><p>The Order of the Great Path around him, under a mere glance from Xu Xiaoshou, was forcefully severed by the Green River Sword Boardline formed by the myriad of swords.</p><p>The world around him was instantly exiled; he couldn’t even absorb the rocks and earth energy from the surrounding mountainous terrain.</p><p>And his proud scales, upon contact with Xu Xiaoshou’s fingertip, showed a slight indentation.</p><p>“How is this possible?!”</p><p>Ao Sheng was on the brink of madness, his eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p>He had cultivated for so many years, returning with the mindset of crushing the Spirit Division Chief Yu Lingdi underfoot upon his arrival.</p><p>But now, he was like a fool, under the “suction force” of Xu Xiaoshou, who was as famous as Yu Lingdi, uncontrollably colliding with the opponent’s attack…</p><p>No!</p><p>What kind of attack was this finger then?</p><p>Ten, Ten Sections of the Finger Sword?”</p><p>“The light of ants, how dare it compete with the brilliance of the moon?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said this line with a smile.</p><p>At this moment, time and space were imprisoned by him. He looked at Ao</p><p>Sheng as if watching a baby swinging a giant sword in a distorted manner.</p><p>But it wasn’t until this moment that Xu Xiaoshou finally understood that he and his peers were no longer on the same level.</p><p>Coming back to her senses, MO MO struggled to free Xu Xiaoshou’s grasp around her waist but couldn’t. When she turned her head to look…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>There was a deafening explosion by her ear.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t perform any spiritual techniques, martial arts, or ancient skills.</p><p>He simply flicked a finger at his head…</p><p>Ao Sheng shattered.</p><p>Reduced to ashes..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
