Hallmaster Dao, I was wrong, but when Xu Xiaoshou was conferred the title of sword saint at the last minute, it really had nothing to do with me. He used Rao Yaoyao’s semi-saint person. If you want to blame someone, you can only blame Rao Yaoyao. But no matter what, I, the sword saint, failed to capture him, the new sword saint. I’m guilty. I beg for forgiveness.”</p><p>“Article 48…”</p><p>At the entrance of the Ran Ming Ruins, loud recitals filled with emotion floated down from all directions. They were very penetrative and widespread but there was no fixed location for people to narrow it down to.</p><p>Even the identity of the reciter was forgotten after a brief period of time.</p><p>Under the dark green Yama’s Banquet, Wei Feng’s knees smashed onto the ground. His head hung limply as if he had been killed by the power of the words.</p><p>His whole being was like a pool of softened mud. Other than the bulging veins on his arm that held the broadsword and trembled slightly, no one could tell that this was actually a living person…</p><p>Living Saint.</p><p>MO MO stood at the entrance of the wall and held on to a small bronze cauldron. Her presence seemed non-existent as she blended perfectly into the motionless giant statue on the mural. It was as if she had been petrified.</p><p>“This Xu Xiaoshou! This Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>Feng Yujin was in a totally messed up condition in her mind . After a long time, he finally managed to form a coherent sentence.</p><p>“He! Is! Not! Human!”</p><p>He had only taken on Wei Feng’s role for a short period of time and had already died three thousand times.</p><p>The Little Frost Ferret trembled as it hid in the hole it had dug and did not dare to show its head. It felt that a storm was imminent.</p><p>“Don’t recite anymore, Lord Shou. Please don’t recite anymore… I beg you, please, give them a way out…”</p><p>“A Saint cannot be humiliated. A cornered dog will jump over a wall!” Outside the tunnel, there seemed to be the sound of hurried footsteps.</p><p>But it came and left even at a faster pace!</p><p>The sound of footsteps was so chaotic that it was like a child who accidentally crashed into an adult’s room. He was stunned for a brief period of time, then he observed and listened with extra vigilance.</p><p>‘The Collection of Excuses’ was too perfectly written!</p><p>When Jin Ren read out article number 76, his teasing tone disappeared and he became serious.</p><p>When he read article number 93, his voice became solemn.</p><p>However, when the number exceeded 100, Jin Ren’s heart skipped a beat and he felt afraid.</p><p>“This Elder Dao is really sly, how did he know so much about me?”</p><p>“How is this a ‘Collection of Excuses’? This clearly informed him about the possible variables that might happen in my battle with Wei Feng in an exhaustible manner!”</p><p>“With such a commander-in-chief sitting in the tent, how could Wei Feng lose?”</p><p>Jin Ren paused for a moment and felt that the ‘Collection of Excuses’ had become red hot in his mouth, and he could no longer recite it.</p><p>He raised his eyes and glanced at Wei Feng…</p><p>Wei Feng seemed to be on the verge of death.</p><p>His stimulation was at a point that was visible to the naked eye…</p><p>But this seemed a little too excessive?</p><p>“We’re only at this stage, and you can’t take it anymore?”</p><p>Jin Ren’s heart sank, and he did not dare to recite any further. His spiritual senses quickly swept through the rest of the Collection of Excuses.</p><p>“Article 172…”</p><p>“Article 234…”</p><p>Compared to the total number of 332 articles, Jin Ren had read out less than a third of them.</p><p>Wei Feng was timid before he went into battle. But why did this last article seem a little strange?</p><p>“Article 332 , I’m sorry I scared you…”</p><p>Jin Ren was startled. He looked at the incomplete symbol behind and fell into deep thought.</p><p>Why did it stop there?</p><p>With a strong start but a weak end?</p><p>What about below, there’s nothing below?</p><p>Jin Ren suddenly thought of something, and the hairs on his body stood up slightly. The image of Dao Qiongcang’s smiling face when they first met on Abyss Island flashed across his mind.</p><p>In the disappearing world, his hands trembled and he slowly turned the purple jade scroll over.</p><p>“Buzz.”</p><p>A crude Divine Array formed inside. As Jin Ren flipped the jade scroll, the entire Collection of Excuses disappeared, but a few brand-new words appeared:</p><p>“Article 333…”</p><p>“Ran Ming ruins, Xu Xiaoshou appeared.”</p><p>Below it was a simple diagram of a handshake that expressed the friendliness and cordiality when old friends meet up.</p><p>“F*ck, f*ck, f*ck!”</p><p>It was as if Jin Ren had seen a ghost, and his blood ran cold to the point that even his legs and stomach began to tremble.</p><p>He almost lost control and had a cultivation deviation.</p><p>It was just an attempt…</p><p>However, he suddenly remembered that Dao Qiongcang of Abyss Island had told him that it was the other way around…</p><p>He subconsciously flipped the jade scroll. He didn’t expect that there were really some content there!</p><p>He still remembered that when they analyzed the Mystery Boxes on Abyss Island, Dao Qiongcang had used the 520 Divine Array to trick him.</p><p>At that time, the words ‘Abyss Island, Xu Xiaoshou appeared’ had scared the original body half to death.</p><p>However, the other party could still use self-deception to cover up. Dao Qiongcang’s Divine Secret was extremely brilliant. Perhaps it was just a temporary move that he did not notice. It was impossible for Elder Dao to have thought that his Mystery Boxes would be obtained by him before he landed on Abyss Island in the Yunlun Mountain Range, right?</p><p>Now….</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
