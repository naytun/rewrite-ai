Xu Xiaoshou even waited for half a day and only came out at dawn after he dressed up.</p><p>“Young Master.”</p><p>As soon as they came out of the Exotic Pavilion, Yingying and Qiao’er bowed and smiled sweetly, It was obvious that they had waited for a long time.</p><p>The two women had changed their clothes and had donned green and purple wide-sleeved palace dresses. They were no longer as ‘naked’ as they were a day ago and looked much more presentable.</p><p>Even their makeup had clearly been toned down and they no longer had heavy makeup on. This made them lose some of their cheekiness and they looked more fresh and elegant.</p><p>“Why are you here?”</p><p>The sickly young master fanned himself and quickly got into character. He was quite curious about the change in Yingying and Qiao’er’s outfits.</p><p>In this Exotic Pavilion, it seemed that only Aunt Xiang and Miss Ah Yao were qualified to wear ‘decent’ clothes.</p><p>Of course, now he had to include these two girls.</p><p>“Aunt Xiang ordered us to serve Young Master. This is our only mission.” Yingying blurted out and her tone was filled with curiosity.</p><p>Xu Gusheng looked even more delicate and pretty after being away for a day. He had the aura of a scholar about him.</p><p>In other words, he was more like an ordinary person…</p><p>Even the two women knew that this sickly young master from the Eastern Region was not that simple.</p><p>However, when they were with him, they always found him to be very approachable. They would smile and treat him as if he was any ordinary person.</p><p>This was much easier than when they had to meet Aunt Xiang.</p><p>They always felt that they faced an active volcano that was suppressed when they encountered the latter. They didn’t know when her smile would change and her whole being would explode.</p><p>“Is that so…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded. He was not surprised by Aunt Xiang’s arrangement.</p><p>He really did not have the time to find a few new companions to chat with. Along the way, they would talk about the Central Region and he would gain information in this way.</p><p>Aunt Xiang had arranged this. First, the background should be clean. The rest… It was not important.</p><p>“Come with me. It just so happened that I have to go out today. Lead the way.”</p><p>The sickly young master waved his hand, and Yingying and Qiao’er followed him with smiles on their faces.</p><p>They had overcome the first obstacle!</p><p>At least Young Master Xu didn’t dislike the two of them, so the rest would be easy.</p><p>“Where’s Miss Ah Yao?”</p><p>The three of them went downstairs. Xu Xiaoshou asked as he walked. He remembered the weak woman who could not hold her drink.</p><p>After all, yesterday, Aunt Xiang kept talking about Ah Yao and tried her best to send that woman to his bed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t say it aloud, but he remembered it in his heart.</p><p>Of course, this was mainly because Aunt Xiang had mentioned it too many times. He could not forget it even if he wanted to.</p><p>He only remembered as he thought that Ah Yao would be the one who would receive him today.</p><p>“Miss Ah Yao is still resting. She drank too much wine yesterday.” Qiao’er said.</p><p>“It’s only three cups?” Xu Xiaoshou was puzzled. “It’s been a day. Even pigs have to wake up!”</p><p>“Miss Ah Yao isn’t a Spiritual Cultivator, so her body is quite weak.”</p><p>“That’s really too weak!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou snorted and felt like he was the villain here. The moment he arrived, he had caused the top lady of the Yougui Pavilion to get drunk.</p><p>Fortunately, he didn’t intend to pretend to be a good person. With the help of the two women, he went downstairs and shook his head.</p><p>“You two, let me know when Miss Ah Yao wakes up.”</p><p>“Alright.” A trace of envy flashed in Yingying and Qiao’er’s eyes. Sure enough, all men could not resist Miss Ah Yao’s charms. This sickly young master had pretended to be aloof yesterday, but today, he was also tempted.</p><p>Who knew that the sickly young master would close his folding fan with a snap and laugh as he said.</p><p>“When Miss Ah Yao wakes up, I’ll definitely force her to drink a few more glasses. I want to see if she’s really drunk or just faking it!”</p><p>“To build up alcohol tolerance, one has to drink more…”</p><p>Yingying and Qiao’er were stunned and stopped in their tracks at the same time. They looked at each other speechlessly.</p><p>Was this even a man?</p><p>This was a demon!</p><p>“+(Suspected. Passive Points+)+2.”</p><p>“+(Feared, Passive Points+)+2.”</p><p>As they walked out of the Yougui Pavilion, Old Man Li, who had dark circles under his eyes, also walked out from the side door.</p><p>As he fastened his belt, he leaned against the wall and shook his head as if he was upset about something. His  footsteps were light, and his body looked even more frail.</p><p>“Old Li!” Xu Xiaoshou was amused and shouted.</p><p>What a coincidence. Old Man Li was here, so there was no need for the Yougui Pavilion to prepare the carriage.</p><p>Speaking of which, this Old Li was a little vigorous. Even though it was clearly so fast, but he still stayed on forcibly in the Yougui Pavilion for more than a day.</p><p>As he looked at his weak appearance, Xu Xiaoshou wondered if he would fall the next second after he moved from the wall.</p><p>“Young Master Xu?”</p><p>Old Man Li was also surprised when he raised his head.</p><p>However, he quickly thrust his chest out and forcefully gathered some vitality and vigor before he rushed over. “What a coincidence, Young Master Xu. Do you need a carriage?”</p><p>“We have a carriage.” Yingying rushed over from behind and sized up Old Man Li, but there was no undue disdain on her small face.</p><p>Qiao’er stepped forward to block him off, but she didn’t manage to block him totally. Coincidentally, she was stuck between the sickly young master and Old Man Li.</p><p>The two of them were ordered to serve Young Master Xu well, so they naturally had to consider their safety when they traveled.</p><p>Other people’s carriages definitely couldn’t compare to their own, even if it was a fragrant osmanthus carriage.</p><p>“Oh, I see.” Old Man Li didn’t say much. After all, he was used to being humble. He squeezed out an apologetic smile at the noble Young Master Xu and retreated.</p><p>“We were destined to meet. Today, you will send this young master off!” Xu</p><p>Xiaoshou said and walked toward the carriage without a backvvard glance.</p><p>Yingying and Qiao’er were stunned.</p><p>Old Man Li reacted quickly when he realized who was the real boss here. He exclaimed and hurriedly ran to the side of the carriage to fix the steps.</p><p>He knew that this young master’s body was weak and could not be knocked around..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
