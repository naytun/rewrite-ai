According to Aunt Xiang’s information, this was definitely not a one-sided decision by the Holy Palace.”</p><p>“From the end of the lecture to the start of the trial, it had only been an hour…</p><p>Can a normal person come up with such a rule?”</p><p>“What if a trial-taker was still on vacation in the Eastern Region or was delayed by other matters and can’t make it?”</p><p>“This must be the work of that Elder Dao the Flamboyant!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>He thought he still had a vast amount of time!</p><p>According to the original schedule, he would set up his plans in the next ten days and could take things one step at a time. He would live as comfortably as he did on Abyss Island.</p><p>First, he would go to the Three Incenses to stir up some trouble and pass some confusing information there.</p><p>Then, he would do the same at the intelligence departments of the Holy Divine Palace in the Central Region and make everyone confused.</p><p>He could even send his second true body to Qingyuan Mountain to take a look and invite the ‘peerless genius’ mentioned by Bazhun’an out of the mountain.</p><p>While he stirred up trouble, he would wait for the members of the First Pavilion in the Sky to gather and battle the Seven Sword Deity at the same time to make a name for himself!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had planned everything, but he had forgotten the most important point:</p><p>He was no longer at Abyss Island, but at the Jade Capital City of the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>His opponent was no longer Rao Yaoyao, but the unpredictable Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>“The Saint Servant of Abyss Island was the one who set this up. When he saw that there was no chance, that Elder Dao the Flamboyant chose to give up the game and admit defeat.”</p><p>“He has the upper hand in Jade Capital City, but I have no choice but to accept his offer. I’ve been led by the nose by him. Do I really have to follow him?” Xu Xiaoshou felt a little uncomfortable.</p><p>Back then, when he had kicked Dao Qiongcang away on Abyss Island, he had felt good, but now he was very uneasy.</p><p>This time, the enemy seemed to have used his perspective. He did not care about the various smoke bombs he had set up. With just one attack, he hit the sore spot of the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>Was it a coincidence?</p><p>When he looked up, the crowd on the Golden Phoenix Square had already scattered like birds and beasts.</p><p>As soon as Wei An left, the trial-takers used their supernatural powers and rushed to the Four Symbols Secret Realm located at Gong Yang Mountain.</p><p>Or used escape techniques.</p><p>Or rode on teleportation portals.</p><p>Or there were protectors who gave them a ride…</p><p>To reach Gong Yang Mountain within an hour was extremely difficult for those at the Innate Stage. It was different when they used use various tools.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at most of the people’s choices. He saw many Cutting Path and the protectors of the higher void carrying their own trial-takers as their bodies fused and transformed and escaped in the same direction.</p><p>He saw the vigor and vitality of those young people.</p><p>When he looked beyond at the Gong Yang Mountain that was not visible at all, it seemed to have become an extremely glaring candlelight at night that emitted a fatal attraction.</p><p>“Moths darting toward the fire…”</p><p>“I, am a moth?”</p><p>In a trance, Xu Xiaoshou saw a handsome man dressed in a luxurious robe in the distant sky.</p><p>He held the divine Sinan in his left hand and he formed a seal with the fingers of his right hand. Behind him stood countless people with blurry faces.</p><p>He looked over with a smile and made an inviting gesture in the direction of Gong Yang Mountain.</p><p>“Invitation to a trap?”</p><p>“+(Startled, Passive Points, )+1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou blinked and the illusion disappeared.</p><p>He felt a little uneasy, not sure if his premonition would come true.</p><p>“Maybe it’s just a simple advancement of time?”</p><p>“They’re not worms in my stomach. How would they know that I still have a lot of things to do?”</p><p>Very soon, there were not many people left in the Golden Phoenix Square.</p><p>The large factions who had trial-takers rushed to the Four Symbols Secret Realm together. There was a high chance that they would wait outside from the beginning of the trial to the end before they picked up the participants.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned. He brought the two girls into the carriage and left with the main group. Soon, they disappeared into the crowd.</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao, Great Emperor of the world.”</p><p>On the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, Wei An entered the Saint Hall and felt that this place was too deserted.</p><p>There were only two people present in the huge Council Hall.</p><p>It was said that the Council of Ten and the new six divisions had just been replaced. The major organizations below had also undergone a massive change from the inside out.</p><p>Shouldn’t they be holding all kinds of transfer ceremonies or gather together to hand over the matters before and after? “Wei An, my friend. Long time no see.”</p><p>“Come, have a seat!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang stood up to welcome the guest. He walked down the front entrance of the Holy Palace and sat on the seat that was usually off limits to a demi-saint among the Council of Ten.</p><p>“I heard that there were some problems during your Holy Palace Trial announcement. Did someone cause trouble?” Dao Qiongcang chuckled.</p><p>“It’s just a small matter. It’s not a big deal.” Wei An did not want to talk about about it.</p><p>“That person’s surname is Xu?”</p><p>“Oh? Hallmaster Dao knows him?” Wei An was surprised. He recalled that the troublemaker did have a paper fan in his hand with the words ‘I am Xu Gusheng’. written on it.</p><p>“Yue Gongli mentioned it before…” Dao Qiongcang replied casually and handed over a portrait. “Is this the person?”</p><p>Wei An immediately recognized the guy who looked like he had just recovered from a serious illness.</p><p>However, the man in the portrait was more delicate and handsome and had a less messy appearance. He looked like a good person.</p><p>“That’s right. Is there a problem with this person?” Wei An asked. Dao Qiongcang rolled up the portrait and smiled. “Could be.”</p><p>Could be?</p><p>What did that mean?</p><p>There were several other factions that stirred up trouble in the Golden Phoenix Square. Wei An did not have time to care about these. He quickly changed the topic and got back to the main topic.</p><p>“I have already agreed to your request. The trial time has been advanced to within an hour. This is an unprecedented concession.”</p><p>“You have to know that before this, the Holy Palace Trial would never be so rushed. This would cause us to miss out on many geniuses..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
