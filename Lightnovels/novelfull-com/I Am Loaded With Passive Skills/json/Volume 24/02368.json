Since he was not disrupting the actions of others, he paid him no further attention.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng turned his head and asked, “Does ‘give me a laugh’ have any special meaning?”</p><p>“Nothing. He’s too cheeky, so I thought I’d scare him.”</p><p>“That’s it?”</p><p>“That’s it.”</p><p>“Are you planning to continue using him?” Ai Cangsheng returned to this question. Everyone knew that Yue Gongli’s identity was sensitive—half-moon, half-eight.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang smiled. What did he care about these things?</p><p>As long as the general direction was correct, the process of development, what the intermediary wanted to gain in the process, and what they ultimately obtained—none of it mattered.</p><p>He still used Yue Gongli’s words as an answer: “Trust those you use, and don’t use those you suspect.”</p><p>“Hehe?”</p><p>“Haha?”</p><p>“Hehe?”</p><p>Approaching the Azure Dragon Range, Yue Gongli was still trying to figure out the effect of his laughter on Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>If it were someone else, he would have considered it a trivial prank.</p><p>But if it was Dao Qiongcang…</p><p>Yue Gongli frowned in suspicion. After making sure no one was watching him, he finally confirmed:</p><p>“He really can see me!”</p><p>With a snap, he crushed the communicator.</p><p>Touching his ear again and connecting to the Heavenly Group’s combat channel, Yue Gongli hesitated. Finally, he suppressed his impulse.</p><p>“Array Eye Number Three, Beibei in position.”</p><p>“I encountered Xu Xiaoshou. He… um, blasted me away. I’m not injured.”</p><p>“It’s just a prank. Xu Xiaoshou didn’t use any large-scale explosive Saint Martial Arts. The trial-takers and our people formed a defensive array and stood our ground. He clearly feared the intervention of the Holy Palace.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou has entered the Black Water Stream and will soon reach the Ran</p><p>Ming ruins. Please give instructions.”</p><p>In the Heavenly Group’s combat channel, Beibei reported everything happening outside the Black Water Stream.</p><p>Yue Gongli heard it, and he could sense a hint of anger in the crisp voice. Obviously, she was fooled by the “prank.”</p><p>“Hahaha, little girl, tell me about the prank. I’m very interested in Xu Xiaoshou,” Yue Gongli chuckled.</p><p>But Beibei continued to speak as if she hadn’t heard his request.</p><p>Yue Gongli tried several times to speak but finally realized that he had been muted!</p><p>“Elder Dao the Flamboyant, unmute me! If you don’t, I’ll smash this Heavenly Group’s battle communicator and act alone!” Yue Gongli was furious6.</p><p>“Array Eye Number One, Beibei in position. I’ve entered the Black Water Stream and will soon enter the Ran Ming ruins…” Beibei’s voice paused, a hint of confusion creeping in. “Huh? Senior Yue Gongli, you want to act alone?”</p><p>“Unmuted?” Yue Gongli’s anger turned to joy. “Just kidding, little girl. Now, tell me about the prank.”</p><p>“Quickly, tell me!”</p><p>“Yue Gongli, report your location,” Dao Qiongcang’s voice intervened.</p><p>Yue Gongli glanced up.</p><p>He followed Cen Qiaofu and had come to the edge of a cliff.</p><p>It seemed that a massive explosion had occurred here, flattening the entire mountain peak. Below the cliff, there was a black mist, and the sound of water could be heard.</p><p>“I’m at the Azure Dragon Range. This seems to be the Black Water Stream, right?” Yue Gongli hesitated for a moment, widening his eyes as he reached into his sleeve.</p><p>He pulled out a command token half his height and found that it was slightly tilted forward. The direction it pointed to was the Black Water Stream below.</p><p>Yue Gongli broke into a cold sweat.</p><p>“Ran Ming ruins, Beibei in position. Senior Yue Gongli, isn’t it forbidden to go to the Black Water Stream without orders?” Beibei’s voice rang out at the opportune moment.</p><p>In the Heavenly Group combat channel, there was a faint, cold laugh from Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>He said nothing.</p><p>And he said everything.</p><p>Yue Gongli was infuriated by this laughter, but after glancing at Cen Qiaofu, who was engulfed in lightning, he calmly said:</p><p>“Well done, Beibei. I tested you, and I didn’t expect you to remember the influence of the three God-Slaying Tokens’ guidance power.”</p><p>“Well, little girl, it’s time for you to take over. I have to leave the Four Symbols Secret Realm for now and temporarily escape the influence of the guidance power.”</p><p>“Oh.” Beibei’s crisp voice hesitated, not immediately emerging from the Ran</p><p>Ming ruins. “Hallmaster Dao, what should I do?” “Keep moving forward. Someone will clean up his mess.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>With that, Yue Gongli quietly removed the exclusive communicator of the Heavenly Group’s combat channel from his ear and blocked it with Holy Power.</p><p>Aloft in the sky, he loudly cursed Elder Dao the Flamboyant and, after venting his anger, leaped out of the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>Black Water Stream.</p><p>As Jin Ren entered the black water and descended ten thousand feet, he felt as though he had touched a soft and intangible membrane.</p><p>Crossing that membrane, the scenery before them changed, and they entered a dim yellow ancient ruin.</p><p>This was a giant ruin similar to the Giant Kingdom on the Abyss Island, vast and boundless. Even the sound of footsteps on the black water beach had a faint echo.</p><p>Where they stood was the entrance to the ruin, surrounded by ancient giant murals and scattered giant stones covered in thick black moss.</p><p>“Holy Power is completely forbidden.” Little Frost Ferret poked its head out.</p><p>MO MO surveyed the surroundings, sensing the power of the Spell Forbidden Barrier, and suddenly spoke, “There’s someone.”</p><p>Jin Ren raised his eyes, almost simultaneously looking forward.</p><p>Ahead was a huge passage, and on a giant stone at the entrance sat a short old man dressed in the same color as the black moss.</p><p>He leaned on a broadsword, his head bowed, and his hair disheveled.</p><p>He seemed to be petrified, devoid of any aura.</p><p>But when Jin Ren, MO MO, and Elder Han’s gaze fell on him, the old man in black lifted his head.</p><p>At the entrance of the Ran Ming ruins, an intense killing intent filled the air.</p><p>“I’ve waited for a long time…” “You, are you Xu Xiaoshou?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
