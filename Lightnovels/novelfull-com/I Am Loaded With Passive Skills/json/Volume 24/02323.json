Upon spotting two figures in the room, it recoiled in fear and disappeared.</p><p>Aunt Xiang remained oblivious to it all.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou, through his Perception, saw everything that had just transpired.</p><p>“Xiao Han!”</p><p>The space cracked open with a sound.</p><p>As the familiar voice emerged, a little frost ferret flew out from the crack, rushing towards a face that may have been unfamiliar, yet exuded a remarkably familiar aura.</p><p>“Squeak!”</p><p>“Lord Shou! Xiao Han finally found you!”</p><p>Startled, Aunt Xiang turned her gaze and finally saw the unexpected guest.</p><p>The palm-sized Little Frost Ferret…</p><p>With its fluffy tail raised…</p><p>Was this adorable creature a demi-saint-level ghost beast, the Frost Ferret?</p><p>The one that possessed powerful talents like the Super Saint Escape Technique, allowing it to appear and vanish without a trace?</p><p>“You are Elder Han?”</p><p>Aunt Xiang resisted the urge to reach out and touch the fluffy tail of the white ferret, constantly reminding herself:</p><p>This was a demi-saint!</p><p>The dignity of a Saint was not to be violated!</p><p>Yet, Xu Xiaoshou held the Little Frost Ferret in his palm, caressing it and stroking its fluffy tail.</p><p>He even tossed it into the air, which “Elder Han” seemed to enjoy, and both played merrily.</p><p>Aunt Xiang fell silent for a while.</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Master Xu, may I touch it?” She finally couldn’t resist the temptation of this adorable creature.</p><p>“This is Aunt Xiang.” Xu Xiaoshou observed for a while and realized that “Elder Han” remained the same, just more respectful, even refraining from calling itself “Lord.</p><p>He casually tossed the Little Frost Ferret, saying, “Play as you like.”</p><p>Elder Han immediately knew that this was another character he couldn’t afford to offend. It squeaked weakly and said, “Just call me Xiao Han…”</p><p>Aunt Xiang finally got to touch this lump of snowy whiteness. The feeling of the fluffy fur was extremely comfortable, making it irresistible, almost like a dream.</p><p>“Is this really the Frost Ferret?”</p><p>“Is it really a demi-saint?”</p><p>Having lived for so many years, Aunt Xiang had never seen a demi-saint and ghost beast with such a mild temper.</p><p>Even among the most disreputable demi-saint families on the Shengshen Continent or the most infamous Higher Void Families, none would be so spineless.</p><p>Only after Xu Xiaoshou nodded did Aunt Xiang become certain that there truly existed such a docile demi-saint-level ghost beast in the world.</p><p>“Is this a Legendary Beast Control Artifact?” Xu Xiaoshou noticed an earring on the Little Frost Ferret’s ear.</p><p>“Yes.” Elder Han nodded, “I went to the Xu Yue Grey Palace, and met Palace Master Bai Zhou. He was very kind to me.”</p><p>“Oh? Palace Master Bai Zhou?” Xu Xiaoshou asked with curiosity, “What kind of person is he?”</p><p>“He is not a person.” Elder Han shook its head, “Like me, he is also a Saint Beast, just suppressing his strength and not breaking through. He is powerful; I can feel it.</p><p>Was he also an original ghost beast?</p><p>Was his humanoid form merely an adaptive disguise for human society, concealing an unknown true form?</p><p>“I’m asking about his personality.”</p><p>“He has a good personality and treats me well. He wants to recruit me, provides delicious food and drinks daily, and encourages me to stay in the Xu Yue Grey Palace as an elder, assuring a future without worries.</p><p>Pausing for a moment, Elder Han added, “He loves to drink. After drinking, he treats me even better. He’s a good… um, person.”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Xu Xiaoshou knew that he wouldn’t get much information from Elder Han.</p><p>Indeed, as one of the members of the “Great Fool and Dimwit,” how could it not be bought off?</p><p>“You should stay there and find out about their defensive force and the location of the treasure vault.’</p><p>“When I go there, you lead the way. After we finish our business, we’ll empty the Xu Yue Grey Palace and make a run for it.”</p><p>“That way, they’ll have to cooperate with us.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang looked up in shock at Xu Xiaoshou as if she was looking at a demon.</p><p>Elder Han pondered for a moment, “I’ll remember that. I’ll take note.”</p><p>“Now you don’t have time to go. In the Four Symbols Secret Realm, focus on keeping yourself alive first.” Xu Xiaoshou chuckled.</p><p>Elder Han shivered.</p><p>It knew it came with a mission.</p><p>“By the way, Lord Shou, there’s another person who went to the Xu Yue Grey</p><p>Palace. She is also here at Jade Capital City.”</p><p>Who?”</p><p>“She said she’s from the First Pavilion in the Sky and is called MO Mo.”</p><p>The Holy Emperor Fengtian, Feng Yujin?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was taken aback, grabbed Elder Han, and examined him up and down, but found no wounds. His expression became strange, “You didn’t get played to death?”</p><p>Elder Han was puzzled, “Why do you say that?”</p><p>It seemed it only met MO MO, not Feng Yujin…</p><p>Was it because MO MO prevented them from meeting?</p><p>But really, in just a couple of months, they went together to the Xu Yue Grey Palace.</p><p>Was this Frost Ferret unaware of Feng Yujin’s existence?</p><p>“You’re really a smart one.”</p><p>“Squeak.” The Little Frost Ferret laughed, “Thank you for the praise, Lord</p><p>Shou.”</p><p>“Where’s MO MO?”</p><p>“Oh, her. She asked me to tell you, ‘When necessary, I will appear, and he will help.”‘</p><p>Indeed, these sounded like something MO MO would say, but…</p><p>Feng Yujin would help too?</p><p>Did the sun rise from the west?</p><p>In the Abyss Island, he didn’t even see a trace of him. Yet, he would participate in the Four Symbols Secret Realm?</p><p>Was he threatened by someone… Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his chin, frowning as he pondered who could threaten a Holy Emperor.</p><p>“MO MO, is she the girl with the seal attribute?” Aunt Xiang interjected.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Seeing Xu Xiaoshou nod, Aunt Xiang knew she was the ghost beast host body of the Holy Emperor Fengtian..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
