Restriction! Ban!”</p><p>As soon as this voice sounded, the Four Symbols Secret Realm resembled the site of a natural disaster. It rumbled and shook violently.</p><p>Shengshen Continent, Gong Yang Mountain Land Realm.</p><p>Yue Gongli’s Holy Power was sealed. When everyone looked up, they saw a huge Gray Fog Hand that protruded from above the Nine Heavens.</p><p>How magnificent! How shocking! How thrilling!</p><p>The Gray Fog Hand contained the power of a Holy Emperor. Even Cen Qiaofu’s calamity clouds were easily broken through. He ignored all the rules and went directly toward it.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Qilin realm, where the Four Symbols Secret Realm was located, was one of the 132 realms in the Central Region. A loud explosion sounded in the sky, followed by a huge crack.</p><p>An extradimensional space crack!</p><p>If the red-clothed people had been present, they would have been able to tell that this crack had already surpassed the size of all the extradimensional space cracks in the current era. It was the largest!</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators of the Qilin Realm could see everything clearly within a 300,000-kilometer radius of the Gong Yang Mountain Land Realm. Their shock was no less than when the phantom Demonic Emperor Black Dragon appeared in the Eastern Region.</p><p>But this time, it was different.</p><p>What they saw was the Gray Fog Hand that covered the sky reaching down and grabbing a nearly spherical translucent space.</p><p>This oval space was originally intangible and was associated with the</p><p>Shengshen Continent. It was like a tumor that mutated in the human body.</p><p>However, under the binding force of the Gray Fog Hand, it was forced to reveal itself. The living beings inside moved, and the vegetation submitted.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Yue Gongli stood on the Antelope Peak and felt the power of the Nine Heavens sink downward. His back was bent slightly by the pressure.</p><p>He struggled as his eyes widened.</p><p>“World! Restriction! Ban!”</p><p>When the calm and melodious Saint Language came from the Four Symbols Secret Realm and spread throughout the entire Qilin World, it fell into everyone’s ears.</p><p>Yue Gongli finally realized what the oval space that was trapped by the Gray Fog Hand was.</p><p>“Four Symbols Secret Realm!”</p><p>This hand grabbed the entire space of the Four Symbols Secret Realm into its palm and caught hold of the sun and the moon!</p><p>Yue Gongli’s scalp went numb. He couldn’t believe his eyes.</p><p>“The Sealing Power, the power of a Holy Emperor…”</p><p>“The Holy Emperor Fengtian had made his move? How did he recover so quickly?”</p><p>“How dare he attack so openly? Did Elder Dao the Flamboyant know about</p><p>Yue Gongli hurriedly dialed the Heavenly Group’s battle channel, but all he heard was a busy tone.</p><p>Heaven’s secrets were hidden below the Holy Emperor!</p><p>After all, Dao Qiongcang was only a demi-saint. The Heavenly Group’s battle channel could not flip the sky and could not escape Feng Yujin’s ‘World Restriction Ban’!</p><p>The entire Qilin realm fell into a temporary silence under the power of this Holy Emperor’s spiritual technique.</p><p>This was the case in the Qilin realm.</p><p>It was the same in the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>The God of Killing Wei Feng was at the center of the suppression of the Gray Fog Hand, so he naturally could not escape from this disaster.</p><p>The Immortal Slay shattered.</p><p>The Yama’s Banquet trembled.</p><p>Wei Feng’s eyes seemed about to pop out, but he was looking at MO Mo’s figure, which had returned to its corporeal form from the distance… No, it should be said that it was the Holy Emperor Fengtian Feng Yujin’s figure whose back was bent at almost a ninety-degree angle.</p><p>Wei Feng let out a hysterical roar.</p><p>His God of Killing domain still tried to confront the Gray Fog Hand as his pride stubbornly resisted.</p><p>However, it seemed like it was only a matter of time before he was defeated.</p><p>Jin Ren had long since awakened.</p><p>He could not use his Moment of Enlightenment.</p><p>He didn’t even need to activate his Vanishing Technique and Independence skills.</p><p>He only stared at the scene in front of him with his mouth agape and felt a chill in his heart.</p><p>Finally, he looked at Feng Yujin, who was engulfed in the gray fog. He stretched his hand out and scratched his head.</p><p>This guy…</p><p>I defeated him once in the Outer Yard Windcloud competition and once again at the Tianxuan Gate. Then at the White Cave Spirit Fusion Swamp, you still want to chase after him?</p><p>Junior Sister MO, what kind of demon are you restraining…</p><p>At this point, Jin Ren seemed to understand why they always said and even</p><p>Bazhun’an said.</p><p>“The era of the ancient swordsman had long passed.”</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivation is the Formal Path!</p><p>The Holy Emperor Fengtian Feng Yujin looked at the stubborn old man in front of him silently as he fought against the unfair fate.</p><p>After a while, he slowly closed his eyes.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Gray Fog Hand of the Shengshen Continent split into a phantom and came out from the huge crack in the Four Symbols Secret Realm and pressed down on the Black Water Stream.</p><p>“Pfft…</p><p>Wei Feng spat out a mouthful of blood as he was knocked to the ground and pressed deep into the pit.</p><p>His God of Killing domain actually hadn’t shattered yet. From a spherical shape, it was pressed into a round pancake shape and thereafter it prostrated on the ground.</p><p>Feng Yujin was moved.</p><p>At this point, he still refused to give up?</p><p>“An ant will always be an ant. A demi-saint will always be a demi-saint.”</p><p>“Your vision only allowed you to set your sights on the small Ran Ming ruins.</p><p>You’ve looked at the sky from the bottom of a well and became arrogant. Little did you know…”</p><p>The Gray Fog Hand clenched and grasped the air.</p><p>With a shout, the semi-saint person above Wei Feng’s head was forced out.</p><p>“My status is above yours!”</p><p>Feng Yujin opened his eyes and looked down. His eyes were cold and indifferent.</p><p>“I said that I would leave your corpse intact, so…”</p><p>“Stop your resistance..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
