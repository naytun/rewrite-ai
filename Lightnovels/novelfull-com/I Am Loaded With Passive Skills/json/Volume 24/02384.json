Chapter 2384: Provoking The Benevolent To Fury (1)</h1><p>Chapter 2384: Provoking the Benevolent to Fury (1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>The world had suddenly turned ethereal.</p><p>The trial-takers of the Four Symbols Secret Realm, the red and white-clothed people, and even the depths of everyone’s souls resonated with the crisp sound of droplets falling and rippling.</p><p>“Drip, drop!”</p><p>It echoed from nowhere, cleansing the souls and spirits.</p><p>As goosebumps spread and pores opened, it seemed to also siphon away some power.</p><p>At that moment, everyone raised their gaze, and the world before their eyes had faded into shades of pure black, gray, and white.</p><p>A wisp of cold mist summoned the spirits, sketching out the ink-painted azure sky.</p><p>In the airspace of the Four Symbols Secret Realm, a hazy mist condensed, and within a blink of an eye, a furious tide surged three hundred feet high out of nowhere!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>After the deafening roar, the waves anchored themselves in nothingness, like the sturdiest shield under the sky, pushing forward from behind Cen Qiaofu, shielding him from all harm.</p><p>“Long time no see, Ai Cangsheng, I’ve returned.”</p><p>As he strode upon the waves, Water Ghost held his left hand to his face while clutching a spear in his right, a subtle smile playing on his lips.</p><p>His long hair danced in the wind, his robes billowed, and with the force of the sea at his command, he thrust his spear fiercely at a dark streak shooting through the air.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The Arrow of Evil Sin Bow that Cen Qiaofu couldn’t ever shatter exploded.</p><p>The evil energy splattered into the air was intercepted by the sky-shrouding water curtain, completely absorbed without a trace escaping.</p><p>The seas contain all rivers, accommodating all things.</p><p>The ink-like black seawater remained unaffected by the residual power of the Evil Sin Bow, absorbing everything.</p><p>And Water Ghost did not retreat an inch!</p><p>“Ai Cangsheng, you’ve grown weaker…”</p><p>Hearing this, Cen Qiaofu was momentarily stunned.</p><p>He looked up at the Nine Heavens, slightly parting his lips as if he hadn’t yet returned from his shock.</p><p>Above the void, the Original Sealing Spear bent under force but smoothly swirled in Water Ghost’s hand, from his left waist to his right palm, like a dragon shaking off water, aiming directly at the second arrow.</p><p>With a shake of his arm, Water Ghost only produced a few silver-white spear flowers from the tip of the Original Sealing Spear before piercing through the void and Great Path, straight toward the second arrow.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Another Arrow of Evil Sin Bow exploded.</p><p>This time, the power carried by the arrow seemed to be completely sealed, not even able to splash out.</p><p>Water Ghost not only didn’t retreat but instead advanced half a step, his lips curling into a smirk:</p><p>“Truly disappointing…”</p><p>Everyone below widened their eyes.</p><p>One spear shattering one arrow, who could this figure be?</p><p>Compared to the tyrannical Sea God’s Trident, the Original Sealing Spear was much finer, adding a touch of flexibility.</p><p>With these two long-handled weapons, Water Ghost wielded them as naturally as if they were his arms!</p><p>As one of the nine supreme divine weapons, the Original Sealing Spear, which rivaled the Evil Sin Bow, was only used for its sealing attribute in Yan Wuse’s hands.</p><p>In the hands of Water Ghost, the Original Sealing Spear seemed to possess a soul.</p><p>When the third black streak shot through the air, Water Ghost smiled.</p><p>“A mantis trying to stop a chariot!”</p><p>The ink-colored world suddenly lit up with a Power Upanishad Formation that engulfed the entire Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>All trial-takers swore they had never seen such an array diagram.</p><p>Seldom did arrays, or even spiritual arrays, have the capability to cover an entire extradimensional space.</p><p>And now, this intricate and dazzling Power Upanishad Formation unfolded beneath Water Ghost’s feet.</p><p>He was relaxed, casual, as if performing an effortless feat.</p><p>The array was so vast that it extended from the extradimensional space to cover the entire Shengshen Continent, obscuring the Gong Yang Mountain.</p><p>“Take this!”</p><p>Inside the Four Symbols Secret Realm, Water Ghost’s spear met the arrowhead, swirling into a vortex, simultaneously retreating and rolling, discharging the force of the Evil Sin Bow’s arrow!</p><p>The waves beneath his feet were drawn into the force of the Original Sealing Spear, turning into towering waterspouts, the sound of water rumbling like thunder.</p><p>Retreating to Cen Qiaofu’s side, Water Ghost effortlessly wielded the spear with one hand, while the other supported his golden beast mask. With a malevolent grin, he turned his head to taunt:</p><p>“Senior Cen, giving up already?”</p><p>“Have you reached the age where you begin to doubt if you’re truly the protagonist of your own destiny?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu glared at him but was somewhat surprised inwardly.</p><p>He knew that the Chief and this person had only interacted once, leading to the situation with Abyss Island.</p><p>Water Ghost was listed as the fifth seat among the Saint Servants.</p><p>But in ordinary times, he had little involvement, only contributing a bit of intelligence—this person was aloof and too difficult to deal with.</p><p>However, after the battle at Abyss Island, with his title as a demi-saint of Upanishad, his noble status was second only to the Holy Emperor.</p><p>This man might not even obey the Chief’s commands now!</p><p>So, why would he come here?</p><p>“Be careful.”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu glanced at the Arrow of Evil Sin Bow deflected towards him, and he couldn’t suppress his fear as he cautioned.</p><p>Unperturbed, Water Ghost shook his head with a chuckle, only glancing back at the Nine Heavens:</p><p>“Courtesy demands reciprocity!”</p><p>With a mighty swing, the Arrow of Evil Sin Bow was deflected by the force of the spear, sent back from where it came, shooting across the sky.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The vast sky exploded with a deafening noise.</p><p>The black and red arrow, connected by the Water of Great Path, traversed all things in the world, ignoring spatial distances…</p><p>It pierced through the Four Symbols Secret Realm, tore through the sky above</p><p>Gong Yang Mountain, flew over Jade Capital City, and headed towards Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe!</p><p>On the cliff above Black Water Stream, the white and red-clothed people held their heads, their eyes filled with fear.</p><p>In the Path Principles of the Four Symbols Secret Realm, Wei An’s eyelids twitched, his eyes containing a trace of astonishment as he stared at the man with the golden beast mask.</p><p>On the Antelope Peak of Gong Yang Mountain, Yue Gongli covered his forehead with his hand, his eyes following the arrow flying across the horizon, his mouth forming a circle:</p><p>“Wow…</p><p>Countless spiritual cultivators in Jade Capital City looked into the distance upon hearing the sound, only to see the Arrow of Evil Sin Bow returning.</p><p>At the moment it hit Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, a thunderous roar echoed through the Nine Heavens..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
