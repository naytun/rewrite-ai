Old Man Li’s energy reserve had no fluctuation of spiritual source, but there were a few bandages wrapped around his abdomen under his slightly messy clothes. There were signs of a seal.</p><p>“On Abyss Island, he is a higher void, right?”</p><p>“But he’s too hidden. If he’s attacked, I’m afraid he won’t even have the time to undo the seal.”</p><p>“Li Fugui, you’re risking your life to play the role of a coachman!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou admired these pure intelligence workers.</p><p>He was different. He had all kinds of passive skills and could play all kinds of tricks.</p><p>He didn’t even need much training to be able to play the role of someone else and play with the enemy.</p><p>Li Fugui was much purer. He could only rely on his own ability.</p><p>If anything went wrong, he would die without a burial place!</p><p>“Young Master Xu, you also heard that today is the day the Holy Palace announced the trial?” Outside the carriage, Old Man Li’s chatter started again.</p><p>Or rather, he had not stopped since he got on the carriage.</p><p>He didn’t feel anything when he heard it previously, but now that he thought about it again, he could only say that Old Li was thoroughly conscientious. His words were full of information.</p><p>The Holy Palace Trial was about to be announced? Was this the big deal that Aunt Xiang was talking about? Xu Xiaoshuo was still playing the role of a sickly young master. Lying on Yingying’s lap, he opened his mouth to wait for Qiao’er’s grape and swallowed it.</p><p>“You know about it too?”</p><p>“That’s right. Old Li is relying on this to make a living. Although this news has only spread not long ago, everyone soon found out about it on the eve of the Holy Palace’s trial and went to watch.”</p><p>“Then tell me.”</p><p>“Alright! The Holy Palace Trial will be held at the Golden Phoenix Square. I heard that the Holy Palace’s emissary this time is from the Infernal lineage.”</p><p>“I know, it’s that one called ‘Hua Ying’ ,” Qiao’er pinched the grape and suddenly spoke. Her resistance was useless. She had already joined the camp of chatting and no longer dared to look down on Old Man Li. This person seemed to be quite to Young Master Xu’s liking.</p><p>“I’ve heard of her too. Rumor has it that she’s the Martial Nephew of the Seven</p><p>Sword Immortal, Xu Xiaoshou. It’s so chaotic. The Saint Servants, the Holy</p><p>Palace, and the Holy Divine Palace. I always feel like they’re one family.” Yingying smiled and lowered her eyes, intoxicated by the sickly young master’s peerless appearance.</p><p>Old Man Li was amused. He chuckled and said, “I feel the same way. I can only say that the world of big shots is really chaotic. The commoners can’t understand it.”</p><p>“Right, Young Master Xu, the announcement of the Holy Palace’s trial should be about the time for the trial.” Old Man Li added.</p><p>“Isn’t that normal?” Xu Xiaoshou was puzzled.</p><p>If they weren’t announcing the time and place, then what would they announce?</p><p>He vaguely remembered that when he first met Aunt Xiang, she had said that the Holy Palace Trial would be held in eleven or twelve days.</p><p>“It’s very normal, but at this juncture, I heard that it will become abnormal…Yes, it’s hearsay.” Old Man Li said.</p><p>Something had happened…Xu Xiaoshou recalled Aunt Xiang’s words and sat up straight. Just as he was about to speak, Old Man Li sighed outside the carriage.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, we’re here.”</p><p>Only then did Xu Xiaoshou notice the two words “Golden Phoenix” hanging in the sky above the bustling square. He realized that this was the place that Aunt Xiang had mentioned.</p><p>The grocery store was quite close to Golden Phoenix Square.</p><p>However, the prosperity of the two was completely different.</p><p>The former was in the capital and no one cared about it, but Golden Phoenix Square was now packed with all kinds of people.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, all kinds of luxurious carriages were lined up at the edge. The people inside were all important figures with extraordinary status.</p><p>However, these people could only gather outside the square.</p><p>In the innermost part of the square were all kinds of extraordinary young talents, and there were more than a thousand of them!</p><p>Most of them were only at the Innate or Master Stage, but some of them had auras that even a Sovereign couldn’t compare to.</p><p>Holding a sword and a saber, holding a spear and wielding a halberd…Each has their own weapon.</p><p>Behind these unruly and magnificent young people, there was a vague “force” that could not be seen by outsiders.</p><p>Just this “force” alone could push out the invisible people protecting them. Their cultivation level was no lower than a Cutting Path and Higher Void.</p><p>“These are the peerless geniuses selected by the five regions to participate in the Holy Palace Trial,” Old Man Li got off the carriage and introduced.</p><p>That’s right, if he threw a Saint Seeds on All Five Fingers here, the Shengshen Continent would go back 50 years…Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath and knew that he was no longer in the same world as those people.</p><p>While they were still worried about what would happen in the Holy Palace Trial, Xu Xiaoshou was already thinking about how to deal with Dao Qiongcang and how to turn the Four Symbols Secret Realm upside down.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lowered the curtains of the carriage. Even through the soundproof barrier, he could feel the noise outside. With a rough sweep of his Perception, there were no less than tens of thousands of people here.</p><p>Although they were not from the same world, he could interfere with them…</p><p>“Let’s alight!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his paper fan and returned with pride.</p><p>This plaza was the place he should be!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
