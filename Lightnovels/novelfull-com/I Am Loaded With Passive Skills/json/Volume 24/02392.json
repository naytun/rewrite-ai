There was no Dao Qiongcang on the mountain or in the hall!</p><p>This person who was supposed to be in charge of the Saint Hall and was the soul of the Heavenly Group’s battle was nowhere to be seen at such a critical moment!</p><p>Yue Gongli felt a chill in his heart that was even stronger than his Yin attribute.</p><p>In front of the Saint Hall, there were only Ai Cangsheng who held the Evil Sin</p><p>Bow and the Ninth Divine Priest.</p><p>Yue Gongli didn’t even greet them and immediately asked.</p><p>“Where’s Dao Qiongcang?”</p><p>His question was even tinged with a layer of fear of the unknown.</p><p>“At the Stairway to Heaven.” Ai Cangsheng’s tone was calm.</p><p>Stairway to Heaven… Yue Gongli closed his eyes and felt a sense of loss that slipped through his hands like quicksand.</p><p>He held onto something.</p><p>But it seemed like it was too late.</p><p>As for the two Saints in front of him, they lived within the safe confines of the Saint mountain. It was likely that they did not notice the danger or were even aware of it.</p><p>“How long has he been gone? How long will he be gone? When will he be back?” Yue Gongli only wanted to grasp more things and find a way out for himself. “He just left not too long ago. He should be back soon.”</p><p>After Ai Cangsheng stopped speaking, he stared at Yue Gongli’s thought incarnation.</p><p>He looked at the anxious expression on the person’s face and frowned. He then looked at his Evil Sin Bow and said thoughtfully, “I’ve caused trouble…”</p><p>“It’s not a big problem.”</p><p>Yue Gongli pursed his lips and shook his head. “You only shot a few arrows. The impact was not that great. I just noticed the problem.”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng raised his head but did not speak.</p><p>At this moment, his problem was still on the way. Yue Gongli would soon know what ‘not a big problem’ was.</p><p>“What are you talking about?” The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body placed her hands behind her back. She did not understand what the two of them spoke about.</p><p>“Don’t ask. I don’t have time to explain to you.” Yue Gongli then looked at Ai Cangsheng. “Where’s Dao Qiongcang?”</p><p>The conversation between smart people were always direct to the core.</p><p>Since the process was irreversible, it could only be remedied later.</p><p>As long as Dao Qiongcang could return, there would be room for redemption. Dao Qiongcang could definitely fix the blind spot that he could not see!</p><p>“I’ll contact him now.”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng did not say anything else. He drew his bow and shot an arrow up the Stairway to Heaven and it disappeared at the edge of the world.</p><p>After he did that, he raised his head and hesitated for a moment before he said.</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>What?</p><p>Yue Gongli was stunned. He wanted to ask, “Why are you sorry?”</p><p>With a bang, his demi-saint thought incarnation shattered and he died Instantly.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>An Arrow of Evil God pierced through the clouds and the moon.</p><p>It came from the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe and cut through the Jade Capital City. The remaining energy leaked out and polluted the entire capital’s sky.</p><p>The trio colors of greyish-black and red of an evil nature and the power of evil sin continuously mixed as they broke through the sky and became increasingly turbulent.</p><p>Wherever it passed, the Dao technique collapsed and the space turned into dust.</p><p>It was like a huge hand that pulled a black curtain over the world and covered the sky in dozens of realms in the Eastern Region.</p><p>In the end, it invaded the Qilin world and landed on Gong Yang Mountain.</p><p>At the Antelope Peak, Yue Gongli covered his head and screamed.</p><p>He had a little secret. He was afraid of pain since he was young, especially attacks from sharp objects. He just did not show it in front of outsiders for the sake of his image.</p><p>The demi-saint’s thought incarnation sent a trace of his soul, and the connection between it and his main body was suddenly shattered by the power of the Arrow of Evil God.</p><p>The pain that this brought was like thousands of needles that pierced his mind.</p><p>It was ten times more terrifying than being whipped by his sister!</p><p>“F*cking Ai Cangsheng…”</p><p>“So you didn’t just shoot a few arrows. You even shot out such a d*mn thing. You deserve to die!”</p><p>“How dare you say ‘sorry’… D*mn your mother!”</p><p>The Arrow of Evil God fell from the sky.</p><p>The power of the ancestral source broke through all the space in various directions, and even the Order of the Great Path could not escape from it.</p><p>Yue Gongli stopped his resistance, grabbed the God -Slaying Token, and fled in embarrassment.</p><p>The power of the ancestral source!</p><p>It was so condensed and shot out from one of the nine supreme divine weapons and it came from a demi-saint…</p><p>Who would dare to play with this thing for no reason unless they had no other choice?</p><p>Whoever blocked it would die!</p><p>There was no suspense.</p><p>The sky of the Four Symbols Secret Realm was instantly shattered by the power of the Arrow of Evil God. The entire small world shook.</p><p>Feng Yujin’s attack could be said to still contain some scruples. He used the world taboo to capture the Four Symbols Secret Realm, but he only squeezed out a small gap. Then, he split a portion of the power to dissolve the Gray Fog Hand and also to suppress Wei Feng.</p><p>In that case, the arrow that Ai Cangsheng, who hadn’t realized that he had been under a Guidance, had shot out was really to destroy Water Ghost and defend the dignity of the Holy Divine Palace!</p><p>The reason why Water Ghost left and returned…</p><p>Just as Wei An thought, he knew that he had been locked onto by the Eyes of the Great Path.</p><p>No matter where they went, the Arrow of Evil God would follow them. They could just as well have hidden under Saint Guardian Wei Ann’s turtle shell and fight it together.</p><p>Everything developed as expected.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang ascended the Stairway to Heaven, Ai Cangsheng shot out the Arrow of Evil God and Water Ghost and Wei An walked together.</p><p>The sky of the Four Symbols Secret Realm had collapsed…</p><p>Boom!</p><p>When the arrow completely covered up the shame between the extradimensional space and the Shengshen Continent, the power of guidance in the dark completely revealed its fangs.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>Outside the Gong Yang Mountain, Yue Gongli didn’t run far. He could not hold on any longer to the God -Slaying Token in his hand and he flew backward.</p><p>He stopped, sighed, and looked back.</p><p>Bows were laid out horizontally, and sheep buried their heads. A huge black hole had collapsed at the entrance of the secret realm..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
