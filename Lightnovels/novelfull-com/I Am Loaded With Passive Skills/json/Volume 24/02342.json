Your Holy Palace would not want such a person.”</p><p>Wei An just listened quietly and did not add on to the attack of the traitors of the Infernal lineage. He said calmly.</p><p>“I’ve done what you wanted, and what I want is also very clear.”</p><p>“For the Holy Palace Trial, The Holy Palace is in charge of the Holy Palace, and the Holy Divine Palace is in charge of the Holy Divine Palace. We will mind our own business.”</p><p>“Your matter must not affect the trial-takers in the slightest. This was my promise to the trial-takers… Can you do it?” “Naturally.” Dao Qiongcang nodded. “I will try my best.”</p><p>“Try your best?” Wei An’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>“Nothing is absolute, and I can’t guarantee that nothing would happen. I can only guarantee that I’ll do my best.” Dao Qiongcang smiled.</p><p>Wei An looked intently at this taciturn Divine Sorcerer, who seemed to be very sincere.</p><p>He let out a long sigh and stopped dwelling on the matter. He looked around and said, “The Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe is very deserted. Where are your people?” “They’ve all been sent out.”</p><p>“Where to?”</p><p>“Naturally, to the Four Symbols Secret Realm to protect the trial-takers.”</p><p>How could Wei An listen to such nonsense? They were all sent out to carry out their own missions, right?</p><p>He turned to look at the silent Ai Cangsheng and muttered, “Emperor</p><p>Cangsheng, it’s been decades since you left the Saint Mountain, right?”</p><p>“Twenty-eight years.” Ai Cangsheng’s legs were covered with a black cloth, and his hands were placed on the Evil Sin Bow as he spoke calmly.</p><p>Wei An nodded and looked at Dao Qiongcang. “Why was Emperor Cangsheng not allowed out? It must be uncomfortable to stay in one place all year round.” “It’s not convenient due to his legs.” Dao Qiongcang smiled and pointed.</p><p>“You know that’s not what I meant.” Wei An shook his head.</p><p>“You should know that what you understood is not what I meant.” Dao Qiongcang smiled and shook his head.</p><p>Wei An fell silent.</p><p>It had been decades since they last met, but this Elder Dao the Flamboyant’s words still made one want to hit him hard with a weapon.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was still very respectful toward the Holy Palace. He added.</p><p>“We can’t all rush into the Four Symbols Secret Realm, right?”</p><p>“Someone has to keep an eye outside to prevent any accidents.”</p><p>Wei An looked up and glanced at Dao Qiongcang. He was aware that he was not joking.</p><p>He then turned to look at Ai Cangsheng, who stared at the sky outside the hall with a calm expression.</p><p>His gaze fell.</p><p>Wei An saw the resting Evil Sin Bow.</p><p>The black-red Evil Sin Bow was surrounded by devilish energy and remnant souls, that were the powerful creatures it had killed during its waking hours.</p><p>The Holy Divine Palace came out in full force from the tiny Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>The entire Shengshen Continent was guarded by Emperor Cangsheng alone, wasn’t it?</p><p>Wei An’s eyes narrowed as if he wanted to look beyond the black cloth and see through Ai Cangsheng’s legs on the osmanthus wheelchair.</p><p>“What’s the matter?” Ai Cangsheng tilted his head and looked over indifferently.</p><p>Wei An blinked. Then, he smiled and raised his head. He asked bluntly, “How long had Emperor Cangsheng’s legs been like this? I remember that you didn’t need a wheelchair when you were one of the Ten High Nobles, right?”</p><p>“I don’t remember.”</p><p>He forgot?</p><p>How could he forget this?</p><p>However, after he pondered over it carefully, Wei An really couldn’t figure out how Ai Cangsheng could go from being one of the Ten High Nobles who shot down Guang Hanyue to sitting in a wheelchair and being immobile.</p><p>He didn’t think too much about it. He quickly skipped this matter and looked back at Dao Qiongcang. “How confident are you guys?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang smiled and did not speak.</p><p>“Just give me an accurate estimation, Hallmaster Dao. We are in this together now. I promise I won’t reveal any information to anyone.” Wei An asked.</p><p>“Even to Mu Ling?”</p><p>“Even him! Other than me, no one would know!” Wei An was really curious about how confident this mysterious Hallmaster Dao was.</p><p>“Other than you…” Dao Qiongcang’s eyes suddenly focused on him. “Can you be trusted?”</p><p>Wei An was flabbergasted. “Do you think that I’m a Saint Servant? You even suspected me? Dao Qiongcang, are you crazy?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had a solemn look and he only relaxed after a long time. It was uncertain what question he replied to as he gave a vague answer.</p><p>“Just in case.”</p><p>When the carriage returned to the Yougui Pavilion, Xu Xiaoshou dismissed</p><p>Yingying and Qiao’er and secretly passed Old Man Li a jade talisman that</p><p>allowed him to enter the Apricot Realm.</p><p>He didn’t care if Old Man Li could find it or not, he just told him to pass on the message to Bazhun’an.</p><p>“I might not be able to handle the Four Symbols Secret Realm. You have to send more people. The worst case scenario is that you have to come and support me personally.”</p><p>And this:</p><p>“It would be best if all the Saint Servants are present.”</p><p>After that, he rushed up to the third floor in front of everyone and pushed open the door to Aunt Xiang’s room .</p><p>With the Stealth technique, Xu Xiaoshou went upstairs without anyone noticing.</p><p>“And you are?”</p><p>When he pushed the door open, Xu Xiaoshou was stunned when he saw the cute girl who was dressing up in front of the mirror.</p><p>He hurriedly retreated and thought he had entered the wrong room.</p><p>However, it was not the wrong room. He had not entered the fantasy realm and was not affected by any illusion.</p><p>This girl looked like one of the two girls that Aunt Xiang had brought, but she was obviously not.</p><p>“Aunt only dressed up a little. You can’t recognize me?” The young girl turned around and covered her mouth as she chuckled and looked so pure and lovely.</p><p>“What kind of evil technique is this?” Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he had been struck by lightning. His scalp went numb.</p><p>Based on his Perception, Aunt Xiang was not covered in any human skin, nor did she use any additional spiritual weapons to enhance or disguise herself..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
