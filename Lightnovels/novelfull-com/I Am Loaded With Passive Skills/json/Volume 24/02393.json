Wonderful!</p><p>Yue Gongli hissed. He finally understood what the god slayer’s last thought was. He had known it for a long time.</p><p>Above the Black Water Stream.</p><p>When the Arrow of Evil God broke through the sky and revealed its sharp edge.</p><p>Feng Yujin noticed the insignificant light amid the brilliance that shone from everyone’s eyes.</p><p>The God -Slaying Token flew over!</p><p>“Good opportunity!”</p><p>Feng Yujin followed his initial instinct and reached out to grab it, but he was so scared that he stopped. Then he realized that he had no choice but to grab it…</p><p>The command token that was half the height of a person had already passed by him. It streaked through the Black Water Stream and shot into the Ran Ming ruins.</p><p>The second God-Slaying Token returned to its original position!</p><p>Feng Yujin’s face was as dark as ink. He turned to look at Xu Xiaoshou and gritted his teeth. “You’re really a jinx…” As soon as he finished speaking.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>The power of the Holy Emperor could no longer restrain the God-Slaying Token, that trembled even more violently. Feng Yujin chose to let it go.</p><p>The third God -Slaying Token returned to its original position!</p><p>Jin Ren saw everything.</p><p>The instant the sky of the Four Symbols Secret Realm was pierced by the Arrow of Evil God, he was shocked and activated the Moment of Enlightenment to prevent any accidents.</p><p>Nothing unexpected happened.</p><p>Or rather, it was all an accident.</p><p>He saw the Saint war on the high cliff, Wei An, Water Ghost, Cen Qiaofu, and Yue Gongli running around outside Gong Yang Mountain in a panic.</p><p>He did not choose to stop everything. The Holy Emperor Fengtian already reacted in such a sensitive way and even he could not stop it. How could he succeed?</p><p>He used his spiritual senses to explore the Apricot Realm.</p><p>The Frost Ferret was stuck at this point in time. The killing intent in its body was suppressed by the Dragon Apricot spirit and it woke up.</p><p>It was in a daze.</p><p>Jin Ren let out a long sigh and suddenly realized what Ran Ming’s last thought was-he already knew.</p><p>He still remembered what Elder Han said.</p><p>“There are three God-Slaying Tokens. The Ran Ming ruins will automatically call for the God-Slaying Tokens that wandered about outside. This would cause them to return through various methods to activate the Ran Ming ruins and unseal the inheritance.”</p><p>“When one or more God -Slaying Tokens are returned, the calling will become stronger. In the worst case, even a demi-saint would not be able to withstand it.”</p><p>Various methods.</p><p>Jin Ren was silent.</p><p>He had this thought that if the Frost Ferret, the only one who had almost collected three God-Slaying Tokens, had not lost control and entered the</p><p>Apricot Realm, would it be the only one who could ‘warn’ him in advance?</p><p>There were no ifs.</p><p>Jin Ren looked up and saw the Arrow of Evil God that was aimed at the Black Water Stream and the high cliff. His hair stood on end.</p><p>This thing could only have come from the faraway Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe!</p><p>That fellow was so far away and so strong… Were they all affected?</p><p>On the high cliff. “Water Ghost!”</p><p>‘Wei An!”</p><p>As they faced the Arrow of Evil God, the two demi-saints stood side by side as if they were both intimate and trusted comrades. They held each other’s sleeves tightly.</p><p>“Don’t even think about running!”</p><p>“You too!”</p><p>Under the power of the evil god.</p><p>A light shield emblem lit up on Saint Guardian Wei An’s chest.</p><p>Water Ghost shifted and the Power Upanishad Formation appeared under his feet.</p><p>The two of them faced the Arrow of Evil God and flew into the sky angrily as they tried to challenge it head-on! However, just as they took off…</p><p>“Ouch.”</p><p>The two demi-saints fell downward without a care for their image and created two deep pits as they smashed into the cliff.</p><p>“Weng…”</p><p>A vast nameless power rose from the bottom of the Black Water Stream.</p><p>The Arrow of Evil God suddenly stopped in its flight. In the next moment, a divine light emerged from the Black Water Stream and shot into the sky.</p><p>Jin Ren’s legs exploded on the spot, and he fell into the black water.</p><p>Feng Yujin’s head resisted with all his might, but his hair seemed to want to pull his head down.</p><p>The two Saints on the cliff could barely raise their upper bodies.</p><p>With a bang, their heads were smashed into the ground by the heavy pressure, and their mouths were filled with mud.</p><p>At the same time, everyone in the Four Symbols Secret Realm crashed to the</p><p>ground, either on their knees or they fell… Their heights seemed to have been reduced.</p><p>It was as if everything was about to welcome true nobility!</p><p>The divine light shot into the sky and transformed into the phantom of a giant axe.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>The axe slashed down lightly.</p><p>The Arrow of Evil God that was imbued with the power of the ancestral source, resembled a piece of fragile paper in the world. It was split in half by the axe blade from the tip of the arrow to the tail of the sword.</p><p>The power of the evil god, the power of evil sin, the Holy Power…</p><p>All these powers were nothing in the face of the God -Slaying power.</p><p>Even the pollution within was completely purified when it was slashed into pieces. It turned into dazzling starlight that scattered all over the sky and was finally absorbed by the Ran Ming ruins.</p><p>The world was beautiful!</p><p>The heavy pressure disappeared. Everyone looked up at the same time at the Nine Heavens and saw the descent of the Galaxy.</p><p>An extremely solemn and sacred giant phantom dressed in a golden robe studded with starlight and a crown on his head raised his head calmly behind the Galaxy. His face was blurry.</p><p>Not only did the people in the Four Symbols Secret Realm see it.</p><p>Everyone in the five regions of the Shengshen Continent saw it too when they looked up.</p><p>He raised his sleeves and gently waved his hand. A huge command token was thrown out and turned into a scroll made of starlight. It slowly unfolded in the sky of the Shengshen Continent and in the minds of everyone in the world.</p><p>What was written on it:</p><p>“Praise my true name and lead to reincarnation.”</p><p>“The divine priest governs life, and all living beings are equal..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
