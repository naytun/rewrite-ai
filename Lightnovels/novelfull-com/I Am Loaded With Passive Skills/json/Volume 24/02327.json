Could it be that someone from the Infernal Lineage is acting independently?” Xi pondered while holding a portrait.</p><p>The portrait depicted a girl carrying a large cauldron, both adorable and peculiar.</p><p>At first glance, it seemed to be Hua Ying from the Holy Palace.</p><p>However, through the three-legged bathtub, it could be confirmed that this was the alchemy cauldron “Auspicious Dragon and Phoenix” of the Sleeveless Saint Servant, and this person was Xu Xiaoshou in disguise.</p><p>Unfortunately, during that incident in Yunlun, no one noticed these details.</p><p>“So, this is my opponent this time…”</p><p>Xi deeply admired Xu Xiaoshou from the bottom of his heart but was also eager for the challenge.</p><p>The stronger the enemy, the more excited he became.</p><p>“Drip. ”</p><p>The Heavenly Group’s exclusive battle communicator connected, and Xi established a direct line to Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao, the public opinion in Jade Capital City and various regions…” “I am aware, but so soon, even the Transformation Division couldn’t suppress</p><p>“Yes,” Xi responded seriously, without any embarrassment. This demonstrated the strength of the enemy, and underestimating it would lead to consequences sooner or later.</p><p>“You reported in a timely manner, worthy of praise.”</p><p>“So, how should we deal with it? Please instruct, Hallmaster Dao.</p><p>“No need to be so reserved, young one.”</p><p>“Alright, Hallmaster Dao.”</p><p>“You don’t need to do anything.”</p><p>“Alright, Hall… Huh? Hallmaster Dao, what did you say?”</p><p>“I don’t like repeating myself. From now on, all orders will be the same.”</p><p>“Yes, Hallmaster Dao, but may I ask why? We can continue to fight. We mustn’t give up.”</p><p>“Your curiosity is indeed strong. However, the inaction of the Transformation Division does not mean we are giving up. Heavenly Group has more than just the Transformation Division. The Saint Servant don’t hold the reins of the Shengshen Continent.”</p><p>“Understood, Hallmaster Dao. But I still want to ask…”</p><p>“Wait. ”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang didn’t explain further and ended the communication.</p><p>Xi hesitated for a moment but chose to believe and raised his hand to signal everyone, “Cease all public opinion suppression regarding He Ting Mountain and Ran Ming Ruins.”</p><p>“Ah?” Voices of confusion immediately came from his subordinates. “Why?”</p><p>Xi remained expressionless, turned, and looked outside the dim room, gazing at the azure sky.</p><p>“This is not Sky City; Saint Servant can’t stir up much trouble here in Jade Capital City.” “The sky of Jade Capital City belongs to Dao!”</p><p>“Dao Xuanji?”</p><p>Inside Yougui Pavilion, Xu Xiaoshou held a jade scroll in his hand, looking at the drifting snow outside the window, lost in thought.</p><p>Leaning against the window, he maintained this stiff posture for quite a long time.</p><p>None of the new Six Divisions posed any threat to him. They were inconsequential.</p><p>Except for the unexpected appearance of Yu Zhiwen, the rest were not important.</p><p>After all, he didn’t know any of them.</p><p>They were probably just passersby that could be defeated with a single move.</p><p>Based on the combat strength of the previous Six Divisions, Xu Xiaoshou might have been cautious during his time in Dongtianwang City.</p><p>But after the Abyss Island, Xu Xiaoshou, who had gone through a series of enhancements, was fearless.</p><p>He didn’t care about opponents who were not at least demi-saints.</p><p>Of course, he still had to remain vigilant.</p><p>The only variable in the new Six Divisions was not the divisions themselves but the “chess” played by Dao Qiongcang. Maybe it could have some unexpected effects? Maybe it could work wonders?</p><p>He had no idea.</p><p>What Xu Xiaoshou truly cared about was the conspicuous three characters—”Dao Xuanji.”</p><p>If he remembered correctly, this person was the mastermind behind the downfall of the Lei family, and now, he had become one of the Three Emperors.</p><p>“Surnamed Dao…”</p><p>“Inhumane and unscrupulous…”</p><p>“This is much more terrifying than Yan Wuse!”</p><p>“Yan Wuse even used the entire Abyss Island, step by step, almost devouring everything until he realized it too late and was truly killed.”</p><p>“Dao Xuanji, how should I deal with him?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt troubled. He immediately thought of his little junior sister and grabbed Elder Han.</p><p>“Where is your Aunt Mu? Why haven’t I seen her?”</p><p>“She, she, she…” Little Frost Ferret stuttered.</p><p>“How dare she make you lie to me?” Xu Xiaoshou glared, “Would you dare to lie to me?”</p><p>Little Frost Ferret’s eyes suddenly became frightened, as if saying, ‘How could you have mind-reading skills?’ and hurriedly said, “She should have gone to find that orange-faced man of Yama. That’s what Lord Bazhun’an told me to tell you.”</p><p>Bazhun’an?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou calmed down a bit.</p><p>Bazhun’an also knew about this matter and didn’t stop it, so it shouldn’t be too dangerous.</p><p>The orange-faced man could only be Five Decays of Heaven and Man. Did Lei Xi’er really go to find him because of what he said at that time?</p><p>Damn! He should have pulled out the tongue of Five Decays of Heaven and Man at that time or let the Water Ghost kill him, instead of pleading for him…</p><p>No! It was also because of that darn Heavenly Ancestor Legacy, wasting his precious time, or else Lei Xi’er wouldn’t have dared to run far…</p><p>Thinking too much was useless.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head to clear his mind. He only wanted to know how Lei Xi’er reacted when she learned this information.</p><p>With her intelligence, as long as she didn’t degenerate into Mu Zixi, she shouldn’t act recklessly.</p><p>But the vendetta of annihilating a clan…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou squinted his eyes, recalling the assurance Five Decays of Heaven and Man gave Lei Xi’er during the Abyss Island incident:</p><p>“If you’re in trouble, just call my name… Five Decays of Heaven and Man!”</p><p>Did she call him?</p><p>Could Xu Xiaoshou call him?</p><p>“Five Decays of Heaven and Man!” “Five Decays of Heaven and Man!”</p><p>“My dear Five Decays of Heaven and Man-</p><p>“Damn Five Decays of Heaven and Man, come out!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou never gave up easily, so he shouted “Five Decays of Heaven and Man” in various ways in his room.</p><p>Calling out the name of the Saint was a great disrespect, but it was also a clever way to reach out.</p><p>No matter what, Xu Xiaoshou and Five Decays of Heaven and Man shared a bond forged in life and death, and he still held a shred of trust in it.</p><p>Instead of letting Lei Xi’er wander around with this incarnate of disaster and meet an untimely demise, it was better to take advantage of the strong winds in Jade Capital City and bring this plague into the fold.</p><p>First, this would prevent Lei Xi’er from running too far.</p><p>Second, with the constitution of this Plague, just having him in Jade Capital City would cause Dao Qiongcang a headache with the increasing number of troubles.</p><p>With these thoughts in mind, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes brightened, and the shouts of “Five Decays of Heaven and Man” grew louder.</p><p>Before long, with a creak, the door was pushed open..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
