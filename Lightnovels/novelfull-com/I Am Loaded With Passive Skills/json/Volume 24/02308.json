They quickly followed him.</p><p>“Young Master.”</p><p>After that, they helped the sick young master into the carriage.</p><p>Qiao’er tilted her head, as if she had received a telepathic communication. She stood beside the carriage and glanced at Old Man Li. After a moment of hesitation, she lowered her voice and said, “Ghostface from the Ghost God gang requested an audience.”</p><p>“Let him wait!” Xu Xiaoshou waved his fan and was too lazy to get out of the carriage.</p><p>A noble young master should have the attitude of a noble young master.</p><p>The Ghost God gang were here to apologize. How could he not milk it for all it was worth? Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to get much profit in the future.</p><p>Although Xu Xiaoshou also coveted the Eight Doors and Seven Constellations, he understood the pros and cons about sending himself to the door to be slaughtered and passively waiting for someone to come and give him gifts. “You two, get on quickly. Old Man Li is waiting to drive off in the carriage.”</p><p>Old Man Li then invited the two women to get on the carriage. As he drove the carriage, he sighed with emotion. “Young Master, Ghostface was the big guy yesterday? He’s a big shot in Jade Capital City’s underworld!”</p><p>Qiao’er’s beautiful eyes were filled with anger.</p><p>Why did this coachman not know his place and still dared to blabber on?</p><p>She pressed the Soundproof Barrier button on the carriage and tried to isolate it from the outside so that she could have a good chat with Young Master Xu.</p><p>In the end, she discovered that the Soundproof Barrier in the osmanthus carriage was out of order!</p><p>Qiao’er almost lost her temper.</p><p>At this moment, the sickly young master laughed. His manner was gentle and refined. He asked shamelessly, “You know everything about Ghostface. How much do you know about the Ghost God Gang? Tell me, too.”</p><p>Qiao’er could only endure it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou then tapped his fingers and the Soundproof Barrier in the carriage that he had damaged was restored.</p><p>Those insignificant figures had their own channels.</p><p>Just based on the fact that Old Man Li was able to talk about the new Seven Sword Deity yesterday meant that he was definitely of some use.</p><p>As for people like Yingying and Qiao’er, they spent most of their time in the Exotic Pavilion, their contacts were usually people who had some status.</p><p>The way they obtained information was completely different from Old Man Li’s.</p><p>Furthermore, with Aunt Xiang’s power, they might only get what Aunt Xiang allowed them to know.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou trusted Aunt Xiang.</p><p>However, he was not used to receiving information from a single source.</p><p>In this huge Jade Capital City, who could guarantee that Aunt Xiang, the sister-in-law of the Ghost God gang only knew what Dao Qiongcang wanted her to know?</p><p>“Where is Young Master going?” Old Man Li drove the carriage to the main street and asked a question instead of answering.</p><p>“Three Incenses.”</p><p>Old Man Li paused for a moment, then turned the carriage around and did not ask any more questions.</p><p>Yingying and Qiao’er thought that the Three Incenses was some kind of well-known place. When they finally realized what it was, their expressions changed drastically.</p><p>“Young Master wants to go to the Three Incenses?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“It’s that…”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>The two women suddenly felt as if their chests had constricted and they choked so hard that they could not speak.</p><p>If Young Master Xu wasn’t joking, or if he didn’t get the name wrong.</p><p>There was only one Three Incenses in the Jade Capital City – the Saint Killer Hall!</p><p>However, that was the current ruler of the Dark World.</p><p>How could anyone go there so openly? Don’t you need to be in disguise?</p><p>Also, although everyone suspected that the Three Incenses had the backing of the Holy Divine Palace, the Holy Divine Palace did not admit it openly.</p><p>Therefore, this place was not a place that one could go as they wished. If they were caught by the Holy Divine Guards, it was considered a great crime.</p><p>Most importantly…</p><p>Why would Xu Gusheng want to go to that place?</p><p>Old Man Li actually knew the way?</p><p>“Is there a problem?” The sickly young master fanned himself and glanced at the two women.</p><p>He came to do some fishing today. The bait was himself, and the fish were all the big shots inside and outside the Jade Capital City.</p><p>He wanted to find out if Dao Qiongcang had seen Xu Gusheng and if the others had recognized Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>How would they respond?</p><p>And all of this was directly related to how the Four Symbols Secret Realm should act next.</p><p>Yingying and Qiao’er didn’t know that much, but after they glanced at each other, they suddenly understood.</p><p>There didn’t seem to be much of a problem?</p><p>The sickly young master in front of them only looked weak and seemed on the verge of death. However, he was an important figure who received Aunt Xiang’s personal attention.</p><p>It didn’t seem like a big deal for him to go to the Three Incenses. With his wealth, he might even be a regular customer of the Three Incenses and the employer of the assassins there!</p><p>“How strange…”</p><p>Both Yingying and Qiao’er felt the same way at the same time.</p><p>They already knew that Xu Gusheng was very powerful, but somehow they subconsciously forgot about all his achievements.</p><p>It was as if this person was really just an ordinary person.</p><p>When he looked away, his presence was so weak that it was as if there were only two people in the carriage.</p><p>Returning to simplicity?</p><p>Yingying and Qiao’er didn’t understand, but they felt that it was very powerful.</p><p>As the carriage drove on its way, Old Man Li began to chatter.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, it’s not that I’m the one who’s giving the orders, but if you ask me, the only ones who can really make it in the underworld of Jade Capital City are the Three Incenses and the Ghost God gang. The others simply can’t make it on the list.”</p><p>“But this doesn’t include the two major forces, the Dark Division and the</p><p>Transformation Division. If these two enter, the others will have to give in and that includes the two big Buddhas mentioned earlier.”</p><p>Yingying and Qiao’er remained silent.</p><p>In their eyes, the influence of the Yougui Pavilion was actually very great.</p><p>However, since Old Man Li’s conversation was of interest to Young Master Xu, there was nothing much to say.</p><p>“You know a lot.” Xu Xiaoshou gently fanned himself. “I heard that the Holy</p><p>Divine Palace is behind the Three Incenses. What do you think?”</p><p>“That is obvious. How can there be any filth under the feet of the Son of</p><p>Heaven? That’s why no one would believe that they’re clean and black.”</p><p>“A vulgar opinion.” Qiao’er couldn’t help but mutter. She didn’t have much evidence to refute. She simply thought that the words of a coachman weren’t very credible..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
