Instead, he used it as a base for his descent, delving deeper underground.</p><p>The mission was paramount.</p><p>He couldn’t gauge how deep he had ventured. Each time Elder Han called for a halt, he paused to focus his Perception.</p><p>Yet, there was no trace of the Holy Emperor, Qilin.</p><p>“At the time, I merely stumbled upon it by chance, my consciousness brushing against a “ripple” or “wave” of sorts.”</p><p>“Out of curiosity, I attempted to sense it and I dared not be curious again.</p><p>Fortunately, it paid me no mind, and I survived.”</p><p>“Lord Shou, perhaps you need to use your consciousness…”</p><p>Transformed into its smaller form, Little Frost Ferret nervously rubbed its paws before the spatial image in the Apricot Realm.</p><p>Would Lord Shou blame it if Qilin wasn’t found?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paused at what seemed to be the most likely spot to connect with Qilin, pondering. Then, he looked up.</p><p>Having deciphered Yu Zhiwen’s astrolabe, he knew well that in these depths, they had long surpassed the range of detection.</p><p>He released the Vanishing Technique.</p><p>Within the Apricot Realm, Little Frost Ferret watched anxiously as Lord Shou abruptly appeared in the spatial image, its paws clenched nervously.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paid it no mind, focusing instead on initiating the first style of the Three Streams of Red Plum Blossoms, the Falling Flower World, allowing his consciousness to materialize.</p><p>Yet the search yielded nothing.</p><p>He still couldn’t sense the “wave” or “ripple” Elder Han spoke of. “Senior Qilin, please refrain from killing me for now.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t despair; instead, he offered a friendly smile.</p><p>With a jolt, the earth parted, creating a solid space:</p><p>“I know Senior Qilin can see me and discern my goodwill.”</p><p>“I’m sure you can guess my intentions, so there’s no need to hide.”</p><p>“I believe, regardless, that my sincerity warrants a meeting. Please grant me an audience.”</p><p>“Not for anything else, but as a moment of interaction after countless millennia of solitude—in the vast expanse of life, this is nothing short of interesting.”</p><p>Inside the Apricot Realm, Little Frost Ferret waited silently.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waited too.</p><p>But even after his speech, the elusive “wave” or “ripple” remained undetectable.</p><p>“I’ve brought some wine from our kind.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou brought forth a jug of fine wine from the Yougui Pavilion, the Early Spring of the Mule Deer lingering vividly in his mind, its flavor still resonating in his memory</p><p>In the darkness underground, silence reigned, and there was still no response. “And dragon’s blood, which may pique your interest even more.”</p><p>Without hesitation, Xu Xiaoshou stole a bucketful of the Holy Emperor-grade dragon’s blood, currently in possession of Dragon Apricot.</p><p>In an instant, ripples appeared in the Falling Flower World, where consciousness could be made tangible.</p><p>“A wave!”</p><p>“It’s that wave!”</p><p>Inside the Apricot Realm, Little Frost Ferret squeaked ecstatically, bouncing with joy and clapping its paws, its excitement palpable.</p><p>There might be a chance… Xu Xiaoshou realized the allure of Holy Emperor-grade dragon’s blood to these ancient creatures was irresistibly strong. Was that all it took for them to give in to temptation?</p><p>But before he could grasp or communicate with it, the ripple vanished. He couldn’t even trace its fleeting presence.</p><p>“Three buckets!”</p><p>With a sweep of his hand, Xu Xiaoshou produced three more buckets of dragon blood.</p><p>Inside the Apricot Realm, the Dragon Apricot suddenly convulsed, its canopy blooming to shield all the blood that belonged to it, denying any opportunity for theft.</p><p>Little Frost Ferret trembled with fear, not daring to speak, relieved that the Dragon Apricot didn’t unleash its wrath upon it.</p><p>Yet, despite the temptation of three buckets of dragon’s blood, the elusive</p><p>“wave” did not appear.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath, then tried to persuade once more:</p><p>“Senior, there’s no need to suppress yourself.”</p><p>“We humans have a saying, ‘Sip the wine while it’s here, for today’s joy may be tomorrow’s memory.’ It means we should seize the moment for enjoyment.” “I’ll leave this dragon’s blood here, whether you choose to meet me or not.” Xu Xiaoshou adopted a humble stance.</p><p>He thought to himself, with such sincerity on his part, Qilin should at least show some respect and meet him.</p><p>But there was still no response.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a hint of anger rising within him.</p><p>This Qilin was truly insolent. Did it refuse to accept a toast for a penalty sip?</p><p>Yet, he didn’t show his displeasure. Instead, he wore a look of realization.</p><p>—Since Qilin remained silent, then whatever he said would be the truth, wouldn’t it?</p><p>“So, Senior, you wish to test me?”</p><p>“Very well, I do have a trick up my sleeve. Whether you wish to meet me or not,</p><p>I can see you.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his gaze, his confidence hidden deep within.</p><p>Inside the Apricot Realm, Little Frost Ferret stared intently at the screen, unsure if Lord Shou was bluffing or truly possessed such formidable skills.</p><p>Inexplicably, it felt a sense of foreboding.</p><p>“If you won’t speak, I’ll take it as your consent!”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Xu Xiaoshou made the Frost Ferret drop out of hiding.</p><p>“Squeak—”</p><p>Emerging from behind the scenes to the forefront, Little Frost Ferret jumped in shock..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
