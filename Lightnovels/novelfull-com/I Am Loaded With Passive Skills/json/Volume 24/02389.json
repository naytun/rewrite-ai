Now that the old and new hatred had erupted, how could she let him go?</p><p>“Requesting backup! ”</p><p>After the message was sent in the Heavenly Group’s channel, the coffin-like sword case opened without waiting for a reply.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>An astonishing Sword Will erupted and a dazzling golden light bloomed from the sword case.</p><p>Beibei’s chubby cheeks quivered when the sword energy swept past her. Her white clothes were dyed golden, and even the stains on her clothes that had been soaked in the water, turned pale yellow. At this moment, it looked very regal.</p><p>In an instant, her temperament completely changed. She was like a queen that wore an intangible crown. Her eyes were no longer lively and cute, but had a ruthless and indifferent look.</p><p>“Supreme Emperor Sword!”</p><p>With a clang, the sound of sword cries rang out.</p><p>Black fog rolled up between the cliffs and crept onto the ground.</p><p>The Black Water Stream trembled in fear.</p><p>A streak of golden light shot into the sky and absorbed the essence of Heaven and Earth. It turned into the illusory shadow of an emperor and fused into Beibei’s soul.</p><p>At the same time, the phantom of a sword that towered over her appeared behind Beibei.</p><p>She slowly reached out to her shoulder and held it gently.</p><p>“Buzz! ”</p><p>The Sword Will from all directions trembled, and the long sword finally solidified and showed its first signs of dominance.</p><p>This sword was unusually long, with a black hilt and golden patterns on the sword frame. A pair of angry dragon eyes was carved onto it that showed its solemnity and majesty.</p><p>The sword body had eight sides and was thicker than a regular sword. Apart from the dark silver color of the two blades, there were black golden dragon patterns on the four sides in the middle. It had the nobility of an emperor, but it also had a terrifying killing intent.</p><p>Beibei held the Supreme Emperor Sword in her hand, and there was a regal look in her eyes. It was as if she had the power to control everyone’s lives in this world.</p><p>She could only pull out the Supreme Emperor Sword and twirl it in the air. Then, she grasped the hilt of the sword with both hands and held it in front of her.</p><p>“Mortal, kneel!”</p><p>As soon as Feng Yujin broke through the Black Water Stream, he saw that there was someone waiting. He subconsciously wanted to grab Beibei, but he broke out in a cold sweat and immediately said.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, take her down. Use the second option as soon as possible!” Rebellion, rebellion, rebellion, rebellion…</p><p>Along the way, Jin Ren kept muttering these two words. He felt as though he could no longer recognize these two words.</p><p>He looked at Beibei, and the image of the girl being humiliated by his portrait clone flashed across his mind. He wanted to laugh at her.</p><p>Who knew that the girl who looked ridiculous before suddenly patted the sword case and underwent a splendid transformation. Her eyes were so cold, it was as if she had changed into another person.</p><p>A single sentence, ‘Mortal, kneel!’ uttered in the Emperor’s voice rolled out like thunder.</p><p>The golden and noble Sword Will spread out like a tide. The entire Black Water Stream trembled, and all the plants and rocks bowed their heads.</p><p>Feng Yujin’s knees almost gave way as he looked up in disbelief.</p><p>Mortal…mortal?</p><p>In this world, if he was a mortal, who would dare to call himself an Emperor?</p><p>He realized that the thing that made him shudder was not Beibei, but the sword in her hand.</p><p>Supreme Emperor Sword?</p><p>What kind of sword was this? Where had he heard of it before?</p><p>The Holy Emperor Fengtian was like this, but he was like Jin Ren who had received a second true body. This was even worse.</p><p>After he muttered the word ‘rebellion’, he closed his lips tightly and did not dare to mock him. However, before he could even achieve this, his second thought, Soul Reading, had just appeared.</p><p>The Supreme Emperor Sword’s aura alone was enough to suffocate him, and he almost fell into the water like a bird whose wings were broken.</p><p>Beibei, who held the Emperor Sword, had merely pressed it down.</p><p>The one who mastered the Absolute Imperial Control, the first realm of the Ten Thousand Sword Technique, was more terrifying than any ancient swordsman in Jin Ren’s memory!</p><p>“What the hell?”</p><p>“Is this still that silly and sweet girl?”</p><p>Jin Ren’s mind went blank for a moment.</p><p>He could tell at a glance that Beibei’s compatibility with the Supreme Emperor Sword was not something that Rao Yaoyao with the Cang Godhood Sword, or Mei Siren with the Taicheng Sword, could compare to.</p><p>The former was not worthy at all, and the latter just kept it safe on his behalf.</p><p>This must be the relationship between Xu Xiaoshou and Hidden Bitter- from childhood to adulthood!</p><p>NO!</p><p>This was not accurate enough.</p><p>Hidden Bitter was not that strong at all.</p><p>Or should I say, the relationship between the young Bazhun’an and the Qingju Sword, after he became famous and before the sword broke?</p><p>“Are you kidding me, Feng Yujin…”</p><p>As Jin Ren spoke, he raised his eyebrows and Sword Will shot out from his eyes.</p><p>It was only when his sword cognition and the imposing manner of the Swallow the Mountains and Rivers appeared that he was able to overcome the pressure of the Supreme Emperor Sword.</p><p>He flipped his hand and pulled out a grade three spiritual sword that had the best quality in his entire body.</p><p>“Woo…”</p><p>The spiritual sword withered.</p><p>Under the pressure of the emperor of swords, it was like a peasant who did not dare to raise its eyes. The sword body even bowed to show its submission.</p><p>Jin Ren fell silent.</p><p>Without Hidden Bitter, he would probably be crushed to death by the Supreme Emperor Sword, even if he was good at resisting.</p><p>There should only be two weapons that could resist this eight-sided sword.</p><p>Only Flame Python and Fourth Sword, but they were all with the main body.</p><p>The power of the Heavenly Ancestor and the power of the Dragon Ancestor could also resist the Supreme Emperor Sword, but the second true body did not have it.</p><p>The Penetrating Divine Senses was enough.</p><p>His sword cognition could definitely fight it, after all, it came from Bazhun’an.</p><p>However, the power of the sword cognition could not be inherited. It could only be cultivated in a short period of time after the birth of the second true body. Moreover, where was the carrier of the sword cognition?</p><p>What would he use to fight?</p><p>10 Sections of the Finger Sword?</p><p>Against others, Jin Ren was confident that he could use the Sharpness of the Holy Emperor Lv.o to turn into a Sword Human and chop them up like a madman.</p><p>However, he wasn’t stupid enough to use his body to clash head-on with the Five Great Divine Instruments of Chaos. Moreover, the sword bearer was a pure ancient swordsman, Beibei, who had just taken over Gou Wuyue’s position.</p><p>This was a choice that only a fool would make!</p><p>Jin Ren tilted his head and looked at Feng Yujin speechlessly.</p><p>“I might be able to take her down as soon as possible, but it will take at least a day.. Can you afford to wait?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
