Congratulations, you managed to hit me once. This dragon blood is your reward.”</p><p>The eyelids of the Dragon Apricot Spirit trembled violently.</p><p>It looked at the unruly figure’s departing back and felt like a cat that had been teased with a cat stick by its owner for Ten Auras. Its euphoria disappeared in an instant.</p><p>What had happened just now…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had returned to his lucky seat that was actually a random patch of grass, stared at the sky in a daze for three seconds. Then, he sighed with melancholy.</p><p>“I’m invincible again.”</p><p>With the Moment of Enlightenment, even the ancestral tree Dragon Apricot could be toyed with!</p><p>In fact, there was no need for any verification. Xu Xiaoshou could make a judgment based on his battle consciousness that it was close to the third realm.</p><p>After he was in the Moment of Enlightenment state, he didn’t know if he was at the peak of the third realm, but he definitely had complete battle consciousness at the third realm.</p><p>This was only the enhancement of his battle consciousness.</p><p>His speed, reaction, calculation ability, and so on had all been raised to the level of a god.</p><p>“The only problem now was that it would not maintain its state for a long period of time and you still need to click on it.”</p><p>“Moreover, if we encounter someone like The Divine, the question lies in whether the Moment of Enlightenment could be activated.”</p><p>“But it’s basically fine. I’ll practice the use of the Moment of Enlightenment. Once I’m familiar with it, my battle consciousness will definitely be able to break through to the third realm.”</p><p>“At that time, the problem of not being able to activate the second awakening skill will no longer be a problem.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clenched his fists and skipped the exciting part of the experiment. He looked at the last awakening skill.</p><p>“Limit…”</p><p>Halfway through his excited assessment, Xu Xiaoshou sensed that something seemed amiss.</p><p>It seemed that this item needed to be stacked on top of the Berserk Giant?</p><p>“That’s a little abnormal…”</p><p>“Don’t tell me I’m going to die due to my limitation?”</p><p>As he frowned, the golden light shone brightly. Xu Xiaoshou then turned into the Berserk Giant.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer could no longer sleep. It stared at the human kid from afar.</p><p>It realized that Xu Xiaoshou had made a qualitative breakthrough after the saint calamity thunder.</p><p>Now, he had transformed into that Golden Giant again. It did not know what he was up to.</p><p>“Ultimate Giant… Roar!”</p><p>Before his thoughts even stopped, a heart-stopping roar suddenly erupted from the Golden Giant.</p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p>The space exploded in that area.</p><p>Terrifying endless tidal waves that contained destructive aura surged over amidst the rumbling sounds!</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit’s pearl like eyes trembled.</p><p>The power of the ancestral tree spread out, and a layer of golden light protected the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>However, that was all it could do in such a short period of time. It could not take care of anything else.</p><p>Hence, the other places in the Apricot Realm were in chaos.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit originally circled around the 100,000 alchemy cauldrons, but with a rumble, all 100,000 alchemy cauldrons shattered.</p><p>Its small body flew through the air, and it was so frightened that it sucked in a breath of cold air. It swallowed all the elixirs after the cauldron explosion and the destructive aura that had tried to destroy it. Then it stared dazedly at its owner.</p><p>“Meow?”</p><p>What happened?</p><p>The broken tower exploded…</p><p>The poisonous fish pond exploded…</p><p>The poisonous vines on the ground were all ripped off and blown away…</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit’s eyesight was sharp. It could actually see a tall flame giant, an ice-blue giant, and a dragon corpse being blown away by the fluctuations in the distance.</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>A dragon corpse?</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit hurriedly moved to protect this big treasure. Who would have thought that in the blink of an eye…</p><p>The sky suddenly darkened!</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit looked up in shock.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit also looked up in a daze.</p><p>In the sky, there was a huge, scarlet eyeball that was filled with a violent aura as it stared at the human world!</p><p>“Roar…” The Dragon Apricot Spirit was startled.</p><p>As it spread its saint’s will, it discovered that there was actually a golden head in the sky, and that eye was just one of the eyes on the head.</p><p>The golden head was connected to the golden giant behind the black hole.</p><p>Giant?</p><p>Wasn’t this the human kid?</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit was all too familiar with the golden giant. Just now, this thing had even hugged and kissed it wildly.</p><p>But now, it seemed to be a huge golden giant that was tens of thousands of feet in size. It was fundamentally different from the small giant from before.</p><p>The golden light on its body was no longer just an illusion of light. Instead, it condensed and compressed into a crystal-like entity that was dark golden in color.</p><p>It encompassed his whole body!</p><p>Even the head that looked down from the sky looked like it wore a golden, hard, and huge mask!</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The Ultimate Giant roared.</p><p>With a rumble, the Order of the Great Path of the Apricot Realm was revealed and shattered. The surrounding tens of thousands of miles were swept into a vacuum by the power of this roar.</p><p>A huge golden fist that seemed like it could destroy the world descended mercilessly from the sky.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had lost his mind!</p><p>At this point, the Dragon Apricot Spirit finally determined this terrifying tact.</p><p>This human brat had finally cultivated himself to the point of cultivation deviation. He had indeed reached this step!</p><p>“Wake up!”</p><p>“Human!!”</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit let out a dragon roar that contained a trace of the power of the ancestral source.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The fist froze in mid-air for a moment, but it did not land.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit knew that it was not due to its shout that the giant stopped. It stopped temporarily due to insufficient energy.</p><p>“Whoosh.”</p><p>After a loud sound, the Ultimate Giant’s jaw fell open, and an unconscious figure dropped out and crashed into the distant mountain with a bang.</p><p>However, the golden Ultimate Giant’s ‘armor’ did not disappear. It remained in the sky, its eyes still filled with rage as it punched the ground.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>The heat waves rolled out and the world shook.</p><p>The Dragon Apricot Spirit looked at the ruined Apricot Realm and fell silent.</p><p>With just one transformation and before his fist landed, this giant had shattered half of the Apricot Realm?</p><p>Was Xu Xiaoshou the reincarnation of the Heavenly Ancestor?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
