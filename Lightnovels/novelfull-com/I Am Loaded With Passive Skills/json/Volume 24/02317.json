That is really a lot. It exceeded my expectations.” Xu Xiaoshou was secretly speechless. He did not reveal what was on his mind and his face remained calm.</p><p>“Thirty-two people. How many gold hunting token killers are each of you responsible for?” This was the information received from the Soul Reading.</p><p>+(Cursed. Passive Points+)+l.”</p><p>“I won’t hide it from Director Zhou. I know Elder Xie. He recommended that I look for you.”</p><p>“Elder Xie?”</p><p>Director Zhou was moved.</p><p>This was one of the killers he was responsible for. It was a one-way contact, and outsiders could not have any knowledge of this.</p><p>“Where is Elder Xie now? I haven’t seen him for a long time…”</p><p>“He’s dead.”</p><p>The sickly young master sneered and Director Zhou’s voice froze.</p><p>He had already guessed this outcome.</p><p>That person could even kill Rao Yaoyao. Wasn’t the killer who accepted the Black Gold Bounty merely seeking his own death?</p><p>“Director Zhou seems to be very interested in Elder Xie’s death?” The sickly young master saw that the room had gone quiet for a long time and suddenly spoke.</p><p>“No, no, no!” Director Zhou was shocked. “Young Master Xu, don’t get me wrong. I’m not interested at all. If you wish to continue, I’ll really have to find someone else to entertain you.”</p><p>“You have yet to answer the question just now. The thirty-two directors are each responsible for…”</p><p>“Young Master Xu, please don’t make things difficult for me!” Director Zhou looked worried. “I really can’t tell you.”</p><p>The sickly young master leaned back and crossed his legs. He stared at the person in front of him for a long time with a smile on his face.</p><p>“Director Zhou, do you think this is a discussion?”</p><p>Director Zhou’s heart skipped a beat, and his thoughts short-circuited for a moment.</p><p>Was he crazy?</p><p>He still wants to kill me?</p><p>I’ve never offended him…</p><p>“Three!”</p><p>Director Zhou wiped the cold sweat off his forehead. “Usually, there are only 12 directors like me. They move around in the dark and in the light. They have no more than three gold hunting token killers under them. Some of them don’t even have any.”</p><p>“There are more than thirty gold hunting token killers…” Xu Xiaoshou was a little surprised. “I heard that the number of top killers in the Three Incenses is far more than this.’</p><p>“Young Master, you must be joking. Not counting those guys who live in seclusion, it’s already good if there are more than ten gold hunting token killers in the Central Region’s Dark World.”</p><p>“Over ten people…”</p><p>The sickly young master muttered and lowered his head. Director Zhou felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p>What did this person mean?</p><p>After he entered the room, he did not give him a chance to speak; he did all the questioning.</p><p>Why are you asking so many questions?</p><p>After he figured out the structure of the Three Incenses, he would get his guard to kill everyone?</p><p>Nonsense!</p><p>“You won’t lose your job as a director if you talk so much, right?” The sickly young master raised his eyes teasingly without any show of worry at all.</p><p>“Hehe, Young Master must be joking. My life is more important than the mission.” Director Zhou understood that he definitely couldn’t afford to offend this man.</p><p>“Then tell me more!” Xu Xiaoshou’s ability to take advantage of the situation had reached perfection. “I heard that the Three Incenses is backed by the Holy Divine Palace. Who do you rely on?”</p><p>Director Zhou’s vision went black and he almost slammed the door and left the room.</p><p>“Can’t say?”</p><p>“You can tell me?”</p><p>“You really can’t tell me?”</p><p>“Young Master Xu, don’t force it…”</p><p>“Jin Ren.”</p><p>“Dark Division!”</p><p>Director Zhou almost jumped up. He said in a panic. “The Three Incenses is backed by the Dark Division. The highest source of information can lead to the Transformation Division. I really don’t know anything else!”</p><p>“You don’t know anything else? Tell me more.”</p><p>“I…” Director Zhou almost cried. “I really don’t know!”</p><p>“If you don’t know anything, what use would you be to me?”</p><p>“It’s not like that…” Director Zhou fell to the ground, his lips pale.</p><p>“Your acting is pretty good. I’ll give you three breaths of time to perform.” “Three, two, one, you can say it.”</p><p>Director Zhou raised his head in annoyance, shame and anger. At this moment, there was a hint of coldness in his eyes.</p><p>Pa.</p><p>The sickly young master tapped the paper fan in his palm. His eyes were filled with joy as he said very seriously, “You wanted to kill me just now! I didn’t get it wrong!”</p><p>Director Zhou saw the crazy look in his eyes, and the coldness turned into a cold war for no reason. “Young Master Xu, I would not dare…”</p><p>“So you’re not going to tell me and you choose to die?” Xu Xiaoshou was unreasonable. To deal with such people, one had to be tough from the beginning to the end.</p><p>Director Zhou’s lips trembled as he said, “I can’t tell you, I really can’t tell you.”</p><p>“Jin Ren.”</p><p>“Rao!</p><p>Director Zhou shouted loudly, then jumped up in fright.</p><p>After he looked around, he realized that the Soundproof Barrier was still there. He lowered his voice and sobbed. “Young Master Xu, this is all I can do. I really can’t tell you anymore…”</p><p>“Yes.” Director Zhou really cried and wiped his tears. This was the first time this high ranking man was reduced to tears by another man in a soundproof room.</p><p>“The Rao in Yue Bei Hua Rao Dao?”</p><p>“Wu wu, I don’t want to die…” Director Zhou closed his eyes in despair. “Young Master Xu, why are you asking so many questions?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused as the man took out a handkerchief and wiped away his tears. He waited for a while before he said. “I want to ask if the Three</p><p>Incenses can withstand Xu Xiaoshou’s counterattack.”</p><p>Director Zhou felt that there was a ray of light that appeared in the dark world. His eyes widened and he leaned closer.</p><p>“What does Young Master Xu mean?”</p><p>“I know where Xu Xiaoshou is… To be exact, it was my guard Jin Ren who happened to see him when he was on a mission..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
