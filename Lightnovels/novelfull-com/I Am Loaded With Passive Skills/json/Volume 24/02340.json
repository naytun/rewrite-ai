The safety of the trial-takers will be supervised by this Saint throughout the entire process. There will not be any variable outside the trial that will affect the safety of the trial-takers.” Saint… Hua Ying lowered her head silently.</p><p>Every time she heard Uncle Wei, who was always calm and collected, call himself that, it meant that some people had gone too far.</p><p>The sickly young master didn’t realize that he was being overly curious. As soon as Wei An stopped speaking, he picked up onto his small ‘problem’ and said in surprise.</p><p>“Variable?”</p><p>“There are still variables in the Four Symbols Secret Realm? Is it from the Ran</p><p>Ming ruins?”</p><p>The entire venue echoed with a collective ‘Wow’ sound.</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p>How dare he? Every sentence he said was related to the Ran Ming ruins?</p><p>“+(In Awe, Passive Points+) +9999.”</p><p>Wei An stared silently at Xu Gusheng. After a long time, he took a deep breath, flexed his fingers and looked away.</p><p>“The Q & A session is over.”</p><p>“Eh? Uncle… oh sorry, Demi-saint Wei An, I still have a question!”</p><p>Wei An’s eyes seemed to be ablaze as he looked over. He suddenly asked, “Xu</p><p>Gusheng, may I ask if you are a trial-taker?”</p><p>The sickly young master was stunned. He suddenly felt that his aura was weaker than the others and even his body was a little shorter. He said weakly.</p><p>“I, I’m not…”</p><p>“But you asked me if I had any questions, so I, I asked…”</p><p>Everyone was petrified.</p><p>Everyone felt their minds go blank. They didn’t know how to look at Young Master Xu.</p><p>You’re actually just a passerby?</p><p>Then you’re just blindly meddling in our affairs and being nosy!</p><p>At a certain moment, someone seemed to have heard the sound of clenched fists that came from the sky, but no one dared to check who did that.</p><p>Wei An was very ‘calm’ and did not say anything unnecessary. It was as if Xu Gusheng had never appeared in his life.</p><p>He looked at the trial-takers in the square who truly had ‘no questions’.</p><p>“The Holy Palace Trial will begin in the Four Symbols Secret Realm in one hour!”</p><p>“All the trial-takers present, your first mission is to rush to the Four Symbols Secret Realm within an hour. It does not matter what method you use… Those who can’t do it will be eliminated instantly!”</p><p>An hour?</p><p>In the square, the geniuses from the five regions were shocked. They even thought that Wei An did this to them to vent his anger.</p><p>However, it was only a whisper, and no one dared to question it.</p><p>This was a demi-saint!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou who was outside the arena, was also stunned.</p><p>An hour?</p><p>Wasn’t there still more than ten days?</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>I haven’t even invited my ‘peerless genius’!</p><p>The fog bomb that I left in the Three Incenses hasn’t even exploded yet!</p><p>Other than to earn Passive Points, isn’t the reason why I’m doing this in this square to confirm the appearance of the Ran Ming ruins? This matter hadn’t even started to ferment yet!</p><p>A thunderbolt flashed in his mind…</p><p>Aunt Xiang pushed the door open and entered. With a serious expression, she said, “Something happened.” Only then did Xu Xiaoshou realize what had happened!</p><p>He hurriedly raised the fan in his hand, poked his head out and asked.</p><p>“Wei…”</p><p>“For those who have nothing to do with it, please do not ask any more questions! Trial takers, please set off! This Saint wait for you in the Four Symbols Secret Realm!”</p><p>With a swish, Wei An disappeared. It was as if he would lose control if he stayed here for another second..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
