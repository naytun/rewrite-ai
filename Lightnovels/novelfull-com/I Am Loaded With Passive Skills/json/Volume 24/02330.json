This was once Xu Xiaoshou’s greatest joy.</p><p>This time, he stood in the vanishing world, and the threads on his hands were endless, forming an invisible “Hand of God”.</p><p>One after another…</p><p>Soon, the spirit threads turned into tens of thousands and pierced into the body of one of the red hunting token killers in Three Incenses.</p><p>If one were to analyze them closely, one would be able to see that these spirit threads had penetrated the vital acupoints of the killer’s body.</p><p>The corresponding positions were all drawn out in the diagram in Jin Ren’s hands just now!</p><p>Under the Vanishing Technique, even if the spirit threads turned into a slap and slapped the killer, he would not feel anything.</p><p>After all, there was nothing between them, just like the two worlds of Yin and Yang.</p><p>Under the meticulous control of Jin Ren, the tens of thousands of spirit threads trembled as the killer walked and followed closely.</p><p>After ten breaths of experience…</p><p>Jin Ren realized that this could be done very easily.</p><p>With his current mental strength, he could easily make those spirit threads never leave the targeted killer’s acupoints.</p><p>Therefore, he removed the disappearing state of the spirit threads that had penetrated deep into the acupoints of the killer’s body.</p><p>In Three Incenses, Ghost Blade, who was about to go to the mission board to see what new missions there were, trembled slightly.</p><p>He was horrified to find that his soul seemed to have been forced into a cage. Another divine soul had entered his body and taken control of his body!</p><p>“Help!”</p><p>“There’s a ghost!”</p><p>Ghost Blade wanted to shout.</p><p>However, his voice only echoed in the depths of his soul.</p><p>His body had already returned to normal, and in the eyes of others, it was extremely natural.</p><p>A great fear arose from the bottom of his heart. Even the gray fog that was born from the incense burner and hung on the ceiling of the Three Incenses seemed to be covered in horror.</p><p>Possession!</p><p>He’s been possessed!</p><p>Someone save him, save him!</p><p>“Ghost Blade?”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“Why do you seem a little strange?”</p><p>“What are you doing…Do you want to roll up your pants and pluck the hair on your legs?”</p><p>“Hot.</p><p>“What? Isn’t it snowing outside…”</p><p>Ghost Blade was shocked to find that his body was making its own sound.</p><p>What was terrifying was that this sound was not what he wanted to make. Someone was imitating his voice!</p><p>Let him go…</p><p>He had killed many people, but does such retribution really exist in this world?</p><p>Was this considered possession?</p><p>Who was possessing him?</p><p>Ghost Blade walked to a corner that no one cared about and suddenly turned to look at the sky.</p><p>At this moment, he saw the square sky outside the four-corner window. In the void where no one was paying attention, there was a small white cat head slowly expanding in his pupils.</p><p>In the left eye of the cat’s head, three flowers were rotating and flowing into</p><p>one point. It was extremely strange.</p><p>Ghost Blade’s eyes were dull as he repeated something silently</p><p>“Forget the fact that you have been possessed…”</p><p>“Forget…” “Forget that you might experience a little pain next…”</p><p>“Forget…”</p><p>“Look straight at me…”</p><p>“Look straight at me…”</p><p>The cat’s head disappeared.</p><p>Ghost Blade’s dazed eyes were still looking up at the other side.</p><p>A pair of eyes appeared in the void on the other side, and their pupils seemed to shoot out a dark light.</p><p>Soul Reading!</p><p>Ghost Blade’s trembling soul was trapped in the cage. He had completely fallen into darkness and lost all his senses of the outside world.</p><p>Ghost Blade leisurely turned around in the corner. The corners of his lips curled up as he strode up to the second floor and knocked on a certain room.</p><p>“Who is it?” Director Zhou pushed open the door and saw an unfamiliar face. He frowned.</p><p>“Director Zhou, I’m Ghost Blade. Do you still remember me?”</p><p>“I remember. What’s the matter?”</p><p>“Yes! Director Zhou, I have made a major discovery!”</p><p>“Speak.”</p><p>“That’s not good, right at the door? Director Zhou, aren’t you going to invite me in for a seat? Let me bask in the light of the second floor. Hehe, I think there’s still tea there…”</p><p>“Take a piss and look in the mirror. Are you worthy?”</p><p>“Uhh.”</p><p>“If you have something to say, say it!”</p><p>“Uh, alright then. Director Zhou, what I want to report is that I discovered the</p><p>Saint Servant…”</p><p>“Wait!” Director Zhou’s pupils trembled.</p><p>“Come in and talk..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
