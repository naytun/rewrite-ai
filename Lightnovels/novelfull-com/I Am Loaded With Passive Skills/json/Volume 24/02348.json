The one he is using should be from Jiang Buyi.” “Sure.” Ai Cangsheng praised.</p><p>After a pause, he spoke again. This time, he sounded a little more curious. “Bazhun’an is so decisive. It’s a little unexpected. It seems that he also knows that the initiative this time is not in his hands…Did you really calculate that?”</p><p>“No, I didn’t think of anything in advance.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang picked up another piece and placed it on the chessboard. He then looked up and smiled at Ai Cangsheng.</p><p>“However, in a game of chess, how it is played and who is playing against whom should have a fixed pattern and result.”</p><p>“Fate only gave life two processes: ‘winning by stability’ and ‘winning by surprise.’</p><p>“I’m not afraid of a surprise attack. What I’m afraid of is that I’m not the one who’s sure to win.”</p><p>With a snap, the white piece fell on the chessboard. The crisp sound echoed in the empty and quiet Saint Hall.</p><p>“The army advances perilously, their sound roaring like thunder.” “Appearing feeble outwardly, their strength already waning.”</p><p>“Ai Cangsheng, it’s your turn.”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The saint calamity passed through the shattered sky of the Four Symbols Secret Realm and blasted towards the distant Black Tortoise Range.</p><p>This was the first thunder calamity.</p><p>In terms of strength, it was not as strong as the Supreme Saint Calamity of the Water Ghost on Abyss Island, but it was still a saint calamity.</p><p>The moment this thing appeared, it covered the entire Black Tortoise Range.</p><p>Even the neighboring areas of the other three ranges were affected. …Wouldn’t those innate stage trial-takers die the moment they entered?</p><p>“This is crazy!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked to the north in shock. He couldn’t believe that his own people were undergoing the calamity.</p><p>However, Cen Qiaofu’s voice was too easy to recognize.</p><p>After hearing it once and seeing it, Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he had seen the entire life of the old woodcutter of the Southern Region. How this woodcutter had comprehended the path one day and went through sanctification overnight.</p><p>Looking back carefully, Cen Qiaofu seemed to have a life that ordinary people couldn’t replicate.</p><p>He had comprehended the path while chopping firewood.</p><p>He had spent most of his life comprehending the mortal world.</p><p>In exchange, he would be able to gain enlightenment in a single day, and then go from the Acquired Stage of Spirit Cultivation to the Sovereign Dao Realm. At the same time, he would also be able to sever the Nine Death Thunder Calamity and his own path.</p><p>In terms of time, the time it took for ordinary geniuses to slowly cultivate to the Cutting Path Level was similar to Cen Qiaofu’s.</p><p>But the process was incomparable!</p><p>To a certain extent, Cen Qiaofu’s experience was not worse than the legend of ‘Three breaths for innate stage, three years for Sword Deity’.</p><p>However, just like an unknown Sword Deity, everyone around Bazhun’an seemed to have their light suppressed.</p><p>No matter how talented and outstanding they were, the difference between a firefly and a bright moon was forever insignificant.</p><p>However, at a certain point in time, at a certain location, when the light was focused on him alone.</p><p>At this time, the world would wake up and think, “Ah? So there was also such a character?”</p><p>“Not all higher voids can reach sanctification…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was one of the eleven first-grade Saint Servant Nine Thrones.</p><p>He realized that Cen Qiaofu was the only one who could go through sanctification after he got the semi-saint person on Abyss Island.</p><p>And it was so outrageous and powerful that he was directly sanctified under the eyes of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>Without a doubt, this was a clear shield!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know if his words of asking Li Fugui to send him off had worked, or if Bazhun ‘an had intended to do so.</p><p>However, he had been caught off guard by Dao Qiongcang and was still a little confused after entering the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>Now, everything was clear. “Thunder Attack! ”</p><p>Bazhun’an had decided for him.</p><p>He didn’t need to worry about the rest. He just needed to find the Sacred Beast Qilin and complete the communication.</p><p>Of course, this was done in secret.</p><p>The operation of the Ran Ming Ruins still had to be carried out at the same time.</p><p>Otherwise, with the flamboyant Elder Dao’s ability, he would have found out that Cen Qiaofu was already going through sanctification in the Four Symbols Secret Realm, but there was no Xu Xiaoshou in Ran Ming Ruins…</p><p>Was Xu Xiaoshou asleep?</p><p>He must be doing something bigger somewhere else!</p><p>“Lord Shou, what should we do?” The little ferret on his chest crawled out and looked at the saint calamity in the sky with lingering fear.</p><p>At least the Abyss Island still had a buffer. Once the Four Symbols Secret Realm entered, the final battle would begin immediately.</p><p>“Where is Ran Ming Ruins?” Xu Xiaoshou took out the little ferret.</p><p>“It’s at the edge of the Azure Dragon Range.”</p><p>“There is a place called the Black Water Stream where the Azure Dragon Range and the other three ranges meet.”</p><p>“It’s an abyss that’s covered in black fog all year round. If you go down thousands of feet and cross the Black Water Barrier, you’ll find Ran Ming</p><p>Ruins.”</p><p>“Lord Shou knows about the Dead Sea, right?”</p><p>“Yes.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded.</p><p>The little ferret shivered and said,</p><p>“I heard that the black water of the Black Water Stream is connected to the power of the Holy Palace’s Shengxuan Gate. It has a spell restrictive barrier similar to the Dead Sea.”</p><p>“I can understand it as that kind of… Well, how should I put it…”</p><p>“No need to describe it. I know.” Xu Xiaoshou said in a deep voice. He had a bad feeling.</p><p>Wasn’t this the deep sea under the Lone Cliff?</p><p>However, this time, Holy Divine Palace was in control of the situation. Moreover, they could also use the power of Spell Forbidden Barrier like the one at the Inner Island of Abyss Island.</p><p>The key to breaking out of this situation was whether the Saint Servants and the other dark forces could move freely after entering the Black Water Stream.</p><p>However, this time, there was no secondary plane door!</p><p>“Shengxuan Gate…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was no stranger to this term.</p><p>He could still remember what Principal Ye Xiaotian had said on the Lone Cliff.</p><p>As far as he knew, there were only three places in the Shengshen Continent that had Spell Forbidden Barrier..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
