The actual participants of the trial remained silent as they waited solemnly in the square.</p><p>Hua Ying was not afraid. After she set aside all other thoughts, she strode forward and walked into the center of the platform and spoke loudly.</p><p>“Everyone, as you can see, the Holy Palace Trial is about to begin.”</p><p>“This trial will be held in the Four Symbols Secret Realm. Let’s cut to the chase.</p><p>Let me first talk about the rules of this Holy Palace Trial.’</p><p>Hua Ying paused and looked around silently and was about to continue speaking.</p><p>A voice that was out of place suddenly rang out from the crowd that waited quietly below.</p><p>“Sorry to interrupt.”</p><p>“Lord Holy Palace envoy, if I may ask a question?”</p><p>The Golden Phoenix Square suddenly became noisy.</p><p>She hadn’t even said anything yet and somebody already had a question?</p><p>Everyone looked for the source of the voice and turned their heads as they tried to find the fearless fellow.</p><p>“Which blind person dared to interrupt the Holy Palace envoy?” Hua Ying was also annoyed and frowned as she looked towards the source of the voice.</p><p>Soon, everyone saw the crowd in the square part and a handsome young master who had an extraordinary temperament, walked in.</p><p>He had two maids with him and both of them were very beautiful.</p><p>Even so, the two women’s looks were overshadowed by the appearance of this sickly young master.</p><p>He stood out among the crowd in the square like an immortal in the mortal world, surrounded by dust and insignificance.</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>Hua Ying looked at the man and said.</p><p>She had seen many good-looking people and was used to it. This person was just as good-looking as Senior Uncle Xu!</p><p>However, there was no trace of any Upper Spirit energy on this sickly young master’s body. His aura was actually extraordinary, so he must have some unique insights.</p><p>Outside the square, Old Man Li leaned against the carriage and waited. When he looked into the distance, he could only see a dense crowd of people.</p><p>However, the sounds were transmitted out precisely, and it could be heard both inside and outside the square.</p><p>Old Man Li couldn’t help but laugh when he heard Young Master Xu’s words. He recalled the most truthful information he had about Young Master Xu.</p><p>“Playing to the grandstand to please the crowd.”</p><p>It was really better to hear about someone rather than to meet him in person!</p><p>The announcement of the Holy Palace Trial had yet to begin, but Young Master Xu had already begun to play up! “+(Watched, Passive Points+) +9999.” “+(Suspected, Passive Points+)+6255.”</p><p>“+(Revered, Passive Points+)+663.”</p><p>With just one statement, his Passive Points soared.</p><p>These Passive Points were the ones that could only be increased when one challenged Yan Wuse in the Light Energy Realm on Abyss Island or even forcefully resisted Wangze Holy Emperor’s windless zone.</p><p>“And now, I only need to say something inappropriate at an inappropriate time.</p><p>That’s enough.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou really didn’t want to be a clown who tried to please the public. However, the Passive Points issued were too crazy for him to resist. He had to do it.</p><p>At this moment, he could not help but smile.</p><p>If it weren’t for the fact that he wanted to maintain the image of the sickly young master, Xu Gusheng, he would have jumped three feet high and shouted, “I’m an Innate Stage master!”</p><p>This was even crazier…</p><p>Of course, Xu Xiaoshou still had some dignity.</p><p>Under everyone’s gaze, he continued to keep up the sickly young master act as he walked slowly and steadily.</p><p>He entered the square, one step at a time.</p><p>Just the process of walking took the sickly young master over ten breaths of time; it was as if he was taking a stroll in his own backyard.</p><p>“What was Young Master Xu up to?!”</p><p>Yingying and Qiao’er’s cheeks were red, and their feet dragged on the ground.</p><p>The two of them had encountered a lot of things, but at this moment, they could not withstand the gazes from this large number of people.</p><p>It was as if there were knives on their backs!</p><p>It was as if a fishbone had gotten stuck in their throats!</p><p>Even his walking posture seemed slightly deformed, as if he did not know how to walk properly.</p><p>This was the Golden Phoenix Square!</p><p>The people here were the elites of the five regions!</p><p>How could he put them in such an embarrassing situation?</p><p>Shouldn’t they have waited for the Holy Palace envoy to finish her announcement and then leave? Young Master Xu didn’t even tell us that there was a question and answer segment.</p><p>They were not prepared at all… The two women looked at each other and saw the extreme awkwardness in each other’s eyes. Their heads were lowered as if they were about to bury themselves in their chests, and they almost closed their eyes as they followed.</p><p>+(Awaiting, Passive Points+)+9999.”</p><p>+(Glared at, Passive Points,+)+6886.”</p><p>On the high platform, Hua Ying waited till the flowers almost withered!</p><p>She was so angry that she almost made an explosive flower and wanted to plant it directly on that sickly young master’s head. However, she had to remind herself continuously.</p><p>She was the Holy Palace’s envoy and had to calm down, otherwise her Supreme Master would punish her!</p><p>“This trial-taker, if you have any questions, please speak as soon as possible. My time is very limited!” Hua Ying gritted her teeth.</p><p>“Sorry, I am not good at walking…”</p><p>The sickly young master’s first sentence stunned everyone, and then the next drove them crazy. “I usually take a carriage.”</p><p>The Golden Phoenix Square exploded.</p><p>Everyone could tell that this guy was here to cause trouble!</p><p>“F*ck you…” Someone jumped out from the crowd and was about to draw his sword.</p><p>However, his sword had yet to be unsheathed…</p><p>“Bang! ”</p><p>A loud explosion sounded.</p><p>The man and his sword were sent flying into the air and disappeared from the square.</p><p>The Path Principles appeared in the air around the Golden Phoenix Square, as if someone was about to jump out.</p><p>At the high platform, the geniuses who were about to participate in the Holy Palace Trial were also shocked.</p><p>They didn’t see any traces of the attacker just now!</p><p>That attack also did not seem to come from the sickly young master, but…</p><p>“His guard?”</p><p>Even Hua Ying could not tell who the attacker was..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
