Looking at the expression on his face, he must have associated his final words with immense horror.</p><p>What would it be?</p><p>Was it possible that the giant hand that manipulated the rules of the Great Path in the fantasy realm really existed?</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to ask more. He was still in a state of acting and had to maintain his persona. If he revealed his ignorance, it would only increase Fu Zhi’s suspicion of him.</p><p>Fu Zhi’s expression had entirely changed when he looked at him.</p><p>From the disdain at the beginning to the astonishment after being suppressed to the ecstasy of attaining realization… Now, it had evolved into…</p><p>Feared, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>What was going on? What was he thinking?</p><p>“You are…”</p><p>Fu Zhi hesitated for a moment. In the end, he could not help but ask the question that was troubling him. “Are you a descendant of the Holy Emperor?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou creased his brows when he heard that.</p><p>The Holy Emperor… He knew about that.</p><p>The most powerful existence in this world, or rather this continent, was the Holy Emperor State.</p><p>However, there were only legends about the Holy Emperor that had been passed down to the world.</p><p>The legend said that…</p><p>Even the first person of Shengshen Continent, the prevailing Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang of Holy Divine Palace, seemed to be a step away from this level.</p><p>The realm of the Holy Emperor seemed to be akin to the Spiritual Gods on this continent.</p><p>It was just blind faith and had never appeared before.</p><p>Now, Fu Zhi had said that…</p><p>He was a descendant of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his heart surging in excitement. Fu Zhi must have known something that he didn’t.</p><p>Was it possible that the big hand that manipulated the World Order was the Hand of the Holy Emperor?</p><p>Even if he was puzzled, Xu Xiaoshou did not press on.</p><p>No matter how chummy Fu Zhi had behaved toward him, he was only an outsider. Perhaps Elder Sang would know about these things too.</p><p>Elder Sang…</p><p>That old man was certainly not simple.</p><p>Just the thought of the giant hand, recalling his terrifying Qiu Long Words and the Heavens and Earth Chest Match…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shuddered. He felt his heart palpitating inexplicably and did not dare to continue thinking about it.</p><p>That theory could only be used to fool Fu Zhi.</p><p>In the end, he even scared himself.</p><p>After realizing how ridiculous that was, Xu Xiaoshou shook his head slightly.</p><p>He did not respond directly to Fu Zhi’s question but said, “Now that you have figured out this situation, what are your plans?”</p><p>Fu Zhi gave him a deep look without seeming too flustered. He gathered his thoughts after hearing Xu Xiaoshou’s words.</p><p>“Naturally, I have to clean myself up and go to meet my baby girl, who hasn’t seen me in a long time.”</p><p>Speaking of his daughter, Fu Zhi suddenly burst into laughter. “It is also fate. Today, with the help of Brother Shou, I have not only realized the Divine Array but also experienced a breakthrough.”</p><p>“Thinking of it, I’m not far from breaking through the Grand Master Stage.”</p><p>He slapped Xu Xiaoshou’s shoulder excitedly as he spoke, but a force bounced his hand away.</p><p>Fu Zhi was stunned for a long time. Astonishment flashed in his eyes, but he did not care and continued to happily say, “Brother Shou, you must stay! I will set a banquet tonight at the City Lord Mansion, and I will treat you well!”</p><p>“By the way, I will also introduce you to my nephew and niece. They are some of the finest people among the younger generation!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou instantly felt his knees going weak.</p><p>Nephew and niece?</p><p>Was he referring to Fu Xing and Fu Yinhong?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly waved his hand, “If you want to set a banquet, that isn’t necessary.”</p><p>“Since you were trapped here, you are not aware that the City Lord Mansion is very lively tonight.”</p><p>“Oh?” Fu Zhi was surprised, “What are the activities going on?”</p><p>“White Cave.”</p><p>With just two words, Fu Zhi understood everything all at once.</p><p>He counted the time. It seemed that from the moment he got the Cardinal Wheel to the present, it was almost time to catch up with the next round the extradimensional space would open.</p><p>But…</p><p>“Is it such a coincidence?” He found it hard to believe.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled and asked, “If the White Cave was not going to open, how could I come here, and how could you get out? The City Lord Mansion has to allocate places.”</p><p>“This is not a coincidence. This is God’s will!”</p><p>Fu Zhi was overjoyed. “Great! In that case, we will go to the banquet now and introduce my daughter to…”</p><p>“No!” Xu Xiaoshou interrupted his words. “Have you forgotten something?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“My junior sister!”</p><p>His request jolted the other party into a shock, and Fu Zhi hurriedly replied, “Yes, I almost forgot about it! I still have one thing left to do. Wait a minute!”</p><p>“Your junior sister is there. I’ll let her out now.” Fu Zhi smiled apologetically.</p><p>Having said that, he turned around and was about to fly to the place where he originally came.</p><p>The two of them were suddenly startled.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately released his spiritual senses. Once again, he found a trace of life from the place where Fu Zhi flew out.</p><p>It was slightly familiar.</p><p>“The Cardinal Wheel!”</p><p>Fu Zhi’s pupils dilated in horror. Without even thinking about it, he fled.</p><p>After four years of attracting no one’s attention, Fu Zhi had long forgotten that many people were obsessed with the Cardinal Wheel in this world.</p><p>Now that the White Cave was opening, how could these guys give up on their quest?</p><p>His negligence was the root cause of this theft.</p><p>How could he leave the Cardinal Wheel where it was?</p><p>Even if the collection procedure was extremely complicated, he should have allocated time for it first.</p><p>However, when Fu Zhi recalled Xu Xiaoshou’s move that instantly detonated the sea of flowers, he knew that he did not have much reaction time at all.</p><p>At that time, he could not blame Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>After all, it was not intentional.</p><p>The thief was the one to be feared.</p><p>During the time he spent chatting with Xu Xiaoshou, if that person knew how to collect the Cardinal Wheel, it would be enough for him to get away with his heist.</p><p>However, who was that powerful cultivator who could remain unexposed and undetected at such a close distance for such a long time?</p><p>It was not until the very last moment of the collection that the burst of Divine Force had revealed a trace of his existence through his vitality breath.</p><p>Fu Zhi was frightened and deeply regretful at the same time for being so careless.</p><p>As he mulled over the sequence of events, his figure instantly appeared in the original sky.</p><p>He scanned the area thoroughly. He could only detect an unlocked spiritual array and a pit the size of a tree stump that was already on the ground. There was nothing else in sight.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>Fu Zhi clenched his fists and cracked his knuckles.</p><p>Was it really stolen?</p><p>At that moment, he exploded and unleashed his anger.</p><p>Although Fu Zhi had not left this place for four years, did the world outside forget about his existence?</p><p>Right at that moment, dozens of figures flew over from the sky.</p><p>Fu Yinhong and Liu Qing spearheaded the arriving group.</p><p>When those two saw the scruffy man on the ground, who looked like he had given up all hope, they were caught by surprise initially. Then, there was an incredible light in their eyes.</p><p>“Father?!”</p><p>“City Lord?!”</p><p>The many people behind them were equally pleasantly surprised.</p><p>Was the blast in the back garden just now caused by the old City Lord who had shattered the barrier?</p><p>If that was true, how powerful was he now?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
