Once he thought about what had happened to the Su Family, Zhang Zhongmou calmly restricted his impulse.</p><p>In these sensitive times, he knew that Tiansang City was highly unstable.</p><p>Some strong existences might have had weird and strange behaviors.</p><p>If his slight irrationality were to cause the downfall of the Zhang family, Zhang Zhongmou would be the first one to not be able to forgive himself.</p><p>Thinking about this, Zhang Zhongmou took a deep breath.</p><p>“I have thought hard. I really do not have any grievances or problems with you.”</p><p>“Why did you first blast the eastern wing of Zhang Mansion, and then now try to come after our treasure in the Hidden Scriptures Pavilion?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not respond to him.</p><p>When he was talking, how could he let someone else take the lead?</p><p>He looked over casually and said, “You have three chances. Are you ready to start guessing?”</p><p>Zhang Zhongmou paused for a moment. The flames of anger in his eyes started to burn again.</p><p>This guy was asking for a beating.</p><p>Did he really think that the three big Sovereigns of Zhang Mansion were so easily bullied?</p><p>“I have never met you before, so how would I know?” he replied coldly.</p><p>“Never met before?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou let out a laugh and decided to play along. “If that is the case, do you really not know my reason for coming?”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhang Zhongmou paused.</p><p>Could it be that the Zhang family had unknowingly offended someone, and he was now here for payback?</p><p>His expressions tightened as he said solemnly, “I do not know all the trivial matters of the family. Please get straight to the point.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened his mouth. Coupled with his scarred face, he looked frightening.</p><p>“Trivial matter?”</p><p>“It seems like the Zhang Family is all high and almighty. Is a Sovereign assassin also considered a trivial matter?”</p><p>Lightning flashed across Zhang Zhongmou’s mind. He instantly understood.</p><p>‘It’s him!’</p><p>He had always found the fact that Xu Xiaoshou could manage to kill a Sovereign Stage assassin to be weird.</p><p>As expected, there were bodyguards around this guy.</p><p>Now, since the assassin did not complete the job, his bodyguards had come.</p><p>In just a short while, Zhang Zhongmou’s forehead was dripping with sweat.</p><p>This was a person who could kill a Sovereign.</p><p>He was someone who could escape under the eyes of the City Lord Mansion even after killing a Sovereign.</p><p>He was also someone who could escape in the day only to intrude at night to directly cause the entire eastern wing to explode.</p><p>Even though Zhang Zhongmou was a Sovereign, would he be this guy’s match even if he was at his best state?</p><p>It was widely known that once someone entered the Sovereign Stage, they were not like ordinary cultivators who could be killed whenever and however.</p><p>Under the same stage of cultivation, the battles could last for a dozen days without any winner or loser, as well as possibly no deaths.</p><p>The fact that this guy could kill a Sovereign Stage assassin from The Three Incense meant that his abilities were definitely top class.</p><p>At this point, Zhang Zhongmou had already forgotten why this strong cultivator had to disguise himself as a door guard to enter.</p><p>He was filled with anxiety and almost ready to ask for help.</p><p>“Do you want to call for help?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou called him out just in time.</p><p>This tone of suspicion almost caused Zhang Zhongmou’s heart to jump out of his throat.</p><p>“No, no such thing. Those are such… heavy words.” Zhang Zhongmou’s lips were dry.</p><p>He restrained his impulsive hand.</p><p>Even if he called for help, he was suddenly unsure whether they would be able to defeat this strange guy in front of him.</p><p>On the other hand, Xu Xiaoshou could not remain calm anymore.</p><p>Seeing that the old man was overly anxious shocked him as well.</p><p>How much did this guy overthink?</p><p>His original intention was to just act like the masked man to scare him.</p><p>Who would have thought that this old man would be frightened to this extent?</p><p>‘Could it be that he is faking as well?’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>He suddenly realized that because of the difference in cultivation levels between them, even if this old man were to secretly call for help, he would not even know it.</p><p>“Are you lying to me?”</p><p>He said coldly, replacing the smile on his face with a serious look.</p><p>Zhang Zhongmou panicked a little.</p><p>He really did not move at all, so how would he have called for help?</p><p>This enemy was someone who could kill a Sovereign and seemed to be of the Cutting Path Level. Even if there were three sovereigns here, wouldn’t the result still be the same?</p><p>At most, there would only be a delay of two more seconds.</p><p>“Mister…”</p><p>“Don’t mister me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was annoyed and cut him off. No matter whether this old man called for help or not, he could not wait anymore.</p><p>If he waited any longer, and he would be exposed.</p><p>If he were to really leave just like that, wouldn’t that just prove that he was indeed just a fake?</p><p>Earlier, he still said that he wanted to take one item from the Hidden Scriptures Pavilion. If he were to flee due to the other party’s suspicious actions…</p><p>Even if he wanted to die, this was not the way.</p><p>He bit down on his teeth. Without speaking any further, he waved his hand and grabbed his Yuan Mansion.</p><p>Light flashed as a short boy wearing a straw hat appeared.</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>The soft call caused Zhang Zhongmou to pause.</p><p>‘Another fella with no cultivation?’</p><p>He glanced at the young man in front of him.</p><p>To be honest, an Innate Stage cultivator, in his eyes, was no different from this guy who just appeared with no cultivation at all.</p><p>Moreover, their age…</p><p>The idea that had been abandoned earlier by him was instantly revived.</p><p>Were these two young men faking it?</p><p>Zhang Zhongmou was instantly furious. If this young man had been faking it all along, then he would be ashamed for the rest of his life.</p><p>A top-class Sovereign cultivator being afraid of an Innate Stage cultivator…</p><p>‘If word of this gets out… How can this f*cking get out?’</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not care at all and immediately gave the order to kill.</p><p>He did not know whether this old man secretly called for help or not, but under the current circumstances, the only way to take control was to get the first advantage.</p><p>“Do you still dare to attack?”</p><p>Zhang Zhongmou had already realized something was amiss.</p><p>He gritted his teeth, and his eyes were red. He suddenly saw that the boy wearing the straw hat had disappeared.</p><p>‘This speed…’</p><p>‘This fella wasn’t faking it. Is he really a Sovereign?’</p><p>Zhang Zhongmou was terrified.</p><p>The world that he had built in his mind had been overthrown again, causing him to feel as if he had lost his ability to think properly.</p><p>‘Is this f*cking true or not?’</p><p>‘These two guys… What exactly is their background?’</p><p>With no time to think, he felt a breeze at the back of his head in the next second.</p><p>Zhang Zhongmou had barely turned around and put both his hands in front of him as a defense.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>One punch.</p><p>Aje stayed in the same spot while Zhang Zhongmou’s hands were fractured. He flew away like a cannonball due to the impact.</p><p>Blood spurted as he flew. Zhang Zhongmou could not even feel the pain anymore. He was stunned.</p><p>Suspected, Passive Points +1.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
