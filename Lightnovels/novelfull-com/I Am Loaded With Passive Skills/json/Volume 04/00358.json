Is it because I have not battled for quite a while so my cultivation and body have both deteriorated?’</p><p>His arm dangled downward with no energy.</p><p>Zhang Zhongmou suddenly realized something.</p><p>‘No!’</p><p>‘That is not the case!’</p><p>‘It’s that the straw hat boy’s attack power was is too terrifying!’</p><p>‘What stage of muscle strength must he possess to be able to infiltrate a Sovereign’s spiritual source, which was enhanced with cultivation, as well as the Zhang family’s Ancestral Bear Bloodline’s body, to crush the bones with just one hit?’</p><p>‘On top of that, regarding the blow from earlier, the other party did not use any spiritual source at all!’</p><p>At this moment, Zhang Zhongmou was really panicked.</p><p>A single punch might not have meant much.</p><p>If they were to really battle, he had the confidence to take him down completely.</p><p>After all, that one punch was not totally indefensible.</p><p>Most of his spiritual technique’s prowess could suppress it.</p><p>The problem now was that this straw-hat boy seemed to be a powerful person.</p><p>He appeared to have a Sovereign Physique.</p><p>‘Where did this f*cking guy come from?’</p><p>It was already very difficult for cultivators to achieve Sovereign Stage cultivation. For him to achieve a Sovereign Stage Physique…</p><p>‘That is also not the main point!’</p><p>Zhang Zhongmou shook himself awake to stop himself from thinking any further.</p><p>He knew that the scary part of the problem was not due to that.</p><p>It was whether this young man who had punched him was really so strong and did not fake his abilities.</p><p>Then, the real powerful person…</p><p>Sss!</p><p>With the sound of wind in his ear, Zhang Zhongmou regained control of his flying body. He could not help but stare at the young man wearing the guard’s uniform.</p><p>‘That fella is the real horrifying presence!’</p><p>He was panicking deep inside and felt a disturbance coming from the back of his head.</p><p>After having experienced it once, Zhang Zhongmou knew that the young man wearing the straw hat had made a move again.</p><p>If not for preparations beforehand, even Sovereigns would be injured by his horrifying speed.</p><p>Zhang Zhongmou already had the experience of dealing with this.</p><p>He flipped his body in the air. With a move of his fingers, he called out a purple shield from his ring.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Aje’s punch, which was aimed at the back of Zhang Zhongmou’s head, landed on the huge purple shield.</p><p>There was a vibration as the array patterns on the shield activated. A black source of sucking energy swallowed the force of Aje’s punch.</p><p>The purple shield shook and expanded a little. As if it had a full meal, it let out a loud burp.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at this from the back with shock.</p><p>This shield was at least a Master Stage defense spiritual weapon.</p><p>Moreover, looking at its strange ability to swallow attacks, it might even be possible that it was a Sovereign Stage weapon.</p><p>Envy flashed across his eyes. If he were to possess such a weapon, it would definitely save his life during emergencies.</p><p>After successfully blocking that attack, Zhang Zhongmou rejoiced a little.</p><p>As a Sovereign Stage cultivator, as well as possessing the Ancestral Bear Bloodline and successfully awakening the Ancestral Bear Spirit…</p><p>His favorite tactic when engaging in battle was that of close-distance combat.</p><p>But now…</p><p>‘Close-distance combat?’</p><p>‘Close f*cking combat!’</p><p>So what if he had the Ancestral Bear Spirit? He was still in essence a Spirit Cultivator. How could he use his spiritual cultivational skills to engage in close combat with a Physique Cultivator?</p><p>Zhang Zhongmou took advantage of the breathing space to instantly pull back, increasing the distance between them.</p><p>Other than close combat, his far-distance battling skills were similarly strong. They might have even been stronger if he engaged the power from the Way of the Heavens.</p><p>Using his spiritual senses, he wanted to keep his Tianyuan Mist Mountain.</p><p>This defense spiritual weapon was made using an entire spiritual mountain that had good defensive abilities.</p><p>Under such an intense and strong attack, it was not damaged at all. A simple swallow and burp neutralized the attack.</p><p>Zhang Zhongmou moved his hand and realized that his Tianyuan Mist Mountain could not be retrieved.</p><p>‘What is going on?’</p><p>Zhang Zhongmou paused and tried to use his spiritual senses again, but all he could feel was a sense of powerlessness coming from the Tianyuan Mist Mountain.</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>A call was heard. Zhang Zhongmou’s scalp was numb as he turned to look.</p><p>He saw Aje’s head was tilted, and the straw hat was slanted.</p><p>Aje was holding the purple shield in its hand, looking at it curiously with shiny red eyes.</p><p>‘What kind of a toy is this? How can it suppress my attack without being damaged?’</p><p>‘Even Ma Ma’s head had something red coming out of it after my attack!’</p><p>‘No, it can’t be…’</p><p>Zhang Zhongmou saw Aje raising its fist with its mouth agape and pupils rapidly contracting.</p><p>The next second…</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Furious yet fast explosive sounds could be heard resonating.</p><p>It was as if the death bells and drums had been mercilessly struck, and this drummer was someone who had an element of craziness in him.</p><p>Aje’s punches were so quick that they looked like afterimages. The red in its eyes shone brightly as if it had found something fun to play with.</p><p>After receiving the blows, the purple shield was not totally unresponsive.</p><p>It was just that its reaction was very minimal.</p><p>With every punch that landed on it, it still would uncontrollably expand a little.</p><p>Even if it was only a little, there was still a change.</p><p>Though the change was small, after accumulating many of them…</p><p>Aje understood this principle as it saw that the purple shield in front expand rapidly like a balloon. It became even more excited and started to hit it with even more power.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Zhang Zhongmou was stunned.</p><p>This was his Tianyuan Mist Mountain, which he had spent countless years and needed three spirit array masters to barely forge it.</p><p>This high-level weapon was priceless to him.</p><p>How could he let it be mistreated this way?</p><p>“Hey there, stop what you are doing!”</p><p>“You must not mess around with it!”</p><p>The surroundings were silent for half a second.</p><p>“Ma Ma?”</p><p>Aje stopped its attacks and lifted its head to look at Zhang Zhongmou.</p><p>At this time, the old man was no longer of any interest to Aje.</p><p>Tianyuan Mist Mountain only had time to rest for half a second, which was not even enough time to contract, before loud booming sounds could be heard again.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>It could be seen with the naked eye that this purple shield was rapidly turning red.</p><p>It was as if a balloon was blown to its maximum capacity and would explode the very next second.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Zhang Zhongmou’s entire face turned green.</p><p>Cursed, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was totally shocked by Aje’s attack power.</p><p>When he was being attacked by Red Dog at that time, Aje was imprisoned. If he could have let it out…</p><p>Just based on this mad dog’s equivalent attack speed and power…</p><p>Aje could have blocked Red Dog’s crazily strong final attack.</p><p>‘I was so wrong!’</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou was extremely sorry for ever having doubts Aje’s combat abilities.</p><p>Aje was not given a chance to showcase its power and strength in the past as it had always finished enemies off within seconds.</p><p>By looking at how Aje attacked enemies in the past, Xu Xiaoshou could understand Aje’s lower limits, but what about that of its upper limits?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
