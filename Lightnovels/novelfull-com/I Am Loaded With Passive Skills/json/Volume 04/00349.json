It was obviously impossible to stir the crowds with a spectacle of this scale.</p><p>In the small manor that was Xu Xiaoshou’s new home…</p><p>Xin Gugu stood up abruptly in surprise.</p><p>After listening to Xu Xiaoshou’s plans, he looked as though as he had swallowed explosives.</p><p>He was excited and frenzied at the same time.</p><p>“Are you crazy to be attacking the Zhang family at night?”</p><p>“Is the time tonight?”</p><p>Who was the ghost beast host body? This kid must have been the real-life ghost beast.</p><p>Was confronting the Zhang family face-to-face in Tiansang City something that Origin Court Stage cultivators could even dream of?</p><p>By just thinking about it, was it not blasphemy against the strict order of this land?</p><p>An Innate Stage?</p><p>Planning a night attack on the Zhang family?</p><p>“Heh.” Xin Gugu sneered coldly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at him fixedly. “You are right. Not only will it be tonight, but it is also almost time based on the sky.”</p><p>“If you have no objections, we can leave now.”</p><p>“I…” For a moment, Xin Gugu was at a loss for words. “Are you kidding?”</p><p>Doubted, Passive Point +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded and glanced at him.</p><p>“You have also seen Yuan Mansion. There is no problem with it. Even Cutting Path or Higher Void Stage may not be able to grasp the order within.”</p><p>“At most, they would only feel a sense of strangeness.”</p><p>“So, what is there to worry about?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly raised his tone, and he asked uncertainly, “Are you afraid?”</p><p>“Afraid?”</p><p>Xin Gugu puffed his chest out. There was no doubt he was exasperated now.</p><p>“Since when have I ever been afraid?”</p><p>“Hehe, that’s fine. Let’s go.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou spoke and walked away in the next instant, leaving the house first.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>“Did he just leave?”</p><p>Xin Gugu spoke aloud, but he still felt a strong shock.</p><p>Was this kid treating critical decisions so casually?</p><p>He said he wanted to buy a house and proceeded to buy it. Now, he was saying that he wanted to destroy the Zhang family, but could he destroy it like that?</p><p>It would be impossible to destroy.</p><p>Could it be just as he said and he only wanted to light up some fireworks and cause them to jump around in a frenzy?</p><p>What was the point of this?</p><p>‘Why would anyone want to do such a thankless thing?’</p><p>Xin Gugu frowned, but he thought of that scruffy-looking man and his promise to him. Even if this young man was unruly, he would do his best to protect him.</p><p>For the first time, he did not need someone else to clean up his mess. Nonetheless, Xin Gugu felt a strange feeling in his heart at the thought of being responsible for protecting someone.</p><p>To be honest, this feeling made him very uneasy.</p><p>‘I hope everything goes fine.’</p><p>He strode forward to keep up with the pace of the young man who had a head start.</p><p>“Oh, right!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly stopped to take Aje from his arms and morphed him casually.</p><p>“Get to know this guy here. He is called Aje and is very powerful. You will probably have to work together later.”</p><p>“As for me, I might just be a wallflower.”</p><p>Xin Gugu was taken aback.</p><p>He looked at what appeared to be a little boy wearing a hat before him. A look of hesitation crossed his face.</p><p>‘Does this guy have any cultivation level?’</p><p>Aje was also judging him at the same time.</p><p>It could observe the people around it by following Xu Xiaoshou. Although it had never seen the other in person, this was not the first time it had met Xin Gugu.</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>Under the instruction of Xu Xiaoshou, it had stopped its habit of attacking people at random.</p><p>Or rather, it had learned that the way to greet others was not to shove their heads into the floor.</p><p>“Cough, Ma Ma?</p><p>Xin Gugu looked at Xu Xiaoshou with a look of confusion. One could almost see question marks on his face.</p><p>What was all of this about?</p><p>“It’s fine. Just get acquainted.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand casually. He did not expect Xin Gugu to communicate with Aje.</p><p>He only intended for them to meet in advance. This was so they would not scare each other when the time came.</p><p>If they were mentally prepared, it could only benefit each other when the time came to fight.</p><p>“That’s all for the time being. For this operation, there will be only the three of us. You just need to follow my orders.”</p><p>“There’s no need to think twice!”</p><p>This statement only caused Xin Gugu to panic further.</p><p>It was as if the blind were leading the blind. Following this person and his puppet seemed like an absurd idea.</p><p>Did this formation look fit to attack the Zhang family, the head of the four giants in Tiansang City?</p><p>‘Sister, come and save me!’</p><p>…</p><p>The sound of footsteps went away, and the shadows faded.</p><p>Under the full moon, Mu Zixi was sitting on the roof. She clutched her twin ponytails and watched the two leave. Her hands gradually slipped off.</p><p>Perplexity arose from her eyes. The little girl looked up at the moon.</p><p>Under the clear night sky, the moonlight reflected on her delicate face and outlined her petite and youthful features.</p><p>“It’s the second time… It’s the second time you watched him leave like this.”</p><p>“Actually, you have realized that you can’t keep up with him anymore.”</p><p>“Aren’t you planning to accept me now?”</p><p>A cool-sounding voice rang in her mind. The little girl closed her doe-like eyes instantly, and her elegant nose wrinkled.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>She admonished softly. The irritating voice finally disappeared without saying anything else.</p><p>“Why did things turn out like this?”</p><p>The bewilderment in Mu Zixi’s eyes grew.</p><p>She saw herself trailing far behind Xu Xiaoshou in the morning again, watching him suddenly disappear. When he appeared again, only a bloodied mess remained.</p><p>Even if she wanted to come to his rescue, Sovereign Stage cultivators were everywhere. It was difficult for her to make any progress.</p><p>Until the battle was over, and that man left, only then did she dare step forward and rescue Xu Xiaoshou with Xin Gugu.</p><p>A sense of helplessness reverberated in her heart.</p><p>Mu Zixi had always considered herself a prodigy.</p><p>She had only been in the Outer Yard for less than a year and was even likened to the gifted Su Qianqian.</p><p>Despite her aptitude, she still felt that she could not keep up with Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Without any warning, his enemy was already at the Sovereign Stage.</p><p>“My memories…”</p><p>Mu Zixi muttered.</p><p>She felt that all of this was as dreamy as her memory.</p><p>From the very beginning, the memories she could recall began at the door of Tiansang Spirit Palace. It had skipped over her childhood entirely.</p><p>Mu Zixi did not even know how old she was this year.</p><p>She had always been in search of her lost memories.</p><p>The first time a possibility occurred was at the Tianxuan Gate when she faced the grey mist figure.</p><p>It was the first time she felt that the memory sealed in her mind was loosening.</p><p>Inexplicably, she called out the words, “Holy Emperor Fengtian.”</p><p>The second time her memory loosened was a violent affair.</p><p>She recalled the appearance of the blind man, the sudden headache, the stare of Ye Xiaotian releasing his control… It had instantly caused a flood of information in her mind.</p><p>From that moment on, there would occasionally be a strange and indifferent voice in her mind.</p><p>“What nonsense!”</p><p>The more the little girl thought about it, the more irritable she got. In the end, she yanked out the roof tiles with her hands and flung them away.</p><p>“I don’t want to follow Xu Xiaoshou! Why does it keep saying that?”</p><p>She was silent for a long time before she softly spoke.</p><p>“Hmph, I’m left behind while he goes out to play…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
