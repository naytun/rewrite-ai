He still did not believe that the Expertise Passive Skill he had obtained this time was the Weaving Expertise.’</p><p>He looked at Cooking Expertise and suddenly felt that this Passive Skill was actually perfectly normal.</p><p>‘Weaving… Ah… Ah!’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost went insane. He had wanted Spirit-gathering Array Expert, not this broken thing.</p><p>‘That’s not right!’</p><p>‘Calm down!’</p><p>‘Now that I think of it, when Cooking Expertise first came out, I seemed to be also like this, right?’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou ran around the perimeter of Yuan Mansion for a few rounds before coming to a stop.</p><p>‘In this world, there do not exist any weird and useless skills. There are only those that the inventors did not… Never mind!’</p><p>‘If I think seriously for a moment, this thing and the spirit-gathering array… Ugh… Spiritual veins could actually be related!’</p><p>‘Weaving is just using strings, right? There should be some relation between strings and spiritual veins!’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded with a lack of confidence. ‘Uh, that must be it!’</p><p>Without thinking anything further, he immediately raised the level of this Weaving Expertise to Innate Stage.</p><p>A large amount of knowledge instantly entered his mind. Xu Xiaoshou’s face darkened.</p><p>‘Was it really just weaving?’</p><p>In that great amount of knowledge, there were detailed explanations of different types of stitches, needles, and plaits…</p><p>Including how to use strings, their thickness, and arrangement, as well as tips that affected the whole…</p><p>Including colors, collocation, composition…</p><p>Aesthetics, perception, artwork appreciation…</p><p>Lastly, there was a part on…</p><p>‘Rhythmic gymnastics?’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>He looked at the part about gymnastics and was left speechless.</p><p>‘Is this asking me to move and stretch more to prevent me from being overly addicted to weaving and having diseases of the vertebrae?’</p><p>With a plop, Xu Xiaoshou could not control his movements and fell onto the ground.</p><p>He looked at the vast sky and deeply exhaled a breath of air.</p><p>Puff…</p><p>He felt a little helpless, with which he struggled.</p><p>With mixed feelings and a heavy heart, Xu Xiaoshou squatted.</p><p>‘There is still some use for Innate Stage Weaving Expertise. At least, it taught me in detail about the Weaving Technique.’</p><p>‘If that is the case, when I use this method on a spirit-gathering array, can I also easily control spirit veins?’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tilted his head as he trembled. He took out a piece of Qingming Celestial Rock from his ring.</p><p>It was a foundational rock for array wheels.</p><p>By carving spirit veins on the rock to gather spiritual energy, the spirit-gathering array was formed.</p><p>He took out a carving knife, had a second thought, and put it back.</p><p>Innate Stage Weaving Expertise was honestly very useful and practical.</p><p>It taught Xu Xiaoshou how to gather his spiritual source to form a needle, which could be used on anything to practice the Weaving Technique.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pinched his fingers as a delicate spirit needle started to form.</p><p>Different from its calm appearance, this spirit needle had a spirit core within it vibrating at high speeds. It allowed this needle to carry huge destructive capabilities.</p><p>The moment he pinched the spirit needle, Xu Xiaoshou’s hand stopped trembling immediately.</p><p>As if he had undergone strict and intensive training, the young man raised his pinky finger. His face looked strange. He was just about to start weaving when he subconsciously glanced at Aje.</p><p>The expression on his face seemed as if he had been forced to do something but was seen by a familiar person.</p><p>It was quite embarrassing.</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>Aje called out softly as his line of sight shifted to land on Xu Xiaoshou’s lifted pinky finger.</p><p>“Uh.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried to retract his finger, but it bounced back by itself.</p><p>“Never mind.”</p><p>He slightly relaxed as he gave the rock a little poke.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The Qingming Celestial Rock exploded.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>‘As expected…’</p><p>The small explosion did not make Xu Xiaoshou disappointed. On the contrary, his eyes showed signs of deep thought.</p><p>‘It’s very strong!’</p><p>‘Even the Qingming Celestial Rock could be instantly broken, and it looked like it was filled… Uh… It exploded like a filled balloon…’</p><p>‘What if this was used on a person?’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hands. Tens of thousands of spirit needles appeared in the sky.</p><p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p><p>With a casual movement, the spirit needles made frantic noises.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was excited.</p><p>‘Who could defend against this?’</p><p>‘As long as that person did not guard against this, wouldn’t I be able to poke him to death?’</p><p>The attack power was not the main point. The main purpose of a spirit needle was not to be used with Qingming Celestial Rocks.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered this for a while. He immediately gave up on the physical form of carving spirit-gathering arrays.</p><p>Since the road he had taken had already gone astray, he decided to run wildly on this road ahead.</p><p>Perhaps it would be a totally new style.</p><p>He kept the tens of thousands of needles and left just a dozen. This was the limit that the Innate Stage of Weaving Expertise could control.</p><p>‘Move!’</p><p>Using his spirit senses to control it, Xu Xiaoshou viewed the sky and earth as the array wheel, used the spirit-gathering array as a carving knife, and started carving in the air.</p><p>Even though Weaving Expertise did not bring the way of spirit-gathering array carving, in the past few days, Xu Xiaoshou had already studied and memorized the stuff that Li Seven had left behind.</p><p>The key to spirit-gathering arrays was in the spirit veins.</p><p>When drawing spirit veins, their thickness and depth, including the layout, all had a direct relationship with the actual formation of the array.</p><p>Regarding that point…</p><p>Weaving Expertise had it.</p><p>As the spirit needles danced in the air, Xu Xiaoshou used his spiritual source and condensed them into spirit threads.</p><p>At this point, these spirit threads had replaced spirit veins.</p><p>The thickness of the thread, its outline, the interactions between threads, and their attraction and repulsion, were all within Xu Xiaoshou’s mind.</p><p>This was only the most basic study of the Weaving Technique in Weaving Expertise.</p><p>As he swayed according to his mood, Xu Xiaoshou slowly realized that his thoughts and ideas might become reality.</p><p>Using the air as his array wheel, Xu Xiaoshou threaded his spirit needles and weaved a beautiful pattern.</p><p>The pattern started to develop and become more structured. If there was a Spirit Array Caster present, that person would shockingly realize that…</p><p>This pattern was actually a basic spirit-gathering array.</p><p>Beads of sweat rolled down Xu Xiaoshou’s forehead. He completed his last weave without even shifting his gaze.</p><p>Hum…</p><p>The spirit-gathering array in the air did not explode or become damaged like the Qingming Celestial Rock when it was being carved. After a hum, it started to shake and vibrate.</p><p>‘Is it working?’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was in a daze. He had never thought that a random passing thought would work.</p><p>He replaced the peaceful and prosperous family pattern within the Weaving Expertise into the spirit-gathering array and successfully weaved it.</p><p>At this point, he was over the moon.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou examined the sight in front of him. After the array was formed, it finally overcame the period of instability and shone brightly with brilliance.</p><p>Foosh… Foosh… Foosh…</p><p>Since Yuan Mansion was a small, tight place, he was able to feel the power and intensity of this spirit array even more.</p><p>As the rich and surging aura of vitality gathered, it was as if a storm had met a black hole and was pulled straight toward it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s clothes were almost ripped off his body.</p><p>This young man, who had found hope in despair, was tearing up profusely at this point.</p><p>‘Hard work will always be rewarded!’</p><p>For the third time, he sat on the ground with a plop. It was caused by the fact that his spiritual source had been used up.</p><p>More so, it was from the fact that…</p><p>‘If I had already found the entrance to spirit arrays, I wouldn’t have to worry about not being able to become a spirit array master anymore, right?’</p><p>‘Weaving Technique…’</p><p>‘So what if it was weaving technique? I can still make things work!’</p><p>The edge of Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth twitched.</p><p>“Ah-ha!”</p><p>He could not hold it in any longer.</p><p>“Oh-ho!”</p><p>He sprawled on the ground with his hands on his stomach, as he let out a crazy bout of laughter.</p><p>“He-he, ha-ha, ha-he, ha-ha…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
