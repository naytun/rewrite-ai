Yet, this young man claimed that it was merely a normal process of making the magic pills.</p><p>It was not so incredible if he had just talked about it.</p><p>Having said that, Xu Xiaoshou had somehow pulled out a magic pill from the stove’s debris.</p><p>Shi Ti was frozen like a wooden chicken.</p><p>He stared at the magic pill in Xu Xiaoshou’s hand in a daze. He raised his eyes to check the young man’s face.</p><p>“Are you kidding me?”</p><p>“I’m not. This is really a magic pill I’ve just made.” Xu Xiaoshou showed a serious expression on his face. “As I said, what I’ve just gone through is the normal process of making magic pills.”</p><p>Shi Ti took the magic pill in his hand and sniffed it, which was his subconscious behavior.</p><p>Without this subconscious behavior, he could easily figure it out simply by feeling the temperature of the magic pill and smelling its medicinal fragrance.</p><p>He could tell it this was a magic pill that had just come out of the stove.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hadn’t lied.</p><p>But…</p><p>He raised his head sluggishly and swept the crowd of onlookers with his gaze.</p><p>He had just scolded and yelled at the young man, and he hadn’t done something like that for decades. ‘Am I in the wrong?’</p><p>If he told this thought to others, questioning why he got so upset, his respect as a master president would have been lost.</p><p>This magic pill seemed to be something else rather than a Red Gold Pill. It was more like a slap on his face. Shi Ti felt like his face had been slapped unmercifully.</p><p>Shi Ti returned to his senses.</p><p>He recalled the letter from Old Man Sang.</p><p>“Forgiveness is a virtue.”</p><p>“Generosity reflects one’s civilization level.”</p><p>“Ahem!” Shi Ti started to cough violently by covering his chest with his hand.</p><p>Everyone looked at the president, who was hunched over.</p><p>He gazed at the magic pill in his hand.</p><p>At first, the expressions on everyone’s faces were incredulous. Even though some of them, such as Shi Ti, had the ability to perceive the magic pills, they still felt this was unbelievable.</p><p>Judging by the reaction on the president’s face, it was plainly obvious.</p><p>“Is this really a freshly made magic pill?” Fu Yinhong asked hesitantly. She approached the president and took the Red Gold Pill from his hand.</p><p>It felt warm and smelled fragrant.</p><p>She felt like her soul had been pugnaciously assaulted.</p><p>“How is this possible?”</p><p>Was it possible for someone to achieve this in the blasted stove?</p><p>No.</p><p>It dawned on Fu Yinhong that nobody had believed Xu Xiaoshou ever since he started talking.</p><p>Though his words sounded rather outrageous, what he said seemed to be mostly true when she thought of it in retrospect.</p><p>“Did you really make this magic pill by the means of the normal process of making magic pills?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled bitterly. “If there is an abnormal process of making magic pills, can you teach me how to do it?”</p><p>Everyone fell silent.</p><p>After a long time, an uproar finally resounded in the hall.</p><p>“How is this possible? I don’t believe it for a million years. Maybe he pulled this Red Gold Pill from his ring!”</p><p>“Was it pulled out? How can one imitate the medicinal fragrance and the temperature?”</p><p>“Adding heat… Yes, one can definitely use one’s spiritual source from the fire system to add heat to the magic pill in an instant.”</p><p>“What about the medicinal fragrance? Didn’t you smell the faint scorching odor hidden in the medicinal fragrance?”</p><p>“I’m not smelling it.”</p><p>“There is no need to smell it now. It has been gone a while. You could only smell it the moment the magic pill came out of the stove. Your cultivation level is not high enough to smell it. I believe all the top magic pill technicians can smell it with ease.”</p><p>“Are you belittling me?”</p><p>“If you don’t believe me, you can ask the president to confirm it.”</p><p>Hearing this, everybody focused their attention on Shi Ti again.</p><p>At the moment, Shi Ti was still hunched over and immersed in the painful thoughts.</p><p>‘The Red Gold Pill is real…’</p><p>As such, his earlier roar, his magic pill room, his Magic Pill Pagoda…</p><p>All of that had become insignificant.</p><p>‘What have I done, and what do I have to do?’</p><p>Shi Ti found that his mind was blank. He was too angry.</p><p>By the time his anger reached an extreme extent, he felt like a bucket of cold water had been poured over his head as he was about to vent his anger. He felt a chill from his body to his soul all at once.</p><p>“Ugh.”</p><p>The old man couldn’t help but sigh. The crowd noticed that Shi Ti’s expression was full of frustration.</p><p>The blow to his esteem was really a bit too much.</p><p>“Where’s old Yun?”</p><p>“We’ll ask him when he wakes up.”</p><p>Someone loudly made that suggestion.</p><p>Even though it looked and smelled very real, the Red Gold Pill still needed to be confirmed by a witness.</p><p>However, the eyewitness, at the moment, was still a bloody, unconscious man.</p><p>Shi Ti shook once when he heard the suggestion with his eyes beaming. He ran his hand over Yun He lightly. As a result, Yun He woke up after twitching his eyelids a few times.</p><p>“What did you see?”</p><p>The president’s voice was trembling.</p><p>He wanted to get a negative answer from Yun He, which would give him a good reason to vent his anger. He would also have a sufficient reason to kick the lad out of the Pill Pagoda.</p><p>Yun He looked at Shi Ti. He suddenly turned his head around to look at Xu Xiaoshou. He reached out his hand with trembling fingers.</p><p>“His…”</p><p>“Did he cheat?” asked someone nearby eagerly.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Yun He struggled to free himself from the hands of the person holding him. His face was full of excitement. “His method… I’ve never seen such a method of making the magic pills. It is a remarkable method!”</p><p>Shi Ti’s face turned pale.</p><p>Yun He was screaming and jumping. He had no concern for his image at the moment.</p><p>“This lad could refine the medicinal liquid in such a quick way.”</p><p>“The method is really awesome, which I have never seen before. He flipped and turned the medicinal ingredients like he was frying vegetables. Soon, the magic pill was ready.”</p><p>“There was also a technique of gathering the spirit back into the flow to collect the juice. This little brother described the technique so vividly and properly. It really was like collecting the juice!”</p><p>“It is a bold attempt to use the cooking method to gather the medicinal properties under the premise of precise manipulation of the fire. It’s simply the idea of a genius!”</p><p>“Also, as for the method of condensing pills, if I’m not mistaken…”</p><p>“Yun He!” Shi Ti shouted loudly.</p><p>His face turned dark green, which was the worst color when one was extremely angry.</p><p>He had woken Yun He up in hopes that the man could help him disprove the magic pill made by Xu Xiaoshou. What did he mean by saying all of this?</p><p>‘Frying vegetables?’</p><p>‘Collecting juice?’</p><p>‘What the heck? Can you say something sensible?’</p><p>‘We are talking about making magic pills, not about cooking!’</p><p>“You, calm down!” Shi Ti yelled.</p><p>Immediately, Yun He came back to his senses from the exhilaration state. He was on the verge of crying when he saw the looks on the crowd. Everyone must have thought he was an imbecile.</p><p>It was not long ago that he was the one who had looked at Xu Xiaoshou making the magic pill with the same expression on his face.</p><p>However, it turned out that they were wrong, and everyone was fooled.</p><p>In other words, they were not fooled, but they were close-minded because of their subjective thinking of inertia.</p><p>‘This Xu Xiaoshou is really capable!’</p><p>“I’m only asking you…” Shi Ti took a breath and asked with trembling lips, “Is it true that Xu Xiaoshou just made this magic pill?”</p><p>Yun He glanced at the young man, who stood silently on the side.</p><p>The young man shrugged his shoulders carelessly. It seemed that the young man didn’t care so much about what he would say.</p><p>“Master President, you have truly misunderstood him.”</p><p>“Though this lad is sometimes careless and has seriously injured me with the blast, frankly speaking, as for his method of making the magic pills…”</p><p>Yun He said with fire in his eyes, “I completely approve.”</p><p>Everyone was surprised at the affirmative tone of Yun He’s voice, wondering how someone who had almost died supported the culprit after waking up. What kind of strength did this young man have?</p><p>Shi Ti was also dumbfounded.</p><p>He looked down at the magic pill and closed his eyes tightly.</p><p>“If everyone still needs an affirmative answer…”</p><p>Yun He looked at the crowd and categorically said, “This magic pill was indeed made by Xu Xiaoshou!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
