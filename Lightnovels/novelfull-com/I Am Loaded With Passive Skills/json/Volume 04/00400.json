He was just unsure if the things that he saw using Weaving Expertise would contradict its original powers.</p><p>Even if he was uncertain, it was still worth a try.</p><p>Mu Zixi was still trapped inside. He had to save her.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoji heard that, he snickered to himself uncontrollably but did not dare show it.</p><p>“If that is the case, does it mean that you have deciphered this array wheel and can enter it to bring the things inside of it out?” He looked at him in surprise.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head.</p><p>“There is the possibility, but it is still lacking something.”</p><p>He pointed at the sword slot and said, “Just now, I examined the center point of the array veins and realized that they all congregated to this sword slot.”</p><p>“It was something that was thrust into it in the later stages, but it could assimilate with the Divine Secret, turning into a part of the array veins that is inseparable.”</p><p>“To activate this Cardinal Wheel, the original sword has to be found. It might be the Fourth Sword, or it might be something else…”</p><p>Hearing all of this, Xu Xiaoji was lost, he did not really understand and asked, “Do we have that?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s lips curled. “But we have you.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoji was surprised.</p><p>He immediately understood what he meant.</p><p>“Do you mean that you want me to turn into this sword and stab myself onto this array wheel?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled as he nodded.</p><p>“Are you kidding me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoji was instantly afraid.</p><p>The prowess of this Divine Array was not to be joked around with.</p><p>It was something that had to do with the power from the heavens. One careless mistake could make it explode with blasts more terrifying than that of the explosion of the sea of flowers.</p><p>Would randomly stabbing himself into the slot even successfully help in acting as a bridge of communication for this Divine Array?</p><p>Come to think of it, the bigger possibility was that he would become the bridge leading himself to his death.</p><p>“I can’t… I can’t do it! I don’t believe in it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoji retreated in shock.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stepped forward and solemnly held onto his shoulders.</p><p>“Trust me.”</p><p>Cursed, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Resented, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Feared, Passive Points +1.</p><p>This grab led to three notifications popping up.</p><p>Xu Xiaoji almost wanted to go insane.</p><p>“How do you expect me to trust you? You just said that it was just a possibility.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a while before he said, “You heard wrong. I said that it was definitely possible.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoji’s face turned green. His legs felt like jelly, so he almost fell.</p><p>Cursed, Passive Points +1.</p><p>He clenched his teeth tightly and struggled to ask, “If it fails, what will happen to me?”</p><p>“It won’t fail.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stated with confidence.</p><p>With a “plop,” Xu Xiaoji sat on the ground. His face was as pale as a sheet.</p><p>He looked at the young man in front of him as if he was looking at a demon smiling at him from the abyss.</p><p>The demon was saying, “Come on, jump down. You won’t die. My embrace is heaven.”</p><p>Was that believable at all?</p><p>Only a fool would believe it.</p><p>‘Could you at least respect my life?’</p><p>‘At the very least, this name was given to me by you!’</p><p>‘Everyone should be free and treated equally and with respect!’</p><p>“Time to transform… There’s no time.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou mercilessly waved his hand, breaking Xu Xiaoji’s train of thought.</p><p>Cursed, Passive Points +1.</p><p>“No, I won’t transform. I don’t want to die yet!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoji continued to struggle with the situation.</p><p>“I see how it is.”</p><p>With that, Xu Xiaoshou turned his head reluctantly and looked at Aje, who was eating a melon.</p><p>“Kill him.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoji was shocked.</p><p>“I will transform!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoji’s exclamation contained his humiliation and devastation from Aje’s treatment.</p><p>“How… How should I transform?” he asked shakingly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed. “Examine this sword slot and transform into whatever you think is suitable.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, I will be watching at the back.”</p><p>“Don’t panic. This is not a big problem.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoji’s lips twitched. He was so furious that his blood felt like it was boiling.</p><p>His body trembled as he glanced at the sword slot without taking a second look.</p><p>With a turn, he transformed into a sword.</p><p>It was a black sword with a narrow tip.</p><p>The body of the sword looked nice had some element of elegance. There were some bronze veins carved on it, but it was overall dull.</p><p>After all, the sword kept trembling, giving it a very cheap and common look.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>Such a lively person had just transformed into a sword.</p><p>This was an interesting development.</p><p>The world certainly was very interesting.</p><p>What kind of body composition did he possess to be able to have such an ability?</p><p>Furthermore, there did not seem to be spiritual source activations at all.</p><p>“As expected, he is not a human!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou exclaimed his fascination as he casually grabbed the sword hilt.</p><p>“Be more gentle.”</p><p>This sound of resistance caused Xu Xiaoshou to be stunned.</p><p>“This fella…”</p><p>He did not reply. He was about to insert the transformed Xu Xiaoji into the sword slot when there was another sound of resistance.</p><p>“Slow… Slowly.”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“Will I really be okay?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s brows twitched as he examined the sword in his hand.</p><p>“I couldn’t tell that you were so afraid of death. Don’t worry. I told you that you have me around to back you up!”</p><p>The sword was silent for a while before it said a simple but philosophical sentence.</p><p>“Being alive is quite nice.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded. He was at least 70% percent confident. If he wasn’t, he would not have let Xu Xiaoji take this risk.</p><p>As for whether it would be successful or not… Whether him being a sword would allow for successful communication with the Divine Array Veins…</p><p>Regarding this, the remaining percentage that depended on fate was important as well.</p><p>Not entertaining Xu Xiaoji’s resistance any longer, Xu Xiaoshou inserted the sword into the slot.</p><p>With this, the Cardinal Wheel seemed to have been attacked as the array veins lit up.</p><p>With a humming sound, the spiritual energy within Yuan Mansion was rapidly sucked dry along with the rich vitality.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately released his hold and took a step back.</p><p>“Has it been activated?”</p><p>That array vein was actually activated by the sword.</p><p>The communication with the Way of the Heavens was complete, but the rules in Yuan Mansion were not complete. Thus, the Divine Array Vein could only absorb that much energy.</p><p>The bright light that shone swam like a snake, slithering around before finally gathering on top of the sword slot.</p><p>When all of the light had entered the body of the sword, the Ji Sword suddenly stood up tall and straight. A sound of exhaling cold breath could be heard.</p><p>Right after that, there was a roar of pain.</p><p>“F*ck, Xu Xiaoshou, save me!”</p><p>“Pull me out quickly! Pull me out! It hurts!”</p><p>“This energy… I can’t take it anymore! They are all coming into me! F*ck! F*ck!”</p><p>“I… I am going to explode! Ahhh!”</p><p>Miserable cries could be heard echoing in Yuan Mansion. It shocked the fish in the spiritual pond so much that they stopped jumping around.</p><p>Aje tilted its head as it looked with great interest at this spirit case that could scream.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately went forward and grabbed ahold of the sword hilt.</p><p>“That’s right, pull me out quickly!” Xu Xiaoji cried both excitedly and painfully.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stood rooted to the spot.</p><p>He grabbed the sword hilt and held on.</p><p>The air was silent for a second.</p><p>Xu Xiaoji was confused.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>Suspected, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath as he felt that surging and frightening amount of energy enter his body from the body of the sword, bringing him pain.</p><p>He did not pull out the sword. Instead, he softly consoled it.</p><p>“Do not panic. It will all be over in a while.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
