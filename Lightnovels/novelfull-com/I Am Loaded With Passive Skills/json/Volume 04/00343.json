If they were to continue, the inn would not allow that.</p><p>Once they drew out their swords in battle, it would be hard to stop.</p><p>The two sides were just involved in a verbal quarrel, so it was not necessary to let events develop to this degree.</p><p>Moreover, the passive defenses that Xu Xiaoshou had displayed were even more self-explanatory. The fact that it could send Gu Qingsan’s Supreme Sword Body flying said plenty.</p><p>The person before him was a strong physique cultivator.</p><p>His rippling muscles were a dead giveaway. Logically speaking, he could not possibly have anything to do with swordsmen.</p><p>Sword cognition?</p><p>Naturally, it was even more inconceivable.</p><p>“I apologize for disturbing you today. This is a little token from our senior brother. I hope you can forgive us.”</p><p>As Gu Qingyi spoke, he took out a spatial ring and handed it over.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not move. After some thought, he did not refute further and accepted the spatial ring.</p><p>“Okay, I forgive you.”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Gu Qingsan’s temper rose again, but his second senior brother hurriedly held him back.</p><p>The elder senior had every intention of settling the dispute, so how could he let his junior brother continue to make a scene?</p><p>At the outset, he already felt that this fight was very unnecessary.</p><p>“Farewell.”</p><p>Gu Qingyi nodded and left with his two junior brothers.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou touched the spatial ring on his hand and got lost in thought as he stared at their backs.</p><p>Based on his original intention, they would not break into a fight today.</p><p>He had also not expected this senior brother to behave so politely and was surprised by how he reacted.</p><p>His motives were similar to Gu Qingyi’s, and he wanted to test the waters to get an idea of their abilities.</p><p>He took advantage of them when they were in search of the sword cognition. He intended to test the strength of these three people by making a scene and behaving unreasonably.</p><p>Why did these guys with famed swords come, and what were they after? Xu Xiaoshou had an inkling in his heart.</p><p>“White Cave?”</p><p>He frowned and returned to his room.</p><p>As time went by, it seemed that all kinds of news about White Cave were progressively emerging.</p><p>He also guessed that Jiao Tangtang and Xin Gugu were also after the White Cave, but their purpose was to search for a ghost beast host body like Mo Mo.</p><p>On the other hand, these three swordsmen were clearly after the Fourth Sword.</p><p>No matter what they were after, it was clear to him that this was just the beginning.</p><p>There was still some time before White Cave was unsealed.</p><p>He figured that there would be similar occurrences like this to encounter in the future.</p><p>‘This gives me a headache…’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou touched his head and laid on his bed in deep thought. He had the opportunity to see his opponents and witness their abilities even before White Cave unsealed itself.</p><p>Master swordsmen, famed swords…</p><p>‘No, I must not let Xin Gugu go!’ he secretly promised himself.</p><p>…</p><p>Tiansang City, Nantian Street…</p><p>This was a prosperous area in the city. The people who lived on this street were rich or of noble lineage. They were all the notable figures in Tiansang City.</p><p>At the end of Nantian Street was the famous City Lord Mansion.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never seen it before, but the number of black-armored City Guards he had seen along the way had already blown him away.</p><p>“The security level is really something.” He sighed with a tsk.</p><p>Xin Gugu led the way and asked, “Isn’t this what you said? Since it must be concealed but also capable of preventing assassinations, it can only be here.”</p><p>“This place is too close to the City Lord Mansion. If anything goes amiss, the City Guards will be able to arrive in time.”</p><p>“If a Sovereign Stage attacks, it is likely that someone from the City Lord Mansion will catch them before they can even make a move.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded in satisfaction.</p><p>“Only, it costs plenty of spirit crystals…” Xin Gugu looked up and stole a glance at the young man beside him.</p><p>“It’s nothing.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand generously. Even if he ran out of money, he was not afraid.</p><p>As long as Xin Gugu could stay with him, he was happy to let him set the terms.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what exactly did you buy?” Mu Zixi asked curiously from his side.</p><p>Along the way, the number of passersby reduced significantly, but the class of these people had improved by more than one grade.</p><p>Everyone they met along the way had bulging bellies, and they looked like they were very well-to-do.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled cheerfully without explaining.</p><p>“We are here.”</p><p>Very quickly, the three of them stopped.</p><p>Before their eyes was a magnificent small manor, complete with shady and lush spirit trees. One could feel the exquisite charm of this place even before setting foot inside.</p><p>“From now on, this will be our new home!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s spirited laughter reverberated in the air. He slapped his palm on the girl’s head and lifted his other hand, wanting to slap it too.</p><p>It quickly occurred to him that Xin Gugu was a Sovereign Stage, and this action would be rather abrupt. He ended up patting Xin Gugu’s shoulder lightly.</p><p>“Home?”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s eyes glittered with meaning. Her face darkened as if she was stirred by emotions unbeknownst to others.</p><p>She shook her head quickly and asked in surprise, “Xu Xiaoshou, are you crazy? We are only staying here for a few days, and we will have to return to the Spirit Palace soon. You bought a manor?”</p><p>“How much did it cost…”</p><p>The little girl’s lips parted slightly in disbelief.</p><p>“What do you know?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou flicked her forehead. “This is a necessity for cultivation. Every time I cultivate, I must compensate the inn so much. Can any normal person tolerate this?”</p><p>The thought of the money he had spent on compensation still pained him.</p><p>That event during the day cost him more than 100,000 spirit crystals.</p><p>If that occurred each time he was cultivating, would he end up having to pay millions if he stayed in this city for more than ten days?</p><p>That amount was enough to buy a small manor.</p><p>Xin Gugu ignored the squabbling pair.</p><p>He could not help feeling a little emotional. After all, he had completed the transaction of this new home himself. He was eager to launch the protective barrier with the command token in his hand.</p><p>As he walked to the gate, the stupor and disbelief that struck him gradually abated.</p><p>Although he had completed this transaction himself, the money came from Xu Xiaoshou’s pockets.</p><p>It would be more appropriate for the owner to complete the opening ceremony by himself.</p><p>“Go on!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou urged him with an encouraging smile.</p><p>Half of the reason behind his purchase of this manor was because of Xin Gugu. This guy needed to do the honors and conduct the opening ceremony himself to develop a stronger sense of belonging.</p><p>Xin Gugu raised a brow, but he did not object.</p><p>As soon as he imprinted the command token, the Array Guarding Barrier flickered and the door opened wide.</p><p>The three of them could barely contain their excitement as they stepped into the compounds.</p><p>The manor was vast and expansive. It was as different as day and night when contrasted against the crude facilities in the Spirit Palace.</p><p>Spiritual flowers and plants filled the courtyard, each of them teeming with spiritual energy. The species in the garden were extraordinary and rare.</p><p>Yet, the most eye-catching ones were the sporadic spirit trees. It seemed that the planting orientation of the spirit trees followed a particular array principle, which harnessed plenty of spiritual strength.</p><p>Although not as good as the Inner Yard, the concentration of spiritual energy of the heavens and earth here was much stronger than that in the Outer Yard.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the little girl ran out happily. A moment before, she had complained about Xu Xiaoshou squandering his wealth away. In the next second, she fell in love with this stately manor.</p><p>Xin Gugu glanced at his surroundings with contentment. Previously, he had only seen the beautiful scenery of the manor in the jade scroll before he bought it without a second thought.</p><p>Now that he was here in person, the lush environment indeed met his liking.</p><p>“So, this is a home…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also had a broad smile on his face, but his thoughts were elsewhere.</p><p>He retrieved a gold gilded invitation card and glanced at the date. The event would partake tomorrow night.</p><p>“Xin Gugu.”</p><p>“Hmm?” Xin Gugu turned to look at him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved the invitation card in his hand and asked, “Do you want to enter the City Lord Mansion for fun? If everything goes well, it should be entertaining.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
