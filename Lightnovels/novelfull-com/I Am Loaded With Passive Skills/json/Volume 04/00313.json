Moreover, they also would not exchange more than 10 words.</p><p>As the young master of the City Lord’s Mansion, he was talented in spiritual cultivation and swordsmanship.</p><p>Not only was he proficient in the way of manipulation, but he also knew how to accomplish his own objectives by dealing with people.</p><p>As long as he could speak and the other party was not mute, he was sure he would be able to dig out 10 Sections of the Finger Sword.</p><p>“Big Brother, Big Brother Shou, you have misunderstood me. I didn’t come to ask for 10 Sections of the Finger Sword,” Fu Xing said with a smile plastered on his face.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help taking a step back and asking, “If it’s not for the finger sword, then what do you want? If you do not want my money, do you intend to take my virtue?”</p><p>Fu Xing was speechless.</p><p>His virtue?</p><p>Was he that kind of person?</p><p>“No, I’m not interested in Big Brother Shou… Well, to be honest, perhaps I am a little interested…”</p><p>Fu Xing touched his chin and suddenly noticed that Xu Xiaoshou’s expression was frozen. He hurriedly explained, “No, no, no, Big Brother Shou misunderstood, I didn’t mean that.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wrapped his arms around his chest and stared at him vigilantly. “Then, what do you mean?”</p><p>“That is…”</p><p>Fu Xing twitched the corner of his mouth and decided to abandon the topic.</p><p>This guy… He was almost side-tracked again, but business first.</p><p>“I’m here to give you a golden opportunity,” Fu Xing said seriously.</p><p>“A golden opportunity?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned. He reached out and probed Fu Xing’s forehead with his hand. “Are you serious?”</p><p>Fu Xing said with a smile, “Naturally, I am serious.”</p><p>“His temperature seems fine…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou murmured, suddenly pointing at the cracked seventh floor of the Pill Pagoda. He asked, “Do you believe that the Pill Pagoda will drop an alchemy cauldron for no reason?”</p><p>Fu Xing was taken aback.</p><p>The conversation had veered.</p><p>‘As long as Big Brother Shou starts a topic, I must continue it!’</p><p>“I believe it!”</p><p>Fu Xing answered firmly.</p><p>If he were asked this question last time, he would not believe it. He had changed his mind after witnessing such a tremendous blast.</p><p>Let alone an alchemy cauldron, if a person dropped from the Pill Pagoda, he would believe it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded and asked, “Do you believe that there is a Sovereign Pill in this alchemy cauldron?”</p><p>Fu Xing wasn’t sure what to say.</p><p>He hesitated this time.</p><p>Was it possible?</p><p>“I don’t believe it.”</p><p>Even if he were to flatter him, he had to understand the problem and the approach clearly. Otherwise, misplaced flattery could rub him up the wrong way.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded indifferently. This answer was within his expectations.</p><p>He waved his hand and said, “You also do not believe that good fortune will rain on you, yet you still come to me with an enticement.”</p><p>“A golden opportunity?”</p><p>“No one would offer a reward for nothing. I think you just want to kill me so you can inherit my finger sword!”</p><p>Fu Xing’s face turned green.</p><p>He did not expect that Xu Xiaoshou would be able to manipulate the conversation in this way. With a mournful look, he explained, “Big Brother, you really misunderstood me. The opportunity I came here to give you is only good, not bad.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou scoffed.</p><p>“Do you believe that the Sovereign Pill that falls from the sky is absolutely pure and poison-free?”</p><p>Fu Xing was speechless.</p><p>Cursed, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Fu Xing was about to cry in despair. “Big Brother, I am really not a Sovereign Pill, I am…”</p><p>“I never said that you were a magic pill!”</p><p>“I…” Fu Xing felt his chest hurting and forced himself to play along. He acknowledged that his level was no match for Xu Xiaoshou’s, and he had been led astray again.</p><p>“Big Brother, do you know about White Cave?”</p><p>He decided to get straight to the point.</p><p>He realized that if he were to bait the young man in front of him, he would be the one to suffer in the end.</p><p>“White Cave?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked this time.</p><p>The most recent time this term appeared was during his last conversation with Elder Sang.</p><p>From the moment he met Elder Sang during the Windcloud Competition in the Outer Yard of Tiansang Spirit Palace, he had been engulfed in the vortex of major events.</p><p>He was sinking in deeper and deeper. In his last conversation with Elder Sang, he inferred that the center of this vortex was the White Cave.</p><p>The invasion of the masked man, the trap Elder Sang had laid, the shocking change of Tianxuan Gate, the grey mist figure and the ghost beast, the past sword of the Eighth Sword Deity…</p><p>From just hearing their names, these were all major shocking events. Eventually, they all pointed in the same direction.</p><p>“White Cave…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou whispered and frowned.</p><p>To be honest, when he deduced those things, the horror in his heart was no less than Elder Sang’s shock at him.</p><p>He admittedly did not reveal too much about what he knew, even if he knew that White Cave was a place of great doom and peril and that Elder Sang might just send him there.</p><p>He raised his head and looked at Fu Xing.</p><p>“Does the golden opportunity you mentioned have something to do with White Cave?”</p><p>Fu Xing nodded, feeling smug in his heart.</p><p>Sure enough, anyone who knew the existence of White Cave could not be unmoved, even if it was Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had an urge to turn around and leave.</p><p>To be honest, if he could avoid the cause and effect of this, he would do his best to stay away.</p><p>But he thought of Elder Sang.</p><p>That lousy old man did things without explanation to outsiders. It was even more impossible for him to tell others his true thoughts beforehand…</p><p>Even if this person was his precious disciple.</p><p>Honestly, getting accurate information from him was very difficult.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou estimated that when he was about to enter White Cave, the old man would most likely give him a complete White Cave map and say to him, “It’s okay, just have fun.”</p><p>He would then try his best to detour away from the old man’s plans. Ultimately, he would still stupidly fall into the old man’s ploy.</p><p>Unknowingly and inexplicably, he would still want to complete all the missions by himself.</p><p>‘How scary!’</p><p>At this thought, Xu Xiaoshou’s heart shuddered.</p><p>This time, he had to take the initiative to approach White Cave to at least find out everything in advance so that he was sufficiently prepared for it.</p><p>“Tell me about your golden opportunity,” Xu Xiaoshou said calmly.</p><p>He was eager for information, but he could not possibly let Fu Xing know. Otherwise, this kid would have the upper hand.</p><p>He still recalled that this lad lusted after his 10 Sections of the Finger Sword.</p><p>‘He took the bait!’ Fu Xing watched Xu Xiaoshou’s reaction, and he was overjoyed in his heart.</p><p>He was well-versed in psychology, so how could he not see that Xu Xiaoshou was very interested in intelligence about White Cave?</p><p>Under this guy’s pretentiously calm demeanor, he had a strong desire to learn about White Cave.</p><p>‘As long as he wants it, I can give it to him. In the end, he will give me what I want!’</p><p>Fu Xing was overjoyed. On the surface, he remained collected and asked, “Big Brother, how much do you know about White Cave?”</p><p>“Not much,” Xu Xiaoshou answered directly.</p><p>“He-he, then you should at least know about the Fourth Sword that went viral recently, right?”</p><p>“I know a thing or two about it.”</p><p>“Huh…” Fu Xing rubbed his chin thoughtfully and looked at Xu Xiaoshou’s expression. He had guessed that he probably also knew the external news.</p><p>“Then, do you know that White Cave should be unsealed within 10 days to a fortnight?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
