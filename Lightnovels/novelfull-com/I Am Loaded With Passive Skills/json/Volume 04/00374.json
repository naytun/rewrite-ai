You can continue to be in a daze!”</p><p>He had finally settled the Way of Spirit Array. Xu Xiaoshou felt the huge rock in his heart soften. He felt great.</p><p>‘The next step is to level up this Weaving Expertise so I can create spirit arrays with a simple movement.’</p><p>‘If that’s the case, I can use Big Fire Ball and nest it within the array. When I encounter enemies, I can throw it at their faces.’</p><p>As he thought that, Xu Xiaoshou started drooling uncontrollably.</p><p>He had long wanted to be able to command this type of fighting style like a wealthy man throwing money at his enemies.</p><p>Previously, Lei Shuangxing’s uncountable treasures, as well as Fu Xing’s defense spiritual weapon, had left him speechless.</p><p>Now, he finally had a chance to become the type of person that he hated and found the most annoying.</p><p>“Woo-hoo!”</p><p>He called out with a trembling hand over his mouth. Xu Xiaoshou finally calmed down.</p><p>He looked at Yuan Mansion again.</p><p>He had exchanged 10 keys to get 10 consecutive draws. The first key had already gotten him Weaving Expertise.</p><p>Would the remaining keys give him something extra?</p><p>Did he lose out by exchanging so many keys?</p><p>That was not possible.</p><p>Perhaps with the nine keys, he could draw nine more skills.</p><p>‘Could it be possible that today is my lucky day?’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was very happy. He used up the remaining keys at once and looked at the notification board.</p><p>‘Nine? Nine thank yous?’</p><p>He took a step back.</p><p>‘Did I not even get a notification for one key?’</p><p>Feeling a big pouty, Xu Xiaoshou sucked in some air and was speechless.</p><p>Even though he knew this time he had already gotten more than its worth, the nine keys were still quite disappointing.</p><p>Passive Points: 26,944</p><p>It required 50,000 for the lucky draw and 10,000 to level up. Now, he was left with this little amount of Passive Points.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at High Spirits.</p><p>He had not paid much attention to this skill for a long time.</p><p>For this skill to not have been his focus of leveling up meant that it had been functioning well for him.</p><p>This time’s drawing of spiritual arrays using Weaving Expertise had completely used up his spiritual source.</p><p>This exposed two problems.</p><p>His cultivation level was not high enough, and its growth was not keeping up well.</p><p>‘Should I level up?’</p><p>‘No!’</p><p>Without much hesitation, Xu Xiaoshou put all of his skill points on Weaving Expertise.</p><p>He did not have to consider it at all.</p><p>As long as he could create array wheels, he could prepare lots of spiritual arrays beforehand.</p><p>As for High Spirits, he decided to temporarily use elixirs to get him through for now.</p><p>Under certain current circumstances, spiritual arrays were more important.</p><p>Weaving Expertise (Innate Level 1)</p><p>Weaving Expertise (Innate Level 6)</p><p>Following this change, a large amount of knowledge entered Xu Xiaoshou’s mind.</p><p>This time, not only did the simple Weaving Technique appear, but there was also more information on how to cultivate inner peace and resolve.</p><p>‘Multitask control, multiple needles weaving, controlling spirit finger, puppeteering…’</p><p>The more he looked, the more shocked he was.</p><p>Weaving Expertise encompassed many things.</p><p>To simply define it as the Way of Spirit Array was honestly degrading it.</p><p>Weaving seemed to be unimpressive and not comparable to a spiritual array at all.</p><p>But Weaving Expertise contained really strong and powerful attention cultivation.</p><p>The newly appeared multitask control, as well as multiple needles weaving skills, helped Xu Xiaoshou learn how to multitask efficiently.</p><p>Based on his memories, Xu Xiaoshou used his spiritual senses to summon hundreds of spirit needles in thin air.</p><p>“Move!”</p><p>With a simple command, the hundreds of spirit needles started to move. They all had their own designated paths. They instantly weaved a shape that resembled Aje.</p><p>“Ma Ma!”</p><p>Seeing itself being flashed across in the air, Aje was feeling a little excited and called out agitatedly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was even more agitated as he pat Aje on the shoulder.</p><p>“Look!”</p><p>“My hundreds of weaving needles… Ha-ha, it was still 10 needles a while ago!”</p><p>“This method of multitask control not only increased my efficiency by tenfold, but it also means that during battles, I could possibly create spiritual arrays in an instant!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes widened so much that they almost fell out of his head. He was so excited that his lips trembled.</p><p>Aje retracted its line of sight from the sky. Its eyes were red with excitement.</p><p>It looked at the hand Xu Xiaoshou had put on its shoulder. It seemed to understand the feeling of excitement and was about to release its own excitement.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Even with his Recoil and Toughness, Xu Xiaoshou was slapped and thrown deep into the ground by Aje.</p><p>The air was silent.</p><p>The young man crawled out from the pit. He coughed a little and took a deep breath of air.</p><p>“Naughty.”</p><p>He brushed the dirt off his butt. Without saying a word, light flashed as he retreated from Yuan Mansion.</p><p>‘Stupid Aje. I shall confine him in there for a few hours!’</p><p>‘Did you dare to slap your Ma Ma?’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was angry as he looked at his shattered shoulder bones, which had started to heal under his Eternal Vitality. He got on his bed to calm himself.</p><p>‘Weaving Expertise was too strong!’</p><p>‘It was so strong that using just spiritual arrays to define it is totally not appropriate!’</p><p>“If this Passive Skill were to be leveled up to the Master Level, the controlling spirit finger and puppeteering techniques might be able to shine and perform as well!’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought about the last scene he saw of that bright hand in the illusion. If he was not wrong, that was the controlling finger’s final form.</p><p>As for puppeteering…</p><p>‘That’s a little terrifying. Could it really be like what I saw that time?’</p><p>In the illusion, Xu Xiaoshou remembered that he had seen the Vitality Diagram of some giant race.</p><p>Based on the design of the giant’s diagram, he could predict the giant’s movement whenever he wanted to.</p><p>‘If I drew this design, would that mean I could control that giant’s actions like I was controlling a puppet?’</p><p>“Tsk!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took in a breath of cold air. It was too terrifying.</p><p>If he took into consideration the previous multiple needles weaving…</p><p>‘This means that once the battle starts, I just need to instantly perform weaving on the enemy, and the enemy will bound to become my puppet!’</p><p>‘With the way of weaving being able to control living things, won’t every being just be an ant?’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was deep in shock and could not recover for a long time.</p><p>Was he interested?</p><p>He was extremely interested.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he was very eager and hungry for it.</p><p>However, the Passive Points that he had now were not sufficient for his Weaving Expertise to attain that level.</p><p>‘I’ve got to get to work!’</p><p>Coming back to the starting point, Xu Xiaoshou’s head started to hurt.</p><p>Earning small amounts of Passive Points was easy, but to earn a large number of Passive Points within a short amount of time was definitely not an easy task at all.</p><p>Other than harming oneself like when he was at Black Cliff, he could only cause trouble in a large crowd of people to get their attention and judgment.</p><p>‘Is there another black cliff?’</p><p>The answer to this question was bound to be negative.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought about it as he took out a golden invitation, which was the City Lord Mansion’s banquet invitation letter.</p><p>As he looked at the invitation letter, the young man made sly laughing noises.</p><p>‘I can’t… I can’t remain low profile anymore!’</p><p>‘I want to do something big!’</p><p>‘I want to earn money!’</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
