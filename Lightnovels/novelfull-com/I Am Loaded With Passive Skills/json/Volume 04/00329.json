His eyes filled with anger and great amusement.</p><p>This fella was a tough cookie.</p><p>He was aware that could never do things the hard way when it came to people with such stubborn tempers.</p><p>The man reached toward Xu Xiaoshou’s eyelids and silently closed his eyes for him.</p><p>He had to do things in the hardest way possible.</p><p>“Well, since you promised, I also can’t do nothing as you pass.”</p><p>The scruffy-looking man sighed in resignation.</p><p>Death used to be a wonderful occurrence. Death had come easy in the past. Any small incident would have caused death. To be able to die was a form of release.</p><p>It was a shame that he could not die yet. Xu Xiaoshou was not at a stage where he could afford the luxury of death.</p><p>It was safe to say that his destiny had not even started yet.</p><p>The scruffy-looking man found his line of sight focused on the ancient text on the floor. With a wave of the hand, the palm-thick ancient text was turned into a stream of light that went straight into Xu Xiaoshou’s mind.</p><p>Suddenly, the corpse on the floor started to shiver.</p><p>His expressions were cramped as his body shook uncontrollably. He was close to foaming from his mouth. He moved as if he was struck by lightning.</p><p>For a corpse to have such a violent reaction to pain, it was frightening to imagine the impact this ray of light must have had on his mind.</p><p>“You should rest…”</p><p>After much hesitation, the man did not let him swallow the elixir he held in his hand.</p><p>To experience pain while sleeping was much more tolerable than withstanding the pain while awake.</p><p>He turned his palm over and restored the elixir. Pushing his hand, he passed through a wave of Sword Aura.</p><p>The Sword Aura entered the energy center with a slight shake before it had perfectly synced into the body of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>The shell of Xu Xiaoshou’s heavily wounded flesh body begun to sprout streams of sword cognition.</p><p>The sword cognition had exhausted the massive Sword Will and turned into a white fog.</p><p>The Sword Aura pulled together the flesh body and simultaneously triggered Xu Xiaoshou’s torn-apart body. It constantly tugged and assembled it.</p><p>Within moments, the majority of Xu Xiaoshou’s body had been healed.</p><p>A strong tide of life force surged from an unknown source and washed all over the body.</p><p>Cells were reproducing, nourishing, and growing the body as the flesh body began to rapidly recover.</p><p>The sudden change left the scruffy-looking man stunned.</p><p>‘What’s happening?’</p><p>‘This surge of life force… Where did it come from?’</p><p>‘Could it be that someone gave this fella a protective prohibition to prevent him from dying accidentally?’</p><p>‘Isn’t all that old fella knows how to do is blow his temper and run away from home?’</p><p>The scruffy-looking man was deep in thought. In this case, he could have saved the next Rejuvenation Pill.</p><p>If he gave this fella and his brimming life force the time, it would be possible for him to recover to the state he was at his peak.</p><p>‘For an Innate Origin Court Level fella like him to have this kind of life force, what would he become when he becomes a Sovereign?’</p><p>The uncle laughed bitterly.</p><p>For others, to live again was an occurrence worth celebrating.</p><p>For him, to remain alive despite the desire to die must have been the greatest pain in the world.</p><p>‘Such a burden of life force to carry at such a young age…’</p><p>‘Why am I worried? I should be celebrating on your behalf.’</p><p>The scruffy-looking man sighed faintly. He watched as Xu Xiaoshou’s convulsing body finally stood up.</p><p>He retrieved a sack from his ring and placed the twitching corpse inside. Fastening the knot, he casually tossed the sack aside.</p><p>Dong!</p><p>The ground shattered upon impact.</p><p>The man was stunned.</p><p>At this moment, a faint banging sound could be heard from afar.</p><p>The space barrier had been broken. A shocking number of black City Guards marched into the location and surrounded the area tightly.</p><p>Their leader by four Sovereigns.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>The guards maintained formation and charged forward with an overwhelming presence.</p><p>The audience of hundreds and thousands of rescued masses had retreated miles away.</p><p>Even in the aftermath, some of them were not petrified. Instead, they looked forward to the battle.</p><p>If it was not for the City Guards forming an obstruction line in the front, the hot-headed impatient individuals would have charged into the center of the battlefield.</p><p>“Look! What are those? Why are there are so many pits?”</p><p>“Pits? You must be blind. That is obviously a cliff!”</p><p>“I know this place. This was the shortest path to the Pill Pagoda. Tiansang City barely has any crowd, so how can there be any cliffs?”</p><p>“That’s true, but there’s no way a cliff a few miles in depth could be the result of a fight!”</p><p>“Oh, god, there might be a possibility it was from a fight. Could this be the power of Master Spiritual Cultivators?”</p><p>“Spiritual Cultivators…”</p><p>The masses watched the Master Spiritual Cultivators use their handcrafted tools from miles away.</p><p>Many Spiritual Cultivators lowered their heads silently.</p><p>The masses had been too kind to them.</p><p>No Spiritual Cultivators, including a Master Spiritual Cultivator, would be able to leave such a cliff in the defensive barriers of Tiansang City.</p><p>It would have taken a year to accomplish a feat such as this.</p><p>The quarreling crowd could only watch from afar, but those with the knowledge were aware that the battle was far from over.</p><p>Many wished to get closer to the center, but many knew that if they tried, there would be no escape. They would not have even know what killed them.</p><p>Xin Gugu squeezed by the crowd. He wore a frown on his face. His Golden Staff was particularly eye-catching.</p><p>However, in a situation as chaotic as it was, there was little attention paid to him.</p><p>The battle between Sovereigns was the heated topic of discussion of the moment.</p><p>“Am I late?”</p><p>In the past 10 minutes, he had rushed to the scene at the speed of lightning. He traveled so much that he almost figured out how to teleport between spaces.</p><p>All that rush had been in vain.</p><p>For someone of his caliber, he could easily tell the scene apart.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was alive and lying behind the scruffy-looking man. His body was well-hidden within the sack.</p><p>“Is this a kidnapping?”</p><p>Xin Gugu had never been this confused in his life.</p><p>Kidnapping aside, to bomb Tiansang City to this state was a little overboard.</p><p>Did they assume the City Guards to be a Buddha-level organization, one that would forgive in the face of the most atrocious crimes? What a joke.</p><p>Moving his sight to the ground, he spotted puddles of blood. The inside of one of the deep pits was scattered with colorful and differently shaped pieces of…</p><p>Was it pieces of flesh?</p><p>‘Was this a homicide?’</p><p>He was more confused than ever.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou was alive, then who did the corpse belong to?</p><p>He had lost track of any sense.</p><p>In this context, Xu Xiaoshou was a mere outsider in the battle.</p><p>After all, someone who was at a trivial Innate level was not able to engage in a battle with a Sovereign that resulted in this terrible aftermath.</p><p>Therefore…</p><p>Xin Gugu turned toward the scruffy-looking man who stood in front of the sack. Was it his doing?</p><p>‘But… How is it possible for someone his age to hit the peak?’</p><p>Xin Gugu felt as if his mind was about to blow. It was impossible to guess the truth of what had truly happened.</p><p>The weak and trivial status of Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t have a battle of this scale with a Sovereign. Yet, the only standing figure of the fight was him.</p><p>How could he make sense of this?</p><p>‘Don’t panic!’</p><p>“If the damned hag was here, she would certainly instruct me to wait and see what happens next. So, I better wait and see how things go!’</p><p>‘In the worst-case scenario…’</p><p>Xin Gugu poked the Golden Staff in his hand. His fingers tapped the body of the staff, which produced a steady rhythm. He started to count.</p><p>‘One, two…’</p><p>The City Guards had sent four Sovereigns.</p><p>There was one scruffy-looking man.</p><p>No, he changed the number of Sovereigns from four to five.</p><p>His pupils were glowing with a dangerous glimmer.</p><p>‘In the worst-case scenario, I could hastily and silently eliminate these five and take Xu Xiaoshou away!’</p><p>‘Greedy the Cat Spirit must not die!’</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
