Even if he had been bumped into to the extent that his shoulders bled, he did not make a single sound.</p><p>“Young man, you did not look properly while walking. Are you now blaming me?”</p><p>“Assassin?”</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>He laughed loudly as if amused. He used his hands, which were draped in dirty sleeves, to continually hit his leg. Tears were almost falling from his eyes.</p><p>Suspected, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Mocked, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at these two notifications and was instantly relieved.</p><p>This system couldn’t possibly be fake.</p><p>No matter how well this man might have been acting, he could not possibly bluff the system. Did that mean he really was just a passerby?</p><p>“Huu…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw him laughing and started to laugh himself.</p><p>He was so nervous that he did not realize that from the moment he stepped out of the door, his back was already wet.</p><p>“Sorry, I was distracted by my thoughts and bumped into you accidentally.”</p><p>The sloppy man straightened his sleeves, wiped his tears with the back of his hands, and shook his head. “Young man, do you know that if I were still young, you would have already been a dead man by now?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyebrows raised.</p><p>He looked at the man’s dirty neck. There was a huge scar as if he had been executed. Seeing that, he knew that this person might have been a tough one when he was younger.</p><p>Who didn’t have a dark, passionate past?</p><p>If not for the troubles in life, if not for him being beaten until he was disabled, as a cultivator, he would not have had to give up the way of spiritual cultivation and scavenge for scrap metal.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou eyed him again.</p><p>Acquired Stage…</p><p>His cultivation had been routed. It could be easily seen that his cultivation had most likely been forcibly dispersed by someone.</p><p>His face looked tough. He had ruthless features, but it is too dirty with oil and dirt. It looked as if he had not washed in a long time. There was a strong odor, and his facial features could not be seen clearly.</p><p>“I’m leaving.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou handed him a bottle of Red Gold Pills and did not say anything more as he brushed past him and left.</p><p>There was a huge boulder weighing down his heart. If he did not remove it, he would not be in the mood to joke around with any strangers to earn any Passive Points.</p><p>The sloppy man hoisted his sack over his shoulders and stared at the Red Gold Pills in his hands for a while before smiling.</p><p>He took two steps forward and called out, “You are walking in the wrong direction!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already disappeared in the sea of humans.</p><p>“Hai…”</p><p>“Young people are always so impulsive…”</p><p>…</p><p>The 10 minutes felt extremely long. The slow passage of time was wearing him out. The little incident on the street made Xu Xiaoshou even more annoyed.</p><p>He rotated his wrists. Sounds of clicking could be heard from his bones.</p><p>He paused for a moment.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly realized something was amiss.</p><p>Had he seen a sovereign but been too worried to notice? Was he still himself?</p><p>“Aje.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou squinted his eyes and called out softly.</p><p>However, there was no reaction.</p><p>Sss…</p><p>He was instantly covered in goosebumps from the bottom of his feet to the top of his head. Xu Xiaoshou felt chills everywhere.</p><p>His face turned green as he stabilized his steps and continued walking forward, trying to make himself seem normal.</p><p>‘It has already started…’</p><p>‘No, it started a while ago!’</p><p>‘That man… No. That’s not right. It was not that dirty man. From the moment I stepped out of that door, I had already been tricked!’</p><p>‘An illusion array?’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was undecided. He did not believe that this was an illusion array.</p><p>No matter how strong an illusion array was, it would trigger the system’s Hypnotized notification. This fact had already been confirmed when he was eavesdropping while Rao Yinyin left her bath.</p><p>If it was not an illusion array, how could he have been influenced?</p><p>Watched, Passive Points +1.</p><p>The Information Bar refreshed with a new notification. Xu Xiaoshou understood a little what was happening.</p><p>‘Sovereign…’</p><p>‘Power from the heavens?’</p><p>He suddenly stopped in his tracks.</p><p>At this point, he could already see that the direction he was heading seemed to be the same distance as the way toward the Pill Pagoda. Actually, it was totally different.</p><p>He had not managed to realize this at the beginning.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt disappointed in himself.</p><p>‘I was careless!’</p><p>‘Really careless!’</p><p>‘I should not have come out during the past 10 minutes!’</p><p>‘It would have been good even if I had just sat around in the inn. Why did my mind want me to come out?’</p><p>‘Even if Xin Gugu comes, he still needs time. I already know that this assassin is not ordinary, so why was I still so impulsive?’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou closed his eyes as he felt his heart fall into an abyss.</p><p>…</p><p>“Don’t blame yourself.”</p><p>A clear voice could be heard coming from the front.</p><p>A white-robed man wearing a red mask walked forward.</p><p>His arms were crossed in front of his chest. His fingers were slim and pale with neatly trimmed nails. He was spotless and had a refined temperament.</p><p>A red command token hung on his waist.</p><p>The symbols for the Three Incenses were carved into the token.</p><p>There was one red, one purple, and one dull green.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked with his eyes wide open as sorrow flashed across his eyes.</p><p>“As expected…”</p><p>He grabbed his communication jade device immediately and was going to call Jiao Tangtang. However, the man in front of him waved his hand, and the device disintegrated.</p><p>“Don’t be nervous. I’m just here to take your life.”</p><p>This voice sounded as if it came from the skies freely and simply.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s whole face turned green.</p><p>At this moment, he suddenly could understand what those guys who were always annoyed by him felt.</p><p>“Who are you? A Three Incenses assassin? Do you know Li Seven?” Xu Xiaoshou asked a series of questions.</p><p>He needed to stall for time.</p><p>This man was too strong.</p><p>Just one glance was enough for him to know that he was a being not below the likes of Xiao Qixiu or Ye Xiaotian.</p><p>It was not a guess. It was a fact.</p><p>He was definitely not weaker than the strongest Spiritual Cultivators back in the Spirit Palace.</p><p>An assassin from the Three Incenses, an organization totally of another level, could not be compared to the Dark Street organization that Li Seven came from.</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou looked at him, he felt it was similar to the first time he met Elder Sang.</p><p>That willful sense of indifference, not giving a care about anything… It was like someone who was used to being above all and having total authoritative power.</p><p>How could he defeat this type of person in his current state?</p><p>How could this type of person appeared at this stage in front of him?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was filled with despair.</p><p>…</p><p>“I am Red Dog. That’s what everyone calls me.”</p><p>The white-robed man took a step forward and immediately appeared beside Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>No matter how much the latter tried to retreat, he was always on to him as if he was a leech.</p><p>Red Dog was very tall, perhaps half a head taller than Xu Xiaoshou. He bent forward a little and said in his ear, “You are interesting.”</p><p>He tilted his head as if thinking of words to explain it.</p><p>“This is the first time I’ve heard of an Innate Spiritual Cultivator who was worth so much money. To be honest, the reason I accepted this mission was just to have a look at you.”</p><p>“But–”</p><p>His words stopped abruptly as he put away his curiosity. He indifferently said, “My kill rate does not allow anyone, including you, to cause it to drop from a hundred percent.”</p><p>“Do you understand what I’m saying?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
