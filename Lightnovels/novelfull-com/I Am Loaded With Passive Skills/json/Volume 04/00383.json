If one could use the money to kill people, that was the highest state.</p><p>As for Passive Points, the same was true.</p><p>He walked out of the banquet room without interruption, Mu Zixi trailing behind him. After turning one corner, their surroundings dimmed into the moonlight.</p><p>Shady trees surrounded the secluded roads. In the cold night breeze, some night pearls lit up the areas in front.</p><p>The deeper they went in, the darker it got.</p><p>In the end, even the light disappeared.</p><p>Mu Zixi felt her little heart starting to pound.</p><p>‘Where is he going?’</p><p>‘The grove?’</p><p>‘Wasn’t the grove in this direction?’</p><p>She did not know what was lying ahead of them, and Xu Xiaoshou also did not have a map. They were wandering around aimlessly. It seemed that he was actively avoiding every exit he encountered.</p><p>As the road turned east and west, Mu Zixi had lost her sense of direction.</p><p>“Xu, Xu Xiaoshou… Where are we going?”</p><p>There were only two of them there, and it was eerily quiet.</p><p>When Mu Zixi spoke, she felt that her heartbeat was louder than her voice.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou noticed that the little girl’s speech was rather strange, but he did not think much about it.</p><p>“We are digging a hole!”</p><p>“How can I bury people without digging a hole?”</p><p>Mu Zixi immediately felt her heart stop in her chest.</p><p>‘Digging… Digging holes and burying people?’</p><p>‘What does that mean?’</p><p>‘Digging holes is only for burying the dead.’</p><p>‘Could it be… He wants to… First…’</p><p>“Well, where is this place?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou interrupted her thoughts, which had wandered off course with a cry of surprise.</p><p>She looked in that direction and realized that the scenery had changed drastically before her eyes. In front of them was a colorful sea of flowers.</p><p>The floral fragrance wafted out, which made people feel invigorated. It was so refreshing that it seemed to blow away some evil thoughts.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little wonderstruck.</p><p>Mu Zixi had followed him all the way. Naturally, she was completely unaware that he had shattered many Restraining Arrays with Perception.</p><p>However, to practically apply the Weaving Expertise skill that he had learned in his mind…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not even use Perception afterward. He only relied on the All-Beings Diagram to infer the Array Shattering Methods.</p><p>The Innate Stage Restraining Array could not stop him at all.</p><p>He only used Perception and Weaving Expertise to shatter the first Master Stage Spiritual Array before a strange feeling came over him.</p><p>“Sea of flowers?”</p><p>“Is it possible that there are treasure burying grounds ahead?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up with excitement.</p><p>He did not know whether to bury the treasure or not, but it was very secluded here. Moreover, there was a Master Stage Spiritual Array as an additional deterrent. It was an excellent place to bury bones.</p><p>Zhang Taiying only needed to be lured there. Once he initiated the bounded domain, who could know that there was a battle here?</p><p>“Little Junior Sister, follow me. Don’t wander around.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou called out and stepped into the sea of flowers.</p><p>The sea of flowers was extremely tall. It almost hid his waist.</p><p>Of course, this was for Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>As far as Mu Zixi was concerned, she only had a tight feeling in her chest as she walked into the sea of flowers.</p><p>She only felt better when she flew a little higher.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Before her, Xu Xiaoshou trembled. He reached for her waist with his hand.</p><p>Mu Zixi was speechless.</p><p>The warm and ticklish feeling at her waist made her suddenly shrink back and retreat.</p><p>“What do you think you are doing?”</p><p>The girl blushed a deep red and squeaked.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou withdrew his hand in embarrassment. “Why are you flying so high?”</p><p>He had been focusing on the spiritual array and almost forgot about the girl behind him.</p><p>“Why can’t I fly high?” Mu Zixi raised her chin defiantly. “Is that a good reason for you to fondle me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>“Don’t play around and come down quickly.”</p><p>Mu Zixi flew higher and higher. She was about one head higher than him. He hurriedly persuaded her. “The spiritual array here seems to be a bit strange. It is not an ordinary Master Stage spiritual array. Don’t mess around first and wait until I investigate it.”</p><p>“How strange can it be…”</p><p>Before the girl could finish her sentence, her elevated body suddenly stagnated as though someone was dragging her down.</p><p>With a thud, she came into contact with the ground.</p><p>“Ouch… Oof!”</p><p>Her face was covered in mud.</p><p>“Pfft!” Xu Xiaoshou let out a laugh.</p><p>Looking at his little junior sister, who got up from the ground with a grudging expression on her face, he teased her and replied, “Yes, how strange can it be? It’s just a light fall…”</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Mu Zixi raised her fist to jump up and smack him. As a result, the spiritual array seemed to be triggered and adopted a keen sense.</p><p>As soon as she lifted her foot off the ground, the unknown force dragged her down again.</p><p>With another thudding sound, Mu Zixi felt her knees crash into the ground due to her instability.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly stepped forward to support her.</p><p>“No can do, no can do…”</p><p>Mu Zixi was speechless.</p><p>Cursed, Passive Points +1, +1, +1, +1…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou steadied the girl, whose little skirt was streaked with dirt. He began to think.</p><p>‘Is this an Impermeable Barrier?’</p><p>He was a little surprised.</p><p>The level of the Impermeable Barrier was not low at all.</p><p>When it came to the theories of space and limits, this level was far beyond the Great Path.</p><p>It was not an exaggeration to say that it was the power that the Sovereign Stage could possess.</p><p>However, the spiritual array here was only Master Stage.</p><p>This…</p><p>How was it done?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had his Weaving Expertise skill. If he could hold out his spiritual source for an extended period, he could draw a spider web in the void.</p><p>But the intangible and invisible were currently beyond his limits.</p><p>“This sea of flowers is a little strange!”</p><p>He recalled the time he was in the Back Mountain of the Tiansang Spirit Palace. When he first entered the spiritual site of Rao Yinyin, it was also a sea of flowers.</p><p>The difference was that they were all psychedelic Red magical poppies.</p><p>Now…</p><p>He had the same bad feeling about this place.</p><p>“Be careful.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned and cautioned Mu Zixi. He continued to move forward, stepping directly into the sea of flowers.</p><p>Mu Zixi frowned and looked at the dirty little skirt on her body. She wanted to change it immediately, but it was clearly inappropriate at this time.</p><p>Fortunately, as soon as she entered the sea of flowers, it had blocked everything. It was nice.</p><p>Except for the tightness in her chest…</p><p>While thinking about it, she suddenly saw Xu Xiaoshou in front of her. He was flying.</p><p>At this moment, the girl widened her eyes.</p><p>“!!!”</p><p>The two of them already had a massive height difference. When Xu Xiaoshou flew, Mu Zixi had to lift her head to the sky just to see him.</p><p>“It’s not fair! How can you fly?”</p><p>Doubted, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou coursed in the air leisurely, and his mutterings transmitted down from the sky.</p><p>“It’s not that I want to fly. It is the night sky… She’s calling out to me.”</p><p>Mu Zixi was speechless.</p><p>She managed to suppress her urge to attack him.</p><p>After all, if she jumped up, she would only fall to the ground.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked around curiously from above the sky.</p><p>The fact that he could fly in here was not because he could figure out the workings of the spiritual array.</p><p>It could be credited to his superior Passive Skills, which were a bit too powerful.</p><p>The Impermeable Barrier was strong, but it could not hold a candle to his Toughness and Strengthen skills.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was ecstatic that the spiritual array level here was only at the Master Stage. Otherwise, even if he had a Master Physique, he would not be able to fly in a peak Master Stage spiritual array.</p><p>But now…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was curious. Who could be behind this?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
