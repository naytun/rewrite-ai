As soon as it was quiet, his expression turned serious.</p><p>No matter how much Xin Gugu tried to reassure him, he could not relax as long he was alone in the room.</p><p>’10 minutes?’</p><p>‘Is Xin Gugu reliable?’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened the windows. The sun had started to set, so the sky had turned yellow.</p><p>He thought of the stranger who wanted to take his life.</p><p>The pressure he was feeling had become increasingly suffocating. It was as if he could collapse in the next second.</p><p>This feeling had lasted five days and was getting more intense.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that this could not continue any longer. Even if the assassin could wait, he could not.</p><p>The longer this dragged on, the more the assassin would find out about him.</p><p>For Xu Xiaoshou, there was bound to be a day when his last line of psychological defense would be broken.</p><p>‘Today is the day to settle him!’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou bit hard on his teeth with determination.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He pushed the door open and walked straight out.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Mu Zixi was at the doorstep. She had raised her hand, hesitating whether to knock.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s nervousness had diminished a little. “Do you have something to tell me?”</p><p>Mu Zixi hesitated for a while and asked, “Are, are you, going out?”</p><p>“What for?”</p><p>“For a stroll?”</p><p>The young lady twirled her ponytails and lifted her head with her gaze shifting. “Don’t you find it boring to always be stuck in the room?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment.</p><p>He had not thought of that before. He might be having a lot of fun by himself, but this young lady might not be.</p><p>It was already considered good enough if she could alchemize for a whole day. Asking her to do so for five days was too harsh for this active and bubbly girl.</p><p>“Now is not a good time.”</p><p>Nevertheless, he still shook his head and said, “I have a serious matter to settle. I have to head out for a while.”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s eyes lit up. “I want to go with you. You can settle your matter. I will just watch from the side and cheer you on!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought, ‘You really should not take part in this matter. It can only be settled by me alone.’</p><p>Whether he could make it back alive was still an unanswered question.</p><p>Touching the piece of black rock he was wearing, Xu Xiaoshou hardened his resolve and rejected her. “No.”</p><p>“I’m leaving.”</p><p>The young lady wanted to continue speaking, but Xu Xiaoshou had already left her behind, causing her to stomp the ground in anger.</p><p>“@￥%…”</p><p>Cursed, Passive Points +1, +1…</p><p>Stalked, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed.</p><p>He looked back and shoved the sneaky young lady back into the room.</p><p>Scolding her now might cause her to have the opposite reaction. Hence, Xu Xiaoshou gently said, “Be a good girl and wait for me to come back into the room. I will take you out to play tomorrow.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Initially, Mu Zixi wanted to resist. Once she heard such a gentle tone, she was stunned.</p><p>Was this person still Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>She glanced at the big palm on her forehead and was speechless.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took advantage of this lack of reaction by his junior sister and moved away.</p><p>Mu Zixi was speechless.</p><p>‘It’s so irritating! I got cheated again!’</p><p>‘How could Xu Xiaoshou be so gentle?’</p><p>“This senior brother is a tyrant!’</p><p>She clenched her fists tightly as her eyes widened.</p><p>“Tomorrow…”</p><p>Dong!</p><p>Mu Zixi laid on the big bed and bounced on it with her face looking like she had been wronged.</p><p>“Alone again. I don’t want this!”</p><p>…</p><p>In the evening…</p><p>“Selling biscuits… One for one shattered spirit crystal. Two for two shattered crystals…”</p><p>“Passersby, come have a look at newly sown spiritual ice silk clothes! They’re definitely clean, pristine, and high quality!”</p><p>“Elixirs! Elixirs! Red Gold Pill! Known as a second life for Spiritual Cultivators, it’s usually priced at 99 but is now only 59! As long as you have the spirit crystals, it is yours for the taking!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>On the street, such shouting and merchandise promotion were heard everywhere. The world of ordinary people and that of Spiritual Cultivators had perfectly integrated in Tiansang City.</p><p>Even if the sky was turning dark, the bustling city showed no signs of fatigue.</p><p>Everyone was still motivated and working hard for the sake of earning their livelihoods to make ends meet.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou squeezed through the crowd alone.</p><p>All the bustle belonged to the other people. In his current world, it had been solemn and grave as soon as he stepped out of that door.</p><p>Almost immediately after he stepped out of the inn, the Watched notification did not move anymore.</p><p>Different from the other notifications, which eventually got drowned out, once Xu Xiaoshou saw that one notification, he knew that that Watched would not disappear like the rest.</p><p>Instead, it was continually being executed.</p><p>‘He is watching me!’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his scalp tingle.</p><p>As he looked at the crowd around him, he felt some sense of relief.</p><p>Sovereigns could not attack without reason.</p><p>That was a mainland rule.</p><p>This was also the center of Tiansang City with lots of people walking by. The assassin would not risk doing anything there.</p><p>If he did, the guards or highly skilled cultivators from Tiansang City were enough to stop him.</p><p>Even so, Xu Xiaoshou was still feeling a lack of confidence.</p><p>‘Ten minutes… There are still 10 minutes before Xin Gugu arrives. I was too rushed. I should have stayed inside for a while longer.’</p><p>As he was thinking, Xu Xiaoshou walked through the crowd. At this point, he still did not dare to walk toward a place with fewer people.</p><p>To hide this fear, he purposely chose a target destination to walk toward.</p><p>It was the Pill Pagoda.</p><p>A 10-minute walk was enough for him to reach the Pill Pagoda.</p><p>‘Once Xin Gugu arrives, I can…’</p><p>Dong!</p><p>A deep sound could be heard. It was followed by the sound of a figure hitting the ground. The exclamations from the people around woke Xu Xiaoshou up from his thoughts.</p><p>He raised his head.</p><p>Not far away on the floor was a sloppy-looking man with long hair and a dirty body. He was dragging a big sack behind him, causing him to look like a trash collector.</p><p>At this time, he was humming and lying on the ground while holding his chest.</p><p>‘This is…’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had an awkward expression. Had he been too deep in thought and bumped into someone?</p><p>He was immediately apologetic and wanted to help the man up, but his hands suddenly stopped.</p><p>“Are you the assassin?”</p><p>His eyes suddenly looked cold as he picked grew alert and his body went cold.</p><p>“No, no, I’m not an assassin!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had been paying attention to the notification board. If this was the assassin, there should have been a notification of Ambushed appearing.</p><p>This was merely a passerby who he had bumped into when he was nervously in deep thought.</p><p>“I am sorry.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou helped the man up, not worrying about all the filth.</p><p>He pulled the sack on the ground over and wanted to pass it back to the man.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>He heard the sound of metal clashing.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>It sounded like scrap metal, which suited this uncle’s identity. With Xu Xiaoshou’s perception, he thought it sounded more like a bunch of weapons.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou decided to be direct again.</p><p>“Sir, are you an assassin?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
