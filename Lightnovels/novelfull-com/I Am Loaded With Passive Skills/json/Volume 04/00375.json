It was as if Doctor Strange was conducting laboratory experiments.</p><p>In the room…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou put down the Qingming Celestial Rock shard in frustration.</p><p>“It still doesn’t work!”</p><p>The difficulty level of making the Blank Array Wheel was beyond Xu Xiaoshou’s expectations.</p><p>It was an unfathomable feat for an Innate Stage Spirit Array Caster.</p><p>In the Way of Spirit Array, this kind of self-made freestyle array wheel could not benefit from any spiritual technique. It was simply too difficult to master.</p><p>There was no way to get started without at least a Master Stage cultivation level.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was currently only at level six of the Innate Stage for his Weaving Expertise skill. Yet, for most of the spiritual arrays, it was already possible to manipulate them.</p><p>Given time, he could work out the mechanics of the Master Stage spiritual array because of the precise and extensive knowledge he had in his mind.</p><p>When it came to the Blank Array Wheel…</p><p>It was impossible.</p><p>‘Can I comprehend it only when I get to the Master Stage?’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the Qingming Celestial Rock shard on the table.</p><p>He created his own Weaving Technique out of thin air, but the spiritual array depended on a physical object.</p><p>Of course, there were some things in common between the two.</p><p>If he were honest, there was a big difference between skills conjured out of thin air and those that required the handling of a physical object.</p><p>At least for now, Xu Xiaoshou could not carve a spiritual array out of thin air on an entity.</p><p>Even if he tried hundreds of times and wanted to break through this shackle, he still faintly felt that something was missing.</p><p>‘Is this the threshold?’</p><p>Perhaps this was the breaking point between Innate Stage and Master Stage.</p><p>For others, maybe this setback would last a lifetime.</p><p>For Xu Xiaoshou, the obstacle preventing him from obtaining that skill was a matter of 25,000 Passive Points.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was currently penniless.</p><p>“Damn…”</p><p>With a feeble moan, Xu Xiaoshou stopped struggling.</p><p>If this went on, it would be in vain and a waste of time.</p><p>The most urgent matter on hand was to earn more Passive Points.</p><p>He pushed open the door and stepped out of the courtyard. Unknowingly, night had fallen.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou inhaled a breath of fresh air and made little effort to tidy himself up. He held his hands to his mouth, shouting at the top of his lungs.</p><p>“Enemy attack!”</p><p>His distressed scream sounded for less than a second before two figures raced toward him from the sky.</p><p>Mu Zixi landed on the roof tiles, her double ponytails curling with her movement. She released a violent wood attribute breath.</p><p>Xin Gugu behaved more like a startled bird. He had already imagined that Zhang Mansion would not let the two of them off so easily.</p><p>It was possible that they tailed them secretly and were undiscovered.</p><p>This scream of an enemy attack instantly verified the idea in his mind.</p><p>“It’s good that you have come!”</p><p>A golden light was the first cast, followed by a cloud of blood mist that flew past, binding the Golden Staff in the void.</p><p>As soon as the bounded domain opened, it wrapped around the entire manor.</p><p>“Since you dared to come over, there is no escape now!”</p><p>The two had rushed over frantically. When they looked at Xu Xiaoshou in the courtyard, he seemed to be stretching.</p><p>Mu Zixi was speechless.</p><p>Cursed, Passive Point +1.</p><p>Xin Gugu was confused.</p><p>Suspected, Passive Point +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou bowed his body slightly.</p><p>“Are you coming?”</p><p>He took out the invitation in his hand and waved it. “Come, I’ll take you to a good place where we can eat and drink!”</p><p>Xin Gugu felt deflated after his impressive entrance. “Xu Xiaoshou, where is the enemy?”</p><p>“He escaped.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou acted nonchalantly.</p><p>He could not be bothered to call for them one by one, nor did he want to elaborate further. He just said softly, “I only have to raise a finger, and Zhang Taiying would run with his tail between his legs!”</p><p>Xin Gugu was shocked.</p><p>‘As if I would believe that!’</p><p>Suspected, Passive Points, +1.</p><p>“So, is there no enemy?”</p><p>“Hehe.” Xu Xiaoshou patted him on the shoulder without saying much. He looked back at his junior sister.</p><p>“There is a banquet dinner. Do you want to go? I got the invitation from the handsome guy who wanted to charm you that day.”</p><p>“If you go, maybe you can change from a country chicken into…”</p><p>“Ah!” Mu Zixi immediately kicked him forcefully and looked at him with daggers in her eyes.</p><p>“What country chicken?”</p><p>“You are the country chicken!”</p><p>Cursed, Passive Points +1, +1, +1, +1…</p><p>“Hehe, I am the country chicken… I am the country chicken…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cowered slightly and said, “Alright. You are a phoenix, okay?”</p><p>The little girl raised her head haughtily with a smug look in her eyes. “I don’t need you to tell me that. I really am a phoenix!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at her serious expression and reached out his hand to pinch her face.</p><p>“Tsk tsk… Really… I only gave you some color, and now you can open a dyehouse! You don’t need any encouragement at all, do you?”</p><p>“Would you like me to light up a candle for you so you can put on a shadow puppet show? Perhaps this peacock will then spread its plumage.”</p><p>Mu Zixi was dumbfounded.</p><p>She did not know what the hell Xu Xiaoshou was talking about.</p><p>Intuitively, she sensed that this guy had to be mocking her.</p><p>‘How hateful!’</p><p>“What do you mean?” Mu Zixi’s eyes blazed contemptuously.</p><p>“Nothing!” Xu Xiaoshou spread his hands. “If the country chicken doesn’t cover itself and lights a candle to see its shadow, who would think it is a phoenix?”</p><p>“Did you really think that you could grow bigger by looking in the mirror?”</p><p>Big?</p><p>Mu Zixi heard this word without catching anything else.</p><p>As soon as she lowered her head, she saw her little feet. Suddenly, the vein on her forehead throbbed menacingly.</p><p>“Xu, Xiao, Shou!”</p><p>She rushed toward him.</p><p>In the courtyard, a flurry of green plants instantly flew up to the sky. Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly flew up to the void, evading one after another.</p><p>“Don’t mess around!”</p><p>“If we want to do gardening, there is no need to be so violent…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was saying no on his mouth, but he had a cheeky look on his face.</p><p>As he flew, he pointed out various spots. His mouth ran on without stopping.</p><p>“Right, plant some big trees on the rocks here!”</p><p>“You can also plant some by the pool. I will fly around, and you will encircle him…”</p><p>“Xin Gugu?”</p><p>“Get out of the way! We can form a spirit-gathering array here, so don’t obstruct us!”</p><p>“Junior Sister, plant the trees first. Later, I will cast the spell personally!”</p><p>Mu Zixi looked at Xu Xiaoshou, who was jumping up and down. She realized that she could not keep up with his speed.</p><p>Every tree she generated sprouted behind his behind, but it could not reach him. No, they could not even rub against him.</p><p>Did he get stronger again?</p><p>Cursed, Passive Points +1, +1, +1, +1…</p><p>Xin Gugu watched the two of them fooling around in the courtyard. In a flash, his surroundings were shrouded in green.</p><p>He felt somewhat redundant standing there.</p><p>“Never mind.”</p><p>When he turned around, he released the bounded domain.</p><p>“I was so worried about your life that I could not sleep at night. But here you are playing around in front of me.”</p><p>Xin Gugu felt like his efforts were for nothing. He sighed heavily and turned away bitterly.</p><p>“Don’t go!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the person who was about to leave and suddenly became anxious. “You haven’t watched me cast a spell yet!”</p><p>He pointed his finger in the direction of Mu Zixi.</p><p>“Set!”</p><p>Dozens of spirit needles flew out in an instant like a meteor passing through the sky at night. They directly wrapped around Mu Zixi under her surprised gaze.</p><p>“Restraining Array?”</p><p>He had trapped Mu Zixi with these spirit needles. Her expression changed as she felt the strange imprisonment power.</p><p>‘Spiritual array?’</p><p>‘When did Xu Xiaoshou learn about spiritual arrays?’</p><p>She raised her little head. Her eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>Suspected, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Xin Gugu paused in his step. He also noticed Xu Xiaoshou’s new abilities.</p><p>“These are… Are they spirit needles? What are they?”</p><p>Seeing that Mu Zixi could not move after Xu Xiaoshou’s command, Xin Gugu was shocked.</p><p>However, no one could understand the power of this Weaving Technique without being trapped in the spirit thread.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou ignored him and smiled lightly to himself in the air.</p><p>“Watch closely! I am going to cast a spell!”</p><p>Under the starry sky, Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyes. Behind him, tens of thousands of Swords of the Space appeared out of thin air.</p><p>These swords were naturally useless for drawing arrays, but…</p><p>What a spectacular sight.</p><p>Under the shocked gaze of the two, Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand again.</p><p>Instantly, hundreds of spirit needles soared through the light, leaping toward the courtyard like excited elves. They formed a crystal-clear outline of a Vitality Diagram under the starry night.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou closed his hand and secretly swallowed a magic pill. He twitched his mouth and stood with his hands behind him.</p><p>The full moon behind him reflected his silhouette mysteriously. The 10,000 swords also made him appear majestic and impressive.</p><p>“I said that there must be wind!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou flung the sleeves of his robe. The Courtyard Map suddenly illuminated amid the extraordinary sight.</p><p>If the gods summoned and Buddha called, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth would gather madly under these words. The sudden strong gust that enveloped Xu Xiaoshou sent his clothes flapping with a loud rustle.</p><p>At this moment, not only Mu Zixi looked a little dumbstruck, but even Xin Gugu was also rendered speechless.</p><p>Revered, Passive Points +2.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
