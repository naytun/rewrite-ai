If there were an accident outside, it would be a big deal.</p><p>That was because the City Guarding Array would be turned on tonight.</p><p>The blue light curtain rose from and enveloped the entire city. When the void was closed, all those who raised their eyes and looked at the sky were impressed.</p><p>“The City Guarding Array was launched. The City Lord Mansion banquet dinner…”</p><p>“Is it about to start?”</p><p>…</p><p>“We have arrived!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned when he walked to his destination following the map on the invitation. He used his spiritual senses to view it.</p><p>Behind him, Mu Zixi also adopted a similar dazed expression. She stared straight ahead with her huge eyes and unconsciously swallowed her saliva.</p><p>“Is this… Is this the City Lord Mansion?”</p><p>The sight before her was a magnificent palace that glittered blindingly.</p><p>The brilliant golden external wall went on for miles. Even if Xu Xiaoshou stood a few feet away, he could not see the ends of either side.</p><p>“How big is this place?”</p><p>Not to mention the wall, just the gate at the doorway was several feet high.</p><p>There were two rows of door sentinels standing beside the gate. He counted 36 people in total.</p><p>The door sentinels were clad in silver armor. They had solemn expressions on their faces and were armed with spears and swords. It was a sight to behold.</p><p>“Why is it called the City Lord Mansion? It might as well change its name to The Forbidden City instead!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stopped in his steps. He gazed at the imperial palace in front of him and only felt that the Small Manor he recently bought dulled in comparison.</p><p>It was crushed by such competition.</p><p>“No wonder…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou murmured to himself. No wonder Fu Xing had such a weird expression when he asked Fu Xing how big his house was and whether it could accommodate hundreds of people.</p><p>A few hundred people would only occupy the area of a toilet for a house of this size.</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou calmly spoke, pulling Mu Zixi to move forward.</p><p>‘I cannot reveal to others that I am country bumpkin!’</p><p>‘I have seen the world!’</p><p>‘Perhaps not before, but now I have!’</p><p>He suddenly dragged Mu Zixi from her shock. She looked startled. She lowered her head to try to pull her hands out of his grip.</p><p>After a while, she blushed suddenly and stopped her actions.</p><p>‘He, he held my hand?’</p><p>Her heart thumped…</p><p>And thumped…</p><p>At that moment…</p><p>Watched, Passive Points +1.</p><p>The sudden popup notification cast Xu Xiaoshou in shock, and he stopped in his thoughts.</p><p>He paused, and his hand moved in a forceful reflex.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Mu Zixi immediately let out a strange cry. Her face turned green.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou! What are you doing?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly released the hand of his junior sister and forced himself to calm down.</p><p>Was someone staring at him again?</p><p>Who was it?</p><p>He thought of the arrest warrant issued by Zhang Taiying…</p><p>‘No way. Can that guy be staring at me at this time?’</p><p>‘Should he not take care of himself instead?’</p><p>‘Xin Gugu should be sauntering in front of his house at this time!’</p><p>Without thinking further, Xu Xiaoshou turned his head and pulled his junior sister’s hand with a sigh of relief.</p><p>His gaze wandered, carefully searching the surroundings with Perception. However, he discovered nothing except a few wealthy people who wanted to enter the City Lord Mansion.</p><p>‘Who could it be?’</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!” Mu Zixi glared at her senior brother, who was blowing wildly on her now-bloodied hands.</p><p>“Cough, don’t be afraid. I’m here!” Xu Xiaoshou looked a little flustered.</p><p>Mu Zixi was furious. Did he ask her not to be afraid?</p><p>What she feared most now was his sudden tenderness.</p><p>Cursed, Passive Points +1.</p><p>“Go, keep going!”</p><p>After a while, they had already gone around 13 times. Xu Xiaoshou realized that if he stayed in place, someone might see him. He immediately let out a vitality breath, pulling the little girl with him and leaving.</p><p>“Uh~”</p><p>There was a groan.</p><p>Cursed, Passive Points +1, +1, +1, +1…</p><p>…</p><p>“Stop right there!”</p><p>The silver-armored door sentinel shot his spear and stopped Xu Xiaoshou in his tracks. His hands stretched out as he barked, “Invitation card!”</p><p>“Here.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou handed over the gold gilded invitation card that he had prepared. At this crucial moment, there should be no trouble.</p><p>The door sentinel examined it before closing it.</p><p>“You may enter.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pointed at the girl behind him. “We are together. Can she enter?”</p><p>“Yes.” The door sentinel nodded. “Your invitation entitles you to bring three guests.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded and took a step toward the door.</p><p>Right before he stepped in, the notification popped out again.</p><p>Watched, Passive Point +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his heart hammering in his chest, and he halted in his step again.</p><p>Behind him, Mu Zixi could not stop in time and hit her head against him.</p><p>“Ouch.”</p><p>Fortunately, her previous experiences had finally taught her a lesson to always keep her spiritual source protection on. So, she was not affected and sent flying back from the force.</p><p>The little girl covered her forehead and shot him a resentful look.</p><p>‘He stopped again!’</p><p>Cursed, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around. His sixth sense compelled him to look behind. He was not disappointed and saw a figure rushing out of the woods.</p><p>It was a scruffy-looking lad with stains and smears on his face. He looked to be about 15 or 16 years old.</p><p>He had a long braid. The hair on his scalp was as oily as rapeseed. It was unbearable to look at him.</p><p>As soon as he saw Xu Xiaoshou, the boy yelled and rushed over.</p><p>“Big Brother!”</p><p>“I finally waited for you! Why have you only come now? They pushed me earlier!”</p><p>The young man’s voice had a nasal tone as if he was about to cry. His eyes were whirling with tears.</p><p>Coupled with the muddy body above, he was like a weak teenager bullied by the door sentinel.</p><p>The door sentinel knew him too. When he watched the lad jump, a spear blocked his chest.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>“I have already told you, no invitation, no entry!”</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou heard that, he quickly understood what had happened.</p><p>That lad wanted to enter the City Lord Mansion, but he did not have an invitation. He could only wait for a kindhearted person to bring him in.</p><p>It seemed that the Watched just now came from that guy.</p><p>However, he had been scanning for so long. Why had he not spotted that person?</p><p>Was it all so simple?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his heart stop. He wanted to turn around cautiously, but when he looked at the aggrieved eyes of the young man, he suddenly stopped.</p><p>‘Do I look like a fool?’</p><p>‘I must look like a nice person. Does he think that I will I bring him in for no reason?’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated for a while as if recalling his memories before he spoke.</p><p>“Little Brother?”</p><p>When the young man heard his words, his tear-filled eyes glittered with hope. “Big Brother, it is me. Do you still remember me?”</p><p>“I can’t recall who you are.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The boy choked before he could say anything.</p><p>Cursed, Passive Point +1.</p><p>He burst into tears, squeezing his fists. He shook his head and struggled with his words. “This is impossible. How can you forget me? We were…”</p><p>“What were we…”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The boy saw that Xu Xiaoshou did not catch on and widened his eyes incredulously. “Have you really forgotten me? Can’t you even remember my name?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lowered his head and hesitated for a while. Suddenly, his face lit up in recognition. “Oh, is it you?”</p><p>The boy’s eyes glittered in excitement.</p><p>“Big Brother, you have recalled! My name is…”</p><p>“Your name is…” Xu Xiaoshou tilted his head with eyes squinting as if he were trying to recall.</p><p>“Well, my name is…” There was encouragement in the boy’s eyes. He seemed to expect his big brother to recognize him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought for some time. Suddenly, his eyes widened, and he pointed at the other party.</p><p>“I remember! It’s you… Xu Xiaoji, right?”</p><p>“???”</p><p>Suspected, Passive Points +1.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
