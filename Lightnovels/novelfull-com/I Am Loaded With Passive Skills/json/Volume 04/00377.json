He had no idea who let out that sound.</p><p>The young man opposite him turned green in his face. He had not expected that after the long silence, Xu Xiaoshou would coin such a name.</p><p>But…</p><p>“Big Brother, you recognized me! I knew you wouldn’t forget me!” The boy sobbed and attempted to push away the spear, but he flew out immediately with a thump.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was aghast.</p><p>How could he accept a name like Xu Xiaoji?</p><p>To enter the City Lord Mansion, it seemed that he would tolerate anything.</p><p>What was he after?</p><p>“Is it you?” Xu Xiaoshou exhibited a surprised look on his face.</p><p>The young lad, Xu Xiaoji, fell to the ground and struggled to crawl halfway. He lost his footing when he heard those words and fell directly to the ground.</p><p>Cursed, Passive Points +1.</p><p>He touched the mud on his mouth. The tears in his eyes made their way out.</p><p>“It’s me, Jiji! Big Brother, you finally remembered!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt goosebumps rising.</p><p>He was amazed by this lad.</p><p>He carefully examined the young lad’s condition and discovered that he indeed had no spiritual source at all.</p><p>Was he an ordinary person?</p><p>That was impossible.</p><p>There had to be something off with him.</p><p>Was he also a killer? A killer from Three Incenses?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little uncertain, but if the killer of Sovereign Stage made an appearance in this way…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that it was unnecessary.</p><p>He was merely an Innate Stage, so was it even worth the effort?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>Mu Zixi pulled his sleeves and shook her head slightly.</p><p>Even she could tell that something was wrong with this guy.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned and thought for a while, but he looked at the door sentinel and said, “He’s my little brother. Please let him in.”</p><p>He was not afraid of the enemies who made themselves known to him, but he was anxious that this guy would disappear and secretly stalk him.</p><p>It was the safest if his enemy was within his grasp.</p><p>The door sentinel had a question mark on his face.</p><p>Suspected, Passive Points +38.</p><p>In this episode, even a blind man could see that the two had no relation at all, yet Xu Xiaoshou had acknowledged this little brother.</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoji himself was in absolute disbelief.</p><p>He had hit so many roadblocks and found no one willing to entertain him. Now, he finally succeeded.</p><p>It perplexed him that the key to his success was so inexplicable.</p><p>‘Is my acting so good? Was he fooled?’ Xu Xiaoji did not know what to make of the situation.</p><p>The door sentinel breathed lightly and asked, “Are you sure?”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded his head in affirmation. “How can I not recognize my little brother?”</p><p>“But he has many big brothers!” The door sentinel attempted to persuade him.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“From now on, he has only one big brother!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled and reached out his hand to the lad on the ground.</p><p>Under the reflection of the full moon, the young lad Xu Xiaoji seemed to have seen the divine light radiating from behind his Big Brother Xu Xiaoshou at that instant.</p><p>“Big Brother!”</p><p>He cried loudly and rushed forward to hug Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Damn it, wait!”</p><p>It was too late!</p><p>The moment Xu Xiaoji leeched onto Xu Xiaoshou, blood suddenly burst out of his body with a bang, and he fell to the street.</p><p>“???”</p><p>Suspected, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Mu Zixi watched the scene from behind with a trembling heart. Her face was ashen.</p><p>She was familiar with this situation.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou heaved a sigh.</p><p>“My stupid little brother, you only need to call Big Brother. Why do you need to hug me?”</p><p>He stepped forward to pass him a magic pill. Unconsciously, his Perception detected that the boy whose ribcage had cracked from the impact was instantly recovering.</p><p>“That…”</p><p>That speed of recovery was almost on par with his Eternal Vitality.</p><p>What was the origin of that guy?</p><p>He hesitated for a moment but stepped forward and handed the magic pill over.</p><p>“Big Brother!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoji looked at him with misty eyes. He was speechless as he swallowed the magic pill tearfully and suddenly became animated once more.</p><p>“Are you a killer?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou leaned over and cut to the chase.</p><p>The boy looked dumbfounded after hearing this question.</p><p>Was he so direct?</p><p>“Big Brother, I am not… You, you misunderstood…”</p><p>“Are you lying to me?”</p><p>“No, I am not!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the Information Bar. He observed that nothing had changed, and he immediately frowned.</p><p>He remembered that he had triggered a type of alert before called Deceived.</p><p>The trigger for that type of alert was most unusual, and he had no way of reproducing that incident or unearthing a pattern.</p><p>Sometimes it would be triggered by other people when they were lying, and sometimes it would not.</p><p>Were there any restrictions to it?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated for a while and then continued to ask, “Are you a killer?”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Deceived, Passive Point +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>At this moment, his hair stood up.</p><p>He cursed inwardly and wondered what was going on.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the young man, who was less than a few inches away and never felt so close to death.</p><p>He adopted a passive expression and tried very hard to conceal the shock in his heart.</p><p>This kid was still pretending.</p><p>He could not expose himself.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried to still his throbbing heart. He attempted his best to remember what the difference between these two questions was.</p><p>‘There seems to be no difference. How can different answers trigger the same alert?’</p><p>Hmm?</p><p>Different answers?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou closely scrutinized the young man below him and grabbed his hand, pulling him to his feet. He pointed at the big tree beside him.</p><p>“Is this a tree?”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>The lad was stunned.</p><p>Was he seriously asking this question?</p><p>They were talking about a different topic just now, so how did he switch to this channel suddenly?</p><p>Suspected, Passive Point +1.</p><p>“Answer me,” Xu Xiaoshou demanded.</p><p>The boy hesitated. “Yes.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the Information Bar, but there was no movement.</p><p>“You can only answer yes and no.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The young man did not hesitate. This was his golden ticket into the City Lord Mansion. He only had to keep up with the pace of the person before him.</p><p>Even at this pace, he almost broke his waist bending over.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the Information Bar, but there was no sign of movement on it.</p><p>Oh, he was right after all…</p><p>That was indeed a tree!</p><p>“Say ‘No.’”</p><p>Xu Xiaoji was speechless.</p><p>‘Big Brother, my dearest Big Brother, what do you want to do?’</p><p>Xu Xiaoji almost keeled over.</p><p>He seriously considered if he should end this and immediately terminate their newly claimed relations. Perhaps he should worship another big brother.</p><p>“Hurry up,” Xu Xiaoshou urged him.</p><p>The young Xu Xiaoji glanced at the sky feebly.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Deceived, Passive Point +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was thrilled, and his eyes shone brightly.</p><p>Indeed…</p><p>It could only detect a lie when the words “Yes” and “No” were mentioned.</p><p>To be precise, did this pair of antonyms “Yes” and “No” need to be present to fulfill the condition that triggered the Deceived alert?</p><p>Whether or not it was necessary, Xu Xiaoshou did not know. With that lever, he was confident that he could take advantage of the system.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suppressed his delight at his discovery and turned his head to look at the glorious palace behind the door sentinels. He was eager to verify his theory and quizzed the lad once more. “Is this the City Lord Mansion?”</p><p>“Mmm.”</p><p>“?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>“Now say ‘No.’”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Deceived, Passive Point +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled contentedly. He was getting close to unraveling the mystery behind the elusive Deceived alert.</p><p>He pointed to the sky again.</p><p>“Is that the moon?”</p><p>“No!” Xu Xiaoji felt insulted.</p><p>Deceived, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grinned as the corners of his lips curved. He was chuckling deep in his heart and elated beyond words. He looked around and realized that there was nothing else to point out.</p><p>He looked at the boy thoughtfully.</p><p>“You are a human!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoji looked humiliated and almost burst into tears.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The air was quiet for a second.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little taken aback.</p><p>What happened to the alert?</p><p>Where did Deceived go? Did this broken system fail him again?</p><p>Suddenly, his pupils contracted.</p><p>That was not right.</p><p>“Not a human” did not trigger Deceived. Did this mean that he was telling the truth?</p><p>“You, you… Say ‘Yes.’”</p><p>The lad rolled his eyes in frustration. “What the hell are you trying to do? I can’t stand you anymore!”</p><p>“Say ‘Yes!’”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hollered.</p><p>“Yes!” Xu Xiaoji responded reluctantly.</p><p>Deceived, Passive Point +1.</p><p>It was at this moment that Xu Xiaoshou felt as though he had ascended to heaven. He was on cloud nine.</p><p>He immediately fell to the ground, trying to search for the shadow of the young man on the floor. It was just his luck that dark clouds were covering the moon.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hugged the lad tightly.</p><p>“I was wrong!”</p><p>“Big Brother, you are my Big Brother!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoji was in disbelief.</p><p>He was stunned for a while, and his face burned red with anger.</p><p>“Ahhhhhhh!”</p><p>What kind of psycho had he encountered?</p><p>Was this lunatic even human?</p><p>Cursed, Passive Point +1.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
