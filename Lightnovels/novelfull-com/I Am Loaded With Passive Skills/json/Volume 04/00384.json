It was not a humanly possible feat at all.</p><p>The spiritual array essentially broke the rules of the world. Following specific spiritual patterns, they were to grant a space a new set of rules so one could achieve the purpose they wished want to in that spiritual array.</p><p>During regular times, seeing two- or three-layered Nested Spiritual Arrays was already extremely terrifying.</p><p>Now, the ones here were seven or eight layers.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt sheepish.</p><p>Could he stand it?</p><p>Unable to hold back his inner curiosity, he flew upward to investigate it.</p><p>He soon surpassed the coverage area of the sea of flowers.</p><p>Under the bird’s eye view, his spiritual senses immediately saw through everything.</p><p>Perception could discover all nearby things, and it was very detailed. At this time, the advantages of spiritual senses were evident.</p><p>It was like an endless ocean. Even if Xu Xiaoshou’s Perception was at its limit, it still failed to discover the edge of the sea of flowers.</p><p>On the other hand, spiritual senses could discover that far away from this sea of flowers, there seemed to be a trace of life.</p><p>The life force was incredibly weak. It was also entirely concealed by the spiritual array. If someone else were to search for it, they would definitely miss it out.</p><p>However, who was Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>He was very familiar with the vitality breath, and he had just finished comprehending the Vitality Diagram of the human body. With a look, he managed to seek out the vitality breath through this Nested Spiritual Array.</p><p>‘Is there someone?’</p><p>He was surprised. What kind of presence could be in the sea of flowers?</p><p>Was this terrifying Nested Spiritual Array the work of this person?</p><p>Spiritual senses were not Perception. Xu Xiaoshou could only make out a vague trace, and he could not figure out where the other party was located.</p><p>At this time, Xu Xiaoshou had already given up hope.</p><p>Perhaps he had already unconsciously entered the forbidden grounds of the City Lord Mansion by mistake.</p><p>It had made plenty of sense. Along the way, he had avoided almost everyone and all the spiritual arrays, so, naturally, no one stopped him and prevented him from going further in this direction.</p><p>‘We must leave!’</p><p>The more Xu Xiaoshou thought about it, the more something felt off. He looked down at Mu Zixi, who was still struggling.</p><p>Just as he wanted to communicate with her telepathically, a popup notification appeared on the Information Bar.</p><p>Watched, Passive Points +1.</p><p>‘Damn it!’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his heart beating wildly.</p><p>Was he discovered?</p><p>He immediately wanted to escape from the air and crouch down, but at this moment, a strong gust of wind swept across the sea of flowers and sent them rustling.</p><p>The array pattern concealed in the void appeared suddenly, its many layers interlocking tightly. Like a spark, it instantly lit up the entire sea of flowers.</p><p>“Are there so many spiritual arrays?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was horror-struck. He realized that the spiritual array in the sea of flowers had attracted him.</p><p>And here, there were more than that.</p><p>Even in the void, there were numerous array patterns carved out.</p><p>Where the sky and earth met, that Nested Spiritual Array was not a two-dimensional plane but a three-dimensional one.</p><p>A strong seal smell emanated from it, trying to suppress Xu Xiaoshou. Even if the multiple spiritual arrays were rampant, Xu Xiaoshou’s Toughness was still the undefeated champion.</p><p>‘Can’t I hold it down?’</p><p>It seemed that in this world, there was nothing that could make him bow his head down.</p><p>The knowledge filled Xu Xiaoshou with delight. Of all the spiritual arrays in the surroundings, the highest level was at the peak of the Master Stage. There was no Sovereign Stage spiritual array.</p><p>‘Why is that so?’</p><p>‘Being able to possess this Nested Spiritual Array ability, the Sovereign Stage level spiritual array would be a piece of cake.’</p><p>‘Why isn’t there any Sovereign Stage spiritual array in this sea of flowers?’</p><p>The doubts spread in his heart, but Xu Xiaoshou did not struggle to answer them then. Instead, he let his body’s Suppression Power take over. He fell into the sea of flowers on the ground.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Mu Zixi hurried over quickly with a worried expression on her face.</p><p>The sudden change in the sea of flowers had unnerved her terribly.</p><p>As soon as the array pattern lit up, the girl felt like she had stepped onto an altar. It was as if she would be the sacrificial lamb facing its final moments in the very next second.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>“This place is too malevolent to stay!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated no further. After he finished speaking, he immediately pulled Mu Zixi and left.</p><p>Even though the spiritual array was formidable, it could not stop him with his Array Shattering Divine Instruments Perception.</p><p>At this moment, another message popped out on the Information Bar.</p><p>Suspected, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his body immediately. Could that fellow see him?</p><p>Suspected?</p><p>What was he suspecting?</p><p>Could the hidden party have seen through his act? Was his Array Shattering of no use against him?</p><p>He panicked even more and realized that the invisible force behind the sea of flowers was definitely not an ordinary person.</p><p>That wave was too strong.</p><p>If things did not pan out following his plans, perhaps this would not be the place where he would be burying Zhang Taiying’s bones, but it would be his burial ground instead.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Mu Zixi had already sensed Xu Xiaoshou’s panic, but she also knew that she could not simply walk around. She followed Xu Xiaoshou’s pace closely.</p><p>It was all over. Xu Xiaoshou’s plans of using the grove and the sea of flowers to lure Zhang Taiying had been discovered.</p><p>She was still thinking about it amusedly and did not see Xu Xiaoshou in front of her, who suddenly jolted. He forcibly retracted the step he was about to take and stopped at the void.</p><p>Under his feet, a ring of light suddenly appeared.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou could not hold his step back, he would have stepped in with one foot.</p><p>No one knew what the consequences were.</p><p>Even though he pulled himself subconsciously, Mu Zixi could not control herself.</p><p>The two of them were too close. The distance between Xu Xiaoshou and Mu Zixi was from foot to foot as she feared losing sight of him.</p><p>As soon as Xu Xiaoshou stopped, the little girl ran into it.</p><p>Fortunately, Mu Zixi, who had learned from the past, had her spiritual source protection permanently turned on and was not directly blasted away.</p><p>The tremor still made her take a step back.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around abruptly and was about to hold Mu Zixi with a hand.</p><p>It was too late.</p><p>As soon as the little girl’s feet stepped back, a ring of light appeared at the appropriate time. When she stepped on it, she disappeared with a cry of “Ah!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>Had she teleported away?</p><p>He was disconcerted.</p><p>What level of the spiritual array was this?</p><p>Could a Master Stage Spiritual Array achieve teleportation effects?</p><p>That was simply unscientific.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his heart suspending with his breath. He could no longer think about where it had sent Mu Zixi.</p><p>He did not have the urge to follow his junior sister’s footsteps to find out where she had been teleported…</p><p>Not to mention whether the two teleported destinations would be the same place.</p><p>The consequences alone were too severe to think about.</p><p>It would be better to sacrifice one than two.</p><p>No, that was not the case.</p><p>It was better if one of them could escape.</p><p>If no one could go out, how could he find Fu Xing to help with the search for Mu Zixi?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked back at the Information Bar. He had already established that the person in the sea of flowers was manipulating all this. That person must have discovered his peculiarity too.</p><p>Outwitted, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Suspected, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Regarding those two pieces of information, the first was the key to Xu Xiaoshou stopping himself in time. The second was the timely feedback from the other party after he had stopped.</p><p>It was a pity that he could not convey the reasons behind this to Mu Zixi in time.</p><p>Otherwise, this little girl would probably not die so miserably.</p><p>‘Is he playing with me?’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had a strange expression on his face. He turned his head and looked directly at the unknown person.</p><p>He could not see this person, but the other person could see him.</p><p>Watched, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath. He looked back across the distance from the edge of the sea of flowers.</p><p>Even though it was only a few feet away, there was some ghost teleportation. One thing was certain… He could not get out of the sea of flowers tonight.</p><p>In that case…</p><p>He stopped and turned around slowly. Suddenly, hundreds of spirit needles lit up behind him.</p><p>At this moment, the colorful sea of flowers rustled.</p><p>The wind whispered, and thousands of flowers bowed down. There was a feeling that the mountains and rain were about to come.</p><p>Even if he could not see the person opposite him, Xu Xiaoshou still felt mockery from the other party. He seemed to be laughing at him for not knowing his abilities.</p><p>Ridiculed, Passive Points +1.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
