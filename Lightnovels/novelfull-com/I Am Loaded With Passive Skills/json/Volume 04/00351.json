Da.</p><p>Crisp sounds of steps could be heard from the sapphire slate.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou basked in the moonlight as he walked into Zhang Mansion with his hands behind his back, feeling comfortable.</p><p>“What do you think? I said earlier that I have a way to enter, right?”</p><p>Xin Gugu was completely dazed and speechless.</p><p>He did not think that Xu Xiaoshou’s late-night attack on the Zhang family would actually be directly walking with a swagger into the mansion.</p><p>‘Isn’t this f**king exposing yourself to the enemy?’</p><p>‘Even if you changed your appearance… Even if you had Yuan Mansion as your backup, but…’</p><p>‘But…’</p><p>‘How could this have worked?’</p><p>Xin Gugu was in a daze.</p><p>Even though he was someone with big dreams, every time he followed Xu Xiaoshou’s steps, he was still stunned and in awe.</p><p>He was merely an Innate Stage cultivator. What was his mind made up of to have thought of such a wild and bold plan?</p><p>Just thinking about it was fine, but this fella dared to execute it.</p><p>Executing it was fine, but he actually succeeded. They really entered Zhang Mansion.</p><p>‘This is f*cking…’</p><p>Xin Gugu remembered that the Zhang family had more than one Sovereign and thought about how the longer the battle was delayed, the more time other Sovereigns would have to arrive and help out.</p><p>He panicked.</p><p>“How about you? What do you think of this?” He patted Aje’s arm.</p><p>Aje’s head lowered. It stared at Xin Gugu’s hand with red-lit eyes under its hat. After a moment, it replied.</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>Xin Gugu was speechless.</p><p>‘F*ck, these two crazy guys!’</p><p>Criticized, Passive Points +1.</p><p>The head of the guards looked at the weird three-person combination behind him and thought that they were Young Master Zhang’s friends from the Spiritual Palace.</p><p>“This way please,” he politely said.</p><p>Even though they might look young, people from Tiansang Spiritual Palace had strong abilities and great potential.</p><p>If not for meeting Xu Xiaoshou at that time, Young Master Zhang would have already been doing very well.</p><p>The small group reached a corner, but Xu Xiaoshou looked at the other end and stopped in his tracks.</p><p>He pointed to the other side and asked, “Where does that direction lead to?”</p><p>The guard smiled and said, “That would be the Master’s private residence. We are not allowed to go there.”</p><p>“At this time, they are all in the main hall having a meeting. We should walk this way.”</p><p>He gestured his hand toward the main hall and stopped speaking.</p><p>Evidently, he would not say anymore regarding the Zhang family’s privacy.</p><p>“The Master’s private residence?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou mumbled but did not take another step. He asked, “I assume that would be where the head of the Zhang family sleeps, right?”</p><p>“If that is the case, where does Little Bear sleep?”</p><p>The guard was stunned for a moment.</p><p>‘Little Bear?’</p><p>‘This…’</p><p>‘Could it be…’</p><p>‘Referring to Young Master Zhang?’</p><p>A strong sense of violation arose from the bottom of his heart. This intimate way of referring to him made him realize that this man standing before him might have an extraordinarily close relationship with Young Master Zhang.</p><p>“It is also that direction.” The guard’s tone was even more polite now as he continued to explain, “All of the Zhang family’s elders have private residences in the eastern wing.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed.</p><p>It was too big.</p><p>Zhang Mansion was many times bigger than the one that he had.</p><p>Even if he had already entered this mansion and walked for almost half a day, he still had not seen the main hall. Now, he was hearing about the various wings of the mansion.</p><p>As expected, poverty limited one’s imagination.</p><p>“If that is the case, that eastern wing should be Zhang Mansion’s most precious place, right?” Xu Xiaoshou sighed lightly.</p><p>The guard frowned.</p><p>Even if he was Young Master Zhang’s friend, he did not seem to know the rules.</p><p>No one would ask so many questions as a guest. He thought, ‘If you want to ask, you should as Young Master Zhang. What good would it do you to ask me, a small guard, so many questions?’</p><p>“Naturally.”</p><p>He gave a perfunctory reply and continued. “This way, please. The Master is still waiting for you.”</p><p>“It’s fine. I don’t really want to meet your Master.” Xu Xiaoshou suddenly smiled.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>The guard was stunned.</p><p>What kind of a person was this? Did he think that he could go anywhere he liked once he stepped into Zhang Mansion?</p><p>Suspected, Passive Points +1.</p><p>“Gentlemen, please do not waste any more time,” the guard said in a low tone. “Master is still waiting. If this causes things to delay, it will make life difficult for me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled while squinting his eyes. He slowly raised his arm.</p><p>Since he had already found the best place for the epicenter of the explosion, why would he still need to meet Zhang Taiying?</p><p>They would meet sooner or later. There was no rush now.</p><p>Moreover, if he were to meet him now, that would be throwing himself at the enemy.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>With a chop of his hand, the guard fell to the ground.</p><p>“Let’s go”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand and was about to start walking toward the eastern wing.</p><p>Xin Gugu pointed at the guard on the floor and said, “He is still breathing.”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“Do you want to kill him?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paused at his step and said, “There’s no need for that. He is just a guard, so there’s no need to kill him.”</p><p>Xin Gugu frowned.</p><p>‘Are you a good man now?’</p><p>‘You are already f*cking here to wreck this mansion, now you want to tell me about how pitiful this little guard is.’</p><p>When he saw his expression, Xin Gugu instantly guessed that this young man was not adept at taking peoples’ lives.</p><p>He nodded. “Alright.”</p><p>With that said, the three of them headed toward the direction of the eastern wing.</p><p>Under his Perception, a red light exited the guard’s body. It went underground, flew onto Xin Gugu’s body, and disappeared…</p><p>Without any sound.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes narrowed as he sighed deeply.</p><p>Without any further comments, he continued to lead the way.</p><p>“Follow me.”</p><p>“There are arrays here, so be careful.”</p><p>…</p><p>His Perception’s true abilities were very strong.</p><p>Even if the eastern wing had complicated spiritual arrays, they could not stop Xu Xiaoshou’s pace.</p><p>Of course, his current Perception was not at the Master Stage yet, hence, it naturally was hard for him to decipher Master Stage spiritual arrays.</p><p>Other than the large array protecting the whole mansion, the spiritual arrays here were basically not of the Master Stage.</p><p>After all, this was not the Tiansang Spirit Palace or the City Lord Mansion.</p><p>With a few Sovereigns present, the Zhang family’s defense would not really require such spiritual arrays.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou arrived in a magnificent courtyard.</p><p>Looking at the style and decorations, and comparing it to that of the surroundings, this was the most attention-grabbing courtyard. Thus, it could only be the private residences of Zhang Taiying.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the large spirit pond in front of him. It was filled with pool water that was formed with high-vitality spiritual water.</p><p>The spirit fishes that were raised in this pond were all colorful and highly spiritual, jumping easily into the air.</p><p>“Tsk tsk, what a waste.”</p><p>Thinking about how this area would all be gone later, Xu Xiaoshou let out a sigh.</p><p>Xin Gugu felt even more worried. He looked at Xu Xiaoshou and asked, “Hey, what are you thinking of doing?”</p><p>“Coming to people’s courtyard for no reason, are you thinking of hiding inside and having a honeymoon?” He tried to think like Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“What do you mean honeymoon? With whom? You and Zhang Taiying?” Xu Xiaoshou rolled his eyes.</p><p>He waved his hand and casually said, “Watch closely, I am going to… alchemize!”</p><p>“Alchemize?” Xin Gugu was shocked.</p><p>After coming so far and spending so much time, did he really want to alchemize there?</p><p>“Are you sick?” he growled softly.</p><p>“Aye, I’m not sick, but I have medicine.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed in response. He waved his hand and took out 18 boiling alchemy ingredients from his Yuan Mansion.</p><p>“The show is about to start!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
