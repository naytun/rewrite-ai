Great Demons such as Bull Demon King and Drake-Headed Immortal provided aid in the periphery. Then, the devil group rushed out.</p><p>The Buddhas and Mahamayuri of Western Pure Lands naturally wouldn’t allow them to leave.</p><p>The two sides became entangled in endless fighting.</p><p>Mahamayuri and Buddhism Bhante couldn’t overcome the Ivory Cloud Realm Flag hindering them, but it wasn’t easy for Nie Jingshen’s group to leave.</p><p>At this time, blooming green lotuses suddenly appeared in the void.</p><p>The leader was the wise and compassionate Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva.</p><p>The Buddhism Bhante group behind him was the first batch who left Western Pure Lands previously to establish a smokescreen in the eyes of other factions and provide cover for the second group of Buddhism Bhante, such as Vajrapramardi Buddha, who left later on.</p><p>Although the result wasn’t as fruitful as expected, Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva and the others came here in time after a detour and reinforced Buddhism’s forces here.</p><p>As soon as Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva appeared, he held the Mutton-fat Jade Bottle with a willow branch laid obliquely at the mouth of the bottle in his hand.</p><p>Bodhisattva took the willow branch and waved it lightly, incurring a blessing rain.</p><p>Wherever the rain reached, the people experiencing the blessings would have their vigor replenished. On the other hand, the rain showers were like boiling oil for the devil group, with smoke coming from their bodies alongside their painful groans.</p><p>When Nie Jingshen was drenched with the blessing rain, he let out a muffled snort.</p><p>The sword-light in his hand flickered, morphing into chaos in an instant, affecting the time and space of his perimeter.</p><p>Nie Jingshen robbed away the drizzling rains into one focal point through his sword light, abolishing the mystical effect Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva administered into the battlefield.</p><p>Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva held the willow branch in one hand and the Mutton-fat Jade Bottle in the other hand. Then, he directed the mouth of the bottle toward Nie Jingshen.</p><p>An immense suction came from the bottle’s mouth and assaulted Nie Jingshen.</p><p>Nie Jingshen sent out flickering sword lights as if there was a chaos outbreak with the primordial gulf reentering the world. This manifestation parried the bottle away.</p><p>Then, he maneuvered his sword agilely, sending out his slash to deflect Vajrapramardi Buddha’s Waspish Eyes against the devils.</p><p>Many masters on both sides fought endlessly and didn’t give in to each other.</p><p>But at this moment, the void suddenly split open. A golden-winged roc fluttered its wings and arrived in no time.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the attack arrived at golden light and Buddhism Bhante present.</p><p>Surprisingly, Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles intervened.</p><p>Mahamayuri’s Five-Colored Divine Radiance retaliated. Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles didn’t dare to receive the attack and quickly avoided it.</p><p>But the Devil Lord, who held the Sakyamuni Sarira, waved his hand and handed the sarira to Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles.</p><p>Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles picked up Sakyamuni Sarira and immediately flew away without looking back.</p><p>Mahamayuri was expressionless. The Five-Colored Divine Radiance changed its direction, showing no mercy to his brother.</p><p>Under the Five-Colored Divine Radiance, Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles suddenly felt his flight hindered.</p><p>Mahamayuri ignored the demons and devils to pursue the roc.</p><p>Although the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles’ speed was affected, he still tried to throw off the pursuer.</p><p>Two Great Demons of bird species left swiftly in the chase.</p><p>Without Mahamayuri’s deterrence on the side, the Nine Underworlds devil group and the Great Demon group faced a lot less pressure.</p><p>Western Pure Lands also lost the confidence to slay these enemies here.</p><p>But at this moment, a new change hit the cosmos.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge and others, who had been observing quietly, finally made a move.</p><p>Instead of participating in the battle between the brothers, Mahamayuri and Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles, the Daoism group focused on something else!</p><p>Their goal was the Green Lotus Treasured Flag polluted by the Nine Underworlds Abyss of Devilish Sea!</p><p>Looking at the thunderous Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor, Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva and Samantabhadra Bodhisattva all sighed, “Fellow Daoist Southern, you all are here as well in the end.”</p><p>“Is it alright for me to borrow some blessing rain?” Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor’s complexion was as usual when he spoke to Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva.</p><p>“We deserve to keep it for ourselves. Why do fellow Daoists eye on our possession?” Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva pointed at the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor as he spoke.</p><p>The main target wasn’t the blessing rain but the Green Lotus Treasured Flag.</p><p>Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva’s blessing rain was effective at cleaning the world’s pollution, including the seawater of the Nine Underworlds Devilish Sea.</p><p>It was just that the seawater that came from the Abyss of Devilish Sea was from the core of Nine Underworlds. So even if it could be cleaned, the cleansing effect wouldn’t be complete in a short time.</p><p>As the Green Lotus Treasured Flag was polluted by that seawater, the Buddhas could only wash it slowly after returning with the treasure.</p><p>But, Yan Zhaoge and others laid their eyes on this treasure.</p><p>Vajrapramardi Buddha, nearest the flag, ignored the black water on the surface and quickly retracted the flag.</p><p>But before he had time to make the next move, a slash manifested in the dark void suddenly!</p><p>The terrifying power of Encompassing Abyssal Absolute Annihilation capable of bringing ruination to all things came.</p><p>Fortunately, it was Vajrapramardi Buddha’s Golden Body with fantastic defense. He was caught off guard by Feng Yunsheng’s ambush. Even though he hadn’t perished in the ambush, he couldn’t effectively sustain the blow.</p><p>Vajrapramardi Buddha’s Land of Buddhism was shattered in this blow!</p><p>Luckily, Vajrapramardi Buddha’s defense still held firmly. Since he had been in an intense battle with a formidable enemy like Nie Jingshen, putting him in the battle-ready state, Feng Yunsheng’s attack didn’t kill him immediately.</p><p>The Land of Buddhism was shattered, but his Golden Body attained the vague state of being ethereal and material at the same time, attaining a more vital brilliance. With that, he barely sustained through Feng Yunsheng’s dangerous attack.</p><p>However, when Feng Yunsheng’s Soul Evoking Bell rang, Vajrapramardi Buddha’s movement slowed down.</p><p>The Golden Body of the Great Sage transformed by Pan Pan slammed Ru Yi Golden Cudgel over and knocked off the ineffective Green Lotus Treasured Flag away from Vajrapramardi Buddha’s grasp.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge caught the flag quickly and held it in his hand.</p><p>Buddhist Bhante such as Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva and Samantabhadra Bodhisattva wanted to interrupt, but Feng Yunsheng, Pan Pan, and the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor would never let them do so.</p><p>The Bull Demon King, Drake-Headed Immortal, the Great Demons group, and several Devil Lords surrounded the Daoism group maliciously.</p><p>With the joint efforts of several factions, it was clear that Buddhism Bhante had to be concerned about whether they could leave this place safely.</p><p>As brilliance shone from a distance reached the battlefield, Buddhist doctrines and scriptures sounded.</p><p>The Buddhist Bante stayed with Archaic Dipankara Buddha at the Western Pure Lands to maintain the rituals to search for Sakyamuni Sarira previously had dispatched another group of reinforcements.</p><p>Looking at the Green Lotus Treasured Flag that had fallen into Yan Zhaoge’s hands, all the Buddhist bigwigs were silent.</p><p>They tried to retake the flag, but Feng Yunsheng and others intercepted it. Probably, this goal would be unattainable in this event.</p><p>Although there were reinforcements from the periphery, the demon race, orthodox Daoism, and Nine Underworlds might also send their backups.</p><p>Mahamayuri left in his pursuit for Sakyamuni Sarira. Buddhism had been unable to regain the upper hand by continuing to fight. The situation might become more challenging over time.</p><p>After sighing, the Buddhas of Blessed Lands cut off their attachment to the goal and began to seek retreat.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge’s gaze fell on Nie Jingshen.</p><p>Nie Jingshen played a significant role in this competition for the treasure, snatching the Sakyamuni Sarira, delivering it to Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles, and forcing Mahamayuri to retreat. However, after the series of events, he had already retracted his sword and had no intention to participate further.</p><p>In the melee at this moment, he turned around and left here.</p><p>“Brother Nie!” Yan Zhaoge called, but Nie Jingshen didn’t stop.</p><p>Feng Yunsheng looked at Yan Zhaoge. Yan Zhaoge shook his head and chased after Nie Jingshen. She couldn’t help but follow along as well.</p><p>Find out what happens next by getting early access to chapters with Patreon!
