Moreover, the results of the battle would ultimately boil down to brute strength and prowess.</p><p>After Yang Jian’s revelation, all mysteries had come clear.</p><p>Orthodox Daoism was using the trap to their advantage. Despite acknowledging the looming danger churning ahead, they were willing to risk themselves for the sole chance of obtaining the Immortal Ending Sword. In the end, they managed to gather all Immortal Extermination Four Swords and used the Immortal Extermination Formation to their advantage.</p><p>“Yang Jian’s survival and his deception through the Earth Queen was merely another variable.” The Dipankara Archaic Buddha shook his head, “The key here is the Great Sage Equalling Heavens…”</p><p>If not for him, Mahamayuri’s assistance would bestow the Western Pure Lands with a greater chance of success.</p><p>Even if orthodox Daoism had Yang Jian and Suo Mingzhang, they were still forced to face off against a swarm of experts.</p><p>“Pitiable it might be,” The Dipankara Archaic Buddha smiled bitterly, “We were just too weak.”</p><p>Dao Monarch Lu Ya took out most of his trump cards, sacrificing the Immortal Slaying Flying Saber, the Nailhead Seven Arrows Scripture, and the decrepit Qin of Fuxi.</p><p>Similarly, the Dipankara Archaic Buddha and other Buddhists had paid a hefty sum for this event.</p><p>Staring at the location where Mahamayuri left, the Dipankara Archaic Buddha thought of the sarira in the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus’ possession.</p><p>“Let us depart.” All vivid yet complex emotions disappeared from the archaic Buddha’s gaze, and his expression returned to normal, “Today’s matters are merely the foreboding start. The following stages shall now experience huge tremors.”</p><p>“Namo Amitabha.” The Buddhist Bhantes chanted lightly and disappeared by the void together.</p><p>…</p><p>Compared to the other factions filled with resentment and helplessness, the No Hatred Heavens’ Tushita Palace atmosphere was different.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p>His heart which remained tense ever since his realization of the Immortal Ending Sword being with the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord fifty years ago, was finally relieved of any pressure.</p><p>The others were showing similar joyous expressions as well.</p><p>Looking around the Tushita Palace’s hall, they asked Bhikkhu Xuan Du, “Are we able to meet the Elder Lord?”</p><p>“It isn’t my intention to displease you all. However, since the old master never relayed any decree, it isn’t my position to make the choice,” answered Bhikkhu Xuan Du apologetically.</p><p>Yang Jian smiled and said, “Even I had never met the Elder Lord before, despite residing by the Tushita Palace for so many years.”</p><p>The Cloudy Firmament Fairy smiled faintly, “Same as I.”</p><p>“That’s a pity then.” While feeling a little disappointed, they still thanked Yang Jian, the Cloudy Firmament Fairy, and Bhikkhu Xuan Du together, “This time, it’s truly all thanks to you all bestowing your aid. Otherwise, the battle would have definitely ended differently.”</p><p>The three shook their heads, “We’re of the same lineage after all. There’s no need to show us any gratitude. Moreover, since today’s matters involving the future of our Daoism, we can’t possibly neglect it, can we?”</p><p>“With today’s success, our following stance shall become vastly different.” The Cloudy Firmament Fairy said, “However, we still shouldn’t let out guard down. Otherwise, our years of effort might go to waste.”</p><p>As she spoke, she looked toward the jet-black Six Souls Banner.</p><p>The banner was now empty, with no more names inscribed above.</p><p>Even if the Elder Lord didn’t take action, the Immortal Extermination Formation granted orthodox Daoism with the prowess to contend against other grand forces. Even with other Dao Realm bigwigs in the fray, they won’t remain as powerless as before.</p><p>While the Immortal Extermination was still unable to harm Amitabha, the Maitreya Buddha, the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord, the Eastern Sovereign Taiyi, or the Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil, the vassals beneath them would still be deterred by what’s known as history’s most ruthless formation.</p><p>Only, there was still one problem.</p><p>Without techniques like the Six Souls Banner or the Qin of Fuxi, other Dao Ancestors could work together to dismantle the formation and seize the swords away.</p><p>Hence, the Immortal Extermination Formation attacks shall only be unleashed the instant it appears to prevent irregularities from occurring.</p><p>In other words, a one-time opportunity for attacking.</p><p>Only, with the conflicts and hostility prevailing between the grand forces, who would willingly receive the Immortal Extermination Formation’s daunting strike?</p><p>This would give orthodox Daoism a chance.</p><p>This was why Yan Zhaoge, Yang Jian, and the others worked so hard for the Immortal Extermination Formation.</p><p>Ever since the downfall after the Great Calamity, orthodox Daoism’s standing shall now be rewritten.</p><p>“I’m afraid that the old master won’t be thrilled if the Immortal Extermination Formation remains in the Tushita Palace.” Bhikkhu Xuan Du looked at the Cloudy Firmament Fairy and the Incongruence Divine Mother, “We might have to burden you two in the future by maneuvering the formation and blending it into the void’s boundless outskirts while carrying the Green Duckweed Sword.”</p><p>Such was an inevitable matter. Only by remaining in hiding while on constant accumulation would they be able to maintain their deterrence.</p><p>But, the person wielding the swords would have to drift within the void, becoming one with it.</p><p>The Cloudy Firmament Fairy nodded, “We shall take turns with it then. Since senior apprentice-sister Incongruence was wounded, allow me to shoulder the burden for now.”</p><p>The Incongruence Divine Mother, whose presence was still highly frail, nodded, “Thank you.”</p><p>“While no names remain on the Six Souls Banner, the outside world won’t know if new names would be inscribed above.” Yan Zhaoge smiled and said, “Other than that, their judgment toward the Elder Lord’s stance might be even more imprecise and distorted.”</p><p>While orthodox Daoism themselves were incapable of making accurate judgments, the Elder Lord’s silence also implied his acknowledgment of their actions.</p><p>Whether it was merely a bluff or rather a case of menacing pretense, they could use this guise to their advantage.</p><p>Only, there were still some things they had to worry about.</p><p>That was why a group of people came hiding in the No Hatred Heavens, whether they had matters to attend to or not.</p><p>Only during a crucial moment would a blade crafted with refined metal be able to unleash its most enormous value.</p><p>For example, seizing the Immortal Extermination Formation this time.</p><p>“Our Daoism experienced our prime in the past and proceeded to plunge deep into the chasm until now. This truly befits the natural laws of darkness dispersing, mantled by the coming of the light.” Yang Jian smiled and said, “After dwelling around deep in the abyss, it’s about time we ascend to the peak. With the light of glory and hope now shining upon us, as long as we work together as one, that sort of future won’t be too far off from where we stand now.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge grinned while listening to him.</p><p>Just as Yang Jian had said, Daoism was truly a powerful faction during the Middle era.</p><p>Before the heavens split open, the Primordial Heavenly Devil failed to seize the spot of “Primordial” from the Primordial Heavenly Lord. After the heavens were split open, the devil was even oppressed by the Primordial Heavenly Lord during the Primitive era.</p><p>During the Primitive era, three Sovereigns had created and governed over a myriad of races.</p><p>However, the Lord of Dao and Virtue indoctrinated the world with the Daoism teachings, allowing the Human Race to triumph over other races, becoming a leading figure.</p><p>While the Human Race held a deep reverence for the three Sovereigns, their martial arts paths mostly followed the Lord of Dao and Virtue and Daoism’s Three Clears.</p><p>The very first Dao Realm bigwig to perish – the Existence Creation Heavenly Devil was slain by the Lord of Numinous Treasures.</p><p>Long before creation was established, from the primordial gulf of chaos until the Primitive era, the Three Clears Grand Masters had pretty much never suffered any losses.</p><p>“Our progenitors truly had it nice. Guess this fits into our karmic cycle of ups and downs.” Yan Zhaoge held his head with his palm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
