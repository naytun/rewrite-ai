I’ll have to trouble thee for the interaction with the Three Clears Lineage.”</p><p>“I hope for a future where we can work together.” The Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva shook his head and left as he sighed.</p><p>The Dipankara Archaic Buddha watched his silhouette of departure.</p><p>Then, eighteen pearls glittering with five-colored brilliance appeared in front of him.</p><p>Seeing the remaining three-quarters of the Sea Suppressing Pearls, the archaic Buddha shook his head and put on a wry smile. Then, he kept the Sea Suppressing Pearls away.</p><p>Sitting atop the lotus, the Dipankara Archaic Buddha’s expression retained his composure, and his gaze showed no signs of falter. Then, he shut his eyes as if he had returned to dead silence.</p><p>After getting wind of the Three Clears Lineage establishing the cosmos belonging to Daoism, both the Western Pure Lands and the Astro Mountains Starry Seas remained silent.</p><p>The Immortal Court and the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus, who often oppressed orthodox Daoism enthusiastically in the past, didn’t voice any objections.</p><p>Three cosmos belonging to Daoism were exposed by the void’s boundless outskirts, yet other forces seemed to be ignoring their presence.</p><p>Compared to a few thousand years ago, the current dao universe was utterly different from the World beyond Worlds and the Roving Jade Heavens during their establishment period, where they both underwent countless bloodshed.</p><p>After the dark ages orthodox Daoism experienced during the Great Calamity, they finally had a place of respite through the many contributions of countless heirs. Their circumstances now finally allowed them to develop even further.</p><p>Places as hidden and tranquil as the Jade Spring World were of an extreme minority.</p><p>Most of the time, people of Daoism had to survive between the crevices of conflicts.</p><p>While vagrants like Li Xingba and Daoist Crimson Mist were hard to pursue, it was also impossible to establish any noteworthy inception.</p><p>Of course, being experts in the Immortal Realm, living far away from civilization was no problem.</p><p>However, the procedure of picking and nurturing their successors meant that they had to return to civilization, back to where most mortals resided.</p><p>Only with sufficient populations could some exceptional talents emerge.</p><p>Only with a foundation sturdy enough would these prodigies appear incessantly.</p><p>Today, the orthodox Daoism lineage didn’t have to worry about this problem any longer.</p><p>Suo Mingzhang, the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor, the North Star Emperor, the Incongruence Divine Mother, and the other Daoism Heavenly Lords didn’t have to continue drifting within the void’s boundless outskirts for the sake of concealing themselves into obscurity.</p><p>The establishment of their cave manor and their present reposeful style of living implied that they could pass down more martial arts insights. After all, more populations were surrounding them, allowing for a broader world-building.</p><p>From now onward, even if Daoism’s martial art practitioners weren’t completely safe from the void’s boundless outskirts, they didn’t have to remain in hiding any longer in case others besieged them.</p><p>More resources and more treasures had been opened up to them. Of course, whether they could win against other forces or not was a different matter, but at the very least, they could now compete openly using their prowesses.</p><p>They didn’t have to worry about more higher-level foes suddenly appearing, with no bigwigs backing them up.</p><p>Dao Ancestors were the highest extent of threat coming from other forces. Without a Dao Ancestor presiding over Daoism’s martial arts practitioners last time, those of Daoism was forced into an extremely awkward position.</p><p>While there still wasn’t any, the Immortal Extermination Formation had changed this status quo.</p><p>Indeed, the situation was now entirely different.</p><p>Watching Suo Mingzhang bring away the Canghua Divine Tree created through Shao Junhuang’s corpse, Yan Zhaoge, and the others felt a sense of emotion swirling within them.</p><p>The present was what all Daoism seniors wished for after the Great Calamity. People like Shao Junhuang worked hard to achieve this current state.</p><p>The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step forward. It was precisely due to the efforts contributed through countless generations that the light of hope managed to glow brighter and brighter. Finally, the incandescence shone like the rising sun, purging away the darkness and frigidness hindering their advances.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge spread his palm, and a faint glimmer arose. It gradually expanded larger and larger, forming a huge circle of luminance.</p><p>As the radiances dispersed, a black iron wheel appeared in Yan Zhaoge’s hand, with twelves holes carved within the wheel’s surface.</p><p>The Dim Radiant Wheel.</p><p>The enormous black iron wheel continued to spin without end. Suddenly, somber-blue flowers grew from the short Canghua Divine Tree, taking roots in the Bright Connection Valley. Without any warnings, they all started blossoming.</p><p>The blue petals swayed across the air and fell upon the black iron wheel like snow.</p><p>Yan Di extended his finger, a glint of red radiance appeared by the tip of his finger. The red radiances expanded and enveloped the entire Bright Connection Valley.</p><p>This red radiance originated from the Immortal Trapping Sword. After being sundered by Yan Di, he had always brought it along with him wherever he went.</p><p>Dark-red radiances formed into a light screen, with an image forever embedded within.</p><p>A man in purple and a woman in white stood side by side, their backs facing Yan Zhaoge and the others.</p><p>The man in purple wielded a sword with his left hand, while the woman in white in her right; their other empty hands were clasped together tightly.</p><p>Other than the silhouette currently being projected, they could still see the two’s heads facing each other, with the corner of their lips curling upward.</p><p>These were the final recordings that the Immortal Trapping Sword had of Yan Di’s parents – Yan Xintang and Di Qinglian before their passing.</p><p>The Sword Buddha initially within the projection was erased by Yan Di, leaving only his parents intact.</p><p>Yan Xintang and Di Qinglian conducted a blood ritual along with the Jade Cauldron cadaver and the Immortal Trapping Sword, which resulted in the disintegration of their corpses. Hence, Yan Di could only use this dark-red sword-light as a form of memorial, which accompanied him at all times.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge, Feng Yunsheng, Yan Di, Xue Chuqing, and Xu Fei bowed solemnly.</p><p>“Grandfather, grandmother, Exalted Wood Luminary, Senior Dim Radiant, Bright Connection, and all other elders of Daoism, your efforts of the past were not to no avail.”</p><p>“We… succeeded!” Yan Zhaoge whispered.</p><p>During and after the Great Calamity, countless experts of Daoism had perished.</p><p>Through Yang Jian, the Cloudy Firmament Fairy, the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor, and Bhikkhu Xuan Du, Yan Zhaoge more or less knew the details pertaining to the Great Calamity.</p><p>Needless to say, the Lord of Broad Accomplishment, the Jade Cauldron Cultivated Deity, the Lord of Daoist Ways, and other bigwigs of the Jade Clear lineage had all suffered from tragic deaths.</p><p>Among the four Imperials of the Heavenly Court’s Divine Palace, the Earth Queen had perished.</p><p>Among the Ladies of the Three Skies, other than the Cloudy Firmament Fairy, the Nephrite Empyrean Fairy, and the Jade Sky Fairy could not escape their fate of death.</p><p>The former Prime Clear lineage top-notch bigwig, the Golden Spirit Mother of the Heavenly Court’s Divine Palace’s Big Dipper Agency, also perished.</p><p>Wen Zhong was the third-generational heir of the Prime Clear lineage during the Ancient era. He later became the leader of the Heavenly Court’s Divine Palace’s Thunder Agency and bore the title of the Nine Heavens Yingyuan Thunder Illumination Heavenly Lord. Unfortunately, he had soon followed after the Golden Spirit Mother’s footsteps and passed away.</p><p>The original owner of the twenty-four Sea Suppressing Pearls – the Prime Clear bigwig Zhao Gongming managed to liberate himself from the Investiture Gods rankings during the Great Calamity but met the same fate as the Nephrite Empyrean Fairy and the Jade Sky Fairy.</p><p>The Zhenwu Devil Sweeping Heavenly Lord, Longevity God Lord, the Venus Star Lord… and countless other experts were dragged within the flames of war, never to see another day of light.</p><p>Some met their demise during the Great Calamity, while some perished after the Great Calamity when they attempted to bring Daoism back to its state of prime. During the previous contest for the Immortal Extermination Formation, the Incongruence Divine Mother had almost joined them.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge stared at the backs of Yan Xintang and Di Qinglian.</p><p>He looked at the Dim Radiant Wheel formed by Yi Tianxia’s corpse.</p><p>He looked at the Canghua Divine Tree formed by Hu Yuexin’s corpse.</p><p>Watching the silhouettes gradually emerging in front of him, he also felt a sense of relief while lamenting for them.</p><p>“While we are still unable to cleanse the world of the tarnished stains and annihilate the heretics along with other forces, our Daoism is already showing signs of flourishing.” Yan Zhaoge said, “Prosperity shall arrive, just as you all had hoped for.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
