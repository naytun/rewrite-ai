Hence, they would be issues when they were unlisted from the investiture.</p><p>After Kui Mulang broke free from the restrictions from the Investiture of Gods, he unexpectedly overcame the Origin Heavenly Tribulation and attained the Grand Heavenly Realm. To the public’s eye, it was simply a miracle.</p><p>As a matter of fact, he didn’t convert to be a heretic to achieve Grand Heavenly Realm.</p><p>Moreover, he was in the same generation as the famous Mu Zha family, who were still stuck at the Grand Virtual Immortal realm.</p><p>He just showed up with the Bull Demon King, Drake-Headed Immortal, and other Great Demons, competing for Sakyamuni Sarira.</p><p>In the previous event, Mahamayuri arrived and defeated the demons group. Kui Mulang, like other Great Demons, could hardly stop Mahamayuri.</p><p>Later, Nie Jingshen and the Nine Underworlds Devil group appeared. In the meantime, Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles came in surprise and seized the Sakyamuni Sarira. After Mahamayuri was lured away, Kui Mulang also evacuated with other Great Demons.</p><p>In the presence of a top bigwig powerhouse like Mahamayuri, Kui Mulang naturally appeared unremarkable. Despite so, Yan Zhaoge had placed attention on him already.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge heard that Kui Mulang, one of the twenty-eight constellations, possessed Soul Dissevering Jade when he was still in Heavenly Court’s Divine Palace Martial Repository.</p><p>At the time, Yan Zhaoge didn’t care much about this piece of news at all.</p><p>However, with his robust spiritual power and solid memory, all the news he had heard and the things he had experienced would be engraved deeply. He had achieved the state of no forgetting and always stored pieces of information for future uses.</p><p>When Yu Ye needed to be treated, Yan Zhaoge immediately recalled the past event when Soul Dissevering Jade was mentioned.</p><p>Unfortunately, there was no news from Kui Mulang back in time. Yan Zhaoge thought he had perished in Great Calamity a long time ago, so he had been looking for Soul Dissevering Jade through other channels.</p><p>With Kui Mulang emerging again, Yan Zhaoge naturally paid close attention.</p><p>Even though Yan Zhaoge was uncertain whether the Soul Dissevering Jade was still in Kui Mulang’s hands, this was a much reliable clue than searching for a needle in a haystack.</p><p>Hence, although he went to chase Nie Jingshen and Feng Yunsheng, he dedicated the North Ocean clone to trail Kui Mulang secretly.</p><p>“Has he returned to Astro Mountains Starry Sea?” Feng Yunsheng asked.</p><p>The corners of Yan Zhaoge’s mouth raised slightly, “Not yet.”</p><p>Feng Yunsheng smiled in response.</p><p>If Kui Mulang returned to the Astro Mountains Starry Sea and hid within, Yan Zhaoge wouldn’t be able to confront him directly.</p><p>The living environment of orthodox Daoism was much different from the past, much more relaxed.</p><p>Yes, there wouldn’t be an issue for Yan Zhaoge to openly visit the Astro Mountains Starry Sea.</p><p>However, this approach to acquiring the Soul Dissevering Jade was tantamount to asking a favor which would put Yan Zhaoge’s group in a disadvantageous spot.</p><p>When the time comes, even if Kui Mulang asked for a higher price, Yan Zhaoge would be in a passive spot and have more difficulties bargaining for a fairer price.</p><p>So if there was a way to contact Kui Mulang privately with the situation not widely known, it was naturally better for Yan Zhaoge and the rest.</p><p>“Kui Mulang is currently focusing on the battle between the heretics of Blessed Lands of the White Lotus and Immortal Court.” Yan Zhaoge explained.</p><p>Due to the presence of orthodox Daoism and Nine Underworlds, the demon races and Western Pure Lands had scruples to engage in another conflict again.</p><p>However, for the battle between Blessed Lands of the White Lotus and Immortal Court, the orthodox Buddha faction and demon races faction had always paid close attention. They had bigwigs monitoring on the frontline to respond optimally to any sudden changes.</p><p>It occurred that Kui Mulang was one of the Great Demons garrisoned in the frontline.</p><p>“Let’s take a look at it first. We don’t need to be in a rush to contact him,” said Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>Although Yan Zhaoge and Roving Jade Heavens people had searched for treasures such as Soul Dissevering Jade, Sanguinary Stone Marrow, and Verve Sea Essence over the years in a somewhat secretive manner, there was a possibility that other factions had noticed it.</p><p>In case the demon races deliberately arranged a trap accordingly, Yan Zhaoge and the group would want to avoid it for sure.</p><p>Hence, Yan Zhaoge wasn’t in a hurry but sent the North Ocean clone to shadow the target. His main body and Feng Yunsheng brought the Green Lotus Treasured Flag back to their territory together, seeking Suo Mingzhang’s help.</p><p>“I shall await your arrangement.” Feng Yunsheng nodded.</p><p>The trio stood together under the Canghua Heavenly Tree, looking at the Green Lotus Treasured Flag in Suo Mingzhang’s hand with its stains faded gradually.</p><p>It didn’t come instantly like fast food. Even with Suo Mingzhang’s capability, the cleansing needed to be carried out gradually.</p><p>Fortunately, Yan Zhaoge and the rest weren’t in a hurry. Instead, they chatted with Suo Mingzhang on the martial art theories while waiting for further news from the North Ocean clone.</p><p>…</p><p>The North Ocean Clone was at proximity where the two heretics, Blessed Lands of the White Lotus and Immortal Court, were at war.</p><p>He was no longer human but altered his appearance into a Great Demon, hiding in the pitch-black void.</p><p>The Golden Body of the Great Sage had been influencing the North Ocean Clone over the years so that Yan Zhaoge’s cultivation strength was as mystical as Xu Fei and Pan Pan.</p><p>Therefore, he changed into the appearance of a demon race at the Grand Heavenly Realm to avoid revealing flaws of his disguise.</p><p>Of course, he deliberately stayed away from those demon races’ Great Sage and didn’t go to hang around in front of others.</p><p>The North Ocean Clone might expose himself under a close distance and interact with the foes.</p><p>Given the situation, it wasn’t quite convenient for the clone to monitor Kui Mulang. However, the target didn’t seem to be in any way particular nor deliberately hiding his trace. Hence, the clone managed to trail him all the time.</p><p>“At present, it seems that there is nothing special. Is it because the demon races don’t know that we are looking for Soul Dissevering Jade, or they don’t know that Kui Mulang possesses the Soul Dissevering Jade?” Yan Zhaoge thought deeply in his mind.</p><p>This possibility was undeniable. Kui Mulang left Heavenly Court’s Divine Palace and joined the Astro Mountains Starry Sea without reporting all his assets to the Astro Mountains Starry Sea.</p><p>Among the demon races in the Astro Mountains Starry Sea, it seemed expected to have no one had learned about Soul Dissevering Jade before.</p><p>For orthodox Daoism who wanted to treat Yu Ye, Soul Dissevering Jade was important. However, this rare treasure wasn’t shocking for the others, including Kui Mulang.</p><p>It seemed that the demand determined the value.</p><p>“I just hope that Soul Dissevering Jade is still in his hands, or he at least knows the treasure’s whereabouts.” Yan Zhaoge mumbled in his heart.</p><p>While paying attention to Kui Mulang’s movement, he observed the battle between Blessed Lands of the White Lotus and Immortal Court.</p><p>Suo Mingzhang and Yan Zhaoge severely hurt the Immortal Court in recent years. Its implication had continued to this day.</p><p>“However, the heretics supplement on manpower is quite fast.” Yan Zhaoge strolled around the area. As two hundred years have passed, most of the Immortal Court’s human resources lost at the Grand Virtual Immortal Realm have been replenished.</p><p>It was just that even for the Immortal Court, they couldn’t replenish the lost powerhouses at the Grand Heavenly Immortal Realm under a couple of centuries.</p><p>So overall, Blessed Lands of the White Lotus had the upper hand.</p><p>Sure enough, they were also the side provoking this war.</p><p>With little participation from the demon races and Western Pure Lands, Blessed Lands of the White Lotus had the upper hand, but Immortal Court wasn’t entirely lacking the power to retaliate.</p><p>The North Ocean clone was observing the situation. He suddenly noticed that Kui Mulang, his primary target, had made a move at this time.</p><p>Find out what happens next by getting early access to chapters with Patreon!
