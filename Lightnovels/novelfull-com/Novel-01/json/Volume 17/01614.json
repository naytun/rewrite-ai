That was until the Great Calamity transpired, and Daoism declined to the state of ruination.</p><p>After rummaging through the universe, the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor finally located the Triratna Jade Scepter.</p><p>Later, he also used its abilities when establishing the World beyond Worlds.</p><p>Only, due to the pressure imposed by the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord and the Immortal Court, said treasure ultimately befell into the North Star Emperor’s hands.</p><p>The Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor attempted to reclaim this treasure, accompanied by Gao Han and Ling Qing.</p><p>During Suo Mingzhang’s ascent to the Grand Heavenly Realm, when Yan Zhaoge split the World beyond Worlds into two, Gao Han and Ling Qing attempted to retrieve the Triratna Jade Scepter for the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor, but were only met with failure later on.</p><p>Now that the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor could finally reclaim this scepter, he would not let go of this chance.</p><p>However, he wasn’t the main command of today’s battlefield. There were many crucial matters where his words alone wouldn’t hold enough weight. While it wouldn’t necessarily upset others, he would like to negate such risk, especially in the current situation where Daoism was required to be united as one.</p><p>Gao Han’s act of sneaking into the Heavenly River, looming around in search of the treasure, was already somewhat detestable.</p><p>After the Incongruence Divine Mother suffered from grave injuries, Yan Zhaoge and Gao Qingxuan gained control over the Immortal Extermination Formation. If Gao Han weren’t present when the Heavenly River was pulled into the formation, the Immortal Slaying Flying Saber and the Triratna Jade Scepter would naturally fall into Yan Zhaoge and Gao Qingxuan’s possession.</p><p>While Yan Zhaoge wouldn’t necessarily keep the Triratna Jade Scepter away from the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor due to his connection with Shao Junhuang and Xue Chuqing’s lineage, Gao Han and he sought for a hundred percent chance of retrieving this treasure, hence their method of conduct.</p><p>Being the disadvantageous side of this exchange, the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor had to relinquish something of equal worth to Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>Currently, Yan Zhaoge had Feng Yunsheng, Yan Di, Xu Fei, and the others backing him, which deterred the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor from inciting any provocations.</p><p>The Sea Suppressing Pearl was the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor’s compensation and apology.</p><p>At the same time, he didn’t keep the Immortal Slaying Flying Saber to himself and instead bequeathed the gourd to Yang Jian.</p><p>This was in line with everyone’s expectations.</p><p>While no one could ever hope to activate this Immortal Slaying Flying Saber without Dao Monarch Lu Ya’s secret martial arts, even if someone managed to do so in the distant future, nobody would ever show any desire in using this treasure.</p><p>Even if it was proven that this treasure wasn’t an absolute counter to Yang Jian.</p><p>However, it posed some threats to him still. If one insisted on taking the Immortal Slaying Flying Saber, what would Yang Jian think?</p><p>If it were given to Yang Jian, it wouldn’t prove much use as well. With how almighty Yang Jian was, if he could not take down an enemy, the Immortal Slaying Flying Saber would also prove useless.</p><p>“My destiny seems to intertwine with this treasure of Lu Ya.” Yang Jian already held some apprehension toward the Immortal Slaying Flying Saber. The further he advanced, the more fearless he would be when facing it. However, even so, he didn’t choose to reject but instead took the gourd over with a smile.</p><p>Then, Yang Jian opened his palm, taking out a Sea Suppressing Pearl enshrouded within a glisten of five-colored brilliance.</p><p>“Whenever I’m not in the Tushita Palace, I’d always be drifting around the void. As for now, I still haven’t made the decision to reopen my cave manor. Since this Sea Suppressing Pearl is pretty much useless to me, I ought to give it to those in need,” said Yang Jian with a smile.</p><p>He looked at the Incongruence Divine Mother, “The Divine Mother was injured gravely for our Daoism’s Immortal Extermination Formation and should now be focusing on healing. No matter if it’s for establishing a cosmos for your rejuvenation or educating the younglings of the Prime Clear lineage, I’m sure this treasure would be of use to you.”</p><p>In this battle, the Dipankara Archaic Buddha had lost a total of six Sea Suppressing Pearls.</p><p>The Immortal Extermination Formation didn’t suck in these Sea Suppressing Pearls along with the Heavenly River.</p><p>Before that, Yang Jian, the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor, Feng Yunsheng, Suo Mingzhang, Bhikkhu Xuan Du, and the North Star Emperor had both taken one each.</p><p>This time around, the North Star Emperor let down all past grudges and came to aid in emergency times. Yet, he lost the Triratna Jade Scepter, not to his enemies, but his ally. No matter what, this seemed like an unjust outcome.</p><p>However, back when he acquired the Triratna Jade Scepter, his relationship with the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor had already turned into a complicated mess.</p><p>The current him was just like the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor back then.</p><p>The grudges between the two were far too elaborate for anyone else to interfere.</p><p>Obtaining the Sea Suppressing Pearl was more or less consolation to him.</p><p>This time, the entirety of Daoism managed to acquire the entire Immortal Extermination Formation and benefitted as a whole. Even the North Star Emperor was no exception.</p><p>“This Sea Suppression Pearl is of no use to me as well.” Seeing the Incongruence Divine Mother receive Yang Jian’s Sea Suppressing Pearl, Bhikkhu Xuan Du also took out the pearl he obtained and told the Cloudy Firmament Fairy, “You can use this as the foundation of re-establishing your Three Immortal Island lineage.”</p><p>The Cloudy Firmament Fairy accepted the pearl without acting melodramatically. As the five-colored radiances shone across her face, she entered a momentary state of trance.</p><p>The original owner of the twenty-four Sea Suppressing Pearls was Zhao Minggong, a bigwig of the Prime Clear Severing Sect. In the past, the two used to regard each other as brothers and sisters.</p><p>After Zhao Minggong met his demise, all Sea Suppressing Pearls fell into the hands of Daoist Dipankara, also known as the current Dipankara Archaic Buddha.</p><p>While looking at the Sea Suppressing Pearl, the Cloudy Firmament Fairy was overwhelmed with a sense of remembrance and couldn’t help but reminisce about her brother.</p><p>She sighed softly and said, “Right now, only I remain in the Three Immortal Island. Since senior apprentice-sister Incongruence has to undergo healing, allow me to bring the Immortal Extermination Formation into the void for now. After senior apprentice-sister Incongruence replaces my duty, only will I consider that matter.”</p><p>Everyone else sympathized with her.</p><p>Among the three ladies of the Three Immortal Island – the Cloudy Firmament, the Nephrite Empyrean, and the Jade Sky, only the Cloudy Firmament remained.</p><p>As the Heavenly Court’s Divine Palace fell to ruination after the Great Calamity, some regained their freedom, but some also fell along with the palace.</p><p>The Nephrite Empyrean Fairy and Jade Sky Fairy were categorized in the latter.</p><p>The Ladies of the Three Skies cherished each other deeply. Thinking about her two deceased sisters, the Cloudy Firmament Fairy’s expression was filled with great sorrow.</p><p>“The matters of the Immortal Extermination Formation should be done as soon as possible. After making some arrangements, I shall take action immediately. Of course, I still require some assistance from you all.” The Cloudy Firmament Fairy organized her emotions quickly.</p><p>Everyone said in unison, “Our gratitude for your assistance.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge stashed away the Sea Suppressing Pearl obtained from the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor.</p><p>Intricate marvelousness was hidden deep within the pearl. While it seemed insignificant when glanced from afar, it bore immense weight when held in hand.</p><p>If the Sea Suppressing Pearl’s strength were to be released thoroughly, its mass would become even more monumental.</p><p>With a total of twenty-four, one single Sea Suppressing Pearl alone seemed trivial.</p><p>However, its five-colored radiances could catch enemies off guard and penetrate most defenses. Thus, the descent of a single pearl alone was able to oppress a large majority of foes.</p><p>The only reason why it had no effects on Suo Mingzhang was that Suo Mingzhang was far too strong.</p><p>Moreover, this pearl wasn’t used just for the sake of fighting. If the space within was released, an entire world would be manifested, with its size being even more extensive than the Awakened Sky Cosmos.</p><p>At the same time, a myriad of objects would be produced, enabling the production of countless resources. After a thorough adjustment, an autarky world would be created.</p><p>The saying of Dipankara Archaic Buddha possessing twenty-four heavens and twenty-four Blessed Lands originated from here.</p><p>Feng Yunsheng obtained one, while Yan Zhaoge obtained another. Such an outcome would have a significant impact on the Awakened Sky Cosmos.</p><p>Moreover, the harvests of Yan Zhaoge and the others from this battle weren’t just limited to these.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
