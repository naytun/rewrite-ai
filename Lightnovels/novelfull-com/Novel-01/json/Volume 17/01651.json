If Gao Han had cooperated with Western Pure Lands in the dark, it would sabotage his previous efforts. Therefore, he might not agree to do so,” said Feng Yunsheng.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge threw his hands up and said with a smile, “This will be a good opportunity to test the Exalted Solar Luminary on which side he is supporting deep down in his heart.”</p><p>Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor and Gao Han undoubtedly stood on the orthodox Daoism side in the battle for the Immortal Extermination Formation as they worked together with the Three Clear Lineages.</p><p>But this still didn’t prove that Gao Han had no other plans.</p><p>“We need to let the Southern Emperor know about this.” Feng Yunsheng said while Yan Zhaoge nodded at the side, “Of course.”</p><p>It wasn’t easy to get into contact in the endless void outside their world. Yan Zhaoge and Feng Yunsheng weren’t in a hurry. They gradually move to the universe near Western Pure Lands.</p><p>Of course, the two weren’t too close to the Western Pure Lands, with a few layers of voids separating them from that universe.</p><p>Thanks to both of them being proficient at hiding. Otherwise, even if they controlled the distance, the Buddhist bigwigs such as Archaic Dipankara Buddha and Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva in Western Pure Lands would still sense something was odd.</p><p>The couple waited patiently. They were also quietly keeping an eye out for any special people coming in and out of Western Pure Lands.</p><p>After waiting for a while, Yan Zhaoge’s heart moved slightly, “Gao Han sent a message. He is nearby.”</p><p>Feng Yunsheng nodded and left with Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>After the two advanced for a while, they stopped at another cosmic world.</p><p>In the void, the faint blue light was creeping on the darkness. Then, a man in white gradually emerged from it. It was the long-lost Exalted Solar Luminary, Gao Han.</p><p>He concurrently studied the Supreme Martial Arts of the sun and the moon. He manifested the boundless darkness before the world was created. His level of stealth wasn’t inferior to the Exalted Rahu Luminary Jian Shunhua of the same cultivation realm.</p><p>Concealed Ketu Star wasn’t as fierce as Rahu Star, but more quiet and hidden. From the perspective of martial art technique, Rahu Star was better at offense, and Concealed Ketu Star was better at defense.</p><p>Of course, Gao Han’s attacks were equally sharp. The sun signified being imposing and ardent. Under the cosmos, it was an elite martial art technique.</p><p>“My virtuous juniors, how have you been?” Gao Han smiled and arched his hands at Yan Zhaoge and Feng Yunsheng.</p><p>“Exalted Solar Luminary is overpolite.” Yan Zhaoge also smiled, “Presumably, you already know what happened. I wonder if you have any solution?”</p><p>Gao Han’s expression was unfazed, “If it is really about Sakyamuni Sarira, then this competition is worth our intervention. I will try my best.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said, “Western Pure Lands will definitely prevent Mahamayuri from receiving news of it.”</p><p>“Yes, it’s worth it to make it happen even if there is a high price to pay.” Gao Han said, “For the time being, I’m still thinking of a solution. Junior, how about you follow me over? Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor is here too.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge and Feng Yunsheng raised their eyebrows slightly, “ <i>Oh?</i> “</p><p>Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor offered his Sea Suppressing Pearl because of Triratna Jade Sceptre. He didn’t open up a cave manor, unlike Suo Mingzhang, North Star Emperor, Incongruence Divine Mother, Cloudy Firmament Fairy.</p><p>However, as far as Yan Zhaoge knows, the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor had instructed Gao Han and Ling Qing to open up new cosmos, cultivate newcomers, and extend his lineage.</p><p>He had dedicated himself to wandering in the endless void, searching for Three Clear Lineage’s brethren and the various exotic treasures that had gone missing since the past.</p><p>Recently, he mainly searched for the Earthly Yin Yang Apricot Banner with Yang Jian and others.</p><p><i>The emperor rushed over after receiving the news. Is it because of Sakyamuni Sarira, or is it because I have put the matter about Gao Han contacting Buddhism on the table?</i></p><p>Yan Zhaoge thought deeply in his heart, but his face was unfazed. He nodded immediately, “ <i>Oh</i> , Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor is also here? Then, no matter what Western Pure Lands is planning, we’re well prepared for it.”</p><p>“We will meet the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor. I need to depend on the matters here to Exalted Solar Luminary.”</p><p>After Yan Zhaoge said, he arched his hands, bid farewell to Gao Han, and left with Feng Yunsheng.</p><p>After leaving for a while, Feng Yunsheng moved her gaze around, “Over there.”</p><p>The void still seemed silent, but Yan Zhaoge could vaguely feel the thundershocks there.</p><p>Sure enough, after approaching, there seemed to be an invisible curtain before his eyes.</p><p>After crossing over, he saw the unhidden thunder and lightning.</p><p>“Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor, it’s been a long time.” Yan Zhaoge arched his hands. Feng Yunsheng also nodded and said, “Senior Daoist Southern, how have you been?”</p><p>An old man wearing a crown and a Daoist attire appeared atop the thunder carriage. It was the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor.</p><p>He got off the thunder carriage and nodded in return, “My virtuous brother, your demeanor is better than ever.”</p><p>His voice was as shocking as a thunderclap in the sky, purging the sins and karma of the world. At the same time, it was as soft as a gentle wind and drizzle, nurturing nature silently.</p><p>The two contradictory vibes intertwined, giving a unique charm.</p><p>“Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor, you have praised me too much.” Yan Zhaoge asked, “Since I last heard from you, we still don’t know the Earthly Yin Yang Apricot Banner’s whereabouts. I wonder how the situation is now?”</p><p>“Currently, there is still little gain.” The Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor lamented, “Compared with the illusory goal, this place is more eye-catching.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge and Feng Yunsheng nodded silently.</p><p>“Little Friend Yan, you have condensed the Splendor of Soul. That’s gratifying.” The Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor said, “After the Great Calamity, you and your father are the closest to the Grand Heavenly Realm after Fellow Daoist Suo and the Fellow Daoist Feng.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said, “Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor, you’re too courteous. The closer we’re to the Dao Realm, the more difficult it is. My generation can only search our path slowly.”</p><p>“I’m just lucky to have the chance and the timing on my side. Senior Daoist Southern, you have praised me too much,” said Feng Yunsheng as well.</p><p>Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor shook his head, “My virtuous junior, you’re undermining your brilliance.”</p><p>He looked at Yan Zhaoge again and asked, “I wonder how your father is doing now?”</p><p>“My father is still cultivating in Zhuluo Royal Reed Heavens to further his martial arts,” replied Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor nodded slightly, “I’m relief that Yan Xintang’s descendants are prospering.”</p><p>“Before you came, have you met with Senior Taiyi?” Yan Zhaoge asked.</p><p>Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor was a direct disciple of Jade Clear’s Patriarch Primordial Heavenly Lord. He was legitimate in the same graduation as the Taiyi Cultivated Deity.</p><p>“I haven’t visited him yet. Probably after this matter, I’m going to meet with Junior Brother Taiyi. Regarding Ne Zha, I have heard that Junior Brother Taiyi is currently working hard on it.” Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor said, “However, it’s great to hear that the teacher and disciple are still alive.”</p><p>Several people were chatting while waiting for Gao Han’s news.</p><p>Gao Han’s movements were agile. After a while, he came back to meet Yan Zhaoge, Feng Yunsheng, and Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor.</p><p>Find out what happens next by getting early access to chapters with Patreon!
