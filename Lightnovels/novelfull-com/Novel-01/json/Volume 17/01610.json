This was practically a grand event unprecedented after the Great Calamity.</p><p>Even so, while many differing variables existed in this matter, the general development of the situation was still within everyone’s expectations.</p><p>Until the moment when the Cloudy Firmament Fairy appeared out of the blue.</p><p>Her appearance alone wasn’t really of any concern. However, with her appearance, it implied that the Six Souls Banner had been in orthodox Daoism’s hands all along.</p><p>How could the Dipankara Archaic Buddha and the others not have the urge to cough out blood with harrowing despondency?</p><p>The first thought in the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles’ head was to crush the Dingguang Joyous Buddha to bits.</p><p>What do you mean by ‘The Six Souls Banner could still be in the Roving Jade Heavens?’</p><p>The Dipankara Archaic Buddha took in a deep breath, “I did not sense the Roving Jade Palace’s appearance. Does that mean this treasure was never in the Roving Jade Palace from the start?”</p><p>“Being able to hide it from us, from the Dingguang Joyous Buddha, and even the few Dao Ancestors. If so, one possibility remains… The Six Souls Banner had been in the Tushita Palace all this while!”</p><p>Everyone’s thoughts drifted much further, “Was it placed in the Tushita Palace before the Three Clears Grand Masters transcended, or did the Elder Lord place it in the Tushita Palace after their transcendence?”</p><p>“The Cloudy Firmament Fairy should have been healing in the Tushita Palace alongside Yang Jian. Was her arrival of her own will without the Elder Lord’s interference, or was she heeding the Elder Lord’s behest?”</p><p>“What is the Elder Lord thinking of? Is he going to make his move? Is he already here?”</p><p>A manifold of thoughts flashed across everyone’s minds.</p><p>However, the more striking scene currently transpiring was the Cloudy Firmament Fairy solemnly praying toward the banner the instant she appeared.</p><p>Above the skies, as the four Dao Ancestors were on the verge of descent, the Six Souls Banner started swaying.</p><p>“Only Dao Ancestors can inscribe names onto the Six Souls Banner!” As they thought of this, they quickly stared at the banner.</p><p>By the six edges of the banner, three of them were empty.</p><p>As for the other remaining three, there were three different names inscribed by each edge, respectively.</p><p>“Amitabha!”</p><p>“East Sovereign Taiyi!”</p><p>“Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil!”</p><p>As the Cloudy Firmament Fairy invoked, the Six Souls Banner started wavering. As its six edges continued fluttering, rays of dusky radiances arose.</p><p>The dusky radiances blended in with the void. Even as they shone, no traces of them could be seen.</p><p>Nebulous ripples appeared within this world of creation.</p><p>Amidst the fluctuations, formless swords seemed to have surged within the boundless and supernal plane, traversing through the layers of cosmos.</p><p>Within the Nine Underworlds, in the deepest yet seemingly at the vertex layer of the bottomless Abyss of Devilish Sea, an ancient jet-black mirror appeared. As mirror lights flickered, they obstructed the amorphous sword from advancing further.</p><p>With the black mirror’s command, the entire Nine Underworlds seemed to have trembled along, repelling that amorphous sword together.</p><p>Atop the Immortal Extermination Formation, the jade door, and the white lotus weren’t affected in the slightest.</p><p>However, the green lotus and the ancient bell stopped their descent.</p><p>The green lotus bloomed with a sarira flickering with radiance.</p><p>The ancient bell tolled, its peals reverberating amidst the countless skies.</p><p>Just like the Ancient Investitures of the Gods war, the Six Souls Banner blemished no harm against Dao Realm bigwigs.</p><p>However, Amitabha and the Eastern Sovereign Taiyi’s descent were halted due to the Six Souls Banner’s interruption.</p><p>If the Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil were also present, he would also be interrupted by the Six Souls Banner.</p><p>Just as what Yan Zhaoge said to Dao Monarch Lu Ya, other than the Qin of Fuxi traded from Dao Monarch Lu Ya, they prepared other “strings” as well.</p><p>Each “string” would only take effect once.</p><p>Right now, several “strings” snapped simultaneously, interrupting the actions of several Dao Ancestors!</p><p>While Amitabha and Eastern Sovereign Taiyi were interrupted, the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord and the Future Buddha continued their descent without any constraints.</p><p>However, as the Cloudy Firmament Fairy was invoking the Six Souls Banner, Yan Zhaoge and the others weren’t just laying around idly.</p><p>Within the Immortal Extermination Formation, Gao Qingxuan and her clone leaped at the same time, wielding the Green Duckweed Sword together and pointing it toward the distant skies.</p><p>Outside the Immortal Extermination Formation, Bhikkhu Xuan Du flipped over his ten extremities crane hat.</p><p>An opening suddenly appeared by the distant skies. Fragrance permeated, and celestial requiems resounded as if the path toward an ethereal paradisiacal land had opened up.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge formed hand seals with his hands, causing the four podiums within the Immortal Extermination Formation to be pulled out from the ground, shooting straight toward the skies. They amalgamated together with the Green Duckweed Sword. With that, the Immortal Extermination Formation soared toward the ether where an opening stood agape.</p><p>As the sword formation soared, it pulled in Yang Jian, Yan Di, the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor, and the Cloudy Firmament Fairy along with the Six Souls Banner.</p><p>The jet-black banner continued fluttering, yet the names inscribed above had vanished.</p><p>The jade door and the white lotus stood in their way, hindering the Immortal Extermination Formation’s advancement.</p><p>Vicious qis skyrocketed from the Immortal Extermination Formation, causing sword-lights to surge.</p><p>While the vicious qi posed no danger to the jade door and the white lotus podium, it continued the ascent of the formation.</p><p>The jade door and the white lotus barged into the formation, with treasured lights and Buddha lights seizing toward the swords hanging by the formation’s doors.</p><p>However, the four swords moved in unison. The formation underwent a transformation, and the podiums shifted locations. The doors flipped upside down, deflecting the two Dao Realm bigwigs’ treasured lights and Buddha lights, preventing them from seizing any swords.</p><p>An illusory palm suddenly extended from the white jade door. Brushing aside the horrifying sword qis, which eradicated creation and recreated the phenomena of chaos, the palm grabbed straight toward the Green Duckweed Sword!</p><p>The Green Duckweed Sword swayed within the void and concealed itself within the jade radiances and yellow mists of the formation, enshrouding itself within the veil of obscurity.</p><p>The palm extended from the white jade door was unable to grab onto the Green Duckweed Sword.</p><p>The white lotus podium enlarged into an immense size, blotting the vast plains and occupying the entire formation.</p><p>Rays of Buddha lights unfolded. Locking on to the Immortal Extermination Formation, it dragged the formation downward.</p><p>The Immortal Extermination Formation halted mid-air momentarily.</p><p>However, at the next moment, countless sword qis surged, diminishing the rays of Buddha lights.</p><p>The entire formation continued rushing toward the green firmament.</p><p>All of a sudden, the scenery changed, and they reached an ethereal celestial realm.</p><p>Within the celestial realm, a normal-looking palace was erected.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
