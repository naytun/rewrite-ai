He rarely left his cave manor at Astro Mountains Starry Sea up until recently.</p><p>This was the first time he faced Immortal Court’s heretics, but he wasn’t blind without their information. Before that, Kui Mulang had heard a couple of clues from other Great Demons in the Astro Mountains Starry Sea.</p><p>For example, he knew very well that even if he abducted Bai Huaxiu’s reincarnated blue-dressed woman, his efforts would be in vain.</p><p>She would insist on following her path and pray to Immeasurable Heavenly Lord. Hence, she would still be the enemy with the demon races’ faction.</p><p>Unfortunately, things might not necessarily turn out good either, even if she restored the memory of her past life or trusted Kui Mulang’s words. Once she committed apostasy and lost her faith in the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord and Immortal Court, she would perish again as long as Immeasurable Heavenly Lord or other high-level powerhouses in Immortal Court wanted.</p><p>Moreover, this treasured light imbued with faith power invented Immortal Court heretics came deep from the soul. Therefore, to protect Bai Huaxiu’s soul and reincarnate her again, the treasured light imbued with faith power had to follow her to the next reincarnation. Unfortunately, this faith power latched onto the soul and was difficult to dissolve.</p><p>Once you join the heretics, it’s hard to walk out from it.</p><p>Kui Mulang was in a dilemma. It appeared as if not saving her life was a better option.</p><p>However, Kui Mulang didn’t regret his decision but said to Drake-Headed Immortal seriously, “I want to keep her with me.”</p><p>Drake-Headed Immortal looked at Kui Mulang in bafflement, “Is it worth it?”</p><p>“Of course,” replied Kui Mulang.</p><p>Before committing to it, he was still a little hesitant. Now that he acted, he dispelled his hesitation and dedicated himself to his decision to the end.</p><p>Seeing Kui Mulang’s attitude, Drake-Headed Immortal grew vigilant instead.</p><p>He had doubts that if Kui Mulang couldn’t resolve his struggle, he might side with the Immortal Court to stay with Bai Huaxiu.</p><p>Kui Mulang was already at Grand Heavenly Realm. Supposedly, there was no reason for him to bend his knees to Immortal Court.</p><p>However, the Western Pure Lands’ Buddhists were on the perimeter. As a demon races’ Great Sage, he would always be welcomed. Western Pure Lands would naturally be happy to have him, and Immortal Court should be willing to cooperate.</p><p>Drake-Headed Immortal knew that no one had done this in the past, but his intuition strongly warned him that this would be highly possible now.</p><p>It could be devastating to accept such an outcome for Astro Mountains Starry Sea and Blessed Lands of the White Lotus.</p><p>Although Kui Mulang was a newcomer to Grand Heavenly Realm and wasn’t quite experienced, having attained the cultivation realm without a heretic background gave him the quality to not be taken lightly.</p><p>In the present era, only a handful of non-heretics had attained Grand Heavenly Realm organically without relying on heretic means and the Spirit Divinity Overflowing Lid.</p><p>Fortunately, Astro Mountains Starry Sea had ways to keep the Yellow Robe Great Sage Kui Mulang stay on their side.</p><p>“Since she has joined the heretics, it is almost impossible to escape this fate.” Drake-Headed Immortal said slowly, “However, if you want to stay with her forever, there is another way.”</p><p>Kui Mulang said nothing, but he had thought of the way Drake-Headed Immortal hinted.</p><p>That was to have high-level experts of Blessed Lands of the White Lotus meddle into this matter and illuminate Bai Huaxiu forcibly. As a result, she would be converted into a Buddhism heretic, replacing the treasured light imbued with faith power with Buddha light.</p><p>This incident had taken place many times in the course of the warfare between Immortal Court and Blessed Lands of the White Lotus. As a matter of fact, it was quite common.</p><p>However, it was most suitable for people with low cultivation. There were very few similar situations among martial art practitioners who overcame the Immortal Door.</p><p>This was the most secure solution in Kui Mulang and Bai Huaxiu’s current situation.</p><p>Of course, from another perspective, it was fighting fire with fire.</p><p>Anyway, she had entered the heretics. This simply changed her faction, putting her on the same side.</p><p>Kui Mulang also thought of this method, but if there were other hopes, he naturally hoped that Bai Huaxiu could be like him without taking the path of heretics.</p><p>Unfortunately, Drake-Headed Immortal’s answer made him hopeless.</p><p>Drake-Headed Immortal stayed silent and looked at Kui Mulang quietly. Of course, the Immortal knew that he had already thought of this method. Whether he could accept it or not depended on him entirely.</p><p>Though, it was undeniable that Astro Mountains Starry Sea’s attitude toward Kui Mulang depended on this.</p><p>Drake-Headed Immortal closed his eyes, and he said nothing, quietly waiting for Kui Mulang to make his own decision.</p><p>“Let’s do this. We shall look for a Buddha from the central Blessed Lands of Saha to do this.” Kui Mulang thought about it for a while and then made a decision, “For someone at Grand Heavenly Immortal Realm to illuminate someone at Leakless True Immortal, there should be no problem, especially we will be providing aid at the side for this matter.”</p><p>Drake-Headed Immortal opened his eyes and looked at Kui Mulang pleasantly, “The Central Blessed Lands of Saha now has the upper hand. I should be able to coordinate with their manpower. Don’t worry.”</p><p>“That’s good.” Kui Mulang nodded silently.</p><p>He spread out his palm, and a ball of brilliance flashed in his palm. The flashing glow seemed to be an independent world.</p><p>In the world, a woman in blue was sitting cross-legged, with treasured light imbued with faith power rolling on her body. She tried to contact the higher level Immortal Court bigwigs through treasured light imbued with faith power.</p><p>The light was mysterious, and Kui Mulang couldn’t even stop it. He needed to handle it carefully.</p><p>The woman in blue seemed to be quiet now, but in fact, she had protested for a long time before. However, she couldn’t break through the confinement Kui Mulang imposed with her strength. She then gave up her struggling and tried to contact the outside world instead.</p><p>Seeing her falling entirely into the enemy’s grasp and trying to escape his confinement, Kui Mulang sighed.</p><p>Drake-Headed Immortal was still somewhat disapproving of it, but he didn’t comment further.</p><p>While contacting Dao Monarch Lu Ya in the Astro Mountains Starry Sea and other Great Demon powerhouses, he contacted a Blessed Lands of the White Lotus’s Buddhists on the battlefield for help.</p><p>Blessed Lands of the White Lotus also replied quickly.</p><p>Whether to hold Kui Mulang firmly on their side or to acquire another expert who had overcome the Immortal Door, Blessed Lands of the White Lotus was naturally happy to help.</p><p>However, the people who came over made Kui Mulang frown.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, don’t worry. Give me some time, and I will make sure that your wife is well.” The Buddha in front of him sat on the white lotus solemnly.</p><p>However, Kui Mulang didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he glanced at Drake-Headed Immortal.</p><p>“Dingguang Buddha will never disappoint us.” Drake-Headed Immortal reaffirmed.</p><p>The Blessed Lands of the White Lotus Buddha who came here to help the two was Dingguang Joyous Buddha.</p><p>Both Drake-Headed Immortal and Kui Mulang were familiar to them.</p><p>The three of them listened to Prime Clear’s lectures together during ancient times.</p><p>Kui Mulang was not at ease because they knew each other so well.</p><p>Aside from other things, the honorary title “Buddha” was quite distasteful, especially when it involved Bai Huaxiu.</p><p>Find out what happens next by getting early access to chapters with Patreon!
