In fact, she had to hold back her progress most of the time, in case she progressed too quickly.</p><p>When fighting with others, she became even more vicious of a foe. Even in the Grand Virtual or Grand Heavenly Realm, barely anyone could stand up to contend against her.</p><p>She didn’t halt her progress and instead continued pushing forward in this aspect. While this was controversial, she was considered one of the most threatening Grand Heavenly Immortals among the ranks of orthodox Daoism.</p><p>Whenever she made a move, a bigwig expert would often fall to the grace of her saber.</p><p>Some didn’t mind assaulting in a discreet manner. In fact, some would willingly do so. However, this style might not suit the supreme martial arts they cultivated and their strength.</p><p>Some had the capabilities of doing so and were suitable for using such techniques but barred themselves from committing such acts of atrocities.</p><p>As for Feng Yunsheng, she was adept in this regard and didn’t mind doing so.</p><p>This magnified her originally brutal prowess, greatly amplifying the damage she could dish out.</p><p>In the eyes of the Western Pure Lands, the Demon Race, and experts of other factions, Feng Yunsheng was now the most threatening Daoism Grand Heavenly Immortal while without accounting in the Immortal Extermination Formation. Her threat level far surpassed even that of the Incongruence Divine Mother, the Cloudy Firmament Fairy, the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor, and the others.</p><p>Only, whenever Guan Yuluo thought of this, she felt a little sentimental.</p><p>All the while, Feng Yunsheng’s saber intent had always threaded the path of uprightness, conspicuously dominating her foes.</p><p>Her temperament also significantly differed from the Exalted Rahu Luminary – Jian Shunhua.</p><p>Guan Yuluo was worried that these drastic changes would affect Feng Yunsheng’s future and that this way of using the saber would influence Feng Yunsheng’s state of mind.</p><p>“Cease your worries concerning me.” Feng Yunsheng clapped her hand and said with a smile, “While my current path of the saber differs from the past, it is just like how light contrasts dark and how yin and yang coexist. Not only will the transformation not bring harm to my faith toward my martial path, but it might also even bring me improvements.”</p><p>“This was the path that I had prepared long beforehand, so relax.”</p><p>Guan Yuluo nodded ponderously.</p><p>Unlike Guan Yuluo, Meng Wan had already pushed open the Immortal Door and had a much deeper understanding of the dogmas of the world.</p><p>She remained silent as she stared at Feng Yunsheng and merely shook her head discreetly.</p><p>“Just as you said, perhaps you could thread forward in this path, but is this your only choice? Even if you can, it’s still filled with extreme dangers, and it isn’t so smooth-sailing as compared to others. Perhaps, you’ll have an easier time walking other paths?”</p><p>Meng Wan thought, “The brilliance of this era can’t be separated from the boundless darkness…”</p><p>While many thoughts crossed her mind, she didn’t express anything. She merely smiled as she changed the topic, not wanting to discuss this matter any further.</p><p>As they were chatting, Feng Yunsheng’s expression suddenly changed, “ <i>Oh?</i> Zhaoge came out of seclusion.”</p><p>Unlike when Yan Zhaoge attained Five Qis Unifications and ascended to the Grand Virtual Realm, it didn’t cause pandemonium. While Meng Wan and Guan Yuluo could not sense it, they still believed Feng Yunsheng’s judgment.</p><p>They both stood up and smiled as they bid Feng Yunsheng farewell.</p><p>Feng Yunsheng needn’t withhold formalities with them as well. After deciding on the next date to have another meetup, she sent the guests away and headed toward the back of the Broad Creed Mountain.</p><p>When she arrived at the cave manor which Yan Zhaoge secluded in, its large gates opened automatically.</p><p>The cave manor’s design was simple, and only a few mattresses were laid within.</p><p>Upon entering, Feng Yunsheng saw Yan Zhaoge sitting in a lotus position above one of the mattresses. An aureole of splendor shone above his head, forming a brilliant splendor of Soul!</p><p>Five Qis Unification, Three Flowers Converged Crown.</p><p>Now, Yan Zhaoge had finally managed to take a step forward.</p><p>The splendor shining atop his head seemed to contain an endless surge of profundities, which dragged along the entire world in its beckoning. However, it caused no disturbances and wasn’t attention-grabbing, as if it was but a mere illusion.</p><p>As the ethereal and fathomless splendor shone, it scattered about like formless flower petals, which then fluttered toward the outside world.</p><p>They drifted out of the cave manor, out of the Broad Creed Mountain, out of the Sky beyond Skies, and even out of the Zhuluo Royal Reed Heavens until they reached the boundless void.</p><p>“Formless phenomena and inaudible sonorous voice.” Feng Yunsheng praised, “Zhaoge, you’ve truly comprehended the intricacies of the great dao.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge smiled and beckoned for the receding of his splendor back into his Spirit Yin Centre.</p><p>He stood up and left the cave manor while holding Feng Yunsheng’s hand.</p><p>“I tried many new ideas and consumed quite the amount of time. Fortunately, I was rewarded with quite the rewarding returns.” As Yan Zhaoge spoke, he asked, “Is there any news regarding the Soul Dissevering Jade’s whereabouts?”</p><p>The three treasures required to heal Yu Ye – the Sanguinary Stone Marrow, the Soul Dissevering Jade, and the Verve Sea Essence. Among the three, two of those had already been found.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge himself wasn’t in absolute seclusion during these years. After a recurring period, the Broad Creed Mountain would compile information of notable significance and deliver them to his cave manor.</p><p>As such, while Yan Zhaoge had been focusing on his cultivation most of the time, his contact with the outside world had never been cut off.</p><p>Among the three treasures, only no information related to the Soul Dissevering Jade was obtained. Hence, the instant Yan Zhaoge came out of seclusion, he immediately questioned this.</p><p>“Nothing yet as of now. Senior Gao had decided to wait for a while longer. If there’s still no news by that time, then they won’t wait any longer,” answered Feng Yunsheng.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge nodded silently. After a while, he asked, “How about the Earthly Yin Yang Apricot Banner?”</p><p>Among the pile of information delivered to him, matters regarding the Earthly Yin Yang Apricot Banner were also mentioned.</p><p>“Still no concrete clues.” Feng Yunsheng shook her head, “Daoist Yang and Daoist Southern Extremity have been distributing forces to locate it.”</p><p>Yang Jian and the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor were both of the Jade Clear Lineage and had placed the Earthly Yin Yang Apricot Banner as their utmost priority.</p><p>Unfortunately, searching for it was like finding a needle in a haystack. Locating even a single clue related to it posed insurmountable difficulties.</p><p>The conversation between the two wasn’t just limited to the matters of the outside world and discussions of dao itself. Instead, they spoke more of the minor matters Feng Yunsheng had seen and interacted with throughout the period when Yan Zhaoge underwent seclusion.</p><p>As their conversation ended, Yan Zhaoge smiled and said, “The remaining Sea Suppressing Pearls in our hands can finally be utilized now.”</p><p>“ <i>Hmm?</i> You finally thought of a way of using it?” Feng Yunsheng raised her brows.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said, “The preliminary plans have already been made. We shall act in accordance with the situation later on.”</p><p>Then, the two left the Sky beyond Skies and left the Zhuluo Royal Reed Heavens as well.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge reenacted the ritual he used to establish the Zhuluo Royal Reed Heavens and used another Sea Suppressing Pearl to establish yet another cosmos, including it within the ranks of Daoism universes along with the Zhuluo Royal Reed Heavens and the others.</p><p>This commotion was unable to escape the public’s eyes.</p><p>The Daoism experts who presided over the universes of Daoism were the first to notice this.</p><p>Within the distant void, informants of other forces had their attention focused there as well.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge didn’t intend on concealing his actions and merely went ahead with what he was doing.</p><p>Others didn’t interrupt him and silently watched as a new cosmos was being established.</p><p>“Should I assign the task of populating this area to junior apprentice-brother Lan?” asked Feng Yunsheng.</p><p>“Just move mortal citizens from different worlds here.” Yan Zhaoge answered, “As for the other sects, no need to bother. I have some arrangements prepared for this cosmos.”</p><p>Find out what happens next by getting early access to chapters with Patreon! Please do check out the community goal in our Patreon as well!
