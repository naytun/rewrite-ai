Bar any unforeseen circumstances, there would be no external threats to the Eight Extremities World.</p><p>As for internal problems, due to the ‘selfless assistance’ of the Radiant Light Sect and the Grand Xuan Dynasty, Broad Creed Mountain had a grand total of five low-grade Sacred Artifacts which remained in the Eight Extremities World.</p><p>Even without Martial Saint experts, just Martial Grandmasters alone would already be sufficient to handle the overall situation.</p><p>Even if any unexpected situations arose, Yan Zhaoge, Yuan Zhengfeng and the others who guarded the wound of the sky closely would still be able to directly descend and sweep through the enemy.</p><p>Meanwhile, having gained the Life Creation Heavenly Scripture from Yuan Zhengfeng and the Yin Yang Heavenly Scripture from Yan Zhaoge, Broad Creed Mountain’s legacy had inevitably become more superior.</p><p>Many older experts of their sect such as Zhang Kun and He Ning saw a chance of advancing further.</p><p>Perhaps their potential had already slowly run dry as they were destined to be unable to reach the heights of Yan Di, Yuan Zhengfeng and Fang Zhun.</p><p>Still, breaking through that bottleneck that had been plaguing them for so long and surpassing that obstacle as had once felt as difficult as ascending to the heavens, thus progressing greatly, was now possible again, their hopes all rekindled.</p><p>As for Broad Creed Mountain’s senior generation experts and younger generation, they were all in the midst of growing rapidly.</p><p>With their martial legacy and accumulated resources, more outstanding geniuses came to join Broad Creed Mountain, causing its overall advantage in the Eight Extremities World to grow non-stop as its foundation only grew more abundant.</p><p>As time passed, if no major accident happened that switched the heavens and earth, this advantage would only grow to be even more immense.</p><p>Even if the peak experts successively left for the World beyond Worlds, more of the new generation would come to fill the gap.</p><p>This was originally a sect that had started developing normally after achieving absolute hegemony in a lower world.</p><p>Even if they did not intentionally suppress Infinite Boundless Mountain, Jade Sea City and the other powers, the strength of Broad Creed Mountain which had achieved supremacy would still snowball continually.</p><p>As everyone developed normally, Broad Creed Mountain’s advantage would only grow increasingly evident.</p><p>A similar case was the Floating Gate World’s Heavy Sun Sect.</p><p>If not for the circumstance that was Yuan Zhengfeng, be it Great Snowy Mountain or Towering Wave Pavilion, it would have been impossible for either of them to shake the Heavy Sun Sect’s position in the Floating Gate World, even with Great Snowy Mountain’s Bai Ziming already having ascended.</p><p>After Yan Zhaoge, Yan Di and Fang Zhun had stabilised their position in the World beyond Worlds, Yuan Zhengfeng would no longer have to linger in the Eight Extremities World any further.</p><p>When the wound of the sky reopened, Yan Zhaoge’s Northern Ocean Clone suppressed his cultivation base and descended.</p><p>Three days later, the wound of the sky shuddered mightily.</p><p>Aside from the Northern Ocean Clone who returned, there was someone else who came to the World beyond Worlds with the momentum of ripping through the sky.</p><p>That skinny figure seemed to contain boundless power.</p><p>It was precisely Yuan Zhengfeng who no longer had anything holding him back now that everything on hand had been settled!</p><p>“Grand Master!”</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Beneath Broad Creed Mountain’s Water Ridge Peak in the World beyond Worlds, Yan Zhaoge, Fang Zhun, Fu Enshu and the others all smiled.</p><p>Yuan Zhengfeng leapt onto the top of Water Ridge Peak, murmuring to himself as he looked at the unique sky before him, “This is the World beyond Worlds? It is truly remarkable indeed.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge laughed, “Grand Master, this Infinitely Wondrous Life Continuation Pill that my clone mentioned to you down below has already long since been prepared for you.”</p><p>The Infinitely Wondrous Life Continuation Pill was similarly a divine pill that Yan Zhaoge had obtained in his search of the Profound Sky Purple Gold Furnace previously.</p><p>It possessed extremely wondrous effects in the reforging of the fleshly body.</p><p>Even up till today, Yuan Zhengfeng had still yet to reforge his broken arm.</p><p>It was not that he was unable to do so. Instead, he had some unique thoughts about it after cultivating in the Life Creation Heavenly Scripture.</p><p>In order to actualise these thoughts, unique methods were required. He had been gradually preparing for this over the past few years.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge had brought over the Infinitely Wondrous Life Continuation Pill this time in order to make Yuan Zhengfeng’s chances of success a hundred percent.</p><p>Yuan Zhengfeng said warmly, “Thank goodness for you.”</p><p>Fang Zhun said, “Zhaoge has really returned with a big harvest this time. Seeing all those divine pills and efficacious medicines that only exist in legends, it truly is an eye-opening experience indeed.”</p><p>Beside him, Fu Enshu nodded, feeling much the same.</p><p>Having come to the World beyond Worlds, Fu Enshu too had successfully advanced further, stepping into the tenth level of the Martial Saint realm, the Transcending Mortality stage.</p><p>The improvement of their martial legacy, the more abundant cultivation resources and the superior environment of the World beyond Worlds were such that the more outstandingly talented one was, the more they benefited from it.</p><p>Yuan Zhengfeng smiled, “Zhaoge, be it in terms of quality or quantity, your current wealth probably already surpasses even that of Exalts, perhaps?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge chuckled gleefully, “Hard to say, hard to say.”</p><p>Everyone pointed at him, smiling and not speaking.</p><p>Now, spiritual light surged atop Converting Lake Peak by the side.</p><p>Seeing this, Yan Zhaoge and the others exchanged looks, smiling.</p><p>After glancing over, Yuan Zhengfeng realised as well, “It must be Yan Di?”</p><p>The next moment, a figure appeared before their eyes. He looked to be in his thirties or forties from his external appearance with handsome looks and frost on his brows. It was none other than Yan Di.</p><p>He was currently still at the fifth level of the Martial Saint realm, the mid Seeing Divinity stage. Still, from the flickering spiritual light in his eyes, it felt as though he might advance further at any time.</p><p>Seeing Yuan Zhengfeng, Yan Di immediately bowed, “Master, it has been tough on you.”</p><p>Yuan Zhengfeng said, “It hasn’t been long since you ascended. Although the timeflow of the World beyond Worlds is slower than in the Vast Ocean World, it is still faster than in the Eight Extremities World. In all the time that you have spent here, merely half a year has actually passed in the Eight Extremities World.”</p><p>After exchanging their greetings and re-sealing the wound of the sky, they all returned to Heaven Rising Peak to settle down.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge basically recounted all that he had seen and heard over this period of time.</p><p>“To think that Buddhism also exists…” Everyone of Broad Creed Mountain pondered on this, slowly digesting the news that Yan Zhaoge had brought back.</p><p>When everyone else had left and only Yan Zhaoge and Yan Di remained, Yan Zhaoge told his father what he had learnt about Xue Chuqing in close detail.</p><p>Yan Di did not interrupt as he just listened patiently.</p><p>After quietly listening to what Yan Zhaoge had to say, Yan Di said slowly, “This is to say that we  actually should not fully devote ourselves to searching for your mother or it could instead bring her harm? In order to make it easier for her to move, we must even conceal the relationship between us as much as is possible?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge did not mention the matter of the Peerless Heavenly Scripture as he instead said, “I think that investigating in secret is still okay.”</p><p>Yan Di did not respond, just looking slightly out of sorts as he gazed into the distance.</p><p>After a while, he suddenly asked, “The Southeastern Exalt says that one has to reach his level at the very least before being able to know the entirety of the truth?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge answered, “That is indeed what the Southeastern Exalt said.”</p><p>Yan Di nodded thoughtfully before changing the topic, “You feel that Chuqing’s matter is related to that of junior apprentice-niece Sikong and the rest?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
