The one who set it up is considerably skilled in this area.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge understood as he felt the immense pressure brought about by the surrounding Prime Earth Reversal Formation.</p><p>He had encountered an opponent who was considerably proficient in formations this time.</p><p>What was even more crucial was the fact that not only were his attainments in formations high, his cultivation base was very high as well. He should be an early Seeing Divinity Martial Saint at the very least, likely being a mid Seeing Divinity Martial Saint.</p><p>Having an advantage in cultivation base as well as being skilled in formations, the combination of the two was already extremely terrifying.</p><p>It would be fine if he wasn’t given a chance to establish a formation. Now that he had and it was circulating, the Suffering River Region here was equivalent to his home ground where he had the battlefield advantage.</p><p>Here, it would not be a problem for Qi Wei to simultaneously battle against a few experts of the same cultivation level as him at all.</p><p>In order to avoid the Heaven Bearing Ceremony Fragrance, the Prime Chaos Soil and those other treasures being damaged, he was actually holding back in dealing with Yan Zhaoge’s group here.</p><p>Qi Wei definitely wouldn’t pointlessly waste his time waiting for Yan Zhaoge to run out of energy.</p><p>Madame Kang was also present within the formation to incapacitate or slay him.</p><p>Seeing that sword-light that resembled water, Yan Zhaoge could feel the powerful force that was contained within.</p><p>This should be the mid Seeing Divinity Martial Saint who had been searching for him in the region of sea near the Whole Tower Region back then, one of the Shenling Nine Swords.</p><p>Where the sword-light passed, time within the formation seemed almost to fall still.</p><p>Even Yan Zhaoge’s movements slowed as well.</p><p>The Immortal Ending Sword possessed incomparable might, but the difference between their cultivation bases was really a little too great.</p><p>Not executing his sword techniques, Yan Zhaoge could also predict that while the Immortal Ending Sword might be able to cleave through that sword-light that resembled a torrential current for a time, new sword-light would be born in an endless stream, finally overwhelming him like a tsunami.</p><p>Water could extinguish fire, but when fire was too strong, too fierce, the water would be evaporated by the fire instead.</p><p>Moreover, unlike Deng Sen, Cheng Song and the others who had only possessed low-grade Sacred Artifacts, Madame Kang even possessed the likes of the Turbid Heavenly Mirror Armour, a mid-grade Sacred Artifact.</p><p>A Seeing Divinity Martial Saint coupled with the power of a mid-grade Sacred Artifact far surpassed common imagination.</p><p>However, Yan Zhaoge was not flustered as he remained calm and focused.</p><p>He raised his hand and clenched it into a fist, punching out towards that sword-light that resembled the torrential current of time.</p><p>Inestimable sunlight congregated on Yan Zhaoge’s fist, as if this light, this incomparable heat, was the sole reality within this world, the sole focal point.</p><p>The glorious, tyrannical great crimson seal blazed, emitting incandescent golden light as it appeared within the Prime Earth Reversal Formation.</p><p>It was as if the true Sun Star had descended within the formation as for just that one moment, the spirit patterns of the formation all shaking slightly as a result.</p><p>“Having Transcended Mortality and entered Sainthood, it is no longer just once that I can wield the power of the Extreme Yang Seal. I can’t say about more, but three to five times would still be fine.”</p><p>The corners of Yan Zhaoge’s mouth arched slightly as the Extreme Yang Seal shot out towards Madame Kang where his fist-intent targeted.</p><p>Where the sunlight passed, the sword-light that resembled water was instantly thrown into upheaval.</p><p>Everything amidst space regained its vitality, no longer being sluggish or still as time began flowing once more.</p><p>Madame Kang had a shocked expression on her face as Qi Wei too knit his brows tightly upon seeing this, “This is…a high-grade Sacred Artifact?! This kid has actually got a high-grade Sacred Artifact?”</p><p>However, after their shock, their gazes both flickered simultaneously.</p><p>The might of a high-grade Sacred Artifact was such that let alone experts of their level, even King Xuanwen, Shen Lingzi and Daoist Shi of the past had especially yearned for one.</p><p>While they were puzzled as to how Yan Zhaoge was able to wield the power of a high-grade Sacred Artifact whilst only at the first level of the Martial Saint realm, they firmly believed that it definitely</p><p>couldn’t be sustained for long.</p><p>Aside from wresting back the Heaven Bearing Ceremonial Fragrance and those other treasures, Madame Kang and Qi Wei were even more dead set on slaying Yan Zhaoge now.</p><p>Seeing the changes that were out of his predictions, Qi Wei immediately strengthened the power of the Prime Earth Reversal Formation.</p><p>However, even as Yan Zhaoge wielded the Extreme Yang Seal, he was doing other things as well.</p><p>The Northern Ocean Clone did not linger, directly retreating within the Myriad Dragon Palace before a Shadow Shrinking Pouch appeared in his hand.</p><p>The unconcealable fragrance of the Heaven Bearing Ceremonial Fragrance instantly emanated.</p><p>Even as Qi Wei’s and Madame Kang’s spirits rose greatly, they saw the Northern Ocean Clone wielding the Fish Dragon Spear in one hand, stabbing out towards space.</p><p>The tip of the spear landed on a spirit pattern of the Prime Earth Reversal Formation, instantly breaking through space as a terrifying black hole was formed.</p><p>Qi Wei’s brows twitched madly.</p><p>Qi Wei already knew that having been able to break the Heavenly Fire Tribulation Thunder Formation, Yan Zhaoge was considerably skilled in the dao of formations.</p><p>He had already appraised Yan Zhaoge with as high an estimation as possible in this area. Yet, Yan Zhaoge still left him shocked now.</p><p>This stab of the Northern Ocean Clone’s spear precisely struck a key node of the Prime Earth Reversal Formation.</p><p>If Qi Wei did not handle it with care, the formation would immediately grow chaotic as a result.</p><p>He could clearly feel the North Sea Sword Pavilion experts who were currently attacking the Prime Earth Reversal Formation from the outside sensing this as their attacks immediately grew stronger and sharper as well.</p><p>This youth before them was definitely not any inferior to him at all in the area of his attainments in formations, perhaps even surpassing him.</p><p>Qi Wei’s yellowed face twitched slightly, his gaze turning even more icy cold.</p><p>As he controlled the Prime Earth Reversal Formation to obstruct the North Sea Sword Pavilion experts outside, Qi Wei caused variations in the formation to alleviate Yan Zhaoge’s methods.</p><p>However, Yan Zhaoge did not waste time with Qu Wei as the Northern Ocean Clone continuously struck out with his spear, unceasingly damaging the runes of the formation with Qi Wei being forced to exert all means to deal with this.</p><p>Then, the cold, severe light of thunder suddenly appeared in Yan Zhaoge’s right eye!</p><p>A violent thunderbolt that was terrifying to the extreme appeared, resembling divinities bellowing in outrage as numerous runes of the formation were domineeringly shattered!</p><p>It was precisely An Instant’s Thunder!</p><p>Ever since having refined the Eye of the Thunder Emperor fragment many years ago, Yan Zhaoge had become increasingly proficient in unleashing An Instant’s Thunder.</p><p>Not only was this divine thunder unleashed from the fragment of the Eye of the Thunder Emperor, a great amount of Yan Zhaoge’s vigorous true essence had also blazed, going for a full-powered strike.</p><p>Qi Wei was taken unawares by this, nearly letting the Prime Earth Reversal Formation be penetrated straight through by Yan Zhaoge’s An Instant’s Thunder.</p><p>His expression turned slightly livid as he snorted coldly, lowering one hand to forcibly stabilise the grand formation whilst lifting the other high overhead.</p><p>Qi Wei wrote within the air, numerous spirit patterns of light instantly condensing in mid-air as yet another grand formation was clearly in the midst of ceaselessly taking form.</p><p>Various treasures flew out from his accompanying Shadow Shrinking Pouch as the treasures used for the setting up of the second grand formation.</p><p>Madame Kang similarly appeared unfriendly.</p><p>While the Extreme Yang Seal could currently only exert the power of a mid-grade Sacred Artifact, its power was extremely tough and blazing such that she was temporarily unable to break through in a head-on clash.</p><p>Madame Kang stimulated the Turbid Heavenly Mirror Armour to forcibly receive a blow from the Extreme Yang Seal. The sword-light that resembled water finally evaded the Extreme Yang Seal’s obstruction, still descending towards Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>As An Instant’s Thunder shook the Prime Earth Reversal Formation, the Northern Ocean Clone struck out with his spear once more.</p><p>This time, space was ripped completely apart, a massive fissure in space being mightily torn open amidst the formation.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge’s amused laugh trailed lengthily behind him as he kept the Extreme Yang Seal, entering the Myriad Dragon Palace along with the Northern Ocean Clone before they shot within that spatial fissure together.</p><p>Madame Kang’s sword-light was like a vast, mighty river as she directly chased them into the fissure.</p><p>As her sword-light flickered, the chaotic flows of space instantly eased greatly.</p><p>However, Yan Zhaoge waved his hand, that Shadow Shrinking Pouch which contained the Heaven Bearing Ceremonial Fragrance and the other treasures instantly being swept away by the chaotic flows of space, looking like it was about to be lost, drifting unimpeded to locations unknown.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge himself remained leisurely and utterly at ease as he entered another chaotic flow of space.</p><p>Madame Kang hesitated for a moment. Then, she raised her head and sighed helplessly to the heavens before chasing after the Shadow Shrinking Pouch.</p><p>Qi Wei’s second formation enveloped the area, combining with the Prime Earth Reversal Formation as the experts of the North Sea Sword Pavilion were well and properly trapped outside the Suffering River Region. Yet, he could only watch helplessly on now as Yan Zhaoge vanished within that spatial fissure.</p><p>What left him feeling especially despondent was that Yan Zhaoge actually still had the leisure to wave goodbye to him and Madame Kang even as he fled.</p><p>“Whatever the case, the Heaven Bearing Efficate Formation can still be sustained. It is that which is the most important…” Qi Wei could only comfort himself this way now.</p><p>Now, however, the usually composed, elegant Madame Kang emitted a long howl of shock and rage from within that spatial fissure!</p><p>“The Earth Ocean Lung Crystals are missing!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
