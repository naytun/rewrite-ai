Whether it was the true sun in the sky or the radiance of the Extreme Yang Seal down below, they actually all seemed like they were being devoured.</p><p>Rather than day and night interchanging and light turning into darkness, the sunlight itself was being corroded away.</p><p>The sun still existed there, yet seemed unable to emit any light at all.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge’s pupils dilated abruptly, “Power of corrosion?”</p><p>Gazing over carefully, a dim blue black fire seemed to be blazing above the sky, causing the boundaries between the heavens and the earth to grow indistinct, using light as fuel as it soundlessly blazed on.</p><p>Light and darkness coexisted, making up for the lack of the other. Yet, the darkness before them was purely an enemy to the sunlight as it was greedy and tyrannical, unreasonable and a bad portent.</p><p>Light was not justice, and darkness was not evil as well. It could even be safety, for countless lifeforms were nurtured and grew within the darkness.</p><p>However, the black devilish fire that flickered with a dim blue radiance as it devoured the sunlight before them could only foretell infinite terror as well as major calamities.</p><p>“Corrosion in opposition, the heavenly dog eats the sun. This is the opposing star of the Sun Star, Rāhu?” Yan Zhaoge realised, “No wonder they’ve dared to come find trouble this time.”</p><p>After Deng Sen’s group had died, the Radiant Light Sect of the World beyond Worlds would have been hard pressed to imagine that such a powerful opponent existed in the Eight Extremities World.</p><p>From the news they had obtained from Meng Wan and Tang Yonghao, there should not be any such experts in the Eight Extremities World.</p><p>Thus, the Radiant Light Sect had thought that while they didn’t know how Yan Zhaoge and Broad Creed Mountain had been able to unleash the great power of the Extreme Yang Seal, the existence of the Extreme Yang Seal was the sole possibility they could think of that could explain their defeat.</p><p>This had caused them to hunger even more for the Extreme Yang Seal, hating Yan Zhaoge and Broad Creed Mountain even more deeply.</p><p>In order to prevent any unexpected occurrences from taking place, in having dispatched experts into the Eight Extremities World this time, apart from an increased number of experts, the Radiant Light Sect had also specifically prepared something to deal with the Extreme Yang Seal.</p><p>It was this Dim Glorious Devilish Qi that manifested the sun corroding power of the opposing star of the Sun Star, the Rāhu Star!</p><p>Wherever the devilish fire went, it swallowed the sky and devoured the sun.</p><p>That powerful force caused even the radiance of the Extreme Yang Seal to dim.</p><p>At this time, Zhang Chao and the others forcibly resisted Yan Di’s domineering sabre, retreating even more rapidly.</p><p>While they had resisted the might of the Extreme Yang Seal as planned, the people of the Radiant Light Sect were not feeling good at all.</p><p>They had originally wanted to make use of the power of the Rāhu Star to temporarily block the next eruption of power by the Extreme Yang Seal. Afterwards, the six of them would have rampantly swept through Broad Creed Mountain’s experts with the momentum of countless thunderbolts before slowly moving to obtain the Extreme Yang Seal.</p><p>They firmly believed that even if Yan Zhaoge could wield the Extreme Yang Seal, it definitely wouldn’t be for a long period of time.</p><p>As they saw it now, their original plan might indeed have succeeded. Yet, Yan Di had unexpectedly broken through into the second level of the Martial Saint realm, his rampant power being such that he could take on all six of them at once.</p><p>The power which they had originally prepared to deal with the Extreme Yang Seal could only secure their safety as they retreated now.</p><p>The gap between the ideal and actual reality truly caused Zhang Chao and the others to feel stifled. Having expected a glorious victory, they had been sent scurrying back into retreat.</p><p>From above and across the wound of the sky now resounded a voice, “Broad Creed Mountain’s Yan Di. I will remember your name. You are very powerful, powerful beyond our expectations.”</p><p>“You are the strongest person I know who is not from the World beyond Worlds. A pity, however, that being an enemy of our sect, you are doomed to the fate of extinction.”</p><p>Yan Di didn’t even raise his brows, “Sounding so arrogant, come down if you dare.”</p><p>“I can feel that your cultivation base is not higher than the third level of the Martial Saint realm.”</p><p>That voice said mildly, “No rush. We will meet very soon.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge asked, “How do I address you?”</p><p>A gaze seemed to penetrate through the wound of the sky, traversing numerous layers of space as it landed on Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>“Radiant Light Sect’s Nong Yuxuan.”</p><p>“Yan Zhaoge, is it? I don’t know how you are able to wield the Extreme Yang Seal. Still, if you only know how to make use of external objects, your death date is not far away.”</p><p>“I have said that we will be meeting again very soon. Before that, I will be temporarily depositing your head on your neck first.”</p><p>As if supplementing his words, the black devilish fire that flickered with a dim blue light illuminated the surrounding heavens and earth in dimness.</p><p>While the glow of the golden Extreme Yang Seal remained, it was obstructed by the black devilish fire.</p><p>Beneath the terrifying power of the Extreme Yang Seal, the blue black devilish fire was being depleted greatly even as it corroded and devoured the sunlight.</p><p>It was just that before the Extreme Yang Seal extinguished this Rāhu devilish fire, Zhang Chao and the others would probably long since have escaped.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge watched this scene calmly, next suddenly smiling as he looked at that incomparably distant wound of the sky high overhead, “Haven’t you got something wrong?”</p><p>“The Rāhu is the opposing star of the Sun, not its bane star.”</p><p>“Moreover, did you think I wouldn’t have been able to tell? While this Dim Glorious Devilish Qi of yours originates from some supreme treasure that bears the power of the Rāhu Star, you do not actually possess this treasure. Instead, you have merely collected some of its aura and power.”</p><p>“I am unable to wield the full power of the Extreme Yang Seal, but you were never in possession of the supreme Rāhu treasure from the start.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge chuckled, “Acting all almighty like this. Who’re you fooling?”</p><p>As he said thus, Yan Zhaoge flew into the air, pressing onto the Extreme Yang Seal with both hands.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge circulated the Extreme Yang Scripture, the oceanic amount of qi of true dragons secretly accumulated within his body surging into this powerful, bright high-grade Sacred Artifact all at once.</p><p>He currently indeed only had the power for a single strike in wielding the Extreme Yang Seal. Yet, he could strengthen the force of this strike even further!</p><p>Facing the corrosion in opposition power of the Rāhu star which was going against it, the Extreme Yang Seal had originally been restless as its authority seemed to have been provoked.</p><p>Stimulated by Yan Zhaoge’s power now, it instantly grew even more violent.</p><p>The dazzling sunlight illuminated the heavens and earth of the Eight Extremities World once more, even expanding ceaselessly.</p><p>The Dim Glorious Devilish Qi which corroded and devoured the sunlight was cleansed non-stop.</p><p>While sunlight was unceasingly destroyed by the dim blue black fire, the Dim Glorious Devilish Qi was unable to withstand the divine light of the sun that was much, much more powerful than it.</p><p>As this continued, the heavens and earth soon regained their luminosity as the corrosion of the sun instantly ceased.</p><p>Across the wound of the sky, Nong Yuxuan’s voice was filled with bemusement, “Not only is he able to wield the Extreme Yang Seal, the power is actually able to reach such a level?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge chuckled coldly. As wielded by him, the terrifying Extreme Yang Seal broke through the obstruction of the dim blue devilish fire, continuing to strike at the retreating Radiant Light Sect experts!</p><p>Zhang Chao and the other two who had directly ascended were still fine as they successfully broke through the obstruction of the power of dimensions, vanishing from the Eight Extremities World.</p><p>However, the three third level Martial Saints of the Radiant Light Sect who had been in the process of being guided back to the World beyond Worlds through the wound of the sky had the process interrupted and broken off!</p><p>Beneath the might of the Extreme Yang Seal, the trio resisted with all their might, yet felt a terrifyingness like Mount Tai was crushing down upon them.</p><p>Infinite light erupted within the sky!</p><p>From the other side, Yan Di’s sabre did not halt in the least as his domineering sabre-light cleaved the heavens and decimated the earth, hacking over once more!</p><p>Three tragic cries simultaneously resounded as the Extreme Yang Seal mightily pressured downwards, the heavens and the earth shaking intensely!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
