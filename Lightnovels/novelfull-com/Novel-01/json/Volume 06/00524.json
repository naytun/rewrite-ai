The Rainbow Jade Pith was indeed of assistance to Sister-in-law Yuzhen,” Xu Fei retracted his smile, saying solemnly, “Her situation now is much better than it was back then. However, Sister-in-law Yuzhen has still yet to awaken.”</p><p>Seeing Xu Fei’s comparatively relaxed expression, Yan Zhaoge and Fu Enshu were able to set their minds at ease.</p><p>“I was pleasantly surprised to discover a spirit spring on this Directionless Island that is similarly of assistance to Sister-in-law Yuzhen. Still, the spring water already almost dried up a few decades ago, only a small amount of spring water currently still being produced.”</p><p>As he walked, Xu Fei said, “I have currently placed the ice coffin containing Sister-in-law Yuzhen’s body directly before the source of the spring, just that I do not know how much longer this must go on for.”</p><p>“I have these friends of Changli Mountain to thank for allowing us to borrow this spirit spring.”</p><p>Bai Jingkang and the others hurriedly said that it was fine while Yan Zhaoge and Fu Enshu expressed their gratitude once more.</p><p>They met the Chief of Changli Mountain, who was very thoughtful as he did not keep Yan Zhaoge and Fu Enshu there for long, allowing them to go straight to the spirit spring in the back mountains and check on Ying Yuzhen’s condition.</p><p>After analysing the spring water for a while, Yan Zhaoge nodded slightly, “Ocean Scorching Spring-to think that this could be found in the Vast Ocean World. It is indeed of use to Sister-in-law Yuzhen. Sadly, the spring water has almost dried up, with us only able to rely on what little is slowly produced from it over time.”</p><p>He sighed, “This will probably take quite a long period of time. The Ocean Scorching Spring is not something that can be moved. The living, flowing spring water is required for it to be effective.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge looked rather worriedly at Xu Fei, “I had originally intended to bring you guys back to the Eight Extremities World this time.</p><p>Xu Fei shook his head, smiling, “It’s fine. I and Jun’er can just continue staying here. There is no need to worry about us.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said, “Seeing the two of you safe and well, we can finally set our minds at ease a little.”</p><p>Xu Fei asked, “How is the situation over at the Eight Extremities World?”</p><p>Hearing him mention this, Yan Zhaoge and Fu Enshu exchanged glances as their expressions both became rather gloomy.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge succinctly explained the crux of the situation to Xu Fei.</p><p>There were various kinds of news both good and bad. The repelling of the Nine Underworlds over at the Earth Domain, the sealing of the Flame Devils over the East Sea, with them unable to create havoc again within a long upcoming period of time, Yan Di Transcending Mortality and entering Sainthood, presiding arrogantly over the entire Eight Extremities World-all of these raised Xu Fei’s spirits greatly, his blood boiling heatedly with passion.</p><p>Yuan Zhengfeng’s disappearance, Fang Zhun’s grave injuries, the uncertain situation of Feng Yunsheng and Yin Liuhua with their safety at risk-all of these things left Xu Fei frowning worriedly.</p><p>“The problem for Grand Master is mainly that he fell within chaotic space, having gone to some unknown destination which makes finding him very difficult,” Yan Zhaoge said softly, “However, there is no need to worry too much about his safety. While he is missing an arm, he is still a Martial Saint, also being greatly experienced. He should be able to stay clear of harm despite his situation.”</p><p>“Second apprentice-uncle just needs to recuperate in peace. Having treated him before I left, I know for certain that he is no longer in danger of dying.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge rubbed his temple, “Instead, it is junior apprentice-sister Feng’s lot whose situations are still unknown, perhaps having met with great danger. Even if no one from the Sacred Sun Clan acted against them, if they were swept within the scope of influence of the seal’s power, it would still have been a sure-death situation for them.”</p><p>After a long time, Xu Fei exhaled slowly, “Hopefully, they have been fortunate in the face of danger.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge fell into a deep silence.</p><p>A rare feeling of anxiety surged within his heart, requiring him to unceasingly control and remind himself that he had to remain calm and rational.</p><p>Looking at Yan Zhaoge, Fu Enshu seemed to feel something. Still, she did not say anything, just giving an ambiguous sigh whose meaning was hard to discern.</p><p>Xu Fei changed the topic, asking, “With Grand Master missing, our Chief sealing the Flame Devils over the East Sea and senior apprentice-uncle Fang heavily injured and in a coma, is it our two Grand Elders who are overseeing things back in the clan?”</p><p>Stabilising his mind, Yan Zhaoge said, “Elder Zhang was sitting over the clan. After second apprentice-uncle was sent back to the Mountain, he should have been helping to take care of him, assisting in treating his injuries.”</p><p>“Elder He headed to the East Sea along with my father…”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge swivelled his head to look at Fu Enshu, who said, “Senior apprentice-aunt He battled against numerous Great Flame Devils alone, with one of them being an existence infinitesimally close to a Flame Devil King as it was not any weaker than our human race’s Transcending Mortality Martial Grandmasters. In having slain it, senior apprentice-aunt He was herself injured as well. Still, it was not a life-threatening injury.”</p><p>“It is likely that our two Grand Elders are currently overseeing the general situation over at our clan, with senior apprentice-brother Chang helping to manage its daily affairs.”</p><p>The senior apprentice-brother Chang that Fu Enshu spoke of referred to the East Sea First Seat Elder before her, Chang Zheng.</p><p>During the great tribulation of Broad Creed Mountain, with Shi Tie of the Disciplinary Hall having perished, it was Chang Zheng who had returned from the East Sea and assumed his role. He was a disciple of the Grand Elder Zhang Kun and a late Essence Talisman Martial Grandmaster at the ninth level of the Martial Grandmaster realm.</p><p>As compared to Shi Tie, Fang Zhun, Fu Enshu and the others, Yan Zhaoge was much more unfamiliar with Chang Zheng who had been stationed outside of Broad Creed Mountain for a long time. After Chang Zheng had returned to the Mountain, it had been Yan Zhaoge who had often been out on his travels, the two not really having directly interacted as a result.</p><p>Still, just from what he knew, this senior apprentice-uncle Zhang was one of the peak figures of Broad Creed Mountain’s senior generation, having stepped into the late Essence Talisman Martial Grandmaster realm even earlier than Fu Enshu. Amongst those of the same generation, there had only been the Broad Creed Three Heroes who had been stronger than him.</p><p>Having once been the West Elder and the East Sea First Seat Elder, he was currently the First Seat Elder of the Disciplinary Hall.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge asked, “I remember that senior apprentice-uncle Chang went to the East Sea as well?”</p><p>Fu Enshu nodded, “That’s right. Still, senior apprentice-brother Chang was not injured. He should be fine.”</p><p>Xu Fei said, “Having faced a simultaneous invasion by the Flame Devils and the Nine Underworlds this time, our clan lost quite a bit. Still, as long as we manage to get through this, we will then be able to enjoy the fruits of our labour. Other things aside, when the seal over the East Sea has been completely accomplished and our Chief gets to leave, there will be no one who can stop him.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge nodded, “Bar any major incidents.”</p><p>He sighed softly, “Anyway, we just have to get back as quickly as possible.”</p><p>Fu Enshu said, “That’s right. You having refined a Martial Saint clone now, having returned to the Eight Extremities World, it will be a major force that cannot be overlooked. Especially with junior apprentice-brother Yan, Old Man Mo, East Rising Huang and Song Wuliang currently unable to leave the East Sea, there would be a great effect with our clan possessing an additional Martial Saint.”</p><p>“With both you and the Clear Qi Robe, it will be sufficient in tiding things out and awaiting junior apprentice-brother Yan being able to extricate himself from the East Sea.”</p><p>Xu Fei smiled, “If junior apprentice-sister Feng has been favoured by fortune, our clan will likely win the Extreme Yin Crown as well.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge nodded quietly, “Let us hope that they are safe.”</p><p>Over the upcoming days, Yan Zhaoge and Fu Enshu remained on Directionless Island, the latter recuperating from her injuries while the former cultivated in the martial dao whilst also waiting patiently for the Lofty Prestige Mirror to regain its function.</p><p>At the same time, he was also waiting for Shi Jun to return to Changli Mountain, very much wanting to see how he was now that he was all grown up.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Shi Jun did not return. Instead, what came was a piece of information that was related to him.</p><p>“What did you say?” Yan Zhaoge and Xu Fei both looked astonishedly at Bai Jingkang of Changli Mountain, “Little Jun’er kidnapped someone’s daughter and ran off, their locations currently unknown?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
