If there is a need to in the future, I might have to bother your sect then.”</p><p>Fang Zhaohong said, “We welcome you at any time.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge looked at the stone statue beside him, smiling, “To be honest, I have only found this thing within this foreign dimension. I am ashamed to say that I have still yet to understand it completely.”</p><p>“It should be a good thing, but it is clearly unable to be split. What does your sect say to this?”</p><p>Fang Zhaohong raised his hand, making a ‘please’ gesture as he slowly said, “If it were someone else, our sect would still have to compete for it a bit. Ownerless treasures belong to the able, having nothing to do with the order in which one arrives.”</p><p>“However, you saved so many of us from the people of the Evil Shifting Sect just now, and we are truly grateful for that. Since you arrived first, being the first to discover this treasure, we will naturally not compete with you over it.”</p><p>While saying so, he stepped back, indicating that he would not get into a conflict with Yan Zhaoge over this treasure. Yang Chufan and the other Spirit Rhino Island martial practitioners who had followed him in stepped back as well.</p><p>From the looks of it, they seemed about to leave the foreign dimension.</p><p>Fang Zhaohong said, “We will wait for you outside. If you want to travel to the Directionless Sea where Changli Mountain is, the closest route lies through our sect’s Spirit Rhino Sea. We could travel together as a group.”</p><p>“Being so young yet already possessing such a shocking cultivation base, we hope that you can give a few more pointers to the youngsters of our Spirit Rhino Island.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge smiled, “You are polite.”</p><p>Seeing Fang Zhaohong and the others disappear before him, Yan Zhaoge did not continue connecting with the stone statue. Instead, he grabbed it with force, instead to first keep this mysterious treasure and leave the rest for after he had left this place.</p><p>His true essence enveloping the stone statue, the stone statue seemed fixed to the ground, only shaking a little as Yan Zhaoge was unable to shift it at all with his first attempt.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge’s current cultivation base was such that he would be able to uproot even a mountain.</p><p>However, shifting the stone statue now, he had the feeling of trying to shake this entire foreign dimension.</p><p>This feeling was even heavier than when he had moved the true dragon’s corpse at the old residence of the Glacial Dragon Martial Saint back then.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge’s expression did not change as he exerted additional force, with streams of clear qi simultaneously emitted from his body and infused within the acupoints of that stone statue.</p><p>The entire foreign dimension was shaking slightly, but that heavy stone statue finally left the ground.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge opened his Shadow Shrinking Pouch, wanting to keep it within. However, it felt extremely difficult.</p><p>Doing the same as before, the pillar of the Divine Palace served its use and suppressed the stone statue, causing it to instead feel much lighter.</p><p>Now, light suddenly flickered above Yan Zhaoge’s head!</p><p>Streams of light intermingled within the air, seemingly forming a circular mirror. A figure surfaced within the light of the mirror. Shockingly, it was precisely Fang Zhaohong who had just left!</p><p>Fang Zhaohong appeared just mere inches away from Yan Zhaoge, next striking out simultaneously with his palms towards him!</p><p>Spirit Rhino Island supreme martial art, Spiritual Light Flashes!</p><p>Borrowing his true martial intent that he had left behind in secret, Fang Zhaohong’s sudden assault was virtually like instant teleportation as most would be hard pressed to defend against it.</p><p>Having left and then returned, he brought down his palms together, jade light flickering as an enormous true martial talisman appeared, profound and mysterious.</p><p>However, the world between him and Yan Zhaoge was suddenly separated by darkness.</p><p>At this moment, a distance of just mere inches away felt as great as that between the heavens and the earth.</p><p>Fang Zhaohong’s heart sunk. He changed his palm-technique, streams of jade light circulating as they proceeded forth amidst the darkness.</p><p>However, the boom of thunder suddenly resounded within the boundless darkness. The next moment, the space was filled with strange white thunder light that shot over towards Fang Zhaohong like the tides of a sea!</p><p>Fang Zhaohong was shocked somewhat. He hurriedly retracted his palms and retracted, his entire person seemingly transforming into a jade light which shifted about and zigzagged within the air.</p><p>Enveloped by the Thunder of Eternal Night, Yan Zhaoge’s figure was indistinctly visible, “Oh, Spirit Rhino Island’s martial arts also have some unique areas of their own.”</p><p>Fang Zhaohong knit his brows, striking out towards Yan Zhaoge with a palm while his other palm waved within the air.</p><p>Mirror-light flickered within the air. It was a high-grade spirit artifact!</p><p>Radiance surged as Fang Zhaohong’s figure flashed, coming before Yan Zhaoge once more.</p><p>One hand on the shoulder of the stone statue, Yan Zhaoge flickered his other sleeve, the roar of a dragon resounding as green light flickered within that sleeve.</p><p>The high-grade spirit artifact, the Green Abyss Sword, transformed into a green dragon under Yan Zhaoge’s will, viciously shooting towards Fang Zhaohong’s mirror-light!</p><p>“An Essence Spirit Martial Grandmaster who possesses a high-grade spirit artifact?” Fang Zhaohong’s heart sunk once more, his mind falling completely calm as he unleashed Spirit Rhino Island’s supreme martial art, the Spirit Rhino Palm, to its maximum level.</p><p>Executed by Fang Zhaohong, this martial art was worlds away from when it had been executed by Yang Chufan.</p><p>Fang Zhaohong’s eyes shone with jade light, resembling two round mirrors. On the mirrors were reflected the possible variations that might follow with Yan Zhaoge’s sword.</p><p>His true martial talisman circulating, streams of profound aura connected with the surrounding area.</p><p>Fang Zhaohong transformed into a streak of jade light, avoiding Yan Zhaoge’s sword.</p><p>Jade light flickered continuously as he calculated the variations in Yan Zhaoge’s sword arts whilst attempting to find a weakness within through which to counterattack.</p><p>Seeing this, Yan Zhaoge laughed lightly, “Spirit Rhino achieving Consonance, countering the enemy and seizing the initiative?”</p><p>His sword arts did not change as his gaze suddenly turned deep as an abyss and a sea.</p><p>Fang Zhaohong’s mind wavered slightly. Before his eyes seemed to appear a gigantic spirit turtle, unmoving and unshaking as it remained concealed within the depths of the sea.</p><p>The sea’s surface seemed completely without winds or waves, all silent as no ripples appeared on it at all.</p><p>His high-grade spirit artifact, the Jade Light Mirror, achieved perfect harmony with Spirit Rhino Island’s Spirit Rhino Palm, predicting an enemy’s moves and countering them to obtain victory.</p><p>However, at this moment, with his mind completely blank, there was no way at all for him to project Yan Zhaoge’s upcoming moves and variations.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge executed Coiling Dragon Sleeve techniques whilst also the mental arts of the Ocean Stabilising Spirit Fist of the Six Spirit Demonic Fists, instantly denying Fang Zhaohong’s methods.</p><p>“I don’t know why you decided to make a move on me…” Yan Zhaoge said mildly, “However, I don’t actually care about the reason. Also, don’t you say to me anything like it was a misunderstanding.”</p><p>Before his voice had fallen, Yan Zhaoge’s sword-technique had changed once more.</p><p>As the green dragon flew, it suddenly opened its mouth and roared. The galaxy instantly tilted as specks of starlight filled the surrounding space, enveloping Fang Zhaohong.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge was currently not using the Ocean Stabilising Spirit Fist anymore. Spiritual light flashing within his mind, Fang Zhaohong could project the variations in his sword once more.</p><p>However, as Yan Zhaoge’s sword shot over now, it contained myriad variations as there seemed to be innumerable potential possibilities. Fang Zhaohong was left completely unable to complete his projections.</p><p>Instantly, Fang Zhaohong had been struck by several swords.</p><p>His injuries could not be considered serious. As compared to the wounds on his body, what caused Fang Zhaohong more discomfort was the feeling of countless things having been forcibly stuffed within his brain that seemed like it was going to explode.</p><p>That discomforting feeling pressured Fang Zhaohong towards wishing to terminate his usage of the Spirit Rhino Palm.</p><p>“Aren’t you very proficient in projecting? You’re unable to hold on just like this?” Yan Zhaoge smiled, already having completely kept the stone statue.</p><p>Without the stone statue holding him back, Yan Zhaoge’s power erupted mightily, no longer using any subtle combat methods as he instead focused his power directly for a mighty, head-on clash!</p><p>“You cannot keep up with the complicated stuff. Let us make it a little simpler then.”</p><p>Saying thus, Yan Zhaoge’s sword rampaged through the air, shooting towards Fang Zhaohong with the momentum of splitting the heavens!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
