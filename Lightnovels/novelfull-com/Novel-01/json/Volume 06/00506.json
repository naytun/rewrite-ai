On the contrary, Shi Tie was one of the people she had been closest to in the clan.</p><p>Fu Enshu was both respectful and afraid of this eldest apprentice-brother.</p><p>When Shi Tie had perished for the clan in the great tribulation of Broad Creed Mountain, Fu Enshu had felt greatly pained as well.</p><p>Fu Enshu had always been felt troubled over Xu Fei as well as Shi Jun and his mother who had headed off into the Vast Ocean World earlier.</p><p>Having learnt that she and Yan Zhaoge were currently in the Vast Ocean World, Fu Enshu was naturally very concerned about their situation.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said, “You can rest easy, senior apprentice-aunt. These past days, I’ve interacted quite a bit with Vast Ocean World’s martial practitioners and understood more of the situation here.”</p><p>“Changli Mountain does not stand at the top of the Seven Pillars of Good, but it is still not an existence to be taken lightly. It strength is not inferior to Spirit Rhino Island or the Evil Shifting Sect.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said slowly, “Amongst the Seven Pillars of Good, it is Water Crystal Palace that is the strongest. However, the Blood Dragon Sect and the Myriad Sword Pool both have the qualifications to contend with it as well. These three sects stand at the top of the Seven Pillars of Good.”</p><p>“Due to not having any Martial Saints or Sacred Artifacts, the other four sects are comparatively weaker. However, they have substantial strength as well as background as well.”</p><p>Hearing his words, Fu Enshu nodded, “It is pretty much the same as in our Eight Extremities World.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge continued, “Those three strongest sects, whilst standing against one another, also attempt to draw the other four of Changli Mountain, Spirit Rhino Island, the Spirit Returning Sect as well as the Blazing Wind Sect to their sides as well. While these other four sects remain independent and autonomous, they more or less still individually each lean towards one of these powers as well.”</p><p>“Amongst them, Spirit Rhino Island leans towards Myriad Sword Pool, the Blazing Wind Sect leans towards the Blood Dragon Sect while Changli Mountain and the Spirit Returning Sect both lean towards Water Crystal Palace a little.”</p><p>“The loose alliance formed by these three sects is the strongest. While the other two sides guard against each other, there is also vaguely the momentum of teaming up to stand three against four. Like this, none of them is able to do anything to another.”</p><p>Having said that, Yan Zhaoge spread his hands apart, “Externally, there are still the Six Evil Sects. Therefore, nothing too great usually happens amongst these Seven Pillars of Good. Of course, the Six Evil Sects are also not harmonious internally. Instead, their underlying tensions might be even more intense.”</p><p>“I heard earlier that senior apprentice-brother Xu and Little Shi Jun are currently doing rather well in Changli Mountain. When interacting with those of Spirit Rhino Island earlier, I only said that I was going to Changli Mountain. They should not suspect anything about senior apprentice-brother Xu and Shi Jun.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge paused for a moment before continuing, “Still, comparing the martial arts that we use, the other side may be able to see some similarities.”</p><p>Fu Enshu said, “If it is the Clear Qi Profound Art, unless it leaves behind visible marks on someone else’s body, it would not be so easy to compare.”</p><p>“Other than our clan’s foundational martial arts, of those more profound ones, you do not know the Great Heaven Earth Sword and Xu Fei and Shi Jun also do not know the others that you cultivate in. The only similar one is the Big Dipper Sword.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge recalled for a moment before smiling, “What a coincidence. I used the Big Dipper Sword once, and no one was left alive at the scene.”</p><p>Fu Enshu waved her hands, “It is fine then.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said, “Spirit Rhino Island cannot decide anything about Changli Mountain. However, that Yang Chufan and the others seemed to have taken me for someone of the Sacred Evil Sect, also sounding like they had good reason to believe it to be true. I wonder where they got that from.”</p><p>“The Sacred Evil Sect is one of the Six Evil Sects. Saying that this is related to the battle between good and evil, Spirit Rhino Island and Myriad Sword Pool would be able to cook up some justification.”</p><p>Fu Enshu gazed towards the faraway sea, “No matter what, let’s hurry to Changli Mountain first. You heard just now that the fastest way to Changli Mountain is across the territory of Spirit Rhino Island?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge nodded, “That’s right. The Directionless Sea that Changli Mountain is in is separated from this Bewildering Maze Sea by the Spirit Rhino Sea. If we did not go to the Spirit Rhino Sea, we would have to take a longer route in travelling via the Flying Turtle Sea.”</p><p>Fu Enshu’s brows were knit tight, “You said just now that the Chief of Spirit Rhino Island is a Transcending Mortality Martial Grandmaster? If that is so, it would really be hard. The person you killed being his son, he will definitely want to kill you. Now, the entire Spirit Rhino Sea is probably already standing at full guard, being full of Spirit Rhino Island martial practitioners.”</p><p>While she was rather headstrong, Fu Enshu could discern the situation as well as the difference in strength between them and the enemy.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge smiled, “In truth, I heard that Spirit Rhino Island has two Transcending Mortality Martial Grandmasters. The Chief Fang Kan is ranked seventh amongst the ten strongest Transcending Mortality Martial Grandmasters of this Vast Ocean World.”</p><p>Hearing his words, Fu Enshu knit her brows even more tightly.</p><p>However, carefully observing Yan Zhaoge’s expression, her heart suddenly jolted, “I only broke through to become a late Essence Talisman Martial Grandmaster not long ago. Within a short period of time, it would be impossible for me to break through into the Transcending Mortality stage. Moreover, I have still yet to make a complete recovery from my injuries, my strength being affected as a result. If you have a method, just say it.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge spread his palms apart, smiling as he said, “To tell you the truth, I currently don’t have too great a plan. However, there might just be one in a couple of days.”</p><p>Fu Enshu asked curiously, “You want to break through into the Essence Talisman Martial Grandmaster realm? I know that you are a heaven-defying genius like Yan Di, possessing incredible power at the same cultivation level. Even at these heights, the power you possess still far surpasses that of others. However, would you be able to resist a Transcending Mortality Martial Grandmaster as an early Essence Talisman Martial Grandmaster?”</p><p>“Or is it to say that you can make a number of consecutive breakthroughs within a short period of time?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge chortled, “Speaking of this, I really have the people of Spirit Rhino Island to thank. I found a good thing in this Bewildering Maze Sea.”</p><p>“However, in order for it to be able to be used, I still have to go to a particular place and make some preparations.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge pointed into the distance, “We are currently headed right in the direction of that place. Rather than going directly to Changli Mountain, we will have to take a little bit of a side trip. However, sharpening your blade does not hinder one in chopping firewood. Moving a little off-tangent now, the way for us later on will be straight and clear.”</p><p>Fu Enshu’s gaze flickered, “Oh? What place?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge answered, “The area where the Spirit Rhino Sea, the Flying Turtle Sea and the Bewildering Maze Sea intersect. It is known as the Deep Sea Corridor.”</p><p>“I asked around from some Vast Ocean World martial practitioners on this Bewildering Maze Sea. There is something that I want there, which can be considered an unexpected surprise.”</p><p>Fu Enshu said, “Let’s get to it then. Let’s make haste.”</p><p>The two were currently already rather close to the Deep Sea Corridor. As they rapidly progressed, calculating the distance, Yan Zhaoge felt that it should be nearby.</p><p>“Let’s go,” Saying thus, Yan Zhaoge dived into the sea.</p><p>Fu Enshu naturally followed Yan Zhaoge’s lead.</p><p>Diving downwards, they could soon vaguely see an oceanic trench right at the bottom of the sea.</p><p>There, turbid flows of water converged from three different directions.</p><p>“Huh?” Yan Zhaoge and Fu Enshu exchanged glances as they discovered that other than the two of them, there were currently many other martial practitioners congregated here as well.</p><p>Amongst them were some Spirit Rhino Island martial practitioners. Their cultivation bases were not very high, such that it would be impossible for them to surround and capture Yan Zhaoge on their own.</p><p>Other than Spirit Rhino Island martial practitioners, there were also people of other sects.</p><p>Having congregated at this place, they seemed all to have gathered here for some important matter.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
