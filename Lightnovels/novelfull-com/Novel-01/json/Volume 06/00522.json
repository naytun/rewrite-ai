Upon reaching the mid Essence Spirit Martial Grandmaster realm, I gained ten spiritual leaves, the rune inscribed on that tenth leaf being rather unique.”</p><p>“That was something I comprehended and gained regarding the principles of the heavens and the earth during my cultivation, being extremely abstruse and hard to explain. Still, I think that it must have been some hidden, profound properties of this that helped me to achieve this feat today.”</p><p>Recalling this, Fu Enshu nodded slowly, “It was indeed profound. While the ten leaves blossoming ten flowers of your father’s that I saw that year was also profound and indiscernible, it still seems to have been less abstruse than yours.”</p><p>She sighed in praise, “Spirit leaves and spirit flowers, whilst being everyone’s fortune, is also the manifestation of one’s comprehensions and accumulated foundation in the martial dao. Being in possession of this fortune, it is also inextricably linked to the foundation that you’ve established.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge chortled, “I think so as well.”</p><p>Despite his shameless look, Fu Enshu was not annoyed, “Right. While I have not supervised your cultivation before, I know of how diligently you usually cultivate.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge asked, “How are your injuries, senior apprentice-aunt?”</p><p>“Having battled with someone just now, yet some more time will be required before I can fully recover,” Fu Enshu said, “Rather than that, are we headed to Changli Mountain now?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge nodded, “That’s right. Directly crossing the Spirit Rhino Sea and arriving at the Directionless Sea, no further obstacles would lie before us.”</p><p>While Fang Kan was already dead, even if he had still been alive, he would still have been powerless to prevent Yan Zhaoge from crossing the Spirit Rhino Sea with his Northern Ocean Clone.</p><p>“Changli Mountain should already have received news of the incident over at the Deep Sea Corridor and the Bewildering Maze Sea. If Bai Jingkang and his wife are still there, hearing other people’s description of me, they should be able to guess my identity.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge stroked his lower chin, saying, “Still, from the looks of it, the higher echelons of Changli Mountain will likely be keeping this matter a secret. Senior apprentice-brother Xu is a guest Elder there, having been living there together with Little Jun’er all these years. There have not been too many rumours regarding them in the Vast Ocean World, everyone just having taken them as former solitary practitioners.”</p><p>Fu Enshu appeared slightly unfocused, “From what you say, they have already been in the Vast Ocean World for around seven to eight years. I wonder how Yuzhen is doing?”</p><p>Hearing her words, Yan Zhaoge was rather troubled as well, “Sadly, there is no way for us to know about this now. We will only be able to know after we’ve arrived at Changli Mountain.”</p><p>He said, “We should hurry towards Changli Mountain as soon as possible. You can recuperate in peace along the way, senior apprentice-aunt.”</p><p>Fu Enshu nodded, sitting in the meditative position in mid-air as she closed her eyes.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge’s Northern Ocean Clone transformed into a great roc, its claws respectively grabbing Yan Zhaoge and Fu Enshu before it expanded its wings, flying with the wind at an extremely swift speed.</p><p>Seated there, Fu Enshu did not suffer any turbulence at all.</p><p>Looking up at his Northern Ocean Clone, Yan Zhaoge nodded slightly, “The Northern Ocean Martial Saint Zhuang Kun indeed had a rather shocking level of attainment. It was a pity that he perished along the way; otherwise, he might just have been able to ascend to the World beyond Worlds.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge inwardly praised Zhuang Kun’s martial dao that had unique areas of its own.</p><p>Having become the Northern Ocean Clone now, his mortal shell could still cultivate and rise in strength.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge pondered on what supreme martial arts he should equip his clone with such that it would rise in strength even more quickly.</p><p>Already having the body of a Martial Saint and possessing an extremely solid foundation from what Zhuang Kun had once cultivated in, it would instead not be ideal for the clone to switch to cultivating in things like the Peerless Heavenly Scripture.</p><p>The result of forcibly changing this could instead interfere irreparably with its strength.</p><p>“It is not like there is no way. It just has to be done slowly and over time, the effects slowly playing out,” As Yan Zhaoge pondered, his essence talisman appeared over his head, shining bright with light.</p><p>To Yan Zhaoge, stepping into the Essence Talisman Martial Grandmaster realm was also significant in another way.</p><p>Strange, graceful characters now flickered within his eyes.</p><p>He raised his palm above his head before flipping it over, bringing it downwards.</p><p>His movements were great and exaggerated, simple yet heavy.</p><p>At this moment, Yan Zhaoge’s entire aura was different as he resembled a descended divinity.</p><p>Accompanied by the flipping of his palm, the heavens and the earth seemed to be reversing, the sky plummeting downwards as it seemed to have toppled with just that single palm.</p><p>It was precisely the Heavenly Broad Creed Palm of Broad Creed Mountain’s Three Supreme Arts.</p><p>Still, the Heavenly Broad Creed Palm that Yan Zhaoge was currently executing seemed somewhat different from before.</p><p>Meanwhile, above Yan Zhaoge’s head, apart from the essence talisman with the Peerless Heavenly Scripture as its base, another essence talisman was shockingly gradually taking form.</p><p>Accompanied by the manifestation of this talisman, the momentum of Yan Zhaoge’s Heavenly Broad Creed Palm rapidly increased as it actually seemed truly able to flip the heavens and overturn the earth!</p><p>It was not just the heavens and the earth. All the laws and principles of this world seemed to circulate in reverse alongside this as well.</p><p>Yin and yang, light and darkness, hot and cold, fast and slow, passive and active-all of these showed signs of being overturned.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge smiled.</p><p>Broad Creed Mountain’s supreme martial art, the Heavenly Broad Creed Palm, had been obtained by their founder, the Heaven Establishing Old Man Qiu Yuan, from analysing the remnant legacies of the pre-Great Calamity Clear Jade lineage and developing it to how it was now.</p><p>Meanwhile, he had analysed this from the Cyclic Heavenly Scripture of its direct lineage, a Heavenly Scripture that was on the same level as the Life Creation Heavenly Scripture and the Peerless Heavenly Scripture!</p><p>Originating from the direct lineage of the Clear Jade lineage, the Cyclic Heavenly Scripture entailed toppling the heavens and overturning the earth.</p><p>Its essence and profundities were not simply about toppling the heavens and overturning the earth as it instead concerned two extremes circulating in reverse.</p><p>The principles that it analysed was that primary quality that caused even the heavens and the earth to be reversed as could also be displayed in the reversal of yin and yang, activity and passivity, heat and coldness and so on and so forth.</p><p>What appeared to be two different extremes were instead closely linked, the techniques grasped within allowing one to reverse the heavens and the earth with just a little bit of strength, thereby forming an incomparably great power.</p><p>This was the true meaning of the Cyclic Heavenly Scripture, through which one could obtain a supreme martial art, the Cyclic Heavenly Seal, presiding loftily over all living lifeforms with one’s name famed throughout ten thousand lifetimes.</p><p>In the past, there had existed the ancestor of the Clear Jade lineage, the Lord of Primordial Beginning. His disciple, the Lord of Broad Completion, had perfected this martial art, also possessing a supreme treasure of the same name. In that legendary era, countless powerful experts had perished to the Cyclic Heavenly Seal.</p><p>The current Heavenly Broad Creed Palm of Broad Creed Mountain was actually an incomplete variant of the Cyclic Heavenly Seal.</p><p>When choosing one of the Three Supreme Arts that year, Yan Zhaoge had not chosen the Limitless Heavenly Sword despite his proficiency in the sword, also not having chosen the Immeasurable Heavenly Scripture that his father cultivated in. Instead, he had chosen the Heavenly Broad Creed Palm. In doing so, it had actually been in preparation for this day.</p><p>Even though he had not cultivated in the Cyclic Heavenly Scripture, due to his knowledge of it, Yan Zhaoge had been able to accomplish the Heavenly Broad Creed Palm with much greater ease back then, far surpassing others in terms of his speed of cultivating in it as well as his comprehension and execution of it.</p><p>Now, as the foundation he had accomplished with the Heavenly Broad Creed Palm was transferred to that of the Cyclic Heavenly Seal, he would be able to accomplish some minor attainments in it very soon.</p><p>After having stepped into the Essence Talisman Martial Grandmaster realm and condensed his true martial essence talisman, achieving an initial solidifying of his foundations, Yan Zhaoge would now be starting to cultivate in things other than the Peerless Heavenly Scripture.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
