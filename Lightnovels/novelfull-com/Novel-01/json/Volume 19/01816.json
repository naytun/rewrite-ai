We need to handle the matter properly.” The old man urged.</p><p>“Senior uncle, don’t worry. The blessing rain left in the sect is enough to purify the poison of heretics.” The middle-aged man replied.</p><p>The old man nodded, “That will be great.”</p><p>“There are only 120,423 people this time, and it’s getting fewer and fewer.” The middle-aged man said so, but his face showed a happy expression, “When I was adventuring outside, I once brought more than 10,000 people with me. However, I didn’t encounter this number again. So the remnants of heretics are getting smaller and smaller.”</p><p>“Yes.” The old man stroked his beard and smiled, “I heard that there were 3,000 Immortal Domains before the Immortal Court collapsed. All of their worlds had hundreds of millions of people, but now they can no longer stir up any turmoil.”</p><p>The middle-aged man looked at the elated expressions of those juniors from the same sect after disembarking. He could not help but laugh, “They have made great contributions this time, and the Heaven Traversing Pavilion will reward them.”</p><p>Looking at those juniors, the middle-aged man remembered that he was in the same manner back then.</p><p>“Thanks to the Great Dao Monarch for this!” The old man also showed a gratified smile.</p><p>In Daoism’s universe, there was a Heaven Traversing Pavilion in every world.</p><p>Various tasks were published in the pavilion. Every Daoism martial art practitioner could receive them.</p><p>Rewards would be given to those who had completed the mission.</p><p>The rewards included books on martial art techniques, weapons, remarkable pills, and rare treasures. A myriad of things was included.</p><p>What’s more impressive about it was that it was possible to receive martial art empowerment.</p><p>The so-called Heaven Traversing Pavilion referred to work on self-improvement in the face of heavenly fate.</p><p>Although all kinds of rewards were available to help the cultivators improve by leaps and bounds, all of this still depended on their efforts.</p><p>No one else could substitute another person in receiving and completing tasks. Therefore, it was impossible to obtain anything through impersonation too.</p><p>Even if it were a team mission, the pavilion would distinguish each person’s contribution and put an end to the behavior of slacking off while getting merits.</p><p>Above the heavens, there seemed to be a supreme monarch. He would not make mistakes, nor would he be fooled.</p><p>For thousands of years, people had been accustomed to it. There was a trend of prioritizing a solid foundation in martial arts, with everyone striving to make progress.</p><p>For such people, the Heaven Traversing Pavilion seemed to have eyes in the sky, rewarding and helping those who were thrown behind to succeed faster and grow better.</p><p>Daoism’s universe was filled with powerhouses and talented rookies, showing exponential growth.</p><p>“Even though the Heaven Traversing Pavilion’s martial art empowerment’s effect is slightly inferior to Spirit Divinity Overflowing Lid of the devils, there is no ramification to the host. We don’t need to be worried about it.” The middle-aged man sighed and said, “I heard that an ambitious person, who ventured on sinister means, created it in Everlasting Oath Heaven. He intended to use this method to manipulate and control others to build his forces.”</p><p>“That’s right. After that, the Great Dao Monarch overcame his conspiracy, improved this method, and ultimately benefited all sentient beings, benefiting all Daoism descendants.” The old man added, “The Great Dao Monarch eliminated the heretics, set an upright path for Daoism, cleansed the universe, and set up the Heaven Traversing Pavilion to benefit all sentient beings. It is indeed a great deed!”</p><p>The two of them looked into the distance at the same time.</p><p>Over there was a green hill with a small building erected on it.</p><p>The attic was shrouded in brilliance, and the brilliance vaguely formed a vein that spread across the world.</p><p>The brilliance gathered above the attic and turned into a dazzling light beam as if it was the pillar running this world.</p><p>The light beam exited this world and traveled within Origin Scholar Heaven.</p><p>Similarly, the soaring light beam existed in every other world.</p><p>Numerous light beams passed through the domains of Origin Scholar Heaven together and then converged at the other universe.</p><p>That was Zhuluo Royal Reed Heavens.</p><p>In Zhuluo Royal Reed Heavens, there was a separate world. A burly man with his skin akin to jade stone sat upright in it.</p><p>Numerous streams of light converged on this man.</p><p>In Sky beyond Skies, Yan Zhaoge looked up at the sky with a smile on his face at Broad Creed Mountain.</p><p>From his perspective, he could see the North Ocean Clone’s body. Besides the surging flow of lights, there was uncountable brilliance gathered.</p><p>Although these lights were faint and illusory, they were great in numbers, corresponding to the countless Daoism martial art practitioners who received tasks in the Heaven Traversing Pavilion.</p><p>For the North Ocean Clone, who had attained the Grand Heavenly Realm, it was naturally not a problem to accurately handle various system demands.</p><p>He could accurately distinguish the locations and treat the data. At the same time, he would not report to Yan Zhaoge about the personal privacy of those junior martial art practitioners and deleted the relevance of memory. At the same time, he had to supervise everything in the case of possible loopholes to prevent cheating.</p><p>“Up to now, the martial art empowerment can only reach up to the Martial Saints and Immortal Bridge.” Yan Zhaoge smiled at Feng Yunsheng next to him, “However, there should be a major breakthrough shortly. It should be possible to reach the tenth level of Martial Saint Realm, the Human Exalt’s realm.”</p><p>Feng Yunsheng said, “It is good to have such fruitful results, but several other forces have paid more and more attention to this.”</p><p>Naturally, the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus had the loudest reaction.</p><p>All along, the most significant advantage of heretic arts was that it had lower requirements for the talent of martial art practitioners, making cultivation progress easier and faster.</p><p>Corresponding to the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus and the previous Immortal Court, they were characterized by many martial art practitioners, which could be quickly replenished after casualties.</p><p>In theory, as long as there was enough population and faith power, they could have as many martial art practitioners at any level, except for the more challenging level of Grand Heavenly Realm.</p><p>Assuming there was no upper limit on the population and faith power, the mighty Grand Heavenly Realm combatants would continue to emerge.</p><p>But in the past few thousand years, the Daoism Lineage’s martial art practitioners had exploded in numbers.</p><p>The number increased significantly, and the speed of progress also stunned the other factions.</p><p>The Blessed Lands of the White Lotus watched the number of Daoism Lineage’s martial art practitioners snowball with their cultivation growing rapidly.</p><p>Even the talent requirements for martial art practitioners were no longer so demanding.</p><p>Overall, the threshold for learning martial arts was still higher than heretics. However, the average level of the individual strength of Daoism Lineage martial art practitioners was far superior to heretics.</p><p>After some frictions and conflicts, the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus was somewhat beaten to confusion.</p><p>They used to rely on numbers to make up for the gap in individual combat strength.</p><p>Currently, the gap in individual strength remained the same, but Blessed Lands of the White Lotus lost the advantage in numbers.</p><p>The Immortal Court remnants, who had become street rats, were in an even more miserable state.</p><p>The direct impact of the substantial increase in the number of Daoism martial art practitioners was that more and more people were encircling and killing Immortal Court heretics!</p><p>It was true that Heaven Traversing Pavilion could only apply martial art empowerment to the martial art practitioners of the cultivation below the Exalt Martial Saint Realm.</p><p>However, there were more and more strong Martial Saint Realm powerhouses. With the numbers getting more extensive on the foundational level, it became easier to have higher realm Daoism descendants emerge.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge’s method was not to promote growth but to ruin the foundation. Therefore, it would not affect the improvement of Daoism’s descendants.</p><p>Orthodox Daoism reached a new peak and developed rapidly, which was expected by the Western Pure Lands, the demon races, and the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus.</p><p>But it was so fast that everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p>Find out what happens next by getting early access to chapters with Patreon!
