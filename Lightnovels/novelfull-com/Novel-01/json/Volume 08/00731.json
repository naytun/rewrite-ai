There was also merely him, Yan Zhaoge, here in the World beyond Worlds who could use the Heavenly Broad Creed Palm.</p><p>Then, where exactly could Bai Ziming have seen someone else executing the Heavenly Broad Creed Palm before?</p><p>Yan Zhaoge’s gaze focused as he looked earnestly at Bai Ziming, “I wonder where it was and by whom that Mister Bai saw someone using this palm?”</p><p>Bai Ziming could clearly feel Yan Zhaoge turning solemn.</p><p>Thus, he replied just as solemnly, “Little Friend Yan should know that this old man is not from the World beyond Worlds.”</p><p>“The world I came from is called the Floating Gate World. It was after attaining the Seeing Divinity stage that I ascended from there, arriving at the World beyond Worlds.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge nodded slowly, It was precisely because he knew about this that he was pondering on it.</p><p>Then, he heard Bai Ziming continuing, “When in the Floating Gate World, this old man once met someone who could overturn the heavens with a single palm, enveloping the entire surrounding area with vigorous, mighty force. It was truly remarkable.”</p><p>He looked at Yan Zhaoge and said, “That person is called Yuan Zhengfeng. He only has a single arm. He suddenly appeared in my Floating Gate World a few years ago. Many, this old man included, all suspect that he hails from some other world.”</p><p>Hearing his words, Yan Zhaoge heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>It was really his Grand Master, Broad Creed Mountain’s old Chief Yuan Zhengfeng who had been missing for so long!</p><p>In that great battle in the Earth Domain that year where the crevice to the Nine Underworlds had been sealed, Yuan Zhengfeng had been lost amidst the chaotic flows of space, vanishing without a trace with his whereabouts and condition totally unknown.</p><p>This was something that everyone of Broad Creed Mountain, Yan Zhaoge included, had been worrying over.</p><p>While they had all comforted one another, saying that the old Chief would definitely be blessed by the heavens, with no news of him forthcoming, it was just hard for them to set their minds at ease.</p><p>This was especially when no clues existed and there was also no place to start searching. Yan Zhaoge had been totally helpless about this.</p><p>Now that news had finally come of him, Yan Zhaoge was finally able to rest at ease, his heart relaxing greatly.</p><p>Looking at Bai Ziming, he said, “Just so Mister Bai knows, the person whom you speak of is a senior of this Yan’s sect. We lost all contact with him previously, yet had no way to search for him at all.”</p><p>Bai Ziming said, “So it was really like that. You can rest easy, Little Friend Yan. While Mister Yuan only has one arm, that was still a matter of before I came to the Floating Gate World.”</p><p>“His life in the Floating Gate World has been relatively smooth. He even became a guest Elder of a major sect of our Floating Gate World. Before this old man ascended, at least, he was living well.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge nodded slightly, “That’s good then.”</p><p>Bai Ziming now sighed, “Speaking of him, while this Mister Yuan only has one arm, his martial arts are really not to be taken lightly.”</p><p>“This old man has encountered him several times before. From watching his battles with others, I was able to recognise Little Friend Yan’s palm technique just now.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge cupped his hands towards Bai Ziming, “I wonder if Mister Bai has a way to determine the location of that Floating Gate World from whence you came? This Yan desires to make a trip to your Floating Gate World-I wonder if it would be convenient?”</p><p>Bai Ziming answered, “While it is a little difficult, this can be attempted.”</p><p>Looking at Yan Zhaoge, he asked, “Is Little Friend Yan in a hurry to meet with Mister Yuan?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge replied emotionally, “To tell you the truth, it is indeed so.”</p><p>Bai Ziming smiled, “Little Friend Yan doesn’t actually have to be in a hurry then. Perhaps you will end up reuniting in the World beyond Worlds sometime soon.”</p><p>“When this old man ascended, the fellow Daoists of our Floating Gate World were invited to watch the process. This Mister Yuan was present then as well. This old man saw that he was merely a half-step away from refining his acupoints and seeing Divinity.”</p><p>“Back then, this old man even joked that after me, he would most likely be the next person of the Floating Gate World to ascend.”</p><p>Hearing his words, Yan Zhaoge was instead taken aback, “Oh?”</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Yan Zhaoge asked Bai Ziming about the timeflow of the Floating Gate World in comparison to that of the World beyond Worlds before then matching this with that of the Eight Extremities World.</p><p>After having compared these, Yan Zhaoge could not help but wonder aloud, “Grand Master has so swiftly reached the peak of the third level of the Martial Saint realm, the late Merging Avatar stage?”</p><p>While his father, Yan Di, had surpassed all his predecessors, his Grand Master Yuan Zhengfeng was similarly outstanding in terms of talent and strength.</p><p>Due to his past injuries, Yuan Zhengfeng had once been stuck at the Transcending Mortality Martial Grandmaster stage for a very long time.</p><p>While he had been helpless about it, it had also caused his accumulation to be extremely abundant as his path after having Transcended Mortality and entered Sainthood had thus been very smooth.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge did not doubt that if not for the simultaneous tribulations in the East Sea and the Earth Domain that year, so long as Yuan Zhengfeng had been given some time, he would likely have been able to succeed in his breakthrough into the mid Merging Avatar stage within a short period of time.</p><p>It would have been far less difficult for him than it had been for the past Huang Guanglie.</p><p>After all, Yuan Zhengfeng’s talent and strength had already surpassed Huang Guanglie’s in the past.</p><p>Still, saying that Yuan Zhengfeng had been able to reach the peak of the Merging Avatar stage within just a few short years, even being able to attempt a breakthrough into the Seeing Divinity stage, was this not rather too fast as it surpassed all one’s predictions?</p><p>After all, not everyone would be able to progress as swiftly as Yan Zhaoge’s Northern Ocean Clone.</p><p>While the Northern Ocean Clone had been able to advance three consecutive steps in just a mere few years, having broken through space and seen true Divinity, there had been many different factors that had made this possible, with many fortuitous encounters having played a part.</p><p>In other words, it was just a lucky thing. It could not be used as a benchmark to judge the majority.</p><p>Speaking of how hard it was to refine one’s acupoints and see Divinity, one need just look at the Purple Sun Martial Saint Zhang Chao of the Eight Extremities World’s Sacred Sun Clan in the past.</p><p>It was the same for that descendant of Sheng Lingzi’s lineage who had been slain by Yan Zhaoge while in charge of transporting the Heaven Bearing Ceremonial Fragrance, the Earth Ocean Lung Crystals and those other treasures back then.</p><p>That old man was of the same generation as Kang Ping and Madame Kang, his age and seniority both being higher than that of brothers Kang Maosheng and Kang Jinyuan. Yet, he was still just at the late Merging Avatar stage like the two of them were.</p><p>Even in the World beyond Worlds, it was not an easy thing for a martial practitioner who possessed outstanding talent to advance from the early Merging Avatar stage to the early Seeing Divinity stage.</p><p>Bai Ziming having evaluated Yuan Zhengfeng as possibly being able to break through into the Seeing Divinity stage within a short period of time, this would mean that Yuan Zhengfeng was not merely just at the late Merging Avatar stage, instead already being at the verge of achieving a breakthrough.</p><p>“Could there be some special reason?” As he wondered this, Yan Zhaoge said to Bai Ziming, “Where one lands after ascension cannot be determined. I would like Mister Bai’s help to guide the way, such that this Yan will be able to head to the Floating Gate World somewhat more smoothly.”</p><p>Bai Ziming nodded, “That is naturally fine. It is just that this man too cannot ascertain it for sure. If this old man were to personally return to the Floating Gate World, I would be able to accurately set a marker. Now, we can only look to Little Friend Yan yourself.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge exhaled slowly, “I will be troubling Mister Bai.”</p><p>Bai Ziming took out a jade pendant and handed it to Yan Zhaoge who received it, infusing his true essence within as per his instructions.</p><p>A jade green fog instantly arose from the surface of the jade pendant.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
