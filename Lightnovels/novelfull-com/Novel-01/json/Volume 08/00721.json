As long as one controlled it properly, it would not be like the time when he had slain Nong Yuxuan’s group where it had been recognised so easily.</p><p>Comparatively speaking, the Peerless Heavenly Scripture was less easy to conceal.</p><p>Now that he had the Dim Radiant Twelve Arts, however, the situation had improved greatly.</p><p>Therefore, Yan Zhaoge was considerably interested in the Dim Radiant Twelve Arts.</p><p>“While it was meagre, having been able to himself comprehend the true intent of peerless infinity, the Dim Radiant Emperor was indeed a hero of his time,” Yan Zhaoge smacked his lips, “Still, it was precisely because of this as well that he blocked his own way forward.”</p><p>Peerless Infinity was even before the initial ‘one’, being the beginning of the beginning as well as the end of the end.</p><p>The Lord of Primordial Beginning had been one of a kind. Similarly, peerless infinity was also one of a kind.</p><p>The second scripture of the Primordial Heavenly Scriptures, the Origin Heavenly Scripture, could only be cultivated by one person to the point of major completion. The Peerless Heavenly Scripture only allowed one person to cultivate in it in the first place.</p><p>From ancient times till now, it was not just the Dim Radiant Emperor Yin Tianxia who had possessed the ability to comprehend the true intent of peerless infinity.</p><p>However, all of them had given up on this path without exception.</p><p>That was because the Peerless Heavenly Scripture was already at the very peak.</p><p>While it was not that things of the future could never exceed those of the past and the path of seeking the dao always continued, the problem was that the Lord of Primordial Beginning had already successfully Transcended.</p><p>This proved that he had virtually already fully traversed the path that he had walked on.</p><p>If people wanted to follow the same path, the result was that it would get narrower and narrower till finally a path no longer existed. One would still have to return to the Peerless Heavenly Scripture at the end of the day.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge did not know whether Yin Tianxia had realised this. In having comprehended the true intent of peerless infinity and created the Dim Radiant Twelve Arts that surpassed the Dim Radiant Scripture of the past, he had brought himself and the Dim Radiant Sect to unprecedented heights.</p><p>Yet, if he had failed to find another path and leap over this obstacle, those heights would have been his endpoint.</p><p>No one could know for sure what exactly the past Yin Tianxia had been thinking.</p><p>With him having died early in his prime, all his future possibilities had therefore faded into oblivion.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge analysed the Dim Radiant Twelve Arts whilst corroborating it with the Peerless Heavenly Scripture as countless thoughts flashed through his mind.</p><p>At any one time, there could only be one person who cultivated in the Peerless Heavenly Scripture.</p><p>After one person had achieved an initial comprehension of the Peerless Heavenly Scripture and was on the right track in beginning to cultivate in it, even if others knew of its existence, they would only be able to gaze over and sigh admiringly.</p><p>When he had chosen to cultivate in that as his foundational martial art to consolidate his cultivation base with back in the Eight Extremities World that year, he too had rejoiced at the fact that this spot had been unoccupied.</p><p>At the end of the day, from days past till now, the Peerless Heavenly Scripture had always been one of the top martial arts. Sometimes, in some scenarios, the ‘one of’ could even be removed from this.</p><p>Still, he had wondered back then-were there others who had intentions on this powerful martial art?</p><p>Was it just him who grasped the essence of the Peerless Heavenly Scripture in this world?</p><p>He had not heard of anyone cultivating in the Peerless Heavenly Scripture in pre-Great Calamity times…</p><p>There seemed to be something amiss here.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge sat in the meditative position on the ground and pondered even as he silently circulated his cultivation base.</p><p>Light that was half-bright and half-dim, half-white and half-black gradually appeared on his body. As it flickered, it was like blurry radiance that was neither bright nor dim had enveloped his entire body.</p><p>With the Peerless Heavenly Scripture as his foundation, Yan Zhaoge cultivated in the Dim Radiant Twelve Arts far more easily and swiftly than anyone else could.</p><p>Ceasing in his thoughts and awakening from his ponderings, Yan Zhaoge saw Pan-Pan already lazing happily about amidst the mountain of treasures and Ah Hu smiling happily till even his teeth could not be seen as he clutched a pile of rare, precious Green Deep Golden Sheets.</p><p>“Huh?” Yan Zhaoge suddenly felt curious. Hadn’t a young, greedy girl just been added to their team?</p><p>From his earlier impressions of her, she should logically have dived headlong into a pile of treasures just like Pan-Pan had.</p><p>Where was she?</p><p>Swivelling his head and seeing her, Yan Zhaoge very nearly laughed out loud.</p><p>He saw Xiao Ai currently standing near Feng Yunsheng as she was nervously staring at her intently.</p><p>Being appraised all over by her, Feng Yunsheng did not feel uncomfortable. Instead, she was smiling, her interest seemingly piqued as she returned Xiao Ai’s gaze.</p><p>In the end, it was Xiao Ai who could not hold on as she nervously ran back over to Yan Zhaoge’s side, asking him, “Young Master, Young Master! This person…this person shouldn’t …she shouldn’t be…”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge asked casually, “Shouldn’t be what?”</p><p>Xiao Ai grit her teeth before asking in a hushed whisper, “She shouldn’t be Young Mistress, right?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge smiled, glancing at Feng Yunsheng, “Why’re you asking this? Where’s your proof? Must all travelling pairs be couples?”</p><p>Feng Yunsheng appeared similarly interested, being curious as to how Xiao Ai would respond.</p><p>Xiao Ai’s lips twitched as she revealed an expression like she was on the brink of crying, “The way she looks at you is different! More importantly…the way Young Master looks at her is different too!”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge and Feng Yunsheng both laughed upon hearing her words.</p><p>Xiao Ai nearly hugged Yan Zhaoge’s thigh as she wailed piteously, “You can’t do this, Young Master! Such a handsome and outstanding figure like you should traverse a clearing of ten thousand flowers, being unstained by a single blade of grass!”</p><p>“Young Master, don’t look for a Young Mistress, okay? Single is perfection!”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge knew not if he should laugh or cry, “From what you say, I should be a bachelor forever?”</p><p>Xiao Ai looked piteously at Yan Zhaoge, nodding repeatedly.</p><p>Feeling exasperated whilst also amused, Yan Zhaoge simply flicked her forehead.</p><p>Feng Yunsheng could not help but smile as well.</p><p>Xiao Ai said dispiritedly, “Young Master, now that you have Young Mistress, this maid will have to demote you from an A+ to just an A…”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge could not help but smile, “Don’t be like this! Let’s discuss it a little. You should adjust your benchmark as appropriate. Your original one really just isn’t humane at all!”</p><p>Ah Hu’s eyeballs rolled as he scooted over before Yan Zhaoge, asking him secretly, “Young Master, isn’t Miss Feng already together with you now? Have you eaten her up yet?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge chuckled, “Not yet. As compared to me, her body and bones are currently a little weak. They wouldn’t be able to take it.”</p><p>Feng Yunsheng did not appear flustered as she said smilingly, “Many thanks for your consideration.”</p><p>Their relationship no longer being the same, Yan Zhaoge could already be very open with his words.</p><p>He appraised Feng Yunsheng all over before smiling rather dirtily, “Actually, there could be many other ways.”</p><p>Feng Yunsheng rolled her eyes exasperatedly, “For example?”</p><p>“For example…” Yan Zhaoge dragged out his words as he glanced sneakily towards Feng Yunsheng, finally deciding not to go overboard as his gaze shifted downwards and finally landed on her hands.</p><p>Feng Yunsheng bared her teeth in a grin, chuckling, “Fine, lie down.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge chuckled, “Relax, I’ll nicely lie in a ‘木’shape for you and let you do whatever you want.”</p><p>Feng Yunsheng was taken aback, “It should be the ‘大’shape, right?”</p><p>She reacted a moment later, putting her hands on her waist and saying, “It’ll be the ‘太’shape then.”</p><p>Now it was Yan Zhaoge’s turn to be taken aback, “Is there a huge difference between ‘木’and ‘太’?”</p><p>Feng Yunsheng’s smile contained a rare charm to it, “The so-called ‘木’ shape has it still attached to you, while the ‘太’ shape has it broken. Just randomly placing it anywhere between your legs is fine.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge, “…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
