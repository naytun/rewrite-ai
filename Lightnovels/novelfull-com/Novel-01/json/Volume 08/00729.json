Though it possessed great power, it was not sufficiently nimble.</p><p>The Southern Exalt’s lineage cultivated in the Phoenix True Form Scripture, cultivating the true form of the phoenix through attaining the true intent of the five virtues.</p><p>If they had successfully cultivated in the Nether Virtue White Qi, the heavens providing them a sliver of a chance to live, it would not be easy to leave them behind if they were focusing fully on escaping.</p><p>It would only be possible if their opponent possessed a clear advantage in strength or some special technique.</p><p>With Zheng Ming controlling the Riding Wind Heavenly Scripture, his opponent would have been pressed to stand against him. Yet, he had not bothered fighting it out with Zheng Ming as he had instead concentrated on fleeing, finally still having managed to escape successfully.</p><p>Instead, due to Yan Zhaoge, it was Wang Hui who had been caught and prevented from fleeing.</p><p>Bai Ziming and that North Sea Sword Pavilion Elder were both feeling rather desolate. Still, they had to admit that if not for them having coincidentally received Yan Zhaoge’s help, there would indeed have been a high chance of Wang Hui and her companion escaping.</p><p>Seeing the Riding Wind Heavenly Vessel, Wang Hui sighed helplessly towards the sky and gave up.</p><p>Her companion of the peak of the late Seeing Divinity stage had been able to flee from the Riding Wind Heavenly Vessel. Yet, she lacked the ability to do so.</p><p>Zheng Ming struck out with his palm, a streak of multi-coloured light instantly descending from the Riding Wind Heavenly Vessel and sweeping Wang Hui up and away.</p><p>Wang Hui did not resist. Still, she stared fixatedly at Yan Zhaoge, as if wanting to imprint his figure into her memory.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge kept the Myriad Dragon Palace, following Bai Ziming’s group aboard the Riding Wind Heavenly Vessel.</p><p>After they had exchanged greetings, Zheng Ming said, “This Zheng is greatly thankful for your righteous assistance. We will not let this negatively affect you. If the Southern Exalt brings the matter up afterwards, our Master will deal with it for you.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge’s trio nodded, smiling, “You’re welcome.”</p><p>Zheng Ming looked at Yan Zhaoge, saying, “Was Little Friend Yan invited over this time or was it coincidental?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge smiled, “It was merely coincidental. Still, it was good that I could be of use.”</p><p>Zheng Ming nodded, “I will soon be escorting our captured target back to Golden Court Mountain for Master to judge over this matter. Does Little Friend Yan want to accompany me to Golden Court Mountain in going to meet him?”</p><p>Before Yan Zhaoge could answer, Zheng Ming added, “It is fine as well if you still want to continue remaining in the Royal Reed Sea. My eldest apprentice-brother has arrived. I will introduce you to him, and with him watching over you, there is no need to worry about the Southern Exalt’s people coming over and looking for trouble.”</p><p>As he spoke, he was also looking towards that North Sea Sword Pavilion Elder.</p><p>That North Sea Sword Pavilion Elder’s expression changed slightly, “What Mister Zheng is saying is that the ‘Shadow Mountain Sword King’ Lin Hanhua has arrived?”</p><p>The ‘Shadow Mountain Sword King’ Lin Hanhua was an expert of the eighth level of the Martial Saint realm, the mid Immortal Bridge stage, and a disciple of the Southeastern Exalt.</p><p>The usual affairs of Golden Court Mountain were all handled by him. Unless the incident was something that was of exceptional importance, the Southeastern Exalt would not be alerted.</p><p>It was also rumoured that Lin Hanhua had a deep background which was not just limited to a disciple of the Southeastern Exalt.</p><p>While Lin Hanhua did not always remain in Golden Court Mountain to cultivate like the Southeastern Exalt did, sometimes leaving to travel to the outside world, he seldom came to the Royal Reed Sea.</p><p>The last time Lin Hanhua had come to the Royal Reed Sea was over a hundred years ago when the foreign Grand Xuan Dynasty had established their rule there.</p><p>After a series of close talks, Lin Hanhua had represented the Southeastern Exalt in allowing King Xuanwen’s group to remain in the Royal Reed Sea.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge stroked his lower chin.</p><p>With things having proven now that King Xuanwen and Shen Lingzi had possessed ulterior motives all these years, it appeared that Lin Hanhua had been a little hasty in making his decision back then.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge felt that how this Shadow Mountain Sword King viewed him would be hard to predict.</p><p>“I have long heard of Mister Lin’s famed name. Having the opportunity to meet him, it is surely good,” Yan Zhaoge said even as he pondered.</p><p>Everyone else was naturally willing as well.</p><p>The Riding Wind Heavenly Vessel turned, shooting off into the distance. Observing the direction that they were travelling in, Yan Zhaoge found that the Riding Wind Heavenly Vessel was travelling in the direction of the branch altar of the Dim Darkness Sect where he had left his marker earlier.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge was rather surprised, “Is the Shadow Mountain Sword King staying at the Dim Darkness Sect as a guest?”</p><p>Zheng Ming sighed, “That is not so. The Star Plucking Practitioner Guan Lide suddenly came to the Royal Reed Sea, ferociously attacking the headquarters of the Dim Darkness Sect.”</p><p>“I heard that it is because he was played by the Dim Darkness Sect in the matter of the Dim Radiant Mausoleum. His frustration turned into fury and he came seeking vengeance.”</p><p>Hearing his words, Yan Zhaoge’s expression instantly turned rather strange.</p><p>Zheng Ming said, “Senior Guan made it clear that he only did this for revenge for what the Dim Darkness Sect did in the Dim Radiant Mausoleum.”</p><p>“Eldest apprentice-brother who just happened to be in the Royal Reed Sea hurried over to discuss it with him, barely managing to secure the legacies of the Dim Darkness Sect. Still, the Dim Darkness Sect’s headquarters was still broken through with countless experts of theirs thus perishing.”</p><p>Zheng Ming said, “Senior Guan left, but the Dim Darkness Sect was very nearly decimated as well. Elder apprentice-brother had to remain there for the time being, and he should still be there now.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge asked, “Is Chief Zhou, Zhou Haosheng there?”</p><p>Zheng Ming nodded, “Chief Zhou suffered grave injuries. If not for eldest-apprentice-brother’s interference, he might have been slain by Senior Guan on the spot.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge sighed as well. It was probably that just after Zhou Haosheng’s group had returned from the mausoleum, Guan Lide had immediately come knocking.</p><p>It might be that Guan Lide had thought to wait for them outside of the World beyond Worlds, covertly taking them down while also simultaneously obtaining the riches with none the wiser.</p><p>Afterwards, not having been able to intercept them, he had simply charged into the Royal Reed Sea.</p><p>The side effects of the Dim Darkness Sect’s Zhou Haosheng having gone all out and thrown aside all reservations in fighting for the Dim Radiant Mausoleum now began to show.</p><p>If not for Lin Hanhua having arrived, the Dim Darkness Sect would likely have been thoroughly wiped off the surface of the Royal Reed Sea for good.</p><p>The Dim Darkness Sect had not obtained anything valuable from the Dim Radiant Mausoleum. They had been surpassed by the Radiant Light Sect who had arrived afterwards, finally having been forced to retreat from the mausoleum prematurely.</p><p>Otherwise, against Chief Luo Zhiyuan of the Radiant Light Sect with the Dim Radiant Lamp and the Sun Moon Wheels in hand, most of them would probably have met their ends right there and then.</p><p>It was just that life was a fickle creature. If Zhou Haosheng and the others were to know what had happened with the Dim Radiant Wheel afterwards, what expressions might show on their faces?</p><p>The North Sea Sword Pavilion Elder said in surprise, “I only heard that the main altar of the Dim Darkness Sect that was being rebuilt was taken down before it could even be completed. Still, I did not know who did it. Who would have thought that amidst all the speculations, the Star Plucking Practitioner was actually the perpetrator, with the Shadow Mountain Sword King involved as well.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge pondered for a moment before asking, “What is the Radiant Light Sect up to right now?”</p><p>At his question, the other party snapped out of his reverie, his expression becoming even stranger, “Now this is a curious thing. The Radiant Light Sect has not shown any movements at all. If it were usually, they would long since have made use of the chance and thoroughly wiped out their foes.”</p><p>As the Southeastern Exalt did not like outsiders staging a robbery amidst a fire, setting their designs on the Dim Radiant Mausoleum, while Guan Lide had said that it was only for revenge, Lin Hanhua still had room to intervene in this.</p><p>Still, the Southeastern Exalt and Lin Hanhua would not intervene in the conflict between the Radiant Light Sect and the Dim Darkness Sect.</p><p>As to the North Sea Sword Pavilion Elder’s bemusement, Yan Zhaoge knew that Luo Zhiyuan and the others of the Radiant Light Sect were currently still trapped amidst chaotic flows of space, unable to return.</p><p>It would originally have been a great chance to attack the Radiant Light Sect. Sadly, their natural ally, the Dim Darkness Sect, had suffered a major tribulation as well, ending up in an even worse state than their hated foe.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge lightly rubbed his temples, thinking, “Should I risk it?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
