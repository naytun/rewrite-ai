Now, he had to make good use of the time to carry out projections on it within his head.</p><p>However, to Yan Zhaoge, it was not like there was completely nowhere to start.</p><p>“It is also originated from the Clear Qi lineage. However, having been improved by generations of Broad Creed Mountain experts, it is already greatly different,” Yan Zhaoge gradually came to an understanding of it within his heart, “It is a pretty intricate formation.”</p><p>“Despite earlier having taken two Anti-Suns that have the effect of breaking formations, causing the changes in the formation to be rather severe, this can still be remedied and corrected.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge gazed in the direction of Broad Creed Mountain whilst also unceasingly projecting changes in the formation, “Helping father to regain control of it would be hard. However, the control of the formation can be temporarily stripped from Xin Dongping, shifting it over to one of us in the three established positions.”</p><p>As Yan Zhaoge made projections on the formation, Ah Hu was left with nothing to do, but he did not go far, instead remaining standing there, guarding over Yan Zhaoge, remaining vigilant over all the changes in the surrounding region.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hong Wen led a group of Broad Creed Mountain martial practitioners, dispersing to kill all the Decimating Abyss martial practitioners who had entered the city alongside Zhu Qian.</p><p>As Yan Zhaoge analysed the formation, his heart suddenly moved.</p><p>Standing at the human position, he could feel another force integrating into the Clear Qi Grand Formation.</p><p>That force originated from the ‘earth’ position of the three positions-heaven, earth and human.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge closed his eyes, his mind entering deep within the formation.</p><p>Within the dark space of consciousness, countless spirit patterns that flickered with white light surfaced.</p><p>A golden dot of light was visible beneath Yan Zhaoge’s feet, at the boundary of the grand formation of white light, representing the ‘human’ position that Yan Zhaoge was currently at.</p><p>In the distance, at another end of the grand formation of white light, another golden dot lit up.</p><p>“Is it senior apprentice-aunt Fu or Elder Zhang?” Yan Zhaoge’s heart eased, his plan already two thirds successful.</p><p>Opening his eyes, Yan Zhaoge could also feel that that terrifying aura of the Nine Underworlds that threw people’s minds into chaos and disorder also seemed to be slowly weakening.</p><p>As he gazed far into the distance in the direction of Broad Creed Mountain, he could vaguely see that the black devilish qi suffusing the air above Broad Creed Mountain that surged into the heavens had dimmed somewhat.</p><p>“Good!” Yan Zhaoge nodded, letting out a long breath, “Over at junior apprentice-sister Feng’s side, it looks like she has also passed my technique to suppress the Devilish Domain Grand Formation over to second apprentice-uncle. With second apprentice-uncle’s cultivation base as well as understanding towards the Decimating Abyss and the Nine Underworlds, such immediate effects have been seen.”</p><p>The previously disadvantageous situation was currently swinging towards them bit by bit!</p><p>Yan Zhaoge stood in the intersection of the two long streets, surrounded by a massive rune, countless spirit patterns extending into the distance, connected to the Clear Qi Grand Formation.</p><p>Feeling the various changes in the circulation of the formation, Yan Zhaoge unceasingly made projections and calculations within his heart.</p><p>“The human position and the earth position have already been established. As soon as the heaven position is in order, a grand reversal can be secured in a single go!”</p><p>The ‘人’ character beneath Yan Zhaoge’s feet shone a bright gold, seemingly leading innumerable wills to congregate at this point.</p><p>Under the common power of the Clear Qi Grand Formation and the ‘人’ character, within the city, the originally restless, unstable hearts of the people gradually began to calm at this moment.</p><p>While they still felt panicked, no longer were they influenced by the aura of the Nine Underworlds, infinitely magnifying the negative thoughts within their hearts.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge looked in the direction of Broad Creed Mountain, then turned his gaze elsewhere.</p><p>There, the ‘天’ character ought to be established by Shi Tie and Xu Fei as projected by Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>However, feeling the changes in the Clear Qi Grand Formation, Yan Zhaoge found that they had still yet to successfully establish the heaven position.</p><p>For this technique of his, all three positions had to undergo simultaneous circulation of formations before it could take effect, wresting back control of Broad Creed Mountain’s guardian grand formation from Xin Dongping’s hands in one go.</p><p>In his predictions, Shi Tie’s route had been the most stable one.</p><p>However, with nothing having happened with so much time having passed, Yan Zhaoge’s heart gradually grew anxious.</p><p>Before the technique was completely unleashed, he could not leave the human position on his own, all he could do now being wait where he was.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge knit his brows tightly, focused on the direction of the heaven position, his expression grave as it had never been before.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
