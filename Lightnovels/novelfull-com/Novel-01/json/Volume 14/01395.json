Such chances are truly scarce for us.” Ling Qing said, “However, it’s similarly beneficial to the Nine Underworlds as well.”</p><p>Gao Han walked within the boundless void, and his gaze slowly deepened, “Which is why their current calmness is so abnormal. Other than the Wood Devil appearing out of nowhere, no other actions could be seen.”</p><p>“How’s it with Daoist Chen’s side?” Ling Qing was asking about Chen Xuanzong.</p><p>Gao Han sighed, “If it weren’t for the Young Heavenly Lord interfering in the past, our matters would’ve been settled. The Roving Jade Heaven’s Daoist Gao and Daoist Li would also perish on the spot after the rebirth of the Water Devil.”</p><p>Ling Qing said calmly, “If it weren’t for your interference, the Water Devil wouldn’t have obtained the chance to rebirth in Daoist Chen’s disciple’s body so easily.”</p><p>“Then, the matters of Ketu would be exposed much earlier.” With an innocent face, Gao Han said, “I can’t do anything about it as well. Moreover…”</p><p>His expression became more serious, “Moreover, we can’t just keep procrastinating. Ultimately, we would still have to go through this. The Water Devil himself coveted Chen Xuanzong’s body the most. Even the Nine Underworlds hopes that the Water Devil would rebirth using Chen Xuanzong’s body.”</p><p>“In the past, the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor and the North Star Emperor had instructed Jian Shunhua to seize the Devil of Aged Metal’s authority. To their surprise, she did things her way and got too greedy.” Ling Qing said slowly, “The matters regarding the Devil of Aged Metal had been set aside. After so many years, no other movements related to him were heard.”</p><p>“It’s been thousands of years since Yin Shiyang. Was there no other incarnation suitable for the Devil of Aged Metal?” asked Ling Qing as she looked at Gao Han.</p><p>Gao Han said, “Eight hundred years ago, someone resembling him had appeared. Only, the Devil of Aged Metal barely had any movement. I’ve always assumed that it was thanks to Jian Shunhua. From the looks of it now, it’s different from what I expected.”</p><p>He laughed, “The Nine Underworlds aren’t willing to lower their standards as well.”</p><p>“The Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor had passed the black jade bottle over to Daoist Feng. Wasn’t it…” Ling Qing wanted to say something but refrained herself from doing so.</p><p>“Wasn’t it too early. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have lost by her hands this time.” Gao Han continued her sentence. His face was filled with helplessness, “With only her current strength alone, as long as she dares to exert her strength, even the Young Heavenly Lord or a real Heavenly Lord wouldn’t be capable of taking her down.”</p><p>Ling Qing frowned, “You know what I’m talking about.”</p><p>Gao Han corrected his expression, “No matter if it was her or Yan Zhaoge, they both had their sense of propriety. Even if they received the black jade bottle from the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor, they wouldn’t recklessly challenge the Origin Heavenly Tribulation if the time wasn’t ripe. They aren’t idiots.”</p><p>“However, Duo Flowers Converged Crown would easily attract the attention of the Nine Underworlds,” said Ling Qing indifferently.</p><p>Gao Han laughed again, “Coincidentally, the more the Nine Underworlds place their attention on her, the less attention would be placed on Chen Xuanzong and the others.”</p><p>Ling Qing reverted to her calm expression. She lightly shook her head, “If Jian Shunhua didn’t perish, less attention would be placed on her as well.”</p><p>“Indeed.” Gao Han held no objections. He sighed, “However, it might be a little too early. I wonder if the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor has any other plans in mind?”</p><p>Ling Qing remained silent. With her calm expression, she quietly walked by the void.</p><p>Gao Han was already used to her behavior. “I’ll go locate Daoist Chen and the others. Please do keep an eye out of the heretics for me.”</p><p>“Alright.” Ling Qing replied. The two then separated and disappeared by the boundless void together.</p><p>At the same time, Yan Zhaoge and Feng Yunsheng traversed through the void and returned to the Awakened Sky Cosmos.</p><p>“The garrisoned treasure passed down by our Grand Master had finally returned to Broad Creed. At last, I won’t have any regrets when facing our successive Grand Masters in the afterlife.” Holding the Cyclic Heavenly Seal fragment in his hands, Yuan Zhengfeng’s expression was filled with emotions.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge smiled and said, “Not only the successive Grand Masters. It’s a joyous occasion even for our entire sect as well.”</p><p>Yuan Zhengfeng looked towards the Cyclic Heavenly Seal fragment and smiled as well, “After returning from the Floating Gate World and even standing firmly by the Royal Reed Sea, I’ve only had one more regret – this missing treasure.”</p><p>“At that time, I thought, ‘If the treasure could return one day, I won’t be ashamed to meet my ancestors anymore in the afterlife’.”</p><p>The old man chuckled, “Afterwards, although this item was still in my mind, it wasn’t my only regret anymore.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge understood the transformation in Yuan Zhengfeng’s thoughts. He smiled and said, “Comparing your cultivation to your appropriate age, you’re still considered quite young. Even now, you’re still considered a rising youth, and even a youthful and talented one at that.”</p><p>“You’re teasing me?” Yuan Zhengfeng chuckled. He first nodded and later shook his head, “What you said isn’t wrong either. While the increment of cultivation was the foundation of everything, all the matters I’ve experienced during the past few years gave me a drastic change.”</p><p>With a broader vision, his state of mind would naturally be different.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge smiled and repeated, “Everything you’ve done in the past was for your sect and your apprentice-brothers. As a sect’s disciple, you continuously pushed forward in the path of martial arts. Grand Master, you’ve always been sincere in everything and had never slacked off at all.”</p><p>“Without jumping out of the well and getting the opportunity to view the outside world, no one wouldn’t have known that the world was such a broad place. Of course, all the past experiences I had shouldn’t be described using ignorance, perfunctory, or even mediocracy.” He chuckled.</p><p>Yuan Zhengfeng lightly tapped on Yan Zhaoge using his finger and smiled, “The past had been interesting, and the present is interesting in another way as well. I wonder if the future would be much more interesting?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge happily said, “Just as you previously said, everyone in this era played a part in flourishing Daoism after the Great Calamity.”</p><p>“Indeed.” Yuan Zhengfeng was first fascinated, and his expression suddenly turned serious, “We shouldn’t ever forget our benefactor. If we get the chance to locate the Bright Connection Emperor’s corpse, that’ll naturally be for the best. It’s not only because she’s Chuqing’s Grand Master.”</p><p>Although Yan Zhaoge still couldn’t describe the details of the matters thanks to the Immortal Court, Yuan Zhengfeng was still aware of the contributions which the Dim Radiant Emperor – Yi Tianxia and the Bright Connection Emperor – Hu Yuexin had contributed to all the Daoism successors.</p><p>“Don’t worry. I’m aware of that.” Yan Zhaoge’s expression became formal as well. After cupping his hands towards Yuan Zhengfeng, he turned around and left.</p><p>After bringing back the Monkey Race blood, his North Ocean Clone and Pan Pan devoured and refined the blood. Of course, the monkey blood wouldn’t take effect so quickly. They still had to get used to it slowly.</p><p>After all, that was a Monkey Race Small Saint’s demonic blood. In order to allow the North Ocean Clone and Pan Pan, who had yet to ascend to the Immortal Realm, many preparations had to be made.</p><p>On the other hand, under Yan Zhaoge’s control, the Three Brilliances Sacred Water gradually started to display its uses.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge used a portion and saved another portion for himself. This treasure had many sort of uses, after all. Unfortunately, the total amount of Sacred Water was limited.</p><p>After bidding farewell to his mother – Xue Chuqing, and the others, Yan Zhaoge and Feng Yunsheng once again left Sky beyond Skies. They went out of the Awakened Sky Cosmos and returned to the void’s boundless outskirts.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
