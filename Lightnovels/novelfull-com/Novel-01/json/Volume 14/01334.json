He nodded peacefully, “Greetings, Vine Sovereign. Indeed, my grandfather is the Exalted Gold Luminary.”</p><p>“You’re much more outstanding than your ancestor.” The Vine Sovereign did not continue the topic regarding Yan Zhaoge’s identity.</p><p>She merely analyzed Yan Zhaoge’s North Ocean Clone, “Although it’s only a clone, it’s already in the Ninth level Martial Saint Realm. Your main body shouldn’t be far off from ascending to the Immortal Realm, right? Or, have you already managed to achieve it?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge replied frankly, “I’m almost there. I’m confident that I’ll reach it someday.”</p><p>“You’re here for the matters of extracting the Roving Jade Heavens away from the Dao universe. In other words, your control over the Pill Hall’s refinement had gotten much stronger, and the Pill Hall’s cosmos had stabilized even further,” said the Vine Sovereign as she looked at Yan Zhaoge. “You! Are you planning on officially establishing a brand new world, and also taking that step forward with the help of the Pill Hall?”</p><p>“Vine Sovereign, you’re truly brilliant.” Yan Zhaoge smiled. “Indeed, this is my plan.”</p><p>Such opportunities were rare.</p><p>Without the help of the Pill Hall, Yan Zhaoge wouldn’t have the capability of doing so out of thin air.</p><p>Such an opportunity was extremely beneficial for him, who was cultivating the Heavens Opening Scripture.</p><p>At the same time, it also poses a tremendous amount of help for his progress in cultivating the Three Clear arts.</p><p>The path he was taking was already much harder compared to others. The difficulty increased even further as he attempted to pass through the hurdle between a human and an immortal.</p><p>Such an opportunity was practically god-sent. If he managed to utilize it correctly, he would be able to conserve large amounts of effort.</p><p>Usually, shortcuts would be challenging. The availability depended on fate, while some might cause issues in the future.</p><p>However, not only was the shortcut that Yan Zhaoge found harmless, it was even beneficial for him. It was a shortcut able to assist with his future cultivation.</p><p>Such an opportunity won’t even appear every thousand years or even ten thousand years.</p><p>In the past, he risked himself to challenge the Pill Hall’s hall spirit. Now, his harvests were finally paying off one by one.</p><p>Hearing Yan Zhaoge admitting it, although everyone present already had some guesses about it, a wave of complex emotion still appeared within their hearts. At the same time, they were also mildly shocked.</p><p>The Cloud Conquest Emperor had already experienced thousands of years of ups and downs. In fact, he already knew just how outstanding Yan Zhaoge was. However, he still couldn’t help himself from letting out a sigh.</p><p>The Cloud Conquest Emperor had personally participated in the efforts of establishing the Roving Jade Heavens, the place where they were currently at. He had personally experienced the era of advancing to the path of light from the darkness.</p><p>Now, another new world would appear right before his eyes.</p><p>“Youths should truly be regarded with respect. As expected of the Fallen Deity.” The Vine Sovereign nodded. Then, she looked at Yan Zhaoge and said peacefully, “I know your intentions, and they’re great ones. If the Roving Jade Heavens can enter the Pill Hall and drift within the boundless void’s outskirts, the heretics and evil devils wouldn’t be able to locate it so easily.”</p><p>“However, just like how your group left the Dao universe, we can’t execute this without others learning the news about it. Hence, it won’t be as successful. When the time comes, it will attract others’ attention.”</p><p>The Vine Sovereign shook her head, “When that time comes, the enemy’s invasion wouldn’t be beneficial for either you or the Roving Jade Heavens.”</p><p>She stared at Yan Zhaoge, “Although our side and yours holds a grudge against each other, we still belong to the Three Clear Lineage. Since you’ve acquired the Heavenly Court’s Divine Palace’s Pill Hall, you have to be more careful. Don’t just let the devils and heretics reap the benefits in the end.”</p><p>“Indeed, after entering the Pill Hall, it might cause our opponents to chase after us,” said Yan Zhaoge. “However, forgive me for saying so. If the Roving Jade Heavens remains by this universe, your opponents will hold malicious intent towards your Roving Jade Heavens.”</p><p>“The relationship between my father, Vine Sovereign, senior apprentice-uncle Long and I are no secret to others. To locate our Pill Hall, our enemies would be paying close attention to the Roving Jade Heavens.”</p><p>“Everything happened because of me. I’m deeply sorry for involving your faction within. However, other than this plan, I can’t think of any other ways to solve it.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge cupped his hands towards all the Prime Clear big shots present and said in a serious tone.</p><p>The Profound Sovereign – Gao Qingxuan beside him shook her head slowly, “These sort of things are unavoidable. You don’t have to blame yourself for it.”</p><p>Although she was standing below the Vine Sovereign, and no aura of hers was leaking, this green-shirt woman’s presence was the strongest among everyone present.</p><p>The instant Yan Zhaoge entered the cave manor, she was the first person he noticed.</p><p>The Profound Sovereign – Gao Qingxuan was the number one strongest within the Roving Jade Heavens. In fact, among her Prime Clear lineage peers born after the Great Calamity, she was the strongest.</p><p>There was no need to mention how strong she was. With only her title alone, everything would make sense.</p><p>Ever since Suo Mingzhang had achieved Five Qis Unification and ceased to be a Profound Immortal, Gao Qingxuan’s sovereign title had changed from the “Whirlpool Sovereign” to the “Profound Sovereign.”</p><p>She didn’t change it on her own. Instead, everyone else approved of it. At the very least, most people silently approved of it.</p><p>The more top-notch an expert was, the more prideful he would be, which meant he wouldn’t easily allow himself to be bested.</p><p>Unless the disparity between the two were far too great, whether one would win or lose would be uncertain, no matter how excellent the opponent’s reputation was.</p><p>Gao Qingxuan’s title – the Profound Sovereign, held much more deterrence than Yue Zhenbei’s Sword Sovereign title.</p><p>Profound Sovereign. The sovereign among all Profound Immortals, the strongest Profound Immortal.</p><p>Ever since others changed her title to the “Profound Sovereign,” no one could waver Gao Qingxuan’s reputation.</p><p>“Thanks for your understanding, Profound Sovereign.” Yan Zhaoge nodded at Gao Qingxuan.</p><p>In the past, within the entire Roving Jade Heavens, the Profound Sovereign – Gao Qingxuan, was the closest with his grandmother – Di Qinglian.</p><p>The perishment of Di Qinglian had caused great grief to Gao Qingxuan.</p><p>However, unlike the Vine Sovereign, she did not resent Yan Xintang’s lineage’s successor. Instead, she had been reconciling between the two sides.</p><p>Part of the reason was because of the Dragon Spring Emperor, and another part of the reason was how much she missed her junior sister – Di Qinglian.</p><p>As far as Gao Qingxuan knew, although her junior sister had perished very early, Gao Qingxuan knew that the moment Di Qinglian took pride wasn’t when she held her prideful sword towards the entire universe. Instead, it was when she got together with her husband – Yan Xintang.</p><p>Even so, the fact was the deceased was already dead. The hatred of the survivors wasn’t something the deceased would desire to spectate</p><p>Although the Sword Sovereign – Yue Zhenbei’s relationship with the Roving Jade Heavens was horrible, he was still respectful towards the Profound Sovereign – Gao Qingxuan. He would frequently praise Gao Qingxuan when conversing with others.</p><p>Naturally, Yan Zhaoge remembered the friendliness of the Profound Sovereign and the Spring Emperor.</p><p>His Immortal Trapping Sword Manual was gifted by the Profound Sovereign’s family, to begin with.</p><p>“Now, the two heretics factions, the Demon Race, and the orthodox Buddhism are all fighting against each other. Comparatively, the environment is much laxer for us now. It’s the best time to operate the plan,” said Yan Zhaoge. “Now, our opponents are merely surveillance the Dao universe, surveillance the Roving Jade Heavens and the World beyond Worlds. You can’t be too sure when they would try to probe the Roving Jade Heavens by taking action against it.”</p><p>He turned to look at the Vine Sovereign, “If the situation doesn’t force them to do so, our opponents would definitely not massacre everyone from our orthodox Daoism and would only focus on dealing with a few people. As long as the Incongruence Divine Mother was held back, no deterrence would be held against them.”</p><p>The Pure Lands and the Demon Race both resurfaced into the world at the same time. Among them, there might even be some experts concealing themselves. Even the Incongruence Divine Mother would have to be wary of them.</p><p>Currently, there were already bigwigs of the Grand Heavenly Immortal Realm battling in the war. No one could be certain if an expert in a higher realm exists among them.</p><p>“For our orthodox Daoism, our biggest protection is unstable,” said Yan Zhaoge softly. “Otherwise, the Great Calamity wouldn’t have happened.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
