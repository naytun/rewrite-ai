All present on the peak was panicked by the storms of nimbus.</p><p>“Now that Heaven Emperor is not present, I won’t attack you little guys. However, Illusory Coming Peak collapses today.”</p><p>With that, Yan Zhaoge came to the tip of the mountain with his hands clasped behind back.</p><p>All disciples of Heaven Emperor ran hysterically away for their lives as they all knew that whoever stayed would no doubt perish with the peak.</p><p>No one dared to trash talk and all tried desperately to get far away from Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>Trash talk for the moment would be making fool of themselves and even cost their lives.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge ignored all scattering disciples and came straight to the center of the Illusory Coming Peak, where stood a Daoist temple that Heaven Emperor used for cultivation.</p><p>Dispelling the defensive restriction, Yan walked in and straight to the backyard without paying any attention to anything along the way.</p><p>In the backyard stood a towering tree glistening pale green glow.</p><p>“Pity that it isn’t a pure ginseng fruit tree, but one grafted. No wonder the fruits don’t carry rich nimbus. Still, a great treasure.” Yan Zhaoge smiled and made a gesture of grabbing with his hand.</p><p>Then the towering tree was immediately pulled out by this invisible giant hand conjured by Yan. It seemed its exuberant roots had reached deep throughout the whole Illusory Coming Peak, but that didn’t stop Yan Zhaoge from ripping it out.</p><p>Then the giant Illusory Coming Peak began to crumble, violently.</p><p>And Yan Zhaoge’s last stamp accelerated the process of its destruction. The immortal peak that had been famous for years in Kunlun Mountain collapsed into ashes.</p><p>Standing far above the clouds, Wang Pu and Ah Hu saw the flying dusts in Kunlun Mountains and the place where Illusory Coming Peak stood caved down!</p><p>Holding on his palm the towering ancient tree that was thousands of times larger than his size, Yan Zhaoge casually walked in the air and out of the Kunlun Mountains to where Wang Pu and Ah Hu stood.</p><p>“Junior Brother Yan, I almost forgot your marvelous talents in formation,” said Wang Pu after managing a wry smile.</p><p>In fact, he didn’t forget it. Yan Zhaoge just demonstrated too many great talents in other aspects that his talent in formation was easily ignored by others.</p><p>A ninth level Martial Saint of Immortal Bridge defeated black-clothed Brocade Emperor with his overbearing mightiness.</p><p>A man of marvelous gifts and skills in forging artifacts and items.</p><p>And he alone ran the Heavenly Mysteries Pavilion that attracted the world’s attention by bringing many long-lost treasures back to the world.</p><p>Cultivation, artifacts and items forging all required much efforts, which most people could hardly achieve anything big in just one field. However, Yan Zhaoge excelled in almost everything that none other could.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge’s shocking achievements dimmed Wang Pu’s memory that Yan had slaughtered a group of Martial Saints of Immortal Bridge in The Nine Bends Yellow River Formation before he started Heavenly Mysteries Pavilion when he was still wondering in southeast and south with his cultivation at the Seeing Divinity stage.</p><p>Wang Pu had been thinking that Yan Zhaoge must have been too exhausted to take the cultivation of other aspects with such great achievements in both martial arts and artifacts forging. However, Wang Pu now realized that he was completely wrong.</p><p>“No, I didn’t think it wrong.” Wang Pu forced a smile, “It applies to everyone else, only not to Junior Brother Yan.”</p><p>“Senior Brother Wang, sorry to have kept you waiting,” smiled Yan Zhaoge with a simple nod. Then he turned to Ah Hu, “Please take this tree back to Eastern Vast Heaven Territory and hand it over to my father. He’ll handle this.”</p><p>Jade Capital Crag would surely get a share of the fruits, so Yan Zhaoge just saved the bother of asking Wang Pu.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge raised his hands and slowly drew his two hands together, contracting the towering ancient tree into a sapling. Two qi, black and white respectively, circulated around the sapling to prevent it from restoring to its previous size.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge then handed the sapling to Ah Hu.</p><p>“Young master, shall we drop a ‘visit’ to Qilin Cliff too?” Ah Hu asked after taking the sapling. Though he smiled quite honestly, his eyes beamed with obsession for treasures.</p><p>The corner of Wang Pu’s mouth twitched out of speechlessness.</p><p>“No, we don’t go to Qilin Cliff. Maybe next time.” Yan Zhaoge answered casually with a simple wave of his hand.</p><p>Wang Pu was relieved to hear the first half of Yan’s words but then was grieved by the latter half.</p><p>“But young master, Earthly Sovereign is not home, Concealed Sovereign in secluded cultivation, and Earthly Exalt killed by you outside Kunlun Mountian, so Qinlin Cliff is rudderless at the moment. An opportunity hard to get.” Ah Hu blurted out his confusion.</p><p>Wang Pu forced a wry smile, “As an adobe of a Profound Immortal, the grand guardian formation and protective restriction were set by the Earthly Sovereign himself, a Profound Immortal of tranquil level, which is mightier than that of Illusory Coming Peak. Even without anyone running the formation, Martial Saints like us are not able to crack it. Even if Earthly Sovereign perishes, the unattended formation still can run for at least a thousand years. Perhaps we may stand a chance by then.”</p><p>Ah Hu blinked his eyes for several times, looked at Wang Pu as if planning to say something but then refrained.</p><p>However, Wang Pu immediately got his unsaid meanings, “No, not even impossible with Origin Opening Sword. Unless someone who has pushed open Immortal Gate wields the sword.”</p><p>“Young master, what if you have ascended to Human Exalt?” whispered Ah Hu.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said casually, “You saw the sword light Martial Uncle Yue sent to us on the opening ceremony of Broad Creed Mountain?”</p><p>Ah Hu nodded repeatedly, “Yeah! It was so formidable and terrible that Heaven Emperor et al couldn’t even resist.”</p><p>“Uncle Yue didn’t even show his real skill,” Yan Zhaoge shrugged his shoulder. “Let’s presume that there is this martial saint who is extremely formidable, who, though unable to kill or hurt a true immortal that has successfully passed Immortal Mortal Tribulation, can fight the true immortal and make fun of him just like playing with a ball…So from what you can see, it is quite the same thing as a profound immortal fighting a true immortal?” Yan Zhaoge asked.</p><p>Ah Hu nodded repeatedly.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge continued, “However, this martial saint would have to suffer crushing defeat when facing any profound immortal.”</p><p>“Why?” Ah Hu couldn’t get it. He just scratched his head out of confusion.</p><p>“Because True Immortal is Leakless while Profound Immortal Tranquil.” Yan Zhaoge explained with a smile, “Leakless and Tranquil are the most visible difference between a True Immortal and a Profound Immortal, which has nothing to with the comprehension and practice of martial arts, nor with talents, aptitude or constitution, but with the natural laws of nature. If you couldn’t detach from it, you have to obey it. If you can detach yourself from it, then even a Profound Immortal is not your opponent.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
