Also, they seldom had the chance to meet Astro Sovereign.</p><p>Hearing that Astro Sovereign had come back, all the disciples in the Jade Sky Peak came to pay a visit to him, though they were still wondering where Female Emperor was.</p><p>However, since they were still under the Human Exalt Stage, none of them knew that Yan Zhaoge had been to the Immortal Court before.</p><p>Therefore, Astro Sovereign only brought that up now because Concealed Sovereign had mentioned that.</p><p>“Yes.” Yan Zhaoge nodded, “But due to some special reasons, I didn’t end up like Brocade Emperor’s daughter.”</p><p>Astro Sovereign frowned, “Special reasons?”</p><p>To answer Astro Sovereign’s question, Yan Zhaoge showed the Dim Radiant Wheel above his head. The light gleamed vaguely, which was hard to see clearly.</p><p>“Is this the leakless immortal weapon which Yin Tianxia tried to refine?” After glancing at the light, Astro Sovereign sensed the power of the Dim Radiant Twelve Arts inside and got enlightened right away.</p><p>“The last art of Yin Tianxia’s Dim Radiant Twelve Arts contains the peerless profound mysteries. But still, it can not prevent you from being harmed by Immeasurable Heavenly Lord.” Astro Sovereign pondered for a while before he continued, “So you mean…”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge nodded and said, “This immortal weapon wasn’t refined by me. But now it has already become part of me. Also, when I combined it with the peerless art of the Dim Radian Twelve Arts, it became even more effective.”</p><p>“I have discussed with Fu Ting about this. And it’s true that I never had a feeling that an invisible seed was planted deep in my mind like her.”</p><p>With Astro Sovereign’s eyebrows unwrinkled a bit, he also expressed his concern, “It doesn’t mean that nothing has happened to you.”</p><p>“I tend to take things as they come.” Yan Zhaoge said with a smile, “At least I didn’t feel anything wrong until now.”</p><p>“You still need to be careful and try not to make any contacts with the people from the external dao of the Immortal Court.” Astro Sovereign added, “When a cultivator of our Three Clear lineage meets the people of the external dao who are way more stronger than him, he could still be turned forcibly.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge nodded slightly, “Thanks for your warning, your majesty, I’ll pay attention to that.”</p><p>After bidding farewell to Astro Sovereign, Yan Zhaoge left the Restful Immortal Valley.</p><p>When he looked back, that huge glacier which had frozen the whole Land of tranquil stream reappeared in the Kunlun mountain again, freezing the whole area.</p><p>Meanwhile, lots of thought flashed in Yan Zhaoge’s mind.</p><p>His visit to the Restful Valley today solved many of his doubts. However, it also brought many questions to him.</p><p>As he had expected before, Concealed Sovereign was indeed not a person who only wanted to seclude himself and live a simply life.</p><p>What had happened to Astro Sovereign before did have something to do with Concealed Sovereign.</p><p>Moreover, Concealed Sovereign was also responsible for Brocade Emperor’s condition at that time.</p><p>All of these made Yan Zhaoge start to wonder if he could find answers to all of his puzzles from Concealed Sovereign.</p><p>For example, before he had discussed with his mother about the strangely shortage of the people like Si Kongqing in the World beyond Worlds. Actually, it truly was an abnormal phenomenon.</p><p>If Xue Chuqing hadn’t made any mistakes at that time, then there was only one explanation left.</p><p>Someone else had also been aware of the inside information and recruited the people like Si Kongqing secretly.</p><p>That meant that someone had been collecting the fragments of the Heavenly Essence Stone in the dark.</p><p>And was this person the one in the Restful Immortal Valley?</p><p>Although this thought seemed a bit hasty and was entirely groundless.</p><p>He couldn’t blame everything on Concealed Sovereign because the latter liked to do things sneakingly.</p><p>However, after thinking deeply, Yan Zhaoge still put great suspicions on this extremely powerful expert in the World beyond Worlds.</p><p>“I can’t be prejudiced by first impression. I haven’t seen the whole picture until now so I shouldn’t let anything influence my judgement.” Yan Zhaoge murmured that while shaking his head. Then he turned around and left.</p><p>Since he was in the Kunlun mountain, he went all the way north toward the Jade Capital Crag of the northern high peak.</p><p>As he met Wang Pu, Wang Pu couldn’t help but say emotionally, “Junior apprentice-brother Yan, should I say you are infinitely powerful or extremely lucky. I can’t believe you really have brought Astro Sovereign back to the World beyond Worlds.”</p><p>“I’m flattered, senior apprentice-brother Wang. I just felt I got lucky this time.” Yan Zhaoge smacked his lips and continued, “But the news I have brought back aren’t all the good ones. We are far from being well at ease.”</p><p>“Have you heard anything from Senior apprentice-uncle Yue?”</p><p>Wang Pu answered with a stern look, “I was about to tell you. My master finally sent back a message shortly before.”</p><p>“Really?” Yan Zhaoge got cheered up, asking, “So, what did he say?”</p><p>“Not too much. He only mentioned that he had already known about the thing with Earthly Exalt.” Wang Pu responded seriously, “He also pointed that he was in the middle of something so he couldn’t come back from the outer space in a short period of time.”</p><p>“However, he also referred that Earthly Sovereign might not be able to come back either. Thus we don’t need to worry about the Qilin Cliff for the moment. Instead, we need to pay more attention to the Restful Immortal Valley.”</p><p>Suddenly, something occurred to Yan Zhaoge’s mind.</p><p>He reminded of the thing Gao Xuebo had told him about when he had been in the Roving Jade Heavens.</p><p>Although it hadn’t been proved yet and nobody knew about the truth, it seemed that something wrong had already happened in the Immortal Court.</p><p>According what Wang Pu had said about Yue Zhenbei’s message, Yan Zhaoge was more certain that the information he had got from the Roving Jade Heavens might be true.</p><p>Because Wang Pu hadn’t reached the Martial Saint Realm, Sword Sovereign only sent him a rather obscure message.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge made a speculation that when Sword Sovereign said that he was in the middle something, it must be related to the Immortal Court.</p><p>At present, Yan Zhaoge already heard many secret stories from Xue Chuqing and Astro Sovereign.</p><p>For example, now he knew that most of the time, the three sovereigns and the five emperors didn’t stay very long in the World beyond Worlds.</p><p>And, once they left the World beyond Worlds, it might take them a long time to come back. Sometimes, it would take a few years. Sometimes, it might take a dozens of years or even longer.</p><p>Except from exploring the outer space, they had put lots of efforts in doing another thing, which was joining the battles between the Immortal Court and the blessed lands of Buddhism from time to time and helped the former.</p><p>The people in the Worlds beyond Worlds had a better relationship with the external dao of the Immortal Court when compared to the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor and his followers or the people from the Roving Jade Heavens.</p><p>There was a rumor that even the North Star Emperor has got into the fight.</p><p>Of course, that only happened in rare situations.</p><p>Even if there was no tension between the World beyond Worlds and the Immortal Court, North Star Emperor still needed to guard against Immeasurable Heavenly Lord all the time.</p><p>Sometimes, Yan Zhaoge felt that this might be the deepest and darkest secret of the World beyond Worlds.</p><p>However, he also believed that the people like Earthly Sovereign were also capable of gaining profits for the World beyond Worlds during this process.</p><p>As a result, both parties took precautions against each other while cooperating with each other at the same time. There never lacked of prying or spying along the way.</p><p>For thousands of years, even a long epic was not able to write down all the things that had happened in the dark.</p><p>‘But, what has happened in the Immortal Court that even Senior apprentice-uncle Yue and Earthly Sovereign are entangled there?’ Yan Zhaoge pondered.</p><p>After all, Earthly Sovereign and Sword Sovereign never belonged to the Immortal Court.</p><p>So maybe they had taken the initiative to offer their help, but the Immortal Court wouldn’t force them to stay and deal with the chaos.</p><p>“Unless…” Yan Zhaoge stroked his chin, saying, “The chaos wasn’t started by the blessed lands of the Buddhism, but was related to the Three Clear lineage.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
