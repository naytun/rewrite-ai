But she doesn’t know where the Exalted Wood Luminary is either.”</p><p>“However, I’ve heard from my mother that the Exalted Wood Luminary seemed to have a good relationship with the Exalted Solar Luminary and the Exalted Lunar Luminary in the past.”</p><p>“It might be hard for you to find fellow Daoist Shao.” Astro Sovereign shook his head, saying, “There are so many people who have tried to find her during the past thousands of years. But no one has got any clue of her trace. At that time…”</p><p>Having paused for a moment, Astro Sovereign continued, “She has gone missing until now after she was badly injured. Nobody has heard from her ever since.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge suddenly wanted to give out a wry smile.</p><p>The woman who was called ‘fellow Daoist Shao’ by Astro Sovereign was the Exalted Wood Luminary of the new Nine Luminaries of Kunlun. She was also the Great Grand Master of Xue Chuqing, the Master of the Bright Connection Emperor Hu Yuexin.</p><p>Her name was Shao Junhuang.</p><p>She was one of the three female experts of the new Nine Luminaries of Kunlun who had created the World beyond Worlds. Also, her wide range of knowledge was rare among the nine luminaries.</p><p>After the Great Calamity, though few of the Daoism experts of every sect had managed to escape from the disaster and survived until now, there were still lots of legacies and treasures being lost.</p><p>The people of the young generations tried their best to restore those unique skills, treasures or the mysterious arts.</p><p>The people of the young generations tried their best to restore those unique skills, treasures or the mysterious arts. Yet that was bound to be a tough and long process.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge set up the Heavenly Mysteries Pavilion and made many lost treasures reappear in the worlds, which astonished the World beyond Worlds.</p><p>In fact, before the Heavenly Mysteries Pavilion was set up, lots of valuable treasures and mysterious arts in the World beyond Worlds had been restored through the investigation and hard work of Shao Junhuang, the Exalted Wood Luminary.</p><p>Her missing had made her investigations be laid aside. And there were so many people who felt deeply sorry for that.</p><p>It was only after Yan Zhaoge’s Heavenly Mysteries Pavilion had been created that all the investigations about the treasures and arts began to be carried forward again.</p><p>What’s more, Shao Junhuang’s investigation was not restricted to the area of the rare and valuable treasures.</p><p>She was also the master of formation and alchemy in the new Nine Luminaries of Kunlun.</p><p>Tons of formation maps and the elixir prescriptions which had been restored by her benefited the people in the World beyond Worlds a lot until today.</p><p>It was worth mentioning that Shao Junhuang’s alchemy skill was acknowledged to be the best among the new Nine Luminaries of Kunlun. She was also the best elixir experts among the Daoism experts after the Great Calamity.</p><p>The reason why Xue Chuqing, Yan Zhaoge’s mother, was able to make so many achievements on formation and other various skills was because of those knowledge foundations of her Great Grand Master.</p><p>Xue Chuqing’s master and her Grand Master Hu Yuexin were all strong performers in these aspects, thanks to the knowledge they had learned.</p><p>However, since Shao Junhuang had gone missing so early, she hadn’t had the chance to teach Hu Yuexin all her skills.</p><p>Xue Chuqing, on the other hand, had shown an excellent talent on the formation, which sometimes made people feel that her Great Grand Master’s skill was finally restored.</p><p>Unfortunately, after hearing Astro Sovereign’s words, Yan Zhaoge realized that the Exalted Wood Luminary might already be dead.</p><p>“As for fellow Daoist Gao, I thought that he had hidden in the underworlds. But you just said that he had escaped.” Astro Sovereign continued, “It seems that he has his own plans. If I guessed correctly, he must have paid close attention to the situation of the World beyond Worlds.”</p><p>“Once he knows about what happened, he would definitely get involved without your request. However, I don’t know what he will do.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge nodded in silence.</p><p>Actually, Mars Halberd had said the same thing as Astro Sovereign about Gao Han, the Exalted Solar Luminary.</p><p>Their comments about Gao Han were largely identical except slight differences.</p><p>“And fellow Daoist Ling…” Surprisingly, Astro Sovereign hesitated for a moment, and then said, “She’s close to fellow Daoist Gao. However, no one knows what she has been thinking due to her tendency of being alone.”</p><p>Then there was a figure appearing in Yan Zhaoge’s mind.</p><p>It was an instinct figure which he couldn’t even see the appearance.</p><p>However, Yan Zhaoge still had a deep impression of this figure.</p><p>That was the woman who had left the Extreme Yin Crown at the Eight Extremities World.</p><p>She was also one of the new Nine Luminaries of Kunlun, the Exalted Lunar Luminary.</p><p>Ling Qing, the third female expert in the new Nine Luminaries besides Shao Junhuang, the Exalted Wood Luminary and Jian Shunhua, the Exalted Rahu Luminary.</p><p>“Although fellow Daoist Shao holds the same position with fellow Daoist Gao and fellow Daoist Ling about the development of Daoism, they are not that close to each other.” Astro Sovereign shook his head, saying, “In fact, fellow Daoist Shao and fellow Daoist Jiang have the closest relationship among us.”</p><p>“Although she holds different views with fellow Daoist Jiang about the developments of the Daoism, she always treated him with half-apprentice manner in those days.”</p><p>Jiang Shen, the Earthly Sovereign, who used to be the Exalted Earth Luminary, was the oldest one in the new Nine Luminaries of Kunlun who had survived the Great Calamity.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge nodded while ruminating.</p><p>It was not rare to see two people disagree with each other on the major issues while still on good terms.</p><p>Nevertheless, if the disagreements escalated, they were bound to separate from each other, regardless of their friendship.</p><p>“You know about the stories of fellow Daoist Jiang. And Xingtang have suffered from the catastrophe. But there is still another one who has deep connections with fellow Daoist Shao,” Astro Sovereign said that slowly.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge then asked, “The Exalted Fire Luminary?”</p><p>“That’s right.” Astro Sovereign replied, “However, I’m not so certain about the relationship between them.”</p><p>“But I’m pretty sure that he has been looking for fellow Daoist Shao persistently for all these years.”</p><p>“I can’t say if it’s because of their grudge or something else.”</p><p>Astro Sovereign looked at Yan Zhaoge and added, “However, this might be a feasible way for you, compared to asking fellow Daoist Gao or fellow Daoist Ling.”</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Yan Zhaoge decided not to mention his mother’s Area Latitude Formation. Instead, he asked, “The space is boundless. Even the Exalted Fire Luminary has disappeared for more than thousands of years. Your majesty, do you know how can I reach him?”</p><p>“Not really.” Astro Sovereign answered, “But I have a clue. You might have a try.”</p><p>Then Yan Zhaoge asked tentatively, “The Mars Halberd?”</p><p>“No, not exactly. But it does have something to do with him.” Astro Sovereign smiled and said, “It’s their hometown.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge was stunned by the words of Astro Sovereign, he asked, “Their… Their…their homeland?”</p><p>“Yes, they are both half human and half dragon.” With wistful expression on his face, Astro Sovereign said, “I guess you already knew that Mars Halberd is the demonic soul which was sealed in a weapon.”</p><p>“He cannot be considered as a demon, half demon more accurately. And perhaps that’s the reason why he was bullied very often in his race. And he hated the dragon race because of that.”</p><p>“Even after he had sealed himself in a weapon due to the fatal attack, he still wanted to slaughter all the dragons. And at last he was sealed in the ancient cold abyss.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge touched his chins while saying, “It sounds like the Exalted Fire Luminary was not hostile to the dragon race?”</p><p>“Not like the Mars Halberd does.” Astro Sovereign nodded.</p><p>“Hometown?” With his eyes squinted, Yan Zhaoge muttered.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
