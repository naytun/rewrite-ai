After a while, he simply shook his head.</p><p>Since things had already been decided, there was no further need for him to do battle with Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>Daoist Oneheaven had perished, and whether Xue Chuqing was alive or not, Yan Di was already there now.</p><p>Even if Wang Zhengcheng gave chase, he had no confidence of being able to do anything when facing Yan Di’s sabre.</p><p>As for the black-clothed Brocade Emperor, besides that previous agreement, it was also because he himself wished to comprehend the Taiyi Fist of Grand Simplicity through clashing with Yan Zhaoge that he had lent his aid.</p><p>Therefore, the black-clothed Brocade Emperor would only battle against Yan Zhaoge this time as he would not partake in a battle against anyone else.</p><p>Wang Zhengcheng’s greatest regret right now was that his battle method earlier had really been too conservative!</p><p>He had prioritised stability too much when intercepting Yan Di earlier.</p><p>Heaven Opening countered Grand Simplicity. As compared to Chen Qianhua who had not made use of his Immortal Artifact throughout, bolstered by the Yin Yang Earth Mountain River Diagram, Wang Zhengcheng’s Yin Yang Earth Heaven Breaking Hammer could instead pose a threat to Yan Di.</p><p>He had sought only to entangle and delay his opponent in a one versus one fight as there had indeed also been fewer chances for him to attack.</p><p>After the Upper Exalt Chen Qianhua had arrived, the most suitable method would actually have been for him to focus on attack and Chen Qianhua to focus on defence, the two joining forces to deal with Yan Di.</p><p>While it was not easy for Chen Qianhua’s foundation of the world to block Yan Di’s sabre, the various defensive martial arts executed together would allow him some leeway to defend against him. In the meantime, Wang Zhengcheng could have launched an attack on Yan Di.</p><p>Sadly, however, Wang Zhengcheng had been much too conservative.</p><p>Also, his understanding of Chen Qianhua was insufficient as he had really never expected that he would not use his Immortal Artifact, the Heavenly Heart Ruler, at all as he had simply turned and walked off in the end.</p><p>Following his observation of this battle, Wang Zhengcheng felt that Chen Qianhua would probably not have minded joining forces with him to attack Yan Di together.</p><p>Now that he understood this, Wang Zhengcheng was only able to regret it.</p><p>There was already nothing he could do now regardless of whatever came to mind.</p><p>The black-clothed Brocade Emperor’s thoughts circulated as he had already understood the situation and what Wang Zhengcheng intended.</p><p>He was momentarily caught by indecision as he pondered on what to do.</p><p>Now, a powerful light suddenly surged from the distant World beyond Worlds!</p><p>Close to where the three were battling, sword-light surged into the skies from the World beyond Worlds, breaking straight through its dimensional boundaries and arriving at extradimensional space where they currently were.</p><p>Sensing that towering sword-intent, a brilliant glow erupted from the eyes of the black-clothed Brocade Emperor and Wang Zhengcheng.</p><p>A sword-light that seemed able to cleave through space and bring a brand new world into existence surged out from the World beyond Worlds.</p><p>Where the sword-light passed, one world after another was born within that space of nothingness.</p><p>Numerous mini pocket dimensions that resembled air bubbles appeared amidst illusory space, forming a line that soon arrived before the trio.</p><p>These pocket dimensions were all still extremely primordial and crude but had already taken fledgling form.</p><p>If enough time passed, they would come to possess laws of their own, projecting life along with mountains, lakes and rivers.</p><p>While this was Yan Zhaoge’s first time witnessing that sword-light, he too knew its origins.</p><p>It was none other than the sword previously used by the Sword Sovereign Yue Zhenbei, the Origin Opening Sword that was an Immortal Artifact of the Leakless level!</p><p>Wang Pu had indeed delivered the sword to Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>The black-clothed Brocade Emperor’s figure swiftly sank as he shot towards the incoming sword-light, seeking to intercept it before it arrived.</p><p>Without needing any prior communication whatsoever, the Earth Exalt Wang Zhengcheng moved to block Yan Zhaoge even as he did so.</p><p>The spiritual force of the Yin Yang Earth Mountain River Diagram was unleashed to the maximum limit which Wang Zhengcheng could currently exert.</p><p>Numerous layers of Yin Yang Earth Spirit Soil congregated, transforming into an endless chain of mountains.</p><p>At first glance, it was as if the entire Kunlun Mountain had been shifted from the World beyond Worlds to this region of space.</p><p>Their previous exchange had already allowed them to sufficiently witness Yan Zhaoge’s strength.</p><p>If they were to allow the Origin Opening Sword to fall into Yan Zhaoge’s hands, it would definitely rise to an incomparably terrifying level.</p><p>While Yan Zhaoge was not of Jade Capital Crag’s lineage and was seeing the Origin Opening Sword for the first time, with his cultivation base and attainments in the sword, things would be terrible for the black-clothed Brocade Emperor and Wang Zhengcheng if it arrived in his hands.</p><p>The Origin Opening Sword had to be intercepted!</p><p>If they could temporarily wrest the Origin Opening Sword, even if they could not use it themselves, it would still be better than if Yan Zhaoge obtained it.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge too had descended immediately after seeing the sword-light of the Origin Opening Sword as he moved to receive it.</p><p>Facing the obstruction of Wang Zhengcheng, Yan Zhaoge did not try to evade him.</p><p>The dazzling purple light of thunder instead erupted from within his pupils.</p><p>An Instant’s Thunder!</p><p>All light instantly dimmed amidst space.</p><p>There were only those shocking heavenly thunderbolts that mightily erupted at that instant!</p><p>Yan Zhaoge was surrounded entirely by thunderbolts as he transformed into a streak of thunder-light, mightily smashing downwards and penetrating through the vast earth that obstructed him!</p><p>The radiant beam of light did not cease in its momentum as it went after the black-clothed Brocade Emperor in hot pursuit.</p><p>The black-clothed Brocade Emperor continued onwards, expanding the Grand Beginning Bright Emptiness Form and shifting through space as he was first to arrive beside the Origin Opening Sword.</p><p>Relying on his Leakless body of a True Immortal, he intended to forcibly receive Yan Zhaoge’s attack while continuing to reach out to grab the Origin Opening Sword.</p><p>Still, red light flickered within Yan Zhaoge’s eyes as he secretly circulated the profundities of the Immortal Trapping Sword Manual and instantly arrived beside the black-clothed Brocade Emperor.</p><p>Next, he smashed down with a mighty Cyclic Heavenly Seal, sending the latter flying backwards!</p><p>Yan Zhaoge stabilised his form and stood in mid-air, performing a grabbing motion.</p><p>A rustic sword that was pure white and flickered with a faint golden light fell into his palm.</p><p>Seeing that Yan Zhaoge had obtained the Origin Opening Sword, the black-clothed Brocade Emperor did not hesitate whatsoever as his figure flickered and he fled at once!</p><p>As Yan Zhaoge slowly brandished this sword, space before him was torn into half wherever his sword-light passed.</p><p>“Eat another of my swords, black-clothed Brocade Emperor.”</p><p>An azure dragon of unprecedented proportions pursued the black-clothed Brocade Emperor amidst extradimensional space.</p><p>Partway through the chase, blood suddenly spurted out from the body of the azure dragon, a baleful, ferocious air shocking the heavens as space was suffused with an endless glow of blood!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
