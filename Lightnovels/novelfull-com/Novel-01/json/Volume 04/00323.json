With her straightforwardness, it was such that her gender would sometimes even be overlooked.</p><p>It was only the matter of the Extreme Yin Bout that would bring Feng Yunsheng into a state of seriousness as soon as it was brought up.</p><p>The bones of this girl who had cast life and death aside actually sought extremely to win.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said, “The views of the outside world can just be ignored. As for some voices within the clan, you also do not have to care about them.”</p><p>Hearing his words, Feng Yunsheng smiled, “Actually, they’re not completely baseless.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge blinked.</p><p>Broad Creed Mountain was actually internally divided somewhat regarding Feng Yunsheng.</p><p>Especially with Feng Yunsheng entitled to a large amount of the clan’s resources as a Maiden of Extreme Yin.</p><p>Everyone knew the importance of Maidens of Extreme Yin. They also all knew that winning the Extreme Yin Bout and the Extreme Yin Crown along with it was not an easy thing.</p><p>However, some people were inevitably wary of Feng Yunsheng, originating from the Sacred Sun Clan.</p><p>Now was still fine. If in the long term, Feng Yunsheng did not show any tangible results in the Extreme Yin Bouts, the internal pressure of the clan on her would far exceed that from outside the clan.</p><p>“We should spend our effort on grooming our own Maiden of Extreme Yin.”</p><p>Such words had vaguely spread.</p><p>The reason for this was a piece of news brought back by the former East Sea’s First Seat Elder, Chang Zhen.</p><p>Just recently, in the East Sea, Chang Zhen had found a Maiden of Extreme Yin!</p><p>This girl had originally had a Master, but that Master had died to the Flame Devils, with her being rescued by martial practitioners of Broad Creed Mountain.</p><p>Chang Zhen had originally not thought anything of it, but had inadvertently discovered that this girl actually had the rare Extreme Yin Physique.</p><p>As the news spread, the entire Broad Creed Mountain was joyfully surprised. After having experienced that great tribulation, with Yuan Zhengfeng having Transcended Mortality and entered Sainthood, Broad Creed Mountain had now gained another Maiden of Extreme Yin. This led to much more joy within the clan.</p><p>Having earlier been dispatched to the East Sea as Chang Zhen’s replacement, Fu Enshu directly took her on as a female disciple.</p><p>While in name, this girl was still an ordinary disciple of the clan, still required to pass through numerous tests before she could become a direct disciple, taking on Fu Enshu as her Master, her special trait of being a Maiden of Extreme Yin let no one doubt this.</p><p>Amidst the congratulations, such voices had resounded.</p><p>As some saw it, this new disciple whose background was much simpler fit Broad Creed Mountain’s needs more.</p><p>Of course, this was from a long term perspective.</p><p>Currently, even Feng Yunsheng had to chase after the leaders diligently, let alone this one who had only just begun.</p><p>Currently, there were only an extreme few who thought this, being unable to stir up anything at all.</p><p>However, if Feng Yunsheng did not perform well in the next few Extreme Yin Bouts, while the other’s potential and talent was greater, more people’s hearts would inevitably be shaken.</p><p>In this time’s great tribulation of Broad Creed Mountain, Feng Yunsheng had not feared entering the depths of the Devilish Domain Grand Formation despite the great danger. This had proven her sense of belonging towards Broad Creed Mountain.</p><p>At the end of the day, Feng Yunsheng still needed to prove herself a step further.</p><p>As a former Sacred Sun Clan disciple come under Broad Creed Mountain, she would inevitably be appraised by even stricter standards.</p><p>Looking at Yan Zhaoge, Feng Yunsheng smiled, “The clan has given you a mission? After this time’s Extreme Yin Bout, you should also have to go over to Master’s by the East Sea, checking on that newly entered junior apprentice-sister a step further, looking at how the potential and talent of her Extreme Yin Physique is, grooming her like in my case if she can be developed.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge shrugged, “Able to have double layers of insurance is a good thing, just like how the Sacred Sun Clan simultaneously groomed you and Meng Wan in the past.”</p><p>“Still, it is already hard for you who lost two years. With her who’s even more behind, unless her talent crushes yours and Meng Wan’s, her hopes of victory aren’t great.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said, “I will treat both of you equally, but the thoughts of those people in the clan are really too naïve.”</p><p>Feng Yunsheng smiled, “Participating in the Extreme Yin Bout is not merely for interaction through sparring. It is for the final victory, the obtaining of the Extreme Yin Crown. If that junior apprentice-sister really is stronger than me, it is also only right for the clan to pour more resources over to her.”</p><p>She raised her brows slightly, “Still, one also shouldn’t think of me as that weak ah.”</p><p>Amidst the raising of her brows, it was as though a sabre had been unsheathed as she returned to her usual domineering form.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge purposefully smiled, “In this time’s Extreme Yin Bout, if you are not at the very bottom, I would already be satisfied.”</p><p>Feng Yunsheng did not dispute this, instead laughing, “According to your usual sayings, we aren’t strongly aiming for this time’s Extreme Yin Bout?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge nodded leisurely, “That’s right, and that’s why you can relax your mind.”</p><p>“We are right about to arrive. Having come this time, Zhaoge, pay more attention to evaluating the Maidens of Extreme Yin of the other clans,” The bigwig of Broad Creed Mountain who had brought Yan Zhaoge and Feng Yunsheng along to attend the Extreme Yin Bout this time was the past First Seat Elder of the Earth Domain, Elder Meng, who had returned to the clan after handing over his responsibilities.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge answered, “Rest easy, Elder Meng. I understand.”</p><p>Led by Elder Meng, they arrived at the Lake Domain.</p><p>If not for the major disaster at Clear Concealed Lake back then, the fifth Extreme Yin Bout, like the previous Heavenly Connection Meet, would very possibly have been held there.</p><p>Now, however, it had been changed to where Turbid Wave Pavilion itself was located.</p><p>Gazing far into the distance, a vast lake appeared before their eyes, the never-ending lake broad as the sea, even more massive than Clear Concealed Lake had been, the lakes in Lianhu County of the Heaven Domain’s Central Heaven Region being like a small witch encountering a big witch when compared to this place.</p><p>Entering the Lake Domain, nearing Turbid Wave Pavilion, experts of Turbid Wave Pavilion naturally emerged to receive them.</p><p>Along with them were also younger disciples of Turbid Wave Pavilion, including an old acquaintance of Yan Zhaoge’s, the direct disciple of Turbid Wave Pavilion Xie Youchan.</p><p>After exchanging their greetings, Yan Zhaoge and the others followed their arrived hosts.</p><p>As they walked, Yan Zhaoge heard Xie Youchan’s secret sound transmission, “The Sacred Sun Clan has dispatched two Maidens of Extreme Yin this time, participating in the Extreme Yin Bout together.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
