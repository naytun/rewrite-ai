The set targets had all been completed, and there had also been additional gains.</p><p>However, there had been some difficulties within.</p><p>When fiddling around over at the Ice Pith Vein, he had inadvertently been discovered by a remnant of Black Nightmare Mountain, Zheng Shuo, also having drawn over a bunch of people of the Heavenly Thunder Hall.</p><p>While at the end of the day, the overall situation had not been affected by this, with Yan Zhaoge even having killed more than half of his enemies over in the ice cave, he had still left witnesses behind.</p><p>This way, the news of him having triggered the Ice Pith Vein would inevitably reach the ears of the Sacred Sun Clan.</p><p>With the Southern Underground Palace being a sacred ground valued highly by the Sacred Sun Clan, something having cropped up with it, it would definitely be investigated into carefully.</p><p>While it appeared to have occurred without any prior warning whatsoever, it would not be have been hard to tell that it had been caused by a change in the earth vein.</p><p>The drying up of the Heavenly Ice Spring of the Snowy Immortal Palace was one of the most legendary stories that had been passed down to this day. Currently, the number of people of the Eight Extremities World who knew this were not few.</p><p>While it appeared unrelated on the surface, if one broadened their scope a little, they might even be able to link the two incidents together.</p><p>That way, the spearhead would naturally point towards himself.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge stroked his lower chin, “The ice cave has been completely cleansed by the eruption of the Ice Pith Vein, and definitely no evidence has been left behind, but…haha, no evidence has to be spoken of between the Sacred Sun Clan and I, isn’t it.”</p><p>As compared to the Heavenly Thunder Hall, the Sacred Sun Clan would probably wish to get rid of him even more.</p><p>“Let’s all just see whose abilities are the greater,” Yan Zhaoge chortled, his gaze turning cold.</p><p>From the moment they had trampled their way onto Broad Creed Mountain, they had already become sworn, fated, irrevocable enemies.</p><p>Accompanied by Song Chao, Yan Zhaoge’s group walked on the land of East Dragon Island.</p><p>East Dragon Island was vast in size. Only having walked a long way did Yan Zhaoge, Song Chao and the others finally arrive at Jade Sea City at its centre.</p><p>While this was really the first time Yan Zhaoge had truly stepped into Jade Sea City, he also possessed some prior understanding of the place.</p><p>Jade Sea City was divided into an inner city and an outer city, the outer city resembling a true city, being the core region of East Dragon Island, its political as well as economic centre.</p><p>Here was the greatest area for the transaction of goods on the East Sea, with various people of all kinds congregated here.</p><p>Other than martial practitioners, there were also ordinary citizens.</p><p>Meanwhile, it was the inner city that was the true Jade Sea City in the meaning of the term, that Sacred Ground of the Eight Extremities World, the ruler of the Water Domain.</p><p>The disciples of Jade Sea City mostly lived and cultivated within the inner city. The vital regions of Jade Sea City also lay within this inner city.</p><p>Sikong Qing looked rather curiously at the various colourful sights as well as different kinds of people of the outer city.</p><p>While she had heard of it before, witnessing it personally for the first time, it still clashed somewhat with her known experience.</p><p>Ignoring the first and second-rate powers, near the headquarters of the other Sacred Grounds or in their vicinity, there would also be a high population density area as crowds of people would naturally be drawn over to settle down. However, where the Sacred Grounds had been established themselves tended to be rather more quiet and peaceful.</p><p>Around Broad Creed Mountain, many cities existed on the territory of the Central Heaven Region. However, Broad Creed Mountain’s eight peaks, from head to toe, were limited to the entry of only disciples of Broad Creed Mountain.</p><p>The Sacred Sun Clan’s World Illuminating Peak didn’t even have to be mentioned. There, no ordinary people were allowed to set foot within its surrounding hundred kilometres.</p><p>Infinite Boundless Mountain had been established at the main peak of the Infinite Boundless Mountain Range, extending tens of thousands of kilometres into the distance. Elsewhere within aside, in the region close to the main peak, not even a hunter or a fisherman was to be found.</p><p>Turbid Wave Pavilion was quiet and elegant, but its main island at the middle of the lake was similarly a solitary island, only its disciples allowed there. The surroundings consisted of lakes and villages atop water all around.</p><p>The location of the Heavenly Thunder Hall was full of thunderstorms all year round, not approached by people.</p><p>On one hand, it was that the locations of the various Sacred Grounds were all rare places where dense spiritual qi was congregated, suited for martial practitioners to cultivate in peace.</p><p>In order to sustain the environment and the spiritual qi flow of these areas for the long term, all the Sacred Grounds would reduce the movements of normal citizens in the vicinity of where they were located.</p><p>On the other hand, it was to keep outsiders away.</p><p>When their disciples moved about the outside world, it was fine for them to be close to the people, but the clans themselves would retain a sense of mystery, with this often being very beneficial towards gathering people’s hearts and intimidating the first and second-rate powers to be subservient to their rule.</p><p>Comparatively speaking, Jade Sea City was a deviant from this rule.</p><p>As Yan Zhaoge and the others traversed the streets, Song Chao said, “Your clan has an Elder Feng and a Junior Brother Feng here. They just happen to be within the City as well.”</p><p>“Oh?” Yan Zhaoge was slightly taken aback, “Senior apprentice-uncle Feng and junior apprentice-brother Feng are here as well?”</p><p>Following by Yan Zhaoge’s side, Ah Hu also blinked.</p><p>This Elder Feng was named Feng Chi, also a Broad Creed Mountain martial practitioner. All along, he had been exceptionally close to Yan Zhaoge’s father Yan Di.</p><p>His son, Feng Moyang, was similarly aged to Yan Zhaoge. The two could be considered to have entered the clan, began cultivating in martial arts as well as grown up together.</p><p>Feng Chi, alongside the King of the Eastern Tang Kingdom Zhao Shicheng as well as Elder Jun Zhiyuan of the Howling Wind Sword Sect, could all be considered to be as close as family with the family of Yan Zhaoge and Yan Di.</p><p>Feng Chi and Feng Moyang were both rather proficient in the dao of alchemy. Earlier, they had been searching for medicines beyond the seas, having been away from the clan for many years.</p><p>Currently, they actually just happened to be in Jade Sea City as well. Yan Zhaoge had indeed been unaware of this beforehand.</p><p>Song Chao said, “That’s right. I heard that they just happened to pass by here on the way back to the Heaven Domain, therefore staying here for a while, looking around the city and searching for some medicinal ingredients.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge nodded, “Mmm, we have not met for a long time; I should pay them a visit soon.”</p><p>Since he had come to Jade Sea City, with Yan Zhaoge’s current position and status, it was only right that he meet with Jade Sea City’s Lord, Song Wuliang. After all, he was no longer an ordinary member of the younger generation.</p><p>However, Jade Sea City’s response was that Song Wuliang was currently in seclusion.</p><p>“That’s too bad then,” Yan Zhaoge smiled as he said.</p><p>A Jade Sea City Elder before him was similarly all smiles as he stroked his long beard, “Before entering secluded cultivation, the City Lord said that you, Zhaoge, are truly remarkable, making a trip to the Extreme Northern Snowy Plains and causing the Heavenly Thunder Hall to be so flustered and wounded.”</p><p>“If Zhaoge has nothing to do, why don’t you reside within our Jade Sea City for a few more days. Our City Lord would also very much like to meet you.”</p><p>While he had not met Song Wuliang, other than Song Chao, this Jade Sea City Elder had personally come to the door of Jade Sea City’s inner city to meet him. This gave Yan Zhaoge ample face.</p><p>This Elder was the External Affairs First Seat Elder of Jade Sea City, a late Essence Talisman Martial Grandmaster expert at the ninth level of the Martial Grandmaster realm.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge smiled, “City Lord Song is polite. I indeed intend to remain here for a period of time, but I don’t know if I will still be here when City Lord Song emerges from seclusion.”</p><p>As they conversed, Jade Sea City’s side brought Yan Zhaoge’s group along in proceeding to their pre-arranged lodgings.</p><p>After Yan Zhaoge and the others had been settled, just a short time later, a youth had already arrived on their doorstep.</p><p>“I was still saying that I would go and meet senior apprentice-uncle Feng immediately, and here you are,” Seeing that youth, Yan Zhaoge smiled at him.</p><p>That youth was Yan Zhaoge’s junior apprentice-brother Feng Moyang, his appearance proper and his bearing warm and mature.</p><p>Seeing Yan Zhaoge, he too smiled, “My father is currently concocting a pill, and will only be leaving seclusion at least a week later. I heard that you, senior apprentice-brother Yan, have come, so I came over first.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge replied, “You’re just in time. I just happen to have something that I need your and senior apprentice-uncle Feng’s help with.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
