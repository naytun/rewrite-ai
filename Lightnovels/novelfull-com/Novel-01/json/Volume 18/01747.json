Yan Zhaoge shook his head with a smile and sat back in his chair.</p><p>He raised his hand and swiped horizontally, summoning four items: a vase bottle, a brocade handkerchief, a lotus pedestal, and a lamp.</p><p>Of course, the blessing dew was stored in the vase bottle.</p><p>On the other hand, the brocade handkerchief warped the two Ginseng Fruits.</p><p>Although the lotus pedestal was broken, a faint nine-colored brilliance was still exuding from it.</p><p>Lastly, the lamp contained the Earlier Heaven Essence of Departed Fire, which was like the ancestor of all fire. Its crimson gold kindle kept bouncing actively.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge leaned back in the chair, looking at the four gifts floating mid-air. His eyes were slightly absent-minded, seemingly occupied in thoughts.</p><p>Then, he spun the bamboo slip brought by the Grand Saint of Nine Spirits in his hands playfully.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge was soon to get married, with many guests attending. Of course, the guests came to the ceremony with an ulterior motive. However, they had met the etiquette.</p><p>Many hints clouded his mind. He had to decipher the information provided critically.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge decided to disclose certain matters to Feng Yunsheng, Yan Di, and Yang Jian. However, there were pieces of information he had to decipher alone.</p><p>Time passed unknowingly. When Yan Zhaoge came back to his senses, he realized it was already the next day.</p><p>“The time has come?” Yan Zhaoge laughed and shook his head, “This is my first marriage of three lifetimes.”</p><p>He stood up and swiped his palms horizontally in the air again. The vase bottle, the brocade handkerchief, the lotus pedestal, and the lamp floating in the air were put away.</p><p>Immediately after, the door of the main hall opened. Yan Di and Xue Chuqing appeared at the door.</p><p>“It’s a big day. Even though our custom isn’t too complicated like the mortals’ family, we still have many things to prepare.” Xue Chuqing looked at Yan Zhaoge emotionally, “You should get ready early.”</p><p>Yan Di’s eyes became tender as he assessed Yan Zhaoge up and down, but he did not make a sound; he stood there and listened to his wife talking.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I got it.” Yan Zhaoge stepped forward with a smile and brought them out of the hall together.</p><p>In the palace group decorated with lanterns and colorful lights, hordes of Broad Creed Mountain disciples attended the festive place at this moment, making the place happening and filled with joy.</p><p>Xu Fei arranged for someone to stay behind to handle the internal affairs of Broad Creed Mountain. At the same time, he and Xie Youchan came to this new world specifically to attend the wedding of Yan Zhaoge and Feng Yunsheng.</p><p>Shi Jun and his mother, Ying Yuzhen, would naturally not be absent. Needless to say, the relationship between their family and the Yan family was close. Back then, it was Yan Zhaoge’s group who reunited the mother and son and helped them to escape from the devil.</p><p>Earlier, Yan Zhaoge went to Everlasting Oath Heaven to check on the place. Ying Longtu knew about his marriage to Feng Yunsheng and immediately urged Yan Zhaoge to find a way to save him from working on his task for a few days so that he could also come to watch the ceremony.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge naturally would not refuse his request on this occasion. Speaking of which, Ying Longtu and Shi Jun had grown up along with him and Feng Yunsheng.</p><p>The world was ever-changing. Even after many ups and downs, many acquaintances were still with him. Of course, Yan Zhaoge was quite relieved and gratified with it.</p><p>He let his North Ocean Clone replace Ying Longtu’s task in watching over the Earlier Heaven World and Everlasting Oath Heaven. Ying Longtu, who had gotten a break time, cheered and rushed back to Zhuluo Royal Reed Heavens. In recent days, he had been busy with Yan Zhaoge’s wedding. He was much more dedicated than being the Earlier Heaven World’s “master”.</p><p>On the other hand, Xia Guang had acquired a notice about it from his disciples during his seclusion. He interrupted his progress halfway through to attend the weddings of Yan Zhaoge and Feng Yunsheng.</p><p>Yan Di, Xu Fei, and even Yan Zhaoge had all reprimanded Xia Guang, but he didn’t care.</p><p>This Broad Creed Lineage’s hot-tempered cultivator had actually broken into a smile and brushed it off without retorting back.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge was amused by it, but he also felt a sense of warmth in his heart.</p><p>The majority of Broad Creed Mountain’s disciples had rushed over, except for a few who had to stay behind and could not leave their posts without permission. After all, it was the ceremony in passing down the sect to the next master, aside from its nature being a grand occasion.</p><p>As a matter of fact, the Brood Creed Sect was still in need of manpower.</p><p>In addition to Broad Creed Mountain’s own family, the number of visitors from the rest of the world was enormous.</p><p>Even the Xue Chuqqing’s Bright Connection Valley lineage had sent people over to help them with the ceremony.</p><p>In Zhuluo Royal Reed Heavens, at Sky beyond Skies, almost all those who had the ability to cross the cosmos space attended the wedding ceremony.</p><p>Jade Capital Crag, Ingenious Flying Peak’s Red Lotus Cliff, Golden Court Mountain, Green Sky Mountain, Grave Thunder Palace, Cloud Pavilion Mountain, Profound Remnant Locale, Phoenix Ritual Mountain, Wutong Slope, and many more.</p><p>Yue Zhenbei, Fu Yunchi, Cao Jie, Liu Zhenggu and others all led the team in person.</p><p>Feng Yunsheng’s close friend, Guan Yuluo, was from the Cloud Pavilion Mountain Profound Remnant Locale’s lineage. Of course, she would attend Feng Yunsheng’s wedding this time, along with Zeng Mo, who was currently in charge of the Profound Remnant Locale.</p><p>The Phoenix Ritual Mountain Wutong Slope lineage, which had been developing silently and low-key for hundreds of years, had finally recovered its vitality.</p><p>However, facing Yan Zhaoge and Broad Creed Mountain, they had no ill intention. This time, they came respectfully to congratulate them.</p><p>Even after excluding Yan Zhaoge, who established the Zhuluo Royal Reed Heavens, and Feng Yunsheng at Grand Heavenly Realm, the Broad Creed Mountain Sect was already the undisputed master of Zhuluo Royal Reed Heavens.</p><p>All in all, Yan Zhaoge and Broad Creed Mountain were the critical anchors for the entire Daoism lineage. Their influence had long gone beyond Sky beyond Skies and Zhuluo Royal Reed Heavens.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge’s wedding was a hard-to-come-by occasion. Even the Jade Sky Peak Cold Wave Locale, which was in seclusion for many years and rarely communicated with the outside world, had sent people over to celebrate it.</p><p>Hundreds of years had passed. Chen Xuanzong, Jie Mingkong, and Chu Lili were still frozen. The Jade Sky Peak Cold Wave Locale had lost its backbone, but Yan Zhaoge, Yue Zhenbei, and others have never forgotten this place, taking care and nurturing the sect from time to time.</p><p>Although Jade Sky Peak Cold Wave Locale was low-key, it had been developing silently in recent years. Outstanding young successors continue to emerge, but they were reclusive and rarely left their base.</p><p>They would ignore all other things and events, but not when Yan Zhaoge and Feng Yunsheng are getting married. Cold Wave Locale would not want to sit out from this. The current sect leader left the mountain and brought generous gifts to congratulate the newlyweds.</p><p>In addition to Sky beyond Skies, Tong Xinlin, Guang Tongzi, Daoist Fen Yu, and others in Jade Spring Skies also brought their sect members to congratulate them.</p><p>In addition to Zhuluo Royal Reed Heavens, those from the other Daoism universes also went to Zhuluo Royal Reed Heavens to congratulate the couple after getting the news.</p><p>Needless to say, Gao Qingxuan, Long Xingquan, Yu Ye, Long Xueji, and others in Roving Jade Heavens of the Crimson Luminance Melding Solaris Heavens came as well.</p><p>Even the North Star Emperor at Grand Sovereign Apricot Great Heaven and the Cloudy Firmament Fairy of the Unperturbed Origin River Heaven had dedicated people to the wedding.</p><p>Cloudy Firmament Fairy was still in charge of the Immortal Extermination Formation, so she couldn’t come in person. Still, she commanded her disciples to bring gifts to congratulate Yan Zhaoge and his wife.</p><p>Xiao Ai was directed to the work of collecting and counting the gifts. She made sure that she skimmed over all the treasure and every gift when the item didn’t go through her hands. Of course, that made her happy so much so that her smile hid her eyes.</p><p>“Thank you, Cloudy Firmament Lady, for the generous gift.” Xiao Ai smiled and accepted the gift.</p><p>Find out what happens next by getting early access to chapters with Patreon!
