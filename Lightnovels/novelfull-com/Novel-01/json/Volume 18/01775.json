Soon, he returned to the Nine Underworlds with Eastern Sovereign Taiyi.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge looked up at the green lotus and the ancient bell and then looked at the Supreme Elder Lord in the sea of blood. Then, thoughts came into his mind, “Although no one can guess the Supreme Elder Lord’s mind, Amitabha and Eastern Sovereign Taiyi should have pieces of clue.”</p><p>When they left the Nine Underworld previously, it seemed like they gave Nine Underworlds a chance. However, it was also possible that they were also betting on the Supreme Elder Lord making a move in the end.</p><p>As a result, when Nine Underworlds lost the gamble, Amitabha and Eastern Sovereign Taiyi won.</p><p>So things had developed to this point. For them, the Nine Underworlds still had the chance to salvage the situation.</p><p>The Daoist in the Immortal Extermination Formation disappeared.</p><p>Incongruence Divine Mother and Cloudy Firmament Lady took over the Immortal Extermination Formation simultaneously. They drove the formation away and stopped clashing with the Twelve Devilish Gods Formation.</p><p>The monstrous sword qi had dissipated. The Immortal Extermination Formation returned to the endless void and gradually disappeared.</p><p>Now that the other four Dao Ancestors had regained a balance of power and would no longer fight each other to death, Daoism would naturally have to be careful.</p><p>The Supreme Elder Lord was still in the sea of blood. If the Immortal Extermination Formation were still occupied here, the outcome would be terrible if the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord or Future Buddha went to the Daoism’s universe.</p><p>It was also possible for the Primordial Heavenly Devil, Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil, and several Dao Ancestors to reach a new compromise. They might join forces to break the Immortal Extermination Formation.</p><p>As long as the devil was willing to give up the birth of the Doomsday Heavenly Devil and give up the Twelve Devilish Gods Formation, there were many possibilities.</p><p>Since the Elder Lord had participated, it gave the leeway for the Immortal Extermination Formation to withdraw and maintain its deterrence to the other forces, primarily the Dao Ancestor heretics.</p><p>The Daoism’s universe without the Supreme Elder Lord and Immortal Extermination Formation was an easier target for the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord than the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus with the Future Buddha garrisoned.</p><p>Future Buddha might be in a sorry state, but it could be a facade to lure unsuspecting people, for example, illuminating Daoism’s universe to replenish his forces.</p><p>The situation was changing rapidly, and unexpected changes might occur at any time.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge’s group had to be more careful.</p><p>The Immortal Extermination Formation disappeared, while the green lotus and ancient bell reappeared. The Supreme Elder Lord in the sea of blood noticed, but he was still unfazed, continuing his fight against the Primordial Heavenly Devil and the Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil.</p><p>Although he had retrieved One Qi Manifesting Three Clears for the time being, the Black Skies Yellow Earth Exquisite Tower above his head was still tyrannical, making it difficult for the two Devil Ancestors in front of him.</p><p>However, the Twelve Devilish Gods Formation was more robust than before.</p><p>The entire Nine Underworlds turned into a boundless sea of blood. Along with the surging tides, the aura of doomsday gushed out and eroded the surrounding world.</p><p>The phantom began to solidify on the pillar that symbolized Doomsday Heavenly Devil.</p><p>Despite this, the Primordial Heavenly Devil and the Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil would not dare to relax.</p><p>The green lotus and the ancient bell descended into the sea of blood together.</p><p>Amitabha and Eastern Sovereign Taiyi manifested their true form, appearing under the sea of blood. The operation of the Twelve Devilish Gods Formation became stagnant again.</p><p>The surging blood was no longer fierce.</p><p>“Fellow Dao Brother, I haven’t seen you for many years. How have you been?” Amitabha and Eastern Sovereign Taiyi bowed their heads to the Supreme Elder Lord.</p><p>The Elder Lord smiled and said, “I’m doing fine.”</p><p>The three Dao Ancestors of Daoism, demon races, and Buddhism stood in the sea of blood, shaking the entire devil formation once again.</p><p>Although things were going terribly, the Primordial Heavenly Devil and the Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil did not intend to give up so easily.</p><p>Several Dao Ancestors fought immediately in the sea of blood.</p><p>The situation seemed to have returned to the time when Amitabha and Eastern Sovereign Taiyi joined forces to descend into the sea of blood. Time seemed to have gone through a cycle.</p><p>Future Buddha stopped being too close to the Nine Underworlds this time, so he could advance and retreat a lot more freely. On the other hand, the Elder Lord remained in the sea of blood, with Immortal Extermination Formation readied but not released, deterring the external forces.</p><p>Even if Nine Underworlds tried to cooperate with the Amitabha to defeat Eastern Sovereign Taiyi again, it would be challenging for the plan to take effect like last time.</p><p>If the Elder Lord was not here, the Nine Underworlds could try to exchange their opponents with Amitabha from time to time.</p><p>That would be having Amitabha occupy Supreme Elder Lord while the Nine Underworlds focus on dealing with the Eastern Sovereign Taiyi.</p><p>After all, Amitabha and Eastern Sovereign Taiyi eyed for the transcendence slot of this era.</p><p>While erasing the Maitreya Buddha that affected him, the other and the more direct way was undoubtedly to kill the Eastern Sovereign Taiyi!</p><p>However, such opportunities were more challenging to get.</p><p>For example, the Nine Underworlds concentrated on defeating Eastern Sovereign Taiyi, but Amitabha might not be able to occupy the Supreme Elder Lord.</p><p>Of course, the Elder Lord might not be able to defeat Amitabha. However, as long as he incarnated the Black Skies Yellow Earth Exquisite Tower, Amitabha could only watch helplessly as the Elder Lord assisted Eastern Sovereign Taiyi.</p><p>Primordial Heavenly Devil and Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil didn’t utter a word. Instead, they relied on their geographical advantage and fought with the other three Dao Ancestors.</p><p>Twelve Devilish Gods Formation was incomplete after all. Under the current circumstances, it was greatly affected.</p><p>The blood-colored tides began to subside and returned to the Nine Underworlds.</p><p>Even the monstrous blood qi gradually dissipated. Finally, the Nine Underworlds reappeared in its pitch dark scene.</p><p>The sea of blood had a lower tide, gradually returning to the bottom of the Nine Underworlds.</p><p>The mysterious spirit patterns composed of twelve strokes also dimmed at this time.</p><p>The eyes of everyone, who the blood light had trapped previously, flickered faintly.</p><p>The Nine Underworlds were suppressed again. The chance for Archaic Dipankara Buddha, Dao Monarch Lu Ya, Bhikkhu Xuan Du, and the others had come once again.</p><p>Find out what happens next by getting early access to chapters with Patreon!
