Thinking back on this now, he could not help but smile as he just shook his head repeatedly.</p><p>Sitting beside the Southeastern Exalt Cao Jie, the Northeastern Exalt Liu Zhenggu felt rather emotional too, “This old man was originally just going to act once on behalf of Bright Connection Hu’s descendant to give myself peace of mind. I really never thought that things might actually turn out like this.”</p><p>“I recall Yan Zhaoge when I first met him. Back then, he had yet to develop. However, within a mere span of merely around ten years, he already has the ability to stir the winds and the rains within the World beyond Worlds.”</p><p>Liu Zhenggu said admiringly, “Such a youth is hard to come by indeed. It is the same for his father.”</p><p>Cao Jie looked slightly out of sorts with a rather complex expression on his face as he thought of what Yan Zhaoge had previously told him.</p><p>“To be honest, I took a trip to the lands of the Immortal Court and already know some things.”</p><p>Remembering this, Cao Jie felt it to be regretful indeed.</p><p>The more outstanding Yan Zhaoge was, the more he felt this to be a real pity.</p><p>Looking at Bai Tao and Wang Pu’s lot by the side, Cao Jie sighed inwardly, “I only hope that the Sword Sovereign can think of a solution.”</p><p>As compared to the Female Emperor, Cao Jie and Wang Pu etcetera, it was another thing that the other guests were feeling.</p><p>Bai Ziming who had had dealings with Yan Zhaoge before and hailed from the Floating Gate World, having afterwards become a guest Elder at Golden Court Mountain, felt especially emotional at this moment.</p><p>In but around a mere decade, Broad Creed Mountain had already become a massive entity whose strength even surpassed that of Golden Court Mountain.</p><p>Those who had felt that it was undeserving of the name of the East Peak of Daoism in the past were actually gradually beginning to feel that it might just have come to be somewhat deserving of it.</p><p>Meanwhile, he, Bai Ziming, was still affiliated to and reliant on Golden Court Mountain.</p><p>While both hailed from a lower world, the difference between them was really as wide as that between the heavens and the earth.</p><p>The Heavy Sun Sect was clearly still the number one power over in the Floating Gate World as it was backed by experts in the World beyond Worlds too. Still, facing a small, rebuilt Towering Wave Pavilion, they still had to show them much respect, not daring to slight them in the least.</p><p>The reason for this was none other than the fact that Yan Di’s Master, the former Chief of Broad Creed Mountain Yuan Zhengfeng, had some close ties with Towering Wave Pavilion, even having entered a conflict with the Heavy Sun Sect over this before.</p><p>Due to Broad Creed Mountain, Towering Wave Pavilion was virtually like a grand ole monarch in the Floating Gate World right now.</p><p>While the Heavy Sun Sect did not like feeling so helpless, the problem was that even without Yan Zhaoge and Yan Di making a move, just Yuan Zhengfeng who currently already stood at the peak of Seeing Divinity Martial Saints and could ascend the Immortal Bridge at any moment was sufficient to sweep through the Heavy Sun Sect of the World beyond Worlds.</p><p>Great Snowy Mountain that Bai Ziming hailed from naturally had no need to do so. Still, watching all this, they felt undecipherable emotions that were hard to express.</p><p>Learning about Yan Di’s origins now, Bai Ziming felt no envy or jealousy as he instead felt much more able to accept things than before.</p><p>Just thinking about this, Bai Ziming could not help but smile wryly.</p><p>Pavilion Lord Gu Hong of the North Sea Sword Pavilion was seated alongside Chief Zhou Haosheng of the Dim Darkness Sect.</p><p>Both of them represented local powers of the Royal Reed Sea who had experienced the great tribulation brought about by Shen Lingzi back then and survived to tell the tale.</p><p>The heavens of the Royal Reed Sea had changed as they gained a new hegemon.</p><p>They were of no mind to resist at all like when the Grand Xuan Dynasty had claimed hegemony over the Royal Reed Sea back then.</p><p>This was not because Yan Zhaoge and Broad Creed Mountain had always been on pretty good terms with them.</p><p>Instead, it was because the current Broad Creed Mountain was just too much stronger than the Grand Xuan Dynasty of the past.</p><p>With the gap between them having surpassed a certain level, the other powers of the Royal Reed Sea instead lost all interest in resisting as they simply obediently acted with Broad Creed Mountain acting as their spiritual supreme leader.</p><p>Just thinking about how the Radiant Light Sect and Copper Men Island that had resisted the Grand Xuan Dynasty with them that year were already no more, the two inevitably felt rather emotional.</p><p>Zhou Haosheng and the other Dim Darkness Sect martial practitioners felt especially intense emotions over how the Radiant Light Sect which originated from the same source as them, once their longtime enemy, now no longer existed.</p><p>“Forgive this Gu for being nosy, but I think it would be best if Chief Zhou just accepts things as they are with the Dim Radiant Wheel,” Gu Hong kindly sent to Zhou Haosheng via sound transmission.</p><p>Zhou Haosheng smiled wryly, “You overthink things, Pavilion Lord Gu. First not mentioning the reminder of Golden Court Mountain that obtaining the Dim Radiant Wheel would actually be a calamity rather than fortune, even if this old man was adamant, how would I have any chance?”</p><p>He sighed, “It is good enough that our Dim Darkness Sect survived that great tribulation. Now, this old man simply wants to pass down the legacy of our ancestors in the hopes that we will be able to develop and grow strong in the future.”</p><p>“The Royal Reed Sea is too small to contain Broad Creed Mountain.”</p><p>Hearing these words, Gu Hong nodded emphatically in agreement.</p><p>Gazing at the soon-to-be disciples of Broad Creed Mountain who had passed the tests and entered the great hall, he sighed, “They are widely accepting talents today.”</p><p>The two exchanged glances, actually both thinking of the same thing.</p><p>While this was the first time Broad Creed Mountain was accepting disciples in order to replenish its lack of manpower, their tests had still been strict and involving all areas.</p><p>Those who failed to pass these tests still might have the potential to develop into powerful experts.</p><p>Many representatives of the other powers who had come to Broad Creed Mountain this time were planning to metaphorically pick up the scraps.</p><p>Being located in close proximity and thus more easily benefiting, the North Sea Sword Pavilion and the Dim Darkness Sect would naturally not give up on such a chance.</p><p>Despite this sect which had only arrived in the World beyond Worlds over a decade ago rising over their heads to preside over them, Gu Hong and Zhou Haosheng were feeling very calm right now.</p><p>Even without today’s battle, they had already long since been convinced by the various miraculous achievements of Yan Zhaoge and Broad Creed Mountain over the years.</p><p>Besides accepting new disciples and gaining new blood in their opening ceremony this time, there was also an internal reshuffle within Broad Creed Mountain.</p><p>Those of the elder generation gradually began giving up their positions as they entered secluded cultivation and diligently focused on cultivating.</p><p>The roles of First Seat Elders of the sect’s vital departments were already gradually increasingly coming to be taken up by their third generation disciples who had already grown up.</p><p>Those of the younger generation of the past were gradually coming to take centre stage.</p><p>Some of those who were stationed outside gradually began to display signs of Broad Creed Mountain’s ever-increasing momentum.</p><p>This was something that many people were concerned about as they thus attempted to deduce Broad Creed Mountain’s prospective developmental plans.</p><p>Still, what people paid most attention to was the fact that Yan Zhaoge who was already the most important, central figure of Broad Creed Mountain despite his youth did not assume any position in Broad Creed Mountain.</p><p>While this was somewhat unexpected, it seemed to be reasonable too.</p><p>While Yan Zhaoge was not assuming any position, no one would doubt the fact that his voice held the greatest weight in Broad Creed Mountain.</p><p>Not assuming any position entailed that he would be free to continue cultivating or move freely about outside for longer periods of time.</p><p>Whichever it would be, others would still pay attention to it nevertheless.</p><p>Everyone could not help but guess: what would this youth who stirred up the winds and rains of the World beyond Worlds do next?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
