The pattern it had was different from the one on Shi Jun’s head.</p><p>Still, from both of these emanated a strange, ominous devilish qi.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge and the others observed the sigils silently as they waited patiently.</p><p>After a while, the lustre on the surface of the ice sculpture gradually vanished as the sigils on the foreheads of Shi Jun and Ying Yuzhen temporarily disappeared too.</p><p>“I regret to say that I too cannot see through the specifics,” The Female Emperor’s voice resounded.</p><p>Hearing this, Yan Zhaoge’s eyes lit up slightly, “Even True Immortals cannot see through its foundation. A great Devil that can possess such methods would naturally be extraordinary. As a result, the search radius for the suspects has decreased yet further.”</p><p>The Female Emperor had evidently come to the same conclusion, “Before the Great Calamity, both Daoist and Buddhism frequently exterminated devils. Many great Devils of the Nine Underworlds were brought to an end by them.”</p><p>“During the Great Calamity, the Nine Underworlds was affected too, suffering tragic casualties.”</p><p>While Devils would be reborn after they died as they were said to be undying and inextinguishable, there were no absolutes in this world as it was not like they could not be extinguished for good.</p><p>“The great Devils currently still active in the Nine Underworlds are limited in number,” The Female Emperor said slowly, “Still, this does not eliminate the possibility of some devils having executed schemes before being extinguished so that they would still have a chance of reviving afterwards.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge nodded slightly.</p><p>This was actually his initial guess which had finally been verified now.</p><p>It was just that he did not know which mighty figure the mechanisms left behind on Shi Jun and Ying Yuzhen originated from.</p><p>Yan Di looked at Nie Jingshen, Bao Tao and Wang Pu, “Shi Jun and his mother are descendants of my late senior apprentice-brother. Now that he is no longer around, I must naturally take good care of them.”</p><p>“When senior apprentice-brother Yue has returned from extradimensional space, we may have to bother him to take a look too.”</p><p>Bai Tao said, “Senior apprentice-uncle Yan is a loyal, righteous person who values relationships greatly. I believe that Master will understand.”</p><p>After a painstaking millennium, the Sword Sovereign Zhen Yuebei himself too was taking care of the sole remaining bloodline of his late Master.</p><p>“Also, since the matter concerns the Nine Underworlds, Master will definitely not let down his guard so easily,” Bai Tao elaborated, “Even if it was unrelated to you, senior apprentice-uncle Yan, he would still concern himself with this matter. After all, this involves great Devils of the Nine Underworlds that could also be extremely powerful.”</p><p>Wang Pu said, “Please keep this matter from spreading further before Master’s return if you can.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge, Yan Di and those of Broad Creed Mountain slowly nodded.</p><p>“I hope that this little brother here and your mother can return to Kunlun Mountain’s Northern High Peak with us if possible,” Bai Tao said, “No one can know when the great Devil’s sigil might activate.”</p><p>Back at Kunlun Mountain, before the Sword Sovereign’s return, the Female Emperor would still be nearby to help them out in the off chance that something happened.</p><p>If even the Female Emperor could not do anything, they would have no choice but to request the help of the Concealed Sovereign who was constantly stationed in seclusion at Kunlun Mountain.</p><p>Yan Di said, “I’m afraid that not only would this be troublesome for Jade Capital Crag, you would have to bear a risk too.”</p><p>“It is fine,” Wang Pu shook his head, “If calamity really struck, the possibility of quelling it would be much higher at Kunlun Mountain than in the southeastern Yang Heaven Territory. With the Female Emperor and maybe even the Concealed Sovereign making a move, the damage caused would thus be greatly reduced too.”</p><p>Yan Di considered this for a moment before cupping his hands towards them, “Since that is so, I will be troubling you.”</p><p>Bai Tao’s trio hastily said that this it was no trouble at all. The Female Emperor who was sealed in ice said nothing as she was clearly giving her tacit consent.</p><p>Shi Jun felt rather reluctant to part with his sect despite what had been said.</p><p>Still, thinking that this was for the good of he and his mother, he said nothing as he abided by these arrangements.</p><p>After the matter of Shi Jun and Ying Yuzhen had been decided on, this conversation drew to a close.</p><p>Still, afterwards, Yan Zhaoge and Yan Di paid a special visit to the guest lodgings and looked for the Southeastern Exalt Cao Jie in private.</p><p>As soon as Cao Jie saw them, he knew what they had come for.</p><p>“We have come for the matter of my mother this time. Please tell us what you know, Southeastern Exalt,” Yan Zhaoge cut to the chase.</p><p>Cao Jie glanced at Yan Di, “Yes, while you have yet to attain the Human Exalt stage, being protected by the Grand Simplicity Splendour Cloud, there should be no problem for you. You, however…”</p><p>Looking at Yan Zhaoge, he could not help but sigh.</p><p>“I am deeply moved by the Southeastern Exalt’s concern,” Yan Zhaoge smiled, “Still, maybe it is due to the Dim Radiant Wheel, or maybe it is due to the last of the Dim Radiant Twelve Arts, the art of peerless infinity, but although I journeyed to the Immortal Court and also learnt the name of the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord there, there are no abnormalities at all which have overcome me.”</p><p>“It should not to be the extent where I would be illuminated and converted just like that, the treasured-light of the power of faith being born within me.”</p><p>Cao Jie was rather taken aback by this, “Those experts of the Dim Radiant Sect who were proficient in the Dim Radiant Twelve Arts and beneath the Human Exalt stage that year were all unable to resist it. Not yet having become a Immortal Artifact, the Dim Radiant Wheel is this effectual?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said, “I cannot say this for sure. Still, is that Immortal Court and the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord really so miraculous?”</p><p>“Merely learning of the name of the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord, a shadow would be left behind within our hearts as he would be able to illuminate and convert us?”</p><p>“In the tens of millennia that the Future Buddha has existed, I have never heard of such domineering methods.”</p><p>From Yan Zhaoge’s previous interactions with Cao Jie, the latter already knew that he did also know about the current blessed lands of Buddhism. Thus, he was not surprised to hear the Future Buddha being mentioned.</p><p>In reply to Yan Zhaoge’s query, Cao Jie said slowly, “If not for this, the World beyond Worlds would not have had to ban news of the Immortal Court from circulating just as we would guard against a venomous snake.”</p><p>“It is actually also because of the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord and the Immortal Court that the news on Buddhism was restricted by us.”</p><p>“The Immortal Court and the blessed lands have many conflicts. While they are sworn enemies, they are actually the same kind intrinsically. Therefore, we restricted all the information regarding them.”</p><p>Cao Jie raised his head slightly, saying, “As for why the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord possesses this miraculous ability, I could not know.”</p><p>Yan Di asked, “When I came to know Chuqing that year, let alone a Human Exalt, she was still far from even the Martial Saint realm. In that case, she…”</p><p>“Her situation is unique,” Cao Jie said, “There is a supreme treasure descended in her lineage which can ensure that she is not illuminated despite knowing of the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord.”</p><p>Yan Di raised his brows lightly, “Oh, such a treasure must be very rare indeed.”</p><p>“Half the River Diagram!” Cao Jie nodded in agreement.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge put a hand to his head, “It is no wonder then.”</p><p>The Yellow River and Nine Halls diagrams were supreme treasures of legend which had left countless tales behind.</p><p>It was just that they had already vanished from sight for many years even before the Great Calamity.</p><p>He had not thought that his mother might actually possess half the Yellow River diagram.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge nodded quietly, “My mother…or should I say the late Dim Radiant Emperor and my mother’s Master, the Bright Connection Emperor-what exactly happened between them and the Immortal Court?”</p><p>“Long story,” Cao Jie had a rather complex expression on his face, “Essentially, it is all regarding a single object.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
