Are you feeling happy?” Yan Zhaoge gazed towards the depths.</p><p>A figure floated amidst roiling, dark devilish qi.</p><p>While he was not affected by the devilish qi, he appeared to be in a rather dishevelled, harried state.</p><p>His arms that had forcibly withstood Yan Zhaoge’s Cyclic Heavenly Seal earlier were a shredded mess of flesh and blood as they were strange and distorted.</p><p>His pale skin looked totally devoid of blood.</p><p>Chen Qianhua had just opened his mouth to speak when fresh blood leaked from the corners of his mouth, causing him to cough.</p><p>“Cough…cough…cough…you…you couldn’t be simultaneously cultivating in the Three Purities, right? Cough, cough…otherwise, it would be impossible for you to already have comprehended the reversal of creation and a reversion to earlier heaven times at the Martial Saint realm.”</p><p>Despite coughing blood non-stop, Chen Qianhua had a joyful expression on his face, “Really, really, cough, cough…I’ve discovered that you are much more interesting than the Brocade Emperor!”</p><p>Amidst his words, his arms that were a mangled bunch of flesh and blood twitched unceasingly as they swiftly healed at a speed that was visible to the naked eye.</p><p>The colour of blood gradually began appearing on his face that had previously been pale as paper.</p><p>A powerful vitality surged.</p><p>Time that resembled water circulated.</p><p>Interwoven space turned illusory.</p><p>Wide, boundless phenomena were manifested.</p><p>Yin and yang flowed at equilibrium.</p><p>Changeable, fickle mind rippled.</p><p>The six concepts of yin-yang, time, space, life, matter and mind simultaneously manifested, collectively forming the foundation of the world.</p><p>Beneath this profound force, the injuries inflicted by Yan Zhaoge quickly healed.</p><p>Glancing at Chen Qianhua, Yan Zhaoge raised his brows lightly, “Oh, you have gathered the full Later Heaven Six Scriptures of the Primordial Heavenly Scriptures of the Jade Clear lineage?”</p><p>“The thoughts of the Exalted Solar Luminary are truly difficult to predict. He too is an interesting person,” While Chen Qianhua’s aura was still weak, he finally ceased coughing blood.</p><p>A streak of green light flew from him, growing amidst the air as it instantly transformed into a banner.</p><p>A surging vitality manifested as the concepts birthed from the five elements were infinite and endless.</p><p>This green banner fell towards the deep abyss of the Earth Domain, intercepting the Extreme Yang Seal in mid-air.</p><p>The tyrannical Extreme Yang Seal that resembled the descent of a great sun was actually swept up by that banner and rendered temporarily unable to descend.</p><p>No longer being suppressed by the Extreme Yang Seal, the Nine Underworlds devilish qi within the Earth Domain became active as it rampaged once more.</p><p>Looking at that green banner, Yan Zhaoge’s gaze hardened as he was finally somewhat taken aback, “Oh, isn’t this the Grand Longevity Banner? It was actually in your possession?”</p><p>The Grand Longevity Banner was a weapon that had been forged by the Exalted Wood Luminary of the Kunlun Nine Luminaries, being acclaimed alongside the Extreme Yang Seal and the Extreme Yin Crown.</p><p>The reason Yan Zhaoge was concerned about it was that his mother, Xue Chuqing, was none other than the true orthodox descendant of the Exalted Wood Luminary!</p><p>If the information supplied by Liu Zhenggu, Cao Jie, Wang Pu and the others was right, the Bright Connection Emperor Hu Yuexin had been the sole disciple of the Exalted Wood Luminary.</p><p>“You think that it should be in your mother’s possession?” Chen Qianhua shook his head, “That should originally have been the case. Still, it was first passed down to the disciple of the Bright Connection Emperor, that is your mother’s Master. Still, she died, with the Grand Longevity Banner thus not being passed down to your mother.”</p><p>“I obtained it from somebody else. I do not really need to use it anywhere, but I have simply kept it nonetheless.”</p><p>Chen Qianhua smiled, “It looks like my patience has been rewarded. It has come to be of use today, and in an interaction with you too. It really could not be any more perfect.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge looked at him, his lips slowly curling into a smile too, “Yes, wonderful indeed.”</p><p>He ignored the devilish qi down below that was rampaging once again, ignored the Extreme Yang Seal that was entangled with the Grand Longevity Banner.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge simply struck out with another palm, aiming straight for Chen Qianhua!</p><p>At the same time, a streak of light flickered in the distance, a massive silhouette suddenly appearing in the air above the Earth Domain.</p><p>The Kunpeng soared through an endless distance, instantly arriving before them.</p><p>As the silhouette of the Kunpeng faded, it was the figure of Yan Zhaoge’s Northern Ocean Clone that appeared.</p><p>The Northern Ocean Clone raised a dark green bamboo cane that was seven feet long and had seven segments, bringing it down full circle and smashing it towards the Grand Longevity Banner!</p><p>Struck by the dark green bamboo cane, the green light on the surface of the Grand Longevity Banner instantly shook.</p><p>Under usual circumstances, the bamboo cane would have to be eight feet long with eight segments for it to be able to deal with miraculous weapons like the Grand Longevity Banner and the Extreme Yang Seal.</p><p>Still, Chen Qianhua had to fully concentrate on battling against Yan Zhaoge as his control of the Grand Longevity Banner weakened.</p><p>As the Grand Longevity Banner was also clashing with the Extreme Yang Seal that was no inferior to it in the least, it was immediately unable to bear it as it suffered a blow from the dark green bamboo cane now.</p><p>The Grand Longevity Banner weakened as the Extreme Yang Seal gained the upper hand, not only suppressing the Grand Longevity Banner as it even continued suppressing the rampant Nine Underworlds devilish qi down below.</p><p>“I must offer you a word of praise. You have indeed brought me quite a pleasant surprise,” Yan Zhaoge chuckled, his palm encompassing the heavens and earth as it arrived above Chen Qianhua’s head.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
