Then, he looked at the black hole again.</p><p>The light from the Lofty Prestige Mirror was gradually losing its hold over the black hole.</p><p>Having lost Yuan Zhengfeng’s and Fang Zhun’s intentional interference, the entrance of the black hole gradually began to close.</p><p>The infinite chaotic spatial flows presented a scene that was chaotic beyond belief. Yuan Zhengfeng’s figure gradually grew distant within, vanishing slowly from sight.</p><p>The old man was not tall, was maybe even a little small and thin. However, he had always been towering and magnificent as he truly resembled the centre of the heavens and the earth at this moment.</p><p>Standing within the air, supporting Fang Zhun’s body with his true essence, Yan Zhaoge bowed solemnly to Yuan Zhengfeng, vanishing within the black hole.</p><p>Ever maintaining that bowing posture, Yan Zhaoge said softly, “Grand Master, you must take good care of yourself. We will definitely meet again.”</p><p>With a sweep of his palm, his true essence surged, enveloping the little remaining blood mist on Fang Zhun’s body before keeping it well.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge inhaled deeply, looking at his second apprentice-uncle once more.</p><p>Checking it with his true essence, Yan Zhaoge could feel that Fang Zhun was indeed in an extremely terrible state.</p><p>Having sacrificed his essence blood and will to form a sword, Fang Zhun had suffered a great loss to his vitality, nearly having perished as a result.</p><p>Yuan Zhengfeng had spoken true. Even having escaped the fate of being devoured by the black hole, the current Fang Zhun might also possibly die at any time.</p><p>The reason Yuan Zhengfeng had drawn on all his might to send Fang Zhun out was actually that he hoped against hope that Yan Zhaoge and the others might have a way to save him.</p><p>He especially hoped that Yan Zhaoge, present at the scene, would be able to immediately give him effective emergency treatment.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge did not disappoint Yuan Zhengfeng. He took out six long, thin golden needles from his Shadow Shrinking Pouch, wielding them like the wind as he quickly inserted them within six of Fang Zhun’s great acupoints.</p><p>Afterwards, he unceasingly infused his true essence within Fang Zhun’s body.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge’s current true essence was extremely abundant, just having yet to be further refined. It was naturally more than sufficient to stabilise Fang Zhun’s condition now.</p><p>At the same time, another nine golden needles fell within Yan Zhaoge’s hands. He wielded them once more, leaving all the golden needles in Fang Zhun’s body, not removing them.</p><p>Finally, Yan Zhaoge brought his palms together, the Clear Qi Robe enveloping Fang Zhun’s body once more.</p><p>A thread of gold extended from each of the fifteen golden needles, connecting to the Clear Qi Robe as they guided numerous streams of clear qi towards boosting Fang Zhun’s condition.</p><p>Only carefully observing and seeing some colour having finally returned to his second apprentice-uncle’s pale face did Yan Zhaoge finally sigh in relief.</p><p>“His condition has temporarily stabilised such that it will not deteriorate. However, a long time will still be needed before he can recover completely. Second apprentice-uncle cannot leave the care of the Clear Qi Robe. He will require its continuous protection.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge let out a long breath, the spiritual light behind his head vanishing.</p><p>Looking at the deep abyss around him, while black fog still shrouded the area, it had already regained its former, usual appearance.</p><p>Even while it was still a land of death, the Nine Underworlds baleful qi and the terrifying devilish qi in the surroundings had finally faded greatly.</p><p>Looking downwards, after having re-sealed the Great Nine Underworlds Door, the massive golden talisman was already gradually vanishing, disappearing within the black fog once more.</p><p>The fierce, bloodied battle by him, his Grand Master and the others had not been for naught.</p><p>Bar any unforeseen circumstances, this seal would again be able to persist for a very long time.</p><p>Here, Yan Zhaoge knit his brows slightly, turning to look at that great golden seal within the air.</p><p>First not mentioning the fact that this seal had suppressed the area for so many years without breaking, just the fact that a fist-intent incarnation left behind by the original owner of this seal had actually been able to re-seal the Great Nine Underworlds Door here was already shocking.</p><p>While it was far from comparable to resisting the entire Nine Underworlds and the numerous Evil Devils that resided within, the Great Nine Underworlds Door was a true dimensional passageway entrance that had opened.</p><p>A remnant fist-intent incarnation from so many years ago had actually been able to directly seal the dimensional passageway between the two worlds. What sort of cultivation base must the original owner of the great golden seal have attained?</p><p>Logically speaking, such strength should not be something that the Eight Extremities World could accept and bear.</p><p>While the two Nine Underworld Evil Devils had gradually broken out of the seal and shot into the Eight Extremities World just now, after seeing them, Yan Zhaoge had been able to feel that even if they had been able to come completely to the Eight Extremities World, the strength they possessed would actually still be incomplete.</p><p>While they would still be extremely powerful, they would still be suppressed and restricted to the equivalent of the peak of the third level of the Martial Saint realm.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge felt that the true strength of these two true Devils should actually be greater than that.</p><p>Connecting this to the words left behind by his mother, Xue Chuqing, Yan Zhaoge deduced that if one’s cultivation base had surpassed the third level of the Martial Saint realm, he or she would likely not be able to continuing staying on in the Eight Extremities World.</p><p>No expert who had attained the fourth level of the Martial Saint realm had ever been confirmed to appear in the post-Great Calamity Eight Extremities World.</p><p>When the one with the highest actual combat power, the Exalted Heaven Shaker Zhan Dongge had perished, he had been at the second level of the Martial Saint realm.</p><p>The one with the highest cultivation base, the Purple Sun Martial Saint Zhang Chao, had been at the third level of the Martial Saint realm when he had disappeared. Still, when he had last appeared before worldly eyes, according to the projections of the Heaven Diviner Zhan Xilou and some other experts, with the strength that he had displayed then, he should still have yet to reach the peak of the third level of the Martial Saint realm at that time.</p><p>In other words, he had still yet to have a chance to attempt his breakthrough into the fourth level of the Martial Saint realm.</p><p>Still, this was just the guess of some people. The exact situation of the Purple Sun Martial Saint Zhang Chao had always been a mystery.</p><p>While there was a rumour amongst the common people that the Sacred Sun Saint Purple Sun Zhang had ascended in broad daylight, the Sacred Sun Clan had always guarded their tongues regarding this issue, not providing any definitive answer.</p><p>Therefore, there was still no way to verify the issue of whether having reached the fourth level of the Martial Saint realm, one would still be able to stay on within the Eight Extremities World.</p><p>However, having seen the situation with those two true Devils today, Yan Zhaoge felt that this guess was most likely to be real.</p><p>“A strand of fist-intent that had been left behind for so many years actually still possessed the ability to seal the opening Great Nine Underworlds Door. Such strength is really not simple. However did he manage to temporarily reside within the Eight Extremities World before?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge gazed at that great golden seal, “You’re not simple as well.”</p><p>When the power of the great golden seal had erupted just now, the scene of the entire Eight Extremities World being shaken as if it was intolerable by the heavens was something Yan Zhaoge had not overlooked.</p><p>Meanwhile, that power which had erupted was still far from this treasure’s true limit!</p><p>Able to continue residing within the Eight Extremities World, it was precisely because it existed in a slumbering state, its power never ever having been fully unleashed.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge had seen such an existence in the current Eight Extremities World before, just that mere one.</p><p>The Extreme Yin Crown!</p><p>While this Sacred Artifact appeared mighty as it was wieldable even by Maidens of Extreme Yin of the Martial Scholar realm to unleash great strength, it actually existed in a slumbering state as well. When its power was drawn upon by Meng Wan or the others, it was merely equivalent to blinking a little within its sleep as it didn’t even count as lazily stretching one’s waist.</p><p>After all, the current cultivation bases of Meng Wan and the others were still low.</p><p>“Extreme Yin Crown…” Yan Zhaoge’s eyes narrowed into slits, “Extreme Yang Seal.”</p><p>Just now, as Yan Zhaoge had circulated his profound arts and drawn on the Extreme Yang Scripture that he could not be considered to be very familiar with, communicating with that fist-intent incarnation in order to unleash the power of the great crimson seal, strange and wondrous scenes had suddenly appeared within his mind.</p><p>The colourful illusory scenes had finally converged to manifest into a single will.</p><p>The Sacred Artifact, the Extreme Yang Seal.</p><p>What Yan Zhaoge had taken notice of was that in one of those numerous scenes of light had actually appeared the figure of a woman.</p><p>She had been enveloped completely by a clear light, the Extreme Yin Crown on her head.</p><p>The woman from the ‘memories’ of the pillar of the Divine Palace that Yan Zhaoge had viewed when refining it had appeared once more.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
