And he additionally knew, as even Ying Longtu himself did not, that the higher echelons of the clan had already discussed on also granting Ying Longtu the authority to freely enter and exit the first three levels of the Martial Repository as he liked after he had reached the Xiantian Martial Scholar stage.</p><p>To become the fourth Martial Scholar of Broad Creed Mountain following Zhan Dongge, Yan Di and Yan Zhaoge to receive this special honour.</p><p>From this, it could be seen that the clan looked upon Ying Longtu very highly. Still, Yan Zhaoge knew that this was a matter of after Han Long’er reached the Xiantian stage.</p><p>“Could they have decided to bring it forward?” Yan Zhaoge looked curiously at Ying Longtu.</p><p>In truth, Yan Zhaoge hoped for Ying Longtu to be granted this special right as soon as possible. He had similarly deposited great hopes on this junior apprentice-brother of his.</p><p>Han Long’er laughed happily as he seemed to be asking for praise, “Senior apprentice-brother Yan, I previously obtained permission to go tempering outside of the clan as well. Chief said my performance was good and I had performed a merit, and he rewarded me with the chance to enter the third level of the Martial Repository once.”</p><p>Hearing Ying Longtu speak on it in detail, only now did Yan Zhaoge know that not long ago, Ying Longtu had gone out to experience the world and, in the process, saved some people of Turbid Wave Pavilion.</p><p>With this matter being one that involved another Sacred Ground, its significance was naturally different. Therefore, the level of the reward was naturally different as well.</p><p>Seeing how the youth before him looked to be begging for praise, Yan Zhaoge smiled, “This is a good thing ah; Han Long’er has grown up.”</p><p>Receiving Yan Zhaoge’s praise, Ying Longtu appeared even happier.</p><p>Looking at Han Long’er, Yan Zhaoge smiled as well.</p><p>That tender, dazed face that had been filled with tears back at Cloud Portent Mountain by that little child who had lost both his parents seemed to appear before his eyes once more, leaving him emotional beyond compare.</p><p>While it was due to having discovered his supreme Big Dipper Body back then that he had guided him into Broad Creed Mountain, seeing Ying Longtu’s smiling face now, Yan Zhaoge felt extremely joyful as well.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Yan Zhaoge patted the youth’s shoulder, “My father’s thinking is indeed right. Han Long’er, you are suited to learning a wide variety of martial arts.”</p><p>“You have already learnt palm-based martial arts, movement techniques as well as sabre arts, so you should indeed pick up a sword-based martial art after this.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge continued, “After you have finished cultivating in this sword art, you can restart the cycle and learn palm-based martial arts once more, picking either the Golden Curtain Palm or the Tushita Palm. Afterwards, it would be the sabre once more, the Eight Sceneries Spirit Sabre. Following that, it would be the remaining sword art that you would cultivate in.”</p><p>“You have the ability to master all of the Eight Extreme Arts.”</p><p>As Yan Zhaoge spoke about the martial dao, Ying Longtu’s expression grew solemn as much sincerity could be seen within, “Senior apprentice-brother Yan, I’ll work hard.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said, “According to the usual rules of our clan, after you step into the Xiantian Martial Scholar realm, the clan will bestow a spirit artifact upon you. Still, since you have already begun to go out for tempering, as a safeguard, senior apprentice-brother will just gift you once first.”</p><p>“Since you are about to begin cultivating in a sword-based martial art, I will gift you a spirit artifact sword, as encouragement as well as to spur you on.”</p><p>Saying thus, Yan Zhaoge flicked his sleeve, green light flickering as a jade green sword appeared within his hand which he promptly passed over to Ying Longtu.</p><p>“Jade Dragon Sword?!” Having returned behind Yan Zhaoge, as Yin Liuhua saw how close Yan Zhaoge and Ying Longtu were, she had already been very envious of it, being even more envious now upon hearing that Yan Zhaoge intended to gift Ying Longtu a spirit artifact.</p><p>But when she clearly saw what spirit artifact it was, she could not help but cry out in shock.</p><p>Resembling a statue as she had remained unmoving with her upraised sabre, as Feng Yunsheng saw the Jade Dragon Sword, she was also momentarily taken aback by it somewhat.</p><p>While the Jade Dragon Sword was a low-grade spirit artifact, it was the artifact with which Yan Zhaoge had become famous, also being the first spirit artifact that Yan Zhaoge had ever obtained.</p><p>This spirit artifact had followed Yan Zhaoge in his numerous battles all about the Eight Extremities World, its shadow always visible behind Yan Zhaoge in recent years amidst his rise to glory.</p><p>After Yan Zhaoge defeated his foes, he had collected a large amount of spirit artifacts, but it had always been the Jade Dragon Sword that he was rather more familiar with and prone to use.</p><p>Accompanied by Yan Zhaoge stepping into the Essence Spirit Martial Grandmaster realm, however, this low-grade spirit artifact seemed to have become outdated for him.</p><p>Still, with the significance of this spirit artifact being so unimaginably great, it would have been fine even if he had just retained it as a keepsake.</p><p>At this moment, he actually intended to gift it to Ying Longtu.</p><p>Yin Liuhua aside, even Feng Yunsheng felt this to be unexpected, “Senior apprentice-brother Yan..”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge smiled, “A sword being obscured in dust is a tragic thing. Rather than gathering dust alongside me, it would be far better if I gave it to Han Long’er, heartily drinking the fresh blood of our enemies. That is actually the best place for this spirit artifact to reside.”</p><p>Saying thus, Yan Zhaoge gently stroked the blade of the Jade Dragon Sword. Jade light scattered, the roar of a dragon resounding.</p><p>Amidst his spiritual connection with the sword, it seemed somewhat reluctant at their parting, yet contained greater joy alongside that.</p><p>As Yan Zhaoge’s fingers drew past the blade of the sword, he too felt somewhat emotional within.</p><p>It was precisely because of his feelings for this spirit artifact that he had kept it intact rather than using it to forge or refine the dark green bamboo branch like he had used the Radiant Sun Wheel, the Incinerating Light Sword, the Flying Thunder Sabre and those other spirit artifacts.</p><p>Still, if this sword whose blade was still keen and sharp was sealed dustily within its scabbard, not seeing the light of the day, it would inevitably be rather too tragic.</p><p>He could carry it by his side whilst not using it, using it just to satisfy his own remembrances in taking it out for a look whenever he wanted.</p><p>However, this inevitably seemed rather unfair to the Jade Dragon Sword itself.</p><p>Swords were not ceremonial objects but potent weapons used to feast upon the blood of one’s enemies. They should be on the frontline of battle at any single moment, thereby not letting down the gloriousness of their sharpness.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge handed the Jade Dragon Sword over to Ying Longtu, saying, “In my hands, it has slain over a hundred enemies. Let’s see if it will be fewer or greater in your hands.”</p><p>Ying Longtu appeared rather dazed yet still comprehending the significance of this somewhat as he gingerly accepted the Jade Dragon Sword, “Thank you, senior apprentice-brother Yan.”</p><p>Feng Yunsheng said, “Senior apprentice-brother Yan, what will you use after this then…”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge smiled, “If it is mid-grade spirit artifacts, I can already forge them on my own. Still, there isn’t much of a need for weapons. At most, I would only forge some defensive equipment.”</p><p>“Don’t you worry. While I do not have any weapon that I am familiar with now, after Grand Master has opened his furnace, I’ll go take a walk over at his place.”</p><p>As compared to mid and low-grade spirit artifacts, high-grade spirit artifacts were far rarer as well as more precious. Even Sacred Grounds like Broad Creed Mountain did not have an abundant supply of them.</p><p>For Essence Talisman Martial Grandmasters and the Transcending Mortality Martial Grandmasters above them, even spirit artifacts for them were also basically a single pit a carrot, with no extra ones that could be bestowed upon martial practitioners of a lower cultivation base.</p><p>Still, it was also precisely because of this that as Yan Zhaoge had stepped into the Essence Spirit Martial Grandmaster realm, as a Martial Saint, Yuan Zhengfeng would be personally opening his furnace and preparing a new weapon for him.</p><p>Sacred Artifacts were rare, and high-grade spirit artifacts were hard to come by as well. Still, a high-grade spirit artifact that was forged by Yuan Zhengfeng would definitely be one of the utmost quality.</p><p>Looking first at Yan Zhaoge and next at Ying Longtu, Feng Yunsheng smiled as well.</p><p>The passing down of the torch was naught but this.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
