Instead, it seems to be qi cultivators like us?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge nodded, “That’s right, it is precisely so. It is just that the cultivation techniques that they use originate from the power of a true dragon. Using the blood of dragons as support, a human can indeed successfully cultivate dragon qi within his body. Still, that also depends on how talented that particular qi cultivator is.”</p><p>Amidst his words, five dragons of bloodred light rampaged through the air, surrounding the streaks of black and white light in mid-air.</p><p>A voice resounded from amongst them, “You husband and wife can be considered lucky, actually having opened a dimensional passageway and escaped to another world.”</p><p>“However, your good luck ends here. This will be your final resting place, your bones buried in a foreign land.”</p><p>Hearing these words, Yan Zhaoge felt emotional to the point of near crying.</p><p>Because the language used by the other side was one that he could understand.</p><p>Although there were still some differences more or less, it was extremely similar to a language commonly used before the Great Calamity.</p><p>While it was different from the language normally used by his mother, Xue Chuqing, it was of a similar style, both being commonly used languages of before the Great Calamity that had further developed in different ways.</p><p>Being familiar with the pre-Great Calamity languages, it was not so taxing for Yan Zhaoge to understand the other side’s words now.</p><p>As compared to the pain he had felt just having encountered the language of the Floating Life World, Yan Zhaoge truly felt incomparably grateful at this moment.</p><p>It was also precisely because all of them had been no different from the deaf when they had first arrived in the Floating Life World that Feng Yunsheng, Xu Fei and the others had also felt greatly pained, beginning to ask Yan Zhaoge to teach them some language- related knowledge and skills.</p><p>Whether it was that of the Eight Extremities World, the Floating Life World or the language currently used before them, all of them were inextricably linked with the old pre-Great Calamity languages as they stemmed from the same source.</p><p>Therefore, whilst having learnt the language of the Floating Life World, Feng Yunsheng, Xu Fei and the others had also diligently studied the pre-Great Calamity languages.</p><p>Listening to that person speak now, while they could not fully understand it, they were still able to catch some crucial information from it.</p><p>Entrapped by the five blood dragons, the black and white streaks of light were halted within the air.</p><p>The figures of a man and a woman now appeared before Yan Zhaoge and the others. It was a middle-aged couple.</p><p>Both of the two were injured as the husband protected his wife behind him, saying hatefully, “Your Blood Dragon Sect and my Changli Mountain both belong to the Seven Pillars of Good which stand together against the Six Evil Sects. Yet, in your actions today, are you trying to cause a huge war between our two sects, thereby causing internal rife amongst us forces of good?”</p><p>From the same blood dragon resounded, “I should be thanking you then. Having left our Vast Ocean World and come to this completely foreign world, if you die here, who of Changli Mountain will know?”</p><p>As the bloodred light flickered, an old man appeared. He wore a black robe, his hands beside his back as he looked at that couple with a sunken expression on his face.</p><p>In the other directions, the scales of the other four blood dragons pulsated, releasing a great amount of bloodred light.</p><p>This bloodred light retracted, the figure of a martial practitioner appearing in the air where each of the blood dragons had been as they all emanated a sense of great power amidst their actions.</p><p>Four people, each occupying a corner, trapped the couple within their midst.</p><p>The old man raised his head to look at the dimensional passageway within the air, “The tunnel is extremely unstable. It must have just temporarily opened, and should be closing again very soon.”</p><p>“We will kill you in this unknown world before immediately returning to our Vast Ocean World. Meanwhile, you will have vanished completely without a trace from the Vast Ocean World. How is there anything more perfect than that?”</p><p>Looks of despair appeared on the faces of the surrounded couple.</p><p>However, they did not give up hope. As they exchanged glances, both could see resolve in the gaze of the other.</p><p>The husband and wife simultaneously let out a long roar. Now, a white sword-light shot into the sky from the scabbard on the man’s back, a black sword-light correspondingly shooting over from the woman’s scabbard as the two sword-lights intermingled, shining together.</p><p>The husband and wife joined forces with their twin swords of white and black which spun upwards, attempting to force a breakthrough from their encirclement.</p><p>Seeing this, Yan Zhaoge’s eyes lit up slightly, “Oh? One yin, one yang, intermingled and connected in tacit cooperation. It indeed exhibits some of the true principles of yin-yang coexistence.”</p><p>“For the twin swords of this husband and wife, their combined power is greater than the sum of their parts.”</p><p>The black and white sword-lights shot into the skies. Seeing this, the expression of the black-robed old man did not change as he made a hand signal.</p><p>The four other martial practitioners let out loud roars in unison, roaring apart the winds and clouds.</p><p>The acupoints of their entire bodies pulsed, roiling bloodred light surging outwards as illusory scenes formed above their heads.</p><p>Within those images, several leaves swayed. They were all actually mid Essence Spirit Martial Grandmasters, experts at the fifth level of the Martial Grandmaster realm.</p><p>Their surging true essence was filled with spirituality, false turning into real as they directly transformed into numerous blood dragons that enveloped their bodies before shooting towards the black and white sword-lights together.</p><p>The yin-yang combination power of the twin swords was spectacular. As the sword-lights traversed the horizon, the combined might of the four blood dragons was actually unable to do anything to them for a time.</p><p>The black-robed old man did not find this to be unexpected. The combined twin swords of Changli Mountain was famed throughout the entire Vast Ocean World. While the husband and wife before him were still only mid Essence Spirit Martial Grandmasters, when combining their powers, they would even be able to battle against him, a late Essence Spirit Martial Grandmaster, to some extent.</p><p>If the black-robed old man made a move now, this couple would not be able to withstand their combined might.</p><p>However, located within a foreign world now, he did not dare to overextend himself as he stood by the side, staying vigilant against sudden changes to the situation.</p><p>This was especially so with him having already seen Yan Zhaoge and the others. Unaware of their intentions, this black-robed old man did not make a move against them.</p><p>“Since that couple is already injured, as long as they are surrounded and time drags on, they will eventually be unable to hold on,” The black-robed old man’s gaze fell on Yan Zhaoge and the others, “It is rather the people here that form an uncertain factor. While their cultivation bases look to be limited, I wonder what kind of paths they walk?”</p><p>Receiving that black-robed old man’s gaze, Yan Zhaoge smiled noncommittally, just interestedly spectating the clash between the four blood dragons and the two-sword lights in mid-air.</p><p>Ah Hu asked, “Young Master, what will we do?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
