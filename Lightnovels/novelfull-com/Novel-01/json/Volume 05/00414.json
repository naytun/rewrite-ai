Yan Zhaoge didn’t mind if another person was added on. Moreover, he was only pretty good terms with Feng Yunsheng.</p><p>“I’m naturally fine with it, but I wonder how junior apprentice-sister Feng feels about it?” Yan Zhaoge said, “From her words, she wants to go out to experience danger this time.”</p><p>“If I can control the situation, she naturally won’t be in any danger. However, if I don’t make a move, just being there alone is already an intimidation to the enemy. However much she controls her mentality, she would inevitably end up relying on me somewhat.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge spread his hands apart, “And if even I can’t control the situation, let alone being tempered, we would all be finished together.”</p><p>Yuan Zhengfeng said, “Where does perfection exist in this world? We can only do as much as is possible. With Yunsheng’s clarity of mind, she naturally understands this as well.”</p><p>“Speaking of which, this is already the most suitable choice. Zhaoge, you are currently already at the fourth level of the Martial Grandmaster realm, an early Essence Spirit Martial Grandmaster, and the strength that you exhibit when truly in combat far surpasses the norm. Along with your many treasures, there are already not many who can truly endanger you.”</p><p>“Meanwhile, you would able to withstand most of the dangers that could befall Yunsheng, who’s still a Martial Scholar. Even if you make a move at the final moment, you would still be in time.”</p><p>“As for opponents that even you cannot cope with, at the end of the day, the Marsh of Illusory Sea that you will be going to this time is the territory of Turbid Wave Pavilion. Turbid Wave Pavilion is strictly neutral, and will definitely not allow the higher echelon experts of the Sacred Sun Clan and the Heavenly Thunder Hall to enter the Marsh of Illusory Sea to do harm to you.”</p><p>Hearing this, Yan Zhaoge nodded, “It is indeed so.”</p><p>Yuan Zhengfeng said, “Therefore, going over this time, the threat posed by natural disasters is far greater than that by humans. As one of the six great danger grounds of our Eight Extremities World, even though the Marsh of Illusory Sea is currently in a period of deterioration, it is still not something that can be underestimated.”</p><p>“As compared to the storms of the Great Western Desert, the extreme coldness of the Extreme Northern Snowy Plains and the blazing fire of the Southern Underground Palace, the threat of the Marsh of Illusory Sea seems not to be that great. Still, its threat is formless and instead even harder to guard against.”</p><p>Lost within the environment of the Marsh of Illusory Sea, one would very possibly inadvertently come to lose their life.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said, “Yes, Grand Master. Rest assured; I am aware of this.”</p><p>Finally, it was decided that other than Feng Yunsheng, Xu Fei and Shi Jun, Ying Longtu would be coming along as well.</p><p>“Such a chance is truly hard found. Bring Longtu along with you,” Yan Di very casually waved his hand.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge found this to be a little funny. He had already not performed similar tasks for quite a long time.</p><p>Not just Broad Creed Mountain, the other Sacred Grounds and other major powers would generally also use the method of the old leading the new, allowing their younger disciples to go out and temper themselves.</p><p>The one leading the group might be someone of the senior generation, but it might also be a senior apprentice-brother or sister who had entered the clan earlier than them and possessed a higher cultivation base.</p><p>This had been the case when Yan Zhaoge had brought Sikong Qing, Ye Jing and some others to the Sealing Dragon Abyss some time ago.</p><p>However, Yan Zhaoge’s cultivation speed had been too great. Despite his young age, the distance between him and the other disciples of the younger generation was extremely pronounced.</p><p>If he were to lead teams out now, it would therefore be very awkward.</p><p>Going to a place that was dangerous, those brought along by him would completely become his burden. They would just be brought along by him like objects, completely protected by him as the goal of tempering would not be achieved at all.</p><p>If the place he went too was not that dangerous, it would appear like a waste of his talents.</p><p>For this current trip, Little Shi Jun aside, the one with the lowest cultivation base, Ying Longtu, was already an outer aura Martial Scholar, meanwhile being exceptionally talented and not weak at all.</p><p>Xu Fei was at the second level of the Martial Grandmaster realm, a mid Spirit Vessel Martial Grandmaster. If not for Yan Zhaoge having leapt up by three consecutive levels within a short period of time, it might instead have been him leading the team this time.</p><p>Regarding leading teams, Xu Fei was naturally much more experienced in it than Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>Those who would be going on this trip basically consisted of all the most brilliant elites of Broad Creed Mountain’s younger generation these past years other than Sikong Qing.</p><p>Ying Longtu aside, Yan Zhaoge, Xu Fei and Feng Yunsheng actually all possessed the ability to lead younger disciples of the clan along in going out to temper themselves.</p><p>While he would be the leader in name, Yan Zhaoge actually did not have to worry much about it. After bidding his father farewell, he took up that old mantle once more and headed out with Xu Fei and the others.</p><p>Ah Hu and Pan-Pan naturally went along as well.</p><p>Currently, the global situation of the Eight Extremities World appeared rather calm due to just having experienced that invasion by the Flame Devils.</p><p>However, Yan Zhaoge and the other all knew that now was precisely when hidden undercurrents were surging beneath, even having reached the point of the arrow having been strung, with tempestuous storms set to descend at any moment.</p><p>Jade Sea City’s Lord Song Wuliang was in secluded cultivation recovering from his injuries, the Sacred Sun Clan and the Heavenly Thunder Hall, one in the north and one in the south, both raring to make a move.</p><p>As Jade Sea City’s ally, Broad Creed Mountain and Infinite Boundless Mountain were ever vigilant, ready to reinforce Jade Sea City at a moment’s notice.</p><p>Yuan Zhengfeng personally moved out, bringing the Clear Qi Robe along with him to an area of the Earth Domain, stationing himself between the Fire and Water Domains while meanwhile still being able to watch over the Heaven Domain from far away.</p><p>Yan Di and the others stayed behind to guard the clan, also ready to move out at a moment’s notice.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge and the others were brought by Yuan Zhengfeng to the Earth Domain, after which they parted from their Grand Master and headed south towards the Lake Domain.</p><p>Leaving the Earth Domain, having arrived in the territory of the Lake Domain, Yan Zhaoge and the others could finally temporarily set their hearts at ease.</p><p>While Turbid Wave Pavilion’s Lord An Qinglin was also heavily injured and in secluded cultivation, there was a low possibility of the Sacred Sun Clan making a move on this place. In the event of that happening, Yuan Zhengfeng would also be able to immediately rush north to save them.</p><p>“Senior apprentice-brother Xu, only now do I understand. You coming here-it is also for Senior Sister Xie, right?” As Yan Zhaoge guided Ying Longtu in practising the Big Dipper Sword, he smiled at Xu Fei.</p><p>Between the Big Dipper Sword and the Great Heaven Earth Sword, Ying Longtu had finally chosen the former.</p><p>The martial arts of the Eight Extreme Arts that he had cultivated in previously, the Vajra Body, the Chaotic Elements Uniting Sabre and the Wind Fire Calamities all walked the path of heaviness, being sharp and tyrannical.</p><p>Since he was following the path of keeping and accumulating his power, he naturally had to cultivate in such an intricate martial art.</p><p>Therefore, following Yan Di’s suggestion, Ying Longtu had chosen the Big Dipper Sword.</p><p>Anyway, having come out this time, while there was Yan Zhaoge, there was also Xu Fei. Regardless of which of the two sword arts he chose, there would also be someone there to guide him.</p><p>Teased by Yan Zhaoge, Xu Fei was not troubled as he said, “Junior Sister Xie entered secluded cultivation before this time’s invasion of the Flame Devils on the East Sea in preparation for her breakthrough into the Martial Grandmaster realm.”</p><p>“So that’s how it is. Back during the fifth Extreme Yin Bout, I still met her once. Still, at that time, Senior Sister Xie had already successfully entered the Heavenly Connection stage. Entering secluded cultivation in order to make preparations for her breakthrough into the Martial Grandmaster realm is also a very normal thing,” Yan Zhaoge stroked his lower chin before chuckling towards Xu Fei, “Still, you know about it very well, senior apprentice-brother Xu. The two of you are very close.”</p><p>Xu Fei laughed, “Is that very surprising?”</p><p>With Xu Fei being so straightforward, the gossipy flames within Yan Zhaoge’s heart instead died down, “Huh…it’s indeed also not that surprising. After all, the two of you are yet to be hitched…”</p><p>Rarely seeing Yan Zhaoge looking defeated like this, Feng Yunsheng and Ah Hu were both greatly amused.</p><p>Ying Longtu still looked a little dazed, “Senior apprentice-brother Yan, senior apprentice-brother Xu, what are the two of you talking about?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge answered lazily, “We were talking about when your senior apprentice-brother Xu will get a wife. Right…just like your parents. Still, your senior apprentice-brother Xu will still have to wait for quite a while. On our trip this time, he will not be able to see his future wife-she’s in secluded cultivation.”</p><p>Han Long’er nodded, looking like he might have understood though maybe also not, before he suddenly asked out of the blue, “Then, when will senior apprentice-brother Yan be getting a wife?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
