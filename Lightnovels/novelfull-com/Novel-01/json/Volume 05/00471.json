The resistance by the rampaging, violent emotions emanating from the black fog down below also grew more intense.</p><p>As Yan Zhaoge looked, he saw the space where the black fog and the huge sun were colliding unceasingly breaking apart.</p><p>The shattered space instantly regained its original state yet shattered again soon after, such a cycle repeating non-stop.</p><p>That destructive power would not be approached by anyone. Swept within it, one would be ripped apart along with that space in an instant.</p><p>Yet, the seal formed of the huge golden sun was still stable at the end of the day as bolstered by Yuan Zhengfeng and Shen Li, it suppressed the black fog borne of the Nine Underworlds once more.</p><p>The numerous black chains extending towards the surroundings now resembled tentacles as they waved about unceasingly.</p><p>The countless black runes that formed the chains circulated unceasingly, the red light on their surface flickering non-stop.</p><p>One Evil Devil after another was born to those black chains to be slain continuously by the peak experts of the human race here.</p><p>However, these Evil Devils seemed inextinguishable and without end as while those initial ones had been destroyed, many more appeared later on as they came to take their place.</p><p>The Evil Devils let out multiple howls, the entire deep abyss filled with the chaotic dance of devils.</p><p>The experts of the human race dealt with this, not simply fighting them head-on as they just kept the Evil Devils at bay, not letting them rush over and interfere with the seal.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge’s figure descended as he arrived above the huge golden sun. There, Fang Zhun was enshrouded by golden and black streams of light as he sunk alongside the huge golden sun.</p><p>“Second apprentice-uncle,” Yan Zhaoge interlocked his palms before pulling them apart, some of the shackles of light on Fang Zhun’s body that resembled chains breaking apart.</p><p>However, the shackles of light shook and very quickly entangled Fang Zhun again.</p><p>Fang Zhun said, “No hurry. It will be fine to wait for the seal to be completed before taking care of this.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge nodded as he recalled that previous feeling of breaking the shackles of light, analysing the changes in power within.</p><p>Fang Zhun lowered his head and looked at the huge golden sun down below before looking again at Yuan Zhengfeng and Shen Li, “With this, it can be considered to have been daunting yet uneventful here at the Earth Domain.”</p><p>“Instead, over at the East Sea, while the advance of the Flame Devils has been obstructed, it is possible that they have deployed some of their troops towards drawing the attention of us human experts whilst causing trouble elsewhere all around.”</p><p>“It is not just the Water Domain. The Lake and Thunder Domains may possibly be attacked as well. We require sufficient power to obstruct them. The destruction they cause on the mainland would be much more serious than that caused by them over the great sea.”</p><p>“We should settle the matter here at the Earth Domain as quickly as possible. Master and Shen Li need to rush without rest to the East Sea as well.”</p><p>Hearing this, Yan Zhaoge said softly, “We still cannot let down out guard over here as well. Our enemy may launch a desperate, all-out counterattack at the final, most critical moment.”</p><p>Feng Zhun nodded, “That is so.”</p><p>Amidst the suppression of the seal over at the Earth Domain where time was truly of the essence, the great battle over at the East Sea had already long reached its most intense stage.</p><p>No one remained in the Outer East Sea as Long Ocean City that connected the Outer and Inner East Seas had also already become a wasteland.</p><p>Long Ocean City of the Water Domain’s Nine Cities and the island on which it had been located had already been incinerated to nothingness, no longer existing.</p><p>Even the region of sea where Jade Sea City was located was filled with chaos as well.</p><p>Jade Sea City was facing another tribulation, and one even greater in scale than the previous one had been.</p><p>With Jing Zhong at their head, the four Flame Devil Kings who were equivalent to human experts at the second level of the Martial Saint realm had East Dragon Island and Jade Sea City completely surrounded.</p><p>Led by them, the other Flame Devil Kings and the Great Flame Devils swept over like an unstoppable tide as they frenziedly attacked Jade Sea City.</p><p>Within Jade Sea City, the Jade Sea Limitless Grand Formation had expanded, the limitless jade sea keeping the blazing fire at bay.</p><p>Jade Sea City’s Lord Song Wuliang presided over the core of the grand formation, shrouded by formless sword-lights which circulated all around him in an endless stream, having become one with the jade sea of the surroundings.</p><p>With Song Wuliang’s Jade Sea Pill Heart Sword as the core of the grand formation through which it was wielded, the power of the formation was naturally far from comparable to how it had been in the past.</p><p>The Painting Saint Old Man Mo stood beside Song Wuliang, one hand behind his back while his other hand was unceasingly drawing within the air.</p><p>One painting scroll after another was inscribed within the air, endlessly turning real and manifesting.</p><p>Old Man Mo was currently only drawing a single thing, which was an infinite ocean.</p><p>Countless painting scrolls, all depicting infinite surging seawater, merged within the Jade Sea Limitless Grand Formation, joining it in resisting the blazing fire that surged to the heavens.</p><p>For a time, gazing far into the distance, one would see the sky above painted crimson, filled completely with blazing fire, while below was endless, surging seawater.</p><p>The boundary between sky and sea had already vanished as water and fire clashed unceasingly.</p><p>Dense white water vapour having just been produced, it would then be overwhelmed and consumed by the ensuing collision of blazing fire and seawater immediately after.</p><p>Even while Song Wuliang possessed the aid of the local Jade Sea Limitless Grand Formation as well as Old Man Mo’s assistance, he was helpless against the fact that the other side’s experts were really too many.</p><p>Under the tempestuous assaults of blazing fire, Jade Sea City’s guardian grand formation shook and swayed amidst the storms, deficient all around as cracks were unceasingly ripped apart within it.</p><p>Within the grand formation, the Sacred Sun Clan’s Meng Wan wielded the Extreme Yin Crown while Infinite Boundless Mountain’s Chu Yan wielded the Heaven Cleaving Axe, both moving to obstruct the Flame Devils trying to get in through those cracks.</p><p>The two sides expended in continuous bloodied battle, Song Wuliang, Old Man Mo, Meng Wan and Chu Yan all being injured in some way or another to differing extents.</p><p>Still, they could only grit their teeth and hold on now.</p><p>Now, the attacks of the Flame Devils eased slightly.</p><p>As Jing Zhong and the other Flame Devils gazed towards where sky and ocean intersected in the west, they could only see a sun seemingly rising from the west, bringing along with it all-encompassing radiance amidst its sudden appearance.</p><p>Near the sun coiled a bunch of white clouds, never dissipating even as it was illuminated by the sun’s rays.</p><p>It was precisely Huang Guanglie and An Qinglin who had arrived as reinforcements.</p><p>The Flame Devil race wanted to send out some of its peak experts to intercept them as Jing Zhong and the others thought to switch their targets to them instead, first taking care of they who lacked the support of the grand formation and appeared lacking with just their own power.</p><p>However, the Jade Sea Limitless Grand Formation which had always just been taking a beating earlier, having appeared like it might soon just easily collapse, suddenly erupted with a counterattack.</p><p>Limitless tides even extended far into the distance, sweeping along Huang Guanglie and An Qinglin.</p><p>Now, Huang Guanglie and An Qinglin unleashed their power, working together in concert with the people within Jade Sea City as they joined up together with them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
