He was also their youngest late Seeing Divinity stage expert.</p><p>Over the years, Yang Chong had also participated in battles against the filthy Buddhists, slaying many of those devilish experts.</p><p>It was not just the Lofty Towering World. He reputation was well known even in the Loathing Square Immortal Realm as some peak experts even thought quite highly of him.</p><p>He was a good sapling of the Immortal Court’s orthodox tradition.</p><p>Everyone had believed that he was to become the sect’s youngest Immortal Bridge Martial Saint ever since its founding, taking over the old Chief to assume the leadership of the Chaotic Heavenly Sect whereupon he would lead it to new heights, attaining high status in the entire Immortal Realm.</p><p>Yet, not long ago, something had gone wrong with him after he had led a team out to deal with that relic site.</p><p>Quan Haolong who had always been looked after by Yang Chong had only felt disbelief at first. After witnessing that weakened treasured light in Yang Chong’s body, however, only panic had remained within his heart.</p><p>He could not imagine how this senior apprentice-uncle Yang whom he had always respected and looked up to so might have ended up like this.</p><p>After hearing the other party’s words, Yan Zhaoge and Fu Ting both frowned.</p><p>The same thought arose in both their minds.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said casually, “Stop boasting. Do you know what an Emperor entails?”</p><p>The other party laughed loudly, “You have no need to deliberately antagonise me. So what if I tell you? It will just as well let you know how you evil followers of the external dao will ultimately end up!”</p><p>“That person was titled the Dim Radiant Emperor, and his name was Yin Tianxia. He led the Dim Radiant Sect, this being a dao tradition and legacy which already existed in this world before the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord cleansed the world.”</p><p>“After cleansing the world, it was out of benevolence that the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord allowed you of the external dao and the Buddhist devils to continue surviving. Yet, you who still understand not the will of the heavens and instead defy it will ultimately all be punished in the end!”</p><p>This Chaotic Heavenly Sect martial practitioner roared, “Understanding not the will of the heavens, respecting not the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord, the fate that befell those Buddhist devils slain by the experts of the Immortal Court and that Yin Tianxia will be the fate that befalls you very soon!”</p><p>His appearance was severe as he said this. Still, Yan Zhaoge and Fu Ting could not be bothered listening to his nonsense any longer.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge raised his head and surveyed the Lofty Towering World before him.</p><p>He had indeed been trying to provoke the other party into speaking.</p><p>This was because he had already guessed it just now.</p><p>The Dim Radiant Emperor Yin Tianxia had not perished to the Nine Underworlds or Buddhism as he had previously guessed.</p><p>Instead, it was this world of the Immortal Court where he had fallen!</p><p>Besides Yin Tianxia himself, many other peak experts of his sect had also fallen here.</p><p>As a result, the Dim Radiant Sect which had once reigned mightily in the World beyond Worlds had ultimately declined and fallen apart.</p><p>Yet, a new doubt now arose.</p><p>Why had Yin Tianxia led an expedition to this distant land that year?</p><p>Was it because he could not tolerate the ways of the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord and the Immortal Court?</p><p>As Fu Ting had said, in the eyes of descendants of the tradition of the Three Clear lineages, the way of the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord and the Immortal Court was not the orthodox way.</p><p>However, in the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord being able to compete against the Future Buddha and the Immortal Court being able to compete with Buddhism, they were actually already mighty beyond compare.</p><p>The Dim Radiant Emperor did not seem like a reckless person. Why had he come to provoke them of his own accord?</p><p>Was it because he had not been clear regarding the level of power that the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord and the Immortal Court possessed back then or was it that he had plotted to profit as a third party in the conflict between the blessed lands of Buddhism and the Immortal Court, having sadly failed in the end?</p><p>Yan Zhaoge instinctively glanced at Fu Ting beside him.</p><p>What role did the Brocade Emperor and the other peak experts of the World beyond Worlds play here?</p><p>Noticing Yan Zhaoge’s gaze, Fu Ting immediately understood what he meant.</p><p>It was just that she was wondering the same thing herself.</p><p>Feeling greatly puzzled, Yan Zhaoge ignored that noisy Chaotic Heavenly Sect martial practitioner as he instead looked at Yang Chong, “Are things like he says?”</p><p>Yang Chong sighed, “That’s right.”</p><p>“The relic site that we handled earlier was not where experts of the external dao perished but where a battle once occurred in the past.”</p><p>Yang Chong said slowly, “It was precisely where that Dim Radiant Emperor battled the experts of my Immortal Court.”</p><p>Fu Ting asked, “If Emperor-level experts or higher were to battle in this world, it would probably be completely destroyed.”</p><p>Yang Chong explained, “They just happened to pass by the Lofty Towering World for a time as they continuously battled.”</p><p>Even so, however, a tribulation had still befallen the Lofty Towering World.</p><p>This was a great event in the history of the Lofty Towering World.</p><p>Yang Chong’s expression was rather complex, “While it was gained from the external dao, one must admit that an Emperor is an Emperor at the end of the day. Those who can claim the title of Emperor are all mighty indeed.”</p><p>“Still, as they battled, a remnant strand of will was actually condensed and left there all these years.”</p><p>He coughed, unable to project the scenes of that time due to his grave injuries.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said mildly, “I will be offending you.”</p><p>He tapped on the other party’s forehead, wisps of black qi entering as Yang Chong’s eyes instantly turned rather dazed.</p><p>Fu Ting was slightly shocked, “…Faceless Devil Scripture?”</p><p>The expressions of Quan Haolong and the others abruptly changed as they saw a black light emitted from one of Yang Chong’s eyes.</p><p>A black scene of light condensed in mid-air, images manifesting.</p><p>Amidst the ruins of the valley, all was hazy as it was neither bright nor dark.</p><p>Amidst the haziness was depicted the scene of a great battle, resembling shooting stars streaking across the horizon as numerous wild tides surged, sweeping through the heavens and the earth.</p><p>If it had been during the great battle itself, Yang Chong would not have understood its process at all.</p><p>Yet, where only the remnant aura remained in this valley of rubble, he could instead understand it.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge and the others could clearly see it as well.</p><p>The first to enter their fields of vision was a rather familiar figure.</p><p>Black clothes and white robe, long jet-black hair flowing down his back with eyebrows that were pure white in colour.</p><p>The white and black were distinct in his eyes and pure to the extreme. The whites of his eyes seemed to emit immeasurable radiance while his black pupils were instead like a deep abyss.</p><p>It was the Dim Radiant Emperor, Yin Tianxia.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
