Being competent in the palm art, one would thus be competent in the movement technique too.</p><p>Daoist East Spring went all out in his footwork now. While his movements did not seem fast, they were shockingly agile as he shifted amidst space, reducing calamity and bad luck into formlessness.</p><p>Yet, a Taiji diagram appeared beneath Yan Zhaoge’s feet, yin and yang circulating.</p><p>The next moment, yin and yang that stood on opposing sides as Taiji, Grand Ultimate, transformed into two extremities that became four phenomena and finally Eight Trigrams.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge strode forward, arriving directly in front of Daoist East Spring!</p><p>The Taiji Yin Yang Palm was similarly linked with a movement technique as it possessed infinite profundities.</p><p>Daoist East Spring’s eyes looked on the brink of imploding as Yan Zhaoge’s Cyclic Heavenly Seal mightily descended!</p><p>The old Daoist tried to raise his palms to block yet had his arms directly broken by Yan Zhaoge’s mighty palm which had within it integrated the profundities of various supreme martial arts like the Cyclic Heavenly Seal and the Taiji Yin Yang Palm.</p><p>His palm did not stop as it continued descending, caving Daoist East Spring’s head right in with a bang!</p><p>The martial practitioners of the south atop Vast Spirit Mountain were all rendered dazed and speechless at this.</p><p>Not long ago, Daoist East Spring had still been full of spirit as he had borrowed the might of Wutong Slope to suppress his longtime enemy, the Night Magnificence Sect, looking like the Alliance Chief of the Announcing Peace Mountain Range.</p><p>At this moment, however, his head had exploded as he had been reduced to a corpse.</p><p>A lofty mid Immortal Bridge stage expert was slain on the spot!</p><p>The one who had killed him was precisely Yan Zhaoge whom he had organised this alliance meet to deal with this time.</p><p>Daoist East Spring had naturally had impure attentions in organising this as it had actually been more to make use of Yan Zhaoge’s matter to strive to secure total hegemony within the Announcing Peace Mountain Range.</p><p>Sadly, Yan Zhaoge whom he had wanted to make use of had instead claimed his life.</p><p>Of all the martial practitioners of the south who were present, Yuan Xiancheng and Zhao Zhen included, who could have thought that not only would Yan Zhaoge not avoid them after arriving in the Announcing Peace Mountain Range, he would instead even take the initiative in coming straight to Vast Spirit Mountain?</p><p>It was okay that he had come. They had been feeling troubled over where to look for him in the first place.</p><p>Yet, the alliance of countless experts atop Vast Spirit Mountain was actually unable to stand against a single Yan Zhaoge who had thereby claimed his old life just like that!</p><p>After killing Daoist East Spring, Yan Zhaoge did not cease in his actions as he now guided the Cloud Circulating Heavenly Light Sword in attacking towards another direction.</p><p>There, flames wreathed the area as the clear cry of a phoenix resounded.</p><p>A phoenix flew out from amongst the flames, the man who was enveloped by its silhouette being none other than Yuan Xiancheng.</p><p>The fiery phoenixes within Yuan Xiancheng’s pupils soared, again transforming into two phoenix clones as he flew back in retreat, avoiding Yan Zhaoge’s sword.</p><p>“Jade Clear direct lineage’s Cyclic Heavenly Scripture, Yin Yang Heavenly Scripture,” Yuan Xiancheng had an incomparably solemn expression on his face, “And that sword art, what exactly is it…”</p><p>Ordinary martial practitioners who cultivated in peak martial arts, especially those with great explosive and offensive power, might have the ability to surpass levels as they clashed in a few simple exchanges.</p><p>Geniuses who cultivated in peak martial arts would be able to display even more of their intricacies.</p><p>Therefore, their martial foundation and superior innate powers of comprehension could assist them in temporarily surpassing the gap in their cultivation levels.</p><p>Such an eruption of power, however, would definitely be short-lived.</p><p>Even if they could gain the upper hand in the initial exchanges, they would still run out of stamina afterwards.</p><p>If they could overwhelm their foe within a short period of time, there was still the possibility of obtaining victory.</p><p>This was how the majority of victories by the weaker against the stronger came about in this world.</p><p>Yet, if they were unable to obtain victory within a few exchanges, there would be nothing they could do to avoid the fate of defeat.</p><p>The greater one’s cultivation base, the greater their comprehensions of martial principles as well as the depth of their accumulation and power.</p><p>Yuan Xiancheng was outstandingly talented and of the direct lineage of the Southern Exalt, originally already having been a genius who could surpass levels in battling while at the Immortal Bridge stage.</p><p>He could battle ninth level Martial Saints as an eighth level Martial Saint because he was outstanding and also cultivated in Wutong Slope’s Phoenix True Form Scripture, being bolstered by four Virtues which possessed boundless profundities.</p><p>Although he could not achieve victory through explosive power and offensive capabilities, he had shocking defensive capabilities.</p><p>Still, Yuan Xiancheng was shocked by the fact that such was clearly not the case for Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>Such fierce attacks seemed endless for him, with his power running rampant and without end casually and freely as his qi returning speed seemed to be virtually negligible.</p><p>Being from Wutong Slope, Yuan Xiancheng possessed great knowledge as he had heard of the intricate uses of the Cyclic Heavenly Scripture and Yin Yang Heavenly Scripture. However, Yan Zhaoge’s strength still left him in utter disbelief.</p><p>“Broad Creed Mountain…is such abundant accumulation really possible for a sect from the lower worlds?” Yuan Xiancheng deeply doubted this.</p><p>Having personally ‘died’ once to Yan Zhaoge’s sword, Yuan Xiancheng already dared not rely on the protection of the four Virtues to forcibly withstand Yan Zhaoge’s attacks using his phoenix body now.</p><p>Immortal Bridge Martial Saints who cultivated in the Phoenix True Form Scripture all possessed a chance to undergo nirvanic rebirth.</p><p>Yuan Xiancheng was exceptionally fortunate as having refined his eyes into phoenix clones, he had two additional chances at rebirth!</p><p>At crucial moments of life and death when it was utterly necessary, he could get his phoenix clones to die in his place.</p><p>This was the strongest aspect of ‘Phoenix Pupils’ Yuan Xiancheng, being an ultimate technique that belonged only to him.</p><p>Even ninth level Martial Saints like ‘Blazing King’ Peng He and ‘Treasured Branch Suppressing Peak’ Zhang Shuren were unable to do this.</p><p>Ever since he discovered that Yan Zhaoge had utilised Thunder of Eternal Night to slaughter a large amount of Vast Spirit Mountain martial practitioners, even having soundlessly slain a fellow sixth level Martial Saint, Yuan Xiancheng had already dared to underestimate Yan Zhaoge no longer.</p><p>Before entering this battle, he had already prepared himself to sacrifice a chance at rebirth and even an eye to enter a protracted battle with Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>However talented Yan Zhaoge was, however powerful the martial arts he cultivated in, he was still a Seeing Divinity Martial Saint at the end of the day. He did not believe that he would not be able to dwindle Yan Zhaoge down till death.</p><p>As they battled now, however, Yuan Xiancheng gradually realised that if he still continued thinking like he had earlier, he would probably perish here for good today!</p><p>The white-clothed, blue-robed youth before him possessed great power that completely surpassed his worldview!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
