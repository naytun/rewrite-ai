I’m afraid this might not be Amitabha’s hankering.”</p><p>The Dipankara Archaic Buddha smiled, “While Buddhas remain untainted from mortal affairs most of the time, some things must be done if deemed necessary. I’m but a mere hierodule and my actions shall be seen by all the Ancestral Buddhas. If the Ancestral Buddhas’ will I have defied, how could I visit thee?”</p><p>“Even if thou art right, I hath no intentions of participating,” said the Buddha within the five-colored divine flashes of brilliance in a plain tone.</p><p>The Dipankara Archaic Buddha said, “Naturally, I came here with a gift. Thou surely won’t be disappointed.”</p><p>Then, the round Buddha light behind him shook, and a sarira flew out from the glazed ancient lamp’s fire.</p><p>Looking at that sarira, the Buddha’s brows were finally raised. He stared at the Dipankara Archaic Buddha for a while and finally asked, “How many doth thee possess?”</p><p>The Dipankara Archaic Buddha smiled, “Merely one. Howbeit, I know the whereabouts of two others. One with the Elder Lord, and one with Maitreya.”</p><p>After a moment of silence, the five-colored flashes of brilliance spiraled within the air, keeping that mundane looking sarira.</p><p>The Buddha, within the flashes of brilliance, stood up, “Tell me, where should I head to.”</p><p>“I shall lead thy pathway,” answered the Dipankara Archaic Buddha.</p><p>The Buddha didn’t say anything else. The flashes of brilliance rose and instantly left the Blessed Lands of Buddhism. The group left the Western Pure Lands.</p><p>Outside the Western Pure Lands, Bhante Baixiong was already waiting.</p><p>After the two met up with each other, they both disappeared into the void’s boundless outskirts.</p><p>Within the voided universe, after the group of Devils retreated to the Nine Underworlds, the group of Daoism Grand Heavenly Realm experts went up against the Demon Race bigwigs, with the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles leading them.</p><p>The Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles intended to search for Yan Zhaoge and the others to seek revenge for his son. However, Daoism’s Heavenly Lords obstructed his pursuit. As a result, huge warfare transpired between the two sides.</p><p>With the experts of the Western Pure Lands spectating from aside, the two sides couldn’t afford to fight to the death and had to put up their guards against these Buddhist Bhante’s.</p><p>However, very quickly, everyone received news that exceeded their expectations.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge successfully harnessed the Golden Body of the Great Sage Equalling Heavens and presented the mightiness of the Grand Heavenly Realm. Then, he broke through the Immortal Court and killed a large batch of Immortal Court experts, which left the Immortal Court in shame. In fact, this could even shake the Immortal Court’s very own foundations.</p><p>The fragile balance between the two heretic factions was destroyed once again.</p><p>The Immortal Court faced the possibility of failing at any moment.</p><p>The situation between the experts of the three sides became even more subtle.</p><p>The other Great Demons still intended to head toward the Immortal Court. After all, the warfare happening there would become much more intense.</p><p>As for the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles, since Yan Zhaoge had already left the Immortal Court, he wasn’t in a rush anymore. Instead, he shifted his target toward Suo Mingzhang and the others, hoping to obtain the whereabouts of Yan Zhaoge and the Awakened Sky Cosmos from them.</p><p>Even the group of Buddhist Bhantes spectating from aside started having different opinions. Some intended to provide aid to the Immortal Court, while some intended to continue watching over the Demon race bigwigs present here, preventing them from giving any form of assistance to the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus.</p><p>The group of Daoism Grand Heavenly Realm experts had a much simpler mindset. Since Yan Zhaoge had accomplished his goal and left the Immortal Court, they didn’t see any more reasons to continue fighting against the Demons and the Buddhists.</p><p>No problems would arise if they left first and slowly made their plans according to how the situation developed.</p><p>As the Demon Race bigwig experts started leaving the battlefield, the initially reserved situation started disintegrating.</p><p>One person alone couldn’t possibly accomplish any grand feat. Hence, the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles could only set his grudges aside and retreated from the battlefield, changing his destination to the Immortal Court.</p><p>On the other hand, the Buddhism Bhantes started obstructing the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles and the other Great Demons.</p><p>However, the new information they received changed their decisions. They shifted their targets and started obstructing the group of Daoism Grand Heavenly Immortals.</p><p>The weird change left Suo Mingzhang, the Incongruence Divine Mother, and the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor confused. Doubts started arising from their hearts.</p><p>The Immortal Court’s situation seemed extremely dire. No matter how they looked at it, the Buddhas of the Western Pure Lands should be prioritizing their attacks on the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus and the Demon Races’ experts.</p><p>Yet, even when the other Great Demons like the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles were leaving, they turned to stop the Daoism’s experts instead.</p><p><i>Could they have other intentions in mind? Did they want to replicate what Yan Zhaoge did and work together with the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus and the Demon Race to annihilate the Immortal Court’s lineage thoroughly?</i></p><p>It might end up being satisfying. However, with how unpredictable the Elder Lord was before the orthodox Daoism had their own Dao Ancestor presiding over them, the results would be unfathomable.</p><p>Because the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord still exists.</p><p>If he ceased the competition for faith power against the Future Buddha and diverted his attention to other matters, there were far too many things a Dao Ancestor could do.</p><p>“The Western Pure Lands wouldn’t have taken this into consideration.” The Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor said, “They should have other preparations. After all, the foundations of the Western Pure Lands are extraordinarily dense.”</p><p>…</p><p>At that moment, after Yan Zhaoge’s havoc, the Immortal Court was welcoming another tribulation.</p><p>As expected, the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus took advantage of the situation and started another ruthless invasion.</p><p>As the Immortal Court forcefully defended against it, they felt powerless.</p><p>Not only because they lacked experts like the Great King of Inspiration, but the most crucial factor was also the fact that the Immortal Courts’ supply of treasured lights imbued with faith power was declining, causing these Immortal Court Immortals to grow weaker and weaker gradually.</p><p>The previously stable frontlines started shaking.</p><p>In the void’s boundless outskirts outside of the Immortal Court’s cosmos, the Western Pure Lands’ orthodox Buddhists and the Astro Mountains Starry Seas’ Great Demons had established another battlefield as well.</p><p>Very quickly, billowing Demonic qis surged. The group of Great Demons reinforcements arrived, with the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles in the lead.</p><p>After holding in a stomach full of rage the entire time, the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles instantly started his massacre.</p><p>Without any reinforcements, the Buddhism’ Bhantes could only withstand their attacks with difficulty. In fact, they were slowly showing signs of retreat.</p><p>Without their aid, the Immortal Court couldn’t possibly hold their grounds.</p><p>However, at that very moment, glazed Buddha lights suddenly shone within the void. Divine flashes of brilliance of five different colors loomed within the Buddha light and circulated without rest.</p><p>Being one of the few bigwigs within the Demon Race, the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles’ face instantly turned ugly.</p><p>When the others present saw that phenomenon, all of them instantly thought of a name.</p><p>The vagrant bigwig of the Ancient era – Kong Xuan, also known as Buddhism’s Mahamayuri!</p><p>With his five-colored divine flashes of brilliance, he managed to triumph over countless experts during the Ancient Investitures of the Gods era’s grand warfare, causing even Daoist Lu Ya and the Dipankara Archaic Buddha to retreat from his fearsome attacks.</p><p>Even a Dao Ancestor – Daoist Zhunti was also devoured by his five-colored divine flashes of brilliance. However, being incapable of withstanding the pressure of the Dao Realm, Daoist Zhunti managed to escape quickly and subdued Kong Xuan. As a result, Kong Xuan entered Buddhism through the Gautama Buddha.</p><p>However, at that time, his opponent was a Dao Realm bigwig. Those beneath the Dao Realm had to be extra careful when facing these five-colored divine flashes of brilliance.</p><p>Among the Grand Heavenly Realm experts, barely anyone could withstand Kong Xuan’s five-colored divine flashes of brilliance.</p><p>“Why have you come out of seclusion?” Asked the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles in a deep tone, “Haven’t you been staying neutral the entire time?”</p><p>Within the glazed brilliance, the five-colored divine flashes of brilliance were circulating. The silhouette of a Buddha then emerged from within.</p><p>“I hath been bestowed with the opportunity of attaining dao. Hence, I shall take side just this once.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
