If a mistake was made, it could result in him being decapitated.</p><p>The Pouch Sac Arhat used this opportune timing and suddenly approached Yan Zhaoge’s back with lotuses blooming from wherever he stepped through.</p><p>After that pouch opened, the murky space within prevented one from gauging what was inside.</p><p>Its effects were like Wuzhuang Temple’s supreme martial art – the Heaven Earth Within Sleeve. Naturally, the Pouch Sac Arhat was much weaker than the Primordial Suppressing Immortal of the Grand Heavenly Realm. However, among other Grand Virtual Realm experts, his techniques were considered top-notch among all others.</p><p>If an opponent of the same realm were warped within his pouch, they would lose themselves within, unable to escape its restraints.</p><p>However, a turquoise radiance flickered within Yan Zhaoge’s eyes, as if he had already expected the Pouch Sac Arhat’s actions.</p><p>When the Pouch Sac Arhat reached his back, his empty left hand was already raised highly.</p><p>When the Pouch Sac Arhat intended to entrap him within, his left hand was already pierced into the pouch.</p><p>Flows of qis wreathed around Yan Zhaoge’s left hand, which held the semblance of an axe and a halberd.</p><p>In the next moment, these flows of qis exploded in all directions, with Yan Zhaoge’s left hand as their center of explosion!</p><p>A further transformation in the Heaven Splitting Halberd.</p><p>Chaos Disintegration!</p><p>The strength used to establish the primordial gulf and the progenitor of all creation!</p><p>Breaking the chaos apart, harnessing creation from nothingness. As the cosmos expanded, all myriad beings came to life.</p><p>As the horrifying flows of qis expanded outward, it shattered the convoluted space existing within the Pouch Sac Arhat’s pouch!</p><p>Amidst the chaotic havoc, elements of earth, water, fire, and wind surged everywhere and finally created an explosion.</p><p>However, with Yan Zhaoge’s Chaos Disintegration, the havoc of elements stabilized swiftly.</p><p>From a stable state to havoc and reverting from havoc to steadiness. A new world and a new set of rules were set in stone just like that.</p><p>However, this set of rules weren’t determined by the Pouch Sac Arhat.</p><p>Breaking out of the old testaments and welcoming a brand new future. Since a new world was born and a new era was established, all that was old shall be buried and destroyed by history.</p><p>With a “rip” sound effect, the Pouch Sac Arhat’s pouch was torn apart by Yan Zhaoge’s strength!</p><p>The Pouch Sac Arhat chanted the Buddhist doctrine softly. After retracting his broken pouch, he quickly retreated.</p><p>However, at the same time, a palm suddenly appeared behind his back.</p><p>The palm remained silent the entire time as if it had been hiding within the bleak darkness.</p><p>Before the palm could approach the Pouch Sac Arhat, a blinding brilliance shone within the sunless void, shining even more brilliantly than the solaris sun.</p><p>The majestic force landed on the Pouch Sac Arhat’s body, instantly shattering his Golden Body into pieces.</p><p>It was Gao Han’s attack.</p><p>The Pouch Sac Arhat left Gao Han aside and turned to attack Yan Zhaoge. This was undoubtedly the same as giving Gao Han free reign of the situation.</p><p>The Pouch Sac Arhat dared to do so because the Sarvanivaranaviskambhin Bodhisattva was around to hold Gao Han back.</p><p>There was no need for verbal communication and only requiring chemistry with each other.</p><p>The Sarvanivaranaviskambhin Bodhisattva could not protect the Ear Digging Arhat, but he couldn’t be bothered with his remorse in this situation. Upon seeing the Pouch Sac Arhat’s movements, he quickly transitioned to holding Gao Han back.</p><p>However, the low-profile Gao Han raised the Holy Radiance Banner that he had never taken out before, nullifying the Sarvanivaranaviskambhin Bodhisattva’s lotus and Cintamani Pearl.</p><p>Then, Gao Han imprinted his palm’s strength onto the Pouch Sac Arhat’s back. It went from churning darkness into a blinding brilliance and reverted to its state of darkness.</p><p>The Pouch Sac Arhat was originally activating the profundities of the Samudaya-satya [1]. It unleashed all sorts of Buddhism defensive supreme martial arts to nullify Gao Han’s attacks and conceal the sense of pain and frustration he felt.</p><p>However, Gao Han suddenly transformed his sun into a Ketu, his glaring brilliance transforming into an eerie, gloomy darkness. As the Pouch Sac Arhat retracted his Samudaya-satya into his body, Gao Han’s sinister spectral power followed along with it. The spectral power infested deeply within the Pouch Sac Arhat, making him unable to put up any defense.</p><p>At the same time, after Gao Han’s Holy Radiance Banner nullified the Sarvanivaranaviskambhin Bodhisattva’s pearl, the Bodhisattva immediately changed his technique, swapping his Bodhi intelligence into Waspish Eyes of Devarajas. Then, using the overwhelming force Devarajas utilized to subjugate Devils, his palm came striking toward Gao Han.</p><p>Gao Han’s entire figure seemed to have been enshrouded within endless darkness.</p><p>From Yan Zhaoge’s perspective, this resembled the scene where the Exalted Concealed Luminary – Yang Ce revived and even attained the Duo Flowers Converged Crown, reaching the Virtual Immortal Peak Realm.</p><p>The Pouch Sac Arhat’s defense was broken through by Gao Han, and in return, had his entire body tarnished with Gao Han’s strength. Meanwhile, a considerable portion of Sarvanivaranaviskambhin Bodhisattva’s attacks were also nullified by Gao Han.</p><p>While Gao Han’s figure swayed after being hit by the Sarvanivaranaviskambhin Bodhisattva, he was all fine and dandy.</p><p>After damaging the Pouch Sac Arhat even further, causing him to lose his fighting prowess, Gao Han’s aura changed once again.</p><p>Within the unending darkness, brilliance shone once again. Gao Han turned around, and his palm clashed against the Sarvanivaranaviskambhin Bodhisattva’s Devaraja techniques, forgoing his passive stance in the process.</p><p>As Yan Zhaoge’s Chaos Disintegration tore apart the Pouch Sac Arhat’s pouch, the Nine-Headed Bug infuriated.</p><p>Three crowns converged atop his head. With a bellow, the Nine-Headed Bug kept his Crescent-Moon Shovel away and transformed!</p><p>The Demon Race Great Sage manifested his true form, transforming into a nine-headed bird whose figure overshadowed the skies. All nine of his heads bellowed in unison, causing the surrounding stars to plunge from their orbits, creating a meteor shower-like phenomenon within the cosmos.</p><p>Countless gusts of gales swept through the surroundings, rampaging through the entire void.</p><p>A turquoise radiance flickered within Yan Zhaoge’s eyes, sketching a rune whose meaning was unfathomable.</p><p>Wielding the Immortal Extermination Sword in his hand, Yan Zhaoge’s sword-art suddenly changed, pushing his control over this ancient sword to the maximum.</p><p>The dense-green sword-lights intertwined together, manifesting one after another sword formations to obstruct the gales.</p><p>To a large majority of Grand Virtual Immortals, the creation of each sword formation would deplete an immense amount of strength.</p><p>However, as someone who learned so many different supreme martial arts and had such a sturdy accumulation backing him up, Yan Zhaoge remained unfazed despite facing such horrifying depletion. His timing of attacks was meticulous as well, not allowing the Nine-Headed Bug to find any weaknesses.</p><p>On the other side, Yan Di’s fight against the Hundred Eyed Demon Lord had reached its pioneer of intensity.</p><p>As the dense yellow radiant mists continued serving as a defense, Yan Di’s saber was still descending, gradually approaching the Hundred Eyed Demon Lord.</p><p>While its speed was slow, no hesitation was sensed from its momentum, and there was no way to reverse its trajectory.</p><p>The Hundred Eyed Demon Lord decisively abandoned his defense and waved his sword, causing a yellow and murky river of sword-qis to slash toward Yan Di.</p><p>As the obstruction disappeared, Yan Di’s saber became quicker as well and came slashing toward the Hundred Eyed Demon Lord.</p><p>The two used offense against the offense, seemingly resulting in an internecine situation.</p><p>The situation was just like the previous battle between the Hundred Eyed Demon Lord and Feng Yunsheng.</p><p>The Hundred Eyed Demon Lord’s heart was filled with dread and helplessness. Before the fight began, he never expected himself to be cornered to this degree.</p><p>Most infuriatingly, while Yan Di’s figure was rendered immobilized after being engulfed by his gold radiances and yellow mists, a colorless lotus still bloomed atop Yan Di’s head.</p><p>The lotus, whose periphery was blurry and resembled the nebula, had its petals unfolding gracefully, layer by layer.</p><p>As the Hundred Eyed Demon Monarch’s sword-qis came slashing toward Yan Di, they were received by the Grand Simplicity Splendour Cloud. After rotating in mid-air for a while, the Hundred Eyed Demon Monarch’s sword-qis seemed to have entered a vast and boundless ocean. They disappeared completely without a trace, not allowing him to harm Yan Di at all.</p><p>On the other hand, Yan Di’s saber-lights had already reached the top of the Hundred Eyed Demon Monarch’s head!</p><p>The Hundred Eyed Demon Monarch watched with widened eyes as Yan Di’s attack approached. Fortunately, the Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva’s protection arrived once again. His white flame-like Buddha lights of blinding brilliance descended, obstructing Yan Di’s saber from progressing any further.</p><p>Only, being distracted by this turn of events, the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor’s lightning immediately surrounded the Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva.</p><p>[1] 2nd of the Four Noble Truths, the cause of suffering</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
