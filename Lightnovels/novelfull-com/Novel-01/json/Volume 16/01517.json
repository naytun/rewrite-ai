I’ll find something to do on my own.” Wang Guan yawned and continued speaking in a slothful manner.</p><p>Percussion Heavenly Lord’s expression became stern, “Your worries are plenty reasonable. If that’s the case, I shall follow you.”</p><p>Being in their current cultivation realm, even if they hadn’t experienced it personally, they definitely wouldn’t underestimate the Immortal Extermination Formation.</p><p>The most ruthless formation in history. This title alone was already self-explanatory.</p><p>If a ranking were given to all the Grand Heavenly Realm experts throughout the entire span of history, then the Great Sage Equalling Heavens, the Jade Eminent Heavenly Lord Emperor, and Mahamayuri would be listed among the top-three rankings.</p><p>As for their placing among the top three ranks, it was still highly debatable. However, other Grand Heavenly Realm experts had little to no hopes for barging into said rankings.</p><p>This included the Dipankara Archaic Buddha, Daoist Lu Ya, Primordial Heart Devil, Taiyi Nirvana Heavenly Lord, the Primordial Suppressing Immortal, the Purple Tenuity Emperor, and many other famous experts whose names were well-renowned throughout history.</p><p>Only one exception existed.</p><p>The Prime Clear’s very first disciple – the Lord of Plentiful Treasures!</p><p>He wielded the Immortal Extermination Four Swords and was proficient in the Immortal Extermination Formation. Him alone could replace his master – the Lord of Numinous Treasures to lay down the Immortal Extermination Formation. If he were given a chance to do so, even if the Jade Eminent Heavenly Lord Emperor or Mahamayuri entered his formation, they would only end up perishing.</p><p>Even the Great Sage Equalling Heavens had little to no chance of withstanding it.</p><p>The reason why it was still debatable was that the Lord of Plentiful Treasure’s battle prowess would become inferior to the Great Sage Equalling Heavens and the others if the Immortal Extermination Formation were excluded.</p><p>In fact, during the Ancient era, the Lord of Plentiful Treasure wasn’t the one with the highest cultivation in the Prime Clear lineage.</p><p>The strongest successor of the Prime Clear Lord of Numinous Treasure was the Golden Spirit Mother.</p><p>However, something worth mentioning was that after the Lord of Numinous Treasure had transcended during the Ancient era, the Lord of Plentiful Treasure had inherited his Chaos Extinguishing Origin Scripture. As a result, he received a massive increment in strength.</p><p>When entering the Middle era, the Lord of Plentiful Treasure who had cultivated the Chaos Extinguishing Origin Scripture had thoroughly surpassed the Golden Spirit Mother. Moreover, even with an incomplete set of the Immortal Extermination Swords, he could lay down the incomplete Immortal Extermination Formation on his own.</p><p>Such strength sufficed in shaking the Great Sage Equalling Heavens positions, the Jade Eminent Heavenly Lord Emperor, and Mahamayuri’s position for the top three.</p><p>Unfortunately, these were all theoretical guesses. Little to none saw the Lord of Plentiful Treasure in his prime form.</p><p>Immediately after he dealt with the Jade Clear’s Master Red Essence, and reclaimed back the Immortal Slaughtering Sword, the Lord of Plentiful Treasure had perished by the hands of the Dao Realm Ancestral Devil – the Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil. In the end, none of his tales were left to be told during the Middle era.</p><p>After transitioning into the Middle era, everyone could only guess the Lord of Plentiful Treasure’s strength. No one could ever come to a conclusion.</p><p>However, the Immortal Extermination Formation’s mightiness was undeniable, leaving no room for others to doubt its prowess.</p><p>“The heretics had already acquired an Immortal Slaughtering Sword and even acquired the complete Immortal Extermination Formation blueprint. If they do acquire the other three swords, that would indeed be worrying.” Percussion Heavenly Lord’s expression turned stern.</p><p>Wang Guan’s eyelids seemed to be struggling to open. He lazily waved his hand, “That’s just my guess. Whether they can locate the swords or not is a different matter. If it’s so easy to find them, they would’ve been discovered long ago. Do they even have to wait until now?”</p><p>He yawned, “I only thought about this matter because the Immortal Slaughtering Sword and the Immortal Extermination Formation’s blueprint appeared and decided to give it a shot. After all, I feel like the fiends from the White Lotus would also have thought about this matter.”</p><p>Percussion Heavenly Lord continued to remain silent.</p><p>On the other side, the Red Inferno Dhvaja Potentate Buddha quietly said, “There are already four Daoism Grand Heavenly Immortals. Although they aren’t all from the Prime Clear lineage, the Immortal Extermination Four Swords aren’t required to lay down the formation.”</p><p>“Some hostilities exist between them. Moreover, only with all four swords would they be able to exert the formation’s prowess to the max.” Wang Guan chuckled and said, “If we acquired the swords, we could even think up ways to counter their plans.”</p><p>Red Inferno Dhvaja Potentate Buddha and Percussion Heavenly Lord nodded. Then, Percussion Heavenly Lord finally said, “With the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord around, we would ultimately maintain our advantage over the heretics. Right now, we have to beware of the White Lotus fiends and the Demon Race.”</p><p>“Red Inferno Dhvaja Potentate Buddha, we’ll have to burden you with the task of watching over the Astro Mountain Starry Seas. I shall search for the Prime Clear swords together with Daoist Wang. As for the matters regarding the Eastern Extremity Viridescent Splendour Emperor, other brethren of mine would look into it.”</p><p>Wang Guan didn’t bother commenting any further, “Whatever, I don’t mind either.”</p><p>“That’s settled then.” The Red Inferno Dhvaja Potentate Buddha smiled and bid his farewell.</p><p>After this Buddha riding a green lotus left, Percussion Heavenly Lord watched his figure disappear and remained silent.</p><p>“The heretic’s Golden Body of the Great Sage seemed to have exceeded the Western Pure Lands’ expectations as well.” Wang Guan’s drowsy voice resounded, “Perhaps, only a few Dao Realm bigwigs were aware of it. As for who, we can’t be sure about it.”</p><p>Percussion Heavenly Lord snorted, “Ignoring the others, how could the Victorious Fighting Buddha not be involved in this matter? While the Western Pure Lands are our allies now, who knows what they’re planning in secret?”</p><p>“I got wind that they seemed to be in contact with the heretics as well.” After pausing for a moment, Percussion Heavenly Lord said in a deep tone.</p><p>Wang Guan smiled, “After all, some Buddhists had originated from the heretics, who then attained Buddhism enlightenment. It’s not impossible for them to still have connections with the heretics.”</p><p>“You’re right. During the time period where we fought against the White Lotus’ fiends, the heretics’ strength had expanded far too great.” Percussion Heavenly Lord coldly said, “If it weren’t for them causing a ruckus, we wouldn’t have been forced into such a passive stance, where we could only await the White Lotus’ fiends to invade us.”</p><p>Wang Guan smiled lazily and didn’t bother adding anything else.</p><p>“You said that someone of the White Lotus possessed the clues toward the Prime Clear Swords. Could it be…” Percussion Heavenly Lord decided to change the topic.</p><p>“That’s right. The past Sword Buddha’s successor – the Sword Master of the Six Paths, also known as the new-generation Sword Buddha.” Wang Guan yawned, “I’ve brawled against him for so many years. Heh, by right, Yin Shiyang should’ve been the one dealing with him. I’m not even that proficient in the ways of the sword.”</p><p>Percussion Heavenly Lord frowned for a moment, sinking himself deep into thoughts, and said, “Let’s not waste our time on this blabber. Let’s depart now.”</p><p>Wang Guan nonchalantly nodded and turned around, flying out from the Immortal Court’s Heavenly Palace. Percussion Heavenly Lord then followed after him.</p><p>The news of the Incongruence Divine Mother searching for the Taiyi Nirvana Heavenly Lord caused an upheaval, affecting not only the Immortal Court and the Western Pure Lands.</p><p>An upheaval was also surging in the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus.</p><p>In the Blessed Lands, a white lotus bloomed atop a treasured mountain within a Land of Buddhism.</p><p>A man was sitting atop the lotus. While he wore monk attire, his long hair remained. His hair wasn’t tied up and was let down across his back.</p><p>His eyes were closed, and he sat in a lotus position. A sheathed longsword was placed horizontally on top of his knee.</p><p>At that moment, another white lotus descended from the sky, landing upon this Blessed Land of Buddhism.</p><p>The long-haired man opened his eyes and looked at the visitor. Atop the white lotus sat another Buddha.</p><p>“What hath the Grand Saint of Nine Spirits said?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
