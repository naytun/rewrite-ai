He was a stranger to the inhabitants of the Jade Spring World.</p><p>However, Yan Zhaoge and the others were much familiar with him compared to the previous generation Sword Buddha.</p><p>The Sword Master of the Six Paths – Qu Su. The previous generation Sword Buddha’s disciple, also known as the new generation Sword Buddha!</p><p>Currently, he was among one of the strongest existences within the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus’ higher-ups. He could even contend against orthodox Buddhism’s Grand Heavenly Realm experts.</p><p>“Master, it’s great that thou art unscathed.” After appearing, Qu Su stood up from the white lotus and pressed his palms together, saluting toward the Sword Buddha, “Forgive me, for I have been late for decades.”</p><p>As he spoke, he took the longsword out of his sheath.</p><p>Six-colored sword-lights glittered, its radiance resembling a wheel.</p><p>As the sword-lights circulated, space seemed to have become distorted, and sentient objects and existences turned ethereal. As sword-lights circulated, they all automatically entered the sword-light.</p><p>Gao Qingxuan frowned. She pointed the Immortal Slaughtering Sword forward, causing dark threads to writhe around the ancient sword.</p><p>Even with the Immortal Slaughtering Sword’s ruthlessness, Gao Qingxuan’s mind still went into a slight daze upon being pulled in by Qu Su’s sword-light.</p><p>An illusory world appeared in front of her, giving off a strange and bizarre feeling.</p><p>The six paths of samsara were being displayed. Gao Qingxuan felt as if she was being inserted into one of them.</p><p>It was a pitch-black, sanguinary, and ruthless path. It made one frenzy with killing intent, giving them the strong desire to obliterate everything in their wake.</p><p>It was the Infernal Realm.</p><p>“The new-generation Sword Buddha who surpassed his own master…” Gao Qingxuan focused on herself, forcefully stabilizing her state of mind.</p><p>The Sword Master of the Six Paths – Qu Su. While the origins of his Buddhism sword cultivation came from the previous generation Sword Buddha, he had established a brand new path using the Sword Buddha’s Samsara Sword Manual as his foundation.</p><p>Contrary to the Sword Buddha transforming into the six paths of samsara, Qu Su extracted himself from within and placed his opponents into his cycle of samsara.</p><p>The higher his opponent’s accumulation of karma, the stronger Qu Su’s attacks will become. As such, he had the glorious record of defeating foes stronger than him, not allowing anyone to underestimate him in the slightest.</p><p>When facing someone weaker than him, his sword’s mightiness wouldn’t show its exceptional side. However, to those weaker than him, he just had to oppress them using his strength. Those marvelousness in his attacks were all unnecessary.</p><p>Since Gao Qingxuan wielded the Immortal Slaughtering Sword, and there were other strong foes aside, Qu Su refrained from oppressing his opponents.</p><p>However, even so, if Gao Qingxuan didn’t handle his attack well enough, her soul would instantly be sent into the samsara of six paths, instantly resulting in her perishment.</p><p>The Immortal Slaughtering Sword was one of the world’s most ruthless weapons ever to exist. It incited countless genocides, accumulating a dense amount of karma in the process. Just by touching it, one would almost instantly be pulled into the Infernal Realm.</p><p>Gao Qingxuan narrowed her eyes, and the negative emotions like bloodlust and frenzies were hidden away.</p><p>Rays of sword qi permeated from the Immortal Slaughtering Sword, expanding toward the outside.</p><p>It wasn’t just limited to the Immortal Slaughtering Sword Manual’s sword intent. Even all the other Immortal Extermination Four Sword’s sword intents were leaking from within.</p><p>Under the tremble of Gao Qingxuan’s sword-lights, all four Immortal Extermination Swords were unleashed together. While they weren’t comparable to the Chaos Extinguishing Origin Scripture, doomsday phenomena were still shown. A specious battle array seemed to have been laid down, with insights of doomsday’s obliteration faintly leaking from within.</p><p>With the Immortal Slaughtering Sword in her hand, the pure Immortal Slaughtering Sword Manual could display its might to the fullest.</p><p>However, Gao Qingxuan decisively changed her attack to prevent Qu Su’s sword intent from devouring her into the Infernal Realm.</p><p>When purely using the Immortal Slaughtering Sword Manual, it would just unleash the mightiness of the Immortal Slaughtering Sword.</p><p>Now, Gao Qingxuan was using the ancient sword to activate her strength.</p><p>Gao Qingxuan’s vision, judgment, control, and self-confidence were in full display with this attack.</p><p>The not-so-bright sword-light swept through all directions, bringing about a turbulent momentum.</p><p>In the dead silent Infernal Realm, scorching lavas were leaking everywhere. As the aura of death spread through the area, cracks started appearing in the Infernal Realm.</p><p>Hell itself seemed to be welcoming its end.</p><p>After the powers of the Infernal Realm dispersed, the samsara of six paths reappeared.</p><p>However, under the influence of Gao Qingxuan and her Immortal Slaughtering Sword’s sword-light, they followed after the Infernal Realm’s footsteps, welcoming the descent of doomsday.</p><p>The Human Realm’s sentient beings were all wailing in agony, just like how they would when the world was on the brink of annihilation.</p><p>In the Animal Realm, all sorts of beasts and pests were rampaging about, with all kinds of beasts bellowing in a frenzy. Similarly, this was also the enactment of doomsday.</p><p>In the Asura Realm, the silhouettes massacring each other in battle became more belligerent and even more stubborn.</p><p>The billions of ghosts in Preta Real turned even more ruthless. Their faces were twisted with much intense pain, and their dense baleful aura made one suffocate just by looking at them, causing chills throughout their entire body.</p><p>Even the self-righteous and venerated saints in the Divine Realm had sunk into a state of shambles. Their clothing turned grubby, their head turned bald, and their entire body reeked with a malodorous scent, just like a mortal reaching their very end.</p><p>All six paths of reincarnation seemed to be heading toward their cessation, welcoming a true doomsday that rendered all of them dead silent.</p><p>The horrifying suction power pulling Gao Qingxuan’s soul was weakened.</p><p>Using this opportunity, she stepped back decisively, dispersing the threat imposed by Qu Su’s sword.</p><p>Qu Su didn’t bother chasing after her. Instead, he said to the Sword Buddha, who had just blocked the Golden Body of the Great Sage’s strike, “Master, refrain from fighting any longer. That is not the Victorious Fighting Buddha’s demonic form, but the Golden Body left behind by the Great Sage Equalling Heavens after being suppressed. More than one Golden Body exists.”</p><p>“ <i>Oh?</i> ” A look of surprise appeared on the Sword Buddha’s face, “Such occurrence is possible?”</p><p>Qu Su said, “Too many weird factors are involved, and they can’t be described that easily. While only one Golden Body of the Great Sage is present, others might still be in hiding. If an amalgamation occurs, they can even harness the Great Sage Equalling Heavens’ true body.”</p><p>“For more information, thou shalt understand them after we return to the Blessed Lands and meet the Maitreya Buddha.”</p><p>As he spoke, he unleashed another attack.</p><p>Wherever the sword-lights passed through, darkness separated. However, jet-black saber lights shot out from within, causing obliteration to the entire universe. Its sense of ruthlessness didn’t pale in comparison to the Immortal Slaughtering Sword.</p><p>As the saber-light and the sword-light clashed against each other, they were both canceled out, dispersing each other’s effects.</p><p>Feng Yunsheng held her saber flat by her side and quietly stared at the two.</p><p>“Doomsday Heavenly Devil, the saber of extinction, a well-deserved reputation.” Qu Su nodded, while the Sword Buddha frowned at the sight of jet-black demonic qi writhing around Feng Yunsheng.</p><p>Feng Yunsheng stood side-by-side with Gao Qingxuan. Without any hints of fear, they both went up against the two Buddhas from the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus.</p><p>These two Buddhas weren’t like any usual heretic Grand Heavenly Realm experts. They were both strong enough to go against the orthodox Daoism’s Buddhas.</p><p>Even Feng Yunsheng and Gao Qingxuan, who wielded the Immortal Slaughtering Sword, had to remain cautious.</p><p>However, the Golden Body of the Great Sage harnessed by Pan-Pan leaped about, prancing through the entire area, his speed being much faster than the two Buddhas.</p><p>Under the Demon Monkey’s disruptive rampage, the Sword Buddha and Qu Su couldn’t focus on dealing with Feng Yunsheng and Gao Qingxuan.</p><p>Every time the Sword Buddha intended to grab the Immortal Trapping Sword, the Demon Monkey would always hinder his path.</p><p>“ <i>Ji!</i> ” He groaned softly, causing his attack pattern to change suddenly.</p><p>The meteor shower-like sword-lights dispersed in an instant, the radiances disappearing into nothingness.</p><p>The Sword Buddha himself disappeared along with them.</p><p>The rays of sword-lights transformed into streams of wind current, permeating throughout the entire region.</p><p>The scenery in Yan Zhaoge and the others’ sights changed at this moment.</p><p>It was a scenery of the mundane world. Crowds of people were passing by them, and all sorts of mundane familial affairs were being discussed.</p><p>As they inhaled slightly, all sorts of scents were drawn into their respiratory systems.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
