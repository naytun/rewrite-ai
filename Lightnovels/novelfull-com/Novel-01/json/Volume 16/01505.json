It was Kong Xuan who had attained Mahamayuri’s physique.</p><p>The Roc of Ten thousand Cloudy Miles and him were of the same mother. They were both birthed from the very first phoenix in the universe.</p><p>During the Middle era, when the Demons and Buddhists were fighting against each other, the Mahamayuri had remained within the central Blessed Lands of Saha, taking the neutral stance of not assisting anyone.</p><p>When Daoist Zhunti, also known as the Mystical Mountain’s Maitreya Buddha, transcended, the central Blessed Lands of Saha had transformed into the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus. Since then, Mahamayuri had turned to the Western Pure Lands and remained secluded the entire time, never to appear at all in history.</p><p>In recent years, even when the Demon Race and the orthodox Buddhism re-appeared in the world once again to assist the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus and the Immortal Court, Kong Xuan had never interfered with any sides. As such, many remained doubtful if this Mahamayuri was still alive.</p><p>Even the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles never expected to meet Kong Xuan under such a situation.</p><p>“That Dipankara guy only knows how to scare others off. Brother, you shouldn’t be tricked by him,” said the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles in a solemn tone.</p><p>Kong Xuan said indifferently, “Thy concerns art unnecessary.”</p><p>“If that’s the case, you’re planning on making things harder for us?” The Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles frowned.</p><p>Kong Xuan first said to the group of Demons, “Ye all can just sit here together with me.”</p><p>Then, he said to the Buddhas, “Proceed as you will.”</p><p>As soon as his words got out, the group of Demon Race bigwigs’ expressions changed slightly.</p><p>Meanwhile, the group of Buddhist Bhantes didn’t hold any doubt about his claim. They said in unison, “We heed your decree.”</p><p>As they watched the group of Buddhism experts leaving the universe and headed toward the Immortal Court, the Great Demons present were instantly filled with the urge to chase after them.</p><p>Although Kong Xuan’s name had been well-renowned in history, more than one Demon Race Great Sage was present. Among them even included someone like the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles, someone whose strength was considered exceptional even in the Grand Heavenly Realm.</p><p>The Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles didn’t instantly make his move. Instead, he merely frowned as he stared at Kong Xuan, not uttering even a single word.</p><p>The other Demon Race Great Sages all went to the front!</p><p>They were made up of two groups. One group was previously fighting against the Western Pure Lands, while the other group prevailed after besieging the Nine Underworlds.</p><p>The Small Saints weren’t self-humiliating individuals who would go up against a Grand Heavenly Realm expert like Kong Xuan.</p><p>Even so, the lineup was so terrifying that even if the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles was to go against them, he could only rely on speed to juke his enemies and slowly think of a countermeasure. There was no way he would face this lineup head-on.</p><p>Facing the attacks coming from the group of Demons, Kong Xuan displayed his Buddhistic Dharmakaya [1] and sat peacefully on the green lotus.</p><p>Only, the five-colored divine brilliance surrounding him started becoming clearer and clearer.</p><p>…</p><p>“Mahamayuri came out of seclusion?” Yan Zhaoge was quietly resting by the Sky beyond Skies. After receiving the report coming from the outside, even he was a little surprised.</p><p>After all, during the Middle era, when Western Buddhism descended upon the East to fight for fortune together with the Demon Race, Kong Xuan had never joined their battles. From start to end, he remained in his neutral stance and helped no one.</p><p>In fact, it could be said that through his current emergence, only did everyone else know that Kong Xuan had joined the Western Pure Lands.</p><p>Ever since the Middle era, no news about him was heard. The whereabouts of this Demon Race vagrant bigwig expert was once the mystery that many others paid attention to.</p><p>His appearance made many others relieved.</p><p>Of course, after this sense of relief, they would have to think of countermeasures for him.</p><p>“Ultimately, he isn’t someone that a normal Grand Heavenly Realm can take on.” Xue Chuqing exclaimed with praise within the Pill Hall.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge rubbed his temples lightly, “Yeah. The report we received proved that he truly lives up to his name.”</p><p>According to the report, Kong Xuan alone fought against the group of Demon Race Great Sages, including the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles.</p><p>In the end, the five-colored divine brilliance that rendered all artifacts useless dominated all of them, forcing the group of Demons into retreat.</p><p>The Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles was initially still watching from aside. In the end, he was forced to take action himself.</p><p>His speed was close to the limit of a Grand Heavenly Realm. Even Kong Xuan, someone born from the same person, was inferior to him in terms of that.</p><p>Theoretically speaking, the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles’ persistent and ruthless attacks should’ve taken effect.</p><p>According to the legends during the Ancient era’s Investitures of the Gods, no matter how robust Kong Xuan’s five-colored divine flashes of brilliance were, they still couldn’t fully deal with opponents with unpredictable and swift movements. When facing opponents like this, the five-colored divine flashes of brilliance would end up stagnant, losing sight of its target in the process.</p><p>From a certain point of view, no matter how strong one’s opponent was, being unable to hit them would render the attack useless.</p><p>Under such a situation, their opponents might even take advantage of the situation.</p><p>When excluding the five-colored divine flashes of brilliance, even if Kong Xuan were still outstanding in regards to other arts, he wouldn’t have the qualifications of remaining sanctimonious over other Grand Heavenly Realm experts.</p><p>Of course, Kong Xuan’s five-colored divine flashes of brilliance were far too intense, and almost no one could exploit their weakness. When fighting someone one-on-one, they usually triumph over any opponent Kong Xuan faced.</p><p>However, the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles was the swiftest expert beneath the Dao Realm.</p><p>With other Demon Race Great Sages covering him, he might exploit Kong Xuan’s weakness.</p><p>“However, the Mahamayuri had already achieved Buddhism’s Golden Body, which covered his shortcomings.” Yan Zhaoge’s mouth cracked into a smile, showing his teeth that were being gritted, “His advantages remain as his advantage, while his shortcomings cease to exist any longer. Compared to the Kong Xuan of the past, the current Mahamayuri could truly be considered as the top three Grand Heavenly Realms in history.”</p><p>The Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles was also aware of his brother’s increment in strength after cultivating Buddhism’s Golden Body.</p><p>However, he had never fought against Kong Xuan since then and couldn’t suppress his desire to probe Kong Xuan’s strength.</p><p>As a result, not only could he not deal with Kong Xuan, he even almost perished under the five-colored divine flashes of brilliance. In the end, he could only flee.</p><p>This was the lesson that he learned from his brother – the Prime Clear Feathered-Winged Immortal during the Ancient era. If one fought against Kong Xuan for too long, even a Golden-Winged Great Roc known for their swiftness would be captured by the five-colored divine flashes of brilliance.</p><p>While the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles managed to escape, the other Demon Race Great Sages weren’t as fortunate. More than half were captured, and only a minority managed to escape.</p><p>As for the Demons beneath the Grand Heavenly Realm, they were all annihilated by Kong Xuan.</p><p>“However, if he didn’t manage to capture the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles, and the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles refused to fight with him any longer, Kong Xuan couldn’t do anything about it,” said Yan Di as he was sitting aside, conditioning himself.</p><p>“That’s right. After all, he can’t match the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles’ speed. However, from the looks of it, he’s merely protecting the Immortal Court and preventing the other Great Demons from nearing it.” Yan Zhaoge nodded, “Considering his relations with the Demon Race, he would release the captured Great Demons after the matters came to an end.</p><p>Yan Di frowned, “Kong Xuan appeared unexpectedly and stood his grounds in solitude against numerous experts. However, the Western Pure Lands’ actions are bizarre. Why did they start fighting against our Daoism’s Grand Heavenly Immortals? Are they dissatisfied with their current number of foes, or do they have the confidence to subdue even us together?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge groaned, “Or rather, it seems like they’re holding back Senior Suo and the others. It doesn’t seem like they’re trying to wipe us out along with the Demon Race and the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus. However, with these actions, they must be coveting after something…”</p><p>His gaze was suddenly filled with depth, “If it’s not us, then it should be the World beyond Worlds, right?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
