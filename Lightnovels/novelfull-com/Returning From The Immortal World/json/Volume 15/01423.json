Then, he coldly laughed. “You guys should remember who those Special Abilities Bureau people are, right? I hope, for their sake, that they never come to the Immortal World. Otherwise, if you ever meet them again, we will kill them on sight.”</p><p>Shao Mingzhen replied, “Most of the Elementalists in the Special Abilities Bureau are nearly dead. Long Zhengyu showed his ruthless side and already secretly has the whole country under his control.”</p><p>“You guys did this?”</p><p>Tang Xiu asked.</p><p>Miao Wentang replied, “That’s right. We did this. We chose the main base of the Special Abilities Bureau as our place of ascension. Hehe. Those arrogant fools were full of ignorance and that cost them their lives. All of them, if not most of them, died during our tribulations.”</p><p>Tang Xiu gave them a big thumbs up and praised them. “Nicely done.”</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>Tang Song, who had been next to Tang Xiu this whole time, suddenly raised his voice and said, “Wow! Both of these uncles are impressive!”</p><p>Tang Xiu turned around and saw Tang Song. Then, as if he woke up from a dream, he slapped his head and said, “Look at me now… After seeing my two brothers, I forgot about this little brat! I’ll introduce you. This is my son, Tang Song. Tang Song, greet them.”</p><p>Tang Song laughed and said, “Uncle Miao. Uncle Shao.”</p><p>Miao Wentang and Shao Mingzhen were shocked. They didn’t expect Tang Xiu’s son to be this grown-up already. Both of them stood up, looked at each other, then they each took out an item from their spatial rings.</p><p>Miao Wentang smiled and said, “Tang Song, your Uncle Miao is quite poor, so I’ll use this as a greeting gift! Please don’t dislike it.”</p><p>Shao Mingzhen laughed and said, “I’m just as poor, but a greeting gift cannot be forgotten.”</p><p>“Thank you, Uncle Miao and Uncle Shao.” Tang Song laughed as he took the two items. Although he didn’t lack anything, they were still gifts from his elders.</p><p>After Tang Xiu’s eyes fell on those two items, he immediately reached out his hand and said, “Let me have a look at those two items.”</p><p>An instant later.</p><p>He already took the red bead and blue bead in his hands. Then, after closely examining it, he sighed and said, “Two Heaven’s Beads. One represents destruction and the other represents creation. These two Heaven’s Beads, even in the Immortal World, are very rare treasures.”</p><p>Miao Wentang smiled and replied, “We’re not sure what these are, but these beads are the only thing that we can take out right now.”</p><p>Tang Xiu laughed and replied, “Brother Miao, my children already have quite a few of these!”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Miao Wentang and Shao Mingzhen looked at each other, then immediately started laughing.</p><p>Tang Xiu gave these two Heaven’s Beads to Tang Song and said, “Swallow both of these beads at the same time. One represents destruction and the other represents creation. I hope that you will be able to understand their meanings and have them completely under control. If you are able to do this, then your future accomplishments will not be any less than mine.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Tang Song lightly nodded his head and replied.</p><p>After a few days.</p><p>Tang Xiu already ordered his people to arrange two palaces for Miao Wentang and Shao Mingzhen. Furthermore, he also arranged for many people to serve them. Tang Xiu also gave them ten million Immortal Crystals each for them to use. Of course, Tang Xiu also gave them a bunch of cultivation pills, cultivation techniques, and some weapons for them to use as well.</p><p>After a while.</p><p>He brought ten Supreme powerhouses and began his journey to the Endless Sea. At the same time, all of the intel operation departments had completely turned their attention to the Endless Sea. A large portion of the intel operatives had already either entered the Endless Sea or stayed in the surroundings of the Endless Sea, strictly monitoring all information within that area.</p><p>Endless Sea.</p><p>It wasn’t a violent water body, but rather a place that was full of terrain that was shaped by meteorites. Many different landmasses could be seen, whether they were big or small. Furthermore, those meteorites would come at unexpected times and explode upon landing on the landmasses. The meteorites in the outer regions were smaller, so the dangers were extremely low. However, the meteorites within the inner regions were much larger and the landmasses were also much larger. And in the depths of the Endless Sea existed an impressive small-scale Immortal Domain.</p><p>Energy tides.</p><p>If this was in the starry skies, then they would be the harbinger of death for countless Immortals. However, in the Endless Sea, energy tides protected the landmasses from being struck by the meteorites. Wherever there were energy tides, meteorites would not land there. Therefore, energy tides were a safe haven for those in the Endless Sea.</p><p>There were countless treasures and wealth within the Endless Sea. The wealth and resources were mainly left behind by the Immortals who had ventured here. After a while, the number of Immortals who came here accumulated and naturally, the number of deaths because of the meteorites also accumulated accordingly. In the end, the Endless Sea became a paradise for the risk-takers.</p><p>“We’re here.”</p><p>Next to Tang Xiu were Seaway Monarch and Nether Sea Whale King. As for the other eight Supreme powerhouses, they were inside the Heavenly Abode.</p><p>The Nether Sea Whale King scanned their surroundings and said, “Your Majesty, are we going to enter the Endless Sea directly? Or are we going to investigate the surroundings first? That Shade Demon Zhu Wushou is extremely cunning. I don’t know what he’s planning at all.”</p><p>Tang Xiu replied, “He won’t be able to enter the inner regions of the Endless Sea unless he can enter its depths where the energy tides are protecting the landmasses. He was once a late-stage Supreme powerhouse, so he was able to freely traverse the Endless Sea, but he’s a mere immortal soul now and as powerful as a Celestial Immortal Stage cultivator at most. If he dares to enter the Endless Sea in his current state, he could die at any time. From what I know of his careful character, he will not take that risk so easily.”</p><p>The Nether Sea Whale King replied, “Your Majesty, do you mean that Shade Demon Zhu Wushou will not enter the depths of the Endless Sea and that we just need to look for him in the outer regions?”</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head and replied, “Quite the opposite. According to Shade Demon Zhu Wushou’s intelligence, he would be able to think of the things that we think of. Furthermore, he also has a Perfected Golden Immortal disciple next to him. With that Perfected Golden Immortal disciple with him, he need not be afraid of entering the depths of the Endless Sea. Therefore, once he heard the news that I have deployed my people to the Endless Sea, he would most likely have already entered the depths of the Endless Sea in his search.”</p><p>The Seaway Monarch nodded his head slowly and replied, “That sounds quite logical, Your Majesty. Shade Demon Zhu Wushou is extremely cunning and has many cards up his sleeves. If he wants the Soul Dissolution Ambrosia, then he will most likely enter the depths of the Endless Sea. I have come here previously, so I know the places protected by energy tides. We can search from the deepest areas of the Endless Sea and conduct our search from there. We may be able to find traces of him easily that way.”</p><p>Tang Xiu smiled and replied, “If we rely on manpower alone to search, it would be akin to finding a needle in a haystack. The whole Endless Sea is much too big for us to search. Its area is larger than ten large Immortal Domains combined! Therefore, we need to prepare something. We may not need to go and search for him ourselves, but that he may come and look for us instead.”</p><p>The Seaway Monarch hurriedly asked, “Your Majesty, what do you have in mind?”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded his head and replied, “I have already thought of a plan on the way here. Seaway Monarch, there is a powerful figure in the Endless Sea known as the Tidal Empress. Since you have been here before, have you heard of this person?”</p><p>Seaway Monarch’s facial expression slightly changed, then he bitterly smiled and replied, “Your Majesty, not only have I heard of this Tidal Empress, but I have also interacted with her. This woman is extremely ruthless and cruel. Anyone who wronged her would be constantly pursued and attacked by her as long as you were in the Endless Sea. She’s remarkably powerful and is extremely suited to fight in the Endless Sea. Even a late-stage Supreme powerhouse would find it extremely difficult to kill her in the Endless Sea.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was surprised and said, “You had a run-in with her? Tell us what happened.”</p><p>Seaway Monarch explained, “At that time, because I wanted to catch a flying sky fish, I entered a piece of land that was protected by energy tides. There were countless Immortal Beasts on that land, and they were all very gentle, like domesticated animals. When I entered the place, I ended up meeting the Tidal Empress. Fortunately, the Tidal Empress needed Immortal Crystals and Crystal Essences that day, so she asked me for them. I gave it to her, so she didn’t kill me.”</p><p>Tang Xiu asked, “Is that piece of land her home?”</p><p>The Seaway Monarch shook his head and said, “I’m not sure.”</p><p>Tang Xiu took a deep breath, then nodded and said, “It doesn’t matter whether or not that place is her home. We need to find her. That Tidal Empress has a remarkable innate talent. That talent of hers allows her to control the energy tides. Furthermore, she’s able to use the energy tides to find traces of living energy in her surroundings. If Shade Demon Zhu Wushou is in the Endless Sea, then she can quickly find him.”</p><p>The Seaway Monarch was shocked. “Emperor, do you mean to ask the Tidal Empress to help us? Is this possible? I know this woman very well. She’s as cold as a person can be.”</p><p>Tang Xiu calmly replied, “If I’m willing to give a drop of god blood for her assistance, do you think that she will agree?”</p><p>The Seaway Monarch’s eyes brightened. He nodded and replied, “I think that she will agree to help us. God blood has great benefits for even a Supreme powerhouse, after all.”</p><p>Tang Xiu said, “Let’s go! Let’s go and find her.”</p><p>In the depths of the Endless Sea.</p><p>There was a piece of land that was covered by energy tides. The area of the land was extremely large. Tang Xiu and the rest of them searched the Endless Sea for four years and had finally found it now. When the few of them breached the energy tides and entered the inner parts of the land, they saw countless Immortal Beasts resting there.</p><p>The sights were extremely beautiful. The water was crystal clear, and the mountains soared far above the sky.</p><p>Tang Xiu looked around and didn’t find any traces of an Immortal living here. Then, he yelled, “Tidal Empress! We wish to meet you.”</p><p>“Scram!”</p><p>A furious voice traveled from the top of a large mountain.</p><p>Tang Xiu instantly locked onto the mountain and brought Seaway Monarch and Nether Sea Whale King to the foot of the mountain. He said deeply, “Tidal Empress, I’m the Great Tang Heavenly Emperor of the Great Tang Empire. I have long heard the name of the Tidal Empress, but I have never had the opportunity to meet you personally. This time, I’m here to make a deal with you. I believe that this deal will benefit both of us greatly.”</p><p>“Get lost right now.”</p><p>The cold voice traveled down once again.</p><p>Tang Xiu coldly laughed and replied, “God blood. I have a drop of god blood in my hands. If you have not passed the Divinity Tribulation, I’m afraid that you will need it.”</p><p>“God blood? You have god blood?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
