He remained silent for a short moment while giving a murderous look to Tang Xiu and the others. Then, he snickered suddenly. “The Great Tang Empire indeed deserves its reputation. It’s even more incredible that you have been able to conquer four immortal domains after establishing the empire, Great Tang Heavenly Emperor. Since someone believes that neither side will have many gains from this, there’s no need for us to battle to the death. You can leave now!”</p><p>Tang Xiu grinned as he asked, “May I know Your Excellency’s name?”</p><p>“Morodan,” The Demon Emperor replied with a deep voice.</p><p>Tang Xiu smirked and said, “I shall remember your name. Let’s hope there doesn’t come a day when we meet again, or else, I won’t mind putting an end to you both in soul and flesh at that moment.”</p><p>Morodan smiled sinisterly. “I’ll be looking forward to that day.”</p><p>A few moments later, the nearly hundred pursuers chasing Tang Xiu and the others returned to the depths of Nefas Abyss one after the other. Tang Xiu used a spell to rinse his body clean with water and smiled wryly. “I wasn’t expecting the inhabitants of Nefas Abyss to chase us so frantically for wealth.”</p><p>Old Sycamore sighed. “People will die for wealth, just as birds for food. These aren’t empty words. Some of the experts mingling in the Nefas Abyss reside here because they have offended a powerful enemy in their original world so that they can hide from the enemy’s pursuit. As for the others, they come here to obtain wealth—a lot of these experts are even willing to put their lives on the line to obtain this wealth!”</p><p>Tang Xiu grinned. “No matter what they came here for, we won in the end and were also able to kill to our heart’s content this time. So, it was indeed worth it.”</p><p>Old Sycamore smiled faintly and nodded in silence. The gazes with which the others viewed him, however, were a bit different, because they could sense that even though Tang Xiu hadn’t reached the summit of the Perfected Golden Immortal Stage, the strength he exhibited allowed him to contend with a late-stage Perfected Golden Immortal.</p><p>And even more importantly, he had divine powers and mystic arts in his arsenal that could catch the enemy off-guard. He had revealed an innumerable number of tricks during the battles in the past fifteen days, and each one of them had broadened their horizons.</p><p>“Let’s return.” Tang Xiu grinned and left the Nefas Abyss through the vortex.</p><p>Tang Xiu and the others hastened on their journey back, and within a short half-year, they were just a dozen or so immortal domains away from the Immortal Lyceum. As long as they didn’t run into any problems for the rest of their journey, it would only take them a few more months to return to the Great Tang Empire.</p><p>Right now, Tang Xiu and the others were resting on a planet within the vast void and suddenly saw a dozen or so Golden Immortals pass by them. Their leader, a Perfected Golden Immortal, was a tall and muscular man donned in golden armor.</p><p>“Hurry up, you all. Move your legs faster for me. The earlier we reach the Pristine Immortal Confucianist Sect, the more treasures we will be able to obtain,” the muscular, golden-armored man stated impatiently.</p><p>Tang Xiu raised his head to look at them, and after a short moment of silence, he ordered in a grim voice. “Stop them.”</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Old Sycamore and Eagle rushed towards the Immortals ahead of them momentarily and blocked their way.</p><p>The golden-armored man’s expression changed when he sensed the dreadful aura around Old Sycamore and Eagle, so he flew up immediately and said to them respectfully, “Junior Vermillion Lightpeak greets Seniors. May I ask what command you have for us to have blocked our path, Seniors?”</p><p>Tang Xiu and the others hurried over and arrived before Vermillion Lightpeak. He swept his gaze across the men in the entire group and asked faintly, “I heard that you were going to the Pristine Immortal Confucianist Sect to plunder their treasures just now. Although they are just a second or third-rate sect in the Immortal World, they are not so weak to be bullied by you people, right?”</p><p>The golden-armored man answered respectfully, “Senior, perhaps you aren’t aware that the Pristine Immortal Confucianist Sect is already in a dire state as the Myriad Sword Sect might break through their defenses at any moment now. A lot of treacherous sects from the immortal domains adjacent to the Pristine River Immortal Domain have joined hands with the Myriad Sword Sect after realizing that the Pristine Immortal Confucianist Sect’s doom is nigh near and are now attacking the sect as well.”</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression changed as he asked in a deep voice, “You’re saying that the Myriad Sword Sect has actually initiated a war between sects?”</p><p>The golden-armored man nodded. “Indeed.”</p><p>Tang Xiu took a deep breath and asked, “So, you’re also planning to join the attack?”</p><p>“Well…” The golden-armored man smiled wryly. “I had a grievance with an expert from the Pristine Immortal Confucianist Sect in the past. They bullied me quite miserably with the support of the Pristine Immortal Confucianist Sect behind them. Hence, I’m planning to use this chance to teach them a lesson along with my group.”</p><p>Tang Xiu ordered indifferently. “Kill them all for me.”</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Eagle and Seaway Monarch attacked at the same time and blew that golden-armored man away. As for the Golden Immortals behind him, all of them suffered an attack almost instantaneously, and within a short quarter-hour, Eagle and Seaway Monarch had killed them all.</p><p>“There’s really an explosive increase in strength after reaching the Supremacy Stage.” Seaway Monarch sighed satisfactorily.</p><p>Seaway Monarch had used a few more drops of god blood during the return trip and broke through to the Supremacy Stage successfully. Zenith Venerable and the others were filled with envy when this happened because they were able to contend with Seaway Monarch in a frontal battle previously. Now, though, they weren’t his opponent even if all of them besieged him together.</p><p>Tang Xiu took a deep breath and said in a deep voice, “The Pristine Immortal Confucianist Sect has some relationship to me, so I can’t just watch with folded hands when they are in danger. The Pristine River Immortal Domain is only one immortal domain away from here, so we should be able to reach the Pristine Immortal Confucianist Sect’s territory within four days if we hurry over there.”</p><p>“Understood!” His companions nodded in succession and revealed dense killing intent.</p><p>As Seaway Monarch had broken through to the Supremacy Stage, their battle strength had experienced a qualitative increase, so even if they were walking into a sect war, they didn’t have to be that afraid. They were already planning to unfold a massive massacre once they reached there.</p><p>When Tang Xiu and the others reached the sect doors of the Pristine Immortal Confucianist Sect in the Pristine River Immortal Domain four days later, they saw that tens of thousands of Immortals had already surrounded the Pristine Immortal Confucianist Sect. These Immortals had varying strengths, as much were just ordinary Immortals. At the same time, there were also Earth Immortals and Celestial Immortals present, along with Golden Immortals and Perfected Golden Immortals.</p><p>Northsword Bel Espion, a Supreme of the Myriad Sword Sect, and also the Sect Master, was standing above the Pristine Immortal Confucianist Sect under the escort of a group of Perfected Golden Immortals right now. He gazed at the remaining members of the Pristine Immortal Confucianist Sect standing behind the grand formation and laughed out loud. “I gave you a chance to live, but you didn’t treasure that opportunity, so the only outcome that awaits your sect is destruction now. Here’s a piece of advice from me to you all. Don’t send your ordinary disciples out secretly because my Myriad Sword Sect has already blocked all the routes leading out of your sect. The one hundred disciples that you sent out before have already departed into the afterlife under the swords of my Myriad Sword Sect’s members.”</p><p>Supreme Pristine Spring, the Grand Elder of the Pristine Immortal Confucianist Sect, and also their sole Supreme, had been grievously injured already and was being guarded by the provisional Sect Master, Daoist Pristine Force, right now. He looked at Northsword Bel Espion, who stood on the other side of the grand formation, with hate, as less than half of the original several ten thousand core disciples of the Pristine Immortal Confucianist Sect remained alive now.</p><p>“Northsword Bel Espion, no matter how arrogant you act, you still cannot break through the sect’s defensive protection array within a short amount of time. I feel that you should spend your strength on breaking the array instead of tooting your horn here. All of us will detonate our immortal souls the moment you break through the array so that we can take the Myriad Sword Sect down along with us,” Supreme Pristine Spring said with a bitter smile after wiping the blood off his mouth.</p><p>Northsword Bel Espion’s expression changed slightly, and he scoffed in the next instant. “We will exterminate your Pristine Immortal Confucianist Sect even if we have to suffer a considerable loss in doing so as we absolutely cannot let you scourges remain alive. Eliminating the Pristine Immortal Confucianism Sect is our Myriad Sword Sect’s objective. Therefore, you won’t be able to mislead anyone with your words. Heed my orders, everyone. No matter whether you are members of the Pristine Immortal Confucianist Sect or not, you are friends of our Myriad Sword Sect as long as you are willing to aid us in attacking them. All of you will be able to obtain a share of the Pristine Immortal Confucianist Sect’s wealth once we eliminate these hypocrites.”</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>The tens of thousands of Immortals surrounding the sect bombarded the Pristine Immortal Confucianist Sect’s defensive protection array with their most powerful attacks one after the other. The protection array that was already on the verge of destabilizing began to ripple unceasingly and seemed like it would break at any moment.</p><p>At a distance away from the sect, Tang Xiu took a deep breath and transferred the god’s corpse into his interspatial ring silently and then handed the Heavenly Abode to Zenith Venerable and said deeply, “Return to the Great Tang Empire immediately and tell Apotheon Bella and Obsideum Immortal Father to rush over with all the Perfected Golden Immortals. Make haste now.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Zenith Venerable accepted the Heavenly Abode and disappeared into the far horizons momentarily.</p><p>Time flitted by, and in a flash, 13 days had passed already.</p><p>Tang Xiu and the others observed the circumstances of the Myriad Sword Sect and the Pristine Immortal Confucianist Sect over the past 13 days while hiding far away. The sect’s defensive protection array was really quite formidable, as even though it appeared like it would break down at any moment under the continuous attacks of tens of thousands of Immortals over the past dozen or so days, it had still managed to hold on.</p><p>Boom…</p><p>Northsword Bel Espion laughed madly and ordered as the Pristine Immortal Confucianist Sect’s defensive protection array broke down. “Heed my orders. I’m allowing everyone to slaughter all the members of the Pristine Immortal Confucianist Sect and pillage them as you wish. Feel free to use the vilest methods you possess to eliminate all the disciples of the Pristine Immortal Confucianist Sect.”</p><p>Supreme Pristine Spring smiled bitterly and soared to the skies in the next instant. He took out an immortal sword from within his body and killed all the hundred Immortals charging towards him with a single wave of his sword.</p><p>“You will have to pay a huge price if you wish to exterminate my Pristine Immortal Confucianist Sect! Come, then! We will kill as many of you as possible and then take the rest of you down along with us!” Supreme Pristine Spring bellowed in a rage.</p><p>At a distant place, Old Sycamore wore a cold look on his face as he asked Tang Xiu in a low voice, “Master. When will we begin acting?”</p><p>Tang Xiu grinned. “Right now. Let’s go!”</p><p>In a short quarter-hour, Tang Xiu and the others had silently arrived behind the Myriad Sword Sect and the other forces. Followed by a single order to attack from Tang Xiu, they began massacring the enemies crazily with a thunderous momentum.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
