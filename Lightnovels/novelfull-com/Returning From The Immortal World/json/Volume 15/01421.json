On top of the boat were two middle-aged men, wearing ragged robes and with bodies full of battle scars and injuries. Next to these two people, another person could be seen. This person was drenched in fresh blood and still conscious. He was constantly scanning his surroundings while gritting his teeth in anger.</p><p>“Damn, it totally wasn’t worth it!!</p><p>“If these two guys dare to trick me, I will then cut their willies and feed them to the dogs.</p><p>“While passing through nineteen Immortal Domains, I’ve already suffered countless ambushes. I’ve nearly gotten killed so many times!</p><p>“This is the greatest gamble that I’ve done. We cannot lose! Otherwise, I will lose my home, my land, and my countless women… I will lose too much.”</p><p>The young man clawed at his face and looked around. He found that he was no longer in danger. It was then that he was able to finally breathe a big sigh of relief. Then, he moved one of the unconscious males to one side of the boat, then laid down in the boat and gradually grew deep in thought.</p><p>Woosh! Woosh! Woosh!</p><p>Flashes of a group of people suddenly shot towards the boat from afar. In a few breaths, they already appeared on the boat. Their leader, a Perfected Golden Immortal wearing silver battle robes and armed with a weapon, looked at the three people on the boat and asked, “Who are you, people? Why have you chosen to enter the Forbidden Sea instead of passing through using the ocean bridge?”</p><p>The young man stood up, then looked at the Immortal in front of him. Then, in reverence and fear, he replied, “My lord, we did not know that this is the Forbidden Sea. We’re being pursued by our enemies and have managed to escape by coming here. That’s right, my name is Eleven Fingers and I’m from Brightpeak Immortal Domain. These two are my good friends. As for why we’re being pursued, it’s completely because of these two. The reason as to why I have brought them to the Great Tang Empire’s Misty Spring Ocean is to bring them to the imperial city to find the Great Tang Heavenly Emperor. They said that they were once good friends with the Emperor.”</p><p>The Golden Immortal leader suddenly had a weird expression on his face. He hesitated for a second, then asked, “Are you sure that they were once good friends with the Emperor? If you can vouch for them, then I will heal them and escort you safely to the city. However, if I find that you have lied to me, then I will, in accordance with the law of the Great Tang Empire, label you as spies who have attempted to infiltrate our Great Tang Empire. If that happens, then I will kill you.”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The young man was suddenly quite uneasy. Although he was quite strong and was a powerhouse in the Great Ascension Stage, his little bit of strength was simply outmatched by the Immortals in front of him. If…</p><p>Internal conflict ensued within him. In the end, he gritted his teeth and said, “Although I’m not sure if they have lied to me, I will vouch for them.”</p><p>The Golden Immortal nodded his head, then threw out two healing pills. Then, he said, “Give them the pills, then we will leave for the imperial city.”</p><p>Half a day later.</p><p>The Golden Immortal brought the three of them to the entrance of the imperial city. He spoke to his superior, then left.</p><p>“Wake up.”</p><p>The Perfected Golden Immortal powerhouse standing in front of them used a special technique to wake the two previously unconscious men from their slumber. Then, looking at their dazed expressions, he asked, “Who are you, people? How dare you call yourselves the Emperor’s old friends? Do you not know that that is a death sentence?”</p><p>Miao Wentang looked around, then suddenly asked, “Is this the imperial city of the Great Tang Empire?”</p><p>The Perfected Golden Immortal proudly replied, “Of course! In the whole Immortal World, which other city can compare to our Great Tang Empire’s imperial city?”</p><p>Miao Wentang and Shao Mingzhen met each other’s gaze, then laughed loudly. Miao Wentang then hurriedly said, “Quick. Take me to Tang Xiu.”</p><p>“How audacious.”</p><p>The Perfected Golden Immortal’s body suddenly emitted a strong and powerful aura. He immediately silenced Miao Wentang and Shao Mingzhen. Then, he said, “The name of the Emperor is not a name that you insignificant Immortals have a right to say! Just because of your words, I can immediately kill you.”</p><p>“I can prove it.”</p><p>Miao Wentang’s body was completely paralyzed in fear. He feared that this powerful figure was going to kill them both.</p><p>The Perfected Golden Immortal raised his eyebrows and replied, “What proof?”</p><p>Miao Wentang hurriedly replied, “I have a phone in my spatial ring. Within the phone, there is a picture of Brother Tang and I… No. There’s a picture of the Emperor and me. You will understand when you see it.”</p><p>The Perfected Golden Immortal retracted his aura, then replied, “Take out the… phone.”</p><p>Miao Wentang immediately took out the phone within his spatial ring. When he found the picture of him and Tang Xiu, he showed it to the Perfected Golden Immortal and said, “My lord, this is the proof. When the Emperor was still on Earth, we were extremely good friends and were at risk of dying with one another. It’s also him who told us that if we ever traveled to the Immortal World, then we can just find him. He said that we will definitely be able to find him.”</p><p>When the Perfected Golden Immortal saw the picture, he was shocked. He hesitated for a while, then replied, “This is an important matter. I will need to report this to my superiors. You can go and wait at the entrance of the temple in the meantime. If the Emperor wishes to see you, then I will escort you to him.”</p><p>“Alright. Thank you.”</p><p>Miao Wentang thought about it, then hurriedly took out two Immortal Crystals from his spatial ring and gave it to the Perfected Golden Immortal.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>The Perfected Golden Immortal was taken aback, then replied with rage in his voice.</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>Miao Wentang’s face immediately froze up, then started to laugh. “My lord, this is something that we wish to give you for your efforts. I hope that you will not reject it.”</p><p>The expression on the Perfected Golden Immortal’s face immediately lit up.</p><p>A gift?</p><p>Are they bribing me?</p><p>Just two mere Immortal Crystals to bribe me, a Perfected Golden Immortal general?</p><p>Miao Wentang looked at his expression and thought that he hadn’t offered enough. He took out four more Immortal Crystals from his spatial ring, then handed it to the Perfected Golden Immortal. With a smiling face, he said, “My lord, this is all I have. I hope that you won’t reject it.”</p><p>The Perfected Golden Immortal did not take it, but instead, he laughed and replied, “Are you trying to kill me? The Great Tang Empire has an iron law that any officer found taking bribes will be killed immediately.”</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>Miao Wentang paused, then replied, “Tang Xiu brought that to the Immortal World, huh?”</p><p>The Perfected Golden Immortal coldly stared at Miao Wentang, then brought the three of them into the imperial city. After two hours, he finally brought them to the entrance of the temple.</p><p>Inside the palace.</p><p>Tang Xiu was talking to his son, Tang Song. Suddenly, his expression changed. Without moving his head, he asked, “What is it?”</p><p>“Emperor, there are a few outsiders who claim that they are your friends. They even said that…” A Perfected Golden Immortal powerhouse came to deliver the news to Tang Xiu. However, before he could even finish his sentence, he hesitated.</p><p>Tang Xiu frowned and said, “What did they say?”</p><p>The Perfected Golden Immortal powerhouse replied, “They said that they were your brothers from a place that you were in. I think they called it… Earth.”</p><p>Earth?</p><p>Tang Xiu’s expression suddenly changed. He turned around and asked, “What are their names?”</p><p>“Miao Wentang and Shao Mingzhen. As for the other person, he’s a citizen of the Immortal World and their guide,” the Perfected Golden Immortal replied respectfully.</p><p>Miao Wentang?</p><p>Shao Mingzhen?</p><p>Tang Xiu’s face was filled with surprise. He hadn’t even dreamt that they would come to the Immortal World this quickly! Furthermore, he didn’t even think that they would be able to find this place!</p><p>“Tell me! Where are they?”</p><p>“In front of the temple.”</p><p>Tang Xiu held Tang Song’s arm, then cheerily said, “Song’er, let’s go and meet a couple of my old friends.”</p><p>After half an hour.</p><p>Tang Xiu appeared in the hall situated in the front of the temple, then looked at the busy workers and asked, “Where is Miao Wentang and Shao Mingzhen?”</p><p>In the receiving room.</p><p>The young man couldn’t sit still and looked at Miao Wentang and Shao Mingzhen. He hurriedly asked, “Did you lie to me? Bro! Please answer me! I beg you! If you both lied to me, then only death awaits us all.”</p><p>Miao Wentang replied, “If this is the Great Tang Empire that we knew previously, and the Emperor of the Great Tang Empire is Tang Xiu, then we are definitely not wrong. Eleven Fingers, don’t worry!”</p><p>Eleven Fingers replied angrily, “What? Don’t worry? I don’t know where you guys are from, and you still managed to trick me to take you here. What have you experienced during all of this? If it wasn’t because of me, both of you would have already died a hundred times over!”</p><p>Miao Wentang and Shao Mingzhen looked at each other and began to laugh. In the three short years that they came to the Immortal World, they were immediately met with trouble. All their belongings were taken from them and they were also heavily injured.</p><p>After that, they employed many methods to try and get immortal stones and crystals. In the end, they finally managed to build wealth for themselves. However, in the process of doing so, they had offended a Silk pants young master. They only injured him, but the other side kept sending people to chase them. In the end, they could only run for their lives. In these three years, although they had killed a hundred people, they also came close to dying several times. As for Eleven Fingers, he was someone who they managed to trick to join them in their run for survival.</p><p>Miao Wentang began to hesitate and said, “Brother Shao, if we managed to get this wrong, then we’re in trouble, aren’t we?”</p><p>Shao Mingzhen bitterly laughed and replied, “Yep. Definitely in trouble. This is the Great Tang Empire, which looks to be the greatest Empire in the Immortal World. No other forces can topple them. If we offended the Emperor of this Great Tang Empire, then we are only waiting for death.”</p><p>Miao Wentang went silent, then said, “I don’t believe that we’re wrong. It’s not like you don’t know just how capable Brother Tang is. No matter if it’s Earth or the Immortal World, he will definitely make a name for himself. Who knows? Maybe this Great Tang Empire is the same Great Tang Empire on Earth.”</p><p>“Hahaha! Although my parents gave birth to me, it’s Brother Miao who knows me best!”</p><p>The door to the receiving room swung open and Tang Xiu’s bright laughter was immediately heard. Tang Xiu then appeared in front of them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
