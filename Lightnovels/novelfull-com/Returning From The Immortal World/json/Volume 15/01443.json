Would you really prefer  losing your life instead of surrendering to me?” The Sacred Demon  Supreme God made one last attempt to persuade the Golden Peng after  recalling all the years he had fought alongside it.</p><p>“The hatred of clan extermination is absolutely irreconcilable, so stop dreaming of it!” The Golden Peng responded disdainfully.</p><p>“You’ve failed to cherish the opportunity, I obviously won’t leave  you alive anymore.” The Sacred Demon Supreme God gave up on the Golden  Peng after seeing its determination and hacked down fiercely. At the  same time, he closed his eyes in pain.</p><p>In the next moment, a loud clanging sound echoed in Sacred Demon’s  ears, and when he opened his eyes, he found that his colossal blade had  struck the ground and an unfamiliar young man stood before him, while  the Golden Peng seemed to suddenly have disappeared.</p><p>The one who had saved the Golden Peng in this critical juncture was  none other than Tang Xiu who had rushed back to the God Realm. After  receiving the Golden Peng into the World Core, Tang Xiu’s gaze turned  frosty when he saw Drunken Immortal, Star Radiance, and the others lying  on the ground with injuries all over their bodies.</p><p>Tang Xiu overlooked the time dilation between the God Realm and  Earth. He hadn’t expected 100 years would have passed in the few days he  had spent on Earth and also didn’t expect so many troublesome events to  occur.</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t dare to imagine how the Great Tang Empire would have ended up if he hadn’t returned to the God Realm in time.</p><p>“Young man. Who are you? And where did you take the Golden Peng?”  Sacred Demon’s cautious nature began to act up after seeing Tang Xiu  stand before him so boldly.</p><p>“My identity doesn’t matter. All that matters is for me to know who  you are.” After observing Sacred Demon for a while, Tang Xiu recalled  his master’s reminder and smiled suddenly. Then, he said the following  words, “I moved the Golden Peng into the World Core I obtained. It’s  severely injured right now, so only the divinity vein inside the World  Core and the spiritual medicines inside can allow it to recover  quickly.”</p><p>“What did you say? World Core? Young man, where did you find the  World Core? Can you let me see it?” Sacred Demon was completely vigilant  about Tang Xiu initially, but after the words “World Core,” he urged  Tang Xiu to let him see it impatiently.</p><p>Tang Xiu casually threw the World Core to Sacred Demon under his tense gaze.</p><p>While Sacred Demon had his complete attention on the World Core and  was just about to touch it, a beam of sword light appeared suddenly and  bisected Sacred Demon’s body.</p><p>“Kid! You have a lot of guts for trying to dupe me!” Sacred Demon  roared in exasperation a few meters above and directed his angry gaze  towards Tang Xiu.</p><p>A young man had actually succeeded in fooling him. If it weren’t for  the fact that he had a divine-grade substitution puppet, he would have  lost his life already. After all the years of ruling in the God Realm,  Sacred Demon had never taken such a huge loss.</p><p>“Duping aside, I will even dare to kill you. Do you believe it?” Tang  Xiu replied to Sacred Demon coldly and used his divine sense to  transfer everyone from the Jade Pool Divine Domain behind him inside the  World Core.</p><p>“It’s been a long time since anyone has dared to talk to me like  this, and those who did so in the past have all died. So, how do you  want to die?” Sacred Demon probed Tang Xiu’s cultivation secretly as he  rebuked him.</p><p>After noticing that Sacred Demon hadn’t taken the initiative to  attack, Tang Xiu immediately understood that the other side was afraid  of his strength.</p><p>The new enmity and the old enmity had accumulated, and even Tang Xiu  didn’t feel like wasting time to talk with Sacred Demon, so he directly  took out the demon-killing divine sword of the Free and Unfettered  Supreme God and surrounded Sacred Demon instantly using the divine power  of incarnation.</p><p>“The divine power of incarnation. Are you a descendant of the Free  and Unfettered Supreme God?” Sacred Demon cried out in alarm when he saw  multiple incarnations of Tang Xiu surround him along with the divine  artifact of the Free and Unfettered Supreme God in hand.</p><p>Sacred Demon didn’t hesitate and contacted the other Supreme Gods in  the Divine Palace immediately. “A descendent of the Free and Unfettered  Supreme God has appeared along with the World Core.”</p><p>It wasn’t that Sacred Demon didn’t wish to hog the World Core. The  reason he had contacted the other Supreme Gods was that he couldn’t see  through Tang Xiu’s strength. Furthermore, he had also sensed the  confidence and killing intent exuded by Tang Xiu’s body. He had  experienced the Free and Unfettered Supreme God’s ambushes and  assassinations multiple times, so he didn’t dare to look down on him and  gave his all even though he was only battling against his descendant.</p><p>After receiving the Sacred Demon Supreme God’s message, the other four Supreme Demons teleported to the battlefield right away.</p><p>After all, the World Core was the collective creation of the twelve  Supreme Gods back then, and possessing the World Core meant full control  over the myriad realms. The World Core had an endless amount of  heavenly laws stored in it and also had all the treasures the twelve  Supreme Gods had gathered from the primogenitor star.</p><p>The World Core was the true Divine Palace in the views of the twelve  Supreme Gods, and the current Divine Palace was just an imitation of the  World Core that they had created after losing the World Core, so its  size and value really paled in comparison to it.</p><p>Therefore, the World Core held an incomparable attractive force to the twelve Supreme Gods.</p><p>When Tang Xiu discovered that all the five Supreme Gods had gathered up, a derisive smile suddenly appeared on his face.</p><p>In the next moment, about 100 Supreme God Puppets were released from  the World Core by Tang Xiu and began besieging the five Supreme Gods  under his orders.</p><p>“Sacred Demon, you won’t die a good death. You were fully aware that  the other side had laid a trap, yet you still summoned us here!”</p><p>“Damn it! Aren’t these the Supreme God Puppets from the Divine Origin  City? Why are they attacking us instead of listening to our orders?”</p><p>“Lord, please stop attacking us! We’re willing to serve you as long as you spare our lives!”</p><p>…</p><p>The five Supreme Gods knew they had no way out of the situation when  they saw the Supreme God Puppets appear and seal their escape routes.</p><p>If they had enough time to prepare, they would have mobilized their  armies and gathered all their combat forces in the Jade Pool Divine  Domain. The Supreme God Puppets brought by Tang Xiu would have had no  use in that case. Unfortunately, Tang Xiu had appeared too suddenly, so  the five Supreme Gods weren’t on guard against him and never imagined  that he actually had so many Supreme God Puppets on him.</p><p>Although the battle strength of a Supreme God Puppet couldn’t match a  real Supreme God, their numbers were too many. About 20 of them were  besieging each Supreme God, and Tang Xiu also kept sending beams of  sword light at them to control their maneuvers, so the five Supreme Gods  could only take a beating passively even though they were strong.</p><p>Tang Xiu ignored the desperate pleas of the five Supreme Gods and  silently ordered the Supreme God Puppets to increase their attacks while  he used the space-time law to disturb the heavenly laws of the five  Supreme Gods and accelerated their defeat.</p><p>The five Supreme Gods stopped pleading after seeing that Tang Xiu was  determined to kill them and began using their special skills,  substitution puppets, battle mounts, divine artifacts, and consumed  medicinal pills to boost their potential to the maximum. They then  targeted Tang Xiu and joined hands to attack him unceasingly.</p><p>Tang Xiu had already comprehended the heavenly laws of the five  Supreme Gods and even experienced their cultivation process while doing  so, and he had also analyzed their personalities clearly, so, all of  their schemes were just harmless, ineffective tricks in front of him.</p><p>This was a battle between the Supreme Gods.</p><p>This was a battle that overturned the seas and rivers and shattered the earth and skies.</p><p>This was a battle that was unprecedented since the creation of the God Realm.</p><p>The five Supreme Gods were forced to reveal all their hidden aces and  display their full strength since their lives were at stake here.</p><p>On the other hand, Tang Xiu was afraid that the five Supreme Gods  would flee and also feared that he wouldn’t find such a good chance to  kill all five of them in the future, so he also gave his all in this  battle. He even didn’t hesitate to detonate the Supreme God Puppets at  some crucial moments just to prevent the Supreme Gods from fleeing.</p><p>A wave of the sword tore the void open.</p><p>A slash of the saber created a chasm.</p><p>A punch of the fist produced a black hole.</p><p>A kick of the leg sundered the earth apart.</p><p>This fierce battle that blotted out the skies continued for five whole days.</p><p>No one knew what this battle was about because everyone who had witnessed it had already turned into ashes.</p><p>Five days later, the Jade Pool Divine Domain and the Sky Jade Divine  Domain had been wiped out from the God Realm and all the domains of the  Marionette Galaxy had almost turned into ruins, with each split into  eight huge sections, reducing the size of the God Realm to a third of  its initial size.</p><p>Tang Xiu finally sighed in relief after confirming that the five  Supreme Gods had truly perished from and didn’t have any traces left in  this world. He only had 27 Supreme God Puppets left now and all of them  were missing an arm or limb, causing Tang Xiu’s heart to ache.</p><p>The five Supreme Gods, however, indeed had a deep foundation and a  plethora of life-saving treasures as well as unstoppable escape skills  and unpredictable assassination skills. If it weren’t for Tang Xiu’s  cautious nature that made him maintain a high degree of vigilance at all  times, it would have been impossible for him to get rid of the five  Supreme Gods altogether, and he might have even died under their  attacks.</p><p>The cheers of everyone from the Great Tang Empire welcomed Tang Xiu  when he returned inside the World Core along with the 27 Supreme God  Puppets.</p><p>Although they didn’t have the strength to participate in this  world-shattering battle, they were able to witness the entire battle  from within the World Core.</p><p>These five days had been an emotional roller-coaster for them, and  even Star Radiance and Bella had fainted from the fear a few times over  this short duration.</p><p>“Master, I thought I would have to wait for several hundred thousand  years before I could avenge the extermination of my clan and might even  have to harbor this grudge for my entire life, but I never imagined you  would avenge my clan in just one hundred years.” The Golden Peng tapped  its head on the ground before Tang Xiu several times to express its  gratitude with tears all across its face.</p><p>The Golden Peng had recognized Tang Xiu as its master only because it  placed importance on Tang Xiu’s growth potential. However, Tang Xiu’s  strength had completely subdued it right now.</p><p>As for the members of the Great Tang Empire, there was no need to  even say anything about them. Tang Xiu had already become someone they  looked up to long ago, but even they had never imagined that Tang Xiu  would become a Supreme God in just a short one hundred years and wipe  out the overseers of the Divine Palace, so they didn’t even know what to  say to him.</p><p>“Senior Golden Peng, although the five Supreme Gods of the Divine  Palace have perished eternally, the Divine Palace has controlled the God  Realm for millions of years, so there’s no doubt that their influence  is deeply rooted in the God Realm. I hope that you can take these 27  Supreme God Puppets to cleanse the entire God Realm and wipe out the  remnant forces of the Divine Palace within the next 50 years. Can you do  it?</p><p>“Senior Drunken Immortal, Star Radiance, Bella. Although the Divine  Palace doesn’t exist any longer, the order of the God Realm must be  maintained. I need you to help me bring order to the realm and enforce  the laws of the Great Tang Empire across the entire God Realm and turn  it into a free, just, prosperous, and peaceful cultivation world. Can  you do it?</p><p>“Old Sycamore, Eagle. I need you to accompany me back to the Immortal  World to select suitable talents and help me maintain the order of the  myriad realms and recover the glory of the God Realm. Are you willing?”</p><p>…</p><p>After recounting the events that led to him refining the World Core  and becoming the Lord of Myriad Realms after gaining a peak-stage  Supreme God cultivation to everyone, Tang Xiu’s expression turned solemn  as a series of commands left his mouth.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
