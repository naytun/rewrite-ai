There’s no doubt that this Great Tang Heavenly Emperor will die, and he might even implicate the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect too. The Inner Pill Sect and Everlasting Palace were strong enough already, but the Ghost Sect has also got involved now. Although others can’t figure Shade Demon Zhu Wushou out, I know he’s quite a troublesome foe. He usually acts pretty low-profile, but he’s probably as strong as Great Emperor Danqing and Zither Demon Jiuyao. The Ghost Sect also has four Supreme powerhouses at the very least, and probably many more than the Inner Pill Sect and Everlasting Palace.”</p><p>A shining object flew into the palace from outside suddenly, and Supreme Purgatory grabbed it immediately. His expression changed greatly when he finished reading the message inside the communication signet.</p><p>“What is it, Arena Master?”</p><p>“Did something big happen?”</p><p>The other four Supreme powerhouses inquired simultaneously after noticing the change in Supreme Purgatory’s expression.</p><p>Supreme Purgatory closed his eyes for a moment, and when he opened his eyes again, all he could do was smile wryly. “We were criticizing the Great Tang Empire just now, but the information I received just now caught me a bit unprepared. Shade Demon Zhu Wushou led six Supremes and dozens of Perfected Golden Immortals to ambush the Great Tang Heavenly Emperor somewhere in the Immortal World. However, I bet no would have imagined the outcome of the battle.”</p><p>“How did it end?”</p><p>The azure-robed old man asked anxiously.</p><p>Supreme Purgatory forced a smile. “The Great Tang Heavenly Emperor also had six Supremes on his side along with a Star Devourer Insect that’s as strong as a Supreme. He suffered grievous injuries from the battle, but two of the six Supremes under him detonated their souls and killed three of the enemy Supremes, and also inflicted heavy injuries on the remaining three. As for Shade Demon Zhu Wushou, he ended up in an even worse state as his immortal soul had to flee after detonating his immortal body.”</p><p>“How could such a thing have happened?”</p><p>“Heavens! How come the Great Tang Empire has so many Supreme powerhouses? The number of Supremes in the Immortal World totals less than a hundred people, yet the Great Tang Empire actually has six of them, and also a Star Devourer Insect on the level of a Supreme. This is a very terrifying lineup.”</p><p>“No wonder he dared to challenge the three super sects of the Immortal World simultaneously. He actually had so many Supreme powerhouses under him. If we consider the two Supremes from the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect, the Supremes on their side wouldn’t number less than the number of Supremes on the enemy’s side.”</p><p>“I wasn’t expecting Shade Demon Zhu Wushou to end up in such a miserable state. This is indeed too unexpected.”</p><p>Supreme Purgatory sighed. “Let me finish speaking first. An unknown woman suddenly appeared in the middle of the battle, and she was the one who saved the Great Tang Heavenly Emperor’s life, inflicting a heavy injury on Shade Demon Zhu Wushou. However, that Supreme also got injured badly because of this.”</p><p>The four men drew in a cold breath of air as they weren’t expecting so many Supremes to get involved in this battle.</p><p>Supreme Purgatory sighed. “Forget it. Let’s see how the situation turns out!”</p><p>Somewhere else in the Immortal World.</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Tianji sat upright on the Golden Imperial Throne and observed the heavens of the distant void with his pupils that had already turned golden and sighed in relief internally.</p><p>“Heavenly Emperor, how does the situation of the battle look?”</p><p>A tall and muscular man donned in white armor with his long hair scattered behind his back asked.</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Tianji smiled wryly. “The Great Tang Empire’s side won with much difficulty.”</p><p>The muscular man asked in disbelief, “Shade Demon Zhu Wushou had six Supremes with him. Even a total of seven Supremes failed to eliminate the Great Tang Heavenly Emperor?”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Tianji remained silent for a long time and then muttered, “I’m already unable to see his fate. But I can predict one thing. An immense and chaotic war will soon occur in the Immortal World.”</p><p>In the Nefas Abyss.</p><p>The Blackface Ghost Emperor observed the virtual image produced by a divine artifact of the ghost race in the 9th layer of Nefas Abyss and muttered, “The imminent war will probably engulf the entire Immortal World in endless turmoil. No matter who wins, the Great Tang Empire, or the three super sects, it would cause chaos in the Immortal World since powerhouses from all realms might pass through Nefas Abyss with the intent to invade the Immortal World.”</p><p>After a short moment, Blackface Ghost Emperor sent out a few communication signets and continued observing the scenes shown by the virtual image before him and waited for the war’s commencement.</p><p>A lot of Supreme powerhouses in all the domains of the Immortal World were similarly keeping an eye on the situation of the war and speculating who would win in the end. However, although they were speculating about it, they were all biased towards the Inner Pill Sect, Everlasting Sect, and Ghost Sect. After all, these elite sects were all super forces and had a huge influence over the Immortal World. Moreover, Inner Pill Sect’s Great Emperor Danqing, Everlasting Palace’s Zither Demon Jiuyao, as well as Ghost Sect’s Shade Demon Zhu Wushou, were all peak-stage Supremes, so they didn’t believe that the Great Tang Empire which only had a history of a few hundred years could win against all of them even if they gave their best in the battle.</p><p>Time fleeted by, and in the blink of an eye, six days had passed already.</p><p>Outside the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect, Great Emperor Danqing revealed an excited expression when he saw the group of Perfected Golden Immortals tasked by Shade Demon Zhu Wushou’s faction to bring the Formation Breaking Talisman appear.</p><p>Millions of experts of the three sects were on standby in the void, well prepared for the imminent battle.</p><p>Inside the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect.</p><p>All the ordinary people of the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect had entered the Heavenly Abodes of the sect’s powerhouses. And all Immortals, no matter which cultivation stage they possessed, had prepared for the imminent battle. The unprecedented war that was about to begin filled them with tension as they waited for the moment that would mark the start of the battle.</p><p>Supreme Star Soul stood before a grand palace and observed the millions of experts from the three sects above in the starry skies, his heart filling with the intent to battle them. He absolutely wouldn’t have felt this way if it were a few hundred years ago and hoped to hold back the enemy with the help of the sect’s protection array.</p><p>However, things were entirely different now. The Vermillion Bird Holy Sect had a lot of experts currently. A majority of their Golden Immortals had broken through to the Perfected Golden Immortal Stage, and a few of the Perfected Golden Immortals had even become Supremes. Moreover, in recent times, a few more Perfected Golden Immortals had managed to become Supremes with the investment of a large amount of god blood.</p><p>As such, the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect had a total of 11 Supremes if Apotheon Bella and Sablefiend Scorpio were included together.</p><p>Supreme Star Soul was confident that the current strength of the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect would allow them to contend with the millions of enemies even without the aid of the Great Tang Empire’s army that his son, Tang Xiu, was bringing over with haste.</p><p>“Sect Master, looking at the situation outside, it seems like they want to storm inside our Vermillion Bird Holy Sect!” As they were present in front of everyone, Star Tears called Supreme Star Soul by his title instead of a familial appellation.</p><p>Supreme Star Soul narrowed his eyes and said slowly, “You’re right. From their actions, it seems like they are really planning to storm inside our Vermillion Bird Holy Sect. I suspect that they must have obtained some method or item that can break the protection array of our sect.”</p><p>Star Tears’ expression changed. “From what I know, there’s indeed an item that can break our sect’s protection array. However, it’s an item of the Demon Realm and not our Immortal World.”</p><p>Supreme Star Soul asked, “What kind of item is it?”</p><p>Star Tears explained, “Supreme Demon Heavenlife Fanatic, an unrivaled expert of the Demon Realm, excels in producing demon talismans, and one of them is known as the Formation Breaking Talisman. All arrays of the Immortal World, other than the powerful divine arrays, and even many of the protection arrays of the elite sects, cannot withstand the Formation Breaking Talisman. We might we forced to battle our enemies if they have obtained this talisman.”</p><p>Supreme Star Soul took a deep break after hearing this and said solemnly, “I believe they must have obtained the Formation Breaking Talisman. Inform everyone to prepare for battle! Also, it’s highly likely that this continent will get smashed into pieces, so we will have to look for a new place for our sect once the war ends.”</p><p>Star Tears smiled wryly. “I fear that the imminent battle will not just destroy the continent but also destroy the entire immortal domain and perhaps even the surrounding ones. However, Xiu’er has already occupied ten immortal domains around the Immortal Lyceum, so our Vermillion Bird Holy Sect can choose a location in one of them.”</p><p>Supreme Star Soul nodded silently.</p><p>Boom…</p><p>A tremendous explosion caused the ears of all the Immortals to slightly buzz in pain, and following that, a small crack gradually appeared on the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect’s protection array under the gazes of ten million Immortals. In just one hour, the crack expanded to the entire array and smashed it into motes of energy, exposing the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect to the millions of experts of the three elite sects.</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>Zither Demon Jiuyao held a zither in his hand as he overlooked the ten million Immortals of the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect from above and laughed out loud. “Imbeciles of the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect, you must have not expected us to break your sect’s protection array, right? Hahaha… Your time of death has finally arrived. Your Vermillion Bird Holy Sect will no longer exist from this day onwards.”</p><p>Supreme Star Soul flew up instantly, his eyes brimming with grim killing intent as he replied fearlessly, “The current Vermillion Bird Holy Sect is no longer the same as before. Zither Demon Jiuyao, are you sure you will be able to destroy my Vermillion Bird Holy Sect?”</p><p>Zither Demon Jiuyao sneered. “Of course. Based on the strength of your Vermillion Bird Holy Sect, we would have already eliminated all of you if it weren’t for the damned array protecting your sect. Although your beloved son didn’t die, he has already become trash and is just an ant in our eyes. I’ll spare your life, and once we are done killing all the people of the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect, I’ll let you witness how I behead your son and use his head as a chamber pot.”</p><p>Supreme Star Soul shook his head and sighed. “I have seen several brazen fellows, but only one of them was able to match their words with their abilities. Forget it, in the end, you are just a fool with some abilities, Zither Demon Jiuyao. Since you are leading this battle, don’t you retreat to the back now. Come have a chat with me.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
