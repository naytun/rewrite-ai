The  shrubs here were almost 1-2 meters tall and it was covered in brambles  everywhere while the mountain rocks were rugged and steep. Just a slight  mishap could cause one’s foot to slip and make them disappear into the  depthless chasm.</p><p>The creatures of the valley were so strong that they could contend  with a Crossing Tribulation Stage cultivator. As such, the place had  become deserted and rarely had any visitors.</p><p>Tang Xiu had only visited the outer sections of the Ghost King Valley  during his previous visit and left quickly after obtaining the Soul  Phantasmagoria Demonic Flower and the Demonic Revival Grass. This was  because the strength of the fierce beasts in just the outer sections of  the Ghost King Valley was as strong as his, so he didn’t dare to enter  the depths of the valley.</p><p>This time, Tang Xiu had come here as a peak-stage Supreme God and as  the Lord of Myriad Realms, so he obviously held no fear at all.</p><p>A few fierce beasts targeted Tang Xiu and surrounded him the moment  he stepped into the Ghost King Valley, but he just glared at them once  and continued walking deeper into the valley.</p><p>The unfortunate fierce beasts thought a delicious prey had come to  deliver itself to them, but they never thought that it was actually the  arrival of their nemesis. The fierce beasts didn’t even have a chance to  howl before their entire existence was wiped out by Tang Xiu’s glare.</p><p>Learning from this event, Tang Xiu didn’t hide his aura anymore and  used his divine sense to manifest eleven incarnations alongside his main  body, and the twelve figures walked into the depths of Ghost King  Valley directly.</p><p>If Sacred Demon Supreme God were present, he would have definitely  recognized them as the auras of these twelve’s heavenly laws and divine  force were actually the same as the group of twelve Supreme Gods headed  by him.</p><p>No other fierce beast dared to block Tang Xiu’s path for the rest of  his journey because of the suppression from his powerful aura.</p><p>An hour later, Tang Xiu reached the depths of the Ghost King Valley  and discovered the aura of a destructive divine force from inside.</p><p>“The 100 Supreme God Puppets? If I obtain these 100 Supreme God  Puppets, wouldn’t that mean I can take over the entire God Realm in an  instant?” Such a thought emerged within Tang Xiu’s mind suddenly.</p><p>“Greetings, Lords!” Tang Xiu had subconsciously crossed the 100-meter  range of the Supreme God Puppets while pondering on the matter, so the  puppets had sensed his arrival as well.</p><p>Tang Xiu commended his wit when the 100 Supreme God Puppets  surrounded him suddenly as he would have definitely entered a fierce  battle with dozens of puppets if he hadn’t made prior preparations.</p><p>Tang Xiu sighed inaudibly after looking at the blank look in the eyes  of the Supreme God Puppets as well as their lifeless bodies. If it  weren’t for the wicked twelve Supreme Gods, these deities would have  certainly become overlords and wouldn’t have ended up in such a  miserable state.</p><p>As Tang Xiu had incarnated into the twelve Supreme Gods right now,  these Supreme God Puppets didn’t show any hostility or vigilance towards  him.</p><p>Tang Xiu passed through the Supreme God Puppets and erased the soul  imprints left behind by the twelve Supreme Gods and replaced them with  his own soul imprints.</p><p>Although it sounded like a simple task, it was a pretty arduous one  since just a slight mishap on his end could ruin the Supreme God Puppet.</p><p>Tang Xiu spent three whole days converting the Supreme God Puppets  into his battle puppets. He was dead tired by now, as erasing a soul  imprint and replacing it with his own were both extremely delicate tasks  and required him to rest and recover for some time to refine just a  single Supreme God Puppet. However, since he was inside the Divine  Origin City, he wasn’t worried about running out of divine origin force  at all.</p><p>“It’s indeed worthy of being called the Divine Origin City. The  divine origin force present here is much denser than the God Realm’s,  and if it weren’t for the array isolating this place, this divine origin  force would have spread to the outside world and made the entire Earth  Realm much stronger than the God Realm.” After coming to the Ghost King  Valley one more time, Tang Xiu had already determined that the three  mountains around the valley hadn’t formed naturally and had been moved  over by someone using divine force and were the key elements of the  array. Furthermore, the main function of the three mountains was to  prevent the divine origin force from flowing outside.</p><p>“Huh? The divine origin force inside the Divine Origin City isn’t  replenishing itself.” Tang Xiu discovered the abnormality quickly. “Is  it because of the missing divinity vein mountain?”</p><p>Tang Xiu felt relieved internally when he recalled that the twelve  Supreme Gods had extracted the divinity vein to create the World Core.</p><p>According to Tang Xiu’s speculation, it was highly likely that the  divinity vein was hidden under the Divine Origin City and was the source  of the divine origin force of the city. The twelve Supreme Gods had  extracted the divinity vein to create a new Divine Origin City, but  unfortunately, Tang Xiu was the one who picked up this windfall in the  end.</p><p>“Since the Divine Origin City and the divinity vein were a singular  entity, it’s time to let them become one again.” Tang Xiu waved his hand  and moved the Divine Origin City inside the World Core and placed it  above the divinity vein.</p><p>As divine origin force was the source of their powers, the Supreme  God Puppets became restless when the Divine Origin City disappeared.</p><p>Tang Xiu chuckled and received the 100 Supreme God Puppets into the World Core as well.</p><p>After he was done with this, Tang Xiu left one of his Supreme God  incarnations on Earth to handle some of the unfinished matters while his  main body returned to the God Realm immediately.</p><p>The reason why he had returned to the God Realm with haste was that  his connection with the Golden Peng was becoming weaker by the moment  and this gave him an ominous premonition. He obviously didn’t plan to  keep staying on Earth since the members of the Great Tang Empire were  all still in the Jade Pool Divine Domain.</p><p>Right now, in the Jade Pool Divine Domain, the Golden Peng’s wings  had been snapped off already and its entire body was crawling on the  ground right now. A sea of corpses laid behind it, and even Drunken  Immortal and the others were covered in blood right now and couldn’t  even put up a resistance.</p><p>“Golden Peng, I’m giving you one last chance. Form a master and  servant contract with me and become my battle mount again, or else, the  ants behind you will all die along with you,” Sacred Demon Supreme God  said impatiently while directing an ice-cold gaze towards the Golden  Peng.</p><p>“Sacred Demon, you exterminated my Golden Peng Clan and deceived me  for several eras. You even kept me trapped for a dozen or so eras, so do  you believe I would join the ranks of a traitor like you?” The Golden  Peng spat out a mouthful of foul blood after hearing Sacred Demon  Supreme God’s words.</p><p>“Since you want to continue acting stubbornly, don’t blame me for  acting ruthlessly.” A vicious glint flashed through Sacred Demon Supreme  God’s eyes as he swung his divine artifact at the Golden Peng.</p><p>The Golden Peng ignored the threat and turned its head towards  Drunken Immortal and the others before saying guiltily, “Forgive me for  implicating you. You still had some chance to live, but you all fell  into danger because of my arrival.”</p><p>After Tang Xiu had left the Jade Pool Divine Domain, Drunken Immortal  and Star Radiance led the members of the Great Tang Empire to quickly  take control of the Jade Pool Divine Domain.</p><p>The number of people that ascended through the Immortal Exuviate Pond  in the Jade Pool Divine Domain kept increasing year by year over the  next 100 years, and these consisted of the people from other galaxies  and the Milky Way Galaxy, which included a lot of members of the Great  Tang Empire.</p><p>Under the supervision of Drunken Immortal, Star Radiance, and the  others, the Jade Pool Divine Domain became more and more prosperous, and  their strength also climbed up like a growing bamboo shoot. Drunken  Immortal had the highest cultivation and had already become a peak-stage  Heavenly God and Star Radiance had also become a Great God, while the  others had also progressed their cultivation collectively.</p><p>However, an unexpected event occurred while the members of the Great Tang Empire focused on progressing their strength.</p><p>The leader of the twelve Supreme Gods, Sacred Demon, was someone from  the Marionette Galaxy, so the Marionette Galaxy had a lot of domains  under its control. The Sky Jade Divine Domain was also the domain of the  Sacred Demon Supreme God, so, as its subsidiary domain, the Jade Pool  Divine Domain was also a domain of the Sacred Demon Supreme God, and all  the important posts of these domains were held by descendants of the  Sacred Demon Supreme God.</p><p>It was the centennial birthday celebration of the Sacred Demon  Supreme God 2 years ago, so all his descendants had sent him presents to  congratulate him. However, after tallying up the presents, the deity  in-charge of counting them found that two presents were missing. After a  thorough investigation, it was discovered that the Peargold and  Pearwood brothers from the Jade Pool Divine Domain hadn’t sent presents  and hadn’t even made an appearance in the celebration.</p><p>The deity in-charge of Sky Jade Divine Domain felt infuriated after  learning this and planned to dispatch the army to capture and penalize  the brothers before the Sacred Demon Supreme God learned of the matter.  However, when the army of Sky Jade Divine Domain reached the Jade Pool  Divine Domain, they discovered that it had changed hands.</p><p>The Jade Pool Divine Domain was on guard about the arrival of the Sky  Jade Divine Domain’s army. They led the army into a maliciously  prepared trap and wiped it out before it could even declare war on them.</p><p>Two days had passed by the time the deity in-charge of Sky Jade  Divine Domain realized something was wrong and the Sacred Demon Supreme  God had already learned that Peargold and Pearwood hadn’t attended his  birthday celebration. However, as he had too many descendants, he wasn’t  bothered by this event and just passed a casual directive to punish the  deity in-charge of Sky Jade Divine Domain appropriately.</p><p>The pitiful deity in-charge of the Sky Jade Divine Domain had his  life reaped by the enforcers of the Divine Palace and, before they could  even figure out where their army disappeared to and once a new deity  took the reins, they launched a full-on attack on the Jade Pool Divine  Domain immediately.</p><p>Although the comprehensive strength of the Jade Pool Divine Domain  was weaker than the Sky Jade Divine Domain, they had prepared well to  secure a victory and were also proficient in the art of war because of  their ample experience. Hence, this battle actually continued for almost  half-a-year.</p><p>The new deity in-charge of the Sky Jade Divine Domain sensed  something was wrong and was forced to retreat through the dangerous  battlefield and reported back to the Divine Palace.</p><p>The Sacred Demon Supreme God became infuriated after learning that  someone had already taken over a domain of his and sent an aide to deal  with the matter personally.</p><p>It was also around this time that the Golden Peng returned to the God  Realm. After showing the token Tang Xiu had given it, it obtained the  approval and trust of all the members of the Great Tang Empire, and its  strength recovered back to the Supreme God Stage rapidly by using the  large number of cultivation resources that the empire had gathered.</p><p>This led to the tragic end of the people from the Sacred Demon  Supreme God’s faction who had arrived in the Jade Pool Divine Domain to  deal with the issue, with each subsequent one welcoming their death.</p><p>The Golden Peng would have already led the Great Tang Empire to  conquer the Sky Jade Divine Domain if it weren’t scared of the  possibility of the Sacred Demon Supreme God discovering its identity.</p><p>The battle continued for more than a year this way and the members of  the Divine Palace kept falling to their enemies in this battle. This  turned the Sacred Demon Supreme God into the laughingstock in the eyes  of the other four Supreme Gods, so he was forced to make a trip to the  Jade Pool Divine Domain personally to find out what was going on.</p><p>The Sacred Demon Supreme God was frightened out of his wits when he  saw the Golden Peng and the master and servant contract on its body,  thinking that another variable like the Free and Unfettered Supreme God  had emerged in the God Realm, so he began to scheme behind the scenes.</p><p>The cautious Sacred Demon Supreme God didn’t dare to show his face  because of the fear, hid in a secret location, and kept sending large  forces to deplete the Golden Peng’s divine force, coming close to  killing the Golden Peng a few times. After probing for another  half-a-year, the Sacred Demon Supreme God confirmed that the Golden Peng  had returned to the God Realm alone and also confirmed that the master  and servant contract on its body hadn’t provided any assistance to it at  all.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
