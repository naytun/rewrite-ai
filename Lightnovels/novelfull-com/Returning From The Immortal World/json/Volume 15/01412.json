Tang Xiu had come dressed for battle, wearing black armor and wielding his divine sword in hand as he surveyed the surroundings coolly.</p><p>After the army of the Great Tang Empire had entered his Heavenly Abode nine days ago, he had made haste to reach the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect. Although he could faintly sense someone spying on him during this time, he couldn’t find their tracks even after using the Heavenly Magic Mirror.</p><p>As such, he had left the ranks of his entourage along with Old Sycamore and Eagle in an attempt to draw out the enemy. If the enemy were to appear, Tang Xiu planned to engage in battle with them after summoning the four Supremes that were stationed within a small-sized Heavenly Abode he carried on him.</p><p>“Your Majesty, could it be that you were mistaken?” Eagle asked in a slightly hesitating tone as he checked the surroundings unceasingly with his keen gaze.</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head and said, “That’s very unlikely. I’ve had this feeling countless times before, and it has helped me survive through danger equally if not more times. I’m certain that someone is hiding within the darkness and spying on us. If they are a hostile party, they would be making an appearance soon enough.”</p><p>Time flitted by and two whole days passed by in a flash. Although Tang Xiu and the others were seated cross-legged on this planet, they were on high alert at all times over these last two days.</p><p>Eagle’s heart trembled in palpation as he spoke, “They’ve come.”</p><p>Tang Xiu flew up and looked towards the distant void. He could already see the clear image of a war chariot making its way towards them, and soon after, there was only a distance of 10,000 meters left between them. The chariot just had one mysterious black-robed man riding on it, and he had donned an immortal robe that prevented the spiritual sense of others to sense him along with a black mask on his face.</p><p>“Who are you?” Tang Xiu asked as he stood mid-air and directed his gaze towards the mysterious man.</p><p>On the chariot, Shade Demon Zhu Wushou’s lips curled into a smile, and a dark look appeared on his face as he enunciated his words, “Many have asked me this question before, but all of them have perished in soul and flesh after asking it. If I remember it correctly, a vast majority of them belonged to the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect.”</p><p>A cold glint flashed across Tang Xiu’s eyes as he replied in a deep voice, “Someone once told me that he injured my disciple and almost caused my Yan’er to perish perpetually. I believe you’re him, right?”</p><p>“Asura Witch… Gu Yan’er?”</p><p>Shade Demon Zhu Wushou took his mask off along with the hat he was wearing to reveal his beguiling, handsome looks as well as scattered white hair.</p><p>Tang Xiu said with a sneer, “Shade Demon Zhu Wushou. I never thought you would drop in before I even went looking for you. Even I hadn’t sensed the deep hatred you held for my Vermillion Bird Holy Sect at all. I really commend you for that!”</p><p>Shade Demon Zhu Wushou laughed out loud. “I really never expected this. Who could have known that the Great Tang Heavenly Emperor of the Great Tang Empire is actually the former Star Cultivation Great Emperor? Hahahaha… This is indeed interesting, very interesting. That foolish disciple of mine actually betrayed me for you, hehehe… She had a pretty straightforward death, yet you have managed to survive, this is indeed pretty vexing. Also, Great Emperor Daqing and Zither Demon Jiuyao, these two good-for-nothings. They plotted so long back then yet still failed in the end.”</p><p>Tang Xiu clenched his fists hard and gazed at Shade Demon Zhu Wushou with rancor. If someone were to ask him who he hated the most in this world, it was neither Great Emperor Daqing nor Zither Demon Jiuyao, but rather this Shade Demon Zhu Wushou before him.</p><p>It was him who had made him feel the sense of betrayal by his true love!</p><p>It was him who had persecuted him by manipulating events while hiding in the shadows!</p><p>A somewhat sinister expression appeared on Tang Xiu’s face as he replied to him gloomily, “Your darling disciple didn’t betray you. If she hadn’t snuck an attack on me first, it would have been hard for Great Emperor Daqing and Zither Demon Jiuyao to kill me with their paltry abilities. I’ve always guarded my back against others except for those closest to me, and she was the only outsider other than my father and family among those exceptions.”</p><p>Shade Demon Zhu Wushou laughed out loud. “So it was like that. It seems like you hate her very much, huh? It’s a pity that she’s already dead, or else it would have been pretty interesting to see you two meet each other again. Aren’t I right? The most dazzling Supreme of the Immortal World, Star Cultivation Great Emperor?”</p><p>Tang Xiu sneered. “You better stop counting your chickens before they are hatched since it’s just going to be futile.”</p><p>Shade Demon Zhu Wushou said with a laugh, “It doesn’t matter even if it ends up futile. After all, she’s just a chess piece of mine, so as far as I’m concerned, I have suffered no losses even if she has perished eternally. I’m actually more curious about you. You have actually re-cultivated so quickly and also managed to establish a behemoth like the Great Tang Empire. This is really impressive!”</p><p>Tang Xiu took a deep breath and said, “Since you know my Great Tang Empire is a behemoth with plenty of powerhouses afoot, I don’t know whether to praise you for your courage or to curse your stupidity for showing up.”</p><p>Shade Demon Zhu Wushou raised his hand and laughed. “I have one last question. If you are able to answer this, I’ll give you one chance to battle me directly.”</p><p>“Ask away!” Tang Xiu stated indifferently.</p><p>Shade Demon Zhu Wushou chuckled. “You must be the reason Heavenly Emperor Tianji amputated his arm, right? Just what ace did you use to make him do that so resolutely?”</p><p>Tang Xiu said faintly, “I just made someone tell this to him—Amputate your arm if you wish to live, and that will resolve the grudge.”</p><p>Shade Demon Zhu Wushou’s expression changed slightly. The smile of his face vanished as he gave Tang Xiu a profound look before responding coldly, “That’s quite impressive, Great Tang Heavenly Emperor. This Heavenly Emperor Tianji, on the other hand, is pretty trashy. A stately Supreme like him actually got scared by a few words from you and amputated his arm, what a fool he is. Never mind, I’ll eliminate you here today and then find a way to crush that Great Tang Empire of yours.”</p><p>Saying so, he waved his arms, and in just a few breaths, a total of six Supremes as well as a few dozen Perfected Golden Immortals, surrounded Tang Xiu, Eagle, and Old Sycamore.</p><p>“How is this possible?” Tang Xiu’s expression changed suddenly. He felt enraged when he saw the six Supremes who had appeared and roared at them. “Supreme Mantis, Supreme Mega, Supreme Icesnow. I never thought you three would actually become the lackeys of Shade Demon Zhu Wushou.”</p><p>Supreme Icesnow sneered back at him. “Star Cultivation Great Emperor… oh, pardon me. You’re Great Tang Heavenly Emperor now, right? Since we can obtain what we want the most from Shade Demon Zhu Wushou’s hands, we’ll obviously have no qualms working for him. Do you know? We can get a Divinity Attainment Pill as long as we succeed in killing you. Hahaha… I have 60% confidence in crossing the divine tribulation and ascending to the God Realm to become a Deity with the Divinity Attainment Pill’s aid.”</p><p>“Killing me is just a pipe dream for you all,” Tang Xiu called the four Supremes stationed within his Heavenly Abode outside and said majestically, “Although you are a bit stronger than us, our side doesn’t lack in killing methods at all. Shade Demon Zhu Wushou, since you chose this place as the battlefield, you must have planned to battle us here at once, right? It’s just that…”</p><p>Supreme Icesnow’s expression changed greatly as he asked in a deep voice, “What?”</p><p>Tang Xiu smirked and said, “It’s just that you are on a time limit. If you fail to eliminate us all within seven days, your judgment day might just end up falling upon you. My Great Tang Empire has close to 20 Supremes now, so I really wish to see who will come out alive in this final game between us.”</p><p>“Just empty talk.” Supreme Icesnow snorted as he didn’t believe Tang Xiu’s words. After all, he had never heard of any force possessing more than 10 Supremes, let alone 20.</p><p>Shade Demon Zhu Wushou stated gloomily, “Stop wasting your breath and attack now! We still need to make a trip to the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect after this. It took a lot of effort to obtain the Formation Breaking Talisman from the Demon Realm, so it’s time to destroy the Vermillion Bird Holy Sect after a millennium-long struggle at death’s door.”</p><p>“Kill them!”</p><p>The six Supremes who had arrived with Shade Demon Zhu Wushou, as well as dozens of Perfected Golden Immortals, unfounded a fearsome attack on Tang Xiu’s group.</p><p>“Rainbow Phantasmagoria Realm.” Tang Xiu employed one of his divine powers at the instant they moved and targeted Shade Demon Zhu Wushou and the other six Supreme powerhouses.</p><p>Spurt! Spurt! Spurt!</p><p>The subordinates of Shade Demon Zhu Wushou and the six Supremes were caught off guard and fell under the illusion of the Rainbow Phantasmagoria Realm. Although they broke free from the illusion almost instantaneously and even managed to dodge Tang Xiu and the others’ fatal attacks, they had gained some flesh injuries on their bodies.</p><p>“Die, Star Cultivation Great Emperor!”</p><p>Shade Demon Zhu Wushou was a late-stage Supreme powerhouse and could contend with two to three Supremes at the early-stage or mid-stage with his battle strength. As such, while the other Supremes confronted Eagle, Old Sycamore, and the others together with the Perfected Golden Immortals, Tang Xiu faced Shade Demon Zhu Wushou’s attacks and got blown away in just a few dozen breaths.</p><p>“What a strong physique. I never expected the new Star Cultivation Great Emperor to actually become a body cultivator.”</p><p>Although Tang Xiu hadn’t suffered that many injuries when he got blown away, he could feel the disparity in strength between him and Shade Demon Zhu Wushou.</p><p>“We’re outmatched and outnumbered, so we’re unable to take the upper hand.” Tang Xiu took a deep breath and used his strongest divine power immediately.</p><p>“Heavenly Net.”</p><p>The powerful Primal Chaos Force flowed out from Tang Xiu’s body steadily along with the appearance of illusionary lines within the void. The six Supremes confronting Eagle, Old Sycamore, and the others were affected instantaneously, and two of them suffered from heavy injuries because of the split-second gap that had opened up, while the other four were also inflicted with light injuries.</p><p>“What’s this damned thing? Break for me.” A wrathful expression appeared on Shade Demon Zhu Wushou’s beguiling face as he struck Tang Xiu with his saber. The countless multicolored lines that had appeared suddenly had stopped the beam of saber light his saber had emitted.</p><p>Boom…</p><p>The saber struck the Primal Chaos Force that Tang Xiu had released after slicing through all the lines and blew him away, and Shade Demon Zhu Wushou appeared before Tang Xiu in the next instant. A beam of light flashed by as he struck at Tang Xiu’s head fiercely, seemingly with an intent to behead Tang Xiu with this single attack.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
