She admitted that anger and hatred were indeed clouding her judgment since she was impatient to get revenge for her relatives.</p><p>Realizing that his words were rather effective, Tom Reggie spoke again quickly, “Ms. Vivi, please think about it. Revenge is a must, but it’s imperative to calm yourself down before you do so. The people who dared to kill your relatives presumably are those with unusual backgrounds. And those who have great influence are all ruthless and will resort to all means. If your judgment is clouded, not only will the progress of your investigation be affected, unexpected mishaps would also occur, resulting in the failure of your revenge. Even you yourself will also be in danger.”</p><p>Viviani calmed down. Though anger and hatred were still fully packed inside her, what Tom Reggie had said was reasonable. Calming down she would be able to remember those whom she had offended in the past that presumably killed her relatives.</p><p>“Go! I need to be alone!” Viviani waved and sat down on the sofa.</p><p>Secretly relieved inside, Tom Reggie then said, “Ms. Vivi, you are my benefactor. If you want to, I’ll send some people to help investigate and gather news on your enemies. I’ll also bring some manpower to help you in your revenge when the time comes. Your enemy is my enemy.”</p><p>Looking up, Viviani looked at the serious-looking Tom Reggie as she finally nodded and said, “Thanks, Tom.”</p><p>Shaking his head, Tom Reggie replied, “Ms. Vivi, you’re forever the most dazzling and honorable person inside my heart. So you don’t need to be this polite to me. Well, please rest first. I must go to Mr. Tang now. If he had not told me about this, I’m afraid I would be in the dark about this matter.”</p><p>“Go!” Viviani waved.</p><p>After Tom Reggie left, Viviani nested herself on the sofa as tears broke out, flowing and rolling down her skin, wetting her lapels. She kept recalling all the forces and people she had offended all these years before her family members died one after another.</p><p>Gradually, with her outstanding memory, she finally had dozens of suspects in her mind and secretly made a decision that, regardless of who killed her family members, she must completely decimate them.</p><p>‘Mr. Tang?’</p><p>After wiping the tears from her face, Viviani stood from the sofa and walked to door. She had to see Tang Xiu. She found that the man was a genuine matured person and someone who could see through the nature of things.</p><p>If, if it wasn’t for him telling Tom Reggie about this, she would have been blinded by her anger and hatred now, becoming a headless fly wandering around.</p><p>At the seaside villa.</p><p>Tang Xiu was conversing with the Old Li couple when he saw Tom Reggie coming back. From him he knew that Viviani had calmed down and the tinge of worry he had toward her immediately disappeared. However, he hadn’t thought she would actually come back to the party without being asked.</p><p>“It seems you now understand that being impulsive is a devil in itself!” Tang Xiu smiled and said slowly.</p><p>“Thanks, Mr. Tang. I will offer you fine gift after my revenge as a token of gratitude,” said Viviani with a nod.</p><p>Tang Xiu waved his hand, “No need.”</p><p>Viviani no longer spoke as she walked straight to the stairs. She wasn’t in the mood to stay in the party anymore, but she recalled Tang Xiu saying that there would be a fight between powerful experts in the evening. She now also realized how inexperienced she was in combat.</p><p>Hence, she must learn to become stronger!</p><p>Only when she became stronger could she get revenge for her relatives as well as better being able to protect the people she cared about in the future.</p><p>As the evening banquet ended, Tom Reggie bade farewell and left, while Fatty Li escorted his wife and daughter back and then rushed back, as he also knew that Wang Rui had a scheduled fight with Tang Xiu’s subordinate.</p><p>At the second floor’s balcony.</p><p>Tang Xiu, Viviani, and Fatty Li were sitting before a small round table, sipping tea while calmly waiting. As for Mo Awen and Mo Awu, they were now sitting cross-legged in the back of the house, quietly cultivating.</p><p>“How come that Qingcheng Mountain kiddo isn't here yet?”</p><p>An hour passed in waiting and Fatty Li was a bit impatient.</p><p>“The appointment between us is at 12 AM. It’s 11:30 now, so there are 30 minutes left. Just be patient,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“I just wanna see the fight earlier. I can’t wait for your show,” hummed Fatty Li.</p><p>“Huh, my show?” Tang Xiu was surprised. “What show?”</p><p>“Don’t tell me you forgot? You gotta…” Fatty Li cried out. He abruptly came to a halt. When he found that Viviani was in a daze and wasn’t pay attention them, he shot Tang Xiu a teasing look and then pursed his lips whilst facing Viviani, hinting that it was inappropriate to mention the program show before another woman.</p><p>Tang Xiu slightly furrowed his brows before a thought crossed his mind. He then laughed and said, “Ah, you’re talking about the upcoming program I picked, aren’t you? Umm, what was it, ah, Seven Goddesses Dance, right? Right, it’s this one. Fatty Li, you’ve kept me guessing as to what exactly the Seven Goddesses Dance is until now!”</p><p>“Brother Tang, this program is meant to be interpreted in our minds, it cannot be talked about. Only after you enjoy it will you understand what it is! It’s a pit I’m rather old—my limbs are no longer fast to insist such a long time, or else, I really wanted to join in the fun.\"</p><p>“Could this program require a lot of exercises?” asked Tang Xiu, surprised.</p><p>Fatty Li affirmed, “Very much! Most people are simply unable to endure it.”</p><p>“Ah, it turns out to be so! But I’m not your average man, though. So there should be no problem,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Right at this time, Mo Awen, who sat cross-legged on the floor, suddenly jumped up. When he looked downstairs, he saw that a man with two bodyguards had arrived and immediately called out, “Boss, the guests are here.”</p><p>Looking at the stair’s direction, Tang Xiu saw Wang Rui with a cigarette clamped by his lips. His expression was frivolous as he came toward him.</p><p>“Wow, Brother Tang is truly great! You even charmed this beautiful woman who was gambling with me?” Wang Rui said with a smile that yet unlike one.</p><p>“Don’t talk such nonsense! Viviani is just a friend of mine. But you still didn’t abstice even though you clearly know that you’d fight my man. You’ve just wasted your strength on a women’s belly, didn’t you?”</p><p>“How did you know?” asked Wang Rui in astonishment.</p><p>“Your vitality seems a bit faint; far worse than when we met back then. If you didn’t get sucked by a fabled vampire then you should have wasted your physical strength on women,” said Tang Xiu lightly.</p><p>Whilst raising his thumb up, Wang Rui exclaimed in praise, “Brother Tang is amazing. You can see through my body! I suddenly feel that rather than playing with your subordinate, it’ll be more interesting to play with you! How about fighting me?”</p><p>Tang Xiu said with a smile, “I will naturally accompany you playing if you can beat my man. But before that, you had better rest for two hours in order to not feel that my subordinate’s victory was due to that and not because of his combat strength.”</p><p>Wang Rui waved his hand, “It’s fine. I don’t need to rest.”</p><p>“Then please have a sit and drink a cup of tea! There’s still half an hour to the agreed time. We’ll have the bout outside on the beach. How about it?” said Tang Xiu after a moment of silence.</p><p>“Let’s decide so,” said Wang Rui with a smile.</p><p>After taking a seat, Wang Rui squinted his eyes at Tang Xiu, asking with a smile, “Brother Tang, I only know your name, but I don’t from where you come from! I have seen some information about those big respected families’ scions, such as their photos and names, but I haven’t heard about you at all.”</p><p>Lightly smiling, Tang Xiu said, “I’m just a nobody, not worth mentioning.”</p><p>Wang Rui shook his head, “No. it’s not a simple feat to be able to invite such powerful bodyguards. Say something and I’ll give it a try. I might be able to know something about you depending on the pointer.”</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent for a moment and suddenly grinned, “I’m actually a student who’s about to to enter university. In addition, I’m also half a doctor who worked at Star City Chinese Medical Hospital for a few days before.”</p><p>A student and unofficial doctor?</p><p>From the beginning, Wang Rui didn’t buy Tang Xiu’s words at all. Because he immediately sent some people to investigate Tang Xiu when they parted ways in the casino. But he didn’t get the news from the mainland but rather from Saipan, from which he heard that Tang Xiu had just won 1 billion in the casino. It was a much faster and bigger win compared to his victory in the gambling table.</p><p>However, what surprised him was that Tang Xiu was still safe and sound now even though he won that 1 billion.</p><p>“Brother Tang, you’re not being honest! Perhaps Fatty Li has told you about me? I asked your identity but you still concealed it. It’s kinda boring.” Wang Rui put one leg over the other and casually lit up a cigarette.</p><p>Furrowing his brows, Tang Xiu said in reply, “I didn’t lie. I really am about to enter University as well as am an unofficial doctor. You can investigate it if you don’t believe me. However, I’m someone who hates being investigated by others; I will make them pay a price if I found out about it.”</p><p>Wang Rui was silent for a moment and suddenly laughed, “Since Brother Tang doesn’t want to say it, I’m also someone who doesn’t want to force anyone against their will! Well, I won more money than you this time, hence I’m inviting you to a sumptuous banquet after we return home.”</p><p>Tang Xiu didn’t take such pleasantries seriously and simply replied with a few words. He then looked at Mo Awen and said calmly, “Give your best strength and do not lower your guard, or you’ll fail miserably.”</p><p>Mo Awen glanced at Wang Rui and continued to carefully comprehend the changes of a martial artist’s state of mind. Tang Xiu’s directions had enlightened him, resulting in his great improvement. Hence, he came to a realization that, once he could comprehend some of a cultivator’s state of mind, it would be a turning point for him to advance. He now understood the significance of the state of mind to cultivators. If he could, he wished to have dozens of enlightenments every day.</p><p>Time flew by. Tang Xiu then suddenly stood and slowly said, “It’s about time. Awen, you and Mr. Wang go to the beach! Don’t disappoint Mr. Wang and the others.”</p><p>“I guarantee you it won’t happen!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
