There’s no end in the path of martial arts. Sometimes having a setback is a good thing, and martial artists must guard against arrogance and impetuosity. One must know that there’s always someone better and there’s a heaven beyond the heaven. I’m waiting for you to challenge my subordinate again when you become stronger.”</p><p>Wang Rui took a deep breath and sternly said, “I will challenge your man again, but my ultimate goal is you. I hope I can challenge and defeat you one day.”</p><p>“I’ll be waiting,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>At the sided, with an unusual light in her eyes, Viviani suddenly came in front of Mo Awen and said, “Teach me your Kung Fu! I want to acknowledge you as my Master.”</p><p>Acknowledging a Master?</p><p>Mo Awen was stunned and immediately looked at Tang Xiu.</p><p>“Hey, don’t look at me. Keep me out of it,” Tang Xiu waved and said.</p><p>Thinking for a moment, Mo Awen looked at Viviani and said slowly, “I’m sorry. I have no intention to accept disciples.”</p><p>Viviani quickly said, “As long as you can make me become as powerful as you, I’ll pay any price. How about I pay you with money? I’m rich and have lots of money.”</p><p>Mo Awen shook his head, “I’m not short on money. Even if you give me a mountain of gold, I will still not accept you as a disciple since I don’t have much time.”</p><p>Viviani turned to look at Tang Xiu with pleading eyes.</p><p>Tang Xiu was silent before he shook his head and said, “Since he doesn’t want to accept you as a disciple, I also don’t have any means. He may be my subordinate, but I will never force him to do what he doesn’t wanna do. Also, he isn’t suited to be your teacher. What he excels at is killing skills. For example, the fight between him and Wang Rui just now. Were it a frontal combat, Wang Rui would be killed by him in the exchanges at the most.”</p><p>Shocked, Wang Rui was stupefied. With anger in his eyes, he said, “Wasn’t it kinda overboard, Tang Xiu? Even if I’m weaker than Mo Awen, can he kill me within 10 moves?”</p><p>Mo Awen interrupted, “Ten moves are too many. I can kill you within five moves.”</p><p>Wang Rui’s lips twitched a few times, but no sounds came out of it. However, the look of disbelief on his face fully expressed his feelings.</p><p>Right at this time, Tang Xiu moved and grabbed Wang Rui’s arm lighting fast. Before the latter reacted, he shook Wang Rui’s wrist while his other hand held Wang Rui’s shoulder. With a ‘crack’ sound, Wang Rui’s expression greatly changed; his dislocated arms had been fixed.</p><p>Retracting back his hands, Tang Xiu then said calmly, “You don’t need to doubt it. When Awen fought you, he had many good chances to kill you directly. But since he knew that you’re not an enemy, hence he didn’t do it out of mercy. Also, he didn’t use his full strength when he fought you.”</p><p>Wang Rui waved his arm. As he felt only faint pain from his dislocated arm and no other symptoms, the anger in his eyes slowly faded, replaced by a bitter smile. He then nodded and said, “I know that he didn’t go all out!”</p><p>Tang Xiu turned around and looked toward the unhappy-looking Viviani and immediately said with a smile, “Actually, I have a way to make you stronger, but it’s kinda dangerous.”</p><p>Viviani’s spirit was roused. She was full of hatred, wanting to find the people who killed her relatives and avenge them. Hence, she asked quickly, “What is it?”</p><p>“We’ll talk about this matter later,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Having said that, he looked at Fatty Li and Wang Rui and said with a faint smile, “The two of you, today’s matter has been concluded. Shouldn’t you go back to rest?”</p><p>Cupping his fists, Wang Rui then turned around and left with his two men.</p><p>As for Fatty Li, he didn’t move and cheerfully looked at Tang Xiu as he smiled and asked, “Brother Tang, you have yet to enjoy the Seven Goddesses Dance, no? Since there’s a beauty accompanying you tonight, you shouldn’t go. But won’t you still let it pass tomorrow? If you can complete the whole course of the Seven Goddesses Dance, I’ll treat you to a feast.”</p><p>“I need to look at the situation first! I plan to leave tomorrow, but if the storm at the sea isn’t over yet by then, I’ll stay for another day, and then experience this Seven Goddesses Dance!” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“You wanna leave? Where to? Are you going back home?” asked Fatty Li, surprised.</p><p>“No, I’m going on an expedition,” Tang Xiu shook his head.</p><p>With a strange expression, Fatty Li looked at Tang Xiu. He shook his head and said with a smile, “Youngsters nowadays have good ideas. But if you go adventuring, don’t tell that Qingcheng Mountain kiddo. Or else he will surely follow you like a plaster; you won’t be able to shake him off.”</p><p>“Got it!” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>He didn’t have the intention to tell others about the private island he had purchased except to those close to him. After all, he was going to build a site that really belonged to him there as a base to train his army. Hence, it absolutely couldn’t be exposed.</p><p>Along with Fatty Li’s departure, Tang Xiu hinted Mo Awen and Mo Awu to go back and rest. He then took Viviani to the living room. “If you want to become stronger, you can train in some training camps and have your revenge afterward. I heard Mo Awen speak about them. There are many training camps in the world specialized in training experts. If you want to go there, you can quickly rise above others.”</p><p>A training camp?</p><p>Viviani remembered that Tom Reggie had such experience once and silently nodded. Prior to this, she was always merciful and softhearted. Even to those who did evil, she wouldn’t kill them and only gave them some fierce lessons, and then extorted a large sum of money from them to solve it.</p><p>Only now did she realize that her soft heartedness killed a lot of her family members.</p><p>“Thanks, Tang Xiu,” Viviani spoke and then turned to leave.</p><p>Looking at her back, Tang Xiu secretly sighed in his heart. He couldn’t tell whether what he did would be good or bad for her. But he thought that her special force would be wasted if she didn’t get stronger.</p><p>“Um, the Seven Goddesses Dance?”</p><p>Recalling the program he picked before, Tang Xiu shook his head secretly. Fatty Li was deliberately making it look mysterious, causing a strong curiosity to sprout inside his heart. In any case, he also couldn’t sleep now, so he decided to experience this program, finding out what its magicalness was exactly.</p><p>“Please arrange the Seven Goddesses Dance for me.”</p><p>After using the landline phone in the building to call Jasmine, Tang Xiu straightforwardly spoke.</p><p>“Alright. Someone will take you there shortly.”</p><p>A few minutes later, a seductively dressed girl in a nightgown arrived at Tang Xi’s residence and said in fluent English, “Are you, Mr. Tang? Vice President Jasmine ordered me to guide you to the pleasure center.”</p><p>“Yes, it’s me!” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>Whilst following behind the girl, Tang Xiu asked curiously, “Beautiful Miss, can you tell me in advance what sort of program the Seven Goddesses Dance is? It’s just that my friend always looked mysterious and secretive speaking about it.”</p><p>“Pfft...”</p><p>The lass couldn’t help but burst into laughter before she asked with a smile, “You don’t know what sort of program the Seven Goddesses Dance is, Sir?”</p><p>“I really don’t know!” Tang Xiu shook his head.</p><p>The lass said with a smile, “Since you don’t know, you might as well come with me! Wait until you have clearly experienced it. You will definitely enjoy it greatly as long as you stay alive and well.”</p><p>Alive and well? What does it mean?</p><p>A puzzled expression hung on Tang Xiu’s face. Looking at the lass who no longer wanted to explain, he could only stuff it inside his heart as he proceeded forward alongside her.</p><p>Seven or eight minutes later, they came to a European-style building.</p><p>Taking a broad look around, Tang Xiu found that this building was rather peculiar. Firstly, not to mention its outward wall being painted red, each window had its curtain pulled open, which revealed its interior painted with the scarlet, orange, vermillion, green, dark green, indigo and purple colors.</p><p>“Welcome, honored Sir!”</p><p>Four beautiful girls in seductively long skirts stood in front of the building, greeting Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and followed the girl into the building. He then realized that the interior design and decoration was full of a dubious atmosphere as there was a shiny steel tube erected in the middle of the hall surrounded by walls with flashing gold lightings illuminating it. The compelling design itself not only had a slightly bizarre model of a beautiful woman, there were even many which were supposed to be handsome or cool and strong men.</p><p>“Mr. Tang, we have seven-storied pleasure centers altogether here. Might I ask what floor you wish to go?” The girl brought Tang Xiu to the elevator door and inquired with a smile.</p><p>“What’s the difference?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“The higher the floor, the more beautiful the girl there is and the more expensive the price. However, Vice President has explained that you are completely exempted from expenses, hence you can choose any floor you wish,” said the girl.</p><p>“To the seventh floor, then!” said Tang Xiu without thinking.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>As the elevator door opened, the girl took Tang Xiu along. When they arrived at the seventh floor, Tang Xiu then saw a woman in exposed dressing. She had an extremely hot and provocative figure as she stood outside, a dazzling smile on her face.</p><p>The girl who guided him introduced, “Mr. Tang, she’s Reval, the one in charge of the seventh floor. Since I’ve escorted you here, I’ve accomplished my task. I wish you a pleasant stay here.”</p><p>Having said that, she slightly bowed toward Tang Xiu, returned to the elevator and directly left.</p><p>“Please lead the way!”</p><p>Faintly, Tang Xiu could guess something, but wasn’t sure of it yet. Hence, he said directly to Reval.</p><p>“Please…”</p><p>Reval guided Tang Xiu walking under the purple lights. They passed across two corridors and then arrived at a well-decorated, yet still ambiguous-styled room. She then smiled and said, “Mr. Tang, please rest for a bit. There are fruits and desserts on the table as well as a variety of drinks inside the refrigerator. If you want to take a shower first, you can go to the bathroom in the side room. Please pardon us, we’ve to prepare for about 20 minutes. The program will formally start afterward.”</p><p>“Is this program rather troublesome?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>“No, it’s not. As long as your ability is good, it definitely is the best enjoyment in the world. If you have no other instructions, please pardon my leave first,” said Reval with a smile.</p><p>Tang Xiu waved as his vision then observed this 200-300 square meters room.</p><p>It was luxurious and extravagant!</p><p>In front of a long leather sofa was a long table filled with all kinds of desserts and fruits; even many exquisite side dishes were on it. There was even a locker next to the sofa with a stack of fashion magazines. On the wall was hung a sixty inches LCD TV. The TV was muted, but it was displaying photos of beautiful women.</p><p>“I’ll take a shower!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
