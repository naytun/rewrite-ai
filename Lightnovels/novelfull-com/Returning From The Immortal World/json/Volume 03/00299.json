Even though he went all out and sped up to his limit, Mo Awen could still follow beside him, neither too fast nor too slow and didn’t fall behind in the slightest, even seemingly holding back.</p><p>“Give me your best shot. Don’t let me down,” Mo Awen replied with a light laugh.</p><p>Don’t let you down?</p><p>Coldness glowed inside Wang Rui’s eyes. He once said to Tang Xiu that he was someone who loved challenges. But to think that his bodyguard would actually challenge him?</p><p>He was quite resentful, and the consequences for that would be dire.</p><p>“I will defeat you with everything I got, making you admit your defeat thoroughly. Then I’ll weigh your boss as how much pounds he got in store.”</p><p>Mo Awen crackled his fingers as he smiled, “You have no way to find out my Boss’s weight. Come, give me all you got. I’ll use strength to convince you.”</p><p>“Hmph…”</p><p>Forming a palm, Wang Rui moved and appeared in front Mo Awen, his hand slashing toward Mo Awen’s neck as though a blade. The speed of his palm blade was fast. So fast it brought about a whooshing sound and the air surge.</p><p>Using his tiptoe to tap the ground, Mo Awen instantly moved backward to avoid Wang Rui’s palm chop. He jumped up and flipped his legs, sending Wang Rui a fierce kick. The continuous images of the trajectory of his kicks were unending, causing one to be unable to discern whether they were real or illusory.</p><p>“Bam, bam, bam!”</p><p>Failing, Wang Rui quickly whipped out his leg. In a flash, dozens of kicks had been exchanged between them. Legs were countered by legs and calves collided with calves, bringing about an immense vibrating wave force, causing their complexion to slightly change at the same time. Yet, Wang Rui felt like he was kicking an iron stake. The impact force brought about incomparable pain to his right leg, causing him to be in constant retreat. In stark contrast, Mo Awen only had a slight change in expression, but his formidable aura did not weaken in the slightest. He was like a maggot feeding on a corpse that clung onto him as his legs were as though long whips, thrashing again in sequence.</p><p>On the villa balcony, Tang Xiu stood as though a spear with his hands folded, overlooking the two fighting men on the beach. Beside him were Viviani and Old Fatty Li watching intently the fighting figures on the beach, looking somewhat shocked.</p><p>For Viviani, who possessed formidable strength and speed, yet didn’t know how to utilize them, Mo Awen and Wang Rui, who were much inferior to her in terms of speed and strength, yet were performing sophisticated combat skills despite the seemingly simple moves... It left her dazed and shocked inside.</p><p>A strong desire to learn from them surged up inside her heart, wanting to enrich her combat experience.</p><p>Shocks also struck Old Fatty Li. He was also someone who was skilled in martial arts. Though he was fat and his abilities couldn’t be compared to his past years, he was still agile. Fighting against three to five thugs by himself, he would still come out as the victor. However, the fight between Mo Awen and Wang Rui was an eye-opener for him.</p><p>It was much more striking than watching Chinese Kung fu movies.</p><p>In his eyes, the fight on the beach was a combat between two experts in the martial arts society. Those formidable styles and exquisite moves dazzled him. Hence, he came to the realization that were he to fight any one of them, he would perhaps be knocked out in a flash.</p><p>“Chinese Kung fu is really broad and profound.”</p><p>Shock and excitement struck Fatty Old Li as he sighed wholeheartedly.</p><p>Glancing at him, Tang Xiu laughed, “Fatty Li, your strength is commendable! Though you have a fat body, an average person won’t be able to fight you, no? What is it? You haven’t seen a fight between experts at this level before?”</p><p>“It’s my first time seeing it,” Fatty Li shook his head and forced out a smile.</p><p>“It’s understandable, though. There are so many people practicing martial arts in the world, but true experts are very rare. Being able to see two experts at the same time as well as watching them fight is indeed a scene very difficult to happen. Anyways, who do you think will win?”</p><p>Without hesitation, Fatty Li replied, “Mo Awen.”</p><p>Raising his eyebrows and smiling, Tang Xiu asked, “Why are you so sure?”</p><p>Fatty Li pointed at the two men and said, “Though Wang Rui’s kung fu is powerful, it’s evident that he’s somewhat straining. But take a look at Mo Awen, his attacks are steady, neither too fast nor slow, yet each move makes Wang Rui constantly retreat. He occasionally blocks and evades, immediately counterattacking afterward.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded, praising, “It seems your eyes are good, Fatty Li. Though Wang Rui is also an expert and is experienced in combat, there’s still a big gap between them. If there’s no accident, Wang Rui will be defeated within ten moves.”</p><p>Suddenly, Viviani asked, “Mr. Tang, if I had Wang Rui’s combat experience and skills, do you think I could defeat your bodyguard?”</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Tang Xiu humorlessly replied, “Were you to have rich fighting experience, let alone Mo Awen, perhaps even I myself would not be your opponent.”</p><p>Fatty Li himself was clueless about Viviani’s strength. He thought that Tang Xiu was flirting with her. With a teasing look, he said, “Brother Tang, you won’t hit her since it’s evident that you clearly have a soft heart toward her and don’t want to hurt a belle, no? Only, do you really know kung fu?”</p><p>Tang Xiu laughed, “I know a little about kung fu. I can’t say that I’m good at it, though. But I can say that it’s enough for self-defense.”</p><p>Despite knowing Tang Xiu for a short period of time, Fatty Li could tell that Tang Xiu was an extremely low-key young man. He felt that the Tang Xiu’s words were overly humble. His kung fu skill might be under his bodyguards but perhaps was still a lot stronger than him.</p><p>On the beach.</p><p>Wang Rui moved fast as though lightning. Most of his techniques were killing moves. Unfortunately, even if he raised his strength a level higher, he still couldn’t do a thing to Mo Awen. He even faintly felt that he was in constant retreat while Mo Awen himself was seemingly holding back.</p><p>Yes. He had done his best, but Mo Awen had not!</p><p>This feeling somewhat shocked to him, but it vexed him more.</p><p>During the exchange of fists and kicks, Wang Rui finally ceased his footsteps forcibly. He staked everything on heavy strikes, frantically sending a bombardment of dozens of fists. Blurred shadow paths, along with sonic booms, caused one’s heart to shiver.</p><p>“Originally, I thought you were much stronger since Boss wanted me to compare notes with you. It turns out that even using 70% of my strength is useless since you actually had been forced to such a desperate strait. If so, I might as well end it earlier!” As Wang Rui sent out dozens of fists toward Mo Awen and staggered backward, Mo Awen suddenly appeared behind him as his fists moved in a strange trajectory, seemingly about to bombard Wang Rui’s back. But due to Wang Rui’s sudden and hasty avoidance, it ended up hitting his shoulder instead. Along with the sound of dislocated bones, Wang Rui’s body was as though a fallen leaf as it advanced and smashed toward the beach seven to eight meters away.</p><p>“Bam…”</p><p>With a muffled sound, Wang Rui smashed on the beach with a pale face before jumping up as though a carp. A shocked look flickered in his eyes as he stood there seven or eight meters away looking at Mo Awen, a strong bitterness surging in his heart.</p><p>He lost! He knew he had been defeated, thoroughly.</p><p>Mo Awen was too strong, the toughest one he had ever seen in his life. He had fought numerous martial arts grandmasters across the country and won against all with absolute strength. He also had met many experts from foreign countries, whether the one who once won the King of Fighter title, Muay Thai experts, Taekwondo or Judo masters... nobody could beat him.</p><p>Eventually… he lost to someone’s bodyguard.</p><p>“I don’t get it. With your strength, it would be easy for you to dominate the film industry, yet why would you choose to work as someone else’s bodyguard?” said Wang Rui slowly.</p><p>“Do you think being a bodyguard isn’t a good job?” asked Mo Awen with a smile.</p><p>“If you really want to be a bodyguard, how much does Tang Xiu pay you? I can offer you ten times his offer,” Wang Rui frowned and said deeply.</p><p>Mo Awen shook his head, “You can’t give me what I want. Besides, I’m not Boss’s bodyguard, but his subordinate. Whoever dares to harm my Boss, even if I have to trade my life with his, I won’t bat an eye. Besides, you can’t even beat me, so you definitely aren’t his opponent.”</p><p>“What?” Wang Rui’s expression changed and he breathed faster. He stared at Mo Awen tightly and quickly asked, “You mean Tang Xiu is even more powerful than you?”</p><p>“Is Boss more powerful than me? Even if there are ten of you, I’m afraid you are still not Boss’s opponent,” said Mo Awen lightly.</p><p>Having said that, he turned around and walked toward the villa.</p><p>Wang Rui’s expression constantly changed. He recalled what he said to Tang Xiu in the casino as well as when he arrived at the villa, acting arrogantly in front of him. Shame and embarrassment quickly climbed up to his face. He felt like he was trying to teach a fish how to swim, displaying his poor skills before an expert, unaware of how much he was disgracing himself.</p><p>‘For these many years, how long has it been for me to lose this much face?’</p><p>Whilst shaking his head, Wang Rui smiled bitterly before he followed behind Mo Awen toward the villa. His right arm was dislocated and he had no way to fight anymore. Hence, he needed to quickly find someone to fix it.</p><p>On the villa balcony.</p><p>Looking at the two, Tang Xiu, Viviani, and Fatty Li already knew the result of the fight, yet they didn’t show Wang Rui any ridiculing look.</p><p>If he wanted to blame someone, blame Mo Awen for being too strong!</p><p>Yet, Tang Xiu was the one who was the most depressed among them, because he thought that Wang Rui and Mo Awen were fairly equal in terms of strength. Hence, he let them fight so that Mo Awen would reap benefits from it. However, Mo Awen progressed by leaps and bounds due to his sudden epiphany, causing Wang Rui to simply not be his opponent anymore.</p><p>Thus, apart from striking Wang Rui’s acute and sharp disposition, there was no other effect whatsoever.</p><p>“Boss!” Mo Awen was respectful as always.</p><p>“You did well. It’s a pity my purpose hasn’t been achieved, though. However, since your strength has improved, it is still a good thing,” said Tang Xiu with a laugh.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
