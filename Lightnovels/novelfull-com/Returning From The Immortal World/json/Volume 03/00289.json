The architecture was exotic, with each villa constructed on a wide area along with numerous precious vegetation as well as colorful blooming flowers everywhere.</p><p>There were even many well-dressed handsome men and beautiful women, possessing the bearing of nobles. In just ten minutes, Tang Xiu saw dozens of luxury cars rarely seen in China such as the Bugatti Veyron—the world’s limited edition that was priced at tens of millions of yuan.</p><p>“If my guess is correct, Mr. Tang should be from China, right?” Jasmine was rather friendly toward Tang Xiu. As she guided Tang Xiu through the hallway, she explained the landscape of the resort and kept a smile on her face all the while.</p><p>“That’s right,” said Tang Xiu with a nod.</p><p>“China’s economy has been growing rapidly nowadays, and the people in your country are becoming wealthier. At least one-fifth of the tourists staying in Lao Bay Resort come from your country,” said Ai Jasmine with a smile.</p><p>“That many?” asked Tang Xiu in astonishment.</p><p>“Perhaps Lao Bay Resort’s reputation has spread to your country. Hence, many of the guests from your country like to stay here. Though the prices here are rather high, they don’t seem to care about it. The casino is one of the most visited sites for the guests from your country,” said Ai Jasmine with a laugh.</p><p>A casino?</p><p>A strange expression appeared on Tang Xiu’s face upon hearing it. He recalled his endeavor in helping Long Zhengyu and Jia Ruidao’s gambling bet. From two games of gambling, he got a lot of benefits from them.</p><p>Since he had come, should he play a few games?</p><p>The thought crossed his mind as Tang Xiu quickly made up his mind that, after he got some free time after finishing the project, he would visit a casino to play some games. He wanted to experience the gambling scene in a foreign country as well as make some money while convenient.</p><p>The current him had money; he was much richer than in the past!</p><p>The bank card Ji Chimei gave him still had 8 billion in it. He originally planned to give it back to Gu Xiaoxue, but after the incident in Hong Kong with Jiang Tianba, Chen Jianye, Du Changze and Qi Chengshan, he obtained a huge fortune eclipsing the 8 billion yuan in his hands.</p><p>Hence, he decided to use it for the rebuilding project in Nine Dragon Island. However, the island was very large and, according to the rebuilding plan he had in mind, let alone 8 billion, even 80 billion yuan wouldn’t be enough. Thus, he would be more relaxed in the future if he could win some money from the casino.</p><p>At the health club.</p><p>Four beautiful young ladies appeared as Ai Jasmine took Tang Xiu inside. Wearing nightgowns and soft sandals, they bowed toward Tang Xiu. One of the girls then said in fluent English, “We welcome you, Sir. Might I ask what service you picked?”</p><p>Ai Jasmine was the one to reply, “This is Mr. Tang, he needs a Thai Massage. Arrange it for him, I’ll be waiting in the rest area. Remember to inform me after you finished the service.”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>As the vice president of the resort, the four girls naturally knew Ai Jasmine; they being particularly respectful toward her was a given.</p><p>“Please come with me, Mr. Tang.”</p><p>A beautiful girl made an invitation gesture and took Tang Xiu toward a exquisitely decorated corridor inside. After having passed two corridors and through the beautiful environment around the hall, she guided Tang Xiu to another room at the side and then asked, “Mr. Tang, do you need a private room or a public one? The private room has one bed and, aside from the massaging staff, two girls are ready for service, whereas the public room has three beds with three massaging staff and three attendants.”</p><p>Pondering for a moment, Tang Xiu slowly said, “Take me to the public room, the private one is too extravagant.”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The beautiful girl then took Tang Xiu to another hall and opened one of the rooms. Inside there was already a guest enjoying a Thai Massage at the moment. The guest was a chubby middle-aged man full of fat with big ears and short hair whose thick neck had a thick gold necklace that was glittering under the crystal chandeliers’ light.</p><p>The chubby middle-aged man apparently sensed Tang Xiu’s arrival since he turned his head and threw a glance to size up Tang Xiu while enjoying the Thai Massage from a beautiful masseuse. Then, he groaned, “A Japanese?”</p><p>“Chinese,” Tang Xiu’s brow pricked and replied in Mandarin.</p><p>The fatty middle-aged man was stunned for a second as a hint of a smile appeared on his face. He raised his lying hand to Tang Xiu and smiled, “I thought you were a Japanese, but I didn’t expect you to be a fellow countryman! Hey Little Bro, come and take the bed next to me.”</p><p>Putting on a light smile, Tang Xiu looked at the beautiful girl and said, “It’s my first time enjoying a Thai Massage. Is there anything I need to do before the service?”</p><p>The pretty girl said, “You need to go to the dressing room to change your clothes. If you want to take a bath, there’s a bathroom next to it, Mr. Tang. Someone will guide you here and give you a Thai Massage. If there’s anything you need, you can also call the attendants, they will do their best to meet your needs.”</p><p>“I understand!”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded, motioning the beautiful girl to leave. He then turned toward the dressing room, changed his clothes and put on pajamas, and then went to the bathroom for a shower. After he put on the pajamas back, he then came to the public room.</p><p>“Sir, I’m your masseuse and she is your hostess. You can tell us if there’s anything you need. Might I ask whether you want to start now?” Another girl with beautiful looks comparable to the previous girl Tang Xiu had met before came in front of him, followed by another girl in yellow uniform.</p><p>Nodding to her, Tang Xiu then looked at the middle-aged man who was only wearing underwear. He also took off his bathrobe and lied on the next single bed.</p><p>The fat middle-aged man squinted his eyes, watching Tang Xiu’s actions. He asked all smiling, “Little Bro, it’s your first time having a Thai Massage, isn’t it? Are you anxious? Relax buddy. Just enjoy it, we are the Gods here. Even if you say you’re their biological father, they won’t deny it.”</p><p>Rolling his eyes inside, Tang Xiu felt quite amused toward the fat middle-aged man who spoke with a Northeasterner accent.</p><p>The masseuse took off her bathrobe on the bedside of the single men, leaving only three pieces of underwear on her body. She then began to prepare her props such as the massaging oil, clean towels and other things.</p><p>Shortly after, the masseuse’s white hands gently stroked Tang Xiu’s body, causing him to feel somewhat nervous. At this time, he was somewhat secretly regretting. Had he known about it earlier, he would have ordered a private room.</p><p>A Thai Massage indeed could make someone relax and feel comfortable.</p><p>Tang Xiu could clearly feel that this female masseuse was truly skillful. She had a very deep comprehension pertaining the human body. He could even faintly tell that she had a deep knowledge of acupuncture points and meridians of the human body. Though her Thai Massage was somewhat unusual, yet it could make people feel relaxed and comfortable.</p><p>The chubby middle-aged man apparently was slightly excited about having bumped into his fellow countryman here. While resting his head on his arms, he looked at Tang Xiu and asked, “Little Bro, you haven’t told me your name yet, and from which region you come from! My name is Li Laoshan, my buddies used to call me Old Li—the Fatty. I come from the Northeast of China, Fucheng.”</p><p>“I’m Tang Xiu, from Star City of Shuangqing province.”</p><p>Somehow, Tang Xiu was reluctant to speak. But, since the man was, after all, his fellow countryman, he also didn’t want to appear exceedingly indifferent.</p><p>Fatty Old Li apparently knew Star City since he praised with a sigh, “Ah, Star City is a good place! I had been there a few times. To Long’s Dining Hall, in particular. I had once stayed in its presidential suite for a night, but it gave me such a firm impression right away.”</p><p>“I really never thought that you actually had once stayed in the Long’s Dining Hall. It seems you have a friend in Star City, right?” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Fatty Old Li chuckled, “But of course! Though I run a steel business, I have a lot of friends and other whatnot in the domestic business circle. For example, the Big Boss of Endless Virtue Pharmaceutical in your Star City. Old Chen is my long time buddy, of whom was the cause of my visit to Star City twice before.”</p><p>Old Chen?</p><p>Tang Xiu was surprised, “You mean it’s Chen Zhizhong?”</p><p>“Yea, Chen Zhizhong. Ah, Little Brother, you also heard about him?” Fatty Old Li nodded and smiled.</p><p>“Yes!” replied Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Fatty Old Li chuckled and laughed, “No wonder, though. The Endless Virtue Pharmaceutical’s HQ is in Star City, whereas that Old Chen is kinda a celebrity in the business world, so it’s not strange if you know him too. The story of meeting him is kinda a fantasy saga in itself. We were both members of a martial arts society and he beat me badly back then. Afterwards, I went to Star City twice, finding him for a fight. My grandma, that guy’s strength is darn good. Every time I feel that I made progress and look for him, he’s always a step ahead of me.”</p><p>The smile on Tang Xiu’s face was getting thicker. This Fatty Old Li was mocking himself without the slightest embarrassment, yet it caused Tang Xiu to have some favorable impression of him. Oftentimes, those who were telling the truth about their weaknesses to others were the sort of people who had frank and good characters.</p><p>“Chen Zhizhong indeed has a good strength. You will perhaps be beaten by him more miserably if you go to Star City now,” said Tang Xiu whilst letting out a faint smile.</p><p>The Fatty Old Li stared blankly for a second as he asked in amazement, “Do you know him?”</p><p>“Yea, I know him!” said Tang Xiu with a nod.</p><p>Sizing up Tang Xiu yet again, Fatty Old Li probed, “To be acquaintances with Chen Zhizhong is not something someone who has simple capital can do. Little Bro, your background is kinda unusual, no? Tell this Old Bro of yours, what does your family do in Star City?”</p><p>“I’m only a student who was just admitted to university. I’ll have to register myself to university in September. Only, I have set up a small business there and usually tamper with some medicinal herbs. Hence, the reason I know him,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Old Li understood in an instant. Still, he was surprised as he let out a sigh and exclaimed in praise, “You’re amazing, Little Bro! You started your own business at such a young age? Damn, when I was at your age, I only knew how to flirt with chicks and hang out with my buddies to drink, playing with them every day.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
