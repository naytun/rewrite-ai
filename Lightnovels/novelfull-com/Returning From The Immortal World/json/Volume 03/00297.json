He was indeed puzzled by the attitude shown by Tom Reggie toward Viviani. Now, he understood. Viviani, inside Tom Reggie’s mind, was but someone with more money than sense.</p><p>“It’s not only because I’m rich, though. I also saved him! I coincidently helped him solve some troubles when he offended some people in Latin America a few years ago. Hence, he has been very respectful to ever since.”</p><p>Tang Xiu understood in a flash and forced a smile, “Can’t you finish talking at one go? I also think that Tom seems to treat you like a hillbilly money-bag and wants to get more profits from you!”</p><p>“Hmph!” Viviani snorted. “The Chinese call it spendthrift and foolish, no? But don’t take it for granted, though. Unless I want to throw my money, nobody will get even a dime from me.”</p><p>“Where did you get so much money from? Care to teach me your money-making secret?” asked Tang Xiu curiously.</p><p>Without any concern at all, Viviani said, “I got no problem teaching you! You just need to fiercely beat those who provoke you and force them to pay, that’s all. Those dark forces who kick people around and have ill-gotten wealth are holding money that shouldn’t belong to them. So I pack them up fiercely and make them pay a big price.”</p><p>A weird expression appeared Tang Xiu’s face as his mouth twitched a few times. It was truly a miracle for Viviani to survive until now, since she had poor combat experience despite her powerful strength.</p><p>However, Tang Xiu admitted that this method was indeed a good way to make money fast. For instance, those four big shots in Hong Kong who provoked him. Wasn’t the profit he’d gotten from them only a little more than 10 billion?</p><p>As he thought up to there, Tang Xiu shook his head, for he couldn’t approve such a method of committing an offense and offending people.</p><p>Nowadays, thieves who stole were not that fearsome, but instead were those thieves with scheming minds that you needed to look out for. Though he was powerful, but were he to offend too many dark forces, he would have to face numerous enemies dealing with him. He may slay one or two bunches, but could he be able to do the same against 100, 200 parties?</p><p>Furthermore, there were still friends and relatives he must take into account, since troubles would descend upon those he cared if those people were to retaliate.</p><p>“Vivi, you had better not do this kind of thing again in the future. You can invest in businesses, spending money to make money, since you’re rich now. If you keep offending those dark forces and they get thoroughly angered, they might desperately take revenge on you. I’m afraid you will have to face unexpected mishaps. If by chance they retaliate on your family, you might be able to protect yourself, but will you be able to protect your loved ones?”</p><p>Viviani was stunned and dazed as her pace abruptly stopped. Her mouth opened, yet not the slightest sound came out.</p><p>Seeing such abnormal reaction from her, Tang Xiu was confused, “Hey, what happened to you?”</p><p>Viviani didn’t respond. Her eyes blanked out as though she was devoid of her soul, standing there like a statue. The reflecting moonlight on her golden hair made her look dazzling.</p><p>“Murderous aura?”</p><p>Tang Xiu had a change in his expression. The murderous aura he could feel from Viviani was not only strong, but a real one.</p><p>As Viviani eventually overcame her daze, a chilling light filled her eyes as she forced herself to look to Tang Xiu and speak with an cold-ice tone, “I finally figured out as to why my father had a sudden, unexpected car accident that claimed his life seven years ago; why the electric wire was broken and my mother was electrocuted to the death in her bathtub at home five years ago. I finally know why the house suddenly collapsed and killed my only younger brother inside three years ago. I finally realized why uncle got conned and was ripped off from his wealth, finally forcing him to commit suicide…”</p><p>Tang Xiu was stunned before he said with disbelief on his face, “Are you suspecting all those weren’t a coincidence, but were the retaliation from someone?</p><p>Whilst tightly gripping her fist, the murderous intent glowing in Viviani’s eyes intensified. Fury filled her eyes as she spoke, “I’m sure it was their revenge, because not even one of my family members remains—all of them had died. Even our kind neighbor—Grandma Bessie died by a stone thrown from the footbridge when she went out to the grocery.”</p><p>‘It truly is not far out from that!’ sighed Tang Xiu inside.</p><p>Quickly putting on her shoes, Viviani then turned around and ran away.</p><p>“Hey, where are you going?” asked Tang Xiu loudly.</p><p>“I will kill them! They will pay the most painful price no matter who they are!” replied Viviani loudly.</p><p>Knitting his brows, Tang Xiu wanted to remind her not to act out of emotions. Even if she wanted to find the murderer who killed her relatives, still, she had to investigate it slowly. The incidents happened many years ago, after all. But he eventually gave up when he recalled the extent of his relationship with her.</p><p>He just only met her today. Only because they chatted a bit and a joke that ended up with a kiss, still, all those couldn’t be considered of them having a close relationship whatsoever.</p><p>‘I have to follow her! I too hope she can find the murderer who killed her family members and survive,’ secretly sighing inside, Tang Xiu then turned around and walked into the villa.</p><p>Inside, Tom Reggie was holding a crystal cup and chatting with Old Fatty Li. Behind them was Mo Awen who had just woken up from his meditation; and it was evident that his cultivation was improved. At this time, he was carrying cakes and quickly eating them.</p><p>“Mr. Tang, where’s Ms. Vivi?”</p><p>“She has an urgent matter, so she left,” replied Tang Xiu, smiling lightly.</p><p>Puzzled, Tom Reggie asked, “Ms. Vivi has left? Did she return back to her villa? Or…”</p><p>“She should be returning back to her villa, but she may leave the resort soon,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Curious, Tom Reggie asked, “You seem to know the reason why Ms. Vivi left, Mr. Tang. Could you tell me about it?”</p><p>Tang Xiu thought about it for a moment and felt it was fine to tell Tom Reggie. After all, Vivian was Tom Reggie’s benefactor. Recalling her personality, the sudden realization that her family members died due to murder and not accident would certainly drive her into anger and affect her judgment. If Tom Reggie met and assisted Viviani on his behalf and then helped her, it would be good.</p><p>“She’s going to have her revenge! She just found that her relatives were murdered.”</p><p>Stunned, Tom Reggie nodded, “I know Ms. Vivi is very strong as I witnessed how she hit several ruthless individuals half-dead once. She should be able to get revenge for her family members easily.”</p><p>“You’re too optimistic. Though I don’t know her much, her hatred seems to be shrouding her reason, which may render her vulnerable this time,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tom’s expression changed. He was fully aware how vulnerable people could be without having a clear mind. In this age, force and wisdom were equally important. If someone secretly attacked her while she was unprepared, she would easily be killed!</p><p>After thinking up to there, Tom Reggie quickly said, “Mr. Tang, I intended to accompany you in tonight’s banquet, but I’m rather worried about Viviani. So I would like to see her if you don’t mind it.”</p><p>“Alright. Go!” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>Tom Reggie quickly left after replying.</p><p>Looking at Mo Awen who was wolfing down and gobbling up something, Tang Xiu was rather surprised as he approached him and asked, “Why are you behaving like you’re the embodiment of a hungry devil? I saw you eating since I came back, and yet you haven’t eaten to the full till now?”</p><p>Gulping down everything, Mo Awen laughed, “Boss, I don’t know what happened. After I finished cultivating, I found my that cultivation seemed to have improved greatly and felt very hungry—so hungry I could devour a fat cow.”</p><p>Tang Xiu couldn’t bear laughing, “So, you’re much stronger than before now?”</p><p>“I should be 50% stronger. Maybe twice stronger if you give me two days more,” said Mo Awen confidently.</p><p>\"Good!\" Tang Xiu nodded in satisfaction.</p><p>Lao Bay Resort.</p><p>Inside one of the visitor villas, Viviani was smashing everything inside while rummaging her belongings. Though she was clueless who the murderers behind-the-scenes were, but she firmly believed she could find them; killing them and having her revenge.</p><p>“I will kill them, whoever they are!” shouted Viviani in anger as she stuffed her things into the opened suitcase.</p><p>“Knock, knock…”</p><p>The door was knocked as Tom Reggie’s voice came through it, “Ms. Vivi, it’s Tom here. I need to talk about something with you.”</p><p>Walking to the door and opening it, she then asked with a frosty expression, “What are you here for? Anything you want to tell me?”</p><p>Wearing respectful expression, Tom Reggie replied, “I just met Mr. Tang and he told me about your matter. Ms. Vivi, you’re my benefactor, so I must repay your kindness. However, I think you ought to listen to me pertaining your endeavor to seek your mortal enemies and have your revenge.”</p><p>“Say it!” Viviani said with heaviness in her voice.</p><p>“There’s an old proverb in China that ten years are not too long a time for a gentleman to exact his revenge. At present, you don’t know who your mortal enemies are and on whom you should exact your revenge. Hence, I think what you need to do now is to use everything you have in store to find those murderers, investigate their backgrounds and then devise a plan,” said Tom Reggie.</p><p>“NO! I can wait no longer!” shouted Viviani angrily.</p><p>Sighing inside, Tom Reggie then said solemnly, “Ms. Vivi, Mr. Tang just told me that anger and hatred may have shrouded your state of mind. I somewhat didn’t believe it at first, because in my eyes you are a noble, elegant, graceful and resplendent Goddess who is full of wisdom. But now I have to believe Mr. Tang’s judgment. You have really been blinded by anger and hatred, thus will lose your rationality over things.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
