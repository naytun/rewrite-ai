As he watched his son’s calm expression, he curiously asked, “2.5 billion is not a small sum. Where did you get so much money? As far as I know, the Magnificent Tang Corp has been investing all their time in production and hasn’t made any profits yet.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, Dad!” said Tang Xiu and continued, “The money is clean. But I have one more thing to tell you, and it’s not about the money.”</p><p>“What is it?” asked Tang Yunde, puzzled.</p><p>“Are you not curious about why I have apprentices?” asked Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Yunde was surprised for a moment as his expression turned serious immediately. He nodded and said, “I am indeed puzzled by this. That little girl—Yinyin’s mouth is way too tight, she doesn’t tell me a thing. If she is your only apprentice, then it’s understandable. But for the boss of Endless Virtue Pharmaceutical—the dignified, rich and affluent person with 10 billion in assets—Chen Zhizhong to even worship you as Master and even revere you just leaves me perplexed despite much thought.”</p><p>“I have sort of cultivation techniques, the sort of thing like you heard in fables and myths -- cultivation to become immortal. They accepted me as their Master to cultivate to immortality,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Yunde laughed involuntarily, “Xiu’er, you’re not bluffing and deceiving me, are you? Where in the world would this immortality cultivation exist?”</p><p>Tang Xiu said solemnly, “Dad, believe it or not, the world is big and nothing is too strange within it. There are all sorts of inconceivable things that ordinary people are unable to come in contact with. Besides, I’m not the only one, there are also other cultivators like me in the country. Just look at my age, how can I otherwise have the ability to rescue and wake you up from a coma?”</p><p>“It’s real?”</p><p>The smile on Tang Yunde’s face finally froze as he asked in astonishment.</p><p>“It’s true. However, you’re already old, and excessively lost your spirit and vital force for two decades. I’m going to give a diet medication prescription for you and mom to eat every day. Six months later, I can teach you how to practice immortal cultivation,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“What do you mean by practicing immortal cultivation, what is the effect exactly? Can I really become immortal?” asked Tang Yunde.</p><p>Tang Xiu slanted his brows as his figure instantly disappeared in front of Tang Yunde. In the next moment, his body appeared in the door as he said, “What do you think about this speed?”</p><p>\"So fast?\"</p><p>Shaken, Tang Yunde was startled inside and could only see the shocking scene in his sight. As Tang Xiu then sat the opposite him, the wave tides inside his heart were still raging endlessly and he couldn’t calm himself for a long time.</p><p>“My speed and strength are a hundred times that of average people. But even in this state, my cultivation base is still very low. If I’m able to achieve the great accomplishment level, toppling mountains and overturning seas would be a cinch for me,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>Tang Yunde’s mouth twitched a few times. With a fiery look in his eyes, Tang Xiu said, “I have to learn it. You must teach me six months later.”</p><p>Prior to this, he didn’t have much hope of revenge since the enemies were simply too powerful. Powerful to the extent that he even dreaded it inside. However, if he were to practice immortal cultivation technique and it really greatly increased his strength, by that time his revenge would be much easier.</p><p>After the conversation ended, Tang Xiu and Tang Yunde went to the living room together.</p><p>Showing keen insight, Su Lingyun could clearly feel that her son and husband seemed to be a lot closer, making her very happy.</p><p>“Xiu’er, you must leave for Shanghai tomorrow. What else you need to prepare?”</p><p>Tang Xiu shook his head and laughed, “There’s nothing to prepare, Mom. I just need to bring some clothes. Besides, if I lack anything, I can buy it myself.”</p><p>Su Lingyun nodded and then took a bank card from her pocket. She handed it to Tang Xiu and said, “Xiu’er, mom is giving you this for your living expenses. There’s 100 thousand yuan here. Use it if you lack anything, and if it’s not enough, tell me!”</p><p>Tang Xiu was at a loss whether he had to be amused or cry, “Mom, I have money! You…”</p><p>Su Lingyun interrupted him, “I know that you have money, but Mom has prepared it for you, so you must accept it! You must study hard in Shanghai, and learn many things while you’re still young.”</p><p>“I know, mom!” Tang Xiu nodded.</p><p>****</p><p>The next day, Tang Xiu was dragged by his mother to go shopping as she bought him a lot of clothes to wear. Slowly, the trunk of the Land Rover SUV was stuffed. Were it not for Tang Xiu persuading her to stop, Su Lingyun wouldn’t have stopped!</p><p>In the afternoon.</p><p>Tang Xiu came to the Magnificent Tang Corp HQ and directly passed the gate since the security outside already knew him. When he came to the General Manager’s office, he heard some people arguing inside.</p><p>“Chief Kang, you gotta give me this chance! I assure I can manage this handsomely.”</p><p>“You can for everything else, but not this one. The winery needs you there, so you gotta stay. I’ll take Su Quan with me. He’s very clever and he works smoothly anyways.”</p><p>“Chief Kang, I don’t get it. You need to deal with a lot of stuff for our Magnificent Tang Corp. Why did you have to leave for Shanghai yourself? You see, I had people prepare me a speech, and I’ve already memorized it.”</p><p>“I have my own intentions in going to Shanghai.”</p><p>When Tang Xiu heard up to there, he revealed a faint smile. He knocked the door and then pushed it open. After entering, he saw Kang Xia sitting by her desk while Scarblade Qiang stood in front of her, looking distressed.</p><p>“Boss?”</p><p>The moment she saw Tang Xiu, Kang Xia’s eyes suddenly turned bright and leaped up from the sofa as she strode in a rush toward Tang Xiu along with tenderness that suffused inside her eyes.</p><p>It’s been more than a month! She missed Tang Xiu so much that she couldn’t taste any food.</p><p>Were it not because the Magnificent Tang Corp required her attention, she would have really rushed to Nine Dragons Island to see Tang Xiu.</p><p>Scarblade Qiang also looked a bit surprised upon seeing Tang Xiu’s arrival. However, when he saw Kang Xia looking like a young girl in love as she quickly ran toward Tang Xiu and intimately held his arm, his smile immediately coagulated.</p><p>“You gotta go to Shanghai for the Wine Tasting Conference yourself?” laughed Tang Xiu.</p><p>“I thought you wouldn’t come back to Star City and would directly go to Shanghai to study directly after coming back from abroad! So, I wanted to go to Shanghai to see you!” said Kang Xia with a laugh.</p><p>Faintly smiling at her in response, Tang Xiu then looked at Scarblade Qiang and said, “Alright, Kang Xia will go to Shanghai for the Wine Tasting Conference! We have brewed fine wine so we gotta make it explode in the domestic circle. And the Wine Tasting Conference is the perfect event to do that.”</p><p>As for Scarblade Qiang himself, his sight exchanged from Kang Xia to Tang Xiu as a forced, wry smile appeared on his rough face. He now understood the reason why Kang Xia refused him leaving for Shanghai. It turned out that she wanted to go there no just to attend the Wine Tasting Conference, but the more important purpose was to see her lover!</p><p>“I got it, Boss!”</p><p>Though he was rather depressed inside, since Scarblade Qiang learned Kang Xia’s true purpose, he knew that he had no chance to go to Shanghai.</p><p>“How’s the winery?” asked Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>“I’ve done everything you’ve told me, Boss. The number of bottles in our winery inventory has reached a full 20 thousand. Though we only have two production lines now, we’ll have it increased to five production lines within up to two months. The wine can be sent out from the storehouse once Chief Kang orders it, so we can immediately ship them to the major stores across the country for external sales,” said Scarblade Qiang.</p><p>“Remember. Our winery produces fine wine, so we can’t throw too much of the product into the market. I’ve been reading marketing books recently and I found a very interesting marketing method,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>“What marketing method?” asked Scarblade Qiang, confused.</p><p>“Hunger Marketing,” said Tang Xiu.</p><p>At the side, Kang Xia looked surprised, “Boss, you mean to learn from Apple’s marketing method—the limited sales?”</p><p>“That’s right,” Tang Xiu nodded and said, “Our wine annual sales mustn’t exceed 100 thousand bottles. According to our previous fixed pricing, with 10 thousand per each bottle, we’ll get one billion in revenue from 100 thousand bottles.”</p><p>Kang Xia forced a smiled and said, “Boss, though it’s a lot of revenue,…”</p><p>“I know. One billion of revenue is too few for us. But we have to look into long-term profits. I think you should also understand about some know-how and whatnot. Since we’ll do limited sales and the market is really in short supply, the price could be doubled. By that time, we’ll throw some more products from our winery. This will be our very objective!”</p><p>Kang Xia’s eyes lightened up as she said with a smile, “I got it.”</p><p>Tang Xiu nodded and then looked at Scarblade Qiang, asking, “Do you have any other matters?”</p><p>Scarblade Qiang shook his head, “No.”</p><p>Having said that, he suddenly realized that Tang Xiu was hinting for him to leave! A look of understanding immediately appeared on his rough face as he chuckled with a smile and then left.</p><p>After Tang Xiu sat down on the sofa, he looked at Kang Xia who sat at the opposite and asked, “How is the company? What about the cosmetics and the healthcare products?”</p><p>“We’ve amassed the products, but our company is low on liquid funds at the moment,” said Kang Xia.</p><p>Tang Xiu took out his mobile phone and directly transferred one billion to the company’s bank account and then said with a smile, “I told you to tell me if there’s no money. I may have no other abilities, but nevertheless, I’m still able to make some money. Anyways, I’ve transferred one billion to the company’s account. It’s your call how you’re going to spend it.”</p><p>1 billion?</p><p>Kang Xia’s eyes turned bright and was pleasantly surprised when she replied, “With one billion, I can assure you that our cosmetics and healthcare products will be out of inventory and shipped to the major stores across the country before October 1st. We can also start selling on the same day.”</p><p>“You call the shots. Alright, I just heard Su Quan being mentioned when I was in front of the door! Is he doing well?” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>Kang Xia exclaimed in praise, “He’s a very clever young man. He knows how to read people’s gestures and weigh up their words as well how to behave. When he first worked as a security guard in the winery, he solved two problems by himself. I then appointed him as vice-director of the winery and he showcased very strong capabilities. Scarblade Qiang is very dependent on him now. If he is to be trained well, he will be a very important senior executive in our Magnificent Tang Corporation’s management in the future.”</p><p>“That kiddo has always been a smart one ever since he was a child,” said Tang Xiu with a smile.</p><p>In reply, Kang Xia said with a smile, “Some people have entrepreneurial talent from their childhood. Yet, he’s among the best of them. To tell you the truth, if he had capital to run his own business, he’d probably have great achievements.”</p><p>“You have a very high evaluation of him! Since he’s that good, then entrust him with more responsibilities. In short, I know his nature and character rather well, and he’s reliable and can be trusted!” said Tang Xiu.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
